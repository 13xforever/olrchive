0	20160	Tonight, April 29, 2012, the release date leaks for one big game this fall, Nintendo
20160	25280	will bring retail digital downloads to the Wii U, and could Microsoft be planning another
25280	31800	music service?
31800	36480	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to the show where every gamer
36480	39840	has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.
39840	48520	We are live as we are every week at VOG Network, vognetwork.com, six o'clock Pacific, nine
48520	51960	o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.
51960	54840	You can join us in our chat room at vognetwork.com.
54840	57880	I'll be talking more about the chat and some of those changes in just a minute, but my
57880	61560	name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video
61560	62920	games and lols.
62920	66000	With my co-host, say hello to the one and only, Jamie Summers.
66000	67000	Hi.
67000	68000	How are you?
68000	69000	Voggy.
69000	73160	Wait a minute, this isn't a station about volcanic fog.
73160	75280	Wikipedia told me vog is volcanic fog.
75280	76280	What is this?
76280	77840	Wikipedia is wrong.
77840	80680	Alright, also say hello to Techmaster Loki.
80680	81680	Hello.
81680	82680	How you doing, Loki?
82680	83680	I'm full.
83680	84680	You're full, full of crap.
84680	86600	That's the same joke I made with her last week.
86600	88760	I just ate a big pizza.
88760	92120	I just ate some dried okra.
92120	96000	And I have breadsticks staring at me, but I can't, I can literally not fit any more
96000	97160	into my stomach.
97160	99160	So some things never change.
99160	101160	Some things change, but some things never change.
101160	105720	So I am getting hungry, but just looking at those breadsticks is making me hungry.
105720	109940	Alright, so before we get into our gaming weeks, let's talk about the big obvious thing
109940	110940	that's out there.
110940	114920	We weren't able to talk about it last week because we were trying to transition from
114920	117160	the old network to our new network.
117160	118420	And we're not bitches.
118420	119720	Which is VOG.
119720	123720	And if you haven't heard, it's all over now, Geek-Life.com.
123720	126440	Big thank you to Geek Life, by the way, for doing this for us.
126440	131680	Broke the exclusive late last night that the new network that we were starting with Bobby
131680	135640	and Understation Live will also be a part of in its inaugural phase is called VOG, or
135640	138280	the Voice of Geeks Network.
138280	143340	You know, so you can call it Voice of Geeks Network if you want, but ultimately when you
143340	147720	think of VOG, you won't think of volcanoes anymore, you'll think about our network or
147720	151960	the Voice of Geeks Network, which is expanding a little bit, just like when Orange Lounge
151960	155480	Radio, remember Orange Lounge Radio was a station when it first started.
155480	159800	So in some ways this is going back to those roots a little bit, but so much bigger now.
159800	160800	Our eyes are...
160800	161800	We started over.
161800	162800	That's right.
162800	165120	We are starting over.
165120	169840	You know, it's not just about Bomani, it's not just about games, it's about all things
169840	172200	geek is what this station is all about.
172200	175160	And you know, that's going to be reflected in the playlist, that's going to be reflected
175160	179280	in, you know, the shows that you're going to hear on the network, and most importantly,
179280	181020	it's not just a radio network.
181020	187480	The VOG network is going to be a whole website that has other things as well, forums and
187480	192300	you know, other ways to interact with folks and some really exciting maybe meta games.
192300	195400	I don't want to spoil too much, but just say there's great things in store for VOG.
195400	200360	The site that you see there now at vognetwork.com, kind of a temporary, what we call the phase
200360	203360	one, so that you guys have a way to continue to listen to us.
203360	207640	And so that way our shows aren't interrupted at all, but the later phases are going to
207640	208640	bring more.
208640	213780	More shows to the radio network, more things to see and do on the website.
213780	215040	It's going to be great.
215040	219960	So going to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.
219960	222560	Let's see, who do I give the first chat comment to tonight?
222560	227600	I'm going to give it to Hecht, who calls VOG the voice of God network.
227600	231200	No, that's a whole other network.
231200	234360	That might be, you know, got to go through the religious programming to get that.
234360	239540	And if you pay us $50,000, you'll be guaranteed a place in heaven.
239540	247080	Speaking of chat, we're saying goodbye to our old chat room, which was at chat.orangeloungeradio.com,
247080	249660	and it was Channel Orange Lounge on IRC.
249660	251240	We're saying goodbye to that.
251240	255400	And I know some people are like, I don't like change, why do things have to change?
255400	261400	But we wanted to, you know, for a long time when we were at our old home, we had one chat
261400	265120	room, they had another, and things always felt really disconnected.
265120	267060	And it was a little weird.
267060	271840	So we wanted to make sure this time we did it right, and we merge into the general network
271840	272840	chat room.
272840	276660	Especially the fact that the shows that are all starting this network have a lot of listener
276660	278080	overlap anyway.
278080	281860	It really made sense to kind of have a central home or a hub for that.
281860	285580	So our new chat room is Channel VOG.
285580	289960	It's still on the game search network, and if you want to join it really easy using the
289960	293520	Java or whatever, the chat client online, just go to vognetwork.com.
293520	294980	It's like, you can't miss it.
294980	295980	It's right in front of your face.
295980	299860	It's like the biggest thing on the page right now, vognetwork.com, and you will see the
299860	301040	chat.
301040	304920	You don't have to use vognetwork.com to listen to the station.
304920	309760	You have little things that you can copy paste into Winamp and mobile phones and all that.
309760	313320	That is going to be developing all through the coming weeks.
313320	316140	I do want to put this out there for the podcast listeners.
316140	320200	Those that are listening on the podcast, nothing's changed for them.
320200	321920	They're just like, oh, hey, another week, another show.
321920	322920	Here it is.
322920	324960	It sounds the same as it always has, and that's the intention.
324960	326920	It's not supposed to sound any different to you guys.
326920	331900	If you do happen to visit VOG Network during the week, keep in mind we don't have the stream
331900	334540	up 24-7 yet.
334540	338400	That is part of phase two that's going to be implemented within the next couple weeks.
338400	339400	It's going to be fast.
339400	342720	I just don't want you to be surprised if you go to vognetwork.com and it's not Saturday
342720	345720	night or Sunday night, because Saturday is when another station live is on, Sunday is
345720	349060	when we're on with Bobby, you're not going to hear anything.
349060	350880	That's going to be that way for a couple weeks.
350880	355200	We're slowly expanding with the network.
355200	356840	I'm so excited.
356840	357840	It's great.
357840	363320	Sitting at the driver's wheel, being part of having created this, getting to steer this
363320	368360	site in the direction we want to take it for geeks everywhere, and giving everybody a voice
368360	372800	through radio shows, through feature articles, through forums.
372800	374540	It's going to be awesome.
374540	375540	So excited.
375540	380040	All right, so anyhow, let's get back into video games and talk about our gaming week
380040	383800	and so forth, and the stuff we've been playing in the gaming world this week.
383800	385160	Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?
385160	386160	I ain't played shit.
386160	387160	No, I'm kidding.
387160	388160	What?
388160	394240	Well, and then I reformatted my hard drive and installed Windows 7, only to find out
394240	401560	that I'm missing my entire iTunes collection from about S down, including my ringtones
401560	402560	directory.
402560	406640	So I've lost most of the ringtones that I've made, including my Doctor Who theme from season
406640	409240	10, which makes me irritated beyond all belief.
409240	410240	Well, this is the interweb.
410240	411760	Surely you can find that in a heartbeat.
411760	412960	I made that one.
412960	416160	And the VoG network probably has it in the upcoming playlist.
416160	424040	For anyone who I've ever sent those ringtones to, just send them back to me, please.
424040	427080	So I played some WoW.
427080	428480	I've finally gotten the beta.
428480	433600	Well, I mean, I had the beta key, I just wasn't beta-ing.
433600	434960	Now I am beta-ing.
434960	439460	I've made a panda named Sakurina.
439460	444400	Every time I try to play my 85s that I transferred over, the game crashes on me.
444400	445760	Oops.
445760	448660	So yeah.
448660	456000	And then we were loaned the Tekken Street Fighter poop game, because my friend bought
456000	460320	it on PS3 and promptly said, this is broken, and loaned it to us.
460320	463400	He said, you can play it, I hate it.
463400	469240	So we were going to play it, but things have been busy with me trying to do everything.
469240	474840	And Tigerclaw, I backed up my entire iTunes directory, let it finish, double-checked it,
474840	476480	and somehow half of it was still missing.
476480	477800	So shut up.
477800	479360	You're so nice.
479360	480520	I know.
480520	482520	I'm a wonderful person.
482520	486720	By the way, Tigerclaw had suggested that this is why I make a backup of my entire iTunes
486720	488400	library on a second hard drive.
488400	490040	That's what I did.
490040	499920	So anyway, at any rate, it's just been me trying to play catch-up and working, and I
499920	501880	have two more weeks of school.
501880	502880	Then I'm going to Disneyland.
502880	503880	Oh.
503880	504880	Oh, congrats.
504880	508280	I wish I could go, but I don't think it's going to work out, just with everything else
508280	509280	going on.
509280	510280	Yeah.
510280	511280	Okay.
511280	512280	LOL, bye.
512280	513280	Bye.
513280	514280	You want to feature me for me?
514280	516280	Yeah, we can talk about that offline.
516280	517280	Why not?
517280	518280	All right.
518280	519280	Techmaster Loki, how was your gaming week?
519280	520280	What'd you do?
520280	523080	I played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3.
523080	524080	That's pretty much it.
524080	531400	Leveled up to 80 offline through some grinding with split-screen Surge and Destroy, which
531400	534440	is a lot faster than the way I was trying to do it.
534440	537600	So we did that, and it's sort of cheating, but who cares?
537600	540960	We're playing offline, so it doesn't matter.
540960	545760	So yeah, that's pretty much all I've played, and then I've been continuing, because I had
545760	554040	started it, god, months ago, but I have been continuing on working on my full-size Papercraft
554040	559920	model of a Portal turret that's about three and a half feet tall, when it will be three
559920	563640	and a half feet tall when it's done.
563640	566600	So I posted a picture in the chat room.
566600	572600	What I have done so far is pretty much the two shells of the actual body minus the gun
572600	576040	doors on there, because those are actually separate pieces, and you can actually make
576040	578960	it with the guns, but I'm not.
578960	581160	I'm just going to keep the doors shut.
581160	582160	Makes it easier.
582160	587040	By the way, we probably should get Rama to put that to the Tumblr, so the podcast listeners
587040	589760	can see this thing that you're building.
589760	590760	We can do it.
590760	591760	All right.
591760	593680	What made you decide you wanted to build this?
593680	594680	Because you can't.
594680	595680	I've known you how long.
595680	596680	Because you can.
596680	597680	You're like, challenge?
597680	598680	Challenge accepted!
598680	603200	It's because it's the cheapest way to get in.
603200	605280	How can I annoy my wife this month?
605280	606980	It's not annoying.
606980	610480	It was actually, this was the cheapest way to go.
610480	613080	This is one of the least annoying projects, I'm sure.
613080	614080	It's just cutting paper.
614080	619400	I mean, it's actually, I think it's cost me so far like 20 bucks, and that's only because
619400	623320	I bought the wrong thickness paper at one point.
623320	629820	But it's just like card stock with glue, the special glue because it's quick drying and
629820	631640	works great.
631640	636760	And then just an X-Acto blade and stuff, but it's coming out pretty well.
636760	641560	The only thing is, once I'm done putting it together, I've got to spray it because it's
641560	647160	got lines all over the place, and then once I'm done spraying it, I have to possibly add
647160	650040	a laser and voice to it as well.
650040	651720	And then you should sell it for a lot of money on Etsy.
651720	652720	No!
652720	653720	It's going to my desk!
653720	657440	And it's not going to be just a regular Portal turret.
657440	661600	It's going to be the, what is it, the one from Portal 2 that you save.
661600	664560	Excuse me, excuse me!
664560	666200	No, that sounds awesome.
666200	667840	I can't wait to see the finished product.
667840	669000	I know you'll bring it to the show.
669000	670000	I will bring it to the show.
670000	671000	I know you will.
671000	672280	It'll be great.
672280	676280	So that whole video content we want to add to VOG eventually, there'll just be a static
676280	677600	camera pointing at your Portal gun.
677600	678600	Sounds good.
678600	679600	Very ominous.
679600	680840	Alright, so my gaming week.
680840	683720	I wish, I was reading some of the comments in chat room, and earlier somebody had brought
683720	687840	up Phantasy Star Online 2, and the whole beta that's going on.
687840	691720	I wish I was playing that, but I guess it's only in Japanese right now, which stinks.
691720	693720	I really want to check that out at some point.
693720	698280	I've had a lot of friends beta testing MMOs this week.
698280	702400	Guild Wars 2 apparently has got their thing going on for people that pre-purchased the
702400	703400	game.
703400	707240	Like, if you already gave them your money, you get to play the game a little early.
707240	708600	It's like an open beta test.
708600	710480	I was going to say, isn't it coming out soon?
710480	711800	Yeah, it's pretty soon.
711800	715720	I am interested in the game, and for those that remember Irene, she used to go by Rice
715720	716920	Princess years ago on this show.
716920	720200	If you remember Irene, she's really into Guild Wars, especially this new one, and she says
720200	722440	the PVP is awesome.
722440	725280	So I'm curious to check that out.
725280	729000	Xtaphir from Hoard House has been playing Terra, which is apparently pretty good.
729000	732740	You can make some very fancy pants looking characters in Terra, so I want to check that
732740	735440	out too, because the graphics in that look really good.
735440	739080	But the MMO that's been taking up my week is of course World of Warcraft.
739080	740320	Hello, what else?
740320	746840	But I have been playing some offline games as well on the Xbox 360, and again, note the
746840	750680	day, note the time, other big news besides the new network.
750680	753440	I didn't just beat one game this year, you guys.
753440	755560	I beat two games this year!
755560	756560	Applause, please.
756560	757560	Good job.
757560	758560	Thank you.
758560	759560	Good job.
759560	763760	So Mass Effect, right, and the new game I beat, Mass Effect 2.
763760	769880	Congratulations, your freight train of soon or intimate disappointment is full speed ahead.
769880	771520	Here's my quote for you.
771520	774680	Yeah, thank you, thank you.
774680	778800	So of course, the other day, I think that was what, probably Monday?
778800	783240	But Rob, when are you going to beat a game that came out this year?
783240	789920	Well, well, smartass, I just started Mass Effect 3!
789920	795000	Go figure, it was on sale for 40 bucks a couple weeks ago, so I picked up a copy of Mass Effect
795000	798360	3, so I had it ready to go, and away I went.
798360	804200	So I've been playing that a little bit, and I gotta say, just like some things, some little
804200	808000	things changed from Mass Effect 1 to Mass Effect 2, more things changed from Mass Effect
808000	811400	3, and I'm really loving it.
811400	818000	Oh my gosh, the story is great, there's much more direct tie-ins to what, like, you see
818000	822760	much more impact from what happened in Game 2, in Game 3, than you really saw between
822760	823760	1 and 2.
823760	827920	It's like they perfected that a little bit, and thankfully, since I say, I may or may
827920	832680	not have had my boyfriend walk me through the final sequence of Part 2, so that way
832680	837520	everybody would stay alive so I could see them in Part 3, so it's really cool getting
837520	843080	to run into everybody and see them in Part 3, and, you know, just the combat is so much
843080	844080	better.
844080	847720	Like, even though they didn't really change a lot, like it's still, you know, you have
847720	852640	your guns and use your powers, everything just feels more fluid, like I can't explain
852640	857000	it, like, and just the graphics are up a notch, it's great, I'm having such a good time with
857000	858000	3.
858000	864080	And, here's the crazy part, I'm playing multiplayer, because Mass Effect 3 has a whole multiplayer
864080	868600	thing online that you can go in, and it's basically, it's all co-op, it's not competitive,
868600	874280	you basically do these 4-player co-op matches, and, you know, it's not, it's not as rich
874280	878680	and as full as the main game, but you know that whole thing that apparently every game
878680	882080	has to have multiplayer these days, especially if you're EA, right?
882080	886400	So, Mass Effect now has this multiplayer mode, and it's basically 4-player co-op surviving
886400	892880	10 waves on a map, and it's 10 waves of enemies, but that could be, you know, little enemies,
892880	898200	big enemies, it could be hold a point on the map for a minute, it could be go find the
898200	901880	different markers on the map and activate the beacons or whatever, within a certain
901880	904600	amount of time, there are little modes that they put in it.
904600	907080	But the fact that it's co-op makes it really interesting.
907080	911540	Now, so I've said a lot of great things about Mass Effect 3, right, and I really do truly
911540	916320	love this game, and even if the ending blows ass, which I'm fully expecting it to, I've
916320	920400	already been set up for disappointment, the experience of getting there is fine, like
920400	924960	I feel like, especially because I bought it on sale, it's been money well spent.
924960	930760	By the way, even though I bought these games on sale, I bought every single DLC, well every
930760	938200	single like story DLC for part 2, and I beat all of those as well, Shadow Broker, Arrival,
938200	943700	Overlord, Kasumi, Zaid, I played all of it, so yeah, and that was a very important thing
943700	946320	I had to do before I started 3.
946320	952760	So, speaking of online and DLC, here's my problem with Mass Effect 3, and this is a
952760	958160	big problem, and this is my, this is why I'm going to be hesitant to give this my game
958160	965560	of the year, extremely hesitant to give this my game of the year award, and it's basically
965560	969760	the blatant money grab the EA is going for with this.
969760	975760	In multiplayer, you don't level the same character that you level in single player.
975760	980920	You level your character in multiplayer, and the way you do that is that you earn credits
980920	982480	with every map that you do.
982480	986000	The more waves you survive, the more you contribute, the more credits you get, and if you manage
986000	989680	to make it all the way to the end and get airlifted out, you get a lot of credits.
989680	994200	And you use the credits to buy little boxes that are akin to like a Magic the Gathering
994200	995340	booster pack.
995340	1001600	You can buy a cheapy box for 5,000 that'll have cheapy stuff in it, you can buy a slightly
1001600	1007620	better box for 20,000 credits that has, you know, better stuff and are rare, and then
1007620	1012220	you can buy like a jumbo box for 60,000 that has like super rare or whatever in it, I'm
1012220	1013880	kind of paraphrasing here.
1013880	1015640	But where am I going with this?
1015640	1022040	Not only can you buy the boxes with in-game credits, but you can buy the boxes with Microsoft
1022040	1026120	points, and I'm assuming on the PlayStation 3 you can buy it with, you know, PlayStation
1026120	1030640	store dollars, and on the PC I'm sure you can tap into their EA network and buy them
1030640	1031640	as well.
1031640	1035640	So, in other words, you can use money to get ahead in the game.
1035640	1042640	And the other thing that's a little bit irritating with that is that if you want the A-plus best
1042640	1047080	way to get through the game, you really have to play multiplayer, because multiplayer ties
1047080	1052120	into this event called Galactic Readiness that starts at half, 50%.
1052120	1055920	The more you play multiplayer, the more the Galactic Readiness goes up.
1055920	1062360	Technically, you can get the best ending if you did everything perfect in Mass Effect
1062360	1065880	1, everything perfect in Mass Effect 2, like you'd have to use a guide online to do it.
1065880	1069320	You would absolutely have to use a guide online in order to be able to do it and never touch
1069320	1070320	multiplayer.
1070320	1074600	So, in other words, if you want the best ending, which as I understand there isn't that big
1074600	1079220	of a difference anyway between them, but by the time the DLC comes out maybe that'll change.
1079220	1083800	If you want the best in single player, you have to play multiplayer, and real money gives
1083800	1088960	you the edge in order to kind of get there as fast as possible, because they didn't already
1088960	1091040	take your money when you bought the game.
1091040	1093680	It makes me not want to play.
1093680	1095800	It's kind of shitty.
1095800	1103440	And that EA, that's why you make gamers so angry that they rigged that poll to go vote
1103440	1107160	you the worst company in America whether you deserved it or not.
1107160	1109040	That's the problem.
1109040	1112960	And I think it needs to be called out, because guess what, gaming industry?
1112960	1115880	You can't have your cake and eat it too.
1115880	1120200	You don't get to charge people that type of money for a game up front and the additional
1120200	1124100	DLC and then charge the money for Pokemon packs.
1124100	1125100	And I know what you're saying.
1125100	1126880	Well, if you don't like it, then don't buy it.
1126880	1128200	Rob, it's only gonna get worse.
1128200	1129200	I know.
1129200	1132760	I mean, we're gonna get into it later, but we've already gotten a glimpse of the future
1132760	1136520	and it's only gonna get worse.
1136520	1140560	AcidicVampire in chat says, yes, but Rob, buying them with money is just an option.
1140560	1144760	If you beat them multiplayer on silver and gold, you will be swimming in credits.
1144760	1146320	And I understand that.
1146320	1150000	But there's some people that aren't gonna wanna play multiplayer that are gonna be tempted
1150000	1151400	to do that to give them an edge.
1151400	1152400	Why?
1152400	1154080	Because it ultimately does affect single player.
1154080	1155080	And I think that's a very...
1155080	1156080	I hate multiplayer.
1156080	1157080	See, that's a poor decision.
1157080	1158080	That was a...
1158080	1159080	I don't...
1159080	1161960	Any way you slice it, having the multiplayer tie in that close to single player was a poor
1161960	1162960	decision.
1162960	1164680	I really don't wanna play it now.
1164680	1169600	I mean, honestly, it just has deflated any desire how to play it.
1169600	1173520	Well, I think you're robbing yourself of what is otherwise an excellent story and an excellent
1173520	1174520	game.
1174520	1175520	To be honest, I mean...
1175520	1176520	I hate multiplayer games.
1176520	1178440	Unless they're in the house with me.
1178440	1182040	Technically, you don't have to play multiplayer, you just won't get the best ending.
1182040	1183040	Exactly.
1183040	1186280	Well, even the best ending, it doesn't even matter, because you can actually play multiplayer.
1186280	1190240	Well, you wouldn't have to buy those packs necessarily to get the experience that you
1190240	1191240	need.
1191240	1194960	But like, I mean, there's some other games, Saints Row the Third, that just have really
1194960	1201160	shitty DLC that they put out at a really expensive amount of money just so that you get more
1201160	1204120	content to the game and it's just terrible.
1204120	1205520	It's only like 30 minutes.
1205520	1209320	Or, hey, we're teasing that there's a character that you love that we decided, hey, we're
1209320	1212480	gonna fuck you guys up and kill him in the very beginning of the game.
1212480	1214320	Oh, but he's gonna come back, but not really.
1214320	1218080	But we're gonna tell you that he's coming back so that you buy this $7 piece of crap.
1218080	1221760	Tiger Claw in our chatroom says, you don't need to play multiplayer to get the best ending.
1221760	1225720	There's an app you can download on your iPhone or iPad that will help increase the galactic
1225720	1226720	readiness rating.
1226720	1227720	All right.
1227720	1228720	I was not aware of that.
1228720	1229840	And Tiger Claw does say the app is free.
1229840	1230840	Okay.
1230840	1231840	That makes me feel a little better.
1231840	1235800	I didn't know that up front, so I apologize.
1235800	1240840	However, my point about the whole nickel and diming and you don't get to make your game
1240840	1245400	a free-to-play Facebook game and charge 60 bucks for it point still stands.
1245400	1252800	Like you're allowing people to buy a competitive edge when it leaves a very bad taste in my
1252800	1253800	mouth.
1253800	1254800	Yeah.
1254800	1257080	Defend Mass Effect all you want.
1257080	1263280	I still say it's a great game, great story, awesome characters, wonderful gameplay, but
1263280	1264480	this is a shitty choice.
1264480	1265480	All right.
1265480	1266720	I'm looking at this app now.
1266720	1269280	Take your galaxy with you wherever you go.
1269280	1270280	Okay.
1270280	1273640	You know, the galaxy is in Orion's ball.
1273640	1280080	A City Vampire also says technically you could play the multiplayer by yourself to up the
1280080	1281080	galactic readiness.
1281080	1282080	Yeah.
1282080	1285320	But I did two player, which is me and Shane yesterday.
1285320	1291040	And we survived a wave three and we were really excited that we got that far.
1291040	1292040	Yes.
1292040	1296040	So I misquoted that it's the galaxy is in Orion's belt.
1296040	1297640	It's been a while since I saw him in black.
1297640	1298640	All right.
1298640	1302000	So, so all that bitching aside, Mass Effect three is still going to be one of the year's
1302000	1303240	best games.
1303240	1306180	I just think I, I'm, I'm side IEA.
1306180	1307440	I'm looking at UEA.
1307440	1308840	This is a shitty choice.
1308840	1312580	If game designers continue to go down this path, this is what's going to cause the next
1312580	1317840	game crash watch this and the no use thing and everything.
1317840	1321560	All these other money grabs gaming companies are trying to do in this economy is going
1321560	1322560	to take it.
1322560	1323560	This is money grabbing light.
1323560	1324560	Okay.
1324560	1327160	This is nothing compared to some of the crap that they're pulling right now.
1327160	1330320	I mean, Skylanders, Skylanders.
1330320	1336120	I'm telling you right there, that right there is seriously the tiny pebble that is rolling
1336120	1337120	down the hill.
1337120	1341840	That's going to, you know, turn into this giant snowball that will kill the industry.
1341840	1346440	That right there, that one game, because it was successful because idiots bought these
1346440	1347960	stupid toys.
1347960	1351240	That is what's going to fucking ruin this industry and you think DLC is bad now.
1351240	1354040	Oh, you have not seen anything yet.
1354040	1356080	By the way, I downloaded the app.
1356080	1359600	And I want to point out, you did just say in chat, the app has restored your desire
1359600	1360600	to play it.
1360600	1363160	Just to make that clear for listeners, knowing that there is a free option makes you feel
1363160	1364160	a little better.
1364160	1369040	Well, and on top of that too, I mean, I just started, I finished my first month of my job
1369040	1371800	and I have two weeks left of school.
1371800	1375380	So really I've had no concentration.
1375380	1377560	What is this real life stuff I'm hearing?
1377560	1378560	Excuse me.
1378560	1379560	I'm just kidding.
1379560	1381440	Video games are how to escape all that.
1381440	1383440	Bitch please.
1383440	1389000	When the job that you work requires your brain and then you have to use your brain some more,
1389000	1394480	the brain does not have much juice left to think about multiplayer and, and shooting
1394480	1395480	things.
1395480	1398440	And I don't even ever want to play.
1398440	1399440	Wow.
1399440	1400440	So.
1400440	1401440	All right.
1401440	1402440	Anyhow.
1402440	1404360	Um, that's it for my gaming week.
1404360	1405360	Really massive victory.
1405360	1408160	Oh no, I guess I should give one other little shout out quick, quick one guys.
1408160	1409160	Quick one.
1409160	1410160	And then we can get into the news.
1410160	1411160	Um, I will say quickly.
1411160	1415200	I watched a friend of mine last night play silent Hill downpour, which is the new silent
1415200	1416200	Hill game.
1416200	1419200	I went to a friend's house to watch and play it.
1419200	1420200	It was all right.
1420200	1421560	Like the graphics were really good.
1421560	1422680	The graphics are really good.
1422680	1425180	There were some things about it that made me laugh.
1425180	1430140	Like in the very opening sequence, there's this guy you have to kill and like you stab
1430140	1433080	him with a knife in the, in his back literally.
1433080	1435440	And he's running around the room that you're in.
1435440	1439460	And the way that he's running is so hilariously bad.
1439460	1444600	You can't help but like face Palm and go, Oh God, Konami, what have you done?
1444600	1448680	Uh, there's a lot of, I mean, I, you can't judge the whole game based off that one like
1448680	1453600	silly part, you know, otherwise, and plus I didn't really spend quality time with it
1453600	1458520	and I wasn't the one playing, but look and ambience aside, it is, it does seem like there's
1458520	1459520	a lot, they got right.
1459520	1462780	Like there were some, Oh shit moments, like there's a part where he's walking across this
1462780	1467660	fallen tree that like, you know, he might fall at any minute and then he like a twig
1467660	1472200	snaps off the tree and goes plummeting down, you know, cheap ass scares like that, that
1472200	1475120	you come to love out of, you know, playing these scary video games.
1475120	1476840	There are some cool little things like that.
1476840	1480760	So I didn't play enough of the game to really tell you if it's worth it or not, but I will
1480760	1483000	tell you, my friend seems to be enjoying it.
1483000	1488640	You know, it's not silent Hill two or silent Hill three, but let's be real.
1488640	1493740	It, nothing ever will be shit silent Hill two and three that just came out last month
1493740	1496740	isn't silent Hill two and three anymore.
1496740	1501960	So if you can let that go, I think this is a pretty decent game from what I understand.
1501960	1502960	It actually did occur to me.
1502960	1507320	There was some other gaming that went on at my house, Dan playing through, um, Gradius
1507320	1508320	three.
1508320	1509320	Yeah.
1509320	1513840	And me failing miserably at our type, just saying.
1513840	1514840	Sorry to hear that.
1514840	1518240	Sorry to hear that just because I wanted to hear the level one music and then when I'm
1518240	1521720	done with level one, it's kind of like, I don't want to play anymore.
1521720	1522720	All right.
1522720	1526060	Uh, go to our chat room at vog network.com if you want to join us as we are live on this
1526060	1531920	Sunday evening as we will be every week from here on out at the vog network, vog network.com
1531920	1537080	Uh, looking through some comments in chat, zither says, I heard the silent Hill HD collection
1537080	1538080	sucks.
1538080	1539080	Yeah.
1539080	1540080	I heard that too.
1540080	1541080	Uh, it did suck.
1541080	1544520	Um, unfortunately like something about the, I mean, I haven't played it myself, but just
1544520	1546320	what I'm reading isn't good.
1546320	1551600	Apparently next gen consoles can't handle last gen fog.
1551600	1552600	That's ridiculous.
1552600	1553600	Downpour.
1553600	1556560	I watched played on a PS three and it had plenty of fog.
1556560	1561600	And here's the thing is if you can't render the fog, then why bother releasing the game?
1561600	1568240	It's like if you can't create, uh, an emulator or whatever to run the old code, then don't
1568240	1569480	do it.
1569480	1571240	Just don't release a broken game.
1571240	1574060	Uh, stand in our chat room asks, how was the music?
1574060	1578120	Because as you know, Akira Yomoka is no longer with Konami, so he has nothing to do with
1578120	1581360	these games now, which, you know, some say is, is the reason why they're, they're not
1581360	1582360	so good anymore.
1582360	1585740	Uh, the music was composed by, I think his name is Daniel Licht and he does the music
1585740	1586740	for Dexter.
1586740	1592160	Um, it, the, the parts that I heard again in my limited, uh, viewing was, um, decent
1592160	1593160	enough.
1593160	1601240	It was enough of a cop drama TV show mixed with some of the little themes, like the little,
1601240	1604000	that little thing that you hear in the beginning, a little mandolin or whatever.
1604000	1607120	Like it's, it's enough of those kind of mixed together as the elements.
1607120	1611360	But again, if you're going to go into the game going, the music, I just know nothing
1611360	1612800	is going to compare to Akira Yomoka.
1612800	1614520	This game is never going to compare to Akira Yomoka.
1614520	1618440	If you're not willing to take those blinders off and go, okay, it's a new game.
1618440	1619920	Let's just deal with what it is.
1619920	1622600	I think you're just going to set yourself up for disappointment.
1622600	1625720	So just kind of want to throw that out there.
1625720	1631040	Uh, Nietzsche in our chat room says, is the original Silent Hill still playable or is
1631040	1632760	it painful to play through?
1632760	1634760	Got a free copy through PlayStation Plus.
1634760	1637160	Yeah, don't forget it is, is free on PlayStation Plus.
1637160	1638560	I need to grab it myself.
1638560	1641360	Um, that is a direct port of the PlayStation one game.
1641360	1644340	So as I understand, everything should be fine.
1644340	1649400	It's not going to be up rezzed or any of that stuff besides the very, very, very basic like
1649400	1653520	texture smoothing and some of the things that the PlayStation three will do to PS one classics.
1653520	1657520	Um, otherwise you're getting a pretty legitimate experience as long as you're willing to play
1657520	1662260	a game with 1997 graphics, then you'll be all right.
1662260	1663360	You know, just keep that in mind.
1663360	1666160	It was the games getting to be almost 15 years old.
1666160	1669640	So all right, um, that's it with our gaming weeks.
1669640	1672680	Let's move on into some housekeeping.

1703680	1705640	Please help spread the word about the new network.
1705640	1706720	We so can't wait.
1706720	1712520	And I again really want to thank the folks at geek-life.com for all the work they did
1712520	1714520	in promoting today's launch.
1714520	1717300	Go visit their website and click on ads.
1717300	1718480	It would go a long way.
1718480	1719480	Thank you much.
1719480	1720520	All right, let's move on.
1720520	1722520	Let's um, get into some gaming news this week.
1722520	1723520	Loki start off.
1723520	1732680	So Sony is not one to be outdone by Nintendo in the form of, you know, uh, mascot character
1732680	1734720	battle royale deathmatch or whatever.
1734720	1739720	Um, so now they have the PlayStation all stars battle royale, which is coming to the PlayStation
1739720	1740720	three.
1740720	1742880	Uh, this year, I wish it was coming together.
1742880	1744080	That'd be kind of cool.
1744080	1749240	But um, it's being developed by super bot and it features characters from all sorts
1749240	1754960	of different places and franchises, new and old, including, um, Parappa the rapper was
1754960	1755960	in there.
1755960	1756960	That was kind of cool.
1756960	1761260	Um, Kratos, he did study Kung Fu punch.
1761260	1764120	It's all in the mind and they actually took that into account.
1764120	1766440	So he does have some Kung Fu moves that he uses.
1766440	1771160	So well, he damn well better actually Parappa's lethal move is he gives you the most bitch
1771160	1774440	and paper cut you've ever had in your life.
1774440	1775440	That's what he does.
1775440	1782760	Uh, but of course, you know, the Sly Cooper is in there, um, fat princess, um, and also,
1782760	1787800	you know, some other characters that are mentioning that, you know, obviously Cole from Infamous
1787800	1791060	is probably going to be in there and they're going to have some characters from resistance
1791060	1793560	and all sorts of different things.
1793560	1799200	Um, and it looks extremely like, you know, I'm trying to think of other big Sony products
1799200	1803360	so they could bring in this game, obviously, uh, absolute, uh, the cart, little cart dudes
1803360	1804560	from ModNation racers.
1804560	1805560	Um, maybe.
1805560	1806560	I don't know.
1806560	1807760	I don't think about the cast of the tester.
1807760	1811520	Should we call Oscar to see if they did any sweet tooth was going to be in there.
1811520	1816320	Um, now one of the things I did like about, um, the game that they kind of showed in the
1816320	1821200	trailers since this whole thing is kind of like this matte mashup thing they have like
1821200	1825640	in the background, kind of like two different worlds clashing at the same time.
1825640	1830280	So like for example, they'll have, um, uh, it was actually really cool.
1830280	1831760	They had, I think one of the demons.
1831760	1838440	I want Hades from, um, God of war was actually attacking, um, the Pat upon.
1838440	1839520	So that was kind of cool.
1839520	1841020	They had that kind of going on there.
1841020	1847240	There was one I saw, it was little big planets world kind of, um, crossed with, uh, what
1847240	1852640	the fuck is their dam, uh, buzz, the, the buzz game, like the quiz show thing.
1852640	1853640	Oh yeah.
1853640	1854640	Buzz.
1854640	1855640	Yeah.
1855640	1856640	So a host dude.
1856640	1857640	Yeah.
1857640	1859480	So I'm wondering if he's a character or something, but, uh, it was interesting, but the gameplay
1859480	1862400	itself looks exactly like smash brothers.
1862400	1863400	Exactly like smash brothers.
1863400	1868560	Have the, have the creators addressed that gigantic pink elephant in the room that, Hey,
1868560	1870600	your game looks really damn familiar.
1870600	1873360	I think I've seen this somewhere before.
1873360	1874360	No.
1874360	1879960	Um, it doesn't seem like they have, I mean, it's going to play a little bit different,
1879960	1881800	but damn, does it look like smash brothers?
1881800	1883320	Well, here, here's the question.
1883320	1889440	I mean, is it okay what they're doing because you know, I kind of go, well, they're, they're
1889440	1894120	there's several different basketball games that come out and there's all these dance
1894120	1895120	games.
1895120	1896120	It's just like fighting games.
1896120	1899400	I mean, all the fighting games, I mean, are pretty similar, right?
1899400	1904440	So there's, I think enough different with it that it'll be, you know, its own thing,
1904440	1906200	but I don't know.
1906200	1909080	It's just, it, it obviously it's getting one of the things that people are gonna think
1909080	1910960	of him as like, wow, this really looks like smashers.
1910960	1912280	No, that could be good or bad.
1912280	1913280	I don't know.
1913280	1918720	So did people, you know, call out smash brothers for being like, you know, for having the four
1918720	1920200	player thing like power stone.
1920200	1923840	I mean, even the power stone was, you know, full layout.
1923840	1930640	It was, you know, and not the, the semi 2d, um, zither in the chat room says Nintendo
1930640	1936480	should Sue, but Ross TLUT in our chat room at vognetwork.com follows that up with well,
1936480	1942020	but hold on because you know, um, smash brothers wasn't really the first game to do it either.
1942020	1947800	And links to a game called the out foxies, which I don't remember this game at all, but
1947800	1951720	certainly, you know, certainly there's probably older games in the past that were similar.
1951720	1954960	I remember playing one on the DS that was very similar.
1954960	1958960	I guess that would be after smash brothers in the 64 that was a, the top Trump's or not
1958960	1959960	top Trump's.
1959960	1965580	It's a, the, it was all the, um, it was like, yeah, it was like, uh, yeah, like snake from
1965580	1969480	metal gear was in it and all this, I played it at a comic convention once there was a
1969480	1970480	game on the DS.
1970480	1974580	It was total like, just like it and it, it existed and I'm looking at, it was a shonen
1974580	1975580	jump game.
1975580	1976580	That's what it was.
1976580	1977840	It was something really boring.
1977840	1979400	Uh, no Trump's is a card game.
1979400	1981560	I understand that, but it was shown in jump.
1981560	1987720	Uh, it was their game that they had, uh, Bob coffee in our term says smash for N 64 came
1987720	1989080	out before power stone.
1989080	1990640	If I recall, that is true.
1990640	1991640	That is true.
1991640	1996120	Jump and power, power stone actually was full on 3d rotational, everything.
1996120	1999640	Uh, several folks in our chat room, all jumping in there, jump all stars is the game I'm trying
1999640	2000640	to think of.
2000640	2001640	Yeah.
2001640	2002640	So you know, this type of thing.
2002640	2004800	And there was the Ninja turtles game on game cube.
2004800	2010160	There's been some other kind of inspired, heavily inspired, shall we say by smash brothers?
2010160	2016640	I got to say as much as I kind of chuckle at this game being, you know, heavily inspired,
2016640	2019280	shall we say about what Nintendo's got going on?
2019280	2020660	I want to play it.
2020660	2022240	It looks pretty cool.
2022240	2028080	I love the fact that it'll be HD and it's going to get online, right?
2028080	2029080	That's one place.
2029080	2034360	I mean, I guess smash brothers, you know, melee did as well as it could with the online,
2034360	2037800	but I'm, I'm thinking that this has got to be coming out for the, uh, the Vita.
2037800	2043040	I mean, it would be, I would think it would be a mistake not to put it on the Vita, especially
2043040	2047680	it's, it's something, although, although, um, maybe the reason it's not coming on the
2047680	2051280	Vita is because they really have issues with doing network play.
2051280	2056640	You know, it's like, well, well you can do it via wifi or you can do this asynchronous
2056640	2058000	multiplayer bullshit.
2058000	2061000	Doesn't street fighter cross Tekken, isn't that going to be PS3 and Vita?
2061000	2067240	Like you can, well, it is going to be, yeah, but I mean, you know, Capcom's had more experience
2067240	2069240	working on the PlayStation three.
2069240	2072520	That's why they couldn't, you know, add certain features to the Xbox version.
2072520	2075760	Shadow next gen in our chat says, sky, this is a PS3 game.
2075760	2078920	There's no guarantee that online will be done right.
2078920	2083400	That may be true, but I'm sorry I give Sony more credit than I give Nintendo when it comes
2083400	2084400	to doing online, right?
2084400	2087960	Yeah, I would trust them with online better than granted.
2087960	2090960	Smash Brothers Melee probably did a hell of a lot better than any other Nintendo game
2090960	2095600	before it, as far as online goes, but keep in mind, Nintendo had that whole friend code
2095600	2099600	garbage you had to work with, you know, so that didn't make anything fun.
2099600	2102940	So, um, all right.
2102940	2106960	So anyhow, again, if you want to join our chat room, vog network.com, meanwhile, let's
2106960	2108400	go to some other gaming news.
2108400	2114600	Uh, this is a little bit of a surprise or, and it's not because it's always about patents.
2114600	2119200	You know, patent, I get the sense that patent laws in this country are, are going to be
2119200	2123520	headed somewhere different soon, especially you hear, there's just so much in the news
2123520	2124520	about like what?
2124520	2126240	Twitter was a Twitter.
2126240	2130900	So one of them acquired all these patents and said that they're only using them defensively.
2130900	2133960	They don't plan to use ever like sue for patent or whatever.
2133960	2138920	And then you have Facebook suing Yahoo and Yahoo suing Facebook and all this stuff over
2138920	2139920	patents.
2139920	2144400	I mean the, the money that's getting sucked away into all this is just amazing.
2144400	2148320	And here we have another result of the whole patent warfare.
2148320	2154680	The Xbox 360 has been found infringing on four patents that were owned by Motorola.
2154680	2160520	Uh, according to the website, the verge, the patents that were in question deal with the
2160520	2166960	video codec, the H two 64, um, that is also going on with some other legal proceedings
2166960	2169280	with Microsoft and Motorola right now.
2169280	2172060	The other two are about wifi technology.
2172060	2176960	There's also a fifth patent about communication between the Xbox and its accessories.
2176960	2182200	However, one of the wifi patents was found not infringed and one claim regarding one
2182200	2187960	of the video patents was invalid, but some were found to be valid.
2187960	2194560	So Microsoft is seeking to force a Motorola to license its standard patents under more
2194560	2200400	fair and reasonable terms, but this original ruling by the judge is a bit of a blow on
2200400	2202040	Microsoft's efforts.
2202040	2207160	However, as most things in the legal system appeal, appeal, appeal, and the appeal step
2207160	2208160	is a panel of six judges.
2208160	2212600	I want to say that they're also suing, I want to say that they're suing Apple too.
2212600	2217560	It, um, it was some other big company, um, that Motorola was going after.
2217560	2224680	I want to say, I think it was Apple when Zethur and Motorola used to make Apple's processors.
2224680	2227280	All the tech companies have helped each other and then stab each other in the back.
2227280	2228280	It's it's, it's crazy.
2228280	2231120	Zethur in her terms is patent trolling.
2231120	2236240	Basically I reserve the term patent troll for a company that exists to do nothing but
2236240	2237240	this.
2237240	2243440	Um, and, but you're talking Motorola and Microsoft, you know, they're both really big companies.
2243440	2244880	Motorola makes lots of phones.
2244880	2247360	I don't know if I call them a patent troll.
2247360	2249340	This is just patent warfare.
2249340	2254800	This is very similar to what you see going on with Yahoo and Facebook.
2254800	2258000	You know, Yahoo hasn't been doing so well lately because you know, back in the early
2258000	2260920	days of the web, Yahoo was kind of like the king of search engines.
2260920	2265240	It was a big directory everybody used and uh, you know, they, they, they've survived.
2265240	2266240	They kept up with water.
2266240	2269680	And it is Apple by the way, they've tried to become a bit of a portal.
2269680	2274160	They have their Yahoo mail, but they haven't really been able to like break through like,
2274160	2276440	you know, Google kind of stomped on it and so forth.
2276440	2278080	I still use Yahoo here and there.
2278080	2282480	They're a good portal, but they're struggling and they've had to lay a lot of people off.
2282480	2283680	So what did Yahoo do?
2283680	2288760	They sued Facebook over 10 patents that Yahoo had and a lot of it tied into, I think the
2288760	2293560	my Yahoo that they tried to develop that has a lot of aggregate feed type stuff that Facebook
2293560	2295880	also does to kind of put it in a nutshell.
2295880	2298360	Um, so what did Facebook do in return?
2298360	2301040	Sued Yahoo right back over other patents.
2301040	2302820	That's just patent warfare.
2302820	2306760	And that is, I don't want to say it's patent trolling, but it's clear that Yahoo struggling
2306760	2311920	and this is something that they're doing to try and kind of get themselves back up a little
2311920	2312920	bit.
2312920	2314760	Or maybe just try to stay relevant.
2314760	2315760	In a way maybe.
2315760	2322960	Well, um, I found the, the other one and actually it is Apple, um, that's for a patent for noise
2322960	2327200	elimination and other interference during voice and data transmission.
2327200	2332480	So now does this mean the Xbox 360 is going to suddenly stop being sold?
2332480	2333960	I kind of doubt that.
2333960	2338360	Um, it's gone a little far this at this point, but could Microsoft end up having to pay huge
2338360	2340120	amounts of money to Motorola?
2340120	2344120	Could they have to, you know, agree to some pretty hefty terms for the technology?
2344120	2345840	Yeah, it's possible.
2345840	2350400	Could they perhaps not put rumble in their next console because it's not really that
2350400	2351400	important anyways.
2351400	2353560	It has nothing to do with the fact that they infringed on the patent.
2353560	2354560	Oh, remember all that?
2354560	2355680	Yeah, that's a great comparison.
2355680	2356680	Remember that?
2356680	2358680	That's why you didn't have rumble in the original PlayStation 3.
2358680	2360840	No, it wasn't because they were infringing on patents.
2360840	2363880	It's because it wasn't important until they decided to put it in there.
2363880	2364880	Sure, sure.
2364880	2365880	Whatever.
2365880	2366880	That's exactly what it is.
2366880	2368960	Not the fact that they got sued over the PlayStation 2 controllers.
2368960	2371360	No, it was just, it wasn't important right then.
2371360	2373680	It just, it became important later.
2373680	2375560	Sixaxis was the future of gaming.
2375560	2379840	What was the last game that used Sixaxis?
2379840	2381640	Sixaxis was a pain in the ass.
2381640	2386560	I know the last thing that I played that included it was Marvel Ultimate Alliance.
2386560	2387560	I think that was it.
2387560	2388560	That game's a few years old.
2388560	2392240	I think there's still some games that use it, but man, it's not something that they're
2392240	2393240	like, hey!
2393240	2396640	Little Big Planet is one of the last ones I can think of that uses it.
2396640	2399080	Um, yeah.
2399080	2400080	Sixaxis.
2400080	2403240	You can use it as a steering wheel, right?
2403240	2405480	Yeah, it works, works great too.
2405480	2406480	Awesome.
2406480	2408200	Actually, that's why I still have a negcon.
2408200	2410120	I will say, actually, I thought of it.
2410120	2415800	I will, there is a Sixaxis game that was pretty bitchin', Flower.
2415800	2419160	That's like the only Sixaxis game I can sit here and say I truly enjoyed it.
2419160	2424480	I can use it to slightly adjust the camera in Journey.
2424480	2427640	Moving on with more news.
2427640	2431160	How about something that doesn't have to do with a really crappy controller?
2431160	2432160	How about it?
2432160	2435080	I got some Call of Duty.
2435080	2436080	How about it?
2436080	2437080	Bang, bang, bang.
2437080	2441880	Well, um, the release date for Call of Duty Black Ops 2 has been leaked.
2441880	2444440	Which I don't know if it was on purpose or not.
2444440	2448920	I love when they say leaked, but you don't really know.
2448920	2449920	Anyway.
2449920	2457100	Um, so there was an image of the PS3 and Xbox 360 pre-order cards for Target.
2457100	2459600	And it was posted by IGN earlier.
2459600	2463680	It says it's gonna be on November 13th.
2463680	2466560	So we have a shake of the head.
2466560	2467560	Loki?
2467560	2468560	I think they're guessing.
2468560	2470320	Nothing's been announced.
2470320	2473020	They're seriously guessing because I don't even think the game's gonna be called Black
2473020	2474720	Ops 2 to be honest.
2474720	2480680	Um, because they've registered trademarks for Call of Duty Eclipse.
2480680	2485560	And they're guessing because already in blogs, like Kotaku and some other places, they've
2485560	2490600	speculated that it's gonna be on the 13th because there happens to be a full lunar eclipse
2490600	2494720	or solar eclipse actually on that date.
2494720	2497160	Which also happens to fall on a Tuesday during November.
2497160	2501920	There's a fucking election, presidential election happening the same day as the Halo release
2501920	2502920	date.
2502920	2503920	Well, to continue.
2503920	2504920	Solar eclipses don't matter.
2504920	2509640	There was indication first of a Black Ops sequel with an Amazon France listing that
2509640	2510640	got pulled.
2510640	2515680	Um, but there's supposed to be actual news coming out on this on May 1st.
2515680	2520560	And the other reason I call bullshit on this too is because they, Call of Duty, they're
2520560	2528780	using like, was it, like the Roman numerals for Black Ops 2 when, you know, it's most
2528780	2534440	likely they normally just use like actual, you know, numbers for their titles.
2534440	2536000	I just don't think it's gonna be Black Ops.
2536000	2537800	I think that they're just guessing.
2537800	2544200	And what's it really gonna hurt if they have, you know, um, some sort of, you know, pre-order
2544200	2547040	card or whatever to get people excited about a new Call of Duty game?
2547040	2551080	I mean, so what, if it ends up being something else, they'll just have to reprint cards.
2551080	2554100	But I mean, we're gonna find out soon enough.
2554100	2555100	It's just not.
2555100	2559160	If they've got a card dated with it though, and this is just, if you think about the cost
2559160	2563200	of printing and on a national scale.
2563200	2564200	But I mean, this isn't.
2564200	2565200	Wait, wait a minute.
2565200	2566200	Wait a minute.
2566200	2570800	If a target would just put a release date in their system and then put these fake things
2570800	2573080	on the shelves to entice people to pre-order.
2573080	2576560	I've never heard of that done before in the gaming retail industry.
2576560	2581040	And it's not like that big major changes have not been wrong, you know, in printed marking
2581040	2582040	material.
2582040	2583040	Like for example.
2583040	2584040	It doesn't really matter.
2584040	2588120	According to Best Buy, you know, shit Diablo 3 should have been out months ago.
2588120	2589120	I mean.
2589120	2590120	Wait a minute.
2590120	2592240	That was one Best Buy in like Wisconsin or something.
2592240	2596240	And the whole thing, it doesn't really matter because they're making announcement on it
2596240	2598080	in three days.
2598080	2600280	So again, does it matter?
2600280	2601280	No.
2601280	2602280	It's, but it's all about firsties.
2602280	2604520	It's all about who did it first, who called it first.
2604520	2606960	And because, you know, that's why we have the whole patent wars.
2606960	2610040	And that's a pile of who gives a shit.
2610040	2611040	Yeah.
2611040	2618400	That's so that all these websites can go exclusive, exclusive release date, at least exclusive
2618400	2622400	pictures of the exclusive, exclusiving exclusive that we have.
2622400	2624880	You know what an actual exclusive is?
2624880	2632020	Is if the company went to, Hey, Hey, IGN, we want you to have the date officially from
2632020	2633400	us.
2633400	2634840	That's an exclusive.
2634840	2638400	Getting it off of a, you know, a card from a target.
2638400	2641840	You mean like certain radio entrepreneurs may have gone to a geeky website to give them
2641840	2643360	the exclusive on what was happening?
2643360	2644360	Exactly.
2644360	2648320	When they come to you and say, we want you to do it first because you've been good
2648320	2649440	to us.
2649440	2656280	But if I use the word exclusive as much as exclusively possible in my article, then I'll
2656280	2666040	get more hits and I'll get to go to E3 because that's what this industry has turned into.
2666040	2671480	Exclusive Jamie Shuttermouth for the first time here on Orange Lounge Radio.
2671480	2673200	That's a Rob Roberts exclusive.
2673200	2676240	Actions speak louder than words and none of you can see this action.
2676240	2677520	And I'm getting the finger.
2677520	2679480	I mean, yeah, it's a good guess.
2679480	2684840	I mean, obviously they're not going to launch the same day as Halo and it's typically the
2684840	2691440	second second Tuesday of November that they normally launch Call of Duty.
2691440	2696800	So I mean, it's a good guess and they could be right.
2696800	2698560	I was not purring.
2698560	2703200	I mean, it's only like what, you know, one in four shot of being correct.
2703200	2708360	So yeah, and actually one in two because I mean it's going to be in the beginning of
2708360	2709360	the month.
2709360	2713160	They might have to recall all those cards or in the great retail big box way.
2713160	2714160	Get a bunch.
2714160	2716320	Get a big black marker.
2716320	2717320	Get the new guy.
2717320	2718320	Hey, new guy.
2718320	2723200	Take this giant stack of 500 cards and you take this Sharpie and everywhere you see a
2723200	2727200	13 you're going to write a 20.
2727200	2728200	You think you can do that?
2728200	2729940	When do I get my break?
2729940	2732720	That's not how it works.
2732720	2737080	You didn't have to pay that guy more to be honest for the time that would take him to
2737080	2738080	do all that.
2738080	2741640	Then it would just be to print up 50,000 new cards.
2741640	2743800	Can I, can I go on a tangent?
2743800	2745800	I want a vog tangent.
2745800	2748920	I want our first vog tangent.
2748920	2750440	We already had one of those, Rob.
2750440	2751440	I went grocery.
2751440	2752440	It was okra.
2752440	2754640	I went grocery shopping with Alan yesterday.
2754640	2756400	We went to the grocery store.
2756400	2757780	I know, right?
2757780	2758960	I know, right?
2758960	2759960	So we went to the grocery store.
2759960	2760960	Exclusive.
2760960	2770280	And we bought probably like, I don't know, $120 worth of groceries, but thanks to couponing
2770280	2772960	I got it down to 115.
2772960	2773960	But anyway.
2773960	2774960	How very Dutch of you.
2774960	2780360	The point is, well it is in my heritage, but anyway, we get the cart, you know how you
2780360	2784080	take the cart up to the little thing and you put everything up on the conveyor belt, right?
2784080	2789900	One of the employees was standing there waiting for us to put the cart and they actually took
2789900	2792600	everything out of the cart and put it on the conveyor belt.
2792600	2795240	And I was thinking, they don't ever do that for you.
2795240	2799580	You always, why are the employees, they have one person bagging, they have one at the register,
2799580	2803120	and now this chick is just loading the groceries on the conveyor belt for me.
2803120	2807340	I mean, not that I'm going to complain, but it does kind of make me go, gosh, I feel really
2807340	2808340	fucking lazy.
2808340	2811880	And I'm like, is everybody else in the grocery store just watching this poor grocery clerk
2811880	2812880	like do this for me?
2812880	2817000	And like, if I was in a wheelchair or had a cast on or something, I could understand
2817000	2818000	why they do that.
2818000	2826000	But Alan and I are both perfectly healthy individuals, you know, Rob and Alan are healthy.
2826000	2827000	Yet she was doing it.
2827000	2831160	So I was like, um, well, thank you for loading the groceries on the conveyor belt.
2831160	2833400	What so whatever do we owe this?
2833400	2834520	Like I don't usually see us.
2834520	2838480	And she said, well, we're really overstaffed right now.
2838480	2841040	We have a lot of new people that just started today.
2841040	2842480	So we have so many people.
2842480	2844280	She's like, I was just, I was just here.
2844280	2846440	I needed something to do.
2846440	2850440	And she's like, I spent all morning in the produce department just arranging things.
2850440	2855840	And I'm thinking to myself inappropriately, I'm thinking to myself, apples and bananas.
2855840	2859920	As much as I appreciate that she has a job, she has good employment.
2859920	2862600	So that offers union.
2862600	2864280	See if she wants to go home.
2864280	2865280	She's union.
2865280	2866280	What is that?
2866280	2867440	Is that a union thing?
2867440	2869360	I didn't even think of that, but you're probably right.
2869360	2870360	I worked.
2870360	2873720	Keep in mind, I worked for a grocery store for all of three freaking days and I quit
2873720	2877720	after the old man tried to be a bitch to me and I told him he couldn't buy his beer.
2877720	2883560	I haven't said that story on the air, have I, but I know that like you had, you were,
2883560	2887180	you got guaranteed certain number of hours and you got guaranteed this.
2887180	2893040	And like you, if you were scheduled to work, you had to work and this crap, um, a sitting
2893040	2896240	vampire in chat says that's like someone pumping your gas.
2896240	2897240	It did.
2897240	2898240	It did.
2898240	2899240	Oregon.
2899240	2900240	It did feel very Jersey or Oregon.
2900240	2901240	Take your pick.
2901240	2905400	Um, I have to tell you one thing, and this just goes from my childhood and visiting my
2905400	2911680	granny in Dothan, Alabama, that we would go to the Piggly Wiggly.
2911680	2914960	I know the best name for a grocery store ever.
2914960	2918000	And I'm going to go get pork at the Piggly Wiggly.
2918000	2924640	And they had, um, these type of conveyor belts that your, um, the back end of your, uh, buggy
2924640	2930080	would unlatch and it would push right up to the belt and then the cashier would unload
2930080	2931080	for you.
2931080	2932080	They used to have those here too.
2932080	2936160	They were those kind of tall, flat, flatter type of buggies.
2936160	2939240	Some of the old railies here still had that where you just push, you don't even have a
2939240	2940240	conveyor belt.
2940240	2942880	You push the cart right up to the counter and then they open the front of it and just
2942880	2944600	pull everything off of it and go over the standard.
2944600	2945600	Which I think is great.
2945600	2946600	Yeah, I do too.
2946600	2953160	I mean, but now it's, you know, I also hate self service.
2953160	2958520	Uh, and then, well yeah, I was going to say, uh, Ross Deal UT in our VOG chat room says
2958520	2961160	here in Florida, we got Winn Dixie's with the self checkout counters.
2961160	2962160	Yeah, we have that too.
2962160	2967320	But when you're buying like $120 worth of groceries, I don't want to use the self.
2967320	2968960	Those things are a pain in the ass.
2968960	2971280	Old school Winn Dixie's by the way, had the old style thing too.
2971280	2975560	The self checkouts are great for like when, you know, you need just a pint of ice cream
2975560	2981900	and Doritos, but like when you're buying legit groceries for the week with produce and everything,
2981900	2985680	like you don't, I know I would not use the self checkout, it would take forever.
2985680	2987480	I have an expert do it.
2987480	2988480	Anyhow.
2988480	2989480	Wow.
2989480	2992480	Everyone's talking about what their grocery stores are.
2992480	2993480	I know.
2993480	2996440	So this is, this is the most the chat was talked about all night.
2996440	2998320	Perhaps we should become a grocery store podcast.
2998320	3002480	Uh, Nietzsche in our chat says here in Kansas, your groceries are always bagged and sometimes
3002480	3003520	carried to your vehicle.
3003520	3004520	No questions asked.
3004520	3005960	Raley's here does that.
3005960	3009240	Well, they always ask, but I'm always like, no, no, no, no, but the thing is they're required
3009240	3010240	to do it.
3010240	3011240	It's part of their job.
3011240	3012240	Really?
3012240	3013240	Yeah, it is.
3013240	3014240	So Dan and I have them do it.
3014240	3015800	Again, if I'm buying ice cream and Doritos, I don't want to help out.
3015800	3017760	If you're buying two things, that's one thing.
3017760	3021560	But like if you're, if you're getting like all your groceries for the week or for the
3021560	3024520	month or whatever, then it's, you know, it's kind of nice.
3024520	3025520	It's part of their job.
3025520	3027280	It's what they're supposed to do.
3027280	3032320	And it, you know, honestly, we asked one of them flat out is like, do you really mind
3032320	3033320	doing this?
3033320	3035080	I like, I like getting out and getting some air.
3035080	3037880	Hey, I want all those grapes individually bagged.
3037880	3042960	I need you to go through this bag of M&Ms and pick out the green ones.
3042960	3047920	Now, um, DJ Morpheus in chat is saying that's the Rob Roberts diet, ice cream and Doritos.
3047920	3049240	I think that's your family crest.
3049240	3054280	It's a big bag of Doritos with big, might well be pulps of ice cream coming out of the
3054280	3063760	top of it and like, um, hello kitty over the bag of Doritos and, uh, the, uh, word, a penis
3063760	3064760	or something.
3064760	3066400	I don't know.
3066400	3074280	Well, so, uh, in great, uh, internet fashion, we have apparently dropped this for the podcast
3074280	3075280	listeners.
3075280	3076520	We're trying to reconnect to the feed right now.
3076520	3078640	I hope this isn't a repeat of what happened last week.
3078640	3081880	That would be most unfortunate, but I don't think Comcast does anything.
3081880	3084000	It is trying to reconnect right now and there it is.
3084000	3085000	It reconnected.
3085000	3087760	Apparently I just watched the bandwidth guys.
3087760	3090440	If you have anything else going on, I just have to get that out there.
3090440	3093080	I know, but these things happen.
3093080	3095360	So yeah, I agree with game guru.
3095360	3097400	If I get so popular, everyone is crashing.
3097400	3098640	We'll just go with that.
3098640	3099640	You guys are just crashing.
3099640	3100640	Grocery lounge radio.
3100640	3101640	All right.
3101640	3102640	Anyhow.
3102640	3103640	Yeah.
3103640	3104640	You are the general manager.
3104640	3105640	All right.
3105640	3106640	Can we move on with more news?
3106640	3107640	I don't know how I got on that tangent.
3107640	3109120	I don't even know what that had to do with anything.
3109120	3112560	Oh, because you were talking about the guy with the pen who would get paid too much to
3112560	3113560	do that.
3113560	3114960	And I'm like, they pay people to do crazy stuff.
3114960	3121400	Like the chick who put my stuff on the conveyor belt, like I like mass effect.
3121400	3123600	It's a good game.
3123600	3127800	I have to, I have to do a trolling dedicated to dark Tetsuya.
3127800	3128800	If I may.
3128800	3129800	Yeah.
3129800	3139000	I do not torrent porn or torrent anything so goddamn slow.
3139000	3142240	Why would I turn anything when there's no, I'm going to torrent that breadstick and go
3142240	3143240	right ahead.
3143240	3145120	You're going to torrent me half of it.
3145120	3149000	And I don't torrent hentai or porn, at least not here.
3149000	3150000	I mean, shit.
3150000	3152200	This connection is too damn slow for that.
3152200	3155640	Um, anyways, uh, so let's talk a little bit about Woodstock.
3155640	3162240	No, I'm not talking about the, the gathering of musicians and sweaty people.
3162240	3168880	I'm talking about Microsoft's brand new music service for the Xbox 360.
3168880	3170840	Whoopty shit.
3170840	3175400	Um, I guess because Zune maybe is not taking off too well.
3175400	3180200	But um, I, oh, it's actually a relaunch and rebranding of the Zune music service.
3180200	3182280	Oh, well then I'm really not interested now.
3182280	3184920	Um, but anyways, they're dubbing it Woodstock.
3184920	3188960	It's supposed to be coming out on multiple platforms, including, you know, the Xbox 360,
3188960	3191480	Windows 8, iOS and Android devices.
3191480	3195960	Um, they're also saying that of course it's going to launch, um, it's not going to launch
3195960	3199080	till the fall with, you know, the Windows 8 launch.
3199080	3204440	Um, but it's going to be similar to like Spotify and they're going to have some sort of Facebook
3204440	3208720	integration as well where you can share your playlists and that kind of stuff.
3208720	3212760	And you can buy bottled water for $7.
3212760	3213760	Come on.
3213760	3214760	There's a, it's a Starbucks.
3214760	3216640	There's a Woodstock 94 joke in there.
3216640	3217640	Come on people.
3217640	3219640	Oh Rob.
3219640	3223120	The thing about Woodstock, it's kind of funny that they're taking that name because everything
3223120	3226200	like recent Woodstock hasn't been that great.
3226200	3231020	Like there was some really bad things that happened at those Woodstock revival festivals
3231020	3232240	or whatever in the nineties.
3232240	3235480	Like I'm talking things happening in those mosh pits and stuff that really should not
3235480	3238360	be happening anywhere period ever.
3238360	3242060	And you know how much all of the people at the original Woodstock got paid like oodles
3242060	3244640	and oodles and oodles to freaking be there.
3244640	3248840	And they like underestimated the number of people that would come and there was no toiletries
3248840	3251400	and people died and babies were born.
3251400	3254280	But I, the Woodstock I was thinking of was a cute little yellow bird that hangs out with
3254280	3255280	Snoopy.
3255280	3261200	I just, all right, so they're going to have a music service.
3261200	3264360	I hope it's free because otherwise I'm not going to be interested in it.
3264360	3266800	Let's talk about this other half of it then.
3266800	3272560	But why is Microsoft relaunching this again when they've really tried that zoom thing
3272560	3278120	and it just like, you know, because now they're trying to be the entertainment hub.
3278120	3283840	They want the Xbox 360 or even whatever the next console is to be this entertainment hub.
3283840	3287760	They're trying to get away from just being a games console they want.
3287760	3289600	It's a kind of replace like your set top box.
3289600	3294480	You put it in, you know, your living room with your TV and you're watching movies on
3294480	3295480	there.
3295480	3296480	You're playing games on there.
3296480	3300320	Everybody's in front of it with connect your, you know, listening to music.
3300320	3303480	They want it to be integrated with your life basically.
3303480	3305520	Um, and that's what they're trying to do with this.
3305520	3306520	They're adding music to it.
3306520	3308240	I agree with infinite in the chat room.
3308240	3310360	Wayne stock was much safer.
3310360	3311360	That's true.
3311360	3315280	If they call this Wayne stock, I would, uh, I would be kidding and give my right arm.
3315280	3318680	Yes, no right eye.
3318680	3320320	That was it.
3320320	3325120	All right, let's move on with some more news.
3325120	3327000	And this one has to do with Skyrim.
3327000	3330360	Hey, and it has nothing to do with arrows and body parts.
3330360	3331360	I swear.
3331360	3336440	This has to do with a Skyrim expansion pack, maybe question mark.
3336440	3340840	Apparently in the latest Skyrim patch, there are several references to what's called snow
3340840	3345520	elves, including a snow elf Prince who has some dialogue.
3345520	3350960	Uh, there's also files talking about crossbows, a whole folder called DLC01.
3350960	3352320	Hmm.
3352320	3353720	What could that be about?
3353720	3357840	So apparently this is information about the first DLC pack for Skyrim.
3357840	3359360	We don't know a whole lot else about it.
3359360	3362680	Although there's certainly that part of me that says, I'm going to buy it.
3362680	3366360	Well that, and gee, this, this took a little while for this to come out.
3366360	3368200	You too can take an X to the elbow.
3368200	3371560	Good things come to those who wait, usually.
3371560	3377840	I have more faith in Bethesda and DLC versus any other company on the face of the earth.
3377840	3384520	Um, just because it seems like their content is very, you know, thoroughly rich and full
3384520	3390360	of, you know, actual new things and not stuff that was on the disc.
3390360	3392160	Plus crossbows are pretty awesome.
3392160	3393160	Crossbows are pretty awesome.
3393160	3395520	Autocrossbows are even better.
3395520	3398400	One of these days I'll stop playing Mass Effect long enough to go back and play these other
3398400	3400080	games I've missed like Skyrim and stuff.
3400080	3401800	But you know the problem with crossbows is...
3401800	3405120	And run a certain somebody through a couple of dungeons on WoW.
3405120	3406120	Maybe.
3406120	3408600	Maybe reload.
3408600	3409600	It's a Game of Thrones run.
3409600	3411600	What if it's like an autocrossbow?
3411600	3415280	Gee, that'd be awesome.
3415280	3417200	So Final Fantasy 6-ish.
3417200	3420720	Moving on, Dark Sakura.
3420720	3423320	How about some Vita crap?
3423320	3427960	Um, because it is actually kind of performing like crap.
3427960	3429240	In Europe anyway.
3429240	3436160	Um, the Vita is being outsold by both the Wii and the PSP in Europe.
3436160	3443200	Um, they're basically saying, um, that, uh, and this is actually a quote from Iwata of
3443200	3444200	Nintendo.
3444200	3447600	Saying that based on sales information by market research companies in each European
3447600	3456800	country, um, basically that the PS3 is the top with the 3DS and Xbox 360 in second.
3456800	3464480	The Wii in fourth, PSP in fifth, the Vita in sixth, and the DS, um, I guess right after
3464480	3465480	that.
3465480	3469880	So yeah, um, the Vita is basically selling 25,000 units a week.
3469880	3474540	Um, and there's still 70,000 PS3s being sold weekly.
3474540	3477920	Well that's some good news for Sony, at least the PS3's on top over there.
3477920	3480000	But Loki, any idea what this looks like in America?
3480000	3481000	Is this the same?
3481000	3482800	Are they having the same issue here?
3482800	3488080	I'm surprised that anyone's still selling a ton of PSPs, I know we don't sell any PSPs.
3488080	3492240	Um, and by we I mean my customers, because no one's asking for them.
3492240	3494360	And hell, there's nothing coming out for the PSP.
3494360	3502080	I mean, last thing was MLB 12, or MLB, um, yeah MLB The Show 12, wait no, MLB 2K12.
3502080	3508560	Um, but, and then there's a few Atlus RPGs, but that's all that really is coming.
3508560	3513200	According to Iwata right now in the US, um, actually no this isn't just according to him,
3513200	3516000	but there's other, there is a listing on here.
3516000	3522600	At the top of it is Xbox 360, then PS3, then the 3DS, and the Vita right behind the 3DS
3522600	3526320	and forth, then we have Wii, DS, and PSP.
3526320	3531400	Why is Iwata talking about the Vita, oh I see, because he's trying to say the 3DS is
3531400	3532400	so much better, blah blah blah.
3532400	3535880	Well he's saying that right now the 3DS is dominating in Japan.
3535880	3536880	I see.
3536880	3538080	Well it's been out for a year!
3538080	3539080	I mean, come on!
3539080	3541800	I mean, why are we even comparing these two systems, you're talking about a system that
3541800	3544800	launched two months ago versus a system that's been out like for a year.
3544800	3549320	Well and the Vita is kinda in that point where the 3DS was at this point after its launch,
3549320	3553120	where like, hooray, we had the launch with all the big launch games, now we're in a lull.
3553120	3557120	Yeah, it's like, listen Iwata, you better fuckin' keep that good karma coming because
3557120	3561160	if you start talking, you know, crap about this, you've got a system launching pretty
3561160	3563360	soon and it could tank pretty easy.
3563360	3569520	Well, really he's just been, you know, just speaking, more not, instead of you know, pooping
3569520	3574480	on everybody else, he's just more been speaking about, oh the 3DS is doing very well, we're
3574480	3576760	very confident in how the market's going.
3576760	3580840	But to the Vita's credit, I mean, you know, it's not the, because they do have some big
3580840	3584160	things here and there coming out, like the Mortal Kombat Vita is out pretty soon, that's
3584160	3585720	gonna be a pretty big deal for them.
3585720	3589600	They did release Skype on the Vita this week, which is pretty cool, you know, like their
3589600	3595960	FaceTime-esque sorta app, and I actually checked that out on the Vita, it runs very nicely.
3595960	3600660	And you know, the Vita does, had a more robust launch lineup, but it is still, there's nothing
3600660	3605520	to really get, I mean, Mortal Kombat, whether, you know, it is what it is, it's been out
3605520	3608480	already, it is a port of a game that's already been out for a year.
3608480	3613720	I would think come the holidays, E3 this year, we're gonna hear more about what the holidays
3613720	3616520	have in store for the Vita, and that's when things are really gonna pick up for them again.
3616520	3620400	To be fair, that's one more Mortal Kombat game than the 3DS has.
3620400	3621400	True.
3621400	3623880	No one's porting shit to the 3DS.
3623880	3628920	True, unless you want to say, well, you can play DS games on the 3DS, and I think there
3628920	3633080	was, I think Deadly Alliance, or one of them got a port to the DS, probably wasn't very
3633080	3634600	good, but it's there.
3634600	3641520	I mean, there's a Street Fighter IV game, you know, I don't know, it's just, yeah, I
3641520	3645720	don't really think it's fair to compare them yet, it's still, you know, compare their one
3645720	3646720	year numbers, okay?
3646720	3651640	One year, compare the numbers of the 3DS versus the numbers of the Vita in a year, and see
3651640	3652640	where they're at.
3652640	3654560	I'm not surprised that they're behind the 3DS.
3654560	3657640	A lot more people are picking up 3DSs, because I think they're cheaper now.
3657640	3662160	Shadownextgen in our chatroom at vognetwork.com says, a Vita price drop will be announced
3662160	3665760	to E3 if Sony is smart, agree?
3665760	3672000	They could, I know that the 3DS isn't dropping in price any time soon, so, I mean, they could,
3672000	3675640	it would be smart, but, I hope I get some free games with it.
3675640	3681000	I don't think a price drop will come, but I think they'll sweeten the pot of the existing
3681000	3682200	pack.
3682200	3687960	What I mean by that is, larger memory card, and probably more, like, throw-ins, like,
3687960	3693360	comes with an 8 gig memory card that already has little big planet Vita, oops, that's another
3693360	3696380	big game that's coming out at some point, right, no, that got pushed back, right?
3696380	3698720	It's not coming out any time soon, they haven't announced the date for it yet.
3698720	3701280	Alright, then fucking ModNation Racers Vita, I don't know, just...
3701280	3705200	Well, they could have Resistance, there's Gravity, you know, Gravity Rush, there's...
3705200	3708680	I would think they're gonna sweeten the pot of the existing pack, I don't think they're
3708680	3710480	gonna lower the price necessarily.
3710480	3714240	You know, I mean, they do like doing these different bundles, so, I could see them doing
3714240	3716960	some special, like, holiday bundles and stuff like that.
3716960	3720080	Baconbits in our chatroom, this will be the last comment on this story, then we'll move
3720080	3724160	on, Baconbits in our chatroom says, I don't want the Vita to fail, but I feel like it's
3724160	3725320	gonna happen.
3725320	3726320	It's too early!
3726320	3730480	Yeah, it's too, again, you gotta go back to where the 3DS was at this point, everybody
3730480	3735960	said, 3DS is gonna fail, 3DS is gonna fail, and then, bam, price drop, bam, Mario, bam,
3735960	3740440	you know, it's just, everything just hit it once, and then the system really recovered.
3740440	3746760	You know, and the PlayStation 3, early on, was hideous!
3746760	3751440	Too damn expensive and nothing on it, you know, but, PlayStations really come around,
3751440	3755720	so, you know, I think it's too early to bury the Vita.
3755720	3760240	Is the Vita flying off shelves in the must-have technology that Sony wanted it to be?
3760240	3764640	Alright, maybe not, but, that doesn't mean it's a dead and dying system.
3764640	3769880	They tried, I think, I mean, they had a better lineup at launch than the 3DS had, that's
3769880	3774680	for sure, and they have a lot more games coming out, and even the 3DS, I mean, there's games
3774680	3780280	coming out, but, I mean, for, I would think that, you know, like the hardcore gamer look,
3780280	3784080	you know, using the 3DS, I think there's only a handful of games really coming out before
3784080	3787840	the end of this year that they might be interested in, whereas I think there's gonna be a lot
3787840	3793520	more of that for the, the, I'm sorry, the 3DS has a handful of games.
3793520	3797120	The Vita, I think they've got, you know, quite a bit of potential games coming out for it,
3797120	3801800	I mean, hell, you know, there's some big first party games still on their way in the next
3801800	3807320	couple months, and, you know, Call of Duty's gonna help, I mean, fuck, a portable Call
3807320	3808320	of Duty game?
3808320	3813280	You know, not necessarily the PSP ones, because they're kinda, yeah, but, you know, one on
3813280	3816980	the Vita that's, you know, you've got like Black Ops 2 or whatever they're gonna call
3816980	3820360	it on the Vita, that could be pretty big.
3820360	3823960	Slidekick in our chatroom says, girl, PS3 is still hideous, Rob.
3823960	3824960	I disagree.
3824960	3825960	I really disagree.
3825960	3831720	It's, Little Big Planet is my, that's, there is nothing like it on Nintendo, there's nothing
3831720	3837360	like it on Microsoft, and it is an incredible video game, and it's, it's Sony's franchise,
3837360	3840020	you know, and that's just, you know, that's just the one that comes up to the mind is
3840020	3841440	most important for me.
3841440	3846840	I still say Sony, despite all our jokes earlier about Sixaxis, I think now Sony has the better
3846840	3847840	controller.
3847840	3851280	I prefer to play games with the Sony controller than I do the 360.
3851280	3853920	Sony does have the free online, for whatever it's worth.
3853920	3859280	You know, I don't mean to sound like a fanboy, there's reasons why I like 360 as well, but,
3859280	3861960	you know, I don't think it's all doom and gloom with the PlayStation 3.
3861960	3865600	I think, I think consumers have a real choice to make.
3865600	3870480	And when somebody asks me, Rob, what should I get, a PlayStation 3 or a Xbox 360?
3870480	3874640	It's a, I have to go back to the golden rule of gaming, a system is only as good as the
3874640	3875640	games that are on it.
3875640	3876640	What do you wanna play?
3876640	3877640	You wanna play Mario?
3877640	3878640	Or you wanna play LittleBigPlanet?
3878640	3879640	You wanna play Fable?
3879640	3881600	Or you wanna play God of War?
3881600	3885080	You know, it's really about those issues.
3885080	3889760	All right, anyhow, let's move on with some release dates.
3889760	3893400	We're gonna travel around the world and check out what's coming out soon in a store near
3893400	3894400	you.
3894400	3897200	There's not a lot this week, it's pretty dead.
3897200	3904680	So starting things off, we've got Sniper Elite V2 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.
3904680	3908040	Terra Online in the collector's edition as well.
3908040	3911320	That's coming out on PC, which should be pretty awesome.
3911320	3915200	Speaking of Mortal Kombat for the Vita, that is coming out this week.
3915200	3923440	And... and I honestly think that's probably it, because it's pretty dead.
3923440	3926840	I just wanna make sure I didn't miss anything.
3926840	3928440	Yep, that's it.
3928440	3932560	All right, traveling to Japan and looking at the releases over there in Japan.
3932560	3936080	Nothing on the 3DS this week, which strikes me as kinda odd, but yeah, no, nothing, nothing.
3936080	3938800	Oh my God, the system's dying!
3938800	3942920	Well, how about the Vita, what's the Vita got this week?
3942920	3943920	Also nothing.
3943920	3944920	That's a very...
3944920	3945920	That is also dying.
3945920	3947240	They're all dying.
3947240	3951960	On the PlayStation 3 this week, Starhawk on May 10th, although I think that's really next
3951960	3952960	week, actually.
3952960	3953960	That's the week after, yeah.
3953960	3956120	So, is there a holiday in Japan this week or something?
3956120	3960720	Because nothing on the PlayStation 3, and on the Xbox 360, nothing.
3960720	3965000	Oh my God, all game systems are gonna die.
3965000	3966240	They're all dying.
3966240	3968680	All of them.
3968680	3969680	Is it...
3969680	3973580	I don't know what's going on, there must be something, but it's very... not a lot of releases
3973580	3974580	till May 17th.
3974580	3976960	Things are kinda slowing down over there.
3976960	3979480	So I have nothing to report for Japanese releases.
3979480	3984060	Hey, the good news is, for those of you who like to import games, your wallet is spared
3984060	3985740	this month.
3985740	3988080	There's a few in Europe.
3988080	3989080	We have...
3989080	3990660	Thank you, Golden Week is this week.
3990660	3991660	That's right.
3991660	3992660	The chatters all just chimed in.
3992660	3993660	It's Golden Week.
3993660	3995600	That's when everyone goes back to their hometown.
3995600	3996600	Yep.
3996600	3997600	Yep.
3997600	4000600	What, no handheld games for the train ride there?
4000600	4001600	No Animal Crossing?
4001600	4004040	Rob, places are closed all week.
4004040	4008120	I knew, see, I knew the chatters would know something cultural that I was missing.
4008120	4010080	So yeah, Golden Week is the reason.
4010080	4012240	You know, us Ignite gamers.
4012240	4015420	I know, stupid Americans, sorry.
4015420	4019080	In Europe, on May 2nd, we have Velocity for the PSP.
4019080	4021000	On May 3rd, we have Terra for PC.
4021000	4026960	And on the 4th, we have Mud FIM, Motorcross World Championship, and that is it.
4026960	4027960	Next!
4027960	4032060	It must be Golden Week in the UK as well, huh?
4032060	4033060	It's no...
4033060	4034060	I want a Golden Week.
4034060	4035400	Why don't we have a Golden Week in the US?
4035400	4036400	Because we have Spring Break.
4036400	4037400	Yeah, but...
4037400	4039640	I wish we had Golden Week, too.
4039640	4041880	Shit doesn't close on Spring Break.
4041880	4042880	But...
4042880	4043880	That's because people...
4043880	4044880	Okay.
4044880	4047040	People here have no respect for their hometown, end of story.
4047040	4051080	We're comparing Golden Week to Spring Break.
4051080	4053000	Let's examine the two.
4053000	4058760	Golden Week, a great chance for me to go visit my family and really honor my family and,
4058760	4064060	you know, just be kind of forced to spend time with those I love and what's important.
4064060	4069280	Spring Break, bitches be getting drunk and topless and horny.
4069280	4070920	Woo!
4070920	4074720	I'm gonna get laid on Spring Break.
4074720	4075720	We don't understand.
4075720	4076720	Yeah!
4076720	4077720	It's Golden Week in Mexico.
4077720	4078720	Because...
4078720	4081360	See, it's Golden Week in Cancun.
4081360	4084840	Yeah, I mean, because they're like, cha-ching!
4084840	4088200	Here's our yearly revenue in one week.
4088200	4089200	I'm re...
4089200	4093680	It's Golden Peso Week, I don't know.
4093680	4094680	Exactly.
4094680	4098840	Slidekick in our chatroom says, Spring Break is better because it has wet t-shirt contests.
4098840	4100680	I didn't see that in Golden Week.
4100680	4103680	Can we move on, please?
4103680	4105800	Yes, we can move on.
4105800	4106800	Loki.
4106800	4114440	Maybe Golden Week all throughout the year if there's wet t-shirt contests involved.
4114440	4116000	And drunk sluts.
4116000	4119160	Well, for some people, that may be their hometown.
4119160	4120960	That's just Friday.
4120960	4123480	That's just Friday.
4123480	4126320	In here, it's always Friday.
4126320	4129120	Uh, yes.
4129120	4132320	Nintendo has some losses to report.
4132320	4137040	Yeah, they may have lost a little bit of money with 3DS.
4137040	4141920	Four hundred and sixty-one point two million dollars in losses, to be exact.
4141920	4146160	And of course, you know, they've kind of rebounded a little bit, but you know, the initial hit
4146160	4152800	from the new, you know, 3DS launch, and you know, the Redo's selling, well, also dropping
4152800	4158120	the price of the Wii, and they're seeing, you know, the strong-in and other things factored
4158120	4159120	into it.
4159120	4160120	Not a big surprise.
4160120	4162160	Of course, their brand new fiscal year started.
4162160	4170120	April first, and you know, they're aiming to not sell the 3DS under cost, because right
4170120	4176460	now they're actually losing money on each system that's being put out.
4176460	4177460	But not much.
4177460	4183240	I mean, they're, I believe it's, uh, actually no, it doesn't say how much they're losing
4183240	4184240	there.
4184240	4185240	I thought it was only like a few bucks.
4185240	4188920	But, you know, they're taking losses on each system, and of course, Nintendo, unlike the
4188920	4192680	other companies, they're actually like making profits on each piece of hardware that goes
4192680	4200200	out, which they were doing, obviously, when it was $250, but not necessarily now.
4200200	4206480	And then of course, they're saying that with the Wii U launch, and the Wii console, by
4206480	4212320	the end of next fiscal year, which would be March 31st, 2013, they're gonna have combined
4212320	4223800	sales of 10.5 million units, um, during that whole year, um, eh, maybe.
4223800	4231680	I guess, well fiscal 2012, they sold 9.84 million Wii units, so they're planning on
4231680	4233240	growing that a bit more.
4233240	4239320	Honestly, I don't see the Wii selling as fast as, you know, it was before.
4239320	4242440	Although, if they announce another price drop, because there's a new concept coming out.
4242440	4245800	I was gonna say a price drop is, that, that has to factor into this somehow.
4245800	4249880	If they drop the price again, that could be interesting.
4249880	4252800	Is that Wii, isn't the Wii already like 99 bucks, or?
4252800	4254440	No, it's still like 149.
4254440	4259480	Okay, so let's say they're gonna come out and the Wii is 99 bucks, that is, that's gonna
4259480	4260480	be hard to ignore.
4260480	4263920	Especially for the, like, you know what the big audience is for that, it's nobody that
4263920	4267560	listens to this show, unless you have like a 5 to 12 year old.
4267560	4268560	But here's my problem.
4268560	4270680	It's a huge sweet spot for the Wii.
4270680	4275440	That is a huge sweet spot for the Wii, and it will cannibalize the Wii U's sales.
4275440	4280480	Cause, I can buy this brand new console, it's basically a Wii, but it has better graphics
4280480	4287200	for $2.99, or I can pay $99 and get a Wii and play all these Mario games that I really
4287200	4290800	wanna play, and, um, that's it.
4290800	4293680	Then later on I'll upgrade to the, you know, the new Wii.
4293680	4298600	If there was a new Xbox or Playstation this year, I might agree with you, but I actually
4298600	4303600	think core gamer interest may be a little higher, especially if Nintendo does it right
4303600	4306480	and throws out a new Zelda game with this, although I'm not expecting it.
4306480	4307480	I'm not expecting it.
4307480	4313080	Or a Metroid, or something, you know, that the core gamers are gonna jizz over.
4313080	4317400	Just like seeing the lineup, just like kind of the whispers and stuff of their lineup.
4317400	4323500	A lot of it is like, Batman Arkham City, great, I get to play it on the Wii U, but it's been
4323500	4327920	out for a fucking year, and you know, Darksiders 2, okay, well that might be delayed by the
4327920	4332280	time we get there to, you know, the launch of the Wii, but it'll be out, like, Ninja
4332280	4336280	Gaiden 3, a game that sucked on the Xbox 360 and PS3.
4336280	4340000	Look, I think we really don't know though, because what Nintendo was trying to do with
4340000	4343200	that was say, hey, we can compete with everybody else now.
4343200	4346960	We're gonna have all the games that the other systems have, so leave us alone.
4346960	4349200	We don't really know what's coming.
4349200	4351240	I really do know what's coming.
4351240	4355240	Batman Arkham City is coming for the Wii U, I mean.
4355240	4359280	What if, heaven forbid, Loki, what if they're actually keeping some secrets?
4359280	4360280	They may have some first party secrets.
4360280	4361760	Animal Crossing Wii U.
4361760	4363080	Oh god.
4363080	4366520	I'm not buying it for, I'm sorry, I will not buy a system for Animal Crossing.
4366520	4368480	Now your little, your little Wii pad is a screwball.
4368480	4377640	I did that for GameDram, okay, but I will not do that for, no, seriously, it's just,
4377640	4380440	they're probably, they will probably have a Zelda game or something like that.
4380440	4382040	That would be pretty smart.
4382040	4384760	I don't think a Pikmin game is gonna launch that goddamn system, but.
4384760	4387900	I hope I'm not stepping on a story coming up later, because I remember reading this
4387900	4392260	earlier, but, you know, Nintendo has been talking about a new franchise.
4392260	4394520	Like maybe it's time for a new character.
4394520	4395520	Cool.
4395520	4398120	And I'm down with that, absolutely.
4398120	4399560	They need some new franchises.
4399560	4400560	Why not?
4400560	4404160	Well, I don't think they need franchises as bad as some other systems, but.
4404160	4406040	Well, I think that they should have some new franchises.
4406040	4407040	Why not?
4407040	4409640	I mean, see, I mean, fuck.
4409640	4412600	Story's kind of getting old, you know.
4412600	4417360	Maybe about time, Kid Icarus seems to have revived successfully enough.
4417360	4420320	Maybe when it's time you start looking at a franchise and put out a game for it in a
4420320	4424480	while that might be of the racing genre.
4424480	4428880	Although I do not disagree, what about a just new, something that doesn't exist yet?
4428880	4433040	I mean, Animal Crossing didn't exist until, well, here in America, the GameCube, but the
4433040	4434040	64.
4434040	4435040	You know, I completely agree with you.
4435040	4436040	You know it hasn't existed yet?
4436040	4440600	The fucking sequel to Excite Truck is what we need, is we need to excite truck too.
4440600	4444600	No, seriously, the best racing game on the Wii, eh, let's just piss it away.
4444600	4448240	We're gonna make a game with fucking mini games in the middle of a race.
4448240	4449600	That was geniusly stupid.
4449600	4452160	Look, I have more Wii stuff I gotta get out of here.
4452160	4457280	This is important because when the Wii U launches, one thing Nintendo's committed to, oh, I
4457280	4462440	should say, sorry, excuse me, misspoke, exploring, but when I read something like this, I go,
4462440	4463760	they're gonna do it.
4463760	4469240	Digital distribution of full retail games, starting on the 3DS, not even just the Wii
4469240	4474440	U, but starting on the 3DS with New Super Mario Brothers 2, will be available, digital
4474440	4479440	download as well as full retail release, but they made it very clear, choice.
4479440	4481440	You have a choice.
4481440	4483160	Apparently- And no price break.
4483160	4486440	They are being aggressive about the Wii U.
4486440	4491480	Iwata did announce Wii U games will be both in stores and digital distribution at launch.
4491480	4494360	See, I thought I had heard it confirmed in there, so I guess the 3DS is the one that's
4494360	4497240	being explored, but the Wii U, this is going to happen.
4497240	4500680	No, it is actually being done with the Wii, er, the 3DS.
4500680	4502000	They said they were gonna be doing it.
4502000	4506560	Oh, I, I was serious, they're exploring it, but that tells me it's gonna happen.
4506560	4511200	So anyhow, retailers will also be able to sell download codes, which is interesting.
4511200	4513920	Why would you do that?
4513920	4517860	I mean, I understand why you would do that, so you can take your games with you.
4517860	4522440	But remember, they tie to the system, not the account, which is very important.
4522440	4527200	I'm assuming if you ever upgrade your system, there's a way to transfer the licenses, because
4527200	4532440	I think there is with the ambassador program on the DS, but, you know, just kinda keep-
4532440	4536600	So anyhow, oh, yeah, they do, I guess they came out later and said, yes, we are doing
4536600	4537600	it.
4537600	4542040	Uh, August 2012 is when New Super Mario Brothers 2 is going to be the first game that's out.
4542040	4546440	Uh, packaged and digital formats, consumers can make the choice.
4546440	4551480	Also a game called Onitore, which is a temp name, is also supposed to be sold like this.
4551480	4553520	It's a brain age game.
4553520	4554520	Yeah.
4554520	4555520	Interesting.
4555520	4562760	Uh, one other thing about the 3DS, uh, it's all gonna be connected on- excuse me, the
4562760	4568840	Wii U and the 3DS are all connected through Nintendo eShop, and they say, quote, the majority,
4568840	4574240	key word, of first party 3DS and Wii U games will be sold this way.
4574240	4579840	The dual distribution strategy, digital downloads on launch day, you'll be able to get 16 digit
4579840	4584080	codes through the Nintendo eShop if you want to go buy it in a store or whatever.
4584080	4587360	That doesn't mean that I'm gonna open up a box and then it's gonna be a card, does it?
4587360	4588640	Cause that's kinda shitty.
4588640	4594200	Um, no, but Sony has tried that before, and they had Potapon 2, it was like that.
4594200	4596100	It was like, here's a case!
4596100	4598680	Those Vita games aren't far from it.
4598680	4602120	There is nothing in that Vita case but a little plastic slot to put in that cartridge.
4602120	4605760	You know what, at least that's something that I can sell back at some point if I feel like
4605760	4607120	it or sell it used.
4607120	4608120	That's true.
4608120	4614600	Um, but, once again though, I mean, this sounds like a great idea, but then we have to realize,
4614600	4620120	you know, it works for the Vita, I think it could work for the 3DS, but when we're talking
4620120	4625400	games that are gonna be significantly larger in size, and I'm talking about like actual
4625400	4630880	storage space on like a blu-ray disc, it's gonna get fucking annoying.
4630880	4638360	Yeah, I can download a title, you know, on my Wii U, but, I don't know, why would you?
4638360	4642920	But at the same time, the 3DS, it makes sense because people want to take their games with
4642920	4643920	them.
4643920	4646840	They don't wanna have to carry a bunch of cartridges, they can, you know, store a bunch
4646840	4651440	of games on there and that be done with it, but for the Wii U it doesn't make any sense.
4651440	4655320	I mean, I understand some people download full game, full digital games on like the
4655320	4657800	PS3 and stuff, but you can upgrade the hard drive and that thing.
4657800	4662800	I have a 500 gig hard drive, so that doesn't really bother me too much, but, you know,
4662800	4668280	if they're, they better have adequate storage, and it also takes a really long time.
4668280	4673960	Like I downloaded Infamous 1, which is a good 8 gig game, that took a couple hours.
4673960	4679480	You know, I'm not gonna wanna do that for a game that's larger than a DVD-R.
4679480	4683700	You know, we're talking like, you know, 6, double that size, maybe even triple that size.
4683700	4686040	That's gonna, why would you do that and kill your bandwidth?
4686040	4689400	Alright, let me give one other quote here about the license rights, so we can talk about
4689400	4690400	that real quick.
4690400	4695800	Iwata did state that the 3DS retail games will be stored in the SD memory card and be
4695800	4699960	playable only with the hardware to which it was downloaded, so that, you know, unlike
4699960	4704240	how you get to share a packaged software, the consumer cannot share the software with
4704240	4709320	other 3DS systems owned by other members of the family or friends.
4709320	4713640	But that's not any different than the eShop games that are there now, like say VVVVV or
4713640	4714640	whatever, it's the same way.
4714640	4718920	It's too bad they couldn't have just added a feature to the cards where you can download
4718920	4723640	it to a certain system, and once it's downloaded to that system, it marks something in the
4723640	4727280	card that, you know, shows that it's been downloaded to a system and you can't download
4727280	4728280	it again.
4728280	4733240	But you can still play the card, or you can revoke your privileges and then it, you know,
4733240	4736960	clears out whatever that is, and granted I'm sure someone will hack, or could possibly
4736960	4737960	hack it, but...
4737960	4740680	Sort of like how iTunes has authorize, authorizing computers.
4740680	4741960	Something like that, yeah.
4741960	4743360	Yeah, that's a good way to think about it.
4743360	4747440	I mean, but that would have required them to have, you know, forethought, you know,
4747440	4751320	for this stuff, and since they didn't do that at launch, and it's been out for a year now,
4751320	4752960	probably not gonna happen.
4752960	4756520	Porkchop in our chatroom says if the market goes entirely digital, it's a massive middle
4756520	4757960	finger to the gamer.
4757960	4760760	And ShadowNextGen says that'll eventually happen, Porkchop.
4760760	4761760	It's inevitable.
4761760	4763200	It's not gonna happen.
4763200	4765280	It's not gonna happen any time soon.
4765280	4768240	I don't think it'll happen soon, but...
4768240	4769240	It's not.
4769240	4770920	The consumer can ultimately reject it.
4770920	4771920	The PSP Go.
4771920	4774800	I want a return of Neo Geo size cartridges.
4774800	4777320	The PSP Go was rejected by the consumer.
4777320	4782700	It's not gonna happen because, first off, the consumer likes having physical product,
4782700	4786400	and the reason why they like having, you know, physical product is because it feels like
4786400	4788300	they actually own something.
4788300	4793040	Having everything digital that's basically allowing, like, a third party company, like,
4793040	4796240	you know, Intender or whatever, they can revoke the privileges whenever they want.
4796240	4801140	And just to be fair, ShadowNextGen in the chat says I didn't say it would happen soon, so...
4801140	4804280	I don't think it's gonna happen any time in the near future, and...
4804280	4805560	It's just, it's too convenient.
4805560	4811200	It's more convenient to go to a store, I mean, seriously, am I going to, uh, spend like ten
4811200	4816740	minutes driving to a local store and picking up a copy of a game, oh, that's such an inconvenience,
4816740	4819360	or wait six hours for the same game to fucking download?
4819360	4824280	I'll tell you it's fucking convenient, and not to sound like a commercial, but, um, Amazon
4824280	4827780	will have that fucker on my doorstep when I get home from work.
4827780	4829360	That's convenient to me.
4829360	4834660	It's, there are ways that are more convenient than, but the thing is, they want everyone
4834660	4838520	to think digital is where it's at, because they make the most money with that, and they
4838520	4841280	have the most control over their product that way.
4841280	4847120	It kind of sort of eliminates piracy a little bit, I mean, it's not, not really, uh...
4847120	4850920	We need to, we need to take a step back, you guys, we need to take a step back to simpler
4850920	4851920	times.
4851920	4855080	We need to go back to when digital distribution wasn't even a thing.
4855080	4856080	It was nothing.
4856080	4858240	You know how you digitally distributed something?
4858240	4862200	You got it on the back of a truck to your nearby Chuck E. Cheese.
4862200	4863200	That was distribution.
4863200	4866920	The classic game of the week.
4866920	4871440	Dark Soccer's gonna take a trip down memory lane and find a game inside the gaming vault
4871440	4878040	that she thinks, hey, listen up, Iwata digital mofos.
4878040	4882280	This is a true classic that you all should play right freaking now.
4882280	4885680	Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week, the first classic game of the week involved?
4885680	4888800	Well, this is also one that comes from Dan, so thank him for that.
4888800	4893680	And I'm going to start off by reading actually the, the spoiler, the splash for the original
4893680	4894680	poster.
4894680	4895680	Okay.
4895680	4898480	First the pinball universe, now the world of video.
4898480	4900920	Once again, Williams reigns supreme.
4900920	4901920	Mmm.
4901920	4902920	Defender.
4902920	4903920	Defender.
4903920	4911360	And, uh, is, I mean, how can we not go back to the real classics there, you know?
4911360	4917880	So defender came out for the arcade, um, done by Williams in 1980, which is a shooting game,
4917880	4920320	all 2d back in the day.
4920320	4921320	Hi.
4921320	4925500	And, um, you have to basically defeat all these different invading aliens while protecting
4925500	4927400	your astronauts.
4927400	4931960	It was developed by Eugene Jarvis, who I've actually at classic gaming expo a couple,
4931960	4936940	a few years back, I got to sit in on a panel with him and it was just awesome listening
4936940	4938060	to this guy talk about it.
4938060	4941300	By the way, this video that we're playing the audio from is already quiet and this game
4941300	4943520	didn't really have a lot of, you know, I didn't have a lot of noise.
4943520	4948280	It was pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, not a lot to hear, but there are some laser noises for
4948280	4949280	you.
4949280	4953840	Um, anyway, uh, this was the first game that Eugene Jarvis programmed.
4953840	4955840	He was a pinball programmer before that.
4955840	4959920	Um, and he was inspired by space invaders and asteroids.
4959920	4966240	Um, the plan was to display the game at the amusement and music operators association.
4966240	4968320	Um, but it was delayed.
4968320	4974400	Um, the game itself though was highly successful, sold 55,000 units and it was their best selling
4974400	4976760	arcade game.
4976760	4984640	And uh, basically, uh, it's the game pretty much that put, you know, Eugene Jarvis's name
4984640	4990980	amongst, you know, the, the top contributors to the video game industry there is.
4990980	4993480	So that's pretty cool.
4993480	5000460	At any rate, um, when it was developed, it was, uh, Williams, uh, first attempt at any
5000460	5002540	video game there.
5002540	5008160	The earlier one that they had was basically a version of Pong and, uh, they were really,
5008160	5013920	really trying to cash in on how popular video games were getting in 1979.
5013920	5021320	So they had basically one of their best pinball, uh, uh, programmers get right to it.
5021320	5025520	He also, um, he headed the department and there's other like big names that were involved
5025520	5026520	with that.
5026520	5031840	Uh, Larry Damar, Sam Dicker, uh, Paul Dassault, um, they were all involved in this.
5031840	5035840	They worked, uh, under him as the head.
5035840	5040920	So basically, um, Jarvis, just going into the development history, spent three to four
5040920	5047520	months, um, working on different versions of Taito space invaders and Atari's asteroids
5047520	5050960	and, uh, tried to work games that had similar mechanics.
5050960	5055880	Asteroids, of course, was, uh, vector, um, had a special monitor, but this one he wanted
5055880	5059040	to really work on a conventional monitor.
5059040	5064420	So, uh, basically they just, uh, took what they liked from asteroids being the warping
5064420	5068080	effects they really liked and then wanted a player to be able to fly back and forth
5068080	5069760	across the screen.
5069760	5078600	Um, he only wanted it to go, um, from left to right, but a person who I have met convinced
5078600	5080000	him to make it scroll around.
5080000	5082720	You know who that is?
5082720	5083720	Who?
5083720	5084720	Steve Ritchie.
5084720	5085720	Oh.
5085720	5089360	Who was the man that designed, he actually was the voice of the Black Knight and the
5089360	5091960	voice of the skull in, uh, No Fear.
5091960	5093720	Was he the voice of Sinstar?
5093720	5094720	Beware.
5094720	5095720	Yes.
5095720	5096720	I lit, that guy's awesome.
5096720	5097720	I think, I think it was him.
5097720	5099160	I want him to do bumpers for VoG.
5099160	5101200	But I could talk to him.
5101200	5102200	Sweet.
5102200	5109280	But, um, he, uh, he's also the guy that designed, uh, Twilight Zone and Black Knight.
5109280	5110280	Steve Ritchie.
5110280	5112920	He's, and he is the sweetest, sweetest guy.
5112920	5117480	Anyway, um, moving forward, he basically was the guy that suggested that it should scroll
5117480	5118480	in either direction.
5118480	5125800	So, it took six months to develop it and, uh, they really pushed it through and, uh,
5125800	5132680	so now, um, they have the, basically they added in the Planetscape background as sort
5132680	5133720	of an afterthought.
5133720	5139240	And if you'll notice, it's only a pixel wide, those lines, because the hardware wasn't powerful
5139240	5142640	enough to do anything better.
5142640	5146320	So basically after that six months, they really pushed it for, uh, for the try to get it done
5146320	5148760	by, um, AMOA.
5148760	5153200	But it took a lot later to do and they incorporated more things.
5153200	5156320	They had the swarmers, the pods, all the different gameplay.
5156320	5162400	And then they had, um, they created erasable programmable read-only memory chips for the
5162400	5165400	game to install the cabinets, but they didn't work.
5165400	5168720	So they actually had to do more to get it to work.
5168720	5170560	They got the attract mode operational.
5170560	5174840	They got all of the stuff done and finally had it playable.
5174840	5178760	So the game itself is basically, um, it's monaural sound.
5178760	5186720	It's pixel on CRT and it's being, uh, run by a Motorola again, uh, 6809 central processing
5186720	5187720	chip.
5187720	5191380	So, which is big stuff in 1980.
5191380	5196600	So the game actually, um, it didn't really attract a lot of attention in 1980 when it
5196600	5202720	came out, but it, uh, ended up, uh, being well received in the arcades.
5202720	5206320	And there were tons of crowds during the play testing.
5206320	5209440	So they actually did a cocktail version of this as well.
5209440	5212000	So like I said, they sold over 55,000 units worldwide.
5212000	5214600	I want a cocktail machine so fucking bad.
5214600	5218560	By 2004, the game was a collector's item.
5218560	5224040	Um, the upright cabinets you could still find, but the cocktail tables, of course, you know
5224040	5227640	how that went, you can hardly find them at all.
5227640	5233960	And, uh, it was actually considered one of the most successful games in 1981.
5233960	5234960	It outperformed Pac-Man.
5234960	5235960	Just saying.
5235960	5236960	Huh?
5236960	5242880	I mean, the graphics at its time or completely revolutionary.
5242880	5245480	It did things that you hadn't seen in the game before.
5245480	5251320	And you know, all this by a guy who had not ever done a video game before.
5251320	5252320	He didn't pinball.
5252320	5254760	But sometimes it just takes a different perspective.
5254760	5255760	You know?
5255760	5256760	Yeah.
5256760	5261240	But I mean, and since then we've had so many different games, uh, reference it so many
5261240	5265320	different games, uh, actually work off of things of it.
5265320	5270680	There were software bugs in the game that allowed people to extend their length of time.
5270680	5272880	And there was another one that kept track on how it scores.
5272880	5275200	So basically people could keep earning extra lives and stuff.
5275200	5281440	I mean, we're talking early game hacking, you know, this, you know, hacking, you know,
5281440	5283720	Street Fighter X Tekken is nothing new.
5283720	5285960	People were doing it in the 80s.
5285960	5290160	Um, you remember the dude that did Pac-Man Fever?
5290160	5291160	Little Buckner and Garcia?
5291160	5292280	Yeah, of course.
5292280	5299040	This was, uh, they did a, uh, um, song called The Defender on that album.
5299040	5305360	And Beastie Boys actually referred to it in Body Movin' because Beastie Boys are awesome.
5305360	5308920	So I mean, and if you think about this, how many other games do we have come out since
5308920	5315040	then that, like my, my favorite game, Fantasy Zone, is that not pretty much Defender?
5315040	5317520	It inspired, heavily inspired.
5317520	5318520	With Cutesy-ness?
5318520	5324200	You know, we had, and of course this, you know, basically opened the door to all kinds
5324200	5328720	of other games like, um, GORF and Phoenix.
5328720	5336880	So just saying, you know, as far as remakes, um, there was, uh, a game called Stargate
5336880	5340000	that was considered a sequel to Defender.
5340000	5341600	Um, different elements.
5341600	5343960	Uh, Midway put out Strike Force.
5343960	5348320	Some folks in chat, by the way, talking about, uh, Defender 2 on the NES, which was Stargate,
5348320	5349320	yeah.
5349320	5353920	You know, as far as, uh, other home versions came out, like Defense Command, Reptile, Drop
5353920	5357280	Zone, Protector 2, that copied the design.
5357280	5364920	Um, Chopper Command for Atari 2600 and, uh, Choplifter for Apple II, um, were, again, mimics
5364920	5365920	of Defender.
5365920	5366920	I didn't even think about that.
5366920	5367920	You're right.
5367920	5368920	Chopper Command really was the same damn game.
5368920	5369920	Yeah.
5369920	5370920	I remember.
5370920	5371920	I, uh, my friend owned that.
5371920	5372920	We used to play the shit out of that.
5372920	5377720	And it's been released on so many different, you know, re-releases like, uh, 1996's Williams
5377720	5383160	Arcade Greatest Hits, the 2000 Midway's Arcade, um, Greatest Arcade Hits, and 2003 Midway
5383160	5384720	Arcade Treasures.
5384720	5387840	We also, um, on Shockwave.com, you can play Defender.
5387840	5393240	Sorry, I just wanted to look really quickly at, uh, Chopper Command here on the Atari
5393240	5394240	2600.
5394240	5397960	Yeah, see, you have to protect your dudes on the bottom.
5397960	5399520	Yeah, the little trucks on the bottom.
5399520	5400520	Yeah.
5400520	5401520	Yeah.
5401520	5402520	Did they get lifted up by the choppers?
5402520	5403520	I forgot how that worked.
5403520	5406400	Oh, no, they're just getting, but that's the difference.
5406400	5407400	They don't get lifted up.
5407400	5408400	They just get, like, attacked.
5408400	5409400	Yeah.
5409400	5411040	You have to save the little astronauts in Defender.
5411040	5413360	That guy's not very good at Chopper Command.
5413360	5423960	But anyway, I mean, and then, um, in 2002, there, um, there was the sequel that, uh,
5423960	5432160	that was just called Defender that, uh, was, uh, uh, believe was the 3D that was, that
5432160	5433160	worked similarly.
5433160	5435160	So, but yeah, Defender.
5435160	5437800	There it is, your classic game of the week, Defender.
5437800	5438800	Good choice.
5438800	5442000	Now I, now I actually really do need to get a hold of Steve Ritchie.
5442000	5447240	All right, that's going to do it for part A of Orange Launch Radio, but don't go anywhere.
5447240	5452080	Part B is coming up next here on VOG, and we're going to start off with some big news
5452080	5455240	in part B, so I hope you guys don't go anywhere, because we'll be right back after this with
5455240	5463600	more of Orange Launch Radio.
5463600	5468080	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Launch Radio and our inaugural broadcast here on
5468080	5472520	the VOG, vognetwork.com, the voice of geeks network.
5472520	5476400	And right now, just three shows on the actual radio network, VOG network will be more than
5476400	5480000	just a radio station, but that's kind of the, that's the centerpiece of the dinner table
5480000	5481360	right now is the radio station.
5481360	5486040	Uh, just ourselves and, uh, Bobby Blackwolf, who you heard before us and the great folks
5486040	5492800	at under sedation live in their 11th year, God bless them or whatever you believe in,
5492800	5497440	uh, eight o'clock on Saturday Pacific, 11 o'clock Eastern.
5497440	5501840	They're late night cause they're dirty, but it's a good time, a little dirty, but it's
5501840	5502880	a good time.
5502880	5504000	You should definitely tune in.
5504000	5506680	I'll say this cause I know Jessica's in the chat right now.
5506680	5509900	Jessica will whip Travis into shape on Saturday night.
5509900	5514520	So if you want to hear him get a whooping tune in on Saturday, no, it's, it is a really
5514520	5515520	good time.
5515520	5519280	Uh, anyhow, I got to go back on that show and guess sometime for sure.
5519280	5526240	Anyway, we are here and, uh, talking about video games and thank God some late breaking
5526240	5542920	news, some late breaking news here on the VOG and orange lounge radio breaking news.
5542920	5545640	And we have to go to our correspondent for this story.
5545640	5546920	This isn't even my thing.
5546920	5551520	This was a, we've got to go to our core respondent for this story.
5551520	5555840	So I'm looking them up to give them a call right now, except, Oh, there he is.
5555840	5557280	I always look under the wrong name here.
5557280	5560480	So let's, uh, give our correspondent a little call here so we can talk about the breaking
5560480	5565080	news this evening, all the way in New York city.
5565080	5566080	Rama is joining us.
5566080	5567080	Hey Rama, you there?
5567080	5568080	Hey, I'm right here.
5568080	5569080	Sky.
5569080	5570080	How are you guys out in the Sacramento studios?
5570080	5575320	I'm relieved because the show is actually online tonight because trust me, there was
5575320	5578360	a plan B in case VOG didn't work, but it works.
5578360	5581600	I mean, despite the hiccup earlier, that was a Comcast fail.
5581600	5582600	We're shit.
5582600	5583600	We're used to those.
5583600	5586960	We've, we've had 10 years of those on the other networks we've been in.
5586960	5589040	So otherwise VOG's working great.
5589040	5592480	And I got to say this, I am so happy.
5592480	5593800	I can't even tell you.
5593800	5598560	We have hit higher numbers tonight on this new network than I've seen in a long, long,
5598560	5599560	long time.
5599560	5602760	And I think a lot of that really is just the combined forces of Bobby's audience and our
5602760	5606480	audience and you know, the curious looky-loos, the people that Geek Life brought in just
5606480	5609320	all kind of, you know, joining together tonight.
5609320	5611060	And I, I'm just so happy.
5611060	5613880	And I hope the momentum continues through the few weeks.
5613880	5614880	I'm all for that.
5614880	5615880	Yeah, me too.
5615880	5618400	So anyway, it's not, you're not calling us to talk about VOG tonight.
5618400	5620840	You have some news for us, I guess you become privy too.
5620840	5621840	What's going on Rama?
5621840	5622840	Yes, yes, yes.
5622840	5623840	I do have news.
5623840	5629440	Now recently with Anime Jam Session, we've gotten connected to another podcast out here
5629440	5631260	called the Brooklyn Otaku.
5631260	5634120	We've been joining forces and working on some projects.
5634120	5639920	Now one of the hosts of the Brooklyn Otaku hooked me up with some very privy information
5639920	5643040	today at the Sakura Matsuri.
5643040	5644040	What's that?
5644040	5645040	First off, Sakura Matsuri...
5645040	5646040	Cherry Blossom Festival.
5646040	5647040	Cherry Blossom.
5647040	5648040	Thank you.
5648040	5651080	I was going to let him explain, but that's all right.
5651080	5652080	There he goes.
5652080	5654520	Fair enough.
5654520	5659280	So Sakura Matsuri, you ran into your friends at Brooklyn Otaku and?
5659280	5665320	One of the hosts there has told me that the return of one of the greatest arcades in New
5665320	5667600	York City will be back.
5667600	5671520	Chinatown Fair is reopening this Friday.
5671520	5672520	Yay!
5672520	5674320	Chinatown Fair reopening this Friday.
5674320	5676600	I've never been to Chinatown Fair.
5676600	5682360	The legendary arcade in these parts was Arcade Infinity, which when I say in these parts
5682360	5684240	I mean six hours away.
5684240	5686400	But what makes Chinatown Fair so special?
5686400	5689120	Why is this big news for the East Coast folks?
5689120	5692080	It's like the bastion of arcade gaming.
5692080	5697440	This is where you go to play all the greatest, at the time, fighting games, dancing games,
5697440	5698440	all types of video games.
5698440	5699880	This is where you came.
5699880	5705080	It's like nowhere else in New York City you could go except here because it was quiet
5705080	5707120	or loud, however you want to take it.
5707120	5708120	And it was fun.
5708120	5712840	Plus there was also a chicken that could tell you a fortune.
5712840	5716600	Arcade Infinity did not have a fortune teller chicken.
5716600	5717600	That's right.
5717600	5718600	It did not have a fortune telling chicken.
5718600	5719600	It did have um jammerlami.
5719600	5724040	I didn't go to any of the other shops around there so they could have had fortune telling
5724040	5725040	chickens.
5725040	5729040	Is there a big opening plan thing scheduled?
5729040	5735000	I do believe the grand opening will be this Friday and from my understanding they're changing
5735000	5736000	things around a little bit.
5736000	5741480	It's going to be more of a Chuck E. Cheese, Dave and Buster style place.
5741480	5744880	I shudder when I hear Chuck E. Cheese but Dave and Buster, does that mean they're selling
5744880	5745880	booze?
5745880	5749520	Exclusive Chinatown Fair to carry booze in the parking lot.
5749520	5751240	I hope so.
5751240	5755080	I do believe I'll be going down there Friday after work to check it out and see what's
5755080	5756080	going on.
5756080	5763200	Well then I need picks and stuff for the VOG website feature stuff that will come later.
5763200	5764200	Oh definitely.
5764200	5767360	Dave and Buster's they mean not letting kids in.
5767360	5769720	Yeah that'll be great.
5769720	5772200	Exclusive kids band from the new Chinatown Fair.
5772200	5773200	That's good.
5773200	5776160	Well they were kind of sort of banned before.
5776160	5780960	Pretty much if you were in school and you were there during school hours you were escorted
5780960	5785080	out of the place but I've never been there during those times to see if they actually
5785080	5786080	enforce that rule.
5786080	5790040	Alright well thank you for sharing the news with us Rama and thanks to your friends at
5790040	5791040	The Other Show too.
5791040	5794280	Since we have you on the line I know you like to call in during the show later anyway.
5794280	5798800	Is there anything else you want to share with us tonight about your week?
5798800	5803640	Yeah but how about I save that for that portion of the show.
5803640	5806520	Okay then I guess we'll wait for that call later on.
5806520	5809160	Yeah if I can't make it on I can't make it on.
5809160	5810160	It is what it is.
5810160	5811160	We have a lot of new listeners.
5811160	5813560	Those will let the fresh blood in you know.
5813560	5815960	Yeah you gotta let other people have a turn once in a while Rama.
5815960	5817120	Alright take care buddy.
5817120	5819560	We're gonna get back to the show.
5819560	5822520	Oh he hung up there you go.
5822520	5826200	Alright there it is breaking news and also breaking news exclusive Loki's mic was off
5826200	5828560	that whole time says the chatters.
5828560	5830160	I don't know whatever.
5830160	5831160	Can we hear you?
5831160	5833600	I still can't hear you.
5833600	5834800	Is mine on?
5834800	5838480	I hear my voice.
5838480	5842000	Your mic is, talk for a minute for me.
5842000	5843000	Hello.
5843000	5846280	Oh god.
5846280	5848240	Didn't you, you didn't fiddle with anything over here?
5848240	5849240	No.
5849240	5850240	Oh.
5850240	5851240	Rob had one mute.
5851240	5857200	You fiddled with my microphone you bastard.
5857200	5859200	I had nothing intelligent to interject.
5859200	5866560	And the fail award of the evening goes to Rob for mute button fail.
5866560	5867560	Like I'd fiddle with a microphone.
5867560	5868560	What do you think I'd do?
5868560	5869560	Hey!
5869560	5870560	Chords!
5870560	5871560	I'm gonna yank on those.
5871560	5872560	You'd do it?
5872560	5875160	No he's gonna pretend he's Sanrio and chew on them.
5875160	5877160	I've never done that before.
5877160	5878160	Alright whatever.
5878160	5883320	I'm gonna hop up on the table and rage through the like.
5883320	5885880	So Rob this coffee is delicious thank you.
5885880	5886880	No you're welcome anytime.
5886880	5889400	I've just put up two pictures on the OLR website.
5889400	5890680	Sure that's what they wanted to see.
5890680	5893080	One of them was coffee and the other one was my mouse pad.
5893080	5896320	Alright I'll take a short, we're gonna get to rapid fire news but sure I'll take a question.
5896320	5900120	It's the show where every gamer has a voice so sometimes we get thrown random ass questions
5900120	5902760	in the VoG chat room and I'll answer them.
5902760	5906640	Nietzsche, OLR did you guys happen to play any of the Diablo 3 open beta?
5906640	5908360	If so what class did you play?
5908360	5909360	Hell no.
5909360	5912760	I didn't play the open beta but I played the closed beta back in October and I played a
5912760	5914280	monk and it was a lot of fun.
5914280	5917400	I played monk and witch doctor and I really preferred monk.
5917400	5918680	It was a good time.
5918680	5921600	I called the witch doctor.
5921600	5922880	It looked like, it looked interesting.
5922880	5927160	I played the original Diablo and I had fun with that.
5927160	5928400	I did not play any of the beta.
5928400	5935880	I got invited to the beta for missile pandarian but I don't play wow so I have no interest
5935880	5936880	in that.
5936880	5940320	Everyone pretty much got invited in the last wave.
5940320	5942920	Rapid fire news, let's get to it Loki.
5942920	5946880	So this is interesting, Joyride is getting a sequel.
5946880	5947880	Why?
5947880	5948880	Why?
5948880	5949880	I don't know.
5949880	5950880	It wasn't a very fun game.
5950880	5954320	It wasn't a very fun game but they're hoping to make it more fun by removing Kinect.
5954320	5956560	Isn't that ironic?
5956560	5961760	So yes, Joyride, not Kinect Joyride anymore, will be getting a brand new title on Xbox
5961760	5962860	Live Arcade.
5962860	5968800	It will be called Joyride Turbo and apparently it will have absolutely no Kinect support
5968800	5973360	whatsoever and it's going to be just standard controller support which is fine if you think
5973360	5977960	about it because originally it was supposed to be just a, you know, just an Xbox Live
5977960	5982120	Arcade title that was supposed to be free and then they were going to have a bunch of
5982120	5985320	other crap that you could download and expand it with because it was going to be a free
5985320	5986320	to play type thing.
5986320	5990120	They're going to have an all new stunt park and then I guess you can do different stunts
5990120	5994800	like jumping off cliffs and whatnot but that'll be coming out later on.
5994800	5998840	Maybe if it's, you know, supposed to be in the summer or something, maybe a part of their
5998840	6003480	summer thing that they're doing, I'm going to be willing to bet.
6003480	6004480	You know what?
6004480	6009120	It sounds kind of interesting then if it is without, you know, Kinect because Kinect kind
6009120	6013840	of hurt that game but it could have been fun.
6013840	6015920	So I'd be willing to check out the demo at least.
6015920	6018480	I'll check out the demo at least.
6018480	6019480	So hmm.
6019480	6020480	Alright.
6020480	6025160	Now something I really could care less about or couldn't care less I guess, Pikmin 2 is
6025160	6029120	getting its new play control game on the Wii this June.
6029120	6034240	Now for those who may not remember, they did this thing called new play control way back
6034240	6040120	in 2009 where they were taking some of these old GameCube games and adding some Wii support
6040120	6044720	on top of them and that's about it and they had a couple games that came out and then
6044720	6050520	they kind of stopped and this actually came out in Japan and Europe in 2009 but for whatever
6050520	6055120	reason they decided, hey, we're going to bring it out in the US now.
6055120	6058360	Thanks Nintendo for bringing this to us.
6058360	6063880	So the Wii could have a game although it isn't, what the hell is the name of that game?
6063880	6064880	The big?
6064880	6065880	Why?
6065880	6066880	It's escaping me.
6066880	6069320	The last story is coming out, yes.
6069320	6071760	I was going to say Litterbox Chronicles.
6071760	6076560	The last story is coming out in June but honestly they haven't had a first party Wii title since,
6076560	6079920	well, then Mario Party 9 had been the last first party Wii title and that was in the
6079920	6082440	beginning of March.
6082440	6086480	I mean they have an intended, they have the Pokemon Conquest game which you know, the
6086480	6088640	Ice D-Wares cross Pokemon.
6088640	6091960	Hey, I'm, I'm curious.
6091960	6092960	Let's just put it that.
6092960	6093960	I'm curious.
6093960	6101120	Um, I just think it's kind of like, here, here you go, this is something that you really
6101120	6102120	wanted.
6102120	6105600	So, so we're going to like, what is it, we're going to get the, fuck, I don't even remember
6105600	6109600	the other games that have been released in other territories but not, are we going to
6109600	6111920	get Captain Rainbow at some point, you know?
6111920	6113960	Are they going to like localize that?
6113960	6118120	What the hell is Captain Rainbow?
6118120	6125680	It was a game that came out in Japan that was, um, it was all these like old, uh.
6125680	6130440	What was the one with all the sexy men dudes that was like hole in the wall basically?
6130440	6131440	No, no.
6131440	6132440	That did come out here, didn't it?
6132440	6133440	That did come out here.
6133440	6135240	Yes, that came out here but Captain Rainbow did not.
6135240	6139120	Captain Rainbow was the one that had like all of the misfit Nintendo characters.
6139120	6144320	Like Birdo was in it and stuff like that and it was just ridiculous.
6144320	6149960	I want that, there's Birdo right there.
6149960	6156400	What are you playing as?
6156400	6158400	Captain Rainbow, dummy.
6158400	6159960	Shut up.
6159960	6165480	It's like just this panned out thing, I was like, he's Falcon Punching.
6165480	6170920	His eyes are big flames.
6170920	6176160	He's doing rainbow things to that door.
6176160	6178680	Maybe they just think we wouldn't get it.
6178680	6180200	I play it.
6180200	6187560	Exactly, it's really weird but um, there was another game though that was, um, and I don't
6187560	6190320	remember for the life of me what the hell it was called.
6190320	6194120	It was like Disaster Day in Crisis or something like that, I think.
6194120	6195640	You know what else we don't have here?
6195640	6197720	Tingle's Adventure or whatever that game was.
6197720	6199720	Yeah, it's because it sucked.
6199720	6203880	I'm sorry, no Tingle game here.
6203880	6208840	That's the new franchise Nintendo needs to explore, Tingle.
6208840	6210240	Listen, no they don't.
6210240	6212280	He is a really fucking annoying character.
6212280	6216960	We do not need to bring this crap back up.
6216960	6220160	Tingle's Epic Quest.
6220160	6221640	I would, Epic Tingle.
6221640	6222720	I will tell you what.
6222720	6225560	You know what, I think Epic Tingle would be a better game.
6225560	6229880	If they launch the Wii U at the Tingle game, I will buy that system.
6229880	6234000	I thought you were going to say you'd dress up finally, the bet we've been trying to get
6234000	6235000	forever.
6235000	6237640	You know that would actually be like the easiest costume ever because all you'd have to do
6237640	6239120	is like sweat in a hoodie.
6239120	6240120	Alright.
6240120	6243600	Moving on, do you have any other rapid fire news or is that it?
6243600	6244600	That was it.
6244600	6248680	No, no, I got one more and that's a little bit better and I'm sure this is gonna, this
6248680	6250960	may actually sell some vidas for some people.
6250960	6257600	DGMax Technica Tune is actually coming out to the North America region for the Vita this
6257600	6262840	summer and will also, I guess, you know, it looks pretty awesome.
6262840	6265920	It looks just like the arcade stuff.
6265920	6268280	Alright.
6268280	6270760	I'm very interested in DGMax Technica for the Vita actually.
6270760	6274640	I think it'll be very fun and I'm sure some of our music game fans in the chat room are
6274640	6276400	very much looking forward to this as well.
6276400	6279120	So I mean, that is, that was kind of cool.
6279120	6281600	Alright, let's move on to some other quick stories here.
6281600	6285520	First one about THQ, who's been having some financial issues lately, even though things
6285520	6291160	seem to be getting a little better, but one part is going away and that is ValueSoft.
6291160	6293200	You may not know what ValueSoft is.
6293200	6294600	I'm well aware of ValueSoft.
6294600	6296840	No, they make budget PC games.
6296840	6299280	So like when you see the little budget Wii games too.
6299280	6305080	$10 rack at Target of PC games and all that, it's, these games are in there.
6305080	6307720	I want to see they run by Activision at one time.
6307720	6312240	Maybe, but they're not going to be run by THQ anymore because they just sold it off.
6312240	6317320	Apparently they are the second largest US retail publisher of PC games in terms of units
6317320	6318320	sold.
6318320	6319320	I had no idea.
6319320	6325840	But anyhow, I guess what is happening, oh no, I'm sorry, Cosme is buying them and together
6325840	6329540	it will make them the second largest US retail publisher.
6329540	6330540	So I see where it is.
6330540	6334520	So ValueSoft was, wasn't, but now they will be with Cosme who they've sold it to.
6334520	6337680	To be fair, they do have their purpose in the industry.
6337680	6340800	It's like, you know, seriously, if you're having a game that you're putting out that
6340800	6345240	maybe is not that great and not necessarily that's not that great, but, um, at least there's
6345240	6349680	a publisher out there for your independent game if you really want to.
6349680	6353600	So if OLR the game ever becomes a reality, maybe on ValueSoft, right?
6353600	6358560	Yeah, yeah, digital is probably the better way to go.
6358560	6363000	So heads up to those folks that play games like City of Heroes, Champions Online and
6363000	6368800	Star Trek Online, which would be Dark Sakura, Cryptic Studios found out that their systems
6368800	6370560	have been hacked.
6370560	6371720	That's right.
6371720	6378840	They were hacked in December of 2010, about a year and a half ago, 16 months old when
6378840	6382640	this hacking issue went on and it was just discovered this week and an email went out
6382640	6385960	to everybody saying basically, LOL, we changed the passwords.
6385960	6388320	How did Cryptic find this 16 months later?
6388320	6390480	Through routine security checks and upgrades.
6390480	6392800	Of course, I'm thinking that's not very routine.
6392800	6397000	Is that the 16 month routine checkup?
6397000	6399040	Once every two years.
6399040	6403080	Account information, including passwords may have been accessed by an unauthorized party.
6403080	6405780	Of course, by now you probably would have had your account hacked.
6405780	6407440	Maybe that's how they got into the Xboxes.
6407440	6409040	No crap happened to my account.
6409040	6414120	Just letting people know I logged, I logged in and nothing, everything was still there.
6414120	6415320	So man, those hackers are good.
6415320	6417080	They turned Star Trek to free to play.
6417080	6419460	So I mean, they're pretty good.
6419460	6421560	So I spent an hour playing Dabo.
6421560	6426720	Yet another great tip to change your passwords and use unique passwords on every site.
6426720	6433960	And it says that your network provider checks their security logs more than once every 16
6433960	6434960	months.
6434960	6435960	All right.
6435960	6440640	And last but not least for my rapid fire news, Adam Sesser left G4.
6440640	6443360	Good for him.
6443360	6444360	You know what?
6444360	6449080	Hey, I understand you may joke, but you know what?
6449080	6454560	That guy, sadly, he was one of the good things from G4, not even G4, well, one of the good
6454560	6461320	things left on G4 and one of the good things from Tech TV back when they're around.
6461320	6466320	And you know, Bravo to him actually moving on to probably some better waters.
6466320	6471320	I mean, I don't know why the game blogs feel the need to continually cover G4.
6471320	6474600	G4 is not a gaming network and hasn't been for some time.
6474600	6475600	They're covering G4.
6475600	6476600	I think they're talking about Adam Sessler.
6476600	6481360	I don't think they care if a rat's ass about G4, I think they care about Adam Sessler.
6481360	6486720	I think that people are also curious- There's one response for that, Rob.
6486720	6488720	Did you kill a fly?
6488720	6494040	I think people maybe are hoping that he's going somewhere that will actually be gaming
6494040	6498240	related, but it is important to say, apparently it was a contract dispute that got him out
6498240	6503760	and you know, Comcast who owns G4, I'm sure wants to save money anywhere they can and
6503760	6509600	probably doesn't throw a lot of money at a network that some, you know, like didn't
6509600	6512200	DirecTV threaten to pull the plug on G4?
6512200	6513200	Maybe they already did?
6513200	6517440	Listen, we have enough cheater and cops reruns, we don't need you guys around here.
6517440	6523620	Honestly, G4 to me seems like a network that'd be better suited for the internet.
6523620	6524620	You know what I mean?
6524620	6529480	Just having like digital content on the internet because they don't have much content to begin
6529480	6530480	with.
6530480	6533440	It's literally cops and cheaters reruns all the fucking time.
6533440	6536480	The internet doesn't need them now, they have us.
6536480	6539520	And in fact, there's several folks in the chat room that say, Sessler should come to
6539520	6540520	vlog.
6540520	6542680	I, he is, the door is open.
6542680	6544640	I will, I would love to interview Adam Sessler.
6544640	6545640	We can't pay you though.
6545640	6547280	We'll pay him in Starbucks.
6547280	6548280	Exactly.
6548280	6553560	He will probably be getting less money than you were beginning with G4.
6553560	6555200	Some folks seem to think he could go to Polygon.
6555200	6559480	Again, this is all rampant speculation because you know, he just, I don't think he was planning
6559480	6560480	on leaving.
6560480	6563160	He thought the contracts would go through, but they didn't.
6563160	6568280	Polygon of course is that whole kind of Voltron of the guy who used to be the editor in Chiba
6568280	6573640	Kotaku and the like three editor guys from Joystiq and a bunch of people all coming together
6573640	6574640	for that one.
6574640	6575640	So.
6575640	6576640	Hmm.
6576640	6583880	Anyhow, uh, he's gone and G4 takes one more step away from gaming.
6583880	6584880	Moving on.
6584880	6585880	Dark Soccer.
6585880	6588900	Vel, moving, no we won't pay him in Pinkberry.
6588900	6589900	That Pinkberry's for us.
6589900	6590900	That's right.
6590900	6591900	I'm not giving up my Pinkberry.
6591900	6592900	Hell no.
6592900	6593900	I'm giving up my portion of Pinkberry.
6593900	6594900	You know what?
6594900	6595900	He can have the Peach Pinkberry.
6595900	6599720	He can have the Peach, all the Peach, and the Lychee shit when it comes back.
6599720	6600720	Oh yeah.
6600720	6602400	You can have the Lychee too.
6602400	6608860	So the Perpetual Testing Initiative DLC for Portal 2 will be available for PC and Mac
6608860	6615080	on May 8th and I'm downloading the shit out of it, but there's nothing saying about it
6615080	6617600	being on any of the consoles.
6617600	6618600	I second that.
6618600	6624720	I mean, I haven't redeemed my copy of Portal 2 for the PC on, um, my Steam thing that came
6624720	6625720	with the PS3.
6625720	6628520	You know, it might've had an expiration date, so you might want to look into that.
6628520	6629520	Damn it.
6629520	6630520	You better be careful.
6630520	6631520	Whatever.
6631520	6632520	Um.
6632520	6633840	It's like super cheap anyway now.
6633840	6634840	Yeah.
6634840	6640580	But I'm totally going to be writing a review on that when I download it because, you know,
6640580	6643880	my favorite thing to do in Sims, in Sims 3 was build houses.
6643880	6647920	Now I'll be building tests.
6647920	6649720	Would you like to play a game?
6649720	6650920	Oh God.
6650920	6656160	So, uh, for Dragon Quest fans, Dragon Quest X, um, which is the Wii...
6656160	6657160	Sorry.
6657160	6660520	I'm just imagining your dream OLR Studios level.
6660520	6663800	With Loki and I in a perpetual fall.
6663800	6664800	Oh my God.
6664800	6667800	You guys would be the perfect Atlas and Peabody.
6667800	6669160	That should be your cosplay as Atlas and Peabody.
6669160	6672760	I know who's Atlas.
6672760	6674040	Moving on.
6674040	6681640	So anyway, um, for Dragon Quest fans, Dragon Quest X, um, which is, uh, the MMO, uh, launching
6681640	6686420	in Japan on August 2nd, Squeenix has told everybody.
6686420	6694040	It will be for the actual disc is, um, 6980 yen, which is about 86 bucks and it's 20 days
6694040	6695120	of free play.
6695120	6701160	It will include a USB memory stick for an extra, uh, 2000 yen and, uh, like 23 bucks
6701160	6702160	here.
6702160	6706840	And, uh, there is going to be a Wii U version, but they have no details on this one.
6706840	6713820	The subscription fee is a thousand yen, basically a 1235 in US dollars.
6713820	6717400	And that's a 30 day voucher that gives you to play up to three characters.
6717400	6720880	Sixty days is 1950, 90 days will be 2,900.
6720880	6726480	So somebody was just asking the other day to square a while subscription is square.
6726480	6730640	Square Enix had any other MMOs and I forgot about this one, but yeah, Dragon Quest 10,
6730640	6731640	no news about it over here.
6731640	6734680	Maybe this is probably an E3 thing.
6734680	6735680	I don't know the American version.
6735680	6739600	I don't think the launch, you know, Dragon Quest is still a big thing here.
6739600	6741160	I understand it is in Japan.
6741160	6744800	It would be a big thing for launch, but I don't think it is not above square to talk
6744800	6747460	about games that are coming out three years from now at E3.
6747460	6748960	That is very true.
6748960	6752240	So Final Fantasy 13 versus, yes, yes, exactly.
6752240	6756860	I get to, Oh God, I hope, I hope versus makes the holiday this year.
6756860	6759680	I really want zero to come out over here.
6759680	6760680	Oh yeah.
6760680	6763080	Cause I want to play the hell out of that.
6763080	6770480	So how about my last bit for rapid fire news, Silent Hill Downpour.
6770480	6776500	There actually is a patch, there's two patch announcements, one for Silent Hill Downpour
6776500	6781040	and then we have Silent Hill HD Collection to fix the frame rate problems and audio syncing
6781040	6786860	and downpour and the auto save in the Silent Hill HD Collection and they should be coming
6786860	6795040	out and the quote is in the coming weeks, but, uh, there's no patch yet to make a Silent
6795040	6796040	Hill HD Collection.
6796040	6797040	Good.
6797040	6798040	Yeah.
6798040	6801360	We should spend a little bit more time on figuring out how fog works.
6801360	6805000	Fog is hard.
6805000	6808400	It's just like, come on Silent Hill.
6808400	6810320	Oh, the monsters don't work.
6810320	6812560	Well, let's just release it anyways.
6812560	6815960	I mean, that's about as integral as the fog.
6815960	6818000	The fog is kind of important there.
6818000	6820960	All right, let's go to the FUGL question of the week.
6820960	6823560	We've kind of missed this the past couple of weeks, so I think it's time we get to the
6823560	6824560	FUGL question.
6824560	6825720	I haven't missed it at all.
6825720	6826720	Why haven't you missed?
6826720	6827720	Are you, are you hating on the FUGL?
6827720	6828720	No.
6828720	6829720	I'm being a bitch.
6829720	6833320	Except, oops, I didn't have the FUGL theme song up tonight.
6833320	6834320	Shame on me.
6834320	6835320	Fail fired.
6835320	6838320	We're hiring Adam Sessler Robbed.
6838320	6839320	You guys would fire.
6839320	6841960	Exclusive Adam Sessler to replace Rob.
6841960	6842960	Here it is.
6842960	6843960	There it is.
6843960	6844960	FUGL.
6844960	6849280	Every week on our Facebook community and our Google Plus community, we ask a question and
6849280	6850280	get your answers.
6850280	6852400	Combine Facebook and Google and you get FUGL.
6852400	6854780	That's why it's our FUGL question of the week.
6854780	6859120	Now that Sony has announced their own Smash Brothers style game, should Microsoft start
6859120	6860560	working on one?
6860560	6864080	Why or why or why not wouldn't this be a good idea?
6864080	6866800	If you think it's a good idea, what character would you most want to see in the game?
6866800	6870320	We got one answer on Google Plus, so there are people using Google Plus.
6870320	6874440	Danny Kaye says, I don't really think they have enough first party games to justify a
6874440	6875440	game like that.
6875440	6876440	Ah, exactly.
6876440	6879400	That's a theme we're seeing quite a bit through some of the answers going over to Facebook
6879400	6884320	where we had lots of answers and I love this one from Bobby Blackwolf who posted a link
6884320	6890440	to a picture on a NeoGaf forum of what an Xbox Super Smash Brothers game would look
6890440	6899960	like and it's just a select screen for Xbox 360 Ultra Heroes Ultimate Fight and it's 15
6899960	6905680	different versions of Master Chief, all in different colors and shapes on the select
6905680	6906920	screen.
6906920	6913920	You know what this is missing though is the female Master Chief with a bow in her hair.
6913920	6917920	Mrs. Chief.
6917920	6922120	Katsuhiko Janai says, I don't want to play as Microsoft Bob or Clippy.
6922120	6926440	See, I like thinking, think outside the box, don't just make it the video games, make it
6926440	6927440	all the...
6927440	6928440	Clippy would be awesome.
6928440	6931680	I'm not thinking outside the Xbox.
6931680	6934560	Getting to kick the shit out of Clippy I think would sell...
6934560	6937360	Or the damn dog.
6937360	6938720	That ugly ass dog.
6938720	6943680	You know what character needs to be in the game Rob, seriously, Comic Sans so I can beat
6943680	6944680	the shit out of it.
6944680	6945680	All right.
6945680	6949600	Stan H says, I agree with Blackwolf, Microsoft doesn't have enough first party characters
6949600	6952080	to fill a decent sized roster for today's fighting game.
6952080	6956320	You need to have at least 15 and I can't think of anyone besides Master Chief and Milo unless
6956320	6961320	they have a Kinect that has legs and arms with boxing gloves on.
6961320	6963720	I know, that was funny.
6963720	6968880	James A says though, I must confess, I'd love to see Joanna Dark in such a game.
6968880	6969880	Cameo too.
6969880	6971720	So some folks are starting to think of some others.
6971720	6976320	Red the Haze says, no, even though Microsoft has a far more popular titles with characters
6976320	6980040	like Master Chief, they just don't have as much of a history to draw from like Sony or
6980040	6983240	Nintendo since they're relatively new to the console gaming business.
6983240	6987360	They have a few recognizable characters to choose from, they have Master Chief, Fable
6987360	6990080	Dude, Gears of War characters.
6990080	6994680	Another thing, most of the popular characters on the Xbox are from shooter games, throwing
6994680	6998200	characters from shooter games into a Smash Brothers type fighting might not go so well
6998200	7002280	with the Dude Bro gamers who are primarily in the Xbox shooters.
7002280	7005680	Though if they ever made one, I would love to see the President and Vice President from
7005680	7008960	Metal Wolf Chaos, that would totally change my mind.
7008960	7013760	Now I like what Jim H. said, they really, even if they don't, even if they can muster
7013760	7016400	up a roster, they really don't make those kinds of games.
7016400	7023360	Maybe an all-star shooter, so like an all-star melee rampage in first person.
7023360	7029680	Just call it like a Microsoft capture the flag, I don't know.
7029680	7030680	There you go.
7030680	7032820	Uh, let's see.
7032820	7035440	Now Gio Video goes a different way with this.
7035440	7039800	Well considering Nintendo was able to use Sonic and Snake, it doesn't have to be characters
7039800	7043280	exclusive to Microsoft, just characters they're willing to pay money for.
7043280	7048560	And since there are games like Metal Gear, Final Fantasy 13, Devil May Cry, that have
7048560	7052040	come into the Microsoft franchise, I can see them paying for the use of those characters
7052040	7054400	as well as Microsoft exclusives.
7054400	7058240	Also since it's Microsoft, perhaps a paper clip that fights with well-placed sarcastic
7058240	7060120	comments and uses itself like a sword.
7060120	7064920	You're also forgetting the fact that there's Xbox Live Arcade, there's plenty of shit on
7064920	7065920	Xbox Live Arcade.
7065920	7066920	That's true.
7066920	7072040	You can do Castle Crashers, you can have, you know, um, what was it, uh...
7072040	7073040	You know what's funny?
7073040	7074200	Tony B. said that.
7074200	7079560	Xbox Arcade characters swap out Master Chief for Bastion, Tim from Brave, Knights from Castle
7079560	7084240	Crashers, dude from Plants from Zombies, Splosion Man.
7084240	7085360	So there you go.
7085360	7090360	Uh, Orangewrite says Microsoft owns Rare, Rare has the Battletoads.
7090360	7091360	Think about it.
7091360	7094520	President Cat would not work by the way, Tigerclaw, because that...
7094520	7096720	Didn't Rare also do Killer Instinct?
7096720	7097720	Yes.
7097720	7099400	Oh, but Nintendo technically owns that.
7099400	7101960	I don't care, let's do a new Battletoads game.
7101960	7104400	Fuck any of this other shit, who gives a crap about this?
7104400	7106440	Battletoads is the devil.
7106440	7107440	I don't care.
7107440	7109040	That game's freaking hard.
7109040	7112240	Battletoads with like even more, more difficulty.
7112240	7115680	And then it had that like level music, the pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft
7115680	7116680	pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft
7116680	7126360	pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft
7126360	7143580	pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft p
7143580	7147640	twitter.com slash olr and Milo be terrible too because I have family
7147640	7153900	issues and I'm gonna shoot you in the face all right let's get back into some
7153900	7161880	other news Loki exclusive no I'm kidding so yes there there's a little bit of
7161880	7166980	talk about the next Smash Brothers game no we're not talking about PlayStation
7166980	7173160	one for the Wii U and the 3ds and one of the things that they're really pushing
7173160	7179040	for is cross support for those two platforms to be able to brawl against
7179040	7184620	each other of course you know who wouldn't want to do that it says
7184620	7188940	there's a certain dead end we can we come to if we just expand the volume of
7188940	7194100	the game us of course I intend to change the direction a little bit as we go the
7194100	7200260	key is that there's going to be its dual support for 3ds and Wii U so they're
7200260	7205860	gonna have some sort of you know cross play between the platforms which really
7205860	7210780	in this day and age is not that big a deal I mean the PSP and PlayStation 3 do
7210780	7218620	that the Vita and the PlayStation 3 do that not a huge deal it depends on how
7218620	7223140	like you know well integrated it is to you know well you know with that Wii U
7223140	7227060	controller being the bottom half of a 3ds I'm pretty sure that they'll be able
7227060	7231620	to pull it off I'm still excited about the next Smash Brothers it's a good
7231620	7235940	franchise yeah it'll be great to launch the next 3ds or the revision of the 3ds
7235940	7240900	it'll probably announce it oh don't give them ideas you jerk ideas they already
7240900	7246800	have ideas well nobody could call this idea that's for damn sure this game is
7246800	7253620	calling out idea either it's called NBA baller beats hey I thought you know
7253620	7258100	music game fans would enjoy this NBA baller beats it is being described as a
7258100	7262460	fun high-energy and first-of-its-kind participative the basketball video game
7262460	7267740	launching this fall exclusively on connect for the 360 you play this game
7267740	7276060	with an actual basketball in your living room it has licensed tracks from artists
7276060	7279860	like Kanye West run DMC gorillas hey there you go
7279860	7285620	common tiesto so and so much more apparently USA today got their hands on
7285620	7289660	the game and say it's a rhythm music game not like a dribbling coach like a
7289660	7293700	rhythm music game you bounce the ball to the beat of the music you have a visual
7293700	7297060	cue that's a line of basketballs on a musical trail and you have to do
7297060	7300620	specific moves like an icon might prepare you for an upcoming basketball
7300620	7304540	move also in time with the music you might have to cross over from one hand
7304540	7310980	to the other dribble between the legs do a pass fake or a shot fake it's creative
7310980	7314260	I got it to give it that but I'm like how in the fuck is this gonna work
7314260	7317860	because if you're playing it in your living room how do you bounce a ball on
7317860	7322060	your carpet I used to live in a house with hardwood floors but even then I
7322060	7326380	don't think my roommate would appreciate me playing this game well apparently
7326380	7330460	dribbling is going to be very close to the body because that's the way it is in
7330460	7336140	basketball they don't encourage you to dribble at the TV or whatever let's see
7336140	7342540	apparently it is possible to play baller beats in a carpeted room it will work
7342540	7347900	the ball will work on most services but that doesn't I guess shag rugs won't
7347900	7351060	work but the carpet should I don't know what the heck to take from that I feel
7351060	7355740	like I should say that's what she said but I I'm sorry it's just like this
7355740	7361180	sounds stupid I not that it's an I'll give them props to the fact that it's a
7361180	7365860	unique game idea now there's a little trailer here I've got it has been try
7365860	7370580	like this before but I think for good reason because it's stupid because it's
7370580	7375660	just I don't think this is gonna work well connect I think this is gonna be
7375660	7379320	annoying if you're in a goddamn apartment and also especially if you're
7379320	7385340	upstairs yes especially if you're upstairs and it's just I mean I was
7385340	7388980	looking in this trailer for clips of the game but I don't think I'm gonna see it
7388980	7395460	oh wait no there's a guy it's just him in the living room bouncing a ball but
7395460	7398900	he doesn't actually shoot the ball I mean you kind of care you fake shooting
7398900	7403220	it but which icons gonna indicate the you know me throwing the ball into the
7403220	7408580	TV because that's kind of you know a risk hopefully this thing is made out of
7408580	7414420	nerve because that's the only way you're gonna like not break your TV how many
7414420	7424580	lamps is this game gonna there's no in-game footage at all okay whatever I'm
7424580	7429060	sorry but like these games that come out for connect nobody can fucking take this
7429060	7433220	shit seriously they'd be honest Majesco hasn't really had a lot of games that
7433220	7436620	take the Kinect seriously I think the last game that they released for the
7436620	7448500	Kinect was the twister game twister for Kinect yeah no no this port this should
7448500	7453260	be an Xbox Live arcade game but it's not pork chocolate you can't get a little
7453260	7458460	nerfy ball from Xbox Live arcade nerfy derpy this will be on the aisle right
7458460	7463140	next to babysitting mama with the little wee baby that you shove the wiimote up
7463140	7468660	yet but that did well it's on sale at Target yeah it didn't cry pork chop and
7468660	7471780	chat says my ears are burning at the sound of this ass hattery and that's
7471780	7475420	pretty much what most people in the chat room boils down to you know I gotta
7475420	7481700	admit I as dumb as this sounds you guys I'm not gonna lie I kind of want to try
7481700	7488220	it just to say I did cuz it's not like any other Kinect game I've seen yet I
7488220	7493460	guess it's kind of a dance game at its core but if I could do the thing with
7493460	7500140	the ball like that guy hey I'd be fly I could get chicks Dark Sakura would buy
7500140	7512060	I'd be hot if I could dribble the ball you're becoming whiter knock it off all
7512060	7516060	right we're gonna go to the mailbag every week you guys send us emails they
7516060	7520580	don't and tell me about the things I shouldn't be doing no they don't mailbag
7520580	7526220	at orange lounge radio.com they really don't send anything we have one email
7526220	7530300	one email this week I guess everybody just just thought with the network
7530300	7535060	switch we wouldn't have time for emails I'm gonna hope that was it so this comes
7535060	7538620	from Robert M I was wondering whether Dark Sakura has had a chance to try the
7538620	7543460	pinball arcade either the is version or the latest console download although
7543460	7546980	video pinball simply can't really compete with the experience of real
7546980	7551100	physical tables what her overall impressions were actually I did download
7551100	7554540	it I haven't had a chance to play it yet I thought I talked about this on last
7554540	7559500	week or the week I have the iOS version yeah and I have I have literally not I
7559500	7564600	downloaded it that's it I played it on 360 it's um it's a faithful recreation
7564600	7569660	of the tables it's it really is just like the compilations they already put
7569660	7572460	out it's just this is kind of a different way of distributing it and I
7572460	7575940	think it's some different tables too I was thrilled to be able to play on
7575940	7580100	theater magic theater magic so one of the greatest tables ever I could try
7580100	7583380	loading it up so to be able to play that and Arabian Nights is that what the
7583380	7589100	table is actually called I have another name to it so I always remember this but
7589100	7593860	I love theater magic so to be able to play that again is great you know
7593860	7597100	there's things I like about pinball FX 2 and there's things I like about this
7597100	7602140	game certainly this game has the classic table feel to it and I get to play all
7602140	7606540	those old tables and kind of reminisce but I like that pinball FX has you know
7606540	7611540	Arabian tales of the Arabian Nights okay good Ripley's believe it or not black
7611540	7616460	hole I love black hole theater of magic bride of pin bot you know I used to have
7616460	7622620	that table hey bride of pinball wasn't on medieval madness yep there's one love
7622620	7626140	medieval more games on the iPhone they're on the Xbox unless I unless it's

7658500	7666340	Japanese it was my golden week tree anyway anyway whatever um it's as
7666340	7669780	incidentally as far as I'm concerned it would only be ironic if it was raining
7669780	7675020	during the wedding of a local weather reporter that's it oh I'm so glad we
7675020	7678500	held up the whole goddamn show to hear that you know what we have to read every

7699580	7704180	right moving on hey the dentist office is you know the pulse of the
7704180	7723740	entertainment community what a perfect time to segue into the F use of the week
7723740	7730060	a few to this thing for not letting me download this however the table pack is
7730060	7739860	like five bucks sucker yeah Loki if you the fact that I'm full there's more bread
7739860	7744020	sticks if you did the fact that I'll eat that knowledge guy I save room for
7744020	7750140	dinner actually I had a really fucking amazing week so I can't really say F you
7750140	7755260	today F you to the fact that I'm moving at work on Thursday it's not that you
7755260	7758740	know I'm you know I don't care about the whole reorg or whatever I think it's
7758740	7764140	gonna be interesting but the fact that I have to actually physically move meaning
7764140	7769700	pack up all my shit at my desk into a box let some other mover take it because
7769700	7776100	I'm a liability if I move it myself I don't want to move but hey at least the
7776100	7781740	new building has a gym hey at least you won't use it movers yeah they normally
7781740	7787140	I have to move my own shit Oh F you to the fact that I sound really lazy right
7787140	7793660	now that's really otherwise I had an amazing amazing week and I I really
7793660	7797460	can't wait I'm I want to talk more about what happened this week on next week's
7797460	7801180	show because I can't talk about it now but I'll talk about it next week all
7801180	7808820	right moving on let's get some more news Loki so this is kind of interesting it
7808820	7815620	leaked out on the PlayStation Network Store one of the PlayStation 1 classics
7815620	7821220	for the Vita it was actually in the European store Buzz Lightyear of Star
7821220	7830180	Command was the game it's been pulled so far but however it doesn't work yet it's
7830180	7835420	it's like it's missing a patch or something like that but apparently that
7835420	7840020	is a very good indicator that they're gonna be having some PlayStation 1 games
7840020	7843900	available very soon for the PlayStation Vita thank God I hope they all are
7843900	7847740	because that would be that would be a great library to just open my Vita to
7847740	7851900	you know Final Fantasy 7 hello yeah what else do I want Castlevania and now you're
7851900	7855300	getting some of these through ps2 Silent Hill the original yeah is free right
7855300	7859540	now on PlayStation Plus hopefully the plus stuff works on the Vita maybe they
7859540	7862580	have to get all that worked out I don't know but yeah I'm looking forward to
7862580	7867020	that that's gonna I know it sounds really weird that like you know it's
7867020	7871620	like oh I'm excited about old ass 15 year old games on my portable console
7871620	7876620	but you know I don't know I just there's a lot of stuff I have now that I didn't
7876620	7881340	when my PSP was all the rage and those screens are so big and crystal clear
7881340	7886020	like I'm it's most likely something they'll announce at e3 I think I gotta
7886020	7891180	wait that long and let I will only accept that if it's a one of those well
7891180	7896660	we're gonna be patching the PlayStation 1 titles into the Vita today you know
7896660	7900900	how sometimes there's that whole today announcement like what did Microsoft
7900900	7908460	have googly eyes on the Kinect today connect that was a googly eyes laser
7908460	7916020	pointer you know I liked it better some of that stuff was cute no no I liked it
7916020	7920940	better was that the second year we went to e3 2006 mm-hmm and they fucking had
7920940	7925020	hey listen you know what I know a lot of you people can't go to e3 so we're gonna
7925020	7929340	put some of those demos that are at e3 on your console that was fucking that
7929340	7933500	great that was great but they don't do that shit anymore they never do that
7933500	7937420	anymore it was like lost planet and I'd play this shit out of that demo over and
7937420	7941540	over again and MotoGP but I didn't give a shit about that but at least Capcom
7941540	7946820	got it once you know there I mean they should really do that again or as orange
7946820	7951020	right in the chat room says Saturn is coming out today things were different
7951020	7954460	back then though when the Saturn came out technology wasn't the way it is now
7954460	7957860	like I think if they were to do a system launch like that it would be a lot
7957860	7962500	different or at least like you know maybe not today but like it's coming out
7962500	7969540	next Friday that's like Apple yeah Apple does that works for them all right
7969540	7973340	anyhow uh well you just talked about one thing Capcom does right let me tell you
7973340	7978980	about something Capcom does very wrong oh that's a long the Megaman franchise
7978980	7984060	it is of note and I wanted to bring it up here on the show that the 100,000
7984060	7989820	strong for bringing back Megaman Legends 3 actually hit a hundred thousand
7989820	7995580	members this week I'm one of them yeah I think I am too so there you go and this
7995580	7999860	that is something that the million moms couldn't accomplish the 1 million moms
7999860	8005540	against Ellen or whatever dumbass hattery that stuff was so the hundred
8005540	8009940	thousand strong for Megaman Legends I liked they set a reasonable goal they
8009940	8015260	didn't say millions for a Megaman Legends they said a hundred thousand
8015260	8017820	strong for Megaman Legends because getting a million people in your
8017820	8021140	Facebook group that's reserved for things like Betty White hosting Saturday
8021140	8024460	Night Live and things like that that's you got to get one of those to get a
8024460	8029420	million a hundred thousand though is no small feat that's that's great
8029420	8032820	hundred thousand strong so important that if you are a member of the group
8032820	8037480	and you have not joined the dev room community at part of Capcom mm-hmm make
8037480	8040500	sure you do that because that's what Capcom is actually looking at assuming
8040500	8043980	that they're actually looking at something maybe this is gonna pressure
8043980	8050580	Capcom into an announcement this e3 we'll see well you fans you demanded it
8050580	8054500	so we're gonna finally port those games over that we've been promising oh I'm
8054500	8059580	sorry that's into Rama in our chat room says sky I know people on that group
8059580	8064380	they fucking occupied the Capcom booth at comic-con as hilarious as that
8064380	8069220	imagery is that's kind of messed up because the people at the booze manning
8069220	8072900	the floor especially at an event like comic-con probably aren't really the
8072900	8076940	decision-makers like yeah but the word will get back I guess that's true but I
8076940	8080380	don't know if that's exactly the best way to go about doing it to make a scene
8080380	8087580	like that but whatever different strokes for different folks I wonder if now
8087580	8092160	they're gonna release it and be all like because the fans demanded it this is the
8092160	8097980	fan game shit it worked for operation rainfall I go back go back two years ago
8097980	8100580	on this show and that whole operation rainfall thing first started we all sat
8100580	8104780	here saying hey chance in hell that's gonna work sorry guys look at what
8104780	8110220	happened earthbound yet it works we're having to eat our work it worked or game
8110220	8113020	stuff decided hey we're in a back well need to bring it over here and then
8113020	8116540	another publisher let's say last story let's say it worked for the last story
8116540	8119620	well last story was a different publisher Nintendo didn't have anything
8119620	8122620	well but it still worked somebody noticed that somebody put it out and
8122620	8125660	somebody took the risk that Nintendo wouldn't take and no one fucking
8125660	8129340	recognized president cat I mean seriously president cat there was a big
8129340	8134740	campaign behind it for a few weeks and then well I'm maybe president cat will
8134740	8138100	be a Wii U launch time perhaps we need a hundred thousand strong for president
8138100	8146860	can I think we had a good 50 on Twitter 50 period all right moving that's how
8146860	8151340	many copies of the game sold in Japan to apparently all right dark Sakura another
8151340	8157060	story please well there was a leak yeah I know everything I've talked about so
8157060	8164580	far has been leaks but there was video footage out for Rayman legends that was
8164580	8170340	a the Wii U version and it showed the how its graphical power the touchscreen
8170340	8174980	tablet and the near field communication basically it had everything on there and
8174980	8180220	then we had a statement put out by Ubisoft that said yeah this is real and
8180220	8185260	they're working on it at the Montpelier is that how it's pronounced studios
8185260	8190580	right now and basically they said that yeah it's not the final game don't use
8190580	8195480	that as representative but in fact here's actually what they're uh the
8195480	8199860	actual statement is I'll just read it an internal video showing images of Rayman
8199860	8204200	origin sequel what has leaked over the internet the video was intended as a
8204200	8208060	purely internal demonstrate demonstrative video and in no way
8208060	8211760	represents the final game the final console or their features the video was
8211760	8218260	destined for internal production teams who often create game prototypes with
8218260	8222140	work-in-progress development kits Ubisoft confirms the development of Rayman
8222140	8228100	legends handled by I guess that's Michelle Ancel and his team in Montpelier
8228100	8235860	so that's it well sucks for them that that got out but these things tend to
8235860	8238820	happen I don't know why you would create a sizzle reel for a different department
8238820	8244300	in your company we have a big company demos yeah I think it's more like
8244300	8248980	something that there's gonna show at e3 that kind of could be or it could have
8248980	8253860	been an early I mean maybe not the final cut so to speak I could see I have heard
8253860	8257620	it would be in case of keeping funding I have heard from people that I know that
8257620	8262180	work in development and so forth that they do sometimes these you know because
8262180	8265300	when you have these offices all over the place all over the world you do
8265300	8268940	sometimes have these pow-wows be it virtually or whatever where folks are
8268940	8272460	kind of like this is what we're working on this is what we're working on any
8272460	8276900	industry does this in my job it's called best practices I'm a trainer and my
8276900	8279380	training department gets together with other training departments we talk about
8279380	8282260	what's what's what are we doing right right now what can we learn from you
8282260	8286100	guys that's what we do I mean any big company does something like that it's
8286100	8291900	not a secret so I think this is just a part of that now they're gonna go with
8291900	8297220	other departments about not leaking your yes now that's the meeting that has to
8297220	8303380	be held next anyways as I was alluding to earlier in the show this is what's
8303380	8308260	wrong with the goddamn industry right there is this whole I'm assuming that
8308260	8314320	most people have seen the video and they're talking about you know the Wii U
8314320	8317900	integration and stuff like that which is cool you know the whole like oh one
8317900	8322020	person's on the Wii U tablet and they're you know moving the platforms or
8322020	8324180	whatever it's kind of like how they do it in a little big planet with like the
8324180	8329020	move support and the like the original thing although then your few near
8329020	8333900	field communication stuff scares me because that shit Skylanders all over
8333900	8337860	fucking again I mean it's like oh hey you want Rabbids world place the rabid
8337860	8342820	statue on the tablet oh you want to play it with Enzo place the Enzo statue on
8342820	8346420	the tablet oh you want hearts of the game place the heart session deposit 25
8346420	8350940	cents into your Wii U it's physical DLC is what that shit is and people are
8350940	8356460	fucking stupid and will buy the shit I want a statue of a rabbit and you've
8356460	8360020	suckered somebody in the purchasing a deep piece of DLC that would have been
8360020	8364900	$2 normally but it's a fucking cheap-ass statue that you're gonna pay $8 for not
8364900	8369620	gonna lie though if I could like get a cadence statue that would unlock an all
8369620	8374220	caden level in Mass Effect I would be all over that I would I would bow down
8374220	8380980	to that statue I love you game I'm just saying it it's Nintendo's tried this
8380980	8385440	with you know fucking AR cards with Kid Icarus if they're just experimenting
8385440	8389540	with this because they saw how successful Skyler's was and Skylanders
8389540	8394580	was a franchise that doesn't really exist it has Spyro in it but fuck it's
8394580	8398660	not really Spyro anymore and it's not really a Spyro franchise but it's the
8398660	8403260	brand-new franchise that with no backing and they sold toys and people were like
8403260	8407140	oh my god I need this toy even though it's like what the fuck is this toy I
8407140	8412980	mean it's just this new thing but can you imagine if fucking Mario did that if
8412980	8416340	there was a Mario game with a bunch of fucking statues it's a get you know
8416340	8420020	franchise with an established fan base already and then you're selling all this
8420020	8426380	cool shit on top of it that people oh I got to have this stuff or Pokemon oh I
8426380	8430460	need all the Pokemon statues so I can unlock them in game can you imagine and
8430460	8434980	I know you probably thinking oh that's ridiculous no it's not it's fucking in a
8434980	8440100	couple years time is what's gonna happen and then it's gonna get fucking
8440100	8445340	ridiculous Ross deal UT in the vog network chat room says calm down Loki
8445340	8448420	they're gonna be cash-ins for this you're not gonna see this take off
8448420	8455340	long-term act-def says Nintendo already did this with the e-reader but I don't
8455340	8459420	think the e-reader necessarily took off it was a neat idea and I I think it was
8459420	8463020	a great idea with some of like the stuff they did for Animal Crossing and stuff
8463020	8467180	but I mean I was a little different unlocking the Legend of Zelda or Super
8467180	8471100	Mario Brothers in a game is pretty cool compared to like you know and how much
8471100	8475380	were those cards they weren't them expensive man the old-school Animal
8475380	8479620	Crossing on the GameCube did it the best with the whole like old games oh man
8479620	8484660	that's such a deal that Nintendo wants you to forget ever happened all right
8484660	8489100	so I I got to share this funny comment from Shane cuz I was talking about the
8489100	8494420	cadence statues so Shane's in our chat room at the vog network calm oh excuse
8494420	8498380	me vog network calm I almost said the old chair who somebody everybody in
8498380	8501660	chats waiting for one of us to fuck up tonight and say something old
8501660	8506420	Shane says I would buy all those statues talking about the cadence statues all up
8506420	8512940	before you could even see one Rob can I tell you a funny story about Shane we
8512940	8518380	were talking in the car while I was on my way I this week I drove to LA at
8518380	8524260	midnight I drove to LA from midnight to 5 a.m. I had Victoria with me but I had
8524260	8527820	to drive to stock to the Stockton area to pick Victoria up from Sacramento she
8527820	8530160	lives in a town called Livermore for those of you guys familiar with
8530160	8532880	California so it's about an hour and a half away from where I'm at so I'm
8532880	8535700	driving down there about 10 o'clock at night and I call Shane on the road just
8535700	8538420	you know I'm like Shane entertain me so he's talking about I'm trying to pick
8538420	8542580	out a new gamertag and I can't think of I can't think of what gamertag to pick
8542580	8545020	out cuz I want a new gamertag and I asked him if I could share this with you
8545020	8549820	guys and I said well Shane you need to just put something you really love in
8549820	8554620	your gamertag he's like I can't get Caden everything everything Caden is
8554620	8560380	taken I said why don't you make your gamertag Shane a lingo like you've
8560380	8563620	married cuz Caden's name is a lingo I said why don't you make your gamertag
8563620	8567660	Shane a lingo and he's like I'm gonna do that yes and he changed his gamertag so
8567660	8577340	he's now Shane a lingo he took Caden's name what Cadence no that doesn't work
8577660	8583540	all right anyhow there it is that was your random tangent story hey two more
8583540	8586940	stories which is a lot more interesting than your grocery store dance thank you
8586940	8591380	thank you shut up all right two more stories and then Twitter and Skype well
8591380	8597620	this is an unusual chain of events apparently Nexon is looking to take
8597620	8605460	over EA they're actually bidding to buy EA apparently they're really big in South
8605460	8610580	Korea and they have a lot of money I don't think that they're actually gonna
8610580	8619540	take them over but it's interesting that they're trying it's kind of funny that
8619540	8624340	somebody's like trying to take on EA but everybody's laughing kind of pointing
8624340	8627260	laughing that's going how cute and you're just waiting for it to flip the
8627260	8636300	other way why don't we buy you always a bigger fish who do you think could buy
8636300	8643140	EA if anyone Microsoft Sony I guess I mean who's bigger than EA at this point
8643140	8646660	in the gaming why would they want to like a Viacom or something like that to
8646660	8650740	stop EA from all this multi-platform online stuff they're trying to do and
8650740	8655140	lock EA and all their games into one particular system I can't imagine
8655140	8660660	Microsoft event key oh yeah hey sports games we have them no one else says
8660660	8666540	Facebook is gonna pay 1 billion dollars for Instagram surely there's a way if
8666540	8671860	Microsoft wants it bad enough they could snap up EA and every every EA exclusive
8671860	8677380	is now Microsoft exclusive including the sports franchises Mass Effect Dragon Age
8677380	8680140	I'm thinking of all the Bioware stuff is this the stuff I like but you know all
8680140	8686740	the battlefield battlefield I mean but because of that EA probably just cost
8686740	8693340	too damn much yeah team Ron in our chat room says Ted Turner should buy EA Ted
8693340	8699140	Turner actually they tried to do gaming Turner was game tap turn the Turner
8699140	8702500	Network stuff started game tap back in the day back when game tap was alright
8702500	8706140	game tap was really interesting when it finally they could come back if they
8706140	8709380	really yeah I kind of went to crap since the beginning like it just now it just
8709380	8712100	blends in with the rest when it had kind of like its own player and they were
8712100	8715700	talking about like the desktop stuff and all that and had its own launcher it was
8715700	8719740	really neat looking now it's just it just looks like any other it just it
8719740	8722500	blends right in with everything else like what game flies doing and all that
8722500	8727780	other stuff so and plus for a while game tap was like the only place you could
8727780	8730780	play missed online some of that other stuff you should come out with the
8730780	8735420	console it'll be a PC from like ten years ago they'll the old stuff maybe
8735420	8740860	who knows hey what do we do these old PCs they kind of I've got an idea don't
8740860	8746580	you see that happen with the NES stuff like you see those are the the oh yeah
8746580	8751660	like you know 101 built into the NES because all the patents on the old NES
8751660	8756300	stuff is expired the actual hardware pirates don't give a fuck yeah exactly
8756300	8760100	well and Nintendo doesn't really protect it very well either I don't know if they
8760100	8766620	can't or what the deal is but let's see DJ Dark Knight in our chair and says
8766620	8771940	totally forgot about game tap lol yeah that's game taps problem they used to
8771940	8775860	have really funny commercials and the reason why was because they had Turner
8775860	8781980	Network behind them so they had the the ability to do some fun TV stuff sake in
8781980	8787180	our chat room hi sake says yep game tap resurrected missed online or ooh was the
8787180	8791860	name of that I did I missed online was creepy this is kind of a creepy game to
8791860	8795540	me by the way since I say eggs and chat I should say everybody check out walking
8795540	8800020	dead just came out I think say would appreciate me throwing that out there
8800020	8804140	all right one more story for you guys and then the skype line at one eight
8804140	8811740	seven seven game olr or our username on skype orange lounge radio this is a new
8811740	8818700	story about an old game that's new again what do I mean by that well 30 years
8818700	8823140	after the fact something that was supposed to be impossible has finally
8823140	8830100	happened the game star castle has been condensed onto an Atari 2600 cartridge
8830100	8836780	that's right remember the game star castle nope well somebody does I actually
8836780	8839580	I think it was a pretty big game in the 80s but because it never had a home port
8839580	8843300	I think a lot of people forgot it well what's interesting Howard Scott Warshaw
8843300	8848060	who made you know yards revenge et love him or hate him he made some great games
8848060	8853540	and some bad games on the Atari 2600 he said star castle could never be stuffed
8853540	8857260	into a game cartridge that's why they never did it because they just there was
8857260	8861700	no way they could have done it in 8k well Scott Williamson who was one of
8861700	8864500	these guys back in the day that was doing stuff for the 2600 he never
8864500	8870220	believed it so here we are 30 years later I love this this is like something
8870220	8876580	Loki would do don't you ever tell me I can't do something because damn it
8876580	8883380	someday I'm gonna fucking do it here we are 30 years later and Scott Williamson
8883380	8889580	achieved it he got star castle down into a format for the Atari 2600 he is now
8889580	8893820	the technical director at development studio high voltage what I think is
8893820	8899020	really cool though they made this custom cartridge and I actually really love
8899020	8902540	this there's a great YouTube where you can check this out the frickin cartridge
8902540	8907980	lights up they built these little lights into the cartridge so that as you're
8907980	8911180	playing it I'm trying to get to like a part where you see it in the video here
8911180	8914300	because I don't want to play the whole like two and a half minute video it's
8914300	8918940	pretty cool yeah oh yeah the game looks great but there's a part in it where you
8918940	8922820	actually see the little cartridge is like lighting up with the game it's
8922820	8926060	technology like at the time oh my god can you imagine if somebody had done
8926060	8930900	this when Atari 2600 was like new yeah oh there it is here look at this part
8930900	8936860	here in the video see like it's lighting up with the game and you can actually
8936860	8941140	buy that cartridge you can and if you want to get a copy of the cartridge you
8941140	8943940	know they're trying to fund an effort right now to get that cartridge made
8943940	8947380	they want to make a lot of these and sell these so where does everybody go
8947380	8952500	and they need money fast in this day and age kick-farter that's right it's a kick
8952500	8959380	farter so if you go to Kickstarter it's the Atari 2600 star castle I gotta say
8959380	8965260	this one's I I like this better than a lot of the ones I've read the goal is
8965260	8969940	reasonable $10,000 and $10,000 they've already met it with 24 days to go
8969940	8973940	they're already at $14,000 and if you want to get a copy of the cartridge I
8973940	8978780	think it's $50 or more yeah yeah pledge $50 you get the clear cast acrylic star
8978780	8983300	castle cartridge featuring lights that flash with the game action serial number
8983300	8988140	and and so forth that's one of the few that I can get behind I mean it sounds
8988140	8993220	pretty cool just for the fact that I'd be buying the actual cartridge I am
8993220	8996660	forever more they're going to refer to those things as kick-farters that's a
8996660	9002260	great name I am so against them except if they give me money I don't know man
9002260	9007180	I I've contributed to two and both are pretty good video game high school and
9007180	9012740	shadowrun because I like me some shadowrun and Freddie Wong man whatever
9012740	9019220	whatever he makes it wants money for I'll pay for it all right I think that's
9019220	9022700	about the time where we're gonna open up the skype line die oh yeah I have Skype
9022700	9027340	open I just had us on D&D so let me unlock that there and we're gonna cast
9027340	9034420	magic missile it's open it's on D&D right one do not disturb 1 8 7 you're a
9034420	9040180	little disturbing all right oh you have a last minute story go for it I was
9040180	9045260	interested in awesomenauts it turns out that their publisher DTP entertainment
9045260	9049040	filed for as they say overseas insolvency which is pretty much the
9049040	9056660	equivalent of bankruptcy so it may not make them a second really state but um
9056660	9060980	Romano games which is the developers really trying to work on getting it out
9060980	9065420	so so I'm looking at our chat room at chat owners on traded calm I noticed
9065420	9069020	sake is suddenly getting an impromptu interview in the chat room because
9069020	9071660	people are like saying did you work on walking dead that was awesome because
9071660	9074940	apparently walk I have not played it myself yet because I haven't watched the
9074940	9078380	show although I understand the game is based off the books I do still want to
9078380	9082020	check it out because I hear it's really good everybody's really loving the game
9082020	9087820	so sake is giving an impromptu interview at vog network calm and I want to
9087820	9091540	mention what Blackwell says in the chat room $50 is about how much you'd be
9091540	9095580	paying for a custom 2600 cartridge anyway so that's a decent price I paid
9095580	9101340	40 bucks for halo 2600 somebody actually did halo 2600 all right mm-hmm let's go
9101340	9105820	to the phones hi you are on orange launch radio who's this this is Shane
9105820	9112660	also known as Shane Alenko thanks to you hey Shane what's up um nothing I'm just
9112660	9117260	playing the wild bay that's night oh I'm bored you're just calling to say hey
9117260	9125020	no actually I was thinking about stuff but yes I decided to call said stuff you
9125020	9131540	can hear more about the Wow beta on best little horde house in Azeroth at www.hordehouse.com
9131540	9137300	we have nothing to say about horde house and vog yet but we'll see so
9137300	9141300	anyway Shane what did you really want to call it about um I was thinking about
9141300	9146480	those rumors of the midnight purple 3ds since it's popping up all over the place
9146480	9151580	on a room like online sites it's not a rumor they have a picture of it well
9151580	9156380	because it was 83 as one of the concept colors a long time ago I wasn't well it
9156380	9161340	might not be that specific color it could be slightly changed do I if that
9161340	9167380	if if that color comes out that will be the first time I will ever as I call it
9167380	9175420	quote pull a Shane and buy a $250 system just because it's in a nice new color
9175420	9180220	I will I'm gonna upgrade if that's the case because I can't tell the difference
9180220	9186100	between blue and purple so to me it's a new blue system for me I'm really happy
9186100	9191860	with that but wouldn't that make it all the less I don't know likely they would
9191860	9196940	announce a redesign at e3 for the 3ds no no because they were still releasing
9196940	9200820	even after the DSI XL came out they released the DSI and like pretty pink
9200820	9206460	and all this stuff so not necessarily plus I it may still be too soon this
9206460	9211260	year still may be too soon for the redesign the 3ds is only a year old I
9211260	9214100	see this is the kind of thing that's in a two-year cycle and also because
9214100	9217020	they're trying to make sure that they're not losing more money on they're adding
9217020	9221140	more components to a system might not be a good idea yeah this year is about the
9221140	9224780	Wii U I don't think I mean certainly they still want people to buy the 3ds
9224780	9229380	but I don't do a 3ds XL with the extra add-on built in I just don't think they
9229380	9233820	would do a 3ds XL or whatever and owe the Wii U in the same year I think this
9233820	9238020	year will be the Wii U next year will be their 3ds redesign year after that
9238020	9243140	something some huge add-on for the Wii U or something okay then what about this
9243140	9248940	what game are they going to launch that makes that color make sense what purple
9248940	9253780	yeah because they tend to launch games that kind of fit with the new color
9253780	9260660	schemes like they had in Japan they had the Fire Emblem blue they've had stuff
9260660	9265940	similar to that I don't know I can't think my Pokemon purple no Luigi's
9265940	9272300	Mansion 2 or Animal Crossing while Luigi takes over the world because he was
9272300	9277420	purple right yeah maybe he's in crappy Luigi's Mansion 2 very hopefully is
9277420	9283020	better than that e3 demo I played there you go or what else what else is purple
9283020	9290540	Barney the Barney the dinosaur he's coming back you know well maybe maybe
9290540	9293980	the license on Barney now that it's been 20 years is so cheap maybe somebody else
9293980	9297820	is licensed them and now we can finally get our Barney killer game Barney
9297820	9304620	sniper so 90s already Barney 20 years after nobody hold on hold on hold on are
9304620	9308580	you all sitting here and telling me that if some company released a game called
9308580	9312660	birthday party Barney sniper you would not be the least bit interest no I would
9312660	9316940	not be actually no I am so over that excuse me excuse me
9316940	9321060	Shane this whole wood cars about life if you try should we be like talk to the
9321060	9325620	hand because that's another stupid 90s reference no excuse me because what are
9325620	9329380	you talking about no one cares about stuff in the 90s with your Power Rangers
9329380	9334100	obsession different because that's not different you know what came on after
9334100	9339900	Barney Power Rangers I think if it's fair to share or repeat something again
9339900	9344740	but they are doing a Power Rangers samurai connect game they'll be coming
9344740	9348140	I told people at work that also care about Power Rangers and they all freaked
9348140	9353180	out about that just like I did so that worked there at least before people that
9353180	9359540	buy that game well there you go and that's all the copies that will sell
9359540	9362820	that's more people than bought president cat in Japan all right
9362820	9367140	Shane what else anything else you want to share with us tonight or ask about or
9367140	9372820	whatever I don't know my I hurts oh no but here let me ask you about this since
9372820	9377060	you're the guy that always likes to talk about Mass Effect yes I am um what did
9377060	9380540	you think about my little negative aspect of Mass Effect 3 some people in
9380540	9384300	the chat room didn't take too well to that I wait what was you know say it one
9384300	9388800	more time for me because I don't know if I fully grasp what I don't like tension
9388800	9394060	that it's not that I hate that you have to play multiplayer in order to do
9394060	9397900	better in single-player especially in light of the whole iOS thing but I
9397900	9401300	really hate that a it's the easiest way to do it and B what really pisses me off
9401300	9405220	is the fact that you can buy those little boxes with Microsoft points as
9405220	9409420	well as in-game credits because to me that's trying to it's trying to have
9409420	9414280	your cake and eat it too you're trying to do a free Facebook game and charge me
9414280	9420020	$60 for the game up front I didn't like about I don't really agree with your
9420020	9427100	negativity because a if there are people that want to pay real money to unlock
9427100	9432420	extra guns or extra customization on their characters instead of just playing
9432420	9436540	through the modes like you should let them they're not making me pay for it so
9436540	9439700	I don't really care I'm saying please don't do it because you're encouraging
9439700	9443060	him to do it in other stuff and more often I just I think it's a bad
9443060	9447220	precedent is that if these people don't do it someone else will it's already out
9447220	9450580	there with like you know it's half out there rather with like all those
9450580	9454380	Facebook games oh I could play there's a um that you don't know Jack game
9454380	9458060	apparently on Facebook is in beta and it's apparently really fun but you only
9458060	9462820	get like five games per day and they're really short unless you buy you know
9462820	9466940	credits or something wait a minute you don't know Jack is on Facebook it's in
9466940	9471380	beta right now I know what I'm doing after the show or has it I knew what I'm
9471380	9474860	doing after the show nope you have to sign up for the beta I haven't got in
9474860	9479260	since I damn it up yet yes I know I once I heard about I was like sign me up
9479260	9488780	really quick but to even if there wasn't an iOS game to help you raise your
9488780	9493660	galactic readiness level like I hated the idea of having to play multiplayer
9493660	9499500	just to get a quote-unquote better ending because they all suck but like
9499500	9503340	the multiplayer is so enjoyable and you don't have to listen to other people if
9503340	9506380	you don't want to and you just run around I'm terrible at the Xbox when I
9506380	9510380	get killed all the time but I don't care I'm still having a blast playing it so I
9510380	9515460	think if it was a multiplayer that sucked yeah then boo to that but they
9515460	9520220	did a really good job and I don't think it's that big of an issue that you
9520220	9524140	should play multiplayer to have a better ending because you can take those
9524140	9528340	characters and use them as I think war assets once they hit 20 or something
9528340	9532080	like that and speaking of which since you brought it up I believe after the
9532080	9535860	show tonight we're gonna be playing some Mass Effect online right yes we are did
9535860	9538860	you did you get people can join us did you get some I thought you were in try
9538860	9543060	and recruit somebody to play with us nope can't play tonight that person so
9543060	9547920	you need to you need to send out like some sort of whatever you call it all
9547920	9554300	right get on Xbox hold on show Mass Effect 3 meet up there you go yes all

9599500	9604740	oh well it was fun trying well I doubt it you guys do a pretty good job anyway
9604740	9608460	you know this is important to say when we started orange launch radio in the
9608460	9613860	old network I think you can you know I can't say this enough we did orange
9613860	9619180	launch radio for 12 people for a very long time you know and a lot of people
9619180	9622220	really didn't know about us and it's not like we have thousands of thousands of
9622220	9626380	listeners now it's relatively still a really small show but we're okay with
9626380	9630020	that you know we feel like we're really connected with our community and it's
9630020	9635220	it's cool I like it suppose it's very dedicated kind of community as well so I
9635220	9641420	mean I like this and so I guess you got me staying up till all hours so well
9641420	9645500	that is a great I'm not too much because I can't talk over you all the time so
9645500	9648820	that's right I was just gonna say when you sacrifice the greatness that is
9648820	9653540	sleep to listen to this show we take it as a great compliment but anyway what
9653540	9657060	did you want to talk to our talk about or ask us about tonight I wanted to
9657060	9660440	mention remember you're talking about six axes one of the games that was
9660440	9664220	pretty overlooked I don't know if many people bought it was loco roko I remember
9664220	9668820	buying that on PSN and I played the shit out of that I mean on PSP it was okay
9668820	9673260	but you know you could actually control everything with the six axis you could
9673260	9677820	rotate the screen you could turn everything around and stuff so I mean
9677820	9682500	that was one of the best ones I think I did was that a gun that went off in the
9682500	9693100	background it was my Android okay I'm actually talking okay it was a duck
9693100	9698660	quite they have ducks over there no loco roko is is pretty awesome you're
9698660	9701900	right I forgot about loco roko and that's a good one to remind us of does
9701900	9705780	this mean hey does this mean loco roko needs to show up in the Sony Super
9705780	9713540	Battle Royale a loco roko level that's a good idea that I want them yes that
9713540	9718900	would be hilarious you're actually able to flip the screen somehow oh everyone
9718900	9722900	on their heads do pork chops should be designing games I love that idea the
9722900	9726900	whole like flip the screen like get a power-up that does that oh that'd be
9726900	9731420	awesome sorry be awesome well pork chop are you looking forward to the super
9731420	9735900	Sony fighter or whatever it's called I'm in two minds about it I mean this the
9735900	9739500	first I've heard of it was tonight so I'm still thinking about it I'm
9739500	9742740	wondering is it gonna be worthwhile I mean it's not gonna be Super Smash
9742740	9746860	Brothers that was fun and again I mean as long as Microsoft don't try it I mean
9746860	9752020	that's gonna be an all-time piece of shit if you ask me it's just gonna be 12
9752020	9757820	Master Chief's as it was said in chat so well we'll see we'll see what happens
9757820	9760820	all right pork chop is there anything else you want to share with us tonight

9814020	9819220	exciting for both yeah I mean I just hope that all games looking go the
9819220	9824900	direction of g4 no I can tell you know what I I think I can safely say no there
9824900	9828740	I am fairly certain they have no interest in rerunning cheaters or cops
9828740	9834140	yes I from what I understand there's some other great gaming and gaming
9834140	9838860	related programming coming over there that that'll be great and you know that's
9838860	9846060	I'll be I'll be listening when I can it'll be interesting hey I'm just on a
9846060	9849540	technical note notice I've been getting some feedback when I'm talking I've been
9849540	9854340	hearing like pieces of myself you might yeah because in studio here we're too
9854340	9857180	cheap to have headsets for everybody so we actually play the calls over the
9857180	9861020	speaker so sometimes you get picked up just a little bit by our microphones so
9861020	9865540	sometimes our callers complain of that so apologies about that but you know one
9865540	9869500	of these days we'll have to go I don't know sell things on the side of the
9869500	9873320	freeway to get money for proper headphones for everybody actually that
9873320	9876220	was something I thought about doing for the studio but just never got around to
9876220	9882020	it but anyway I do yeah that might be a good idea I mean it's not like I get
9882020	9885620	office headsets or something well the good news is it's only you that has to
9885620	9891000	hear it are the over the radio it sounds fine and so I kind of go okay well one
9891000	9894660	person can suffer a little bit so all the others listening can hear it okay so
9894660	9903780	I apologize so games what's up what games you've been playing lately or was
9903780	9907620	there game news you want to mention tonight well lately I've been playing a
9907620	9912900	lot of Soul Caliber five Soul Caliber five yeah one of our listeners and I
9912900	9916060	were trying to meet up to play and it just wasn't working out for various
9916060	9921300	reasons but man some of the custom creations and I think he posted some of
9921300	9925980	them on Facebook Stan posted it on Facebook it's it's hilarious what people
9925980	9929500	are doing with those custom characters it's so robust but yeah so Caliber five
9929500	9934740	yeah time oh yeah I saw this one video on YouTube it was a Waldo player uh-huh
9934740	9940060	and and he made this character based off of Waldo with a huge purple furry
9940060	9948540	palace because and I got the episode yeah it's the only like and sorry I was
9948540	9951700	just gonna say something go ahead that's right it's old classic saying that we
9951700	9955740	say about video games it's called time to penis whenever something new comes
9955740	9959860	as the TTP the time to penis whenever something new comes out where there's
9959860	9964100	either a peripheral so for a peripheral it's how long till someone puts their
9964100	9968660	dick on it but then with these creative modes and custom things it's how long
9968660	9974500	till someone makes a dick and the answer is usually 0.5 seconds oh yeah it was
9974500	9977860	not long at all I think the YouTube video was like from February so it's
9977860	9980660	like very soon after the game came out it's not long at all that's what she
9980660	9989940	said I mean the thing that I'm sorry I'm laughing a bit but um the thing that's
9989940	9994620	got me about um instead of been playing a lot of phone caliber is that you know
9994620	9999500	it's very hard to define you know fighting coverage that isn't really
9999500	10004260	centered around Capcom you know it's gotten to the point where I don't know
10004260	10007860	if you follow tournaments at all but it really feels like you know a lot of the
10007860	10012700	players are forcing themselves with them with Street Fighter cross second because
10012700	10016260	you know playing the Capcom game seems to be the only game way to get any
10016260	10022060	coverage interesting so you think Namco is getting well I mean I guess maybe not
10022060	10025020	because Namco is kind of the other half of Street Fighter cross tech and
10025020	10031260	although technically it's a Capcom game what about what about Mortal Kombat are
10031260	10034140	people not taking that seriously I mean Mortal Kombat I thought was a pretty
10034140	10038340	good fighting game but I guess it is the thing is people people play these games
10038340	10043780	seriously I mean maybe not as much if there are a lot of people I mean um you
10043780	10047340	know so kind of a five in Mortal Kombat 9 are part of the games being featured
10047340	10052340	in major league gaming now but you know it's hard to find coverage if it's not a
10052340	10057460	bypass on game so it's hard to find you know people talking about it people you
10057460	10060420	know any sort of cup you know any sort of coverage of the events of things like
10060420	10064660	that why do you think that is you know the as you're saying that you're kind of
10064660	10067900	right whenever I hear about fighting game community it does seem like Capcom
10067900	10072060	first other games second I mean granted there are other games like Stan says
10072060	10075220	King of Fighters which is another good one to you know Soul Calibur as was
10075220	10077820	mentioned it's not like there's not other good fighting games out there but
10077820	10080420	you're kind of right whenever I hear about like fighting game tournaments and
10080420	10083860	who's popular it's always Street Fighter something that it comes down to why is
10083860	10089940	that why do you think that is I mean it's hard hell I mean obviously part of
10089940	10094380	it is because you know one of the first big fighting games was Street Fighter 2
10094380	10100860	I mean that that's the jump off for a lot of players true but I think at this
10100860	10107700	point you have a you have a lot of major sites that really they didn't know it's
10107700	10111260	like anything else they don't want to go out of their wheelhouse and it and it's
10111260	10114780	kind of frustrating we have to dig around for for science but for other
10114780	10119820	games I have to tell you though my experience was a lot different when I
10119820	10125900	was you know teenager and young adult in Alabama it was all Mortal Kombat 2 it was
10125900	10130500	well because the blood was cool well no it when we did our tournaments at my
10130500	10133940	college it was on Killer Instinct we didn't have any Street Fighter machines
10133940	10137540	we had a we had a vampire save that would also be the period of time though
10137540	10139980	when all the Street Fighter games that were coming out were essentially just
10139980	10143900	Street Fighter 2 champions we've had her to churbo Street Fighter 2 super and
10143900	10148900	then there was Street Fighter 3 which kind of I mean it was it didn't have
10148900	10152700	that same fire under it when it came out but like even my arcade that I worked
10152700	10155860	out later than that it was Tekken 3 but then again we were also in Amco arcade
10155860	10162460	hmm I'm just saying well I haven't been to a Street Fighter tournament yeah it's
10162460	10169060	funny to hear that because um like I like the way the way the way it's
10169060	10171820	presented to me and the way I remember from my own youth is that everybody
10171820	10176540	gravitated to Street Fighter you know and and it needs to continue that might
10176540	10181180	be more of a West Coast thing and it is well it is also I I think if you look at
10181180	10183780	the internet and a lot of stuff like a lot of the fighting game stuff on the
10183780	10187220	internet I I don't doubt what right steel is saying at all it does seem to
10187220	10191460	be heavily dominated with Street Fighter especially the eSports stuff all this
10191460	10194500	stuff we're talking about that didn't exist in the area you're talking about
10194500	10199660	eSports wasn't a thing back then you know so now that it's even even even
10199660	10203940	before eSports like when Mortal Kombat came out I remember a lot of people
10203940	10209060	didn't take it seriously and and the post arcade Mortal Kombat they never got
10209060	10213100	any tournament play well even though they were popular game Mortal Kombat 3
10213100	10216620	is like Mortal Kombat 3 especially was kind of a joke in the fighting game
10216620	10219900	community because of all the not just the over-the-top stuff but the combos
10219900	10224060	and the the the juggles that go on forever and just kind of the style is so
10224060	10227380	much different I remember that game was really not well received by the fighting
10227380	10232580	game community you know casual people liked it enough but it's funny you say
10232580	10237640	that because because a lot of people you mean that they're huge into the into
10237640	10242620	Marvel you know and that's all you know that's all bullshit juggles and 99 hit
10242620	10246660	combos that's true all right Ross still I gotta let you know I gotta let you go
10246660	10249860	for time but thank you so much for calling in I really appreciate it okay
10249860	10254140	all right take care buddy all right that's gonna do it for the

10291780	10299020	assuming it's the geek life one because that's the article we've been we haven't
10299020	10302820	we haven't taken new publicity photos in at least like six years cuz that was at
10302820	10308140	my like old house so yeah took those pictures no Eddie that was from the

10316300	10321460	that yeah no I loved it but anyway it was awful I thought you look cute but
10321460	10324980	we need new ones we need to find a photographer friend maybe I know a
10324980	10330180	couple get some new ones taken and you can see how you can see how cute Loki
10330180	10336780	is now it depends on what day you see me like right now I need a haircut and a
10336780	10344020	shave all right going to a couple tweets from Tiger claw on Twitter says trials
10344020	10350300	evolution popularity is due to true skill according to red links trials
10350300	10354660	evolution of course is on the Xbox Live arcade and it set a one-day sales
10354660	10359340	record apparently because of how well trials HD had done this is the game
10359340	10364020	that's like kinda excite by the bike II at least that's what it is at first look
10364020	10370780	let's see what is why why are people loving this so much according to Taro
10370780	10375140	virtually who's the managing director at red links I think there is a more
10375140	10379140	positive explanation than sheer masochism it's like in real life when you
10379140	10382540	start practicing something very physics based like tennis or billiards there's
10382540	10386740	no limit how far you can develop your skills in trials is also about your own
10386740	10391300	true skill not the skill of your avatar or game character the sense of
10391300	10395060	accomplishment is that much more genuine because it was all your own doing your
10395060	10398660	skill your persistence and also I believe they are referring to not a
10398660	10402180	picture of me but a picture of my cat and yes my cat is much cuter than I am
10402180	10408300	that what it is all because you just tweeted a picture your cat I put the cat
10408300	10413740	in there for size reference okay see under so it is a large someone asked
10413740	10417780	like ready to be sure me I'm like no sure me hasn't moved Loki's house all
10417780	10425340	right moving on tiger claw says there's a portal cartoon being made what yeah I
10425340	10429420	didn't hear about this there is this a real thing or is this a fan thing I mean
10429420	10432100	actually what's a fan thing I shouldn't say it like that it's not like a fan
10432100	10437220	thing can't be rushed say is this a officially endorsed thing no but it's
10437220	10443220	it's being done by professional animator it's Alex Zemke he worked on or the
10443220	10447740	movies called companionship and he is a professional animator who and credits
