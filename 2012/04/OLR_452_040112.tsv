518384	519765	It's like from the great beyond.
519785	521707	It's like, what's that crying under the ground?
522187	523848	Did someone bury a baby down there?
525550	530313	Orange Lounge Radio Live, episode number 452.
531294	536858	For those April the 1st of 2012, I can't help but feel there's something about today, like something special I was supposed to remember.
537318	538139	But, oh well, whatever.
538939	545543	So, anyhow, we're here in studio, chilling out to Dynamite Rave, which always makes me think of your freestyle routine, Loki.
546064	547164	Yes, the one I forgot.
547485	550006	I was like, ah, fuck it, I'm walking off.
550026	551907	You got up on stage, you just fucking froze.
552548	558892	No, I didn't freeze, I just like, I forgot it about halfway through, and I'm like, eh, fuck it.
559072	561333	What did the judges score you on that, when you did that?
561353	561974	I don't even remember.
562034	562694	It was like a three.
562714	563835	That was like long ago.
563875	565476	Would have been better if you hadn't used Mirror.
566396	566556	Probably.
566576	567157	Probably.
570159	570960	Good times.
571720	573462	Well, how are you doing, DarkSakura?
575243	576304	I want a burrito.
576584	576884	Do you?
577385	579346	Instead, I'm going to have tea.
579506	580967	I thought you were doing this whole fasting thing.
581007	582328	That's why I'm having tea.
582569	584550	See, Alan is being kind enough.
585191	591175	Tonight was going to be Taco Festiva here at Studio OLR, and he's been kind enough to postpone that until the show's over.
592296	593417	I appreciate it.
594558	595118	No problem.
595839	596820	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
613212	615654	No, I mean, we're not going to talk about Frogger on this show.
615674	617596	Did you miss the part about it's Bomani?
617877	622381	Yeah, I understand that, but, you know, they like to throw out those Frogger anniversaries.
622721	624823	We're celebrating the 23rd anniversary of Frogger.
624843	625804	It's like, no one fucking cares.
625844	632830	Maybe there will be a version of DDR where little frogs will show up on the little arrow pads and you can step on them to kill them.
633251	634932	That would be... I'd play that.
634952	636814	It's like that spider stomp.
637655	638556	Exactly.
640388	643110	and I have witnessed the spider stomp freestyle routine.
643170	645152	That was interesting.
645192	648054	How did the spider stomp freestyle routine go down?
648434	650936	It was Explicit that did it, I believe.
652657	653898	It was pretty awesome.
655339	655799	No, no.
656159	656740	Was it Explicit?
657185	657826	I don't remember now.
658466	659867	Was it an explicit routine?
659907	663770	Because I've seen some of those in my years of DDR festivas and so forth.
664591	665031	I don't remember.
665231	669214	It was something that came out when we went to play QZAR.
672637	674499	How does a spider stomp freestyle work?
674979	675680	I don't understand.
676740	679362	It's just like DDR, but spider stomp.
680243	682525	Step on the glowing bubbles.
684389	684609	What?
685570	685850	Nothing.
685870	689011	I was just remembering working in the arcade and having a spider stomp.
689472	691333	Did you have a spider stomp at... We did.
691653	692273	In Alabama?
692853	693714	Wherever it was you were?
693934	696515	When I worked at Cyber Station, we had a spider stomp.
697316	698716	I was really good at spider stomp.
699397	699817	Just saying.
700758	701439	DarkSakura, ladies first
725013	732539	So, uh, Friday, actually Thursday, I called my friend's new boss and said, hey, I'd like to work there.
733761	737323	Friday, I went in for, no, no, that was Wednesday because I was at school.
737784	741367	Thursday, I get a call back asking, how did you get the number?
742911	743812	and send me your resume.
744273	749739	Then I get a call back after I had my second interview for eHarmony and they're like, okay, can you come in tomorrow?
750519	751280	So I went in Friday.
751300	753483	They're like, we like you.
754524	755205	So now I have a job.
755965	756826	I start Monday.
756846	758028	Yay, you got a job.
758068	759429	Yay, Kermit, yay.
760010	762833	So eHarmony, when they're, you know, like for example...
765086	767287	Checking out new candidates for job positions.
767327	770528	Do they match them up with different levels of compatibility?
771649	774310	Ironically, they actually go through a recruiting service.
776951	780673	Maybe you're 80% compatible for this job and maybe only 60%.
780833	782633	Sorry, you're homosexual.
782673	783394	You cannot apply.
783754	788816	Not true because they have a service called Compatible Partners now because they got sued into it.
790577	793238	But yeah, so I got to send them a rejection letter.
794319	795080	The eHarmony people.
795100	796521	How do you go about writing a rejection letter?
796801	799203	Are you really supposed to be talking about what company you said no to?
799283	799904	I mean, I don't know.
801305	802486	I'm sure they don't listen to this show.
802966	803927	If they do, sorry.
804427	809632	I was like, I regret to inform you that I have chosen a more qualified position with another company.
811373	813114	You know, I said, they're paying me more.
813975	817478	It's, you know, better work, more challenging, more what I'm looking for.
817818	818399	Give me money.
818659	819680	I'm sorry, we're not a match.
819820	819880	Bye.
822170	823411	You stood up, eHarmony.
823791	824451	That's awesome.
826232	831055	I mean, honestly, eHarmony, judging everything, they just seemed like a fantastic company to work for.
831095	834677	The working from home thing would have been cool, but I have bills.
835798	840440	And on top of that, I need to get out of the house.
840500	842701	How long has the job dry spell been going on now?
842741	843622	It's been a little bit, right?
845086	872822	It's been bad for a lot of people I got laid off November 2010 Oh wow So yeah, it's been a while But here's the funny thing I will be working with my BFF Becky We worked at the same last job That's not a recipe for disaster or anything No, because we know how to behave in a professional environment We're doing two different jobs on top of that It's going to be nice Very cool Loki, how was your week?
872842	873322	How was your day?
874696	879900	Mainly this week, it was just kind of, I don't know, back to work.
880901	886925	Because last week I was off a couple days to watch Josh while Nellie was going to the doctor and stuff.
887826	890468	And then, what else did I do?
893791	894211	Slept.
894872	895232	Nothing.
895552	897193	I didn't sleep that much, actually.
897414	898514	No, it was pretty much...
900714	903317	Oh, we saw the Hunger Games last week.
904479	905800	I think I already talked about that, though.
907743	912509	Nelly went and saw the Bodyguard in theaters.
913130	913410	What? !
914105	930739	Yeah, because they had one night, it was the 20th anniversary of The Bodyguard, and so she went and saw it in theaters, and she said that the sound mix was horrible, that when they, I guess, remastered it, they remastered it in a tin can, and so it just sounded very tinny.
930799	933101	Does this mean that they're coming out with a new Blu-ray or something?
933281	936564	Yes, it came out on Tuesday, actually, and she wants that.
937024	938625	Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis
962903	983675	which is being written by Seth MacFarlane it's about a guy who wishes for his teddy bear to come alive on Christmas and then he does and so he has this walking talking teddy bear but now he's grown up and so there's this teddy bear that's with him that's just like this boozing prostitute sleeping with you know druggy teddy bear I'm like I'm not sure how I feel about
984075	984635	DarkSakura.com
1000054	1000955	I read a book, y'all.
1001856	1002877	I read a book.
1003578	1005119	I read a book from start to finish.
1005260	1005720	You can read?
1005840	1006341	I did.
1006561	1007061	I can.
1007522	1008143	And I read a book.
1008203	1010185	I read a book in like four days.
1010265	1011226	I think it only took me about four days.
1011766	1013388	I read The Hunger Games.
1013889	1014489	Okay.
1016171	1016972	I'm disappointed.
1017072	1020636	Didn't I give you a copy of Ready Player One?
1020776	1020896	No.
1022157	1024319	Well, then I'm going to give you a copy of Ready Player One.
1024379	1025040	I want to read that.
1025260	1026401	All right, I'll read Ready Player One.
1026421	1028062	I'll give you both a copy of Ready Player One.
1028342	1028663	Sweet.
1029023	1030944	No, I don't know why I read The Hunger Games.
1030985	1032726	I mean, yes, I know it's a movie and all that stuff.
1032786	1033527	Oh, my God, I heard.
1034427	1039391	But all my friends are reading it and just raving and raving about it and won't shut up about what a good book it is.
1039412	1040613	So I'm like, fine, I'll check it out.
1040693	1041173	I'll try it.
1041693	1043675	And so I read the whole thing start to finish and it wasn't bad.
1044115	1046477	So what did I do the day after I read The Hunger Games?
1047018	1047758	Went and saw the movie.
1048839	1070525	and seeing the movie with everything so fresh in my mind was it was easy for me to pick out everything that really bugged me about what they changed from the book and even Alan commented like I could tell every time they changed something from the book because I would just hear this deep sigh coming from over where you're at yeah but I think according to my wife she said that actually the movie is better than the book
1071236	1072577	Um, they're different.
1072857	1074398	I'm not going to say one is better than the other.
1074438	1075358	I think they were both good.
1075638	1076839	They were both good in their own way.
1076939	1090185	But because they moved, the biggest problem, quote unquote, with the translation is that because the book is first person and the movie's third person, there's a lot they have to do differently because you're not inside her head.
1090545	1096387	So they have to use a lot of these other scenes to kind of explain what's going on because she can't do it in her head for you.
1096808	1099209	So seeing these extra scenes was a little weird.
1100009	1100630	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1121790	1123252	Battle Royale wasn't necessarily totally original either!
1123272	1123332	Huh!
1139315	1143177	I'm just a little offended that you would read the book for the Hunger Games, but you didn't read Battle Royale.
1143317	1145558	I did try to read Battle Royale, but it was kind of boring.
1146359	1146919	It was good.
1147419	1154683	But I was telling a friend this, is that if I'm not in the exact right mood when I'm reading a book, then I'm going to squirrel, do something else.
1154703	1155884	Like my ADD is so bad.
1156164	1157284	So I'll try to read Battle Royale.
1157305	1158485	That's because you can't read.
1158945	1161086	That's because you weren't reading Ready Player One.
1162047	1162607	Maybe that.
1162747	1163148	Maybe that.
1164128	1179334	so but I liked um of course I liked Battle Royale I'm not dogging on Battle Royale it's a fine movie and hell many years ago on this show we used to talk about you know didn't we start off one show with a paper plate Battle Royale one night I seem to remember it was really funny and stupid
1179833	1183816	DarkSakura is not in the room right now and I want to wait for her to get back so we can do the news.
1183836	1184457	Um...
1207159	1227171	I don't know I've been very kind of much a homebody I didn't get a new job this week I've been at the same job for 10 years but I like my jobs it's okay so I we went to the movies yesterday then we went out to Chinese food which was good this is great radio in that yeah
1228851	1232633	Do you think maybe I should do a break song and then we'll come back and we'll talk about what's going on in the news this week?
1233694	1234575	Yeah, sure.
1234635	1235755	All right, we're going to do a quick break.
1236056	1239598	We're going to come back and we'll talk about what is in the news this week.
1239698	1241579	There's a lot of stuff, so stay tuned, guys.
1241599	1242960	We'll be right back with more of Orange Launch Radio.
1260057	1264761	In the city where the sound sign shines, that person left a shadow and disappeared.
1264781	1267883	Suddenly, goodbye, I loved you, I realized at that time.
1267903	1271026	Memories are in dreams, I wake up when I forget them.
1291276	1292597	Thank you for watching.
1292617	1293478	See you next time.
1335020	1335680	Hi, we're back.
1336220	1337661	DarkSakura's all better.
1338001	1338961	She's back joining us.
1340402	1341682	You didn't stink up the bathroom, did you?
1341982	1342302	No.
1344103	1344343	Good.
1345330	1347792	If you must know, iPad2P, thank you.
1348052	1349874	Ah, la la la la, TMI.
1350814	1352015	All right, so news.
1352336	1359281	There's lots and lots of Bomani news going on this week because Konami had a surprise Kisanera event, which, surprise, we weren't invited to.
1359841	1360382	What a shock.
1360822	1361062	Mm-hmm.
1362490	1363110	Thanks for watching!
1382641	1402877	which as you know is the name for it over in Europe but they've also used this in Japan before for artist exclusive games and they're going back to that like when was the last Dancing Stage game we had Dancing Stage featuring Dreams Come True yeah was it I couldn't remember if Dreams Come True or True Kiss Destination one of them was back in like 99 or 2000 what which for the record I found my copy of that
1403317	1404978	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1425410	1441734	of course right so it just made sense that she's gonna get her own dancing stage game now we don't know all the songs that are gonna be in it but we do know Bad Romance is in it because that was the song that they demoed in the trailer which makes sense do you think Bad Romance would be a tough DDR song do you think that'll be like a seven or an eight or a nine or what
1442672	1457888	I put it at a 7 I could see them doing some runs If I remember correctly, I believe the True Kiss, Destination, and the Dreams Come True stuff Those songs weren't that hard I think it was like 6 and 7 were the highest Because it's more of the casual
1458889	1459790	Paragaga
1480968	1482089	They're not going to do that.
1482269	1483711	I'm so on board with this idea.
1483811	1485853	Paragaga, come on.
1485913	1487175	They're not going to do something like that.
1487255	1489337	Or how about the other game, Paraparagaga.
1490586	1490946	Maybe.
1491026	1492448	Maybe if this one does very well.
1492768	1495270	Now what's weird is that they haven't talked about any home releases for this.
1495290	1497352	So this is like an arcade exclusive thing.
1498053	1499534	But that's usually how it works.
1499554	1501116	They'll have a home release later on.
1501136	1502337	True.
1502377	1506881	They'll just dump it into the engine of a Dance Dance Revolution game or something like that.
1507001	1507722	Yeah, that makes sense.
1508122	1516130	Now this is really weird because did the other Dancing Stage games have a couple songs from other artists, like a couple Konami originals in it?
1517070	1528335	I don't remember because I found this really weird there is actually a Katy Perry song in this game too California Girls is apparently going to be playable in this game it's in the press release but it's only available in basic mode
1530068	1530549	Really?
1530609	1532610	Something about Katy Perry is only basic.
1533710	1534891	It's only available in basic.
1536992	1537532	Go figure.
1537572	1542435	It'd be a very casual, relaxed song, but I could definitely see some freestyle to that.
1543055	1545977	I could definitely see Wendell busting out a California Girl.
1546137	1553661	Perhaps they're going even so far as to say, you know how they did with some of the other mixes where they'll have a preview of the following mix?
1553901	1557183	Maybe they're previewing the Katy Perry version or
1557503	1558103	I'd say seven.
1584853	1586314	I just don't care.
1586914	1587674	I mean, really?
1588175	1592937	I mean, hey, more Dancing Stage DDR mixes are a good thing, I guess, so I'll give it a 5.
1593817	1599900	I'll give it an 11, because there's nothing in the world I love more than DDR and Lady Gaga, so there you go.
1601281	1602862	What if it was RuPaul's?
1604783	1606804	Dancing Stage featuring RuPaul's Drag Race.
1606844	1608365	Dancing Stage featuring ABBA.
1609006	1609406	You're right.
1609466	1611427	That would be a 12 if it was Dancing Stage featuring ABBA.
1611447	1614429	Well, didn't you say that you would get a PS3 when an ABBA game came out?
1614509	1617071	And sure enough, SingStar ABBA came out and guess what I got?
1617351	1617571	PS3.
1617831	1621433	Did you ever pick up the ABBA You Can Dance?
1621714	1622374	Yes, I did.
1622634	1625436	That was the best thing I've ever seen in my entire life.
1625476	1627817	If we were hooked up to do it, I would play it live on air tonight.
1627837	1629038	But sadly, we're not.
1629318	1630039	Oh, darn.
1631180	1631640	What a bummer.
1631920	1633862	That was seriously the happiest moment of my life.
1634803	1634983	What?
1635003	1636064	Watching me play that?
1636184	1641648	Watching you do the ballet-style stuff for The Winner Takes It All.
1643050	1644531	That was the best thing I've ever seen.
1644851	1645151	All right.
1645231	1651497	Well, let's move on to the other big piece of news from the Konami Kisanera event that had to do with Bomani.
1651977	1655660	And this kind of was a surprise because you guys know we've been saying this on the show for years.
1655740	1655940	This...
1656701	1658202	Series was really underrated.
1658502	1660623	And a lot of people gave this series a lot of shit.
1660643	1662364	And it was actually really good if you play it.
1663645	1665747	Yeah, right.
1665807	1671330	So, the game that is announced, Rock Revolution 2 has been announced.
1671410	1671970	Oh, I'm sorry.
1672010	1673431	I thought you were talking about a good series.
1673751	1677714	Rock Revolution 2 was announced for consoles and arcade.
1678754	1680235	So, I guess it's kind of like a reboot.
1680255	1684678	Well, I mean, if it's arcades, then they're probably just renaming Guitar Freaks to Armenia.
1684698	1684778	Yeah.
1685031	1685431	Probably.
1685451	1688353	I think they're trying to Americanize it a little bit, or maybe they ran out of mixed numbers.
1688773	1690053	Could be what they did.
1690834	1691514	This is Konami.
1691534	1693215	I don't think they'll ever run out of mixed numbers.
1693415	1694536	But this is interesting.
1694576	1697777	Konami is actually thinking outside of the box and doing something a little different here.
1698418	1704440	Rock Revolution 2, the console versions, will link up to the arcades using Konami's transferring.
1705021	1707442	So you're actually going to be able to take your unlocks...
1707662	1708623	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1731752	1735456	Could I play, would this allow me to play GWAR in the arcade, yes or no?
1735716	1751872	I don't know, maybe, it would probably be something more like, you know, you could take your ranked, like say you score something, like a high score on a song and you can take that to the arcade and take it home and that way it's still linked to your, you know, Konami profile or whatever.
1753934	1754574	DarkSakura, you're awfully quiet.
1754594	1756175	Does the prospect of a Rock Revolution 2 excite you?
1782754	1783275	Not really.
1783515	1783695	Why not?
1783715	1784956	Because I didn't play the Rock Revolution 1.
1786738	1787478	I was too busy.
1787759	1789080	Maybe it's time to catch up.
1789800	1792122	I've been too busy with Parapara lately.
1793464	1801791	So anything new right now is just sort of like, but I want to wave my arms and wear pink and, you know, platform boots.
1801851	1802652	And who doesn't?
1806143	1812848	I think that if they keep up with... I like the transferring element to it.
1813849	1814829	That can make it exciting.
1816070	1819453	But I still would have to wait for judging the final...
1823617	1827100	All we have are these fluffy press releases and things to go off of.
1827120	1829642	So I don't really want to get excited until I see something.
1830742	1833825	Now, some folks in our chat room, which, by the way, I still have not plugged the chat room.
1834285	1837407	We are no longer on Calibamani.com, so don't go there.
1837707	1839749	You want to go to chat.orangelandreda.com.
1839789	1840689	That changed recently.
1840709	1841650	We're not on Calibamani.
1841670	1844212	It's chat.orangelandreda.com, so check that out.
1844352	1848175	And Tigerclaw says, will Rock Revolution 2 have Kinect support on the 360?
1848215	1848775	Maybe.
1849095	1849415	Maybe.
1850517	1851762	It's certainly possible.
1851842	1852586	Anything's possible.
1853723	1854183	I can see it.
1854464	1858846	I mean, Konami's done some Kinect-enabled games recently, so why not?
1859387	1859847	Why not?
1860227	1860527	Exactly.
1860847	1866731	Now, I was curious what Harmonix was going to do in response to this, and it looks like Harmonix is cutting them off.
1867051	1867872	Did you notice this?
1868192	1869713	Harmonix released this today.
1869753	1870433	Did you guys see this?
1870814	1871694	This is pretty amazing.
1871754	1872795	Product not yet rated.
1874736	1876577	Time for our rock band party.
1877077	1878258	Yay!
1878438	1879099	No way, guys!
1879159	1880780	I've got something brand new!
1881020	1881100	Woo!
1882207	1883662	It's Rock Band Board Game!
1896471	1897252	That's right!
1897452	1901195	Rock Band Board Game is the newest game from Harmonix Musical Systems.
1901455	1906779	Featuring all the fun and authenticity of rock band without the hassle of big bulky instruments.
1907499	1910181	See, that seems like a dig a little bit at Konami.
1910342	1912523	Like the whole, like, you don't need instruments for this.
1912683	1913364	That's a dig.
1913944	1915545	And Board Game, who would have thought?
1915586	1919328	Konami advancing technology with transferring and all this stuff.
1919609	1921310	Harmonix scaling back.
1921630	1922211	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1942489	1942989	That's very true.
1943009	1944410	You know, actually, let me explain.
1944430	1945311	Did you see the dice?
1945411	1946691	I got face screwed!
1946852	1952755	The Rock Band board game has a larger song library than any other rhythm action board game!
1956697	1957137	Yeah!
1957378	1958158	Setlist challenge!
1958498	1959879	Draw three random song cards.
1960399	1962300	Say it ain't so!
1962521	1963161	Tubular!
1963181	1965622	Say it ain't so!
1966043	1966523	Again!
1967343	1967724	Okay.
1968064	1969925	Say it ain't so!
1971774	1976219	You know, I do notice Say It Ain't So, I end up playing that an awful lot in Rock Band.
1976399	1981083	Hopefully they'll put out a patch to just, you know, it's not that I hate that song.
1981143	1983105	Maybe you should pick another song.
1983305	1984366	I think you've played this enough.
1984386	1985007	Yeah, exactly.
1985547	1987549	The Rock Band features you've come to love.
1987789	1989891	The party will never stop rocking.
1990232	1992274	Features like Character Creator.
1993499	1994200	Auto-calibration!
2015078	2019039	It was very interesting watching the different directions these two companies go in.
2020200	2023741	So Rock Revolution 2, how amazing is this news on a scale of 1 to 10?
2024061	2024381	Loki?
2026241	2027642	It all depends on how good it is.
2027662	2032043	I mean, because it could be very terrible or it could be very good.
2033103	2033463	I don't know.
2034063	2035264	I'm not ready to rate it yet.
2035884	2036184	All right.
2036244	2036624	Fair enough.
2036664	2037144	DarkSakura?
2037284	2039325	I'm just going to say a 6 for my excitement level.
2040000	2040500	I'll wait and see.
2041401	2046305	I'm going to give it a nine because I'm just excited that Rock Revolution is coming back.
2046605	2047246	I'm very excited.
2047266	2050529	And this whole thing sounds like it's going to be amazing and push technology forward.
2050889	2052590	All right, one more story we've got to cover tonight.
2052630	2056774	This did not come out of the event, but oh my God, it was like timed at the exact same time.
2057034	2057534	It's crazy.
2057554	2059015	I couldn't say anything about it either.
2059155	2059596	I know.
2059676	2060316	What is up with that?
2060336	2062018	You're supposed to be like our inside scoop to this.
2062418	2063820	I had an NDA.
2063860	2064741	I'm sorry.
2065261	2066022	Fuck your NDA.
2066062	2067824	And I wanted to go to Las Vegas again.
2067985	2068425	Alright, alright.
2068465	2069306	Here it is, you guys.
2070047	2073010	DDR Freak Extreme has been announced.
2073051	2073551	That's right.
2073631	2074292	A press release.
2074372	2080659	J-Dog, the owner of DDRFreak.com, of course, put out a press release this week that simply said, we are starting over.
2081440	2083581	and they are going to relaunch DDR Freak.
2083621	2086622	It's going to be DDRFreakExtreme.com.
2086942	2093325	There will be an upgraded Machine Locations database that will have Google Maps integration with it, which I think that's smart, right?
2093685	2094665	Everything's on Google Maps now.
2095146	2100188	And they're going to have brand new forums because the forums were starting to be a little bit of a problem, right, DarkSakura?
2100208	2101008	You were a moderate, yeah?
2101761	2108843	So they're going to do brand new forums, and what they're doing, they're actually going to let random topics have their own sub-forums.
2109203	2115405	So the Wolf Game is now going to have its own sub-forum, and Pornography Post will have its own sub-forum.
2115565	2124587	There's actually a code written into the PHPBB that's going to allow any of those external sites that like to traffic through forums.
2125268	2126228	They all just go directly there.
2127148	2127589	Oh, that's great.
2127609	2128329	It's their own forum.
2128509	2131812	You know, because when I think, where am I going to go to get porno links?
2132453	2133213	DDR free.
2133253	2137297	I mean, it's also for the Goat's Apex and the Bukkake and everything.
2137357	2137797	That's great.
2137837	2138358	Lemon Party?
2138558	2139999	Will there be like a sub-sub forum?
2141300	2142241	I'm sure there will be.
2142261	2143662	Two girls, one cup reaction videos?
2143682	2147025	But we have to have a moderator for that with a very strong stomach.
2147325	2147626	I see.
2147666	2150188	Well, you know, how did you audition people for that?
2150628	2151549	Who ended up getting that?
2152389	2153550	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2170549	2171270	All right, awesome.
2171830	2177654	But the other thing that is actually going to be that I finally got the okay to talk about.
2177735	2179015	Wait, is this like an exclusive?
2179636	2180937	It could be an exclusive.
2181197	2185821	Is DDR Freak Radio going to get pissed off because that might be a little weird because, you know, there's the two radio stations.
2185861	2191985	Well, there was a little talk about they wanted to acquire us.
2192546	2192926	What?
2194147	2196048	So, like, we're going to be the official radio station?
2196088	2197670	What's going to happen to DDR Freak Radio?
2198070	2199211	Well, it's gone.
2199231	2199311	Gone.
2200609	2201930	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2225865	2227006	Hell yeah, that'd be awesome.
2228087	2229628	Good idea to get the community back together.
2229968	2230449	Exactly.
2230709	2232850	There's the other thing, too, that is kind of hush-hush.
2233331	2234472	Okay, ooh, I love exclusives.
2234492	2235072	DDR Flash.
2235673	2236053	What's this?
2236113	2237434	That works with a USB dance pad.
2240313	2241794	So like integrated into the site?
2241994	2242955	Yeah.
2242995	2244436	Can you do like your own music and stuff?
2245037	2245737	That I don't know yet.
2245757	2246758	They're still working on licensing.
2246978	2247258	I see.
2247418	2249840	You can actually browse the forums using the dance pad.
2250701	2251421	Oh, that's cool.
2251461	2252162	I like that idea.
2252562	2253202	I like that idea.
2253783	2256905	Especially if you're looking at the porn forums.
2257446	2263950	But they've actually done a Kinect hack as well so that you can navigate the site with your Kinect controller.
2263970	2266292	There was the 1.5 release of Kinect on PC.
2266452	2267633	And have full integration.
2269867	2275750	So, DDR Freak Extreme, let's go around and rate the importance of that news on a scale of 1 to 10.
2276190	2276830	DarkSakura?
2277050	2277810	Totally a 10.
2277890	2280371	DDR Freak was the best time I ever had.
2280431	2282072	Biased, biased, biased.
2282992	2283292	Loki?
2284733	2283292	8.
2285273	2286954	We always need more places for porn links.
2287374	2288194	That's true, that's true.
2288714	2290875	I would normally give it an 8, but the porn forum?
2291535	2290875	9.
2292035	2293316	It's very important, so 9.
2293676	2293776	But...
2294815	2299643	Well, and you know the other thing, too, is that for people who are offended, they just don't have to click on it.
2299684	2300184	That's right.
2300244	2300846	Don't click it.
2301046	2301947	It's the best thing ever.
2303270	2305534	And they, oh, oh, I have to tell you about the other form that got added.
2306275	2306455	What?
2306575	2307216	A lolcat form.
2308844	2309745	All little cats.
2310045	2312327	How nice that they've evolved with the rest of the internet.
2312487	2312928	I know.
2313128	2313849	Oh, it's great.
2313969	2314269	Okay.
2314569	2315250	Oh, I'm so happy.
2315510	2319614	I have to shut my mouth before I let out the whole grid thing.
2319694	2322516	Will the users that were banned last time still be banned?
2323057	2324218	We're going to make them their own forum.
2325399	2325559	Oh.
2325899	2327721	Like the troll grounds or something.
2327741	2328962	We're going to call it Hall of the Band.
2329663	2329763	Oh.
2330717	2331138	I like that.
2331158	2332619	It's a catchy name.
2333160	2334801	All right, well, don't go anywhere, guys.
2334821	2336103	We have plenty more show to come.
2336143	2341588	We have the cage match that's coming up in just a little bit, FUs of the Week, and we might just have to play match game.
2342289	2343110	Yay!
2343250	2346634	All right, so we'll be back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio after a quick break.
2449787	2450608	April Fools
2469703	2471724	All the stories we talked about, sadly, were fake.
2472044	2474645	I mean, really, the Konami Kissing Era event, please.
2475485	2476505	So we made all that shit up.
2476745	2479446	And DDR Freak is... People outside California don't know what those are.
2479726	2483507	Some folks in chat generally got excited that DDR Freak was coming back.
2484448	2485068	Sorry.
2485948	2486628	Don't be mad.
2486688	2487269	Don't sue us.
2487489	2491810	I'm thoroughly glad I don't have to moderate DDR Freak anymore.
2492850	2494611	Because, you know what?
2494711	2497392	I actually have to tell you about a realization that I had.
2498092	2498352	What's that?
2498948	2504273	I went back and read on one site the graffiti that they found on the walls in Pompeii.
2505674	2514563	And it made me think of the same shit I would see on DDR Freak, which proves to me that in the last however many thousand years, humanity has not grown at all.
2516084	2517946	There were trolls even back in the olden days.
2518006	2522050	No, there was one post that said, so and so, like...
2524148	2525509	Did some girl in the ass here.
2527530	2529531	And ran away with her brother.
2529731	2530391	How naughty.
2531372	2533773	All right, so anyway, yeah, everything we just did was bull.
2533793	2539936	But we thought it would be fun for our... Especially because it's the 10th year of OLR and April Fool's happens to be on a Sunday.
2540036	2545399	And look, we're never going to top the giggling lesbian gaming show that we did in 2006, which will always be the best prank we ever did.
2546480	2548541	We thought we'd do that for our little April Fool's gag.
2548581	2549201	So there you go.
2550942	2557588	Anyhow, let's get back into the real show because there's been a lot of stuff going on in the gaming world this week that we want to touch on.
2558128	2559529	Big, big news.
2560590	2564233	Rumor news that I think Loki said might take the whole damn show tonight.
2564293	2566775	So we're going to talk about that a little bit as well.
2567676	2570318	First, though, the real version of what we do at the top of the show.
2570758	2571859	How was your gaming week?
2572059	2573981	Talking about the video games we've played this week.
2574521	2575542	DarkSakura, you want to start us off?
2575562	2576763	What video games have you been playing this week?
2576803	2582764	I looked at that copy of Mass Effect and then Dan and I talked about it and then I got too busy to play because I was busy getting a job.
2583005	2583625	Shame on you.
2583645	2584605	I was busy getting a job.
2584945	2585445	Fine.
2585605	2588786	I guess a job will be an acceptable excuse maybe.
2588866	2590206	I did play well.
2590846	2591407	Of course you did.
2591647	2592287	Of course I did.
2592627	2594267	Because you have an addiction.
2594467	2594807	Dealer.
2596008	2596948	Loki, how was your gaming week?
2597909	2598970	My gaming week was alright.
2599030	2600071	I didn't play a whole lot.
2600131	2601112	I played Call of Duty.
2602033	2604235	I know.
2605856	2610099	And then I also played... What was it?
2610179	2615023	The saxophone game that I posted.
2615283	2619367	It's... God, I can't remember now.
2620448	2620548	Um...
2622543	2625745	Anyways, so a little internet game.
2625785	2628126	It was kind of fun.
2629827	2631008	Was it Sax Maniacs?
2631388	2632529	It was Epic Sax Game.
2633630	2634010	All right.
2634070	2636892	Based off of the Epic Sax guy from...
2638137	2639518	Oh, yeah.
2639838	2650724	It's hilarious because it's actually a little music rhythm game and you have to learn how to play that little bit of music there and then you keep playing it over and over and over again.
2650744	2652285	I don't know, it's fun.
2652345	2657808	There's a lot of songs out there that have epic sax solos in them, so hot sax all night long.
2658768	2661570	Well, this is specifically the epic sax guy.
2661850	2662130	All right.
2662670	2663231	Specifically.
2663651	2665432	Have you ever seen the original that that came from?
2666277	2667198	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2689316	2689856	Eurovision.
2690477	2693379	It was part of this Eurovision thing.
2694559	2697181	Was that that big competition they do that's like American Idol or whatever?
2697241	2697761	Yeah, sort of.
2698362	2700663	Oh, I know what you're talking about.
2700843	2701884	Never mind, I know what you're talking about.
2702024	2707287	The guy wearing the blue pants and the red gloves who kind of looks like Duke Nukem.
2707807	2710429	Hip thrusting to his Epic Sax solo.
2710689	2712070	It's an awesome song.
2713271	2715172	Alright, so that it for your gaming week?
2715658	2716939	That is all I played this week.
2741108	2742949	So I've been playing that a little, little bit.
2743469	2746911	Otherwise on the consoles, I'm still plucking away at Mass Effect 2.
2747351	2749892	I think I'm about halfway through the game from what Shane tells me.
2750933	2754054	I've picked up some of my partners and now I've got a few more.
2754174	2757696	I did some events on a planet and it unlocked some more dossiers.
2757736	2759697	For those of you that have played the game, you can kind of tell where I'm at.
2760598	2778316	still loving the Mass Effect series the battle system has gotten a little better for me because you might remember last week on the show I was bitching about the battles in Mass Effect 2 compared to 1 but I'm liking it a little more now that I have more abilities I really like that you can kind of take an ability from one of your loyal friends
2778736	2779477	Thanks for watching!
2795985	2799229	I've been using that, but Mass Effect 2 is still awesome.
2800210	2801892	That's really about it.
2802052	2804535	I play, oh, no, one other game I've got to talk about.
2804555	2805136	This is important.
2805616	2809100	I haven't played this a lot, but I played it a little bit, so I'll talk about it a little bit.
2810122	2810943	Kid Icarus Uprising.
2811263	2812144	I played some of that, actually.
2812244	2812705	I got on the 3DS.
2812765	2813305	On my friends.
2813365	2813606	Yeah?
2814046	2814447	What'd you think?
2814987	2815347	It's cool.
2815947	2816708	The 3D actually works.
2817008	2818188	Yeah, the 3D is great.
2818248	2819549	It's a gorgeous game.
2820089	2824451	I was really into the way that it's set up like Super Smash Bros.
2824511	2824831	too.
2824851	2827272	The menus and everything look just like Super Smash Bros.
2827412	2829312	I like the customizing your weapons thing.
2829632	2834034	Yeah, I mean, there's so many little... I mean, you can tell it's designed... I mean, hello, I'm not stupid.
2834054	2835775	I know it's the same people that did Smash Bros.
2835815	2836215	that did this.
2836755	2839416	But it has all those same mini-games.
2839716	2868560	Like for Smash Brothers Like, you know, the machine where you put in coins And you can get like an egg You know, that has something special in it The grid of unlocks I mean, there's tons and tons and tons of stuff in the game And I love the air stages in the game It is so awesome It makes me think of Space Harrier Yes, it's beautiful to look at too And I love it when it's on rails and all this Then it gets to the ground stages And it's
2869020	2897947	it's not that I dislike the ground stages but that's where and I think you know any of you that have been reading reviews about the game the controls are not good for the ground stages because you I mean just the way you have to hold the controller you have to move with the little circle pad you shoot with the L button and then you flick on the bottom pad left and right real quick to spin your character left and right and you use it to move your targeter
2899033	2901434	So it's kind of a lot going on with that touchscreen.
2901454	2903015	You have to hold it very awkward.
2903396	2908599	And yes, Kid Icarus comes with that stand, but that kind of defeats the purpose of having a portable gaming system.
2908619	2910019	We have to kind of like use that stand.
2910600	2913882	So the controls disappoint me a little bit.
2914795	2929686	But otherwise, it's really a shame that something like that really screws the game in the way that it does because I love the storytelling and the videos and tutorial videos and all that in it because they break the fourth wall constantly.
2930546	2957917	and all these in jokes like the game was made for people that remember the old Kid Icarus and constantly they're like you know oh it's been 25 years since we last saw Medusa and then it'll show like it says here's a picture of Medusa and it changes to that hideous looking thing from the eight big Kid Icarus and somebody writes Medusa in an arrow and it points at it like all these really dumb things and you know kind of some of those adult level jokes that kids wouldn't get but adults do and a lot of that is really funny.
2959242	2963886	Going to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Game Girl says, is it worth it?
2963946	2965828	Was thinking of getting Kid Icarus Uprising.
2966448	2972233	It really depends on how tied you are to this series and all that.
2972653	2975395	You know, I paid $30 for it, which I think is a fair price.
2976196	2979178	I think Best Buy had a discount, so Amazon price matched it.
2979559	2980559	So I got it for that price.
2981700	2984723	$40 might be a little steep, depending on, you know...
2985143	3008803	I wish there was a mode and maybe there will be one at the end where you could just play the sky stages because the sky stages are where this game is the best because you don't have to worry about turning pit and you just use the thing to move them and you use the touchpad to move the targeting and the game is fantastic and it's at its best in those stages and the 3D looks great but otherwise the ground stages kind of take away from the rest of the game for me
3009824	3024859	but I still think it's a solid 3DS game I think it's definitely worth hopefully they'll put out a demo or something so you can kind of evaluate if it's for you I want it to do well because I like the idea of the Kid Icarus series coming back but I'm not going to sit here and say the game is flawless when it's not
3025259	3032048	It's bad they couldn't patch it to use the Circle Pad Pro as, you know... Well, you actually can if you're a lefty.
3032748	3037054	Because the lefty controls are using the Circle Pad Pro and then using your left hand for the stylus.
3037094	3041660	I understand that, but I meant, like, you know, the second analog instead of the touchpad.
3042921	3049564	Well, I want to say there was customizable controls in there too, so maybe there's a way you can kind of fix it and maybe kind of do that.
3049905	3050705	But I can't see.
3050725	3053987	The problem is if you did that, Loki, then you'd have nothing to use to target.
3054287	3058489	You'd have to move and then pick up your stylus and target, and it would be kind of disjointed.
3058569	3060190	You'd use the right analog to target.
3063260	3064680	Yeah, but then how would you turn your screen?
3064900	3066421	You still have to use your stylus to turn the screen.
3066761	3067482	That's stupid.
3067702	3070964	First person shooters don't have that problem.
3071244	3074205	Why does this have to be an issue with this game?
3074245	3075866	Yeah, so it's a little rough there.
3077587	3082011	Uh, Porkchop in chat says, I've never played Kid Icarus ever, but Uprising looks awesome.
3082532	3092560	Let me talk about this real quick, because as a pre-order bonus, I got the Kid Icarus 3D Classics, which is the 3D version of the regular game, and it's actually really good.
3093101	3102469	Like, even though it's just the regular Kid Icarus, they put these backgrounds in every level, where the 3D is not just the back, like, the backgrounds themselves are kind of 3D, and
3103590	3123572	and I think the game is based off the disc system version and not the cartridge because there's load and save files which only existed in the disc version and I want to say the sound effects were slightly different which I remember the disc system had a different sound chip than the NES did so some of the games had slightly different sound effects so that was kind of cool
3124198	3127520	You should hear the music in the disc version of Castlevania 3.
3127920	3133623	Yeah, I always hear that Castlevania 3's got a neat little... But yeah, Kid Icarus actually had a really good music on the disc one.
3134503	3135043	And the sound.
3136124	3139066	Shane in our chatroom says, Kid Icarus used to be worse for the 3DS.
3139266	3144128	At E3, the ground stages were timed and you had to get through checkpoints so they at least fixed that.
3144208	3144788	Oh, thank God.
3144848	3146249	That would have been really bad.
3146609	3148970	I'm glad they changed that because that sounds terrible.
3150832	3153798	But anyway, the 3D Classic is actually really good.
3153918	3157624	And I wish every game got this kind.
3157725	3160349	I wish they would do this for every virtual console game.
3160630	3162593	Because it's not that much that they did.
3163615	3168039	You know, they added backgrounds and the 3D is done tastefully.
3168219	3169440	I think that's the best way I can put it.
3169820	3173883	It's not like you've got one sprite layer here and then your background layer.
3174304	3175064	It's more than that.
3175424	3180088	There's multi-level of 3D and I think the effects are really good.
3180428	3180929	And it kind of...
3181789	3182630	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3210387	3218270	So I'm really looking forward to seeing what else... Oh God, what's the name of the developer that did the 3DS versions called?
3219750	3223471	It's like... It's not Akira, but... Akira or something like that?
3223591	3224152	Did all the...
3225800	3226441	Thank you for watching!
3249075	3265246	AlphaCanadagram in our chatroom with a tip says, just an FYI, to people that have any 3D classic games on 3DS and didn't notice, you can go into options and increase the 3D density setting even more if it's not strong enough on max if setting is untouched.
3265266	3265927	Yes, that's true.
3266407	3272091	Not just the 3D density on the slider, but there's a 3D density within the game that you can adjust, which I think is a good idea.
3272751	3272851	So...
3273832	3275194	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3292296	3303824	Since we didn't get to say it at the top of the show because of our little joke tonight, a big thank you as always to All Games Radio where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show, although not tonight.
3303905	3305165	Bobby's on a little break.
3305226	3306767	He'll be back on the 15th.
3308148	3309228	Let's get into some gaming news.
3309369	3309549	Loki.
3310731	3320062	Alright, so there's a big ol' fun rumor regarding the next PlayStation system.
3320483	3326370	Apparently, there's sources that contacted Kotaku, or Kotaku contacted...
3326950	3341056	Anyways, they figured out that the working title or possible name for the system is Orbis and that it's being planned for release sometime next holiday, so 2013 holiday.
3341176	3342796	Isn't Orbis a travel website?
3343057	3343937	No, that's Orbit.
3345297	3349819	Isn't Orbis a drink that has these little gummy things in it that's the most disgusting?
3350539	3351460	That was Orbit's?
3352520	3354441	Oh my god, it's like you were drinking herpes.
3354641	3366463	Now, the name for the actual console is legit because you can pull up the dev website for PlayStation and typing in Orbis or slash Orbis or whatever pulls up the actual dev site.
3366523	3369004	It's just you don't get a 404 from it.
3369284	3372525	So they have it built in place, but they just don't have anything there yet.
3372845	3373745	Kind of like with the Vita.
3374645	3375746	And that's on Sony's site.
3375766	3377188	Yes, orbis.scdev.net, their dev site.
3377208	3377688	Oh, man.
3377729	3379370	The name is real.
3379430	3380972	It's a working name or it's a...
3391443	3391703	Okay.
3391983	3393204	Yeah.
3394384	3396305	So that's real, at least.
3396925	3398265	Now, some of the specs, though.
3398625	3406468	They're saying right now that they're planning on using an AMD x64 CPU, also an AMD Southern Islands GPU.
3407408	3414351	And what they're saying right now is that it's supposed to be able to push a 4K HD, which is...
3415578	3421905	Way more than most TVs can use, although newer TVs do support it.
3422005	3423826	It's a 4096x2160.
3423987	3427871	It's a resolution far exceeding most HDTVs.
3429292	3436099	And then also they're saying it's capable of playing 3D games in 1080p, whereas the PS3 can only do that at 720p.
3439222	3450231	Also, I just want to say so far, I can believe it that they're pushing the technical limits because if you think about it, when PlayStation 3 came out, not everybody had adopted Blu-ray yet or even HD TVs.
3451292	3452793	And that was the technology they went with.
3452974	3454515	So I could kind of see that.
3454815	3455755	Here's the problem, though.
3456496	3460657	I'll cover what my issues are with the news in a sec.
3461657	3467519	Also, they're saying right now that select developers have dev kits already, which makes sense.
3467559	3468179	I mean, come on.
3468219	3470940	If it's a year out, obviously they're going to be working on games already.
3471921	3478207	No backwards compatibility whatsoever with any PS3 games, also PS2 games.
3478988	3487857	It would be assumed that stuff would be coming via emulators on the PlayStation Network since they have that right now with PS2 and PlayStation 1 games.
3487938	3490160	But why would the dev kits be backwards compatible anyway?
3490861	3493023	No, they're talking about the final product, not the dev kits.
3493450	3503696	Right, but how would the... I mean, if this is being leaked from a dev, which is what I'm assuming because the dev website's out there and everything, if this is being leaked from a developer, then why would their kits have the backwards compatibility?
3503776	3508939	They wouldn't have that, but the thing is they're telling them what the final specs are, what their specs are estimating.
3509180	3522167	And it makes sense that they would cut out backwards compatibility because, one, you can still push PlayStation 3s, and two, they want to sell those games digitally because they can make money off that, and they also don't have to put... Putting the PlayStation 2 chips in there...
3523328	3523628	and so on.
3545925	3546745	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3575593	3591360	However, much like PC games, it's going to be tied to your system, so you're going to need to have a PlayStation Network account and be online to even get the game started.
3592360	3619581	um and then on top of that they're saying that if you decide to trade in your disc or you know loan to a friend or sell it or whatever um that the next person that gets it is going to have basically kind of a limited version of the game uh either going to be like a demo form or some sort of you know hindered version kind of think of like uh I guess the online passes or something like that but who knows to what extent and they're going to pay a fee to unlock or register the full game
3621252	3623753	So there's that.
3625313	3627093	So I guess we can talk about that first.
3627394	3628354	Can we talk about that?
3628954	3629714	Let's talk about that.
3630054	3634055	Okay, so there's a few problems I have with the specs.
3634795	3638856	First off, let's talk about the 4K resolution.
3639136	3645558	That sounds good and all until you actually look up what 4K resolutions over HDMI are actually capable of.
3646559	3647399	24 frames a second.
3647860	3648260	That's it.
3648901	3653565	So if you're looking for like 60 FPS games, you're not going to get that on this.
3654006	3660572	Also, when you think about that, that's only compatible with HDMI, I think 1.4, which most TVs do not have.
3661052	3666317	So, I mean, I would assume that there's going to be some backwards compatibility with like 1080p and stuff like that.
3666377	3669160	But let's just assume that maybe there's not.
3669300	3669560	Okay.
3669600	3670922	And say they're going to be assholes about it.
3671502	3677067	Then you're going to need to buy a new TV, new sound system, new cables, just to get this fucking thing to work.
3679833	3684134	And then on top of that, like I said, 24 frames a second is not very... I mean, that's video.
3684554	3687035	Video, that's fine, like watching the movie and stuff.
3687055	3690976	But playing a game, I think you'd want higher FPS for that.
3692276	3693737	At least I would think so.
3695257	3697518	And then on top of that, I mean, let's see.
3698298	3700359	They're talking about digital downloads for games.
3700479	3705380	Now, that works okay for Vita games that are a couple gigs long.
3705980	3730272	but we're talking fucking PlayStation 4 games I mean which are going to be pushing these 4k graphics with textures that are fucking huge you're talking like I mean PlayStation 3 games right now are upwards to I'd say I mean it's possible that they're up to 50 gigabytes on a dual layer blu-ray disc 50 gigabytes most of them don't take up 50 gigs it's most of them are about like you know
3731133	3732635	10 to 20 something gigs.
3732896	3737744	But still, that's a fucking long time to download the game off of the internet.
3737884	3741369	Plus we're talking, you know, all these companies talking about bandwidth caps and stuff like that.
3741389	3742651	You're going to eat up your bandwidth.
3743914	3744594	in no time.
3744894	3753038	And they want you completely connected to the internet for some sort of back-ass words anti-piracy bullshit.
3753578	3761882	So on top of that, we don't even need to cover why that's a bad idea because look at with the whole Ubisoft always on DRM bullshit.
3762523	3769766	If their network goes down, PlayStation Network goes down for a day or so, bye-bye, can't play your game system for that whole day.
3770006	3770507	and DarkSakura.
3786716	3788658	I do not see them.
3789078	3791861	First off, GameStop is not going to let them do this.
3792501	3799207	I mean, because you think that... Didn't that one analyst who we always kind of tease on this show?
3799227	3799967	Yes, Michael Patrick.
3799987	3800768	But he made a good point.
3800868	3803971	He said GameStop is not going to sell these consoles.
3804091	3805752	Yeah, if basically, if they're...
3807173	3810794	We'll get into why they wouldn't carry these consoles.
3810854	3819136	Basically, if you're offering a system that has no used games whatsoever, it's impossible to sell a demo disc.
3819476	3826298	Let's just say, worst case scenario, you can't play anything other than a small demo on this console.
3827658	3832981	First of all, I think that's going to be a huge, huge incentive for hackers to try to fix that.
3833041	3834801	Because they're going to be like, oh, wait a second.
3835382	3836042	It's your fucking disk.
3836062	3836782	You can do whatever you want.
3837123	3839304	Plus, tying it to one account is also kind of lame.
3841044	3845486	But at the same time, it's just like, why?
3845546	3849628	If they're not going to have any used game sales or whatever, then they're not going to carry it in their store.
3849988	3853270	Much like they did carry a little bit of the PSP Go stuff.
3853826	3855727	because some people might have wanted it.
3855767	3859809	But that offered really no sales for them other than PlayStation Network cards because it was all digital.
3860369	3862010	So I just don't see them doing that.
3862070	3863791	But let's talk a little bit real quick.
3864051	3867793	Are you trying to say that GameStop had a hand in why the PSP Go failed?
3868253	3869674	No, it was stupid.
3869854	3870875	The PSP Go was dumb.
3871615	3875757	It was a system that was digital only that was priced higher than the current model out already.
3876097	3876798	Why would you buy it?
3877483	3882968	Let me read some quick comments in our chatroom at chat.orangelandradio.com GamerGirl says, I have a feeling the PS4 is going to tank.
3883629	3892237	Technus says, I doubt the game will run at 4K, maybe for full motion videos, but the games will probably run at 1080p at 60 frames per second.
3892257	3896221	Remember, a lot of these specs could be really overblown.
3896241	3902287	Remember back when they were talking about the specs of PS3, how they were saying, oh, 1080p and 120 frames per second for all games.
3902907	3904047	Yeah.
3904567	3906988	Oh, 1080p for all games and 120 frames per second.
3907268	3909088	We're just going to go crazy with that stuff.
3909208	3910268	And that never fucking happened.
3910328	3911389	I mean, whatever.
3912349	3916310	And it's very possible that this stuff could be patched in later on.
3916590	3921511	Because remember, the original, well, the Xbox 360 didn't always used to have 1080p.
3921651	3922591	It was 1080i.
3922991	3924771	And then it got patched in later on.
3925271	3926732	So they could add it later on.
3927872	3928472	So that's possible.
3928812	3938754	On this used game thing, is it possible that we're misinterpreting a system similar to what the Vita has to prevent trophy exploitation?
3939975	3940235	No.
3940255	3943676	Is it possible that it's tied to an account but you can easily remove it?
3945476	3946536	I don't think it's like that.
3946596	3949257	I think it's just because... Well...
3950205	3950525	I don't know.
3950665	3951666	I'm just going off what they said.
3951726	3952686	It's all speculation.
3953466	3954467	They said it's just limited.
3955147	3961330	Maybe it is where you can remove it off of your system when you're done with it and then it becomes free to use for somebody else.
3961490	3964131	I would hope that that would be kind of like what it is.
3964431	3978397	I have to express big reservations about this and the next Xbox, whatever it is, if the rumors are true about that as well, that Microsoft and Sony have joined together for some sort of dark pact where both these systems do not play used games.
3978417	3978597	Well,
3979157	3980418	Let me cover real quick.
3980478	3985239	Okay, so first off, and I gotta, this is Dennis Dyack.
3985779	3993602	Now, not a lot of you may be familiar with Dennis Dyack, but he's the head of development studios at Silicon Knights.
3993742	3996243	You know, Silicon Knights, the company that put out 2Human?
3998089	4000210	Thanks for watching!
4018121	4021664	He's talking about a world without used games, new consoles.
4021684	4028189	Because there are no used games, you could actually sell a game for a long time and get reoccurring revenue for quite a while.
4028570	4030091	Reoccurring revenue is very key.
4030251	4031612	Now there is no tail.
4032393	4045064	Literally, you will get most of your sales within the three months of launch, which have created this really healthy... Literally, you'll get most of your sales within three months of launch, which has created this really unhealthy extreme...
4045905	4051530	Where you have to sell it really fast and then you have to do anything else to get money.
4052331	4057596	And then it also says, I would argue, and I've said this before, that used games are cannibalizing the industry.
4057997	4067046	If developers and publishers don't see revenue from that, it's no matter of, hey, we're trying to increase the price of games to consumers and we want more.
4067626	4069648	We're just trying to survive in an industry.
4069748	4073090	If used games continue the way they are, it's going to cannibalize.
4074251	4076072	There's not going to be an industry.
4076933	4081976	People won't make these kind of games, basically saying the really high price games.
4082256	4088981	So I think it's inflated the prices of games, and I think the prices will have to come down if there's a longer tail, but there isn't.
4089361	4092243	Okay, so first off, this guy's so full of bullshit.
4092263	4095344	I mean, really, he has nothing to go off because his games suck.
4095664	4097025	It wasn't because of used games.
4097085	4098926	It was because your games sucked that it didn't sell.
4099547	4103469	But besides that, he doesn't understand how the fucking industry works.
4103549	4108151	And sad considering a guy that is in the industry doesn't understand how it works.
4109372	4115815	If you get rid of used games, you're going to get rid of the game specialty market, which is basically your game stops any game-specific store.
4115936	4118477	Retailers that deal in multiple things like...
4118797	4123483	You know, like a Best Buy or something like that, an apartment store that carries everything.
4124424	4126366	They're not necessarily going to be affected by that.
4126646	4129910	Well, first off, they don't really deal and use to begin with, but...
4131229	4131689	Thanks for watching!
4151136	4158880	and really they can't make, you can't run a business with a 20% margin because you also have to pay your employees, your rent and utilities and all that stuff.
4159680	4162062	And there's a lot of factors that go into it.
4162482	4166284	So they make up their money by used games, trade-ins and sales.
4166644	4177069	Well, the trade-ins obviously are also gonna drive new game sales because you're getting people that take their 2012 copy of Tiger Woods and they trade in for their 2013 copy of Tiger Woods.
4177849	4205746	and you turn around and you sell the Tiger Woods or whatever game it is at an increased margin basically you're buying it for $20 and you're selling it for $40 and so instead of a 20% margin you have like a 100% margin now it's a lot healthier for these companies and now yes I understand that GameStop makes a lot of money in use but you know what that's how they run their business and that's how any game store is going to run their business they can't make they can't survive on just new games
4207387	4216998	I think, honestly, if the Dark Pact is true and these companies are going to move towards used games, I think one of two things is happening.
4217198	4219841	A, they're handing Nintendo the crown.
4220282	4220622	Watch.
4221063	4221203	Watch.
4221223	4221523	Watch.
4221683	4226026	When those soccer moms go to the store in 2013, what system are they going to pick up?
4226406	4229528	The system that they don't really have the TVs to run anyway?
4229849	4232010	And the systems where they won't be able to get used games?
4232390	4235832	Or that the retailer might tell them you can't play used games on this?
4235892	4237573	You can't rent games to this system?
4237874	4238734	Or are they going to get a Wii U?
4239234	4241156	They're going to get a Wii U. Wake up call.
4241936	4246877	That's the same reason the Nintendo Wii succeeded the first time.
4246997	4249538	Let me finish.
4250118	4255439	Because if the Wii U somehow did this too, we don't know.
4256259	4258039	Nintendo could be a part of this dark pact.
4258079	4267321	We don't know the final specs of the Wii U. Let's hypothesize, and yes, this is being a little tinfoil hattie, but let's hypothesize that all three game companies are taking this stand against used games.
4268181	4271623	I call video game market crash of 83 all over again.
4271923	4273284	It will be that serious.
4273844	4275865	The video game market will crash.
4277546	4278586	Absolutely will crash.
4278806	4281868	And they've been wondering how long is it going to take for it to crash again.
4282268	4284309	This type of greed is going to cause it.
4284709	4285349	Absolutely.
4285890	4287670	I think actually, I don't think it's going to crash.
4288391	4289831	Why would I buy this system, Loki?
4290172	4290532	Why?
4290752	4292213	But that's the thing though.
4292253	4294954	Here's what I think is going to happen is it's not necessarily going to crash.
4294974	4296975	It's just they won't buy those new systems.
4297475	4298856	No one's going to buy the new systems.
4299676	4300716	And then what's going to happen?
4300896	4307339	Well, there's still plenty of people out there with the Xbox 360s and the PlayStation 3s and stuff like that.
4307359	4314382	But that's still a crash because Nintendo and Sony and Microsoft would lose so much money from putting those consoles on the shelves that no one buys.
4314402	4316443	Well, I hope that's a big wake-up call then if that's the case.
4317423	4322165	I mean, first... Sorry, it's really just not only the used games too.
4322345	4323126	I mean, the fact that...
4324566	4326428	What do these consoles really have to offer?
4326468	4330211	I mean, yeah, okay, it's the technical edge, but a lot of us don't even have that technology yet.
4330831	4334534	I myself did not buy a PlayStation 3 until they were already out for like two years.
4335275	4337456	I just... I really worry.
4337757	4342140	I mean, granted, I have to take this all with a big-ass grain of salt because this is all rumors.
4342360	4342721	All of it.
4342881	4345022	All of it's rumors until it's on the show floor at E3.
4345443	4345683	Right?
4346424	4350267	So maybe we're just getting a little bit carried away with the hysterics.
4350347	4351287	But I hope to hell...
4352048	4352748	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4368197	4373664	for a new game, and $20 for all this download content, and then block out used game sales.
4374104	4380953	There's a moment, especially in this economy, which isn't going to be fully recovered by next year, where the consumers are going to say, enough.
4381553	4383616	You have taken our money.
4383916	4385699	We're not going to give it to you anymore.
4386119	4386900	We're fine with
4387140	4391683	And on top of it, they're not even really claiming that you own the disc.
4391763	4394505	It's your licensing content from them anyways.
4395366	4401189	There is no industry out there that doesn't have used car sales.
4401810	4404892	Do we see car sales suffering because of used car sales?
4405332	4405612	No!
4405953	4407173	It's never fucking happening.
4407474	4412117	So why do you fucking think that you need money, Mr. Developer of Too Human...
4412877	4414118	for used game sales.
4414819	4417221	You don't deserve any of my money then.
4417342	4417962	That's the case?
4418042	4423227	I mean, here's how it's going to work, Mr. Dynak or whatever, or Dyak.
4423728	4425309	I don't even fucking pronounce your last name.
4425430	4426471	Whatever, Dennis Dyak.
4426811	4427892	Here's how it's going to fucking work.
4427912	4429814	Okay, let's cut out used game sales.
4431699	4432580	Thanks for watching!
4446761	4467483	and no one's buying it new and there's no used game market anymore so you know no one's buying it and then turning it over and saying oh fuck it I'm not gonna you know play this so what's gonna happen your game your brand new game is gonna have to drop in price in order to push some sales and it's gonna keep dropping in price until it gets gets down to the used game price that would have been then people are gonna buy new
4468812	4471034	So, I mean, there's no used games.
4471454	4475618	People just wait till the fucking new games to get to the price of what the used games used to be before.
4475758	4476278	And guess what?
4476298	4478300	They get all the full benefit of it.
4478320	4481683	You can't justify a $60 game if there's no resale value.
4481743	4483945	You're literally taking all of the value out of the game.
4484405	4488128	And here's another fun fact here, Dennis Dyack.
4488769	4493533	If your game system or the game system that you're putting your content on doesn't support used games...
4494955	4495655	Thanks for watching!
4519522	4521024	Yeah, we're just not going to carry it.
4521064	4522305	And they probably will listen.
4522425	4525468	I mean, why would they just stop listening to them all of a sudden?
4525508	4526829	I mean, come on.
4528291	4532915	I know we want to wrap up this topic to move on to other things, but I want to check in with Jamie because we haven't heard from her in a little bit.
4532976	4536419	And as a collector, how do you feel about no used game markets?
4537441	4539823	I think that's freaking ridiculous.
4540663	4544986	I was just saying earlier in chat that I bought a PlayStation game two weeks ago.
4545646	4547408	A PlayStation game.
4548308	4550670	I still have PlayStations.
4551510	4562777	I'm just saying that there's people out there that will still keep holding on to the older systems, like say they may have an Xbox and not a 360, because all they buy is used games.
4563898	4584683	and you know that's that's their prerogative they can do that I think that if you take out the ability to sell the game back get a little money back in their pocket so they can go out and afford to buy a new game that they're basically going to be cutting out let's just say at least a good 25% of their market
4587105	4590949	Just in the people that basically resell games so that they can buy a new game.
4591169	4591390	Right.
4592331	4596736	I mean, when you think about it, that disc will be worth nothing by the time you take it out of the shrink wrap.
4596816	4597737	It is now worth nothing.
4597777	4605125	They're literally saying, though, that you can pop it in your system, mark it as, oh, I own this, and then you can literally throw the disc away.
4606243	4610869	But who has the bandwidth from Comcast or whatever your provider is to support that?
4611449	4612991	You have a 250 gig cap.
4613011	4614573	These games are going to be 17 gigs each.
4614593	4615634	That's the other thing too.
4617717	4626407	Another point that I brought up because I actually responded to that article is, okay, let's assume that you can dump this game to your hard drive.
4626587	4628748	How fucking big is that hard drive going to be?
4628848	4630369	And how much is it going to fucking cost?
4630669	4636171	Because, you know, the prices of these hard drives from... I understand, data storage is cheap.
4636551	4641534	But data storage is not cheap when it's sold by a company in a proprietary format.
4641994	4649717	For example, you could buy a 320 gigabyte hard drive or whatever from Microsoft and it's going to run you like 200 bucks.
4649837	4654879	And I can get like a 2 terabyte drive for about the same price if I bought it for my PC.
4655280	4655480	So...
4656460	4660442	Unless they open that shit up like they do with the PS3, props to them for that.
4661202	4663303	I mean, why wouldn't they do that?
4663363	4672787	I mean, after all, these guys are so fucking hungry for money that, of course, they're going to take the opportunity to, you know, oh, hey, you need that two terabyte drive because you're going to have to store all those games that we're going to make.
4674227	4675488	You can't take without giving back.
4677100	4682503	Um, I stand by my earlier statement that this is going to cause a video game crash, and it's going to drive the game market underground.
4684464	4693749	I mean, not like, you know, not like, oh, the back alleys and whatever, but it's going to be, games will be sold at flea markets, and GameStops will sell nothing but used games, because people don't want new games anymore.
4694029	4694869	It's not worth shit.
4695010	4701293	And also, when you think about, you know, technology getting the way it is right now, and how expensive consoles are getting, you know, meh.
4701673	4703614	Maybe people will actually go to PCs.
4704034	4704674	Hey, look at that.
4704754	4705614	PCs.
4705634	4707955	Where you can get games and actually own stuff.
4708515	4714277	You don't have to worry about used game sales because there's just sales on video games.
4715857	4717758	There's Steam and that kind of stuff.
4718038	4719279	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4742637	4743738	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4772937	4774758	Could this be how the hacks are happening?
4776499	4779281	No, I say no because I've never sold a hard drive back and I was hacked.
4779661	4781042	I have all my drives I've ever had.
4781142	4784864	And on top of that, I don't think it stores the actual credit card information on your hard drive.
4784924	4790628	It's tied to your network account or your Xbox Live account and it's downloaded from there.
4790708	4792909	But is it possible it's ever written it to the drive?
4793089	4793309	Ever?
4793730	4797612	It's possible that it might be in a cache file or something like that.
4797712	4800554	Maybe that is possible, but
4800814	4803516	Now Microsoft responded to the whole thing.
4803576	4806259	So let me read Microsoft's response because obviously this is important.
4806719	4809942	Quote, we are conducting a thorough investigation into the researchers' claims.
4810002	4817308	We have requested information that will allow us to investigate the console in question and have still not received the information needed to replicate the researchers' claims.
4817368	4821231	So they're deflecting a little bit in the opening like we don't have the information yet.
4822253	4826894	I somehow doubt that they actually wipe the drive with like zero byte writing but I think it's just like format
4851109	4853771	That was not a 100% denial either.
4854432	4855072	Did you notice that?
4855192	4857434	That was not a firm, no, this is crap.
4857855	4861798	That was a, we haven't been able to investigate it and it's unlikely.
4862098	4863399	But that wasn't a no.
4868344	4879333	I mean, maybe for legal reasons they can't say no because if they do say no and it ends up they were wrong, now we can class action lawsuit them, Xbox Live agreement be damned because this is on the actual hardware itself.
4881038	4882440	I'm not scared God, I...
4900537	4909082	I know I'm a total hypocrite saying this because my credit card info is on my Xbox, but if you haven't put it on there yet, I would advise you just don't.
4909162	4911022	Don't ever give those damn things your credit card.
4911503	4912763	Use the cards that you buy in stores.
4913164	4914504	It's the only safe way to do it.
4915725	4916485	Sad, but true.
4917406	4919467	All right, meanwhile, DarkSakura, what do you got for us?
4922208	4928011	Well, actually, I was answering a question from Nish, I guess, asking what my favorite console is of all time.
4928806	4929647	from our chat room, yeah?
4929747	4933691	Yeah, I'd probably say the PC Engine Duo, Turbo Duo.
4933971	4934351	Why is that?
4934832	4938716	Dracula X. Super Nintendo for me, easy.
4938796	4940698	Super Nintendo was the best console they ever did, I think.
4941999	4951088	So anyway, you remember we had actually mentioned a rumor about Zipper being closed, Zipper Interactive, that created SOCOM, the developer of SOCOM?
4951108	4951908	That was last week, yeah.
4952209	4953410	Well, Sony confirmed it.
4954810	4956191	but other than that, bye bye
4984304	4997095	Well, I mean, I guess most of us kind of assumed last week's was probably true anyway, but it's unfortunate that it was confirmed, but... It doesn't... When you say a rumor, you should always give it some closure.
4997175	4997375	Sure.
4997876	4998916	They got the closure all right.
4999117	5006643	If it's true that these new consoles are gonna lock out used games, I bet this is gonna get a lot more frequent.
5006863	5011447	It's gonna be... If your company doesn't develop for PC, you're gonna be in trouble.
5011807	5012568	That's all I have to say.
5013457	5016139	I wonder what the project was that was cancelled.
5016900	5017620	SOCOM 5?
5018541	5019001	Maybe.
5019121	5019522	Maybe?
5020542	5022164	Just SOCOM on the Vita?
5022244	5022624	Who knows?
5023064	5023164	Eh.
5023384	5023825	Probably.
5024345	5028168	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and what is coming out near you soon.
5029143	5032767	Well, the drought has begun again, so not a whole lot this week.
5033208	5037292	Titanic Mystery on Nintendo DS and on the Wii.
5037432	5040755	Oh, to celebrate the release of the movie all over again.
5040775	5045180	I know, it's talking about the Titanic 2 and how there's a bomb on the Titanic.
5045220	5046001	I think we talked about this.
5047322	5048723	Sounds like the plot of Speed 2.
5050325	5055151	There's also, of course, Funky Barn from Ubisoft.
5056392	5056933	3DS game.
5058114	5061938	Fallout and Oblivion are getting a double pack on Xbox 360 and PC.
5064581	5070204	Connect Star Wars out this week as well as the Connect Star Wars Limited Edition Connect Star Wars Oh, that's finally out?
5070244	5070464	Yes.
5070584	5071184	I'll be damned.
5071424	5072845	Connect Star Wars is finally out.
5074006	5080929	If you happen to shop at GameStop or Nintendo online, Xenoblade Chronicles is out on the Wii this week.
5084691	5086653	And... That's it.
5086833	5088254	Finally, Xenoblade Chronicles.
5088294	5089855	That's one a lot of people are looking forward to.
5089875	5092076	Yeah, gotta say that.
5092216	5097320	Oh, and originally it was going to be a Devil May Cry HD collection this week on PS3 and 360.
5097920	5102183	However, Capcom dropped the street date on that, so it's out now.
5102763	5103784	Like, canceled?
5104084	5105985	They're no longer street dating it.
5106066	5111209	So it was basically, before it was, okay, you have to hold your copies until Tuesday, then they're like, ah, just sell it.
5111429	5112450	Maybe it got leaked or something?
5113091	5113391	Who knows?
5113451	5113912	I don't.
5114273	5115875	Yeah, it got leaked years ago.
5116076	5119281	Devil's May Cry HD Edition is not like one of those games like people have to have right now.
5119361	5121124	It's like you already played it before.
5121164	5123208	Yeah, it doesn't look all that HD either.
5124109	5124510	Just saying.
5124969	5126170	Alright, let's go to Japan.
5126410	5130113	In Japan, not a whole lot coming out, but there are a few things.
5130193	5134737	On the Nintendo 3DS, Puyo Puyo Kansatsu Niki.
5134837	5136539	That is not Puyo Puyo, there's a big difference.
5136599	5139541	Puyo Puyo, which looks like this big fat cat.
5139861	5140101	Yeah.
5140402	5145666	But it's not really Nintendogs or Nintendcats, although I guess it does actually look a little similar to that.
5145786	5149829	I've seen that cat a bunch of places before, so I think it's like from a manga.
5149890	5150910	Like a character or something.
5150990	5152592	Actually, it does look a lot like Nintendogs or...
5153492	5154372	That looks like Shermie.
5154392	5156633	It does not look like Shermie.
5157553	5158953	Shermie is not that fat.
5159974	5160874	And she's not orange.
5161054	5161534	A plus.
5162134	5162454	All right.
5162954	5165395	Going to... Let's check out the Vita.
5165415	5168156	See what's coming out on the Vita this week over in Japan.
5169916	5170416	There we go.
5171216	5171596	Nothing.
5171937	5173577	Unless you want a portable charger.
5173857	5176138	It's an official first party portable charger.
5176858	5177478	Hey, hey.
5178698	5181960	on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3.
5182380	5183781	Let's go to the 360 first.
5184542	5186943	They're also getting Star Wars this week and the console.
5187003	5188464	So it's not just America that's getting that.
5188544	5190265	Japan is getting their version as well.
5190805	5197829	And lastly on the PlayStation 3, Borderlands Game of the Year Edition comes out in Japan and Mahjong Dream Club.
5199210	5199530	Yay?
5200451	5202772	Is that tying in with like Dream Club?
5203813	5204333	The anime?
5204353	5205414	It looks like it, actually.
5205554	5206994	Like the chicks?
5207214	5207734	Actually, it is.
5207934	5208734	Oh, God.
5209154	5211955	This is why you knew about this, Loki.
5211975	5212655	Classy.
5213676	5219657	It's ladies in swimsuits, if you would like, with big old boobies playing mahjong.
5219817	5220077	Yes.
5221598	5222238	Titty-jong.
5223398	5224018	Well, you know what?
5224438	5225899	More people might be into mahjong.
5226019	5226719	That's true.
5227999	5229380	That's the sound the eyes make.
5229720	5230140	Mahjong!
5233755	5235157	How about the UK, DarkSakura?
5235732	5237614	On the third, we have Star Wars Connect.
5237754	5240436	We have Devil May Cry HD Collection and Wheels of Destruction.
5240996	5242437	On the fourth, Diabolical Pitch.
5243558	5246060	On the fifth, Rhythm Thief and the Emperor's Treasure.
5246220	5248122	And on the sixth, Shoot Many Robots.
5250083	5250724	Many Robots.
5250844	5251224	Shoot them.
5251705	5251965	Yep.
5252485	5252786	All right.
5252806	5253126	That's it.
5253426	5253686	All right.
5254327	5261813	Well, we're going to take a moment to go in the gaming archive and find a game that DarkSakura thinks, hey, you ungrateful little brats.
5263587	5267608	Although tonight we were reminiscing about old times a little bit, so everybody was reminiscing tonight a bit.
5267628	5272289	But we're going to reminisce again, not with an old version of our show, but with the classic game of the week.
5273469	5276929	DarkSakura, what did you pick from the archives this week as the classic game of the week?
5277149	5277649	Street Fighter.
5278370	5279070	And that's no joke.
5279770	5281390	No, that's true for the truth.
5282130	5285651	Although Capcom fighting games have become a bit of a joke in recent years.
5286131	5289391	Well, I figured with everything happening, I may as well just go right to the source.
5289411	5290852	So let's talk about Street Fighter.
5290892	5291752	That's right.
5293380	5301645	So yeah, it came out in 1987, of course by Capcom, and it was their first fighting game that they put out.
5302605	5311770	And it was actually one of the first ones that had a six-button controller and had commands that had special moves.
5312471	5314912	So this basically started the whole big thing for us.
5316653	5320715	The version that came out on the TurboGrafx CD was called Fighting Street in 1988.
5322336	5329821	And that actually came out on the Virtual Console in November 2009, and the same for the UK.
5331662	5342730	So basically, you have one-on-one matches against the computer opponent, and then each matches three rounds, and you have to defeat each opponent in less than 30 seconds.
5343590	5351696	If the match ends before the fighter is knocked out, then whoever has the most energy will make it to the next round, basically.
5352516	5353598	Fighting Games do today.
5354619	5357162	You have to win two rounds to win and move forward.
5357622	5361927	And if the third round is a tie, then the computer wins by default.
5364284	5367628	So, I mean, basically, this started the whole thing.
5368228	5373854	This, you know, having the moves and everything, having... See, look, it's the Shoryuken, and he's fighting Sagat.
5373914	5380121	And that also started the computer cheating every time, because that's bullshit, that if it's still a tie, the computer just wins.
5380141	5382904	Well, yeah, but actually in that case, that's actually somebody playing Ryu.
5384405	5395932	Um... So there were, um... There was a deluxe version of the game that had an 8-way joystick and then two large mechatronic pads for punches and kicks.
5396752	5400875	So it was basically, um... The harder you hit, the harder your punch or your kick was.
5401415	5404937	And then the later version came out with the six attack buttons.
5404957	5409160	You know, the three heavy punches and three... Oh, the three punches and the three kicks.
5410580	5411221	So, um...
5413304	5415970	There were all kinds of different moves.
5416511	5417493	Basically, you had...
5419626	5423970	The Psycho Fire, which was the Hadouken, and the Dragon Punch and the Hurricane Kick.
5424010	5428513	I mean, they were all the same moves that followed over.
5430254	5434438	So for the characters in this one, basically, you play as Ryu.
5435578	5438341	And if you have a second player, then you play as Ken.
5438361	5440482	That's why they had the same moves and everything.
5441843	5448709	And he also, basically, the two-player mode is basically Ryu versus Ken.
5450575	5454819	So you had different opponents in single-player mode.
5455499	5475516	You had Retsu, who was a Kenpo instructor, Geki, who had a claw, and Joe, who was another karate guy, Mike, who, from what I understand, became Mike... I think was actually, if I'm right, he became Mike Bison in Street Fighter II, which...
5476537	5489900	as we know over here he was called Balrog which was Vega's name and Vega was who was Bison over here and I've gone across side yeah that's how it works
5490689	5497956	So we had Lee, who was Chinese boxing, and Gen, who was a professional killer.
5498016	5500719	And Gen came back in Street Fighter Alpha, or Street Fighter Zero.
5502000	5505884	And so did Birdie, who was the wrestler slash boxer.
5506465	5507446	He also was in there.
5507466	5509828	And then there was one named Eagle, who was a bodyguard.
5510889	5512411	And then you had your...
5513912	5521055	Your last two opponents you had, Adon, who was Muay Thai, and he actually came back for Street Fighter Alpha as well.
5521755	5523756	He was the one with the very interesting hair.
5524376	5526317	And Sagat, who was the boss.
5526497	5528998	And now Sagat, of course, came back for just about every version.
5531366	5540432	So it came out, it was produced by Takashi Nishiyama, who we've seen as Piston Takashi.
5542013	5543633	Are you seeing a two player?
5544454	5550898	Oh, I was just looking at that because the other video ran out, so I went and looked at some other matches.
5551804	5561528	It was planned by Hiroshi Matsumoto, and the two of them actually went on to do a bunch of games for SNK, including Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting.
5563689	5567270	And then they came back to work on Street Fighter IV.
5567430	5570551	And we all know Inafune, Keiji, right?
5571532	5572012	Megaman.
5573512	5577314	Basically, he also designed the character portraits in Street Fighter.
5579125	5583146	and, uh, so we've got, like I said, there were two different versions in the arcade.
5583166	5588968	There was the regular version, um, that had the six button and the deluxe one that had the pressure-sensitive pads.
5589309	5591990	So you could basically hit the pad and you hit it as hard as the pad did.
5593010	5593090	Um...
5595302	5596323	Basically, in the U.S.
5596443	5607490	version, well, I'd say in any non-Japanese version, I should say, Ken and Ryu were dubbed in English so that their moves were like Psycho Fire, Dragon Punch, and Hurricane Kick.
5608371	5611353	And then later versions just left the voices in Japanese.
5612413	5616896	So, basically, when you get into Street Fighter IV, it actually has both versions of it.
5617837	5617917	Um...
5619904	5620907	So yeah, the home versions.
5620967	5623392	There was, like I said, Fighting Street for the TurboGrafx.
5623753	5624896	They had an arranged soundtrack.
5625818	5625998	And...
5629095	5630196	This was interesting, too.
5632076	5640879	Because it didn't have a six-button controller, your strength of your moves were determined by how long you held the subsequent kick or punch button.
5641339	5646181	They later did six-button controllers, though, when it's saved for TurboGrafx.
5646961	5649782	Anyway, did you know, Rob, that there was a Commodore 64 version?
5651332	5652333	Actually, I did.
5652413	5653134	Isn't that sad?
5653194	5655276	But yes, I did know about the Commodore 64 version.
5655336	5656177	I think I had it.
5657359	5660562	Well, there was also one for the ZX Spectrum.
5660682	5663625	It didn't play that great, by the way, because the Commodore 64 only has one button.
5664486	5667970	There's MS-DOS, Amiga, and Atari ST that came out by U.S.
5667990	5668070	Gold.
5669491	5681261	and, um, they were, uh, I believe published by Tiertex and they said that they actually came out with their, um, with an unofficial sequel called Human Killing Machines.
5683342	5684143	Kind of interesting, huh?
5685484	5686305	Of course, um, U.S.
5686345	5688567	Gold also was the one that published by Commando in 1943, so.
5688587	5688747	Now, um...
5695575	5706282	The, uh, as far as this, I mean, it was considered to be one of the games of the year, as stated by Sinclair User.
5708183	5712946	And C++VG said it had no lasting appeal whatsoever.
5715027	5717168	Well, how did that last?
5717668	5720090	Lucky that somebody felt differently and gave it a sequel, huh?
5720523	5723045	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5742603	5753051	and that's available for Windows PC and the Capcom Classics Collection Remix for PSP and Capcom Classics Volume 2 for PS2 and Xbox.
5754432	5754773	Alright.
5754793	5755833	Is that it?
5756394	5756834	That's it.
5756874	5762098	Your classic game of the week, Street Fighter or Fighting Street, I guess, right?
5762138	5762979	Depending on where you are.
5764100	5765141	For a variety of systems.
5765161	5769084	You could just be doing nothing apparently but shorty again over and over and over and over.
5769964	5774090	Alright, we're going to move right into some rapid fire news tonight.
5774110	5780259	If things seem a little bit compressed, that's because we compressed our regular show because of the April Fool's thing we did at the beginning.
5780339	5782482	So yes, it is moving at a different pace tonight.
5782963	5785246	So let's just go right into rapid fire news.
5785287	5785467	Loki.
5786528	5791530	Alright, let's talk a little bit about some Easter eggs.
5791990	5793050	And this is kind of funny.
5793930	5799632	There was actually an Easter egg that was found on the Nintendo 64 version of GoldenEye.
5800252	5804614	It was actually an emulator for the ZX Spectrum.
5805094	5805875	Thanks for watching!
5823917	5834852	The company, well, Rare, they had also, I guess, developed games for the ZX Spectrum back in the day.
5835013	5838037	So that's kind of interesting that that was on there.
5840260	5843141	Um, and then this is kind of disappointing news.
5843361	5847162	Uh, Kid Icarus Uprising actually began as a Wii game.
5847622	5850923	Um, and it was being developed on PC as well.
5851363	5856044	Um, I would imagine it's the dev kits or PCs, but as a Wii game, I, yes, exactly.
5856084	5857985	I kind of think it should have stayed a Wii game too.
5858065	5858305	Yeah.
5858405	5860286	It would have been fucking awesome as a Wii game.
5860586	5865147	Not to say that they couldn't bring it to consoles later on, but it would have been fucking awesome as a Wii game.
5865927	5876334	Now that I'm playing it and thinking about the controls too, I can see how it totally was a Wii game and it would have been because you could use the little thumb stick to move and you aim at the TV.
5876815	5879516	It actually makes a lot more sense as a Wii game.
5880677	5882879	Although the 3D is beautiful in it though.
5884800	5886641	Here's the thing that's really disappointing though.
5886661	5891865	They actually have video from the game running on the Wii version and
5893005	5893706	It's gorgeous.
5893826	5894987	It still looks gorgeous.
5895007	5895347	Oh, wow.
5895407	5896247	I didn't see the video.
5896267	5896848	That's awesome.
5896888	5900050	Yeah, it's just... Wait, is it on the story here?
5900090	5900911	It's on the story.
5901191	5908416	Yeah, they actually show... It looks like... I mean, it's basically what you see in the 3DS version, just minus any enemies and stuff like that.
5908576	5911358	But, I mean, wouldn't that have been awesome?
5911438	5912798	This is the first level.
5914360	5921624	This looks like it could just be the screen from the 3DS one, but... But, yeah, that's the prototype version that they had.
5921644	5922245	All right, cool.
5924227	5928591	So sad that it could have been... They should still do it as a PC game.
5929412	5931094	There's still time to put it out as a Wii game.
5931114	5931514	That's right.
5931534	5933016	Wii U game.
5934217	5934617	You never know.
5936679	5937981	So yeah.
5938902	5939382	Disappointing.
5940083	5940684	Very disappointing.
5941544	5970251	less disappointing is the success of Journey which is a PlayStation Network game I really didn't talk enough about because it came out at the time I was getting back into Mass Effect but this is a great experience on the PlayStation 3 and again I really suggest you guys check it out however it sounds like a lot of you already have Journey is now the fastest selling Sony Computer Entertainment America region PSN game in all of recorded history so check that out the honor before that was Infamous 2 Festival of Blood so
5971692	5978777	Anyhow, so Journey has been doing very, very, very well online and April 10th is when the soundtrack is coming out.
5978817	5982560	You can get that either on the PlayStation Store or you can do it in iTunes.
5983081	5986584	So that's going to be coming out on April 10th and it does have a gorgeous soundtrack with it too.
5986684	5990727	So again, Journey on PlayStation Network is, it's a trip.
5990927	5991548	I like it a lot.
5991868	5996732	And they're going to be doing LittleBigPlanet stuff for Journey as well.
5996852	5998233	Yes, I did read about that.
5998273	5999634	Someone needs to get it for me.
6001536	6002816	Maybe for your birthday.
6003016	6004958	Maybe.
6005158	6011381	If PC games are more your thing, Audiosurf, especially if you like music games, is probably one that you've checked out before.
6012042	6012582	Well, guess what?
6012622	6013683	They're not going to stop there.
6013783	6017025	There's a website for a little something called Audiosurf Air.
6017705	6018646	Who knows what that is?
6018786	6024731	It could be a mobile version of the game, but it sounds like it's more likely a sequel to the original AudioSurf.
6025091	6027073	There is some screenshots on the website.
6027293	6033378	Of course, everything is subject to change, but it does look like, I don't know, the little machine looks a little more like a boat or something now.
6033438	6035440	So it is definitely possible they've changed some things up.
6036341	6040744	I think they are recruiting for beta signups right now, so you can check that out on their website, which is...
6041625	6051170	It's air.audio-surf.com air.audio-surf.com That's a lot of punctuation.
6051710	6052190	So there you go.
6052230	6052950	Audio Surf Air.
6053250	6053671	DarkSakura?
6054771	6060114	Well, in other news, Rob, playing with your game.
6060314	6061234	I got a swap note.
6061274	6061955	I had to check it.
6062075	6062675	Is it Kat?
6063984	6068407	I sent a swap note earlier, and it's my little April Fool's joke.
6068587	6070548	Now, did you get the one from Reggie?
6071729	6080594	I did get the one from Reggie, and you can use him as a level 5 guy in Find Me or whatever, but he got scared off by the monster, and I didn't get to use him at all, and that pissed me the fuck off.
6080614	6081315	Fucking asshole.
6081535	6082295	I know, right?
6082696	6083556	So, news.
6084897	6085938	I had to give you a hard time, Rob.
6086778	6088379	Mortal Kombat Vita has a release date.
6089339	6093461	It's going to be coming out in Europe on May 4th.
6095382	6097843	And I don't see what the American date is.
6097963	6098183	U.S.
6098263	6099063	is May 1st.
6099103	6099743	May 1st, right?
6099784	6100184	Yeah.
6100824	6105806	So, basically, it's going to have touchscreen-enabled fatalities and a challenge tower.
6106306	6107387	Ooh.
6107407	6109047	And 150 Vita-exclusive missions.
6110188	6110468	Ooh.
6110748	6112309	The Vita challenge tower could be neat.
6112409	6115110	I mean, they're going to incorporate a lot of the Vita stuff into it, so...
6115603	6116585	Awesome Knots
6130654	6139279	It's a multiplayer arena beat-em-up that's going to be on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade on May 2nd, put out by Ranamo Games.
6139979	6149044	So you basically beat people up in teams of three online or via split-screen locally, and there's no price tag on it yet.
6151946	6153186	Ranamo is a Dutch developer.
6153927	6154187	Nice.
6154947	6156268	They put out Swords and Soldiers.
6157703	6159304	All righty.
6159384	6161386	We're going to get into the Fugle Question of the Week.
6161586	6166989	Actually, though, I think I want to do an unscripted break just because the recording is starting to get a little long.
6167329	6170411	So I need to save the recording so we don't lose it so I get the temp space back.
6170812	6172733	So we're going to do a little technical break.
6173313	6175275	And when we come back, I'm going to do just a two-minute song here.
6175295	6183340	When we come back, we will do more of Orange Launch Radio, including the Fugle Question of the Week, FUs of the Week, Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR, and...
6183780	6189387	your phone calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR we'll get to those right after a quick impromptu break here
6195945	6202669	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on this April Fool's Day edition, episode number 452 of our show.
6203169	6208953	And if you tuned in late tonight, you missed a little bit of retro OLR at the top of the show, so check it out when it hits the podcast feed.
6208993	6216137	Yes, it will all be in the... Somebody was asking if they could get a recording of the beginning of the show tonight, and I was like, it'll be in the podcast, so it'll be all there.
6216477	6224322	Songs and all, because we very intentionally pick songs that were from the games themselves, so they're licensed a little differently, so we can...
6224782	6225203	I don't know
6248786	6252251	Alright, anyhow, let's get back into the show.
6253012	6253893	Fugle Question of the Week!
6254173	6257778	It's where we ask you guys a question on Facebook and Google+, and we call it Fugle.
6266533	6269855	No Bites on Google this week, which has me convinced nobody is on Google+.
6294850	6313153	and since I'm being forced to move to this stupid timeline thing on Facebook I like it Google Plus doesn't seem so bad and our page is now timeline you can get an ad for that by the way I think I will I hate the way timeline looks I hate it I hate the left and the right side stuff I love it well I hate it
6314178	6316040	Alright, here it is, the FUVO question of the week.
6316861	6324549	What is your favorite urban legend or April Fool's joke in the gaming community that turned out to be fake or perhaps even real years later?
6324929	6328733	For example, Shang Long, Sonic and Super Smash Brothers, Melee, and so forth.
6329734	6331036	Be sure to sign your comments.
6332638	6334580	Obviously, if you wrote on Facebook, then you already did.
6336360	6341802	DarkTetsuya writes, honestly, I don't think anything could top Shang Long from EGM April 92.
6342482	6344643	Wow, he even quoted the magazine and the date.
6345363	6350425	Keep in mind that this was even before we had the internet, much less as big as it is today.
6351165	6356267	And you have to give the editors credit for sticking the find the AFD joke contest right underneath it.
6356987	6383085	I agree, that was a pretty epic troll on behalf of that magazine I remember they used to do these epic April Fool's jokes every year and they kind of set the benchmark but I loved when their jokes would become realities like Ermac in Mortal Kombat 1 ended up being a real thing that was kind of funny Cody T writes us and says one that happened just recently, Assassin's Creed Connect and there's a video trailer for it and everything it's actually pretty hilarious
6383510	6385032	and he linked us to the video trailer there.
6385813	6386414	I didn't see this.
6386775	6387436	I watched it.
6388738	6396089	It looks like the normal Kinect videos and you see this guy do this backflip in his living room and stuff.
6397371	6399334	It just gets more and more ridiculous.
6400397	6407620	Porkchop writes and says, how about the Final Fantasy VII tech demo for PlayStation 3 that had everybody lose their minds and assume there'd be a remake?
6407800	6408981	Ultimate fanboy troll.
6409421	6418965	Well, to be fair, that wasn't an April Fool's joke, but we did say urban legend or April Fool's joke, so that was a huge troll on somebody's part.
6419385	6420846	You have to wonder if they didn't consider it.
6420866	6422466	Can I add mine in here real quick?
6422486	6422927	Sure, of course.
6423167	6423947	Yeah, you get to answer two.
6424147	6432030	Remember when they were going to do Mega Man Legends 3 and then they said they were going to put out a demo for it and that you'd have to pay for the demo?
6432631	6434652	And then they said, fuck you, we're not going to do it.
6434692	6435172	Ha ha.
6435692	6437313	Yeah, that was a... That wasn't a troll.
6437353	6438553	That was just fucking mean.
6439054	6439854	That's what that was.
6440578	6449564	Which, by the way, and I do follow them on Facebook still, 100,000 strong for Mega Man Legends 3 to return or whatever that is.
6450304	6452626	They're up to 80,000 likes.
6453506	6455347	That's more than a million moms, right?
6455667	6456048	Yeah.
6456248	6461251	So, I mean, hey, if you haven't liked them yet, maybe you should.
6463874	6468036	This just in, there are more Mega Man fans than moms, apparently.
6468136	6468657	Go figure.
6469237	6470258	Alright, moving on.
6471258	6471959	I kid, I kid.
6472719	6475181	Tyler M says, Goken in Street Fighter 2.
6475341	6476321	I don't remember that one.
6476561	6481204	I do, because it was supposed to be Ryu and Ken's teacher, and now he's in Street Fighter 4.
6481924	6482525	Oh, how funny.
6483125	6483865	I forgot that one.
6483885	6486327	That must have been a little later after the Shang Long ordeal.
6487354	6491757	Phil G writes, I'm still not convinced the Diablo 3 release date is real.
6492417	6493958	That's a very valid concern, sir.
6494298	6495959	But we have people who are already playing the beta.
6496899	6499381	The beta's been out for a while now, though.
6499921	6501162	It's got to be sometime soon.
6501882	6503503	It was practically done in October.
6504944	6509746	You know there are some people that are concerned that the Gran Turismo 5 release date isn't accurate either.
6511587	6512728	Also a legitimate concern.
6512868	6512988	Yes.
6514616	6525472	Let's see, UnfoldedRaptor writes and says, when I was in third grade back in 2000, I feel so old.
6525672	6526453	Shut up.
6527214	6527735	All right.
6528155	6528676	Shush.
6531700	6534041	That was a great troll from Unfolded Raptor right there.
6534061	6534862	Good job, sir.
6534942	6535222	All right.
6536423	6544128	I used to tell my friend at school that if he threw flares in the corner of a certain room in Tomb Raider The Last Revelation, that it would skip him to the end of the game.
6544548	6549811	Well, he kept doing that, and it ticked him off that he had to restart the level again and again and waste his flares.
6550272	6559418	So he comes back and tells me the next day that if I went through the whole game of Star Fox 64 without doing a barrel roll, that at the end, Andross would come out and shake his butt.
6562950	6564971	I have to remember they're in third grade, so this is funny.
6565412	6570335	I played Star Fox 64 over and over for about a week before I was convinced that no such thing existed.
6570795	6574298	Years later, my friend told me he lied about Andross, and it served me right.
6574618	6579301	But deep down in my heart, I want to believe that such a secret ending actually exists.
6579961	6583264	This is an April Fool's prank that has stuck with me throughout the years.
6585385	6592230	I feel like this needs an animated GIF file of Andross shaking his butt with, I want to believe.
6597431	6616137	that's a good story what I like about that story is it really has nothing to do with gaming magazines or press but it's just like people trolling each other and that's that's great all right lastly uh Hunter R writes and says I remember last year this game that claimed to be Duke Nukem Forever came out except it was totally lame there are people who are still convinced that shit is real haha
6618089	6618991	I see what you did there.
6620233	6621115	I see what you did there.
6621496	6623900	Alright, that's it for our Fugle question of the week.
6623921	6627047	There's developers that think that the critics went too hard on them.
6633254	6636496	By the way, those are like the 9-11 conspiracy theories.
6636516	6638378	100,000 strong for bringing back Mega Man Legends 3.
6638678	6639438	They're up to 81,642.
6639478	6642941	That's actually been going up quite a bit.
6643801	6645763	So they keep that up.
6645843	6647884	You may be able to hit that before June.
6648585	6651046	I would go like the page, but I'm over it.
6653228	6654128	That's just where I'm at.
6654168	6654629	I'm over it.
6655669	6657330	Alright, let's get back into some more news, Loki.
6658311	6664474	Alright, well, unfortunately something that may not be coming back quite as soon as Mega Man Legends 3.
6667486	6685426	Two PSP games which had problems with their save files or they could be exploited to launch a homebrew emulator on the PlayStation Vita, basically through the PSP emulator on there.
6688209	6690110	and allow them to run unsigned code.
6690250	6707038	So before we knew about Motorstorm Arctic Rift that was taken off and now Hotshots Tennis or Everybody's Tennis in Europe has also been taken down because it was also being used in exploits to run homebrew on the Vita.
6708059	6716223	So that's what happens is these people release a method that requires one of these games and then it goes away.
6717028	6717549	PlayStation Vita Hacked
6737066	6739867	I found that to be interesting, that they were using the old games to do it.
6739947	6741547	But it's only hacked within the emulator.
6741667	6745008	But the emulator isn't as strapped as it was on the PSP.
6745168	6746608	You can still do a little bit more.
6746928	6748889	You have a little bit more memory and stuff to work with.
6749469	6750889	But it's still within the emulator.
6750909	6753330	You don't actually have access to the whole Vita stuff yet.
6753470	6755450	But it allowed you to install Linux on the Vita?
6756230	6760751	It would allow you to run emulators and maybe ISOs.
6760851	6763492	I don't know about that, but at least emulators.
6766522	6794373	I'm surprised you didn't get in on this before it got shut down I don't download PSP games other than the ones I got for free and honestly I'm kind of over playing emulators on stuff right now if I want to play emulators I have my PSP still I have a Dingu that only plays emulators I don't really need another system to run homebrew stuff on right now
6795053	6797937	Death Jam Rapstar Death Jam Rapstar Death Jam Rapstar Death Jam Rapstar
6809890	6810250	I try not to.
6829500	6830761	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6855079	6863604	EMI is suing 4mm Games and Terminal Reality saying that songs were used in the game that they weren't entitled to.
6864564	6868227	Rapstar apparently got some songs from labels like Def Jam and so forth.
6868387	6875130	EMI says though it owned small percentages of other tracks that were nominally owned by other labels.
6875811	6876351	That's weird.
6876511	6877211	Yeah, I know, right?
6877511	6887813	Some of the examples include DJ Khaled's I'm So Hood, Lil Wayne's Got Money, which EMI said they own 10% of one of them and 30% of the other.
6888693	6889253	I know, right?
6889433	6899095	This is just me that multiple publishers... The way these things get bought and who finances it and so forth, I can kind of see where this happens.
6899135	6901816	But EMI says 54 tracks infringe on their rights.
6902216	6904476	They're going after $8 million in damages.
6905970	6910514	But the weird thing to me is that this game is kind of old now.
6910634	6912917	I think it was 2010 or 9.
6913197	6913898	I don't know.
6915339	6916120	It was that same E3.
6916280	6917461	It was October.
6918802	6919623	It was in October.
6919883	6923867	I remember seeing it at E3, and I want to say it was the same year that Game Room had come out.
6923907	6924868	So what year was Game Room?
6925609	6925849	Was that 2009?
6925889	6926369	I think it was 2009.
6926409	6926990	So, yeah.
6927010	6927110	Yeah.
6932290	6932770	Interesting.
6933591	6938596	It was 2010, actually.
6938696	6939076	Really?
6939937	6940397	All right.
6940417	6944201	2010, and yeah.
6945001	6946363	And they shut down the community site in 2011.
6946523	6947123	Dope.
6949786	6950086	All right.
6950766	6951727	Let's move on to the mailbag.
6952108	6953349	Every week you guys send us e-mails.
6954858	6956960	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6979738	6979798	Yay!
6979818	6979878	Yay!
7002691	7009694	They've always had free artistic reign, producing tons of exclusive comics and characters that never really gained traction elsewhere.
7010734	7017056	At the end of the 90s, Disney Italy decided to launch a couple of experiments, some successful, some less so, but all quite surprising.
7017096	7023518	These included P.K.N.A., a Marvel-slash-DC-style comic featuring Paper... Paper-y Nick?
7024139	7030261	Donald Duck's superhero alter ego as he fought aliens, time travelers, and mutants, featured violence and actual character deaths.
7031241	7032642	The most successful of the experiments.
7033002	7039046	This even got its own video game although that was based on the shitty third series that fans like to forget ever happened.
7039810	7040590	Can I say real quick?
7041370	7046112	The whole Epic Mickey thing, since it's nowhere else in our show row, I don't think we've covered it here.
7046452	7052333	There's that awesome new, I don't know if you heard, but with Epic Mickey 2, they're also doing the 3DS game.
7052353	7054894	Well, the 3DS isn't a port of Epic Mickey 2.
7054954	7057315	The 3DS game is a new Castle of Illusion game.
7057775	7058055	Ooh.
7058355	7058635	Right?
7058735	7065997	And they're doing stages like classic stages, but they're doing stuff like Tangled, and it's a bunch of new Disney movies in it too.
7066017	7066257	That's cool.
7066557	7067457	I'm like, sold!
7068398	7068958	Thank you very much.
7070178	7071719	Sounds better than the console one to me.
7072899	7073859	Well, to continue?
7075100	7075460	Yes, ma'am.
7075900	7078861	There's Witch, a shoujo manga-style comic.
7079241	7083903	This one also ran for quite a long time, also getting its own TV show and being turned into a real manga in Japan.
7084403	7088204	Not to be confused with Winx Club, which was a cheap and nasty knockoff of this.
7089978	7093601	Ritty Topolino, which is what you get when you cross Disney with Monty Python.
7094121	7105731	Short-lived but hilarious, things they did included publishing their Christmas issue in July, inserting deliberate mistakes into the comic strip, and one memorable feature celebrated the Olympics by having Mickey compete against a garden gnome.
7106751	7109914	The inanimate gnome not only won, but the end of many also dumps Mickey for it.
7111152	7113475	There's Mickey Mouse Mystery Magazine, the darkest of the bunch.
7113936	7118342	Mickey is a hard-boiled detective in his own noir comic, solving mysteries and dealing with bad guys.
7119103	7126833	This was so dark later, issues tried to soften the story by making it look like Mickey was just watching the episode as a film rather than him being the actual protagonist.
7127894	7136398	Then in the early 2000s, Disney Italy got a new director who decided all this awesome teen-oriented stuff was too bold and basically killed off every one of these projects, which is a great shame.
7136538	7137999	They all deserved a lot more recognition.
7138579	7148303	Unfortunately, PQNA and MMMM never made it to the States, so your only chance of reading these fine series is to learn Italian or look for fan-translated scans on the net.
7148644	7155027	But yeah, I would love to see some of the edgier characters in Epic Mickey, too, but since they're virtually unknown outside of Italy, not much chance of that, eh?
7156147	7158388	Anyway, late and take care, Picaruno.
7159229	7162571	Thank you for the email, Picaruno, and just for you, since you brought it up.
7179477	7180098	Next email.
7181519	7187944	And this is actually from... There was a link from the Star Tribune.
7188525	7195750	Last year, Best Buy lost a staggering $1.2 billion as it was deeply discounted merchandise to keep pace with rivals Amazon and Walmart.
7196711	7203377	All in all, Best Buy hopes to shed $800 million over the next three years, saving the company plans to use...
7204759	7204939	So, wow.
7217591	7219012	Best Buy Best Buy Best Buy Best Buy Best Buy
7236860	7239441	But yeah, Best Buy is going to have to be aggressive if they want to stay competitive.
7240282	7252588	It will probably help that more states are forcing Amazon to charge sales tax because there's a lot of people that use Amazon simply because they don't have to pay tax when they buy on Amazon, but that's going to be changing, unfortunately or fortunately, depending on how you look at it.
7254524	7269125	Next email I have a neighbor of mine who owns a fairly large pasture On this pasture he allows a number of animals to freely graze Horses, cows, sheep, whatever On the fence that lines the property is a series of signs that all say the same thing Free manure, inquire at the house
7270046	7271588	By now manure, he means bullshit.
7271988	7274170	Fresh new, high quality bullshit.
7274491	7276293	My neighbor's bullshit is free to anyone.
7277774	7279496	You just have to haul it away yourself.
7280137	7284541	As I looked at my Twitter feed on Wednesday, I began to wonder why people aren't all a Twitter about my neighbor's bullshit.
7285462	7285582	Yum!
7313394	7318919	Mainly because no one actually cares about actual bullshit Did you see the ad today for the Chick-fil-A steak sandwich?
7319100	7323804	Yes, I did That was pretty funny Is that it for emails or we have one more?
7324004	7332312	We have one more, but I wondered if you had a rebuttal for Why is real bullshit not as talked about as the bullshit people actually care about?
7334932	7337534	Because your neighbor's not famous and doesn't make video game systems.
7337574	7339015	The end.
7339235	7343418	There's a lot of game sites that run with bullshit or else they'd have nothing else to publish.
7344178	7349682	Speaking of shit, EA is still up for grabs for Worst Company in America.
7349702	7360869	So if you go to Consumerist.com and vote, I believe tomorrow is when they're having... I don't know if it's tomorrow or maybe the early part of next week that they're actually voting for the semifinals.
7361209	7361370	So...
7362210	7363311	They can do it.
7363572	7367916	And this year, they're also giving away three different golden poos.
7367936	7370840	They're going to have the golden poo, the silver poo, and the bronze poo this year.
7371140	7371520	Wow.
7371701	7374824	So they still have a chance as long as they win next round.
7375325	7377207	Well, congratulations.
7377627	7377907	Yay.
7378368	7379069	Two emails left.
7379830	7380170	Excuse me?
7383206	7383946	Yes, I had to burp.
7384086	7384307	Oh well.
7410872	7411593	Good pick.
7412454	7417498	After anxiously connecting all of the cables and the single controller, I was relieved to find the PS1 was still kicking.
7417878	7420921	And better yet, I jammed to Don't Stop Me Now as a celebration anthem.
7421001	7421762	That song is great.
7422062	7424824	I love the scene in Shaun of the Dead where they're beating up the zombie to that song.
7425024	7425665	That's the best.
7426506	7429228	I haven't touched a PS1 since 2000, back when I was nine.
7429648	7430009	Shut up.
7431650	7433372	The nostalgia began to return to me.
7433432	7436634	I'm not enjoying all this age of our listeners this week.
7437575	7447764	I remember being blown away by games like Einhander, Gran Turismo, and Twisted Metal My question to you guys is this With my first ever PS1, what game should I immediately own?
7448465	7452889	Also, what were the seminal titles of the PS1 era?
7453490	7460476	I like all types of games, RPGs, platformers, horror, sports, fighting rhythm, you name it Also, where can I even find PS1 games anymore?
7460916	7463719	Thanks in advance, love the show, keep up the good work, Randy from Texas
7464178	7467300	Flea Markets, you can find a lot of PlayStation 1 games that still... Amazon.
7468141	7468601	Oh, really?
7468741	7469882	They still sell PlayStation 1 games?
7470122	7471543	People sell stuff on Amazon all the time.
7471623	7472103	eBay.
7472844	7473204	Half.
7473584	7476046	Castlevania Symphony of the Night, you should own right now.
7476226	7477407	Yes, you definitely should own that one.
7477967	7478487	Jumping Flash.
7479048	7483831	If you enjoy music games at all, Parappa the Rapper and its sequel, Um Jam Malami.
7485694	7491436	I also... They changed the whole import thing on the PS Slim, didn't they?
7492176	7492436	Yeah.
7492476	7497057	Because, yeah, that was the one that you had to use the memory card thing.
7499197	7499918	I never had a Slim.
7499958	7503278	I just had the old one that we had the... The thing that plugs in the back?
7503418	7503999	Yeah.
7504519	7507739	You might as well get a Final Fantasy VII copy, too, because that was a must.
7507779	7509660	Get Final Fantasy VII.
7509680	7509720	Um...
7510228	7513590	Einhander, of course, you mentioned it.
7513810	7515671	Even Ergeis.
7516571	7520273	I freaking loved Ergeis because of the RPG mode in Ergeis.
7521174	7521274	R4.
7522555	7522975	R4, yes.
7523415	7524636	And get a JogCon.
7525476	7526777	Don't get a JogCon.
7527217	7528118	Really not worth it.
7528838	7531900	I bought a JogCon and I was like, wow, this is crap.
7531920	7532680	You know what you need?
7533120	7534201	Wipe out with the NegCon.
7534321	7535742	What if I have a JogCon still?
7536122	7537083	I've got two of them.
7537323	7538363	And of course, Ridge Racer.
7539164	7539384	That was R4.
7540370	7541531	Oh, Herp Derp.
7541651	7542491	Ridge Racer Revolution.
7543992	7546733	But Wipeout with an egg con is probably one of the best experiences.
7546753	7548193	That's what I was thinking of was Ridge Racer Revolution.
7550434	7551055	God, what else?
7551515	7558538	Well, I mean, I just picked up Bust a Move 2 Arcade Edition, which is literally the best version of Bust a Move you can find.
7560279	7560859	Chrono Cross?
7561079	7561559	Chrono Cross.
7562680	7563600	Chrono Trigger re-release.
7564100	7566521	You gotta get Bubsy because that was such a high quality game.
7566541	7567322	Ah, don't troll.
7567802	7568262	Don't troll.
7569437	7571359	All right, so good luck finding your PlayStation game.
7571459	7573140	And just for you, just for you.
7591374	7597138	Maybe you should just go get a PlayStation 3 and get a SingStar Queen or a rock band and all the Queen songs.
7597358	7598459	How about The Last Demon?
7598599	7599220	All right, how about it?
7600200	7601001	Greetings, OLR.
7601041	7602201	It's your friendly neighborhood turtle.
7602821	7603642	Question of the week.
7603802	7607343	What game are you looking forward to most this year, not including January through March?
7608063	7609444	Also, a comment on Skyrim.
7610504	7619407	I almost never buy games day one because of costs, which I believe are too high, but I did buy Skyrim, sunk 40 hours into it in two weeks, and haven't touched it until today.
7620188	7626770	Thanks to Steam constantly advertising the latest mods, I decided to give it another go, but only after spending two hours respeccing my character.
7627450	7631955	Being able to respec plus the sky UI has made the game playable again.
7632575	7636139	By the way, the HD graphics pack made the game look that much better.
7636600	7640984	Anywho, keep up the good work and I'll listen to your answer tomorrow, your loyal turtle in Philly, Serious Turtle.
7641604	7642984	I kind of want to play it on my PC.
7643625	7645485	So do I. I don't know if my PC can run it, though.
7645665	7646185	I think it can.
7646606	7648026	I'm sure mine can.
7648086	7649306	Games I'm looking forward to this year.
7650827	7652227	Kingdom Heart, Dream Drop Distance.
7652267	7652528	Yes!
7652728	7654648	Which is out in Japan, but it's not out here yet.
7656709	7658749	The new Tomb Raider looks really good still.
7659130	7659990	I'm interested in that.
7661050	7666434	I kind of think there's going to be stuff at E3 that we don't know about yet that will be very exciting, especially with the Wii U and everything.
7668095	7674499	Also, it's looking very, very, very good that I'm going to be able to go to E3 this year, so I'm very excited about that because I didn't go last year, really.
7674859	7675920	I sat in the lobby last year.
7677060	7679482	But hopefully this year I'll get to get some hands on that.
7679502	7680282	I miss E3.
7680302	7680382	I do.
7680462	7680923	It is fun.
7681423	7682704	I do miss it, but I can't.
7683393	7683953	You have a baby.
7684293	7685654	He has separation anxiety.
7685754	7687375	When the kid's 18, then he can go to E3.
7687395	7689656	Probably not that old.
7691116	7692417	But you can't take kids under 18.
7692877	7695558	You can take him.
7696739	7700781	By four, hopefully he'll understand that daddy goes away sometimes.
7701461	7706163	Yeah, he's just at the point now where it's just like, you know, he's very clingy.
7706724	7707664	Understand, understand.
7708115	7713002	I get to stay back at work and work while everybody goes and drives down to Monterey.
7713022	7713262	Rough life.
7723168	7724509	Who said I'm going to work though when they leave?
7724529	7726709	I'm kicking back.
7727790	7729211	Internet all day, every day.
7729431	7729971	So that's it.
7730551	7734833	Emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com if you want to send us some emails in the future.
7734873	7737054	Again, that's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
7737074	7737894	Good emails this week.
7737934	7738434	Thank you guys.
7738814	7739995	Let's get to the FUs of the week.
7740015	7740795	Making me work.
7741496	7742296	The FUs of the week.
7742436	7742876	Here we go.
7743116	7747098	And some special April Fool's FU music as picked by Loki tonight.
7753806	7757807	You know I tried to find the whole video for that song just because I needed to hear it in context.
7758207	7758688	It's awesome.
7759968	7760268	Anyway.
7761949	7764929	This is actually really well looped.
7766190	7768090	I'm just mesmerized for a second.
7768891	7769231	Anyway.
7769251	7772952	You need to stop that because that's too distracting.
7772972	7776293	How about if I get the sax guy off the screen?
7776892	7777332	DarkSakura.com
7794069	7797671	What sucks about it?
7797711	7797851	Bitch.
7822959	7826880	What sucks is that I have a class that's on during my work shift.
7827700	7831201	So I'm basically going to have to miss the rest of the semester of that class.
7831561	7835042	But I've already told the teacher that if I got a job, job comes first.
7835762	7836243	There you go.
7836843	7837123	Loki!
7837643	7841404	Fuck you, McDonald's, for not being able to make food correctly.
7841724	7842704	I mean, it's not that hard.
7842904	7843305	Seriously.
7843685	7844765	You're calling that food?
7845805	7852188	Well, it's Harley food, but like I said, there's a few McDonald's on the way here and no Burger Kings that are right on the way here.
7852448	7859071	So, it's like, well, I could drive way the fuck out of the way to go to Burger King or I could just be quick and get McDonald's.
7859131	7859871	So, I was quick.
7860411	7864193	I was actually almost going to get their Fish McBites that they have now.
7864713	7866174	Although, I think that would be poison.
7866274	7868454	So, I'm not really sure if I should do that.
7868835	7869175	I'm not.
7870798	7871578	That's it.
7871778	7874799	F you to the people that keep wanting to compare Battle Royale to Hunger Games.
7874919	7875480	Get over it.
7876140	7881041	And F you to F you to Jelly Belly.
7882122	7883302	I am so mad.
7883442	7885643	I am no longer going to be able to eat Jelly Bellies anymore.
7885703	7886123	What happened?
7886423	7887643	I'm boycotting Jelly Bellies.
7887703	7888163	What happened?
7888183	7900006	They had Rick Santorum at their factory giving a speech and then did this whole thousand dollar a plate fundraiser dinner at Jelly Belly because I never knew this.
7900026	7910889	They contribute to all these causes which I don't, you know, I'm not mad at, like I'm not the person to usually get up there and say F you to all Republicans and all this because I don't feel that way.
7910909	7911509	But he's evil.
7911529	7915130	There's a lot of Republicans I do like and there's some progressive ideas that
7915370	7915871	and DarkSakura.
7931812	7936413	He's the village idiot of this country and deserves to be pointed and laughed at wherever he goes.
7936773	7942555	And I'm just sad that he has tainted the Jelly Belly Factory and I can no longer support that company.
7942595	7943735	And I urge all of you to.
7944555	7950777	I was hoping that maybe it was all like they were going to do a Bernie's Bots for Santorum flavored jelly beans.
7951437	7951677	But...
7952077	7952557	and DarkSakura.
7972427	7972767	All right.
7974509	7978311	So moving on, let's talk a little bit about changes.
7978932	7982815	And Sega, unfortunately, changing for the worst.
7983175	7986858	They are canceling games, cutting jobs, and restructuring.
7987798	7991541	And, of course, their expected net income is down almost 50%.
7992141	7994603	And, of course, they're going to make some changes regarding that.
7994623	7999447	They're streamlining the operations of Sega, both in the United States and Europe.
8000368	8008560	Um, they're gonna focus on key franchises, including Sonic, Football Manager, Total War, and Aliens.
8010342	8011304	So, um...
8013243	8014264	Yeah, it's interesting.
8014444	8021410	Funny enough, though, they're actually still doing an Olympics game in June, so maybe they're restructuring after that.
8023551	8027755	Oh, no, that Sonic and Mario Olympic game did crazy good on the Wii.
8027835	8028796	No, I'm not talking about that.
8028956	8034380	I'm talking about the actual Olympic games, the sports game that's on PS3 and 360.
8035641	8037383	But maybe for that same reason they're doing that.
8037443	8040105	I mean, that'd be pretty cool.
8040345	8068091	but yeah I can understand they try a lot of experimental stuff and it doesn't always work out if only they'd release Shenmue 3 if only well I think they kind of do that stuff though a little bit more experimental stuff though on Xbox Live Arcade so I don't know necessarily we're going to see the end of that kind of stuff because after all they're going to be doing Jet Set Radio here so it's very possible that they'll still do Shenmue alright
8069417	8072259	DarkSakura, I know you've got to be feeling a little sad about the changes at Sega.
8095669	8098091	Yeah, I'm also pissed off at my laptop, but that's another thing.
8098251	8099432	Did Sega build your laptop?
8099752	8100733	No, it's a piece of shit.
8100953	8101473	Oh, I'm sorry.
8102834	8104896	Nietzsche in our chatroom is wondering the same thing.
8105296	8109279	What's going to happen to my PlayStation Online 2 Sega?
8109359	8111240	What about PSO2, you bastards?
8111520	8112381	That's how I feel.
8115503	8115864	We'll see.
8115964	8118946	Just stop putting out the crappy Sonic games and maybe it'll be better.
8121923	8122824	Firefly the Arcade Game
8149803	8150183	April Fools' Joke
8158163	8159464	What time does it say?
8159544	8160164	It doesn't say.
8160184	8161425	It just says March 31st, 2012.
8162146	8164247	So I'm going to take it with a grain of salt.
8164267	8165648	This probably is a joke.
8166028	8169170	But let's entertain the idea that it's real for a minute.
8169230	8171712	Let's entertain if it could be realistic or not.
8172973	8180918	Apparently, because of the 10th anniversary of the show Firefly, even though it had a short life on television, it's very cult.
8181218	8184361	And now they're talking about a Firefly arcade game.
8184701	8187943	See, the thing about this is the screenshot does look really fake to me.
8189778	8190859	The whole thing looks very fake.
8190879	8191219	It does.
8191299	8193940	It's a whole first-person shooter and all this.
8194100	8196921	Yeah, and that cabinet, too, just doesn't look... No.
8197682	8200763	Let's assume it could be real, though.
8201884	8203305	Somebody was really thinking about this.
8203345	8205065	Would this be something worth doing?
8205866	8208247	Because it is a bit of a cultish franchise, but I...
8209148	8225147	a lot of stuff from kind of back of the day ends up coming full circle again I don't even know necessarily it's an arcade game but like a pinball game I could totally see a Firefly pinball game I really don't think it would happen I mean then again I'm sure Joss would like the money
8225367	8241581	they wouldn't make an arcade game based on a property that's niche like that especially since arcade games nowadays it's just like you've got to have some sort of gimmick to get people to come to the arcades to play the game they're not going to spend the money to make cabinets for an arcade game like that
8243200	8244681	April Fools, haha April Fools, haha
8274269	8274929	All right, moving on.
8276970	8278331	Oh, yeah, that would be me, wouldn't it?
8279251	8279672	Yes, ma'am.
8279932	8280552	How about Tesco?
8280592	8281452	Do you know what Tesco is?
8282593	8284754	They are a big grocery store in Britain, right?
8284974	8287675	Yes, did you know that they've opened markets in the United States?
8287775	8289076	Yes, because they're fresh and easy.
8289116	8289876	That's how I knew that.
8290036	8290196	Yep.
8290377	8293158	And they're being protested, hella, the new stores that open here.
8293478	8293598	Really?
8293618	8295419	Because I guess Tesco is very anti-union.
8295979	8298800	So some of the union grocers in the area are protesting.
8299001	8301082	When I drove by, there was actually an ambulance in front of it.
8302202	8304184	Maybe they started fighting each other, who knows?
8304224	8304625	Maybe.
8304885	8305185	Maybe.
8305265	8311872	Well, at any rate, the supermarket has now said they are the home of gaming in the advertisement over in the UK.
8312012	8314935	Well, I guess since Game UK went under, there's an opening.
8315556	8317998	Actually, there's no more game store closures.
8318579	8318939	Oh, really?
8319260	8321742	Yeah, there was an article on that on Eurogamer.
8321802	8323504	Oh, I didn't hear that follow-up.
8323884	8324965	They didn't close any more stores.
8325146	8325346	Huh.
8326187	8345844	so basically they're saying that they have more gaming stores in the UK than any other retailers so that's 393 open at midnight for new releases and that they will have over 10,000 titles available online free UK delivery and day one pre-order shipping
8347347	8348848	So I have no idea what to say about that.
8349388	8354350	This reminds me of when 7-Eleven got into gaming for a hot minute.
8355271	8357512	They stopped doing that, right?
8358873	8361454	Dan is friends with somebody who managed.
8362014	8363935	That was a big flop.
8364275	8365556	Well, of course it was a big flop.
8366545	8367306	What about this though?
8367406	8374475	I mean, I remember back in the day, a lot of grocery stores had like video rental shops in it.
8375136	8376979	And you could also rent games there too.
8377079	8381184	So like integrating, and a lot of them still sell DVDs.
8381384	8383307	It's not a bad idea considering that
8384067	8395973	The video rental market is coming back because blockbusters have closed down, Hollywood has closed down, most of your mom and pop shops have closed down.
8396073	8400275	Now they're starting to reopen back up, although kiosks are popular nowadays.
8401669	8412681	Well, I found the thing about game, by the way, that it was OpCapita, that's a parent company of Comet, is bidding for game again.
8413522	8416546	And there's 333 stores still open, 211 of them being game and 122 being game station.
8421631	8432643	and basically they were initially blocked by the lending syndicate that owned them including the Royal Bank of Scotland.
8434700	8435721	That was what stopped them before.
8436501	8439143	So could video games at the grocery store work?
8439744	8444747	I think especially the cheaper market could work because you see a lot of that at Target.
8445247	8452812	I mean, yes, Target sells new games and all that too, but they also like up by the registers usually have the $20 Wii games and those seem to do all right.
8452892	8455614	Like they sell more there than they probably would at a GameStop or something.
8455634	8463099	Well, Tesco's pretty big too and I think they are like a wide, very broad in their services and markets, so...
8463619	8463839	Sure.
8464019	8465180	Probably like a Safeway here.
8465380	8466340	You know, it's got a lot of stuff.
8466380	8471222	It's not necessarily just the store, but usually the full-service deli in China, you know, a lot of places.
8472563	8472843	I'm sorry.
8473143	8473363	Go ahead.
8473823	8477165	Well, as far as I understand it, it actually is a bit more like a Super Target.
8478005	8478465	Oh, okay.
8478745	8478965	You know.
8478985	8479546	So Tesco is really big.
8479566	8486949	I mean, but it was a big supermarket, but like you can get, or maybe like a, oh, what's that thing that they had in Washington that Fred Meyer.
8486969	8487289	Fred Meyer.
8487509	8487809	Yeah.
8488809	8489710	The sum of everything.
8489810	8490050	Okay.
8490070	8490150	Yeah.
8491843	8495382	Alright, well, Loki, if you don't have any comments, then let's go to the next story
8497681	8502984	Let's talk about something, kind of a really cool piece of technology, BrowserQuest.
8503104	8507167	It was an MMO tech demo built by Mozilla.
8507887	8512390	And it's basically an MMO that works in browsers.
8512970	8519274	And they've got this little, kind of almost looks like a 16-bit MMO that you can play.
8519954	8524917	And it actually will kind of work in any browser, I guess, that supports HTML5.
8526739	8542351	and they even have the full source available on github if you want to create your own MMO based off that which is pretty cool and if you want to check it out you can go to mozilla.org future of MMOs
8550222	8550722	Possibly?
8551763	8555066	Sounds like just another, like, oh, yay, free, MM, you know, type of thing.
8555646	8558568	Yeah, I mean... I mean, how many browser-based games do we have these days?
8558728	8559209	There's a lot.
8559609	8567975	Yeah, but the Ultima one that EA had... But, I mean, something that runs in HTML5, though, that would be compatible with, you know, like, iOS and stuff like that.
8568316	8569777	Oh, I get where you're going with that, then.
8570037	8570257	Okay.
8570297	8578403	So, like, on mobile devices and stuff, it's not just... Or, like, All Games Radio is compatible with HTML5, and you can get it on your iDevice at allgames.com.
8578584	8578724	Yeah.
8579384	8590093	Yeah, so they're saying, yeah, it's written in HTML5 and JavaScript and can be played in Firefox, Chrome, Safari, with WebSockets enabled, also in Opera.
8590934	8593636	And they're saying, of course, iOS devices and stuff like that.
8595237	8600762	If you want to play the game, it's browserquest.mozilla.org is the URL to go in.
8602216	8603637	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8626378	8629919	But there's also Zork Grand Inquisitor, Zork Nemesis, all these games came out.
8629939	8634861	And then of course the text adventure games, Zork Anthology, Zork 1 through 3, Beyond Zork, Zork 0.
8635701	8640043	All of these games are on sale right now at the website Good Old Games.
8640103	8646725	They're half off right now along with some other games such as Caesar 3, Vampire the Masquerade, Redemption, and so forth.
8647185	8649986	So yeah, pretty cool if you're a Zork fan.
8651106	8653987	Oh God, I remember the Commodore 64 text adventure really well.
8654247	8656128	That's when games were hard.
8656248	8658289	You had to know exactly what to type into that game.
8661350	8663030	Don't run out of matches or torches.
8663431	8663831	Exactly.
8663871	8664931	You might get eaten by a Groo.
8665651	8672714	So if you want to get your Groos half off, get your Groove on at GOG.com.
8674281	8680683	That's a much better April Fool's thing than what they did a few years ago with the whole we're going to shut down unless you give... I don't remember what it was.
8680703	8681403	It was really terrible.
8681943	8682143	All right.
8682163	8684324	Anyhow, let's get into some Twitter topics.
8684744	8689065	And we're going to open the Skype line right now because it's not open yet.
8689265	8690165	And I should do that.
8690185	8691845	1-877-GAME-OLR.
8692406	8696046	Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
8697607	8700568	And Skype is signing into the wrong account right now.
8700628	8702028	That's really convenient, isn't it?
8705000	8707262	You can call and talk about whatever.
8707282	8713407	If you want to take it back to the Bimani stuff, that's fine too since that was part of our fun tonight.
8713427	8718911	1-877-GAME-OLR or again our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8719051	8719631	All one word.
8720592	8728797	While we wait for some calls, let's go to our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR and see what tweets are in store for us.
8729998	8734460	Gamer Girl tweets us saying, Is PlayStation Plus really worth the money?
8735021	8737883	I was thinking about getting a subscription, but I want to know if it's worth the money.
8739143	8768264	I think I'm the only one that actually has PlayStation Plus here I'll tell you this if you use your PlayStation a lot and especially if you buy from the store a lot then yes there's you know so many discounts and things and a lot of freebies that you get with PlayStation as well so if you think you'd kind of be into some of those freebies you want to get like one arcade game every couple weeks or so I think it's a pretty good deal and getting Journey early was really nice as well so I think there's a lot of good stuff there but um
8769662	8771582	It really depends on how much you love your PlayStation.
8772323	8774063	Meanwhile, the phones are ringing, so let's go to the phones.
8774103	8775083	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
8775103	8775463	Who's this?
8776884	8778744	Hi, this is DS Lover.
8779324	8780505	Hey, what's your name again?
8781905	8782705	DS Lover.
8782865	8783665	DS Lover.
8783705	8784405	What's on your mind?
8785986	8792447	Not much other than to talk about something that happened last night on the Cartoon Network.
8792467	8795408	I don't know if the rest of you...
8796016	8802642	and the rest of the anime community ever caught this, but Toonami was on instead of the usual Adult Swim bumpers.
8802662	8803663	And hopefully this
8820819	8825122	And I'm not just saying this, but you know how I sent you guys an email?
8825182	8829184	Yeah, how you guys have risen above a podcast that just pretty much kicked us?
8829764	8833407	Well, I'm going to reveal that podcast name right here now.
8834087	8837949	Games and More Entertainment Radio, like, they've just pretty much ceased.
8838530	8845554	They're not doing anything anymore, and just, like, I need my gaming news fix on a weekly basis, or else I'm still left.
8847116	8852120	Well, is that another indie show, or is that a corporate-backed show?
8853441	8855142	No, it's another indie show.
8855302	8872894	Well, I don't like to throw shade at the other indie shows, because they all work hard at what they do, but everybody's got different preferences, so... Yeah, and I will say here, with the fact that 16th Empress beat Minya with the last one, the PS2...
8874011	8878294	Has anyone heard any announcements for the PlayStation 3 versions at all?
8878574	8878854	Nope.
8878894	8895485	We kind of think that Konami may have just given up on the whole damn series, which is a darn shame because I think there's opportunity there for them to do a massive collection on the PlayStation 3, but that would require them investing in another controller or at least a converter for the old ones, which I would think would be easy to do, but they don't want to do it.
8895606	8899688	There are controller converters for the PlayStation 2 controllers.
8899728	8902090	I mean, they already work for the Guitar Hero stuff.
8902867	8904747	I mean, it shouldn't be that hard.
8904767	8909269	I think they should be able to work on the Beatmania controllers.
8909389	8914630	If anyone in the crowd would like to test that out, I'd be willing to import.
8914830	8922852	There could be lag, I don't know, especially with the music game, lag could kill it, but I mean, if they did it with the guitars and so forth, then I don't see why it isn't possible, but...
8923172	8924673	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8950232	8950612	I don't know.
8950992	8956815	They've got to see that the fans are there for 2DX to sell on the PlayStation 3, and then maybe they'll do it.
8957175	8960537	But certainly in America, Beatmania didn't sell.
8962217	8971882	Yeah, and I think it was because the set list was halfway the problem, and that's what I've heard from many Pumani fans, was the set list was one of the few problems on top of
8972857	8975999	Oh, it's way too easy to get your place in this.
8993607	8997048	Yeah, which is why I'm currently on the search for something like BM98 for the Macintosh or some of the equivalent, because
9023789	9032856	I'm thinking about getting one of those Joy-Cue keys or one of those PS2 to USB adapters for my computer just so I can play Beatmania.
9033056	9036178	Or even a similar... You know what you need to do?
9036639	9039000	You need to write a letter to Konami.
9039020	9041302	You need to say, I am a concerned fan.
9041522	9043984	And that's once Konami hears voices.
9044044	9046646	But anything is possible at E3.
9046826	9050289	I mean, wouldn't it be cool if maybe the Wii U could become a controller somehow?
9050309	9050389	Yeah.
9051707	9053428	Hey, what about Twitter?
9053728	9055328	I'm sure it's well, they have a Twitter.
9056089	9057329	Tweet them!
9057349	9062431	The body fans of the world, tweet Konami to bring Beatman to the PS3.
9063031	9064992	It worked with President Kat, sort of.
9065112	9072775	Alright, well, DS, what was, DS fan, I gotta let you go and take more calls, but thanks for the call.
9074261	9076202	Yeah, peace out and keep the shows rockin'.
9101971	9103653	1-877-GAME-OLR.
9103753	9105796	Username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9106817	9108580	Going to some Tweety Tweets here.
9109160	9114688	Dartetsuya says, coming to the site this week, I've got something planned for the listeners to participate in.
9115108	9116490	So stay tuned.
9117051	9118573	That doesn't sound like an April Fool's joke.
9119714	9120915	Stay tuned.
9121996	9122497	Moving on.
9122977	9128722	SSJ100Matt tweets us, I know it's a video game show, but I played Cards Against Humanity, the card game.
9129043	9130844	It's apples to apples, but M-rated.
9131104	9132966	Well, you've never heard of this now, Loki, have you?
9133006	9134207	Of course not.
9134688	9137050	So you're very familiar with Cards Against Humanity, right?
9137370	9137630	Yes.
9138011	9141234	Cards Against Humanity is a very inappropriate apples to apples game.
9141814	9142775	What makes it so great?
9142835	9144396	Just its level of inappropriateness?
9144517	9144737	Yes.
9146954	9147234	All right.
9148355	9152158	Going to WatchDragon, who tweets us, Mr. Pandaria is great.
9152598	9154079	Just finished the starting area.
9154440	9158803	How did you get past all of those freaking pandas and some of those quests?
9158823	9160264	That must have taken a lot of patience.
9160885	9162146	Some of the art style is neat, though.
9162366	9163967	I do like the way Pandaria looks.
9164047	9164567	It's cute.
9164868	9167750	If you want to see it later, DarkSakura, we can fire it up on the computer before you go.
9168150	9168690	If you want to peek.
9168951	9169151	Sure.
9169871	9170272	Be fun.
9171272	9171573	All right.
9172233	9174115	Going to some tweets from Tigerclaw.
9175911	9178333	1877 GameOLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9178833	9184316	Tigerclaw says, why Soul Calibur V only had one-fourth of a full story mode?
9184816	9188298	I did feel like story mode in Soul Calibur V seemed to be lacking a little bit.
9189238	9191019	But what happened with Soul Calibur V?
9191359	9202445	Apparently it's an interview that was on Train to Game with the producer Daishi Odashima says the story mode shipped with the game was a fourth of what they had planned.
9202825	9214270	Quote, our first plan on the storyboard was that we add every character's story, and actually we do have it in the studio, but time-wise, manpower-wise, we weren't able to do it, and only one-fourth of what we planned to do is in the game.
9214610	9216371	That was a dumb thing for them to admit.
9216551	9219532	We could do it if only we had the DLC.
9219552	9220492	Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.
9220552	9222493	I just think that was a dumb thing for them to say.
9222913	9226575	I think they should have kept those cards closer to their chest, sorry to say.
9228837	9234323	But it did feel to me that story mode in Soul Calibur 5 was a little bit lacking.
9235264	9237687	So, Tigerclaw sends us another tweet.
9237847	9240230	Warhammer 40k Dark Millennium.
9240770	9244495	It's going single player because layoffs have hit Relic and Vigil.
9244995	9246836	More layoffs, man, this is a bummer.
9248037	9251720	So Warhammer 40K Dark Millennium, it's now a single-player action game.
9251740	9253521	It will have multiplayer elements.
9254101	9263047	The president and CEO of THQ, Brian Farrell, put out a press release saying, quote, as previously announced, we have been actively looking for a business partner for the game as MMO.
9263427	9274615	However, based on changing market dynamics and the additional investment required to complete the game as an MMO, we believe the right direction for us is to shift the title from an MMO to a premium experience with single and multiplayer gameplay.
9275136	9282074	Robust digital content and community features So, shit tons of DLC, y'all Actually
9283527	9287648	As much as it sucks that these studios got closed and so forth, this makes sense.
9288108	9292929	I think the MMO market is really volatile right now, and it's really tough to make a showing.
9293290	9295770	I mean, look at where Star Wars is at.
9295930	9302012	They've come the second best probably to getting wow, and even they're starting to lose some people who are getting kind of bored of the game.
9302612	9304732	So MMOs are hard to do.
9306033	9307413	Phone calls are a lot easier to do.
9307473	9308713	We have a phone call coming in now.
9308774	9309834	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9309854	9310194	Who's this?
9311257	9312077	Hey, it's Porkchop.
9312297	9313838	Porkchop, what's on your mind, buddy?
9313918	9314238	Hello.
9315238	9320000	Well, it's good that you started talking about the whole Soul Calibur thing because I was really let down by that.
9320040	9321900	That pissed me off, something serious.
9322320	9323300	Porkchop, where are you from?
9324261	9325321	I'm on Ireland, actually.
9325521	9326441	I could tell.
9327182	9327602	Hello.
9328222	9328582	Love it.
9328902	9331783	You guys stay up late to listen to the show over there.
9332123	9333623	Well, I do.
9333964	9337044	Wasn't that a dumb thing for them to say, that they only finished a quarter of it?
9339736	9368628	I was so pissed off I mean I remember playing through the story mode okay and it was it took me a day I played it in one fucking day and I played that I paid like it'd be about what 40 or 50 euros something like that'd be about 50 60 dollars something like that in the exchange I went and played that it took me like two maybe not even an hour I played it and I said fuck this I'm really disappointed so what I did was I brought it back I got Arkham City and I was much happier
9369813	9374474	Thank God the creative character mode's at least still fun, and the fighting core game is still really fun.
9374494	9377455	But yeah, the story mode was a little bit disappointing there, so.
9377775	9380776	Oh Christ, I mean, if you finish it in an hour, it's not worth buying.
9380816	9382076	For that price, I mean, come on.
9382096	9385057	I mean, I don't even buy full-price games anymore, never mind anything.
9385577	9389518	Like, nowadays I just look in GameStop for games that are like two to three years old.
9390018	9392818	Like, I just picked up Final Fantasy XIII for, what, six?
9393339	9393939	Six euros?
9394199	9395079	Oh God, it was cheap.
9398103	9403727	I've been waiting 10 years for an angry Irishman rant on this show and it had to happen on April Fool's Day.
9403767	9406129	You should really see the look on Rob's face right now.
9406189	9408730	He just looks like he's won the lottery.
9409531	9409851	Yeah.
9410372	9413834	Well, I'm glad I can fulfill your fantasy or whatever the hell is going on.
9414795	9416316	That was Rob's final fantasy.
9418457	9419358	So there you go.
9420639	9423340	I mean, full price games nowadays really aren't worth it.
9423520	9424561	That's the fact of the matter.
9424621	9425462	I wait like for...
9426494	9426975	and so on.
9441776	9442837	Oh God, why not?
9442877	9445359	I mean, I'm never going to pay full price for a game again.
9445379	9447540	That's pretty much how I'm looking at it at this stage.
9447560	9457367	Well, Porkchop, let me ask you this then, and maybe I'm baiting you for another rant here, but it certainly begs worth asking when you kind of are sick of only buying these new games that are so expensive and so forth.
9457727	9468034	How do you feel about this story we were talking about earlier that by the time the PlayStation 4 and whatever's next on Xbox are out, or Orbis or whatever it's called, that used games aren't going to happen.
9468214	9469355	They're going to block used games.
9469375	9469695	Yeah.
9470322	9471964	Pain in the fucking ass.
9472064	9477632	I mean, as I said, I said in chat that I always favorite hard copies over digital anyway.
9477672	9481177	I mean, I still buy CDs and I'm never going to use iTunes or any of that shit.
9481821	9483282	I'm still doing that to this day.
9483342	9485222	It's like CDs are my vinyl in a way.
9485703	9490104	So I'm just going to keep doing that and pray to fuck that Sony kind of cop out.
9490124	9491745	I mean, Steam's really successful.
9492045	9496366	I kind of favor those guys because they aren't kind of overcharging the fans or anything.
9496667	9504209	Me and my best friend, he kind of works in the industry and he was telling me Steam are basically the daddy at this stage and they look to be like some sort of messiah.
9504770	9510912	So it's looking good on their end, but Sony are overcharging people way too fucking much as far as I'm concerned.
9511252	9522738	Yeah, you know, and what's funny, what you made me think about while you were talking about Steam and the way that they're viewed in the industry, there was a rumor a couple weeks ago or maybe even last week on this show about the whole Steam box.
9523239	9540068	And although Valve was quick to shoot that down that that's not actually happening, you can't help but think, holy shit, what if you have the PlayStation Orbis, which doesn't play used games, and you have the Xbox 360 or, excuse me, 720 or Lube or whatever it's called that doesn't play used games, and then you have the Steam box...
9540748	9542529	All of the receipts he had for the past...
9561468	9588021	a couple of months and I looked at it and I compared PlayStation Store and I was like what the fuck am I doing with a PS3 if I can get all these games all the same games nearly every single title I have he had a receipt for and it was like oh god the sales that were on he picked up like 50 games within the space of 3 months and he totted it up and he showed me the end total which would have been if they weren't on sale was around 400
9589642	9590543	and I was like, wow.
9590963	9593305	And he actually said, I never paid that much for it.
9593365	9595567	And I was like, holy shit, I want a Steam account.
9596087	9597288	And that was me saying.
9597348	9598789	Could that be a regional thing though?
9598809	9604353	Because most of it here in the US, it seems like, especially when new games come out, it's about the same.
9604413	9608737	You'd play on the PlayStation Network that you would on Steam or whatever, getting it on PC.
9609077	9616663	Part of me wonders if PlayStation doesn't jack up the price even more overseas in other countries and maybe it's that price
9616903	9625253	That pain of the, whatever you want to call it, translation of the cost or whatever is truly causing the difference.
9626194	9628257	The truth is, it wouldn't surprise me.
9628277	9631140	I mean, even he said games in America are way cheaper.
9631601	9633964	I mean, as far as I know, I think they are anyway.
9634204	9635565	Yeah, it's true.
9635785	9638347	I hate to sound like I'm bragging, but it's true.
9638888	9651258	When we see how much you guys pay in euros or whatever currency we're looking at over there, it's pretty crazy how much you guys are paying for stuff over there than we are here.
9651318	9652519	I think we're paying on average 10-15% less.
9654167	9654907	Oh, I'm sure.
9655187	9657869	I mean, when you look at the exchange rate, you can see that.
9657889	9675576	But even the prices, I'm sure, like, you know, in terms of, you know, denominations of notes or money with bills, as you call them, you know, I'm sure you could pay, use two 20s to buy a good handful of games, whereas that wouldn't even get you, well, it gets you close to one, which is fucking ridiculous.
9675616	9681859	I mean, Ireland, apparently, the capital of Ireland, Dublin, is one of the most expensive cities in Europe at this stage.
9682906	9709507	so it's fucking ridiculous and that's why I have to go wait a couple of years for these games to come out and I have to go look and I'll be like okay I'm two or three I just finished Deus Ex and that's like year two years I finished Assassin's Creed a couple of days ago or a couple of months ago pardon me and you know I'm playing catch up at this stage but you know what I don't care I'm not paying full price it's fucking ridiculous as long as you've got fun stuff to play now anyway
9710461	9711161	That's it.
9711221	9720967	I mean, I have a good collection as it is, and I've kept some of the really old ones and hope to play through and buy the rest of the sequels in the next five years, something like that.
9720987	9725490	You could spend your entire life playing classic games and be totally satisfied.
9725530	9728351	I mean, look at the Classic Game of the Week segment we do here on OLR.
9728692	9734475	Yeah, I was actually pleased you actually brought up Street Fighter because I'm a big fan, and I got the Capcom Classics collection.
9734795	9735996	I played the shit out of that.
9736056	9737417	So, yeah, thanks for bringing that up.
9737657	9737957	No problem.
9738117	9739098	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9760672	9761713	and that's not even all of it.
9761873	9762834	Brag, brag, brag.
9763295	9766117	I'm just saying, I mean, it's one thing.
9766317	9772103	Have you actually got through most of them or are you waiting to play through them and kind of use one as game of the week at some stage?
9772897	9774218	We've actually gone through most of them.
9774298	9779643	I mean, a lot of the games that my husband and I picked up are games that we played when we were younger.
9779683	9782045	He was a big Sega guy, and I was a big Nintendo girl.
9783026	9788030	So when we got together, we both had the love of our systems and brought them together.
9788771	9798419	So we go back, and now, though, we have staples that we play, but we'll pick up something every so often just because we've just had the biggest boner to play it.
9799159	9807225	Yeah, I went on a mad buzz about maybe two, three years ago and I decided, fuck this, I have a Dreamcast, I'm going to buy games for it.
9807625	9811748	I got Jet Set Radio and Shenmue and I was like, okay, I don't regret this one.
9811768	9815051	I mean, I thought it was going to be like, oh God, these games, why did I buy these?
9815131	9817172	But I actually enjoyed them and I love playing.
9817212	9824297	I play them again and again and again every time I visit my mum's house where she keeps my old room and I have all the Dreamcast games.
9824317	9826059	I still have some PS2 games in there, so...
9826872	9832354	It's like a little fucking hermit's cave where I go back and just play games for the weekend or whatever.
9832554	9835755	I've been tempted to hook up the Dreamcast because I actually want to finish Grandia 2.
9835855	9840097	Wow, that's an old... That's a fun RPG.
9841277	9848380	Well, Porkchop, I have absolutely loved having you on the show because I love accents, so I appreciate you calling in.
9848760	9852261	But it's going over a little bit, so I've got to wrap up to get some more calls.
9852721	9854162	Do you quickly have any other final thoughts?
9855559	9857742	Just basically, I love the station.
9857762	9858403	I love all games.
9858463	9860345	I love Orange Lounge, Dead Picks, all that.
9860385	9863509	Keep up the good work, and I'll be listening through the early hours all the time.
9863749	9866833	We love you, and if Derek's listening, I know he's going to appreciate that shout-out.
9868355	9868675	Cool.
9868836	9869116	All right.
9869176	9869697	Take care, buddy.
9870598	9871038	Thanks, guys.
9871078	9871439	All the best.
9871639	9871879	All right.
9871919	9872240	Take care.
9873462	9873782	Love it.
9874102	9875983	The International Orange Lounge Radio.
9876003	9884187	And I'm even being asked in our chat room, I think I'm saying this name right, Delighter in our chat room says, Rob is very fond of the Irish, I take it.
9885088	9887449	I get mistaken as Irish all the time.
9887489	9887969	I can't even tell you.
9887989	9888850	Because of that red hair.
9889010	9892992	Well, look at that little get up I wore to Umlaut with the hat and everything.
9893492	9895493	I did look kind of Irish, even I'll admit that.
9895973	9898795	I am actually, by heritage, I am half Scottish.
9899395	9900516	So I look very Scottish.
9900756	9902477	That means that you greet people by headbutting them.
9902937	9909861	My real name is Dutch, so I have a little more in common with Syl from Girls Gone Wild than I do with that color.
9909921	9912543	I married a Dutch ancestry.
9912723	9913343	You did.
9913503	9916665	Your husband has a very Dutch... It's funny that... You have a Dutch name now, too.
9916705	9920347	I have a Dutch name, but none of my blood kin are remotely Dutch.
9920688	9922789	All right, we got another call on the line, so let's go to it.
9922829	9923830	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9923850	9924190	Who's this?
9925680	9926161	Nobuo Amatsu
9935040	9939562	A couple nights ago... Wait, wait, now, we don't need to hear about your romantic adventures.
9939602	9940603	No, no, no, no, no.
9940643	9943504	No, that's actually the name... Well, that was the name of the little concert that he had.
9943524	9944965	That's kind of dirty.
9944985	9945906	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
9946406	9946866	Shut up.
9947326	9949588	Hey, don't tell me to shut up.
9949648	9950288	It's my show.
9950408	9950708	All right.
9951309	9951889	Yeah, okay.
9952809	9956671	No, but it was just this really small concert where it was just 150 people.
9957372	9963575	It was Nobuo Matsu and Arnie Roth, who's this conductor in Chicago, and they had this string quartet playing...
9964504	9988456	Dark World from Final Fantasy 6 and this new string quartet arrangement of Fight with Seymour from Final Fantasy 10 and it sounded really good and I was really excited about it so of course I had my phone on me and I tried sneaking my camera on and I recorded the whole concert and I tried putting it on YouTube actually that sounds awesome but you know what
9989709	9990410	No, it was worth it.
9990450	9991331	I'm sorry.
9991351	9997496	The piracy, the jail time is going to be worth it because it was so good.
9997877	10002941	When the songs were done, I turned around to see people climbing and stuff.
10002961	10004823	People had their camera right in front of their face.
10005143	10006884	They were being very obvious about us.
10006904	10007524	I was like, whatever.
10007644	10008445	I don't feel bad anymore.
10008465	10011986	I was going to say, an intimate evening in Cell Block 5 with Stan.
10015448	10016189	Here's the thing, though.
10017109	10023692	How did you get into this concert if it's only 150 people?
10023712	10024093	What?
10024513	10029955	I don't remember where it was being advertised, but a friend of mine posted this link on Facebook, and I saw it.
10030296	10032177	It said, intimate evening with Novo Matsun.
10032197	10032957	I read the description.
10033561	10034722	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10065194	10070381	Yes, I got my 3DS signed by Noble and Arnie.
10070401	10071322	It's really cool.
10071703	10073345	Yes, hold on, wait.
10078723	10079964	I asked Arnie Roth
10110186	10125671	If he would ever consider having an amateur musician sit-down session reading the actual orchestral music, being able to experience the orchestra feel by being inside it, by paying like a small fee, and he was actually really interested in the idea.
10125691	10135895	Well, that's what he told me, but it sounded really cool because I really wanted to play, you know, Final Fantasy music in an orchestral setting with Arnie Roth and Nobu playing, or
10136848	10139249	I figured that'd be really, really cool.
10139569	10141910	That sounds like a heck of an experience.
10141970	10144671	And there's obviously lots of band nerds who are video game nerds.
10144711	10146991	And I say that endearingly because I was a band nerd in high school.
10147291	10154133	There's lots of band nerds and video game nerds that are kind of into both those worlds that I think would just get the ultimate kick out of that.
10154393	10156794	But now I'm going to have to ask you, what do you play in the orchestra?
10158375	10159755	Oh, actually nothing.
10159815	10161155	I play saxophone.
10161996	10163476	So I wouldn't even be able to do this.
10163656	10164677	So does Dark Sakura.
10164717	10165517	Dark Sakura is a saxophone.
10165537	10166037	I'd probably have to...
10167216	10171939	DarkSakura is a sax person too.
10171979	10172540	Here's the thing though.
10172740	10180925	Even if you couldn't play the Final Fantasy music as part of the jam, what you could do is when the time's right, you could just be there in the back and you can just bust out with this.
10182446	10184187	There you go.
10184327	10185688	Be the epic sax guy.
10192379	10194221	Sweet, I'm the beatbox guy.
10196162	10196422	All right.
10196862	10200205	Stan, I'm going to have to let you go because the connection's a little bit shit, but that's not your fault.
10200225	10200685	Don't worry about it.
10201246	10202647	Thank you for sharing your experience.
10203427	10206669	Please share the pictures online on Twitters or something so we can see them.
10208010	10208531	Yeah, you know what?
10208551	10211473	I'll send you a link on Facebook or something because that's the only place I have it right now.
10211633	10213034	And I would like to see the bootlegs.
10213234	10214415	I would like to see the bootlegs very much.
10215536	10215836	13 minutes.
10216116	10216777	It's long.
10216977	10217777	That's all right.
10218338	10218938	Okay, cool.
10219018	10219319	All right.
10219819	10220740	All right, send it on over.
10221080	10221300	Take it.
10222475	10223035	Take care.
10223175	10223916	I think we're breaking up.
10223976	10224436	Have a good one.
10224596	10224956	Good night.
10225617	10226217	Thank you, too.
10226237	10226637	Bye.
10226737	10227038	Bye.
10228118	10228378	All right.
10228398	10230900	Bummer about the connection, but hey, it happens.
10231120	10231680	What can you do?
10232241	10232561	All right.
10233101	10234622	Let's see if I can wrap up these Twitter topics.
10234662	10236143	I'm going to go ahead and close Skype for the night.
10236183	10237404	Thank you guys so much for calling in.
10237444	10238124	I really appreciate it.
10238504	10241946	Sorry to those that didn't get through, but try again next week.
10242046	10243567	Or, of course, you can always send us an email.
10244088	10247069	Again, that's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com.
10249698	10251180	Oh shit, I was actually out of tweets.
10251200	10252201	I guess I can do one more.
10252261	10254603	I'll let Tigerclaw have one more because this is pretty good.
10255523	10258226	So we'll do this other link from Tigerclaw here who sent us a link.
10258626	10263570	Retired NFL players are getting the green light for a lawsuit against EA.
10264693	10269615	Maybe you didn't hear, but retired NFL players actually filed a lawsuit against EA.
10270295	10275798	A California judge rejected EA's case to have the whole thing dismissed.
10276838	10279739	They want to turn this into a class action lawsuit, so $6,000.
10282481	10294516	The alleged lawsuit here is that EA through EA Sports brand used the likenesses without consent in multiple Madden NFL games over the years.
10295056	10300002	EA says it was basically fair use and real names were never used.
10300583	10302124	Hmm.
10302284	10303365	EA is mad in games, though.
10303385	10307928	They have a lot of historic teams that use stats, attributes, and other factors for fantasy players.
10308309	10312972	They're close to the real-life counterparts, but not exact.
10314053	10315114	Or so EA claims.
10315794	10321018	So I don't play these games, so it's hard for me to take an opinion on this one way or the other.
10321478	10326922	But the judge certainly felt they had a case, so it could be very interesting to see how this plays out.
10326942	10328163	Hmm.
10328283	10329943	That's it for our tweets tonight.
10329983	10332504	Twitter.com slash OLR.
10333004	10336005	But that also brings us to the end of the show.
10337065	10340246	But not before I ask for any last-minute stories from Loki or DarkSakura.
10340606	10340926	I'm good.
10341486	10341766	Meh.
10342106	10342447	All right.
10342987	10344087	Well, shit, we're done then.
10344107	10344547	We're out.
10344607	10348408	Let's do a last-minute... Let me do my last-minute kind of plea here.
10348848	10353029	We are, of course, a free show, and we do this every week for nothing.
10353069	10354329	We don't charge you guys.
10354369	10356390	We don't have ads in the show or ads on our website.
10356870	10360694	All we ask is that you tell a friend or two or 50 about the show.
10361154	10374546	Help us spread the word by leaving a nice review on a website such as iTunes or wherever you found this podcast or help tell people and spread the word about OLR because you'll help our little OLR army grow and we really appreciate it.
10375966	10378228	Let's go around and get everybody's final thought tonight.
10378428	10379468	Loki, why don't you start us off?
10379688	10390613	I think it's ironic that Volition or THQ or Saints Row's April Fool's show was for a new thing, a DLC that actually sounded cooler than the DLC that they put out.
10392654	10393595	Haha.
10393635	10394255	Joke's on you.
10394335	10395276	Your DLC sucked.
10395616	10397116	And I didn't buy the last two bits of it.
10397256	10398877	Also, read Ready Player One.
10399818	10401358	You can do it.
10401538	10402399	You won't be able to put it down.
10403694	10424581	my final thought for tonight is I'm excited that it's taco night because it's sure to be better than that shit taco I had at Chevy's on Monday just saying that was a pretty who puts fucking mayonnaise on a taco what right it was cilantro mayonnaise is gross hated it DarkSakura how about your final thought
10425678	10434764	Um, I really have to give, uh, the, uh, April Fool's award to, uh, Google for Google Quest.
10434924	10437045	Yeah, we didn't even bring that up tonight, but that was amazing.
10437326	10437886	That was great.
10438286	10441288	And I love the little commercial blowing in the cartridge and everything.
10441468	10449814	I loved the Easter eggs of like the little landmarks being, and there's a whole list on Reddit of like all the different hidden landmarks.
10449934	10450854	It's great.
10451395	10451835	I loved it.
10451875	10453936	They used all the Dragon Quest art in it.
10454276	10455037	It was awesome.
10455297	10458239	and the YouTube collection.
10459540	10460521	Oh yes, I saw that.
10460581	10461221	That was great.
10462182	10463283	Alright, well that's it guys.
10463503	10465604	Thank you so much for tuning in to Orange Lounge Radio.
10465624	10475131	We'll be back another week and next week it won't be April Fools anymore so it'll be a little more serious but we can still be a little silly tonight, right?
10475691	10476372	Have a good night.
10477150	10499788	That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange Lounge Radio production For more information about our station, visit our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day
10500709	10502450	God damn!
10503471	10504352	Ow, my foot!
10504852	10507054	Why did I shoot myself in my foot?
10507414	10509296	Oh my god, it hurts so bad!
10512358	10513399	No, my foot!
10513459	10514640	I need that for walking!
10515681	10517622	Somebody once told me what having a baby felt like.
10518203	10519944	Giving birth sucks and I'm never going to do it.
10519964	10523327	That's why they cut open your stomach and pull the damn kid out.
10523407	10525008	It's just like, what the hell's the point?
10525068	10529452	It's like trying to shove a piano through a door when there's a perfectly good window right there.
10533368	10536151	I don't see the point.
10538354	10540236	And that's why men will never have babies.
10540596	10543039	The genius of Loki on Orange Lounge Radio.
10543440	10546924	Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.
