538520	541180	So anyhow, we're here in studio
541800	547760	Chilling out to dynamite rave which always makes me think of your freestyle routine Loki. Yes, the one I forgot like
547760	554060	Like fuck it. I'm walking out up on stage. You just fucking froze didn't what did the judge? I didn't freeze
554060	556060	I just like I forgot it about
556400	562660	Halfway through it. I'm like and fuck it. What did the judges score you on that when I remember it was like a three
562660	565360	It's like long ago would have been better if you hadn't used mirror
566600	568600	probably
569760	573640	Good times. Well, how you doing dark Sakura? I
573640	580920	I want a burrito. Do you instead? I'm going to have tea. I thought you were doing this whole fasting thing
580920	584400	That's why I'm having tea. See Alan is being kind enough
584400	588280	He was gonna miss tonight was gonna be Taco Fest Eva here at Studio
588280	591320	OL are and he's been kind enough to postpone that until the show is over. I
592640	594080	appreciate it
594080	598620	No problem. We have a very busy schedule of news tonight
599040	602380	There was the Konami press event this week that just came out of the blue
602380	606060	The cannot I don't remember what's called the Konami kissa nieta or something like that
606060	612700	I think they were celebrating the 15th anniversary of something but we are gonna talk about all that another Frogger anniversary cuz goddamn that
612780	617960	No, I mean this we're gonna talk about Frogger on this show. Did you miss the part about it's Bemani? Yeah
617960	622340	I understand I understand that but you know, they like to throw out those Frogger anniversaries
622340	625680	We're celebrating the 23rd anniversary for it's like no fucking care
625680	627340	Maybe there will be a version of DDR
627340	632780	Well little little frogs will show up on the air on the little arrow pads and you can step on them to kill them
632820	634860	That would be it. I play that
635420	637420	It's like that spider stomp
637940	639940	exactly
639940	644860	And I have witnessed the spider stomp freestyle routine that was that was interest
644860	651300	How did the spider stop freestyle routine go down? It was it was explicit that did it. I'm I believe and
652140	654140	It was pretty awesome
654140	656760	No, no was explicit
656760	663680	I don't remember now wasn't an explicit routine because I've seen some of those in my ears of DDR festiva's and so forth
663680	667320	Ah, I don't remember. It was something that it came out when we went to
667960	669960	we had to play Q's are and
672200	675580	How does the spider stomp freestyle work I don't understand
675580	684500	It's just like DDR but spider stomp, you know, I step on the glowing bubbles what?
685340	688900	Nothing. I was just remembering went working in the arcade and having a spider stomp
689060	692120	Did you have a spider stomp it we did in Alabama?
692620	696900	Wherever it was you were when I worked at cyber station. We had a spider a spider shop. Mm-hmm
696900	700540	I was really good at spider stomp to saying no
700540	706420	I remember was now is a prestige routine or prestige. Oh that guy. Yeah, that guy was hilarious
707260	709260	Yeah, good times
709500	713620	All right. Well, we're gonna start off the show us we always do with a little bit of how was your week?
713620	715500	How was your day where we talk about?
715500	719460	Whatever the hell you want from this past week or day and so forth because you know
719460	724460	It is the home of all things Bamani and then some so this is the and then some part of it dark soccer ladies first
724660	725700	so, uh
725700	727700	Friday actually Thursday. I
727700	732460	I called my friend's new boss and said hey, I'd like to work there
733420	738980	Friday I went in for no. No, that was Wednesday because I was at school Thursday. I get a call back
739860	741860	asking how did you get the number and
742780	747540	Send me a resume then I get a call back after I interviewed for my had my second interview for eHarmony
747620	751100	And they're like, okay. Can you come in tomorrow? So I went in Friday
751700	753700	They like we like you
753700	762420	So now I have a job. I start my day. You got a job. Yay Kermit. Yeah, so eHarmony when they're you know, like for example
764820	771180	Checking out new candidates for job positions. Do they match them up with you know, different levels of compatibility, you know
772300	774300	They actually go through a recruiting service
774300	781780	Ah, maybe you're 80% compatible for this this job and maybe only 60% are your
782100	786420	Homosexual you cannot apply not true because they have a service called compatible partners now
787380	789380	Because they got sued into it
790180	793140	But yeah, so I got to send them a rejection letter
793860	796420	The eHarmony people how do you go about writing a rejection letter?
796420	799820	Are you really supposed to be talking about what company you said? No to I mean, I don't know
799820	803740	I I'm sure they don't listen to this show if they do. Sorry
803740	809380	I was like, I regret to inform you that I have chosen a more qualified position with another company
810900	818220	You know, I said they're paying me more it's it's you know better work more challenging more what I'm looking for. Give me money
818220	820220	I'm sorry. We're not a match
821740	824620	You stood up eHarmony, that's awesome. I
824620	829260	I mean honestly eHarmony like judging everything
829260	832300	They just seemed like a fantastic company to work for the working-from-home thing would've been cool
832900	834900	but you know, I have bills I
835540	838860	Need and on top of that I need to get out of the house
839580	843540	And how long how long is the job dry spell been going on now? It's been a little bit, right?
844620	847860	It's been bad. I got laid off November 2010. Oh, wow
848460	850460	So yeah, it's been a while
850460	857300	Um, but here's the funny thing. I will be working with my BFF Becky. We worked at the same last job
858100	863540	So that's not a recipe for disaster or anything. No, cuz we we know how to behave in a professional environment
863540	868260	We're doing two different jobs on top of that. You know, it's just it's gonna mean, you know nice
868900	870700	So very cool
870700	873500	Loki how was your week? How was your day? Uh
874500	877860	Mainly this week. It was just kind of I don't know
877860	879860	um back to work
880580	884960	Because last week I was off a couple days to watch Josh ball. Nellie was
885660	888060	Going to the doctor and stuff. Um, and then
889260	891260	What else I do
893580	898300	Slapped nothing. I didn't sleep that much actually. No, it was pretty much
900100	905660	Just always saw the Hunger Games last week, I think I already talked about that though
905660	907340	Uh
907340	909340	Nellie went and saw
910660	918340	The bodyguard in theaters what yeah because they had one night it was the 20th anniversary of the bodyguard and
919380	923840	and so she went and saw it in theaters and she said that the sound mix was horrible that they
924260	930580	Then when they I guess remastered it they remastered it in a tin can and so it just sounded very tinny
930580	936500	Does this mean that they're coming out with like a new blu-ray or something? That's yes. It came out on Tuesday actually and she wants that
936500	938180	Of course, she does
938180	942860	So yes, she she went but you wouldn't take her to see it. No forget. No, here's the thing
942860	945860	I had a movie screen to us was to be going to this week
946020	950320	Unfortunately, I didn't make it in in time because I didn't catch the email until a day later
950500	955220	But I had an opportunity to see Ted, but I I missed it
956060	958420	and Ted of course is the new comedy with
958420	961740	Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis
962500	964500	Which is being written by?
964700	971460	Seth MacFarlane, it's about a guy who wishes for his teddy bear to come alive one Christmas and then he does and so he has
971460	976000	This walking talking teddy bear, but now he's grown up. And so there's this teddy bear that's with him
976000	978000	That it's just like this boozing
978100	982100	Prostitute sleeping with you know, there's still that from an episode of supernatural
982100	984980	I'm like, I'm not sure how I feel about that. That sounds kind of scary
984980	989980	So they totally stole that from Supernatural. It sounded sounded funny, but unfortunately didn't get through that
989980	992940	Oh, and of course, you know, I played some DDR. So
993580	996140	That was my week. Absolutely. All right
997700	999700	Okay my week I
999780	1004740	Read a book y'all. I read a book. I read a book from start to finish
1004820	1009980	You can I did I can and I read a book. I read a book in like four days
1009980	1012980	I think I only took about four days. I read The Hunger Games
1012980	1014420	Okay
1014420	1018200	Let me I'm disappointed didn't I give you a copy of?
1019460	1021460	Ready player one. No
1021740	1026140	Well, I'm gonna give you a copy of ready player one cuz you want to read that. All right, I'll read ready
1026140	1030780	I'll give you both a copy of ready player one sweet. No, I I don't know why I read The Hunger Games
1030780	1033420	I mean, yes, I know it's a movie and all that stuff. Oh my god, I heard
1034020	1039100	But all my friends are reading it and just raving and raving about it and like won't shut up about what a good book
1039100	1041020	It is so I'm like fine. I'll check it out. I'll try it
1041020	1043580	And so I read the whole thing start to finish and it wasn't bad
1043700	1047900	so what did I do the day after I read The Hunger Games when saw the movie and
1048900	1051940	seeing the movie with everything so fresh in my mind was
1052540	1059640	It was easy for me to pick out everything that really bugged me about what they changed from the book and even Alan commented
1059640	1064440	Like I could tell every time they changed something from the book because I would just hear this deep sigh coming from over where you're at
1064440	1070480	Yeah, but I think according to my wife. She said that actually the movie is better than the book
1071560	1075280	They're different. I'm not gonna say one is better than the other. I think they were both good
1075280	1079920	They were both good in their own way, but because they moved the biggest problem
1080680	1085800	Quote-unquote with the translation is that because the book is first person and the movie's third person
1085920	1090100	There's a lot they have to do differently because you're not inside her head
1090100	1095380	So they have to use a lot of these other scenes to kind of explain what's going on because she can't do it in her
1095380	1100540	Head for you. So seeing these extra scenes was a little weird, but it wasn't bad
1100540	1107360	I like the visual translation of it all and can we stop can we stop can we stop with the battle royale comparisons?
1107900	1114140	Seriously, like I get it kids having to play the death to the match thing. Okay. Yes, lol. It's very similar, but
1114140	1119740	It's the same thing that was done in Stephen King's the long walk. It was the same thing that was done in Logan's run
1120540	1123340	Heck if you want to go all the way back to ancient Greek mythology
1123340	1128180	Wasn't the Minotaur maze the same thing like they would offer up kids to go in the Minotaur maze the miniatures of you know
1128180	1130300	I mean that was I mean it goes way way back
1130300	1136620	So it's not like like I hate to break it to you guys battle royale wasn't necessarily totally original either
1137900	1141820	I'm just a little offended that you would read the book for the Hunger Games, but you didn't read battle royale
1141820	1144380	I did try to read battle royale, but it was kind of boring
1144380	1150060	It was good, but I was telling a friend. This is that if I'm not in the exact right mood when I'm reading a book
1150060	1151660	then I'm gonna a
1151660	1156940	Squirrel do something else like my ADD so bad. So I'll try to read battle royale. That's because you can't read
1156940	1159580	I will that's because you weren't reading ready player one
1160460	1162460	Maybe that maybe that
1162460	1167660	So but I liked um, of course, I liked battle royale. I'm not dogging on battle royale
1167660	1172060	I'm not dogging on battle royale. It's a fine movie and hell many years ago on this show
1172060	1177500	We used to talk about you know, didn't we start off one show with a paper plate battle royale one night?
1177500	1182260	I seem to remember it was really funny and stupid and you know what I have to say about the movie and it being you
1182260	1189160	Know brought over here in the US the US soundtrack is far superior than the Japanese soundtrack for that movie really
1189160	1191160	Yes, it is
1191300	1194380	far superior interesting. All right, I
1194380	1196380	I
1196820	1198420	See what you did there
1198420	1201900	So I'm trying to think what else is going on my week because dark soccer is not in the room right now
1201900	1204980	And I want to wait for her to get back so we can do the news. I
1206860	1209900	Don't know I've been very kind of much a homebody I
1210700	1216780	Didn't get a new job this week. I've been at the same job for ten years, but I like my jobs. It's okay. So I
1216780	1223400	I we went to the movies just say that we went out to Chinese food, which was good
1224020	1226620	This is great radio in that. Yeah
1228420	1232280	Do you think maybe I should do a break song and then we'll come back and we'll talk about what's going on in the news
1232280	1233740	this week, uh
1233740	1239460	Yeah, sure. All right, we're gonna do a quick break. We're gonna come back and we'll talk about what is in the news this week
1239460	1257060	There's a lot of stuff. So stay tuned guys. We'll be right back on more of orange launch radio
1269460	1271460	Oh
1299460	1301460	Oh
1329460	1331460	Hi
1334820	1338900	We're back dark soccer is all better. She's back joining us
1340340	1342340	Instinct up the bathroom. Did you know?
1343740	1349740	Good if you must know I had to pee. Thank you. Ah, la la la la TMI
1350540	1354640	alright, so news there's lots and lots of Omani news going on this week because
1354640	1360240	Konami had a surprise key Sanyara event, which surprise we weren't invited to what a shock
1361840	1367220	You think we're covering bimani this long that you know, we'd be the top of the list but no no no
1367220	1373800	No, we're award-winning bimani podcast. I know they needed the seats for g4. So what can you do?
1374320	1376520	Anyhow, so there was lots of news to come out of the event
1376520	1381760	This is this is crazy to me, but there is a brand new dancing stage game announced
1381760	1385680	Which as you know is the name for it over in Europe?
1385680	1390080	But they've also used this in Japan before for artists exclusive games and they're going back to that
1390080	1393900	Like what was the last dancing stage game? We had dancing stage featuring dreams come true
1394120	1398120	Yeah, was it I couldn't remember if dreams come true or true kiss destination one of them
1398120	1403400	It was back in like 99 or 2000 what which for the record? I found my copy of that Wow
1403880	1410620	Well, you can get it out to celebrate because they've announced dancing stage featuring Lady Gaga is coming
1410620	1415520	Awesome. I know right? Yeah, it's the first artist exclusive game since dancing stage
1416200	1420400	the older ones dreams come true and true kiss destination
1421000	1425960	Lady Gaga songs, of course, they have to be in every single music game ever released, of course, right?
1425960	1428280	So it just made sense that she's gonna get her own
1428640	1430160	Dancing stage game now
1430160	1431960	We don't know all the songs that are gonna be in it
1431960	1436560	But we do know bad romances in it because that was the song that they demoed in the trailer which makes sense
1436960	1439600	Do you think bad romance would be a tough DDR song?
1439600	1443020	Do you think that'll be like a seven or an eight or a nine or what? I put it in seven
1443020	1448680	Yeah, I could see I could see them doing like some runs or the I lots of I remember correctly
1448680	1453760	I believe the true kiss destination and the dreams come true stuff. Those songs weren't that hard
1453760	1457760	I think it was like six and sevens were the highest because it's more of the casual
1458840	1461560	Casual DDR player kind of that they're targeting there
1461560	1465360	So you think you think that the Lady Gaga audition is gonna be dumbed down a little bit
1465360	1469680	I think yeah, it's not gonna be you're not gonna have like, you know paranoia level stuff in there
1469680	1473480	It's just gonna be kind of you know, sixes and sevens, you know more stuff
1473480	1477560	That's fun to dance to and less of more of it less of a challenge
1477560	1480080	I guess unless I did a paranoia remix club para gaga
1480560	1484400	They're not gonna do that. I I'm so on the board with this idea para gaga
1485520	1489320	They're not gonna do something like that or how that better game para para gaga
1490240	1492800	Maybe maybe if this one does very well now
1492800	1497200	What's weird is that they haven't talked about any home releases for this. So this is like an arcade exclusive thing
1497640	1501000	But that's usually how it works. You know, they'll have a home release later on
1502000	1506720	They'll just dump it into the engine of like a dance dance, you know revolution game or something like that
1506720	1507680	Yeah, that makes sense
1507680	1508160	No
1508160	1510160	This is really weird because I get did the other
1510500	1516100	Dancing stage games have like a couple songs from other artists like a couple of Konami originals in it
1516100	1521900	I don't remember because I found this really weird. There is actually a Katy Perry song in this game to
1521900	1528220	California girls is apparently gonna be playable in this game. It's in the press release, but it's only available in basic mode
1529340	1534860	Really strange. Yes, something about Katy Perry is only basic. So yeah only available in basic
1535320	1538080	So I go figure I guess, you know
1538400	1542340	Be a very casual relaxed on but I could definitely see some freestyle to that
1542340	1545860	I could definitely see Wendell busting out a California girl
1545960	1549160	Perhaps they're going even so far as to like say, you know
1549160	1553560	How they did with kind of some of the other mixes where they'll have a preview of the following mix
1553560	1560840	Maybe they're they're previewing the Katy Perry version or maybe getting the reception for the Katy Perry version before
1561100	1567340	They actually come out and put out full release for it. That makes sense. If people hate that then that's right
1567340	1574800	It's like oh, whoa, whoa, stop if they go like this this chick is too basic. Then they will reject the Katy Perry mix
1574800	1576920	Yeah, that could possibly come out later
1576920	1581240	So on a scale of one to ten, how important is the dancing stage featuring Lady Gaga news?
1582580	1584580	That's a seven. I
1584900	1586900	Just don't care
1587140	1592720	Really? I mean, well, hey more more dancing stage DVR mixes are a good thing, I guess so I'll give it a five
1593340	1599680	I'll give it an 11 because there's nothing in the world. I love more than DDR and Lady Gaga. So there you go
1600220	1602580	No, what if it was RuPaul's?
1602580	1610980	Dancing stage featuring RuPaul's Drag Race dancing stage featuring Abba I would so you're right that would that would be a 12 if it was
1610980	1616740	Dancin say that you would get a ps3 when an Abba game came out and sure enough sing star Abba came out and guess what?
1616740	1618740	I got did you ever pick up that?
1618960	1622280	The Abba you can dance. Yes, I did
1622280	1626460	That was the best thing I've ever seen in my entire life if we were hooked up to do it
1626460	1630360	I would play it live on air tonight, but sadly we're not oh darn darn
1630360	1633580	Yeah, what a bummer. That was seriously the happiest moment of my life
1634380	1639800	What watching me play that watching you do the ballet style stuff for?
1640380	1645340	The winner takes it all. Mm-hmm. That was the best thing I've ever seen. All right, well
1645940	1647940	Let's move on to the other big piece of news
1648540	1651600	from the Konami key scenario event that had to do with the money and
1651980	1655860	This kind of was a surprise because you guys know we've been saying this on the show for years this
1655860	1660520	Series was really underrated and a lot of people gave this series a lot of shit
1660520	1662520	And it was actually really good if you play it
1663280	1665080	Yeah
1665080	1667080	so the game that is
1667720	1674520	Announced rock revolution 2 has been announced. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you're talking about good series rock revolution 2
1675120	1677520	was announced for consoles and arcade
1678280	1682920	So there I guess it's kind of like well, I mean if it's arcades and they're probably just renaming
1682920	1688040	You know guitar freaks germania probably I think they're trying to americanize it a little bit or maybe they ran out of mixed numbers
1688360	1693160	Could be the what they didn't know and this is Konami. I don't think they'll ever run out of mixed numbers
1693160	1694360	But this is this is interesting
1694360	1700380	Konami is actually thinking outside of the box and doing something a little different here rock revolution to the console versions
1700380	1704360	Will link up to the arcades using Konami's transferring
1704600	1710000	So you're actually going to be able to take your unlocks your characters and whatever settings you have in the home version
1710000	1713080	You can take those and transfer them into the arcade
1713760	1715440	It's got neat. Yeah
1715440	1718160	Now I'm wondering if like, you know, cuz one thing that you know
1718160	1722160	You used to be able to do was the whole edits and you could you know, save your edits down to a memory card
1722160	1724880	But you never really were able to do that in guitar freaks to draw mania
1724880	1730440	So maybe maybe this is gonna be like some type of like jam session and you could transfer that into the arcade
1731320	1735400	Could I play it could would this allow me to play guar in the arcade? Yes or no?
1735400	1738840	I don't know. Maybe it would probably be something more like
1738840	1740840	You know, you could take your
1742000	1748160	Ranked like say you score something like a high score on a song and you can take that to the arcade and take it home
1748160	1751800	And that way it's still linked to your you know, Konami profile or whatever
1752280	1753640	I
1753640	1758600	Don't know as long as they improve the drum controller for the home version because that was terrible
1758600	1760720	But I understand why they're doing something like this
1760720	1765280	I mean if you think about it, there's not really new guitar games coming out aside from you know
1765280	1769720	Some of the ones actually use real guitars. There's not any plastic instrument games anymore
1769720	1773400	There's a lot of plastic instruments that people have that are just collecting dust
1773400	1779120	It's time to you know dust those things off and actually play another music game dark soccer. You're awfully quiet
1779120	1781820	Does the prospect of a rock revolution to excite you?
1782320	1785440	Not really why I didn't play the rock revolution one. I
1786440	1792080	Was busy. Maybe it's time to catch up. I've been too busy with para para lately
1792080	1795860	so anything new right now is just sort of like
1796380	1799640	But but I want to wave my arms and wear pink and you know
1801040	1803040	platform boots and who doesn't
1804740	1812800	You know, I think I think that if they if they keep up with like I like the transferring element to it
1813440	1819480	That can make it exciting. Mm-hmm, but I still would have to wait for judging the final
1819480	1821480	Right
1823120	1826040	All we have are these fluffy press releases and things
1826680	1831920	So I don't really want to get excited until I see something. Mm-hmm now some folks in our chat room
1831920	1836160	Which by the way, I still have not plugged the chat room. It is we are no longer on Cali Bamani calm
1836160	1841560	So don't go there. You want to go to chat that orange on traded calm that changed recently. We're not on Cali Bamani
1841560	1843480	It's chat that orange on traded calm
1843480	1848720	So check that out and Tiger class says will rock revolution to have connect support on the 360
1848720	1850000	maybe
1850000	1852800	It's it's certainly possible. Anything's possible. I
1853360	1860920	Could see it. I mean, you know economy's done some connect enabled games recently. So why not? Why not exactly now?
1860920	1866600	I was curious what harmonix was gonna do in response to this and it looks like harmonix is cutting them off
1866600	1881960	Did you notice did you harmonix release this today? Did you guys see this? This is pretty amazing product not yet rated
1881960	1883960	It's Rock Band Board Game
1883960	1885960	That's
1896440	1900960	Right Rock Band Board Game is the newest game from harmonix musical system
1901320	1906880	Featuring all the fun and authenticity of Rock Band without the hassle of big bulky instruments
1907120	1912400	See that that seems like a dig a little bit at Konami like the whole like you don't need instruments for this
1912400	1915880	That's dig and board game who who would have thought Konami?
1916520	1923800	Advancing technology with trans faring and all this stuff harmonix scaling back. I really don't understand the direction. They're trying to go there
1923800	1930800	It's I did the whole separation from MTV games. I was worried about that when they announced that but this this is interesting
1930800	1933720	It's an interesting tactic. They're going after the pen and paper crowd
1935040	1941200	It is an untapped market. That's true. I mean, you know once this happens what's to say? We can't get you know, Rock Band the RPG
1941200	1945040	That's very true. You know, actually let me let me did you see the dice?
1947360	1952520	Rock Band Board Game has a larger song library than any other rhythm action board game
1956280	1959840	Yeah, set this challenge drop three red song cards
1959840	1969840	Say it ain't so. Tubular. Say it ain't so. Again. Okay. Say it ain't so.
1971280	1975400	And what do I do notice say it ain't so I end up playing that an awful lot in Rock Band
1975400	1980960	That is that is hopefully they'll put out a patch to just you know, it's not that I hate that song
1980960	1984680	I'm like really maybe you should pick another song. Yeah, I think you've played this enough. Yeah, exactly
1984680	1992040	The Rock Band features you've come to love the party will never stop rocking features like character creator
1993040	1996620	See now this that is a direct attack on the pen and paper market. Look at that
1997140	2001440	They have a calibration character sheets and they're making their own characters
2001440	2003360	So it's kind of like, you know
2003360	2008160	You are only so limited to what you could do on the console versions like there are only so many hats
2008160	2014560	Yeah, but now you can draw your own damn hat exactly. It's amazing and give it its own stats and everything
2014560	2017720	It was very interesting watching the different directions these two companies go in
2018360	2019760	so
2019760	2024280	So Rock Revolution 2 how amazing is this news on a scale of 1 to 10 Loki?
2025720	2028000	It all depends on how good it is. I mean cuz
2028760	2035140	It could be very terrible or it could be very good. I don't know. I'm not ready to radiate yet
2035140	2040380	All right, fair enough dark Sakura. I'm just gonna say a 6 for my excitement level. I'll wait and see
2040900	2046180	I'm gonna give it a 9 because I'm just excited that Rock Revolution is coming back
2046180	2051700	I'm very excited this whole thing sounds like it's gonna be amazing and push technology forward. All right one more story
2051700	2054760	We've got to cover tonight. This did not come out of the event. But oh my god
2054760	2058860	It was like timed at the exact same time or so. It's crazy. I couldn't say anything about it either
2058860	2065380	I know what is up with that? You're supposed to be like our inside scoop to this. I had an NDA. I'm sorry. Yeah, fuck
2065380	2069220	Yo, NDA and I wanted to go to Las Vegas again. All right. All right, here's the here it is you guys
2069940	2076380	DDR freak extreme has been announced. That's right a press release j-dog the owner of DDR freak calm
2076380	2080860	of course put out a press release this week that simply said we are starting over and
2081380	2085420	They are gonna relaunch DDR freak. It's gonna be DDR freak extreme
2085420	2092000	Calm there will be an upgraded machine locations database that will have Google Maps integration with it
2092000	2094600	Which I think is that's smart, right and everything's on Google Maps now
2094600	2099440	And they're gonna have brand new forums because you're the forums were starting to get be a little bit of a problem
2099440	2105200	Right dark soccer you were moderate. Yeah, so they're gonna do brand new forums and what they're doing. They're actually gonna let
2106040	2112120	Random topics have their own sub forums. So the wolf game is now gonna have its own sub forum and
2112120	2118340	And pornography posts will have its own sub forum. Yeah, there's actually a code written into the PHP BB
2118340	2120800	Yes, that's gonna allow any of those
2121420	2128260	External sites that like to traffic through forums that they all just go directly there. Oh, that's very own forum
2128260	2131780	You know because when I think where am I gonna go to get porno links?
2132300	2138300	DDR free and it's also for the goat's-a-pix and the bukkake and everything. That's great lemon party
2138300	2143500	Well, there would be like a sub sub forum. I mean, I'm sure there will do girls one cup reaction
2143500	2147560	But we have to have a moderator for that with a very strong stomach. I see
2147560	2151460	Well, you know, how did you audition people for that who ended up getting that?
2152180	2154460	Some guy with these initials RJ
2155900	2157900	He's apparently some overweight old actor
2159780	2163900	Figure yeah, I don't know. I mean he sent a picture dudes got
2165240	2166500	anyway
2166500	2169500	So anyway, so you're welcome to have it Ron
2170020	2171180	All right, awesome
2171180	2177820	So but um, the other thing that is actually gonna be that I finally got the okay to talk about wait
2177820	2179140	Is this like an exclusive?
2179140	2184460	It could be an exclusive is DDR freak radio gonna get pissed off because that might be a little weird because you know
2184460	2186460	There's the two radio stations. Well
2186740	2192700	There was a little talk about they wanted to acquire us what?
2192700	2198980	So like we're gonna be the official radio state. What's gonna happen to DDR freak radio? Well, it's gone
2200220	2204620	They had to start over remember. Oh, okay. I get it. Yeah, so
2206300	2207820	Well, I
2207820	2211520	Guess so, but I mean, but all games radios treated us so well over the years
2211540	2216720	Well, no, they what it is would be like a partnership where they want us to be the official podcaster for DDR news
2216780	2218780	Okay. Yeah, so with that
2218780	2224620	So that could work heck. Yeah, so DDR freak extreme. Are you excited to post there again? Loki?
2225380	2227380	Hell, yeah, I'd be awesome. Yeah
2227620	2233460	Good idea to get the community back together exactly. There's the other thing too. That is kind of hush-hush. Okay?
2233460	2237340	Oh, I love it CD our flash. What's this that works with the USB dance pad?
2238300	2239820	Huh?
2239820	2245660	So like integrated into the site. Yeah. Oh, can you do like your own music and stuff that I don't know yet
2245660	2251220	They're still working on licensing. I see. You can actually browse the forums using the dance pad. Ah, it's cool
2251220	2253220	I like that idea. I like that idea
2253540	2259820	Especially especially if you're looking at the porn forums, but they've actually um, very you've actually done a Kinect hack
2260740	2263820	As well so that you can navigate the site with your Kinect controller
2263820	2267620	There was the 1.5 release of Kinect on PC and have full integration
2268140	2270140	Very cool. Yeah, so
2270460	2273380	DDR freak extreme let's go around and rate the
2273380	2279420	Importance of that news on a scale of 1 to 10 a dark Sakura totally a 10 DDR freak was the best time
2279420	2281420	I ever had biased biased
2282780	2284060	Loki, uh
2284060	2288140	Eight we always need more places for porn links. That's true. That's true
2288140	2293500	I would normally give it an 8 but the porn forum 9 it's just it's very important. So maybe
2294420	2297100	Well, and you the other thing too, is it for people who are offended?
2298060	2301780	They just don't have to click on it. That's right. Don't click it. It's the best thing ever
2301780	2307220	And they oh, oh, I have to tell you about the other form. They got at it. What a little cat form
2307860	2314780	All little cats how nice that they've evolved with the rest of the internet. I know that's great. Okay. Yeah
2314780	2318160	I have to shut my mouth before I let out the whole
2318820	2324340	Grid thing. Well the users that were banned last time still be banned. We're gonna make them their own forum. Oh
2324340	2331740	Oh, like the troll grounds or something. We're gonna call it hall of the band. Hmm. I like that. It's a catchy name
2332860	2335980	Alright, well don't go anywhere guys. We have plenty more show to come
2335980	2339780	We have the cage match is coming up in just a little bit F use of the week and we might
2340220	2342420	Just have to play match game. Yay
2342420	2355100	All right, so we'll be back after this with more of orange lounge radio after a quick break
2372420	2374420	Oh
2402420	2404420	Oh
2432420	2434420	Oh
2449260	2451580	All right, one two three
2454060	2457820	Okay, so obviously everything we just did was bullshit
2457820	2461700	Actually, well the stuff we did this week. That was all true, right?
2463100	2465100	Except for the para para
2465140	2467740	Finding my copy of dreams come true because mine was a burn
2469180	2474540	All the stories we talked about sadly were fake. I mean really the Konami keys in your event, please
2475060	2478740	So we made all that shit up and DER freak is people outside, California
2478740	2483300	Don't know what those are some folks in chat generally got excited that DDR freak was coming back
2484140	2485580	Sorry
2485580	2489860	Don't be mad. Don't sue us. I'm thoroughly glad I don't have to moderate
2491180	2492580	anymore
2492580	2498340	Because um, you know what? I actually have to tell you about a realization that I had. Hmm. What's that?
2498340	2500860	I went back and read on one site
2501500	2507660	The graffiti that they found on the walls in Pompeii. Mm-hmm, and it made me think of the same shit
2507660	2515780	I would see on DDR freak which proves to me that in the last however many thousand years humanity has not grown at all. So
2516180	2520440	Trolls even back in the olden days. No, there was there was one post that said so and so
2521420	2523420	like
2523780	2526220	Did some girl in the ass here and
2527060	2530340	Ran away with her and ran away with her brother. How naughty
2531060	2533700	Alright, so anyway, um, yeah everything we just did was bull
2533700	2539900	But we thought it would be fun for our especially because it's the tenth year of olr and April Fool's happens to be on a Sunday
2539900	2545400	And look, we're never gonna top the giggling lesbian gaming show that we did in 2006, which will always be the best prank we ever did
2546060	2549180	We thought we'd do that for our little April Fool's gag. So there you go
2550740	2557060	Anyhow, let's get back into the real show because there's been a lot of stuff going on in the gaming world this week that we want
2557060	2559260	to touch on big big news
2559260	2566660	Rumor news that I think Loki said might take the whole damn show tonight. So we're gonna talk about that a little bit as well
2567340	2570200	First though the real version of what we do at the top of the show
2570340	2574860	How was your gaming week talking about the video games? We've played this week dark soccer
2574860	2576740	You want to start us off with video games? You've been playing this week
2576740	2580780	I looked at that copy of Mass Effect and then Dan and I talked about it and then I got too busy to play
2581060	2583520	Because I was busy getting a job shame on you
2583520	2589440	Busy getting a job fine. I guess a job will be an acceptable. Excuse me. I did play
2589480	2594760	Well, of course you did. Of course I did because you have an addiction. Uh-huh dealer
2595760	2602120	Loki how was your gaming week? My game week was alright. I didn't play a whole lot of play Call of Duty. Yeah, I know
2603960	2607340	And then I also played
2609240	2611240	What was it the
2611240	2612480	a
2612480	2614400	saxophone game I
2614400	2616400	posted it's a
2617920	2619920	God I can't remember now
2622240	2626240	Anyways, so little internet game was kind of fun
2629360	2632400	Is it sax maniacs it was epic sax game
2633120	2637120	All right, based off of the epic sax guy from oh
2637120	2644440	Oh, yeah, it's hilarious because it's actually use it little music rhythm game and you have to learn how to play that little
2645320	2650320	Bit of music there and then you keep playing it over and over again
2651960	2657680	There's a lot of songs out there that have epic sax solos in them so hot sax all night long
2658400	2662040	Well, this is specifically the epic sax guy. All right
2662040	2667080	Specifically you've ever seen the original that that came from the original song
2667280	2672640	No, the original video that the SNL got the idea from it's not SNL
2672640	2676720	I don't think where the guy bust through the window and the curse
2677840	2679920	I'm talking about I'm talking about it's
2681280	2683280	It's a epic sax guy from
2683880	2688080	What the hell was it? I can't remember the group now. I haven't looked at it's all good
2688080	2693560	Eurovision, it was part of this Eurovision thing the
2694120	2699160	Was that that big competition? That's like American Idol or whatever. Yeah, sort of in manova is oh
2699160	2701360	I know what you're talking about. Never mind a note
2701360	2703160	You're talking about the guy wearing, you know
2703160	2711040	The blue pants and the red gloves kind of looks like Duke Nukem hip thrusting to his epic sax solo and hot
2711040	2712800	It's awesome song
2712800	2716880	All right. So that it for your gaming week. That is all I play this week
2716880	2721000	My gaming week was kind of quick to not a whole lot to talk about I got into the mr
2721000	2722600	Pandaria beta so I was playing that a little bit
2722600	2726040	But if you're not in there, don't be sad because it's just a giant cluster fuck
2726040	2730560	It's a big panda orgy in the starting zones. They kind of need more beta servers
2730560	2736040	But at the same time it's just a beta like people I think often think oh when you're in the mr
2736040	2740360	Pandaria beta you're getting the real game, but you're not it's a beta
2740680	2744300	So been playing that a little little bit otherwise on the consoles
2744300	2749860	I'm still plucking away at Mass Effect 2. I think I'm about halfway through the game from what Shane tells me
2750360	2756200	I've you know picked up some of my partners and now I've got a few more I did some events on a planet and it
2756200	2759620	Unlocks some more dossiers for those of you that play the game. You can kind of tell where I'm at
2760240	2762240	Still love in the Mass Effect series
2763120	2767880	The battle system has gotten a little better for me because you might remember last week on the show
2767880	2772880	I was bitching about the battles in Mass Effect 2 compared to one but I'm liking it a little more now that I have more
2772880	2778080	Abilities I really like that you can kind of take an ability from one of your loyal
2778960	2781760	Companions because I have some of the DLC companions
2781760	2785020	I have Zaid and Kasumi who are some DLC companions
2785020	2788880	And I really like that I could take because I don't like Zaid as a character
2788880	2793660	I don't want him in my party ever but that flash or that grenade inferno grenade. He has is awesome
2793660	2796680	So I took that ability from him. So I've been using that
2797360	2799360	But Mass Effect 2 still awesome
2799360	2805120	Uh, that's really about it. I play. Oh, no one other game. I've got to talk about this is important
2805120	2809240	I haven't played this a lot, but I played it a little bit. So I'll talk about it a little bit. Ah
2809760	2815240	Kid Icarus uprising I played some of that actually I got on the 3ds. Yeah, what'd you think? It's cool
2815240	2820600	Yeah, the 3d actually works. Yeah, the 3d is great. It's a gorgeous game. I was really
2821360	2827200	Into the way that it's set up like Super Smash Brothers to like the menus and everything will just like Super Smash Brothers
2827200	2832560	I like the customizing your weapons the thing. Yeah, I mean there's so many little I mean you can tell it's designed
2832560	2833880	I mean, hello. I'm not stupid
2833880	2836840	I know it's the same people that did Smash Brothers that did this but
2837160	2841400	It has all those same minigames like for Smash Brothers like, you know
2841400	2845320	The machine where you put in coins and you can get like an egg, you know
2845320	2848480	That has something special in it power up the grid of unlocks
2848480	2851360	I mean, there's tons and tons and tons of stuff in the game
2852080	2853640	and
2853640	2858600	I love the air stages in the game. It is so awesome
2860120	2865200	Here yes, it's beautiful to look at too and I love it when it's on rails and all this
2865800	2871640	then it gets to the ground stages and it's not that I dislike the ground stages, but
2871960	2876320	That's where and I think you know any of you that have been reading reviews about the game
2876320	2878120	the controls are
2878120	2883880	Not good for the ground stages because you I mean just the way you have to hold the controller
2884000	2892200	You have to move with the little circle pad you shoot with the L button and then you flick on the bottom pad
2892520	2897920	Left and right real quick to spin your character left and right and you use it to move your Targeter
2898600	2901120	So it's kind of a lot going on with that touchscreen
2901120	2905080	You have to hold it very awkward and yes Kid Icarus comes with that stand
2905080	2910640	But that kind of defeats the purpose of having a portable gaming system. We have to kind of like use that stand so
2911160	2913800	The controls disappoint me a little bit
2914360	2921520	but otherwise it's it's really a shame that something like that really screws the game in the way that it does because I
2922400	2928640	Love the storytelling and the videos and tutorial videos and all that in it because they break the fourth wall
2928640	2936440	Constantly constantly and all these in jokes like the game was made for people that remember the old Kid Icarus and constantly
2936440	2937520	They're like you know
2937520	2937800	Oh
2937800	2944040	it's been 25 years since we last saw Medusa and then it'll show like it says here's a picture of Medusa and it changes to
2944040	2947960	That hideous looking thing from the eight big Kid Icarus and somebody writes Medusa in an arrow
2947960	2951640	And it points at it like all these really dumb things and you know kind of some of those
2952040	2956500	adult level jokes that kids wouldn't get but adults do and a lot of that is
2956500	2958500	really funny
2958820	2961620	Going to our chat room at chat orange lounge radio.com
2962180	2967620	Game girl says is it worth it was thinking of getting Kid Icarus uprising. It really depends on
2968860	2974180	How how tied you are to this series and all that, you know, I paid 30 bucks for it
2974180	2979140	Which I think is a fair price. I got I think Best Buy had a discount so Amazon price matched it
2979140	2981140	So I got it for that price. Um
2981140	2987500	40 might be a little steep depending on you know, I wish there was a mode and maybe there will be one at the end
2987500	2992260	where you could just play the sky stages because the sky stages are where this game is the best because you don't have to
2992260	2996420	worry about turning pit and you just use the thing to move them and you use the
2997220	3003860	touchpad to move the targeting and the game is fantastic and it's at its best in those stages and the 3d looks great
3004140	3008780	But otherwise the ground stages kind of take away from the rest of the game for me
3008780	3012940	But I still think it's a solid 3ds game. I think it's definitely worth
3012940	3016620	Hopefully they'll put out a demo or something so you can kind of evaluate if it's for you
3016620	3021100	I want it to do well because I like the idea of the Kid Icarus series coming back
3021580	3024700	But I'm not gonna sit here and say the game is flawless when it's not
3024980	3029980	It's bad they couldn't patch it they use the circle pad Pro as you know, well you actually can
3030820	3036940	If you're a lefty because the lefty controls are using the circle pad Pro and then using your left hand for the stylus
3036940	3042100	I understand that but I meant like, you know the second analog instead of the touchpad. Mm-hmm
3042500	3046340	Well, I want to say there was customizable controls in there, too
3046340	3049500	So maybe there's a way you can kind of fix it and maybe kind of do that
3049500	3053780	But I can't see the problem is if you did that Loki then you'd have nothing to use to target
3053860	3058460	You'd have to move and then pick up your stylus and target and it would be kind of disjointed
3058460	3060460	You do you still write analog to target?
3060460	3067460	Mmm, yeah, but then how would you turn your screen you still have to use your stylus to turn the screen that's stupid
3067460	3072600	Yeah, so that that exact person shooters don't have that problem. Why why does this have to be an issue with?
3073220	3076960	You know this game. Yes. It's a little little little rough there
3077540	3081980	Pork chop and chat says I've never played Kid Icarus ever but uprising looks awesome
3082100	3084980	Let me talk about this real quick because it's a pre-order bonus
3084980	3092400	I got the Kid Icarus 3d classics, which is the 3d version of the regular game and it's actually really good
3092700	3095300	Like even though it's just the regular Kid Icarus
3095500	3102940	they put these backgrounds in every level where the 3d is not just the back like the the backgrounds themselves are kind of 3d and
3103780	3110920	I think the game is based off the disk system version and not the cartridge because there's load and save files
3110920	3116680	Which only existed in the disk version and I want to say the sound effects were slightly different
3116680	3119920	Which I remember the disk system had a different sound chip than the NES did
3120000	3125360	So some of the games had slightly different sound effects. So that was kind of cool. You should hear the music in the
3125960	3130440	Disk version of Castlevania 3. Yeah, I always hear the Castlevania 3. He's got a good little but yeah
3130440	3134880	Kid Icarus actually had a really good music on the disk one. Hmm and the sound
3134880	3141920	Shane in our chat room says Kid Icarus used to be worse for the 3ds at e3 the ground stages were timed and you had
3141920	3146120	To get through checkpoints. So they at least fix that. Oh, thank god, that would have been that would have been really bad
3146120	3148800	I'm glad they changed that that sounds terrible
3150400	3154520	But anyway, the 3d classic is actually really good and I wish
3155100	3157480	Every game got this kind
3157480	3162480	I wish they would do this for every virtual console game because it's not that much that they did
3162480	3169400	You know, they added backgrounds and they kind of the 3d is done tastefully. I think that's the best way I can put it
3169400	3174960	It's not like you've got one sprite layer here and then your background layer. It's not it's more than that
3175000	3181800	There's multi level of 3d and I think it the effects are really good and it kind of it
3181800	3182480	You know what?
3182480	3186260	It feels like to me is it feels like remember how everybody was talking about way back in the day
3186640	3190400	Kid Icarus on the Super Nintendo and a re-release of Kid Icarus on the Super Nintendo
3190400	3193000	And there are all these rumors and probably April Fool's Day jokes in the past
3193240	3195240	this feels to me like
3195360	3200680	What Kid Icarus would have been on the Super Nintendo and it's not necessarily that they like upgraded the sprites and all that
3200680	3202840	but just the way it looks and it's really crisp and
3203640	3205800	Makes it look like a Super Nintendo version of Kid Icarus
3205840	3211880	So I was I was a fan of the 3d release quite a bit. So I'm really looking forward to seeing what else
3212600	3213800	Oh
3213800	3218120	God, what's the name of the developer that did the 3ds versions called?
3218120	3223160	It's like it's not Akira, but Acura or something like that did all the
3224360	3226360	I'm looking on my 3ds right now
3227000	3228040	Arika
3228040	3232000	Did the 3d and they've done some good they did the excite bike one as well
3232000	3236440	Which I wasn't quite as big of a fan of but they did the Kirby one, which is really good, too
3236440	3241280	So I'm looking forward to seeing what Arika does next because they're kind of starting to get this down
3241840	3245160	This whole translating the old games into new stuff. So
3245160	3248520	Alpha kenanagram in our chat room with the tip says just an fYI
3249200	3256680	To people that do have any 3d classic games on 3ds and didn't notice you can go into options and increase the 3d density
3256840	3262440	Setting even more if it's not strong enough on max if setting is untouched. Yes, that's true
3262440	3264680	Not just the 3d density on the slider
3264680	3269120	But there's a 3d density within the game that you can adjust which I think is a good idea. So
3269760	3271760	There you go. That was a good idea
3271760	3276960	So there you go. That was my gaming week. I've talked plenty about that
3276960	3284720	So let's move on then quick housekeeping visit us on twitter twitter.com slash olr our facebook facebook.com slash orange lounge radio
3285160	3290160	Quickly go answer the frugal question of the week before we get to that a little later here in the show if you're listening live
3290160	3291920	And of course if you are listening live
3291920	3296360	Since we didn't get to say it at the top of the show because of our little joke tonight a big thank you as always
3296360	3303040	To all games radio where we do tape live every Sunday night at 6 o'clock Pacific 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Black Wolf show
3303040	3306680	Although not tonight Bobby's on a little break. He'll be back on the 15th
3307760	3309760	Let's get into some gaming news. Loki
3310440	3312440	Alright, so there's a big old
3313040	3315040	big old fun rumor
3315200	3317200	regarding
3317760	3324360	The next PlayStation system apparently there is sources that contacted Kotaku or
3324360	3325840	kotaku
3325840	3330400	Contacted anyways, they figured out that the working title or possible
3331280	3333880	name for the system is Orbis and
3334880	3336880	That it's being planned for release
3338080	3343880	Sometime next holiday. So 2013 holiday isn't Orbis a travel website. No, that's orbit
3345000	3351680	Isn't Orbis a drink that has these little gummy things in it. That's it was disgusting. That's that was orbits. Oh
3351680	3354320	My god, it's like you were drowning herpes
3354320	3361240	Now the name for the actual console is legit because you can pull up the dev website for PlayStation and you know
3361240	3366380	Typing in Orbis or like, you know slash Orbis or whatever pulls up the actual dev site
3366380	3368980	It's just it you don't get a 404 from it
3368980	3373640	So they have it built in place, but they just don't have anything there yet kind of like with the Vita
3374120	3377860	You know when you would you type that in and it would get a page
3377860	3385100	Yeah, Orbis SC done. That's on Sony site. Yes, Orbis SC dev.net their dev site
3386420	3390300	The name is the name is real. It's a real name or it's a
3391100	3393100	Okay. Yeah
3393940	3398180	So that's real at least now some of the specs though
3398180	3407860	they're saying right now that they're planning on it's using an AMD x64 CPU also an AMD Southern Islands GPU and
3407860	3414180	you know what they're saying right now is that supposed to be able to push a 4k HD, which is
3415180	3420200	Way more than most TVs can use although newer TVs do support it. It's a four
3421580	3423220	4096 by
3423220	3428420	760 it's a resolution far, you know exceeding most HD TVs and
3428980	3432980	Then also they're saying that's capable of playing 3d games in 1080p
3433620	3436620	Whereas you know the ps3 can only do that at 720
3439020	3445320	Also, I just want to say so far I can believe it that they're pushing the technical limits because if you think about it when
3445340	3450380	PlayStation 3 came out not everybody had adopted blu-ray yet or even HD TVs and
3450380	3455340	That was the technology they went with so I could kind of see that. Here's the problem though
3455340	3459820	I have well, I'll cover what my issues are with the news in a sec
3461420	3467460	Also, they're saying you right now that select developers have dev kits already which makes sense
3467460	3470820	I mean, come on if it's a year out, obviously, they're gonna be working on games already
3471500	3475780	No backwards compatibility whatsoever with any ps3 games
3475780	3481180	Also ps2 games it would be assumed that you know, that stuff would be coming
3481700	3487700	Via emulators on you know, the PlayStation Network since they have that right now with ps2 and PlayStation 1 games
3487700	3493540	So why would the dev kits be backwards compatible? Anyway, no, they're talking about the final product not the dev kids, right?
3493540	3498540	But how would the I mean if this is being leaked from a dev which is what I'm assuming because the dev websites out there
3498540	3503660	And everything if this is being leaked from a developer then why would their kits have the backwards compatibility?
3503660	3508220	They wouldn't have that but the thing is those they're telling them what the final specs are what their their specs are
3508380	3514300	estimated and it makes sense that they would cut out backwards compatibility because one you can still push PlayStation threes and
3514380	3519540	Two they want to sell those games, you know digitally because they can make money off that and they also don't have to put
3520100	3522100	Putting the PlayStation 2 chips in there
3522860	3528340	That wasn't too expensive because it was a couple chips putting PlayStation 3 chips in there. That's a little different
3528340	3532300	I mean, that's a whole nother console slapped into your you know system there
3532300	3535300	And emulating the PlayStation 3 I can't imagine would be
3536020	3542620	Easy at all then the final doozy, of course much like the Durango or the next Xbox ism
3542620	3544900	the lube if you will the
3545740	3551100	Rumor is that you will not be able to play used games on the system. What's gonna end up happening?
3551100	3557100	Is they're saying that this the games will be available on blu-ray disc or as a PlayStation Network download much like I guess
3557100	3558940	What the Vita is right now?
3558940	3560940	Obviously not on blu-ray disc
3560940	3565580	You will be able if you buy the disc it will be locked to a single PlayStation Network account
3565860	3567860	After which you can play the game
3567860	3574100	And save the whole thing to your hard drive or peg it as a download in your account history and download it for free
3574100	3580140	At a later date, however, much like PC games, you know, it's gonna be tied to your system. So
3581420	3583420	you know you're gonna need to
3585220	3589380	Well first off they're saying that you're in need to have a PlayStation Network account and be online
3589380	3591380	To even get the game started
3592140	3597220	And then on top of that they're saying that if you decide to trade in your disc or you know
3597220	3599220	Learn to a friend or sell it or whatever
3599540	3604940	That the next person that gets it is gonna have basically kind of a limited version of the game
3605380	3611540	either gonna be like a demo form or some sort of you know hindered version kind of think of like I
3612060	3615820	guess the online passes or something like that, but who knows to what extent and
3615820	3619500	They're gonna have to pay a fee to unlock or register the full game
3620900	3622700	so
3622700	3624700	So there's that
3624940	3631420	So I guess we can talk about that first. We talk about that. Let's talk about that. Okay, so let me
3632020	3636820	There's a few problems I have with the specs. Okay, first off. Let's talk about the
3637700	3642100	4k resolution that sounds good and all until you actually look up with 4k
3642100	3648220	Resolutions over HDMI are actually capable of 24 frames a second. That's it
3648460	3653500	So if you're looking for like 60 FPS games, you're not gonna get that on this
3653500	3657220	Also when you think about that, that's only compatible with HDMI
3657220	3662020	I think 1.4 which most TVs do not have so I mean
3662020	3666220	I would assume that there's gonna be some backwards compatibility with like 1080p and stuff like that
3666220	3670920	But let's just assume that maybe there's not okay and say they're gonna be assholes about it
3670920	3676880	Then you're gonna need to buy a new TV new sound system new cables just to get this fucking thing to work
3677880	3679520	and
3679520	3684800	Then on top of that, like I said 24 frames a second is not very I mean that's a video video
3684800	3689520	That's fine. Like watching the movie and stuff, but playing a game. I think you'd want higher
3690080	3691800	FPS for that
3691800	3693800	That's least I would think so
3694360	3697440	And then on top of that, I mean, let's see
3697440	3701320	They're talking about digital downloads for games now that works
3701480	3709040	Okay for like Vita games that are you know a couple gigs, but we're talking fucking PlayStation 4 games
3709040	3714720	I mean which are gonna be pushing these 4k graphics with textures that are fucking huge
3714720	3720520	You're talking like I mean PlayStation 3 games right now are upwards to I'd say
3720520	3725280	I mean, it's possible that they're up to 50 gigabytes on a dual layer blu-ray disc
3725280	3728400	50 gigabytes most of them don't take up 50 gigs
3728400	3732520	It's most of them are route like, you know, 10 to 20 something gigs
3732520	3737640	But still that's a fucking long time to download the game off of the internet
3737640	3742920	Plus we're talking the all these companies talking about bandwidth caps and stuff like that. You're gonna eat up your bandwidth in
3743660	3750800	No time and they want you completely connected to the internet, you know for some sort of back-ass words, you know
3750800	3755760	Anti piracy bullshit. So on top of that we're you know
3755760	3761800	We don't even need to cover why that's a bad idea because look at you know with the whole Ubisoft always on DRM bullshit
3761800	3766360	You know if their network goes down, you know PlayStation ever goes down for a day or so
3766440	3768560	Bye. Bye can't play your game system
3768560	3774280	You know for that whole day our service people overseas would not be able to relax with a PlayStation Orbis because they won't be able
3774280	3776000	To connect to the internet exactly
3776000	3781920	So I think a lot of this stuff is just kind of bullshit and and honestly they'll use game thing
3781920	3785200	I can see them still continuing on with the online passes, but I
3786640	3794680	Do not see them. I I just first off GameStop is not gonna let him do this. I mean cuz you think that
3796200	3800640	Didn't that one analyst who we always kind of tease on? Yes, Michael Patrick, but he made a good point
3800640	3803880	He said GameStop is not gonna sell these consoles
3803880	3809920	Yeah, it's basically if they're if we'll get into why that they wouldn't carry these consoles
3809920	3815760	Okay, so basically if you're you know offering a system that has no use games whatsoever
3815760	3821360	It's impossible to sell it be basically like a demo disc or something. Let's just say worst case scenario
3821360	3825680	It just you can't play anything other than a small demo on this
3826960	3829760	You know, first of all, I think that's gonna be huge
3829760	3835240	Huge huge incentive for hackers to try to fix that cuz they're gonna like oh, wait a second, you know
3835240	3839200	It's your fucking this can do whatever we want. Plus tying it to one accounts also kind of lame
3840680	3843820	But you know at the same time it's just like why
3844640	3847880	The first if they're not gonna have any use game sales or whatever
3847880	3853060	Then they're not gonna carry it in their store much like they did carry a little bit of the PSP go
3853640	3858800	Because you know some people might have wanted it but that offered really no sales for them because other than PlayStation Network cards
3858800	3863720	This is all digital. So I just don't see them doing that. But let's talk a little bit real quick
3863720	3867680	Why are you trying to say that GameStop had a hand in that? Why the PSP go failed?
3867800	3870780	No, that just it was stupid PSP go was dumb
3871120	3876760	There's a system of digital only that was priced higher than the current model out already. Why would you buy it?
3877080	3882280	Let me read some quick comments in our chat room at chat dot orange launch radio comm gamer girl says I have a feeling the ps4
3882280	3887420	Is gonna tank technus says I doubt the game will run at 4k maybe for full motion videos
3887420	3894080	But the games will probably run at 1080p at 60 frames per second. Well, yeah, remember last remember
3894080	3898960	I mean a lot of these specs could be really overblown remember back when they were talking the specs of ps3 how they're saying
3898960	3903000	Oh 1080p and 120 frames per second for all games. Yeah
3903800	3907000	And no 1080p for all games and 120 frames per second
3907000	3910240	We're just gonna go crazy with you know, that's up and that never fucking happened
3910240	3913680	I mean whatever it and it's very possible that you know
3913680	3918520	This stuff could be patched in later on because remember the original well
3918520	3921240	The Xbox 360 didn't always used to have 1080p
3921240	3926600	It was 1080 I was and then it got patched in later on so they could add it later on
3927360	3932680	It's that's possible. So it on this used game thing. Is it possible that we're
3933320	3938700	Misinterpreting a system similar to what the Vita has to prevent trophy exploitation
3938700	3943820	No possible that it's tied to an account, but you can easily remove it. I
3944740	3947580	I don't think it's like that. I think it's just because
3948700	3951620	Well, I don't know. I'm just going off what they say
3952140	3957540	Speculation but you know because they said it's just limited so and you maybe it is where you can remove it off of your system
3957540	3961260	When you're done with it, and then it becomes, you know free to use for somebody else
3961260	3966540	I would hope that that would be kind of like what it is. I I have to express big
3966540	3972300	Reservations about this and the next Xbox whatever it is if the rumors are true about that as well that
3972860	3978340	Microsoft and Sony have joined together for some sort of dark pact where both these systems are not play used games
3978340	3982440	Well, let me let me cover real quick. Okay. So first off and I got a
3983700	3989480	This is Dennis dynek and now not a lot of you may be familiar with Dennis dyack
3989480	3996260	But he's the head of developments to use at Silicon Knights, you know, Silicon Knights the company put at to human
3997660	3999660	to human
3999940	4006140	Tank, right? Okay. So this guy, you know, he is making some comments regarding used game sales
4006140	4008660	I saw because there are no used
4009940	4016060	Basically saying, you know, the the day has come and gone where you know used games should be allowed basically
4016060	4020320	You know because they're you know, he's talking about world without used games
4020320	4022840	You know and this is new consoles because there are no used games
4022840	4028060	You could actually sell a game for a long time and get reoccurring revenue for quite a while
4028360	4031440	Reoccurring revenue is very key now. There is no tail
4032200	4037880	Literally, you will get most of your sales within the three months of launch which have created this really healthy
4038440	4044920	Or literally you get most of your sales within three months of launch, which has created this really unhealthy extreme
4044920	4051360	Where you have to sell it really fast, and then you could then you have to do anything else to get money
4052040	4058760	And then also says I would argue and I've said this before that used games are cannibalizing the industry if developers and publishers
4059000	4061440	Don't see revenue from that. It's no matter
4062080	4066880	Of hey, we're trying to increase the price of games to consumers and we want more
4067200	4072840	We're just trying to survive in an industry if used games continue the way they are. It's going to cannibalize
4072840	4073880	um
4073880	4075880	There's not gonna be an industry
4076640	4078800	People won't make these kind of games
4080200	4081960	Basically saying the really high price games
4081960	4088200	So I think it's inflated the prices of games and I think the prices will have to come down if there's a longer tail
4088200	4090200	But there isn't okay. So
4090320	4095200	First off this guy's so full of bullshit me. I mean really he has nothing to go off because his games suck
4095200	4099640	It wasn't because of used games. It was because your games suck that it didn't sell but
4099640	4103920	Besides that he doesn't understand how the fucking industry works and sad
4104440	4108000	Considering a guy that is in the industry doesn't understand how it works
4108000	4112480	If you get rid of used games, you're gonna get rid of the game specialty market
4112480	4118960	Which is basically your game stops any game specific store retailers that deal in multiple things like you know
4118960	4123440	Like a Best Buy or something like that a department store that can you know carries everything?
4124040	4127240	They're not necessarily gonna be affected by that because well first off
4127240	4129880	they don't really deal and use to begin with but
4130800	4132320	They use game market
4132320	4137800	There is not a lot of margin in games new game margins are about 20% and that's from you know
4137800	4143800	The cost from the publisher itself and now well 20% may sound like a lot to everybody. They're like, well shit, you know
4144240	4150480	That's quite a markup. It's actually not in other retail markets. The market is a lot more and
4151180	4151680	Really?
4151680	4157040	They can't make you can't run a business with a 20% margin you because you're also have to pay your employees
4157040	4159040	you're renting till these and all that stuff and
4159720	4162080	It there's a lot of factors that go into it
4162080	4166160	So they make up their money by used games trade-ins and sales
4166240	4171480	Well, the trade-ins obviously are also gonna drive new game sales because you're getting people that you know
4171520	4177240	take their 2012 copy of Tiger Woods and they trade in for their 2013 copy of Tiger Woods and
4177720	4183640	You turn around and you sell the Tiger Woods or whatever game it is at, you know, an increased margin
4183640	4188580	basically, you're buying it for 20 and you're selling it for 40 and so instead of a you know,
4189580	4195120	20% margin you have like a hundred percent margin now. It's a lot healthier for these companies and now yes
4195120	4198520	I understand the game stop makes a lot of money in use but you know what?
4198520	4202740	That's how they run their business and that's how any game store is gonna run their business. They can't make
4203560	4205920	They can't survive on just new games. I
4206520	4208080	I think
4208080	4213680	Honestly, if if they're the dark pact is true and these companies are gonna move towards used games
4214360	4220400	And I think one of two things is happening aim. They just get their handing Nintendo the crown watch
4220800	4224260	Watch when those soccer moms go to the store in 2013
4224400	4229400	What system are they gonna pick up the system that they don't really have the TVs to run anyway?
4229400	4234640	And the systems where they won't be able to get used games or or that the retailer might tell them you can't play
4234640	4238620	Used games on this you can't rent and rent games of this system or they're gonna get a Wii U
4238840	4245240	They're gonna get a Wii U wake up call. Well, there's that's the same reason the Nintendo Wii succeeded the first time
4245400	4248040	There's and then well, there's a lot of people
4248760	4255260	Let me finish because if if the Wii U somehow did this too, we don't know
4256160	4259500	Nintendo could be a part of this dark pact. We don't know the final specs of the Wii U
4259500	4267220	Let's hypothesize and yes, this is being a little tinfoil Hattie, but let's hypothesize that all three game companies are taking a stand against used games
4267220	4275700	I call video game market crash of 83 all over again. It will be that serious. The video game market will crash
4277580	4281820	Absolutely will crash and they've been wondering how long is it gonna take for it to crash again?
4281860	4287540	This type of greed is going to cause it. Absolutely. I I think actually I don't think it's gonna crash
4287540	4292180	What why would I buy the system Loki but I but that's the thing though it here
4292180	4296940	Here's what I think is gonna happen is it's not necessarily gonna crash. It's just they won't buy those new systems
4297060	4300580	No one's gonna buy the new systems and then what's gonna happen?
4300580	4301020	well
4301020	4306220	there's still tons of there's still plenty of people out there with you know, the Xbox 360s and the PlayStation threes and
4306500	4308300	stuff like that, so
4308300	4313740	That's still a crash because Nintendo and Sony and Microsoft would lose so much money from putting those consoles
4313740	4319060	Well, I hope it's a big wake-up call then if that's the case and I mean at first I'm sorry
4319060	4323720	It's really just not only the used games too. I mean the fact that you know
4324220	4327140	What are these consoles really have to offer? I mean, yeah, okay
4327140	4330180	It's the technical edge, but a lot of us don't even have that technology yet
4330180	4335780	I myself did not buy a PlayStation 3 until they were already out for like two years. I just I
4336380	4342120	Really worry. I mean granted I have to take this all with a big-ass grain of salt because this is all rumors
4342120	4345560	All of it all of its rumors until it's on the show 43, right?
4345980	4351140	So maybe we're just getting a little bit carried away with the hysterics, but I hope to hell
4351700	4356080	These game companies are looking at the reaction on what they're seeing on the reddit
4356080	4360980	You know forums and and you know various internets and podcasts and so forth
4361900	4365780	We don't want this. You can't have your cake and eat it, too
4365780	4373540	You can't charge $60 for a new game and 20 bucks for all this download content and this and then block out used game sales
4373540	4376100	You can't there's a moment with especially in this economy
4376100	4383420	Which isn't gonna be fully recovered next by next year where the consumers are gonna say enough you have taken our money
4383420	4389140	We're not gonna give it to you anymore and on top of fine with our PlayStation 3s and Xbox and on top of it
4389140	4393540	They're not even really claiming that you own the disc. It's your licensing content from them
4393540	4401060	Anyways, no fucking there is no industry out there that doesn't have like used as part of it use car sales
4401380	4407120	Do we see car sales suffering because if you use car sales, no, it's never fucking happening
4407120	4409580	So why do you fucking think that you need money?
4410060	4417840	Mr. Developer of to human for use game sales. You don't deserve any of my money then that's the case
4417840	4425180	I mean, here's what how it's gonna work. Mr. Dynek or whatever our dyack. I don't even fucking pronounce your last name
4425180	4429700	Whatever Dennis dyack. Here's how it's gonna fucking work. Okay, let's cut out use game sales
4431540	4435420	$60 for your shitty game to human three or whatever for two or
4436100	4441700	more human is gonna come out and it's gonna suck balls because it's silicon Knights and
4442740	4445500	it comes out and it doesn't fucking sell and
4445500	4450040	And no one's buying it new and there's no use game market anymore
4450040	4454520	So, you know, no one's buying it and then turning it over and saying oh fuck it. I'm not gonna you know play this
4455080	4456960	So what's gonna happen your game?
4456960	4460740	your brand new game is gonna have to drop in price in order to push some sales and
4461200	4466040	It's gonna keep dropping in price until it gets it gets down to the use game price
4466040	4468040	That would have been they people are gonna buy it new
4468360	4470680	So, I mean there's no use games
4470680	4476200	People just wait till the fucking new games to get to the price of what the use games used to be before and guess what?
4476200	4481600	They get all the full, you know benefit. You can't justify a $60 game if there's no resale value
4481600	4486640	You're literally taking all of the value out of the game and and here's another fun fun fact here
4487040	4493400	Dennis dyack if your game system or the game system that you're putting your content on doesn't support use games
4494280	4500360	I'm gonna be willing to bet that companies that make their money off of use games aren't gonna fucking carry that system
4500360	4504600	So good luck pushing your product in all just Walmart's and stuff like that
4504760	4509160	You know considering that GameStop has the biggest chunk in the industry they can command
4509800	4515160	Companies to pay them for retail shelf space. I think that they have enough control to where they can say
4515360	4518560	Yeah, you're gonna not put use games on your system
4519160	4522080	Yeah, we're just not gonna carry it and they probably will listen
4522080	4526680	I mean, why would they just stop listening to them all of a sudden? I mean, come on
4526680	4531200	let me um, I know we want to wrap up this topic to move on to other things, but I want to check in with
4531200	4536360	Jamie because we haven't heard from her in a little bit and as a collector, how do you feel about no use game market?
4536360	4538360	I think that's freaking ridiculous
4538960	4546320	Cuz I mean I was just saying earlier in chat that I bought a PlayStation game two weeks ago a PlayStation game
4546640	4548640	you know, I
4548920	4552240	Still have PlayStations, you know, I'm just saying that
4552240	4557960	That there's people out there that will still keep holding on to the older systems
4557960	4562960	like say they may have an Xbox and not a 360 because all they buy is used games and
4563920	4570240	You know, that's that's their prerogative. They could do that. I think that if you take out
4571200	4573040	the ability to
4573040	4578820	Sell the game back get a little money back in their pocket so they can go out and afford to buy a new game
4578820	4585140	That they're basically gonna be cutting out. Let's just say at least a good 25% of their market
4586300	4591260	Just just in the people that basically resell games so that they can buy a new game, right?
4591260	4596620	I mean when you think about it that disc will be worth nothing by the time you take it out of the shrink wrap
4596620	4597500	It is now worth nothing
4597500	4601500	They're literally saying though that you can pop it in your system mark it as a oh
4601500	4604860	I own this and then then you can literally throw the disc away
4604860	4612860	But who has the bandwidth from Comcast or whatever your provider is to support that you get all you have a 250 gig cap?
4612860	4616540	These games are gonna be 17 gig. That's the other thing too is okay
4616540	4622060	Let's another point that I brought up because I actually responded to that article is
4623300	4626220	Okay, let's assume that you can dump this game to your hard drive
4626220	4630220	How fucking big is that hard drive gonna be and how much is it gonna fucking cost?
4630220	4636660	because you know these price the prices of these hard drives from I understand heart data storage is cheap, but
4637220	4643260	Data storage is not cheap when it's sold by a company in a proprietary format, you know, for example, you know, you could buy a
4644220	4646740	320 gigabyte hard drive or whatever from
4647420	4652680	Microsoft and it's gonna run you like 200 bucks and I can get like a 2 terabyte drive for about the same price
4652820	4655300	You know if I bought it for my PC, so
4655300	4661200	You know unless they open that shit up like they do at the ps3 props to them for that. I
4661940	4663180	Mean, why wouldn't they do that?
4663180	4668580	I mean after all these guys are so fucking hungry for money that of course they're gonna take the opportunity to you know
4668580	4673180	Oh, hey, you need that 2 terabyte drive because you're gonna have to store all those games that we're gonna make you those this
4673180	4675380	And you know, you can't take without giving back
4676700	4680820	Um, I stand by my earlier statement that this this is going to cause a video game crash
4680820	4682820	It's gonna drive the game market underground
4682820	4686860	I mean not like, you know, not like oh the back alleys or whatever
4686860	4691860	but it's gonna be it's the games will be sold at flea markets and GameStops will sell nothing but used games because
4692020	4694740	People don't want new games anymore and also not worth shit
4694740	4697960	And also when you think about you know technology getting the way it is right now
4698420	4703420	And how expensive consoles are getting you know, maybe people will actually go to PCs
4703540	4708620	Hey, look at that PCs, you know where you can get games and actually own stuff and you know
4708620	4710620	you don't have to worry about use game sales because
4710620	4713700	there's just sales on video games and
4714860	4717740	You know, there's steam and that kind of stuff
4717740	4722260	All right in the interest of time we're gonna go ahead and move on but I'm sure some of you guys have comments
4722260	4727140	We will have the skype line open a little later as always in our show and you can also send us an email mailbag
4727140	4732780	At orange lounge radio.com and if it wasn't April Fool's Day, we probably would ask a question about this on the Facebook tonight
4732780	4738860	But we did something different. So maybe next week. We'll see what you guys think about this on the show where every gamer has a voice
4738860	4746220	Meanwhile, let's talk about those hard drives because this is a disturbing rumor going around this week the rumor that
4747700	4752980	The Xbox 360 hard drives actually retained credit card information
4752980	4754460	Even if you wipe the drive
4754460	4761300	Even if you sell it back kind of that whole thing about like you have to delete from a partition seven times until the information
4761300	4767700	Is truly gone. This was a report from Drexel University that made this claim that you know
4767700	4771500	Your credit card information was not really wiped from the drive when you would sell it back
4772540	4774700	Could this be how the hacks are happening?
4775340	4780500	I'm no I say no because I've never sold a hard drive back and I was hacked and have all my drives
4780500	4784800	I've ever had and on top of that. I don't think it stores the actual credit card information on your hard drive
4784800	4791540	It's it's tied to your network account or your Xbox Live account and it's downloaded from there, but is it possible?
4791540	4793540	It's ever written it to the drive ever
4793540	4800260	It's possible that it might be in a cache file or something like that. Maybe maybe that is possible
4800260	4806900	But now Microsoft responded to the whole thing. So let me read Microsoft's response because obviously this is important quote
4806900	4809820	We are conducting a thorough investigation into the researchers claims
4809820	4816860	We have requested information that will allow us to investigate the console in question and have still not received the information needed to replicate the researchers
4816860	4821140	Claims so they're deflecting a little bit in the opening like we don't have the information yet
4821140	4826460	Xbox is not designed to store credit card data locally on the console and
4826580	4830940	As such seems unlikely credit card data was recovered by the method described
4831640	4838820	Additionally when Microsoft refurbishes used consoles, we have processes in place to wipe the local hard drives of any other user data
4838980	4844260	We can assure Xbox owners. We take the privacy and security of their personal data very seriously
4844260	4849360	I somehow doubt that they actually wipe the drive with like zero byte writing, but I think it's just like
4849360	4856120	Format that was not a 100% denial either. Did you notice that that was not a firm?
4856120	4863560	No, this is crap. That was a we haven't been able to investigate it and it's unlikely but that wasn't a no. I
4868040	4872640	Mean maybe for legal reasons they can't say no because if they do say no and it ends up they were wrong
4872640	4879200	Now we can class-action lawsuit them Xbox live agreement be damned because this is on the actual hardware itself
4880680	4884620	Right. So is that why they have to be vague with the language? That's my assumption
4886280	4891120	It's with any business you have to basically cover room to see why a
4892800	4898840	Still very scary a very scary report and I'm not scared God. I I
4898840	4904520	I know I'm a total hypocrite saying this because my credit card info is on my xbox, but
4905520	4907600	If you haven't put it on there yet
4907600	4912600	I would advise you just don't don't ever give those damn things your credit card use the cards that you buy in stores
4912680	4914680	It's the only safe way to do it
4915320	4919400	Sad, but true. All right. Meanwhile dark soccer. What do you got for us?
4921760	4927880	Well, actually I was answering a question from niche I guess mm-hmm asking what my favorite console is of all time
4927880	4932240	From our chat room. Yeah. Yeah, I'd probably say the PC Engine duo
4932880	4934800	Turbo duo. Why is that?
4934800	4936800	Dracula X
4936940	4940640	Super Nintendo for me easy Super Nintendo was the best console they ever did I think
4941560	4943300	so anyway, um
4943300	4949760	You remember we'd actually mentioned a rumor about zipper being closed zipper interactive that created
4949760	4953400	So calm the developer so it was last week. Yeah. Well, I'm Sony confirmed it
4953400	4961160	they said they said that it was a result of a normal cycle of resource realignment and
4962360	4964360	Basically, like they did their shit. We're done
4965040	4966960	said pretty much like
4966960	4968800	they said that
4968800	4972160	They completed work on unit 13 and now they're done and that
4972600	4978320	They're still gonna be support for mag. So come for in unit 13 and there will be new daily challenges on unit 13
4978320	4985000	But other than that, bye. Bye. Well, I mean
4985000	4991920	I guess most of us kind of assumed last week's was probably true anyway, but it's unfortunate that it was confirmed, but
4992840	4998440	It doesn't when you say a rumor, you should always give us some closure. Sure. Yeah, they got the closure
4998440	5000440	All right, if it's true
5000440	5007360	That these new consoles are gonna lock out use games. I bet this this is gonna get a lot more frequent. It's gonna be
5008200	5012760	If your company doesn't develop for PC, you're gonna be in trouble. That's all I have to say. Oh
5013600	5017520	Wonder what the project was though that was cancelled so calm five
5018200	5020200	maybe maybe
5020200	5023560	Just so calm on the Vita. Who knows? Yeah, probably
5023960	5028120	Alright, let's travel around the world and check out some release dates and what is coming out near you soon
5028120	5031200	Oh, well, the drought has begun again
5031200	5036400	So not a whole lot this week Titanic mystery on Nintendo DS and on the Wii
5037200	5040440	To celebrate the release of the movie all over again
5041080	5046120	It's talking about the Titanic 2 and now it there's a bomb on Titanic. I think we talked about this now
5046120	5048840	Yeah, it sounds like the plot of speed 2
5049960	5051960	There's also of course
5052360	5054880	funky barn from Ubisoft
5056080	5057720	3ds game
5057720	5063000	Fallout and oblivion are getting a double pack on Xbox 360 and PC
5064320	5070160	Connect Star Wars out this week as well as the Kinect Star Wars limited-edition Kinect Star Wars. Oh, that's finally out bundle
5070160	5072680	Yes, I'll be damned next ours is finally out

5081840	5083840	and
5083840	5085840	And
5085960	5089680	That's it finally Xenoblade Chronicles, that's when a lot of people are looking forward to
5090360	5092760	Yeah, gotta gotta say that. Oh and I did
5093760	5097780	Originally, it was gonna be a double may cry HD collection this week on ps3 and 360
5097780	5105920	However, Capcom dropped the street date on that so it just it's out now like canceled or just they they're no longer street dating it
5105920	5109520	So it was basically before it was okay. You have to hold your copies until Tuesday
5109520	5115720	They're like, I just sell it. Maybe it got leaked or something. Who knows. I don't yeah, it got leaked years ago
5115760	5119000	Devils may cry HD edition. It's not like one of those games like people have to have right now
5119000	5126600	It's like you already played it before you can and look all that HD there. Hmm. Just saying. All right, let's go to Japan in Japan
5127400	5131080	Not a whole lot coming out, but there are a few things on the Nintendo 3ds
5131600	5133200	Puyo Puyo
5133200	5139920	Kansatsu Nikki that is not Puyo Puyo. It's big difference Puyo Puyo, which looks like this big fat cat. Yeah
5139960	5145520	But it's not really Nintendogs or Nintendcats. Although I guess it does actually look a little similar to that
5145520	5148140	I've seen that cat a bunch of places before so
5148440	5152560	It's like from a manga like a character or something. Actually. It does look a lot like Nintendogs or
5153200	5155200	Looks like Shermie
5155920	5157200	Shermie
5157200	5159200	Shermie is not that fat
5159200	5163240	And she's not orange a plus. All right going to
5164000	5168000	Let's check out the Vita. See what's coming out on the Vita this week over in Japan

5227600	5230040	That's the sound the eyes make mahjong
5233320	5237480	How about the UK dar soccer on the third we have Star Wars connect

5249700	5253620	Many robots shoot them. Yep. All right. All right
5253940	5259260	Well, we're gonna take a moment to go in the gaming archive and find a game the dark soccer things
5259260	5261620	Hey, you ungrateful little brats
5263260	5267620	Although tonight we were reminiscing about old times a little bit. So everybody was reminiscing tonight a bit
5267620	5270200	But we're gonna reminisce again not with an old version of our show
5270200	5272200	With a classic game of the week
5273120	5278960	Dark soccer. What did you pick from the archives this week is the classic game of the week Street Fighter and that's no joke
5279840	5285160	Although the truth, although Capcom fighting games have become a bit of a joke in recent years
5285720	5290680	Well, I figured with everything happening. I may as well just go right to the source. Let's talk about Street Fighter
5293000	5298960	So, yeah, it came out in 1987, of course by Capcom and it was their first
5298960	5301760	fighting game that they put out and
5303800	5305120	It
5305120	5311640	Had it was actually one of the first ones that had a six button controller and had commands that had special moves
5312040	5314760	So this basically started the whole big thing for us
5316240	5324040	The version that came out on the turbo graphics CD was called fighting street in 1988 and that actually came out on the virtual console
5324640	5326640	in November 2009 and
5326640	5327960	the
5327960	5329960	same for UK
5331280	5333120	So basically the
5333120	5340700	You have one-on-one matches against the computer opponent and then each matches three rounds and you have to defeat each
5341080	5346160	Opponent in less than 30 seconds if the match ends before the fighter is knocked out
5346160	5353440	Then they will get whoever has the most energy will you know, make it to the next round basically the way fighting games do today
5353440	5359560	You have to win two rounds to win and move forward and if the third round is a tie then
5359960	5361960	The computer wins by default
5363880	5371520	So, I mean basically this started the whole thing this you know having the moves and everything having
5373760	5380000	Also started the computer cheating every time because that's bullshit that if it's still a tie that's not just win
5380000	5383120	Well, yeah, but actually that case that's actually somebody playing for you. So
5386120	5393440	There were there was a deluxe version of the game that had an 8-way joystick and then two large
5394040	5396040	mechatronic pads for punches and kicks
5396360	5398160	So it was basically
5398160	5404840	The harder you hit the harder your punch or your kick was and then the later version came out with the six attack buttons
5404840	5410680	You know the three heavy punches and three of the three punches and the three kicks so
5412920	5417320	There were all kinds of you know, the different moves basically you had
5419200	5424240	The psycho fire which was the hadoken and the dragon punch and a hurricane kick I mean
5425360	5428320	It they were all the same moves that followed over
5429840	5431840	So for the characters in this one
5431840	5434600	um, basically you play as Ryu and
5435320	5439200	If you have a second player then you play as Ken. That's why they had the same
5441120	5442720	And
5442720	5448600	He also, you know, basically the two-player mode is basically versus Ken
5450160	5452160	So you had different
5452360	5453920	opponents in
5453920	5459280	Single-player mode you had Retsu who was a Kenpo instructor
5459280	5462000	gecky who had a claw and
5463480	5465280	Joe who was a
5465280	5469480	Another karate guide Mike who from what I understand became Mike
5469480	5475720	I think was actually if I'm right he became Mike bison in Street Fighter 2 which as
5476240	5478800	We know over here. He was called Balrog
5479440	5481440	which was
5481720	5487080	Vegas name and Vega was who was bison over here and I've gone across side
5487080	5488680	Yeah
5488680	5490280	Yeah, that's how it worked
5490280	5492840	So we had a Lee who was
5493400	5500640	Chinese boxing and Gen who was a professional killer and Gen came back in Street Fighter alpha or Street Fighter zero
5501440	5503120	and so did birdie
5503120	5509960	who was the wrestler slash boxer he also was in there and then there was one named Eagle who was a bodyguard and
5511160	5513160	then you had your
5513160	5520920	Your last two opponents you had a Don who was Muay Thai and he actually came back for Street Fighter alpha as well
5521320	5526660	He was the one with the very interesting here and Sagat who was the boss and now
5531000	5534120	So it came out it was
5534760	5540200	Produced by Takashi Nishiyama who we've seen as piston Takashi
5540200	5542200	I
5546600	5550640	Was just looking at that because the other video ran out so I went and looked at some other matches
5551200	5556960	It was also um it was planned by um Hiroshi Matsumoto and the two of them actually went on
5557400	5562240	to do a bunch of games for SNK including fatal fury and art of fighting and
5563400	5565880	Then they came back to work on Street Fighter 4
5565880	5570360	So uh and we all know Imani occasion, right?
5573440	5577600	Basically he also designed the character portraits in Street Fighter and
5580000	5584280	So we've got like I said there were two different versions in the arcade there was the regular version
5585200	5588800	That has a six button and the deluxe one that had the pressure sensitive pads
5589120	5591880	So you can basically hit pad here as hard as the pad did
5591880	5597320	Basically in the US version well, I'd say in the any non-japanese version I should say
5598040	5604280	Ken and Ryu were dubbed in English so that their moves were like Psycho, Fire, Dragon Punch and Hurricane Kick and
5604920	5607640	Then later versions just left the voices in Japanese
5608680	5613320	So you know basically when you get into Street Fighter 4 it actually has both versions of it
5616040	5618360	So yeah the home versions there was like I said earlier
5618360	5622120	Fighting Street for the TurboGrafx that had an arranged soundtrack and
5624680	5630440	The this was interesting too the because it didn't have a six button controller your
5631480	5638120	Strength of your moves were determined by how long you held the subsequent kick or punch button because it just had like
5639000	5642280	They later did six button controllers though when it's a for TurboGrafx
5642280	5650200	But anyway, did you know Rob that there was a Commodore 64 version?
5651240	5656120	Actually, I did isn't that sad, but yes, I didn't know about the Commodore 64 version. I think I had it
5656960	5663560	Well, um there was also one from the X Spectrum. It didn't play that great by the way because the Commodore 64 only has one button
5664080	5668760	this MS-DOS Amiga and Atari ST that came out by US Gold and
5668760	5670760	And
5671080	5673080	They were
5673160	5680960	I believe published by Tiertex, and they said that they actually came out with their with an unofficial sequel called human killing machine
5682960	5691260	Kind of interesting huh of course of US Gold also was the one that published by my commando in 1943 so now
5695160	5697160	The
5697160	5701240	I mean it was as far as this. I mean it was considered to be
5702400	5706960	one of the games of the year as stated by Sinclair user and
5708800	5712800	C plus VG said it had no lasting appeal whatsoever
5714600	5715960	Well
5715960	5721200	How did that last lucky that somebody felt differently and gave it a sequel? Huh seriously?
5722480	5725800	But I mean the sequel is so much better though. I mean it
5725800	5726840	is
5726840	5731200	Yeah, yeah, but I mean so we can see the roots of it. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, absolutely
5731920	5738480	And I mean there is an emulation of the arcade version that's available in Capcom arcade hits volume one
5738680	5744980	but also of course a Street Fighter 2 champion edition and that's available for a Windows PC and the
5745200	5751880	Capcom classics collection remix for PSP and Capcom classics volume 2 for ps2 and Xbox
5751880	5753880	All
5754160	5759160	Right that it that's it your classic game of the week Street Fighter or
5760480	5762880	Fighting Street, I guess right depending on where you are
5763720	5767920	For a variety of systems doing nothing apparently, but shorty you can over
5769480	5776120	All right, we're going to move right into some rapid-fire news tonight if things seem a little bit compressed
5776120	5780880	That's because we compressed our regular show because the April Fool's thing we did at the beginning so yes
5780880	5785480	It is moving at a different pace tonight, so let's just go right into rapid-fire news Loki
5786000	5787560	All right
5787560	5789560	Let's talk a little bit about
5790120	5792920	Some Easter eggs, and this is kind of funny
5793540	5799440	There was actually an Easter egg that was found on the Nintendo 64 version of Goldeneye
5799720	5804560	It was actually an emulator for the ZX spectrum
5805040	5808420	Complete with ten games, and it was on that cartridge of course
5808420	5812500	you know it was something that was kind of locked out a little bit, but
5813100	5820220	Thanks to a patch if you are running it in an emulator. You can actually access all ten of those games and
5821020	5825480	That's kind of neat that they did that apparently the company well rare
5827140	5832220	They had also I guess developed games for the ZX spectrum
5832220	5837940	Back in the day, so that's kind of interesting that that was on there
5840140	5846940	And then this is kind of disappointing news Kid Icarus uprising actually began as a Wii game
5847420	5850700	And it was being developed on PC as well
5850900	5855540	I imagined the dev kits or PCs, but as a Wii game. I yes exactly
5855540	5857820	I kind of think it should have stayed a Wii game, too
5857820	5858100	Yeah
5858100	5862700	It would have been fucking awesome as a Wii game not the saying that they couldn't bring it the consoles later on
5862700	5868220	But it would have been fucking awesome as a Wii game not so now that I'm playing it and thinking about the controls, too
5868220	5871420	Like I can see how it totally was a Wii game
5871420	5876180	And it would have been because you could use the little thumb stick to move and you aim at the TV
5876340	5879380	Like it actually makes a lot more sense as a Wii game
5880380	5883740	Although the 3d the 3d is beautiful in it though. I mean it is
5884380	5886580	Here's the thing here's the thing that's really disappointing though
5886580	5890980	They actually have video from the game running on the Wii version
5892580	5897820	It's gorgeous it still looks oh wow I didn't see the video. That's awesome. Yeah, it's just
5898580	5903500	Is it on the story here? It's on the story. Yeah, they actually show it looks like I mean
5903500	5909020	It's basically what you see in the 3ds version. Just minus any enemies and stuff like that, but I mean
5909820	5912620	I've been an awesome. This is the first level
5912620	5917500	This is this looks like it could just be the screen from the 3ds one, but
5918220	5922380	But yeah, that's the dev the prototype version that they had all right. I mean
5923820	5928340	So sad that it could have been you know they should still do it as a PC game
5929060	5932860	We're still time to put it out as a Wii game. That's right. Yeah, that's true. You are we you
5933740	5935740	You never know
5936260	5938260	So yeah
5938260	5945220	This point very disappointing less disappointing is the success of journey, which is a PlayStation Network game?
5945220	5947680	I really didn't talk enough about because it came out at the time
5947680	5952860	I was getting back into Mass Effect, but this is a great experience on the PlayStation 3 and and again
5952860	5955260	I really suggest you guys check it out however
5955260	5960780	It sounds like a lot of you already have a journey is now the fastest selling Sony Computer Entertainment
5961180	5965540	America region PSN game in all of recorded history so check that out
5965540	5970180	the honor before that was infamous to festival of blood so
5971420	5978700	Anyhow, so journey has been doing very very very well online and April 10th is when the soundtrack is coming out
5978700	5982380	You can get that either on the PlayStation Store, or you can do it in iTunes
5982620	5986480	So that's gonna be coming on April 10th, and it does have a gorgeous soundtrack with it, too
5986480	5990660	So again journey on PlayStation Network is it's it's trip
5990660	5996500	I like it a lot and the end they're gonna be doing a little big planet stuff for journey as well
5996500	5999580	So I did read about someone needs to get it for me
6001180	6004060	Maybe for your birthday, maybe all right
6004580	6011060	If PC games are more your thing audio surf especially if you like music games is probably one that you've checked out before
6011620	6013580	Well guess what they're not gonna stop there
6013580	6016700	There's a website for a little something called audio surf air
6016700	6022400	air who knows what that is it could be a mobile version of the game, but it sounds like it's more likely a
6022640	6028600	Sequel to the original audio surf there is some screenshots on the website of course everything is subject to change
6028940	6033280	But it does look like I don't know the the little machine looks a little more like a boat or something now
6033280	6035360	So it is definitely possible. They've changed some things up
6035560	6040560	I think they are recruiting for beta signups right now, so you can check that out on their website, which is
6041160	6045760	It's air dot audio dash surf calm air that
6045760	6053580	Down there air dot audio dash surf calm. That's a lot of punctuation. So there you go audio surf air dark Sarah
6054360	6057240	Well in other news Rob
6058160	6062560	Playing with your me game. I got a swap note. I had to check it. It's a cat
6063200	6068640	No, well I said I sent a swap note earlier, so and it's my little April Fool's joke now
6068640	6070640	Did you get the one from Reggie I?
6070640	6076480	I did get the one from Reggie, and you can use him as a level 5 guy in find me or whatever
6076480	6078280	But he got scared off by the monster
6078280	6083760	And I didn't get to use him at all and that pissed me the fucking asshole. I know right so news I
6084520	6086520	Had to give you a hard time Rob
6086520	6089200	Mortal Kombat Vita has a release date. It's
6090400	6093760	going to be coming out in Europe on May 4th and
6093760	6100120	And I don't see what the American data us is May 1st first right yeah, yeah
6100400	6108980	So basically it's gonna have touchscreen enabled fatalities and a challenge tower whoo and a hundred and fifty Vita exclusive missions
6110320	6115080	The Vita challenge tower could be neat. I mean they're gonna incorporate a lot of the Vita stuff into it, so
6116520	6119200	I'm interested, but I don't really want to pay 40 bucks or whatever
6119200	6123240	It's gonna cost to play it new when I already have the old one. You know exactly well
6123240	6127920	There's another game and really I'm only reporting on this because I like the name of it awesome not
6130120	6133080	It's a multiplayer arena beat-em-up
6133080	6139100	That's going to be on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live arcade on May 2nd put out by Ronimo games
6139560	6146120	so you basically beat people up in teams of three online or via splits screen locally and
6147320	6149320	There's no price tag on it yet
6149320	6156240	It's a Ronimo is a Dutch developer nice. They put out a swords and soldiers
6157480	6159000	alrighty
6159000	6162920	We're gonna get into the frugal question of the week actually though. I think I want to do an
6163480	6166800	Unscripted break just because the recording is starting to get a little long
6166880	6170320	So I need to save the recording so we don't lose it so I get the temp space back
6170360	6173920	So we're gonna do a little technical break and when we come back
6173920	6175740	I'm gonna do just a two-minute song here when we come back
6175740	6179640	We will do more of orange launch radio including the frugal question of the week F use of the week
6180160	6185480	Twitter topics at twitter.com slash olr and your phone calls at one eight seven seven game
6185480	6189380	Oh, LR will get to those right after a quick impromptu break here
6195780	6200080	Welcome back everybody to orange lounge radio on this April Fool's Day edition
6200600	6202500	episode number 452 of our show
6202500	6205800	And if you tuned in late tonight you list missed a little bit of retro
6205800	6209120	Oh, LR at the top of the show so check it out when it hits the podcast feed yes
6209120	6211360	It will all be in the somebody was asking if they could get a recording of
6211640	6214820	The beginning of the show tonight, and I was like it it'll be in the podcast
6214920	6221520	So it'll be all there songs and all because we very intentionally pick songs that were from the games themselves
6221520	6224320	So they're like licensed a little differently so we can
6224520	6229620	Probably get away with putting those in the podcast a little easier than if we had done some of the licensed DDR music
6229620	6235040	I don't know Konami might not like the fact that you put the unedited version of dynamite Raven there
6235040	6238040	You know the one that was actually good enough the newer one that they
6238480	6243040	Felt that they need to go and tweak kind of like George Lucas tweaks his movie
6243040	6246200	Hey, we were helping to promote dancing stage featuring Lady Gaga, so
6246960	6252160	How can they be mad all right anyhow? Let's get back into the show?
6252160	6261000	A frugal question of the week, it's where we ask you guys a question on Facebook and Google plus, and we call it frugal all
6265200	6271080	Right so nope no bites on Google this week, which has me convinced nobody is on Google plus however to be fair
6271080	6277060	I kind of forgot about the segment till a few hours before the show so I will try to remember to post these on Saturday
6277060	6279060	So you have a full day to answer the question?
6279060	6283420	Whether it be on Google plus if you'd search for orange lounge radio
6283420	6289800	I also also I should say this I saw a commercial for Google plus at the movies yesterday before Hunger Games
6289800	6293940	they're really trying they're trying to get people to make the switch to Google plus and
6294620	6299540	Since I'm being forced to move to this stupid timeline thing on Facebook
6299540	6304760	I like it Google plus doesn't seem so bad and our page is now the timeline you can get in
6304760	6309400	Oh for that by the way. I think I will I hate the way time looks I hate it. I hate the left
6309400	6311400	And the right side stuff. It's I love it
6312200	6313720	Well, I hate it
6313720	6315940	All right here. It is the frugal question of the week
6316460	6323760	What is your favorite urban legend or April Fool's joke in the gaming community that turned out to be fake or perhaps even real?
6323760	6328680	Years later for example, Shang Long Sonic and Super Smash Brothers melee and so forth
6329280	6331280	Be sure to sign your comments. Oh
6331280	6334520	Obviously if you wrote on Facebook, then you already did
6335960	6342520	Dark Tetsuya writes, honestly, I don't think anything could top Shang Long from EGM April 92
6342520	6344520	Wow, even quoted the magazine in the date
6344960	6350120	Keep in mind that this was even before we had the internet much less as big as it is today
6350120	6356200	And you have to give the editors credit for sticking the find the AFD joke contest right underneath it
6356200	6359680	I agree that was a pretty epic troll on behalf of that magazine
6359680	6364260	I remember they used to do these epic April Fool's jokes every year, and they've kind of set the benchmark
6364480	6368000	But I loved when their jokes would become realities like Ermac in
6368280	6373120	Mortal Kombat 1 like ended up being a really real thing that was kind of funny, so
6374040	6381640	Alright, Cody T. Writes us and says one that happened just recently Assassin's Creed connect, and there's a video trailer for it and everything
6381640	6387360	It's actually pretty hilarious, and he linked us to the video trailer there, so yeah, I didn't see this I watched it
6387360	6392480	And it's you know looks like the normal connect videos, and you see this guy do like this backflip
6392800	6399260	You know in in his living room and stuff, and it just it just gets more and more ridiculous
6400080	6406840	Pork Chop writes and says how about the Final Fantasy 7 tech demo for PlayStation 3 that had everybody lose their minds and assume there'd
6406840	6411800	Be a remake ultimate fanboy troll well to be fair that wasn't an April Fool's joke
6411800	6417160	But I get we did say urban legend or April Fool's joke, so that was a huge troll on
6418000	6423240	Somebody's part you have to wonder if they didn't consider. Can I add mine in here sure of course yeah?
6423240	6425240	You get to answer to remember when they were
6425560	6427680	Going to do Megaman Legends 3
6427680	6431960	And then they said they're gonna put out a demo for it and that you'd have to pay for the demo
6431960	6437200	And then they said fuck you we're not gonna do it. Haha. Yeah, that was that wasn't a troll
6437200	6439700	That was just fucking mean is what that was
6439700	6447680	Which by the way, and I do follow them on Facebook still you know 10,000 or 100,000 strong for Megaman Legends
6448060	6451500	3 to return or whatever that is they're up to 80,000
6451940	6457020	Likes so that's more than a million moms right yeah, so I mean
6458540	6461180	You know hey if you haven't liked them yet, maybe you should
6463460	6466820	This just in there are more Megaman fans than moms
6466820	6470420	Apparently go figure all right moving on I
6471060	6472500	Kid I kid
6472500	6476240	Tyler M says Goken in Street Fighter 2 I don't remember that one
6476240	6481160	I do cuz that was it was supposed to be Ryu and Ken's teacher, and now he's in Street Fighter 4
6481160	6486260	Oh, how funny I forgot that one that must have been a little later after the Shang Long ordeal
6486980	6491620	Phil G. Writes, I'm still not convinced the Diablo 3 release date is real
6491980	6495820	That's a very valid concern sir, but we have people who are already playing the beta
6495820	6501060	I mean the beta has been out for a while now though. Oh, yeah, I mean so it's got to be sometime soon
6501060	6503460	Well, you know that it was practically done in October
6503980	6509540	Well, yes, you know there are some people are concerned that the Gran Turismo 5 release date isn't accurate either
6511260	6519420	Also a legitimate concern yes, um let's see unfolded raptor writes and says when I was in third grade back in 2000 I
6519420	6524700	I feel so old
6530620	6535440	That was it that was a great troll from unfolded raptor right there good job, sir all right I
6536100	6541440	Used to tell my friend at school that if he threw flares in the corner of a certain room in Tomb Raider the last
6541620	6544660	Revelation that it would skip him to the end of the game well
6544660	6549620	He kept doing that and it ticked him off that he had to restart the level again and again and waste his flares
6549820	6554700	So he comes back and tells me the next day that if I went through the whole game of Star Fox 64
6554900	6559660	Without doing a barrel roll that at the end and Ross would come out and shake his butt I
6562580	6564900	Have to remember there in third grade, so this is funny
6564900	6569900	I played Star Fox 64 over and over for about a week before I was convinced that no such thing existed
6569900	6575620	Years later my friend told me he lied about and Ross and it served me right, but deep down in my heart
6575620	6583460	I want to believe that such a secret ending actually exists. This is an April Fool's prank that is stuck with me throughout the years I
6585180	6592020	Feel like this needs an animated gif file of and Ross shaking his butt with I want to believe
6592020	6595020	That's
6597180	6601540	A good story what I like about that story is it really has nothing to do with gaming magazines or press
6601540	6606300	But it's just like people trolling each other, and that's that's great all right lastly Hunter are rights
6606300	6611740	It says I remember last year this game that claimed to be Duke Nukem forever came out except
6611740	6616380	It was totally lame there are people who are still convinced that shit is real ha ha I
6616380	6623060	See what you did there. I see what you did there all right. That's it for our frugal question
6623060	6626980	It's even funnier. There's developers that think that the critics went too hard on them
6632820	6635820	By the way those are like those are like the 9-eleven conspiracy
6635820	6640660	There's thousand strong for bringing back Mega Man Legends 3 they're up to eighty one thousand six hundred forty two
6640660	6642660	Yeah, that's actually been going up quite a bit
6642660	6647700	So they keep that up you may be able to hit that before June
6647700	6650940	I I would go like the page, but I'm over it
6652740	6654740	That's just where I'm at. I'm over it
6655100	6657260	All right, let's get back into some more news Loki
6657780	6664740	All right, well unfortunately something that may not be coming back quite as soon as Mega Man Legends 3
6667060	6669520	To PSP games which
6670220	6671660	had
6671660	6676580	Problems with their save files or you know that they could be exploited to launch
6677220	6679220	homebrew emulator on
6679420	6682740	the PlayStation Vita basically through the PSP
6683620	6686100	Emulation or the emulator on there
6687420	6692780	And allow them to run unsigned code so before we knew about motorstorm
6692780	6699940	Arctic rift that was taken off and now hotshots tennis or everybody's tennis in Europe has also been taken down
6699940	6704300	Because it was also being used in exploits to run
6705380	6707380	homebrew on the Vita
6707620	6708780	so
6708780	6713900	That's what happens is these people release. You know a method that requires one of these games and
6715220	6716620	Then it goes away
6716620	6719540	What they should do is tell people to buy those games first
6719620	6723480	And then release the exploit so that people have a chance to actually use it
6723480	6730120	Of course it's only a matter of time before they patch this out, and then you know now what's interesting about this again
6730120	6736400	These are PlayStation P portable games that are allowing the PlayStation Vita to be hacked
6736400	6739920	I found that to be interesting, but they were using the old games to do it
6739920	6741440	It's only hacked within the emulator
6741440	6746440	But the emulator isn't as strapped as it was on the PSP you can still do a little bit more
6746440	6748720	You have a little bit more memory and stuff to work with
6749000	6753200	But it's still within the emulator you don't actually have access to the whole vita stuff yet
6753200	6755320	But it allowed you to install Linux on the Vita
6755320	6763440	I would allow you to run the emulators, and maybe isos. I don't know about that, but at least emulators
6765080	6771800	And those are surprised you didn't get in on this before it got shut down. I don't download PSP games
6773360	6776600	You know other than the ones I got for free so and honestly
6776600	6781360	I'm kind of over playing emulators on stuff right now. I mean if I want to play emulators
6781360	6783800	I have my PSP still I have
6784600	6787600	Fuck I have a dingoo that only plays emulators
6788440	6794360	I mean, I don't really need another system to run. You know homebrew stuff on right now
6794920	6798880	All right, well this is one game that you may not ever get to play again
6799440	6802920	After this whole well no it sounds like not a lot of people played it in the first place
6803080	6807900	But now there's a big lawsuit going on you remember Def Jam rap star. Oh, God
6807900	6813100	Well, here's the thing about it though try not to as well you guys as silly of a game as it looked
6813100	6814620	This is the thing it wasn't that bad
6814620	6820100	It was actually a pretty slick music game like I know a lot of had a really cool community feature to it like the whole
6820100	6823940	YouTube sharing stuff like I know there's a lot of people that are like I'm not into rap music
6823940	6828580	But if you actually kind of look at the way this game was built and everything it actually was a pretty solid music game
6828580	6833620	I have to say but because it is you know it's it's a specific audience
6833620	6838860	You know some people aren't into rap they'd rather have a rock game or something so because you know it was an audience
6839420	6845900	That had to be in the rap and not everybody wants to like rap in their own house or whatever it didn't really do too
6845900	6846980	well
6846980	6851300	Unfortunately it you know it went came and went real quick, but here's the weird thing
6851340	6854220	There's a lawsuit going on right now for big money
6854900	6858500	EMI is suing for millimeter games and terminal reality
6858500	6863300	Saying that songs were used in the game that they weren't entitled to
6864180	6870340	Rap star apparently got some songs from labels like Def Jam and so forth EMI says though it owned small
6870500	6876620	percentages of other tracks that were nominally owned by other labels some of the weird yeah
6876620	6880300	I know right some of the examples include DJ Khalid's. I'm so hood
6880300	6889820	Lil Wayne's got money, which EMI said they own 10% of one of them and 30% of the other I know right but apparently
6890820	6893380	This is me that multiple publishers
6893380	6899060	You know the way these things get bought and who finances it and so forth I can kind of see where this happens
6899060	6904480	But EMI says 54 tracks infringe on their rights. They're going after eight million dollars in damages
6904480	6911880	But the weird thing to me is that this game is a few years old now. I think it's 2010
6911880	6917400	Yeah, or nine. I don't know how ice it was that same e3 was October
6918280	6919560	It was in October
6919560	6924200	I remember seeing it at e3 and I want to say it was the same year that game room had come out so what year
6924200	6927640	Was game room was that 2009? I think was 2009
6928960	6930960	So yeah
6930960	6933800	Interesting it was
6937400	6940560	2010 actually really all right 2010 and
6943440	6948080	Yeah, and they shut down the community site in 2011 don't
6949320	6953240	All right, let's move on to the mailbag every week you guys send us emails
6954440	6960000	Mail bag at orange long trader calm dark soccer is gonna dive in head first to pick a few of her favorite emails and read
6960000	6960960	them now
6960960	6962400	Okay, Kermit
6962400	6965520	He's something vaguely Kermit. Hi whoa Kermit the frog here
6966200	6967920	Okay
6967920	6970560	This one comes from pikaruna. You know that's long
6973400	6975400	Something stuck my cheek
6975400	6978640	Hey guys glad to hear on last week's show that epic Mickey will be getting a sequel
6979400	6981400	Although I have a day
6981960	6985560	Although I haven't played the original yet the concepts always attracted me. I'm sure Rob knows why
6985560	6990240	And it'll be good to see the game on a console that I regularly play
6990240	6990920	I
6990920	6994920	Remember you made some comments about how epic Mickey was meant to be this dark more adult game
6994920	6997200	And how it didn't really live up to that promise and it got me thinking
6997880	6999360	There is one branch of Disney
6999360	7002000	I'd like to see handle a project like this and that would be Disney Italy
7002320	7009640	They've always had free artistic reign producing tons of exclusive comics and characters that never really gained traction elsewhere
7010200	7015160	At the end of the 90s Disney Italy decided to launch a couple of experiments unsuccessful some less
7015160	7022320	So but all quite surprising these included pkna a Marvel slash DC style comic and featuring paper
7022920	7030120	Paper-y Nick Donald Duck superhero alter ego as he fought aliens time travelers and mutants featured violence and actual character deaths
7030760	7034320	The most successful the experiments this even got its own video game
7034320	7039040	Although that was based on the shitty third series that fans like to forget ever happened
7039400	7044880	Can I say real quick the whole epic Mickey thing? I it's nowhere else in our show row
7044880	7049360	I don't think we've covered it here. There's that awesome new I don't know if you heard but with epic Mickey 2
7049400	7052280	They're also doing the 3ds game
7052280	7057240	Well, the 3ds isn't a port of epic Mickey to the 3ds game is a new casual of illusion game
7057240	7060160	Oh, right, and they're doing like stages like
7060820	7066040	Classic stages, but they're doing stuff like Tangled and you know, it's a bunch of new Disney movies in it, too
7066040	7068040	It's cool. I'm like sold
7068080	7069880	Thank you very much
7069880	7071880	Sounds better than the console one to me
7071880	7075440	Okay, well to continue. Yes, ma'am
7075520	7080720	There's witch a shoujo manga style comic this one also ran for quite a long time
7080720	7086200	Also getting its own TV show and being turned into a real manga in Japan not to be confused with Winx Club
7086200	7088200	Which was a cheap and nasty knockoff of this
7089640	7095500	Riddhi Topolino, which is what you get when you cross Disney with Monty Python short-lived but hilarious things
7095640	7098520	They did include publishing their Christmas issue in July
7098520	7105640	And certain deliberate mistakes into the comic strip and one memorable feature celebrated the Olympics by having Mickey compete against a garden gnome
7106320	7109880	The inanimate gnome not only one but the end of many also dumps Mickey for it
7110720	7117960	There's Mickey Mouse mystery magazine the darkest of the bunch Mickey is a hard-boiled detective in his own noir comic solving mysteries and dealing with bad
7117960	7120200	Guys, this was so dark
7120200	7125840	later issues tried to soften the story by making it look like Mickey was just watching the episode as a film rather than him being
7125840	7127480	the actual protagonist
7127480	7130320	Then in early 2000s Disney Italy got a new director
7130320	7135000	They decided all this awesome teen oriented stuff was too bold and basically killed off every one of these projects
7135000	7137560	Which is a great shame. They all deserved a lot more recognition
7138520	7142040	Unfortunately PKNA and MMMM never made it to the States
7142240	7148240	So your only chance of reading these fine series is to learn Italian or look for fan translated scans on the net
7148240	7152000	But yeah, I would love to see some of the edgier characters in epic Mickey too
7152000	7154960	But since they're virtually unknown outside of Italy not much chance of that aye
7154960	7162480	Anyway, let's and take care of pikaruno. Thank you for the email pikaruno and just for you since you know, you brought it up
7168160	7170160	The health
7171440	7176400	Yeah, I remember rolling my eyes when they were showing that shit my god, what is this bullshit
7176400	7182460	Next email and this is actually from rubber
7184840	7186320	There was
7186320	7193560	Link from the Star Tribune last year Best Buy it lost a staggering 1.2 billion as it was deeply discounted merchandise to keep pace
7193680	7195680	with rivals Amazon and Walmart
7196200	7199240	All in all Best Buy hopes to shed 800 million
7200080	7203300	Over the next three years saving the company plans to use
7203300	7209700	You know savings the company plans to use to fund its new connected store remodels international expansion and digital service
7209860	7215560	But even CEO Brian Dunn admits the company's efforts to remake itself are fraught with frustration and uncertainty
7216560	7221120	So well, it's tough because a lot of people are going into Best Buy and then they'll figure out what they want
7221120	7228220	Then they go buy it on Amazon because it's cheaper. Yeah, so I mean it's it's gonna fries because Amazon
7228700	7230700	Doesn't have to staff a store
7230700	7233420	I mean they have to staff a warehouse, but they don't have to staff a store
7233420	7236220	So they're kind of able to make cuts that Best Buy can't make as easy
7236420	7239180	But yeah Best Buy is gonna have to be aggressive if they want to stay competitive
7239740	7244700	It will probably help that more states are forcing Amazon charge sales tax
7244700	7248380	Yeah, because there's a lot of people that use Amazon simply because they don't have to pay tax and they buy an Amazon
7248380	7250380	But that's gonna be changing
7250540	7254940	Unfortunately or fortunately depending on how you look at it. Okay, um next email
7254940	7258500	I have a neighbor of mine who owns a fairly large pasture on this pasture
7258500	7260580	He allows a number of animals to freely graze
7260980	7267100	Horses cows sheep whatever on the fence that lines the property is a series of signs that all say the same thing
7267220	7269220	Free manure inquire at the house
7269640	7276000	By now manure. He means bullshit fresh new high quality bullshit. My neighbor's bullshit is free to anyone
7277380	7281540	You just have to haul it away yourself as I looked at my Twitter feed on Wednesday
7281540	7284540	I began to wonder why people aren't all a Twitter about my neighbor's bullshit
7284540	7289980	Sure, the bullshit that came out on Wednesday that related to the PlayStation 4 is hotly anticipated
7290100	7295960	But the recent bullshit about the Xbox lube is frequently and abundantly deposited, but my neighbor's bullshit is actually real
7296520	7302780	My neighbor's bullshit isn't as an actually tangible thing as opposed to the PlayStation bullshit and the Xbox lube bullshit
7302780	7306640	Perhaps you can figure out this quandary while I simply cannot stay black entertainment
7306940	7310120	This message has been brought to you by a big juicy tender succulent steak
7310900	7312900	YUM
7312900	7318860	Mainly because no one actually cares about actual bullshit. Did you see the ad today for the chick-fil-a steak sandwich?
7318860	7320960	Yes, I did. That was pretty funny
7321980	7323740	Is that it for emails or we have one more?
7323740	7329980	Yeah one more but I've wondered if you had a rebuttal for why does why is real bullshit not as talked about as
7330700	7332700	the bullshit people actually care about
7334680	7337780	Because your neighbor's not famous and doesn't make video game systems the end
7337780	7343140	I um, there's a lot of game sites that run with bullshit or else they'd have nothing else to publish
7344060	7349620	Speaking of shit. EA is still up for grabs for worst company in America
7349620	7354620	So if you go to consumerist calm and vote I believe tomorrow is when they're having I don't know
7354620	7357420	It's tomorrow or maybe they're really part next week. They're actually
7358140	7359220	voting
7359220	7365700	For the semi-finals so they can they can do it and this year. They're also giving away three different
7365700	7367220	Uh
7367220	7371260	Golden poos, they're gonna have the golden poo the silver poo and the bronze poo this year Wow
7371340	7375440	So they still have a chance as long as they win next round, you know, well
7376540	7378880	Congratulations. Yeah two emails left
7379580	7381460	Excuse me
7381460	7382860	Thank you
7382860	7385740	Yes, I had to burp. Oh, well, dear olr today
7385740	7390420	I was cleaning up the garage while listening to last night's podcast two hours and a lot of packing later
7390420	7393700	I unearthed an unexpected surprise a slim ps1
7393700	7399380	Apparently it once belonged to my uncle who scrapped it years ago. I immediately began to wipe the dust and chemicals away
7399740	7402420	Hoping to restore it. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any game
7402420	7406980	So I decided to test the lens with an audio CD after browsing through my uncle's CD collection
7406980	7409820	I knew what album I had to choose Queen greatest hits
7410540	7415260	Good pick after anxiously connecting all of the cables and the single controller
7415260	7419000	I was relieved to find the ps1 was still kicking and better yet. I jammed it
7419000	7421720	Don't stop me now as a celebration anthem. That's long as great
7421720	7425500	I love the scene in Shaun of the Dead where they're beating up the zombie to that song. That's the best
7425500	7429940	I haven't touched a ps1 since 2000 back when I was nine. Shut up
7431200	7436500	The nostalgia began to return to me. I'm not enjoying all this age of our listeners this week
7436500	7439940	I remember being blown away by games like Ein Hunderr
7440420	7447580	Gran Turismo and Twisted Metal my question to you guys is this with my first ever ps1. What game should I immediately own?
7447580	7452780	Also were the seminal titles the ps1. What were the seminal titles the ps1 era?
7452780	7458660	I like all types of games RPGs platformers horror sports fighting rhythm you name it also
7458660	7462060	Where can I even find ps1 games anymore? Thanks in advance. Love the show
7462060	7467100	Keep up the good work Randy from Texas flea markets. You can find a lot of PlayStation 1 games that still Amazon
7467100	7471620	Oh, really? They still sell PlayStation 1 games people still stuff in them as long as oh, yeah
7473620	7477340	Castlevania Symphony of the Night you should own right now. Yes, you definitely should own that one
7477340	7484020	I'm jumping flash. If you enjoy music games at all per app of the rapper and it's sequel. Ooh, Jammie Lammy. I
7485340	7486740	also
7486740	7491360	Think they changed the whole import thing on the old on the PS slim didn't they?
7491780	7496960	Yeah, because yeah, that was the one that you had to use the memory card thing
7498260	7502400	I never had slim. I just had the old one that we have the like the
7502400	7507400	Cartridge in the back. Yeah. Yeah, you might as well get a file pass at Final Fantasy 7 copy too. Cuz that was
7509720	7512680	I'm Honda, of course, you mentioned it. Mm-hmm

7568200	7591000	All right. So good luck finding your PlayStation game and just for you just for you

7596960	7603560	How about the last email? All right. How about it? Okay. Greetings. Olr. It's your friendly neighborhood turtle question of the week
7603560	7609600	What game are you looking forward to most this year not including January through March also a comment on Skyrim. I
7610280	7612280	almost never buy games
7612400	7614800	Day one because of cost which I believe are too high
7615080	7619220	But I did buy Skyrim sunk 40 hours into it in two weeks and haven't touched it until today
7619880	7622480	Thanks to seem constantly advertising the latest mods
7622480	7626760	I decided to give it another go but only after spending two hours respecting my character
7626760	7631900	Being able to respect plus the sky UI has made the game playable again
7632120	7635760	By the way, the HD graphics pack made the game look that much better
7636280	7640960	Anywho, keep up the good work and I'll listen to your answer tomorrow your loyal turtle in Philly serious turtle
7640960	7645440	I kind of want to play it on my PC. So do I I don't know if my PC can run it though
7645440	7647440	I think it can I'm sure my
7647720	7649720	Games, I'm looking forward to this year
7650600	7654560	Kingdom heart dream drop distance. Yes, which is out in Japan, but it's not out here yet
7654560	7656280	Um
7656280	7659920	The new Tomb Raider looks really good. Still. I'm interested in that
7659920	7663760	I kind of think there's gonna be stuff at e3 that we don't know about yet
7663760	7666400	That will be very exciting especially with the Wii U and everything
7667800	7671140	Also, it's looking very very very good that I'm gonna be able to go to e3 this year
7671140	7675880	So I'm very excited about that because I didn't go last year. Really. I sat in the lobby last year
7676640	7680840	But hopefully this year I'll get to get say hi missy three I do it is fun
7680840	7687560	I I do miss it, but I can't you have a baby. Yeah separate the kids when the kids 18, then you go to e3
7688960	7690600	or
7690600	7692680	You can't take kids under 18
7696320	7703320	By four hopefully he'll he'll understand that daddy goes away sometimes. Yeah, he's just at the point now where it's just like
7704200	7706200	You know, he's very clingy

7711880	7717400	Yeah, there are companies doing I I get the stay back at work and work

7725840	7727600	kicking back

7737800	7742120	Thank you guys. Let's get to the F use of the making me work the F use of the week
7742120	7747000	Here we go. And some special April Fool's F you music has picked by Loki tonight
7747000	7760200	You know, I tried to find the whole video for that song just cuz I needed to hear it in context it's awesome anyway
7763720	7765720	Really well looped I
7765880	7768040	Was I'm just mesmerized for a second
7768660	7770320	anyway, um
7770320	7772920	God, Rob, you need to stop that because that's too distracting
7772920	7780080	I thought if I get the sax guy off the screen, this is the music is too distracting. I played saxophone. So I'm like
7782040	7788520	So anyway, um, my if he goes to this music and to spilling coffee all over my wallet
7789960	7792980	Didn't do that in my kitchen. Did you know I did it at Starbucks
7794440	7796440	a
7796880	7799940	Few to having to go to bed early tonight because I'm starting a job tomorrow
7799940	7805240	I mean, I'm happy to be working. I mean, I would like to just get paid for doing nothing. That would be great
7805720	7806880	but
7806880	7810120	it's gonna be nice to be productive again and
7810640	7812640	Damn it. Yeah
7813720	7817960	But well, you know what sucks about it is it what sacks about it
7822320	7826760	It what sucks is that I have a class that's on during my work shift
7826760	7830980	So, uh, I'm basically gonna have to miss the rest of the semester that class
7831040	7834840	But I've already told the teacher that if I got a job job comes first
7835360	7837360	There you go. Mookie
7837880	7844560	McDonald's for not being able to make food correctly. I mean, it's not that hard. Seriously. You're calling that food
7845360	7849800	Well, it's hardly food. But like I said, there's few McDonald's on the way here
7849800	7852520	No, Burger Kings that are right on the way here. So
7852520	7858720	It's like well, I could drive way the fuck out of the way to go to Burger King or I could just be quick and getting
7858720	7864040	Gone, so I was quick. I was actually almost gonna get their fish McBites that they have now
7864360	7869080	Although I think that would be poison. So I'm not really sure if I should do that. I'm not
7870240	7875640	that's it if you do the people that keep wanting to compare about a royale the Hunger Games get over it and
7876360	7878360	F you to
7878360	7885580	F you to Jelly Belly, I am so mad. I am no longer gonna be able to eat Jelly Bellies anymore
7885580	7888880	What happened? I'm boycotting Jelly Bellies. They had
7889960	7895680	Rick Santorum at their factory giving a speech and then did this whole
7896120	7901340	$1,000 a plate fundraiser dinner at Jelly Belly because I never knew this they contribute to all these causes
7901720	7906040	Which I don't you know, I I'm not mad at like
7906040	7910840	I'm not the person who usually get up there and say F you to all Republicans and all this because I don't feel that way
7910840	7917200	He's evil. There's a lot of Republicans I do like and there's some progressive ideas within Republicanism that it's cool
7917200	7923840	And you know, I'm fine with that. It's Rick Santorum. I have a fucking problem with he's he's just he's evil. He's vile
7923840	7930360	He's gross and racist if you saw that thing this week, so he's just a walking festering pile of shit
7930360	7936200	It's just he's he's the village idiot of this country and deserves to be pointed and laughed out wherever he goes
7936200	7942520	And I'm just sad that the tainted he is tainted the Jelly Belly factory and I can no longer support that company
7942520	7948520	And I urge all of you to so I was I was hoping that maybe it was all like they were gonna do a Bernie's
7948520	7955160	Bots for Santorum flavored jelly beans, but that didn't end up being the case. Unfortunately, why did they all taste like shit?
7956400	7958400	and Luper kid I
7958400	7960320	Don't understand
7960320	7966000	so F you to Rick Santorum if you do the fact that people actually are voting for him for president and
7967000	7969000	There you go. That's the F use of the week
7969600	7970920	moving on
7970920	7972920	Loki, all right
7974080	7976440	So moving on let's talk a little bit about
7977720	7979360	changes and
7979360	7981360	Sega unfortunately
7981640	7987000	changing for the worst they are canceling games cutting jobs and restructuring and
7987000	7991040	Of course, they're expected net incomes down almost 50%
7991280	7994520	And of course, they're gonna make some changes regarding that
7994520	7998960	They're streamlining the operations of Sega both in the United States and Europe
8000680	8008380	They're gonna focus on key franchises including Sonic Football Manager total war and aliens
8009960	8011960	So
8011960	8018520	Yeah, it's interesting funny enough though, they're actually still doing an Olympics game in June so
8019600	8021600	Maybe they're restructuring after that
8021840	8028680	But uh, oh no that um, Sonic and Mario Olympic game did crazy good on the Wii. No, I'm not talking about that
8028680	8032840	I'm talking about the actual Olympic games, you know the sports game that's on
8033560	8035200	ps3 and 360
8035200	8040080	But maybe for that same reason they're doing that. I mean, that'd be you know, every cool
8040080	8044680	But yeah, I can understand they try a lot of experimental stuff and it doesn't always work out
8044680	8046680	If only they'd release Shenmue 3
8047200	8053920	If only well, I think they kind of do that stuff though the a little bit more experimental stuff though on Xbox Live Arcade
8053920	8057760	So I don't know necessarily we're gonna see the end of that kind of stuff, you know
8057760	8061400	Cuz after all they're gonna be doing, you know jet set radio here. So I
8062520	8064520	It's very possible that they'll still do Shenmue
8067320	8068920	All right
8068920	8072120	I'm kind of sad to hear about this obviously because it's Sega
8072640	8077200	I'm also sad because that means less of a chance that Phantasy Star Online 2 will come out in America
8077320	8082560	Which I was really looking forward to hope it will I'm still hoping it will too and maybe we'll hear something about it
8082560	8085720	83 but just the whole you know
8086560	8091840	Sega not doing so hot is kind of depressing and humbling news dark soccer
8091840	8095760	I know you've got to be feeling a little sad about the changes at Sega. Yeah
8095760	8101360	I'm also pissed off at my laptop, but that's another thing. Did Sega build your laptop? No, it's a piece of shit. Oh, I'm sorry
8102800	8109080	Niche in our chat room is wondering the same thing. What's gonna have our Nietzsche probably what's gonna happen to my PlayStation online to Sega
8109080	8112240	What about PSO to you bastards? That's how I feel
8114800	8118800	Huh, we'll see just stop putting out the crappy Sonic games and maybe it'll be better
8121440	8123440	Who knows all right moving on
8123440	8129960	It's a bummer Sega didn't have this because I'm sure there's a bunch of fans that would be really excited about this game
8129960	8131960	but that would be
8132480	8136240	Firefly the arcade game that is not a joke is it um
8136240	8141520	I don't know because here's the thing the story was published March 31st
8142120	8148040	So I'm kind of like it kind of could go either way. So I'm taking this with a huge grain of salt
8148040	8154840	And some people in the comments are saying it's April Fool's which if it is an April Fool's joke
8154840	8157240	Your April Fool's jokes are supposed to go up April 1st
8157760	8161920	What time does it say? It doesn't say it just says March 31st 2012
8161920	8165520	So I'm gonna take it with a grain of salt is probably as a joke
8165600	8171640	But let's entertain let's entertain the idea that it's real for a minute. Let's entertain if it could be realistic or not
8171640	8179520	Apparently because of the 10th anniversary of the show Firefly even though it had a you know short life on television
8179520	8182720	It's very cult and now they're talking about a Firefly
8183320	8187920	Arcade game see the thing about this is the screenshot does look really fake to me
8189320	8196760	The whole thing looks very it does it's a whole like first-person shooter and all that and that cabinet too just doesn't look no
8197320	8199440	Let's assume it could be real though
8199440	8204840	Let's or you know, like, you know, somebody was really thinking about this would this be something worth doing?
8205560	8207560	Because it is a bit of a cultish franchise
8207560	8212840	But I could you know a lot of stuff come from kind of back of the day ends up coming full circle again
8212840	8218480	I don't even know necessarily. It's an arcade game, but like a pinball game. I could totally see a Firefly pinball game
8218480	8225040	Yeah, couldn't you I really don't think it would happen. I mean then again, I'm I'm sure Joss would like the money
8225040	8232200	They wouldn't make an arcade game based on a property that's niche like that, especially since arcade games nowadays
8232200	8237560	It's just like you've got to have some sort of gimmick to get people to come to the arcades to play the game
8238000	8241540	They're not gonna spend the money to make cabinets for an arcade game like that
8242800	8247560	But hey April Fool's haha. Yeah, you can actually this is totally Photoshop
8247560	8251120	Because if you look at the edges of this graphic that's supposed to be the side of the cabinet
8251120	8255060	It's not like a pic. It just looks bad. So F you to
8255840	8259400	People that do their April Fool's jokes on March 31st arcade heroes. Yep
8260640	8265560	It's probably just said, you know, they probably did it on April 1st to them
8265560	8272080	But it probably time-stamped on their server perhaps or they just didn't in March 31st. So people are well, maybe maybe
8273760	8275760	All right moving on
8276280	8278280	Oh, yeah, that would be me wouldn't it?
8278280	8281560	Yes, ma'am. How about Tesco? Do you know what Tesco is? Uh,
8282200	8287600	They are a big grocery store in Britain, right? Yes. Did you know that they've opened markets in the United States?
8287600	8289640	Yes, because they're fresh and easy. That's how I knew that
8289640	8295360	Yep, and they're being protested how the new stores that open here really I guess Tesco is very anti-union
8295560	8301080	So some of the union grocers in the area are protesting when I drove by there was actually an ambulance in front of it
8301840	8305960	Maybe they started fighting each other. Who knows maybe maybe well at any rate
8305960	8311800	Um, the supermarket has now say are they are the home of gaming in the advertisement over in the UK?
8311800	8318880	Well, I guess since game UK went under they've there's an opening actually game. There's no more game store closures. Oh, really?
8318880	8324880	Yeah, there's an article on that on a Eurogamer. Oh, I did. I didn't hear that follow-up. They didn't close any more stores
8324880	8328240	huh, um, so basically they're saying that
8330000	8334240	They have more gaming stores in the UK than any other retailers
8334240	8337680	so that's three hundred and ninety three open at midnight for new releases and
8338200	8345800	That there will have over ten thousand titles available online for UK delivery and day one pre-order shipping
8346920	8354120	So I have no idea what to say about that. This reminds me of when 7-eleven got into gaming for a hot minute
8354840	8356840	They stopped doing that right? I
8356840	8365440	I Dan is friends with somebody who managed that was a big flop. Well, of course, it was a big flop
8366160	8367240	What about this though?
8367240	8367640	I mean
8367640	8374640	I remember back in the day a lot of grocery stores had like video rentals shops in it and
8374840	8377860	You could also rent games there too. So like
8378600	8384180	Integrating and a lot of them still sell DVDs. It's not a bad idea considering that you know, the
8384180	8389720	Video rental markets getting it's coming back because there's not a lot of you know
8389720	8393480	There will blockbusters have kind of closed down Hollywood's closed down
8393800	8400200	Most of your mom-and-pop shops have closed down now they're starting to kind of reopen back up. Although kiosks are kind of popular nowadays
8401280	8404280	Well, I found the thing about game by the way
8404820	8410660	Yeah that um, it was up capita. That's the parent company of comet
8411120	8413120	is bidding for game again and
8413120	8420800	And there's three hundred and thirty three stores still open two hundred eleven of them being game and one hundred and twenty-two being game station and
8423200	8424920	Basically
8424920	8433120	They were initially blocked by the lending syndicate that owned them including the Royal Bank of Scotland. So
8434280	8441440	That was what stopped them before so could video games at the grocery store work. I think especially the cheaper
8441440	8444680	Market could work because you see a lot of that at Target
8444680	8447560	I mean yes Target sells new games and all that too
8447560	8452320	But they also like up by the registers usually have the $20 Wii games and those seem to do
8452320	8455560	All right, like they sell more there than they probably would at a GameStop or something
8455560	8458540	well, Tesco is pretty big too, and I think they are like a
8459200	8466240	Wide very broad in their services and markets. So sure probably like a Safeway here. You know, it's got a lot of stuff
8466240	8468240	It's not necessarily just the store
8468240	8473280	But usually the full-service deli and China, you know a lot of places I've I'm sorry go ahead
8473440	8477360	Well, as far as I understand it, it actually is a bit more like a super target. Oh
8477920	8480860	Okay, you know Tesco's I mean, but it was big supermarket
8480860	8487640	But like you can get or maybe like a what's that thing? That's um, they had in Washington that uh, Fred Meyer higher. Yeah
8488360	8490360	The sum of everything, okay
8491400	8495320	All right. Well, uh, Loki if you don't have any comments and let's go to the next story
8495320	8500640	Let's um, let's talk about something of kind of a really cool piece of technology
8501560	8507320	browser quest it was an MMO tech demo built by Mozilla and
8509000	8517280	It's basically an MMO that works in browsers and they've got this little kind of almost looks like a 16-bit MMO that they're
8518120	8523200	They can play and it actually will kind of work in any browser
8523200	8525840	I guess that supports HTML 5 and
8526800	8533420	They even have the full source available on github if you want to create your own MMO based off that
8533840	8538540	Which is pretty cool. And if you want to check it out, you can go to
8540080	8542080	Mozilla
8542400	8544400	Org
8544400	8552800	a future of MMOs possibly sounds like just another like
8555280	8559080	Yeah, I mean how many browser-based games do we have these days it's a lot
8559080	8564120	I think in the Ultima one that EA had but I mean something that runs in HTML 5 though
8564120	8569680	That would be compatible with you know, like iOS and stuff like that. Oh, I get where they're going with that then
8569680	8576000	Okay, like on mobile devices and stuff. It's not or like all games radio is compatible with HTML 5 and you can get on your
8577000	8579000	iDevice and all games.com
8579000	8585780	Yeah, so they're saying yeah, it's written in HTML 5 in JavaScript and can be played in Firefox Chrome Safari
8586600	8590280	with web sockets enabled also in Opera and
8591120	8593580	They say of course iOS devices and stuff like that
8593580	8600740	If you want to play the game, it's browserquest.mozilla.org is the URL to go on
8601940	8603380	Alright one more story for you guys

8621260	8625740	I remember one of the first CD-ROM games that ever came out was return to Zork
8625980	8632000	But there's also Zork Grand Inquisitor Zork nemesis all these games came out and then of course the text adventure games Zork

8723940	8728700	Slash olr and see what tweets are in store for us
8729660	8734340	Gamer girl tweets us saying is PlayStation Plus really worth the money
8734340	8737700	I was thinking about getting a subscription, but I want to know if it's worth the money
8738260	8742700	I think I'm the only one that actually has PlayStation Plus here
8742700	8748940	I'll tell you this if you use your PlayStation a lot and especially if you buy from the store a lot then yes
8748940	8755040	There's you know so many discounts and things and a lot of freebies that you get with PlayStation as well
8755180	8757900	So if you think you'd kind of be into some of those freebies
8757980	8760620	You want to get like one arcade game every couple weeks or so?
8760620	8764500	I think it's a pretty good deal and getting journey early was really nice as well
8764860	8767940	so I think there's a lot of good stuff there, but
8769220	8773340	It really depends on how much you love your PlayStation meanwhile the phones are ringing

8785620	8787620	not much and to
8788020	8792300	Talk about something that happened last night on the cartoon networks
8792940	8800900	I don't know if the rest of you and the rest of the anime community ever caught this but Konami was on instead usual
8800900	8806580	Adult swim bumpers yes, I I heard because I have a bunch of anime fans on my facebook
8806580	8811960	Who are flipping the fuck out that to nami was doing this? I guess usually there are years past. They've been showing the room
8812540	8814540	But they didn't do that this year
8814980	8816580	so yeah, and
8816580	8818580	to nami came back and
8819180	8821180	Hopefully this and I'm not
8823140	8828860	You know how I sent you guys that you know yeah, how you guys have written above a podcast it just pretty much kicked it
8828860	8833260	But well, I'm gonna steal that podcast name right here now
8833780	8837700	Games and more entertainment radio like they've just pretty much ceased
8838100	8845420	They're not doing anything anymore, and just like I mean like any news fix on the weekly basis. We're also still left
8846700	8852020	Well is that another yeah, is that another indie show or is that a corporate bat back show?
8853020	8855420	No, it's another indie show well
8855420	8859460	I don't I don't like to throw shade at the other indie shows because they all work hard at what they do
8859460	8862000	but everybody's got different preferences, so
8863060	8865060	yeah, and I
8865460	8868740	Will say here um you know with the factor that?
8869620	8872860	16th Empress beat me with the last one the ps2
8873500	8881000	Has anyone heard any announcements or the PlayStation 3 versions at all nope we kind of think that Konami may have just given up
8881000	8881900	On the whole damn series
8881900	8888180	Which is a darn shame because I think I think there's opportunity there for them to do like a massive collection on the PlayStation 3
8888180	8892380	But that would require them investing in another controller or at least a converter for the old ones
8892380	8895420	Which I would think would be easy to do, but I mean they don't want to do it
8895420	8901940	There are there are controller converters for the PlayStation 2 controllers. I mean they already work for the guitar hero stuff
8901940	8907620	I mean it shouldn't be that hard. I think they should be able to work on the beat me
8907620	8912080	a controller it's if anyone in the club would like to test that out
8912080	8915820	It's possibly not be willing to import there could be lag
8915820	8919020	I don't know especially with the music game lag could kill it
8919020	8922580	But I mean if they did it with the guitars and so forth and I don't see why it is impossible
8922580	8927200	But I think it's just an investment on Konami's part, and they have to know that the sales would be there
8927200	8928200	I'm kind of surprised
8928200	8929340	They wouldn't do something
8929340	8934800	Akin to what they did when 2d x7 style came out where they were like all right if a hundred thousand people pre-order it
8934800	8939300	Then we'll make it otherwise. We're not going to which is kind of the early if you think about it
8939300	8945240	That's like Kickstarter circa seven years ago, so maybe Konami needs a Kickstarter
8945240	8950520	Which is kind of sad because it's not like they're hurting that bad, but I I don't know
8950520	8956800	I they've got to see that the fans are there for 2dx to sell on the PlayStation 3 and then maybe they'll do it
8956800	8960380	But certainly in America beat mania didn't sell
8960380	8967340	Oh, yeah, and I think it was because the setlist was halfway the problem, and that's what I've heard from many
8967340	8969340	Imani fans of that place
8969660	8973660	But it's one of the problems on top of well. It's way too easy
8975700	8980020	Yeah, I think what they did that was very unfortunate is that they just waited too long
8980020	8981720	They were very naive that
8981720	8985140	Bemani fans wouldn't just import the game and play it over here
8985140	8989460	And I think a lot of people got there fixed that way so by the time they released a game here
8989460	8992080	It was old news to the Bemani fans
8992080	8999300	And it was too too obscure for regular people what if they were fucking serious about it what they should have done is release the
8999300	9004340	Games in parody they should have put out 2dx night style in Japan and then put it out over here
9004460	9011380	And maybe change whatever licenses you have to change, but keep every single Konami original so at least you got about 90%
9011380	9013380	The same game you know
9013700	9016220	Yeah, which is why I'm currently on the search
9016220	9022700	For you know something like bm 98 for the Macintosh or some of the equivalent because
9023220	9028780	I'm thinking about them to get one of those joy to to you for a one of those ps2 to usd
9028900	9032620	Adapters my computer just so I can play beat me yeah well
9032980	9038860	You're gonna get similar. You know what you need to do you need to write a letter to Konami
9038860	9043940	You need to say I am a concerned fan, and that's you know once Konami hears voices
9043940	9050220	But anything is possible at e3. I mean would it be cool if it may be the Wii U could become a controller somehow
9051260	9055200	Hey, what about Twitter? I'm sure it's well. They have a Twitter
9055820	9061940	Tweet them the money clear the body fans of the world tweet Konami to bring beat me to the ps3
9062540	9064540	It works with president
9064540	9072720	So we can import it all right all right well DS. What would DS fan? I gotta let you go and take more calls, but thanks to the call
9073860	9077020	Yeah, peace out and keep the shows rocking. We will buy
9078100	9083980	1 8 7 7 game olr us name on skype is orange launch right a tweet Konami tell them you are a concerned fan
9086580	9092840	Have they done at that I think they're still putting them out the arcades in Japan though right there's they just announced a test locating
9092840	9098500	Another one so it's weird. They're still doing it in arcades, but it's kind of like Konami is saying this only is working in arcades
9098500	9100220	It's not really working on home
9100220	9101740	It's weird
9101740	9105660	1 8 7 7 game olr username on Skype is orange lounge radio
9106540	9111600	Going to some Tweety tweets here dark Tetsuya says coming to the site this week
9111600	9115960	I've got something planned for the listeners to participate in so stay tuned
9116620	9118620	That doesn't sound like an April Fool's joke
9119420	9121420	Stay tuned
9121420	9124200	Moving on s2100 Matt tweets us
9124200	9128600	I know it's a video game show, but I played cards against humanity the card game
9128600	9131200	It's apples to apples, but M rated well
9131200	9136920	You've never heard of this now Loki have you of course and hunt tell so you you're very familiar with cards against humanity, right?
9137000	9144660	Yes, cards against humanity is very inappropriate apples apples a game. What makes it so great. Just its level of inappropriateness. Yes
9146480	9148040	All right
9148040	9155320	Going to watch dragon who tweets us mr.. Pandaria is great. Just finished the starting area. How did you get past?
9156080	9160240	All of those freaking pandas and some of those quests that must have taken a lot of patience
9160440	9163840	So the art styles neat though. I do like the way pandaria looks
9163840	9166080	It's cute if you want to see it later dark soccer
9166080	9170160	We can fire it up on the computer before you go peek sure be fun
9170800	9173960	All right going to some tweets from Tiger claw
9173960	9182120	1877 game olr or a username on Skype is orange laundry you tiger claw says why Soulcalibur 5 only had
9182360	9188240	1-4th of a full story mode I did feel like story mode and Soulcalibur 5 seemed to be lacking a little bit
9188800	9195760	But what happened was Soulcalibur 5 apparently it's an interview that was on train to game with the producer daishi odomasha
9196560	9203000	Odashima, sorry says the story mode shipped with the game was a fourth of what they had planned quote
9203000	9208320	Our first plan on the storyboard was that that we had every character story and actually we do have it in the studio
9208320	9214160	But time wise manpower wise we weren't able to do it and only one-fourth of what we plan to do is in the game
9214160	9219400	That was a dumb thing for them to admit. We could we can do it. If only we had the DLC
9219400	9220440	Yeah, that's why I'm thinking
9220440	9225160	I just think that was a dumb thing for them to say I mean they shouldn't I think they should have kept those cards closer
9225160	9227160	Or their chest sorry to say
9227160	9233960	But it did feel to me that story mode and Soulcalibur 5 was a little bit lacking
9234880	9235920	so
9235920	9240120	Tiger claw sends us another tweet Warhammer 40k dark millennium
9240280	9246720	It's going single-player because layoffs have hit relic and vigil more layoffs man. This is a bummer
9247640	9251660	So Warhammer 40k dark millennium. It's now a single-player action game
9251660	9257600	It will have multiplayer elements the president and CEO of thq Brian Farrell put out a press release
9258120	9262960	Saying quote as previously announced we have been actively looking for a business partner for the game as MMO
9263160	9267980	However based on changing market dynamics and the additional investment required to complete the game as an MMO
9268000	9274320	We believe the right direction for us is to shift the title from an MMO to a premium experience with single and multiplayer gameplay
9275040	9279760	robust digital content and community features so shit tons of DLC y'all
9279760	9281760	Actually
9281920	9283360	As
9283360	9287560	Much as it sucks that these studios got closed and so forth this makes sense
9287560	9292760	I think the MMO market is really volatile right now, and it's really tough to make a showing
9292760	9295640	I mean look at where Star Wars is at there
9295640	9301720	They've come the second best probably to getting Wow and even they're starting to lose some people who are getting kind of bored of the
9301720	9303480	game so
9303480	9305480	MMOs are hard to do
9305480	9310100	Phone calls are a lot easier to do we have a phone call coming in now higher on orange launch radio. Who's this?
9310780	9314100	Hey, it's pork chop pork chop. What's on your mind, buddy? Hello?
9314780	9315700	Well, it's good
9315700	9321580	Did you start a talk about the whole Soul Calibur thing because I was really let down by that that pissed me off something serious
9321900	9323900	Pork chop, where are you from?
9324320	9326320	Ireland actually I could tell
9326860	9331900	Yeah, love it. You guys stay up late to listen to the show over there, so yeah
9331900	9337340	Well, I do yeah what wasn't that a dumb thing for them to say that they they purposely you know
9337340	9340620	They only finished a quarter of it. I was so pissed off
9340620	9344180	I mean I remember playing through the story mode okay, and it was it took me a day
9344180	9348340	I played it in one fucking day, and I played that I paid like
9348860	9355380	It'd be about what 40 or 50 euros something like that be about 50 60 dollars something like that in the exchange
9355380	9357820	I went and played that it took me like
9357820	9364180	To maybe not even an hour. I played it, and I said fuck this. I'm really disappointed
9364180	9368580	So what I did was I brought it back. I got Arkham City, and I was much happier
9369420	9374380	Thank God the creative character modes at least still fun and the fighting core game is still really fun
9374380	9378260	But yeah, the story mode was a little a little bit disappointing there, so right
9378260	9382020	I mean if you finish it in an hour. It's not worth buying for that price. I mean come on
9382020	9386180	I mean, I don't even buy full-price games anymore never mind anything like nowadays
9386180	9389260	I just look in GameStop for games that are like two to three years old
9389580	9395020	Like I just picked up Final Fantasy 13 for what six six years is oh god. It was cheap
9396020	9397780	You know I'm clapping yeah
9397780	9403420	I've been waiting ten years for an angry Irishman rant on this show and it had to happen on April Fool's Day
9403420	9408480	You should really see the look on Rob's face right now. He just looks like he's won the lottery
9408480	9416240	Yeah, well, I'm glad I can fulfill your fantasy or whatever the hell is going on. That was Rob's final fantasy
9420160	9425440	I mean full-price games nowadays really aren't worth it. That's that's the fact that a matter. I weigh it like for
9426320	9428440	Ages, so I just look at trawling through games
9428440	9433160	I'm looking at games that are really old and fucking nobody wants to play them anymore
9433160	9436920	They've gone down to like I got Duke Nukem forever. Sorry to tell you that
9436920	9439880	I had to play that because I was a fan back in the day
9440360	9441520	Oh
9441520	9445280	God like why not I mean I'm never gonna pay for the price for a game again
9445280	9448200	That's pretty much how I'm looking at it at this stage. Port Chop
9448200	9451240	Let me ask you this then and maybe I'm baiting you for another rant here
9451240	9457300	But it certainly begs worth asking when you kind of are sick of only buying these new games that are so expensive and so forth
9457320	9459000	How do you feel about this story?
9459000	9465240	We were talking about earlier that by the time the PlayStation 4 and whatever's next on Xbox are out or Orbis or whatever it's called
9465240	9469280	The used games aren't gonna happen. They're gonna block use games
9470040	9474440	Pain in the fucking ass. I mean I as I said I said in chapter
9474440	9477600	There was always I always favored hard copies over digital anyway
9477600	9481160	I mean I still buy CDs and I'm never gonna use iTunes or any of that shit
9481320	9485120	I'm still doing that to this day is like CDs are my vinyl in a way
9485300	9490040	So I'm just gonna keep doing that and pray to fuck that you know Sony can cop
9490040	9497400	I mean Steam's really successful. I kind of favor those guys because they aren't kind of overcharging the fans or anything me and my best friend
9497400	9498800	He kind of works in the industry
9498800	9504000	And he was telling me Steam are basically the daddy at this stage and they look to be like some sort of Messiah
9504360	9507040	So it's looking good on their end, but Sony are
9507880	9510880	Overcharging people way too fucking much as far as I'm concerned
9510880	9511360	Yeah
9511360	9512800	you know and
9512800	9517200	What's funny what you made me think about while you were talking about steam and the way that they're viewed in the industry
9517200	9522520	There was a rumor a couple weeks ago, or maybe even last week on this show about the whole steam box
9522520	9528640	And although Val was quick to shoot that down that that's not actually happening. You can't help but think holy shit
9528640	9536080	What if you have the PlayStation Orbis which doesn't play used games and you have the Xbox 360 or excuse me 720 or lube?
9536080	9537640	Or whatever it's called that doesn't play used games
9537640	9539920	And then you have the steam box
9540360	9545280	That will have all these sales all the time and what-have-you and kind of give the gamers
9545280	9549720	The value that they're looking for to pay for games. It could be a bloodbath
9550640	9555240	Yeah, I think while steam would definitely come out on top if you're gonna say that I mean, you know
9555240	9560560	The the offers to come out but like my friend actually showed me all of the receipts he had for the past
9561080	9564880	Couple of months and I looked at and I compared PlayStation store
9564880	9570600	I was like what the fuck am I doing with a ps3 if I can get all these games all the same games
9570600	9578480	Nearly every single title I have he had a receipt for and it was like oh god the sales that were on he picked up
9578480	9584660	Like 50 games within the space of three months and he taught it it up and he showed me that the end total
9584920	9587920	Which would have been if they weren't on sale was around
9588400	9594560	400 and I was like wow and he actually said I never paid that much for it and I was like, holy shit
9594560	9596560	I want a steam account
9596560	9602520	Fantastic, could that be a regional thing though? Because most of it here in the u.s. It seems like especially when new games come out
9603040	9606640	It's about the same you'd play on the PlayStation Network that you would on
9606640	9612600	You know steam or whatever getting it on PC part of me wonders if PlayStation doesn't jack up the price even more
9613120	9618080	overseas in other countries and maybe it's that that pain of the
9619640	9622640	Whatever you want to call it translation of the cost or whatever is
9622640	9628040	Is truly causing the difference I still see it wouldn't surprise me
9628040	9633920	I mean even he said like games in America are way cheaper. I mean as far as I know I think they are anyway
9633920	9640520	Yeah, it's it's true. I'm not gonna sound like I'm bragging but it's true when I see how much you guys pay
9640680	9646200	You know in in you know euros or whatever currency we're looking at over there. It's it's
9646760	9651080	It's pretty crazy how much you guys are paying for stuff over there that we are
9651080	9655040	We're paying like on average like 10 to 15 percent less. Oh, I'm sure no
9655040	9658840	I mean when you look at the exchange rate, you can see it that but even the prices
9658840	9665400	I'm sure like, you know you in in terms of you know denominations of notes or money with bills as you call them
9665440	9667440	You know, I'm sure you could pay
9667600	9672400	Use two 20s to buy a good handful of games. Whereas that wouldn't even get you
9672400	9675560	Well, they get you close to one which is fucking ridiculous
9675560	9681760	I mean Ireland apparently the the capital of Ireland Dublin is one of the most expensive cities in Europe at this stage
9682080	9684320	You know, so it's fucking ridiculous
9684320	9690280	and that's why I have to go wait a couple of years for these games to come out and I have to go looking and
9690280	9695560	I'll be like, okay. I'm two or three. I just finished Deus Ex and that's like year two years
9695560	9700120	I finished Assassin's Creed a couple of days ago or a couple of months ago, pardon me
9700120	9706640	And you know, I'm playing catch-up at this stage, but you know what? I don't care. I'm not paying full price. It's fucking ridiculous
9707160	9709440	As long as you've got fun stuff to play now anyway
9710080	9711160	That's that's it
9711160	9711440	I mean
9711440	9715320	I'll have a good I have a good collection as it is and I've kept some of the really old ones and
9715360	9720920	Hope to play through and buy the rest of the sequels in the next you do five five years something like that
9720920	9725080	You could spend your entire life playing classic games and be totally satisfied
9725080	9729200	I mean look at the classic game of the week segment we do here on olr. We've been doing yeah
9729200	9734440	I was actually pleased you actually brought up Street Fighter because I'm a big fan and I got the Capcom classics collection
9734440	9737520	I played the shit out of that. So yeah, thanks for bringing that up this
9738000	9742440	We started that episode what 250 because it replaced your website of the week that we used to do
9742440	9745360	So that was about 250 and now it's 452
9745360	9752180	So you've done at least covered at least 200 and then some classic games and I still have plenty to go still plenty to go
9752180	9757480	I mean if you there's a wall of shelves behind my desk at home
9757480	9762680	That is literally loaded with video games and that's not even all of it brag brag brag
9765920	9771320	Have you actually got through most of them or are you waiting to play through them and kind of use one as game of the
9771320	9774160	Week at some stage. We've we've actually gone through most of them
9774160	9776280	I mean a lot of the games that my husband and I picked up
9776760	9781960	Our games that we knew played when we were younger. He was a big Sega guy and I was a big Nintendo girl

9799380	9805960	I went on a mad buzz about maybe two three years ago, and I decided fuck this. I have a dream cast

9881720	9887280	Rob is very fond of the Irish. I take it. It's I get mistaken as Irish all the time
9887280	9890920	I can't do that red hair. Well, it's look at that that little get-up
9890920	9897480	I wore to whom loud with a hat and everything. I did look kind of Irish even I'll admit that I am actually by heritage
9897480	9902440	I am half Scottish. So I look very Scottish. Am I that means that you greet people by head-butting them
9902520	9906840	My real name is Dutch. So I have a little more in common with sill

9916460	9922080	I have a Dutch name, but none of my blood kin are remotely Dutch. All right, we got another call on the line
9922080	9924120	So let's go to it. Hi, you're on orange launch radio. Who's this?
9925240	9930000	Hi, this is Stan. Hey Stan, what's up, buddy? Hey, I was just calling about
9930800	9938120	This intimate evening with Nobuo Matsu that I had a couple nights ago. Wait. Wait now, we don't need to hear about your
9938880	9940880	romantic
9940880	9946880	That's actually the name. Well, that was the name of the little concert that he had. It was kind of dirty. Yeah, yeah. Shut up.
9948320	9951680	Hey, don't tell me to shut up. It's my show. All right. Yeah, okay
9952640	9956560	No, but it was just this really small concert with there was just 150 people
9957200	9963520	It was Nobuo Matsu and Arne Roth who's this conductor in Chicago and it had this string quartet playing
9964000	9969520	uh dark world from final fantasy 6 and this new string quartet arrangement of
9969520	9976400	Fight with Seymour from final fantasy 10 and it sounded really good and I really I was really excited about it
9976400	9979760	So, of course, I I had my phone on me and I tried, you know
9979760	9983840	Sneaking my my camera on and I recorded the whole concert and I tried
9984480	9986480	on YouTube
9986720	9990320	Actually that sounds like you know what it was no it was worth it
9990320	9995680	I'm, sorry, it was the piracy the jail time was where it is going to be worth it because it was so good
9995680	10000640	I need to know but you know what? No, well the when the the songs were done I turned around to see you know
10001440	10004640	You know people climbing and stuff and the people had their camera right in front of their face
10004960	10008000	They were being very obvious about us. I was like whatever I was gonna say
10008000	10011840	I don't feel bad anymore an intimate evening in cell block five with stan
10015280	10020400	Here's the thing though, uh, how did you get into this concert if it's only 150 people
10020400	10026960	Um, it was being advertised I don't remember where it was being advertised but a friend of mine posted this this link on facebook
10026960	10033760	And I saw it said intimate evening with nobel mozzo. I read the description about how there's a limited seating and you get this
10034320	10037920	There's a meet and greet. Actually. This is what happened with the what do you get with the concert you get?
10038560	10042800	Well, he came out arnie roth came out and introduced and said hi and everything
10043440	10048160	Then he had nobel mozzo came out and then the orchestra came and played and then you know
10048160	10050960	the orchestra came and played and then there was a
10051680	10054880	Q&A session and then the whole audience got to do a meet and greet
10056000	10060560	Yeah, that's what you got with the concert. It was actually really good. That's awesome. So you got to get stuff signed and everything too
10064560	10067200	Hello, did you get to get yes, I think
10068160	10072640	I got my 3ds signed by nobel and arnie. It's really cool. That's awesome
10072640	10078000	So I think there's there's a little bit of lag going on. Yes. Hold on, please. Nope. Oh
10079040	10082480	Anyway, okay. I'm sorry. Hello. That's it. Hi you with us
10083600	10089840	Yeah, i'm so sorry. I'm on my phone. Oh, that's all right. I didn't get I didn't get to do that test number thing
10089840	10095920	I couldn't remember it. It's all good echo one, two, three, but that's okay. You're cool. Uh, oh, yeah, that's right. Okay 3ds
10095920	10100080	So yeah, I got to meet you got your 3ds. Oh, yeah, he signed my 3ds. Mm-hmm
10100080	10103920	Mm-hmm. So now I got to take a picture with him
10104560	10106560	Oh cool, and then I asked
10106800	10108800	I asked arnie roth
10110000	10115440	If he would ever consider having an amateur musician sit down session
10116080	10122080	Reading the actual orchestral music being able to experience the orchestra feel by being inside it
10122400	10125920	By paying like a small fee and he was actually really interested in the idea. Well
10125920	10132080	That's what he told me, but it sounded really cool because I really wanted to play, you know, final fantasy music
10132640	10139120	In an orchestral setting with arnie roth and nobu playing or conducting. I figured that'd be really really cool
10139440	10144400	That sounds like a heck of an experience and there's obviously lots of band nerds who are video game
10144560	10146960	And I say that endearingly because I was a band nerd in high school
10147120	10149120	There's lots of band nerds and video game nerds
10149360	10154080	Uh that you know are kind of into both those worlds that I think would just get the ultimate kick out of that
10154080	10156800	But now i'm gonna have to ask you. What do you what do you play in the orchestra?
10158160	10160660	Oh, um, actually nothing I play saxophone
10161840	10164480	So I wouldn't even be able to do this. So does dark soccer
10167040	10169040	Dark soccer is a
10170000	10176480	So, well, you know even okay, here's the thing though, even if you couldn't uh play the final fantasy music as part of the jam
10176560	10180800	What you could do is when the time's right you could just be there in the back and you can just bust out with this
10180800	10182800	This
10188000	10190800	There you go do your nice be the epic sax guy
10191920	10193440	All right, sweet
10193440	10195440	beatbox guy
10196000	10200080	All right, stan i'm gonna have to let you go because the connection's a little bit shit, but that's not your fault
10200080	10206640	Don't worry about it. Uh, thank you for sharing your experience. Um, please share the pictures online on twitter's or something so we can see them
10206640	10210240	Yeah, you know i'll send you a link on facebook or something because that's the only place I have it right now
10210240	10213280	And I would like to see the bootlegs. I'd like to see the bootlegs very much
10213920	10220080	13 minutes. It's long. That's all right. It's okay. Cool. All right. All right, send it on over take
10221120	10225680	Take care. I think we're breaking up. Have a good one. Good night. Thank you. Bye. Bye
10226800	10231440	All right bummer about the connection, but hey it happens. What can you do? All right
10231520	10234960	Um, let's see if I can wrap up these twitter topics. I'm gonna go ahead and close skype for the night
10234960	10238080	Thank you guys so much for calling in. I really appreciate it
10238320	10243440	Sorry to those that didn't get through but uh, try again next week or of course you can always send us an email
10243920	10247060	Again, that's mailbag at orange lounge radio.com
10249120	10252080	Uh, oh shit, I was actually out of tweets. I guess I could do one more
10252160	10254560	I'll let tiger claw have one more because this is pretty good
10255040	10258160	Uh, so we'll do this other link from tiger claw here who sent us a link
10258700	10263520	Retired nfl players are getting the green light for a lawsuit against ea
10263520	10264560	Okay
10264560	10269520	Maybe you didn't hear but retired nfl players actually filed a lawsuit against ea
10270160	10273120	a california judge rejected ea's, uh
10273680	10280960	Case to have the whole thing dismissed. Um, they want to turn this into a class action lawsuit. So six thousand
10281760	10289700	Various retired players can be represented the alleged lawsuit here is that ea through ea sports brand used the likenesses
10289700	10294420	Without consent in multiple madden nfl games over the years
10294820	10299860	Ea says it was basically fair use and real names were never used
10300500	10301700	hmm
10301700	10307860	Uh ea's madden games though. They have a lot of historic teams that use stats attributes and other factors for fantasy players
10308180	10312820	They're close to the real life counterparts, but uh not exact
10313860	10315620	Or so ea claims
10315620	10320980	So I don't play these games. So it's hard for me to take an opinion on this one way or the other
10321300	10326820	But uh, the judge certainly felt they had a case so it could be very interesting to see how this plays out
10328180	10330680	That's it for our tweets tonight twitter.com
10331840	10335780	Olr, but that also brings us to the end of the show
10336500	10340820	Uh, but not before I ask for any last minute stories from loki or dark sakura. I'm good
10340820	10345780	Good meh. All right. Well shit. We're done then we're out. Let's uh do a last minute
10345940	10348340	Uh, let me do my last minute kind of plea here
10348660	10352900	We are of course a free show and uh, we do this every week for nothing
10352900	10356340	We don't charge you guys. We don't have ads in the show or ads on our website
10356660	10360580	All we ask is that you tell a friend or two or 50 about the show
10360980	10367080	Help us spread the word by leaving a nice review on a website such as itunes or wherever you found this podcast
10367080	10374440	Or help tell people and spread the word about olr because you'll help our little olr me grow and we really appreciate it
10375000	10380760	Um, let's go around and get everybody's final thought tonight loki. Why don't you start us off? I think it's ironic that
10381800	10388120	Volition or thq or saints rose, uh, april fool's show was for new new thing a dlc
10388200	10390520	That actually sounded cooler than a dlc that they put out
10390520	10397640	Uh, haha, if joke's on you your dlc sucked and I didn't buy the last two bits of it also read ready player one
10398360	10401080	You can do it. You won't you won't be able to put it down
10402040	10405960	Uh, my final thought for tonight is uh, i'm excited that it's taco night
10406360	10409880	Uh, because it's sure to be better than that shit taco. I had at chevy's on monday
10410040	10414440	Just saying that was a pretty who puts fucking mayonnaise on a taco what?
10415080	10416280	Right
10416280	10421480	Right. It was cilantro mayonnaise is gross hated it
10423000	10425000	Dark sakura, how about your final thought?
10425320	10426200	um
10426200	10428200	I really have to give uh
10429000	10430520	the uh
10430520	10432520	April fool's award to uh google
10433320	10436920	For google quest. Yeah, we didn't even bring that up tonight, but that was amazing
10437160	10441160	That was great. And I love the little commercial blowing in the cartridge and everything
10441160	10448680	I loved the easter eggs of like the little landmarks being and there's a whole list on reddit of like all the different
10448760	10450760	Hidden landmarks. It's great
10451160	10455720	I loved it. They used all the dragon quest art in it. Yeah, it was awesome and um
10456840	10458840	the youtube collection
10459240	10461240	Oh, yes, I saw that. That was great
10461960	10465400	All right. Well, that's it guys. Thank you so much for tuning in to orange laundry
10465400	10469400	We'll be back another week and next week. It won't be april fools anymore
10469400	10471400	So it'll be a little more serious
10471960	10475000	But uh, we can still be a little silly tonight, right?

10515500	10519900	Somebody once told me what having a baby felt like giving birth sucks and i'm never going to do it
10519900	10524940	Wait, that's why they cut open your stomach and pull the damn kid out. It's just like what the hell's the point?
10524940	10529420	It's like trying to shove a piano through a door when there's a perfectly good window right there
10533180	10535100	I mean
