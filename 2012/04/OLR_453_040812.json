Fuck yes! Aww, but you guys More like Brorange Lounge Radio, right? I don't want you guys to feel like it's the weird show I mean obviously Jason, you've been our webmaster for years and years And you played Bamani games just like Dark Sakura, Loki and I did Just at a different arcade So I know you followed that scene probably longer than we did But you were in all that stuff And Alan, well Alan's cool too Right Alright, before we get into How Was Your Gaming Week and all that tonight I thought we could talk a little bit about not just the weird oddities Of having only one of the regular hosts here But I mentioned next week we were going to not be here Because I have a pre-planned trip We're going to Disneyland, which I know shock and awe, dying of shock Alan's coming with me of course because he does that And we're going to the final ever electronica But for those who didn't know, they turned California Adventure into Like this whole, they turned a part of it, not the whole damn park But they turned a little part of it into The Grid on like Friday and Saturday nights And they did this back when the Tron Legacy movie first came out in theaters And it got extended several times I think it was only supposed to run for about 6 months the first time It's been extended to like 18 months or even longer now It's been about a year and a half since that movie came out But one of the other cool things, and I know we've talked about it on the show before Is that electronica also has a replica of Flynn's arcade from the movie With classic 80's video games that are in great condition Because you know it's Disneyland, they're not going to let shitty run down games into their park And the one time I have seen a broken machine there They had a dude out there fixing it in like 5 seconds So we're going to go say goodbye to electronica Because you know they made a business decision to get rid of it Because Tron the movie again is a year and a half old now We don't know if they're going to be doing a sequel Although there is the anime that's supposed to be out in summer or fall So it seems weird to me that they're not going to have awareness for that But they're replacing it with the mad tea party And that's tea as in just the letter T Not as in a sippy drink that British people have at lunchtime Where's failed trombone? Do you have it queued up? I can get failed trombone queued up It's too late Why are you And you're upset about the mad tea party Like you're personally offended right We saw that movie and I didn't think it was going to be very good And you were very optimistic It'll be okay it's Tim Burton and it was shitty I didn't like it at all I know some people were into it but no I didn't like it at all But here's the thing and the reason why I bring it up Is that unfortunately with electronica changing over to the mad tea party They're going to close Flynn's arcade Now supposedly the mad hatter is supposed to have some type of arcade But I don't believe that means he's keeping the 80's retro games From what I hear they're supposed to be like skee-ball And it's what happened to every other arcade from the 80's They're now birthday kid palace Where the machines spit tickets and all that stuff Although I heard the mad tea party won't even give you tickets It's just playing skee-ball for the sake of playing skee-ball Which is weird and absurd to me but whatever Disney Imagineers if you want to listen to me for a very awesome idea You should fix the bootsy run down arcade off of space mountain And put Flynn's arcade there And it will be super awesome Exactly and tomorrow lands a great fit for it Or just fucking bulldoze interventions Cause who goes in the interventions building like ever And just make a giant Tron grid It would only cost like $11 billion and it would be amazing But my hope is, here's my secret hope I have a secret wish hope pie in the sky idea And that is that maybe if we go to the last electronica They're going to give away some of the arcade games You get an arcade machine You get an arcade machine Everybody gets an arcade machine In reality that fucking won't happen Because I think they're leasing them from a local company That specializes in this shit But hold on I want my idea I want my pie in the sky idea And that is that they're going to give away these machines So I was thinking about if you could have a retro arcade machine in your house What arcade machine would you want to have in your house If you could have something from Flynn's Arcade in your house What game would you want This is a tough one Cause there's a lot of like great games And part of me wants to say Dig Dug Cause I'm actually pretty good at that one Part of me wants to say BurgerTime Because I damn near bought a- I came so fucking close to buying a BurgerTime machine Like not even a couple months ago And then I realized I live in an apartment And that would be a really shitty idea To bring an arcade machine into the apartment But you saw when I saw that BurgerTime machine Alan right I was like I could forego getting an iPad Your BurgerTime machine And you're just rolling your eyes in the back of your head But I think the machine I would really really want to have I don't know why it's just Is a spy hunter machine Any of the racing games from that era Cause they all had different like variety of pedals Switches, different steering wheels Like All Points Bulletin was actually one of my favorites From that time period Or at least that's how my brain seems to relate it I think I just have a lot of memories of Spy Hunter as a kid Because that's what they had Okay shut up It was at the local roller rink That's where all the arcade games from my youth came from too It was that or the pizza parlor Pizza parlor was like a sit down Either like a joust or a galaga or something like that One of the two sided top sitting It's probably a name for that I don't know what it is So I want a Spy Hunter machine I want Oprah to give me a Spy Hunter machine at the last electronica Jason what arcade machine would you want? You know I had one in mind And then my brain replaced it with Neo Geo So I kind of forgot what it was entirely Not just Light Cycle Tron But one of the I think it was like the Movie Tron arcade machines There were two Tron machines There was Tron It was just called Tron And then there was Discs of Tron And did that have I think there's even a third one Because there should have been one that had like the assault on the MCP and tanks Tron was made up of four mini games And I think you're just thinking they're all separate games Wasn't Tron originally just a Light Cycles game? That's one of the mini games It's just the most popular one There was Light Cycle game There's the MCP cone There's the tanks And there's I would probably say Discs of Tron Discs of Tron I would not mind more time with that game I've only played it like once or twice And it looked really good It was very engaging It was really fun Alan, if you could steal one machine out of Flynn's arcade Or excuse me, have Oprah give you one Gift you one What would you want her to give you? Well I don't think it's in Flynn's arcade But if I had to have a vintage cabinet in my house It would have to be multiplayer And it would have to have large cabinets To set drinks on And I would go with Golden Axe Because that game is amazing I think Golden Axe is better left in my memory Like every time I've played Golden Axe Not to just take a crap on what Alan said Not this shitty port that was on Genesis And is currently on XBLA or whatever But the original arcade Golden Axe With three people It was a good time It was good memories It was good memories God damn that goblin Attack faster, come on Awesome comments from our chat room Chat.orangelaungeradio.com Because everybody's joining in in the chat room Love this DDRdollabill says Robotron2084 would be his game Hands bloody fucking down Brad from Pod Culture Love this answer This is one I would want too Fucking Star Wars the arcade game Good call I completely forgot about that I'm not even like a Star Wars aficionado And all that I mean I like the movies I don't like obsess over them I'm more of a Trekkie than a Warsie But the arcade game Was so fucking good Is that the Vectrex one? Yes Did you know there was an Empire Strikes Back of that? There was I don't remember how official it was But a buddy of mine that has a bunch of arcade machines down in his basement Has it on a little Not a ROM switcher but a cart switcher And I was completely unaware that there was essentially a second Star Wars arcade There was There was It was a little more complicated But yes there was one It was pretty awesome Let's see Tigerclaw on chat says If they did that Meaning handing out the arcade games Rob would scream like a schoolgirl if he won an actual arcade But then he'd be like Wait a minute how am I supposed to get this thing out of here I would tie it to the roof of my Honda I don't even care Go driving down by five Catching all the bugs Jim Sally says Burger Time all the way Burger Time for the win Yeah I was almost there too Stan says Pac-Man but the small table version Where both players sit at opposite ends of each other A cocktail machine Cocktail machine Oh my god I'd love to have a cocktail machine Those are hard to come by though Cocktail machines are really sought after Isn't that new Pac-Man game that came out that was incredibly expensive That's the latest cocktail cabinet It was definitely inspired by cocktail machines Yeah I know it's not Pac-Man Championship Edition But like an arcade Pac-Man Battle Royale I remember it had a funny name And it's in Vegas and like New York and no where else or something My Dave and Busters in Colorado had it It was really fun Rama says Magic Sword Oh good fucking call I love that one That was the one they had at Round Table Pizza That I would just play the shit out of Pork Chop says APB is awesome Brad from Pod Culture also says The original Gauntlet would be hella awesome There's a good multiplayer game too So good calls all around Love the classic arcade game suggestions We're going to be very sad when Electronica closes But our plan There's actually like a group of us going Like I'm meeting up there with some of my friends from Warcraft Nerd nerd Some of my DDR friends from back in the day Mel and Mel Mr. Mel B who was a big DDR freestyler back in the day Is going with us It's going to be good And our plan is to at the end of all of it Yell end of line and then collapse into tears Drunken tears And I want to see Laser Man because I still haven't seen that shit Laser Man will be there from what I understand So there you go Hey Dark Soccer joined our chat room Hello Dark Soccer and said Dave and Busters in Roseville has it So if you want to go play Pac-Man Battle Royale there you go We haven't been there since We haven't been there in a while Yeah I think it's one of those things that's going to become a staple of Dave and Busters Because it's not redemption but it kind of feels like it And it's just a quick engaging game of Pac-Man I'm thinking Dark Soccer should have a local birthday thingy thingy at Dave and Busters Wink wink nudge nudge with her two gay besties If nothing else Should have a Dave and Busters night That would be fun wouldn't it Alan? Yes Alright Anyhow that's enough for our reminiscing and retro arcade games And we will not be here again next week Our pal Bobby Black Wolf who we are usually after At All Games Radio where we do tape live every Sunday night right after his show At 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern He's been off for the past two weeks He will be back next week So at least live folks you have something to look forward to Our 9 cast of course also live on Sunday nights They will still be doing their thing They've been constant over the past few weeks So there will at least be those shows to look forward to but no OLR We'll try to find a best up from the archives for you live folks Maybe a rarity I just came across a stockpile of episodes that aren't even up on the OLR archive So maybe I'll dig one of those up and play that next week It'll be fun Meanwhile let's talk about our gaming weeks And how was your gaming week? I would usually say ladies first but there are no ladies So Alan since you're within kicking range Kick kick go How was your gaming week? I've been playing the Mass Effect trilogy Inspired mostly in part by all of the wank I got mad and bullshit over the ending of Mass Effect 3 I've had the first two games in my steam account thanks to those crazy sales So I was like I'm gonna play these things and hopefully get to 3 at some point if I can buy it So two or three weeks ago I beat Mass Effect 1 on both Paragon and Renegade Which is sort of goody two shoes good guy and asshole good guy And now I'm playing Mass Effect 2 and I'm ready to beat it Like I just started the end game mission that's all very intense The characters die and I had to save and quit to do the show So we are literally taking you away from doing Mass Effect right now Yes but that's all I've been playing for the last week It's probably good to have a break once in a while Microphone extension cords and headphones No we need him to focus He needs to be funny because we don't have Loki or Darth Sock tonight So unless you want to be funny he has to bring the funny Alright so that's it for you Mass Effect, Mass Effect and more Mass Effect Now what are you going to do? Are you going to buy the third game or are you going to try to play the second one over again? Well I'm doing my goody two shoes play through right now So once I beat that then I'll load up my female femshep And she's just like fuck you, fuck you, kill everybody and save the universe And I don't give a shit because that's how she rolls That's another 40 or 50 hours of gameplay DarkSakura sent me her gaming week through proxy and she wants you all to know that she played a shitload of Portal 2 this past week What a shock, yet has she touched that copy of Mass Effect I loaned her? No That's alright, Portal 2 is a pretty kickass game Alright, Jason how was your gaming week? Well as I kind of started to say at the top of the show The first half of the week almost didn't exist for me with trying to get back out here But I did load down my iPad for the train with games and I just kind of picked up some old favorites of mine Death Rally has a modern iOS remake which is really fun I picked that up again and started working through the missions again Jetpack Joyride and then a couple of silly little things like Sudoku type games Pickris type games And I feel like I'm missing something significant but considering that consoles weren't really in the mix I don't think I was Sometimes you have to game on the go Yeah And when you have 33 hours to do nothing but sit there and bounce to the left and to the right and back and forth and stumble through a narrow corridor By which I just mean a train in real life Yes, certainly Go to our chatroom at chat.orangelandtrader.com There's a lot of people talking about Mass Effect and lots of people getting into Mass Effect AcidicVampire says everyone should play the Mass Effect series, end of story A lot of folks saying they got the Steam deals going on there Let's see, Dark Soccer is yelling at me saying girl I'm on my PC unless somebody wants to buy me Mass Effect 1 on Steam Tigerclaw said I bought Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2 for $3.60 but you may want to wait until BioWare releases the patch that will fix the face import bug Which is set to be released next week Which is great because I won't get to Mass Effect 3 before next week so I will never have known that that was ever a problem I just had someone on my Facebook a couple hours ago post that they finally beat Mass Effect 3 And of course they've already had the perspective of all the wank about the ending for the last two weeks To I guess if they wanted to be pretentious and rise above that And they said I have a lot of questions and it's not confusing at all and it's not really wrapped up into a neat little bow but they were satisfied with it So they were like I don't get it, I don't get the rage I heard it's one of those endings that makes you madder the more you think about it So like maybe he's not mad today but next week he'll be like raging internet angry Or 3am WAIT WHAT Waking up in a cold sweat DAMN YOU I'm prepared to be let down by the ending of Mass Effect 3 but just the adventure from Mass Effect 1 and even I'm about halfway through Mass Effect 2 right now Well I don't want to say 2 is so much better because 1 was awesome but if the last 20 minutes of the endgame rashetty for the whole trilogy That franchise in my opinion has given me at least 100 hours of quality emotional rewarding gameplay So it's not a waste of time And of course there's going to be more DLC some of which obviously will come up a little later in the show when we get to news So let's see my gaming week so Mass Effect for me as well just like Alan I got sucked into Mass Effect amongst all the chatter of Mass Effect 3 And Shane basically bullied me into playing Mass Effect like basically would threaten to kick me out of the WoW guild if I don't start playing Mass Effect or something like that So I've been playing it, it's been amazing as I've talked about in previous weeks on the show I'm just still cleaning up the loyalty missions and getting ready, I gotta catch up to where Alan's at I have been playing a few other games though I want to tell you guys about, one of them is old and one of them is very new The old one I want to talk about tonight is a game I got for $15 at Target it was on clearance I might be partially responsible for this Yes you were kind of an enabler you were like hey you should get this it's $15 and it has dance in it you'll like it And I pick up the box and I'm like I think I heard about this game and I heard it was really basic And I looked at the song list I'm like well if it's basic it still has a really great song list so I pick up a game called Dance Paradise Which was $15 which was one of the early Kinect games Is that THQ or Ubisoft? I want to say it's THQ that did this one Here's the thing Dance Paradise it has a really good song list It's got like Lady Gaga it's kind of a euro infused song list it's like songs I think that were bigger a little bit bigger on the other side of the pond Because you got things like Jerry Halliwell and nobody cared about the Spice Girls in America once they split up But you know you got Lady Gaga you got a few Rihanna it's basically gay bar in a box right And you know it's going to be good music because it's gay bar in a box and it's a great song list don't get me wrong And it's also really cool because you get the little music videos actually play in the background while you're playing which not every game has That was pretty cool but it's just it was so fucking basic like I don't know how else to describe this game Like and the way you play it is really stupid like Because you have to take a you start in the center and then to do a certain dance move you have to take a step to the left to do it And then a step to the right and it's not the time warp Yes exactly you jump to the left and step to the right but it's like Lady Gaga you're dancing to Imagine it looks like rock band where you have like the four columns that notes fall down Well you have to literally walk into each column in order to do the move and instead of falling notes you have falling dance moves So maybe you're like doing a little disco or you're opening your arms back and forth or you know kind of a lot of the same stuff you see in Dance Central But the fact that you move back for like who designed that that's just like that's not even that it's so weird For those who play connect in a loft giant warehouse floor for all the room you need to play it But here's the other thing that kind of disappointed me is that there was a good game in there somewhere Because one of the things that was really cool about it was that some of the moves that you did mimicked the dance moves in the video And I thought well that's that's a good thing to see in a music game is like learn to do the dance from the video that was really cool Because Dance Central doesn't really even do that right and that's the king of the crop You might see some like you'll definitely see like like for um oh There's a little bit of booty and baby got back Yeah there's that and then what the hell's that oh what's the goblin male dance what's that Soulja Boy tell us Soulja Boy okay thank you isn't it sad that that's how we communicate We have problems And unfortunately I know wow just enough to understand that too now Okay Soulja Boy you do that dance in Dance Central so some of the big ones are there But it doesn't like match the music video because Dance Central doesn't have the music videos And Dance Central is still a lot of fun I mean it doesn't really matter It kind of bothers me that like you have you have really good licenses and a really kick-ass song list in Dance Paradise And then what was the other big competitor to Dance Central that came out Dance Masters Dance Masters the Konami game Dance Masters is actually beautifully put together if you think about it It's just para para of Kinect right Or even not not exactly there are three or four there are three or four Wow There are three or four songs on the list that are Eurobeat and do have para para routines But everything else to the extent of my knowledge completely original But it really is like fully fledged dance minus walking around a stage because Kinect is narrow tracking A lot of them were like crossovers from DDR though they had a lot of DDR crossovers Oh yeah everything was Konami original period But the ones that weren't para para were very the routines were actually well they were fun to watch Because I haven't exactly learned them yet but they were fun to watch But there was some really weird weird crossovers though because like I remember one of the songs was Exotic Ethnic Which I was trying to find in my my archive here but it's like it's not really a song you can dance to I mean it's a DDR song it's a great DDR song because the way DDR structured But now that we're kind of beyond the dance pad and in the whole like free movement Exotic Ethnic doesn't make a very good dancey song The routine from what I recall the little bits and pieces it like the song the song on DDR was like 200 beats per minute I found it here we go so you can kind of see what this looks like here and hear this song and like see the routine And realize it doesn't really work very well What is up with the backup dancers this is like pg-13 here look at this But anyway it's not a very like it's a good song like it was great back in the DDR days But like to like freestyle move it's weird and it doesn't really like make sense So here's the thing you've got a great interface and a great shell not even just dance masters But say rhythm party right the game that just came out on Xbox Live Arcade But not even the Bimani community seems to care about at this point It's actually a really well put together game and I've said that for weeks on the show There's a Bimani community Yeah well you know what I mean I think there's a Bimani community What's left of it? What's left of it? So you've got that and then you have to it's like they need to learn something from each other If you had rhythm party with Dance Paradise's song list you would have an amazing music game Or if you had you know something that if Konami would just take the risk and license more than literally three licensed songs Or if you know THQ would take the risk and spend a little more time designing a game that people actually want to play And not just relying on the music to sell your game If they would both take that risk there could be a legit competitor to Dance Central which kind of has both But unfortunately both of them are looking to cash in a lot cheaper and don't want to take that financial risk which I can understand Konami a lot of these a lot of these companies that are producing these are when it comes to music and rhythm In my opinion they're mostly all on like the second tier And Konami as far as American and European releases minus DDR has pretty much become that Has gotten to that has driven themselves down to that point as well Oh yeah Notably starting with Rock Revolution Harmonix is now the top tier Harmonix is absolutely the top tier and Konami is now under them Absolutely I would sign on to that It's too bad but there you go Anyhow so that was my big bloated Dance Paradise of a year and a half old game Dance Paradise there you go And that was your gaming week One other game I'm sorry I have to say it quickly quickly there's a new pinball game that came out on Xbox Live Arcade And I don't even remember the name of it it's just called like pinball I think Arcade pinball or something Here's the thing though it's a bunch of classic tables it's it's the guys that made the like Williams pinball collection And the Stern pinball collection like those games have already been out They just basically ported it to Xbox Live Arcade but I see what they're doing they're piecemealing it Because the game itself comes with four tables It's four damn good tables it's Ripley's Believe It or Not which is a great table Arabian Nights and Theater of Magic and Black Hole are all great tables So it's like 800 Microsoft points for four like killer tables and then they're gonna do DLC later like Pinbot The thing that they have that Pinball FX doesn't have is licenses They're licensed with Stern and Williams so they're gonna get all those tables into their game But if you already own the collections that came out on Xbox previously I don't see the reason to get this whatsoever But for those that missed it and want their game a little cheaper and more piecemeal If you like pinball there's some great tables in there And I don't remember Theater of Magic being in the collection so it's pretty cool that at least that game is there Or if you're named Dark Soccer and just have all the tables in your house anyways This may also not be for you as cheap as it as it is by comparison Well I want to say Ripley's Believe It or Not was one of their like sought after tables that they wanted So they can do a virtual version of it on the Xbox 360 Pinball Arcade says Zethur in the chatroom at chat.orangesauceradio.com I knew it had a very very basic name to it so Pinball Arcade that's the name of it Medieval Madness is DLC says Zethur and I know I saw Pinbot in the list which is one of my favorites And you know they'll kind of do that so you know Pinball FX I like it a lot It's got some great original tables I'm glad to see there's a little healthy competition now with both of them being out there And especially if you're a pinball fan it's a win-win situation So you know if you somehow missed the collection last time this is definitely worth checking out Alright now I'm done with my gaming week Housekeeping check us out on Twitter twitter.com slash o-l-r Of course always our website orangesauceradio.com If you want to find more of the OL Army members check it out in the upper right hand corner At orangesauceradio.com there's a box called Extended Play where you can find us on Steam You can find us at Last.fm Lots of places to play with other cool folks who are not going to be a jerk Because you know the number one rule of the OL Army is don't be a dick Because there's so many dicks ruining the game experience on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network We want to be different than that There you go Alright let's get into some actual gaming news Jason why don't you start us off tonight Harmonix has come full circle once again and is returning to its roots of a frequency amplitude inspired type of game Again taken from the Rock Band franchise that they've been so excellent with over the past 5 years? 6 years? I actually don't even know what year they really started with it anymore They're returning to a frequency style layout with some very notable differences There was a very famous point in amplitude and frequencies history where you could learn the exact track that you have to make to get the absolute max score And Harmonix has responded to this by making Rock Band Blitz a slightly simpler game One track per instrument and it was either 2 or 3 targets per instrument I forget which But the power ups aren't as track specific, the video is talking about a multi-measure automatic note auto player And then there was like a wrecking ball that kind of bounced around tracks in a diagonal manner picking up notes along the way And there's also no concept of a combo that you have to continually go on one measure to the next to extend the combo And you can actually just jump from instrument to instrument and apparently it'll go a long way towards making a slightly unique sound A slightly unique emphasis or you could just sit on your favorite instrument and play it the whole night It sounds like it's going to use your entire back catalog so if you've been playing since Rock Band and you've imported everything from game to game Plus all the DLC that you bought, all the Rock Band Network and what was the indie version of Rock Band Network? That is Rock Band Network, yeah Rock Band Store is the license, you know all that stuff It's sounding like you should be able to have all of your official and indie content No specific pricing and no specific import restrictions due out just yet but the game looks fun and it's always nice coming back to this style I had a lot of fun with Rock Band Unplugged as well It's interesting like I was partially really excited by the news, I have to admit a hint of disappointment Because knowing that like this is the big project Harmonics has been working on I have to express a teeny bit of disappointment because I was like oh I was kind of hoping for something new But okay I mean it's really fucking hard to be disappointed when this sounds like a real powerhouse of a game And the fact that it imports everything that's already on your drive, that's huge What other company even keeps all your stuff like that anymore? Exactly, like seriously what other company is going to give you that type of value? Does EA own Harmonics at this point? No they don't, Harmonics is independent They bought themselves out from MTV I was like surely this is not behavior coming out of EA Well that just proves Harmonics is independent So yeah they're truly independent because they came off the MTV games, that was where they were at when Rock Band started But just the value they're giving you there, it's so amazing coming off the weeks of us talking about how developers want to lock you out of used games altogether Now it's like here's a game that enhances the value of all the DLC you've already bought Like well fucking done, applause This is, I mean I feel like an asshole for saying that I even expressed a hint of disappointment at this game I'll definitely be picking it up day one, I mean now that I see kind of all the pieces and I'm like okay I did like amplitude and frequency a lot, people did say they wanted a new frequency and amplitude Even though this isn't really it, it's what they could get away with doing and know that it's going to be profitable And so I'm excited for it, I am I mean the way that I look at it is that we had the simple arcade style band I'm trying to avoid the word simulation because the point is we had the arcade style music experience And that was literally with like Guitar Freaks Dramania, the early Konami games And then Guitar Hero came around, put it solely on the guitar And then Rock Band came around and gave us the whole band And then Rock Band 3 came around which gave us the pro controllers and everything else Where you can use a no kidding digital drum kit and have an actual performing gear that you can actually plug in and use with the game What else are they going to add into the Rock Band franchise that isn't going to be tacky as hell And so instead to kind of go off the beaten path, whether they do something new which is hit or miss Or they use this engine that was really fun and have all of your content like you just said That's not a bad decision I mean fucking how many songs have I bought on Rock Band It is disgusting how much DLC I have on my Xbox 360 You're going to buy either a $30 or $40 game and you're going to import what $200 in content automatically Rock Band Blitz is on Xbox Live Arcade, it's at most going to be $20 So maybe even $10 Probably less than $20 Well with 25 licensed songs or whatever it is they're doing That in turn are going to play in Rock Band 3 Amazing! We love you Harmonix Who else is doing this? You remember? Okay remember like three years ago before Rock Band 3 came out And they were talking about the Rock Band store They were talking about how they wanted Rock Band to be like iTunes Like it's iTunes for your consoles And a lot of us kind of laughed it off and said oh yeah you're doing music You're not the same as iTunes iTunes is for your iPod And downloading a song into Rock Band is not the same as iTunes But now here we are years later That's what they were setting the seeds for Because now they've enhanced You didn't just buy Rock Band DLC You bought a song that functions in multiple ways on your console That is starting to feel a little more like iTunes for your console, that's amazing So like I said it's hard to be that upset And deep down inside I kind of think Rock Band Blitz is more of probably a side project To something that's you know Something that's really going on I bet there's something else I mean there was the iPhone stuff too They had the vid rhythm or whatever that was called The sampler video plus audio Yeah the experimental thing And maybe there'll be something else at E3 this year Because they've announced this in time for PAX obviously And you know we're showing it on the floor there Maybe they've got something else to show at E3 Maybe they're working on something for the next wave of consoles Maybe it's something for the Wii U, who knows So again my disappointment is like one grain of sand In a oh my god I can't wait to eat this delicious cake It's gonna be amazing And actually if anybody's interested I believe they're based out of Massachusetts When I was job hunting a couple people pushed me in their direction But I didn't really want to relocate But if you are willing to and you're interested They actually had a lot of positions available Anything from creative to programming to design I think even like program management that kind of stuff If you're interested look them up That's all I have to say As Rob stuffs his face full of popcorn Dead air I thought I had a break to eat Bad co-host It's alright you're learning Learning You have to learn how to fill in those gaps So I can be a fat ass You'll get there Alright anyhow Well let me ask Alan you've been awfully quiet on that story I mean I know you're not like as huge in the music games as the rest of us But surely that whole enhanced value thing is kind of making you go hmm Yeah I've kind of been abstaining because Rock band and that whole genre Guitar Hero I never really Was into it at all But it sounds like what they're doing with this new Blitz game is amazing so You don't like watching your friends get drunk and sing Lady Gaga and make asses out of themselves? Eh You could get that before there was rock band I don't have a smart phone with a camera to put it on Facebook so If I can't blackmail you then Then where's the fun in that Alright well another game was announced just this past week It's a game It's a reimagining of an old game We've seen a few of these lately WayForward the company that brought us What the hell did they bring? There was another God dammit they did blood rain I think blood rain betrayal was one of their games they did There's another one I was trying to think of They are now taking over the Double Dragon franchise I had no idea that it was up for grabs But it makes sense Majesco was the ones that got the Double Dragon franchise Who had it before? I'm trying to remember Trade West Maybe Midway had it and it was one of the things that went under When they went under But Majesco got the Double Dragon franchise So it's being reinvented as Double Dragon Neon Which is going to come out on Xbox Live And Playstation Network Why did they call it Double Dragon Neon? Well because it is 80's-tastic The colors The colors are the best around Hopefully that can be in the game But I don't know. There is a trailer Let me play some of this for you Because it does have some nice remix music And you can notice The way the characters move Is very fluid and all that You know it looks really nice In HD Yeah that is pretty Beyond pastel-tastic Yeah and everybody is very 80-infused Like you see the afros And the leather jackets And the boots with the fur on them and all that stuff You know call me crazy Or call me stupid if this already happened But you know what I'd love to see a Very modern remake of in this style Captain America and the Avengers Well especially when there is the movie and everything But I think they did another game for that Here is my concern with Double Dragon Neon Okay I bought Double Dragon When it was available on Xbox Live Arcade It is not available anymore obviously But it was available on Xbox Live Arcade for a short time When you know other people had the license We played it together and we did We did And then Darkstakers Dan yelled at us for trashing it I remember that Yes because we played through it and we were like This game isn't very good What the hell were we smoking when we were 12 This game sucks And now I'm looking at this going It looks like it's a faithful port Of the original Double Dragon game But Double Dragon Maybe I'm just old but it kind of gets old After the first stage You're like punch punch Kick kick kick and I'm over it What Double Dragon Founded Final Fight made better And I'd rather play that But even playing Final Fight now Playing any of those old fighting games just doesn't feel the same Better dudes They're all the same It would be cool if they could incorporate some of what we see In new fighting games a little bit Maybe more like versus And special moves and combo attacks Oh god Don't give them ideas But I will I'll at least check out the demo So that's coming out this summer So what you're saying is You want them to bring back that mode from Tekken Tag Tournament Actually that mode kicked ass So yes I want them to bring that back It was a little bit more fun Because there was the entire moveset And a little bit more depth to a side scroller And you could play it as panda And the concept of a fighting game where a panda bear Beats up everyone Is pretty fucking awesome you have to admit I think they brought that out it's just not a side scroller Oh right! Wow did Panda kills everyone Anyhow Wow reference number 5 today Keep that number going Yeah sorry Sorry guys So for Pokemon fans and SRPG fans Nintendo of America Is bringing Pokemon And Nobunaga's Ambition What? Nobunaga's Ambition Nobunaga Cowabunga Cowabunga? They're bringing that to the US Called Pokemon Conquest And it's coming out on June 18th And you play a warlord Who has a Pokemon PAL and you have to build up your army And it's skirmish based and it's an SRPG And if you follow import games And You're a fan of Nobunaga's Ambition This is great You know I remember when I heard That this game was coming out in Japan Like what a weird fucking idea And to hear that this game Is actually coming out here I have mixed emotions Look I get it Pokemon has it's rabid fan base That will buy almost anything that ties into Pokemon Like I'm totally Like I understand that fine But how on earth Does the US get Pokemon and Nobunaga's Ambition Relatively close to the Japanese release You know within a year yes I would call close To this yet we had to pull Out fucking teeth to get Xenoblade Is this an Example of maybe I mean I guess technically it wasn't A Nintendo game because Tecmo designed it Maybe that's the key difference Because Pokemon just shits Money and it's the Pokemon factor I mean it's Even if the whole feudal warlord fails To grab onto people it can still be Propped up and kept afloat At least a little bit more with something like Oh I don't know a Pokemon franchise Which is insanely popular As opposed to a I'm not going to say an underground favorite But definitely a less trafficked Series in the Zen of Years Zen of Sagas and of course Why? I understand why they changed the name Because you don't exactly have your Raving Nobunaga Ambition fans here In the US I mean there was that They had like a few of them on the NES Like Nobunaga and Romance of the Three Kingdoms and some of that but That series has kind of been deader than dead here For years or at least I think it exists on the PC it definitely has like a cult Following but nothing mainstream So I get why they Changed the name but you know there's going to be those purists Though there's always some goddamn purist who's Going to be like why couldn't they just call It Pokemon Nobunaga They think it's they dumbed it down for stupid Americans Stupid Americans Get off your goddamn horse They changed it for Americans indeed Yes they did change it for Americans Because we don't have like two New Nobunaga Ambition games coming Out on consoles every year like they do In Japan wake up It's fucking amazing this game Is coming out here in the first place that's basically my point And it sounds like it has six on six Battles and Battle conditions can change on every turn Keeping players on their toes in anticipation Of what will happen next Me me me me me me Fancy pants reading of the quote And this article from Scott Moffett Nintendo of America's executive vice president Of sales and marketing Pokemon fans are always Interested in playing in new Environments and experiencing new Adventures. Pokemon conquest Gives them an entirely new way To enjoy this beloved series With exciting new settings Fierce battles and nearly 200 Pokemon to team up with Read that first phrase again in that quote Real quick.

Pokemon fans will open up their wallets And give us all their- They will buy fucking everything They will buy any fucking thing that we put In front of them and they will like it If this was something that we were That we were you know head over heels Interested in we have a quote For this too Shut up and take my money! Exactly. As I screw up the quote the first time I got it But I know people like that Shane's like that He probably has his pre-order in already Not that there's anything wrong with that Alright let's go on to the next story Was that mine? I'm keeping up I swear. My computer isn't though Um Max Payne is being brought out Again and being adapted to IOS was this one I think this one uh yeah an Android Version is actually gonna come a couple of weeks later The current rumor says that Max Payne for IOS is going to Come out on April 12th I believe that Is Wednesday of this coming week As to Be expected it's gonna- The game is gonna be Scaled down and adapted so that you can get your Bullet time portable on Purely on screen controls no talk About any kind of a controller or anything to do That but you can start diving around And rolling around and uh Falling off the- Oh what was that Scene where you were going in like a drug Crazed and you had that terrible Walkway to navigate against that's gonna be Really really bad with touch controls Most ports are really really bad With touch controls that's what Makes the story interesting because like I- That was the other game I didn't mention in my gaming week is that um Midway read For the 200th time Re-released their whole classic arcade game machine Uh, classic arcade game compilation And I picked it up in all the packs So I have um YARV, Gauntlet, um The sequel to Smash TV, same characters Uh, I completely Forgot what it was called but then most specifically Like my favorite game- Total carnage! Thank you. My favorite game with a Mouthful of popcorn again Total popcorn! Like I- Like I was Just saying one of my favorite classic games in the arcade Was All Points Bulletin and that is In this collection but it uses It uses the accelerometer Or the dryer or one of the two and it uses You have to tilt the phone to steer And that- That sucks! It's like I would have been less torn up if there Was an optional D-pad but the fact That it's purely tilt is just a pain in the ass Yeah that's the- I think I have that same one It's the like Williams collection or something it's called I thought it was Midway specifically It's only on my iPad it's over in the other room I have it it's called Midway Arcade it looks just like that right? Okay I have it too and Spy Hunter Speaking of that game is in the- Playing that on the train too And it fucking sucks Yep Like that's not how I want to play the game Hey look there's the fork in the road Let me get off to the left. No why are you going to the right? No, no I said to Crash! There are- Okay there are Two games that are actually Three games that are tolerable in that collection One of them is Joust Because think about it In Joust you didn't have up or down You had left, right, and flap So that works okay because There's only so many buttons you can- You're not going to like Accidentally screw up and hit up left when you meant to hit Just left because you have a fat thumb Or any of that right? There's left, right, and flap So Joust works surprisingly alright The other two are Ski Ball And that- Basketball or- Dumb little Basketball game Which aren't even fucking Midway games they're just But you still get tickets from them Exactly! You can get the virtual Prizes from the prize stand You know what I've learned to do to get virtual tickets Here's your players tip for Midway Arcade Just fucking sit there and start Ski Ball And go, just swipe your finger Nine times really fast, restart Nine times really fast, restart I managed to get a 900 game within about Five or six times of trying There you go. So Max Payne this week Android about a week and a half later And everything else Touch world is okay, moving on Can I ask this real quick before we get into the Next story? Ridgey you wanna say something? No. Oh okay. Um Did you hear the news around the internet this week About how Instagram came out for Android? Mhmm And was suddenly bashed by All the iPhone users everywhere that was like Ugh I can't believe Instagram is slumming It up on Android Hipstergram is now Losergram Ugh They need to come out with something new on the iPhone Because I refuse to use an App that exists on Android What the fuck is up with that attitude? Like I don't, where does that come from? All the same holy wars that divide Them in the first place. The same brainwashing That has them upgrade a personal appliance Every fucking nine months for $500 And they see nothing wrong with that Same attitude. I'm gonna club You with my iPhone if you keep talking I'll help But I'm not like that I think everybody, I love it When Android users get the same apps Because sometimes we can still like play together And stuff. I'm totally fine with Android users having the apps All my Android buddies have all the same Words with friends hanging with friends I'm sorry I haven't joined the Zynga must die petition completely yet I haven't started draw something For that reason but I still play words with friends Hanging with friends and scramble with friends It's alright I'll just judge you from back here Exactly. All the way across the table give that Evil glare for the rest of the show He still gives money to Zynga I would ask Jason to host the show again But he fucking plays Zynga games Like he's so not cool And then there are some other games we've Played like there was, I can't even Recall the name of it but there was some pool simulator That had like 8 ball 9 ball and Different table arrangements and that kind of stuff And yeah those are all cross platform And since they're asynchronous And just alternating they work Very well. They're very nice and they get everybody Involved. Okay going to our chatroom at Cat.orangeslaungeradio.com. Tigerclaw says Sky it's Apple fanboys They are elitists. No they're not I'm an Apple Fanboy and I'm the guy that buys The iPhone every time. And your desktop is a Windows machine I'm by I'm by Alan I have to tell you something I'm by. Computeral By portable. And you have the sense to Skip a release before you Upgrade. Yeah alright So dig yourself out of that hole Although also recall One of the first couple of words out of my mouth After I walked in here last time Wow I'm in Windows world. This feels Weird. Okay then fanboy Do you consider, you're worse than I am clearly Do you consider yourself an elitist? You have to think about this. I can't I can talk like it. I don't mean it I mean when I was When I had my whole phone switching debacle I actively looked at what Sprint Had offerings for both Android and Windows And because I had an iPad I was more than willing to get a different Phone because I still had something to let Me get done with the tools that I wanted to use But Sprint's selection was fucking garbage And they have the 4S so I was like okay I'm done I figured it out And that's the story of how I have the Latest phone. There you go Alright let's Let's go. It's not the Apple Show. Let's move on to this story. That's my Other show that I do. Oh that's Right. You really do have an Apple Show. I do. I should let you guys plug your Podcast because he has one too. I'll let you Do that at the start of the next half of the Show. Alright for now Let's talk about the Wii U And a rumor about the Wii U And usually I don't like to talk about rumors Like these but it was kind of a slow news week Because everybody was in Boston with the PAX East Thing. Which by the way we will have some phone calls On that later. But for now We better. Rumors. Yeah we better Because I didn't go this year. I'm kind of sad Some of the other all game shows had it Covered but you know I might go to West Coast This year which is really exciting so We'll hear from the folks That were at PAX East a little later For now let's talk about the Wii U Launch date Rumor spreading around the internet like wildfire We're talking being picked up by Eurogamer GameSpot and so on The rumor is the Wii U Is out November 18th That day sounds awfully familiar That's Five years later isn't it? Didn't the Wii U launch right around that day? Did the Wii U launch? Or did the regular Wii U launch November 18th? I don't remember It was just before Thanksgiving Because it was just before I moved out of Arizona Apparently it's coming from A Japanese retailer email Or something like that is where this date is coming from So you know take it or leave it But November 18th is the day So Here's my honest reaction to that I don't think Nintendo knows the day yet I don't think Nintendo's picked the day yet I think Nintendo in part is Waiting to hear what Microsoft And Sony are doing although I guess they have to Release a date at E3 Maybe they don't have to I want to say they didn't announce the Wii release date till after E3 That year I don't even remember The Wii Came out on November 19th of 2006 Oh so close Well okay at least that shows that They're aiming for the same weekend essentially So I would not put it past a retailer To stub a date based off What they saw before To have some record in their system So they can start saying pre-order Pre-order give us your money Or at least some of it So Yep there you go Another day Wii U What else can you say? Alright moving on So there's been a lot Of anger over Street Fighter X Tekken that Capcom put out A couple weeks ago In regards to all of the Launch day launch week DLC Available That is on the disc that you have to pay to Unlock and I know if Loki were here He would be pitching a fit right now Because this is obviously a thorn in his side There have been a lot of Better business bureau complaints About this and Capcom has finally released a statement It's very Professionally coded And groomed To say We're sorry you feel that way But We didn't do anything wrong Nanny nanny boo boo The first draft of that said fuck you You fucking fucks But that got scrapped Yeah they rubbed it through the PR machine Some bubbles came out Basically they're saying that They make sure that the majority of Content is on the disc There's 38 fighters to play out of the box It doesn't matter if the DLC is available On the day after the release date Or three weeks You still have to pay whatever Five, six bucks, PSN points Xbox Live points To access the content So there's no difference between Content that's on the disc that you have to pay to unlock Versus stuff that's downloaded later And they're saying That the Disc, the product of the game When that has to go gold When they actually say this game is done And then the release date which comes a couple months later Even if that Extra content that comes later still makes it on the disc It's From their point of view It was always Intended to be something Supplementary to the original product And it's not wrong Because Xbox and PSN lets them do this And they're sorry but You have to pay to unlock it either way Whether it's day one or day 22 So What do you think? You personally You're a fighting game fan I know that Given what happened with Street Fighter 4 And Mortal Kombat I basically learned to just say Screw fighting games and wait until two years later Which I know some people in chat are like I don't know the name but They're going to release a comprehensive Game of the year full bullshitty DLC edition I'd rather buy that They have sworn they're not doing it this time Unless you want to get the Vita version Or whatever Then sure, that's what Loki says Get the Vita version You have a Vita, we can get it That was code for Rob, buy it for your Vita And let me play it Let me play it when you're at work I guess it's It's sleazy but like they said It's not wrong You know, I'm playing Mass Effect 2 Which has a lot of Several hour long DLC episode Packs for it, missions with bonus weapons And blah blah blah But the game itself is already so long that you don't You don't really need it And it's just being a completionist and knowing that I want to play Troll Mega Man so bad But I don't have to but I want to And it's on the disc It's frustrating to know that It's right there on the disc but they want you to pay I mean that's the frustrating thing about it At least the Mass Effect 2 stuff you actually download And while there might be seeds of information On the disc, you're still downloading A good chunk of the dialogue and you know All that you're actually downloading You're not able to hack it off the disc In my opinion Capcom may think this is the more convenient Way to do it or whatever but The hacking community is kind of Teaching them a lesson here If you go that route Here's the price you're going to pay for it And it kind of sucks that legitimate users Get screwed in the end And that's where Capcom is starting to look like idiots Like always And on that note, there's actually related news reports Coming out about this About the fact that Capcom has posted I believe it's on their own forums as well as also The official Xbox Live boards Is that they want people to enforce To help enforce against the hackers And report people who are using these Hacked unlocked characters And are using them on online matches They can't do their own fucking job? But if this is the more convenient way to do it Then police it your goddamn self I guess to save themselves a lot of wank From their fans Have it be available on launch day Digitally Do not put that shit on the disc For any reason at all And even if people want to make the argument that Well, it's Tuesday morning and I have the disc And now you're saying there's $40 worth of DLC for me to get Why wasn't it on the disc? They could just say Well, because you have to download it It's not on the disc And that will remove a lot of the argument that the hackers have right now AcidicVampire in our chat room says Ultimately, it's their decision to make it pay to unlock It sucks, but if you want to have it your way You should wait until the final Ultimate Edition Is eventually released Yeah, exactly The vote with your wallet statement Which I think a lot of us are on board with Yeah, I didn't buy it And this is a big part of the reason I didn't buy it Was because Capcom has historically shown That even if they swear up and down They're not going to do it this time I don't believe them I'm not going to buy it until there's the Ultimate Edition Or I'm at least going to wait until the disc is down to like $20 Then I'll buy that And then the $20 to unlock everything That'll be about the game right there, right? This story The hackers, I guess, that have Figured out how to play those Pay to unlock characters online Without having to actually Get the DLC Apparently Jill and Shumagoreth From MVC3 Were on the disc launch day As Pay to unlock characters But they were incomplete assets So to pull down that final 20% That made them playable That was a remote file package That you could bring down to your console Which is probably what they should have done here I'm assuming If they wanted to keep the hackers truly not playing it online Or what have you Let's see Other comments in our chatroom at chat.orangenautry.com Porkchop says Capcom left characters on the disc And the hackers saw it as a personal challenge And they took it, they ran with it And gee What number of times is this that we've heard it? Millionth and a half? Absolutely, well you know the old saying Hackers gonna hack Right? Haters gonna hate and hackers Gonna hack. So when you say Your system is unhackable That is like printing a wedding invitation To all the hackers says you are cordially invited To hack the fuck out of this box Not only did they take the box, but they took the whole damn network And almost the company I mean, what set everybody off about PlayStation when they removed Linux? You wanna piss off a hacker? Take their Linux away? I mean for real Take away their command line Take away their way of exploring And they'll make a new way Brute or not And for people that work in IT That are hardcore crypto people They don't even have to be gamers They see this stuff as a Rubik's Cube It's exactly like you said It's a gauntlet thrown down, it's a challenge Once they release into the crack community Here's how you Unlock this They may not even be gamers, they're just really into crypto And the community is there And they're always gonna find a way around it It is pretty surprising that they're Not only hacking, but they're going activist With it and actually playing these And matches and using it as advertising That's pretty ballsy To go on Xbox Live with your gamer tag And be all, look at me, bitch I know a lot of people that have a lot of safeguards in place That on a console that is hacked Actively prevent them from going on Xbox Live first And nothing goes wrong And then they have to knowingly unlock it And undo any mods or however the process actually works But yeah, this is Probably attributable to the last six months Or so of tech news But they're not only hacking, they're going activist On it as well That's the more interesting story for me personally Interesting Because now people in our chat room are talking About what is likely next And Wylan says, I won't buy Darkstalkers 4 But Stan says, I'll totally Buy Darkstalkers 4 even if there's stupid DLC I've been waiting for that forever Act F says, I'll buy Darkstalkers 4 When the Ultimate Edition comes out This is interesting Have the reputation of fighting games Been tarnished due to not just the behavior Of Capcom, but if you think about it, Mortal Kombat And WB Games Didn't really do anything different, granted they didn't leave it On the disc, but they did release Extra fighters just to turn around This is February or March, they had the comprehensive Freddy Krueger, Scarlet You know, Kenji DLC edition So it's not just Capcom, if you think about it I still stand by my argument That EVO has something to do with the timing And the extensive release And all that kind of stuff I really do feel that that factors in Because fighting games have thankfully stepped back into the mainstream And EVO, if there's something bigger than that I don't know what it is At least here in the States, of course I don't have a specific point That comes off that Ties into all of this Has Namco and Tekken and Soul Calibur Done this shit? I don't think they have They're still the one franchise that's relatively Tarnished Well, Soul Calibur Well, if you had Yoda, you could pay to Get Vader, and if you had Vader Because of the version you bought, you could pay to unlock Yoda But that was really it It was one character, and everyone knew that was gonna happen Well, you know what they're doing now Is it's all the- Yeah, because 5 just came out and I have no idea what they're doing with it They're doing princess packs If you want to dress up your pretty princess In all the gear, you have to download the Costume packs But that's That's still shitty But it's cosmetic Whereas in this, it's players, characters Right, I mean, it's not I think what they're doing is not Nearly as bad as what's happening here Over at Capcom And if you're into the design character stuff Which I know some of our listeners are They sent a bunch of custom characters He made, and a lot of them are just hilarious Like, they're great Real life interpretations made in the game And with even more stuff I can just imagine the additional Opportunities that opens up But that's totally different than You know, a whole different character is here On the disc, you know But I don't think they really had DLC characters, there might have been like One that came with the collector's edition I can't remember The best buy, I want to say The really over the top silly Like vaudeville character I would imagine that after a couple of months he would be made Available for DLC, but there's a precedent For that, that they did with Vader and Yoda Right Alright, let's move on Let's talk about what games are coming out to a retailer Near you that will require you to buy it in the store And then buy all the DLC later Okay, maybe not What's coming out in the US, Jason? Especially considering the selection that I have to work with If these games have DLC that would scare That would scare me to death Pretty light week As far as I see from the next week Three games that I don't know if I should even go on with them But here they are 3DS, Spirit Camera, The Cursed Memoir With bonus Drops on the 13th Oh, that's just a strategy guide Why is that in a game? You fail-tastic Also for the Nintendo DS, Titanic Mystery Maybe with DLC you can Float the ship back up with ping pong balls I solved the mystery It sinks It was Colonel Mustard in the ballroom With the anchor And lastly With the iceberg I don't even remember the blue character's name So there's not even really a way to narrow that down anymore Mrs. Peacock? Yeah, that's not water related at all Oh, okay There was a tie in there somewhere, but I'm not witty enough Speaking of boat sinking, I think that joke just sank To the bottom of the Pacific I'll never let go, Jack I'll never let go We were watching Titan AE last night And the very ending had a very similar situation I'll never let go I'll never let go I'll save you At any rate Lastly, oh, so Titanic Mystery Is... That's not next week, that's two days ago Okay, I apologize, this just failed a lot Spirit camera for the DS Titanic Mystery for the DS 4-in-1 action pack for the PS3 Drops on Tuesday Quiet week An unexciting week Well, let's go to Japan and see if it's any different over there On the 12th in Japan On the Nintendo 3DS Nintendo Sudoku 3D Dai Ni Shu Eitsuno Puzzle Day 1000mon That is, for real, the name of the game It's fucking Sudoku in 3D Okay Like Can somebody explain to me How Sudoku is fucking enhanced in three dimensions? Because you can have a cube instead of just a flat surface No, it's not even that Well, it could be a cube Your brain couldn't fucking handle the Sudoku coob I could do that The Sudoku Sudoku Coos? What? Sudoku Moving on to others That's all that's on the 3DS this week With a title that long I thought it was Sudoku with schoolgirl titties Or whatever Japanese has That would have been far more interesting I would play a Sudoku game if After you beat the puzzle Sexy lady dance, titties in 3D Maybe that's the hidden feature Or you know Guys in their underwear Shaking it in 3D Whatever it is you're into You could have a switch I think you just alienated 80% of the listeners Look, it's like Mass Effect You get a choice You can point the thing up or down If you were worried about tonight being a dry night Dry night How about the Vita? How about it? In Japan this week Rayman Origins And, and ready? Nikolai no Sudoku 5 Shugyoku number 12 Puzzle, that's right It's a Sudoku game on the Vita As well Is that a swastika? What is that? That's one of the puzzles No, that is not a swastika That is not Sudoku It's rotated Look at it diagonally I need the chat Oh, it kind of does look like a swastika Don't buy that game you guys That's not cool It's in chat, tell us we're wrong That is not a Sudoku puzzle, that's the other one What's that? Kakoru? There's the missing number crossword Kakoru or something like that I don't remember the name of it, god dammit How about on the consoles? Maybe there's something to save us on the Playstation 3 this week in Japan Dirt 3 You get Sudoku or Dirt Also Grand Slam Tennis 2 And Rayman Origins On the Playstation 3 And lastly on the Xbox 360 Nothing, because no one owns a 360 in Japan No seriously, there's nothing on the 360 this week in Japan How about Europe? UK All those countries over there Looks like a light week over on the UK side or the Europe side as well On the 11th I have Football Manager handheld for the Android Legend of Grimrock for the PC Skullgirls for Playstation 3 and 360 On the 12th we have Max Payne Mobile, which we just covered Tribes Ascend for the PC On the 13th Fez Fez, not Rez Fez, maybe your little Shriners in the little cars Fez for the 360 On the 14th, Pandora's Tower for the Wii Which is kind of a big deal That's one of those Operation Rainfall games Pandora's Tower? So while we wait here in the US everybody's going to be pirating it Because that's what people do Alright, I'm just kidding kids, don't pirate But seriously Someone on my Facebook just mentioned getting Center Blade Chronicles Like they just bought it in the store this week And I was like, what? Oh yeah I guess we should only really be playing that Starting this week Oops I would have loved to have bought Xenoblade A year ago Nintendo, you've made the bed Now lie in it Moving on, let's do one other Quick story before we get to the classic game of the week DarkSakura's not here tonight I know she's in the chat and she can scream all she wants But we're taking the Classic game of the week car and driving it In another direction tonight, so here we go Jason, one more story though By the way, the chat room Oh there was, hey, look at the main intention Well I'll say this real quick, the chat room is Lighting up, saying there is What we know as a swastika In Japanese can be a manji Which is actually a good luck And some old video games had that For instance there was some Dungeons and Zelda, somebody was saying in our chat room Kind of looked like that I remember it was 1942 and 1943 Had those symbols In the Japanese versions And they were like extra life or something So, and it's not controversial there Because it has a different meaning It looks mirrored to me Yes, I believe it's the other direction But obviously that's a pretty easy mistake For commoners, so generally Games that would have had it and come to America Get it just changed to something else entirely Or just stripped out Was there another comment on that one? No Yes, one last story because I swear I am keeping up with things New York has booted all of its registered sex offenders Off online gaming networks Microsoft, Sony, Blizzard, EA, and Apple All cooperated with the purge Which follows a court case In the state of New York In which a 19 year old pleaded guilty To abusing a 10 year old He met on Xbox Live New York law demands all convicted sex offenders To hand over any email addresses And online aliases To help limit their access on vulnerable web networks However, this is the first time it's ever been invoked In relation to online gaming Pretty, pretty Didn't, we We never went through this Six years ago with Uno And yet we're finally here Oh god, strip Uno, I remember that story Look, here's the thing though Obviously People that would do that stuff to kids Are not okay and they need to be dealt with In ways like this, I get that But, there's another side to this That kind of bothers me What parent was letting their 10 year old Play on Xbox Live unsupervised? Hello Did they just not know What happens on Xbox Live? I'm like, ignorance is not an excuse You know what I mean? That should be a wake up call To parents everywhere You need to supervise children That are going to play games online like that Again, I'm not saying What the 19 year old 19 year old did was right That's no excuse, but I'm just saying There's kind of a couple things wrong in this picture Although, take it on the flip side And I can say something from my youth While I wasn't 10 years old I was still really young And my parents were divorced And I was living with my mom And on the times that she had custody of me And even sometimes when my dad Had custody of us Sometimes it was just myself And my sister who is 3 years older than me But sometimes it was just straight up me Often times, especially after my Sister grew up and moved out It was just myself in the house All weekend This is before the years of online gaming Functionally This is just a modern version of that But these situations And I completely understand Where you're coming from One, there are bad parents Two, there are bad situations with good parents And It would be Great if parental controls Were a lot more perfect If Microsoft could step in a lot better And have some kind of a camera Filter or if they were just kind of smarter about it But these situations happen And it's incredibly unfortunate I can kind of meet you halfway there because When I was probably about 12 or 13 On my Commodore 64 On my 300 baud modem I was calling into BBS's Local bulletin board systems And posting on message boards and playing door games I was fucking playing Legend of the Red Dragon and shit At like 14 and 15 right Which if you ever played those games back in the day Nice games And my mom just said oh he's on the computer You know and I was posting on message boards and stuff And there would be people on the message boards It's like yeah you should like come out to this meetup And all this stuff and it's like okay I'm 15 You know and You know I can kind of see That side of it That sometimes the parents If she knew what I was doing online though She would have punched me in the face She would have taken the cord She would have burned the cord in front of my eyes She knew what kind of stuff I was doing on the computer How does the outside world exist anymore? Especially nowadays With us I mean look at what we're doing here Three nerds around the table and a lot of cords That are just connecting us to the rest of everybody else Did you have a comment on this Alan? I feel that A lot of people Will pretend to be high and mighty by saying that A TV or a console should not be a babysitter But it's A privilege for a kid to have Two adults that are in the same household As them invested in raising them And sometimes if they have to work Full time jobs you know To do what's necessary to run that household A console or a TV will be a babysitter For four or five hours a day And I don't really think that that's negligent to do so And even if the parents Had taken measures to lock down that kind of stuff It doesn't necessarily mean the 10 year old Doesn't know how to crack their parents Password and lock it themselves Like they're not Idiots at 10 I guess that's true you know but Don't fucking buy them an Xbox Live subscription Do not buy a 10 year old an Xbox Live subscription Ever And if you're gonna get one for yourself Password lock it if you know there's a kid in the house It's dangerous Yeah and if the kid still cracks the password There shouldn't be icky 20 plus, 30 plus year old pedos Creeping on them Well that's still absolutely true and I'm still But I'm just saying you know Everybody needs to accept some responsibility here Alright Anyhow let's move on Let's move on to a time when Xbox Live didn't exist and we didn't have these Complicated situations Although the Nintendo Did still babysit us a little bit Or in the case of this week's Classic Game of the Week An old computer would babysit Okay so here's the deal Dark Soccer's not here tonight So this is Dark Soccer's Classic Game of the Week But we're taking over It's my Classic Game of the Week tonight Dark Soccer had picked a game for tonight But I was like, it's a good game, but I'm like She can, I wouldn't want to I wouldn't want to do it without her here Because then she might have things she wants to say about that game So we'll let her roll it over to next week And I'm gonna do a game tonight That I know she would never pick Why? Because I picked a game From the Commodore 64 That's right, the game I've picked tonight Is tonight's Classic Game of the Week is Impossible Mission I don't know if anybody ever remembers this game But this game was awesome Because it was one of the first games ever To use a voice synthesizer And so here you go Here's what you would hear when you would start Impossible Mission Another visitor Stay a while Stay forever That was the shit When I was a kid By the way, he's saying another visitor Another visitor Stay forever The last Metroid Is in captivity The galaxy is at peace It was kind of like that So the original version was on the Commodore 64 And it was done by Epyx in 1984 Epyx was the company that made this game Can we even hear the thing? By the way, the sound effects And stuff in this game is very Ambient There's no music So you just have some very ambient noises If you want to jump a little bit there Alright, so anyway, here is the deal In Impossible Mission Not to be confused with Mission Impossible Wink Wink Nudge Nudge The big show from the 60s Impossible Mission, you played a secret agent Not to be confused with 007 That is trying to stop an evil genius Elvin Atombender Is tampering with National security computers So you go into the stronghold And you race against the clock Which in turn will make a password While you avoid deadly Electrocuting face eating robots Ok, they don't eat your face But they will electrocute you And you will sometimes fall Down bottomless pits and all you'll hear is Ahhhh Anyhow We've got the chorus going on now Once you finally put the password pieces together You'll put the completed password in the main Control room door, and that's where you find the evil professor. Where do you find password pieces? In the furniture of course. You search the furniture in the rooms you might find lift resets and snoozes in the rooms as well. You also will have a room where you can get more lift resets and snoozes from doing a musical puzzle. There you go. Everything in this game was randomized which kind of made this a lot of fun because you could play it over and over again. Sometimes you would have layouts of the mansion or the stronghold that like were not winnable. But most of the time you got winnable and sometimes you get really easy one too. Rogue apparently was an early inspiration for the randomized room layouts. The designer cited rogue. Do you remember the old old ass rogue game that was on like terminals? I don't know that I've originally I've played an original rogue but I've played a million roguelikes. Oh yeah well then you kind of know what the deal is there. Here is the speech that is in the game. There is the death scream which can also be heard in Beachhead 2. They recycled the death scream. There's another visitor stay a while stay forever and then there's also destroy him my robots. Which happens in the very first room you walk into a never again correct? It's a randomized room. Really? And then there's also when the game is over there's a laugh and then if you find him he'll say no no no and then there's a lady voice that says mission accomplished congratulations and that's all the speech in the game that's all you can fit on one of those freaking five and a quarter floppy disks that is like bigger than terabyte hard drives these days. There were only two types of enemies and impossible missions there were the laser spout and robots and then there was also some some would move slow some would move fast and then there's also other types of security guards that would kind of just stay in place and then it would wake up when you got really close to it there. You get six hours to beat the game 36 puzzle pieces every time you die ten minutes are deducted from the total time. This game was ported like mad. It was on the Apple 2, the Atari 7800, the ZX Spectrum, the Acorn Electron, the BBC Micro, the Amstrad CPC, the NES, and the Sega Master System. Not all of them had speech though. Get this the 7800 version on the NTSC platforms had a bug that made the game impossible to win. So it really was impossible mission somebody took the game name to literally there. Looks like level 30 syndrome started a bit earlier than we thought. Aha there was a sequel called impossible mission 2 in 1988 with new traps and items and also a bigger stronghold. There was a 3d sequel planned for Epyx's handy system. I don't know if you guys know but Epyx was going to launch their own system. It eventually became the Atari Lynx so that didn't happen. Impossible mission 2025 came out in 1994 for the Amiga which was kind of the similar gameplay. Impossible mission did show up later in 2004 it was on the Commodore 64 direct-to-tv and it was on the Nintendo Game Boy Advance in 2004 and the Sony PSP in 2008. Get that. This game is also available on the Wii Virtual Console but only in Europe because the Commodore 64 was a fucking huge deal in Europe. It was kind of big here but it was huge in Europe April 11 2008 is when it came out there. This is one of those games that this is the game in my opinion and I'm obviously very age biased myself in that it's gotten better with time because when I was young playing on a Commodore 64 I was just like running jumping and collecting these random numbers and other things. You had no idea what the fuck you were doing right? I can ride lifts up and down inside the side and sometimes not even that couldn't always figure it out but now that I've grown up and matured I actually understand what's going on and what I have to do and this game is freaking hard but it's a good challenge and it's worth revisiting and finally starting to finally starting to get played again. I have actually I still have not beaten the game to this day but knowing what I have to do going back and doing it with the original Commodore 64 version under emulation I've been making an active an active try to do it and come up short so far but I've still had a lot of fun doing it. Tigercall on our chat room says Sky do you think Impossible Mission could ever get remade? Well I mean I mean we do have the Game Boy and the PSP ones but yeah that the Wii the Wii version and all those modern consoles I I would call it a remake because it's not it's not just like improved graphics a lot of a lot of aspects of the game changed like you don't pick up numbers you pick up puzzle pieces that you have to rotate and put into place that form like a map security code something or other I got pissed off at the game and I stopped playing it it's technically already happened but not in a significant way. I think there would be a brilliant use on like let's say Xbox Live Arcade or PlayStation Network of multiplayer can you imagine if you and three other people all attacked the same Citadel at the same time and like you could maybe see the shadows of the other players as they're exploring and then you know I think this would be a great competitive game especially with the randomization element in it and everything I think for like old-school fans I think there's really something untapped here that the developers didn't do when they made these other ports. For some very obvious reasons perhaps. You should be giving me the rights to do this franchise even though I know nothing about game or programming games I think that wouldn't that be a fantastic game on Xbox Live you could like do multiplayer co-op and competitive you do co-op where you're both collecting puzzle pieces I think this is a great franchise. One person manning the computer and controlling some room elements and the other person swiftly dodging the robots at a moment's notice and scanning scanning the furniture and everything else a lot of potential absolutely. Well there it is your classic game of the week for the Commodore 64 where it all started although it's available in a shitload of systems after that impossible mission Commodore 64 your classic game of the week haha Dark Sakura haha took your other classic game and just threw it out the window now she'll bring it back next week I know she will it's okay considering what the game is it would just float to safety there's your hint for next week all right that's gonna do it for part A of Orange Lounge Radio but don't go anywhere we got plenty more to come in the second half of the show we're gonna talk a little more about PAX East we're expecting to get a phone call a little later in the show we're gonna talk about PAX East with some of the OLR listeners that was there I'm not ignoring PAX East I just I live in California and didn't fly out there this year so I'm sure there's lots that's gonna be said about PAX East we do have more news your FUBU question of the week more phone calls and plenty more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this April the 8th of 2012 with the 453rd episode of our show little weird tonight because we're not missing just one but two co-hosts but we have two fantastic co-hosts sitting in tonight we have Alan of course and Jason filling in that's me I promised you guys could talk about some of your side projects because you guys don't just co-host here but you both now have your own regular podcast that you do Jason we'll start with you you mentioned you do an Apple related thing yeah there's a there's a network of nerd topic goodness called a stack exchange and myself I'm quite personally vested with a couple of others on their Apple topic site called ask different and so myself and two others started up the ask different podcast and we've been going since I want to say last summer but suddenly that feels wrong for some reason but ask different podcast pretty easy to search for ask different comm is the site and there's links to blog chat finding us finding the site itself and all that content pretty simple I'm assuming that's a little pun on the think different yeah and that that's that was that was the name chosen for the site the highest voted name for to actually to actually call this site there there's like I could rant for like 30 minutes on how we came to that name but I'll spare all you guys because it's not the topic and you really do have a great radio voice I'm not just saying that cuz you're here but I mean it's convenient but you do have a great real voice I can only imagine it's the ass different podcast is great so all right not as a exciting and hilarious as the show is at least 99% of the time sometimes we get in a good good pun that's okay this show can be pretty boring too now I'm kidding it shows always amazing always Alan you you now in the time that you have been for your last guest co-hosting on this program you now have your own podcast right I've branched out of the olr network how very dare I how very dare you I'm surprised I'm surprised you were banned from this program actually I just sleep on the couch for a week so pretend you didn't make me do that I am on a podcast called fabulous flames and it is a World of Warcraft podcast maybe I guess a competitor of courthouse yeah I know it's my hair yeah I was invited to be on it because the host was a fan of what I had to say on whorehouse so there's three of us and it's just I guess World of Warcraft from a male point of view I don't really know what the gimmick is but yeah we it's a gay Wow podcast that's what the gimmick is fabulous flames is an actual spell from an encounter from this latest expansion and it's the gay dragon that was originally supposed to sound like Paul in from match game and Blizzard like cut his voice our listeners are listeners are too young to get that reference honey so Blizzard cut his voice acting going no this is not good so we're joking that we're the gay dragons and don't just stand in the flames bask in them so it's it's World of Warcraft discussion and you can find us at fabulous flames on Twitter and fabulous flames calm or on iTunes how very dare you work that tagline so one gay dragons two talking dragons is my lack of Wow biting me somewhere here it's the Twilight dragon twins it's a brother and sister and the brother is on fire so I I've often been obviously I have a side project I do not just orange on studio but I have a podcast about the World of Warcraft called the best little whorehouse in Azeroth and our tagline is it's all things World of Warcraft but never too seriously so you know that's what we've got and I often get asked the question is it weird that you and your boyfriend are on competing podcasts and I'm like no because I support all independent podcasts and that's what I've been preaching on orange launch radio for years so I fucking love it that he's doing his own show it's great I love it no it is it is fabulous flames is still very much on its sea legs we're only on our fourth or fifth episode so we have we have a long way to grow you're still basic bitches but you'll grow I've been I am so rude to the the main host of their sunshine I'm I am such a bitch to him on Twitter but it's fun because you know we're frenemies we're frenemy podcasts is what we call each other and so I've said I I have all these names for fabulous wives I call them the fabulous flops it's my favorite name them so anyhow alright so there you go and honestly I really do I think it's great because it's not like most people I know that listen to podcasts listen at work and they've got plenty of time to listen to plenty of shows and I would rather somebody be listening to an independent podcast then some of that crap that certain websites that won't be named produce honey yeah you try I had to dig in one more come on come on alright anyhow so there you go let's um also I would do shoutouts for PAX East since we're giving other shows shoutouts I do want to say I heard little bits and pieces of what the B team which is one of the other shows on the all games network did they were live at PAX East and did some good shows so check that out I also know electric sistahood which is also on the all games network did a show while they were there I don't think it was live but I think maybe it was I don't remember sorry girls but they did one and it will be on their podcast feed and on the network this week for sure and I think I heard Ranma who calls in this show all the time and we'll be on the show tonight guest it on it so I'm glad to see the all games network big happy family getting together at PAX I will say the one year we did the all games thing at PAX Prime was a great year I mean oh man that was a that was like one of my favorite cons ever was that PAX Prime 2008 when all the all games people were there we were broadcasting it was a great year but I did go to PAX East the first year a couple years ago and had a good time so I was sad I couldn't go this year but you know there's only so much money and you know I I spent a lot of it going to Disneyland what can you do but I am gonna try and go to a PAX Prime this year if nothing else all right I'll advertise real far advertising the all games network never saw that coming well what do you want me to advertise I have no good response tonight I was gonna say something bitchy about one of the corporate networks but I'm not gonna go there and I'm just gonna ask that we go for some rapid-fire news so you know what's funny about that I'm on a loaner laptop right now and I just pulled the power cord out so I can tell you the first story purely from recollection is that Diablo 3 was finally dated for mid May what's the next quest what's the next question for the great dungeon crawl torchlight when is it they haven't said yet soon soon shortly after Diablo 3 which is still soon but not soon enough you want to give me the headlines of the next two because I can hard angle oh what there you go theater rhythm Final Fantasy finally dated for the what is that midsummer July 3rd mm-hmm game was actually completely off my radar but looking at the looking at the screenshots looks fun I did get a particular amount of amusement of the fact that cloud stripes face was completely obscured in the one screenshot I did see by the target exceeding the the the note exceeding the target zone whatever the particular vocabulary is for that and finally Sega says rhythm thief is still happening and that article unfortunately I don't have on the top of my head so while my computer starts back up can somebody saved my poor dead-air ass there was they were on the paxi Sega was at PAX East and there was confirmation that rhythm thief is still happening this is despite all the Sega bad news we had last week rhythm thief was not canceled so it is still happening it's a 3ds rhythm action game featuring people in top hats and ties I guess they're like tap dancing on disco floors there you go all right some other rapid-fire news for you guys fallout the original not the fallout 3 which was still really good but the original original game way back in the day was free I say was because you missed it it was on good old games or gog.com it was earlier this week unfortunately if you're hearing this now though it is no longer free so why am I reporting it because I just wanted you to know what you missed out on free fallout which is a great great PC get your PC gaming fan I know you know yes all serious also it's worth mentioning since we brought up gog they throw a little shade at steam this week they were kind of like you know when you give these games away for such low cost it doesn't really help anyone which I thought was an interesting little dig it helps me I can't imagine I mean EA fucked off and did their origin store because they just want to be elitist and only sell things through their own platform but if a game developer is letting steam sell a five-year-old game for $2.99 I don't think valve is twisting their arm zithers in our chat room talking about the Sega stuff saying I hope to God we get Phantasy Star online to hear if that gets canned I will explode I hear ya that character creator came out this week overseas it's not you know that the game has been announced for the US cross your fingers and your toes we get any three announcement because if you don't hear it at e3 it's probably not happening you know what is happening though a sieve 5 expansion civilization 5 gods and kings it is going to be coming out on June 19 is the release date for that 22nd if you're international there was more information announced about this a game developers conference but in case you forgot 27 new units 13 new buildings 9 new wonders and civilization they're also going to add religion and espionage into the game and some tweaks to diplomacy so hopefully they'll fix some of the balancing issues that they borked in the game to begin with but if any of my sieve friends are listening we're gonna need to get a match going in late June after this comes out because I'm I'm eager to revisit the game again but God you know how the sieve 5 matches will go you started at six o'clock in the evening and then suddenly oh shit it's 2 a.m. and we just discovered railroads another story this week epic games you know epic games they make well you know epic games including unreal and you know the Gears of War here's the deal they have announced sort of that they're doing a PC exclusive project it was mentioned during a PAX East panel the unannounced PC project is under development the plans are to keep the game exclusive to the PC so if you were worried that epic was all about the consoles and I don't know iOS games now because that's the other big thing they did right infinity blade don't worry a PC exclusive title is in the works hmm could be interesting Alan there has been an online petition for the game Dark Souls the sequel to Demon's Souls otherwise known as one of the hardest console games ever this generation the petitions been to bring it on to the PC platform and Atlas has come out and said yes there will be a PC edition of Dark Souls and it's called the Dark Souls prepare to die edition to which anyone that's played the game would say very much yes you will die there was a lot of hype in last few weeks about the game journey I believe it is that sort of has an online element if that's correct Demon's Souls was similar in that when you were fighting in these labyrinths you would fight these ghouls that were actually other players and Demon's Souls has a similar mechanic or sorry Dark Souls has a similar mechanic so yeah it's a very difficult game and it's coming to PC it's one of the few examples of where an online petition was a success it has over 92,000 signatures and it has exclusive bosses to the PC Edition which I'm sure will be just as impossibly hard or even more so so Dark Souls fans on PC you're in luck Skyrim 1.5 patch which I was surprised when I read this story because I've been playing on PC Skyrim 1.5 patch for a couple weeks now is hitting 360 and ps3 this week and it's mostly bug fixes at least two dozen or so bug fixes that were blocking progress on certain quests the big deal though about patch 1.5 Skyrim is that it's it's adding kill moves and kill cinematic like awesome slow-mo bullet cam for projectile weapons like arrows and spells which Skyrim didn't have before and also new kill moves for melee weapons so now not only can you behead people you can fry them you can shoot arrows through their necks and all that other stuff you saw in shaky cam Hunger Games yes they fixed what it looks like when you go underwater and it also looks like they finally fixed the Lydia bug Lydia is the first guard woman that you get and you when you buy a house she if you're wearing an omelet amulet of Mara you should be able to propose to her she's been bugged this whole time since November or whatever so finally they fixed the Lydia bug yes I look for that on Xbox and ps3 this week finally Sonic 4 episode 2 the big 2d HD resurgence of the sonic franchise that kind of came off like a fart in an elevator is getting its episode 2 like everyone's like it sounds so awesome and then it came out and it's no one Kerr it is finally getting its episode 2 and it will likely be the last episode so they are wrapping this up really fast episodic content is the way of the future like we'll give you a part 2 because no one like this shit and we don't want to make it anymore so thanks Gabe Newell PSN version will be released on a May 15th XBL a version of Sonic 4 episode 2 will be the next day May 16th and PC and mobile versions are I guess confirmed but to be announced later all right that's all let's go to the frugal question of the week oh no we won't go to the frugal question of the week well one quick thing I missed in the theater them story if you're at PAX East you can go check out the oh sorry nevermind it's over yeah it was joke may I do the frugal now absolutely every week we ask you guys a question over at Facebook or Google Plus Facebook put together that's Google that's our concern facebook.com slash orange lounge radio if you want to like us over there and Google Plus slash search for orange lounge radio because we don't get short URLs there I'll start with Google Plus tonight because the very first answer on Google Plus I need to read this because it has something very important in it oh I should tell you guys what the question was just like I forgot to tell you what the question was just then I forgot to give a good question earlier in the week so I made it really easy this week I said how was your gaming week shit we all have to say every night how our gaming weeks were the host of the show so why shouldn't the listeners get a shot so how was your gaming week listeners I especially said what game are you into right now that everybody else should be playing so Derek H starts us off on Google Plus and this is worth mentioning he's playing pinball arcade on Xbox Live arcade but everyone should be playing joust on maim as part of the hunt and I totally forgot to mention this I'm so bad and I had like notes to myself to mention this partly because I had no idea this was happening until Monday of last week after last week show but dark Tetsuya who pretty much writes most of the articles in orange launch radio.com at this point it's either him or act after me me publishing episodes of the show and that's it at this point dark Tetsuya is doing a little contest and it's called the hunt and it's based off of the book ready player one where they kind of do something very similar I don't want to go into all the details but he's doing kind of his own spin of the competition called the hunt and it involves classic video games and being able to get scores that are better than what dark Tetsuya gets and he doesn't really try super hard because he makes it you know beatable so right now the contest he's running is joust and if you can beat a score of 39,000 something so I mean 39,800 you take a screen cap of it and either email it to dark Tetsuya or you post it on Twitter and you're gonna get a little copper key and some points that let you into the next round of the competition so joust is the game that they're doing right now I don't know how much longer you have to do it I'm hoping dark Tetsuya will allow a little bit of an extension because if you weren't reading the website you may have missed or seen the Twitter you may

radio calm now Derek H also wants to plug you will die on Xbox Live indie games because I get money when people buy it well played well I see what you did there actually you will die is a fun game though like if you like you know your retro shooters he did a good job I did buy it I bought it like two years ago when it first came out so he's probably long spent the money but I did buy it all right uh pwk responded and said I was at my first packs this weekend congratulations I hope you had fun I want to hear more about it Tony M responded and said this is an oldie but after Atlas recently cut the prices of their PSN downloads I've been playing persona 3 portable it's pretty awesome if you're into JRPGs you know persona is one of the series I hear nothing but good things about but I just I personally haven't sat down and played it myself but like I said the same thing about Mass Effect a few months ago on the show I haven't really played it myself but I hear a lot of people are really into it so persona one of these days I'm gonna sit down and play it maybe that's something you could do after Mass Effect play persona is that a serious interest you at all no you did play it before though didn't I have you don't know three and four for ps2 I think might still be shrink-wrapped on this show all right let's go to Facebook read some of the answers there um lots of replies on Facebook I can't possibly read these all but I do want to thank you guys for taking the time to actually answer these let's see another persona Austin W says right now I'm really into persona 4 on PlayStation 2 anyone who is a fan of JRPGs dungeon crawlers and the social character interaction aspect of games should check it out let's see going to Stan says splitting my time between draw something angry bird space push mo on 3ds and more Soulcalibur 5 online trying to show off my creative souls Chad C responds and says been playing realm of the mad god it's an MMORPG shooter with 85 player groups what free to play on your browser also on steam 35 make download 8-bit graphics perma death kind of sucks when your guy you log 30 plus hours on dies but it's so easy to get into that it won't stop you from playing more what perma death and an MMO that's crazy once you hit level 20 you start gaming gaining fame which allows you to buy keys to unlock more dungeons the final boss is onyx everyone gets teleported to his lair when all quests are completed on your realm and someone kills 2500 mobs the game isn't over when he dies however because you can keep getting gaining fame to unlock harder dungeons and get better loots I don't know this game but it sounds crazy thank you I keep bumping into it but I haven't really taken the plunge myself huh now you knew there were gonna be some people talking about Xenoblade this week so we have Barry M Xenoblade Chronicles on the Wii is an amazing JRPG game much in the vein of Final Fantasy 12 meets my White Knight Chronicles I think that's exactly how I described it when I first reviewed it actually also playing Ragnarok Odyssey on Vita Kid Icarus uprising on 3ds and Tales of Graces F on PlayStation 3 this is a great year for RPG fans Carlos M says I'm halfway through Dragon Age 2 on my 360 and 56 coins and to draw something I'd like that those two games are like on the same level there it's awesome zether simply responds Xenoblade everyone probably knows why and dark soccer would kick me if I didn't say I randomly started playing Portal 2 again I know I know I should be playing Mass Effect yes you should I'm gonna read this comment from unfolded Raptor it's a long one but it's good this past week the blockbuster video in the city I live in was going out of business and had a liquidation sale and had to sell everything so I found a whole bunch of really good PlayStation 3 games for $8 each I ended up buying 15 that I never played yet and probably won't for a while I'm not gonna read all these but like Twisted Metal Demon Souls Deus Ex Bulletstorm there's a ton in here grand total of a hundred and seventy three dollars for those games it's a steal considering at Walmart and even at the evil G the lowest some of these get is around 20 bucks I highly suggest people play Borderlands that they haven't yet it's a ton of fun other than that I've been dedicating myself to Ninja Gaiden 3 and have almost finished it I'm loving that as well and I don't see why all the hate for it sometimes I think that people forget how to have fun pretty similar situation in my neck of the woods and I'm sure many other places people people around work were saying you what if there's any movie you've been wanting for a long time go check out the blockbuster right down the hill cuz uh it'll be gone soon I want a blockbuster to go out of business here California props it up a lot better than some of these more sparse well they all went under already years ago red box took over years ago here there's like only I can only think of like where one blockbuster even is there's one over on Folsom below are that I know I'll keep your eye on it for it to go under well okay I will do that it's right next door to Papa Murphy's so we it's like the only pizza chain I'll eat so anymore so all right there you go that was our frugal question of the week thank you guys for responding sorry I didn't read them all but like that was more that since it was such an easy question there was more there than like ever before so let's move on Jason more news electronic arts has been voted the worst American company ever okay not ever but just in 2012 so I guess it's actually for 2011 considering the year just started whatever beyond that the consumerist holds an annual tournament to determine the most despised American companies nominations are put to a vote and the ultimate winner is crowned the worst company of this of the year electronic arts congratulations in a poll that took over 250,000 votes EA beat out the Bank of America for its greed and treatment of consumers with a comfortable 64% lead hell hath no fury like a pack of scorned gamers I don't think EA has ever double withdrawn someone's mortgage payment and I know people can be evaded have had that happen so I'm a little skeptical I know the study has been going on for a while but with the timing to the Mass Effect 3 ending wank this seems I timed poorly for the story for me I ate all the popcorn I'd saved for this story because I have not seen such internet lulls like I've seen this week on this story from all facets I mean there's obviously the people that you know voted for this and allowed it to win that just their seething hatred for EA that mostly comes down to everything that happened in Mass Effect and you granted there's the DLC stuff there's I mean I'm not letting an EA off easy here but you know it's not like they're Capcom there's I think EA's kind of taken the burden for everything that everything hey everybody hates with the gaming industry right now I think it's kind of said in that statement but then what also cracks me up is like the people on the consumerist that are like fucking gamers fucking gamers ruining this poll fucking Bank of America is the fucking evilest company in the world what the fuck is wrong with gamers obviously gamers are too poor to own a house and it's like you guys internet polls are really fucking serious business everybody look at your lives look at your choices you are all rabble-rabble ing over an internet poll on some website that is owned by the same people that don't go talk to I think I know no they sold it off years ago but then one time you know what I'm saying it's just who cares it's an internet poll it is not that serious you know what your worst company is and who you're gonna give money to and not and so forth it's it's kind of an individual decision so and meanwhile Activision Blizzard is going to dodge that bullet girl we ain't done shit the rest of this article is a pretty good read I'll leave it verbatim to those who might sneer at something as non-essential as a video game company winning the worst company in American vote it's that exact kind of attitude that allows people to ignore the complaints as companies like EA to nickel-and-dime consumers to death argues the site for years while movies and music became more affordable and publishers piled on bonus content or multiple modes of delivery or multiple modes of delivery is added value to entice customers to buy video games have continued to be priced like premium goods for its exploitation of the downloadable content model the consumerist will be sending EA a little golden poo as a trophy the poo is usually presented on a red pillow but this year the company is sending a choice of colors mocking the controversial Mass Effect 3 ending haha like the Razzies sorry it's okay as gratuitous as EA's deals he is I can't help feeling that it's not quite as bad as illegal foreclosures of or some of the other scummy things the companies in the running did there you go though the internet hath spoken also hath was my addition it said has but there you go and I loved EA put out some response that was very like we don't give a fuck like it was very much like all this money on our naked bodies we don't care it's so amazing no it was very like well I guess Halliburton and Exxon and all of them are really happy that they didn't win the award this year and then pop cap put out a statement that was like you fucking design quality games for 30 years I'm paraphrasing clearly you fuck his healthy pop cap would put it that way but it was basically you fucking design games for 30 years that are quality games and try to make the internet happy and see where it gets you but in my opinion that statement as much as I love pop cap I love them a lot but that statement they need to step away from the Borg hive mind that they're starting to become a part of because that's not the reason why EA won this award look at the reason that look at the trends that EA has been starting look at the things that people don't like EA invented the online pass EA you know obviously this whole Mass Effect thing they're taking some of the brunt on that EA sports games every year with no discernible difference is probably the exclusive contract is probably the driving force between behind trying to lock out used gamers in the next gaming cycle you know they want that to happen look at origin Oh God an origin yeah not wanting to play nice with other gaming companies they they refuse basically to play by the normal rules of Xbox Live and we're like either we get to build our own infrastructure or we're not putting our games out on your system and the kind of using that muscle Mass Effect 3 isn't on Steam and you know that would sell there exactly so anyway enjoy your golden poo yeah internet polls are very serious business clearly now there's an interesting follow-up to the all this stuff it isn't directly a follow-up to the same same story but there's always going to be that guy that asks what about all the good things EA did and to be fair EA had a couple big stories this week that were some good news so let's cover them one of them which I think all of you have got to be aware of by now but it is out there they have announced that there will be Mass Effect 3 extended cut Mass Effect 3 DLC extended cut is coming out it's going to be coming out this summer it is going to be providing a more fleshed out experience for their fans it's going to bring closure to the ending is there nice PC way of saying we're gonna fix the goddamn ending then fine here's the big thing about it that I got a mid even caught me is my surprise it's gonna be free it's gonna be free through April of 2014 or something like that and even then they said they buy aware said they only end dated it because EA has a policy on free DLC has to be end dated and they won't ever charge for it if they can get away with it and it's free because it is not an addition of playable content or missions it is literally you restore a save before the final encounter before all of the expositor expository narrative ending cinematic crap and that visually that you watch is expanded upon so it's free because it's not it's it's additional content but it's not playable some rumors going around that the voice actors for femshep and male Shep have not been asked to come back yet which implies that you know and again I got a I got a tread lightly around the ending here but if they're not in it then how could they really do much of an ending that perhaps it's just gonna be text on the screen all a text I think that's a little bit silly there could be some type of like third-person narration or something going on I could see that happening but or maybe it's gonna be told from somebody else's point of view like years later or something I don't know I think there's still a lot they could do with it that even though they don't have the voice actors back but it sounds like again the Internet's already not happy with it well it's it's not a new ending which is what people are demanding they're like throw this shit that you put in the game out give us something completely different but they wear that there I was like no this is our artistic you know point of view so it's not a different ending and it's not any new ending choices they are just fleshing out what's already there yeah trying to explain it more or what have you so in a way it's kind of like saying well it's very metaphorical and up to your imagination and you didn't get it so if you didn't get it then here's we're gonna throw you a bone so what do you think about the fact that the internet got their way well they didn't they didn't I mean they're getting something else I'm actually I'm legit surprised they're doing it for free and I said a few weeks ago on the show I said if they don't put it out for free then they're just assholes and to my surprise they're doing it for free so I have to stand by what I said and that is that it's hard to complain about this I feel that they only really did this because their analysts or whatever saw evidence of an actual fist fiscal impact with the fact that Amazon was accepting Mass Effect 3 returns as a defective product I know that's really cynical and pessimistic it's nice that they're throwing the Phantom of fandom a bone but you know if EA has the final say this is just damage control to say that they they attempted something even if fandom still hates it and I think that their hands were forced because they could possibly lose money off of the degree of butthurt that the Phantom was showing so as far as the fact that them them getting getting their way but they kind of didn't get their way they didn't they didn't I mean it's gonna be really hard to say until it comes out but I just I think there's gonna be a lot of people that still aren't happy with it imagine if the internet it was what it is today with Final Fantasy 7 right oh no game will ever be as hyped up or as anticipated as Final Fantasy 7 was but we kind of just had to eat shit and deal with it was kind of a jank ending we didn't really have the outlet or resources to freak out on a company like this but what happened to you fee who feet visit what do you mean what happened they weren't even there exactly all right I think a lot of people probably already made up their mind on this DLC though did you have anything to say Jason I'm just effect so I I will probably get around to the series eventually but yeah not yet completely missed it well here's something that impacts Mass Effect and it's and some other Bioware games it's something Bioware is kind of known for and Bioware obviously tells these very deep stories and sometimes romance is an option in these stories and Bioware has been in many ways a pioneer for any type of relationship you want meaning if you want to be in a straight relationship or if you want to be in a gay relationship and they're starting to get some pushback for that and EA is EA who owns Bioware is kind of the target of all this there is an anti gay letter writing campaign going on right now EA's received several thousand letters objecting to same-sex relationships in their games the letters are being sent to a variety of senior leaders at EA threatening to boycott EA games until it changes its policy EA is standing by it say standing by their games saying they will continue to include LGBT characters in their games as options every one of EA's games includes ESRB content descriptors so it's hard to believe anyone is surprised by the content this isn't about protecting children it's about political harassment that's from EA's chief spokesperson Jeff Brown obviously Mass Effect 3 allows you to do man woman man man woman woman woman alien shit you can do whatever you want in Mass Effect and Mass Effect 1 was originally going to have same gendered pairings but with Dragon Age Origins coming out on the horizon which had a more involved relationship system they cut that content out and let Dragon Age Origins set that precedent mm-hmm and Mass Effect 1 sorry to interrupt took a lot of heat from conservative funding groups for having sex at all and many people having a sexual machine which isn't like it's not that much more than you'd see on an episode of like nip tuck or something I mean for real anyhow Star Wars the Old Republic is going to be having same-sex relationships it's been reported and some people are not happy with that because they don't they only see it as Star Wars like oh that movie I loved in 1978 it's gonna get the homos we can't have that later ain't no homo of course it almost had incest slightly so although that is completely right although that is completely incest is a okay but heaven forbid Vader be a homo which isn't even how it works Star Wars the Old Republic takes place thousands of years before the movies and all that it's completely different and saying it should be noted same-sex relationships aren't in the game yet it's been noted for a future patch it will be in the game the letters are coming from Florida the where the Florida Family Association is at and again EA is standing by it but I mean they're doing these it's clearly a form letter and if you look at the form letters like people will hand write messages on them that say like remembers like look at this one there's a handwritten message here you'll get a kick out of this thank you remember Sodom and then it's signed I had a friend who turned into salt last week so that shit is real and you will not minimize that that still happens can I read can I read the hate mail here dear mr. Riccitello it was troubling to learn that Bioware and Electronic Arts were pressured into committing to add LGBT content to Star Wars video games pressured by who they always announced it was going to be there I am also concerned that Bioware employees state in postings at SWTOR.com that they have been censoring deleting and banning forum members for expressing opposing views about including homosexual content in the games children play guess what on a person's private forum the First Amendment does not exist for example if you're a guest in my home and you start talking like you know imagine if we invite somebody over let's say Jason's our guest and we invite Jason over in our house and Jason says you know I really hate faggots and I don't know how you and Alan can be faggots together what's gonna happen we're gonna throw him out right we're gonna we're gonna ban him right we're gonna kick him out of our house and he's not allowed to come here anymore obviously he wouldn't do that but I'm just he's sitting right there and he's an example this is the same analogy here if you come into somebody's house and say something they don't like they have every right to remove you you don't get a First Amendment yeah the overwhelming number of players on Star Wars games is children who do not need to be forced as a captured audience to participate in homosexual content thirty-year-old children living in their parents basement whoa whoa whoa again if you're letting your child play an MMO unsupervised they're not getting that $14.99 a month themselves someone's credit card uh-huh we ask that you please adhere to your long-term policy of omitting and steering clear of this type of advocacy representation in your games what EA had a policy no please do not include LGBT content in Star Wars video games that will impact so many children thank you remember Sodom there it I mean the facts are just being distorted terribly I mean that this is here's the thing about this though is that you know these people don't fucking play video games because video games all together are the goddamn devil yep so there's no there's no real boycott happening here this is all for show it's all for press it's all for show it's just like those idiots that get out there at the funerals that say God hates fags and you're burning in hell because America embraces fat mr. Rogers is burning in hell because you know America's a fag-loving country and all this I hate that I'm using that word so much tonight but unfortunately I see it in these you know protests and things like that and it's just they do it what for attention for those that remember I know this isn't all that similar but when nipplegate happened with Janet Jackson at the Super Bowl the FCC came out and said that for all the thousands of complaints that they got it was some random group that was made up of 20 icky old creepy old white dudes that just had a form letter and they spammed the shit out of the FCC so the the fact that they're getting as many complaints isn't really representative of how the public feels because these these are just really isolated groups telling that they're following to send this form letter dozens of times and that adds up that makes it's just people making a fuss because they have nothing better to do with their lives they this is what they choose to do instead of going out into their community and choosing to do some good because what Alan and I have is so threatening there is no gay agenda because we're either at the bar or the gym we don't have time stop you Amy stop it anyway so it's even I love that they scan this in its signed I can't read that name is that homa Johnson home no homa Jay Lorne homa Jay Lorne dear homa Jay Lorne shut the fuck up anyhow prop CEA at least for standing by this whole thing because you know what I gotta say this even though I haven't played Mass Effect 3 myself yet I spoiled myself and looked at some of the stuff on YouTube I've looked at all the different romance scenes I've looked at the female female I've looked at the male female I've looked at the male-male relationships and I got to tell you the male-male relationship that they do one of the one in particular they do in the game is so well done it's it's kind of refreshing to see that it's a relationship that's not about the bar or the gym or any of that stuff it's it's really touching and they do it so well and so tastefully like I just can't believe people are so offended by it they want to take it out of the game stupid if this is what earned EA a big golden poo hold it up high right let's move on I'm all huffy now after that story well let's do the mailbag let's follow that up with some listener emails you know what the people I like to hear from let's do some listener emails every week you guys send us emails you mailbag at orange lounge radio.com and dark soccer opens up the email bag and read some of her favorites but she's not here tonight we took a poo in the bag and detrimental to ourselves isn't it here all right no there are there are some good emails tonight and Alan's gonna read them tonight will writes us and asks can't remember if this has been brought up on olr yet or not but have any of you checked out the web series titled cron tendo it's one dude playing every single Famicom slash nest game release in chronological order oh my god he plays them enough to give a basic review and some history of the title needless to say it's a massive undertaking and worth checking out he has a YouTube channel but much more content is posted on the archive org site he also started a cron Sega series which is going through all of the master system titles in order the humor is pretty dry but fun to watch anyone wanting to know more retro gaming history or looking for some old games to play will want to give it a look man some people have a lot of time I think it's great it's a great endeavor though I saw similar linked me to it might have been dark Sakura actually a group of let's play people on YouTube there's four of them they did a simultaneous battle toads the original that game is hard as hell it's it's on YouTube but it's quad screen just a competition to see who could get reach the end of the game the fastest and it's filled with swears because that game is hard now is very fun so look up about battle toads competition for that second email is from Stan who writes hi olr I have a question for you and anyone listening or this could be a future fool question what video game franchise would you like to see reimagined or translated into another genre for example the morrows the Mario for example the Mario series was fantastic as an RPG yes my answer would be seen the Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy characters be introduced in a Soul Calibur game so like Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy well there was our guys you want to kind of stretch it a little bit I also think it'd be funny to see Grand Theft Auto reimagined as a Japanese dating sim game now that's just silly signed Stan sent from his iPhone and he's very upset about the Instagram news this week no um gosh that's that's a tough one what would I like to see cross genres and persona 4 is getting a fighting game and I saw that email from Alice and I was like what how about an 8-bit version of demon souls like the platforming game where it dials up on a modem it's just basic online no it's just asshole Mario is all you guys have heard of the the the portal mod for the original Mario one haven't you oh yeah the Mario with the stylized oh yeah have you heard what the latest update is gonna be I think I heard something about soundtrack six player co-op now that sounds fun yeah not exactly cross genre unless you want to say it's portal being ported to 8-bit sidescroller that that yeah that question is really insanely difficult yeah my mind is just stuck in the fact that Super Mario RPG was freaking gorgeous and that was like the first RPG that ever really meant something to me and I actually I think it might be my very first RPG I ever actually beat Superstar Saga was not half-bad partners in time I didn't get far enough into but was still pretty fun I mean a Disney RPG Kingdom Hearts was grand I don't I don't know that there's one specific series that would mean something to me in a different genre though that I could really pick yeah this is a hard one especially because I didn't really think about it beforehand like I'm trying to look through my game collection right now and see if anything jumps out of my eye is like something I'd want different Alan did anything come to mind for you at all I'm still thinking about it I have some great comments from chat oh let's hear some of those chat that orange laundry new calm god of war in the style of Mario Party Kratos is mad cuz he got max stars but someone else got a star cuz they didn't get any stars how about okay I got one I got one I got one Saints Row as a Pokemon game but it's hose gotta catch them all I catch them all and it's so many different ways or it's diseases cuz Saints Row is a fucking hilarious game and I would like to I'd like to see it as kind of like a silly RPG call me call me crazy any other comments from chat or was that it I'm looking people are talking about Mario franchises Call of Duty Oh a first for our head shot against Princess Peach how about Mass Effect as a more fantasy RPG like with hit points and shit instead of the whole like first person although I gotta say I do I don't know shows Shepard arrives on this hit L and pulls out a gun blade not that crazy but I don't know that I gotta admit I'm not much of a first-person shooter type person but the map the combat Mass Effect is pretty darn good I guess I really wouldn't change it I did hear though they were doing that legit first-person shooter out of Mass Effect and that would've been kind of fun to play I think yeah us to move the music game as an RPG kind of dance summit style yeah cuz you got kitty Ann and then you know she could cast spells disco spells disco spells that would be the name of the game disco spells well all right ah all right there you go that's it for the emails tonight send us emails mailbag at orange lounge radio.com again that's mailbag at orange lounge radio.com my answer to that question also is Ridge Racer but as a puzzle bobble slash puzzle you're dropping cars down they just trying to fill blocks like poll poll here weird all right let's do the F use of the week it's the part of the show where we get angsty I'll start tonight fu to that people that are sending those letters to EA there's so many reasons to hate EA but that's not one of them that's one of the reasons to appreciate what they're doing so F you to all of them F you to sheep F you to people that are sheep because that's who those type of people are are sheep so think for yourselves F you to sheep Alan I guess F you to the fact that I had a job interview two weeks ago and I didn't get it you know shit happens it's good to have an interview but also while I was trekking home from that interview for the job I didn't get I was completely done up in a suit dress shoes you know interview attire rolled my ankle on uneven pavement and completely ate shit on the sidewalk hilarious I'm sure should be on YouTube if anyone had a camera going out so yeah F you to I guess not getting a job and being a klutz in the middle public F you did not having a job and needing a new pair of pants now yeah nobody to buy it throw the pants out because the road roush was so bad it ripped all in it do you have anything Jason F you to myself for forgetting how to get out of a door of a car I have this really nasty gash on the right side of my head because I apparently when I grabbed my bag in turn to get out of the backseat of a car I leaned forward and just completely knocked the corner of the door it hurt a whole hell of a lot and it looks pretty nasty and it feels kind of nasty but anti F you to immune systems and the ability to recover from that and I think there was another thing something about keys and doors and where I'm staying while I'm out here but I think I think the injury made me forget it so I guess I don't have it right now if anyone asks story though if anyone asks someone tried to mug you and you beat the shit out of them and that's the little mark or tell him it's a sex injury let him try to figure it out I think I was coming up with some kind of I I tried to participate I was a casted for the role of something and face-off and that was the suspicion mark they tested to see how how good my face bar fight bar fight yeah bar fight go with that cuz that coat you'd like a beer bottle could have hit you right there oh yeah easily I bar fight right position mm-hmm all right there it is your F use the week all right a few more news stories for you guys and then we're gonna open up the skype line actually we're gonna hear from some people from PAX East first I'm gonna bump their call in first night so we can talk to them about PAX East because we all ignorant because we weren't there so we need the ol army to help us out especially the New Yorkers and and surrounding areas who did go so we'll talk to them in a little bit but for now a few more stories for you guys Jason miss explosion man is finally making it to iOS more specifically explosion man of any form is finally making it to iOS which will arrive this summer you may remember a couple months ago Capcom decided to make a very similar game by the name of Max explosion that came out on iOS and there was a little a little a little kerfuffle between the two studios Capcom and twisted pixel twisted pixel says well you know Capcom made Megaman so I guess it's not all that bad and drama ceased very quickly miss explosion man was obviously the hit sequel to the original explosion man both Xbox Live arcade titles miss explosion man is heading to the App Store with a version for steam on the PC games for Windows Live another PC gaming service and Windows Phone 7 as well no specific pricing or specific release date just sometime this summer if you were at PAX East maybe you played it and if the game differs in any way call in let us know I am legit excited about this game that I'm about to talk about and it's kind of sad when you get more excited about the portable version of a game then the console version of a game but you I have legit reason for this guy's epic Mickey of course is getting epic Mickey 2 on the consoles which you know is all fine and dandy whatever still we right we Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 okay so good for them stepping it up but on the 3ds Disney epic Mickey power of illusion oh yes it's what it sounds like it's a basic I don't want to say a sequel to but heavily inspired by castle of illusion oh my god that game was gorgeous for its day and a really amazing platformer oh my god and now it's gonna be on the 3ds and it's going to incorporate yet you get to draw objects that magically transform into Disney style 2d illustrations and then they're gonna be 3d on the 3ds is top screen blah blah blah but it gets its influence from a lot of modern-day Disney movies like Tangled is gonna have a level and yeah I'm so excited about this Beauty and the Beast from the screenshots here you can see I mean it's just got that right mix of like retro look to it no Tron no sale you never know you never know Peter Pan Tron is in that Kingdom Hearts game coming out dreamed up distance so it just looks gorgeous I'm so excited like I could care less now about the console one just bring me that 3ds game you guys is a 3ds game I'm excited about yeah it's not just a port a 3d port of a client of a good classic game like Zelda Rama in the chat room put it best I can't say it any better myself shut up and take my money amen Allen so this story is a doozy wow I'm not sure how to report this I guess I wanted you to do this for a reason I guess the state of Arizona just looked at Florida is the worst state of in the country and was like no we have to do better and and for the last seven or eight years they have been okay so this story is about a bill that has passed the both sides of the state legislature so it's ready to be signed by the governor and it's the anti trolling cyberbullying bill is it just me or does the governor of Arizona kind of reminds you a Cruella de Vil like I'm not sure he's the one who put her finger in the face of Obama yeah yeah just like don't doesn't she remind you of Cruella de Vil a little bit like I'm not trying to get political or whatever and I'm not it's it's just she's kind of nasty anyway sorry didn't mean to derail you yeah so it passed both houses it's waiting for the governor to sign it a governor Brewer and basically if let me read exactly what the the statute dictates it is unlawful for any person with intent to terrify intimidate threaten harass annoy or offend to use any electronic or digital device digital device and use any obscene lewd or profane language or suggest any lewd or lascivious act or threaten to inflict personal harm to the person or property of any person so you cannot be shitty to people on the internet if the recipient is in Arizona because if they try to prosecute you it could be a class one I think misdemeanor which I want to say the maximum fine for that is $2,500 and up to six months in jail is that the right direction that the receiver has to be in Arizona I kind of figured it would have been the cinder the origin oh that that is actually addressed here let me find it sorry yeah come arrest me Arizona sucks what are you gonna do about it there are already exceptions to the First Amendment which is freedom of speech which is which is obscene and obscenity is very vague and also inciting violence site like saying this person should get beat up let's all meet at the place in time that's inciting violence but just being an asshole on the internet you know think of the penny arcade greater internet theory have you ever read the comments to a story on yahoo news oh my god they would fill the jails in Arizona overnight I'm fucking serious go read the comments to any story on yahoo news story any of them or the answers on yahoo answers it could be a story about like fluffy kitties and dogs and it'll be like that dog is fucking ugly and it looks like an Obama dog because Obama's ugly and all like this this is what oh my god I gotta go to yahoo news right now and give you an idea what I mean here a whole new level of quality for the show huh this is important because yes and this is this is how it ties into the gaming world because of course what did gamers love to do more than anything troll be shitty to each other with no consequences which I guess this bill is trying to fix and if this bill does get signed it's like many bills that California itself has had where it's effective as law for like a minute and then it immediately gets shoved into the courts and it's unenforceable and it gets juggled around in the courts to decide if it's constitutional not for years and eventually goes away so already you know people are saying that this is way too vague and there's no way this is enforceable and blah blah blah and call me a grammar Nazi unless that's illegal in this state but the text of the the text of this bill is it's one of those things like for some reason there have been these weird weird quirk grammar stories in the news lately notably talking about the the talking about a the new iPad because they only referred to it during the keynote as the new iPad so if anybody says I want the iPad 3 no you want a the new iPad but you you read you read the text of the particular statute and what jumped out to me immediately was it is unlawful for any for any person with intent intimidate blah blah blah to use a any electronic or digital device it is unlawful for any person to use a any electric or digital device is one little letter I don't I don't mean to like narrow in on this but it's just kind of like the language already sucks but to throw something in there that just doesn't make any damn sense come on guys so if I write something rude on the side of a toaster incentive trolling here's I just fucking arrest you in Arizona because you're trolling you are now a wanted criminal in Arizona since the bill stipulates that the offense only has to occur on Arizona soil that basically puts the entire internet on notice according to this article so if the infraction allegedly is it is viewable within Arizona which of course Facebook last I check doesn't filter themselves out of Arizona maybe they should now that'll make the people in Arizona really happy Google already block YouTube in Arizona yet yeah that'll probably be in next week's stories we out so if the infraction is you can view it from an Arizona network then you I guess according to this bill have the right to try and prosecute the narrow mindedness of something that in their dream little world could affect to the whole freaking world another addition to this is that if the trolling is contributing proof if you're able to prove that it's attributing to actual stalking of a person then that would bring it up to a class 3 felony and there's a whole additional cache of stalking laws that would then be brought into this I guess it's supposed to be a countermeasure to cyberbullying which I do believe kids have killed kids have killed themselves because of hate pages made like this page that someone is you know a fat slut on Facebook that's shitty and parents and teachers should get involved so cyberbullying sucks but an anti trolling bill is not the way to go about it at least not the way it's written so some sections of Yahoo News have apparently switched to requiring Facebook logins which I guess a lot but here let me give you an example here's a story on President Obama wishes Jews Christians happy Passover Easter so what's the harm in the president wishing people a happy holiday for whatever it is they believe it right nothing wrong with that right let's see Jack Haynes says Obama stop lying we know you're a secret Muslim Bob Harvey says Muslim use a fabric Bob Harvey says I'd vote for Reagan's corpse before I vote for this egotistical clueless inept narcissist there actually is a story about a dead politician beating an alive one Jack Van Valen says did he get the okay from the Muslim Brotherhood like and the thing if you if you are Republican Democrat whatever I don't I don't care you Romney Obama just don't fucking vote for Rick Santorum seriously oh my god like that I draw the fucking line at that asshole but I mean he is the president scroll up what's the headline again Obama wishes President Obama wishes Jews Christians happy Passover Easter the White House Christmas card from this most recent December was I think their cat or their dog I don't remember what fucking pet they have it just said happy holidays that's it no Merry Christmas or Hanukkah or anything happy holidays with no Christmas tree and no nativity and the Christians flipped their shit now he's wishing Christians and Jews a Passover some Christian sorry flip their shit yes so it's yeah can't win for losing any how it's okay if you're Muslim all right now that Christian or at you can't we all just get along holidays of advertising past all right now only if you're in Arizona all right look less politics more gaming stories Jason help with well I guess it's not exactly politics but cute childish I owe cute iOS app childhoods end back online after pedo bear mix-up Apple was worried it might be a recruiting tool for pedophiles essentially what this boils down to is that there was a tower defense game called childhoods end which featured large bears converging on the point where you would die in a tower defense scenario and the developer submitted an update and the one particular Apple the one particular App Store reviewer got a hold of it and said why is pedal bear advancing on a childhood game and they they sent the developer a notice that they will need to take extended time they will be they will need additional time for an extended review and immediately followed that up with direct contact with the developer and expressing their concern and caution over the subject matter I've never heard of this app before and I looked at a I looked at a lot of stuff about it but perhaps one of the things that doesn't exactly help why were you so interested in a pedo bear app I'm just researching the story the description of the app says use your wits and tactics to guide big Phil along his quest in this engrossing defense game with towers join big Phil now and help him navigate his adolescence as he fights off the evil teddy bears of his childhood your tactical skills and with a little bit of luck is all big Phil needs to see him through his teenage years not exactly the childish that you would expect but you know you know what's in a name there's a couple things coming out about the this article I haven't exactly understood what exactly this is but they put a there's a screenshot of the in-game bears versus a picture of pedo bear and saying of course the image is broken now so I can't recite it off but it's it's it's drawing a contrast that this is a teddy bear you will see it in almost any American child's home that has stuffed animals why is this a big deal I mean we know why it's a big deal but this particular version just makes no sense the the game was subtly changed the art for the bear was changed a little bit at the update resubmitted and I believe it's been approved at this point now Peter bear free yeah if one of those things said it's a silly situation for something that probably didn't need to happen but it did so man you know one more news story for you guys before we get to the calls and as if this show couldn't go any further down the toilet I think this news story is kind of like it's trolling that somehow is traveling across the game blogosphere because this guy can't be fucking serious I'll go governor Brewer well the arrest this man it is who did this it was Camille german pres I'm sorry if I butchered that name but Camille german pres talked about studio are kato's they made the game hell yeah for Sega it's one of their first games to come out they're taking a month off and then they're gonna come back and do some more games but saying it's a guess packs East booth the comment was quote we're gonna make two games one game on P and one game on poo yes that's right one game on P one game about P and one game about poo it's going to be a steam game I think okay and yeah it's on I swear to God it's on every game blog go go look at any of them and this to peepee poo-poo presented with no comment is that what I just heard do I need to comment on this story about what is there possibly I mean can we set the bar we already had news stories about the the urinal games where they were installing games on the urinals for men to play or you know women if they want an extra challenge while they relieve themselves women get the metal gear solid version where no one catches them in the bathroom cuz that might be kind of awkward for my birthday will you get me the pea and poo plush dolls that are in chat if that's what you really want is this for real yeah they were on sale in the cast are actually a couple years ago you would know that I just I have an idea what a poo plush doll looks like but I want it oh god they're so cute maybe they got license to this game or something I don't know you need a license okay nevermind maybe pee and poo have been licensed they're the actual characters Rama can you post salacious pops linked to the tumbler so the podcast listeners have an idea or talking about cuz I I can't how much do they want for this Oh sorry particular all this item is discontinued no pee and poo for you I'll make you a poo for your birthday oh if you go on eBay you'll find that pee and poo plushies are a collector's item how much do they go for and on that note we're gonna go to the Skype line we're gonna open it up right now and take your calls at one eight seven seven game OLR or our username on Skype is orange lounge radio actually I do want to make sure our PAX East people get through so I'm gonna kind of wait and let them call in first here cuz I want to hear from people who went to PAX East against one eight seven seven game OLR our username on Skype is orange lounge radio and here they come

yeah this is my third PAX East this is your third PAX East where does this rank because I was reading some negative negativities on Twitter the negativities are probably coming from the people that were complaining about the fact it was the same weekend as anime Boston hey look people if you gone to more than five to six anime conventions in a year it wouldn't kill you to go to a gaming convention which was a hell of a lot better just just please shower while you're at the convention that's all we ask I actually at the game you can at this one there was a lot of showering there was very little confunk laughing because act-deaf in the chat room the pee and poo dolls might be out of stock but now there's an HIV plushie so oh geez and the habit there it's in a family with a hepatitis C and a tuberculosis and polio I love the internet I love it so much oh yeah PAX East so what was on the show floor what were they showing we didn't hear a lot of news news come out of PAX East no no it was just from like there's a lot of independent developers especially from the Boston area I mean there was a big all this big Microsoft display really then really pushing the Kinect games over in the corner was Nintendo over the same place they were last year pimping out the 3ds with one new game spirit camera it was a nice mention of MMOs you had League of Legends all the way towards the back of the expo hall but packed all the damn time there were people wandering around checking out lotro and D&D online and one other thing that packs does a lot of too is that they just have like it's not just about the new games or whatever this on the show floor but there's like like people sitting in the hallways playing card games and people playing D&D in rooms and people playing Magic the Gathering and classic games and you I mean how many freaking games did you see people playing too many I mean there was like Catan I mean there was one booth I think I forget the name of it but you could pick up a game and play like borrow and just learn to play it I remember early yesterday afternoon I was coming back from expo hall I ran into a daisy cosplayer we were started talking next to you know I'm sitting there with her husband a couple or two other people were sitting there playing a round of Cards Against Humanity good times oh yes yes indeed um did you go to any of the panels because I know there's a lot of great panels and things that come out of them packs a lot of announcements come out of the panels I went to one panel the whole weekend it was the nerdcore hip-hop panel which is something I look forward to every year nice how was that it was great it was a little bit different from last year's where it was front a lot mega Rana came Murdoch they pretty much discussed the history of hip-hop nerdcore how it came together last year mega had discussed more about how he got into it his backstory this year it was a little bit more about front a lot it was pretty cool um who did the concert this year was there any concert yeah there was a lot of concerts Friday night was more was um Metroid metal and the proto men I forgot who was on I think was storm runner I think that was the first one I caught a part of Metroid metal and this was my first time listening to them and I was like wow the best way I can describe Metroid metal is this take Metallica India prime at plus one I love Metroid metal we've played some of their stuff on the show it's good stuff I picked up both their albums will be listen to it on the way back very nice Saturday night was a Colton Paul and storm front a lot and mega ran okay wait look what I found look what I found Metroid metal I can't wait for Metroid scream oh oh Rob here's a quick story that you'll greatly appreciate hmm as we were as me and Jovian walking into the eye this is a convention center I had said to her that I saw somebody with a x-plate a pin on their back I'm like I threw mine in the garbage he's like why I'm like because I don't support you for the person at least six feet in front of me over her he's like yeah I can't stand them either next you know it is about 20 to 30 people going into convention to complain about how much g4 sucks well done Boston well done yes yes indeed all right so before I let you go what else do we need to know about PAX East anything else you got to share with us I did check out a couple of games um Final Fantasy theater rhythm it's a fun game Oh only Square Enix can take a music rhythm game and make it into an RPG 40 bucks worth is it worth it yeah I said that's definitely a day one purchase hmm interesting okay all right I also checked out Sonic the Hedgehog for episode 2 and is it as shitty as the first one I love the graphics the controlling not so much I'd wait but I but this was something funny because we were talking to one of the people at the booth sorry I had a cry for Sonic talk to one the guys at the booth and you say it's only going to be on 360 and ps3 because this is a wheeze hardware limitations they won't be able to port it and I said to my sister uh but yet I have Sonic 4 episode 1 on my Android phone and

right and I hope you're not too mad I changed the classic game of the week no bitch all right I kind of expected it cuz honestly I you know I would have been disappointed if I didn't get to do the one I wanted exactly so we'll hear that in two weeks when we come back with OLR anything else you want to let the listeners know before we let you go pass out from Robitussin I'm not gonna pass out from Robitussin not for another hour anyway all right then before I hang up on you um no bye bye bye bye dar Sakura thanks for calling it's always good to hear you know check in say hello the phone's ringing off the hook tonight hi you're on orange on radio who's this so Shane hi Shane what's up I'm playing World of Warcraft that's what's up did you go to PAX East this weekend I totally didn't so why are you calling I don't know why are you calling you you called us what do you want what's on what's on your mind um I wanted to respond to the EA getting the worst company of the year thing or whatever uh-huh I totally after reading EA statement that they put out I felt really bad for them and I kind of feel like the internet won and lost because they were just way too loud and they should not have you know beaten Bank of America of all people you do realize in their statement they need like they said well at least it wasn't Halliburton or did it and yeah they named like three of the prior winners of the contest I didn't know their prior winners but still I don't I don't think they should have even come close to winning I think there were a lot of other companies up there that I saw and they're like half a picture I would see on Kotaku when I'd sadly go to their site like I think I saw a Best Buy up there which they deserve to be up there I think I saw I think I saw AT&T which deserved to be up there here's the thing though here's the thing does it really matter it's just the internet it's a poll on the internet no honestly I guess it's publicity and you know the whole saying about publicity and stuff and it's never bad blah blah blah well right after we reported on that we turned around and talked about a couple good things that EA is doing and I'm sure you have opinions on these so first yes the Mass Effect 3 ending um I'm torn I appreciate what they're doing it's still not what I would like but one of the writers clarified some things this week on Twitter and it sounds like a lot of the doom and gloom that people inferred from the endings were because the writers thought we were smarter than that but you know that's a stupid thing to think when you're basing it off of things you've seen in the game for the past however many years the series has been going so I'm excited to see the extended cut I know it's not going to satisfy me though because it's not what I exactly want which you know that's an impossible request anyway I kind of I mean can they do anything to make you happy though um yes what they could do is make a Mass Effect 4 with all my same characters and just make a new story and keep it going cuz I am not done with Shepard or any of my crew members even the ones that may or may not have died in 3 and so you're trying to sleep with and continuing your relationship with yes especially Caden and you want a more explicit Mass Effect 4 no no but better romance scenes would be nice because it's it's like you know maybe a ten-year-old came up with them and they didn't have any concept of what a relationship is besides like kissing and holding hands and maybe like hitting the other person every so often well wait a minute though okay let's get into the other story which is about the whole target of the EA is a target of the anti-gay campaign so you've you've obviously romanced Kaidan with your with your man Shep so your benefits yeah you're benefiting from the content that they've put in the game a do you think this campaign means anything no it's just something for that stupid organization to do this week cuz they pick something new every week and B well you kind of like showed me these scenes that you know the the man-on-man with Kaidan and all that and how well done they were well they're well done well okay wait wait let me back up the romance scene is not well done once you get into the romance part but like the date scene and the conversations they have brilliant because I aware for the most part can write amazingly well but they need to learn a thing or two about romance scenes cuz Dragon Age that was laughable I didn't see Mass Effect 1 I didn't do anything in two because you know saving myself for Kaidan and in three it's like let me get pushed down on the bed and then we're gonna roll around for like half a second and oh we're under covers now and we're sleeping okay but it's not like they're gonna get porno on you you know but it was also more like can't spoil things it was like a shirtless scene of something that you do earlier in the game with another crew member that isn't romantic at all wrestling well there's like a like a little sparring match that's kind of what it reminded me of except we had no pants all right pants in the sparring match all right but but otherwise I mean it's certainly more interesting than what we've probably seen in any other video game wouldn't you say probably more interesting you know the male male or female female stuff we've seen in other games which has been remarkably little but I'm sure in other games there have been better male female romance scenes because I assume that the developers are probably straight and have more experience with that like they couldn't just load up like a porn website okay that is pretty blanket statement to make though I mean there's probably hundreds of people that work at Bioware I'm sure there's a couple people there that have some you know first-hand experience well I'm saying the ones that that designed the scene not that worked there period gotcha sure they're like three all right uh Shane I gotta let you go to get some more calls you have anything else you want to say mmm oh you should go download the rest of your download content for Mass Effect 2 because the shadow brokers what I did today that $10 one and it was amazing it was so so good right now except I spent all my points on that pinball arcade game well go buy more points one more problem solved holy crap I gotta let you go bye now bye bye all right one eight seven seven game olr excuse me or username on skype is orange lounge radio acidic vampire in our chat room says the actual romance scene is kind of dorky in Mass Effect 3 but the after romance scene is quite touching bonds double o six says enchanted arms for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 that has tons of guy on guy action I vaguely remember that but I don't remember having tons I just remember being one of the first but anyway we have more calls coming in so let's get to them hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hello you're on orange launch radio we can't hear you hello oh no I heard it it's click hello wait did you hear me yes we do now hi yes damn mic switch gotta love those zenocore from the OKC how you guys doing hey how you doing zenocore see I knew you knew how to work your Skype it's had to be something like that all right what's on your mind buddy and not much of it I purchased Arkham City finally because I said screw it I'm not gonna get any DLC anyway and it's ruined gaming for me now I can't play half the other games because it's not as satisfying but I'm sitting knocked everything out of Barbara I can't play Skyrim now because the combat sucks I can't play dragon aids I can't play half the RPGs I got anymore because the combat just does nothing whatsoever Arkham City is just that fucking good like it raised the bar that high that now everything else sucks asylum is better than that I mean the only thing that holds a candle to it as far as a RPG like environment I'm not counting Mass Effect because it's a first-person shooter is mountain blade of all the things that's the guts they got the most visceral hand-to-hand combat that I know of in an RPG like setting and that's a conquest game so technically doesn't even count and it's very disappointing to me is it just the combat that you love about Arkham City or what is it about this game that makes it so great it well I guess just the way it goes you actually feel like you're really whooping ass I mean everybody knows this about Arkham City in Arkham Asylum anyway this isn't new news but the fact that nobody else has done this in any other game yet is freaking annoying to me I mean I finally upgraded my POS computer to something that's near top of the line I play Arkham City and I can't play half the other action action or RPG games on it because they all suck as far as that it's all I'm doing is clicking the mouse at least in Batman you're somewhat managing things and using multiple weapons all at once I mean you hell when they did added that stuff with Catwoman's like holy shit this is fun as hell just beating people to death little whip but it is it is really it's just it's funny to hear you say how much it's just ruined everything else because it's so good I know it man I never thought I'd be in this position so I just blew almost a thousand bucks on this machine and I've gone back to playing like Space Harrier 2 on the on the Sega emulator I got off of Steve and everything else just because nothing after I start after about 10-15 minutes I got to put it down because it's not as good as Arkham City or I look oh my god so what about the rumors of Arkham world I'm not paying attention to those we'll see but that combat engine is unique it's not gonna work in anything that's that large because it's tied to together like the combat from like a way back when from the game Oh knee when that first came out of ps2 that combat system was amazing but the way they built it you couldn't do anything else with it there is no multiplayer ready thing because the way they glued it together so I think Arkham City and Arkham asylum that style of gameplay is gonna be stuck in that have you checked out any of the DLC yet I'm not going to Robin Nightwing whatever all I need is a big bad cat woman and I'm good that's interesting I don't know why but I find that very interesting that even though you love the game so much you're like man don't really need to do the DLC cuz like for me like I I probably will have to play all that Mass Effect DLC at some point just because I'm getting so into this you know Mass Effect DLC Jesus man what a what a racket that was have you played the Mass Effect DLC and no because my roomy he bought the game run it released and he was gonna ruin it for me so after seeing what actually were rewards you get it's like beating Rygar but not doing it in an old-school way the old-school Rygar ending was something you got because you fucking earned it everybody can get to the ending in this game and it's gonna be a piece of shit so why bother oh my god pay for it that's a classic 8-bit game I really need to try and do start to finish like your event yeah my car was two screens and one of them has some animation on that's it but that game was so freaking hard you're glad to see that screen because you do not not many people get to see it but seriously yes but uh and then they're just gonna slap a patch top of Mass Effect 3 to explain the explaining the ending apparently so they're not gonna actually make it to where you actually steer the character in one of three directions without making a single choice at the end which ruins the whole experience for me so now they're not getting any my money for that series anyway all right any last thoughts before we let you go tonight Xenocore yeah the dark Sakura let that tussin soak in there girl remember put some water in it shake it up more tussin tough it out all right now hopefully she's listening I hope she heard that all right take care buddy later all right bye 1877 game olr username on Skype is orange lounge radio I guess we can try and squeeze in one more call we're getting a lot of calls tonight so I'm gonna really try and fit in one more call here before we say goodnight meanwhile I need to read tweets I have I have been totally ignoring the Twitter's at twitter.com slash olr but let me read some tweets for you right now no I'll take a call then we'll do tweets be the last call tonight hi who's this yeah hey Zaku what's up yeah me and uh Adam your Ron was you after the column we all went to packs together hell we even room together nice how was it how'd you enjoy PAX East it was uh was it was almost a almost the same as um last year in terms of crowds like like Friday was just like the heaviest day like just trying to try my luck in in watching these trailers or playing some of these games there were like at least two two hours plus in line it wasn't even worth it what I did do was just hit up most of the panel though stuff like the harmonics panel on Saturday when they actually explained the whole process is to how rock band blitz became actually got it gone about like it actually started off as a prototype and you know within this was a prototype that was done within the course of a at least three years even though it didn't pick up full steam until that last summer so it basically went through several iterations where you know it for example the they actually they did a lot in terms of trying to figure out the proper controls seeing that they they propose so many so many ideas and solutions that most of them ended up failing until they found the one that worked which is basically either the joystick using the the D pads and the buttons or the shoulders just to just to hit both notes and then the whole notion of having whether or not to make it just like like frequency and amplitude in terms of a shifting you from one instrument to another automatically so it deviates from that in the sense that you can just play any you could stick with one completely like I tried it today and I was I was pretty much bouncing from one one track to the other within the song so you know coupled with the fact that you could just do mostly power-ups that you gain as you as you obviously hit more notes then it just basically it's almost like audio surf but in the sense that everything's structured more importantly everything is um it just said it's just binary in the sense wait did they have to have audio surf too on the floor no no no that wasn't there I'm pretty certain prime will probably that depends if they the developers of get get themselves a booth for prime but back to the point it's like like back in the days of amplitude it was pretty much the same way but it's the fact that the songs themselves of rock are like a rock nature where it's not like techno and this is one of the questions that was brought up in the panel I guess they're there the rationale was in the it's easier to just you know release a product in which on day one people who have existing rock band users and consumers could just you know start playing right away with their with their current with their current collection whereas if they added things that normally wouldn't fit into a into that rock band caliber like a techno trance on that was made you know that and made frequency and amplitude pretty much a you know called classic then it would just like folks have to start over from scratch let me let me try to get away from the rock band stuff for a minute we've seen so much about it on the internet what other panels did you get to all right the other all right other ones I like let me see the Kotaku panel that was on Friday where everyone everyone in that panel was taking it over for an hour so I just threw out one little question in terms of a sort of like an inside thing in Kotaku if you were like really in the in the site you would actually know like all their sections like how they how they have their own blocks of stories they let anyone have a panel they clearly are letting anyone have a panel so I want to know our panel at PAX Prime yeah but that was that folks writing stories within the hour and actually you know they actually they had a little work actually air their grievances in terms of banning people or or or actually taking pictures and so forth it was even live blogging that's productive open the floor back up to the people dance on a website yeah I mean did they suck their own dick in front of all you guys too no it's like they were just alright they what happened was like the the editors or actually the former editor of Kotaku was was spearheading the panel so the idea was that folks who just like pitch their their story ideas and the audience the the audience would actually pick the ones that that they would want to they would want to hear about and within that hour they would have to actually produce it you know write an article for it did they have a big on the site and did somebody judge people yeah the editors obviously the editing team was pretty much making sure everything was there all right no no disrespect but I could give two shits about the Kotaku panels tell me about our other one all right the other one was caught the tail end of the epic panel where cliffy be basically we're just going off on sir you know for questions in the audience one of which was a you know a girl actually trolled the whole panel is in saying that you know she wants to see Gears of War on PlayStation 3 and to which cliffy replied he will if they fix the you know they fix that god that weak rumble the ps3 controller and then she was promptly arrested in the state of Arizona for trolling the panel all right but the last one I caught was a was basically a classic arcade panel like you have no interest in penny art you know packs they have they have an actual classic arcade room like nothing but old arcade machines good I love that were the folks from the from a cam the American classic arcade museum actually they ran the panel with with a couple of developers who actually worked on the original like the original older arcade titles one of which was a food fight and miss pac-man and then the other the third one was he was a developer for a crew for the cruising series as they were going through how back in the day they were like they basically started off from their dorm dorm rooms at MIT to the point where they they made they made mod kits for their for existing arcade arcade cabs like one like one for missile command that actually extended the gameplay but in the sense that you know you would get more revenue because the the challenges would be harder you wouldn't be playing the same thing and with your guy with a with a single quarter and sheer sheer skill could just like stay there for hours on end so you know it gets to the point where they get to buy Atari and then they get picked up and then they start creating this pac-man and to the point where it leads up to the the crash we're running long here Zaku let me let me just quickly ask you your favorite thing about the whole con certain prizes swag it's just like a free shit I mean I think I played battlefield 3 and a cop you know in a mini tournament and all I got was a 4 gig USB drive but it was just like not only that is the after party the the curse party the curse is like a service site that hosts like all these forms like including ones for Minecraft they had a killer party with like open bar and everything and the whole works and that was yesterday and they're saying me and Adam had had ourselves a kick-ass time all right Zaku I gotta let you go but I'm glad you had a great time actually I'm a little jealous but I guess I'm happy all right take care Zaku all right have a good one later some things haven't changed all this coming out of people's MIT dorm rooms I I love hearing the stories about the old game design though my god those guys really loved what they did and it's just folks that were younger than you or I am now you have designed these classic classic games all right I have to close up Skype you guys we were running long now and I'm really sorry to those didn't get through it was lit up tonight I still haven't even touched Twitter I've got to quickly say we're running like so long so let me just read a few tweets here Rhetortainment tweeted us saying Bank of America tried to foreclose on homes in a state that they don't have the right to operate in how did EA win worst company because it's the internet lol lol lol lol dark to see you says the hunt at olr is heating up your next challenge starts this week it might be a little different from what you're expecting go play the hunt go get your score in joust he said he'll extend it to like Tuesday or Wednesday I know what I'm doing on the bus tonight there you go you can you can you can work it on your iPhone you exactly it's not restricted it's kind of like an on your honor thing like if you go and Photoshop something you're just a dick and don't don't play in our competition just to be a dick but if you're gonna play on different platforms I think that's cool like I saw act def screenshot and because he's from Mexico all the Xbox stuff was in Spanish and I thought that was cool because I don't usually get to see that it's different let me read one of Tiger Claus tweets here he always sends us some great tweets I need to cut it a little short tonight but I will read this one because this is about a company that we talked about a lot about here on the show Activision Blizzard has been sued for patent infringement of virtual worlds usage due to World of Warcraft and Call of Duty they're being sued by worlds Inc worlds Inc claims that World of Warcraft and Call of Duty are violating the patent quote technologies created by worlds have helped the business of virtual worlds and gaming and the sale of virtual goods to grow into a multi-billion dollar industry that was from worlds Inc CEO Tom Kidron while we are pleased to see the gaming industry and is rapidly growing customer base of enthusiastically embraced our patented technologies we deserve fair compensation for their use this is the second time they've done this they filed suit against NC soft in 2008 for city of heroes it was dismissed after a undisclosed settlement was obtained worlds Inc has been in business since either 99 or 2000 you know what I don't know of them but to say they invented I've heard the name too but to say they they're responsible for World of Warcraft and Call of Duty it's kind of like dude I think copyright law online especially needs to be updated because it's things have changed since the Revolutionary War just slightly ah all right we got we gonna wrap it up we're running long tonight who knew that it would be a long episode when we have guest hosts tonight but I'm so thankful to you guys for stepping in tonight I really appreciate it Jason thanks for being here do you have any final thoughts for listeners tonight I guess I will say that actually as a result

occasions for me to be able to get back on this show again for more than what is this the fourth episode I've been on I believe I think so you come by anytime you're welcome the door is always open
