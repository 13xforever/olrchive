00:00.000 --> 00:04.480
You're listening to the podcast Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 454.

00:04.480 --> 00:07.840
Before we get to tonight's show, we would like to start with an important announcement

00:07.840 --> 00:12.000
that occurred during the taping of the Bobby Black Wolf Show the night of the recording.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.800
Up first is that clip courtesy of the Bobby Black Wolf Show.

00:20.640 --> 00:28.000
But right now, it is 6 p.m. on the West Coast, 9 p.m. on the East Coast, and I want to say hello

00:28.000 --> 00:32.560
to all the OLR listeners that are coming in for OLR. I'm Bobby Black Wolf. I'm typically the opening act

00:33.280 --> 00:40.000
here on Sunday nights. We typically don't talk meta that much about where we broadcast all that

00:40.000 --> 00:45.600
often. We feel that those type of conversations are best kept off the airwaves and in private,

00:45.600 --> 00:51.200
but indulge us for a few moments as we discuss some things here. All Games Radio has been our

00:51.200 --> 00:56.880
home for a long time. I was actually the first broadcast on the network here almost seven years

00:56.880 --> 01:02.560
ago. And OLR was actually our first affiliate to have a pre-recorded show, and then eventually I

01:02.560 --> 01:08.800
was able to get them to move over to be broadcasting here on All Games. We've had a lot of great

01:08.800 --> 01:14.800
experiences here with this network, from E3 Outpost to the Xbox Live GamerPix to PAX08 and

01:14.800 --> 01:20.560
E4ALL on the live broadcast. Lots of great things have happened that I know I personally will

01:20.560 --> 01:25.680
cherish for the rest of my life. And even though I was removed to station manager and site admin

01:25.680 --> 01:29.840
several years ago, I've enjoyed the community and the stage that has been here. It's been my home

01:29.840 --> 01:36.480
for one hour a week here on Sunday nights. There are changes coming to All Games Radio, and

01:37.280 --> 01:43.360
they're changes I don't personally endorse. They're not necessarily bad, but they're not

01:43.360 --> 01:48.720
ones I personally want to be a part of. And one of the other show hosts here on the network stated

01:48.720 --> 01:54.400
that if all you wanted to do was just have a stage to do your own show and not attempt to help move

01:54.400 --> 02:00.640
forward to make the network a better place, then you needed to get out of the way. So even though

02:00.640 --> 02:08.560
I don't personally endorse the proposed changes, I don't wish to stand in the way of them. So tonight

02:08.560 --> 02:14.160
right now I'm announcing that this right here is my final broadcast on All Games Radio.

02:17.120 --> 02:21.760
Well, this might be a good time to mention that there is a reason we haven't hung up just yet.

02:21.760 --> 02:28.000
You know, Orange Lawn Radio started as its own fully fleshed radio station in 2002 on Live 365,

02:28.000 --> 02:32.560
and after five years we made a business decision in light of escalating costs to move to the All

02:32.560 --> 02:37.360
Games Network. This arrangement, you know, as Bobby mentioned, it was really initiated and

02:37.360 --> 02:43.360
championed for by Bobby. We've been absolutely honored to have Bobby. As he puts it in his words

02:43.360 --> 02:48.720
as an opening act for the past five years, we view it a little differently, but without Bobby's

02:48.720 --> 02:54.480
efforts it's very possible that OLR as we know it would have ended several years ago. You know,

02:54.480 --> 02:58.960
change to All Games Radio is going to be a great thing for the station, but it's time to let you

02:58.960 --> 03:03.760
all know that a plan was drafted some time ago that will require us in order to take Orange

03:03.760 --> 03:09.920
Lawn Radio to the next level to leave the network as well. Tonight's upcoming episode, episode number

03:09.920 --> 03:17.120
454, will be the last Orange Lawn Radio on the All Games Network. We've been fierce supporters

03:17.120 --> 03:23.520
of independent podcasting and podcasters, and this is not and will not change. We remain supporters

03:23.520 --> 03:28.640
and fans of the All Games Network, even though the future for Orange Lawn Radio will involve our show

03:28.640 --> 03:34.720
being elsewhere. Out of respect to the other hosts and community at All Games Radio, we will not be

03:34.720 --> 03:39.840
unveiling those plans here on their bandwidth. Stay tuned, you know where to find us. Yes,

03:39.840 --> 03:48.000
the show will go on next week, and yes, Bobby is still the co-headliner. On my way out, there are

03:48.000 --> 03:54.960
a couple people I do want to thank, first off being Orange Lawn Radio. They were my inspiration

03:54.960 --> 03:58.880
to start podcasting. They were, I don't know if they were exactly the first podcast I downloaded,

03:58.880 --> 04:02.960
but they were the first one I listened to religiously. Back in the to-go days, it's been

04:02.960 --> 04:08.320
a great joy to be able to help them be a part of this community. I remember being so scared emailing

04:08.320 --> 04:14.880
them the first time, and then now I get to talk to them every single week, pretty much. I got to go

04:14.880 --> 04:19.760
to Disneyland with them and hang out with them. It's been an honor to work with them, and I look

04:19.760 --> 04:26.080
forward to what we're going to be working towards here in the future. The community here at All

04:26.080 --> 04:31.280
Games. We've had some good days, and we've had some bad days. People that are probably in the

04:31.280 --> 04:35.360
community more often than just Sunday nights know what I'm talking about, but ultimately I will

04:35.360 --> 04:40.960
remember a lot of the good stuff. The hardest part of this is that I will probably be leaving

04:40.960 --> 04:46.640
the chat room where I've idled for almost a decade sometime this week, and it's going to be kind of

04:46.640 --> 04:55.040
hard to say goodbye to that, but sometimes it's time to move on. Tiger Claw. You guys probably

04:55.040 --> 05:01.520
don't realize this. If it was not for Tiger Claw, this stage that we have been on probably would

05:01.520 --> 05:06.800
have collapsed a year ago. He is the man that has been keeping the light on for the rest of us,

05:07.520 --> 05:11.440
because he's been kind of acting as station manager, and he has championed bringing in

05:12.880 --> 05:18.080
other people, other podcasts to the community, and I'm sure that he's going to help keep the

05:18.080 --> 05:22.640
light on for much, much longer. Thank you very much to Tiger Claw for everything.

05:22.640 --> 05:30.240
Lastly, Scott Rubin. While Scott and I did not see eye-to-eye on everything,

05:31.360 --> 05:36.240
and I might have actually felt that there were some unfair characterizations made of me back on

05:36.240 --> 05:42.160
the All Games Interactive days, off the air he has been very supportive of me and wanted me to

05:42.160 --> 05:49.600
succeed in everything that I wanted to accomplish. I am here to do this tonight because of him,

05:49.600 --> 05:55.200
because of his advice, because of his support. Without Scott Rubin, there would be no Bobby

05:55.200 --> 06:00.000
Blackwolf, literally as in he actually picked out that name. I didn't come up with that name,

06:00.000 --> 06:05.600
Scott did. Just as Scott has moved on from All Games, he's doing high-profile live streams for

06:05.600 --> 06:12.640
made-stream TV networks. It is time for me to move on from All Games, but I thank Scott for every

06:12.640 --> 06:17.680
single opportunity that he has given me. All right, so we want to thank some people,

06:17.680 --> 06:23.360
too, but our lists are probably very similar. First, Bobby Blackwolf, obviously, for all the

06:23.360 --> 06:28.560
obvious things we've already stated. The other hosts at All Games Radio that work their asses

06:28.560 --> 06:33.200
off to produce quality content for this network and promote the independent gaming community.

06:33.200 --> 06:41.040
I personally have loved meeting all of you at the various events, the PAXes, the E3s, the Outpost,

06:41.040 --> 06:47.040
so on. Unfortunately, not every show is really in the All Games network to promote the community,

06:47.040 --> 06:50.880
but I'm not going to dwell on that. There's a lot that are very passionate about it.

06:50.880 --> 06:55.040
You've been noticed, you've been appreciated, and I hope we can work with you in the future.

06:56.080 --> 06:59.760
Although we don't want to name everyone specifically for fear of leaving someone out,

06:59.760 --> 07:04.400
if there's one host we need to tip our hat to besides Bobby, it's our own personal pod

07:04.400 --> 07:08.160
father and the man that taught us a lot about internet radio, Travis Donovan.

07:09.360 --> 07:13.360
Specifically to the OL Army, if you're hearing this, you've stuck by us through every tough

07:13.360 --> 07:18.240
decision we've made. You've supported us when we said we are no longer exclusively a Bimani show.

07:18.240 --> 07:23.840
You supported our creative decision to end the live afterbirth segment of our show,

07:23.840 --> 07:27.760
because it just wasn't striking our creative spark anymore. You supported us when we left

07:27.760 --> 07:32.160
Live 365 to take our show to the next level, and we know you will support us as we leave

07:32.160 --> 07:36.240
All Games Radio to take it to stage three. And I think this is a good time to reiterate,

07:36.960 --> 07:42.720
we will be back next week, and you will be able to listen to us just as easy as you do now.

07:42.720 --> 07:48.160
But out of respect towards the network, we're keeping that under our hat as to exactly how

07:48.160 --> 07:54.560
that's going to happen for a few more days. Tigerclaw gets our thanks as well. All Games

07:54.560 --> 07:58.560
would not be able to function right now without Tigerclaw. He's passionate about this network,

07:58.560 --> 08:04.640
and every host on this network owes you a lot of thanks. Of course, Scott Rubin, although certainly

08:04.640 --> 08:09.040
we've mentioned Bobby a bit in how we ended up at All Games, Scott was a crucial piece of this

08:09.040 --> 08:14.480
as well. Although we give the mainstream gaming press a lot of shit on the show, Scott is someone

08:14.480 --> 08:19.200
who lived it, left it, and built an online network that fit in his independent vision,

08:19.200 --> 08:25.040
and we all have so much respect for that. So I know I've been monopolizing the conversation.

08:25.040 --> 08:28.800
This is like the first time in probably five years I've read from a script, but I want to allow

08:28.800 --> 08:32.800
Dark Soccer and Loki, because their OLR is just as much as me, to say anything they want to say

08:32.800 --> 08:37.520
about this as well. I'd like to thank myself for being awesome. No, really, you said everything

08:37.520 --> 08:43.200
that I could say, and Jesus has nothing to do with this. Thank you for letting us know. Loki,

08:43.200 --> 08:50.720
anything? And I will still not be updating the radio app on PSP. OLR PSP.com will still stay

08:50.720 --> 08:57.440
out of date. Some things shouldn't change. Some things have to stay the same. Bobby, it's all you.

08:58.720 --> 09:02.320
Well, I think that this is the part where I'll be letting you guys go. I had to write my stuff

09:02.320 --> 09:09.360
to a script too, so any last words here before I send everybody off? Don't cry. That goes for you,

09:09.360 --> 09:13.920
and it goes for the listeners. It ain't over. We still have a show left. Stay tuned. We're still

09:13.920 --> 09:24.080
having a show tonight. I know this is shocking, but this is how you have to start the future,

09:25.120 --> 09:29.600
and good luck to everybody, and I really, really wish All Games the best of luck, and thank you so

09:29.600 --> 09:35.440
much for having us for the past five years. Good luck. All right, Orange Lounge Radio is up next.

09:35.440 --> 09:40.400
Thanks so much, guys. Thank you.

09:40.400 --> 09:46.640
Orange Lounge Radio.

09:58.240 --> 10:05.760
Tonight, April 22nd, 2012, Halo 4 has a release date. Nintendo announces new games for the 3DS,

10:05.760 --> 10:10.320
and the upcoming enhanced Baldur's Gate won't be coming out for one particular system.

10:11.760 --> 10:14.080
Orange Lounge Radio.

10:16.000 --> 10:21.360
Heard any good jokes lately? Hi, everybody, and welcome back to another week of the show where

10:21.360 --> 10:26.160
every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio. My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky.

10:26.160 --> 10:29.360
Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers.

10:29.360 --> 10:29.920
So full.

10:31.120 --> 10:32.320
Full of poop.

10:32.320 --> 10:38.080
No, I'm going back to my raw food, so I went out with a bang.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.920
It's always some fad diet with you. It's not a fad.

10:41.920 --> 10:43.760
Not fad diet, but it is always some diet.

10:43.760 --> 10:46.080
I was really well, I was really happy as a vegan.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.160
I think you're purdy just the way you are.

10:48.160 --> 10:50.640
Well, I'm not doing this for purdy. I'm doing it for healthy.

10:50.640 --> 10:53.920
All right, fine. Also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

10:53.920 --> 10:54.320
Hi.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.560
Who's still on his pizza diet, clearly.

10:56.560 --> 10:57.360
It's not a diet.

10:58.800 --> 11:01.120
Well, because that implies that I'm eating pizza all the time.

11:01.120 --> 11:03.520
Well, Loki, don't worry. I think you're purdy just the way you are.

11:04.240 --> 11:04.800
Really not.

11:06.400 --> 11:12.880
All right. So anyhow, we're here. We're live. Live, as you'll hear on the podcast,

11:12.880 --> 11:17.600
as our live listeners heard for the last time at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com,

11:17.600 --> 11:20.880
right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern.

11:20.880 --> 11:25.520
Join our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to chat live with us on this

11:25.520 --> 11:29.760
lovely evening. What is the date today? I don't even know. April 22nd, 2012.

11:29.760 --> 11:31.440
That's right. Cause my birthday was last week.

11:31.440 --> 11:35.840
That's right. Happy darn birthday. Before we get into our gaming weeks, let's talk about,

11:35.840 --> 11:38.880
we were gone last week. We didn't have a show. I know this was a whopper of a

11:38.880 --> 11:42.560
night to come back to, but Hey, it's just how it went down. Um, Dark Sakura,

11:43.360 --> 11:45.120
how was your birthday? What'd you end up doing?

11:45.120 --> 11:50.640
Well, not really a whole bunch of stuff. I went to get delicious Indian food with you and Alan

11:50.640 --> 11:57.200
and Pinkberry. And Dan took me to claim jumper where we split and I declare for dinner.

11:57.200 --> 12:04.560
I felt so sick that night. He got me a really neat art book from 1944 that I've had my eye on.

12:04.560 --> 12:06.640
It was neat. It's very cool.

12:06.640 --> 12:08.160
Very old museum-y.

12:08.160 --> 12:13.920
Well, on top of that, it was a lot of, because keep in mind this particular edition was fresh

12:14.560 --> 12:20.320
right after World War II. And it had some of the really cool art movements that had occurred just

12:20.320 --> 12:26.080
like 10 years before that. So for me as, as a designer, it was a real treat. And then, um,

12:26.080 --> 12:31.040
you and Alan got me a sailor suit for my Duffy. So you can look at your Duffy bear and say,

12:31.040 --> 12:37.520
Hey, Taylor. Yeah. Well, I love Duffy. You all know that. And you two are the only people who

12:37.520 --> 12:44.160
got me presents. Oh, it's okay. I have everything else that I pretty much want. So it's all good.

12:44.160 --> 12:49.040
Plus once you, once you get to a certain age, it's kind of hard to buy presents anymore.

12:49.040 --> 12:52.160
No. When you get to a certain age, your presence costs 600 bucks.

12:52.160 --> 12:54.880
You know what? I want money. I want money to pay the bills.

12:54.880 --> 12:58.160
That would be a great, you know, it was like, it was like, when I was a kid, you'd get money,

12:58.160 --> 13:01.680
go, what do I do with this? I have to have someone take me to places. And then that

13:01.680 --> 13:05.280
means that my mom will know what I'm buying. Right. And then you get older. It's like money.

13:05.280 --> 13:11.040
Give me more money. I can pay my bills. And video games cost $60, $60.

13:11.040 --> 13:14.640
You know, that's how much I played for killer played, paid for killer instinct on this nest.

13:14.640 --> 13:17.760
Yeah. I was gonna say, I guess, I guess to be fair, video games have always been kind of

13:17.760 --> 13:21.920
expensive. I mean, street fighter two is a cartridge was what, 80 bucks?

13:21.920 --> 13:25.200
We're not one of those are no mortal combat two or one of those, the ones,

13:25.200 --> 13:28.880
you know what the most I've ever paid for a video game is? Um, actually I probably do.

13:28.880 --> 13:34.320
Was it your Castlevania symphony of the night on, um, I've paid more. Okay. Well,

13:34.320 --> 13:37.360
actually the Saturn one was like 20 bucks. Your game with the dish.

13:37.360 --> 13:44.000
It would probably be a game. It was 280 bucks for king of fighters, 2000,

13:44.000 --> 13:47.200
but Dan and I thought it was going to be the last one to come out. Little did we know the

13:47.200 --> 13:50.880
summary showed on five would be the last one to come out, but Hey, we wanted to buy a brand

13:50.880 --> 13:56.240
new Neo Geo game just to say we had, and we were in a different place then. But, um, but no, um,

13:56.960 --> 14:03.520
I pretty much, you know, if there were like the only thing that I actually had on my want list,

14:03.520 --> 14:06.880
you know, if you could call it that is an iPad and I'm waiting on that one. Cause I'm going

14:06.880 --> 14:14.560
to Disneyland next month. Hello. So, you know, I can wait on that. I have my netbook. It works,

14:14.560 --> 14:21.120
you know, it's, it's sort of like, like I'd said, you know, back during Hanukkah Christmas, Kwanzaa,

14:21.760 --> 14:27.840
whatever holiday was politically correct statement here. I know. Um, I can't remember how

14:27.840 --> 14:37.360
so is like, I've got tons of stuff. I don't really need anything and I've got tons of stuff to do.

14:37.360 --> 14:41.600
You know, it's like, it's not like I can't just go and play mass effect that Rob loaned me.

14:41.600 --> 14:47.360
I have no problem just going and playing mass effect that I bought myself. But anyway,

14:47.920 --> 14:56.160
but you know, I've, I've got, I have great friends and I have a wonderful hubby who it sometimes can

14:56.160 --> 15:00.800
be a jerk face, but for the most part is really cool. Uh, you're gonna make me sick. It's too much

15:00.800 --> 15:05.120
emotion on this fucking network tonight. All right. But for the most part, like I said,

15:05.120 --> 15:12.320
I've got everything I pretty much need, so I'm cool. I'm not, I'm not all gimme gimme anymore.

15:12.320 --> 15:14.880
Let's go way to look at it. Although I do like the ABBA song.

15:16.720 --> 15:22.480
Um, I was off last week cause I went to Disneyland for Jamie's birthday. Um, I went to the final

15:22.480 --> 15:25.920
electronica. That was the whole reason because I am such a nerd. I had to go to the final

15:25.920 --> 15:29.840
electronica. I've talked about it a million times on the show. I don't want to re explain it,

15:29.840 --> 15:34.240
but you know, it was, it was really great to be there for the last show and everybody booing when

15:34.240 --> 15:38.800
they pulled the plug. I'm a little disappointed that they just literally shut the lights off

15:38.800 --> 15:44.320
on everybody. You know, grids down lol. Bye. Get out. Um, I got to see the Tron pinball machine,

15:44.320 --> 15:48.320
but Flynn's arcade was so crowded because people knew it was the last night it would be operating.

15:48.320 --> 15:52.960
You know, Dan's friend has one. Oh really? Has the deluxe edition too. I need his address.

15:52.960 --> 15:57.360
Yeah. I'm going to go play. Uh, supposedly they're keeping the Tron pinball machine at Disneyland.

15:57.360 --> 16:02.560
It'll be like the one Tron thing still left in the parks. Um, but it was, it was kind of a crowded

16:02.560 --> 16:07.360
day. Um, so we didn't get to do a whole, whole lot, but electronica, but that's what we went for.

16:07.360 --> 16:11.680
And I was happy. Um, I did the driving, so I didn't get to play a lot of games in the car.

16:11.680 --> 16:16.800
Sadly, Loki, you, you guys have actually been out because you, you guys weren't on the last show

16:16.800 --> 16:20.720
before the vacation, right? Cause that was the Jason and Alan show, right? Yeah. Cause it was

16:20.720 --> 16:25.280
Easter. Yeah. How was your Easter? What have you been up to Loki personally? Not much. Just

16:25.280 --> 16:33.280
hanging around the house and took Josh over to my mom's house and did the egg hunt and stuff.

16:33.280 --> 16:37.200
He didn't really care about that stuff though. He's probably not old enough yet. He's just like,

16:37.200 --> 16:42.720
Oh, Hey, there's some of my treats are in this egg. I'm done. I just want to eat this one. He's

16:42.720 --> 16:46.960
the one they have the attention span of a, you know, Labrador puppy. Is he old enough to

16:46.960 --> 16:52.080
appreciate the greatness of peeps? No, he can't have peeps cause they're choking hazard. Oh,

16:52.080 --> 16:56.000
darn marshmallows. Oh man. I'd be a terrible parent. I don't even think about that stuff.

16:58.240 --> 17:05.120
That's why I have my wife. She, she thinks of that stuff. Um, no, I I've been doing other,

17:05.120 --> 17:12.000
other things like playing games, lots of games. Well, lots of a game. Well then let's talk about

17:12.000 --> 17:14.880
our gaming weeks. Cause we usually like to start off the show talking about what type of video

17:14.880 --> 17:19.280
games we have been playing this week. Um, so dark soccer, what video games have been in your world

17:19.280 --> 17:25.280
this week? Well, um, not so much actually playing, but we've been doing play through watching lately.

17:25.280 --> 17:29.520
Dan and I have. That's fair. So we watched the play through of summary showdown because

17:29.520 --> 17:34.880
my friend Gary had never, he, he didn't even know about the game and we're like,

17:34.880 --> 17:39.360
what planet are you on and how are we letting you in our house? We're fixing this right now.

17:39.360 --> 17:44.800
Exactly. And like we were even explaining like, uh, you know, some of the bad translation in it,

17:44.800 --> 17:49.920
some of the English, which was funny, like, uh, how about we were calling, um, a box, a,

17:49.920 --> 17:56.240
a happy funster and, uh, you know, just showing how you like, you know, even talking about,

17:56.240 --> 18:00.240
cause a lot of the characters in the game are based on historical and cultural fictional

18:00.240 --> 18:05.040
characters. So we were like trying to explain, you know, it was pretty cool. And then, um,

18:05.920 --> 18:10.000
today we're actually watching a play through of Kanoa. So that's why I said my next cat's name

18:10.000 --> 18:15.520
is going to be Kanoa and I'm going to get a rat named Hupao just cause it's fun to say Hupao.

18:16.400 --> 18:23.360
And, um, I actually, you know, it's, I've got a new job, so I've, and since I'm also in school

18:23.360 --> 18:28.240
full time and still have all of the graphic design projects that I took on while I wasn't working,

18:28.960 --> 18:34.080
I have been a busy bee. So I haven't really had that much time to sit and really play

18:34.080 --> 18:41.440
through anything. I haven't even had time to play much. Wow. Which, Oh my gosh, I've done like two

18:41.440 --> 18:46.320
dungeons all week. And then one of them was so failed that I quit halfway through. I hate that.

18:46.320 --> 18:50.800
And then it like just, just derails your spirit for the game for a whole week. I know it was like,

18:50.800 --> 18:55.040
Oh, screw these people. Why are horde players so stupid? One of my friends was telling me today

18:55.040 --> 18:59.840
about how final fantasy 13, two did that to him. Like he was running around for literally like

18:59.840 --> 19:04.560
three hours trying to figure out what to do and realized he was in the wrong time thing. They went

19:04.560 --> 19:09.200
to the wrong part of the story. And he was supposed to be in a chocobo that jumps and,

19:09.200 --> 19:13.920
you know, just, just dumb shit. Now you know how I feel in my Kingdom Hearts 2 game glitched

19:13.920 --> 19:18.800
when I skipped a planet and couldn't go back. I actually skipped all of Agrabah.

19:20.960 --> 19:24.960
Going to our chat room at chat.orangelaundry.com break man is in there saying sky doesn't have

19:24.960 --> 19:30.320
children or pets for their safety. Actually, I am the wicked stepfather to two kitties.

19:31.200 --> 19:36.880
My other half Alan, when we moved in together, he brought old kitties. They're, they're 12 years

19:36.880 --> 19:43.840
old this month, I believe. So they're, they're getting old. They're Medicare kitties, but they're

19:43.840 --> 19:49.440
still cute as hell. Yeah. And sometimes Sanrio will let me pet her. Yeah. Maruko is really an

19:49.440 --> 19:54.320
attention whore. Like all I have to do, like I go into bed, lie down, get my DS open. Like I'm

19:54.320 --> 20:01.040
going to play DSRB on my iPhone and like within minutes and he jumps up on the bed and he doesn't

20:01.040 --> 20:05.920
just like get on my feet like some cats do or get on my chest or whatever. He gets up in my face.

20:05.920 --> 20:10.480
Like I am here, bitch. Pet me right now. I told you what Shermie used to do when we had our bed

20:10.480 --> 20:15.600
on the floor. She used to crawl in under the sheets in the middle of it. Cause Dan and I use,

20:15.600 --> 20:20.000
we have separate blankets cause we're both sheet hogs. So we just use our own blankets and

20:20.000 --> 20:24.640
Shermie would crawl under and then put her head on my shoulder and just start purring away and

20:24.640 --> 20:30.240
sleep on my shoulder in the morning. That's cute. And usually just meant get up bitch and feed me.

20:31.680 --> 20:38.720
All right. Anything else for your gaming week? Um, no. All right. My gaming week. Um, actually

20:38.720 --> 20:42.800
not a whole lot because I've been focused on one game. What did you want to say,

20:42.800 --> 20:49.600
Jamie? You thought of something, didn't you? Damn stupid panda shit. Not installing. Fuck you,

20:49.600 --> 20:54.160
Blizzard. Fuck you. Oh yeah. You got in the wow beta and it won't work. Yeah. And I left my hard

20:54.160 --> 20:57.600
drive at home and I was going to copy your files. I would say something about, well, this is why

20:57.600 --> 21:01.360
they call it a beta, but I don't want to get actually, I have a four gig flash drive. You can

21:01.360 --> 21:05.040
use that guy. You can borrow that guy over there. I have a one terabyte hard drive just sitting

21:05.040 --> 21:10.320
there. I've got flash drive on me. All right. Anyhow. But my thought is because I've moved,

21:10.320 --> 21:17.760
um, my wow folder in full before I figured what I might be able to do is copy your installs and

21:17.760 --> 21:22.320
have them update on my computer. All right. Just don't copy the porn. All right. I downloaded

21:22.320 --> 21:27.760
the porn. It was funny. You really want to tell them why not? Cause it's hilarious. And keep in

21:27.760 --> 21:31.760
mind I didn't watch the whole thing just because it was so stupid, but it was a Mork and Mindy

21:31.760 --> 21:38.320
parody. I was so morbidly curious that I watched it. The question of the hour is,

21:38.320 --> 21:44.240
did it have the theme music? I just kept fast forwarding through the whole thing. The guy

21:44.240 --> 21:49.600
say nanu nanu. Yes he did. The very last thing, you know, after he does his splooge business is

21:49.600 --> 21:55.040
your nanu nanu and then it fades to the credits. I was like, my childhood has just been raped.

21:56.240 --> 22:01.840
This porn wasn't from the seventies. It was from like last year. It was done this year. Oh my God.

22:01.840 --> 22:06.720
And it's called Mork and Mindy, the dream zone parody. And it's like hideous and awful,

22:06.720 --> 22:12.000
but the girl does look a lot like Pam Dauber and the guy that played Mork actually does a very

22:12.000 --> 22:17.440
good cracked out Robin Williams impression. I realized there's change in all we've been

22:17.440 --> 22:21.280
talking about tonight, but last I checked, we weren't going to become a porn show.

22:21.280 --> 22:25.200
Oh, I just had to get that out. Cause it was, it was funny. All right. Let me talk about my

22:25.200 --> 22:29.120
gaming week. It's really been one game. It's still Mass Effect 2, but I did go through all

22:29.120 --> 22:35.360
the DLC this week. I said, because I realize I am right at the very end. And if I do the next

22:35.360 --> 22:40.640
mission, I set off a sequence of events where I won't get the best ending unless I play it

22:40.640 --> 22:44.160
to completion. People who have played the game will know what I'm talking about. And Alan Kluby,

22:44.160 --> 22:48.560
Alan's like a step ahead of me. And he said, whoa, whoa, whoa, don't do that mission until you are

22:48.560 --> 22:53.520
absolutely ready to finish the game. So I said, all right. So I did every side quest. I did

22:53.520 --> 22:57.840
Overlord. I did Arrival. I did Shadow Broker. I played all of it. Did your rival enjoy it?

22:58.400 --> 23:04.240
I'm kind of mad at myself for giving EA that much money, but damn, it was good. Especially of no,

23:04.240 --> 23:08.960
I think my favorite out of all the DLC was Arrival. And the reason why I think I preferred

23:08.960 --> 23:12.400
that one, I mean, Shadow Broker had a lot of cool stuff to it and there was a lot of great scenes.

23:12.400 --> 23:17.360
I realized that's kind of commonly people's favorites. The reason why I really loved Arrival

23:17.360 --> 23:21.600
was Arrival really felt like an episode of a fricking science fiction show, like Battlestar

23:21.600 --> 23:26.800
Galactica or something. Like I am playing an episode of a show, watching it play out.

23:26.800 --> 23:33.120
It has its very cliche twists partway through a good beginning, middle end. I mean, it plays out

23:33.120 --> 23:38.960
like an episode of a TV show. And I kind of wish as much as I'm kind of on DLC, like this is

23:38.960 --> 23:45.760
something I really like seeing in games is this like really true episodic content. So, um, you

23:45.760 --> 23:50.480
know, I can support DLC when it's, it's pretty awesome. Like that, that was my favorite by far

23:50.480 --> 23:54.880
was Arrival. Um, and Shadow Broker kind of felt the same way too. I realized it kind of plays in

23:54.880 --> 24:00.160
a lot more to the greater story. Um, and I think Arrival in some regards is supposed to tie it.

24:00.160 --> 24:04.480
It's kind of to bridge two and three together, which I get, but it still felt a lot like a

24:04.480 --> 24:09.520
standalone to me. I will have beaten that game by this time tomorrow. I'm, uh, pretty close. And

24:09.520 --> 24:15.840
then thanks to the, uh, sale on Mass Effect 3 this week, I have my copy of Mass Effect 3 sitting in

24:15.840 --> 24:21.120
the shrink wrap ready to go. So I can be really disappointed at the ending, just like everybody

24:21.120 --> 24:27.600
else, but the experience and the, what, probably 25 hours in Mass Effect 1 and at 35 so far in

24:27.600 --> 24:33.120
Mass Effect 2 plus whatever I spend there will at least be worth it. Loki, how about your gaming

24:33.120 --> 24:43.760
week? Um, well, I, I started playing some more stuff on my PS3. Um, basically, uh, infamous.

24:43.760 --> 24:49.440
I finally played a little bit of that and it's, it's okay. It looks old and seeing not even that

24:49.440 --> 24:54.880
old, but it just, I don't know. It's, it's all right. I may, I may finish it. Unfortunately,

24:54.880 --> 24:59.440
all my time is being taken up by Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3. He has finally jumped on that

24:59.440 --> 25:06.000
bandwagon. Um, after playing, you know, Modern Warfare 1 for a long time, uh, well, it seems

25:06.000 --> 25:12.000
like a long time, but a few months, uh, we decided to go ahead and make the shift to Modern Warfare

25:12.000 --> 25:17.760
3 and it's pretty awesome. I, I enjoy it and playing pretty much just all multiplayer because,

25:17.760 --> 25:22.800
uh, the campaign, I can never really sit down and play that for long enough, but, um, I'm enjoying

25:22.800 --> 25:27.840
it. I like the fact that first off the game still supports System Link, which is great because

25:29.440 --> 25:35.040
our internet kind of sucks at my work. Ironically enough, it fixed itself when we had a power outage.

25:35.040 --> 25:38.720
All it took was shutting something off and turning it back on. You know, the old, uh,

25:39.520 --> 25:46.960
IT standby and yet someone calling Comcast tech support. Well, did you try power cycling? I love

25:46.960 --> 25:51.040
how it's called power cycling. Did you power cycle? Like it's like fucking something out of

25:51.040 --> 25:56.000
Tron. Did you power cycle the cable modem? Oh, just hit that big switch that says power. Yeah.

25:56.000 --> 26:03.280
So now count to 10 slowly with me. One, two, three. Okay. Now turn it back. So instead of like,

26:03.280 --> 26:08.480
um, we have, instead of us having no connection to Xbox live, we still have a shitty connection

26:08.480 --> 26:11.840
to Xbox live, which I guess the shade connection is better than no connection, but we're playing

26:11.840 --> 26:16.240
System Links. It doesn't matter. Um, but I, I like the fact that not only do they have System Link,

26:16.240 --> 26:22.400
but they have the same type of leveling that you would do online, but offline. So you can

26:22.400 --> 26:28.720
actually level up your custom classes and stuff like that offline. So if you're like us that only

26:28.720 --> 26:33.200
play offline, it's kind of cool because you have your own stuff that you can level up. Now,

26:33.200 --> 26:39.120
granted that stuff doesn't transfer online, but you can still level up offline and you know,

26:39.120 --> 26:43.280
it's kind of fun. It gives us more of a reason to play the game. Um, so I like the fact that

26:43.280 --> 26:48.880
they added that cause they really didn't have to do that. Um, which is nice. I wish Grand Theft Auto

26:48.880 --> 26:54.160
5 did that because I just wish that that has System Link cause that'll be worth it. But actually

26:54.160 --> 26:59.040
I picked up the game on, um, on PS3 and on 360. So I have it on both platforms. I actually play

26:59.040 --> 27:04.960
with some of my coworkers on PS3. I'm actually, well I play online, um, on PS3. I haven't played

27:04.960 --> 27:11.840
online with my 360 yet, but, um, I may, you know. I guess that means I have to create an elite

27:11.840 --> 27:18.800
clan. So we'll do the OLR army. All right. Get the OLR army. Yeah. Awesome. All right. Well,

27:18.800 --> 27:23.520
I guess that wraps it up for our gaming weeks. So we will get into some news here shortly. Um,

27:23.520 --> 27:28.800
first off, we usually do housekeeping. Um, I think we said the pretty big part that we were, um,

27:28.800 --> 27:33.840
waiting to say. Uh, so we'll, uh, we'll talk about that later in the show if you want. We're

27:33.840 --> 27:37.520
going to do Ask Orange Lounge tonight in part B, um, cause we haven't done that in a long time.

27:37.520 --> 27:41.760
We didn't do a FUGL question this week. So, uh, Ask Orange Lounge will come up in part B. So we'll

27:41.760 --> 27:45.360
let you know when to submit questions, um, on anything, any topic that we figured it would be a

27:45.360 --> 27:52.080
good, a good segment, um, for our last show here at All Games. Um, also, uh, I do want to say,

27:52.080 --> 27:56.720
of course, as always, since we are on Facebook, we are on Google Plus at us facebook.com slash

27:56.720 --> 28:03.280
orange lounge, uh, and also Google Plus, just look for orange lounge radio, twitter.com slash OLR.

28:03.840 --> 28:07.120
All right. Let's get into some gaming news. Loki, you want to start us off with the news

28:07.120 --> 28:13.280
this week? All right. So it's Nintendo, Nintendo, Nintendo, lots of announcements for Nintendo. Um,

28:14.000 --> 28:18.240
first, let's start off with some stuff that they're talking about E3. Um, of course, E3 is

28:18.240 --> 28:22.880
just right around the corner, only a couple months away. And, um, you know, Nintendo's promised a few

28:22.880 --> 28:28.080
things that they're going to show. First off, they're showing a Wii U Mario game. Not a big

28:28.080 --> 28:34.880
surprise because they kind of showed off a Wii U Mario game last year with the E3. They had like

28:34.880 --> 28:40.640
a tech demo and that's actually what's going to be based on. It's based on that kind of new Super

28:40.640 --> 28:49.920
Mario Brothers with Miis. Um, and that's cool and all, but I mean, I don't know. Is that really a

28:49.920 --> 28:55.040
step up? Do I really need a Wii U for that? I mean, cause you're just giving me the game that

28:55.040 --> 29:02.560
you had last year or was it last year? I don't know. Recently on the Wii, but now you're adding,

29:02.560 --> 29:09.280
you know, Mii support. I mean, something that on a modern console, you know, ones that have updates

29:09.280 --> 29:16.080
to their games, um, you could just patch in, you know, and instead of releasing a whole new game

29:16.080 --> 29:19.280
for it, but I thought for some reason you could already do the Miis and the Wii game that was out.

29:19.280 --> 29:25.440
I don't know why I thought that, but, but I mean, okay, at least it'll be HD and native

29:25.440 --> 29:29.680
widescreen support or whatever. Um, there's gotta be another catch. There's gotta be something

29:29.680 --> 29:34.480
they're not saying there. I cannot believe, especially if this ends up being a launch

29:34.480 --> 29:39.040
title, which we don't really know. I'm assuming it's a launch window title. It's a lot of 3DS.

29:39.040 --> 29:44.320
I think it could be a launch title, especially if it's based off new Super Mario Brothers Wii.

29:44.320 --> 29:47.520
That's true. They've got to be rushing something. I think they're going to learn from the mistake

29:47.520 --> 29:52.560
of the 3DS and they're going to have a AAA something out. So it's probably, you're probably

29:52.560 --> 29:57.360
right. It's probably Mario, but I'm, I'm curious what the little gimmick is going to be, you know,

29:57.360 --> 30:03.760
cause how could Nintendo put out a launch title for the Wii U and not somehow integrate the whole

30:03.760 --> 30:10.080
screen in your lap concept? Like, I think it'll be something derpy. Like when you go in a pipe,

30:10.080 --> 30:14.560
you're on your screen and your other partners are still out there in the world. And then,

30:14.560 --> 30:18.800
you know, watch, it'll be something silly. Who, who like that?

30:20.640 --> 30:27.280
I mean, I have an idea what this is already, but we're not covering that until later. So

30:27.280 --> 30:31.040
I just think, I think it's a port of a game that's coming to another platform that they're

30:31.040 --> 30:36.400
going to do some things that it, that other game may integrate with the Wii U since it has two

30:36.400 --> 30:40.880
screens. All right. I can see where you're going with this. Anybody who's been paying attention

30:40.880 --> 30:46.000
to the news this week knows, otherwise we'll get to it in a minute. Yeah. So, um, I don't know.

30:46.000 --> 30:53.840
Um, besides, uh, Wii U, Mario, they're promising that they're going to reveal Pikmin. Um,

30:53.840 --> 30:58.960
and I'm assuming it's for the Wii U. It might not be, it could be for the 3DS, but that there's

30:58.960 --> 31:04.400
going to be a new Pikmin game. However, I think, remember, um, there's, you know, Miyamoto talking

31:04.400 --> 31:11.120
about Pikmin game a while ago, but just nothing ever came out from it. So, I don't know. Cool

31:11.120 --> 31:18.000
that there's going to be a new Pikmin game. Um, I don't really know what, I don't know. I guess

31:18.000 --> 31:24.240
we'll find out what it's about, but I'm not excited about Pikmin. I, I, I couldn't really.

31:24.240 --> 31:28.560
Some of those series I just kind of missed because I was never really, you know, I didn't get into

31:28.560 --> 31:34.800
the, it wasn't the first one on the 64. Was it a GameCube? I think they're both GameCube. I just

31:34.800 --> 31:39.200
missed the boat on Pikmin. I understand people really love it, but, um, it's one of the series

31:39.200 --> 31:44.480
I never got to play. I was too busy with F-Zero. Let's put it that way. That'd be cool if they

31:44.480 --> 31:49.120
announced an F-Zero game for the Wii U. Don't tease me. Well, moving on, if you're not a Nintendo

31:49.120 --> 31:54.240
fan, maybe you're more of a Microsoft person and you will be excited by the news of Halo 4.

31:54.880 --> 32:00.320
Or maybe not. Some people aren't happy with the whole, like, Halo is still continuing without

32:00.320 --> 32:05.440
Bungie. It's, you know, but, you know, these things are gonna happen. Uh, Microsoft did announce

32:05.440 --> 32:13.200
that Halo 4 is going to launch worldwide Tuesday, November 6th. Um, funny that they did the whole,

32:13.200 --> 32:18.320
uh, integration with Conan O'Brien. Like, they, there was a long segment on the Conan show on TBS,

32:18.320 --> 32:23.200
like, nine minutes, kind of, about Halo and some funny voice, like, they were, you know,

32:23.200 --> 32:27.120
the background guys doing moving or something. That was a little silly. I think it's in the

32:27.120 --> 32:32.320
game. I do too. I mean, it was very red versus blue to me, but it was cool because it was Conan

32:32.320 --> 32:38.160
and Andy Richter who are both awesome. Um, so of course there's the whole little corporate speak of,

32:38.160 --> 32:42.880
with Halo 4 leading the charge, we're confident 2012 will be the most successful year in Xbox

32:42.880 --> 32:49.440
history. Uh, we are beginning a new saga with Halo 4 and embarking on a journey that will encompass

32:49.440 --> 32:55.840
the next decade of Halo games and experiences. Confirmed, Halo 4, 5, and 6. Right there.

32:56.480 --> 33:03.280
Confirmed. And 7, and 8, and 9. Of course, to be fair, they already said in a while,

33:03.280 --> 33:07.200
this Halo 4 will be the first game in a new trilogy. So it really, as much as I'm,

33:07.200 --> 33:10.400
you know, being sarcastic, it really isn't in the news. Honestly, I don't see a problem with

33:10.400 --> 33:14.320
the new Halo game coming out without Bungie. Yeah, I understand that Bungie was, you know,

33:14.320 --> 33:18.960
kind of the driving force behind the last set of games, because obviously they're the

33:18.960 --> 33:25.120
kind of creators of it. But, I mean, look at Call of Duty. I mean, perfect example. I mean, I know

33:25.120 --> 33:30.400
Infinity Ward kind of was behind some of the really big Call of Duty games, and yeah, I could

33:30.400 --> 33:34.480
see that even though Infinity Ward, you know, I mean, in name there's still Infinity Ward,

33:34.480 --> 33:39.360
but, you know, most of the talent's kind of gone. Um, or the original talent, I guess,

33:39.360 --> 33:46.720
they're still talented people there. But, um, it hasn't hurt sales at all. So I don't think that

33:46.720 --> 33:50.720
the fact that Halo 4 is going to come from a different studio, that there's going to be any

33:50.720 --> 33:55.360
less quality in the game. I think, if anything, it could be just like kind of fresh eyes on it,

33:55.360 --> 34:01.200
I guess. It looks cool, just like the brief little snippets of things that they have on there.

34:01.200 --> 34:05.760
I'd be curious to at least check it out. I've kind of stopped with the Halo series since Halo 3. I

34:05.760 --> 34:09.840
haven't cared about all the other little Halo games that have come out, but I'm, you know,

34:09.840 --> 34:14.160
I'm pretty shitty at first-person shooters, but I'm good enough at Mass Effect where suddenly

34:14.160 --> 34:18.080
my ego's like, maybe I can play first-person shooters again, even though Halo doesn't have

34:18.080 --> 34:24.400
a throw. Um, uh, some of our chatters, actdeftachat.org, says, I'm an Xbox person,

34:24.400 --> 34:30.640
I'm not excited about Halo at all. Gamergirl says, Halo is overplayed, just saying. Porkchop says,

34:30.640 --> 34:36.160
Halo needs a kick to the crotch. One way to kill Master Chef, and Chef is not a typo.

34:37.040 --> 34:41.760
I was like, surely he meant to say Chief. Uh, Technus says, I like Halo. It's not the shit

34:41.760 --> 34:46.400
everybody wants to believe it is. Oh, it's not, it's not the shit. I think that means like, yeah,

34:46.400 --> 34:50.400
you're the shit. It's not the shit everybody wants to believe it is, but I won't knock it. I think

34:50.400 --> 34:55.840
that's kind of how I feel about Halo. Like, I'm not going to like, oh my God, melt fanboy Halo,

34:55.840 --> 35:00.480
but it's a decent series. There's a reason why it propelled the Xbox the way it did. It was a

35:00.480 --> 35:04.480
great first person shooter, especially on the original Xbox. And it still is. I mean, and what,

35:05.600 --> 35:09.440
I mean, I don't think that they're doing another Gears of War game. Well, I'm sure

35:09.440 --> 35:15.200
they'll find a way. They'll find a way, but supposedly Gears of War is really, really dead

35:15.200 --> 35:19.600
and ain't coming back. Now, here's one other thing I want to say about this before we go on

35:19.600 --> 35:24.800
to the next story. November 6th is the day that the game is coming out. The first Tuesday of

35:24.800 --> 35:34.960
November. Is there anything else really big every four years, especially that people might kind of

35:34.960 --> 35:40.400
be caring about this year? A lot of passion around it has nothing to do with video games.

35:40.400 --> 35:45.440
I don't think Call of Duty comes out that day. No, no. It's called election day here in the US.

35:45.440 --> 35:50.160
That's right. It's election day. We have this guy, the president. You ever heard the name

35:50.160 --> 35:55.200
Barack Obama? Yeah, Barack Obama. I don't listen to that hip hop music. OK,

35:58.160 --> 36:04.720
well, it's it's it's the leader of our country. And, you know, that's a pretty amazing title

36:04.720 --> 36:10.320
for a hip hop artist. He has to run for office again because there's somebody else named Mitt

36:10.320 --> 36:16.320
Romney that thinks he shouldn't be president. That's a terrible hip hop name. All right,

36:16.320 --> 36:21.280
movie. Look, it's not a politics show and it's not a porn show. Just an interesting observation.

36:21.280 --> 36:26.080
But I guess Microsoft got called on it and it was very light. You know,

36:26.080 --> 36:28.560
the statement they kind of released was like, well,

36:28.560 --> 36:32.400
we think a lot of people will be excited about both, you know, whatever.

36:33.040 --> 36:37.920
Right. Yes. Let us hold our release of our game so you can have your little election

36:37.920 --> 36:43.680
or we can just move on like the rest of the world is. Let's be real. In this day and age,

36:43.680 --> 36:48.240
you can vote absentee and Amazon delivers to your door. There you go. You don't have to

36:48.240 --> 36:53.760
leave the house to participate in democracy or fragging online. I mean, absentee voting

36:53.760 --> 36:58.160
takes like a few minutes. I'd like to vote in person. I personally don't vote. How about

36:58.160 --> 37:07.040
putting those voting booths inside GameStop or no. Or or another retailer. All right,

37:07.040 --> 37:12.880
mall. That would actually be a really good idea. You think get more young voters go to

37:12.880 --> 37:17.600
Claire's then go vote? Why not? They should have they should have them at the mall.

37:17.600 --> 37:21.600
Jamba man, free smoothie with your vote. I could get a Cinnabon while I vote.

37:22.400 --> 37:25.600
See, that's a lot better than going to the Lutheran Church around the corner from my

37:25.600 --> 37:31.040
house. That is true. I do feel like I have to go to the grade school to vote here and I don't have

37:31.040 --> 37:35.920
kids. So I feel really awkward going to make you sit down at the really small desk. You have to go

37:35.920 --> 37:40.720
in the library and I'm like, I'm a big person in the library. I'm hitting my head on the ceiling.

37:40.720 --> 37:45.760
Yeah, I don't know. It feels awkward. Like like guys like me aren't supposed to be hanging around

37:45.760 --> 37:50.720
elementary schools unless I have kids and I don't. So what's my excuse? And again, I have to go to

37:50.720 --> 37:54.800
the Lutheran Church to drop mine off. So I think I'm going to burst into flames or something.

37:55.760 --> 38:00.320
You get to vote, then you get some Kool-Aid. All right. Moving on. Moving on. Dark Sakura,

38:00.880 --> 38:06.720
take us to a new story. Well, for those of us who are blessed with iPhones, we have a great game

38:06.720 --> 38:10.400
coming up for iOS, although I have no idea how the fuck we're going to play it. I'm sorry. Can

38:10.400 --> 38:15.440
I read some great chat comments real quick? Um, Infinel, I love this comment in chat room.

38:15.440 --> 38:20.800
If corporations are people, can I vote Valve for president? Game Guru says, can I vote for

38:20.800 --> 38:24.960
Master Chief as my president? Good, good way to tie the stories together. Appreciate that. Well,

38:24.960 --> 38:29.360
you know who I usually write in? Bill the Cat. I've been doing this show with you for 10 years.

38:29.360 --> 38:34.880
I know Bill the Cat very well. Why don't they just call, you know, Obama Master Chief,

38:34.880 --> 38:39.600
you know what I mean? Cause it's, I would call him my Master Chief. He is, he is Master in Chief.

38:39.600 --> 38:44.240
What do they call it? Chief. Here's how you win this. You put Obama in your fucking campaign.

38:44.240 --> 38:48.160
Obama comes in, you know, dressed up like Master Chief, kicks down a door,

38:48.160 --> 38:52.720
pulls off his helmet and said, go vote. And that'll get people in there. That's kind of how

38:52.720 --> 38:57.600
the Bin Laden speech went down. But anyway, I don't remember him being in the Master Chief.

38:57.600 --> 39:01.520
Oh wait, that was, that was when they made fun of him on late night. All right. No politics.

39:01.520 --> 39:05.760
Moving on. So anyway, this awesome game I'm referring to is Marvel versus Capcom 2,

39:05.760 --> 39:12.480
and it's going to be on iOS on April 25th. I've only got the British price, which is a £2.99,

39:13.200 --> 39:20.480
but I'm assuming it's going to be a $5 game on, over in the US. I said, there's nothing yet

39:20.480 --> 39:26.320
announced as an upgraded version for iPad and it doesn't show the virtual D-pad on the screen.

39:27.120 --> 39:33.600
So, who knows exactly how it's going to control, but hey. The virtual D-pad is paid to unlock

39:33.600 --> 39:41.200
content. On top of that, it has all 56 fighters from the, uh, original. That was nice of Capcom

39:41.200 --> 39:48.000
to do for a change. You fucking know they thought about it. You know, there was that guy in the

39:48.000 --> 39:52.960
boardroom. We could have, you know, eight characters that come with it. And then for 99

39:52.960 --> 40:00.240
cents, do eight more and eight more. You know what? Meh. But for, for real Marvel versus Capcom

40:00.240 --> 40:08.000
2 on the iPhone, if I had an iCade for the iPad, if I had, which I don't think is on tonight's

40:08.000 --> 40:14.560
show, so I'll say it, that Midway game on the iOS devices, that Midway arcade treasures got support

40:14.560 --> 40:22.240
for the iCade this week. Yes, very yes. Good idea. That helped that game immensely. So iCade support

40:22.240 --> 40:26.640
for Marvel versus Capcom 2 would make it, you know, for those that don't own anything else,

40:26.640 --> 40:31.440
I guess, so make it desirable. You know what I want iCade to make? I want them to make those

40:31.440 --> 40:37.840
little miniature arcade cabinets like they had in the 80s. Yeah, so yeah, with the LEDs and everything.

40:37.840 --> 40:41.280
Yeah, oh yeah. I want them to make like little cabinets like that. I should make one. I had a

40:41.280 --> 40:44.400
friend of mine that had a Donkey Kong little LED game like that. I had a friend that had the pipe man.

40:45.840 --> 40:53.680
You know, I actually have a Frogger cabinet like that, like one of the really small LED ones,

40:53.680 --> 40:58.080
that I actually was going to convert into a MAME cabinet. I remember when you bought that. That was

40:58.080 --> 41:01.920
your whole hundred dollar project, wasn't it? No, I didn't buy that. I actually got that free from a

41:01.920 --> 41:10.080
co-worker. No, but I have the internals for it. I have a Pico ITX board and a tiny little LCD screen.

41:10.640 --> 41:14.160
That would be awesome-tastic. The only problem is there's no room to put the controls on there

41:14.160 --> 41:20.240
because you realize you're all, yeah, I can't really fit buttons on this thing. See, that's what

41:20.240 --> 41:25.680
I was thinking, you know, Dan should do with his Transformer tablet because it's an Android

41:25.680 --> 41:32.400
and you can get a MAME for Android is to set that up. But yeah, that's another story. Just don't buy

41:32.400 --> 41:38.400
an iPad, I mean, for arcade games. Buy an arcade cabinet for arcade games. I mean, seriously,

41:38.960 --> 41:41.840
you're going to be spending about the same amount of money. You might as well have the authentic.

41:41.840 --> 41:46.080
That's true. That burger time I was looking at was $500. That's how much an iPad would cost.

41:46.080 --> 41:49.360
Well, I wanted an iPad for stuff other than games and besides that it's not coming out,

41:49.360 --> 41:53.040
this isn't coming out on iPad. Not like I don't already have like three other copies of it anyway,

41:53.760 --> 41:58.880
but still. Gonna take you for a ride. All right, let's move on with some more news.

42:00.080 --> 42:06.240
All right, so let's talk a little bit more Nintendo. And so there was this whole Nintendo

42:06.240 --> 42:12.000
Direct little press conference thing that they did in Japan and they made some announcements.

42:12.000 --> 42:15.200
First off, Animal Crossing is coming out this year on the 3DS. Well, it makes sense, you know,

42:15.200 --> 42:19.600
they got to have a game coming out for the fall. And no one is surprised. Um, so it is coming out

42:19.600 --> 42:23.760
in Japan. No word on the US, but probably coming out around the same time. I know you're very

42:23.760 --> 42:27.920
cynical about Animal Crossing and you could give two shits about the improved park bench sitting

42:27.920 --> 42:32.720
or whatever features they're actually adding into this one. However, I have a friend, a real person

42:32.720 --> 42:38.720
that I know that said, holy shit, Animal Crossing is coming out. Time to get a 3DS. Shit you not.

42:39.360 --> 42:43.520
Animal Crossing has its fans. They are loyal. I understand, you know, it's just like, you know,

42:43.520 --> 42:48.880
Apple, I product fans were like, holy shit, Apple has a new thing coming out. I got to go get it.

42:48.880 --> 42:53.120
I mean, it's just, it's just like this. I was just glad that she spoke to me in that

42:53.120 --> 43:00.720
language for a change and didn't say, well, I hope that when she plays it, she discovers a

43:00.720 --> 43:05.920
really makes a lot more sense in the Japanese version, a wholly unique experience and not,

43:05.920 --> 43:11.040
you know, the same damn game again. Do you know, I found my cop, my Japanese Animal Crossing.

43:11.040 --> 43:17.600
Okay. Since you brought up porn a long time ago, here's why this is funny because okay.

43:17.600 --> 43:21.360
And the Japanese version of Animal Crossing, it's actually saying the little, little symbols

43:21.360 --> 43:25.600
really fast. And because the way Japanese works, it's like the little animals are saying the word

43:25.600 --> 43:30.080
it's a syllabic language, but because English is such a stupid language, all they can do is

43:30.080 --> 43:34.560
say the letters really fast, you know? So they, they do say, they say like ABC, you have to,

43:34.560 --> 43:38.720
you know, they're saying it really fast, but it's really funny because like, if you put in words,

43:38.720 --> 43:46.720
like, fuck, you know, it's a little animal say it's really fun to put in dirty words and hear

43:46.720 --> 43:52.400
how the little animals interpret them. Anyhow, sorry for dumbing down the show.

43:54.160 --> 43:59.920
Okay. Um, they also announced that they're going to be doing a Kirby 20th anniversary edition on

43:59.920 --> 44:05.520
the Wii. So if you're even mildly interested in it, I would recommend picking it up. Cause if

44:05.520 --> 44:10.800
anything, you remember those Mario, at least this time, you're recommending this. You can't be right.

44:10.800 --> 44:15.920
Look, Hey, no recommending this because of the resale value of the last Mario game. And

44:15.920 --> 44:21.920
last Mario game was a stupid rom convert. It literally was a rom from the SMU. They're like,

44:21.920 --> 44:27.840
Hey, we're going to just snap, you know, put this virtual console rom on that disc done.

44:27.840 --> 44:33.200
No disrespect to the Kirby fans. It's a great franchise. However, you know, they did this with

44:33.200 --> 44:36.880
Mario. They did it with Zelda back on the GameCube. It was a pre-order bonus only thing. So

44:37.520 --> 44:42.720
it was basically virtual console on a disc. And now if they get some ones that we haven't seen

44:42.720 --> 44:47.280
elsewhere out on there, it'll be kind of awesome. Yeah. It would be neat if they were, I don't know,

44:47.280 --> 44:50.720
redone, but I think it's just a bunch of virtual console games. At least this time, it's not going

44:50.720 --> 44:55.440
to be just one rom. Um, so that'd be kind of neat. Nowhere to when that's coming out,

44:55.440 --> 45:05.360
but sometime he's here and Super Mario brothers, um, or new Super Mario brothers two is now coming,

45:05.360 --> 45:12.160
uh, this August, both Japan and the U S and looks exactly like new Super Mario brothers one,

45:13.200 --> 45:22.400
but with now Raccoon Mario. Hooray. Raccoon's awesome. Raccoon or Tanuki? Raccoon. Cool.

45:22.400 --> 45:26.000
Maybe Tanuki. I thought the Tanuki suit was the most awesome. Actually, my favorite was the hammer

45:26.000 --> 45:30.800
brother suit. I'm just glad though that they have stuck with the same backgrounds from the first

45:30.800 --> 45:37.520
games so that, you know, Josh's room is still current because it's actually that, that looks

45:37.520 --> 45:42.560
like Josh's room except different patterns of the mountains. Is it sad that it seriously took

45:42.560 --> 45:46.640
me a minute because my first reaction when they announced the sequel was I was like,

45:46.640 --> 45:52.720
Holy shit already. We just had Mario three D land last year. And then I was like, Oh wait,

45:52.720 --> 45:58.320
it's not a sequel to the three D game. This is a sequel on the D three DS to the Wii game.

45:59.120 --> 46:04.480
Like my brain actually had to go through those actually to the DS game that was on the DS. What

46:04.480 --> 46:08.720
the hell was the Wii game then? The Wii game was kind of the same damn thing. Just new Super Mario

46:08.720 --> 46:14.080
brothers. We noticed the Wii at the end. That was actually the first game that they didn't think

46:14.080 --> 46:19.200
about getting a three DS confirmed. I don't understand Nintendo. Well, all you have to

46:19.200 --> 46:25.680
understand is they took the game and they made some new levels and made some blinged out characters

46:25.680 --> 46:30.960
because there's a level with all gold characters for some reason. Oh, and spider webs. That must

46:30.960 --> 46:36.640
be new, right? I don't know. It's okay. By the way, I want to point out. Alan has paraded out

46:36.640 --> 46:41.680
here just to hand me to do nothing, but he's, he hasn't even been sitting here. He's been sitting

46:41.680 --> 46:46.640
in the back room playing mass effect. He walked out here specifically just to hand me the DS

46:46.640 --> 46:56.240
cartridge of new Super Mario brothers as if to say here, dumb ass. Thank you, honey. Thank you.

46:57.360 --> 47:03.760
Thank you. I learned so much being with you. I'm putting this up on our, on our page. So yeah,

47:03.760 --> 47:07.440
new Super Mario brothers. It's kind of weird though that is coming out in August. I mean,

47:08.240 --> 47:11.520
so that means that Nintendo does have something else that they're going to be releasing

47:11.520 --> 47:15.840
for the fourth quarter. Oh, I know it's a new console. That's it. That's what they're releasing

47:16.400 --> 47:20.240
that and probably animal crossing because animal crossing is somewhat cracky.

47:22.400 --> 47:26.480
But yeah, anyways, as I was alluding to earlier, I believe that the Wii

47:26.480 --> 47:29.360
Mario game that we've been putting out is going to be new Super Mario brothers

47:30.160 --> 47:36.960
two for the Wii U and that you're going to be able to integrate or not integrate, but play the game

47:36.960 --> 47:41.920
on your 3DS and on your console because the 3DS they will probably announce will actually be a

47:41.920 --> 47:50.480
link up with your Wii U to do this type of cross game play stuff that they did on the Wii and the

47:51.920 --> 48:01.200
Nintendo DS, but to a lesser extent because the Wii U, the controller looks like the bottom half

48:01.200 --> 48:07.360
of a 3DS. Yep. Except the new 3DS that they probably will announce that we'll have two

48:07.360 --> 48:13.280
analog six and not just one. Let's hope and no attachment later on, please. That would kind of

48:13.280 --> 48:17.680
piss me off, especially if it's exclusive to GameStop. Quickie poll. What? Kuriboh Shoe or

48:17.680 --> 48:22.640
Hammer Brothers Shoe. Um, Kuriboh Shoe all the way. That was like the raddest power up ever.

48:22.640 --> 48:28.480
The Hammer Brothers Shoe sucks. It's Frog Mario. Actually, Frog Mario sucks too. Frog Mario is

48:28.480 --> 48:32.640
balls unless you're in an underwater level. I will say that it is a challenge. I am very,

48:32.640 --> 48:37.840
if somebody can beat the game with Frog Mario through the level eight worlds, color me impressed.

48:37.840 --> 48:41.280
Frog Mario actually is very good in one of the level eight ones, the battleships.

48:42.240 --> 48:46.320
One of them is like an underwater battleship or something, isn't it? You can, well, it's all

48:46.320 --> 48:50.080
water, but you can, it's actually good for doing the high jumps over the, I'm just saying. We're

48:50.080 --> 48:56.480
talking strategy for a 23 year old game. Just saying. All right. Kuriboh Shoe by the way,

48:56.480 --> 49:01.280
all the way. Thank you. Nothing about light tromping some flowers. Why hasn't that made

49:01.280 --> 49:08.080
it into Mario Kart as a power up? Just a big shoe that stomps. Exactly. Just like your cart turns

49:08.080 --> 49:14.800
into the shoe. That's an awesome power up. Your cart turns into the shoe and it just flies ahead

49:14.800 --> 49:20.320
and stomps on whoever's in front of you and you just take off from there. Oh my God. Nintendo

49:20.320 --> 49:28.240
patent pending. Can't do it. Nintendo hire us. Hire us. Hire us. Hire us. Hire us.

49:28.240 --> 49:32.560
It would be a cool idea. Confirm next week. Oh, LR on the Nintendo network. I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

49:32.560 --> 49:39.920
Kidding. Put the hate mail down. Yeah. And then last thing, the 3DS is finally getting with

49:40.800 --> 49:45.680
iOS and everybody else, you know, Hey, they figured up, you know, you might like to sort

49:45.680 --> 49:50.720
your icons that you have. Um, so they're going to have a new addition to the home menu where

49:50.720 --> 49:57.520
you can create folders and store up to 60 icons within each folder. So that is awesome. You can

49:57.520 --> 50:04.960
actually kind of sort your games and whatnot. Neat. I like that idea. It's needed. That'll

50:04.960 --> 50:11.200
become an April 25th. The things I don't play folder. Let's have that for all the little NES

50:11.200 --> 50:14.080
games and the Game Boy Advance games I downloaded cause they were free and I don't play them.

50:14.080 --> 50:22.960
There are some I do play, but some I don't. So anyhow, let's move on with some more news.

50:22.960 --> 50:27.040
You know, there's a lot of great Nintendo happy-go-lucky news this week, but somebody

50:27.040 --> 50:34.320
is not so happy-go-lucky about what's going on in Nintendo. And that would be Trent Oster. Who is

50:34.320 --> 50:39.440
he? He's with Beamdog. And he went to Twitter this week to say Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition,

50:39.440 --> 50:44.080
not coming to the Wii U. Ironically, I'd never would have thought that game was coming to the

50:44.080 --> 50:49.120
Wii U. I, yeah, I'm like, I never would have put it, but you know, for whatever reason,

50:49.120 --> 50:55.920
he was asked and he said, we don't do Nintendo development. Previous experience with Nintendo

50:55.920 --> 51:04.400
was enough to ensure there will not be another Nintendo project. Oh no, he did. He just basically

51:04.400 --> 51:10.960
said, worked with Nintendo before, not going to happen again. Apparently it has to do with MDK 2.

51:10.960 --> 51:15.440
You remember MDK from back in the day, there was MDK 2. It was supposed to be WiiWare. There was a

51:15.440 --> 51:22.400
6,000 unit sales requirement before the developer gets payment. I could see where that's kind of

51:22.400 --> 51:28.080
crappy. Also had to do with trying to get a 400 meg game down to 40 megs with WiiWare. You know,

51:28.080 --> 51:32.080
I can see where, you know, if you don't like the rules, then I'm going to take my ball and go

51:32.080 --> 51:38.800
somewhere else and that's fine. They honestly need to like, you know, rethink their whole strategy

51:38.800 --> 51:44.720
with their online games because they are a little bit restrictive and, you know, the exposure on

51:44.720 --> 51:50.720
WiiWare isn't very good. Well, this whole Nintendo Direct before E3 is very interesting to me

51:50.720 --> 51:55.680
because, you know, E3 is only, what, about six weeks away at this point? And for Nintendo to have

51:55.680 --> 51:59.600
this kind of a major press conference before E3 is very interesting because these are games they

51:59.600 --> 52:03.680
very easily could have kept in their hat until E3, with the exception of the firmware update. You

52:03.680 --> 52:08.960
know, that's really the only thing that's happening now. I honestly, I mean, it's just like if they

52:08.960 --> 52:13.760
came out and go, new Super Mario Brothers 2! I would have been like, told ya! I mean, it's

52:13.760 --> 52:17.120
seriously, did they call it like last year? Oh hey, they're going to have a new Super Mario

52:17.120 --> 52:20.880
Brothers game. Here's the thing though, here's what it is, because E3 is going to focus solely

52:20.880 --> 52:25.200
on the Wii U. You know, again, no shock. That's Nintendo's big thing and that's the system

52:25.200 --> 52:29.280
they're launching, so that's why they got all this 3DS stuff out of the way, so that they can

52:29.280 --> 52:33.360
literally spend five minutes talking about 3DS and then the rest of the time talking about Wii U.

52:33.360 --> 52:37.840
I think the launch with the Zelda game. I think that's going to be their launch game.

52:37.840 --> 52:41.680
Really? I think this Mario game's it, buddy. I think that's your game.

52:43.520 --> 52:44.000
If it is-

52:44.000 --> 52:46.080
Zelda in 2013. Maybe.

52:46.080 --> 52:51.840
Uh, the only reason I think Zelda, because Zelda would show off a new engine a lot better than

52:51.840 --> 52:56.960
Mario would. Mario, you kind of are keeping it cartoony, and who gives a shit if it's an HD,

52:56.960 --> 53:02.000
it's going to still look like a fucking Mario game. Whereas a Zelda game in HD looks a lot better.

53:02.000 --> 53:09.200
Yeah. Well, um, also one thing I wanted to say is that one thing that Nintendo didn't detail here,

53:09.200 --> 53:14.160
that they're going to have to detail at E3, is the Nintendo network. We still don't really know,

53:14.160 --> 53:17.600
I mean, we've heard some little things about it, we don't really know what that entails.

53:17.600 --> 53:19.600
And I think E3 is going to be a big reveal for that.

53:19.600 --> 53:20.480
And they don't know either.

53:22.160 --> 53:23.200
I wouldn't put it past them.

53:23.200 --> 53:29.920
So hey guys, we have this poll on our website, we want you to vote on what exactly you want the

53:29.920 --> 53:31.440
Nintendo network to be.

53:31.440 --> 53:36.720
Brakeman in chat makes a pretty good point. Spoiler alert, Gears of War 4 also not going to be on the

53:36.720 --> 53:38.400
Wii U. Sorry everyone.

53:41.280 --> 53:45.920
That's true, and you probably won't see, you know, God of War coming to the Wii U anytime soon

53:45.920 --> 53:47.600
either, you know, it's just the way these things work.

53:48.480 --> 53:50.560
Halo 4, not on the Wii U.

53:50.560 --> 53:54.320
Halo 4, not on the Wii U. That's right, not on the Wii U.

53:54.320 --> 53:57.200
Not on the Wii U. Until there's, until there's,

53:57.840 --> 54:00.960
someday one of them is going to gobble the other up. Just wait.

54:01.600 --> 54:05.520
It's just like Sega. Who would have thought Sega would be publishing on an Nintendo platform?

54:05.520 --> 54:06.080
That's right.

54:07.040 --> 54:11.120
Minds were blown when Sonic showed up on the NES system. It was crazy.

54:11.760 --> 54:12.320
I cried.

54:13.280 --> 54:14.080
Aww.

54:14.080 --> 54:14.560
Not really.

54:15.360 --> 54:16.480
All right, moving on.

54:16.480 --> 54:20.960
Dark Sakura. Well, Final Fantasy 14, they're desperate.

54:20.960 --> 54:25.360
They really, really, really, really want everyone to come back.

54:26.160 --> 54:27.440
They're just crying over it.

54:28.320 --> 54:33.440
So basically, anyone who has an inactive Final Fantasy 14 account can come back for a 10-day

54:33.440 --> 54:35.920
free trial next month, according to Squeenix.

54:37.680 --> 54:43.440
They said it's going to be free of charge between the 10th and 21st of May with a new job system,

54:43.440 --> 54:50.400
7th Umbral Era content, and new gameplay that has a new update.

54:52.720 --> 54:56.160
And then for the people that are still playing, they're getting some goodies.

54:56.160 --> 55:03.680
Anyone who's been subscribed for 90 days between January 6th and the 2.0 beta testing

55:04.560 --> 55:09.840
gets their subscription released to, well this is in pounds because I'm reading off a British

55:09.840 --> 55:19.440
article, to £6.89 down from £8.99. And they are legacy subscribers and they get a new Chocobo.

55:20.240 --> 55:20.740
Ooh.

55:22.960 --> 55:28.400
But they also, they were still cutting down on their servers, so they're desperate. Desperate!

55:28.400 --> 55:33.280
The problem is though, who cares that they're offering a free, you know, come back and try us

55:33.280 --> 55:37.840
for 10 days? Because it's not the 2.0 update yet! That doesn't happen until the fall! So why do I

55:37.840 --> 55:39.520
want to play your half-finished game?

55:39.520 --> 55:46.000
Well, to be fair, I mean I give Final Fantasy 14 its fair share of shit. I did play it,

55:46.000 --> 55:51.040
I did play it for a while so I can speak as a former player, as someone who would be directly

55:51.040 --> 55:56.560
impacted by this. They have put some things into the game already that were needed and that was

55:57.440 --> 56:03.600
Final Fantasy classes that people understand, to put it lightly. Like now instead of Thaumaturge

56:03.600 --> 56:09.920
and Conjurer, you can path to Black Mage and White Mage and you know, some of those changes

56:09.920 --> 56:16.240
are actually pretty exciting. Not enough to get me back. Well, I should say, you know, if it's

56:16.240 --> 56:21.600
going to be free for 10 days, if I'm not, what weekend is this happening again? I kind of shut

56:21.600 --> 56:22.160
my brain off for a minute.

56:22.160 --> 56:29.440
Crap. Let me look back at it. It says it is the 10th and 21st of May.

56:29.440 --> 56:33.760
See, here's the problem. What's happening on the 15th of May?

56:34.720 --> 56:35.360
Disneyland?

56:36.400 --> 56:38.880
For you. What's happening on the 15th of May for everybody else?

56:39.760 --> 56:40.800
Max Payne 3?

56:40.800 --> 56:42.640
Diablo 3, people.

56:42.640 --> 56:43.280
True.

56:43.280 --> 56:45.360
Diablo 3 is on May 15th.

56:46.400 --> 56:46.720
Why is this-

56:46.720 --> 56:50.400
Do you think I give a shit about Final Fantasy 14 while I'm in the middle of Diablo 3?

56:50.400 --> 56:53.600
Why does this make me think of like Cabela's and the Halo 3 launch?

56:54.160 --> 56:58.480
So let's be real, there's really a four-day window to play Final Fantasy 14.

56:58.480 --> 56:59.760
Just keeping it real, folks.

57:01.120 --> 57:03.920
And so maybe if it's not-

57:03.920 --> 57:08.480
Because, you know, if the patch is seven gigs, I have to think about,

57:08.480 --> 57:11.840
oh, I have a 250 gig through Comcast and I got to download Diablo.

57:11.840 --> 57:13.680
I hate that I have to fucking think about that, but I do.

57:14.320 --> 57:18.560
So, you know, if it's reasonable, I'll check it out. Why not?

57:18.560 --> 57:19.200
If it's free.

57:20.800 --> 57:22.720
But I kind of don't think it's going to sway my opinion.

57:23.600 --> 57:27.600
Porkchop in our chat room asks, does Final Fantasy 14 have much of a soundtrack?

57:27.600 --> 57:28.960
Um, yeah, it's decent.

57:28.960 --> 57:33.040
I believe Nobui Matsu did a large chunk of the tracks,

57:33.040 --> 57:36.240
which is strange because he didn't really do Eleven's soundtrack at all, except the theme.

57:36.240 --> 57:37.760
Just bring Eleven free-to-play.

57:37.760 --> 57:39.280
That's all you need to do.

57:39.280 --> 57:40.000
Right?

57:40.000 --> 57:42.320
All you need is Eleven in the free-to-play, I'd be there.

57:42.320 --> 57:43.760
I would be there today.

57:43.760 --> 57:45.760
You know why Eleven can't go free-to-play?

57:45.760 --> 57:48.320
It's the Japanese user base on PlayStation 2.

57:48.320 --> 57:50.800
How can you have a free-to-play game on the PlayStation 2 at this point?

57:51.440 --> 57:51.920
You can't.

57:51.920 --> 57:52.640
Cut him out!

57:54.080 --> 57:55.200
Okay, yeah.

57:55.200 --> 57:58.160
No, seriously, how long is the PlayStation? Okay, fine.

57:58.160 --> 58:01.120
The PlayStation 2 still has some game coming out.

58:01.120 --> 58:04.560
To be fair, there's like five people on Xbox 360 too.

58:04.560 --> 58:05.440
Let's not forget that.

58:05.440 --> 58:06.240
That was a pretty big deal.

58:06.240 --> 58:07.280
Oh, oh, yeah.

58:07.280 --> 58:11.040
Let's, let's keep them up for the five people that play on Xbox 360.

58:11.040 --> 58:13.680
Oh, but all those people play EA Sports MMA.

58:13.680 --> 58:14.320
Fuck them.

58:14.320 --> 58:15.280
Or Need for Speed.

58:15.280 --> 58:16.480
Ah, fuck them too.

58:16.480 --> 58:17.120
You know what?

58:17.120 --> 58:19.440
All those five people there playing Final Fantasy.

58:19.440 --> 58:21.200
Who gives a shit?

58:21.200 --> 58:21.760
You know what?

58:21.760 --> 58:24.160
Tell them, listen, go download the PC client for free,

58:24.160 --> 58:25.520
because it's free to fucking play.

58:26.480 --> 58:26.960
You know what?

58:26.960 --> 58:28.320
Some people, though, do like that.

58:28.320 --> 58:31.040
I mean, like, we have IKUMA right now saying that it's good now.

58:32.240 --> 58:36.160
I mean, okay, if you have a PlayStation 2 and you're still playing on that game,

58:36.160 --> 58:37.440
get a new PC.

58:37.440 --> 58:38.320
I mean, come on.

58:38.320 --> 58:40.560
A PC from, like, a few years.

58:40.560 --> 58:43.760
Shit, you could probably get a PC from, like, what is it?

58:43.760 --> 58:46.720
How long has it been since I've been playing Final Fantasy 11?

58:46.720 --> 58:47.600
Like, 10 years?

58:48.400 --> 58:49.200
It's been a while.

58:49.200 --> 58:50.240
Okay, come on.

58:50.240 --> 58:53.040
If you can't afford a PC from, like, 10 years ago,

58:53.040 --> 58:54.400
what the-

58:54.400 --> 58:58.480
It hasn't been 10 years, because, uh, this show is 10 years old,

58:58.480 --> 59:00.080
and the Final Fantasy 11 thing started.

59:00.080 --> 59:00.640
Okay, fine.

59:00.640 --> 59:01.360
Like, a couple years ago.

59:01.360 --> 59:03.680
Five to seven years ago, okay?

59:03.680 --> 59:04.800
Five to seven years ago.

59:04.800 --> 59:07.760
I literally am throwing away computers from that time.

59:07.760 --> 59:10.160
I will give you a computer for free.

59:10.160 --> 59:12.880
The computer that the show is broadcast from could play Final Fantasy 11.

59:12.880 --> 59:13.920
Oh, I mean, the fuck?

59:13.920 --> 59:16.480
There's probably this Vita could play Final Fantasy 11.

59:16.480 --> 59:17.600
That was a rumor.

59:17.600 --> 59:18.160
Remember?

59:18.160 --> 59:18.800
That was a rumor.

59:18.800 --> 59:19.920
They really knew to do that.

59:19.920 --> 59:20.480
That was a rumor.

59:20.480 --> 59:21.440
I would buy that.

59:21.440 --> 59:22.560
I would buy that shit.

59:22.560 --> 59:23.920
Well, maybe not on the Vita, because that'd be-

59:24.800 --> 59:26.080
No, I'd still buy that.

59:26.080 --> 59:28.320
But I'm telling you, Final Fantasy 11 would be awesome.

59:28.320 --> 59:29.280
Who cares about 14?

59:29.280 --> 59:29.840
Just listen.

59:29.840 --> 59:30.960
Okay, it didn't work out.

59:30.960 --> 59:32.000
We're gonna make it free to pl-

59:32.000 --> 59:34.240
You know, to make it up, we're gonna-

59:34.240 --> 59:36.960
We're gonna maybe revamp a little bit of Final Fantasy 11,

59:36.960 --> 59:37.440
and make free to play.

59:37.440 --> 59:41.680
There is too much pride for Square Enix,

59:41.680 --> 59:44.160
the makers of Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy,

59:45.200 --> 59:48.400
to say, we're gonna open this up free to play,

59:48.400 --> 59:51.120
and have to take that big old slice of humble pie.

59:51.120 --> 59:52.640
It ain't happening anytime soon.

59:54.960 --> 59:55.200
I don't think-

59:55.200 --> 59:55.920
I'll wait.

59:55.920 --> 59:59.200
I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing for your MMO to take that path.

59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.920
Why can't Final Fantasy go down the path of Guild Wars?

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.200
Anyway, forget it.

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:04.720
Because they're squeamics.

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:05.440
Let's move on.

01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:06.400
They don't do that.

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:10.160
Let's talk about games that are really existing in a store near you very soon,

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:12.720
as we travel around the world and look at some release dates.

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:13.220
Yay!

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:15.600
All right.

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:21.360
So, this week, it's Prototype 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360,

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:26.000
and on 360, Phantom Breaker Special Edition.

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:28.240
That's it.

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:29.440
Oh, and-

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:31.120
No, that's it.

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:31.920
Shifting-

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.240
Shifting World on 3DS.

01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:35.280
I didn't even have to look that shit up,

01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:36.640
because there are three titles!

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:37.200
Three!

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:38.800
It's getting a little slower.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:40.080
It'll pick back up during summer.

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:41.040
Yeah, I gave it a couple weeks.

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:42.560
How about Japan?

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:44.320
Let's check out Japan and see what's coming out of there.

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:48.080
On the 3DS this week, Shin Sangoku Musou Versus comes out.

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:52.640
That is pretty much the only big release, but that's coming out on the 26th.

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:54.480
I'm trying to figure out what this is.

01:00:54.480 --> 01:00:56.160
This is a Koei game.

01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:00.800
And I was trying to see if it was like Dynasty Warriors on the 3DS or something.

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:01.300
Yeah.

01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:01.920
3DS.

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:02.720
Kind of what it looks like.

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:04.260
Yeah.

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:06.960
So, that is coming out on the 3DS.

01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:09.680
Going to some of the other systems, checking out the Vita.

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:20.880
Vita has Seal No Surge, Ushinawatia Warita, sorry, Hoshi i Sasaguchi comes out this week

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:28.800
in Normal and Agent packs, as well as Next Revolution comes out for Media 5 this week.

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:30.160
Those are both on the Vita.

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:33.040
And checking out the consoles real quick.

01:01:33.040 --> 01:01:35.040
Going to the PlayStation 3.

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:37.600
Biohazard Operation Raccoon City.

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:42.960
You get a special headset bundle for Operation Raccoon City, the game itself.

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:43.600
It's coming out.

01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:46.320
And Loki's saying, don't fall for it, it sucks.

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:51.360
Also, what's very interesting, Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Game of the Year Edition,

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:54.160
finally coming out on PlayStation 3.

01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:57.920
Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition, finally coming out on PlayStation 3.

01:01:57.920 --> 01:01:59.040
Is that a new Idolmaster?

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:00.800
I think those are price reductions.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:05.200
And yes, the Idolmaster Graver for You Volume 7.

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:06.960
I think this is more an expansion for Idolmaster.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:09.440
I don't think it's an actual full on game.

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:13.440
I'm guessing that those are getting a price reduction because there was just recently

01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:19.040
a combo pack with Fallout 3 and Oblivion for like $29.99 or something.

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:20.240
That could be here in the States.

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:20.560
Yeah.

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:21.040
That could be.

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:23.840
Well that wasn't $360, but I can see them dropping prices.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:26.880
Oddly enough, $360 is pretty busy this week in Japan.

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:29.360
Operation Raccoon City Biohazard is out there as well.

01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:30.000
Sucks.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.360
Cybertroopers Virtual On Force gets the platinum reduction.

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:34.320
Yeah, I know, right?

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:35.920
Who knew Virtual On was still going?

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:41.520
I think that's the arcade game, plus they're throwing in the tournament stick or that arcade

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:42.480
stick that goes with it.

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:43.040
Need.

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:47.360
Dodonpachi Resurrection Black Label and It's a Cave Game is out this week.

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:48.240
That's probably a price reduction.

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:49.680
There's going to be a double pack.

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:51.200
Yeah, because it's called Cave Selection.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.120
Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition also on the Xbox 360.

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:56.240
It's Dodonpachi.

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:59.280
The Dodonpachi Resurrection came out like, what, six months ago?

01:02:59.280 --> 01:02:59.920
Yeah.

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:03.120
You saw the Akai Katana is coming out next month.

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:03.840
No, I missed that.

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:07.200
The new SHMUP or, yeah, it's a new SHMUP.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:10.080
It's actually one that's actually formatted for widescreen.

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:14.320
The first cave game for widescreen HD TVs, all done in HD.

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:15.040
Well done.

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:16.400
About time.

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:17.600
And it's coming out in the States.

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:20.800
You know what?

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:23.040
There's actually a game that's in talks with Square.

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:26.480
I don't know if we have anything in the show, but actually one thing I am interested that's

01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:29.840
coming out, hopefully, that Square is doing is a sequel to The World Ends With You.

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:31.280
Yes.

01:03:31.280 --> 01:03:32.560
They're talking about that.

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:33.520
They're supposed to be doing that.

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:33.840
Yeah.

01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:34.960
Good times.

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:35.840
Comes out December.

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:39.280
Oh, really?

01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:41.840
No, I'm just saying, wouldn't that be funny because of the Mayan calendar?

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:45.840
I thought that was one of your little like mochi tips slipping in there.

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:46.400
I don't know.

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:50.240
It's just funny because I don't think that our December on the Gregorian calendar would

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:51.760
have been the end of their year.

01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:56.240
You know, I actually, a little bit of trivia on the lunar calendar for the Jewish calendar,

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:57.840
we actually don't have a leap year.

01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:00.880
We have a leap month every, I think, 13 years.

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:02.160
So just saying.

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:03.760
I want a whole month.

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:04.800
You have a whole extra month.

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.400
Do you have to work in that month?

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:07.040
No.

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:07.600
Good time.

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.360
Well, I mean, it's normal stuff.

01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:10.800
You don't work on Shabbat.

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:13.680
Who would run the world then if we didn't work for a whole month?

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:16.720
You know, the Jew.

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:17.440
Anarchy!

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:19.920
Moving on.

01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:20.320
UK.

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:25.440
24th of April, we have FIFA 12, you for Euro 12.

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:29.760
The Walking Dead and Prototype 2.

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:32.720
There's a game that actually came out on my birthday that I think has a funny name, and

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:36.960
I have no idea what it's about, but it makes me think of Benicula as Botanicula.

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:41.120
I don't know if anyone ever remembers a book about the vegetarian vampire rabbit.

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:46.400
On the 26th of April is Deus Ex Human Revolution.

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:51.280
On the 27th binary domain, Blazing Souls Accolade, or is it Assolate?

01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:51.780
I don't know.

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:55.280
And Risen 2 Dark Watters.

01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:57.680
That would be it.

01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:00.160
That's all.

01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:01.940
All right.

01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:08.080
So I don't know if I should be happy about this, but I guess, you know, company doing

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.120
well, great.

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:13.680
THQ is, you know, their forecast for their earnings has improved.

01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:21.040
They're saying that now they're reporting a net sales of from 160 million to 170 million.

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:27.440
And of course their previous update was from 130 to 150.

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:31.040
So what can this be attributed to?

01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:37.040
Well, it's due to the fact that people have been dumb enough to buy the fucking DLC for

01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:38.160
Saints Row the Third.

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:42.480
And I am proud to say that I am not one of those people.

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:48.240
I made the mistake once purchasing one of their content packs or expansions, whatever

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:48.960
you want to call it.

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:51.600
And it sucked.

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:53.760
It was 30 minutes of content for $8.

01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:56.320
I'm sorry, $7.

01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:59.760
And I just said...

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:00.720
It's cheaper than a hooker.

01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:03.440
30 minutes?

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:08.320
Yeah, that is cheaper than a hooker, but it's definitely not as satisfying.

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:09.120
Not as much payoff.

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.320
When did you start pricing hookers?

01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:14.960
Don't get me started.

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:17.200
Is there something for your birthday I didn't hear about?

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:19.200
No, I actually...

01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:20.560
Nothing.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:23.200
This comes from the episode last week's Supernatural.

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:24.480
Of course.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:25.680
I was a fancy lady.

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:26.400
What, a hooker?

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:33.280
Well, I mean, come on, you have to know that you have to factor in the HMV into everything.

01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:37.440
I mean, everything's based off the HME, which is the hooker market value.

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:40.800
And if you don't know what the hooker market value is, how are you going to know how to

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:43.040
price your other goods that are based off the HMV?

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:46.960
I'm telling you, this is just street smarts.

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:47.760
I mean, seriously.

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:55.120
So yes, it's really unfortunate that people were dumb enough to buy this, and most of

01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:57.280
which was paid unlocked content, by the way.

01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:01.600
In fact, they're still putting out little costumes and bullshit that was in the game.

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:06.400
Sadly though, if they put out a sequel to this game, I'm probably not going to have

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:08.320
to buy it, because I do remember earlier...

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:15.600
Well, a couple weeks ago while we were out, or while I was out, a certain idiot from...

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:21.200
I'm not really sure if he works for THQ or Volition, I believe he works for THQ, was

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:25.840
complaining about, you know, I'm not getting enough money from used games.

01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:33.040
And so, of course, he had to be the first person to enter my list of, hey, if you complain

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:38.240
about used game sales and not making anything off of it, I'm going to boycott your game.

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:44.000
So Richard Brown, the first inductee into that list, who had worked on many things,

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.520
including Saints Row the Third.

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:49.520
Unfortunately, I am now going to have to be forced not to purchase any more games from...

01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:51.360
Are you seriously boycotting Saints Row the Third?

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:52.000
I don't believe it.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.120
I do not believe it.

01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:54.160
I'm not buying the game new.

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:57.920
They will not get any of my new money.

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:00.800
Nah, we'll wait till that first trailer is out and I'll ask you again.

01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:06.960
But yes, he has worked on many games, including Homefront, Renfaction, Armageddon, Saints

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:10.560
Row the Third, Stacking, Warhammer 40k, WWE All-Stars.

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:14.480
He's basically, I think he's like a producer or something like that over at THQ.

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:17.680
He backs the money for this stuff.

01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:26.320
So yes, and of course he came out bitching about how, you know, oh, they need used game

01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:28.560
sales because all these excuses.

01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:29.760
I don't know.

01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:35.600
I don't even really want to go into detail about it, but it's just, it's annoying.

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:40.560
Oh, he needs to talk about the real cost of used games and smuggle bastard.

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:42.800
Blah, blah, blah.

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:43.760
Blah, blah, blah.

01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:44.240
Who cares?

01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:50.720
Well, everybody has Kickstarter fever in the States anyway, because you know, they don't

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:52.400
really have anything like it overseas.

01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:54.240
Cause you know, by the way, I got to say this.

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:59.200
There was a great Penny Arcade article on Kickstarter this week about how, you know,

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:02.320
people aren't raising the money they thought they would because it's like, oh, I'm making

01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:05.040
all this money and oh shit, now I have to pay taxes.

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:05.520
Oh shit.

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:07.200
I have to pay somebody to manage the money.

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:07.760
Oh shit.

01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:10.560
You know, it's, it's, it's kind of the dark side of Kickstarter, if you will.

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:11.840
Amazing read.

01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:12.640
So check that out.

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:13.520
It's not the dark side.

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:14.880
It's just all these stupid.

01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:16.720
What's the things that people don't think about?

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:18.000
Well, that's your problem.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.680
And see, that's kind of one of the reasons why that your project is not working out in

01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:25.440
the first place because like, Hey, I want to make a game, but you don't think about what's

01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:27.600
involved in actually making a game.

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:30.080
I mean, there is a little bit of the financial end.

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:33.760
You have to have people that manage, you know, your money, your marketing and all that stuff.

01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:36.080
You can't just go make game, make money.

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:38.560
I mean, there's, it's a little bit more complex than that.

01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:40.080
All right.

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:44.080
Just a quick note for the podcast folks.

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:47.520
Apparently our live listeners lost us, but we show we're still connected and uploading

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:48.400
data to the feed.

01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:51.760
So we're going to just keep right on moving.

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:52.000
All right.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:59.280
So anyhow Kickstarter, yes, there is an alternative to Kickstarter called Gambitious.

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:02.560
Now this is how the folks overseas are going to get into this.

01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:07.520
A European indie developers will get this opportunity to use this.

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:09.040
There are some differences.

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:10.240
This is a Dutch company.

01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:14.720
They will be filling the crowdfunding void by using their own service.

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:17.920
You won't be donating funds to receive gifts.

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:21.360
You're actually going to purchase shares of a game's development.

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:23.760
So it's almost like a little mini stock market or something.

01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:27.840
When the game is completed, the user gets dividends like a traditional investor, rather

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:31.280
than a copy of a game or a lunch date or whatever it is that you're doing.

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:33.680
That's kind of cool. It's different.

01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:37.280
It's, it's a very smart way of, it's a, it's a very smart British way of thinking about

01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:37.600
it.

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:38.480
I like it.

01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:39.920
I wish it would do something like that over here.

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:41.440
They were kind of cool.

01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:44.720
Very strange.

01:10:46.080 --> 01:10:46.480
All right.

01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:52.080
So, um, let's move on to a segment we like to do every week here on the show.

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:53.520
I know we're not live.

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:55.920
We still have a big group that listens to us on the podcast.

01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:59.520
And for the record, um, the, they say that the play button's got a slash through it.

01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:01.760
I just went to the site and it looks fine to me.

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:02.000
Yeah.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:02.800
I don't know what's going on.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:04.800
We, we still show we're feeding information.

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:08.640
So, um, I think it's just some type of technical snafu.

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:11.440
It just would not be a live show without technical snafus.

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:13.280
Anyway, let's just get into the classic game of the week.

01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:14.880
We're going to keep moving for the podcast folks.

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:21.920
Dark soccer is going to dive into the gaming vault and find one game that she thinks, Hey,

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:23.680
you ungrateful bitches.

01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:25.600
You should be playing this game right the hell now.

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:30.240
Now, dark soccer, what is the classic game of the week?

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:38.320
The game is Kid Icarus, also known as in Japan as Hikari Shinwa Palutena no Kagami,

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:40.480
which is light mythology Palutena's mirror.

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:46.000
Um, it is, um, an action platform game that came out of the Famicom disc system in Japan

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.160
and cartridge in the U S North America.

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:55.200
Um, and in Europe, it was the very first Kid Icarus game.

01:11:55.200 --> 01:12:01.040
And it came out in Japan in December, 1986 and in Europe and North America in February

01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:04.320
and July, 1987 respectively.

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:11.360
Um, we had a GBA version in 2004, a Wii virtual console version in 2007 and the sequel, um,

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:14.160
that came out on Game Boy in 1991.

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:20.320
And of course the third version that came out on Nintendo 3DS in March, 2012, sorry,

01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:23.440
which having played a little bit of it, loved it, won it.

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:24.160
Oh my God.

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:30.400
So anyway, so basically you are Pit, who is a cute little angel trying to find the three

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:37.520
sacred treasures, which he has to, uh, uh, use to rescue, uh, their goddess of Angel

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:38.480
and Palutena.

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:44.080
Uh, you basically go through different areas where you can scroll up and you've got your

01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:50.480
little, uh, dungeon levels where you have to go on kind of like a grid map type of thing.

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:52.240
Then it's really a neat little game.

01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:56.080
It's, uh, you basically have to reach the end of the levels, defeat the monster that

01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:57.440
guards the three treasures.

01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:02.640
And, um, it actually was done by Nintendo's, uh, research and development one division

01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:09.040
that, uh, meant, uh, it was designed by, um, Toru Asawa and Yoshio Sakamoto and directed

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:10.560
by Satoru Okada.

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:11.840
And you know who produced it?

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:15.280
Gunpei Yokoi, who is the man.

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:22.400
So, um, it actually had kind of mixed reception when it came out.

01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:27.920
There were people that did not like it, but it's, you know, been a classic to everyone

01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:28.400
since.

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:34.480
Um, the, uh, Game Boy version that came out was Kid Icarus of Myths and Monsters in 1991.

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:36.880
And then we had to wait for 20 years.

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:40.720
So now we have, uh, Kid Icarus Uprising and everything's cool.

01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:43.520
But hey, we still have Pit in Super Smash Brothers Brawl.

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:50.560
So basically with this one, like I said, it is a platformer, uh, you go through different

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:56.000
levels and you have, uh, um, you know, you, you collect health, you collect hearts, which

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.840
you can use to buy stuff, and, uh, you also have a score.

01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:05.440
Now, as you go through that, you can go through different, uh, chambers that sometimes they're

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:05.920
a market.

01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:10.480
And, um, sometimes you, uh, have to defeat certain monsters.

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:16.800
You have a god's chamber where, um, your bow and arrow can be, um, increased in strength

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:17.840
by different factors.

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:24.160
And sometimes, uh, it depends on how many enemies you've defeated or how much damage

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:25.040
you've taken in battle.

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:30.240
And then you also have a training chamber where you can get, uh, one of three power

01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:31.920
items if you pass the test.

01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:36.240
So then you have, um, basically you've got the three stages, the underworld, the surface,

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:43.280
and the sky world, and, uh, they have, um, the, the different, uh, levels and the fortress.

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:50.320
And, uh, you know, all the first levels are, um, the underworld and sky stages are basically

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:54.880
ones where you're going bottom to top, and then the last one is a side-scrolling level.

01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.840
The surface world, sorry, it's side-scrolling.

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:04.240
Um, the, uh, fortresses are non-scrolling rooms and you have to find and defeat the

01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:04.880
gatekeeper.

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:10.160
Um, so you can buy a check sheet, a pencil, and a torch so that you can, you know, basically

01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:11.280
track yourself on your map.

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:16.320
And, um, you can get a hammer that destroys statues which will free a flying soldier called

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:18.240
a centurion that will aid you in boss battles.

01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:22.960
And then when each of the bosses are destroyed, you get one of the sacred treasures.

01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:23.680
Blah, blah, blah.

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:30.800
And, um, the last portion, um, are kind of, uh, like a scrolling shooter.

01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:31.680
So it's pretty interesting.

01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:40.080
Um, so, um, the game, like I said, was done by, um, an Nintendo's R&D1 division which,

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:44.480
uh, was actually, the programming was done by an outside company called Intelligent Systems.

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:50.880
It was meant for the, uh, disk system because, um, with the disk card you could, uh, have

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:54.880
three times the storage capacity than the NES cartridges.

01:15:55.680 --> 01:16:00.240
And then, um, it also could save your progress, um, given that it was on a floppy disk.

01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:09.040
Um, of course, when it came out on the, uh, the, uh, Nintendo in the U.S., it was on,

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:14.880
uh, a, uh, cartridge with, uh, a password system.

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:23.360
So, uh, this, a lot went into the creation of this game, actually.

01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:30.480
It was even said that, um, all of the, uh, the pixel art was drawn by, um, Otsawa himself.

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:31.200
That's pretty cool.

01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:42.080
So, um, it was re-released in, um, 19, uh, sorry, in 2004 in Japan as the Famicom mini

01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:44.480
disk system selection for the GBA.

01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:47.120
And, of course, we got it on a virtual console in 2007.

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:52.560
Um, you know, remember the cheat codes, Rob?

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:54.880
I do.

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:58.240
Wasn't there, like, Medusa fights Icarus Angels or vice versa?

01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:02.240
Icarus fights Medusa Angels, and there was Terror, Danger, Horror.

01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:06.160
Yes, they took that out of the 3DS remake, if you can believe it.

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:06.800
Yeah, they did.

01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:08.720
That's what I was leading up to.

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:09.920
No, my bad.

01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:17.440
But, um, there were, uh, when, uh, there was, uh, the eShop version of the download code

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:22.480
that was given to those who registered two 3DS games, um, with Nintendo in Japan and

01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:24.720
Europe, or pre-ordered Kid Icarus uprisings.

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:27.360
So, that was pretty neat.

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:36.000
So, yeah, the game sold 1.76 million copies worldwide by 2003, and definitely, uh, got

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:36.960
a cult following.

01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:44.320
Um, when, uh, there was a magazine in the UK called Nintendo Magazine System that said

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:47.680
it was pretty good fun, but did not compare to other platform games.

01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:49.200
Boo to them.

01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:52.480
And part of it had to do with their rather dated graphics.

01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:58.560
Um, but it was said in Retro Gamer, which is a magazine that Dan and I pick up sometime,

01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:04.640
um, that it was the unsung hero of the NES, looks and sounds pretty, and said that the

01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:09.680
music is sublime and the enemy characters are brilliantly drawn, which I have to agree

01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:11.200
with every single last bit of that.

01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:20.000
Now, um, JeremyParishWithOneUp.com said that it was a fairly forgotten masterpiece and

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:21.760
that it was underwhelming, buggy, and annoying.

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:23.120
You know what?

01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:23.920
I say shut up.

01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:25.600
Agreed.

01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:28.000
It really is.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.680
Now, I will say this, that game is freaking hard as fuck.

01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:33.920
By hard as fuck, you mean fun?

01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:39.280
I mean, it's not that it's not fun, but it's just proof that a game could be challenging

01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:43.360
and still, you know, make you want to keep playing, want to keep doing better.

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:47.760
You know, and keep in mind, you know, we've seen Kid Icarus, oh, sorry, I should say Pit.

01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:52.560
Pit was in Captain N, which that was a horrible show, but it's still part of my childhood.

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:55.600
And, um, we've even seen Pit in Tetris.

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:57.440
Remember when you win on the harder levels?

01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:00.000
He pops up on the little windscreen.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Uh-huh.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:07.840
Um, F1 Race in Super Smash Brothers Melee, and he was a playable character in Super Smash

01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:11.600
Brothers Brawl, and they completely redesigned his appearance for that game.

01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:17.840
Which, you know, that really, when he showed up in Brawl, I think that was the big,

01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:20.080
oh my god, are we gonna get, you know, Pit?

01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:23.040
Are we gonna have another game, you know, another Kid Icarus game?

01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:25.440
Don't you remember all the fuss that that started?

01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:27.840
I do, I do.

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:31.040
And there was all the leaked artwork that had come out before, and all this stuff?

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:31.840
That's right.

01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:36.240
Well, there was, um, they basically, uh, unveiled Kid Icarus Uprising.

01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:37.520
Sorry, I love the dungeon music.

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:42.240
Even though the loop gets annoying as hell after a few minutes, I love the dungeon music.

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:43.200
Okay, sorry.

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:46.400
You know what I liked, what I used to do in this one when you get turned into an eggplant?

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:49.360
Is I would hold down and then slide across the floor as an eggplant.

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:49.760
Yes.

01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:50.800
You couldn't see his little legs.

01:19:51.520 --> 01:19:52.400
Oh, that was the best.

01:19:52.400 --> 01:20:01.040
Um, but basically, um, it, the, uh, they revealed Kid Icarus Uprising in E3 2010 and

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:04.240
suddenly a 3D shooter that was developed by Project Sora.

01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:10.400
And that's the same company that did, uh, Super, uh, that's, uh, sorry, the same company

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:14.400
that the Smush Brothers designer Masahiro Sakurai is from.

01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:20.000
So it kind of does go back to that, you know, that thing.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:25.000
There was, um, an unofficial Flash game that was done by Flip Industries called Super Kid

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:30.800
Icarus that, um, basically was trying to bridge the gap between the upcoming sequel at the

01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:31.760
time and the old one.

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:37.840
And it had a cheat system that could make, uh, to quote, a very tough game, a walk in

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:43.200
the park and, uh, had a reverse difficulty curve.

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:46.000
Basically you can play it 16 bit on your web browser.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:50.320
Um, I don't know what became of that because honestly that's the first I had ever heard

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:52.800
of it, but now I kind of want to find it and play it.

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:54.880
So that's our game, Kid Icarus.

01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:57.840
All right, there it is.

01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:00.320
Your classic game of the week, Kid Icarus on the NES.

01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:03.360
I just think that the, um, the original name is pretty cool though.

01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:04.640
I do.

01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:05.040
I like that.

01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:08.160
Hikari Shinwa, you know, light mythology.

01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:09.840
Uh, all right.

01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:12.400
We don't know what's going on with the live feed.

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:14.000
We're still showing that we're sending data.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:18.480
Apparently the server itself is down, so we don't know what's up.

01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:24.160
Um, we, uh, you know, according to folks in chat, this seems to be like a legit server

01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:26.880
crash that's happening, uh, what have you.

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:27.920
So we don't know what's up.

01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:30.320
Um, we're gonna need to take a little bit of a break here.

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:36.080
Um, so we're going to go ahead and play music anyway, even though the podcasters won't hear

01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:38.960
it, but at least it's chance for us to take a break and figure out how we're going to

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:47.040
broadcast part B and we'll be right back.

01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:49.760
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:55.440
We are live, sorta, on this Sunday evening, April the 22nd of 2012.

01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:58.240
Um, just what's going on for the live folks real quick.

01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:02.960
Um, we flipped it to Ustream, um, which obviously you're figuring this out if you're, you're

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:04.240
connecting to the feed right now.

01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:07.040
And if you see, yep, yes, that video really is live.

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:08.480
That's my little hand waving in front of it.

01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:09.360
But we're shy.

01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:11.040
So you have to look at Mr. Chocobo.

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:14.640
Um, and I don't know what's going on with all games.

01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:17.520
We care, I am still streaming to the all game server.

01:22:17.520 --> 01:22:19.440
I'm streaming the both right now.

01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:22.160
So this is going to be interesting to see if we can have the bandwidth for it.

01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:27.280
But, uh, the all game, the all games server crashed or something happened.

01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:28.560
So we don't know what's up.

01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:32.960
And guys, we suspect it's not, I realized there was a big announcement this week and

01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:38.480
people are, you know, coming up with conspiracy theories, but we think if it was that, which

01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:42.960
would be silly if it was that, um, we wouldn't be able to, we would just have the access

01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:45.760
to, to stream to the feed taken away altogether.

01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.840
Cause they know the IP we broadcast from.

01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:49.120
So, uh, we don't think it's that.

01:22:49.120 --> 01:22:54.880
It's just, um, how ironic, how ironic it's like rain on your wedding day.

01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:56.240
There you go.

01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:57.280
All right.

01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:00.320
So anyway, uh, we're going to get back into the show.

01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:02.640
So for the podcast listeners, you haven't missed it.

01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:07.280
This is the funny thing about being a podcast listener right now is that with everything

01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:11.680
that's going on and all the announcements and all the chat we've had tonight, um, nothing

01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:14.160
is going to, nothing is going to change for the podcast.

01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:17.360
If you're listening to the show right now as a podcaster and you've never listened

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:19.840
live, don't, don't change anything.

01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:23.520
You'll still get next week's show at the same time and all that good stuff.

01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:24.800
So, all right.

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:28.320
Um, anyhow, let's try to move on with the show best we can.

01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:31.600
Uh, we're going to move into some rapid fire news.

01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:35.840
Sorry, I'm, I'm, I guess Dark Soccer's computer just crashed on top of anything, everything

01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:36.320
else.

01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:37.840
Won't anything work?

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:39.200
Why is technology?

01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:40.320
Because this is a piece of shit.

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:41.600
My husband won't buy me an iPad.

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:44.320
Why is technology revolting against us?

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:46.080
It's like the fucking Terminator.

01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:49.280
Okay.

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:51.520
I don't have to reboot, but I do have to reopen all my windows.

01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:52.320
That's all right.

01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:55.120
We're going to get into some rapid fire news here.

01:23:57.840 --> 01:23:58.240
Sorry.

01:23:58.800 --> 01:23:59.920
You everything all right over there?

01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:01.760
Let's move on with some rapid fire news.

01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:04.320
Loki, why don't you start us off?

01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:04.720
All right.

01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:06.640
Well, Vita is getting some free apps.

01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:07.840
I actually downloaded one of them.

01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:10.640
I haven't got a chance to play with the rest yet because I don't think they're up yet,

01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:13.120
but they, um, they're getting three new apps.

01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:14.640
One is called Paint Park.

01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:16.720
Then there's Treasure Park and then Wake Up Club.

01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:22.320
Um, Paint Park is basically a basic paint program.

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:28.000
Um, you can take pictures of crap and draw and share it with your friends and do all

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:28.960
that fun stuff.

01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:32.480
Plus, I believe you can actually draw with friends maybe.

01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:36.560
Um, and you can also use the rear touch pad and the front touch pad and all that fun stuff.

01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:38.480
Um, so that's neat.

01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:42.560
Then later this summer, they're going to be, um, introducing Treasure Park and Wake Up

01:24:42.560 --> 01:24:43.280
Call.

01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:48.800
Um, I guess Treasure Park is an app that lets you create your own puzzles and send them

01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:53.680
out to your friends, um, using Nier and I guess 3G.

01:24:53.680 --> 01:25:00.000
And then also Wake Up Call is an alarm clock app, uh, that syncs with your alarm or syncs

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.880
your alarm with other PlayStation Vita users.

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:06.800
I don't understand why you would want to do that.

01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:11.440
And it says there's also a competitive element where players can set a goal or set goals

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:14.720
and are awarded for meeting or exceeding.

01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:15.520
I don't get it.

01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:16.240
That's stupid.

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:19.760
Set your alarm goal.

01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:21.680
I mean, what's the point of that?

01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:23.120
It doesn't make any sense.

01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:26.240
That is very, turning alarms, alarm clocks into a video game.

01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:26.720
I'm not sure.

01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:30.080
You know, how quickly you answer the alarm.

01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:31.520
I don't understand.

01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:33.200
I could use something like that, actually.

01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:35.680
I'm the type of person that'll hit the damn snooze for an hour.

01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:41.760
So something to motivate me to set four alarms, actually get out of bed, you know, a shiny

01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:44.960
sticker for my alarm clock park or whatever it's called.

01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:46.720
But yeah, Paint Park is available right now.

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:50.320
It is free, so you can check it out and play around with that.

01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:56.240
I actually, I haven't turned my Vita on in a few weeks, so I missed a lot of stuff on

01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:56.400
there.

01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:59.120
I downloaded the Wipeout demo.

01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:02.160
I want to check that out because people keep saying that's a good game to get.

01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:08.720
And then also there is like some AR thing with resistance that you can play with.

01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:13.920
And then there's that other free like puzzle game that they've got where I guess it's limited

01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:15.120
plays per day or something like that.

01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:16.640
Hey, but it's free, so you can try it.

01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:18.080
And if it sucks, you can delete it.

01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:22.560
I still have to, I have an eight gig card, I still have to move everything over too,

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:23.920
but I haven't gotten a chance to do that yet.

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:25.920
So fun, fun.

01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:33.680
Yeah, something else that's kind of cool DLC wise, you know, LittleBigPlanet had a lot

01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:35.280
of cool DLC when it came out.

01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:39.200
And of course they're going to kind of continue on doing it without LittleBigPlanet carting.

01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:46.400
With pre-order, I'm assuming at major retailers, Amazon GameStop they're mentioning, you get

01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:48.240
free Kevin Butler DLC.

01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:50.640
That's right, the fake VP himself.

01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:55.440
You get the Sackboy costume and his golf cart to play as.

01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:58.320
How nice that they can still find a use for that mascot, right?

01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:00.800
He was awesome.

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:01.360
You know what?

01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:04.080
Fucking bring him over to Nintendo.

01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:06.880
That's the kick in the pants that Nintendo needs right there.

01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:11.520
It's a good marketing campaign or we haven't gotten to this yet.

01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:13.120
Oh, I'll save that for later.

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:19.920
Anyways, last but not least, there's a rumor, or I should say a campaign sort of, to bring

01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:25.840
Archer, the FX animated series, to Pinball FX as a table.

01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:33.440
And apparently this is, it came to fruition via some tweets from the Archer production

01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:34.160
designer.

01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:40.400
I guess someone tweeted the Archer production designer and art director and then he's like,

01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:44.560
and then he's like, well, yeah, hey, you know, that sounds like a cool idea.

01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:46.160
You know, Zen Studios wants to do it.

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:50.720
Then I guess we can, you know, send the idea to FX and see if they're game for it.

01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:53.200
And then Zen Studios is like, hell yeah, we'll do it.

01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:58.000
And so, you know, now it's kind of in FX's hands to, you know, whether or not they were

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:02.800
going to put the wheels in motion, I guess, and they're going to swap contact information

01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:05.440
and maybe we'll have an Archer table some day.

01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:07.120
That'd be neat.

01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:08.800
That would actually be all kinds of awesome.

01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:13.280
I so supported this idea, even though if I recall correctly, Pinball FX has a spy table.

01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:14.640
Who cares?

01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:16.640
Archer's like 10 times better than that.

01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:20.800
So, you know, that's all for that is I really wanted to like Archer, but I hate it, but

01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:21.440
I think it's good.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:22.240
Yes.

01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:23.760
Archer's hilarious.

01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:25.760
I hate it, but I hate you.

01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:26.880
But here's the thing though.

01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:29.120
I hated the office when I first watched it too.

01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:32.800
It's one of those things that you got to go back later on and you're like, oh, this is

01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:36.000
funny or like it's always sunny and felt no, actually it's always saying it was always

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
funny, but, um, it looks stupid.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.680
Like it's always sunny, looked terrible.

01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:40.640
And that's true.

01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:43.040
The first time I watched, it's always sunny in Philadelphia.

01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:46.000
I hated it, but now I think it's like one of the most hilarious shows on TV.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:50.720
So it's, I'm willing to go back and try it again, but it's just right now.

01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:52.240
I don't know.

01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:55.760
I don't have time, but I'll eventually go back and watch Archer and hopefully enjoy

01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:55.840
it.

01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:58.480
Um, let me just quickly plug our chat room.

01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:00.240
Chat dot orange on traded.com.

01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:02.640
I don't know if any stragglers are finding us through Ustream.

01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:04.160
This is our backup right now.

01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:06.160
The all game server stopped responding.

01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:07.520
So we're continuing on with the show.

01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:09.520
You can't stop us that easily internet.

01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:12.160
So we're continuing on, uh, chat dot orange launch.com.

01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:15.680
If you want to chat with us, I don't even know if the Ustream TV chat room is there,

01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:17.120
but if it is, we're not looking at it.

01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:21.680
So you need to go to chat dot orange launch radio.com to chat with us, uh, live as we're

01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:24.800
doing our little radio show on this Sunday evening.

01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:28.400
Also, I want to open up the ask orange lounge line.

01:29:28.400 --> 01:29:32.800
Send a private message to sky S K I E in the chat room at chat dot orange lounge,

01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:38.000
city.com if you have a question for ask orange lounge, and we're going to get to that shortly

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.880
after a few more stories quickly.

01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:45.120
This is really sad and this is something I think it happened on the week we were off,

01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:48.160
but you know, we need to say it and tip our hat to this.

01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:53.760
Um, Jack Tramiel, uh, he founded the company that created the Commodore 64.

01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:57.600
He died at the age of 83, um, according to Forbes magazine.

01:29:57.600 --> 01:30:02.720
And you know, if you grew up on the Commodore family of computers like I did, um, then Jack

01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:05.680
Tramiel was obviously somebody important to you.

01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:07.200
So rest in peace.

01:30:07.840 --> 01:30:11.600
Um, going to a completely different topic here on Nintendo.

01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:14.640
Uh, real quick, I'm sorry.

01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:20.720
I don't, I didn't have a 64, but, uh, wasn't it like the command to like start a program

01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:26.560
or something like 80 something or load quote star quote comma eight comma one.

01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:28.400
Uh, that would've been ironic if it was four.

01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:29.680
You know what?

01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:35.200
There were, um, that was actually the same, uh, command on the Apple two E wasn't no Apple

01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:36.480
for some of the games that I played.

01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:39.040
It was, I thought Apple did something different.

01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:42.000
It was like you do, it was similar, but it wasn't a star.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.800
The star was unique to Commodore and the comma eight comma one.

01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:47.280
Cause comma eight is what called out the disk drive.

01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:50.000
And I think if you had a tape drive, it was comma seven.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:54.640
Like I think I remember doing the comma eight comma one on the, um, Apple.

01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:56.480
Are you sure you weren't playing a comma for load runner?

01:30:58.320 --> 01:30:58.640
All right.

01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:01.680
Well, the load runner was multi-platform, but anyway, let's move on.

01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:04.800
I'm talking about Miyamoto being a damn tease.

01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:09.680
Miyamoto had a conversation with the edge at edge online.com.

01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:13.040
And, uh, yeah, he was talking about, you know, some first party stuff.

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:17.280
Cause that's what we really want to see Nintendo do, especially, you know, after the 3DS didn't

01:31:17.280 --> 01:31:21.600
have a lot going for it, uh, when it first launched, you know, a lot of people were talking

01:31:21.600 --> 01:31:23.280
about what titles they would like to see on it now.

01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:26.880
And now, especially with the Wii U and we talked about some of this earlier.

01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:29.040
Well, Miyamoto is kind of in on this too.

01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:35.040
He said, quote, I think I'd be even more interested in creating something new, maybe based on,

01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:37.600
or starting from a link to the past.

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:39.920
I think it's important to bring some really new software.

01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:46.720
Now, you know, this has led to rampant speculation and internet wank about the whole thing, but

01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:52.160
I mean, I, I love the idea of a new link to the past, but hold on.

01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:56.960
Wasn't Zelda four swords on the GameCube kind of a redo of the link to the past.

01:31:56.960 --> 01:32:01.040
It's not like that idea hasn't been touched since the Super Nintendo days.

01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:01.600
That's not true.

01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:05.040
The Game Boy Advance games and the portable games were really like that until it went

01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:05.840
on Wind Waker.

01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:07.280
I do have to make a rebuttal real quick.

01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:09.520
I was thinking of my cousin's Commodore 64.

01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:11.040
Ah, okay.

01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:11.440
Sorry.

01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:12.000
That's all right.

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:18.880
Um, it would mean to me, I think he's looking at kind of like, um, doing the new Super Mario

01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:23.200
approach to it where basically they kind of do an updated engine, but the kind of old

01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:24.480
school play style.

01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:28.320
So you would have like an updated engine, maybe a top down Zelda game, kind of like

01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:32.640
it was, but my God, put an editor in there, put a community feature where people can create

01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:35.440
their own, like, you know, quests and stuff like that.

01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:39.600
You're talking like money in the bank right there.

01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:44.880
I mean, it would be epic and it would be really something that Nintendo would kind of say,

01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:49.200
kind of say, Hey, look, we understand the internet and community features and stuff

01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:49.440
like that.

01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:54.960
Instead of pretending that you do or say, Hey, now we can do updates, you know, for

01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:55.920
games are buggy.

01:32:56.480 --> 01:32:57.360
We're with it.

01:32:57.360 --> 01:32:58.000
We're cool.

01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:05.920
Now this is the other big part of this is that he was asked about F zero.

01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:07.200
So excited.

01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:11.760
And he did say this quote, maybe with future hardware with Wii U coming up, maybe we could

01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:16.480
create something that does make sense either as a smaller game or a fully fledged title.

01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:18.480
Yes, please.

01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:23.040
But that's an interesting way for him to phrase it either as a smaller game.

01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:27.360
Could this be talking about like a Wii U where type of game?

01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:28.960
Is that what we're talking about?

01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:30.480
Or a small as in portable?

01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:35.040
There's a lot you can read into that and probably way more than Miyamoto intended anybody, but

01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:37.040
you will not calm the fanboy wank down.

01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:38.960
Riddle me this.

01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:43.840
Yes, so I'm assuming that this little tablet controller thing that they're going to put

01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:47.280
out is probably going to have some sort of ARM processor in there, something that can,

01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:50.080
you know, obviously render some video and that kind of stuff.

01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:53.440
Well, a lot of these tablet devices are based off of certain ARM processors.

01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:56.880
Could you, for example, and there were some other patents, which I don't know if we have

01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:03.040
a story on, but whatever, um, you know, could you, for example, imagine that, Hey, guess

01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:03.280
what?

01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:07.600
Just like, you know, the pocket station or even like the Vita or something like that,

01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:12.480
you know, Hey, you can take a version of your gaming experience on the road with you.

01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:17.280
So for example, like, Hey, uh, we're going to create like a virtual console app that

01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:18.320
runs on this tablet.

01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:18.800
And guess what?

01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:19.200
You know what?

01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:24.960
Not only does a tablet screaming or stream your gameplay from the TV, but you can take

01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:26.720
that tablet with you and play on the road.

01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:30.080
These like games.

01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:33.760
Well, but there's the whole like streaming.

01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:36.160
Well, it doesn't have to stream the content.

01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:39.040
I'm saying that the processor would be able to render its own content.

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:44.800
Um, and yes, you could do this also with the 3DS where you would have just a virtual console

01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:47.440
game or, you know, 3DS app or something like that.

01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:52.560
But it would be kind of a neat way to get people interested because, well, then again,

01:34:52.560 --> 01:34:59.040
they would also kind of cut themselves in the knee by, um, you know, basically offering

01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:02.960
a portable system with a console system, but it might get people to buy the system.

01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:04.400
Very true.

01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:08.880
Uh, one more story for you guys before I turn it over to Dark Sakura, and that is for you

01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:09.840
Bimani fans.

01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:10.800
Where are you at?

01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:11.200
Holla!

01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:18.480
BeatMania 2DX 20, or as I like to call it 20th style, even though that pisses the hardcore

01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:23.920
off because this is really called BeatMania 2DX 20 Tricoro is the name of the game.

01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:26.240
Konami has confirmed it exists.

01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:27.040
It exists.

01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:28.160
It's called Tricoro.

01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:33.120
The three color scheme is kind of what they're going with with the whole red, yellow, blue

01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:37.840
and, uh, location testing is underway April 19th through the 24th in Japan.

01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:40.640
Happy birthday to me in Japan.

01:35:41.440 --> 01:35:41.680
Right.

01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:43.840
Um, I'm going to be honest.

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:49.280
I haven't followed the BeatMania 2DX series since about what style was like DJ Troopers

01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:50.240
probably even before that.

01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:52.640
Happy Sky, 12, 13.

01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:52.880
Yeah.

01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:55.280
I think the last one I actually touched was an Empress.

01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:56.640
Oh, wow.

01:35:56.640 --> 01:35:58.240
I didn't even play an Empress ever.

01:35:58.240 --> 01:35:59.120
Like, oh, but they did.

01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:00.320
They did have the PS2.

01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:02.960
I keep forgetting they cranked out those PS2 games right up.

01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:04.160
Empress was the last one.

01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:04.480
Yeah.

01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:05.360
I keep forgetting that.

01:36:06.080 --> 01:36:07.760
So, well, there you go.

01:36:07.760 --> 01:36:14.880
Anyway, 2DX 20th is happening and it's location testing right now, but Mani's not dead in

01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:15.380
Japan.

01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:18.240
Well, uh, there's a few other things.

01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:23.040
How about some new Kinect games that are, uh, for kids that actually, I kind of want

01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:24.240
to get one of these.

01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:26.240
It's Kinect Sesame Street TV.

01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:30.080
It's got Cookie Monster and Groover.

01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:31.840
There's no Elmo to be seen.

01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:32.980
Yay.

01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:36.400
But that's going to launch, um, autumn 2012.

01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:40.480
That's according to the Arganon CEO, James Bustal.

01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:45.920
And then there is a Kinect National Geographic, like Nat Geo TV, it says.

01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:48.800
And that's being put out by C21 Media.

01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:50.160
That's pretty cool.

01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:52.560
I would get the Sesame Street one.

01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:53.120
Just saying.

01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:59.840
And then there is a leaked trailer that if it's to be believed, then Resident Evil 6

01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:01.280
will come out on October 2nd.

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.560
I'm sure there's a few people who are still into that series.

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:06.820
A few.

01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:10.000
Well, Resident Evil 6 looks, you know, hot.

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:13.680
A lot of people are very excited about it, but according to not a side story, which is

01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:14.480
a good thing.

01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:20.000
According to this trailer, the protagonist is, uh, Wesker's son, the man who's told

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:20.800
to save the world.

01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:27.520
And then last but not least, Brink has sold more than 2.5 million copies worldwide.

01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:29.360
That's pretty cool.

01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:32.000
Good job, Brink.

01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:33.600
Yay, Brink.

01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:34.800
All right.

01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:38.160
Well, honestly, that's a lot better than I thought that game did, because I thought that

01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:39.360
game tanked.

01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:39.680
Yeah.

01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:42.880
But that warrants a sequel, I would say.

01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:44.160
I mean, that's very true.

01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:46.560
I hope they're smart enough not to do one.

01:37:48.240 --> 01:37:48.560
All right.

01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:53.120
Well, since tonight was supposed to be a kind of a special show at All Games Radio, although

01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:55.760
the server issues are holding us back, we're still going on YouTube.

01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:57.040
It's a different type of special now.

01:37:57.040 --> 01:37:58.480
It's a different type of special.

01:37:58.480 --> 01:37:59.440
It's Fupa now.

01:37:59.440 --> 01:37:59.920
That's right.

01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:00.720
Fupa Fupa.

01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:06.160
So we thought we would do, instead of the Fugal Question of the Week, we would do Ask

01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:07.200
Orange Lounge tonight.

01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:09.760
We don't do this segment very often, but it's when we open it up.

01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:12.080
It is the show where every gamer has a voice.

01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:15.920
You want to ask us anything, especially, you know, with what's going on tonight.

01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:17.840
You can send a private message.

01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:19.680
You want to ask us about life or anything.

01:38:21.680 --> 01:38:22.000
All right.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.160
You can send that over private message to Sky.

01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:30.160
So let's cue up the music.

01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:33.600
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:36.880
Well, will we find out tonight on Orange Lounge Radio?

01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:41.680
One thing I'd like to know is why can't we stream on All Games anymore?

01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:45.120
It was supposed to be a special show, but leave it to us to get fucked.

01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:45.440
All right.

01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:50.640
First question tonight.

01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:53.680
Loco Poco.

01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:54.320
I love that name.

01:38:55.040 --> 01:38:56.960
Reminds me of like Poco Roco.

01:38:56.960 --> 01:39:00.320
Loco Poco wants to know if RuPaul's Drag Race was a fighting game.

01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:01.760
Thank God for serious questions.

01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:03.680
Thank God for serious questions.

01:39:04.320 --> 01:39:09.520
If RuPaul's Drag Race was a fighting game, how bad would RuPaul be as a final boss if

01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:11.440
he had SNK boss syndrome?

01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:13.840
Well, you know, it's funny.

01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:16.880
I don't know if you've seen the video for Glamazon, but it's on the internet.

01:39:16.880 --> 01:39:19.680
You know, the big video that features the three finalists.

01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:21.920
It has like a video game theme.

01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:22.480
Funny enough.

01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:27.200
And it's, you know, the three queens that beat all the other ones, like being big Glamazon

01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:28.000
robot stepping up.

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.400
But there's a lot of like video game graphics in it and stuff.

01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:33.680
So it was clearly inspired by games.

01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:34.800
You want to know something funny?

01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:44.080
Like in the early 90s, my friend had an avatar online called Glamazon who was a large buxom

01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:46.720
overweight Wonder Woman.

01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:51.120
So, um, how bad would RuPaul be as a final boss?

01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:56.000
Um, I, you would sashay all over your face.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:02.880
Uh, but seriously, what would a dream fighting game crossover that has yet to be done be

01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:05.360
a dream fighting game crossover that hasn't happened yet?

01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:12.480
I don't know about fighting game, but I do know what I would like as a, uh, um, survival

01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:13.280
horror game.

01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:14.320
I'd like a supernatural game.

01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:17.440
I just want a new goddamn killer instinct game.

01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:18.400
Is that too much to ask?

01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:21.280
We'll say killer instinct versus mortal combat.

01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:22.560
That's that works in my head.

01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:23.760
That would be pretty epic.

01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:25.360
I'm going to say that for my answer.

01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:31.920
I want, um, pretty fighter versus Oscar 120% who only say go Saturn fighting game.

01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:32.960
People know what I'm talking about.

01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:37.120
Tiger claw thinks RuPaul's drag race would be more of a cart racing game.

01:40:37.680 --> 01:40:41.200
Gio video says RuPaul would be a fierce final boss, fierce, fierce.

01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:44.400
All right, moving on to a question from act deft.

01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:46.960
Here we go with a serious question, guys.

01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:47.680
All right.

01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:54.240
What's the thing or are the things you have regretted doing in the show and why anything

01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:57.040
you think or know you did wrong or shouldn't have done at all.

01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:01.040
Regrets a strong word.

01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:02.560
Oh, I think I know what Loki says.

01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:03.120
Go ahead.

01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:03.840
Karaoke.

01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:10.320
Um, I'm sure there's things I've said.

01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:13.760
In fact, I know there's things I've said where I've kind of gone back and changed my mind

01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:14.240
later on.

01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:18.080
And I think, boy, I sounded kind of stupid and ignorant saying that, um, my opinion on

01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:22.000
some games ends up changing, but you know, that's part of this process.

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:25.040
And that's kind of the risk that we take doing this show every week.

01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:30.080
And having done it for so long is that, you know, sometimes we're going to grow up in

01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:30.880
front of you.

01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:32.880
And in a lot of ways that's kind of happened.

01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:37.280
You know, when we started this show, we were 10 years younger than we are now.

01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:39.920
We went from being in our early twenties to being our early thirties.

01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:42.160
And I think there's just a lot of like kind of growing up that happens.

01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:47.280
I'm going to be honest, although I think are the old shows for OLR are great.

01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:50.480
And I'm really proud of a lot that we accomplished in the old shows.

01:41:50.480 --> 01:41:55.120
When I go back and listen to old episodes, like anything before episode like 150, really,

01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:56.400
I go back and listen to the old stuff.

01:41:56.400 --> 01:42:00.640
It's really hard for me to listen to because I'm like, Oh God, Oh God, there's so much

01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:01.840
technically wrong with this.

01:42:01.840 --> 01:42:04.960
And it just sounds like a hot fucking mess everywhere.

01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:09.920
So, I mean, I wouldn't call that a regret, but it's definitely something we've really

01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:11.760
like learned a lot from.

01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:18.080
So, I mean, otherwise, as far as specific instances, I can't, maybe when I had my diva

01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:19.920
fit, I'm not really proud of that moment.

01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:25.200
That was, you know, back when the show, ironically, when the show died halfway through and, uh,

01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:27.600
something just set me off and I think it was on Justin TV.

01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:29.760
I don't know the place where we used to stream.

01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:30.400
So I don't know.

01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:38.000
Um, that, that wasn't a highlight of my career, certainly, but regret regrets a strong word

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:40.960
because you learn from every little fuck up, you know?

01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:43.040
All right.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:50.160
Rama asks, what game you played was so bad, you said, fuck this shit, drop the controller

01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:50.640
and left.

01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:54.000
What game was so bad?

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.720
You said, fuck this shit, drop the controller and left.

01:42:56.720 --> 01:42:57.760
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:42:57.760 --> 01:42:58.800
You didn't, you weren't jumping in.

01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:02.400
I assumed you, you, what do you, what would you like to say for regrets?

01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:02.800
Nothing.

01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:05.920
Bitch.

01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:06.420
All right.

01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:09.120
I haven't rod rolled you enough.

01:43:10.240 --> 01:43:13.520
Uh, game where you drop the controller and said, fuck this shit.

01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:15.840
Fusion, Fusion Frenzy 2.

01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:17.600
So fucking terrible.

01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:18.080
That game.

01:43:18.080 --> 01:43:20.640
I was like, what the hell is this garbage that I'm playing?

01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:21.920
Yaris would be a good one.

01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:25.040
Sonic 4 episode 1.

01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:25.920
Sorry to say.

01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:28.000
Loki.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:28.800
Bullet Witch.

01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:30.560
Oh yeah.

01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:32.720
Oh yeah.

01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:36.400
And actually Oni Chumbara because it was pretty annoying.

01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:42.000
The whole having to have your sword get dirty and it gets stuck in zombies is stupid.

01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:43.920
A sword would not get stuck in zombies.

01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:45.600
A sword chops zombies in half.

01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:50.800
Um, let's see, going to, I'm going to try to burn through the rest of these questions

01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:51.520
here pretty quick.

01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:56.880
Randy says, have you guys ever looked through your game collections only to find a sealed

01:43:56.880 --> 01:43:57.280
game?

01:43:57.280 --> 01:43:57.840
Oh God.

01:43:57.840 --> 01:43:58.560
All the time.

01:43:58.560 --> 01:43:59.200
All the time.

01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:03.680
This happened to my cousin and a shrink trap copy of NBA 2K10 yesterday.

01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:05.360
All right, Randy.

01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:10.720
No, I found the Blue Seed RPG about a month ago for Saturn.

01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:13.360
I have a copy right over there.

01:44:13.360 --> 01:44:16.640
Pilot wings resort on the 3DS still sitting in the shrink trap.

01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:18.960
Stupid me.

01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:21.440
Might as well sell that stuff for new on eBay.

01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:21.760
Right.

01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:25.440
Matt, anything that you've had?

01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:31.520
Um, I just have, I have copies, but I'm nothing that I didn't know I have because I normally

01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:33.520
don't leave that stuff, you know, shrunk.

01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:39.840
Um, I have still a shrunk copy of, um, Earth Defense Force, the original one, because I

01:44:39.840 --> 01:44:41.920
bought five copies of it.

01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:45.520
Well, actually I bought three copies when we were selling them at my work for five bucks

01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:46.080
each.

01:44:46.080 --> 01:44:47.440
I'm like, I can't pass it up.

01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:49.440
I am buying all the copies of those games.

01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:50.800
So I kept them.

01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:56.480
And funny enough, I actually, uh, I broke a couple copies of mine and, um, it's still

01:44:56.480 --> 01:45:00.480
worth actually pretty, you know, a pretty good amount of money, I think, because it's

01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:01.600
hard to find now.

01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:01.840
All right.

01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:02.400
I'm going to close.

01:45:02.400 --> 01:45:06.640
Which, by the way, Sandbox Games is working on a new version of Earth Defense Force and

01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:07.040
I'm very excited.

01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:09.040
Actually, Rob, there is another game that we have that's still shrink wrapped.

01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:09.680
What's that?

01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:15.440
That's, um, uh, Gunstar Heroes for the, uh, Game Gear.

01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:16.000
Serious.

01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:17.760
Why, why when you got the Genesis one?

01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:18.080
All right.

01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:19.520
Well, I bought it for Dan as a treat.

01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:22.480
I'm going to end no more questions because I got five questions in queue.

01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:24.160
So question time is up.

01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:25.520
I'm going to get to read my question.

01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:26.240
These five questions.

01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:27.200
I'm not reading your question.

01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:28.000
My question is great.

01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:31.040
Dark Sakura asks, why you so fly?

01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:33.200
Because I'm hot.

01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:33.440
All right.

01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:34.240
Moving on.

01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:39.760
Uh, GZDR4EV wants to know, according to Wiki is a deep question.

01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:44.880
According to Wiki, 68% of the population believes in some type of religion.

01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:49.120
So why aren't there more video games with a religious theme?

01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:51.040
Controversy.

01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:52.000
Hi people.

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:55.520
You get one little thing about someone's religion wrong and they want to just go,

01:45:55.520 --> 01:45:57.760
eh, sacrilegious, bleh.

01:45:57.760 --> 01:45:59.120
I, I think it is part that.

01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:03.680
I mean, even though the stat is 68% believe, the problem is that split up into how many

01:46:03.680 --> 01:46:05.280
different types of religions.

01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:08.560
So, you know, and like Dark Sakura says, you get something wrong.

01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:14.560
I don't think, you know, I, you may not kind of put the two in the same category, but I

01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:20.480
think there's a lot of games where spirituality is a theme, especially a lot of modern RPGs.

01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:25.200
I think especially a lot of the newer final fantasy games, uh, Mass Effect to some extent

01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:26.720
has a little bit of those themes in it.

01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:32.240
I mean, it's not really in your face, but there definitely is questions about, you know,

01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:34.400
the big picture, which is what religion's about.

01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:38.320
All these different, um, especially in RPGs, like you were saying, all these different

01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:40.480
worlds have their own mythologies.

01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:45.520
You know, like, for example, I'm just, uh, you know, I'm going to use World of Warcraft.

01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:48.400
D.R. Foy have thought about, forgot about Battle of Olympus.

01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:53.040
Yeah, no, but, um, I'm just gonna use World of Warcraft as an example, just because it's

01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:53.600
fresh my mind.

01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:55.040
I just finished that thrall book today.

01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:55.600
It was really good.

01:46:56.240 --> 01:47:02.320
It's got elements of shamanism, which, you know, we have in pagan religions today.

01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:06.640
They have their light, which I'm assuming is the way they've lined it up as close to

01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:11.280
an equivalent as Christianity and Judeo-Christian religions.

01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:18.640
You know, they've got, uh, you know, the devil worshipers, they have all kinds of different

01:47:18.640 --> 01:47:23.520
cults, you know, but, you know, even apocalyptic cults, which we've got apocalyptic cults here,

01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:27.120
you know, how many of those people poisoned themselves to get on the giant spaceship on

01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:28.640
Halley's Comet, you know, whatever.

01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:30.880
Oh yeah, no, no, that wasn't, it was Hale-bop.

01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:32.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:32.880
That whole thing.

01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:34.320
The freaky guy on the TV.

01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:34.560
Yeah.

01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:37.200
I blame Um-bop for that.

01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:42.640
But I mean, my point is just using that, I mean, clearly a lot of the religions in that

01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:45.600
game are parallels for types of religions.

01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:53.200
You have those archetypes, you know, um, and then you've got like, say, uh, Final Fantasy

01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:54.240
7, here's an example.

01:47:54.800 --> 01:48:02.240
You've got, um, the Cetra and their earth religion, you know, the, the soul of the planet,

01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:04.640
that type of thing.

01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:06.000
So that's just an example.

01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:07.280
Yeah.

01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:13.360
It's, it's not so much that they're mimicking real religions, it's so much that they've

01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:18.160
created their own mythology based off of what each culture that's made this game understands

01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:18.960
of other religions.

01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:23.760
I mean, the same goes into, you know, different anime TV shows, you name it.

01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:25.840
Wyland has an interesting point.

01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:27.520
Tekken has an angel and a devil in it.

01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:30.960
Well, that's also supposed to be genetic too.

01:48:30.960 --> 01:48:34.240
Xenocore says half the Final Fantasies have that theme, almost anything from Japan.

01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:34.480
Yeah.

01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:36.160
Like the whole, you know, spirituality.

01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:40.800
And here's another idea for anyone who was an old Saturn gamer, you know, like me, there

01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:44.480
was Black Matrix that was based off of hell mythology.

01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:46.420
So.

01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:48.160
All right.

01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:52.160
Um, SSJ100, good answer by the way, but you know, got to move on.

01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:53.040
Four questions left.

01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:57.360
SSJ100 Matt says, if you had the money to buy three arcade machines for yourself, what

01:48:57.360 --> 01:48:58.160
would they be?

01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:02.000
I thought this question came up last week, but it was the show that Jason and Alan were

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:02.160
on.

01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:03.520
So let's hear it from you guys.

01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:05.600
What three arcade machines would you buy?

01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:10.560
For me, Burger Time, Magic Sword, Spy Hunter.

01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:17.760
For me, an Ultracade, a Mame, and now Cheater.

01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:27.440
No, um, I, since I'm going to lump pinball into arcade, um, I'm going to say that I would

01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:32.480
get, um, probably a Tekken 5, just because I really liked that game.

01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:40.160
Um, I would get a Strider and then I would probably get a, um, maybe a Theater of Magic

01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:41.840
pinball or Black Rose.

01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:43.920
You're cheating with the pinball.

01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:44.400
Loki.

01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:45.520
Okay, well then fine.

01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:48.240
I will get, I will get a disc of Tron.

01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:49.760
You do what you want.

01:49:49.760 --> 01:49:53.040
I'll just build an Ultracade or pin Mame or something.

01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:56.560
Uh, let's see.

01:49:56.560 --> 01:50:00.000
Well, this is easy because, you know, I already have an arcade machine at home.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:09.200
So, um, the three that I can't get right now, we'll do, uh, see, uh, fourth mix plus a, uh,

01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:15.200
Max 2 and, uh, whatever the newest, uh, DDR game they have out there to, uh, was it, uh,

01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:19.120
something versus, uh, Dance Dance Revolution second mix or something?

01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:19.840
One of those.

01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:21.200
So three DDR machines.

01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:22.960
If you want three DDR machines.

01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:23.840
Well, they're all different.

01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:26.560
I mean, you know, Max 2 is pretty awesome in its own right.

01:50:26.560 --> 01:50:31.840
And, you know, uh, uh, fourth mix plus is pretty awesome.

01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:36.240
And the new game, I haven't played the new DDR game, but that might be pretty cool.

01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:39.120
Hey Tigercall, the ferret is actually at my house.

01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:41.920
X3 versus second mix says the chat room.

01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:42.240
Yes.

01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:43.760
X3 versus second mix.

01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:44.800
That's what I'll be getting.

01:50:44.800 --> 01:50:46.160
Three questions left.

01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:51.600
Legend of Zaku says looking back, if Konami quickly and directly followed up with a successor

01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:57.680
to DDR extreme 10 years ago, instead of Supernova, do you think it would have created a different

01:50:57.680 --> 01:51:02.160
rhythm game community than what it turned out due to ITG taking that place?

01:51:03.520 --> 01:51:04.480
That's a community.

01:51:04.480 --> 01:51:05.760
That's a loaded question.

01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:08.640
I don't think ITG ever truly took its place.

01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:14.240
ITG caused controversy and kind of splintered the community into a couple, into a couple

01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:16.320
kind of different sex, if you will.

01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:22.400
There was, I said sex, um, there was the pro ITG crowd and the anti-ITG crowd, the DDR

01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:22.720
loyalists.

01:51:22.720 --> 01:51:26.720
This is how I feel about, about it in regards to the ITG thing.

01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:30.960
It's like if you were at a restaurant and then a dog took a shit on the sidewalk, would

01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:33.680
that make a decision about which game, which place you would go to eat?

01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:38.400
Um, I think what needed to happen is yes, Konami needed to put something out a lot sooner

01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:38.880
than they did.

01:51:38.880 --> 01:51:44.400
Konami failed because Konami of Japan refused to take risks.

01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:48.240
Jason Enos forced them to take a risk here in America.

01:51:48.240 --> 01:51:49.920
Basically, I shouldn't say forced, but you know what I mean?

01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:54.240
He pestered and pestered and did the professional version of that for years and years until

01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:56.400
Konami finally released something over here.

01:51:56.400 --> 01:52:01.520
When he left Konami and they shut down Konami Hawaii, who was doing a great job with the

01:52:01.520 --> 01:52:02.560
Xbox games.

01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:07.040
When they shut down Konami in the Bay Area where the fans were making steps and you know,

01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:07.600
all that stuff.

01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:11.040
I think it lost a lot too much to recover from.

01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:16.480
So honestly, a little weird now seeing like some of these step mania, uh, artists and

01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:20.560
stuff like that or people that would make music for step mania and DWI and stuff like

01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:20.800
that.

01:52:21.680 --> 01:52:25.360
Actually as artists in the game, it's a little odd.

01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:26.560
All right.

01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:27.760
Neat, but a little odd.

01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:28.720
Two questions left.

01:52:28.720 --> 01:52:32.720
I do have to give another shout out here because I noticed our Ustream count is increasing.

01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:34.560
This is not a usual thing for us.

01:52:34.560 --> 01:52:36.000
Uh, we are using this as a backup.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:40.320
Our main feed at All Games Radio, which ironically it was to be our last night on All Games Radio.

01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:42.080
It died partway through.

01:52:42.080 --> 01:52:45.120
I am still showing feeding to All Games Radio.

01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:47.040
So their server's down or something.

01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:49.920
But anyhow, that's beside the point.

01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:51.520
You can't shut us up that easy.

01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:52.880
So here we are in Ustream.

01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:55.920
If you want to join us in the chat room, chat.orangelaunchradio.com.

01:52:55.920 --> 01:52:56.880
It's a radio show.

01:52:56.880 --> 01:52:59.200
That's why you're looking at my Tron figurine on the camera.

01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:00.320
All right.

01:53:01.360 --> 01:53:01.840
Moving on.

01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:02.880
Two questions remain.

01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:10.800
Xenocore, what game have you resisted playing the most but been the most pleasantly surprised by?

01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:15.280
Xenocore, you couldn't have given me an easier question because it's going on right now.

01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:16.320
Mass Effect.

01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:19.200
I wrote it off originally as, oh, this isn't my type of game.

01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:20.960
This is like a first person shooter.

01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:25.360
I watched a friend play it and I saw the most boring parts of the game driving the Mako around.

01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:27.200
And I was like, eh, not the game for me.

01:53:27.840 --> 01:53:31.120
Finally, Shane basically threatened to kill me if I didn't play it.

01:53:31.120 --> 01:53:33.600
I'm like, fine, you know, he's very good at bullying me.

01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:34.640
So I said, fine, I'll play.

01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:36.960
Oh, Rob, you should play Mass Effect.

01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:37.840
Pretty much.

01:53:37.840 --> 01:53:38.560
Just like that too.

01:53:38.560 --> 01:53:39.680
That's my Shane impression.

01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:44.160
I didn't know because he'll do that and tell you to do something.

01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:46.880
But then when he fights with you, when he fights with you.

01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:47.360
No, right.

01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:49.360
You got to play the middle.

01:53:49.360 --> 01:53:50.960
He'll totally do the little boy thing.

01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:52.560
I see this fine.

01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:54.240
I don't care if you play it or not.

01:53:54.240 --> 01:53:54.640
Stare.

01:53:54.640 --> 01:54:02.480
So regardless of, you know, the catalyst Mass Effect, I started playing and I absolutely love it.

01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:04.400
And I think it's a fantastic series.

01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:05.680
Jamie, anything for you here?

01:54:05.680 --> 01:54:06.240
Cave Story.

01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:08.080
Oh, that's true.

01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:09.200
It was out for years and years.

01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:12.240
And we just kind of go, oh, well, I had known about Cave Story like forever.

01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:16.720
And I even actually played some of the old version of it when it was, you know,

01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:18.320
like a flash download or something.

01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:23.120
Or I played different incarnations of Cave Story.

01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:24.720
And then just starting to play it again.

01:54:24.720 --> 01:54:27.360
And Dan though, he was really into it.

01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:29.520
So he's like, I'm going to play your Cave Story when you're not here.

01:54:30.080 --> 01:54:31.040
Fine, play it.

01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:31.760
I'll get the point.

01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:33.600
Loki, anything you can think of?

01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:35.200
A series you wrote off originally?

01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:37.440
Uh, Call of Duty Modern Warfare.

01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:37.760
Knew it.

01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:40.960
Honestly, because I played it once.

01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:44.800
I was like, eh, I don't really like this as much as I like the World War II ones.

01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:47.360
I'm not going to really play this.

01:54:47.360 --> 01:54:49.280
And then went back and it was awesome.

01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:54.800
So, you know, gung ho into that, um, I don't know.

01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:58.320
Um, yeah, that's pretty much it, I guess.

01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:00.000
All right.

01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:01.840
Last question from Derek H.

01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:03.200
Question.

01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:09.040
When women say the good ones are always taken, does that mean if you're still single,

01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:09.920
you're not a good one?

01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:14.560
I always heard the good ones are always gay.

01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:15.840
That's what I always heard.

01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:18.640
And I'm always like, that's right.

01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:21.360
No, I was never really in that opinion.

01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:24.320
You know, because I was like, fuck, I don't want anybody.

01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:27.360
And then I met Dan and I was like, well, fine, I guess you'll do.

01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:30.480
No, my husband is the best.

01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:31.920
Have you ever caught yourself saying that?

01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:33.360
I mean, you're the one on this show.

01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:37.200
No, honestly, I haven't because I mean, I've never had a trouble getting a date.

01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:41.440
I don't know why I guess, you know, cause I've always,

01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:46.480
I mean, I always thought that I was kind of this undateable geek chick, you know,

01:55:46.480 --> 01:55:52.400
but I've never really had a problem getting, you know, getting anyone to date me, I guess.

01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:52.800
Yeah.

01:55:52.800 --> 01:55:53.600
But what?

01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:55.920
Can't, nevermind.

01:55:55.920 --> 01:55:57.600
But I mean, but you know.

01:55:57.600 --> 01:55:58.960
Can't say anything appropriate to that.

01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:03.040
No, well, I'm going to go ahead and say this.

01:56:03.760 --> 01:56:05.760
Out loud and public, Dan was my first and only.

01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:10.000
Just saying, you know, not that I haven't made out with a bunch of people, but still.

01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:16.240
But, you know, Dan happened to be the right person at the right time.

01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:17.760
And he's always been the right person.

01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:22.320
So I've never, it's never been a case of why are all the good ones taken?

01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:25.040
It's been, why do all these guys suck?

01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:27.120
And Oh, someone who doesn't suck.

01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:30.000
So that's what my experience is.

01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:33.200
I think, I don't, I don't know if you find this to be the case or not,

01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:36.480
but I think a lot of times when somebody finds the one,

01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:39.920
you're kind of surprised a little bit at it.

01:56:39.920 --> 01:56:44.160
Like, you know, I never thought it would be this or whatever.

01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:46.720
And I think a lot of times women or anybody, I mean,

01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:48.240
I've heard gay guys to say that too.

01:56:48.240 --> 01:56:49.600
I mean, it's not just women that say it.

01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:52.080
I've heard a lot of people say that, that the good ones are always taken.

01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:58.080
And I think, you know, it just means that my radar isn't pinging off because I'm very

01:56:58.080 --> 01:56:59.520
tunnel vision of what I'm looking for.

01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:03.520
And I have written all over my notepad, you know, what I want my dream boy to be like

01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:05.680
and everything that's shoved at me in the media and da da da.

01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:06.800
I'm very tunnel vision.

01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:08.000
And then it's like, Oh shit.

01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:11.680
I just fucking fell in love, you know?

01:57:11.680 --> 01:57:16.480
And even, you know, even though I'm, it's not a woman man situation, you know,

01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:20.480
Alan, I knew for years online, never would have thought I'd end up with him,

01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:21.680
moving in with him and all that stuff.

01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:23.280
But it just, it just happened.

01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:24.880
And when it happened, it was kind of one of those things.

01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:27.280
It's like, Oh, well, I knew Dan online for years.

01:57:27.280 --> 01:57:27.760
Yeah.

01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:31.040
And this is, you know, when I was in Alabama and had no,

01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:34.320
I was actually saving up my money to go to Anime Expo,

01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:37.520
which is the money that I use for my plane ticket to fly out here in the first place.

01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:43.040
But I mean, I had known Dan forever online and it just happened.

01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:50.400
I mean, uh, techness says it's because the women who say that are usually dating assholes

01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:52.240
in our chat room at chat.org.com.

01:57:52.240 --> 01:57:55.920
I was always dating nice guys, which is true.

01:57:56.480 --> 01:58:00.000
Like, except for the one girl I went out with who was kind of a bitch like me.

01:58:00.000 --> 01:58:02.000
That was pretty fun, but it's Alabama.

01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:06.560
And you don't, I won't even go there about it being Alabama.

01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:12.720
But I had, I'd broken up with every guy that I had gone out with because he was too nice.

01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:17.760
I went as someone who would argue with me and not treat me like I was, you know,

01:58:18.720 --> 01:58:22.080
made of, of fragile eggshell and porcelain.

01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:23.280
And Dan doesn't treat me like that.

01:58:23.280 --> 01:58:28.640
He treats me like I'm an equal and like I'm his partner, not just, you know, his woman.

01:58:28.640 --> 01:58:29.200
You know what I mean?

01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:31.840
So, all right.

01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:34.080
Also, I was going to say, because you're in the friend zone,

01:58:34.080 --> 01:58:37.040
that's why they say that I wish, you know, that's why you hear that.

01:58:37.040 --> 01:58:38.080
Ooh, the friend zone.

01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:41.600
Because they can discuss these, these, uh, woman to woman things with you.

01:58:42.320 --> 01:58:44.080
You know, I will say, I will say something else.

01:58:45.760 --> 01:58:49.840
I have had guys come back and say I was interested, you know, come back and say

01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:54.880
they were interested and I'll flat out evaluate would I have dated this person.

01:58:54.880 --> 01:58:59.040
And for the most part, I can safely say no, like I'm not going to name names,

01:58:59.040 --> 01:59:02.080
but there was someone who said he was interested in me until he found out I was married.

01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:05.360
And I just flat out said, well, not to be a bitch about this,

01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:06.400
but I wouldn't have gone out with you.

01:59:06.960 --> 01:59:09.040
And this is why I wouldn't have gone out with you.

01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:12.080
So if I'm the kind of person that you're looking for,

01:59:12.080 --> 01:59:13.840
this is why I wouldn't have gone out with you.

01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:15.200
You know what I'm saying?

01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:17.360
Yeah, I do.

01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:20.160
And that's very helpful for those guys.

01:59:22.080 --> 01:59:23.200
Stop being neurotic.

01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:23.700
All right.

01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:25.920
Thank you for the questions, guys.

01:59:25.920 --> 01:59:28.080
We're going to move on with some video game news.

01:59:28.080 --> 01:59:31.600
Before we do, I have to notice one other thing I just noted was still in the shrink wrap.

01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:32.640
Going back to that earlier question.

01:59:32.640 --> 01:59:33.200
Look at this.

01:59:33.200 --> 01:59:36.800
I have the PlayStation Vita little ARG cards.

01:59:36.800 --> 01:59:38.000
The AR play cards.

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:38.960
Haven't taken them out.

01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:39.200
Good.

01:59:39.200 --> 01:59:41.280
You haven't figured out that the AR is broken.

01:59:41.280 --> 01:59:43.040
So it's really, it's well here.

01:59:43.040 --> 01:59:44.160
I have a use for them now.

01:59:44.160 --> 01:59:47.280
I'll put them on the Ustream cam since we suddenly have a video feed tonight.

01:59:47.280 --> 01:59:47.760
There you go.

01:59:48.320 --> 01:59:49.040
Look at the cards.

01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:53.040
You should kind of dried out looking pizza.

01:59:54.160 --> 01:59:56.160
They're like, it's terrible.

01:59:56.160 --> 02:00:01.200
I tried playing the soccer game and I spent like 15 minutes trying to get that damn thing

02:00:01.200 --> 02:00:01.700
to work.

02:00:02.320 --> 02:00:02.720
No.

02:00:02.720 --> 02:00:05.920
And I played the fireworks game and I was like, nope, don't care.

02:00:05.920 --> 02:00:08.240
It's just, it's a waste of time.

02:00:08.240 --> 02:00:13.280
It's neat, but you know, I need like an actual AR game that doesn't require cards.

02:00:13.280 --> 02:00:13.920
And that works.

02:00:13.920 --> 02:00:15.280
You know, that'd be nice if it worked.

02:00:16.320 --> 02:00:16.820
Just saying.

02:00:18.080 --> 02:00:18.400
All right.

02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:19.680
Let's move on with some more gaming news.

02:00:19.680 --> 02:00:21.600
The mailbag coming up shortly here in a moment.

02:00:21.600 --> 02:00:22.480
First off, Loki.

02:00:22.480 --> 02:00:22.800
All right.

02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:25.440
Let's talk a little bit about Sony.

02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:34.240
And I mean, I guess they kind of need to have like a, you know, their own Smash Brothers

02:00:34.240 --> 02:00:35.600
type game because hey, why not?

02:00:35.600 --> 02:00:36.800
Everyone else is doing it.

02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:41.440
So yes, they have, there was a rumor, of course, that they were putting out some sort of like

02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:44.720
game that's going to feature all the PlayStation All-Stars and that kind of stuff.

02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:49.040
Well, now they've actually registered a domain called PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale.

02:00:49.680 --> 02:00:52.560
And it is looking to be like that game.

02:00:52.560 --> 02:00:56.960
Something with maybe all their first party franchise characters from like Heavenly Sword

02:00:56.960 --> 02:00:58.400
to God of War.

02:00:58.400 --> 02:01:00.720
Although Heavenly Sword, does anyone really remember that game?

02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:01.920
I do.

02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:05.520
So they're going to have all these different characters fighting each other.

02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:09.280
Maybe in some sort of Smash Brothers type way.

02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:12.960
Originally, I guess it was on their working title, Title Fight.

02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:19.840
Rumored to be announced actually this week on Spike TV's The Game Trailers TV show.

02:01:19.840 --> 02:01:21.920
So when's that show on?

02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:22.420
Thursday.

02:01:23.520 --> 02:01:27.120
So I guess we'll find out this week if that's the case.

02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:28.720
Most likely probably going to be the case.

02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:31.920
So neat, I guess.

02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:35.060
I don't know.

02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:38.020
Cool.

02:01:39.040 --> 02:01:41.520
We'll see how this really kind of works.

02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:46.240
Well, I mean, obviously they're going to kind of take the successful Super Smash Brothers

02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:47.920
format and put their own spin on it.

02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:53.200
I mean, it's yeah, I don't know if they have quite the recognizable lineup of character.

02:01:53.200 --> 02:01:57.200
Well, I don't think I can really throw that kind of shade at it because, you know, there

02:01:57.200 --> 02:01:58.560
are some big characters.

02:01:58.560 --> 02:01:59.760
They're just like, I don't see.

02:01:59.760 --> 02:02:03.440
I mean, like, there's no, like, this is not a kart racing game.

02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:04.960
You know, they have a little big planet for that.

02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:06.320
But here's the thing.

02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:10.800
Like Nintendo, you know, Smash Brothers makes sense because there's really no emirated

02:02:10.800 --> 02:02:13.360
characters in Nintendo's kind of lineup.

02:02:13.360 --> 02:02:17.440
They're all kind of that, you know, family friendly type stuff.

02:02:17.440 --> 02:02:24.720
Whereas you have Sweet Tooth versus Sackboy or Ratchet and Clank or something like that.

02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:26.800
That just doesn't make any sense.

02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:30.320
Now, I do have to say now they should be edgy with this.

02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:33.840
They should really go all out with this kind of title fight thing.

02:02:34.880 --> 02:02:40.560
I think they need to have, first off, Kevin Butler needs to be a playable character as

02:02:40.560 --> 02:02:45.440
is also the creepy baby from their commercials needs to be a character as well.

02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:47.120
And that would be awesome.

02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:54.720
But yes, I wonder if they'll get any crossover things, you know, kind of like how they finally

02:02:54.720 --> 02:03:00.480
got like Snake and Smash Brothers and Sonic and some of that.

02:03:00.480 --> 02:03:01.600
You think any of that will happen?

02:03:01.600 --> 02:03:02.720
That'd be kind of cool.

02:03:02.720 --> 02:03:03.520
I mean, I don't know.

02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:09.120
Maybe I could see them, you know, like doing like the like the commercial with like the

02:03:09.120 --> 02:03:11.840
resistance people and the Call of Duty guys and stuff like that.

02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:12.880
Maybe they'll have something like that.

02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:16.320
And Bob or Mike or whatever his name was, Michael, dude.

02:03:17.920 --> 02:03:22.160
Maybe your PlayStation home character, because God, I don't ever play that.

02:03:22.160 --> 02:03:25.040
SSJ100Matt says, can we kill that Marcus PSP kid?

02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:27.600
That would be hilarious.

02:03:27.600 --> 02:03:29.920
But no, it's probably not going to be the case.

02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:30.320
All right.

02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:34.720
EA story, very controversial company these days.

02:03:34.720 --> 02:03:44.720
Um, Eurogamer had a report this week that in the UK, EA person Keith Ramsdale, one of

02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:49.120
the executives at EA announced that EA is going to develop an online universe for all

02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:50.080
its franchises.

02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:55.760
He didn't say like multiplayer necessarily, but a cross-platform major tie-in approach

02:03:55.760 --> 02:04:01.440
to games and basically pulling in any gadget you can think of, iPhone, Xbox, whatever.

02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:02.480
Football grenade.

02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:06.720
Quote, imagine a player gets up in the morning, plays an online match on his 360 before going

02:04:06.720 --> 02:04:08.720
to work on the bus, on his way to work.

02:04:08.720 --> 02:04:11.680
He practices his free kicks on his tablet at lunch.

02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:14.720
He looks on the transfer window on his PC on the way home.

02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:16.480
He chooses his kit on the smartphone.

02:04:16.480 --> 02:04:17.040
Here's the thing.

02:04:17.040 --> 02:04:21.200
When he gets home to play again on his 360 that evening, all his accounts been hacked

02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:24.160
and the people have charged FIFA DLC points.

02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:25.600
All right.

02:04:28.640 --> 02:04:31.600
All those achievements and upgrade will be alive in his game.

02:04:31.600 --> 02:04:32.400
Here's the thing.

02:04:32.400 --> 02:04:32.640
Okay.

02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:36.160
So as much as EA is talking about this unified network, you know, I kind of thought this

02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:37.280
was already happening.

02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:42.080
And EA had a very our way or the highway mentality, and that's how they got away with a lot of

02:04:42.080 --> 02:04:43.440
stuff on the Xbox.

02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:50.160
I mean, even the way I bought Mass Effect 2 DLC, you kind of had to go online and tie

02:04:50.160 --> 02:04:52.320
in the Cerberus account online.

02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:53.440
And then that opens up the DLC.

02:04:53.440 --> 02:04:56.640
I thought it was ridiculous, but EA is being very possessive about it.

02:04:56.640 --> 02:05:00.080
Well, yeah, they wanted to go that way so that you have to buy your fucking online

02:05:00.080 --> 02:05:03.920
passes for every game because they're like, shit, you know, this offline game, how are

02:05:03.920 --> 02:05:05.360
we going to sell an online pass for it?

02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:08.800
I mean, because, yeah, that may have worked once with Kingdoms of Amal or Reckoning, but

02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:12.400
people are going to start figuring out that this game isn't online.

02:05:12.400 --> 02:05:14.560
Why are they charging an online password?

02:05:14.560 --> 02:05:16.960
So now they have to add their stupid little online component.

02:05:16.960 --> 02:05:19.360
Really, all they're doing is just copying Call of Duty Elite.

02:05:19.360 --> 02:05:20.960
I mean, that's what everybody's doing now.

02:05:20.960 --> 02:05:24.000
I mean, that's what, you know, Rockstar is doing with...

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:27.920
Actually, to be fair, Rockstar kind of was doing it before Call of Duty Elite with their

02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:30.800
social club stuff because they have that span across other games.

02:05:30.800 --> 02:05:32.560
Then there's Ubisoft with their Uplay stuff.

02:05:32.560 --> 02:05:35.840
I think they're doing something a little different with, like, I want to say it's their Ghost

02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:39.520
Recon Network or something like that for the new Ghost Recon Future Soldier.

02:05:39.520 --> 02:05:41.920
But then they have, you know, Call of Duty Elite.

02:05:41.920 --> 02:05:46.000
They only have these different community things with apps and crap that you can tweak your

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:46.560
stuff in game.

02:05:47.600 --> 02:05:54.960
Honestly, honestly, is it really going to take, what, like five seconds to configure

02:05:54.960 --> 02:05:58.560
your fucking soccer player or whatever when you get home?

02:05:58.560 --> 02:06:00.320
I mean, do you really have to bring...

02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:04.240
Well, of course, I guess if you're this type of guy that brings your fucking tablet and

02:06:04.240 --> 02:06:10.800
phone to work, you know, with you and shit, then I guess you want to, you know, get shit

02:06:10.800 --> 02:06:11.760
done right away.

02:06:11.760 --> 02:06:14.320
But I don't know.

02:06:14.320 --> 02:06:15.440
I mean, it's a little excessive.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.960
Cool if they're going to do that, but, you know, once again, I think it's just to sell

02:06:18.960 --> 02:06:20.160
those online passes.

02:06:20.160 --> 02:06:26.640
And, I mean, if it adds value, then neat, but, I don't know, they've kind of actually,

02:06:26.640 --> 02:06:28.720
I think they've done that also with Need for Speed.

02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:31.760
They had their auto log or something like that.

02:06:32.480 --> 02:06:35.600
So, yeah, they're kind of already doing this.

02:06:36.720 --> 02:06:38.000
That's the way everything's going.

02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:41.520
They need to have some way to drive people to keep playing their games.

02:06:42.800 --> 02:06:44.240
And not sell them used.

02:06:44.240 --> 02:06:44.800
I guess.

02:06:45.440 --> 02:06:48.640
All right, so you get to hear the same music, theme music again, because it doubles for

02:06:48.640 --> 02:06:50.400
the mailbag music every week.

02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:54.080
You guys send us emails at mailbag at orange launcher dot com and dark soccer dives into

02:06:54.080 --> 02:06:56.480
the email bag head first and pulls out some emails.

02:06:56.480 --> 02:06:58.800
She thinks she ought to share with the rest of us.

02:07:00.560 --> 02:07:02.960
Um, no, this is from April 12th.

02:07:02.960 --> 02:07:04.480
So disclaimers and everything.

02:07:05.520 --> 02:07:10.800
Um, I haven't heard a lot about Assassin's Creed on the show, and I was wondering why

02:07:10.800 --> 02:07:13.360
it isn't a big subject on, um, on here.

02:07:13.360 --> 02:07:14.480
It's stellar series.

02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:18.880
And I really think the story is underestimated by its gameplay being the main attraction.

02:07:18.880 --> 02:07:19.920
What do you guys think?

02:07:19.920 --> 02:07:21.520
There's another game series that I play.

02:07:21.520 --> 02:07:22.320
I'm like, fuck this.

02:07:22.320 --> 02:07:23.600
I'm not playing this anymore.

02:07:23.600 --> 02:07:23.840
Really?

02:07:23.840 --> 02:07:24.480
You didn't like it?

02:07:24.480 --> 02:07:25.760
I didn't like Assassin's Creed.

02:07:25.760 --> 02:07:27.280
I've heard a lot of good things about it.

02:07:27.280 --> 02:07:33.040
Um, it's, it's kind of mass effect to me where I just, I saw it really quickly and I was

02:07:33.040 --> 02:07:36.400
like, oh, I'm playing too much wow right now to get into Assassin's Creed.

02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:37.920
I have a lot of friends that are really into it.

02:07:37.920 --> 02:07:43.120
It is on my list to get to at some point, but you know, we can't play everything.

02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:48.160
I'm actually interested in playing Assassin's Creed 2 just because I love, um, how fucked

02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:54.720
up the Medici family was and it has a lot to do with, uh, Renaissance Italy at the time.

02:07:55.360 --> 02:07:58.800
And it's funny, my Renaissance art history teacher, her daughter's playing the game

02:07:59.600 --> 02:08:04.800
and, uh, she's, uh, you know, pointing out like the Palazzio and all these different

02:08:04.800 --> 02:08:06.160
places and saying, oh yeah.

02:08:06.160 --> 02:08:10.880
And so-and-so de Medici was killed here, you know, cause they're all busy popes and killing

02:08:10.880 --> 02:08:11.440
each other.

02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:13.520
I'm just saying.

02:08:13.520 --> 02:08:14.240
Next email.

02:08:14.240 --> 02:08:15.120
Oh, that was from Danny.

02:08:15.840 --> 02:08:16.480
Next email.

02:08:17.200 --> 02:08:18.320
Hey guys, Styrlok here.

02:08:18.320 --> 02:08:18.960
Welcome back.

02:08:18.960 --> 02:08:22.640
I was listening to some random video game soundtracks the other day and had an interesting

02:08:22.640 --> 02:08:25.360
thought for a possible topic to talk about.

02:08:25.360 --> 02:08:27.600
And I'm curious what your answer will be.

02:08:27.600 --> 02:08:32.160
It seems that sometimes that random game will come along that completely sucks, but can

02:08:32.160 --> 02:08:34.240
defy all logic by having a kick ass soundtrack.

02:08:34.800 --> 02:08:38.720
The two that jumped to my mind right away are Unlimited Saga for PS2 and Spider-Man

02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:40.640
and the X-Men arcades revenge on the SNES.

02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:44.080
What games do you think of that will fit this criteria?

02:08:44.080 --> 02:08:46.960
Obviously opinion based, but curious what you guys come up with.

02:08:47.520 --> 02:08:50.400
I don't know why, but my mind goes very, very old school.

02:08:50.400 --> 02:08:52.960
And one of the first games I think of was Goonies 2.

02:08:53.920 --> 02:08:57.760
I don't know why the NES had a stellar soundtrack for the 8-bit days.

02:08:57.760 --> 02:08:58.240
Oh yeah.

02:08:58.800 --> 02:09:00.640
Actually, Dan really loves that game.

02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:05.600
Yeah, but the game itself was, I mean, it takes some getting into, but then like once

02:09:05.600 --> 02:09:09.680
you really do get into it, you're like, wow, this game, I don't give this game enough credit,

02:09:09.680 --> 02:09:11.920
but that was really where the soundtrack was so good.

02:09:11.920 --> 02:09:13.280
I had to like play more of it.

02:09:14.080 --> 02:09:19.040
Well, I liked even, I'm not going to say it was a bad game, but it just wasn't that in

02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:19.280
depth.

02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:19.920
It wasn't that hard.

02:09:19.920 --> 02:09:25.120
Strider 2 had a fantastic soundtrack, but really easy gameplay.

02:09:25.120 --> 02:09:27.520
But for me, a lot of it was just how awesome the music was.

02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:29.040
And oh my gosh, Strider, here are you.

02:09:29.040 --> 02:09:30.400
I got a great answer for this.

02:09:30.400 --> 02:09:32.160
Final Fantasy Mystic Quest.

02:09:32.160 --> 02:09:32.640
Yeah.

02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:34.480
It's kind of a crap RPG.

02:09:35.200 --> 02:09:35.520
It's all right.

02:09:35.520 --> 02:09:38.560
It's got a decent story, but the soundtrack was so good.

02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:40.320
And it wasn't, it wasn't no Buimatsu either.

02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:43.920
People are going to poop on me for this, but Paperboy.

02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:47.120
I don't like Paperboy, but I love the music in it.

02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:49.920
I can see that.

02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:52.480
I just thought it was funny.

02:09:52.480 --> 02:09:53.040
I can see that.

02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:53.680
I am.

02:09:53.680 --> 02:09:55.040
I really am not any good at Paperboy.

02:09:55.040 --> 02:09:56.560
Paperboy is a weird ass game.

02:09:56.560 --> 02:09:57.200
It is.

02:09:57.200 --> 02:09:59.680
But I, I mean, I love watching other people play it.

02:09:59.680 --> 02:10:00.160
That's the thing.

02:10:00.160 --> 02:10:01.520
But I hate playing it myself.

02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:09.200
Um, Agdeft and Artarum says, meh, Sonic games.

02:10:09.200 --> 02:10:11.360
You know, Sonic Adventure 2 had a good soundtrack.

02:10:11.360 --> 02:10:12.480
Anything you can think of, Loki?

02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:14.320
A stall on the Sega Saturn.

02:10:15.440 --> 02:10:16.560
That's a random pick.

02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:17.120
Why that one?

02:10:17.120 --> 02:10:18.320
A stall is kind of neat.

02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:18.960
I love it.

02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:20.560
It was, it was a great soundtrack.

02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:27.200
I actually recorded on my cassette tape because I played the music on the Saturn when I rented

02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:28.960
the console to play the game.

02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:30.880
I have an answer for this.

02:10:30.880 --> 02:10:33.440
It's going to get me a lot of shit, but you all know it's true.

02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:38.480
This game actually isn't that good, but it's the soundtrack that keeps you coming back

02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:42.720
because it wasn't as good on Xbox Live Arcade as it was on the Dreamcast.

02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:44.960
Crazy Taxi.

02:10:44.960 --> 02:10:45.520
Hell yeah.

02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:52.720
But Crazy Taxi was kind of a crappy game, but it's that song.

02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:54.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:10:54.800 --> 02:10:58.400
Or the combination of Offspring and Bad Religion.

02:10:58.400 --> 02:11:04.960
It just wasn't the same, which were two bands I was so into when that game came out.

02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:06.400
I freaking love Bad Religion.

02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:11.280
Um, God, there was another game that just popped into my head and then it popped out

02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:12.640
the moment you said Crazy Taxi.

02:11:12.640 --> 02:11:19.200
So, you know, I would say the PlayStation version of Grandia.

02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:24.080
I tried, you know, I was playing it on the Genesis because the Genesis version is so

02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:27.840
much better, but I still tried to play it on the PlayStation just so I could hear the

02:11:27.840 --> 02:11:28.400
good music.

02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:29.600
Hey, come on over.

02:11:29.600 --> 02:11:31.600
Have some fun with Crazy Taxi.

02:11:32.400 --> 02:11:32.880
Okay.

02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:37.760
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:11:37.760 --> 02:11:39.200
Let's run over some bitches.

02:11:40.480 --> 02:11:42.800
Hey, you're dragging too fast.

02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:43.300
Shut up.

02:11:44.880 --> 02:11:46.080
I know what I'm doing.

02:11:49.120 --> 02:11:52.800
I mean, that song was already big before Crazy Taxi.

02:11:52.800 --> 02:11:54.720
Like, I remember that song in high school and stuff.

02:11:54.720 --> 02:11:58.720
And then, like, when that game came out, it was just like that game will forever be or

02:11:58.720 --> 02:12:00.880
that song will forever be associated with Crazy Taxi.

02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:01.680
Okay.

02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:05.760
I know another game just because I liked the music in it, believe it or not.

02:12:05.760 --> 02:12:07.200
Was that stupid Avatar game?

02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:11.120
Yeah, you're on your own there.

02:12:11.120 --> 02:12:15.520
And I was going back and watching the cut scenes from Tron Evolution and that was good

02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:16.080
music.

02:12:16.080 --> 02:12:17.120
No, I'll give you that.

02:12:17.120 --> 02:12:19.680
Because, I mean, it was pretty much the Daft Punk stuff, but yeah.

02:12:20.240 --> 02:12:21.040
All right.

02:12:21.040 --> 02:12:21.600
More emails?

02:12:22.240 --> 02:12:22.720
Yes.

02:12:22.720 --> 02:12:23.040
Okay.

02:12:23.040 --> 02:12:26.960
Um, let me go ahead and close the one from our friend, Strlock.

02:12:28.560 --> 02:12:29.520
Hi, gang!

02:12:29.520 --> 02:12:30.320
Hope you had an-

02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:32.320
Hi, overexcited person!

02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:35.520
Hope you had an awesome time in Electronica last week.

02:12:35.520 --> 02:12:35.920
I did.

02:12:36.560 --> 02:12:37.060
Bitch.

02:12:38.160 --> 02:12:39.680
Thank you for my Duffy outfit.

02:12:39.680 --> 02:12:40.180
You're welcome.

02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:44.800
While you lot were having fun, I didn't get to go, so it was just while Rob was having

02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:49.200
fun, I was forced to help my parents decide which of my childhood memories I wanted to

02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:51.120
destroy for all time, hint none.

02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:53.360
Good lord, this sounds like a terrible reality show.

02:12:54.960 --> 02:12:58.560
While sorting through all my stuff, I found my old Master System 2.

02:12:58.560 --> 02:13:03.440
Maybe because all the episodes of Game Center CX I've been watching, maybe it's the fact

02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:06.480
that you mentioned Castle of Illusion last time, but I felt like I had to plug it in

02:13:06.480 --> 02:13:08.560
and get me a fix of retro gaming.

02:13:08.560 --> 02:13:12.160
I was surprised that it still works perfectly and that I still remembered how to plug it

02:13:12.160 --> 02:13:13.600
in and tune the TV.

02:13:13.600 --> 02:13:17.120
Flicking through channels and suddenly I saw the lo-fi Sega appear.

02:13:17.120 --> 02:13:18.640
It's heartwarming experience.

02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:22.080
Wait a minute, is Master System 2 what they call the Genesis overseas?

02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:24.400
Uh, I don't know.

02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:28.240
The Genesis was called the Mega Drive.

02:13:28.240 --> 02:13:29.520
That's right, that's right.

02:13:29.520 --> 02:13:30.480
It's like Castle of Illusion.

02:13:30.480 --> 02:13:31.600
Was that on the Master System?

02:13:32.160 --> 02:13:33.120
They did it in Brazil.

02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:34.800
Oh, all right.

02:13:34.800 --> 02:13:39.920
But anyway, um, I've never really been one for retro gaming.

02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:44.320
I got MS2 pretty late and missed the 16-bit era entirely.

02:13:44.320 --> 02:13:48.320
I never really grew up on video games in that way, but picking a game, blowing into the

02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:54.560
cartridge and inserting it while imitating a Reno's Game Center CX kachow on was fun.

02:13:54.560 --> 02:13:56.080
Of course I've never seen that show.

02:13:56.080 --> 02:13:59.280
The games I used to play were pretty much exactly as I remembered them.

02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:01.840
The fun, uncomplicated, and pretty tough.

02:14:02.560 --> 02:14:04.640
They just all seemed charming.

02:14:04.640 --> 02:14:08.880
The old school graphics, the epic music, all real undeniable charm.

02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:12.000
The only thing I found surprising was how slow the games felt.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:13.360
Sonic especially.

02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:16.240
Maybe just a case of badly ported PAL games?

02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:20.720
Unfortunately, I didn't get to spend too much time playing it, but I'd like to say it's

02:14:20.720 --> 02:14:27.280
a pleasure, no, it's thanks to you guys and GCCX that I really had a renewed interest

02:14:27.280 --> 02:14:28.400
in the pleasure of retro gaming.

02:14:28.400 --> 02:14:31.200
Thanks, OLR, and that's from the OLR.

02:14:32.480 --> 02:14:36.000
PS, when it comes to retro gaming, do you prefer playing old games on a modern console

02:14:36.000 --> 02:14:38.240
is better than playing them on their original consoles?

02:14:38.240 --> 02:14:39.760
PPS, bonus images for you.

02:14:40.880 --> 02:14:42.240
This is, uh, Picaruno.

02:14:42.240 --> 02:14:51.280
Um, I like to play retro games on newer consoles just because, you know, getting it on my new

02:14:51.280 --> 02:14:55.760
TV and everything, it's really hard to hook up an Atari 2600 to a modern HDTV.

02:14:55.760 --> 02:14:57.600
You kind of can't do it without converters.

02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:03.520
You know, I saw his Twitter this week with all the, um, Sonic Chaos and all that.

02:15:03.520 --> 02:15:04.000
R-Type.

02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:05.520
Oh, I fucking love R-Type.

02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:07.440
Good times.

02:15:07.440 --> 02:15:09.200
No, I fucking love R-Type.

02:15:09.200 --> 02:15:11.120
You want to talk about good video game music?

02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:12.400
R-Type.

02:15:12.400 --> 02:15:15.760
You need to find the opening music for R-Type for me right now, Rob, or I will cry.

02:15:15.760 --> 02:15:19.600
You know, I forgot to mention in my games that I played in the last two weeks, but I

02:15:19.600 --> 02:15:23.200
actually played through both, uh, Sexy Parodius and Parodius Da.

02:15:23.200 --> 02:15:24.480
I love Parodius too.

02:15:26.320 --> 02:15:28.240
Have you ever played Chatting Parodius?

02:15:28.240 --> 02:15:28.740
No.

02:15:29.520 --> 02:15:30.880
You should play Chatting Parodius.

02:15:32.320 --> 02:15:32.800
Excuse me.

02:15:32.800 --> 02:15:34.720
This may or may not be the song you were looking for.

02:15:34.720 --> 02:15:36.320
I don't know this game as well as you do.

02:15:36.320 --> 02:15:37.280
Nope, that's not.

02:15:37.280 --> 02:15:38.000
Yep, that's his.

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:41.680
Wait, bitch, let it start before you make the call.

02:15:50.480 --> 02:15:51.440
All right, I gotta watch how much-

02:15:51.440 --> 02:15:52.240
Here we go, here's the part.

02:15:56.480 --> 02:15:59.760
This is like my favorite piece of video game music ever.

02:15:59.760 --> 02:16:01.840
We gotta watch how much of this we play on Ustream.

02:16:01.840 --> 02:16:04.000
They have very- they have a zero tolerance on piracy.

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.320
Okay, well, it's on YouTube, so whatever.

02:16:06.320 --> 02:16:12.480
Um, you know, I would actually have to say, and this is why Dan and I have such a big,

02:16:13.040 --> 02:16:19.440
um, classic game console, uh, collection, is because we really do like playing them on

02:16:19.440 --> 02:16:20.800
their intended consoles.

02:16:21.360 --> 02:16:25.520
You know, I mean, sometimes I like going back and playing a few, you know, things on a newer

02:16:25.520 --> 02:16:29.280
console if that, you know, happens to be what I have hooked up and say that, you know, oh,

02:16:29.280 --> 02:16:33.840
the Neo Geo is at Dan's mom's house because we have a bunch of our game stuff in storage

02:16:33.840 --> 02:16:34.720
at her place.

02:16:34.720 --> 02:16:40.800
Well, I can't very well go grab the Neo Geo and play anything, so I guess I can play King

02:16:40.800 --> 02:16:43.760
of Fighters on the Dreamcast or something.

02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:44.560
You know, I'm just saying.

02:16:45.360 --> 02:16:49.280
So it depends on convenience, but if I've got it there, I will hook up the old stuff

02:16:49.280 --> 02:16:49.760
and play it.

02:16:50.640 --> 02:16:51.600
Hail to the fuck yeah.

02:16:52.880 --> 02:16:54.240
All right, is that it for the mailbag?

02:16:54.240 --> 02:16:55.200
No, we have two more.

02:16:55.200 --> 02:16:55.760
Oh my God.

02:16:56.560 --> 02:16:59.520
Hey, we've been gone for two freaking weeks.

02:16:59.520 --> 02:17:00.160
I guess that's true.

02:17:00.160 --> 02:17:04.720
Hey, OLR, Defective Candy here, just emailing to announce my boyfriend or I are the new

02:17:04.720 --> 02:17:06.800
proud parents of our only arcade cabinet.

02:17:07.440 --> 02:17:12.240
I picked it up on Craigslist for $70, needed a little work, but the wood alone to build

02:17:12.240 --> 02:17:14.000
one from scratch would have run us over $100.

02:17:14.720 --> 02:17:18.480
We were thinking of turning it into a main cabinet, a PC based system that uses emulators.

02:17:18.480 --> 02:17:19.120
Yes, we know.

02:17:19.760 --> 02:17:22.320
Just because the game card is shot.

02:17:22.320 --> 02:17:26.400
The original cabinet was from Data Pro, although I am unsure what game originally came with

02:17:26.400 --> 02:17:26.560
it.

02:17:26.560 --> 02:17:28.960
It had WWF Wrestlefest in it.

02:17:28.960 --> 02:17:30.080
I remember that game.

02:17:30.080 --> 02:17:33.200
I found out Data Pro was a large manufacturer of mostly pinball machines.

02:17:33.200 --> 02:17:35.520
I was wondering if Dark Soccer was familiar with the brand.

02:17:35.520 --> 02:17:38.720
I am familiar with them, but I don't think that they put out much that was good.

02:17:38.720 --> 02:17:39.680
I can double check that.

02:17:40.320 --> 02:17:44.240
I know it was Gottlieb that put out that TMNT table.

02:17:44.240 --> 02:17:44.960
I'll have to check.

02:17:46.320 --> 02:17:49.680
Anyway, I wanted to thank you guys for keeping me in the gaming world all these years and

02:17:49.680 --> 02:17:52.240
inspire me to follow my dreams of buying my own cabinet.

02:17:52.240 --> 02:17:56.160
I think the bug has really bitten us and we already went out to make a bar top cabinet

02:17:56.160 --> 02:17:58.800
next and keep you updated on the status of our work.

02:17:58.800 --> 02:18:00.000
Cheers, Defective Candy.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:01.360
I want a bar top cabinet.

02:18:01.360 --> 02:18:01.840
You know what?

02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:03.200
They're more expensive than you think.

02:18:03.200 --> 02:18:04.240
Here's the machine.

02:18:06.240 --> 02:18:07.920
WWF Wrestlefest.

02:18:07.920 --> 02:18:09.680
What a cheap piece of crap.

02:18:09.680 --> 02:18:12.080
But it's your piece of crap and congratulations.

02:18:12.080 --> 02:18:12.560
That's great.

02:18:12.560 --> 02:18:13.200
And you know what?

02:18:13.200 --> 02:18:14.640
That'll be great for the maim.

02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:17.040
Exactly what Defective Candy is talking about in the email.

02:18:17.040 --> 02:18:18.080
It'll be a great thing.

02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:20.640
We built ours out of an old stand-up pole position.

02:18:20.640 --> 02:18:21.280
Our last one.

02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:28.480
Just be careful with what you're building your system out of because you need to have

02:18:28.480 --> 02:18:30.000
the right graphics card for it.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:33.680
I think, uh, there's drivers.

02:18:33.680 --> 02:18:34.720
You can find the specs online.

02:18:34.720 --> 02:18:36.480
Well, yeah, you can get special drivers.

02:18:36.480 --> 02:18:40.560
Like, um, I have, uh, what do I have?

02:18:40.560 --> 02:18:46.160
I ended up, before I was using an arcade VGA card, I recommend not going through that route

02:18:46.160 --> 02:18:49.200
because the arcade VGA cards are usually a little bit old.

02:18:49.200 --> 02:18:51.120
Although the newer ones though are newer models.

02:18:51.120 --> 02:18:57.280
But I ended up going with an ATI card and then they have special drivers that you can

02:18:57.280 --> 02:19:02.400
get that will do the low-res scaling for you.

02:19:02.400 --> 02:19:10.320
And then also, um, you want to get the, uh, the JAMA adapter for, uh, the J-Pack.

02:19:10.320 --> 02:19:11.280
J-Packs are awesome.

02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:12.000
You need to get that.

02:19:12.880 --> 02:19:18.160
And, uh, also be careful that you buy good buttons that won't wear out quickly.

02:19:19.280 --> 02:19:21.200
For a cabinet like that, you don't need good buttons.

02:19:21.200 --> 02:19:22.000
It doesn't matter.

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:23.840
I mean, the buttons are, like, so damn cheap.

02:19:23.840 --> 02:19:25.760
They're like 50 cents.

02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:26.720
Yeah.

02:19:27.920 --> 02:19:29.840
Um, the last email.

02:19:31.040 --> 02:19:33.680
Have any of you played Pier Solar?

02:19:33.680 --> 02:19:38.320
It's an RPG created for the Sega Genesis but was originally released in 2008.

02:19:38.320 --> 02:19:42.800
A reprint of the game recently sold out and they will probably release it again at some

02:19:42.800 --> 02:19:43.440
point.

02:19:43.440 --> 02:19:47.360
It's a really well-made game and does something no other Genesis game has done before that

02:19:47.360 --> 02:19:48.240
I know of.

02:19:48.240 --> 02:19:52.240
If you purchase the companion CD soundtrack, you can play the Genesis cart using the CD

02:19:52.240 --> 02:19:55.680
soundtrack in the Sega CD drive for the in-game music.

02:19:55.680 --> 02:19:59.840
The developer, Watermelon Games, is currently working on a new Genesis Mega Drive game,

02:19:59.840 --> 02:20:02.640
so check out their website if you are interested.

02:20:02.640 --> 02:20:05.760
Do you have any Genesis RPG recommendations?

02:20:08.240 --> 02:20:10.480
Um, Fantasy Star 4?

02:20:12.320 --> 02:20:15.600
Any of the Fantasy Stars, really, although that's kind of an obvious answer.

02:20:15.600 --> 02:20:18.000
I- I don't remember this one.

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:22.320
I remember some of the Genesis games that came out later.

02:20:22.320 --> 02:20:26.080
Bobby had had one of the folks on his show a few years ago.

02:20:26.080 --> 02:20:28.960
Um, I don't remember that one, though.

02:20:28.960 --> 02:20:32.800
It's awesome that people are still making games, though, for Genesis, but they still

02:20:32.800 --> 02:20:34.880
do it for like Atari 2600 and all that.

02:20:34.880 --> 02:20:36.000
Genesis RPGs?

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:37.520
I didn't own a Genesis growing up.

02:20:37.520 --> 02:20:38.800
There's a website for it.

02:20:38.800 --> 02:20:41.840
This is a really hard question for me because I didn't own a Genesis growing up.

02:20:42.400 --> 02:20:46.240
Um, and my friends, you know, the games we would play would be Mortal Kombat because

02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:49.200
it had the blood and Street Fighter Championship Edition.

02:20:49.200 --> 02:20:52.800
Role-playing games on Genesis that weren't Fantasy Star.

02:20:52.800 --> 02:20:55.120
Um, Dark Sakura?

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.560
Um, you know, I was a SNES person growing up.

02:20:58.560 --> 02:20:58.880
Thank you.

02:20:58.880 --> 02:20:59.600
Bobby reminded me.

02:20:59.600 --> 02:21:00.800
It was called Beggar Prince.

02:21:00.800 --> 02:21:01.200
Thank you.

02:21:01.200 --> 02:21:02.080
I knew- I was like-

02:21:02.800 --> 02:21:07.920
I- I grew up playing Chrono Trigger in the Final Fantasies, so- but, I mean, I've gone

02:21:07.920 --> 02:21:08.160
back.

02:21:08.160 --> 02:21:17.600
We picked up, um, the Sega Ages, uh, 2500 copy of, uh, Fantasy Star, which we had our

02:21:17.600 --> 02:21:20.800
friend Krista translate for us while we were playing through it.

02:21:20.800 --> 02:21:25.760
So, I mean, I- I never really got too much into the Genesis one.

02:21:25.760 --> 02:21:26.160
Sorry.

02:21:26.160 --> 02:21:28.400
I mean, I did play some of the Sega CD ones.

02:21:28.400 --> 02:21:33.680
Like, it wasn't really an RPG, but I did play Popful Mail, you know, and I played Lunar.

02:21:33.680 --> 02:21:35.840
I had those.

02:21:35.840 --> 02:21:36.640
Lunar is awesome.

02:21:39.040 --> 02:21:39.440
I don't know.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:44.400
I didn't have a Genesis, not until long after Genesis was done.

02:21:45.440 --> 02:21:45.680
Yeah.

02:21:45.680 --> 02:21:53.760
And even then, it was just Sonic and Vectorman and-

02:21:53.760 --> 02:21:54.960
Vectorman's pretty awesome.

02:21:54.960 --> 02:21:57.120
I don't remember where the hell else we had.

02:21:59.920 --> 02:22:00.320
What's that?

02:22:00.320 --> 02:22:00.960
A big booger?

02:22:01.600 --> 02:22:02.640
It's a chuzzle.

02:22:02.640 --> 02:22:02.880
Oh.

02:22:04.160 --> 02:22:07.760
I'm trying to entertain- since we're forced to use a- well, we're not really forced to

02:22:07.760 --> 02:22:11.200
use a webcam on Ustream, but, you know, it's weird to not have one.

02:22:11.200 --> 02:22:14.000
I've just been putting random objects in front of the camera because we're shy.

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:15.040
It's a radio show.

02:22:15.040 --> 02:22:17.920
Well, I've got one more paragraph.

02:22:17.920 --> 02:22:18.240
All right.

02:22:18.800 --> 02:22:20.400
Good luck with the move to a new station.

02:22:20.400 --> 02:22:22.800
Your fans will follow you, so don't worry about that.

02:22:22.800 --> 02:22:26.160
Looking on the bright side, it sounds like Bobby will update his podcast feed, which

02:22:26.160 --> 02:22:27.920
hasn't been done in a couple of years.

02:22:27.920 --> 02:22:28.480
Yes!

02:22:28.480 --> 02:22:31.760
This is a great opportunity for Bobby to turn over a new leaf.

02:22:31.760 --> 02:22:32.080
Yes.

02:22:32.080 --> 02:22:33.760
And that's by Will.

02:22:33.760 --> 02:22:36.800
He sent a link, which I'm going to post in the chat room.

02:22:36.800 --> 02:22:38.400
He must have just written that in the past hour.

02:22:39.120 --> 02:22:39.360
Yeah.

02:22:40.080 --> 02:22:43.040
Well, it was, you know, there as of part A, so.

02:22:43.040 --> 02:22:43.520
There you go.

02:22:43.520 --> 02:22:46.160
But it's a link to, uh, Pier Solar.

02:22:46.960 --> 02:22:47.200
Awesome.

02:22:47.200 --> 02:22:49.040
So I might have to give this a try.

02:22:49.040 --> 02:22:50.960
There's a, is that a Pelican?

02:22:50.960 --> 02:22:51.760
Looks like a Pelican.

02:22:53.120 --> 02:22:55.040
All right, guys, let's move on.

02:22:55.040 --> 02:22:58.720
Oh, mailbag, of course, at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the website.

02:22:58.720 --> 02:23:00.720
If you want to send us your question for next week.

02:23:00.720 --> 02:23:02.160
We had a lot of questions tonight.

02:23:02.720 --> 02:23:04.560
Now it's not time for questions.

02:23:04.560 --> 02:23:14.400
It's time for Angst and Destruction.

02:23:24.560 --> 02:23:25.920
FUs of the Week, Dark Sakura.

02:23:25.920 --> 02:23:34.240
Um, FU being tired and having people not really understand the way that good design works.

02:23:35.200 --> 02:23:38.240
Um, committees, just committees.

02:23:38.240 --> 02:23:40.160
They should just let me do everything and take it.

02:23:40.720 --> 02:23:44.640
Um, also one on behalf of Becky, because I'm pissed off for her.

02:23:45.760 --> 02:23:50.880
Um, fuck those little things that try to put you into a category and then her teacher for

02:23:50.880 --> 02:23:52.320
making her write about it.

02:23:52.320 --> 02:23:54.400
Because I'm pissed off that she has to do it.

02:23:54.400 --> 02:23:57.920
I've come up with interesting titles for her papers, including Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans.

02:24:00.320 --> 02:24:05.520
And, um, my, uh, suggestion to her for the summary of her essay is in summary, fuck you.

02:24:06.560 --> 02:24:06.960
Just saying.

02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:09.600
Logie?

02:24:09.600 --> 02:24:15.760
Fucking to myself for letting my backyard get so overgrown that I can only, like, not

02:24:15.760 --> 02:24:16.480
even really mow.

02:24:16.480 --> 02:24:25.280
I should say hack through with, uh, a mower, you know, weed whacker and various other tools.

02:24:25.280 --> 02:24:30.880
I can only get about most of my side yard done before I filled up two trash cans full

02:24:30.880 --> 02:24:33.040
of grass and vines.

02:24:33.680 --> 02:24:34.800
It is a jungle out there.

02:24:36.640 --> 02:24:40.320
Um, I'm going to give an FU to the fact that here we are trying to do our last show on

02:24:40.320 --> 02:24:43.360
all games and there isn't an all game server tonight, but whatever.

02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:44.560
These things happen.

02:24:44.560 --> 02:24:47.920
It's just always seems to happen at key times.

02:24:47.920 --> 02:24:52.320
Um, but I will, um, say, you know, I'm going to say a thank you for the listener that says

02:24:52.320 --> 02:24:52.880
we don't do enough.

02:24:52.880 --> 02:24:53.840
Thank you is during the FUs.

02:24:53.840 --> 02:25:01.120
I'm going to say a thank you to all of the folks, live listeners, um, for being really

02:25:01.120 --> 02:25:04.160
understanding in light of the difficult announcement we made tonight.

02:25:04.160 --> 02:25:09.200
I feel a lot of love and a lot of support, and that wasn't an easy thing that, you know,

02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:11.920
we, we've had to keep it under wraps for a long time.

02:25:11.920 --> 02:25:14.480
And you know, there's a sense of guilt that comes with that.

02:25:14.480 --> 02:25:17.120
Um, but thank you guys for understanding.

02:25:17.120 --> 02:25:18.560
It's, it's, um, awesome.

02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:19.680
You guys are great.

02:25:19.680 --> 02:25:23.440
And next week, hopefully our, our new server won't go down.

02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:24.800
We'll see.

02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:27.280
Anyway, uh, that's it for FUs.

02:25:27.280 --> 02:25:32.160
Let's get into a few more stories and then Twitter topics at twitter.com slash O L R.

02:25:32.160 --> 02:25:34.000
Uh, just a few of those Skypline.

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:35.520
We've got to do Skypline as well.

02:25:35.520 --> 02:25:37.520
Um, so let's try to run through these last few stories.

02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:40.160
So we have time for a couple of Skype calls cause I know people want to get in tonight.

02:25:41.040 --> 02:25:41.360
Okay.

02:25:41.360 --> 02:25:47.120
So Nintendo has made a patent for game emulation on low capacity systems.

02:25:47.680 --> 02:25:53.040
Basically, um, some sort of device that, you know, they have, it looks like in an airplane

02:25:53.040 --> 02:25:57.920
or something like that, where somebody is playing, uh, some sort of game or something

02:25:57.920 --> 02:25:58.960
on the back of a chair.

02:25:58.960 --> 02:26:03.840
So basically like an arm device or something like that, that would emulate Game Boy, Game

02:26:03.840 --> 02:26:08.720
Boy Color, Game Boy Advance games, um, systems like cell phones and stuff like that.

02:26:08.720 --> 02:26:14.560
Funny because that already exists, you know, as emulators on said pretty much every platform

02:26:14.560 --> 02:26:18.800
known man, but now they're making it official, I guess that they're going to do some sort

02:26:18.800 --> 02:26:24.880
of emulators, which points more towards, you know, you know, having some sort of software

02:26:24.880 --> 02:26:29.920
that runs on those, you know, buy all the old shit all over again, of course played

02:26:29.920 --> 02:26:31.840
in it.

02:26:31.840 --> 02:26:35.600
I like how they're all, you can play them in the back of like airplane seats or on my

02:26:35.600 --> 02:26:40.400
phone that I have or my game device or my tablet or what about, you know, whatever else

02:26:40.400 --> 02:26:42.000
because they have emulators for everything.

02:26:43.440 --> 02:26:44.000
Computer.

02:26:45.840 --> 02:26:46.240
All right.

02:26:46.240 --> 02:26:52.000
Um, LOL lawsuits, Ubisoft and game trailers were sued this week over Assassin's Creed.

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:55.440
There's for that email earlier and Assassin's Creed copyright.

02:26:55.440 --> 02:27:03.200
Apparently Assassin's Creed stole core ideas from, um, John Bestwinger's novel Link.

02:27:03.200 --> 02:27:08.960
Link was published in 20 or excuse me, 2002 Assassin's Creed first came out in 2007.

02:27:08.960 --> 02:27:09.840
Now, yes, that's right.

02:27:09.840 --> 02:27:13.920
I said he's suing Ubisoft and game trailers now.

02:27:13.920 --> 02:27:14.240
Okay.

02:27:14.240 --> 02:27:17.760
If you think somebody bit off your game, I get the Ubisoft lawsuit, right?

02:27:17.760 --> 02:27:23.200
They, they publish the game and okay, I get that because apparently in the novel link,

02:27:24.960 --> 02:27:30.400
his novel discusses assassinations and has spiritual and biblical tones similar to those

02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:31.760
in Assassin's Creed.

02:27:31.760 --> 02:27:38.000
There's also a battle between good and evil that was stolen right out of every other book.

02:27:39.440 --> 02:27:46.240
Apparently the link device is where users access ancestral memories and relive specific

02:27:46.240 --> 02:27:50.560
moments in history, much as the animus in Assassin's Creed does.

02:27:51.520 --> 02:27:52.800
I've never heard that plot.

02:27:52.800 --> 02:27:56.720
I came out with a book with fantasy characters and there's elves in it.

02:27:56.720 --> 02:28:00.400
I want my money, but this is great.

02:28:00.400 --> 02:28:02.160
By the estate of Tolkien will sue you.

02:28:02.160 --> 02:28:08.960
The guy is suing game trailers because of the trailers that infringe on the copyright.

02:28:09.680 --> 02:28:13.840
So just for hosting the trailer to Ubisoft's game, game trailers has been looped down.

02:28:13.840 --> 02:28:14.400
They're not good.

02:28:14.400 --> 02:28:16.160
And that's where this thing went from.

02:28:16.160 --> 02:28:18.560
Okay, well maybe too fucking absurd.

02:28:20.080 --> 02:28:23.200
Like what kind of 1-800 lawyers representing you here?

02:28:23.200 --> 02:28:26.080
5.25 million dollars in damages.

02:28:26.080 --> 02:28:29.840
Cessation of further copyright infringement.

02:28:30.880 --> 02:28:34.160
The fact you're suing game trailers says you have no idea how the internet works.

02:28:34.160 --> 02:28:34.560
Goodbye.

02:28:36.080 --> 02:28:38.560
Are we going to get sued for mentioning it on the show?

02:28:38.560 --> 02:28:39.440
Oh, Freedom of Press.

02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:40.160
Nope, can't do that.

02:28:40.960 --> 02:28:41.680
Commentary.

02:28:42.880 --> 02:28:44.000
Anyhow, Dark Soccer.

02:28:45.200 --> 02:28:50.640
Well, there is going to be Silent Hill Revelation 3D.

02:28:50.640 --> 02:28:51.200
Yay!

02:28:51.200 --> 02:28:52.720
And it's going to be in the theaters.

02:28:52.720 --> 02:28:53.220
Yay!

02:28:53.220 --> 02:28:56.900
October 26th, which is my brother's birthday.

02:28:56.900 --> 02:28:57.460
Just saying.

02:28:58.740 --> 02:29:01.140
I am so excited.

02:29:02.340 --> 02:29:05.860
But it will have Sean Bean and Carrie Ann Moss.

02:29:06.660 --> 02:29:09.460
And it will sort of follow Silent Hill 3.

02:29:10.420 --> 02:29:14.180
Just that it's got Heather Mason in it and their stuff.

02:29:14.180 --> 02:29:16.740
I find it fascinating it's most of the same cast from the first movie.

02:29:16.740 --> 02:29:19.060
That's great that they were able to get them all to come back.

02:29:19.060 --> 02:29:19.940
Yeah, I think that's cool.

02:29:19.940 --> 02:29:21.700
Will Sean Bean die because he dies and everything?

02:29:21.700 --> 02:29:23.700
I was just going to say that.

02:29:23.700 --> 02:29:24.340
Oh, sorry.

02:29:25.780 --> 02:29:26.500
But, um...

02:29:26.500 --> 02:29:27.300
Don't sue me.

02:29:27.300 --> 02:29:30.660
But apparently it's going to have, um, Akira Yamaoka's music again.

02:29:31.860 --> 02:29:34.100
And, uh, I'm excited.

02:29:34.100 --> 02:29:35.700
I am super, super excited.

02:29:35.700 --> 02:29:40.180
But it doesn't say who, uh, it means I'm going to have to go on the wiki now to see, um,

02:29:40.180 --> 02:29:43.060
who actually directed it because I don't think it's, uh, Gons this time.

02:29:46.340 --> 02:29:48.020
DJ Morpheus in the chat room.

02:29:48.020 --> 02:29:52.500
Ann Rice came up with Overly Gay Vampires first, but no suit against Twilight.

02:29:53.780 --> 02:29:54.820
Okay, I'm on the IMDB.

02:29:54.820 --> 02:29:56.500
I should be offended, but I'm totally not.

02:29:56.500 --> 02:29:57.060
That's great.

02:29:57.060 --> 02:29:58.660
Okay, I'm on the, uh, IMDB.

02:29:59.860 --> 02:30:02.740
And, uh, it said, God, no, it won't load.

02:30:02.740 --> 02:30:03.540
Okay.

02:30:03.540 --> 02:30:05.780
Does this mean, does this mean OLR field trip?

02:30:05.780 --> 02:30:06.100
Yes.

02:30:06.100 --> 02:30:06.580
To the movies?

02:30:06.580 --> 02:30:08.180
OLR Night at the Movies movie date?

02:30:08.180 --> 02:30:09.300
Michael J. Bassett.

02:30:09.300 --> 02:30:11.300
Will Dark Soccer and I share a popcorn?

02:30:11.300 --> 02:30:12.260
I don't need popcorn.

02:30:13.140 --> 02:30:14.100
I don't need corn!

02:30:14.100 --> 02:30:17.940
Well, Loki and I share popcorn.

02:30:17.940 --> 02:30:18.820
You and I, we can share.

02:30:18.820 --> 02:30:20.420
No, I'm not sharing.

02:30:20.420 --> 02:30:23.380
Rob Junior Mintz.

02:30:23.380 --> 02:30:25.780
All right, we'll share Junior Mintz.

02:30:25.780 --> 02:30:29.140
I just want an excuse to put my hand in the box at the same time we hold hands.

02:30:29.700 --> 02:30:34.500
Oh, but it's directed and written by Michael J. Bassett and another person.

02:30:34.500 --> 02:30:37.460
This is Kit Harrington, who I have no idea who that is.

02:30:38.500 --> 02:30:42.260
Some dude whose mom's name is Deborah.

02:30:42.260 --> 02:30:44.740
Oh, he's, he's in Game of Thrones.

02:30:44.740 --> 02:30:46.340
No wonder, cause I don't watch that stupid show.

02:30:46.980 --> 02:30:49.460
What's, um, I'm not going to go into it.

02:30:49.460 --> 02:30:52.420
I just, I happen to know a lot of people really love that show.

02:30:52.420 --> 02:30:52.900
I haven't watched it.

02:30:52.900 --> 02:30:55.540
I'm going to say what I've told lots of people.

02:30:55.540 --> 02:30:57.940
I don't give a shit if you like it.

02:30:58.500 --> 02:31:00.180
Don't tell me how good it is.

02:31:00.180 --> 02:31:01.060
I don't care.

02:31:01.620 --> 02:31:02.660
It says nothing.

02:31:02.660 --> 02:31:04.100
It's a really good series.

02:31:04.660 --> 02:31:05.300
Fuck off.

02:31:05.300 --> 02:31:06.420
Dan likes it.

02:31:06.420 --> 02:31:08.980
And this is what I, this is what I have to say.

02:31:08.980 --> 02:31:13.860
I have to say, just because I don't like something that you like, doesn't mean I'm making a statement

02:31:13.860 --> 02:31:15.540
about you don't take it personally.

02:31:15.540 --> 02:31:17.060
Or that it's bad necessarily.

02:31:17.700 --> 02:31:20.020
Yeah, it's just not something I'm into.

02:31:20.020 --> 02:31:22.580
And it has nothing to do with my opinion of you.

02:31:23.140 --> 02:31:28.420
If I know that you like it, then I will be quiet and not, you know, shit talk it in front of you

02:31:28.420 --> 02:31:30.260
out of respect for my friendship with you.

02:31:30.260 --> 02:31:32.660
But if I don't like it, I'm not going to hide that I don't like it.

02:31:32.660 --> 02:31:35.620
A lot of people might think Supernatural is the dumbest thing on TV.

02:31:35.620 --> 02:31:36.820
And they're entitled to that.

02:31:36.820 --> 02:31:37.460
Don't tell me.

02:31:37.460 --> 02:31:39.140
I don't care.

02:31:39.140 --> 02:31:41.860
All right, moving on.

02:31:43.620 --> 02:31:46.340
You know how it is when you say, oh, I kind of don't like this.

02:31:46.340 --> 02:31:47.540
And everyone jumps on you.

02:31:47.540 --> 02:31:48.260
Why don't you like it?

02:31:48.260 --> 02:31:49.060
It's the best thing ever.

02:31:50.180 --> 02:31:51.780
I'm offended that you don't like it.

02:31:51.780 --> 02:31:54.500
That's how I feel when people tell me they don't like RuPaul's Drag Race.

02:31:54.500 --> 02:31:58.340
It's like, okay, hate on Ru all you want because Fifi O'Hara is in the final three.

02:31:58.340 --> 02:32:00.740
But seriously, it's the best fucking show on TV.

02:32:00.740 --> 02:32:01.140
Shut up.

02:32:02.020 --> 02:32:03.140
But you know what I mean?

02:32:03.140 --> 02:32:08.100
When people take their shit personally, and it's not something to do personally.

02:32:09.780 --> 02:32:11.700
Black Wolf says I take it personally.

02:32:11.700 --> 02:32:14.340
Legend of Zaku says King Joffrey will have Jamie's head.

02:32:17.140 --> 02:32:19.620
What, after he gets stabbed sitting on his chair of swords?

02:32:20.260 --> 02:32:20.900
I don't know.

02:32:20.900 --> 02:32:21.540
I don't care.

02:32:21.540 --> 02:32:23.060
That's what I call it behind everyone's back.

02:32:23.060 --> 02:32:23.860
A chair of swords.

02:32:24.580 --> 02:32:25.140
Right.

02:32:25.140 --> 02:32:26.740
Moving on so we can get to calls.

02:32:26.740 --> 02:32:27.240
Loki.

02:32:27.240 --> 02:32:34.360
So, thank you Sega for thinking outside the box with your toilet games.

02:32:34.360 --> 02:32:38.440
And now this Super Monkey Ball for the Vita.

02:32:38.440 --> 02:32:39.640
It's already out in Japan.

02:32:39.640 --> 02:32:45.240
And for a limited time, Sega is offering adult map download codes for those who purchase the game.

02:32:45.800 --> 02:32:49.240
And what exactly is that, you may ask?

02:32:49.240 --> 02:32:59.160
Well, it is featuring Bikini Model, Yuki Kamamura, and well, you have to roll over her breasts

02:32:59.160 --> 02:33:02.520
that protrude all over the place on the map.

02:33:03.080 --> 02:33:06.600
Yes, it's like those wonderful mouse pads that you can buy.

02:33:06.600 --> 02:33:11.160
You must navigate your monkey ball over a field of breasts.

02:33:12.600 --> 02:33:13.160
Well played.

02:33:14.840 --> 02:33:15.480
Well played.

02:33:15.480 --> 02:33:18.200
Boobies.

02:33:21.160 --> 02:33:23.960
I just want to know if it's going to start a new fetish of some type.

02:33:23.960 --> 02:33:24.760
And I worry.

02:33:24.760 --> 02:33:26.280
I worry for the future.

02:33:26.280 --> 02:33:27.400
I think it's awesome.

02:33:27.400 --> 02:33:31.080
Well, actually, if you remember, Super Monkey Ball was supposed to have it where you can

02:33:31.080 --> 02:33:33.080
actually create maps based off a picture.

02:33:33.080 --> 02:33:38.360
So if you took a picture of a banana, it would create a banana shaped map.

02:33:38.360 --> 02:33:40.840
So what is the TTP for that game?

02:33:41.640 --> 02:33:43.640
How long before we have penis shaped maps?

02:33:43.640 --> 02:33:52.280
A half a second, two seconds, a millisecond, a millisecond.

02:33:52.280 --> 02:33:52.840
All right.

02:33:52.840 --> 02:33:55.960
Instants are instantaneous.

02:33:56.840 --> 02:34:01.800
One toa gak in the chat room says, so you move your balls over the boobs?

02:34:02.840 --> 02:34:04.040
Yes, just like that.

02:34:05.400 --> 02:34:06.920
All right, one more story for you guys.

02:34:06.920 --> 02:34:13.080
And guys, we have to end on a good note tonight because this is like a game where you have

02:34:13.080 --> 02:34:15.720
this is like the hero of the gaming industry this week.

02:34:15.720 --> 02:34:16.520
And we have to end.

02:34:16.520 --> 02:34:18.040
You know, we talk a lot of shit.

02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:21.880
You know, we commentate a lot on this and sometimes have a very cynical attitude.

02:34:21.880 --> 02:34:25.640
But this guy deserves a fucking round of applause.

02:34:25.640 --> 02:34:29.000
And we're going to end by tipping our hats to this man tonight.

02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:29.560
Who is it?

02:34:30.440 --> 02:34:32.520
Katsuhiro Harada.

02:34:32.520 --> 02:34:33.320
Do you know that name?

02:34:34.200 --> 02:34:35.960
You would if you're a fan of Tekken.

02:34:35.960 --> 02:34:37.720
He's the Tekken series producer.

02:34:37.720 --> 02:34:38.760
Totally love.

02:34:39.960 --> 02:34:41.880
And why is he our hero this week?

02:34:41.880 --> 02:34:43.720
Because he's a pimp.

02:34:43.720 --> 02:34:47.480
He talked to Edge Online, who apparently has been getting a lot of people this week in

02:34:47.480 --> 02:34:53.960
interviews, and he says, well, he didn't say if you are worried about what Capcom is doing,

02:34:53.960 --> 02:34:55.160
then don't worry about this.

02:34:55.160 --> 02:35:02.200
But he did basically say no Tekken game will ever have DLC characters at all.

02:35:02.200 --> 02:35:10.440
Bravo, bravo, bravo, I tip my hat.

02:35:12.280 --> 02:35:15.240
No Tekken game will ever have DLC characters at all.

02:35:15.240 --> 02:35:17.640
Too bad Tekken 6 was shit, but we forgive you.

02:35:18.520 --> 02:35:22.280
We forgive you and stand by your amazing statement.

02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:30.040
Now, before you get too excited, he did say vanity items might be added to the game after

02:35:30.040 --> 02:35:31.320
the fact and would have a charge.

02:35:31.320 --> 02:35:35.400
Like, you know, alternate costumes and, you know, preorder bonuses for that.

02:35:35.400 --> 02:35:39.080
But no DLC characters, which is good enough for me.

02:35:39.080 --> 02:35:42.200
If people want to play Barbie with their characters and that costs money, then fine.

02:35:42.200 --> 02:35:44.120
But no DLC characters.

02:35:44.120 --> 02:35:44.920
Thank you.

02:35:44.920 --> 02:35:45.560
You know what?

02:35:45.560 --> 02:35:47.160
Make sure Tekken 7 is a good game.

02:35:47.160 --> 02:35:47.960
You know what's funny?

02:35:48.520 --> 02:35:50.680
You're talking about playing Barbies with the characters.

02:35:50.680 --> 02:35:53.160
Dan was really into Dead or Alive beach volleyball.

02:35:53.880 --> 02:35:55.560
And he would be like, look at this outfit.

02:35:55.560 --> 02:35:57.240
And I'm like, oh, you're being such a girl.

02:35:57.960 --> 02:35:58.520
I love it.

02:35:58.520 --> 02:35:59.000
I love it.

02:35:59.000 --> 02:36:01.720
I don't think that's what he was referring to as far as look at this outfit.

02:36:01.720 --> 02:36:04.280
It's more like, look at how small this outfit is.

02:36:06.200 --> 02:36:10.360
It would just be funny to think about how he got these different outfits.

02:36:10.360 --> 02:36:11.000
And I was like, oh.

02:36:12.360 --> 02:36:13.320
Skype line's open.

02:36:13.320 --> 02:36:15.160
1877 game OLR.

02:36:15.160 --> 02:36:17.560
Our username on Skype is orange lounge radio.

02:36:17.560 --> 02:36:18.120
Give us a call.

02:36:18.120 --> 02:36:19.720
We got time for a couple of quick calls tonight.

02:36:19.720 --> 02:36:23.960
We're running a little long due to the earlier announcement that caused Bobby to run long.

02:36:23.960 --> 02:36:26.600
But we will try to squeeze in a few calls here.

02:36:26.600 --> 02:36:30.760
Again, 1877 game OLR, our username on Skype, orange lounge radio.

02:36:30.760 --> 02:36:32.600
In the meantime, let me try to get to some tweets.

02:36:32.600 --> 02:36:38.360
I don't have a whole lot of time, but I'm going to get to these as fast as I can here.

02:36:40.360 --> 02:36:42.920
Dark Tetsuya wants to remind everybody about the hunt.

02:36:44.360 --> 02:36:47.480
Thank you, Dark Tetsuya, for putting that on at orange lounge radio.com.

02:36:47.480 --> 02:36:51.800
I apologize that things have been kind of going to the back burner in spite of everything

02:36:51.800 --> 02:36:55.480
else going on with the announcements and things like that.

02:36:55.480 --> 02:36:57.960
But if you haven't checked it out, it's a fun little competition.

02:36:57.960 --> 02:37:00.920
Dark Tetsuya's trying to get the little scoreboard and get people into it.

02:37:00.920 --> 02:37:01.800
It's really cute.

02:37:01.800 --> 02:37:03.480
Check that out at orange lounge radio.com.

02:37:04.040 --> 02:37:06.360
Piece of advice, don't get eaten by a grue.

02:37:06.360 --> 02:37:09.480
So you can guess where the next challenge is probably going.

02:37:09.480 --> 02:37:10.920
In the meantime, let's go to some calls.

02:37:10.920 --> 02:37:11.960
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:37:11.960 --> 02:37:12.360
Who's this?

02:37:12.920 --> 02:37:13.560
Hey, hey, hey.

02:37:13.560 --> 02:37:14.200
It's Ranma.

02:37:14.200 --> 02:37:14.920
Hey, hey, hey.

02:37:14.920 --> 02:37:15.320
What's up?

02:37:16.200 --> 02:37:17.240
Not a lot.

02:37:17.240 --> 02:37:21.240
A couple of things I wanted to discuss in regards to Paxis because I didn't get a chance

02:37:21.240 --> 02:37:22.200
to all last time.

02:37:22.200 --> 02:37:22.700
Yeah.

02:37:22.700 --> 02:37:25.580
But before that, I just have one thing to say to you, Rob.

02:37:25.580 --> 02:37:26.080
Yep.

02:37:27.820 --> 02:37:31.900
In the time I've listened to the show, you've worked your ass off.

02:37:31.900 --> 02:37:34.140
You've delivered so much.

02:37:34.780 --> 02:37:37.660
So I don't care what you say.

02:37:38.700 --> 02:37:41.340
You earned that diva fit you made.

02:37:41.340 --> 02:37:42.700
You earned that.

02:37:44.780 --> 02:37:49.740
I mean, for what you give back and for that one person to say something for you to fly

02:37:49.740 --> 02:37:51.900
off the handle like that, you earned it.

02:37:51.900 --> 02:37:55.260
This is four-year-old news, Ranma.

02:37:55.260 --> 02:37:57.500
This is, we're over it.

02:37:57.500 --> 02:38:01.020
That'll probably, you know what's funny in light of all the news tonight about all games

02:38:01.020 --> 02:38:05.900
and everything, that'll probably end up being the big highlight of OLR on the All Games

02:38:05.900 --> 02:38:06.400
Network.

02:38:07.180 --> 02:38:10.620
And between me and Misty, one of us has that episode on our hard drives.

02:38:10.620 --> 02:38:11.260
Oh, great.

02:38:12.540 --> 02:38:15.900
Misty's getting a present when she comes out here for the 10-year show, by the way.

02:38:15.900 --> 02:38:16.460
Oh, wow.

02:38:16.460 --> 02:38:17.740
Shit, was I supposed to say that on air?

02:38:17.740 --> 02:38:18.540
Oh, well, oops, I did.

02:38:18.540 --> 02:38:21.260
I found some old episodes.

02:38:22.940 --> 02:38:24.140
So, all right.

02:38:24.940 --> 02:38:28.140
Anyhow, what did you really want to tell us tonight, Ranma, about PAX East?

02:38:28.140 --> 02:38:30.140
Just a couple of quick things.

02:38:30.140 --> 02:38:35.660
One thing was, you know, the portable game, the portable console lounge?

02:38:36.860 --> 02:38:37.360
Yeah.

02:38:37.820 --> 02:38:41.580
And a lounge full of 3DSs, the Vita stands alone.

02:38:42.620 --> 02:38:42.940
Really?

02:38:42.940 --> 02:38:45.500
Like nobody brought Vitas or what happened?

02:38:45.500 --> 02:38:48.620
It was like one or two people with Vitas.

02:38:48.620 --> 02:38:54.220
It was like for every 10 3DSs you saw, you probably saw maybe one person with a Vita.

02:38:54.780 --> 02:38:55.500
You know what, though?

02:38:55.500 --> 02:38:58.940
It's everybody's trying to street pass, and everybody's trying to clear their queue

02:38:58.940 --> 02:39:00.140
for Find Me and everything.

02:39:00.140 --> 02:39:03.820
I gotta say, I got a shit ton of street passes at Disneyland this week when I was there.

02:39:03.820 --> 02:39:09.820
And yeah, I was able to get all the way to the second to last boss and Find Me 2.

02:39:09.820 --> 02:39:14.220
And let me tell you, there's some real bullshit that happens in Find Me 2.

02:39:14.220 --> 02:39:15.820
Can I just say?

02:39:15.820 --> 02:39:17.180
Who are you trying to kid?

02:39:17.180 --> 02:39:17.680
Anyway.

02:39:19.820 --> 02:39:21.420
No, no, I agree with you about Find Me 2.

02:39:21.420 --> 02:39:22.780
I'm like, who are you trying to kid?

02:39:22.780 --> 02:39:24.780
I know, it's kind of getting to the point where it's bullshit.

02:39:24.780 --> 02:39:29.740
But I will say this, I did also finish the Kid Icarus puzzle in the little swap puzzle thing.

02:39:30.460 --> 02:39:33.740
That's a pretty sweet little 3D image that it's like in motion.

02:39:34.700 --> 02:39:37.980
I finished that when I'm still trying to finish up the rest of the puzzles

02:39:37.980 --> 02:39:44.620
as I continue to street pass every single day to and from work.

02:39:44.620 --> 02:39:46.220
There's actually something I was wondering about.

02:39:46.220 --> 02:39:46.700
What's that?

02:39:46.700 --> 02:39:51.980
With the lenticular photos that the 3DS takes, Dan's phone takes lenticular photos as well.

02:39:52.540 --> 02:39:55.340
I wonder if they would be readable by each other's...

02:39:55.340 --> 02:39:56.060
You might.

02:39:56.060 --> 02:39:57.660
See what kind of file format it does.

02:39:57.660 --> 02:39:59.420
See if you can put it on the web especially.

02:39:59.420 --> 02:40:03.020
If it can go on the web and then you can see it in the 3DS browser, it might work.

02:40:03.020 --> 02:40:03.660
It probably would.

02:40:04.220 --> 02:40:05.180
It just depends on the full frame.

02:40:05.180 --> 02:40:05.900
It just occurred to me.

02:40:05.900 --> 02:40:07.500
Hmm, play around with that.

02:40:08.620 --> 02:40:10.060
Well, anything else, Rama?

02:40:10.060 --> 02:40:15.100
Well, I was telling Jamie this last night, but as you know,

02:40:15.100 --> 02:40:17.980
the big thing about PAX is the Omega-Thon, right?

02:40:17.980 --> 02:40:18.480
Oh yeah.

02:40:19.180 --> 02:40:23.900
Well, I am proud to say that one of my very good friends, Tina Lamb,

02:40:24.940 --> 02:40:31.020
if I'm not mistaken, first female gamer to make it to the finals of the Omega-Thon.

02:40:31.020 --> 02:40:31.660
Good for her.

02:40:31.660 --> 02:40:32.220
Did she win?

02:40:33.260 --> 02:40:35.100
No, she came in second place.

02:40:35.100 --> 02:40:38.860
I had a feeling because you would have said the first female winner of the Omega-Thon

02:40:38.860 --> 02:40:39.980
if that was the case.

02:40:39.980 --> 02:40:40.780
Yeah, that's too bad.

02:40:41.580 --> 02:40:45.900
Wasn't the last game like some type of old school board game with the pucks?

02:40:47.180 --> 02:40:48.940
That's what I thought I heard somewhere.

02:40:48.940 --> 02:40:53.820
Yeah, and on the ride back from PAX, my Twitter feed was blowing up because

02:40:53.820 --> 02:40:55.260
she goes by the name of Porkbun.

02:40:55.260 --> 02:40:58.700
So we were like, go team Porkbuns, you can do it Porkbuns.

02:40:58.700 --> 02:41:02.860
We were just like going nuts, just rooting for her because we wanted her to win.

02:41:02.860 --> 02:41:05.740
But since she came in second from what I was told,

02:41:06.300 --> 02:41:09.420
her and her partner are coming back next year to compete again.

02:41:10.060 --> 02:41:11.820
Oh, oh, that's right.

02:41:11.820 --> 02:41:13.580
The runner-up always gets to compete again.

02:41:13.580 --> 02:41:14.300
That's right.

02:41:14.300 --> 02:41:15.180
I've heard that before.

02:41:16.700 --> 02:41:17.180
Well, good.

02:41:17.980 --> 02:41:20.220
And I told Jamie last night, I figured she would like,

02:41:20.220 --> 02:41:22.380
she would love to hear an awesome story like that.

02:41:24.380 --> 02:41:26.460
Well, one day, I think that we should interview her.

02:41:26.460 --> 02:41:28.220
One day, maybe Dark Soccer should be in the final.

02:41:28.220 --> 02:41:29.340
Yeah, we'd love to interview her.

02:41:29.340 --> 02:41:29.660
Why not?

02:41:29.660 --> 02:41:30.540
It'd be fun.

02:41:30.540 --> 02:41:31.820
Well, I'll see what I can do.

02:41:31.820 --> 02:41:32.860
Yeah, it'd be great.

02:41:32.860 --> 02:41:33.340
I'd love that.

02:41:34.780 --> 02:41:35.420
All right.

02:41:35.420 --> 02:41:38.140
Well, Rama, I got to let you go because we got a lot of calls trying to come in.

02:41:38.140 --> 02:41:39.340
So I'll talk to you later.

02:41:39.340 --> 02:41:39.900
Okay, buddy.

02:41:39.900 --> 02:41:40.140
All right.

02:41:40.140 --> 02:41:40.940
Take care, bro.

02:41:40.940 --> 02:41:41.980
Stay fabulous.

02:41:41.980 --> 02:41:42.620
Of course.

02:41:43.580 --> 02:41:44.460
All right.

02:41:44.460 --> 02:41:48.380
1-877-GAMO-LR or use your name on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:41:48.380 --> 02:41:50.060
Getting you some tweets real quick here.

02:41:50.700 --> 02:41:52.460
TigerClaw sends us a couple of tweets.

02:41:52.460 --> 02:41:56.060
Sony wants MMO players to meet each other in real life.

02:41:56.060 --> 02:41:56.380
What?

02:41:57.820 --> 02:41:59.020
Because that always goes well.

02:41:59.020 --> 02:41:59.180
Yeah.

02:41:59.180 --> 02:42:00.540
Well, I mean, there's been Blizzcons.

02:42:00.540 --> 02:42:04.220
There's been Final Fantasy XI fan appreciation events or whatever.

02:42:04.220 --> 02:42:05.100
So why not?

02:42:05.100 --> 02:42:06.140
Some other type of thing.

02:42:06.140 --> 02:42:07.820
But it's not what you think.

02:42:07.820 --> 02:42:12.620
Because what this really is, it's a patent that streamlines the process where online

02:42:12.620 --> 02:42:15.580
friends in an MMO can meet up in the real world and become friends.

02:42:17.100 --> 02:42:20.940
I guess the technology is aimed at getting them together at marketing events.

02:42:21.500 --> 02:42:24.700
You get in-game incentives to go to real world events.

02:42:24.700 --> 02:42:30.380
I guess that's kind of what you do with, like, the DS.

02:42:30.380 --> 02:42:32.780
Go to a Starbucks and get the Nintendo Zone or whatever.

02:42:32.780 --> 02:42:33.820
It's just like with Nier.

02:42:33.820 --> 02:42:35.420
That's all they're doing is Nier stuff.

02:42:35.420 --> 02:42:36.540
Oh, that makes sense.

02:42:36.540 --> 02:42:36.940
All right.

02:42:37.580 --> 02:42:38.140
Oh, that is.

02:42:38.140 --> 02:42:39.820
That is kind of like the same thing as Nier.

02:42:39.820 --> 02:42:42.700
I wonder if the Vita could facilitate that transfer.

02:42:43.260 --> 02:42:44.940
Maybe I'm thinking a little highbrow.

02:42:44.940 --> 02:42:45.340
I don't know.

02:42:47.100 --> 02:42:48.140
Let's go to another call.

02:42:48.700 --> 02:42:49.740
Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:42:49.740 --> 02:42:50.300
Who's this?

02:42:50.300 --> 02:42:52.140
Oh, it's Legend of Zaku.

02:42:52.140 --> 02:42:53.420
Hey, Zaku.

02:42:53.420 --> 02:42:54.940
I can see Zaku tonight.

02:42:54.940 --> 02:42:55.740
What is up with this?

02:42:56.620 --> 02:42:59.020
Because I'm on my Mac, my monitor died tonight.

02:42:59.020 --> 02:43:00.860
So yeah, I have a backup.

02:43:00.860 --> 02:43:05.340
I would put you on the Ustream if I knew how, but I wasn't prepared to go video tonight.

02:43:05.340 --> 02:43:06.380
So whatever.

02:43:06.380 --> 02:43:07.260
What's on your mind, buddy?

02:43:08.380 --> 02:43:09.100
Nothing much.

02:43:09.100 --> 02:43:14.780
Just like catching up on gaming and the, you know, HBO going 360 for non-gaming stuff.

02:43:14.780 --> 02:43:16.940
But yeah, mostly League of Legends and Battlefield.

02:43:17.660 --> 02:43:21.660
But yeah, it's been either of those two games.

02:43:21.660 --> 02:43:27.900
And going on what I've seen in PAX, like in the Portable Gaming Lounge, I'm pretty certain,

02:43:27.900 --> 02:43:33.340
I think Adam was right, aside, well, Rama was right in the sense that, yeah, there probably

02:43:33.340 --> 02:43:38.140
was a little bit more of a lopsided towards 3DSs.

02:43:39.020 --> 02:43:43.580
I mean, don't get me wrong, the Vita's pretty good, especially for Lumines.

02:43:43.580 --> 02:43:50.300
But it's like, I would also imagine that not only 3DS would have to, you know, compete

02:43:50.300 --> 02:43:53.740
against the same space as folks with iPhones that I saw over there.

02:43:53.740 --> 02:43:55.820
Nier isn't also quite the same thing.

02:43:55.820 --> 02:43:58.540
Like Nier isn't the same as that 3DS StreetPass.

02:43:58.540 --> 02:44:02.220
And I seriously think a lot of those people were just trying to like, I never get to StreetPass

02:44:02.220 --> 02:44:02.780
with people.

02:44:02.780 --> 02:44:06.700
I have never, ever played Find Me, you know, like, because, you know, a lot of people don't

02:44:06.700 --> 02:44:07.980
take their DSs with them everywhere.

02:44:07.980 --> 02:44:10.620
But a convention like PAX is a great place to do it.

02:44:10.620 --> 02:44:15.100
Even then, there were still folks on their iPads playing, you know, all the other types

02:44:15.100 --> 02:44:21.500
of iPad games, you know, not included, you know, not limited to Angry Birds, but...

02:44:21.500 --> 02:44:24.220
They were just showing off that they had the fancy new ones.

02:44:24.220 --> 02:44:26.540
Yeah, they had their iPads or their tablets.

02:44:27.180 --> 02:44:34.300
But it was pretty much like, obviously, the 3DS was like the only traditional game, portable

02:44:34.300 --> 02:44:37.420
game console that was represented, but everything else was still mobile.

02:44:37.420 --> 02:44:42.540
Like, I even had the chance to break out my, you know, my phone for a bit, but, you know,

02:44:42.540 --> 02:44:44.380
battery was getting there.

02:44:44.380 --> 02:44:50.620
But you get the idea that it's not just 3DS anymore when you have, like, when you have

02:44:50.620 --> 02:44:51.580
mobile, especially...

02:44:52.380 --> 02:44:53.100
I'm trying to remember.

02:44:55.340 --> 02:45:00.540
I think it was, I forgot which one from Nintendo actually said that he actually liked Angry

02:45:00.540 --> 02:45:01.020
Birds.

02:45:02.140 --> 02:45:02.540
I thought...

02:45:03.740 --> 02:45:07.100
I do remember you reading that same quote, something about, you know, like, kind of tipping

02:45:07.100 --> 02:45:09.900
the hats of the competition that angry birds ain't that bad.

02:45:09.900 --> 02:45:14.620
And yet he goes against the wishes of his boss who basically throws it, who basically

02:45:14.620 --> 02:45:18.460
chides Angry Birds for basically going after their bread and butter.

02:45:18.460 --> 02:45:19.660
Yeah, but you know he's played it.

02:45:20.940 --> 02:45:26.860
Yeah, but it's like, I guess Nintendo didn't keep these, you know, I don't know if they're

02:45:26.860 --> 02:45:32.300
keeping their guys on a PR leash, but that's kind of damaging if the official part, the

02:45:32.300 --> 02:45:35.660
official company line is like, we hate casual gamers.

02:45:35.660 --> 02:45:39.500
Anything outside of, we hate casual developers.

02:45:39.500 --> 02:45:44.220
The guys who, you know, work, you know, the guys who create Angry Birds or any other...

02:45:44.220 --> 02:45:46.460
I don't think Nintendo hates casual gamers.

02:45:46.460 --> 02:45:49.100
Look at what we just talked about tonight.

02:45:49.100 --> 02:45:51.340
Mario 2, who's that really aimed at?

02:45:51.340 --> 02:45:54.620
You know, it's kind of, it's a hot podge of the casual and the hardcore market.

02:45:54.620 --> 02:45:56.540
It's, you know, the Nintendo fan market.

02:45:56.540 --> 02:46:00.940
It's like that whole platform where people could just, you know, buy like a developer

02:46:00.940 --> 02:46:09.900
license for two, you know, developer, an iPhone developer account for 200 bucks and make an

02:46:09.900 --> 02:46:13.820
app that they sell for two bucks a pop and make like, you know, hundreds of thousands

02:46:13.820 --> 02:46:14.860
in profits.

02:46:14.860 --> 02:46:20.060
Where meanwhile, folks who are doing the same for 3DS have to go through the licensing fees

02:46:20.060 --> 02:46:22.860
and they're lucky to even, you know, to break even.

02:46:22.860 --> 02:46:26.940
I guess my point is that with these platforms that have very little overhead, it's a lot

02:46:26.940 --> 02:46:32.220
easier to create breakout hits for audiences that Nintendo may or may not pick up due to

02:46:32.220 --> 02:46:35.180
the, due to them not taking that many risks.

02:46:35.180 --> 02:46:41.580
I cannot, you know, go back to the fact that I hate to say this, but most of the Japanese

02:46:41.580 --> 02:46:44.460
developers are not that much of a risk taker.

02:46:44.460 --> 02:46:44.780
Whereas...

02:46:44.780 --> 02:46:45.340
That is true.

02:46:45.340 --> 02:46:46.860
What did we just talk about with Konami?

02:46:46.860 --> 02:46:47.500
Absolutely.

02:46:48.300 --> 02:46:53.580
I mean, whereas the Western counterparts, at least they understand that if they don't

02:46:53.580 --> 02:46:58.140
innovate or they don't take risks, they're pretty much, they're dead in the water.

02:46:58.140 --> 02:47:00.860
And some have, some have lost big, unfortunately.

02:47:00.860 --> 02:47:03.420
And that's why we hear about these studio closures and so on.

02:47:03.420 --> 02:47:06.940
Sako, I got to let you go so we can get some more calls, but I'm glad you had a good time

02:47:06.940 --> 02:47:07.500
PAX East.

02:47:07.500 --> 02:47:08.540
We'll hopefully see you next year.

02:47:09.100 --> 02:47:09.820
Definitely.

02:47:09.820 --> 02:47:10.380
Later, buddy.

02:47:11.740 --> 02:47:13.420
That's always fun to get video.

02:47:13.420 --> 02:47:14.620
1877 game.

02:47:14.620 --> 02:47:17.820
Well, you know, I have an option on here to answer with video on Skype, but they would

02:47:17.820 --> 02:47:20.140
just see our little chuzzles that we're showing on Ustream.

02:47:20.940 --> 02:47:22.300
I don't want to break Ustream either.

02:47:22.300 --> 02:47:23.420
So, all right.

02:47:23.420 --> 02:47:24.700
Anyhow, 1877 game.

02:47:24.700 --> 02:47:27.100
OLR username is coming in, but there's a call coming in right now.

02:47:27.100 --> 02:47:28.300
So let me go to it.

02:47:28.300 --> 02:47:29.420
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:47:29.420 --> 02:47:29.980
Who's this?

02:47:29.980 --> 02:47:30.780
Sold.

02:47:30.780 --> 02:47:31.580
Oh, thank God.

02:47:31.580 --> 02:47:32.140
It's Porkchop.

02:47:32.140 --> 02:47:32.940
How you doing?

02:47:32.940 --> 02:47:33.900
Hey, Porkchop.

02:47:33.900 --> 02:47:34.700
What is up?

02:47:34.700 --> 02:47:36.620
Yeah, I've been trying to get through all night.

02:47:36.620 --> 02:47:40.540
I lost the shoutcast feed, so I have to switch between Ustream.

02:47:40.540 --> 02:47:42.220
I'm doing everything on my Android.

02:47:42.220 --> 02:47:44.860
So it's good to finally actually get through and start talking.

02:47:44.860 --> 02:47:45.340
So...

02:47:45.340 --> 02:47:48.300
Yeah, what happened wasn't ideal, unfortunately, but it is what it is.

02:47:48.300 --> 02:47:49.100
We all, but...

02:47:49.100 --> 02:47:52.700
Yeah, I know you guys are having the night from hell and it's supposed to be really nice

02:47:52.700 --> 02:47:54.540
since you're kind of moving on and that kind of thing.

02:47:54.540 --> 02:47:56.540
So it's got to be a pain in the ass.

02:47:56.540 --> 02:47:57.900
Yeah, it is what it is.

02:47:57.900 --> 02:48:01.980
You know, the beautiful thing is, you know, we still have a fair amount of people connected

02:48:01.980 --> 02:48:02.780
to the Ustream.

02:48:02.780 --> 02:48:06.140
You know, it might not be quite as many as are usually there on all games, but we have

02:48:06.140 --> 02:48:08.860
a pretty fair amount, you know, connected right now.

02:48:08.860 --> 02:48:13.420
And that just shows that even in a night, our listeners are so awesome that they would

02:48:13.420 --> 02:48:16.220
just like follow us to, oh shit, the stream, go to Ustream?

02:48:16.220 --> 02:48:17.100
All right, we're there.

02:48:17.100 --> 02:48:21.500
And look at you, you're like juggling your Android and you're trying to go to Ustream

02:48:21.500 --> 02:48:23.180
back and forth just so you can call.

02:48:23.180 --> 02:48:23.740
It's great.

02:48:23.740 --> 02:48:25.900
And it's not the case tonight, it's the morning.

02:48:25.900 --> 02:48:27.260
It's like five o'clock here.

02:48:27.260 --> 02:48:31.340
I have a lot to do tomorrow, but I decided to, you know, dedicate it at this stage.

02:48:31.340 --> 02:48:33.100
I really enjoy the station, so...

02:48:33.100 --> 02:48:34.380
You guys are dedicated.

02:48:34.380 --> 02:48:35.580
Yeah, why not?

02:48:35.580 --> 02:48:38.780
I wish I could tell you that the show was going to be on earlier in the future, but

02:48:38.780 --> 02:48:40.220
that's not the case, I'm sorry to say.

02:48:40.780 --> 02:48:41.500
I don't care.

02:48:41.500 --> 02:48:41.980
I love it.

02:48:41.980 --> 02:48:42.860
I'm still listening.

02:48:42.860 --> 02:48:48.540
And I actually wanted to say that, you know, I was going to ask, what was so bad about

02:48:48.540 --> 02:48:49.260
Tekken 6?

02:48:49.260 --> 02:48:51.100
I mean, it wasn't all that bad of a game.

02:48:51.100 --> 02:48:54.380
Apart from the whole, it's been chopped and changed a bit.

02:48:54.380 --> 02:48:58.540
I can understand that you don't have, you know, go get your characters anymore.

02:48:58.540 --> 02:48:59.740
But I actually enjoyed it.

02:48:59.740 --> 02:49:04.300
I'm just wondering, and I know Dark Sakura, you make a good point in saying, you know,

02:49:04.300 --> 02:49:06.700
oh, jump on it if people kind of make a thing about it.

02:49:06.700 --> 02:49:07.740
I'm not being like that.

02:49:07.740 --> 02:49:12.060
I'm just wondering what you thought was actually, could have been better about it, I guess.

02:49:12.060 --> 02:49:16.540
If, to be fair, I may not have given it the best chance, to be fair, because Alan and

02:49:16.540 --> 02:49:18.780
I rented it from, you know, one of the online games.

02:49:18.780 --> 02:49:19.820
Come here, Alan.

02:49:19.820 --> 02:49:21.100
What didn't we like about Tekken 6?

02:49:21.100 --> 02:49:24.140
We tried to play it one night because Alan's like a Tekken fan.

02:49:24.140 --> 02:49:27.820
I've always been a little more into the Capcom games, but as of late, I'm about ready to

02:49:27.820 --> 02:49:28.540
jump ship.

02:49:28.540 --> 02:49:32.540
But we were just kind of playing it going, this game's kind of, we're not, like, we're

02:49:32.540 --> 02:49:33.660
just not into it.

02:49:33.660 --> 02:49:34.860
Like, I don't know what it is.

02:49:34.860 --> 02:49:35.980
Alan, do you, can you explain?

02:49:36.860 --> 02:49:40.460
Yeah, we did story mode or whatever for, with a few characters.

02:49:40.460 --> 02:49:44.220
And it's like, we didn't really recognize the roster.

02:49:44.220 --> 02:49:46.540
And there were a lot of characters, but no one felt interesting.

02:49:46.540 --> 02:49:50.300
And we played story mode a few times and beat the end boss.

02:49:50.300 --> 02:49:52.140
And it's like, this isn't really compelling us.

02:49:53.580 --> 02:49:55.260
It's kind of, I don't know, average.

02:49:56.140 --> 02:49:56.620
It's that-

02:49:56.620 --> 02:49:58.220
I can kind of see where you're coming from.

02:49:58.220 --> 02:50:02.380
I mean, first and sole caliber, to be honest, because you play that in, like, a few hours

02:50:02.380 --> 02:50:02.880
you've done.

02:50:03.420 --> 02:50:06.140
But I mean, the arena mode is very lacking.

02:50:06.140 --> 02:50:09.580
You just go into scenario, you play through with these guys.

02:50:09.580 --> 02:50:14.460
And even though they're already in the fucking other modes, like, you can just play straight

02:50:14.460 --> 02:50:17.260
away, it still gives you the option to go get them.

02:50:17.260 --> 02:50:19.660
And then you can play through, oh, you can get the random movie.

02:50:19.660 --> 02:50:24.380
But again, you can just play a load of matches until you actually get those.

02:50:24.380 --> 02:50:28.460
Like, 10, every 10 matches you got, like, an ending or a scenario movie, whatever.

02:50:28.460 --> 02:50:30.700
I think you make some good points.

02:50:30.700 --> 02:50:34.620
But as a big Tekken fan, I mean, graphically, it was great.

02:50:34.620 --> 02:50:37.660
And they kind of introduced some weird characters.

02:50:37.660 --> 02:50:39.820
But I mean, I think they did okay with it.

02:50:39.820 --> 02:50:41.900
And Tekken 7, yeah.

02:50:41.900 --> 02:50:44.620
I mean, and I'm a fan of Capcom, don't get me wrong.

02:50:44.620 --> 02:50:46.860
I like their games, I love their games.

02:50:46.860 --> 02:50:49.580
But, you know, let's hope they get better.

02:50:49.580 --> 02:50:52.460
And as for the DLC, that's great news as well.

02:50:52.460 --> 02:50:56.700
I will say this, I am super curious, especially in light of the DLC news.

02:50:56.700 --> 02:50:58.540
You know, we did get Street Fighter X Tekken.

02:50:58.540 --> 02:51:02.140
But remember, they're supposed to be a Tekken X Street Fighter as a part of this.

02:51:02.140 --> 02:51:03.900
Namco is going to get their chance, too.

02:51:03.900 --> 02:51:07.340
So I'm really freaking curious.

02:51:07.340 --> 02:51:11.580
Like, I kind of hope that's one of the things that's coming out at E3 this year.

02:51:11.580 --> 02:51:15.740
Uh, you know, to get the first look at is the Tekken X Street Fighter.

02:51:15.740 --> 02:51:17.580
What is the other half going to look like?

02:51:17.580 --> 02:51:18.140
Because remember...

02:51:18.140 --> 02:51:19.740
Yeah, I lost. Sorry, go ahead.

02:51:19.740 --> 02:51:23.900
No, I was just going to say, there was always Capcom versus SNK was a huge, huge, huge game.

02:51:23.900 --> 02:51:26.700
Well, there was also SNK versus Capcom that wasn't bad.

02:51:26.700 --> 02:51:30.220
It just didn't quite get that same, you know, didn't catch on.

02:51:30.220 --> 02:51:31.180
I wasn't a big fan.

02:51:31.180 --> 02:51:35.420
I like the Capcom SNK games, but the other one, that's vckos, wasn't it?

02:51:35.420 --> 02:51:37.820
Yeah. Oh yeah, as vckos. That's right. Yeah, yeah.

02:51:37.820 --> 02:51:39.820
Yeah, that was, I didn't really like the look of it.

02:51:39.820 --> 02:51:43.420
It looked very, you know, I was kind of like, you know, let's push the envelope.

02:51:43.420 --> 02:51:44.940
Yeah, but it didn't look great.

02:51:44.940 --> 02:51:47.900
I didn't really, you know, fall into that side of it.

02:51:49.100 --> 02:51:51.020
Again, I had a point to make. I can't remember.

02:51:51.020 --> 02:51:52.140
But anyway, yeah.

02:51:52.140 --> 02:51:57.900
Well, let's hope that, I mean, I saw the box art for Tekken X Street Fighter, whatever it was.

02:51:57.900 --> 02:52:00.060
Um, I think it's going to be a pretty cool game.

02:52:00.060 --> 02:52:03.740
While in our chatroom, let's hope they don't fuck up like Capcom did.

02:52:03.740 --> 02:52:06.780
Leave the shit on the disc, you know, hackers gonna hack and all that.

02:52:06.780 --> 02:52:07.980
Yes, sir.

02:52:07.980 --> 02:52:11.500
Wylund in our chatroom says Tekken X Street Fighter is 10% complete. Wow.

02:52:12.620 --> 02:52:13.420
Got a ways to go.

02:52:13.420 --> 02:52:17.660
By the way, I would like to point out that my personal favorite in the Tekken series was Tekken 3.

02:52:17.660 --> 02:52:18.700
Me too. Absolutely.

02:52:19.740 --> 02:52:22.060
Absolutely. Yeah, Yoshimitsu never looked cooler.

02:52:22.060 --> 02:52:25.900
So he stuck through there to the next game, Street Fighter X Tekken.

02:52:25.900 --> 02:52:27.820
I think he looks the same as far as I remember.

02:52:27.820 --> 02:52:30.540
I used, I'm sorry, go ahead.

02:52:30.540 --> 02:52:36.140
I used Jin and they changed his moves as of Tekken 4, which he had like my favorite

02:52:36.140 --> 02:52:39.820
Jun moves and all the rest were Kazuya moves and I was in love.

02:52:39.820 --> 02:52:40.780
But yeah.

02:52:40.780 --> 02:52:45.420
I actually like both. I mean, I think it's cool that, you know, because Kazuya was in

02:52:45.420 --> 02:52:49.100
quotation marks dead, you know, that they actually stuck Jin in and said, okay, well,

02:52:49.100 --> 02:52:54.700
here's his illegitimate son or whatever. But the whole, I hate my dad thing then in Tekken 4.

02:52:55.340 --> 02:52:56.700
Um, yeah, why not?

02:52:56.700 --> 02:52:59.180
I think, I think the karate kind of looks cool when he does it.

02:52:59.180 --> 02:53:02.220
But again, you know, you don't want too many characters with the same moves.

02:53:02.220 --> 02:53:04.780
You got, hey, Hatsune Kazuya, you're pretty much the same.

02:53:05.340 --> 02:53:08.940
Um, yeah, so it's fresh. It's new.

02:53:08.940 --> 02:53:10.540
It worked. I think it worked for me anyway.

02:53:10.540 --> 02:53:12.460
So, I mean, if you like it or not.

02:53:13.340 --> 02:53:16.700
All right. Well, Porkchop, I got to let you go so we can wrap up the show.

02:53:16.700 --> 02:53:18.460
But I appreciate you sharing your perspective.

02:53:18.460 --> 02:53:22.380
There's nothing wrong with a friendly little talk about what games we do and don't like.

02:53:22.380 --> 02:53:23.420
So Porkchop, take care, buddy.

02:53:23.420 --> 02:53:24.700
And thanks again for staying up late.

02:53:24.700 --> 02:53:25.500
Absolutely.

02:53:25.500 --> 02:53:27.420
Keep the dream alive, guys. All the best.

02:53:27.420 --> 02:53:28.300
Take care, buddy.

02:53:28.300 --> 02:53:31.500
I was going to say that the reason why it's only 10% done is because they're working on,

02:53:31.500 --> 02:53:34.140
you know, Tekken Tag 2 right now.

02:53:34.140 --> 02:53:35.580
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

02:53:35.580 --> 02:53:36.780
That's coming up this year.

02:53:36.780 --> 02:53:39.580
Yeah, it's going to come up on multiple consoles this year, isn't it?

02:53:39.580 --> 02:53:40.060
Yeah.

02:53:40.060 --> 02:53:41.260
So, all right.

02:53:41.260 --> 02:53:42.620
Um, let me burn through.

02:53:42.620 --> 02:53:43.740
We're going to close the Skypline.

02:53:43.740 --> 02:53:45.340
I'm sorry to those that didn't get through.

02:53:45.340 --> 02:53:46.380
Uh, very sorry.

02:53:46.380 --> 02:53:47.660
Please consider sending us an email.

02:53:47.660 --> 02:53:49.420
Mailbag at orangelawandtrader.com.

02:53:49.420 --> 02:53:51.580
Again, the show is an ending.

02:53:51.580 --> 02:53:52.860
It's a very important point.

02:53:52.860 --> 02:53:53.740
The show is an ending.

02:53:53.740 --> 02:53:56.940
So we'll have a show just like always next week, especially podcasties.

02:53:56.940 --> 02:54:00.300
If you're listening on the podcast feed, you're going to be like, oh, next week?

02:54:00.860 --> 02:54:04.700
Like, same show, but I'm just hearing some slightly different websites given and some

02:54:04.700 --> 02:54:09.580
different, you know, things that will slowly unravel itself throughout the coming year.

02:54:10.140 --> 02:54:13.100
Anyway, um, back to some tweets.

02:54:13.100 --> 02:54:18.860
Tiger Claw also tweeted us, new Facebook lawsuit highlights trouble with kids and virtual currency.

02:54:18.860 --> 02:54:19.580
Oh, God.

02:54:20.380 --> 02:54:24.780
I can only imagine just that how the kids can just rack up all this money so easily.

02:54:24.780 --> 02:54:26.940
It's kind of sick.

02:54:26.940 --> 02:54:31.420
But yeah, another complaint was filed against Facebook with the US district court.

02:54:31.420 --> 02:54:34.220
According to this link, the tire costs on us at Gama Sutra.

02:54:34.860 --> 02:54:38.380
This isn't the only instance of companies getting in trouble over minors purchasing

02:54:38.380 --> 02:54:39.500
credits for social games.

02:54:40.140 --> 02:54:46.300
A US district judge upheld a handful of claims that Apple distributed free iOS apps that

02:54:46.300 --> 02:54:48.300
trick children into money in app purchases.

02:54:51.660 --> 02:54:54.700
Children are allowed to do Facebook accounts from the age of 13.

02:54:54.700 --> 02:54:58.060
However, if you're under the age of 18, you're supposed to ask for your parents permission

02:54:58.060 --> 02:54:59.740
before buying Facebook credits.

02:55:02.220 --> 02:55:04.220
I'm surprised it's just not shut off altogether.

02:55:04.220 --> 02:55:07.100
Maybe that's considering that you had to put your credit card information in.

02:55:07.100 --> 02:55:09.740
I believe that if you're 13, you don't have a credit card.

02:55:09.740 --> 02:55:11.260
How hard is it to open mom's wallet?

02:55:11.980 --> 02:55:14.220
Well, then that's a problem with fraud.

02:55:15.660 --> 02:55:16.940
And they should throw that kid in jail.

02:55:18.140 --> 02:55:19.260
Throw the kids in jail.

02:55:20.300 --> 02:55:23.020
S.J. 100 Matt says, hey, remember Para Para Paradise?

02:55:23.020 --> 02:55:24.780
Yeah, fuck yeah, I love that game.

02:55:24.780 --> 02:55:27.740
Well, a new Para style arcade machine is coming out soon.

02:55:27.740 --> 02:55:29.980
And yes, it has Gaga.

02:55:29.980 --> 02:55:34.300
Oh, because every, every freaking music game these days has to have Gaga.

02:55:34.300 --> 02:55:34.940
Don't get me wrong.

02:55:34.940 --> 02:55:36.220
I love Lady Gaga, but damn.

02:55:36.940 --> 02:55:38.380
Dancecore is the game.

02:55:38.380 --> 02:55:39.260
I guess it's coming out.

02:55:39.260 --> 02:55:42.220
He links us to a little YouTube of somebody playing it.

02:55:42.220 --> 02:55:54.860
It just looks like it's going to be on connect.

02:55:55.660 --> 02:55:57.340
Maybe not in this country, but it'll be connect.

02:55:58.300 --> 02:56:01.580
But they say, yeah, they say in the article, it's more closer to Para Para Paradise

02:56:01.580 --> 02:56:04.220
than it is like DDR or Dance Central or anything like that.

02:56:05.020 --> 02:56:09.420
Or maybe Dance Masters, because that kind of had a lot of power in it.

02:56:09.420 --> 02:56:15.180
But anyway, um, that's really, I think that's going to do it for tweets tonight.

02:56:15.180 --> 02:56:17.740
Thank you guys for sending us tweets, twitter.com slash O L R.

02:56:17.740 --> 02:56:19.020
So we've got to wrap up the show.

02:56:19.020 --> 02:56:21.100
We've got to, um, wrap it.

02:56:21.100 --> 02:56:21.980
Oh, wait, I did.

02:56:21.980 --> 02:56:24.700
I got one last tweet that came in.

02:56:24.700 --> 02:56:27.500
Let me read this one from gamer girl.

02:56:28.220 --> 02:56:30.540
I have a question regarding GLBT.

02:56:31.260 --> 02:56:33.900
I know someone who is bi and they want to come out.

02:56:33.900 --> 02:56:36.380
So to speak, what is the best way to do so?

02:56:36.380 --> 02:56:40.460
Oh, he turned the knob, opened the door.

02:56:40.460 --> 02:56:41.580
Here we go.

02:56:41.580 --> 02:56:47.900
Um, I know there's a lot of, you know, obviously I'm speaking as the gay guy on the show.

02:56:47.900 --> 02:56:51.980
I know there's a lot of society pressures that come with like coming out and all that stuff.

02:56:51.980 --> 02:56:56.060
And sometimes it's one of those things people kind of feel like they kind of have to do

02:56:56.060 --> 02:56:57.660
to get it off their chest.

02:56:57.660 --> 02:57:04.060
I really truly believe a person should not feel like they're forced to do it until they're ready.

02:57:04.060 --> 02:57:07.580
Because taking that first step to really like come out to yourself

02:57:08.140 --> 02:57:11.500
can be one of the hardest things you have to do in that whole process.

02:57:12.140 --> 02:57:18.060
So, you know, don't ever feel any pressure that you do, or you don't have to do anything.

02:57:18.700 --> 02:57:23.580
You know, for your friend, whoever your friend wants to love is their choice.

02:57:23.580 --> 02:57:27.420
Whoever your friend wants to have a relationship with is ultimately their choice.

02:57:27.420 --> 02:57:33.020
You know, that's a private matter that is public when you want it to be public, your friend.

02:57:33.020 --> 02:57:36.620
So, um, they want to come out or whatever.

02:57:36.620 --> 02:57:37.980
What's the best way to do so?

02:57:37.980 --> 02:57:40.860
You're gonna, you need to tell the people that are closest to you.

02:57:40.860 --> 02:57:44.700
True friends are not going to turn the other way.

02:57:45.580 --> 02:57:48.700
Some may kind of say, you know, I'm always kind of suspected,

02:57:48.700 --> 02:57:50.380
but it doesn't really change anything.

02:57:50.380 --> 02:57:54.460
I had the really good fortune that when I came out, everybody was supportive.

02:57:54.460 --> 02:57:57.260
There was very few people that I got into shit with.

02:57:57.260 --> 02:58:00.780
And anybody that was a problem, ain't in my life anymore.

02:58:00.780 --> 02:58:05.100
Bye, you know, but there's been a lot of great people that

02:58:05.100 --> 02:58:07.260
most people I know just don't really care.

02:58:07.820 --> 02:58:09.740
And I think that's, that's fine.

02:58:09.740 --> 02:58:13.740
I will say this that most of my friends that came out and told me, I was usually like, duh.

02:58:16.060 --> 02:58:22.220
Um, the fact that it's bi and not gay can be a really tricky line to walk as well.

02:58:23.100 --> 02:58:26.140
And you know, that could be a lot.

02:58:26.140 --> 02:58:31.260
You know, this could be somebody who's still questioning in a lot of ways and says,

02:58:31.260 --> 02:58:34.860
maybe I'm having these type of tendencies, you know, or whatever.

02:58:34.860 --> 02:58:37.900
All I'm saying, don't ever, don't ever feel like whoever you are,

02:58:37.900 --> 02:58:42.140
you have to pigeonhole yourself into one bucket or another or whatever.

02:58:42.700 --> 02:58:44.780
Just love somebody.

02:58:45.900 --> 02:58:48.460
And you know, my best, preferably yourself first.

02:58:48.460 --> 02:58:49.580
Yeah. Oh yeah, absolutely.

02:58:49.580 --> 02:58:53.820
Starting with yourself, accept yourself and everybody else will come easy.

02:58:53.820 --> 02:58:57.100
That's the best advice I can give. Love yourself first.

02:58:57.660 --> 02:59:00.540
Then those closest to you and your true friends will show their colors.

02:59:00.540 --> 02:59:03.020
Now, now can I say the witty thing?

02:59:03.020 --> 02:59:03.520
Yes.

02:59:04.220 --> 02:59:05.900
For the ones that come easy.

02:59:05.900 --> 02:59:06.860
Some people are easy.

02:59:08.860 --> 02:59:09.360
Stop.

02:59:09.420 --> 02:59:09.920
All right.

02:59:09.980 --> 02:59:11.020
Um, that's it.

02:59:11.020 --> 02:59:11.900
That's it for tweets.

02:59:11.900 --> 02:59:13.980
That's it for Skype calls.

02:59:13.980 --> 02:59:15.100
That's it for the show.

02:59:16.620 --> 02:59:20.060
Thank you guys for staying up late with us on what has been a very interesting

02:59:20.060 --> 02:59:25.580
episode of Orange Lounge Radio and a new chapter starts next week.

02:59:25.580 --> 02:59:28.060
And can't wait to tell you all the details a little later.

02:59:29.420 --> 02:59:33.180
We'll stay tuned to our Twitter feed, twitter.com slash olr, our Facebook,

02:59:33.180 --> 02:59:36.220
facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, our website, of course, orange

02:59:36.220 --> 02:59:37.260
lounge radio.com.

02:59:37.260 --> 02:59:41.180
All the details in the coming days will be on the website.

02:59:42.460 --> 02:59:44.220
That's all I have to say for now on that.

02:59:44.220 --> 02:59:50.460
Anyhow, everything else about the whole situation will be in the podcast

02:59:50.460 --> 02:59:50.700
feed.

02:59:50.700 --> 02:59:53.820
We're going to replay the call that happened with Bobby, and I think

02:59:53.820 --> 02:59:56.460
everything else we have to say on it is all contained in there.

02:59:57.420 --> 03:00:01.580
In the meantime, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

03:00:01.580 --> 03:00:03.260
Loki, your final thoughts tonight.

03:00:03.260 --> 03:00:06.460
This is really strange, but there was this kid, because I took Josh to the

03:00:06.460 --> 03:00:09.580
park today, practicing his unicycle, which begged the question.

03:00:09.580 --> 03:00:15.660
If a bicycle can be shortened to a bike, would a unicycle be a eunuch?

03:00:22.700 --> 03:00:24.300
My final thought is.

03:00:27.500 --> 03:00:31.740
I feel like I felt this weekend that I have a lot of drama in my life

03:00:31.740 --> 03:00:35.260
right now, but I feel really good tonight.

03:00:35.260 --> 03:00:39.100
And I want to thank all you for being a part of that dark soccer, because

03:00:39.100 --> 03:00:40.860
people will shoot me if I don't say it.

03:00:40.860 --> 03:00:42.060
Reject false icons.

03:00:44.060 --> 03:00:45.740
Have a wonderful night, everybody.

03:00:45.740 --> 03:00:46.940
We'll see you next week.

03:00:48.140 --> 03:00:48.620
Somewhere.

03:00:49.180 --> 03:00:49.820
Have a good night.

03:00:50.620 --> 03:00:51.100
Until then.

03:00:51.820 --> 03:00:55.020
