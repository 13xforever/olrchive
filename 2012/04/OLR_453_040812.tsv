9955	26105	Sky, and Loki Tonight, April 8th, 2012 Capcom responds to Better Business Bureau complaints Sex offenders get booted from Xbox Live in one state And our listeners sound off Is EA really the worst company ever?
31621	36524	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36704	38065	Orange Lounge Radio.
38145	45450	We are live for this April the 8th of 2012 with episode number 453 of our show.
46011	48792	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours.
49673	52715	Not with DarkSakura or Jamie Summers, sadly.
52775	53576	She is not here tonight.
53916	57178	She had to make a last minute cancellation tonight because she's not feeling well.
57238	58259	So we hope she feels better.
58299	59740	She's got like a science fiction double feature.
61781	63023	Techmaster Loki is not here tonight.
79238	81920	He's doing Easter stuff with his Jewish wife.
81980	82780	I don't know how that works.
82980	84280	Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
84460	87642	No, it's obviously a holiday for the family.
87742	90003	So they're doing stuff with their kid and all that.
90063	92163	So there's no DarkSakura.
92484	93284	There's no Loki.
93704	95205	But there's me, Rob Roberts.
95685	97485	And obviously you can hear over there.
97686	98466	My loud ass.
99766	100327	Interrupting.
100527	101307	Excuse me, Alan.
101327	104068	I keep forgetting you dropped your handle a couple weeks ago.
104088	105649	It's too mouthy and wordy to say.
105789	106029	All right.
106069	106789	Well, how are you doing, Alan?
106969	107289	I'm good.
107830	109672	I haven't been on the show in a long time.
109732	112956	You haven't, so I'm glad we have an opportunity to have you on again tonight.
113416	119863	For the listeners who haven't heard you, why don't you give us a quick introduction about yourself and the types of games you like and all that.
120537	123058	Mid-30s, been playing since the Atari 2600.
123899	125919	Favorite console is the Super NES.
128200	130041	Right now I'm playing a lot of PC games.
131362	139445	Dragon Age, Oranges, which would be weird, Mass Effect, and so on.
140703	140983	All right.
141323	142644	And we live together, so.
142724	143204	That's right.
144124	146345	So you get to see me all the time.
146465	146685	Yes.
148625	148925	All right.
150406	152186	We have to have a third co-host, obviously.
152587	154387	Orange Entree doesn't work without three co-hosts.
154987	156048	Insert ferret here.
156148	156448	All right.
157268	157968	Say hello, everybody.
158008	163850	Welcome back, by the way, to VXJasonXV, or just Jason, if you will, is back with us tonight.
164913	179248	3 weeks, uh, 3 weeks, quite a bit of turnaround than the 8 years that we were going on about previously I was gonna say, for somebody who lives in Denver, that's really good to be able to get to a show 3 weeks It's like I got home on the train, turned around, took another one, and hey, I'm back!
179729	180850	Which is actually what happened
180970	182271	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
200291	203192	But yeah, I got the job offer Monday night.
203492	208493	I took Tuesday to pack and wrap up things at home and tell my other job, Peace out, guys.
208553	209433	I'm on a train tomorrow.
209473	212274	I'd love to give you two weeks notice, but that's not happening.
213534	216315	So Monday night solidified everything.
216615	220996	Tuesday night, Tuesday in general, finished off everything that I needed to do.
222036	226757	Wednesday morning on the train, and I've been here since just after business hours on Thursday.
227062	227342	DarkSakura.com
242442	248188	So some folks might be wondering, like, well, why, okay, Rob, why would you do a show without DarkSakura and without Loki?
248809	258299	And, you know, well, with no slight to Alan or Jason, who are fine step-in hosts tonight, but, you know, it is a little weird that there's only one of the regular OLR hosts here.
258379	261060	But remember, guys, it is the show where every gamer has a voice.
261500	265081	And it's not necessarily just about me or just about Jamie or just about Loki.
265361	266081	It's about you guys.
266421	271043	So we want to make sure that we would have a show here and a place where you guys can interact and still chat with us.
271383	278645	I have to say, I did take some inspiration a little bit from what's going on over at Video Game Outsiders, which is another show on the All Games Network that I listen to.
279225	285107	And poor John's been holding down the fort over there for a while because his two co-hosts have had just other stuff going on.
285147	286307	But they still do the show every week.
286808	287848	So there's no reason we can't.
288768	291250	We're actually not going to be here next week.
291470	292951	That was a pre-planned thing.
293852	298074	So we knew that Loki would be out tonight, but we thought DarkSakura would be here.
298094	299095	But of course, people get sick.
299155	299655	That happens.
299996	303998	But we knew we would not be here next week, and we didn't want to go two weeks in a row with no show.
304238	308161	So we have the show going tonight, and you guys can chat live with us.
308341	315726	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com And Alpha Cananogram starts us off in the chat room tonight saying, Yay, weird show!
315846	316526	Fuck yes!
317167	317587	Ha ha ha!
319368	321989	More like Broringe Lounge Radio, right?
323409	325390	I don't want you guys to feel like it's the weird show.
325450	328692	I mean, obviously, Jason, you've been our webmaster for years and years.
329352	334174	And you played Bomani games just like DarkSakura, Loki, and I did, just at a different arcade.
334474	337755	So I know you followed that scene probably longer than we did.
339056	340136	But you were in all that stuff.
341417	341677	Alan?
342237	343318	Well, Alan's cool, too.
343338	343718	Right.
346859	349562	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
369623	371468	Alan's coming with me, of course, because he does that.
372050	376605	And we're going to the final ever electronica.
377441	378462	Dude, dude, dude, dude.
402361	404723	Like 18 months or even longer now.
404763	407124	It's probably, yeah, it's been about a year and a half since that movie came out.
407804	420392	But one of the other cool things, and I know we've talked about it on the show before, is that Electronica also has a replica of Flynn's Arcade from the movie with classic 80s video games that are in great condition.
420432	421353	Because, you know, it's Disneyland.
421373	424035	They're not going to let shitty rundown games into their park.
425035	429358	And the one time I have seen a broken machine there, they had a dude out there fixing it in like five seconds.
429858	430018	So...
431079	437828	We're going to go say goodbye to Electronica because they made a business decision to get rid of it because Tron the movie again is a year and a half old now.
439009	449002	We don't know if they're going to be doing a sequel, although there is the anime that's supposed to be out in summer or fall, so it seems weird to me that they're not going to have awareness for that, but they're replacing it with...
449142	450764	with the Mad Tea Party.
451445	457013	And that's tea as in just the letter T, not as in a sippy drink that British people have at lunchtime.
457033	457834	Where's failed trombone?
457854	458455	Do you have it queued up?
458475	459657	No?
459777	461239	I can get failed trombone queued up.
461459	462000	It's too late.
462501	462841	Why are you...
469038	470959	And you're upset about the Mad Tea Party.
471339	472880	Like, you're personally offended, right?
473641	478663	We saw that movie, and I didn't think it was going to be very good, and you were very optimistic.
479183	481945	It'll be okay, it's Tim Burton, and it was shitty.
483526	509440	I didn't like it at all I know some people were into it but no I didn't like it at all but here's the thing and the reason why I bring it up is that unfortunately with Electronica changing over to the Mad Tea Party they're going to close Flynn's Arcade now supposedly the Mad Hatter is supposed to have some type of arcade but I don't believe that means he's keeping the 80s retro games from what I hear they're supposed to be like skeeball and it's it's just it's what
509540	515484	Disney Imagineers, if you want to listen to me for a very awesome idea, you should fix the Bootsy Rundown arcade off of Space Mountain and put
532935	535657	Flynn's Arcade there and it will be super awesome.
535677	536258	Exactly.
536318	537759	And Tomorrowland's a great fit for it.
537979	544745	Or just fucking bulldoze Interventions because who goes in the Interventions building like ever and just make a giant Tron grid.
544765	548388	It would only cost like $11 billion and it would be amazing.
549781	551863	But my hope is, here's my secret hope.
552003	555866	I have a secret wish, hope, pie in the sky idea.
555926	562552	And that is that maybe if we go to the last electronica, they're gonna give away some of the arcade games.
563213	564714	You get an arcade machine.
565074	566375	You get an arcade machine.
566595	568837	Everybody gets an arcade machine.
568957	575301	In reality, that fucking won't happen because I think they're leasing them from a local company that specializes in this shit.
575341	575901	But hold on.
575961	576682	I want my idea.
576742	578883	I want my pie in the sky idea.
579384	581325	And that is that they're going to give away these machines.
581525	590671	So I was thinking about if you could have like a retro arcade machine in your house, what arcade machine would you want to have in your house?
591352	594574	If you could have something from Flynn's Arcade in your house,
595156	596226	What game would you want?
597369	600751	This is a tough one because there's a lot of great games.
601291	604433	Part of me wants to say Dig Dug because I'm actually pretty good at that one.
606834	615079	Part of me wants to say BurgerTime because I damn near bought a... I came so fucking close to buying a BurgerTime machine not even a couple months ago.
615459	620442	And then I realized I live in an apartment and that would be a really shitty idea to bring an arcade machine into the apartment.
620482	623044	But you saw when I saw that BurgerTime machine, Alan, right?
623484	626626	I was like, I could forego getting an iPad and a BurgerTime machine.
626646	626706	Yes.
628345	630026	And you're just rolling your eyes in the back of your head.
630887	638292	But I think the machine I would really, really want to have, I don't know why, it's just, is a spy hunter machine.
640633	646157	Any of the racing games from that era, because they all had different variety of pedals, switches, different steering wheels.
647598	652962	All Points Bulletin was actually one of my favorites from that time period, or at least that's how my brain seems to relate it.
653613	656914	I just have a lot of memories of Spy Hunter as a kid because that's what they had.
657074	657915	Okay, shut up.
658135	659355	It was at the local roller rink.
661036	662957	That's where all the arcade games from my youth came from too.
662977	664177	It was that or the pizza parlor.
664437	665318	You had two choices.
665718	669439	Pizza parlor was like a sit down, either like a joust or a Galaga or something like that.
669519	673481	One of the two-sided top sitting, it's probably a name for that.
673501	674141	I don't know what it is.
674961	676222	Cocktail cabinet.
676662	679224	I want a Spy Hunter machine.
679344	682166	I want Oprah to give me a Spy Hunter machine at the last Electronica.
682826	684447	Jason, what arcade machine would you want?
686849	691792	You know, I had one in mind, and then my brain replaced it with Neo Geo, so I kind of forgot what it was entirely.
694013	699397	Not just Light Cycle Tron, but one of the, I think it was like the movie Tron arcade machines.
699417	700417	Discs of Tron.
700457	701818	There were two Tron machines.
702159	705841	There was Tron, it was just called Tron, and then there was Discs of Tron.
707853	714077	And did that have... I think there's even a third one, because there should have been one that had the assault on the MCP and tanks.
714117	719661	Tron was made up of four minigames, and I think you're just thinking they're all separate games.
719821	722102	Wasn't Tron originally just a Light Cycles game?
722142	722502	Mm-mm.
722823	723783	That's one of the minigames.
723983	725044	It's just the most popular one.
725064	727786	There was the Light Cycle game, there's the MCP Cone, there's the tanks.
729786	734828	I would probably say Discs of Tron just because I would not mind more time with that game.
734848	737608	I've only played it like once or twice and it looked really good.
737668	738549	It was very engaging.
738589	739229	It was really fun.
741209	747391	Alan, if you could steal one machine out of Flynn's Arcade or excuse me, have Oprah give you one, gift you one, what would you want her to give you?
747748	761293	Well, I don't think it's in Flynn's Arcade, but if I had to have a vintage cabinet in my house, it would have to be multiplayer, and it would have to have large cabinets to set drinks on, and I would go with Golden Axe because that game is amazing.
762274	764735	I think Golden Axe is better left in my memory.
765655	778882	Like every time I've played Golden Axe, not to just take a crap on what Alan said, but I just... Not the shitty port that was on Genesis and is currently on XBLA or whatever, but the original arcade Golden Axe with three people is a good time.
779062	780182	It was good memories.
780542	781343	It was good memories.
781943	782923	Goddamn that goblin.
783103	785324	Attack faster, come on!
785825	786985	Awesome comments from our chatroom.
787005	790346	Chat.OrangeLoungeRadio.com because everybody's joining in in the chatroom.
790386	790746	Love this.
791086	795688	DDRDollarBill says, Robotron 2084 would be his game.
797009	798609	Hands bloody fucking down.
799550	801931	Brad from PodCulture, love this answer.
802131	803291	This is one I would want too.
804451	806132	Fucking Star Wars the arcade game.
806192	807233	Good call.
807253	808453	I completely forgot about that.
808633	812216	I'm not even like a Star Wars aficionado and all that.
812296	813997	I mean, I like the movies.
814097	815218	I don't like obsess over them.
815258	816599	I'm more of a Trekkie than a Warsie.
817560	821123	But the arcade game was so fucking good.
821183	822624	Is that the Vectrex one?
822644	822924	Yes.
823505	825506	Did you know there was an Empire Strikes Back of that?
825586	826027	There was.
826387	833913	I don't remember how official it was, but a buddy of mine that has a bunch of arcade machines down in his basement has it on a little...
834582	840126	Rob would scream like a schoolgirl if you won an actual arcade but then he'd be like wait a minute how am I supposed to get this thing out of here?
858900	860521	I would tie it to the roof of my Honda.
860641	861362	I don't even care.
862022	864984	Go driving down by five, catching all the bugs.
866084	867946	Jim Sally says, burger time all the way.
868006	869006	Burger time for the win.
869907	871328	Yeah, I was almost there too.
872248	878612	Stan says, Pac-Man, but the small table version where both players sit at opposite ends of each other.
878792	880073	A cocktail machine.
880653	881254	Cocktail machine.
882374	884495	Oh my god, I'd love to have a cocktail machine.
884515	885756	Those are hard to come by though.
885956	888497	Cocktail machines are really sought after.
888517	894279	Didn't that new Pac-Man game that came out that was incredibly expensive, that's the latest cocktail cabinet?
894379	896260	It was definitely inspired by cocktail machines.
896300	901362	Yeah, I know it's not Pac-Man Championship Edition, but like an arcade, Pac-Man Battle Royale.
901722	902562	I remember it had a funny name.
902702	905823	And it's in Vegas and like New York and nowhere else or something.
906864	908564	My Dave and Buster's in Colorado had it.
909225	909965	It was really fun.
910545	912946	Uh, Ranma says Magic Sword.
913447	914807	Ooh, good fucking call.
914847	915568	I love that one.
916068	919230	That was, that was the one they had at Round Table Pizza that I would just play the shit out of.
919270	921551	Porkchop says APB is awesome.
922551	927694	Um, Brad from PodCulture also says, um, the original Gauntlet would be hella awesome.
927714	929035	There's a good multiplayer game too.
929675	931536	So, good calls all around.
931616	934878	Love the, um, classic arcade game suggestions.
934898	935098	Um,
935478	940179	We're going to be very sad when Electronica closes, but our plan... There's actually a group of us going.
940279	944280	I'm meeting up there with some of my friends from Warcraft.
944640	945060	Nerd, nerd.
945760	949201	Some of my DDR friends from back in the day, Mel and Mel.
949761	954482	Mr. Mel B, who was a big DDR freestyler back in the day, is going with us.
954563	955123	It's going to be good.
955163	960984	And our plan is to, at the end of all of it, yell, end of line, and then collapse into tears.
961504	962284	Drunken tears.
962644	964905	And I want to see Laser Man, because I still haven't seen that shit.
965845	967446	Laser Man will be there from what I understand.
967946	968466	So there you go.
969827	971447	Hey, DarkSakura joined our chat room.
972288	973228	Hello, DarkSakura.
973288	974929	And said Dave and Buster's in Roseville has it.
975209	977050	So if you want to go play Pac-Man Battle Royale, there you go.
977070	978290	Yeah, we haven't been there since that time.
978310	979051	We haven't been there in a while.
979291	986994	Yeah, I think it's one of those things that's going to become a staple of Dave and Buster's because it's not redemption, but it kind of feels like it.
987034	989695	And it's just a quick, engaging game of Pac-Man.
990163	991444	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1008780	1014843	Alright, anyhow, that's enough for our reminiscing and retro arcade games and we will not be here again next week.
1014943	1025289	Our pal Bobby Blackwolf, who we are usually after at All Games Radio, where we do tape live every Sunday night right after his show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, he's been off for the past two weeks.
1025589	1026930	He will be back next week.
1027390	1052201	so at least live folks you have something to look forward to R9 cast of course also live on Sunday nights they will still be doing their thing they've been constant over the past few weeks so there will at least be those shows to look forward to but no OLR we'll try to find a best up from the archives for you live folks maybe a rarity I just came across a stockpile of episodes that aren't even up on the OLR archive so maybe I'll dig one of those up and play that next week it'll be fun
1053223	1053964	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1074381	1100158	I've had the first two games in my Steam account thanks to those crazy sales so I was like I'm gonna play these things and hopefully get to three at some point if I can buy it so two or three weeks ago I beat Mass Effect 1 on both Paragon and Renegade which is sort of goody two-shoes good guy and asshole good guy and now I'm playing Mass Effect 2 and I'm ready to beat it like I just started the end game mission that's all very intense and characters die and
1101238	1102639	I had to save and quit to do the show.
1103899	1106820	So we are literally taking you away from doing Mass Effect right now.
1106900	1107100	Yes.
1107840	1109220	But that's all I've been playing for last week.
1109660	1111121	It's probably good to have a break once in a while.
1111361	1113341	Microphone extension cords and headphones.
1114602	1115682	No, we need him to focus.
1116242	1119663	He needs to be funny because we don't have Loki or DarkSakura tonight.
1119923	1121964	So unless you want to be funny, he has to bring the funny.
1122944	1124085	All right.
1124425	1125065	So that's it for you.
1125105	1126326	Mass Effect, Mass Effect, and more Mass Effect.
1126346	1126906	Now, what are you going to do?
1126926	1127946	Are you going to buy the third game?
1127966	1130568	Are you going to kind of try to play the second one over again?
1130768	1134169	I'm doing my Goody Two Shoes playthrough right now.
1134269	1138051	So once I beat that, then I'll load up my female FemShep.
1138731	1142193	And she's just like, fuck you, fuck you, kill everybody and save the universe.
1142513	1144754	And I don't give a shit because that's how she rolls.
1144974	1146075	That's another 40 or 50 hours of gameplay.
1148656	1154564	DarkSakura sent me her gaming week through proxy and she wants you all to know that she played a shitload of Portal 2 this past week.
1155405	1155946	What a shot.
1156266	1158849	Yet has she touched that copy of Mass Effect I loaned her?
1159210	1159610	No.
1160812	1161252	That's alright.
1161292	1162554	Portal 2 is a pretty kick-ass game.
1163916	1164997	Jason, how was your gaming week?
1165222	1165982	Death Rally Death Rally
1186653	1199885	Jetpack Joyride, and then a couple of silly little things like Sudoku-type games, Picris-type games, and I feel like I'm missing something significant, but considering that consoles weren't really in the mix, I don't think I was.
1201966	1203107	Sometimes you have to game on the go.
1218371	1222235	DarkSakura is yelling at me saying, girl, I'm on my PC unless somebody wants to buy me Mass Effect 1 on Steam.
1241676	1256948	TigerClaw said I bought Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2 for 360 but you may want to wait until BioWare releases the patch that will fix the face import bug which is set to be released next week which is great because I won't get to Mass Effect 3 before next week so I will never have known that that was ever a problem
1257299	1286726	I just had someone on my Facebook a couple hours ago post that they finally beat Mass Effect 3 and of course they've already had the perspective of all the wank about the ending for the last two weeks so I guess if they wanted to be pretentious and rise above that and then they said I have a lot of questions and it's not confusing at all and it's not really wrapped up into a neat little bow but they were satisfied with it so they were like I don't get it I don't get the rage
1286986	1290030	I heard it's one of those endings that makes you madder the more you think about it.
1290410	1294475	So maybe he's not mad today, but next week he'll be raging internet angry.
1294675	1295516	Or 3 a.m.
1296277	1296657	Wait!
1297238	1298219	What?
1298620	1299861	Waking up in a cold sweat.
1299921	1300261	Damn you!
1301873	1312624	Um, I, I have, I'm prepared to be let down by the ending of Mass Effect 3, but just the, the, the adventure from Mass Effect 1 and even, I'm about halfway through Mass Effect 2 right now.
1312644	1318109	2 is so much, well, I don't want to say 2 is so much better because 1 was awesome, but...
1319670	1332141	If the last 20 minutes of the Endgame are shitty for the whole trilogy, that franchise, in my opinion, has given me at least 100 hours of quality, emotional, rewarding gameplay.
1333041	1334583	So it's not a waste of time.
1335223	1356316	and of course there's going to be more DLC some of which obviously will come up a little later in the show when we get to news so let's see my gaming week so Mass Effect for me as well just like Alan I got sucked into Mass Effect amongst all the chatter of Mass Effect 3 and Shane basically bullied me into playing Mass Effect like basically would threaten to like kick me out of the WoW guild if I don't start playing Mass Effect or something like that
1356876	1358197	So, I've been playing it.
1358357	1360698	It's been amazing, as I've talked about in previous weeks on the show.
1361638	1364839	I'm just still cleaning up the loyalty missions and getting ready.
1365019	1366320	I've got to catch up to where Alan's at.
1367220	1369421	I have been playing a few other games, though, I want to tell you guys about.
1369541	1371541	One of them is old, and one of them is very new.
1372282	1376963	The old one I want to talk about tonight is a game I got for $15 at Target.
1377144	1378164	It was on clearance.
1378564	1404482	I might be partially responsible for this yes you were kind of an enabler you were like hey you should get this it's $15 and it has dance in it you'll like it and I pick up the box I'm like I think I heard about this game and I heard it was really basic and I looked at the song list I'm like well if it's basic it still has a really great song list so I pick up a game called Dance Paradise which was $15 which was one of the early Kinect games is that THQ or Ubisoft I want to say it's THQ that did this one
1405485	1406866	Um, here's the thing.
1406946	1408987	Dance Paradise, it has a really good song list.
1409628	1411589	It's got a, it's got like Lady Gaga.
1411689	1413711	It's, it's kind of a Euro infused song list.
1413751	1417473	It's like songs I think that were bigger, a little bit bigger on the other side of the pond.
1417753	1423177	Cause you got things like Jerry Hallowell and nobody, nobody cared about the Spice Girls in America once they split up.
1423257	1427900	But you know, it's, you got Lady Gaga, you got a few Rihanna.
1428320	1429961	It's basically gay bar in a box, right?
1430282	1434284	And you, you know, you know, it's going to be good music cause it's gay bar in a box and it's, it's a great song list.
1434304	1434805	Don't get me wrong.
1435665	1463838	and it's also really cool because you get the little music videos actually play in the background while you're playing which not every game has that was pretty cool but it's just it was so fucking basic like I don't know how else to describe this game like and the way you play it is really stupid like because you have to take us you start in the center and then to do a certain dance move you have to take a step to the left to do it
1464958	1466718	and then a step to the right and it's not the time warp.
1466979	1467859	Yes, exactly.
1468179	1471620	You jump to the left and step to the right but it's like Lady Gaga you're dancing to.
1472120	1477281	Imagine it looks like Rock Band where you have like the four columns that notes fall down.
1477741	1484983	Well, you have to literally walk into each column in order to do the move and instead of falling notes, you have falling dance moves.
1485423	1491344	So maybe you're like doing a little disco or you're opening your arms back and forth or, you know, kind of a lot of the same stuff you see in Dance Central.
1491704	1493305	But the fact that you move back and forth like...
1494125	1522824	who designed that that's just like that's not even that it's so weird for those who play connect in a loft giant warehouse floor for all the room you need to play it but here's the other thing that kind of disappointed me is that there was a good game in there somewhere because one of the things that was really cool about it was that some of the moves that you did mimicked the dance moves in the video and I thought well that's that's a good thing to see in a music game is like learn to do the dance from the
1523224	1523885	That was really cool.
1523945	1525826	Because Dance Central doesn't really even do that, right?
1525846	1527006	And that's the king of the crop.
1527086	1530868	You might see some, like, you'll definitely see, like, for, oh.
1532089	1533870	There's a little bit of booty in Baby Got Back.
1534270	1534990	Yeah, there's that.
1535030	1536371	And then, what the hell's that?
1539252	1540353	What's the Goblin Mail dance?
1540753	1541033	What's that?
1542034	1542674	Soulja Boy Teller.
1542754	1543374	Okay, Soulja Boy.
1543554	1544555	Okay, thank you.
1545255	1547376	Isn't it sad that that's how we communicate?
1547396	1548737	Okay.
1550344	1551005	We have problems.
1551085	1553866	And unfortunately, I know WoW just enough to understand that too now.
1553946	1555227	Okay, Soulja Boy.
1555587	1557448	You do that dance in Dance Central.
1557668	1563471	So some of the big ones are there, but it doesn't match the music video because Dance Central doesn't have the music videos.
1563811	1565192	And Dance Central is still a lot of fun.
1565232	1566332	I mean, it doesn't really matter.
1566733	1574957	But it kind of bothers me that you have really good licenses and a really kick-ass song list in Dance Paradise.
1575837	1579640	And then what was the other big competitor to Dance Central that came out?
1579720	1580721	Dance Masters.
1580761	1582502	Dance Masters, the Konami game.
1582942	1586005	Dance Masters is actually beautifully put together, if you think about it.
1586025	1587826	It's just par-a-par of Kinect, right?
1587966	1589707	Or even, not exactly.
1590408	1595672	There are three or four... There are three or four... Wow.
1595792	1596693	Yeah, talking words.
1596733	1596813	Woo!
1597443	1603648	There are three or four songs on the list that are Eurobeat and do have par-a-part routines.
1603949	1607492	But everything else, to the extent of my knowledge, completely original.
1607772	1614798	But it really is like fully-fledged dance minus walking around a stage, because Kinect is narrow-tracking.
1615338	1617819	A lot of them were like crossovers from DDR though.
1618059	1619559	They had a lot of DDR crossovers.
1619579	1621560	Oh yeah, everything was Konami original, period.
1622220	1629602	But the ones that weren't Parapara were very... The routines were actually... Well, they were fun to watch because I haven't exactly learned them yet.
1630243	1631103	But they were fun to watch.
1632223	1644826	Um, but they, they, there was some really weird, weird crossovers though, because like, I remember one of the songs was Exotic Ethnic, which I was trying to find in my, my archive here, but it's like, it's not really a song you can dance to.
1644886	1645987	I mean, it's a DDR song.
1646007	1655389	It's a great DDR song because the way DDR structured, but now that we're kind of beyond the dance pad and in the whole like free movement, Exotic Ethnic doesn't make a very good dancey song.
1657873	1665480	The routine from what I recall, the little bits and pieces, the song on DDR was like 200 beats per minute, something like that.
1665520	1666181	It was very fast.
1666201	1666681	I found it.
1666761	1667141	Here we go.
1667161	1673107	So you can kind of see what this looks like here and hear this song and see the routine and realize it doesn't really work very well.
1682029	1683751	What is up with the backup dancers?
1684031	1686534	This is like PG-13 here.
1686695	1687215	Look at this.
1693302	1696346	But anyway, it's a good song.
1696746	1700330	It was great back in the DDR days, but to freestyle move, it's weird.
1700911	1702453	And it doesn't really make sense.
1703436	1708959	So here's the thing, you've got a great interface and a great shell, not even just Dance Masters, but say Rhythm Party, right?
1708999	1714802	The game that just came out on Xbox Live Arcade that not even the Bomani community seems to care about at this point.
1715242	1718683	It's actually a really well put together game, and I've said that for weeks on the show.
1718743	1719864	There's a Bomani community?
1720424	1721405	Yeah, well, you know what I mean.
1721505	1724286	I think there's a Beatmania community and not much more than that.
1724446	1725026	What's left of it.
1725447	1727848	So you've got that, and then you have to, it's like,
1730586	1730987	and DarkSakura.com
1748147	1770676	or if you know THQ would take the risk and spend a little more time designing a game that people actually want to play and not just relying on the music to sell your game if they would both take that risk there could be a legit competitor to Dance Central which kind of has both but unfortunately both of them are looking to cash in a lot cheaper and don't want to take that financial risk which I can understand
1771141	1793109	Konami, a lot of these a lot of these companies that are producing these are when it comes to music and rhythm in my opinion they're mostly all on like the second tier and Konami as far as American and European releases minus DDR has pretty much become that has gotten to that has driven themselves down to that point as well notably starting with Rock Revolution.
1793129	1797951	Harmonix is now the top tier Harmonix is absolutely the top tier and Konami is now under them absolutely
1798587	1799368	I would sign on to that.
1799928	1801490	It's too bad, but there you go.
1819761	1820262	Here's the thing, though.
1820282	1821483	It's a bunch of classic tables.
1822224	1826911	It's the guys that made the Williams pinball collection and the Stern pinball collection.
1826951	1827912	Those games have already been out.
1828273	1831297	They just basically ported it to Xbox Live Arcade, but I see what they're doing.
1831317	1836083	They're piecemealing it because the game itself comes with four tables.
1836784	1838125	It's four damn good tables.
1838245	1840366	It's Ripley's Believe It or Not, which is a great table.
1840866	1845549	Arabian Nights and Theater of Magic and Black Hole are all great tables.
1845789	1848791	So it's like 800 Microsoft points for four killer tables.
1849271	1851913	And then they're going to do DLC later, like Pinbot.
1852353	1856195	The thing that they have that Pinball FX doesn't have is licenses.
1856235	1861299	Their license was Stern and Williams, so they're going to get all those tables into their game.
1861899	1870464	But if you already own the collections that came out on Xbox previously, I don't see the reason to get this whatsoever.
1870564	1876428	But for those that missed it and want their game a little cheaper and more piecemeal, if you like pinball, there's some great tables in there.
1877028	1881271	And I don't remember Theater of Magic being in the collection, so it's pretty cool that at least that game is there.
1881553	1882074	DarkSakura.com
1905997	1932741	uh Medieval Madness is DLC says Zether and I know I know I saw Pinbot in the list which is one of my favorites and you know they'll they'll kind of do that so you know Pinball FX I like it a lot it's got some great original tables I'm glad to see there's a little healthy competition now with both of them being out there and especially if you're a pinball fan it's a win-win situation so you know if you somehow missed the collection last time this is definitely worth checking out all right now I'm done with my gaming week

1964501	1964942	There you go.
1966503	1969266	Alright, let's get into some actual gaming news.
1970026	1971348	Jason, why don't you start us off tonight?
1971528	1979014	Harmonix has come full circle once again and is returning to its roots of a frequency amplitude inspired type of game.
1979395	1982638	Again, taking from the Rock Band franchise that they've been.
1983118	1983799	Thanks for watching!
1998551	2017308	A very famous point in Amplitude and Frequency's history where you could learn the exact track that you have to make to get the absolute max score, and Harmonix has responded to this by making Rock Band Blitz, a slightly simpler game, one track per instrument, and it was either two or three targets per instrument, I forget which,
2019029	2021510	But the power-ups aren't as track-specific.
2021550	2034114	The video is talking about a multi-measure note auto-player, and then there was a wrecking ball that kind of bounced around tracks in a diagonal manner, picking up notes along the way.
2034874	2056494	and there's also no concept of a combo that you have to continually go on one measure to the next to extend the combo and you can actually just jump from instrument to instrument and apparently it'll go a long way towards making a slightly unique sound, a slightly unique emphasis or you could just sit on your favorite instrument and play it the whole night.
2059417	2063600	and there's... It sounds like it's going to use your entire back catalog.
2063620	2071185	So if you've been playing since Rock Band and you've imported everything from game to game plus all the DLC that you bought, all the Rock Band Network and...
2072659	2075620	What was the indie version of Rock Band Network?
2075940	2078262	That is Rock Band Network, yeah.
2078302	2081883	Rock Band Store is the license, you know, all that stuff.
2082063	2085985	It's sounding like you should be able to have all of your official and indie content.
2087186	2095029	No specific pricing and no specific import restrictions due out just yet, but the game looks fun and it's always nice coming back to this style.
2095069	2096910	I had a lot of fun with Rock Band Unplugged as well.
2097662	2098143	It's interesting.
2098283	2101327	I was partially really excited by the news.
2101447	2112703	I have to admit a hint of disappointment because knowing that this is the big project Harmonix has been working on, I have to express a teeny bit of disappointment because I was like, oh, I was kind of hoping for something new.
2113524	2114265	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2130123	2132464	It doesn't... Does EA own Harmonix at this point?
2132524	2132944	No, they don't.
2133024	2134025	Harmonix is independent.
2134125	2135746	Yeah, they bought themselves out from MTV.
2135886	2138747	I was like, surely this is not behavior coming out of EA.
2139007	2141129	Well, that just proves Harmonix is independent.
2141669	2145991	So, yeah, because they're... Well, yeah, they're truly independent because they came off the MTV games.
2146011	2147612	That was where they were at when Rock Band started.
2148792	2150493	But just the value they're giving you there.
2150593	2158117	It's so amazing coming off the weeks of us talking about how developers want to lock you out of used games altogether.
2158637	2163180	Now it's like, here's a game that enhances the value of all the DLC you've already bought.
2163660	2165401	Like, well, fucking done.
2165601	2166201	Applause.
2166461	2166862	This is...
2168182	2173185	I mean, I feel like an asshole for saying that I even expressed a hint of disappointment at this game.
2174066	2176267	I'll definitely be picking it up day one.
2176307	2181750	I mean, now that I see kind of all the pieces and I'm like, okay, I did like amplitude and frequency a lot.
2182111	2185513	People did say they wanted a new frequency and amplitude.
2186013	2193337	Even though this isn't really it, it's what they could get away with doing and know that it's going to be profitable.
2194038	2195899	And so I'm excited for it.
2196059	2196319	I am.
2196760	2204497	The way that I look at it is that we had the simple arcade-style band...
2206697	2231053	I'm trying to avoid the word simulation because the point is we had the arcade style music experience and that was literally with like Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, the early Konami games and then Guitar Hero came around, put it solely on the guitar and then Rock Band came around and gave us the whole band and then Rock Band 3 came around which gave us the pro controllers and everything else where you can use a no kidding digital drum kit and have a
2231593	2233015	Thank you for watching!
2252372	2254033	That's not a bad decision.
2254393	2258015	I mean, fucking how many songs have I bought on Rock Band?
2258095	2261377	It is disgusting how much DLC I have on my Xbox 360.
2261557	2266860	You're going to buy either a $30 or $40 game and you're going to import, what, $200 in content automatically?
2267220	2268981	Rock Band Blitz is on Xbox Live Arcade.
2269021	2269902	It's at most going to be $20.
2269942	2270662	Oh, yeah.
2271082	2272343	So maybe even $10.
2273023	2273824	Probably less than $20 as well.
2274403	2275043	We love you, Harmonix.
2298110	2299771	It's iTunes for your consoles.
2300091	2304834	And a lot of us kind of laughed it off and said, oh, yeah, you're doing music.
2305174	2306434	You're not the same as iTunes.
2306494	2307795	iTunes is for your iPod.
2307835	2310777	And downloading a song into Rock Band is not the same as iTunes.
2311097	2314659	But now here we are years later, that's what they were setting the seeds for.
2314739	2316360	Because now they've enhanced.
2316440	2318781	You didn't just buy Rock Band DLC.
2319801	2324524	You bought a song that functions in multiple ways on your console.
2325546	2326206	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2349556	2353019	The sampler video plus audio little sequence or something.
2353640	2362287	And maybe there'll be something else at E3 this year because they've announced this in time for PAX, obviously, and we're showing it on the floor there.
2362347	2364088	Maybe they've got something else to show at E3.
2364469	2366851	Maybe they're working on something for the next wave of consoles.
2366951	2368892	Maybe it's something for the Wii U. Who knows?
2370293	2375478	So, again, my disappointment is like one grain of sand in a...
2376038	2377039	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2394855	2419897	but if you are willing to and you're interested they actually had a lot of positions available anything from creative to programming to design I think even like program management that kind of stuff if you're interested look them up that's all I have to say as Rob stuffs his face full of popcorn dead air I thought I had a break to eat my fault bad co-host it's alright you're learning learning
2422489	2425090	You have to learn how to fill in those gaps so I can be a fat ass.
2426570	2427130	You'll get there.
2428491	2429171	All right, anyhow.
2429691	2431971	Well, let me ask, Alan, you've been awfully quiet on that story.
2431991	2439073	I mean, I know you're not as huge in the music games as the rest of us, but surely that whole enhanced value thing is kind of making you go, hmm.
2439393	2445855	Yeah, I've kind of been abstaining because rock band and that whole genre, Guitar Hero, I never really...
2447569	2447609	Eh.
2447649	2447729	Yeah.
2462250	2464012	You could get that before there was Rock Band.
2464212	2470798	I don't have a smartphone with a camera to put it on Facebook, so if I can't blackmail you, then... Then where's the fun in that?
2470878	2471159	Yeah.
2471519	2471819	All right.
2471859	2474082	Well, another game was announced just this past week.
2474142	2476764	It's a game... It's a reimagining of an old game.
2476804	2477845	We've seen a few of these lately.
2478526	2481969	WayForward, the company that brought us... What the hell did they bring?
2482009	2482209	It was...
2484073	2485654	There was another... God damn it.
2485974	2486755	They did Blood Rain.
2486775	2488776	I think Blood Rain Betrayal was one of their games they did.
2488796	2489916	There's another one I was trying to think of.
2490377	2493038	But anyway, they are now taking over the Double Dragon franchise.
2494139	2496380	I had no idea that it was up for grabs, but it makes sense.
2496480	2499422	Majesco was the ones that got the Double Dragon franchise.
2500202	2501103	Who had it before?
2503097	2508640	I'm trying to remember, Trade West, maybe Midway had it, and it was one of the things that went under when they went under.
2509220	2518365	But Majesco got the Double Dragon franchise, so it's being reinvented as Double Dragon Neon, which is going to come out on Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.
2518805	2520466	Why did they call it Double Dragon Neon?
2521126	2523988	Well, because it is 80s-tastic.
2526138	2528061	The colors, the colors.
2528141	2530324	You're the best around.
2530905	2533268	Hopefully that can be in the game, but I don't know.
2533589	2534350	There is a trailer.
2534410	2534890	Let me show you.
2534910	2538455	Let me play some of this for you because it does have some nice remixed music.
2541960	2542561	And you can notice...
2543735	2546597	The way the characters move is very fluid and all that.
2547717	2549579	You know, it looks really nice in HD.
2551640	2553101	Yeah, that is pretty neon.
2553181	2556223	Yeah, and everybody's very like 80s infused.
2556243	2562346	Like you see the afros and the leather jackets and the boots with the fur on them and all that stuff.
2563567	2570031	You know, call me crazy or call me stupid if this already happened, but you know what I'd love to see a very modern remake of in this style?
2570391	2571652	Captain America and the Avengers.
2573208	2577309	Well, especially when there's the movie and everything, but I think they did another game for that.
2577750	2578190	Here's the thing.
2578270	2579830	Here's my concern with Double Dragon Neon.
2580090	2583111	Okay, I bought Double Dragon when it was available on Xbox Live Arcade.
2583131	2589213	It's not available anymore, obviously, but it was available on Xbox Live Arcade for a short time when, you know, other people had the license.
2589353	2591094	We played it together and we did.
2591174	2591354	We did.
2591374	2594255	And then DarkSakura's Dan yelled at us for trashing it.
2594515	2595135	I remember that.
2595596	2599377	Yes, because we played through it and we were like, this game isn't very good.
2600197	2602400	What the hell were we smoking when we were 12?
2602720	2603682	This game sucks
2605031	2617935	And now I'm looking at this going, it looks like it's a faithful port of the original Double Dragon game, but Double Dragon, and maybe I'm just old, but it kind of gets old after the first stage.
2617955	2620676	You're like, punch, punch, kick, kick, kick, and I'm over it.
2621376	2626958	What Double Dragon founded, Final Fight made better, and I'd rather play that.
2627298	2631240	But even playing Final Fight now, playing any of those old fighting games just doesn't feel the same.
2632060	2632681	Bad Dudes.
2632821	2633943	Yeah, they're all the same.
2634003	2639030	It would be cool if they could incorporate some of what we see in new fighting games a little bit.
2639110	2643316	Maybe more like versus and special moves and combo attacks.
2643797	2644298	Oh, God.
2645179	2646100	Don't give them ideas.
2647182	2663030	but I will I will uh I'll at least check out the demo I will say that so that's coming out uh this summer on so what you're saying is you want them to bring back that mode from tech and tag tournament that that side scrolling tech and tag actually that mode kicked ass so yes I want them to bring that back
2665027	2668871	It was a little bit more fun because there was the entire moveset and a little bit more depth to a side-scroller.
2668891	2670152	And you could play it as Panda.
2670973	2676278	And the concept of a fighting game where a Panda bear beats up everyone is pretty fucking awesome.
2676358	2677019	You have to admit.
2677339	2678260	I think they brought that out.
2678280	2679481	It's just not a side-scroller.
2680042	2680482	Oh, right.
2680743	2681283	Wow did.
2681984	2682685	Or about to.
2682885	2684006	Panda kills everyone.
2684787	2685087	Anyhow.
2687233	2689575	Wow reference number five today?
2690335	2691436	That was dead for me.
2691636	2692476	Yeah, sorry.
2693077	2693557	Sorry, guys.
2694198	2703784	So for Pokemon fans and SRPG fans, Nintendo of America is bringing Pokemon and Nobunaga's Ambition.
2706666	2706906	What?
2708047	2709007	Nobunaga's Ambition.
2709027	2709848	Nobunaga.
2710248	2710828	Nobunaga.
2711229	2711969	Cowabunga.
2712269	2712870	Cowabunga?
2712890	2713230	Oh.
2715850	2737963	they're bringing that to the US called Pokemon Conquest and it's coming out on June 18th and you play a warlord who has a Pokemon pal and you have to build up your army and it's skirmish based and it's an SRPG and if you follow import games and you're a fan of Nobunaga's Ambition this is great
2739827	2745050	You know, I remember when I heard that this game was coming out in Japan, I was like, what a weird fucking idea.
2745911	2749573	And to hear that this game is actually coming out here, I have mixed emotions.
2749753	2751514	Look, I get it.
2751614	2756037	Pokemon has its rabid fanbase that will buy almost anything that ties into Pokemon.
2756077	2759359	Like, I'm totally, like, I understand that, fine.
2759960	2760100	But...
2760908	2768134	How on earth does the US get Pokemon and Nobunaga's Ambition relatively close to the Japanese release?
2768194	2771156	You know, within a year, yes, I would call close for Nintendo for a game like this.
2771657	2775220	Yet, we had to pull out fucking teeth to get Xenoblade.
2778405	2790585	is this an example of maybe I guess technically it wasn't a Nintendo game because Tecmo designed it maybe that's the key difference Pokemon just shits money and it's the Pokemon factor
2791392	2814934	I mean, it's... Even if the whole feudal warlord fails to grab onto people, it can still be propped up and kept afloat at least a little bit more with something like, oh, I don't know, a Pokemon franchise, which is insanely popular, as opposed to a... I'm not going to say an underground favorite, but definitely a less-trafficked series in the Xenogears, Xenosaga, Xenocore line.
2817681	2824426	I understand why they changed the name because you don't exactly have your raving Nobunaga Ambition fans here in the US.
2824446	2835556	They had a few of them on the NES, like Nobunaga and Romance of the Three Kingdoms and some of that, but that series has kind of been deader than dead here for years, or at least I think it exists on the PC.
2835996	2839019	It definitely has a cult following, but nothing mainstream.
2839039	2839459	Yeah.
2839799	2841621	So I get why they changed the name.
2841661	2843282	You know there's going to be those purists, though.
2843442	2848266	There's always some goddamn purist who's going to be like, why couldn't they just call it Pokemon Nobunaga?
2849127	2851329	They dumped it down for stupid Americans.
2851489	2853410	Stupid Americans.
2853490	2854731	Get off your goddamn horse.
2854992	2857213	They changed it for Americans, indeed.
2857374	2865600	Yes, they did change it for Americans, because we don't have two new Nobunaga Ambition games coming out on consoles every year like they do in Japan.
2866001	2866461	Wake up!
2869862	2872005	It's fucking amazing this game is coming out here in the first place.
2872025	2872886	That's basically my point.
2873406	2882217	And it sounds like it has six on six battles and battle conditions can change on every turn, keeping players on their toes in anticipation of what will happen next.
2883218	2883839	Me, me, me, me, me.
2885737	2892842	Fancy pants reading of the quote and this article from Scott Moffat, Nintendo of America's Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing.
2893722	2899786	Pokemon fans are always interested in playing in new environments and experiencing new adventures.
2900186	2910713	Pokemon Conquest gives them an entirely new way to enjoy this beloved series, with exciting new settings, fierce battles, and nearly 200 Pokemon to team up with.
2910913	2913435	Read that first phrase again in that quote real quick.
2913915	2915015	In that voice or normally?
2915376	2916156	Whatever you want.
2916816	2922498	Pokemon fans are always interested in playing in new environments and experiencing new adventures.
2922518	2922958	Okay, okay.
2923158	2924299	You know what that translates to?
2924799	2928640	Pokemon fans will open up their wallets and give us all their... They will buy fucking everything.
2928660	2932742	They will buy any fucking thing that we put in front of them and they will like it.
2933542	2939369	If this was something that we were head over heels interested in, we have a quote for this too.
2940250	2942552	Shut up and take my money!
2942772	2943433	Exactly.
2943553	2945135	As I screw up the quote the first time.
2946216	2946516	I got it.
2949580	2950901	But I know people like that.
2951502	2952363	Shane's like that.
2953264	2954885	He probably has his pre-order in already.
2958183	2959423	Not that there's anything wrong with that.
2959763	2960884	Alright, let's go on to the next story.
2961424	2961904	Was that mine?
2962484	2963684	I'm keeping up, I swear.
2964065	2964925	My computer isn't, though.
2967065	2971626	Max Payne is being brought out again and being adapted to iOS.
2972427	2972907	Was this one?
2972967	2977148	I think this one... Yeah, an Android version is actually going to come a couple of weeks later.
2977868	2982329	The current rumor says that Max Payne for iOS is going to come out on April 12th.
2982409	2984770	I believe that is Wednesday of this coming week.
2986850	2992393	As to be expected, the game is going to be scaled down and adapted so that you can get your bullet time portable on.
2993153	3008420	Purely on-screen controls, no talk about any kind of a controller or anything to do that, but you can start diving around and rolling around and falling off the... Oh, what was that scene where you were going in like a drug craze and you had that terrible walkway to navigate against?
3008440	3010521	That's going to be really, really bad with touch controls.
3010541	3010861	Yeah.
3011381	3037155	most ports are really really bad with touch controls that's what makes the story interesting because like I that was the other game I didn't mention in my gaming week is that Midway for the 200th time re-released their whole classic arcade game machine classic arcade game compilation and I picked it up in all the packs so I have Yarve, Gauntlet the sequel to Smash TV same characters
3038556	3039136	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3064153	3065634	and that sucks!
3067174	3073076	I would have been less torn up if there was an optional D-pad, but the fact that it's purely tilt is just a pain in the ass.
3073956	3075037	I think I have that same one.
3075097	3077257	It's the Williams Collection or something it's called.
3077277	3078438	I thought it was Midway specifically.
3078918	3079698	It's only on my iPad.
3079738	3080858	It's over in the other room.
3081219	3081879	I have it.
3081939	3083599	It's called Midway Arcade.
3083639	3084580	It looks just like that, right?
3084860	3085820	Okay, I have it too.
3086360	3089541	And Spy Hunter, speaking of that game, is in it.
3089621	3090882	And it fucking sucks.
3090922	3091082	Yep.
3092282	3093823	Like, that's not how I want to play the game.
3113596	3114837	Joust works surprisingly alright.
3114857	3116379	The other two are Skee-Ball and that dumb little basketball game.
3116399	3117741	Which aren't even fucking midway games, they're just...
3133397	3135178	But you still get tickets from them.
3135198	3135879	Exactly.
3135899	3138921	You can get the virtual prizes from the prize stand.
3138981	3140822	You know what I've learned to do to get virtual tickets?
3140882	3142883	Here's your player's tip for Midway Arcade.
3143303	3148187	Just fucking sit there and start skee-ball and go, just swipe your finger nine times really fast.
3148427	3149768	Restart nine times really fast.
3150008	3150408	Restart.
3150528	3153850	I managed to get a 900 game within about five or six times of trying.
3154711	3155251	There you go.
3155691	3157032	So, Max Payne this week.
3157272	3158513	Android about a week and a half later.
3159914	3161635	And everything else, Touch World.
3161755	3162716	Okay, moving on.
3163410	3165492	Can I ask this real quick before we get into the next story?
3165672	3166452	Or do you want to say something?
3166813	3166933	No.
3167253	3168134	Okay.
3168994	3172998	Did you hear the news around the internet this week about how Instagram came out for Android?
3173138	3174099	Mm-hmm.
3175360	3184227	And was suddenly bashed by all the iPhone users everywhere that was like, ugh, I can't believe Instagram is slumming it up on Android.
3184607	3186909	Hipstergram is now Losergram.
3187549	3187689	Ugh.
3187709	3187769	Ugh.
3188790	3194453	They need to come out with something new on the iPhone because I refuse to use an app that exists on Android.
3195073	3196994	What the fuck is up with that attitude?
3197414	3198434	Where does that come from?
3199615	3201936	All the same holy wars that divide them in the first place.
3202096	3208499	The same brainwashing that has them upgrade a personal appliance every fucking nine months for $500 and they see nothing wrong with that.
3209359	3210139	Same attitude.
3210559	3212900	I'm going to club you with my iPhone if you keep talking.
3213301	3213741	I'll help.
3216041	3217141	But I'm not like that.
3217422	3223284	I love it when Android users get the same apps because sometimes we can still play together and stuff.
3223684	3226065	I'm totally fine with Android users having the apps.
3226225	3230766	All my Android buddies have all the same Words with Friends, Hanging with Friends.
3231307	3235208	I'm sorry, I haven't joined the Zynga Must Die petition completely yet.
3235708	3240770	I haven't started Draw Something for that reason, but I still play Words with Friends, Hanging with Friends, and Scramble with Friends.
3240810	3242111	That's right, I'll just judge you from back here.
3242451	3242831	Exactly.
3243271	3246055	All the way across the table, give that evil glare for the rest of the show.
3247538	3249521	He still gives money to Zynga.
3249761	3253507	I would ask Jason to host the show again, but he fucking plays Zynga games.
3253787	3254588	He's so not cool.
3255590	3280625	and then there are some other games we've played like there was I can't even recall the name of it but there was some pool simulator that had like eight ball nine ball and different different table arrangements and that kind of stuff and yeah those are all cross-platform and since they're since they're asynchronous and just alternating they work very well they're they're very nice and they get everybody involved okay going to our chat room at chat.orangelunchradio.com Tiger Claw says Sky it's Apple fanboys they are elitists no they're not
3282603	3284025	I'm an Apple fanboy.
3284125	3285827	I'm the guy that buys the iPhone every time.
3285847	3289251	And your desktop is a Windows machine?
3289992	3294718	I'm by... Alan, I have to tell you something.
3294878	3296440	I'm by computer-al.
3297381	3298022	By portable.
3298062	3301626	And you have the sense to skip a release before you upgrade.
3302315	3302896	Yeah, alright.
3304177	3305179	Dig yourself out of that hole.
3306100	3310626	Although, also recall one of the first couple of words out of my mouth after I walked in here last time.
3311247	3312468	Wow, I'm in Windows World.
3312748	3313610	This feels weird.
3313810	3315692	Okay, then, fanboy.
3315953	3317134	You're worse than I am, clearly.
3317174	3318396	Do you consider yourself an elitist?
3320885	3348026	you have to think about this I can't I can talk like it I don't mean it I mean when I was when I had my whole phone switching debacle I actively looked at what Sprint had offerings for both Android and Windows and because I had an iPad I was more than willing to get a different phone because I still had something to let me get done with the tools that I wanted to use but Sprint's selection was fucking garbage and they have the 4S so I was like okay I'm done I figured it out
3349238	3351560	and that's the story of how I have the latest phone.
3351600	3352121	There you go.
3354343	3355524	Alright, let's go.
3356265	3357246	It's not the Apple show.
3357286	3358447	Let's move on to this story.
3358527	3360008	That's my other show that I do.
3360789	3361329	Oh, that's right.
3361369	3363271	You really do have an Apple show.
3363371	3363672	I do.
3363912	3366474	I should let you guys plug your podcast because he has one too.
3366514	3369157	I'll let you do that at the start of the next half of the show.
3369637	3381224	All right, for now, let's talk about the Wii U and a rumor about the Wii U. And usually I don't like to talk about rumors like these, but it was kind of a slow news week because everybody was in Boston with the PAX East thing.
3381464	3383826	Which, by the way, we will have some phone calls on that later.
3384486	3385347	But for now... We better.
3385747	3386107	Rumors.
3386567	3387988	Yeah, we better because I didn't go this year.
3388028	3388709	I'm kind of sad.
3388829	3391390	So some of the other all-game shows had it covered.
3391871	3396553	But, you know, I might go to West Coast this year, which is really exciting.
3396673	3396794	So...
3397894	3399636	That day sounds awfully familiar.
3418069	3420091	That's five years later, isn't it?
3421172	3422754	Didn't the Wii launch right around that day?
3422854	3423695	Did the Wii U launch?
3423815	3425837	Or did the regular Wii launch November 18th?
3425917	3426537	I don't remember.
3426838	3428339	It was just before Thanksgiving.
3429060	3430902	Because it was just before I moved out of Arizona.
3432223	3437008	Apparently it's coming from a Japanese retailer email or something like that is where this date is coming from.
3437128	3439070	So, you know, take it or leave it.
3439410	3441292	But November 18th is the day, so...
3443357	3463759	I here's my honest reaction to that I don't think Nintendo knows the day yet I don't think Nintendo's picked the day yet I think Nintendo in part is waiting to hear what Microsoft and Sony are doing although I guess they have to release a date at E3 but they don't maybe they don't have to I want to say they didn't announce the Wii release date till after E3 that year I don't even I don't even remember mm-hmm
3465908	3469610	The Wii came out on November 19th, 2006.
3470150	3471831	Oh, so close.
3471871	3472351	Well, okay.
3472831	3476373	At least that shows that they're aiming for the same weekend, essentially.
3479474	3491359	I would not put it past a retailer to stub a date based off what they saw before to have some record in their system so they can start saying, pre-order, pre-order, give us your money, or at least some of it.
3494429	3495310	So, yep.
3496132	3496793	There you go.
3496993	3497394	Another day.
3497574	3499216	Wii U, another day, another rumor.
3499256	3499957	What else can you say?
3500658	3501660	Alright, moving on.
3503587	3519622	So there's been a lot of anger over Street Fighter X Tekken that Capcom put out a couple weeks ago in regards to all of the launch day, launch week DLC available that is on the disc that you have to pay to unlock.
3519742	3525227	And I know if Loki were here, he would be pitching a fit right now because this is obviously a thorn in his side.
3526028	3526108	Um...
3527469	3532794	There have been a lot of Better Business Bureau complaints about this and Capcom has finally released a statement.
3534195	3542562	It's very professionally coded and groomed to say, we're sorry you feel that way, but
3544662	3546883	We didn't do anything wrong, nanny nanny boo boo.
3565231	3590386	it doesn't matter if the DLC is available on the day after the release date or three weeks you still have to pay whatever five six bucks PSN points Xbox live points to access the content so there's no difference between content that's on the disc that you have to pay to unlock versus stuff that's downloaded later and they're saying you know that the the disc the product of the game
3591283	3613855	When that has to go gold, when they actually say this game is done, and then the release date, which comes a couple months later, even if that extra content that comes later still makes it on the disc, from their point of view, it was always intended to be something supplementary to the original product, and they're not wrong, because Xbox and PSN lets them do this.
3614935	3615876	And they're sorry, but...
3616616	3617318	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3625373	3626874	You're a fighting game fan, I know that.
3627735	3644950	Given what happened with Street Fighter 4 and Mortal Kombat, I basically learned to just say screw fighting games and wait until two years later, which I know some people in chat are like, a two-year-old game, but they're going to release a comprehensive game of the year full bullshitty DLC edition.
3645130	3645911	I'd rather buy that.
3645971	3649114	They have sworn they're not doing it this time.
3649714	3651476	Unless you want to get the Vita version or whatever.
3652017	3664610	then sure, that's what Loki says get the Vita version you have a Vita, we can get it, whatever that was code for Rob, buy it for your Vita and let me play it let me play it when you're at work
3667253	3671675	I guess it's sleazy, but like they said, it's not wrong.
3672976	3682000	You know, I'm playing Mass Effect 2, which has a lot of several hour long DLC episode packs for admissions with bonus weapons and blah, blah, blah.
3682441	3684962	But the game itself is already so long that you don't
3685575	3693560	You don't really need it, and it's just being a completionist and knowing that I want to play Troll Mega Man so bad, but I don't have to, but I want to, and it's on the disc.
3694480	3700504	And it's just, you know... It's frustrating to know that it's right there on the disc, but they want you to pay... I mean, that's the frustrating thing about it.
3700524	3703005	At least the Mass Effect 2 stuff, you actually download.
3703405	3709289	And while there might be seeds of information on the disc, you're still downloading a good chunk of the dialogue and all that.
3709309	3710609	You're actually downloading.
3711270	3712851	You're not able to hack it off the disc.
3712871	3713251	Right.
3713431	3721961	In my opinion, Capcom may think this is the more convenient way to do it or whatever, but the hacking community is kind of teaching them a lesson here.
3722382	3725786	If you want to go that route, here's the price you're going to pay for it.
3726346	3729870	And it kind of sucks that legitimate users get screwed in the end.
3730051	3732053	And that's where Capcom is starting to look like idiots.
3732173	3734094	They can't do their own fucking job?
3759716	3765443	But if this is the more convenient way to do it, then police it your goddamn self.
3768546	3796499	I guess to save themselves a lot of wank from their fans have it be available on launch day digitally do not put that shit on the disc for any reason at all and even if people want to make the argument that well it's Tuesday morning and I have the disc and now you're saying there's $40 worth of DLC for me to get why wasn't it on the disc they could just say well it because it's you know you have to download it it's not on the disc and that'll remove a lot of the argument that the hackers have right now
3797614	3801557	Acidic Vampire in our chatroom says, Ultimately, it's their decision to make it pay to unlock.
3801817	3806340	It sucks, but if you want to have it your way, you should wait until the final Ultimate Edition is eventually released.
3806940	3807801	Yeah, exactly.
3808221	3811763	The vote with your wallet statement, which I think a lot of us are on board with.
3811783	3812644	Yeah, I didn't buy it.
3812804	3821450	And this is a big part of the reason I didn't buy it was because Capcom has historically shown that even if they swear up and down they're not going to do it this time, I don't believe them.
3821790	3826794	I'm not going to buy it until there's the Ultimate Edition or I'm at least going to wait until the disc is down to like 20 bucks.
3828234	3832715	Then I'll buy that, and then the 20 bucks to unlock everything, that'll be about the game right there, right?
3833715	3850059	And I guess, according to this story, the hackers, I guess, that have figured out how to play those pay-to-unlock characters online without having to actually get the DLC, apparently Jill and Shuma Gorath from MVC3
3851659	3856283	were on the disc launch day as paid-on-lock characters, but they were incomplete assets.
3856604	3864151	So to pull down that final 20% that made them playable, that was a remote file package that you had to bring down to your console.
3865052	3866353	Which is probably what they should have done here.
3868164	3871427	Capcom left characters on the disc and the hackers saw it as a personal challenge.
3883436	3889218	And they took it, they ran with it, and gee, what number of times is this that we've heard it?
3889438	3890518	The millionth and a half?
3890938	3891518	Absolutely.
3891879	3895220	Well, you know the old saying, hacker's gonna hack, right?
3895720	3897520	Haters gonna hate and hackers gonna hack.
3898040	3906623	So when you say your system is unhackable, that is like printing a wedding invitation to all the hackers, says you are cordially invited to hack the fuck out of this box.
3906723	3910044	Not only did they take the box, but they took the whole damn network and almost the company.
3910744	3915149	I mean, what set everybody off about PlayStation when they removed Linux?
3916110	3917572	You want to piss off a hacker?
3917852	3919113	Take their Linux away.
3920154	3920915	I mean, for real.
3922377	3928103	Take away their command line, take away their way of exploring, and they'll make a new way, brute or not.
3929196	3934540	And for people that work in IT, that are hardcore crypto people, they don't even have to be gamers.
3934640	3937682	They'll see the stuff as a Rubik's Cube.
3938402	3940104	Exactly like you said, it's a gauntlet thrown down.
3940144	3940804	It's a challenge.
3941505	3946328	Once they release into the crack community, here's how you unlock this.
3946848	3947869	They may not even be gamers.
3947889	3952352	They're just really into crypto, and the community is there, and they're always going to find a way around it.
3953007	3960916	It is pretty surprising that they're not only hacking, but they're going activist with it and actually playing these in matches and using it as advertising.
3960936	3966442	That's pretty ballsy to go on Xbox Live with your gamer tag and be all, look at me, bitch.
3966542	3970926	I know a lot of people that have a lot of safeguards in place that on a console that is hacked...
3971627	3972628	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3994423	3998567	Interesting, because now people in our chatroom are talking about what is likely next.
3998687	4000990	And Wyland says, I won't buy Darkstalkers 4.
4001871	4005474	But Stan says, I'll totally buy Darkstalkers 4, even if there's stupid DLC.
4005534	4006836	I've been waiting for that forever.
4007296	4010459	Actdeft says, I'll buy Darkstalkers 4 when the Ultimate Edition comes out.
4010960	4012161	This is interesting.
4012281	4012541	Has...
4013442	4022308	Have the reputation of fighting games been tarnished due to not just the behavior of Capcom, but if you think about it, Mortal Kombat and WB Games didn't really do anything different.
4022368	4025830	Granted, they didn't leave it on the disc, but they did release extra fighters.
4026151	4033796	February or March, they had the comprehensive Freddy Krueger, Scarlet, Kenji DLC edition.
4034156	4034536	Exactly.
4034576	4037218	So it's not just Capcom, if you think about it.
4038109	4044232	I still stand by my argument that EVO has something to do with the timing and the extensive release and all that kind of stuff.
4044312	4052317	I really do feel that that factors in because fighting games have thankfully stepped back into the mainstream and EVO, if there's something bigger than that, I don't know what it is.
4052377	4053517	At least here in the States, of course.
4055118	4081324	yeah I don't have a specific point that comes off that I just think it ties into all of this is has Namco and Tekken and Soul Calibur done this shit I don't think they have they're still the one franchise that's relatively um because well Soul Calibur okay if you had Yoda you could pay to get Vader and if you had Vader because of the version you bought you could pay to unlock Yoda but that was that was really it it was one character and everyone knew that was going to happen
4081721	4082402	5 Princess Packs Costume Packs
4096021	4122801	but that's that's still shitty but it's cosmetic whereas in this it's players characters right I mean it's not it I think what they're doing is not nearly as bad as what's happening here over at Capcom you know and if you're into the design character stuff which I know some of our listeners are I got one of our listeners sent a bunch of custom characters he made and a lot of them are just hilarious like they're they're great real-life interpretations made in the game but
4123362	4133657	and with even more stuff I can just imagine the additional opportunities that opens up but that's totally different than a whole different character is here on the disc
4136076	4136476	I can't remember.
4136496	4136597	Right.
4157403	4158364	Alright, let's move on.
4158564	4164788	Let's talk about what games are coming out to a retailer near you that will require you to buy it in the store and then buy all the DLC later.
4165708	4168350	Okay, maybe not, but what's coming out in the US, Jason?
4168450	4174394	Especially considering the selection that I have to work with, if any of these games have DLC, that would scare me to death.
4176876	4179439	Pretty light week as far as I see from the next week.
4179579	4184585	Three games that I don't know if I should even go on with them, but here they are.
4185486	4189011	3DS, Spirit Camera, The Cursed Memoir, with bonus!
4190000	4191701	Drops on the 13th.
4192522	4193542	Oh, that's just a strategy guide.
4193562	4194423	Why is that in a game?
4194603	4196044	You failtastic.
4196744	4199466	Also for the Nintendo DS, Titanic Mystery.
4200066	4203588	Maybe with DLC you can float the ship back up with ping pong balls.
4203929	4205209	I solved the mystery.
4206070	4206710	It sinks.
4209512	4212814	It was Colonel Mustard in the ballroom with the anchor.
4214695	4215876	And lastly... With the iceberg.
4222904	4223484	I'll never let go, Jack.
4223504	4223865	I'll never let go.
4243874	4249740	We were watching Titan AE last night and the very ending had a very similar situation.
4250021	4250721	I'll never let go.
4251022	4251842	I'll never let go.
4252143	4252763	I'll save you.
4253124	4253825	I let you go.
4253965	4254425	Be free.
4254645	4255386	Save the rest of us.
4255747	4256187	At any rate.
4257068	4259551	Lastly, oh, so, Titanic Mystery is...
4260551	4261972	That's not next week, that's two days ago.
4261992	4264614	Okay, I apologize, this just failed a lot.
4264954	4271818	Spirit Camera for the DS, Titanic Mystery for the DS, 4-in-1 Action Pack for the PS3 drops on Tuesday.
4273219	4273720	Quiet week.
4275140	4276021	An unexciting week.
4276934	4279195	Well, let's go to Japan and see if it's any different over there.
4279515	4291779	On the 12th, in Japan, on the Nintendo 3DS, Nikoli no Sudoku 3D Dai Nishu Eitsu no Puzzle Day 1000 Mon That is, for real, the name of the game.
4291839	4293520	It's fucking Sudoku in 3D.
4294540	4294880	Okay.
4296621	4303463	Like, can somebody explain to me how Sudoku is fucking enhanced in three dimensions?
4304229	4304710	I can do that.
4304730	4304870	What?
4304890	4305351	Pseudocubed.
4320549	4320969	S, Actdeft,
4347507	4350249	I think you just alienated 80% of the listeners.
4351069	4353071	Look, it's like Mass Effect.
4353111	4353971	You get a choice.
4355112	4356873	You can point the thing up or down.
4361076	4363678	You were worried about tonight being a dry night.
4367840	4369922	How about the Vita?
4371463	4372063	How about it?
4372163	4374545	In Japan this week, Rayman Origins.
4374945	4376126	And, ready...
4377188	4381993	Nikolai no Sudoku 5, Shugyoku number 12 puzzle.
4382053	4382553	That's right.
4382994	4385536	It's a Sudoku game on the Vita as well.
4386597	4387578	Is that a swastika?
4387638	4388259	What is that?
4388980	4389980	That's one of the puzzles.
4390041	4391602	That is a swastika.
4391622	4393164	No, that is not a swastika.
4393244	4394365	That is not Sudoku.
4395526	4396307	It's rotated.
4396667	4397688	That is not a swastika.
4397708	4398609	Look at it diagonally.
4399069	4399590	I need the chair.
4400825	4404008	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4424289	4426350	How about on the consoles?
4426430	4430973	Maybe there's something to save us on the PlayStation 3 this week in Japan.
4431893	4432614	Dirt 3!
4433834	4435295	You get Sudoku or Dirt.
4435955	4442519	Also, Grand Slam Tennis 2 and Rayman Origins on the PlayStation 3.
4443579	4448682	And lastly, on the Xbox 360, nothing, because no one owns a 360 in Japan.
4449543	4452044	No, seriously, there's nothing on the 360 this week in Japan.
4453200	4456341	How about Europe, UK, all those countries over there?
4458781	4462602	Looks like a light week over on the UK side or the Europe side as well.
4463282	4474505	On the 11th, I have Football Manager handheld for the Android, Legend of Grimrock for the PC, Skullgirls for PlayStation 3 and 360.
4475865	4478746	On the 12th, we have Max Payne Mobile, which we just covered.
4479586	4481187	Tribes Ascend for the PC.
4481908	4483749	On the 13th, Fez.
4484849	4487030	F-E-Z, not Rez, but Fez.
4487050	4488811	Maybe your little Shriners in the little cars.
4489032	4489432	I don't know.
4489772	4490272	Fez for the 360.
4491373	4493934	On the 14th, Pandora's Tower for the Wii.
4496496	4497736	Which is kind of a big deal.
4498677	4500538	That's one of those Operation Rainfall games.
4501439	4502079	Pandora's Tower?
4503500	4506401	So while we wait here in the U.S., everybody's going to be pirating it.
4507302	4507402	Yeah.
4508749	4509610	because that's what people do.
4510851	4511171	All right.
4511711	4512512	I'm just kidding, kids.
4512572	4513813	Don't pirate.
4513853	4521258	Someone on my Facebook just mentioned getting Center Blade Chronicles like they just bought it in the store this week and I was like, what?
4521718	4522299	Oh, yeah.
4522359	4525261	I guess we should only really be playing that starting this week.
4525381	4525601	Yep.
4526502	4526922	Oops.
4528703	4531706	I would have loved to have bought Xenoblade a year ago.
4532846	4533647	But not from GameStop.
4533847	4535889	Nintendo, you've made the bed, now lie in it.
4536269	4536529	All right.
4537670	4538110	Moving on.
4538290	4541052	Let's do one other quick story before we get to the classic game of the week.
4541433	4543154	DarkSakura's not here tonight.
4543254	4550279	I know she's in the chat and she can scream all she wants, but we're taking the classic game of the week car and driving it in another direction tonight.
4550339	4550940	So here we go.
4551700	4552741	Jason, one more story, though.
4554304	4582974	by the way the chat oh there was hey well I'll say this real quick the chat room is lighting up saying there is that what we know as a swastika in Japanese can be a manji which is actually a good luck and some old video games had that for instance there were some dungeons in Zelda somebody was saying in our chat room kind of looked like that I remember it was 1942 and 1943 had those symbols in the Japanese versions and they were like extra life or something
4583474	4586196	So, and it's not controversial there because it has a different meaning.
4586537	4589078	It also looks mirrored to me, I think.
4589158	4591420	Yes, I believe it's the other direction.
4591500	4599747	But obviously that's a pretty easy mistake for commoners, so generally games that would have had it and come to America get it just changed to something else entirely or just stripped out.
4600027	4600187	Yes.
4604860	4613404	New York has booted all of its registered sex offenders off online gaming networks.
4613825	4618007	Microsoft, Sony, Blizzard, EA, and Apple all cooperated with the purge.
4618467	4626313	which follows a court case in the state of New York in which a 19-year-old pleaded guilty to abusing a 10-year-old he met on Xbox Live.
4627114	4635020	New York law demands all convicted sex offenders to hand over any email addresses and online aliases to help limit their access on vulnerable web networks.
4635380	4638802	However, this is the first time it's ever been invoked in relation to online gaming.
4639883	4646468	Pretty... We never went through this six years ago with UNO.
4647749	4648890	Yeah, we're finally here.
4649030	4650852	Oh God, Strip Uno, I remember that story.
4651272	4652794	Look, here's the thing though.
4653294	4660320	Obviously, people that would do that stuff to kids are not okay and they need to be dealt with in ways like this.
4660420	4661001	I get that.
4661181	4664504	But there's another side to this that kind of bothers me.
4665545	4669489	What parent was letting their 10-year-old play on Xbox Live unsupervised?
4670168	4670908	Hello?
4670928	4674869	Did they just not know what happens on Xbox Live?
4674929	4676610	I'm like, ignorance is not an excuse.
4677490	4678090	You know what I mean?
4678270	4682851	Like, that should be a wake-up call to parents everywhere.
4682971	4686632	You need to supervise children that are going to play games online like that.
4687833	4692534	Again, I'm not saying what the 19-year-old did was right.
4692634	4693694	That's no excuse.
4693774	4697255	But I'm just saying there's kind of a couple things wrong in this picture.
4697935	4698696	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
4715634	4721038	Sometimes it was just myself and my sister, who is three years older than me, but sometimes it was just straight up me.
4721659	4728084	Oftentimes, especially after my sister grew up and moved out, it was just myself in the house all weekend.
4729025	4731908	This is before the years of online gaming, functionally.
4732308	4733769	This technology doesn't exist then.
4733789	4735471	Yeah, this is just a modern version of that.
4736051	4740132	These situations, and I completely understand where you're coming from.
4741712	4742812	One, there are bad parents.
4742892	4745113	Two, there are bad situations with good parents.
4748073	4759095	It would be great if parental controls were a lot more perfect, if Microsoft could step in a lot better and have some kind of a camera filter, or if they were just kind of smarter about it.
4759175	4762176	But these situations happen, and it's incredibly unfortunate.
4762316	4790092	I can kind of meet you halfway there because when I was probably about 12 or 13 on my Commodore 64 on my 300 baud modem I was calling into BBS's local bulletin board systems and posting on message boards and playing door games I was fucking playing Legend of the Red Dragon and shit at like 14 and 15 right which you know if you ever played those games back in the day they were not very nice games and my mom just said oh he's on the computer you know and I was posting on message boards and stuff and there would be people on the message boards it's like
4790652	4793374	Yeah, you should, like, come out to this meetup and all this stuff.
4793414	4794915	And it's like, okay, I'm 15, huh?
4795375	4799597	You know, and... You know, I can kind of see that side of it.
4800198	4804920	That sometimes the parents... If she knew what I was doing online, though, she would have punched me in the face.
4807515	4808095	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4828524	4848442	I feel that a lot of people will pretend to be high and mighty by saying that a TV or a console should not be a babysitter, but it's a privilege for a kid to have two adults that are in the same household as them, invested in raising them, and sometimes if they have to work full-time jobs to do what's necessary to run that household,
4849142	4854964	A console or TV will be a babysitter for four or five hours a day, and I don't really think that that's negligent to do so.
4855484	4865308	And even if the parents had taken measures to lock down that kind of stuff, it doesn't necessarily mean the 10-year-old doesn't know how to crack their parents' password and lock it themselves.
4865608	4868089	Like, they're not idiots at 10.
4868829	4873572	I guess that's true, you know, but don't fucking buy him an Xbox Live subscription.
4874993	4878475	Do not buy a 10-year-old an Xbox Live subscription, ever.
4879516	4882958	And if you're going to get one for yourself, password lock it if you know there's a kid in the house.
4882998	4883819	It's dangerous.
4883859	4891384	Yeah, and if the kid still cracks the password, there shouldn't be icky 20-plus, 30-plus-year-old pedos creeping on him.
4891684	4895927	Well, that's still absolutely true, and I'm still in support of that, but I'm just saying, you know.
4897586	4899527	Everybody needs to accept some responsibility here.
4900907	4901207	Alright.
4902067	4903588	Anyhow, let's move on.
4903948	4906228	Let's move on to a time when Xbox Live didn't exist.
4906329	4908429	We didn't have these complicated situations.
4910510	4912610	Although the Nintendo did still babysit us a little bit.
4912630	4916571	Or in the case of this week's Classic Game of the Week, an old computer would babysit.
4916591	4917632	Okay, so here's the deal.
4917672	4918832	DarkSakura's not here tonight.
4919232	4921653	So this is DarkSakura's Classic Game of the Week, but we're taking over!
4922964	4923324	DarkSakura
4940445	4940765	Why?
4941386	4943448	Because I picked a game from the Commodore 64.
4943808	4945530	That's right.
4945590	4950955	The game I've picked tonight as tonight's classic game of the week is Impossible Mission.
4950975	4959584	I don't know if anybody ever remembers this game, but this game was awesome because it was one of the first games ever to use a voice synthesizer.
4959944	4960765	And so here you go.
4960865	4963808	Here's what you would hear when you would start Impossible Mission.
4965367	4966851	Another visitor.
4967593	4968675	Stay awhile.
4969618	4971442	Stay forever.
4972708	4973449	Stay wild, stay forever
4996071	4996932	Can we even hear the thing?
4997632	5001474	By the way, the sound effects and stuff in this game is very ambient.
5002454	5003154	And there's no music.
5003334	5006236	There's no music, so you just have some very ambient noises.
5006296	5007596	I'll try to turn it up a little bit there.
5008096	5010217	Alright, so anyway, here is the deal.
5010377	5016680	In Impossible Mission, not to be confused with Mission Impossible, wink wink, nudge nudge, the big show from the 60s.
5016860	5021962	In Impossible Mission, you played a secret agent, not to be confused with 007.
5023303	5030369	that is trying to stop an evil genius, Elvin Attenbender, is tampering with national security computers.
5030709	5041378	So you go into the stronghold, and you race against the clock to search for pieces, which in turn will make a password while you avoid deadly, electrocuting, face-eating robots.
5041898	5043960	Okay, they don't eat your face, but they will electrocute you.
5044501	5044781	All right.
5045501	5050325	And you will sometimes fall down bottomless pits, and all you'll hear is, ahhh!
5054557	5054777	Anyhow.
5054817	5056218	We got the chorus going on now.
5057118	5064580	Once you finally put the password pieces together, you'll put the completed password in the main control room door, and that's where you find the evil professor.
5065120	5066641	Where do you find password pieces?
5066841	5068241	In the furniture, of course.
5068701	5070062	You search the furniture in the rooms.
5070102	5072803	You might find lift resets and snoozes in the rooms as well.
5073203	5078404	You also will have a room where you can get more lift resets and snoozes from doing a musical puzzle.
5079305	5079665	There you go.
5080385	5081025	Thank you for watching!
5099012	5102975	Rogue apparently was an early inspiration for the randomized room layouts.
5103255	5104476	The designer cited Rogue.
5104496	5108859	Do you remember the old, old-ass Rogue game that was on like terminals back in the day?
5108879	5112422	I don't know that I've played an original Rogue, but I've played a million Roguelikes.
5113078	5114979	Oh yeah, well then you kind of know what the deal is there.
5116639	5118640	Here is the speech that is in the game.
5119280	5123121	There is the death scream, which can also be heard in Beachhead 2.
5123501	5125361	They recycled the death scream.
5126422	5128002	There's another visitor.
5128282	5129142	Stay a while.
5129322	5130263	Stay forever.
5130723	5134504	And then there's also, destroy him, my robots.
5134864	5137945	Which happens in the very first room you walk into in Never Again, correct?
5138665	5139565	It's a randomized room.
5139805	5140065	Really?
5141065	5144826	And then there's also, when the game is over, there's a laugh.
5145306	5148527	And then if you find him, he'll say, no, no, no.
5148667	5153508	And then there's a lady voice that says, mission accomplished, congratulations.
5153548	5154828	And that's all the speech in the game.
5154969	5161190	That's all you can fit on one of those freaking five and a quarter floppy disks that is like bigger than terabyte hard drives these days.
5162708	5163749	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5181409	5184371	You get six hours to beat the game, 36 puzzle pieces.
5184531	5188214	Every time you die, 10 minutes are deducted from the total time.
5189135	5192057	This game was ported like mad.
5192817	5203164	It was on the Apple II, the Atari 7800, the ZX Spectrum, the Acorn Electron, the BBC Micro, the Amstrad CPC, the NES, and the Sega Master System.
5204145	5205627	Not all of them had speech though.
5206447	5213634	Get this, the 7800 version on the NTSC platforms had a bug that made the game impossible to win.
5214495	5216437	So it really was impossible mission.
5216497	5219020	Somebody took the game name too literally there.
5219280	5222403	Looks like level 30 syndrome started a bit earlier than we thought.
5222423	5222683	Uh-huh.
5223884	5230447	There was a sequel called Impossible Mission 2 in 1988 with new traps and items and also a bigger stronghold.
5231088	5235550	There was a 3D sequel planned for Epyx's Handy System.
5235910	5238191	I don't know if you guys know, but Epyx was going to launch their own system.
5238691	5240512	It eventually became the Atari Lynx.
5241433	5242834	So that didn't happen.
5244014	5250339	Impossible Mission 2025 came out in 1994 for the Amiga, which was kind of the similar gameplay.
5251500	5252881	Impossible Mission did show up later.
5252961	5259647	In 2004, it was on the Commodore 64 Direct-to-TV, and it was on the Nintendo Game Boy Advance in 2004, and the Sony PSP in 2008.
5260407	5260748	Get that.
5264030	5271454	This game is also available on the Wii Virtual Console, but only in Europe, because the Commodore 64 was a fucking huge deal in Europe.
5271494	5273355	It was kind of big here, but it was huge in Europe.
5273775	5275816	April 11, 2008 is when it came out there.
5276597	5282240	This is one of those games, this is the game in my opinion, and I'm obviously very age-biased myself.
5282760	5292111	and that it's gotten better with time because when I was young playing on a Commodore 64 I was just like running, jumping and collecting these random numbers and other things.
5292291	5294093	You had no idea what the fuck you were doing, right?
5294133	5298197	I can ride lifts up and down and side to side and sometimes not even that and couldn't always figure it out.
5299118	5301381	But now that I've grown up and matured
5302057	5306078	I actually understand what's going on and what I have to do, and this game is freaking hard!
5306818	5313420	But it's a good challenge and it's worth revisiting and finally starting to get played again.
5313520	5329063	I still have not beaten the game to this day, but knowing what I have to do, going back and doing it with the original Commodore 64 version under emulation, I've been making an active try to do it and come up short so far, but I've still had a lot of fun doing it.
5330134	5333416	TigerClaw in our chatroom says, Sky, do you think Impossible Mission could ever get remade?
5333496	5344901	Well, I mean, we do have the Game Boy and the PSP ones, but... Yeah, the Wii version and all those modern consoles, I would call it a remake because it's not just like improved graphics.
5344981	5349023	A lot of aspects of the game change.
5349083	5358628	Like, you don't pick up numbers, you pick up puzzle pieces that you have to rotate and put into place that form like a map, security code, something or other, right?
5359048	5360689	Got pissed off at the game and I stopped playing it.
5361069	5364351	It's technically already happened, but not in a significant way.
5364631	5370375	I think there would be a brilliant use on, like, let's say Xbox Live Arcade or PlayStation Network of multiplayer.
5370435	5374117	Can you imagine if you and three other people all attacked the same citadel at the same time?
5374857	5391048	and like you could maybe see the shadows of the other players as they're exploring and then you know I think this would be a great competitive game especially with the randomization element in it and everything I think for like old school fans I think there's really something untapped here that the developers didn't do when they made these other ports
5391567	5393307	for some very obvious reasons perhaps.
5393347	5396228	You should be giving me the rights to do this franchise.
5396728	5402189	Even though I know nothing about game or programming games, I think that wouldn't that be a fantastic game on Xbox Live?
5402209	5404570	You could like do multiplayer, co-op and competitive.
5405270	5407250	You do co-op where you're both collecting puzzle pieces.
5407810	5409731	I think this is a great franchise.
5410011	5419193	One person manning the computer and controlling some room elements and the other person swiftly dodging the robots at a moment's notice and scanning the furniture and everything else.
5419213	5420613	A lot of potential, absolutely.
5420953	5427163	Well, there it is, your classic game of the week for the Commodore 64, where it all started, although it's available in a shitload of systems after that.
5427283	5429126	Impossible Mission.
5430007	5431690	Commodore 64, your classic game of the week.
5432051	5433333	Ha ha, DarkSakura.
5434254	5434715	Ha ha.
5436434	5439436	took your other classic game and just threw it out the window.
5439876	5441077	Nah, she'll bring it back next week.
5441117	5441637	I know she will.
5442118	5442518	It's okay.
5442658	5445840	Considering what the game is, it would just float to safety.
5447121	5448281	There's your hint for next week.
5448642	5448882	All right.
5449642	5452224	That's going to do it for part A of Orange Lounge Radio, but don't go anywhere.
5452244	5453945	We've got plenty more to come in the second half of the show.
5454005	5455927	We're going to talk a little more about PAX East.
5455947	5457728	We're expecting to get a phone call a little later in the show.
5457748	5460250	We're going to talk about PAX East with some of the OLR listeners that was there.
5460550	5461911	I'm not ignoring PAX East.
5461971	5464393	I just, I live in California and didn't fly out there this year.
5464513	5467556	So I'm sure there's lots that's going to be said about PAX East.
5467836	5475662	We do have more news, your Fugle Question of the Week, more phone calls, and plenty more when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio right after this.
5482896	5491378	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio Live on this April the 8th of 2012 with the 453rd episode of our show.
5491698	5497999	A little weird tonight because we're not missing just one but two co-hosts, but we have two fantastic co-hosts sitting in tonight.
5498039	5500439	We have Alan, of course, and Jason filling in.
5500539	5500959	That's me.
5501039	5507940	I promised you guys could talk about some of your side projects because you guys don't just co-host here, but you both now have your own regular podcast that you do.
5508521	5509281	Jason, we'll start with you.
5509321	5511001	You mentioned you do an Apple-related thing.
5511229	5527966	Yeah, there's a network of nerd topic goodness called Stack Exchange, and myself, I'm quite personally vested with a couple of others on their Apple topic site called Ask Different, and so myself and two others started up the Ask Different podcast, and we've been going since...
5529668	5532531	I want to say last summer, but suddenly that feels wrong for some reason.
5532591	5535013	But AskDifferent podcast, pretty easy to search for.
5535554	5537215	AskDifferent.com is the site.
5537876	5543702	And there's links to blog, chat, finding us, finding the site itself, and all that content there.
5543942	5544362	Pretty simple.
5544822	5547303	I'm assuming that's a little pun on the think different.
5547423	5550163	Yeah, and that was the name chosen for the site.
5550183	5555385	The highest voted name to actually call the site.
5556305	5560746	I could rant for like 30 minutes on how we came to that name, but I'll spare all you guys because it's not the topic.
5560806	5562346	And you really do have a great radio voice.
5562386	5564527	I'm not just saying that because you're here, but I mean, it's convenient.
5564607	5566407	But you do have a great radio voice.
5566447	5569608	I can only imagine the Ask Different podcast is great.
5569628	5570008	Yeah.
5570900	5575541	It's not as exciting and hilarious as this show is, at least 99% of the time.
5575601	5577502	Sometimes we get in a good pun.
5577562	5578182	That's okay.
5578222	5579442	This show can be pretty boring, too.
5579482	5580042	No, I'm kidding.
5580062	5581103	This show's always amazing.
5581183	5581463	Always.
5582283	5589205	Alan, you now, in the time that you have been your last guest co-hosting on this program, you now have your own podcast, right?
5589225	5591065	Yes, I've branched out of the OLR network.
5591805	5593846	How very dare I. How very dare you.
5594807	5597650	I'm surprised you weren't banned from this program, actually.
5597670	5602114	I had to sleep on the couch for a week, so don't pretend you didn't make me do that.
5602855	5607560	I am on a podcast called Fabulous Flames, and it is a World of Warcraft podcast.
5608181	5611464	Maybe, I guess, a competitor of Horde House?
5611484	5611845	Yeah.
5615183	5619805	I was invited to be on it because the host was a fan of what I had to say on Horde House.
5619885	5620826	So there's three of us.
5621586	5625328	And it's just, I guess, World of Warcraft from a male point of view.
5625649	5627410	I don't really know what the gimmick is.
5627930	5629811	It's a gay WoW podcast.
5629851	5630931	That's what the gimmick is.
5630951	5636975	And Fabulous Flames is an actual spell from an encounter from this latest expansion.
5637155	5642598	And it's the gay dragon that was originally supposed to sound like Paul Lynn from Match Game.
5643138	5645259	and Blizzard cut his voice acting.
5645619	5647739	Our listeners are too young to get that reference, honey.
5647899	5650900	So Blizzard cut his voice acting going, no, this is not good.
5650960	5656222	So we're joking that we're the gay dragons and don't just stand in the flames basking them.
5656542	5663684	So it's World of Warcraft discussion and you can find us at Fabulous Flames on Twitter and FabulousFlames.com or on iTunes.
5663844	5667525	How very dare you work that tagline into the show.
5667845	5669906	One gay dragons, two talking dragons?
5671747	5674029	Is my lack of wow biting me somewhere here?
5674269	5676050	It's the Twilight Dragon Twins.
5676110	5677171	It's a brother and sister.
5677611	5679733	And the brother is on fire.
5680433	5683396	So I've often... Obviously, I have a side project.
5683436	5688580	I do not just Orange Lawn Studio, but I have a podcast about the World of Warcraft called The Best Little Horde House in Azeroth.
5688920	5692703	And our tagline is, it's all things World of Warcraft, but never too seriously.
5693763	5695485	So, you know, that's what we've got.
5696465	5697967	And I often get asked the question...
5698667	5702191	Is it weird that you and your boyfriend are on competing podcasts?
5703012	5707497	And I'm like, no, because I support all independent podcasts.
5707837	5710680	And that's what I've been preaching on Orange Launch Radio for years.
5711081	5713623	So I fucking love it that he's doing his own show.
5713944	5714504	It's great.
5714684	5715165	I love it.
5718382	5719083	FABULOUS FLAMES
5740742	5743583	I have all these names for fabulous vibes.
5743623	5744924	I call them the fabulous flops.
5745724	5747526	It's my favorite name for them.
5748586	5750727	Anyhow, there you go.
5751828	5755170	Honestly, I really do think it's great.
5755290	5760213	Most people I know that listen to podcasts listen at work, and they've got plenty of time to listen to plenty of shows.
5760853	5767758	I would rather somebody be listening to an independent podcast than some of that crap that certain websites that won't be named produce.
5767778	5768298	We do try to be funny.
5768678	5769859	Yeah, you try.
5769879	5771820	I'm just kidding.
5772620	5773860	I had to dig in one more.
5773940	5774341	Come on.
5775141	5775401	All right.
5775921	5776602	Anyhow, so there you go.
5777702	5779743	Also, I want to do shout-outs for PAX East.
5780103	5787507	Since we're giving other shows shout-outs, I do want to say I heard little bits and pieces of what the B-Team, which is one of the other shows on the All Games Network, did.
5787867	5789348	They were live at PAX East.
5790268	5791189	and did some good shows.
5791429	5792570	So check that out.
5792670	5798235	I also know Electric Sisterhood, which is also on the All Games Network, did a show while they were there.
5798295	5802018	I don't think it was live, but maybe it was.
5802098	5802658	I don't remember.
5802718	5803199	Sorry, girls.
5803619	5808423	But they did one, and it will be on their podcast feed and on the network this week for sure.
5808483	5813487	And I think I heard Ranma, who calls in this show all the time and will be on the show tonight, guested on it.
5813608	5816310	So I'm glad to see the All Games Network, big happy family.
5816670	5817591	getting together at PAX.
5817711	5822396	I will say the one year we did the all games thing at PAX Prime was a great year.
5823057	5830485	Oh man, that was like one of my favorite cons ever was that PAX Prime 2008 when all the all games people were there and we were broadcasting.
5830505	5831145	It was a great year.
5832166	5855594	but I did go to PAX East the first year a couple years ago and had a good time so I was sad I couldn't go this year but you know there's only so much money and you know I I spent a lot of it going to Disneyland what can you do but I am gonna try and go to PAX Prime this year if nothing else all right Rob advertised real far advertising the all games network never saw that coming well what do you want me to advertise
5857458	5858800	I have no good response to that.
5860361	5867589	I was going to say something bitchy about one of the corporate networks, but I'm not going to go there and I'm just going to ask that we go for some rapid fire news.
5868270	5869912	So, you know what's funny about that?
5870813	5874077	I'm on a loaner laptop right now and I just pulled the power cord out.
5874637	5880438	So I can tell you the first story, purely from recollection, is that Diablo 3 was finally dated for mid-May.
5881779	5883719	What's the next question for the Great Dungeon Crawl?
5884079	5884619	Torchlight.
5884880	5885320	When is it?
5885660	5886520	They haven't said yet.
5886680	5887060	Soon.
5887220	5887580	Soon.
5887760	5891141	Shortly after Diablo 3, which is still soon, but not soon enough.
5892361	5894322	You want to give me the headlines of the next two?
5894402	5898023	Because I can... Oh, what?
5898783	5899163	There you go.
5901472	5907975	Uh, Theatrhythm Final Fantasy finally dated for the, what is that, midsummer, July 3rd?
5908195	5909236	Mm-hmm.
5909376	5913217	Game was actually completely off my radar, but looking at the screenshots looks fun.
5914498	5926383	I did get a particular amount of amusement of the fact that Cloudstripe's face was completely obscured in the one screenshot I did see by the target exceeding the, or the note exceeding the target zone, whatever the particular vocabulary is for that.
5926403	5927343	Okay.
5927923	5949171	and finally Sega says Rhythm Thief is still happening and that article unfortunately I don't have on the top of my head so while my computer starts back up can somebody save my poor dead air ass there was they were on the PAX East Sega was at PAX East and there was confirmation that Rhythm Thief is still happening this is despite all the Sega bad news we had last week
5949871	5968762	Rhythm Thief was not cancelled so it is still happening it's a 3DS rhythm action game featuring people in top hats and ties I guess they're like tap dancing on disco floors there you go alright some other rapid fire news for you guys Fallout the original not the Fallout 3 which was still really good but the original original game way back in the day
5969202	5989856	was free I say was because you missed it it was on good old games or gog.com uh it was earlier this week unfortunately if you're hearing this now though it is no longer free so why am I reporting it because I just wanted you to know what you missed out on free fallout which is a great great pc you're a pc gaming fan I know you know the fallout series um
5990556	6002161	also it's worth mentioning since we brought up GOG they threw a little shade at Steam this week they were kind of like you know when you give these games away for such a low cost it doesn't really help anyone which I thought was an interesting little dig
6004395	6007317	Yeah, but I can't imagine.
6007517	6014523	I mean, EA fucked off and did their origin store because they just want to be elitist and only sell things to their own platform.
6014583	6024790	But if a game developer is letting Steam sell a five-year-old game for $2.99, I don't think Valve is twisting their arm.
6024810	6025791	Yeah.
6026131	6031615	Uh, Zether's in our chatroom talking about the Sega stuff, saying, I hope to God we get Phantasy Star Online 2 here.
6031655	6033496	If that gets canned, I will explode.
6034176	6034737	I hear ya.
6034957	6037659	That character creator came out this week, um, overseas.
6037759	6040581	It's not, you know, but the game hasn't been announced for the US.
6040921	6046745	Cross your fingers and your toes we get an E3 announcement, because if you don't hear it at E3, it's probably not happening.
6047639	6048519	You know what is happening though?
6048559	6050000	A Civ 5 expansion.
6050100	6052261	Civilization 5 Gods and Kings.
6052901	6057323	It is going to be coming out on June 19th is the release date for that.
6058103	6059623	22nd if you're international.
6060984	6069607	There was more information announced about this at Game Developers Conference, but in case you forgot, 27 new units, 13 new buildings, 9 new wonders and civilization.
6069947	6074669	They're also going to add religion and espionage into the game and some tweaks to diplomacy.
6075209	6079152	So hopefully they'll fix some of the balancing issues that they borked in the game to begin with.
6079232	6087878	But if any of my Civ friends are listening, we're going to need to get a match going in late June after this comes out because I'm eager to revisit the game again.
6087898	6090459	But God, you know how those Civ V matches will go.
6090499	6093782	You start it at 6 o'clock in the evening and then suddenly, oh shit, it's 2 a.m.
6093822	6095143	and we just discovered railroads.
6099593	6108979	Another story this week, Epic Games, you know Epic Games, they make, well, you know, Epic Games, including Unreal and the Gears of War.
6109440	6115624	Here's the deal, they have announced, sort of, that they're doing a PC exclusive project.
6115724	6118065	It was mentioned during a PAX East panel.
6118806	6121688	The unannounced PC project is under development.
6121728	6124670	The plans are to keep the game exclusive to the PC.
6125850	6132355	So, if you were worried that Epic was all about the consoles and, I don't know, iOS games now, because that's the other big thing they did, right?
6132775	6133515	Infinity Blade.
6134096	6136918	Don't worry, a PC exclusive title is in the works.
6137758	6138759	Hmm, could be interesting.
6140240	6140420	Alan?
6143499	6155562	There has been an online petition for the game Dark Souls, the sequel to Demon's Souls, otherwise known as one of the hardest console games ever this generation.
6157082	6170786	The petition's been to bring it on to the PC platform, and Atlas has come out and said, yes, there will be a PC edition of Dark Souls, and it's called the Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition.
6172346	6176427	to which anyone that's played the game would say very much yes, you will die.
6178508	6185750	There was a lot of hype in the last few weeks about the game Journey, I believe it is, that sort of has an online element, if that's correct.
6186670	6192952	Demon's Souls was similar in that when you were fighting in these labyrinths, you would fight these ghouls that were actually other players.
6193652	6198073	And Demon's Souls has a similar mechanic, or sorry, Dark Souls has a similar mechanic
6198573	6218535	so yeah it's a very difficult game and it's coming to PC it's one of the few examples of where an online petition was a success it has over 92,000 signatures and it has exclusive bosses to the PC edition which I'm sure will be just as impossibly hard or even more so
6220557	6224139	So Dark Souls fans on PC, you're in luck.
6224939	6235723	Skyrim 1.5 patch, which I was surprised when I read this story because I've been playing on PC Skyrim 1.5 patch for a couple weeks now, is hitting 360 and PS3 this week.
6238424	6246646	and it's mostly bug fixes at least two dozen or so bug fixes that were blocking progress on certain quests.
6247727	6264751	The big deal though about patch 1.5 Skyrim is that it's adding kill moves and kill cinematic like awesome slow-mo bullet cam for projectile weapons like arrows and spells which Skyrim didn't have before and also new kill moves for melee weapons.
6265231	6272633	So now not only can you behead people, you can fry them, you can shoot arrows through their necks, and all that other stuff you saw in Shaky Cam Hunger Games.
6272893	6273073	Yes.
6274093	6280274	They fixed what it looks like when you go underwater, and it also looks like they finally fixed the Lydia bug.
6281235	6290417	Lydia's the first guard woman that you get, and when you buy a house, if you're wearing an amulet of Mara, you should be able to propose to her.
6291017	6292097	She's been bugged this whole time.
6293037	6295140	since November or whatever.
6295200	6296722	So finally they fixed the Lydia bug.
6298584	6301788	Yeah, so look for that on Xbox and PS3 this week.
6302308	6313080	Finally, Sonic 4 Episode 2, the big 2D HD resurgence of the Sonic franchise that kind of came off like a fart in an elevator.
6314061	6316363	is getting its episode two.
6317364	6318705	Everyone's like, it sounds so awesome.
6318725	6321647	And then it came out and it's no one care.
6321787	6326350	It is finally getting its episode two and it will likely be the last episode.
6326670	6329352	So they are wrapping this up really fast.
6329812	6332294	Episode of content is the way of the future.
6332814	6335756	We'll give you a part two because no one liked this shit and we don't want to make it anymore.
6336397	6337558	Thanks, Gabe Newell.
6338699	6358122	PSN version will be released on May 15th XBLA version of Sonic 4 Episode 2 will be the next day May 16th and PC and mobile versions are I guess confirmed but to be announced later yeah that's all let's go to the Fugle question of the week
6359179	6363620	Oh, no, we won't go to the Fugle Question of the Week.
6363720	6366601	One quick thing I missed in the theatrhythm story.
6367002	6369922	If you're at PAX East, you can go check out the... Oh, wait, sorry, never mind.
6370303	6370743	It's over.
6370823	6371003	Yeah.
6372043	6372543	That was a joke.
6372863	6373884	May I do the Fugle now?
6374104	6374564	Absolutely.
6381932	6385113	Every week we ask you guys a question over at Facebook or Google+.
6385273	6387554	Facebook, put them together, that's Google, that's where it comes from.
6387854	6392216	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio if you want to like us over there and Google+.
6393096	6396778	Search for Orange Lounge Radio because we don't get short URLs there.
6397558	6402640	I'll start with Google+, because the very first answer on Google+, I need to read this because it has something very important in it.
6403440	6406082	Oh, I should tell you guys what the question was.
6406802	6412926	Just like I forgot to tell you what the question was just then, I forgot to give a good question earlier in the week, so I made it really easy this week.
6412966	6414787	I said, how was your gaming week?
6415288	6420231	Shit, we all say every night how our gaming weeks were, the hosts of the show, so why shouldn't the listeners get a shot?
6420571	6421772	So how was your gaming week, listeners?
6423078	6426379	I especially said, what game are you into right now that everybody else should be playing?
6427039	6430160	So Derek H starts us off on Google+, and this is worth mentioning.
6430260	6437722	He's playing Pinball Arcade on Xbox Live Arcade, but everyone should be playing Joust on MAME as part of The Hunt.
6438322	6439843	And I totally forgot to mention this.
6440283	6442784	I'm so bad, and I had notes to myself to mention this.
6443664	6448890	Partly because I had no idea this was happening until Monday of last week, after last week's show.
6449390	6458881	But DarkTetsuya, who pretty much writes most of the articles on OrangeLaunchRadio.com at this point, it's either him or Actdeft or me publishing episodes of the show and that's it at this point.
6459401	6462164	DarkTetsuya is doing a little contest and it's called The Hunt.
6462664	6467548	And it's based off of the book Ready Player One where they kind of do something very similar.
6467588	6469190	I don't want to go into all the details.
6470191	6472913	But he's doing kind of his own spin of the competition called The Hunt.
6473333	6478798	And it involves classic video games and being able to get scores that are better than what DarkTetsuya gets.
6478878	6483082	And he doesn't really try super hard because he makes it beatable.
6483442	6485504	So right now the contest he's running is Joust.
6485544	6498577	And if you can beat a score of 39,000 something, so I think it's 39,800, you take a screen cap of it and either email it to Dark Tetsuya or you post it on Twitter and you're going to get a little copper key and some points that lead you into the next round of the competition.
6498957	6519242	so Joust is the game that they're doing right now I don't know how much longer you have to do it I'm hoping Dark Tetsuya will allow a little bit of an extension because if you weren't reading the website you may have missed or seen the Twitter you may have missed this so I'm telling you guys now if you have Joust be it in MAME or Xbox Live or whatever fire it up
6519822	6530074	get the score and go on to the next round of the competition because as I understand it right now Derek H is in the lead and well we just we can't we have to give this a competition you guys
6531414	6534016	Derek H is the guy behind the big battle and all that stuff.
6534056	6537358	So we have to give him a challenge here.
6537398	6539119	We don't want to let him just walk away with everything.
6539179	6540740	So I submitted my entry today.
6542021	6544602	And I'm going to try to play in future weeks as well.
6544743	6555629	So more information is available on OrangeLoungeRadio.com Now Derek H also wants to plug You Will Die on Xbox Live Indie Games because I get money when people buy it.
6557048	6557589	Well played.
6557669	6558630	Well, I see what you did there.
6558990	6560472	Actually, You Will Die is a fun game, though.
6560632	6562154	Like, if you like, you know, your retro shooters.
6562454	6562975	He did a good job.
6563095	6563696	I did buy it.
6564597	6569743	I bought it, like, two years ago when it first came out, so he's probably long spent the money, but I did buy it.
6570864	6575770	All right, PWK responded and said, I was at my first PAX this weekend.
6576633	6577494	Congratulations.
6578335	6579055	I hope you had fun.
6579135	6579916	I want to hear more about it.
6580657	6588303	Tony M responded and said, this is an oldie, but after Atlas recently cut the prices of their PSN downloads, I've been playing Persona 3 Portable.
6588744	6590845	It's pretty awesome if you're into JRPGs.
6591146	6596631	You know, Persona is one of the series I hear nothing but good things about, but I just, I personally haven't sat down and played it myself.
6597031	6601415	But like, I said the same thing about Mass Effect a few months ago on the show.
6601915	6604458	I haven't really played it myself, but I hear a lot of people are really into it.
6604838	6608021	So, Persona, one of these days, I'm going to sit down and play it.
6609102	6610784	Maybe that's something you could do after Mass Effect.
6610824	6611464	Play Persona.
6611484	6612725	Is that a series that interests you at all?
6613226	6614627	No, you did play it before, though, didn't you?
6614707	6620733	I have Persona 3 and 4 for PS2 that I think might still be shrink-wrapped on this show.
6620893	6621734	Ha ha ha!
6623214	6625176	Alright, let's go to Facebook and read some of the answers there.
6625817	6626938	Lots of replies on Facebook.
6626978	6633004	I can't possibly read these all, but I do want to thank you guys for taking the time to actually answer these.
6633805	6634886	Let's see, another Persona.
6635067	6638450	Austin W. says, Right now I'm really into Persona 4 on PlayStation 2.
6638991	6644356	Anyone who is a fan of JRPGs, dungeon crawlers, and the social character interaction aspect of games should check it out.
6645738	6646259	Let's see.
6647240	6658759	Going to Stan says, splitting my time between Draw Something, Angry Bird Space, Pushmo on 3DS, and more Soul Calibur 5 online, trying to show off my creative souls.
6660215	6663936	Chad C responds and says, been playing Realm of the Mad God.
6664056	6667597	It's an MMORPG shooter with 85 player groups.
6668297	6668577	What?
6669497	6670717	Free to play on your browser.
6670857	6671617	Also on Steam.
6671877	6672878	35 meg download.
6672898	6674138	8-bit graphics.
6674598	6682799	Permadeath kind of sucks when your guy you logged 30 plus hours on dies, but it's so easy to get into that it won't stop you from playing more.
6682919	6683120	What?
6683200	6684540	Permadeath in an MMO?
6684560	6685220	That's crazy.
6685800	6690683	Once you hit level 20, you start gaining fame, which allows you to buy keys to unlock more dungeons.
6691043	6692284	The final boss is Onyx.
6692424	6697527	Everyone gets teleported to his lair when all quests are completed on your realm, and someone kills 2,500 mobs.
6697967	6703891	The game isn't over when he dies, however, because you can keep gaining fame to unlock harder dungeons and get better loots.
6704491	6706673	I don't know this game, but it sounds crazy.
6707573	6710315	I keep bumping into it, but I haven't really taken the plunge myself.
6710515	6710675	Huh.
6711576	6722365	Now, you knew there were going to be some people talking about Xenoblade this week, so we have Barry M. Xenoblade Chronicles on the Wii is an amazing JRPG game, much in the vein of Final Fantasy XII meets White Knight Chronicles.
6722705	6725588	I think that's exactly how I described it when I first reviewed it, actually.
6726449	6731633	Also playing Ragnarok Odyssey on Vita, Kid Icarus Uprising on 3DS, and Tales of Grace's F on PlayStation 3.
6731673	6733695	This is a great year for RPG fans.
6735516	6741682	Carlos M says, I'm halfway through Dragon Age 2 on my 360 and 56 coins and to draw something.
6742803	6745024	I like that those two games are like on the same level there.
6745085	6745685	It's awesome.
6746506	6748568	Zether simply responds, Xenoblade.
6748908	6750009	Everyone probably knows why.
6751250	6755874	And DarkSakura would kick me if I didn't say, I randomly started playing Portal 2 again.
6756094	6756695	I know, I know.
6756755	6758036	I should be playing Mass Effect.
6758576	6759197	Yes, you should.
6760711	6762532	I'm going to read this comment from Unfolded Raptor.
6762572	6763752	It's a long one, but it's good.
6764873	6771516	This past week, the blockbuster video in the city I live in was going out of business and had a liquidation sale and had to sell everything.
6771836	6775958	So I found a whole bunch of really good PlayStation 3 games for $8 each.
6776458	6781180	I ended up buying 15 that I never played yet and probably won't for a while.
6781220	6785902	I'm not going to read all these, but like Twisted Metal, Demon's Souls, Deus Ex, Bulletstorm.
6785922	6786703	There's a ton in here.
6787503	6788224	Grand total of $173.
6789905	6795550	For those games, it's a steal considering at Walmart and even at the Evil G, the lowest some of these get is around $20.
6796751	6799393	I highly suggest people play Borderlands if they haven't yet.
6799673	6800474	It's a ton of fun.
6800814	6803916	Other than that, I've been dedicating myself to Ninja Gaiden 3 and have almost finished it.
6804337	6807359	I'm loving that as well and I don't see why all the hate for it.
6807679	6809681	Sometimes I think that people forget how to have fun.
6810885	6811706	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6827159	6832662	California props it up a lot better than some of these more sparse western They all went under already years ago.
6832762	6834963	Redbox took over years ago here.
6835283	6838284	I can only think of where one blockbuster even is.
6838484	6840905	There's one over on Folsom below that I know of.
6840965	6842266	Keep your eye on it for it to go under.
6842766	6844267	Well, I'll do that.
6845789	6847010	It's right next door to Papa Murphy's.
6847910	6850092	It's like the only pizza chain I'll eat anymore.
6851453	6852374	Alright, there you go.
6852414	6853815	That was our Fugle Question of the Week.
6854515	6855596	Thank you guys for responding.
6855636	6861201	Sorry I didn't read them all, but since it was such an easy question, there was more there than ever before.
6862542	6863082	Let's move on.
6863462	6864363	Jason, more news.
6865464	6869767	Electronic Arts has been voted the worst American company ever.
6870008	6871529	Okay, not ever, but just in...
6872730	6875852	2012.
6872950	6875852	So I guess it's actually for 2011 considering the year just started.
6876573	6876873	Whatever.
6877033	6878014	Beyond that.
6878034	6882338	The Consumers holds an annual tournament to determine the most despised American companies.
6882778	6887342	Nominations are put to a vote and the ultimate winner is crowned the worst company of the year.
6887682	6888403	Electronic Arts.
6888983	6890365	Congratulations!
6890946	6901118	In a poll that took over 250,000 votes, EA beat out the Bank of America for its greed and treatment of consumers with a comfortable 64% lead.
6901479	6904803	Hell hath no fury like a pack of scorned gamers.
6905859	6913809	I don't think EA has ever double withdrawn someone's mortgage payment, and I know people on BFA that have had that happen, so I'm a little skeptical.
6915110	6921037	I know the study's been going on for a while, but with the timing of the Mass Effect 3 ending, Wank, this seems really...
6921698	6923160	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6941338	6945180	that mostly comes down to everything that happened in Mass Effect.
6945700	6947881	And granted, there's the DLC stuff.
6947901	6954923	I mean, I'm not letting EA off easy here, but it's not like they're Capcom.
6955263	6961466	I think EA's kind of taken the burden for everything that everybody hates with the gaming industry right now.
6961986	6963446	I think it's kind of said in that statement.
6963686	6967728	But then what also cracks me up is the people on the consumerist that are like,
6968308	6969690	Fucking gamers!
6970111	6972194	Fucking gamers ruining this poll!
6972575	6977102	Fucking Bank of America is the fucking evilest company in the world!
6977382	6979906	What the fuck is wrong with gamers?
6980127	6983051	Obviously gamers are too poor to own a house, and it's like...
6983772	6989456	You guys, internet polls are really fucking serious business, everybody.
6990417	6992218	Look at your lives, look at your choices.
6992738	6999143	You are all rabble-rabbling over an internet poll on some website.
7001266	7002006	We ain't done shit.
7028436	7030057	The rest of this article is a pretty good read.
7030077	7030917	I'll leave it verbatim.
7031617	7046482	To those who might sneer at something as non-essential as a video game company winning the worst company in American vote, it's that exact kind of attitude that allows people to ignore the complaints as companies like EA to nickel and dime consumers to death, argues the site.
7046883	7053745	For years, while movies and music became more affordable and publishers piled on bonus content or multiple modes of delivery,
7055205	7061451	or multiple modes of delivery as added value to entice customers to buy, video games have continued to be priced like premium goods.
7061912	7068758	For its exploitation of the downloadable content model, the consumerist will be sending EA a little golden poo as a trophy.
7069118	7076786	The poo is usually presented on a red pillow, but this year the company is sending a choice of colors, mocking the controversial Mass Effect 3 ending.
7078067	7079208	Sounds like the Razzies.
7079429	7079709	Sorry.
7080950	7091481	As gratuitous as EA's DLC is, I can't help feeling that it's not quite as bad as illegal foreclosures or some of the other scummy things the companies in the running did.
7092002	7092782	There you go, though.
7093023	7095165	The internet hath spoken.
7096266	7097768	Also, hath was my addition.
7097808	7099049	It said has, but there you go.
7100669	7106652	And I loved EA put out some response that was very like, we don't give a fuck.
7106832	7109973	Like it was very much like all this money on our naked bodies.
7110553	7111274	We don't care.
7111494	7112494	It's so amazing.
7112614	7121558	No, it was very like, well, I guess Halliburton and Exxon and all of them are really happy that they didn't win the award this year.
7122538	7146573	and then PopCap put out a statement that was like you fucking designed quality games for 30 years I'm paraphrasing clearly you fucking I don't think PopCap would put it that way but it was basically you fucking designed games for 30 years that are quality games and try to make the internet happy and see where it gets you but in my opinion that statement as much as I love PopCap I love him a lot but that statement
7147833	7162285	they need to step away from the Borg hive mind that they're starting to become a part of because that's not the reason why EA won this award look at the trends that EA has been starting look at the things that people don't like EA invented the online pass EA you know
7163486	7166549	Obviously, this whole Mass Effect thing, they're taking some of the brunt on that.
7167130	7171373	EA's... New sports games every year with no discernible difference.
7171453	7173455	And they have the exclusive contract for the NFL.
7173475	7179501	It's probably the driving force behind trying to lock out used gamers in the next gaming cycle.
7179561	7180902	You know they want that to happen.
7181202	7182123	Look at Origin.
7183304	7184365	Oh, God, in Origin.
7185286	7185426	Yeah.
7186245	7207428	not wanting to play nice with other gaming companies they refuse basically to play by the normal rules of Xbox Live and we're like either we get to build our own infrastructure or we're not putting our games out on your system and kind of using that muscle Mass Effect 3 isn't on Steam and you know that it would sell there exactly so anyway enjoy your golden poo
7209080	7211261	Internet polls are very serious business, clearly.
7211661	7214202	Now, there's an interesting follow-up to all this stuff.
7214282	7222724	It isn't directly a follow-up to the same story, but there's always going to be that guy that asks, what about all the good things EA did?
7223525	7227486	And to be fair, EA had a couple big stories this week that were some good news.
7227706	7228906	So let's cover them.
7229467	7233548	One of them, which I think all of you have got to be aware of by now, but it is out there,
7234788	7239489	They have announced that there will be Mass Effect 3 Extended Cut.
7240550	7244811	Mass Effect 3 DLC Extended Cut is coming out.
7244931	7246491	It's going to be coming out this summer.
7246992	7251093	It is going to be providing a more fleshed out experience for their fans.
7251933	7254594	It's going to bring closure to the ending.
7255174	7259015	Is there a nice PC way of saying we're going to fix the goddamn ending then?
7259095	7259395	Fine.
7259995	7262877	Here's the big thing about it that I gotta admit even caught me by surprise.
7263097	7263757	It's gonna be free.
7264798	7268960	It's gonna be free through April of 2014 or something like that.
7269040	7280386	And even then, BioWare said they only end dated it because EA has a policy on free DLC has to be end dated and they won't ever charge for it if they can get away with it.
7280672	7303984	and it's free because it is not an addition of playable content or missions it is literally you restore a save before the final encounter before all of the expository narrative ending cinematic crap and that visually that you watch is expanded upon so it's free because it's additional content but it's not playable
7305575	7306096	Wall of Text
7328634	7328955	I don't know.
7348789	7352632	Well, it's not a new ending, which is what people are demanding.
7352652	7355073	They're like, throw the shit that you put in the game out.
7355514	7357475	Give us something completely different.
7357535	7358276	But they won't do that.
7358296	7362058	Bioware's like, no, this is our artistic point of view.
7362619	7365861	So it's not a different ending and it's not any new ending choices.
7365921	7367782	They are just fleshing out what's already there.
7368062	7368243	Yeah.
7368683	7370264	Trying to explain it more or what have you.
7370888	7378311	So in a way, it's kind of like saying, well, it's very metaphorical and up to your imagination and you didn't get it.
7378591	7382233	So if you didn't get it, then here's we're going to throw you a bone.
7382573	7384854	So what do you think about the fact that the Internet got their way?
7387352	7388092	Well, they did and they didn't.
7388653	7390393	I mean, they're getting something else.
7391014	7393355	I'm legit surprised they're doing it for free.
7393455	7398237	And I said a few weeks ago on the show, I said, if they don't put it out for free, then they're just assholes.
7398477	7400218	And to my surprise, they're doing it for free.
7400278	7404380	So I have to stand by what I said, and that is that it's hard to complain about this.
7404920	7415365	I feel that they only really did this because their analysts or whatever saw evidence of an actual fiscal impact with the fact that Amazon was accepting Mass Effect 3 returns as a defective product.
7416872	7445436	I know that's really cynical and pessimistic it's nice that they're throwing the fandom a bone but if EA has the final say this is just damage control to say that they attempted something even if fandom still hates it and I think that their hands were forced because they could possibly lose money off of the degree of butthurt that the fandom was showing so as far as the fact that them getting their way, eh
7447512	7448033	Final Fantasy VII
7463314	7489151	right of course no game will ever be as hyped up or as anticipated as Final Fantasy 7 was but we kind of just had to eat shit and deal with it it was kind of a jank ending we didn't really have the outlet or resources to freak out on a company like this but what happened to Yuffie Yuffie and Vincent what do you mean what happened they weren't even there exactly all right
7490073	7492915	I think a lot of people probably already made up their mind on this DLC, though.
7493316	7494336	Did you have anything to say, Jason?
7495217	7500941	Jason doesn't play Mass Effect, so... I will probably get around to the series eventually, but not yet.
7501342	7501942	Completely missed it.
7502682	7507543	Well, here's something that impacts Mass Effect and some other Bioware games.
7507603	7509784	It's something Bioware is kind of known for.
7509904	7516105	And Bioware obviously tells these very deep stories and sometimes romance is an option in these stories.
7516166	7521787	And Bioware has been in many ways a pioneer for any type of relationship you want.
7522087	7525488	Meaning if you want to be in a straight relationship or if you want to be in a gay relationship.
7526048	7543935	and they're starting to get some pushback for that and EA is EA who owns Bioware is kind of the target of all this there is an anti-gay letter writing campaign going on right now EA's received several thousand letters objecting to same-sex relationships in their games
7545315	7552278	The letters are being sent to a variety of senior leaders at EA, threatening to boycott EA games until it changes its policy.
7553478	7560561	EA is standing by their games, saying they will continue to include LGBT characters in their games as options.
7561341	7567926	Every one of EA's games includes ESRB content descriptors, so it's hard to believe anyone is surprised by the content.
7568227	7571529	This isn't about protecting children, it's about political harassment.
7571829	7574932	That's from EA's chief spokesperson, Jeff Brown.
7575492	7582818	Obviously, Mass Effect 3 allows you to do man, woman, man, man, woman, woman, woman, alien, shit.
7582858	7585260	You can do whatever you want in Mass Effect 3.
7586821	7599975	Mass Effect 1 was originally going to have same gender pairings, but with Dragon Age Origins coming out on the horizon, which had a more involved relationship system, they cut that content out and let Dragon Age Origins set that precedent.
7601037	7607664	And Mass Effect 1, sorry to interrupt, took a lot of heat from conservative funding groups for having sex at all.
7608979	7638685	and many people haven't even seen the scene which isn't like it's not that much more than you'd see on an episode of like Nip Tuck or something I mean for real anyhow Star Wars The Old Republic is going to be having same sex relationships it's been reported and some people are not happy with that because they don't they only see it as Star Wars like oh that movie I loved in 1978 it's gonna get the homos we can't have that Vader ain't no homo of course it almost had incest slightly so
7639013	7640514	Although that is complete, right?
7640854	7642035	Although that is complete.
7642555	7643936	Incest is a-okay.
7645317	7647739	But heaven forbid Vader be a homo.
7649099	7650440	Which isn't even how it works.
7650841	7655523	Star Wars The Old Republic takes place thousands of years before the movies and all that.
7655563	7656504	It's completely different.
7656664	7659326	And it should be noted, same-sex relationships aren't in the game yet.
7660106	7663569	It's been noted for a future patch it will be in the game.
7664669	7671473	Um, the letters are coming from Florida, the, where the Florida Family Association is at.
7672273	7674274	And, again, EA is standing by it.
7674534	7677736	But, I mean, they're doing these, it's clearly a form letter.
7678056	7683839	And if you look at the form letters, like, people will handwrite messages on them that say, like, remember, like, look at this one.
7684159	7685520	There's a handwritten message here.
7685540	7686300	You'll get a kick out of this.
7687241	7689282	Uh, thank you, remember Sodom.
7689902	7690942	And then it's signed.
7691122	7693324	I had a friend who turned into salt last week, so...
7694665	7697227	That shit is real and you will not minimize that.
7698528	7700529	That still happens.
7700589	7701670	Can I read the hate mail here?
7702590	7713717	Dear Mr. Rickitello, it was troubling to learn that Bioware and Electronic Arts were pressured into committing to add LGBT content to Star Wars video games.
7714518	7715799	Pressured by who?
7716920	7718901	They always announced it was going to be there.
7721644	7735135	I am also concerned that BioWare employees state in postings at SWOTOR.com that they have been censoring, deleting, and banning forum members for expressing opposing views about including homosexual content in the games children play.
7736196	7736916	Guess what?
7737296	7741400	On a person's private forum, the First Amendment does not exist.
7742581	7760778	for example if you're a guest in my home and you start talking like you know imagine if we invite somebody over let's say Jason's our guest we invite Jason over into our house and Jason says you know I really hate faggots and I don't know how you and Alan can be faggots together what's gonna happen we're gonna throw him out right
7761761	7762041	Yeah.
7780848	7789417	The overwhelming number of players on Star Wars games is children who do not need to be forced as a captured audience to participate in homosexual content.
7789437	7791860	30-year-old children living in their parents' basements.
7791920	7793541	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
7793722	7799628	Again, if you're letting your child play an MMO unsupervised... They're not getting that $14.99 a month themselves.
7800148	7801530	Someone's credit card's involved.
7803852	7811580	We ask that you please adhere to your long-term policy of omitting and steering clear of this type of advocacy representation in your games.
7811761	7812101	What?
7812962	7814043	EA had a policy?
7814884	7815244	No.
7816145	7821451	Please do not include LGBT content in Star Wars video games that will impact so many children.
7821791	7822212	Thank you.
7822272	7823093	Remember Sodom.
7826357	7829541	I mean, the facts are just being distorted terribly.
7830482	7839715	I mean, this is... Here's the thing about this, though, is that you know these people don't fucking play video games because video games altogether are the goddamn devil.
7839916	7840016	Yep.
7841750	7844991	So there's no real boycott happening here.
7845031	7846271	This is all for show.
7846612	7847692	It's all for press.
7847752	7848792	It's all for show.
7849192	7858115	It's just like those idiots that get out there at the funerals that say God hates fags and you're burning in hell because America embraces fags.
7858175	7864337	Mr. Rogers is burning in hell because America's a fag-loving country and all this.
7864437	7869759	I hate that I'm using that word so much tonight, but unfortunately I see it in these protests and things like that.
7870861	7873028	And it's just, they do it what?
7873088	7873710	For attention.
7875578	7895286	For those that remember, I know this isn't all that similar, but when Nipplegate happened with Janet Jackson at the Super Bowl, the FCC came out and said that for all the thousands of complaints that they got, it was some random group that was made up of 20 icky, old, creepy, old white dudes that just had a form letter and they spammed the shit out of the FCC.
7895686	7903149	So the fact that they're getting as many complaints isn't really representative of how the public feels because these are just
7903849	7909477	Really isolated groups telling that they're following to send this form letter dozens of times and that adds up.
7910778	7916125	It's just people making a fuss because they have nothing better to do with their lives.
7916706	7921933	This is what they choose to do instead of going out into their community and choosing to do some good.
7923223	7926685	because what Alan and I have is so threatening.
7927665	7930846	There is no gay agenda because we're either at the bar or the gym.
7930906	7933247	We don't have time to do anything.
7933407	7934048	Stop it.
7935928	7937169	Anyway.
7937289	7938790	I love that they scanned this in.
7938830	7939370	It's signed.
7939450	7940190	I can't read that name.
7940230	7941471	Is that Homa Johnson?
7942211	7945052	No, Homa J. Lorne.
7945393	7946413	Homa J. Lorne.
7948194	7950995	Dear Homa J. Lorne, shut the fuck up.
7958863	7963065	Anyhow, props to EA at least for standing by this whole thing.
7963966	7964646	Because you know what?
7964686	7965467	I gotta say this.
7966827	7971270	Even though I haven't played Mass Effect 3 myself yet, I spoiled myself and looked at some of the stuff on YouTube.
7971650	7973571	I've looked at all the different Saromat scenes.
7973631	7978954	I've looked at the female-female, I've looked at the male-female, I've looked at the male-male relationships.
7978994	7985458	And I gotta tell you, the male-male relationship, one in particular they do in the game, is so...
7986358	8012666	well done it's it's kind of refreshing to see that it's a relationship that's not about the bar or the gym or any of that stuff it's it's really touching and they they do it so well and so tastefully like I just can't believe people are so offended by it they want to take it out of the game stupid if this is what earned EA a big golden poo hold it up high
8014804	8015125	Right?
8016807	8017587	Let's move on.
8017628	8019350	I'm all huffy now after that story.
8020171	8021212	Oh, let's do the mailbag.
8022073	8024055	Let's follow that up with some listener emails.
8024816	8025116	You know what?
8025136	8026798	The people I like to hear from.
8026859	8028741	Let's do some listener emails tonight.
8033892	8036554	Every week, you guys send us emails.
8036814	8041717	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com and DarkSakura opens up the email bag and reads some of her favorites.
8041757	8045680	But since she's not here tonight, we took a poo in the bag.
8045700	8050002	That's kind of detrimental to ourselves, isn't it?
8050022	8051803	There are some good emails in here.
8051823	8052184	It's not poo.
8052204	8054365	There are some good emails tonight and Alan's going to read them tonight.
8055492	8056212	Oh my god!
8073721	8077764	He plays them enough to give a basic review and some history of the title.
8078184	8080986	Needless to say, it's a massive undertaking and worth checking out.
8081186	8086430	He has a YouTube channel, but much more content is posted on the Archive.org site.
8086990	8093114	He also started a Kron Sega series, which is going through all of the Master System titles in order.
8093835	8095796	The humor is pretty dry, but fun to watch.
8096456	8102620	Anyone wanting to know more retro gaming history or looking for some old games to play will want to give it a look.
8102881	8103321	Signed, Will.
8104301	8108524	Man, some people have a lot of time available.
8108584	8109504	I think it's great.
8109544	8110545	It's a great endeavor, though.
8111685	8118529	I saw, someone linked me to, it might have been DarkSakura, actually, a group of Let's Play people on YouTube.
8118549	8119329	There's four of them.
8119369	8123172	They did a simultaneous Battletoads, the original.
8123212	8124132	That game is hard as hell.
8124212	8130996	It's on YouTube, but it's quad screen competition to see who could reach the end of the game the fastest.
8131636	8134517	and it's filled with swears because that game is hard and that was very fun.
8135037	8136978	So look up Battletoads competition for that.
8137498	8146262	Second email is from Stan who writes, Hi OLR, I have a question for you and anyone listening or this could be a future foogle question.
8146822	8152004	What video game franchise would you like to see reimagined or translated into another genre?
8152664	8154685	For example, the Mario series was fantastic as an RPG.
8160256	8166561	My answer would be seeing the Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy characters be introduced in a Soul Calibur game.
8168202	8169563	So, like, Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy.
8169583	8170703	Well, there was Urgeis.
8171444	8174506	Do you want to kind of stretch it a little bit?
8174666	8179690	I also think it'd be funny to see Grand Theft Auto reimagined as a Japanese dating sim game.
8181791	8182892	Now that's just silly.
8183272	8184153	Signed, Stan.
8184433	8185393	Sent from his iPhone.
8185774	8186014	Okay.
8187955	8191237	And he's very upset about the Instagram news this week.
8191977	8193758	Gosh, that's a tough one.
8193878	8196319	What would I like to see cross genres?
8199160	8203823	And Persona 4 is getting a fighting game and I saw that email from Atlas and I was like, what?
8204103	8206224	How about an 8-bit version of Demon's Souls?
8208052	8208693	DarkSakura.com
8228481	8229782	I heard something about a soundtrack.
8229982	8231443	Six-player co-op.
8231903	8232803	Now that sounds fun.
8232923	8233123	Yeah.
8233284	8238606	Not exactly cross-genre, unless you want to say it's Portal being ported to 8-bit side-scroller.
8239987	8242028	Yeah, that question is really insanely difficult.
8244353	8257565	and my mind is just stuck in the fact that Super Mario RPG was freaking gorgeous and that was like the first RPG that ever really meant something to me and I actually I think it might be my very first RPG I ever actually beat.
8257605	8263170	Superstar Saga was not half bad, Partners in Time I didn't get far enough into but was still pretty fun.
8265192	8267314	I mean a Disney RPG, Kingdom Hearts was...
8268536	8274789	I don't know that there's one specific series that would mean something to me in a different genre though that I could really pick.
8276243	8277203	God of War in the style of Mario Party
8298989	8304055	Kratos is mad because he got max stars, but someone else got a star because they didn't get any stars.
8304956	8305978	How about... Okay, I got one.
8306078	8306398	I got one.
8306418	8306699	I got one.
8307219	8311224	Saints Row as a Pokemon game, but it's hoes.
8313507	8340204	gotta catch em all or it's diseases cause Saints Row is a fucking hilarious game and I would like to I'd like to see it as kind of like a silly RPG call me crazy any other comments from chat or was that it I'm looking Mario franchise is Call of Duty headshot against Princess Peach
8340549	8345391	How about Mass Effect as a more fantasy RPG?
8346372	8349533	Like with hit points and shit instead of the whole like first person.
8349553	8351214	Although I got to say, I do, I don't know.
8351834	8354135	Shepard arrives on the Citadel and pulls out a gun blade.
8355456	8357576	Not that crazy, but I don't know.
8358017	8363259	I got to admit, I'm not much of a first person shooter type person, but the combat in Mass Effect is pretty darn good.
8363319	8364459	I guess I really wouldn't change it.
8364880	8369782	I did hear though they were doing that legit first person shooter out of Mass Effect and that would have been kind of fun to play, I think.
8369962	8370082	Yeah.
8370782	8372744	Bust a Move, the music game as an RPG.
8373525	8374606	Kind of Dance Summit style.
8374886	8375527	Shane's suggestion.
8375547	8378570	Well, yeah, because you've got Kitty Ann and them.
8378650	8379071	It would be fun.
8379111	8381473	She could cast spells, disco spells.
8381793	8382834	Disco spells.
8383095	8384116	That would be the name of the game.
8384836	8385917	Disco spells.
8385997	8386318	Woo!
8386458	8386778	All right.
8389601	8390302	All right, there you go.
8390342	8391343	That's it for the emails tonight.
8392458	8408145	Send us emails, mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Again, that's mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com My answer to that question also is Ridge Racer, but as a puzzle bobble slash puzzle fighter game where you're dropping cars down.
8409505	8410286	They just wreck up.
8410306	8412526	Trying to fill blocks like poyo poyo.
8412807	8413387	You're weird.
8413927	8416368	Alright, let's do the FUs of the week.
8416428	8418149	It's the part of the show where we get angsty.
8433450	8434351	I'll start tonight.
8435331	8438734	F you to that people that are sending those letters to EA.
8439395	8441976	There's so many reasons to hate EA, but that's not one of them.
8442057	8444318	That's one of the reasons to appreciate what they're doing.
8445459	8446400	So F you to all of them.
8446420	8447381	F you to sheep.
8448081	8449802	F you to people that are sheep.
8450163	8453505	Because that's who those type of people are, are sheep.
8454186	8455667	So think for yourselves.
8457328	8457848	F you to sheep.
8458169	8458429	Alan F.
8459614	8463658	I guess F you to the fact that I had a job interview two weeks ago and I didn't get it.
8463918	8464819	You know, shit happens.
8464899	8466260	It's good to have an interview.
8467121	8476689	But also, while I was trekking home from that interview for the job I didn't get, I was completely done up in a suit, dress shoes, you know, interview attire.
8477891	8482034	Rolled my ankle on uneven pavement and completely ate shit on the sidewalk.
8483035	8484215	Hilarious, I'm sure.
8484655	8486676	Should be on YouTube if anyone had a camera phone out.
8486936	8492217	So yeah, F you to, I guess, not getting a job and being a klutz in the middle of public.
8493038	8496118	F you to not having a job and needing a new pair of pants now.
8496158	8500199	Yeah, and I had to throw the pants out because the road rash was so bad it ripped a hole in it.
8501840	8502580	Do you have anything, Jason?
8503140	8506721	F you to myself for forgetting how to get out of a door of a car.
8507472	8508713	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8523550	8528594	But, anti-FU to immune systems and the ability to recover from that.
8529394	8538260	And I think there was another thing, something about keys and doors and where I'm staying while I'm out here, but I think the injury made me forget it, so I guess I don't have it right now.
8538280	8539741	That's a great story, though.
8540602	8545545	If anyone asks, someone tried to mug you and you beat the shit out of them, and that's the little mark.
8545786	8547247	Or tell them it's a sex injury.
8547267	8547767	Yeah.
8548027	8549128	and let him try to figure it out.
8549188	8558776	I think I was coming up with some kind of, I tried to participate, I was casted for the role of something in Face Off and that was the suspicion mark they tested to see how good my face looked like somebody else's.
8558936	8559396	Bar fight.
8559456	8559837	Bar fight.
8560017	8560397	Bar fight.
8560457	8560757	Go with that.
8560777	8563579	Because that coat, like a beer bottle, could have hit you right there.
8563720	8564300	Oh yeah, easily.
8564600	8564981	Bar fight.
8565021	8565521	Right position.
8566842	8568023	Alright, there it is, your FU's of the week.
8568183	8571505	Alright, a few more news stories for you guys and then we're going to open up the Skype line.
8571665	8574547	Actually, we're going to hear from some people from PAX East first.
8574567	8580791	I'm going to bump their call in first tonight so we can talk to them about PAX East because we all ignorant because we weren't there.
8581191	8587635	So we need the OL Army to help us out, especially the New Yorkers and surrounding areas who did go.
8587995	8589156	So we'll talk to them in a little bit.
8589236	8590657	But for now, a few more stories for you guys.
8590677	8590937	Jason.
8592437	8595718	MissSplosionMan is finally making it to iOS.
8595778	8600479	More specifically, ExplosionMan of any form is finally making it to iOS, which will arrive this summer.
8600860	8614183	You may remember a couple months ago, Capcom decided to make a very similar game by the name of Maxplosion that came out on iOS, and there was a little kerfuffle between the two studios, Capcom and TwistedPixel.
8614504	8618725	TwistedPixel says, well, you know, Capcom made Mega Man, so I guess it's not all that bad, and...
8619665	8620926	Drama ceased very quickly.
8621927	8627650	Missplosion Man was obviously the hit sequel to the original Splosion Man, both Xbox Live Arcade titles.
8628031	8637957	Missplosion Man is heading to the App Store with a version for Steam on the PC, games for Windows Live, another PC gaming service, and Windows Phone 7 as well.
8638498	8642160	No specific pricing or specific release date, just sometime this summer.
8642540	8647124	If you were at PAX East, maybe you played it, and if the game differs in any way, call in.
8647324	8647664	Let us know.
8649497	8652438	I am legit excited about this game that I'm about to talk about.
8652638	8658881	And it's kind of sad when you get more excited about the portable version of a game than the console version of a game.
8658961	8661201	But I have legit reason for this, guys.
8662062	8667904	Epic Mickey, of course, is getting Epic Mickey 2 on the consoles, which, you know, is all fine and dandy, whatever.
8667964	8668644	Still Wii, right?
8669664	8672185	Wii, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3.
8672846	8673966	So good for them, stepping it up.
8674586	8675347	But on the 3DS...
8677213	8680356	Disney Epic Mickey, Power of Illusion.
8681157	8683199	Oh yes, it's what it sounds like.
8684020	8691327	It's a basic, I don't want to say a sequel to, but heavily inspired by Castle of Illusion.
8692625	8693385	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8712617	8713478	Blah, blah, blah.
8713798	8719084	But it gets its influence from a lot of modern day Disney movies like Tangled is going to have a level.
8719364	8722208	And yeah, I'm so excited about this.
8722748	8725211	Beauty and the Beast from the screenshots here you can see.
8725611	8729716	I mean, it's just got that right mix of like retro look to it.
8730156	8731117	No Tron, no sale.
8732378	8732978	You never know.
8733078	8733679	You never know.
8733819	8734419	Peter Pan.
8734939	8736600	Tron is in that Kingdom Hearts game coming out.
8737200	8738060	Dream Drop Distance.
8739660	8741021	It just looks gorgeous.
8742241	8743001	I'm so excited.
8743342	8745482	I could care less now about the console one.
8745502	8746703	Just bring me that 3DS game.
8747043	8748963	You guys, it's a 3DS game I'm excited about.
8749944	8750424	Woohoo!
8751744	8752664	It's not just a port.
8753105	8755325	A 3D port of a good classic game like Zelda.
8755805	8757646	Rama in the chat room put it best.
8757706	8759106	I can't say it any better myself.
8759687	8760707	Shut up and take my money.
8765600	8768403	So this story is a doozy.
8768483	8770226	Wow, I'm not sure how to report this.
8770986	8773029	I wanted you to do this for a reason.
8773249	8780098	I guess the state of Arizona just looked at Florida as the worst state in the country and was like, no, we have to do better.
8781994	8784037	And for the last seven or eight years, they have been.
8784157	8791227	Okay, so this story is about a bill that has passed both sides of the state legislature.
8791327	8793690	So it's ready to be signed by the governor.
8794892	8798597	And it's the anti-trolling cyberbullying bill.
8798937	8802280	Is it just me or does the governor of Arizona kind of remind you of Cruella de Vil?
8803001	8809287	She's the one who put her finger in the face of Obama, right?
8809568	8811850	Doesn't she remind you of Cruella de Vil a little bit?
8812210	8813832	I'm not trying to get political or whatever.
8815233	8817536	She's kind of nasty.
8817856	8819077	Anyway, sorry.
8819518	8820819	Didn't mean to derail you.
8821075	8822477	Yeah, so it passed both houses.
8822557	8825220	It's waiting for the governor to sign it, Governor Brewer.
8825840	8832848	And basically, let me read exactly what the statute dictates.
8833569	8841617	It is unlawful for any person with intent to terrify, intimidate, threaten, harass, annoy...
8842578	8857961	or offend to use any electronic or digital device and use any obscene, lewd or profane language or suggest any lewd or lascivious act or threaten to inflict personal harm to the person or property of any person.
8858722	8875745	So you cannot be shitty to people on the internet if the recipient is in Arizona because if they try to prosecute you, it could be a class one, I think, misdemeanor, which I want to say the maximum fine for that is $2,500 and up to six months in jail.
8876145	8878646	Is that the right direction that the receiver has to be in Arizona?
8878686	8881706	I kind of figured it would have been the sender, the origin.
8881986	8884227	Oh, that is actually addressed here.
8884347	8885067	Let me find it.
8885567	8885887	Sorry.
8885907	8885987	Okay.
8886656	8891722	Yeah, come arrest me Arizona sucks, what are you gonna do about it?
8892743	8900786	There are already exceptions to the First Amendment, which is freedom of speech, which is obscene and obscenity is very vague.
8901666	8907469	And also inciting violence, like saying, this person should get beat up, let's all meet at a place and time.
8907489	8908369	That's inciting violence.
8908549	8913911	But just being an asshole on the internet, you know, think of the Penny Arcade, greater internet theory.
8914391	8918813	Have you ever read the comments to a story on Yahoo News?
8921478	8924834	Oh my god, they would fill the jails in Arizona overnight.
8927123	8928004	I'm fucking serious.
8928044	8931006	Go read the comments to any story on Yahoo News.
8931286	8931766	Any of them.
8931906	8934048	Or the answers on Yahoo Answers for that matter.
8934128	8942714	It could be a story about fluffy kitties and dogs and it'll be like, that dog is fucking ugly and it looks like an Obama dog because Obama's ugly.
8942774	8948137	Oh my god, I gotta go to Yahoo News right now and give you an idea of what I mean here.
8949378	8951099	A whole new level of quality for the show, huh?
8952260	8953101	This is important.
8954366	8961470	because yes, and this is how it ties into the gaming world because of course, what do gamers love to do more than anything?
8962151	8962551	Troll.
8964193	8991996	be shitty to each other with no consequences which I guess this bill is trying to fix and if this bill does get signed it's like many bills that California itself has had where it's effective as law for like a minute and then it immediately gets shoved into the courts and it's unenforceable and it gets juggled around in the courts to decide if it's constitutional or not for years and eventually goes away so already you know people are saying that this is way too vague and there's no way this is enforceable and blah blah blah
8992296	9000383	Call me a grammar Nazi unless that's illegal in this state, but the text of this bill is one of those things.
9000763	9015235	For some reason, there have been these weird quirk grammar stories in the news lately, notably talking about the new iPad because they only referred to it during the keynote as the new iPad.
9015536	9019339	So if anybody says, I want the iPad 3, no, you want the new iPad.
9020400	9034191	But you read the text of the particular statute and what jumped out to me immediately was it is unlawful for any person with intent to use any electronic or digital device.
9035071	9039215	It is unlawful for any person to use any electric or digital device.
9040195	9040516	Ah, yes.
9041748	9042389	One little letter.
9042409	9050738	I don't mean to narrow in on this, but it's just kind of like, the language already sucks, but to throw something in there that just doesn't make any damn sense.
9051680	9052340	Come on, guys.
9054068	9058889	So if I write something rude on the side of a toaster, I'm trolling.
9060590	9063010	I just fucking arrest you in Arizona because you're trolling.
9063391	9065411	You are now a wanted criminal in Arizona.
9066131	9075134	Since the bill stipulates that the offense only has to occur on Arizona soil, that basically puts the entire internet on notice, according to this article.
9075614	9078695	So if the infraction...
9080015	9087897	allegedly is viewable within Arizona, which, of course, Facebook, last I checked, doesn't filter themselves out of Arizona.
9087957	9088818	Maybe they should now.
9089638	9091938	That'll make people in Arizona really happy.
9091959	9094479	Did Google already block YouTube in Arizona yet?
9094979	9095179	Yeah.
9096460	9097720	That'll probably be in next week's stories.
9098000	9107363	So if the infraction is you can view it from an Arizona network, then you, I guess, according to this bill, have the right to try and prosecute.
9107665	9115868	The narrow-mindedness of something that in their dream little world could affect the whole freaking world.
9117365	9136948	Another addition to this is that if the trolling is contributing, if you're able to prove that it's attributing to actual stalking of a person, then that would bring it up to a Class 3 felony and there's a whole additional cache of stalking laws that would then be brought into this.
9138229	9151523	I guess it's supposed to be a countermeasure to cyberbullying, which I do believe kids have killed themselves because of hate pages made like this page that someone is, you know, a fat slut on Facebook.
9152043	9154606	That's shitty and parents and teachers should get involved.
9155006	9160392	So cyberbullying sucks, but an anti-trolling bill is not the way to go about it, at least not the way it's written.
9162508	9168710	Some sections of Yahoo News have apparently switched to requiring Facebook logins, which I guess a lot.
9168730	9170170	But here, let me give you an example.
9170571	9177053	Here's a story on President Obama wishes Jews, Christians, Happy Passover, Easter.
9177533	9182174	So what's the harm in the president wishing people a happy holiday for whatever it is they believe in, right?
9182634	9183775	Nothing wrong with that, right?
9185529	9186029	Let's see.
9187711	9190714	Jack Haynes says, Obama, stop lying.
9190774	9192115	We know you're a secret Muslim.
9192675	9201923	Bob Harvey says, I'd vote for Reagan's corpse before I vote for this egotistical, clueless, inept narcissist.
9203164	9206087	There actually is a story about a dead politician beating an alive one.
9206287	9210591	Jack Van Valen says, did he get the okay from the Muslim Brotherhood?
9212805	9225318	Like, if you are Republican, Democrat, whatever, I don't care, Romney, Obama, just don't fucking vote for Rick Santorum.
9225678	9227280	Seriously, oh my god.
9227740	9229942	Like that, I draw the fucking line at that asshole.
9230323	9232365	But, I mean, he is the president.
9233205	9234627	Scroll up, what's the headline again?
9236132	9241315	Obama wishes... President Obama wishes Jews, Christians, Happy Passover, Easter.
9241916	9247419	The White House Christmas card from this most recent December was, I think, their cat or their dog.
9247499	9249040	I don't remember what fucking pet they have.
9249641	9251322	It just said, Happy Holidays.
9252062	9252482	That's it.
9252583	9254064	No Merry Christmas or Hanukkah or anything.
9254104	9256625	Happy Holidays with no Christmas tree and no nativity.
9257025	9259047	And the Christians flipped their shit.
9259407	9265131	Now he's wishing Christians and Jews a Passover... Some Christians flipped their shit.
9265291	9265491	Yes.
9266091	9267713	So it's, yeah.
9269796	9270577	Can't win for losing.
9272299	9272800	Anyhow.
9272980	9277345	It's okay if you're a Muslim, a Christian, or a Jew.
9278266	9279648	Can't we all just get along?
9279668	9282191	Holidays of advertising past.
9282331	9284194	Only if you're in Arizona.
9286872	9290995	All right, look, less politics, more gaming stories.
9291375	9292016	Jason, help.
9292216	9303224	Well, I guess it's not exactly politics, but cute iOS app, Childhood's End, back online after Pedobear mix-up.
9303964	9307327	Apple was worried it might be a recruiting tool for pedophiles.
9307947	9308548	Thank you for watching!
9323324	9335135	and the developer submitted an update and the one particular app store reviewer got a hold of it and said, why is Pedobear advancing on a childhood game?
9336015	9350408	And they sent the developer a notice that they will need additional time for an extended review and immediately followed that up with direct contact with the developer and expressing their concern and caution over the subject matter.
9351008	9354772	I'd never heard of this app before, and I looked at a lot of stuff about it.
9356914	9361678	Perhaps one of the things that doesn't exactly help... Why were you so interested in a Pedobear app?
9361978	9362659	I'm just kidding.
9363660	9364961	Researching the story...
9366022	9367443	The description of the app says,
9389473	9394676	Not exactly the childish that you would expect, but what's in a name?
9395477	9399219	There's a couple things coming out about this article.
9399299	9408965	I haven't exactly understood what exactly this is, but there's a screenshot of the in-game bears versus a picture of Pedobear and saying...
9409725	9412147	Of course, the image is broken now, so I can't recite it off.
9412187	9415810	But it's drawing a contrast that this is a teddy bear.
9415870	9419493	You will see it in almost any American child's home that has stuffed animals.
9420134	9421255	Why is this a big deal?
9421955	9425038	I mean, we know why it's a big deal, but this particular version just makes no sense.
9427079	9429721	The game was subtly changed.
9429741	9431703	The art for the bear was changed a little bit.
9431743	9436287	The update resubmitted, and I believe it's been approved at this point.
9438644	9456733	now pita bear free one of those things silly situation for something that probably didn't need to happen but it did so there you go one more news story for you guys before we get to the calls and as if this show couldn't go any further down the toilet
9459210	9467597	I think this news story is kind of like it's trolling that somehow is traveling across the game blogosphere because this guy can't be fucking serious.
9467617	9468778	Tell Governor Brewer.
9470099	9471480	Well, arrest this man.
9471640	9472781	It is... Who did this?
9472881	9474102	It was Camille...
9475143	9476284	and Gurmanprez.
9476804	9482788	I'm sorry if I butchered that name, but Camille Gurmanprez talked about Studio Arcados.
9483288	9485130	They made the game Hell Yeah for Sega.
9485530	9486911	It's one of their first games to come out.
9487851	9490493	They're taking a month off and then they're going to come back and do some more games.
9490553	9501240	But saying it's Sega's PAX East booth, the comment was, quote, we're going to make two games, one game on pee and one game on poo.
9502361	9502942	Yes, that's right.
9503122	9507786	One game on P, one game about P, and one game about poo.
9508647	9510668	It's going to be a Steam game, I think.
9513010	9514572	Okay.
9514952	9516713	I swear to God, it's on every game blog.
9516774	9517714	Go look at any of them.
9518575	9524480	Presented with no comment?
9524520	9525321	Is that what I just heard?
9526710	9528532	Do I need to comment on this story?
9528913	9529894	What is there possibly?
9530254	9531836	I mean, can we set the bar?
9532117	9546094	We already had news stories about the urinal games where they were installing games on the urinals for men to play or, you know, women if they want an extra challenge while they relieve themselves.
9549819	9553681	Women get the Metal Gear Solid version where no one catches them in the bathroom.
9556602	9558302	Because that might be kind of awkward.
9562444	9566685	For my birthday, will you get me the pee and poo plush dolls that are in chat?
9567006	9568746	If that's what you really want.
9571127	9572088	Is this for real?
9572428	9574829	Yeah, they were on sale in the castor actually a couple years ago.
9575169	9575869	You would know that.
9578672	9582616	I have an idea what a poo plush doll looks like, but I want to... Oh, God.
9583737	9584858	They're so cute.
9590383	9593526	Maybe they got licensed to this game or something.
9593706	9594467	I don't know.
9595048	9596029	You need a license?
9596189	9596909	Okay, never mind.
9596969	9598951	Maybe pee and poo have been licensed.
9598971	9600373	They're the actual characters.
9600833	9603596	Ranma, can you post Salacious Pops link to the Tumblr?
9605749	9610651	So the podcast listeners have an idea what we're talking about because I can't.
9611671	9612771	How much do they want for this?
9612951	9613412	Oh, sorry.
9613432	9616253	Oh, this item is discontinued.
9616413	9618053	No pee and poo for you.
9619374	9621374	I'll make you a poo for your birthday.
9621414	9624735	If you go on eBay, you'll find that pee and poo plushies are a collector's item.
9625315	9626676	How much do they go for?
9626696	9629777	Ah.
9631733	9633914	And on that note, we're going to go to the Skype line.
9633954	9644178	We're going to open it up right now and take your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9644639	9651422	Actually, I do want to make sure our PAX East people get through, so I'm going to kind of wait and let them call in first here because I want to hear from people who went to PAX East.
9652122	9653542	Again, it's 1-877-GAME-OLR.
9653602	9655983	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9656564	9657124	And here they come.
9658885	9659845	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9659865	9660286	Who's this?
9660886	9661426	It's Ranma.
9661446	9662126	What's up, everyone?
9662166	9663127	What a surprise.
9663227	9663687	Hi, Ranma.
9663707	9664107	How are you?
9664647	9665387	I'm doing good.
9665427	9666348	How about you?
9666708	9673470	I don't know what to think after I've seen the pee and poo plush dolls, but... Yeah, my thoughts exactly.
9674891	9678032	So, you literally just got back in the door from PAX East, right?
9678392	9680753	Yeah, about an hour ago, give or take.
9680773	9682994	And you've been listening to OLR the whole time, I'm sure.
9683777	9684758	Yes, yes, yes.
9684818	9687179	Behold the power of smartphones.
9688060	9689561	So how was PAX East?
9691522	9691782	Fun.
9691842	9692883	I really enjoyed it.
9693963	9694304	All right.
9694324	9695645	There's your PAX East wrap-up.
9695665	9698166	Have a good one.
9698186	9698787	You're funny.
9699227	9700588	You're a funny guy.
9700668	9701888	Have you been to PAX East before?
9702429	9703930	Yeah, this is my third PAX East.
9704590	9705611	This is your third PAX East.
9705651	9706491	Where does this rank?
9707452	9710414	Because I was reading some negativities on Twitter.
9711974	9717537	The negativities are probably coming from the people that were complaining about the fact that it was the same weekend as Anime Boston.
9717857	9724861	Hey, look, people, if you've gone to more than five to six anime conventions in a year, it wouldn't kill you to go to a gaming convention, which was a hell of a lot better.
9725101	9727983	Just please shower while you're at the convention.
9728003	9728603	That's all we ask.
9729304	9731885	Actually, at this one, there was a lot of showering.
9731905	9733486	There was very little confunk.
9737143	9741066	Sorry, I'm laughing because Actdeft in the chat room.
9742026	9745729	The Pee and Poo dolls might be out of stock, but now there's an HIV plushie.
9746609	9749911	Oh, jeez.
9750452	9754054	It's in a family with a hepatitis C and a tuberculosis and polio.
9756416	9757316	I love the internet.
9757376	9758157	I love it so much.
9758277	9760078	Oh, yeah, PAX East.
9762259	9763440	So what was on the show floor?
9763480	9764100	What were they showing?
9764121	9766242	We didn't hear a lot of news news come out of PAX East.
9767606	9768226	No, no.
9768306	9773747	It was just more... From what I can see, there was a lot of independent developers, especially from the Boston area.
9774147	9780549	I mean, there was a big Microsoft display, them really pushing the Kinect games.
9781449	9782889	Over in the corner was Nintendo.
9782909	9788130	They were in the same place they were last year, pimping out the 3DS with one new game, Spirit Camera.
9789591	9791771	It was a nice mention of MMOs.
9791791	9795692	You had League of Legends all the way towards the back of the Expo Hall, but
9796272	9798018	Packed all the damn time.
9799162	9802815	There were people wandering around checking out Lotro and D&D Online.
9805171	9823107	And one other thing that PAX does a lot of too is that they just have... It's not just about the new games or whatever that's on the show floor, but there's people sitting in the hallways playing card games and people playing D&D in rooms and people playing Magic the Gathering and classic games.
9823708	9827771	I mean, how many freaking games did you see people playing?
9828652	9829273	Too many.
9829333	9830113	I mean, there was like...
9831411	9832192	and Catan.
9832832	9834053	I mean, there was one booth.
9834073	9839939	I forget the name of it, but you could pick up a game and borrow it and just learn to play it.
9840639	9845564	I remember early yesterday afternoon, I was coming back from the expo hall.
9845924	9847585	I ran into a Daisy cosplayer.
9847625	9848626	We started talking.
9848666	9853330	Next thing you know, I'm sitting there with her husband, a couple, and two other people.
9853530	9855953	We're sitting there playing a round of Cards Against Humanity.
9856853	9857394	Good times.
9857947	9858668	Oh, yes.
9859148	9859769	Yes, indeed.
9861030	9862050	Did you go to any of the panels?
9862190	9865893	Because I know there's a lot of great panels and things that come out of PAX.
9866033	9867315	A lot of announcements come out of the panels.
9867895	9869716	I went to one panel the whole weekend.
9869776	9873619	It was the Nerdcore Hip-Hop panel, which is something I look forward to every year.
9873860	9874200	Nice.
9874280	9874740	How was that?
9875501	9876181	It was great.
9876242	9882607	It was a little bit different from last year's, where it was Frontalot, MegaRan, and Kay Murdoch.
9882627	9883848	They pretty much discussed...
9884528	9888830	The history of hip-hop, nerdcore, how it came together.
9889190	9894592	Last year, Megaran discussed more about how he got into it, his backstory.
9894892	9896832	This year, it was a little bit more about Frontalot.
9896872	9897633	It was pretty cool.
9898833	9899813	Who did the concert this year?
9899833	9900534	Was there any concerts?
9900974	9901894	Yeah, there was a lot of concerts.
9901954	9907876	Friday night was Metroid Metal and the Proto Men.
9908416	9909837	I forgot who was on the...
9910197	9911558	I think it was Storm Runner.
9911618	9912638	I think that was the first one.
9912998	9919502	I caught a part of Metroid Metal and this was my first time listening to them and I was like, wow.
9919742	9921843	The best way I can describe Metroid Metal is this.
9922463	9926745	Take Metallica in their prime at plus one.
9928486	9929486	I love Metroid Metal.
9929526	9930867	We've played some of their stuff on the show.
9930907	9931547	It's good stuff.
9932408	9934789	I picked up both their albums and we listened to it on the way back.
9936057	9936597	Very nice.
9937278	9943319	And Saturday night was Colton, Paul and Storm, Front of Lot, and MegaRam.
9943799	9944139	Okay, wait.
9944159	9944679	Look what I found.
9944699	9945259	Look what I found.
9945760	9946340	Metroid Metal.
9948380	9953501	Oh, yeah.
9954482	9956042	I can't wait for Metroid Screamo.
9958371	9961074	Oh, Rob, here's a quick story that you'll greatly appreciate.
9962175	9973145	As me and Jovi were walking into the convention center, I had said to her that I saw somebody with an X-Play pen on their back.
9973245	9974927	I'm like, I threw mine in the garbage.
9974947	9975508	She's like, why?
9975528	9976188	I'm like, because...
9977009	9978250	I don't support G4.
9978610	9981793	The person at least six feet in front of me overheard me.
9981813	9983974	He's like, yeah, I can't stand them either.
9984394	9989918	Next thing you know, there's about 20 to 30 people going into the convention complaining about how much G4 sucks.
9991600	9992480	Well done, Boston.
9992580	9993001	Well done.
9993961	9994181	Yes.
9994582	9995102	Yes, indeed.
9996203	9996523	All right.
9996643	9999285	So before I let you go, what else do we need to know about PAX East?
9999325	10000346	Anything else you got to share with us?
10001278	10013224	I did check out a couple of games Final Fantasy Theater Rhythm It's a fun game Only Square Enix can take a music rhythm game and make it into an RPG 40 bucks worth?
10014224	10014744	Is it worth it?
10015465	10028571	Yeah, that's definitely a day one purchase Interesting, okay I also checked out Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Episode 2 And is it as shitty as the first one?
10030245	10034747	I love the graphics, the controlling, not so much.
10036128	10038590	I'd wait on that.
10039070	10042812	But this was something funny because we were talking to one of the people at the booth.
10042932	10046094	Sorry, I just had a cry for Sonic.
10046934	10047775	That's okay.
10048215	10052197	We were talking to one of the guys at the booth and he was saying it's only going to be on 360 and PS3 because...
10055165	10056988	This is a Wii's hardware limitations.
10057008	10057909	They won't be able to port it.
10058290	10063939	And I said to my sister, but yet, I have Sonic 4 Episode 1 on my Android phone.
10064179	10066022	And the guy's like, yeah, what does that tell you?
10067564	10068105	Very nice.
10070809	10073451	Well, Ranma, I'm glad to hear you had a good time at PAX East.
10073491	10080417	I wish I could have joined you guys out there, but now it looks like I'll have to do Seattle this year and maybe Boston next year if money looks better.
10080517	10081878	I was going to say 2013, bro.
10081898	10082739	2013, OLR suite.
10083740	10084901	Fonamay for your birthday?
10085021	10085521	Hello?
10086762	10087943	That's going to have to happen.
10088123	10090185	The way I see it, everybody's telling me to go to Fonamay.
10090205	10091666	I might have to go west, young man.
10092006	10095649	Oh, good, because all I was about to hear was excuses, and I'm not having any of that.
10095709	10096430	So we hope to see you.
10097522	10098703	I don't need an angry Rob.
10098743	10099583	I don't need that.
10100644	10100904	All right.
10101464	10102304	I better let you go, Ranma.
10102865	10104805	One more thing before I go.
10106066	10108707	Assassin's Creed, go to their Facebook fan page.
10108727	10110848	They're having a contest for the best cosplay.
10111168	10112909	Please vote for my sister, Lady Ava.
10113209	10117511	She made the Heliquin costume from scratch, and it's fucking phenomenal.
10117571	10118512	Please vote for her.
10118552	10118772	That's it.
10119372	10148088	you got it, take care buddy bye bye I gotta make a quick call here sorry I see other calls coming in but I've gotta make a quick call here cause somebody very special wants to be on the show and I need to oblige here if I can find them cause they said they were on Skype but I don't see them this is amazing radio we're gonna call them right now try to get them on the phone
10152995	10153836	I'm going to hope it works.
10156360	10157942	This is live radio, boys and girls.
10159585	10160666	Making a call right now.
10162389	10163050	Trying anyway.
10164352	10164772	Hi.
10165213	10166415	Hi, DarkSakura.
10166435	10167657	Hi.
10167857	10168338	How are you?
10169574	10171717	I'm the voiceless lender.
10171837	10173059	See, you do sound like hell.
10173119	10177706	I told the listeners at the top of the show that you sound like hell, but I'm sorry to hear that.
10178487	10178968	It's all right.
10179008	10179689	I'm feeling better.
10179909	10180410	That's good.
10180470	10184376	Listening to OLR with Jason and Alan is making you feel better?
10185419	10190282	Well, that and exceeding amounts of Robitussin and Sudafed.
10191602	10192703	She is high as hell right now.
10194204	10195044	Dude, no way.
10195244	10204009	I can take all this stuff with... No, if you want to see me high as hell, you should have seen me when I had pneumonia a few years ago and was on Vicodin and codeine all the time.
10205710	10209232	DarkSakura, is there anything you wanted to say on tonight's news or anything we talked about?
10209752	10210213	Oh, yeah.
10210313	10210833	One comment.
10214867	10220271	And this, that clearly is a comment on pee and poo games.
10220871	10223873	Well, Shermie farted too with all the Capcom stuff.
10224392	10227174	Oh, that's good to have the comment from Sharmi.
10227214	10227875	Appreciate that.
10228015	10230397	Especially since we're not doing the show at your house anymore.
10230497	10232959	But you have a birthday coming up.
10233600	10234100	Yes, I do.
10234140	10239164	So when we come back in two weeks, because we're not going to be here next week, when we come back in two weeks, it'll be like your birthday show weekend.
10239224	10240986	So what are we going to do for your birthday?
10242747	10243748	Cake and pink berry.
10244709	10245529	That sounds doable.
10245690	10246450	I think we could do that.
10247151	10248312	Yeah, because...
10249147	10259073	Well, I mean, I'm doing something this Friday, but you know me, when I have my birthday, I like to let the party go, you know, for a couple weeks.
10259273	10259874	Exactly.
10259974	10260714	Make it last.
10260874	10262936	You only get one a year, so make it last for a month.
10263436	10264036	Exactly.
10264517	10268499	And you remember the beer and cake potluck?
10268959	10269259	I do.
10270540	10273202	Well, I'm thinking about having a pie party.
10273702	10274563	I'm thinking about it.
10274843	10275803	Pie is awesome.
10276164	10277965	So I think you should definitely look into doing that.
10278516	10278776	Yes.
10279316	10283518	Or either that or just Dave and Busters and I drink until I barf or something.
10283558	10283918	I don't know.
10284118	10286279	I hope you feel better in time for that to come around.
10286319	10288179	I hope this doesn't stick around for a week.
10288539	10289760	No, it's all allergies.
10291460	10298563	On Thursday, I was over at Becky's house playing with her son in the backyard that was very grassy.
10299063	10300203	I'm very allergic to grass.
10301284	10301424	And
10302176	10306817	I started stuffing up like right after that and Friday I was just sniffy.
10306917	10310398	Got the sniffy over and then started hacking so that's why I have no voice.
10311199	10311319	Aww.
10311819	10313039	Well, I hope you feel better.
10314780	10315000	Huh?
10315200	10316000	I hope you feel better.
10316560	10317140	Thank you.
10317300	10317760	I am.
10318141	10318501	Alright.
10318581	10320721	And I hope you're not too mad I changed the classic game of the week.
10321682	10322602	No, bitch.
10322942	10323182	Alright.
10324891	10330533	I kind of expected it, because honestly, I would have been disappointed if I didn't get to do the one I wanted.
10330713	10331254	Exactly.
10331334	10333875	So we'll hear that in two weeks when we come back with OLR.
10334395	10337996	Anything else you want to let the listeners know before we let you go pass out from Robitussin?
10338656	10342158	I'm not going to pass out from Robitussin, not for another hour anyway.
10342278	10343518	All right, then, before I hang up on you.
10345499	10345599	Um...
10347228	10347428	No.
10347788	10348068	Bye.
10348509	10349029	Bye.
10350009	10350389	Bye.
10351450	10352750	Bye, DarkSakura.
10352790	10353410	Thanks for calling.
10354151	10356151	It's always good to hear, you know, check in.
10357472	10357912	Say hello.
10357932	10358993	The phone's ringing off the hook tonight.
10359013	10359913	Hi, you're on Orange Tons Radio.
10359933	10360253	Who's this?
10360993	10361674	This is Shane.
10361854	10362374	Hi, Shane.
10362414	10362734	What's up?
10363374	10364415	I'm playing World of Warcraft.
10364435	10365135	That's what's up.
10365595	10367136	Did you go to PAX East this weekend?
10367616	10369076	I totally didn't.
10369597	10370617	So why are you calling?
10371557	10371937	I don't know.
10371978	10372858	Why are you calling?
10373818	10374438	You called us.
10374478	10375219	What do you want?
10375259	10375679	What's on your mind?
10376689	10399149	I wanted to respond to the EA getting the worst company of the year thing or whatever I totally, after reading EA's statement that they put out I felt really bad for them and I kind of feel like the internet won and lost because they were just way too loud and they should not have beaten Bank of America of all people
10399409	10404332	You do realize in their statement, like they said, well, at least it wasn't Halliburton or da-da-da.
10404672	10409154	And they named like three of the prior winners of the contest.
10409174	10411075	Oh, I didn't know there were prior winners.
10411195	10415477	But still, I don't think they should have even come close to winning.
10415537	10422441	I think there were a lot of other companies up there that I saw in the like half a picture I would see on Kotaku when I'd sadly go to their site.
10423780	10427202	I think I saw Best Buy up there, which they deserve to be up there.
10427422	10431323	I think I saw AT&T, which deserve to be up there.
10431443	10432624	Here's the thing, though.
10433064	10434365	Does it really matter?
10434645	10435865	It's just the internet.
10436346	10437726	It's a poll on the internet.
10437886	10446230	No, honestly, I guess it's publicity and the whole saying about publicity and stuff and it's never bad, blah, blah, blah.
10446738	10447279	Mass Effect 3 Ending
10456076	10457176	Um, I'm torn.
10458057	10459377	I appreciate what they're doing.
10459417	10461037	It's still not what I would like.
10461637	10465999	But one of the writers clarified some things this week on Twitter.
10466879	10475861	And it sounds like a lot of the doom and gloom that people inferred from the endings were because the writers thought we were smarter than that.
10476541	10483683	But, you know, that's a stupid thing to think when you're basing it off of things you've seen in the game for the past however many years the series has been going.
10484723	10501418	um so I'm excited to see the extended cut I know it's not going to satisfy me though because it's not what I exactly want which you know that's an impossible request anyway I kind of I mean can they do anything to make you happy though
10504408	10511393	Yes, what they could do is make a Mass Effect 4 with all my same characters and just make a new story and keep it going.
10511513	10516196	Because I am not done with Shepard or any of my crew members.
10517077	10519138	Even the ones that may or may not have died in 3.
10519218	10523641	And ones that you're trying to sleep with and continuing your relationship with.
10524182	10526303	Yes, especially Caden.
10526363	10528265	And you want a more explicit Mass Effect 4.
10528305	10528385	Yes.
10529711	10547169	No, no, but better romance scenes would be nice because it's like, you know, maybe a 10-year-old came up with them when they didn't have any concept of what a relationship is besides like kissing and holding hands and maybe like hitting the other person every so often.
10547952	10548753	Well, wait a minute, though.
10548853	10554317	Okay, let's get into the other story, which is about the whole target of the EA is a target of the anti-gay campaign.
10554377	10558000	So you've obviously romanced Kaiden with your man, Shep.
10558060	10563184	So you're benefiting from the content that they've put in the game.
10563964	10568167	A, do you think this campaign means anything?
10569008	10572811	No, it's just something for that stupid organization to do this week.
10574127	10575628	Because they pick something new every week.
10575988	10585274	And B, well, you kind of like showed me these scenes that, you know, the man-on-man with Kaiden and all that and how well done they were.
10586095	10587716	Well, they're well done.
10588096	10589617	Well, okay, wait, wait, let me back up.
10590197	10594699	The romance scene is not well done once you get into the romance part.
10595119	10599581	But the date scene and the conversations they have, brilliant.
10599641	10603362	Because Bioware, for the most part, can write amazingly well.
10604282	10608044	But they need to learn a thing or two about romance scenes.
10608064	10610104	Because Dragon Age, that was laughable.
10610605	10611565	I didn't see Mass Effect 1.
10612205	10615086	I didn't do anything in 2 because I was saving myself for Kaden.
10615586	10616607	And in 3, it's like...
10617327	10624388	Let me get pushed down on the bed and then we're gonna roll around for like half a second and oh, we're under covers now and we're sleeping.
10624448	10627689	Okay, but it's not like they're gonna get porno on you.
10627769	10633410	No, but it was also more like I can't spoil things.
10634110	10644692	It was like a shirtless scene of something that you do earlier in the game with another crew member that isn't romantic at all.
10646453	10646933	Wrestling?
10648151	10651934	Well, there's like a little sparring match.
10652194	10654996	That's kind of what it reminded me of, except we had no pants.
10656257	10659559	There were pants in the sparring match.
10659819	10660180	All right.
10660720	10667365	But otherwise, I mean, it's certainly more interesting than what we've probably seen in any other video game, wouldn't you say?
10668147	10683488	Probably more interesting, you know, the male-male or female-female stuff we've seen in other games, which has been remarkably little, but I'm sure in other games there have been better male-female romance scenes, because I assume...
10684569	10688272	The developers are probably straight and have more experience with that.
10688292	10691414	They couldn't just load up a porn website and find gay stuff.
10691574	10693756	That is a pretty blanket statement to make, though.
10693856	10696278	I mean, there's probably hundreds of people that work at BioWare.
10696318	10700541	I'm sure there's a couple people there that have some first-hand experience.
10700621	10705584	But I'm saying the ones that designed the scene, not that worked there, period.
10705844	10706185	Gotcha.
10706205	10707365	I'm sure there are like three.
10707906	10708146	Right.
10708783	10710844	Shane, I've got to let you go to get some more calls.
10710864	10712065	Do you have anything else you want to say?
10714366	10721990	Oh, you should go download the rest of your download content for Mass Effect 2 because the Shadow Broker is what I did today, that $10 one, and it was amazing.
10722170	10723271	It was so, so good.
10723431	10727473	I'll do that right now, except I spent all my points on that Pinball Arcade game.
10727814	10729114	Well, go buy more points.
10729595	10730575	Problem solved.
10730675	10731335	Holy crap.
10731856	10732596	I've got to let you go.
10732656	10733056	Bye now.
10733537	10733937	Bye-bye.
10738179	10740221	Excuse me, our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10742062	10748866	Acidic Vampire in our chatroom says, the actual romance scene is kind of dorky in Mass Effect 3, but the after romance scene is quite touching.
10750527	10754810	Bonds006 says, Enchanted Arms for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
10754870	10756551	That has tons of guy-on-guy action.
10757091	10760033	I vaguely remember that, but I don't remember having tons.
10760073	10761374	I just remember it being one of the first.
10761454	10763275	But anyway, we have more calls coming in, so let's get to them.
10763695	10764736	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
10764756	10765096	Who's this?
10768547	10769791	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10769811	10770493	We can't hear you.
10771977	10772278	Hello?
10775366	10776286	I heard a click.
10776426	10776746	Hello?
10776766	10777846	Wait, did you hear me?
10778006	10778747	Yes, we do now.
10778767	10778807	Hi.
10778827	10779527	Who's this?
10779547	10780547	Yeah, damn, mic switch.
10780587	10781147	Gotta love those.
10781368	10781728	That's all right.
10781748	10782688	Xenocore from the OKC.
10782708	10783248	How you guys doing?
10783308	10784529	Hey, how you doing, Xenocore?
10784549	10786029	See, I knew you knew how to work your Skype.
10786049	10787089	It just had to be something like that.
10787129	10787390	All right.
10787690	10788370	What's on your mind, buddy?
10789210	10790090	Not much of it.
10790311	10794912	I purchased Arkham City finally because I said, screw it, I'm not going to get any DLC anyway.
10795612	10797233	And it's ruined gaming for me now.
10797333	10800474	I can't play half the other games because it's not as satisfying.
10802046	10803227	Arkham City is just that fucking good.
10803247	10805750	Like it raised the bar that high that now everything else sucks.
10818317	10819318	Asylum is better.
10845868	10850311	Well, I guess just the way it goes, you actually feel like you're really whooping ass.
10850812	10853714	I mean, everybody knows this about Arkham City and Arkham Asylum anyway.
10853734	10863140	This isn't new news, but the fact that nobody else has done this in any other game yet is freaking annoying to me.
10863240	10867063	I finally upgraded my POS computer to something that's near top of the line.
10867543	10873127	I play Arkham City, and now I can't play half the other action or RPG games on it because they all suck.
10874053	10874373	DarkSakura
10904252	10906253	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10924348	10925589	I'm not paying attention to those.
10926189	10926670	We'll see.
10926770	10928811	But that combat engine is unique.
10928891	10933255	It's not going to work in anything that's that large because it's tied together.
10933555	10941302	Like the combat from way back when, from the game Oni, when that first came out on a PS2, that combat system was amazing.
10941342	10943663	But the way they built it, you couldn't do anything else with it.
10943683	10946446	There's no multiplayer or anything because of the way they glued it together.
10946506	10946626	So,
10948009	10952564	I think Arkham City and Arkham Asylum that style of gameplay is going to be stuck in that.
10953066	10954350	Have you checked out any of the DLC yet?
10955587	10956348	I'm not going to.
10957088	10959230	Robin, Nightwing, whatever.
10961611	10963472	All I need is a big bat and cat woman and I'm good.
10963733	10964413	That's interesting.
10964673	10969817	I don't know why, but I find that very interesting that even though you love the game so much, you're like, nah, I don't really need to do the DLC.
10970117	10976481	Because for me, I probably will have to play all that Mass Effect DLC at some point just because I'm getting so into this.
10978322	10979343	Mass Effect DLC.
10981304	10982125	Jesus, man.
10982945	10983946	What a racket that was.
10984046	10985167	Have you played the Mass Effect DLC?
10986527	10992189	No, because my roomie, he bought the game when it released, and he was going to ruin it for me.
10992269	10999432	So after seeing what actually rewards you get, it's like beating Rygar, but not doing it in an old school way.
10999692	11003753	The old school Rygar ending was something you got because you fucking earned it.
11004233	11008515	Everybody can get to the ending in this game, and it's going to be a piece of shit, so why bother?
11008535	11009655	I'm not going to pay for it.
11009795	11012696	That's a classic 8-bit game I really need to try and do start to finish.
11012936	11017558	Yeah, Vigar was two screens and one of them had some animation on it.
11017618	11018098	That's it.
11018298	11023060	But that game was so freaking hard you were glad to see that screen because not many people get to see it.
11023880	11024321	Seriously.
11025241	11030443	They're just going to slap a patch top of Mass Effect 3 to explain the ending apparently.
11031703	11038166	They're not going to actually make it to where you actually steer the character in one of three directions without making a single choice at the end.
11038846	11040388	which ruins the whole experience for me.
11040428	11042830	So, nah, they're not getting any of my money for that series anymore.
11043811	11044111	All right.
11044752	11046954	Any last thoughts before we let you go tonight, Xenocore?
11047294	11048315	Yeah, to DarkSakura.
11048355	11049997	Let that Tussin soak in there, girl.
11050317	11053200	Remember, put some water in it, shake it up, more Tussin.
11053480	11054060	Tough it out.
11054160	11054561	All right, no.
11055242	11055962	Hopefully she's listening.
11056002	11056603	I hope she heard that.
11056943	11057203	All right.
11058064	11058685	Take care, buddy.
11059185	11059385	Later.
11059566	11059946	All right, bye.
11059966	11060026	Bye.
11064267	11092488	1877 game OLR username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio I guess we can try and squeeze in one more call we're getting a lot of calls tonight so I'm going to really try and fit in one more call here before we say goodnight meanwhile I need to read tweets I have been totally ignoring the Twitters at twitter.com slash OLR but let me read some tweets for you right now no I'll take a call then we'll do tweets this will be the last call tonight hi who's this
11093359	11094799	Yeah, it's Legend of Zaku here.
11095020	11095980	Hey, Zaku, what's up?
11096920	11103842	Yeah, me and Adam, or Ranma, as we would aptly call him, we all went to PAX together.
11103882	11105383	Hell, we even roomed together.
11106063	11106343	Nice.
11106703	11107103	How was it?
11107123	11108664	How did you enjoy PAX East?
11109284	11110965	It was almost a...
11113336	11113936	Thank you for watching!
11136437	11146041	Stuff like the harmonics panel on Saturday, when they actually explained the whole process as to how Rock Band Blitz became, actually gone about.
11146582	11148723	Like, it actually started off as a prototype.
11150283	11159908	And, you know, within, this was a prototype that was done within the course of at least three years, even though it didn't pick up full steam until last summer.
11161004	11186861	So it basically went through several iterations where, for example, they actually did a lot in terms of trying to figure out the proper controls, seeing that they proposed so many ideas and solutions that most of them ended up failing until they found the one that worked, which is basically either the joystick using the D-pads and the buttons or the shoulders,
11187861	11189782	Just to hit both notes.
11190622	11199805	And then the whole notion of having, whether or not to make it just like frequency and amplitude in terms of shifting you from one instrument to another automatically.
11200425	11206287	So it deviates from that in the sense that you can just play any, you can stick with one completely.
11207348	11212870	Like I tried it today and I was pretty much bouncing from one track to the other within the song.
11213888	11226941	So, you know, coupled with the fact that you could just do mostly power-ups that you gain as you obviously hit more notes, then it just basically, it's almost like Audiosurf, but in the sense that everything's structured.
11227541	11232886	More importantly, everything is, it's just binary in the sense that...
11235959	11236881	No, no, no.
11237221	11237862	That wasn't there.
11237922	11245876	I'm pretty certain Prime will probably... That depends if the developers get themselves a booth for Prime.
11245916	11247739	But back to the point, it's like...
11249509	11275367	Back in the days of Amplitude, it was pretty much the same way, but the fact that the songs themselves are of a rock nature, where it's not like techno, and this is one of the questions that was brought up in the panel, I guess the rationale was it's easier to just release a product in which, on day one, people who are existing rock band users and consumers
11276127	11281169	could just start playing right away with their current collection.
11281229	11300417	Whereas if they added things that normally wouldn't fit into that rock band caliber, like a techno trance song that made Frequency and Amplitude pretty much a cult classic, then folks would have to start all over from scratch.
11301461	11305963	Let me try to get away from the rock band stuff for a minute because we've seen so much about it on the internet.
11306063	11307283	What other panels did you get to?
11308024	11312625	Alright, the other ones... Let me see.
11312905	11313886	The Kotaku panel.
11313986	11319028	That was on Friday where everyone in that panel was taking it over for an hour.
11319728	11323550	So I just threw out one little question in terms of...
11325010	11327412	Sort of like an inside thing in Kotaku.
11328213	11335418	If you were really in the site, you would actually know all their sections, how they have their own blocks of stories.
11335438	11336899	Wait, they let anyone have a panel?
11337119	11341603	They clearly are letting anyone have a panel, so I want an OLR panel at PAX Prime.
11342711	11346773	Yeah, but they had folks writing stories within the hour.
11346793	11348094	Was it a workshop?
11348514	11357338	They had people actually air their grievances in terms of banning people or actually taking pictures and so forth.
11357358	11358919	There was even live blogging.
11359199	11359960	That's productive.
11360080	11364202	Open the floor back up to the people banned from a website.
11364222	11366463	Did they suck their own dick in front of all you guys too?
11368208	11377300	No, it's like... What happened was the editors, or actually the former editor of Kotaku, was spearheading the panel.
11377340	11382167	So the idea was that folks would just pitch their story ideas.
11382988	11383889	And the audience...
11385376	11391743	The audience would actually pick the ones that they would want to hear about.
11392223	11397829	And within that hour, they would have to actually write an article for it.
11397869	11401233	Did they have a big gong and did somebody judge people?
11403130	11408213	Yeah, the editors, obviously, the editing team was pretty much making sure everything was there.
11408373	11413457	All right, no disrespect, but I could give two shits about the Kotaku panel, so tell me about another one.
11414117	11429567	All right, the other one caught the tail end of the Epic panel, where Cliffy B basically was just going off for questions in the audience, one of which was a girl actually trolled
11430492	11434678	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
11445532	11449034	And then she was promptly arrested in the state of Arizona for trolling the panel.
11449114	11449875	It was amazing.
11450275	11454477	Alright, but the last one I caught was basically a classic arcade panel.
11454918	11456739	How do you have my interest?
11457079	11462182	In PAX, they have an actual classic arcade room.
11462282	11464163	Nothing but old arcade machines.
11464843	11465764	I love that room.
11466284	11471968	The folks from ACAM, the American Classic Arcade Museum, actually ran the panel with...
11472648	11481679	with a couple of developers who actually worked on the original older arcade titles, one of which was Food Fight and Ms.
11481719	11488367	Pac-Man, and then the third one was a developer for the Cruisin' series.
11489128	11489628	That is awesome.
11489648	11492612	So they were going through how back in the day they were like,
11494059	11494740	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11510871	11511432	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
11529948	11532549	and to the point where it leads up to the crash.
11532749	11534270	We're running long here, Zaku.
11534310	11540072	Let me just quickly ask you your favorite thing about the whole con.
11540592	11541433	Certain prizes.
11541713	11542133	Swag.
11542553	11543294	Swag.
11544174	11544554	Free shit.
11544614	11545414	It's a great thing.
11545494	11551237	I played Battlefield 3 in a mini tournament and all I got was a 4 gig USB drive.
11551917	11552037	Hey!
11552077	11552177	Hey!
11568328	11570909	And we're just saying me and Adam had ourselves a kick-ass time.
11571049	11573450	Alright, Zaku, I gotta let you go, but I'm glad you had a great time.
11573550	11575870	Actually, I'm a little jealous, but I guess I'm happy.
11576250	11577711	Alright, take care, Zaku.
11578351	11578971	Alright, have a good one.
11579051	11579331	Later.
11580132	11581232	Some things haven't changed.
11581252	11584133	All this coming out of people's MIT dorm rooms.
11584993	11585794	and DarkSakura.com.
11609409	11617605	Redertainment tweeted us saying Bank of America tried to foreclose on homes in a state that they don't have the right to operate in How did EA win worst company?
11618266	11619789	Because it's the internet
11620071	11621312	Lo, lo, lo, lo, lo.
11623452	11626153	DarkTetsuya says, the hunt at OLR is heating up.
11626534	11628174	Your next challenge starts this week.
11628274	11630595	It might be a little different from what you're expecting.
11631015	11631696	Go play the hunt.
11631716	11632816	Go get your score in Joust.
11632856	11635017	He said he'll extend it to like Tuesday or Wednesday.
11635157	11636357	I know what I'm doing on the bus tonight.
11636418	11636938	There you go.
11637918	11639139	You can work it on your iPhone.
11639619	11639999	Exactly.
11640039	11640899	It's not restricted.
11640959	11642500	It's kind of like an on your honor thing.
11642540	11644901	Like if you go and Photoshop something, you're just a dick.
11645021	11647422	And don't play in our competition just to be a dick.
11647782	11648303	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
11670945	11679748	Activision Blizzard has been sued for patent infringement of Virtual Worlds usage due to World of Warcraft and Call of Duty.
11680248	11682769	They're being sued by Worlds Inc.
11683469	11684249	Worlds Inc.
11684429	11687790	claims that World of Warcraft and Call of Duty are violating the patent.
11688591	11696073	"...technologies created by Worlds have helped the business of Virtual Worlds and gaming and the sale of virtual goods to grow into a multi-billion dollar industry."
11696573	11697954	This is the second time they've done this.
11697974	11700455	They filed suit against NCSoft in 2008 for City of Heroes.
11700475	11702436	It was dismissed after an undisclosed settlement was obtained.
11720464	11720884	World's Inc.
11720904	11722165	has been in business since either 99 or 2000.
11722245	11725547	I actually know of them.
11725627	11738856	I've heard the name too, but to say they're responsible for World of Warcraft and Call of Duty, it's kind of like, dude, I think copyright law online especially needs to be updated because things have changed since the Revolutionary War.
11740116	11740917	Just slightly.

11846149	11847670	to help spread the word about the show.
11848010	11849470	So please tell a friend or two.
11849831	11852072	And then maybe we can get that panel someday.
11852132	11859675	Although honestly, I would much rather have a panel let some of those guys who founded the way from the classic arcade games of the past sit in.
11859755	11860675	I just want to hear them talk.
11861115	11863556	So have a great night, everybody.
