26000	29000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	33000	Hello my friends out there on the internet
33000	35000	And welcome back to another week of the show
35000	37000	Where every gamer has a voice
37000	39000	Orange Lounge Radio

49000	51000	Not with Dark Sakura
51000	53000	Or Jamie Summers, sadly
53000	54000	She is not here tonight
54000	56000	We had to make a last minute cancellation tonight
56000	57000	Because she's not feeling well
57000	58000	So we hope she feels better
58000	61000	She's got like a science fiction double feature
61000	64000	She has a sinus infection double feature
64000	66000	Her sinus infection could be science fictional
66000	68000	It could be
68000	69000	She sounded like hell
69000	70000	Let's just put it that way
70000	72000	She sounded like goddamn hell
72000	74000	And you did not want her on the show tonight
74000	76000	Also, Tech Master Lowkey
76000	78000	Is not here tonight
78000	80000	He's doing Easter stuff
80000	82000	With his Jewish wife
82000	83000	I don't know how that works
83000	84000	Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
84000	85000	No, I
85000	87000	It's obviously a holiday for the family
87000	89000	So they're doing stuff with their kid
89000	90000	And all that
90000	92000	So there's no Dark Sakura
92000	93000	There's no Lowkey
93000	94000	But there's me
94000	95000	Rob Roberts
95000	97000	And obviously you can hear over there
97000	98000	My loud ass
98000	100000	Interrupting
100000	101000	Excuse me, Alan
101000	102000	You dropped
102000	103000	I keep forgetting you dropped your handle
103000	104000	A couple weeks ago
104000	105000	It's too mouthy and wordy to say
105000	106000	Alright, well how you doing Alan?
106000	107000	I'm good
107000	108000	Alright
108000	109000	I haven't been on the show in a long time
109000	110000	You haven't
110000	111000	So I'm glad we have an opportunity
111000	112000	To have you on
112000	113000	Again tonight
113000	114000	Yes
114000	115000	For the listeners who haven't heard you
115000	117000	Why don't you give us a quick introduction
117000	118000	About yourself
118000	119000	And the types of games you like
119000	120000	And all that
120000	121000	Mid 30's
121000	124000	Been playing since the Atari 2600
124000	128000	Favorite console is the Super NES
128000	131000	Right now I'm playing a lot of PC games
131000	133000	Dragon Age, Orange
133000	134000	Dragon Age
134000	135000	Oranges
135000	136000	Not Oranges
136000	138000	Which would be weird
138000	139000	Mass Effect
139000	140000	And so on
140000	141000	Alright
141000	142000	And we live together
142000	143000	So
143000	144000	That's right
144000	146000	So you get to see me all the time
146000	147000	Yes
147000	148000	Alright
148000	149000	Um
149000	152000	We have to have a third co-host obviously
152000	154000	The Orange Country doesn't work without three co-hosts
154000	156000	Insert Ferret here
156000	157000	Alright
157000	158000	Say hello everybody
158000	159000	Welcome back
159000	161000	By the way to VX JasonXV
161000	162000	Or just Jason if you will
162000	164000	Is back with us tonight
164000	165000	Three weeks
165000	166000	Uh
166000	167000	Three weeks
167000	168000	Quite a better turnaround
168000	169000	Than the eight years that we were going on
169000	170000	About previously
170000	171000	I was gonna say
171000	172000	For somebody who lives in Denver
172000	175000	That's really good to be able to get to a show
175000	176000	Three weeks
176000	177000	It's like I got home on the train
177000	178000	Turned around
178000	179000	Took another one
179000	180000	And hey I'm back
180000	181000	Which is actually what happened
181000	182000	Pretty much
182000	184000	But now I don't know how much I can and can't say on the show
184000	186000	But I think I'm okay saying
186000	188000	You were trying to get like a job thing
188000	189000	Out here
189000	190000	And you got it
190000	191000	Yay
191000	192000	Congrats
192000	193000	So that's why you're back
193000	194000	Last time I was out here for my interview
194000	195000	And I'm still
195000	197000	I'm still kind of giving the company the chance to
197000	200000	Announce it because they make a pretty big deal out of it
200000	202000	But yeah I got the job offer
202000	203000	Monday night
203000	206000	I took Tuesday to pack and wrap up things at home
206000	207000	And tell my other job
207000	208000	Peace out guys
208000	209000	I'm on a train tomorrow
209000	210000	Love to give you two weeks
210000	211000	Two weeks notice
211000	213000	But that's not happening
213000	214000	So Monday
214000	215000	Monday night
215000	216000	Solidified everything
216000	217000	Tuesday night
217000	219000	Tuesday in general
219000	221000	Finished off everything that I needed to do
221000	223000	Wednesday morning on the train
223000	225000	And I've been here since
225000	226000	Just after business hours on Thursday
226000	228000	But there were no snakes on the train
228000	229000	So we're good
229000	230000	There were no snakes on the train
230000	231000	Alright that's good
231000	232000	That's good
232000	233000	Well welcome back
233000	234000	I'm glad you're able to be here
234000	236000	Especially on a week where we need a lot of people
236000	237000	But you have the
237000	239000	You have an awesome radio voice
239000	242000	So I'm happy you get to kind of step up and be a co-host tonight
242000	244000	So some folks might be wondering like
244000	245000	Well why
245000	247000	Okay Rob why would you do a show without Dark Sakura
247000	248000	And without Loki
248000	249000	And you know well
249000	252000	With no slight to Alan or Jason
252000	254000	Who are fine step in hosts tonight
254000	255000	But you know it is a little weird
255000	258000	That there's only one of the regular OLR hosts here
258000	259000	But remember guys
259000	261000	It is the show where every gamer has a voice
261000	263000	And it's not necessarily just about me
263000	264000	Or just about Jamie
264000	265000	Or just about Loki
265000	266000	It's about you guys
266000	268000	So we want to make sure that we would have a show here
268000	270000	And a place where you guys can interact
270000	271000	And still chat with us
271000	273000	I have to say I did take some inspiration
273000	276000	A little bit from what's going on over at Video Game Outsiders
276000	279000	Which is another show on the All Games Network that I listen to
279000	282000	And poor John's been holding down the fort over there for a while
282000	285000	Because his two co-hosts have had just other stuff going on
285000	286000	But they still do the show every week
286000	288000	So there's no reason we can't
288000	291000	We're actually not going to be here next week
291000	293000	That was a pre-planned thing
293000	296000	So we knew that Loki would be out tonight
296000	298000	But we thought Dark Sakura would be here
298000	299000	But of course people get sick
299000	300000	That happens
300000	301000	But we knew we would not be here next week
301000	304000	And we didn't want to go two weeks in a row with no show
304000	306000	So we have the show going tonight
306000	308000	And you guys can chat live with us
308000	311000	chat.orangeloungeradio.com
311000	314000	And AlphaKanandagram starts us off in the chatroom tonight saying
314000	318000	Yay weird show! Fuck yes!
318000	319000	Aww, but you guys
319000	323000	More like Brorange Lounge Radio, right?
323000	325000	I don't want you guys to feel like it's the weird show
325000	329000	I mean obviously Jason, you've been our webmaster for years and years
329000	333000	And you played Bamani games just like Dark Sakura, Loki and I did
333000	334000	Just at a different arcade
334000	339000	So I know you followed that scene probably longer than we did
339000	341000	But you were in all that stuff
341000	345000	And Alan, well Alan's cool too
345000	348000	Right
348000	352000	Alright, before we get into How Was Your Gaming Week and all that tonight
352000	356000	I thought we could talk a little bit about not just the weird oddities
356000	359000	Of having only one of the regular hosts here
359000	363000	But I mentioned next week we were going to not be here
363000	366000	Because I have a pre-planned trip
366000	369000	We're going to Disneyland, which I know shock and awe, dying of shock
369000	372000	Alan's coming with me of course because he does that
372000	377000	And we're going to the final ever electronica
381000	385000	But for those who didn't know, they turned California Adventure into
385000	388000	Like this whole, they turned a part of it, not the whole damn park
388000	392000	But they turned a little part of it into The Grid on like Friday and Saturday nights
392000	395000	And they did this back when the Tron Legacy movie first came out in theaters
395000	399000	And it got extended several times
399000	401000	I think it was only supposed to run for about 6 months the first time
401000	405000	It's been extended to like 18 months or even longer now
405000	407000	It's been about a year and a half since that movie came out
407000	411000	But one of the other cool things, and I know we've talked about it on the show before
411000	416000	Is that electronica also has a replica of Flynn's arcade from the movie
416000	420000	With classic 80's video games that are in great condition
420000	424000	Because you know it's Disneyland, they're not going to let shitty run down games into their park
424000	427000	And the one time I have seen a broken machine there
427000	430000	They had a dude out there fixing it in like 5 seconds
430000	433000	So we're going to go say goodbye to electronica
433000	435000	Because you know they made a business decision to get rid of it
435000	438000	Because Tron the movie again is a year and a half old now
438000	441000	We don't know if they're going to be doing a sequel
441000	444000	Although there is the anime that's supposed to be out in summer or fall
444000	447000	So it seems weird to me that they're not going to have awareness for that
447000	451000	But they're replacing it with the mad tea party
451000	454000	And that's tea as in just the letter T
454000	457000	Not as in a sippy drink that British people have at lunchtime
457000	459000	Where's failed trombone? Do you have it queued up?
459000	461000	I can get failed trombone queued up
461000	462000	It's too late
462000	463000	Why are you
469000	471000	And you're upset about the mad tea party
471000	473000	Like you're personally offended right
473000	477000	We saw that movie and I didn't think it was going to be very good
477000	479000	And you were very optimistic
479000	482000	It'll be okay it's Tim Burton and it was shitty
482000	484000	I didn't like it at all
484000	487000	I know some people were into it but no I didn't like it at all
487000	490000	But here's the thing and the reason why I bring it up
490000	493000	Is that unfortunately with electronica changing over to the mad tea party
493000	495000	They're going to close Flynn's arcade
495000	499000	Now supposedly the mad hatter is supposed to have some type of arcade
499000	503000	But I don't believe that means he's keeping the 80's retro games
503000	507000	From what I hear they're supposed to be like skee-ball
507000	511000	And it's what happened to every other arcade from the 80's
511000	514000	They're now birthday kid palace
514000	516000	Where the machines spit tickets and all that stuff
516000	519000	Although I heard the mad tea party won't even give you tickets
519000	522000	It's just playing skee-ball for the sake of playing skee-ball
522000	524000	Which is weird and absurd to me but whatever
524000	528000	Disney Imagineers if you want to listen to me for a very awesome idea
528000	532000	You should fix the bootsy run down arcade off of space mountain
532000	534000	And put Flynn's arcade there
534000	535000	And it will be super awesome
535000	538000	Exactly and tomorrow lands a great fit for it
538000	540000	Or just fucking bulldoze interventions
540000	543000	Cause who goes in the interventions building like ever
543000	545000	And just make a giant Tron grid
545000	549000	It would only cost like $11 billion and it would be amazing
549000	552000	But my hope is, here's my secret hope
552000	556000	I have a secret wish hope pie in the sky idea
556000	560000	And that is that maybe if we go to the last electronica
560000	563000	They're going to give away some of the arcade games
563000	565000	You get an arcade machine
565000	566000	You get an arcade machine
566000	569000	Everybody gets an arcade machine
569000	571000	In reality that fucking won't happen
571000	574000	Because I think they're leasing them from a local company
574000	575000	That specializes in this shit
575000	577000	But hold on I want my idea
577000	579000	I want my pie in the sky idea
579000	582000	And that is that they're going to give away these machines
582000	588000	So I was thinking about if you could have a retro arcade machine in your house
588000	591000	What arcade machine would you want to have in your house
591000	595000	If you could have something from Flynn's Arcade in your house
595000	597000	What game would you want
597000	599000	This is a tough one
599000	601000	Cause there's a lot of like great games
601000	603000	And part of me wants to say Dig Dug
603000	605000	Cause I'm actually pretty good at that one
605000	608000	Part of me wants to say BurgerTime
608000	610000	Because I damn near bought a-
610000	613000	I came so fucking close to buying a BurgerTime machine
613000	615000	Like not even a couple months ago
615000	617000	And then I realized I live in an apartment
617000	619000	And that would be a really shitty idea
619000	621000	To bring an arcade machine into the apartment
621000	623000	But you saw when I saw that BurgerTime machine Alan right
623000	625000	I was like I could forego getting an iPad
625000	627000	Your BurgerTime machine
627000	630000	And you're just rolling your eyes in the back of your head
630000	634000	But I think the machine I would really really want to have
634000	636000	I don't know why it's just
636000	638000	Is a spy hunter machine
640000	642000	Any of the racing games from that era
642000	644000	Cause they all had different like variety of pedals
644000	646000	Switches, different steering wheels
646000	649000	Like All Points Bulletin was actually one of my favorites
649000	651000	From that time period
651000	653000	Or at least that's how my brain seems to relate it
653000	656000	I think I just have a lot of memories of Spy Hunter as a kid
656000	657000	Because that's what they had
657000	658000	Okay shut up
658000	660000	It was at the local roller rink
660000	663000	That's where all the arcade games from my youth came from too
663000	665000	It was that or the pizza parlor
665000	667000	Pizza parlor was like a sit down
667000	669000	Either like a joust or a galaga or something like that
669000	672000	One of the two sided top sitting
672000	674000	It's probably a name for that I don't know what it is
674000	678000	So I want a Spy Hunter machine
678000	682000	I want Oprah to give me a Spy Hunter machine at the last electronica
682000	684000	Jason what arcade machine would you want?
684000	688000	You know I had one in mind
688000	690000	And then my brain replaced it with Neo Geo
690000	692000	So I kind of forgot what it was entirely
692000	696000	Not just Light Cycle Tron
696000	698000	But one of the I think it was like the
698000	700000	Movie Tron arcade machines
700000	702000	There were two Tron machines
702000	703000	There was Tron
703000	704000	It was just called Tron
704000	707000	And then there was Discs of Tron
707000	708000	And did that have
708000	710000	I think there's even a third one
710000	714000	Because there should have been one that had like the assault on the MCP and tanks
714000	716000	Tron was made up of four mini games
716000	718000	And I think you're just thinking they're all separate games
718000	722000	Wasn't Tron originally just a Light Cycles game?
722000	724000	That's one of the mini games
724000	725000	It's just the most popular one
725000	726000	There was Light Cycle game
726000	727000	There's the MCP cone
727000	728000	There's the tanks
728000	729000	And there's
729000	731000	I would probably say Discs of Tron
731000	732000	Discs of Tron
732000	734000	I would not mind more time with that game
734000	736000	I've only played it like once or twice
736000	737000	And it looked really good
737000	738000	It was very engaging
738000	739000	It was really fun
739000	743000	Alan, if you could steal one machine out of Flynn's arcade
743000	745000	Or excuse me, have Oprah give you one
745000	746000	Gift you one
746000	747000	What would you want her to give you?
747000	750000	Well I don't think it's in Flynn's arcade
750000	752000	But if I had to have a vintage cabinet in my house
752000	754000	It would have to be multiplayer
754000	756000	And it would have to have large cabinets
756000	757000	To set drinks on
757000	758000	And I would go with Golden Axe
758000	761000	Because that game is amazing
761000	764000	I think Golden Axe is better left in my memory
764000	767000	Like every time I've played Golden Axe
767000	770000	Not to just take a crap on what Alan said
770000	773000	Not this shitty port that was on Genesis
773000	774000	And is currently on XBLA or whatever
774000	776000	But the original arcade Golden Axe
776000	777000	With three people
777000	778000	It was a good time
778000	780000	It was good memories
780000	781000	It was good memories
781000	783000	God damn that goblin
783000	785000	Attack faster, come on
785000	786000	Awesome comments from our chat room
786000	788000	Chat.orangelaungeradio.com
788000	790000	Because everybody's joining in in the chat room
790000	791000	Love this
791000	792000	DDRdollabill says
792000	796000	Robotron2084 would be his game
796000	799000	Hands bloody fucking down
799000	801000	Brad from Pod Culture
801000	802000	Love this answer
802000	804000	This is one I would want too
804000	806000	Fucking Star Wars the arcade game
806000	807000	Good call
807000	808000	I completely forgot about that
808000	811000	I'm not even like a Star Wars aficionado
811000	812000	And all that
812000	814000	I mean I like the movies
814000	815000	I don't like obsess over them
815000	817000	I'm more of a Trekkie than a Warsie
817000	819000	But the arcade game
819000	821000	Was so fucking good
821000	822000	Is that the Vectrex one?
822000	823000	Yes
823000	825000	Did you know there was an Empire Strikes Back of that?
825000	826000	There was
826000	829000	I don't remember how official it was
829000	833000	But a buddy of mine that has a bunch of arcade machines down in his basement
833000	834000	Has it on a little
834000	837000	Not a ROM switcher but a cart switcher
837000	841000	And I was completely unaware that there was essentially a second Star Wars arcade
841000	842000	There was
842000	843000	There was
843000	844000	It was a little more complicated
844000	846000	But yes there was one
846000	847000	It was pretty awesome
847000	848000	Let's see
848000	849000	Tigerclaw on chat says
849000	850000	If they did that
850000	852000	Meaning handing out the arcade games
852000	855000	Rob would scream like a schoolgirl if he won an actual arcade
855000	856000	But then he'd be like
856000	858000	Wait a minute how am I supposed to get this thing out of here
858000	860000	I would tie it to the roof of my Honda
860000	861000	I don't even care
861000	863000	Go driving down by five
863000	865000	Catching all the bugs
865000	867000	Jim Sally says
867000	868000	Burger Time all the way
868000	869000	Burger Time for the win
869000	871000	Yeah I was almost there too
871000	873000	Stan says
873000	875000	Pac-Man but the small table version
875000	878000	Where both players sit at opposite ends of each other
878000	880000	A cocktail machine
880000	881000	Cocktail machine
881000	884000	Oh my god I'd love to have a cocktail machine
884000	885000	Those are hard to come by though
885000	888000	Cocktail machines are really sought after
888000	891000	Isn't that new Pac-Man game that came out that was incredibly expensive
891000	893000	That's the latest cocktail cabinet
893000	896000	It was definitely inspired by cocktail machines
896000	899000	Yeah I know it's not Pac-Man Championship Edition
899000	900000	But like an arcade
900000	901000	Pac-Man Battle Royale
901000	902000	I remember it had a funny name
902000	906000	And it's in Vegas and like New York and no where else or something
906000	909000	My Dave and Busters in Colorado had it
909000	910000	It was really fun
910000	911000	Rama says
911000	913000	Magic Sword
913000	915000	Oh good fucking call I love that one
915000	918000	That was the one they had at Round Table Pizza
918000	919000	That I would just play the shit out of
919000	920000	Pork Chop says
920000	922000	APB is awesome
922000	925000	Brad from Pod Culture also says
925000	927000	The original Gauntlet would be hella awesome
927000	929000	There's a good multiplayer game too
929000	931000	So good calls all around
931000	935000	Love the classic arcade game suggestions
935000	937000	We're going to be very sad when Electronica closes
937000	938000	But our plan
938000	940000	There's actually like a group of us going
940000	944000	Like I'm meeting up there with some of my friends from Warcraft
944000	945000	Nerd nerd
945000	948000	Some of my DDR friends from back in the day
948000	949000	Mel and Mel
949000	953000	Mr. Mel B who was a big DDR freestyler back in the day
953000	954000	Is going with us
954000	955000	It's going to be good
955000	958000	And our plan is to at the end of all of it
958000	961000	Yell end of line and then collapse into tears
961000	962000	Drunken tears
962000	965000	And I want to see Laser Man because I still haven't seen that shit
965000	967000	Laser Man will be there from what I understand
967000	969000	So there you go
969000	972000	Hey Dark Soccer joined our chat room
972000	975000	Hello Dark Soccer and said Dave and Busters in Roseville has it
975000	977000	So if you want to go play Pac-Man Battle Royale there you go
977000	978000	We haven't been there since
978000	979000	We haven't been there in a while
979000	983000	Yeah I think it's one of those things that's going to become a staple of Dave and Busters
983000	986000	Because it's not redemption but it kind of feels like it
986000	990000	And it's just a quick engaging game of Pac-Man
990000	994000	I'm thinking Dark Soccer should have a local birthday thingy thingy at Dave and Busters
994000	998000	Wink wink nudge nudge with her two gay besties
998000	1000000	If nothing else
1000000	1003000	Should have a Dave and Busters night
1003000	1006000	That would be fun wouldn't it Alan?
1006000	1007000	Yes
1007000	1008000	Alright
1008000	1012000	Anyhow that's enough for our reminiscing and retro arcade games
1012000	1015000	And we will not be here again next week
1015000	1018000	Our pal Bobby Black Wolf who we are usually after
1018000	1022000	At All Games Radio where we do tape live every Sunday night right after his show
1022000	1024000	At 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
1024000	1025000	He's been off for the past two weeks
1025000	1027000	He will be back next week
1027000	1030000	So at least live folks you have something to look forward to
1030000	1032000	Our 9 cast of course also live on Sunday nights
1032000	1034000	They will still be doing their thing
1034000	1036000	They've been constant over the past few weeks
1036000	1039000	So there will at least be those shows to look forward to but no OLR
1039000	1043000	We'll try to find a best up from the archives for you live folks
1043000	1045000	Maybe a rarity
1045000	1049000	I just came across a stockpile of episodes that aren't even up on the OLR archive
1049000	1052000	So maybe I'll dig one of those up and play that next week
1052000	1053000	It'll be fun
1053000	1056000	Meanwhile let's talk about our gaming weeks
1056000	1058000	And how was your gaming week?
1058000	1060000	I would usually say ladies first but there are no ladies
1060000	1064000	So Alan since you're within kicking range
1064000	1065000	Kick kick go
1065000	1066000	How was your gaming week?
1066000	1068000	I've been playing the Mass Effect trilogy
1068000	1071000	Inspired mostly in part by all of the wank
1071000	1074000	I got mad and bullshit over the ending of Mass Effect 3
1074000	1078000	I've had the first two games in my steam account thanks to those crazy sales
1078000	1083000	So I was like I'm gonna play these things and hopefully get to 3 at some point if I can buy it
1083000	1089000	So two or three weeks ago I beat Mass Effect 1 on both Paragon and Renegade
1089000	1093000	Which is sort of goody two shoes good guy and asshole good guy
1093000	1096000	And now I'm playing Mass Effect 2 and I'm ready to beat it
1096000	1099000	Like I just started the end game mission that's all very intense
1099000	1103000	The characters die and I had to save and quit to do the show
1103000	1107000	So we are literally taking you away from doing Mass Effect right now
1107000	1110000	Yes but that's all I've been playing for the last week
1110000	1111000	It's probably good to have a break once in a while
1111000	1114000	Microphone extension cords and headphones
1114000	1116000	No we need him to focus
1116000	1120000	He needs to be funny because we don't have Loki or Darth Sock tonight
1120000	1123000	So unless you want to be funny he has to bring the funny
1123000	1126000	Alright so that's it for you Mass Effect, Mass Effect and more Mass Effect
1126000	1130000	Now what are you going to do? Are you going to buy the third game or are you going to try to play the second one over again?
1130000	1134000	Well I'm doing my goody two shoes play through right now
1134000	1138000	So once I beat that then I'll load up my female femshep
1138000	1142000	And she's just like fuck you, fuck you, kill everybody and save the universe
1142000	1145000	And I don't give a shit because that's how she rolls
1145000	1148000	That's another 40 or 50 hours of gameplay
1148000	1155000	DarkSakura sent me her gaming week through proxy and she wants you all to know that she played a shitload of Portal 2 this past week
1155000	1159000	What a shock, yet has she touched that copy of Mass Effect I loaned her?
1159000	1160000	No
1160000	1163000	That's alright, Portal 2 is a pretty kickass game
1163000	1165000	Alright, Jason how was your gaming week?
1165000	1167000	Well as I kind of started to say at the top of the show
1167000	1172000	The first half of the week almost didn't exist for me with trying to get back out here
1172000	1178000	But I did load down my iPad for the train with games and I just kind of picked up some old favorites of mine
1178000	1182000	Death Rally has a modern iOS remake which is really fun
1182000	1186000	I picked that up again and started working through the missions again
1186000	1191000	Jetpack Joyride and then a couple of silly little things like Sudoku type games
1191000	1194000	Pickris type games
1194000	1201000	And I feel like I'm missing something significant but considering that consoles weren't really in the mix I don't think I was
1201000	1203000	Sometimes you have to game on the go
1203000	1204000	Yeah
1204000	1213000	And when you have 33 hours to do nothing but sit there and bounce to the left and to the right and back and forth and stumble through a narrow corridor
1213000	1216000	By which I just mean a train in real life
1216000	1218000	Yes, certainly
1218000	1220000	Go to our chatroom at chat.orangelandtrader.com
1220000	1224000	There's a lot of people talking about Mass Effect and lots of people getting into Mass Effect
1224000	1228000	AcidicVampire says everyone should play the Mass Effect series, end of story
1228000	1233000	A lot of folks saying they got the Steam deals going on there
1233000	1241000	Let's see, Dark Soccer is yelling at me saying girl I'm on my PC unless somebody wants to buy me Mass Effect 1 on Steam
1241000	1249000	Tigerclaw said I bought Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2 for $3.60 but you may want to wait until BioWare releases the patch that will fix the face import bug
1249000	1251000	Which is set to be released next week
1251000	1257000	Which is great because I won't get to Mass Effect 3 before next week so I will never have known that that was ever a problem
1257000	1264000	I just had someone on my Facebook a couple hours ago post that they finally beat Mass Effect 3
1264000	1269000	And of course they've already had the perspective of all the wank about the ending for the last two weeks
1269000	1273000	To I guess if they wanted to be pretentious and rise above that
1273000	1283000	And they said I have a lot of questions and it's not confusing at all and it's not really wrapped up into a neat little bow but they were satisfied with it
1283000	1287000	So they were like I don't get it, I don't get the rage
1287000	1290000	I heard it's one of those endings that makes you madder the more you think about it
1290000	1294000	So like maybe he's not mad today but next week he'll be like raging internet angry
1294000	1296000	Or 3am
1296000	1298000	WAIT WHAT
1298000	1301000	Waking up in a cold sweat DAMN YOU
1301000	1312000	I'm prepared to be let down by the ending of Mass Effect 3 but just the adventure from Mass Effect 1 and even I'm about halfway through Mass Effect 2 right now
1312000	1323000	Well I don't want to say 2 is so much better because 1 was awesome but if the last 20 minutes of the endgame rashetty for the whole trilogy
1323000	1332000	That franchise in my opinion has given me at least 100 hours of quality emotional rewarding gameplay
1332000	1335000	So it's not a waste of time
1335000	1340000	And of course there's going to be more DLC some of which obviously will come up a little later in the show when we get to news
1340000	1349000	So let's see my gaming week so Mass Effect for me as well just like Alan I got sucked into Mass Effect amongst all the chatter of Mass Effect 3
1349000	1356000	And Shane basically bullied me into playing Mass Effect like basically would threaten to kick me out of the WoW guild if I don't start playing Mass Effect or something like that
1356000	1361000	So I've been playing it, it's been amazing as I've talked about in previous weeks on the show
1361000	1366000	I'm just still cleaning up the loyalty missions and getting ready, I gotta catch up to where Alan's at
1366000	1371000	I have been playing a few other games though I want to tell you guys about, one of them is old and one of them is very new
1371000	1378000	The old one I want to talk about tonight is a game I got for $15 at Target it was on clearance
1378000	1380000	I might be partially responsible for this
1380000	1385000	Yes you were kind of an enabler you were like hey you should get this it's $15 and it has dance in it you'll like it
1385000	1391000	And I pick up the box and I'm like I think I heard about this game and I heard it was really basic
1391000	1397000	And I looked at the song list I'm like well if it's basic it still has a really great song list so I pick up a game called Dance Paradise
1397000	1401000	Which was $15 which was one of the early Kinect games
1401000	1402000	Is that THQ or Ubisoft?
1402000	1405000	I want to say it's THQ that did this one
1405000	1409000	Here's the thing Dance Paradise it has a really good song list
1409000	1417000	It's got like Lady Gaga it's kind of a euro infused song list it's like songs I think that were bigger a little bit bigger on the other side of the pond
1417000	1423000	Because you got things like Jerry Halliwell and nobody cared about the Spice Girls in America once they split up
1423000	1430000	But you know you got Lady Gaga you got a few Rihanna it's basically gay bar in a box right
1430000	1435000	And you know it's going to be good music because it's gay bar in a box and it's a great song list don't get me wrong
1435000	1442000	And it's also really cool because you get the little music videos actually play in the background while you're playing which not every game has
1442000	1452000	That was pretty cool but it's just it was so fucking basic like I don't know how else to describe this game
1452000	1457000	Like and the way you play it is really stupid like
1457000	1464000	Because you have to take a you start in the center and then to do a certain dance move you have to take a step to the left to do it
1464000	1467000	And then a step to the right and it's not the time warp
1467000	1472000	Yes exactly you jump to the left and step to the right but it's like Lady Gaga you're dancing to
1472000	1477000	Imagine it looks like rock band where you have like the four columns that notes fall down
1477000	1485000	Well you have to literally walk into each column in order to do the move and instead of falling notes you have falling dance moves
1485000	1491000	So maybe you're like doing a little disco or you're opening your arms back and forth or you know kind of a lot of the same stuff you see in Dance Central
1491000	1499000	But the fact that you move back for like who designed that that's just like that's not even that it's so weird
1499000	1506000	For those who play connect in a loft giant warehouse floor for all the room you need to play it
1506000	1511000	But here's the other thing that kind of disappointed me is that there was a good game in there somewhere
1511000	1518000	Because one of the things that was really cool about it was that some of the moves that you did mimicked the dance moves in the video
1518000	1524000	And I thought well that's that's a good thing to see in a music game is like learn to do the dance from the video that was really cool
1524000	1527000	Because Dance Central doesn't really even do that right and that's the king of the crop
1527000	1532000	You might see some like you'll definitely see like like for um oh
1532000	1534000	There's a little bit of booty and baby got back
1534000	1542000	Yeah there's that and then what the hell's that oh what's the goblin male dance what's that
1542000	1543000	Soulja Boy tell us
1543000	1550000	Soulja Boy okay thank you isn't it sad that that's how we communicate
1550000	1551000	We have problems
1551000	1554000	And unfortunately I know wow just enough to understand that too now
1554000	1560000	Okay Soulja Boy you do that dance in Dance Central so some of the big ones are there
1560000	1564000	But it doesn't like match the music video because Dance Central doesn't have the music videos
1564000	1567000	And Dance Central is still a lot of fun I mean it doesn't really matter
1567000	1575000	It kind of bothers me that like you have you have really good licenses and a really kick-ass song list in Dance Paradise
1575000	1580000	And then what was the other big competitor to Dance Central that came out
1580000	1581000	Dance Masters
1581000	1586000	Dance Masters the Konami game Dance Masters is actually beautifully put together if you think about it
1586000	1588000	It's just para para of Kinect right
1588000	1595000	Or even not not exactly there are three or four there are three or four
1595000	1596000	Wow
1596000	1603000	There are three or four songs on the list that are Eurobeat and do have para para routines
1603000	1607000	But everything else to the extent of my knowledge completely original
1607000	1614000	But it really is like fully fledged dance minus walking around a stage because Kinect is narrow tracking
1614000	1619000	A lot of them were like crossovers from DDR though they had a lot of DDR crossovers
1619000	1621000	Oh yeah everything was Konami original period
1621000	1628000	But the ones that weren't para para were very the routines were actually well they were fun to watch
1628000	1631000	Because I haven't exactly learned them yet but they were fun to watch
1631000	1639000	But there was some really weird weird crossovers though because like I remember one of the songs was Exotic Ethnic
1639000	1644000	Which I was trying to find in my my archive here but it's like it's not really a song you can dance to
1644000	1649000	I mean it's a DDR song it's a great DDR song because the way DDR structured
1649000	1653000	But now that we're kind of beyond the dance pad and in the whole like free movement
1653000	1657000	Exotic Ethnic doesn't make a very good dancey song
1657000	1665000	The routine from what I recall the little bits and pieces it like the song the song on DDR was like 200 beats per minute
1665000	1671000	I found it here we go so you can kind of see what this looks like here and hear this song and like see the routine
1671000	1682000	And realize it doesn't really work very well
1682000	1693000	What is up with the backup dancers this is like pg-13 here look at this
1693000	1698000	But anyway it's not a very like it's a good song like it was great back in the DDR days
1698000	1703000	But like to like freestyle move it's weird and it doesn't really like make sense
1703000	1707000	So here's the thing you've got a great interface and a great shell not even just dance masters
1707000	1711000	But say rhythm party right the game that just came out on Xbox Live Arcade
1711000	1715000	But not even the Bimani community seems to care about at this point
1715000	1719000	It's actually a really well put together game and I've said that for weeks on the show
1719000	1720000	There's a Bimani community
1720000	1723000	Yeah well you know what I mean I think there's a Bimani community
1723000	1725000	What's left of it? What's left of it?
1725000	1732000	So you've got that and then you have to it's like they need to learn something from each other
1732000	1739000	If you had rhythm party with Dance Paradise's song list you would have an amazing music game
1739000	1747000	Or if you had you know something that if Konami would just take the risk and license more than literally three licensed songs
1747000	1754000	Or if you know THQ would take the risk and spend a little more time designing a game that people actually want to play
1754000	1757000	And not just relying on the music to sell your game
1757000	1763000	If they would both take that risk there could be a legit competitor to Dance Central which kind of has both
1763000	1771000	But unfortunately both of them are looking to cash in a lot cheaper and don't want to take that financial risk which I can understand
1771000	1777000	Konami a lot of these a lot of these companies that are producing these are when it comes to music and rhythm
1777000	1780000	In my opinion they're mostly all on like the second tier
1780000	1788000	And Konami as far as American and European releases minus DDR has pretty much become that
1788000	1791000	Has gotten to that has driven themselves down to that point as well
1791000	1792000	Oh yeah
1792000	1793000	Notably starting with Rock Revolution
1793000	1794000	Harmonix is now the top tier
1794000	1797000	Harmonix is absolutely the top tier and Konami is now under them
1797000	1799000	Absolutely I would sign on to that
1799000	1801000	It's too bad but there you go
1801000	1807000	Anyhow so that was my big bloated Dance Paradise of a year and a half old game Dance Paradise there you go
1807000	1809000	And that was your gaming week
1809000	1815000	One other game I'm sorry I have to say it quickly quickly there's a new pinball game that came out on Xbox Live Arcade
1815000	1818000	And I don't even remember the name of it it's just called like pinball I think
1818000	1819000	Arcade pinball or something
1819000	1825000	Here's the thing though it's a bunch of classic tables it's it's the guys that made the like Williams pinball collection
1825000	1828000	And the Stern pinball collection like those games have already been out
1828000	1832000	They just basically ported it to Xbox Live Arcade but I see what they're doing they're piecemealing it
1832000	1836000	Because the game itself comes with four tables
1836000	1840000	It's four damn good tables it's Ripley's Believe It or Not which is a great table
1840000	1845000	Arabian Nights and Theater of Magic and Black Hole are all great tables
1845000	1852000	So it's like 800 Microsoft points for four like killer tables and then they're gonna do DLC later like Pinbot
1852000	1856000	The thing that they have that Pinball FX doesn't have is licenses
1856000	1861000	They're licensed with Stern and Williams so they're gonna get all those tables into their game
1861000	1866000	But if you already own the collections that came out on Xbox previously
1866000	1870000	I don't see the reason to get this whatsoever
1870000	1873000	But for those that missed it and want their game a little cheaper and more piecemeal
1873000	1876000	If you like pinball there's some great tables in there
1876000	1881000	And I don't remember Theater of Magic being in the collection so it's pretty cool that at least that game is there
1881000	1885000	Or if you're named Dark Soccer and just have all the tables in your house anyways
1885000	1888000	This may also not be for you as cheap as it as it is by comparison
1888000	1892000	Well I want to say Ripley's Believe It or Not was one of their like sought after tables that they wanted
1892000	1895000	So they can do a virtual version of it on the Xbox 360
1895000	1899000	Pinball Arcade says Zethur in the chatroom at chat.orangesauceradio.com
1899000	1905000	I knew it had a very very basic name to it so Pinball Arcade that's the name of it
1905000	1911000	Medieval Madness is DLC says Zethur and I know I saw Pinbot in the list which is one of my favorites
1911000	1917000	And you know they'll kind of do that so you know Pinball FX I like it a lot
1917000	1919000	It's got some great original tables
1919000	1922000	I'm glad to see there's a little healthy competition now with both of them being out there
1922000	1925000	And especially if you're a pinball fan it's a win-win situation
1925000	1931000	So you know if you somehow missed the collection last time this is definitely worth checking out
1931000	1933000	Alright now I'm done with my gaming week

1956000	1962000	Because there's so many dicks ruining the game experience on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network
1962000	1964000	We want to be different than that
1964000	1966000	There you go
1966000	1969000	Alright let's get into some actual gaming news
1969000	1971000	Jason why don't you start us off tonight
1971000	1979000	Harmonix has come full circle once again and is returning to its roots of a frequency amplitude inspired type of game
1979000	1987000	Again taken from the Rock Band franchise that they've been so excellent with over the past 5 years? 6 years?
1987000	1990000	I actually don't even know what year they really started with it anymore
1990000	1997000	They're returning to a frequency style layout with some very notable differences
1997000	2006000	There was a very famous point in amplitude and frequencies history where you could learn the exact track that you have to make to get the absolute max score
2006000	2012000	And Harmonix has responded to this by making Rock Band Blitz a slightly simpler game
2012000	2017000	One track per instrument and it was either 2 or 3 targets per instrument
2017000	2019000	I forget which
2019000	2028000	But the power ups aren't as track specific, the video is talking about a multi-measure automatic note auto player
2028000	2034000	And then there was like a wrecking ball that kind of bounced around tracks in a diagonal manner picking up notes along the way
2034000	2042000	And there's also no concept of a combo that you have to continually go on one measure to the next to extend the combo
2042000	2052000	And you can actually just jump from instrument to instrument and apparently it'll go a long way towards making a slightly unique sound
2052000	2057000	A slightly unique emphasis or you could just sit on your favorite instrument and play it the whole night
2057000	2068000	It sounds like it's going to use your entire back catalog so if you've been playing since Rock Band and you've imported everything from game to game
2068000	2076000	Plus all the DLC that you bought, all the Rock Band Network and what was the indie version of Rock Band Network?
2076000	2078000	That is Rock Band Network, yeah
2078000	2082000	Rock Band Store is the license, you know all that stuff
2082000	2086000	It's sounding like you should be able to have all of your official and indie content
2086000	2095000	No specific pricing and no specific import restrictions due out just yet but the game looks fun and it's always nice coming back to this style
2095000	2097000	I had a lot of fun with Rock Band Unplugged as well
2097000	2104000	It's interesting like I was partially really excited by the news, I have to admit a hint of disappointment
2104000	2108000	Because knowing that like this is the big project Harmonics has been working on
2108000	2113000	I have to express a teeny bit of disappointment because I was like oh I was kind of hoping for something new
2113000	2118000	But okay I mean it's really fucking hard to be disappointed when this sounds like a real powerhouse of a game
2118000	2123000	And the fact that it imports everything that's already on your drive, that's huge
2123000	2126000	What other company even keeps all your stuff like that anymore?
2126000	2130000	Exactly, like seriously what other company is going to give you that type of value?
2130000	2134000	Does EA own Harmonics at this point? No they don't, Harmonics is independent
2134000	2136000	They bought themselves out from MTV
2136000	2139000	I was like surely this is not behavior coming out of EA
2139000	2141000	Well that just proves Harmonics is independent
2141000	2148000	So yeah they're truly independent because they came off the MTV games, that was where they were at when Rock Band started
2148000	2158000	But just the value they're giving you there, it's so amazing coming off the weeks of us talking about how developers want to lock you out of used games altogether
2158000	2163000	Now it's like here's a game that enhances the value of all the DLC you've already bought
2163000	2166000	Like well fucking done, applause
2166000	2173000	This is, I mean I feel like an asshole for saying that I even expressed a hint of disappointment at this game
2173000	2179000	I'll definitely be picking it up day one, I mean now that I see kind of all the pieces and I'm like okay
2179000	2185000	I did like amplitude and frequency a lot, people did say they wanted a new frequency and amplitude
2185000	2193000	Even though this isn't really it, it's what they could get away with doing and know that it's going to be profitable
2193000	2196000	And so I'm excited for it, I am
2196000	2206000	I mean the way that I look at it is that we had the simple arcade style band
2206000	2212000	I'm trying to avoid the word simulation because the point is we had the arcade style music experience
2212000	2215000	And that was literally with like Guitar Freaks Dramania, the early Konami games
2215000	2219000	And then Guitar Hero came around, put it solely on the guitar
2219000	2222000	And then Rock Band came around and gave us the whole band
2222000	2227000	And then Rock Band 3 came around which gave us the pro controllers and everything else
2227000	2236000	Where you can use a no kidding digital drum kit and have an actual performing gear that you can actually plug in and use with the game
2236000	2240000	What else are they going to add into the Rock Band franchise that isn't going to be tacky as hell
2240000	2246000	And so instead to kind of go off the beaten path, whether they do something new which is hit or miss
2246000	2252000	Or they use this engine that was really fun and have all of your content like you just said
2252000	2254000	That's not a bad decision
2254000	2258000	I mean fucking how many songs have I bought on Rock Band
2258000	2262000	It is disgusting how much DLC I have on my Xbox 360
2262000	2267000	You're going to buy either a $30 or $40 game and you're going to import what $200 in content automatically
2267000	2271000	Rock Band Blitz is on Xbox Live Arcade, it's at most going to be $20
2271000	2273000	So maybe even $10
2273000	2274000	Probably less than $20
2274000	2277000	Well with 25 licensed songs or whatever it is they're doing
2277000	2280000	That in turn are going to play in Rock Band 3
2280000	2282000	Amazing!
2282000	2284000	We love you Harmonix
2284000	2286000	Who else is doing this?
2286000	2288000	You remember?
2288000	2292000	Okay remember like three years ago before Rock Band 3 came out
2292000	2294000	And they were talking about the Rock Band store
2294000	2298000	They were talking about how they wanted Rock Band to be like iTunes
2298000	2300000	Like it's iTunes for your consoles
2300000	2304000	And a lot of us kind of laughed it off and said oh yeah you're doing music
2304000	2306000	You're not the same as iTunes
2306000	2308000	iTunes is for your iPod
2308000	2311000	And downloading a song into Rock Band is not the same as iTunes
2311000	2313000	But now here we are years later
2313000	2315000	That's what they were setting the seeds for
2315000	2317000	Because now they've enhanced
2317000	2319000	You didn't just buy Rock Band DLC
2319000	2325000	You bought a song that functions in multiple ways on your console
2325000	2330000	That is starting to feel a little more like iTunes for your console, that's amazing
2330000	2333000	So like I said it's hard to be that upset
2333000	2335000	And deep down inside I kind of think
2335000	2339000	Rock Band Blitz is more of probably a side project
2339000	2341000	To something that's you know
2341000	2343000	Something that's really going on
2343000	2345000	I bet there's something else
2345000	2347000	I mean there was the iPhone stuff too
2347000	2349000	They had the vid rhythm or whatever that was called
2349000	2351000	The sampler video plus audio
2351000	2353000	Yeah the experimental thing
2353000	2356000	And maybe there'll be something else at E3 this year
2356000	2359000	Because they've announced this in time for PAX obviously
2359000	2362000	And you know we're showing it on the floor there
2362000	2364000	Maybe they've got something else to show at E3
2364000	2367000	Maybe they're working on something for the next wave of consoles
2367000	2369000	Maybe it's something for the Wii U, who knows
2369000	2375000	So again my disappointment is like one grain of sand
2375000	2379000	In a oh my god I can't wait to eat this delicious cake
2379000	2381000	It's gonna be amazing
2381000	2383000	And actually if anybody's interested
2383000	2387000	I believe they're based out of Massachusetts
2387000	2392000	When I was job hunting a couple people pushed me in their direction
2392000	2394000	But I didn't really want to relocate
2394000	2397000	But if you are willing to and you're interested
2397000	2399000	They actually had a lot of positions available
2399000	2402000	Anything from creative to programming to design
2402000	2404000	I think even like program management that kind of stuff
2404000	2406000	If you're interested look them up
2406000	2408000	That's all I have to say
2408000	2412000	As Rob stuffs his face full of popcorn
2412000	2414000	Dead air
2414000	2416000	I thought I had a break to eat
2416000	2418000	Bad co-host
2418000	2420000	It's alright you're learning
2420000	2422000	Learning
2422000	2424000	You have to learn how to fill in those gaps
2424000	2426000	So I can be a fat ass
2426000	2428000	You'll get there
2428000	2430000	Alright anyhow
2430000	2432000	Well let me ask Alan you've been awfully quiet on that story
2432000	2435000	I mean I know you're not like as huge in the music games as the rest of us
2435000	2439000	But surely that whole enhanced value thing is kind of making you go hmm
2439000	2441000	Yeah I've kind of been abstaining because
2441000	2443000	Rock band and that whole genre
2443000	2445000	Guitar Hero
2445000	2447000	I never really
2447000	2449000	Was into it at all
2449000	2453000	But it sounds like what they're doing with this new Blitz game is amazing so
2453000	2457000	You don't like watching your friends get drunk and sing Lady Gaga and make asses out of themselves?
2459000	2461000	Eh
2461000	2463000	You could get that before there was rock band
2463000	2467000	I don't have a smart phone with a camera to put it on Facebook so
2467000	2469000	If I can't blackmail you then
2469000	2471000	Then where's the fun in that
2471000	2473000	Alright well another game was announced just this past week
2473000	2475000	It's a game
2475000	2477000	It's a reimagining of an old game
2477000	2479000	We've seen a few of these lately
2479000	2481000	WayForward the company that brought us
2481000	2483000	What the hell did they bring?
2483000	2485000	There was another
2485000	2487000	God dammit they did blood rain
2487000	2489000	I think blood rain betrayal was one of their games they did
2489000	2491000	There's another one I was trying to think of
2491000	2493000	They are now taking over the Double Dragon franchise
2493000	2495000	I had no idea that it was up for grabs
2495000	2497000	But it makes sense
2497000	2499000	Majesco was the ones that got the Double Dragon franchise
2499000	2501000	Who had it before?
2501000	2503000	I'm trying to remember
2503000	2505000	Trade West
2505000	2507000	Maybe Midway had it and it was one of the things that went under
2507000	2509000	When they went under
2509000	2511000	But Majesco got the Double Dragon franchise
2511000	2513000	So it's being reinvented as
2513000	2515000	Double Dragon Neon
2515000	2517000	Which is going to come out on Xbox Live
2517000	2519000	And Playstation Network
2519000	2521000	Why did they call it Double Dragon Neon?
2521000	2523000	Well because it is
2523000	2525000	80's-tastic
2525000	2527000	The colors
2527000	2529000	The colors are the best
2529000	2531000	around
2531000	2533000	Hopefully that can be in the game
2533000	2535000	But I don't know. There is a trailer
2535000	2537000	Let me play some of this for you
2537000	2539000	Because it does have some nice remix music
2539000	2543000	And you can notice
2543000	2545000	The way the characters move
2545000	2547000	Is very fluid and all that
2547000	2549000	You know it looks really nice
2549000	2551000	In HD
2551000	2553000	Yeah that is pretty
2553000	2555000	Beyond pastel-tastic
2555000	2557000	Yeah and everybody is very 80-infused
2557000	2559000	Like you see the afros
2559000	2561000	And the leather jackets
2561000	2563000	And the boots with the fur on them and all that stuff
2563000	2565000	You know call me crazy
2565000	2567000	Or call me stupid if this already happened
2567000	2569000	But you know what I'd love to see a
2569000	2571000	Very modern remake of in this style
2571000	2573000	Captain America and the Avengers
2573000	2575000	Well especially when there is the movie and everything
2575000	2577000	But I think they did another game for that
2577000	2579000	Here is my concern with Double Dragon Neon
2579000	2581000	Okay I bought Double Dragon
2581000	2583000	When it was available on Xbox Live Arcade
2583000	2585000	It is not available anymore obviously
2585000	2587000	But it was available on Xbox Live Arcade for a short time
2587000	2589000	When you know other people had the license
2589000	2591000	We played it together and we did
2591000	2593000	We did
2593000	2595000	And then Darkstakers Dan yelled at us for trashing it
2595000	2597000	I remember that
2597000	2599000	Yes because we played through it and we were like
2599000	2601000	This game isn't very good
2601000	2603000	What the hell were we smoking when we were 12
2603000	2605000	This game sucks
2605000	2607000	And now I'm looking at this going
2607000	2609000	It looks like it's a faithful port
2609000	2611000	Of the original Double Dragon game
2611000	2613000	But Double Dragon
2613000	2615000	Maybe I'm just old but it kind of gets old
2615000	2617000	After the first stage
2617000	2619000	You're like punch punch
2619000	2621000	Kick kick kick and I'm over it
2621000	2623000	What Double Dragon
2623000	2625000	Founded Final Fight made better
2625000	2627000	And I'd rather play that
2627000	2629000	But even playing Final Fight now
2629000	2631000	Playing any of those old fighting games just doesn't feel the same
2631000	2633000	Better dudes
2633000	2635000	They're all the same
2635000	2637000	It would be cool if they could incorporate some of what we see
2637000	2639000	In new fighting games a little bit
2639000	2641000	Maybe more like versus
2641000	2643000	And special moves and combo attacks
2643000	2645000	Oh god
2645000	2647000	Don't give them ideas
2647000	2649000	But I will
2649000	2651000	I'll at least check out the demo
2651000	2653000	So that's coming out this summer
2653000	2655000	So what you're saying is
2655000	2657000	You want them to bring back that mode from
2657000	2659000	Tekken Tag Tournament
2659000	2661000	Actually that mode kicked ass
2661000	2663000	So yes I want them to bring that back
2663000	2665000	It was a little bit more fun
2665000	2667000	Because there was the entire moveset
2667000	2669000	And a little bit more depth to a side scroller
2669000	2671000	And you could play it as panda
2671000	2673000	And the concept of a fighting game where a panda bear
2673000	2675000	Beats up everyone
2675000	2677000	Is pretty fucking awesome you have to admit
2677000	2679000	I think they brought that out it's just not a side scroller
2679000	2681000	Oh right!
2681000	2683000	Wow did
2683000	2685000	Panda kills everyone
2685000	2687000	Anyhow
2687000	2689000	Wow reference number 5 today
2689000	2691000	Keep that number going
2691000	2693000	Yeah sorry
2693000	2695000	Sorry guys
2695000	2697000	So for Pokemon fans and SRPG fans
2697000	2699000	Nintendo of America
2699000	2701000	Is bringing Pokemon
2701000	2703000	And Nobunaga's
2703000	2705000	Ambition
2705000	2707000	What?
2707000	2709000	Nobunaga's Ambition
2709000	2711000	Nobunaga
2711000	2713000	Cowabunga
2713000	2715000	Cowabunga?
2715000	2717000	They're bringing that to the US
2717000	2719000	Called Pokemon Conquest
2719000	2721000	And it's coming out on June 18th
2721000	2723000	And you play a warlord
2723000	2725000	Who has a Pokemon
2725000	2727000	PAL and you have to build up your army
2727000	2729000	And it's skirmish based and it's an SRPG
2729000	2731000	And if you follow import games
2731000	2733000	And
2733000	2735000	You're a fan of
2735000	2737000	Nobunaga's Ambition
2737000	2739000	This is great
2739000	2741000	You know I remember when I heard
2741000	2743000	That this game was coming out in Japan
2743000	2745000	Like what a weird fucking idea
2745000	2747000	And to hear that this game
2747000	2749000	Is actually coming out here
2749000	2751000	I have mixed emotions
2751000	2753000	Look I get it
2753000	2755000	Pokemon has it's rabid fan base
2755000	2757000	That will buy almost anything that ties into Pokemon
2757000	2759000	Like I'm totally
2759000	2761000	Like I understand that fine
2761000	2763000	But how on earth
2763000	2765000	Does the US get
2765000	2767000	Pokemon and Nobunaga's Ambition
2767000	2769000	Relatively close to the Japanese release
2769000	2771000	You know within a year yes I would call close
2771000	2773000	To this yet we had to pull
2773000	2775000	Out fucking teeth to get
2775000	2777000	Xenoblade
2777000	2779000	Is this an
2779000	2781000	Example of maybe
2781000	2783000	I mean I guess technically it wasn't
2783000	2785000	A Nintendo game because Tecmo designed it
2785000	2787000	Maybe that's the key difference
2787000	2789000	Because Pokemon just shits
2789000	2791000	Money and it's the Pokemon factor
2791000	2793000	I mean it's
2793000	2795000	Even if the whole feudal warlord fails
2795000	2797000	To grab onto people it can still be
2797000	2799000	Propped up and kept afloat
2799000	2801000	At least a little bit more with something like
2801000	2803000	Oh I don't know a Pokemon franchise
2803000	2805000	Which is insanely popular
2805000	2807000	As opposed to a
2807000	2809000	I'm not going to say an underground favorite
2809000	2811000	But definitely a less trafficked
2811000	2813000	Series in the Zen of Years
2813000	2815000	Zen of Sagas and of course
2815000	2817000	Why?
2817000	2819000	I understand why they changed the name
2819000	2821000	Because you don't exactly have your
2821000	2823000	Raving Nobunaga Ambition fans here
2823000	2825000	In the US I mean there was that
2825000	2827000	They had like a few of them on the NES
2827000	2829000	Like Nobunaga and Romance of the
2829000	2831000	Three Kingdoms and some of that but
2831000	2833000	That series has kind of been deader than dead here
2833000	2835000	For years or at least I think it exists on the
2835000	2837000	PC it definitely has like a cult
2837000	2839000	Following but nothing mainstream
2839000	2841000	So I get why they
2841000	2843000	Changed the name but you know there's going to be those purists
2843000	2845000	Though there's always some goddamn purist who's
2845000	2847000	Going to be like why couldn't they just call
2847000	2849000	It Pokemon Nobunaga
2849000	2851000	They think it's they dumbed it down for stupid Americans
2851000	2853000	Stupid Americans
2853000	2855000	Get off your goddamn horse
2855000	2857000	They changed it for Americans indeed
2857000	2859000	Yes they did change it for Americans
2859000	2861000	Because we don't have like two
2861000	2863000	New Nobunaga Ambition games coming
2863000	2865000	Out on consoles every year like they do
2865000	2867000	In Japan wake up
2869000	2871000	It's fucking amazing this game
2871000	2873000	Is coming out here in the first place that's basically my point
2873000	2875000	And it sounds like it has six on six
2875000	2877000	Battles and
2877000	2879000	Battle conditions can change on every turn
2879000	2881000	Keeping players on their toes in anticipation
2881000	2883000	Of what will happen next
2883000	2885000	Me me me me me me
2885000	2887000	Fancy pants reading of the quote
2887000	2889000	And this article from Scott Moffett
2889000	2891000	Nintendo of America's executive vice president
2891000	2893000	Of sales and marketing
2893000	2895000	Pokemon fans are always
2895000	2897000	Interested in playing in new
2897000	2899000	Environments and experiencing new
2899000	2901000	Adventures. Pokemon conquest
2901000	2903000	Gives them an entirely new way
2903000	2905000	To enjoy this beloved series
2905000	2907000	With exciting new settings
2907000	2909000	Fierce battles and nearly 200
2909000	2911000	Pokemon to team up with
2911000	2913000	Read that first phrase again in that quote
2913000	2915000	Real quick. In that voice or normally?
2915000	2917000	Whatever you want
2917000	2919000	Pokemon fans are always interested
2919000	2921000	In playing in new environments
2921000	2923000	And experiencing new adventures
2923000	2925000	Okay okay you know what that translates to?
2925000	2927000	Pokemon fans will open up their wallets
2927000	2929000	And give us all their- They will buy fucking everything
2929000	2931000	They will buy any fucking thing that we put
2931000	2933000	In front of them and they will like it
2933000	2935000	If this was something that we were
2935000	2937000	That we were you know head over heels
2937000	2939000	Interested in we have a quote
2939000	2941000	For this too
2941000	2943000	Shut up and take my money!
2943000	2945000	Exactly. As I screw up the quote the first time
2945000	2947000	I got it
2949000	2951000	But I know people like that
2951000	2953000	Shane's like that
2953000	2955000	He probably has his pre-order in already
2957000	2959000	Not that there's anything wrong with that
2959000	2961000	Alright let's go on to the next story
2961000	2963000	Was that mine? I'm keeping up
2963000	2965000	I swear. My computer isn't though
2965000	2967000	Um
2967000	2969000	Max Payne is being brought out
2969000	2971000	Again and being adapted to
2971000	2973000	IOS was this one
2973000	2975000	I think this one uh yeah an Android
2975000	2977000	Version is actually gonna come a couple of weeks later
2977000	2979000	The current rumor says that
2979000	2981000	Max Payne for IOS is going to
2981000	2983000	Come out on April 12th I believe that
2983000	2985000	Is Wednesday of this coming week
2985000	2987000	As to
2987000	2989000	Be expected it's gonna- The game is gonna be
2989000	2991000	Scaled down and adapted so that you can get your
2991000	2993000	Bullet time portable on
2993000	2995000	Purely on screen controls no talk
2995000	2997000	About any kind of a controller or anything to do
2997000	2999000	That but you can start diving around
2999000	3001000	And rolling around and uh
3001000	3003000	Falling off the- Oh what was that
3003000	3005000	Scene where you were going in like a drug
3005000	3007000	Crazed and you had that terrible
3007000	3009000	Walkway to navigate against that's gonna be
3009000	3011000	Really really bad with touch controls
3011000	3013000	Most ports are really really bad
3013000	3015000	With touch controls that's what
3015000	3017000	Makes the story interesting because like
3017000	3019000	I- That was the other game
3019000	3021000	I didn't mention in my gaming week is that um
3021000	3023000	Midway read
3023000	3025000	For the 200th time
3025000	3027000	Re-released their whole classic arcade game machine
3027000	3029000	Uh, classic arcade game compilation
3029000	3031000	And I picked it up in all the packs
3031000	3033000	So I have um
3033000	3035000	YARV, Gauntlet, um
3035000	3037000	The sequel to Smash TV, same characters
3037000	3039000	Uh, I completely
3039000	3041000	Forgot what it was called but then most specifically
3041000	3043000	Like my favorite game- Total carnage!
3043000	3045000	Thank you. My favorite game with a
3045000	3047000	Mouthful of popcorn again
3047000	3049000	Total popcorn!
3049000	3051000	Like I- Like I was
3051000	3053000	Just saying one of my favorite classic games in the arcade
3053000	3055000	Was All Points Bulletin and that is
3055000	3057000	In this collection but it uses
3057000	3059000	It uses the accelerometer
3059000	3061000	Or the dryer or one of the two and it uses
3061000	3063000	You have to tilt the phone to steer
3063000	3065000	And that-
3065000	3067000	That sucks! It's like
3067000	3069000	I would have been less torn up if there
3069000	3071000	Was an optional D-pad but the fact
3071000	3073000	That it's purely tilt is just a pain in the ass
3073000	3075000	Yeah that's the- I think I have that same one
3075000	3077000	It's the like Williams collection or something it's called
3077000	3079000	I thought it was Midway specifically
3079000	3081000	It's only on my iPad it's over in the other room
3081000	3083000	I have it it's called
3083000	3085000	Midway Arcade it looks just like that right?
3085000	3087000	Okay I have it too and Spy Hunter
3087000	3089000	Speaking of that game is in the- Playing that on the train too
3089000	3091000	And it fucking sucks
3091000	3093000	Yep
3093000	3095000	Like that's not how I want to play the game Hey look there's the fork in the road
3095000	3097000	Let me get off to the left. No why are you going to the right?
3097000	3099000	No, no I said to
3099000	3101000	Crash! There are- Okay there are
3101000	3103000	Two games that are actually
3103000	3105000	Three games that are tolerable in that collection
3105000	3107000	One of them is Joust
3107000	3109000	Because think about it
3109000	3111000	In Joust you didn't have up or down
3111000	3113000	You had left, right, and flap
3113000	3115000	So that works okay because
3115000	3117000	There's only so many buttons you can- You're not going to like
3117000	3119000	Accidentally screw up and hit up left when you meant to hit
3119000	3121000	Just left because you have a fat thumb
3121000	3123000	Or any of that right? There's left, right, and flap
3123000	3125000	So Joust works surprisingly alright
3125000	3127000	The other two are Ski Ball
3127000	3129000	And that- Basketball or- Dumb little
3129000	3131000	Basketball game
3131000	3133000	Which aren't even fucking Midway games they're just
3133000	3135000	But you still get tickets from them
3135000	3137000	Exactly! You can get the virtual
3137000	3139000	Prizes from the prize stand
3139000	3141000	You know what I've learned to do to get virtual tickets
3141000	3143000	Here's your players tip for Midway Arcade
3143000	3145000	Just fucking sit there and start Ski Ball
3145000	3147000	And go, just swipe your finger
3147000	3149000	Nine times really fast, restart
3149000	3151000	Nine times really fast, restart
3151000	3153000	I managed to get a 900 game within about
3153000	3155000	Five or six times of trying
3155000	3157000	There you go. So Max Payne this week
3157000	3159000	Android about a week and a half later
3159000	3161000	And everything else
3161000	3163000	Touch world is okay, moving on
3163000	3165000	Can I ask this real quick before we get into the
3165000	3167000	Next story? Ridgey you wanna say something?
3167000	3169000	No. Oh okay. Um
3169000	3171000	Did you hear the news around the internet this week
3171000	3173000	About how Instagram came out for Android?
3173000	3175000	Mhmm
3175000	3177000	And was suddenly bashed by
3177000	3179000	All the iPhone users everywhere that was like
3179000	3181000	Ugh
3181000	3183000	I can't believe Instagram is slumming
3183000	3185000	It up on Android
3185000	3187000	Hipstergram is now Losergram
3187000	3189000	Ugh
3189000	3191000	They need to come out with something new on the iPhone
3191000	3193000	Because I refuse to use an
3193000	3195000	App that exists on Android
3195000	3197000	What the fuck is up with that attitude?
3197000	3199000	Like I don't, where does that come from?
3199000	3201000	All the same holy wars that divide
3201000	3203000	Them in the first place. The same brainwashing
3203000	3205000	That has them upgrade a personal appliance
3205000	3207000	Every fucking nine months for $500
3207000	3209000	And they see nothing wrong with that
3209000	3211000	Same attitude. I'm gonna club
3211000	3213000	You with my iPhone if you keep talking
3213000	3215000	I'll help
3215000	3217000	But I'm not like that
3217000	3219000	I think everybody, I love it
3219000	3221000	When Android users get the same apps
3221000	3223000	Because sometimes we can still like play together
3223000	3225000	And stuff. I'm totally fine with
3225000	3227000	Android users having the apps
3227000	3229000	All my Android buddies have all the same
3229000	3231000	Words with friends hanging with friends
3231000	3233000	I'm sorry I haven't joined the
3233000	3235000	Zynga must die petition completely yet
3235000	3237000	I haven't started draw something
3237000	3239000	For that reason but I still play words with friends
3239000	3241000	Hanging with friends and scramble with friends
3241000	3243000	It's alright I'll just judge you from back here
3243000	3245000	Exactly. All the way across the table give that
3245000	3247000	Evil glare for the rest of the show
3247000	3249000	He still gives money to Zynga
3249000	3251000	I would ask Jason to host the show again
3251000	3253000	But he fucking plays Zynga games
3253000	3255000	Like he's so not cool
3255000	3257000	And then there are some other games we've
3257000	3259000	Played like there was, I can't even
3259000	3261000	Recall the name of it but there was some pool simulator
3261000	3263000	That had like 8 ball 9 ball and
3263000	3265000	Different table arrangements and that kind of stuff
3265000	3267000	And yeah those are all cross platform
3267000	3269000	And since they're asynchronous
3269000	3271000	And just alternating they work
3271000	3273000	Very well. They're very nice and they get everybody
3273000	3275000	Involved. Okay going to our chatroom at
3275000	3277000	Cat.orangeslaungeradio.com. Tigerclaw says
3277000	3279000	Sky it's Apple fanboys
3279000	3281000	They are elitists. No they're not
3281000	3283000	I'm an Apple
3283000	3285000	Fanboy and I'm the guy that buys
3285000	3287000	The iPhone every time. And your desktop is a
3287000	3289000	Windows machine
3289000	3291000	I'm by
3291000	3293000	I'm by
3293000	3295000	Alan I have to tell you something
3295000	3297000	I'm by. Computeral
3297000	3299000	By portable. And you have the sense to
3299000	3301000	Skip a release before you
3301000	3303000	Upgrade. Yeah alright
3303000	3305000	So dig yourself out of that hole
3305000	3307000	Although also recall
3307000	3309000	One of the first couple of words out of my mouth
3309000	3311000	After I walked in here last time
3311000	3313000	Wow I'm in Windows world. This feels
3313000	3315000	Weird. Okay then fanboy
3315000	3317000	Do you consider, you're worse than I am clearly
3317000	3319000	Do you consider yourself an elitist?
3321000	3323000	You have to think about this. I can't
3323000	3325000	I can talk like it. I don't mean it
3325000	3327000	I mean when I was
3327000	3329000	When I had my whole phone switching
3329000	3331000	debacle I actively looked at what Sprint
3331000	3333000	Had offerings for both Android and Windows
3333000	3335000	And because I had an iPad
3335000	3337000	I was more than willing to get a different
3337000	3339000	Phone because I still had something to let
3339000	3341000	Me get done with the tools that I wanted to use
3341000	3343000	But
3343000	3345000	Sprint's selection was fucking garbage
3345000	3347000	And they have the 4S so I was like okay I'm done
3347000	3349000	I figured it out
3349000	3351000	And that's the story of how I have the
3351000	3353000	Latest phone. There you go
3353000	3355000	Alright let's
3355000	3357000	Let's go. It's not the Apple
3357000	3359000	Show. Let's move on to this story. That's my
3359000	3361000	Other show that I do. Oh that's
3361000	3363000	Right. You really do have an Apple
3363000	3365000	Show. I do. I should let you guys plug your
3365000	3367000	Podcast because he has one too. I'll let you
3367000	3369000	Do that at the start of the next half of the
3369000	3371000	Show. Alright for now
3371000	3373000	Let's talk about the Wii U
3373000	3375000	And a rumor about the Wii U
3375000	3377000	And usually I don't like to talk about rumors
3377000	3379000	Like these but it was kind of a slow news week
3379000	3381000	Because everybody was in Boston with the PAX East
3381000	3383000	Thing. Which by the way we will have some phone calls
3383000	3385000	On that later. But for now
3385000	3387000	We better. Rumors. Yeah we better
3387000	3389000	Because I didn't go this year. I'm kind of sad
3389000	3391000	Some of the other all game shows had it
3391000	3393000	Covered but you know
3393000	3395000	I might go to West Coast
3395000	3397000	This year which is really exciting so
3397000	3399000	We'll hear from the folks
3399000	3401000	That were at PAX East a little later
3401000	3403000	For now let's talk about the Wii U
3403000	3405000	Launch date
3405000	3407000	Rumor spreading around the internet like wildfire
3407000	3409000	We're talking being picked up by Eurogamer
3409000	3411000	GameSpot and so on
3411000	3413000	The rumor is the Wii U
3413000	3415000	Is out November 18th
3415000	3417000	That day sounds awfully familiar
3417000	3419000	That's
3419000	3421000	Five years later isn't it?
3421000	3423000	Didn't the Wii U launch right around that day?
3423000	3425000	Did the Wii U launch? Or did the regular Wii U launch
3425000	3427000	November 18th? I don't remember
3427000	3429000	It was just before Thanksgiving
3429000	3431000	Because it was just before I moved out of Arizona
3431000	3433000	Apparently it's coming from
3433000	3435000	A Japanese retailer email
3435000	3437000	Or something like that is where this date is coming from
3437000	3439000	So you know take it or leave it
3439000	3441000	But November 18th is the day
3441000	3443000	So
3443000	3445000	Here's my honest reaction to that
3445000	3447000	I don't think Nintendo knows the day yet
3447000	3449000	I don't think Nintendo's picked the day yet
3449000	3451000	I think Nintendo in part is
3451000	3453000	Waiting to hear what Microsoft
3453000	3455000	And Sony are doing although I guess they have to
3455000	3457000	Release a date at E3
3457000	3459000	Maybe they don't have to
3459000	3461000	I want to say they didn't announce the Wii release date till after E3
3461000	3463000	That year
3463000	3465000	I don't even remember
3465000	3467000	The Wii
3467000	3469000	Came out on November
3469000	3471000	19th of 2006
3471000	3473000	Oh so close
3473000	3475000	Well okay at least that shows that
3475000	3477000	They're aiming for the same weekend essentially
3477000	3479000	So
3479000	3481000	I would not put it past a retailer
3481000	3483000	To stub a date based off
3483000	3485000	What they saw before
3485000	3487000	To have some record in their system
3487000	3489000	So they can start saying pre-order
3489000	3491000	Pre-order give us your money
3491000	3493000	Or at least some of it
3493000	3495000	So
3495000	3497000	Yep there you go
3497000	3499000	Another day Wii U
3499000	3501000	What else can you say?
3501000	3503000	Alright moving on
3503000	3505000	So there's been a lot
3505000	3507000	Of anger over
3507000	3509000	Street Fighter X Tekken that Capcom put out
3509000	3511000	A couple weeks ago
3511000	3513000	In regards to all of the
3513000	3515000	Launch day launch week DLC
3515000	3517000	Available
3517000	3519000	That is on the disc that you have to pay to
3519000	3521000	Unlock and I know if Loki were here
3521000	3523000	He would be pitching a fit right now
3523000	3525000	Because this is obviously a thorn in his side
3525000	3527000	There have been a lot of
3527000	3529000	Better business bureau complaints
3529000	3531000	About this and Capcom has finally released a statement
3531000	3533000	It's very
3533000	3535000	Professionally coded
3535000	3537000	And groomed
3537000	3539000	To say
3539000	3541000	We're sorry you feel that way
3541000	3543000	But
3543000	3545000	We didn't do anything wrong
3545000	3547000	Nanny nanny boo boo
3547000	3549000	The first draft of that said fuck you
3549000	3551000	You fucking fucks
3551000	3553000	But that got scrapped
3553000	3555000	Yeah they rubbed it through the PR machine
3555000	3557000	Some bubbles came out
3557000	3559000	Basically they're saying that
3559000	3561000	They make sure that the majority of
3561000	3563000	Content is on the disc
3563000	3565000	There's 38 fighters to play out of the box
3565000	3567000	It doesn't matter if the DLC is available
3567000	3569000	On the day after the release date
3569000	3571000	Or three weeks
3571000	3573000	You still have to pay whatever
3573000	3575000	Five, six bucks, PSN points
3575000	3577000	Xbox Live points
3577000	3579000	To access the content
3579000	3581000	So there's no difference between
3581000	3583000	Content that's on the disc that you have to pay to unlock
3583000	3585000	Versus stuff that's downloaded later
3585000	3587000	And they're saying
3587000	3589000	That the
3589000	3591000	Disc, the product of the game
3591000	3593000	When that has to go gold
3593000	3595000	When they actually say this game is done
3595000	3597000	And then the release date which comes a couple months later
3597000	3599000	Even if that
3599000	3601000	Extra content that comes later still makes it on the disc
3601000	3603000	It's
3603000	3605000	From their point of view
3605000	3607000	It was always
3607000	3609000	Intended to be something
3609000	3611000	Supplementary to the original product
3611000	3613000	And it's not wrong
3613000	3615000	Because Xbox and PSN lets them do this
3615000	3617000	And they're sorry but
3617000	3619000	You have to pay to unlock it either way
3619000	3621000	Whether it's day one or day 22
3621000	3623000	So
3623000	3625000	What do you think? You personally
3625000	3627000	You're a fighting game fan
3627000	3629000	I know that
3629000	3631000	Given what happened with Street Fighter 4
3631000	3633000	And Mortal Kombat
3633000	3635000	I basically learned to just say
3635000	3637000	Screw fighting games and wait until two years later
3637000	3639000	Which I know some people in chat are like
3639000	3641000	I don't know the name but
3641000	3643000	They're going to release a comprehensive
3643000	3645000	Game of the year full bullshitty DLC edition
3645000	3647000	I'd rather buy that
3647000	3649000	They have sworn they're not doing it this time
3649000	3651000	Unless you want to get the Vita version
3651000	3653000	Or whatever
3653000	3655000	Then sure, that's what Loki says
3655000	3657000	Get the Vita version
3657000	3659000	You have a Vita, we can get it
3659000	3661000	That was code for
3661000	3663000	Rob, buy it for your Vita
3663000	3665000	And let me play it
3665000	3667000	Let me play it when you're at work
3667000	3669000	I guess it's
3669000	3671000	It's sleazy but like they said
3671000	3673000	It's not wrong
3673000	3675000	You know, I'm playing Mass Effect 2
3675000	3677000	Which has a lot of
3677000	3679000	Several hour long DLC episode
3679000	3681000	Packs for it, missions with bonus weapons
3681000	3683000	And blah blah blah
3683000	3685000	But the game itself is already so long that you don't
3685000	3687000	You don't really need it
3687000	3689000	And it's just being a completionist and knowing that
3689000	3691000	I want to play Troll Mega Man so bad
3691000	3693000	But I don't have to but I want to
3693000	3695000	And it's on the disc
3695000	3697000	It's frustrating to know that
3697000	3699000	It's right there on the disc but they want you to pay
3699000	3701000	I mean that's the frustrating thing about it
3701000	3703000	At least the Mass Effect 2 stuff you actually download
3703000	3705000	And while there might be seeds of information
3705000	3707000	On the disc, you're still downloading
3707000	3709000	A good chunk of the dialogue and you know
3709000	3711000	All that you're actually downloading
3711000	3713000	You're not able to hack it off the disc
3713000	3715000	In my opinion
3715000	3717000	Capcom may think this is the more convenient
3717000	3719000	Way to do it or whatever but
3719000	3721000	The hacking community is kind of
3721000	3723000	Teaching them a lesson here
3723000	3725000	If you go that route
3725000	3727000	Here's the price you're going to pay for it
3727000	3729000	And it kind of sucks that legitimate users
3729000	3731000	Get screwed in the end
3731000	3733000	And that's where Capcom is starting to look like idiots
3733000	3735000	Like always
3735000	3737000	And on that note, there's actually related news reports
3737000	3739000	Coming out about this
3739000	3741000	About the fact that Capcom has posted
3741000	3743000	I believe it's on their own forums as well as also
3743000	3745000	The official Xbox Live boards
3745000	3747000	Is that they want people to enforce
3747000	3749000	To help enforce against the hackers
3749000	3751000	And report people who are using these
3751000	3753000	Hacked unlocked characters
3753000	3755000	And are using them on online matches
3757000	3759000	They can't do their own fucking job?
3759000	3763000	But if this is the more convenient way to do it
3763000	3765000	Then police it your goddamn self
3769000	3771000	I guess to save themselves a lot of wank
3771000	3773000	From their fans
3773000	3775000	Have it be available on launch day
3775000	3777000	Digitally
3777000	3779000	Do not put that shit on the disc
3779000	3781000	For any reason at all
3781000	3783000	And even if people want to make the argument that
3783000	3785000	Well, it's Tuesday morning and I have the disc
3785000	3787000	And now you're saying there's $40 worth of
3787000	3789000	DLC for me to get
3789000	3791000	Why wasn't it on the disc? They could just say
3791000	3793000	Well, because you have to download it
3793000	3795000	It's not on the disc
3795000	3797000	And that will remove a lot of the argument that the hackers have right now
3797000	3799000	AcidicVampire in our chat room says
3799000	3801000	Ultimately, it's their decision to make it pay to unlock
3801000	3803000	It sucks, but if you want to have it your way
3803000	3805000	You should wait until the final Ultimate Edition
3805000	3807000	Is eventually released
3807000	3809000	Yeah, exactly
3809000	3811000	The vote with your wallet statement
3811000	3813000	Which I think a lot of us are on board with
3813000	3815000	Yeah, I didn't buy it
3815000	3817000	And this is a big part of the reason I didn't buy it
3817000	3819000	Was because Capcom has historically shown
3819000	3821000	That even if they swear up and down
3821000	3823000	They're not going to do it this time
3823000	3825000	I don't believe them
3825000	3827000	I'm not going to buy it until there's the Ultimate Edition
3827000	3829000	Or I'm at least going to wait until the disc is down to like $20
3829000	3831000	Then I'll buy that
3831000	3833000	And then the $20 to unlock everything
3833000	3835000	That'll be about the game right there, right?
3835000	3837000	This story
3837000	3839000	The hackers, I guess, that have
3839000	3841000	Figured out how to play those
3841000	3843000	Pay to unlock characters online
3843000	3845000	Without having to actually
3845000	3847000	Get the DLC
3847000	3849000	Apparently Jill and Shumagoreth
3849000	3851000	From MVC3
3851000	3853000	Were on the disc launch day
3853000	3855000	As Pay to unlock characters
3855000	3857000	But they were incomplete assets
3857000	3859000	So to pull down that final 20%
3859000	3861000	That made them playable
3861000	3863000	That was a remote file package
3863000	3865000	That you could bring down to your console
3865000	3867000	Which is probably what they should have done here
3867000	3869000	I'm assuming
3869000	3871000	If they wanted to keep the hackers truly not playing it online
3871000	3873000	Or what have you
3873000	3875000	Let's see
3875000	3877000	Other comments in our chatroom at chat.orangenautry.com
3877000	3879000	Porkchop says
3879000	3881000	Capcom left characters on the disc
3881000	3883000	And the hackers saw it as a personal challenge
3883000	3885000	And they took it, they ran with it
3885000	3887000	And gee
3887000	3889000	What number of times is this that we've heard it?
3889000	3891000	Millionth and a half?
3891000	3893000	Absolutely, well you know the old saying
3893000	3895000	Hackers gonna hack
3895000	3897000	Right? Haters gonna hate and hackers
3897000	3899000	Gonna hack. So when you say
3899000	3901000	Your system is unhackable
3901000	3903000	That is like printing a wedding invitation
3903000	3905000	To all the hackers says you are cordially invited
3905000	3907000	To hack the fuck out of this box
3907000	3909000	Not only did they take the box, but they took the whole damn network
3909000	3911000	And almost the company
3911000	3913000	I mean, what set everybody off about
3913000	3915000	PlayStation when they removed Linux?
3915000	3917000	You wanna piss off a hacker?
3917000	3919000	Take their Linux away?
3919000	3921000	I mean for real
3921000	3923000	Take away their command line
3923000	3925000	Take away their way of exploring
3925000	3927000	And they'll make a new way
3927000	3929000	Brute or not
3929000	3931000	And for people that work in IT
3931000	3933000	That are hardcore crypto people
3933000	3935000	They don't even have to be gamers
3935000	3937000	They see this stuff as a Rubik's Cube
3937000	3939000	It's exactly like you said
3939000	3941000	It's a gauntlet thrown down, it's a challenge
3941000	3943000	Once they release into the crack community
3943000	3945000	Here's how you
3945000	3947000	Unlock this
3947000	3949000	They may not even be gamers, they're just really into crypto
3949000	3951000	And the community is there
3951000	3953000	And they're always gonna find a way around it
3953000	3955000	It is pretty surprising that they're
3955000	3957000	Not only hacking, but they're going activist
3957000	3959000	With it and actually playing these
3959000	3961000	And matches and using it as advertising
3961000	3963000	That's pretty ballsy
3963000	3965000	To go on Xbox Live with your gamer tag
3965000	3967000	And be all, look at me, bitch
3967000	3969000	I know a lot of people that have a lot of safeguards in place
3969000	3971000	That on a console that is hacked
3971000	3973000	Actively prevent them from going on
3973000	3975000	Xbox Live first
3975000	3977000	And nothing goes wrong
3977000	3979000	And then they have to knowingly unlock it
3979000	3981000	And undo any mods or however the process actually works
3981000	3983000	But yeah, this is
3983000	3985000	Probably attributable to the last six months
3985000	3987000	Or so of tech news
3987000	3989000	But they're not only hacking, they're going activist
3989000	3991000	On it as well
3991000	3993000	That's the more interesting story for me personally
3993000	3995000	Interesting
3995000	3997000	Because now people in our chat room are talking
3997000	3999000	About what is likely next
3999000	4001000	And Wylan says, I won't buy Darkstalkers 4
4001000	4003000	But Stan says, I'll totally
4003000	4005000	Buy Darkstalkers 4 even if there's stupid DLC
4005000	4007000	I've been waiting for that forever
4007000	4009000	Act F says, I'll buy Darkstalkers 4
4009000	4011000	When the Ultimate Edition comes out
4011000	4013000	This is interesting
4013000	4015000	Have the reputation of fighting games
4015000	4017000	Been tarnished due to not just the behavior
4017000	4019000	Of Capcom, but if you think about it, Mortal Kombat
4019000	4021000	And WB Games
4021000	4023000	Didn't really do anything different, granted they didn't leave it
4023000	4025000	On the disc, but they did release
4025000	4027000	Extra fighters just to turn around
4027000	4029000	This is February or March, they had the comprehensive
4029000	4031000	Freddy Krueger, Scarlet
4031000	4033000	You know, Kenji
4033000	4035000	DLC edition
4035000	4037000	So it's not just Capcom, if you think about it
4037000	4039000	I still stand by my argument
4039000	4041000	That EVO has something to do with the timing
4041000	4043000	And the extensive release
4043000	4045000	And all that kind of stuff
4045000	4047000	I really do feel that that factors in
4047000	4049000	Because fighting games have thankfully stepped back into the mainstream
4049000	4051000	And EVO, if there's something bigger than that
4051000	4053000	I don't know what it is
4053000	4055000	At least here in the States, of course
4055000	4057000	I don't have a specific point
4057000	4059000	That comes off that
4059000	4061000	Ties into all of this
4061000	4063000	Has Namco and Tekken and Soul Calibur
4063000	4065000	Done this shit? I don't think they have
4065000	4067000	They're still the one franchise that's relatively
4067000	4069000	Tarnished
4069000	4071000	Well, Soul Calibur
4071000	4073000	Well, if you had Yoda, you could pay to
4073000	4075000	Get Vader, and if you had Vader
4075000	4077000	Because of the version you bought, you could pay to unlock Yoda
4077000	4079000	But that was really it
4079000	4081000	It was one character, and everyone knew that was gonna happen
4081000	4083000	Well, you know what they're doing now
4083000	4085000	Is it's all the-
4085000	4087000	Yeah, because 5 just came out and I have no idea what they're doing with it
4087000	4089000	They're doing princess packs
4089000	4091000	If you want to dress up your pretty princess
4091000	4093000	In all the gear, you have to download the
4093000	4095000	Costume packs
4095000	4097000	But that's
4097000	4099000	That's still shitty
4099000	4101000	But it's cosmetic
4101000	4103000	Whereas in this, it's players, characters
4103000	4105000	Right, I mean, it's not
4105000	4107000	I think what they're doing is not
4107000	4109000	Nearly as bad as what's happening here
4109000	4111000	Over at Capcom
4111000	4113000	And if you're into the design character stuff
4113000	4115000	Which I know some of our listeners are
4115000	4117000	They sent a bunch of custom characters
4117000	4119000	He made, and a lot of them are just hilarious
4119000	4121000	Like, they're great
4121000	4123000	Real life interpretations made in the game
4123000	4125000	And with even more stuff
4125000	4127000	I can just imagine the additional
4127000	4129000	Opportunities that opens up
4129000	4131000	But that's totally different than
4131000	4133000	You know, a whole different character is here
4133000	4135000	On the disc, you know
4135000	4137000	But I don't think they really had
4137000	4139000	DLC characters, there might have been like
4139000	4141000	One that came with the collector's edition
4141000	4143000	I can't remember
4143000	4145000	The best buy, I want to say
4145000	4147000	The really over the top silly
4147000	4149000	Like vaudeville character
4149000	4151000	I would imagine that after a couple of months he would be made
4151000	4153000	Available for DLC, but there's a precedent
4153000	4155000	For that, that they did with Vader and Yoda
4155000	4157000	Right
4157000	4159000	Alright, let's move on
4159000	4161000	Let's talk about what games are coming out to a retailer
4161000	4163000	Near you that will require you to buy it in the store
4163000	4165000	And then buy all the DLC later
4165000	4167000	Okay, maybe not
4167000	4169000	What's coming out in the US, Jason?
4169000	4171000	Especially considering the selection that I have to work with
4171000	4173000	If these games have DLC that would scare
4173000	4175000	That would scare me to death
4175000	4177000	Pretty light week
4177000	4179000	As far as I see from the next week
4179000	4181000	Three games that
4181000	4183000	I don't know if I should even go on with them
4183000	4185000	But here they are
4185000	4187000	3DS, Spirit Camera, The Cursed Memoir
4187000	4189000	With bonus
4189000	4191000	Drops on the 13th
4191000	4193000	Oh, that's just a strategy guide
4193000	4195000	Why is that in a game?
4195000	4197000	You fail-tastic
4197000	4199000	Also for the Nintendo DS, Titanic Mystery
4199000	4201000	Maybe with DLC you can
4201000	4203000	Float the ship back up with ping pong balls
4203000	4205000	I solved the mystery
4205000	4207000	It sinks
4209000	4211000	It was Colonel Mustard in the ballroom
4211000	4213000	With the anchor
4213000	4215000	And lastly
4215000	4217000	With the iceberg
4223000	4225000	I don't even remember the blue character's name
4225000	4227000	So there's not even really a way to narrow that down anymore
4227000	4229000	Mrs. Peacock?
4229000	4231000	Yeah, that's not water related at all
4231000	4233000	Oh, okay
4233000	4235000	There was a tie in there somewhere, but I'm not witty enough
4235000	4237000	Speaking of boat sinking, I think that joke just sank
4237000	4239000	To the bottom of the Pacific
4239000	4241000	I'll never let go, Jack
4241000	4243000	I'll never let go
4243000	4245000	We were watching Titan AE last night
4245000	4249000	And the very ending had a very similar situation
4249000	4251000	I'll never let go
4251000	4253000	I'll never let go
4253000	4255000	I'll save you
4255000	4257000	At any rate
4257000	4259000	Lastly, oh, so Titanic Mystery
4259000	4261000	Is...
4261000	4263000	That's not next week, that's two days ago
4263000	4265000	Okay, I apologize, this just failed a lot
4265000	4267000	Spirit camera for the DS
4267000	4269000	Titanic Mystery for the DS
4269000	4271000	4-in-1 action pack for the PS3
4271000	4273000	Drops on Tuesday
4273000	4275000	Quiet week
4275000	4277000	An unexciting week
4277000	4279000	Well, let's go to Japan and see if it's any different over there
4279000	4281000	On the 12th in Japan
4281000	4283000	On the Nintendo 3DS
4283000	4285000	Nintendo Sudoku 3D
4285000	4287000	Dai Ni Shu
4287000	4289000	Eitsuno Puzzle Day 1000mon
4289000	4291000	That is, for real, the name of the game
4291000	4293000	It's fucking Sudoku in 3D
4293000	4295000	Okay
4295000	4297000	Like
4297000	4299000	Can somebody explain to me
4299000	4303000	How Sudoku is fucking enhanced in three dimensions?
4303000	4305000	Because you can have a cube instead of just a flat surface
4305000	4307000	No, it's not even that
4307000	4309000	Well, it could be a cube
4309000	4311000	Your brain couldn't fucking handle the Sudoku coob
4311000	4313000	I could do that
4313000	4315000	The Sudoku
4315000	4317000	Sudoku Coos? What?
4317000	4319000	Sudoku
4319000	4321000	Moving on to others
4321000	4323000	That's all that's on the 3DS this week
4323000	4325000	With a title that long
4325000	4327000	I thought it was Sudoku with schoolgirl titties
4327000	4329000	Or whatever Japanese has
4329000	4331000	That would have been far more interesting
4331000	4333000	I would play a Sudoku game if
4333000	4335000	After you beat the puzzle
4335000	4337000	Sexy lady dance, titties in 3D
4337000	4339000	Maybe that's the hidden feature
4339000	4341000	Or you know
4341000	4343000	Guys in their underwear
4343000	4345000	Shaking it in 3D
4345000	4347000	Whatever it is you're into
4347000	4349000	You could have a switch
4349000	4351000	I think you just alienated 80% of the listeners
4351000	4353000	Look, it's like Mass Effect
4353000	4355000	You get a choice
4355000	4357000	You can point the thing up or down
4361000	4363000	If you were worried about tonight being a dry night
4363000	4365000	Dry night
4369000	4371000	How about the Vita?
4371000	4373000	How about it? In Japan this week
4373000	4375000	Rayman Origins
4375000	4377000	And, and ready?
4377000	4379000	Nikolai no Sudoku 5
4379000	4381000	Shugyoku number 12
4381000	4383000	Puzzle, that's right
4383000	4385000	It's a Sudoku game on the Vita
4385000	4387000	As well
4387000	4389000	Is that a swastika? What is that?
4389000	4391000	That's one of the puzzles
4391000	4393000	No, that is not a swastika
4393000	4395000	That is not Sudoku
4395000	4397000	It's rotated
4397000	4399000	Look at it diagonally
4399000	4401000	I need the chat
4401000	4403000	Oh, it kind of does look like a swastika
4405000	4407000	Don't buy that game you guys
4407000	4409000	That's not cool
4409000	4411000	It's in chat, tell us we're wrong
4411000	4413000	That is not a Sudoku puzzle, that's the other one
4413000	4415000	What's that? Kakoru?
4415000	4417000	There's the missing number crossword
4417000	4419000	Kakoru or something like that
4419000	4421000	I don't remember the name of it, god dammit
4425000	4427000	How about on the consoles?
4427000	4429000	Maybe there's something to save us on the
4429000	4431000	Playstation 3 this week in Japan
4431000	4433000	Dirt 3
4433000	4435000	You get Sudoku or Dirt
4435000	4437000	Also
4437000	4439000	Grand Slam Tennis 2
4439000	4441000	And Rayman Origins
4441000	4443000	On the Playstation 3
4443000	4445000	And lastly on the Xbox 360
4445000	4447000	Nothing, because no one owns
4447000	4449000	a 360 in Japan
4449000	4451000	No seriously, there's nothing on the 360
4451000	4453000	this week in Japan
4453000	4455000	How about Europe? UK
4455000	4457000	All those countries over there
4457000	4459000	Looks like
4459000	4461000	a light week over on the UK side
4461000	4463000	or the Europe side as well
4463000	4465000	On the 11th I have Football
4465000	4467000	Manager handheld for the Android
4467000	4469000	Legend of
4469000	4471000	Grimrock for the PC
4471000	4473000	Skullgirls for
4473000	4475000	Playstation 3 and 360
4475000	4477000	On the 12th we have
4477000	4479000	Max Payne Mobile, which we just covered
4479000	4481000	Tribes Ascend for the PC
4481000	4483000	On the 13th
4483000	4485000	Fez
4485000	4487000	Fez, not Rez
4487000	4489000	Fez, maybe your little Shriners in the little cars
4489000	4491000	Fez for the 360
4491000	4493000	On the 14th, Pandora's
4493000	4495000	Tower for the Wii
4495000	4497000	Which is kind of
4497000	4499000	a big deal
4499000	4501000	That's one of those Operation Rainfall games
4501000	4503000	Pandora's Tower?
4503000	4505000	So while we wait here in the US
4505000	4507000	everybody's going to be pirating it
4507000	4509000	Because that's what
4509000	4511000	people do
4511000	4513000	Alright, I'm just kidding kids, don't pirate
4513000	4515000	But seriously
4515000	4517000	Someone on my Facebook just mentioned getting
4517000	4519000	Center Blade Chronicles
4519000	4521000	Like they just bought it in the store this week
4521000	4523000	And I was like, what? Oh yeah
4523000	4525000	I guess we should only really be playing that
4525000	4527000	Starting this week
4527000	4529000	Oops
4529000	4531000	I would have loved to have bought Xenoblade
4531000	4533000	A year ago
4533000	4535000	Nintendo, you've made the bed
4535000	4537000	Now lie in it
4537000	4539000	Moving on, let's do one other
4539000	4541000	Quick story before we get to the classic game of the week
4541000	4543000	DarkSakura's not here tonight
4543000	4545000	I know she's in the chat and she can scream all she wants
4545000	4547000	But we're taking the
4547000	4549000	Classic game of the week car and driving it
4549000	4551000	In another direction tonight, so here we go
4551000	4553000	Jason, one more story though
4553000	4555000	By the way, the chat room
4555000	4557000	Oh there was, hey, look at the main intention
4557000	4559000	Well I'll say this real quick, the chat room is
4559000	4561000	Lighting up, saying there is
4561000	4563000	What we know as a swastika
4563000	4565000	In Japanese can be a manji
4565000	4567000	Which is actually a good luck
4567000	4569000	And some old video games had that
4569000	4571000	For instance there was some
4571000	4573000	Dungeons and Zelda, somebody was saying in our chat room
4573000	4575000	Kind of looked like that
4575000	4577000	I remember it was 1942 and 1943
4577000	4579000	Had those symbols
4579000	4581000	In the Japanese versions
4581000	4583000	And they were like extra life or something
4583000	4585000	So, and it's not controversial there
4585000	4587000	Because it has a different meaning
4587000	4589000	It looks mirrored to me
4589000	4591000	Yes, I believe it's the other direction
4591000	4593000	But obviously that's a pretty easy mistake
4593000	4595000	For commoners, so generally
4595000	4597000	Games that would have had it and come to America
4597000	4599000	Get it just changed to something else entirely
4599000	4601000	Or just stripped out
4601000	4603000	Was there another comment on that one?
4603000	4605000	No
4605000	4607000	Yes, one last story because I swear I am keeping up with things
4607000	4611000	New York has booted all of its registered sex offenders
4611000	4613000	Off online gaming networks
4613000	4615000	Microsoft, Sony, Blizzard, EA, and Apple
4615000	4617000	All cooperated with the purge
4617000	4619000	Which follows a court case
4619000	4621000	In the state of New York
4621000	4623000	In which a 19 year old pleaded guilty
4623000	4625000	To abusing a 10 year old
4625000	4627000	He met on Xbox Live
4627000	4629000	New York law demands all convicted sex offenders
4629000	4631000	To hand over any email addresses
4631000	4633000	And online aliases
4633000	4635000	To help limit their access on vulnerable web networks
4635000	4637000	However, this is the first time it's ever been invoked
4637000	4639000	In relation to online gaming
4639000	4641000	Pretty, pretty
4641000	4643000	Didn't, we
4643000	4645000	We never went through this
4645000	4647000	Six years ago with Uno
4647000	4649000	And yet we're finally here
4649000	4651000	Oh god, strip Uno, I remember that story
4651000	4653000	Look, here's the thing though
4653000	4655000	Obviously
4655000	4657000	People that would do that stuff to kids
4657000	4659000	Are not okay and they need to be dealt with
4659000	4661000	In ways like this, I get that
4661000	4663000	But, there's another side to this
4663000	4665000	That kind of bothers me
4665000	4667000	What parent was letting their 10 year old
4667000	4669000	Play on Xbox Live unsupervised?
4669000	4671000	Hello
4671000	4673000	Did they just not know
4673000	4675000	What happens on Xbox Live?
4675000	4677000	I'm like, ignorance is not an excuse
4677000	4679000	You know what I mean?
4679000	4681000	That should be a wake up call
4681000	4683000	To parents everywhere
4683000	4685000	You need to supervise children
4685000	4687000	That are going to play games online like that
4687000	4689000	Again, I'm not saying
4689000	4691000	What the 19 year old
4691000	4693000	19 year old did was right
4693000	4695000	That's no excuse, but I'm just saying
4695000	4697000	There's kind of a couple things wrong in this picture
4697000	4699000	Although, take it on the flip side
4699000	4701000	And I can say something from my youth
4701000	4703000	While I wasn't 10 years old
4703000	4705000	I was still really young
4705000	4707000	And my parents were divorced
4707000	4709000	And I was living with my mom
4709000	4711000	And on the times that she had custody of me
4711000	4713000	And even sometimes when my dad
4713000	4715000	Had custody of us
4715000	4717000	Sometimes it was just myself
4717000	4719000	And my sister who is 3 years older than me
4719000	4721000	But sometimes it was just straight up me
4721000	4723000	Often times, especially after my
4723000	4725000	Sister grew up and moved out
4725000	4727000	It was just myself in the house
4727000	4729000	All weekend
4729000	4731000	This is before the years of online gaming
4731000	4733000	Functionally
4733000	4735000	This is just a modern version of that
4735000	4737000	But these situations
4737000	4739000	And I completely understand
4739000	4741000	Where you're coming from
4741000	4743000	One, there are bad parents
4743000	4745000	Two, there are bad situations with good parents
4745000	4747000	And
4747000	4749000	It would be
4749000	4751000	Great if parental controls
4751000	4753000	Were a lot more perfect
4753000	4755000	If Microsoft could step in a lot better
4755000	4757000	And have some kind of a camera
4757000	4759000	Filter or if they were just kind of smarter about it
4759000	4761000	But these situations happen
4761000	4763000	And it's incredibly unfortunate
4763000	4765000	I can kind of meet you halfway there because
4765000	4767000	When I was probably about 12 or 13
4767000	4769000	On my Commodore 64
4769000	4771000	On my 300 baud modem
4771000	4773000	I was calling into BBS's
4773000	4775000	Local bulletin board systems
4775000	4777000	And posting on message boards and playing door games
4777000	4779000	I was fucking playing Legend of the Red Dragon and shit
4779000	4781000	At like 14 and 15 right
4781000	4783000	Which if you ever played those games back in the day
4783000	4785000	Nice games
4785000	4787000	And my mom just said oh he's on the computer
4787000	4789000	You know and I was posting on message boards and stuff
4789000	4791000	And there would be people on the message boards
4791000	4793000	It's like yeah you should like come out to this meetup
4793000	4795000	And all this stuff and it's like okay I'm 15
4795000	4797000	You know and
4797000	4799000	You know I can kind of see
4799000	4801000	That side of it
4801000	4803000	That sometimes the parents
4803000	4805000	If she knew what I was doing online though
4805000	4807000	She would have punched me in the face
4807000	4809000	She would have taken the cord
4809000	4811000	She would have burned the cord in front of my eyes
4811000	4813000	She knew what kind of stuff
4813000	4815000	I was doing on the computer
4815000	4817000	How does the outside world exist anymore?
4817000	4819000	Especially nowadays
4819000	4821000	With us I mean look at what we're doing here
4821000	4823000	Three nerds around the table and a lot of cords
4823000	4825000	That are just connecting us to the rest of everybody else
4825000	4827000	Did you have a comment on this Alan?
4827000	4829000	I feel that
4829000	4831000	A lot of people
4831000	4833000	Will pretend to be high and mighty by saying that
4833000	4835000	A TV or a console should not be a babysitter
4835000	4837000	But it's
4837000	4839000	A privilege for a kid to have
4839000	4841000	Two adults that are in the same household
4841000	4843000	As them invested in raising them
4843000	4845000	And sometimes if they have to work
4845000	4847000	Full time jobs you know
4847000	4849000	To do what's necessary to run that household
4849000	4851000	A console or a TV will be a babysitter
4851000	4853000	For four or five hours a day
4853000	4855000	And I don't really think that that's negligent to do so
4855000	4857000	And even if the parents
4857000	4859000	Had taken measures to lock down that kind of stuff
4859000	4861000	It doesn't necessarily mean the 10 year old
4861000	4863000	Doesn't know how to crack their parents
4863000	4865000	Password and lock it themselves
4865000	4867000	Like they're not
4867000	4869000	Idiots at 10
4869000	4871000	I guess that's true you know but
4871000	4873000	Don't fucking buy them an Xbox Live subscription
4875000	4877000	Do not buy a 10 year old an Xbox Live subscription
4877000	4879000	Ever
4879000	4881000	And if you're gonna get one for yourself
4881000	4883000	Password lock it if you know there's a kid in the house
4883000	4885000	It's dangerous
4885000	4887000	Yeah and if the kid still cracks the password
4887000	4889000	There shouldn't be icky
4889000	4891000	20 plus, 30 plus year old pedos
4891000	4893000	Creeping on them
4893000	4895000	Well that's still absolutely true and I'm still
4895000	4897000	But I'm just saying you know
4897000	4899000	Everybody needs to accept some responsibility here
4899000	4901000	Alright
4901000	4903000	Anyhow let's move on
4903000	4905000	Let's move on to a time when
4905000	4907000	Xbox Live didn't exist and we didn't have these
4907000	4909000	Complicated situations
4909000	4911000	Although the Nintendo
4911000	4913000	Did still babysit us a little bit
4913000	4915000	Or in the case of this week's Classic Game of the Week
4915000	4917000	An old computer would babysit
4917000	4919000	Okay so here's the deal Dark Soccer's not here tonight
4919000	4921000	So this is Dark Soccer's Classic Game of the Week
4921000	4923000	But we're taking over
4923000	4925000	It's my Classic Game of the Week tonight
4925000	4927000	Dark Soccer had picked a game for tonight
4927000	4929000	But I was like, it's a good game, but I'm like
4929000	4931000	She can, I wouldn't want to
4931000	4933000	I wouldn't want to do it without her here
4933000	4935000	Because then she might have things she wants to say about that game
4935000	4937000	So we'll let her roll it over to next week
4937000	4939000	And I'm gonna do a game tonight
4939000	4941000	That I know she would never pick
4941000	4943000	Why? Because I picked a game
4943000	4945000	From the Commodore 64
4945000	4947000	That's right, the game I've picked tonight
4947000	4949000	Is tonight's Classic Game of the Week is
4949000	4951000	Impossible Mission
4951000	4953000	I don't know if anybody ever remembers this game
4953000	4955000	But this game was awesome
4955000	4957000	Because it was one of the first games ever
4957000	4959000	To use a voice synthesizer
4959000	4961000	And so here you go
4961000	4963000	Here's what you would hear when you would start
4963000	4965000	Impossible Mission
4965000	4967000	Another visitor
4967000	4969000	Stay a while
4969000	4971000	Stay forever
4971000	4973000	That was the shit
4973000	4975000	When I was a kid
4975000	4977000	By the way, he's saying another visitor
4977000	4979000	Another visitor
4979000	4981000	Stay forever
4981000	4983000	The last Metroid
4983000	4985000	Is in captivity
4985000	4987000	The galaxy is at peace
4987000	4989000	It was kind of like that
4989000	4991000	So the original version was on the Commodore 64
4991000	4993000	And it was done by Epyx in 1984
4993000	4995000	Epyx was the company that made this game
4995000	4997000	Can we even hear the thing?
4997000	4999000	By the way, the sound effects
4999000	5001000	And stuff in this game is very
5001000	5003000	Ambient
5003000	5005000	There's no music
5005000	5007000	So you just have some very ambient noises
5007000	5009000	If you want to jump a little bit there
5009000	5011000	Alright, so anyway, here is the deal
5011000	5013000	In Impossible Mission
5013000	5015000	Not to be confused with Mission Impossible
5015000	5017000	Wink Wink Nudge Nudge
5017000	5019000	The big show from the 60s
5019000	5021000	Impossible Mission, you played a secret agent
5021000	5023000	Not to be confused with 007
5023000	5025000	That is trying to stop an evil genius
5025000	5027000	Elvin Atombender
5027000	5029000	Is tampering with
5029000	5031000	National security computers
5031000	5033000	So you go into the stronghold
5033000	5035000	And you race against the clock
5035000	5037000	Which in turn will make a password
5037000	5039000	While you avoid deadly
5039000	5041000	Electrocuting face eating robots
5041000	5043000	Ok, they don't eat your face
5043000	5045000	But they will electrocute you
5045000	5047000	And you will sometimes fall
5047000	5049000	Down bottomless pits and all you'll hear is
5049000	5051000	Ahhhh
5053000	5055000	Anyhow
5055000	5057000	We've got the chorus going on now
5057000	5059000	Once you finally put the password pieces together
5059000	5061000	You'll put the completed password in the main
5061000	5063000	Control room door, and that's where you
5063000	5067800	find the evil professor. Where do you find password pieces? In the furniture of
5067800	5071480	course. You search the furniture in the rooms you might find lift resets and
5071480	5075640	snoozes in the rooms as well. You also will have a room where you can get more
5075640	5080100	lift resets and snoozes from doing a musical puzzle. There you go.
5080100	5083840	Everything in this game was randomized which kind of made this a lot of fun
5083840	5089200	because you could play it over and over again. Sometimes you would have layouts
5089200	5094520	of the mansion or the stronghold that like were not winnable. But most of the
5094520	5099920	time you got winnable and sometimes you get really easy one too. Rogue apparently
5099920	5103600	was an early inspiration for the randomized room layouts. The designer
5103600	5107480	cited rogue. Do you remember the old old ass rogue game that was on like
5107480	5111200	terminals? I don't know that I've originally I've played an original rogue but I've played a
5111200	5115680	million roguelikes. Oh yeah well then you kind of know what the deal is there.
5115680	5121800	Here is the speech that is in the game. There is the death scream which can also
5121800	5127800	be heard in Beachhead 2. They recycled the death scream. There's another visitor
5127800	5134900	stay a while stay forever and then there's also destroy him my robots. Which
5134900	5138800	happens in the very first room you walk into a never again correct? It's a
5138800	5143640	randomized room. Really? And then there's also when the game is over there's a
5143640	5150640	laugh and then if you find him he'll say no no no and then there's a lady voice
5150640	5154120	that says mission accomplished congratulations and that's all the
5154120	5157280	speech in the game that's all you can fit on one of those freaking five and a
5157280	5161760	quarter floppy disks that is like bigger than terabyte hard drives these days.
5161760	5165480	There were only two types of enemies and impossible missions there were the laser
5165480	5171240	spout and robots and then there was also some some would move slow some would
5171240	5176200	move fast and then there's also other types of security guards that would kind
5176200	5180000	of just stay in place and then it would wake up when you got really close to it
5180000	5185200	there. You get six hours to beat the game 36 puzzle pieces every time you die
5185200	5192760	ten minutes are deducted from the total time. This game was ported like mad. It
5192760	5199200	was on the Apple 2, the Atari 7800, the ZX Spectrum, the Acorn Electron, the BBC
5199200	5204760	Micro, the Amstrad CPC, the NES, and the Sega Master System. Not all of them had
5204760	5211840	speech though. Get this the 7800 version on the NTSC platforms had a bug that
5211840	5216640	made the game impossible to win. So it really was impossible mission somebody
5216640	5220760	took the game name to literally there. Looks like level 30 syndrome started a
5220760	5225480	bit earlier than we thought. Aha there was a sequel called impossible mission
5225480	5231960	2 in 1988 with new traps and items and also a bigger stronghold. There was a 3d
5231960	5237000	sequel planned for Epyx's handy system. I don't know if you guys know but Epyx was
5237000	5241960	going to launch their own system. It eventually became the Atari Lynx so that
5241960	5248840	didn't happen. Impossible mission 2025 came out in 1994 for the Amiga which was
5248840	5254040	kind of the similar gameplay. Impossible mission did show up later in 2004 it was
5254040	5258240	on the Commodore 64 direct-to-tv and it was on the Nintendo Game Boy Advance in
5258240	5265480	2004 and the Sony PSP in 2008. Get that. This game is also available on the Wii
5265480	5269680	Virtual Console but only in Europe because the Commodore 64 was a fucking
5269680	5274320	huge deal in Europe. It was kind of big here but it was huge in Europe April 11
5274320	5279200	2008 is when it came out there. This is one of those games that this is the game
5279200	5283760	in my opinion and I'm obviously very age biased myself in that it's gotten better
5283760	5288280	with time because when I was young playing on a Commodore 64 I was just
5288280	5292000	like running jumping and collecting these random numbers and other things.
5292000	5295080	You had no idea what the fuck you were doing right? I can ride lifts up and down
5295080	5299120	inside the side and sometimes not even that couldn't always figure it out but
5299120	5303680	now that I've grown up and matured I actually understand what's going on and
5303680	5308080	what I have to do and this game is freaking hard but it's a good challenge
5308080	5311400	and it's worth revisiting and finally starting to finally starting to get
5311400	5316200	played again. I have actually I still have not beaten the game to this day but
5316200	5320560	knowing what I have to do going back and doing it with the original Commodore 64
5320560	5325680	version under emulation I've been making an active an active try to do it and
5325680	5329360	come up short so far but I've still had a lot of fun doing it.
5329360	5332680	Tigercall on our chat room says Sky do you think Impossible Mission could ever
5332680	5337080	get remade? Well I mean I mean we do have the Game Boy and the PSP ones but yeah
5337080	5341320	that the Wii the Wii version and all those modern consoles I I would call it
5341320	5347080	a remake because it's not it's not just like improved graphics a lot of a lot of
5347080	5352200	aspects of the game changed like you don't pick up numbers you pick up puzzle
5352200	5357160	pieces that you have to rotate and put into place that form like a map security
5357160	5360640	code something or other I got pissed off at the game and I stopped playing it
5360640	5364960	it's technically already happened but not in a significant way. I think there
5364960	5368880	would be a brilliant use on like let's say Xbox Live Arcade or PlayStation
5368880	5372240	Network of multiplayer can you imagine if you and three other people all
5372240	5376040	attacked the same Citadel at the same time and like you could maybe see the
5376040	5379560	shadows of the other players as they're exploring and then you know I think
5379560	5382720	this would be a great competitive game especially with the randomization
5382720	5385940	element in it and everything I think for like old-school fans I think there's
5385940	5390120	really something untapped here that the developers didn't do when they made
5390120	5394800	these other ports. For some very obvious reasons perhaps. You should be giving me
5394800	5398360	the rights to do this franchise even though I know nothing about game or
5398360	5402000	programming games I think that wouldn't that be a fantastic game on Xbox Live
5402000	5406000	you could like do multiplayer co-op and competitive you do co-op where you're
5406000	5410380	both collecting puzzle pieces I think this is a great franchise. One person
5410380	5413640	manning the computer and controlling some room elements and the other person
5413640	5417880	swiftly dodging the robots at a moment's notice and scanning scanning the
5417880	5421320	furniture and everything else a lot of potential absolutely. Well there it is
5421320	5425080	your classic game of the week for the Commodore 64 where it all started
5425080	5429160	although it's available in a shitload of systems after that impossible mission
5429160	5431760	Commodore 64 your classic game of the week
5431760	5438960	haha Dark Sakura haha took your other classic game and just threw it out the
5438960	5442440	window now she'll bring it back next week I know she will it's okay
5442440	5447640	considering what the game is it would just float to safety there's your hint
5447640	5451680	for next week all right that's gonna do it for part A of Orange Lounge Radio but
5451680	5453960	don't go anywhere we got plenty more to come in the second half of the show

5459120	5462680	the OLR listeners that was there I'm not ignoring PAX East I just I live in

5497680	5501600	tonight we have Alan of course and Jason filling in that's me I promised you guys
5501600	5504560	could talk about some of your side projects because you guys don't just
5504560	5508800	co-host here but you both now have your own regular podcast that you do Jason
5508800	5511840	we'll start with you you mentioned you do an Apple related thing yeah there's a
5511840	5517760	there's a network of nerd topic goodness called a stack exchange and myself I'm
5517760	5522320	quite personally vested with a couple of others on their Apple topic site called
5522320	5526200	ask different and so myself and two others started up the ask different
5526200	5531200	podcast and we've been going since I want to say last summer but suddenly
5531200	5534640	that feels wrong for some reason but ask different podcast pretty easy to search
5534640	5540920	for ask different comm is the site and there's links to blog chat finding us
5540920	5545240	finding the site itself and all that content pretty simple I'm assuming
5545240	5548640	that's a little pun on the think different yeah and that that's that was
5548640	5552960	that was the name chosen for the site the highest voted name for to actually
5552960	5557560	to actually call this site there there's like I could rant for like 30 minutes on
5557560	5560720	how we came to that name but I'll spare all you guys because it's not the topic
5560720	5563200	and you really do have a great radio voice I'm not just saying that cuz you're
5563200	5566800	here but I mean it's convenient but you do have a great real voice I can only
5566800	5572120	imagine it's the ass different podcast is great so all right not as a exciting
5572120	5576480	and hilarious as the show is at least 99% of the time sometimes we get in a
5576480	5580120	good good pun that's okay this show can be pretty boring too now I'm kidding it
5580120	5585600	shows always amazing always Alan you you now in the time that you have been for
5585600	5588920	your last guest co-hosting on this program you now have your own podcast
5588920	5593560	right I've branched out of the olr network how very dare I how very dare
5593560	5597880	you I'm surprised I'm surprised you were banned from this program actually I just
5597880	5603080	sleep on the couch for a week so pretend you didn't make me do that I am on a
5603080	5608920	podcast called fabulous flames and it is a World of Warcraft podcast maybe I
5608920	5615920	guess a competitor of courthouse yeah I know it's my hair yeah I was invited to
5615920	5620000	be on it because the host was a fan of what I had to say on whorehouse so
5620000	5624600	there's three of us and it's just I guess World of Warcraft from a male
5624600	5628440	point of view I don't really know what the gimmick is but yeah we it's a gay
5628440	5633760	Wow podcast that's what the gimmick is fabulous flames is an actual spell from
5633760	5639360	an encounter from this latest expansion and it's the gay dragon that was
5639360	5644200	originally supposed to sound like Paul in from match game and Blizzard like cut
5644200	5647440	his voice our listeners are listeners are too young to get that reference
5647440	5651280	honey so Blizzard cut his voice acting going no this is not good so we're
5651280	5656000	joking that we're the gay dragons and don't just stand in the flames bask in
5656000	5659160	them so it's it's World of Warcraft discussion and you can find us at
5659160	5664520	fabulous flames on Twitter and fabulous flames calm or on iTunes how very dare
5664520	5672560	you work that tagline so one gay dragons two talking dragons is my lack of Wow
5672560	5676640	biting me somewhere here it's the Twilight dragon twins it's a brother and
5676640	5682920	sister and the brother is on fire so I I've often been obviously I have a side
5682920	5686080	project I do not just orange on studio but I have a podcast about the World of
5686080	5689780	Warcraft called the best little whorehouse in Azeroth and our tagline is
5689780	5694880	it's all things World of Warcraft but never too seriously so you know that's
5694880	5699880	what we've got and I often get asked the question is it weird that you and your
5699880	5705880	boyfriend are on competing podcasts and I'm like no because I support all
5705880	5709680	independent podcasts and that's what I've been preaching on orange launch
5709680	5714360	radio for years so I fucking love it that he's doing his own show it's great
5714360	5721080	I love it no it is it is fabulous flames is still very much on its sea legs we're
5721080	5725320	only on our fourth or fifth episode so we have we have a long way to grow
5725320	5731240	you're still basic bitches but you'll grow I've been I am so rude to the the
5731240	5735200	main host of their sunshine I'm I am such a bitch to him on Twitter but it's
5735200	5739080	fun because you know we're frenemies we're frenemy podcasts is what we call
5739080	5743840	each other and so I've said I I have all these names for fabulous wives I call
5743840	5750480	them the fabulous flops it's my favorite name them so anyhow alright so there you
5750480	5755760	go and honestly I really do I think it's great because it's not like most people
5755760	5759000	I know that listen to podcasts listen at work and they've got plenty of time to
5759000	5762420	listen to plenty of shows and I would rather somebody be listening to an
5762420	5767320	independent podcast then some of that crap that certain websites that won't be
5767320	5774840	named produce honey yeah you try I had to dig in one more come on come on
5774840	5779640	alright anyhow so there you go let's um also I would do shoutouts for PAX East
5779640	5784200	since we're giving other shows shoutouts I do want to say I heard little bits and
5784200	5786840	pieces of what the B team which is one of the other shows on the all games
5786840	5792360	network did they were live at PAX East and did some good shows so check that
5792360	5797000	out I also know electric sistahood which is also on the all games network did a
5797000	5802120	show while they were there I don't think it was live but I think maybe it was I
5802120	5806960	don't remember sorry girls but they did one and it will be on their podcast feed
5806960	5810400	and on the network this week for sure and I think I heard Ranma who calls in
5810400	5814000	this show all the time and we'll be on the show tonight guest it on it so I'm
5814000	5817720	glad to see the all games network big happy family getting together at PAX I
5817720	5822040	will say the one year we did the all games thing at PAX Prime was a great
5822040	5825820	year I mean oh man that was a that was like one of my favorite cons ever was
5825820	5829840	that PAX Prime 2008 when all the all games people were there we were
5829840	5833880	broadcasting it was a great year but I did go to PAX East the first year a
5833880	5837200	couple years ago and had a good time so I was sad I couldn't go this year but
5837200	5841640	you know there's only so much money and you know I I spent a lot of it going to
5841640	5846200	Disneyland what can you do but I am gonna try and go to a PAX Prime this
5846200	5851120	year if nothing else all right I'll advertise real far advertising the all
5851120	5857600	games network never saw that coming well what do you want me to advertise I have
5857600	5862060	no good response tonight I was gonna say something bitchy about one of the
5862060	5865720	corporate networks but I'm not gonna go there and I'm just gonna ask that we go
5865720	5871400	for some rapid-fire news so you know what's funny about that I'm on a loaner
5871400	5875640	laptop right now and I just pulled the power cord out so I can tell you the
5875640	5880120	first story purely from recollection is that Diablo 3 was finally dated for mid
5880120	5883400	May what's the next quest what's the next question for the great dungeon
5883400	5888880	crawl torchlight when is it they haven't said yet soon soon shortly after Diablo
5888880	5893560	3 which is still soon but not soon enough you want to give me the headlines
5893560	5901080	of the next two because I can hard angle oh what there you go
5901080	5907040	theater rhythm Final Fantasy finally dated for the what is that midsummer
5907040	5911440	July 3rd mm-hmm game was actually completely off my radar but looking at
5911440	5915680	the looking at the screenshots looks fun I did get a particular amount of
5915680	5919240	amusement of the fact that cloud stripes face was completely obscured in the one
5919240	5923520	screenshot I did see by the target exceeding the the the note exceeding the
5923520	5928800	target zone whatever the particular vocabulary is for that and finally Sega
5928800	5932680	says rhythm thief is still happening and that article unfortunately I don't have
5932680	5936080	on the top of my head so while my computer starts back up can somebody
5936080	5941800	saved my poor dead-air ass there was they were on the paxi Sega was at PAX
5941800	5945920	East and there was confirmation that rhythm thief is still happening this is
5945920	5949320	despite all the Sega bad news we had last week
5949320	5954000	rhythm thief was not canceled so it is still happening it's a 3ds rhythm action
5954000	5959040	game featuring people in top hats and ties I guess they're like tap dancing on
5959040	5962720	disco floors there you go all right some other rapid-fire news for you guys
5962720	5967160	fallout the original not the fallout 3 which was still really good but the
5967160	5971640	original original game way back in the day was free I say was because you
5971640	5976960	missed it it was on good old games or gog.com it was earlier this week
5976960	5980200	unfortunately if you're hearing this now though it is no longer free so why am I
5980200	5984320	reporting it because I just wanted you to know what you missed out on free
5984320	5987920	fallout which is a great great PC get your PC gaming fan I know you know yes
5987920	5993200	all serious also it's worth mentioning since we brought up gog they throw a
5993200	5996840	little shade at steam this week they were kind of like you know when you give
5996840	6000560	these games away for such low cost it doesn't really help anyone which I
6000560	6008000	thought was an interesting little dig it helps me I can't imagine I mean EA
6008000	6012480	fucked off and did their origin store because they just want to be elitist and
6012480	6016600	only sell things through their own platform but if a game developer is
6016600	6024000	letting steam sell a five-year-old game for $2.99 I don't think valve is
6024000	6028680	twisting their arm zithers in our chat room talking about the Sega stuff saying
6028680	6032520	I hope to God we get Phantasy Star online to hear if that gets canned I
6032520	6037800	will explode I hear ya that character creator came out this week overseas it's
6037800	6041560	not you know that the game has been announced for the US cross your fingers
6041560	6043960	and your toes we get any three announcement because if you don't hear
6043960	6048800	it at e3 it's probably not happening you know what is happening though a sieve
6048800	6054040	5 expansion civilization 5 gods and kings it is going to be coming out on
6054040	6061160	June 19 is the release date for that 22nd if you're international there was
6061160	6063880	more information announced about this a game developers conference but in case
6063880	6069960	you forgot 27 new units 13 new buildings 9 new wonders and civilization they're
6069960	6073840	also going to add religion and espionage into the game and some tweaks to
6073840	6078000	diplomacy so hopefully they'll fix some of the balancing issues that they borked
6078000	6082600	in the game to begin with but if any of my sieve friends are listening we're
6082600	6085960	gonna need to get a match going in late June after this comes out because I'm
6085960	6090080	I'm eager to revisit the game again but God you know how the sieve 5 matches
6090080	6092960	will go you started at six o'clock in the evening and then suddenly oh shit
6092960	6101200	it's 2 a.m. and we just discovered railroads another story this week epic
6101200	6107520	games you know epic games they make well you know epic games including unreal and
6107520	6112080	you know the Gears of War here's the deal they have announced sort of that
6112080	6117960	they're doing a PC exclusive project it was mentioned during a PAX East panel
6117960	6122880	the unannounced PC project is under development the plans are to keep the
6122880	6128280	game exclusive to the PC so if you were worried that epic was all about the
6128280	6131800	consoles and I don't know iOS games now because that's the other big thing they
6131800	6137920	did right infinity blade don't worry a PC exclusive title is in the works hmm
6137920	6147160	could be interesting Alan there has been an online petition for the game Dark
6147160	6151960	Souls the sequel to Demon's Souls otherwise known as one of the hardest
6151960	6159520	console games ever this generation the petitions been to bring it on to the PC
6159520	6166400	platform and Atlas has come out and said yes there will be a PC edition of Dark
6166400	6172960	Souls and it's called the Dark Souls prepare to die edition to which anyone
6172960	6178960	that's played the game would say very much yes you will die there was a lot of
6178960	6183360	hype in last few weeks about the game journey I believe it is that sort of has
6183360	6188320	an online element if that's correct Demon's Souls was similar in that when
6188320	6191960	you were fighting in these labyrinths you would fight these ghouls that were
6191960	6197000	actually other players and Demon's Souls has a similar mechanic or sorry Dark
6197000	6202520	Souls has a similar mechanic so yeah it's a very difficult game and it's
6202520	6205760	coming to PC it's one of the few examples of where an online petition was
6205760	6213600	a success it has over 92,000 signatures and it has exclusive bosses to the PC
6213600	6221260	Edition which I'm sure will be just as impossibly hard or even more so so Dark
6221260	6228400	Souls fans on PC you're in luck Skyrim 1.5 patch which I was surprised when I
6228400	6232120	read this story because I've been playing on PC Skyrim 1.5 patch for a
6232120	6240440	couple weeks now is hitting 360 and ps3 this week and it's mostly bug fixes at
6240440	6246800	least two dozen or so bug fixes that were blocking progress on certain quests
6246800	6252760	the big deal though about patch 1.5 Skyrim is that it's it's adding kill
6252760	6259280	moves and kill cinematic like awesome slow-mo bullet cam for projectile
6259280	6263240	weapons like arrows and spells which Skyrim didn't have before and also new
6263240	6267640	kill moves for melee weapons so now not only can you behead people you can fry
6267640	6271480	them you can shoot arrows through their necks and all that other stuff you saw
6271480	6276160	in shaky cam Hunger Games yes they fixed what it looks like when you go underwater
6276160	6282640	and it also looks like they finally fixed the Lydia bug Lydia is the first
6282640	6287640	guard woman that you get and you when you buy a house she if you're wearing an
6287640	6291600	omelet amulet of Mara you should be able to propose to her she's been bugged this
6291600	6298820	whole time since November or whatever so finally they fixed the Lydia bug yes I
6298820	6305920	look for that on Xbox and ps3 this week finally Sonic 4 episode 2 the big 2d
6305920	6312600	HD resurgence of the sonic franchise that kind of came off like a fart in an
6312600	6318840	elevator is getting its episode 2 like everyone's like it sounds so awesome and
6318840	6324760	then it came out and it's no one Kerr it is finally getting its episode 2 and it
6324760	6329240	will likely be the last episode so they are wrapping this up really fast
6329240	6333560	episodic content is the way of the future like we'll give you a part 2
6333560	6336760	because no one like this shit and we don't want to make it anymore so thanks
6336760	6344920	Gabe Newell PSN version will be released on a May 15th XBL a version of Sonic 4
6344920	6350840	episode 2 will be the next day May 16th and PC and mobile versions are I guess
6350840	6357040	confirmed but to be announced later all right that's all let's go to the
6357040	6362440	frugal question of the week oh no we won't go to the frugal question of the
6362440	6367480	week well one quick thing I missed in the theater them story if you're at PAX
6367480	6372960	East you can go check out the oh sorry nevermind it's over yeah it was joke may
6372960	6383760	I do the frugal now absolutely every week we ask you guys a question over at
6383760	6387520	Facebook or Google Plus Facebook put together that's Google that's our concern
6387520	6390880	facebook.com slash orange lounge radio if you want to like us over there and
6390880	6396040	Google Plus slash search for orange lounge radio because we don't get short
6396040	6399880	URLs there I'll start with Google Plus tonight because the very first answer on
6399880	6402880	Google Plus I need to read this because it has something very important in it oh
6402880	6408160	I should tell you guys what the question was just like I forgot to tell you what
6408160	6411040	the question was just then I forgot to give a good question earlier in the week
6411040	6415760	so I made it really easy this week I said how was your gaming week shit we
6415760	6418680	all have to say every night how our gaming weeks were the host of the show
6418680	6421320	so why shouldn't the listeners get a shot so how was your gaming week
6421320	6425580	listeners I especially said what game are you into right now that everybody
6425580	6429600	else should be playing so Derek H starts us off on Google Plus and this is worth
6429600	6433880	mentioning he's playing pinball arcade on Xbox Live arcade but everyone should
6433880	6439520	be playing joust on maim as part of the hunt and I totally forgot to mention
6439520	6444600	this I'm so bad and I had like notes to myself to mention this partly because I
6444600	6448560	had no idea this was happening until Monday of last week after last week
6448560	6452440	show but dark Tetsuya who pretty much writes most of the articles in orange
6452440	6456320	launch radio.com at this point it's either him or act after me me
6456320	6459920	publishing episodes of the show and that's it at this point dark Tetsuya is
6459920	6464880	doing a little contest and it's called the hunt and it's based off of the book
6464880	6467920	ready player one where they kind of do something very similar I don't want to
6467920	6472440	go into all the details but he's doing kind of his own spin of the competition
6472440	6476120	called the hunt and it involves classic video games and being able to get
6476120	6480720	scores that are better than what dark Tetsuya gets and he doesn't really try
6480720	6484520	super hard because he makes it you know beatable so right now the contest he's
6484520	6488640	running is joust and if you can beat a score of 39,000 something so I mean
6488640	6493120	39,800 you take a screen cap of it and either email it to dark Tetsuya or you
6493120	6497000	post it on Twitter and you're gonna get a little copper key and some points that
6497000	6501800	let you into the next round of the competition so joust is the game that
6501800	6505960	they're doing right now I don't know how much longer you have to do it I'm hoping
6505960	6510120	dark Tetsuya will allow a little bit of an extension because if you weren't
6510120	6513440	reading the website you may have missed or seen the Twitter you may have missed
6513440	6518320	this so I'm telling you guys now if you have joust be it in MAME or Xbox Live or
6518320	6522840	whatever fire it up get the score and go on to the next round of the competition
6522840	6527400	because as I understand it right now Derek H is in the lead and well we just
6527400	6532160	we can't we we have to give us a competition you guys Derek H is the guy
6532160	6536480	behind like the big battle and all that stuff so we have to we have to give him
6536480	6539840	a challenge here we don't let him just walk away with everything so I submitted
6539840	6545680	my entry today and I'm gonna try to play in future weeks as well so more
6545680	6549840	information is available on orange lounge radio calm now Derek H also wants
6549840	6555220	to plug you will die on Xbox Live indie games because I get money when people
6555220	6560080	buy it well played well I see what you did there actually you will die is a fun
6560080	6563040	game though like if you like you know your retro shooters he did a good job I
6563040	6567480	did buy it I bought it like two years ago when it first came out so he's
6567480	6573920	probably long spent the money but I did buy it all right uh pwk responded and
6573920	6578680	said I was at my first packs this weekend congratulations I hope you had
6578680	6583080	fun I want to hear more about it Tony M responded and said this is an oldie but
6583080	6587000	after Atlas recently cut the prices of their PSN downloads I've been playing
6587000	6591800	persona 3 portable it's pretty awesome if you're into JRPGs you know persona is
6591800	6595080	one of the series I hear nothing but good things about but I just I personally
6595080	6599200	haven't sat down and played it myself but like I said the same thing about
6599200	6603240	Mass Effect a few months ago on the show I haven't really played it myself but I
6603240	6606280	hear a lot of people are really into it so persona one of these days I'm gonna
6606280	6610720	sit down and play it maybe that's something you could do after Mass Effect
6610720	6614080	play persona is that a serious interest you at all no you did play it before
6614080	6619000	though didn't I have you don't know three and four for ps2 I think might
6619000	6624600	still be shrink-wrapped on this show all right let's go to Facebook read some of
6624600	6628480	the answers there um lots of replies on Facebook I can't possibly read these all
6628480	6632960	but I do want to thank you guys for taking the time to actually answer these
6632960	6637720	let's see another persona Austin W says right now I'm really into persona 4 on
6637720	6641760	PlayStation 2 anyone who is a fan of JRPGs dungeon crawlers and the social
6641760	6648120	character interaction aspect of games should check it out let's see going to
6648120	6653960	Stan says splitting my time between draw something angry bird space push mo on
6653960	6660760	3ds and more Soulcalibur 5 online trying to show off my creative souls Chad C
6660760	6665880	responds and says been playing realm of the mad god it's an MMORPG shooter with
6665880	6672240	85 player groups what free to play on your browser also on steam 35 make
6672240	6678240	download 8-bit graphics perma death kind of sucks when your guy you log 30 plus
6678240	6682320	hours on dies but it's so easy to get into that it won't stop you from playing
6682320	6686960	more what perma death and an MMO that's crazy once you hit level 20 you start
6686960	6691040	gaming gaining fame which allows you to buy keys to unlock more dungeons the
6691040	6694320	final boss is onyx everyone gets teleported to his lair when all quests
6694320	6698960	are completed on your realm and someone kills 2500 mobs the game isn't over when
6698960	6702160	he dies however because you can keep getting gaining fame to unlock harder
6702160	6706840	dungeons and get better loots I don't know this game but it sounds crazy
6706840	6710080	thank you I keep bumping into it but I haven't really taken the plunge myself
6710080	6714040	huh now you knew there were gonna be some people talking about Xenoblade this
6714040	6718280	week so we have Barry M Xenoblade Chronicles on the Wii is an amazing JRPG
6718280	6722480	game much in the vein of Final Fantasy 12 meets my White Knight Chronicles I
6722480	6726440	think that's exactly how I described it when I first reviewed it actually also
6726440	6730280	playing Ragnarok Odyssey on Vita Kid Icarus uprising on 3ds and Tales of
6730280	6736440	Graces F on PlayStation 3 this is a great year for RPG fans Carlos M says
6736440	6741880	I'm halfway through Dragon Age 2 on my 360 and 56 coins and to draw something
6741880	6745840	I'd like that those two games are like on the same level there it's awesome
6745840	6751720	zether simply responds Xenoblade everyone probably knows why and dark
6751720	6755720	soccer would kick me if I didn't say I randomly started playing Portal 2 again
6755720	6761000	I know I know I should be playing Mass Effect yes you should I'm gonna read
6761000	6765440	this comment from unfolded Raptor it's a long one but it's good this past week
6765440	6768880	the blockbuster video in the city I live in was going out of business and had a
6768880	6773000	liquidation sale and had to sell everything so I found a whole bunch of
6773000	6779280	really good PlayStation 3 games for $8 each I ended up buying 15 that I never
6779280	6782360	played yet and probably won't for a while I'm not gonna read all these but
6782360	6787720	like Twisted Metal Demon Souls Deus Ex Bulletstorm there's a ton in here grand
6787720	6791240	total of a hundred and seventy three dollars for those games it's a steal
6791240	6795200	considering at Walmart and even at the evil G the lowest some of these get is
6795200	6799320	around 20 bucks I highly suggest people play Borderlands that they haven't yet
6799320	6802640	it's a ton of fun other than that I've been dedicating myself to Ninja Gaiden
6802640	6806840	3 and have almost finished it I'm loving that as well and I don't see why all the
6806840	6811040	hate for it sometimes I think that people forget how to have fun pretty
6811040	6814000	similar situation in my neck of the woods and I'm sure many other places
6814000	6818760	people people around work were saying you what if there's any movie you've
6818760	6821400	been wanting for a long time go check out the blockbuster right down the hill
6821400	6826760	cuz uh it'll be gone soon I want a blockbuster to go out of business here
6826760	6831120	California props it up a lot better than some of these more sparse well they all
6831120	6834920	went under already years ago red box took over years ago here there's like
6834920	6839400	only I can only think of like where one blockbuster even is there's one over on
6839400	6842880	Folsom below are that I know I'll keep your eye on it for it to go under well
6842880	6848200	okay I will do that it's right next door to Papa Murphy's so we it's like the
6848200	6852680	only pizza chain I'll eat so anymore so all right there you go that was our
6852680	6856200	frugal question of the week thank you guys for responding sorry I didn't read
6856200	6859000	them all but like that was more that since it was such an easy question there
6859000	6866000	was more there than like ever before so let's move on Jason more news electronic
6866000	6871440	arts has been voted the worst American company ever okay not ever but just in
6871440	6875840	2012 so I guess it's actually for 2011 considering the year just started
6875840	6880420	whatever beyond that the consumerist holds an annual tournament to determine
6880420	6884160	the most despised American companies nominations are put to a vote and the
6884160	6888120	ultimate winner is crowned the worst company of this of the year electronic
6888120	6895240	arts congratulations in a poll that took over 250,000 votes EA beat out the Bank
6895240	6900920	of America for its greed and treatment of consumers with a comfortable 64% lead
6900920	6907640	hell hath no fury like a pack of scorned gamers I don't think EA has ever double
6907640	6911480	withdrawn someone's mortgage payment and I know people can be evaded have had
6911480	6916400	that happen so I'm a little skeptical I know the study has been going on for a
6916400	6922480	while but with the timing to the Mass Effect 3 ending wank this seems I timed
6922480	6927560	poorly for the story for me I ate all the popcorn I'd saved for this story
6927560	6933080	because I have not seen such internet lulls like I've seen this week on this
6933080	6937840	story from all facets I mean there's obviously the people that you know voted
6937840	6942120	for this and allowed it to win that just their seething hatred for EA that mostly
6942120	6946560	comes down to everything that happened in Mass Effect and you granted there's
6946560	6951240	the DLC stuff there's I mean I'm not letting an EA off easy here but you know
6951240	6957120	it's not like they're Capcom there's I think EA's kind of taken the burden for
6957120	6961240	everything that everything hey everybody hates with the gaming industry right now
6961240	6965080	I think it's kind of said in that statement but then what also cracks me
6965080	6970480	up is like the people on the consumerist that are like fucking gamers fucking
6970480	6976200	gamers ruining this poll fucking Bank of America is the fucking evilest company
6976200	6981680	in the world what the fuck is wrong with gamers obviously gamers are too poor to
6981680	6987720	own a house and it's like you guys internet polls are really fucking
6987720	6993280	serious business everybody look at your lives look at your choices you are all
6993280	7002000	rabble-rabble ing over an internet poll on some website that is owned by the
7002000	7005240	same people that don't go talk to I think I know no they sold it off years
7005240	7008600	ago but then one time you know what I'm saying it's just who cares it's an
7008600	7014120	internet poll it is not that serious you know what your worst company is and who
7014120	7018800	you're gonna give money to and not and so forth it's it's kind of an individual
7018800	7024520	decision so and meanwhile Activision Blizzard is going to dodge that bullet
7024520	7030320	girl we ain't done shit the rest of this article is a pretty good read I'll leave
7030320	7035200	it verbatim to those who might sneer at something as non-essential as a video
7035200	7039320	game company winning the worst company in American vote it's that exact kind of
7039320	7043800	attitude that allows people to ignore the complaints as companies like EA to
7043800	7048100	nickel-and-dime consumers to death argues the site for years while movies
7048100	7052300	and music became more affordable and publishers piled on bonus content or
7052300	7057240	multiple modes of delivery or multiple modes of delivery is added value to
7057240	7061040	entice customers to buy video games have continued to be priced like premium
7061040	7064920	goods for its exploitation of the downloadable content model the
7064920	7069640	consumerist will be sending EA a little golden poo as a trophy the poo is
7069640	7073180	usually presented on a red pillow but this year the company is sending a
7073180	7078200	choice of colors mocking the controversial Mass Effect 3 ending haha
7078200	7083600	like the Razzies sorry it's okay as gratuitous as EA's deals he is I can't
7083600	7088560	help feeling that it's not quite as bad as illegal foreclosures of or some of
7088560	7093080	the other scummy things the companies in the running did there you go though the
7093080	7099440	internet hath spoken also hath was my addition it said has but there you go
7099440	7106440	and I loved EA put out some response that was very like we don't give a fuck
7106440	7111120	like it was very much like all this money on our naked bodies we don't care
7111120	7118240	it's so amazing no it was very like well I guess Halliburton and Exxon and all of
7118240	7124080	them are really happy that they didn't win the award this year and then pop cap
7124080	7129000	put out a statement that was like you fucking design quality games for 30
7129000	7133000	years I'm paraphrasing clearly you fuck his healthy pop cap would put it that
7133000	7136160	way but it was basically you fucking design games for 30 years that are
7136160	7139240	quality games and try to make the internet happy and see where it gets you
7139240	7145840	but in my opinion that statement as much as I love pop cap I love them a lot but
7145840	7149880	that statement they need to step away from the Borg hive mind that they're
7149880	7152760	starting to become a part of because that's not the reason why EA won this
7152760	7157160	award look at the reason that look at the trends that EA has been starting
7157160	7162040	look at the things that people don't like EA invented the online pass EA you
7162040	7166080	know obviously this whole Mass Effect thing they're taking some of the brunt
7166080	7172120	on that EA sports games every year with no discernible difference is probably
7172120	7176120	the exclusive contract is probably the driving force between behind trying to
7176120	7180720	lock out used gamers in the next gaming cycle you know they want that to happen
7180720	7188240	look at origin Oh God an origin yeah not wanting to play nice with other gaming
7188240	7192520	companies they they refuse basically to play by the normal rules of Xbox Live
7192520	7195960	and we're like either we get to build our own infrastructure or we're not
7195960	7199640	putting our games out on your system and the kind of using that muscle Mass Effect
7199640	7206840	3 isn't on Steam and you know that would sell there exactly so anyway enjoy your
7206840	7212440	golden poo yeah internet polls are very serious business clearly now there's an
7212440	7216080	interesting follow-up to the all this stuff it isn't directly a follow-up to
7216080	7220440	the same same story but there's always going to be that guy that asks what
7220440	7226120	about all the good things EA did and to be fair EA had a couple big stories this
7226120	7230400	week that were some good news so let's cover them one of them which I think all
7230400	7235480	of you have got to be aware of by now but it is out there they have announced
7235480	7243280	that there will be Mass Effect 3 extended cut Mass Effect 3 DLC extended
7243280	7247640	cut is coming out it's going to be coming out this summer it is going to be
7247640	7252920	providing a more fleshed out experience for their fans it's going to bring
7252920	7258080	closure to the ending is there nice PC way of saying we're gonna fix the
7258080	7261980	goddamn ending then fine here's the big thing about it that I got a mid even
7261980	7267240	caught me is my surprise it's gonna be free it's gonna be free through April of
7267240	7272120	2014 or something like that and even then they said they buy aware said they
7272120	7277340	only end dated it because EA has a policy on free DLC has to be end dated
7277340	7281440	and they won't ever charge for it if they can get away with it and it's free
7281440	7285800	because it is not an addition of playable content or missions it is
7285800	7291140	literally you restore a save before the final encounter before all of the
7291140	7297000	expositor expository narrative ending cinematic crap and that visually that
7297000	7302660	you watch is expanded upon so it's free because it's not it's it's additional
7302660	7307920	content but it's not playable some rumors going around that the voice
7307920	7313640	actors for femshep and male Shep have not been asked to come back yet which
7313640	7318500	implies that you know and again I got a I got a tread lightly around the ending
7318500	7324640	here but if they're not in it then how could they really do much of an ending
7324640	7329120	that perhaps it's just gonna be text on the screen all a text I think that's a
7329120	7332440	little bit silly there could be some type of like third-person narration or
7332440	7336980	something going on I could see that happening but or maybe it's gonna be
7336980	7340220	told from somebody else's point of view like years later or something I don't
7340220	7343780	know I think there's still a lot they could do with it that even though they
7343780	7347400	don't have the voice actors back but it sounds like again the Internet's already
7347400	7352120	not happy with it well it's it's not a new ending which is what people are
7352120	7355740	demanding they're like throw this shit that you put in the game out give us
7355740	7359720	something completely different but they wear that there I was like no this is
7359720	7364560	our artistic you know point of view so it's not a different ending and it's not
7364560	7368120	any new ending choices they are just fleshing out what's already there yeah
7368120	7372240	trying to explain it more or what have you so in a way it's kind of like saying
7372240	7378240	well it's very metaphorical and up to your imagination and you didn't get it
7378240	7383000	so if you didn't get it then here's we're gonna throw you a bone so what do
7383000	7387760	you think about the fact that the internet got their way well they didn't
7387760	7391920	they didn't I mean they're getting something else I'm actually I'm legit
7391920	7395180	surprised they're doing it for free and I said a few weeks ago on the show I
7395180	7398840	said if they don't put it out for free then they're just assholes and to my
7398840	7401920	surprise they're doing it for free so I have to stand by what I said and that is
7401920	7406480	that it's hard to complain about this I feel that they only really did this
7406480	7411240	because their analysts or whatever saw evidence of an actual fist fiscal impact
7411240	7414960	with the fact that Amazon was accepting Mass Effect 3 returns as a defective
7414960	7420040	product I know that's really cynical and pessimistic it's nice that they're
7420040	7424480	throwing the Phantom of fandom a bone but you know if EA has the final say
7424480	7429580	this is just damage control to say that they they attempted something even if
7429580	7435340	fandom still hates it and I think that their hands were forced because they
7435340	7438960	could possibly lose money off of the degree of butthurt that the Phantom was
7438960	7447640	showing so as far as the fact that them them getting getting their way but they
7447640	7450940	kind of didn't get their way they didn't they didn't I mean it's gonna be really
7450940	7453600	hard to say until it comes out but I just I think there's gonna be a lot of
7453600	7458960	people that still aren't happy with it imagine if the internet it was what it
7458960	7466960	is today with Final Fantasy 7 right oh no game will ever be as hyped up or as
7466960	7473160	anticipated as Final Fantasy 7 was but we kind of just had to eat shit and deal
7473160	7476560	with it was kind of a jank ending we didn't really have the outlet or
7476560	7483280	resources to freak out on a company like this but what happened to you fee who
7483280	7489120	feet visit what do you mean what happened they weren't even there exactly all right
7489120	7492840	I think a lot of people probably already made up their mind on this DLC though
7492840	7498920	did you have anything to say Jason I'm just effect so I I will probably get
7498920	7503000	around to the series eventually but yeah not yet completely missed it well here's
7503000	7507680	something that impacts Mass Effect and it's and some other Bioware games it's
7507680	7511640	something Bioware is kind of known for and Bioware obviously tells these very
7511640	7516920	deep stories and sometimes romance is an option in these stories and Bioware has
7516920	7522680	been in many ways a pioneer for any type of relationship you want meaning if you
7522680	7524920	want to be in a straight relationship or if you want to be in a gay relationship
7524920	7531640	and they're starting to get some pushback for that and EA is EA who owns
7531640	7535840	Bioware is kind of the target of all this there is an anti gay letter writing
7535840	7540360	campaign going on right now EA's received several thousand letters
7540360	7546400	objecting to same-sex relationships in their games the letters are being sent
7546400	7551200	to a variety of senior leaders at EA threatening to boycott EA games until it
7551200	7556920	changes its policy EA is standing by it say standing by their games saying they
7556920	7561920	will continue to include LGBT characters in their games as options every one of
7561920	7566160	EA's games includes ESRB content descriptors so it's hard to believe
7566160	7569840	anyone is surprised by the content this isn't about protecting children it's
7569840	7574840	about political harassment that's from EA's chief spokesperson Jeff Brown
7574840	7581760	obviously Mass Effect 3 allows you to do man woman man man woman woman woman
7581760	7587960	alien shit you can do whatever you want in Mass Effect and Mass Effect 1 was
7587960	7592960	originally going to have same gendered pairings but with Dragon Age Origins
7592960	7596320	coming out on the horizon which had a more involved relationship system they
7596320	7600760	cut that content out and let Dragon Age Origins set that precedent mm-hmm and
7600760	7605720	Mass Effect 1 sorry to interrupt took a lot of heat from conservative funding
7605720	7610920	groups for having sex at all and many people having a sexual machine which
7610920	7614320	isn't like it's not that much more than you'd see on an episode of like nip tuck
7614320	7619840	or something I mean for real anyhow Star Wars the Old Republic is going to be
7619840	7623640	having same-sex relationships it's been reported and some people are not happy
7623640	7628560	with that because they don't they only see it as Star Wars like oh that movie I
7628560	7633800	loved in 1978 it's gonna get the homos we can't have that
7633800	7639440	later ain't no homo of course it almost had incest slightly so although that is
7639440	7645720	completely right although that is completely incest is a okay but heaven
7645720	7651600	forbid Vader be a homo which isn't even how it works Star Wars the Old Republic
7651600	7656200	takes place thousands of years before the movies and all that it's completely
7656200	7658840	different and saying it should be noted same-sex relationships aren't in the
7658840	7665920	game yet it's been noted for a future patch it will be in the game the letters
7665920	7671920	are coming from Florida the where the Florida Family Association is at and
7671920	7677320	again EA is standing by it but I mean they're doing these it's clearly a form
7677320	7680920	letter and if you look at the form letters like people will hand write
7680920	7684320	messages on them that say like remembers like look at this one there's a
7684320	7688640	handwritten message here you'll get a kick out of this thank you remember
7688640	7693760	Sodom and then it's signed I had a friend who turned into salt last week so
7693760	7700200	that shit is real and you will not minimize that that still happens can I
7700200	7705920	read can I read the hate mail here dear mr. Riccitello it was troubling to learn
7705920	7710560	that Bioware and Electronic Arts were pressured into committing to add
7710560	7718000	LGBT content to Star Wars video games pressured by who they always announced
7718000	7724000	it was going to be there I am also concerned that Bioware employees state
7724000	7728960	in postings at SWTOR.com that they have been censoring deleting and banning
7728960	7733600	forum members for expressing opposing views about including homosexual content
7733600	7739560	in the games children play guess what on a person's private forum the First
7739560	7745600	Amendment does not exist for example if you're a guest in my home and you start
7745600	7748960	talking like you know imagine if we invite somebody over let's say Jason's
7748960	7753260	our guest and we invite Jason over in our house and Jason says you know I
7753260	7758120	really hate faggots and I don't know how you and Alan can be faggots together
7758120	7763040	what's gonna happen we're gonna throw him out right we're gonna we're gonna
7763040	7765840	ban him right we're gonna kick him out of our house and he's not allowed to
7765840	7769200	come here anymore obviously he wouldn't do that but I'm just he's sitting right
7769200	7772800	there and he's an example this is the same analogy here if you come into
7772800	7775680	somebody's house and say something they don't like they have every right to
7775680	7781740	remove you you don't get a First Amendment yeah the overwhelming number
7781740	7785880	of players on Star Wars games is children who do not need to be forced as
7785880	7790000	a captured audience to participate in homosexual content thirty-year-old
7790000	7794280	children living in their parents basement whoa whoa whoa again if you're
7794280	7798040	letting your child play an MMO unsupervised they're not getting that
7798040	7804600	$14.99 a month themselves someone's credit card uh-huh we ask that you
7804600	7808840	please adhere to your long-term policy of omitting and steering clear of this
7808840	7816640	type of advocacy representation in your games what EA had a policy no please do
7816640	7820760	not include LGBT content in Star Wars video games that will impact so many
7820760	7827600	children thank you remember Sodom there it I mean the facts are just being
7827600	7833440	distorted terribly I mean that this is here's the thing about this though is
7833440	7838160	that you know these people don't fucking play video games because video games all
7838160	7844240	together are the goddamn devil yep so there's no there's no real boycott
7844240	7849160	happening here this is all for show it's all for press it's all for show it's
7849160	7854160	just like those idiots that get out there at the funerals that say God hates
7854160	7858920	fags and you're burning in hell because America embraces fat mr. Rogers is
7858920	7864160	burning in hell because you know America's a fag-loving country and all
7864160	7867080	this I hate that I'm using that word so much tonight but unfortunately I see it
7867080	7872960	in these you know protests and things like that and it's just they do it what
7872960	7879080	for attention for those that remember I know this isn't all that similar but
7879080	7883920	when nipplegate happened with Janet Jackson at the Super Bowl the FCC came
7883920	7887040	out and said that for all the thousands of complaints that they got it was some
7887040	7892660	random group that was made up of 20 icky old creepy old white dudes that just had
7892660	7896640	a form letter and they spammed the shit out of the FCC so the the fact that
7896640	7901400	they're getting as many complaints isn't really representative of how the public
7901400	7905640	feels because these these are just really isolated groups telling that
7905640	7909800	they're following to send this form letter dozens of times and that adds up
7909800	7915360	that makes it's just people making a fuss because they have nothing better to
7915360	7919960	do with their lives they this is what they choose to do instead of going out
7919960	7925240	into their community and choosing to do some good because what Alan and I have
7925240	7930480	is so threatening there is no gay agenda because we're either at the bar or the
7930480	7938160	gym we don't have time stop you Amy stop it anyway so it's even I love that they
7938160	7942280	scan this in its signed I can't read that name is that homa Johnson home no
7942280	7959760	homa Jay Lorne homa Jay Lorne dear homa Jay Lorne shut the fuck up anyhow prop
7959760	7965160	CEA at least for standing by this whole thing because you know what I gotta say
7965160	7969920	this even though I haven't played Mass Effect 3 myself yet I spoiled myself and
7969920	7973120	looked at some of the stuff on YouTube I've looked at all the different romance
7973120	7977520	scenes I've looked at the female female I've looked at the male female I've
7977520	7981160	looked at the male-male relationships and I got to tell you the male-male
7981160	7985480	relationship that they do one of the one in particular they do in the game is so
7985480	7992280	well done it's it's kind of refreshing to see that it's a relationship that's
7992280	7997960	not about the bar or the gym or any of that stuff it's it's really touching and
7997960	8005400	they do it so well and so tastefully like I just can't believe people are so
8005400	8009860	offended by it they want to take it out of the game stupid if this is what
8009860	8018240	earned EA a big golden poo hold it up high right let's move on I'm all huffy
8018240	8022960	now after that story well let's do the mailbag let's follow that up with some
8022960	8027280	listener emails you know what the people I like to hear from let's do some
8027280	8038040	listener emails every week you guys send us emails you mailbag at orange lounge
8038040	8041680	radio.com and dark soccer opens up the email bag and read some of her favorites
8041680	8049120	but she's not here tonight we took a poo in the bag and detrimental to ourselves
8049120	8053360	isn't it here all right no there are there are some good emails tonight and
8053360	8058520	Alan's gonna read them tonight will writes us and asks can't remember if
8058520	8062440	this has been brought up on olr yet or not but have any of you checked out the
8062440	8068480	web series titled cron tendo it's one dude playing every single Famicom slash
8068480	8075000	nest game release in chronological order oh my god he plays them enough to give a
8075000	8079420	basic review and some history of the title needless to say it's a massive
8079420	8082840	undertaking and worth checking out he has a YouTube channel but much more
8082840	8089520	content is posted on the archive org site he also started a cron Sega series
8089520	8094360	which is going through all of the master system titles in order the humor is
8094360	8098800	pretty dry but fun to watch anyone wanting to know more retro gaming history
8098800	8104920	or looking for some old games to play will want to give it a look man some
8104920	8112000	people have a lot of time I think it's great it's a great endeavor though I saw
8112000	8116880	similar linked me to it might have been dark Sakura actually a group of let's
8116880	8121660	play people on YouTube there's four of them they did a simultaneous battle
8121660	8125920	toads the original that game is hard as hell it's it's on YouTube but it's quad
8125920	8130480	screen just a competition to see who could get reach the end of the game the
8130480	8134200	fastest and it's filled with swears because that game is hard now is very
8134200	8138240	fun so look up about battle toads competition for that second email is
8138240	8143840	from Stan who writes hi olr I have a question for you and anyone listening or
8143840	8148640	this could be a future fool question what video game franchise would you like
8148640	8153760	to see reimagined or translated into another genre for example the morrows
8153760	8160720	the Mario for example the Mario series was fantastic as an RPG yes my answer
8160720	8164840	would be seen the Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy characters be introduced
8164840	8169960	in a Soul Calibur game so like Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy well there was
8169960	8175640	our guys you want to kind of stretch it a little bit I also think it'd be funny
8175640	8182400	to see Grand Theft Auto reimagined as a Japanese dating sim game now that's just
8182400	8189800	silly signed Stan sent from his iPhone and he's very upset about the Instagram
8189800	8194840	news this week no um gosh that's that's a tough one what would I like to see
8194840	8202320	cross genres and persona 4 is getting a fighting game and I saw that email from
8202320	8208240	Alice and I was like what how about an 8-bit version of demon souls like the
8208240	8213520	platforming game where it dials up on a modem it's just basic online no it's
8213520	8220880	just asshole Mario is all you guys have heard of the the the portal mod for the
8220880	8225320	original Mario one haven't you oh yeah the Mario with the stylized oh yeah have
8225320	8228960	you heard what the latest update is gonna be I think I heard something about
8228960	8234480	soundtrack six player co-op now that sounds fun yeah not exactly cross genre
8234480	8239440	unless you want to say it's portal being ported to 8-bit sidescroller that that
8239440	8245840	yeah that question is really insanely difficult yeah my mind is just stuck in
8245840	8250160	the fact that Super Mario RPG was freaking gorgeous and that was like the
8250160	8254120	first RPG that ever really meant something to me and I actually I think

8258680	8263000	half-bad partners in time I didn't get far enough into but was still pretty fun
8263000	8270000	I mean a Disney RPG Kingdom Hearts was grand I don't I don't know that there's
8270000	8273680	one specific series that would mean something to me in a different genre
8273680	8277760	though that I could really pick yeah this is a hard one especially because I
8277760	8280320	didn't really think about it beforehand like I'm trying to look through my game
8280320	8283000	collection right now and see if anything jumps out of my eye is like something
8283000	8288260	I'd want different Alan did anything come to mind for you at all I'm still

8359880	8363320	shooter type person but the map the combat Mass Effect is pretty darn good I
8363320	8366400	guess I really wouldn't change it I did hear though they were doing that legit
8366400	8369160	first-person shooter out of Mass Effect and that would've been kind of fun to
8369160	8374240	play I think yeah us to move the music game as an RPG kind of dance summit
8374240	8380360	style yeah cuz you got kitty Ann and then you know she could cast spells

8452880	8461000	sheep so think for yourselves F you to sheep Alan I guess F you to the fact

8504080	8509800	forgetting how to get out of a door of a car I have this really nasty gash on the
8509800	8513960	right side of my head because I apparently when I grabbed my bag in turn
8513960	8517160	to get out of the backseat of a car I leaned forward and just completely
8517160	8521240	knocked the corner of the door it hurt a whole hell of a lot and it looks pretty
8521240	8526320	nasty and it feels kind of nasty but anti F you to immune systems and the
8526320	8530880	ability to recover from that and I think there was another thing something about
8530880	8535800	keys and doors and where I'm staying while I'm out here but I think I think
8535800	8539000	the injury made me forget it so I guess I don't have it right now if anyone asks
8539000	8543600	story though if anyone asks someone tried to mug you and you beat the shit
8543600	8548360	out of them and that's the little mark or tell him it's a sex injury let him
8548360	8551520	try to figure it out I think I was coming up with some kind of I I tried to
8551520	8555400	participate I was a casted for the role of something and face-off and that was
8555400	8559280	the suspicion mark they tested to see how how good my face bar fight bar fight

8598240	8601800	making it to iOS which will arrive this summer you may remember a couple months
8601800	8607040	ago Capcom decided to make a very similar game by the name of Max explosion
8607040	8611300	that came out on iOS and there was a little a little a little kerfuffle
8611300	8615520	between the two studios Capcom and twisted pixel twisted pixel says well
8615520	8620180	you know Capcom made Megaman so I guess it's not all that bad and drama ceased
8620180	8624920	very quickly miss explosion man was obviously the hit sequel to the original
8624920	8629440	explosion man both Xbox Live arcade titles miss explosion man is heading to
8629440	8634160	the App Store with a version for steam on the PC games for Windows Live another

8640100	8644060	release date just sometime this summer if you were at PAX East maybe you played
8644060	8650520	it and if the game differs in any way call in let us know I am legit excited
8650520	8654140	about this game that I'm about to talk about and it's kind of sad when you get
8654140	8658560	more excited about the portable version of a game then the console version of a
8658560	8663840	game but you I have legit reason for this guy's epic Mickey of course is
8663840	8667340	getting epic Mickey 2 on the consoles which you know is all fine and dandy
8667340	8673400	whatever still we right we Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 okay so good for them
8673400	8681480	stepping it up but on the 3ds Disney epic Mickey power of illusion oh yes
8681480	8687240	it's what it sounds like it's a basic I don't want to say a sequel to but
8687240	8694920	heavily inspired by castle of illusion oh my god that game was gorgeous for its
8694920	8700320	day and a really amazing platformer oh my god and now it's gonna be on the 3ds
8700320	8705840	and it's going to incorporate yet you get to draw objects that magically
8705840	8709960	transform into Disney style 2d illustrations and then they're gonna be
8709960	8715240	3d on the 3ds is top screen blah blah blah but it gets its influence from a
8715240	8720080	lot of modern-day Disney movies like Tangled is gonna have a level and yeah
8720080	8724880	I'm so excited about this Beauty and the Beast from the screenshots here you can
8724880	8731440	see I mean it's just got that right mix of like retro look to it no Tron no sale
8731440	8736120	you never know you never know Peter Pan Tron is in that Kingdom Hearts game
8736120	8743320	coming out dreamed up distance so it just looks gorgeous I'm so excited like
8743320	8747260	I could care less now about the console one just bring me that 3ds game you guys
8747260	8753840	is a 3ds game I'm excited about yeah it's not just a port a 3d port of a
8753840	8757720	client of a good classic game like Zelda Rama in the chat room put it best I
8757720	8762560	can't say it any better myself shut up and take my money
8762560	8771200	amen Allen so this story is a doozy wow I'm not sure how to report this I guess
8771200	8775640	I wanted you to do this for a reason I guess the state of Arizona just looked
8775640	8779760	at Florida is the worst state of in the country and was like no we have to do
8779760	8784760	better and and for the last seven or eight years they have been okay so this
8784760	8790720	story is about a bill that has passed the both sides of the state legislature
8790720	8796520	so it's ready to be signed by the governor and it's the anti trolling
8796520	8801280	cyberbullying bill is it just me or does the governor of Arizona kind of reminds
8801280	8807280	you a Cruella de Vil like I'm not sure he's the one who put her finger in the
8807280	8810960	face of Obama yeah yeah just like don't doesn't she remind you of Cruella de
8810960	8814120	Vil a little bit like I'm not trying to get political or whatever and I'm not
8814120	8820780	it's it's just she's kind of nasty anyway sorry didn't mean to derail you
8820780	8824160	yeah so it passed both houses it's waiting for the governor to sign it a
8824160	8831720	governor Brewer and basically if let me read exactly what the the statute
8831720	8838880	dictates it is unlawful for any person with intent to terrify intimidate
8838880	8846680	threaten harass annoy or offend to use any electronic or digital device digital
8846680	8851560	device and use any obscene lewd or profane language or suggest any lewd or
8851560	8856920	lascivious act or threaten to inflict personal harm to the person or property
8856920	8862480	of any person so you cannot be shitty to people on the internet if the recipient
8862480	8867420	is in Arizona because if they try to prosecute you it could be a class one I
8867420	8874040	think misdemeanor which I want to say the maximum fine for that is $2,500 and
8874040	8878020	up to six months in jail is that the right direction that the receiver has to
8878020	8882280	be in Arizona I kind of figured it would have been the cinder the origin oh that
8882280	8889080	that is actually addressed here let me find it sorry yeah come arrest me
8889080	8895320	Arizona sucks what are you gonna do about it there are already exceptions to
8895320	8899040	the First Amendment which is freedom of speech which is which is obscene and
8899040	8904480	obscenity is very vague and also inciting violence site like saying this
8904480	8907960	person should get beat up let's all meet at the place in time that's inciting
8907960	8912040	violence but just being an asshole on the internet you know think of the penny
8912040	8917800	arcade greater internet theory have you ever read the comments to a story on
8917800	8927620	yahoo news oh my god they would fill the jails in Arizona overnight I'm fucking
8927620	8932000	serious go read the comments to any story on yahoo news story any of them or
8932000	8936360	the answers on yahoo answers it could be a story about like fluffy kitties and
8936360	8940960	dogs and it'll be like that dog is fucking ugly and it looks like an Obama
8940960	8945760	dog because Obama's ugly and all like this this is what oh my god I gotta go
8945760	8950000	to yahoo news right now and give you an idea what I mean here a whole new level
8950000	8955360	of quality for the show huh this is important because yes and this is this
8955360	8960440	is how it ties into the gaming world because of course what did gamers love
8960440	8966360	to do more than anything troll be shitty to each other with no consequences which
8966360	8970760	I guess this bill is trying to fix and if this bill does get signed it's like
8970760	8976040	many bills that California itself has had where it's effective as law for like
8976040	8979040	a minute and then it immediately gets shoved into the courts and it's
8979040	8982960	unenforceable and it gets juggled around in the courts to decide if it's
8982960	8987280	constitutional not for years and eventually goes away so already you know
8987280	8989780	people are saying that this is way too vague and there's no way this is
8989780	8994280	enforceable and blah blah blah and call me a grammar Nazi unless that's illegal
8994280	9000040	in this state but the text of the the text of this bill is it's one of those
9000040	9004160	things like for some reason there have been these weird weird quirk grammar
9004160	9010120	stories in the news lately notably talking about the the talking about a
9010120	9014720	the new iPad because they only referred to it during the keynote as the new
9014720	9020880	iPad so if anybody says I want the iPad 3 no you want a the new iPad but you you
9020880	9024560	read you read the text of the particular statute and what jumped out to me
9024560	9029280	immediately was it is unlawful for any for any person with intent intimidate
9029280	9036180	blah blah blah to use a any electronic or digital device it is unlawful for any
9036180	9043080	person to use a any electric or digital device is one little letter I don't I
9043080	9047160	don't mean to like narrow in on this but it's just kind of like the language
9047160	9050360	already sucks but to throw something in there that just doesn't make any damn
9050360	9056400	sense come on guys so if I write something rude on the side of a toaster
9056400	9062560	incentive trolling here's I just fucking arrest you in Arizona because you're
9062560	9067480	trolling you are now a wanted criminal in Arizona since the bill stipulates
9067480	9072600	that the offense only has to occur on Arizona soil that basically puts the
9072600	9079400	entire internet on notice according to this article so if the infraction
9079400	9085080	allegedly is it is viewable within Arizona which of course Facebook last I
9085080	9089840	check doesn't filter themselves out of Arizona maybe they should now that'll
9089840	9094200	make the people in Arizona really happy Google already block YouTube in Arizona
9094200	9098680	yet yeah that'll probably be in next week's stories we out so if the
9098680	9104820	infraction is you can view it from an Arizona network then you I guess
9104820	9108720	according to this bill have the right to try and prosecute the narrow mindedness
9108720	9115360	of something that in their dream little world could affect to the whole freaking
9115360	9123960	world another addition to this is that if the trolling is contributing proof
9123960	9129040	if you're able to prove that it's attributing to actual stalking of a
9129040	9133020	person then that would bring it up to a class 3 felony and there's a whole
9133020	9138480	additional cache of stalking laws that would then be brought into this I guess
9138480	9144400	it's supposed to be a countermeasure to cyberbullying which I do believe kids
9144400	9148320	have killed kids have killed themselves because of hate pages made like this
9148320	9153400	page that someone is you know a fat slut on Facebook that's shitty and parents
9153400	9157440	and teachers should get involved so cyberbullying sucks but an anti trolling
9157440	9162640	bill is not the way to go about it at least not the way it's written so some
9162640	9166640	sections of Yahoo News have apparently switched to requiring Facebook logins
9166640	9171560	which I guess a lot but here let me give you an example here's a story on
9171560	9178360	President Obama wishes Jews Christians happy Passover Easter so what's the harm
9178360	9181560	in the president wishing people a happy holiday for whatever it is they believe
9181560	9186920	it right nothing wrong with that right let's see
9186920	9193280	Jack Haynes says Obama stop lying we know you're a secret Muslim Bob Harvey
9193280	9198960	says Muslim use a fabric Bob Harvey says I'd vote for Reagan's corpse before I
9198960	9204000	vote for this egotistical clueless inept narcissist there actually is a story
9204000	9208680	about a dead politician beating an alive one Jack Van Valen says did he get the
9208680	9216840	okay from the Muslim Brotherhood like and the thing if you if you are
9216840	9223960	Republican Democrat whatever I don't I don't care you Romney Obama just don't
9223960	9228920	fucking vote for Rick Santorum seriously oh my god like that I draw the fucking
9228920	9233880	line at that asshole but I mean he is the president scroll up what's the
9233880	9240080	headline again Obama wishes President Obama wishes Jews Christians happy
9240080	9245000	Passover Easter the White House Christmas card from this most recent
9245000	9248600	December was I think their cat or their dog I don't remember what fucking pet
9248600	9253760	they have it just said happy holidays that's it no Merry Christmas or Hanukkah
9253760	9257160	or anything happy holidays with no Christmas tree and no nativity and the
9257160	9262400	Christians flipped their shit now he's wishing Christians and Jews a Passover
9262400	9272320	some Christian sorry flip their shit yes so it's yeah can't win for losing any
9272320	9278560	how it's okay if you're Muslim all right now that Christian or at you can't we
9278560	9282840	all just get along holidays of advertising past all right now only if
9282840	9291920	you're in Arizona all right look less politics more gaming stories Jason help
9291920	9298600	with well I guess it's not exactly politics but cute childish I owe cute
9298600	9304760	iOS app childhoods end back online after pedo bear mix-up Apple was worried it
9304760	9309160	might be a recruiting tool for pedophiles essentially what this boils
9309160	9312960	down to is that there was a tower defense game called childhoods end which
9312960	9321760	featured large bears converging on the point where you would die in a tower
9321760	9326480	defense scenario and the developer submitted an update and the one
9326480	9331840	particular Apple the one particular App Store reviewer got a hold of it and said
9331840	9337840	why is pedal bear advancing on a childhood game and they they sent the
9337840	9341840	developer a notice that they will need to take extended time they will be they
9341840	9345480	will need additional time for an extended review and immediately followed
9345480	9349000	that up with direct contact with the developer and expressing their concern
9349000	9352460	and caution over the subject matter I've never heard of this app before and I
9352460	9357760	looked at a I looked at a lot of stuff about it but perhaps one of the things
9357760	9361960	that doesn't exactly help why were you so interested in a pedo bear app I'm
9361960	9369000	just researching the story the description of the app says use your
9369000	9373800	wits and tactics to guide big Phil along his quest in this engrossing defense
9373800	9379320	game with towers join big Phil now and help him navigate his adolescence as he
9379320	9383760	fights off the evil teddy bears of his childhood your tactical skills and with
9383760	9387560	a little bit of luck is all big Phil needs to see him through his teenage
9387560	9393960	years not exactly the childish that you would expect but you know you know
9393960	9399360	what's in a name there's a couple things coming out about the this article I
9399360	9403080	haven't exactly understood what exactly this is but they put a there's a
9403080	9409680	screenshot of the in-game bears versus a picture of pedo bear and saying of
9409680	9413160	course the image is broken now so I can't recite it off but it's it's it's
9413160	9417160	drawing a contrast that this is a teddy bear you will see it in almost any
9417160	9422280	American child's home that has stuffed animals why is this a big deal I mean we
9422280	9426120	know why it's a big deal but this particular version just makes no sense
9426120	9431600	the the game was subtly changed the art for the bear was changed a little bit
9431600	9438720	at the update resubmitted and I believe it's been approved at this point now
9438720	9445360	Peter bear free yeah if one of those things said it's a silly situation for
9445360	9451200	something that probably didn't need to happen but it did so man you know one
9451200	9455000	more news story for you guys before we get to the calls and as if this show
9455000	9461480	couldn't go any further down the toilet I think this news story is kind of like
9461480	9466040	it's trolling that somehow is traveling across the game blogosphere because this
9466040	9471040	guy can't be fucking serious I'll go governor Brewer well the arrest this
9471040	9477640	man it is who did this it was Camille german pres I'm sorry if I butchered
9477640	9483680	that name but Camille german pres talked about studio are kato's they made the
9483680	9487960	game hell yeah for Sega it's one of their first games to come out they're
9487960	9490400	taking a month off and then they're gonna come back and do some more games
9490400	9496000	but saying it's a guess packs East booth the comment was quote we're gonna make
9496000	9504660	two games one game on P and one game on poo yes that's right one game on P one
9504660	9513240	game about P and one game about poo it's going to be a steam game I think okay
9513240	9517560	and yeah it's on I swear to God it's on every game blog go go look at any of them
9517560	9525800	and this to peepee poo-poo presented with no comment is that what I just heard
9525800	9531480	do I need to comment on this story about what is there possibly I mean can we set
9531480	9536640	the bar we already had news stories about the the urinal games where they
9536640	9542440	were installing games on the urinals for men to play or you know women if they
9542440	9550640	want an extra challenge while they relieve themselves women get the metal
9550640	9557360	gear solid version where no one catches them in the bathroom cuz that might be
9557360	9566040	kind of awkward for my birthday will you get me the pea and poo plush dolls that

9703240	9707960	PAX East this is your third PAX East where does this rank because I was
9707960	9713160	reading some negative negativities on Twitter the negativities are probably
9713160	9715720	coming from the people that were complaining about the fact it was the
9715720	9720040	same weekend as anime Boston hey look people if you gone to more than five to
9720040	9723240	six anime conventions in a year it wouldn't kill you to go to a gaming
9723240	9727280	convention which was a hell of a lot better just just please shower while
9727280	9730380	you're at the convention that's all we ask I actually at the game you can at
9730380	9738920	this one there was a lot of showering there was very little confunk laughing
9738920	9743700	because act-deaf in the chat room the pee and poo dolls might be out of stock
9743700	9750720	but now there's an HIV plushie so oh geez and the habit there it's in a
9750720	9756800	family with a hepatitis C and a tuberculosis and polio I love the

9794040	9799560	the back of the expo hall but packed all the damn time there were people
9799560	9806320	wandering around checking out lotro and D&D online and one other thing that
9806320	9809640	packs does a lot of too is that they just have like it's not just about the
9809640	9813080	new games or whatever this on the show floor but there's like like people
9813080	9819360	sitting in the hallways playing card games and people playing D&D in rooms

10293600	10299360	at Becky's house playing with her son in the backyard that was very grassy very
10299360	10304840	allergic to grass and I started stuffing up like right after that and Friday I
10304840	10309680	was just sniffy got a sniffy over and then started hacking so that's why I

10354720	10359120	hear you know check in say hello the phone's ringing off the hook tonight hi
10359120	10363680	you're on orange on radio who's this so Shane hi Shane what's up I'm playing
10363680	10367240	World of Warcraft that's what's up did you go to PAX East this weekend I
10367240	10373880	totally didn't so why are you calling I don't know why are you calling you you
10373880	10377280	called us what do you want what's on what's on your mind um I wanted to
10377280	10381520	respond to the EA getting the worst company of the year thing or whatever
10381520	10386520	uh-huh I totally after reading EA statement that they put out I felt
10386520	10392160	really bad for them and I kind of feel like the internet won and lost because
10392160	10397920	they were just way too loud and they should not have you know beaten Bank of
10397920	10402080	America of all people you do realize in their statement they need like they said
10402080	10406640	well at least it wasn't Halliburton or did it and yeah they named like three of
10406640	10411320	the prior winners of the contest I didn't know their prior winners but
10411320	10415760	still I don't I don't think they should have even come close to winning I think
10415760	10419440	there were a lot of other companies up there that I saw and they're like half a
10419440	10424200	picture I would see on Kotaku when I'd sadly go to their site like I think I
10424200	10428240	saw a Best Buy up there which they deserve to be up there I think I saw I
10428240	10432680	think I saw AT&T which deserved to be up there here's the thing though here's the
10432680	10437560	thing does it really matter it's just the internet it's a poll on the internet
10437560	10441680	no honestly I guess it's publicity and you know the whole saying about
10441680	10447740	publicity and stuff and it's never bad blah blah blah well right after we
10447740	10450740	reported on that we turned around and talked about a couple good things that
10450740	10454120	EA is doing and I'm sure you have opinions on these so first yes the Mass
10454120	10460480	Effect 3 ending um I'm torn I appreciate what they're doing it's still not what I
10460480	10465380	would like but one of the writers clarified some things this week on
10465380	10471200	Twitter and it sounds like a lot of the doom and gloom that people inferred from
10471200	10476640	the endings were because the writers thought we were smarter than that but
10476640	10480520	you know that's a stupid thing to think when you're basing it off of things
10480520	10483360	you've seen in the game for the past however many years the series has been
10483360	10491040	going so I'm excited to see the extended cut I know it's not going to satisfy me
10491040	10495360	though because it's not what I exactly want which you know that's an impossible
10495360	10503600	request anyway I kind of I mean can they do anything to make you happy though um
10503600	10509320	yes what they could do is make a Mass Effect 4 with all my same characters and
10509320	10515200	just make a new story and keep it going cuz I am not done with Shepard or any of
10515200	10521000	my crew members even the ones that may or may not have died in 3 and so you're
10521000	10526240	trying to sleep with and continuing your relationship with yes especially Caden
10526240	10532320	and you want a more explicit Mass Effect 4 no no but better romance scenes would
10532320	10538280	be nice because it's it's like you know maybe a ten-year-old came up with them
10538280	10543120	and they didn't have any concept of what a relationship is besides like kissing
10543120	10548040	and holding hands and maybe like hitting the other person every so often well
10548040	10551360	wait a minute though okay let's get into the other story which is about the whole
10551360	10555280	target of the EA is a target of the anti-gay campaign so you've you've
10555280	10559120	obviously romanced Kaidan with your with your man Shep so your benefits yeah
10559120	10566320	you're benefiting from the content that they've put in the game a do you think
10566320	10571280	this campaign means anything no it's just something for that stupid
10571280	10577240	organization to do this week cuz they pick something new every week and B well
10577240	10582880	you kind of like showed me these scenes that you know the the man-on-man with
10582880	10588200	Kaidan and all that and how well done they were well they're well done well
10588200	10593520	okay wait wait let me back up the romance scene is not well done once you
10593520	10598560	get into the romance part but like the date scene and the conversations they
10598560	10604400	have brilliant because I aware for the most part can write amazingly well but
10604400	10609440	they need to learn a thing or two about romance scenes cuz Dragon Age that was
10609440	10613540	laughable I didn't see Mass Effect 1 I didn't do anything in two because you
10613540	10618440	know saving myself for Kaidan and in three it's like let me get pushed down
10618440	10622360	on the bed and then we're gonna roll around for like half a second and oh
10622360	10625680	we're under covers now and we're sleeping okay but it's not like they're
10625680	10634060	gonna get porno on you you know but it was also more like can't spoil things it
10634060	10642100	was like a shirtless scene of something that you do earlier in the game with
10642100	10649360	another crew member that isn't romantic at all wrestling well there's like a
10649360	10654340	like a little sparring match that's kind of what it reminded me of except we had
10654340	10661660	no pants all right pants in the sparring match all right but but otherwise I
10661660	10665880	mean it's certainly more interesting than what we've probably seen in any
10665880	10671080	other video game wouldn't you say probably more interesting you know the
10671080	10674320	male male or female female stuff we've seen in other games which has been
10674320	10680400	remarkably little but I'm sure in other games there have been better male female
10680400	10686680	romance scenes because I assume that the developers are probably straight and
10686680	10690200	have more experience with that like they couldn't just load up like a porn
10690200	10694200	website okay that is pretty blanket statement to make though I mean there's
10694200	10697840	probably hundreds of people that work at Bioware I'm sure there's a couple people
10697840	10702040	there that have some you know first-hand experience well I'm saying the ones that
10702040	10706960	that designed the scene not that worked there period gotcha sure they're like
10706960	10711280	three all right uh Shane I gotta let you go to get some more calls you have
10711280	10716360	anything else you want to say mmm oh you should go download the rest of your
10716360	10719840	download content for Mass Effect 2 because the shadow brokers what I did
10719840	10725480	today that $10 one and it was amazing it was so so good right now except I spent
10725480	10729680	all my points on that pinball arcade game well go buy more points one more
10729680	10734960	problem solved holy crap I gotta let you go bye now bye bye all right one eight
10734960	10741280	seven seven game olr excuse me or username on skype is orange lounge radio
10741280	10745480	acidic vampire in our chat room says the actual romance scene is kind of dorky in
10745480	10751400	Mass Effect 3 but the after romance scene is quite touching bonds double o
10751400	10755880	six says enchanted arms for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 that has tons of guy on
10755880	10760240	guy action I vaguely remember that but I don't remember having tons I just
10760240	10762760	remember being one of the first but anyway we have more calls coming in so
10762760	10769080	let's get to them hi you're on orange launch radio who's this hello you're on
10769080	10776640	orange launch radio we can't hear you hello oh no I heard it it's click hello
10776640	10781040	wait did you hear me yes we do now hi yes damn mic switch gotta love those
10781040	10784880	zenocore from the OKC how you guys doing hey how you doing zenocore see I knew
10784880	10787320	you knew how to work your Skype it's had to be something like that all right
10787320	10792220	what's on your mind buddy and not much of it I purchased Arkham City finally
10792220	10796320	because I said screw it I'm not gonna get any DLC anyway and it's ruined
10796320	10799920	gaming for me now I can't play half the other games because it's not as
10799920	10804000	satisfying but I'm sitting knocked everything out of Barbara I can't play
10804000	10809560	Skyrim now because the combat sucks I can't play dragon aids I can't play half
10809560	10813000	the RPGs I got anymore because the combat just does nothing whatsoever
10813000	10816880	Arkham City is just that fucking good like it raised the bar that high that
10816880	10820780	now everything else sucks asylum is better than that I mean the only thing
10820780	10825840	that holds a candle to it as far as a RPG like environment I'm not counting
10825840	10829200	Mass Effect because it's a first-person shooter is mountain blade of all the
10829200	10833400	things that's the guts they got the most visceral hand-to-hand combat that I know
10833400	10837240	of in an RPG like setting and that's a conquest game so technically doesn't
10837240	10840840	even count and it's very disappointing to me is it just the combat that you
10840840	10844160	love about Arkham City or what is it about this game that makes it so great
10844160	10850000	it well I guess just the way it goes you actually feel like you're really whooping
10850000	10853800	ass I mean everybody knows this about Arkham City in Arkham Asylum anyway this
10853800	10858160	isn't new news but the fact that nobody else has done this in any other game yet
10858160	10865720	is freaking annoying to me I mean I finally upgraded my POS computer to
10865720	10869280	something that's near top of the line I play Arkham City and I can't play half
10869280	10874560	the other action action or RPG games on it because they all suck as far as that
10874560	10877840	it's all I'm doing is clicking the mouse at least in Batman you're somewhat
10877840	10882580	managing things and using multiple weapons all at once I mean you hell when
10882580	10885640	they did added that stuff with Catwoman's like holy shit this is fun as
10885640	10890040	hell just beating people to death little whip but it is it is really it's just
10890040	10894720	it's funny to hear you say how much it's just ruined everything else because it's
10894720	10900160	so good I know it man I never thought I'd be in this position so I just blew
10900160	10905400	almost a thousand bucks on this machine and I've gone back to playing like Space
10905400	10909040	Harrier 2 on the on the Sega emulator I got off of Steve and everything else
10909040	10913440	just because nothing after I start after about 10-15 minutes I got to put it down
10913440	10919460	because it's not as good as Arkham City or I look oh my god so what about the
10919460	10927280	rumors of Arkham world I'm not paying attention to those we'll see but that
10927280	10931580	combat engine is unique it's not gonna work in anything that's that large
10931580	10936620	because it's tied to together like the combat from like a way back when from
10936620	10940800	the game Oh knee when that first came out of ps2 that combat system was
10940800	10943760	amazing but the way they built it you couldn't do anything else with it there
10943760	10947280	is no multiplayer ready thing because the way they glued it together so I
10947280	10952320	think Arkham City and Arkham asylum that style of gameplay is gonna be stuck in
10952320	10958280	that have you checked out any of the DLC yet I'm not going to Robin Nightwing
10958280	10964520	whatever all I need is a big bad cat woman and I'm good that's interesting I
10964520	10967000	don't know why but I find that very interesting that even though you love
10967000	10970640	the game so much you're like man don't really need to do the DLC cuz like for
10970640	10974880	me like I I probably will have to play all that Mass Effect DLC at some point
10974880	10982600	just because I'm getting so into this you know Mass Effect DLC Jesus man what
10982600	10987480	a what a racket that was have you played the Mass Effect DLC and no because my
10987480	10993000	roomy he bought the game run it released and he was gonna ruin it for me so after
10993000	10997720	seeing what actually were rewards you get it's like beating Rygar but not
10997720	11001960	doing it in an old-school way the old-school Rygar ending was something
11001960	11005640	you got because you fucking earned it everybody can get to the ending in this
11005640	11009720	game and it's gonna be a piece of shit so why bother oh my god pay for it
11009720	11012920	that's a classic 8-bit game I really need to try and do start to finish like
11012920	11017440	your event yeah my car was two screens and one of them has some animation on
11017440	11021000	that's it but that game was so freaking hard you're glad to see that screen
11021000	11025680	because you do not not many people get to see it but seriously yes but uh and
11025680	11028720	then they're just gonna slap a patch top of Mass Effect 3 to explain the
11028720	11033000	explaining the ending apparently so they're not gonna actually make it to
11033000	11036400	where you actually steer the character in one of three directions without
11036400	11040560	making a single choice at the end which ruins the whole experience for me so
11040560	11045400	now they're not getting any my money for that series anyway all right any last
11045400	11048600	thoughts before we let you go tonight Xenocore yeah the dark Sakura let that
11048600	11052720	tussin soak in there girl remember put some water in it shake it up more
11052720	11056280	tussin tough it out all right now hopefully she's listening I hope she
11056280	11061880	heard that all right take care buddy later all right bye
11063200	11068640	1877 game olr username on Skype is orange lounge radio I guess we can try
11068640	11071640	and squeeze in one more call we're getting a lot of calls tonight so I'm
11071640	11078840	gonna really try and fit in one more call here before we say goodnight
11078840	11083060	meanwhile I need to read tweets I have I have been totally ignoring the
11083060	11087400	Twitter's at twitter.com slash olr but let me read some tweets for you right
11087400	11092200	now no I'll take a call then we'll do tweets be the last call tonight hi who's
11092200	11101600	this yeah hey Zaku what's up yeah me and uh Adam your Ron was you after the
11101600	11106960	column we all went to packs together hell we even room together nice how was
11106960	11114120	it how'd you enjoy PAX East it was uh was it was almost a almost the same as
11114120	11119560	um last year in terms of crowds like like Friday was just like the heaviest
11119560	11125440	day like just trying to try my luck in in watching these trailers or playing
11125440	11130840	some of these games there were like at least two two hours plus in line it
11130840	11135640	wasn't even worth it what I did do was just hit up most of the panel though
11135640	11140320	stuff like the harmonics panel on Saturday when they actually explained
11140320	11145920	the whole process is to how rock band blitz became actually got it gone about
11145920	11151920	like it actually started off as a prototype and you know within this was a
11151920	11156820	prototype that was done within the course of a at least three years even
11156820	11161680	though it didn't pick up full steam until that last summer so it basically
11161680	11167200	went through several iterations where you know it for example the they
11167200	11171680	actually they did a lot in terms of trying to figure out the proper controls
11171680	11178000	seeing that they they propose so many so many ideas and solutions that most of
11178000	11181480	them ended up failing until they found the one that worked which is basically
11181480	11188200	either the joystick using the the D pads and the buttons or the shoulders just to
11188200	11193040	just to hit both notes and then the whole notion of having whether or not to
11193040	11197440	make it just like like frequency and amplitude in terms of a shifting you
11197440	11201360	from one instrument to another automatically so it deviates from that
11201360	11207440	in the sense that you can just play any you could stick with one completely like
11207440	11211480	I tried it today and I was I was pretty much bouncing from one one track to the
11211480	11216640	other within the song so you know coupled with the fact that you could
11216640	11221160	just do mostly power-ups that you gain as you as you obviously hit more notes
11221160	11225000	then it just basically it's almost like audio surf but in the sense that
11225000	11231480	everything's structured more importantly everything is um it just said it's just
11231480	11236040	binary in the sense wait did they have to have audio surf too on the floor no
11236040	11241000	no no that wasn't there I'm pretty certain prime will probably that depends
11241000	11246760	if they the developers of get get themselves a booth for prime but back to
11246760	11251800	the point it's like like back in the days of amplitude it was pretty much the
11251800	11257520	same way but it's the fact that the songs themselves of rock are like a rock
11257520	11261680	nature where it's not like techno and this is one of the questions that was
11261680	11266960	brought up in the panel I guess they're there the rationale was in the it's
11266960	11272240	easier to just you know release a product in which on day one people who
11272240	11277840	have existing rock band users and consumers could just you know start
11277840	11281120	playing right away with their with their current with their current collection
11281120	11287320	whereas if they added things that normally wouldn't fit into a into that
11287320	11292800	rock band caliber like a techno trance on that was made you know that and made
11292800	11298000	frequency and amplitude pretty much a you know called classic then it would
11298000	11302360	just like folks have to start over from scratch let me let me try to get away
11302360	11305360	from the rock band stuff for a minute we've seen so much about it on the
11305360	11309200	internet what other panels did you get to all right the other all right other
11309200	11316400	ones I like let me see the Kotaku panel that was on Friday where everyone
11316400	11321280	everyone in that panel was taking it over for an hour so I just threw out one
11321280	11328400	little question in terms of a sort of like an inside thing in Kotaku if you
11328400	11332040	were like really in the in the site you would actually know like all their
11332040	11335800	sections like how they how they have their own blocks of stories they let
11335800	11340080	anyone have a panel they clearly are letting anyone have a panel so I want to
11340080	11345360	know our panel at PAX Prime yeah but that was that folks writing stories
11345360	11349920	within the hour and actually you know they actually they had a little work
11349920	11355640	actually air their grievances in terms of banning people or or or actually
11355640	11360360	taking pictures and so forth it was even live blogging that's productive open the
11360360	11364880	floor back up to the people dance on a website yeah I mean did they suck their
11364880	11371040	own dick in front of all you guys too no it's like they were just alright they
11371040	11375200	what happened was like the the editors or actually the former editor of Kotaku
11375200	11380360	was was spearheading the panel so the idea was that folks who just like pitch
11380360	11387700	their their story ideas and the audience the the audience would actually pick the
11387700	11393080	ones that that they would want to they would want to hear about and within that
11393080	11397920	hour they would have to actually produce it you know write an article for it did
11397920	11403800	they have a big on the site and did somebody judge people yeah the editors
11403800	11408080	obviously the editing team was pretty much making sure everything was there
11408080	11412400	all right no no disrespect but I could give two shits about the Kotaku panels
11412400	11417000	tell me about our other one all right the other one was caught the tail end of
11417000	11424600	the epic panel where cliffy be basically we're just going off on sir you know for
11424600	11429520	questions in the audience one of which was a you know a girl actually trolled
11429520	11434680	the whole panel is in saying that you know she wants to see Gears of War on
11434680	11439880	PlayStation 3 and to which cliffy replied he will if they fix the you know
11439880	11446520	they fix that god that weak rumble the ps3 controller and then she was promptly
11446520	11450760	arrested in the state of Arizona for trolling the panel all right but the
11450760	11456160	last one I caught was a was basically a classic arcade panel like you have no
11456160	11460780	interest in penny art you know packs they have they have an actual classic
11460780	11466560	arcade room like nothing but old arcade machines good I love that were the folks
11466560	11471240	from the from a cam the American classic arcade museum actually they ran the
11471240	11475520	panel with with a couple of developers who actually worked on the original like
11475520	11481880	the original older arcade titles one of which was a food fight and miss pac-man
11481880	11487640	and then the other the third one was he was a developer for a crew for the
11487640	11492280	cruising series as they were going through how back in the day they were
11492280	11498440	like they basically started off from their dorm dorm rooms at MIT to the
11498440	11502800	point where they they made they made mod kits for their for existing arcade
11502800	11507440	arcade cabs like one like one for missile command that actually extended
11507440	11512400	the gameplay but in the sense that you know you would get more revenue because
11512400	11515640	the the challenges would be harder you wouldn't be playing the same thing and
11515640	11519760	with your guy with a with a single quarter and sheer sheer skill could just
11519760	11524280	like stay there for hours on end so you know it gets to the point where they get
11524280	11528880	to buy Atari and then they get picked up and then they start creating this pac-man
11528880	11533760	and to the point where it leads up to the the crash we're running long here
11533760	11539880	Zaku let me let me just quickly ask you your favorite thing about the whole con
11539880	11545760	certain prizes swag it's just like a free shit I mean I think I played
11545760	11550240	battlefield 3 and a cop you know in a mini tournament and all I got was a 4
11550240	11555340	gig USB drive but it was just like not only that is the after party the the
11555340	11559760	curse party the curse is like a service site that hosts like all these forms
11559760	11563360	like including ones for Minecraft they had a killer party with like open bar
11563360	11568840	and everything and the whole works and that was yesterday and they're saying
11568840	11572280	me and Adam had had ourselves a kick-ass time all right Zaku I gotta let you go
11572280	11575040	but I'm glad you had a great time actually I'm a little jealous but I
11575040	11580260	guess I'm happy all right take care Zaku all right have a good one later some
11580260	11585760	things haven't changed all this coming out of people's MIT dorm rooms I I love
11585760	11589040	hearing the stories about the old game design though my god those guys really
11589040	11593160	loved what they did and it's just folks that were younger than you or I am now
11593160	11598440	you have designed these classic classic games all right I have to close up Skype
11598440	11602200	you guys we were running long now and I'm really sorry to those didn't get
11602200	11605760	through it was lit up tonight I still haven't even touched Twitter I've got to
11605760	11608840	quickly say we're running like so long so let me just read a few tweets here
11608840	11613160	Rhetortainment tweeted us saying Bank of America tried to foreclose on homes in

11660720	11664180	of Tiger Claus tweets here he always sends us some great tweets I need to cut
11664180	11667240	it a little short tonight but I will read this one because this is about a
11667240	11672360	company that we talked about a lot about here on the show Activision Blizzard has
11672360	11678080	been sued for patent infringement of virtual worlds usage due to World of
11678080	11684680	Warcraft and Call of Duty they're being sued by worlds Inc worlds Inc claims
11684680	11688400	that World of Warcraft and Call of Duty are violating the patent quote
11688400	11691760	technologies created by worlds have helped the business of virtual worlds
11691760	11695400	and gaming and the sale of virtual goods to grow into a multi-billion dollar
11695400	11700980	industry that was from worlds Inc CEO Tom Kidron while we are pleased to see
11700980	11704480	the gaming industry and is rapidly growing customer base of enthusiastically
11704480	11710200	embraced our patented technologies we deserve fair compensation for their use
11710200	11714400	this is the second time they've done this they filed suit against NC soft in
11714400	11719640	2008 for city of heroes it was dismissed after a undisclosed settlement was
11719640	11723520	obtained worlds Inc has been in business since either 99 or 2000 you know what I
11723520	11726600	don't know of them but to say they invented I've heard the name too but to
11726600	11729900	say they they're responsible for World of Warcraft and Call of Duty it's kind
11729900	11734520	of like dude I think copyright law online especially needs to be updated
11734520	11742160	because it's things have changed since the Revolutionary War just slightly ah
11742160	11747300	all right we got we gonna wrap it up we're running long tonight who knew that
