0	4480	You're listening to the podcast Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 454.
4480	7840	Before we get to tonight's show, we would like to start with an important announcement
7840	12000	that occurred during the taping of the Bobby Black Wolf Show the night of the recording.
12000	14800	Up first is that clip courtesy of the Bobby Black Wolf Show.
20640	28000	But right now, it is 6 p.m. on the West Coast, 9 p.m. on the East Coast, and I want to say hello
28000	32560	to all the OLR listeners that are coming in for OLR. I'm Bobby Black Wolf. I'm typically the opening act
33280	40000	here on Sunday nights. We typically don't talk meta that much about where we broadcast all that
40000	45600	often. We feel that those type of conversations are best kept off the airwaves and in private,
45600	51200	but indulge us for a few moments as we discuss some things here. All Games Radio has been our
51200	56880	home for a long time. I was actually the first broadcast on the network here almost seven years
56880	62560	ago. And OLR was actually our first affiliate to have a pre-recorded show, and then eventually I
62560	68800	was able to get them to move over to be broadcasting here on All Games. We've had a lot of great
68800	74800	experiences here with this network, from E3 Outpost to the Xbox Live GamerPix to PAX08 and
74800	80560	E4ALL on the live broadcast. Lots of great things have happened that I know I personally will
80560	85680	cherish for the rest of my life. And even though I was removed to station manager and site admin
85680	89840	several years ago, I've enjoyed the community and the stage that has been here. It's been my home
89840	96480	for one hour a week here on Sunday nights. There are changes coming to All Games Radio, and
97280	103360	they're changes I don't personally endorse. They're not necessarily bad, but they're not
103360	108720	ones I personally want to be a part of. And one of the other show hosts here on the network stated
108720	114400	that if all you wanted to do was just have a stage to do your own show and not attempt to help move
114400	120640	forward to make the network a better place, then you needed to get out of the way. So even though
120640	128560	I don't personally endorse the proposed changes, I don't wish to stand in the way of them. So tonight
128560	134160	right now I'm announcing that this right here is my final broadcast on All Games Radio.
137120	141760	Well, this might be a good time to mention that there is a reason we haven't hung up just yet.
141760	148000	You know, Orange Lawn Radio started as its own fully fleshed radio station in 2002 on Live 365,
148000	152560	and after five years we made a business decision in light of escalating costs to move to the All
152560	157360	Games Network. This arrangement, you know, as Bobby mentioned, it was really initiated and
157360	163360	championed for by Bobby. We've been absolutely honored to have Bobby. As he puts it in his words
163360	168720	as an opening act for the past five years, we view it a little differently, but without Bobby's
168720	174480	efforts it's very possible that OLR as we know it would have ended several years ago. You know,
174480	178960	change to All Games Radio is going to be a great thing for the station, but it's time to let you
178960	183760	all know that a plan was drafted some time ago that will require us in order to take Orange
183760	189920	Lawn Radio to the next level to leave the network as well. Tonight's upcoming episode, episode number
189920	197120	454, will be the last Orange Lawn Radio on the All Games Network. We've been fierce supporters
197120	203520	of independent podcasting and podcasters, and this is not and will not change. We remain supporters
203520	208640	and fans of the All Games Network, even though the future for Orange Lawn Radio will involve our show
208640	214720	being elsewhere. Out of respect to the other hosts and community at All Games Radio, we will not be
214720	219840	unveiling those plans here on their bandwidth. Stay tuned, you know where to find us. Yes,
219840	228000	the show will go on next week, and yes, Bobby is still the co-headliner. On my way out, there are
228000	234960	a couple people I do want to thank, first off being Orange Lawn Radio. They were my inspiration
234960	238880	to start podcasting. They were, I don't know if they were exactly the first podcast I downloaded,
238880	242960	but they were the first one I listened to religiously. Back in the to-go days, it's been
242960	248320	a great joy to be able to help them be a part of this community. I remember being so scared emailing
248320	254880	them the first time, and then now I get to talk to them every single week, pretty much. I got to go
254880	259760	to Disneyland with them and hang out with them. It's been an honor to work with them, and I look
259760	266080	forward to what we're going to be working towards here in the future. The community here at All
266080	271280	Games. We've had some good days, and we've had some bad days. People that are probably in the
271280	275360	community more often than just Sunday nights know what I'm talking about, but ultimately I will
275360	280960	remember a lot of the good stuff. The hardest part of this is that I will probably be leaving
280960	286640	the chat room where I've idled for almost a decade sometime this week, and it's going to be kind of
286640	295040	hard to say goodbye to that, but sometimes it's time to move on. Tiger Claw. You guys probably
295040	301520	don't realize this. If it was not for Tiger Claw, this stage that we have been on probably would
301520	306800	have collapsed a year ago. He is the man that has been keeping the light on for the rest of us,
307520	311440	because he's been kind of acting as station manager, and he has championed bringing in
312880	318080	other people, other podcasts to the community, and I'm sure that he's going to help keep the
318080	322640	light on for much, much longer. Thank you very much to Tiger Claw for everything.
322640	330240	Lastly, Scott Rubin. While Scott and I did not see eye-to-eye on everything,
331360	336240	and I might have actually felt that there were some unfair characterizations made of me back on
336240	342160	the All Games Interactive days, off the air he has been very supportive of me and wanted me to
342160	349600	succeed in everything that I wanted to accomplish. I am here to do this tonight because of him,
349600	355200	because of his advice, because of his support. Without Scott Rubin, there would be no Bobby
355200	360000	Blackwolf, literally as in he actually picked out that name. I didn't come up with that name,
360000	365600	Scott did. Just as Scott has moved on from All Games, he's doing high-profile live streams for
365600	372640	made-stream TV networks. It is time for me to move on from All Games, but I thank Scott for every
372640	377680	single opportunity that he has given me. All right, so we want to thank some people,
377680	383360	too, but our lists are probably very similar. First, Bobby Blackwolf, obviously, for all the
383360	388560	obvious things we've already stated. The other hosts at All Games Radio that work their asses
388560	393200	off to produce quality content for this network and promote the independent gaming community.
393200	401040	I personally have loved meeting all of you at the various events, the PAXes, the E3s, the Outpost,
401040	407040	so on. Unfortunately, not every show is really in the All Games network to promote the community,
407040	410880	but I'm not going to dwell on that. There's a lot that are very passionate about it.
410880	415040	You've been noticed, you've been appreciated, and I hope we can work with you in the future.
416080	419760	Although we don't want to name everyone specifically for fear of leaving someone out,
419760	424400	if there's one host we need to tip our hat to besides Bobby, it's our own personal pod
424400	428160	father and the man that taught us a lot about internet radio, Travis Donovan.
429360	433360	Specifically to the OL Army, if you're hearing this, you've stuck by us through every tough
433360	438240	decision we've made. You've supported us when we said we are no longer exclusively a Bimani show.
438240	443840	You supported our creative decision to end the live afterbirth segment of our show,
443840	447760	because it just wasn't striking our creative spark anymore. You supported us when we left
447760	452160	Live 365 to take our show to the next level, and we know you will support us as we leave
452160	456240	All Games Radio to take it to stage three. And I think this is a good time to reiterate,
456960	462720	we will be back next week, and you will be able to listen to us just as easy as you do now.
462720	468160	But out of respect towards the network, we're keeping that under our hat as to exactly how
468160	474560	that's going to happen for a few more days. Tigerclaw gets our thanks as well. All Games
474560	478560	would not be able to function right now without Tigerclaw. He's passionate about this network,
478560	484640	and every host on this network owes you a lot of thanks. Of course, Scott Rubin, although certainly
484640	489040	we've mentioned Bobby a bit in how we ended up at All Games, Scott was a crucial piece of this
489040	494480	as well. Although we give the mainstream gaming press a lot of shit on the show, Scott is someone
494480	499200	who lived it, left it, and built an online network that fit in his independent vision,
499200	505040	and we all have so much respect for that. So I know I've been monopolizing the conversation.
505040	508800	This is like the first time in probably five years I've read from a script, but I want to allow
508800	512800	Dark Soccer and Loki, because their OLR is just as much as me, to say anything they want to say
512800	517520	about this as well. I'd like to thank myself for being awesome. No, really, you said everything
517520	523200	that I could say, and Jesus has nothing to do with this. Thank you for letting us know. Loki,
523200	530720	anything? And I will still not be updating the radio app on PSP. OLR PSP.com will still stay
530720	537440	out of date. Some things shouldn't change. Some things have to stay the same. Bobby, it's all you.
538720	542320	Well, I think that this is the part where I'll be letting you guys go. I had to write my stuff
542320	549360	to a script too, so any last words here before I send everybody off? Don't cry. That goes for you,
549360	553920	and it goes for the listeners. It ain't over. We still have a show left. Stay tuned. We're still
553920	564080	having a show tonight. I know this is shocking, but this is how you have to start the future,
565120	569600	and good luck to everybody, and I really, really wish All Games the best of luck, and thank you so
569600	575440	much for having us for the past five years. Good luck. All right, Orange Lounge Radio is up next.
575440	580400	Thanks so much, guys. Thank you.
580400	586640	Orange Lounge Radio.
598240	605760	Tonight, April 22nd, 2012, Halo 4 has a release date. Nintendo announces new games for the 3DS,
605760	610320	and the upcoming enhanced Baldur's Gate won't be coming out for one particular system.
611760	614080	Orange Lounge Radio.
616000	621360	Heard any good jokes lately? Hi, everybody, and welcome back to another week of the show where
621360	626160	every gamer has a voice. Orange Lounge Radio. My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky.
626160	629360	Joining me as always, say hello to the one and only Dark Sakura, Jamie Sommers.
629360	629920	So full.
631120	632320	Full of poop.
632320	638080	No, I'm going back to my raw food, so I went out with a bang.
639200	641920	It's always some fad diet with you. It's not a fad.
641920	643760	Not fad diet, but it is always some diet.
643760	646080	I was really well, I was really happy as a vegan.
646080	648160	I think you're purdy just the way you are.
648160	650640	Well, I'm not doing this for purdy. I'm doing it for healthy.
650640	653920	All right, fine. Also say hello to Techmaster Loki.
653920	654320	Hi.
654320	656560	Who's still on his pizza diet, clearly.
656560	657360	It's not a diet.
658800	661120	Well, because that implies that I'm eating pizza all the time.
661120	663520	Well, Loki, don't worry. I think you're purdy just the way you are.
664240	664800	Really not.
666400	672880	All right. So anyhow, we're here. We're live. Live, as you'll hear on the podcast,
672880	677600	as our live listeners heard for the last time at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com,
677600	680880	right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern.
680880	685520	Join our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to chat live with us on this
685520	689760	lovely evening. What is the date today? I don't even know. April 22nd, 2012.
689760	691440	That's right. Cause my birthday was last week.
691440	695840	That's right. Happy darn birthday. Before we get into our gaming weeks, let's talk about,
695840	698880	we were gone last week. We didn't have a show. I know this was a whopper of a
698880	702560	night to come back to, but Hey, it's just how it went down. Um, Dark Sakura,
703360	705120	how was your birthday? What'd you end up doing?
705120	710640	Well, not really a whole bunch of stuff. I went to get delicious Indian food with you and Alan
710640	717200	and Pinkberry. And Dan took me to claim jumper where we split and I declare for dinner.
717200	724560	I felt so sick that night. He got me a really neat art book from 1944 that I've had my eye on.
724560	726640	It was neat. It's very cool.
726640	728160	Very old museum-y.
728160	733920	Well, on top of that, it was a lot of, because keep in mind this particular edition was fresh
734560	740320	right after World War II. And it had some of the really cool art movements that had occurred just
740320	746080	like 10 years before that. So for me as, as a designer, it was a real treat. And then, um,
746080	751040	you and Alan got me a sailor suit for my Duffy. So you can look at your Duffy bear and say,
751040	757520	Hey, Taylor. Yeah. Well, I love Duffy. You all know that. And you two are the only people who
757520	764160	got me presents. Oh, it's okay. I have everything else that I pretty much want. So it's all good.
764160	769040	Plus once you, once you get to a certain age, it's kind of hard to buy presents anymore.
769040	772160	No. When you get to a certain age, your presence costs 600 bucks.
772160	774880	You know what? I want money. I want money to pay the bills.
774880	778160	That would be a great, you know, it was like, it was like, when I was a kid, you'd get money,
778160	781680	go, what do I do with this? I have to have someone take me to places. And then that
781680	785280	means that my mom will know what I'm buying. Right. And then you get older. It's like money.
785280	791040	Give me more money. I can pay my bills. And video games cost $60, $60.
791040	794640	You know, that's how much I played for killer played, paid for killer instinct on this nest.
794640	797760	Yeah. I was gonna say, I guess, I guess to be fair, video games have always been kind of
797760	801920	expensive. I mean, street fighter two is a cartridge was what, 80 bucks?
801920	805200	We're not one of those are no mortal combat two or one of those, the ones,
805200	808880	you know what the most I've ever paid for a video game is? Um, actually I probably do.
808880	814320	Was it your Castlevania symphony of the night on, um, I've paid more. Okay. Well,
814320	817360	actually the Saturn one was like 20 bucks. Your game with the dish.
817360	824000	It would probably be a game. It was 280 bucks for king of fighters, 2000,
824000	827200	but Dan and I thought it was going to be the last one to come out. Little did we know the
827200	830880	summary showed on five would be the last one to come out, but Hey, we wanted to buy a brand
830880	836240	new Neo Geo game just to say we had, and we were in a different place then. But, um, but no, um,
836960	843520	I pretty much, you know, if there were like the only thing that I actually had on my want list,
843520	846880	you know, if you could call it that is an iPad and I'm waiting on that one. Cause I'm going
846880	854560	to Disneyland next month. Hello. So, you know, I can wait on that. I have my netbook. It works,
854560	861120	you know, it's, it's sort of like, like I'd said, you know, back during Hanukkah Christmas, Kwanzaa,
861760	867840	whatever holiday was politically correct statement here. I know. Um, I can't remember how
867840	877360	so is like, I've got tons of stuff. I don't really need anything and I've got tons of stuff to do.
877360	881600	You know, it's like, it's not like I can't just go and play mass effect that Rob loaned me.
881600	887360	I have no problem just going and playing mass effect that I bought myself. But anyway,
887920	896160	but you know, I've, I've got, I have great friends and I have a wonderful hubby who it sometimes can
896160	900800	be a jerk face, but for the most part is really cool. Uh, you're gonna make me sick. It's too much
900800	905120	emotion on this fucking network tonight. All right. But for the most part, like I said,
905120	912320	I've got everything I pretty much need, so I'm cool. I'm not, I'm not all gimme gimme anymore.
912320	914880	Let's go way to look at it. Although I do like the ABBA song.
916720	922480	Um, I was off last week cause I went to Disneyland for Jamie's birthday. Um, I went to the final
922480	925920	electronica. That was the whole reason because I am such a nerd. I had to go to the final
925920	929840	electronica. I've talked about it a million times on the show. I don't want to re explain it,
929840	934240	but you know, it was, it was really great to be there for the last show and everybody booing when
934240	938800	they pulled the plug. I'm a little disappointed that they just literally shut the lights off
938800	944320	on everybody. You know, grids down lol. Bye. Get out. Um, I got to see the Tron pinball machine,
944320	948320	but Flynn's arcade was so crowded because people knew it was the last night it would be operating.
948320	952960	You know, Dan's friend has one. Oh really? Has the deluxe edition too. I need his address.
952960	957360	Yeah. I'm going to go play. Uh, supposedly they're keeping the Tron pinball machine at Disneyland.
957360	962560	It'll be like the one Tron thing still left in the parks. Um, but it was, it was kind of a crowded
962560	967360	day. Um, so we didn't get to do a whole, whole lot, but electronica, but that's what we went for.
967360	971680	And I was happy. Um, I did the driving, so I didn't get to play a lot of games in the car.
971680	976800	Sadly, Loki, you, you guys have actually been out because you, you guys weren't on the last show
976800	980720	before the vacation, right? Cause that was the Jason and Alan show, right? Yeah. Cause it was
980720	985280	Easter. Yeah. How was your Easter? What have you been up to Loki personally? Not much. Just
985280	993280	hanging around the house and took Josh over to my mom's house and did the egg hunt and stuff.
993280	997200	He didn't really care about that stuff though. He's probably not old enough yet. He's just like,
997200	1002720	Oh, Hey, there's some of my treats are in this egg. I'm done. I just want to eat this one. He's
1002720	1006960	the one they have the attention span of a, you know, Labrador puppy. Is he old enough to
1006960	1012080	appreciate the greatness of peeps? No, he can't have peeps cause they're choking hazard. Oh,
1012080	1016000	darn marshmallows. Oh man. I'd be a terrible parent. I don't even think about that stuff.
1018240	1025120	That's why I have my wife. She, she thinks of that stuff. Um, no, I I've been doing other,
1025120	1032000	other things like playing games, lots of games. Well, lots of a game. Well then let's talk about
1032000	1034880	our gaming weeks. Cause we usually like to start off the show talking about what type of video
1034880	1039280	games we have been playing this week. Um, so dark soccer, what video games have been in your world
1039280	1045280	this week? Well, um, not so much actually playing, but we've been doing play through watching lately.
1045280	1049520	Dan and I have. That's fair. So we watched the play through of summary showdown because
1049520	1054880	my friend Gary had never, he, he didn't even know about the game and we're like,
1054880	1059360	what planet are you on and how are we letting you in our house? We're fixing this right now.
1059360	1064800	Exactly. And like we were even explaining like, uh, you know, some of the bad translation in it,
1064800	1069920	some of the English, which was funny, like, uh, how about we were calling, um, a box, a,
1069920	1076240	a happy funster and, uh, you know, just showing how you like, you know, even talking about,
1076240	1080240	cause a lot of the characters in the game are based on historical and cultural fictional
1080240	1085040	characters. So we were like trying to explain, you know, it was pretty cool. And then, um,
1085920	1090000	today we're actually watching a play through of Kanoa. So that's why I said my next cat's name
1090000	1095520	is going to be Kanoa and I'm going to get a rat named Hupao just cause it's fun to say Hupao.
1096400	1103360	And, um, I actually, you know, it's, I've got a new job, so I've, and since I'm also in school
1103360	1108240	full time and still have all of the graphic design projects that I took on while I wasn't working,
1108960	1114080	I have been a busy bee. So I haven't really had that much time to sit and really play
1114080	1121440	through anything. I haven't even had time to play much. Wow. Which, Oh my gosh, I've done like two
1121440	1126320	dungeons all week. And then one of them was so failed that I quit halfway through. I hate that.
1126320	1130800	And then it like just, just derails your spirit for the game for a whole week. I know it was like,
1130800	1135040	Oh, screw these people. Why are horde players so stupid? One of my friends was telling me today
1135040	1139840	about how final fantasy 13, two did that to him. Like he was running around for literally like
1139840	1144560	three hours trying to figure out what to do and realized he was in the wrong time thing. They went
1144560	1149200	to the wrong part of the story. And he was supposed to be in a chocobo that jumps and,
1149200	1153920	you know, just, just dumb shit. Now you know how I feel in my Kingdom Hearts 2 game glitched
1153920	1158800	when I skipped a planet and couldn't go back. I actually skipped all of Agrabah.
1160960	1164960	Going to our chat room at chat.orangelaundry.com break man is in there saying sky doesn't have
1164960	1170320	children or pets for their safety. Actually, I am the wicked stepfather to two kitties.
1171200	1176880	My other half Alan, when we moved in together, he brought old kitties. They're, they're 12 years
1176880	1183840	old this month, I believe. So they're, they're getting old. They're Medicare kitties, but they're
1183840	1189440	still cute as hell. Yeah. And sometimes Sanrio will let me pet her. Yeah. Maruko is really an
1189440	1194320	attention whore. Like all I have to do, like I go into bed, lie down, get my DS open. Like I'm
1194320	1201040	going to play DSRB on my iPhone and like within minutes and he jumps up on the bed and he doesn't
1201040	1205920	just like get on my feet like some cats do or get on my chest or whatever. He gets up in my face.
1205920	1210480	Like I am here, bitch. Pet me right now. I told you what Shermie used to do when we had our bed
1210480	1215600	on the floor. She used to crawl in under the sheets in the middle of it. Cause Dan and I use,
1215600	1220000	we have separate blankets cause we're both sheet hogs. So we just use our own blankets and
1220000	1224640	Shermie would crawl under and then put her head on my shoulder and just start purring away and
1224640	1230240	sleep on my shoulder in the morning. That's cute. And usually just meant get up bitch and feed me.
1231680	1238720	All right. Anything else for your gaming week? Um, no. All right. My gaming week. Um, actually
1238720	1242800	not a whole lot because I've been focused on one game. What did you want to say,
1242800	1249600	Jamie? You thought of something, didn't you? Damn stupid panda shit. Not installing. Fuck you,
1249600	1254160	Blizzard. Fuck you. Oh yeah. You got in the wow beta and it won't work. Yeah. And I left my hard
1254160	1257600	drive at home and I was going to copy your files. I would say something about, well, this is why
1257600	1261360	they call it a beta, but I don't want to get actually, I have a four gig flash drive. You can
1261360	1265040	use that guy. You can borrow that guy over there. I have a one terabyte hard drive just sitting
1265040	1270320	there. I've got flash drive on me. All right. Anyhow. But my thought is because I've moved,
1270320	1277760	um, my wow folder in full before I figured what I might be able to do is copy your installs and
1277760	1282320	have them update on my computer. All right. Just don't copy the porn. All right. I downloaded
1282320	1287760	the porn. It was funny. You really want to tell them why not? Cause it's hilarious. And keep in
1287760	1291760	mind I didn't watch the whole thing just because it was so stupid, but it was a Mork and Mindy
1291760	1298320	parody. I was so morbidly curious that I watched it. The question of the hour is,
1298320	1304240	did it have the theme music? I just kept fast forwarding through the whole thing. The guy
1304240	1309600	say nanu nanu. Yes he did. The very last thing, you know, after he does his splooge business is
1309600	1315040	your nanu nanu and then it fades to the credits. I was like, my childhood has just been raped.
1316240	1321840	This porn wasn't from the seventies. It was from like last year. It was done this year. Oh my God.
1321840	1326720	And it's called Mork and Mindy, the dream zone parody. And it's like hideous and awful,
1326720	1332000	but the girl does look a lot like Pam Dauber and the guy that played Mork actually does a very
1332000	1337440	good cracked out Robin Williams impression. I realized there's change in all we've been
1337440	1341280	talking about tonight, but last I checked, we weren't going to become a porn show.
1341280	1345200	Oh, I just had to get that out. Cause it was, it was funny. All right. Let me talk about my
1345200	1349120	gaming week. It's really been one game. It's still Mass Effect 2, but I did go through all
1349120	1355360	the DLC this week. I said, because I realize I am right at the very end. And if I do the next
1355360	1360640	mission, I set off a sequence of events where I won't get the best ending unless I play it
1360640	1364160	to completion. People who have played the game will know what I'm talking about. And Alan Kluby,
1364160	1368560	Alan's like a step ahead of me. And he said, whoa, whoa, whoa, don't do that mission until you are
1368560	1373520	absolutely ready to finish the game. So I said, all right. So I did every side quest. I did
1373520	1377840	Overlord. I did Arrival. I did Shadow Broker. I played all of it. Did your rival enjoy it?
1378400	1384240	I'm kind of mad at myself for giving EA that much money, but damn, it was good. Especially of no,
1384240	1388960	I think my favorite out of all the DLC was Arrival. And the reason why I think I preferred
1388960	1392400	that one, I mean, Shadow Broker had a lot of cool stuff to it and there was a lot of great scenes.
1392400	1397360	I realized that's kind of commonly people's favorites. The reason why I really loved Arrival
1397360	1401600	was Arrival really felt like an episode of a fricking science fiction show, like Battlestar
1401600	1406800	Galactica or something. Like I am playing an episode of a show, watching it play out.
1406800	1413120	It has its very cliche twists partway through a good beginning, middle end. I mean, it plays out
1413120	1418960	like an episode of a TV show. And I kind of wish as much as I'm kind of on DLC, like this is
1418960	1425760	something I really like seeing in games is this like really true episodic content. So, um, you
1425760	1430480	know, I can support DLC when it's, it's pretty awesome. Like that, that was my favorite by far
1430480	1434880	was Arrival. Um, and Shadow Broker kind of felt the same way too. I realized it kind of plays in
1434880	1440160	a lot more to the greater story. Um, and I think Arrival in some regards is supposed to tie it.
1440160	1444480	It's kind of to bridge two and three together, which I get, but it still felt a lot like a
1444480	1449520	standalone to me. I will have beaten that game by this time tomorrow. I'm, uh, pretty close. And
1449520	1455840	then thanks to the, uh, sale on Mass Effect 3 this week, I have my copy of Mass Effect 3 sitting in
1455840	1461120	the shrink wrap ready to go. So I can be really disappointed at the ending, just like everybody
1461120	1467600	else, but the experience and the, what, probably 25 hours in Mass Effect 1 and at 35 so far in
1467600	1473120	Mass Effect 2 plus whatever I spend there will at least be worth it. Loki, how about your gaming
1473120	1483760	week? Um, well, I, I started playing some more stuff on my PS3. Um, basically, uh, infamous.
1483760	1489440	I finally played a little bit of that and it's, it's okay. It looks old and seeing not even that
1489440	1494880	old, but it just, I don't know. It's, it's all right. I may, I may finish it. Unfortunately,
1494880	1499440	all my time is being taken up by Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3. He has finally jumped on that
1499440	1506000	bandwagon. Um, after playing, you know, Modern Warfare 1 for a long time, uh, well, it seems
1506000	1512000	like a long time, but a few months, uh, we decided to go ahead and make the shift to Modern Warfare
1512000	1517760	3 and it's pretty awesome. I, I enjoy it and playing pretty much just all multiplayer because,
1517760	1522800	uh, the campaign, I can never really sit down and play that for long enough, but, um, I'm enjoying
1522800	1527840	it. I like the fact that first off the game still supports System Link, which is great because
1529440	1535040	our internet kind of sucks at my work. Ironically enough, it fixed itself when we had a power outage.
1535040	1538720	All it took was shutting something off and turning it back on. You know, the old, uh,
1539520	1546960	IT standby and yet someone calling Comcast tech support. Well, did you try power cycling? I love
1546960	1551040	how it's called power cycling. Did you power cycle? Like it's like fucking something out of
1551040	1556000	Tron. Did you power cycle the cable modem? Oh, just hit that big switch that says power. Yeah.
1556000	1563280	So now count to 10 slowly with me. One, two, three. Okay. Now turn it back. So instead of like,
1563280	1568480	um, we have, instead of us having no connection to Xbox live, we still have a shitty connection
1568480	1571840	to Xbox live, which I guess the shade connection is better than no connection, but we're playing
1571840	1576240	System Links. It doesn't matter. Um, but I, I like the fact that not only do they have System Link,
1576240	1582400	but they have the same type of leveling that you would do online, but offline. So you can
1582400	1588720	actually level up your custom classes and stuff like that offline. So if you're like us that only
1588720	1593200	play offline, it's kind of cool because you have your own stuff that you can level up. Now,
1593200	1599120	granted that stuff doesn't transfer online, but you can still level up offline and you know,
1599120	1603280	it's kind of fun. It gives us more of a reason to play the game. Um, so I like the fact that
1603280	1608880	they added that cause they really didn't have to do that. Um, which is nice. I wish Grand Theft Auto
1608880	1614160	5 did that because I just wish that that has System Link cause that'll be worth it. But actually
1614160	1619040	I picked up the game on, um, on PS3 and on 360. So I have it on both platforms. I actually play
1619040	1624960	with some of my coworkers on PS3. I'm actually, well I play online, um, on PS3. I haven't played
1624960	1631840	online with my 360 yet, but, um, I may, you know. I guess that means I have to create an elite
1631840	1638800	clan. So we'll do the OLR army. All right. Get the OLR army. Yeah. Awesome. All right. Well,
1638800	1643520	I guess that wraps it up for our gaming weeks. So we will get into some news here shortly. Um,
1643520	1648800	first off, we usually do housekeeping. Um, I think we said the pretty big part that we were, um,
1648800	1653840	waiting to say. Uh, so we'll, uh, we'll talk about that later in the show if you want. We're
1653840	1657520	going to do Ask Orange Lounge tonight in part B, um, cause we haven't done that in a long time.
1657520	1661760	We didn't do a FUGL question this week. So, uh, Ask Orange Lounge will come up in part B. So we'll
1661760	1665360	let you know when to submit questions, um, on anything, any topic that we figured it would be a
1665360	1672080	good, a good segment, um, for our last show here at All Games. Um, also, uh, I do want to say,
1672080	1676720	of course, as always, since we are on Facebook, we are on Google Plus at us facebook.com slash
1676720	1683280	orange lounge, uh, and also Google Plus, just look for orange lounge radio, twitter.com slash OLR.
1683840	1687120	All right. Let's get into some gaming news. Loki, you want to start us off with the news
1687120	1693280	this week? All right. So it's Nintendo, Nintendo, Nintendo, lots of announcements for Nintendo. Um,
1694000	1698240	first, let's start off with some stuff that they're talking about E3. Um, of course, E3 is
1698240	1702880	just right around the corner, only a couple months away. And, um, you know, Nintendo's promised a few
1702880	1708080	things that they're going to show. First off, they're showing a Wii U Mario game. Not a big
1708080	1714880	surprise because they kind of showed off a Wii U Mario game last year with the E3. They had like
1714880	1720640	a tech demo and that's actually what's going to be based on. It's based on that kind of new Super
1720640	1729920	Mario Brothers with Miis. Um, and that's cool and all, but I mean, I don't know. Is that really a
1729920	1735040	step up? Do I really need a Wii U for that? I mean, cause you're just giving me the game that
1735040	1742560	you had last year or was it last year? I don't know. Recently on the Wii, but now you're adding,
1742560	1749280	you know, Mii support. I mean, something that on a modern console, you know, ones that have updates
1749280	1756080	to their games, um, you could just patch in, you know, and instead of releasing a whole new game
1756080	1759280	for it, but I thought for some reason you could already do the Miis and the Wii game that was out.
1759280	1765440	I don't know why I thought that, but, but I mean, okay, at least it'll be HD and native
1765440	1769680	widescreen support or whatever. Um, there's gotta be another catch. There's gotta be something
1769680	1774480	they're not saying there. I cannot believe, especially if this ends up being a launch
1774480	1779040	title, which we don't really know. I'm assuming it's a launch window title. It's a lot of 3DS.
1779040	1784320	I think it could be a launch title, especially if it's based off new Super Mario Brothers Wii.
1784320	1787520	That's true. They've got to be rushing something. I think they're going to learn from the mistake
1787520	1792560	of the 3DS and they're going to have a AAA something out. So it's probably, you're probably
1792560	1797360	right. It's probably Mario, but I'm, I'm curious what the little gimmick is going to be, you know,
1797360	1803760	cause how could Nintendo put out a launch title for the Wii U and not somehow integrate the whole
1803760	1810080	screen in your lap concept? Like, I think it'll be something derpy. Like when you go in a pipe,
1810080	1814560	you're on your screen and your other partners are still out there in the world. And then,
1814560	1818800	you know, watch, it'll be something silly. Who, who like that?
1820640	1827280	I mean, I have an idea what this is already, but we're not covering that until later. So
1827280	1831040	I just think, I think it's a port of a game that's coming to another platform that they're
1831040	1836400	going to do some things that it, that other game may integrate with the Wii U since it has two
1836400	1840880	screens. All right. I can see where you're going with this. Anybody who's been paying attention
1840880	1846000	to the news this week knows, otherwise we'll get to it in a minute. Yeah. So, um, I don't know.
1846000	1853840	Um, besides, uh, Wii U, Mario, they're promising that they're going to reveal Pikmin. Um,
1853840	1858960	and I'm assuming it's for the Wii U. It might not be, it could be for the 3DS, but that there's
1858960	1864400	going to be a new Pikmin game. However, I think, remember, um, there's, you know, Miyamoto talking
1864400	1871120	about Pikmin game a while ago, but just nothing ever came out from it. So, I don't know. Cool
1871120	1878000	that there's going to be a new Pikmin game. Um, I don't really know what, I don't know. I guess
1878000	1884240	we'll find out what it's about, but I'm not excited about Pikmin. I, I, I couldn't really.
1884240	1888560	Some of those series I just kind of missed because I was never really, you know, I didn't get into
1888560	1894800	the, it wasn't the first one on the 64. Was it a GameCube? I think they're both GameCube. I just
1894800	1899200	missed the boat on Pikmin. I understand people really love it, but, um, it's one of the series
1899200	1904480	I never got to play. I was too busy with F-Zero. Let's put it that way. That'd be cool if they
1904480	1909120	announced an F-Zero game for the Wii U. Don't tease me. Well, moving on, if you're not a Nintendo
1909120	1914240	fan, maybe you're more of a Microsoft person and you will be excited by the news of Halo 4.
1914880	1920320	Or maybe not. Some people aren't happy with the whole, like, Halo is still continuing without
1920320	1925440	Bungie. It's, you know, but, you know, these things are gonna happen. Uh, Microsoft did announce
1925440	1933200	that Halo 4 is going to launch worldwide Tuesday, November 6th. Um, funny that they did the whole,
1933200	1938320	uh, integration with Conan O'Brien. Like, they, there was a long segment on the Conan show on TBS,
1938320	1943200	like, nine minutes, kind of, about Halo and some funny voice, like, they were, you know,
1943200	1947120	the background guys doing moving or something. That was a little silly. I think it's in the
1947120	1952320	game. I do too. I mean, it was very red versus blue to me, but it was cool because it was Conan
1952320	1958160	and Andy Richter who are both awesome. Um, so of course there's the whole little corporate speak of,
1958160	1962880	with Halo 4 leading the charge, we're confident 2012 will be the most successful year in Xbox
1962880	1969440	history. Uh, we are beginning a new saga with Halo 4 and embarking on a journey that will encompass
1969440	1975840	the next decade of Halo games and experiences. Confirmed, Halo 4, 5, and 6. Right there.
1976480	1983280	Confirmed. And 7, and 8, and 9. Of course, to be fair, they already said in a while,
1983280	1987200	this Halo 4 will be the first game in a new trilogy. So it really, as much as I'm,
1987200	1990400	you know, being sarcastic, it really isn't in the news. Honestly, I don't see a problem with
1990400	1994320	the new Halo game coming out without Bungie. Yeah, I understand that Bungie was, you know,
1994320	1998960	kind of the driving force behind the last set of games, because obviously they're the
1998960	2005120	kind of creators of it. But, I mean, look at Call of Duty. I mean, perfect example. I mean, I know
2005120	2010400	Infinity Ward kind of was behind some of the really big Call of Duty games, and yeah, I could
2010400	2014480	see that even though Infinity Ward, you know, I mean, in name there's still Infinity Ward,
2014480	2019360	but, you know, most of the talent's kind of gone. Um, or the original talent, I guess,
2019360	2026720	they're still talented people there. But, um, it hasn't hurt sales at all. So I don't think that
2026720	2030720	the fact that Halo 4 is going to come from a different studio, that there's going to be any
2030720	2035360	less quality in the game. I think, if anything, it could be just like kind of fresh eyes on it,
2035360	2041200	I guess. It looks cool, just like the brief little snippets of things that they have on there.
2041200	2045760	I'd be curious to at least check it out. I've kind of stopped with the Halo series since Halo 3. I
2045760	2049840	haven't cared about all the other little Halo games that have come out, but I'm, you know,
2049840	2054160	I'm pretty shitty at first-person shooters, but I'm good enough at Mass Effect where suddenly
2054160	2058080	my ego's like, maybe I can play first-person shooters again, even though Halo doesn't have
2058080	2064400	a throw. Um, uh, some of our chatters, actdeftachat.org, says, I'm an Xbox person,
2064400	2070640	I'm not excited about Halo at all. Gamergirl says, Halo is overplayed, just saying. Porkchop says,
2070640	2076160	Halo needs a kick to the crotch. One way to kill Master Chef, and Chef is not a typo.
2077040	2081760	I was like, surely he meant to say Chief. Uh, Technus says, I like Halo. It's not the shit
2081760	2086400	everybody wants to believe it is. Oh, it's not, it's not the shit. I think that means like, yeah,
2086400	2090400	you're the shit. It's not the shit everybody wants to believe it is, but I won't knock it. I think
2090400	2095840	that's kind of how I feel about Halo. Like, I'm not going to like, oh my God, melt fanboy Halo,
2095840	2100480	but it's a decent series. There's a reason why it propelled the Xbox the way it did. It was a
2100480	2104480	great first person shooter, especially on the original Xbox. And it still is. I mean, and what,
2105600	2109440	I mean, I don't think that they're doing another Gears of War game. Well, I'm sure
2109440	2115200	they'll find a way. They'll find a way, but supposedly Gears of War is really, really dead
2115200	2119600	and ain't coming back. Now, here's one other thing I want to say about this before we go on
2119600	2124800	to the next story. November 6th is the day that the game is coming out. The first Tuesday of
2124800	2134960	November. Is there anything else really big every four years, especially that people might kind of
2134960	2140400	be caring about this year? A lot of passion around it has nothing to do with video games.
2140400	2145440	I don't think Call of Duty comes out that day. No, no. It's called election day here in the US.
2145440	2150160	That's right. It's election day. We have this guy, the president. You ever heard the name
2150160	2155200	Barack Obama? Yeah, Barack Obama. I don't listen to that hip hop music. OK,
2158160	2164720	well, it's it's it's the leader of our country. And, you know, that's a pretty amazing title
2164720	2170320	for a hip hop artist. He has to run for office again because there's somebody else named Mitt
2170320	2176320	Romney that thinks he shouldn't be president. That's a terrible hip hop name. All right,
2176320	2181280	movie. Look, it's not a politics show and it's not a porn show. Just an interesting observation.
2181280	2186080	But I guess Microsoft got called on it and it was very light. You know,
2186080	2188560	the statement they kind of released was like, well,
2188560	2192400	we think a lot of people will be excited about both, you know, whatever.
2193040	2197920	Right. Yes. Let us hold our release of our game so you can have your little election
2197920	2203680	or we can just move on like the rest of the world is. Let's be real. In this day and age,
2203680	2208240	you can vote absentee and Amazon delivers to your door. There you go. You don't have to
2208240	2213760	leave the house to participate in democracy or fragging online. I mean, absentee voting
2213760	2218160	takes like a few minutes. I'd like to vote in person. I personally don't vote. How about
2218160	2227040	putting those voting booths inside GameStop or no. Or or another retailer. All right,
2227040	2232880	mall. That would actually be a really good idea. You think get more young voters go to
2232880	2237600	Claire's then go vote? Why not? They should have they should have them at the mall.
2237600	2241600	Jamba man, free smoothie with your vote. I could get a Cinnabon while I vote.
2242400	2245600	See, that's a lot better than going to the Lutheran Church around the corner from my
2245600	2251040	house. That is true. I do feel like I have to go to the grade school to vote here and I don't have
2251040	2255920	kids. So I feel really awkward going to make you sit down at the really small desk. You have to go
2255920	2260720	in the library and I'm like, I'm a big person in the library. I'm hitting my head on the ceiling.
2260720	2265760	Yeah, I don't know. It feels awkward. Like like guys like me aren't supposed to be hanging around
2265760	2270720	elementary schools unless I have kids and I don't. So what's my excuse? And again, I have to go to
2270720	2274800	the Lutheran Church to drop mine off. So I think I'm going to burst into flames or something.
2275760	2280320	You get to vote, then you get some Kool-Aid. All right. Moving on. Moving on. Dark Sakura,
2280880	2286720	take us to a new story. Well, for those of us who are blessed with iPhones, we have a great game
2286720	2290400	coming up for iOS, although I have no idea how the fuck we're going to play it. I'm sorry. Can
2290400	2295440	I read some great chat comments real quick? Um, Infinel, I love this comment in chat room.
2295440	2300800	If corporations are people, can I vote Valve for president? Game Guru says, can I vote for
2300800	2304960	Master Chief as my president? Good, good way to tie the stories together. Appreciate that. Well,
2304960	2309360	you know who I usually write in? Bill the Cat. I've been doing this show with you for 10 years.
2309360	2314880	I know Bill the Cat very well. Why don't they just call, you know, Obama Master Chief,
2314880	2319600	you know what I mean? Cause it's, I would call him my Master Chief. He is, he is Master in Chief.
2319600	2324240	What do they call it? Chief. Here's how you win this. You put Obama in your fucking campaign.
2324240	2328160	Obama comes in, you know, dressed up like Master Chief, kicks down a door,
2328160	2332720	pulls off his helmet and said, go vote. And that'll get people in there. That's kind of how
2332720	2337600	the Bin Laden speech went down. But anyway, I don't remember him being in the Master Chief.
2337600	2341520	Oh wait, that was, that was when they made fun of him on late night. All right. No politics.
2341520	2345760	Moving on. So anyway, this awesome game I'm referring to is Marvel versus Capcom 2,
2345760	2352480	and it's going to be on iOS on April 25th. I've only got the British price, which is a £2.99,
2353200	2360480	but I'm assuming it's going to be a $5 game on, over in the US. I said, there's nothing yet
2360480	2366320	announced as an upgraded version for iPad and it doesn't show the virtual D-pad on the screen.
2367120	2373600	So, who knows exactly how it's going to control, but hey. The virtual D-pad is paid to unlock
2373600	2381200	content. On top of that, it has all 56 fighters from the, uh, original. That was nice of Capcom
2381200	2388000	to do for a change. You fucking know they thought about it. You know, there was that guy in the
2388000	2392960	boardroom. We could have, you know, eight characters that come with it. And then for 99
2392960	2400240	cents, do eight more and eight more. You know what? Meh. But for, for real Marvel versus Capcom
2400240	2408000	2 on the iPhone, if I had an iCade for the iPad, if I had, which I don't think is on tonight's
2408000	2414560	show, so I'll say it, that Midway game on the iOS devices, that Midway arcade treasures got support
2414560	2422240	for the iCade this week. Yes, very yes. Good idea. That helped that game immensely. So iCade support
2422240	2426640	for Marvel versus Capcom 2 would make it, you know, for those that don't own anything else,
2426640	2431440	I guess, so make it desirable. You know what I want iCade to make? I want them to make those
2431440	2437840	little miniature arcade cabinets like they had in the 80s. Yeah, so yeah, with the LEDs and everything.
2437840	2441280	Yeah, oh yeah. I want them to make like little cabinets like that. I should make one. I had a
2441280	2444400	friend of mine that had a Donkey Kong little LED game like that. I had a friend that had the pipe man.
2445840	2453680	You know, I actually have a Frogger cabinet like that, like one of the really small LED ones,
2453680	2458080	that I actually was going to convert into a MAME cabinet. I remember when you bought that. That was
2458080	2461920	your whole hundred dollar project, wasn't it? No, I didn't buy that. I actually got that free from a
2461920	2470080	co-worker. No, but I have the internals for it. I have a Pico ITX board and a tiny little LCD screen.
2470640	2474160	That would be awesome-tastic. The only problem is there's no room to put the controls on there
2474160	2480240	because you realize you're all, yeah, I can't really fit buttons on this thing. See, that's what
2480240	2485680	I was thinking, you know, Dan should do with his Transformer tablet because it's an Android
2485680	2492400	and you can get a MAME for Android is to set that up. But yeah, that's another story. Just don't buy
2492400	2498400	an iPad, I mean, for arcade games. Buy an arcade cabinet for arcade games. I mean, seriously,
2498960	2501840	you're going to be spending about the same amount of money. You might as well have the authentic.
2501840	2506080	That's true. That burger time I was looking at was $500. That's how much an iPad would cost.
2506080	2509360	Well, I wanted an iPad for stuff other than games and besides that it's not coming out,
2509360	2513040	this isn't coming out on iPad. Not like I don't already have like three other copies of it anyway,
2513760	2518880	but still. Gonna take you for a ride. All right, let's move on with some more news.
2520080	2526240	All right, so let's talk a little bit more Nintendo. And so there was this whole Nintendo
2526240	2532000	Direct little press conference thing that they did in Japan and they made some announcements.
2532000	2535200	First off, Animal Crossing is coming out this year on the 3DS. Well, it makes sense, you know,
2535200	2539600	they got to have a game coming out for the fall. And no one is surprised. Um, so it is coming out
2539600	2543760	in Japan. No word on the US, but probably coming out around the same time. I know you're very
2543760	2547920	cynical about Animal Crossing and you could give two shits about the improved park bench sitting
2547920	2552720	or whatever features they're actually adding into this one. However, I have a friend, a real person
2552720	2558720	that I know that said, holy shit, Animal Crossing is coming out. Time to get a 3DS. Shit you not.
2559360	2563520	Animal Crossing has its fans. They are loyal. I understand, you know, it's just like, you know,
2563520	2568880	Apple, I product fans were like, holy shit, Apple has a new thing coming out. I got to go get it.
2568880	2573120	I mean, it's just, it's just like this. I was just glad that she spoke to me in that
2573120	2580720	language for a change and didn't say, well, I hope that when she plays it, she discovers a
2580720	2585920	really makes a lot more sense in the Japanese version, a wholly unique experience and not,
2585920	2591040	you know, the same damn game again. Do you know, I found my cop, my Japanese Animal Crossing.
2591040	2597600	Okay. Since you brought up porn a long time ago, here's why this is funny because okay.
2597600	2601360	And the Japanese version of Animal Crossing, it's actually saying the little, little symbols
2601360	2605600	really fast. And because the way Japanese works, it's like the little animals are saying the word
2605600	2610080	it's a syllabic language, but because English is such a stupid language, all they can do is
2610080	2614560	say the letters really fast, you know? So they, they do say, they say like ABC, you have to,
2614560	2618720	you know, they're saying it really fast, but it's really funny because like, if you put in words,
2618720	2626720	like, fuck, you know, it's a little animal say it's really fun to put in dirty words and hear
2626720	2632400	how the little animals interpret them. Anyhow, sorry for dumbing down the show.
2634160	2639920	Okay. Um, they also announced that they're going to be doing a Kirby 20th anniversary edition on
2639920	2645520	the Wii. So if you're even mildly interested in it, I would recommend picking it up. Cause if
2645520	2650800	anything, you remember those Mario, at least this time, you're recommending this. You can't be right.
2650800	2655920	Look, Hey, no recommending this because of the resale value of the last Mario game. And
2655920	2661920	last Mario game was a stupid rom convert. It literally was a rom from the SMU. They're like,
2661920	2667840	Hey, we're going to just snap, you know, put this virtual console rom on that disc done.
2667840	2673200	No disrespect to the Kirby fans. It's a great franchise. However, you know, they did this with
2673200	2676880	Mario. They did it with Zelda back on the GameCube. It was a pre-order bonus only thing. So
2677520	2682720	it was basically virtual console on a disc. And now if they get some ones that we haven't seen
2682720	2687280	elsewhere out on there, it'll be kind of awesome. Yeah. It would be neat if they were, I don't know,
2687280	2690720	redone, but I think it's just a bunch of virtual console games. At least this time, it's not going
2690720	2695440	to be just one rom. Um, so that'd be kind of neat. Nowhere to when that's coming out,
2695440	2705360	but sometime he's here and Super Mario brothers, um, or new Super Mario brothers two is now coming,
2705360	2712160	uh, this August, both Japan and the U S and looks exactly like new Super Mario brothers one,
2713200	2722400	but with now Raccoon Mario. Hooray. Raccoon's awesome. Raccoon or Tanuki? Raccoon. Cool.
2722400	2726000	Maybe Tanuki. I thought the Tanuki suit was the most awesome. Actually, my favorite was the hammer
2726000	2730800	brother suit. I'm just glad though that they have stuck with the same backgrounds from the first
2730800	2737520	games so that, you know, Josh's room is still current because it's actually that, that looks
2737520	2742560	like Josh's room except different patterns of the mountains. Is it sad that it seriously took
2742560	2746640	me a minute because my first reaction when they announced the sequel was I was like,
2746640	2752720	Holy shit already. We just had Mario three D land last year. And then I was like, Oh wait,
2752720	2758320	it's not a sequel to the three D game. This is a sequel on the D three DS to the Wii game.
2759120	2764480	Like my brain actually had to go through those actually to the DS game that was on the DS. What
2764480	2768720	the hell was the Wii game then? The Wii game was kind of the same damn thing. Just new Super Mario
2768720	2774080	brothers. We noticed the Wii at the end. That was actually the first game that they didn't think
2774080	2779200	about getting a three DS confirmed. I don't understand Nintendo. Well, all you have to
2779200	2785680	understand is they took the game and they made some new levels and made some blinged out characters
2785680	2790960	because there's a level with all gold characters for some reason. Oh, and spider webs. That must
2790960	2796640	be new, right? I don't know. It's okay. By the way, I want to point out. Alan has paraded out
2796640	2801680	here just to hand me to do nothing, but he's, he hasn't even been sitting here. He's been sitting
2801680	2806640	in the back room playing mass effect. He walked out here specifically just to hand me the DS
2806640	2816240	cartridge of new Super Mario brothers as if to say here, dumb ass. Thank you, honey. Thank you.
2817360	2823760	Thank you. I learned so much being with you. I'm putting this up on our, on our page. So yeah,
2823760	2827440	new Super Mario brothers. It's kind of weird though that is coming out in August. I mean,
2828240	2831520	so that means that Nintendo does have something else that they're going to be releasing
2831520	2835840	for the fourth quarter. Oh, I know it's a new console. That's it. That's what they're releasing
2836400	2840240	that and probably animal crossing because animal crossing is somewhat cracky.
2842400	2846480	But yeah, anyways, as I was alluding to earlier, I believe that the Wii
2846480	2849360	Mario game that we've been putting out is going to be new Super Mario brothers
2850160	2856960	two for the Wii U and that you're going to be able to integrate or not integrate, but play the game
2856960	2861920	on your 3DS and on your console because the 3DS they will probably announce will actually be a
2861920	2870480	link up with your Wii U to do this type of cross game play stuff that they did on the Wii and the
2871920	2881200	Nintendo DS, but to a lesser extent because the Wii U, the controller looks like the bottom half
2881200	2887360	of a 3DS. Yep. Except the new 3DS that they probably will announce that we'll have two
2887360	2893280	analog six and not just one. Let's hope and no attachment later on, please. That would kind of
2893280	2897680	piss me off, especially if it's exclusive to GameStop. Quickie poll. What? Kuriboh Shoe or
2897680	2902640	Hammer Brothers Shoe. Um, Kuriboh Shoe all the way. That was like the raddest power up ever.
2902640	2908480	The Hammer Brothers Shoe sucks. It's Frog Mario. Actually, Frog Mario sucks too. Frog Mario is
2908480	2912640	balls unless you're in an underwater level. I will say that it is a challenge. I am very,
2912640	2917840	if somebody can beat the game with Frog Mario through the level eight worlds, color me impressed.
2917840	2921280	Frog Mario actually is very good in one of the level eight ones, the battleships.
2922240	2926320	One of them is like an underwater battleship or something, isn't it? You can, well, it's all
2926320	2930080	water, but you can, it's actually good for doing the high jumps over the, I'm just saying. We're
2930080	2936480	talking strategy for a 23 year old game. Just saying. All right. Kuriboh Shoe by the way,
2936480	2941280	all the way. Thank you. Nothing about light tromping some flowers. Why hasn't that made
2941280	2948080	it into Mario Kart as a power up? Just a big shoe that stomps. Exactly. Just like your cart turns
2948080	2954800	into the shoe. That's an awesome power up. Your cart turns into the shoe and it just flies ahead
2954800	2960320	and stomps on whoever's in front of you and you just take off from there. Oh my God. Nintendo
2960320	2968240	patent pending. Can't do it. Nintendo hire us. Hire us. Hire us. Hire us. Hire us.
2968240	2972560	It would be a cool idea. Confirm next week. Oh, LR on the Nintendo network. I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
2972560	2979920	Kidding. Put the hate mail down. Yeah. And then last thing, the 3DS is finally getting with
2980800	2985680	iOS and everybody else, you know, Hey, they figured up, you know, you might like to sort
2985680	2990720	your icons that you have. Um, so they're going to have a new addition to the home menu where
2990720	2997520	you can create folders and store up to 60 icons within each folder. So that is awesome. You can
2997520	3004960	actually kind of sort your games and whatnot. Neat. I like that idea. It's needed. That'll
3004960	3011200	become an April 25th. The things I don't play folder. Let's have that for all the little NES
3011200	3014080	games and the Game Boy Advance games I downloaded cause they were free and I don't play them.
3014080	3022960	There are some I do play, but some I don't. So anyhow, let's move on with some more news.
3022960	3027040	You know, there's a lot of great Nintendo happy-go-lucky news this week, but somebody
3027040	3034320	is not so happy-go-lucky about what's going on in Nintendo. And that would be Trent Oster. Who is
3034320	3039440	he? He's with Beamdog. And he went to Twitter this week to say Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition,
3039440	3044080	not coming to the Wii U. Ironically, I'd never would have thought that game was coming to the
3044080	3049120	Wii U. I, yeah, I'm like, I never would have put it, but you know, for whatever reason,
3049120	3055920	he was asked and he said, we don't do Nintendo development. Previous experience with Nintendo
3055920	3064400	was enough to ensure there will not be another Nintendo project. Oh no, he did. He just basically
3064400	3070960	said, worked with Nintendo before, not going to happen again. Apparently it has to do with MDK 2.
3070960	3075440	You remember MDK from back in the day, there was MDK 2. It was supposed to be WiiWare. There was a
3075440	3082400	6,000 unit sales requirement before the developer gets payment. I could see where that's kind of
3082400	3088080	crappy. Also had to do with trying to get a 400 meg game down to 40 megs with WiiWare. You know,
3088080	3092080	I can see where, you know, if you don't like the rules, then I'm going to take my ball and go
3092080	3098800	somewhere else and that's fine. They honestly need to like, you know, rethink their whole strategy
3098800	3104720	with their online games because they are a little bit restrictive and, you know, the exposure on
3104720	3110720	WiiWare isn't very good. Well, this whole Nintendo Direct before E3 is very interesting to me
3110720	3115680	because, you know, E3 is only, what, about six weeks away at this point? And for Nintendo to have
3115680	3119600	this kind of a major press conference before E3 is very interesting because these are games they
3119600	3123680	very easily could have kept in their hat until E3, with the exception of the firmware update. You
3123680	3128960	know, that's really the only thing that's happening now. I honestly, I mean, it's just like if they
3128960	3133760	came out and go, new Super Mario Brothers 2! I would have been like, told ya! I mean, it's
3133760	3137120	seriously, did they call it like last year? Oh hey, they're going to have a new Super Mario
3137120	3140880	Brothers game. Here's the thing though, here's what it is, because E3 is going to focus solely
3140880	3145200	on the Wii U. You know, again, no shock. That's Nintendo's big thing and that's the system
3145200	3149280	they're launching, so that's why they got all this 3DS stuff out of the way, so that they can
3149280	3153360	literally spend five minutes talking about 3DS and then the rest of the time talking about Wii U.
3153360	3157840	I think the launch with the Zelda game. I think that's going to be their launch game.
3157840	3161680	Really? I think this Mario game's it, buddy. I think that's your game.
3163520	3164000	If it is-
3164000	3166080	Zelda in 2013. Maybe.
3166080	3171840	Uh, the only reason I think Zelda, because Zelda would show off a new engine a lot better than
3171840	3176960	Mario would. Mario, you kind of are keeping it cartoony, and who gives a shit if it's an HD,
3176960	3182000	it's going to still look like a fucking Mario game. Whereas a Zelda game in HD looks a lot better.
3182000	3189200	Yeah. Well, um, also one thing I wanted to say is that one thing that Nintendo didn't detail here,
3189200	3194160	that they're going to have to detail at E3, is the Nintendo network. We still don't really know,
3194160	3197600	I mean, we've heard some little things about it, we don't really know what that entails.
3197600	3199600	And I think E3 is going to be a big reveal for that.
3199600	3200480	And they don't know either.
3202160	3203200	I wouldn't put it past them.
3203200	3209920	So hey guys, we have this poll on our website, we want you to vote on what exactly you want the
3209920	3211440	Nintendo network to be.
3211440	3216720	Brakeman in chat makes a pretty good point. Spoiler alert, Gears of War 4 also not going to be on the
3216720	3218400	Wii U. Sorry everyone.
3221280	3225920	That's true, and you probably won't see, you know, God of War coming to the Wii U anytime soon
3225920	3227600	either, you know, it's just the way these things work.
3228480	3230560	Halo 4, not on the Wii U.
3230560	3234320	Halo 4, not on the Wii U. That's right, not on the Wii U.
3234320	3237200	Not on the Wii U. Until there's, until there's,
3237840	3240960	someday one of them is going to gobble the other up. Just wait.
3241600	3245520	It's just like Sega. Who would have thought Sega would be publishing on an Nintendo platform?
3245520	3246080	That's right.
3247040	3251120	Minds were blown when Sonic showed up on the NES system. It was crazy.
3251760	3252320	I cried.
3253280	3254080	Aww.
3254080	3254560	Not really.
3255360	3256480	All right, moving on.
3256480	3260960	Dark Sakura. Well, Final Fantasy 14, they're desperate.
3260960	3265360	They really, really, really, really want everyone to come back.
3266160	3267440	They're just crying over it.
3268320	3273440	So basically, anyone who has an inactive Final Fantasy 14 account can come back for a 10-day
3273440	3275920	free trial next month, according to Squeenix.
3277680	3283440	They said it's going to be free of charge between the 10th and 21st of May with a new job system,
3283440	3290400	7th Umbral Era content, and new gameplay that has a new update.
3292720	3296160	And then for the people that are still playing, they're getting some goodies.
3296160	3303680	Anyone who's been subscribed for 90 days between January 6th and the 2.0 beta testing
3304560	3309840	gets their subscription released to, well this is in pounds because I'm reading off a British
3309840	3319440	article, to £6.89 down from £8.99. And they are legacy subscribers and they get a new Chocobo.
3320240	3320740	Ooh.
3322960	3328400	But they also, they were still cutting down on their servers, so they're desperate. Desperate!
3328400	3333280	The problem is though, who cares that they're offering a free, you know, come back and try us
3333280	3337840	for 10 days? Because it's not the 2.0 update yet! That doesn't happen until the fall! So why do I
3337840	3339520	want to play your half-finished game?
3339520	3346000	Well, to be fair, I mean I give Final Fantasy 14 its fair share of shit. I did play it,
3346000	3351040	I did play it for a while so I can speak as a former player, as someone who would be directly
3351040	3356560	impacted by this. They have put some things into the game already that were needed and that was
3357440	3363600	Final Fantasy classes that people understand, to put it lightly. Like now instead of Thaumaturge
3363600	3369920	and Conjurer, you can path to Black Mage and White Mage and you know, some of those changes
3369920	3376240	are actually pretty exciting. Not enough to get me back. Well, I should say, you know, if it's
3376240	3381600	going to be free for 10 days, if I'm not, what weekend is this happening again? I kind of shut
3381600	3382160	my brain off for a minute.
3382160	3389440	Crap. Let me look back at it. It says it is the 10th and 21st of May.
3389440	3393760	See, here's the problem. What's happening on the 15th of May?
3394720	3395360	Disneyland?
3396400	3398880	For you. What's happening on the 15th of May for everybody else?
3399760	3400800	Max Payne 3?
3400800	3402640	Diablo 3, people.
3402640	3403280	True.
3403280	3405360	Diablo 3 is on May 15th.
3406400	3406720	Why is this-
3406720	3410400	Do you think I give a shit about Final Fantasy 14 while I'm in the middle of Diablo 3?
3410400	3413600	Why does this make me think of like Cabela's and the Halo 3 launch?
3414160	3418480	So let's be real, there's really a four-day window to play Final Fantasy 14.
3418480	3419760	Just keeping it real, folks.
3421120	3423920	And so maybe if it's not-
3423920	3428480	Because, you know, if the patch is seven gigs, I have to think about,
3428480	3431840	oh, I have a 250 gig through Comcast and I got to download Diablo.
3431840	3433680	I hate that I have to fucking think about that, but I do.
3434320	3438560	So, you know, if it's reasonable, I'll check it out. Why not?
3438560	3439200	If it's free.
3440800	3442720	But I kind of don't think it's going to sway my opinion.
3443600	3447600	Porkchop in our chat room asks, does Final Fantasy 14 have much of a soundtrack?
3447600	3448960	Um, yeah, it's decent.
3448960	3453040	I believe Nobui Matsu did a large chunk of the tracks,
3453040	3456240	which is strange because he didn't really do Eleven's soundtrack at all, except the theme.
3456240	3457760	Just bring Eleven free-to-play.
3457760	3459280	That's all you need to do.
3459280	3460000	Right?
3460000	3462320	All you need is Eleven in the free-to-play, I'd be there.
3462320	3463760	I would be there today.
3463760	3465760	You know why Eleven can't go free-to-play?
3465760	3468320	It's the Japanese user base on PlayStation 2.
3468320	3470800	How can you have a free-to-play game on the PlayStation 2 at this point?
3471440	3471920	You can't.
3471920	3472640	Cut him out!
3474080	3475200	Okay, yeah.
3475200	3478160	No, seriously, how long is the PlayStation? Okay, fine.
3478160	3481120	The PlayStation 2 still has some game coming out.
3481120	3484560	To be fair, there's like five people on Xbox 360 too.
3484560	3485440	Let's not forget that.
3485440	3486240	That was a pretty big deal.
3486240	3487280	Oh, oh, yeah.
3487280	3491040	Let's, let's keep them up for the five people that play on Xbox 360.
3491040	3493680	Oh, but all those people play EA Sports MMA.
3493680	3494320	Fuck them.
3494320	3495280	Or Need for Speed.
3495280	3496480	Ah, fuck them too.
3496480	3497120	You know what?
3497120	3499440	All those five people there playing Final Fantasy.
3499440	3501200	Who gives a shit?
3501200	3501760	You know what?
3501760	3504160	Tell them, listen, go download the PC client for free,
3504160	3505520	because it's free to fucking play.
3506480	3506960	You know what?
3506960	3508320	Some people, though, do like that.
3508320	3511040	I mean, like, we have IKUMA right now saying that it's good now.
3512240	3516160	I mean, okay, if you have a PlayStation 2 and you're still playing on that game,
3516160	3517440	get a new PC.
3517440	3518320	I mean, come on.
3518320	3520560	A PC from, like, a few years.
3520560	3523760	Shit, you could probably get a PC from, like, what is it?
3523760	3526720	How long has it been since I've been playing Final Fantasy 11?
3526720	3527600	Like, 10 years?
3528400	3529200	It's been a while.
3529200	3530240	Okay, come on.
3530240	3533040	If you can't afford a PC from, like, 10 years ago,
3533040	3534400	what the-
3534400	3538480	It hasn't been 10 years, because, uh, this show is 10 years old,
3538480	3540080	and the Final Fantasy 11 thing started.
3540080	3540640	Okay, fine.
3540640	3541360	Like, a couple years ago.
3541360	3543680	Five to seven years ago, okay?
3543680	3544800	Five to seven years ago.
3544800	3547760	I literally am throwing away computers from that time.
3547760	3550160	I will give you a computer for free.
3550160	3552880	The computer that the show is broadcast from could play Final Fantasy 11.
3552880	3553920	Oh, I mean, the fuck?
3553920	3556480	There's probably this Vita could play Final Fantasy 11.
3556480	3557600	That was a rumor.
3557600	3558160	Remember?
3558160	3558800	That was a rumor.
3558800	3559920	They really knew to do that.
3559920	3560480	That was a rumor.
3560480	3561440	I would buy that.
3561440	3562560	I would buy that shit.
3562560	3563920	Well, maybe not on the Vita, because that'd be-
3564800	3566080	No, I'd still buy that.
3566080	3568320	But I'm telling you, Final Fantasy 11 would be awesome.
3568320	3569280	Who cares about 14?
3569280	3569840	Just listen.
3569840	3570960	Okay, it didn't work out.
3570960	3572000	We're gonna make it free to pl-
3572000	3574240	You know, to make it up, we're gonna-
3574240	3576960	We're gonna maybe revamp a little bit of Final Fantasy 11,
3576960	3577440	and make free to play.
3577440	3581680	There is too much pride for Square Enix,
3581680	3584160	the makers of Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy,
3585200	3588400	to say, we're gonna open this up free to play,
3588400	3591120	and have to take that big old slice of humble pie.
3591120	3592640	It ain't happening anytime soon.
3594960	3595200	I don't think-
3595200	3595920	I'll wait.
3595920	3599200	I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing for your MMO to take that path.
3599200	3601920	Why can't Final Fantasy go down the path of Guild Wars?
3601920	3603200	Anyway, forget it.
3603200	3604720	Because they're squeamics.
3604720	3605440	Let's move on.
3605440	3606400	They don't do that.
3606400	3610160	Let's talk about games that are really existing in a store near you very soon,
3610160	3612720	as we travel around the world and look at some release dates.
3612720	3613220	Yay!
3615120	3615600	All right.
3615600	3621360	So, this week, it's Prototype 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360,
3622640	3626000	and on 360, Phantom Breaker Special Edition.
3627760	3628240	That's it.
3628800	3629440	Oh, and-
3630480	3631120	No, that's it.
3631120	3631920	Shifting-
3632960	3634240	Shifting World on 3DS.
3634240	3635280	I didn't even have to look that shit up,
3635280	3636640	because there are three titles!
3636640	3637200	Three!
3637200	3638800	It's getting a little slower.
3638800	3640080	It'll pick back up during summer.
3640080	3641040	Yeah, I gave it a couple weeks.
3641920	3642560	How about Japan?
3642560	3644320	Let's check out Japan and see what's coming out of there.
3644320	3648080	On the 3DS this week, Shin Sangoku Musou Versus comes out.
3649120	3652640	That is pretty much the only big release, but that's coming out on the 26th.
3652640	3654480	I'm trying to figure out what this is.
3654480	3656160	This is a Koei game.
3656880	3660800	And I was trying to see if it was like Dynasty Warriors on the 3DS or something.
3660800	3661300	Yeah.
3661300	3661920	3DS.
3661920	3662720	Kind of what it looks like.
3663760	3664260	Yeah.
3664640	3666960	So, that is coming out on the 3DS.
3666960	3669680	Going to some of the other systems, checking out the Vita.
3669680	3680880	Vita has Seal No Surge, Ushinawatia Warita, sorry, Hoshi i Sasaguchi comes out this week
3680880	3688800	in Normal and Agent packs, as well as Next Revolution comes out for Media 5 this week.
3688800	3690160	Those are both on the Vita.
3691120	3693040	And checking out the consoles real quick.
3693040	3695040	Going to the PlayStation 3.
3695040	3697600	Biohazard Operation Raccoon City.
3697600	3702960	You get a special headset bundle for Operation Raccoon City, the game itself.
3702960	3703600	It's coming out.
3704240	3706320	And Loki's saying, don't fall for it, it sucks.
3706960	3711360	Also, what's very interesting, Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Game of the Year Edition,
3711920	3714160	finally coming out on PlayStation 3.
3714880	3717920	Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition, finally coming out on PlayStation 3.
3717920	3719040	Is that a new Idolmaster?
3719040	3720800	I think those are price reductions.
3720800	3725200	And yes, the Idolmaster Graver for You Volume 7.
3725200	3726960	I think this is more an expansion for Idolmaster.
3726960	3729440	I don't think it's an actual full on game.
3729440	3733440	I'm guessing that those are getting a price reduction because there was just recently
3733440	3739040	a combo pack with Fallout 3 and Oblivion for like $29.99 or something.
3739040	3740240	That could be here in the States.
3740240	3740560	Yeah.
3740560	3741040	That could be.
3741040	3743840	Well that wasn't $360, but I can see them dropping prices.
3743840	3746880	Oddly enough, $360 is pretty busy this week in Japan.
3746880	3749360	Operation Raccoon City Biohazard is out there as well.
3749360	3750000	Sucks.
3750000	3753360	Cybertroopers Virtual On Force gets the platinum reduction.
3753360	3754320	Yeah, I know, right?
3754320	3755920	Who knew Virtual On was still going?
3755920	3761520	I think that's the arcade game, plus they're throwing in the tournament stick or that arcade
3761520	3762480	stick that goes with it.
3762480	3763040	Need.
3763040	3767360	Dodonpachi Resurrection Black Label and It's a Cave Game is out this week.
3767360	3768240	That's probably a price reduction.
3768240	3769680	There's going to be a double pack.
3769680	3771200	Yeah, because it's called Cave Selection.
3772000	3775120	Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition also on the Xbox 360.
3775120	3776240	It's Dodonpachi.
3776240	3779280	The Dodonpachi Resurrection came out like, what, six months ago?
3779280	3779920	Yeah.
3779920	3783120	You saw the Akai Katana is coming out next month.
3783120	3783840	No, I missed that.
3783840	3787200	The new SHMUP or, yeah, it's a new SHMUP.
3787200	3790080	It's actually one that's actually formatted for widescreen.
3790080	3794320	The first cave game for widescreen HD TVs, all done in HD.
3794320	3795040	Well done.
3795600	3796400	About time.
3796400	3797600	And it's coming out in the States.
3799920	3800800	You know what?
3800800	3803040	There's actually a game that's in talks with Square.
3803040	3806480	I don't know if we have anything in the show, but actually one thing I am interested that's
3806480	3809840	coming out, hopefully, that Square is doing is a sequel to The World Ends With You.
3810800	3811280	Yes.
3811280	3812560	They're talking about that.
3812560	3813520	They're supposed to be doing that.
3813520	3813840	Yeah.
3813840	3814960	Good times.
3814960	3815840	Comes out December.
3818080	3819280	Oh, really?
3819280	3821840	No, I'm just saying, wouldn't that be funny because of the Mayan calendar?
3821840	3825840	I thought that was one of your little like mochi tips slipping in there.
3825840	3826400	I don't know.
3826400	3830240	It's just funny because I don't think that our December on the Gregorian calendar would
3830240	3831760	have been the end of their year.
3832320	3836240	You know, I actually, a little bit of trivia on the lunar calendar for the Jewish calendar,
3836240	3837840	we actually don't have a leap year.
3837840	3840880	We have a leap month every, I think, 13 years.
3841440	3842160	So just saying.
3842160	3843760	I want a whole month.
3843760	3844800	You have a whole extra month.
3844800	3846400	Do you have to work in that month?
3846400	3847040	No.
3847040	3847600	Good time.
3847600	3849360	Well, I mean, it's normal stuff.
3849360	3850800	You don't work on Shabbat.
3850800	3853680	Who would run the world then if we didn't work for a whole month?
3855040	3856720	You know, the Jew.
3856720	3857440	Anarchy!
3859040	3859920	Moving on.
3859920	3860320	UK.
3861040	3865440	24th of April, we have FIFA 12, you for Euro 12.
3866720	3869760	The Walking Dead and Prototype 2.
3869760	3872720	There's a game that actually came out on my birthday that I think has a funny name, and
3872720	3876960	I have no idea what it's about, but it makes me think of Benicula as Botanicula.
3878240	3881120	I don't know if anyone ever remembers a book about the vegetarian vampire rabbit.
3882960	3886400	On the 26th of April is Deus Ex Human Revolution.
3886400	3891280	On the 27th binary domain, Blazing Souls Accolade, or is it Assolate?
3891280	3891780	I don't know.
3892400	3895280	And Risen 2 Dark Watters.
3897040	3897680	That would be it.
3897680	3900160	That's all.
3901440	3901940	All right.
3903840	3908080	So I don't know if I should be happy about this, but I guess, you know, company doing
3908080	3909120	well, great.
3909120	3913680	THQ is, you know, their forecast for their earnings has improved.
3914640	3921040	They're saying that now they're reporting a net sales of from 160 million to 170 million.
3921040	3927440	And of course their previous update was from 130 to 150.
3928240	3931040	So what can this be attributed to?
3931040	3937040	Well, it's due to the fact that people have been dumb enough to buy the fucking DLC for
3937040	3938160	Saints Row the Third.
3939200	3942480	And I am proud to say that I am not one of those people.
3942480	3948240	I made the mistake once purchasing one of their content packs or expansions, whatever
3948240	3948960	you want to call it.
3948960	3951600	And it sucked.
3951600	3953760	It was 30 minutes of content for $8.
3954880	3956320	I'm sorry, $7.
3957600	3959760	And I just said...
3959760	3960720	It's cheaper than a hooker.
3962880	3963440	30 minutes?
3963440	3968320	Yeah, that is cheaper than a hooker, but it's definitely not as satisfying.
3968320	3969120	Not as much payoff.
3970800	3972320	When did you start pricing hookers?
3974240	3974960	Don't get me started.
3974960	3977200	Is there something for your birthday I didn't hear about?
3977200	3979200	No, I actually...
3979920	3980560	Nothing.
3980560	3983200	This comes from the episode last week's Supernatural.
3983920	3984480	Of course.
3984480	3985680	I was a fancy lady.
3985680	3986400	What, a hooker?
3987920	3993280	Well, I mean, come on, you have to know that you have to factor in the HMV into everything.
3993280	3997440	I mean, everything's based off the HME, which is the hooker market value.
3997440	4000800	And if you don't know what the hooker market value is, how are you going to know how to
4000800	4003040	price your other goods that are based off the HMV?
4004080	4006960	I'm telling you, this is just street smarts.
4006960	4007760	I mean, seriously.
4008720	4015120	So yes, it's really unfortunate that people were dumb enough to buy this, and most of
4015120	4017280	which was paid unlocked content, by the way.
4017280	4021600	In fact, they're still putting out little costumes and bullshit that was in the game.
4023440	4026400	Sadly though, if they put out a sequel to this game, I'm probably not going to have
4026400	4028320	to buy it, because I do remember earlier...
4029600	4035600	Well, a couple weeks ago while we were out, or while I was out, a certain idiot from...
4035600	4041200	I'm not really sure if he works for THQ or Volition, I believe he works for THQ, was
4041200	4045840	complaining about, you know, I'm not getting enough money from used games.
4045840	4053040	And so, of course, he had to be the first person to enter my list of, hey, if you complain
4053040	4058240	about used game sales and not making anything off of it, I'm going to boycott your game.
4058240	4064000	So Richard Brown, the first inductee into that list, who had worked on many things,
4064000	4065520	including Saints Row the Third.
4065520	4069520	Unfortunately, I am now going to have to be forced not to purchase any more games from...
4069520	4071360	Are you seriously boycotting Saints Row the Third?
4071360	4072000	I don't believe it.
4072000	4073120	I do not believe it.
4073120	4074160	I'm not buying the game new.
4076240	4077920	They will not get any of my new money.
4077920	4080800	Nah, we'll wait till that first trailer is out and I'll ask you again.
4082320	4086960	But yes, he has worked on many games, including Homefront, Renfaction, Armageddon, Saints
4086960	4090560	Row the Third, Stacking, Warhammer 40k, WWE All-Stars.
4090560	4094480	He's basically, I think he's like a producer or something like that over at THQ.
4094480	4097680	He backs the money for this stuff.
4099440	4106320	So yes, and of course he came out bitching about how, you know, oh, they need used game
4106320	4108560	sales because all these excuses.
4109280	4109760	I don't know.
4109760	4115600	I don't even really want to go into detail about it, but it's just, it's annoying.
4115600	4120560	Oh, he needs to talk about the real cost of used games and smuggle bastard.
4121760	4122800	Blah, blah, blah.
4122800	4123760	Blah, blah, blah.
4123760	4124240	Who cares?
4125440	4130720	Well, everybody has Kickstarter fever in the States anyway, because you know, they don't
4130720	4132400	really have anything like it overseas.
4132400	4134240	Cause you know, by the way, I got to say this.
4134240	4139200	There was a great Penny Arcade article on Kickstarter this week about how, you know,
4139200	4142320	people aren't raising the money they thought they would because it's like, oh, I'm making
4142320	4145040	all this money and oh shit, now I have to pay taxes.
4145040	4145520	Oh shit.
4145520	4147200	I have to pay somebody to manage the money.
4147200	4147760	Oh shit.
4147760	4150560	You know, it's, it's, it's kind of the dark side of Kickstarter, if you will.
4150560	4151840	Amazing read.
4151840	4152640	So check that out.
4152640	4153520	It's not the dark side.
4153520	4154880	It's just all these stupid.
4154880	4156720	What's the things that people don't think about?
4156720	4158000	Well, that's your problem.
4158000	4161680	And see, that's kind of one of the reasons why that your project is not working out in
4161680	4165440	the first place because like, Hey, I want to make a game, but you don't think about what's
4165440	4167600	involved in actually making a game.
4167600	4170080	I mean, there is a little bit of the financial end.
4170080	4173760	You have to have people that manage, you know, your money, your marketing and all that stuff.
4173760	4176080	You can't just go make game, make money.
4176080	4178560	I mean, there's, it's a little bit more complex than that.
4179760	4180080	All right.
4181120	4184080	Just a quick note for the podcast folks.
4184080	4187520	Apparently our live listeners lost us, but we show we're still connected and uploading
4187520	4188400	data to the feed.
4188400	4191760	So we're going to just keep right on moving.
4191760	4192000	All right.
4192000	4199280	So anyhow Kickstarter, yes, there is an alternative to Kickstarter called Gambitious.
4199280	4202560	Now this is how the folks overseas are going to get into this.
4202560	4207520	A European indie developers will get this opportunity to use this.
4207520	4209040	There are some differences.
4209040	4210240	This is a Dutch company.
4211040	4214720	They will be filling the crowdfunding void by using their own service.
4215360	4217920	You won't be donating funds to receive gifts.
4217920	4221360	You're actually going to purchase shares of a game's development.
4221360	4223760	So it's almost like a little mini stock market or something.
4223760	4227840	When the game is completed, the user gets dividends like a traditional investor, rather
4227840	4231280	than a copy of a game or a lunch date or whatever it is that you're doing.
4231280	4233680	That's kind of cool. It's different.
4233680	4237280	It's, it's a very smart way of, it's a, it's a very smart British way of thinking about
4237280	4237600	it.
4237600	4238480	I like it.
4238480	4239920	I wish it would do something like that over here.
4240720	4241440	They were kind of cool.
4244080	4244720	Very strange.
4246080	4246480	All right.
4247360	4252080	So, um, let's move on to a segment we like to do every week here on the show.
4252640	4253520	I know we're not live.
4253520	4255920	We still have a big group that listens to us on the podcast.
4255920	4259520	And for the record, um, the, they say that the play button's got a slash through it.
4259520	4261760	I just went to the site and it looks fine to me.
4261760	4262000	Yeah.
4262000	4262800	I don't know what's going on.
4262800	4264800	We, we still show we're feeding information.
4264800	4268640	So, um, I think it's just some type of technical snafu.
4268640	4271440	It just would not be a live show without technical snafus.
4271440	4273280	Anyway, let's just get into the classic game of the week.
4273280	4274880	We're going to keep moving for the podcast folks.
4278240	4281920	Dark soccer is going to dive into the gaming vault and find one game that she thinks, Hey,
4282560	4283680	you ungrateful bitches.
4283680	4285600	You should be playing this game right the hell now.
4285600	4290240	Now, dark soccer, what is the classic game of the week?
4290240	4298320	The game is Kid Icarus, also known as in Japan as Hikari Shinwa Palutena no Kagami,
4298320	4300480	which is light mythology Palutena's mirror.
4301040	4306000	Um, it is, um, an action platform game that came out of the Famicom disc system in Japan
4306000	4308160	and cartridge in the U S North America.
4308960	4315200	Um, and in Europe, it was the very first Kid Icarus game.
4315200	4321040	And it came out in Japan in December, 1986 and in Europe and North America in February
4321040	4324320	and July, 1987 respectively.
4324320	4331360	Um, we had a GBA version in 2004, a Wii virtual console version in 2007 and the sequel, um,
4331360	4334160	that came out on Game Boy in 1991.
4334160	4340320	And of course the third version that came out on Nintendo 3DS in March, 2012, sorry,
4340320	4343440	which having played a little bit of it, loved it, won it.
4343440	4344160	Oh my God.
4344160	4350400	So anyway, so basically you are Pit, who is a cute little angel trying to find the three
4350400	4357520	sacred treasures, which he has to, uh, uh, use to rescue, uh, their goddess of Angel
4357520	4358480	and Palutena.
4359200	4364080	Uh, you basically go through different areas where you can scroll up and you've got your
4364080	4370480	little, uh, dungeon levels where you have to go on kind of like a grid map type of thing.
4370480	4372240	Then it's really a neat little game.
4372240	4376080	It's, uh, you basically have to reach the end of the levels, defeat the monster that
4376080	4377440	guards the three treasures.
4377440	4382640	And, um, it actually was done by Nintendo's, uh, research and development one division
4382640	4389040	that, uh, meant, uh, it was designed by, um, Toru Asawa and Yoshio Sakamoto and directed
4389040	4390560	by Satoru Okada.
4390560	4391840	And you know who produced it?
4391840	4395280	Gunpei Yokoi, who is the man.
4395280	4402400	So, um, it actually had kind of mixed reception when it came out.
4402400	4407920	There were people that did not like it, but it's, you know, been a classic to everyone
4407920	4408400	since.
4408400	4414480	Um, the, uh, Game Boy version that came out was Kid Icarus of Myths and Monsters in 1991.
4414480	4416880	And then we had to wait for 20 years.
4416880	4420720	So now we have, uh, Kid Icarus Uprising and everything's cool.
4420720	4423520	But hey, we still have Pit in Super Smash Brothers Brawl.
4423520	4430560	So basically with this one, like I said, it is a platformer, uh, you go through different
4430560	4436000	levels and you have, uh, um, you know, you, you collect health, you collect hearts, which
4436000	4439840	you can use to buy stuff, and, uh, you also have a score.
4440960	4445440	Now, as you go through that, you can go through different, uh, chambers that sometimes they're
4445440	4445920	a market.
4446640	4450480	And, um, sometimes you, uh, have to defeat certain monsters.
4450480	4456800	You have a god's chamber where, um, your bow and arrow can be, um, increased in strength
4456800	4457840	by different factors.
4458560	4464160	And sometimes, uh, it depends on how many enemies you've defeated or how much damage
4464160	4465040	you've taken in battle.
4465040	4470240	And then you also have a training chamber where you can get, uh, one of three power
4470240	4471920	items if you pass the test.
4472720	4476240	So then you have, um, basically you've got the three stages, the underworld, the surface,
4476240	4483280	and the sky world, and, uh, they have, um, the, the different, uh, levels and the fortress.
4484240	4490320	And, uh, you know, all the first levels are, um, the underworld and sky stages are basically
4490320	4494880	ones where you're going bottom to top, and then the last one is a side-scrolling level.
4496080	4497840	The surface world, sorry, it's side-scrolling.
4498400	4504240	Um, the, uh, fortresses are non-scrolling rooms and you have to find and defeat the
4504240	4504880	gatekeeper.
4504880	4510160	Um, so you can buy a check sheet, a pencil, and a torch so that you can, you know, basically
4510160	4511280	track yourself on your map.
4512400	4516320	And, um, you can get a hammer that destroys statues which will free a flying soldier called
4516320	4518240	a centurion that will aid you in boss battles.
4519280	4522960	And then when each of the bosses are destroyed, you get one of the sacred treasures.
4522960	4523680	Blah, blah, blah.
4525120	4530800	And, um, the last portion, um, are kind of, uh, like a scrolling shooter.
4530800	4531680	So it's pretty interesting.
4531680	4540080	Um, so, um, the game, like I said, was done by, um, an Nintendo's R&D1 division which,
4540080	4544480	uh, was actually, the programming was done by an outside company called Intelligent Systems.
4545040	4550880	It was meant for the, uh, disk system because, um, with the disk card you could, uh, have
4550880	4554880	three times the storage capacity than the NES cartridges.
4555680	4560240	And then, um, it also could save your progress, um, given that it was on a floppy disk.
4560240	4569040	Um, of course, when it came out on the, uh, the, uh, Nintendo in the U.S., it was on,
4569040	4574880	uh, a, uh, cartridge with, uh, a password system.
4577440	4583360	So, uh, this, a lot went into the creation of this game, actually.
4583360	4590480	It was even said that, um, all of the, uh, the pixel art was drawn by, um, Otsawa himself.
4590480	4591200	That's pretty cool.
4592960	4602080	So, um, it was re-released in, um, 19, uh, sorry, in 2004 in Japan as the Famicom mini
4602080	4604480	disk system selection for the GBA.
4604480	4607120	And, of course, we got it on a virtual console in 2007.
4607120	4612560	Um, you know, remember the cheat codes, Rob?
4614400	4614880	I do.
4614880	4618240	Wasn't there, like, Medusa fights Icarus Angels or vice versa?
4618240	4622240	Icarus fights Medusa Angels, and there was Terror, Danger, Horror.
4622240	4626160	Yes, they took that out of the 3DS remake, if you can believe it.
4626160	4626800	Yeah, they did.
4626800	4628720	That's what I was leading up to.
4628720	4629920	No, my bad.
4629920	4637440	But, um, there were, uh, when, uh, there was, uh, the eShop version of the download code
4637440	4642480	that was given to those who registered two 3DS games, um, with Nintendo in Japan and
4642480	4644720	Europe, or pre-ordered Kid Icarus uprisings.
4645440	4647360	So, that was pretty neat.
4648560	4656000	So, yeah, the game sold 1.76 million copies worldwide by 2003, and definitely, uh, got
4656000	4656960	a cult following.
4656960	4664320	Um, when, uh, there was a magazine in the UK called Nintendo Magazine System that said
4664320	4667680	it was pretty good fun, but did not compare to other platform games.
4668240	4669200	Boo to them.
4669200	4672480	And part of it had to do with their rather dated graphics.
4673280	4678560	Um, but it was said in Retro Gamer, which is a magazine that Dan and I pick up sometime,
4678560	4684640	um, that it was the unsung hero of the NES, looks and sounds pretty, and said that the
4684640	4689680	music is sublime and the enemy characters are brilliantly drawn, which I have to agree
4689680	4691200	with every single last bit of that.
4691840	4700000	Now, um, JeremyParishWithOneUp.com said that it was a fairly forgotten masterpiece and
4700000	4701760	that it was underwhelming, buggy, and annoying.
4702480	4703120	You know what?
4703120	4703920	I say shut up.
4705040	4705600	Agreed.
4706880	4708000	It really is.
4708000	4711680	Now, I will say this, that game is freaking hard as fuck.
4711680	4713920	By hard as fuck, you mean fun?
4713920	4719280	I mean, it's not that it's not fun, but it's just proof that a game could be challenging
4719280	4723360	and still, you know, make you want to keep playing, want to keep doing better.
4723360	4727760	You know, and keep in mind, you know, we've seen Kid Icarus, oh, sorry, I should say Pit.
4727760	4732560	Pit was in Captain N, which that was a horrible show, but it's still part of my childhood.
4733200	4735600	And, um, we've even seen Pit in Tetris.
4735600	4737440	Remember when you win on the harder levels?
4738160	4740000	He pops up on the little windscreen.
4740000	4742000	Uh-huh.
4742000	4747840	Um, F1 Race in Super Smash Brothers Melee, and he was a playable character in Super Smash
4747840	4751600	Brothers Brawl, and they completely redesigned his appearance for that game.
4752800	4757840	Which, you know, that really, when he showed up in Brawl, I think that was the big,
4757840	4760080	oh my god, are we gonna get, you know, Pit?
4760080	4763040	Are we gonna have another game, you know, another Kid Icarus game?
4763040	4765440	Don't you remember all the fuss that that started?
4766480	4767840	I do, I do.
4767840	4771040	And there was all the leaked artwork that had come out before, and all this stuff?
4771040	4771840	That's right.
4771840	4776240	Well, there was, um, they basically, uh, unveiled Kid Icarus Uprising.
4776240	4777520	Sorry, I love the dungeon music.
4778640	4782240	Even though the loop gets annoying as hell after a few minutes, I love the dungeon music.
4782240	4783200	Okay, sorry.
4783200	4786400	You know what I liked, what I used to do in this one when you get turned into an eggplant?
4786400	4789360	Is I would hold down and then slide across the floor as an eggplant.
4789360	4789760	Yes.
4789760	4790800	You couldn't see his little legs.
4791520	4792400	Oh, that was the best.
4792400	4801040	Um, but basically, um, it, the, uh, they revealed Kid Icarus Uprising in E3 2010 and
4801040	4804240	suddenly a 3D shooter that was developed by Project Sora.
4805040	4810400	And that's the same company that did, uh, Super, uh, that's, uh, sorry, the same company
4810400	4814400	that the Smush Brothers designer Masahiro Sakurai is from.
4814400	4820000	So it kind of does go back to that, you know, that thing.
4820000	4825000	There was, um, an unofficial Flash game that was done by Flip Industries called Super Kid
4825000	4830800	Icarus that, um, basically was trying to bridge the gap between the upcoming sequel at the
4830800	4831760	time and the old one.
4832400	4837840	And it had a cheat system that could make, uh, to quote, a very tough game, a walk in
4837840	4843200	the park and, uh, had a reverse difficulty curve.
4843200	4846000	Basically you can play it 16 bit on your web browser.
4846000	4850320	Um, I don't know what became of that because honestly that's the first I had ever heard
4850320	4852800	of it, but now I kind of want to find it and play it.
4853360	4854880	So that's our game, Kid Icarus.
4857120	4857840	All right, there it is.
4857840	4860320	Your classic game of the week, Kid Icarus on the NES.
4860320	4863360	I just think that the, um, the original name is pretty cool though.
4864320	4864640	I do.
4864640	4865040	I like that.
4865040	4868160	Hikari Shinwa, you know, light mythology.
4869120	4869840	Uh, all right.
4870480	4872400	We don't know what's going on with the live feed.
4872400	4874000	We're still showing that we're sending data.
4874000	4878480	Apparently the server itself is down, so we don't know what's up.
4878480	4884160	Um, we, uh, you know, according to folks in chat, this seems to be like a legit server
4884160	4886880	crash that's happening, uh, what have you.
4886880	4887920	So we don't know what's up.
4887920	4890320	Um, we're gonna need to take a little bit of a break here.
4890320	4896080	Um, so we're going to go ahead and play music anyway, even though the podcasters won't hear
4896080	4898960	it, but at least it's chance for us to take a break and figure out how we're going to
4898960	4907040	broadcast part B and we'll be right back.
4907040	4909760	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
4909760	4915440	We are live, sorta, on this Sunday evening, April the 22nd of 2012.
4915440	4918240	Um, just what's going on for the live folks real quick.
4918240	4922960	Um, we flipped it to Ustream, um, which obviously you're figuring this out if you're, you're
4922960	4924240	connecting to the feed right now.
4924240	4927040	And if you see, yep, yes, that video really is live.
4927040	4928480	That's my little hand waving in front of it.
4928480	4929360	But we're shy.
4929360	4931040	So you have to look at Mr. Chocobo.
4931040	4934640	Um, and I don't know what's going on with all games.
4934640	4937520	We care, I am still streaming to the all game server.
4937520	4939440	I'm streaming the both right now.
4939440	4942160	So this is going to be interesting to see if we can have the bandwidth for it.
4942160	4947280	But, uh, the all game, the all games server crashed or something happened.
4947280	4948560	So we don't know what's up.
4948560	4952960	And guys, we suspect it's not, I realized there was a big announcement this week and
4952960	4958480	people are, you know, coming up with conspiracy theories, but we think if it was that, which
4958480	4962960	would be silly if it was that, um, we wouldn't be able to, we would just have the access
4962960	4965760	to, to stream to the feed taken away altogether.
4965760	4967840	Cause they know the IP we broadcast from.
4967840	4969120	So, uh, we don't think it's that.
4969120	4974880	It's just, um, how ironic, how ironic it's like rain on your wedding day.
4975680	4976240	There you go.
4976880	4977280	All right.
4978080	4980320	So anyway, uh, we're going to get back into the show.
4980320	4982640	So for the podcast listeners, you haven't missed it.
4982640	4987280	This is the funny thing about being a podcast listener right now is that with everything
4987280	4991680	that's going on and all the announcements and all the chat we've had tonight, um, nothing
4991680	4994160	is going to, nothing is going to change for the podcast.
4994160	4997360	If you're listening to the show right now as a podcaster and you've never listened
4997360	4999840	live, don't, don't change anything.
4999840	5003520	You'll still get next week's show at the same time and all that good stuff.
5003520	5004800	So, all right.
5004800	5008320	Um, anyhow, let's try to move on with the show best we can.
5008880	5011600	Uh, we're going to move into some rapid fire news.
5011600	5015840	Sorry, I'm, I'm, I guess Dark Soccer's computer just crashed on top of anything, everything
5015840	5016320	else.
5016320	5017840	Won't anything work?
5018480	5019200	Why is technology?
5019200	5020320	Because this is a piece of shit.
5020320	5021600	My husband won't buy me an iPad.
5021600	5024320	Why is technology revolting against us?
5024320	5026080	It's like the fucking Terminator.
5029040	5029280	Okay.
5029280	5031520	I don't have to reboot, but I do have to reopen all my windows.
5031520	5032320	That's all right.
5032320	5035120	We're going to get into some rapid fire news here.
5037840	5038240	Sorry.
5038800	5039920	You everything all right over there?
5039920	5041760	Let's move on with some rapid fire news.
5042960	5044320	Loki, why don't you start us off?
5044320	5044720	All right.
5044720	5046640	Well, Vita is getting some free apps.
5046640	5047840	I actually downloaded one of them.
5047840	5050640	I haven't got a chance to play with the rest yet because I don't think they're up yet,
5050640	5053120	but they, um, they're getting three new apps.
5053120	5054640	One is called Paint Park.
5054640	5056720	Then there's Treasure Park and then Wake Up Club.
5057280	5062320	Um, Paint Park is basically a basic paint program.
5062320	5068000	Um, you can take pictures of crap and draw and share it with your friends and do all
5068000	5068960	that fun stuff.
5068960	5072480	Plus, I believe you can actually draw with friends maybe.
5072480	5076560	Um, and you can also use the rear touch pad and the front touch pad and all that fun stuff.
5076560	5078480	Um, so that's neat.
5078480	5082560	Then later this summer, they're going to be, um, introducing Treasure Park and Wake Up
5082560	5083280	Call.
5083280	5088800	Um, I guess Treasure Park is an app that lets you create your own puzzles and send them
5088800	5093680	out to your friends, um, using Nier and I guess 3G.
5093680	5100000	And then also Wake Up Call is an alarm clock app, uh, that syncs with your alarm or syncs
5100000	5102880	your alarm with other PlayStation Vita users.
5104320	5106800	I don't understand why you would want to do that.
5106800	5111440	And it says there's also a competitive element where players can set a goal or set goals
5111440	5114720	and are awarded for meeting or exceeding.
5114720	5115520	I don't get it.
5115520	5116240	That's stupid.
5117600	5119760	Set your alarm goal.
5119760	5121680	I mean, what's the point of that?
5121680	5123120	It doesn't make any sense.
5123120	5126240	That is very, turning alarms, alarm clocks into a video game.
5126240	5126720	I'm not sure.
5126720	5130080	You know, how quickly you answer the alarm.
5130080	5131520	I don't understand.
5131520	5133200	I could use something like that, actually.
5133200	5135680	I'm the type of person that'll hit the damn snooze for an hour.
5135680	5141760	So something to motivate me to set four alarms, actually get out of bed, you know, a shiny
5141760	5144960	sticker for my alarm clock park or whatever it's called.
5144960	5146720	But yeah, Paint Park is available right now.
5146720	5150320	It is free, so you can check it out and play around with that.
5150320	5156240	I actually, I haven't turned my Vita on in a few weeks, so I missed a lot of stuff on
5156240	5156400	there.
5156400	5159120	I downloaded the Wipeout demo.
5159120	5162160	I want to check that out because people keep saying that's a good game to get.
5162160	5168720	And then also there is like some AR thing with resistance that you can play with.
5168720	5173920	And then there's that other free like puzzle game that they've got where I guess it's limited
5173920	5175120	plays per day or something like that.
5175120	5176640	Hey, but it's free, so you can try it.
5176640	5178080	And if it sucks, you can delete it.
5178080	5182560	I still have to, I have an eight gig card, I still have to move everything over too,
5182560	5183920	but I haven't gotten a chance to do that yet.
5184800	5185920	So fun, fun.
5187920	5193680	Yeah, something else that's kind of cool DLC wise, you know, LittleBigPlanet had a lot
5193680	5195280	of cool DLC when it came out.
5195280	5199200	And of course they're going to kind of continue on doing it without LittleBigPlanet carting.
5200240	5206400	With pre-order, I'm assuming at major retailers, Amazon GameStop they're mentioning, you get
5206400	5208240	free Kevin Butler DLC.
5208240	5210640	That's right, the fake VP himself.
5210640	5215440	You get the Sackboy costume and his golf cart to play as.
5215440	5218320	How nice that they can still find a use for that mascot, right?
5219600	5220800	He was awesome.
5220800	5221360	You know what?
5222240	5224080	Fucking bring him over to Nintendo.
5224080	5226880	That's the kick in the pants that Nintendo needs right there.
5226880	5231520	It's a good marketing campaign or we haven't gotten to this yet.
5231520	5233120	Oh, I'll save that for later.
5233120	5239920	Anyways, last but not least, there's a rumor, or I should say a campaign sort of, to bring
5239920	5245840	Archer, the FX animated series, to Pinball FX as a table.
5245840	5253440	And apparently this is, it came to fruition via some tweets from the Archer production
5253440	5254160	designer.
5254160	5260400	I guess someone tweeted the Archer production designer and art director and then he's like,
5260400	5264560	and then he's like, well, yeah, hey, you know, that sounds like a cool idea.
5264560	5266160	You know, Zen Studios wants to do it.
5266160	5270720	Then I guess we can, you know, send the idea to FX and see if they're game for it.
5270720	5273200	And then Zen Studios is like, hell yeah, we'll do it.
5273200	5278000	And so, you know, now it's kind of in FX's hands to, you know, whether or not they were
5278000	5282800	going to put the wheels in motion, I guess, and they're going to swap contact information
5282800	5285440	and maybe we'll have an Archer table some day.
5286560	5287120	That'd be neat.
5287120	5288800	That would actually be all kinds of awesome.
5288800	5293280	I so supported this idea, even though if I recall correctly, Pinball FX has a spy table.
5293920	5294640	Who cares?
5294640	5296640	Archer's like 10 times better than that.
5296640	5300800	So, you know, that's all for that is I really wanted to like Archer, but I hate it, but
5300800	5301440	I think it's good.
5302000	5302240	Yes.
5302240	5303760	Archer's hilarious.
5303760	5305760	I hate it, but I hate you.
5305760	5306880	But here's the thing though.
5306880	5309120	I hated the office when I first watched it too.
5309120	5312800	It's one of those things that you got to go back later on and you're like, oh, this is
5312800	5316000	funny or like it's always sunny and felt no, actually it's always saying it was always
5316000	5318000	funny, but, um, it looks stupid.
5318000	5319680	Like it's always sunny, looked terrible.
5319680	5320640	And that's true.
5320640	5323040	The first time I watched, it's always sunny in Philadelphia.
5323040	5326000	I hated it, but now I think it's like one of the most hilarious shows on TV.
5326000	5330720	So it's, I'm willing to go back and try it again, but it's just right now.
5331840	5332240	I don't know.
5332240	5335760	I don't have time, but I'll eventually go back and watch Archer and hopefully enjoy
5335760	5335840	it.
5336400	5338480	Um, let me just quickly plug our chat room.
5338480	5340240	Chat dot orange on traded.com.
5340240	5342640	I don't know if any stragglers are finding us through Ustream.
5342640	5344160	This is our backup right now.
5344160	5346160	The all game server stopped responding.
5346160	5347520	So we're continuing on with the show.
5347520	5349520	You can't stop us that easily internet.
5349520	5352160	So we're continuing on, uh, chat dot orange launch.com.
5352160	5355680	If you want to chat with us, I don't even know if the Ustream TV chat room is there,
5355680	5357120	but if it is, we're not looking at it.
5357120	5361680	So you need to go to chat dot orange launch radio.com to chat with us, uh, live as we're
5361680	5364800	doing our little radio show on this Sunday evening.
5364800	5368400	Also, I want to open up the ask orange lounge line.
5368400	5372800	Send a private message to sky S K I E in the chat room at chat dot orange lounge,
5372800	5378000	city.com if you have a question for ask orange lounge, and we're going to get to that shortly
5378000	5380880	after a few more stories quickly.
5381520	5385120	This is really sad and this is something I think it happened on the week we were off,
5385120	5388160	but you know, we need to say it and tip our hat to this.
5388160	5393760	Um, Jack Tramiel, uh, he founded the company that created the Commodore 64.
5393760	5397600	He died at the age of 83, um, according to Forbes magazine.
5397600	5402720	And you know, if you grew up on the Commodore family of computers like I did, um, then Jack
5402720	5405680	Tramiel was obviously somebody important to you.
5405680	5407200	So rest in peace.
5407840	5411600	Um, going to a completely different topic here on Nintendo.
5411600	5414640	Uh, real quick, I'm sorry.
5414640	5420720	I don't, I didn't have a 64, but, uh, wasn't it like the command to like start a program
5420720	5426560	or something like 80 something or load quote star quote comma eight comma one.
5426560	5428400	Uh, that would've been ironic if it was four.
5428960	5429680	You know what?
5429680	5435200	There were, um, that was actually the same, uh, command on the Apple two E wasn't no Apple
5435200	5436480	for some of the games that I played.
5436480	5439040	It was, I thought Apple did something different.
5439040	5442000	It was like you do, it was similar, but it wasn't a star.
5442000	5444800	The star was unique to Commodore and the comma eight comma one.
5444800	5447280	Cause comma eight is what called out the disk drive.
5447280	5450000	And I think if you had a tape drive, it was comma seven.
5450000	5454640	Like I think I remember doing the comma eight comma one on the, um, Apple.
5454640	5456480	Are you sure you weren't playing a comma for load runner?
5458320	5458640	All right.
5458640	5461680	Well, the load runner was multi-platform, but anyway, let's move on.
5461680	5464800	I'm talking about Miyamoto being a damn tease.
5465440	5469680	Miyamoto had a conversation with the edge at edge online.com.
5469680	5473040	And, uh, yeah, he was talking about, you know, some first party stuff.
5473040	5477280	Cause that's what we really want to see Nintendo do, especially, you know, after the 3DS didn't
5477280	5481600	have a lot going for it, uh, when it first launched, you know, a lot of people were talking
5481600	5483280	about what titles they would like to see on it now.
5483280	5486880	And now, especially with the Wii U and we talked about some of this earlier.
5486880	5489040	Well, Miyamoto is kind of in on this too.
5489680	5495040	He said, quote, I think I'd be even more interested in creating something new, maybe based on,
5495040	5497600	or starting from a link to the past.
5497600	5499920	I think it's important to bring some really new software.
5501360	5506720	Now, you know, this has led to rampant speculation and internet wank about the whole thing, but
5507360	5512160	I mean, I, I love the idea of a new link to the past, but hold on.
5512160	5516960	Wasn't Zelda four swords on the GameCube kind of a redo of the link to the past.
5516960	5521040	It's not like that idea hasn't been touched since the Super Nintendo days.
5521040	5521600	That's not true.
5521600	5525040	The Game Boy Advance games and the portable games were really like that until it went
5525040	5525840	on Wind Waker.
5525840	5527280	I do have to make a rebuttal real quick.
5527280	5529520	I was thinking of my cousin's Commodore 64.
5530400	5531040	Ah, okay.
5531040	5531440	Sorry.
5531440	5532000	That's all right.
5532000	5538880	Um, it would mean to me, I think he's looking at kind of like, um, doing the new Super Mario
5538880	5543200	approach to it where basically they kind of do an updated engine, but the kind of old
5543200	5544480	school play style.
5544480	5548320	So you would have like an updated engine, maybe a top down Zelda game, kind of like
5548320	5552640	it was, but my God, put an editor in there, put a community feature where people can create
5552640	5555440	their own, like, you know, quests and stuff like that.
5556240	5559600	You're talking like money in the bank right there.
5559600	5564880	I mean, it would be epic and it would be really something that Nintendo would kind of say,
5564880	5569200	kind of say, Hey, look, we understand the internet and community features and stuff
5569200	5569440	like that.
5569440	5574960	Instead of pretending that you do or say, Hey, now we can do updates, you know, for
5574960	5575920	games are buggy.
5576480	5577360	We're with it.
5577360	5578000	We're cool.
5580720	5585920	Now this is the other big part of this is that he was asked about F zero.
5586560	5587200	So excited.
5587200	5591760	And he did say this quote, maybe with future hardware with Wii U coming up, maybe we could
5591760	5596480	create something that does make sense either as a smaller game or a fully fledged title.
5597360	5598480	Yes, please.
5598480	5603040	But that's an interesting way for him to phrase it either as a smaller game.
5603040	5607360	Could this be talking about like a Wii U where type of game?
5607360	5608960	Is that what we're talking about?
5608960	5610480	Or a small as in portable?
5611120	5615040	There's a lot you can read into that and probably way more than Miyamoto intended anybody, but
5615040	5617040	you will not calm the fanboy wank down.
5618160	5618960	Riddle me this.
5618960	5623840	Yes, so I'm assuming that this little tablet controller thing that they're going to put
5623840	5627280	out is probably going to have some sort of ARM processor in there, something that can,
5627280	5630080	you know, obviously render some video and that kind of stuff.
5630080	5633440	Well, a lot of these tablet devices are based off of certain ARM processors.
5633440	5636880	Could you, for example, and there were some other patents, which I don't know if we have
5636880	5643040	a story on, but whatever, um, you know, could you, for example, imagine that, Hey, guess
5643040	5643280	what?
5643280	5647600	Just like, you know, the pocket station or even like the Vita or something like that,
5647600	5652480	you know, Hey, you can take a version of your gaming experience on the road with you.
5652480	5657280	So for example, like, Hey, uh, we're going to create like a virtual console app that
5657280	5658320	runs on this tablet.
5658320	5658800	And guess what?
5658800	5659200	You know what?
5659200	5664960	Not only does a tablet screaming or stream your gameplay from the TV, but you can take
5664960	5666720	that tablet with you and play on the road.
5669120	5670080	These like games.
5671680	5673760	Well, but there's the whole like streaming.
5674560	5676160	Well, it doesn't have to stream the content.
5676160	5679040	I'm saying that the processor would be able to render its own content.
5679040	5684800	Um, and yes, you could do this also with the 3DS where you would have just a virtual console
5684800	5687440	game or, you know, 3DS app or something like that.
5687440	5692560	But it would be kind of a neat way to get people interested because, well, then again,
5692560	5699040	they would also kind of cut themselves in the knee by, um, you know, basically offering
5699040	5702960	a portable system with a console system, but it might get people to buy the system.
5703840	5704400	Very true.
5704400	5708880	Uh, one more story for you guys before I turn it over to Dark Sakura, and that is for you
5708880	5709840	Bimani fans.
5709840	5710800	Where are you at?
5710800	5711200	Holla!
5711920	5718480	BeatMania 2DX 20, or as I like to call it 20th style, even though that pisses the hardcore
5718480	5723920	off because this is really called BeatMania 2DX 20 Tricoro is the name of the game.
5723920	5726240	Konami has confirmed it exists.
5726240	5727040	It exists.
5727040	5728160	It's called Tricoro.
5728960	5733120	The three color scheme is kind of what they're going with with the whole red, yellow, blue
5733120	5737840	and, uh, location testing is underway April 19th through the 24th in Japan.
5738640	5740640	Happy birthday to me in Japan.
5741440	5741680	Right.
5742560	5743840	Um, I'm going to be honest.
5743840	5749280	I haven't followed the BeatMania 2DX series since about what style was like DJ Troopers
5749280	5750240	probably even before that.
5750240	5752640	Happy Sky, 12, 13.
5752640	5752880	Yeah.
5752880	5755280	I think the last one I actually touched was an Empress.
5756080	5756640	Oh, wow.
5756640	5758240	I didn't even play an Empress ever.
5758240	5759120	Like, oh, but they did.
5759120	5760320	They did have the PS2.
5760320	5762960	I keep forgetting they cranked out those PS2 games right up.
5762960	5764160	Empress was the last one.
5764160	5764480	Yeah.
5764480	5765360	I keep forgetting that.
5766080	5767760	So, well, there you go.
5767760	5774880	Anyway, 2DX 20th is happening and it's location testing right now, but Mani's not dead in
5774880	5775380	Japan.
5776240	5778240	Well, uh, there's a few other things.
5778240	5783040	How about some new Kinect games that are, uh, for kids that actually, I kind of want
5783040	5784240	to get one of these.
5784240	5786240	It's Kinect Sesame Street TV.
5787760	5790080	It's got Cookie Monster and Groover.
5790080	5791840	There's no Elmo to be seen.
5792480	5792980	Yay.
5793600	5796400	But that's going to launch, um, autumn 2012.
5796400	5800480	That's according to the Arganon CEO, James Bustal.
5800480	5805920	And then there is a Kinect National Geographic, like Nat Geo TV, it says.
5805920	5808800	And that's being put out by C21 Media.
5809360	5810160	That's pretty cool.
5810880	5812560	I would get the Sesame Street one.
5812560	5813120	Just saying.
5814480	5819840	And then there is a leaked trailer that if it's to be believed, then Resident Evil 6
5819840	5821280	will come out on October 2nd.
5822000	5824560	I'm sure there's a few people who are still into that series.
5826320	5826820	A few.
5827440	5830000	Well, Resident Evil 6 looks, you know, hot.
5830000	5833680	A lot of people are very excited about it, but according to not a side story, which is
5833680	5834480	a good thing.
5834480	5840000	According to this trailer, the protagonist is, uh, Wesker's son, the man who's told
5840000	5840800	to save the world.
5842240	5847520	And then last but not least, Brink has sold more than 2.5 million copies worldwide.
5847520	5849360	That's pretty cool.
5851200	5852000	Good job, Brink.
5852560	5853600	Yay, Brink.
5854320	5854800	All right.
5854800	5858160	Well, honestly, that's a lot better than I thought that game did, because I thought that
5858160	5859360	game tanked.
5859360	5859680	Yeah.
5859680	5862880	But that warrants a sequel, I would say.
5862880	5864160	I mean, that's very true.
5864880	5866560	I hope they're smart enough not to do one.
5868240	5868560	All right.
5868560	5873120	Well, since tonight was supposed to be a kind of a special show at All Games Radio, although
5873120	5875760	the server issues are holding us back, we're still going on YouTube.
5875760	5877040	It's a different type of special now.
5877040	5878480	It's a different type of special.
5878480	5879440	It's Fupa now.
5879440	5879920	That's right.
5879920	5880720	Fupa Fupa.
5881520	5886160	So we thought we would do, instead of the Fugal Question of the Week, we would do Ask
5886160	5887200	Orange Lounge tonight.
5887200	5889760	We don't do this segment very often, but it's when we open it up.
5890480	5892080	It is the show where every gamer has a voice.
5892080	5895920	You want to ask us anything, especially, you know, with what's going on tonight.
5896640	5897840	You can send a private message.
5897840	5899680	You want to ask us about life or anything.
5901680	5902000	All right.
5902000	5904160	You can send that over private message to Sky.
5904160	5910160	So let's cue up the music.
5910160	5913600	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
5913600	5916880	Well, will we find out tonight on Orange Lounge Radio?
5917520	5921680	One thing I'd like to know is why can't we stream on All Games anymore?
5921680	5925120	It was supposed to be a special show, but leave it to us to get fucked.
5925120	5925440	All right.
5929680	5930640	First question tonight.
5932800	5933680	Loco Poco.
5933680	5934320	I love that name.
5935040	5936960	Reminds me of like Poco Roco.
5936960	5940320	Loco Poco wants to know if RuPaul's Drag Race was a fighting game.
5940320	5941760	Thank God for serious questions.
5941760	5943680	Thank God for serious questions.
5944320	5949520	If RuPaul's Drag Race was a fighting game, how bad would RuPaul be as a final boss if
5949520	5951440	he had SNK boss syndrome?
5952720	5953840	Well, you know, it's funny.
5953840	5956880	I don't know if you've seen the video for Glamazon, but it's on the internet.
5956880	5959680	You know, the big video that features the three finalists.
5959680	5961920	It has like a video game theme.
5961920	5962480	Funny enough.
5962480	5967200	And it's, you know, the three queens that beat all the other ones, like being big Glamazon
5967200	5968000	robot stepping up.
5968000	5970400	But there's a lot of like video game graphics in it and stuff.
5970400	5973680	So it was clearly inspired by games.
5973680	5974800	You want to know something funny?
5975520	5984080	Like in the early 90s, my friend had an avatar online called Glamazon who was a large buxom
5984080	5986720	overweight Wonder Woman.
5986720	5991120	So, um, how bad would RuPaul be as a final boss?
5991120	5996000	Um, I, you would sashay all over your face.
5996000	6002880	Uh, but seriously, what would a dream fighting game crossover that has yet to be done be
6002880	6005360	a dream fighting game crossover that hasn't happened yet?
6006320	6012480	I don't know about fighting game, but I do know what I would like as a, uh, um, survival
6012480	6013280	horror game.
6013280	6014320	I'd like a supernatural game.
6014320	6017440	I just want a new goddamn killer instinct game.
6017440	6018400	Is that too much to ask?
6019040	6021280	We'll say killer instinct versus mortal combat.
6021280	6022560	That's that works in my head.
6022560	6023760	That would be pretty epic.
6023760	6025360	I'm going to say that for my answer.
6025360	6031920	I want, um, pretty fighter versus Oscar 120% who only say go Saturn fighting game.
6031920	6032960	People know what I'm talking about.
6034160	6037120	Tiger claw thinks RuPaul's drag race would be more of a cart racing game.
6037680	6041200	Gio video says RuPaul would be a fierce final boss, fierce, fierce.
6041200	6044400	All right, moving on to a question from act deft.
6045280	6046960	Here we go with a serious question, guys.
6046960	6047680	All right.
6047680	6054240	What's the thing or are the things you have regretted doing in the show and why anything
6054240	6057040	you think or know you did wrong or shouldn't have done at all.
6059680	6061040	Regrets a strong word.
6061040	6062560	Oh, I think I know what Loki says.
6062560	6063120	Go ahead.
6063120	6063840	Karaoke.
6066800	6070320	Um, I'm sure there's things I've said.
6070320	6073760	In fact, I know there's things I've said where I've kind of gone back and changed my mind
6073760	6074240	later on.
6074240	6078080	And I think, boy, I sounded kind of stupid and ignorant saying that, um, my opinion on
6078080	6082000	some games ends up changing, but you know, that's part of this process.
6082000	6085040	And that's kind of the risk that we take doing this show every week.
6085040	6090080	And having done it for so long is that, you know, sometimes we're going to grow up in
6090080	6090880	front of you.
6090880	6092880	And in a lot of ways that's kind of happened.
6092880	6097280	You know, when we started this show, we were 10 years younger than we are now.
6097280	6099920	We went from being in our early twenties to being our early thirties.
6099920	6102160	And I think there's just a lot of like kind of growing up that happens.
6102800	6107280	I'm going to be honest, although I think are the old shows for OLR are great.
6107280	6110480	And I'm really proud of a lot that we accomplished in the old shows.
6110480	6115120	When I go back and listen to old episodes, like anything before episode like 150, really,
6115120	6116400	I go back and listen to the old stuff.
6116400	6120640	It's really hard for me to listen to because I'm like, Oh God, Oh God, there's so much
6120640	6121840	technically wrong with this.
6121840	6124960	And it just sounds like a hot fucking mess everywhere.
6124960	6129920	So, I mean, I wouldn't call that a regret, but it's definitely something we've really
6129920	6131760	like learned a lot from.
6132560	6138080	So, I mean, otherwise, as far as specific instances, I can't, maybe when I had my diva
6138080	6139920	fit, I'm not really proud of that moment.
6140480	6145200	That was, you know, back when the show, ironically, when the show died halfway through and, uh,
6145200	6147600	something just set me off and I think it was on Justin TV.
6147600	6149760	I don't know the place where we used to stream.
6149760	6150400	So I don't know.
6150400	6158000	Um, that, that wasn't a highlight of my career, certainly, but regret regrets a strong word
6158000	6160960	because you learn from every little fuck up, you know?
6162640	6163040	All right.
6164000	6170160	Rama asks, what game you played was so bad, you said, fuck this shit, drop the controller
6170160	6170640	and left.
6172880	6174000	What game was so bad?
6174000	6176720	You said, fuck this shit, drop the controller and left.
6176720	6177760	Oh, I'm sorry.
6177760	6178800	You didn't, you weren't jumping in.
6178800	6182400	I assumed you, you, what do you, what would you like to say for regrets?
6182400	6182800	Nothing.
6185440	6185920	Bitch.
6185920	6186420	All right.
6187600	6189120	I haven't rod rolled you enough.
6190240	6193520	Uh, game where you drop the controller and said, fuck this shit.
6193520	6195840	Fusion, Fusion Frenzy 2.
6195840	6197600	So fucking terrible.
6197600	6198080	That game.
6198080	6200640	I was like, what the hell is this garbage that I'm playing?
6200640	6201920	Yaris would be a good one.
6203040	6205040	Sonic 4 episode 1.
6205040	6205920	Sorry to say.
6207280	6208000	Loki.
6208000	6208800	Bullet Witch.
6209440	6210560	Oh yeah.
6210560	6212720	Oh yeah.
6212720	6216400	And actually Oni Chumbara because it was pretty annoying.
6216960	6222000	The whole having to have your sword get dirty and it gets stuck in zombies is stupid.
6222000	6223920	A sword would not get stuck in zombies.
6223920	6225600	A sword chops zombies in half.
6227920	6230800	Um, let's see, going to, I'm going to try to burn through the rest of these questions
6230800	6231520	here pretty quick.
6231520	6236880	Randy says, have you guys ever looked through your game collections only to find a sealed
6236880	6237280	game?
6237280	6237840	Oh God.
6237840	6238560	All the time.
6238560	6239200	All the time.
6239200	6243680	This happened to my cousin and a shrink trap copy of NBA 2K10 yesterday.
6244240	6245360	All right, Randy.
6245360	6250720	No, I found the Blue Seed RPG about a month ago for Saturn.
6251280	6253360	I have a copy right over there.
6253360	6256640	Pilot wings resort on the 3DS still sitting in the shrink trap.
6257920	6258960	Stupid me.
6258960	6261440	Might as well sell that stuff for new on eBay.
6261440	6261760	Right.
6263440	6265440	Matt, anything that you've had?
6265440	6271520	Um, I just have, I have copies, but I'm nothing that I didn't know I have because I normally
6271520	6273520	don't leave that stuff, you know, shrunk.
6274480	6279840	Um, I have still a shrunk copy of, um, Earth Defense Force, the original one, because I
6279840	6281920	bought five copies of it.
6281920	6285520	Well, actually I bought three copies when we were selling them at my work for five bucks
6285520	6286080	each.
6286080	6287440	I'm like, I can't pass it up.
6287440	6289440	I am buying all the copies of those games.
6290080	6290800	So I kept them.
6290800	6296480	And funny enough, I actually, uh, I broke a couple copies of mine and, um, it's still
6296480	6300480	worth actually pretty, you know, a pretty good amount of money, I think, because it's
6300480	6301600	hard to find now.
6301600	6301840	All right.
6301840	6302400	I'm going to close.
6302400	6306640	Which, by the way, Sandbox Games is working on a new version of Earth Defense Force and
6306640	6307040	I'm very excited.
6307040	6309040	Actually, Rob, there is another game that we have that's still shrink wrapped.
6309040	6309680	What's that?
6309680	6315440	That's, um, uh, Gunstar Heroes for the, uh, Game Gear.
6315440	6316000	Serious.
6316000	6317760	Why, why when you got the Genesis one?
6317760	6318080	All right.
6318080	6319520	Well, I bought it for Dan as a treat.
6319520	6322480	I'm going to end no more questions because I got five questions in queue.
6322480	6324160	So question time is up.
6324160	6325520	I'm going to get to read my question.
6325520	6326240	These five questions.
6326240	6327200	I'm not reading your question.
6327200	6328000	My question is great.
6328640	6331040	Dark Sakura asks, why you so fly?
6332240	6333200	Because I'm hot.
6333200	6333440	All right.
6333440	6334240	Moving on.
6334240	6339760	Uh, GZDR4EV wants to know, according to Wiki is a deep question.
6339760	6344880	According to Wiki, 68% of the population believes in some type of religion.
6344880	6349120	So why aren't there more video games with a religious theme?
6349920	6351040	Controversy.
6351040	6352000	Hi people.
6352000	6355520	You get one little thing about someone's religion wrong and they want to just go,
6355520	6357760	eh, sacrilegious, bleh.
6357760	6359120	I, I think it is part that.
6359120	6363680	I mean, even though the stat is 68% believe, the problem is that split up into how many
6363680	6365280	different types of religions.
6365280	6368560	So, you know, and like Dark Sakura says, you get something wrong.
6369120	6374560	I don't think, you know, I, you may not kind of put the two in the same category, but I
6374560	6380480	think there's a lot of games where spirituality is a theme, especially a lot of modern RPGs.
6380480	6385200	I think especially a lot of the newer final fantasy games, uh, Mass Effect to some extent
6385200	6386720	has a little bit of those themes in it.
6386720	6392240	I mean, it's not really in your face, but there definitely is questions about, you know,
6392240	6394400	the big picture, which is what religion's about.
6394400	6398320	All these different, um, especially in RPGs, like you were saying, all these different
6398320	6400480	worlds have their own mythologies.
6400480	6405520	You know, like, for example, I'm just, uh, you know, I'm going to use World of Warcraft.
6405520	6408400	D.R. Foy have thought about, forgot about Battle of Olympus.
6408400	6413040	Yeah, no, but, um, I'm just gonna use World of Warcraft as an example, just because it's
6413040	6413600	fresh my mind.
6413600	6415040	I just finished that thrall book today.
6415040	6415600	It was really good.
6416240	6422320	It's got elements of shamanism, which, you know, we have in pagan religions today.
6422320	6426640	They have their light, which I'm assuming is the way they've lined it up as close to
6426640	6431280	an equivalent as Christianity and Judeo-Christian religions.
6431840	6438640	You know, they've got, uh, you know, the devil worshipers, they have all kinds of different
6438640	6443520	cults, you know, but, you know, even apocalyptic cults, which we've got apocalyptic cults here,
6443520	6447120	you know, how many of those people poisoned themselves to get on the giant spaceship on
6447120	6448640	Halley's Comet, you know, whatever.
6448640	6450880	Oh yeah, no, no, that wasn't, it was Hale-bop.
6451520	6452000	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6452000	6452880	That whole thing.
6452880	6454320	The freaky guy on the TV.
6454320	6454560	Yeah.
6454560	6457200	I blame Um-bop for that.
6457200	6462640	But I mean, my point is just using that, I mean, clearly a lot of the religions in that
6462640	6465600	game are parallels for types of religions.
6465600	6473200	You have those archetypes, you know, um, and then you've got like, say, uh, Final Fantasy
6473200	6474240	7, here's an example.
6474800	6482240	You've got, um, the Cetra and their earth religion, you know, the, the soul of the planet,
6482240	6484640	that type of thing.
6484640	6486000	So that's just an example.
6486720	6487280	Yeah.
6487280	6493360	It's, it's not so much that they're mimicking real religions, it's so much that they've
6493360	6498160	created their own mythology based off of what each culture that's made this game understands
6498160	6498960	of other religions.
6499680	6503760	I mean, the same goes into, you know, different anime TV shows, you name it.
6504640	6505840	Wyland has an interesting point.
6505840	6507520	Tekken has an angel and a devil in it.
6508880	6510960	Well, that's also supposed to be genetic too.
6510960	6514240	Xenocore says half the Final Fantasies have that theme, almost anything from Japan.
6514240	6514480	Yeah.
6514480	6516160	Like the whole, you know, spirituality.
6516160	6520800	And here's another idea for anyone who was an old Saturn gamer, you know, like me, there
6520800	6524480	was Black Matrix that was based off of hell mythology.
6525920	6526420	So.
6527680	6528160	All right.
6528160	6532160	Um, SSJ100, good answer by the way, but you know, got to move on.
6532160	6533040	Four questions left.
6533040	6537360	SSJ100 Matt says, if you had the money to buy three arcade machines for yourself, what
6537360	6538160	would they be?
6538160	6542000	I thought this question came up last week, but it was the show that Jason and Alan were
6542000	6542160	on.
6542160	6543520	So let's hear it from you guys.
6543520	6545600	What three arcade machines would you buy?
6546320	6550560	For me, Burger Time, Magic Sword, Spy Hunter.
6552560	6557760	For me, an Ultracade, a Mame, and now Cheater.
6557760	6567440	No, um, I, since I'm going to lump pinball into arcade, um, I'm going to say that I would
6567440	6572480	get, um, probably a Tekken 5, just because I really liked that game.
6573120	6580160	Um, I would get a Strider and then I would probably get a, um, maybe a Theater of Magic
6580720	6581840	pinball or Black Rose.
6582640	6583920	You're cheating with the pinball.
6583920	6584400	Loki.
6584400	6585520	Okay, well then fine.
6585520	6588240	I will get, I will get a disc of Tron.
6588240	6589760	You do what you want.
6589760	6593040	I'll just build an Ultracade or pin Mame or something.
6593040	6596560	Uh, let's see.
6596560	6600000	Well, this is easy because, you know, I already have an arcade machine at home.
6600000	6609200	So, um, the three that I can't get right now, we'll do, uh, see, uh, fourth mix plus a, uh,
6609200	6615200	Max 2 and, uh, whatever the newest, uh, DDR game they have out there to, uh, was it, uh,
6615200	6619120	something versus, uh, Dance Dance Revolution second mix or something?
6619120	6619840	One of those.
6619840	6621200	So three DDR machines.
6621200	6622960	If you want three DDR machines.
6622960	6623840	Well, they're all different.
6623840	6626560	I mean, you know, Max 2 is pretty awesome in its own right.
6626560	6631840	And, you know, uh, uh, fourth mix plus is pretty awesome.
6631840	6636240	And the new game, I haven't played the new DDR game, but that might be pretty cool.
6636240	6639120	Hey Tigercall, the ferret is actually at my house.
6639120	6641920	X3 versus second mix says the chat room.
6641920	6642240	Yes.
6642240	6643760	X3 versus second mix.
6643760	6644800	That's what I'll be getting.
6644800	6646160	Three questions left.
6646160	6651600	Legend of Zaku says looking back, if Konami quickly and directly followed up with a successor
6651600	6657680	to DDR extreme 10 years ago, instead of Supernova, do you think it would have created a different
6657680	6662160	rhythm game community than what it turned out due to ITG taking that place?
6663520	6664480	That's a community.
6664480	6665760	That's a loaded question.
6665760	6668640	I don't think ITG ever truly took its place.
6668640	6674240	ITG caused controversy and kind of splintered the community into a couple, into a couple
6674240	6676320	kind of different sex, if you will.
6676320	6682400	There was, I said sex, um, there was the pro ITG crowd and the anti-ITG crowd, the DDR
6682400	6682720	loyalists.
6682720	6686720	This is how I feel about, about it in regards to the ITG thing.
6686720	6690960	It's like if you were at a restaurant and then a dog took a shit on the sidewalk, would
6690960	6693680	that make a decision about which game, which place you would go to eat?
6694320	6698400	Um, I think what needed to happen is yes, Konami needed to put something out a lot sooner
6698400	6698880	than they did.
6698880	6704400	Konami failed because Konami of Japan refused to take risks.
6705280	6708240	Jason Enos forced them to take a risk here in America.
6708240	6709920	Basically, I shouldn't say forced, but you know what I mean?
6709920	6714240	He pestered and pestered and did the professional version of that for years and years until
6714240	6716400	Konami finally released something over here.
6716400	6721520	When he left Konami and they shut down Konami Hawaii, who was doing a great job with the
6721520	6722560	Xbox games.
6722560	6727040	When they shut down Konami in the Bay Area where the fans were making steps and you know,
6727040	6727600	all that stuff.
6727600	6731040	I think it lost a lot too much to recover from.
6731600	6736480	So honestly, a little weird now seeing like some of these step mania, uh, artists and
6736480	6740560	stuff like that or people that would make music for step mania and DWI and stuff like
6740560	6740800	that.
6741680	6745360	Actually as artists in the game, it's a little odd.
6746160	6746560	All right.
6746560	6747760	Neat, but a little odd.
6747760	6748720	Two questions left.
6748720	6752720	I do have to give another shout out here because I noticed our Ustream count is increasing.
6752720	6754560	This is not a usual thing for us.
6754560	6756000	Uh, we are using this as a backup.
6756000	6760320	Our main feed at All Games Radio, which ironically it was to be our last night on All Games Radio.
6760320	6762080	It died partway through.
6762080	6765120	I am still showing feeding to All Games Radio.
6765120	6767040	So their server's down or something.
6767040	6769920	But anyhow, that's beside the point.
6769920	6771520	You can't shut us up that easy.
6771520	6772880	So here we are in Ustream.
6772880	6775920	If you want to join us in the chat room, chat.orangelaunchradio.com.
6775920	6776880	It's a radio show.
6776880	6779200	That's why you're looking at my Tron figurine on the camera.
6780000	6780320	All right.
6781360	6781840	Moving on.
6781840	6782880	Two questions remain.
6782880	6790800	Xenocore, what game have you resisted playing the most but been the most pleasantly surprised by?
6790800	6795280	Xenocore, you couldn't have given me an easier question because it's going on right now.
6795280	6796320	Mass Effect.
6796320	6799200	I wrote it off originally as, oh, this isn't my type of game.
6799200	6800960	This is like a first person shooter.
6800960	6805360	I watched a friend play it and I saw the most boring parts of the game driving the Mako around.
6805360	6807200	And I was like, eh, not the game for me.
6807840	6811120	Finally, Shane basically threatened to kill me if I didn't play it.
6811120	6813600	I'm like, fine, you know, he's very good at bullying me.
6813600	6814640	So I said, fine, I'll play.
6814640	6816960	Oh, Rob, you should play Mass Effect.
6816960	6817840	Pretty much.
6817840	6818560	Just like that too.
6818560	6819680	That's my Shane impression.
6819680	6824160	I didn't know because he'll do that and tell you to do something.
6824160	6826880	But then when he fights with you, when he fights with you.
6826880	6827360	No, right.
6827360	6829360	You got to play the middle.
6829360	6830960	He'll totally do the little boy thing.
6830960	6832560	I see this fine.
6832560	6834240	I don't care if you play it or not.
6834240	6834640	Stare.
6834640	6842480	So regardless of, you know, the catalyst Mass Effect, I started playing and I absolutely love it.
6842480	6844400	And I think it's a fantastic series.
6844400	6845680	Jamie, anything for you here?
6845680	6846240	Cave Story.
6846800	6848080	Oh, that's true.
6848080	6849200	It was out for years and years.
6849200	6852240	And we just kind of go, oh, well, I had known about Cave Story like forever.
6852240	6856720	And I even actually played some of the old version of it when it was, you know,
6856720	6858320	like a flash download or something.
6858960	6863120	Or I played different incarnations of Cave Story.
6863120	6864720	And then just starting to play it again.
6864720	6867360	And Dan though, he was really into it.
6867360	6869520	So he's like, I'm going to play your Cave Story when you're not here.
6870080	6871040	Fine, play it.
6871040	6871760	I'll get the point.
6872560	6873600	Loki, anything you can think of?
6873600	6875200	A series you wrote off originally?
6875200	6877440	Uh, Call of Duty Modern Warfare.
6877440	6877760	Knew it.
6879680	6880960	Honestly, because I played it once.
6880960	6884800	I was like, eh, I don't really like this as much as I like the World War II ones.
6885360	6887360	I'm not going to really play this.
6887360	6889280	And then went back and it was awesome.
6889280	6894800	So, you know, gung ho into that, um, I don't know.
6894800	6898320	Um, yeah, that's pretty much it, I guess.
6899680	6900000	All right.
6900000	6901840	Last question from Derek H.
6902800	6903200	Question.
6903920	6909040	When women say the good ones are always taken, does that mean if you're still single,
6909040	6909920	you're not a good one?
6912400	6914560	I always heard the good ones are always gay.
6914560	6915840	That's what I always heard.
6916960	6918640	And I'm always like, that's right.
6918640	6921360	No, I was never really in that opinion.
6921360	6924320	You know, because I was like, fuck, I don't want anybody.
6924320	6927360	And then I met Dan and I was like, well, fine, I guess you'll do.
6927920	6930480	No, my husband is the best.
6930480	6931920	Have you ever caught yourself saying that?
6931920	6933360	I mean, you're the one on this show.
6933360	6937200	No, honestly, I haven't because I mean, I've never had a trouble getting a date.
6938400	6941440	I don't know why I guess, you know, cause I've always,
6942560	6946480	I mean, I always thought that I was kind of this undateable geek chick, you know,
6946480	6952400	but I've never really had a problem getting, you know, getting anyone to date me, I guess.
6952400	6952800	Yeah.
6952800	6953600	But what?
6954240	6955920	Can't, nevermind.
6955920	6957600	But I mean, but you know.
6957600	6958960	Can't say anything appropriate to that.
6960000	6963040	No, well, I'm going to go ahead and say this.
6963760	6965760	Out loud and public, Dan was my first and only.
6966400	6970000	Just saying, you know, not that I haven't made out with a bunch of people, but still.
6971840	6976240	But, you know, Dan happened to be the right person at the right time.
6976240	6977760	And he's always been the right person.
6977760	6982320	So I've never, it's never been a case of why are all the good ones taken?
6982320	6985040	It's been, why do all these guys suck?
6985680	6987120	And Oh, someone who doesn't suck.
6987920	6990000	So that's what my experience is.
6990800	6993200	I think, I don't, I don't know if you find this to be the case or not,
6993200	6996480	but I think a lot of times when somebody finds the one,
6997040	6999920	you're kind of surprised a little bit at it.
6999920	7004160	Like, you know, I never thought it would be this or whatever.
7004160	7006720	And I think a lot of times women or anybody, I mean,
7006720	7008240	I've heard gay guys to say that too.
7008240	7009600	I mean, it's not just women that say it.
7009600	7012080	I've heard a lot of people say that, that the good ones are always taken.
7012080	7018080	And I think, you know, it just means that my radar isn't pinging off because I'm very
7018080	7019520	tunnel vision of what I'm looking for.
7019520	7023520	And I have written all over my notepad, you know, what I want my dream boy to be like
7023520	7025680	and everything that's shoved at me in the media and da da da.
7025680	7026800	I'm very tunnel vision.
7026800	7028000	And then it's like, Oh shit.
7029040	7031680	I just fucking fell in love, you know?
7031680	7036480	And even, you know, even though I'm, it's not a woman man situation, you know,
7036480	7040480	Alan, I knew for years online, never would have thought I'd end up with him,
7040480	7041680	moving in with him and all that stuff.
7041680	7043280	But it just, it just happened.
7043280	7044880	And when it happened, it was kind of one of those things.
7044880	7047280	It's like, Oh, well, I knew Dan online for years.
7047280	7047760	Yeah.
7047760	7051040	And this is, you know, when I was in Alabama and had no,
7051040	7054320	I was actually saving up my money to go to Anime Expo,
7054320	7057520	which is the money that I use for my plane ticket to fly out here in the first place.
7057520	7063040	But I mean, I had known Dan forever online and it just happened.
7063760	7070400	I mean, uh, techness says it's because the women who say that are usually dating assholes
7070400	7072240	in our chat room at chat.org.com.
7072240	7075920	I was always dating nice guys, which is true.
7076480	7080000	Like, except for the one girl I went out with who was kind of a bitch like me.
7080000	7082000	That was pretty fun, but it's Alabama.
7082000	7086560	And you don't, I won't even go there about it being Alabama.
7086560	7092720	But I had, I'd broken up with every guy that I had gone out with because he was too nice.
7093680	7097760	I went as someone who would argue with me and not treat me like I was, you know,
7098720	7102080	made of, of fragile eggshell and porcelain.
7102080	7103280	And Dan doesn't treat me like that.
7103280	7108640	He treats me like I'm an equal and like I'm his partner, not just, you know, his woman.
7108640	7109200	You know what I mean?
7110640	7111840	So, all right.
7112400	7114080	Also, I was going to say, because you're in the friend zone,
7114080	7117040	that's why they say that I wish, you know, that's why you hear that.
7117040	7118080	Ooh, the friend zone.
7118080	7121600	Because they can discuss these, these, uh, woman to woman things with you.
7122320	7124080	You know, I will say, I will say something else.
7125760	7129840	I have had guys come back and say I was interested, you know, come back and say
7129840	7134880	they were interested and I'll flat out evaluate would I have dated this person.
7134880	7139040	And for the most part, I can safely say no, like I'm not going to name names,
7139040	7142080	but there was someone who said he was interested in me until he found out I was married.
7142080	7145360	And I just flat out said, well, not to be a bitch about this,
7145360	7146400	but I wouldn't have gone out with you.
7146960	7149040	And this is why I wouldn't have gone out with you.
7149040	7152080	So if I'm the kind of person that you're looking for,
7152080	7153840	this is why I wouldn't have gone out with you.
7154400	7155200	You know what I'm saying?
7156720	7157360	Yeah, I do.
7158160	7160160	And that's very helpful for those guys.
7162080	7163200	Stop being neurotic.
7163200	7163700	All right.
7164880	7165920	Thank you for the questions, guys.
7165920	7168080	We're going to move on with some video game news.
7168080	7171600	Before we do, I have to notice one other thing I just noted was still in the shrink wrap.
7171600	7172640	Going back to that earlier question.
7172640	7173200	Look at this.
7173200	7176800	I have the PlayStation Vita little ARG cards.
7176800	7178000	The AR play cards.
7178000	7178960	Haven't taken them out.
7178960	7179200	Good.
7179200	7181280	You haven't figured out that the AR is broken.
7181280	7183040	So it's really, it's well here.
7183040	7184160	I have a use for them now.
7184160	7187280	I'll put them on the Ustream cam since we suddenly have a video feed tonight.
7187280	7187760	There you go.
7188320	7189040	Look at the cards.
7190320	7193040	You should kind of dried out looking pizza.
7194160	7196160	They're like, it's terrible.
7196160	7201200	I tried playing the soccer game and I spent like 15 minutes trying to get that damn thing
7201200	7201700	to work.
7202320	7202720	No.
7202720	7205920	And I played the fireworks game and I was like, nope, don't care.
7205920	7208240	It's just, it's a waste of time.
7208240	7213280	It's neat, but you know, I need like an actual AR game that doesn't require cards.
7213280	7213920	And that works.
7213920	7215280	You know, that'd be nice if it worked.
7216320	7216820	Just saying.
7218080	7218400	All right.
7218400	7219680	Let's move on with some more gaming news.
7219680	7221600	The mailbag coming up shortly here in a moment.
7221600	7222480	First off, Loki.
7222480	7222800	All right.
7222800	7225440	Let's talk a little bit about Sony.
7225440	7234240	And I mean, I guess they kind of need to have like a, you know, their own Smash Brothers
7234240	7235600	type game because hey, why not?
7235600	7236800	Everyone else is doing it.
7236800	7241440	So yes, they have, there was a rumor, of course, that they were putting out some sort of like
7241440	7244720	game that's going to feature all the PlayStation All-Stars and that kind of stuff.
7244720	7249040	Well, now they've actually registered a domain called PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale.
7249680	7252560	And it is looking to be like that game.
7252560	7256960	Something with maybe all their first party franchise characters from like Heavenly Sword
7256960	7258400	to God of War.
7258400	7260720	Although Heavenly Sword, does anyone really remember that game?
7261440	7261920	I do.
7263040	7265520	So they're going to have all these different characters fighting each other.
7266720	7269280	Maybe in some sort of Smash Brothers type way.
7270560	7272960	Originally, I guess it was on their working title, Title Fight.
7273760	7279840	Rumored to be announced actually this week on Spike TV's The Game Trailers TV show.
7279840	7281920	So when's that show on?
7281920	7282420	Thursday.
7283520	7287120	So I guess we'll find out this week if that's the case.
7287120	7288720	Most likely probably going to be the case.
7290400	7291920	So neat, I guess.
7294560	7295060	I don't know.
7297520	7298020	Cool.
7299040	7301520	We'll see how this really kind of works.
7302080	7306240	Well, I mean, obviously they're going to kind of take the successful Super Smash Brothers
7306240	7307920	format and put their own spin on it.
7307920	7313200	I mean, it's yeah, I don't know if they have quite the recognizable lineup of character.
7313200	7317200	Well, I don't think I can really throw that kind of shade at it because, you know, there
7317200	7318560	are some big characters.
7318560	7319760	They're just like, I don't see.
7319760	7323440	I mean, like, there's no, like, this is not a kart racing game.
7323440	7324960	You know, they have a little big planet for that.
7325520	7326320	But here's the thing.
7326320	7330800	Like Nintendo, you know, Smash Brothers makes sense because there's really no emirated
7330800	7333360	characters in Nintendo's kind of lineup.
7333360	7337440	They're all kind of that, you know, family friendly type stuff.
7337440	7344720	Whereas you have Sweet Tooth versus Sackboy or Ratchet and Clank or something like that.
7345360	7346800	That just doesn't make any sense.
7346800	7350320	Now, I do have to say now they should be edgy with this.
7350320	7353840	They should really go all out with this kind of title fight thing.
7354880	7360560	I think they need to have, first off, Kevin Butler needs to be a playable character as
7360560	7365440	is also the creepy baby from their commercials needs to be a character as well.
7365440	7367120	And that would be awesome.
7369120	7374720	But yes, I wonder if they'll get any crossover things, you know, kind of like how they finally
7374720	7380480	got like Snake and Smash Brothers and Sonic and some of that.
7380480	7381600	You think any of that will happen?
7381600	7382720	That'd be kind of cool.
7382720	7383520	I mean, I don't know.
7383520	7389120	Maybe I could see them, you know, like doing like the like the commercial with like the
7389120	7391840	resistance people and the Call of Duty guys and stuff like that.
7391840	7392880	Maybe they'll have something like that.
7392880	7396320	And Bob or Mike or whatever his name was, Michael, dude.
7397920	7402160	Maybe your PlayStation home character, because God, I don't ever play that.
7402160	7405040	SSJ100Matt says, can we kill that Marcus PSP kid?
7406240	7407600	That would be hilarious.
7407600	7409920	But no, it's probably not going to be the case.
7409920	7410320	All right.
7411440	7414720	EA story, very controversial company these days.
7414720	7424720	Um, Eurogamer had a report this week that in the UK, EA person Keith Ramsdale, one of
7424720	7429120	the executives at EA announced that EA is going to develop an online universe for all
7429120	7430080	its franchises.
7430640	7435760	He didn't say like multiplayer necessarily, but a cross-platform major tie-in approach
7435760	7441440	to games and basically pulling in any gadget you can think of, iPhone, Xbox, whatever.
7441440	7442480	Football grenade.
7442480	7446720	Quote, imagine a player gets up in the morning, plays an online match on his 360 before going
7446720	7448720	to work on the bus, on his way to work.
7448720	7451680	He practices his free kicks on his tablet at lunch.
7451680	7454720	He looks on the transfer window on his PC on the way home.
7454720	7456480	He chooses his kit on the smartphone.
7456480	7457040	Here's the thing.
7457040	7461200	When he gets home to play again on his 360 that evening, all his accounts been hacked
7461200	7464160	and the people have charged FIFA DLC points.
7465280	7465600	All right.
7468640	7471600	All those achievements and upgrade will be alive in his game.
7471600	7472400	Here's the thing.
7472400	7472640	Okay.
7472640	7476160	So as much as EA is talking about this unified network, you know, I kind of thought this
7476160	7477280	was already happening.
7477280	7482080	And EA had a very our way or the highway mentality, and that's how they got away with a lot of
7482080	7483440	stuff on the Xbox.
7483440	7490160	I mean, even the way I bought Mass Effect 2 DLC, you kind of had to go online and tie
7490160	7492320	in the Cerberus account online.
7492320	7493440	And then that opens up the DLC.
7493440	7496640	I thought it was ridiculous, but EA is being very possessive about it.
7496640	7500080	Well, yeah, they wanted to go that way so that you have to buy your fucking online
7500080	7503920	passes for every game because they're like, shit, you know, this offline game, how are
7503920	7505360	we going to sell an online pass for it?
7505360	7508800	I mean, because, yeah, that may have worked once with Kingdoms of Amal or Reckoning, but
7508800	7512400	people are going to start figuring out that this game isn't online.
7512400	7514560	Why are they charging an online password?
7514560	7516960	So now they have to add their stupid little online component.
7516960	7519360	Really, all they're doing is just copying Call of Duty Elite.
7519360	7520960	I mean, that's what everybody's doing now.
7520960	7524000	I mean, that's what, you know, Rockstar is doing with...
7524000	7527920	Actually, to be fair, Rockstar kind of was doing it before Call of Duty Elite with their
7527920	7530800	social club stuff because they have that span across other games.
7530800	7532560	Then there's Ubisoft with their Uplay stuff.
7532560	7535840	I think they're doing something a little different with, like, I want to say it's their Ghost
7535840	7539520	Recon Network or something like that for the new Ghost Recon Future Soldier.
7539520	7541920	But then they have, you know, Call of Duty Elite.
7541920	7546000	They only have these different community things with apps and crap that you can tweak your
7546000	7546560	stuff in game.
7547600	7554960	Honestly, honestly, is it really going to take, what, like five seconds to configure
7554960	7558560	your fucking soccer player or whatever when you get home?
7558560	7560320	I mean, do you really have to bring...
7560320	7564240	Well, of course, I guess if you're this type of guy that brings your fucking tablet and
7564240	7570800	phone to work, you know, with you and shit, then I guess you want to, you know, get shit
7570800	7571760	done right away.
7571760	7574320	But I don't know.
7574320	7575440	I mean, it's a little excessive.
7576000	7578960	Cool if they're going to do that, but, you know, once again, I think it's just to sell
7578960	7580160	those online passes.
7580160	7586640	And, I mean, if it adds value, then neat, but, I don't know, they've kind of actually,
7586640	7588720	I think they've done that also with Need for Speed.
7588720	7591760	They had their auto log or something like that.
7592480	7595600	So, yeah, they're kind of already doing this.
7596720	7598000	That's the way everything's going.
7598000	7601520	They need to have some way to drive people to keep playing their games.
7602800	7604240	And not sell them used.
7604240	7604800	I guess.
7605440	7608640	All right, so you get to hear the same music, theme music again, because it doubles for
7608640	7610400	the mailbag music every week.
7610400	7614080	You guys send us emails at mailbag at orange launcher dot com and dark soccer dives into
7614080	7616480	the email bag head first and pulls out some emails.
7616480	7618800	She thinks she ought to share with the rest of us.
7620560	7622960	Um, no, this is from April 12th.
7622960	7624480	So disclaimers and everything.
7625520	7630800	Um, I haven't heard a lot about Assassin's Creed on the show, and I was wondering why
7630800	7633360	it isn't a big subject on, um, on here.
7633360	7634480	It's stellar series.
7634480	7638880	And I really think the story is underestimated by its gameplay being the main attraction.
7638880	7639920	What do you guys think?
7639920	7641520	There's another game series that I play.
7641520	7642320	I'm like, fuck this.
7642320	7643600	I'm not playing this anymore.
7643600	7643840	Really?
7643840	7644480	You didn't like it?
7644480	7645760	I didn't like Assassin's Creed.
7645760	7647280	I've heard a lot of good things about it.
7647280	7653040	Um, it's, it's kind of mass effect to me where I just, I saw it really quickly and I was
7653040	7656400	like, oh, I'm playing too much wow right now to get into Assassin's Creed.
7656400	7657920	I have a lot of friends that are really into it.
7657920	7663120	It is on my list to get to at some point, but you know, we can't play everything.
7663120	7668160	I'm actually interested in playing Assassin's Creed 2 just because I love, um, how fucked
7668160	7674720	up the Medici family was and it has a lot to do with, uh, Renaissance Italy at the time.
7675360	7678800	And it's funny, my Renaissance art history teacher, her daughter's playing the game
7679600	7684800	and, uh, she's, uh, you know, pointing out like the Palazzio and all these different
7684800	7686160	places and saying, oh yeah.
7686160	7690880	And so-and-so de Medici was killed here, you know, cause they're all busy popes and killing
7690880	7691440	each other.
7691440	7693520	I'm just saying.
7693520	7694240	Next email.
7694240	7695120	Oh, that was from Danny.
7695840	7696480	Next email.
7697200	7698320	Hey guys, Styrlok here.
7698320	7698960	Welcome back.
7698960	7702640	I was listening to some random video game soundtracks the other day and had an interesting
7702640	7705360	thought for a possible topic to talk about.
7705360	7707600	And I'm curious what your answer will be.
7707600	7712160	It seems that sometimes that random game will come along that completely sucks, but can
7712160	7714240	defy all logic by having a kick ass soundtrack.
7714800	7718720	The two that jumped to my mind right away are Unlimited Saga for PS2 and Spider-Man
7718720	7720640	and the X-Men arcades revenge on the SNES.
7720640	7724080	What games do you think of that will fit this criteria?
7724080	7726960	Obviously opinion based, but curious what you guys come up with.
7727520	7730400	I don't know why, but my mind goes very, very old school.
7730400	7732960	And one of the first games I think of was Goonies 2.
7733920	7737760	I don't know why the NES had a stellar soundtrack for the 8-bit days.
7737760	7738240	Oh yeah.
7738800	7740640	Actually, Dan really loves that game.
7740640	7745600	Yeah, but the game itself was, I mean, it takes some getting into, but then like once
7745600	7749680	you really do get into it, you're like, wow, this game, I don't give this game enough credit,
7749680	7751920	but that was really where the soundtrack was so good.
7751920	7753280	I had to like play more of it.
7754080	7759040	Well, I liked even, I'm not going to say it was a bad game, but it just wasn't that in
7759040	7759280	depth.
7759280	7759920	It wasn't that hard.
7759920	7765120	Strider 2 had a fantastic soundtrack, but really easy gameplay.
7765120	7767520	But for me, a lot of it was just how awesome the music was.
7767520	7769040	And oh my gosh, Strider, here are you.
7769040	7770400	I got a great answer for this.
7770400	7772160	Final Fantasy Mystic Quest.
7772160	7772640	Yeah.
7772640	7774480	It's kind of a crap RPG.
7775200	7775520	It's all right.
7775520	7778560	It's got a decent story, but the soundtrack was so good.
7778560	7780320	And it wasn't, it wasn't no Buimatsu either.
7780880	7783920	People are going to poop on me for this, but Paperboy.
7784960	7787120	I don't like Paperboy, but I love the music in it.
7789440	7789920	I can see that.
7791120	7792480	I just thought it was funny.
7792480	7793040	I can see that.
7793040	7793680	I am.
7793680	7795040	I really am not any good at Paperboy.
7795040	7796560	Paperboy is a weird ass game.
7796560	7797200	It is.
7797200	7799680	But I, I mean, I love watching other people play it.
7799680	7800160	That's the thing.
7800160	7801520	But I hate playing it myself.
7801520	7809200	Um, Agdeft and Artarum says, meh, Sonic games.
7809200	7811360	You know, Sonic Adventure 2 had a good soundtrack.
7811360	7812480	Anything you can think of, Loki?
7812480	7814320	A stall on the Sega Saturn.
7815440	7816560	That's a random pick.
7816560	7817120	Why that one?
7817120	7818320	A stall is kind of neat.
7818320	7818960	I love it.
7818960	7820560	It was, it was a great soundtrack.
7820560	7827200	I actually recorded on my cassette tape because I played the music on the Saturn when I rented
7827200	7828960	the console to play the game.
7829680	7830880	I have an answer for this.
7830880	7833440	It's going to get me a lot of shit, but you all know it's true.
7833440	7838480	This game actually isn't that good, but it's the soundtrack that keeps you coming back
7839120	7842720	because it wasn't as good on Xbox Live Arcade as it was on the Dreamcast.
7843840	7844960	Crazy Taxi.
7844960	7845520	Hell yeah.
7846880	7852720	But Crazy Taxi was kind of a crappy game, but it's that song.
7852720	7854800	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
7854800	7858400	Or the combination of Offspring and Bad Religion.
7858400	7864960	It just wasn't the same, which were two bands I was so into when that game came out.
7864960	7866400	I freaking love Bad Religion.
7867280	7871280	Um, God, there was another game that just popped into my head and then it popped out
7871280	7872640	the moment you said Crazy Taxi.
7872640	7879200	So, you know, I would say the PlayStation version of Grandia.
7880880	7884080	I tried, you know, I was playing it on the Genesis because the Genesis version is so
7884080	7887840	much better, but I still tried to play it on the PlayStation just so I could hear the
7887840	7888400	good music.
7888400	7889600	Hey, come on over.
7889600	7891600	Have some fun with Crazy Taxi.
7892400	7892880	Okay.
7892880	7897760	Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
7897760	7899200	Let's run over some bitches.
7900480	7902800	Hey, you're dragging too fast.
7902800	7903300	Shut up.
7904880	7906080	I know what I'm doing.
7909120	7912800	I mean, that song was already big before Crazy Taxi.
7912800	7914720	Like, I remember that song in high school and stuff.
7914720	7918720	And then, like, when that game came out, it was just like that game will forever be or
7918720	7920880	that song will forever be associated with Crazy Taxi.
7921440	7921680	Okay.
7921680	7925760	I know another game just because I liked the music in it, believe it or not.
7925760	7927200	Was that stupid Avatar game?
7929760	7931120	Yeah, you're on your own there.
7931120	7935520	And I was going back and watching the cut scenes from Tron Evolution and that was good
7935520	7936080	music.
7936080	7937120	No, I'll give you that.
7937120	7939680	Because, I mean, it was pretty much the Daft Punk stuff, but yeah.
7940240	7941040	All right.
7941040	7941600	More emails?
7942240	7942720	Yes.
7942720	7943040	Okay.
7943040	7946960	Um, let me go ahead and close the one from our friend, Strlock.
7948560	7949520	Hi, gang!
7949520	7950320	Hope you had an-
7950320	7952320	Hi, overexcited person!
7952320	7955520	Hope you had an awesome time in Electronica last week.
7955520	7955920	I did.
7956560	7957060	Bitch.
7958160	7959680	Thank you for my Duffy outfit.
7959680	7960180	You're welcome.
7960880	7964800	While you lot were having fun, I didn't get to go, so it was just while Rob was having
7964800	7969200	fun, I was forced to help my parents decide which of my childhood memories I wanted to
7969200	7971120	destroy for all time, hint none.
7971120	7973360	Good lord, this sounds like a terrible reality show.
7974960	7978560	While sorting through all my stuff, I found my old Master System 2.
7978560	7983440	Maybe because all the episodes of Game Center CX I've been watching, maybe it's the fact
7983440	7986480	that you mentioned Castle of Illusion last time, but I felt like I had to plug it in
7986480	7988560	and get me a fix of retro gaming.
7988560	7992160	I was surprised that it still works perfectly and that I still remembered how to plug it
7992160	7993600	in and tune the TV.
7993600	7997120	Flicking through channels and suddenly I saw the lo-fi Sega appear.
7997120	7998640	It's heartwarming experience.
7998640	8002080	Wait a minute, is Master System 2 what they call the Genesis overseas?
8002080	8004400	Uh, I don't know.
8005280	8008240	The Genesis was called the Mega Drive.
8008240	8009520	That's right, that's right.
8009520	8010480	It's like Castle of Illusion.
8010480	8011600	Was that on the Master System?
8012160	8013120	They did it in Brazil.
8013680	8014800	Oh, all right.
8014800	8019920	But anyway, um, I've never really been one for retro gaming.
8019920	8024320	I got MS2 pretty late and missed the 16-bit era entirely.
8024320	8028320	I never really grew up on video games in that way, but picking a game, blowing into the
8028320	8034560	cartridge and inserting it while imitating a Reno's Game Center CX kachow on was fun.
8034560	8036080	Of course I've never seen that show.
8036080	8039280	The games I used to play were pretty much exactly as I remembered them.
8039280	8041840	The fun, uncomplicated, and pretty tough.
8042560	8044640	They just all seemed charming.
8044640	8048880	The old school graphics, the epic music, all real undeniable charm.
8048880	8052000	The only thing I found surprising was how slow the games felt.
8052000	8053360	Sonic especially.
8053360	8056240	Maybe just a case of badly ported PAL games?
8056240	8060720	Unfortunately, I didn't get to spend too much time playing it, but I'd like to say it's
8060720	8067280	a pleasure, no, it's thanks to you guys and GCCX that I really had a renewed interest
8067280	8068400	in the pleasure of retro gaming.
8068400	8071200	Thanks, OLR, and that's from the OLR.
8072480	8076000	PS, when it comes to retro gaming, do you prefer playing old games on a modern console
8076000	8078240	is better than playing them on their original consoles?
8078240	8079760	PPS, bonus images for you.
8080880	8082240	This is, uh, Picaruno.
8082240	8091280	Um, I like to play retro games on newer consoles just because, you know, getting it on my new
8091280	8095760	TV and everything, it's really hard to hook up an Atari 2600 to a modern HDTV.
8095760	8097600	You kind of can't do it without converters.
8098960	8103520	You know, I saw his Twitter this week with all the, um, Sonic Chaos and all that.
8103520	8104000	R-Type.
8104000	8105520	Oh, I fucking love R-Type.
8106560	8107440	Good times.
8107440	8109200	No, I fucking love R-Type.
8109200	8111120	You want to talk about good video game music?
8111120	8112400	R-Type.
8112400	8115760	You need to find the opening music for R-Type for me right now, Rob, or I will cry.
8115760	8119600	You know, I forgot to mention in my games that I played in the last two weeks, but I
8119600	8123200	actually played through both, uh, Sexy Parodius and Parodius Da.
8123200	8124480	I love Parodius too.
8126320	8128240	Have you ever played Chatting Parodius?
8128240	8128740	No.
8129520	8130880	You should play Chatting Parodius.
8132320	8132800	Excuse me.
8132800	8134720	This may or may not be the song you were looking for.
8134720	8136320	I don't know this game as well as you do.
8136320	8137280	Nope, that's not.
8137280	8138000	Yep, that's his.
8138000	8141680	Wait, bitch, let it start before you make the call.
8150480	8151440	All right, I gotta watch how much-
8151440	8152240	Here we go, here's the part.
8156480	8159760	This is like my favorite piece of video game music ever.
8159760	8161840	We gotta watch how much of this we play on Ustream.
8161840	8164000	They have very- they have a zero tolerance on piracy.
8164000	8166320	Okay, well, it's on YouTube, so whatever.
8166320	8172480	Um, you know, I would actually have to say, and this is why Dan and I have such a big,
8173040	8179440	um, classic game console, uh, collection, is because we really do like playing them on
8179440	8180800	their intended consoles.
8181360	8185520	You know, I mean, sometimes I like going back and playing a few, you know, things on a newer
8185520	8189280	console if that, you know, happens to be what I have hooked up and say that, you know, oh,
8189280	8193840	the Neo Geo is at Dan's mom's house because we have a bunch of our game stuff in storage
8193840	8194720	at her place.
8194720	8200800	Well, I can't very well go grab the Neo Geo and play anything, so I guess I can play King
8200800	8203760	of Fighters on the Dreamcast or something.
8203760	8204560	You know, I'm just saying.
8205360	8209280	So it depends on convenience, but if I've got it there, I will hook up the old stuff
8209280	8209760	and play it.
8210640	8211600	Hail to the fuck yeah.
8212880	8214240	All right, is that it for the mailbag?
8214240	8215200	No, we have two more.
8215200	8215760	Oh my God.
8216560	8219520	Hey, we've been gone for two freaking weeks.
8219520	8220160	I guess that's true.
8220160	8224720	Hey, OLR, Defective Candy here, just emailing to announce my boyfriend or I are the new
8224720	8226800	proud parents of our only arcade cabinet.
8227440	8232240	I picked it up on Craigslist for $70, needed a little work, but the wood alone to build
8232240	8234000	one from scratch would have run us over $100.
8234720	8238480	We were thinking of turning it into a main cabinet, a PC based system that uses emulators.
8238480	8239120	Yes, we know.
8239760	8242320	Just because the game card is shot.
8242320	8246400	The original cabinet was from Data Pro, although I am unsure what game originally came with
8246400	8246560	it.
8246560	8248960	It had WWF Wrestlefest in it.
8248960	8250080	I remember that game.
8250080	8253200	I found out Data Pro was a large manufacturer of mostly pinball machines.
8253200	8255520	I was wondering if Dark Soccer was familiar with the brand.
8255520	8258720	I am familiar with them, but I don't think that they put out much that was good.
8258720	8259680	I can double check that.
8260320	8264240	I know it was Gottlieb that put out that TMNT table.
8264240	8264960	I'll have to check.
8266320	8269680	Anyway, I wanted to thank you guys for keeping me in the gaming world all these years and
8269680	8272240	inspire me to follow my dreams of buying my own cabinet.
8272240	8276160	I think the bug has really bitten us and we already went out to make a bar top cabinet
8276160	8278800	next and keep you updated on the status of our work.
8278800	8280000	Cheers, Defective Candy.
8280000	8281360	I want a bar top cabinet.
8281360	8281840	You know what?
8281840	8283200	They're more expensive than you think.
8283200	8284240	Here's the machine.
8286240	8287920	WWF Wrestlefest.
8287920	8289680	What a cheap piece of crap.
8289680	8292080	But it's your piece of crap and congratulations.
8292080	8292560	That's great.
8292560	8293200	And you know what?
8293200	8294640	That'll be great for the maim.
8294640	8297040	Exactly what Defective Candy is talking about in the email.
8297040	8298080	It'll be a great thing.
8298080	8300640	We built ours out of an old stand-up pole position.
8300640	8301280	Our last one.
8302160	8308480	Just be careful with what you're building your system out of because you need to have
8308480	8310000	the right graphics card for it.
8310000	8313680	I think, uh, there's drivers.
8313680	8314720	You can find the specs online.
8314720	8316480	Well, yeah, you can get special drivers.
8316480	8320560	Like, um, I have, uh, what do I have?
8320560	8326160	I ended up, before I was using an arcade VGA card, I recommend not going through that route
8326160	8329200	because the arcade VGA cards are usually a little bit old.
8329200	8331120	Although the newer ones though are newer models.
8331120	8337280	But I ended up going with an ATI card and then they have special drivers that you can
8337280	8342400	get that will do the low-res scaling for you.
8342400	8350320	And then also, um, you want to get the, uh, the JAMA adapter for, uh, the J-Pack.
8350320	8351280	J-Packs are awesome.
8351280	8352000	You need to get that.
8352880	8358160	And, uh, also be careful that you buy good buttons that won't wear out quickly.
8359280	8361200	For a cabinet like that, you don't need good buttons.
8361200	8362000	It doesn't matter.
8362000	8363840	I mean, the buttons are, like, so damn cheap.
8363840	8365760	They're like 50 cents.
8365760	8366720	Yeah.
8367920	8369840	Um, the last email.
8371040	8373680	Have any of you played Pier Solar?
8373680	8378320	It's an RPG created for the Sega Genesis but was originally released in 2008.
8378320	8382800	A reprint of the game recently sold out and they will probably release it again at some
8382800	8383440	point.
8383440	8387360	It's a really well-made game and does something no other Genesis game has done before that
8387360	8388240	I know of.
8388240	8392240	If you purchase the companion CD soundtrack, you can play the Genesis cart using the CD
8392240	8395680	soundtrack in the Sega CD drive for the in-game music.
8395680	8399840	The developer, Watermelon Games, is currently working on a new Genesis Mega Drive game,
8399840	8402640	so check out their website if you are interested.
8402640	8405760	Do you have any Genesis RPG recommendations?
8408240	8410480	Um, Fantasy Star 4?
8412320	8415600	Any of the Fantasy Stars, really, although that's kind of an obvious answer.
8415600	8418000	I- I don't remember this one.
8418000	8422320	I remember some of the Genesis games that came out later.
8422320	8426080	Bobby had had one of the folks on his show a few years ago.
8426080	8428960	Um, I don't remember that one, though.
8428960	8432800	It's awesome that people are still making games, though, for Genesis, but they still
8432800	8434880	do it for like Atari 2600 and all that.
8434880	8436000	Genesis RPGs?
8436000	8437520	I didn't own a Genesis growing up.
8437520	8438800	There's a website for it.
8438800	8441840	This is a really hard question for me because I didn't own a Genesis growing up.
8442400	8446240	Um, and my friends, you know, the games we would play would be Mortal Kombat because
8446240	8449200	it had the blood and Street Fighter Championship Edition.
8449200	8452800	Role-playing games on Genesis that weren't Fantasy Star.
8452800	8455120	Um, Dark Sakura?
8456000	8458560	Um, you know, I was a SNES person growing up.
8458560	8458880	Thank you.
8458880	8459600	Bobby reminded me.
8459600	8460800	It was called Beggar Prince.
8460800	8461200	Thank you.
8461200	8462080	I knew- I was like-
8462800	8467920	I- I grew up playing Chrono Trigger in the Final Fantasies, so- but, I mean, I've gone
8467920	8468160	back.
8468160	8477600	We picked up, um, the Sega Ages, uh, 2500 copy of, uh, Fantasy Star, which we had our
8477600	8480800	friend Krista translate for us while we were playing through it.
8480800	8485760	So, I mean, I- I never really got too much into the Genesis one.
8485760	8486160	Sorry.
8486160	8488400	I mean, I did play some of the Sega CD ones.
8488400	8493680	Like, it wasn't really an RPG, but I did play Popful Mail, you know, and I played Lunar.
8493680	8495840	I had those.
8495840	8496640	Lunar is awesome.
8499040	8499440	I don't know.
8500000	8504400	I didn't have a Genesis, not until long after Genesis was done.
8505440	8505680	Yeah.
8505680	8513760	And even then, it was just Sonic and Vectorman and-
8513760	8514960	Vectorman's pretty awesome.
8514960	8517120	I don't remember where the hell else we had.
8519920	8520320	What's that?
8520320	8520960	A big booger?
8521600	8522640	It's a chuzzle.
8522640	8522880	Oh.
8524160	8527760	I'm trying to entertain- since we're forced to use a- well, we're not really forced to
8527760	8531200	use a webcam on Ustream, but, you know, it's weird to not have one.
8531200	8534000	I've just been putting random objects in front of the camera because we're shy.
8534000	8535040	It's a radio show.
8535040	8537920	Well, I've got one more paragraph.
8537920	8538240	All right.
8538800	8540400	Good luck with the move to a new station.
8540400	8542800	Your fans will follow you, so don't worry about that.
8542800	8546160	Looking on the bright side, it sounds like Bobby will update his podcast feed, which
8546160	8547920	hasn't been done in a couple of years.
8547920	8548480	Yes!
8548480	8551760	This is a great opportunity for Bobby to turn over a new leaf.
8551760	8552080	Yes.
8552080	8553760	And that's by Will.
8553760	8556800	He sent a link, which I'm going to post in the chat room.
8556800	8558400	He must have just written that in the past hour.
8559120	8559360	Yeah.
8560080	8563040	Well, it was, you know, there as of part A, so.
8563040	8563520	There you go.
8563520	8566160	But it's a link to, uh, Pier Solar.
8566960	8567200	Awesome.
8567200	8569040	So I might have to give this a try.
8569040	8570960	There's a, is that a Pelican?
8570960	8571760	Looks like a Pelican.
8573120	8575040	All right, guys, let's move on.
8575040	8578720	Oh, mailbag, of course, at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the website.
8578720	8580720	If you want to send us your question for next week.
8580720	8582160	We had a lot of questions tonight.
8582720	8584560	Now it's not time for questions.
8584560	8594400	It's time for Angst and Destruction.
8604560	8605920	FUs of the Week, Dark Sakura.
8605920	8614240	Um, FU being tired and having people not really understand the way that good design works.
8615200	8618240	Um, committees, just committees.
8618240	8620160	They should just let me do everything and take it.
8620720	8624640	Um, also one on behalf of Becky, because I'm pissed off for her.
8625760	8630880	Um, fuck those little things that try to put you into a category and then her teacher for
8630880	8632320	making her write about it.
8632320	8634400	Because I'm pissed off that she has to do it.
8634400	8637920	I've come up with interesting titles for her papers, including Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans.
8640320	8645520	And, um, my, uh, suggestion to her for the summary of her essay is in summary, fuck you.
8646560	8646960	Just saying.
8649040	8649600	Logie?
8649600	8655760	Fucking to myself for letting my backyard get so overgrown that I can only, like, not
8655760	8656480	even really mow.
8656480	8665280	I should say hack through with, uh, a mower, you know, weed whacker and various other tools.
8665280	8670880	I can only get about most of my side yard done before I filled up two trash cans full
8670880	8673040	of grass and vines.
8673680	8674800	It is a jungle out there.
8676640	8680320	Um, I'm going to give an FU to the fact that here we are trying to do our last show on
8680320	8683360	all games and there isn't an all game server tonight, but whatever.
8683360	8684560	These things happen.
8684560	8687920	It's just always seems to happen at key times.
8687920	8692320	Um, but I will, um, say, you know, I'm going to say a thank you for the listener that says
8692320	8692880	we don't do enough.
8692880	8693840	Thank you is during the FUs.
8693840	8701120	I'm going to say a thank you to all of the folks, live listeners, um, for being really
8701120	8704160	understanding in light of the difficult announcement we made tonight.
8704160	8709200	I feel a lot of love and a lot of support, and that wasn't an easy thing that, you know,
8709200	8711920	we, we've had to keep it under wraps for a long time.
8711920	8714480	And you know, there's a sense of guilt that comes with that.
8714480	8717120	Um, but thank you guys for understanding.
8717120	8718560	It's, it's, um, awesome.
8718560	8719680	You guys are great.
8719680	8723440	And next week, hopefully our, our new server won't go down.
8724400	8724800	We'll see.
8725360	8727280	Anyway, uh, that's it for FUs.
8727280	8732160	Let's get into a few more stories and then Twitter topics at twitter.com slash O L R.
8732160	8734000	Uh, just a few of those Skypline.
8734000	8735520	We've got to do Skypline as well.
8735520	8737520	Um, so let's try to run through these last few stories.
8737520	8740160	So we have time for a couple of Skype calls cause I know people want to get in tonight.
8741040	8741360	Okay.
8741360	8747120	So Nintendo has made a patent for game emulation on low capacity systems.
8747680	8753040	Basically, um, some sort of device that, you know, they have, it looks like in an airplane
8753040	8757920	or something like that, where somebody is playing, uh, some sort of game or something
8757920	8758960	on the back of a chair.
8758960	8763840	So basically like an arm device or something like that, that would emulate Game Boy, Game
8763840	8768720	Boy Color, Game Boy Advance games, um, systems like cell phones and stuff like that.
8768720	8774560	Funny because that already exists, you know, as emulators on said pretty much every platform
8774560	8778800	known man, but now they're making it official, I guess that they're going to do some sort
8778800	8784880	of emulators, which points more towards, you know, you know, having some sort of software
8784880	8789920	that runs on those, you know, buy all the old shit all over again, of course played
8789920	8791840	in it.
8791840	8795600	I like how they're all, you can play them in the back of like airplane seats or on my
8795600	8800400	phone that I have or my game device or my tablet or what about, you know, whatever else
8800400	8802000	because they have emulators for everything.
8803440	8804000	Computer.
8805840	8806240	All right.
8806240	8812000	Um, LOL lawsuits, Ubisoft and game trailers were sued this week over Assassin's Creed.
8812000	8815440	There's for that email earlier and Assassin's Creed copyright.
8815440	8823200	Apparently Assassin's Creed stole core ideas from, um, John Bestwinger's novel Link.
8823200	8828960	Link was published in 20 or excuse me, 2002 Assassin's Creed first came out in 2007.
8828960	8829840	Now, yes, that's right.
8829840	8833920	I said he's suing Ubisoft and game trailers now.
8833920	8834240	Okay.
8834240	8837760	If you think somebody bit off your game, I get the Ubisoft lawsuit, right?
8837760	8843200	They, they publish the game and okay, I get that because apparently in the novel link,
8844960	8850400	his novel discusses assassinations and has spiritual and biblical tones similar to those
8850400	8851760	in Assassin's Creed.
8851760	8858000	There's also a battle between good and evil that was stolen right out of every other book.
8859440	8866240	Apparently the link device is where users access ancestral memories and relive specific
8866240	8870560	moments in history, much as the animus in Assassin's Creed does.
8871520	8872800	I've never heard that plot.
8872800	8876720	I came out with a book with fantasy characters and there's elves in it.
8876720	8880400	I want my money, but this is great.
8880400	8882160	By the estate of Tolkien will sue you.
8882160	8888960	The guy is suing game trailers because of the trailers that infringe on the copyright.
8889680	8893840	So just for hosting the trailer to Ubisoft's game, game trailers has been looped down.
8893840	8894400	They're not good.
8894400	8896160	And that's where this thing went from.
8896160	8898560	Okay, well maybe too fucking absurd.
8900080	8903200	Like what kind of 1-800 lawyers representing you here?
8903200	8906080	5.25 million dollars in damages.
8906080	8909840	Cessation of further copyright infringement.
8910880	8914160	The fact you're suing game trailers says you have no idea how the internet works.
8914160	8914560	Goodbye.
8916080	8918560	Are we going to get sued for mentioning it on the show?
8918560	8919440	Oh, Freedom of Press.
8919440	8920160	Nope, can't do that.
8920960	8921680	Commentary.
8922880	8924000	Anyhow, Dark Soccer.
8925200	8930640	Well, there is going to be Silent Hill Revelation 3D.
8930640	8931200	Yay!
8931200	8932720	And it's going to be in the theaters.
8932720	8933220	Yay!
8933220	8936900	October 26th, which is my brother's birthday.
8936900	8937460	Just saying.
8938740	8941140	I am so excited.
8942340	8945860	But it will have Sean Bean and Carrie Ann Moss.
8946660	8949460	And it will sort of follow Silent Hill 3.
8950420	8954180	Just that it's got Heather Mason in it and their stuff.
8954180	8956740	I find it fascinating it's most of the same cast from the first movie.
8956740	8959060	That's great that they were able to get them all to come back.
8959060	8959940	Yeah, I think that's cool.
8959940	8961700	Will Sean Bean die because he dies and everything?
8961700	8963700	I was just going to say that.
8963700	8964340	Oh, sorry.
8965780	8966500	But, um...
8966500	8967300	Don't sue me.
8967300	8970660	But apparently it's going to have, um, Akira Yamaoka's music again.
8971860	8974100	And, uh, I'm excited.
8974100	8975700	I am super, super excited.
8975700	8980180	But it doesn't say who, uh, it means I'm going to have to go on the wiki now to see, um,
8980180	8983060	who actually directed it because I don't think it's, uh, Gons this time.
8986340	8988020	DJ Morpheus in the chat room.
8988020	8992500	Ann Rice came up with Overly Gay Vampires first, but no suit against Twilight.
8993780	8994820	Okay, I'm on the IMDB.
8994820	8996500	I should be offended, but I'm totally not.
8996500	8997060	That's great.
8997060	8998660	Okay, I'm on the, uh, IMDB.
8999860	9002740	And, uh, it said, God, no, it won't load.
9002740	9003540	Okay.
9003540	9005780	Does this mean, does this mean OLR field trip?
9005780	9006100	Yes.
9006100	9006580	To the movies?
9006580	9008180	OLR Night at the Movies movie date?
9008180	9009300	Michael J. Bassett.
9009300	9011300	Will Dark Soccer and I share a popcorn?
9011300	9012260	I don't need popcorn.
9013140	9014100	I don't need corn!
9014100	9017940	Well, Loki and I share popcorn.
9017940	9018820	You and I, we can share.
9018820	9020420	No, I'm not sharing.
9020420	9023380	Rob Junior Mintz.
9023380	9025780	All right, we'll share Junior Mintz.
9025780	9029140	I just want an excuse to put my hand in the box at the same time we hold hands.
9029700	9034500	Oh, but it's directed and written by Michael J. Bassett and another person.
9034500	9037460	This is Kit Harrington, who I have no idea who that is.
9038500	9042260	Some dude whose mom's name is Deborah.
9042260	9044740	Oh, he's, he's in Game of Thrones.
9044740	9046340	No wonder, cause I don't watch that stupid show.
9046980	9049460	What's, um, I'm not going to go into it.
9049460	9052420	I just, I happen to know a lot of people really love that show.
9052420	9052900	I haven't watched it.
9052900	9055540	I'm going to say what I've told lots of people.
9055540	9057940	I don't give a shit if you like it.
9058500	9060180	Don't tell me how good it is.
9060180	9061060	I don't care.
9061620	9062660	It says nothing.
9062660	9064100	It's a really good series.
9064660	9065300	Fuck off.
9065300	9066420	Dan likes it.
9066420	9068980	And this is what I, this is what I have to say.
9068980	9073860	I have to say, just because I don't like something that you like, doesn't mean I'm making a statement
9073860	9075540	about you don't take it personally.
9075540	9077060	Or that it's bad necessarily.
9077700	9080020	Yeah, it's just not something I'm into.
9080020	9082580	And it has nothing to do with my opinion of you.
9083140	9088420	If I know that you like it, then I will be quiet and not, you know, shit talk it in front of you
9088420	9090260	out of respect for my friendship with you.
9090260	9092660	But if I don't like it, I'm not going to hide that I don't like it.
9092660	9095620	A lot of people might think Supernatural is the dumbest thing on TV.
9095620	9096820	And they're entitled to that.
9096820	9097460	Don't tell me.
9097460	9099140	I don't care.
9099140	9101860	All right, moving on.
9103620	9106340	You know how it is when you say, oh, I kind of don't like this.
9106340	9107540	And everyone jumps on you.
9107540	9108260	Why don't you like it?
9108260	9109060	It's the best thing ever.
9110180	9111780	I'm offended that you don't like it.
9111780	9114500	That's how I feel when people tell me they don't like RuPaul's Drag Race.
9114500	9118340	It's like, okay, hate on Ru all you want because Fifi O'Hara is in the final three.
9118340	9120740	But seriously, it's the best fucking show on TV.
9120740	9121140	Shut up.
9122020	9123140	But you know what I mean?
9123140	9128100	When people take their shit personally, and it's not something to do personally.
9129780	9131700	Black Wolf says I take it personally.
9131700	9134340	Legend of Zaku says King Joffrey will have Jamie's head.
9137140	9139620	What, after he gets stabbed sitting on his chair of swords?
9140260	9140900	I don't know.
9140900	9141540	I don't care.
9141540	9143060	That's what I call it behind everyone's back.
9143060	9143860	A chair of swords.
9144580	9145140	Right.
9145140	9146740	Moving on so we can get to calls.
9146740	9147240	Loki.
9147240	9154360	So, thank you Sega for thinking outside the box with your toilet games.
9154360	9158440	And now this Super Monkey Ball for the Vita.
9158440	9159640	It's already out in Japan.
9159640	9165240	And for a limited time, Sega is offering adult map download codes for those who purchase the game.
9165800	9169240	And what exactly is that, you may ask?
9169240	9179160	Well, it is featuring Bikini Model, Yuki Kamamura, and well, you have to roll over her breasts
9179160	9182520	that protrude all over the place on the map.
9183080	9186600	Yes, it's like those wonderful mouse pads that you can buy.
9186600	9191160	You must navigate your monkey ball over a field of breasts.
9192600	9193160	Well played.
9194840	9195480	Well played.
9195480	9198200	Boobies.
9201160	9203960	I just want to know if it's going to start a new fetish of some type.
9203960	9204760	And I worry.
9204760	9206280	I worry for the future.
9206280	9207400	I think it's awesome.
9207400	9211080	Well, actually, if you remember, Super Monkey Ball was supposed to have it where you can
9211080	9213080	actually create maps based off a picture.
9213080	9218360	So if you took a picture of a banana, it would create a banana shaped map.
9218360	9220840	So what is the TTP for that game?
9221640	9223640	How long before we have penis shaped maps?
9223640	9232280	A half a second, two seconds, a millisecond, a millisecond.
9232280	9232840	All right.
9232840	9235960	Instants are instantaneous.
9236840	9241800	One toa gak in the chat room says, so you move your balls over the boobs?
9242840	9244040	Yes, just like that.
9245400	9246920	All right, one more story for you guys.
9246920	9253080	And guys, we have to end on a good note tonight because this is like a game where you have
9253080	9255720	this is like the hero of the gaming industry this week.
9255720	9256520	And we have to end.
9256520	9258040	You know, we talk a lot of shit.
9258040	9261880	You know, we commentate a lot on this and sometimes have a very cynical attitude.
9261880	9265640	But this guy deserves a fucking round of applause.
9265640	9269000	And we're going to end by tipping our hats to this man tonight.
9269000	9269560	Who is it?
9270440	9272520	Katsuhiro Harada.
9272520	9273320	Do you know that name?
9274200	9275960	You would if you're a fan of Tekken.
9275960	9277720	He's the Tekken series producer.
9277720	9278760	Totally love.
9279960	9281880	And why is he our hero this week?
9281880	9283720	Because he's a pimp.
9283720	9287480	He talked to Edge Online, who apparently has been getting a lot of people this week in
9287480	9293960	interviews, and he says, well, he didn't say if you are worried about what Capcom is doing,
9293960	9295160	then don't worry about this.
9295160	9302200	But he did basically say no Tekken game will ever have DLC characters at all.
9302200	9310440	Bravo, bravo, bravo, I tip my hat.
9312280	9315240	No Tekken game will ever have DLC characters at all.
9315240	9317640	Too bad Tekken 6 was shit, but we forgive you.
9318520	9322280	We forgive you and stand by your amazing statement.
9323800	9330040	Now, before you get too excited, he did say vanity items might be added to the game after
9330040	9331320	the fact and would have a charge.
9331320	9335400	Like, you know, alternate costumes and, you know, preorder bonuses for that.
9335400	9339080	But no DLC characters, which is good enough for me.
9339080	9342200	If people want to play Barbie with their characters and that costs money, then fine.
9342200	9344120	But no DLC characters.
9344120	9344920	Thank you.
9344920	9345560	You know what?
9345560	9347160	Make sure Tekken 7 is a good game.
9347160	9347960	You know what's funny?
9348520	9350680	You're talking about playing Barbies with the characters.
9350680	9353160	Dan was really into Dead or Alive beach volleyball.
9353880	9355560	And he would be like, look at this outfit.
9355560	9357240	And I'm like, oh, you're being such a girl.
9357960	9358520	I love it.
9358520	9359000	I love it.
9359000	9361720	I don't think that's what he was referring to as far as look at this outfit.
9361720	9364280	It's more like, look at how small this outfit is.
9366200	9370360	It would just be funny to think about how he got these different outfits.
9370360	9371000	And I was like, oh.
9372360	9373320	Skype line's open.
9373320	9375160	1877 game OLR.
9375160	9377560	Our username on Skype is orange lounge radio.
9377560	9378120	Give us a call.
9378120	9379720	We got time for a couple of quick calls tonight.
9379720	9383960	We're running a little long due to the earlier announcement that caused Bobby to run long.
9383960	9386600	But we will try to squeeze in a few calls here.
9386600	9390760	Again, 1877 game OLR, our username on Skype, orange lounge radio.
9390760	9392600	In the meantime, let me try to get to some tweets.
9392600	9398360	I don't have a whole lot of time, but I'm going to get to these as fast as I can here.
9400360	9402920	Dark Tetsuya wants to remind everybody about the hunt.
9404360	9407480	Thank you, Dark Tetsuya, for putting that on at orange lounge radio.com.
9407480	9411800	I apologize that things have been kind of going to the back burner in spite of everything
9411800	9415480	else going on with the announcements and things like that.
9415480	9417960	But if you haven't checked it out, it's a fun little competition.
9417960	9420920	Dark Tetsuya's trying to get the little scoreboard and get people into it.
9420920	9421800	It's really cute.
9421800	9423480	Check that out at orange lounge radio.com.
9424040	9426360	Piece of advice, don't get eaten by a grue.
9426360	9429480	So you can guess where the next challenge is probably going.
9429480	9430920	In the meantime, let's go to some calls.
9430920	9431960	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9431960	9432360	Who's this?
9432920	9433560	Hey, hey, hey.
9433560	9434200	It's Ranma.
9434200	9434920	Hey, hey, hey.
9434920	9435320	What's up?
9436200	9437240	Not a lot.
9437240	9441240	A couple of things I wanted to discuss in regards to Paxis because I didn't get a chance
9441240	9442200	to all last time.
9442200	9442700	Yeah.
9442700	9445580	But before that, I just have one thing to say to you, Rob.
9445580	9446080	Yep.
9447820	9451900	In the time I've listened to the show, you've worked your ass off.
9451900	9454140	You've delivered so much.
9454780	9457660	So I don't care what you say.
9458700	9461340	You earned that diva fit you made.
9461340	9462700	You earned that.
9464780	9469740	I mean, for what you give back and for that one person to say something for you to fly
9469740	9471900	off the handle like that, you earned it.
9471900	9475260	This is four-year-old news, Ranma.
9475260	9477500	This is, we're over it.
9477500	9481020	That'll probably, you know what's funny in light of all the news tonight about all games
9481020	9485900	and everything, that'll probably end up being the big highlight of OLR on the All Games
9485900	9486400	Network.
9487180	9490620	And between me and Misty, one of us has that episode on our hard drives.
9490620	9491260	Oh, great.
9492540	9495900	Misty's getting a present when she comes out here for the 10-year show, by the way.
9495900	9496460	Oh, wow.
9496460	9497740	Shit, was I supposed to say that on air?
9497740	9498540	Oh, well, oops, I did.
9498540	9501260	I found some old episodes.
9502940	9504140	So, all right.
9504940	9508140	Anyhow, what did you really want to tell us tonight, Ranma, about PAX East?
9508140	9510140	Just a couple of quick things.
9510140	9515660	One thing was, you know, the portable game, the portable console lounge?
9516860	9517360	Yeah.
9517820	9521580	And a lounge full of 3DSs, the Vita stands alone.
9522620	9522940	Really?
9522940	9525500	Like nobody brought Vitas or what happened?
9525500	9528620	It was like one or two people with Vitas.
9528620	9534220	It was like for every 10 3DSs you saw, you probably saw maybe one person with a Vita.
9534780	9535500	You know what, though?
9535500	9538940	It's everybody's trying to street pass, and everybody's trying to clear their queue
9538940	9540140	for Find Me and everything.
9540140	9543820	I gotta say, I got a shit ton of street passes at Disneyland this week when I was there.
9543820	9549820	And yeah, I was able to get all the way to the second to last boss and Find Me 2.
9549820	9554220	And let me tell you, there's some real bullshit that happens in Find Me 2.
9554220	9555820	Can I just say?
9555820	9557180	Who are you trying to kid?
9557180	9557680	Anyway.
9559820	9561420	No, no, I agree with you about Find Me 2.
9561420	9562780	I'm like, who are you trying to kid?
9562780	9564780	I know, it's kind of getting to the point where it's bullshit.
9564780	9569740	But I will say this, I did also finish the Kid Icarus puzzle in the little swap puzzle thing.
9570460	9573740	That's a pretty sweet little 3D image that it's like in motion.
9574700	9577980	I finished that when I'm still trying to finish up the rest of the puzzles
9577980	9584620	as I continue to street pass every single day to and from work.
9584620	9586220	There's actually something I was wondering about.
9586220	9586700	What's that?
9586700	9591980	With the lenticular photos that the 3DS takes, Dan's phone takes lenticular photos as well.
9592540	9595340	I wonder if they would be readable by each other's...
9595340	9596060	You might.
9596060	9597660	See what kind of file format it does.
9597660	9599420	See if you can put it on the web especially.
9599420	9603020	If it can go on the web and then you can see it in the 3DS browser, it might work.
9603020	9603660	It probably would.
9604220	9605180	It just depends on the full frame.
9605180	9605900	It just occurred to me.
9605900	9607500	Hmm, play around with that.
9608620	9610060	Well, anything else, Rama?
9610060	9615100	Well, I was telling Jamie this last night, but as you know,
9615100	9617980	the big thing about PAX is the Omega-Thon, right?
9617980	9618480	Oh yeah.
9619180	9623900	Well, I am proud to say that one of my very good friends, Tina Lamb,
9624940	9631020	if I'm not mistaken, first female gamer to make it to the finals of the Omega-Thon.
9631020	9631660	Good for her.
9631660	9632220	Did she win?
9633260	9635100	No, she came in second place.
9635100	9638860	I had a feeling because you would have said the first female winner of the Omega-Thon
9638860	9639980	if that was the case.
9639980	9640780	Yeah, that's too bad.
9641580	9645900	Wasn't the last game like some type of old school board game with the pucks?
9647180	9648940	That's what I thought I heard somewhere.
9648940	9653820	Yeah, and on the ride back from PAX, my Twitter feed was blowing up because
9653820	9655260	she goes by the name of Porkbun.
9655260	9658700	So we were like, go team Porkbuns, you can do it Porkbuns.
9658700	9662860	We were just like going nuts, just rooting for her because we wanted her to win.
9662860	9665740	But since she came in second from what I was told,
9666300	9669420	her and her partner are coming back next year to compete again.
9670060	9671820	Oh, oh, that's right.
9671820	9673580	The runner-up always gets to compete again.
9673580	9674300	That's right.
9674300	9675180	I've heard that before.
9676700	9677180	Well, good.
9677980	9680220	And I told Jamie last night, I figured she would like,
9680220	9682380	she would love to hear an awesome story like that.
9684380	9686460	Well, one day, I think that we should interview her.
9686460	9688220	One day, maybe Dark Soccer should be in the final.
9688220	9689340	Yeah, we'd love to interview her.
9689340	9689660	Why not?
9689660	9690540	It'd be fun.
9690540	9691820	Well, I'll see what I can do.
9691820	9692860	Yeah, it'd be great.
9692860	9693340	I'd love that.
9694780	9695420	All right.
9695420	9698140	Well, Rama, I got to let you go because we got a lot of calls trying to come in.
9698140	9699340	So I'll talk to you later.
9699340	9699900	Okay, buddy.
9699900	9700140	All right.
9700140	9700940	Take care, bro.
9700940	9701980	Stay fabulous.
9701980	9702620	Of course.
9703580	9704460	All right.
9704460	9708380	1-877-GAMO-LR or use your name on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
9708380	9710060	Getting you some tweets real quick here.
9710700	9712460	TigerClaw sends us a couple of tweets.
9712460	9716060	Sony wants MMO players to meet each other in real life.
9716060	9716380	What?
9717820	9719020	Because that always goes well.
9719020	9719180	Yeah.
9719180	9720540	Well, I mean, there's been Blizzcons.
9720540	9724220	There's been Final Fantasy XI fan appreciation events or whatever.
9724220	9725100	So why not?
9725100	9726140	Some other type of thing.
9726140	9727820	But it's not what you think.
9727820	9732620	Because what this really is, it's a patent that streamlines the process where online
9732620	9735580	friends in an MMO can meet up in the real world and become friends.
9737100	9740940	I guess the technology is aimed at getting them together at marketing events.
9741500	9744700	You get in-game incentives to go to real world events.
9744700	9750380	I guess that's kind of what you do with, like, the DS.
9750380	9752780	Go to a Starbucks and get the Nintendo Zone or whatever.
9752780	9753820	It's just like with Nier.
9753820	9755420	That's all they're doing is Nier stuff.
9755420	9756540	Oh, that makes sense.
9756540	9756940	All right.
9757580	9758140	Oh, that is.
9758140	9759820	That is kind of like the same thing as Nier.
9759820	9762700	I wonder if the Vita could facilitate that transfer.
9763260	9764940	Maybe I'm thinking a little highbrow.
9764940	9765340	I don't know.
9767100	9768140	Let's go to another call.
9768700	9769740	Hi, you're on OrangeLoungeRadio.
9769740	9770300	Who's this?
9770300	9772140	Oh, it's Legend of Zaku.
9772140	9773420	Hey, Zaku.
9773420	9774940	I can see Zaku tonight.
9774940	9775740	What is up with this?
9776620	9779020	Because I'm on my Mac, my monitor died tonight.
9779020	9780860	So yeah, I have a backup.
9780860	9785340	I would put you on the Ustream if I knew how, but I wasn't prepared to go video tonight.
9785340	9786380	So whatever.
9786380	9787260	What's on your mind, buddy?
9788380	9789100	Nothing much.
9789100	9794780	Just like catching up on gaming and the, you know, HBO going 360 for non-gaming stuff.
9794780	9796940	But yeah, mostly League of Legends and Battlefield.
9797660	9801660	But yeah, it's been either of those two games.
9801660	9807900	And going on what I've seen in PAX, like in the Portable Gaming Lounge, I'm pretty certain,
9807900	9813340	I think Adam was right, aside, well, Rama was right in the sense that, yeah, there probably
9813340	9818140	was a little bit more of a lopsided towards 3DSs.
9819020	9823580	I mean, don't get me wrong, the Vita's pretty good, especially for Lumines.
9823580	9830300	But it's like, I would also imagine that not only 3DS would have to, you know, compete
9830300	9833740	against the same space as folks with iPhones that I saw over there.
9833740	9835820	Nier isn't also quite the same thing.
9835820	9838540	Like Nier isn't the same as that 3DS StreetPass.
9838540	9842220	And I seriously think a lot of those people were just trying to like, I never get to StreetPass
9842220	9842780	with people.
9842780	9846700	I have never, ever played Find Me, you know, like, because, you know, a lot of people don't
9846700	9847980	take their DSs with them everywhere.
9847980	9850620	But a convention like PAX is a great place to do it.
9850620	9855100	Even then, there were still folks on their iPads playing, you know, all the other types
9855100	9861500	of iPad games, you know, not included, you know, not limited to Angry Birds, but...
9861500	9864220	They were just showing off that they had the fancy new ones.
9864220	9866540	Yeah, they had their iPads or their tablets.
9867180	9874300	But it was pretty much like, obviously, the 3DS was like the only traditional game, portable
9874300	9877420	game console that was represented, but everything else was still mobile.
9877420	9882540	Like, I even had the chance to break out my, you know, my phone for a bit, but, you know,
9882540	9884380	battery was getting there.
9884380	9890620	But you get the idea that it's not just 3DS anymore when you have, like, when you have
9890620	9891580	mobile, especially...
9892380	9893100	I'm trying to remember.
9895340	9900540	I think it was, I forgot which one from Nintendo actually said that he actually liked Angry
9900540	9901020	Birds.
9902140	9902540	I thought...
9903740	9907100	I do remember you reading that same quote, something about, you know, like, kind of tipping
9907100	9909900	the hats of the competition that angry birds ain't that bad.
9909900	9914620	And yet he goes against the wishes of his boss who basically throws it, who basically
9914620	9918460	chides Angry Birds for basically going after their bread and butter.
9918460	9919660	Yeah, but you know he's played it.
9920940	9926860	Yeah, but it's like, I guess Nintendo didn't keep these, you know, I don't know if they're
9926860	9932300	keeping their guys on a PR leash, but that's kind of damaging if the official part, the
9932300	9935660	official company line is like, we hate casual gamers.
9935660	9939500	Anything outside of, we hate casual developers.
9939500	9944220	The guys who, you know, work, you know, the guys who create Angry Birds or any other...
9944220	9946460	I don't think Nintendo hates casual gamers.
9946460	9949100	Look at what we just talked about tonight.
9949100	9951340	Mario 2, who's that really aimed at?
9951340	9954620	You know, it's kind of, it's a hot podge of the casual and the hardcore market.
9954620	9956540	It's, you know, the Nintendo fan market.
9956540	9960940	It's like that whole platform where people could just, you know, buy like a developer
9960940	9969900	license for two, you know, developer, an iPhone developer account for 200 bucks and make an
9969900	9973820	app that they sell for two bucks a pop and make like, you know, hundreds of thousands
9973820	9974860	in profits.
9974860	9980060	Where meanwhile, folks who are doing the same for 3DS have to go through the licensing fees
9980060	9982860	and they're lucky to even, you know, to break even.
9982860	9986940	I guess my point is that with these platforms that have very little overhead, it's a lot
9986940	9992220	easier to create breakout hits for audiences that Nintendo may or may not pick up due to
9992220	9995180	the, due to them not taking that many risks.
9995180	10001580	I cannot, you know, go back to the fact that I hate to say this, but most of the Japanese
10001580	10004460	developers are not that much of a risk taker.
10004460	10004780	Whereas...
10004780	10005340	That is true.
10005340	10006860	What did we just talk about with Konami?
10006860	10007500	Absolutely.
10008300	10013580	I mean, whereas the Western counterparts, at least they understand that if they don't
10013580	10018140	innovate or they don't take risks, they're pretty much, they're dead in the water.
10018140	10020860	And some have, some have lost big, unfortunately.
10020860	10023420	And that's why we hear about these studio closures and so on.
10023420	10026940	Sako, I got to let you go so we can get some more calls, but I'm glad you had a good time
10026940	10027500	PAX East.
10027500	10028540	We'll hopefully see you next year.
10029100	10029820	Definitely.
10029820	10030380	Later, buddy.
10031740	10033420	That's always fun to get video.
10033420	10034620	1877 game.
10034620	10037820	Well, you know, I have an option on here to answer with video on Skype, but they would
10037820	10040140	just see our little chuzzles that we're showing on Ustream.
10040940	10042300	I don't want to break Ustream either.
10042300	10043420	So, all right.
10043420	10044700	Anyhow, 1877 game.
10044700	10047100	OLR username is coming in, but there's a call coming in right now.
10047100	10048300	So let me go to it.
10048300	10049420	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10049420	10049980	Who's this?
10049980	10050780	Sold.
10050780	10051580	Oh, thank God.
10051580	10052140	It's Porkchop.
10052140	10052940	How you doing?
10052940	10053900	Hey, Porkchop.
10053900	10054700	What is up?
10054700	10056620	Yeah, I've been trying to get through all night.
10056620	10060540	I lost the shoutcast feed, so I have to switch between Ustream.
10060540	10062220	I'm doing everything on my Android.
10062220	10064860	So it's good to finally actually get through and start talking.
10064860	10065340	So...
10065340	10068300	Yeah, what happened wasn't ideal, unfortunately, but it is what it is.
10068300	10069100	We all, but...
10069100	10072700	Yeah, I know you guys are having the night from hell and it's supposed to be really nice
10072700	10074540	since you're kind of moving on and that kind of thing.
10074540	10076540	So it's got to be a pain in the ass.
10076540	10077900	Yeah, it is what it is.
10077900	10081980	You know, the beautiful thing is, you know, we still have a fair amount of people connected
10081980	10082780	to the Ustream.
10082780	10086140	You know, it might not be quite as many as are usually there on all games, but we have
10086140	10088860	a pretty fair amount, you know, connected right now.
10088860	10093420	And that just shows that even in a night, our listeners are so awesome that they would
10093420	10096220	just like follow us to, oh shit, the stream, go to Ustream?
10096220	10097100	All right, we're there.
10097100	10101500	And look at you, you're like juggling your Android and you're trying to go to Ustream
10101500	10103180	back and forth just so you can call.
10103180	10103740	It's great.
10103740	10105900	And it's not the case tonight, it's the morning.
10105900	10107260	It's like five o'clock here.
10107260	10111340	I have a lot to do tomorrow, but I decided to, you know, dedicate it at this stage.
10111340	10113100	I really enjoy the station, so...
10113100	10114380	You guys are dedicated.
10114380	10115580	Yeah, why not?
10115580	10118780	I wish I could tell you that the show was going to be on earlier in the future, but
10118780	10120220	that's not the case, I'm sorry to say.
10120780	10121500	I don't care.
10121500	10121980	I love it.
10121980	10122860	I'm still listening.
10122860	10128540	And I actually wanted to say that, you know, I was going to ask, what was so bad about
10128540	10129260	Tekken 6?
10129260	10131100	I mean, it wasn't all that bad of a game.
10131100	10134380	Apart from the whole, it's been chopped and changed a bit.
10134380	10138540	I can understand that you don't have, you know, go get your characters anymore.
10138540	10139740	But I actually enjoyed it.
10139740	10144300	I'm just wondering, and I know Dark Sakura, you make a good point in saying, you know,
10144300	10146700	oh, jump on it if people kind of make a thing about it.
10146700	10147740	I'm not being like that.
10147740	10152060	I'm just wondering what you thought was actually, could have been better about it, I guess.
10152060	10156540	If, to be fair, I may not have given it the best chance, to be fair, because Alan and
10156540	10158780	I rented it from, you know, one of the online games.
10158780	10159820	Come here, Alan.
10159820	10161100	What didn't we like about Tekken 6?
10161100	10164140	We tried to play it one night because Alan's like a Tekken fan.
10164140	10167820	I've always been a little more into the Capcom games, but as of late, I'm about ready to
10167820	10168540	jump ship.
10168540	10172540	But we were just kind of playing it going, this game's kind of, we're not, like, we're
10172540	10173660	just not into it.
10173660	10174860	Like, I don't know what it is.
10174860	10175980	Alan, do you, can you explain?
10176860	10180460	Yeah, we did story mode or whatever for, with a few characters.
10180460	10184220	And it's like, we didn't really recognize the roster.
10184220	10186540	And there were a lot of characters, but no one felt interesting.
10186540	10190300	And we played story mode a few times and beat the end boss.
10190300	10192140	And it's like, this isn't really compelling us.
10193580	10195260	It's kind of, I don't know, average.
10196140	10196620	It's that-
10196620	10198220	I can kind of see where you're coming from.
10198220	10202380	I mean, first and sole caliber, to be honest, because you play that in, like, a few hours
10202380	10202880	you've done.
10203420	10206140	But I mean, the arena mode is very lacking.
10206140	10209580	You just go into scenario, you play through with these guys.
10209580	10214460	And even though they're already in the fucking other modes, like, you can just play straight
10214460	10217260	away, it still gives you the option to go get them.
10217260	10219660	And then you can play through, oh, you can get the random movie.
10219660	10224380	But again, you can just play a load of matches until you actually get those.
10224380	10228460	Like, 10, every 10 matches you got, like, an ending or a scenario movie, whatever.
10228460	10230700	I think you make some good points.
10230700	10234620	But as a big Tekken fan, I mean, graphically, it was great.
10234620	10237660	And they kind of introduced some weird characters.
10237660	10239820	But I mean, I think they did okay with it.
10239820	10241900	And Tekken 7, yeah.
10241900	10244620	I mean, and I'm a fan of Capcom, don't get me wrong.
10244620	10246860	I like their games, I love their games.
10246860	10249580	But, you know, let's hope they get better.
10249580	10252460	And as for the DLC, that's great news as well.
10252460	10256700	I will say this, I am super curious, especially in light of the DLC news.
10256700	10258540	You know, we did get Street Fighter X Tekken.
10258540	10262140	But remember, they're supposed to be a Tekken X Street Fighter as a part of this.
10262140	10263900	Namco is going to get their chance, too.
10263900	10267340	So I'm really freaking curious.
10267340	10271580	Like, I kind of hope that's one of the things that's coming out at E3 this year.
10271580	10275740	Uh, you know, to get the first look at is the Tekken X Street Fighter.
10275740	10277580	What is the other half going to look like?
10277580	10278140	Because remember...
10278140	10279740	Yeah, I lost. Sorry, go ahead.
10279740	10283900	No, I was just going to say, there was always Capcom versus SNK was a huge, huge, huge game.
10283900	10286700	Well, there was also SNK versus Capcom that wasn't bad.
10286700	10290220	It just didn't quite get that same, you know, didn't catch on.
10290220	10291180	I wasn't a big fan.
10291180	10295420	I like the Capcom SNK games, but the other one, that's vckos, wasn't it?
10295420	10297820	Yeah. Oh yeah, as vckos. That's right. Yeah, yeah.
10297820	10299820	Yeah, that was, I didn't really like the look of it.
10299820	10303420	It looked very, you know, I was kind of like, you know, let's push the envelope.
10303420	10304940	Yeah, but it didn't look great.
10304940	10307900	I didn't really, you know, fall into that side of it.
10309100	10311020	Again, I had a point to make. I can't remember.
10311020	10312140	But anyway, yeah.
10312140	10317900	Well, let's hope that, I mean, I saw the box art for Tekken X Street Fighter, whatever it was.
10317900	10320060	Um, I think it's going to be a pretty cool game.
10320060	10323740	While in our chatroom, let's hope they don't fuck up like Capcom did.
10323740	10326780	Leave the shit on the disc, you know, hackers gonna hack and all that.
10326780	10327980	Yes, sir.
10327980	10331500	Wylund in our chatroom says Tekken X Street Fighter is 10% complete. Wow.
10332620	10333420	Got a ways to go.
10333420	10337660	By the way, I would like to point out that my personal favorite in the Tekken series was Tekken 3.
10337660	10338700	Me too. Absolutely.
10339740	10342060	Absolutely. Yeah, Yoshimitsu never looked cooler.
10342060	10345900	So he stuck through there to the next game, Street Fighter X Tekken.
10345900	10347820	I think he looks the same as far as I remember.
10347820	10350540	I used, I'm sorry, go ahead.
10350540	10356140	I used Jin and they changed his moves as of Tekken 4, which he had like my favorite
10356140	10359820	Jun moves and all the rest were Kazuya moves and I was in love.
10359820	10360780	But yeah.
10360780	10365420	I actually like both. I mean, I think it's cool that, you know, because Kazuya was in
10365420	10369100	quotation marks dead, you know, that they actually stuck Jin in and said, okay, well,
10369100	10374700	here's his illegitimate son or whatever. But the whole, I hate my dad thing then in Tekken 4.
10375340	10376700	Um, yeah, why not?
10376700	10379180	I think, I think the karate kind of looks cool when he does it.
10379180	10382220	But again, you know, you don't want too many characters with the same moves.
10382220	10384780	You got, hey, Hatsune Kazuya, you're pretty much the same.
10385340	10388940	Um, yeah, so it's fresh. It's new.
10388940	10390540	It worked. I think it worked for me anyway.
10390540	10392460	So, I mean, if you like it or not.
10393340	10396700	All right. Well, Porkchop, I got to let you go so we can wrap up the show.
10396700	10398460	But I appreciate you sharing your perspective.
10398460	10402380	There's nothing wrong with a friendly little talk about what games we do and don't like.
10402380	10403420	So Porkchop, take care, buddy.
10403420	10404700	And thanks again for staying up late.
10404700	10405500	Absolutely.
10405500	10407420	Keep the dream alive, guys. All the best.
10407420	10408300	Take care, buddy.
10408300	10411500	I was going to say that the reason why it's only 10% done is because they're working on,
10411500	10414140	you know, Tekken Tag 2 right now.
10414140	10415580	Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
10415580	10416780	That's coming up this year.
10416780	10419580	Yeah, it's going to come up on multiple consoles this year, isn't it?
10419580	10420060	Yeah.
10420060	10421260	So, all right.
10421260	10422620	Um, let me burn through.
10422620	10423740	We're going to close the Skypline.
10423740	10425340	I'm sorry to those that didn't get through.
10425340	10426380	Uh, very sorry.
10426380	10427660	Please consider sending us an email.
10427660	10429420	Mailbag at orangelawandtrader.com.
10429420	10431580	Again, the show is an ending.
10431580	10432860	It's a very important point.
10432860	10433740	The show is an ending.
10433740	10436940	So we'll have a show just like always next week, especially podcasties.
10436940	10440300	If you're listening on the podcast feed, you're going to be like, oh, next week?
10440860	10444700	Like, same show, but I'm just hearing some slightly different websites given and some
10444700	10449580	different, you know, things that will slowly unravel itself throughout the coming year.
10450140	10453100	Anyway, um, back to some tweets.
10453100	10458860	Tiger Claw also tweeted us, new Facebook lawsuit highlights trouble with kids and virtual currency.
10458860	10459580	Oh, God.
10460380	10464780	I can only imagine just that how the kids can just rack up all this money so easily.
10464780	10466940	It's kind of sick.
10466940	10471420	But yeah, another complaint was filed against Facebook with the US district court.
10471420	10474220	According to this link, the tire costs on us at Gama Sutra.
10474860	10478380	This isn't the only instance of companies getting in trouble over minors purchasing
10478380	10479500	credits for social games.
10480140	10486300	A US district judge upheld a handful of claims that Apple distributed free iOS apps that
10486300	10488300	trick children into money in app purchases.
10491660	10494700	Children are allowed to do Facebook accounts from the age of 13.
10494700	10498060	However, if you're under the age of 18, you're supposed to ask for your parents permission
10498060	10499740	before buying Facebook credits.
10502220	10504220	I'm surprised it's just not shut off altogether.
10504220	10507100	Maybe that's considering that you had to put your credit card information in.
10507100	10509740	I believe that if you're 13, you don't have a credit card.
10509740	10511260	How hard is it to open mom's wallet?
10511980	10514220	Well, then that's a problem with fraud.
10515660	10516940	And they should throw that kid in jail.
10518140	10519260	Throw the kids in jail.
10520300	10523020	S.J. 100 Matt says, hey, remember Para Para Paradise?
10523020	10524780	Yeah, fuck yeah, I love that game.
10524780	10527740	Well, a new Para style arcade machine is coming out soon.
10527740	10529980	And yes, it has Gaga.
10529980	10534300	Oh, because every, every freaking music game these days has to have Gaga.
10534300	10534940	Don't get me wrong.
10534940	10536220	I love Lady Gaga, but damn.
10536940	10538380	Dancecore is the game.
10538380	10539260	I guess it's coming out.
10539260	10542220	He links us to a little YouTube of somebody playing it.
10542220	10554860	It just looks like it's going to be on connect.
10555660	10557340	Maybe not in this country, but it'll be connect.
10558300	10561580	But they say, yeah, they say in the article, it's more closer to Para Para Paradise
10561580	10564220	than it is like DDR or Dance Central or anything like that.
10565020	10569420	Or maybe Dance Masters, because that kind of had a lot of power in it.
10569420	10575180	But anyway, um, that's really, I think that's going to do it for tweets tonight.
10575180	10577740	Thank you guys for sending us tweets, twitter.com slash O L R.
10577740	10579020	So we've got to wrap up the show.
10579020	10581100	We've got to, um, wrap it.
10581100	10581980	Oh, wait, I did.
10581980	10584700	I got one last tweet that came in.
10584700	10587500	Let me read this one from gamer girl.
10588220	10590540	I have a question regarding GLBT.
10591260	10593900	I know someone who is bi and they want to come out.
10593900	10596380	So to speak, what is the best way to do so?
10596380	10600460	Oh, he turned the knob, opened the door.
10600460	10601580	Here we go.
10601580	10607900	Um, I know there's a lot of, you know, obviously I'm speaking as the gay guy on the show.
10607900	10611980	I know there's a lot of society pressures that come with like coming out and all that stuff.
10611980	10616060	And sometimes it's one of those things people kind of feel like they kind of have to do
10616060	10617660	to get it off their chest.
10617660	10624060	I really truly believe a person should not feel like they're forced to do it until they're ready.
10624060	10627580	Because taking that first step to really like come out to yourself
10628140	10631500	can be one of the hardest things you have to do in that whole process.
10632140	10638060	So, you know, don't ever feel any pressure that you do, or you don't have to do anything.
10638700	10643580	You know, for your friend, whoever your friend wants to love is their choice.
10643580	10647420	Whoever your friend wants to have a relationship with is ultimately their choice.
10647420	10653020	You know, that's a private matter that is public when you want it to be public, your friend.
10653020	10656620	So, um, they want to come out or whatever.
10656620	10657980	What's the best way to do so?
10657980	10660860	You're gonna, you need to tell the people that are closest to you.
10660860	10664700	True friends are not going to turn the other way.
10665580	10668700	Some may kind of say, you know, I'm always kind of suspected,
10668700	10670380	but it doesn't really change anything.
10670380	10674460	I had the really good fortune that when I came out, everybody was supportive.
10674460	10677260	There was very few people that I got into shit with.
10677260	10680780	And anybody that was a problem, ain't in my life anymore.
10680780	10685100	Bye, you know, but there's been a lot of great people that
10685100	10687260	most people I know just don't really care.
10687820	10689740	And I think that's, that's fine.
10689740	10693740	I will say this that most of my friends that came out and told me, I was usually like, duh.
10696060	10702220	Um, the fact that it's bi and not gay can be a really tricky line to walk as well.
10703100	10706140	And you know, that could be a lot.
10706140	10711260	You know, this could be somebody who's still questioning in a lot of ways and says,
10711260	10714860	maybe I'm having these type of tendencies, you know, or whatever.
10714860	10717900	All I'm saying, don't ever, don't ever feel like whoever you are,
10717900	10722140	you have to pigeonhole yourself into one bucket or another or whatever.
10722700	10724780	Just love somebody.
10725900	10728460	And you know, my best, preferably yourself first.
10728460	10729580	Yeah. Oh yeah, absolutely.
10729580	10733820	Starting with yourself, accept yourself and everybody else will come easy.
10733820	10737100	That's the best advice I can give. Love yourself first.
10737660	10740540	Then those closest to you and your true friends will show their colors.
10740540	10743020	Now, now can I say the witty thing?
10743020	10743520	Yes.
10744220	10745900	For the ones that come easy.
10745900	10746860	Some people are easy.
10748860	10749360	Stop.
10749420	10749920	All right.
10749980	10751020	Um, that's it.
10751020	10751900	That's it for tweets.
10751900	10753980	That's it for Skype calls.
10753980	10755100	That's it for the show.
10756620	10760060	Thank you guys for staying up late with us on what has been a very interesting
10760060	10765580	episode of Orange Lounge Radio and a new chapter starts next week.
10765580	10768060	And can't wait to tell you all the details a little later.
10769420	10773180	We'll stay tuned to our Twitter feed, twitter.com slash olr, our Facebook,
10773180	10776220	facebook.com slash orange lounge radio, our website, of course, orange
10776220	10777260	lounge radio.com.
10777260	10781180	All the details in the coming days will be on the website.
10782460	10784220	That's all I have to say for now on that.
10784220	10790460	Anyhow, everything else about the whole situation will be in the podcast
10790460	10790700	feed.
10790700	10793820	We're going to replay the call that happened with Bobby, and I think
10793820	10796460	everything else we have to say on it is all contained in there.
10797420	10801580	In the meantime, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10801580	10803260	Loki, your final thoughts tonight.
10803260	10806460	This is really strange, but there was this kid, because I took Josh to the
10806460	10809580	park today, practicing his unicycle, which begged the question.
10809580	10815660	If a bicycle can be shortened to a bike, would a unicycle be a eunuch?
10822700	10824300	My final thought is.
10827500	10831740	I feel like I felt this weekend that I have a lot of drama in my life
10831740	10835260	right now, but I feel really good tonight.
10835260	10839100	And I want to thank all you for being a part of that dark soccer, because
10839100	10840860	people will shoot me if I don't say it.
10840860	10842060	Reject false icons.
10844060	10845740	Have a wonderful night, everybody.
10845740	10846940	We'll see you next week.
