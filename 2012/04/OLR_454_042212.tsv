249	3950	You're listening to the podcast Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 454.
4750	11632	Before we get to tonight's show, we would like to start with an important announcement that occurred during the taping of the Bobby Blackwolf show the night of the recording.
12192	14853	Up first is that clip, courtesy of the Bobby Blackwolf show.
20855	23375	But right now, it is 6 p.m.
23416	24076	on the West Coast, 9 p.m.
25595	30540	On the East Coast, and I want to say hello to all the OLR listeners that are coming in for OLR.
30600	31301	I'm Bobby Blackwolf.
31321	34304	I'm typically the opening act here on Sunday nights.
35345	40470	We typically don't talk meta that much about where we broadcast all that often.
41431	48799	We feel that those type of conversations are best kept off the airwaves and in private, but indulge us for a few moments as we discuss some things here.
50322	50923	AllGamesRadio.com
67628	76273	We've had a lot of great experiences here with this network from E3 Outpost to the Xbox Live Gamer Picks to PAX 08 and E4 All and the live broadcast.
76373	81716	Lots of great things have happened that I know I personally will cherish for the rest of my life.
82636	89240	And even though I was removed as station manager and site admin several years ago, I've enjoyed the community and the stage that has been here.
89320	92362	It's been my home for one hour a week here on Sunday nights.
94468	99512	There are changes coming to All Games Radio and they're changes I don't personally endorse.
100333	105497	They're not necessarily bad, but they're not ones I personally want to be a part of.
106558	117908	And one of the other show hosts here on the network stated that if all you wanted to do was just have a stage to do your own show and not attempt to help move forward to make the network a better place, then you needed to get out of the way.
119577	137454	so even though I don't personally endorse the proposed changes I don't wish to stand in the way of them so tonight right now I'm announcing that this right here is my final broadcast on All Games Radio well
137992	141734	This might be a good time to mention that there is a reason we haven't hung up just yet.
142595	153320	You know, Orange Launch Radio started as its own fully-fleshed radio station in 2002 on Live 365, and after five years, we made a business decision in light of escalating costs to move to the All Games Network.
154481	158643	This arrangement, as Bobby mentioned, it was really initiated and championed for by Bobby.
159324	166207	We've been absolutely honored to have Bobby as he puts it in his words as an opening act for the past five years.
166267	167148	We view it a little differently.
167828	172870	But without Bobby's efforts, it's very possible that OLR, as we know it, would have ended several years ago.
174370	176971	You know, change to All Games Radio is going to be a great thing for the station.
177831	186754	But it's time to let you all know that a plan was drafted some time ago that will require us in order to take Orange Lounge Radio to the next level to leave the network as well.
187935	194137	Tonight's upcoming episode, episode number 454, will be the last Orange Lounge Radio on the All Games Network.
196277	201758	We've been fierce supporters of independent podcasting and podcasters and this is not and will not change.
202599	209380	We remain supporters and fans of the All Games Network even though the future for Orange Lounge Radio will involve our show being elsewhere.
210300	217102	Out of respect to the other hosts and community at All Games Radio we will not be unveiling those plans here on their bandwidth.
217862	218322	Stay tuned.
218342	219062	You know where to find us.
219602	224243	Yes, the show will go on next week and yes, Bobby is still the co-headliner.
227287	227848	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
245307	246007	Thanks for watching!
264932	292758	the community here at All Games we've had some good days and we've had some bad days people that are probably in the community more often than just Sunday nights know what I'm talking about but ultimately I will remember a lot of the good stuff the hardest part of this is that I will probably be leaving the chat room where I've idled for almost a decade sometime this week and it's going to be kind of hard to say goodbye to that but sometimes it's time to move on Tigerclaw
294605	295965	You guys probably don't realize this.
296845	302546	If it was not for Tiger Claw, this stage that we have been on probably would have collapsed a year ago.
302666	309528	He is the man that has been keeping the light on for the rest of us because he's been kind of acting as station manager.
310128	315109	He has championed bringing in other people, other podcasts to the community.
316869	320370	I'm sure that he's going to help keep the light on for much, much longer.
320450	322650	Thank you very much to Tiger Claw for everything.
324232	325913	And also, lastly, Scott Rubin.
326574	344328	And while Scott and I did not see eye to eye on everything, and I might have actually felt that there were some unfair characterizations made of me back on the All Games Interactive days, off the air, he has been very supportive of me and wanted me to succeed in everything that I wanted to accomplish.
345169	352075	I am here to do this tonight because of him, because of his advice, because of his support.
352715	353736	Without Scott Rubin...
354284	358668	There would be no Bobby Blackwolf, literally, as in he actually picked out that name.
359169	360570	I didn't come up with that name, Scott did.
361571	367076	Just as Scott has moved on from all games, he's doing high-profile live streams for mainstream TV networks.
367816	374843	It is time for me to move on from all games, but I thank Scott for every single opportunity that he has given me.
376860	379982	We want to thank some people too, but our lists are probably very similar.
381083	384804	First, Bobby Blackwolf, obviously, for all the obvious things we've already stated.
386165	392869	The other hosts at All Games Radio that work their asses off to produce quality content for this network and promote the independent gaming community.
393429	397371	I personally have loved meeting all of you at the various events.
397771	401515	The Paxes, The E3s, The Outpost, so on.
402416	408501	Unfortunately, not every show is really in the All Games Network to promote the community, but I'm not going to dwell on that.
408581	410623	There's a lot that are very passionate about it.
411024	415128	You've been noticed, you've been appreciated, and I hope we can work with you in the future.
416289	422715	Although we don't want to name everyone specifically for fear of leaving someone out, if there's one host we need to tip our hat to besides Bobby...
423355	428199	It's our own personal podfather and the man that taught us a lot about internet radio, Travis Donovan.
429561	434265	Specifically to the OL Army, if you're hearing this, you've stuck by us through every tough decision we've made.
434665	438008	You've supported us when we said we are no longer exclusively a Bomani show.
438408	446231	You supported our creative decision to end the live afterbirth segment of our show because it just wasn't striking our creative spark anymore.
446731	453854	You supported us when we left Live 365 to take our show to the next level and we know you will support us as we leave All Games Radio to take it to Stage 3.
454694	458996	And I think this is a good time to reiterate, we will be back next week.
459736	469682	and you will be able to listen to us just as easy as you do now but out of respect towards the network we're keeping that under our hat as to exactly how that's going to happen for a few more days.
471363	473784	Tigerclaw gets our thanks as well.
474105	477006	All games would not be able to function right now without Tigerclaw.
477306	481469	He's passionate about this network and every host on this network owes you a lot of thanks.
483021	501389	of course Scott Rubin although certainly we've mentioned Bobby a bit in how we ended up at all games Scott was a crucial piece of this as well although we give the mainstream gaming press a lot of shit on this show Scott is someone who lived it left it and built an online network that fit in his independent vision and we all have so much respect for that
502469	505150	So, I know I've been monopolizing the conversation.
505190	507832	This is like the first time in probably five years I've read from a script.
508352	513614	But I want to allow DarkSakura and Loki, because their OLR is just as much as me, to say anything they want to say about this as well.
513894	516055	I'd like to thank myself for being awesome.
516255	518817	No, really, you said everything that I could say.
519237	520457	And Jesus has nothing to do with this.
521458	522538	Thank you for letting us know.
522899	523739	Loki, anything?
524890	529158	And I will still not be updating the radio app on PSP.
529178	532484	Well, our PSP.com will still stay out of date.
532544	534147	Some things shouldn't change.
534849	536071	Some things have to stay the same.
536913	537494	Bobby, it's all you.
538905	541526	Well, I think that this is the part where I'll be letting you guys go.
541566	543226	I had to write my stuff to a script too.
543326	546687	So any last words here before I send everybody off?
547827	548367	Don't cry.
548687	550588	That goes for you and it goes for the listeners.
551188	551708	It ain't over.
552168	552948	We still have a show left.
552968	553348	Stay tuned.
553368	554729	We're still having a show tonight.
556269	557129	I know this is shocking.
558670	564131	But this is how you have to start the future.
565331	566332	and good luck to everybody.
566632	568854	And I really, really wish all games the best of luck.
568994	571616	And thank you so much for having us for the past five years.
572317	572597	Good luck.
573178	573478	All right.
573718	575359	Orange Lounge Radio is up next.
575560	576280	Thanks so much, guys.
577761	578042	Thank you.
598424	610462	Tonight, April 22, 2012, Halo 4 has a release date, Nintendo announces new games for the 3DS, and the upcoming enhanced Baldur's Gate won't be coming out for one particular system.
616229	619152	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers, DarkSakura
639389	640969	It's always some fad diet with you.
641009	642050	It's not a fad.
642070	644170	Not fad diet, but it is always some diet.
645110	646410	I was really happy as a vegan.
646430	648211	I think you're purdy just the way you are.
648471	649651	I'm not doing this for purdy.
649691	650651	I'm doing it for healthy.
650851	651371	All right, fine.
651791	653932	Also say hello to Tech Master Loki.
654092	654272	Hi.
654532	656192	Who's still on his pizza diet, clearly.
656752	657473	It's not a diet.
659013	661273	Well, because that implies that I'm eating pizza all the time.
661353	662153	Well, Loki, don't worry.
662193	663614	I think you're purdy just the way you are.
664414	664934	Really not.
666618	669280	All right, so anyhow, we're here.
669400	669981	We're live.
670681	680750	Live, as you'll hear on the podcast, as our live listeners heard for the last time, at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwell Show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.
681110	686535	Join our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to chat live with us on this lovely evening.
687316	688116	What is the date today?
688136	688617	I don't even know.
688697	689437	April 22nd, 2012.
689477	691459	That's right, because my birthday was last week.
691519	691980	That's right.
692100	693162	Happy darn birthday.
693202	697089	Before we get into our gaming weeks, let's talk about we were gone last week.
697129	697890	We didn't have a show.
698051	701136	I know this was a whopper of a night to come back to, but hey, it's just how it went down.
702058	704242	DarkSakura, how was your birthday?
704262	704903	What'd you end up doing?
705242	707143	Well, not really a whole bunch of stuff.
707283	711544	I went to get delicious Indian food with you and Alan and Pinkberry.
712744	717286	And Dan took me to Claim Jumper where we split an ID clear for dinner.
718146	719626	I felt so sick that night.
720047	724348	He got me a really neat art book from 1944 that I've had my eye on.
724688	725449	It was neat.
726069	726670	It's very cool.
726690	729052	It was very old museum-y when I saw the pics.
729072	736258	Well, on top of that, it was a lot of... Because keep in mind, this particular edition was fresh right after World War II.
736939	741683	And it had some of the really cool art movements that had occurred just like 10 years before that.
741803	744866	So for me as a designer, it was a real treat.
745346	749010	And then you and Alan got me a sailor suit for my Duffy.
749850	751732	So you can look at your Duffy bear and say, Hey, Thaler.
752133	754956	Yeah, well, I love Duffy, you all know that.
756458	758380	You two are the only people who got me presents.
759821	760262	It's okay.
761303	764226	I have everything else that I pretty much want, so it's all good.
764306	768731	Plus, once you get to a certain age, it's kind of hard to buy presents anymore.
768971	769471	Outro Music
787737	788738	and video games cost $60.
789238	788738	$60.
789258	794762	Do you know that's how much I paid for Killer Instinct on the SNES?
794802	798345	Yeah, I was going to say, I guess to be fair, video games have always been kind of expensive.
798545	801147	I mean, Street Fighter 2 as a cartridge was, what, $80?
802107	805089	Wasn't it one of those, or Mortal Kombat 2 or one of those?
805109	807131	Do you know what the most I've ever paid for a video game is?
807891	808792	Actually, I probably do.
809072	811714	Was it your Castlevania Symphony of the Night on Saturn?
811774	813235	No, I've paid more.
813795	814056	Okay.
814216	815557	Well, actually, the Saturn one was like $20.
816237	817198	Your game with the dish.
817578	819159	It would probably be a Neo Geo game.
819439	820639	It is a Neo Geo game.
820819	823721	It was $280 for King of Fighters 2000.
824181	826242	But Dan and I thought it was going to be the last one to come out.
826582	829003	Little did we know the Summer Showdown 5 would be the last one to come out.
829423	832444	But hey, we wanted to buy a brand new Neo Geo game just to say we had.
832464	833465	And we were in a different place then.
834465	848259	but um but no um I pretty much you know if there were the like the only thing that I actually had on my want list you know if you could call it that is an iPad and I'm waiting on that one because I'm going to Disneyland next month hello
849760	852601	So, you know, I can wait on that.
852641	853642	I have my netbook.
853722	854122	It works.
854722	863346	You know, it's sort of like, like I'd said, you know, back during Hanukkah, Christmas-ka, Kwanza-ka, whatever holiday was going on.
863366	864727	Insert politically correct statement here.
864927	865227	I know.
865707	868349	Christmas, I can't remember how.
868389	868809	Festivus.
869489	898651	so it's like I've got tons of stuff I don't really need anything and I've got tons of stuff to do you know it's like it's not like I can't just go and play Mass Effect that Rob loaned me I have no problem just going and playing Mass Effect that I bought myself but anyway but you know I've got I have great friends and I have a wonderful hubby who sometimes can be a jerk face but for the most part is really cool
899267	900308	You're going to make me sick.
900468	902571	There's too much emotion on this fucking network tonight.
903472	907716	But for the most part, like I said, I've got everything I pretty much need.
908016	908737	So I'm cool.
910159	912241	I'm not all gimme gimme anymore.
913222	914924	Although I do like the ABBA song.
917552	935183	I was off last week because I went to Disneyland for Jamie's birthday I went to the final electronica that was the whole reason because I am such a nerd I had to go to the final electronica I've talked about it a million times on the show I don't want to re-explain it but you know it was really great to be there for the last show and everybody booing when they pulled the plug
935843	939485	A little disappointed that they just literally shut the lights off on everybody.
939545	940425	You know, grid's down.
940705	942286	LOL, bye, get out.
942746	948188	I got to see the Tron pinball machine, but Flynn's Arcade was so crowded because people knew it was the last night it would be operating.
948488	949549	You know, Dan's friend has one.
949949	950349	Oh, really?
950749	975317	has the deluxe edition too I need his address yeah I'm gonna go play uh supposedly they're keeping the Tron pinball machine at Disneyland it'll be like the one Tron thing still left in the parks um but it was it was kind of a crowded day um so we didn't get to do a whole whole lot but electronica but that's what we went for and I was happy um I did the driving so I didn't get to play a lot of games in the car sadly Loki you you guys have actually been out because you I
975777	978038	You guys weren't on the last show before the vacation, right?
978058	979899	Because that was the Jason and Alan show, right?
980039	981540	Yeah, because it was Easter.
981640	982400	Yeah, how was your Easter?
982420	983781	What have you been up to, Loki, personally?
984141	993425	Not much, just hanging around the house and took Josh over to my mom's house and did the egg hunt and stuff.
993445	994946	He didn't really care about that stuff, though.
995126	995767	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1018462	1022123	DarkSakura, what video games have been in your world this week?
1041204	1045989	Well, not so much actually playing, but we've been doing playthrough watching lately, Dan and I have.
1046009	1046649	That's fair.
1047030	1054016	So we watched a playthrough of Samurai Shodown because my friend Gary had never, he didn't even know about the game.
1054517	1056198	And we're like, what planet are you on?
1056599	1058080	And how are we letting you in our house?
1058100	1059101	We're fixing this right now.
1059501	1060042	Exactly.
1060142	1066327	And we were even explaining some of the bad translation in it, some of the English, which was funny.
1066868	1071071	Like how we were calling Amoksa a happy funster.
1072393	1080800	And just showing, even talking about, because a lot of the characters in the game are based on historical and cultural fictional characters.
1080840	1082381	So we were trying to explain.
1082561	1083642	It was pretty cool.
1084543	1087724	and then today we're actually watching a playthrough of Klonoa.
1088684	1090705	So that's why I said my next cat's name is going to be Klonoa.
1090745	1091565	Oh yeah, I saw that on Facebook.
1091585	1093365	And I'm going to get a rat named Hupow.
1094385	1095566	Just because it's fun to say Hupow.
1096706	1108309	And I actually, you know, I've got a new job so I've, and since I'm also in school full time and still have all of the graphic design projects that I took on while I wasn't working.
1109209	1114872	I have been a busy bee, so I haven't really had that much time to sit and really play through anything.
1115292	1119234	I haven't even had time to play much WoW, which... Oh my gosh!
1120575	1125517	I've done like two dungeons all week, and then one of them was so fail that I quit halfway through.
1125993	1126413	I hate that.
1126433	1130076	And then it just derails your spirit for the game for a whole week.
1130236	1130476	I know.
1130496	1132217	I'm just like, ugh, screw these people.
1132257	1133818	Why are Horde players so stupid?
1133998	1137681	One of my friends was telling me today about how Final Fantasy XIII too did that to him.
1138061	1144345	He was running around for literally three hours trying to figure out what to do and realized he was in the wrong time thing.
1144445	1148688	They went to the wrong part of the story and he was supposed to be in a chocobo that jumps.
1150609	1155293	Now you know how I feel when my Kingdom Hearts 2 game glitched when I skipped a planet.
1156133	1156833	and couldn't go back.
1157434	1161155	I actually skipped all of Agrabah.
1161175	1166577	Going to our chat room at chat.orangelongeradio.com, Breakman is in there saying, Sky doesn't have children or pets for their safety.
1167097	1170379	Actually, I am the wicked stepfather to two kitties.
1171359	1176341	My other half, Alan, when we moved in together, he brought old kitties.
1176421	1177781	They're 12 years old this month, I believe.
1178081	1178962	They're getting old.
1180542	1182163	They're Medicare kitties, but they're still cute as hell.
1185111	1187632	Yeah, and sometimes Sanrio will let me pet her.
1187852	1190152	Yeah, Maruko is really an attention whore.
1190172	1190672	He is cool.
1190692	1204396	Like, all I have to do, like, I go into bed, lie down, get my DS open, like, I'm going to play DS or B on my iPhone, and, like, within minutes, and he jumps up on the bed, and he doesn't just, like, get on my feet like some cats do or get on my chest or whatever.
1204716	1205956	He gets up in my face.
1206056	1207277	Like, I am here, bitch.
1207337	1208497	Pet me right now.
1208917	1211018	I told you what Shermie used to do when we had our bed on the floor.
1211978	1217540	She used to crawl in under the sheets in the middle of it because Dan and I use, we have separate blankets because we're both sheet hogs.
1218060	1219441	So we just use our own blankets.
1219961	1227143	And Shermie would crawl under and then put her head on my shoulder and just start purring away and sleep on my shoulder in the morning.
1227824	1228364	That's cute.
1228544	1230344	And usually just get up, bitch, and feed me.
1232165	1233085	Anything else for your gaming week?
1233646	1233726	Um...
1235273	1235473	No.
1235773	1236053	Alright.
1236353	1236893	My gaming week.
1237934	1241335	Actually, not a whole lot because I've been focused on one game.
1241815	1243215	What did you want to say, Jamie?
1243235	1244116	You thought of something, didn't you?
1244676	1248997	Damn stupid panda shit not installing.
1249317	1250097	Fuck you, Blizzard.
1250197	1250677	Fuck you.
1250957	1252698	Oh yeah, you got in the WoW beta and it won't work.
1253266	1255728	Yeah, and I left my hard drive at home and I was going to copy your files.
1255968	1259612	I would say something about, well, this is why they call it a beta, but I don't want to get hit.
1259632	1261053	Actually, I have a 4 gig flash drive on me.
1261073	1262154	You can use that guy.
1262174	1263235	You can borrow that guy over there.
1263395	1265757	I have a 1 terabyte hard drive just sitting there.
1265797	1266598	I've got a flash drive on me.
1266798	1267038	All right.
1267939	1268219	Anyhow.
1268660	1279089	But my thought is because I've moved my WoW folder in full before, I figured what I might be able to do is copy your installs and have them update on my computer.
1279734	1282656	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1302476	1303978	I just kept fast forwarding through the whole thing.
1303998	1305259	Did the guy say nanu nanu?
1305279	1305740	Yes, he did.
1306200	1311786	The very last thing, you know, after he does his splooge business is you hear nanu nanu and then it fades to the credits.
1312908	1315150	I was like, my childhood has just been raped.
1316371	1318193	This porn wasn't from the 70s.
1318253	1318333	No.
1318433	1319855	It was from like last year.
1319935	1321076	It was done this year.
1321136	1321637	Oh my God.
1322017	1341020	and it's called Mork and Mindy the Dream Zone Parody and it's like hideous and awful but the girl does look a lot like Pam Dauber and the guy that played Mork actually does a very good cracked out Robin Williams impression I realize there's change in all we've been talking about tonight but last I checked we weren't going to become a porn show
1341720	1343961	I just had to get that out because it was funny.
1344361	1345681	Alright, let me talk about my game of the week.
1345721	1346641	It's really been one game.
1346761	1347802	It's still Mass Effect 2.
1348142	1350142	But I did go through all the DLC this week.
1350262	1361345	I said, because I realize I am right at the very end and if I do the next mission, I set off a sequel of events where I won't get the best ending unless I play it to completion.
1361425	1363126	People who have played the game will know what I'm talking about.
1363466	1370068	And Alan's like a step ahead of me and he said, whoa, whoa, whoa, don't do that mission until you are absolutely ready to finish the game.
1370868	1371429	So I said, all right.
1371449	1372590	So I did every side quest.
1373170	1374111	I did Overlord.
1374271	1374972	I did Arrival.
1375092	1376113	I did Shadowbroker.
1376153	1376953	I played all of it.
1376993	1377874	Did Arrival enjoy it?
1378535	1383399	I'm kind of mad at myself for giving EA that much money, but damn, it was good.
1383459	1386742	Especially of note, I think my favorite out of all the DLC was Arrival.
1387502	1414828	and the reason why I think I preferred that one I mean Shadow Broker had a lot of cool stuff to it and there was a lot of great scenes I realize that's kind of commonly people's favorites the reason why I really loved Arrival was Arrival really felt like an episode of a freaking science fiction show like Battlestar Galactica or something like I am playing an episode of a show watching it play out it has its very cliche twists part way through a good beginning middle end I mean it plays out like an episode of a TV show and
1415328	1424211	I kind of wish, as much as I'm kind of eh on DLC, like this is something I really like seeing in games, is this like really true episodic content.
1424391	1429452	So, you know, I can support DLC when it's pretty awesome like that.
1429512	1431153	That was my favorite by far was Arrival.
1431953	1449871	and Shadow Broker kind of felt the same way too I realize it kind of plays in a lot more to the greater story and I think Arrival in some regards is supposed to tie it's kind of to bridge two and three together which I get but it still felt a lot like a standalone to me I will have beaten that game by this time tomorrow I'm pretty close and then
1450592	1456914	Thanks to the sale on Mass Effect 3 this week, I have my copy of Mass Effect 3 sitting in the screen craft ready to go.
1457714	1461416	So I can be really disappointed at the ending just like everybody else.
1461556	1471699	But the experience and the, what, probably 25 hours of Mass Effect 1 and 35 so far of Mass Effect 2 plus whatever I spend there will at least be worth it.
1472339	1473340	Loki, how about your gaming week?
1475863	1479306	Well, I started playing some more stuff on my PS3.
1480988	1486814	Basically, Infamous, I finally played a little bit of that, and it's okay.
1487395	1488035	It looks old.
1489036	1490278	Not even that old, but it's just...
1492365	1493906	It's alright, I may finish it.
1494546	1497929	Unfortunately, all my time is being taken up by Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3.
1498109	1500131	Yes, finally jumped on that bandwagon.
1501312	1513261	After playing Modern Warfare 1 for a long time, well, it seems like a long time, but a few months, we decided to go ahead and make the shift to Modern Warfare 3, and it's pretty awesome.
1513662	1515083	I enjoy it, playing...
1516023	1521087	Pretty much just all multiplayer, because the campaign, I can never really sit down and play that for long enough.
1521668	1522969	But I'm enjoying it.
1523069	1531415	I like the fact that, first off, the game still supports System Link, which is great, because our internet kind of sucks at my work.
1531855	1535158	Ironically enough, it fixed itself when we had a power outage.
1535218	1537460	All it took was shutting something off and turning it back on.
1537880	1543584	You know, the old IT standby, and yet someone... Calling Comcast tech support.
1543644	1544225	Dude, dude, dude.
1544645	1546847	Well, did you try power cycling?
1546927	1548407	I love how it's called power cycling.
1548668	1549788	Did you power cycle?
1549828	1551549	Like it's fucking something out of Tron.
1551870	1553651	Did you power cycle the cable modem?
1553871	1555752	Oh, just hit that big switch that says power.
1555772	1557893	Okay, now count to ten slowly with me.
1558534	1558594	One.
1559275	1560477	One, two, three.
1560557	1561378	Okay, now turn it back.
1562359	1569348	So instead of us having no connection to Xbox Live, we still have a shitty connection to Xbox Live.
1569428	1571511	I guess a shitty connection is better than no connection.
1571531	1572852	But we're playing System Link, so it doesn't matter.
1573753	1576977	But I like the fact that not only do they have System Link, but they have...
1577758	1578479	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1602300	1625985	um so I like the fact that they added that because they really didn't have to do that um which is nice I wish Grand Theft Auto 5 did that because I I just wish that that has system link because that'll be you know worth it but actually I picked up the game on um on PS3 and on 360 so I have it on both platforms I actually play with some of my co-workers on PS3 I'm actually for well I play online um on PS3 I haven't played online with my 360 yet but um
1628069	1628710	I may, you know.
1630031	1634134	I guess that means I have to create an elite clan, so we'll do the OLR army.
1634855	1636296	All right, get the OLR army.
1636856	1637097	Yeah.
1637517	1637837	Awesome.
1638418	1643302	All right, well, I guess that wraps it up for our gaming weeks, so we will get into some news here shortly.
1643682	1645103	First off, we usually do housekeeping.
1645944	1651048	I think we said the pretty big part that we were waiting to say, so we'll...
1651949	1652449	Ask Orange Lounge
1670562	1675785	Also, I do want to say, of course, as always, since we are on Facebook, we are on Google+, add us.
1675845	1677526	Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge.
1678667	1681888	And also, Google+, just look for Orange Lounge Radio.
1681928	1683329	Twitter.com slash OLR.
1684009	1685690	All right, let's get into some gaming news.
1685950	1687491	Loki, why don't you start us off with the news this week?
1687931	1690493	Nintendo, Nintendo, Nintendo
1707705	1708306	Super Mario Bros.
1708366	1709607	with Miis Super Mario Bros.
1709687	1710068	with Miis
1728024	1730606	I mean, I don't know, is that really a step up?
1730646	1732668	Do I really need a Wii U for that?
1732708	1737813	I mean, because you're just giving me the game that you had last year, or was it last year?
1737833	1738453	I don't know.
1738933	1744218	Recently, on the Wii, but now you're adding, you know, Mii support.
1744318	1744979	I mean, something that...
1745659	1756443	On a modern console, ones that have updates to their games, you could just patch in instead of releasing a whole new game for it.
1756703	1759324	I thought for some reason you could already do the Miis in the Wii game that was out.
1759424	1760344	I don't know why I thought that.
1761165	1766887	But I mean, okay, at least it'll be HD and native widescreen support or whatever.
1767767	1768807	There's got to be another catch.
1768948	1770368	There's got to be something they're not saying.
1771228	1772509	I cannot believe...
1773129	1775752	Especially if this ends up being a launch title, which we don't really know.
1776073	1778195	I'm assuming it's a launch window title.
1778235	1779036	It's a lot of 3DS stuff.
1779176	1783922	I think it could be a launch title, especially if it's based off New Super Mario Bros.
1784082	1784423	Wii.
1784463	1784843	That's true.
1784863	1786325	They've got to be rushing something.
1786365	1791131	I think they're going to learn from the mistake of the 3DS, and they're going to have a AAA something out.
1792231	1792812	You're probably right.
1792872	1793572	It's probably Mario.
1793932	1797053	But I'm curious what the little gimmick is going to be.
1798054	1805737	How could Nintendo put out a launch title for the Wii U and not somehow integrate the whole screen in your lap concept?
1807037	1814280	It'll be something derpy like when you go in a pipe, you're on your screen and your other partners are still out there in the world.
1815481	1815801	Watch.
1815941	1818882	It'll be something silly like that.
1820914	1826781	I have an idea what this is already, but we're not covering that until later.
1827682	1832026	I think it's a port of a game that's coming to another platform that they're going to do some things.
1832547	1837072	That other game may integrate with the Wii U since it has two screens.
1838836	1839897	I can see where you're going with this.
1839998	1841960	Anybody who's been paying attention to the news this week knows.
1842040	1843121	Otherwise, we'll get to it in a minute.
1843902	1845744	So, I don't know.
1846604	1853051	Besides Wii U, Mario, they're promising that they're going to reveal Pikmin.
1854793	1855474	And I'm assuming...
1856004	1856885	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1875515	1878476	I don't really know what... I don't know.
1878496	1879956	I guess we'll find out what it's about.
1880416	1882676	But I'm not excited about Pikmin.
1883596	1884397	I couldn't really care about it.
1884417	1889678	It's one of those series I just kind of missed because I was never really... You know, I didn't get into the... Wasn't the first one on the 64?
1889758	1891178	I don't remember.
1891378	1892358	Or was it a GameCube?
1893358	1894638	I think they were both GameCube ones.
1894738	1895899	I just missed the boat on Pikmin.
1896219	1899839	I understand people really love it, but it's one of the series I never got to play.
1899859	1900880	I was too busy with F-Zero.
1901300	1902020	Let's put it that way.
1903080	1903320	Yeah.
1903854	1906856	That'd be cool if they announced an F-Zero game for the Wii U. Don't tease me.
1922488	1923248	These things are going to happen.
1924589	1930431	Microsoft did announce that Halo 4 is going to launch worldwide Tuesday, November 6th.
1931552	1935253	Funny that they did the whole integration with Conan O'Brien.
1935673	1938214	There was a long segment on the Conan show on TBS.
1938694	1945517	Nine minutes about Halo and some funny voice like they were the background guys doing moving or something.
1945537	1946217	That was a little silly.
1946257	1947458	I hope it's in the game.
1947478	1950339	It was very red versus blue to me.
1951059	1954201	But it was cool because it was Conan and Andy Richter who are both awesome.
1955562	1963427	So, of course, there's the whole little corporate speak of with Halo 4 leading the charge, we're confident 2012 will be the most successful year in Xbox history.
1965068	1972013	We are beginning a new saga with Halo 4 and embarking on a journey that will encompass the next decade of Halo games and experiences.
1972633	1974734	Confirmed, Halo 4, 5, and 6.
1975475	1975915	Right there.
1976576	1977056	Confirmed.
1977518	1979719	and 7 and 8 and 9.
1980220	1985663	Of course, to be fair, they already said in a while this Halo 4 would be the first game in a new trilogy.
1985943	1989265	So it really, as much as I'm being sarcastic, it really isn't new news.
1989285	1992126	Honestly, I don't see a problem with a new Halo game coming out without Bungie.
1992166	1995989	Yeah, I understand that Bungie was kind of the driving force behind the last...
1997309	1997509	and so on.
2022217	2035708	um it hasn't hurt sales at all so I don't think that the fact that Halo 4 is going to come from a different studio that there's going to be any less quality in the game I think if anything it could be just like kind of fresh eyes on it I guess
2037904	2041127	It looks cool, just like the brief little snippets of things that they have on there
2059362	2065987	Um, uh, some of our chatters, Actdeft at chat.orange.radio.com says, I'm an Xbox person and I'm not excited about Halo at all.
2066487	2069289	Gamer Girl says, Halo is overplayed, just saying.
2069749	2076254	Porkchop says, Halo needs a kick to the crotch, one way to kill Master Chef, and Chef is not a typo.
2077274	2078535	I was like, surely he meant to say Chief.
2079036	2080797	Uh, Technus says, I like Halo.
2081037	2083098	It's not the shit everybody wants to believe it is.
2083179	2083539	Oh, it's not...
2084801	2085702	It's not the shit.
2085722	2087043	I think that means like, yeah, you're the shit.
2087103	2090146	It's not the shit as everybody wants to believe it is, but I won't knock it.
2090387	2092048	I think that's kind of how I feel about Halo.
2092509	2097053	Like, I'm not gonna like, oh my god, melt fanboy Halo, but it's a decent series.
2097093	2100277	There's a reason why it propelled the Xbox the way it did.
2100317	2103019	It was a great first-person shooter, especially on the original Xbox.
2103360	2103920	And it still is.
2103960	2104561	I mean, in what...
2105822	2108723	I mean, I don't think that they're doing another Gears of War game.
2108963	2110103	Well, I'm sure they'll find a way.
2110123	2111184	Nah, they'll find a way.
2111244	2116065	But supposedly, Gears of War is really, really dead and ain't coming back.
2117145	2120486	Now, here's one other thing I want to say about this before we go on to the next story.
2120886	2123427	November 6th is the day that the game is coming out.
2123927	2125468	The first Tuesday in November.
2126248	2130869	Is there anything else really big every four years especially?
2130889	2131109	Nope.
2133140	2136684	that people might kind of be caring about this year.
2136704	2138886	A lot of passion around it.
2139166	2140468	It has nothing to do with video games.
2140508	2142229	I don't think Call of Duty comes out that day.
2142309	2143150	No, no.
2143230	2145553	It's called Election Day here in the U.S.
2145593	2146133	That's right.
2146514	2147255	It's Election Day.
2147295	2148756	You know, we have this guy, the president.
2149697	2151279	You ever heard the name Barack Obama?
2152620	2153221	Barack Obama.
2153281	2155323	I don't listen to that hip-hop music, okay?
2158280	2161221	Well, it's the leader of our country.
2163622	2166223	That's a pretty amazing title for a hip-hop artist.
2166283	2173206	He has to run for office again because there's somebody else named Mitt Romney that thinks he shouldn't be president anymore.
2173226	2174627	That's a terrible hip-hop name.
2176491	2179094	Look, it's not a politics show and it's not a porn show.
2179694	2192466	Just an interesting observation, but I guess Microsoft got called on it and it was very like, you know, the statement they kind of released was like, well, we think a lot of people will be excited about both, you know, whatever.
2193207	2193507	Right.
2194187	2197971	Yes, let us hold our release of our game so you can have your little election.
2198251	2200794	Or we can just move on like, you know, the rest of the world is...
2201414	2202155	Let's be real.
2202895	2207099	In this day and age, you can vote absentee and Amazon delivers to your door.
2207359	2207840	There you go.
2207900	2211323	You don't have to leave the house to participate in democracy or fragging online.
2212424	2213244	I've been absentee.
2213525	2214986	Voting takes like a few minutes.
2215546	2216547	I like to vote in person.
2216707	2217728	I personally don't vote absentee.
2217768	2220390	How about putting those voting booths inside GameStop?
2221872	2222112	No.
2224474	2225575	Or another retailer.
2226916	2229098	That would actually be a really good idea.
2231368	2232328	Get more young voters.
2232768	2234029	Go to Claire's, then go vote?
2234969	2235329	Why not?
2236349	2237189	They should have them at the mall.
2237729	2239930	Jamba Juice, free smoothie with your vote.
2240010	2241690	I could get a Cinnabon while I vote.
2242510	2245811	See, that's a lot better than going to the Lutheran church around the corner from my house.
2245831	2246331	That is true.
2247111	2253312	I do feel like I have to go to the grade school to vote here, and I don't have kids, so I feel really awkward going to the grade school.
2253332	2255252	They're going to make you sit down at the really small desk.
2255272	2258253	Yeah, you have to go in the library, and I'm like, I'm a big person.
2258573	2260834	I'm hitting my head on the ceiling.
2261394	2262114	What's going on here?
2262154	2263254	It feels awkward.
2264175	2268036	Guys like me aren't supposed to be hanging around elementary schools unless I have kids, and I don't.
2268156	2269856	So what's my excuse?
2269876	2272437	And again, I have to go to the Lutheran church to drop mine off.
2273017	2274878	So I think I'm going to burst into flames or something.
2275938	2277219	You get to vote, then you get some Kool-Aid.
2277919	2278179	All right.
2278659	2279739	Moving on, moving on.
2279779	2281800	Dark Sakura, take us to a new story.
2282193	2289695	Well, for those of us who are blessed with iPhones, we have a great game coming up for iOS, although I have no idea how the fuck we're going to play it.
2290075	2292116	I'm sorry, can I read some great chat comments real quick?
2292136	2292616	Lord, what?
2293336	2295257	Infanel, I love this comment in chat room.
2295617	2298338	If corporations are people, can I vote Valve for president?
2299038	2299278	Okay.
2299698	2302779	GameGuru says, can I vote for Master Chief as my president?
2302859	2304299	Good way to tie the stories together.
2304339	2304839	Appreciate that.
2304919	2306780	Well, you know who I usually write in.
2307040	2307640	Bill the Cat.
2307660	2308040	Yes, Bill the Cat.
2308060	2309461	I've been doing this show with you for 10 years.
2309541	2310741	I know Bill the Cat very well.
2311328	2314991	Why don't they just call Obama Master Chief?
2315692	2317494	I would call him my Master Chief.
2317574	2320537	He is Master Chief.
2321177	2322018	Here's how you win this.
2322278	2323920	You put Obama in your fucking campaign.
2324500	2329986	Obama comes in, dressed up like Master Chief, kicks down a door, pulls off his helmet and says, go vote.
2330686	2331967	And that'll get people in there.
2332028	2334190	That's kind of how the Bin Laden speech went down.
2334310	2335090	But anyway, let's...
2335972	2337655	I don't remember him being in Master Chiefs.
2337856	2339900	Oh wait, that was when they made fun of him on late night.
2339940	2342145	Alright, no politics, moving on.
2342614	2345995	So anyway, this awesome game I'm referring to is Marvel vs. Capcom 2.
2346975	2349636	And it's going to be on iOS on April 25th.
2350116	2352557	I've only got the British price, which is £2.99.
2353417	2357018	But I'm assuming it's going to be a $5 game over in the US.
2358079	2363620	It said there's nothing yet announced as an upgraded version for iPad.
2363861	2366421	And it doesn't show the virtual D-pad on the screen.
2367282	2370303	So who knows exactly how it's going to control.
2370423	2371323	But hey...
2371923	2374125	The virtual d-pad is paid to unlock content.
2375686	2380168	On top of that, it has all 56 fighters from the original.
2380309	2382130	That was nice of Capcom to do for a change.
2385452	2386973	You fucking know they thought about it.
2387033	2388574	You know there was that guy in the boardroom.
2389354	2391956	We could have, you know, eight characters that come with it.
2392136	2394618	And then for 99 cents, do eight more and eight more.
2396019	2396499	You know what?
2397700	2397880	Meh.
2398223	2415944	But for real, Marvel vs. Capcom 2 on the iPhone If I had an iCade for the iPad If I had, which I don't think is on tonight's show roll, so I'll say it That Midway game on the iOS devices, that Midway Arcade Treasures Got support for the iCade this week
2416485	2417645	Yes, very yes.
2417785	2418786	Good idea.
2418906	2420606	That helped that game immensely.
2421027	2428009	So, IK'd support for Marvel vs. Capcom 2 would make it, you know, for those that don't own anything else, I guess, would make it desirable.
2428029	2429490	You know what I want IK'd to make?
2429830	2430050	Hmm?
2430570	2435372	I want them to make those little miniature arcade cabinets like they had in the 80s.
2436252	2437913	Yeah, so yeah, with the LEDs and everything?
2437933	2438113	Yeah.
2438153	2438413	Oh, yeah.
2438593	2440413	I want them to make, like, little cabinets like that.
2440614	2441214	I should make one.
2441234	2443475	I had a friend of mine that had a Donkey Kong little LED game like that.
2443495	2444315	I had a friend that had the Pac-Man.
2444335	2444635	It was awesome.
2445987	2456377	You know, I actually have a Frogger cabinet like that, like one of the really small LED ones, that I actually was going to convert into a MAME cabinet.
2456457	2457938	I remember when you bought that.
2458018	2459920	That was your whole $100 project, wasn't it?
2460260	2461061	No, I didn't buy that.
2461141	2462523	I actually got that free from a co-worker.
2463423	2465365	No, but I have the internals for it.
2465385	2470190	I have a Pico ITX board and a tiny little LCD screen.
2470819	2472062	That would be awesome-tastic.
2472182	2478959	The only problem is there's no room to put the controls on there because you realize you're all yeah, I can't really fit buttons on this thing.
2479813	2490083	See, that's what I was thinking Dan should do with his Transformer tablet, because it's an Android, and you can get MAME for Android, is to set that up.
2490463	2491925	But, you know, that's another story.
2492125	2494767	Just don't buy an iPad, I mean, for arcade games.
2495348	2497630	Buy an arcade cabinet for arcade games.
2497830	2500573	I mean, seriously, you're going to be spending about the same amount of money.
2500593	2501734	You might as well have the authentic...
2501914	2502354	That's true.
2502655	2503935	That BurgerTime I was looking at was $500.
2504676	2505777	That's how much an iPad would cost.
2506177	2508458	Well, I wanted an iPad for stuff other than games.
2509499	2510600	This isn't coming out on iPad.
2510940	2513101	Not like I don't already have three other copies of it anyway.
2513922	2514302	But still.
2514842	2516343	Gonna take you for a ride.
2517704	2518885	Alright, let's move on with some more news.
2520253	2520693	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2538568	2560672	um so it is coming out in Japan no word on US but probably coming out around the same time I know you're very cynical about Animal Crossing and you could give two shits about the improved park bench sitting or whatever features they're actually adding into this one however I have a friend a real person that I know that said holy shit Animal Crossing is coming out time to get a 3DS shit you not Animal Crossing has its fans
2561472	2568719	I understand, it's just like Apple product fans where they're like, holy shit, Apple has a new thing coming out, I gotta go get it.
2569059	2571161	I mean, it's just like this.
2571481	2583192	I was just glad that she spoke to me in that language for a change and didn't say... Well, I hope that when she plays it, she discovers a whole... It really makes a lot more sense in the Japanese version.
2583332	2587496	A wholly unique experience and not the same damn game again.
2588462	2591090	Do you know I found my Japanese Animal Crossing?
2592414	2593497	Okay, so she brought up porn.
2594989	2596049	A long time ago.
2596069	2596429	A long time ago.
2620796	2623758	It's what the little animals say.
2624078	2628580	It's really fun to put in dirty words and hear how the little animals interpret them.
2630061	2632442	Anyhow, sorry for dumbing down the show.
2634375	2634615	Okay.
2635937	2640423	They also announced that they're going to be doing a Kirby 20th Anniversary Edition on the Wii.
2641144	2648594	So, if you're even mildly interested in it, I would recommend picking it up, because if anything, remember those Mario... What?
2649114	2650116	You're recommending this?
2650316	2650877	You can't be... Look...
2651317	2655439	Hey, hey, I'm recommending this because of the resale value of the last Mario game.
2655799	2658841	And the last Mario game was a stupid ROM conversion.
2658921	2661422	It literally was a ROM from the SNES.
2661582	2666965	They're like, hey, we're going to just snap, you know, put this virtual console ROM on that disc.
2667245	2667685	Done!
2668005	2669746	No disrespect to the Kirby fans.
2669806	2670807	It's a great franchise.
2670907	2673648	However, you know, they did this with Mario.
2673688	2675109	They did it with Zelda back on the GameCube.
2675149	2676770	It was a pre-order bonus only thing.
2676850	2679311	So it was basically a virtual console on a disc.
2679871	2684793	Now, if they get some ones that we haven't seen elsewhere out on there, it'll be kind of awesome.
2685353	2689275	Yeah, it'd be neat if they were, I don't know, redone, but I think it's just a bunch of virtual console games.
2689415	2691976	At least this time, it's not going to be just one ROM.
2691996	2693957	So that'd be kind of neat.
2694477	2696358	No word on when that's coming out, but sometime this year.
2698039	2698179	And...
2699215	2703096	Super Mario Bros.
2703596	2706517	2 is now coming this August.
2707018	2708358	Both Japan and the US.
2709338	2711859	And looks exactly like New Super Mario Bros.
2712279	2711859	1.
2713380	2714820	But with now Raccoon Mario.
2717341	2717621	Hooray.
2717921	2718721	Raccoon's awesome.
2718981	2720162	Raccoon or Tanooki?
2720902	2721202	Raccoon.
2721242	2721582	Raccoon.
2721802	2722203	Cool.
2722563	2723163	Maybe Tanooki.
2723183	2723363	Who knows?
2723383	2724923	I thought the Tanooki suit was the most awesome.
2724983	2726344	Actually, my favorite was the Hammer Bros.
2726364	2726524	suit.
2727239	2734002	I'm just glad, though, that they have stuck with the same backgrounds from the first game so that, you know, Josh's room is still current.
2736302	2740244	Because, actually, that looks like Josh's room, except different patterns in the mountains.
2740592	2758354	is it sad that it seriously took me a minute because my first reaction when they announced the sequel was I was like holy shit already we just had Mario 3D Land last year and then I was like oh wait it's not a sequel to the 3D game this is a sequel on the 3DS to the Wii game
2759455	2761157	My brain actually had to go through those motions.
2761217	2764421	Actually to the DS game that was on the DS.
2764461	2765883	What the hell was the Wii game then?
2766063	2767966	The Wii game was kind of the same damn thing.
2768106	2769107	Just New Super Mario Bros.
2769187	2769407	Wii.
2769788	2770789	Notice the Wii at the end.
2771870	2775094	That was actually the first game that made Dan think about getting a 3DS.
2775535	2776075	Confirmed.
2776115	2777117	I don't understand Nintendo.
2778277	2781722	Well, all you have to understand is they took the game and they made some new levels.
2782683	2788330	And made some blinged out characters because there's a level with all gold characters for some reason.
2789432	2790213	Oh, and spider webs.
2790794	2791415	That must be new.
2791775	2791995	Right?
2792877	2793177	I don't know.
2793938	2822818	by the way I want to point out Alan has paraded out here just to hand me to do nothing but he hasn't even been sitting here he's been sitting in the back room playing Mass Effect he walked out here specifically just to hand me the DS cartridge of New Super Mario Brothers as if to say here dumbass thank you honey thank you thank you I learned so much being with you I'm putting this up on our on our page
2823934	2824815	New Super Mario Bros.
2825135	2827057	It's kind of weird that it's coming out in August.
2828379	2832683	So that means that Nintendo does have something else that they're going to be releasing for the fourth quarter.
2832863	2833284	Oh, I know!
2833324	2834145	It's a new console!
2834185	2834685	That's it!
2834766	2835907	That's what they're releasing.
2836528	2840332	That and probably Animal Crossing because Animal Crossing is somewhat cracky.
2841113	2841433	I don't know.
2842579	2849402	But yeah, anyways, as I was alluding to earlier, I believe that the Wii Mario game that we're going to be putting out is going to be New Super Mario Bros.
2850543	2864389	2 for the Wii U. And that you're going to be able to integrate, or not integrate, but play the game on your 3DS and on your console because the 3DS, they will probably announce, will actually be able to link up with your Wii U to...
2865973	2866113	Yep.
2884372	2888876	Except the new 3DS that they probably will announce that will have two analog sticks and not just one.
2889757	2891979	Let's hope and no attachment later on, please.
2892779	2893920	That would kind of piss me off.
2894100	2895522	Especially if it's exclusive to GameStop.
2895542	2896062	Quickie poll.
2896683	2896863	What?
2897183	2898584	Kuriboh's shoe or Hammer Brothers suit?
2899205	2900486	Kuriboh's shoe all the way.
2901006	2902608	That was like the raddest power-up ever.
2902848	2904129	The Hammer Brothers suit sucks.
2905010	2906070	It's Frog Mario.
2906231	2907552	Actually, Frog Mario sucks too.
2907572	2907892	Frog Mario sucks.
2907892	2910454	FrogMario is balls unless you're in an underwater level.
2910855	2912136	I will say that it is a challenge.
2912817	2917862	If somebody can beat the game with FrogMario through the level 8 worlds, color me impressed.
2917982	2921285	FrogMario actually is very good in one of the level 8 ones, the battleships.
2922446	2922947	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2940146	2943089	Why hasn't that made it into Mario Kart as a power-up?
2944370	2945952	Just a big shoe that stomps on enemies?
2945972	2946552	Yeah, exactly.
2946712	2948834	Just like your cart turns into the shoe.
2948894	2950656	Oh, yeah, your cart.
2950696	2951637	That's an awesome power-up.
2951657	2957623	Your cart turns into the shoe, and it just flies ahead and stomps on whoever's in front of you, and you just take off from there.
2957803	2958844	That's awesome.
2959164	2959625	Oh, my God.
2959685	2960225	Nintendo.
2960485	2961086	Patent pending.
2961366	2961827	Can't do it.
2962347	2963208	Nintendo, hire us.
2963468	2963869	Hire us.
2963949	2964329	Hire us.
2964349	2964710	Hire us.
2964730	2965070	Hire us.
2968410	2969132	It would be a cool idea.
2969153	2971420	Confirm next week OLR on the Nintendo Network.
2971460	2972223	I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
2972724	2972965	Kidding.
2973386	2974069	Put the hate mail down.
2976701	2982223	Yeah, and then last thing, the 3DS is finally getting with iOS and everybody else.
2982363	2987065	You know, hey, they've figured out, you know, you might like to sort your icons that you have.
2987685	2995167	So they're going to have a new addition to the home menu where you can create folders and store up to 60 icons within each folder.
2995287	2997368	So that is awesome.
2997388	3000369	You can actually kind of sort your games and whatnot.
3002330	3002610	Neat.
3003111	3003812	I like that idea.
3004212	3004693	It's needed.
3004893	3006235	That'll become an April 25th.
3006815	3008297	The Things I Don't Play folder.
3008938	3014164	Let's have that for all the little NES games and the Game Boy Advance games I downloaded because they were free and I don't play them.
3015145	3016626	There are some I do play, but some I don't.
3018048	3018168	So.
3021184	3023047	Anyhow, let's move on with some more news.
3023107	3033242	You know, there's a lot of great Nintendo happy-go-lucky news this week, but somebody's not so happy-go-lucky about what's going on in Nintendo, and that would be Trent Oster.
3034144	3034644	Who is he?
3034724	3035805	He's with BeamDog.
3035845	3039588	And he went to Twitter this week to say, Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition?
3040249	3047695	Not coming to the Wii U. Ironically, I never would have thought that game was coming to the Wii U. Yeah, I'm like, I never would have put it.
3047755	3054220	But, you know, for whatever reason, he was asked, and he said, We don't do Nintendo development.
3054860	3060745	Previous experience with Nintendo was enough to ensure there will not be another Nintendo project.
3061425	3062486	Oh, no, he didn't.
3064328	3068470	He just basically said, worked with Nintendo before, not going to happen again.
3068810	3070971	Apparently it has to do with MDK2.
3071051	3072972	You remember MDK from back in the day?
3072992	3073813	There was MDK2.
3074153	3075314	It was supposed to be WiiWare.
3075654	3080376	There was a 6,000 unit sales requirement before the developer gets payment.
3082017	3083458	I can see where that's kind of crappy.
3083778	3088361	Also had to do with trying to get a 400 meg game down to 40 megs with WiiWare, you know.
3089035	3093219	I can see where, you know, if you don't like the rules, then I'm going to take my ball and go somewhere else.
3093239	3093880	That's fine.
3094040	3106752	They honestly need to, like, you know, rethink their whole strategy with their online games because they are a little bit restrictive and, you know, the exposure on WiiWare isn't very good.
3107472	3114735	Well, this whole Nintendo Direct before E3 is very interesting to me, because E3 is only, what, about six weeks away at this point?
3115255	3123998	And for Nintendo to have this kind of a major press conference before E3 is very interesting, because these are games they very easily could have kept in their hat until E3, with the exception of the firmware update.
3124358	3125919	That's really the only thing that's happening now.
3126559	3128361	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3149139	3149900	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3163257	3164358	Zelda in 2013, maybe
3183677	3203236	well also one thing I wanted to say is that one thing that Nintendo didn't detail here that they're going to have to detail at E3 is the Nintendo Network we still don't really know I mean we've heard some little things about it we don't really know what that entails and I think E3 is going to be a big reveal for that and they don't know either I wouldn't put it past them
3205922	3209204	So hey guys, we have this poll on our website.
3209644	3213347	We want you to vote on what exactly you want the Nintendo Network to be.
3214107	3215748	Breakman in chat makes a pretty good point.
3215808	3220511	Spoiler alert, Gears of War 4 also not going to be on the Wii U. Sorry everyone.
3223652	3228513	That's true, and you probably won't see God of War coming to the Wii U anytime soon either.
3228853	3229913	It's just the way these things work.
3230873	3240535	Halo 4, not on the Wii U. That's right, not on the Wii U. Not on the Wii U. Until there's... Someday, one of them's going to gobble the other up.
3240635	3241055	Just wait.
3241735	3242535	It's just like Sega.
3242855	3245636	Who would have thought Sega would be publishing on a Nintendo platform?
3245656	3246216	That's right.
3247156	3250437	Minds were blown when Sonic showed up on the NES system.
3250457	3251197	It was crazy.
3251986	3252366	I cried.
3253667	3253807	Aww.
3254307	3254647	Not really.
3255548	3256288	Alright, moving on.
3256708	3257188	DarkSakura.
3257449	3260870	Well, Final Fantasy XIV, they're desperate.
3261090	3265472	They really, really, really, really want everyone to come back.
3266292	3267493	They're just crying over it.
3268533	3275897	So basically, anyone who has an inactive Final Fantasy XIV account can come back for a 10-day free trial next month, according to Squeenix.
3277918	3290464	I said it's going to be free of charge between the 10th and 21st of May with a new job system, 7th Umbral Era content and new gameplay that has a new update.
3292865	3296267	And then for the people that are still playing, they're getting some goodies.
3296347	3315098	Anyone who's been subscribed for 90 days between January 6th and the 2.0 beta testing gets their subscription released to, well, this is in pounds because I'm reading off a British article, to £6.89 down from £8.99.
3316939	3319320	And they are legacy subscribers and they get a new Chocobo.
3319360	3319500	Ooh.
3320421	3320761	Ooh.
3323067	3326589	But they're also still cutting down on their servers, so they're desperate.
3327610	3328070	Desperate!
3329111	3333874	The problem is, though, who cares that they're offering a free comeback and try us for 10 days?
3334074	3335795	Because it's not the 2.0 update yet!
3335815	3337176	That doesn't happen until the fall!
3337396	3339477	So why do I want to play your half-finished game?
3339617	3345141	Well, to be fair, I mean, I give Final Fantasy XIV its fair share of shit.
3345341	3346001	I did play it.
3346262	3347903	I did play it for a while, so I can speak.
3349183	3351865	as a former player, as someone who would be directly impacted by this.
3352745	3361270	They have put some things into the game already that were needed, and that was Final Fantasy classes that people understand, to put it lightly.
3361650	3371055	Like now instead of Thaumaturge and Conjurer, you can path to Black Mage and White Mage, and some of those changes are actually pretty exciting.
3371835	3372776	Not enough to get me back.
3373856	3374616	Well, I should say...
3375777	3380838	You know, if it's going to be free for 10 days, if I'm not... What weekend is this happening again?
3381078	3382559	I kind of shut my brain off for a minute.
3382919	3383159	Crap.
3383319	3384079	Let me look back at it.
3384759	3389460	It says it is the 10th and 21st of May.
3390301	3391241	See, here's the problem.
3392441	3393782	What's happening on the 15th of May?
3394842	3395462	Disneyland?
3396602	3397002	For you.
3397062	3398943	What's happening on the 15th of May for everybody else?
3399949	3400650	Max Payne 3.
3400910	3402711	Diablo 3, people.
3403432	3405413	Diablo 3 is on May 15th.
3406694	3410236	Do you think I give a shit about Final Fantasy 14 while I'm in the middle of Diablo 3?
3410276	3413739	Why does this make me think of Cabela's and the Halo 3 launch?
3414039	3415140	So let's be real.
3415200	3418362	There's really a four-day window to play Final Fantasy 14.
3418642	3419823	Just keeping it real, folks.
3421324	3424506	And so maybe if it's not because, you know...
3425527	3431692	If the patch is 7 gigs, I have to think about, oh, I have a 250 gig through Comcast, and I gotta download Diablo.
3431952	3433774	I hate that I have to fucking think about that, but I do.
3434434	3437517	So, you know, if it's reasonable, I'll check it out.
3437857	3438197	Why not?
3438738	3439258	If it's free.
3440979	3442741	But I kind of don't think it's gonna sway my opinion.
3443789	3447450	Porkchop in our chatroom asks, does Final Fantasy XIV have much of a soundtrack?
3447990	3448690	Yeah, it's decent.
3449130	3456272	I believe Nobuo Imatsu did a large chunk of the tracks, which is strange because he didn't really do XI's soundtrack at all except the theme.
3456412	3457552	Just bring XI free-to-play.
3457953	3459033	That's all you need to do.
3459473	3459833	Right?
3460213	3462194	All you need is XI free-to-play, I'd be there.
3462574	3463854	I would be there today.
3463934	3465535	You know why XI can't go free-to-play?
3466295	3467975	It's the Japanese user base on PlayStation 2.
3468575	3470896	How can you have a free-to-play game on the PlayStation 2 at this point?
3471676	3472036	You can't.
3472096	3472796	Cut him out.
3474317	3474537	Okay.
3475437	3476217	No, seriously.
3476317	3477397	How long is the PlayStation?
3477497	3478198	Okay, fine.
3478358	3481238	The PlayStation 2 still has some game coming out.
3481258	3484719	To be fair, there's like five people on Xbox 360 too.
3484779	3485599	Let's not forget that.
3485639	3486500	That was a pretty big deal.
3486820	3487680	Oh, yeah.
3487860	3491141	Let's keep them up for the five people that play on Xbox 360.
3491321	3494501	Oh, but all those people that play EA Sports MMA, fuck them.
3494601	3496322	Or Need for Speed, ah, fuck them too.
3496702	3497282	You know what?
3497362	3500843	All those five people that are playing Final Fantasy, who gives a shit?
3501383	3501883	You know what?
3501923	3505566	Tell them, listen, go download the PC client for free because it's free to fucking play!
3506687	3507087	You know what?
3507147	3508368	Some people, though, do like that.
3508488	3511070	I mean, like, we have Ikuma right now saying that it's good now.
3512431	3517354	I mean, okay, if you have a PlayStation 2 and you're still playing on that game, get a new PC!
3517594	3523758	I mean, come on, a PC from, like, a few years... Shit, you could probably get a PC from, like... What is it?
3523878	3526320	How long has it been since I've been playing Final Fantasy XI?
3526380	3527060	Like, ten years?
3527100	3527641	Ten years?
3528755	3529135	It's been a while.
3529355	3530256	Okay, come on.
3530376	3540220	If you can't afford a PC from like 10 years ago, what the... It hasn't been 10 years because the show is 10 years old and the Final Fantasy XI thing started.
3540280	3540780	Okay, fine.
3540800	3541441	Like a couple years ago.
3541481	3543362	Five to seven years ago, okay?
3543862	3544802	Five to seven years ago.
3544822	3547744	I literally am throwing away computers from that time.
3547984	3550145	I will give you a computer for free.
3550405	3553006	The computer that the show is broadcast from could play Final Fantasy XI.
3553066	3554246	Oh, I mean, fuck.
3554487	3556628	Probably this Vita could play Final Fantasy XI.
3556668	3557248	That was a rumor.
3557768	3558089	Remember?
3558370	3558951	That was a rumor.
3558971	3560054	They really knew to do that.
3560074	3560555	That was a rumor.
3560655	3561357	I would buy that.
3561698	3562640	I would buy that shit.
3562821	3563964	Well, maybe not on the Vita, because I mean...
3564969	3565889	No, I'd still buy that.
3566249	3568390	But I'm telling you, Final Fantasy XI would be awesome.
3568430	3569351	Who cares about XIV?
3569391	3569871	Just listen.
3569971	3570991	Okay, it didn't work out.
3571131	3572432	We're going to make it free to play.
3573072	3577854	To make it up, we're going to maybe revamp a little bit of Final Fantasy XI and make it free to play.
3577874	3590838	There is too much pride for Square Enix, the makers of Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy to say, we're going to open this up free to play and have to take that big old slice of humble pie.
3591359	3592599	It ain't happening anytime soon.
3595126	3595726	I'll wait.
3596087	3599069	I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing for your MMO to take that path.
3599369	3601550	Why can't Final Fantasy go down the path of Guild Wars?
3602170	3602771	Anyway, forget it.
3603371	3604472	Because they're Squeenix.
3604892	3605493	Let's move on.
3605533	3606253	They don't do that.
3606573	3612357	Let's talk about games that are really existing in a store near you very soon as we travel around the world and look at some release dates.
3612877	3613798	Yay!
3615256	3626018	Alright, so this week it's Prototype 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and on 360, Phantom Breaker Special Edition.
3627950	3630711	Shinsengoku Musou Versus
3657197	3658298	Vita, Seal No Surge, Ushinarwatiya
3676852	3688876	Wareta, sorry, Hoshi i Sasagushi comes out this week in normal and agent packs, as well as Next Revolution comes out for Media 5 this week.
3688956	3690176	Those are both on the Vita.
3691416	3697498	And checking out the consoles real quick, going to the PlayStation 3, Biohazard, Operation Raccoon City.
3697818	3702700	You get a special headset bundle for Operation Raccoon City, the game itself.
3703180	3703720	It's coming out.
3704480	3706421	And Loki's saying, don't fall for it, it sucks.
3707248	3713950	Also, what's very interesting, Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, Game of the Year Edition, finally coming out on PlayStation 3.
3715031	3718152	Fallout 3, Game of the Year Edition, finally coming out on PlayStation 3.
3718192	3719112	Is that a new Idolmaster?
3719252	3720573	I think those are price reductions.
3721133	3725315	And yes, the Idolmaster Graveur for You, Volume 7.
3725355	3727095	I think this is more an expansion for Idolmaster.
3727115	3728896	I don't think it's like an actual full...
3729576	3738721	I'm guessing that those are getting a price reduction because there was just recently a combo pack with Fallout 3 and Oblivion for like $29.99 or something.
3739201	3740262	That could be here in the States?
3740422	3740602	Yeah.
3740742	3741142	That could be.
3741322	3743544	That was on 360, but I can see them dropping prices.
3744124	3746925	Oddly enough, 360 is pretty busy this week in Japan.
3747085	3749407	Operation Raccoon City Biohazard is out there as well.
3749547	3749867	Sucks.
3750147	3753469	Cybertroopers Virtual On Force gets the Platinum reduction.
3753529	3754209	Yeah, I know, right?
3754509	3755810	Who knew Virtual On was still going?
3756112	3762476	I think that's the arcade game plus they're throwing in the tournament stick or that arcade stick that goes with it.
3762636	3763016	Need.
3763236	3767459	Dodonpachi Resurrection Black Label and it's a cave game is out this week.
3767479	3768319	That's probably a price reduction.
3768339	3769380	There's going to be a double pack.
3769840	3771301	Yeah, because it's called Cave Selection.
3772141	3774983	Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition also on the Xbox 360.
3775243	3776184	It's Dodonpachi.
3776404	3779206	The Dodonpachi Resurrection came out like what, six months ago?
3779226	3779626	Yeah.
3780137	3782739	You saw that Akai Katana is coming out next month.
3783299	3783900	No, I missed that.
3783960	3785321	The new shmup.
3785341	3787302	Yeah, it's a new shmup.
3787362	3789703	It's actually one that's actually formatted for widescreen.
3790284	3794287	The first cave game for widescreen, HD TVs, all done in HD.
3794407	3795207	Well done.
3795808	3796368	About time.
3796668	3797629	And it's coming out in the States.
3800110	3800611	You know what?
3800991	3803172	There's actually a game that's in talks with Square.
3803192	3809837	I don't know if we have it in anything in the show, but actually one thing I am interested that's coming out, hopefully, that Square is doing is a sequel to The World Ends With You.
3810959	3812505	Yes, I heard about that.
3812766	3813529	They're supposed to be doing that.
3813971	3814573	Good times.
3815115	3815898	Comes out December.
3818306	3818926	Oh, really?
3819487	3821867	No, I'm just saying, wouldn't that be funny because of the Mayan calendar?
3821887	3825929	Oh, I thought that was one of your little, like, Loki tips slipping in there.
3826089	3831791	It's just funny because I don't think that our December on the Gregorian calendar would have been the end of their year.
3833292	3834392	Actually, a little bit of trivia.
3834833	3837974	On the lunar calendar for the Jewish calendar, we actually don't have a leap year.
3837994	3840935	We have a leap month every, I think, 13 years.
3841635	3842235	So, just saying.
3843036	3843816	I want a whole month.
3843896	3844936	We have a whole extra month.
3844956	3846117	Do you have to work in that month?
3846517	3846677	No.
3847118	3847739	Good times.
3847759	3849321	Well, I mean, it's normal stuff.
3849701	3850883	You don't work on Shabbat.
3850943	3853767	Who would run the world then if we didn't work for a whole month?
3855289	3857612	You know, the Jew... Anarchy!
3859174	3859955	Moving on, UK...
3861127	3876933	24th of April we have FIFA 12, UFA Euro 12 The Walking Dead and Prototype 2 there's a game that actually came out on my birthday that I think has a funny name and I have no idea what it's about but it makes me think of Benicula as Botanicula
3878490	3881171	I don't know if anyone ever remembers a book about the vegetarian vampire rabbit.
3883152	3886153	On the 26th of April is Deus Ex Human Revolution.
3886593	3891055	On the 27th, Binary Domain, Blazing Souls, Accolade, or is it Accelate?
3891515	3891815	I don't know.
3892635	3895356	And Risen 2, Dark Waters.
3897217	3897737	That would be it.
3899778	3900218	The Saw.
3901636	3908902	Alright, so I don't know if I should be happy about this, but I guess a company doing well, great.
3909242	3913745	THQ, their forecast for their earnings has improved.
3914786	3918689	They're saying that now they're reporting a net sales from $160 million to $170 million.
3922298	3927082	And of course the previous update was from 130 to 150.
3928383	3930764	So what can this be attributed to?
3931165	3938230	Well, it's due to the fact that people have been dumb enough to buy the fucking DLC for Saints Row the Third.
3939411	3942473	And I am proud to say that I am not one of those people.
3942733	3949018	I made the mistake once purchasing one of their content packs or expansions, whatever you want to call it.
3950481	3951281	And it sucked.
3951801	3953522	It was 30 minutes of content for $8.
3955122	3955483	I'm sorry, $7.
3955523	3959804	And I just said fuck it.
3959824	3960764	It's cheaper than a hooker.
3963245	3965466	30 minutes, yeah, that is cheaper than a hooker.
3966046	3968407	But it's definitely not as satisfying.
3968447	3969247	Not as much payoff.
3971027	3972388	When did you start pricing hookers?
3974429	3975050	Don't get me started.
3975070	3976951	Is there something for your birthday I didn't hear about?
3977391	3980413	No, I actually... Nothing.
3980753	3983254	This comes from the episode last week's Supernatural.
3984115	3984555	Of course.
3984595	3985616	I was a fancy lady.
3985776	3986436	What, a hooker?
3987577	3988017	Dot, dot, dot.
3988037	3989538	Well, I mean, come on.
3989798	3993381	You have to know that you have to factor in the HMV into everything.
3993421	3997323	I mean, everything's based off the HME, which is the hooker market value.
3997683	4002986	And if you don't know what the hooker market value is, how are you going to know how to price your other goods that are based off the HMV?
4004287	4007009	I'm telling you, this is just street smarts.
4007089	4007809	I mean, seriously.
4008829	4014492	So, yes, it's really unfortunate that people were dumb enough to buy this.
4014733	4017094	And most of which was paid unlocked content, by the way.
4017494	4021696	In fact, they're still putting out little costumes and bullshit that was in the game.
4023557	4026899	Sadly, though, if they put out a sequel to this game, I'm probably not going to have to buy it.
4026919	4028360	Because I do remember earlier...
4029140	4052298	Um, well, a couple weeks ago while we were out, or while I was out, a certain idiot from, um, I'm not really sure if he works for THQ or Volition, I believe he works for THQ, was complaining about, you know, I'm not getting enough money from use games, and so, of course, he had to be the first person to enter my list of, hey, I'm
4052578	4058000	If you complain about used game sales and not making anything off of it, I'm going to boycott your game.
4058440	4069523	So, Richard Brown, the first inductee into that list, who had worked on many things, including Saints Row III, unfortunately, I am now going to have to be forced not to purchase any more games.
4069683	4071424	Are you seriously boycotting Saints Row IV?
4071504	4072084	I don't believe it.
4072204	4073105	I do not believe it.
4073365	4074205	I'm not buying the game new.
4076506	4077806	They will not get any of my new money.
4078466	4080927	We'll wait until that first trailer is out and I'll ask you again.
4082501	4090686	But yes, he has worked on many games, including Homefront, Ren Faction, Armageddon, Saints for the Third, Stacking, Warhammer 40k, WWE All-Stars.
4090726	4094148	He's basically, I think he's like a producer or something like that over at THQ.
4094648	4097790	He backs the money for this stuff.
4099611	4108696	So yes, and of course he came out bitching about how, you know, oh, they need used game sales because all these excuses.
4109516	4109857	I don't know.
4109937	4112058	I don't even really want to go into detail about it, but...
4114582	4115662	It's just, it's annoying.
4116443	4120624	Oh, he talked about the real cost of used games and smuggle bastard.
4121884	4122884	Blah, blah, blah.
4123024	4123665	Blah, blah, blah.
4123945	4124325	Who cares?
4125585	4132287	Well, everybody has Kickstarter fever in the States anyway because, you know, they don't really have anything like it overseas.
4132567	4134368	Because, you know, by the way, I got to say this.
4134428	4138409	There was a great Penny Arcade article on Kickstarter this week about how
4138869	4139789	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4167779	4170181	I mean, there is a little bit of the financial end.
4170201	4173843	You have to have people that manage your money, your marketing, and all that stuff.
4173863	4176124	You can't just go make game, make money.
4176204	4178625	I mean, it's a little bit more complex than that.
4179926	4180166	All right.
4181287	4183668	Just a quick note for the podcast folks.
4184249	4188391	Apparently, our live listeners lost us, but we show we're still connected and uploading data to the feed.
4188471	4191373	So we're going to just keep right on moving.
4191912	4199094	All right, so anyhow, Kickstarter, yes, there is an alternative to Kickstarter called Gambitious.
4199414	4202615	Now, this is how the folks overseas are going to get into this.
4203416	4207637	European indie developers will get this opportunity to use this.
4207677	4208977	There are some differences.
4209197	4210318	This is a Dutch company.
4211218	4214819	They will be filling the crowdfunding void by using their own service.
4215519	4217740	You won't be donating funds to receive gifts.
4218120	4221381	You're actually going to purchase shares of a game's development.
4221621	4223663	So it's almost like a little mini stock market or something.
4223943	4231389	When the game is completed, the user gets dividends like a traditional investor rather than a copy of a game or a lunch date or whatever it is that you're doing.
4231409	4232050	That's kind of cool.
4232710	4234532	It's different.
4235113	4237454	It's a very smart British way of thinking about it.
4237835	4238595	I like it.
4238656	4239977	I wish they would do something like that over here.
4239997	4241498	That'd be kind of cool.
4244240	4244800	Very strange.
4246221	4246541	All right.
4247462	4252206	So let's move on to a segment we like to do every week here on the show.
4252846	4253627	I know we're not live.
4253707	4255869	We still have a big group that listens to us on the podcast.
4256109	4259531	And for the record, they say that the play button's got to slash through it.
4259692	4261393	I just went to the site and it looks fine to me.
4261960	4263221	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
4290427	4301554	The game is Kid Icarus, also known in Japan as Hikari Shinwa Palutena no Kagami, which is Light Mythology Palutena's Mirror.
4301755	4310280	It is an action platform game that came out on the Famicom Disk System in Japan and cartridge in US and North America and in Europe.
4310420	4311021	Sorry, that's what I meant.
4312821	4323946	It was the very first Kid Icarus game, and it came out in Japan in December 1986, and in Europe and North America in February and July 1987 respectively.
4324746	4328508	We had a GBA version in 2004, a Wii Virtual Console version in 2007,
4329808	4339718	and the sequel that came out on Game Boy in 1991 and of course the third version that came out on Nintendo 3DS in March 2012.
4340439	4344163	Which, having played a little bit of it, loved it, won it, oh my god.
4344383	4344783	So anyway.
4345864	4358549	So basically, you are Pit, who is a cute little angel, trying to find the three sacred treasures, which he has to use to rescue their goddess of angel land, Palutena.
4359770	4364432	You basically go through different areas where you can scroll up, and you've got your little...
4366272	4372336	Dungeon levels where you have to go on kind of like a grid map type thing and it's really a neat little game.
4374678	4391769	You basically have to reach the end of the levels, defeat the monster that guards the three treasures and it actually was done by Nintendo's Research and Development 1 division that meant it was designed by Toru Asawa and Yoshio Sakamoto and directed by Satoru Okada.
4392289	4393250	And you know who produced it?
4394090	4394771	Gunpei Yokoi.
4395831	4396652	Who is the man?
4397373	4403557	So, um, it actually had kind of mixed reception when it came out.
4403597	4405298	There were people that did not like it.
4405978	4409641	But it's, you know, been a classic to everyone since.
4411342	4415645	The Game Boy version that came out was Kid Icarus of Myths and Monsters in 1991.
4416085	4418106	And then we had to wait for 20 years.
4418767	4421949	So now we have Kid Icarus Uprising and everything's cool.
4422349	4424511	But hey, we still have Pit in Super Smash Bros.
4424531	4424751	Ball.
4426232	4428614	So basically with this one, like I said, it is a platformer.
4429595	4437341	You go through different levels and you collect health, you collect hearts, which you can use to buy stuff.
4438082	4439883	And you also have a score.
4441144	4446006	Now, as you go through that, you can go through different chambers that sometimes they're a market.
4446906	4450568	And sometimes you have to defeat certain monsters.
4450588	4457890	You have a god's chamber where your bow and arrow can be increased in strength by different factors.
4458811	4465113	And sometimes it depends on how many enemies you've defeated or how much damage you've taken in battle.
4465133	4467434	And then you also have a training chamber where
4467874	4471996	where you can get one of three power items if you pass the test.
4472876	4477058	So then you have, basically you've got the three stages, the underworld, the surface, and the sky world.
4477858	4483401	And they have the different levels and the fortress.
4484501	4491985	And all the first levels are, the underworld and sky stages are basically ones where you're going bottom to top.
4492585	4494886	And then the last one is a side-scrolling level.
4496243	4496883	The surface world.
4496923	4497964	Sorry, it's side-scrolling.
4499644	4504866	The fortresses are non-scrolling rooms, and you have to find and defeat the gatekeeper.
4505766	4511428	So you can buy a check sheet, a pencil, and a torch so that you can basically track yourself on your map.
4512669	4518311	And you can get a hammer that destroys statues, which will free a flying soldier called a centurion that will aid you in boss battles.
4519531	4522933	And then when each of the bosses are destroyed, you get one of the sacred treasures.
4523173	4523753	Blah, blah, blah.
4525433	4530837	and the last portion are kind of like a scrolling shooter.
4531037	4531777	So it's pretty interesting.
4532958	4544586	So the game, like I said, was done by a Nintendo's R&D1 division which was actually the programming was done by an outside company called Intelligent Systems.
4545266	4554933	It was meant for the disc system because with the disc card you could have three times the storage capacity than the NES cartridges.
4555833	4560356	And then it also could save your progress, given that it was on a floppy disk.
4561557	4574986	Of course, when it came out on the Nintendo in the US, it was on a cartridge with a password system.
4577628	4578108	So, uh...
4579856	4583378	This, a lot went into the creation of this game, actually.
4583518	4590241	It was even said that, um, all of the, uh, the pixel art was drawn by, um, Otsawa himself.
4590662	4591302	That's pretty cool.
4593123	4604109	So, um, it was re-released in, um, 19, uh, sorry, in 2004 in Japan as the Famicom Mini Disk System Selection for the GBA.
4604709	4606390	And, of course, we got it on the Virtual Console in 2007.
4606430	4606470	Um...
4610572	4612793	You know, remember the cheat codes, Rob?
4614655	4615015	I do.
4615095	4617917	Wasn't there like Medusa fights Icarus angels or vice versa?
4617937	4620018	Icarus fights Medusa angels.
4620478	4622259	And there was terror, danger, horror.
4622419	4622720	Yes.
4623520	4626062	They took that out of the 3DS remake, if you can believe it.
4626362	4626962	Yeah, they did.
4627002	4628563	That's what I was leading up to.
4628583	4629504	Oh, my bad.
4630084	4644769	But, um, there were, uh, when, uh, there was, uh, the eShop version of the download code that was given to those who registered two 3DS games, um, with Nintendo in Japan and Europe, or pre-ordered Kid Icarus Uprisings.
4645569	4647430	So, that was pretty neat.
4648770	4649150	Boo to them!
4670059	4672600	Part of it had to do with their rather dated graphics.
4674782	4688152	But it was said in Retro Gamer, which is a magazine that Dan and I pick up sometimes, that it was the unsung hero of the NES, looks and sounds pretty, and said that the music is sublime and the enemy characters are brilliantly drawn.
4688912	4691334	Which I have to agree with every single last bit of that.
4691994	4692655	Now, um...
4694854	4701876	JeremyParishWithOneUp.com said that it was a fairly forgotten masterpiece and that it was underwhelming, buggy, and annoying.
4702656	4703196	You know what?
4703377	4704077	I say shut up.
4705217	4705737	Agreed.
4707118	4707958	It really is.
4708178	4709238	Now, I will say this.
4709978	4711759	That game is freaking hard as fuck.
4713038	4713959	Thanks for watching!
4734389	4738493	and we've even seen Pit in Tetris, remember when you win on the harder levels?
4739274	4740955	He pops up on the little win screen.
4742677	4745420	F1 Race and Super Smash Bros.
4745480	4748282	Melee and he was a playable character in Super Smash Bros.
4748322	4751685	Brawl and they completely redesigned his appearance for that game.
4753030	4755672	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4783427	4784148	You know what I liked?
4784188	4786129	What I used to do in this one when you get turned into an eggplant?
4786669	4789031	Is I would hold down and then slide across the floor as an eggplant.
4789512	4789752	Yes.
4789872	4790913	You couldn't see his little legs.
4791813	4792474	Ah, that was the best.
4795776	4804202	But basically, they revealed Kid Icarus Uprising in E3 2010 and sent me a 3D shooter that was developed by Project Sora.
4805463	4811628	That's the same company that the Smash Bros.
4811648	4814390	designer Masahiro Sakurai is from.
4815711	4817232	It kind of does go back to that.
4819591	4821793	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4839772	4842895	and had a reverse difficulty curve.
4843315	4846038	Basically, you can play it 16-bit on your web browser.
4847118	4850661	I don't know what became of that, because honestly, that's the first I had ever heard of it.
4851362	4852863	But now I kind of want to find it and play it.
4853584	4854965	So that's our game, Kid Icarus.
4857307	4860289	All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Kid Icarus on the NES.
4860489	4863452	I just think that the original name is pretty cool, though.
4864533	4866915	I do, I like that too.
4867475	4868216	Light Mythology.
4869652	4869973	All right.
4870753	4872454	We don't know what's going on with the live feed.
4872614	4874035	We're still showing that we're sending data.
4874115	4876777	Apparently, the server itself is down.
4877357	4880680	So we don't know what's up.
4880700	4886964	According to folks in chat, this seems to be like a legit server crash that's happening, what have you.
4887044	4887945	So we don't know what's up.
4887965	4889926	We're going to need to take a little bit of a break here.
4892901	4896265	We're going to go ahead and play music anyway, even though the podcasters won't hear it.
4896606	4900591	But at least it's a chance for us to take a break and figure out how we're going to broadcast Part B. We'll be right back.
4907228	4909790	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
4909870	4914293	We are live, sorta, on this Sunday evening, April the 22nd of 2012.
4916094	4918215	Just what's going on for the live folks real quick.
4918916	4924259	We flipped it to Ustream, which obviously you're figuring this out if you're connecting to the feed right now.
4924419	4926881	And if you see, yes, that video really is live.
4927281	4928562	That's my little hand waving in front of it.
4928922	4930623	We're shy, so you get to look at Mr. Chocobo.
4933081	4934703	And I don't know what's going on with All Games.
4935443	4937605	I am still streaming to the All Games server.
4937685	4941909	I'm streaming to both right now, so this is going to be interesting to see if we can have the bandwidth for it.
4942309	4948435	But the All Games server crashed, or something happened, so we don't know what's up.
4948735	4958924	And guys, we suspect it's not... I realize there was a big announcement this week, and people are coming up with conspiracy theories, but we think if it was that, which would be...
4959384	4960405	Silly if it was that.
4961366	4967551	We would just have the access to stream to the feed taken away altogether because they know the IP we broadcast from.
4968032	4969213	So we don't think it's that.
4969313	4971134	It's just how ironic.
4971955	4972796	How ironic.
4973376	4974998	It's like rain on your wedding day.
4975899	4976299	There you go.
4977059	4979742	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4998599	4999900	Don't change anything.
4999960	5003142	You'll still get next week's show at the same time and all that good stuff.
5004543	5004783	All right.
5005663	5008425	Anyhow, let's try to move on with the show best we can.
5009346	5011487	We're going to move into some rapid fire news.
5011727	5011947	Sorry.
5012288	5016070	I guess DarkSakura's computer just crashed on top of everything else.
5016450	5018011	Won't anything work?
5018652	5021613	Why is technology... Because this is a piece of shit and my husband won't buy me an iPad.
5021773	5024395	Why is technology revolting against us?
5024455	5026176	It's like the fucking Terminator.
5026937	5027057	Yeah.
5029158	5030159	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5058316	5062458	Paint Park is basically a basic paint program.
5062998	5068680	You can take pictures of crap and draw and share it with your friends and do all that fun stuff.
5069080	5072301	Plus, I believe you can actually draw with friends, maybe?
5073241	5076182	And you can also use the rear touchpad and the front touchpad and all that fun stuff.
5076682	5078323	So that's neat.
5078624	5082967	Then later this summer, they're going to be introducing Treasure Park and Wake Up Call.
5084548	5093355	I guess Treasure Park is an app that lets you create your own puzzles and send them out to your friends using Near and I guess 3G.
5093876	5102963	And then also Wake Up Call is an alarm clock app that syncs with your alarm or syncs your alarm with other PlayStation Vita users.
5104491	5106453	I don't understand why you would want to do that.
5107073	5115540	And it says there's also a competitive element where players can set goals and are awarded for meeting or exceeding... I don't get it.
5115640	5116301	That's stupid.
5117702	5118523	Set your alarm.
5119043	5119484	Goal!
5120865	5121725	What's the point of that?
5121905	5123166	It doesn't make any sense.
5123807	5126289	Turning alarm clocks into a video game.
5126329	5126729	I'm not sure.
5128230	5131233	How quickly you answer the alarm, I don't understand.
5131713	5133315	I could use something like that, actually.
5133355	5135756	I'm the type of person that will hit the damn snooze for an hour.
5135857	5137098	So something to motivate me.
5137458	5138238	I set four alarms.
5139019	5140520	and actually get out of bed.
5140540	5145021	Ooh, a shiny sticker for my alarm clock park or whatever it's called.
5145121	5146802	But yeah, Paint Park is available right now.
5146842	5150504	It is free so you can check it out and play around with that.
5150544	5156506	Actually, I haven't turned my Vita on in a few weeks so I missed a lot of stuff on there.
5156586	5159207	I downloaded the Wipeout demo.
5159227	5161908	I want to check that out because people keep saying that's a good game to get.
5162288	5186008	and then also there's like some AR thing with resistance that you can play with and then there's that other free like puzzle game that they've got where I guess it's limited plays per day or something like that hey but it's free so you can try it and if it sucks you can delete it I still have to have an 8 gig card I still have to move everything over to but I haven't gotten a chance to do that yet so fun fun
5188035	5189175	Yeah.
5189255	5199279	Something else that's kind of cool DLC-wise, you know, LittleBigPlanet had a lot of cool DLC when it came out, and of course they're going to kind of continue on doing it with that LittleBigPlanet carting.
5200419	5208282	With pre-order, I'm assuming at major retailers, Amazon GameStop they're mentioning, you get free Kevin Butler DLC.
5208402	5210402	That's right, the fake VP himself.
5210843	5215344	You get the Sackboy costume and his golf cart to play.
5215384	5215804	DarkSakura,
5234722	5247118	Anyways, last but not least, there's a rumor, or I should say a campaign, sort of, to bring Archer, the FX animated series, to Pinball FX as a table.
5247759	5249140	And apparently this is...
5251368	5255729	came to fruition via some tweets from the Archer production designer.
5255849	5259510	I guess someone tweeted the Archer production designer and art director.
5260630	5264651	And then he's like, well, yeah, hey, that sounds like a cool idea.
5264671	5270813	If Zen Studios wants to do it, then I guess we can send the idea to FX and see if they're game for it.
5270833	5272874	And then Zen Studios is like, hell yeah, we'll do it.
5273454	5278315	And so now it's kind of in FX's hands to whether or not they were going to
5278795	5285537	Put the wheels in motion, I guess, and they're going to swap contact information and maybe we'll have an Archer table someday.
5285557	5287158	That'd be neat.
5287218	5288838	That would actually be all kinds of awesome.
5288918	5289999	I so support this idea.
5290539	5293360	Even though, if I recall correctly, Pinball FX has a spy table.
5294040	5294460	Who cares?
5294840	5296981	Archer's like ten times better than that.
5297281	5298261	It's sad.
5298461	5300562	I really wanted to like Archer, but I hate it.
5301022	5301302	What?
5302423	5303824	Archer's hilarious.
5303924	5304425	I hate it.
5304785	5305806	Oh my god, I hate you.
5305906	5306806	But here's the thing, though.
5307026	5308888	I hated The Office when I first watched it, too.
5309268	5313131	It's one of those things that you gotta go back later on and you're like, oh, this is funny.
5313371	5315813	Or like It's Always Sunny in Fel- No, actually, It's Always Sunny in Fel-
5316673	5318235	But it looks stupid.
5318275	5319776	It's Always Sunny looked terrible.
5320256	5320737	That's true.
5320797	5323720	The first time I watched It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, I hated it.
5323780	5326042	But now I think it's one of the most hilarious shows on TV.
5326122	5329425	So I'm willing to go back and try it again.
5329545	5332367	But it's just right now, I don't know.
5332387	5333008	I don't have time.
5333048	5335911	But I'll eventually go back and watch Archer and hopefully enjoy it.
5336931	5338452	Let me just quickly plug our chat room.
5338552	5340312	Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com.
5340432	5342753	I don't know if any stragglers are finding us through Ustream.
5342773	5343993	This is our backup right now.
5344333	5347614	The all-game server stopped responding, so we're continuing on with the show.
5347654	5349254	You can't stop us that easily, Internet.
5349714	5350655	So we're continuing on.
5351155	5353015	Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to chat with us.
5353095	5357056	I don't even know if the Ustream TV chat room is there, but if it is, we're not looking at it.
5357336	5364558	So you need to go to Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com to chat with us live as we're doing our little radio show on this Sunday evening.
5364998	5368062	Also, I want to open up the Ask Orange Lounge line.
5368502	5376292	Send a private message to Sky, S-K-I-E, in the chat room at chat.orangelounge.com if you have a question for Ask Orange Lounge.
5376432	5380056	And we're going to get to that shortly after a few more stories.
5380597	5380977	Quickly...
5381698	5387840	This is really sad, and this is something I think it happened on the week we were off, but we need to say it and tip our hat to this.
5388760	5392722	Jack Tramiel, he founded the company that created the Commodore 64.
5393942	5407187	He died at the age of 83, according to Forbes magazine, and if you grew up on the Commodore family of computers like I did, then Jack Tramiel was obviously somebody important to you, so rest in peace.
5408087	5436876	um going to a completely different topic here on Nintendo uh real quick I'm sorry I don't I didn't have a 64 but uh wasn't it like the command to like start a program or something like 80 something or load quote star quote comma eight comma one uh that would be ironic if it was four you know what there were um that was actually the same uh command on the Apple IIe wasn't no Apple for some of the games that I played it was
5437563	5439145	I thought Apple did something different.
5439205	5442148	It was similar, but it wasn't the star.
5442188	5443810	The star was unique to Commodore.
5443830	5444651	Comma 8, Comma 1.
5444951	5447394	Because Comma 8 is what called out the disk drive.
5447434	5449456	And I think if you had a tape drive, it was Comma 7.
5450477	5454682	I remember doing the Comma 8, Comma 1 on the Apple.
5454742	5455983	Are you sure you weren't playing the Comma?
5456003	5456504	For Lode Runner.
5458533	5458773	All right.
5458793	5460255	Well, Lode Runner was multi-platform.
5460295	5461697	But anyway, let's move on.
5461938	5464962	I'm talking about Miyamoto being a damn tease.
5465703	5473453	Miyamoto had a conversation with Edge at edgeonline.com and yeah, he was talking about some first party stuff because that
5473473	5474033	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5501541	5506184	Now, you know, this has led to rampant speculation and internet wank about the whole thing.
5506644	5517389	But, I mean, I love the idea of a new Link to the Past, but, hold on, wasn't Zelda Four Swords on the GameCube kind of a redo of the Link to the Past?
5517650	5521652	It's not like that idea hasn't been touched since the Super Nintendo days.
5521672	5522252	That's not true.
5522292	5526214	The Game Boy Advance games and the portable games were really like that until it went all Wind Waker.
5526554	5527875	I do have to make a rebuttal real quick.
5527975	5528075	What?
5528095	5529656	I was thinking of my cousin's Commodore 64.
5531175	5531716	Ah, okay.
5531736	5531916	Sorry.
5532096	5532597	That's alright.
5533818	5544791	It would mean, to me, I think he's looking at kind of like doing the new Super Mario approach to it where basically they kind of do an updated engine but kind of old school play style.
5545251	5549276	So you would have like an updated engine but it would be a top down Zelda game kind of like it was.
5549836	5556061	But my god, put an editor in there, put a community feature where people can create their own quests and stuff like that.
5557001	5560204	You're talking like money in the bank right there.
5560224	5561425	I mean, it would be epic.
5561985	5569571	And it would be really something that Nintendo would kind of say, Hey, look, we understand the internet and community features and stuff like that.
5569611	5574034	Instead of pretending that you do or saying, Hey, now we can do updates.
5574495	5575956	You know, if our games are buggy.
5576616	5577357	We're with it.
5577497	5578137	We're cool.
5580919	5586042	Now, this is the other big part of this is that he was asked about F-Zero.
5586782	5587262	So excited.
5587402	5596528	And he did say this, quote, maybe with future hardware with Wii U coming up, maybe we could create something that does make sense either as a smaller game or a fully fledged title.
5597478	5598359	Yes, please.
5598639	5600821	But that's an interesting way for him to phrase it.
5601181	5602703	Either as a smaller game.
5603163	5607167	Could this be talking about like a Wii U-ware type of game?
5607507	5609089	Is that what we're talking about?
5609189	5610530	Or small as in portable?
5611311	5617196	There's a lot you can read into that and probably way more than Miyamoto intended anybody, but you will not calm the fanboy wank down.
5618397	5618978	Riddle me this.
5620479	5626302	So I'm assuming that this little tablet controller thing that they're going to put out is probably going to have some sort of ARM processor in there.
5626702	5629804	Something that can, you know, obviously render some video and that kind of stuff.
5630264	5633506	Well, a lot of these tablet devices are based off of certain ARM processors.
5633586	5637808	Could you, for example, and there are some other patents, which I don't know if we have a story on, but whatever.
5637828	5641710	You know, could you, for example, imagine that...
5642330	5643351	Hey, guess what?
5643411	5652554	Just like, you know, the Pocket Station or even like the Vita or something like that, you know, hey, you can take a version of your gaming experience on the road with you.
5652594	5658397	So, for example, like, hey, we're going to create like a virtual console app that runs on this tablet.
5658457	5658897	And guess what?
5658937	5659297	You know what?
5659337	5666740	Not only does a tablet stream your gameplay from the TV, but you can take that tablet with you and play on the road.
5669262	5670122	These, like, games.
5671795	5673857	Well, but there's the whole like streaming.
5674698	5676239	Well, it doesn't have to stream the content.
5676259	5678761	I'm saying that the processor would be able to render its own content.
5680883	5687129	And yes, you could do this also with the 3DS where you would have just a virtual console game or, you know, 3DS app or something like that.
5687630	5696578	But it would be kind of a neat way to get people interested because, well, then again, they would also kind of cut themselves in the knee by, you know,
5697987	5703031	Basically offering a portable system with a console system, but it might get people to buy the system.
5703971	5704412	Very true.
5705632	5709935	One more story for you guys before I turn it over to DarkSakura, and that is for you Bomani fans.
5709995	5710636	Where are you at?
5710896	5711276	Holla.
5712077	5712777	Beatmania2DX20.
5715599	5723805	or as I like to call it 20th style even though that pisses the hardcore off because this is really called Beatmania 2DX20 Tricoro is the name of the game.
5724125	5726266	Konami has confirmed it exists.
5726466	5727027	It exists.
5727267	5728308	It's called Tricoro.
5729188	5737914	The three color scheme is kind of what they're going with with the whole red, yellow, blue and location testing is underway April 19th through the 24th in Japan.
5738837	5740758	Happy birthday to me in Japan.
5741619	5742979	Right?
5743300	5743980	I'm going to be honest.
5744020	5749303	I haven't followed the Beatmania 2DX series since about... What style was like DJ Troopers?
5749423	5750324	Probably even before that.
5750384	5750984	Happy Sky.
5751004	5750984	12, 13.
5752285	5755306	I think the last one I actually touched was an Empress.
5756307	5756687	Oh, wow.
5756847	5758048	I didn't even play an Empress ever.
5758728	5760410	Oh, but they did have the PS2.
5760430	5760930	I keep forgetting.
5760950	5763052	They cranked out those PS2 games, right?
5763112	5764093	Empress was the last one.
5764713	5765434	I keep forgetting that.
5767316	5768196	Well, there you go, anyway.
5769497	5772480	2DX 20th is happening and it's location testing right now.
5772560	5773481	But Monty's not dead.
5774562	5775402	Not in Japan.
5776403	5778285	Well, there's a few other things.
5778345	5781668	How about some new Kinect games that are for kids?
5782288	5783950	Actually, I kind of want to get one of these.
5784630	5786172	Kinect Sesame Street TV.
5787938	5789880	It's got Cookie Monster and Groover!
5790260	5792021	There's no Elmo to be seen!
5792622	5793002	Yay.
5793803	5795504	But that's going to launch autumn 2012.
5795944	5800147	That's according to Argonaut CEO James Bustall.
5800708	5805591	And then there is Connect National Geographic, like NatGeoTV it says.
5806172	5808874	And that's being put up by C21 Media.
5809574	5810275	That's pretty cool.
5811136	5812517	I would get the Sesame Street one.
5812757	5813237	Just saying.
5813257	5813778	Yeah.
5814678	5826746	and then there is a leaked trailer that if it's to be believed then Resident Evil 6 will come out on October 2nd I'm sure there's a few people who are still into that series a few
5827805	5829966	Resident Evil 6 looks hot.
5830206	5831887	A lot of people are very excited about it.
5832247	5834168	It's not a side story, which is a good thing.
5834649	5838451	According to this trailer, the protagonist is Wesker's son.
5839371	5840892	The man who's told to save the world.
5842453	5847596	And then, last but not least, Brink has sold more than 2.5 million copies worldwide.
5848236	5849036	That's pretty cool.
5851338	5852058	Good job, Brink.
5852737	5854738	Yay, Brink!
5855579	5859120	Honestly, that's a lot better than I thought that game did because I thought that game tanked.
5859841	5863022	But that warrants a sequel, I would say.
5863663	5864263	That's very true.
5865143	5866664	I hope they're smart enough not to do one.
5868425	5875812	All right, well, since tonight was supposed to be kind of a special show at All Games Radio, although the server issues are holding us back, we're still going on Ustream.
5875832	5877133	Well, it's a different type of special now.
5877153	5878514	It's a different type of special.
5878594	5879555	It's fooper now.
5879595	5880095	That's right.
5880115	5880836	Fooper, fooper.
5881697	5887302	So we thought we would do, instead of the foogle question of the week, we would do Ask Orange Lounge tonight.
5887322	5889804	We don't do this segment very often, but it's when we open it up.
5889824	5892146	It is the show where every gamer has a voice.
5892246	5893747	You want to ask us anything, especially...
5894789	5897794	with what's going on tonight, you can send a private message.
5898015	5899798	You want to ask us about life or anything?
5901862	5904306	All right, you can send that over private message to Sky.
5904346	5905388	So let's cue up the music.
5910307	5913288	Let's Ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
5913748	5916989	What will we find out tonight on Orange Lounge Radio?
5917750	5921791	One thing I'd like to know is why can't we stream on all games anymore?
5921811	5925532	It was supposed to be a special show, but leave it to us to get fucked.
5929854	5930694	First question tonight.
5932998	5934339	Loco Poco, I love that name.
5935219	5936540	Reminds me of like Poco Roco.
5937080	5941743	Loco Poco wants to know, if RuPaul's Drag Race was a fighting game, thank God for serious questions.
5941823	5943744	Thank God for serious questions.
5944485	5951489	If RuPaul's Drag Race was a fighting game, how bad would RuPaul be as a final boss if he had SNK boss syndrome?
5952864	5953784	Well, you know what's funny?
5953964	5957025	I don't know if you've seen the video for Glamazon, but it's on the internet.
5957045	5959366	You know, the big video that features the three finalists?
5959826	5962527	It has, like, a video game theme, funny enough.
5962607	5968089	And it's, you know, the three queens that beat all the other ones, like, being big Glamazon robots stepping up.
5968109	5973711	But there's a lot of, like, video game graphics in it and stuff, so it was clearly inspired by games.
5973891	5974872	You want to know something funny?
5975652	5986778	Like, in the early 90s, my friend had an avatar online called Glamazon who was a large, buxom, overweight Wonder Woman.
5988399	5991020	So, how bad would RuPaul be as a final boss?
5993822	6005429	you would sashay all over your face but seriously what would a dream fighting game crossover that has yet to be done be a dream fighting game crossover that hasn't happened yet
6006508	6013052	I don't know about fighting game, but I do know what I would like as a survival horror game.
6013452	6014393	I'd like a supernatural game.
6015694	6017635	I just want a new goddamn Killer Instinct game.
6017675	6018535	Is that too much to ask?
6019156	6021377	We'll say Killer Instinct versus Mortal Kombat.
6021777	6022618	That works in my head.
6022638	6023618	That would be pretty epic.
6023958	6025199	I'm going to say that for my answer.
6025599	6033044	I want Pretty Fighter versus Asuka 120%, who only Sega, Saturn fighting game people know what I'm talking about.
6034345	6037206	Tiger Claw thinks RuPaul's Drag Race would be more of a kart racing game.
6037826	6040466	Geovidea says RuPaul would be a fierce final boss.
6040586	6041207	Fierce, fierce.
6042107	6044447	All right, moving on to a question from Actdeft.
6045507	6047008	Here we go with a serious question, guys.
6047048	6047328	All right.
6047848	6053229	What's the thing or are the things you have regretted doing in the show and why?
6053989	6056970	Anything you think or know you did wrong or shouldn't have done at all?
6059833	6060994	Regret's a strong word.
6061634	6062595	I think I know what Loki's is.
6062655	6062955	Go ahead.
6063235	6063816	Karaoke.
6069125	6070446	I'm sure there's things I've said.
6070466	6074348	In fact, I know there's things I've said where I've kind of gone back and changed my mind later on.
6074388	6076809	And I think, boy, I sounded kind of stupid and ignorant saying that.
6077529	6079590	My opinion on some games ends up changing.
6079670	6082132	But that's part of this process.
6082172	6090616	And that's kind of the risk that we take doing this show every week and having done it for so long is that sometimes we're going to grow up in front of you.
6091056	6093217	And in a lot of ways, that's kind of happened.
6093237	6094398	When we started this show...
6095038	6097160	We were 10 years younger than we are now.
6097500	6100001	We went from being in our early 20s to being our early 30s.
6100102	6102263	And I think there's just a lot of like kind of growing up that happens.
6103043	6110188	I'm going to be honest, although I think the old shows for OLR are great, and I'm really proud of a lot that we accomplished in the old shows.
6110689	6116492	When I go back and listen to old episodes, like anything before episode like 150, really, I go back and listen to the old stuff.
6116532	6121916	It's really hard for me to listen to because I'm like, oh God, oh God, there's so much technically wrong with this.
6121976	6124498	And it just sounds like a hot fucking mess everywhere.
6125118	6150901	so I mean I wouldn't call that a regret but it's definitely something we've really like learned a lot uh from so I mean otherwise as far as specific instances I I can't maybe when I had my diva fit I'm not really proud of that moment um that was you know back when the show ironically when the show died halfway through and uh something just set me off and I think it was on Justin TV I don't know the place where we used to stream so I don't know um
6153122	6155544	That wasn't a highlight of my career, certainly.
6156404	6161087	But regret's a strong word because you learn from every little fuck up, you know?
6162848	6163148	All right.
6164148	6170792	Rama asks, what game you played was so bad you said, fuck this shit, dropped the controller, and left?
6173072	6176376	What game was so bad you said, fuck this shit, drop the controller and left?
6177016	6177777	Oh, I'm sorry.
6178258	6178939	You weren't jumping in.
6178999	6182182	I assumed you... What would you like to say for regrets?
6182583	6182903	Nothing.
6185626	6185946	Bitch.
6186106	6186367	All right.
6187836	6189237	I haven't rod rolled you enough.
6191338	6193460	Game where you drop the controller and said, fuck this shit.
6193740	6195181	Fusion Frenzy 2.
6195942	6197463	So fucking terrible.
6197743	6198163	That game.
6198323	6200625	I was like, what the hell is this garbage that I'm playing?
6200805	6202006	Yaris would be a good one.
6203227	6204427	Sonic 4 Episode 1.
6205288	6206149	Sorry to say.
6207450	6207850	Loki?
6208210	6208871	Bullet Witch.
6210091	6210692	Oh, yeah.
6210772	6210932	Oof.
6212933	6225656	and actually Oni Chambara because it was pretty annoying the whole having to have your sword get dirty and get stuck in zombies is stupid a sword would not get stuck in zombies a sword chops zombies in half
6228547	6228867	Let's see.
6228887	6231449	I'm going to try to burn through the rest of these questions here pretty quick.
6231610	6237314	Randy says, Have you guys ever looked through your game collections only to find a sealed game?
6237534	6237894	Oh, God.
6237954	6238535	All the time.
6238695	6239255	All the time.
6239375	6243739	This happened to my cousin and a shrink-wrapped copy of NBA 2K10 yesterday.
6244459	6245160	All right, Randy.
6245520	6245660	No.
6246140	6250764	I found the Blue Seed RPG about a month ago for Saturn.
6251465	6252928	I have a copy right over there.
6253509	6256735	Pilotwings Resort on the 3DS still sitting in the shrink wrap.
6258098	6258839	Stupid me.
6258859	6261424	Might as well sell that stuff for new on eBay.
6261644	6261905	Right.
6263587	6265568	Matt, anything that you've had?
6266568	6274232	I just have copies, but nothing that I didn't know I have because I normally don't leave that stuff shrunk.
6274832	6282415	I have still a shrunk copy of Earth Defense Force, the original one, because I bought five copies of it.
6282755	6286537	Well, actually, I bought three copies when we were selling my work for five bucks each.
6286917	6288158	I'm like, I can't pass that up.
6288418	6290160	I am buying all the copies of those games.
6290920	6291421	So I kept them.
6291461	6294663	And funny enough, I actually broke a couple copies of mine.
6294984	6301169	And it's still worth actually a pretty good amount of money, I think, because it's hard to find now.
6301749	6302550	All right, I'm going to close.
6302570	6306673	Which, by the way, Sandbox Games is working on a new version of Earth Defense Force.
6306693	6309135	Actually, Rob, there is another game that we have that's still shrink-wrapped.
6309155	6309475	What's that?
6309835	6310056	That's...
6313178	6315301	Gunstar Heroes for the Game Gear.
6315501	6315942	Serious.
6316402	6317544	Why when you got the Genesis one?
6317944	6319546	Well, I bought it for Dan as a treat.
6319646	6320287	I'm going to end.
6320467	6322610	No more questions because I got five questions in queue.
6322650	6324232	So question time is up.
6324732	6326394	You need to read my question.
6326414	6327315	I'm not reading your question.
6327335	6328116	My question is great.
6328817	6331220	DarkSakura asks, why are you so fly?
6331560	6333242	Because I'm hot.
6333322	6334804	All right, moving on.
6334944	6344975	GZDR4EV wants to know, according to Wiki, this is a deep question, according to Wiki, 68% of the population believes in some type of religion.
6345716	6348779	So why aren't there more video games with a religious theme?
6350069	6350789	controversy.
6351150	6351850	Hi, people.
6352190	6357853	You get one little thing about someone's religion wrong and they want to just go, it's sacrilegious.
6358234	6359234	I think it is part that.
6359294	6364877	I mean, even though the stat is 68% believe, the problem is that split up into how many different types of religions.
6365437	6368619	So, you know, and like DarkSakura says, you get something wrong.
6369320	6369900	I don't think
6370874	6380460	You may not kind of put the two in the same category, but I think there's a lot of games where spirituality is a theme, especially a lot of modern RPGs.
6380600	6382862	I think especially a lot of the newer Final Fantasy games.
6383522	6386744	Mass Effect, to some extent, has a little bit of those themes in it.
6386824	6394229	I mean, it's not really in your face, but there definitely is questions about the big picture, which is what religion's about.
6394529	6400013	All these different, especially in RPGs, like you were saying, all these different worlds have their own mythologies.
6400663	6405590	You know, for example, I'm just, you know, I'm going to use World of Warcraft.
6405711	6408034	DR4F forgot about Battle of Olympus.
6408595	6410097	He did.
6410237	6413682	But I'm going to use World of Warcraft as an example just because it's fresh in my mind.
6413702	6415004	I just finished that Thrall book today.
6415164	6415645	It was really good.
6416386	6422335	It's got elements of shamanism, which we have in pagan religions today.
6422455	6431328	They have their light, which I'm assuming is... The way they've lined it up is close to an equivalent of Christianity and Judeo-Christian religions.
6432049	6437173	You know, they've got, you know, the devil worshippers.
6437213	6439195	They have all kinds of different cults.
6439875	6443638	You know, but, you know, even apocalyptic cults, which we've got apocalyptic cults here.
6443718	6448682	You know, how many of those people poisoned themselves to get on the giant spaceship on Halley's Comet, you know, whatever.
6448942	6449723	Oh, yeah.
6449803	6450243	No, that wasn't.
6450303	6451024	It was Hail Bop.
6451244	6451584	Hail Bop.
6451604	6452124	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
6452144	6452665	That whole thing.
6453045	6454226	The freaky guy on the TV.
6454506	6454886	Yeah.
6454926	6456067	I blame Oom Bop for that.
6456167	6456488	Shut up.
6457328	6483031	but I mean my point is just using that I mean clearly a lot of the religions in that game are parallels for types of religions you have those archetypes you know and then you've got like say Final Fantasy 7 here's an example you've got the Cetra and their earth religion you know the soul of the planet that type of thing
6484770	6487631	So that's just an example.
6488751	6498994	It's not so much that they're mimicking real religions, it's so much that they've created their own mythology based off of what each culture that's made this game understands of other religions.
6499854	6503815	I mean, the same goes into, you know, different anime, TV shows, you name it.
6504795	6505976	Weiland has an interesting point.
6506016	6507556	Tekken has an angel and a devil in it.
6508978	6510899	Well, that's also supposed to be genetic, too.
6511119	6514361	Xenocore says half the Final Fantasies have that theme, almost anything from Japan.
6514421	6515942	Yeah, like the whole spirituality.
6516382	6517683	And here's another idea.
6517983	6524546	For anyone who was an old Saturn gamer like me, there was Black Matrix that was based off of Hell mythology.
6526047	6526247	So...
6529009	6538038	SSJ100 Matt says if you had the money to buy three arcade machines for yourself what would they be?
6538359	6543264	I thought this question came up last week but it was the show that Jason and Alan were on so let's hear it from you guys.
6543704	6545746	What three arcade machines would you buy?
6546447	6550591	For me, BurgerTime, Magic Sword, Spy Hunter.
6552714	6556356	For me, an Ultra Kade, a Mame, and no.
6557217	6557637	Cheater.
6557917	6558177	No.
6561519	6572566	Since I'm going to lump Pinball into Arcade, I'm going to say that I would get probably a Tekken 5, just because I really liked that game.
6573586	6581831	I would get a Strider, and then I would probably get maybe a Theater of Magic, Pinball, or Black Rose.
6582776	6583137	and DarkSakura.
6595932	6596572	Let's see.
6596772	6600035	Well, this is easy because I already have an arcade machine at home.
6601976	6605819	The three that I can't get right now, we'll do... Let's see.
6606420	6614065	Fourth Mix Plus, a Max 2, and whatever the newest DDR game they have out there.
6614626	6618729	Was it something versus Dance Ice Revolution Second Mix or something?
6619369	6619750	One of those.
6620110	6621111	So three DDR machines.
6621131	6621391	Yeah.
6621531	6623071	You won three DDR machines in your house.
6623091	6623932	Well, they're all different.
6623972	6626592	I mean, you know, Max 2 is pretty awesome in its own right.
6626993	6631934	And, you know, 4th Mix Plus is pretty awesome.
6632054	6636055	And the new game, I haven't played the new DDR game, but that might be pretty cool.
6636555	6638696	Hey, Tiger Call, the ferret is actually at my house.
6639406	6641789	X3 vs. Second Mix, says the chatroom.
6642049	6643691	Yes, X3 vs. Second Mix.
6643931	6644852	That's what I'll be getting.
6644932	6645853	Three questions left.
6646393	6655083	Legend of Zaku says, looking back, if Konami quickly and directly followed up with a successor to DDR Extreme 10 years ago instead of Supernova...
6656192	6662215	Do you think it would have created a different rhythm game community than what it turned out due to ITG taking that place?
6664436	6665716	That's a loaded question.
6665936	6668317	I don't think ITG ever truly took its place.
6668878	6676201	ITG caused controversy and kind of splintered the community into a couple kind of different sects, if you will.
6677222	6678022	I said sects.
6678942	6682804	There was the pro-ITG crowd and the anti-ITG crowd, the DDR loyalists.
6682824	6686425	This is how I feel about it in regards to the ITG thing.
6686885	6693708	It's like, if you were at a restaurant and then a dog took a shit on the sidewalk, would that make a decision about which place you would go to eat?
6694954	6698956	I think what needed to happen is, yes, Konami needed to put something out a lot sooner than they did.
6699636	6704438	Konami failed because Konami of Japan refused to take risks.
6705399	6708360	Jason Enos forced them to take a risk here in America.
6708680	6710041	I shouldn't say force, but you know what I mean.
6710081	6715983	He pestered and pestered and did the professional version of that for years and years until Konami finally released something over here.
6716563	6717524	When he left Konami...
6718837	6747636	and they shut down Konami Hawaii who was doing a great job with the Xbox games when they shut down Konami in the Bay Area where the fans were making steps and you know all that stuff I think it lost a lot too much to recover from so honestly a little weird now seeing like some of these step mania artists and stuff like that or people that would make music for step mania and DWI and stuff like that actually as artists in the game it's a little odd neat but a little odd
6747856	6748797	Two questions left.
6748837	6752619	I do have to give another shout out here because I noticed our Ustream count is increasing.
6752879	6754280	This is not a usual thing for us.
6754821	6756062	We are using this as a backup.
6756182	6760425	Our main feed at All Games Radio, which ironically it was to be our last night on All Games Radio.
6760505	6762006	It died partway through.
6762326	6765008	I am still showing feeding to All Games Radio.
6765308	6766889	So their server's down or something.
6767249	6769691	But anyhow, that's beside the point.
6770091	6783552	you can't shut us up that easy so here we are on Ustream if you want to join us in the chat room chat.orangeloungeradio.com it's a radio show that's why you're looking at my Tron figurine on the camera alright moving on two questions remain Xenocore
6784705	6790609	What game have you resisted playing the most but been the most pleasantly surprised by?
6790949	6795132	Xenocore, you couldn't have given me an easier question because it's going on right now.
6795412	6795932	Mass Effect.
6796533	6799115	I wrote it off originally as, oh, this isn't my type of game.
6799375	6800876	This is like a first-person shooter.
6801176	6807220	I watched a friend play it, and I saw the most boring parts of the game driving the Mako around, and I was like, eh, not the game for me.
6808000	6811163	Finally, Shane basically threatened to kill me if I didn't play it.
6811223	6811783	I'm like, fine.
6811984	6813164	He's very good at bullying me.
6813845	6814946	So I said, fine, I'll play it.
6814966	6816927	Oh, Rob, you should play Mass Effect.
6817007	6817508	Pretty much.
6818068	6818669	Just like that, too.
6818689	6819710	That's my Shane impression.
6819830	6830838	I didn't know, because he'll do that and tell you to do something, but then when he fights with you, when he fights with you, no, Rob, you gotta play the... He'll totally do the little boyfriend.
6830858	6834241	See, I see this, fine, I don't care if you play it or not.
6834361	6834821	Stare.
6837543	6845787	so regardless of you know the catalyst Mass Effect I started playing and I absolutely love it and I think it's a fantastic series Jamie anything for you here?
6845807	6858373	Cave Story oh that's true it was out for years and years and we just kind of go oh little well I had known about Cave Story like forever and I even actually played some of the old version of it when it was you know like a flash download or something
6859213	6867142	or I play different incarnations of Cave Story and then just starting to play it again and Dan though, he was really into it.
6867563	6869625	So he's like, I'm going to play your Cave Story when you're not here.
6870145	6870966	Fine, play it.
6871227	6871847	I'll get the points.
6872708	6873729	Loki, anything you can think of?
6873770	6874971	A series you wrote off originally?
6876371	6901945	Call of Duty Modern Warfare I knew it Honestly, because I played it once I was like, eh, I don't really like this as much as I like the World War 2 ones I'm not going to really play this and then went back and it was awesome so, you know, gung-ho into that I don't know Yeah, that's pretty much it I guess Alright, last question from Derek H
6902898	6909937	Question, when women say the good ones are always taken, does that mean if you're still single you're not a good one?
6912637	6914599	I always heard the good ones are always gay.
6914739	6915960	That's what I always heard.
6917241	6918322	And I'm always like, that's right.
6919543	6924108	I was never really in that opinion, you know, because I was like, fuck, I don't want anybody.
6924508	6927491	And then I met Dan and I was like, well, fine, I guess you'll do.
6928111	6930213	No, my husband is the best.
6930674	6931995	Have you ever caught yourself saying that?
6932095	6933216	I mean, you're the woman on this show.
6933556	6937240	No, honestly, I haven't because I mean, I've never had a trouble getting a date.
6938790	6952187	I don't know why, I guess, you know, because I've always, I mean, I always thought that I was kind of this undateable geek chick, you know, but I've never really had a problem getting, you know, getting anyone to date me, I guess.
6952527	6952828	Yeah.
6952948	6953689	But, what?
6954349	6955551	Can't, never mind.
6956011	6959092	But, I mean, but, you know... Can't say anything inappropriate to that.
6959872	6960112	Stop.
6960192	6964733	No, well, I'm going to go ahead and say this out loud in public.
6964773	6965833	Dan was my first and only.
6966593	6967073	Just saying.
6967874	6970034	You know, not that I haven't made out with a bunch of people, but still.
6971994	6978596	But, you know, Dan happened to be the right person at the right time, and he's always been the right person, so I've never...
6979377	6982382	It's never been a case of why are all the good ones taken.
6982502	6985187	It's been, why do all these guys suck?
6985868	6987251	And oh, someone who doesn't suck.
6988092	6990096	So that's what my experience is.
6991213	6999837	I don't know if you find this to be the case or not, but I think a lot of times when somebody finds the one, you're kind of surprised a little bit at it.
7000097	7004319	Like, you know, I never thought it would be this or whatever.
7004339	7008300	And I think a lot of times women or anybody, I mean, I've heard gay guys that say that too.
7008460	7009721	I mean, it's not just women that say it.
7009761	7011762	I've heard a lot of people say that, that the good ones are always taken.
7012282	7013643	And I think, you know, it just means...
7014983	7030254	my radar isn't pinging off because I'm very tunnel vision to what I'm looking for and I have written all over my notepad what I want my dream boy to be like and everything that's shoved at me in the media I'm very tunnel vision and then it's like oh shit I just fucking fell in love
7031916	7041829	And even though it's not a woman-man situation, Alan I knew for years online never would have thought I'd end up with him, moving in with him and all that stuff.
7041849	7043451	But it just happened.
7043491	7044972	And when it happened, it was kind of one of those things.
7045934	7047215	I knew Dan online for years.
7047436	7047636	Yeah.
7047996	7057583	And this is, you know, when I was in Alabama and had no, I was actually saving up my money to go to Anime Expo, which is the money that I use for my plane ticket to fly out here in the first place.
7058423	7063146	But, I mean, I had known Dan forever online and it just happened.
7063947	7064267	I mean.
7065908	7073994	Techness says, it's because the women who say that are usually dating assholes in our chat room at chat.orangeonradio.com I was always dating nice guys.
7075548	7079453	I had broken up with every guy that I had gone out with because he was too nice
7093909	7101696	I went as someone who would argue with me and not treat me like I was, you know, made of fragile eggshell and porcelain.
7102296	7103377	And Dan doesn't treat me like that.
7103417	7108661	He treats me like I'm an equal and like I'm his partner, not just, you know, his woman.
7108801	7109302	You know what I mean?
7110783	7111003	So.
7111664	7111924	All right.
7112564	7115687	Also, I was going to say, because you're in the friend zone, that's why they say that.
7115707	7117168	That's why you hear that.
7117248	7117989	Oh, the friend zone.
7118229	7121652	Because they can discuss these woman to woman things with you.
7122866	7124114	I will say something else.
7125948	7155253	I have had guys come back and say they were interested and I'll flat out evaluate would I have dated this person and for the most part I can safely say no like I'm not going to name names but there was someone who said he was interested in me until he found out I was married and I just flat out said well not to be a bitch about this but I wouldn't have gone out with you and this is why I wouldn't have gone out with you so if I'm the kind of person that you're looking for this is why I wouldn't have gone out with you you know what I'm saying
7156860	7157401	Yeah, I do.
7158321	7160223	And that's very helpful for those guys.
7162245	7163105	Stop being neurotic.
7163306	7163566	All right.
7165027	7165968	Thank you for the questions, guys.
7166008	7167829	We're going to move on with some video game news.
7168270	7172774	Before we do, I have to notice, one other thing I just noted was still in the shrink wrap, going back to that earlier question.
7172794	7173094	Look at this.
7173434	7177838	I have the PlayStation Vita little ARG cards, the AR play cards.
7178158	7178939	Haven't taken them out.
7179119	7181299	Good, because you haven't figured out that the AR is broken.
7181760	7182280	Is it really?
7182520	7182920	It sucks.
7182940	7184020	Well here, I have a use for them now.
7184320	7187341	I'll put them on the Ustream cam since we suddenly have a video feed tonight.
7187381	7187921	There you go.
7188021	7189141	Good job.
7189301	7190381	Look at the cards.
7190441	7194222	You should put Loki's kind of dried out looking pizza up there next.
7194262	7196283	They're like, it's terrible.
7196323	7201644	I tried playing the soccer game and I spent like 15 minutes trying to get that damn thing to work.
7202504	7202664	No.
7202964	7205644	And I played the fireworks game and I was like, nope, don't care.
7206365	7208045	It's just, it's a waste of time.
7208425	7213250	It's neat, but you know, I need like an actual AR game that doesn't require cards.
7213450	7215332	And that works, you know, that'd be nice if it worked.
7216493	7216913	Just saying.
7218315	7219816	All right, let's move on with some more gaming news.
7219896	7221558	The mailbag coming up shortly here in a moment.
7221738	7222379	First off, Loki.
7222619	7225322	All right, let's talk a little bit about Sony.
7225762	7230787	And I mean, I guess they kind of need to have like a,
7232657	7234318	and their own Smash Bros.
7234358	7234879	type game.
7234899	7235639	Because, hey, why not?
7235679	7236480	Everyone else is doing it.
7236920	7244505	So, yes, there was a rumor, of course, that they were putting out some sort of game that was going to feature all the PlayStation All-Stars and that kind of stuff.
7244865	7249108	Well, now they've actually registered a domain called PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale.
7250048	7252550	And it is looking to be like that game.
7252710	7258493	Something with maybe all their first-party franchise characters from Heavenly Sword to God of War.
7258553	7260775	Although, Heavenly Sword, is anyone really going to remember that game?
7261615	7262195	I do.
7263156	7265597	So they're going to have all these different characters fighting each other.
7266877	7269298	Maybe in some sort of Smash Brothers type way.
7270719	7273020	Originally, I guess it was on the working title, Title Fight.
7273920	7280163	Rumored to be announced actually this week on Spike TV's The Game Trailers TV show.
7281303	7281963	When's that show on?
7282083	7282424	Thursday.
7283704	7308625	so uh i guess we'll find out this week if that's the case most likely probably going to be the case um so neat i guess um i i don't know it's just cool we'll see how this really kind of works well i mean obviously they're gonna kind of take the successful super smash brothers format and put their own spin on it i mean it's
7309896	7313277	Yeah, I don't know if they have quite the recognizable lineup of characters.
7313297	7318799	Well, I don't even think I can really throw that kind of shade at it because, you know, there are some big, big characters there.
7318819	7323180	It's just like I don't see how... I mean, like, there's no... At least it's not a kart racing game.
7323941	7325041	They have a little big planet for that.
7325761	7326421	But here's the thing.
7326461	7328982	Like, Nintendo, you know, Smash Bros.
7329022	7333604	makes sense because there's really no M-rated characters in Nintendo's kind of lineup there.
7333624	7334404	They're all kind of that...
7334924	7335946	Thank you for watching!
7355131	7381561	I think they need to have first off Kevin Butler needs to be a playable character as is also the creepy baby from their commercials needs to be a character as well that would be awesome but yes I wonder if they'll get any crossover things you know kind of like how they finally got like Snake and Smash Brothers and Sonic and some of that you think any of that will happen
7381820	7383281	SSJ100 Matt says, can we kill that Marcus PSP kid?
7383301	7383381	Psst.
7406381	7409584	That would be hilarious, but no, it's probably not going to be the case.
7410104	7412506	Alright, EA story.
7412926	7414767	Very controversial company these days.
7418130	7430139	Eurogamer had a report this week that in the UK, EA person Keith Ramsdale, one of the executives at EA, announced that EA is going to develop an online universe for all its franchises.
7430839	7436361	He didn't say multiplayer necessarily, but a cross-platform major tie-in approach to games.
7437342	7439763	And basically pulling in any gadget you can think of.
7439883	7441503	iPhone, Xbox, whatever.
7441624	7442344	Flipo grenade!
7442604	7447086	Quote, Imagine a player gets up in the morning, plays an online match on his 360 before going to work.
7447666	7450767	On the bus on his way to work, he practices his free kicks on his tablet.
7451368	7453929	At lunch, he looks on the transfer window on his PC.
7454229	7456290	On the way home, he chooses his kit on the smartphone.
7456670	7458791	Here's the thing, when he gets home to play again on his 360 that evening...
7459911	7465136	He finds out his account's been hacked and the people have charged FIFA DLC points to them.
7465417	7465717	All right.
7468800	7471483	All those achievements and upgrade will be alive in his game.
7471783	7472343	Here's the thing.
7472544	7477108	Okay, so as much as EA's talking about this unified network, you know, I kind of thought this was already happening.
7477509	7483194	And EA had a very our way or the highway mentality and that's how they got away with a lot of stuff on the Xbox.
7483614	7483875	I mean...
7485336	7493559	Even the way I bought Mass Effect 2 DLC, you kind of had to go online and tie in the Cerberus account online, and then that opens up the DLC.
7493599	7496760	I thought it was ridiculous, but EA is being very possessive about it.
7496800	7505424	Well, yeah, they want it that way so that you have to buy your fucking online passes for every game because they're like, shit, this offline game, how are we going to sell an online pass for it?
7505584	7509686	Because, yeah, that may have worked once with Kingdoms of Amal or Reckoning, but people are going to start...
7510086	7510867	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7530965	7532887	Ghost Recon Future Soldier, Call of Duty Elite,
7547825	7558187	Honestly, honestly, is it really going to take, what, like five seconds to configure your fucking soccer player or whatever when you get home?
7558727	7572070	I mean, do you really have to bring... Well, of course, I guess if you're this type of guy that brings your fucking tablet and phone to work with you and shit, then I guess you want to get shit done right away, but...
7574065	7574385	I don't know.
7574425	7575485	It's a little excessive.
7576066	7580007	Cool if they're going to do that, but once again, I think it's just to sell those online passes.
7581467	7583308	If it adds value, then neat.
7586789	7588529	I think they've done that also with Need for Speed.
7588889	7591850	They had their auto log or something like that.
7594511	7595611	They're kind of already doing this.
7596963	7598104	That's the way everything's going.
7598124	7601607	They need to have some way to drive people to keep playing their games.
7603148	7603909	I guess.
7604469	7604909	I guess.
7605710	7609613	Alright, so you get to hear the same music, theme music again because it doubles for the mailbag music.
7610234	7618881	Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura dives into the email bag head first and pulls out some emails she thinks she ought to share with the rest of us.
7620897	7624998	Um, now this is from April 12th, so disclaimers and everything, blah blah.
7625819	7633361	Um, I haven't heard a lot about Assassin's Creed on the show, and I was wondering why it isn't a big subject on here.
7633501	7638963	It's a stellar series, and I really think the story is underestimated by its gameplay being the main attraction.
7639083	7639843	What do you guys think?
7640063	7643504	There's another game series that I play, and I'm like, fuck this, I'm not playing this anymore.
7643724	7643944	Really?
7643964	7644465	You didn't like it?
7644645	7645685	I didn't like Assassin's Creed.
7645925	7647887	I've heard a lot of good things about it.
7648208	7656318	It's kind of Mass Effect to me, where I saw it really quickly and I was like, ooh, I'm playing too much WoW right now to get into Assassin's Creed.
7656618	7657980	I have a lot of friends that are really into it.
7658080	7663026	It is on my list to get to at some point, but, you know, we can't play everything.
7663286	7663706	I'm just saying.
7693743	7694183	Next email.
7694464	7695184	Oh, that was from Danny.
7696065	7696565	Next email.
7697425	7698446	Hey guys, Sterlach here.
7698486	7699026	Welcome back.
7699166	7705250	I was listening to some random video game soundtracks the other day and had an interesting thought for a possible topic to talk about.
7705590	7707311	And I'm curious what your answer will be.
7707792	7714256	It seems that sometimes that random game will come along that completely sucks but can defy all logic by having a kickass soundtrack.
7715016	7720763	The two that jumped to my mind right away are Unlimited Saga for PS2 and Spider-Man and the X-Men Arcade's Revenge on the SNES.
7721404	7724087	What games do you think of that will fit this criteria?
7724267	7727030	Obviously opinion-based, but curious what you guys come up with.
7727714	7732698	I don't know why, but my mind goes very, very old school, and one of the first games I think of was Goonies 2.
7734139	7737761	I don't know why, and the NES had a stellar soundtrack for the 8-bit days.
7737982	7738442	Oh, yeah.
7738982	7740263	Actually, Dan really loves that game.
7740744	7742845	Yeah, but the game itself was, eh.
7743145	7749330	I mean, it takes some getting into, but then once you really do get into it, you're like, wow, this game, I don't give this game enough credit.
7749870	7753313	But that was really where the soundtrack was so good, I had to play more of it.
7754235	7759318	Well, I liked, even, I'm not going to say it was a bad game, but it just wasn't that in-depth.
7759378	7759998	It wasn't that hard.
7760038	7764860	Strider 2 had a fantastic soundtrack, but really easy gameplay.
7765341	7767622	But for me, a lot of it was just how awesome the music was.
7767662	7768762	And oh my gosh, Strider, here are you.
7769263	7770123	I got a great answer for this.
7770223	7770483	What?
7770523	7771944	Final Fantasy Mystic Quest.
7772264	7772484	Yeah.
7772844	7774665	It's kind of a crap RPG.
7774685	7775666	I mean, it's all right.
7775706	7776366	It's got a decent story.
7776566	7778407	But the soundtrack was so good.
7778747	7780428	And it wasn't no buimatsu either.
7781089	7782429	People are going to poop on me for this.
7782669	7782889	But?
7782909	7783490	Paperboy.
7783530	7783930	Paperboy.
7785205	7787185	I don't like Paperboy, but I love the music in it.
7789606	7790066	I can see that.
7791306	7792487	I just thought it was funny.
7792607	7793047	I can see that.
7793907	7795127	I really am not any good at Paperboy.
7795147	7796447	Paperboy is a weird-ass game.
7796747	7799808	It is, but I love watching other people play it.
7799848	7801548	That's the thing, but I hate playing it myself.
7804349	7806269	Actdeft in our chatroom says, Sonic games.
7809410	7811230	You know, Sonic Adventure 2 had a good soundtrack.
7811550	7812511	Anything you can think of, Loki?
7812571	7814331	A stall on the Sega Saturn.
7815596	7816858	That's a random pick.
7818019	7819381	I love it.
7819561	7820662	It was a great soundtrack.
7820722	7829032	I actually recorded on my cassette tape because I played the music on the Saturn when I rented the console to play the game.
7829887	7830127	Hell yeah!
7847028	7874305	but Crazy Taxi was kind of a crappy game but it's that song or the combination of Offspring and Bad Religion it just wasn't the same which were two bands I was so into when that game came out I freaking love Bad Religion there was another game that just popped into my head and then it popped out the moment you said Crazy Taxi so you know
7877210	7879272	I would say the PlayStation version of Grandia.
7881133	7884595	I was playing it on the Genesis because the Genesis version is so much better.
7885116	7888318	But I still tried to play it on the PlayStation just so I could hear the good music.
7888538	7889659	Hey, come on over.
7889739	7891740	Have some fun with Crazy Taxi.
7897905	7899486	Let's run over some bitches.
7899646	7902908	Hey, you're driving too fast.
7902928	7903308	Shut up.
7905110	7906210	I know what I'm doing.
7909298	7913019	I mean, that song was already big before Crazy Taxi.
7913059	7914479	I remember that song in high school and stuff.
7914880	7920901	And then when that game came out, that song will forever be associated with Crazy Taxi.
7921621	7922622	Okay, I know another game.
7922842	7927243	Just because I liked the music in it, believe it or not, was that stupid Avatar game.
7930249	7931151	Yeah, you're on your own there.
7931291	7935877	And I was going back and watching the cutscenes from Tron Evolution, and that was good music.
7936538	7937099	I'll give you that.
7937239	7938861	Because, I mean, it was pretty much the Daft Punk stuff.
7939422	7939723	But, yeah.
7940444	7940664	All right.
7941185	7941645	More emails?
7942366	7942607	Yes.
7942887	7943107	Okay.
7944349	7946973	Let me go ahead and close the one from our friend Sterlok.
7948672	7949613	Hi gang!
7950013	7955297	Hope you had an awesome time at Electronica last week.
7955698	7955938	I did.
7956718	7956959	Bitch.
7958320	7959440	Thank you for my Duffy outfit.
7959841	7960221	You're welcome.
7961042	7970369	While you lot were having fun, I didn't get to go, so it was just while Rob was having fun, I was forced to help my parents decide which of my childhood memories I wanted to destroy for all time.
7970429	7970909	Hint none.
7971290	7973451	Good lord, this sounds like a terrible reality show.
7975081	7977903	While sorting through all my stuff, I found my old Master System 2.
7978724	7988150	Maybe because all the episodes of Game Center CX I've been watching, maybe it's the fact that you mentioned Castle of Illusion last time, but I felt like I had to plug it in and get me a fix of retro gaming.
7988811	7993294	I was surprised that it still works perfectly and that I still remembered how to plug it in and tune the TV.
7993834	7996816	Flicking through channels and suddenly I saw the Lo-Fi Sega appear.
7997297	7998738	It's a heartwarming experience.
7998798	8001620	Wait a minute, is Master System 2 what they call the Genesis overseas?
8002529	8004511	I don't know.
8005392	8008336	The Genesis was called the Mega Drive.
8008376	8008817	That's right.
8008857	8009257	That's right.
8009598	8010579	It's like Castle of Illusion.
8010619	8011680	Was that on the Master System?
8012361	8013182	They did it in Brazil.
8014043	8014624	Oh, all right.
8015046	8019950	Anyway, I've never really been one for retro gaming.
8020090	8024054	I got MS2 pretty late and missed the 16-bit era entirely.
8024534	8026716	I never really grew up on video games in that way.
8027056	8034422	But picking a game, blowing into the cartridge, and inserting it while imitating Arino's Game Center CX Ka-chow on was fun.
8034482	8035623	I, of course, never seen that show.
8036324	8039407	The games I used to play were pretty much exactly as I remembered them.
8039607	8041889	Fun, uncomplicated, and pretty tough.
8042749	8044510	They just all seemed charming.
8044851	8048533	The old school graphics, the 8-bit music, all real undeniable charm.
8049093	8053096	The only thing I found surprising was how slow the games felt, Sonic especially.
8053536	8056298	Maybe just a case of badly ported PAL games?
8057199	8068506	Unfortunately, I didn't get to spend too much time playing it, but I'd like to say it's thanks to you guys and GCCX that I really had a renewed interest in the pleasure of retro gaming.
8068586	8071228	Thanks, OLR, and that's from the OLR.
8072677	8072958	P.S.
8073018	8078050	When it comes to retro gaming, do you prefer playing old games on a modern console is better than playing them on their original consoles?
8078411	8078832	P.P.S.
8078872	8079835	Bonus images for you.
8080957	8082261	Oh, this is Piccarino.
8086112	8111709	I like to play retro games on newer consoles just because you know there we go getting it on my new TV and everything it's really hard to hook up an Atari 2600 to a modern HD TV you kind of can't do it without a lot of converters you know I saw his Twitter this week with all the Sonic Chaos R-Type oh I fucking love R-Type good times no I fucking love R-Type you want to talk about good video game music R-Type
8112609	8115811	You need to find the opening music for R-Type for me right now, Rob, or I will cry.
8115911	8123014	You know, I forgot to mention in my games that I played the last two weeks, but I actually played through both Sexy Parodius and Parodius Da.
8123394	8124675	Oh, I love Parodius too.
8126556	8127756	Have you ever played Chatting Parodius?
8128416	8128637	No.
8129797	8130898	You should play Chatting Parodius.
8132518	8132878	Excuse me.
8132979	8134819	This may or may not be the song you were looking for.
8134879	8136060	I don't know this game as well as you do.
8136491	8137133	Nope, that's not.
8137493	8138095	Yep, that's his.
8139778	8141783	Like, bitch, let it start before you make a call.
8148892	8155458	Alright, I gotta watch how much... Here we go, here's the part.
8156699	8159722	This is like my favorite piece of video game music ever.
8160022	8162004	We gotta watch how much of this we play on Ustream.
8162044	8164026	They have a zero tolerance on piracy.
8164106	8164506	Okay.
8164787	8166448	Well, it's on YouTube, so whatever.
8167269	8167349	Um...
8169070	8180937	I would actually have to say, and this is why Dan and I have such a big classic game console collection, is because we really do like playing them on their intended consoles.
8182237	8194464	Sometimes I like going back and playing a few things on a newer console, if that happens to be what I have hooked up, and say that the Neo Geo is at Dan's mom's house, because we have a bunch of our game stuff in storage at her place.
8194904	8198105	Well, I can't very well go grab the Neo Geo and play anything.
8198765	8203887	So I guess I can play King of Fighters on the Dreamcast or something.
8203947	8204727	You know, I'm just saying.
8205567	8206968	So it depends on convenience.
8207008	8209868	But if I've got it there, I will hook up the old stuff and play it.
8210789	8211629	Hell to the fuck yeah.
8213120	8213380	All right.
8213620	8214361	Is that it for the mailbag?
8214381	8215221	No, we have two more.
8215381	8215922	Oh, my God.
8216762	8217302	Hey, OLR.
8217682	8219643	We've been gone for two freaking weeks.
8219684	8220324	I guess that's true.
8221084	8221665	Hey, OLR.
8221705	8222685	Defective Candy here.
8222725	8226847	Just emailing to announce my boyfriend and I are the new proud parents of our own arcade cabinet.
8227668	8229028	I picked it up on Craigslist for $70.
8229189	8233811	It needed a little work, but the wood alone to build one from scratch would have run us over $100.
8233911	8238534	We were thinking of turning it into a main cabinet, a PC-based system that uses emulators.
8238634	8239114	Yes, we know.
8239854	8242036	Just because the game card is shot.
8242516	8246619	The original cabinet was from Datapro, although I am unsure what game originally came with it.
8246679	8248741	It had WWF WrestleFest in it.
8249201	8249761	I remember that game.
8250302	8255326	I found out Datapro was a large manufacturer of mostly pinball machines and I was wondering if DarkSakura was familiar with the brand.
8255726	8258768	I am familiar with them, but I don't think that they put out much that was good.
8258868	8259729	I can double check that.
8260589	8263852	I know it was Gottlieb that put out that TMNT table.
8264412	8265012	I'll have to check.
8266533	8271854	Anyway, I wanted to thank you guys for keeping me in the gaming world all these years and inspiring me to follow my dreams of buying my own cabinet.
8272434	8276495	I think the bug has really bitten us and we already went out to make a bar top cabinet next.
8276735	8278856	Keep you updated on the status of our work.
8278936	8279936	Cheers, Defective Candy.
8280236	8281356	I want a bar top cabinet.
8281776	8283277	They're more expensive than you think.
8283377	8284337	Here's the machine.
8286614	8288055	WWF WrestleFest.
8288095	8289536	What a cheap piece of crap.
8289916	8292037	But it's your piece of crap, and congratulations.
8292197	8292637	That's great.
8292677	8293318	And you know what?
8293338	8296980	That'll be great for the meme, exactly what Defective Candy's talking about in the email.
8297260	8298000	It'll be a great thing.
8298280	8300321	We built ours out of an old stand-up pole position.
8300862	8301342	Our last one.
8302321	8310088	Just be careful with what you're building your system out of because you need to have the right graphics card for it.
8310208	8314853	I think there's... You can find the specs online.
8314873	8316534	Well, yeah, you can get special drivers.
8316594	8317215	Like, I have...
8320402	8329085	I ended up, before I was using an arcade VGA card, I recommend not going through that route because the arcade VGA cards are usually a little bit old.
8329385	8331146	Although the newer ones are newer models.
8331226	8342470	But I ended up going with an ATI card and then they have special drivers that you can get that will do the low res scaling for you.
8342530	8343270	And then also...
8345231	8350134	You want to get the JAMA adapter for the J-Pack.
8350474	8351335	J-Packs are awesome.
8351355	8352035	You need to get that.
8353096	8358239	Also be careful that you buy good buttons that won't wear out quickly.
8359500	8361241	For a cabinet like that, you don't need good buttons.
8361561	8362422	It doesn't matter.
8362442	8363923	The buttons are so damn cheap.
8363943	8365083	They're like 50 cents.
8368928	8369909	The last email.
8371249	8373350	Have any of you played Pure Solar?
8373930	8377312	It's an RPG created for the Sega Genesis but was originally released in 2008.
8377672	8383174	A reprint of the game recently sold out and they will probably release it again at some point.
8383675	8388017	It's a really well made game and does something no other Genesis game has done before that I know of.
8388497	8395400	If you purchase the companion CD soundtrack you can play the Genesis cart using the CD soundtrack in the Sega CD drive for the in-game music.
8395980	8402665	The developer of Watermelon Games is currently working on a new Genesis Mega Drive game, so check out their website if you are interested.
8402805	8405847	Do you have any Genesis RPG recommendations?
8412529	8415351	Any of the fantasy stars really, although that's kind of an obvious answer.
8415932	8418113	I don't remember this one.
8418193	8422076	I remember some of the Genesis games that came out later.
8422477	8425639	Bobby had had one of the folks on his show a few years ago.
8427480	8428561	I don't remember that one though.
8429162	8433805	It's awesome that people are still making games though for Genesis, but they still do it for like Atari 2600 and all that.
8435066	8435966	Genesis RPGs.
8436146	8437567	I didn't own a Genesis growing up.
8437627	8438647	There's a website for it.
8438967	8441868	This is a really hard question for me because I didn't own a Genesis growing up.
8443508	8448810	And my friends, you know, the games we would play would be Mortal Kombat because I had the Blood and Street Fighter Championship Edition.
8449310	8452090	We're all playing games on Genesis that weren't Phantasy Star.
8454531	8455131	Dark Sakura?
8456552	8458572	You know, I was a SNES person growing up.
8458652	8458972	Thank you.
8459012	8459672	Bobby reminded me.
8459692	8460733	It was called Beggar Prince.
8460893	8461273	Thank you.
8461353	8461593	I knew.
8461613	8462133	I was like.
8463310	8481507	I grew up playing Chrono Trigger in the Final Fantasies so but I mean I've gone back we picked up the Sega Ages 2500 a copy of a Phantasy Star which we had our friend Krista translate for us while we were playing through it so I mean
8483607	8484588	I didn't have a Genesis.
8484608	8486029	Not until long after Genesis was done.
8486049	8486129	Yeah.
8506650	8515076	and even then it was just Sonic and Vector Man and... Vector Man's pretty awesome.
8515096	8517198	I don't even remember what else we had.
8520160	8520961	Was that a big booger?
8521846	8522547	It's a chisel.
8522987	8523107	Oh.
8524388	8525148	I'm trying to entertain.
8525408	8531112	Since we're forced to use a, well, we're not really forced to use a webcam on Ustream, but, you know, it's weird to not have one.
8531472	8534054	I've just been putting random objects in front of the camera because we're shy.
8534154	8534935	It's a radio show.
8535135	8536616	Well, I didn't do my hair.
8536956	8537596	One more paragraph.
8538077	8538317	All right.
8538997	8540538	Good luck with the move to a new station.
8540578	8542519	Your fans will follow you, so don't worry about that.
8542939	8547822	Looking on the bright side, it sounds like Bobby will update his podcast feed, which hasn't been done in a couple of years.
8548002	8551684	Yes, this is a great opportunity for Bobby to turn over a new leaf.
8551864	8552104	Yes.
8552244	8553445	And that's by Will.
8553965	8556427	He sent a link, which I'm going to post in the chat room.
8557027	8558408	He must have just written that in the past hour.
8559266	8563608	Yeah, it was there as of part A. Oh, there you go.
8563648	8566249	But it's a link to Pure Solar.
8566269	8567269	Awesome.
8567289	8569110	So I might have to give this a try.
8569190	8570970	Is that a pelican?
8570990	8571831	It looks like a pelican.
8573331	8573991	All right, guys.
8574211	8575052	Let's move on.
8575212	8580774	Oh, Mailbag, of course, at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the website if you want to send us your question for next week.
8580914	8582194	We had a lot of questions tonight.
8582854	8584655	Now it's not time for questions.
8584695	8586716	It's time for angst and destruction.
8604805	8624661	FUs of the week, DarkSakura FU to being tired and having people not really understand the way that good design works Committees, just committees, they should just let me do everything and take it Also one on behalf of Becky, because I'm pissed off for her
8626002	8631827	Um, fuck those little things that try to put you into a category and then hurt teacher for making her write about it.
8632468	8634229	Because I'm pissed off that she has to do it.
8634649	8637992	I've come up with interesting titles for her papers, including Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans.
8640655	8645639	And my suggestion to her for the summary of her essay is, in summary, fuck you.
8645659	8647080	Just saying.
8649242	8649422	Loki?
8649442	8649522	Loki?
8649858	8665011	Thank you to myself for letting my backyard get so overgrown that I can only, not even really mow, I'd say hack through with a mower, a weed whacker, and various other tools.
8665552	8673118	I can only get about most of my side yard done before I filled up two trash cans full of grass and vines.
8673999	8674900	It is a jungle out there.
8677492	8680873	I'm going to give an FU to the fact that here we are trying to do our last show on all games.
8681093	8683433	There isn't an all-game server tonight, but whatever.
8683554	8684214	These things happen.
8684774	8687694	It just always seems to happen at key times.
8688635	8691115	But I will say a thank you.
8691655	8698817	For the listener that says we don't do enough thank yous during the FUs, I'm going to say a thank you to all of the folks, live listeners, listeners.
8699697	8704198	for being really understanding in light of the difficult announcement we made tonight.
8704318	8707019	I feel a lot of love and a lot of support.
8707439	8708839	And that wasn't an easy thing.
8710119	8714040	We've had to keep it under our wraps for a long time, and there's a sense of guilt that comes with that.
8715900	8717041	But thank you guys for understanding.
8717301	8718661	It's awesome.
8718721	8719401	You guys are great.
8719941	8723502	And next week, hopefully, our new server won't go down.
8724582	8724943	We'll see.
8725524	8726906	Anyway, that's it for FUZE.
8727506	8731893	Let's get into a few more stories and then Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR.
8732734	8733475	Just a few of those.
8733655	8734136	Sky Flying.
8734156	8735378	We've got to do Sky Flying as well.
8736099	8740185	So let's try to run through these last few stories so we have time for a couple Skype calls because I know people want to get in tonight.
8741184	8747246	Okay, so Nintendo has made a patent for game emulation on low-capacity systems.
8747787	8758951	Basically, some sort of device that they have, it looks like in an airplane or something like that, where somebody is playing some sort of game or something on the back of a chair.
8759131	8768515	So basically, like an arm device or something like that, that would emulate Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance games, systems like cell phones and stuff like that.
8768855	8775138	Funny, because that already exists, you know, as emulators on, said, pretty much every platform known man.
8775418	8779459	But now they're making it official, I guess, that they're going to do some sort of emulators.
8781100	8786202	Which points more towards, you know, having some sort of software that runs on those, you know.
8786602	8788563	Buy all the old shit all over again.
8788583	8789264	Of course.
8789744	8790124	Played in...
8792003	8802114	I like how you can play them on the back of airplane seats or on my phone that I have or my game device or my tablet or whatever else because they have emulators for everything.
8803656	8804116	Computer.
8806075	8832781	LOL lawsuits Ubisoft and game trailers were sued this week over Assassin's Creed for that email earlier and Assassin's Creed copyright apparently Assassin's Creed stole core ideas from John Besswinger's novel Link Link was published in 2002 Assassin's Creed first came out in 2007 now yes that's right I said he's suing Ubisoft and game trailers
8833789	8834891	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8845180	8851586	His novel discusses assassinations and has spiritual and biblical tones similar to those in Assassin's Creed.
8851966	8856610	There's also a battle between good and evil that was stolen right out of Link.
8856630	8858132	Yours and every other book.
8859613	8870683	Apparently the Link device is where users access ancestral memories and relive specific moments in history much as the Animus in Assassin's Creed does.
8871744	8873245	I've never heard that plot device ever before.
8873265	8876746	I came out with a book with fantasy characters and there's elves in it.
8876947	8877727	I want my money.
8879908	8880548	But this is great.
8880928	8882269	The estate of Tolkien will sue you.
8882289	8889032	The guy is suing game trailers because of the trailers that infringe on the copyright.
8889853	8894455	So just for hosting the trailer to Ubisoft's game, game trailers has been looped in.
8894515	8898597	And that's where this thing went from okay, well maybe, to fucking absurd.
8900273	8900513	DarkSakura
8925339	8930602	Well, there is going to be Silent Hill Revelation 3D.
8930802	8931242	Yay!
8931362	8932743	And it's going to be in the theaters.
8932863	8933444	Yay!
8934344	8936845	October 26th, which is my brother's birthday.
8937026	8937566	Just saying.
8939107	8941248	I am so excited.
8942529	8945970	But it will have Sean Bean and Carrie Ann Moss.
8947011	8949532	And it will sort of follow Silent Hill 3.
8950573	8954075	Just that it's got Heather Mason in it and their stuff.
8954375	8956816	I find it fascinating it's most of the same cast from the first movie.
8956836	8958797	That's great that they were able to get them all to come back.
8959217	8959998	Yeah, I think that's cool.
8960058	8961058	Will Sean Bean die?
8961078	8961838	Because he dies in everything.
8961858	8963759	I was just going to say that.
8963879	8964380	Oh, sorry.
8966701	8967201	Don't sue me.
8967461	8970762	But apparently it's going to have Akira Yamaoka's music again.
8972183	8974144	And I'm excited.
8974364	8975805	I am super, super excited.
8975865	8983128	But it doesn't say who... It means I'm going to have to go on the wiki now to see who actually directed it because I don't think it's Gans this time.
8986531	9012920	DJ Morpheus in the chat room Anne Rice came up with overly gay vampires first but no suit against Twilight okay I'm on I should be offended but I'm totally not that's great okay I'm on the IMDB and it said no it won't load okay does this mean does this mean OLR field trip to the movies OLR night at the movies movie date Michael J Bassett will DarkSakura and I share a popcorn I don't need popcorn
9013960	9014860	Allergy to corn.
9016341	9017961	Will Loki and I share popcorn?
9018041	9018882	You and I, we can share.
9018942	9019982	No, I'm not sharing.
9020542	9020762	Rob.
9020962	9021663	Share.
9022223	9022983	Rob, Junior Mints.
9023243	9024384	All right, we'll share Junior Mints.
9024404	9025144	We'll show Junior Mints.
9025684	9029205	I just want an excuse to put my hand in the box at the same time we hold hands.
9030306	9030846	Aw.
9030886	9033607	But it's directed and written by Michael J. Bassett.
9033727	9037508	And another person, this is Kit Harrington, who I have no idea who that is.
9038648	9042250	Some dude whose mom's name is Debra.
9044203	9047319	Oh, he's in Game of Thrones, no wonder, because I don't watch that stupid show
9049000	9050221	I'm not going to go into it.
9050661	9053363	I happen to know a lot of people really love that show.
9053383	9053823	I haven't watched it.
9053863	9056424	I'm going to say what I've told lots of people.
9057305	9058886	I don't give a shit if you like it.
9059586	9061107	Don't tell me how good it is.
9061347	9062087	I don't care.
9063208	9065029	It's a really good series.
9065709	9066149	Fuck off.
9066389	9067130	Dan likes it.
9067550	9069591	And this is what I have to say.
9070071	9074534	Just because I don't like something that you like doesn't mean I'm making a statement about you.
9074614	9075594	Don't take it personally.
9075714	9077095	Or that it's bad necessarily.
9077816	9101919	yeah it's just not something I'm into and it has nothing to do with my opinion of you if I know that you like it then I will be quiet and not you know shit talk it in front of you out of respect for my friendship with you but if I don't like it I'm not gonna hide that I don't like it a lot of people might think supernatural is the dumbest thing on TV and they're entitled to that don't tell me I don't care all right moving on
9103802	9107606	You know how it is when you say, oh, I kind of don't like this, and everyone jumps on you.
9107666	9108366	Why don't you like it?
9108406	9109948	It's the best thing ever.
9110408	9111649	I'm offended that you don't like it.
9111969	9114531	That's how I feel when people tell me they don't like RuPaul's Drag Race.
9114631	9120596	It's like, okay, hate on Ru all you want because Fifi O'Hara's in the final three, but seriously, it's the best fucking show on TV.
9120877	9121197	Shut up.
9122480	9123221	But you know what I mean.
9123982	9128145	When people take their shit personally and it's not something they say personally.
9129987	9131808	Black Wolf says, I take it personally.
9131908	9134410	Legend of Zaku says, King Joffrey will have Jaime's head.
9137333	9139695	What, after he gets stabbed sitting on his chair of swords?
9140515	9141056	I don't know.
9141116	9141516	I don't care.
9141776	9143898	That's what I call it behind everyone's back is chair of swords.
9143918	9144759	Right.
9144779	9144959	Right.
9145319	9146300	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9170499	9182566	It is featuring bikini model Yuki Kamamura and well, you have to roll over her breasts that protrude all over the place on the map.
9183206	9186248	Yes, it's like those wonderful mouse pads that you can buy.
9186788	9191231	You must navigate your monkey ball over a field of breasts.
9192752	9193292	Well played.
9195053	9195493	Well played.
9197815	9198255	Boobies!
9201380	9204641	I just worry this is going to start a new fetish of some type, and I worry.
9204921	9205861	I worry for the future.
9206501	9207321	I think it's awesome.
9207541	9213202	Well, actually, if you remember, Super Monkey Ball was supposed to have it where you can actually create maps based off a picture.
9213282	9218043	So if you took a picture of a banana, it would create a banana-shaped map.
9218523	9220944	So what is the TTP for that game?
9221844	9223724	How long before we have penis-shaped maps?
9225505	9226205	Half a second?
9226865	9227485	Two seconds?
9227505	9227565	Yes.
9231222	9245528	um a millisecond a millisecond all right instance or instantaneous one Toa Gak in the chat room says so you move your balls over the boobs yes just like that
9247188	9248549	All right, one more story for you guys.
9248609	9255753	And guys, we have to end on a good note tonight because this is like the hero of the gaming industry this week.
9255793	9256513	And we have to end.
9256793	9258354	We talk a lot of shit.
9258374	9261916	We commentate a lot on this and sometimes have a very cynical attitude.
9261936	9265258	But this guy deserves a fucking round of applause.
9265818	9268640	And we're going to end by tipping our hats to this man tonight.
9269120	9269601	Who is it?
9270521	9273389	Katsuhiro Harada Do you know that name?
9274311	9278883	You would if you're a fan of Tekken He's the Tekken series producer Totally love
9280154	9281715	And why is he our hero this week?
9281976	9283317	Because he's a pimp.
9283917	9287961	He talked to Edge Online, who apparently has been getting a lot of people this week in interviews.
9288361	9295267	And he says, well, he didn't say if you are worried about what Capcom's doing, then don't worry about this.
9295348	9302314	But he did basically say no tech and game will ever have DLC characters at all.
9309824	9310584	I tip my hat.
9312505	9314866	No Tekken game will ever have DLC characters at all.
9315426	9317827	Too bad Tekken 6 was shit, but we forgive you.
9318727	9322369	We forgive you and stand by your amazing statement.
9323969	9331460	Now, before you get too excited, he did say vanity items might be added to the game after the fact and would have a charge.
9331480	9335325	Like, you know, alternate costumes and pre-order bonuses for that.
9335565	9338750	But no DLC characters, which is good enough for me.
9339269	9342331	If people want to play Barbie with their characters and that costs money, then fine.
9342351	9344172	But no DLC characters.
9344232	9344672	Thank you.
9345132	9345533	You know what?
9345553	9347154	Now make sure Tekken 7 is a good game.
9347334	9347974	You know what's funny?
9348675	9350376	You talking about playing Barbies with the characters?
9350816	9353217	Dan was really into Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball.
9354058	9355679	And he'd be like, look at this outfit!
9355699	9357360	And I'm like, oh, you're being such a girl.
9358120	9358580	I love it.
9358700	9359121	I love it.
9359161	9361802	I don't think that's what he was referring to as far as look at this outfit.
9361822	9364344	It's more like, look at how small this outfit is.
9366391	9370381	It would just be funny to think about how he got these different outfits.
9370501	9371103	And I was like, oh.
9372563	9374084	Skype line's open!
9374104	9377366	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9377727	9378267	Give us a call.
9378287	9379788	We got time for a couple quick calls tonight.
9379808	9383591	We're running a little long due to the earlier announcement that caused Bobby to run long.
9384111	9386653	But we will try to squeeze in a few calls here.
9386793	9390415	Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9390916	9392697	In the meantime, let me try to get to some tweets.
9392757	9398461	I don't have a whole lot of time, but I'm going to get to these as fast as I can here.
9399061	9399121	Um...
9400502	9402983	DarkTetsuya wants to remind everybody about The Hunt.
9404543	9407564	Thank you, DarkTetsuya, for putting that on at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
9407664	9415326	I apologize that things have been kind of going to the back burner in spite of everything else going on with the announcements and things like that.
9415606	9418047	But if you haven't checked it out, it's a fun little competition.
9418127	9420947	DarkTetsuya is trying to get the little scoreboard and get people into it.
9421007	9421607	It's really cute.
9421948	9423468	Check that out at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
9424148	9426389	Piece of advice, don't get eaten by a Gru.
9426469	9429129	So you can guess where the next challenge is probably going.
9429669	9431010	In the meantime, let's go to some calls.
9431090	9432050	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9432070	9432410	Who's this?
9433070	9434310	Hey, hey, hey, it's Ranma.
9434350	9435411	Hey, hey, hey, what's up?
9436311	9437031	Not a lot.
9437411	9442232	A couple things I wanted to discuss in regards to PAX East because I didn't get a chance to last time.
9442352	9442572	Yeah.
9443273	9445593	But before that, I just have one thing to say to you, Rob.
9445713	9445893	Yep.
9448014	9449294	In the time I've listened to the show,
9450399	9451639	You've worked your ass off.
9452040	9454260	You've delivered so much.
9454940	9457821	So I don't care what you say.
9458862	9461042	You earned that diva fit you made.
9461943	9462863	You earned that.
9464964	9471946	I mean, for what you give back and for that one person to say something for you to fly off the handle like that, you earned it.
9473540	9475341	This is four-year-old news, Ranma.
9475381	9477023	This is... We're over.
9477624	9481687	That'll probably... You know what's funny in light of all the news tonight about All Games and everything?
9481747	9486572	That'll probably end up being the big highlight of OLR on the All Games Network.
9487372	9490815	And between me and Misty, one of us has that episode on our hard drives.
9490855	9491376	Oh, great.
9492737	9495458	Misty's getting a present when she comes out here for the 10-year show, by the way.
9495998	9496498	Oh, wow.
9496638	9497779	Shit, was I supposed to say that on air?
9497879	9498559	Well, oops, I did.
9500059	9501360	I found some old episodes.
9503040	9504241	So, all right.
9505161	9509122	Anyhow, what did you really want to tell us tonight, Ranma, about PAX East?
9509142	9510122	Just a couple of quick things.
9510322	9515704	One thing was, you know the portable console lounge?
9516984	9518225	Yeah.
9518425	9521686	And a lounge full of 3DSs, the Vita stands alone.
9522768	9523029	Really?
9523069	9525653	Like nobody brought Vitas or what happened?
9526194	9528719	There was like one or two people with Vitas.
9528779	9534269	It was like for every 10 3DSs you saw, you probably saw maybe one person with a Vita.
9534912	9557664	you know what though it's everybody's trying to street pass and everybody's trying to clear their queue for find me and everything I gotta say I got a shit ton of street passes at Disneyland this week when I was there and um yeah I was able to get all the way to the second to last boss and find me too and let me tell you there's some real bullshit that happens in find me too can I just say who you trying to kid anyway
9560071	9561412	No, no, I agree with you about Finding Me 2.
9561532	9562873	I'm like, who are you trying to kid?
9562973	9564854	I know, it's kind of getting to the point where it's bullshit.
9564934	9569897	But I will say this, I did also finish the Kid Icarus puzzle and the little swap puzzle thing.
9570697	9573899	That's a pretty sweet little 3D image that it's like in motion.
9574879	9575760	I finished that one.
9575780	9581483	I'm still trying to finish up the rest of the puzzles as I continue to street pass every single day to and from work.
9582744	9582884	Mm-hmm.
9584771	9586172	There's actually something I was wondering about.
9586392	9586692	What's that?
9586852	9592096	With the lenticular photos that the 3DS takes, Dan's phone takes lenticular photos as well.
9592796	9596098	I wonder if they would be readable by each other's... You might.
9596198	9597779	See what kind of file format it does.
9597859	9599340	See if you can put it on the web especially.
9599640	9602782	If it can go on the web and then you can see it in the 3DS browser, it might work.
9603242	9603763	It probably would.
9604423	9605284	It just depends on the full frame.
9605304	9605964	It just occurred to me.
9606945	9607525	Play around with that.
9608800	9609700	Well, anything else, Ranma?
9610240	9617862	Well, I was telling Jamie this last night, but as you know, the big thing about PAX is the Omegathon, right?
9618202	9618522	Oh, yeah.
9619302	9630925	Well, I am proud to say that one of my very good friends, Tina Lam, if I'm not mistaken, first female gamer to make it to the finals of the Omegathon.
9631145	9631585	Good for her.
9631825	9632305	Did she win?
9633415	9635020	No, she came in second place.
9635240	9639794	I had a feeling because you would have said the first female winner of the Omegathon if that was the case.
9640195	9640837	Yeah, that's too bad.
9641904	9645986	Wasn't the last game some type of old school board game with the pucks?
9647386	9648547	That's what I thought I heard somewhere.
9649047	9655390	Yeah, and on the ride back from PAX, my Twitter feed was blowing up because she goes by the name of Pork Bun.
9655430	9657711	So we were like, go team Pork Buns.
9657751	9658771	You can do it, Pork Buns.
9658791	9662933	We were just going nuts, just rooting for her because we want her to win.
9663013	9669436	But since she came in second, from what I was told, her and her partner are coming back next year to compete again.
9671371	9671991	Oh, that's right.
9672011	9673472	The runner-up always gets to compete again.
9673712	9674112	That's right.
9674452	9675212	I've heard that before.
9676873	9677473	Well, good.
9678233	9682474	And I told Jamie last night, I figured she would love to hear an awesome story like that.
9683274	9686315	I totally think that we should interview her.
9686675	9688336	One day, maybe DarkSakura should be in the final.
9688356	9689396	Yeah, we'd love to interview her.
9689436	9689736	Why not?
9689836	9690276	It'd be fun.
9690756	9691576	Well, I'll see what I can do.
9691936	9692597	Yeah, it'd be great.
9693017	9693417	I'd love that.
9693997	9694277	Mm-hmm.
9694955	9695255	All right.
9695675	9698137	Well, Ranma, I've got to let you go because we've got a lot of calls trying to come in.
9698217	9699438	So I'll talk to you later.
9699458	9699798	Okay, buddy?
9700078	9700278	All right.
9700318	9700878	Take care, bro.
9701018	9701679	Stay fabulous.
9702179	9702699	Of course.
9703740	9705201	All right.
9705221	9708202	1-877-GAME-OLR or I use your name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio.
9708583	9710083	Getting you some tweets real quick here.
9710884	9712385	Tiger Claw sends us a couple tweets.
9712565	9715646	Sony wants MMO players to meet each other in real life.
9716207	9716427	What?
9718032	9719493	Final Fantasy XI Fan Appreciation Events
9747469	9750390	I guess that's kind of what you do with like the DS.
9750550	9753131	Go to a Starbucks and get the Nintendo Zone or whatever.
9753151	9753852	It's just like with Nier.
9753952	9755392	That's all they're doing is Nier stuff.
9755652	9756433	Oh, that makes sense.
9756673	9757013	All right.
9757833	9758194	Oh, that is.
9758214	9759774	That is kind of like the same thing as Nier.
9760034	9762776	I wonder if the Vita could facilitate that transfer.
9763396	9764996	Maybe I'm thinking a little highbrow.
9765036	9765517	I don't know.
9767277	9768158	Let's go to another call.
9768905	9769845	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
9769865	9770205	Who's this?
9771006	9772146	It's Legend of Zaku.
9772346	9773266	It's Zaku.
9773646	9775087	I can see Zaku tonight.
9775107	9775887	What is up with this?
9776147	9776487	Hi.
9776607	9779068	Because I'm on my Mac, my monitor died tonight.
9779148	9780849	So, yeah, I have a backup.
9781089	9786310	I would put you on the Ustream if I knew how, but I wasn't prepared to go video tonight, so whatever.
9786630	9787331	What's on your mind, buddy?
9788591	9791652	Nothing much, just like catching up on gaming and the...
9792840	9794902	HBO Go and 360 for non-gaming stuff.
9794942	9797104	But yeah, mostly League of Legends and Battlefield.
9797865	9801588	But yeah, it's been either of those two games.
9802029	9817043	And going on what I've seen in packs, like in the Portable Gaming Lounge, I'm pretty certain, I think Adam was right, well, Ranma was right in the sense that, yeah, there probably was a little bit more of a lopsided towards 3DSs.
9819816	9823362	Don't get me wrong, the beat is pretty good, especially for Lumines.
9823722	9829091	But I would also imagine that not only 3DS would have to...
9829827	9833631	You know, compete against the same space as folks with iPhones that I saw over there.
9833852	9835794	Nier isn't also quite the same thing.
9835994	9838657	Like, Nier isn't the same as that 3DS StreetPass.
9838677	9842682	And I seriously think a lot of those people were just trying to, like, I never get to StreetPass with people.
9842982	9844684	I have never, ever played Find Me.
9844924	9848108	You know, like, because, you know, a lot of people don't take their DSs with them everywhere.
9848148	9850471	But a convention like PAX is a great place to do it.
9850831	9861178	Even then, there were still folks on their iPads playing all the other types of iPad games, not limited to Angry Birds.
9861679	9863840	They were just showing off that they had the fancy new ones.
9864401	9877770	Yeah, they had their iPads or their tablets, but it was pretty much like, obviously the 3DS was the only traditional portable game console that was represented, but everything else was still mobile.
9877830	9879371	I even had the chance to break out my
9880168	9884452	You know, my phone for a bit, but, you know, battery was getting there.
9884512	9893300	But you get the idea that it's not just 3DS anymore when you have, like, when you have mobile, especially... I'm trying to remember.
9893921	9894021	Ah!
9894742	9901048	I think it was... I forgot which one from Nintendo actually said that he actually liked Angry Birds...
9903547	9908089	I do remember reading that same quote, something about, you know, like kind of tipping the hats of the competition.
9908549	9909610	Angry Birds ain't that bad.
9910070	9918374	And yet he goes against the wishes of his boss, who basically chides Angry Birds for basically going after their bread and butter.
9918614	9919655	Yeah, but you know he's played it.
9921058	9935682	Yeah, but I guess Nintendo didn't keep these... I don't know if they're keeping their guys on a PR leash, but that's kind of damaging if the official company line is like, we hate casual gamers.
9936502	9939603	Anything outside of, we hate casual developers.
9939703	9942103	The guys who create Angry Birds or any other...
9944483	9946924	I don't think Nintendo hates casual gamers.
9946964	9949224	Look at what we just talked about tonight.
9949284	9951585	Mario 2, who's that really aimed at?
9951785	9954725	It's a hodgepodge of the casual and the hardcore market.
9954845	9964387	It's like that whole platform where people could just buy a developer license for an iPhone developer account.
9967392	9974497	for $200 and make an app that they sell for $2 a pop and make hundreds of thousands in profits.
9975377	9981181	Meanwhile, folks who are doing the same for 3DS have to go through the licensing fees and they're lucky to break even.
9983103	9994912	I guess my point is that with these platforms that have very little overhead, it's a lot easier to create breakout hits for audiences that Nintendo may or may not pick up due to them not taking that many risks.
9996713	10004139	It goes back to the fact that, I hate to say this, but most of the Japanese developers are not that much of a risk takers.
10004619	10006721	What did we just talk about with Konami?
10007021	10007541	Absolutely.
10008462	10018132	I mean, whereas the Western counterparts, at least they understand that if they don't innovate or they don't take risks, they're pretty much dead in the water.
10018353	10023318	And some have lost big, unfortunately, and that's why we hear about these studio closures and so on.
10023618	10027662	Sako, I've got to let you go so we can get some more calls, but I'm glad you had a good time at PAX East.
10027703	10028543	We'll hopefully see you next year.
10029284	10031065	Definitely Later buddy Bye
10051061	10051621	Oh, thank God.
10051641	10052262	It's Porkchop.
10052282	10052622	How you doing?
10053082	10054002	Hey, Porkchop.
10054022	10054603	What is up?
10054823	10056684	Yeah, I've been trying to get through all night.
10056704	10060626	I lost the shoutcast feed, so I have to switch between Ustream.
10060646	10064928	I'm doing everything on my Android, so it's good to finally actually get through and start talking.
10064948	10068389	Yeah, what happened wasn't ideal, unfortunately, but it is what it is.
10068469	10070230	Yeah, I know.
10070270	10076213	You guys are having the night from hell, and it's supposed to be really nice as you're kind of moving on and that kind of thing, so it's got to be a pain in the ass.
10076721	10077643	Thanks for watching!
10092225	10096289	Our listeners are so awesome that they would just follow us to, oh shit, go to Ustream?
10096349	10096949	Alright, we're there.
10097290	10102935	And look at you, you're juggling your Android and you're trying to go to Ustream back and forth just so you can call.
10103355	10104436	It's great.
10104456	10106017	It's not the case at night, it's the morning.
10106037	10107299	It's like 5 o'clock here.
10107399	10111462	I have a lot to do tomorrow, but I decided to dedicate it at this stage.
10111502	10112804	I really enjoy the station.
10113284	10114225	You guys are dedicated.
10114525	10115186	Yeah, why not?
10115786	10119628	I wish I could tell you that the show was going to be on earlier in the future, but that's not the case.
10119668	10120288	I'm sorry to say.
10120948	10121528	I don't care.
10121548	10122049	I love it.
10122089	10122849	I'll still listen in.
10123009	10128991	And I actually wanted to say that, you know, I was going to ask what was so bad about Tekken 6?
10129391	10131152	I mean, it wasn't all that bad of a game.
10131192	10134473	Apart from the whole it's been chopped and changed a bit.
10134513	10138235	I can understand that you don't have, you know, go get your characters anymore.
10138755	10142658	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10168715	10173717	But we were just kind of playing it going, eh, this game's kind of, we're not, like, we're just not into it.
10173797	10174758	Like, I don't know what it is.
10175058	10176038	Alan, can you explain?
10177059	10180480	Yeah, we did story mode or whatever with a few characters.
10180600	10183962	And it's like, we didn't really recognize the roster.
10184402	10186663	And there were a lot of characters, but no one felt interesting.
10186703	10190405	And we played story mode a few times and beat the end boss.
10190425	10192285	And it's like, this isn't really compelling us.
10193246	10193506	It wasn't.
10193766	10195348	It's kind of, I don't know, average.
10196349	10198331	It's that... Yeah, I can kind of see where you're coming from.
10198371	10202935	I mean, it's more than Soul Calibur, to be honest, because you play that and in a few hours you're done.
10203576	10206218	But, I mean, the Arena mode was very lacking.
10206238	10214927	You just go in the scenario, you play through with these guys, and even though they're already in the fucking other modes, you can just play straight away.
10215487	10219529	It still gives you the option to go get them and then you can play through or you can get the random movie.
10219869	10224071	But again, you can just play a load of matches until you actually get those.
10224571	10228193	Like every 10 matches you got like an ending or a scenario, movie, whatever.
10228653	10237257	I think you make some good points but as a big Tekken fan, I mean graphically it was great and they kind of introduced some weird characters.
10237797	10264545	but I mean I think they did okay with it and Tekken 7 yeah I mean and I'm a fan of Capcom don't get me wrong I like their games a lot of their games but you know let's hope they get better and as for the DLC that's great news as well I will say this I am super curious especially in light of the DLC news you know we did get Street Fighter X Tekken but remember they're supposed to be a Tekken X Street Fighter as a part of this Namco is going to get their chance too so I'm
10265885	10267125	Really freaking curious.
10267486	10275828	Like, I kind of hope that's one of the things that's coming out at E3 this year, you know, to get the first look at is the Tekken Cross Street Fighter.
10275868	10277449	What is the other half going to look like?
10277769	10278929	Because remember... Yeah, I lost.
10279230	10279710	Sorry, go ahead.
10279890	10283851	No, I was just going to say there was always Capcom versus SNK was a huge, huge, huge game.
10284091	10286772	Well, there was also SNK versus Capcom that wasn't bad.
10286832	10290353	It just didn't quite get that same, you know, didn't catch on.
10290413	10291294	I wasn't a big fan.
10291334	10295215	I liked the Capcom SNK games, but the other one, that's 3CKS, wasn't it?
10295815	10297155	Oh yeah, SVC Chaos, that's right.
10297976	10299896	Yeah, that was, I didn't really like the look of it.
10299936	10303477	It looked very, you know, I was kind of like, you know, let's push the envelope a little bit.
10303517	10304818	Yeah, but it didn't look great.
10305158	10307959	I didn't really, you know, fall into that side of it.
10309239	10310839	Again, I had a point to make, I can't remember.
10311680	10317541	Anyway, yeah, well, let's hope that, I mean, I saw the box art for Tekken X Street Fighter, whatever it was.
10318642	10320062	I think it's going to be a pretty cool game.
10320422	10323546	Let's hope they don't fuck up like Capcom did.
10323907	10325008	Leave the shit on the disc.
10325349	10326731	Hackers gonna hack and all that.
10326891	10327712	Yes, sir.
10328152	10331277	Wyland in our chatroom says Tekken X Street Fighter is 10% complete.
10331337	10333479	Wow.
10333600	10337325	By the way, I would like to point out that my personal favorite in the Tekken series was Tekken 3.
10337785	10338825	Me too, absolutely.
10339926	10340606	Absolutely, yeah.
10340626	10346028	Yoshimitsu never looked cooler, so he stuck through there to the next game, Street Fighter X Tekken.
10346048	10347769	I think he looks the same as far as I remember.
10347989	10350270	I used... I'm sorry, go ahead.
10350750	10359454	I used Jin, and they changed his moves as of Tekken 4, which he had, like, my favorite Jun moves, and all the rest were Kazuya moves, and I was in love.
10360014	10361135	But, yeah.
10361235	10362155	I actually like both.
10362235	10366657	I mean, I think it's cool that, you know, because Kazuya was, in quotation marks, dead.
10367237	10392522	you know that they actually stuck Jim in and said okay well here's his illegitimate son or whatever but the whole I hate my dad thing then in Tekken 4 um yeah why not I think I think the karate kind of looks cool when he does it but again you know you don't want too many characters with the same moves you got Heihachi and Kazooie are pretty much the same um yeah so it's fresh it's new it worked I think it worked for me anyway so I mean up to you if you like it or not
10393524	10393804	All right.
10393925	10396628	Well, Porkchop, I got to let you go so we can wrap up the show.
10396928	10398470	But I appreciate you sharing your perspective.
10398650	10402234	There's nothing wrong with a friendly little talk about what games we do and don't like.
10402574	10404636	So, Porkchop, take care, buddy, and thanks again for staying up late.
10404877	10405377	Absolutely.
10405638	10406719	Keep the dream alive, guys.
10406779	10407199	All the best.
10407600	10407980	Take care, buddy.
10408000	10412145	I was going to say that the reason why it's only 10% done is because they're working on Tag 2 right now.
10414484	10415085	Oh, yeah.
10415285	10415686	Oh, yeah.
10415766	10416867	That's supposed to be a big one.
10416887	10419470	Yeah, it's going to come up on multiple consoles this year, isn't it?
10419770	10420130	Yeah.
10420230	10420951	So, all right.
10421932	10422533	Let me burn through.
10422553	10423834	We're going to close the Skype line.
10423894	10425396	I'm sorry to those that didn't get through.
10425796	10426297	Very sorry.
10426597	10429480	Please consider sending us an email, mailbag at orangelawntrader.com.
10429540	10429800	Again...
10430461	10431381	The show isn't ending.
10431822	10433022	It's a very important point.
10433062	10433863	The show isn't ending.
10433943	10437084	So we'll have a show just like always next week, especially podcasties.
10437124	10440366	If you're listening on the podcast feed, you're going to be like, oh, next week?
10440966	10449611	Like, same show, but I'm just hearing some slightly different websites given and some different things that will slowly unravel itself throughout the coming year.
10450291	10453154	Anyway, back to some tweets.
10453234	10458840	Tigerclaw also tweeted us, New Facebook lawsuit highlights trouble with kids and virtual currency.
10459120	10459680	Oh, God.
10460581	10464865	I can only imagine how the kids can just rack up all this money so easily.
10464925	10466227	It's kind of sick.
10467087	10470470	But yeah, another complaint was filed against Facebook with the U.S.
10470510	10471210	District Court.
10471611	10474313	According to this link, the Tiger Claw sent us at Gamasutra.
10475053	10479537	This isn't the only instance of companies getting in trouble over minors purchasing credits for social games.
10480137	10480738	A U.S.
10480778	10488423	District Judge upheld a handful of claims that Apple distributed free iOS apps that trick children into money in-app purchases.
10488703	10488904	Okay.
10491806	10494768	Children are allowed to do Facebook accounts from the age of 13.
10494868	10499751	However, if you're under the age of 18, you're supposed to ask for your parents' permission before buying Facebook credits.
10502393	10504274	I'm surprised it's just not shut off altogether.
10504695	10509838	Considering that you have to put your credit card information in, I believe that if you're 13, you don't have a credit card.
10509878	10511399	How hard is it to open mom's wallet?
10512180	10516983	Well, then that's a problem with fraud, and they should throw that kid in jail.
10517183	10517684	Yeah.
10518224	10519285	Throw the kids in jail.
10520565	10523007	SJ100Matt says, Hey, remember Para Para Paradise?
10523107	10524347	Yeah, fuck yeah, I love that game.
10524888	10529830	Well, a new Para-style arcade machine is coming out soon, and yes, it has Gaga.
10530151	10534193	Oh, because every freaking music game these days has to have Gaga.
10534433	10536314	Don't get me wrong, I love Lady Gaga, but damn.
10536994	10539356	Dance Core is the game, I guess, that's coming out.
10539416	10542277	He links us to a little YouTube of somebody playing it.
10542677	10543198	Yeah!
10543298	10543838	What is it?
10552769	10553470	It just looks like something.
10553490	10553950	K-pop!
10554070	10554991	It's going to be on Kinect.
10555852	10557393	Maybe not in this country, but it'll be Kinect.
10558514	10564278	But they say, yeah, they say in the article it's more closer to Power, Power, Paradise than it is like DDR or Dance Central or anything like that.
10565379	10569562	Or maybe Dance Masters because that kind of had a lot of power in it.
10569582	10569902	But anyway.
10572737	10575278	That's really... I think that's going to do it for tweets tonight.
10575318	10576498	Thank you guys for sending us tweets.
10576518	10577619	Twitter.com slash OLR.
10577919	10579099	But we've got to wrap up the show.
10579139	10582040	We've got to wrap it... Oh, wait.
10582140	10584281	I got one last tweet that came in.
10584921	10587542	Let me read this one from GamerGirl.
10588422	10590603	I have a question regarding GLBT.
10591523	10594624	I know someone who is bi and they want to come out, so to speak.
10595185	10596445	What is the best way to do so?
10597806	10598626	Woo!
10598806	10600466	You turn the knob, open the door.
10600626	10601247	Here we go.
10601947	10602047	Um...
10604153	10631640	I know there's a lot of you know obviously I'm speaking as the gay guy on the show I know there's a lot of society pressures that come with like coming out and all that stuff and sometimes it's one of those things people kind of feel like they kind of have to do to get it off their chest I really truly believe a shirt person should not feel like they're forced to do it until they're ready because taking that first step to really like come out to yourself can be one of the hardest things you have to do in that whole process
10632260	10653119	so, you know, don't ever feel any pressure that you do or you don't have to do anything you know, for your friend, whoever your friend wants to love is their choice whoever your friend wants to have a relationship with is ultimately their choice you know, that's a private matter that is public when you want it to be public, your friend
10653940	10656822	So they want to come out or whatever.
10656862	10658083	What's the best way to do so?
10658203	10660665	You need to tell the people that are closest to you.
10661025	10664848	True friends are not going to turn the other way.
10665749	10670392	Some may kind of say, you know, I'm always kind of suspected, but it doesn't really change anything.
10670592	10674635	I had the really good fortune that when I came out, everybody was supportive.
10674655	10677437	There was very few people that I got into shit with.
10677477	10680680	And anybody that was a problem, ain't in my life anymore.
10680940	10681340	Bye.
10682401	10682721	You know?
10683281	10687423	But there's been a lot of great people that most people I know just don't really care.
10688003	10689523	And I think that's fine.
10689963	10690663	I will say this.
10690683	10696485	Most of my friends that came out and told me, I was usually like, duh.
10697165	10702387	The fact that it's bi and not gay can be a really tricky line to walk as well.
10703447	10724838	and you know that could be a lot you know this could be somebody who's still questioning in a lot of ways and says maybe I'm having these type of tendencies you know or whatever all I'm saying don't ever don't ever feel like whoever you are you have to pigeonhole yourself into one bucket or another or whatever just love somebody
10726099	10743341	and you know my best preferably yourself first yeah oh yeah absolutely starting with yourself accept yourself and everybody else will come easy that's the best advice I can give love yourself first then those closest to you and your true friends will show their colors now can I say the witty thing yes
10744340	10746883	For the ones that come easy, some people are easy.
10747684	10748424	Stop.
10748985	10749245	Stop.
10749526	10749766	All right.
10750747	10751128	That's it.
10751188	10751989	That's it for tweets.
10752049	10754051	That's it for Skype calls.
10754111	10755253	That's it for the show.
10756774	10761981	Thank you guys for staying up late with us on what has been a very interesting episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10762861	10765242	and a new chapter starts next week.
10765922	10768063	And can't wait to tell you all the details a little later.
10769563	10777106	We'll stay tuned to our Twitter feed, twitter.com slash OLR, our Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio, our website, of course, orangelaunchradio.com.
10777466	10781267	All the details in the coming days will be on the website.
10782627	10784308	That's all I have to say for now on that.
10785148	10790811	Anyhow, everything else about the whole situation will be in the podcast feed.
10790851	10796533	We're going to replay the call that happened with Bobby and I think everything else we had to say on it is all contained in there.
10797614	10801275	In the meantime, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
10801755	10802896	Loki, your final thoughts tonight.
10803476	10815705	This is really strange, but there was this kid, because I took Josh to the park today, practicing his unicycle, which begged the question, if a bicycle can be shortened to a bike, would a unicycle be a eunuch?
10819488	10820369	My final thought is...
10827687	10834878	I felt this weekend that I have a lot of drama in my life right now, but I feel really good tonight.
10835459	10837141	And I want to thank all of you for being a part of that.
10837842	10838323	DarkSakura?
10838964	10840847	Because people will shoot me if I don't say it.
10841027	10842109	Reject false icons.
10844223	10845624	Have a wonderful night, everybody.
10845904	10848645	We'll see you next week somewhere.
10849326	10849866	Have a good night.
10850787	10851127	Until then.
10868155	10870057	or allgames.com, but we're probably right anyway.
10870117	10870658	See you next week!
