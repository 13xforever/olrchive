1
00:00:00,249 --> 00:00:03,950
[SPEAKER_08]: You're listening to the podcast Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 454.

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:11,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Before we get to tonight's show, we would like to start with an important announcement that occurred during the taping of the Bobby Blackwolf show the night of the recording.

3
00:00:12,192 --> 00:00:14,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Up first is that clip, courtesy of the Bobby Blackwolf show.

4
00:00:20,855 --> 00:00:23,375
[SPEAKER_10]: But right now, it is 6 p.m.

5
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:24,076
[SPEAKER_10]: on the West Coast, 9 p.m.

6
00:00:25,595 --> 00:00:30,540
[SPEAKER_10]: On the East Coast, and I want to say hello to all the OLR listeners that are coming in for OLR.

7
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,301
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm Bobby Blackwolf.

8
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:34,304
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm typically the opening act here on Sunday nights.

9
00:00:35,345 --> 00:00:40,470
[SPEAKER_10]: We typically don't talk meta that much about where we broadcast all that often.

10
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:48,799
[SPEAKER_10]: We feel that those type of conversations are best kept off the airwaves and in private, but indulge us for a few moments as we discuss some things here.

11
00:00:50,322 --> 00:00:50,923
[SPEAKER_10]: AllGamesRadio.com

12
00:01:07,628 --> 00:01:16,273
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had a lot of great experiences here with this network from E3 Outpost to the Xbox Live Gamer Picks to PAX 08 and E4 All and the live broadcast.

13
00:01:16,373 --> 00:01:21,716
[SPEAKER_10]: Lots of great things have happened that I know I personally will cherish for the rest of my life.

14
00:01:22,636 --> 00:01:29,240
[SPEAKER_10]: And even though I was removed as station manager and site admin several years ago, I've enjoyed the community and the stage that has been here.

15
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,362
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been my home for one hour a week here on Sunday nights.

16
00:01:34,468 --> 00:01:39,512
[SPEAKER_10]: There are changes coming to All Games Radio and they're changes I don't personally endorse.

17
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:45,497
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not necessarily bad, but they're not ones I personally want to be a part of.

18
00:01:46,558 --> 00:01:57,908
[SPEAKER_10]: And one of the other show hosts here on the network stated that if all you wanted to do was just have a stage to do your own show and not attempt to help move forward to make the network a better place, then you needed to get out of the way.

19
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:17,454
[SPEAKER_10]: so even though I don't personally endorse the proposed changes I don't wish to stand in the way of them so tonight right now I'm announcing that this right here is my final broadcast on All Games Radio well

20
00:02:17,992 --> 00:02:21,734
[SPEAKER_08]: This might be a good time to mention that there is a reason we haven't hung up just yet.

21
00:02:22,595 --> 00:02:33,320
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, Orange Launch Radio started as its own fully-fleshed radio station in 2002 on Live 365, and after five years, we made a business decision in light of escalating costs to move to the All Games Network.

22
00:02:34,481 --> 00:02:38,643
[SPEAKER_08]: This arrangement, as Bobby mentioned, it was really initiated and championed for by Bobby.

23
00:02:39,324 --> 00:02:46,207
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been absolutely honored to have Bobby as he puts it in his words as an opening act for the past five years.

24
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:47,148
[SPEAKER_08]: We view it a little differently.

25
00:02:47,828 --> 00:02:52,870
[SPEAKER_08]: But without Bobby's efforts, it's very possible that OLR, as we know it, would have ended several years ago.

26
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,971
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, change to All Games Radio is going to be a great thing for the station.

27
00:02:57,831 --> 00:03:06,754
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's time to let you all know that a plan was drafted some time ago that will require us in order to take Orange Lounge Radio to the next level to leave the network as well.

28
00:03:07,935 --> 00:03:14,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Tonight's upcoming episode, episode number 454, will be the last Orange Lounge Radio on the All Games Network.

29
00:03:16,277 --> 00:03:21,758
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been fierce supporters of independent podcasting and podcasters and this is not and will not change.

30
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:29,380
[SPEAKER_08]: We remain supporters and fans of the All Games Network even though the future for Orange Lounge Radio will involve our show being elsewhere.

31
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:37,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Out of respect to the other hosts and community at All Games Radio we will not be unveiling those plans here on their bandwidth.

32
00:03:37,862 --> 00:03:38,322
[SPEAKER_08]: Stay tuned.

33
00:03:38,342 --> 00:03:39,062
[SPEAKER_08]: You know where to find us.

34
00:03:39,602 --> 00:03:44,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, the show will go on next week and yes, Bobby is still the co-headliner.

35
00:03:47,287 --> 00:03:47,848
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

36
00:04:05,307 --> 00:04:06,007
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for watching!

37
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:52,758
[SPEAKER_10]: the community here at All Games we've had some good days and we've had some bad days people that are probably in the community more often than just Sunday nights know what I'm talking about but ultimately I will remember a lot of the good stuff the hardest part of this is that I will probably be leaving the chat room where I've idled for almost a decade sometime this week and it's going to be kind of hard to say goodbye to that but sometimes it's time to move on Tigerclaw

38
00:04:54,605 --> 00:04:55,965
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys probably don't realize this.

39
00:04:56,845 --> 00:05:02,546
[SPEAKER_10]: If it was not for Tiger Claw, this stage that we have been on probably would have collapsed a year ago.

40
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:09,528
[SPEAKER_10]: He is the man that has been keeping the light on for the rest of us because he's been kind of acting as station manager.

41
00:05:10,128 --> 00:05:15,109
[SPEAKER_10]: He has championed bringing in other people, other podcasts to the community.

42
00:05:16,869 --> 00:05:20,370
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure that he's going to help keep the light on for much, much longer.

43
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:22,650
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much to Tiger Claw for everything.

44
00:05:24,232 --> 00:05:25,913
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, lastly, Scott Rubin.

45
00:05:26,574 --> 00:05:44,328
[SPEAKER_10]: And while Scott and I did not see eye to eye on everything, and I might have actually felt that there were some unfair characterizations made of me back on the All Games Interactive days, off the air, he has been very supportive of me and wanted me to succeed in everything that I wanted to accomplish.

46
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:52,075
[SPEAKER_10]: I am here to do this tonight because of him, because of his advice, because of his support.

47
00:05:52,715 --> 00:05:53,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Without Scott Rubin...

48
00:05:54,284 --> 00:05:58,668
[SPEAKER_10]: There would be no Bobby Blackwolf, literally, as in he actually picked out that name.

49
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:00,570
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't come up with that name, Scott did.

50
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:07,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Just as Scott has moved on from all games, he's doing high-profile live streams for mainstream TV networks.

51
00:06:07,816 --> 00:06:14,843
[SPEAKER_10]: It is time for me to move on from all games, but I thank Scott for every single opportunity that he has given me.

52
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,982
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to thank some people too, but our lists are probably very similar.

53
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:24,804
[SPEAKER_08]: First, Bobby Blackwolf, obviously, for all the obvious things we've already stated.

54
00:06:26,165 --> 00:06:32,869
[SPEAKER_08]: The other hosts at All Games Radio that work their asses off to produce quality content for this network and promote the independent gaming community.

55
00:06:33,429 --> 00:06:37,371
[SPEAKER_08]: I personally have loved meeting all of you at the various events.

56
00:06:37,771 --> 00:06:41,515
[SPEAKER_08]: The Paxes, The E3s, The Outpost, so on.

57
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:48,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, not every show is really in the All Games Network to promote the community, but I'm not going to dwell on that.

58
00:06:48,581 --> 00:06:50,623
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot that are very passionate about it.

59
00:06:51,024 --> 00:06:55,128
[SPEAKER_08]: You've been noticed, you've been appreciated, and I hope we can work with you in the future.

60
00:06:56,289 --> 00:07:02,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Although we don't want to name everyone specifically for fear of leaving someone out, if there's one host we need to tip our hat to besides Bobby...

61
00:07:03,355 --> 00:07:08,199
[SPEAKER_08]: It's our own personal podfather and the man that taught us a lot about internet radio, Travis Donovan.

62
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:14,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Specifically to the OL Army, if you're hearing this, you've stuck by us through every tough decision we've made.

63
00:07:14,665 --> 00:07:18,008
[SPEAKER_08]: You've supported us when we said we are no longer exclusively a Bomani show.

64
00:07:18,408 --> 00:07:26,231
[SPEAKER_08]: You supported our creative decision to end the live afterbirth segment of our show because it just wasn't striking our creative spark anymore.

65
00:07:26,731 --> 00:07:33,854
[SPEAKER_08]: You supported us when we left Live 365 to take our show to the next level and we know you will support us as we leave All Games Radio to take it to Stage 3.

66
00:07:34,694 --> 00:07:38,996
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think this is a good time to reiterate, we will be back next week.

67
00:07:39,736 --> 00:07:49,682
[SPEAKER_08]: and you will be able to listen to us just as easy as you do now but out of respect towards the network we're keeping that under our hat as to exactly how that's going to happen for a few more days.

68
00:07:51,363 --> 00:07:53,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Tigerclaw gets our thanks as well.

69
00:07:54,105 --> 00:07:57,006
[SPEAKER_08]: All games would not be able to function right now without Tigerclaw.

70
00:07:57,306 --> 00:08:01,469
[SPEAKER_08]: He's passionate about this network and every host on this network owes you a lot of thanks.

71
00:08:03,021 --> 00:08:21,389
[SPEAKER_08]: of course Scott Rubin although certainly we've mentioned Bobby a bit in how we ended up at all games Scott was a crucial piece of this as well although we give the mainstream gaming press a lot of shit on this show Scott is someone who lived it left it and built an online network that fit in his independent vision and we all have so much respect for that

72
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:25,150
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I know I've been monopolizing the conversation.

73
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,832
[SPEAKER_08]: This is like the first time in probably five years I've read from a script.

74
00:08:28,352 --> 00:08:33,614
[SPEAKER_08]: But I want to allow DarkSakura and Loki, because their OLR is just as much as me, to say anything they want to say about this as well.

75
00:08:33,894 --> 00:08:36,055
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to thank myself for being awesome.

76
00:08:36,255 --> 00:08:38,817
[SPEAKER_02]: No, really, you said everything that I could say.

77
00:08:39,237 --> 00:08:40,457
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jesus has nothing to do with this.

78
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for letting us know.

79
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:43,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, anything?

80
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:49,158
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will still not be updating the radio app on PSP.

81
00:08:49,178 --> 00:08:52,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, our PSP.com will still stay out of date.

82
00:08:52,544 --> 00:08:54,147
[SPEAKER_08]: Some things shouldn't change.

83
00:08:54,849 --> 00:08:56,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Some things have to stay the same.

84
00:08:56,913 --> 00:08:57,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby, it's all you.

85
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:01,526
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I think that this is the part where I'll be letting you guys go.

86
00:09:01,566 --> 00:09:03,226
[SPEAKER_10]: I had to write my stuff to a script too.

87
00:09:03,326 --> 00:09:06,687
[SPEAKER_10]: So any last words here before I send everybody off?

88
00:09:07,827 --> 00:09:08,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't cry.

89
00:09:08,687 --> 00:09:10,588
[SPEAKER_08]: That goes for you and it goes for the listeners.

90
00:09:11,188 --> 00:09:11,708
[SPEAKER_08]: It ain't over.

91
00:09:12,168 --> 00:09:12,948
[SPEAKER_08]: We still have a show left.

92
00:09:12,968 --> 00:09:13,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Stay tuned.

93
00:09:13,368 --> 00:09:14,729
[SPEAKER_08]: We're still having a show tonight.

94
00:09:16,269 --> 00:09:17,129
[SPEAKER_08]: I know this is shocking.

95
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:24,131
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is how you have to start the future.

96
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:26,332
[SPEAKER_08]: and good luck to everybody.

97
00:09:26,632 --> 00:09:28,854
[SPEAKER_08]: And I really, really wish all games the best of luck.

98
00:09:28,994 --> 00:09:31,616
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you so much for having us for the past five years.

99
00:09:32,317 --> 00:09:32,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Good luck.

100
00:09:33,178 --> 00:09:33,478
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

101
00:09:33,718 --> 00:09:35,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Orange Lounge Radio is up next.

102
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,280
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks so much, guys.

103
00:09:37,761 --> 00:09:38,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

104
00:09:58,424 --> 00:10:10,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight, April 22, 2012, Halo 4 has a release date, Nintendo announces new games for the 3DS, and the upcoming enhanced Baldur's Gate won't be coming out for one particular system.

105
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:19,152
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, Jamie Summers, DarkSakura

106
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:40,969
[SPEAKER_08]: It's always some fad diet with you.

107
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:42,050
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a fad.

108
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:44,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Not fad diet, but it is always some diet.

109
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,410
[SPEAKER_02]: I was really happy as a vegan.

110
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,211
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you're purdy just the way you are.

111
00:10:48,471 --> 00:10:49,651
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not doing this for purdy.

112
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:50,651
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing it for healthy.

113
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:51,371
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, fine.

114
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Also say hello to Tech Master Loki.

115
00:10:54,092 --> 00:10:54,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

116
00:10:54,532 --> 00:10:56,192
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's still on his pizza diet, clearly.

117
00:10:56,752 --> 00:10:57,473
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a diet.

118
00:10:59,013 --> 00:11:01,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, because that implies that I'm eating pizza all the time.

119
00:11:01,353 --> 00:11:02,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Loki, don't worry.

120
00:11:02,193 --> 00:11:03,614
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you're purdy just the way you are.

121
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:04,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Really not.

122
00:11:06,618 --> 00:11:09,280
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so anyhow, we're here.

123
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:09,981
[SPEAKER_08]: We're live.

124
00:11:10,681 --> 00:11:20,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Live, as you'll hear on the podcast, as our live listeners heard for the last time, at All Games Radio, www.allgames.com, right after the Bobby Blackwell Show at 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern.

125
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:26,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Join our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com if you want to chat live with us on this lovely evening.

126
00:11:27,316 --> 00:11:28,116
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the date today?

127
00:11:28,136 --> 00:11:28,617
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know.

128
00:11:28,697 --> 00:11:29,437
[SPEAKER_08]: April 22nd, 2012.

129
00:11:29,477 --> 00:11:31,459
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, because my birthday was last week.

130
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:31,980
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

131
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy darn birthday.

132
00:11:33,202 --> 00:11:37,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Before we get into our gaming weeks, let's talk about we were gone last week.

133
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:37,890
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't have a show.

134
00:11:38,051 --> 00:11:41,136
[SPEAKER_08]: I know this was a whopper of a night to come back to, but hey, it's just how it went down.

135
00:11:42,058 --> 00:11:44,242
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, how was your birthday?

136
00:11:44,262 --> 00:11:44,903
[SPEAKER_08]: What'd you end up doing?

137
00:11:45,242 --> 00:11:47,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not really a whole bunch of stuff.

138
00:11:47,283 --> 00:11:51,544
[SPEAKER_02]: I went to get delicious Indian food with you and Alan and Pinkberry.

139
00:11:52,744 --> 00:11:57,286
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dan took me to Claim Jumper where we split an ID clear for dinner.

140
00:11:58,146 --> 00:11:59,626
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt so sick that night.

141
00:12:00,047 --> 00:12:04,348
[SPEAKER_02]: He got me a really neat art book from 1944 that I've had my eye on.

142
00:12:04,688 --> 00:12:05,449
[SPEAKER_02]: It was neat.

143
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:06,670
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very cool.

144
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,052
[SPEAKER_08]: It was very old museum-y when I saw the pics.

145
00:12:09,072 --> 00:12:16,258
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, on top of that, it was a lot of... Because keep in mind, this particular edition was fresh right after World War II.

146
00:12:16,939 --> 00:12:21,683
[SPEAKER_02]: And it had some of the really cool art movements that had occurred just like 10 years before that.

147
00:12:21,803 --> 00:12:24,866
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me as a designer, it was a real treat.

148
00:12:25,346 --> 00:12:29,010
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you and Alan got me a sailor suit for my Duffy.

149
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,732
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can look at your Duffy bear and say, Hey, Thaler.

150
00:12:32,133 --> 00:12:34,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, I love Duffy, you all know that.

151
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,380
[SPEAKER_02]: You two are the only people who got me presents.

152
00:12:39,821 --> 00:12:40,262
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.

153
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:44,226
[SPEAKER_02]: I have everything else that I pretty much want, so it's all good.

154
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:48,731
[SPEAKER_08]: Plus, once you get to a certain age, it's kind of hard to buy presents anymore.

155
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:49,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Outro Music

156
00:13:07,737 --> 00:13:08,738
[SPEAKER_08]: and video games cost $60.

157
00:13:09,238 --> 00:13:08,738
$60.

158
00:13:09,258 --> 00:13:14,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know that's how much I paid for Killer Instinct on the SNES?

159
00:13:14,802 --> 00:13:18,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I was going to say, I guess to be fair, video games have always been kind of expensive.

160
00:13:18,545 --> 00:13:21,147
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, Street Fighter 2 as a cartridge was, what, $80?

161
00:13:22,107 --> 00:13:25,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasn't it one of those, or Mortal Kombat 2 or one of those?

162
00:13:25,109 --> 00:13:27,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what the most I've ever paid for a video game is?

163
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:28,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I probably do.

164
00:13:29,072 --> 00:13:31,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Was it your Castlevania Symphony of the Night on Saturn?

165
00:13:31,774 --> 00:13:33,235
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I've paid more.

166
00:13:33,795 --> 00:13:34,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

167
00:13:34,216 --> 00:13:35,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, the Saturn one was like $20.

168
00:13:36,237 --> 00:13:37,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Your game with the dish.

169
00:13:37,578 --> 00:13:39,159
[SPEAKER_07]: It would probably be a Neo Geo game.

170
00:13:39,439 --> 00:13:40,639
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a Neo Geo game.

171
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:43,721
[SPEAKER_02]: It was $280 for King of Fighters 2000.

172
00:13:44,181 --> 00:13:46,242
[SPEAKER_02]: But Dan and I thought it was going to be the last one to come out.

173
00:13:46,582 --> 00:13:49,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Little did we know the Summer Showdown 5 would be the last one to come out.

174
00:13:49,423 --> 00:13:52,444
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, we wanted to buy a brand new Neo Geo game just to say we had.

175
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:53,465
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were in a different place then.

176
00:13:54,465 --> 00:14:08,259
[SPEAKER_02]: but um but no um I pretty much you know if there were the like the only thing that I actually had on my want list you know if you could call it that is an iPad and I'm waiting on that one because I'm going to Disneyland next month hello

177
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,601
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I can wait on that.

178
00:14:12,641 --> 00:14:13,642
[SPEAKER_02]: I have my netbook.

179
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:14,122
[SPEAKER_02]: It works.

180
00:14:14,722 --> 00:14:23,346
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's sort of like, like I'd said, you know, back during Hanukkah, Christmas-ka, Kwanza-ka, whatever holiday was going on.

181
00:14:23,366 --> 00:14:24,727
[SPEAKER_07]: Insert politically correct statement here.

182
00:14:24,927 --> 00:14:25,227
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

183
00:14:25,707 --> 00:14:28,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Christmas, I can't remember how.

184
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:28,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Festivus.

185
00:14:29,489 --> 00:14:58,651
[SPEAKER_02]: so it's like I've got tons of stuff I don't really need anything and I've got tons of stuff to do you know it's like it's not like I can't just go and play Mass Effect that Rob loaned me I have no problem just going and playing Mass Effect that I bought myself but anyway but you know I've got I have great friends and I have a wonderful hubby who sometimes can be a jerk face but for the most part is really cool

186
00:14:59,267 --> 00:15:00,308
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to make me sick.

187
00:15:00,468 --> 00:15:02,571
[SPEAKER_08]: There's too much emotion on this fucking network tonight.

188
00:15:03,472 --> 00:15:07,716
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the most part, like I said, I've got everything I pretty much need.

189
00:15:08,016 --> 00:15:08,737
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm cool.

190
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,241
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not all gimme gimme anymore.

191
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:14,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I do like the ABBA song.

192
00:15:17,552 --> 00:15:35,183
[SPEAKER_08]: I was off last week because I went to Disneyland for Jamie's birthday I went to the final electronica that was the whole reason because I am such a nerd I had to go to the final electronica I've talked about it a million times on the show I don't want to re-explain it but you know it was really great to be there for the last show and everybody booing when they pulled the plug

193
00:15:35,843 --> 00:15:39,485
[SPEAKER_08]: A little disappointed that they just literally shut the lights off on everybody.

194
00:15:39,545 --> 00:15:40,425
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, grid's down.

195
00:15:40,705 --> 00:15:42,286
[SPEAKER_08]: LOL, bye, get out.

196
00:15:42,746 --> 00:15:48,188
[SPEAKER_08]: I got to see the Tron pinball machine, but Flynn's Arcade was so crowded because people knew it was the last night it would be operating.

197
00:15:48,488 --> 00:15:49,549
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Dan's friend has one.

198
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:50,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, really?

199
00:15:50,749 --> 00:16:15,317
[SPEAKER_08]: has the deluxe edition too I need his address yeah I'm gonna go play uh supposedly they're keeping the Tron pinball machine at Disneyland it'll be like the one Tron thing still left in the parks um but it was it was kind of a crowded day um so we didn't get to do a whole whole lot but electronica but that's what we went for and I was happy um I did the driving so I didn't get to play a lot of games in the car sadly Loki you you guys have actually been out because you I

200
00:16:15,777 --> 00:16:18,038
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys weren't on the last show before the vacation, right?

201
00:16:18,058 --> 00:16:19,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that was the Jason and Alan show, right?

202
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:21,540
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, because it was Easter.

203
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, how was your Easter?

204
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,781
[SPEAKER_08]: What have you been up to, Loki, personally?

205
00:16:24,141 --> 00:16:33,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Not much, just hanging around the house and took Josh over to my mom's house and did the egg hunt and stuff.

206
00:16:33,445 --> 00:16:34,946
[SPEAKER_07]: He didn't really care about that stuff, though.

207
00:16:35,126 --> 00:16:35,767
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

208
00:16:58,462 --> 00:17:02,123
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, what video games have been in your world this week?

209
00:17:21,204 --> 00:17:25,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not so much actually playing, but we've been doing playthrough watching lately, Dan and I have.

210
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:26,649
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fair.

211
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:34,016
[SPEAKER_02]: So we watched a playthrough of Samurai Shodown because my friend Gary had never, he didn't even know about the game.

212
00:17:34,517 --> 00:17:36,198
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're like, what planet are you on?

213
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:38,080
[SPEAKER_02]: And how are we letting you in our house?

214
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,101
[SPEAKER_08]: We're fixing this right now.

215
00:17:39,501 --> 00:17:40,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

216
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:46,327
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were even explaining some of the bad translation in it, some of the English, which was funny.

217
00:17:46,868 --> 00:17:51,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how we were calling Amoksa a happy funster.

218
00:17:52,393 --> 00:18:00,800
[SPEAKER_02]: And just showing, even talking about, because a lot of the characters in the game are based on historical and cultural fictional characters.

219
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,381
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were trying to explain.

220
00:18:02,561 --> 00:18:03,642
[SPEAKER_02]: It was pretty cool.

221
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:07,724
[SPEAKER_02]: and then today we're actually watching a playthrough of Klonoa.

222
00:18:08,684 --> 00:18:10,705
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I said my next cat's name is going to be Klonoa.

223
00:18:10,745 --> 00:18:11,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I saw that on Facebook.

224
00:18:11,585 --> 00:18:13,365
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to get a rat named Hupow.

225
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:15,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because it's fun to say Hupow.

226
00:18:16,706 --> 00:18:28,309
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually, you know, I've got a new job so I've, and since I'm also in school full time and still have all of the graphic design projects that I took on while I wasn't working.

227
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:34,872
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been a busy bee, so I haven't really had that much time to sit and really play through anything.

228
00:18:35,292 --> 00:18:39,234
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't even had time to play much WoW, which... Oh my gosh!

229
00:18:40,575 --> 00:18:45,517
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done like two dungeons all week, and then one of them was so fail that I quit halfway through.

230
00:18:45,993 --> 00:18:46,413
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate that.

231
00:18:46,433 --> 00:18:50,076
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it just derails your spirit for the game for a whole week.

232
00:18:50,236 --> 00:18:50,476
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

233
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,217
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just like, ugh, screw these people.

234
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:53,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are Horde players so stupid?

235
00:18:53,998 --> 00:18:57,681
[SPEAKER_08]: One of my friends was telling me today about how Final Fantasy XIII too did that to him.

236
00:18:58,061 --> 00:19:04,345
[SPEAKER_08]: He was running around for literally three hours trying to figure out what to do and realized he was in the wrong time thing.

237
00:19:04,445 --> 00:19:08,688
[SPEAKER_08]: They went to the wrong part of the story and he was supposed to be in a chocobo that jumps.

238
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:15,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you know how I feel when my Kingdom Hearts 2 game glitched when I skipped a planet.

239
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:16,833
[SPEAKER_02]: and couldn't go back.

240
00:19:17,434 --> 00:19:21,155
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually skipped all of Agrabah.

241
00:19:21,175 --> 00:19:26,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Going to our chat room at chat.orangelongeradio.com, Breakman is in there saying, Sky doesn't have children or pets for their safety.

242
00:19:27,097 --> 00:19:30,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I am the wicked stepfather to two kitties.

243
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:36,341
[SPEAKER_08]: My other half, Alan, when we moved in together, he brought old kitties.

244
00:19:36,421 --> 00:19:37,781
[SPEAKER_08]: They're 12 years old this month, I believe.

245
00:19:38,081 --> 00:19:38,962
[SPEAKER_02]: They're getting old.

246
00:19:40,542 --> 00:19:42,163
[SPEAKER_08]: They're Medicare kitties, but they're still cute as hell.

247
00:19:45,111 --> 00:19:47,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and sometimes Sanrio will let me pet her.

248
00:19:47,852 --> 00:19:50,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Maruko is really an attention whore.

249
00:19:50,172 --> 00:19:50,672
[SPEAKER_08]: He is cool.

250
00:19:50,692 --> 00:20:04,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, all I have to do, like, I go into bed, lie down, get my DS open, like, I'm going to play DS or B on my iPhone, and, like, within minutes, and he jumps up on the bed, and he doesn't just, like, get on my feet like some cats do or get on my chest or whatever.

251
00:20:04,716 --> 00:20:05,956
[SPEAKER_08]: He gets up in my face.

252
00:20:06,056 --> 00:20:07,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I am here, bitch.

253
00:20:07,337 --> 00:20:08,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Pet me right now.

254
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:11,018
[SPEAKER_02]: I told you what Shermie used to do when we had our bed on the floor.

255
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:17,540
[SPEAKER_02]: She used to crawl in under the sheets in the middle of it because Dan and I use, we have separate blankets because we're both sheet hogs.

256
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,441
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just use our own blankets.

257
00:20:19,961 --> 00:20:27,143
[SPEAKER_02]: And Shermie would crawl under and then put her head on my shoulder and just start purring away and sleep on my shoulder in the morning.

258
00:20:27,824 --> 00:20:28,364
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cute.

259
00:20:28,544 --> 00:20:30,344
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually just get up, bitch, and feed me.

260
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:33,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else for your gaming week?

261
00:20:33,646 --> 00:20:33,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

262
00:20:35,273 --> 00:20:35,473
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

263
00:20:35,773 --> 00:20:36,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

264
00:20:36,353 --> 00:20:36,893
[SPEAKER_08]: My gaming week.

265
00:20:37,934 --> 00:20:41,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, not a whole lot because I've been focused on one game.

266
00:20:41,815 --> 00:20:43,215
[SPEAKER_08]: What did you want to say, Jamie?

267
00:20:43,235 --> 00:20:44,116
[SPEAKER_08]: You thought of something, didn't you?

268
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:48,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn stupid panda shit not installing.

269
00:20:49,317 --> 00:20:50,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you, Blizzard.

270
00:20:50,197 --> 00:20:50,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you.

271
00:20:50,957 --> 00:20:52,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, you got in the WoW beta and it won't work.

272
00:20:53,266 --> 00:20:55,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I left my hard drive at home and I was going to copy your files.

273
00:20:55,968 --> 00:20:59,612
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say something about, well, this is why they call it a beta, but I don't want to get hit.

274
00:20:59,632 --> 00:21:01,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I have a 4 gig flash drive on me.

275
00:21:01,073 --> 00:21:02,154
[SPEAKER_08]: You can use that guy.

276
00:21:02,174 --> 00:21:03,235
[SPEAKER_08]: You can borrow that guy over there.

277
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:05,757
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a 1 terabyte hard drive just sitting there.

278
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:06,598
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a flash drive on me.

279
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:07,038
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

280
00:21:07,939 --> 00:21:08,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow.

281
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:19,089
[SPEAKER_02]: But my thought is because I've moved my WoW folder in full before, I figured what I might be able to do is copy your installs and have them update on my computer.

282
00:21:19,734 --> 00:21:22,656
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

283
00:21:42,476 --> 00:21:43,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I just kept fast forwarding through the whole thing.

284
00:21:43,998 --> 00:21:45,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Did the guy say nanu nanu?

285
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:45,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, he did.

286
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,786
[SPEAKER_02]: The very last thing, you know, after he does his splooge business is you hear nanu nanu and then it fades to the credits.

287
00:21:52,908 --> 00:21:55,150
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, my childhood has just been raped.

288
00:21:56,371 --> 00:21:58,193
[SPEAKER_08]: This porn wasn't from the 70s.

289
00:21:58,253 --> 00:21:58,333
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

290
00:21:58,433 --> 00:21:59,855
[SPEAKER_08]: It was from like last year.

291
00:21:59,935 --> 00:22:01,076
[SPEAKER_02]: It was done this year.

292
00:22:01,136 --> 00:22:01,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God.

293
00:22:02,017 --> 00:22:21,020
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's called Mork and Mindy the Dream Zone Parody and it's like hideous and awful but the girl does look a lot like Pam Dauber and the guy that played Mork actually does a very good cracked out Robin Williams impression I realize there's change in all we've been talking about tonight but last I checked we weren't going to become a porn show

294
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,961
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had to get that out because it was funny.

295
00:22:24,361 --> 00:22:25,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let me talk about my game of the week.

296
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:26,641
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really been one game.

297
00:22:26,761 --> 00:22:27,802
[SPEAKER_08]: It's still Mass Effect 2.

298
00:22:28,142 --> 00:22:30,142
[SPEAKER_08]: But I did go through all the DLC this week.

299
00:22:30,262 --> 00:22:41,345
[SPEAKER_08]: I said, because I realize I am right at the very end and if I do the next mission, I set off a sequel of events where I won't get the best ending unless I play it to completion.

300
00:22:41,425 --> 00:22:43,126
[SPEAKER_08]: People who have played the game will know what I'm talking about.

301
00:22:43,466 --> 00:22:50,068
[SPEAKER_08]: And Alan's like a step ahead of me and he said, whoa, whoa, whoa, don't do that mission until you are absolutely ready to finish the game.

302
00:22:50,868 --> 00:22:51,429
[SPEAKER_08]: So I said, all right.

303
00:22:51,449 --> 00:22:52,590
[SPEAKER_08]: So I did every side quest.

304
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,111
[SPEAKER_08]: I did Overlord.

305
00:22:54,271 --> 00:22:54,972
[SPEAKER_08]: I did Arrival.

306
00:22:55,092 --> 00:22:56,113
[SPEAKER_08]: I did Shadowbroker.

307
00:22:56,153 --> 00:22:56,953
[SPEAKER_08]: I played all of it.

308
00:22:56,993 --> 00:22:57,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Did Arrival enjoy it?

309
00:22:58,535 --> 00:23:03,399
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kind of mad at myself for giving EA that much money, but damn, it was good.

310
00:23:03,459 --> 00:23:06,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially of note, I think my favorite out of all the DLC was Arrival.

311
00:23:07,502 --> 00:23:34,828
[SPEAKER_08]: and the reason why I think I preferred that one I mean Shadow Broker had a lot of cool stuff to it and there was a lot of great scenes I realize that's kind of commonly people's favorites the reason why I really loved Arrival was Arrival really felt like an episode of a freaking science fiction show like Battlestar Galactica or something like I am playing an episode of a show watching it play out it has its very cliche twists part way through a good beginning middle end I mean it plays out like an episode of a TV show and

312
00:23:35,328 --> 00:23:44,211
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of wish, as much as I'm kind of eh on DLC, like this is something I really like seeing in games, is this like really true episodic content.

313
00:23:44,391 --> 00:23:49,452
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, I can support DLC when it's pretty awesome like that.

314
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:51,153
[SPEAKER_08]: That was my favorite by far was Arrival.

315
00:23:51,953 --> 00:24:09,871
[SPEAKER_08]: and Shadow Broker kind of felt the same way too I realize it kind of plays in a lot more to the greater story and I think Arrival in some regards is supposed to tie it's kind of to bridge two and three together which I get but it still felt a lot like a standalone to me I will have beaten that game by this time tomorrow I'm pretty close and then

316
00:24:10,592 --> 00:24:16,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks to the sale on Mass Effect 3 this week, I have my copy of Mass Effect 3 sitting in the screen craft ready to go.

317
00:24:17,714 --> 00:24:21,416
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can be really disappointed at the ending just like everybody else.

318
00:24:21,556 --> 00:24:31,699
[SPEAKER_08]: But the experience and the, what, probably 25 hours of Mass Effect 1 and 35 so far of Mass Effect 2 plus whatever I spend there will at least be worth it.

319
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:33,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, how about your gaming week?

320
00:24:35,863 --> 00:24:39,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I started playing some more stuff on my PS3.

321
00:24:40,988 --> 00:24:46,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, Infamous, I finally played a little bit of that, and it's okay.

322
00:24:47,395 --> 00:24:48,035
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks old.

323
00:24:49,036 --> 00:24:50,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Not even that old, but it's just...

324
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:53,906
[SPEAKER_07]: It's alright, I may finish it.

325
00:24:54,546 --> 00:24:57,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, all my time is being taken up by Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3.

326
00:24:58,109 --> 00:25:00,131
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, finally jumped on that bandwagon.

327
00:25:01,312 --> 00:25:13,261
[SPEAKER_07]: After playing Modern Warfare 1 for a long time, well, it seems like a long time, but a few months, we decided to go ahead and make the shift to Modern Warfare 3, and it's pretty awesome.

328
00:25:13,662 --> 00:25:15,083
[SPEAKER_07]: I enjoy it, playing...

329
00:25:16,023 --> 00:25:21,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty much just all multiplayer, because the campaign, I can never really sit down and play that for long enough.

330
00:25:21,668 --> 00:25:22,969
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm enjoying it.

331
00:25:23,069 --> 00:25:31,415
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the fact that, first off, the game still supports System Link, which is great, because our internet kind of sucks at my work.

332
00:25:31,855 --> 00:25:35,158
[SPEAKER_07]: Ironically enough, it fixed itself when we had a power outage.

333
00:25:35,218 --> 00:25:37,460
[SPEAKER_07]: All it took was shutting something off and turning it back on.

334
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:43,584
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the old IT standby, and yet someone... Calling Comcast tech support.

335
00:25:43,644 --> 00:25:44,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Dude, dude, dude.

336
00:25:44,645 --> 00:25:46,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, did you try power cycling?

337
00:25:46,927 --> 00:25:48,407
[SPEAKER_08]: I love how it's called power cycling.

338
00:25:48,668 --> 00:25:49,788
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you power cycle?

339
00:25:49,828 --> 00:25:51,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it's fucking something out of Tron.

340
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you power cycle the cable modem?

341
00:25:53,871 --> 00:25:55,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, just hit that big switch that says power.

342
00:25:55,772 --> 00:25:57,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, now count to ten slowly with me.

343
00:25:58,534 --> 00:25:58,594
[SPEAKER_08]: One.

344
00:25:59,275 --> 00:26:00,477
[SPEAKER_08]: One, two, three.

345
00:26:00,557 --> 00:26:01,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, now turn it back.

346
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:09,348
[SPEAKER_07]: So instead of us having no connection to Xbox Live, we still have a shitty connection to Xbox Live.

347
00:26:09,428 --> 00:26:11,511
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess a shitty connection is better than no connection.

348
00:26:11,531 --> 00:26:12,852
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're playing System Link, so it doesn't matter.

349
00:26:13,753 --> 00:26:16,977
[SPEAKER_07]: But I like the fact that not only do they have System Link, but they have...

350
00:26:17,758 --> 00:26:18,479
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

351
00:26:42,300 --> 00:27:05,985
[SPEAKER_07]: um so I like the fact that they added that because they really didn't have to do that um which is nice I wish Grand Theft Auto 5 did that because I I just wish that that has system link because that'll be you know worth it but actually I picked up the game on um on PS3 and on 360 so I have it on both platforms I actually play with some of my co-workers on PS3 I'm actually for well I play online um on PS3 I haven't played online with my 360 yet but um

352
00:27:08,069 --> 00:27:08,710
[SPEAKER_07]: I may, you know.

353
00:27:10,031 --> 00:27:14,134
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that means I have to create an elite clan, so we'll do the OLR army.

354
00:27:14,855 --> 00:27:16,296
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, get the OLR army.

355
00:27:16,856 --> 00:27:17,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

356
00:27:17,517 --> 00:27:17,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

357
00:27:18,418 --> 00:27:23,302
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, I guess that wraps it up for our gaming weeks, so we will get into some news here shortly.

358
00:27:23,682 --> 00:27:25,103
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, we usually do housekeeping.

359
00:27:25,944 --> 00:27:31,048
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we said the pretty big part that we were waiting to say, so we'll...

360
00:27:31,949 --> 00:27:32,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Ask Orange Lounge

361
00:27:50,562 --> 00:27:55,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, I do want to say, of course, as always, since we are on Facebook, we are on Google+, add us.

362
00:27:55,845 --> 00:27:57,526
[SPEAKER_08]: Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge.

363
00:27:58,667 --> 00:28:01,888
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, Google+, just look for Orange Lounge Radio.

364
00:28:01,928 --> 00:28:03,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

365
00:28:04,009 --> 00:28:05,690
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's get into some gaming news.

366
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,491
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, why don't you start us off with the news this week?

367
00:28:07,931 --> 00:28:10,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo, Nintendo, Nintendo

368
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:28,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Mario Bros.

369
00:28:28,366 --> 00:28:29,607
[SPEAKER_07]: with Miis Super Mario Bros.

370
00:28:29,687 --> 00:28:30,068
[SPEAKER_07]: with Miis

371
00:28:48,024 --> 00:28:50,606
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't know, is that really a step up?

372
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:52,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Do I really need a Wii U for that?

373
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:57,813
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, because you're just giving me the game that you had last year, or was it last year?

374
00:28:57,833 --> 00:28:58,453
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

375
00:28:58,933 --> 00:29:04,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Recently, on the Wii, but now you're adding, you know, Mii support.

376
00:29:04,318 --> 00:29:04,979
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, something that...

377
00:29:05,659 --> 00:29:16,443
[SPEAKER_07]: On a modern console, ones that have updates to their games, you could just patch in instead of releasing a whole new game for it.

378
00:29:16,703 --> 00:29:19,324
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought for some reason you could already do the Miis in the Wii game that was out.

379
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,344
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why I thought that.

380
00:29:21,165 --> 00:29:26,887
[SPEAKER_08]: But I mean, okay, at least it'll be HD and native widescreen support or whatever.

381
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:28,807
[SPEAKER_08]: There's got to be another catch.

382
00:29:28,948 --> 00:29:30,368
[SPEAKER_08]: There's got to be something they're not saying.

383
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:32,509
[SPEAKER_08]: I cannot believe...

384
00:29:33,129 --> 00:29:35,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially if this ends up being a launch title, which we don't really know.

385
00:29:36,073 --> 00:29:38,195
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm assuming it's a launch window title.

386
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:39,036
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lot of 3DS stuff.

387
00:29:39,176 --> 00:29:43,922
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it could be a launch title, especially if it's based off New Super Mario Bros.

388
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:44,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Wii.

389
00:29:44,463 --> 00:29:44,843
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

390
00:29:44,863 --> 00:29:46,325
[SPEAKER_08]: They've got to be rushing something.

391
00:29:46,365 --> 00:29:51,131
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they're going to learn from the mistake of the 3DS, and they're going to have a AAA something out.

392
00:29:52,231 --> 00:29:52,812
[SPEAKER_08]: You're probably right.

393
00:29:52,872 --> 00:29:53,572
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably Mario.

394
00:29:53,932 --> 00:29:57,053
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm curious what the little gimmick is going to be.

395
00:29:58,054 --> 00:30:05,737
[SPEAKER_08]: How could Nintendo put out a launch title for the Wii U and not somehow integrate the whole screen in your lap concept?

396
00:30:07,037 --> 00:30:14,280
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be something derpy like when you go in a pipe, you're on your screen and your other partners are still out there in the world.

397
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:15,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Watch.

398
00:30:15,941 --> 00:30:18,882
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be something silly like that.

399
00:30:20,914 --> 00:30:26,781
[SPEAKER_07]: I have an idea what this is already, but we're not covering that until later.

400
00:30:27,682 --> 00:30:32,026
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a port of a game that's coming to another platform that they're going to do some things.

401
00:30:32,547 --> 00:30:37,072
[SPEAKER_07]: That other game may integrate with the Wii U since it has two screens.

402
00:30:38,836 --> 00:30:39,897
[SPEAKER_08]: I can see where you're going with this.

403
00:30:39,998 --> 00:30:41,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody who's been paying attention to the news this week knows.

404
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Otherwise, we'll get to it in a minute.

405
00:30:43,902 --> 00:30:45,744
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I don't know.

406
00:30:46,604 --> 00:30:53,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Besides Wii U, Mario, they're promising that they're going to reveal Pikmin.

407
00:30:54,793 --> 00:30:55,474
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm assuming...

408
00:30:56,004 --> 00:30:56,885
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

409
00:31:15,515 --> 00:31:18,476
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really know what... I don't know.

410
00:31:18,496 --> 00:31:19,956
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess we'll find out what it's about.

411
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:22,676
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm not excited about Pikmin.

412
00:31:23,596 --> 00:31:24,397
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't really care about it.

413
00:31:24,417 --> 00:31:29,678
[SPEAKER_08]: It's one of those series I just kind of missed because I was never really... You know, I didn't get into the... Wasn't the first one on the 64?

414
00:31:29,758 --> 00:31:31,178
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember.

415
00:31:31,378 --> 00:31:32,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Or was it a GameCube?

416
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:34,638
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they were both GameCube ones.

417
00:31:34,738 --> 00:31:35,899
[SPEAKER_08]: I just missed the boat on Pikmin.

418
00:31:36,219 --> 00:31:39,839
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand people really love it, but it's one of the series I never got to play.

419
00:31:39,859 --> 00:31:40,880
[SPEAKER_08]: I was too busy with F-Zero.

420
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's put it that way.

421
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:43,320
Yeah.

422
00:31:43,854 --> 00:31:46,856
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be cool if they announced an F-Zero game for the Wii U. Don't tease me.

423
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:03,248
[SPEAKER_08]: These things are going to happen.

424
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:10,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Microsoft did announce that Halo 4 is going to launch worldwide Tuesday, November 6th.

425
00:32:11,552 --> 00:32:15,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Funny that they did the whole integration with Conan O'Brien.

426
00:32:15,673 --> 00:32:18,214
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a long segment on the Conan show on TBS.

427
00:32:18,694 --> 00:32:25,517
[SPEAKER_08]: Nine minutes about Halo and some funny voice like they were the background guys doing moving or something.

428
00:32:25,537 --> 00:32:26,217
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a little silly.

429
00:32:26,257 --> 00:32:27,458
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope it's in the game.

430
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:30,339
[SPEAKER_08]: It was very red versus blue to me.

431
00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:34,201
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was cool because it was Conan and Andy Richter who are both awesome.

432
00:32:35,562 --> 00:32:43,427
[SPEAKER_08]: So, of course, there's the whole little corporate speak of with Halo 4 leading the charge, we're confident 2012 will be the most successful year in Xbox history.

433
00:32:45,068 --> 00:32:52,013
[SPEAKER_08]: We are beginning a new saga with Halo 4 and embarking on a journey that will encompass the next decade of Halo games and experiences.

434
00:32:52,633 --> 00:32:54,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Confirmed, Halo 4, 5, and 6.

435
00:32:55,475 --> 00:32:55,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Right there.

436
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Confirmed.

437
00:32:57,518 --> 00:32:59,719
[SPEAKER_07]: and 7 and 8 and 9.

438
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:05,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, to be fair, they already said in a while this Halo 4 would be the first game in a new trilogy.

439
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:09,265
[SPEAKER_08]: So it really, as much as I'm being sarcastic, it really isn't new news.

440
00:33:09,285 --> 00:33:12,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, I don't see a problem with a new Halo game coming out without Bungie.

441
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:15,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I understand that Bungie was kind of the driving force behind the last...

442
00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:17,509
[SPEAKER_07]: and so on.

443
00:33:42,217 --> 00:33:55,708
[SPEAKER_07]: um it hasn't hurt sales at all so I don't think that the fact that Halo 4 is going to come from a different studio that there's going to be any less quality in the game I think if anything it could be just like kind of fresh eyes on it I guess

444
00:33:57,904 --> 00:34:01,127
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks cool, just like the brief little snippets of things that they have on there

445
00:34:19,362 --> 00:34:25,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, uh, some of our chatters, Actdeft at chat.orange.radio.com says, I'm an Xbox person and I'm not excited about Halo at all.

446
00:34:26,487 --> 00:34:29,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Gamer Girl says, Halo is overplayed, just saying.

447
00:34:29,749 --> 00:34:36,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Porkchop says, Halo needs a kick to the crotch, one way to kill Master Chef, and Chef is not a typo.

448
00:34:37,274 --> 00:34:38,535
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, surely he meant to say Chief.

449
00:34:39,036 --> 00:34:40,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, Technus says, I like Halo.

450
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,098
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not the shit everybody wants to believe it is.

451
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:43,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it's not...

452
00:34:44,801 --> 00:34:45,702
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not the shit.

453
00:34:45,722 --> 00:34:47,043
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that means like, yeah, you're the shit.

454
00:34:47,103 --> 00:34:50,146
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not the shit as everybody wants to believe it is, but I won't knock it.

455
00:34:50,387 --> 00:34:52,048
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's kind of how I feel about Halo.

456
00:34:52,509 --> 00:34:57,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I'm not gonna like, oh my god, melt fanboy Halo, but it's a decent series.

457
00:34:57,093 --> 00:35:00,277
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a reason why it propelled the Xbox the way it did.

458
00:35:00,317 --> 00:35:03,019
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a great first-person shooter, especially on the original Xbox.

459
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:03,920
[SPEAKER_07]: And it still is.

460
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,561
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, in what...

461
00:35:05,822 --> 00:35:08,723
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't think that they're doing another Gears of War game.

462
00:35:08,963 --> 00:35:10,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm sure they'll find a way.

463
00:35:10,123 --> 00:35:11,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Nah, they'll find a way.

464
00:35:11,244 --> 00:35:16,065
[SPEAKER_08]: But supposedly, Gears of War is really, really dead and ain't coming back.

465
00:35:17,145 --> 00:35:20,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, here's one other thing I want to say about this before we go on to the next story.

466
00:35:20,886 --> 00:35:23,427
[SPEAKER_08]: November 6th is the day that the game is coming out.

467
00:35:23,927 --> 00:35:25,468
[SPEAKER_08]: The first Tuesday in November.

468
00:35:26,248 --> 00:35:30,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anything else really big every four years especially?

469
00:35:30,889 --> 00:35:31,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope.

470
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:36,684
[SPEAKER_08]: that people might kind of be caring about this year.

471
00:35:36,704 --> 00:35:38,886
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of passion around it.

472
00:35:39,166 --> 00:35:40,468
[SPEAKER_08]: It has nothing to do with video games.

473
00:35:40,508 --> 00:35:42,229
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think Call of Duty comes out that day.

474
00:35:42,309 --> 00:35:43,150
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no.

475
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:45,553
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called Election Day here in the U.S.

476
00:35:45,593 --> 00:35:46,133
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

477
00:35:46,514 --> 00:35:47,255
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Election Day.

478
00:35:47,295 --> 00:35:48,756
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we have this guy, the president.

479
00:35:49,697 --> 00:35:51,279
[SPEAKER_08]: You ever heard the name Barack Obama?

480
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Barack Obama.

481
00:35:53,281 --> 00:35:55,323
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't listen to that hip-hop music, okay?

482
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,221
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's the leader of our country.

483
00:36:03,622 --> 00:36:06,223
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a pretty amazing title for a hip-hop artist.

484
00:36:06,283 --> 00:36:13,206
[SPEAKER_08]: He has to run for office again because there's somebody else named Mitt Romney that thinks he shouldn't be president anymore.

485
00:36:13,226 --> 00:36:14,627
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a terrible hip-hop name.

486
00:36:16,491 --> 00:36:19,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Look, it's not a politics show and it's not a porn show.

487
00:36:19,694 --> 00:36:32,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Just an interesting observation, but I guess Microsoft got called on it and it was very like, you know, the statement they kind of released was like, well, we think a lot of people will be excited about both, you know, whatever.

488
00:36:33,207 --> 00:36:33,507
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

489
00:36:34,187 --> 00:36:37,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, let us hold our release of our game so you can have your little election.

490
00:36:38,251 --> 00:36:40,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Or we can just move on like, you know, the rest of the world is...

491
00:36:41,414 --> 00:36:42,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's be real.

492
00:36:42,895 --> 00:36:47,099
[SPEAKER_08]: In this day and age, you can vote absentee and Amazon delivers to your door.

493
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:47,840
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

494
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:51,323
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to leave the house to participate in democracy or fragging online.

495
00:36:52,424 --> 00:36:53,244
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been absentee.

496
00:36:53,525 --> 00:36:54,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Voting takes like a few minutes.

497
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:56,547
[SPEAKER_08]: I like to vote in person.

498
00:36:56,707 --> 00:36:57,728
[SPEAKER_08]: I personally don't vote absentee.

499
00:36:57,768 --> 00:37:00,390
[SPEAKER_07]: How about putting those voting booths inside GameStop?

500
00:37:01,872 --> 00:37:02,112
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

501
00:37:04,474 --> 00:37:05,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Or another retailer.

502
00:37:06,916 --> 00:37:09,098
[SPEAKER_02]: That would actually be a really good idea.

503
00:37:11,368 --> 00:37:12,328
[SPEAKER_02]: Get more young voters.

504
00:37:12,768 --> 00:37:14,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Go to Claire's, then go vote?

505
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:15,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Why not?

506
00:37:16,349 --> 00:37:17,189
[SPEAKER_02]: They should have them at the mall.

507
00:37:17,729 --> 00:37:19,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamba Juice, free smoothie with your vote.

508
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,690
[SPEAKER_08]: I could get a Cinnabon while I vote.

509
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:25,811
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's a lot better than going to the Lutheran church around the corner from my house.

510
00:37:25,831 --> 00:37:26,331
[SPEAKER_08]: That is true.

511
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:33,312
[SPEAKER_08]: I do feel like I have to go to the grade school to vote here, and I don't have kids, so I feel really awkward going to the grade school.

512
00:37:33,332 --> 00:37:35,252
[SPEAKER_08]: They're going to make you sit down at the really small desk.

513
00:37:35,272 --> 00:37:38,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you have to go in the library, and I'm like, I'm a big person.

514
00:37:38,573 --> 00:37:40,834
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hitting my head on the ceiling.

515
00:37:41,394 --> 00:37:42,114
[SPEAKER_08]: What's going on here?

516
00:37:42,154 --> 00:37:43,254
[SPEAKER_08]: It feels awkward.

517
00:37:44,175 --> 00:37:48,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Guys like me aren't supposed to be hanging around elementary schools unless I have kids, and I don't.

518
00:37:48,156 --> 00:37:49,856
[SPEAKER_08]: So what's my excuse?

519
00:37:49,876 --> 00:37:52,437
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I have to go to the Lutheran church to drop mine off.

520
00:37:53,017 --> 00:37:54,878
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think I'm going to burst into flames or something.

521
00:37:55,938 --> 00:37:57,219
[SPEAKER_08]: You get to vote, then you get some Kool-Aid.

522
00:37:57,919 --> 00:37:58,179
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

523
00:37:58,659 --> 00:37:59,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on, moving on.

524
00:37:59,779 --> 00:38:01,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Dark Sakura, take us to a new story.

525
00:38:02,193 --> 00:38:09,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for those of us who are blessed with iPhones, we have a great game coming up for iOS, although I have no idea how the fuck we're going to play it.

526
00:38:10,075 --> 00:38:12,116
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, can I read some great chat comments real quick?

527
00:38:12,136 --> 00:38:12,616
[SPEAKER_08]: Lord, what?

528
00:38:13,336 --> 00:38:15,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Infanel, I love this comment in chat room.

529
00:38:15,617 --> 00:38:18,338
[SPEAKER_08]: If corporations are people, can I vote Valve for president?

530
00:38:19,038 --> 00:38:19,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

531
00:38:19,698 --> 00:38:22,779
[SPEAKER_08]: GameGuru says, can I vote for Master Chief as my president?

532
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:24,299
[SPEAKER_08]: Good way to tie the stories together.

533
00:38:24,339 --> 00:38:24,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Appreciate that.

534
00:38:24,919 --> 00:38:26,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know who I usually write in.

535
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Bill the Cat.

536
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Bill the Cat.

537
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,461
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been doing this show with you for 10 years.

538
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:30,741
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Bill the Cat very well.

539
00:38:31,328 --> 00:38:34,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Why don't they just call Obama Master Chief?

540
00:38:35,692 --> 00:38:37,494
[SPEAKER_08]: I would call him my Master Chief.

541
00:38:37,574 --> 00:38:40,537
[SPEAKER_08]: He is Master Chief.

542
00:38:41,177 --> 00:38:42,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's how you win this.

543
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:43,920
[SPEAKER_07]: You put Obama in your fucking campaign.

544
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:49,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Obama comes in, dressed up like Master Chief, kicks down a door, pulls off his helmet and says, go vote.

545
00:38:50,686 --> 00:38:51,967
[SPEAKER_08]: And that'll get people in there.

546
00:38:52,028 --> 00:38:54,190
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of how the Bin Laden speech went down.

547
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:55,090
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, let's...

548
00:38:55,972 --> 00:38:57,655
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember him being in Master Chiefs.

549
00:38:57,856 --> 00:38:59,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh wait, that was when they made fun of him on late night.

550
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, no politics, moving on.

551
00:39:02,614 --> 00:39:05,995
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, this awesome game I'm referring to is Marvel vs. Capcom 2.

552
00:39:06,975 --> 00:39:09,636
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to be on iOS on April 25th.

553
00:39:10,116 --> 00:39:12,557
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only got the British price, which is £2.99.

554
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:17,018
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm assuming it's going to be a $5 game over in the US.

555
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:23,620
[SPEAKER_02]: It said there's nothing yet announced as an upgraded version for iPad.

556
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,421
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't show the virtual D-pad on the screen.

557
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:30,303
[SPEAKER_02]: So who knows exactly how it's going to control.

558
00:39:30,423 --> 00:39:31,323
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey...

559
00:39:31,923 --> 00:39:34,125
[SPEAKER_07]: The virtual d-pad is paid to unlock content.

560
00:39:35,686 --> 00:39:40,168
[SPEAKER_02]: On top of that, it has all 56 fighters from the original.

561
00:39:40,309 --> 00:39:42,130
[SPEAKER_08]: That was nice of Capcom to do for a change.

562
00:39:45,452 --> 00:39:46,973
[SPEAKER_08]: You fucking know they thought about it.

563
00:39:47,033 --> 00:39:48,574
[SPEAKER_08]: You know there was that guy in the boardroom.

564
00:39:49,354 --> 00:39:51,956
[SPEAKER_08]: We could have, you know, eight characters that come with it.

565
00:39:52,136 --> 00:39:54,618
[SPEAKER_08]: And then for 99 cents, do eight more and eight more.

566
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:56,499
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

567
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:57,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Meh.

568
00:39:58,223 --> 00:40:15,944
[SPEAKER_08]: But for real, Marvel vs. Capcom 2 on the iPhone If I had an iCade for the iPad If I had, which I don't think is on tonight's show roll, so I'll say it That Midway game on the iOS devices, that Midway Arcade Treasures Got support for the iCade this week

569
00:40:16,485 --> 00:40:17,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, very yes.

570
00:40:17,785 --> 00:40:18,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Good idea.

571
00:40:18,906 --> 00:40:20,606
[SPEAKER_08]: That helped that game immensely.

572
00:40:21,027 --> 00:40:28,009
[SPEAKER_08]: So, IK'd support for Marvel vs. Capcom 2 would make it, you know, for those that don't own anything else, I guess, would make it desirable.

573
00:40:28,029 --> 00:40:29,490
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I want IK'd to make?

574
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:30,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm?

575
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:35,372
[SPEAKER_02]: I want them to make those little miniature arcade cabinets like they had in the 80s.

576
00:40:36,252 --> 00:40:37,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so yeah, with the LEDs and everything?

577
00:40:37,933 --> 00:40:38,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

578
00:40:38,153 --> 00:40:38,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

579
00:40:38,593 --> 00:40:40,413
[SPEAKER_02]: I want them to make, like, little cabinets like that.

580
00:40:40,614 --> 00:40:41,214
[SPEAKER_02]: I should make one.

581
00:40:41,234 --> 00:40:43,475
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a friend of mine that had a Donkey Kong little LED game like that.

582
00:40:43,495 --> 00:40:44,315
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a friend that had the Pac-Man.

583
00:40:44,335 --> 00:40:44,635
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome.

584
00:40:45,987 --> 00:40:56,377
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I actually have a Frogger cabinet like that, like one of the really small LED ones, that I actually was going to convert into a MAME cabinet.

585
00:40:56,457 --> 00:40:57,938
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember when you bought that.

586
00:40:58,018 --> 00:40:59,920
[SPEAKER_08]: That was your whole $100 project, wasn't it?

587
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,061
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I didn't buy that.

588
00:41:01,141 --> 00:41:02,523
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually got that free from a co-worker.

589
00:41:03,423 --> 00:41:05,365
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but I have the internals for it.

590
00:41:05,385 --> 00:41:10,190
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a Pico ITX board and a tiny little LCD screen.

591
00:41:10,819 --> 00:41:12,062
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be awesome-tastic.

592
00:41:12,182 --> 00:41:18,959
[SPEAKER_07]: The only problem is there's no room to put the controls on there because you realize you're all yeah, I can't really fit buttons on this thing.

593
00:41:19,813 --> 00:41:30,083
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's what I was thinking Dan should do with his Transformer tablet, because it's an Android, and you can get MAME for Android, is to set that up.

594
00:41:30,463 --> 00:41:31,925
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, that's another story.

595
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:34,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Just don't buy an iPad, I mean, for arcade games.

596
00:41:35,348 --> 00:41:37,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Buy an arcade cabinet for arcade games.

597
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:40,573
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, seriously, you're going to be spending about the same amount of money.

598
00:41:40,593 --> 00:41:41,734
[SPEAKER_07]: You might as well have the authentic...

599
00:41:41,914 --> 00:41:42,354
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

600
00:41:42,655 --> 00:41:43,935
[SPEAKER_08]: That BurgerTime I was looking at was $500.

601
00:41:44,676 --> 00:41:45,777
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how much an iPad would cost.

602
00:41:46,177 --> 00:41:48,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I wanted an iPad for stuff other than games.

603
00:41:49,499 --> 00:41:50,600
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't coming out on iPad.

604
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:53,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Not like I don't already have three other copies of it anyway.

605
00:41:53,922 --> 00:41:54,302
[SPEAKER_02]: But still.

606
00:41:54,842 --> 00:41:56,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Gonna take you for a ride.

607
00:41:57,704 --> 00:41:58,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's move on with some more news.

608
00:42:00,253 --> 00:42:00,693
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

609
00:42:18,568 --> 00:42:40,672
[SPEAKER_08]: um so it is coming out in Japan no word on US but probably coming out around the same time I know you're very cynical about Animal Crossing and you could give two shits about the improved park bench sitting or whatever features they're actually adding into this one however I have a friend a real person that I know that said holy shit Animal Crossing is coming out time to get a 3DS shit you not Animal Crossing has its fans

610
00:42:41,472 --> 00:42:48,719
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand, it's just like Apple product fans where they're like, holy shit, Apple has a new thing coming out, I gotta go get it.

611
00:42:49,059 --> 00:42:51,161
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's just like this.

612
00:42:51,481 --> 00:43:03,192
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just glad that she spoke to me in that language for a change and didn't say... Well, I hope that when she plays it, she discovers a whole... It really makes a lot more sense in the Japanese version.

613
00:43:03,332 --> 00:43:07,496
[SPEAKER_07]: A wholly unique experience and not the same damn game again.

614
00:43:08,462 --> 00:43:11,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know I found my Japanese Animal Crossing?

615
00:43:12,414 --> 00:43:13,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so she brought up porn.

616
00:43:14,989 --> 00:43:16,049
[SPEAKER_08]: A long time ago.

617
00:43:16,069 --> 00:43:16,429
[SPEAKER_08]: A long time ago.

618
00:43:40,796 --> 00:43:43,758
[SPEAKER_08]: It's what the little animals say.

619
00:43:44,078 --> 00:43:48,580
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really fun to put in dirty words and hear how the little animals interpret them.

620
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:52,442
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, sorry for dumbing down the show.

621
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:54,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

622
00:43:55,937 --> 00:44:00,423
[SPEAKER_07]: They also announced that they're going to be doing a Kirby 20th Anniversary Edition on the Wii.

623
00:44:01,144 --> 00:44:08,594
[SPEAKER_07]: So, if you're even mildly interested in it, I would recommend picking it up, because if anything, remember those Mario... What?

624
00:44:09,114 --> 00:44:10,116
[SPEAKER_08]: You're recommending this?

625
00:44:10,316 --> 00:44:10,877
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't be... Look...

626
00:44:11,317 --> 00:44:15,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, hey, I'm recommending this because of the resale value of the last Mario game.

627
00:44:15,799 --> 00:44:18,841
[SPEAKER_07]: And the last Mario game was a stupid ROM conversion.

628
00:44:18,921 --> 00:44:21,422
[SPEAKER_07]: It literally was a ROM from the SNES.

629
00:44:21,582 --> 00:44:26,965
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, hey, we're going to just snap, you know, put this virtual console ROM on that disc.

630
00:44:27,245 --> 00:44:27,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Done!

631
00:44:28,005 --> 00:44:29,746
[SPEAKER_08]: No disrespect to the Kirby fans.

632
00:44:29,806 --> 00:44:30,807
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a great franchise.

633
00:44:30,907 --> 00:44:33,648
[SPEAKER_08]: However, you know, they did this with Mario.

634
00:44:33,688 --> 00:44:35,109
[SPEAKER_08]: They did it with Zelda back on the GameCube.

635
00:44:35,149 --> 00:44:36,770
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a pre-order bonus only thing.

636
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:39,311
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was basically a virtual console on a disc.

637
00:44:39,871 --> 00:44:44,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, if they get some ones that we haven't seen elsewhere out on there, it'll be kind of awesome.

638
00:44:45,353 --> 00:44:49,275
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it'd be neat if they were, I don't know, redone, but I think it's just a bunch of virtual console games.

639
00:44:49,415 --> 00:44:51,976
[SPEAKER_07]: At least this time, it's not going to be just one ROM.

640
00:44:51,996 --> 00:44:53,957
[SPEAKER_07]: So that'd be kind of neat.

641
00:44:54,477 --> 00:44:56,358
[SPEAKER_07]: No word on when that's coming out, but sometime this year.

642
00:44:58,039 --> 00:44:58,179
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

643
00:44:59,215 --> 00:45:03,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Super Mario Bros.

644
00:45:03,596 --> 00:45:06,517
[SPEAKER_07]: 2 is now coming this August.

645
00:45:07,018 --> 00:45:08,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Both Japan and the US.

646
00:45:09,338 --> 00:45:11,859
[SPEAKER_07]: And looks exactly like New Super Mario Bros.

647
00:45:12,279 --> 00:45:11,859
1.

648
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,820
[SPEAKER_07]: But with now Raccoon Mario.

649
00:45:17,341 --> 00:45:17,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Hooray.

650
00:45:17,921 --> 00:45:18,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Raccoon's awesome.

651
00:45:18,981 --> 00:45:20,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Raccoon or Tanooki?

652
00:45:20,902 --> 00:45:21,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Raccoon.

653
00:45:21,242 --> 00:45:21,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Raccoon.

654
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:22,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

655
00:45:22,563 --> 00:45:23,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe Tanooki.

656
00:45:23,183 --> 00:45:23,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?

657
00:45:23,383 --> 00:45:24,923
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought the Tanooki suit was the most awesome.

658
00:45:24,983 --> 00:45:26,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, my favorite was the Hammer Bros.

659
00:45:26,364 --> 00:45:26,524
[SPEAKER_02]: suit.

660
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:34,002
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just glad, though, that they have stuck with the same backgrounds from the first game so that, you know, Josh's room is still current.

661
00:45:36,302 --> 00:45:40,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, actually, that looks like Josh's room, except different patterns in the mountains.

662
00:45:40,592 --> 00:45:58,354
[SPEAKER_08]: is it sad that it seriously took me a minute because my first reaction when they announced the sequel was I was like holy shit already we just had Mario 3D Land last year and then I was like oh wait it's not a sequel to the 3D game this is a sequel on the 3DS to the Wii game

663
00:45:59,455 --> 00:46:01,157
[SPEAKER_08]: My brain actually had to go through those motions.

664
00:46:01,217 --> 00:46:04,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually to the DS game that was on the DS.

665
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:05,883
[SPEAKER_08]: What the hell was the Wii game then?

666
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:07,966
[SPEAKER_07]: The Wii game was kind of the same damn thing.

667
00:46:08,106 --> 00:46:09,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Just New Super Mario Bros.

668
00:46:09,187 --> 00:46:09,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Wii.

669
00:46:09,788 --> 00:46:10,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Notice the Wii at the end.

670
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:15,094
[SPEAKER_02]: That was actually the first game that made Dan think about getting a 3DS.

671
00:46:15,535 --> 00:46:16,075
[SPEAKER_08]: Confirmed.

672
00:46:16,115 --> 00:46:17,117
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't understand Nintendo.

673
00:46:18,277 --> 00:46:21,722
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, all you have to understand is they took the game and they made some new levels.

674
00:46:22,683 --> 00:46:28,330
[SPEAKER_07]: And made some blinged out characters because there's a level with all gold characters for some reason.

675
00:46:29,432 --> 00:46:30,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and spider webs.

676
00:46:30,794 --> 00:46:31,415
[SPEAKER_07]: That must be new.

677
00:46:31,775 --> 00:46:31,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?

678
00:46:32,877 --> 00:46:33,177
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

679
00:46:33,938 --> 00:47:02,818
[SPEAKER_08]: by the way I want to point out Alan has paraded out here just to hand me to do nothing but he hasn't even been sitting here he's been sitting in the back room playing Mass Effect he walked out here specifically just to hand me the DS cartridge of New Super Mario Brothers as if to say here dumbass thank you honey thank you thank you I learned so much being with you I'm putting this up on our on our page

680
00:47:03,934 --> 00:47:04,815
[SPEAKER_07]: New Super Mario Bros.

681
00:47:05,135 --> 00:47:07,057
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of weird that it's coming out in August.

682
00:47:08,379 --> 00:47:12,683
[SPEAKER_07]: So that means that Nintendo does have something else that they're going to be releasing for the fourth quarter.

683
00:47:12,863 --> 00:47:13,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I know!

684
00:47:13,324 --> 00:47:14,145
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a new console!

685
00:47:14,185 --> 00:47:14,685
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it!

686
00:47:14,766 --> 00:47:15,907
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what they're releasing.

687
00:47:16,528 --> 00:47:20,332
[SPEAKER_07]: That and probably Animal Crossing because Animal Crossing is somewhat cracky.

688
00:47:21,113 --> 00:47:21,433
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

689
00:47:22,579 --> 00:47:29,402
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, anyways, as I was alluding to earlier, I believe that the Wii Mario game that we're going to be putting out is going to be New Super Mario Bros.

690
00:47:30,543 --> 00:47:44,389
[SPEAKER_07]: 2 for the Wii U. And that you're going to be able to integrate, or not integrate, but play the game on your 3DS and on your console because the 3DS, they will probably announce, will actually be able to link up with your Wii U to...

691
00:47:45,973 --> 00:47:46,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

692
00:48:04,372 --> 00:48:08,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Except the new 3DS that they probably will announce that will have two analog sticks and not just one.

693
00:48:09,757 --> 00:48:11,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hope and no attachment later on, please.

694
00:48:12,779 --> 00:48:13,920
[SPEAKER_08]: That would kind of piss me off.

695
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially if it's exclusive to GameStop.

696
00:48:15,542 --> 00:48:16,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Quickie poll.

697
00:48:16,683 --> 00:48:16,863
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

698
00:48:17,183 --> 00:48:18,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Kuriboh's shoe or Hammer Brothers suit?

699
00:48:19,205 --> 00:48:20,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Kuriboh's shoe all the way.

700
00:48:21,006 --> 00:48:22,608
[SPEAKER_08]: That was like the raddest power-up ever.

701
00:48:22,848 --> 00:48:24,129
[SPEAKER_07]: The Hammer Brothers suit sucks.

702
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:26,070
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Frog Mario.

703
00:48:26,231 --> 00:48:27,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, Frog Mario sucks too.

704
00:48:27,572 --> 00:48:27,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Frog Mario sucks.

705
00:48:27,892 --> 00:48:30,454
[SPEAKER_08]: FrogMario is balls unless you're in an underwater level.

706
00:48:30,855 --> 00:48:32,136
[SPEAKER_08]: I will say that it is a challenge.

707
00:48:32,817 --> 00:48:37,862
[SPEAKER_08]: If somebody can beat the game with FrogMario through the level 8 worlds, color me impressed.

708
00:48:37,982 --> 00:48:41,285
[SPEAKER_02]: FrogMario actually is very good in one of the level 8 ones, the battleships.

709
00:48:42,446 --> 00:48:42,947
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

710
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:03,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Why hasn't that made it into Mario Kart as a power-up?

711
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:05,952
[SPEAKER_07]: Just a big shoe that stomps on enemies?

712
00:49:05,972 --> 00:49:06,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.

713
00:49:06,712 --> 00:49:08,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like your cart turns into the shoe.

714
00:49:08,894 --> 00:49:10,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah, your cart.

715
00:49:10,696 --> 00:49:11,637
[SPEAKER_08]: That's an awesome power-up.

716
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:17,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Your cart turns into the shoe, and it just flies ahead and stomps on whoever's in front of you, and you just take off from there.

717
00:49:17,803 --> 00:49:18,844
[SPEAKER_08]: That's awesome.

718
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:19,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my God.

719
00:49:19,685 --> 00:49:20,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Nintendo.

720
00:49:20,485 --> 00:49:21,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Patent pending.

721
00:49:21,366 --> 00:49:21,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't do it.

722
00:49:22,347 --> 00:49:23,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo, hire us.

723
00:49:23,468 --> 00:49:23,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Hire us.

724
00:49:23,949 --> 00:49:24,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Hire us.

725
00:49:24,349 --> 00:49:24,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Hire us.

726
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:25,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Hire us.

727
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:29,132
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be a cool idea.

728
00:49:29,153 --> 00:49:31,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Confirm next week OLR on the Nintendo Network.

729
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:32,223
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

730
00:49:32,724 --> 00:49:32,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Kidding.

731
00:49:33,386 --> 00:49:34,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Put the hate mail down.

732
00:49:36,701 --> 00:49:42,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and then last thing, the 3DS is finally getting with iOS and everybody else.

733
00:49:42,363 --> 00:49:47,065
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, hey, they've figured out, you know, you might like to sort your icons that you have.

734
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:55,167
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're going to have a new addition to the home menu where you can create folders and store up to 60 icons within each folder.

735
00:49:55,287 --> 00:49:57,368
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is awesome.

736
00:49:57,388 --> 00:50:00,369
[SPEAKER_07]: You can actually kind of sort your games and whatnot.

737
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:02,610
[SPEAKER_07]: Neat.

738
00:50:03,111 --> 00:50:03,812
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that idea.

739
00:50:04,212 --> 00:50:04,693
[SPEAKER_07]: It's needed.

740
00:50:04,893 --> 00:50:06,235
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll become an April 25th.

741
00:50:06,815 --> 00:50:08,297
[SPEAKER_08]: The Things I Don't Play folder.

742
00:50:08,938 --> 00:50:14,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's have that for all the little NES games and the Game Boy Advance games I downloaded because they were free and I don't play them.

743
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:16,626
[SPEAKER_08]: There are some I do play, but some I don't.

744
00:50:18,048 --> 00:50:18,168
[SPEAKER_08]: So.

745
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:23,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, let's move on with some more news.

746
00:50:23,107 --> 00:50:33,242
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, there's a lot of great Nintendo happy-go-lucky news this week, but somebody's not so happy-go-lucky about what's going on in Nintendo, and that would be Trent Oster.

747
00:50:34,144 --> 00:50:34,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Who is he?

748
00:50:34,724 --> 00:50:35,805
[SPEAKER_08]: He's with BeamDog.

749
00:50:35,845 --> 00:50:39,588
[SPEAKER_08]: And he went to Twitter this week to say, Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition?

750
00:50:40,249 --> 00:50:47,695
[SPEAKER_08]: Not coming to the Wii U. Ironically, I never would have thought that game was coming to the Wii U. Yeah, I'm like, I never would have put it.

751
00:50:47,755 --> 00:50:54,220
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, for whatever reason, he was asked, and he said, We don't do Nintendo development.

752
00:50:54,860 --> 00:51:00,745
[SPEAKER_08]: Previous experience with Nintendo was enough to ensure there will not be another Nintendo project.

753
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:02,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no, he didn't.

754
00:51:04,328 --> 00:51:08,470
[SPEAKER_08]: He just basically said, worked with Nintendo before, not going to happen again.

755
00:51:08,810 --> 00:51:10,971
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently it has to do with MDK2.

756
00:51:11,051 --> 00:51:12,972
[SPEAKER_08]: You remember MDK from back in the day?

757
00:51:12,992 --> 00:51:13,813
[SPEAKER_08]: There was MDK2.

758
00:51:14,153 --> 00:51:15,314
[SPEAKER_08]: It was supposed to be WiiWare.

759
00:51:15,654 --> 00:51:20,376
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a 6,000 unit sales requirement before the developer gets payment.

760
00:51:22,017 --> 00:51:23,458
[SPEAKER_08]: I can see where that's kind of crappy.

761
00:51:23,778 --> 00:51:28,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Also had to do with trying to get a 400 meg game down to 40 megs with WiiWare, you know.

762
00:51:29,035 --> 00:51:33,219
[SPEAKER_08]: I can see where, you know, if you don't like the rules, then I'm going to take my ball and go somewhere else.

763
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:33,880
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fine.

764
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:46,752
[SPEAKER_07]: They honestly need to, like, you know, rethink their whole strategy with their online games because they are a little bit restrictive and, you know, the exposure on WiiWare isn't very good.

765
00:51:47,472 --> 00:51:54,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this whole Nintendo Direct before E3 is very interesting to me, because E3 is only, what, about six weeks away at this point?

766
00:51:55,255 --> 00:52:03,998
[SPEAKER_08]: And for Nintendo to have this kind of a major press conference before E3 is very interesting, because these are games they very easily could have kept in their hat until E3, with the exception of the firmware update.

767
00:52:04,358 --> 00:52:05,919
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really the only thing that's happening now.

768
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,361
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

769
00:52:29,139 --> 00:52:29,900
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

770
00:52:43,257 --> 00:52:44,358
[SPEAKER_08]: Zelda in 2013, maybe

771
00:53:03,677 --> 00:53:23,236
[SPEAKER_08]: well also one thing I wanted to say is that one thing that Nintendo didn't detail here that they're going to have to detail at E3 is the Nintendo Network we still don't really know I mean we've heard some little things about it we don't really know what that entails and I think E3 is going to be a big reveal for that and they don't know either I wouldn't put it past them

772
00:53:25,922 --> 00:53:29,204
[SPEAKER_07]: So hey guys, we have this poll on our website.

773
00:53:29,644 --> 00:53:33,347
[SPEAKER_07]: We want you to vote on what exactly you want the Nintendo Network to be.

774
00:53:34,107 --> 00:53:35,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Breakman in chat makes a pretty good point.

775
00:53:35,808 --> 00:53:40,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Spoiler alert, Gears of War 4 also not going to be on the Wii U. Sorry everyone.

776
00:53:43,652 --> 00:53:48,513
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true, and you probably won't see God of War coming to the Wii U anytime soon either.

777
00:53:48,853 --> 00:53:49,913
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just the way these things work.

778
00:53:50,873 --> 00:54:00,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Halo 4, not on the Wii U. That's right, not on the Wii U. Not on the Wii U. Until there's... Someday, one of them's going to gobble the other up.

779
00:54:00,635 --> 00:54:01,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Just wait.

780
00:54:01,735 --> 00:54:02,535
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like Sega.

781
00:54:02,855 --> 00:54:05,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Who would have thought Sega would be publishing on a Nintendo platform?

782
00:54:05,656 --> 00:54:06,216
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

783
00:54:07,156 --> 00:54:10,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Minds were blown when Sonic showed up on the NES system.

784
00:54:10,457 --> 00:54:11,197
[SPEAKER_08]: It was crazy.

785
00:54:11,986 --> 00:54:12,366
[SPEAKER_02]: I cried.

786
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:13,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Aww.

787
00:54:14,307 --> 00:54:14,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

788
00:54:15,548 --> 00:54:16,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, moving on.

789
00:54:16,708 --> 00:54:17,188
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.

790
00:54:17,449 --> 00:54:20,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Final Fantasy XIV, they're desperate.

791
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:25,472
[SPEAKER_02]: They really, really, really, really want everyone to come back.

792
00:54:26,292 --> 00:54:27,493
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just crying over it.

793
00:54:28,533 --> 00:54:35,897
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, anyone who has an inactive Final Fantasy XIV account can come back for a 10-day free trial next month, according to Squeenix.

794
00:54:37,918 --> 00:54:50,464
[SPEAKER_02]: I said it's going to be free of charge between the 10th and 21st of May with a new job system, 7th Umbral Era content and new gameplay that has a new update.

795
00:54:52,865 --> 00:54:56,267
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for the people that are still playing, they're getting some goodies.

796
00:54:56,347 --> 00:55:15,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone who's been subscribed for 90 days between January 6th and the 2.0 beta testing gets their subscription released to, well, this is in pounds because I'm reading off a British article, to £6.89 down from £8.99.

797
00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:19,320
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are legacy subscribers and they get a new Chocobo.

798
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:19,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh.

799
00:55:20,421 --> 00:55:20,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh.

800
00:55:23,067 --> 00:55:26,589
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're also still cutting down on their servers, so they're desperate.

801
00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:28,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Desperate!

802
00:55:29,111 --> 00:55:33,874
[SPEAKER_07]: The problem is, though, who cares that they're offering a free comeback and try us for 10 days?

803
00:55:34,074 --> 00:55:35,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's not the 2.0 update yet!

804
00:55:35,815 --> 00:55:37,176
[SPEAKER_07]: That doesn't happen until the fall!

805
00:55:37,396 --> 00:55:39,477
[SPEAKER_07]: So why do I want to play your half-finished game?

806
00:55:39,617 --> 00:55:45,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, to be fair, I mean, I give Final Fantasy XIV its fair share of shit.

807
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:46,001
[SPEAKER_08]: I did play it.

808
00:55:46,262 --> 00:55:47,903
[SPEAKER_08]: I did play it for a while, so I can speak.

809
00:55:49,183 --> 00:55:51,865
[SPEAKER_08]: as a former player, as someone who would be directly impacted by this.

810
00:55:52,745 --> 00:56:01,270
[SPEAKER_08]: They have put some things into the game already that were needed, and that was Final Fantasy classes that people understand, to put it lightly.

811
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:11,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Like now instead of Thaumaturge and Conjurer, you can path to Black Mage and White Mage, and some of those changes are actually pretty exciting.

812
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:12,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Not enough to get me back.

813
00:56:13,856 --> 00:56:14,616
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I should say...

814
00:56:15,777 --> 00:56:20,838
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, if it's going to be free for 10 days, if I'm not... What weekend is this happening again?

815
00:56:21,078 --> 00:56:22,559
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of shut my brain off for a minute.

816
00:56:22,919 --> 00:56:23,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Crap.

817
00:56:23,319 --> 00:56:24,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me look back at it.

818
00:56:24,759 --> 00:56:29,460
[SPEAKER_02]: It says it is the 10th and 21st of May.

819
00:56:30,301 --> 00:56:31,241
[SPEAKER_08]: See, here's the problem.

820
00:56:32,441 --> 00:56:33,782
[SPEAKER_08]: What's happening on the 15th of May?

821
00:56:34,842 --> 00:56:35,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Disneyland?

822
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:37,002
[SPEAKER_08]: For you.

823
00:56:37,062 --> 00:56:38,943
[SPEAKER_08]: What's happening on the 15th of May for everybody else?

824
00:56:39,949 --> 00:56:40,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Max Payne 3.

825
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:42,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Diablo 3, people.

826
00:56:43,432 --> 00:56:45,413
[SPEAKER_08]: Diablo 3 is on May 15th.

827
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:50,236
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think I give a shit about Final Fantasy 14 while I'm in the middle of Diablo 3?

828
00:56:50,276 --> 00:56:53,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Why does this make me think of Cabela's and the Halo 3 launch?

829
00:56:54,039 --> 00:56:55,140
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's be real.

830
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:58,362
[SPEAKER_08]: There's really a four-day window to play Final Fantasy 14.

831
00:56:58,642 --> 00:56:59,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Just keeping it real, folks.

832
00:57:01,324 --> 00:57:04,506
[SPEAKER_08]: And so maybe if it's not because, you know...

833
00:57:05,527 --> 00:57:11,692
[SPEAKER_08]: If the patch is 7 gigs, I have to think about, oh, I have a 250 gig through Comcast, and I gotta download Diablo.

834
00:57:11,952 --> 00:57:13,774
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate that I have to fucking think about that, but I do.

835
00:57:14,434 --> 00:57:17,517
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, if it's reasonable, I'll check it out.

836
00:57:17,857 --> 00:57:18,197
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?

837
00:57:18,738 --> 00:57:19,258
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's free.

838
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:22,741
[SPEAKER_08]: But I kind of don't think it's gonna sway my opinion.

839
00:57:23,789 --> 00:57:27,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Porkchop in our chatroom asks, does Final Fantasy XIV have much of a soundtrack?

840
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:28,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's decent.

841
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:36,272
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe Nobuo Imatsu did a large chunk of the tracks, which is strange because he didn't really do XI's soundtrack at all except the theme.

842
00:57:36,412 --> 00:57:37,552
[SPEAKER_07]: Just bring XI free-to-play.

843
00:57:37,953 --> 00:57:39,033
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all you need to do.

844
00:57:39,473 --> 00:57:39,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?

845
00:57:40,213 --> 00:57:42,194
[SPEAKER_07]: All you need is XI free-to-play, I'd be there.

846
00:57:42,574 --> 00:57:43,854
[SPEAKER_08]: I would be there today.

847
00:57:43,934 --> 00:57:45,535
[SPEAKER_08]: You know why XI can't go free-to-play?

848
00:57:46,295 --> 00:57:47,975
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the Japanese user base on PlayStation 2.

849
00:57:48,575 --> 00:57:50,896
[SPEAKER_08]: How can you have a free-to-play game on the PlayStation 2 at this point?

850
00:57:51,676 --> 00:57:52,036
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't.

851
00:57:52,096 --> 00:57:52,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Cut him out.

852
00:57:54,317 --> 00:57:54,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

853
00:57:55,437 --> 00:57:56,217
[SPEAKER_07]: No, seriously.

854
00:57:56,317 --> 00:57:57,397
[SPEAKER_07]: How long is the PlayStation?

855
00:57:57,497 --> 00:57:58,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, fine.

856
00:57:58,358 --> 00:58:01,238
[SPEAKER_07]: The PlayStation 2 still has some game coming out.

857
00:58:01,258 --> 00:58:04,719
[SPEAKER_08]: To be fair, there's like five people on Xbox 360 too.

858
00:58:04,779 --> 00:58:05,599
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's not forget that.

859
00:58:05,639 --> 00:58:06,500
[SPEAKER_08]: That was a pretty big deal.

860
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:07,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

861
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:11,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's keep them up for the five people that play on Xbox 360.

862
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:14,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, but all those people that play EA Sports MMA, fuck them.

863
00:58:14,601 --> 00:58:16,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Or Need for Speed, ah, fuck them too.

864
00:58:16,702 --> 00:58:17,282
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

865
00:58:17,362 --> 00:58:20,843
[SPEAKER_07]: All those five people that are playing Final Fantasy, who gives a shit?

866
00:58:21,383 --> 00:58:21,883
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

867
00:58:21,923 --> 00:58:25,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell them, listen, go download the PC client for free because it's free to fucking play!

868
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,087
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

869
00:58:27,147 --> 00:58:28,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people, though, do like that.

870
00:58:28,488 --> 00:58:31,070
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like, we have Ikuma right now saying that it's good now.

871
00:58:32,431 --> 00:58:37,354
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, okay, if you have a PlayStation 2 and you're still playing on that game, get a new PC!

872
00:58:37,594 --> 00:58:43,758
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, come on, a PC from, like, a few years... Shit, you could probably get a PC from, like... What is it?

873
00:58:43,878 --> 00:58:46,320
[SPEAKER_07]: How long has it been since I've been playing Final Fantasy XI?

874
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:47,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, ten years?

875
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:47,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Ten years?

876
00:58:48,755 --> 00:58:49,135
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a while.

877
00:58:49,355 --> 00:58:50,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, come on.

878
00:58:50,376 --> 00:59:00,220
[SPEAKER_08]: If you can't afford a PC from like 10 years ago, what the... It hasn't been 10 years because the show is 10 years old and the Final Fantasy XI thing started.

879
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:00,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, fine.

880
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:01,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Like a couple years ago.

881
00:59:01,481 --> 00:59:03,362
[SPEAKER_07]: Five to seven years ago, okay?

882
00:59:03,862 --> 00:59:04,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Five to seven years ago.

883
00:59:04,822 --> 00:59:07,744
[SPEAKER_07]: I literally am throwing away computers from that time.

884
00:59:07,984 --> 00:59:10,145
[SPEAKER_07]: I will give you a computer for free.

885
00:59:10,405 --> 00:59:13,006
[SPEAKER_08]: The computer that the show is broadcast from could play Final Fantasy XI.

886
00:59:13,066 --> 00:59:14,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I mean, fuck.

887
00:59:14,487 --> 00:59:16,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably this Vita could play Final Fantasy XI.

888
00:59:16,668 --> 00:59:17,248
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a rumor.

889
00:59:17,768 --> 00:59:18,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember?

890
00:59:18,370 --> 00:59:18,951
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a rumor.

891
00:59:18,971 --> 00:59:20,054
[SPEAKER_07]: They really knew to do that.

892
00:59:20,074 --> 00:59:20,555
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a rumor.

893
00:59:20,655 --> 00:59:21,357
[SPEAKER_07]: I would buy that.

894
00:59:21,698 --> 00:59:22,640
[SPEAKER_07]: I would buy that shit.

895
00:59:22,821 --> 00:59:23,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, maybe not on the Vita, because I mean...

896
00:59:24,969 --> 00:59:25,889
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'd still buy that.

897
00:59:26,249 --> 00:59:28,390
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm telling you, Final Fantasy XI would be awesome.

898
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:29,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Who cares about XIV?

899
00:59:29,391 --> 00:59:29,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Just listen.

900
00:59:29,971 --> 00:59:30,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, it didn't work out.

901
00:59:31,131 --> 00:59:32,432
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to make it free to play.

902
00:59:33,072 --> 00:59:37,854
[SPEAKER_07]: To make it up, we're going to maybe revamp a little bit of Final Fantasy XI and make it free to play.

903
00:59:37,874 --> 00:59:50,838
[SPEAKER_08]: There is too much pride for Square Enix, the makers of Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy to say, we're going to open this up free to play and have to take that big old slice of humble pie.

904
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:52,599
[SPEAKER_08]: It ain't happening anytime soon.

905
00:59:55,126 --> 00:59:55,726
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll wait.

906
00:59:56,087 --> 00:59:59,069
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing for your MMO to take that path.

907
00:59:59,369 --> 01:00:01,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Why can't Final Fantasy go down the path of Guild Wars?

908
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:02,771
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, forget it.

909
01:00:03,371 --> 01:00:04,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're Squeenix.

910
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:05,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on.

911
01:00:05,533 --> 01:00:06,253
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't do that.

912
01:00:06,573 --> 01:00:12,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's talk about games that are really existing in a store near you very soon as we travel around the world and look at some release dates.

913
01:00:12,877 --> 01:00:13,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay!

914
01:00:15,256 --> 01:00:26,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so this week it's Prototype 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and on 360, Phantom Breaker Special Edition.

915
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:30,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Shinsengoku Musou Versus

916
01:00:57,197 --> 01:00:58,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Vita, Seal No Surge, Ushinarwatiya

917
01:01:16,852 --> 01:01:28,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Wareta, sorry, Hoshi i Sasagushi comes out this week in normal and agent packs, as well as Next Revolution comes out for Media 5 this week.

918
01:01:28,956 --> 01:01:30,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are both on the Vita.

919
01:01:31,416 --> 01:01:37,498
[SPEAKER_08]: And checking out the consoles real quick, going to the PlayStation 3, Biohazard, Operation Raccoon City.

920
01:01:37,818 --> 01:01:42,700
[SPEAKER_08]: You get a special headset bundle for Operation Raccoon City, the game itself.

921
01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:43,720
[SPEAKER_08]: It's coming out.

922
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,421
[SPEAKER_02]: And Loki's saying, don't fall for it, it sucks.

923
01:01:47,248 --> 01:01:53,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, what's very interesting, Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, Game of the Year Edition, finally coming out on PlayStation 3.

924
01:01:55,031 --> 01:01:58,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Fallout 3, Game of the Year Edition, finally coming out on PlayStation 3.

925
01:01:58,192 --> 01:01:59,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that a new Idolmaster?

926
01:01:59,252 --> 01:02:00,573
[SPEAKER_08]: I think those are price reductions.

927
01:02:01,133 --> 01:02:05,315
[SPEAKER_08]: And yes, the Idolmaster Graveur for You, Volume 7.

928
01:02:05,355 --> 01:02:07,095
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this is more an expansion for Idolmaster.

929
01:02:07,115 --> 01:02:08,896
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's like an actual full...

930
01:02:09,576 --> 01:02:18,721
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm guessing that those are getting a price reduction because there was just recently a combo pack with Fallout 3 and Oblivion for like $29.99 or something.

931
01:02:19,201 --> 01:02:20,262
[SPEAKER_08]: That could be here in the States?

932
01:02:20,422 --> 01:02:20,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

933
01:02:20,742 --> 01:02:21,142
[SPEAKER_07]: That could be.

934
01:02:21,322 --> 01:02:23,544
[SPEAKER_07]: That was on 360, but I can see them dropping prices.

935
01:02:24,124 --> 01:02:26,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Oddly enough, 360 is pretty busy this week in Japan.

936
01:02:27,085 --> 01:02:29,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Operation Raccoon City Biohazard is out there as well.

937
01:02:29,547 --> 01:02:29,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Sucks.

938
01:02:30,147 --> 01:02:33,469
[SPEAKER_08]: Cybertroopers Virtual On Force gets the Platinum reduction.

939
01:02:33,529 --> 01:02:34,209
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know, right?

940
01:02:34,509 --> 01:02:35,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knew Virtual On was still going?

941
01:02:36,112 --> 01:02:42,476
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's the arcade game plus they're throwing in the tournament stick or that arcade stick that goes with it.

942
01:02:42,636 --> 01:02:43,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Need.

943
01:02:43,236 --> 01:02:47,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Dodonpachi Resurrection Black Label and it's a cave game is out this week.

944
01:02:47,479 --> 01:02:48,319
[SPEAKER_07]: That's probably a price reduction.

945
01:02:48,339 --> 01:02:49,380
[SPEAKER_08]: There's going to be a double pack.

946
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because it's called Cave Selection.

947
01:02:52,141 --> 01:02:54,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Fallout 3 Game of the Year Edition also on the Xbox 360.

948
01:02:55,243 --> 01:02:56,184
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Dodonpachi.

949
01:02:56,404 --> 01:02:59,206
[SPEAKER_02]: The Dodonpachi Resurrection came out like what, six months ago?

950
01:02:59,226 --> 01:02:59,626
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

951
01:03:00,137 --> 01:03:02,739
[SPEAKER_07]: You saw that Akai Katana is coming out next month.

952
01:03:03,299 --> 01:03:03,900
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I missed that.

953
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,321
[SPEAKER_07]: The new shmup.

954
01:03:05,341 --> 01:03:07,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's a new shmup.

955
01:03:07,362 --> 01:03:09,703
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually one that's actually formatted for widescreen.

956
01:03:10,284 --> 01:03:14,287
[SPEAKER_07]: The first cave game for widescreen, HD TVs, all done in HD.

957
01:03:14,407 --> 01:03:15,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Well done.

958
01:03:15,808 --> 01:03:16,368
[SPEAKER_07]: About time.

959
01:03:16,668 --> 01:03:17,629
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's coming out in the States.

960
01:03:20,110 --> 01:03:20,611
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

961
01:03:20,991 --> 01:03:23,172
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually a game that's in talks with Square.

962
01:03:23,192 --> 01:03:29,837
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if we have it in anything in the show, but actually one thing I am interested that's coming out, hopefully, that Square is doing is a sequel to The World Ends With You.

963
01:03:30,959 --> 01:03:32,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I heard about that.

964
01:03:32,766 --> 01:03:33,529
[SPEAKER_02]: They're supposed to be doing that.

965
01:03:33,971 --> 01:03:34,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Good times.

966
01:03:35,115 --> 01:03:35,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Comes out December.

967
01:03:38,306 --> 01:03:38,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, really?

968
01:03:39,487 --> 01:03:41,867
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm just saying, wouldn't that be funny because of the Mayan calendar?

969
01:03:41,887 --> 01:03:45,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I thought that was one of your little, like, Loki tips slipping in there.

970
01:03:46,089 --> 01:03:51,791
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just funny because I don't think that our December on the Gregorian calendar would have been the end of their year.

971
01:03:53,292 --> 01:03:54,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, a little bit of trivia.

972
01:03:54,833 --> 01:03:57,974
[SPEAKER_02]: On the lunar calendar for the Jewish calendar, we actually don't have a leap year.

973
01:03:57,994 --> 01:04:00,935
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a leap month every, I think, 13 years.

974
01:04:01,635 --> 01:04:02,235
[SPEAKER_02]: So, just saying.

975
01:04:03,036 --> 01:04:03,816
[SPEAKER_08]: I want a whole month.

976
01:04:03,896 --> 01:04:04,936
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a whole extra month.

977
01:04:04,956 --> 01:04:06,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have to work in that month?

978
01:04:06,517 --> 01:04:06,677
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

979
01:04:07,118 --> 01:04:07,739
[SPEAKER_08]: Good times.

980
01:04:07,759 --> 01:04:09,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, it's normal stuff.

981
01:04:09,701 --> 01:04:10,883
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't work on Shabbat.

982
01:04:10,943 --> 01:04:13,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Who would run the world then if we didn't work for a whole month?

983
01:04:15,289 --> 01:04:17,612
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the Jew... Anarchy!

984
01:04:19,174 --> 01:04:19,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on, UK...

985
01:04:21,127 --> 01:04:36,933
[SPEAKER_02]: 24th of April we have FIFA 12, UFA Euro 12 The Walking Dead and Prototype 2 there's a game that actually came out on my birthday that I think has a funny name and I have no idea what it's about but it makes me think of Benicula as Botanicula

986
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:41,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if anyone ever remembers a book about the vegetarian vampire rabbit.

987
01:04:43,152 --> 01:04:46,153
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 26th of April is Deus Ex Human Revolution.

988
01:04:46,593 --> 01:04:51,055
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 27th, Binary Domain, Blazing Souls, Accolade, or is it Accelate?

989
01:04:51,515 --> 01:04:51,815
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

990
01:04:52,635 --> 01:04:55,356
[SPEAKER_02]: And Risen 2, Dark Waters.

991
01:04:57,217 --> 01:04:57,737
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be it.

992
01:04:59,778 --> 01:05:00,218
[SPEAKER_02]: The Saw.

993
01:05:01,636 --> 01:05:08,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so I don't know if I should be happy about this, but I guess a company doing well, great.

994
01:05:09,242 --> 01:05:13,745
[SPEAKER_07]: THQ, their forecast for their earnings has improved.

995
01:05:14,786 --> 01:05:18,689
[SPEAKER_07]: They're saying that now they're reporting a net sales from $160 million to $170 million.

996
01:05:22,298 --> 01:05:27,082
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course the previous update was from 130 to 150.

997
01:05:28,383 --> 01:05:30,764
[SPEAKER_07]: So what can this be attributed to?

998
01:05:31,165 --> 01:05:38,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's due to the fact that people have been dumb enough to buy the fucking DLC for Saints Row the Third.

999
01:05:39,411 --> 01:05:42,473
[SPEAKER_07]: And I am proud to say that I am not one of those people.

1000
01:05:42,733 --> 01:05:49,018
[SPEAKER_07]: I made the mistake once purchasing one of their content packs or expansions, whatever you want to call it.

1001
01:05:50,481 --> 01:05:51,281
[SPEAKER_07]: And it sucked.

1002
01:05:51,801 --> 01:05:53,522
[SPEAKER_07]: It was 30 minutes of content for $8.

1003
01:05:55,122 --> 01:05:55,483
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, $7.

1004
01:05:55,523 --> 01:05:59,804
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just said fuck it.

1005
01:05:59,824 --> 01:06:00,764
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cheaper than a hooker.

1006
01:06:03,245 --> 01:06:05,466
[SPEAKER_07]: 30 minutes, yeah, that is cheaper than a hooker.

1007
01:06:06,046 --> 01:06:08,407
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's definitely not as satisfying.

1008
01:06:08,447 --> 01:06:09,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Not as much payoff.

1009
01:06:11,027 --> 01:06:12,388
[SPEAKER_07]: When did you start pricing hookers?

1010
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:15,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get me started.

1011
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:16,951
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there something for your birthday I didn't hear about?

1012
01:06:17,391 --> 01:06:20,413
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I actually... Nothing.

1013
01:06:20,753 --> 01:06:23,254
[SPEAKER_02]: This comes from the episode last week's Supernatural.

1014
01:06:24,115 --> 01:06:24,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course.

1015
01:06:24,595 --> 01:06:25,616
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a fancy lady.

1016
01:06:25,776 --> 01:06:26,436
[SPEAKER_02]: What, a hooker?

1017
01:06:27,577 --> 01:06:28,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Dot, dot, dot.

1018
01:06:28,037 --> 01:06:29,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, come on.

1019
01:06:29,798 --> 01:06:33,381
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to know that you have to factor in the HMV into everything.

1020
01:06:33,421 --> 01:06:37,323
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, everything's based off the HME, which is the hooker market value.

1021
01:06:37,683 --> 01:06:42,986
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you don't know what the hooker market value is, how are you going to know how to price your other goods that are based off the HMV?

1022
01:06:44,287 --> 01:06:47,009
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm telling you, this is just street smarts.

1023
01:06:47,089 --> 01:06:47,809
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, seriously.

1024
01:06:48,829 --> 01:06:54,492
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yes, it's really unfortunate that people were dumb enough to buy this.

1025
01:06:54,733 --> 01:06:57,094
[SPEAKER_07]: And most of which was paid unlocked content, by the way.

1026
01:06:57,494 --> 01:07:01,696
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, they're still putting out little costumes and bullshit that was in the game.

1027
01:07:03,557 --> 01:07:06,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Sadly, though, if they put out a sequel to this game, I'm probably not going to have to buy it.

1028
01:07:06,919 --> 01:07:08,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I do remember earlier...

1029
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:32,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, well, a couple weeks ago while we were out, or while I was out, a certain idiot from, um, I'm not really sure if he works for THQ or Volition, I believe he works for THQ, was complaining about, you know, I'm not getting enough money from use games, and so, of course, he had to be the first person to enter my list of, hey, I'm

1030
01:07:32,578 --> 01:07:38,000
[SPEAKER_07]: If you complain about used game sales and not making anything off of it, I'm going to boycott your game.

1031
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:49,523
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Richard Brown, the first inductee into that list, who had worked on many things, including Saints Row III, unfortunately, I am now going to have to be forced not to purchase any more games.

1032
01:07:49,683 --> 01:07:51,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you seriously boycotting Saints Row IV?

1033
01:07:51,504 --> 01:07:52,084
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't believe it.

1034
01:07:52,204 --> 01:07:53,105
[SPEAKER_08]: I do not believe it.

1035
01:07:53,365 --> 01:07:54,205
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not buying the game new.

1036
01:07:56,506 --> 01:07:57,806
[SPEAKER_07]: They will not get any of my new money.

1037
01:07:58,466 --> 01:08:00,927
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll wait until that first trailer is out and I'll ask you again.

1038
01:08:02,501 --> 01:08:10,686
[SPEAKER_07]: But yes, he has worked on many games, including Homefront, Ren Faction, Armageddon, Saints for the Third, Stacking, Warhammer 40k, WWE All-Stars.

1039
01:08:10,726 --> 01:08:14,148
[SPEAKER_07]: He's basically, I think he's like a producer or something like that over at THQ.

1040
01:08:14,648 --> 01:08:17,790
[SPEAKER_07]: He backs the money for this stuff.

1041
01:08:19,611 --> 01:08:28,696
[SPEAKER_07]: So yes, and of course he came out bitching about how, you know, oh, they need used game sales because all these excuses.

1042
01:08:29,516 --> 01:08:29,857
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1043
01:08:29,937 --> 01:08:32,058
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even really want to go into detail about it, but...

1044
01:08:34,582 --> 01:08:35,662
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, it's annoying.

1045
01:08:36,443 --> 01:08:40,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, he talked about the real cost of used games and smuggle bastard.

1046
01:08:41,884 --> 01:08:42,884
[SPEAKER_08]: Blah, blah, blah.

1047
01:08:43,024 --> 01:08:43,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Blah, blah, blah.

1048
01:08:43,945 --> 01:08:44,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Who cares?

1049
01:08:45,585 --> 01:08:52,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, everybody has Kickstarter fever in the States anyway because, you know, they don't really have anything like it overseas.

1050
01:08:52,567 --> 01:08:54,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, by the way, I got to say this.

1051
01:08:54,428 --> 01:08:58,409
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a great Penny Arcade article on Kickstarter this week about how

1052
01:08:58,869 --> 01:08:59,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1053
01:09:27,779 --> 01:09:30,181
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there is a little bit of the financial end.

1054
01:09:30,201 --> 01:09:33,843
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to have people that manage your money, your marketing, and all that stuff.

1055
01:09:33,863 --> 01:09:36,124
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't just go make game, make money.

1056
01:09:36,204 --> 01:09:38,625
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's a little bit more complex than that.

1057
01:09:39,926 --> 01:09:40,166
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1058
01:09:41,287 --> 01:09:43,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a quick note for the podcast folks.

1059
01:09:44,249 --> 01:09:48,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, our live listeners lost us, but we show we're still connected and uploading data to the feed.

1060
01:09:48,471 --> 01:09:51,373
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to just keep right on moving.

1061
01:09:51,912 --> 01:09:59,094
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so anyhow, Kickstarter, yes, there is an alternative to Kickstarter called Gambitious.

1062
01:09:59,414 --> 01:10:02,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, this is how the folks overseas are going to get into this.

1063
01:10:03,416 --> 01:10:07,637
[SPEAKER_08]: European indie developers will get this opportunity to use this.

1064
01:10:07,677 --> 01:10:08,977
[SPEAKER_08]: There are some differences.

1065
01:10:09,197 --> 01:10:10,318
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a Dutch company.

1066
01:10:11,218 --> 01:10:14,819
[SPEAKER_08]: They will be filling the crowdfunding void by using their own service.

1067
01:10:15,519 --> 01:10:17,740
[SPEAKER_08]: You won't be donating funds to receive gifts.

1068
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:21,381
[SPEAKER_08]: You're actually going to purchase shares of a game's development.

1069
01:10:21,621 --> 01:10:23,663
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's almost like a little mini stock market or something.

1070
01:10:23,943 --> 01:10:31,389
[SPEAKER_08]: When the game is completed, the user gets dividends like a traditional investor rather than a copy of a game or a lunch date or whatever it is that you're doing.

1071
01:10:31,409 --> 01:10:32,050
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of cool.

1072
01:10:32,710 --> 01:10:34,532
[SPEAKER_08]: It's different.

1073
01:10:35,113 --> 01:10:37,454
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a very smart British way of thinking about it.

1074
01:10:37,835 --> 01:10:38,595
[SPEAKER_07]: I like it.

1075
01:10:38,656 --> 01:10:39,977
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish they would do something like that over here.

1076
01:10:39,997 --> 01:10:41,498
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be kind of cool.

1077
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:44,800
[SPEAKER_07]: Very strange.

1078
01:10:46,221 --> 01:10:46,541
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1079
01:10:47,462 --> 01:10:52,206
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's move on to a segment we like to do every week here on the show.

1080
01:10:52,846 --> 01:10:53,627
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we're not live.

1081
01:10:53,707 --> 01:10:55,869
[SPEAKER_08]: We still have a big group that listens to us on the podcast.

1082
01:10:56,109 --> 01:10:59,531
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the record, they say that the play button's got to slash through it.

1083
01:10:59,692 --> 01:11:01,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I just went to the site and it looks fine to me.

1084
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:03,221
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1085
01:11:30,427 --> 01:11:41,554
[SPEAKER_02]: The game is Kid Icarus, also known in Japan as Hikari Shinwa Palutena no Kagami, which is Light Mythology Palutena's Mirror.

1086
01:11:41,755 --> 01:11:50,280
[SPEAKER_02]: It is an action platform game that came out on the Famicom Disk System in Japan and cartridge in US and North America and in Europe.

1087
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:51,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, that's what I meant.

1088
01:11:52,821 --> 01:12:03,946
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the very first Kid Icarus game, and it came out in Japan in December 1986, and in Europe and North America in February and July 1987 respectively.

1089
01:12:04,746 --> 01:12:08,508
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a GBA version in 2004, a Wii Virtual Console version in 2007,

1090
01:12:09,808 --> 01:12:19,718
[SPEAKER_02]: and the sequel that came out on Game Boy in 1991 and of course the third version that came out on Nintendo 3DS in March 2012.

1091
01:12:20,439 --> 01:12:24,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, having played a little bit of it, loved it, won it, oh my god.

1092
01:12:24,383 --> 01:12:24,783
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway.

1093
01:12:25,864 --> 01:12:38,549
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, you are Pit, who is a cute little angel, trying to find the three sacred treasures, which he has to use to rescue their goddess of angel land, Palutena.

1094
01:12:39,770 --> 01:12:44,432
[SPEAKER_02]: You basically go through different areas where you can scroll up, and you've got your little...

1095
01:12:46,272 --> 01:12:52,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Dungeon levels where you have to go on kind of like a grid map type thing and it's really a neat little game.

1096
01:12:54,678 --> 01:13:11,769
[SPEAKER_02]: You basically have to reach the end of the levels, defeat the monster that guards the three treasures and it actually was done by Nintendo's Research and Development 1 division that meant it was designed by Toru Asawa and Yoshio Sakamoto and directed by Satoru Okada.

1097
01:13:12,289 --> 01:13:13,250
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know who produced it?

1098
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:14,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Gunpei Yokoi.

1099
01:13:15,831 --> 01:13:16,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is the man?

1100
01:13:17,373 --> 01:13:23,557
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, it actually had kind of mixed reception when it came out.

1101
01:13:23,597 --> 01:13:25,298
[SPEAKER_02]: There were people that did not like it.

1102
01:13:25,978 --> 01:13:29,641
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's, you know, been a classic to everyone since.

1103
01:13:31,342 --> 01:13:35,645
[SPEAKER_02]: The Game Boy version that came out was Kid Icarus of Myths and Monsters in 1991.

1104
01:13:36,085 --> 01:13:38,106
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we had to wait for 20 years.

1105
01:13:38,767 --> 01:13:41,949
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we have Kid Icarus Uprising and everything's cool.

1106
01:13:42,349 --> 01:13:44,511
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, we still have Pit in Super Smash Bros.

1107
01:13:44,531 --> 01:13:44,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Ball.

1108
01:13:46,232 --> 01:13:48,614
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically with this one, like I said, it is a platformer.

1109
01:13:49,595 --> 01:13:57,341
[SPEAKER_02]: You go through different levels and you collect health, you collect hearts, which you can use to buy stuff.

1110
01:13:58,082 --> 01:13:59,883
[SPEAKER_02]: And you also have a score.

1111
01:14:01,144 --> 01:14:06,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, as you go through that, you can go through different chambers that sometimes they're a market.

1112
01:14:06,906 --> 01:14:10,568
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes you have to defeat certain monsters.

1113
01:14:10,588 --> 01:14:17,890
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a god's chamber where your bow and arrow can be increased in strength by different factors.

1114
01:14:18,811 --> 01:14:25,113
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes it depends on how many enemies you've defeated or how much damage you've taken in battle.

1115
01:14:25,133 --> 01:14:27,434
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you also have a training chamber where

1116
01:14:27,874 --> 01:14:31,996
[SPEAKER_02]: where you can get one of three power items if you pass the test.

1117
01:14:32,876 --> 01:14:37,058
[SPEAKER_02]: So then you have, basically you've got the three stages, the underworld, the surface, and the sky world.

1118
01:14:37,858 --> 01:14:43,401
[SPEAKER_02]: And they have the different levels and the fortress.

1119
01:14:44,501 --> 01:14:51,985
[SPEAKER_02]: And all the first levels are, the underworld and sky stages are basically ones where you're going bottom to top.

1120
01:14:52,585 --> 01:14:54,886
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the last one is a side-scrolling level.

1121
01:14:56,243 --> 01:14:56,883
[SPEAKER_02]: The surface world.

1122
01:14:56,923 --> 01:14:57,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, it's side-scrolling.

1123
01:14:59,644 --> 01:15:04,866
[SPEAKER_02]: The fortresses are non-scrolling rooms, and you have to find and defeat the gatekeeper.

1124
01:15:05,766 --> 01:15:11,428
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can buy a check sheet, a pencil, and a torch so that you can basically track yourself on your map.

1125
01:15:12,669 --> 01:15:18,311
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can get a hammer that destroys statues, which will free a flying soldier called a centurion that will aid you in boss battles.

1126
01:15:19,531 --> 01:15:22,933
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when each of the bosses are destroyed, you get one of the sacred treasures.

1127
01:15:23,173 --> 01:15:23,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Blah, blah, blah.

1128
01:15:25,433 --> 01:15:30,837
[SPEAKER_02]: and the last portion are kind of like a scrolling shooter.

1129
01:15:31,037 --> 01:15:31,777
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty interesting.

1130
01:15:32,958 --> 01:15:44,586
[SPEAKER_02]: So the game, like I said, was done by a Nintendo's R&D1 division which was actually the programming was done by an outside company called Intelligent Systems.

1131
01:15:45,266 --> 01:15:54,933
[SPEAKER_02]: It was meant for the disc system because with the disc card you could have three times the storage capacity than the NES cartridges.

1132
01:15:55,833 --> 01:16:00,356
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it also could save your progress, given that it was on a floppy disk.

1133
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:14,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, when it came out on the Nintendo in the US, it was on a cartridge with a password system.

1134
01:16:17,628 --> 01:16:18,108
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh...

1135
01:16:19,856 --> 01:16:23,378
[SPEAKER_02]: This, a lot went into the creation of this game, actually.

1136
01:16:23,518 --> 01:16:30,241
[SPEAKER_02]: It was even said that, um, all of the, uh, the pixel art was drawn by, um, Otsawa himself.

1137
01:16:30,662 --> 01:16:31,302
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool.

1138
01:16:33,123 --> 01:16:44,109
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, it was re-released in, um, 19, uh, sorry, in 2004 in Japan as the Famicom Mini Disk System Selection for the GBA.

1139
01:16:44,709 --> 01:16:46,390
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, we got it on the Virtual Console in 2007.

1140
01:16:46,430 --> 01:16:46,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1141
01:16:50,572 --> 01:16:52,793
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, remember the cheat codes, Rob?

1142
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,015
[SPEAKER_08]: I do.

1143
01:16:55,095 --> 01:16:57,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasn't there like Medusa fights Icarus angels or vice versa?

1144
01:16:57,937 --> 01:17:00,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Icarus fights Medusa angels.

1145
01:17:00,478 --> 01:17:02,259
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was terror, danger, horror.

1146
01:17:02,419 --> 01:17:02,720
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1147
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,062
[SPEAKER_08]: They took that out of the 3DS remake, if you can believe it.

1148
01:17:06,362 --> 01:17:06,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they did.

1149
01:17:07,002 --> 01:17:08,563
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was leading up to.

1150
01:17:08,583 --> 01:17:09,504
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my bad.

1151
01:17:10,084 --> 01:17:24,769
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, there were, uh, when, uh, there was, uh, the eShop version of the download code that was given to those who registered two 3DS games, um, with Nintendo in Japan and Europe, or pre-ordered Kid Icarus Uprisings.

1152
01:17:25,569 --> 01:17:27,430
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that was pretty neat.

1153
01:17:28,770 --> 01:17:29,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Boo to them!

1154
01:17:50,059 --> 01:17:52,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of it had to do with their rather dated graphics.

1155
01:17:54,782 --> 01:18:08,152
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was said in Retro Gamer, which is a magazine that Dan and I pick up sometimes, that it was the unsung hero of the NES, looks and sounds pretty, and said that the music is sublime and the enemy characters are brilliantly drawn.

1156
01:18:08,912 --> 01:18:11,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Which I have to agree with every single last bit of that.

1157
01:18:11,994 --> 01:18:12,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, um...

1158
01:18:14,854 --> 01:18:21,876
[SPEAKER_02]: JeremyParishWithOneUp.com said that it was a fairly forgotten masterpiece and that it was underwhelming, buggy, and annoying.

1159
01:18:22,656 --> 01:18:23,196
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

1160
01:18:23,377 --> 01:18:24,077
[SPEAKER_02]: I say shut up.

1161
01:18:25,217 --> 01:18:25,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Agreed.

1162
01:18:27,118 --> 01:18:27,958
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is.

1163
01:18:28,178 --> 01:18:29,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I will say this.

1164
01:18:29,978 --> 01:18:31,759
[SPEAKER_02]: That game is freaking hard as fuck.

1165
01:18:33,038 --> 01:18:33,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1166
01:18:54,389 --> 01:18:58,493
[SPEAKER_02]: and we've even seen Pit in Tetris, remember when you win on the harder levels?

1167
01:18:59,274 --> 01:19:00,955
[SPEAKER_02]: He pops up on the little win screen.

1168
01:19:02,677 --> 01:19:05,420
[SPEAKER_02]: F1 Race and Super Smash Bros.

1169
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:08,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Melee and he was a playable character in Super Smash Bros.

1170
01:19:08,322 --> 01:19:11,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Brawl and they completely redesigned his appearance for that game.

1171
01:19:13,030 --> 01:19:15,672
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1172
01:19:43,427 --> 01:19:44,148
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I liked?

1173
01:19:44,188 --> 01:19:46,129
[SPEAKER_02]: What I used to do in this one when you get turned into an eggplant?

1174
01:19:46,669 --> 01:19:49,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Is I would hold down and then slide across the floor as an eggplant.

1175
01:19:49,512 --> 01:19:49,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1176
01:19:49,872 --> 01:19:50,913
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't see his little legs.

1177
01:19:51,813 --> 01:19:52,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, that was the best.

1178
01:19:55,776 --> 01:20:04,202
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, they revealed Kid Icarus Uprising in E3 2010 and sent me a 3D shooter that was developed by Project Sora.

1179
01:20:05,463 --> 01:20:11,628
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the same company that the Smash Bros.

1180
01:20:11,648 --> 01:20:14,390
[SPEAKER_02]: designer Masahiro Sakurai is from.

1181
01:20:15,711 --> 01:20:17,232
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of does go back to that.

1182
01:20:19,591 --> 01:20:21,793
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1183
01:20:39,772 --> 01:20:42,895
[SPEAKER_02]: and had a reverse difficulty curve.

1184
01:20:43,315 --> 01:20:46,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you can play it 16-bit on your web browser.

1185
01:20:47,118 --> 01:20:50,661
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what became of that, because honestly, that's the first I had ever heard of it.

1186
01:20:51,362 --> 01:20:52,863
[SPEAKER_02]: But now I kind of want to find it and play it.

1187
01:20:53,584 --> 01:20:54,965
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's our game, Kid Icarus.

1188
01:20:57,307 --> 01:21:00,289
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, there it is, your classic game of the week, Kid Icarus on the NES.

1189
01:21:00,489 --> 01:21:03,452
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think that the original name is pretty cool, though.

1190
01:21:04,533 --> 01:21:06,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I do, I like that too.

1191
01:21:07,475 --> 01:21:08,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Light Mythology.

1192
01:21:09,652 --> 01:21:09,973
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1193
01:21:10,753 --> 01:21:12,454
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't know what's going on with the live feed.

1194
01:21:12,614 --> 01:21:14,035
[SPEAKER_08]: We're still showing that we're sending data.

1195
01:21:14,115 --> 01:21:16,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently, the server itself is down.

1196
01:21:17,357 --> 01:21:20,680
[SPEAKER_08]: So we don't know what's up.

1197
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:26,964
[SPEAKER_08]: According to folks in chat, this seems to be like a legit server crash that's happening, what have you.

1198
01:21:27,044 --> 01:21:27,945
[SPEAKER_08]: So we don't know what's up.

1199
01:21:27,965 --> 01:21:29,926
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to need to take a little bit of a break here.

1200
01:21:32,901 --> 01:21:36,265
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to go ahead and play music anyway, even though the podcasters won't hear it.

1201
01:21:36,606 --> 01:21:40,591
[SPEAKER_08]: But at least it's a chance for us to take a break and figure out how we're going to broadcast Part B. We'll be right back.

1202
01:21:47,228 --> 01:21:49,790
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1203
01:21:49,870 --> 01:21:54,293
[SPEAKER_08]: We are live, sorta, on this Sunday evening, April the 22nd of 2012.

1204
01:21:56,094 --> 01:21:58,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Just what's going on for the live folks real quick.

1205
01:21:58,916 --> 01:22:04,259
[SPEAKER_08]: We flipped it to Ustream, which obviously you're figuring this out if you're connecting to the feed right now.

1206
01:22:04,419 --> 01:22:06,881
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you see, yes, that video really is live.

1207
01:22:07,281 --> 01:22:08,562
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my little hand waving in front of it.

1208
01:22:08,922 --> 01:22:10,623
[SPEAKER_08]: We're shy, so you get to look at Mr. Chocobo.

1209
01:22:13,081 --> 01:22:14,703
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know what's going on with All Games.

1210
01:22:15,443 --> 01:22:17,605
[SPEAKER_08]: I am still streaming to the All Games server.

1211
01:22:17,685 --> 01:22:21,909
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm streaming to both right now, so this is going to be interesting to see if we can have the bandwidth for it.

1212
01:22:22,309 --> 01:22:28,435
[SPEAKER_08]: But the All Games server crashed, or something happened, so we don't know what's up.

1213
01:22:28,735 --> 01:22:38,924
[SPEAKER_08]: And guys, we suspect it's not... I realize there was a big announcement this week, and people are coming up with conspiracy theories, but we think if it was that, which would be...

1214
01:22:39,384 --> 01:22:40,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Silly if it was that.

1215
01:22:41,366 --> 01:22:47,551
[SPEAKER_08]: We would just have the access to stream to the feed taken away altogether because they know the IP we broadcast from.

1216
01:22:48,032 --> 01:22:49,213
[SPEAKER_08]: So we don't think it's that.

1217
01:22:49,313 --> 01:22:51,134
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just how ironic.

1218
01:22:51,955 --> 01:22:52,796
[SPEAKER_08]: How ironic.

1219
01:22:53,376 --> 01:22:54,998
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like rain on your wedding day.

1220
01:22:55,899 --> 01:22:56,299
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

1221
01:22:57,059 --> 01:22:59,742
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1222
01:23:18,599 --> 01:23:19,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't change anything.

1223
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:23,142
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll still get next week's show at the same time and all that good stuff.

1224
01:23:24,543 --> 01:23:24,783
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1225
01:23:25,663 --> 01:23:28,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, let's try to move on with the show best we can.

1226
01:23:29,346 --> 01:23:31,487
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to move into some rapid fire news.

1227
01:23:31,727 --> 01:23:31,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

1228
01:23:32,288 --> 01:23:36,070
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess DarkSakura's computer just crashed on top of everything else.

1229
01:23:36,450 --> 01:23:38,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Won't anything work?

1230
01:23:38,652 --> 01:23:41,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is technology... Because this is a piece of shit and my husband won't buy me an iPad.

1231
01:23:41,773 --> 01:23:44,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is technology revolting against us?

1232
01:23:44,455 --> 01:23:46,176
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like the fucking Terminator.

1233
01:23:46,937 --> 01:23:47,057
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1234
01:23:49,158 --> 01:23:50,159
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1235
01:24:18,316 --> 01:24:22,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Paint Park is basically a basic paint program.

1236
01:24:22,998 --> 01:24:28,680
[SPEAKER_07]: You can take pictures of crap and draw and share it with your friends and do all that fun stuff.

1237
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:32,301
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus, I believe you can actually draw with friends, maybe?

1238
01:24:33,241 --> 01:24:36,182
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can also use the rear touchpad and the front touchpad and all that fun stuff.

1239
01:24:36,682 --> 01:24:38,323
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's neat.

1240
01:24:38,624 --> 01:24:42,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Then later this summer, they're going to be introducing Treasure Park and Wake Up Call.

1241
01:24:44,548 --> 01:24:53,355
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess Treasure Park is an app that lets you create your own puzzles and send them out to your friends using Near and I guess 3G.

1242
01:24:53,876 --> 01:25:02,963
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also Wake Up Call is an alarm clock app that syncs with your alarm or syncs your alarm with other PlayStation Vita users.

1243
01:25:04,491 --> 01:25:06,453
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't understand why you would want to do that.

1244
01:25:07,073 --> 01:25:15,540
[SPEAKER_07]: And it says there's also a competitive element where players can set goals and are awarded for meeting or exceeding... I don't get it.

1245
01:25:15,640 --> 01:25:16,301
[SPEAKER_07]: That's stupid.

1246
01:25:17,702 --> 01:25:18,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Set your alarm.

1247
01:25:19,043 --> 01:25:19,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Goal!

1248
01:25:20,865 --> 01:25:21,725
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the point of that?

1249
01:25:21,905 --> 01:25:23,166
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't make any sense.

1250
01:25:23,807 --> 01:25:26,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Turning alarm clocks into a video game.

1251
01:25:26,329 --> 01:25:26,729
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure.

1252
01:25:28,230 --> 01:25:31,233
[SPEAKER_08]: How quickly you answer the alarm, I don't understand.

1253
01:25:31,713 --> 01:25:33,315
[SPEAKER_08]: I could use something like that, actually.

1254
01:25:33,355 --> 01:25:35,756
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the type of person that will hit the damn snooze for an hour.

1255
01:25:35,857 --> 01:25:37,098
[SPEAKER_08]: So something to motivate me.

1256
01:25:37,458 --> 01:25:38,238
[SPEAKER_09]: I set four alarms.

1257
01:25:39,019 --> 01:25:40,520
[SPEAKER_08]: and actually get out of bed.

1258
01:25:40,540 --> 01:25:45,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, a shiny sticker for my alarm clock park or whatever it's called.

1259
01:25:45,121 --> 01:25:46,802
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, Paint Park is available right now.

1260
01:25:46,842 --> 01:25:50,504
[SPEAKER_07]: It is free so you can check it out and play around with that.

1261
01:25:50,544 --> 01:25:56,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, I haven't turned my Vita on in a few weeks so I missed a lot of stuff on there.

1262
01:25:56,586 --> 01:25:59,207
[SPEAKER_07]: I downloaded the Wipeout demo.

1263
01:25:59,227 --> 01:26:01,908
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to check that out because people keep saying that's a good game to get.

1264
01:26:02,288 --> 01:26:26,008
[SPEAKER_07]: and then also there's like some AR thing with resistance that you can play with and then there's that other free like puzzle game that they've got where I guess it's limited plays per day or something like that hey but it's free so you can try it and if it sucks you can delete it I still have to have an 8 gig card I still have to move everything over to but I haven't gotten a chance to do that yet so fun fun

1265
01:26:28,035 --> 01:26:29,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1266
01:26:29,255 --> 01:26:39,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Something else that's kind of cool DLC-wise, you know, LittleBigPlanet had a lot of cool DLC when it came out, and of course they're going to kind of continue on doing it with that LittleBigPlanet carting.

1267
01:26:40,419 --> 01:26:48,282
[SPEAKER_07]: With pre-order, I'm assuming at major retailers, Amazon GameStop they're mentioning, you get free Kevin Butler DLC.

1268
01:26:48,402 --> 01:26:50,402
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, the fake VP himself.

1269
01:26:50,843 --> 01:26:55,344
[SPEAKER_07]: You get the Sackboy costume and his golf cart to play.

1270
01:26:55,384 --> 01:26:55,804
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura,

1271
01:27:14,722 --> 01:27:27,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, last but not least, there's a rumor, or I should say a campaign, sort of, to bring Archer, the FX animated series, to Pinball FX as a table.

1272
01:27:27,759 --> 01:27:29,140
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently this is...

1273
01:27:31,368 --> 01:27:35,729
[SPEAKER_07]: came to fruition via some tweets from the Archer production designer.

1274
01:27:35,849 --> 01:27:39,510
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess someone tweeted the Archer production designer and art director.

1275
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:44,651
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he's like, well, yeah, hey, that sounds like a cool idea.

1276
01:27:44,671 --> 01:27:50,813
[SPEAKER_07]: If Zen Studios wants to do it, then I guess we can send the idea to FX and see if they're game for it.

1277
01:27:50,833 --> 01:27:52,874
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Zen Studios is like, hell yeah, we'll do it.

1278
01:27:53,454 --> 01:27:58,315
[SPEAKER_07]: And so now it's kind of in FX's hands to whether or not they were going to

1279
01:27:58,795 --> 01:28:05,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Put the wheels in motion, I guess, and they're going to swap contact information and maybe we'll have an Archer table someday.

1280
01:28:05,557 --> 01:28:07,158
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be neat.

1281
01:28:07,218 --> 01:28:08,838
[SPEAKER_08]: That would actually be all kinds of awesome.

1282
01:28:08,918 --> 01:28:09,999
[SPEAKER_08]: I so support this idea.

1283
01:28:10,539 --> 01:28:13,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though, if I recall correctly, Pinball FX has a spy table.

1284
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:14,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Who cares?

1285
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:16,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Archer's like ten times better than that.

1286
01:28:17,281 --> 01:28:18,261
[SPEAKER_07]: It's sad.

1287
01:28:18,461 --> 01:28:20,562
[SPEAKER_07]: I really wanted to like Archer, but I hate it.

1288
01:28:21,022 --> 01:28:21,302
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1289
01:28:22,423 --> 01:28:23,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Archer's hilarious.

1290
01:28:23,924 --> 01:28:24,425
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate it.

1291
01:28:24,785 --> 01:28:25,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, I hate you.

1292
01:28:25,906 --> 01:28:26,806
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's the thing, though.

1293
01:28:27,026 --> 01:28:28,888
[SPEAKER_07]: I hated The Office when I first watched it, too.

1294
01:28:29,268 --> 01:28:33,131
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of those things that you gotta go back later on and you're like, oh, this is funny.

1295
01:28:33,371 --> 01:28:35,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Or like It's Always Sunny in Fel- No, actually, It's Always Sunny in Fel-

1296
01:28:36,673 --> 01:28:38,235
[SPEAKER_07]: But it looks stupid.

1297
01:28:38,275 --> 01:28:39,776
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Always Sunny looked terrible.

1298
01:28:40,256 --> 01:28:40,737
[SPEAKER_08]: That's true.

1299
01:28:40,797 --> 01:28:43,720
[SPEAKER_08]: The first time I watched It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, I hated it.

1300
01:28:43,780 --> 01:28:46,042
[SPEAKER_08]: But now I think it's one of the most hilarious shows on TV.

1301
01:28:46,122 --> 01:28:49,425
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm willing to go back and try it again.

1302
01:28:49,545 --> 01:28:52,367
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's just right now, I don't know.

1303
01:28:52,387 --> 01:28:53,008
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have time.

1304
01:28:53,048 --> 01:28:55,911
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'll eventually go back and watch Archer and hopefully enjoy it.

1305
01:28:56,931 --> 01:28:58,452
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me just quickly plug our chat room.

1306
01:28:58,552 --> 01:29:00,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com.

1307
01:29:00,432 --> 01:29:02,753
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if any stragglers are finding us through Ustream.

1308
01:29:02,773 --> 01:29:03,993
[SPEAKER_08]: This is our backup right now.

1309
01:29:04,333 --> 01:29:07,614
[SPEAKER_08]: The all-game server stopped responding, so we're continuing on with the show.

1310
01:29:07,654 --> 01:29:09,254
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't stop us that easily, Internet.

1311
01:29:09,714 --> 01:29:10,655
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're continuing on.

1312
01:29:11,155 --> 01:29:13,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com if you want to chat with us.

1313
01:29:13,095 --> 01:29:17,056
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't even know if the Ustream TV chat room is there, but if it is, we're not looking at it.

1314
01:29:17,336 --> 01:29:24,558
[SPEAKER_08]: So you need to go to Chat.OrangeLawnTrader.com to chat with us live as we're doing our little radio show on this Sunday evening.

1315
01:29:24,998 --> 01:29:28,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, I want to open up the Ask Orange Lounge line.

1316
01:29:28,502 --> 01:29:36,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Send a private message to Sky, S-K-I-E, in the chat room at chat.orangelounge.com if you have a question for Ask Orange Lounge.

1317
01:29:36,432 --> 01:29:40,056
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to get to that shortly after a few more stories.

1318
01:29:40,597 --> 01:29:40,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Quickly...

1319
01:29:41,698 --> 01:29:47,840
[SPEAKER_08]: This is really sad, and this is something I think it happened on the week we were off, but we need to say it and tip our hat to this.

1320
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:52,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Jack Tramiel, he founded the company that created the Commodore 64.

1321
01:29:53,942 --> 01:30:07,187
[SPEAKER_08]: He died at the age of 83, according to Forbes magazine, and if you grew up on the Commodore family of computers like I did, then Jack Tramiel was obviously somebody important to you, so rest in peace.

1322
01:30:08,087 --> 01:30:36,876
[SPEAKER_07]: um going to a completely different topic here on Nintendo uh real quick I'm sorry I don't I didn't have a 64 but uh wasn't it like the command to like start a program or something like 80 something or load quote star quote comma eight comma one uh that would be ironic if it was four you know what there were um that was actually the same uh command on the Apple IIe wasn't no Apple for some of the games that I played it was

1323
01:30:37,563 --> 01:30:39,145
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought Apple did something different.

1324
01:30:39,205 --> 01:30:42,148
[SPEAKER_08]: It was similar, but it wasn't the star.

1325
01:30:42,188 --> 01:30:43,810
[SPEAKER_08]: The star was unique to Commodore.

1326
01:30:43,830 --> 01:30:44,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Comma 8, Comma 1.

1327
01:30:44,951 --> 01:30:47,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Because Comma 8 is what called out the disk drive.

1328
01:30:47,434 --> 01:30:49,456
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think if you had a tape drive, it was Comma 7.

1329
01:30:50,477 --> 01:30:54,682
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember doing the Comma 8, Comma 1 on the Apple.

1330
01:30:54,742 --> 01:30:55,983
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you sure you weren't playing the Comma?

1331
01:30:56,003 --> 01:30:56,504
[SPEAKER_02]: For Lode Runner.

1332
01:30:58,533 --> 01:30:58,773
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1333
01:30:58,793 --> 01:31:00,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Lode Runner was multi-platform.

1334
01:31:00,295 --> 01:31:01,697
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, let's move on.

1335
01:31:01,938 --> 01:31:04,962
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm talking about Miyamoto being a damn tease.

1336
01:31:05,703 --> 01:31:13,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Miyamoto had a conversation with Edge at edgeonline.com and yeah, he was talking about some first party stuff because that

1337
01:31:13,473 --> 01:31:14,033
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1338
01:31:41,541 --> 01:31:46,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, you know, this has led to rampant speculation and internet wank about the whole thing.

1339
01:31:46,644 --> 01:31:57,389
[SPEAKER_08]: But, I mean, I love the idea of a new Link to the Past, but, hold on, wasn't Zelda Four Swords on the GameCube kind of a redo of the Link to the Past?

1340
01:31:57,650 --> 01:32:01,652
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not like that idea hasn't been touched since the Super Nintendo days.

1341
01:32:01,672 --> 01:32:02,252
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not true.

1342
01:32:02,292 --> 01:32:06,214
[SPEAKER_08]: The Game Boy Advance games and the portable games were really like that until it went all Wind Waker.

1343
01:32:06,554 --> 01:32:07,875
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have to make a rebuttal real quick.

1344
01:32:07,975 --> 01:32:08,075
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1345
01:32:08,095 --> 01:32:09,656
[SPEAKER_02]: I was thinking of my cousin's Commodore 64.

1346
01:32:11,175 --> 01:32:11,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, okay.

1347
01:32:11,736 --> 01:32:11,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1348
01:32:12,096 --> 01:32:12,597
[SPEAKER_08]: That's alright.

1349
01:32:13,818 --> 01:32:24,791
[SPEAKER_07]: It would mean, to me, I think he's looking at kind of like doing the new Super Mario approach to it where basically they kind of do an updated engine but kind of old school play style.

1350
01:32:25,251 --> 01:32:29,276
[SPEAKER_07]: So you would have like an updated engine but it would be a top down Zelda game kind of like it was.

1351
01:32:29,836 --> 01:32:36,061
[SPEAKER_07]: But my god, put an editor in there, put a community feature where people can create their own quests and stuff like that.

1352
01:32:37,001 --> 01:32:40,204
[SPEAKER_07]: You're talking like money in the bank right there.

1353
01:32:40,224 --> 01:32:41,425
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it would be epic.

1354
01:32:41,985 --> 01:32:49,571
[SPEAKER_07]: And it would be really something that Nintendo would kind of say, Hey, look, we understand the internet and community features and stuff like that.

1355
01:32:49,611 --> 01:32:54,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead of pretending that you do or saying, Hey, now we can do updates.

1356
01:32:54,495 --> 01:32:55,956
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, if our games are buggy.

1357
01:32:56,616 --> 01:32:57,357
[SPEAKER_07]: We're with it.

1358
01:32:57,497 --> 01:32:58,137
[SPEAKER_07]: We're cool.

1359
01:33:00,919 --> 01:33:06,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, this is the other big part of this is that he was asked about F-Zero.

1360
01:33:06,782 --> 01:33:07,262
[SPEAKER_08]: So excited.

1361
01:33:07,402 --> 01:33:16,528
[SPEAKER_08]: And he did say this, quote, maybe with future hardware with Wii U coming up, maybe we could create something that does make sense either as a smaller game or a fully fledged title.

1362
01:33:17,478 --> 01:33:18,359
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, please.

1363
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:20,821
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's an interesting way for him to phrase it.

1364
01:33:21,181 --> 01:33:22,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Either as a smaller game.

1365
01:33:23,163 --> 01:33:27,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Could this be talking about like a Wii U-ware type of game?

1366
01:33:27,507 --> 01:33:29,089
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that what we're talking about?

1367
01:33:29,189 --> 01:33:30,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Or small as in portable?

1368
01:33:31,311 --> 01:33:37,196
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot you can read into that and probably way more than Miyamoto intended anybody, but you will not calm the fanboy wank down.

1369
01:33:38,397 --> 01:33:38,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Riddle me this.

1370
01:33:40,479 --> 01:33:46,302
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm assuming that this little tablet controller thing that they're going to put out is probably going to have some sort of ARM processor in there.

1371
01:33:46,702 --> 01:33:49,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Something that can, you know, obviously render some video and that kind of stuff.

1372
01:33:50,264 --> 01:33:53,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, a lot of these tablet devices are based off of certain ARM processors.

1373
01:33:53,586 --> 01:33:57,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you, for example, and there are some other patents, which I don't know if we have a story on, but whatever.

1374
01:33:57,828 --> 01:34:01,710
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, could you, for example, imagine that...

1375
01:34:02,330 --> 01:34:03,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, guess what?

1376
01:34:03,411 --> 01:34:12,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like, you know, the Pocket Station or even like the Vita or something like that, you know, hey, you can take a version of your gaming experience on the road with you.

1377
01:34:12,594 --> 01:34:18,397
[SPEAKER_07]: So, for example, like, hey, we're going to create like a virtual console app that runs on this tablet.

1378
01:34:18,457 --> 01:34:18,897
[SPEAKER_07]: And guess what?

1379
01:34:18,937 --> 01:34:19,297
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

1380
01:34:19,337 --> 01:34:26,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Not only does a tablet stream your gameplay from the TV, but you can take that tablet with you and play on the road.

1381
01:34:29,262 --> 01:34:30,122
[SPEAKER_07]: These, like, games.

1382
01:34:31,795 --> 01:34:33,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, but there's the whole like streaming.

1383
01:34:34,698 --> 01:34:36,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it doesn't have to stream the content.

1384
01:34:36,259 --> 01:34:38,761
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm saying that the processor would be able to render its own content.

1385
01:34:40,883 --> 01:34:47,129
[SPEAKER_07]: And yes, you could do this also with the 3DS where you would have just a virtual console game or, you know, 3DS app or something like that.

1386
01:34:47,630 --> 01:34:56,578
[SPEAKER_07]: But it would be kind of a neat way to get people interested because, well, then again, they would also kind of cut themselves in the knee by, you know,

1387
01:34:57,987 --> 01:35:03,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically offering a portable system with a console system, but it might get people to buy the system.

1388
01:35:03,971 --> 01:35:04,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Very true.

1389
01:35:05,632 --> 01:35:09,935
[SPEAKER_08]: One more story for you guys before I turn it over to DarkSakura, and that is for you Bomani fans.

1390
01:35:09,995 --> 01:35:10,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Where are you at?

1391
01:35:10,896 --> 01:35:11,276
[SPEAKER_08]: Holla.

1392
01:35:12,077 --> 01:35:12,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Beatmania2DX20.

1393
01:35:15,599 --> 01:35:23,805
[SPEAKER_08]: or as I like to call it 20th style even though that pisses the hardcore off because this is really called Beatmania 2DX20 Tricoro is the name of the game.

1394
01:35:24,125 --> 01:35:26,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Konami has confirmed it exists.

1395
01:35:26,466 --> 01:35:27,027
[SPEAKER_08]: It exists.

1396
01:35:27,267 --> 01:35:28,308
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called Tricoro.

1397
01:35:29,188 --> 01:35:37,914
[SPEAKER_08]: The three color scheme is kind of what they're going with with the whole red, yellow, blue and location testing is underway April 19th through the 24th in Japan.

1398
01:35:38,837 --> 01:35:40,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy birthday to me in Japan.

1399
01:35:41,619 --> 01:35:42,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Right?

1400
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:43,980
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to be honest.

1401
01:35:44,020 --> 01:35:49,303
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't followed the Beatmania 2DX series since about... What style was like DJ Troopers?

1402
01:35:49,423 --> 01:35:50,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably even before that.

1403
01:35:50,384 --> 01:35:50,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy Sky.

1404
01:35:51,004 --> 01:35:50,984
12, 13.

1405
01:35:52,285 --> 01:35:55,306
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the last one I actually touched was an Empress.

1406
01:35:56,307 --> 01:35:56,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wow.

1407
01:35:56,847 --> 01:35:58,048
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't even play an Empress ever.

1408
01:35:58,728 --> 01:36:00,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, but they did have the PS2.

1409
01:36:00,430 --> 01:36:00,930
[SPEAKER_08]: I keep forgetting.

1410
01:36:00,950 --> 01:36:03,052
[SPEAKER_08]: They cranked out those PS2 games, right?

1411
01:36:03,112 --> 01:36:04,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Empress was the last one.

1412
01:36:04,713 --> 01:36:05,434
[SPEAKER_08]: I keep forgetting that.

1413
01:36:07,316 --> 01:36:08,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there you go, anyway.

1414
01:36:09,497 --> 01:36:12,480
[SPEAKER_08]: 2DX 20th is happening and it's location testing right now.

1415
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:13,481
[SPEAKER_08]: But Monty's not dead.

1416
01:36:14,562 --> 01:36:15,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Not in Japan.

1417
01:36:16,403 --> 01:36:18,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's a few other things.

1418
01:36:18,345 --> 01:36:21,668
[SPEAKER_02]: How about some new Kinect games that are for kids?

1419
01:36:22,288 --> 01:36:23,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I kind of want to get one of these.

1420
01:36:24,630 --> 01:36:26,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Kinect Sesame Street TV.

1421
01:36:27,938 --> 01:36:29,880
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got Cookie Monster and Groover!

1422
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:32,021
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no Elmo to be seen!

1423
01:36:32,622 --> 01:36:33,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay.

1424
01:36:33,803 --> 01:36:35,504
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's going to launch autumn 2012.

1425
01:36:35,944 --> 01:36:40,147
[SPEAKER_02]: That's according to Argonaut CEO James Bustall.

1426
01:36:40,708 --> 01:36:45,591
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there is Connect National Geographic, like NatGeoTV it says.

1427
01:36:46,172 --> 01:36:48,874
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's being put up by C21 Media.

1428
01:36:49,574 --> 01:36:50,275
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool.

1429
01:36:51,136 --> 01:36:52,517
[SPEAKER_02]: I would get the Sesame Street one.

1430
01:36:52,757 --> 01:36:53,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

1431
01:36:53,257 --> 01:36:53,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1432
01:36:54,678 --> 01:37:06,746
[SPEAKER_02]: and then there is a leaked trailer that if it's to be believed then Resident Evil 6 will come out on October 2nd I'm sure there's a few people who are still into that series a few

1433
01:37:07,805 --> 01:37:09,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Resident Evil 6 looks hot.

1434
01:37:10,206 --> 01:37:11,887
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of people are very excited about it.

1435
01:37:12,247 --> 01:37:14,168
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not a side story, which is a good thing.

1436
01:37:14,649 --> 01:37:18,451
[SPEAKER_02]: According to this trailer, the protagonist is Wesker's son.

1437
01:37:19,371 --> 01:37:20,892
[SPEAKER_02]: The man who's told to save the world.

1438
01:37:22,453 --> 01:37:27,596
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, last but not least, Brink has sold more than 2.5 million copies worldwide.

1439
01:37:28,236 --> 01:37:29,036
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty cool.

1440
01:37:31,338 --> 01:37:32,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job, Brink.

1441
01:37:32,737 --> 01:37:34,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, Brink!

1442
01:37:35,579 --> 01:37:39,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, that's a lot better than I thought that game did because I thought that game tanked.

1443
01:37:39,841 --> 01:37:43,022
[SPEAKER_07]: But that warrants a sequel, I would say.

1444
01:37:43,663 --> 01:37:44,263
[SPEAKER_07]: That's very true.

1445
01:37:45,143 --> 01:37:46,664
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope they're smart enough not to do one.

1446
01:37:48,425 --> 01:37:55,812
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, well, since tonight was supposed to be kind of a special show at All Games Radio, although the server issues are holding us back, we're still going on Ustream.

1447
01:37:55,832 --> 01:37:57,133
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, it's a different type of special now.

1448
01:37:57,153 --> 01:37:58,514
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a different type of special.

1449
01:37:58,594 --> 01:37:59,555
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fooper now.

1450
01:37:59,595 --> 01:38:00,095
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

1451
01:38:00,115 --> 01:38:00,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Fooper, fooper.

1452
01:38:01,697 --> 01:38:07,302
[SPEAKER_08]: So we thought we would do, instead of the foogle question of the week, we would do Ask Orange Lounge tonight.

1453
01:38:07,322 --> 01:38:09,804
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't do this segment very often, but it's when we open it up.

1454
01:38:09,824 --> 01:38:12,146
[SPEAKER_08]: It is the show where every gamer has a voice.

1455
01:38:12,246 --> 01:38:13,747
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to ask us anything, especially...

1456
01:38:14,789 --> 01:38:17,794
[SPEAKER_08]: with what's going on tonight, you can send a private message.

1457
01:38:18,015 --> 01:38:19,798
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to ask us about life or anything?

1458
01:38:21,862 --> 01:38:24,306
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, you can send that over private message to Sky.

1459
01:38:24,346 --> 01:38:25,388
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's cue up the music.

1460
01:38:30,307 --> 01:38:33,288
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's Ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

1461
01:38:33,748 --> 01:38:36,989
[SPEAKER_08]: What will we find out tonight on Orange Lounge Radio?

1462
01:38:37,750 --> 01:38:41,791
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing I'd like to know is why can't we stream on all games anymore?

1463
01:38:41,811 --> 01:38:45,532
[SPEAKER_08]: It was supposed to be a special show, but leave it to us to get fucked.

1464
01:38:49,854 --> 01:38:50,694
[SPEAKER_08]: First question tonight.

1465
01:38:52,998 --> 01:38:54,339
[SPEAKER_08]: Loco Poco, I love that name.

1466
01:38:55,219 --> 01:38:56,540
[SPEAKER_08]: Reminds me of like Poco Roco.

1467
01:38:57,080 --> 01:39:01,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Loco Poco wants to know, if RuPaul's Drag Race was a fighting game, thank God for serious questions.

1468
01:39:01,823 --> 01:39:03,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank God for serious questions.

1469
01:39:04,485 --> 01:39:11,489
[SPEAKER_08]: If RuPaul's Drag Race was a fighting game, how bad would RuPaul be as a final boss if he had SNK boss syndrome?

1470
01:39:12,864 --> 01:39:13,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know what's funny?

1471
01:39:13,964 --> 01:39:17,025
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you've seen the video for Glamazon, but it's on the internet.

1472
01:39:17,045 --> 01:39:19,366
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the big video that features the three finalists?

1473
01:39:19,826 --> 01:39:22,527
[SPEAKER_08]: It has, like, a video game theme, funny enough.

1474
01:39:22,607 --> 01:39:28,089
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's, you know, the three queens that beat all the other ones, like, being big Glamazon robots stepping up.

1475
01:39:28,109 --> 01:39:33,711
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's a lot of, like, video game graphics in it and stuff, so it was clearly inspired by games.

1476
01:39:33,891 --> 01:39:34,872
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to know something funny?

1477
01:39:35,652 --> 01:39:46,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, in the early 90s, my friend had an avatar online called Glamazon who was a large, buxom, overweight Wonder Woman.

1478
01:39:48,399 --> 01:39:51,020
[SPEAKER_08]: So, how bad would RuPaul be as a final boss?

1479
01:39:53,822 --> 01:40:05,429
[SPEAKER_08]: you would sashay all over your face but seriously what would a dream fighting game crossover that has yet to be done be a dream fighting game crossover that hasn't happened yet

1480
01:40:06,508 --> 01:40:13,052
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know about fighting game, but I do know what I would like as a survival horror game.

1481
01:40:13,452 --> 01:40:14,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like a supernatural game.

1482
01:40:15,694 --> 01:40:17,635
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want a new goddamn Killer Instinct game.

1483
01:40:17,675 --> 01:40:18,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that too much to ask?

1484
01:40:19,156 --> 01:40:21,377
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll say Killer Instinct versus Mortal Kombat.

1485
01:40:21,777 --> 01:40:22,618
[SPEAKER_08]: That works in my head.

1486
01:40:22,638 --> 01:40:23,618
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be pretty epic.

1487
01:40:23,958 --> 01:40:25,199
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to say that for my answer.

1488
01:40:25,599 --> 01:40:33,044
[SPEAKER_02]: I want Pretty Fighter versus Asuka 120%, who only Sega, Saturn fighting game people know what I'm talking about.

1489
01:40:34,345 --> 01:40:37,206
[SPEAKER_08]: Tiger Claw thinks RuPaul's Drag Race would be more of a kart racing game.

1490
01:40:37,826 --> 01:40:40,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Geovidea says RuPaul would be a fierce final boss.

1491
01:40:40,586 --> 01:40:41,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Fierce, fierce.

1492
01:40:42,107 --> 01:40:44,447
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, moving on to a question from Actdeft.

1493
01:40:45,507 --> 01:40:47,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go with a serious question, guys.

1494
01:40:47,048 --> 01:40:47,328
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1495
01:40:47,848 --> 01:40:53,229
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the thing or are the things you have regretted doing in the show and why?

1496
01:40:53,989 --> 01:40:56,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything you think or know you did wrong or shouldn't have done at all?

1497
01:40:59,833 --> 01:41:00,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Regret's a strong word.

1498
01:41:01,634 --> 01:41:02,595
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I know what Loki's is.

1499
01:41:02,655 --> 01:41:02,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.

1500
01:41:03,235 --> 01:41:03,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Karaoke.

1501
01:41:09,125 --> 01:41:10,446
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure there's things I've said.

1502
01:41:10,466 --> 01:41:14,348
[SPEAKER_08]: In fact, I know there's things I've said where I've kind of gone back and changed my mind later on.

1503
01:41:14,388 --> 01:41:16,809
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think, boy, I sounded kind of stupid and ignorant saying that.

1504
01:41:17,529 --> 01:41:19,590
[SPEAKER_08]: My opinion on some games ends up changing.

1505
01:41:19,670 --> 01:41:22,132
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's part of this process.

1506
01:41:22,172 --> 01:41:30,616
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's kind of the risk that we take doing this show every week and having done it for so long is that sometimes we're going to grow up in front of you.

1507
01:41:31,056 --> 01:41:33,217
[SPEAKER_08]: And in a lot of ways, that's kind of happened.

1508
01:41:33,237 --> 01:41:34,398
[SPEAKER_08]: When we started this show...

1509
01:41:35,038 --> 01:41:37,160
[SPEAKER_08]: We were 10 years younger than we are now.

1510
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:40,001
[SPEAKER_08]: We went from being in our early 20s to being our early 30s.

1511
01:41:40,102 --> 01:41:42,263
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think there's just a lot of like kind of growing up that happens.

1512
01:41:43,043 --> 01:41:50,188
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to be honest, although I think the old shows for OLR are great, and I'm really proud of a lot that we accomplished in the old shows.

1513
01:41:50,689 --> 01:41:56,492
[SPEAKER_08]: When I go back and listen to old episodes, like anything before episode like 150, really, I go back and listen to the old stuff.

1514
01:41:56,532 --> 01:42:01,916
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really hard for me to listen to because I'm like, oh God, oh God, there's so much technically wrong with this.

1515
01:42:01,976 --> 01:42:04,498
[SPEAKER_08]: And it just sounds like a hot fucking mess everywhere.

1516
01:42:05,118 --> 01:42:30,901
[SPEAKER_08]: so I mean I wouldn't call that a regret but it's definitely something we've really like learned a lot uh from so I mean otherwise as far as specific instances I I can't maybe when I had my diva fit I'm not really proud of that moment um that was you know back when the show ironically when the show died halfway through and uh something just set me off and I think it was on Justin TV I don't know the place where we used to stream so I don't know um

1517
01:42:33,122 --> 01:42:35,544
[SPEAKER_08]: That wasn't a highlight of my career, certainly.

1518
01:42:36,404 --> 01:42:41,087
[SPEAKER_08]: But regret's a strong word because you learn from every little fuck up, you know?

1519
01:42:42,848 --> 01:42:43,148
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1520
01:42:44,148 --> 01:42:50,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Rama asks, what game you played was so bad you said, fuck this shit, dropped the controller, and left?

1521
01:42:53,072 --> 01:42:56,376
[SPEAKER_08]: What game was so bad you said, fuck this shit, drop the controller and left?

1522
01:42:57,016 --> 01:42:57,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1523
01:42:58,258 --> 01:42:58,939
[SPEAKER_08]: You weren't jumping in.

1524
01:42:58,999 --> 01:43:02,182
[SPEAKER_08]: I assumed you... What would you like to say for regrets?

1525
01:43:02,583 --> 01:43:02,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing.

1526
01:43:05,626 --> 01:43:05,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Bitch.

1527
01:43:06,106 --> 01:43:06,367
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1528
01:43:07,836 --> 01:43:09,237
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't rod rolled you enough.

1529
01:43:11,338 --> 01:43:13,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Game where you drop the controller and said, fuck this shit.

1530
01:43:13,740 --> 01:43:15,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Fusion Frenzy 2.

1531
01:43:15,942 --> 01:43:17,463
[SPEAKER_08]: So fucking terrible.

1532
01:43:17,743 --> 01:43:18,163
[SPEAKER_08]: That game.

1533
01:43:18,323 --> 01:43:20,625
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, what the hell is this garbage that I'm playing?

1534
01:43:20,805 --> 01:43:22,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Yaris would be a good one.

1535
01:43:23,227 --> 01:43:24,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Sonic 4 Episode 1.

1536
01:43:25,288 --> 01:43:26,149
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry to say.

1537
01:43:27,450 --> 01:43:27,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki?

1538
01:43:28,210 --> 01:43:28,871
[SPEAKER_07]: Bullet Witch.

1539
01:43:30,091 --> 01:43:30,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

1540
01:43:30,772 --> 01:43:30,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Oof.

1541
01:43:32,933 --> 01:43:45,656
[SPEAKER_07]: and actually Oni Chambara because it was pretty annoying the whole having to have your sword get dirty and get stuck in zombies is stupid a sword would not get stuck in zombies a sword chops zombies in half

1542
01:43:48,547 --> 01:43:48,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

1543
01:43:48,887 --> 01:43:51,449
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to try to burn through the rest of these questions here pretty quick.

1544
01:43:51,610 --> 01:43:57,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Randy says, Have you guys ever looked through your game collections only to find a sealed game?

1545
01:43:57,534 --> 01:43:57,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, God.

1546
01:43:57,954 --> 01:43:58,535
[SPEAKER_02]: All the time.

1547
01:43:58,695 --> 01:43:59,255
[SPEAKER_02]: All the time.

1548
01:43:59,375 --> 01:44:03,739
[SPEAKER_08]: This happened to my cousin and a shrink-wrapped copy of NBA 2K10 yesterday.

1549
01:44:04,459 --> 01:44:05,160
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Randy.

1550
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:05,660
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1551
01:44:06,140 --> 01:44:10,764
[SPEAKER_02]: I found the Blue Seed RPG about a month ago for Saturn.

1552
01:44:11,465 --> 01:44:12,928
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a copy right over there.

1553
01:44:13,509 --> 01:44:16,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Pilotwings Resort on the 3DS still sitting in the shrink wrap.

1554
01:44:18,098 --> 01:44:18,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Stupid me.

1555
01:44:18,859 --> 01:44:21,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Might as well sell that stuff for new on eBay.

1556
01:44:21,644 --> 01:44:21,905
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1557
01:44:23,587 --> 01:44:25,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Matt, anything that you've had?

1558
01:44:26,568 --> 01:44:34,232
[SPEAKER_07]: I just have copies, but nothing that I didn't know I have because I normally don't leave that stuff shrunk.

1559
01:44:34,832 --> 01:44:42,415
[SPEAKER_07]: I have still a shrunk copy of Earth Defense Force, the original one, because I bought five copies of it.

1560
01:44:42,755 --> 01:44:46,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, actually, I bought three copies when we were selling my work for five bucks each.

1561
01:44:46,917 --> 01:44:48,158
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, I can't pass that up.

1562
01:44:48,418 --> 01:44:50,160
[SPEAKER_07]: I am buying all the copies of those games.

1563
01:44:50,920 --> 01:44:51,421
[SPEAKER_07]: So I kept them.

1564
01:44:51,461 --> 01:44:54,663
[SPEAKER_07]: And funny enough, I actually broke a couple copies of mine.

1565
01:44:54,984 --> 01:45:01,169
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's still worth actually a pretty good amount of money, I think, because it's hard to find now.

1566
01:45:01,749 --> 01:45:02,550
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I'm going to close.

1567
01:45:02,570 --> 01:45:06,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, by the way, Sandbox Games is working on a new version of Earth Defense Force.

1568
01:45:06,693 --> 01:45:09,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, Rob, there is another game that we have that's still shrink-wrapped.

1569
01:45:09,155 --> 01:45:09,475
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

1570
01:45:09,835 --> 01:45:10,056
[SPEAKER_02]: That's...

1571
01:45:13,178 --> 01:45:15,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Gunstar Heroes for the Game Gear.

1572
01:45:15,501 --> 01:45:15,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Serious.

1573
01:45:16,402 --> 01:45:17,544
[SPEAKER_08]: Why when you got the Genesis one?

1574
01:45:17,944 --> 01:45:19,546
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I bought it for Dan as a treat.

1575
01:45:19,646 --> 01:45:20,287
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to end.

1576
01:45:20,467 --> 01:45:22,610
[SPEAKER_08]: No more questions because I got five questions in queue.

1577
01:45:22,650 --> 01:45:24,232
[SPEAKER_08]: So question time is up.

1578
01:45:24,732 --> 01:45:26,394
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to read my question.

1579
01:45:26,414 --> 01:45:27,315
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not reading your question.

1580
01:45:27,335 --> 01:45:28,116
[SPEAKER_02]: My question is great.

1581
01:45:28,817 --> 01:45:31,220
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura asks, why are you so fly?

1582
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:33,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'm hot.

1583
01:45:33,322 --> 01:45:34,804
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, moving on.

1584
01:45:34,944 --> 01:45:44,975
[SPEAKER_08]: GZDR4EV wants to know, according to Wiki, this is a deep question, according to Wiki, 68% of the population believes in some type of religion.

1585
01:45:45,716 --> 01:45:48,779
[SPEAKER_08]: So why aren't there more video games with a religious theme?

1586
01:45:50,069 --> 01:45:50,789
[SPEAKER_02]: controversy.

1587
01:45:51,150 --> 01:45:51,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, people.

1588
01:45:52,190 --> 01:45:57,853
[SPEAKER_02]: You get one little thing about someone's religion wrong and they want to just go, it's sacrilegious.

1589
01:45:58,234 --> 01:45:59,234
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it is part that.

1590
01:45:59,294 --> 01:46:04,877
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, even though the stat is 68% believe, the problem is that split up into how many different types of religions.

1591
01:46:05,437 --> 01:46:08,619
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, and like DarkSakura says, you get something wrong.

1592
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:09,900
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think

1593
01:46:10,874 --> 01:46:20,460
[SPEAKER_08]: You may not kind of put the two in the same category, but I think there's a lot of games where spirituality is a theme, especially a lot of modern RPGs.

1594
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:22,862
[SPEAKER_08]: I think especially a lot of the newer Final Fantasy games.

1595
01:46:23,522 --> 01:46:26,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Mass Effect, to some extent, has a little bit of those themes in it.

1596
01:46:26,824 --> 01:46:34,229
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's not really in your face, but there definitely is questions about the big picture, which is what religion's about.

1597
01:46:34,529 --> 01:46:40,013
[SPEAKER_02]: All these different, especially in RPGs, like you were saying, all these different worlds have their own mythologies.

1598
01:46:40,663 --> 01:46:45,590
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, for example, I'm just, you know, I'm going to use World of Warcraft.

1599
01:46:45,711 --> 01:46:48,034
[SPEAKER_08]: DR4F forgot about Battle of Olympus.

1600
01:46:48,595 --> 01:46:50,097
[SPEAKER_08]: He did.

1601
01:46:50,237 --> 01:46:53,682
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm going to use World of Warcraft as an example just because it's fresh in my mind.

1602
01:46:53,702 --> 01:46:55,004
[SPEAKER_02]: I just finished that Thrall book today.

1603
01:46:55,164 --> 01:46:55,645
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really good.

1604
01:46:56,386 --> 01:47:02,335
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got elements of shamanism, which we have in pagan religions today.

1605
01:47:02,455 --> 01:47:11,328
[SPEAKER_02]: They have their light, which I'm assuming is... The way they've lined it up is close to an equivalent of Christianity and Judeo-Christian religions.

1606
01:47:12,049 --> 01:47:17,173
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they've got, you know, the devil worshippers.

1607
01:47:17,213 --> 01:47:19,195
[SPEAKER_02]: They have all kinds of different cults.

1608
01:47:19,875 --> 01:47:23,638
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but, you know, even apocalyptic cults, which we've got apocalyptic cults here.

1609
01:47:23,718 --> 01:47:28,682
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, how many of those people poisoned themselves to get on the giant spaceship on Halley's Comet, you know, whatever.

1610
01:47:28,942 --> 01:47:29,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

1611
01:47:29,803 --> 01:47:30,243
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that wasn't.

1612
01:47:30,303 --> 01:47:31,024
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Hail Bop.

1613
01:47:31,244 --> 01:47:31,584
[SPEAKER_02]: Hail Bop.

1614
01:47:31,604 --> 01:47:32,124
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1615
01:47:32,144 --> 01:47:32,665
[SPEAKER_08]: That whole thing.

1616
01:47:33,045 --> 01:47:34,226
[SPEAKER_08]: The freaky guy on the TV.

1617
01:47:34,506 --> 01:47:34,886
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1618
01:47:34,926 --> 01:47:36,067
[SPEAKER_07]: I blame Oom Bop for that.

1619
01:47:36,167 --> 01:47:36,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Shut up.

1620
01:47:37,328 --> 01:48:03,031
[SPEAKER_02]: but I mean my point is just using that I mean clearly a lot of the religions in that game are parallels for types of religions you have those archetypes you know and then you've got like say Final Fantasy 7 here's an example you've got the Cetra and their earth religion you know the soul of the planet that type of thing

1621
01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:07,631
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just an example.

1622
01:48:08,751 --> 01:48:18,994
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not so much that they're mimicking real religions, it's so much that they've created their own mythology based off of what each culture that's made this game understands of other religions.

1623
01:48:19,854 --> 01:48:23,815
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the same goes into, you know, different anime, TV shows, you name it.

1624
01:48:24,795 --> 01:48:25,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Weiland has an interesting point.

1625
01:48:26,016 --> 01:48:27,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Tekken has an angel and a devil in it.

1626
01:48:28,978 --> 01:48:30,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's also supposed to be genetic, too.

1627
01:48:31,119 --> 01:48:34,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Xenocore says half the Final Fantasies have that theme, almost anything from Japan.

1628
01:48:34,421 --> 01:48:35,942
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, like the whole spirituality.

1629
01:48:36,382 --> 01:48:37,683
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's another idea.

1630
01:48:37,983 --> 01:48:44,546
[SPEAKER_02]: For anyone who was an old Saturn gamer like me, there was Black Matrix that was based off of Hell mythology.

1631
01:48:46,047 --> 01:48:46,247
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1632
01:48:49,009 --> 01:48:58,038
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100 Matt says if you had the money to buy three arcade machines for yourself what would they be?

1633
01:48:58,359 --> 01:49:03,264
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought this question came up last week but it was the show that Jason and Alan were on so let's hear it from you guys.

1634
01:49:03,704 --> 01:49:05,746
[SPEAKER_08]: What three arcade machines would you buy?

1635
01:49:06,447 --> 01:49:10,591
[SPEAKER_08]: For me, BurgerTime, Magic Sword, Spy Hunter.

1636
01:49:12,714 --> 01:49:16,356
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, an Ultra Kade, a Mame, and no.

1637
01:49:17,217 --> 01:49:17,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheater.

1638
01:49:17,917 --> 01:49:18,177
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1639
01:49:21,519 --> 01:49:32,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Since I'm going to lump Pinball into Arcade, I'm going to say that I would get probably a Tekken 5, just because I really liked that game.

1640
01:49:33,586 --> 01:49:41,831
[SPEAKER_02]: I would get a Strider, and then I would probably get maybe a Theater of Magic, Pinball, or Black Rose.

1641
01:49:42,776 --> 01:49:43,137
[SPEAKER_08]: and DarkSakura.

1642
01:49:55,932 --> 01:49:56,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

1643
01:49:56,772 --> 01:50:00,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is easy because I already have an arcade machine at home.

1644
01:50:01,976 --> 01:50:05,819
[SPEAKER_07]: The three that I can't get right now, we'll do... Let's see.

1645
01:50:06,420 --> 01:50:14,065
[SPEAKER_07]: Fourth Mix Plus, a Max 2, and whatever the newest DDR game they have out there.

1646
01:50:14,626 --> 01:50:18,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it something versus Dance Ice Revolution Second Mix or something?

1647
01:50:19,369 --> 01:50:19,750
[SPEAKER_07]: One of those.

1648
01:50:20,110 --> 01:50:21,111
[SPEAKER_07]: So three DDR machines.

1649
01:50:21,131 --> 01:50:21,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1650
01:50:21,531 --> 01:50:23,071
[SPEAKER_08]: You won three DDR machines in your house.

1651
01:50:23,091 --> 01:50:23,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they're all different.

1652
01:50:23,972 --> 01:50:26,592
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you know, Max 2 is pretty awesome in its own right.

1653
01:50:26,993 --> 01:50:31,934
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, 4th Mix Plus is pretty awesome.

1654
01:50:32,054 --> 01:50:36,055
[SPEAKER_07]: And the new game, I haven't played the new DDR game, but that might be pretty cool.

1655
01:50:36,555 --> 01:50:38,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Tiger Call, the ferret is actually at my house.

1656
01:50:39,406 --> 01:50:41,789
[SPEAKER_07]: X3 vs. Second Mix, says the chatroom.

1657
01:50:42,049 --> 01:50:43,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, X3 vs. Second Mix.

1658
01:50:43,931 --> 01:50:44,852
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I'll be getting.

1659
01:50:44,932 --> 01:50:45,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Three questions left.

1660
01:50:46,393 --> 01:50:55,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Legend of Zaku says, looking back, if Konami quickly and directly followed up with a successor to DDR Extreme 10 years ago instead of Supernova...

1661
01:50:56,192 --> 01:51:02,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think it would have created a different rhythm game community than what it turned out due to ITG taking that place?

1662
01:51:04,436 --> 01:51:05,716
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a loaded question.

1663
01:51:05,936 --> 01:51:08,317
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think ITG ever truly took its place.

1664
01:51:08,878 --> 01:51:16,201
[SPEAKER_08]: ITG caused controversy and kind of splintered the community into a couple kind of different sects, if you will.

1665
01:51:17,222 --> 01:51:18,022
[SPEAKER_08]: I said sects.

1666
01:51:18,942 --> 01:51:22,804
[SPEAKER_08]: There was the pro-ITG crowd and the anti-ITG crowd, the DDR loyalists.

1667
01:51:22,824 --> 01:51:26,425
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how I feel about it in regards to the ITG thing.

1668
01:51:26,885 --> 01:51:33,708
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, if you were at a restaurant and then a dog took a shit on the sidewalk, would that make a decision about which place you would go to eat?

1669
01:51:34,954 --> 01:51:38,956
[SPEAKER_08]: I think what needed to happen is, yes, Konami needed to put something out a lot sooner than they did.

1670
01:51:39,636 --> 01:51:44,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Konami failed because Konami of Japan refused to take risks.

1671
01:51:45,399 --> 01:51:48,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Jason Enos forced them to take a risk here in America.

1672
01:51:48,680 --> 01:51:50,041
[SPEAKER_08]: I shouldn't say force, but you know what I mean.

1673
01:51:50,081 --> 01:51:55,983
[SPEAKER_08]: He pestered and pestered and did the professional version of that for years and years until Konami finally released something over here.

1674
01:51:56,563 --> 01:51:57,524
[SPEAKER_08]: When he left Konami...

1675
01:51:58,837 --> 01:52:27,636
[SPEAKER_08]: and they shut down Konami Hawaii who was doing a great job with the Xbox games when they shut down Konami in the Bay Area where the fans were making steps and you know all that stuff I think it lost a lot too much to recover from so honestly a little weird now seeing like some of these step mania artists and stuff like that or people that would make music for step mania and DWI and stuff like that actually as artists in the game it's a little odd neat but a little odd

1676
01:52:27,856 --> 01:52:28,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Two questions left.

1677
01:52:28,837 --> 01:52:32,619
[SPEAKER_08]: I do have to give another shout out here because I noticed our Ustream count is increasing.

1678
01:52:32,879 --> 01:52:34,280
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not a usual thing for us.

1679
01:52:34,821 --> 01:52:36,062
[SPEAKER_08]: We are using this as a backup.

1680
01:52:36,182 --> 01:52:40,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Our main feed at All Games Radio, which ironically it was to be our last night on All Games Radio.

1681
01:52:40,505 --> 01:52:42,006
[SPEAKER_08]: It died partway through.

1682
01:52:42,326 --> 01:52:45,008
[SPEAKER_08]: I am still showing feeding to All Games Radio.

1683
01:52:45,308 --> 01:52:46,889
[SPEAKER_08]: So their server's down or something.

1684
01:52:47,249 --> 01:52:49,691
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyhow, that's beside the point.

1685
01:52:50,091 --> 01:53:03,552
[SPEAKER_08]: you can't shut us up that easy so here we are on Ustream if you want to join us in the chat room chat.orangeloungeradio.com it's a radio show that's why you're looking at my Tron figurine on the camera alright moving on two questions remain Xenocore

1686
01:53:04,705 --> 01:53:10,609
[SPEAKER_08]: What game have you resisted playing the most but been the most pleasantly surprised by?

1687
01:53:10,949 --> 01:53:15,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Xenocore, you couldn't have given me an easier question because it's going on right now.

1688
01:53:15,412 --> 01:53:15,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Mass Effect.

1689
01:53:16,533 --> 01:53:19,115
[SPEAKER_08]: I wrote it off originally as, oh, this isn't my type of game.

1690
01:53:19,375 --> 01:53:20,876
[SPEAKER_08]: This is like a first-person shooter.

1691
01:53:21,176 --> 01:53:27,220
[SPEAKER_08]: I watched a friend play it, and I saw the most boring parts of the game driving the Mako around, and I was like, eh, not the game for me.

1692
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:31,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Finally, Shane basically threatened to kill me if I didn't play it.

1693
01:53:31,223 --> 01:53:31,783
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, fine.

1694
01:53:31,984 --> 01:53:33,164
[SPEAKER_08]: He's very good at bullying me.

1695
01:53:33,845 --> 01:53:34,946
[SPEAKER_08]: So I said, fine, I'll play it.

1696
01:53:34,966 --> 01:53:36,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Rob, you should play Mass Effect.

1697
01:53:37,007 --> 01:53:37,508
[SPEAKER_08]: Pretty much.

1698
01:53:38,068 --> 01:53:38,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like that, too.

1699
01:53:38,689 --> 01:53:39,710
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my Shane impression.

1700
01:53:39,830 --> 01:53:50,838
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know, because he'll do that and tell you to do something, but then when he fights with you, when he fights with you, no, Rob, you gotta play the... He'll totally do the little boyfriend.

1701
01:53:50,858 --> 01:53:54,241
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I see this, fine, I don't care if you play it or not.

1702
01:53:54,361 --> 01:53:54,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Stare.

1703
01:53:57,543 --> 01:54:05,787
[SPEAKER_08]: so regardless of you know the catalyst Mass Effect I started playing and I absolutely love it and I think it's a fantastic series Jamie anything for you here?

1704
01:54:05,807 --> 01:54:18,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Cave Story oh that's true it was out for years and years and we just kind of go oh little well I had known about Cave Story like forever and I even actually played some of the old version of it when it was you know like a flash download or something

1705
01:54:19,213 --> 01:54:27,142
[SPEAKER_02]: or I play different incarnations of Cave Story and then just starting to play it again and Dan though, he was really into it.

1706
01:54:27,563 --> 01:54:29,625
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's like, I'm going to play your Cave Story when you're not here.

1707
01:54:30,145 --> 01:54:30,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Fine, play it.

1708
01:54:31,227 --> 01:54:31,847
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get the points.

1709
01:54:32,708 --> 01:54:33,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, anything you can think of?

1710
01:54:33,770 --> 01:54:34,971
[SPEAKER_08]: A series you wrote off originally?

1711
01:54:36,371 --> 01:55:01,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Call of Duty Modern Warfare I knew it Honestly, because I played it once I was like, eh, I don't really like this as much as I like the World War 2 ones I'm not going to really play this and then went back and it was awesome so, you know, gung-ho into that I don't know Yeah, that's pretty much it I guess Alright, last question from Derek H

1712
01:55:02,898 --> 01:55:09,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Question, when women say the good ones are always taken, does that mean if you're still single you're not a good one?

1713
01:55:12,637 --> 01:55:14,599
[SPEAKER_08]: I always heard the good ones are always gay.

1714
01:55:14,739 --> 01:55:15,960
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I always heard.

1715
01:55:17,241 --> 01:55:18,322
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm always like, that's right.

1716
01:55:19,543 --> 01:55:24,108
[SPEAKER_02]: I was never really in that opinion, you know, because I was like, fuck, I don't want anybody.

1717
01:55:24,508 --> 01:55:27,491
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I met Dan and I was like, well, fine, I guess you'll do.

1718
01:55:28,111 --> 01:55:30,213
[SPEAKER_02]: No, my husband is the best.

1719
01:55:30,674 --> 01:55:31,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you ever caught yourself saying that?

1720
01:55:32,095 --> 01:55:33,216
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you're the woman on this show.

1721
01:55:33,556 --> 01:55:37,240
[SPEAKER_02]: No, honestly, I haven't because I mean, I've never had a trouble getting a date.

1722
01:55:38,790 --> 01:55:52,187
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why, I guess, you know, because I've always, I mean, I always thought that I was kind of this undateable geek chick, you know, but I've never really had a problem getting, you know, getting anyone to date me, I guess.

1723
01:55:52,527 --> 01:55:52,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1724
01:55:52,948 --> 01:55:53,689
[SPEAKER_02]: But, what?

1725
01:55:54,349 --> 01:55:55,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Can't, never mind.

1726
01:55:56,011 --> 01:55:59,092
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, but, you know... Can't say anything inappropriate to that.

1727
01:55:59,872 --> 01:56:00,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop.

1728
01:56:00,192 --> 01:56:04,733
[SPEAKER_02]: No, well, I'm going to go ahead and say this out loud in public.

1729
01:56:04,773 --> 01:56:05,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan was my first and only.

1730
01:56:06,593 --> 01:56:07,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

1731
01:56:07,874 --> 01:56:10,034
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, not that I haven't made out with a bunch of people, but still.

1732
01:56:11,994 --> 01:56:18,596
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, Dan happened to be the right person at the right time, and he's always been the right person, so I've never...

1733
01:56:19,377 --> 01:56:22,382
[SPEAKER_02]: It's never been a case of why are all the good ones taken.

1734
01:56:22,502 --> 01:56:25,187
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been, why do all these guys suck?

1735
01:56:25,868 --> 01:56:27,251
[SPEAKER_02]: And oh, someone who doesn't suck.

1736
01:56:28,092 --> 01:56:30,096
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what my experience is.

1737
01:56:31,213 --> 01:56:39,837
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if you find this to be the case or not, but I think a lot of times when somebody finds the one, you're kind of surprised a little bit at it.

1738
01:56:40,097 --> 01:56:44,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, I never thought it would be this or whatever.

1739
01:56:44,339 --> 01:56:48,300
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think a lot of times women or anybody, I mean, I've heard gay guys that say that too.

1740
01:56:48,460 --> 01:56:49,721
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's not just women that say it.

1741
01:56:49,761 --> 01:56:51,762
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard a lot of people say that, that the good ones are always taken.

1742
01:56:52,282 --> 01:56:53,643
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think, you know, it just means...

1743
01:56:54,983 --> 01:57:10,254
[SPEAKER_08]: my radar isn't pinging off because I'm very tunnel vision to what I'm looking for and I have written all over my notepad what I want my dream boy to be like and everything that's shoved at me in the media I'm very tunnel vision and then it's like oh shit I just fucking fell in love

1744
01:57:11,916 --> 01:57:21,829
[SPEAKER_08]: And even though it's not a woman-man situation, Alan I knew for years online never would have thought I'd end up with him, moving in with him and all that stuff.

1745
01:57:21,849 --> 01:57:23,451
[SPEAKER_08]: But it just happened.

1746
01:57:23,491 --> 01:57:24,972
[SPEAKER_08]: And when it happened, it was kind of one of those things.

1747
01:57:25,934 --> 01:57:27,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew Dan online for years.

1748
01:57:27,436 --> 01:57:27,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1749
01:57:27,996 --> 01:57:37,583
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is, you know, when I was in Alabama and had no, I was actually saving up my money to go to Anime Expo, which is the money that I use for my plane ticket to fly out here in the first place.

1750
01:57:38,423 --> 01:57:43,146
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I mean, I had known Dan forever online and it just happened.

1751
01:57:43,947 --> 01:57:44,267
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean.

1752
01:57:45,908 --> 01:57:53,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Techness says, it's because the women who say that are usually dating assholes in our chat room at chat.orangeonradio.com I was always dating nice guys.

1753
01:57:55,548 --> 01:57:59,453
[SPEAKER_02]: I had broken up with every guy that I had gone out with because he was too nice

1754
01:58:13,909 --> 01:58:21,696
[SPEAKER_02]: I went as someone who would argue with me and not treat me like I was, you know, made of fragile eggshell and porcelain.

1755
01:58:22,296 --> 01:58:23,377
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dan doesn't treat me like that.

1756
01:58:23,417 --> 01:58:28,661
[SPEAKER_02]: He treats me like I'm an equal and like I'm his partner, not just, you know, his woman.

1757
01:58:28,801 --> 01:58:29,302
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

1758
01:58:30,783 --> 01:58:31,003
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

1759
01:58:31,664 --> 01:58:31,924
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1760
01:58:32,564 --> 01:58:35,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, I was going to say, because you're in the friend zone, that's why they say that.

1761
01:58:35,707 --> 01:58:37,168
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why you hear that.

1762
01:58:37,248 --> 01:58:37,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the friend zone.

1763
01:58:38,229 --> 01:58:41,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they can discuss these woman to woman things with you.

1764
01:58:42,866 --> 01:58:44,114
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say something else.

1765
01:58:45,948 --> 01:59:15,253
[SPEAKER_02]: I have had guys come back and say they were interested and I'll flat out evaluate would I have dated this person and for the most part I can safely say no like I'm not going to name names but there was someone who said he was interested in me until he found out I was married and I just flat out said well not to be a bitch about this but I wouldn't have gone out with you and this is why I wouldn't have gone out with you so if I'm the kind of person that you're looking for this is why I wouldn't have gone out with you you know what I'm saying

1766
01:59:16,860 --> 01:59:17,401
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I do.

1767
01:59:18,321 --> 01:59:20,223
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's very helpful for those guys.

1768
01:59:22,245 --> 01:59:23,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop being neurotic.

1769
01:59:23,306 --> 01:59:23,566
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1770
01:59:25,027 --> 01:59:25,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for the questions, guys.

1771
01:59:26,008 --> 01:59:27,829
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to move on with some video game news.

1772
01:59:28,270 --> 01:59:32,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Before we do, I have to notice, one other thing I just noted was still in the shrink wrap, going back to that earlier question.

1773
01:59:32,794 --> 01:59:33,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at this.

1774
01:59:33,434 --> 01:59:37,838
[SPEAKER_08]: I have the PlayStation Vita little ARG cards, the AR play cards.

1775
01:59:38,158 --> 01:59:38,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Haven't taken them out.

1776
01:59:39,119 --> 01:59:41,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Good, because you haven't figured out that the AR is broken.

1777
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:42,280
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it really?

1778
01:59:42,520 --> 01:59:42,920
[SPEAKER_07]: It sucks.

1779
01:59:42,940 --> 01:59:44,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Well here, I have a use for them now.

1780
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:47,341
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll put them on the Ustream cam since we suddenly have a video feed tonight.

1781
01:59:47,381 --> 01:59:47,921
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

1782
01:59:48,021 --> 01:59:49,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Good job.

1783
01:59:49,301 --> 01:59:50,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at the cards.

1784
01:59:50,441 --> 01:59:54,222
[SPEAKER_02]: You should put Loki's kind of dried out looking pizza up there next.

1785
01:59:54,262 --> 01:59:56,283
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, it's terrible.

1786
01:59:56,323 --> 02:00:01,644
[SPEAKER_07]: I tried playing the soccer game and I spent like 15 minutes trying to get that damn thing to work.

1787
02:00:02,504 --> 02:00:02,664
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1788
02:00:02,964 --> 02:00:05,644
[SPEAKER_07]: And I played the fireworks game and I was like, nope, don't care.

1789
02:00:06,365 --> 02:00:08,045
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, it's a waste of time.

1790
02:00:08,425 --> 02:00:13,250
[SPEAKER_07]: It's neat, but you know, I need like an actual AR game that doesn't require cards.

1791
02:00:13,450 --> 02:00:15,332
[SPEAKER_07]: And that works, you know, that'd be nice if it worked.

1792
02:00:16,493 --> 02:00:16,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Just saying.

1793
02:00:18,315 --> 02:00:19,816
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's move on with some more gaming news.

1794
02:00:19,896 --> 02:00:21,558
[SPEAKER_08]: The mailbag coming up shortly here in a moment.

1795
02:00:21,738 --> 02:00:22,379
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, Loki.

1796
02:00:22,619 --> 02:00:25,322
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, let's talk a little bit about Sony.

1797
02:00:25,762 --> 02:00:30,787
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mean, I guess they kind of need to have like a,

1798
02:00:32,657 --> 02:00:34,318
[SPEAKER_07]: and their own Smash Bros.

1799
02:00:34,358 --> 02:00:34,879
[SPEAKER_07]: type game.

1800
02:00:34,899 --> 02:00:35,639
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, hey, why not?

1801
02:00:35,679 --> 02:00:36,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone else is doing it.

1802
02:00:36,920 --> 02:00:44,505
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yes, there was a rumor, of course, that they were putting out some sort of game that was going to feature all the PlayStation All-Stars and that kind of stuff.

1803
02:00:44,865 --> 02:00:49,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, now they've actually registered a domain called PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale.

1804
02:00:50,048 --> 02:00:52,550
[SPEAKER_07]: And it is looking to be like that game.

1805
02:00:52,710 --> 02:00:58,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Something with maybe all their first-party franchise characters from Heavenly Sword to God of War.

1806
02:00:58,553 --> 02:01:00,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, Heavenly Sword, is anyone really going to remember that game?

1807
02:01:01,615 --> 02:01:02,195
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.

1808
02:01:03,156 --> 02:01:05,597
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're going to have all these different characters fighting each other.

1809
02:01:06,877 --> 02:01:09,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe in some sort of Smash Brothers type way.

1810
02:01:10,719 --> 02:01:13,020
[SPEAKER_07]: Originally, I guess it was on the working title, Title Fight.

1811
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:20,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Rumored to be announced actually this week on Spike TV's The Game Trailers TV show.

1812
02:01:21,303 --> 02:01:21,963
[SPEAKER_07]: When's that show on?

1813
02:01:22,083 --> 02:01:22,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Thursday.

1814
02:01:23,704 --> 02:01:48,625
[SPEAKER_07]: so uh i guess we'll find out this week if that's the case most likely probably going to be the case um so neat i guess um i i don't know it's just cool we'll see how this really kind of works well i mean obviously they're gonna kind of take the successful super smash brothers format and put their own spin on it i mean it's

1815
02:01:49,896 --> 02:01:53,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I don't know if they have quite the recognizable lineup of characters.

1816
02:01:53,297 --> 02:01:58,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I don't even think I can really throw that kind of shade at it because, you know, there are some big, big characters there.

1817
02:01:58,819 --> 02:02:03,180
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like I don't see how... I mean, like, there's no... At least it's not a kart racing game.

1818
02:02:03,941 --> 02:02:05,041
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a little big planet for that.

1819
02:02:05,761 --> 02:02:06,421
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's the thing.

1820
02:02:06,461 --> 02:02:08,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, Nintendo, you know, Smash Bros.

1821
02:02:09,022 --> 02:02:13,604
[SPEAKER_07]: makes sense because there's really no M-rated characters in Nintendo's kind of lineup there.

1822
02:02:13,624 --> 02:02:14,404
[SPEAKER_07]: They're all kind of that...

1823
02:02:14,924 --> 02:02:15,946
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

1824
02:02:35,131 --> 02:03:01,561
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they need to have first off Kevin Butler needs to be a playable character as is also the creepy baby from their commercials needs to be a character as well that would be awesome but yes I wonder if they'll get any crossover things you know kind of like how they finally got like Snake and Smash Brothers and Sonic and some of that you think any of that will happen

1825
02:03:01,820 --> 02:03:03,281
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100 Matt says, can we kill that Marcus PSP kid?

1826
02:03:03,301 --> 02:03:03,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Psst.

1827
02:03:26,381 --> 02:03:29,584
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be hilarious, but no, it's probably not going to be the case.

1828
02:03:30,104 --> 02:03:32,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, EA story.

1829
02:03:32,926 --> 02:03:34,767
[SPEAKER_08]: Very controversial company these days.

1830
02:03:38,130 --> 02:03:50,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Eurogamer had a report this week that in the UK, EA person Keith Ramsdale, one of the executives at EA, announced that EA is going to develop an online universe for all its franchises.

1831
02:03:50,839 --> 02:03:56,361
[SPEAKER_08]: He didn't say multiplayer necessarily, but a cross-platform major tie-in approach to games.

1832
02:03:57,342 --> 02:03:59,763
[SPEAKER_08]: And basically pulling in any gadget you can think of.

1833
02:03:59,883 --> 02:04:01,503
[SPEAKER_08]: iPhone, Xbox, whatever.

1834
02:04:01,624 --> 02:04:02,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Flipo grenade!

1835
02:04:02,604 --> 02:04:07,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Quote, Imagine a player gets up in the morning, plays an online match on his 360 before going to work.

1836
02:04:07,666 --> 02:04:10,767
[SPEAKER_08]: On the bus on his way to work, he practices his free kicks on his tablet.

1837
02:04:11,368 --> 02:04:13,929
[SPEAKER_08]: At lunch, he looks on the transfer window on his PC.

1838
02:04:14,229 --> 02:04:16,290
[SPEAKER_08]: On the way home, he chooses his kit on the smartphone.

1839
02:04:16,670 --> 02:04:18,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the thing, when he gets home to play again on his 360 that evening...

1840
02:04:19,911 --> 02:04:25,136
[SPEAKER_07]: He finds out his account's been hacked and the people have charged FIFA DLC points to them.

1841
02:04:25,417 --> 02:04:25,717
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1842
02:04:28,800 --> 02:04:31,483
[SPEAKER_08]: All those achievements and upgrade will be alive in his game.

1843
02:04:31,783 --> 02:04:32,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the thing.

1844
02:04:32,544 --> 02:04:37,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so as much as EA's talking about this unified network, you know, I kind of thought this was already happening.

1845
02:04:37,509 --> 02:04:43,194
[SPEAKER_08]: And EA had a very our way or the highway mentality and that's how they got away with a lot of stuff on the Xbox.

1846
02:04:43,614 --> 02:04:43,875
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean...

1847
02:04:45,336 --> 02:04:53,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Even the way I bought Mass Effect 2 DLC, you kind of had to go online and tie in the Cerberus account online, and then that opens up the DLC.

1848
02:04:53,599 --> 02:04:56,760
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was ridiculous, but EA is being very possessive about it.

1849
02:04:56,800 --> 02:05:05,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, they want it that way so that you have to buy your fucking online passes for every game because they're like, shit, this offline game, how are we going to sell an online pass for it?

1850
02:05:05,584 --> 02:05:09,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, yeah, that may have worked once with Kingdoms of Amal or Reckoning, but people are going to start...

1851
02:05:10,086 --> 02:05:10,867
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1852
02:05:30,965 --> 02:05:32,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Ghost Recon Future Soldier, Call of Duty Elite,

1853
02:05:47,825 --> 02:05:58,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, honestly, is it really going to take, what, like five seconds to configure your fucking soccer player or whatever when you get home?

1854
02:05:58,727 --> 02:06:12,070
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, do you really have to bring... Well, of course, I guess if you're this type of guy that brings your fucking tablet and phone to work with you and shit, then I guess you want to get shit done right away, but...

1855
02:06:14,065 --> 02:06:14,385
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1856
02:06:14,425 --> 02:06:15,485
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a little excessive.

1857
02:06:16,066 --> 02:06:20,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool if they're going to do that, but once again, I think it's just to sell those online passes.

1858
02:06:21,467 --> 02:06:23,308
[SPEAKER_07]: If it adds value, then neat.

1859
02:06:26,789 --> 02:06:28,529
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they've done that also with Need for Speed.

1860
02:06:28,889 --> 02:06:31,850
[SPEAKER_07]: They had their auto log or something like that.

1861
02:06:34,511 --> 02:06:35,611
[SPEAKER_07]: They're kind of already doing this.

1862
02:06:36,963 --> 02:06:38,104
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the way everything's going.

1863
02:06:38,124 --> 02:06:41,607
[SPEAKER_07]: They need to have some way to drive people to keep playing their games.

1864
02:06:43,148 --> 02:06:43,909
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess.

1865
02:06:44,469 --> 02:06:44,909
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess.

1866
02:06:45,710 --> 02:06:49,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so you get to hear the same music, theme music again because it doubles for the mailbag music.

1867
02:06:50,234 --> 02:06:58,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Every week you guys send us emails at mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and DarkSakura dives into the email bag head first and pulls out some emails she thinks she ought to share with the rest of us.

1868
02:07:00,897 --> 02:07:04,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, now this is from April 12th, so disclaimers and everything, blah blah.

1869
02:07:05,819 --> 02:07:13,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I haven't heard a lot about Assassin's Creed on the show, and I was wondering why it isn't a big subject on here.

1870
02:07:13,501 --> 02:07:18,963
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a stellar series, and I really think the story is underestimated by its gameplay being the main attraction.

1871
02:07:19,083 --> 02:07:19,843
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think?

1872
02:07:20,063 --> 02:07:23,504
[SPEAKER_07]: There's another game series that I play, and I'm like, fuck this, I'm not playing this anymore.

1873
02:07:23,724 --> 02:07:23,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?

1874
02:07:23,964 --> 02:07:24,465
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't like it?

1875
02:07:24,645 --> 02:07:25,685
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't like Assassin's Creed.

1876
02:07:25,925 --> 02:07:27,887
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard a lot of good things about it.

1877
02:07:28,208 --> 02:07:36,318
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of Mass Effect to me, where I saw it really quickly and I was like, ooh, I'm playing too much WoW right now to get into Assassin's Creed.

1878
02:07:36,618 --> 02:07:37,980
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a lot of friends that are really into it.

1879
02:07:38,080 --> 02:07:43,026
[SPEAKER_08]: It is on my list to get to at some point, but, you know, we can't play everything.

1880
02:07:43,286 --> 02:07:43,706
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying.

1881
02:08:13,743 --> 02:08:14,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Next email.

1882
02:08:14,464 --> 02:08:15,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that was from Danny.

1883
02:08:16,065 --> 02:08:16,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Next email.

1884
02:08:17,425 --> 02:08:18,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, Sterlach here.

1885
02:08:18,486 --> 02:08:19,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome back.

1886
02:08:19,166 --> 02:08:25,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I was listening to some random video game soundtracks the other day and had an interesting thought for a possible topic to talk about.

1887
02:08:25,590 --> 02:08:27,311
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm curious what your answer will be.

1888
02:08:27,792 --> 02:08:34,256
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems that sometimes that random game will come along that completely sucks but can defy all logic by having a kickass soundtrack.

1889
02:08:35,016 --> 02:08:40,763
[SPEAKER_02]: The two that jumped to my mind right away are Unlimited Saga for PS2 and Spider-Man and the X-Men Arcade's Revenge on the SNES.

1890
02:08:41,404 --> 02:08:44,087
[SPEAKER_02]: What games do you think of that will fit this criteria?

1891
02:08:44,267 --> 02:08:47,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously opinion-based, but curious what you guys come up with.

1892
02:08:47,714 --> 02:08:52,698
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why, but my mind goes very, very old school, and one of the first games I think of was Goonies 2.

1893
02:08:54,139 --> 02:08:57,761
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why, and the NES had a stellar soundtrack for the 8-bit days.

1894
02:08:57,982 --> 02:08:58,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

1895
02:08:58,982 --> 02:09:00,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, Dan really loves that game.

1896
02:09:00,744 --> 02:09:02,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but the game itself was, eh.

1897
02:09:03,145 --> 02:09:09,330
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it takes some getting into, but then once you really do get into it, you're like, wow, this game, I don't give this game enough credit.

1898
02:09:09,870 --> 02:09:13,313
[SPEAKER_08]: But that was really where the soundtrack was so good, I had to play more of it.

1899
02:09:14,235 --> 02:09:19,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I liked, even, I'm not going to say it was a bad game, but it just wasn't that in-depth.

1900
02:09:19,378 --> 02:09:19,998
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't that hard.

1901
02:09:20,038 --> 02:09:24,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Strider 2 had a fantastic soundtrack, but really easy gameplay.

1902
02:09:25,341 --> 02:09:27,622
[SPEAKER_02]: But for me, a lot of it was just how awesome the music was.

1903
02:09:27,662 --> 02:09:28,762
[SPEAKER_02]: And oh my gosh, Strider, here are you.

1904
02:09:29,263 --> 02:09:30,123
[SPEAKER_08]: I got a great answer for this.

1905
02:09:30,223 --> 02:09:30,483
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1906
02:09:30,523 --> 02:09:31,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Final Fantasy Mystic Quest.

1907
02:09:32,264 --> 02:09:32,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1908
02:09:32,844 --> 02:09:34,665
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of a crap RPG.

1909
02:09:34,685 --> 02:09:35,666
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's all right.

1910
02:09:35,706 --> 02:09:36,366
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got a decent story.

1911
02:09:36,566 --> 02:09:38,407
[SPEAKER_08]: But the soundtrack was so good.

1912
02:09:38,747 --> 02:09:40,428
[SPEAKER_08]: And it wasn't no buimatsu either.

1913
02:09:41,089 --> 02:09:42,429
[SPEAKER_08]: People are going to poop on me for this.

1914
02:09:42,669 --> 02:09:42,889
[SPEAKER_08]: But?

1915
02:09:42,909 --> 02:09:43,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Paperboy.

1916
02:09:43,530 --> 02:09:43,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Paperboy.

1917
02:09:45,205 --> 02:09:47,185
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like Paperboy, but I love the music in it.

1918
02:09:49,606 --> 02:09:50,066
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see that.

1919
02:09:51,306 --> 02:09:52,487
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought it was funny.

1920
02:09:52,607 --> 02:09:53,047
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see that.

1921
02:09:53,907 --> 02:09:55,127
[SPEAKER_02]: I really am not any good at Paperboy.

1922
02:09:55,147 --> 02:09:56,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Paperboy is a weird-ass game.

1923
02:09:56,747 --> 02:09:59,808
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, but I love watching other people play it.

1924
02:09:59,848 --> 02:10:01,548
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the thing, but I hate playing it myself.

1925
02:10:04,349 --> 02:10:06,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Actdeft in our chatroom says, Sonic games.

1926
02:10:09,410 --> 02:10:11,230
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Sonic Adventure 2 had a good soundtrack.

1927
02:10:11,550 --> 02:10:12,511
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything you can think of, Loki?

1928
02:10:12,571 --> 02:10:14,331
[SPEAKER_07]: A stall on the Sega Saturn.

1929
02:10:15,596 --> 02:10:16,858
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a random pick.

1930
02:10:18,019 --> 02:10:19,381
[SPEAKER_07]: I love it.

1931
02:10:19,561 --> 02:10:20,662
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a great soundtrack.

1932
02:10:20,722 --> 02:10:29,032
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually recorded on my cassette tape because I played the music on the Saturn when I rented the console to play the game.

1933
02:10:29,887 --> 02:10:30,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Hell yeah!

1934
02:10:47,028 --> 02:11:14,305
[SPEAKER_02]: but Crazy Taxi was kind of a crappy game but it's that song or the combination of Offspring and Bad Religion it just wasn't the same which were two bands I was so into when that game came out I freaking love Bad Religion there was another game that just popped into my head and then it popped out the moment you said Crazy Taxi so you know

1935
02:11:17,210 --> 02:11:19,272
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say the PlayStation version of Grandia.

1936
02:11:21,133 --> 02:11:24,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I was playing it on the Genesis because the Genesis version is so much better.

1937
02:11:25,116 --> 02:11:28,318
[SPEAKER_02]: But I still tried to play it on the PlayStation just so I could hear the good music.

1938
02:11:28,538 --> 02:11:29,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, come on over.

1939
02:11:29,739 --> 02:11:31,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Have some fun with Crazy Taxi.

1940
02:11:37,905 --> 02:11:39,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's run over some bitches.

1941
02:11:39,646 --> 02:11:42,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, you're driving too fast.

1942
02:11:42,928 --> 02:11:43,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

1943
02:11:45,110 --> 02:11:46,210
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what I'm doing.

1944
02:11:49,298 --> 02:11:53,019
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that song was already big before Crazy Taxi.

1945
02:11:53,059 --> 02:11:54,479
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember that song in high school and stuff.

1946
02:11:54,880 --> 02:12:00,901
[SPEAKER_08]: And then when that game came out, that song will forever be associated with Crazy Taxi.

1947
02:12:01,621 --> 02:12:02,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I know another game.

1948
02:12:02,842 --> 02:12:07,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because I liked the music in it, believe it or not, was that stupid Avatar game.

1949
02:12:10,249 --> 02:12:11,151
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you're on your own there.

1950
02:12:11,291 --> 02:12:15,877
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was going back and watching the cutscenes from Tron Evolution, and that was good music.

1951
02:12:16,538 --> 02:12:17,099
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll give you that.

1952
02:12:17,239 --> 02:12:18,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, I mean, it was pretty much the Daft Punk stuff.

1953
02:12:19,422 --> 02:12:19,723
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah.

1954
02:12:20,444 --> 02:12:20,664
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1955
02:12:21,185 --> 02:12:21,645
[SPEAKER_08]: More emails?

1956
02:12:22,366 --> 02:12:22,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1957
02:12:22,887 --> 02:12:23,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1958
02:12:24,349 --> 02:12:26,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me go ahead and close the one from our friend Sterlok.

1959
02:12:28,672 --> 02:12:29,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi gang!

1960
02:12:30,013 --> 02:12:35,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you had an awesome time at Electronica last week.

1961
02:12:35,698 --> 02:12:35,938
[SPEAKER_02]: I did.

1962
02:12:36,718 --> 02:12:36,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Bitch.

1963
02:12:38,320 --> 02:12:39,440
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for my Duffy outfit.

1964
02:12:39,841 --> 02:12:40,221
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome.

1965
02:12:41,042 --> 02:12:50,369
[SPEAKER_02]: While you lot were having fun, I didn't get to go, so it was just while Rob was having fun, I was forced to help my parents decide which of my childhood memories I wanted to destroy for all time.

1966
02:12:50,429 --> 02:12:50,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Hint none.

1967
02:12:51,290 --> 02:12:53,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Good lord, this sounds like a terrible reality show.

1968
02:12:55,081 --> 02:12:57,903
[SPEAKER_02]: While sorting through all my stuff, I found my old Master System 2.

1969
02:12:58,724 --> 02:13:08,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe because all the episodes of Game Center CX I've been watching, maybe it's the fact that you mentioned Castle of Illusion last time, but I felt like I had to plug it in and get me a fix of retro gaming.

1970
02:13:08,811 --> 02:13:13,294
[SPEAKER_02]: I was surprised that it still works perfectly and that I still remembered how to plug it in and tune the TV.

1971
02:13:13,834 --> 02:13:16,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Flicking through channels and suddenly I saw the Lo-Fi Sega appear.

1972
02:13:17,297 --> 02:13:18,738
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a heartwarming experience.

1973
02:13:18,798 --> 02:13:21,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait a minute, is Master System 2 what they call the Genesis overseas?

1974
02:13:22,529 --> 02:13:24,511
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1975
02:13:25,392 --> 02:13:28,336
[SPEAKER_02]: The Genesis was called the Mega Drive.

1976
02:13:28,376 --> 02:13:28,817
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

1977
02:13:28,857 --> 02:13:29,257
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

1978
02:13:29,598 --> 02:13:30,579
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like Castle of Illusion.

1979
02:13:30,619 --> 02:13:31,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Was that on the Master System?

1980
02:13:32,361 --> 02:13:33,182
[SPEAKER_02]: They did it in Brazil.

1981
02:13:34,043 --> 02:13:34,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, all right.

1982
02:13:35,046 --> 02:13:39,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I've never really been one for retro gaming.

1983
02:13:40,090 --> 02:13:44,054
[SPEAKER_02]: I got MS2 pretty late and missed the 16-bit era entirely.

1984
02:13:44,534 --> 02:13:46,716
[SPEAKER_02]: I never really grew up on video games in that way.

1985
02:13:47,056 --> 02:13:54,422
[SPEAKER_02]: But picking a game, blowing into the cartridge, and inserting it while imitating Arino's Game Center CX Ka-chow on was fun.

1986
02:13:54,482 --> 02:13:55,623
[SPEAKER_02]: I, of course, never seen that show.

1987
02:13:56,324 --> 02:13:59,407
[SPEAKER_02]: The games I used to play were pretty much exactly as I remembered them.

1988
02:13:59,607 --> 02:14:01,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Fun, uncomplicated, and pretty tough.

1989
02:14:02,749 --> 02:14:04,510
[SPEAKER_02]: They just all seemed charming.

1990
02:14:04,851 --> 02:14:08,533
[SPEAKER_02]: The old school graphics, the 8-bit music, all real undeniable charm.

1991
02:14:09,093 --> 02:14:13,096
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I found surprising was how slow the games felt, Sonic especially.

1992
02:14:13,536 --> 02:14:16,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe just a case of badly ported PAL games?

1993
02:14:17,199 --> 02:14:28,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I didn't get to spend too much time playing it, but I'd like to say it's thanks to you guys and GCCX that I really had a renewed interest in the pleasure of retro gaming.

1994
02:14:28,586 --> 02:14:31,228
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, OLR, and that's from the OLR.

1995
02:14:32,677 --> 02:14:32,958
[SPEAKER_02]: P.S.

1996
02:14:33,018 --> 02:14:38,050
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to retro gaming, do you prefer playing old games on a modern console is better than playing them on their original consoles?

1997
02:14:38,411 --> 02:14:38,832
[SPEAKER_02]: P.P.S.

1998
02:14:38,872 --> 02:14:39,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Bonus images for you.

1999
02:14:40,957 --> 02:14:42,261
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is Piccarino.

2000
02:14:46,112 --> 02:15:11,709
[SPEAKER_08]: I like to play retro games on newer consoles just because you know there we go getting it on my new TV and everything it's really hard to hook up an Atari 2600 to a modern HD TV you kind of can't do it without a lot of converters you know I saw his Twitter this week with all the Sonic Chaos R-Type oh I fucking love R-Type good times no I fucking love R-Type you want to talk about good video game music R-Type

2001
02:15:12,609 --> 02:15:15,811
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to find the opening music for R-Type for me right now, Rob, or I will cry.

2002
02:15:15,911 --> 02:15:23,014
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I forgot to mention in my games that I played the last two weeks, but I actually played through both Sexy Parodius and Parodius Da.

2003
02:15:23,394 --> 02:15:24,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I love Parodius too.

2004
02:15:26,556 --> 02:15:27,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever played Chatting Parodius?

2005
02:15:28,416 --> 02:15:28,637
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

2006
02:15:29,797 --> 02:15:30,898
[SPEAKER_02]: You should play Chatting Parodius.

2007
02:15:32,518 --> 02:15:32,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me.

2008
02:15:32,979 --> 02:15:34,819
[SPEAKER_08]: This may or may not be the song you were looking for.

2009
02:15:34,879 --> 02:15:36,060
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know this game as well as you do.

2010
02:15:36,491 --> 02:15:37,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope, that's not.

2011
02:15:37,493 --> 02:15:38,095
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, that's his.

2012
02:15:39,778 --> 02:15:41,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, bitch, let it start before you make a call.

2013
02:15:48,892 --> 02:15:55,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I gotta watch how much... Here we go, here's the part.

2014
02:15:56,699 --> 02:15:59,722
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like my favorite piece of video game music ever.

2015
02:16:00,022 --> 02:16:02,004
[SPEAKER_08]: We gotta watch how much of this we play on Ustream.

2016
02:16:02,044 --> 02:16:04,026
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a zero tolerance on piracy.

2017
02:16:04,106 --> 02:16:04,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

2018
02:16:04,787 --> 02:16:06,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's on YouTube, so whatever.

2019
02:16:07,269 --> 02:16:07,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

2020
02:16:09,070 --> 02:16:20,937
[SPEAKER_02]: I would actually have to say, and this is why Dan and I have such a big classic game console collection, is because we really do like playing them on their intended consoles.

2021
02:16:22,237 --> 02:16:34,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes I like going back and playing a few things on a newer console, if that happens to be what I have hooked up, and say that the Neo Geo is at Dan's mom's house, because we have a bunch of our game stuff in storage at her place.

2022
02:16:34,904 --> 02:16:38,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I can't very well go grab the Neo Geo and play anything.

2023
02:16:38,765 --> 02:16:43,887
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess I can play King of Fighters on the Dreamcast or something.

2024
02:16:43,947 --> 02:16:44,727
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm just saying.

2025
02:16:45,567 --> 02:16:46,968
[SPEAKER_02]: So it depends on convenience.

2026
02:16:47,008 --> 02:16:49,868
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I've got it there, I will hook up the old stuff and play it.

2027
02:16:50,789 --> 02:16:51,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell to the fuck yeah.

2028
02:16:53,120 --> 02:16:53,380
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2029
02:16:53,620 --> 02:16:54,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that it for the mailbag?

2030
02:16:54,381 --> 02:16:55,221
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we have two more.

2031
02:16:55,381 --> 02:16:55,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.

2032
02:16:56,762 --> 02:16:57,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, OLR.

2033
02:16:57,682 --> 02:16:59,643
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been gone for two freaking weeks.

2034
02:16:59,684 --> 02:17:00,324
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that's true.

2035
02:17:01,084 --> 02:17:01,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, OLR.

2036
02:17:01,705 --> 02:17:02,685
[SPEAKER_02]: Defective Candy here.

2037
02:17:02,725 --> 02:17:06,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Just emailing to announce my boyfriend and I are the new proud parents of our own arcade cabinet.

2038
02:17:07,668 --> 02:17:09,028
[SPEAKER_02]: I picked it up on Craigslist for $70.

2039
02:17:09,189 --> 02:17:13,811
[SPEAKER_02]: It needed a little work, but the wood alone to build one from scratch would have run us over $100.

2040
02:17:13,911 --> 02:17:18,534
[SPEAKER_02]: We were thinking of turning it into a main cabinet, a PC-based system that uses emulators.

2041
02:17:18,634 --> 02:17:19,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we know.

2042
02:17:19,854 --> 02:17:22,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because the game card is shot.

2043
02:17:22,516 --> 02:17:26,619
[SPEAKER_02]: The original cabinet was from Datapro, although I am unsure what game originally came with it.

2044
02:17:26,679 --> 02:17:28,741
[SPEAKER_02]: It had WWF WrestleFest in it.

2045
02:17:29,201 --> 02:17:29,761
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that game.

2046
02:17:30,302 --> 02:17:35,326
[SPEAKER_02]: I found out Datapro was a large manufacturer of mostly pinball machines and I was wondering if DarkSakura was familiar with the brand.

2047
02:17:35,726 --> 02:17:38,768
[SPEAKER_02]: I am familiar with them, but I don't think that they put out much that was good.

2048
02:17:38,868 --> 02:17:39,729
[SPEAKER_02]: I can double check that.

2049
02:17:40,589 --> 02:17:43,852
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it was Gottlieb that put out that TMNT table.

2050
02:17:44,412 --> 02:17:45,012
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have to check.

2051
02:17:46,533 --> 02:17:51,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I wanted to thank you guys for keeping me in the gaming world all these years and inspiring me to follow my dreams of buying my own cabinet.

2052
02:17:52,434 --> 02:17:56,495
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the bug has really bitten us and we already went out to make a bar top cabinet next.

2053
02:17:56,735 --> 02:17:58,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep you updated on the status of our work.

2054
02:17:58,936 --> 02:17:59,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheers, Defective Candy.

2055
02:18:00,236 --> 02:18:01,356
[SPEAKER_08]: I want a bar top cabinet.

2056
02:18:01,776 --> 02:18:03,277
[SPEAKER_02]: They're more expensive than you think.

2057
02:18:03,377 --> 02:18:04,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the machine.

2058
02:18:06,614 --> 02:18:08,055
[SPEAKER_08]: WWF WrestleFest.

2059
02:18:08,095 --> 02:18:09,536
[SPEAKER_08]: What a cheap piece of crap.

2060
02:18:09,916 --> 02:18:12,037
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's your piece of crap, and congratulations.

2061
02:18:12,197 --> 02:18:12,637
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

2062
02:18:12,677 --> 02:18:13,318
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what?

2063
02:18:13,338 --> 02:18:16,980
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll be great for the meme, exactly what Defective Candy's talking about in the email.

2064
02:18:17,260 --> 02:18:18,000
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be a great thing.

2065
02:18:18,280 --> 02:18:20,321
[SPEAKER_02]: We built ours out of an old stand-up pole position.

2066
02:18:20,862 --> 02:18:21,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Our last one.

2067
02:18:22,321 --> 02:18:30,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Just be careful with what you're building your system out of because you need to have the right graphics card for it.

2068
02:18:30,208 --> 02:18:34,853
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's... You can find the specs online.

2069
02:18:34,873 --> 02:18:36,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, you can get special drivers.

2070
02:18:36,594 --> 02:18:37,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, I have...

2071
02:18:40,402 --> 02:18:49,085
[SPEAKER_07]: I ended up, before I was using an arcade VGA card, I recommend not going through that route because the arcade VGA cards are usually a little bit old.

2072
02:18:49,385 --> 02:18:51,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Although the newer ones are newer models.

2073
02:18:51,226 --> 02:19:02,470
[SPEAKER_07]: But I ended up going with an ATI card and then they have special drivers that you can get that will do the low res scaling for you.

2074
02:19:02,530 --> 02:19:03,270
[SPEAKER_07]: And then also...

2075
02:19:05,231 --> 02:19:10,134
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to get the JAMA adapter for the J-Pack.

2076
02:19:10,474 --> 02:19:11,335
[SPEAKER_07]: J-Packs are awesome.

2077
02:19:11,355 --> 02:19:12,035
[SPEAKER_07]: You need to get that.

2078
02:19:13,096 --> 02:19:18,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Also be careful that you buy good buttons that won't wear out quickly.

2079
02:19:19,500 --> 02:19:21,241
[SPEAKER_07]: For a cabinet like that, you don't need good buttons.

2080
02:19:21,561 --> 02:19:22,422
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter.

2081
02:19:22,442 --> 02:19:23,923
[SPEAKER_07]: The buttons are so damn cheap.

2082
02:19:23,943 --> 02:19:25,083
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like 50 cents.

2083
02:19:28,928 --> 02:19:29,909
[SPEAKER_02]: The last email.

2084
02:19:31,249 --> 02:19:33,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Have any of you played Pure Solar?

2085
02:19:33,930 --> 02:19:37,312
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an RPG created for the Sega Genesis but was originally released in 2008.

2086
02:19:37,672 --> 02:19:43,174
[SPEAKER_02]: A reprint of the game recently sold out and they will probably release it again at some point.

2087
02:19:43,675 --> 02:19:48,017
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really well made game and does something no other Genesis game has done before that I know of.

2088
02:19:48,497 --> 02:19:55,400
[SPEAKER_02]: If you purchase the companion CD soundtrack you can play the Genesis cart using the CD soundtrack in the Sega CD drive for the in-game music.

2089
02:19:55,980 --> 02:20:02,665
[SPEAKER_02]: The developer of Watermelon Games is currently working on a new Genesis Mega Drive game, so check out their website if you are interested.

2090
02:20:02,805 --> 02:20:05,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any Genesis RPG recommendations?

2091
02:20:12,529 --> 02:20:15,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Any of the fantasy stars really, although that's kind of an obvious answer.

2092
02:20:15,932 --> 02:20:18,113
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember this one.

2093
02:20:18,193 --> 02:20:22,076
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember some of the Genesis games that came out later.

2094
02:20:22,477 --> 02:20:25,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby had had one of the folks on his show a few years ago.

2095
02:20:27,480 --> 02:20:28,561
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't remember that one though.

2096
02:20:29,162 --> 02:20:33,805
[SPEAKER_08]: It's awesome that people are still making games though for Genesis, but they still do it for like Atari 2600 and all that.

2097
02:20:35,066 --> 02:20:35,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Genesis RPGs.

2098
02:20:36,146 --> 02:20:37,567
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't own a Genesis growing up.

2099
02:20:37,627 --> 02:20:38,647
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a website for it.

2100
02:20:38,967 --> 02:20:41,868
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a really hard question for me because I didn't own a Genesis growing up.

2101
02:20:43,508 --> 02:20:48,810
[SPEAKER_08]: And my friends, you know, the games we would play would be Mortal Kombat because I had the Blood and Street Fighter Championship Edition.

2102
02:20:49,310 --> 02:20:52,090
[SPEAKER_08]: We're all playing games on Genesis that weren't Phantasy Star.

2103
02:20:54,531 --> 02:20:55,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Dark Sakura?

2104
02:20:56,552 --> 02:20:58,572
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was a SNES person growing up.

2105
02:20:58,652 --> 02:20:58,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2106
02:20:59,012 --> 02:20:59,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Bobby reminded me.

2107
02:20:59,692 --> 02:21:00,733
[SPEAKER_08]: It was called Beggar Prince.

2108
02:21:00,893 --> 02:21:01,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2109
02:21:01,353 --> 02:21:01,593
[SPEAKER_08]: I knew.

2110
02:21:01,613 --> 02:21:02,133
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like.

2111
02:21:03,310 --> 02:21:21,507
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up playing Chrono Trigger in the Final Fantasies so but I mean I've gone back we picked up the Sega Ages 2500 a copy of a Phantasy Star which we had our friend Krista translate for us while we were playing through it so I mean

2112
02:21:23,607 --> 02:21:24,588
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't have a Genesis.

2113
02:21:24,608 --> 02:21:26,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Not until long after Genesis was done.

2114
02:21:26,049 --> 02:21:26,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

2115
02:21:46,650 --> 02:21:55,076
[SPEAKER_07]: and even then it was just Sonic and Vector Man and... Vector Man's pretty awesome.

2116
02:21:55,096 --> 02:21:57,198
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even remember what else we had.

2117
02:22:00,160 --> 02:22:00,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that a big booger?

2118
02:22:01,846 --> 02:22:02,547
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a chisel.

2119
02:22:02,987 --> 02:22:03,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

2120
02:22:04,388 --> 02:22:05,148
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to entertain.

2121
02:22:05,408 --> 02:22:11,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Since we're forced to use a, well, we're not really forced to use a webcam on Ustream, but, you know, it's weird to not have one.

2122
02:22:11,472 --> 02:22:14,054
[SPEAKER_08]: I've just been putting random objects in front of the camera because we're shy.

2123
02:22:14,154 --> 02:22:14,935
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a radio show.

2124
02:22:15,135 --> 02:22:16,616
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I didn't do my hair.

2125
02:22:16,956 --> 02:22:17,596
[SPEAKER_02]: One more paragraph.

2126
02:22:18,077 --> 02:22:18,317
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2127
02:22:18,997 --> 02:22:20,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck with the move to a new station.

2128
02:22:20,578 --> 02:22:22,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Your fans will follow you, so don't worry about that.

2129
02:22:22,939 --> 02:22:27,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking on the bright side, it sounds like Bobby will update his podcast feed, which hasn't been done in a couple of years.

2130
02:22:28,002 --> 02:22:31,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, this is a great opportunity for Bobby to turn over a new leaf.

2131
02:22:31,864 --> 02:22:32,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

2132
02:22:32,244 --> 02:22:33,445
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's by Will.

2133
02:22:33,965 --> 02:22:36,427
[SPEAKER_02]: He sent a link, which I'm going to post in the chat room.

2134
02:22:37,027 --> 02:22:38,408
[SPEAKER_08]: He must have just written that in the past hour.

2135
02:22:39,266 --> 02:22:43,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was there as of part A. Oh, there you go.

2136
02:22:43,648 --> 02:22:46,249
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a link to Pure Solar.

2137
02:22:46,269 --> 02:22:47,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

2138
02:22:47,289 --> 02:22:49,110
[SPEAKER_02]: So I might have to give this a try.

2139
02:22:49,190 --> 02:22:50,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a pelican?

2140
02:22:50,990 --> 02:22:51,831
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a pelican.

2141
02:22:53,331 --> 02:22:53,991
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, guys.

2142
02:22:54,211 --> 02:22:55,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's move on.

2143
02:22:55,212 --> 02:23:00,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Mailbag, of course, at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the website if you want to send us your question for next week.

2144
02:23:00,914 --> 02:23:02,194
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a lot of questions tonight.

2145
02:23:02,854 --> 02:23:04,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Now it's not time for questions.

2146
02:23:04,695 --> 02:23:06,716
[SPEAKER_08]: It's time for angst and destruction.

2147
02:23:24,805 --> 02:23:44,661
[SPEAKER_02]: FUs of the week, DarkSakura FU to being tired and having people not really understand the way that good design works Committees, just committees, they should just let me do everything and take it Also one on behalf of Becky, because I'm pissed off for her

2148
02:23:46,002 --> 02:23:51,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, fuck those little things that try to put you into a category and then hurt teacher for making her write about it.

2149
02:23:52,468 --> 02:23:54,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm pissed off that she has to do it.

2150
02:23:54,649 --> 02:23:57,992
[SPEAKER_02]: I've come up with interesting titles for her papers, including Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans.

2151
02:24:00,655 --> 02:24:05,639
[SPEAKER_02]: And my suggestion to her for the summary of her essay is, in summary, fuck you.

2152
02:24:05,659 --> 02:24:07,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

2153
02:24:09,242 --> 02:24:09,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki?

2154
02:24:09,442 --> 02:24:09,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki?

2155
02:24:09,858 --> 02:24:25,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you to myself for letting my backyard get so overgrown that I can only, not even really mow, I'd say hack through with a mower, a weed whacker, and various other tools.

2156
02:24:25,552 --> 02:24:33,118
[SPEAKER_07]: I can only get about most of my side yard done before I filled up two trash cans full of grass and vines.

2157
02:24:33,999 --> 02:24:34,900
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a jungle out there.

2158
02:24:37,492 --> 02:24:40,873
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to give an FU to the fact that here we are trying to do our last show on all games.

2159
02:24:41,093 --> 02:24:43,433
[SPEAKER_08]: There isn't an all-game server tonight, but whatever.

2160
02:24:43,554 --> 02:24:44,214
[SPEAKER_08]: These things happen.

2161
02:24:44,774 --> 02:24:47,694
[SPEAKER_08]: It just always seems to happen at key times.

2162
02:24:48,635 --> 02:24:51,115
[SPEAKER_08]: But I will say a thank you.

2163
02:24:51,655 --> 02:24:58,817
[SPEAKER_08]: For the listener that says we don't do enough thank yous during the FUs, I'm going to say a thank you to all of the folks, live listeners, listeners.

2164
02:24:59,697 --> 02:25:04,198
[SPEAKER_08]: for being really understanding in light of the difficult announcement we made tonight.

2165
02:25:04,318 --> 02:25:07,019
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel a lot of love and a lot of support.

2166
02:25:07,439 --> 02:25:08,839
[SPEAKER_08]: And that wasn't an easy thing.

2167
02:25:10,119 --> 02:25:14,040
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had to keep it under our wraps for a long time, and there's a sense of guilt that comes with that.

2168
02:25:15,900 --> 02:25:17,041
[SPEAKER_08]: But thank you guys for understanding.

2169
02:25:17,301 --> 02:25:18,661
[SPEAKER_08]: It's awesome.

2170
02:25:18,721 --> 02:25:19,401
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are great.

2171
02:25:19,941 --> 02:25:23,502
[SPEAKER_08]: And next week, hopefully, our new server won't go down.

2172
02:25:24,582 --> 02:25:24,943
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see.

2173
02:25:25,524 --> 02:25:26,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, that's it for FUZE.

2174
02:25:27,506 --> 02:25:31,893
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get into a few more stories and then Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR.

2175
02:25:32,734 --> 02:25:33,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a few of those.

2176
02:25:33,655 --> 02:25:34,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Sky Flying.

2177
02:25:34,156 --> 02:25:35,378
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got to do Sky Flying as well.

2178
02:25:36,099 --> 02:25:40,185
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's try to run through these last few stories so we have time for a couple Skype calls because I know people want to get in tonight.

2179
02:25:41,184 --> 02:25:47,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so Nintendo has made a patent for game emulation on low-capacity systems.

2180
02:25:47,787 --> 02:25:58,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, some sort of device that they have, it looks like in an airplane or something like that, where somebody is playing some sort of game or something on the back of a chair.

2181
02:25:59,131 --> 02:26:08,515
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, like an arm device or something like that, that would emulate Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance games, systems like cell phones and stuff like that.

2182
02:26:08,855 --> 02:26:15,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Funny, because that already exists, you know, as emulators on, said, pretty much every platform known man.

2183
02:26:15,418 --> 02:26:19,459
[SPEAKER_07]: But now they're making it official, I guess, that they're going to do some sort of emulators.

2184
02:26:21,100 --> 02:26:26,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Which points more towards, you know, having some sort of software that runs on those, you know.

2185
02:26:26,602 --> 02:26:28,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Buy all the old shit all over again.

2186
02:26:28,583 --> 02:26:29,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course.

2187
02:26:29,744 --> 02:26:30,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Played in...

2188
02:26:32,003 --> 02:26:42,114
[SPEAKER_07]: I like how you can play them on the back of airplane seats or on my phone that I have or my game device or my tablet or whatever else because they have emulators for everything.

2189
02:26:43,656 --> 02:26:44,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Computer.

2190
02:26:46,075 --> 02:27:12,781
[SPEAKER_08]: LOL lawsuits Ubisoft and game trailers were sued this week over Assassin's Creed for that email earlier and Assassin's Creed copyright apparently Assassin's Creed stole core ideas from John Besswinger's novel Link Link was published in 2002 Assassin's Creed first came out in 2007 now yes that's right I said he's suing Ubisoft and game trailers

2191
02:27:13,789 --> 02:27:14,891
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2192
02:27:25,180 --> 02:27:31,586
[SPEAKER_08]: His novel discusses assassinations and has spiritual and biblical tones similar to those in Assassin's Creed.

2193
02:27:31,966 --> 02:27:36,610
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also a battle between good and evil that was stolen right out of Link.

2194
02:27:36,630 --> 02:27:38,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Yours and every other book.

2195
02:27:39,613 --> 02:27:50,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Apparently the Link device is where users access ancestral memories and relive specific moments in history much as the Animus in Assassin's Creed does.

2196
02:27:51,744 --> 02:27:53,245
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never heard that plot device ever before.

2197
02:27:53,265 --> 02:27:56,746
[SPEAKER_07]: I came out with a book with fantasy characters and there's elves in it.

2198
02:27:56,947 --> 02:27:57,727
[SPEAKER_07]: I want my money.

2199
02:27:59,908 --> 02:28:00,548
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is great.

2200
02:28:00,928 --> 02:28:02,269
[SPEAKER_08]: The estate of Tolkien will sue you.

2201
02:28:02,289 --> 02:28:09,032
[SPEAKER_08]: The guy is suing game trailers because of the trailers that infringe on the copyright.

2202
02:28:09,853 --> 02:28:14,455
[SPEAKER_08]: So just for hosting the trailer to Ubisoft's game, game trailers has been looped in.

2203
02:28:14,515 --> 02:28:18,597
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's where this thing went from okay, well maybe, to fucking absurd.

2204
02:28:20,273 --> 02:28:20,513
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura

2205
02:28:45,339 --> 02:28:50,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there is going to be Silent Hill Revelation 3D.

2206
02:28:50,802 --> 02:28:51,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

2207
02:28:51,362 --> 02:28:52,743
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to be in the theaters.

2208
02:28:52,863 --> 02:28:53,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

2209
02:28:54,344 --> 02:28:56,845
[SPEAKER_02]: October 26th, which is my brother's birthday.

2210
02:28:57,026 --> 02:28:57,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

2211
02:28:59,107 --> 02:29:01,248
[SPEAKER_02]: I am so excited.

2212
02:29:02,529 --> 02:29:05,970
[SPEAKER_02]: But it will have Sean Bean and Carrie Ann Moss.

2213
02:29:07,011 --> 02:29:09,532
[SPEAKER_02]: And it will sort of follow Silent Hill 3.

2214
02:29:10,573 --> 02:29:14,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Just that it's got Heather Mason in it and their stuff.

2215
02:29:14,375 --> 02:29:16,816
[SPEAKER_08]: I find it fascinating it's most of the same cast from the first movie.

2216
02:29:16,836 --> 02:29:18,797
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great that they were able to get them all to come back.

2217
02:29:19,217 --> 02:29:19,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's cool.

2218
02:29:20,058 --> 02:29:21,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Will Sean Bean die?

2219
02:29:21,078 --> 02:29:21,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Because he dies in everything.

2220
02:29:21,858 --> 02:29:23,759
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to say that.

2221
02:29:23,879 --> 02:29:24,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, sorry.

2222
02:29:26,701 --> 02:29:27,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't sue me.

2223
02:29:27,461 --> 02:29:30,762
[SPEAKER_02]: But apparently it's going to have Akira Yamaoka's music again.

2224
02:29:32,183 --> 02:29:34,144
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm excited.

2225
02:29:34,364 --> 02:29:35,805
[SPEAKER_02]: I am super, super excited.

2226
02:29:35,865 --> 02:29:43,128
[SPEAKER_02]: But it doesn't say who... It means I'm going to have to go on the wiki now to see who actually directed it because I don't think it's Gans this time.

2227
02:29:46,531 --> 02:30:12,920
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Morpheus in the chat room Anne Rice came up with overly gay vampires first but no suit against Twilight okay I'm on I should be offended but I'm totally not that's great okay I'm on the IMDB and it said no it won't load okay does this mean does this mean OLR field trip to the movies OLR night at the movies movie date Michael J Bassett will DarkSakura and I share a popcorn I don't need popcorn

2228
02:30:13,960 --> 02:30:14,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Allergy to corn.

2229
02:30:16,341 --> 02:30:17,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Will Loki and I share popcorn?

2230
02:30:18,041 --> 02:30:18,882
[SPEAKER_02]: You and I, we can share.

2231
02:30:18,942 --> 02:30:19,982
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm not sharing.

2232
02:30:20,542 --> 02:30:20,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

2233
02:30:20,962 --> 02:30:21,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Share.

2234
02:30:22,223 --> 02:30:22,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, Junior Mints.

2235
02:30:23,243 --> 02:30:24,384
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we'll share Junior Mints.

2236
02:30:24,404 --> 02:30:25,144
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll show Junior Mints.

2237
02:30:25,684 --> 02:30:29,205
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want an excuse to put my hand in the box at the same time we hold hands.

2238
02:30:30,306 --> 02:30:30,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw.

2239
02:30:30,886 --> 02:30:33,607
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's directed and written by Michael J. Bassett.

2240
02:30:33,727 --> 02:30:37,508
[SPEAKER_02]: And another person, this is Kit Harrington, who I have no idea who that is.

2241
02:30:38,648 --> 02:30:42,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Some dude whose mom's name is Debra.

2242
02:30:44,203 --> 02:30:47,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, he's in Game of Thrones, no wonder, because I don't watch that stupid show

2243
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:50,221
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not going to go into it.

2244
02:30:50,661 --> 02:30:53,363
[SPEAKER_08]: I happen to know a lot of people really love that show.

2245
02:30:53,383 --> 02:30:53,823
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't watched it.

2246
02:30:53,863 --> 02:30:56,424
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to say what I've told lots of people.

2247
02:30:57,305 --> 02:30:58,886
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't give a shit if you like it.

2248
02:30:59,586 --> 02:31:01,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't tell me how good it is.

2249
02:31:01,347 --> 02:31:02,087
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.

2250
02:31:03,208 --> 02:31:05,029
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a really good series.

2251
02:31:05,709 --> 02:31:06,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck off.

2252
02:31:06,389 --> 02:31:07,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan likes it.

2253
02:31:07,550 --> 02:31:09,591
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what I have to say.

2254
02:31:10,071 --> 02:31:14,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because I don't like something that you like doesn't mean I'm making a statement about you.

2255
02:31:14,614 --> 02:31:15,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't take it personally.

2256
02:31:15,714 --> 02:31:17,095
[SPEAKER_08]: Or that it's bad necessarily.

2257
02:31:17,816 --> 02:31:41,919
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah it's just not something I'm into and it has nothing to do with my opinion of you if I know that you like it then I will be quiet and not you know shit talk it in front of you out of respect for my friendship with you but if I don't like it I'm not gonna hide that I don't like it a lot of people might think supernatural is the dumbest thing on TV and they're entitled to that don't tell me I don't care all right moving on

2258
02:31:43,802 --> 02:31:47,606
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how it is when you say, oh, I kind of don't like this, and everyone jumps on you.

2259
02:31:47,666 --> 02:31:48,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you like it?

2260
02:31:48,406 --> 02:31:49,948
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the best thing ever.

2261
02:31:50,408 --> 02:31:51,649
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm offended that you don't like it.

2262
02:31:51,969 --> 02:31:54,531
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how I feel when people tell me they don't like RuPaul's Drag Race.

2263
02:31:54,631 --> 02:32:00,596
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, okay, hate on Ru all you want because Fifi O'Hara's in the final three, but seriously, it's the best fucking show on TV.

2264
02:32:00,877 --> 02:32:01,197
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up.

2265
02:32:02,480 --> 02:32:03,221
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what I mean.

2266
02:32:03,982 --> 02:32:08,145
[SPEAKER_02]: When people take their shit personally and it's not something they say personally.

2267
02:32:09,987 --> 02:32:11,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Black Wolf says, I take it personally.

2268
02:32:11,908 --> 02:32:14,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Legend of Zaku says, King Joffrey will have Jaime's head.

2269
02:32:17,333 --> 02:32:19,695
[SPEAKER_02]: What, after he gets stabbed sitting on his chair of swords?

2270
02:32:20,515 --> 02:32:21,056
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2271
02:32:21,116 --> 02:32:21,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care.

2272
02:32:21,776 --> 02:32:23,898
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I call it behind everyone's back is chair of swords.

2273
02:32:23,918 --> 02:32:24,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

2274
02:32:24,779 --> 02:32:24,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

2275
02:32:25,319 --> 02:32:26,300
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2276
02:32:50,499 --> 02:33:02,566
[SPEAKER_07]: It is featuring bikini model Yuki Kamamura and well, you have to roll over her breasts that protrude all over the place on the map.

2277
02:33:03,206 --> 02:33:06,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it's like those wonderful mouse pads that you can buy.

2278
02:33:06,788 --> 02:33:11,231
[SPEAKER_07]: You must navigate your monkey ball over a field of breasts.

2279
02:33:12,752 --> 02:33:13,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Well played.

2280
02:33:15,053 --> 02:33:15,493
[SPEAKER_07]: Well played.

2281
02:33:17,815 --> 02:33:18,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Boobies!

2282
02:33:21,380 --> 02:33:24,641
[SPEAKER_08]: I just worry this is going to start a new fetish of some type, and I worry.

2283
02:33:24,921 --> 02:33:25,861
[SPEAKER_08]: I worry for the future.

2284
02:33:26,501 --> 02:33:27,321
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's awesome.

2285
02:33:27,541 --> 02:33:33,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, actually, if you remember, Super Monkey Ball was supposed to have it where you can actually create maps based off a picture.

2286
02:33:33,282 --> 02:33:38,043
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you took a picture of a banana, it would create a banana-shaped map.

2287
02:33:38,523 --> 02:33:40,944
[SPEAKER_07]: So what is the TTP for that game?

2288
02:33:41,844 --> 02:33:43,724
[SPEAKER_07]: How long before we have penis-shaped maps?

2289
02:33:45,505 --> 02:33:46,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Half a second?

2290
02:33:46,865 --> 02:33:47,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Two seconds?

2291
02:33:47,505 --> 02:33:47,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

2292
02:33:51,222 --> 02:34:05,528
[SPEAKER_08]: um a millisecond a millisecond all right instance or instantaneous one Toa Gak in the chat room says so you move your balls over the boobs yes just like that

2293
02:34:07,188 --> 02:34:08,549
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, one more story for you guys.

2294
02:34:08,609 --> 02:34:15,753
[SPEAKER_08]: And guys, we have to end on a good note tonight because this is like the hero of the gaming industry this week.

2295
02:34:15,793 --> 02:34:16,513
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have to end.

2296
02:34:16,793 --> 02:34:18,354
[SPEAKER_08]: We talk a lot of shit.

2297
02:34:18,374 --> 02:34:21,916
[SPEAKER_08]: We commentate a lot on this and sometimes have a very cynical attitude.

2298
02:34:21,936 --> 02:34:25,258
[SPEAKER_08]: But this guy deserves a fucking round of applause.

2299
02:34:25,818 --> 02:34:28,640
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to end by tipping our hats to this man tonight.

2300
02:34:29,120 --> 02:34:29,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Who is it?

2301
02:34:30,521 --> 02:34:33,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Katsuhiro Harada Do you know that name?

2302
02:34:34,311 --> 02:34:38,883
[SPEAKER_08]: You would if you're a fan of Tekken He's the Tekken series producer Totally love

2303
02:34:40,154 --> 02:34:41,715
[SPEAKER_08]: And why is he our hero this week?

2304
02:34:41,976 --> 02:34:43,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Because he's a pimp.

2305
02:34:43,917 --> 02:34:47,961
[SPEAKER_08]: He talked to Edge Online, who apparently has been getting a lot of people this week in interviews.

2306
02:34:48,361 --> 02:34:55,267
[SPEAKER_08]: And he says, well, he didn't say if you are worried about what Capcom's doing, then don't worry about this.

2307
02:34:55,348 --> 02:35:02,314
[SPEAKER_08]: But he did basically say no tech and game will ever have DLC characters at all.

2308
02:35:09,824 --> 02:35:10,584
[SPEAKER_08]: I tip my hat.

2309
02:35:12,505 --> 02:35:14,866
[SPEAKER_08]: No Tekken game will ever have DLC characters at all.

2310
02:35:15,426 --> 02:35:17,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Too bad Tekken 6 was shit, but we forgive you.

2311
02:35:18,727 --> 02:35:22,369
[SPEAKER_08]: We forgive you and stand by your amazing statement.

2312
02:35:23,969 --> 02:35:31,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, before you get too excited, he did say vanity items might be added to the game after the fact and would have a charge.

2313
02:35:31,480 --> 02:35:35,325
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, alternate costumes and pre-order bonuses for that.

2314
02:35:35,565 --> 02:35:38,750
[SPEAKER_08]: But no DLC characters, which is good enough for me.

2315
02:35:39,269 --> 02:35:42,331
[SPEAKER_08]: If people want to play Barbie with their characters and that costs money, then fine.

2316
02:35:42,351 --> 02:35:44,172
[SPEAKER_08]: But no DLC characters.

2317
02:35:44,232 --> 02:35:44,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2318
02:35:45,132 --> 02:35:45,533
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

2319
02:35:45,553 --> 02:35:47,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Now make sure Tekken 7 is a good game.

2320
02:35:47,334 --> 02:35:47,974
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's funny?

2321
02:35:48,675 --> 02:35:50,376
[SPEAKER_02]: You talking about playing Barbies with the characters?

2322
02:35:50,816 --> 02:35:53,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan was really into Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball.

2323
02:35:54,058 --> 02:35:55,679
[SPEAKER_02]: And he'd be like, look at this outfit!

2324
02:35:55,699 --> 02:35:57,360
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, oh, you're being such a girl.

2325
02:35:58,120 --> 02:35:58,580
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

2326
02:35:58,700 --> 02:35:59,121
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

2327
02:35:59,161 --> 02:36:01,802
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that's what he was referring to as far as look at this outfit.

2328
02:36:01,822 --> 02:36:04,344
[SPEAKER_07]: It's more like, look at how small this outfit is.

2329
02:36:06,391 --> 02:36:10,381
[SPEAKER_02]: It would just be funny to think about how he got these different outfits.

2330
02:36:10,501 --> 02:36:11,103
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, oh.

2331
02:36:12,563 --> 02:36:14,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Skype line's open!

2332
02:36:14,104 --> 02:36:17,366
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2333
02:36:17,727 --> 02:36:18,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Give us a call.

2334
02:36:18,287 --> 02:36:19,788
[SPEAKER_08]: We got time for a couple quick calls tonight.

2335
02:36:19,808 --> 02:36:23,591
[SPEAKER_08]: We're running a little long due to the earlier announcement that caused Bobby to run long.

2336
02:36:24,111 --> 02:36:26,653
[SPEAKER_08]: But we will try to squeeze in a few calls here.

2337
02:36:26,793 --> 02:36:30,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2338
02:36:30,916 --> 02:36:32,697
[SPEAKER_08]: In the meantime, let me try to get to some tweets.

2339
02:36:32,757 --> 02:36:38,461
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have a whole lot of time, but I'm going to get to these as fast as I can here.

2340
02:36:39,061 --> 02:36:39,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

2341
02:36:40,502 --> 02:36:42,983
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkTetsuya wants to remind everybody about The Hunt.

2342
02:36:44,543 --> 02:36:47,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, DarkTetsuya, for putting that on at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2343
02:36:47,664 --> 02:36:55,326
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize that things have been kind of going to the back burner in spite of everything else going on with the announcements and things like that.

2344
02:36:55,606 --> 02:36:58,047
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you haven't checked it out, it's a fun little competition.

2345
02:36:58,127 --> 02:37:00,947
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkTetsuya is trying to get the little scoreboard and get people into it.

2346
02:37:01,007 --> 02:37:01,607
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really cute.

2347
02:37:01,948 --> 02:37:03,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Check that out at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

2348
02:37:04,148 --> 02:37:06,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Piece of advice, don't get eaten by a Gru.

2349
02:37:06,469 --> 02:37:09,129
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can guess where the next challenge is probably going.

2350
02:37:09,669 --> 02:37:11,010
[SPEAKER_08]: In the meantime, let's go to some calls.

2351
02:37:11,090 --> 02:37:12,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2352
02:37:12,070 --> 02:37:12,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

2353
02:37:13,070 --> 02:37:14,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, hey, hey, it's Ranma.

2354
02:37:14,350 --> 02:37:15,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, hey, hey, what's up?

2355
02:37:16,311 --> 02:37:17,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a lot.

2356
02:37:17,411 --> 02:37:22,232
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple things I wanted to discuss in regards to PAX East because I didn't get a chance to last time.

2357
02:37:22,352 --> 02:37:22,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2358
02:37:23,273 --> 02:37:25,593
[SPEAKER_06]: But before that, I just have one thing to say to you, Rob.

2359
02:37:25,713 --> 02:37:25,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

2360
02:37:28,014 --> 02:37:29,294
[SPEAKER_06]: In the time I've listened to the show,

2361
02:37:30,399 --> 02:37:31,639
[SPEAKER_06]: You've worked your ass off.

2362
02:37:32,040 --> 02:37:34,260
[SPEAKER_06]: You've delivered so much.

2363
02:37:34,940 --> 02:37:37,821
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't care what you say.

2364
02:37:38,862 --> 02:37:41,042
[SPEAKER_06]: You earned that diva fit you made.

2365
02:37:41,943 --> 02:37:42,863
[SPEAKER_06]: You earned that.

2366
02:37:44,964 --> 02:37:51,946
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, for what you give back and for that one person to say something for you to fly off the handle like that, you earned it.

2367
02:37:53,540 --> 02:37:55,341
[SPEAKER_08]: This is four-year-old news, Ranma.

2368
02:37:55,381 --> 02:37:57,023
[SPEAKER_08]: This is... We're over.

2369
02:37:57,624 --> 02:38:01,687
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll probably... You know what's funny in light of all the news tonight about All Games and everything?

2370
02:38:01,747 --> 02:38:06,572
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll probably end up being the big highlight of OLR on the All Games Network.

2371
02:38:07,372 --> 02:38:10,815
[SPEAKER_06]: And between me and Misty, one of us has that episode on our hard drives.

2372
02:38:10,855 --> 02:38:11,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, great.

2373
02:38:12,737 --> 02:38:15,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Misty's getting a present when she comes out here for the 10-year show, by the way.

2374
02:38:15,998 --> 02:38:16,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wow.

2375
02:38:16,638 --> 02:38:17,779
[SPEAKER_08]: Shit, was I supposed to say that on air?

2376
02:38:17,879 --> 02:38:18,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, oops, I did.

2377
02:38:20,059 --> 02:38:21,360
[SPEAKER_08]: I found some old episodes.

2378
02:38:23,040 --> 02:38:24,241
[SPEAKER_08]: So, all right.

2379
02:38:25,161 --> 02:38:29,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, what did you really want to tell us tonight, Ranma, about PAX East?

2380
02:38:29,142 --> 02:38:30,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a couple of quick things.

2381
02:38:30,322 --> 02:38:35,704
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing was, you know the portable console lounge?

2382
02:38:36,984 --> 02:38:38,225
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2383
02:38:38,425 --> 02:38:41,686
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lounge full of 3DSs, the Vita stands alone.

2384
02:38:42,768 --> 02:38:43,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Really?

2385
02:38:43,069 --> 02:38:45,653
[SPEAKER_08]: Like nobody brought Vitas or what happened?

2386
02:38:46,194 --> 02:38:48,719
[SPEAKER_06]: There was like one or two people with Vitas.

2387
02:38:48,779 --> 02:38:54,269
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like for every 10 3DSs you saw, you probably saw maybe one person with a Vita.

2388
02:38:54,912 --> 02:39:17,664
[SPEAKER_08]: you know what though it's everybody's trying to street pass and everybody's trying to clear their queue for find me and everything I gotta say I got a shit ton of street passes at Disneyland this week when I was there and um yeah I was able to get all the way to the second to last boss and find me too and let me tell you there's some real bullshit that happens in find me too can I just say who you trying to kid anyway

2389
02:39:20,071 --> 02:39:21,412
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, I agree with you about Finding Me 2.

2390
02:39:21,532 --> 02:39:22,873
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, who are you trying to kid?

2391
02:39:22,973 --> 02:39:24,854
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, it's kind of getting to the point where it's bullshit.

2392
02:39:24,934 --> 02:39:29,897
[SPEAKER_08]: But I will say this, I did also finish the Kid Icarus puzzle and the little swap puzzle thing.

2393
02:39:30,697 --> 02:39:33,899
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a pretty sweet little 3D image that it's like in motion.

2394
02:39:34,879 --> 02:39:35,760
[SPEAKER_06]: I finished that one.

2395
02:39:35,780 --> 02:39:41,483
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still trying to finish up the rest of the puzzles as I continue to street pass every single day to and from work.

2396
02:39:42,744 --> 02:39:42,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

2397
02:39:44,771 --> 02:39:46,172
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually something I was wondering about.

2398
02:39:46,392 --> 02:39:46,692
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

2399
02:39:46,852 --> 02:39:52,096
[SPEAKER_02]: With the lenticular photos that the 3DS takes, Dan's phone takes lenticular photos as well.

2400
02:39:52,796 --> 02:39:56,098
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if they would be readable by each other's... You might.

2401
02:39:56,198 --> 02:39:57,779
[SPEAKER_08]: See what kind of file format it does.

2402
02:39:57,859 --> 02:39:59,340
[SPEAKER_08]: See if you can put it on the web especially.

2403
02:39:59,640 --> 02:40:02,782
[SPEAKER_08]: If it can go on the web and then you can see it in the 3DS browser, it might work.

2404
02:40:03,242 --> 02:40:03,763
[SPEAKER_08]: It probably would.

2405
02:40:04,423 --> 02:40:05,284
[SPEAKER_08]: It just depends on the full frame.

2406
02:40:05,304 --> 02:40:05,964
[SPEAKER_02]: It just occurred to me.

2407
02:40:06,945 --> 02:40:07,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Play around with that.

2408
02:40:08,800 --> 02:40:09,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, anything else, Ranma?

2409
02:40:10,240 --> 02:40:17,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I was telling Jamie this last night, but as you know, the big thing about PAX is the Omegathon, right?

2410
02:40:18,202 --> 02:40:18,522
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

2411
02:40:19,302 --> 02:40:30,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I am proud to say that one of my very good friends, Tina Lam, if I'm not mistaken, first female gamer to make it to the finals of the Omegathon.

2412
02:40:31,145 --> 02:40:31,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Good for her.

2413
02:40:31,825 --> 02:40:32,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Did she win?

2414
02:40:33,415 --> 02:40:35,020
[SPEAKER_06]: No, she came in second place.

2415
02:40:35,240 --> 02:40:39,794
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a feeling because you would have said the first female winner of the Omegathon if that was the case.

2416
02:40:40,195 --> 02:40:40,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's too bad.

2417
02:40:41,904 --> 02:40:45,986
[SPEAKER_08]: Wasn't the last game some type of old school board game with the pucks?

2418
02:40:47,386 --> 02:40:48,547
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I thought I heard somewhere.

2419
02:40:49,047 --> 02:40:55,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and on the ride back from PAX, my Twitter feed was blowing up because she goes by the name of Pork Bun.

2420
02:40:55,430 --> 02:40:57,711
[SPEAKER_06]: So we were like, go team Pork Buns.

2421
02:40:57,751 --> 02:40:58,771
[SPEAKER_06]: You can do it, Pork Buns.

2422
02:40:58,791 --> 02:41:02,933
[SPEAKER_06]: We were just going nuts, just rooting for her because we want her to win.

2423
02:41:03,013 --> 02:41:09,436
[SPEAKER_06]: But since she came in second, from what I was told, her and her partner are coming back next year to compete again.

2424
02:41:11,371 --> 02:41:11,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's right.

2425
02:41:12,011 --> 02:41:13,472
[SPEAKER_08]: The runner-up always gets to compete again.

2426
02:41:13,712 --> 02:41:14,112
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

2427
02:41:14,452 --> 02:41:15,212
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard that before.

2428
02:41:16,873 --> 02:41:17,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, good.

2429
02:41:18,233 --> 02:41:22,474
[SPEAKER_06]: And I told Jamie last night, I figured she would love to hear an awesome story like that.

2430
02:41:23,274 --> 02:41:26,315
[SPEAKER_08]: I totally think that we should interview her.

2431
02:41:26,675 --> 02:41:28,336
[SPEAKER_08]: One day, maybe DarkSakura should be in the final.

2432
02:41:28,356 --> 02:41:29,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we'd love to interview her.

2433
02:41:29,436 --> 02:41:29,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?

2434
02:41:29,836 --> 02:41:30,276
[SPEAKER_08]: It'd be fun.

2435
02:41:30,756 --> 02:41:31,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'll see what I can do.

2436
02:41:31,936 --> 02:41:32,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it'd be great.

2437
02:41:33,017 --> 02:41:33,417
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd love that.

2438
02:41:33,997 --> 02:41:34,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

2439
02:41:34,955 --> 02:41:35,255
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2440
02:41:35,675 --> 02:41:38,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Ranma, I've got to let you go because we've got a lot of calls trying to come in.

2441
02:41:38,217 --> 02:41:39,438
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll talk to you later.

2442
02:41:39,458 --> 02:41:39,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, buddy?

2443
02:41:40,078 --> 02:41:40,278
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2444
02:41:40,318 --> 02:41:40,878
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, bro.

2445
02:41:41,018 --> 02:41:41,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Stay fabulous.

2446
02:41:42,179 --> 02:41:42,699
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course.

2447
02:41:43,740 --> 02:41:45,201
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2448
02:41:45,221 --> 02:41:48,202
[SPEAKER_08]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or I use your name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio.

2449
02:41:48,583 --> 02:41:50,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Getting you some tweets real quick here.

2450
02:41:50,884 --> 02:41:52,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Tiger Claw sends us a couple tweets.

2451
02:41:52,565 --> 02:41:55,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Sony wants MMO players to meet each other in real life.

2452
02:41:56,207 --> 02:41:56,427
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

2453
02:41:58,032 --> 02:41:59,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XI Fan Appreciation Events

2454
02:42:27,469 --> 02:42:30,390
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess that's kind of what you do with like the DS.

2455
02:42:30,550 --> 02:42:33,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Go to a Starbucks and get the Nintendo Zone or whatever.

2456
02:42:33,151 --> 02:42:33,852
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like with Nier.

2457
02:42:33,952 --> 02:42:35,392
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all they're doing is Nier stuff.

2458
02:42:35,652 --> 02:42:36,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that makes sense.

2459
02:42:36,673 --> 02:42:37,013
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2460
02:42:37,833 --> 02:42:38,194
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that is.

2461
02:42:38,214 --> 02:42:39,774
[SPEAKER_08]: That is kind of like the same thing as Nier.

2462
02:42:40,034 --> 02:42:42,776
[SPEAKER_08]: I wonder if the Vita could facilitate that transfer.

2463
02:42:43,396 --> 02:42:44,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I'm thinking a little highbrow.

2464
02:42:45,036 --> 02:42:45,517
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

2465
02:42:47,277 --> 02:42:48,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to another call.

2466
02:42:48,905 --> 02:42:49,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2467
02:42:49,865 --> 02:42:50,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's this?

2468
02:42:51,006 --> 02:42:52,146
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Legend of Zaku.

2469
02:42:52,346 --> 02:42:53,266
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Zaku.

2470
02:42:53,646 --> 02:42:55,087
[SPEAKER_08]: I can see Zaku tonight.

2471
02:42:55,107 --> 02:42:55,887
[SPEAKER_08]: What is up with this?

2472
02:42:56,147 --> 02:42:56,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

2473
02:42:56,607 --> 02:42:59,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm on my Mac, my monitor died tonight.

2474
02:42:59,148 --> 02:43:00,849
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, I have a backup.

2475
02:43:01,089 --> 02:43:06,310
[SPEAKER_08]: I would put you on the Ustream if I knew how, but I wasn't prepared to go video tonight, so whatever.

2476
02:43:06,630 --> 02:43:07,331
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind, buddy?

2477
02:43:08,591 --> 02:43:11,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing much, just like catching up on gaming and the...

2478
02:43:12,840 --> 02:43:14,902
[SPEAKER_01]: HBO Go and 360 for non-gaming stuff.

2479
02:43:14,942 --> 02:43:17,104
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, mostly League of Legends and Battlefield.

2480
02:43:17,865 --> 02:43:21,588
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's been either of those two games.

2481
02:43:22,029 --> 02:43:37,043
[SPEAKER_01]: And going on what I've seen in packs, like in the Portable Gaming Lounge, I'm pretty certain, I think Adam was right, well, Ranma was right in the sense that, yeah, there probably was a little bit more of a lopsided towards 3DSs.

2482
02:43:39,816 --> 02:43:43,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't get me wrong, the beat is pretty good, especially for Lumines.

2483
02:43:43,722 --> 02:43:49,091
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would also imagine that not only 3DS would have to...

2484
02:43:49,827 --> 02:43:53,631
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, compete against the same space as folks with iPhones that I saw over there.

2485
02:43:53,852 --> 02:43:55,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Nier isn't also quite the same thing.

2486
02:43:55,994 --> 02:43:58,657
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, Nier isn't the same as that 3DS StreetPass.

2487
02:43:58,677 --> 02:44:02,682
[SPEAKER_08]: And I seriously think a lot of those people were just trying to, like, I never get to StreetPass with people.

2488
02:44:02,982 --> 02:44:04,684
[SPEAKER_08]: I have never, ever played Find Me.

2489
02:44:04,924 --> 02:44:08,108
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, like, because, you know, a lot of people don't take their DSs with them everywhere.

2490
02:44:08,148 --> 02:44:10,471
[SPEAKER_08]: But a convention like PAX is a great place to do it.

2491
02:44:10,831 --> 02:44:21,178
[SPEAKER_01]: Even then, there were still folks on their iPads playing all the other types of iPad games, not limited to Angry Birds.

2492
02:44:21,679 --> 02:44:23,840
[SPEAKER_08]: They were just showing off that they had the fancy new ones.

2493
02:44:24,401 --> 02:44:37,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they had their iPads or their tablets, but it was pretty much like, obviously the 3DS was the only traditional portable game console that was represented, but everything else was still mobile.

2494
02:44:37,830 --> 02:44:39,371
[SPEAKER_01]: I even had the chance to break out my

2495
02:44:40,168 --> 02:44:44,452
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, my phone for a bit, but, you know, battery was getting there.

2496
02:44:44,512 --> 02:44:53,300
[SPEAKER_01]: But you get the idea that it's not just 3DS anymore when you have, like, when you have mobile, especially... I'm trying to remember.

2497
02:44:53,921 --> 02:44:54,021
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah!

2498
02:44:54,742 --> 02:45:01,048
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was... I forgot which one from Nintendo actually said that he actually liked Angry Birds...

2499
02:45:03,547 --> 02:45:08,089
[SPEAKER_08]: I do remember reading that same quote, something about, you know, like kind of tipping the hats of the competition.

2500
02:45:08,549 --> 02:45:09,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Angry Birds ain't that bad.

2501
02:45:10,070 --> 02:45:18,374
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet he goes against the wishes of his boss, who basically chides Angry Birds for basically going after their bread and butter.

2502
02:45:18,614 --> 02:45:19,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but you know he's played it.

2503
02:45:21,058 --> 02:45:35,682
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I guess Nintendo didn't keep these... I don't know if they're keeping their guys on a PR leash, but that's kind of damaging if the official company line is like, we hate casual gamers.

2504
02:45:36,502 --> 02:45:39,603
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything outside of, we hate casual developers.

2505
02:45:39,703 --> 02:45:42,103
[SPEAKER_01]: The guys who create Angry Birds or any other...

2506
02:45:44,483 --> 02:45:46,924
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think Nintendo hates casual gamers.

2507
02:45:46,964 --> 02:45:49,224
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at what we just talked about tonight.

2508
02:45:49,284 --> 02:45:51,585
[SPEAKER_08]: Mario 2, who's that really aimed at?

2509
02:45:51,785 --> 02:45:54,725
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a hodgepodge of the casual and the hardcore market.

2510
02:45:54,845 --> 02:46:04,387
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like that whole platform where people could just buy a developer license for an iPhone developer account.

2511
02:46:07,392 --> 02:46:14,497
[SPEAKER_01]: for $200 and make an app that they sell for $2 a pop and make hundreds of thousands in profits.

2512
02:46:15,377 --> 02:46:21,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Meanwhile, folks who are doing the same for 3DS have to go through the licensing fees and they're lucky to break even.

2513
02:46:23,103 --> 02:46:34,912
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess my point is that with these platforms that have very little overhead, it's a lot easier to create breakout hits for audiences that Nintendo may or may not pick up due to them not taking that many risks.

2514
02:46:36,713 --> 02:46:44,139
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes back to the fact that, I hate to say this, but most of the Japanese developers are not that much of a risk takers.

2515
02:46:44,619 --> 02:46:46,721
[SPEAKER_01]: What did we just talk about with Konami?

2516
02:46:47,021 --> 02:46:47,541
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

2517
02:46:48,462 --> 02:46:58,132
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, whereas the Western counterparts, at least they understand that if they don't innovate or they don't take risks, they're pretty much dead in the water.

2518
02:46:58,353 --> 02:47:03,318
[SPEAKER_08]: And some have lost big, unfortunately, and that's why we hear about these studio closures and so on.

2519
02:47:03,618 --> 02:47:07,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Sako, I've got to let you go so we can get some more calls, but I'm glad you had a good time at PAX East.

2520
02:47:07,703 --> 02:47:08,543
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll hopefully see you next year.

2521
02:47:09,284 --> 02:47:11,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely Later buddy Bye

2522
02:47:31,061 --> 02:47:31,621
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thank God.

2523
02:47:31,641 --> 02:47:32,262
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Porkchop.

2524
02:47:32,282 --> 02:47:32,622
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing?

2525
02:47:33,082 --> 02:47:34,002
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Porkchop.

2526
02:47:34,022 --> 02:47:34,603
[SPEAKER_08]: What is up?

2527
02:47:34,823 --> 02:47:36,684
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've been trying to get through all night.

2528
02:47:36,704 --> 02:47:40,626
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost the shoutcast feed, so I have to switch between Ustream.

2529
02:47:40,646 --> 02:47:44,928
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing everything on my Android, so it's good to finally actually get through and start talking.

2530
02:47:44,948 --> 02:47:48,389
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, what happened wasn't ideal, unfortunately, but it is what it is.

2531
02:47:48,469 --> 02:47:50,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know.

2532
02:47:50,270 --> 02:47:56,213
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are having the night from hell, and it's supposed to be really nice as you're kind of moving on and that kind of thing, so it's got to be a pain in the ass.

2533
02:47:56,721 --> 02:47:57,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

2534
02:48:12,225 --> 02:48:16,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Our listeners are so awesome that they would just follow us to, oh shit, go to Ustream?

2535
02:48:16,349 --> 02:48:16,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we're there.

2536
02:48:17,290 --> 02:48:22,935
[SPEAKER_08]: And look at you, you're juggling your Android and you're trying to go to Ustream back and forth just so you can call.

2537
02:48:23,355 --> 02:48:24,436
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.

2538
02:48:24,456 --> 02:48:26,017
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the case at night, it's the morning.

2539
02:48:26,037 --> 02:48:27,299
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like 5 o'clock here.

2540
02:48:27,399 --> 02:48:31,462
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot to do tomorrow, but I decided to dedicate it at this stage.

2541
02:48:31,502 --> 02:48:32,804
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy the station.

2542
02:48:33,284 --> 02:48:34,225
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys are dedicated.

2543
02:48:34,525 --> 02:48:35,186
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, why not?

2544
02:48:35,786 --> 02:48:39,628
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish I could tell you that the show was going to be on earlier in the future, but that's not the case.

2545
02:48:39,668 --> 02:48:40,288
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry to say.

2546
02:48:40,948 --> 02:48:41,528
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care.

2547
02:48:41,548 --> 02:48:42,049
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.

2548
02:48:42,089 --> 02:48:42,849
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll still listen in.

2549
02:48:43,009 --> 02:48:48,991
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually wanted to say that, you know, I was going to ask what was so bad about Tekken 6?

2550
02:48:49,391 --> 02:48:51,152
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it wasn't all that bad of a game.

2551
02:48:51,192 --> 02:48:54,473
[SPEAKER_00]: Apart from the whole it's been chopped and changed a bit.

2552
02:48:54,513 --> 02:48:58,235
[SPEAKER_00]: I can understand that you don't have, you know, go get your characters anymore.

2553
02:48:58,755 --> 02:49:02,658
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2554
02:49:28,715 --> 02:49:33,717
[SPEAKER_08]: But we were just kind of playing it going, eh, this game's kind of, we're not, like, we're just not into it.

2555
02:49:33,797 --> 02:49:34,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I don't know what it is.

2556
02:49:35,058 --> 02:49:36,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Alan, can you explain?

2557
02:49:37,059 --> 02:49:40,480
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we did story mode or whatever with a few characters.

2558
02:49:40,600 --> 02:49:43,962
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, we didn't really recognize the roster.

2559
02:49:44,402 --> 02:49:46,663
[SPEAKER_05]: And there were a lot of characters, but no one felt interesting.

2560
02:49:46,703 --> 02:49:50,405
[SPEAKER_05]: And we played story mode a few times and beat the end boss.

2561
02:49:50,425 --> 02:49:52,285
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, this isn't really compelling us.

2562
02:49:53,246 --> 02:49:53,506
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't.

2563
02:49:53,766 --> 02:49:55,348
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of, I don't know, average.

2564
02:49:56,349 --> 02:49:58,331
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that... Yeah, I can kind of see where you're coming from.

2565
02:49:58,371 --> 02:50:02,935
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's more than Soul Calibur, to be honest, because you play that and in a few hours you're done.

2566
02:50:03,576 --> 02:50:06,218
[SPEAKER_00]: But, I mean, the Arena mode was very lacking.

2567
02:50:06,238 --> 02:50:14,927
[SPEAKER_00]: You just go in the scenario, you play through with these guys, and even though they're already in the fucking other modes, you can just play straight away.

2568
02:50:15,487 --> 02:50:19,529
[SPEAKER_00]: It still gives you the option to go get them and then you can play through or you can get the random movie.

2569
02:50:19,869 --> 02:50:24,071
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, you can just play a load of matches until you actually get those.

2570
02:50:24,571 --> 02:50:28,193
[SPEAKER_00]: Like every 10 matches you got like an ending or a scenario, movie, whatever.

2571
02:50:28,653 --> 02:50:37,257
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you make some good points but as a big Tekken fan, I mean graphically it was great and they kind of introduced some weird characters.

2572
02:50:37,797 --> 02:51:04,545
[SPEAKER_00]: but I mean I think they did okay with it and Tekken 7 yeah I mean and I'm a fan of Capcom don't get me wrong I like their games a lot of their games but you know let's hope they get better and as for the DLC that's great news as well I will say this I am super curious especially in light of the DLC news you know we did get Street Fighter X Tekken but remember they're supposed to be a Tekken X Street Fighter as a part of this Namco is going to get their chance too so I'm

2573
02:51:05,885 --> 02:51:07,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Really freaking curious.

2574
02:51:07,486 --> 02:51:15,828
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, I kind of hope that's one of the things that's coming out at E3 this year, you know, to get the first look at is the Tekken Cross Street Fighter.

2575
02:51:15,868 --> 02:51:17,449
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the other half going to look like?

2576
02:51:17,769 --> 02:51:18,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Because remember... Yeah, I lost.

2577
02:51:19,230 --> 02:51:19,710
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, go ahead.

2578
02:51:19,890 --> 02:51:23,851
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I was just going to say there was always Capcom versus SNK was a huge, huge, huge game.

2579
02:51:24,091 --> 02:51:26,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, there was also SNK versus Capcom that wasn't bad.

2580
02:51:26,832 --> 02:51:30,353
[SPEAKER_08]: It just didn't quite get that same, you know, didn't catch on.

2581
02:51:30,413 --> 02:51:31,294
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't a big fan.

2582
02:51:31,334 --> 02:51:35,215
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked the Capcom SNK games, but the other one, that's 3CKS, wasn't it?

2583
02:51:35,815 --> 02:51:37,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, SVC Chaos, that's right.

2584
02:51:37,976 --> 02:51:39,896
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was, I didn't really like the look of it.

2585
02:51:39,936 --> 02:51:43,477
[SPEAKER_00]: It looked very, you know, I was kind of like, you know, let's push the envelope a little bit.

2586
02:51:43,517 --> 02:51:44,818
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it didn't look great.

2587
02:51:45,158 --> 02:51:47,959
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really, you know, fall into that side of it.

2588
02:51:49,239 --> 02:51:50,839
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I had a point to make, I can't remember.

2589
02:51:51,680 --> 02:51:57,541
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, yeah, well, let's hope that, I mean, I saw the box art for Tekken X Street Fighter, whatever it was.

2590
02:51:58,642 --> 02:52:00,062
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's going to be a pretty cool game.

2591
02:52:00,422 --> 02:52:03,546
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hope they don't fuck up like Capcom did.

2592
02:52:03,907 --> 02:52:05,008
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave the shit on the disc.

2593
02:52:05,349 --> 02:52:06,731
[SPEAKER_00]: Hackers gonna hack and all that.

2594
02:52:06,891 --> 02:52:07,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, sir.

2595
02:52:08,152 --> 02:52:11,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Wyland in our chatroom says Tekken X Street Fighter is 10% complete.

2596
02:52:11,337 --> 02:52:13,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

2597
02:52:13,600 --> 02:52:17,325
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, I would like to point out that my personal favorite in the Tekken series was Tekken 3.

2598
02:52:17,785 --> 02:52:18,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Me too, absolutely.

2599
02:52:19,926 --> 02:52:20,606
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, yeah.

2600
02:52:20,626 --> 02:52:26,028
[SPEAKER_00]: Yoshimitsu never looked cooler, so he stuck through there to the next game, Street Fighter X Tekken.

2601
02:52:26,048 --> 02:52:27,769
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he looks the same as far as I remember.

2602
02:52:27,989 --> 02:52:30,270
[SPEAKER_07]: I used... I'm sorry, go ahead.

2603
02:52:30,750 --> 02:52:39,454
[SPEAKER_02]: I used Jin, and they changed his moves as of Tekken 4, which he had, like, my favorite Jun moves, and all the rest were Kazuya moves, and I was in love.

2604
02:52:40,014 --> 02:52:41,135
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah.

2605
02:52:41,235 --> 02:52:42,155
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually like both.

2606
02:52:42,235 --> 02:52:46,657
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think it's cool that, you know, because Kazuya was, in quotation marks, dead.

2607
02:52:47,237 --> 02:53:12,522
[SPEAKER_00]: you know that they actually stuck Jim in and said okay well here's his illegitimate son or whatever but the whole I hate my dad thing then in Tekken 4 um yeah why not I think I think the karate kind of looks cool when he does it but again you know you don't want too many characters with the same moves you got Heihachi and Kazooie are pretty much the same um yeah so it's fresh it's new it worked I think it worked for me anyway so I mean up to you if you like it or not

2608
02:53:13,524 --> 02:53:13,804
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2609
02:53:13,925 --> 02:53:16,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Porkchop, I got to let you go so we can wrap up the show.

2610
02:53:16,928 --> 02:53:18,470
[SPEAKER_08]: But I appreciate you sharing your perspective.

2611
02:53:18,650 --> 02:53:22,234
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing wrong with a friendly little talk about what games we do and don't like.

2612
02:53:22,574 --> 02:53:24,636
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Porkchop, take care, buddy, and thanks again for staying up late.

2613
02:53:24,877 --> 02:53:25,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

2614
02:53:25,638 --> 02:53:26,719
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the dream alive, guys.

2615
02:53:26,779 --> 02:53:27,199
[SPEAKER_08]: All the best.

2616
02:53:27,600 --> 02:53:27,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care, buddy.

2617
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:32,145
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say that the reason why it's only 10% done is because they're working on Tag 2 right now.

2618
02:53:34,484 --> 02:53:35,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

2619
02:53:35,285 --> 02:53:35,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

2620
02:53:35,766 --> 02:53:36,867
[SPEAKER_08]: That's supposed to be a big one.

2621
02:53:36,887 --> 02:53:39,470
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's going to come up on multiple consoles this year, isn't it?

2622
02:53:39,770 --> 02:53:40,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

2623
02:53:40,230 --> 02:53:40,951
[SPEAKER_08]: So, all right.

2624
02:53:41,932 --> 02:53:42,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me burn through.

2625
02:53:42,553 --> 02:53:43,834
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to close the Skype line.

2626
02:53:43,894 --> 02:53:45,396
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry to those that didn't get through.

2627
02:53:45,796 --> 02:53:46,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Very sorry.

2628
02:53:46,597 --> 02:53:49,480
[SPEAKER_08]: Please consider sending us an email, mailbag at orangelawntrader.com.

2629
02:53:49,540 --> 02:53:49,800
[SPEAKER_08]: Again...

2630
02:53:50,461 --> 02:53:51,381
[SPEAKER_08]: The show isn't ending.

2631
02:53:51,822 --> 02:53:53,022
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a very important point.

2632
02:53:53,062 --> 02:53:53,863
[SPEAKER_08]: The show isn't ending.

2633
02:53:53,943 --> 02:53:57,084
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll have a show just like always next week, especially podcasties.

2634
02:53:57,124 --> 02:54:00,366
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're listening on the podcast feed, you're going to be like, oh, next week?

2635
02:54:00,966 --> 02:54:09,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, same show, but I'm just hearing some slightly different websites given and some different things that will slowly unravel itself throughout the coming year.

2636
02:54:10,291 --> 02:54:13,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, back to some tweets.

2637
02:54:13,234 --> 02:54:18,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Tigerclaw also tweeted us, New Facebook lawsuit highlights trouble with kids and virtual currency.

2638
02:54:19,120 --> 02:54:19,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, God.

2639
02:54:20,581 --> 02:54:24,865
[SPEAKER_08]: I can only imagine how the kids can just rack up all this money so easily.

2640
02:54:24,925 --> 02:54:26,227
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of sick.

2641
02:54:27,087 --> 02:54:30,470
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, another complaint was filed against Facebook with the U.S.

2642
02:54:30,510 --> 02:54:31,210
[SPEAKER_08]: District Court.

2643
02:54:31,611 --> 02:54:34,313
[SPEAKER_08]: According to this link, the Tiger Claw sent us at Gamasutra.

2644
02:54:35,053 --> 02:54:39,537
[SPEAKER_08]: This isn't the only instance of companies getting in trouble over minors purchasing credits for social games.

2645
02:54:40,137 --> 02:54:40,738
[SPEAKER_08]: A U.S.

2646
02:54:40,778 --> 02:54:48,423
[SPEAKER_08]: District Judge upheld a handful of claims that Apple distributed free iOS apps that trick children into money in-app purchases.

2647
02:54:48,703 --> 02:54:48,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2648
02:54:51,806 --> 02:54:54,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Children are allowed to do Facebook accounts from the age of 13.

2649
02:54:54,868 --> 02:54:59,751
[SPEAKER_08]: However, if you're under the age of 18, you're supposed to ask for your parents' permission before buying Facebook credits.

2650
02:55:02,393 --> 02:55:04,274
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm surprised it's just not shut off altogether.

2651
02:55:04,695 --> 02:55:09,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Considering that you have to put your credit card information in, I believe that if you're 13, you don't have a credit card.

2652
02:55:09,878 --> 02:55:11,399
[SPEAKER_08]: How hard is it to open mom's wallet?

2653
02:55:12,180 --> 02:55:16,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, then that's a problem with fraud, and they should throw that kid in jail.

2654
02:55:17,183 --> 02:55:17,684
Yeah.

2655
02:55:18,224 --> 02:55:19,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Throw the kids in jail.

2656
02:55:20,565 --> 02:55:23,007
[SPEAKER_08]: SJ100Matt says, Hey, remember Para Para Paradise?

2657
02:55:23,107 --> 02:55:24,347
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, fuck yeah, I love that game.

2658
02:55:24,888 --> 02:55:29,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, a new Para-style arcade machine is coming out soon, and yes, it has Gaga.

2659
02:55:30,151 --> 02:55:34,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, because every freaking music game these days has to have Gaga.

2660
02:55:34,433 --> 02:55:36,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't get me wrong, I love Lady Gaga, but damn.

2661
02:55:36,994 --> 02:55:39,356
[SPEAKER_08]: Dance Core is the game, I guess, that's coming out.

2662
02:55:39,416 --> 02:55:42,277
[SPEAKER_08]: He links us to a little YouTube of somebody playing it.

2663
02:55:42,677 --> 02:55:43,198
Yeah!

2664
02:55:43,298 --> 02:55:43,838
[SPEAKER_09]: What is it?

2665
02:55:52,769 --> 02:55:53,470
[SPEAKER_08]: It just looks like something.

2666
02:55:53,490 --> 02:55:53,950
[SPEAKER_08]: K-pop!

2667
02:55:54,070 --> 02:55:54,991
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be on Kinect.

2668
02:55:55,852 --> 02:55:57,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe not in this country, but it'll be Kinect.

2669
02:55:58,514 --> 02:56:04,278
[SPEAKER_08]: But they say, yeah, they say in the article it's more closer to Power, Power, Paradise than it is like DDR or Dance Central or anything like that.

2670
02:56:05,379 --> 02:56:09,562
[SPEAKER_08]: Or maybe Dance Masters because that kind of had a lot of power in it.

2671
02:56:09,582 --> 02:56:09,902
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway.

2672
02:56:12,737 --> 02:56:15,278
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really... I think that's going to do it for tweets tonight.

2673
02:56:15,318 --> 02:56:16,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you guys for sending us tweets.

2674
02:56:16,518 --> 02:56:17,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

2675
02:56:17,919 --> 02:56:19,099
[SPEAKER_08]: But we've got to wrap up the show.

2676
02:56:19,139 --> 02:56:22,040
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got to wrap it... Oh, wait.

2677
02:56:22,140 --> 02:56:24,281
[SPEAKER_08]: I got one last tweet that came in.

2678
02:56:24,921 --> 02:56:27,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me read this one from GamerGirl.

2679
02:56:28,422 --> 02:56:30,603
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a question regarding GLBT.

2680
02:56:31,523 --> 02:56:34,624
[SPEAKER_08]: I know someone who is bi and they want to come out, so to speak.

2681
02:56:35,185 --> 02:56:36,445
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the best way to do so?

2682
02:56:37,806 --> 02:56:38,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Woo!

2683
02:56:38,806 --> 02:56:40,466
[SPEAKER_02]: You turn the knob, open the door.

2684
02:56:40,626 --> 02:56:41,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.

2685
02:56:41,947 --> 02:56:42,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

2686
02:56:44,153 --> 02:57:11,640
[SPEAKER_08]: I know there's a lot of you know obviously I'm speaking as the gay guy on the show I know there's a lot of society pressures that come with like coming out and all that stuff and sometimes it's one of those things people kind of feel like they kind of have to do to get it off their chest I really truly believe a shirt person should not feel like they're forced to do it until they're ready because taking that first step to really like come out to yourself can be one of the hardest things you have to do in that whole process

2687
02:57:12,260 --> 02:57:33,119
[SPEAKER_08]: so, you know, don't ever feel any pressure that you do or you don't have to do anything you know, for your friend, whoever your friend wants to love is their choice whoever your friend wants to have a relationship with is ultimately their choice you know, that's a private matter that is public when you want it to be public, your friend

2688
02:57:33,940 --> 02:57:36,822
[SPEAKER_08]: So they want to come out or whatever.

2689
02:57:36,862 --> 02:57:38,083
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the best way to do so?

2690
02:57:38,203 --> 02:57:40,665
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to tell the people that are closest to you.

2691
02:57:41,025 --> 02:57:44,848
[SPEAKER_08]: True friends are not going to turn the other way.

2692
02:57:45,749 --> 02:57:50,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Some may kind of say, you know, I'm always kind of suspected, but it doesn't really change anything.

2693
02:57:50,592 --> 02:57:54,635
[SPEAKER_08]: I had the really good fortune that when I came out, everybody was supportive.

2694
02:57:54,655 --> 02:57:57,437
[SPEAKER_08]: There was very few people that I got into shit with.

2695
02:57:57,477 --> 02:58:00,680
[SPEAKER_08]: And anybody that was a problem, ain't in my life anymore.

2696
02:58:00,940 --> 02:58:01,340
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

2697
02:58:02,401 --> 02:58:02,721
[SPEAKER_08]: You know?

2698
02:58:03,281 --> 02:58:07,423
[SPEAKER_08]: But there's been a lot of great people that most people I know just don't really care.

2699
02:58:08,003 --> 02:58:09,523
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's fine.

2700
02:58:09,963 --> 02:58:10,663
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say this.

2701
02:58:10,683 --> 02:58:16,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of my friends that came out and told me, I was usually like, duh.

2702
02:58:17,165 --> 02:58:22,387
[SPEAKER_08]: The fact that it's bi and not gay can be a really tricky line to walk as well.

2703
02:58:23,447 --> 02:58:44,838
[SPEAKER_08]: and you know that could be a lot you know this could be somebody who's still questioning in a lot of ways and says maybe I'm having these type of tendencies you know or whatever all I'm saying don't ever don't ever feel like whoever you are you have to pigeonhole yourself into one bucket or another or whatever just love somebody

2704
02:58:46,099 --> 02:59:03,341
[SPEAKER_08]: and you know my best preferably yourself first yeah oh yeah absolutely starting with yourself accept yourself and everybody else will come easy that's the best advice I can give love yourself first then those closest to you and your true friends will show their colors now can I say the witty thing yes

2705
02:59:04,340 --> 02:59:06,883
[SPEAKER_02]: For the ones that come easy, some people are easy.

2706
02:59:07,684 --> 02:59:08,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop.

2707
02:59:08,985 --> 02:59:09,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Stop.

2708
02:59:09,526 --> 02:59:09,766
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2709
02:59:10,747 --> 02:59:11,128
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it.

2710
02:59:11,188 --> 02:59:11,989
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it for tweets.

2711
02:59:12,049 --> 02:59:14,051
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it for Skype calls.

2712
02:59:14,111 --> 02:59:15,253
[SPEAKER_08]: That's it for the show.

2713
02:59:16,774 --> 02:59:21,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you guys for staying up late with us on what has been a very interesting episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2714
02:59:22,861 --> 02:59:25,242
[SPEAKER_08]: and a new chapter starts next week.

2715
02:59:25,922 --> 02:59:28,063
[SPEAKER_08]: And can't wait to tell you all the details a little later.

2716
02:59:29,563 --> 02:59:37,106
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll stay tuned to our Twitter feed, twitter.com slash OLR, our Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio, our website, of course, orangelaunchradio.com.

2717
02:59:37,466 --> 02:59:41,267
[SPEAKER_08]: All the details in the coming days will be on the website.

2718
02:59:42,627 --> 02:59:44,308
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all I have to say for now on that.

2719
02:59:45,148 --> 02:59:50,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyhow, everything else about the whole situation will be in the podcast feed.

2720
02:59:50,851 --> 02:59:56,533
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to replay the call that happened with Bobby and I think everything else we had to say on it is all contained in there.

2721
02:59:57,614 --> 03:00:01,275
[SPEAKER_08]: In the meantime, let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.

2722
03:00:01,755 --> 03:00:02,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, your final thoughts tonight.

2723
03:00:03,476 --> 03:00:15,705
[SPEAKER_07]: This is really strange, but there was this kid, because I took Josh to the park today, practicing his unicycle, which begged the question, if a bicycle can be shortened to a bike, would a unicycle be a eunuch?

2724
03:00:19,488 --> 03:00:20,369
[SPEAKER_09]: My final thought is...

2725
03:00:27,687 --> 03:00:34,878
[SPEAKER_08]: I felt this weekend that I have a lot of drama in my life right now, but I feel really good tonight.

2726
03:00:35,459 --> 03:00:37,141
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to thank all of you for being a part of that.

2727
03:00:37,842 --> 03:00:38,323
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura?

2728
03:00:38,964 --> 03:00:40,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Because people will shoot me if I don't say it.

2729
03:00:41,027 --> 03:00:42,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Reject false icons.

2730
03:00:44,223 --> 03:00:45,624

[SPEAKER_04]: See you next week!
