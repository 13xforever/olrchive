00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,160
Tonight, April 29, 2012, the release date leaks for one big game this fall, Nintendo

2
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,280
will bring retail digital downloads to the Wii U, and could Microsoft be planning another

3
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:31,800
music service?

4
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,480
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to the show where every gamer

5
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,840
has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

6
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:48,520
We are live as we are every week at VOG Network, vognetwork.com, six o'clock Pacific, nine

7
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,960
o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

8
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,840
You can join us in our chat room at vognetwork.com.

9
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,880
I'll be talking more about the chat and some of those changes in just a minute, but my

10
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,560
name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video

11
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,920
games and lols.

12
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,000
With my co-host, say hello to the one and only, Jamie Summers.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Hi.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
How are you?

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Voggy.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,160
Wait a minute, this isn't a station about volcanic fog.

17
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,280
Wikipedia told me vog is volcanic fog.

18
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,280
What is this?

19
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,840
Wikipedia is wrong.

20
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,680
Alright, also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

21
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,680
Hello.

22
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,680
How you doing, Loki?

23
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,680
I'm full.

24
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,680
You're full, full of crap.

25
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,600
That's the same joke I made with her last week.

26
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,760
I just ate a big pizza.

27
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,120
I just ate some dried okra.

28
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,000
And I have breadsticks staring at me, but I can't, I can literally not fit any more

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,160
into my stomach.

30
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,160
So some things never change.

31
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,160
Some things change, but some things never change.

32
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,720
So I am getting hungry, but just looking at those breadsticks is making me hungry.

33
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,940
Alright, so before we get into our gaming weeks, let's talk about the big obvious thing

34
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:50,940
that's out there.

35
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,920
We weren't able to talk about it last week because we were trying to transition from

36
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,160
the old network to our new network.

37
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,420
And we're not bitches.

38
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,720
Which is VOG.

39
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,720
And if you haven't heard, it's all over now, Geek-Life.com.

40
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,440
Big thank you to Geek Life, by the way, for doing this for us.

41
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:11,680
Broke the exclusive late last night that the new network that we were starting with Bobby

42
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,640
and Understation Live will also be a part of in its inaugural phase is called VOG, or

43
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,280
the Voice of Geeks Network.

44
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,340
You know, so you can call it Voice of Geeks Network if you want, but ultimately when you

45
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,720
think of VOG, you won't think of volcanoes anymore, you'll think about our network or

46
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,960
the Voice of Geeks Network, which is expanding a little bit, just like when Orange Lounge

47
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,480
Radio, remember Orange Lounge Radio was a station when it first started.

48
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,800
So in some ways this is going back to those roots a little bit, but so much bigger now.

49
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,800
Our eyes are...

50
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,800
We started over.

51
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,800
That's right.

52
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,120
We are starting over.

53
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,840
You know, it's not just about Bomani, it's not just about games, it's about all things

54
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,200
geek is what this station is all about.

55
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,160
And you know, that's going to be reflected in the playlist, that's going to be reflected

56
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,280
in, you know, the shows that you're going to hear on the network, and most importantly,

57
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,020
it's not just a radio network.

58
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:07,480
The VOG network is going to be a whole website that has other things as well, forums and

59
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,300
you know, other ways to interact with folks and some really exciting maybe meta games.

60
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,400
I don't want to spoil too much, but just say there's great things in store for VOG.

61
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,360
The site that you see there now at vognetwork.com, kind of a temporary, what we call the phase

62
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,360
one, so that you guys have a way to continue to listen to us.

63
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,640
And so that way our shows aren't interrupted at all, but the later phases are going to

64
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,640
bring more.

65
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,780
More shows to the radio network, more things to see and do on the website.

66
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,040
It's going to be great.

67
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,960
So going to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

68
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,560
Let's see, who do I give the first chat comment to tonight?

69
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,600
I'm going to give it to Hecht, who calls VOG the voice of God network.

70
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,200
No, that's a whole other network.

71
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,360
That might be, you know, got to go through the religious programming to get that.

72
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,540
And if you pay us $50,000, you'll be guaranteed a place in heaven.

73
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:07,080
Speaking of chat, we're saying goodbye to our old chat room, which was at chat.orangeloungeradio.com,

74
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,660
and it was Channel Orange Lounge on IRC.

75
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,240
We're saying goodbye to that.

76
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:15,400
And I know some people are like, I don't like change, why do things have to change?

77
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:21,400
But we wanted to, you know, for a long time when we were at our old home, we had one chat

78
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,120
room, they had another, and things always felt really disconnected.

79
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,060
And it was a little weird.

80
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,840
So we wanted to make sure this time we did it right, and we merge into the general network

81
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,840
chat room.

82
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,660
Especially the fact that the shows that are all starting this network have a lot of listener

83
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,080
overlap anyway.

84
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,860
It really made sense to kind of have a central home or a hub for that.

85
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,580
So our new chat room is Channel VOG.

86
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,960
It's still on the game search network, and if you want to join it really easy using the

87
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,520
Java or whatever, the chat client online, just go to vognetwork.com.

88
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,980
It's like, you can't miss it.

89
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,980
It's right in front of your face.

90
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,860
It's like the biggest thing on the page right now, vognetwork.com, and you will see the

91
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,040
chat.

92
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,920
You don't have to use vognetwork.com to listen to the station.

93
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,760
You have little things that you can copy paste into Winamp and mobile phones and all that.

94
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,320
That is going to be developing all through the coming weeks.

95
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,140
I do want to put this out there for the podcast listeners.

96
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:20,200
Those that are listening on the podcast, nothing's changed for them.

97
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,920
They're just like, oh, hey, another week, another show.

98
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,920
Here it is.

99
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,960
It sounds the same as it always has, and that's the intention.

100
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,920
It's not supposed to sound any different to you guys.

101
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,900
If you do happen to visit VOG Network during the week, keep in mind we don't have the stream

102
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,540
up 24-7 yet.

103
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,400
That is part of phase two that's going to be implemented within the next couple weeks.

104
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,400
It's going to be fast.

105
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,720
I just don't want you to be surprised if you go to vognetwork.com and it's not Saturday

106
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,720
night or Sunday night, because Saturday is when another station live is on, Sunday is

107
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,060
when we're on with Bobby, you're not going to hear anything.

108
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,880
That's going to be that way for a couple weeks.

109
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,200
We're slowly expanding with the network.

110
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,840
I'm so excited.

111
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,840
It's great.

112
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,320
Sitting at the driver's wheel, being part of having created this, getting to steer this

113
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:08,360
site in the direction we want to take it for geeks everywhere, and giving everybody a voice

114
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,800
through radio shows, through feature articles, through forums.

115
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,540
It's going to be awesome.

116
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,540
So excited.

117
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:20,040
All right, so anyhow, let's get back into video games and talk about our gaming week

118
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,800
and so forth, and the stuff we've been playing in the gaming world this week.

119
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,160
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

120
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,160
I ain't played shit.

121
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,160
No, I'm kidding.

122
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,160
What?

123
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,240
Well, and then I reformatted my hard drive and installed Windows 7, only to find out

124
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:41,560
that I'm missing my entire iTunes collection from about S down, including my ringtones

125
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,560
directory.

126
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,640
So I've lost most of the ringtones that I've made, including my Doctor Who theme from season

127
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,240
10, which makes me irritated beyond all belief.

128
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,240
Well, this is the interweb.

129
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,760
Surely you can find that in a heartbeat.

130
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,960
I made that one.

131
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,160
And the VoG network probably has it in the upcoming playlist.

132
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:04,040
For anyone who I've ever sent those ringtones to, just send them back to me, please.

133
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:07,080
So I played some WoW.

134
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,480
I've finally gotten the beta.

135
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,600
Well, I mean, I had the beta key, I just wasn't beta-ing.

136
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,960
Now I am beta-ing.

137
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,460
I've made a panda named Sakurina.

138
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:24,400
Every time I try to play my 85s that I transferred over, the game crashes on me.

139
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,760
Oops.

140
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,660
So yeah.

141
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:36,000
And then we were loaned the Tekken Street Fighter poop game, because my friend bought

142
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,320
it on PS3 and promptly said, this is broken, and loaned it to us.

143
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,400
He said, you can play it, I hate it.

144
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:49,240
So we were going to play it, but things have been busy with me trying to do everything.

145
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,840
And Tigerclaw, I backed up my entire iTunes directory, let it finish, double-checked it,

146
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,480
and somehow half of it was still missing.

147
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,800
So shut up.

148
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,360
You're so nice.

149
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,520
I know.

150
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,520
I'm a wonderful person.

151
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:06,720
By the way, Tigerclaw had suggested that this is why I make a backup of my entire iTunes

152
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,400
library on a second hard drive.

153
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,040
That's what I did.

154
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:19,920
So anyway, at any rate, it's just been me trying to play catch-up and working, and I

155
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,880
have two more weeks of school.

156
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,880
Then I'm going to Disneyland.

157
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,880
Oh.

158
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,880
Oh, congrats.

159
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,280
I wish I could go, but I don't think it's going to work out, just with everything else

160
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,280
going on.

161
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,280
Yeah.

162
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,280
Okay.

163
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,280
LOL, bye.

164
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,280
Bye.

165
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,280
You want to feature me for me?

166
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,280
Yeah, we can talk about that offline.

167
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,280
Why not?

168
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,280
All right.

169
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,280
Techmaster Loki, how was your gaming week?

170
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,280
What'd you do?

171
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:43,080
I played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3.

172
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,080
That's pretty much it.

173
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:51,400
Leveled up to 80 offline through some grinding with split-screen Surge and Destroy, which

174
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,440
is a lot faster than the way I was trying to do it.

175
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,600
So we did that, and it's sort of cheating, but who cares?

176
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,960
We're playing offline, so it doesn't matter.

177
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,760
So yeah, that's pretty much all I've played, and then I've been continuing, because I had

178
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:14,040
started it, god, months ago, but I have been continuing on working on my full-size Papercraft

179
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:19,920
model of a Portal turret that's about three and a half feet tall, when it will be three

180
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,640
and a half feet tall when it's done.

181
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,600
So I posted a picture in the chat room.

182
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:32,600
What I have done so far is pretty much the two shells of the actual body minus the gun

183
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,040
doors on there, because those are actually separate pieces, and you can actually make

184
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,960
it with the guns, but I'm not.

185
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,160
I'm just going to keep the doors shut.

186
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,160
Makes it easier.

187
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,040
By the way, we probably should get Rama to put that to the Tumblr, so the podcast listeners

188
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,760
can see this thing that you're building.

189
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,760
We can do it.

190
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,760
All right.

191
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,680
What made you decide you wanted to build this?

192
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,680
Because you can't.

193
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,680
I've known you how long.

194
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,680
Because you can.

195
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,680
You're like, challenge?

196
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,680
Challenge accepted!

197
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,200
It's because it's the cheapest way to get in.

198
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,280
How can I annoy my wife this month?

199
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,980
It's not annoying.

200
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,480
It was actually, this was the cheapest way to go.

201
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,080
This is one of the least annoying projects, I'm sure.

202
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,080
It's just cutting paper.

203
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,400
I mean, it's actually, I think it's cost me so far like 20 bucks, and that's only because

204
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,320
I bought the wrong thickness paper at one point.

205
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:29,820
But it's just like card stock with glue, the special glue because it's quick drying and

206
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,640
works great.

207
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,760
And then just an X-Acto blade and stuff, but it's coming out pretty well.

208
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:41,560
The only thing is, once I'm done putting it together, I've got to spray it because it's

209
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:47,160
got lines all over the place, and then once I'm done spraying it, I have to possibly add

210
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,040
a laser and voice to it as well.

211
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,720
And then you should sell it for a lot of money on Etsy.

212
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
No!

213
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,720
It's going to my desk!

214
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,440
And it's not going to be just a regular Portal turret.

215
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,600
It's going to be the, what is it, the one from Portal 2 that you save.

216
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,560
Excuse me, excuse me!

217
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,200
No, that sounds awesome.

218
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,840
I can't wait to see the finished product.

219
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,000
I know you'll bring it to the show.

220
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I will bring it to the show.

221
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I know you will.

222
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,280
It'll be great.

223
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,280
So that whole video content we want to add to VOG eventually, there'll just be a static

224
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,600
camera pointing at your Portal gun.

225
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,600
Sounds good.

226
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Very ominous.

227
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,840
Alright, so my gaming week.

228
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,720
I wish, I was reading some of the comments in chat room, and earlier somebody had brought

229
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:27,840
up Phantasy Star Online 2, and the whole beta that's going on.

230
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,720
I wish I was playing that, but I guess it's only in Japanese right now, which stinks.

231
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,720
I really want to check that out at some point.

232
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,280
I've had a lot of friends beta testing MMOs this week.

233
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,400
Guild Wars 2 apparently has got their thing going on for people that pre-purchased the

234
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,400
game.

235
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,240
Like, if you already gave them your money, you get to play the game a little early.

236
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,600
It's like an open beta test.

237
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,480
I was going to say, isn't it coming out soon?

238
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,800
Yeah, it's pretty soon.

239
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,720
I am interested in the game, and for those that remember Irene, she used to go by Rice

240
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,920
Princess years ago on this show.

241
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,200
If you remember Irene, she's really into Guild Wars, especially this new one, and she says

242
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,440
the PVP is awesome.

243
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,280
So I'm curious to check that out.

244
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,000
Xtaphir from Hoard House has been playing Terra, which is apparently pretty good.

245
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,740
You can make some very fancy pants looking characters in Terra, so I want to check that

246
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,440
out too, because the graphics in that look really good.

247
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,080
But the MMO that's been taking up my week is of course World of Warcraft.

248
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,320
Hello, what else?

249
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,840
But I have been playing some offline games as well on the Xbox 360, and again, note the

250
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,680
day, note the time, other big news besides the new network.

251
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,440
I didn't just beat one game this year, you guys.

252
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,560
I beat two games this year!

253
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,560
Applause, please.

254
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,560
Good job.

255
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,560
Thank you.

256
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,560
Good job.

257
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,760
So Mass Effect, right, and the new game I beat, Mass Effect 2.

258
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,880
Congratulations, your freight train of soon or intimate disappointment is full speed ahead.

259
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,520
Here's my quote for you.

260
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,680
Yeah, thank you, thank you.

261
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,800
So of course, the other day, I think that was what, probably Monday?

262
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,240
But Rob, when are you going to beat a game that came out this year?

263
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:09,920
Well, well, smartass, I just started Mass Effect 3!

264
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,000
Go figure, it was on sale for 40 bucks a couple weeks ago, so I picked up a copy of Mass Effect

265
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,360
3, so I had it ready to go, and away I went.

266
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:24,200
So I've been playing that a little bit, and I gotta say, just like some things, some little

267
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,000
things changed from Mass Effect 1 to Mass Effect 2, more things changed from Mass Effect

268
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,400
3, and I'm really loving it.

269
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:38,000
Oh my gosh, the story is great, there's much more direct tie-ins to what, like, you see

270
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,760
much more impact from what happened in Game 2, in Game 3, than you really saw between

271
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,760
1 and 2.

272
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,920
It's like they perfected that a little bit, and thankfully, since I say, I may or may

273
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,680
not have had my boyfriend walk me through the final sequence of Part 2, so that way

274
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,520
everybody would stay alive so I could see them in Part 3, so it's really cool getting

275
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:03,080
to run into everybody and see them in Part 3, and, you know, just the combat is so much

276
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,080
better.

277
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,720
Like, even though they didn't really change a lot, like it's still, you know, you have

278
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,640
your guns and use your powers, everything just feels more fluid, like I can't explain

279
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,000
it, like, and just the graphics are up a notch, it's great, I'm having such a good time with

280
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
3.

281
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,080
And, here's the crazy part, I'm playing multiplayer, because Mass Effect 3 has a whole multiplayer

282
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,600
thing online that you can go in, and it's basically, it's all co-op, it's not competitive,

283
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:34,280
you basically do these 4-player co-op matches, and, you know, it's not, it's not as rich

284
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:38,680
and as full as the main game, but you know that whole thing that apparently every game

285
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,080
has to have multiplayer these days, especially if you're EA, right?

286
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,400
So, Mass Effect now has this multiplayer mode, and it's basically 4-player co-op surviving

287
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:52,880
10 waves on a map, and it's 10 waves of enemies, but that could be, you know, little enemies,

288
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:58,200
big enemies, it could be hold a point on the map for a minute, it could be go find the

289
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,880
different markers on the map and activate the beacons or whatever, within a certain

290
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,600
amount of time, there are little modes that they put in it.

291
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,080
But the fact that it's co-op makes it really interesting.

292
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,540
Now, so I've said a lot of great things about Mass Effect 3, right, and I really do truly

293
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:16,320
love this game, and even if the ending blows ass, which I'm fully expecting it to, I've

294
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,400
already been set up for disappointment, the experience of getting there is fine, like

295
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,960
I feel like, especially because I bought it on sale, it's been money well spent.

296
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:30,760
By the way, even though I bought these games on sale, I bought every single DLC, well every

297
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:38,200
single like story DLC for part 2, and I beat all of those as well, Shadow Broker, Arrival,

298
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:43,700
Overlord, Kasumi, Zaid, I played all of it, so yeah, and that was a very important thing

299
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,320
I had to do before I started 3.

300
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,760
So, speaking of online and DLC, here's my problem with Mass Effect 3, and this is a

301
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:58,160
big problem, and this is my, this is why I'm going to be hesitant to give this my game

302
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:05,560
of the year, extremely hesitant to give this my game of the year award, and it's basically

303
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,760
the blatant money grab the EA is going for with this.

304
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:15,760
In multiplayer, you don't level the same character that you level in single player.

305
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,920
You level your character in multiplayer, and the way you do that is that you earn credits

306
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,480
with every map that you do.

307
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,000
The more waves you survive, the more you contribute, the more credits you get, and if you manage

308
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,680
to make it all the way to the end and get airlifted out, you get a lot of credits.

309
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,200
And you use the credits to buy little boxes that are akin to like a Magic the Gathering

310
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,340
booster pack.

311
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:41,600
You can buy a cheapy box for 5,000 that'll have cheapy stuff in it, you can buy a slightly

312
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,620
better box for 20,000 credits that has, you know, better stuff and are rare, and then

313
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:52,220
you can buy like a jumbo box for 60,000 that has like super rare or whatever in it, I'm

314
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,880
kind of paraphrasing here.

315
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,640
But where am I going with this?

316
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:02,040
Not only can you buy the boxes with in-game credits, but you can buy the boxes with Microsoft

317
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,120
points, and I'm assuming on the PlayStation 3 you can buy it with, you know, PlayStation

318
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,640
store dollars, and on the PC I'm sure you can tap into their EA network and buy them

319
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,640
as well.

320
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,640
So, in other words, you can use money to get ahead in the game.

321
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:22,640
And the other thing that's a little bit irritating with that is that if you want the A-plus best

322
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,080
way to get through the game, you really have to play multiplayer, because multiplayer ties

323
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:32,120
into this event called Galactic Readiness that starts at half, 50%.

324
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,920
The more you play multiplayer, the more the Galactic Readiness goes up.

325
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:42,360
Technically, you can get the best ending if you did everything perfect in Mass Effect

326
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,880
1, everything perfect in Mass Effect 2, like you'd have to use a guide online to do it.

327
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:49,320
You would absolutely have to use a guide online in order to be able to do it and never touch

328
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,320
multiplayer.

329
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,600
So, in other words, if you want the best ending, which as I understand there isn't that big

330
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,220
of a difference anyway between them, but by the time the DLC comes out maybe that'll change.

331
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:03,800
If you want the best in single player, you have to play multiplayer, and real money gives

332
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:08,960
you the edge in order to kind of get there as fast as possible, because they didn't already

333
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,040
take your money when you bought the game.

334
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,680
It makes me not want to play.

335
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,800
It's kind of shitty.

336
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:23,440
And that EA, that's why you make gamers so angry that they rigged that poll to go vote

337
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,160
you the worst company in America whether you deserved it or not.

338
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,040
That's the problem.

339
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,960
And I think it needs to be called out, because guess what, gaming industry?

340
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,880
You can't have your cake and eat it too.

341
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,200
You don't get to charge people that type of money for a game up front and the additional

342
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,100
DLC and then charge the money for Pokemon packs.

343
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,100
And I know what you're saying.

344
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,880
Well, if you don't like it, then don't buy it.

345
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,200
Rob, it's only gonna get worse.

346
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,200
I know.

347
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,760
I mean, we're gonna get into it later, but we've already gotten a glimpse of the future

348
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,520
and it's only gonna get worse.

349
00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:00,560
AcidicVampire in chat says, yes, but Rob, buying them with money is just an option.

350
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,760
If you beat them multiplayer on silver and gold, you will be swimming in credits.

351
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,320
And I understand that.

352
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,000
But there's some people that aren't gonna wanna play multiplayer that are gonna be tempted

353
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,400
to do that to give them an edge.

354
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,400
Why?

355
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,080
Because it ultimately does affect single player.

356
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,080
And I think that's a very...

357
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,080
I hate multiplayer.

358
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,080
See, that's a poor decision.

359
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,080
That was a...

360
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,080
I don't...

361
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,960
Any way you slice it, having the multiplayer tie in that close to single player was a poor

362
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,960
decision.

363
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,680
I really don't wanna play it now.

364
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,600
I mean, honestly, it just has deflated any desire how to play it.

365
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,520
Well, I think you're robbing yourself of what is otherwise an excellent story and an excellent

366
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,520
game.

367
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,520
To be honest, I mean...

368
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,520
I hate multiplayer games.

369
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,440
Unless they're in the house with me.

370
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,040
Technically, you don't have to play multiplayer, you just won't get the best ending.

371
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,040
Exactly.

372
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,280
Well, even the best ending, it doesn't even matter, because you can actually play multiplayer.

373
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,240
Well, you wouldn't have to buy those packs necessarily to get the experience that you

374
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,240
need.

375
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,960
But like, I mean, there's some other games, Saints Row the Third, that just have really

376
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:01,160
shitty DLC that they put out at a really expensive amount of money just so that you get more

377
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,120
content to the game and it's just terrible.

378
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,520
It's only like 30 minutes.

379
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,320
Or, hey, we're teasing that there's a character that you love that we decided, hey, we're

380
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,480
gonna fuck you guys up and kill him in the very beginning of the game.

381
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,320
Oh, but he's gonna come back, but not really.

382
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,080
But we're gonna tell you that he's coming back so that you buy this $7 piece of crap.

383
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,760
Tiger Claw in our chatroom says, you don't need to play multiplayer to get the best ending.

384
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,720
There's an app you can download on your iPhone or iPad that will help increase the galactic

385
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,720
readiness rating.

386
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,720
All right.

387
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,720
I was not aware of that.

388
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,840
And Tiger Claw does say the app is free.

389
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,840
Okay.

390
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,840
That makes me feel a little better.

391
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,800
I didn't know that up front, so I apologize.

392
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,840
However, my point about the whole nickel and diming and you don't get to make your game

393
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:45,400
a free-to-play Facebook game and charge 60 bucks for it point still stands.

394
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:52,800
Like you're allowing people to buy a competitive edge when it leaves a very bad taste in my

395
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,800
mouth.

396
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,800
Yeah.

397
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,080
Defend Mass Effect all you want.

398
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:03,280
I still say it's a great game, great story, awesome characters, wonderful gameplay, but

399
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,480
this is a shitty choice.

400
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,480
All right.

401
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,720
I'm looking at this app now.

402
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,280
Take your galaxy with you wherever you go.

403
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,280
Okay.

404
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,640
You know, the galaxy is in Orion's ball.

405
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:20,080
A City Vampire also says technically you could play the multiplayer by yourself to up the

406
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,080
galactic readiness.

407
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,080
Yeah.

408
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,320
But I did two player, which is me and Shane yesterday.

409
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:31,040
And we survived a wave three and we were really excited that we got that far.

410
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,040
Yes.

411
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,040
So I misquoted that it's the galaxy is in Orion's belt.

412
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,640
It's been a while since I saw him in black.

413
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,640
All right.

414
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,000
So, so all that bitching aside, Mass Effect three is still going to be one of the year's

415
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,240
best games.

416
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,180
I just think I, I'm, I'm side IEA.

417
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,440
I'm looking at UEA.

418
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,840
This is a shitty choice.

419
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,580
If game designers continue to go down this path, this is what's going to cause the next

420
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:57,840
game crash watch this and the no use thing and everything.

421
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,560
All these other money grabs gaming companies are trying to do in this economy is going

422
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,560
to take it.

423
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,560
This is money grabbing light.

424
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,560
Okay.

425
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:07,160
This is nothing compared to some of the crap that they're pulling right now.

426
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,320
I mean, Skylanders, Skylanders.

427
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:16,120
I'm telling you right there, that right there is seriously the tiny pebble that is rolling

428
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,120
down the hill.

429
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,840
That's going to, you know, turn into this giant snowball that will kill the industry.

430
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,440
That right there, that one game, because it was successful because idiots bought these

431
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,960
stupid toys.

432
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,240
That is what's going to fucking ruin this industry and you think DLC is bad now.

433
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,040
Oh, you have not seen anything yet.

434
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,080
By the way, I downloaded the app.

435
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,600
And I want to point out, you did just say in chat, the app has restored your desire

436
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,600
to play it.

437
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,160
Just to make that clear for listeners, knowing that there is a free option makes you feel

438
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,160
a little better.

439
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:49,040
Well, and on top of that too, I mean, I just started, I finished my first month of my job

440
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,800
and I have two weeks left of school.

441
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:55,380
So really I've had no concentration.

442
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,560
What is this real life stuff I'm hearing?

443
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,560
Excuse me.

444
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,560
I'm just kidding.

445
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,440
Video games are how to escape all that.

446
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,440
Bitch please.

447
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:09,000
When the job that you work requires your brain and then you have to use your brain some more,

448
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,480
the brain does not have much juice left to think about multiplayer and, and shooting

449
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,480
things.

450
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,440
And I don't even ever want to play.

451
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,440
Wow.

452
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,440
So.

453
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,440
All right.

454
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,440
Anyhow.

455
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,360
Um, that's it for my gaming week.

456
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,360
Really massive victory.

457
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,160
Oh no, I guess I should give one other little shout out quick, quick one guys.

458
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,160
Quick one.

459
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,160
And then we can get into the news.

460
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,160
Um, I will say quickly.

461
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:35,200
I watched a friend of mine last night play silent Hill downpour, which is the new silent

462
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,200
Hill game.

463
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,200
I went to a friend's house to watch and play it.

464
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
It was all right.

465
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,560
Like the graphics were really good.

466
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,680
The graphics are really good.

467
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,180
There were some things about it that made me laugh.

468
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:50,140
Like in the very opening sequence, there's this guy you have to kill and like you stab

469
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:53,080
him with a knife in the, in his back literally.

470
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,440
And he's running around the room that you're in.

471
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,460
And the way that he's running is so hilariously bad.

472
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:04,600
You can't help but like face Palm and go, Oh God, Konami, what have you done?

473
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,680
Uh, there's a lot of, I mean, I, you can't judge the whole game based off that one like

474
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:13,600
silly part, you know, otherwise, and plus I didn't really spend quality time with it

475
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,520
and I wasn't the one playing, but look and ambience aside, it is, it does seem like there's

476
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,520
a lot, they got right.

477
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,780
Like there were some, Oh shit moments, like there's a part where he's walking across this

478
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:27,660
fallen tree that like, you know, he might fall at any minute and then he like a twig

479
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:32,200
snaps off the tree and goes plummeting down, you know, cheap ass scares like that, that

480
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:35,120
you come to love out of, you know, playing these scary video games.

481
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,840
There are some cool little things like that.

482
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,760
So I didn't play enough of the game to really tell you if it's worth it or not, but I will

483
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,000
tell you, my friend seems to be enjoying it.

484
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:48,640
You know, it's not silent Hill two or silent Hill three, but let's be real.

485
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,740
It, nothing ever will be shit silent Hill two and three that just came out last month

486
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,740
isn't silent Hill two and three anymore.

487
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:01,960
So if you can let that go, I think this is a pretty decent game from what I understand.

488
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,960
It actually did occur to me.

489
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,320
There was some other gaming that went on at my house, Dan playing through, um, Gradius

490
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,320
three.

491
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,320
Yeah.

492
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:13,840
And me failing miserably at our type, just saying.

493
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,840
Sorry to hear that.

494
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:18,240
Sorry to hear that just because I wanted to hear the level one music and then when I'm

495
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,720
done with level one, it's kind of like, I don't want to play anymore.

496
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,720
All right.

497
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,060
Uh, go to our chat room at vog network.com if you want to join us as we are live on this

498
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:31,920
Sunday evening as we will be every week from here on out at the vog network, vog network.com

499
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:37,080
Uh, looking through some comments in chat, zither says, I heard the silent Hill HD collection

500
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,080
sucks.

501
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,080
Yeah.

502
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,080
I heard that too.

503
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,080
Uh, it did suck.

504
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,520
Um, unfortunately like something about the, I mean, I haven't played it myself, but just

505
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,320
what I'm reading isn't good.

506
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,600
Apparently next gen consoles can't handle last gen fog.

507
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,600
That's ridiculous.

508
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,600
Downpour.

509
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,560
I watched played on a PS three and it had plenty of fog.

510
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:01,600
And here's the thing is if you can't render the fog, then why bother releasing the game?

511
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:08,240
It's like if you can't create, uh, an emulator or whatever to run the old code, then don't

512
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,480
do it.

513
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,240
Just don't release a broken game.

514
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,060
Uh, stand in our chat room asks, how was the music?

515
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:18,120
Because as you know, Akira Yomoka is no longer with Konami, so he has nothing to do with

516
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,360
these games now, which, you know, some say is, is the reason why they're, they're not

517
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,360
so good anymore.

518
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,740
Uh, the music was composed by, I think his name is Daniel Licht and he does the music

519
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,740
for Dexter.

520
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:32,160
Um, it, the, the parts that I heard again in my limited, uh, viewing was, um, decent

521
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,160
enough.

522
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:41,240
It was enough of a cop drama TV show mixed with some of the little themes, like the little,

523
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,000
that little thing that you hear in the beginning, a little mandolin or whatever.

524
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,120
Like it's, it's enough of those kind of mixed together as the elements.

525
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,360
But again, if you're going to go into the game going, the music, I just know nothing

526
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,800
is going to compare to Akira Yomoka.

527
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,520
This game is never going to compare to Akira Yomoka.

528
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:58,440
If you're not willing to take those blinders off and go, okay, it's a new game.

529
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,920
Let's just deal with what it is.

530
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,600
I think you're just going to set yourself up for disappointment.

531
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,720
So just kind of want to throw that out there.

532
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:11,040
Uh, Nietzsche in our chat room says, is the original Silent Hill still playable or is

533
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,760
it painful to play through?

534
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,760
Got a free copy through PlayStation Plus.

535
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,160
Yeah, don't forget it is, is free on PlayStation Plus.

536
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,560
I need to grab it myself.

537
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:21,360
Um, that is a direct port of the PlayStation one game.

538
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,340
So as I understand, everything should be fine.

539
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:29,400
It's not going to be up rezzed or any of that stuff besides the very, very, very basic like

540
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:33,520
texture smoothing and some of the things that the PlayStation three will do to PS one classics.

541
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,520
Um, otherwise you're getting a pretty legitimate experience as long as you're willing to play

542
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:42,260
a game with 1997 graphics, then you'll be all right.

543
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,360
You know, just keep that in mind.

544
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,160
It was the games getting to be almost 15 years old.

545
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,640
So all right, um, that's it with our gaming weeks.

546
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,680
Let's move on into some housekeeping.

547
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,560
Of course you can still find us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R we are on Facebook

548

Facebook.com slash orange lounge.

550
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,640
I do want to throw out there though, please follow our new network, the VOG networks.

551
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,680
You can stay tuned to all the changes that are going on.

552
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:10,680
Twitter.com slash VOG network is where you can follow the new network and it's also on

553
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,280
Facebook, facebook.com slash VOG network.

554
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,440
Orange lounge radio is also on Google plus search for us there.

555
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,200
VOG's not there yet, but it will be.

556
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,680
Um, and um, I think that's, I think that's it for all the plugs.

557
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,640
Please help spread the word about the new network.

558
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,720
We so can't wait.

559
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:32,520
And I again really want to thank the folks at geek-life.com for all the work they did

560
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,520
in promoting today's launch.

561
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,300
Go visit their website and click on ads.

562
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,480
It would go a long way.

563
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,480
Thank you much.

564
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,520
All right, let's move on.

565
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,520
Let's um, get into some gaming news this week.

566
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,520
Loki start off.

567
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:52,680
So Sony is not one to be outdone by Nintendo in the form of, you know, uh, mascot character

568
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,720
battle royale deathmatch or whatever.

569
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,720
Um, so now they have the PlayStation all stars battle royale, which is coming to the PlayStation

570
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,720
three.

571
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,880
Uh, this year, I wish it was coming together.

572
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,080
That'd be kind of cool.

573
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:09,240
But um, it's being developed by super bot and it features characters from all sorts

574
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:14,960
of different places and franchises, new and old, including, um, Parappa the rapper was

575
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,960
in there.

576
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,960
That was kind of cool.

577
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,260
Um, Kratos, he did study Kung Fu punch.

578
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,120
It's all in the mind and they actually took that into account.

579
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,440
So he does have some Kung Fu moves that he uses.

580
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:31,160
So well, he damn well better actually Parappa's lethal move is he gives you the most bitch

581
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,440
and paper cut you've ever had in your life.

582
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,440
That's what he does.

583
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:42,760
Uh, but of course, you know, the Sly Cooper is in there, um, fat princess, um, and also,

584
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:47,800
you know, some other characters that are mentioning that, you know, obviously Cole from Infamous

585
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,060
is probably going to be in there and they're going to have some characters from resistance

586
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,560
and all sorts of different things.

587
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:59,200
Um, and it looks extremely like, you know, I'm trying to think of other big Sony products

588
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,360
so they could bring in this game, obviously, uh, absolute, uh, the cart, little cart dudes

589
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,560
from ModNation racers.

590
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,560
Um, maybe.

591
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,560
I don't know.

592
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,760
I don't think about the cast of the tester.

593
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,520
Should we call Oscar to see if they did any sweet tooth was going to be in there.

594
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,320
Um, now one of the things I did like about, um, the game that they kind of showed in the

595
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,200
trailers since this whole thing is kind of like this matte mashup thing they have like

596
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,640
in the background, kind of like two different worlds clashing at the same time.

597
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:30,280
So like for example, they'll have, um, uh, it was actually really cool.

598
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,760
They had, I think one of the demons.

599
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:38,440
I want Hades from, um, God of war was actually attacking, um, the Pat upon.

600
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,520
So that was kind of cool.

601
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,020
They had that kind of going on there.

602
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:47,240
There was one I saw, it was little big planets world kind of, um, crossed with, uh, what

603
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:52,640
the fuck is their dam, uh, buzz, the, the buzz game, like the quiz show thing.

604
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,640
Oh yeah.

605
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,640
Buzz.

606
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,640
Yeah.

607
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,640
So a host dude.

608
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,640
Yeah.

609
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,480
So I'm wondering if he's a character or something, but, uh, it was interesting, but the gameplay

610
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,400
itself looks exactly like smash brothers.

611
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,400
Exactly like smash brothers.

612
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:08,560
Have the, have the creators addressed that gigantic pink elephant in the room that, Hey,

613
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,600
your game looks really damn familiar.

614
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,360
I think I've seen this somewhere before.

615
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,360
No.

616
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:19,960
Um, it doesn't seem like they have, I mean, it's going to play a little bit different,

617
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,800
but damn, does it look like smash brothers?

618
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,320
Well, here, here's the question.

619
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:29,440
I mean, is it okay what they're doing because you know, I kind of go, well, they're, they're

620
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,120
there's several different basketball games that come out and there's all these dance

621
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,120
games.

622
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,120
It's just like fighting games.

623
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,400
I mean, all the fighting games, I mean, are pretty similar, right?

624
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:44,440
So there's, I think enough different with it that it'll be, you know, its own thing,

625
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,200
but I don't know.

626
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,080
It's just, it, it obviously it's getting one of the things that people are gonna think

627
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,960
of him as like, wow, this really looks like smashers.

628
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,280
No, that could be good or bad.

629
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,280
I don't know.

630
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:58,720
So did people, you know, call out smash brothers for being like, you know, for having the four

631
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,200
player thing like power stone.

632
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,840
I mean, even the power stone was, you know, full layout.

633
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:10,640
It was, you know, and not the, the semi 2d, um, zither in the chat room says Nintendo

634
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,480
should Sue, but Ross TLUT in our chat room at vognetwork.com follows that up with well,

635
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:22,020
but hold on because you know, um, smash brothers wasn't really the first game to do it either.

636
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:27,800
And links to a game called the out foxies, which I don't remember this game at all, but

637
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:31,720
certainly, you know, certainly there's probably older games in the past that were similar.

638
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,960
I remember playing one on the DS that was very similar.

639
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,960
I guess that would be after smash brothers in the 64 that was a, the top Trump's or not

640
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,960
top Trump's.

641
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:45,580
It's a, the, it was all the, um, it was like, yeah, it was like, uh, yeah, like snake from

642
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:49,480
metal gear was in it and all this, I played it at a comic convention once there was a

643
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,480
game on the DS.

644
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,580
It was total like, just like it and it, it existed and I'm looking at, it was a shonen

645
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,580
jump game.

646
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,580
That's what it was.

647
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,840
It was something really boring.

648
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,400
Uh, no Trump's is a card game.

649
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,560
I understand that, but it was shown in jump.

650
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:07,720
Uh, it was their game that they had, uh, Bob coffee in our term says smash for N 64 came

651
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,080
out before power stone.

652
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,640
If I recall, that is true.

653
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,640
That is true.

654
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:16,120
Jump and power, power stone actually was full on 3d rotational, everything.

655
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,640
Uh, several folks in our chat room, all jumping in there, jump all stars is the game I'm trying

656
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,640
to think of.

657
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,640
Yeah.

658
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,640
So you know, this type of thing.

659
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,800
And there was the Ninja turtles game on game cube.

660
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:30,160
There's been some other kind of inspired, heavily inspired, shall we say by smash brothers?

661
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:36,640
I got to say as much as I kind of chuckle at this game being, you know, heavily inspired,

662
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,280
shall we say about what Nintendo's got going on?

663
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,660
I want to play it.

664
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,240
It looks pretty cool.

665
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:48,080
I love the fact that it'll be HD and it's going to get online, right?

666
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,080
That's one place.

667
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:54,360
I mean, I guess smash brothers, you know, melee did as well as it could with the online,

668
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:57,800
but I'm, I'm thinking that this has got to be coming out for the, uh, the Vita.

669
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:03,040
I mean, it would be, I would think it would be a mistake not to put it on the Vita, especially

670
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:07,680
it's, it's something, although, although, um, maybe the reason it's not coming on the

671
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:11,280
Vita is because they really have issues with doing network play.

672
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,640
You know, it's like, well, well you can do it via wifi or you can do this asynchronous

673
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,000
multiplayer bullshit.

674
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Doesn't street fighter cross Tekken, isn't that going to be PS3 and Vita?

675
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,240
Like you can, well, it is going to be, yeah, but I mean, you know, Capcom's had more experience

676
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,240
working on the PlayStation three.

677
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:32,520
That's why they couldn't, you know, add certain features to the Xbox version.

678
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,760
Shadow next gen in our chat says, sky, this is a PS3 game.

679
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,920
There's no guarantee that online will be done right.

680
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:43,400
That may be true, but I'm sorry I give Sony more credit than I give Nintendo when it comes

681
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,400
to doing online, right?

682
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,960
Yeah, I would trust them with online better than granted.

683
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,960
Smash Brothers Melee probably did a hell of a lot better than any other Nintendo game

684
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,600
before it, as far as online goes, but keep in mind, Nintendo had that whole friend code

685
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,600
garbage you had to work with, you know, so that didn't make anything fun.

686
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,940
So, um, all right.

687
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:06,960
So anyhow, again, if you want to join our chat room, vog network.com, meanwhile, let's

688
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,400
go to some other gaming news.

689
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:14,600
Uh, this is a little bit of a surprise or, and it's not because it's always about patents.

690
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:19,200
You know, patent, I get the sense that patent laws in this country are, are going to be

691
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,520
headed somewhere different soon, especially you hear, there's just so much in the news

692
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,520
about like what?

693
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,240
Twitter was a Twitter.

694
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,900
So one of them acquired all these patents and said that they're only using them defensively.

695
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,960
They don't plan to use ever like sue for patent or whatever.

696
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:38,920
And then you have Facebook suing Yahoo and Yahoo suing Facebook and all this stuff over

697
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,920
patents.

698
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,400
I mean the, the money that's getting sucked away into all this is just amazing.

699
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,320
And here we have another result of the whole patent warfare.

700
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:54,680
The Xbox 360 has been found infringing on four patents that were owned by Motorola.

701
00:35:54,680 --> 00:36:00,520
Uh, according to the website, the verge, the patents that were in question deal with the

702
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:06,960
video codec, the H two 64, um, that is also going on with some other legal proceedings

703
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,280
with Microsoft and Motorola right now.

704
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,060
The other two are about wifi technology.

705
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:16,960
There's also a fifth patent about communication between the Xbox and its accessories.

706
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:22,200
However, one of the wifi patents was found not infringed and one claim regarding one

707
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:27,960
of the video patents was invalid, but some were found to be valid.

708
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:34,560
So Microsoft is seeking to force a Motorola to license its standard patents under more

709
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:40,400
fair and reasonable terms, but this original ruling by the judge is a bit of a blow on

710
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,040
Microsoft's efforts.

711
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:47,160
However, as most things in the legal system appeal, appeal, appeal, and the appeal step

712
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,160
is a panel of six judges.

713
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,600
I want to say that they're also suing, I want to say that they're suing Apple too.

714
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:57,560
It, um, it was some other big company, um, that Motorola was going after.

715
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:04,680
I want to say, I think it was Apple when Zethur and Motorola used to make Apple's processors.

716
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,280
All the tech companies have helped each other and then stab each other in the back.

717
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,280
It's it's, it's crazy.

718
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,120
Zethur in her terms is patent trolling.

719
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:16,240
Basically I reserve the term patent troll for a company that exists to do nothing but

720
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,240
this.

721
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:23,440
Um, and, but you're talking Motorola and Microsoft, you know, they're both really big companies.

722
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,880
Motorola makes lots of phones.

723
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,360
I don't know if I call them a patent troll.

724
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,340
This is just patent warfare.

725
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:34,800
This is very similar to what you see going on with Yahoo and Facebook.

726
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,000
You know, Yahoo hasn't been doing so well lately because you know, back in the early

727
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,920
days of the web, Yahoo was kind of like the king of search engines.

728
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,240
It was a big directory everybody used and uh, you know, they, they, they've survived.

729
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,240
They kept up with water.

730
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:49,680
And it is Apple by the way, they've tried to become a bit of a portal.

731
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,160
They have their Yahoo mail, but they haven't really been able to like break through like,

732
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,440
you know, Google kind of stomped on it and so forth.

733
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,080
I still use Yahoo here and there.

734
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:02,480
They're a good portal, but they're struggling and they've had to lay a lot of people off.

735
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,680
So what did Yahoo do?

736
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,760
They sued Facebook over 10 patents that Yahoo had and a lot of it tied into, I think the

737
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:13,560
my Yahoo that they tried to develop that has a lot of aggregate feed type stuff that Facebook

738
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,880
also does to kind of put it in a nutshell.

739
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,360
Um, so what did Facebook do in return?

740
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,040
Sued Yahoo right back over other patents.

741
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,820
That's just patent warfare.

742
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:26,760
And that is, I don't want to say it's patent trolling, but it's clear that Yahoo struggling

743
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:31,920
and this is something that they're doing to try and kind of get themselves back up a little

744
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,920
bit.

745
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,760
Or maybe just try to stay relevant.

746
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,760
In a way maybe.

747
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:42,960
Well, um, I found the, the other one and actually it is Apple, um, that's for a patent for noise

748
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,200
elimination and other interference during voice and data transmission.

749
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,480
So now does this mean the Xbox 360 is going to suddenly stop being sold?

750
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,960
I kind of doubt that.

751
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:58,360
Um, it's gone a little far this at this point, but could Microsoft end up having to pay huge

752
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,120
amounts of money to Motorola?

753
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:04,120
Could they have to, you know, agree to some pretty hefty terms for the technology?

754
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,840
Yeah, it's possible.

755
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:10,400
Could they perhaps not put rumble in their next console because it's not really that

756
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,400
important anyways.

757
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,560
It has nothing to do with the fact that they infringed on the patent.

758
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,560
Oh, remember all that?

759
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,680
Yeah, that's a great comparison.

760
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,680
Remember that?

761
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,680
That's why you didn't have rumble in the original PlayStation 3.

762
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,840
No, it wasn't because they were infringing on patents.

763
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,880
It's because it wasn't important until they decided to put it in there.

764
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,880
Sure, sure.

765
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,880
Whatever.

766
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,880
That's exactly what it is.

767
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,960
Not the fact that they got sued over the PlayStation 2 controllers.

768
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,360
No, it was just, it wasn't important right then.

769
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,680
It just, it became important later.

770
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,560
Sixaxis was the future of gaming.

771
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:39,840
What was the last game that used Sixaxis?

772
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,640
Sixaxis was a pain in the ass.

773
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:46,560
I know the last thing that I played that included it was Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

774
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,560
I think that was it.

775
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,560
That game's a few years old.

776
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,240
I think there's still some games that use it, but man, it's not something that they're

777
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,240
like, hey!

778
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,640
Little Big Planet is one of the last ones I can think of that uses it.

779
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,080
Um, yeah.

780
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,080
Sixaxis.

781
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:03,240
You can use it as a steering wheel, right?

782
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,480
Yeah, it works, works great too.

783
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,480
Awesome.

784
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,200
Actually, that's why I still have a negcon.

785
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,120
I will say, actually, I thought of it.

786
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:15,800
I will, there is a Sixaxis game that was pretty bitchin', Flower.

787
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,160
That's like the only Sixaxis game I can sit here and say I truly enjoyed it.

788
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:24,480
I can use it to slightly adjust the camera in Journey.

789
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,640
Moving on with more news.

790
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:31,160
How about something that doesn't have to do with a really crappy controller?

791
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,160
How about it?

792
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,080
I got some Call of Duty.

793
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,080
How about it?

794
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,080
Bang, bang, bang.

795
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:41,880
Well, um, the release date for Call of Duty Black Ops 2 has been leaked.

796
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:44,440
Which I don't know if it was on purpose or not.

797
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:48,920
I love when they say leaked, but you don't really know.

798
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,920
Anyway.

799
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:57,100
Um, so there was an image of the PS3 and Xbox 360 pre-order cards for Target.

800
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,600
And it was posted by IGN earlier.

801
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,680
It says it's gonna be on November 13th.

802
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,560
So we have a shake of the head.

803
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,560
Loki?

804
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,560
I think they're guessing.

805
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,320
Nothing's been announced.

806
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,020
They're seriously guessing because I don't even think the game's gonna be called Black

807
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,720
Ops 2 to be honest.

808
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:20,680
Um, because they've registered trademarks for Call of Duty Eclipse.

809
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:25,560
And they're guessing because already in blogs, like Kotaku and some other places, they've

810
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:30,600
speculated that it's gonna be on the 13th because there happens to be a full lunar eclipse

811
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,720
or solar eclipse actually on that date.

812
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:37,160
Which also happens to fall on a Tuesday during November.

813
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:41,920
There's a fucking election, presidential election happening the same day as the Halo release

814
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,920
date.

815
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,920
Well, to continue.

816
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,920
Solar eclipses don't matter.

817
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:49,640
There was indication first of a Black Ops sequel with an Amazon France listing that

818
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,640
got pulled.

819
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:55,680
Um, but there's supposed to be actual news coming out on this on May 1st.

820
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:00,560
And the other reason I call bullshit on this too is because they, Call of Duty, they're

821
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:08,780
using like, was it, like the Roman numerals for Black Ops 2 when, you know, it's most

822
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:14,440
likely they normally just use like actual, you know, numbers for their titles.

823
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:16,000
I just don't think it's gonna be Black Ops.

824
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,800
I think that they're just guessing.

825
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:24,200
And what's it really gonna hurt if they have, you know, um, some sort of, you know, pre-order

826
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,040
card or whatever to get people excited about a new Call of Duty game?

827
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:31,080
I mean, so what, if it ends up being something else, they'll just have to reprint cards.

828
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:34,100
But I mean, we're gonna find out soon enough.

829
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:35,100
It's just not.

830
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:39,160
If they've got a card dated with it though, and this is just, if you think about the cost

831
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:43,200
of printing and on a national scale.

832
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,200
But I mean, this isn't.

833
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,200
Wait, wait a minute.

834
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,200
Wait a minute.

835
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,800
If a target would just put a release date in their system and then put these fake things

836
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,080
on the shelves to entice people to pre-order.

837
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:56,560
I've never heard of that done before in the gaming retail industry.

838
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:01,040
And it's not like that big major changes have not been wrong, you know, in printed marking

839
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,040
material.

840
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,040
Like for example.

841
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,040
It doesn't really matter.

842
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:08,120
According to Best Buy, you know, shit Diablo 3 should have been out months ago.

843
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,120
I mean.

844
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,120
Wait a minute.

845
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,240
That was one Best Buy in like Wisconsin or something.

846
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,240
And the whole thing, it doesn't really matter because they're making announcement on it

847
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,080
in three days.

848
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,280
So again, does it matter?

849
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,280
No.

850
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,280
It's, but it's all about firsties.

851
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,520
It's all about who did it first, who called it first.

852
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,960
And because, you know, that's why we have the whole patent wars.

853
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,040
And that's a pile of who gives a shit.

854
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,040
Yeah.

855
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:38,400
That's so that all these websites can go exclusive, exclusive release date, at least exclusive

856
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,400
pictures of the exclusive, exclusiving exclusive that we have.

857
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,880
You know what an actual exclusive is?

858
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:52,020
Is if the company went to, Hey, Hey, IGN, we want you to have the date officially from

859
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,400
us.

860
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,840
That's an exclusive.

861
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:58,400
Getting it off of a, you know, a card from a target.

862
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,840
You mean like certain radio entrepreneurs may have gone to a geeky website to give them

863
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,360
the exclusive on what was happening?

864
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,360
Exactly.

865
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:08,320
When they come to you and say, we want you to do it first because you've been good

866
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,440
to us.

867
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:16,280
But if I use the word exclusive as much as exclusively possible in my article, then I'll

868
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:26,040
get more hits and I'll get to go to E3 because that's what this industry has turned into.

869
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:31,480
Exclusive Jamie Shuttermouth for the first time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

870
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,200
That's a Rob Roberts exclusive.

871
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,240
Actions speak louder than words and none of you can see this action.

872
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,520
And I'm getting the finger.

873
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,480
I mean, yeah, it's a good guess.

874
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:44,840
I mean, obviously they're not going to launch the same day as Halo and it's typically the

875
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:51,440
second second Tuesday of November that they normally launch Call of Duty.

876
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:56,800
So I mean, it's a good guess and they could be right.

877
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:58,560
I was not purring.

878
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:03,200
I mean, it's only like what, you know, one in four shot of being correct.

879
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:08,360
So yeah, and actually one in two because I mean it's going to be in the beginning of

880
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:09,360
the month.

881
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:13,160
They might have to recall all those cards or in the great retail big box way.

882
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,160
Get a bunch.

883
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,320
Get a big black marker.

884
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,320
Get the new guy.

885
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,320
Hey, new guy.

886
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:23,200
Take this giant stack of 500 cards and you take this Sharpie and everywhere you see a

887
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:27,200
13 you're going to write a 20.

888
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,200
You think you can do that?

889
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,940
When do I get my break?

890
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,720
That's not how it works.

891
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:37,080
You didn't have to pay that guy more to be honest for the time that would take him to

892
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,080
do all that.

893
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:41,640
Then it would just be to print up 50,000 new cards.

894
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,800
Can I, can I go on a tangent?

895
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,800
I want a vog tangent.

896
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,920
I want our first vog tangent.

897
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,440
We already had one of those, Rob.

898
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:51,440
I went grocery.

899
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,440
It was okra.

900
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,640
I went grocery shopping with Alan yesterday.

901
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,400
We went to the grocery store.

902
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,780
I know, right?

903
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:58,960
I know, right?

904
00:45:58,960 --> 00:45:59,960
So we went to the grocery store.

905
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:00,960
Exclusive.

906
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:10,280
And we bought probably like, I don't know, $120 worth of groceries, but thanks to couponing

907
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:12,960
I got it down to 115.

908
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:13,960
But anyway.

909
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:14,960
How very Dutch of you.

910
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:20,360
The point is, well it is in my heritage, but anyway, we get the cart, you know how you

911
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,080
take the cart up to the little thing and you put everything up on the conveyor belt, right?

912
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:29,900
One of the employees was standing there waiting for us to put the cart and they actually took

913
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,600
everything out of the cart and put it on the conveyor belt.

914
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,240
And I was thinking, they don't ever do that for you.

915
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:39,580
You always, why are the employees, they have one person bagging, they have one at the register,

916
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:43,120
and now this chick is just loading the groceries on the conveyor belt for me.

917
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:47,340
I mean, not that I'm going to complain, but it does kind of make me go, gosh, I feel really

918
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:48,340
fucking lazy.

919
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:51,880
And I'm like, is everybody else in the grocery store just watching this poor grocery clerk

920
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:52,880
like do this for me?

921
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:57,000
And like, if I was in a wheelchair or had a cast on or something, I could understand

922
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,000
why they do that.

923
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:06,000
But Alan and I are both perfectly healthy individuals, you know, Rob and Alan are healthy.

924
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Yet she was doing it.

925
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,160
So I was like, um, well, thank you for loading the groceries on the conveyor belt.

926
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,400
What so whatever do we owe this?

927
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,520
Like I don't usually see us.

928
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:18,480
And she said, well, we're really overstaffed right now.

929
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,040
We have a lot of new people that just started today.

930
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,480
So we have so many people.

931
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,280
She's like, I was just, I was just here.

932
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:26,440
I needed something to do.

933
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:30,440
And she's like, I spent all morning in the produce department just arranging things.

934
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:35,840
And I'm thinking to myself inappropriately, I'm thinking to myself, apples and bananas.

935
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:39,920
As much as I appreciate that she has a job, she has good employment.

936
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,600
So that offers union.

937
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,280
See if she wants to go home.

938
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:45,280
She's union.

939
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,280
What is that?

940
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,440
Is that a union thing?

941
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,360
I didn't even think of that, but you're probably right.

942
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,360
I worked.

943
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:53,720
Keep in mind, I worked for a grocery store for all of three freaking days and I quit

944
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:57,720
after the old man tried to be a bitch to me and I told him he couldn't buy his beer.

945
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:03,560
I haven't said that story on the air, have I, but I know that like you had, you were,

946
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:07,180
you got guaranteed certain number of hours and you got guaranteed this.

947
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:13,040
And like you, if you were scheduled to work, you had to work and this crap, um, a sitting

948
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,240
vampire in chat says that's like someone pumping your gas.

949
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,240
It did.

950
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:18,240
It did.

951
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,240
Oregon.

952
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,240
It did feel very Jersey or Oregon.

953
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:21,240
Take your pick.

954
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:25,400
Um, I have to tell you one thing, and this just goes from my childhood and visiting my

955
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:31,680
granny in Dothan, Alabama, that we would go to the Piggly Wiggly.

956
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,960
I know the best name for a grocery store ever.

957
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,000
And I'm going to go get pork at the Piggly Wiggly.

958
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:44,640
And they had, um, these type of conveyor belts that your, um, the back end of your, uh, buggy

959
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:50,080
would unlatch and it would push right up to the belt and then the cashier would unload

960
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,080
for you.

961
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,080
They used to have those here too.

962
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:56,160
They were those kind of tall, flat, flatter type of buggies.

963
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,240
Some of the old railies here still had that where you just push, you don't even have a

964
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,240
conveyor belt.

965
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,880
You push the cart right up to the counter and then they open the front of it and just

966
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,600
pull everything off of it and go over the standard.

967
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,600
Which I think is great.

968
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,600
Yeah, I do too.

969
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:13,160
I mean, but now it's, you know, I also hate self service.

970
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:18,520
Uh, and then, well yeah, I was going to say, uh, Ross Deal UT in our VOG chat room says

971
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,160
here in Florida, we got Winn Dixie's with the self checkout counters.

972
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:22,160
Yeah, we have that too.

973
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:27,320
But when you're buying like $120 worth of groceries, I don't want to use the self.

974
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,960
Those things are a pain in the ass.

975
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,280
Old school Winn Dixie's by the way, had the old style thing too.

976
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:35,560
The self checkouts are great for like when, you know, you need just a pint of ice cream

977
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:41,900
and Doritos, but like when you're buying legit groceries for the week with produce and everything,

978
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:45,680
like you don't, I know I would not use the self checkout, it would take forever.

979
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,480
I have an expert do it.

980
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,480
Anyhow.

981
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:49,480
Wow.

982
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,480
Everyone's talking about what their grocery stores are.

983
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:53,480
I know.

984
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,440
So this is, this is the most the chat was talked about all night.

985
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,320
Perhaps we should become a grocery store podcast.

986
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:02,480
Uh, Nietzsche in our chat says here in Kansas, your groceries are always bagged and sometimes

987
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,520
carried to your vehicle.

988
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,520
No questions asked.

989
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,960
Raley's here does that.

990
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:09,240
Well, they always ask, but I'm always like, no, no, no, no, but the thing is they're required

991
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,240
to do it.

992
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,240
It's part of their job.

993
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:12,240
Really?

994
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,240
Yeah, it is.

995
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,240
So Dan and I have them do it.

996
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,800
Again, if I'm buying ice cream and Doritos, I don't want to help out.

997
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,760
If you're buying two things, that's one thing.

998
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,560
But like if you're, if you're getting like all your groceries for the week or for the

999
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:24,520
month or whatever, then it's, you know, it's kind of nice.

1000
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,520
It's part of their job.

1001
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,280
It's what they're supposed to do.

1002
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:32,320
And it, you know, honestly, we asked one of them flat out is like, do you really mind

1003
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,320
doing this?

1004
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,080
I like, I like getting out and getting some air.

1005
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,880
Hey, I want all those grapes individually bagged.

1006
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:42,960
I need you to go through this bag of M&Ms and pick out the green ones.

1007
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:47,920
Now, um, DJ Morpheus in chat is saying that's the Rob Roberts diet, ice cream and Doritos.

1008
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,240
I think that's your family crest.

1009
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:54,280
It's a big bag of Doritos with big, might well be pulps of ice cream coming out of the

1010
00:50:54,280 --> 00:51:03,760
top of it and like, um, hello kitty over the bag of Doritos and, uh, the, uh, word, a penis

1011
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,760
or something.

1012
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,400
I don't know.

1013
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:14,280
Well, so, uh, in great, uh, internet fashion, we have apparently dropped this for the podcast

1014
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,280
listeners.

1015
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,520
We're trying to reconnect to the feed right now.

1016
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,640
I hope this isn't a repeat of what happened last week.

1017
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,880
That would be most unfortunate, but I don't think Comcast does anything.

1018
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,000
It is trying to reconnect right now and there it is.

1019
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
It reconnected.

1020
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,760
Apparently I just watched the bandwidth guys.

1021
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,440
If you have anything else going on, I just have to get that out there.

1022
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:33,080
I know, but these things happen.

1023
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,360
So yeah, I agree with game guru.

1024
00:51:35,360 --> 00:51:37,400
If I get so popular, everyone is crashing.

1025
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,640
We'll just go with that.

1026
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,640
You guys are just crashing.

1027
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:40,640
Grocery lounge radio.

1028
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:41,640
All right.

1029
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:42,640
Anyhow.

1030
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:43,640
Yeah.

1031
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:44,640
You are the general manager.

1032
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:45,640
All right.

1033
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:46,640
Can we move on with more news?

1034
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,640
I don't know how I got on that tangent.

1035
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,120
I don't even know what that had to do with anything.

1036
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:52,560
Oh, because you were talking about the guy with the pen who would get paid too much to

1037
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,560
do that.

1038
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:54,960
And I'm like, they pay people to do crazy stuff.

1039
00:51:54,960 --> 00:52:01,400
Like the chick who put my stuff on the conveyor belt, like I like mass effect.

1040
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:03,600
It's a good game.

1041
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:07,800
I have to, I have to do a trolling dedicated to dark Tetsuya.

1042
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:08,800
If I may.

1043
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:09,800
Yeah.

1044
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:19,000
I do not torrent porn or torrent anything so goddamn slow.

1045
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,240
Why would I turn anything when there's no, I'm going to torrent that breadstick and go

1046
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,240
right ahead.

1047
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,120
You're going to torrent me half of it.

1048
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:29,000
And I don't torrent hentai or porn, at least not here.

1049
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
I mean, shit.

1050
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,200
This connection is too damn slow for that.

1051
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,640
Um, anyways, uh, so let's talk a little bit about Woodstock.

1052
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:42,240
No, I'm not talking about the, the gathering of musicians and sweaty people.

1053
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:48,880
I'm talking about Microsoft's brand new music service for the Xbox 360.

1054
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,840
Whoopty shit.

1055
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:55,400
Um, I guess because Zune maybe is not taking off too well.

1056
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:00,200
But um, I, oh, it's actually a relaunch and rebranding of the Zune music service.

1057
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,280
Oh, well then I'm really not interested now.

1058
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,920
Um, but anyways, they're dubbing it Woodstock.

1059
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:08,960
It's supposed to be coming out on multiple platforms, including, you know, the Xbox 360,

1060
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,480
Windows 8, iOS and Android devices.

1061
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:15,960
Um, they're also saying that of course it's going to launch, um, it's not going to launch

1062
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,080
till the fall with, you know, the Windows 8 launch.

1063
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:24,440
Um, but it's going to be similar to like Spotify and they're going to have some sort of Facebook

1064
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:28,720
integration as well where you can share your playlists and that kind of stuff.

1065
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,760
And you can buy bottled water for $7.

1066
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:33,760
Come on.

1067
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:34,760
There's a, it's a Starbucks.

1068
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,640
There's a Woodstock 94 joke in there.

1069
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,640
Come on people.

1070
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,640
Oh Rob.

1071
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:43,120
The thing about Woodstock, it's kind of funny that they're taking that name because everything

1072
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:46,200
like recent Woodstock hasn't been that great.

1073
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:51,020
Like there was some really bad things that happened at those Woodstock revival festivals

1074
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:52,240
or whatever in the nineties.

1075
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,480
Like I'm talking things happening in those mosh pits and stuff that really should not

1076
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:58,360
be happening anywhere period ever.

1077
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:02,060
And you know how much all of the people at the original Woodstock got paid like oodles

1078
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:04,640
and oodles and oodles to freaking be there.

1079
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:08,840
And they like underestimated the number of people that would come and there was no toiletries

1080
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,400
and people died and babies were born.

1081
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,280
But I, the Woodstock I was thinking of was a cute little yellow bird that hangs out with

1082
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,280
Snoopy.

1083
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:21,200
I just, all right, so they're going to have a music service.

1084
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,360
I hope it's free because otherwise I'm not going to be interested in it.

1085
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,800
Let's talk about this other half of it then.

1086
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:32,560
But why is Microsoft relaunching this again when they've really tried that zoom thing

1087
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:38,120
and it just like, you know, because now they're trying to be the entertainment hub.

1088
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:43,840
They want the Xbox 360 or even whatever the next console is to be this entertainment hub.

1089
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:47,760
They're trying to get away from just being a games console they want.

1090
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,600
It's a kind of replace like your set top box.

1091
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:54,480
You put it in, you know, your living room with your TV and you're watching movies on

1092
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,480
there.

1093
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:56,480
You're playing games on there.

1094
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,320
Everybody's in front of it with connect your, you know, listening to music.

1095
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,480
They want it to be integrated with your life basically.

1096
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,520
Um, and that's what they're trying to do with this.

1097
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,520
They're adding music to it.

1098
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:08,240
I agree with infinite in the chat room.

1099
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,360
Wayne stock was much safer.

1100
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:11,360
That's true.

1101
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:15,280
If they call this Wayne stock, I would, uh, I would be kidding and give my right arm.

1102
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,680
Yes, no right eye.

1103
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,320
That was it.

1104
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:25,120
All right, let's move on with some more news.

1105
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:27,000
And this one has to do with Skyrim.

1106
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,360
Hey, and it has nothing to do with arrows and body parts.

1107
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,360
I swear.

1108
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:36,440
This has to do with a Skyrim expansion pack, maybe question mark.

1109
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:40,840
Apparently in the latest Skyrim patch, there are several references to what's called snow

1110
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:45,520
elves, including a snow elf Prince who has some dialogue.

1111
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:50,960
Uh, there's also files talking about crossbows, a whole folder called DLC01.

1112
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,320
Hmm.

1113
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:53,720
What could that be about?

1114
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:57,840
So apparently this is information about the first DLC pack for Skyrim.

1115
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,360
We don't know a whole lot else about it.

1116
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:02,680
Although there's certainly that part of me that says, I'm going to buy it.

1117
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:06,360
Well that, and gee, this, this took a little while for this to come out.

1118
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,200
You too can take an X to the elbow.

1119
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:11,560
Good things come to those who wait, usually.

1120
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:17,840
I have more faith in Bethesda and DLC versus any other company on the face of the earth.

1121
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:24,520
Um, just because it seems like their content is very, you know, thoroughly rich and full

1122
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:30,360
of, you know, actual new things and not stuff that was on the disc.

1123
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,160
Plus crossbows are pretty awesome.

1124
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,160
Crossbows are pretty awesome.

1125
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,520
Autocrossbows are even better.

1126
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,400
One of these days I'll stop playing Mass Effect long enough to go back and play these other

1127
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,080
games I've missed like Skyrim and stuff.

1128
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:41,800
But you know the problem with crossbows is...

1129
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:45,120
And run a certain somebody through a couple of dungeons on WoW.

1130
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,120
Maybe.

1131
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,600
Maybe reload.

1132
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:49,600
It's a Game of Thrones run.

1133
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,600
What if it's like an autocrossbow?

1134
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:55,280
Gee, that'd be awesome.

1135
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,200
So Final Fantasy 6-ish.

1136
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,720
Moving on, Dark Sakura.

1137
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,320
How about some Vita crap?

1138
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:07,960
Um, because it is actually kind of performing like crap.

1139
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,240
In Europe anyway.

1140
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:16,160
Um, the Vita is being outsold by both the Wii and the PSP in Europe.

1141
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:23,200
Um, they're basically saying, um, that, uh, and this is actually a quote from Iwata of

1142
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,200
Nintendo.

1143
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:27,600
Saying that based on sales information by market research companies in each European

1144
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:36,800
country, um, basically that the PS3 is the top with the 3DS and Xbox 360 in second.

1145
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:44,480
The Wii in fourth, PSP in fifth, the Vita in sixth, and the DS, um, I guess right after

1146
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,480
that.

1147
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:49,880
So yeah, um, the Vita is basically selling 25,000 units a week.

1148
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:54,540
Um, and there's still 70,000 PS3s being sold weekly.

1149
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:57,920
Well that's some good news for Sony, at least the PS3's on top over there.

1150
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,000
But Loki, any idea what this looks like in America?

1151
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Is this the same?

1152
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,800
Are they having the same issue here?

1153
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:08,080
I'm surprised that anyone's still selling a ton of PSPs, I know we don't sell any PSPs.

1154
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:12,240
Um, and by we I mean my customers, because no one's asking for them.

1155
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,360
And hell, there's nothing coming out for the PSP.

1156
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:22,080
I mean, last thing was MLB 12, or MLB, um, yeah MLB The Show 12, wait no, MLB 2K12.

1157
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:28,560
Um, but, and then there's a few Atlus RPGs, but that's all that really is coming.

1158
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:33,200
According to Iwata right now in the US, um, actually no this isn't just according to him,

1159
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:36,000
but there's other, there is a listing on here.

1160
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:42,600
At the top of it is Xbox 360, then PS3, then the 3DS, and the Vita right behind the 3DS

1161
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:46,320
and forth, then we have Wii, DS, and PSP.

1162
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:51,400
Why is Iwata talking about the Vita, oh I see, because he's trying to say the 3DS is

1163
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,400
so much better, blah blah blah.

1164
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:55,880
Well he's saying that right now the 3DS is dominating in Japan.

1165
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:56,880
I see.

1166
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:58,080
Well it's been out for a year!

1167
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,080
I mean, come on!

1168
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:01,800
I mean, why are we even comparing these two systems, you're talking about a system that

1169
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:04,800
launched two months ago versus a system that's been out like for a year.

1170
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:09,320
Well and the Vita is kinda in that point where the 3DS was at this point after its launch,

1171
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:13,120
where like, hooray, we had the launch with all the big launch games, now we're in a lull.

1172
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:17,120
Yeah, it's like, listen Iwata, you better fuckin' keep that good karma coming because

1173
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:21,160
if you start talking, you know, crap about this, you've got a system launching pretty

1174
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:23,360
soon and it could tank pretty easy.

1175
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:29,520
Well, really he's just been, you know, just speaking, more not, instead of you know, pooping

1176
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:34,480
on everybody else, he's just more been speaking about, oh the 3DS is doing very well, we're

1177
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,760
very confident in how the market's going.

1178
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:40,840
But to the Vita's credit, I mean, you know, it's not the, because they do have some big

1179
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:44,160
things here and there coming out, like the Mortal Kombat Vita is out pretty soon, that's

1180
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:45,720
gonna be a pretty big deal for them.

1181
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:49,600
They did release Skype on the Vita this week, which is pretty cool, you know, like their

1182
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:55,960
FaceTime-esque sorta app, and I actually checked that out on the Vita, it runs very nicely.

1183
00:59:55,960 --> 01:00:00,660
And you know, the Vita does, had a more robust launch lineup, but it is still, there's nothing

1184
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:05,520
to really get, I mean, Mortal Kombat, whether, you know, it is what it is, it's been out

1185
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,480
already, it is a port of a game that's already been out for a year.

1186
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:13,720
I would think come the holidays, E3 this year, we're gonna hear more about what the holidays

1187
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:16,520
have in store for the Vita, and that's when things are really gonna pick up for them again.

1188
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:20,400
To be fair, that's one more Mortal Kombat game than the 3DS has.

1189
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,400
True.

1190
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,880
No one's porting shit to the 3DS.

1191
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:28,920
True, unless you want to say, well, you can play DS games on the 3DS, and I think there

1192
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:33,080
was, I think Deadly Alliance, or one of them got a port to the DS, probably wasn't very

1193
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:34,600
good, but it's there.

1194
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:41,520
I mean, there's a Street Fighter IV game, you know, I don't know, it's just, yeah, I

1195
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:45,720
don't really think it's fair to compare them yet, it's still, you know, compare their one

1196
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:46,720
year numbers, okay?

1197
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:51,640
One year, compare the numbers of the 3DS versus the numbers of the Vita in a year, and see

1198
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:52,640
where they're at.

1199
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,560
I'm not surprised that they're behind the 3DS.

1200
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:57,640
A lot more people are picking up 3DSs, because I think they're cheaper now.

1201
01:00:57,640 --> 01:01:02,160
Shadownextgen in our chatroom at vognetwork.com says, a Vita price drop will be announced

1202
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:05,760
to E3 if Sony is smart, agree?

1203
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:12,000
They could, I know that the 3DS isn't dropping in price any time soon, so, I mean, they could,

1204
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,640
it would be smart, but, I hope I get some free games with it.

1205
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:21,000
I don't think a price drop will come, but I think they'll sweeten the pot of the existing

1206
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,200
pack.

1207
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:27,960
What I mean by that is, larger memory card, and probably more, like, throw-ins, like,

1208
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:33,360
comes with an 8 gig memory card that already has little big planet Vita, oops, that's another

1209
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:36,380
big game that's coming out at some point, right, no, that got pushed back, right?

1210
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:38,720
It's not coming out any time soon, they haven't announced the date for it yet.

1211
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,280
Alright, then fucking ModNation Racers Vita, I don't know, just...

1212
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:45,200
Well, they could have Resistance, there's Gravity, you know, Gravity Rush, there's...

1213
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:48,680
I would think they're gonna sweeten the pot of the existing pack, I don't think they're

1214
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:50,480
gonna lower the price necessarily.

1215
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:54,240
You know, I mean, they do like doing these different bundles, so, I could see them doing

1216
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,960
some special, like, holiday bundles and stuff like that.

1217
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,080
Baconbits in our chatroom, this will be the last comment on this story, then we'll move

1218
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:04,160
on, Baconbits in our chatroom says, I don't want the Vita to fail, but I feel like it's

1219
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,320
gonna happen.

1220
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:06,320
It's too early!

1221
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:10,480
Yeah, it's too, again, you gotta go back to where the 3DS was at this point, everybody

1222
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:15,960
said, 3DS is gonna fail, 3DS is gonna fail, and then, bam, price drop, bam, Mario, bam,

1223
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:20,440
you know, it's just, everything just hit it once, and then the system really recovered.

1224
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:26,760
You know, and the PlayStation 3, early on, was hideous!

1225
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:31,440
Too damn expensive and nothing on it, you know, but, PlayStations really come around,

1226
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:35,720
so, you know, I think it's too early to bury the Vita.

1227
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:40,240
Is the Vita flying off shelves in the must-have technology that Sony wanted it to be?

1228
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:44,640
Alright, maybe not, but, that doesn't mean it's a dead and dying system.

1229
01:02:44,640 --> 01:02:49,880
They tried, I think, I mean, they had a better lineup at launch than the 3DS had, that's

1230
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:54,680
for sure, and they have a lot more games coming out, and even the 3DS, I mean, there's games

1231
01:02:54,680 --> 01:03:00,280
coming out, but, I mean, for, I would think that, you know, like the hardcore gamer look,

1232
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:04,080
you know, using the 3DS, I think there's only a handful of games really coming out before

1233
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:07,840
the end of this year that they might be interested in, whereas I think there's gonna be a lot

1234
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:13,520
more of that for the, the, I'm sorry, the 3DS has a handful of games.

1235
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:17,120
The Vita, I think they've got, you know, quite a bit of potential games coming out for it,

1236
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:21,800
I mean, hell, you know, there's some big first party games still on their way in the next

1237
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:27,320
couple months, and, you know, Call of Duty's gonna help, I mean, fuck, a portable Call

1238
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:28,320
of Duty game?

1239
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:33,280
You know, not necessarily the PSP ones, because they're kinda, yeah, but, you know, one on

1240
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:36,980
the Vita that's, you know, you've got like Black Ops 2 or whatever they're gonna call

1241
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:40,360
it on the Vita, that could be pretty big.

1242
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:43,960
Slidekick in our chatroom says, girl, PS3 is still hideous, Rob.

1243
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:44,960
I disagree.

1244
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:45,960
I really disagree.

1245
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:51,720
It's, Little Big Planet is my, that's, there is nothing like it on Nintendo, there's nothing

1246
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:57,360
like it on Microsoft, and it is an incredible video game, and it's, it's Sony's franchise,

1247
01:03:57,360 --> 01:04:00,020
you know, and that's just, you know, that's just the one that comes up to the mind is

1248
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:01,440
most important for me.

1249
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:06,840
I still say Sony, despite all our jokes earlier about Sixaxis, I think now Sony has the better

1250
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:07,840
controller.

1251
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:11,280
I prefer to play games with the Sony controller than I do the 360.

1252
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,920
Sony does have the free online, for whatever it's worth.

1253
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:19,280
You know, I don't mean to sound like a fanboy, there's reasons why I like 360 as well, but,

1254
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,960
you know, I don't think it's all doom and gloom with the PlayStation 3.

1255
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:25,600
I think, I think consumers have a real choice to make.

1256
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:30,480
And when somebody asks me, Rob, what should I get, a PlayStation 3 or a Xbox 360?

1257
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:34,640
It's a, I have to go back to the golden rule of gaming, a system is only as good as the

1258
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:35,640
games that are on it.

1259
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:36,640
What do you wanna play?

1260
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:37,640
You wanna play Mario?

1261
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:38,640
Or you wanna play LittleBigPlanet?

1262
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:39,640
You wanna play Fable?

1263
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:41,600
Or you wanna play God of War?

1264
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:45,080
You know, it's really about those issues.

1265
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:49,760
All right, anyhow, let's move on with some release dates.

1266
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:53,400
We're gonna travel around the world and check out what's coming out soon in a store near

1267
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:54,400
you.

1268
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,200
There's not a lot this week, it's pretty dead.

1269
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:04,680
So starting things off, we've got Sniper Elite V2 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.

1270
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:08,040
Terra Online in the collector's edition as well.

1271
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:11,320
That's coming out on PC, which should be pretty awesome.

1272
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:15,200
Speaking of Mortal Kombat for the Vita, that is coming out this week.

1273
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:23,440
And... and I honestly think that's probably it, because it's pretty dead.

1274
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:26,840
I just wanna make sure I didn't miss anything.

1275
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,440
Yep, that's it.

1276
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:32,560
All right, traveling to Japan and looking at the releases over there in Japan.

1277
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:36,080
Nothing on the 3DS this week, which strikes me as kinda odd, but yeah, no, nothing, nothing.

1278
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:38,800
Oh my God, the system's dying!

1279
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:42,920
Well, how about the Vita, what's the Vita got this week?

1280
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:43,920
Also nothing.

1281
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:44,920
That's a very...

1282
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:45,920
That is also dying.

1283
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,240
They're all dying.

1284
01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:51,960
On the PlayStation 3 this week, Starhawk on May 10th, although I think that's really next

1285
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:52,960
week, actually.

1286
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:53,960
That's the week after, yeah.

1287
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:56,120
So, is there a holiday in Japan this week or something?

1288
01:05:56,120 --> 01:06:00,720
Because nothing on the PlayStation 3, and on the Xbox 360, nothing.

1289
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:05,000
Oh my God, all game systems are gonna die.

1290
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,240
They're all dying.

1291
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,680
All of them.

1292
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:09,680
Is it...

1293
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:13,580
I don't know what's going on, there must be something, but it's very... not a lot of releases

1294
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:14,580
till May 17th.

1295
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:16,960
Things are kinda slowing down over there.

1296
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:19,480
So I have nothing to report for Japanese releases.

1297
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:24,060
Hey, the good news is, for those of you who like to import games, your wallet is spared

1298
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:25,740
this month.

1299
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:28,080
There's a few in Europe.

1300
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:29,080
We have...

1301
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,660
Thank you, Golden Week is this week.

1302
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:31,660
That's right.

1303
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:32,660
The chatters all just chimed in.

1304
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:33,660
It's Golden Week.

1305
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:35,600
That's when everyone goes back to their hometown.

1306
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,600
Yep.

1307
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:37,600
Yep.

1308
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:40,600
What, no handheld games for the train ride there?

1309
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:41,600
No Animal Crossing?

1310
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:44,040
Rob, places are closed all week.

1311
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:48,120
I knew, see, I knew the chatters would know something cultural that I was missing.

1312
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:50,080
So yeah, Golden Week is the reason.

1313
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:52,240
You know, us Ignite gamers.

1314
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:55,420
I know, stupid Americans, sorry.

1315
01:06:55,420 --> 01:06:59,080
In Europe, on May 2nd, we have Velocity for the PSP.

1316
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:01,000
On May 3rd, we have Terra for PC.

1317
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:06,960
And on the 4th, we have Mud FIM, Motorcross World Championship, and that is it.

1318
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:07,960
Next!

1319
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:12,060
It must be Golden Week in the UK as well, huh?

1320
01:07:12,060 --> 01:07:13,060
It's no...

1321
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:14,060
I want a Golden Week.

1322
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:15,400
Why don't we have a Golden Week in the US?

1323
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:16,400
Because we have Spring Break.

1324
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:17,400
Yeah, but...

1325
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,640
I wish we had Golden Week, too.

1326
01:07:19,640 --> 01:07:21,880
Shit doesn't close on Spring Break.

1327
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:22,880
But...

1328
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:23,880
That's because people...

1329
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:24,880
Okay.

1330
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:27,040
People here have no respect for their hometown, end of story.

1331
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:31,080
We're comparing Golden Week to Spring Break.

1332
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:33,000
Let's examine the two.

1333
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:38,760
Golden Week, a great chance for me to go visit my family and really honor my family and,

1334
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:44,060
you know, just be kind of forced to spend time with those I love and what's important.

1335
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:49,280
Spring Break, bitches be getting drunk and topless and horny.

1336
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:50,920
Woo!

1337
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:54,720
I'm gonna get laid on Spring Break.

1338
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:55,720
We don't understand.

1339
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:56,720
Yeah!

1340
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:57,720
It's Golden Week in Mexico.

1341
01:07:57,720 --> 01:07:58,720
Because...

1342
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:01,360
See, it's Golden Week in Cancun.

1343
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:04,840
Yeah, I mean, because they're like, cha-ching!

1344
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:08,200
Here's our yearly revenue in one week.

1345
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:09,200
I'm re...

1346
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:13,680
It's Golden Peso Week, I don't know.

1347
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:14,680
Exactly.

1348
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:18,840
Slidekick in our chatroom says, Spring Break is better because it has wet t-shirt contests.

1349
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,680
I didn't see that in Golden Week.

1350
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,680
Can we move on, please?

1351
01:08:23,680 --> 01:08:25,800
Yes, we can move on.

1352
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:26,800
Loki.

1353
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:34,440
Maybe Golden Week all throughout the year if there's wet t-shirt contests involved.

1354
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:36,000
And drunk sluts.

1355
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,160
Well, for some people, that may be their hometown.

1356
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:40,960
That's just Friday.

1357
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:43,480
That's just Friday.

1358
01:08:43,480 --> 01:08:46,320
In here, it's always Friday.

1359
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:49,120
Uh, yes.

1360
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:52,320
Nintendo has some losses to report.

1361
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:57,040
Yeah, they may have lost a little bit of money with 3DS.

1362
01:08:57,040 --> 01:09:01,920
Four hundred and sixty-one point two million dollars in losses, to be exact.

1363
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:06,160
And of course, you know, they've kind of rebounded a little bit, but you know, the initial hit

1364
01:09:06,160 --> 01:09:12,800
from the new, you know, 3DS launch, and you know, the Redo's selling, well, also dropping

1365
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:18,120
the price of the Wii, and they're seeing, you know, the strong-in and other things factored

1366
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:19,120
into it.

1367
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:20,120
Not a big surprise.

1368
01:09:20,120 --> 01:09:22,160
Of course, their brand new fiscal year started.

1369
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:30,120
April first, and you know, they're aiming to not sell the 3DS under cost, because right

1370
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:36,460
now they're actually losing money on each system that's being put out.

1371
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:37,460
But not much.

1372
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:43,240
I mean, they're, I believe it's, uh, actually no, it doesn't say how much they're losing

1373
01:09:43,240 --> 01:09:44,240
there.

1374
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:45,240
I thought it was only like a few bucks.

1375
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:48,920
But, you know, they're taking losses on each system, and of course, Nintendo, unlike the

1376
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:52,680
other companies, they're actually like making profits on each piece of hardware that goes

1377
01:09:52,680 --> 01:10:00,200
out, which they were doing, obviously, when it was $250, but not necessarily now.

1378
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:06,480
And then of course, they're saying that with the Wii U launch, and the Wii console, by

1379
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:12,320
the end of next fiscal year, which would be March 31st, 2013, they're gonna have combined

1380
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:23,800
sales of 10.5 million units, um, during that whole year, um, eh, maybe.

1381
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:31,680
I guess, well fiscal 2012, they sold 9.84 million Wii units, so they're planning on

1382
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:33,240
growing that a bit more.

1383
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:39,320
Honestly, I don't see the Wii selling as fast as, you know, it was before.

1384
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:42,440
Although, if they announce another price drop, because there's a new concept coming out.

1385
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:45,800
I was gonna say a price drop is, that, that has to factor into this somehow.

1386
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:49,880
If they drop the price again, that could be interesting.

1387
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:52,800
Is that Wii, isn't the Wii already like 99 bucks, or?

1388
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,440
No, it's still like 149.

1389
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:59,480
Okay, so let's say they're gonna come out and the Wii is 99 bucks, that is, that's gonna

1390
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:00,480
be hard to ignore.

1391
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:03,920
Especially for the, like, you know what the big audience is for that, it's nobody that

1392
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:07,560
listens to this show, unless you have like a 5 to 12 year old.

1393
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:08,560
But here's my problem.

1394
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:10,680
It's a huge sweet spot for the Wii.

1395
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:15,440
That is a huge sweet spot for the Wii, and it will cannibalize the Wii U's sales.

1396
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:20,480
Cause, I can buy this brand new console, it's basically a Wii, but it has better graphics

1397
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:27,200
for $2.99, or I can pay $99 and get a Wii and play all these Mario games that I really

1398
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:30,800
wanna play, and, um, that's it.

1399
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,680
Then later on I'll upgrade to the, you know, the new Wii.

1400
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:38,600
If there was a new Xbox or Playstation this year, I might agree with you, but I actually

1401
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:43,600
think core gamer interest may be a little higher, especially if Nintendo does it right

1402
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:46,480
and throws out a new Zelda game with this, although I'm not expecting it.

1403
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:47,480
I'm not expecting it.

1404
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:53,080
Or a Metroid, or something, you know, that the core gamers are gonna jizz over.

1405
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:57,400
Just like seeing the lineup, just like kind of the whispers and stuff of their lineup.

1406
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:03,500
A lot of it is like, Batman Arkham City, great, I get to play it on the Wii U, but it's been

1407
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:07,920
out for a fucking year, and you know, Darksiders 2, okay, well that might be delayed by the

1408
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:12,280
time we get there to, you know, the launch of the Wii, but it'll be out, like, Ninja

1409
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:16,280
Gaiden 3, a game that sucked on the Xbox 360 and PS3.

1410
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:20,000
Look, I think we really don't know though, because what Nintendo was trying to do with

1411
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,200
that was say, hey, we can compete with everybody else now.

1412
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:26,960
We're gonna have all the games that the other systems have, so leave us alone.

1413
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:29,200
We don't really know what's coming.

1414
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:31,240
I really do know what's coming.

1415
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:35,240
Batman Arkham City is coming for the Wii U, I mean.

1416
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:39,280
What if, heaven forbid, Loki, what if they're actually keeping some secrets?

1417
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:40,280
They may have some first party secrets.

1418
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:41,760
Animal Crossing Wii U.

1419
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,080
Oh god.

1420
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:46,520
I'm not buying it for, I'm sorry, I will not buy a system for Animal Crossing.

1421
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:48,480
Now your little, your little Wii pad is a screwball.

1422
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:57,640
I did that for GameDram, okay, but I will not do that for, no, seriously, it's just,

1423
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:00,440
they're probably, they will probably have a Zelda game or something like that.

1424
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:02,040
That would be pretty smart.

1425
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:04,760
I don't think a Pikmin game is gonna launch that goddamn system, but.

1426
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:07,900
I hope I'm not stepping on a story coming up later, because I remember reading this

1427
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:12,260
earlier, but, you know, Nintendo has been talking about a new franchise.

1428
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:14,520
Like maybe it's time for a new character.

1429
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:15,520
Cool.

1430
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:18,120
And I'm down with that, absolutely.

1431
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:19,560
They need some new franchises.

1432
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:20,560
Why not?

1433
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:24,160
Well, I don't think they need franchises as bad as some other systems, but.

1434
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:26,040
Well, I think that they should have some new franchises.

1435
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:27,040
Why not?

1436
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:29,640
I mean, see, I mean, fuck.

1437
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:32,600
Story's kind of getting old, you know.

1438
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:37,360
Maybe about time, Kid Icarus seems to have revived successfully enough.

1439
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:40,320
Maybe when it's time you start looking at a franchise and put out a game for it in a

1440
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:44,480
while that might be of the racing genre.

1441
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:48,880
Although I do not disagree, what about a just new, something that doesn't exist yet?

1442
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:53,040
I mean, Animal Crossing didn't exist until, well, here in America, the GameCube, but the

1443
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,040
64.

1444
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:55,040
You know, I completely agree with you.

1445
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:56,040
You know it hasn't existed yet?

1446
01:13:56,040 --> 01:14:00,600
The fucking sequel to Excite Truck is what we need, is we need to excite truck too.

1447
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:04,600
No, seriously, the best racing game on the Wii, eh, let's just piss it away.

1448
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:08,240
We're gonna make a game with fucking mini games in the middle of a race.

1449
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:09,600
That was geniusly stupid.

1450
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,160
Look, I have more Wii stuff I gotta get out of here.

1451
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:17,280
This is important because when the Wii U launches, one thing Nintendo's committed to, oh, I

1452
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:22,440
should say, sorry, excuse me, misspoke, exploring, but when I read something like this, I go,

1453
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:23,760
they're gonna do it.

1454
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:29,240
Digital distribution of full retail games, starting on the 3DS, not even just the Wii

1455
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:34,440
U, but starting on the 3DS with New Super Mario Brothers 2, will be available, digital

1456
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:39,440
download as well as full retail release, but they made it very clear, choice.

1457
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,440
You have a choice.

1458
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,160
Apparently- And no price break.

1459
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:46,440
They are being aggressive about the Wii U.

1460
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:51,480
Iwata did announce Wii U games will be both in stores and digital distribution at launch.

1461
01:14:51,480 --> 01:14:54,360
See, I thought I had heard it confirmed in there, so I guess the 3DS is the one that's

1462
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:57,240
being explored, but the Wii U, this is going to happen.

1463
01:14:57,240 --> 01:15:00,680
No, it is actually being done with the Wii, er, the 3DS.

1464
01:15:00,680 --> 01:15:02,000
They said they were gonna be doing it.

1465
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,560
Oh, I, I was serious, they're exploring it, but that tells me it's gonna happen.

1466
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:11,200
So anyhow, retailers will also be able to sell download codes, which is interesting.

1467
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,920
Why would you do that?

1468
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:17,860
I mean, I understand why you would do that, so you can take your games with you.

1469
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:22,440
But remember, they tie to the system, not the account, which is very important.

1470
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:27,200
I'm assuming if you ever upgrade your system, there's a way to transfer the licenses, because

1471
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:32,440
I think there is with the ambassador program on the DS, but, you know, just kinda keep-

1472
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:36,600
So anyhow, oh, yeah, they do, I guess they came out later and said, yes, we are doing

1473
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:37,600
it.

1474
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:42,040
Uh, August 2012 is when New Super Mario Brothers 2 is going to be the first game that's out.

1475
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:46,440
Uh, packaged and digital formats, consumers can make the choice.

1476
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:51,480
Also a game called Onitore, which is a temp name, is also supposed to be sold like this.

1477
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:53,520
It's a brain age game.

1478
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:54,520
Yeah.

1479
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:55,520
Interesting.

1480
01:15:55,520 --> 01:16:02,760
Uh, one other thing about the 3DS, uh, it's all gonna be connected on- excuse me, the

1481
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:08,840
Wii U and the 3DS are all connected through Nintendo eShop, and they say, quote, the majority,

1482
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:14,240
key word, of first party 3DS and Wii U games will be sold this way.

1483
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:19,840
The dual distribution strategy, digital downloads on launch day, you'll be able to get 16 digit

1484
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:24,080
codes through the Nintendo eShop if you want to go buy it in a store or whatever.

1485
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,360
That doesn't mean that I'm gonna open up a box and then it's gonna be a card, does it?

1486
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,640
Cause that's kinda shitty.

1487
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:34,200
Um, no, but Sony has tried that before, and they had Potapon 2, it was like that.

1488
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:36,100
It was like, here's a case!

1489
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:38,680
Those Vita games aren't far from it.

1490
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:42,120
There is nothing in that Vita case but a little plastic slot to put in that cartridge.

1491
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:45,760
You know what, at least that's something that I can sell back at some point if I feel like

1492
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,120
it or sell it used.

1493
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:48,120
That's true.

1494
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:54,600
Um, but, once again though, I mean, this sounds like a great idea, but then we have to realize,

1495
01:16:54,600 --> 01:17:00,120
you know, it works for the Vita, I think it could work for the 3DS, but when we're talking

1496
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:05,400
games that are gonna be significantly larger in size, and I'm talking about like actual

1497
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:10,880
storage space on like a blu-ray disc, it's gonna get fucking annoying.

1498
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:18,360
Yeah, I can download a title, you know, on my Wii U, but, I don't know, why would you?

1499
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:22,920
But at the same time, the 3DS, it makes sense because people want to take their games with

1500
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:23,920
them.

1501
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:26,840
They don't wanna have to carry a bunch of cartridges, they can, you know, store a bunch

1502
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:31,440
of games on there and that be done with it, but for the Wii U it doesn't make any sense.

1503
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:35,320
I mean, I understand some people download full game, full digital games on like the

1504
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:37,800
PS3 and stuff, but you can upgrade the hard drive and that thing.

1505
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:42,800
I have a 500 gig hard drive, so that doesn't really bother me too much, but, you know,

1506
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:48,280
if they're, they better have adequate storage, and it also takes a really long time.

1507
01:17:48,280 --> 01:17:53,960
Like I downloaded Infamous 1, which is a good 8 gig game, that took a couple hours.

1508
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:59,480
You know, I'm not gonna wanna do that for a game that's larger than a DVD-R.

1509
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:03,700
You know, we're talking like, you know, 6, double that size, maybe even triple that size.

1510
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:06,040
That's gonna, why would you do that and kill your bandwidth?

1511
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:09,400
Alright, let me give one other quote here about the license rights, so we can talk about

1512
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:10,400
that real quick.

1513
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:15,800
Iwata did state that the 3DS retail games will be stored in the SD memory card and be

1514
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:19,960
playable only with the hardware to which it was downloaded, so that, you know, unlike

1515
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:24,240
how you get to share a packaged software, the consumer cannot share the software with

1516
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:29,320
other 3DS systems owned by other members of the family or friends.

1517
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:33,640
But that's not any different than the eShop games that are there now, like say VVVVV or

1518
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:34,640
whatever, it's the same way.

1519
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:38,920
It's too bad they couldn't have just added a feature to the cards where you can download

1520
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:43,640
it to a certain system, and once it's downloaded to that system, it marks something in the

1521
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:47,280
card that, you know, shows that it's been downloaded to a system and you can't download

1522
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:48,280
it again.

1523
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:53,240
But you can still play the card, or you can revoke your privileges and then it, you know,

1524
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:56,960
clears out whatever that is, and granted I'm sure someone will hack, or could possibly

1525
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:57,960
hack it, but...

1526
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:00,680
Sort of like how iTunes has authorize, authorizing computers.

1527
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:01,960
Something like that, yeah.

1528
01:19:01,960 --> 01:19:03,360
Yeah, that's a good way to think about it.

1529
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:07,440
I mean, but that would have required them to have, you know, forethought, you know,

1530
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:11,320
for this stuff, and since they didn't do that at launch, and it's been out for a year now,

1531
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:12,960
probably not gonna happen.

1532
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:16,520
Porkchop in our chatroom says if the market goes entirely digital, it's a massive middle

1533
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:17,960
finger to the gamer.

1534
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:20,760
And ShadowNextGen says that'll eventually happen, Porkchop.

1535
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:21,760
It's inevitable.

1536
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,200
It's not gonna happen.

1537
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:25,280
It's not gonna happen any time soon.

1538
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:28,240
I don't think it'll happen soon, but...

1539
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:29,240
It's not.

1540
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:30,920
The consumer can ultimately reject it.

1541
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:31,920
The PSP Go.

1542
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:34,800
I want a return of Neo Geo size cartridges.

1543
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:37,320
The PSP Go was rejected by the consumer.

1544
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:42,700
It's not gonna happen because, first off, the consumer likes having physical product,

1545
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:46,400
and the reason why they like having, you know, physical product is because it feels like

1546
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,300
they actually own something.

1547
01:19:48,300 --> 01:19:53,040
Having everything digital that's basically allowing, like, a third party company, like,

1548
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:56,240
you know, Intender or whatever, they can revoke the privileges whenever they want.

1549
01:19:56,240 --> 01:20:01,140
And just to be fair, ShadowNextGen in the chat says I didn't say it would happen soon, so...

1550
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:04,280
I don't think it's gonna happen any time in the near future, and...

1551
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:05,560
It's just, it's too convenient.

1552
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:11,200
It's more convenient to go to a store, I mean, seriously, am I going to, uh, spend like ten

1553
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:16,740
minutes driving to a local store and picking up a copy of a game, oh, that's such an inconvenience,

1554
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:19,360
or wait six hours for the same game to fucking download?

1555
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:24,280
I'll tell you it's fucking convenient, and not to sound like a commercial, but, um, Amazon

1556
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:27,780
will have that fucker on my doorstep when I get home from work.

1557
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:29,360
That's convenient to me.

1558
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:34,660
It's, there are ways that are more convenient than, but the thing is, they want everyone

1559
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:38,520
to think digital is where it's at, because they make the most money with that, and they

1560
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:41,280
have the most control over their product that way.

1561
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:47,120
It kind of sort of eliminates piracy a little bit, I mean, it's not, not really, uh...

1562
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:50,920
We need to, we need to take a step back, you guys, we need to take a step back to simpler

1563
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:51,920
times.

1564
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:55,080
We need to go back to when digital distribution wasn't even a thing.

1565
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:56,080
It was nothing.

1566
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:58,240
You know how you digitally distributed something?

1567
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:02,200
You got it on the back of a truck to your nearby Chuck E. Cheese.

1568
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:03,200
That was distribution.

1569
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:06,920
The classic game of the week.

1570
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:11,440
Dark Soccer's gonna take a trip down memory lane and find a game inside the gaming vault

1571
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:18,040
that she thinks, hey, listen up, Iwata digital mofos.

1572
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:22,280
This is a true classic that you all should play right freaking now.

1573
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:25,680
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week, the first classic game of the week involved?

1574
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:28,800
Well, this is also one that comes from Dan, so thank him for that.

1575
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:33,680
And I'm going to start off by reading actually the, the spoiler, the splash for the original

1576
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:34,680
poster.

1577
01:21:34,680 --> 01:21:35,680
Okay.

1578
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:38,480
First the pinball universe, now the world of video.

1579
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:40,920
Once again, Williams reigns supreme.

1580
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:41,920
Mmm.

1581
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:42,920
Defender.

1582
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:43,920
Defender.

1583
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:51,360
And, uh, is, I mean, how can we not go back to the real classics there, you know?

1584
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:57,880
So defender came out for the arcade, um, done by Williams in 1980, which is a shooting game,

1585
01:21:57,880 --> 01:22:00,320
all 2d back in the day.

1586
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,320
Hi.

1587
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:05,500
And, um, you have to basically defeat all these different invading aliens while protecting

1588
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:07,400
your astronauts.

1589
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:11,960
It was developed by Eugene Jarvis, who I've actually at classic gaming expo a couple,

1590
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:16,940
a few years back, I got to sit in on a panel with him and it was just awesome listening

1591
01:22:16,940 --> 01:22:18,060
to this guy talk about it.

1592
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:21,300
By the way, this video that we're playing the audio from is already quiet and this game

1593
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:23,520
didn't really have a lot of, you know, I didn't have a lot of noise.

1594
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:28,280
It was pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, not a lot to hear, but there are some laser noises for

1595
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:29,280
you.

1596
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:33,840
Um, anyway, uh, this was the first game that Eugene Jarvis programmed.

1597
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:35,840
He was a pinball programmer before that.

1598
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:39,920
Um, and he was inspired by space invaders and asteroids.

1599
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:46,240
Um, the plan was to display the game at the amusement and music operators association.

1600
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:48,320
Um, but it was delayed.

1601
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:54,400
Um, the game itself though was highly successful, sold 55,000 units and it was their best selling

1602
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,760
arcade game.

1603
01:22:56,760 --> 01:23:04,640
And uh, basically, uh, it's the game pretty much that put, you know, Eugene Jarvis's name

1604
01:23:04,640 --> 01:23:10,980
amongst, you know, the, the top contributors to the video game industry there is.

1605
01:23:10,980 --> 01:23:13,480
So that's pretty cool.

1606
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:20,460
At any rate, um, when it was developed, it was, uh, Williams, uh, first attempt at any

1607
01:23:20,460 --> 01:23:22,540
video game there.

1608
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:28,160
The earlier one that they had was basically a version of Pong and, uh, they were really,

1609
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:33,920
really trying to cash in on how popular video games were getting in 1979.

1610
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:41,320
So they had basically one of their best pinball, uh, uh, programmers get right to it.

1611
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:45,520
He also, um, he headed the department and there's other like big names that were involved

1612
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:46,520
with that.

1613
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:51,840
Uh, Larry Damar, Sam Dicker, uh, Paul Dassault, um, they were all involved in this.

1614
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:55,840
They worked, uh, under him as the head.

1615
01:23:55,840 --> 01:24:00,920
So basically, um, Jarvis, just going into the development history, spent three to four

1616
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:07,520
months, um, working on different versions of Taito space invaders and Atari's asteroids

1617
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:10,960
and, uh, tried to work games that had similar mechanics.

1618
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:15,880
Asteroids, of course, was, uh, vector, um, had a special monitor, but this one he wanted

1619
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:19,040
to really work on a conventional monitor.

1620
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:24,420
So, uh, basically they just, uh, took what they liked from asteroids being the warping

1621
01:24:24,420 --> 01:24:28,080
effects they really liked and then wanted a player to be able to fly back and forth

1622
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:29,760
across the screen.

1623
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:38,600
Um, he only wanted it to go, um, from left to right, but a person who I have met convinced

1624
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:40,000
him to make it scroll around.

1625
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,720
You know who that is?

1626
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:43,720
Who?

1627
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:44,720
Steve Ritchie.

1628
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:45,720
Oh.

1629
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:49,360
Who was the man that designed, he actually was the voice of the Black Knight and the

1630
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:51,960
voice of the skull in, uh, No Fear.

1631
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:53,720
Was he the voice of Sinstar?

1632
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:54,720
Beware.

1633
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:55,720
Yes.

1634
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:56,720
I lit, that guy's awesome.

1635
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:57,720
I think, I think it was him.

1636
01:24:57,720 --> 01:24:59,160
I want him to do bumpers for VoG.

1637
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:01,200
But I could talk to him.

1638
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:02,200
Sweet.

1639
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:09,280
But, um, he, uh, he's also the guy that designed, uh, Twilight Zone and Black Knight.

1640
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:10,280
Steve Ritchie.

1641
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:12,920
He's, and he is the sweetest, sweetest guy.

1642
01:25:12,920 --> 01:25:17,480
Anyway, um, moving forward, he basically was the guy that suggested that it should scroll

1643
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:18,480
in either direction.

1644
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:25,800
So, it took six months to develop it and, uh, they really pushed it through and, uh,

1645
01:25:25,800 --> 01:25:32,680
so now, um, they have the, basically they added in the Planetscape background as sort

1646
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:33,720
of an afterthought.

1647
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:39,240
And if you'll notice, it's only a pixel wide, those lines, because the hardware wasn't powerful

1648
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:42,640
enough to do anything better.

1649
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:46,320
So basically after that six months, they really pushed it for, uh, for the try to get it done

1650
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:48,760
by, um, AMOA.

1651
01:25:48,760 --> 01:25:53,200
But it took a lot later to do and they incorporated more things.

1652
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:56,320
They had the swarmers, the pods, all the different gameplay.

1653
01:25:56,320 --> 01:26:02,400
And then they had, um, they created erasable programmable read-only memory chips for the

1654
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:05,400
game to install the cabinets, but they didn't work.

1655
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:08,720
So they actually had to do more to get it to work.

1656
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:10,560
They got the attract mode operational.

1657
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:14,840
They got all of the stuff done and finally had it playable.

1658
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:18,760
So the game itself is basically, um, it's monaural sound.

1659
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:26,720
It's pixel on CRT and it's being, uh, run by a Motorola again, uh, 6809 central processing

1660
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:27,720
chip.

1661
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:31,380
So, which is big stuff in 1980.

1662
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:36,600
So the game actually, um, it didn't really attract a lot of attention in 1980 when it

1663
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:42,720
came out, but it, uh, ended up, uh, being well received in the arcades.

1664
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:46,320
And there were tons of crowds during the play testing.

1665
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:49,440
So they actually did a cocktail version of this as well.

1666
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:52,000
So like I said, they sold over 55,000 units worldwide.

1667
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,600
I want a cocktail machine so fucking bad.

1668
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:58,560
By 2004, the game was a collector's item.

1669
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:04,040
Um, the upright cabinets you could still find, but the cocktail tables, of course, you know

1670
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:07,640
how that went, you can hardly find them at all.

1671
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:13,960
And, uh, it was actually considered one of the most successful games in 1981.

1672
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:14,960
It outperformed Pac-Man.

1673
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:15,960
Just saying.

1674
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:16,960
Huh?

1675
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:22,880
I mean, the graphics at its time or completely revolutionary.

1676
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:25,480
It did things that you hadn't seen in the game before.

1677
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:31,320
And you know, all this by a guy who had not ever done a video game before.

1678
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:32,320
He didn't pinball.

1679
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:34,760
But sometimes it just takes a different perspective.

1680
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:35,760
You know?

1681
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:36,760
Yeah.

1682
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:41,240
But I mean, and since then we've had so many different games, uh, reference it so many

1683
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:45,320
different games, uh, actually work off of things of it.

1684
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:50,680
There were software bugs in the game that allowed people to extend their length of time.

1685
01:27:50,680 --> 01:27:52,880
And there was another one that kept track on how it scores.

1686
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:55,200
So basically people could keep earning extra lives and stuff.

1687
01:27:55,200 --> 01:28:01,440
I mean, we're talking early game hacking, you know, this, you know, hacking, you know,

1688
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:03,720
Street Fighter X Tekken is nothing new.

1689
01:28:03,720 --> 01:28:05,960
People were doing it in the 80s.

1690
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:10,160
Um, you remember the dude that did Pac-Man Fever?

1691
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:11,160
Little Buckner and Garcia?

1692
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:12,280
Yeah, of course.

1693
01:28:12,280 --> 01:28:19,040
This was, uh, they did a, uh, um, song called The Defender on that album.

1694
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:25,360
And Beastie Boys actually referred to it in Body Movin' because Beastie Boys are awesome.

1695
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:28,920
So I mean, and if you think about this, how many other games do we have come out since

1696
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:35,040
then that, like my, my favorite game, Fantasy Zone, is that not pretty much Defender?

1697
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:37,520
It inspired, heavily inspired.

1698
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:38,520
With Cutesy-ness?

1699
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:44,200
You know, we had, and of course this, you know, basically opened the door to all kinds

1700
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:48,720
of other games like, um, GORF and Phoenix.

1701
01:28:48,720 --> 01:28:56,880
So just saying, you know, as far as remakes, um, there was, uh, a game called Stargate

1702
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:00,000
that was considered a sequel to Defender.

1703
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,600
Um, different elements.

1704
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:03,960
Uh, Midway put out Strike Force.

1705
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:08,320
Some folks in chat, by the way, talking about, uh, Defender 2 on the NES, which was Stargate,

1706
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:09,320
yeah.

1707
01:29:09,320 --> 01:29:13,920
You know, as far as, uh, other home versions came out, like Defense Command, Reptile, Drop

1708
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:17,280
Zone, Protector 2, that copied the design.

1709
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:24,920
Um, Chopper Command for Atari 2600 and, uh, Choplifter for Apple II, um, were, again, mimics

1710
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:25,920
of Defender.

1711
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:26,920
I didn't even think about that.

1712
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:27,920
You're right.

1713
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:28,920
Chopper Command really was the same damn game.

1714
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:29,920
Yeah.

1715
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:30,920
I remember.

1716
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:31,920
I, uh, my friend owned that.

1717
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:32,920
We used to play the shit out of that.

1718
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:37,720
And it's been released on so many different, you know, re-releases like, uh, 1996's Williams

1719
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:43,160
Arcade Greatest Hits, the 2000 Midway's Arcade, um, Greatest Arcade Hits, and 2003 Midway

1720
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:44,720
Arcade Treasures.

1721
01:29:44,720 --> 01:29:47,840
We also, um, on Shockwave.com, you can play Defender.

1722
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:53,240
Sorry, I just wanted to look really quickly at, uh, Chopper Command here on the Atari

1723
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:54,240
2600.

1724
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:57,960
Yeah, see, you have to protect your dudes on the bottom.

1725
01:29:57,960 --> 01:29:59,520
Yeah, the little trucks on the bottom.

1726
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:00,520
Yeah.

1727
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:01,520
Yeah.

1728
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:02,520
Did they get lifted up by the choppers?

1729
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:03,520
I forgot how that worked.

1730
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:06,400
Oh, no, they're just getting, but that's the difference.

1731
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:07,400
They don't get lifted up.

1732
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:08,400
They just get, like, attacked.

1733
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:09,400
Yeah.

1734
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:11,040
You have to save the little astronauts in Defender.

1735
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:13,360
That guy's not very good at Chopper Command.

1736
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:23,960
But anyway, I mean, and then, um, in 2002, there, um, there was the sequel that, uh,

1737
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:32,160
that was just called Defender that, uh, was, uh, uh, believe was the 3D that was, that

1738
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:33,160
worked similarly.

1739
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:35,160
So, but yeah, Defender.

1740
01:30:35,160 --> 01:30:37,800
There it is, your classic game of the week, Defender.

1741
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:38,800
Good choice.

1742
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:42,000
Now I, now I actually really do need to get a hold of Steve Ritchie.

1743
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:47,240
All right, that's going to do it for part A of Orange Launch Radio, but don't go anywhere.

1744
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:52,080
Part B is coming up next here on VOG, and we're going to start off with some big news

1745
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:55,240
in part B, so I hope you guys don't go anywhere, because we'll be right back after this with

1746
01:30:55,240 --> 01:31:03,600
more of Orange Launch Radio.

1747
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:08,080
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Launch Radio and our inaugural broadcast here on

1748
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:12,520
the VOG, vognetwork.com, the voice of geeks network.

1749
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:16,400
And right now, just three shows on the actual radio network, VOG network will be more than

1750
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:20,000
just a radio station, but that's kind of the, that's the centerpiece of the dinner table

1751
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,360
right now is the radio station.

1752
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:26,040
Uh, just ourselves and, uh, Bobby Blackwolf, who you heard before us and the great folks

1753
01:31:26,040 --> 01:31:32,800
at under sedation live in their 11th year, God bless them or whatever you believe in,

1754
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:37,440
uh, eight o'clock on Saturday Pacific, 11 o'clock Eastern.

1755
01:31:37,440 --> 01:31:41,840
They're late night cause they're dirty, but it's a good time, a little dirty, but it's

1756
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:42,880
a good time.

1757
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:44,000
You should definitely tune in.

1758
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,680
I'll say this cause I know Jessica's in the chat right now.

1759
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:49,900
Jessica will whip Travis into shape on Saturday night.

1760
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:54,520
So if you want to hear him get a whooping tune in on Saturday, no, it's, it is a really

1761
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:55,520
good time.

1762
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:59,280
Uh, anyhow, I got to go back on that show and guess sometime for sure.

1763
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:06,240
Anyway, we are here and, uh, talking about video games and thank God some late breaking

1764
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:22,920
news, some late breaking news here on the VOG and orange lounge radio breaking news.

1765
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:25,640
And we have to go to our correspondent for this story.

1766
01:32:25,640 --> 01:32:26,920
This isn't even my thing.

1767
01:32:26,920 --> 01:32:31,520
This was a, we've got to go to our core respondent for this story.

1768
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:35,840
So I'm looking them up to give them a call right now, except, Oh, there he is.

1769
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:37,280
I always look under the wrong name here.

1770
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:40,480
So let's, uh, give our correspondent a little call here so we can talk about the breaking

1771
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:45,080
news this evening, all the way in New York city.

1772
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:46,080
Rama is joining us.

1773
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:47,080
Hey Rama, you there?

1774
01:32:47,080 --> 01:32:48,080
Hey, I'm right here.

1775
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:49,080
Sky.

1776
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:50,080
How are you guys out in the Sacramento studios?

1777
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:55,320
I'm relieved because the show is actually online tonight because trust me, there was

1778
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:58,360
a plan B in case VOG didn't work, but it works.

1779
01:32:58,360 --> 01:33:01,600
I mean, despite the hiccup earlier, that was a Comcast fail.

1780
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:02,600
We're shit.

1781
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:03,600
We're used to those.

1782
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:06,960
We've, we've had 10 years of those on the other networks we've been in.

1783
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:09,040
So otherwise VOG's working great.

1784
01:33:09,040 --> 01:33:12,480
And I got to say this, I am so happy.

1785
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:13,800
I can't even tell you.

1786
01:33:13,800 --> 01:33:18,560
We have hit higher numbers tonight on this new network than I've seen in a long, long,

1787
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:19,560
long time.

1788
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:22,760
And I think a lot of that really is just the combined forces of Bobby's audience and our

1789
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:26,480
audience and you know, the curious looky-loos, the people that Geek Life brought in just

1790
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:29,320
all kind of, you know, joining together tonight.

1791
01:33:29,320 --> 01:33:31,060
And I, I'm just so happy.

1792
01:33:31,060 --> 01:33:33,880
And I hope the momentum continues through the few weeks.

1793
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:34,880
I'm all for that.

1794
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:35,880
Yeah, me too.

1795
01:33:35,880 --> 01:33:38,400
So anyway, it's not, you're not calling us to talk about VOG tonight.

1796
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,840
You have some news for us, I guess you become privy too.

1797
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:41,840
What's going on Rama?

1798
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:42,840
Yes, yes, yes.

1799
01:33:42,840 --> 01:33:43,840
I do have news.

1800
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:49,440
Now recently with Anime Jam Session, we've gotten connected to another podcast out here

1801
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:51,260
called the Brooklyn Otaku.

1802
01:33:51,260 --> 01:33:54,120
We've been joining forces and working on some projects.

1803
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:59,920
Now one of the hosts of the Brooklyn Otaku hooked me up with some very privy information

1804
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:03,040
today at the Sakura Matsuri.

1805
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:04,040
What's that?

1806
01:34:04,040 --> 01:34:05,040
First off, Sakura Matsuri...

1807
01:34:05,040 --> 01:34:06,040
Cherry Blossom Festival.

1808
01:34:06,040 --> 01:34:07,040
Cherry Blossom.

1809
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:08,040
Thank you.

1810
01:34:08,040 --> 01:34:11,080
I was going to let him explain, but that's all right.

1811
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:12,080
There he goes.

1812
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:14,520
Fair enough.

1813
01:34:14,520 --> 01:34:19,280
So Sakura Matsuri, you ran into your friends at Brooklyn Otaku and?

1814
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:25,320
One of the hosts there has told me that the return of one of the greatest arcades in New

1815
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:27,600
York City will be back.

1816
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:31,520
Chinatown Fair is reopening this Friday.

1817
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:32,520
Yay!

1818
01:34:32,520 --> 01:34:34,320
Chinatown Fair reopening this Friday.

1819
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:36,600
I've never been to Chinatown Fair.

1820
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:42,360
The legendary arcade in these parts was Arcade Infinity, which when I say in these parts

1821
01:34:42,360 --> 01:34:44,240
I mean six hours away.

1822
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:46,400
But what makes Chinatown Fair so special?

1823
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:49,120
Why is this big news for the East Coast folks?

1824
01:34:49,120 --> 01:34:52,080
It's like the bastion of arcade gaming.

1825
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:57,440
This is where you go to play all the greatest, at the time, fighting games, dancing games,

1826
01:34:57,440 --> 01:34:58,440
all types of video games.

1827
01:34:58,440 --> 01:34:59,880
This is where you came.

1828
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:05,080
It's like nowhere else in New York City you could go except here because it was quiet

1829
01:35:05,080 --> 01:35:07,120
or loud, however you want to take it.

1830
01:35:07,120 --> 01:35:08,120
And it was fun.

1831
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:12,840
Plus there was also a chicken that could tell you a fortune.

1832
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:16,600
Arcade Infinity did not have a fortune teller chicken.

1833
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:17,600
That's right.

1834
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:18,600
It did not have a fortune telling chicken.

1835
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:19,600
It did have um jammerlami.

1836
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:24,040
I didn't go to any of the other shops around there so they could have had fortune telling

1837
01:35:24,040 --> 01:35:25,040
chickens.

1838
01:35:25,040 --> 01:35:29,040
Is there a big opening plan thing scheduled?

1839
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:35,000
I do believe the grand opening will be this Friday and from my understanding they're changing

1840
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,000
things around a little bit.

1841
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:41,480
It's going to be more of a Chuck E. Cheese, Dave and Buster style place.

1842
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:44,880
I shudder when I hear Chuck E. Cheese but Dave and Buster, does that mean they're selling

1843
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:45,880
booze?

1844
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:49,520
Exclusive Chinatown Fair to carry booze in the parking lot.

1845
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:51,240
I hope so.

1846
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:55,080
I do believe I'll be going down there Friday after work to check it out and see what's

1847
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:56,080
going on.

1848
01:35:56,080 --> 01:36:03,200
Well then I need picks and stuff for the VOG website feature stuff that will come later.

1849
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:04,200
Oh definitely.

1850
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:07,360
Dave and Buster's they mean not letting kids in.

1851
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:09,720
Yeah that'll be great.

1852
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:12,200
Exclusive kids band from the new Chinatown Fair.

1853
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:13,200
That's good.

1854
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:16,160
Well they were kind of sort of banned before.

1855
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:20,960
Pretty much if you were in school and you were there during school hours you were escorted

1856
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:25,080
out of the place but I've never been there during those times to see if they actually

1857
01:36:25,080 --> 01:36:26,080
enforce that rule.

1858
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:30,040
Alright well thank you for sharing the news with us Rama and thanks to your friends at

1859
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:31,040
The Other Show too.

1860
01:36:31,040 --> 01:36:34,280
Since we have you on the line I know you like to call in during the show later anyway.

1861
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:38,800
Is there anything else you want to share with us tonight about your week?

1862
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:43,640
Yeah but how about I save that for that portion of the show.

1863
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:46,520
Okay then I guess we'll wait for that call later on.

1864
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:49,160
Yeah if I can't make it on I can't make it on.

1865
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:50,160
It is what it is.

1866
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:51,160
We have a lot of new listeners.

1867
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:53,560
Those will let the fresh blood in you know.

1868
01:36:53,560 --> 01:36:55,960
Yeah you gotta let other people have a turn once in a while Rama.

1869
01:36:55,960 --> 01:36:57,120
Alright take care buddy.

1870
01:36:57,120 --> 01:36:59,560
We're gonna get back to the show.

1871
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:02,520
Oh he hung up there you go.

1872
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:06,200
Alright there it is breaking news and also breaking news exclusive Loki's mic was off

1873
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:08,560
that whole time says the chatters.

1874
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:10,160
I don't know whatever.

1875
01:37:10,160 --> 01:37:11,160
Can we hear you?

1876
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:13,600
I still can't hear you.

1877
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:14,800
Is mine on?

1878
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:18,480
I hear my voice.

1879
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:22,000
Your mic is, talk for a minute for me.

1880
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Hello.

1881
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,280
Oh god.

1882
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:28,240
Didn't you, you didn't fiddle with anything over here?

1883
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:29,240
No.

1884
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:30,240
Oh.

1885
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:31,240
Rob had one mute.

1886
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:37,200
You fiddled with my microphone you bastard.

1887
01:37:37,200 --> 01:37:39,200
I had nothing intelligent to interject.

1888
01:37:39,200 --> 01:37:46,560
And the fail award of the evening goes to Rob for mute button fail.

1889
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:47,560
Like I'd fiddle with a microphone.

1890
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:48,560
What do you think I'd do?

1891
01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:49,560
Hey!

1892
01:37:49,560 --> 01:37:50,560
Chords!

1893
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:51,560
I'm gonna yank on those.

1894
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:52,560
You'd do it?

1895
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:55,160
No he's gonna pretend he's Sanrio and chew on them.

1896
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:57,160
I've never done that before.

1897
01:37:57,160 --> 01:37:58,160
Alright whatever.

1898
01:37:58,160 --> 01:38:03,320
I'm gonna hop up on the table and rage through the like.

1899
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:05,880
So Rob this coffee is delicious thank you.

1900
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:06,880
No you're welcome anytime.

1901
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:09,400
I've just put up two pictures on the OLR website.

1902
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:10,680
Sure that's what they wanted to see.

1903
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:13,080
One of them was coffee and the other one was my mouse pad.

1904
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:16,320
Alright I'll take a short, we're gonna get to rapid fire news but sure I'll take a question.

1905
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:20,120
It's the show where every gamer has a voice so sometimes we get thrown random ass questions

1906
01:38:20,120 --> 01:38:22,760
in the VoG chat room and I'll answer them.

1907
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:26,640
Nietzsche, OLR did you guys happen to play any of the Diablo 3 open beta?

1908
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:28,360
If so what class did you play?

1909
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:29,360
Hell no.

1910
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:32,760
I didn't play the open beta but I played the closed beta back in October and I played a

1911
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:34,280
monk and it was a lot of fun.

1912
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:37,400
I played monk and witch doctor and I really preferred monk.

1913
01:38:37,400 --> 01:38:38,680
It was a good time.

1914
01:38:38,680 --> 01:38:41,600
I called the witch doctor.

1915
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:42,880
It looked like, it looked interesting.

1916
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:47,160
I played the original Diablo and I had fun with that.

1917
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:48,400
I did not play any of the beta.

1918
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:55,880
I got invited to the beta for missile pandarian but I don't play wow so I have no interest

1919
01:38:55,880 --> 01:38:56,880
in that.

1920
01:38:56,880 --> 01:39:00,320
Everyone pretty much got invited in the last wave.

1921
01:39:00,320 --> 01:39:02,920
Rapid fire news, let's get to it Loki.

1922
01:39:02,920 --> 01:39:06,880
So this is interesting, Joyride is getting a sequel.

1923
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:07,880
Why?

1924
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:08,880
Why?

1925
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:09,880
I don't know.

1926
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:10,880
It wasn't a very fun game.

1927
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:14,320
It wasn't a very fun game but they're hoping to make it more fun by removing Kinect.

1928
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:16,560
Isn't that ironic?

1929
01:39:16,560 --> 01:39:21,760
So yes, Joyride, not Kinect Joyride anymore, will be getting a brand new title on Xbox

1930
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:22,860
Live Arcade.

1931
01:39:22,860 --> 01:39:28,800
It will be called Joyride Turbo and apparently it will have absolutely no Kinect support

1932
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:33,360
whatsoever and it's going to be just standard controller support which is fine if you think

1933
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:37,960
about it because originally it was supposed to be just a, you know, just an Xbox Live

1934
01:39:37,960 --> 01:39:42,120
Arcade title that was supposed to be free and then they were going to have a bunch of

1935
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:45,320
other crap that you could download and expand it with because it was going to be a free

1936
01:39:45,320 --> 01:39:46,320
to play type thing.

1937
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:50,120
They're going to have an all new stunt park and then I guess you can do different stunts

1938
01:39:50,120 --> 01:39:54,800
like jumping off cliffs and whatnot but that'll be coming out later on.

1939
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:58,840
Maybe if it's, you know, supposed to be in the summer or something, maybe a part of their

1940
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:03,480
summer thing that they're doing, I'm going to be willing to bet.

1941
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:04,480
You know what?

1942
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:09,120
It sounds kind of interesting then if it is without, you know, Kinect because Kinect kind

1943
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:13,840
of hurt that game but it could have been fun.

1944
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:15,920
So I'd be willing to check out the demo at least.

1945
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:18,480
I'll check out the demo at least.

1946
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:19,480
So hmm.

1947
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:20,480
Alright.

1948
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:25,160
Now something I really could care less about or couldn't care less I guess, Pikmin 2 is

1949
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:29,120
getting its new play control game on the Wii this June.

1950
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:34,240
Now for those who may not remember, they did this thing called new play control way back

1951
01:40:34,240 --> 01:40:40,120
in 2009 where they were taking some of these old GameCube games and adding some Wii support

1952
01:40:40,120 --> 01:40:44,720
on top of them and that's about it and they had a couple games that came out and then

1953
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:50,520
they kind of stopped and this actually came out in Japan and Europe in 2009 but for whatever

1954
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:55,120
reason they decided, hey, we're going to bring it out in the US now.

1955
01:40:55,120 --> 01:40:58,360
Thanks Nintendo for bringing this to us.

1956
01:40:58,360 --> 01:41:03,880
So the Wii could have a game although it isn't, what the hell is the name of that game?

1957
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:04,880
The big?

1958
01:41:04,880 --> 01:41:05,880
Why?

1959
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:06,880
It's escaping me.

1960
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:09,320
The last story is coming out, yes.

1961
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:11,760
I was going to say Litterbox Chronicles.

1962
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:16,560
The last story is coming out in June but honestly they haven't had a first party Wii title since,

1963
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:19,920
well, then Mario Party 9 had been the last first party Wii title and that was in the

1964
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:22,440
beginning of March.

1965
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:26,480
I mean they have an intended, they have the Pokemon Conquest game which you know, the

1966
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:28,640
Ice D-Wares cross Pokemon.

1967
01:41:28,640 --> 01:41:31,960
Hey, I'm, I'm curious.

1968
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:32,960
Let's just put it that.

1969
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:33,960
I'm curious.

1970
01:41:33,960 --> 01:41:41,120
Um, I just think it's kind of like, here, here you go, this is something that you really

1971
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:42,120
wanted.

1972
01:41:42,120 --> 01:41:45,600
So, so we're going to like, what is it, we're going to get the, fuck, I don't even remember

1973
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:49,600
the other games that have been released in other territories but not, are we going to

1974
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:51,920
get Captain Rainbow at some point, you know?

1975
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:53,960
Are they going to like localize that?

1976
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:58,120
What the hell is Captain Rainbow?

1977
01:41:58,120 --> 01:42:05,680
It was a game that came out in Japan that was, um, it was all these like old, uh.

1978
01:42:05,680 --> 01:42:10,440
What was the one with all the sexy men dudes that was like hole in the wall basically?

1979
01:42:10,440 --> 01:42:11,440
No, no.

1980
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:12,440
That did come out here, didn't it?

1981
01:42:12,440 --> 01:42:13,440
That did come out here.

1982
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:15,240
Yes, that came out here but Captain Rainbow did not.

1983
01:42:15,240 --> 01:42:19,120
Captain Rainbow was the one that had like all of the misfit Nintendo characters.

1984
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:24,320
Like Birdo was in it and stuff like that and it was just ridiculous.

1985
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:29,960
I want that, there's Birdo right there.

1986
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:36,400
What are you playing as?

1987
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:38,400
Captain Rainbow, dummy.

1988
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:39,960
Shut up.

1989
01:42:39,960 --> 01:42:45,480
It's like just this panned out thing, I was like, he's Falcon Punching.

1990
01:42:45,480 --> 01:42:50,920
His eyes are big flames.

1991
01:42:50,920 --> 01:42:56,160
He's doing rainbow things to that door.

1992
01:42:56,160 --> 01:42:58,680
Maybe they just think we wouldn't get it.

1993
01:42:58,680 --> 01:43:00,200
I play it.

1994
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:07,560
Exactly, it's really weird but um, there was another game though that was, um, and I don't

1995
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:10,320
remember for the life of me what the hell it was called.

1996
01:43:10,320 --> 01:43:14,120
It was like Disaster Day in Crisis or something like that, I think.

1997
01:43:14,120 --> 01:43:15,640
You know what else we don't have here?

1998
01:43:15,640 --> 01:43:17,720
Tingle's Adventure or whatever that game was.

1999
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:19,720
Yeah, it's because it sucked.

2000
01:43:19,720 --> 01:43:23,880
I'm sorry, no Tingle game here.

2001
01:43:23,880 --> 01:43:28,840
That's the new franchise Nintendo needs to explore, Tingle.

2002
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:30,240
Listen, no they don't.

2003
01:43:30,240 --> 01:43:32,280
He is a really fucking annoying character.

2004
01:43:32,280 --> 01:43:36,960
We do not need to bring this crap back up.

2005
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:40,160
Tingle's Epic Quest.

2006
01:43:40,160 --> 01:43:41,640
I would, Epic Tingle.

2007
01:43:41,640 --> 01:43:42,720
I will tell you what.

2008
01:43:42,720 --> 01:43:45,560
You know what, I think Epic Tingle would be a better game.

2009
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:49,880
If they launch the Wii U at the Tingle game, I will buy that system.

2010
01:43:49,880 --> 01:43:54,000
I thought you were going to say you'd dress up finally, the bet we've been trying to get

2011
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,000
forever.

2012
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,640
You know that would actually be like the easiest costume ever because all you'd have to do

2013
01:43:57,640 --> 01:43:59,120
is like sweat in a hoodie.

2014
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:00,120
Alright.

2015
01:44:00,120 --> 01:44:03,600
Moving on, do you have any other rapid fire news or is that it?

2016
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:04,600
That was it.

2017
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:08,680
No, no, I got one more and that's a little bit better and I'm sure this is gonna, this

2018
01:44:08,680 --> 01:44:10,960
may actually sell some vidas for some people.

2019
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:17,600
DGMax Technica Tune is actually coming out to the North America region for the Vita this

2020
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:22,840
summer and will also, I guess, you know, it looks pretty awesome.

2021
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:25,920
It looks just like the arcade stuff.

2022
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:28,280
Alright.

2023
01:44:28,280 --> 01:44:30,760
I'm very interested in DGMax Technica for the Vita actually.

2024
01:44:30,760 --> 01:44:34,640
I think it'll be very fun and I'm sure some of our music game fans in the chat room are

2025
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:36,400
very much looking forward to this as well.

2026
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:39,120
So I mean, that is, that was kind of cool.

2027
01:44:39,120 --> 01:44:41,600
Alright, let's move on to some other quick stories here.

2028
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:45,520
First one about THQ, who's been having some financial issues lately, even though things

2029
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:51,160
seem to be getting a little better, but one part is going away and that is ValueSoft.

2030
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:53,200
You may not know what ValueSoft is.

2031
01:44:53,200 --> 01:44:54,600
I'm well aware of ValueSoft.

2032
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:56,840
No, they make budget PC games.

2033
01:44:56,840 --> 01:44:59,280
So like when you see the little budget Wii games too.

2034
01:44:59,280 --> 01:45:05,080
$10 rack at Target of PC games and all that, it's, these games are in there.

2035
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:07,720
I want to see they run by Activision at one time.

2036
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:12,240
Maybe, but they're not going to be run by THQ anymore because they just sold it off.

2037
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:17,320
Apparently they are the second largest US retail publisher of PC games in terms of units

2038
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:18,320
sold.

2039
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:19,320
I had no idea.

2040
01:45:19,320 --> 01:45:25,840
But anyhow, I guess what is happening, oh no, I'm sorry, Cosme is buying them and together

2041
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:29,540
it will make them the second largest US retail publisher.

2042
01:45:29,540 --> 01:45:30,540
So I see where it is.

2043
01:45:30,540 --> 01:45:34,520
So ValueSoft was, wasn't, but now they will be with Cosme who they've sold it to.

2044
01:45:34,520 --> 01:45:37,680
To be fair, they do have their purpose in the industry.

2045
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:40,800
It's like, you know, seriously, if you're having a game that you're putting out that

2046
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:45,240
maybe is not that great and not necessarily that's not that great, but, um, at least there's

2047
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:49,680
a publisher out there for your independent game if you really want to.

2048
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:53,600
So if OLR the game ever becomes a reality, maybe on ValueSoft, right?

2049
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:58,560
Yeah, yeah, digital is probably the better way to go.

2050
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:03,000
So heads up to those folks that play games like City of Heroes, Champions Online and

2051
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:08,800
Star Trek Online, which would be Dark Sakura, Cryptic Studios found out that their systems

2052
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:10,560
have been hacked.

2053
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:11,720
That's right.

2054
01:46:11,720 --> 01:46:18,840
They were hacked in December of 2010, about a year and a half ago, 16 months old when

2055
01:46:18,840 --> 01:46:22,640
this hacking issue went on and it was just discovered this week and an email went out

2056
01:46:22,640 --> 01:46:25,960
to everybody saying basically, LOL, we changed the passwords.

2057
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:28,320
How did Cryptic find this 16 months later?

2058
01:46:28,320 --> 01:46:30,480
Through routine security checks and upgrades.

2059
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:32,800
Of course, I'm thinking that's not very routine.

2060
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:37,000
Is that the 16 month routine checkup?

2061
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,040
Once every two years.

2062
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:43,080
Account information, including passwords may have been accessed by an unauthorized party.

2063
01:46:43,080 --> 01:46:45,780
Of course, by now you probably would have had your account hacked.

2064
01:46:45,780 --> 01:46:47,440
Maybe that's how they got into the Xboxes.

2065
01:46:47,440 --> 01:46:49,040
No crap happened to my account.

2066
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:54,120
Just letting people know I logged, I logged in and nothing, everything was still there.

2067
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:55,320
So man, those hackers are good.

2068
01:46:55,320 --> 01:46:57,080
They turned Star Trek to free to play.

2069
01:46:57,080 --> 01:46:59,460
So I mean, they're pretty good.

2070
01:46:59,460 --> 01:47:01,560
So I spent an hour playing Dabo.

2071
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:06,720
Yet another great tip to change your passwords and use unique passwords on every site.

2072
01:47:06,720 --> 01:47:13,960
And it says that your network provider checks their security logs more than once every 16

2073
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:14,960
months.

2074
01:47:14,960 --> 01:47:15,960
All right.

2075
01:47:15,960 --> 01:47:20,640
And last but not least for my rapid fire news, Adam Sesser left G4.

2076
01:47:20,640 --> 01:47:23,360
Good for him.

2077
01:47:23,360 --> 01:47:24,360
You know what?

2078
01:47:24,360 --> 01:47:29,080
Hey, I understand you may joke, but you know what?

2079
01:47:29,080 --> 01:47:34,560
That guy, sadly, he was one of the good things from G4, not even G4, well, one of the good

2080
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:41,320
things left on G4 and one of the good things from Tech TV back when they're around.

2081
01:47:41,320 --> 01:47:46,320
And you know, Bravo to him actually moving on to probably some better waters.

2082
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:51,320
I mean, I don't know why the game blogs feel the need to continually cover G4.

2083
01:47:51,320 --> 01:47:54,600
G4 is not a gaming network and hasn't been for some time.

2084
01:47:54,600 --> 01:47:55,600
They're covering G4.

2085
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:56,600
I think they're talking about Adam Sessler.

2086
01:47:56,600 --> 01:48:01,360
I don't think they care if a rat's ass about G4, I think they care about Adam Sessler.

2087
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:06,720
I think that people are also curious- There's one response for that, Rob.

2088
01:48:06,720 --> 01:48:08,720
Did you kill a fly?

2089
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:14,040
I think people maybe are hoping that he's going somewhere that will actually be gaming

2090
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:18,240
related, but it is important to say, apparently it was a contract dispute that got him out

2091
01:48:18,240 --> 01:48:23,760
and you know, Comcast who owns G4, I'm sure wants to save money anywhere they can and

2092
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:29,600
probably doesn't throw a lot of money at a network that some, you know, like didn't

2093
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:32,200
DirecTV threaten to pull the plug on G4?

2094
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:33,200
Maybe they already did?

2095
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:37,440
Listen, we have enough cheater and cops reruns, we don't need you guys around here.

2096
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:43,620
Honestly, G4 to me seems like a network that'd be better suited for the internet.

2097
01:48:43,620 --> 01:48:44,620
You know what I mean?

2098
01:48:44,620 --> 01:48:49,480
Just having like digital content on the internet because they don't have much content to begin

2099
01:48:49,480 --> 01:48:50,480
with.

2100
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:53,440
It's literally cops and cheaters reruns all the fucking time.

2101
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:56,480
The internet doesn't need them now, they have us.

2102
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:59,520
And in fact, there's several folks in the chat room that say, Sessler should come to

2103
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:00,520
vlog.

2104
01:49:00,520 --> 01:49:02,680
I, he is, the door is open.

2105
01:49:02,680 --> 01:49:04,640
I will, I would love to interview Adam Sessler.

2106
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:05,640
We can't pay you though.

2107
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:07,280
We'll pay him in Starbucks.

2108
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:08,280
Exactly.

2109
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:13,560
He will probably be getting less money than you were beginning with G4.

2110
01:49:13,560 --> 01:49:15,200
Some folks seem to think he could go to Polygon.

2111
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:19,480
Again, this is all rampant speculation because you know, he just, I don't think he was planning

2112
01:49:19,480 --> 01:49:20,480
on leaving.

2113
01:49:20,480 --> 01:49:23,160
He thought the contracts would go through, but they didn't.

2114
01:49:23,160 --> 01:49:28,280
Polygon of course is that whole kind of Voltron of the guy who used to be the editor in Chiba

2115
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:33,640
Kotaku and the like three editor guys from Joystiq and a bunch of people all coming together

2116
01:49:33,640 --> 01:49:34,640
for that one.

2117
01:49:34,640 --> 01:49:35,640
So.

2118
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:36,640
Hmm.

2119
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:43,880
Anyhow, uh, he's gone and G4 takes one more step away from gaming.

2120
01:49:43,880 --> 01:49:44,880
Moving on.

2121
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:45,880
Dark Soccer.

2122
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:48,900
Vel, moving, no we won't pay him in Pinkberry.

2123
01:49:48,900 --> 01:49:49,900
That Pinkberry's for us.

2124
01:49:49,900 --> 01:49:50,900
That's right.

2125
01:49:50,900 --> 01:49:51,900
I'm not giving up my Pinkberry.

2126
01:49:51,900 --> 01:49:52,900
Hell no.

2127
01:49:52,900 --> 01:49:53,900
I'm giving up my portion of Pinkberry.

2128
01:49:53,900 --> 01:49:54,900
You know what?

2129
01:49:54,900 --> 01:49:55,900
He can have the Peach Pinkberry.

2130
01:49:55,900 --> 01:49:59,720
He can have the Peach, all the Peach, and the Lychee shit when it comes back.

2131
01:49:59,720 --> 01:50:00,720
Oh yeah.

2132
01:50:00,720 --> 01:50:02,400
You can have the Lychee too.

2133
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:08,860
So the Perpetual Testing Initiative DLC for Portal 2 will be available for PC and Mac

2134
01:50:08,860 --> 01:50:15,080
on May 8th and I'm downloading the shit out of it, but there's nothing saying about it

2135
01:50:15,080 --> 01:50:17,600
being on any of the consoles.

2136
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:18,600
I second that.

2137
01:50:18,600 --> 01:50:24,720
I mean, I haven't redeemed my copy of Portal 2 for the PC on, um, my Steam thing that came

2138
01:50:24,720 --> 01:50:25,720
with the PS3.

2139
01:50:25,720 --> 01:50:28,520
You know, it might've had an expiration date, so you might want to look into that.

2140
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:29,520
Damn it.

2141
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:30,520
You better be careful.

2142
01:50:30,520 --> 01:50:31,520
Whatever.

2143
01:50:31,520 --> 01:50:32,520
Um.

2144
01:50:32,520 --> 01:50:33,840
It's like super cheap anyway now.

2145
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:34,840
Yeah.

2146
01:50:34,840 --> 01:50:40,580
But I'm totally going to be writing a review on that when I download it because, you know,

2147
01:50:40,580 --> 01:50:43,880
my favorite thing to do in Sims, in Sims 3 was build houses.

2148
01:50:43,880 --> 01:50:47,920
Now I'll be building tests.

2149
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:49,720
Would you like to play a game?

2150
01:50:49,720 --> 01:50:50,920
Oh God.

2151
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:56,160
So, uh, for Dragon Quest fans, Dragon Quest X, um, which is the Wii...

2152
01:50:56,160 --> 01:50:57,160
Sorry.

2153
01:50:57,160 --> 01:51:00,520
I'm just imagining your dream OLR Studios level.

2154
01:51:00,520 --> 01:51:03,800
With Loki and I in a perpetual fall.

2155
01:51:03,800 --> 01:51:04,800
Oh my God.

2156
01:51:04,800 --> 01:51:07,800
You guys would be the perfect Atlas and Peabody.

2157
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:09,160
That should be your cosplay as Atlas and Peabody.

2158
01:51:09,160 --> 01:51:12,760
I know who's Atlas.

2159
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:14,040
Moving on.

2160
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:21,640
So anyway, um, for Dragon Quest fans, Dragon Quest X, um, which is, uh, the MMO, uh, launching

2161
01:51:21,640 --> 01:51:26,420
in Japan on August 2nd, Squeenix has told everybody.

2162
01:51:26,420 --> 01:51:34,040
It will be for the actual disc is, um, 6980 yen, which is about 86 bucks and it's 20 days

2163
01:51:34,040 --> 01:51:35,120
of free play.

2164
01:51:35,120 --> 01:51:41,160
It will include a USB memory stick for an extra, uh, 2000 yen and, uh, like 23 bucks

2165
01:51:41,160 --> 01:51:42,160
here.

2166
01:51:42,160 --> 01:51:46,840
And, uh, there is going to be a Wii U version, but they have no details on this one.

2167
01:51:46,840 --> 01:51:53,820
The subscription fee is a thousand yen, basically a 1235 in US dollars.

2168
01:51:53,820 --> 01:51:57,400
And that's a 30 day voucher that gives you to play up to three characters.

2169
01:51:57,400 --> 01:52:00,880
Sixty days is 1950, 90 days will be 2,900.

2170
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:06,480
So somebody was just asking the other day to square a while subscription is square.

2171
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:10,640
Square Enix had any other MMOs and I forgot about this one, but yeah, Dragon Quest 10,

2172
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:11,640
no news about it over here.

2173
01:52:11,640 --> 01:52:14,680
Maybe this is probably an E3 thing.

2174
01:52:14,680 --> 01:52:15,680
I don't know the American version.

2175
01:52:15,680 --> 01:52:19,600
I don't think the launch, you know, Dragon Quest is still a big thing here.

2176
01:52:19,600 --> 01:52:21,160
I understand it is in Japan.

2177
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:24,800
It would be a big thing for launch, but I don't think it is not above square to talk

2178
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:27,460
about games that are coming out three years from now at E3.

2179
01:52:27,460 --> 01:52:28,960
That is very true.

2180
01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:32,240
So Final Fantasy 13 versus, yes, yes, exactly.

2181
01:52:32,240 --> 01:52:36,860
I get to, Oh God, I hope, I hope versus makes the holiday this year.

2182
01:52:36,860 --> 01:52:39,680
I really want zero to come out over here.

2183
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:40,680
Oh yeah.

2184
01:52:40,680 --> 01:52:43,080
Cause I want to play the hell out of that.

2185
01:52:43,080 --> 01:52:50,480
So how about my last bit for rapid fire news, Silent Hill Downpour.

2186
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:56,500
There actually is a patch, there's two patch announcements, one for Silent Hill Downpour

2187
01:52:56,500 --> 01:53:01,040
and then we have Silent Hill HD Collection to fix the frame rate problems and audio syncing

2188
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:06,860
and downpour and the auto save in the Silent Hill HD Collection and they should be coming

2189
01:53:06,860 --> 01:53:15,040
out and the quote is in the coming weeks, but, uh, there's no patch yet to make a Silent

2190
01:53:15,040 --> 01:53:16,040
Hill HD Collection.

2191
01:53:16,040 --> 01:53:17,040
Good.

2192
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:18,040
Yeah.

2193
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:21,360
We should spend a little bit more time on figuring out how fog works.

2194
01:53:21,360 --> 01:53:25,000
Fog is hard.

2195
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:28,400
It's just like, come on Silent Hill.

2196
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:30,320
Oh, the monsters don't work.

2197
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:32,560
Well, let's just release it anyways.

2198
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:35,960
I mean, that's about as integral as the fog.

2199
01:53:35,960 --> 01:53:38,000
The fog is kind of important there.

2200
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,960
All right, let's go to the FUGL question of the week.

2201
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:43,560
We've kind of missed this the past couple of weeks, so I think it's time we get to the

2202
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:44,560
FUGL question.

2203
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:45,720
I haven't missed it at all.

2204
01:53:45,720 --> 01:53:46,720
Why haven't you missed?

2205
01:53:46,720 --> 01:53:47,720
Are you, are you hating on the FUGL?

2206
01:53:47,720 --> 01:53:48,720
No.

2207
01:53:48,720 --> 01:53:49,720
I'm being a bitch.

2208
01:53:49,720 --> 01:53:53,320
Except, oops, I didn't have the FUGL theme song up tonight.

2209
01:53:53,320 --> 01:53:54,320
Shame on me.

2210
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:55,320
Fail fired.

2211
01:53:55,320 --> 01:53:58,320
We're hiring Adam Sessler Robbed.

2212
01:53:58,320 --> 01:53:59,320
You guys would fire.

2213
01:53:59,320 --> 01:54:01,960
Exclusive Adam Sessler to replace Rob.

2214
01:54:01,960 --> 01:54:02,960
Here it is.

2215
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:03,960
There it is.

2216
01:54:03,960 --> 01:54:04,960
FUGL.

2217
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:09,280
Every week on our Facebook community and our Google Plus community, we ask a question and

2218
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:10,280
get your answers.

2219
01:54:10,280 --> 01:54:12,400
Combine Facebook and Google and you get FUGL.

2220
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:14,780
That's why it's our FUGL question of the week.

2221
01:54:14,780 --> 01:54:19,120
Now that Sony has announced their own Smash Brothers style game, should Microsoft start

2222
01:54:19,120 --> 01:54:20,560
working on one?

2223
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:24,080
Why or why or why not wouldn't this be a good idea?

2224
01:54:24,080 --> 01:54:26,800
If you think it's a good idea, what character would you most want to see in the game?

2225
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:30,320
We got one answer on Google Plus, so there are people using Google Plus.

2226
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:34,440
Danny Kaye says, I don't really think they have enough first party games to justify a

2227
01:54:34,440 --> 01:54:35,440
game like that.

2228
01:54:35,440 --> 01:54:36,440
Ah, exactly.

2229
01:54:36,440 --> 01:54:39,400
That's a theme we're seeing quite a bit through some of the answers going over to Facebook

2230
01:54:39,400 --> 01:54:44,320
where we had lots of answers and I love this one from Bobby Blackwolf who posted a link

2231
01:54:44,320 --> 01:54:50,440
to a picture on a NeoGaf forum of what an Xbox Super Smash Brothers game would look

2232
01:54:50,440 --> 01:54:59,960
like and it's just a select screen for Xbox 360 Ultra Heroes Ultimate Fight and it's 15

2233
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:05,680
different versions of Master Chief, all in different colors and shapes on the select

2234
01:55:05,680 --> 01:55:06,920
screen.

2235
01:55:06,920 --> 01:55:13,920
You know what this is missing though is the female Master Chief with a bow in her hair.

2236
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:17,920
Mrs. Chief.

2237
01:55:17,920 --> 01:55:22,120
Katsuhiko Janai says, I don't want to play as Microsoft Bob or Clippy.

2238
01:55:22,120 --> 01:55:26,440
See, I like thinking, think outside the box, don't just make it the video games, make it

2239
01:55:26,440 --> 01:55:27,440
all the...

2240
01:55:27,440 --> 01:55:28,440
Clippy would be awesome.

2241
01:55:28,440 --> 01:55:31,680
I'm not thinking outside the Xbox.

2242
01:55:31,680 --> 01:55:34,560
Getting to kick the shit out of Clippy I think would sell...

2243
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:37,360
Or the damn dog.

2244
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:38,720
That ugly ass dog.

2245
01:55:38,720 --> 01:55:43,680
You know what character needs to be in the game Rob, seriously, Comic Sans so I can beat

2246
01:55:43,680 --> 01:55:44,680
the shit out of it.

2247
01:55:44,680 --> 01:55:45,680
All right.

2248
01:55:45,680 --> 01:55:49,600
Stan H says, I agree with Blackwolf, Microsoft doesn't have enough first party characters

2249
01:55:49,600 --> 01:55:52,080
to fill a decent sized roster for today's fighting game.

2250
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:56,320
You need to have at least 15 and I can't think of anyone besides Master Chief and Milo unless

2251
01:55:56,320 --> 01:56:01,320
they have a Kinect that has legs and arms with boxing gloves on.

2252
01:56:01,320 --> 01:56:03,720
I know, that was funny.

2253
01:56:03,720 --> 01:56:08,880
James A says though, I must confess, I'd love to see Joanna Dark in such a game.

2254
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:09,880
Cameo too.

2255
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:11,720
So some folks are starting to think of some others.

2256
01:56:11,720 --> 01:56:16,320
Red the Haze says, no, even though Microsoft has a far more popular titles with characters

2257
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:20,040
like Master Chief, they just don't have as much of a history to draw from like Sony or

2258
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:23,240
Nintendo since they're relatively new to the console gaming business.

2259
01:56:23,240 --> 01:56:27,360
They have a few recognizable characters to choose from, they have Master Chief, Fable

2260
01:56:27,360 --> 01:56:30,080
Dude, Gears of War characters.

2261
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:34,680
Another thing, most of the popular characters on the Xbox are from shooter games, throwing

2262
01:56:34,680 --> 01:56:38,200
characters from shooter games into a Smash Brothers type fighting might not go so well

2263
01:56:38,200 --> 01:56:42,280
with the Dude Bro gamers who are primarily in the Xbox shooters.

2264
01:56:42,280 --> 01:56:45,680
Though if they ever made one, I would love to see the President and Vice President from

2265
01:56:45,680 --> 01:56:48,960
Metal Wolf Chaos, that would totally change my mind.

2266
01:56:48,960 --> 01:56:53,760
Now I like what Jim H. said, they really, even if they don't, even if they can muster

2267
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:56,400
up a roster, they really don't make those kinds of games.

2268
01:56:56,400 --> 01:57:03,360
Maybe an all-star shooter, so like an all-star melee rampage in first person.

2269
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:09,680
Just call it like a Microsoft capture the flag, I don't know.

2270
01:57:09,680 --> 01:57:10,680
There you go.

2271
01:57:10,680 --> 01:57:12,820
Uh, let's see.

2272
01:57:12,820 --> 01:57:15,440
Now Gio Video goes a different way with this.

2273
01:57:15,440 --> 01:57:19,800
Well considering Nintendo was able to use Sonic and Snake, it doesn't have to be characters

2274
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:23,280
exclusive to Microsoft, just characters they're willing to pay money for.

2275
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:28,560
And since there are games like Metal Gear, Final Fantasy 13, Devil May Cry, that have

2276
01:57:28,560 --> 01:57:32,040
come into the Microsoft franchise, I can see them paying for the use of those characters

2277
01:57:32,040 --> 01:57:34,400
as well as Microsoft exclusives.

2278
01:57:34,400 --> 01:57:38,240
Also since it's Microsoft, perhaps a paper clip that fights with well-placed sarcastic

2279
01:57:38,240 --> 01:57:40,120
comments and uses itself like a sword.

2280
01:57:40,120 --> 01:57:44,920
You're also forgetting the fact that there's Xbox Live Arcade, there's plenty of shit on

2281
01:57:44,920 --> 01:57:45,920
Xbox Live Arcade.

2282
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:46,920
That's true.

2283
01:57:46,920 --> 01:57:52,040
You can do Castle Crashers, you can have, you know, um, what was it, uh...

2284
01:57:52,040 --> 01:57:53,040
You know what's funny?

2285
01:57:53,040 --> 01:57:54,200
Tony B. said that.

2286
01:57:54,200 --> 01:57:59,560
Xbox Arcade characters swap out Master Chief for Bastion, Tim from Brave, Knights from Castle

2287
01:57:59,560 --> 01:58:04,240
Crashers, dude from Plants from Zombies, Splosion Man.

2288
01:58:04,240 --> 01:58:05,360
So there you go.

2289
01:58:05,360 --> 01:58:10,360
Uh, Orangewrite says Microsoft owns Rare, Rare has the Battletoads.

2290
01:58:10,360 --> 01:58:11,360
Think about it.

2291
01:58:11,360 --> 01:58:14,520
President Cat would not work by the way, Tigerclaw, because that...

2292
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:16,720
Didn't Rare also do Killer Instinct?

2293
01:58:16,720 --> 01:58:17,720
Yes.

2294
01:58:17,720 --> 01:58:19,400
Oh, but Nintendo technically owns that.

2295
01:58:19,400 --> 01:58:21,960
I don't care, let's do a new Battletoads game.

2296
01:58:21,960 --> 01:58:24,400
Fuck any of this other shit, who gives a crap about this?

2297
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:26,440
Battletoads is the devil.

2298
01:58:26,440 --> 01:58:27,440
I don't care.

2299
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:29,040
That game's freaking hard.

2300
01:58:29,040 --> 01:58:32,240
Battletoads with like even more, more difficulty.

2301
01:58:32,240 --> 01:58:35,680
And then it had that like level music, the pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft

2302
01:58:35,680 --> 01:58:36,680
pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft

2303
01:58:36,680 --> 01:58:46,360
pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft

2304
01:58:46,360 --> 01:59:03,580
pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft p

2305
01:59:03,580 --> 01:59:07,640
twitter.com slash olr and Milo be terrible too because I have family

2306
01:59:07,640 --> 01:59:13,900
issues and I'm gonna shoot you in the face all right let's get back into some

2307
01:59:13,900 --> 01:59:21,880
other news Loki exclusive no I'm kidding so yes there there's a little bit of

2308
01:59:21,880 --> 01:59:26,980
talk about the next Smash Brothers game no we're not talking about PlayStation

2309
01:59:26,980 --> 01:59:33,160
one for the Wii U and the 3ds and one of the things that they're really pushing

2310
01:59:33,160 --> 01:59:39,040
for is cross support for those two platforms to be able to brawl against

2311
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:44,620
each other of course you know who wouldn't want to do that it says

2312
01:59:44,620 --> 01:59:48,940
there's a certain dead end we can we come to if we just expand the volume of

2313
01:59:48,940 --> 01:59:54,100
the game us of course I intend to change the direction a little bit as we go the

2314
01:59:54,100 --> 02:00:00,260
key is that there's going to be its dual support for 3ds and Wii U so they're

2315
02:00:00,260 --> 02:00:05,860
gonna have some sort of you know cross play between the platforms which really

2316
02:00:05,860 --> 02:00:10,780
in this day and age is not that big a deal I mean the PSP and PlayStation 3 do

2317
02:00:10,780 --> 02:00:18,620
that the Vita and the PlayStation 3 do that not a huge deal it depends on how

2318
02:00:18,620 --> 02:00:23,140
like you know well integrated it is to you know well you know with that Wii U

2319
02:00:23,140 --> 02:00:27,060
controller being the bottom half of a 3ds I'm pretty sure that they'll be able

2320
02:00:27,060 --> 02:00:31,620
to pull it off I'm still excited about the next Smash Brothers it's a good

2321
02:00:31,620 --> 02:00:35,940
franchise yeah it'll be great to launch the next 3ds or the revision of the 3ds

2322
02:00:35,940 --> 02:00:40,900
it'll probably announce it oh don't give them ideas you jerk ideas they already

2323
02:00:40,900 --> 02:00:46,800
have ideas well nobody could call this idea that's for damn sure this game is

2324
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:53,620
calling out idea either it's called NBA baller beats hey I thought you know

2325
02:00:53,620 --> 02:00:58,100
music game fans would enjoy this NBA baller beats it is being described as a

2326
02:00:58,100 --> 02:01:02,460
fun high-energy and first-of-its-kind participative the basketball video game

2327
02:01:02,460 --> 02:01:07,740
launching this fall exclusively on connect for the 360 you play this game

2328
02:01:07,740 --> 02:01:16,060
with an actual basketball in your living room it has licensed tracks from artists

2329
02:01:16,060 --> 02:01:19,860
like Kanye West run DMC gorillas hey there you go

2330
02:01:19,860 --> 02:01:25,620
common tiesto so and so much more apparently USA today got their hands on

2331
02:01:25,620 --> 02:01:29,660
the game and say it's a rhythm music game not like a dribbling coach like a

2332
02:01:29,660 --> 02:01:33,700
rhythm music game you bounce the ball to the beat of the music you have a visual

2333
02:01:33,700 --> 02:01:37,060
cue that's a line of basketballs on a musical trail and you have to do

2334
02:01:37,060 --> 02:01:40,620
specific moves like an icon might prepare you for an upcoming basketball

2335
02:01:40,620 --> 02:01:44,540
move also in time with the music you might have to cross over from one hand

2336
02:01:44,540 --> 02:01:50,980
to the other dribble between the legs do a pass fake or a shot fake it's creative

2337
02:01:50,980 --> 02:01:54,260
I got it to give it that but I'm like how in the fuck is this gonna work

2338
02:01:54,260 --> 02:01:57,860
because if you're playing it in your living room how do you bounce a ball on

2339
02:01:57,860 --> 02:02:02,060
your carpet I used to live in a house with hardwood floors but even then I

2340
02:02:02,060 --> 02:02:06,380
don't think my roommate would appreciate me playing this game well apparently

2341
02:02:06,380 --> 02:02:10,460
dribbling is going to be very close to the body because that's the way it is in

2342
02:02:10,460 --> 02:02:16,140
basketball they don't encourage you to dribble at the TV or whatever let's see

2343
02:02:16,140 --> 02:02:22,540
apparently it is possible to play baller beats in a carpeted room it will work

2344
02:02:22,540 --> 02:02:27,900
the ball will work on most services but that doesn't I guess shag rugs won't

2345
02:02:27,900 --> 02:02:31,060
work but the carpet should I don't know what the heck to take from that I feel

2346
02:02:31,060 --> 02:02:35,740
like I should say that's what she said but I I'm sorry it's just like this

2347
02:02:35,740 --> 02:02:41,180
sounds stupid I not that it's an I'll give them props to the fact that it's a

2348
02:02:41,180 --> 02:02:45,860
unique game idea now there's a little trailer here I've got it has been try

2349
02:02:45,860 --> 02:02:50,580
like this before but I think for good reason because it's stupid because it's

2350
02:02:50,580 --> 02:02:55,660
just I don't think this is gonna work well connect I think this is gonna be

2351
02:02:55,660 --> 02:02:59,320
annoying if you're in a goddamn apartment and also especially if you're

2352
02:02:59,320 --> 02:03:05,340
upstairs yes especially if you're upstairs and it's just I mean I was

2353
02:03:05,340 --> 02:03:08,980
looking in this trailer for clips of the game but I don't think I'm gonna see it

2354
02:03:08,980 --> 02:03:15,460
oh wait no there's a guy it's just him in the living room bouncing a ball but

2355
02:03:15,460 --> 02:03:18,900
he doesn't actually shoot the ball I mean you kind of care you fake shooting

2356
02:03:18,900 --> 02:03:23,220
it but which icons gonna indicate the you know me throwing the ball into the

2357
02:03:23,220 --> 02:03:28,580
TV because that's kind of you know a risk hopefully this thing is made out of

2358
02:03:28,580 --> 02:03:34,420
nerve because that's the only way you're gonna like not break your TV how many

2359
02:03:34,420 --> 02:03:44,580
lamps is this game gonna there's no in-game footage at all okay whatever I'm

2360
02:03:44,580 --> 02:03:49,060
sorry but like these games that come out for connect nobody can fucking take this

2361
02:03:49,060 --> 02:03:53,220
shit seriously they'd be honest Majesco hasn't really had a lot of games that

2362
02:03:53,220 --> 02:03:56,620
take the Kinect seriously I think the last game that they released for the

2363
02:03:56,620 --> 02:04:08,500
Kinect was the twister game twister for Kinect yeah no no this port this should

2364
02:04:08,500 --> 02:04:13,260
be an Xbox Live arcade game but it's not pork chocolate you can't get a little

2365
02:04:13,260 --> 02:04:18,460
nerfy ball from Xbox Live arcade nerfy derpy this will be on the aisle right

2366
02:04:18,460 --> 02:04:23,140
next to babysitting mama with the little wee baby that you shove the wiimote up

2367
02:04:23,140 --> 02:04:28,660
yet but that did well it's on sale at Target yeah it didn't cry pork chop and

2368
02:04:28,660 --> 02:04:31,780
chat says my ears are burning at the sound of this ass hattery and that's

2369
02:04:31,780 --> 02:04:35,420
pretty much what most people in the chat room boils down to you know I gotta

2370
02:04:35,420 --> 02:04:41,700
admit I as dumb as this sounds you guys I'm not gonna lie I kind of want to try

2371
02:04:41,700 --> 02:04:48,220
it just to say I did cuz it's not like any other Kinect game I've seen yet I

2372
02:04:48,220 --> 02:04:53,460
guess it's kind of a dance game at its core but if I could do the thing with

2373
02:04:53,460 --> 02:05:00,140
the ball like that guy hey I'd be fly I could get chicks Dark Sakura would buy

2374
02:05:00,140 --> 02:05:12,060
I'd be hot if I could dribble the ball you're becoming whiter knock it off all

2375
02:05:12,060 --> 02:05:16,060
right we're gonna go to the mailbag every week you guys send us emails they

2376
02:05:16,060 --> 02:05:20,580
don't and tell me about the things I shouldn't be doing no they don't mailbag

2377
02:05:20,580 --> 02:05:26,220
at orange lounge radio.com they really don't send anything we have one email

2378
02:05:26,220 --> 02:05:30,300
one email this week I guess everybody just just thought with the network

2379
02:05:30,300 --> 02:05:35,060
switch we wouldn't have time for emails I'm gonna hope that was it so this comes

2380
02:05:35,060 --> 02:05:38,620
from Robert M I was wondering whether Dark Sakura has had a chance to try the

2381
02:05:38,620 --> 02:05:43,460
pinball arcade either the is version or the latest console download although

2382
02:05:43,460 --> 02:05:46,980
video pinball simply can't really compete with the experience of real

2383
02:05:46,980 --> 02:05:51,100
physical tables what her overall impressions were actually I did download

2384
02:05:51,100 --> 02:05:54,540
it I haven't had a chance to play it yet I thought I talked about this on last

2385
02:05:54,540 --> 02:05:59,500
week or the week I have the iOS version yeah and I have I have literally not I

2386
02:05:59,500 --> 02:06:04,600
downloaded it that's it I played it on 360 it's um it's a faithful recreation

2387
02:06:04,600 --> 02:06:09,660
of the tables it's it really is just like the compilations they already put

2388
02:06:09,660 --> 02:06:12,460
out it's just this is kind of a different way of distributing it and I

2389
02:06:12,460 --> 02:06:15,940
think it's some different tables too I was thrilled to be able to play on

2390
02:06:15,940 --> 02:06:20,100
theater magic theater magic so one of the greatest tables ever I could try

2391
02:06:20,100 --> 02:06:23,380
loading it up so to be able to play that and Arabian Nights is that what the

2392
02:06:23,380 --> 02:06:29,100
table is actually called I have another name to it so I always remember this but

2393
02:06:29,100 --> 02:06:33,860
I love theater magic so to be able to play that again is great you know

2394
02:06:33,860 --> 02:06:37,100
there's things I like about pinball FX 2 and there's things I like about this

2395
02:06:37,100 --> 02:06:42,140
game certainly this game has the classic table feel to it and I get to play all

2396
02:06:42,140 --> 02:06:46,540
those old tables and kind of reminisce but I like that pinball FX has you know

2397
02:06:46,540 --> 02:06:51,540
Arabian tales of the Arabian Nights okay good Ripley's believe it or not black

2398
02:06:51,540 --> 02:06:56,460
hole I love black hole theater of magic bride of pin bot you know I used to have

02:07:46,340 --> 02:07:49,780

during the wedding of a local weather reporter that's it oh I'm so glad we

2425
02:09:24,140 --> 02:09:29,700
pack up all my shit at my desk into a box let some other mover take it because

2426
02:09:29,700 --> 02:09:36,100

2429
02:09:47,140 --> 02:09:53,660

2432
02:10:01,180 --> 02:10:08,820
right moving on let's get some more news Loki so this is kind of interesting it

2433
02:10:08,820 --> 02:10:15,620
leaked out on the PlayStation Network Store one of the PlayStation 1 classics

2434
02:10:15,620 --> 02:10:21,220
for the Vita it was actually in the European store Buzz Lightyear of Star

2435
02:10:21,220 --> 02:10:30,180
Command was the game it's been pulled so far but however it doesn't work yet it's

2436
02:10:30,180 --> 02:10:35,420
it's like it's missing a patch or something like that but apparently that

2437
02:10:35,420 --> 02:10:40,020
is a very good indicator that they're gonna be having some PlayStation 1 games

2438
02:10:40,020 --> 02:10:43,900
available very soon for the PlayStation Vita thank God I hope they all are

2439
02:10:43,900 --> 02:10:47,740
because that would be that would be a great library to just open my Vita to

2440
02:10:47,740 --> 02:10:51,900
you know Final Fantasy 7 hello yeah what else do I want Castlevania and now you're

2441
02:10:51,900 --> 02:10:55,300
getting some of these through ps2 Silent Hill the original yeah is free right

2442
02:10:55,300 --> 02:10:59,540
now on PlayStation Plus hopefully the plus stuff works on the Vita maybe they

2443
02:10:59,540 --> 02:11:02,580
have to get all that worked out I don't know but yeah I'm looking forward to

2444
02:11:02,580 --> 02:11:07,020
that that's gonna I know it sounds really weird that like you know it's

2445
02:11:07,020 --> 02:11:11,620
like oh I'm excited about old ass 15 year old games on my portable console

2446
02:11:11,620 --> 02:11:16,620
but you know I don't know I just there's a lot of stuff I have now that I didn't

2447
02:11:16,620 --> 02:11:21,340
when my PSP was all the rage and those screens are so big and crystal clear

2448
02:11:21,340 --> 02:11:26,020
like I'm it's most likely something they'll announce at e3 I think I gotta

2449
02:11:26,020 --> 02:11:31,180
wait that long and let I will only accept that if it's a one of those well

2450
02:11:31,180 --> 02:11:36,660
we're gonna be patching the PlayStation 1 titles into the Vita today you know

2451
02:11:36,660 --> 02:11:40,900
how sometimes there's that whole today announcement like what did Microsoft

2452
02:11:40,900 --> 02:11:48,460
have googly eyes on the Kinect today connect that was a googly eyes laser

2453
02:11:48,460 --> 02:11:56,020
pointer you know I liked it better some of that stuff was cute no no I liked it

2454
02:11:56,020 --> 02:12:00,940
better was that the second year we went to e3 2006 mm-hmm and they fucking had

2455
02:12:00,940 --> 02:12:05,020
hey listen you know what I know a lot of you people can't go to e3 so we're gonna

2456
02:12:05,020 --> 02:12:09,340
put some of those demos that are at e3 on your console that was fucking that

2457
02:12:09,340 --> 02:12:13,500
great that was great but they don't do that shit anymore they never do that

2458
02:12:13,500 --> 02:12:17,420
anymore it was like lost planet and I'd play this shit out of that demo over and

2459
02:12:17,420 --> 02:12:21,540
over again and MotoGP but I didn't give a shit about that but at least Capcom

2460
02:12:21,540 --> 02:12:26,820
got it once you know there I mean they should really do that again or as orange

2461
02:12:26,820 --> 02:12:31,020
right in the chat room says Saturn is coming out today things were different

2462
02:12:31,020 --> 02:12:34,460
back then though when the Saturn came out technology wasn't the way it is now

2463
02:12:34,460 --> 02:12:37,860
like I think if they were to do a system launch like that it would be a lot

2464
02:12:37,860 --> 02:12:42,500
different or at least like you know maybe not today but like it's coming out

2465
02:12:42,500 --> 02:12:49,540
next Friday that's like Apple yeah Apple does that works for them all right

2466
02:12:49,540 --> 02:12:53,340
anyhow uh well you just talked about one thing Capcom does right let me tell you

2467
02:12:53,340 --> 02:12:58,980
about something Capcom does very wrong oh that's a long the Megaman franchise

2468
02:12:58,980 --> 02:13:04,060
it is of note and I wanted to bring it up here on the show that the 100,000

2469
02:13:04,060 --> 02:13:09,820
strong for bringing back Megaman Legends 3 actually hit a hundred thousand

2470
02:13:09,820 --> 02:13:15,580
members this week I'm one of them yeah I think I am too so there you go and this

2471
02:13:15,580 --> 02:13:19,860
that is something that the million moms couldn't accomplish the 1 million moms

2472
02:13:19,860 --> 02:13:25,540
against Ellen or whatever dumbass hattery that stuff was so the hundred

2473
02:13:25,540 --> 02:13:29,940
thousand strong for Megaman Legends I liked they set a reasonable goal they

2474
02:13:29,940 --> 02:13:35,260
didn't say millions for a Megaman Legends they said a hundred thousand

2475
02:13:35,260 --> 02:13:37,820
strong for Megaman Legends because getting a million people in your

2476
02:13:37,820 --> 02:13:41,140
Facebook group that's reserved for things like Betty White hosting Saturday

2477
02:13:41,140 --> 02:13:44,460
Night Live and things like that that's you got to get one of those to get a

2478
02:13:44,460 --> 02:13:49,420
million a hundred thousand though is no small feat that's that's great

2479
02:13:49,420 --> 02:13:52,820
hundred thousand strong so important that if you are a member of the group

2480
02:13:52,820 --> 02:13:57,480
and you have not joined the dev room community at part of Capcom mm-hmm make

2481
02:13:57,480 --> 02:14:00,500
sure you do that because that's what Capcom is actually looking at assuming

2482
02:14:00,500 --> 02:14:03,980
that they're actually looking at something maybe this is gonna pressure

2483
02:14:03,980 --> 02:14:10,580
Capcom into an announcement this e3 we'll see well you fans you demanded it

2484
02:14:10,580 --> 02:14:14,500
so we're gonna finally port those games over that we've been promising oh I'm

2485
02:14:14,500 --> 02:14:19,580
sorry that's into Rama in our chat room says sky I know people on that group

2486
02:14:19,580 --> 02:14:24,380
they fucking occupied the Capcom booth at comic-con as hilarious as that

2487
02:14:24,380 --> 02:14:29,220
imagery is that's kind of messed up because the people at the booze manning

2488
02:14:29,220 --> 02:14:32,900
the floor especially at an event like comic-con probably aren't really the

2489
02:14:32,900 --> 02:14:36,940
decision-makers like yeah but the word will get back I guess that's true but I

2490
02:14:36,940 --> 02:14:40,380
don't know if that's exactly the best way to go about doing it to make a scene

2491
02:14:40,380 --> 02:14:47,580
like that but whatever different strokes for different folks I wonder if now

2492
02:14:47,580 --> 02:14:52,160
they're gonna release it and be all like because the fans demanded it this is the

2493
02:14:52,160 --> 02:14:57,980
fan game shit it worked for operation rainfall I go back go back two years ago

2494
02:14:57,980 --> 02:15:00,580
on this show and that whole operation rainfall thing first started we all sat

2495
02:15:00,580 --> 02:15:04,780
here saying hey chance in hell that's gonna work sorry guys look at what

2496
02:15:04,780 --> 02:15:10,220
happened earthbound yet it works we're having to eat our work it worked or game

2497
02:15:10,220 --> 02:15:13,020
stuff decided hey we're in a back well need to bring it over here and then

2498
02:15:13,020 --> 02:15:16,540
another publisher let's say last story let's say it worked for the last story

2499
02:15:16,540 --> 02:15:19,620
well last story was a different publisher Nintendo didn't have anything

2500
02:15:19,620 --> 02:15:22,620
well but it still worked somebody noticed that somebody put it out and

2501
02:15:22,620 --> 02:15:25,660
somebody took the risk that Nintendo wouldn't take and no one fucking

2502
02:15:25,660 --> 02:15:29,340
recognized president cat I mean seriously president cat there was a big

2503
02:15:29,340 --> 02:15:34,740
campaign behind it for a few weeks and then well I'm maybe president cat will

2504
02:15:34,740 --> 02:15:38,100
be a Wii U launch time perhaps we need a hundred thousand strong for president

2505
02:15:38,100 --> 02:15:46,860
can I think we had a good 50 on Twitter 50 period all right moving that's how

2506
02:15:46,860 --> 02:15:51,340
many copies of the game sold in Japan to apparently all right dark Sakura another

2507
02:15:51,340 --> 02:15:57,060
story please well there was a leak yeah I know everything I've talked about so

2508
02:15:57,060 --> 02:16:04,580
far has been leaks but there was video footage out for Rayman legends that was

2509
02:16:04,580 --> 02:16:10,340
a the Wii U version and it showed the how its graphical power the touchscreen

2510
02:16:10,340 --> 02:16:14,980
tablet and the near field communication basically it had everything on there and

2511
02:16:14,980 --> 02:16:20,220
then we had a statement put out by Ubisoft that said yeah this is real and

2512
02:16:20,220 --> 02:16:25,260
they're working on it at the Montpelier is that how it's pronounced studios

2513
02:16:25,260 --> 02:16:30,580
right now and basically they said that yeah it's not the final game don't use

2514
02:16:30,580 --> 02:16:35,480
that as representative but in fact here's actually what they're uh the

2515
02:16:35,480 --> 02:16:39,860
actual statement is I'll just read it an internal video showing images of Rayman

2516
02:16:39,860 --> 02:16:44,200
origin sequel what has leaked over the internet the video was intended as a

2517
02:16:44,200 --> 02:16:48,060
purely internal demonstrate demonstrative video and in no way

2518
02:16:48,060 --> 02:16:51,760
represents the final game the final console or their features the video was

2519
02:16:51,760 --> 02:16:58,260
destined for internal production teams who often create game prototypes with

2520
02:16:58,260 --> 02:17:02,140
work-in-progress development kits Ubisoft confirms the development of Rayman

2521
02:17:02,140 --> 02:17:08,100
legends handled by I guess that's Michelle Ancel and his team in Montpelier

2522
02:17:08,100 --> 02:17:15,860
so that's it well sucks for them that that got out but these things tend to

2523
02:17:15,860 --> 02:17:18,820
happen I don't know why you would create a sizzle reel for a different department

2524
02:17:18,820 --> 02:17:24,300
in your company we have a big company demos yeah I think it's more like

2525
02:17:24,300 --> 02:17:28,980
something that there's gonna show at e3 that kind of could be or it could have

2526
02:17:28,980 --> 02:17:33,860
been an early I mean maybe not the final cut so to speak I could see I have heard

2527
02:17:33,860 --> 02:17:37,620
it would be in case of keeping funding I have heard from people that I know that

2528
02:17:37,620 --> 02:17:42,180
work in development and so forth that they do sometimes these you know because

2529
02:17:42,180 --> 02:17:45,300
when you have these offices all over the place all over the world you do

2530
02:17:45,300 --> 02:17:48,940
sometimes have these pow-wows be it virtually or whatever where folks are

2531
02:17:48,940 --> 02:17:52,460
kind of like this is what we're working on this is what we're working on any

2532
02:17:52,460 --> 02:17:56,900
industry does this in my job it's called best practices I'm a trainer and my

2533
02:17:56,900 --> 02:17:59,380
training department gets together with other training departments we talk about

2534
02:17:59,380 --> 02:18:02,260
what's what's what are we doing right right now what can we learn from you

2535
02:18:02,260 --> 02:18:06,100
guys that's what we do I mean any big company does something like that it's

2536
02:18:06,100 --> 02:18:11,900
not a secret so I think this is just a part of that now they're gonna go with

2537
02:18:11,900 --> 02:18:17,220
other departments about not leaking your yes now that's the meeting that has to

2538
02:18:17,220 --> 02:18:23,380
be held next anyways as I was alluding to earlier in the show this is what's

2539
02:18:23,380 --> 02:18:28,260
wrong with the goddamn industry right there is this whole I'm assuming that

2540
02:18:28,260 --> 02:18:34,320
most people have seen the video and they're talking about you know the Wii U

2541
02:18:34,320 --> 02:18:37,900
integration and stuff like that which is cool you know the whole like oh one

2542
02:18:37,900 --> 02:18:42,020
person's on the Wii U tablet and they're you know moving the platforms or

2543
02:18:42,020 --> 02:18:44,180
whatever it's kind of like how they do it in a little big planet with like the

2544
02:18:44,180 --> 02:18:49,020
move support and the like the original thing although then your few near

2545
02:18:49,020 --> 02:18:53,900
field communication stuff scares me because that shit Skylanders all over

2546
02:18:53,900 --> 02:18:57,860
fucking again I mean it's like oh hey you want Rabbids world place the rabid

2547
02:18:57,860 --> 02:19:02,820
statue on the tablet oh you want to play it with Enzo place the Enzo statue on

2548
02:19:02,820 --> 02:19:06,420
the tablet oh you want hearts of the game place the heart session deposit 25

2549
02:19:06,420 --> 02:19:10,940
cents into your Wii U it's physical DLC is what that shit is and people are

2550
02:19:10,940 --> 02:19:16,460
fucking stupid and will buy the shit I want a statue of a rabbit and you've

2551
02:19:16,460 --> 02:19:20,020
suckered somebody in the purchasing a deep piece of DLC that would have been

2552
02:19:20,020 --> 02:19:24,900
$2 normally but it's a fucking cheap-ass statue that you're gonna pay $8 for not

2553
02:19:24,900 --> 02:19:29,620
gonna lie though if I could like get a cadence statue that would unlock an all

2554
02:19:29,620 --> 02:19:34,220
caden level in Mass Effect I would be all over that I would I would bow down

2555
02:19:34,220 --> 02:19:40,980
to that statue I love you game I'm just saying it it's Nintendo's tried this

2556
02:19:40,980 --> 02:19:45,440
with you know fucking AR cards with Kid Icarus if they're just experimenting

2557
02:19:45,440 --> 02:19:49,540
with this because they saw how successful Skyler's was and Skylanders

2558
02:19:49,540 --> 02:19:54,580
was a franchise that doesn't really exist it has Spyro in it but fuck it's

2559
02:19:54,580 --> 02:19:58,660
not really Spyro anymore and it's not really a Spyro franchise but it's the

2560
02:19:58,660 --> 02:20:03,260
brand-new franchise that with no backing and they sold toys and people were like

2561
02:20:03,260 --> 02:20:07,140
oh my god I need this toy even though it's like what the fuck is this toy I

2562
02:20:07,140 --> 02:20:12,980
mean it's just this new thing but can you imagine if fucking Mario did that if

2563
02:20:12,980 --> 02:20:16,340
there was a Mario game with a bunch of fucking statues it's a get you know

2564
02:20:16,340 --> 02:20:20,020
franchise with an established fan base already and then you're selling all this

2565
02:20:20,020 --> 02:20:26,380
cool shit on top of it that people oh I got to have this stuff or Pokemon oh I

2566
02:20:26,380 --> 02:20:30,460
need all the Pokemon statues so I can unlock them in game can you imagine and

2567
02:20:30,460 --> 02:20:34,980
I know you probably thinking oh that's ridiculous no it's not it's fucking in a

2568
02:20:34,980 --> 02:20:40,100
couple years time is what's gonna happen and then it's gonna get fucking

2569
02:20:40,100 --> 02:20:45,340
ridiculous Ross deal UT in the vog network chat room says calm down Loki

2570
02:20:45,340 --> 02:20:48,420
they're gonna be cash-ins for this you're not gonna see this take off

2571
02:20:48,420 --> 02:20:55,340
long-term act-def says Nintendo already did this with the e-reader but I don't

2572
02:20:55,340 --> 02:20:59,420
think the e-reader necessarily took off it was a neat idea and I I think it was

2573
02:20:59,420 --> 02:21:03,020
a great idea with some of like the stuff they did for Animal Crossing and stuff

2574
02:21:03,020 --> 02:21:07,180
but I mean I was a little different unlocking the Legend of Zelda or Super

2575
02:21:07,180 --> 02:21:11,100
Mario Brothers in a game is pretty cool compared to like you know and how much

2576
02:21:11,100 --> 02:21:15,380
were those cards they weren't them expensive man the old-school Animal

2577
02:21:15,380 --> 02:21:19,620
Crossing on the GameCube did it the best with the whole like old games oh man

2578
02:21:19,620 --> 02:21:24,660
that's such a deal that Nintendo wants you to forget ever happened all right

2579
02:21:24,660 --> 02:21:29,100
so I I got to share this funny comment from Shane cuz I was talking about the

2580
02:21:29,100 --> 02:21:34,420
cadence statues so Shane's in our chat room at the vog network calm oh excuse

2581
02:21:34,420 --> 02:21:38,380
me vog network calm I almost said the old chair who somebody everybody in

2582
02:21:38,380 --> 02:21:41,660
chats waiting for one of us to fuck up tonight and say something old

2583
02:21:41,660 --> 02:21:46,420
Shane says I would buy all those statues talking about the cadence statues all up

2584
02:21:46,420 --> 02:21:52,940
before you could even see one Rob can I tell you a funny story about Shane we

2585
02:21:52,940 --> 02:21:58,380
were talking in the car while I was on my way I this week I drove to LA at

2586
02:21:58,380 --> 02:22:04,260
midnight I drove to LA from midnight to 5 a.m. I had Victoria with me but I had

2587
02:22:04,260 --> 02:22:07,820
to drive to stock to the Stockton area to pick Victoria up from Sacramento she

2588
02:22:07,820 --> 02:22:10,160
lives in a town called Livermore for those of you guys familiar with

2589
02:22:10,160 --> 02:22:12,880
California so it's about an hour and a half away from where I'm at so I'm

2590
02:22:12,880 --> 02:22:15,700
driving down there about 10 o'clock at night and I call Shane on the road just

2591
02:22:15,700 --> 02:22:18,420
you know I'm like Shane entertain me so he's talking about I'm trying to pick

2592
02:22:18,420 --> 02:22:22,580
out a new gamertag and I can't think of I can't think of what gamertag to pick

2593
02:22:22,580 --> 02:22:25,020
out cuz I want a new gamertag and I asked him if I could share this with you

2594
02:22:25,020 --> 02:22:29,820
guys and I said well Shane you need to just put something you really love in

2595
02:22:29,820 --> 02:22:34,620
your gamertag he's like I can't get Caden everything everything Caden is

2596
02:22:34,620 --> 02:22:40,380
taken I said why don't you make your gamertag Shane a lingo like you've

2597
02:22:40,380 --> 02:22:43,620
married cuz Caden's name is a lingo I said why don't you make your gamertag

2598
02:22:43,620 --> 02:22:47,660
Shane a lingo and he's like I'm gonna do that yes and he changed his gamertag so

2599
02:22:47,660 --> 02:22:57,340
he's now Shane a lingo he took Caden's name what Cadence no that doesn't work

2600
02:22:57,660 --> 02:23:03,540
all right anyhow there it is that was your random tangent story hey two more

2601
02:23:03,540 --> 02:23:06,940
stories which is a lot more interesting than your grocery store dance thank you

2602
02:23:06,940 --> 02:23:11,380
thank you shut up all right two more stories and then Twitter and Skype well

2603
02:23:11,380 --> 02:23:17,620
this is an unusual chain of events apparently Nexon is looking to take

2604
02:23:17,620 --> 02:23:25,460
over EA they're actually bidding to buy EA apparently they're really big in South

2605
02:23:25,460 --> 02:23:30,580
Korea and they have a lot of money I don't think that they're actually gonna

2606
02:23:30,580 --> 02:23:39,540
take them over but it's interesting that they're trying it's kind of funny that

2607
02:23:39,540 --> 02:23:44,340
somebody's like trying to take on EA but everybody's laughing kind of pointing

2608
02:23:44,340 --> 02:23:47,260
laughing that's going how cute and you're just waiting for it to flip the

2609
02:23:47,260 --> 02:23:56,300
other way why don't we buy you always a bigger fish who do you think could buy

2610
02:23:56,300 --> 02:24:03,140
EA if anyone Microsoft Sony I guess I mean who's bigger than EA at this point

2611
02:24:03,140 --> 02:24:06,660
in the gaming why would they want to like a Viacom or something like that to

2612
02:24:06,660 --> 02:24:10,740
stop EA from all this multi-platform online stuff they're trying to do and

2613
02:24:10,740 --> 02:24:15,140
lock EA and all their games into one particular system I can't imagine

2614
02:24:15,140 --> 02:24:20,660
Microsoft event key oh yeah hey sports games we have them no one else says

2615
02:24:20,660 --> 02:24:26,540
Facebook is gonna pay 1 billion dollars for Instagram surely there's a way if

2616
02:24:26,540 --> 02:24:31,860
Microsoft wants it bad enough they could snap up EA and every every EA exclusive

2617
02:24:31,860 --> 02:24:37,380
is now Microsoft exclusive including the sports franchises Mass Effect Dragon Age

2618
02:24:37,380 --> 02:24:40,140
I'm thinking of all the Bioware stuff is this the stuff I like but you know all

2619
02:24:40,140 --> 02:24:46,740
the battlefield battlefield I mean but because of that EA probably just cost

2620
02:24:46,740 --> 02:24:53,340
too damn much yeah team Ron in our chat room says Ted Turner should buy EA Ted

2621
02:24:53,340 --> 02:24:59,140
Turner actually they tried to do gaming Turner was game tap turn the Turner

2622
02:24:59,140 --> 02:25:02,500
Network stuff started game tap back in the day back when game tap was alright

2623
02:25:02,500 --> 02:25:06,140
game tap was really interesting when it finally they could come back if they

2624
02:25:06,140 --> 02:25:09,380
really yeah I kind of went to crap since the beginning like it just now it just

2625
02:25:09,380 --> 02:25:12,100
blends in with the rest when it had kind of like its own player and they were

2626
02:25:12,100 --> 02:25:15,700
talking about like the desktop stuff and all that and had its own launcher it was

2627
02:25:15,700 --> 02:25:19,740
really neat looking now it's just it just looks like any other it just it

2628
02:25:19,740 --> 02:25:22,500
blends right in with everything else like what game flies doing and all that

2629
02:25:22,500 --> 02:25:27,780
other stuff so and plus for a while game tap was like the only place you could

2630
02:25:27,780 --> 02:25:30,780
play missed online some of that other stuff you should come out with the

2631
02:25:30,780 --> 02:25:35,420
console it'll be a PC from like ten years ago they'll the old stuff maybe

2632
02:25:35,420 --> 02:25:40,860
who knows hey what do we do these old PCs they kind of I've got an idea don't

2633
02:25:40,860 --> 02:25:46,580
you see that happen with the NES stuff like you see those are the the oh yeah

2634
02:25:46,580 --> 02:25:51,660
like you know 101 built into the NES because all the patents on the old NES

2635
02:25:51,660 --> 02:25:56,300
stuff is expired the actual hardware pirates don't give a fuck yeah exactly

2636
02:25:56,300 --> 02:26:00,100
well and Nintendo doesn't really protect it very well either I don't know if they

2637
02:26:00,100 --> 02:26:06,620
can't or what the deal is but let's see DJ Dark Knight in our chair and says

2638
02:26:06,620 --> 02:26:11,940
totally forgot about game tap lol yeah that's game taps problem they used to

2639
02:26:11,940 --> 02:26:15,860
have really funny commercials and the reason why was because they had Turner

2640
02:26:15,860 --> 02:26:21,980
Network behind them so they had the the ability to do some fun TV stuff sake in

2641
02:26:21,980 --> 02:26:27,180
our chat room hi sake says yep game tap resurrected missed online or ooh was the

2642
02:26:27,180 --> 02:26:31,860
name of that I did I missed online was creepy this is kind of a creepy game to

2643
02:26:31,860 --> 02:26:35,540
me by the way since I say eggs and chat I should say everybody check out walking

2644
02:26:35,540 --> 02:26:40,020
dead just came out I think say would appreciate me throwing that out there

2645
02:26:40,020 --> 02:26:44,140
all right one more story for you guys and then the skype line at one eight

2646
02:26:44,140 --> 02:26:51,740
seven seven game olr or our username on skype orange lounge radio this is a new

2647
02:26:51,740 --> 02:26:58,700
story about an old game that's new again what do I mean by that well 30 years

2648
02:26:58,700 --> 02:27:03,140
after the fact something that was supposed to be impossible has finally

2649
02:27:03,140 --> 02:27:10,100
happened the game star castle has been condensed onto an Atari 2600 cartridge

2650
02:27:10,100 --> 02:27:16,780
that's right remember the game star castle nope well somebody does I actually

2651
02:27:16,780 --> 02:27:19,580
I think it was a pretty big game in the 80s but because it never had a home port

2652
02:27:19,580 --> 02:27:23,300
I think a lot of people forgot it well what's interesting Howard Scott Warshaw

2653
02:27:23,300 --> 02:27:28,060
who made you know yards revenge et love him or hate him he made some great games

2654
02:27:28,060 --> 02:27:33,540
and some bad games on the Atari 2600 he said star castle could never be stuffed

2655
02:27:33,540 --> 02:27:37,260
into a game cartridge that's why they never did it because they just there was

2656
02:27:37,260 --> 02:27:41,700
no way they could have done it in 8k well Scott Williamson who was one of

2657
02:27:41,700 --> 02:27:44,500
these guys back in the day that was doing stuff for the 2600 he never

2658
02:27:44,500 --> 02:27:50,220
believed it so here we are 30 years later I love this this is like something

2659
02:27:50,220 --> 02:27:56,580
Loki would do don't you ever tell me I can't do something because damn it

2660
02:27:56,580 --> 02:28:03,380
someday I'm gonna fucking do it here we are 30 years later and Scott Williamson

2661
02:28:03,380 --> 02:28:09,580
achieved it he got star castle down into a format for the Atari 2600 he is now

2662
02:28:09,580 --> 02:28:13,820
the technical director at development studio high voltage what I think is

2663
02:28:13,820 --> 02:28:19,020
really cool though they made this custom cartridge and I actually really love

2664
02:28:19,020 --> 02:28:22,540
this there's a great YouTube where you can check this out the frickin cartridge

2665
02:28:22,540 --> 02:28:27,980
lights up they built these little lights into the cartridge so that as you're

2666
02:28:27,980 --> 02:28:31,180
playing it I'm trying to get to like a part where you see it in the video here

2667
02:28:31,180 --> 02:28:34,300
because I don't want to play the whole like two and a half minute video it's

2668
02:28:34,300 --> 02:28:38,940
pretty cool yeah oh yeah the game looks great but there's a part in it where you

2669
02:28:38,940 --> 02:28:42,820
actually see the little cartridge is like lighting up with the game it's

2670
02:28:42,820 --> 02:28:46,060
technology like at the time oh my god can you imagine if somebody had done

2671
02:28:46,060 --> 02:28:50,900
this when Atari 2600 was like new yeah oh there it is here look at this part

2672
02:28:50,900 --> 02:28:56,860
here in the video see like it's lighting up with the game and you can actually

2673
02:28:56,860 --> 02:29:01,140
buy that cartridge you can and if you want to get a copy of the cartridge you

2674
02:29:01,140 --> 02:29:03,940
know they're trying to fund an effort right now to get that cartridge made

2675
02:29:03,940 --> 02:29:07,380
they want to make a lot of these and sell these so where does everybody go

2676
02:29:07,380 --> 02:29:12,500
and they need money fast in this day and age kick-farter that's right it's a kick

2677
02:29:12,500 --> 02:29:19,380
farter so if you go to Kickstarter it's the Atari 2600 star castle I gotta say

2678
02:29:19,380 --> 02:29:25,260
this one's I I like this better than a lot of the ones I've read the goal is

2679
02:29:25,260 --> 02:29:29,940
reasonable $10,000 and $10,000 they've already met it with 24 days to go

2680
02:29:29,940 --> 02:29:33,940
they're already at $14,000 and if you want to get a copy of the cartridge I

2681
02:29:33,940 --> 02:29:38,780
think it's $50 or more yeah yeah pledge $50 you get the clear cast acrylic star

2682
02:29:38,780 --> 02:29:43,300
castle cartridge featuring lights that flash with the game action serial number

2683
02:29:43,300 --> 02:29:48,140
and and so forth that's one of the few that I can get behind I mean it sounds

2684
02:29:48,140 --> 02:29:53,220
pretty cool just for the fact that I'd be buying the actual cartridge I am

2685
02:29:53,220 --> 02:29:56,660
forever more they're going to refer to those things as kick-farters that's a

2686
02:29:56,660 --> 02:30:02,260
great name I am so against them except if they give me money I don't know man

2687
02:30:02,260 --> 02:30:07,180
I I've contributed to two and both are pretty good video game high school and

2688
02:30:07,180 --> 02:30:12,740
shadowrun because I like me some shadowrun and Freddie Wong man whatever

2689
02:30:12,740 --> 02:30:19,220
whatever he makes it wants money for I'll pay for it all right I think that's

2690
02:30:19,220 --> 02:30:22,700
about the time where we're gonna open up the skype line die oh yeah I have Skype

2691
02:30:22,700 --> 02:30:27,340
open I just had us on D&D so let me unlock that there and we're gonna cast

2692
02:30:27,340 --> 02:30:34,420
magic missile it's open it's on D&D right one do not disturb 1 8 7 you're a

2693
02:30:34,420 --> 02:30:40,180
little disturbing all right oh you have a last minute story go for it I was

2694
02:30:40,180 --> 02:30:45,260
interested in awesomenauts it turns out that their publisher DTP entertainment

2695
02:30:45,260 --> 02:30:49,040
filed for as they say overseas insolvency which is pretty much the

2696
02:30:49,040 --> 02:30:56,660
equivalent of bankruptcy so it may not make them a second really state but um

2697
02:30:56,660 --> 02:31:00,980
Romano games which is the developers really trying to work on getting it out

2698
02:31:00,980 --> 02:31:05,420
so so I'm looking at our chat room at chat owners on traded calm I noticed

2699
02:31:05,420 --> 02:31:09,020
sake is suddenly getting an impromptu interview in the chat room because

2700
02:31:09,020 --> 02:31:11,660
people are like saying did you work on walking dead that was awesome because

2701
02:31:11,660 --> 02:31:14,940
apparently walk I have not played it myself yet because I haven't watched the

2702
02:31:14,940 --> 02:31:18,380
show although I understand the game is based off the books I do still want to

2703
02:31:18,380 --> 02:31:22,020
check it out because I hear it's really good everybody's really loving the game

2704
02:31:22,020 --> 02:31:27,820
so sake is giving an impromptu interview at vog network calm and I want to

2705
02:31:27,820 --> 02:31:31,540
mention what Blackwell says in the chat room $50 is about how much you'd be

2706
02:31:31,540 --> 02:31:35,580
paying for a custom 2600 cartridge anyway so that's a decent price I paid

2707
02:31:35,580 --> 02:31:41,340
40 bucks for halo 2600 somebody actually did halo 2600 all right mm-hmm let's go

2708
02:31:41,340 --> 02:31:45,820
to the phones hi you are on orange launch radio who's this this is Shane

2709
02:31:45,820 --> 02:31:52,660
also known as Shane Alenko thanks to you hey Shane what's up um nothing I'm just

2710
02:31:52,660 --> 02:31:57,260
playing the wild bay that's night oh I'm bored you're just calling to say hey

2711
02:31:57,260 --> 02:32:05,020
no actually I was thinking about stuff but yes I decided to call said stuff you

2712
02:32:05,020 --> 02:32:11,540
can hear more about the Wow beta on best little horde house in Azeroth at www.hordehouse.com

2713
02:32:11,540 --> 02:32:17,300
we have nothing to say about horde house and vog yet but we'll see so

2714
02:32:17,300 --> 02:32:21,300
anyway Shane what did you really want to call it about um I was thinking about

2715
02:32:21,300 --> 02:32:26,480
those rumors of the midnight purple 3ds since it's popping up all over the place

2716
02:32:26,480 --> 02:32:31,580
on a room like online sites it's not a rumor they have a picture of it well

2717
02:32:31,580 --> 02:32:36,380
because it was 83 as one of the concept colors a long time ago I wasn't well it

2718
02:32:36,380 --> 02:32:41,340
might not be that specific color it could be slightly changed do I if that

2719
02:32:41,340 --> 02:32:47,380
if if that color comes out that will be the first time I will ever as I call it

2720
02:32:47,380 --> 02:32:55,420
quote pull a Shane and buy a $250 system just because it's in a nice new color

2721
02:32:55,420 --> 02:33:00,220
I will I'm gonna upgrade if that's the case because I can't tell the difference

2722
02:33:00,220 --> 02:33:06,100
between blue and purple so to me it's a new blue system for me I'm really happy

2723
02:33:06,100 --> 02:33:11,860
with that but wouldn't that make it all the less I don't know likely they would

2724
02:33:11,860 --> 02:33:16,940
announce a redesign at e3 for the 3ds no no because they were still releasing

2725
02:33:16,940 --> 02:33:20,820
even after the DSI XL came out they released the DSI and like pretty pink

2726
02:33:20,820 --> 02:33:26,460
and all this stuff so not necessarily plus I it may still be too soon this

2727
02:33:26,460 --> 02:33:31,260
year still may be too soon for the redesign the 3ds is only a year old I

2728
02:33:31,260 --> 02:33:34,100
see this is the kind of thing that's in a two-year cycle and also because

2729
02:33:34,100 --> 02:33:37,020
they're trying to make sure that they're not losing more money on they're adding

2730
02:33:37,020 --> 02:33:41,140
more components to a system might not be a good idea yeah this year is about the

2731
02:33:41,140 --> 02:33:44,780
Wii U I don't think I mean certainly they still want people to buy the 3ds

2732
02:33:44,780 --> 02:33:49,380
but I don't do a 3ds XL with the extra add-on built in I just don't think they

2733
02:33:49,380 --> 02:33:53,820
would do a 3ds XL or whatever and owe the Wii U in the same year I think this

2734
02:33:53,820 --> 02:33:58,020
year will be the Wii U next year will be their 3ds redesign year after that

2735
02:33:58,020 --> 02:34:03,140
something some huge add-on for the Wii U or something okay then what about this

2736
02:34:03,140 --> 02:34:08,940
what game are they going to launch that makes that color make sense what purple

2737
02:34:08,940 --> 02:34:13,780
yeah because they tend to launch games that kind of fit with the new color

2738
02:34:13,780 --> 02:34:20,660
schemes like they had in Japan they had the Fire Emblem blue they've had stuff

2739
02:34:20,660 --> 02:34:25,940
similar to that I don't know I can't think my Pokemon purple no Luigi's

2740
02:34:25,940 --> 02:34:32,300
Mansion 2 or Animal Crossing while Luigi takes over the world because he was

2741
02:34:32,300 --> 02:34:37,420
purple right yeah maybe he's in crappy Luigi's Mansion 2 very hopefully is

2742
02:34:37,420 --> 02:34:43,020
better than that e3 demo I played there you go or what else what else is purple

2743
02:34:43,020 --> 02:34:50,540
Barney the Barney the dinosaur he's coming back you know well maybe maybe

2744
02:34:50,540 --> 02:34:53,980
the license on Barney now that it's been 20 years is so cheap maybe somebody else

2745
02:34:53,980 --> 02:34:57,820
is licensed them and now we can finally get our Barney killer game Barney

2746
02:34:57,820 --> 02:35:04,620
sniper so 90s already Barney 20 years after nobody hold on hold on hold on are

2747
02:35:04,620 --> 02:35:08,580
you all sitting here and telling me that if some company released a game called

2748
02:35:08,580 --> 02:35:12,660
birthday party Barney sniper you would not be the least bit interest no I would

2749
02:35:12,660 --> 02:35:16,940
not be actually no I am so over that excuse me excuse me

2750
02:35:16,940 --> 02:35:21,060
Shane this whole wood cars about life if you try should we be like talk to the

2751
02:35:21,060 --> 02:35:25,620
hand because that's another stupid 90s reference no excuse me because what are

2752
02:35:25,620 --> 02:35:29,380
you talking about no one cares about stuff in the 90s with your Power Rangers

2753
02:35:29,380 --> 02:35:34,100
obsession different because that's not different you know what came on after

2754
02:35:34,100 --> 02:35:39,900
Barney Power Rangers I think if it's fair to share or repeat something again

2755
02:35:39,900 --> 02:35:44,740
but they are doing a Power Rangers samurai connect game they'll be coming

2756
02:35:44,740 --> 02:35:48,140
I told people at work that also care about Power Rangers and they all freaked

2757
02:35:48,140 --> 02:35:53,180
out about that just like I did so that worked there at least before people that

2758
02:35:53,180 --> 02:35:59,540
buy that game well there you go and that's all the copies that will sell

2759
02:35:59,540 --> 02:36:02,820
that's more people than bought president cat in Japan all right

2760
02:36:02,820 --> 02:36:07,140
Shane what else anything else you want to share with us tonight or ask about or

2761
02:36:07,140 --> 02:36:12,820
whatever I don't know my I hurts oh no but here let me ask you about this since

2762
02:36:12,820 --> 02:36:17,060
you're the guy that always likes to talk about Mass Effect yes I am um what did

2763
02:36:17,060 --> 02:36:20,540
you think about my little negative aspect of Mass Effect 3 some people in

2764
02:36:20,540 --> 02:36:24,300
the chat room didn't take too well to that I wait what was you know say it one

2765
02:36:24,300 --> 02:36:28,800
more time for me because I don't know if I fully grasp what I don't like tension

2766
02:36:28,800 --> 02:36:34,060
that it's not that I hate that you have to play multiplayer in order to do

2767
02:36:34,060 --> 02:36:37,900
better in single-player especially in light of the whole iOS thing but I

2768
02:36:37,900 --> 02:36:41,300
really hate that a it's the easiest way to do it and B what really pisses me off

2769
02:36:41,300 --> 02:36:45,220
is the fact that you can buy those little boxes with Microsoft points as

2770
02:36:45,220 --> 02:36:49,420
well as in-game credits because to me that's trying to it's trying to have

2771
02:36:49,420 --> 02:36:54,280
your cake and eat it too you're trying to do a free Facebook game and charge me

2772
02:36:54,280 --> 02:37:00,020
$60 for the game up front I didn't like about I don't really agree with your

2773
02:37:00,020 --> 02:37:07,100
negativity because a if there are people that want to pay real money to unlock

2774
02:37:07,100 --> 02:37:12,420
extra guns or extra customization on their characters instead of just playing

2775
02:37:12,420 --> 02:37:16,540
through the modes like you should let them they're not making me pay for it so

2776
02:37:16,540 --> 02:37:19,700
I don't really care I'm saying please don't do it because you're encouraging

2777
02:37:19,700 --> 02:37:23,060
him to do it in other stuff and more often I just I think it's a bad

2778
02:37:23,060 --> 02:37:27,220
precedent is that if these people don't do it someone else will it's already out

2779
02:37:27,220 --> 02:37:30,580
there with like you know it's half out there rather with like all those

2780
02:37:30,580 --> 02:37:34,380
Facebook games oh I could play there's a um that you don't know Jack game

2781
02:37:34,380 --> 02:37:38,060
apparently on Facebook is in beta and it's apparently really fun but you only

2782
02:37:38,060 --> 02:37:42,820
get like five games per day and they're really short unless you buy you know

2783
02:37:42,820 --> 02:37:46,940
credits or something wait a minute you don't know Jack is on Facebook it's in

2784
02:37:46,940 --> 02:37:51,380
beta right now I know what I'm doing after the show or has it I knew what I'm

2785
02:37:51,380 --> 02:37:54,860
doing after the show nope you have to sign up for the beta I haven't got in

2786
02:37:54,860 --> 02:37:59,260
since I damn it up yet yes I know I once I heard about I was like sign me up

2787
02:37:59,260 --> 02:38:08,780
really quick but to even if there wasn't an iOS game to help you raise your

2788
02:38:08,780 --> 02:38:13,660
galactic readiness level like I hated the idea of having to play multiplayer

2789
02:38:13,660 --> 02:38:19,500
just to get a quote-unquote better ending because they all suck but like

2790
02:38:19,500 --> 02:38:23,340
the multiplayer is so enjoyable and you don't have to listen to other people if

2791
02:38:23,340 --> 02:38:26,380
you don't want to and you just run around I'm terrible at the Xbox when I

2792
02:38:26,380 --> 02:38:30,380
get killed all the time but I don't care I'm still having a blast playing it so I

2793
02:38:30,380 --> 02:38:35,460
think if it was a multiplayer that sucked yeah then boo to that but they

2794
02:38:35,460 --> 02:38:40,220
did a really good job and I don't think it's that big of an issue that you

2795
02:38:40,220 --> 02:38:44,140
should play multiplayer to have a better ending because you can take those

2796
02:38:44,140 --> 02:38:48,340
characters and use them as I think war assets once they hit 20 or something

2797
02:38:48,340 --> 02:38:52,080
like that and speaking of which since you brought it up I believe after the

2798
02:38:52,080 --> 02:38:55,860
show tonight we're gonna be playing some Mass Effect online right yes we are did

2799
02:38:55,860 --> 02:38:58,860
you did you get people can join us did you get some I thought you were in try

2800
02:38:58,860 --> 02:39:03,060
and recruit somebody to play with us nope can't play tonight that person so

2801
02:39:03,060 --> 02:39:07,920
you need to you need to send out like some sort of whatever you call it all

2802
02:39:07,920 --> 02:39:14,300
right get on Xbox hold on show Mass Effect 3 meet up there you go yes all

you're on orange launch radio who's this hey it's pork chop is gone hey I'm good

2810
02:39:49,860 --> 02:39:54,260

2811
02:39:54,260 --> 02:39:59,500
goes well for you guys so thank you we hope so too if it crashes and burns well

2812
02:39:59,500 --> 02:40:04,740
oh well it was fun trying well I doubt it you guys do a pretty good job anyway

2813
02:40:04,740 --> 02:40:08,460
you know this is important to say when we started orange launch radio in the

2814
02:40:08,460 --> 02:40:13,860
old network I think you can you know I can't say this enough we did orange

2815
02:40:13,860 --> 02:40:19,180
launch radio for 12 people for a very long time you know and a lot of people

2816
02:40:19,180 --> 02:40:22,220
really didn't know about us and it's not like we have thousands of thousands of

2817
02:40:22,220 --> 02:40:26,380
listeners now it's relatively still a really small show but we're okay with

2818
02:40:26,380 --> 02:40:30,020
that you know we feel like we're really connected with our community and it's

2819
02:40:30,020 --> 02:40:35,220
it's cool I like it suppose it's very dedicated kind of community as well so I

2820
02:40:35,220 --> 02:40:41,420
mean I like this and so I guess you got me staying up till all hours so well

2821
02:40:41,420 --> 02:40:45,500
that is a great I'm not too much because I can't talk over you all the time so

2822
02:40:45,500 --> 02:40:48,820
that's right I was just gonna say when you sacrifice the greatness that is

2823
02:40:48,820 --> 02:40:53,540
sleep to listen to this show we take it as a great compliment but anyway what

2824
02:40:53,540 --> 02:40:57,060
did you want to talk to our talk about or ask us about tonight I wanted to

2825
02:40:57,060 --> 02:41:00,440
mention remember you're talking about six axes one of the games that was

2826
02:41:00,440 --> 02:41:04,220
pretty overlooked I don't know if many people bought it was loco roko I remember

2827
02:41:04,220 --> 02:41:08,820
buying that on PSN and I played the shit out of that I mean on PSP it was okay

2828
02:41:08,820 --> 02:41:13,260
but you know you could actually control everything with the six axis you could

2829
02:41:13,260 --> 02:41:17,820
rotate the screen you could turn everything around and stuff so I mean

2830
02:41:17,820 --> 02:41:22,500
that was one of the best ones I think I did was that a gun that went off in the

2831
02:41:22,500 --> 02:41:33,100
background it was my Android okay I'm actually talking okay it was a duck

2832
02:41:33,100 --> 02:41:38,660
quite they have ducks over there no loco roko is is pretty awesome you're

2833
02:41:38,660 --> 02:41:41,900
right I forgot about loco roko and that's a good one to remind us of does

2834
02:41:41,900 --> 02:41:45,780
this mean hey does this mean loco roko needs to show up in the Sony Super

2835
02:41:45,780 --> 02:41:53,540
Battle Royale a loco roko level that's a good idea that I want them yes that

2836
02:41:53,540 --> 02:41:58,900
would be hilarious you're actually able to flip the screen somehow oh everyone

2837
02:41:58,900 --> 02:42:02,900
on their heads do pork chops should be designing games I love that idea the

2838
02:42:02,900 --> 02:42:06,900
whole like flip the screen like get a power-up that does that oh that'd be

2839
02:42:06,900 --> 02:42:11,420
awesome sorry be awesome well pork chop are you looking forward to the super

2840
02:42:11,420 --> 02:42:15,900
Sony fighter or whatever it's called I'm in two minds about it I mean this the

2841
02:42:15,900 --> 02:42:19,500
first I've heard of it was tonight so I'm still thinking about it I'm

2842
02:42:19,500 --> 02:42:22,740
wondering is it gonna be worthwhile I mean it's not gonna be Super Smash

2843
02:42:22,740 --> 02:42:26,860
Brothers that was fun and again I mean as long as Microsoft don't try it I mean

2844
02:42:26,860 --> 02:42:32,020
that's gonna be an all-time piece of shit if you ask me it's just gonna be 12

2845
02:42:32,020 --> 02:42:37,820
Master Chief's as it was said in chat so well we'll see we'll see what happens

2857
02:43:39,220 --> 02:43:44,900
direction of g4 no I can tell you know what I I think I can safely say no there

2858
02:43:44,900 --> 02:43:48,740
I am fairly certain they have no interest in rerunning cheaters or cops

2859
02:43:48,740 --> 02:43:54,140
yes I from what I understand there's some other great gaming and gaming

2860
02:43:54,140 --> 02:43:58,860
related programming coming over there that that'll be great and you know that's

2861
02:43:58,860 --> 02:44:06,060
I'll be I'll be listening when I can it'll be interesting hey I'm just on a

2862
02:44:06,060 --> 02:44:09,540
technical note notice I've been getting some feedback when I'm talking I've been

2863
02:44:09,540 --> 02:44:14,340
hearing like pieces of myself you might yeah because in studio here we're too

2864
02:44:14,340 --> 02:44:17,180
cheap to have headsets for everybody so we actually play the calls over the

2865
02:44:17,180 --> 02:44:21,020
speaker so sometimes you get picked up just a little bit by our microphones so

2866
02:44:21,020 --> 02:44:25,540
sometimes our callers complain of that so apologies about that but you know one

2867
02:44:25,540 --> 02:44:29,500
of these days we'll have to go I don't know sell things on the side of the

2868
02:44:29,500 --> 02:44:33,320
freeway to get money for proper headphones for everybody actually that

2869
02:44:33,320 --> 02:44:36,220
was something I thought about doing for the studio but just never got around to

2870
02:44:36,220 --> 02:44:42,020
it but anyway I do yeah that might be a good idea I mean it's not like I get

2871
02:44:42,020 --> 02:44:45,620
office headsets or something well the good news is it's only you that has to

2872
02:44:45,620 --> 02:44:51,000
hear it are the over the radio it sounds fine and so I kind of go okay well one

2873
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:54,660
person can suffer a little bit so all the others listening can hear it okay so

2874
02:44:54,660 --> 02:45:03,780
I apologize so games what's up what games you've been playing lately or was

2875
02:45:03,780 --> 02:45:07,620
there game news you want to mention tonight well lately I've been playing a

2876
02:45:07,620 --> 02:45:12,900
lot of Soul Caliber five Soul Caliber five yeah one of our listeners and I

2877
02:45:12,900 --> 02:45:16,060
were trying to meet up to play and it just wasn't working out for various

2878
02:45:16,060 --> 02:45:21,300
reasons but man some of the custom creations and I think he posted some of

2879
02:45:21,300 --> 02:45:25,980
them on Facebook Stan posted it on Facebook it's it's hilarious what people

2880
02:45:25,980 --> 02:45:29,500
are doing with those custom characters it's so robust but yeah so Caliber five

2881
02:45:29,500 --> 02:45:34,740
yeah time oh yeah I saw this one video on YouTube it was a Waldo player uh-huh

2882
02:45:34,740 --> 02:45:40,060
and and he made this character based off of Waldo with a huge purple furry

2883
02:45:40,060 --> 02:45:48,540
palace because and I got the episode yeah it's the only like and sorry I was

2884
02:45:48,540 --> 02:45:51,700
just gonna say something go ahead that's right it's old classic saying that we

2885
02:45:51,700 --> 02:45:55,740
say about video games it's called time to penis whenever something new comes

2886
02:45:55,740 --> 02:45:59,860
as the TTP the time to penis whenever something new comes out where there's

2887
02:45:59,860 --> 02:46:04,100
either a peripheral so for a peripheral it's how long till someone puts their

2888
02:46:04,100 --> 02:46:08,660
dick on it but then with these creative modes and custom things it's how long

2889
02:46:08,660 --> 02:46:14,500
till someone makes a dick and the answer is usually 0.5 seconds oh yeah it was

2890
02:46:14,500 --> 02:46:17,860
not long at all I think the YouTube video was like from February so it's

2891
02:46:17,860 --> 02:46:20,660
like very soon after the game came out it's not long at all that's what she

2892
02:46:20,660 --> 02:46:29,940
said I mean the thing that I'm sorry I'm laughing a bit but um the thing that's

2893
02:46:29,940 --> 02:46:34,620
got me about um instead of been playing a lot of phone caliber is that you know

2894
02:46:34,620 --> 02:46:39,500
it's very hard to define you know fighting coverage that isn't really

2895
02:46:39,500 --> 02:46:44,260
centered around Capcom you know it's gotten to the point where I don't know

2896
02:46:44,260 --> 02:46:47,860
if you follow tournaments at all but it really feels like you know a lot of the

2897
02:46:47,860 --> 02:46:52,700
players are forcing themselves with them with Street Fighter cross second because

2898
02:46:52,700 --> 02:46:56,260
you know playing the Capcom game seems to be the only game way to get any

2899
02:46:56,260 --> 02:47:02,060
coverage interesting so you think Namco is getting well I mean I guess maybe not

2900
02:47:02,060 --> 02:47:05,020
because Namco is kind of the other half of Street Fighter cross tech and

2901
02:47:05,020 --> 02:47:11,260
although technically it's a Capcom game what about what about Mortal Kombat are

2902
02:47:11,260 --> 02:47:14,140
people not taking that seriously I mean Mortal Kombat I thought was a pretty

2903
02:47:14,140 --> 02:47:18,340
good fighting game but I guess it is the thing is people people play these games

2904
02:47:18,340 --> 02:47:23,780
seriously I mean maybe not as much if there are a lot of people I mean um you

2905
02:47:23,780 --> 02:47:27,340
know so kind of a five in Mortal Kombat 9 are part of the games being featured

2906
02:47:27,340 --> 02:47:32,340
in major league gaming now but you know it's hard to find coverage if it's not a

2907
02:47:32,340 --> 02:47:37,460
bypass on game so it's hard to find you know people talking about it people you

2908
02:47:37,460 --> 02:47:40,420
know any sort of cup you know any sort of coverage of the events of things like

2909
02:47:40,420 --> 02:47:44,660
that why do you think that is you know the as you're saying that you're kind of

2910
02:47:44,660 --> 02:47:47,900
right whenever I hear about fighting game community it does seem like Capcom

2911
02:47:47,900 --> 02:47:52,060
first other games second I mean granted there are other games like Stan says

2912
02:47:52,060 --> 02:47:55,220
King of Fighters which is another good one to you know Soul Calibur as was

2913
02:47:55,220 --> 02:47:57,820
mentioned it's not like there's not other good fighting games out there but

2914
02:47:57,820 --> 02:48:00,420
you're kind of right whenever I hear about like fighting game tournaments and

2915
02:48:00,420 --> 02:48:03,860
who's popular it's always Street Fighter something that it comes down to why is

2916
02:48:03,860 --> 02:48:09,940
that why do you think that is I mean it's hard hell I mean obviously part of

2917
02:48:09,940 --> 02:48:14,380
it is because you know one of the first big fighting games was Street Fighter 2

2918
02:48:14,380 --> 02:48:20,860
I mean that that's the jump off for a lot of players true but I think at this

2919
02:48:20,860 --> 02:48:27,700
point you have a you have a lot of major sites that really they didn't know it's

2920
02:48:27,700 --> 02:48:31,260
like anything else they don't want to go out of their wheelhouse and it and it's

2921
02:48:31,260 --> 02:48:34,780
kind of frustrating we have to dig around for for science but for other

2922
02:48:34,780 --> 02:48:39,820
games I have to tell you though my experience was a lot different when I

2923
02:48:39,820 --> 02:48:45,900
was you know teenager and young adult in Alabama it was all Mortal Kombat 2 it was

2924
02:48:45,900 --> 02:48:50,500
well because the blood was cool well no it when we did our tournaments at my

2925
02:48:50,500 --> 02:48:53,940
college it was on Killer Instinct we didn't have any Street Fighter machines

2926
02:48:53,940 --> 02:48:57,540
we had a we had a vampire save that would also be the period of time though

2927
02:48:57,540 --> 02:48:59,980
when all the Street Fighter games that were coming out were essentially just

2928
02:48:59,980 --> 02:49:03,900
Street Fighter 2 champions we've had her to churbo Street Fighter 2 super and

2929
02:49:03,900 --> 02:49:08,900
then there was Street Fighter 3 which kind of I mean it was it didn't have

2930
02:49:08,900 --> 02:49:12,700
that same fire under it when it came out but like even my arcade that I worked

2931
02:49:12,700 --> 02:49:15,860
out later than that it was Tekken 3 but then again we were also in Amco arcade

2932
02:49:15,860 --> 02:49:22,460
hmm I'm just saying well I haven't been to a Street Fighter tournament yeah it's

2933
02:49:22,460 --> 02:49:29,060
funny to hear that because um like I like the way the way the way it's

2934
02:49:29,060 --> 02:49:31,820
presented to me and the way I remember from my own youth is that everybody

2935
02:49:31,820 --> 02:49:36,540
gravitated to Street Fighter you know and and it needs to continue that might

2936
02:49:36,540 --> 02:49:41,180
be more of a West Coast thing and it is well it is also I I think if you look at

2937
02:49:41,180 --> 02:49:43,780
the internet and a lot of stuff like a lot of the fighting game stuff on the

2938
02:49:43,780 --> 02:49:47,220
internet I I don't doubt what right steel is saying at all it does seem to

2939
02:49:47,220 --> 02:49:51,460
be heavily dominated with Street Fighter especially the eSports stuff all this

2940
02:49:51,460 --> 02:49:54,500
stuff we're talking about that didn't exist in the area you're talking about

2941
02:49:54,500 --> 02:49:59,660
eSports wasn't a thing back then you know so now that it's even even even

2942
02:49:59,660 --> 02:50:03,940
before eSports like when Mortal Kombat came out I remember a lot of people

2943
02:50:03,940 --> 02:50:09,060
didn't take it seriously and and the post arcade Mortal Kombat they never got

2944
02:50:09,060 --> 02:50:13,100
any tournament play well even though they were popular game Mortal Kombat 3

2945
02:50:13,100 --> 02:50:16,620
is like Mortal Kombat 3 especially was kind of a joke in the fighting game

2946
02:50:16,620 --> 02:50:19,900
community because of all the not just the over-the-top stuff but the combos

2947
02:50:19,900 --> 02:50:24,060
and the the the juggles that go on forever and just kind of the style is so

2948
02:50:24,060 --> 02:50:27,380
much different I remember that game was really not well received by the fighting

2949
02:50:27,380 --> 02:50:32,580
game community you know casual people liked it enough but it's funny you say

2950
02:50:32,580 --> 02:50:37,640
that because because a lot of people you mean that they're huge into the into

2951
02:50:37,640 --> 02:50:42,620
Marvel you know and that's all you know that's all bullshit juggles and 99 hit

2952
02:50:42,620 --> 02:50:46,660
combos that's true all right Ross still I gotta let you know I gotta let you go

2953
02:50:46,660 --> 02:50:49,860
for time but thank you so much for calling in I really appreciate it okay

2959
02:51:10,700 --> 02:51:16,220
next week right that's my response let's go to our Twitter because we got to get

2960
02:51:16,220 --> 02:51:20,580
some of these out real quick here twitter.com slash olr 13x forever tweets

2961
02:51:20,580 --> 02:51:27,500
us saying Loki olr looks much cuter in this picture than I remember them I'm

2962
02:51:27,500 --> 02:51:31,780
not sure how Loki should take that I'm assuming that's the one I'm sure I'm

2963
02:51:31,780 --> 02:51:39,020
assuming it's the geek life one because that's the article we've been we haven't

2964
02:51:39,020 --> 02:51:42,820
we haven't taken new publicity photos in at least like six years cuz that was at

2965
02:51:42,820 --> 02:51:48,140
my like old house so yeah took those pictures no Eddie that was from the

2966
02:51:48,140 --> 02:51:52,180
Eddie set Tia did the very very first one a long time ago that was on that

2967
02:51:52,180 --> 02:51:56,300
mark for a while and Eddie did a set that's right now come here was awful in

2968
02:51:56,300 --> 02:52:01,460
that yeah no I loved it but anyway it was awful I thought you look cute but

2969
02:52:01,460 --> 02:52:04,980
we need new ones we need to find a photographer friend maybe I know a

2970
02:52:04,980 --> 02:52:10,180
couple get some new ones taken and you can see how you can see how cute Loki

2971
02:52:10,180 --> 02:52:16,780
is now it depends on what day you see me like right now I need a haircut and a

2972
02:52:16,780 --> 02:52:24,020
shave all right going to a couple tweets from Tiger claw on Twitter says trials

2973
02:52:24,020 --> 02:52:30,300
evolution popularity is due to true skill according to red links trials

2974
02:52:30,300 --> 02:52:34,660
evolution of course is on the Xbox Live arcade and it set a one-day sales

2975
02:52:34,660 --> 02:52:39,340
record apparently because of how well trials HD had done this is the game

2976
02:52:39,340 --> 02:52:44,020
that's like kinda excite by the bike II at least that's what it is at first look

2977
02:52:44,020 --> 02:52:50,780
let's see what is why why are people loving this so much according to Taro

2978
02:52:50,780 --> 02:52:55,140
virtually who's the managing director at red links I think there is a more

2979
02:52:55,140 --> 02:52:59,140
positive explanation than sheer masochism it's like in real life when you

2980
02:52:59,140 --> 02:53:02,540
start practicing something very physics based like tennis or billiards there's

2981
02:53:02,540 --> 02:53:06,740
no limit how far you can develop your skills in trials is also about your own

2982
02:53:06,740 --> 02:53:11,300
true skill not the skill of your avatar or game character the sense of

2983
02:53:11,300 --> 02:53:15,060
accomplishment is that much more genuine because it was all your own doing your

2984
02:53:15,060 --> 02:53:18,660
skill your persistence and also I believe they are referring to not a

2985
02:53:18,660 --> 02:53:22,180
picture of me but a picture of my cat and yes my cat is much cuter than I am

2986
02:53:22,180 --> 02:53:28,300
that what it is all because you just tweeted a picture your cat I put the cat

2987
02:53:28,300 --> 02:53:33,740
in there for size reference okay see under so it is a large someone asked

2988
02:53:33,740 --> 02:53:37,780
like ready to be sure me I'm like no sure me hasn't moved Loki's house all

2989
02:53:37,780 --> 02:53:45,340
right moving on tiger claw says there's a portal cartoon being made what yeah I

2990
02:53:45,340 --> 02:53:49,420
didn't hear about this there is this a real thing or is this a fan thing I mean

2991
02:53:49,420 --> 02:53:52,100
actually what's a fan thing I shouldn't say it like that it's not like a fan

2992
02:53:52,100 --> 02:53:57,220
thing can't be rushed say is this a officially endorsed thing no but it's

2993
02:53:57,220 --> 02:54:03,220
it's being done by professional animator it's Alex Zemke he worked on or the

2994
02:54:03,220 --> 02:54:07,740
movies called companionship and he is a professional animator who and credits
