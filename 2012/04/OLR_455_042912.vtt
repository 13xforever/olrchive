WEBVTT

00:14.067 --> 00:15.629
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, April 29th, 2012.

00:15.729 --> 00:19.414
[SPEAKER_00]: The release date leaks for one big game this fall.

00:19.714 --> 00:26.142
[SPEAKER_00]: Nintendo will bring retail digital downloads to the Wii U. And could Microsoft be planning another music service?

00:31.733 --> 00:39.301
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to the show where every gamer has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

00:39.802 --> 00:45.328
[SPEAKER_03]: We are live as we are every week at VOG Network.

00:47.610 --> 00:51.512
[SPEAKER_03]: 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

00:51.912 --> 00:54.453
[SPEAKER_03]: You can join us in our chat room at vognetwork.com.

00:54.873 --> 00:57.535
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be talking more about the chat and some of those changes in just a minute.

00:57.655 --> 01:03.637
[SPEAKER_03]: But my name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and lols with my co-host.

01:03.677 --> 01:05.818
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello to the one and only Jamie Summers.

01:06.078 --> 01:06.259
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

01:06.519 --> 01:07.019
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you?

01:07.299 --> 01:07.619
[SPEAKER_10]: Voggy.

01:09.820 --> 01:10.480
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a minute.

01:10.540 --> 01:12.801
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't a station about volcanic fog.

01:13.101 --> 01:15.182
[SPEAKER_03]: Wikipedia told me VOG is volcanic fog.

01:15.222 --> 01:15.682
[SPEAKER_03]: What is this?

01:16.083 --> 01:17.403
[SPEAKER_10]: Wikipedia is wrong.

01:18.744 --> 01:18.984
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:19.044 --> 01:20.584
[SPEAKER_03]: Also say hello to Tech Master Loki.

01:20.705 --> 01:21.025
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

01:21.045 --> 01:21.985
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you doing, Loki?

01:22.145 --> 01:22.625
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm full.

01:22.965 --> 01:23.506
[SPEAKER_03]: You're full.

01:23.606 --> 01:24.426
[SPEAKER_03]: Full of crap.

01:24.646 --> 01:26.587
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the same joke I made with her last week.

01:26.687 --> 01:28.588
[SPEAKER_04]: I just ate a big pizza.

01:29.008 --> 01:31.109
[SPEAKER_10]: I just ate some dried okra.

01:32.109 --> 01:36.732
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have breadsticks staring at me, but I can literally not fit anymore into my stomach.

01:37.113 --> 01:38.894
[SPEAKER_03]: So, some things never change.

01:39.054 --> 01:40.915
[SPEAKER_03]: Some things change, but some things never change.

01:41.316 --> 01:42.476
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I am getting hungry.

01:43.377 --> 01:45.358
[SPEAKER_03]: Just looking at those breadsticks is making me hungry.

01:45.378 --> 01:46.059
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to close this.

01:46.519 --> 01:50.582
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so before we get into our gaming weeks, let's talk about the big obvious thing that's out there.

01:50.882 --> 01:55.906
[SPEAKER_03]: We weren't able to talk about it last week because we were trying to transition from the old Network to...

01:56.386 --> 01:56.646
[SPEAKER_03]: Geek-Life.com

02:17.694 --> 02:18.655
[SPEAKER_03]: Voice of Geeks Network

02:39.753 --> 02:41.754
[SPEAKER_08]: Our eyes are... We started over.

02:41.834 --> 02:42.234
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

02:42.274 --> 02:45.316
[SPEAKER_03]: We are starting over.

02:45.376 --> 02:46.616
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just about Bomani.

02:47.176 --> 02:48.477
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just about games.

02:49.017 --> 02:51.898
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about all things geek is what this station is all about.

02:52.059 --> 02:53.999
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's going to be reflected in the playlist.

02:54.240 --> 02:57.661
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be reflected in the shows that you're going to hear on the network.

02:57.961 --> 03:00.582
[SPEAKER_03]: And most importantly, it's not just a radio network.

03:01.003 --> 03:06.185
[SPEAKER_03]: The VOG Network is going to be a whole website that has other things as well.

03:06.305 --> 03:08.746
[SPEAKER_03]: Forums and other ways to interact online.

03:08.926 --> 03:12.268
[SPEAKER_03]: with folks and some really exciting maybe metagames.

03:12.288 --> 03:15.350
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to spoil too much, but just say there's great things in store for VOG.

03:15.390 --> 03:32.580
[SPEAKER_03]: The site that you see there now at vognetwork.com, kind of a temporary what we call the phase one so that you guys have a way to continue to listen to us and so that way our shows aren't interrupted at all, but the later phases are going to bring more, more shows to the radio network, more things to see and do on the website.

03:33.740 --> 03:34.361
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be great.

03:34.981 --> 03:42.572
[SPEAKER_03]: So go into our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com Let's see, who do I give the first chat comment to tonight?

03:42.632 --> 03:47.238
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to give it to Hecht, who calls VOG the Voice of God Network.

03:47.258 --> 03:47.399
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

03:49.023 --> 03:50.044
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a whole other network.

03:50.845 --> 03:54.047
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that might be, you know, got to go through the religious programming to get that.

03:54.307 --> 03:59.171
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you pay us $50,000, you'll be guaranteed a place in heaven.

03:59.511 --> 04:06.316
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of chat, we're saying goodbye to our old chat room, which was at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

04:07.017 --> 04:09.559
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was Channel Orange Lounge on IRC.

04:09.599 --> 04:10.620
[SPEAKER_03]: We're saying goodbye to that.

04:11.140 --> 04:13.362
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know some people are like, I don't like change.

04:13.402 --> 04:14.543
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do things have to change?

04:15.223 --> 04:41.387
[SPEAKER_03]: but um we wanted to you know for a long time when we were at our old home we had one chat room they had another and things always felt really disconnected and it was it was a little weird so we wanted to make sure this time we did it right and we merge into the general network chat room especially the fact that the shows that are all starting this network have a lot of listener overlap anyway it really made sense to kind of have a central home or a hub for that

04:42.087 --> 04:45.169
[SPEAKER_03]: Our new chat room is Channel VOG.

04:45.509 --> 04:47.050
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still on the Game Search Network.

04:48.010 --> 04:53.673
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to join it really easy using the Java or whatever, the chat client online, just go to vognetwork.com.

04:54.293 --> 04:54.894
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't miss it.

04:54.934 --> 04:55.754
[SPEAKER_03]: It's right in front of your face.

04:55.794 --> 04:57.155
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the biggest thing on the page right now.

04:57.215 --> 05:00.917
[SPEAKER_03]: vognetwork.com and you will see the chat.

05:00.997 --> 05:04.118
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to use vognetwork.com to listen to the station.

05:04.819 --> 05:09.181
[SPEAKER_03]: You have little things that you can copy-paste into Winamp and mobile phones and all that.

05:09.621 --> 05:10.722
[SPEAKER_03]: That is going to be developing

05:11.582 --> 05:12.542
[SPEAKER_03]: all through the coming weeks.

05:13.363 --> 05:15.363
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to put this out there for the podcast listeners.

05:15.964 --> 05:20.065
[SPEAKER_03]: Those that are listening on the podcast, nothing's changed for them.

05:20.105 --> 05:21.766
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just like, oh, hey, another week, another show.

05:21.826 --> 05:22.226
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is.

05:22.286 --> 05:23.586
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sounds the same as it always has.

05:23.927 --> 05:24.827
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the intention.

05:24.867 --> 05:26.427
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not supposed to sound any different to you guys.

05:26.848 --> 05:33.590
[SPEAKER_03]: If you do happen to visit VOG Network during the week, keep in mind we don't have the stream up 24-7 yet.

05:34.370 --> 05:38.272
[SPEAKER_03]: That is part of Phase 2 that's going to be implemented within the next couple weeks.

05:38.352 --> 05:39.032
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be fast.

05:39.312 --> 05:48.318
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just don't want you to be surprised if you go to vognetwork.com and it's not Saturday night or Sunday night, because Saturday is when Understation Live's on, Sunday's when we're on with Bobby, you're not going to hear anything.

05:48.818 --> 05:50.640
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be that way for a couple weeks.

05:50.740 --> 05:56.023
[SPEAKER_03]: We're slowly expanding with the network, and I'm so excited.

05:56.744 --> 05:57.184
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.

05:58.205 --> 06:06.270
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of sitting at the driver's wheel, being part of having created this, getting to steer this site in the direction we want to take it for geeks everywhere.

06:06.830 --> 06:12.574
[SPEAKER_03]: and giving everybody a voice through radio shows, through feature articles, through forums.

06:12.734 --> 06:14.175
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be awesome.

06:14.476 --> 06:15.076
[SPEAKER_03]: So excited.

06:16.017 --> 06:16.277
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

06:16.357 --> 06:23.602
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyhow, let's get back into video games and talk about our gaming week and so forth and the stuff we've been playing in the gaming world this week.

06:23.662 --> 06:24.723
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, how was your gaming week?

06:25.183 --> 06:25.964
[SPEAKER_10]: I ain't played shit.

06:26.124 --> 06:26.564
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm kidding.

06:26.704 --> 06:26.904
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

06:27.585 --> 06:42.013
[SPEAKER_10]: I played WoW, and then I reformatted my hard drive and installed Windows 7, only to find out that I'm missing my entire iTunes collection from about S down, including my ringtones directory.

06:42.373 --> 06:48.077
[SPEAKER_10]: So I've lost most of the ringtones that I've made, including my Doctor Who theme from Season 10, which makes me irritated.

06:48.797 --> 06:50.098
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is the interweb.

06:50.158 --> 06:51.598
[SPEAKER_03]: Surely you can find that in a heartbeat.

06:51.858 --> 06:52.659
[SPEAKER_10]: I made that one.

06:52.859 --> 06:56.140
[SPEAKER_03]: And the VOG Network probably has it in the upcoming playlist.

06:58.401 --> 07:01.423
[SPEAKER_10]: For anyone who I've ever sent those ringtones to, just send them back to me, please.

07:02.043 --> 07:06.505
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, so I played some WoW.

07:07.205 --> 07:08.206
[SPEAKER_10]: I've finally gotten the beta.

07:09.006 --> 07:11.527
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I mean, I had the beta key.

07:11.647 --> 07:13.028
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wasn't beta-ing.

07:13.688 --> 07:14.689
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I am beta-ing.

07:15.209 --> 07:17.670
[SPEAKER_10]: I've made a panda named Sakurina.

07:19.355 --> 07:23.317
[SPEAKER_10]: Every time I try to play my 85s that I transferred over, the game crashes on me.

07:24.298 --> 07:24.598
[SPEAKER_10]: Oops!

07:25.698 --> 07:27.079
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah.

07:28.580 --> 07:38.905
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we were loaned the Tekken Street Fighter poop game because my friend bought it on PS3 and promptly said, this is broken!

07:39.526 --> 07:40.266
[SPEAKER_10]: And loaned it to us.

07:40.988 --> 07:41.909
[SPEAKER_10]: You can play it.

07:42.189 --> 07:42.649
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate it.

07:43.330 --> 07:48.973
[SPEAKER_10]: So we were going to play it, but things have been busy with me trying to do everything.

07:49.174 --> 07:56.238
[SPEAKER_10]: And Tiger Claw, I backed up my entire iTunes directory, let it finish, double checked it, and somehow half of it was still missing.

07:56.478 --> 07:57.199
[SPEAKER_10]: So shut up.

07:58.580 --> 07:59.220
[SPEAKER_03]: You're so nice.

07:59.480 --> 07:59.721
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

08:00.641 --> 08:01.582
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a wonderful person.

08:02.542 --> 08:07.966
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, Tiger Claw had suggested that this is why I make a backup of my entire iTunes library on a second hard drive.

08:08.311 --> 08:08.832
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I did.

08:10.013 --> 08:21.024
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyway, at any rate, it's just been me trying to play catch up and working and I have two more weeks of school.

08:21.805 --> 08:23.427
[SPEAKER_10]: Then I'm going to Disneyland.

08:24.628 --> 08:25.489
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, congrats.

08:25.609 --> 08:27.571
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I could go, but I don't think it's going to work out.

08:27.732 --> 08:28.713
[SPEAKER_03]: This is everything else going on.

08:29.553 --> 08:29.674
Yeah.

08:29.694 --> 08:29.814
Okay.

08:31.480 --> 08:31.941
[SPEAKER_10]: LOL bye.

08:32.401 --> 08:32.641
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

08:32.661 --> 08:32.901
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

08:33.242 --> 08:34.182
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to feature me for me?

08:34.463 --> 08:36.324
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we can talk about that offline.

08:36.344 --> 08:36.665
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

08:37.145 --> 08:37.405
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

08:37.746 --> 08:39.247
[SPEAKER_03]: Techmaster Loki, how was your gaming week?

08:39.267 --> 08:39.647
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you do?

08:40.568 --> 08:42.810
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3.

08:42.990 --> 08:43.791
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty much it.

08:44.574 --> 08:45.234
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

09:05.302 --> 09:16.133
[SPEAKER_04]: I had started it months ago, but I have been continuing on working on my full-size papercraft model of Portal Turret.

09:16.673 --> 09:17.454
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about 3.5 feet tall.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.076
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be 3.5 feet tall when it's done.

09:23.620 --> 09:26.081
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I posted a picture in the chatroom.

09:26.542 --> 09:35.287
[SPEAKER_04]: What I have done so far is pretty much just the two shells of the actual body minus the gun doors on there because those are actually separate pieces.

09:35.488 --> 09:38.950
[SPEAKER_04]: You can actually make it with the guns, but I'm not.

09:39.030 --> 09:40.171
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to keep the doors shut.

09:40.191 --> 09:41.612
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes it easier.

09:41.732 --> 09:48.536
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, we probably should get Ranma to put that to the Tumblr so the podcast listeners can see this thing that you're building.

09:48.556 --> 09:49.397
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

09:49.775 --> 09:50.296
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do that.

10:10.394 --> 10:12.495
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of the least annoying projects, I'm sure.

10:12.515 --> 10:14.455
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just cutting paper.

10:14.475 --> 10:21.857
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's cost me so far like $20, and that's only because I bought the wrong thickness paper at one point.

10:23.177 --> 10:30.359
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's just like cardstock with glue, the special glue, because it's quick-drying and works great.

10:31.519 --> 10:34.080
[SPEAKER_04]: And then just an X-Acto blade and stuff.

10:34.120 --> 10:34.260
[SPEAKER_04]: But

10:35.339 --> 10:36.340
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

10:55.049 --> 10:57.350
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to be just a regular Portal turret.

10:57.450 --> 11:01.353
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be the one from Portal 2 that you save.

11:01.573 --> 11:02.693
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.

11:03.074 --> 11:04.374
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.

11:05.395 --> 11:06.256
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that sounds awesome.

11:06.296 --> 11:07.536
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to see the finished product.

11:08.017 --> 11:08.997
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you'll bring it to the show.

11:09.157 --> 11:10.158
[SPEAKER_03]: I will bring it to the show.

11:10.178 --> 11:10.778
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you will.

11:10.898 --> 11:11.438
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be great.

11:12.299 --> 11:15.361
[SPEAKER_03]: So that whole video content we want to add to VOG eventually.

11:15.701 --> 11:17.522
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll just be a static camera pointing at your Portal gun.

11:17.982 --> 11:18.382
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.

11:18.643 --> 11:19.163
[SPEAKER_03]: Very ominous.

11:19.623 --> 11:27.887
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so on my gaming week, I was reading some of the comments in chat room and earlier somebody had brought up Phantasy Star Online 2 and the whole beta that's going on.

11:28.007 --> 11:31.749
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I was playing that, but I guess it's only in Japanese right now, which stinks.

11:31.809 --> 11:33.870
[SPEAKER_03]: I really want to check that out at some point.

11:34.330 --> 11:37.571
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had a lot of friends beta testing MMOs this week.

11:38.292 --> 11:42.854
[SPEAKER_03]: Guild Wars 2 apparently has got their thing going on for people that pre-purchased the game.

11:43.374 --> 11:46.736
[SPEAKER_03]: If you already gave them your money, you get to play the game a little early.

11:47.317 --> 11:48.638
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like an open beta test.

11:48.658 --> 11:50.619
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, isn't that coming out soon?

11:50.799 --> 11:51.780
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's pretty soon.

11:51.860 --> 11:52.780
[SPEAKER_03]: I am interested in the game.

11:52.880 --> 11:56.863
[SPEAKER_03]: And for those that remember Irene, she used to go by Rice Princess years ago on this show.

11:56.883 --> 11:59.845
[SPEAKER_03]: If you remember Irene, she's really into Guild Wars, especially this new one.

11:59.885 --> 12:02.006
[SPEAKER_03]: And she says the PvP is awesome.

12:02.407 --> 12:04.168
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm curious to check that out.

12:05.248 --> 12:32.713
[SPEAKER_03]: Xtifer from Horde House has been playing Terra which is apparently pretty good you can make some very fancy pants looking characters in Terra so I want to check that out too because the graphics in that look really good but the MMO that's been taking up my week is of course World of Warcraft hello what else but I have been playing some offline games as well on the Xbox 360 and again note the day note the time other big news besides the new network I didn't just beat one game this year you guys I

12:33.573 --> 12:35.474
[SPEAKER_03]: I beat two games this year.

12:35.634 --> 12:36.955
[SPEAKER_03]: Applause, please.

12:37.695 --> 12:37.955
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job.

12:38.776 --> 12:40.557
[SPEAKER_03]: So I beat Mass Effect, right?

12:40.857 --> 12:41.877
[SPEAKER_03]: And the new game I beat?

12:42.458 --> 12:43.338
[SPEAKER_03]: Mass Effect 2.

12:43.738 --> 12:44.579
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations.

12:44.599 --> 12:49.501
[SPEAKER_04]: Your freight train of intimate disappointment is full speed ahead.

12:49.821 --> 12:51.022
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's my quote for you.

12:52.142 --> 12:52.663
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thank you.

12:52.743 --> 12:53.063
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

12:54.640 --> 12:58.523
[SPEAKER_03]: So, of course, the other day, I think that was what, probably Monday?

12:58.603 --> 13:01.965
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but Rob, when are you going to beat a game that came out this year?

13:04.607 --> 13:08.849
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, well, smartass, I just started Mass Effect 3!

13:09.870 --> 13:33.913
[SPEAKER_03]: go figure it was on sale for 40 bucks a couple weeks ago so I picked up a copy of Mass Effect 3 so I had it ready to go and away I went and so I've been playing that a little bit and I gotta say you know just like some things some little things change from Mass Effect 1 to Mass Effect 2 more things change to Mass Effect 3 and I I'm really loving it oh my gosh the story is great there's

13:34.093 --> 13:34.613
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

13:56.193 --> 13:59.255
[SPEAKER_03]: So, it's really cool getting to run into everybody and see them in part three.

13:59.916 --> 14:03.539
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, just the combat is so much better.

14:04.080 --> 14:09.384
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, even though they didn't really change a lot, like, it's still, you know, you have your guns and use your powers.

14:09.865 --> 14:11.666
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything just feels more fluid.

14:11.707 --> 14:12.727
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I can't explain it.

14:12.787 --> 14:14.569
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, and just the graphics are up a notch.

14:14.989 --> 14:15.470
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great.

14:15.570 --> 14:17.452
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm having such a good time with three.

14:17.772 --> 14:19.493
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's the crazy part.

14:20.234 --> 14:27.463
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm playing multiplayer because Mass Effect 3 has a whole multiplayer thing online that you can go in and it's basically, it's all co-op.

14:27.784 --> 14:28.525
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not competitive.

14:28.585 --> 14:32.189
[SPEAKER_03]: You basically do these four-player co-op matches and, you know, it's not...

14:33.197 --> 14:41.563
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not as rich and as full as the main game, but you know that whole thing that apparently every game has to have multiplayer these days, especially if you're EA, right?

14:42.083 --> 14:48.267
[SPEAKER_03]: So Mass Effect now has this multiplayer mode, and it's basically four-player co-op surviving ten waves on a map.

14:48.447 --> 14:53.391
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's ten waves of enemies, but that could be, you know, little enemies, big enemies.

14:53.731 --> 14:56.533
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be hold a point on the map for a minute.

14:56.673 --> 15:02.437
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be go find the different markers on the map and activate the beacons or whatever within a certain amount of time.

15:02.757 --> 15:04.138
[SPEAKER_03]: There are little modes that they put in it.

15:04.558 --> 15:06.578
[SPEAKER_03]: But the fact that it's co-op makes it really interesting.

15:07.579 --> 15:10.620
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, so I've said a lot of great things about Mass Effect 3, right?

15:10.660 --> 15:12.180
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really do truly love this game.

15:12.220 --> 15:20.303
[SPEAKER_03]: And even if the ending blows ass, which I'm fully expecting it to, I've already been set up for disappointment, the experience of getting there is fine.

15:20.544 --> 15:23.965
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like, especially because I bought it on sale, it's been money well spent.

15:24.965 --> 15:27.106
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, even though I bought these games on sale...

15:28.768 --> 15:35.735
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought every single story DLC for Part 2 and I beat all of those as well.

15:36.096 --> 15:41.222
[SPEAKER_03]: Shadow Broker, Arrival, Overlord, Kasumi, Zaid, I played all of it.

15:42.723 --> 15:44.746
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was a very important thing I had to do before I started 3.

15:46.287 --> 16:02.647
[SPEAKER_03]: so speaking of online and DLC here's my problem with Mass Effect 3 and this is a big problem and this is my this is why I'm going to be hesitant to give this my game of the year extremely hesitant to give this my game of the year award and

16:04.651 --> 16:08.592
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically the blatant money grab the EA is going for with this.

16:09.672 --> 16:15.094
[SPEAKER_03]: In multiplayer, you don't level the same character that you level in single player.

16:15.674 --> 16:22.115
[SPEAKER_03]: You level your character in multiplayer, and the way you do that is that you earn credits with every map that you do.

16:22.455 --> 16:25.536
[SPEAKER_03]: The more waves you survive, the more you contribute, the more credits you get.

16:25.556 --> 16:28.877
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you manage to make it all the way to the end and get airlifted out, you get a lot of credits.

16:29.577 --> 16:34.901
[SPEAKER_03]: and you use the credits to buy little boxes that are akin to a Magic the Gathering booster pack.

16:35.281 --> 16:39.004
[SPEAKER_03]: You can buy a cheapy box for $5,000 that'll have cheapy stuff in it.

16:39.344 --> 16:47.090
[SPEAKER_03]: You can buy a slightly better box for $20,000 credits that has better stuff and are rare.

16:47.470 --> 16:52.014
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can buy a jumbo box for $60,000 that has super rare or whatever in it.

16:52.054 --> 16:53.235
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm kind of paraphrasing here.

16:53.795 --> 16:54.956
[SPEAKER_03]: But where am I going with this?

16:55.497 --> 17:02.643
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only can you buy the boxes with in-game credits, but you can buy the boxes with Microsoft Points.

17:03.204 --> 17:06.807
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm assuming on the PlayStation 3, you can buy it with PlayStation Store dollars.

17:07.347 --> 17:11.071
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the PC, I'm sure you can tap into their EA Network and buy them as well.

17:11.651 --> 17:15.455
[SPEAKER_03]: So in other words, you can use money to get ahead in the game.

17:16.095 --> 17:25.845
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing that's a little bit irritating with that is that if you want the A-plus best way to get through the game, you really have to play multiplayer.

17:26.065 --> 17:31.310
[SPEAKER_03]: Because multiplayer ties into this event called galactic readiness that starts at half, 50%.

17:32.091 --> 17:35.073
[SPEAKER_03]: The more you play multiplayer, the more the galactic readiness goes up.

17:35.814 --> 17:50.780
[SPEAKER_03]: technically you can get the best ending if you did everything perfect in Mass Effect 1 everything perfect in Mass Effect 2 like you'd have to use a guide online to do it you would absolutely have to use a guide online in order to be able to do it and never touch multiplayer so in other words

17:51.360 --> 18:12.947
[SPEAKER_03]: if you want the best ending which as I understand there isn't that big of a difference anyway between them but by the time the DLC comes out maybe that'll change if you want the best in single player you have to play multiplayer and real money gives you the edge in order to kind of get there as fast as possible because they didn't already take your money when you bought the game it makes me not want to play

18:13.610 --> 18:14.830
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of shitty.

18:15.710 --> 18:26.173
[SPEAKER_03]: EA, that's why you make gamers so angry that they rigged that poll to go vote you the worst company in America whether you deserved it or not.

18:26.893 --> 18:27.933
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the problem.

18:28.893 --> 18:32.814
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it needs to be called out because guess what, gaming industry?

18:32.934 --> 18:35.155
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't have your cake and eat it too.

18:35.815 --> 18:40.436
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't get to charge people that type of money for a game up front and the additional DLC.

18:41.076 --> 18:43.278
[SPEAKER_03]: and then charge the money for Pokemon packs.

18:44.038 --> 18:44.939
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know what you're saying.

18:44.979 --> 18:46.720
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you don't like it, then don't buy it.

18:46.760 --> 18:47.981
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, it's only going to get worse.

18:48.281 --> 18:48.521
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

18:49.302 --> 18:54.805
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we're going to get into it later, but we've already gotten a glimpse of the future and it's only going to get worse.

18:56.526 --> 19:00.448
[SPEAKER_03]: Acidic Vampire in chat says, yes, but Rob, buying them with money is just an option.

19:00.568 --> 19:04.330
[SPEAKER_03]: If you beat the multiplayer on silver and gold, you will be swimming in credits.

19:04.750 --> 19:05.691
[SPEAKER_03]: And I understand that.

19:06.171 --> 19:11.233
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's some people that aren't going to want to play multiplayer that are going to be tempted to do that to give them an edge.

19:11.353 --> 19:11.574
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

19:11.614 --> 19:13.695
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it ultimately does affect single player.

19:14.135 --> 19:15.315
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate multiplayer.

19:15.335 --> 19:17.697
[SPEAKER_03]: See, that's a poor decision.

19:17.797 --> 19:22.319
[SPEAKER_03]: Any way you slice it, having the multiplayer tie in that close to single player was a poor decision.

19:23.335 --> 19:24.376
[SPEAKER_10]: I really don't want to play it now.

19:24.896 --> 19:28.999
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, honestly, it just has deflated any desire.

19:29.299 --> 19:33.522
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think you're robbing yourself of what is otherwise an excellent story and an excellent game.

19:33.542 --> 19:37.945
[SPEAKER_10]: To be honest, I hate multiplayer games unless they're in the house with me.

19:38.225 --> 19:40.506
[SPEAKER_03]: Technically, you don't have to play multiplayer.

19:40.526 --> 19:41.467
[SPEAKER_03]: You just won't get the best ending.

19:42.407 --> 19:46.369
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, even the best ending, it doesn't even matter because you can actually play multiplayer.

19:46.449 --> 19:50.051
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you wouldn't have to buy those packs necessarily to get the experience that you need.

19:50.471 --> 20:02.397
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, I mean, there's some other games, Saints Row the Third, that just have really shitty DLC that they put out at a really expensive amount of money just so that you get more content to the game.

20:02.817 --> 20:04.078
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just terrible.

20:04.098 --> 20:05.219
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only like 30 minutes.

20:05.519 --> 20:05.579
[SPEAKER_04]: Or...

20:05.999 --> 20:12.444
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, we're teasing that there's a character that you love that we decided, hey, we're going to fuck you guys up and kill him in the very beginning of the game.

20:12.785 --> 20:14.246
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, but he's going to come back, but not really.

20:14.286 --> 20:17.448
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're going to tell you that he's coming back so that you buy this $7 piece of crap.

20:18.069 --> 20:21.532
[SPEAKER_03]: TigerClaw in our chatroom says, you don't need to play multiplayer to get the best ending.

20:21.652 --> 20:26.536
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an app you can download on your iPhone or iPad that will help increase the galactic readiness rating.

20:26.596 --> 20:27.097
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

20:45.277 --> 21:10.585
[SPEAKER_03]: like you you're allowing people to buy a competitive edge when you know people are it's just it leaves a very bad taste in my mouth yeah defend defend Mass Effect all you want it's I still say it's a great game great story awesome characters wonderful gameplay but this is a shitty choice I'm looking at this app now take your galaxy with you wherever you go okay

21:11.277 --> 21:13.137
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the galaxy is in Orion's ball.

21:15.398 --> 21:16.318
[SPEAKER_03]: Orion's necklace.

21:16.358 --> 21:20.939
[SPEAKER_03]: A city vampire also says, technically you could play the multiplayer by yourself to up the galactic readiness.

21:21.319 --> 21:30.521
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but I did two player, which is me and Shane, yesterday, and we survived to wave three, and we were really excited that we got that far.

21:31.902 --> 21:33.362
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I misquoted that.

21:33.742 --> 21:35.423
[SPEAKER_04]: The galaxy is in Orion's belt.

21:35.983 --> 21:37.283
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a while since I saw it in black.

21:37.611 --> 21:42.875
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so all that bitching aside, Mass Effect 3 is still going to be one of the year's best games.

21:43.356 --> 21:45.978
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think, I'm side-eyeing EA.

21:46.258 --> 21:47.299
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking at you, EA.

21:47.359 --> 21:48.379
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a shitty choice.

21:48.820 --> 21:53.243
[SPEAKER_03]: If game designers continue to go down this path, this is what's going to cause the next game crash.

21:53.543 --> 21:53.964
[SPEAKER_03]: Watch.

21:55.873 --> 22:12.607
[SPEAKER_04]: this and the no use thing and everything all these other money grabs gaming companies are trying to do in this economy is gonna tank it this is money grabbing light this is nothing compared to some of the crap they're pulling right now Skylanders Skylanders, I'm telling you right there that right there

22:13.550 --> 22:14.331
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

22:34.028 --> 22:34.428
[SPEAKER_10]: Bitch, please.

23:02.791 --> 23:14.746
[SPEAKER_10]: When the job that you work requires your brain and then you have to use your brain some more, the brain does not have much juice left to think about multiplayer and shooting things.

23:16.689 --> 23:18.331
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even ever want to play WoW.

23:21.034 --> 23:21.354
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

23:22.115 --> 23:24.697
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, that's it for my gaming week, really.

23:24.717 --> 23:25.218
[SPEAKER_03]: Mass Effect 3.

23:25.278 --> 23:27.240
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, I guess I should give one other little shout out.

23:27.460 --> 23:28.040
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick one, guys.

23:28.080 --> 23:29.241
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick one, and then we can get into the news.

23:30.082 --> 23:35.627
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say quickly, I watched a friend of mine last night play Silent Hill Downpour, which is the new Silent Hill game.

23:36.127 --> 23:37.549
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to a friend's house to watch him play it.

23:38.169 --> 23:38.249
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

23:39.250 --> 23:40.770
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

24:04.115 --> 24:30.432
[SPEAKER_03]: but there's a lot of I mean I you can't judge the whole game based off that one like silly part you know otherwise and plus I didn't really spend quality time with it and I wasn't the one playing but look and ambience aside it is it does seem like there's a lot they got right like there were some oh shit moments like there's a part where he's walking across this fallen tree that like you know he might fall at any minute and then he like a twig snaps off the tree and and goes plummeting down you know

24:30.752 --> 24:34.773
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheap ass scares like that that you come to love out of playing these scary video games.

24:35.054 --> 24:36.674
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some cool little things like that.

24:37.614 --> 24:43.236
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't play enough of the game to really tell you if it's worth it or not, but I will tell you my friend seems to be enjoying it.

24:43.737 --> 24:50.419
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not Silent Hill 2 or Silent Hill 3, but let's be real, nothing ever will be.

24:50.779 --> 24:55.761
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit, Silent Hill 2 and 3 that just came out last month isn't Silent Hill 2 and 3 anymore.

24:56.701 --> 25:20.267
[SPEAKER_10]: so if you can let that go I think this is a pretty decent game from what I understand it actually did occur to me there was some other gaming that went on at my house Dan playing through Gradius 3 and me failing miserably at R-Type just saying sorry to hear that sorry to hear that just because I wanted to hear the level 1 music and then when I'm done with level 1 it's kind of like I don't want to play anymore

25:21.710 --> 25:29.854
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, go to our chatroom at vognetwork.com if you want to join us as we are live on this Sunday evening as we will be every week from here on out at the VOG Network.

25:29.934 --> 25:37.357
[SPEAKER_03]: vognetwork.com Looking through some comments in chat, Zether says, I heard the Silent Hill HD collection sucks.

25:37.957 --> 25:38.897
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I heard that too.

25:39.738 --> 25:41.818
[SPEAKER_03]: It did suck, unfortunately.

25:41.978 --> 25:46.079
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I haven't played it myself, but just what I'm reading isn't good.

25:46.299 --> 25:50.981
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, next-gen consoles can't handle last-gen fog.

25:51.441 --> 25:52.501
[SPEAKER_03]: That's ridiculous.

25:52.621 --> 25:55.482
[SPEAKER_03]: Downpour, I watched, played on a PS3, and it had plenty of fog.

25:56.502 --> 25:57.102
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's the thing.

25:57.482 --> 26:01.524
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can't render the fog, then why bother releasing the game?

26:01.724 --> 26:06.645
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like if you can't create an emulator or whatever to run the old code...

26:08.425 --> 26:11.006
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't release a broken game.

26:27.490 --> 26:32.393
[SPEAKER_03]: The parts that I heard, again, in my limited viewing, was decent enough.

26:32.493 --> 26:39.236
[SPEAKER_03]: It was enough of a cop drama TV show mixed with some of the little themes, like the little...

26:41.122 --> 26:46.965
[SPEAKER_03]: That little thing that you hear in the beginning, a little mandolin or whatever, it's enough of those kind of mixed together, it's the elements.

26:47.025 --> 26:52.548
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, if you're going to go into the game going, I just know nothing is going to compare to Akira Yamaoka.

26:52.708 --> 26:54.449
[SPEAKER_03]: This game is never going to compare to Akira Yamaoka.

26:54.469 --> 27:02.053
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're not willing to take those blinders off and go, okay, it's a new game, let's just deal with what it is, I think you're just going to set yourself up for disappointment.

27:02.533 --> 27:04.434
[SPEAKER_03]: So, just kind of want to throw that out there.

27:07.053 --> 27:12.216
[SPEAKER_03]: Nietzsche in our chatroom says, is the original Silent Hill still playable or is it painful to play through?

27:12.636 --> 27:14.838
[SPEAKER_03]: Got a free copy through PlayStation Plus.

27:14.898 --> 27:17.099
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, don't forget it is free on PlayStation Plus.

27:17.139 --> 27:18.160
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to grab it myself.

27:19.200 --> 27:21.221
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a direct port of the PlayStation 1 game.

27:21.281 --> 27:23.843
[SPEAKER_03]: So as I understand, everything should be fine.

27:24.243 --> 27:32.988
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to be up res or any of that stuff besides the very, very, very basic like texture smoothing and some of the things that the PlayStation 3 will do to PS1 classics.

27:33.608 --> 27:47.939
[SPEAKER_03]: um otherwise you're getting a pretty legitimate experience as long as you're willing to play a game with 1997 graphics then you'll be all right you know just keep that in mind it was the game's getting to be almost 15 years old so all right um

27:48.419 --> 27:49.400
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it with our Gaming Weeks.

28:11.474 --> 28:13.735
[SPEAKER_03]: Facebook.com slash VOG Network.

28:14.115 --> 28:15.935
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio is also on Google+.

28:16.075 --> 28:16.796
[SPEAKER_03]: Search for us there.

28:17.176 --> 28:18.796
[SPEAKER_03]: VOG's not there yet, but it will be.

28:19.916 --> 28:23.337
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's it for all the plugs.

28:23.518 --> 28:25.558
[SPEAKER_03]: Please help spread the word about the new network.

28:25.598 --> 28:26.358
[SPEAKER_03]: We so can't wait.

28:26.678 --> 28:33.961
[SPEAKER_03]: And I again really want to thank the folks at geek-life.com for all the work they did in promoting today's launch.

28:34.501 --> 28:36.061
[SPEAKER_03]: Go visit their website and click on ads.

28:37.302 --> 28:38.342
[SPEAKER_03]: It would go a long way.

28:38.382 --> 28:38.822
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you much.

28:39.554 --> 28:40.335
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's move on.

28:40.375 --> 28:42.197
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get into some gaming news this week.

28:42.377 --> 28:43.057
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, start off.

28:43.338 --> 28:54.508
[SPEAKER_04]: So Sony is not one to be outdone by Nintendo in the form of, you know, mascot character battle royale deathmatch or whatever.

28:55.229 --> 29:01.335
[SPEAKER_04]: So now they have the PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, which is coming to the PlayStation 3 this year.

29:01.895 --> 29:02.736
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish it was coming at the beginning.

29:02.756 --> 29:03.357
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be kind of cool.

29:03.957 --> 29:16.125
[SPEAKER_04]: But, um, it's being developed by Superbot, and it features characters from all sorts of different PlayStation franchises, new and old, including, um, Parappa the Rapper was in there, that was kind of cool.

29:16.885 --> 29:19.627
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Kratos... He did study Kung Fu!

29:20.268 --> 29:22.049
[SPEAKER_04]: Kick, punch, it's all in the mind.

29:22.229 --> 29:27.572
[SPEAKER_04]: And they actually took that into account, so he does have some Kung Fu moves that he uses, so... Well, he damn well better.

29:28.093 --> 29:33.096
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, Parappa's lethal move is he gives you the most bitchin' paper cut you've ever had in your life.

29:34.336 --> 29:34.937
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what he does.

29:36.297 --> 29:38.598
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, Sly Cooper is in there.

29:39.659 --> 29:40.439
[SPEAKER_04]: Fat Princess.

29:41.480 --> 29:44.721
[SPEAKER_04]: And also some other characters they were mentioning.

29:46.422 --> 29:49.043
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously Cole from Infamous is probably going to be in there.

29:49.303 --> 29:52.925
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're going to have some characters from Resistance and all sorts of different things.

29:54.446 --> 29:56.026
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looks extremely like...

29:57.307 --> 30:00.289
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think of other big Sony products that they could bring into this game.

30:00.309 --> 30:01.250
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Sackboy, obviously.

30:02.350 --> 30:04.452
[SPEAKER_03]: The little cart dudes from Mod Nation Racers.

30:04.912 --> 30:05.733
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, I don't know.

30:06.093 --> 30:07.534
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the cast of the tester?

30:07.634 --> 30:09.975
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we call Asuka to see if they did any mocap?

30:10.135 --> 30:11.296
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet Tooth was going to be in there.

30:12.757 --> 30:25.127
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things I did like about the game that they kind of showed in the trailers, since this whole thing is kind of like this mashup thing, they have, like, in the background, kind of like two different worlds clashing at the same time.

30:25.587 --> 30:30.251
[SPEAKER_04]: So, like, for example, they all have... It was actually really cool.

30:30.271 --> 30:37.697
[SPEAKER_04]: They had, I think, one of the demons, Hades from God of War, was actually attacking the Patapon.

30:38.417 --> 30:39.438
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was kind of cool.

30:39.498 --> 30:40.698
[SPEAKER_04]: They had that kind of going on there.

30:40.938 --> 30:41.699
[SPEAKER_04]: There was one I saw.

30:41.759 --> 30:49.462
[SPEAKER_04]: It was LittleBigPlanet's world kind of crossed with... What the fuck is their damn... Buzz?

30:50.342 --> 30:51.683
[SPEAKER_04]: The Buzz game?

30:51.723 --> 30:52.563
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the quiz show thing?

30:52.603 --> 30:53.264
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, Buzz.

30:53.664 --> 30:55.244
[SPEAKER_04]: A little host dude.

30:55.545 --> 30:57.345
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I'm wondering if he's a character or something.

30:57.365 --> 30:58.726
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was interesting.

30:59.046 --> 31:01.287
[SPEAKER_04]: But the gameplay itself looks exactly like Smash Bros.

31:01.987 --> 31:03.148
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly like Smash Bros.

31:03.488 --> 31:07.670
[SPEAKER_03]: Have the creators addressed that gigantic pink elephant in the room that...

31:08.070 --> 31:10.534
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, your game looks really damn familiar.

31:10.654 --> 31:12.578
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I've seen this somewhere before.

31:14.730 --> 31:14.930
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

31:17.072 --> 31:18.072
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't seem like they have.

31:18.112 --> 31:21.755
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's going to play a little bit different, but damn, does it look like Smash Brothers.

31:21.875 --> 31:23.216
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's the question.

31:23.436 --> 31:26.498
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, is it okay what they're doing?

31:26.978 --> 31:32.522
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, I kind of go, well, there's several different basketball games that come out.

31:32.562 --> 31:33.382
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's fine.

31:33.443 --> 31:34.964
[SPEAKER_03]: All these dance games that come out.

31:34.984 --> 31:35.864
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like fighting games.

31:35.924 --> 31:38.586
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, all the fighting games are pretty similar.

31:38.726 --> 31:39.386
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, that's true.

31:39.427 --> 31:44.270
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's, I think, enough different with it that it'll be, you know, its own thing.

31:45.511 --> 31:45.891
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

31:47.312 --> 31:51.035
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, one of the things people are going to think of is, wow, this really looks like Smash Bros.

31:51.255 --> 31:52.276
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that could be good or bad.

31:52.376 --> 31:52.736
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

31:53.456 --> 31:56.359
[SPEAKER_10]: Did people call out Smash Bros.

31:56.459 --> 32:00.101
[SPEAKER_10]: for having the four-player thing like Power Stone?

32:01.122 --> 32:06.466
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, even if Power Stone was full layout, and not the semi-2D...

32:08.227 --> 32:24.600
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Zether in the chatroom says Nintendo should sue, but RawSteelUT in our chatroom at VOGnetwork.com follows that up with, well, but hold on, because, you know, um, Smash Brothers wasn't really the first game to do it either, and links to a game called The Outfoxies.

32:25.615 --> 32:31.699
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I don't remember this game at all, but certainly there's probably older games in the past that were similar.

32:31.839 --> 32:35.020
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember playing one on the DS that was very similar.

32:35.040 --> 32:36.381
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that would be after Smash Bros.

32:36.421 --> 32:36.982
[SPEAKER_03]: in the 64.

32:37.042 --> 32:43.565
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the Top Trumps, or not Top Trumps, it was all the comic characters.

32:43.625 --> 32:46.587
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and Snake from Metal Gear was in it.

32:46.947 --> 32:48.508
[SPEAKER_03]: I played it at a comic convention once.

32:49.149 --> 32:52.671
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a game on the DS that was total just like it, and it existed.

32:53.391 --> 32:55.172
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it was a Shonen Jump game.

32:55.192 --> 32:56.333
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it was, not Top Trumps.

32:56.353 --> 32:57.394
[SPEAKER_04]: That would have been really boring.

32:58.174 --> 32:59.335
[SPEAKER_11]: Top Trumps is a card game.

32:59.475 --> 33:01.417
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that, but it was Shonen Jump.

33:01.957 --> 33:03.698
[SPEAKER_04]: It was their game that they had.

33:05.219 --> 33:09.783
[SPEAKER_03]: Bob Coffee in our chatroom says, Smash for N64 came out before Power Stone, if I recall.

33:09.823 --> 33:10.323
[SPEAKER_10]: That is true.

33:10.523 --> 33:11.084
[SPEAKER_03]: That is true.

33:11.904 --> 33:15.987
[SPEAKER_10]: And Power Stone actually was full-on 3D rotational everything.

33:16.427 --> 33:18.329
[SPEAKER_03]: Several folks in our chatroom all jumping in there.

33:18.369 --> 33:20.050
[SPEAKER_03]: Jump All-Stars is the game I'm trying to think of.

33:20.510 --> 33:21.771
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, this type of thing.

33:21.931 --> 33:24.354
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was the Ninja Turtles game on GameCube.

33:24.674 --> 33:29.278
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been some other kind of heavily inspired, shall we say, by Smash Bros.

33:30.379 --> 33:40.007
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta say, as much as I kind of chuckle at this game being heavily inspired, shall we say, by what Nintendo's got going on, I want to play it.

33:40.648 --> 33:41.609
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks pretty cool.

33:42.329 --> 33:46.373
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the fact that it'll be HD and it's gonna get online right.

33:49.225 --> 33:51.387
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess Smash Bros.

33:51.687 --> 33:54.169
[SPEAKER_03]: Melee did as well as it could with the online.

33:54.789 --> 33:58.092
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking this has got to be coming out for the Vita.

33:58.372 --> 33:58.832
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

33:59.333 --> 34:03.656
[SPEAKER_04]: I would think it would be a mistake not to put it out on the Vita, especially it's something...

34:04.176 --> 34:10.958
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, although, maybe the reason it's not coming on the Vita is because they really have issues with doing network play.

34:11.238 --> 34:17.919
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's like, well, you can do it via Wi-Fi or you can do this asynchronous multiplayer bullshit.

34:17.959 --> 34:20.820
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't Street Fighter X Tekken, isn't that going to be PS3 and Vita?

34:20.920 --> 34:23.361
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it is going to be, yeah.

34:24.461 --> 34:28.442
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, you know, Capcom's had more experience working on the PlayStation 3.

34:29.178 --> 34:32.080
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why they couldn't add certain features to the Xbox version.

34:32.640 --> 34:35.642
[SPEAKER_03]: ShadowNextGen in our chat says, Sky, this is a PS3 game.

34:35.662 --> 34:38.404
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no guarantee that online will be done right.

34:38.824 --> 34:41.086
[SPEAKER_03]: That may be true, but I'm sorry.

34:41.146 --> 34:44.528
[SPEAKER_03]: I give Sony more credit than I give Nintendo when it comes to doing online right.

34:44.548 --> 34:47.030
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I would trust them with online better than Nintendo.

34:47.050 --> 34:48.431
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, Smash Bros.

34:48.491 --> 34:52.834
[SPEAKER_03]: Melee probably did a hell of a lot better than any other Nintendo game before it as far as online goes.

34:53.294 --> 34:57.277
[SPEAKER_03]: But keep in mind, Nintendo had that whole friend code garbage you had to work with.

34:57.337 --> 34:58.898
[SPEAKER_03]: So that didn't make anything fun.

34:59.798 --> 35:02.520
[SPEAKER_03]: So, all right.

35:02.901 --> 35:06.323
[SPEAKER_03]: So, anyhow, again, if you want to join our chatroom, vognetwork.com.

35:06.363 --> 35:08.065
[SPEAKER_03]: Meanwhile, let's go to some other gaming news.

35:08.965 --> 35:10.766
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a little bit of a surprise.

35:12.127 --> 35:14.529
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not because it's always about patents.

35:14.589 --> 35:22.035
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, patent – I get the sense that patent laws in this country are going to be headed somewhere different soon, especially you hear –

35:22.555 --> 35:24.776
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just so much in the news about like what, Twitter?

35:25.256 --> 35:25.977
[SPEAKER_03]: Was it Twitter?

35:26.197 --> 35:30.558
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of them acquired all these patents and said that they're only using them defensively.

35:30.899 --> 35:33.900
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't plan to use ever like sue for patent or whatever.

35:33.920 --> 35:39.002
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you have Facebook suing Yahoo and Yahoo suing Facebook and all this stuff over patents.

35:39.342 --> 35:43.944
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean the money that's getting sucked away into all this is just amazing.

35:44.364 --> 35:47.726
[SPEAKER_03]: And here we have another result of the whole patent warfare.

35:48.306 --> 36:08.767
[SPEAKER_03]: The Xbox 360 has been found infringing on four patents that were owned by Motorola According to the website The Verge, the patents that were in question deal with the video codec, the H.264 That is also going on with some other legal proceedings with Microsoft and Motorola right now

36:09.247 --> 36:11.628
[SPEAKER_03]: The other two are about Wi-Fi technology.

36:11.948 --> 36:16.751
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also a fifth patent about communication between the Xbox and its accessories.

36:17.171 --> 36:20.493
[SPEAKER_03]: However, one of the Wi-Fi patents was found not infringed.

36:20.833 --> 36:24.234
[SPEAKER_03]: And one claim regarding one of the video patents was invalid.

36:24.715 --> 36:27.476
[SPEAKER_03]: But some were found to be valid.

36:27.936 --> 36:33.379
[SPEAKER_03]: So Microsoft is seeking to force Motorola to license its standard patents forever.

36:33.779 --> 36:36.781
[SPEAKER_03]: under more fair and reasonable terms.

36:37.121 --> 36:41.763
[SPEAKER_03]: But this original ruling by the judge is a bit of a blow on Microsoft's effort.

36:42.124 --> 36:46.186
[SPEAKER_03]: However, as most things in the legal system, appeal, appeal, appeal.

36:46.226 --> 36:48.267
[SPEAKER_03]: And the appeal step is a panel of six judges.

36:48.287 --> 36:53.310
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say that they're also suing... I want to say that they're suing Apple, too.

36:53.610 --> 36:57.512
[SPEAKER_04]: It was some other big company that Motorola was going after.

36:58.352 --> 36:59.253
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was Apple.

37:00.720 --> 37:03.381
[SPEAKER_10]: When Zether and our... Didn't Motorola used to make Apple's processors?

37:04.641 --> 37:07.182
[SPEAKER_03]: All the tech companies have helped each other and then stabbed each other in the back.

37:07.742 --> 37:08.382
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.

37:08.482 --> 37:10.162
[SPEAKER_03]: Zether and her term says patent trolling.

37:10.843 --> 37:16.804
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually I reserve the term patent troll for a company that exists to do nothing but this.

37:18.624 --> 37:21.765
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're talking Motorola and Microsoft.

37:21.945 --> 37:23.346
[SPEAKER_03]: They're both really big companies.

37:23.406 --> 37:24.686
[SPEAKER_03]: Motorola makes lots of phones.

37:25.006 --> 37:26.886
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if I'd call them a patent troll.

37:27.267 --> 37:28.687
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just patent warfare.

37:29.207 --> 37:30.408
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Apple, by the way.

37:47.523 --> 37:49.323
[SPEAKER_03]: They've tried to become a bit of a portal.

37:49.623 --> 37:53.984
[SPEAKER_03]: They have their Yahoo Mail, but they haven't really been able to break through.

37:54.324 --> 37:56.425
[SPEAKER_03]: Google kind of stomped on them and so forth.

37:56.485 --> 37:57.945
[SPEAKER_03]: I still use Yahoo here and there.

37:57.985 --> 38:01.806
[SPEAKER_03]: They're a good portal, but they're struggling, and they've had to lay a lot of people off.

38:02.446 --> 38:03.566
[SPEAKER_03]: So what did Yahoo do?

38:03.646 --> 38:15.428
[SPEAKER_03]: They sued Facebook over 10 patents that Yahoo had, and a lot of it tied into, I think, the My Yahoo that they tried to develop that has a lot of aggregate feed type stuff that Facebook also does, to kind of put it in a nutshell.

38:16.509 --> 38:17.850
[SPEAKER_03]: So what did Facebook do in return?

38:18.231 --> 38:20.313
[SPEAKER_03]: Sued Yahoo right back over other patents.

38:20.753 --> 38:22.655
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just patent warfare.

38:22.775 --> 38:26.599
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to say it's patent trolling, but it's clear that Yahoo's struggling.

38:26.999 --> 38:32.164
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is something that they're doing to try and kind of get themselves back up a little bit.

38:32.425 --> 38:33.826
[SPEAKER_10]: Or maybe just try to stay relevant.

38:34.767 --> 38:35.528
[SPEAKER_03]: In a way, maybe.

38:35.948 --> 38:39.110
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I found the other one, and actually it is Apple.

38:41.011 --> 38:46.635
[SPEAKER_10]: It's for a patent for noise elimination and other interference during voice and data transmission.

38:48.896 --> 38:52.398
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, does this mean the Xbox 360 is going to suddenly stop being sold?

38:52.798 --> 38:53.859
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of doubt that.

38:54.259 --> 38:56.400
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gone a little far at this point.

38:56.741 --> 38:59.622
[SPEAKER_03]: But could Microsoft end up having to pay huge amounts of money to Motorola?

39:00.003 --> 39:03.885
[SPEAKER_03]: Could they have to agree to some pretty hefty terms for the technology?

39:04.305 --> 39:05.406
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's possible.

39:05.746 --> 39:08.989
[SPEAKER_04]: Could they perhaps not put Rumble in their next console?

39:09.009 --> 39:11.150
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's not really that important anyways.

39:11.170 --> 39:13.052
[SPEAKER_04]: It has nothing to do with the fact that they infringed on patents.

39:13.072 --> 39:13.872
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, remember all that?

39:13.892 --> 39:15.393
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's a great comparison.

39:15.453 --> 39:16.014
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that?

39:16.074 --> 39:18.476
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why you didn't have Rumble in the original PlayStation 3.

39:18.516 --> 39:20.777
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it wasn't because they were infringing on patents.

39:20.838 --> 39:23.640
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because it wasn't important until they decided to put it in there.

39:23.660 --> 39:25.001
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sure, sure, whatever.

39:25.121 --> 39:25.321
[SPEAKER_03]: Not bad.

39:25.441 --> 39:25.882
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

39:25.922 --> 39:29.207
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the fact that they got sued over the PlayStation 2 controllers.

39:29.247 --> 39:31.430
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it wasn't important right then.

39:32.171 --> 39:33.433
[SPEAKER_03]: It became important later.

39:33.673 --> 39:35.696
[SPEAKER_03]: Six Axis was the future of gaming.

39:35.736 --> 39:37.820
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the last game that used Six Axis?

39:39.818 --> 39:41.620
[SPEAKER_10]: Six Axis was a pain in the ass.

39:42.200 --> 39:45.603
[SPEAKER_10]: I know the last thing that I played that included it was Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

39:46.664 --> 39:47.184
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that was it.

39:47.204 --> 39:48.546
[SPEAKER_03]: That game's a few years old.

39:48.706 --> 39:52.849
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's still some games that use it, but man, it's not something that they're like, hey.

39:52.929 --> 39:55.732
[SPEAKER_03]: Little Big Planet is one of the last ones I can think of that uses it.

39:56.632 --> 39:59.834
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah, Six Axes.

40:00.714 --> 40:02.135
[SPEAKER_04]: You can use that as a steering wheel, right?

40:03.916 --> 40:05.356
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it works great, too.

40:05.756 --> 40:06.457
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

40:06.697 --> 40:08.217
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why I still have a NegCon.

40:08.318 --> 40:09.978
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say, actually, I thought of it.

40:10.719 --> 40:12.840
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a Six Axes game that was pretty bitchin'.

40:13.220 --> 40:13.520
[SPEAKER_03]: Flower.

40:15.669 --> 40:19.050
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like the only six axis game I can sit here and say I truly enjoyed it.

40:19.270 --> 40:21.951
[SPEAKER_04]: I can use it to slightly adjust the camera in Journey.

40:24.572 --> 40:26.233
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on with more news.

40:27.593 --> 40:30.134
[SPEAKER_10]: How about something that doesn't have to do with a really crappy controller?

40:31.114 --> 40:31.615
[SPEAKER_03]: How about it?

40:31.875 --> 40:32.835
[SPEAKER_10]: How about some Call of Duty?

40:35.014 --> 40:35.574
[SPEAKER_10]: How about it?

40:35.655 --> 40:36.355
[SPEAKER_10]: Bang, bang, bang.

40:36.735 --> 40:41.359
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the release date for Call of Duty Black Ops 2 has been leaked.

40:41.759 --> 40:44.161
[SPEAKER_10]: Which I don't know if it was on purpose or not.

40:44.601 --> 40:48.484
[SPEAKER_10]: I love when they say leaked, but you don't really know.

40:49.145 --> 40:49.425
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

40:50.666 --> 40:56.210
[SPEAKER_10]: So there was an image of the PS3 and Xbox 360 pre-order cards for Target.

40:56.991 --> 40:59.032
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was posted by IGN earlier.

40:59.493 --> 41:01.354
[SPEAKER_10]: This says it's going to be on November 13th.

41:03.619 --> 41:06.221
[SPEAKER_10]: So, we have a shake of the head.

41:06.962 --> 41:07.282
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki?

41:07.322 --> 41:08.003
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're guessing.

41:08.724 --> 41:09.544
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing's been announced.

41:09.985 --> 41:14.949
[SPEAKER_04]: They're seriously guessing because I don't even think the game's going to be called Black Ops 2, to be honest.

41:15.430 --> 41:20.094
[SPEAKER_04]: Because they've registered trademarks for Eclipse, Call of Duty Eclipse.

41:20.594 --> 41:29.242
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're guessing because already in blogs, like Kotaku and some other places, they've speculated that it's going to be on the 13th because there happens to be a full...

41:29.762 --> 41:36.924
[SPEAKER_04]: Lunar Eclipse, or Solar Eclipse actually on that date, which also happens to fall on a Tuesday during November.

41:37.024 --> 41:41.986
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a fucking election, presidential election happening the same day as the Halo release date.

41:42.166 --> 41:42.926
[SPEAKER_03]: To continue.

41:42.946 --> 41:44.167
[SPEAKER_03]: Solar Eclipses don't matter.

41:44.707 --> 41:50.268
[SPEAKER_10]: There was indication first of a Black Ops sequel with an Amazon France listing that got pulled.

41:51.389 --> 41:54.710
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's supposed to be actual news coming out on this on May 1st.

41:55.629 --> 42:14.443
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other reason I call bullshit on this too is because Call of Duty, they're using the Roman numerals for Black Ops 2 when it's most likely they normally just use actual numbers for their titles.

42:14.563 --> 42:16.044
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't think it's going to be Black Ops.

42:16.104 --> 42:17.646
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that they're just guessing.

42:17.766 --> 42:21.408
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's it really going to hurt if they have some sort of...

42:23.830 --> 42:27.434
[SPEAKER_04]: Pre-order card or whatever to get people excited about a new Call of Duty game.

42:27.975 --> 42:29.256
[SPEAKER_04]: So what if it ends up being something else?

42:29.276 --> 42:30.517
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll just have to reprint cards.

42:30.978 --> 42:33.880
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're going to find out soon enough.

42:34.101 --> 42:37.344
[SPEAKER_10]: If they've got a card dated with it though.

42:37.544 --> 42:41.268
[SPEAKER_10]: If you think about the cost of printing and on a national scale...

42:42.529 --> 42:44.791
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait a minute, wait a minute.

42:45.331 --> 42:52.917
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you saying that Target would just put a release date in their system and then put these fake things on the shelves to entice people to pre-order?

42:53.238 --> 42:56.380
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never heard of that done before in the gaming retail industry.

42:56.480 --> 43:01.384
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not like that big major changes have not been wrong, you know, in printed marketing material.

43:01.404 --> 43:03.186
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, for example... It doesn't really matter.

43:03.586 --> 43:04.327
[SPEAKER_04]: According to Best Buy...

43:04.927 --> 43:05.987
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, shit.

43:06.348 --> 43:07.968
[SPEAKER_04]: Diablo 3 should have been out months ago.

43:07.988 --> 43:12.430
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a minute, that was one Best Buy in like Wisconsin or something.

43:12.510 --> 43:17.292
[SPEAKER_10]: In the whole thing, it doesn't really matter because they're making an announcement on it in three days.

43:18.032 --> 43:19.713
[SPEAKER_10]: So, again, does it matter?

43:20.293 --> 43:20.473
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

43:21.214 --> 43:22.274
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's all about firsties.

43:22.334 --> 43:26.676
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all about who did it first, who called it first, and because that's why we have the whole patent wars.

43:26.776 --> 43:29.097
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's a whole big pile of who gives a shit.

43:30.690 --> 43:44.200
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so that all these websites can go exclusive exclusive release date exclusive pictures of the exclusive exclusiving exclusive that we have You know what an actual exclusive is?

43:44.860 --> 43:48.163
[SPEAKER_10]: Is if the company went to hey hey IGN

43:48.743 --> 43:52.644
[SPEAKER_10]: We want you to have the date officially from us.

43:53.144 --> 43:54.225
[SPEAKER_10]: That's an exclusive.

43:54.665 --> 43:58.186
[SPEAKER_10]: Getting it off of a card from a target.

43:58.346 --> 44:03.047
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean like certain radio entrepreneurs may have gone to a geeky website to give them the exclusive on what was happening?

44:03.067 --> 44:03.567
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

44:03.827 --> 44:08.749
[SPEAKER_10]: When they come to you and say, we want you to do it first because you've been good to us.

44:09.409 --> 44:37.226
[SPEAKER_03]: but if I use the word exclusive as much as exclusively possible in my article then I'll get more hits and I'll get to go to E3 because that's what this industry's turned into exclusive Jamie shut her mouth for the first time here on Orange Lounge Radio that's a Rob Roberts exclusive actions speak louder than words and none of you can see this action and I'm getting the finger

44:37.631 --> 44:39.432
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yeah, it's a good guess.

44:39.532 --> 44:42.833
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, obviously they're not going to launch the same day as Halo.

44:43.594 --> 44:51.377
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's typically the second Tuesday of November that they normally launch Call of Duty.

44:51.417 --> 44:54.418
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, it's a good guess.

44:55.278 --> 44:56.639
[SPEAKER_04]: And they could be right.

44:56.699 --> 44:57.879
[SPEAKER_09]: I was not purring.

44:58.660 --> 45:02.822
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's only like one in four shot of being correct.

45:02.842 --> 45:02.962
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

45:03.002 --> 45:03.122
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

45:05.876 --> 45:08.658
[SPEAKER_04]: We're actually one and two because it's going to be in the beginning of the month.

45:08.718 --> 45:14.562
[SPEAKER_03]: They might have to recall all those cards or in the great retail big box way, get a big black marker.

45:16.243 --> 45:17.004
[SPEAKER_03]: Get the new guy.

45:17.244 --> 45:19.226
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, new guy, take this giant stack of 500 cards.

45:19.246 --> 45:24.970
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to take this Sharpie and everywhere you see a 13, you're going to write a 20.

45:27.171 --> 45:28.172
[SPEAKER_03]: You think you can do that?

45:28.672 --> 45:29.613
[SPEAKER_09]: When do I get my break?

45:29.813 --> 45:30.934
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not how it works.

45:32.659 --> 45:34.160
[SPEAKER_10]: They'd have to pay that guy more.

45:35.061 --> 45:40.404
[SPEAKER_10]: To be honest, for the time that it would take him to do all that, then it would just be to print up 50,000 new cards.

45:41.545 --> 45:43.486
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I go on a tangent?

45:43.906 --> 45:45.187
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a VOG tangent.

45:45.487 --> 45:47.008
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we don't do tangents on this show.

45:47.048 --> 45:48.569
[SPEAKER_03]: I want our first VOG tangent.

45:48.890 --> 45:50.351
[SPEAKER_09]: We already had one of those, Rob.

45:50.551 --> 45:51.651
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Okra.

45:52.252 --> 45:54.754
[SPEAKER_03]: I went grocery shopping with Alan yesterday.

45:54.774 --> 45:55.894
[SPEAKER_03]: We went to the grocery store.

45:56.535 --> 45:57.515
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, right?

45:57.916 --> 45:58.436
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, right?

45:58.936 --> 46:00.157
[SPEAKER_03]: So we went to the grocery store.

46:00.177 --> 46:01.078
[SPEAKER_11]: Exclusive Rob went shopping.

46:04.979 --> 46:08.100
[SPEAKER_03]: And we bought probably like, I don't know, $120 worth of groceries.

46:08.280 --> 46:08.740
[SPEAKER_03]: Exclusive!

46:09.280 --> 46:11.641
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks to couponing, I got it down to $115.

46:12.901 --> 46:14.462
[SPEAKER_11]: But anyway... How very Dutch of you.

46:14.522 --> 46:17.503
[SPEAKER_11]: The point is... Well, it is in my heritage.

46:17.883 --> 46:19.843
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, we get the cart.

46:19.883 --> 46:23.404
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how you take the cart up to the little thing and you put everything up on the conveyor belt, right?

46:24.044 --> 46:25.225
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the employees...

46:25.945 --> 46:26.866
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

46:44.722 --> 46:48.203
[SPEAKER_03]: But it does kind of make me go, gosh, I feel really fucking lazy.

46:48.283 --> 46:52.805
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, is everybody else in the grocery store just watching this poor grocery clerk do this for me?

46:52.845 --> 46:57.827
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I was in a wheelchair or had a cast on or something, I could understand why they do that.

46:57.887 --> 47:01.288
[SPEAKER_03]: But Alan and I are both perfectly healthy individuals.

47:01.768 --> 47:02.728
[SPEAKER_03]: Exclusive.

47:02.748 --> 47:03.609
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob and Alan are healthy.

47:05.776 --> 47:06.657
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet she was doing it.

47:06.717 --> 47:11.220
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, well, thank you for loading the groceries on the conveyor belt.

47:11.921 --> 47:13.262
[SPEAKER_03]: So whatever do we owe this?

47:13.362 --> 47:14.483
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't usually see this.

47:14.543 --> 47:18.426
[SPEAKER_03]: And she said, well, we're really overstaffed right now.

47:18.466 --> 47:20.928
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a lot of new people that just started today.

47:21.008 --> 47:22.309
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have so many people.

47:22.389 --> 47:24.291
[SPEAKER_03]: She's like, I was just here.

47:24.351 --> 47:25.352
[SPEAKER_03]: I needed something to do.

47:26.373 --> 47:29.755
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's like, I spent all morning in the produce department just arranging things.

47:30.416 --> 47:31.337
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm thinking to myself...

47:33.138 --> 47:40.239
[SPEAKER_03]: and I'm thinking to myself apples and bananas as much as I appreciate that she has a job she has good employment so that

47:41.756 --> 47:42.517
[SPEAKER_03]: Offer his union.

47:42.577 --> 47:43.717
[SPEAKER_03]: See if she wants to go home.

47:44.158 --> 47:44.738
[SPEAKER_03]: She's union.

47:45.899 --> 47:46.739
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a union thing?

47:47.520 --> 47:49.781
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even think of that, but you're probably right.

47:50.022 --> 47:57.246
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep in mind, I worked for a grocery store for all of three freaking days, and I quit after the old man tried to be a bitch to me, and I told him he couldn't buy his beer.

47:57.266 --> 47:59.468
[SPEAKER_10]: I haven't said that story on the air, have I?

48:00.449 --> 48:11.456
[SPEAKER_10]: But I know that you got guaranteed a certain number of hours, and you got guaranteed this, and if you were scheduled to work, you had to work, and this crap.

48:12.817 --> 48:15.778
[SPEAKER_03]: AcidicVampire in chat says, that's like someone pumping your gas.

48:16.839 --> 48:17.179
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon.

48:17.519 --> 48:19.440
[SPEAKER_03]: It did feel very Jersey or Oregon.

48:19.480 --> 48:20.001
[SPEAKER_03]: Take your pick.

48:20.561 --> 48:30.566
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I have to tell you one thing, and this just goes from my childhood and visiting my granny in Dothan, Alabama, that we would go to the Piggly Wiggly.

48:31.827 --> 48:32.128
[SPEAKER_10]: I know.

48:32.448 --> 48:33.969
[SPEAKER_03]: Best name for a grocery store ever.

48:35.071 --> 48:36.853
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go get pork at the Piggly Wiggly.

48:37.934 --> 48:50.487
[SPEAKER_10]: And they had these type of conveyor belts that the back end of your buggy would unlatch and it would push right up to the belt and then the cashier would unload for you.

48:50.587 --> 48:51.949
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, they used to have those here too.

48:52.569 --> 48:55.930
[SPEAKER_10]: There were those kind of tall, flat, flatter type of buggies.

48:56.090 --> 48:59.552
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the old Raleys here still had that where you just push, you don't even have a conveyor belt.

48:59.572 --> 49:04.634
[SPEAKER_03]: You push the cart right up to the counter and then they open the front of it and just pull everything off of it and go over the standard.

49:04.654 --> 49:05.834
[SPEAKER_10]: Which I think is great.

49:05.934 --> 49:06.514
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I do too.

49:06.955 --> 49:12.897
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, but now it's, you know, I also hate self-service.

49:13.658 --> 49:21.126
[SPEAKER_03]: and then, well, yeah, I was going to say, Ross DLUT in our VOG chat room says, here in Florida, we got Winn-Dixie's with the self-checkout counters.

49:21.166 --> 49:28.634
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we have that too, but when you're buying like $120 worth of groceries, I don't want to use the self, because those things are a pain in the ass.

49:28.954 --> 49:31.256
[SPEAKER_10]: Old school Winn-Dixies, by the way, had the old style thing, too.

49:31.296 --> 49:44.506
[SPEAKER_03]: The self-checkouts are great for when you need just a pint of ice cream and Doritos, but when you're buying legit groceries for the week with produce and everything, you don't... No, I would not use the self-checkout.

49:44.546 --> 49:45.327
[SPEAKER_03]: It would take forever.

49:45.747 --> 49:46.688
[SPEAKER_03]: I have an expert do it.

49:48.149 --> 49:48.449
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow.

49:50.602 --> 49:52.464
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone's talking about what their grocery stores are.

49:52.504 --> 49:52.765
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

49:53.846 --> 49:56.388
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the most the chat room's talked about all night.

49:56.408 --> 49:58.350
[SPEAKER_03]: Perhaps we should become a grocery store podcast.

49:58.951 --> 50:03.436
[SPEAKER_03]: Nietzsche in our chat says, Here in Kansas, your groceries are always bagged and sometimes carried to your vehicle.

50:03.516 --> 50:04.357
[SPEAKER_03]: No questions asked.

50:04.457 --> 50:04.997
[SPEAKER_10]: Rayleigh's here.

50:05.518 --> 50:05.918
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that.

50:05.958 --> 50:08.020
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they always ask, but I'm always like, no, no, no.

50:08.080 --> 50:09.522
[SPEAKER_10]: But the thing is, they're required to do it.

50:09.542 --> 50:10.183
[SPEAKER_10]: It's part of their job.

50:10.383 --> 50:10.583
Really?

50:10.723 --> 50:11.103
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it is.

50:11.503 --> 50:12.584
[SPEAKER_10]: So Dan and I have them do it.

50:12.964 --> 50:15.685
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, if I'm buying ice cream and Doritos, I don't want to help out.

50:15.705 --> 50:17.666
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, if you're buying two things, that's one thing.

50:17.706 --> 50:24.089
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you're getting all your groceries for the week or for the month or whatever, then it's kind of nice.

50:24.469 --> 50:25.289
[SPEAKER_10]: It's part of their job.

50:25.369 --> 50:27.971
[SPEAKER_10]: It's what they're supposed to do.

50:28.351 --> 50:32.753
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, we asked one of them flat out, do you really mind doing this?

50:33.553 --> 50:34.714
[SPEAKER_10]: I like getting out and getting some air.

50:35.234 --> 50:37.355
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I want all those grapes individually bagged.

50:39.645 --> 50:42.447
[SPEAKER_03]: I need you to go through this bag of M&M's and pick out the green ones.

50:42.947 --> 50:47.931
[SPEAKER_10]: Now DJ Morpheus in chat is saying that's the Rob Roberts diet ice cream and Doritos.

50:47.991 --> 50:49.072
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's your family crest.

50:49.972 --> 51:04.282
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a big bag of Doritos with big pulps of ice cream coming out of the top of it and like Hello Kitty over the bag of Doritos and the word penis or something.

51:04.383 --> 51:04.803
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

51:07.338 --> 51:14.442
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so in great internet fashion, we have apparently dropped this for the podcast listeners.

51:14.742 --> 51:16.323
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to reconnect to the feed right now.

51:16.643 --> 51:18.685
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope this isn't a repeat of what happened last week.

51:18.725 --> 51:19.905
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be most unfortunate.

51:20.526 --> 51:21.806
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think Comcast is anything.

51:21.866 --> 51:23.928
[SPEAKER_03]: It is trying to reconnect right now, and there it is.

51:23.968 --> 51:24.968
[SPEAKER_03]: It reconnected, apparently.

51:26.129 --> 51:28.930
[SPEAKER_03]: Just watch the bandwidth, guys, if you have anything else going on.

51:29.231 --> 51:30.131
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have to get that out there.

51:30.171 --> 51:30.711
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not doing shit.

51:30.731 --> 51:33.193
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, but these things happen, so...

51:34.031 --> 51:35.332
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I agree with GameGuru.

51:35.372 --> 51:37.293
[SPEAKER_10]: VOG is so popular, everyone is crashing it.

51:37.313 --> 51:38.154
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll just go with that.

51:38.574 --> 51:39.615
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are just crashing it.

51:39.635 --> 51:40.835
[SPEAKER_10]: Grocery Lounge Radio.

51:41.075 --> 51:41.736
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anyhow.

51:42.056 --> 51:43.377
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you are the general manager.

51:43.577 --> 51:45.078
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, can we move on with more news?

51:45.758 --> 51:47.339
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how I got on that tangent.

51:47.660 --> 51:49.061
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even know what that had to do with anything.

51:49.121 --> 51:53.003
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, because you were talking about the guy with the pen who would get paid too much to do that.

51:53.063 --> 51:56.505
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, they pay people to do crazy stuff, like the chick who put my stuff on the conveyor belt.

51:58.747 --> 51:59.547
[SPEAKER_03]: Blink, blink.

51:59.927 --> 52:01.088
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Mass Effect.

52:01.328 --> 52:02.069
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a good game.

52:03.711 --> 52:08.158
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to do a trolling dedicated to Dark Tetsuya, if I may.

52:10.462 --> 52:11.404
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen, Ranma.

52:13.453 --> 52:15.075
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not torrent porn.

52:15.375 --> 52:16.176
[SPEAKER_04]: Or torrent anything.

52:16.216 --> 52:18.498
[SPEAKER_04]: Torrenting is so goddamn slow.

52:18.958 --> 52:20.780
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would I torrent anything when there's Usenet?

52:20.800 --> 52:22.061
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna torrent that breadstick.

52:22.221 --> 52:22.982
[SPEAKER_04]: Go right ahead.

52:23.622 --> 52:24.683
[SPEAKER_10]: You're gonna torrent me half of it.

52:25.063 --> 52:27.806
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't torrent hentai or porn.

52:28.126 --> 52:28.987
[SPEAKER_04]: At least not here.

52:29.027 --> 52:29.728
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, shit.

52:29.808 --> 52:31.609
[SPEAKER_04]: This connection's too damn slow for that.

52:32.550 --> 52:35.913
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, so let's talk a little bit about Woodstock.

52:36.554 --> 52:37.434
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm not talking about the...

52:38.735 --> 52:41.957
[SPEAKER_04]: The Gathering of Musicians and Sweaty People.

52:42.357 --> 52:48.441
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about Microsoft's brand new music service for the Xbox 360.

52:49.861 --> 52:50.502
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoopty shit.

52:51.802 --> 52:54.064
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess because Zoom maybe is not taking off too well.

52:55.244 --> 52:57.165
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Loki,

53:19.597 --> 53:22.718
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's going to be similar to Spotify.

53:22.738 --> 53:28.199
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're going to have some sort of Facebook integration as well where you can share your playlists and that kind of stuff.

53:28.640 --> 53:30.100
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can buy bottled water for $7.

53:30.320 --> 53:30.820
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

53:33.121 --> 53:34.181
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a Starbucks?

53:34.541 --> 53:36.502
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a Woodstock 94 joke in there.

53:36.582 --> 53:37.362
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, people.

53:38.943 --> 53:39.403
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Rob.

53:58.337 --> 54:14.655
[SPEAKER_10]: and you know how much all of the people at the original Woodstock got paid like oodles and oodles and oodles to freaking be there and they like underestimated the number of people that would come and there was no toiletries and people died and babies were born but the Woodstock I was thinking of was a cute little yellow bird that hangs out with Snoopy

54:18.277 --> 54:21.179
[SPEAKER_04]: I just... Cool, they're going to have a music service.

54:21.279 --> 54:24.061
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope it's free because otherwise I'm not going to be interested in it.

54:24.241 --> 54:26.142
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about this other half of it then.

54:27.643 --> 54:34.208
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is Microsoft relaunching this again when they've really tried that Zoom thing and it just didn't work?

54:34.388 --> 54:38.091
[SPEAKER_04]: Because now they're trying to be the entertainment hub.

54:38.131 --> 54:43.374
[SPEAKER_04]: They want the Xbox 360 or even whatever the next console is to be this entertainment hub.

54:43.754 --> 54:46.776
[SPEAKER_04]: They're trying to get away from just being a games console.

54:46.797 --> 54:47.177
[SPEAKER_04]: They want...

54:47.697 --> 54:49.538
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a kind of replace like your set-top box.

54:49.578 --> 54:54.579
[SPEAKER_04]: You put it in, you know, your living room with your TV and you're watching movies on there.

54:54.599 --> 54:55.819
[SPEAKER_04]: You're playing games on there.

54:55.859 --> 54:57.720
[SPEAKER_04]: You're having parties in front of it with Kinect.

54:57.780 --> 54:59.940
[SPEAKER_04]: You're, you know, listening to music.

55:00.301 --> 55:03.061
[SPEAKER_04]: They want it to be integrated with your life, basically.

55:03.782 --> 55:05.422
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what they're trying to do with this.

55:05.462 --> 55:06.342
[SPEAKER_04]: They're adding music to it.

55:06.522 --> 55:08.163
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with Infanel in the chat room.

55:08.203 --> 55:09.643
[SPEAKER_03]: Wainstock was much safer.

55:10.243 --> 55:10.623
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

55:10.663 --> 55:13.544
[SPEAKER_03]: If they called this Wainstock, I would... Are you kidding?

55:13.584 --> 55:14.324
[SPEAKER_10]: And give my right arm...

55:16.845 --> 55:17.125
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

55:18.106 --> 55:19.106
[SPEAKER_10]: No, right eye, that was it.

55:20.927 --> 55:21.267
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

55:22.888 --> 55:26.889
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on with some more news, and this one has to do with Skyrim.

55:27.189 --> 55:30.891
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, and it has nothing to do with arrows and body parts, I swear.

55:31.271 --> 55:36.073
[SPEAKER_03]: This has to do with a Skyrim expansion pack, maybe, question mark.

55:36.453 --> 55:41.495
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, in the latest Skyrim patch, there are several references to what's called Snow Elves.

55:41.955 --> 55:45.617
[SPEAKER_03]: including a Snow Elf Prince who has some dialogue.

55:46.237 --> 55:51.459
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also files talking about crossbows, a whole folder called DLC01.

55:51.799 --> 55:53.280
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm, what could that be about?

55:53.700 --> 55:57.422
[SPEAKER_03]: So apparently this is information about the first DLC pack for Skyrim.

55:57.822 --> 56:02.224
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know a whole lot else about it, although there's certainly that part of me that says, I'm gonna buy it.

56:02.604 --> 56:06.306
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that and, gee, this took a little while for this to come out.

56:06.326 --> 56:07.907
[SPEAKER_10]: You too can take an axe to the elbow.

56:08.127 --> 56:10.828
[SPEAKER_04]: Good things come to those who wait, usually.

56:11.949 --> 56:28.606
[SPEAKER_04]: I have more faith in Bethesda and DLC versus any other company on the face of the earth just because it seems like their content is very thoroughly rich and full of actual new things and not stuff that was on the disc.

56:30.322 --> 56:30.662
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

57:00.652 --> 57:27.904
[SPEAKER_10]: how about some Vita crap because it is actually kind of performing like crap in Europe anyway the Vita is being outsold by both the Wii and the PSP in Europe they're basically saying that and this is actually a quote from Iwata of Nintendo saying that based on sales information by market research companies in each European country

57:28.944 --> 57:44.532
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, basically, uh, the, uh, PS3 is the top, with the 3DS and Xbox 360 in second, the Wii in fourth, PSP in fifth, the Vita in sixth, and the DS, um, I guess right after that?

57:45.973 --> 57:52.496
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, um, the Vita's basically selling 25,000 units a week, um, and there's still 70,000 PS3s being sold weekly.

57:54.465 --> 57:56.066
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's some good news for Sony.

57:56.086 --> 57:57.708
[SPEAKER_03]: At least the PS3's on top over there.

57:57.808 --> 57:59.829
[SPEAKER_03]: But, Loki, any idea what this looks like in America?

58:00.010 --> 58:00.650
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this the same?

58:01.111 --> 58:02.692
[SPEAKER_03]: Are Sony having the same issue here?

58:02.892 --> 58:05.634
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm surprised that anyone's still selling a ton of PSPs.

58:05.955 --> 58:12.000
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we don't sell any PSPs, and by we, I mean my customers, because no one's asking for them.

58:12.600 --> 58:14.222
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell, there's nothing coming out for the PSP.

58:14.442 --> 58:17.344
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the last thing was MLB 12, or MLB, yeah, MLB The Show 12.

58:17.384 --> 58:18.425
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, no, MLB 2K12.

58:22.268 --> 58:27.911
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's a few Atlus RPGs, but that's all that really is coming.

58:28.311 --> 58:35.354
[SPEAKER_10]: According to Iwata right now in the US, actually no, this isn't just according to him, but there is a listing on here.

58:35.974 --> 58:44.618
[SPEAKER_10]: At the top of it is Xbox 360, then PS3, then the 3DS, and the Vita right behind the 3DS and 4th, then we have Wii, DS, and PSP.

58:46.280 --> 58:48.162
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is Iwata talking about the Vita?

58:48.222 --> 58:49.683
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I see.

58:49.723 --> 58:52.446
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he's trying to say the 3DS is so much better, blah, blah, blah.

58:52.646 --> 58:55.709
[SPEAKER_10]: He's saying that right now the 3DS is dominating in Japan.

58:55.729 --> 58:57.971
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's been out for a year.

58:58.111 --> 58:58.971
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.

58:59.032 --> 59:00.713
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, why are we even comparing these two systems?

59:00.733 --> 59:04.657
[SPEAKER_04]: You're talking about a system that launched two months ago versus a system that's been out for a year.

59:04.757 --> 59:09.281
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and the Vita is kind of in that point where the 3DS was at this point after its launch.

59:09.321 --> 59:12.323
[SPEAKER_03]: We're like, hooray, we had the launch with all the big launch games.

59:12.424 --> 59:12.944
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're in a low.

59:13.144 --> 59:23.050
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's like, listen Iwata, you better fucking keep that good karma coming because if you start talking, you know, crap about this, you've got a system launching pretty soon and it could tank pretty easy.

59:23.250 --> 59:33.596
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, really he's just been, you know, just speaking, more not, instead of, you know, pooping on everybody else, he's just more been speaking about, oh, the 3DS is doing very well.

59:34.357 --> 59:36.618
[SPEAKER_10]: We're very confident in how the market's going.

59:36.738 --> 59:37.719
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

59:55.891 --> 01:00:18.884
[SPEAKER_03]: and you know the Vita does had a more robust launch lineup but it is still there's nothing to really get I mean Mortal Kombat whether you know it is what it is it's been out already it is a port of a game that's already been out for a year I would think come the holidays E3 this year we're gonna hear more about what the holidays have in store for the Vita and that's some things are really gonna pick up for them again to be fair that's one more Mortal Kombat game than the 3ds has

01:00:21.508 --> 01:00:21.788
[SPEAKER_04]: True.

01:00:22.109 --> 01:00:23.770
[SPEAKER_04]: No one's porting shit to the 3DS.

01:00:23.790 --> 01:00:32.278
[SPEAKER_03]: True, unless you want to say, well, you can play DS games on the 3DS, and I think there was, I think Deadly Alliance or one of them got a port to the DS.

01:00:32.558 --> 01:00:34.160
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably wasn't very good, but it's there.

01:00:34.756 --> 01:00:37.257
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's a Street Fighter 4 game.

01:00:38.838 --> 01:00:39.178
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:00:39.558 --> 01:00:43.419
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, yeah, I don't really think it's fair to compare them yet.

01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:47.261
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still, you know, compare their one-year numbers, okay?

01:00:47.361 --> 01:00:52.623
[SPEAKER_04]: Compare the numbers of the 3DS versus the numbers of the Vita in a year and see where they're at.

01:00:52.663 --> 01:00:54.164
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not surprised that they're behind the 3DS.

01:00:54.184 --> 01:00:57.565
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot more people are picking up 3DSs because I think they're cheaper now.

01:00:57.845 --> 01:01:03.610
[SPEAKER_03]: ShadowNextGen in our chatroom at VOGnetwork.com says, Avita price drop will be announced to E3 if Sony is smart.

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:04.170
[SPEAKER_03]: Agree?

01:01:05.772 --> 01:01:06.312
[SPEAKER_04]: They could.

01:01:06.612 --> 01:01:11.877
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that the 3DS isn't dropping in price anytime soon, so I mean, they could.

01:01:12.057 --> 01:01:15.300
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be smart, but I hope I get some free games with it.

01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:41.288
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think a price drop will come but I think they'll sweeten the pot of the existing pack what I mean by that is larger memory card and probably more like throw-ins like comes with an eight gig memory card that already has little big planet vita oh what oops that's another big game that's coming out at some point right now that got pushed back right it's not coming out they haven't announced today all right then fucking mod nation racers vita I don't just

01:01:41.388 --> 01:01:44.070
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want the Vita to fail, but I feel like it's going to happen.

01:02:05.276 --> 01:02:06.057
[SPEAKER_03]: It's too early.

01:02:06.157 --> 01:02:10.280
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's too... Again, you gotta go back to where the 3DS was at this point.

01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:19.287
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody said, 3DS gonna fail, 3DS gonna fail, and then bam, price drop, bam, Mario, bam, you know, it's just, everything just hit it once, and the system really recovered.

01:02:20.468 --> 01:02:25.652
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and the PlayStation 3 early on was hideous.

01:02:26.693 --> 01:02:28.935
[SPEAKER_03]: Too damn expensive and nothing on it.

01:02:29.335 --> 01:02:31.417
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, but PlayStation's really come around.

01:02:31.477 --> 01:02:34.460
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I think it's too early to bury the Vita

01:02:35.757 --> 01:02:39.981
[SPEAKER_03]: is the Vita flying off shells in the must-have technology that Sony wanted it to be?

01:02:40.401 --> 01:02:44.464
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, maybe not, but that doesn't mean it's a dead and dying system.

01:02:44.665 --> 01:02:45.866
[SPEAKER_04]: They tried, I think.

01:02:45.926 --> 01:02:50.390
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they had a better launch than the 3DS had, that's for sure.

01:02:51.110 --> 01:02:52.832
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have a lot more games coming out.

01:02:52.992 --> 01:02:55.454
[SPEAKER_04]: And even the 3DS, I mean, there's games coming out, but...

01:02:56.954 --> 01:03:06.299
[SPEAKER_04]: I would think that the hardcore gamer using the 3DS, I think there's only a handful of games really coming out before the end of this year that they might be interested in.

01:03:06.819 --> 01:03:13.222
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas I think there's going to be a lot more of that for the... I'm sorry, the 3DS has a handful of games.

01:03:13.522 --> 01:03:17.004
[SPEAKER_04]: The Vita, I think they've got quite a bit of potential games coming out for it.

01:03:17.044 --> 01:03:25.307
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, hell, there's some big first-party games still on their way in the next couple months, and Call of Duty's going to help.

01:03:25.768 --> 01:03:28.029
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, fuck, a portable Call of Duty game?

01:03:29.269 --> 01:03:38.994
[SPEAKER_04]: Not necessarily the PSP ones, because they're kind of... But one on the Vita that's... If you've got Black Ops 2 or whatever they're going to call it on the Vita, that could be pretty big.

01:03:39.014 --> 01:03:39.894
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:03:40.194 --> 01:03:43.898
[SPEAKER_03]: Slidekick in our chatroom says, Girl, PS3 is still hideous, Rob.

01:03:44.078 --> 01:03:44.619
[SPEAKER_03]: I disagree.

01:03:44.839 --> 01:03:45.920
[SPEAKER_03]: I really disagree.

01:03:46.982 --> 01:03:55.210
[SPEAKER_03]: LittleBigPlanet, there is nothing like it on Nintendo, there's nothing like it on Microsoft, and it is an incredible video game.

01:03:55.551 --> 01:03:57.593
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's Sony's franchise.

01:03:57.633 --> 01:04:01.077
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just the one that comes up to the mind as most important for me.

01:04:01.938 --> 01:04:24.817
[SPEAKER_03]: I still say Sony despite all our jokes earlier about 6-axis I think now Sony has the better controller I prefer to play games with the Sony controller than I do the 360 Sony does have the free online for whatever it's worth you know I don't mean to sound like a fanboy there's reasons why I like 360 as well but you know I don't think it's all doom and gloom with the PlayStation 3 I think I think consumers have a real choice to make

01:04:25.578 --> 01:04:27.840
[SPEAKER_03]: and when somebody asks me, Rob, what should I get?

01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:30.581
[SPEAKER_03]: A PlayStation 3 or a Xbox 360?

01:04:31.522 --> 01:04:33.283
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to go back to the golden rule of gaming.

01:04:33.383 --> 01:04:35.404
[SPEAKER_03]: A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

01:04:35.424 --> 01:04:35.925
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you want to play?

01:04:35.945 --> 01:04:38.066
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to play Halo or do you want to play LittleBigPlanet?

01:04:38.426 --> 01:04:41.888
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to play Fable or do you want to play God of War?

01:04:42.889 --> 01:04:44.610
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really about those issues.

01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:49.823
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, anyhow, let's move on with some release dates.

01:04:49.843 --> 01:04:54.026
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to travel around the world and check out what's coming out soon in a store near you.

01:04:54.427 --> 01:04:55.427
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not a lot this week.

01:04:55.527 --> 01:04:56.128
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty dead.

01:04:57.189 --> 01:05:04.054
[SPEAKER_04]: So, starting things off, we've got Sniper Elite V2 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.

01:05:04.675 --> 01:05:07.617
[SPEAKER_04]: Terra Online and the Collector's Edition as well.

01:05:07.917 --> 01:05:11.020
[SPEAKER_04]: That's coming out on PC, which will be pretty awesome.

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:14.182
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of Mortal Kombat for the Vita, that is coming out this week.

01:05:14.863 --> 01:05:14.943
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

01:05:17.706 --> 01:05:23.591
[SPEAKER_04]: and... and I honestly think that's probably it because it's pretty dead.

01:05:23.611 --> 01:05:26.995
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to make sure I didn't miss anything.

01:05:28.036 --> 01:05:28.516
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, that's it.

01:05:29.297 --> 01:05:32.340
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, traveling to Japan and looking at the releases over there in Japan.

01:05:32.420 --> 01:05:35.823
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing on the 3DS this week which strikes me as kind of odd but yeah, no, nothing.

01:05:36.144 --> 01:05:37.585
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, the system's dying!

01:05:40.734 --> 01:05:41.654
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, how about the Vita?

01:05:41.674 --> 01:05:42.635
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the Vita got this week?

01:05:42.755 --> 01:05:43.475
[SPEAKER_03]: Also nothing.

01:05:44.635 --> 01:05:45.556
[SPEAKER_03]: That is also dying.

01:05:45.996 --> 01:05:46.796
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all dying.

01:05:47.196 --> 01:05:52.318
[SPEAKER_03]: On the PlayStation 3 this week, Starhawk on May 10th, although I think that's really next week, actually.

01:05:52.338 --> 01:05:54.399
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the week after, yeah.

01:05:54.439 --> 01:05:55.999
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a holiday in Japan this week or something?

01:05:56.019 --> 01:05:57.080
[SPEAKER_03]: Because nothing on the PlayStation 3?

01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:59.100
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the Xbox 360?

01:05:59.721 --> 01:06:00.021
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.

01:06:00.781 --> 01:06:01.401
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.

01:06:02.121 --> 01:06:04.422
[SPEAKER_04]: All game systems are gonna die.

01:06:04.922 --> 01:06:05.883
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all dying.

01:06:06.243 --> 01:06:06.643
[SPEAKER_04]: All of them.

01:06:08.678 --> 01:06:10.759
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what's going on.

01:06:10.799 --> 01:06:11.460
[SPEAKER_03]: There must be something.

01:06:12.821 --> 01:06:14.542
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a lot of releases until May 17th.

01:06:14.943 --> 01:06:16.103
[SPEAKER_03]: Things are kind of slowing down over there.

01:06:16.924 --> 01:06:19.286
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have nothing to report for Japanese releases.

01:06:19.946 --> 01:06:24.570
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, the good news is, for those of you who like to import games, your wallet is spared this month.

01:06:25.586 --> 01:06:27.048
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a few in Europe.

01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:29.030
[SPEAKER_03]: We have... Thank you.

01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:30.331
[SPEAKER_03]: Golden Week is this week.

01:06:30.511 --> 01:06:30.952
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

01:06:30.992 --> 01:06:32.173
[SPEAKER_03]: The chatter's all just chimed in.

01:06:32.213 --> 01:06:32.913
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Golden Week.

01:06:32.934 --> 01:06:34.795
[SPEAKER_10]: That's when everyone goes back to their hometown.

01:06:35.076 --> 01:06:35.276
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

01:06:35.836 --> 01:06:35.997
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

01:06:37.058 --> 01:06:39.180
[SPEAKER_03]: What, no handheld games for the train ride there?

01:06:40.552 --> 01:07:06.103
[SPEAKER_10]: No Animal Crossing Places are closed all week See, I knew the chatters would know something cultural that I was missing So yeah, Golden Week is the reason Us ignit gamers I know, stupid Americans, sorry In Europe, on May 2nd we have Velocity for the PSP On May 3rd we have Terra for PC And on the 4th we have MUDFIM, Motocross World Championship And that is it

01:07:08.439 --> 01:07:08.799
[SPEAKER_03]: Next!

01:07:08.959 --> 01:07:11.060
[SPEAKER_03]: It must be Golden Week in the UK as well, huh?

01:07:11.961 --> 01:07:13.441
[SPEAKER_03]: I want a Golden Week.

01:07:13.461 --> 01:07:14.962
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't we have a Golden Week in the US?

01:07:15.242 --> 01:07:16.163
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we have Spring Break.

01:07:18.184 --> 01:07:19.504
[SPEAKER_10]: I wish we had Golden Week too.

01:07:19.524 --> 01:07:21.605
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit doesn't close on Spring Break.

01:07:23.326 --> 01:07:26.088
[SPEAKER_10]: People here have no respect for their hometown.

01:07:26.148 --> 01:07:26.648
[SPEAKER_10]: End of story.

01:07:26.928 --> 01:07:30.850
[SPEAKER_03]: You're comparing Golden Week to Spring Break.

01:07:30.930 --> 01:07:32.191
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's examine the two.

01:07:32.651 --> 01:07:33.371
[SPEAKER_03]: Golden Week.

01:07:33.811 --> 01:07:36.833
[SPEAKER_03]: A great chance for me to go visit my family and really...

01:07:37.453 --> 01:07:40.235
[SPEAKER_03]: Spring Break Bitches be getting drunk and topless and horny

01:07:52.620 --> 01:07:54.822
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna get laid on spring break.

01:07:54.882 --> 01:07:57.404
[SPEAKER_04]: It's golden week in Mexico.

01:08:00.066 --> 01:08:01.728
[SPEAKER_03]: It's golden week in Cancun.

01:08:01.748 --> 01:08:03.729
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, because they're like cha-ching.

01:08:04.730 --> 01:08:07.172
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's our yearly revenue in one week.

01:08:08.413 --> 01:08:11.756
[SPEAKER_04]: It's golden peso week.

01:08:11.836 --> 01:08:12.216
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:08:13.177 --> 01:08:13.777
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

01:08:14.638 --> 01:08:18.862
[SPEAKER_03]: Slidekick in our chatroom says spring break is better because it has wet t-shirt contests.

01:08:18.902 --> 01:08:20.203
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't see that in golden week.

01:08:22.028 --> 01:08:22.869
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we move on, please?

01:08:23.810 --> 01:08:25.231
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we can move on.

01:08:27.112 --> 01:08:27.553
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

01:08:28.514 --> 01:08:33.017
[SPEAKER_04]: Golden week all throughout the year if there's wet t-shirt contests involved.

01:08:33.978 --> 01:08:35.159
[SPEAKER_04]: And drunk sluts.

01:08:36.921 --> 01:08:38.942
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, for some people, that may be their hometown.

01:08:38.962 --> 01:08:40.183
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just Friday.

01:08:40.704 --> 01:08:41.785
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just Friday.

01:08:43.466 --> 01:08:44.907
[SPEAKER_04]: In here, it's always Friday.

01:08:47.693 --> 01:08:51.877
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, Nintendo has some losses to report.

01:08:53.358 --> 01:08:58.643
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they may have lost a little bit of money with 3DS.

01:08:58.983 --> 01:09:00.985
[SPEAKER_04]: $461.2 million in losses to be exact.

01:09:01.765 --> 01:09:06.890
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, they've kind of rebounded a little bit, but the initial hit from the new...

01:09:08.350 --> 01:09:18.554
[SPEAKER_04]: 3DS launch and the Redux selling also dropping the price of the Wii and they're saying the Strong N and other things factored into it.

01:09:18.994 --> 01:09:19.874
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a big surprise.

01:09:20.074 --> 01:09:34.499
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, their brand new fiscal year started April 1st and they're aiming to not sell the 3DS under cost because right now they're actually losing money on each system that's being put out and

01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:37.101
[SPEAKER_04]: But not much.

01:09:37.341 --> 01:09:43.326
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they're... I believe it's... Actually, no, it doesn't say how much they're losing there.

01:09:43.346 --> 01:09:44.507
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was only like a few bucks.

01:09:45.067 --> 01:09:47.329
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, they're taking losses on each system.

01:09:47.429 --> 01:09:55.836
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, Nintendo, unlike the other companies out there, actually like making profits on each piece of hardware that goes out, which they were doing, obviously, when it was $250, but not necessarily now.

01:09:59.198 --> 01:10:19.434
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and then of course, uh, they're saying that with the Wii U launch and the Wii console, um, by the end of next fiscal year, uh, which would be March 31st, 2013, they're gonna have, uh, combined sales of 10.5 million units, um, during that whole year.

01:10:19.894 --> 01:10:21.896
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, mm.

01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:23.320
[SPEAKER_04]: Eh, maybe.

01:10:23.940 --> 01:10:32.982
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess, well, fiscal 2012, they sold 9.84 million Wii units, so they're planning on growing that a bit more.

01:10:33.182 --> 01:10:38.923
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, I don't see the Wii selling as fast as, you know, it was before.

01:10:39.363 --> 01:10:42.524
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, if they announce another price drop, because there's a new console coming out.

01:10:42.544 --> 01:10:45.865
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say, a price drop, that has to factor into this somehow.

01:10:45.885 --> 01:10:48.105
[SPEAKER_04]: If they drop the price again, that could be interesting.

01:10:49.878 --> 01:10:50.438
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that Wii?

01:10:50.699 --> 01:10:52.540
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't the Wii already like 99 bucks?

01:10:53.081 --> 01:10:53.901
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's still like 149.

01:10:54.182 --> 01:10:57.824
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so let's say they're going to come out and the Wii is 99 bucks.

01:10:57.945 --> 01:11:03.429
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be hard to ignore, especially for the... You know what the big audience is for that?

01:11:03.469 --> 01:11:07.612
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nobody that listens to this show unless you have a 5 to 12-year-old.

01:11:07.773 --> 01:11:08.393
[SPEAKER_03]: But here's my problem.

01:11:08.413 --> 01:11:10.315
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a huge sweet spot for the Wii.

01:11:10.615 --> 01:11:14.798
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a huge sweet spot for the Wii, and it will cannibalize the Wii U sales.

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:30.418
[SPEAKER_04]: I can buy this brand new console, it's basically a Wii but it has better graphics for $2.99 or I can pay $99 and get a Wii and play all these Mario games that I really want to play and that's it.

01:11:30.785 --> 01:11:33.407
[SPEAKER_04]: and later on I'll upgrade to the new Wii.

01:11:33.687 --> 01:11:46.938
[SPEAKER_03]: If there was a new Xbox or Playstation this year I might agree with you but I actually think core gamer interest may be a little higher especially if Nintendo does it right and throws out a new Zelda game with this although I'm not expecting it.

01:11:47.158 --> 01:11:52.623
[SPEAKER_03]: Or a Metroid or something you know that the core gamers are going to jizz over.

01:11:53.003 --> 01:11:58.707
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like seeing the lineup just like kind of the whispers and stuff of their lineup a lot of it is like

01:11:59.748 --> 01:12:26.566
[SPEAKER_04]: Batman Arkham City great I get to play that on the Wii U but it's been out for a fucking year Darksiders 2 okay well that might be delayed by the time we get there to the launch of the Wii but it'll be out Ninja Gaiden 3 a game that sucked on the Xbox 360 and PS3 I think we really don't know though because what Nintendo was trying to do with that was say hey we can compete with everybody else now we're gonna have all the games that the other systems have so leave us alone

01:12:26.986 --> 01:12:29.627
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't really know what's coming until this evening.

01:12:29.647 --> 01:12:31.068
[SPEAKER_04]: I really do know what's coming.

01:12:31.248 --> 01:12:38.012
[SPEAKER_03]: Batman Arkham City is coming for the Wii U. I mean... What if, heaven forbid, Loki, what if they're actually keeping some secrets?

01:12:39.272 --> 01:12:40.273
[SPEAKER_04]: They may have some first party stuff.

01:12:40.293 --> 01:12:42.314
[SPEAKER_03]: Animal Crossing Wii U. Oh, God.

01:12:43.194 --> 01:12:44.955
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not buying it for... I'm sorry.

01:12:45.095 --> 01:12:46.956
[SPEAKER_04]: I will not buy a system for Animal Crossing.

01:12:47.036 --> 01:12:48.677
[SPEAKER_03]: Now your little Wii pad is a strip mall.

01:12:48.797 --> 01:12:50.518
[SPEAKER_04]: I did that for GameCube, okay?

01:12:50.818 --> 01:12:53.980
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will not do that for... No.

01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:55.340
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.

01:12:55.460 --> 01:12:55.881
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just...

01:12:57.607 --> 01:13:00.410
[SPEAKER_04]: They will probably have a Zelda game or something like that.

01:13:00.450 --> 01:13:01.571
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be pretty smart.

01:13:02.151 --> 01:13:04.613
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think a Pikmin game is going to launch that goddamn system.

01:13:04.953 --> 01:13:12.179
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope I'm not stepping on a story coming up later because I remember reading this earlier, but Nintendo has been talking about a new franchise.

01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:14.682
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's time for a new character.

01:13:14.722 --> 01:13:15.943
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

01:13:16.103 --> 01:13:16.963
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm down with that.

01:13:17.084 --> 01:13:17.664
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

01:13:18.144 --> 01:13:19.425
[SPEAKER_03]: They need some new franchises.

01:13:19.446 --> 01:13:19.826
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

01:13:21.223 --> 01:13:21.703
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:13:44.468 --> 01:13:48.813
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I do not disagree, what about something that doesn't exist yet?

01:13:48.933 --> 01:13:53.237
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Animal Crossing didn't exist until, well, here in America, the GameCube, but the 64.

01:13:53.317 --> 01:13:54.398
[SPEAKER_04]: I completely agree with you.

01:13:54.418 --> 01:13:55.639
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what hasn't existed yet?

01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:59.343
[SPEAKER_04]: A fucking sequel to Excite Truck is what we need.

01:13:59.363 --> 01:14:00.544
[SPEAKER_03]: We need Excite Truck 2.

01:14:00.624 --> 01:14:01.445
[SPEAKER_04]: No, seriously.

01:14:01.645 --> 01:14:02.986
[SPEAKER_04]: The best racing game of the week.

01:14:03.387 --> 01:14:04.468
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just piss it away.

01:14:04.548 --> 01:14:08.131
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to make a game with fucking mini games in the middle of a race.

01:14:08.171 --> 01:14:08.712
[SPEAKER_04]: That was genius.

01:14:08.932 --> 01:14:09.833
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:14:09.893 --> 01:14:11.996
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, I have more Wii stuff I got to get out of here.

01:14:12.136 --> 01:14:23.029
[SPEAKER_03]: This is important because when the Wii U launches, one thing Nintendo is committed to, I should say, sorry, excuse me, misspoke, exploring, but when I read something like this, I go, they're going to do it.

01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:26.574
[SPEAKER_03]: Digital distribution of full retail games.

01:14:26.974 --> 01:14:31.957
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting on the 3DS, not even just the Wii U, but starting on the 3DS with New Super Mario Bros.

01:14:32.338 --> 01:14:37.241
[SPEAKER_03]: 2 will be available digital download as well as full retail release.

01:14:37.341 --> 01:14:39.222
[SPEAKER_03]: But they made it very clear, choice.

01:14:39.402 --> 01:14:40.043
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a choice.

01:14:41.464 --> 01:14:43.025
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently... And no price break.

01:14:43.145 --> 01:14:51.550
[SPEAKER_03]: They are being aggressive about the Wii U. Iwata did announce Wii U games will be both in stores and digital distribution at launch.

01:14:51.570 --> 01:14:53.092
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I thought I had heard it confirmed in there.

01:14:53.112 --> 01:14:55.033
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess the 3DS is the one that's being explored.

01:14:56.874 --> 01:14:57.495
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

01:15:12.598 --> 01:15:13.779
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you do that?

01:15:14.019 --> 01:15:17.081
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I understand why you would do that, so you can take your games with you.

01:15:17.741 --> 01:15:22.024
[SPEAKER_03]: But remember, they tie to the system, not the account, which is very important.

01:15:22.584 --> 01:15:31.390
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming if you ever upgrade your system, there's a way to transfer the licenses, because I think there is with the Ambassador program on the DS, but, you know, just kind of keep...

01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:33.971
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyhow, oh, yeah, they do.

01:15:34.031 --> 01:15:36.633
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess they came out later and said, yes, we are doing it.

01:15:37.393 --> 01:15:39.755
[SPEAKER_03]: August 2012 is when New Super Mario Bros.

01:15:39.775 --> 01:15:41.656
[SPEAKER_03]: 2 is going to be the first game that's out.

01:15:42.396 --> 01:15:45.999
[SPEAKER_03]: Packaged and digital formats, consumers can make the choice.

01:15:46.279 --> 01:15:51.382
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, a game called Onitore, which is a temp name, is also supposed to be sold like this.

01:15:51.402 --> 01:15:52.323
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a brain age game.

01:15:52.683 --> 01:15:52.843
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:15:54.104 --> 01:15:54.564
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

01:15:56.552 --> 01:16:06.434
[SPEAKER_03]: One other thing about the 3DS, it's all going to be connected, excuse me, the Wii U and the 3DS are all connected through Nintendo eShop.

01:16:06.514 --> 01:16:14.095
[SPEAKER_03]: And they say, quote, the majority, key word, of first party 3DS and Wii U games will be sold this way.

01:16:14.195 --> 01:16:23.557
[SPEAKER_03]: The dual distribution strategy, digital downloads on launch day, you'll be able to get 16 digit codes through the Nintendo eShop if you want to go buy it in a store or whatever.

01:16:23.997 --> 01:16:27.238
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't mean that I'm going to open up a box and then it's going to be a card, does it?

01:16:27.258 --> 01:16:28.178
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's kind of shitty.

01:16:29.458 --> 01:16:31.739
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but Sony has tried that before.

01:16:31.759 --> 01:16:32.919
[SPEAKER_04]: They had Patapon 2.

01:16:32.999 --> 01:16:33.799
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like that.

01:16:34.219 --> 01:16:35.940
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, here's a case.

01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:37.700
[SPEAKER_03]: Those Vita games aren't far from it.

01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:41.961
[SPEAKER_03]: There is nothing in that Vita case but a little plastic slot to put in that cartridge.

01:16:41.981 --> 01:16:42.501
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what?

01:16:42.541 --> 01:16:46.842
[SPEAKER_04]: At least that's something that I can sell back at some point if I feel like it or sell it used.

01:16:47.002 --> 01:16:47.442
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

01:16:48.183 --> 01:16:48.363
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

01:16:50.143 --> 01:17:10.701
[SPEAKER_04]: Once again, though, I mean, this sounds like a great idea, but then we have to realize, you know, it works for the Vita, I think it could work for the 3DS, but when we're talking games that are gonna be significantly larger in size, and I'm talking about, like, actual storage space on, like, a Blu-ray disc, it's gonna get fucking annoying.

01:17:11.321 --> 01:17:15.625
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can download a title, you know, on my Wii U, but...

01:17:17.202 --> 01:17:18.103
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, why would you?

01:17:18.243 --> 01:17:23.108
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, the 3DS, it makes sense because people want to take their games with them.

01:17:23.148 --> 01:17:25.250
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't want to have to carry a bunch of cartridges.

01:17:25.290 --> 01:17:29.253
[SPEAKER_04]: They can, you know, store a bunch of games on there and be done with it.

01:17:29.574 --> 01:17:31.195
[SPEAKER_04]: But for the Wii U, it doesn't make any sense.

01:17:31.476 --> 01:17:38.062
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I understand some people download full digital games on the PS3 and stuff, but you can upgrade the hard drive and that thing.

01:17:38.082 --> 01:17:40.824
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a 500GB hard drive, so that doesn't really bother me too much, but...

01:17:42.005 --> 01:17:48.108
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they better have adequate storage, and it also takes a really long time.

01:17:48.168 --> 01:17:51.929
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I downloaded Infamous 1, which is a good 8-gig game.

01:17:51.969 --> 01:17:53.150
[SPEAKER_04]: That took a couple hours.

01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:58.312
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm not going to want to do that for a game that's larger than a DVD-R.

01:17:59.413 --> 01:18:03.714
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we're talking like double that size, maybe even triple that size.

01:18:04.575 --> 01:18:06.195
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you do that and kill your bandwidth?

01:18:06.215 --> 01:18:09.917
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let me give one other quote here about the license rights so we can talk about that real quick.

01:18:10.457 --> 01:18:27.825
[SPEAKER_03]: Iwata did state that the 3DS retail games will be stored in the SD memory card and be playable only with the hardware to which it was downloaded so that unlike how you get to share a package software, the consumer cannot share the software with other 3DS systems owned by other members of the family or friends.

01:18:29.125 --> 01:18:34.687
[SPEAKER_03]: but that's not any different than the eShop games that are there now like say VVVVV or whatever is the same way.

01:18:34.887 --> 01:18:57.557
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too bad they couldn't have just added a feature to the cards where you can download it to a certain system and once it's downloaded to that system it marks something in the card that shows that it's been downloaded to a system and you can't download it again but you can still play the card or you can revoke your privileges and then it clears out whatever that is and granted I'm sure someone could possibly hack it but

01:18:57.837 --> 01:19:00.559
[SPEAKER_10]: It's sort of like how iTunes has authorizing computers.

01:19:01.119 --> 01:19:01.800
[SPEAKER_10]: Something like that, yeah.

01:19:01.860 --> 01:19:03.361
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a good way to think about it.

01:19:03.381 --> 01:19:08.043
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, but that would have required them to have forethought for this stuff.

01:19:08.083 --> 01:19:12.586
[SPEAKER_04]: And since they didn't do that at launch and it's been out for a year now, it's probably not going to happen.

01:19:12.846 --> 01:19:17.489
[SPEAKER_03]: Porkchop in our chatroom says, If the market goes entirely digital, it's a massive middle finger to the gamer.

01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:20.571
[SPEAKER_03]: And ShadowNextGen says, That'll eventually happen, Porkchop.

01:19:20.731 --> 01:19:21.372
[SPEAKER_03]: It's inevitable.

01:19:21.632 --> 01:19:22.933
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to happen.

01:19:23.193 --> 01:19:24.974
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to happen anytime soon.

01:19:25.396 --> 01:19:28.600
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it'll happen soon, but... It's not.

01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:32.204
[SPEAKER_03]: The consumer can ultimately reject it.

01:19:32.584 --> 01:19:34.606
[SPEAKER_10]: I want a return of Neo Geo-sized cartridges.

01:19:34.807 --> 01:19:37.249
[SPEAKER_03]: The PSP Go was rejected by the consumer.

01:19:37.289 --> 01:19:41.894
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to happen because, first off, the consumer likes having physical product.

01:19:42.495 --> 01:19:43.216
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

01:19:56.707 --> 01:20:00.071
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to be fair, ShadowNextGen in the chat says, I didn't say it would happen soon.

01:20:01.293 --> 01:20:03.175
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's going to happen any time in the near future.

01:20:04.256 --> 01:20:05.538
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too convenient.

01:20:05.558 --> 01:20:07.621
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more convenient to go to a store.

01:20:08.261 --> 01:20:14.990
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously, am I going to spend 10 minutes driving to a local store and picking up a copy of a game?

01:20:15.470 --> 01:20:16.551
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's such an inconvenience.

01:20:16.752 --> 01:20:19.375
[SPEAKER_04]: Or wait six hours for the same game to fucking download.

01:20:19.415 --> 01:20:26.943
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you what's fucking convenient and not to sound like a commercial, but Amazon will have that fucker on my doorstep when I get home from work.

01:20:27.564 --> 01:20:29.026
[SPEAKER_03]: That's convenient to me.

01:20:29.326 --> 01:20:29.426
[SPEAKER_03]: It's...

01:20:30.587 --> 01:20:32.209
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to take a step back, you guys.

01:20:32.309 --> 01:20:33.510
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to take a step back to simpler times.

01:20:51.647 --> 01:21:03.350
[SPEAKER_03]: we need to go back to when digital distribution wasn't even a thang it was nothing you know how you digitally distributed something you got it on the back of a truck to your nearby Chuck E. Cheese that was distribution

01:21:04.537 --> 01:21:06.017
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

01:21:06.037 --> 01:21:07.978
[SPEAKER_03]: The first classic game of the week at VOG.

01:21:25.623 --> 01:21:26.184
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan

01:21:51.484 --> 01:21:59.591
[SPEAKER_10]: Defender came out for the arcade done by Williams in 1980, which is a shooting game all 2D back in the day.

01:22:01.392 --> 01:22:06.337
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to basically defeat all these different invading aliens while protecting your astronauts.

01:22:07.397 --> 01:22:17.987
[SPEAKER_10]: It was developed by Eugene Jarvis, who I've actually, at Classic Gaming Expo a few years back, I got to sit in on a panel with him, and it was just awesome listening to this guy talk about it.

01:22:18.067 --> 01:22:23.512
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, this video that we're playing the audio from is already quiet, and this game didn't really have a lot of noise.

01:22:23.572 --> 01:22:25.333
[SPEAKER_03]: It was pew-pew.

01:22:26.154 --> 01:22:28.376
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a lot to hear, but there are some laser noises for you.

01:22:28.396 --> 01:22:29.257
[SPEAKER_10]: Pew-pew, pew-pew.

01:22:30.412 --> 01:22:33.813
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, this was the first game that Eugene Jarvis programmed.

01:22:33.853 --> 01:22:35.353
[SPEAKER_10]: He was a pinball programmer before that.

01:22:36.554 --> 01:22:39.134
[SPEAKER_10]: And he was inspired by Space Invaders and Asteroids.

01:22:41.255 --> 01:22:48.216
[SPEAKER_10]: The plan was to display the game at the Amusement and Music Operators Association, but it was delayed.

01:22:49.216 --> 01:22:55.158
[SPEAKER_10]: The game itself, though, was highly successful, sold 55,000 units, and it was their best-selling arcade game.

01:22:56.579 --> 01:23:10.855
[SPEAKER_10]: and basically it's the game pretty much that put Eugene Jarvis' name amongst the top contributors to the video game industry there is.

01:23:10.956 --> 01:23:11.757
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's pretty cool.

01:23:13.478 --> 01:23:21.100
[SPEAKER_10]: At any rate, when it was developed, it was Williams' first attempt at a new video game.

01:23:21.921 --> 01:23:24.902
[SPEAKER_10]: The earlier one that they had was basically a version of Pong.

01:23:26.122 --> 01:23:32.104
[SPEAKER_10]: And they were really, really trying to cash in on how popular video games were getting in 1979.

01:23:33.864 --> 01:23:40.626
[SPEAKER_10]: So, they had basically one of their best pinball programmers get right to it.

01:23:41.326 --> 01:23:45.847
[SPEAKER_10]: He also, he headed the department, and there's other big names that were involved with that.

01:23:46.107 --> 01:23:51.509
[SPEAKER_10]: Larry DeMar, Sam Dicker, Paul DeSalt, they were all involved in this.

01:23:51.809 --> 01:23:54.050
[SPEAKER_10]: They worked under him as the head.

01:23:55.770 --> 01:24:11.042
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically, Jarvis, just going into the development history, spent three to four months working on different versions of Taito Space Invaders and Atari's Asteroids, and tried to work games that had similar mechanics.

01:24:11.142 --> 01:24:18.167
[SPEAKER_10]: Asteroids, of course, was Vector, had a special monitor, but this one he wanted to really work on a conventional monitor.

01:24:18.967 --> 01:24:28.812
[SPEAKER_10]: So, basically, they just took what they liked from Asteroids, being the warping effect they really liked, and then wanted a player to be able to fly back and forth across the screen.

01:24:30.872 --> 01:24:39.996
[SPEAKER_10]: He only wanted it to go from left to right, but a person who I have met convinced him to make it scroll around.

01:24:40.016 --> 01:24:41.077
[SPEAKER_10]: You know who that is?

01:24:43.038 --> 01:24:43.398
[SPEAKER_02]: Who?

01:24:43.458 --> 01:24:44.039
[SPEAKER_10]: Steve Ritchie.

01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:44.620
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:52.087
[SPEAKER_10]: Who was the man that designed, he actually was the voice of the Black Knight and the voice of the Skull in No Fear.

01:24:52.187 --> 01:24:53.269
[SPEAKER_03]: Was he the voice of Sinstar?

01:24:54.189 --> 01:24:54.670
[SPEAKER_03]: Beware.

01:24:54.710 --> 01:24:54.910
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

01:24:55.271 --> 01:24:56.412
[SPEAKER_03]: That guy's awesome.

01:24:56.472 --> 01:24:57.092
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was him.

01:24:57.393 --> 01:24:58.774
[SPEAKER_03]: I want him to do bumpers for VOG.

01:24:59.014 --> 01:25:00.176
[SPEAKER_10]: But I could talk to him.

01:25:00.816 --> 01:25:01.177
[SPEAKER_10]: Sweet.

01:25:01.837 --> 01:25:06.322
[SPEAKER_10]: But he's also the guy that designed Twilight Zone.

01:25:07.842 --> 01:25:10.224
[SPEAKER_10]: and Black Knight, Steve Ritchie.

01:25:10.344 --> 01:25:12.546
[SPEAKER_10]: And he is the sweetest, sweetest guy.

01:25:13.006 --> 01:25:14.427
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, moving forward.

01:25:15.428 --> 01:25:18.190
[SPEAKER_10]: He basically was the guy that suggested that it should scroll in either direction.

01:25:18.330 --> 01:25:24.635
[SPEAKER_10]: So it took six months to develop it and they really pushed it through and...

01:25:25.696 --> 01:25:33.519
[SPEAKER_10]: So now they have, basically they added in the Planetscape background as sort of an afterthought.

01:25:33.639 --> 01:25:40.642
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you'll notice, it's only a pixel wide, those lines, because this hardware wasn't powerful enough to do anything better.

01:25:42.575 --> 01:25:47.661
[SPEAKER_10]: So basically after that six months, they really pushed it forward to try to get it done by AMOA.

01:25:48.561 --> 01:25:53.126
[SPEAKER_10]: But it took a lot later to do, and they incorporated more things.

01:25:53.146 --> 01:25:55.589
[SPEAKER_10]: They had the swarmers, the pods, all the different gameplay.

01:25:56.169 --> 01:25:57.331
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they had...

01:25:58.872 --> 01:26:04.898
[SPEAKER_10]: They created erasable programmable read-only memory chips for the game to install the cabinets, but they didn't work.

01:26:05.339 --> 01:26:08.242
[SPEAKER_10]: So they actually had to do more to get it to work.

01:26:08.662 --> 01:26:13.967
[SPEAKER_10]: They got the Attract Mode operational, they got all of the stuff done, and finally had it playable.

01:26:14.768 --> 01:26:29.795
[SPEAKER_10]: So the game itself is basically, it's Monaro Sound, it's Pixel on CRT, and it's being run by Motorola again, 6809 central processing chip, which is big stuff in 1980.

01:26:31.289 --> 01:26:48.799
[SPEAKER_10]: So the game actually, it didn't really attract a lot of attention in 1980 when it came out, but it ended up being well received in the arcades, and there were tons of crowds during the playtesting, so they actually did a cocktail version of this as well.

01:26:49.379 --> 01:26:51.220
[SPEAKER_10]: So like I said, they sold over 55,000 units worldwide.

01:26:54.587 --> 01:27:16.365
[SPEAKER_10]: by 2004 the game was a collector's item the upright cabinets you could still find but the cocktail tables of course you know how that went you could hardly find them at all and it was actually considered one of the most successful games in 1981 it outperformed Pac-Man just saying

01:27:18.547 --> 01:27:21.891
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, the graphics at its time were completely revolutionary.

01:27:22.853 --> 01:27:24.935
[SPEAKER_10]: It did things that you hadn't seen in the game before.

01:27:25.796 --> 01:27:30.983
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, all this by a guy who had not ever done a video game before.

01:27:31.283 --> 01:27:34.968
[SPEAKER_03]: He did pinball, but... Sometimes it just takes a different perspective, you know?

01:27:35.512 --> 01:27:44.898
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but I mean, since then we've had so many different games reference it, so many different games actually work off of things of it.

01:27:45.299 --> 01:27:54.885
[SPEAKER_10]: There were software bugs in the game that allowed people to extend their length of time, and there was another one that kept track on how it scores, so basically people could keep earning extra lives and stuff.

01:27:55.285 --> 01:27:57.747
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we're talking early game hacking, you know.

01:27:58.627 --> 01:28:03.451
[SPEAKER_10]: This, you know, hacking, you know, Street Fighter X Tekken is nothing new.

01:28:03.511 --> 01:28:04.712
[SPEAKER_10]: People were doing it in the 80s.

01:28:07.154 --> 01:28:09.156
[SPEAKER_10]: You remember the dude that did Pac-Man Fever?

01:28:10.097 --> 01:28:11.058
[SPEAKER_10]: Little Buckner and Garcia?

01:28:11.078 --> 01:28:11.539
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, of course.

01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:17.566
[SPEAKER_10]: They did a song called The Defender on that album.

01:28:18.988 --> 01:28:22.011
[SPEAKER_10]: And Beastie Boys actually referred to it in Body Movin'.

01:28:22.892 --> 01:28:23.853
[SPEAKER_10]: Because Beastie Boys are awesome.

01:28:25.294 --> 01:28:32.219
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I mean, and if you think about this, how many other games do we have come out since then that... Like, my favorite game, Fantasy Zone.

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:34.601
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that not pretty much Defender?

01:28:35.742 --> 01:28:36.182
[SPEAKER_03]: Inspired.

01:28:36.242 --> 01:28:37.583
[SPEAKER_03]: Heavily inspired, yes.

01:28:37.603 --> 01:28:38.364
[SPEAKER_10]: With cutesiness?

01:28:40.165 --> 01:28:47.371
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, we had... And of course, this, you know, basically opened the door to all kinds of other games, like GORF and Phoenix.

01:28:48.672 --> 01:28:48.932
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

01:28:50.658 --> 01:28:51.700
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:29:03.911 --> 01:29:09.454
[SPEAKER_03]: Some folks in chat, by the way, talking about Defender 2 on the NES, which was Stargate.

01:29:09.615 --> 01:29:16.819
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as other home versions came out, like Defense Command, Repton, Drop Zone, Protector 2, that copied the design.

01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:26.085
[SPEAKER_10]: Chopper Command for the Atari 2600 and Choplifter for Apple II were, again, mimics of Defender.

01:29:26.105 --> 01:29:26.845
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even think about that.

01:29:26.885 --> 01:29:27.205
[SPEAKER_03]: You're right.

01:29:27.225 --> 01:29:28.967
[SPEAKER_03]: Chopper Command really was the same damn game.

01:29:29.407 --> 01:29:30.868
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember my friend owned that.

01:29:31.488 --> 01:29:31.849
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

01:29:48.857 --> 01:29:53.158
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I just wanted to look really quickly at a chopper command here on the Atari 2600.

01:29:53.298 --> 01:29:55.979
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, see?

01:29:56.420 --> 01:29:58.080
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to protect your dudes on the bottom.

01:29:58.180 --> 01:29:59.320
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, little trucks on the bottom.

01:30:00.681 --> 01:30:02.001
[SPEAKER_03]: Did they get lifted up by the choppers?

01:30:02.101 --> 01:30:03.522
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot how that worked.

01:30:04.762 --> 01:30:06.363
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no, they're just getting... That's the difference.

01:30:06.383 --> 01:30:07.143
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't get lifted up.

01:30:07.183 --> 01:30:08.523
[SPEAKER_03]: They just get attacked.

01:30:08.583 --> 01:30:11.123
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to save the little astronauts in Defender.

01:30:11.564 --> 01:30:12.964
[SPEAKER_03]: That guy's not very good at chopper command.

01:30:14.664 --> 01:30:27.467
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway, I mean... And then in 2002, there was the sequel that was just called Defender that was...

01:30:29.728 --> 01:30:32.830
[SPEAKER_10]: and I believe the 3D that worked similarly.

01:30:34.311 --> 01:30:35.071
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, Defender.

01:30:35.692 --> 01:30:37.913
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is, your classic game of the week, Defender.

01:30:38.574 --> 01:30:39.034
[SPEAKER_10]: Good choice.

01:30:39.114 --> 01:30:41.476
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I actually really do need to get a hold of Steve Ritchie.

01:30:42.677 --> 01:30:46.900
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, that's going to do it for part A of Orange Lounge Radio but don't go anywhere.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:57.627
[SPEAKER_03]: Part B is coming up next here on VOG and we're going to start off with some big news in part B so I hope you guys don't go anywhere because we'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:31:03.533 --> 01:31:12.317
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio on our inaugural broadcast here on the VOG, vognetwork.com, the Voice of Geeks Network.

01:31:12.478 --> 01:31:15.219
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now, just three shows on the actual radio network.

01:31:15.319 --> 01:31:21.222
[SPEAKER_03]: VOG Network will be more than just a radio station, but that's the centerpiece of the dinner table right now is the radio station.

01:31:21.862 --> 01:31:27.685
[SPEAKER_03]: Just ourselves and Bobby Blackwolf, who you heard before us, and the great folks at Under Sedation Live in their 11th year.

01:31:29.766 --> 01:31:32.428
[SPEAKER_03]: God bless them or whatever you believe in.

01:31:33.628 --> 01:31:37.271
[SPEAKER_03]: 8 o'clock on Saturday, Pacific, 11 o'clock Eastern.

01:31:37.351 --> 01:31:40.192
[SPEAKER_03]: They're late night because they're dirty, but it's a good time.

01:31:40.212 --> 01:31:40.673
[SPEAKER_03]: They're dirty.

01:31:40.693 --> 01:31:42.414
[SPEAKER_03]: They're a little dirty, but it's a good time.

01:31:42.834 --> 01:31:43.954
[SPEAKER_03]: You should definitely tune in.

01:31:44.094 --> 01:31:46.076
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll say this because I know Jessica's in the chat right now.

01:31:46.396 --> 01:31:49.378
[SPEAKER_03]: Jessica will whip Travis into shape on Saturday night.

01:31:49.858 --> 01:31:53.640
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to hear him get a whooping, tune in on Saturday.

01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:54.961
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it is a really good time.

01:31:55.901 --> 01:31:58.902
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, anyhow, I gotta go back on that show and guess sometime, for sure.

01:31:59.083 --> 01:32:06.706
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we are here and, uh, talking about video games and, thank God, some late-breaking news.

01:32:06.806 --> 01:32:10.868
[SPEAKER_03]: Some late-breaking news here on the VOG and Orange Lounge Radio. 🎵

01:32:20.772 --> 01:32:25.515
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, our breaking news, and we have to go to our correspondent for this story.

01:32:25.555 --> 01:32:26.776
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't even my thing.

01:32:27.697 --> 01:32:33.680
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to go to our correspondent for this story, so I'm looking him up to give him a call right now.

01:32:35.241 --> 01:32:35.742
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there he is.

01:32:35.862 --> 01:32:37.203
[SPEAKER_03]: I always look under the wrong name here.

01:32:37.223 --> 01:32:42.666
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's give our correspondent a little call here so we can talk about the breaking news this evening.

01:32:43.607 --> 01:32:45.868
[SPEAKER_03]: All the way in New York City, Ranma is joining us.

01:32:45.908 --> 01:32:46.569
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Ranma, you there?

01:32:47.116 --> 01:32:48.137
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I'm right here, Scott.

01:32:48.157 --> 01:32:49.939
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you guys out in the Sacramento studios?

01:32:50.219 --> 01:32:57.507
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm relieved because the show is actually online tonight because, trust me, there was a plan B in case VOG didn't work.

01:32:57.847 --> 01:32:58.448
[SPEAKER_03]: But it works.

01:32:58.488 --> 01:33:02.913
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, despite the hiccup earlier that was a Comcast fail, shit, we're used to those.

01:33:03.713 --> 01:33:06.476
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had 10 years of those on the other networks we've been in.

01:33:06.917 --> 01:33:08.879
[SPEAKER_03]: So otherwise, VOG's working great.

01:33:08.959 --> 01:33:09.900
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got to say this.

01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:12.481
[SPEAKER_03]: I am so happy.

01:33:12.521 --> 01:33:13.321
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't even tell you.

01:33:13.741 --> 01:33:19.063
[SPEAKER_03]: We have hit higher numbers tonight on this new network than I've seen in a long, long, long time.

01:33:19.103 --> 01:33:29.027
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think a lot of that really is just the combined forces of Bobby's audience and our audience and the curious looky-loos, the people that Geek Life brought in, just all kind of joining together tonight.

01:33:29.207 --> 01:33:30.708
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just so happy.

01:33:31.028 --> 01:33:33.069
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope the momentum continues through the few weeks.

01:33:33.829 --> 01:33:34.789
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all for that.

01:33:35.029 --> 01:33:35.529
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, me too.

01:33:35.850 --> 01:33:38.330
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, you're not calling us to talk about VOG tonight.

01:33:38.370 --> 01:33:40.711
[SPEAKER_03]: You have some news for us, I guess you've become privy to.

01:33:40.751 --> 01:33:41.671
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on, Ranma?

01:33:41.731 --> 01:33:43.031
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes, yes, I do have news.

01:33:43.191 --> 01:33:50.793
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, recently with Anime Jam Session, we've gotten connected to another podcast out here called the Brooklyn Otaku.

01:33:51.133 --> 01:33:53.634
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been joining forces and working on some projects.

01:33:54.094 --> 01:34:01.616
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, one of the hosts of the Brooklyn Otaku hooked me up with some very privy information today at the Sakura Matsuri.

01:34:02.929 --> 01:34:03.289
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

01:34:03.709 --> 01:34:30.936
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, Sakura Matsuri Cherry Blossom Festival I was going to let him explain, but that's alright There he goes, fair enough So, Sakura Matsuri, you ran into your friends at Brooklyn Otaku and One of the hosts there has told me that the return of one of the greatest arcades in New York City will be back Chinatown Fair is reopening this Friday

01:34:31.636 --> 01:34:34.359
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay, Chinatown Fair reopening this Friday.

01:34:34.399 --> 01:34:35.801
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never been to Chinatown Fair.

01:34:36.602 --> 01:34:43.590
[SPEAKER_03]: The legendary arcade in these parts was Arcade Infinity, which when I say in these parts, I mean six hours away.

01:34:44.051 --> 01:34:46.374
[SPEAKER_03]: But what makes Chinatown Fair so special?

01:34:46.414 --> 01:34:48.236
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is this big news for the East Coast folks?

01:34:49.091 --> 01:34:51.793
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the bastion of arcade gaming.

01:34:51.833 --> 01:34:58.237
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like this is where you go to play all the greatest, at the time, fighting games, dancing games, all types of video games.

01:34:58.257 --> 01:34:59.758
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where you came.

01:34:59.838 --> 01:35:07.764
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like nowhere else in New York City you could go except here because it was quiet or loud, however you want to take it, and it was fun.

01:35:08.044 --> 01:35:12.227
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, there was also a chicken that could tell you fortune.

01:35:13.448 --> 01:35:13.648
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:35:16.554 --> 01:35:28.204
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't go to any of the other shops around there, so they could have had fortune-telling chickens.

01:35:29.385 --> 01:35:35.771
[SPEAKER_02]: I do believe the grand opening will be this Friday, and from my understanding, they're changing things around a little bit.

01:35:35.791 --> 01:35:40.315
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be more of a Chuck E. Cheese, Dave & Buster style place.

01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:45.341
[SPEAKER_03]: I shudder when I hear Chuck E. Cheese, but Dave and Buster, does that mean they're selling booze?

01:35:45.822 --> 01:35:48.991
[SPEAKER_03]: Exclusive Chinatown Fair to carry booze in the parking lot.

01:35:49.836 --> 01:35:50.837
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope so.

01:35:51.577 --> 01:35:55.620
[SPEAKER_02]: I do believe I'll be going down there Friday after work to check it out and see what's going on.

01:35:55.780 --> 01:36:02.744
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then I need pics and stuff for the VOG website feature stuff that will come later.

01:36:03.525 --> 01:36:04.305
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, definitely.

01:36:05.066 --> 01:36:08.348
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that would be great.

01:36:09.168 --> 01:36:11.970
[SPEAKER_03]: Exclusive kids band from the new Chinatown Fair.

01:36:12.050 --> 01:36:12.471
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.

01:36:12.531 --> 01:36:12.871
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.

01:36:13.450 --> 01:36:36.102
[SPEAKER_02]: well they were kind of sort of banned before pretty much if you were in school and you were there during school hours you were escorted out of the place but I've never been there during those times to see if they actually enforce that rule alright well thank you for sharing the news with us Ranma and thanks to your friends at the other show too since we have you on the line I know you like to call in during the show later anyway is there anything else you want to share with us tonight about your week?

01:36:38.743 --> 01:36:42.365
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah but how about I save that for that portion of the show

01:36:43.458 --> 01:36:44.058
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, then.

01:36:44.518 --> 01:36:46.339
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we'll wait for that call later on.

01:36:46.799 --> 01:36:49.020
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I can't make it on, I can't make it on.

01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:51.140
[SPEAKER_02]: It is what it is, because we have a lot of new listeners.

01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:51.440
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

01:36:51.460 --> 01:36:53.421
[SPEAKER_02]: We also let the fresh blood in, you know?

01:36:53.481 --> 01:36:55.721
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you got to let other people have a turn once in a while, Ranma.

01:36:55.761 --> 01:36:57.022
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, take care, buddy.

01:36:58.102 --> 01:36:59.062
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get back to the show.

01:37:01.283 --> 01:37:01.783
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, he hung up.

01:37:01.803 --> 01:37:02.143
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

01:37:02.383 --> 01:37:03.524
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, there it is, breaking news.

01:37:03.604 --> 01:37:05.324
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, breaking news exclusive.

01:37:05.444 --> 01:37:08.425
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki's mic was off that whole time, says the chatters.

01:37:08.445 --> 01:37:09.505
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, whatever.

01:37:10.105 --> 01:37:10.525
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we hear you?

01:37:10.565 --> 01:37:11.266
[SPEAKER_03]: I still can't hear you.

01:37:12.186 --> 01:37:12.466
[SPEAKER_03]: Is your mic on?

01:37:13.591 --> 01:37:14.092
[SPEAKER_10]: Is mine on?

01:37:15.054 --> 01:37:15.816
[SPEAKER_10]: I hear my voice.

01:37:18.441 --> 01:37:20.705
[SPEAKER_03]: Your mic is... Talk for a minute for me.

01:37:24.779 --> 01:37:25.620
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God.

01:37:26.180 --> 01:37:27.922
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't you, you didn't fiddle with anything over here?

01:37:28.202 --> 01:37:28.802
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

01:37:29.163 --> 01:37:29.263
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

01:37:29.383 --> 01:37:31.205
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob had one mute.

01:37:31.245 --> 01:37:34.527
[SPEAKER_04]: You fiddled with my microphone, you bastard.

01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:39.311
[SPEAKER_04]: I had nothing intelligent to interject.

01:37:39.372 --> 01:37:43.215
[SPEAKER_10]: And the fail award of the evening goes to Rob for mute button fail.

01:37:46.505 --> 01:37:47.726
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I'd fiddle the microphone.

01:37:47.746 --> 01:37:48.266
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think I'd do?

01:37:48.426 --> 01:37:49.126
[SPEAKER_11]: Hey!

01:37:49.146 --> 01:37:50.067
[SPEAKER_11]: Scords!

01:37:50.247 --> 01:37:51.627
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna take on those!

01:37:52.167 --> 01:37:55.168
[SPEAKER_11]: He's gonna pretend he's Sanrio and chew on them.

01:37:57.129 --> 01:37:57.829
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, whatever.

01:37:58.029 --> 01:38:01.511
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna hop up on the table and Rage!

01:38:01.571 --> 01:38:02.211
[SPEAKER_03]: Throw the like...

01:38:03.266 --> 01:38:05.288
[SPEAKER_10]: So Rob, this coffee is delicious.

01:38:05.408 --> 01:38:05.728
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

01:38:06.089 --> 01:38:06.589
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're welcome.

01:38:06.629 --> 01:38:06.809
[SPEAKER_03]: Anytime.

01:38:06.869 --> 01:38:09.271
[SPEAKER_10]: I've just put up two pictures on the OLR website.

01:38:09.311 --> 01:38:10.492
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, that's what they wanted to see.

01:38:10.653 --> 01:38:12.875
[SPEAKER_10]: One of them was coffee and the other one was my mouse pad.

01:38:12.895 --> 01:38:13.535
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I'll take it.

01:38:13.555 --> 01:38:16.157
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, we're going to get to rapid fire news, but sure, I'll take a question.

01:38:16.258 --> 01:38:17.859
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the show where every gamer has a voice.

01:38:18.219 --> 01:38:22.343
[SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes we get thrown random ass questions in the VOG chat room and I'll answer them.

01:38:22.523 --> 01:38:26.447
[SPEAKER_03]: Nietzsche, OLR, did you guys happen to play any of the Diablo 3 open beta?

01:38:26.647 --> 01:38:27.948
[SPEAKER_03]: If so, what class did you play?

01:38:28.248 --> 01:38:28.648
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell no.

01:38:28.808 --> 01:38:34.271
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't play the open beta, but I played the closed beta back in October and I played a monk and it was a lot of fun.

01:38:34.311 --> 01:38:36.813
[SPEAKER_03]: I played monk and witch doctor and I really preferred monk.

01:38:37.393 --> 01:38:38.554
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a good time.

01:38:38.814 --> 01:38:40.054
[SPEAKER_10]: I called witch doctor.

01:38:41.595 --> 01:38:42.876
[SPEAKER_04]: It looked interesting.

01:38:42.916 --> 01:38:45.978
[SPEAKER_04]: I played the original Diablo and I had fun with that.

01:38:46.418 --> 01:38:48.199
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not play any of the betas.

01:38:48.459 --> 01:38:56.226
[SPEAKER_04]: I got invited to the beta for Mists of Pandaria, but I don't play WoW, so I have no interest in that.

01:38:56.587 --> 01:38:59.610
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone pretty much got invited in the last wave.

01:38:59.990 --> 01:39:01.211
[SPEAKER_03]: Rapid fire news.

01:39:01.271 --> 01:39:02.592
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get to it, Loki.

01:39:02.873 --> 01:39:04.034
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is interesting.

01:39:04.114 --> 01:39:06.176
[SPEAKER_04]: Joyride is getting a sequel.

01:39:07.797 --> 01:39:08.078
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

01:39:08.238 --> 01:39:10.360
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't a very fun game.

01:39:25.818 --> 01:39:46.084
[SPEAKER_04]: and apparently we'll have absolutely no Kinect support whatsoever and it's going to be just standard controller support which is fine if you think about it because originally it was supposed to be just an Xbox Live Arcade title that was supposed to be free and then they were going to have a bunch of other crap that you could download and expand it with because it was going to be a free-to-play type thing.

01:39:46.104 --> 01:39:51.506
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to have an all-new stunt park and I guess you can do different stunts like jumping off cliffs and whatnot.

01:39:52.226 --> 01:39:54.087
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but that'll be coming out later on.

01:39:54.408 --> 01:40:00.611
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe if it's, you know, supposed to be in the summer or something, maybe a part of their summer thing that they're doing.

01:40:00.731 --> 01:40:01.692
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to be willing to bet.

01:40:02.533 --> 01:40:03.913
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know what?

01:40:04.033 --> 01:40:11.458
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, it sounds kind of interesting then if it is without, you know, Connect because Connect kind of hurt that game, but it could have been fun.

01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:16.021
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I'd be willing to check out the demo at least.

01:40:16.241 --> 01:40:17.342
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll check out the demo at least.

01:40:18.482 --> 01:40:18.963
[SPEAKER_04]: So, hmm.

01:40:19.123 --> 01:40:20.203
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

01:40:20.323 --> 01:40:28.568
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, something I really could care less about, or couldn't care less, I guess, Pikmin 2 is getting its new play control game on the Wii this June.

01:40:29.128 --> 01:40:42.476
[SPEAKER_04]: Now for those who may not remember, they did this thing called New Play Control way back in 2009 where they were taking some of these old GameCube games and adding some Wii support on top of them and that's about it.

01:40:42.616 --> 01:40:45.898
[SPEAKER_04]: And they had a couple games that came out and then they kind of stopped.

01:40:46.419 --> 01:40:49.701
[SPEAKER_04]: And this actually came out in Japan and Europe in 2009.

01:40:49.981 --> 01:40:53.303
[SPEAKER_04]: But for whatever reason they decided, hey, we're going to bring it out in the U.S.

01:40:53.403 --> 01:40:53.623
[SPEAKER_04]: now.

01:40:55.168 --> 01:40:58.513
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Nintendo, for bringing this to us.

01:41:04.915 --> 01:41:05.135
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

01:41:05.195 --> 01:41:05.995
[SPEAKER_03]: It's escaping me.

01:41:06.455 --> 01:41:09.136
[SPEAKER_04]: The last story is coming out, yes.

01:41:09.376 --> 01:41:10.736
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say Litterbox Chronicles.

01:41:11.397 --> 01:41:20.739
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the last story is coming out in June, but honestly, they haven't had a first party Wii title since, well, Mario Party 9 had been the last first party Wii title, and that was in the beginning of March.

01:41:22.519 --> 01:41:28.141
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they have the Pokemon Conquest game, which, you know, Dynasty Warriors cross Pokemon.

01:41:29.341 --> 01:41:51.776
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I'm, I'm curious, let's just put it that way, I'm a little curious Um, I just think it's kind of like, here, here you go, this is something that you really wanted So, so we gonna like, what is it, we gonna get the, fuck, I don't even remember the other games that have been released in other territories but not Are we gonna get Captain Rainbow at some point, you know?

01:41:52.097 --> 01:41:53.618
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they gonna like localize that?

01:41:53.638 --> 01:41:55.539
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is Captain Rainbow?

01:41:58.129 --> 01:42:10.579
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a game that came out in Japan that was... It was all these, like, old... What was the one with all the sexy men dudes that was, like, hole in the wall, basically?

01:42:10.599 --> 01:42:11.639
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that did come out here, didn't it?

01:42:11.659 --> 01:42:12.300
[SPEAKER_04]: That did come out here.

01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:15.202
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that came out here, but Captain Rainbow did not.

01:42:15.242 --> 01:42:18.585
[SPEAKER_04]: Captain Rainbow was the one that had, like, all of the misfit Nintendo characters.

01:42:19.085 --> 01:42:22.168
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, Birdo was in it and stuff like that, and it was just ridiculous.

01:42:24.389 --> 01:42:25.010
[SPEAKER_10]: I want that.

01:42:25.050 --> 01:42:25.970
[SPEAKER_04]: There's Birdo right there.

01:42:26.531 --> 01:42:26.951
[SPEAKER_10]: I want that.

01:42:26.971 --> 01:42:27.291
[SPEAKER_10]: I want that.

01:42:28.587 --> 01:42:34.031
[SPEAKER_10]: What are you playing as?

01:42:34.051 --> 01:42:36.332
[SPEAKER_03]: Captain Rainbow.

01:42:36.352 --> 01:42:37.573
[SPEAKER_03]: Captain Rainbow, dummy!

01:42:38.014 --> 01:42:38.214
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

01:42:38.274 --> 01:42:41.336
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, just this panned out thing, I was like, he's falcon punching.

01:42:41.356 --> 01:42:42.677
[SPEAKER_08]: His eyes are big flames.

01:42:49.041 --> 01:42:52.743
[SPEAKER_01]: He's doing rainbow things to that door.

01:42:54.964 --> 01:42:55.804
[SPEAKER_03]: He's plugging in.

01:42:55.944 --> 01:42:58.025
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they just think we wouldn't get it.

01:42:58.825 --> 01:42:59.385
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd play it.

01:43:00.406 --> 01:43:00.966
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

01:43:01.086 --> 01:43:01.966
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really weird.

01:43:02.326 --> 01:43:05.447
[SPEAKER_04]: But there was another game, though, that was...

01:43:07.168 --> 01:43:10.249
[SPEAKER_04]: and I don't remember for the life of me what the hell it was called.

01:43:10.289 --> 01:43:13.990
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like Disaster Day and Crisis or something like that, I think.

01:43:14.050 --> 01:43:15.311
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what else we don't have here?

01:43:15.591 --> 01:43:17.932
[SPEAKER_03]: Tingle's Adventure or whatever that game was.

01:43:18.192 --> 01:43:19.852
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's because it sucked.

01:43:20.412 --> 01:43:21.813
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, no Tingle game here.

01:43:24.063 --> 01:43:25.123
[SPEAKER_03]: They got the postcards!

01:43:25.143 --> 01:43:28.624
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the new franchise Nintendo needs to explore, Tingle.

01:43:29.044 --> 01:43:30.084
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen, no they don't.

01:43:30.464 --> 01:43:32.165
[SPEAKER_04]: He is a really fucking annoying character.

01:43:32.745 --> 01:43:36.746
[SPEAKER_04]: We do not need to bring this crap back up.

01:43:36.766 --> 01:43:38.026
[SPEAKER_04]: Tingle's Epic Quest.

01:43:40.746 --> 01:43:41.446
[SPEAKER_04]: Epic Tingle.

01:43:41.827 --> 01:43:42.667
[SPEAKER_04]: I will tell you what.

01:43:42.747 --> 01:43:45.387
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what, I think Epic Tingle would be a better game.

01:43:45.607 --> 01:43:49.048
[SPEAKER_04]: If they launch the Wii U with a Tingle game, I will buy that system.

01:43:50.094 --> 01:43:52.279
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I thought you were going to say you'd dress up finally.

01:43:52.559 --> 01:43:52.619
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

01:43:52.639 --> 01:43:54.423
[SPEAKER_03]: The bet we've been trying to get forever.

01:43:54.723 --> 01:43:58.772
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, that would actually be like the easiest costume ever because all you have to do is like sweats and a hoodie.

01:43:59.032 --> 01:43:59.373
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:44:00.979 --> 01:44:03.681
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on, do you have any other rapid fire news or is that it?

01:44:04.502 --> 01:44:10.626
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I got one more and that's a little bit better and I'm sure this may actually sell some Vitas for some people.

01:44:10.967 --> 01:44:22.976
[SPEAKER_04]: DGMax Technica Tune is actually coming out to the North America region for the Vita this summer and it looks pretty awesome.

01:44:22.996 --> 01:44:24.357
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks just like the arcade stuff.

01:44:27.523 --> 01:44:27.923
[SPEAKER_03]: Valuesoft

01:44:51.132 --> 01:44:53.073
[SPEAKER_03]: You may not know what ValueSoft is.

01:44:53.354 --> 01:44:54.815
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm well aware of ValueSoft.

01:44:54.855 --> 01:44:56.716
[SPEAKER_03]: They make budget PC games.

01:44:57.977 --> 01:44:58.977
[SPEAKER_04]: Budget Wii games, too.

01:44:58.997 --> 01:45:02.380
[SPEAKER_03]: $10 rack at Target of PC games and all that.

01:45:03.420 --> 01:45:05.061
[SPEAKER_03]: These games are in there.

01:45:05.101 --> 01:45:07.263
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see the room by Activision at one time.

01:45:07.703 --> 01:45:11.427
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, but they're not going to be run by THQ anymore because they just sold it off.

01:45:12.228 --> 01:45:14.450
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, they are the second largest U.S.

01:45:14.510 --> 01:45:17.574
[SPEAKER_03]: retail publisher of PC games in terms of units sold.

01:45:17.614 --> 01:45:18.274
[SPEAKER_03]: I have no idea.

01:45:18.895 --> 01:45:22.779
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyhow, I guess what is happening... Oh, no, I'm sorry.

01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:27.965
[SPEAKER_03]: Cosme is buying them, and together it will make them the second largest U.S.

01:45:28.025 --> 01:45:28.886
[SPEAKER_03]: retail publisher.

01:45:29.486 --> 01:45:30.267
[SPEAKER_03]: So I see where it is.

01:45:30.307 --> 01:45:34.329
[SPEAKER_03]: So ValueSoft wasn't, but now they will be with Cosme, who they've sold it to.

01:45:34.510 --> 01:45:37.572
[SPEAKER_04]: To be fair, they do have their purpose in the industry.

01:45:37.612 --> 01:45:49.920
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you know, seriously, if you're having a game that you're putting out that maybe is not that great, and not necessarily that it's not that great, but at least there's a publisher out there for your independent game if you really want to do it.

01:45:49.940 --> 01:45:53.143
[SPEAKER_03]: So if OLR, the game, ever becomes a reality, maybe on ValueSoft, right?

01:45:54.483 --> 01:45:55.484
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:45:55.624 --> 01:45:56.425
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:45:56.725 --> 01:45:57.886
[SPEAKER_04]: Digital is probably the better way to go.

01:45:58.522 --> 01:46:06.213
[SPEAKER_03]: So heads up to those folks that play games like City of Heroes, Champions Online, and Star Trek Online, which would be DarkSakura.

01:46:06.293 --> 01:46:09.717
[SPEAKER_03]: Cryptic Studios found out that their systems have been hacked.

01:46:10.418 --> 01:46:10.979
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:14.204
[SPEAKER_03]: They were hacked in December of 2010.

01:46:16.516 --> 01:46:17.016
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not very routine.

01:46:36.901 --> 01:46:37.942
[SPEAKER_04]: Once every two years.

01:46:38.722 --> 01:46:43.065
[SPEAKER_03]: Account information, including passwords, may have been accessed by an unauthorized party.

01:46:43.105 --> 01:46:45.267
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, by now you probably would have had your account hacked.

01:46:45.627 --> 01:46:47.348
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's how they got into the Xboxes.

01:46:47.408 --> 01:46:49.850
[SPEAKER_10]: No crap happened to my account, just letting people know.

01:46:50.891 --> 01:46:53.993
[SPEAKER_10]: I logged in and everything was still there.

01:46:54.313 --> 01:46:55.294
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, those hackers are good.

01:46:55.314 --> 01:46:57.475
[SPEAKER_04]: They turned Star Trek to free-to-play.

01:46:57.796 --> 01:46:58.336
[SPEAKER_04]: They're pretty good.

01:46:59.969 --> 01:47:01.451
[SPEAKER_11]: I spent an hour playing Dabo.

01:47:01.691 --> 01:47:06.414
[SPEAKER_03]: Yet another great tip to change your passwords and use unique passwords on every site.

01:47:07.555 --> 01:47:14.020
[SPEAKER_04]: And it says that your network provider checks their security logs more than once every 16 months.

01:47:14.841 --> 01:47:19.744
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, and last but not least for my rapid fire news, Adam Sessler left G4.

01:47:21.385 --> 01:47:22.045
[SPEAKER_04]: Good for him.

01:47:23.306 --> 01:47:23.846
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

01:47:24.306 --> 01:47:25.546
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I understand.

01:47:26.427 --> 01:47:28.547
[SPEAKER_04]: You may be joking, but you know what?

01:47:28.987 --> 01:47:33.929
[SPEAKER_04]: That guy, sadly, he was one of the good things from G4.

01:47:34.049 --> 01:47:41.391
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, one of the good things left on G4 and one of the good things from Tech TV back when they were around.

01:47:43.051 --> 01:47:43.871
[SPEAKER_04]: Bravo to him.

01:47:43.931 --> 01:47:46.312
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually moving on to probably some better waters.

01:47:46.372 --> 01:47:46.612
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean...

01:47:47.225 --> 01:47:50.887
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why the game blogs feel the need to continually cover G4.

01:47:51.988 --> 01:47:54.129
[SPEAKER_03]: G4 is not a gaming network and hasn't been for some time.

01:47:54.149 --> 01:47:55.289
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that they're covering G4.

01:47:55.369 --> 01:47:56.710
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're talking about Adam Sessler.

01:47:56.770 --> 01:47:58.971
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they care a rat's ass about G4.

01:47:59.011 --> 01:48:01.373
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they care about Adam Sessler.

01:48:01.513 --> 01:48:03.774
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one response for that, Rob.

01:48:06.635 --> 01:48:07.396
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you kill a fly?

01:48:09.277 --> 01:48:32.889
[SPEAKER_03]: I think people maybe are hoping that he's going somewhere that will actually be gaming related but it is important to say apparently it was a contract dispute that got him out and Comcast who owns G4 I'm sure wants to save money anywhere they can and probably doesn't throw a lot of money at a network that some didn't DirecTV threaten to pull the plug on G4 or maybe they already did

01:48:33.309 --> 01:48:35.370
[SPEAKER_04]: Listen, we have enough cheater and cops reruns.

01:48:35.390 --> 01:48:36.910
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't need you guys around.

01:48:37.411 --> 01:48:43.253
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, G4, to me, seems like a network that would be better suited for the internet.

01:48:43.573 --> 01:48:44.093
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?

01:48:44.153 --> 01:48:49.535
[SPEAKER_04]: Just having digital content on the internet because they don't have much content to begin with.

01:48:49.835 --> 01:48:53.296
[SPEAKER_04]: It's literally cops and cheaters reruns all the fucking time.

01:48:53.316 --> 01:48:54.617
[SPEAKER_11]: But the internet doesn't need them now.

01:48:54.637 --> 01:48:55.117
[SPEAKER_11]: They have us.

01:48:56.337 --> 01:49:00.040
[SPEAKER_03]: And in fact, there's several folks in the chatroom that say, Sessler should come to VOG.

01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:02.601
[SPEAKER_03]: The door is open.

01:49:02.621 --> 01:49:04.622
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love to interview Adam Sessler.

01:49:04.642 --> 01:49:05.643
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't pay you, though.

01:49:05.663 --> 01:49:06.924
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't pay him in Starbucks.

01:49:07.384 --> 01:49:07.944
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

01:49:09.045 --> 01:49:11.506
[SPEAKER_04]: He will probably be getting less money than you're getting with G4.

01:49:13.447 --> 01:49:34.440
[SPEAKER_03]: some folks seem to think he could go to Polygon again this is all rampant speculation because you know he I don't think he was planning on leaving he thought the contracts would go through but they didn't Polygon of course is that whole kind of Voltron of the guy who used to be the editor in chief of Kotaku and the like three editor guys from Joystick and a bunch of people all coming together for that one so

01:49:36.901 --> 01:49:39.282
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyhow, he's gone.

01:49:40.403 --> 01:49:42.844
[SPEAKER_03]: And G4 takes one more step away from gaming.

01:49:43.684 --> 01:49:44.605
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on, DarkSakura.

01:49:45.945 --> 01:49:48.747
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, moving... No, we won't pay him in Pinkberry.

01:49:48.787 --> 01:49:49.827
[SPEAKER_10]: That Pinkberry's for us.

01:49:50.347 --> 01:49:50.748
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

01:49:50.788 --> 01:49:51.988
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not giving up my Pinkberry.

01:49:52.148 --> 01:49:52.529
[SPEAKER_03]: Hell no.

01:49:52.629 --> 01:49:54.069
[SPEAKER_04]: He can have my portion of Pinkberry.

01:49:54.089 --> 01:49:54.369
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

01:49:54.409 --> 01:49:55.550
[SPEAKER_03]: He can have the peach Pinkberry.

01:49:55.790 --> 01:49:59.552
[SPEAKER_10]: You can have the peach, all the peach, and the lychee shit when it comes back.

01:49:59.832 --> 01:50:01.213
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, you can have the lychee too.

01:50:02.333 --> 01:50:09.780
[SPEAKER_10]: So, the Perpetual Testing Initiative DLC for Portal 2 will be available for PC and Mac on May 8th.

01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:13.063
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm downloading the shit out of it!

01:50:13.143 --> 01:50:16.686
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's nothing saying about it being on any of the consoles.

01:50:17.894 --> 01:50:18.534
[SPEAKER_04]: I second that.

01:50:18.594 --> 01:50:25.216
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I haven't redeemed my copy of Portal 2 for the PC on my Steam thing that came with the PS3 version.

01:50:25.236 --> 01:50:28.316
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it might have had an expiration date, so you might want to look into that.

01:50:28.376 --> 01:50:28.756
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn it!

01:50:29.077 --> 01:50:29.977
[SPEAKER_03]: You better be careful.

01:50:30.077 --> 01:50:30.517
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

01:50:31.917 --> 01:50:33.317
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like super cheap anyway now.

01:50:33.758 --> 01:50:33.998
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

01:50:34.998 --> 01:50:43.420
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'm totally going to be writing a review on that when I download it because, you know, my favorite thing to do in Sims 3 was build houses.

01:50:43.860 --> 01:50:45.400
[SPEAKER_10]: Now I'll be building tests.

01:50:47.833 --> 01:50:49.214
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you like to play a game?

01:50:49.514 --> 01:50:49.954
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, God.

01:50:50.874 --> 01:50:59.057
[SPEAKER_10]: So, for Dragon Quest fans, Dragon Quest X, which is the Wii... Sorry, I'm just imagining your dream OLR Studios level.

01:51:00.438 --> 01:51:02.419
[SPEAKER_03]: With Loki and I in perpetual fall.

01:51:03.919 --> 01:51:04.419
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, my God.

01:51:04.459 --> 01:51:06.520
[SPEAKER_10]: You guys would be the perfect Atlas and Peabody.

01:51:07.761 --> 01:51:09.241
[SPEAKER_10]: That should be your cosplay as Atlas and Peabody.

01:51:09.261 --> 01:51:10.102
[SPEAKER_03]: I know who's Atlas.

01:51:12.883 --> 01:51:13.503
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

01:51:13.988 --> 01:51:26.237
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyway, for Dragon Quest fans, Dragon Quest X, which is the MMO, launching in Japan on August 2nd, Squeenix has told everybody.

01:51:26.437 --> 01:51:32.541
[SPEAKER_10]: It will be, for the actual disc, is 6980 yen, which is about 86 bucks.

01:51:33.461 --> 01:51:34.722
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's 20 days of free play.

01:51:35.143 --> 01:51:39.906
[SPEAKER_10]: It will include a USB memory stick for an extra 2000 yen, and like 23 bucks here.

01:51:41.987 --> 01:51:46.270
[SPEAKER_10]: And there is going to be a Wii U version, but they have no details on this one.

01:51:46.810 --> 01:51:53.073
[SPEAKER_10]: The subscription fee is 1,000 yen, basically 1,235 in US dollars.

01:51:53.714 --> 01:51:56.856
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's a 30-day voucher that gets you to play up to three characters.

01:51:56.876 --> 01:51:57.656
[SPEAKER_10]: 60 days is 1,950.

01:51:57.696 --> 01:51:58.356
[SPEAKER_10]: 90 days will be 2,900.

01:52:03.143 --> 01:52:03.543
[SPEAKER_03]: Dragon Quest X

01:52:34.016 --> 01:52:36.597
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh god, I hope Versus makes the holiday this year.

01:52:36.997 --> 01:52:38.817
[SPEAKER_10]: I really want Zero to come out over here.

01:52:39.818 --> 01:52:40.378
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah!

01:52:41.438 --> 01:52:42.798
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I want to play the hell out of that.

01:52:43.038 --> 01:52:44.199
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's talk about Final Fantasy XV.

01:52:44.219 --> 01:52:47.360
[SPEAKER_10]: How about my last bit for rapid fire news?

01:52:48.260 --> 01:52:49.560
[SPEAKER_10]: Silent Hill Downpour.

01:52:50.380 --> 01:52:52.441
[SPEAKER_10]: There actually is a patch.

01:52:53.041 --> 01:52:54.381
[SPEAKER_10]: There's two patch announcements.

01:52:54.862 --> 01:52:59.783
[SPEAKER_10]: One for Silent Hill Downpour and then we have Silent Hill HD Collection to fix the frame rate problems.

01:53:00.443 --> 01:53:04.807
[SPEAKER_10]: Audio Sinking and Downpour, and the Autosave in the Silent Hill HD Collection.

01:53:05.828 --> 01:53:09.671
[SPEAKER_10]: And they should be coming out, and the quote is, in the coming weeks.

01:53:11.113 --> 01:53:16.177
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's no patch yet to make a Silent Hill HD Collection good.

01:53:17.318 --> 01:53:20.040
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we should spend a little bit more time on figuring out how fog works.

01:53:20.060 --> 01:53:21.141
[SPEAKER_04]: Fog is hard.

01:53:21.201 --> 01:53:21.982
[SPEAKER_04]: Fog is hard.

01:53:24.955 --> 01:53:26.917
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like, come on.

01:53:27.517 --> 01:53:28.238
[SPEAKER_04]: Silent Hill.

01:53:28.959 --> 01:53:30.180
[SPEAKER_04]: The monsters don't work.

01:53:30.600 --> 01:53:32.042
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's just release it anyways.

01:53:32.742 --> 01:53:35.745
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's about as integral as the fog.

01:53:35.945 --> 01:53:37.326
[SPEAKER_04]: The fog is kind of important there.

01:53:38.848 --> 01:53:40.830
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's go to the Fugle Question of the Week.

01:53:40.850 --> 01:53:44.153
[SPEAKER_03]: We've kind of missed this the past couple weeks, so I think it's time we get to the Fugle Question of the Week.

01:53:44.173 --> 01:53:45.234
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't missed it at all.

01:53:45.674 --> 01:53:46.535
[SPEAKER_03]: Why haven't you missed it?

01:53:46.655 --> 01:53:47.416
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you hating on the Fugle?

01:53:47.436 --> 01:53:49.558
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm being a bitch.

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.982
[SPEAKER_03]: Except, oops, I didn't have the Fugle theme song up tonight.

01:53:53.163 --> 01:53:53.723
[SPEAKER_03]: Shame on me.

01:53:53.823 --> 01:53:54.223
[SPEAKER_10]: Fail.

01:53:54.284 --> 01:53:54.744
[SPEAKER_10]: Fired.

01:53:55.144 --> 01:53:56.685
[SPEAKER_10]: We're hiring Adam Sessler, Rob.

01:53:58.267 --> 01:53:58.847
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys would fire me.

01:53:58.927 --> 01:54:01.089
[SPEAKER_10]: Exclusive Adam Sessler to replace Rob.

01:54:01.830 --> 01:54:02.290
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is.

01:54:02.330 --> 01:54:02.750
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.

01:54:02.991 --> 01:54:03.871
[SPEAKER_12]: Fugle Music.

01:54:05.072 --> 01:54:05.733
[SPEAKER_03]: Fugle!

01:54:05.913 --> 01:54:10.076
[SPEAKER_03]: Every week on our Facebook community and our Google Plus community, we ask a question and get your answers.

01:54:10.237 --> 01:54:12.198
[SPEAKER_03]: Combine Facebook and Google and you get Fugle.

01:54:12.358 --> 01:54:13.779
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it's our Fugle Question of the Week.

01:54:13.799 --> 01:54:14.240
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.

01:54:14.784 --> 01:54:17.005
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that Sony has announced their own Smash Bros.

01:54:17.045 --> 01:54:20.006
[SPEAKER_03]: style game, should Microsoft start working on one?

01:54:20.546 --> 01:54:23.007
[SPEAKER_03]: Why or why not wouldn't this be a good idea?

01:54:24.107 --> 01:54:26.688
[SPEAKER_03]: If you think it's a good idea, what character would you most want to see in the game?

01:54:27.068 --> 01:54:30.289
[SPEAKER_03]: We got one answer on Google+, so there are people using Google+.

01:54:30.349 --> 01:54:35.991
[SPEAKER_03]: Danny K says, I don't really think they have enough first party games to justify a game like that.

01:54:36.091 --> 01:54:41.132
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a theme we're seeing quite a bit through some of the answers going over to Facebook where we had lots of answers.

01:54:41.152 --> 01:54:42.853
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love this one from Bobby Blackwolf.

01:54:43.413 --> 01:55:06.184
[SPEAKER_03]: who posted a link to a picture on a NeoGAF forum of what an Xbox Super Smash Brothers game would look like and it's just a select screen for Xbox 360 Ultra Heroes Ultimate Fight and it's 15 different versions of Master Chief all in different colors and shapes on the select screen.

01:55:06.884 --> 01:55:10.306
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what this is missing though is the female Master Chief with a bow in her hair.

01:55:13.855 --> 01:55:14.414
[SPEAKER_03]: Mrs. Chief

01:55:17.862 --> 01:55:29.728
[SPEAKER_03]: Katsuhiko Janai says I don't want to play as Microsoft Bob or Clippy See, I like thinking, think outside the box Don't just make it the video games, make it all the Clippy would be awesome Is that thinking outside the Xbox?

01:55:31.589 --> 01:55:40.594
[SPEAKER_10]: Getting to kick the shit out of Clippy I think would sell Or the damn dog That ugly ass dog You know what character needs to be in the game, Rob?

01:55:40.674 --> 01:55:44.396
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, Comic Sans So I can beat the shit out of it

01:55:44.736 --> 01:55:44.996
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:55:45.637 --> 01:55:47.540
[SPEAKER_03]: Stan H says, I agree with Black Wolf.

01:55:47.580 --> 01:55:51.965
[SPEAKER_03]: Microsoft doesn't have enough first-party characters to fill a decent-sized roster for today's fighting game.

01:55:52.306 --> 01:55:58.914
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to have at least 15, and I can't think of anyone besides Master Chief and Milo, unless they have a Kinect that has legs and arms with boxing gloves on.

01:55:58.934 --> 01:55:59.675
[SPEAKER_03]: Milo, wow.

01:56:00.275 --> 01:56:02.077
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, that was funny.

01:56:03.798 --> 01:56:08.541
[SPEAKER_03]: James A. says, though, I must confess, I'd love to see Joanna Dark in such a game.

01:56:08.781 --> 01:56:09.562
[SPEAKER_03]: Cameo, too.

01:56:10.102 --> 01:56:11.323
[SPEAKER_03]: So some folks are starting to think of some others.

01:56:11.683 --> 01:56:23.292
[SPEAKER_03]: RedTheHayes says, no, even though Microsoft has far more popular titles with characters like Master Chief, they just don't have as much of a history to draw from like Sony or Nintendo since they're relatively new to the console gaming business.

01:56:23.672 --> 01:56:25.713
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a few recognizable characters to choose from.

01:56:25.753 --> 01:56:29.235
[SPEAKER_03]: They have Master Chief, Fable Dude, Gears of War characters.

01:56:29.915 --> 01:56:33.897
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing, most of the popular characters on the Xbox are from shooter games.

01:56:34.378 --> 01:56:36.739
[SPEAKER_03]: Throwing characters from shooter games into a Smash Bros.

01:56:36.779 --> 01:56:41.501
[SPEAKER_03]: type fighting might not go so well with the dude bro gamers who are primarily into the Xbox shooters.

01:56:42.262 --> 01:56:46.724
[SPEAKER_03]: Though if they ever made one, I would love to see the President and Vice President from Metal Wolf Chaos.

01:56:46.784 --> 01:56:48.145
[SPEAKER_03]: That would totally change my mind.

01:56:48.945 --> 01:56:50.166
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I like what Jim H. said.

01:56:51.496 --> 01:56:55.920
[SPEAKER_03]: They really, even if they don't, even if they can muster up a roster, they really don't make those kinds of games.

01:56:56.241 --> 01:56:57.502
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe an all-star shooter.

01:56:59.203 --> 01:57:03.267
[SPEAKER_03]: So like an all-star melee rampage in first person.

01:57:03.287 --> 01:57:07.371
[SPEAKER_10]: Just call it like a Microsoft... The Make Jamie Barf game.

01:57:07.391 --> 01:57:08.492
[SPEAKER_10]: Capture the flag.

01:57:08.512 --> 01:57:09.233
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

01:57:09.634 --> 01:57:10.114
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

01:57:12.064 --> 01:57:12.385
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

01:57:12.805 --> 01:57:14.747
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Giovedeo goes a different way with this.

01:57:15.368 --> 01:57:21.154
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, considering Nintendo was able to use Sonic and Snake, it doesn't have to be characters exclusive to Microsoft.

01:57:21.495 --> 01:57:23.297
[SPEAKER_03]: Just characters they're willing to pay money for.

01:57:23.637 --> 01:57:33.708
[SPEAKER_03]: And since there are games like Metal Gear, Final Fantasy XIII, Devil May Cry that have come into the Microsoft franchise, I can see them paying for the use of those characters as well as Microsoft exclusives.

01:57:34.248 --> 01:57:39.972
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, since it's Microsoft, perhaps a paperclip that fights with well-placed sarcastic comments and uses itself like a sword.

01:57:40.032 --> 01:57:43.695
[SPEAKER_04]: You're also forgetting the fact that there's Xbox Live Arcade.

01:57:43.735 --> 01:57:46.096
[SPEAKER_04]: There's plenty of shit on Xbox Live Arcade.

01:57:46.137 --> 01:57:46.637
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

01:57:46.857 --> 01:57:52.621
[SPEAKER_04]: You do Castle Crashers, you can have, you know, um... What was it, uh... You know what's funny?

01:57:52.701 --> 01:57:53.962
[SPEAKER_03]: Tony B said that.

01:57:54.222 --> 01:57:55.343
[SPEAKER_03]: Xbox Arcade characters.

01:57:55.683 --> 01:58:02.348
[SPEAKER_03]: Swap out Master Chief for Bastion, Tim from Braid, Knights from Castle Crashers, Dude from Plants from Zombies, Splosion Man...

01:58:04.237 --> 01:58:04.790
[SPEAKER_03]: So there you go.

01:58:06.347 --> 01:58:08.228
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Right says Microsoft owns Rare.

01:58:08.608 --> 01:58:09.829
[SPEAKER_03]: Rare has the Battletoads.

01:58:10.249 --> 01:58:10.870
[SPEAKER_03]: Think about it.

01:58:11.210 --> 01:58:16.733
[SPEAKER_10]: President Cat would not work, by the way, Tigerclaw, because that... Didn't Rare also do Killer Instinct?

01:58:17.433 --> 01:58:17.593
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

01:58:17.673 --> 01:58:19.434
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, but Nintendo technically owns that.

01:58:19.474 --> 01:58:19.974
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

01:58:20.034 --> 01:58:21.615
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do a new Battletoads game.

01:58:21.795 --> 01:58:23.276
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck any of this other shit.

01:58:23.316 --> 01:58:24.137
[SPEAKER_04]: Who gives a crap about this?

01:58:24.157 --> 01:58:25.897
[SPEAKER_10]: Battletoads is the devil.

01:58:26.558 --> 01:58:26.878
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

01:58:26.898 --> 01:58:27.939
[SPEAKER_10]: That game's freaking hard.

01:58:28.859 --> 01:58:32.041
[SPEAKER_04]: Battletoads with, like, even more difficulty.

01:58:32.221 --> 01:58:33.882
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it had that, like, level music.

01:58:33.922 --> 01:58:34.002
[SPEAKER_10]: The...

01:58:35.794 --> 01:58:45.261
[SPEAKER_03]: last character idea Clover N this will be the last one I read sorry I didn't get to all of them but lots of responses on Facebook thanks you guys Clover N says Alan Wake could be a character have him go up against Master Chief

01:58:45.717 --> 01:58:46.858
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's... That'll be boring.

01:58:46.878 --> 01:58:50.201
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to flash my flashlight at you.

01:58:50.461 --> 01:58:51.582
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to shoot you in the face.

01:58:53.203 --> 01:58:53.683
[SPEAKER_03]: Done.

01:58:54.064 --> 01:58:54.664
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

01:58:55.204 --> 01:58:59.188
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to give us some tough stuff to talk about, we are going to take phone calls later.

01:58:59.208 --> 01:59:05.032
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have our mailbag, mailbag at orangeonstranger.com and the Twitter, which we'll take Twitter topics later, twitter.com slash OLR.

01:59:05.372 --> 01:59:09.656
[SPEAKER_04]: And Milo would be terrible too because he'd be like, I have family issues and I'm going to shoot you in the face.

01:59:12.043 --> 01:59:15.184
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's get back into some other news, Loki.

01:59:17.284 --> 01:59:17.764
[SPEAKER_11]: Exclusive?

01:59:17.784 --> 01:59:19.124
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm kidding.

01:59:20.324 --> 01:59:24.905
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yes, there's a little bit of talk about the next Smash Bros.

01:59:24.965 --> 01:59:25.225
[SPEAKER_04]: game.

01:59:25.425 --> 01:59:27.126
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we're not talking about PlayStation 1.

01:59:28.586 --> 01:59:30.786
[SPEAKER_04]: For the Wii U and the 3DS.

01:59:31.406 --> 01:59:39.828
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things that they're really pushing for is cross-support for those two platforms to be able to brawl against each other, of course.

01:59:41.768 --> 01:59:49.410
[SPEAKER_04]: It says there's a certain dead end we come to if we just expand the volume of the game.

01:59:50.910 --> 01:59:53.951
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, I intend to change the direction a little bit as we go.

01:59:54.011 --> 02:00:01.173
[SPEAKER_04]: The key is that there's going to be dual support for 3DS and Wii U. So they're going to have some sort of...

02:00:02.557 --> 02:00:27.658
[SPEAKER_04]: you know cross play between the platforms which really in this day and age is not that big a deal I mean the PSP and PlayStation 3 do that the Vita and the PlayStation 3 do that not a huge deal it depends though how like you know well integrated it is too you know well you know with that Wii U controller being the bottom half of a 3DS I'm pretty sure that they'll be able to pull it off

02:00:28.959 --> 02:00:29.419
[SPEAKER_04]: NBA Baller Beats

02:00:53.004 --> 02:00:56.048
[SPEAKER_03]: NBA Baller Beats You play this game with an actual basketball in your living room

02:01:13.986 --> 02:01:22.769
[SPEAKER_03]: and so much more.

02:01:23.569 --> 02:01:30.531
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, USA Today got their hands on the game and say it's a rhythm music game, not like a dribbling coach, but like a rhythm music game.

02:01:30.571 --> 02:01:32.592
[SPEAKER_03]: You bounce the ball to the beat of the music.

02:01:33.072 --> 02:01:58.609
[SPEAKER_03]: you have a visual cue that's a line of basketballs on a musical trail and you have to do specific moves like an icon might prepare you for an upcoming basketball move also in time with the music you might have to cross over from one hand to the other dribble between the legs do a pass fake or a shot fake it's creative I gotta give it that but I'm like how in the fuck is this gonna work because if you're playing it in your living room how do you bounce a ball on your carpet

02:01:59.769 --> 02:02:04.051
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to live in a house with hardwood floors, but even then I don't think my roommate would appreciate me playing this game.

02:02:04.452 --> 02:02:10.975
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, apparently dribbling is going to be very close to the body because that's the way it is in basketball.

02:02:10.995 --> 02:02:13.536
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't encourage you to dribble at the TV or whatever.

02:02:15.817 --> 02:02:16.217
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

02:02:16.437 --> 02:02:21.260
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently it is possible to play baller beats in a carpeted room.

02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:24.982
[SPEAKER_03]: The ball will work on most services.

02:02:26.482 --> 02:02:29.223
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess shag rugs won't work, but the carpet should.

02:02:29.303 --> 02:02:30.904
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the heck to take from that.

02:02:30.924 --> 02:02:32.525
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I should say that's what she said.

02:02:34.766 --> 02:02:35.146
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

02:02:35.206 --> 02:02:36.646
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just like this sounds stupid.

02:02:39.487 --> 02:02:42.449
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give them props to the fact that it's a unique game idea.

02:02:43.069 --> 02:02:44.109
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a little trailer here.

02:02:44.129 --> 02:02:45.230
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to take a look at this.

02:02:45.250 --> 02:02:48.611
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing has been tried like this before, but I think for good reason because it's stupid.

02:02:49.331 --> 02:02:54.575
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think this is going to work well, Kinect.

02:02:54.956 --> 02:02:57.358
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is going to be annoying if you're in a goddamn apartment.

02:02:58.058 --> 02:03:00.000
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially if you're upstairs.

02:03:00.040 --> 02:03:03.262
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, especially if you're upstairs.

02:03:05.164 --> 02:03:09.067
[SPEAKER_03]: I was looking in this trailer for clips of the game, but I don't think I'm going to see it.

02:03:09.407 --> 02:03:10.108
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh wait, no, there's a guy.

02:03:11.208 --> 02:03:13.690
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just him in the living room.

02:03:14.691 --> 02:03:15.372
[SPEAKER_04]: Founcing a ball.

02:03:15.432 --> 02:03:16.812
[SPEAKER_03]: But he doesn't actually shoot the ball.

02:03:16.832 --> 02:03:17.813
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you kind of care.

02:03:17.833 --> 02:03:19.034
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you fake shooting it.

02:03:19.414 --> 02:03:23.777
[SPEAKER_04]: But which icon's going to indicate me throwing the ball into the TV?

02:03:23.837 --> 02:03:27.179
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's kind of a risk.

02:03:27.339 --> 02:03:29.220
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully this thing is made out of Nerf.

02:03:29.280 --> 02:03:32.962
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's the only way you're going to not break your TV.

02:03:34.223 --> 02:03:37.505
[SPEAKER_03]: How many lamps is this game going to take?

02:03:37.605 --> 02:03:39.186
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no in-game footage at all.

02:03:40.387 --> 02:03:40.587
[SPEAKER_03]: None.

02:03:40.647 --> 02:03:41.107
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, whatever.

02:03:44.597 --> 02:03:49.703
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, but these games that come out for Kinect, nobody can fucking take this shit seriously.

02:03:50.024 --> 02:03:54.409
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest, Majesco hasn't really had a lot of games that take the Kinect seriously.

02:03:54.869 --> 02:03:58.934
[SPEAKER_04]: I think their last game that they released for the Kinect was the Twister game.

02:04:00.536 --> 02:04:01.397
[SPEAKER_04]: Twister for Kinect.

02:04:03.079 --> 02:04:03.239
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

02:04:03.960 --> 02:04:04.080
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

02:04:04.321 --> 02:04:04.481
[SPEAKER_04]: Just...

02:04:08.159 --> 02:04:11.001
[SPEAKER_04]: This should be an Xbox Live Arcade game, but it's not.

02:04:12.122 --> 02:04:15.765
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't get a little nerfy ball from Xbox Live Arcade.

02:04:16.206 --> 02:04:17.126
[SPEAKER_03]: Nerfy, derpy, whatever.

02:04:17.207 --> 02:04:23.472
[SPEAKER_03]: This will be on the aisle right next to Babysitting Mama with the little Wii baby that you shoved the Wiimote up its butt.

02:04:23.492 --> 02:04:24.453
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that did well.

02:04:24.773 --> 02:04:26.675
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on sale at Target right now.

02:04:26.695 --> 02:04:27.636
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's incredible.

02:04:28.077 --> 02:04:31.481
[SPEAKER_03]: Porkchop in chat says, My ears are burning at the sound of this asshattery.

02:04:31.501 --> 02:04:34.304
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's pretty much what most people in the chat room boils down to.

02:04:34.764 --> 02:04:40.351
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I got to admit, as dumb as this sounds, you guys, I'm not going to lie.

02:04:40.711 --> 02:04:43.453
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of want to try it, just to say I did.

02:04:44.154 --> 02:04:47.837
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's not like any other Kinect game I've seen yet.

02:04:48.978 --> 02:04:55.743
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess it's kind of a dance game at its core, but if I could do the thing with the ball like that guy, hey, I'd be fly.

02:04:56.804 --> 02:04:57.544
[SPEAKER_03]: I could get chicks.

02:04:59.286 --> 02:05:01.948
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, would I be hot if I could dribble the ball?

02:05:03.109 --> 02:05:05.511
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob, you're becoming whiter.

02:05:09.902 --> 02:05:11.083
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't think it was possible.

02:05:11.103 --> 02:05:11.943
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, knock it off.

02:05:12.003 --> 02:05:13.684
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we're going to go to the mailbag.

02:05:13.784 --> 02:05:15.204
[SPEAKER_03]: Every week you guys send us emails.

02:05:15.865 --> 02:05:16.345
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they don't.

02:05:16.905 --> 02:05:18.585
[SPEAKER_03]: And tell me about the things I shouldn't be doing.

02:05:18.946 --> 02:05:19.526
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they don't.

02:05:20.166 --> 02:05:24.748
[SPEAKER_03]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com They really don't send anything.

02:05:25.388 --> 02:05:26.268
[SPEAKER_10]: We have one email.

02:05:26.628 --> 02:05:27.569
[SPEAKER_03]: One email this week.

02:05:27.849 --> 02:05:32.150
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess everybody just thought with the network switch we wouldn't have time for emails.

02:05:32.410 --> 02:05:33.411
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to hope that was it.

02:05:34.451 --> 02:05:52.587
[SPEAKER_10]: so this comes from Robert M I was wondering whether DarkSakura has had a chance to try the pinball arcade either the iOS version or the latest console download although video pinball simply can't really compete with the experience of real physical tables what her overall impressions were actually I did download it I haven't had a chance to play it yet

02:05:53.038 --> 02:05:55.420
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I talked about this on last week or the week before show.

02:05:55.440 --> 02:05:56.140
[SPEAKER_10]: I have the iOS version.

02:05:56.661 --> 02:05:56.881
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

02:05:57.301 --> 02:06:00.644
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have literally not downloaded it.

02:06:00.684 --> 02:06:00.944
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

02:06:01.004 --> 02:06:01.464
[SPEAKER_03]: I played it on 360.

02:06:01.745 --> 02:06:05.147
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a faithful recreation of the tables.

02:06:05.607 --> 02:06:09.971
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is just like the compilations they already put out.

02:06:10.091 --> 02:06:12.052
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just this is kind of a different way of distributing it.

02:06:12.352 --> 02:06:13.794
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's some different tables too.

02:06:14.234 --> 02:06:17.016
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thrilled to be able to play Theater of Magic.

02:06:17.376 --> 02:06:19.438
[SPEAKER_03]: Theater of Magic is like one of the greatest tables ever.

02:06:19.838 --> 02:06:20.678
[SPEAKER_11]: I could try loading it up.

02:06:20.698 --> 02:06:24.660
[SPEAKER_03]: So to be able to play that and Arabian Nights, is that what the table's actually called?

02:06:25.440 --> 02:06:27.141
[SPEAKER_03]: Or does it have another name to it?

02:06:27.161 --> 02:06:32.443
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I always think of it as... But I love Theater of Magic, so to be able to play that again is great.

02:06:33.704 --> 02:06:37.405
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's things I like about Pinball FX2 and there's things I like about this game.

02:06:37.485 --> 02:06:38.906
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly this game has the...

02:06:39.766 --> 02:06:42.347
[SPEAKER_03]: Classic Table, Black Hole, Theater of Magic, Bride of Pinbot, Medieval Madness

02:07:00.990 --> 02:07:01.170
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

02:07:01.992 --> 02:07:03.154
[SPEAKER_10]: I fucking love Medieval Madness.

02:07:03.174 --> 02:07:05.538
[SPEAKER_03]: There's more games on the iPhone than there are on the Xbox.

02:07:05.818 --> 02:07:07.762
[SPEAKER_03]: Unless it's all DLC I haven't checked out yet.

02:07:07.782 --> 02:07:08.102
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

02:07:08.783 --> 02:07:09.244
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.

02:07:09.545 --> 02:07:09.965
[SPEAKER_10]: Connecting.

02:07:09.985 --> 02:07:12.870
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you like to restore your purchase tables on this device?

02:07:12.890 --> 02:07:14.814
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, so you gotta purchase them on there too, sucker.

02:07:15.635 --> 02:07:15.995
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

02:07:16.916 --> 02:07:18.398
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm buying the hell out of Medieval Madness.

02:07:18.678 --> 02:07:22.862
[SPEAKER_03]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Send us more emails next time.

02:07:23.363 --> 02:07:25.124
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're going to get into... There was more, Rob.

02:07:25.665 --> 02:07:26.045
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sorry.

02:07:26.065 --> 02:07:26.365
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell?

02:07:26.386 --> 02:07:27.106
[SPEAKER_03]: There was more than email.

02:07:27.126 --> 02:07:28.508
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought that was the end of the email.

02:07:28.548 --> 02:07:28.588
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

02:07:28.628 --> 02:07:28.788
[SPEAKER_10]: My bad.

02:07:29.629 --> 02:07:30.850
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what happens when you assume?

02:07:31.611 --> 02:07:33.873
[SPEAKER_10]: You make an ass out of you and not me.

02:07:35.114 --> 02:07:36.916
[SPEAKER_03]: Wouldn't that be asu not me?

02:07:36.936 --> 02:07:39.919
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds Japanese.

02:07:41.857 --> 02:07:42.837
[SPEAKER_03]: It was my golden week tribute.

02:07:42.857 --> 02:07:45.279
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, anyway, whatever.

02:07:46.179 --> 02:07:51.581
[SPEAKER_10]: It says, incidentally, as far as I'm concerned, it would only be ironic if it was raining during the wedding of a local weather reporter.

02:07:52.822 --> 02:07:53.162
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it.

02:07:54.163 --> 02:07:56.884
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm so glad we held up the whole goddamn show to hear that.

02:07:56.904 --> 02:07:57.464
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

02:07:57.524 --> 02:08:03.087
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to read every little word that's on our listeners' email out of respect, Rob.

02:08:03.107 --> 02:08:03.547
[SPEAKER_03]: You're right.

02:08:03.847 --> 02:08:04.847
[SPEAKER_10]: Out of fucking respect.

02:08:04.888 --> 02:08:06.088
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the voice of geeks.

02:08:06.288 --> 02:08:06.868
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking closing this shit.

02:08:06.888 --> 02:08:09.930
[SPEAKER_03]: Even when they're talking about rain on your wedding day.

02:08:10.710 --> 02:08:14.755
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a current song and of course the joke is as current as that.

02:08:14.775 --> 02:08:16.376
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, they play that at work.

02:08:16.496 --> 02:08:17.738
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, done.

02:08:17.898 --> 02:08:19.419
[SPEAKER_03]: It's current at the dentist's office.

02:08:19.499 --> 02:08:21.361
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on.

02:08:21.401 --> 02:08:25.105
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, the dentist's office is the pulse of the entertainment community.

02:08:25.326 --> 02:08:27.488
[SPEAKER_03]: What a perfect time to segue into the FUs of the week.

02:08:44.625 --> 02:08:47.927
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to this thing for not letting me download this.

02:08:48.927 --> 02:08:51.128
[SPEAKER_10]: However, the table pack is like five bucks.

02:08:53.449 --> 02:08:53.809
[SPEAKER_03]: Sucker.

02:08:54.029 --> 02:08:54.409
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

02:08:55.030 --> 02:08:55.350
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki!

02:08:57.051 --> 02:09:00.212
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, F you to the fact that I'm full and there's more breadsticks.

02:09:01.994 --> 02:09:03.555
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to the fact that I'll eat the... No, I'm just kidding.

02:09:03.575 --> 02:09:05.315
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta save room for dinner.

02:09:05.735 --> 02:09:14.118
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I had a really fucking amazing week, so I can't really say F you to the... F you to the fact that I'm moving at work on Thursday.

02:09:14.718 --> 02:09:18.379
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not that I don't care about the whole reorder or whatever.

02:09:18.399 --> 02:09:19.620
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's gonna be interesting.

02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:26.962
[SPEAKER_03]: But the fact that I have to actually physically move, meaning pack up all my shit at my desk into a box...

02:09:27.662 --> 02:09:29.544
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to the fact that I sound really lazy right now.

02:09:50.219 --> 02:09:50.659
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really it.

02:09:50.719 --> 02:09:52.481
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, I had an amazing, amazing week.

02:09:52.541 --> 02:09:54.363
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really can't wait.

02:09:54.983 --> 02:09:57.726
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to talk more about what happened this week on next week's show.

02:09:58.286 --> 02:09:59.487
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I can't talk about it now.

02:09:59.627 --> 02:10:00.468
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll talk about it next week.

02:10:01.149 --> 02:10:01.389
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:10:02.410 --> 02:10:02.850
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on.

02:10:03.611 --> 02:10:04.412
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's get some more news.

02:10:04.472 --> 02:10:04.672
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

02:10:06.155 --> 02:10:08.216
[SPEAKER_04]: So, this is kind of interesting.

02:10:08.236 --> 02:10:12.738
[SPEAKER_04]: It leaked out on the PlayStation Network store.

02:10:13.558 --> 02:10:16.459
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the PlayStation 1 classics for the Vita.

02:10:17.239 --> 02:10:19.760
[SPEAKER_04]: It was actually in the European store.

02:10:20.160 --> 02:10:22.401
[SPEAKER_04]: Buzz Lightyear of Star Command was the game.

02:10:24.202 --> 02:10:26.923
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been pulled so far, but however...

02:10:28.423 --> 02:10:29.463
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't work yet.

02:10:30.244 --> 02:10:32.964
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like it's missing a patch or something like that.

02:10:34.265 --> 02:10:42.467
[SPEAKER_04]: But apparently that is a very good indicator that they're going to be having some PlayStation 1 games available very soon for the PlayStation Vita.

02:10:42.587 --> 02:10:43.087
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank God.

02:10:43.127 --> 02:10:44.007
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope they all are.

02:10:44.047 --> 02:10:47.849
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that would be a great library to just open my Vita to.

02:10:47.909 --> 02:10:49.469
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Final Fantasy VII, hello.

02:10:50.629 --> 02:10:51.130
[SPEAKER_03]: What else do I own?

02:10:51.150 --> 02:10:51.570
[SPEAKER_03]: Castlevania.

02:10:51.590 --> 02:10:53.310
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you're getting some of these through PS Plus too.

02:10:53.410 --> 02:10:56.051
[SPEAKER_03]: Silent Hill, the original, is free right now on PlayStation Plus.

02:10:56.531 --> 02:11:24.411
[SPEAKER_03]: hopefully the plus stuff works on the Vita maybe they have to get all that worked out I don't know but yeah I'm looking forward to that that's gonna I know it sounds really weird that like you know it's like oh I'm excited about old ass 15 year old games on my portable console but you know I don't know I just there's a lot of stuff I have now that I didn't when my PSP was all the rage and those screens are so big and crystal clear like I'm it's most likely something they'll announce at E3 yeah

02:11:25.615 --> 02:11:26.835
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I gotta wait that long.

02:11:28.056 --> 02:11:36.157
[SPEAKER_03]: I will only accept that if it's one of those, well, we're gonna be patching the PlayStation 1 titles into the Vita today.

02:11:36.477 --> 02:11:39.218
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how sometimes there's that whole today announcement.

02:11:39.578 --> 02:11:41.218
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what did Microsoft have?

02:11:41.618 --> 02:11:44.239
[SPEAKER_03]: Googly eyes on the Kinect today.

02:11:44.959 --> 02:11:46.579
[SPEAKER_03]: Kinect Labs, that was it.

02:11:46.839 --> 02:11:47.900
[SPEAKER_03]: Googly eyes.

02:11:48.320 --> 02:11:49.180
[SPEAKER_03]: Laser pointer.

02:11:51.129 --> 02:12:19.857
[SPEAKER_04]: you know I liked it better some of that stuff was cute no no I liked it better was that the second year we went to E3 2006 and they fucking had hey listen you know what I know a lot of you people can't go to E3 so we're gonna put some of those demos that are at E3 on your console that was fucking great that was great but they don't do that shit anymore they never do that anymore it was like Lost Planet and I'd play the shit out of that demo over and over again and MotoGP but I didn't give a shit about that

02:12:20.257 --> 02:12:24.520
[SPEAKER_04]: But at least Capcom got it for once, you know, there.

02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:26.281
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they should really do that again.

02:12:26.341 --> 02:12:29.763
[SPEAKER_03]: Or as Orange, right, in the chat room says, Saturn is coming out today.

02:12:30.524 --> 02:12:31.804
[SPEAKER_03]: Things were different back then, though.

02:12:31.844 --> 02:12:34.646
[SPEAKER_03]: When the Saturn came out, technology wasn't the way it is now.

02:12:35.026 --> 02:12:38.529
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I think if they were to do a system launch like that, it would be a lot different.

02:12:39.309 --> 02:12:44.052
[SPEAKER_03]: Or at least, like, you know, maybe not today, but, like, it's coming out next Friday.

02:12:44.372 --> 02:12:46.894
[SPEAKER_03]: Apple does that.

02:12:47.814 --> 02:12:48.335
[SPEAKER_03]: Works for them.

02:12:49.315 --> 02:12:49.876
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anyhow.

02:12:50.736 --> 02:12:52.978
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you just talked about one thing Capcom does right.

02:12:52.998 --> 02:12:54.820
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me tell you about something Capcom does very wrong.

02:12:54.840 --> 02:12:57.182
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's a long list.

02:12:57.202 --> 02:12:58.803
[SPEAKER_03]: The Mega Man franchise.

02:13:00.044 --> 02:13:10.734
[SPEAKER_03]: It is of note, and I wanted to bring it up here on the show, that the 100,000 strong for bringing back Mega Man Legends 3 actually hit 100,000 members this week.

02:13:10.794 --> 02:13:11.774
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm one of them.

02:13:12.095 --> 02:13:12.215
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

02:13:12.675 --> 02:13:15.057
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I am too, so there you go.

02:13:15.298 --> 02:13:18.360
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is something that the million moms couldn't accomplish.

02:13:18.461 --> 02:13:23.725
[SPEAKER_03]: The one million moms against Ellen or whatever dumbass hattery that stuff was.

02:13:24.526 --> 02:13:27.269
[SPEAKER_03]: So the 100,000 strong for Mega Man Legends.

02:13:27.329 --> 02:13:29.771
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked, they set a reasonable goal.

02:13:29.871 --> 02:13:32.974
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't say millions for Mega Man Legends.

02:13:33.374 --> 02:13:36.217
[SPEAKER_03]: They said 100,000 strong for Mega Man Legends.

02:13:36.377 --> 02:13:36.818
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

02:13:48.810 --> 02:13:49.710
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

02:13:50.050 --> 02:13:50.391
[SPEAKER_03]: 100,000 strong.

02:13:50.411 --> 02:14:01.974
[SPEAKER_04]: It's important that if you are a member of the group and you have not joined the dev room community as part of Capcom, make sure you do that because that's what Capcom is actually looking at, assuming that they're actually looking at something.

02:14:02.834 --> 02:14:06.215
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe this is going to pressure Capcom into an announcement this E3.

02:14:06.255 --> 02:14:06.655
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

02:14:08.075 --> 02:14:35.412
[SPEAKER_03]: well you fans you demanded it so we're gonna finally port those games over that we've been promising oh I'm sorry that's into Ranma in our chat room says Sky I know people on that group they fucking occupied the Capcom booth at Comic Con as hilarious as that imagery is that's kind of messed up because the people at the booths manning the floor especially at an event like Comic Con probably aren't really the decision makers yeah but the word will get back

02:14:35.892 --> 02:14:43.805
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess that's true, but I don't know if that's exactly the best way to go about doing it, to make a scene like that, but whatever, different strokes for different folks.

02:14:46.929 --> 02:14:47.530
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

02:15:06.264 --> 02:15:07.885
[SPEAKER_03]: Yet, it worked.

02:15:08.405 --> 02:15:09.825
[SPEAKER_03]: We're having to eat our words a little bit.

02:15:09.865 --> 02:15:14.667
[SPEAKER_04]: It worked, or GameStop decided, hey, we're in a backlog, we need to bring it over here, and then another publisher took over the last story.

02:15:14.687 --> 02:15:16.487
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say it worked for the last story.

02:15:17.427 --> 02:15:19.708
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the last story was a different publisher, and Nintendo didn't have anything.

02:15:19.828 --> 02:15:20.688
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, but it still worked.

02:15:21.028 --> 02:15:24.770
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody noticed, and somebody put it out, and somebody took the risk that Nintendo wouldn't take.

02:15:24.850 --> 02:15:27.170
[SPEAKER_04]: And no one fucking recognized President Cat.

02:15:27.370 --> 02:15:31.432
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, seriously, President Cat, there was a big campaign behind it for a few weeks, and then...

02:15:33.292 --> 02:15:51.970
[SPEAKER_03]: well I'm maybe President Cat will be a Wii U launch title perhaps we need a hundred thousand strong for President Cat I think we had a good 50 on Twitter 50 period all right and that's how many copies of the game sold in Japan too apparently all right DarkSakura another story please

02:15:52.711 --> 02:15:55.113
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there was a leak.

02:15:55.593 --> 02:16:12.447
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I know everything I've talked about so far has been leaks, but there was video footage out for Rayman Legends that was the Wii U version, and it showed how its graphical power, the touchscreen tablet, the near-field communication...

02:16:13.107 --> 02:16:36.724
[SPEAKER_10]: basically it had everything on there and then we had a statement put out by Ubisoft that said yeah this is real and they're working on it at the Montpellier is that how it's pronounced studios right now and basically they said that yeah it's not the final game don't use that as representative but in fact here's actually what they're the actual statement is I'll just read it

02:16:37.404 --> 02:16:38.064
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

02:16:55.234 --> 02:17:19.627
[SPEAKER_10]: Who often create game prototypes with work-in-progress development kits Ubisoft confirms the development of Rayman Legends Handled by, I guess that's Michel Ancel And his team in Montpellier So, that's it Well, sucks for them that that got out But these things tend to happen I don't know why you would create a sizzle reel For a different department in your company

02:17:20.444 --> 02:17:20.564
[SPEAKER_03]: Demo

02:17:35.951 --> 02:17:51.429
[SPEAKER_03]: I have heard from people that I know that work in development and so forth that they do sometimes these you know because when you have these offices all over the place all over the world you do sometimes have these powwows be it virtually or whatever where folks are kind of like this is what we're working on this is what we're working on

02:17:52.409 --> 02:17:53.430
[SPEAKER_03]: Any industry does this.

02:17:53.490 --> 02:17:55.751
[SPEAKER_03]: In my job, it's called best practices.

02:17:55.811 --> 02:17:58.953
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a trainer, and my training department gets together with other training departments.

02:17:58.973 --> 02:18:01.434
[SPEAKER_03]: We talk about what are we doing right now?

02:18:01.474 --> 02:18:02.594
[SPEAKER_03]: What can we learn from you guys?

02:18:03.275 --> 02:18:04.215
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we do.

02:18:04.295 --> 02:18:05.956
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, any big company does something like that.

02:18:06.016 --> 02:18:06.716
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a secret.

02:18:07.497 --> 02:18:08.957
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think this is just a part of that.

02:18:11.259 --> 02:18:14.940
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they're going to get with other departments about not leaking your stuff.

02:18:14.980 --> 02:18:15.160
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

02:18:15.621 --> 02:18:18.182
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that's the meeting that has to be held next.

02:18:20.126 --> 02:18:25.214
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyways, as I was alluding to earlier in the show, this is what's wrong with the goddamn industry right there.

02:18:25.995 --> 02:18:31.845
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm assuming that most people have seen the video, and they're talking about...

02:18:33.962 --> 02:18:35.983
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wii U integration and stuff like that, which is cool.

02:18:36.263 --> 02:18:42.285
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the whole like, oh, one person's on the Wii U tablet and they're, you know, moving the platforms or whatever.

02:18:42.305 --> 02:18:46.067
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like how they do it in LittleBigPlanet with like the move support and the like original thing.

02:18:47.187 --> 02:18:54.570
[SPEAKER_04]: Although the near field communication stuff scares me because that shit Skylanders all over fucking again.

02:18:54.590 --> 02:18:56.831
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's like, oh, hey, you want Rabbids World?

02:18:57.151 --> 02:18:59.552
[SPEAKER_04]: Place the Rabbids statue on the tablet.

02:18:59.932 --> 02:19:01.073
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you want to play it with Enzo?

02:19:01.573 --> 02:19:03.234
[SPEAKER_04]: Place the ends of the statue on the tablet.

02:19:03.374 --> 02:19:04.295
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you want hearts in the game?

02:19:04.335 --> 02:19:05.836
[SPEAKER_04]: Place the heart statue on the tablet.

02:19:05.856 --> 02:19:13.362
[SPEAKER_04]: Just deposit 25 cents into your Wii U. It's physical DLC is what that shit is, and people are fucking stupid and will buy this shit.

02:19:13.723 --> 02:19:15.544
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a statue of a rabbit!

02:19:16.104 --> 02:19:23.570
[SPEAKER_04]: And you've suckered somebody into purchasing a piece of DLC that would have been $2 normally, but it's a fucking cheap-ass statue that you're going to pay $8 for.

02:19:24.821 --> 02:19:32.351
[SPEAKER_03]: Not gonna lie though, if I could like get a Kaden statue that would unlock an all Kaden level in Mass Effect, I would be all over that.

02:19:33.112 --> 02:19:35.475
[SPEAKER_03]: I would bow down to that statue.

02:19:35.495 --> 02:19:36.757
[SPEAKER_05]: I love you Kaden.

02:19:37.398 --> 02:19:38.419
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying it's...

02:19:40.161 --> 02:19:43.842
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo's tried this with fucking AR cards with Kid Icarus.

02:19:44.362 --> 02:19:48.664
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just experimenting with this because they saw how successful Skylanders was.

02:19:49.104 --> 02:19:51.604
[SPEAKER_04]: Skylanders was a franchise that doesn't really exist.

02:19:51.724 --> 02:19:55.906
[SPEAKER_04]: It has Spyro in it, but fuck, it's not really Spyro anymore.

02:19:56.426 --> 02:20:00.607
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not really a Spyro franchise, but it's a brand new franchise with no backing.

02:20:01.287 --> 02:20:03.968
[SPEAKER_04]: They sold toys and people were like, oh my god, I need

02:20:04.008 --> 02:20:05.329
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:20:26.354 --> 02:20:29.035
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I need all the Pokemon statues so I can unlock them in-game.

02:20:29.615 --> 02:20:30.276
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you imagine?

02:20:30.296 --> 02:20:33.197
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you're probably thinking, oh, that's ridiculous.

02:20:33.357 --> 02:20:33.837
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not.

02:20:33.997 --> 02:20:36.958
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fucking in a couple years' time is what's going to happen.

02:20:39.159 --> 02:20:40.780
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's going to get fucking ridiculous.

02:20:42.181 --> 02:20:45.462
[SPEAKER_03]: RawSteelUT in the VOG Network chatroom says, Calm down, Loki.

02:20:45.522 --> 02:20:46.943
[SPEAKER_03]: There are going to be cash-ins for this.

02:20:47.283 --> 02:20:49.184
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to see this take off long-term.

02:20:49.644 --> 02:20:52.425
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft says Nintendo already did this with the e-reader.

02:20:55.017 --> 02:21:22.841
[SPEAKER_04]: but I don't think the e-reader necessarily took off it was a neat idea and I think it was a great idea with some of like the stuff they did for Animal Crossing and stuff but I mean that was a little different unlocking the Legend of Zelda or Super Mario Brothers in a game is pretty cool compared to like you know and how much were those cards they weren't that expensive man the old school Animal Crossing on the GameCube did it the best with the whole like old games oh man that's such a deal that Nintendo wants you to forget ever happened

02:21:24.474 --> 02:21:24.774
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:21:25.214 --> 02:21:29.817
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got to share this funny comment from Shane because I was talking about the Caden statues.

02:21:29.857 --> 02:21:33.079
[SPEAKER_03]: So Shane's in our chat room at thevognetwork.com.

02:21:34.220 --> 02:21:35.620
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me, vognetwork.com.

02:21:35.680 --> 02:21:36.941
[SPEAKER_03]: I almost said the old chat room.

02:21:38.022 --> 02:21:41.384
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody in chat's waiting for one of us to fuck up tonight and say something old.

02:21:42.484 --> 02:21:48.388
[SPEAKER_03]: Shane says, I would buy all those statues, talking about the Caden statues, all up before you could even see one, Rob.

02:21:48.988 --> 02:21:50.469
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I tell you a funny story about Shane?

02:21:52.362 --> 02:21:52.803
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Rob.

02:21:52.883 --> 02:21:55.446
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking in the car while I was on my way.

02:21:56.046 --> 02:21:59.410
[SPEAKER_03]: This week, I drove to LA at midnight.

02:21:59.771 --> 02:22:02.113
[SPEAKER_03]: I drove to LA from midnight to 5 a.m.

02:22:02.734 --> 02:22:07.740
[SPEAKER_03]: I had Victoria with me, but I had to drive to the Stockton area to pick Victoria up from Sacramento.

02:22:07.760 --> 02:22:10.803
[SPEAKER_03]: She lives in a town called Livermore, for those of you guys familiar with California.

02:22:10.823 --> 02:22:12.365
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's about an hour and a half away from where I'm at.

02:22:12.745 --> 02:22:15.546
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm driving down there about 10 o'clock at night, and I call Shane on the road.

02:22:15.606 --> 02:22:16.986
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, Shane, entertain me.

02:22:17.466 --> 02:22:19.667
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's talking about, I'm trying to pick out a new gamer tag.

02:22:19.767 --> 02:22:23.768
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can't think of what gamer tag to pick out, because I want a new gamer tag.

02:22:23.788 --> 02:22:25.249
[SPEAKER_03]: And I asked him if I could share this with you guys.

02:22:26.269 --> 02:22:30.770
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, well, Shane, you need to just put something you really love in your gamer tag.

02:22:30.810 --> 02:22:33.371
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, I can't get Caden.

02:22:33.731 --> 02:22:35.132
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything Caden has taken.

02:22:35.192 --> 02:22:38.853
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, why don't you make your gamer tag Shane Alenko?

02:22:38.873 --> 02:22:39.593
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

02:22:40.293 --> 02:22:41.574
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what would have been good?

02:22:41.594 --> 02:22:41.694
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

02:22:41.714 --> 02:22:42.095
[SPEAKER_03]: Cadence.

02:22:42.115 --> 02:22:43.015
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that doesn't work.

02:22:58.681 --> 02:22:59.342
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anyhow.

02:23:00.403 --> 02:23:00.803
[SPEAKER_03]: There it is.

02:23:01.143 --> 02:23:02.404
[SPEAKER_03]: That was your random tangent story.

02:23:02.725 --> 02:23:03.946
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, two more stories.

02:23:03.966 --> 02:23:06.508
[SPEAKER_10]: Which is a lot more interesting than your grocery store tangent.

02:23:06.568 --> 02:23:07.089
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

02:23:07.189 --> 02:23:07.509
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

02:23:07.549 --> 02:23:07.889
[SPEAKER_03]: Shut up.

02:23:08.290 --> 02:23:10.412
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, two more stories, and then Twitter and Skype.

02:23:11.312 --> 02:23:14.275
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this is an unusual chain of events.

02:23:15.196 --> 02:23:18.559
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, Nexen is looking to take over EA.

02:23:19.500 --> 02:23:21.922
[SPEAKER_04]: They're actually bidding to buy EA.

02:23:21.942 --> 02:23:22.162
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

02:23:23.663 --> 02:23:29.107
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, they're really big in South Korea, and they have a lot of money.

02:23:29.628 --> 02:23:37.233
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that they're actually going to take them over, but it's interesting that they're trying.

02:23:38.594 --> 02:23:47.921
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of funny that somebody's trying to take on EA, but everybody's laughing, kind of pointing and laughing, going, how cute, and you're just waiting for it to flip the other way.

02:23:48.681 --> 02:23:50.542
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't we buy you, Nexon?

02:23:50.562 --> 02:23:52.524
[SPEAKER_04]: There's always a bigger fish.

02:23:55.390 --> 02:23:57.352
[SPEAKER_03]: Who do you think could buy EA, if anyone?

02:23:58.072 --> 02:23:58.853
[SPEAKER_03]: Microsoft?

02:23:59.633 --> 02:24:00.094
[SPEAKER_03]: Sony?

02:24:01.395 --> 02:24:03.637
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, who's bigger than EA at this point in the gaming world?

02:24:03.657 --> 02:24:04.638
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would they want to?

02:24:04.698 --> 02:24:06.519
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a Viacom or something like that?

02:24:06.619 --> 02:24:10.622
[SPEAKER_03]: To stop EA from all this multi-platform online stuff they're trying to do?

02:24:11.343 --> 02:24:14.766
[SPEAKER_03]: And lock EA and all their games into one particular system?

02:24:14.926 --> 02:24:16.547
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you imagine if Microsoft did that?

02:24:16.667 --> 02:24:17.028
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

02:24:18.128 --> 02:24:19.970
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, sports games, we have them.

02:24:20.130 --> 02:24:20.691
[SPEAKER_03]: No one else does.

02:24:20.711 --> 02:24:26.416
[SPEAKER_03]: If Facebook is going to pay $1 billion for Instagram, surely there's a way.

02:24:26.516 --> 02:24:37.686
[SPEAKER_03]: If Microsoft wants it bad enough, they could snap up EA and every EA exclusive is now a Microsoft exclusive, including the sports franchises, Mass Effect, Dragon Age.

02:24:37.766 --> 02:24:39.727
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm thinking of all the Bioware stuff because that's the stuff I like.

02:24:39.747 --> 02:24:40.368
[SPEAKER_03]: Battlefield.

02:24:40.388 --> 02:24:41.028
[SPEAKER_03]: Battlefield.

02:24:43.010 --> 02:24:47.614
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, but because of that, EA probably just cost too damn much.

02:24:48.815 --> 02:24:51.758
[SPEAKER_03]: Team Ron in our chatroom says, Ted Turner should buy EA.

02:24:53.219 --> 02:24:53.880
[SPEAKER_03]: Ted Turner!

02:24:54.440 --> 02:24:56.122
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, they tried to do gaming.

02:24:56.222 --> 02:24:57.944
[SPEAKER_03]: Turner was GameTap.

02:24:58.804 --> 02:25:02.587
[SPEAKER_03]: The Turner Network stuff started GameTap back in the day, back when GameTap was alright.

02:25:03.027 --> 02:25:04.688
[SPEAKER_03]: GameTap was really interesting when it first came out.

02:25:04.708 --> 02:25:06.589
[SPEAKER_03]: I still think they could come back if they really wanted to.

02:25:06.609 --> 02:25:08.430
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it kind of went to crap since the beginning.

02:25:09.030 --> 02:25:10.211
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it just blends in with the rest.

02:25:10.231 --> 02:25:16.415
[SPEAKER_03]: When it had its own player, and they were talking about the desktop stuff and all that, and it had its own launcher, it was really neat looking.

02:25:16.875 --> 02:25:22.979
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it just looks like any other... It blends right in with everything else, like what GameFly is doing and all that other stuff.

02:25:24.600 --> 02:25:24.740
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

02:25:25.313 --> 02:25:28.614
[SPEAKER_03]: and plus for a while GameTap was like the only place you could play Myst Online.

02:25:29.174 --> 02:25:29.934
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of that other stuff.

02:25:29.974 --> 02:25:31.234
[SPEAKER_04]: They should come out with a console.

02:25:31.274 --> 02:25:33.075
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be a PC from like 10 years ago.

02:25:33.195 --> 02:25:34.695
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll play all the old stuff.

02:25:35.275 --> 02:25:35.815
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

02:25:35.936 --> 02:25:36.476
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knows?

02:25:36.496 --> 02:25:39.316
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, what are we going to do with these old PCs?

02:25:39.476 --> 02:25:40.577
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got an idea.

02:25:40.777 --> 02:25:43.437
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you see that happen with the NES stuff?

02:25:43.977 --> 02:25:49.439
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you see those 101 built into the NES?

02:25:49.659 --> 02:25:52.960
[SPEAKER_03]: Because all the patents on the old NES stuff have expired.

02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:54.020
[SPEAKER_03]: The actual hardware.

02:25:54.140 --> 02:25:54.940
[SPEAKER_04]: Pirates don't give a fuck.

02:25:55.720 --> 02:25:56.301
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

02:25:57.161 --> 02:25:59.342
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and Nintendo doesn't really protect it very well either.

02:25:59.702 --> 02:26:08.627
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if they can't or what the deal is, but... Let's see, DJ Dark Knight in our chatroom says, Totally forgot about GameTap, lol.

02:26:09.007 --> 02:26:11.368
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's GameTap's problem.

02:26:11.629 --> 02:26:13.409
[SPEAKER_03]: They used to have really funny commercials.

02:26:13.830 --> 02:26:16.711
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason why was because they had Turner Network behind them.

02:26:16.751 --> 02:26:20.053
[SPEAKER_03]: So they had the ability to do some fun TV stuff.

02:26:21.454 --> 02:26:22.975
[SPEAKER_03]: Seg in our chat room.

02:26:23.015 --> 02:26:23.355
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi Seg.

02:26:23.655 --> 02:26:27.678
[SPEAKER_03]: Says, yep, GameTap resurrected Myst Online or Uru was the name of that.

02:26:27.798 --> 02:26:29.979
[SPEAKER_03]: I did, Myst Online was creepy.

02:26:30.479 --> 02:26:32.000
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of a creepy game to me.

02:26:32.521 --> 02:26:35.763
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way, since Seg's in chat, I should say, everybody check out Walking Dead.

02:26:36.363 --> 02:26:36.843
[SPEAKER_03]: Just came out.

02:26:37.984 --> 02:26:39.665
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Seg would appreciate me throwing that out there.

02:26:41.026 --> 02:26:41.326
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:26:41.786 --> 02:26:42.647
[SPEAKER_03]: One more story for you guys.

02:26:43.047 --> 02:26:49.151
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:26:50.748 --> 02:26:55.612
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:27:14.537 --> 02:27:15.458
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, somebody does.

02:27:16.599 --> 02:27:20.942
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I think it was a pretty big game in the 80s, but because it never had a home port, I think a lot of people forgot it.

02:27:21.362 --> 02:27:35.012
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what's interesting, Howard Scott Warshaw, who made Yars' Revenge, E.T., love him or hate him, he made some great games and some bad games on the Atari 2600, he said StarCastle could never be stuffed into a game cartridge.

02:27:35.312 --> 02:27:39.075
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why they never did it, because there was no way they could have done it in 8K.

02:27:39.495 --> 02:27:40.556
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Scott Williamson...

02:27:40.896 --> 02:28:08.034
[SPEAKER_03]: who was one of these guys back in the day that was doing stuff for the 2600 he never believed it so here we are 30 years later I love this this is like something Loki would do don't you ever tell me I can't do something because damn it someday I'm gonna fucking do it and here we are 30 years later and Scott Williamson achieved it he got Starcastle down into a format for the Atari 2600

02:28:09.275 --> 02:28:12.678
[SPEAKER_03]: He is now the technical director at Development Studio High Voltage.

02:28:13.339 --> 02:28:19.204
[SPEAKER_03]: What I think is really cool though, they made this custom cartridge and I actually really love this.

02:28:19.244 --> 02:28:20.766
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a great YouTube where you can check this out.

02:28:21.206 --> 02:28:23.828
[SPEAKER_03]: The freaking cartridge lights up.

02:28:24.349 --> 02:28:33.437
[SPEAKER_03]: They built these little lights into the cartridge so that as you're playing it, I'm trying to get to like a part where you see it in the video here because I don't want to play the whole like two and a half minute video.

02:28:34.198 --> 02:28:34.779
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty cool.

02:28:35.459 --> 02:28:55.021
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah oh yeah the game looks great but there's a part in it where you actually see the little cartridge is like lighting up with the game it's technology like at the time oh my god can you imagine if somebody had done this when Atari 2600 was like new yeah oh oh there it is here look at this part here in the video see like it's lighting up with the game

02:28:56.522 --> 02:28:57.762
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can actually buy that cartridge.

02:28:57.942 --> 02:28:58.483
[SPEAKER_03]: You can.

02:28:59.003 --> 02:29:04.066
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to get a copy of the cartridge, you know they're trying to fund an effort right now to get that cartridge made.

02:29:04.086 --> 02:29:05.687
[SPEAKER_03]: They want to make a lot of these and sell these.

02:29:06.107 --> 02:29:10.189
[SPEAKER_03]: So where does everybody go when they need money fast in this day and age?

02:29:10.250 --> 02:29:10.970
[SPEAKER_03]: Kickfarter.

02:29:11.070 --> 02:29:11.910
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

02:29:12.031 --> 02:29:13.191
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a kickfarter.

02:29:13.651 --> 02:29:18.934
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you go to Kickstarter, it's the Atari 2600 Star Castle.

02:29:18.995 --> 02:29:19.915
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta say, this one's...

02:29:22.248 --> 02:29:23.269
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:29:50.709 --> 02:29:52.970
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for the fact that I'd be buying the actual cartridge.

02:29:53.090 --> 02:29:55.732
[SPEAKER_11]: I am forever more than going to refer to those things as kickfarters.

02:29:56.292 --> 02:29:57.353
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's a great name for it.

02:29:57.373 --> 02:29:58.393
[SPEAKER_11]: I am so against them.

02:29:59.534 --> 02:30:01.175
[SPEAKER_11]: Except if they give me money.

02:30:01.715 --> 02:30:02.395
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, man.

02:30:02.996 --> 02:30:05.717
[SPEAKER_04]: I've contributed to two, and both are pretty good.

02:30:06.117 --> 02:30:08.039
[SPEAKER_04]: Video Game High School and Shadowrun.

02:30:09.399 --> 02:30:10.880
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I like me some Shadowrun.

02:30:10.920 --> 02:30:12.321
[SPEAKER_04]: And Freddy Wong, man.

02:30:12.961 --> 02:30:15.082
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever he makes and wants money for, I'll pay for it.

02:30:18.074 --> 02:30:21.618
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I think that's about the time where we're going to open up the Skype line.

02:30:22.039 --> 02:30:22.980
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, I have Skype open.

02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:24.162
[SPEAKER_03]: I just had it on DND.

02:30:24.883 --> 02:30:26.304
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me unlock that there.

02:30:26.444 --> 02:30:28.367
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to cast Magic Missile.

02:30:29.508 --> 02:30:30.049
[SPEAKER_03]: It's open.

02:30:30.169 --> 02:30:31.230
[SPEAKER_08]: It's on DND, right?

02:30:32.252 --> 02:30:33.073
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not disturb.

02:30:33.093 --> 02:30:33.834
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a little disturbing.

02:30:36.724 --> 02:30:38.065
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you have a last-minute story for us.

02:30:38.125 --> 02:30:39.185
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have a last-minute story.

02:30:39.265 --> 02:30:39.946
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, go for it.

02:30:40.026 --> 02:30:41.467
[SPEAKER_10]: I was interested in Awesomenauts.

02:30:42.307 --> 02:30:50.212
[SPEAKER_10]: It turns out that their publisher, DTP Entertainment, filed for, as they say overseas, insolvency, which is pretty much the equivalent of bankruptcy.

02:30:50.732 --> 02:30:54.094
[SPEAKER_10]: So it may not make the May 2nd release date.

02:30:56.195 --> 02:31:01.438
[SPEAKER_10]: But Romano Games, which is the developer, is really trying to work on getting it out, so...

02:31:02.648 --> 02:31:04.930
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm looking at our chatroom at chat.orange.com.

02:31:05.150 --> 02:31:10.854
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed Seg is suddenly getting an impromptu interview in the chatroom because people were like, Seg, did you work on Walking Dead?

02:31:10.914 --> 02:31:12.416
[SPEAKER_03]: That was awesome.

02:31:12.956 --> 02:31:17.480
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not played it myself yet because I haven't watched the show, although I understand the game is based off the books.

02:31:17.860 --> 02:31:20.882
[SPEAKER_03]: I do still want to check it out because I hear it's really good.

02:31:21.082 --> 02:31:22.143
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's really loving the game.

02:31:22.183 --> 02:31:23.804
[SPEAKER_03]: So Seg is giving an impromptu interview at...

02:31:24.765 --> 02:31:26.166
[SPEAKER_03]: VOG Network dot com.

02:31:27.347 --> 02:31:29.729
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to mention what Blackwell says in the chat room.

02:31:30.109 --> 02:31:33.872
[SPEAKER_03]: Fifty dollars is about how much you'd be paying for a custom 2600 cartridge anyway.

02:31:33.932 --> 02:31:34.933
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a decent price.

02:31:35.353 --> 02:31:37.314
[SPEAKER_03]: I paid 40 bucks for Halo 2600.

02:31:37.735 --> 02:31:39.136
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody actually did Halo 2600.

02:31:40.036 --> 02:31:40.297
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:31:41.037 --> 02:31:42.138
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to the phones.

02:31:42.258 --> 02:31:44.079
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

02:31:44.099 --> 02:31:44.400
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

02:31:45.248 --> 02:31:46.711
[SPEAKER_03]: Shane, Shane Alenko

02:31:58.562 --> 02:32:04.809
[SPEAKER_07]: No, actually, I was thinking about stuff, and so I decided to call on said stuff.

02:32:04.949 --> 02:32:12.417
[SPEAKER_03]: You can hear more about the WoW beta on Best Little Horde House in Azeroth at www.hordehouse.com.

02:32:12.737 --> 02:32:17.102
[SPEAKER_03]: We have nothing to say about Horde House and VOG yet, but we'll see.

02:32:17.262 --> 02:32:18.884
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, Shane, what did you really want to call in about?

02:32:20.231 --> 02:32:28.278
[SPEAKER_07]: I was thinking about those rumors of the Midnight Purple 3DS since it's popping up all over the place on online sites.

02:32:28.618 --> 02:32:29.259
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a rumor.

02:32:29.279 --> 02:32:30.219
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a rumor.

02:32:30.239 --> 02:32:31.180
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a picture of it.

02:32:31.480 --> 02:32:35.104
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, because it was at E3 as one of the concept colors a long time ago.

02:32:35.604 --> 02:32:38.727
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it might not be that specific color.

02:32:39.207 --> 02:32:40.589
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be slightly changed.

02:32:41.109 --> 02:32:41.429
[SPEAKER_03]: If that...

02:32:42.390 --> 02:32:55.577
[SPEAKER_03]: If that color comes out, that will be the first time I will ever, as I call it, quote, pull a Shane and buy a $250 system just because it's in a nice new color.

02:32:57.318 --> 02:33:01.040
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to upgrade if that's the case because I can't tell the difference between blue and purple.

02:33:01.100 --> 02:33:03.362
[SPEAKER_07]: So to me, it's a new blue system for me.

02:33:05.303 --> 02:33:06.503
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really happy with that.

02:33:06.543 --> 02:33:07.624
[SPEAKER_07]: But wouldn't that...

02:33:08.288 --> 02:33:14.701
[SPEAKER_07]: Make it all the less likely they would announce a redesign at E3 for the 3DS?

02:33:14.901 --> 02:33:15.021
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

02:33:15.675 --> 02:33:21.681
[SPEAKER_03]: No, because they were still releasing, even after the DSi XL came out, they released the DSi in pretty pink and all this stuff.

02:33:22.061 --> 02:33:23.342
[SPEAKER_03]: So not necessarily.

02:33:23.983 --> 02:33:26.285
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, it may still be too soon.

02:33:26.365 --> 02:33:29.108
[SPEAKER_03]: This year still may be too soon for the redesign.

02:33:29.528 --> 02:33:31.130
[SPEAKER_03]: The 3DS is only a year old.

02:33:31.310 --> 02:33:33.352
[SPEAKER_03]: I see this as the kind of thing that's in a two-year cycle.

02:33:33.392 --> 02:33:39.738
[SPEAKER_04]: And also because they're trying to make sure that they're not losing more money on there, adding more components to a system might not be a good idea.

02:33:39.918 --> 02:33:44.883
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this year is about the Wii U. I mean, certainly they still want people to buy the 3DS.

02:33:45.284 --> 02:33:48.407
[SPEAKER_04]: They could do a 3DS XL with the extra add-on built in.

02:33:48.527 --> 02:33:52.772
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't think they would do a 3DS XL or whatever and the Wii U in the same year.

02:33:53.332 --> 02:33:57.096
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this year will be the Wii U. Next year will be their 3DS redesign.

02:33:57.437 --> 02:34:01.020
[SPEAKER_03]: Year after that, some huge add-on for the Wii U or something.

02:34:01.764 --> 02:34:03.185
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, then what about this?

02:34:03.646 --> 02:34:07.689
[SPEAKER_07]: What game are they going to launch that makes that color make sense?

02:34:08.289 --> 02:34:08.910
[SPEAKER_07]: What, purple?

02:34:09.530 --> 02:34:14.254
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, because they tend to launch games that kind of fit with the new color schemes.

02:34:14.294 --> 02:34:19.078
[SPEAKER_07]: Like they had in Japan, they had the Fire Emblem Blue.

02:34:19.298 --> 02:34:22.120
[SPEAKER_07]: They've had stuff similar to that.

02:34:22.180 --> 02:34:22.561
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

02:34:22.601 --> 02:34:23.121
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't think.

02:34:23.141 --> 02:34:24.422
[SPEAKER_04]: Pokemon Purple.

02:34:24.582 --> 02:34:24.863
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

02:34:25.523 --> 02:34:28.265
[SPEAKER_04]: Luigi's Mansion 2 or Animal Crossing.

02:34:29.386 --> 02:34:32.928
[SPEAKER_03]: Waluigi takes over the world because he was purple, right?

02:34:33.748 --> 02:34:36.370
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, maybe he's in crappy Luigi's Mansion 2.

02:34:36.690 --> 02:34:39.131
[SPEAKER_07]: That hopefully is better than that E3 demo I played.

02:34:39.171 --> 02:34:39.772
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.

02:34:41.192 --> 02:34:42.913
[SPEAKER_03]: Or what else is purple?

02:34:44.334 --> 02:34:44.874
[SPEAKER_03]: Barney.

02:34:45.115 --> 02:34:46.375
[SPEAKER_03]: Barney the dinosaur.

02:34:48.016 --> 02:34:48.877
[SPEAKER_03]: He's coming back.

02:34:49.397 --> 02:34:53.400
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe the license on Barney now that it's been 20 years is so cheap.

02:34:53.440 --> 02:34:56.523
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe somebody else has licensed him and now we can finally get our Barney killer.

02:34:57.584 --> 02:34:58.204
[SPEAKER_03]: Barney Sniper.

02:34:58.224 --> 02:34:59.345
[SPEAKER_07]: That's so 90s.

02:34:59.385 --> 02:35:00.646
[SPEAKER_03]: Birthday Party Barney Sniper.

02:35:00.666 --> 02:35:03.028
[SPEAKER_07]: 20 years after nobody cared about it anymore.

02:35:03.088 --> 02:35:03.688
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

02:35:04.029 --> 02:35:04.529
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on.

02:35:04.909 --> 02:35:12.235
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you all sitting here and telling me that if some company released a game called Birthday Party Barney Sniper, you would not be the least bit interested?

02:35:12.295 --> 02:35:13.496
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I would not be actually.

02:35:13.516 --> 02:35:14.016
[SPEAKER_03]: For real?

02:35:14.096 --> 02:35:14.977
[SPEAKER_03]: I am so over that.

02:35:15.037 --> 02:35:15.898
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me.

02:35:16.258 --> 02:35:17.439
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me, Shane.

02:35:17.759 --> 02:35:19.140
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:35:40.316 --> 02:36:07.411
[SPEAKER_07]: but they are doing a Power Rangers Samurai Connect game I told people at work that also care about Power Rangers and they all freaked out about that just like I did so that work there will at least be four people that buy that game well there you go and that's all the copies that will sell that's more people than bought President Cat in Japan alright Shane anything else you want to share with us tonight or ask about or whatever

02:36:08.188 --> 02:36:09.269
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, my eye hurts.

02:36:09.289 --> 02:36:10.550
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that count?

02:36:11.070 --> 02:36:14.813
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but here, let me ask you about this, since you're the guy that always likes to talk about Mass Effect.

02:36:15.454 --> 02:36:16.174
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I am.

02:36:16.835 --> 02:36:20.137
[SPEAKER_03]: What did you think about my little negative aspect of Mass Effect 3?

02:36:20.177 --> 02:36:22.980
[SPEAKER_03]: Some people in the chatroom didn't take too well to that.

02:36:23.100 --> 02:36:27.363
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, say it one more time for me, because I don't know if I fully grasped what you said.

02:36:27.383 --> 02:36:37.191
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like that it's not that I hate that you have to play multiplayer in order to do better in single player, especially in light of the whole iOS thing.

02:36:37.951 --> 02:36:50.421
[SPEAKER_03]: I really hate that A, it's the easiest way to do it and B, what really pisses me off is the fact that you can buy those little boxes with Microsoft points as well as in-game credits because to me that's trying to have your cake and eat it too.

02:36:50.461 --> 02:36:55.665
[SPEAKER_03]: You're trying to do a free Facebook game and charge me $60 for the game up front.

02:36:55.685 --> 02:36:57.627
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I didn't like about it.

02:36:57.867 --> 02:37:06.714
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really agree with your negativity because A, if there are people that want to pay real money to unlock

02:37:07.788 --> 02:37:13.611
[SPEAKER_07]: Extra guns or extra customization on their characters instead of just playing through the modes like you should.

02:37:13.991 --> 02:37:14.411
[SPEAKER_07]: Let them.

02:37:14.651 --> 02:37:17.332
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not making me pay for it, so I don't really care.

02:37:17.352 --> 02:37:22.094
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm saying please don't do it because you're encouraging them to do it in other stuff and more often.

02:37:22.154 --> 02:37:24.055
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a bad precedent to set.

02:37:24.455 --> 02:37:26.417
[SPEAKER_07]: If these people don't do it, someone else will.

02:37:38.993 --> 02:37:39.693
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura.com

02:38:03.387 --> 02:38:16.899
[SPEAKER_07]: Even if there wasn't an iOS game to help you raise your galactic readiness level, I hated the idea of having to play multiplayer just to get a quote-unquote better ending because they all suck.

02:38:17.540 --> 02:38:17.820
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

02:38:18.723 --> 02:38:19.963
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

02:38:38.110 --> 02:38:41.572
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought you were going to try and recruit somebody to play with us.

02:39:00.908 --> 02:39:02.669
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope, can't play tonight, that person.

02:39:02.689 --> 02:39:08.191
[SPEAKER_07]: So you need to send out some sort of whatever you call it.

02:39:08.832 --> 02:39:10.472
[SPEAKER_03]: Get on Xbox after the show.

02:39:10.532 --> 02:39:11.713
[SPEAKER_03]: Mass Effect 3 meetup.

02:39:12.253 --> 02:39:12.713
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

02:39:13.514 --> 02:39:13.734
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

02:39:14.874 --> 02:39:16.135
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll be the ones dying a lot.

02:39:16.595 --> 02:39:19.957
[SPEAKER_07]: Just in case they can't find us where the corpse is.

02:39:20.577 --> 02:39:22.238
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I gotta let you go so we can get some more calls.

02:39:22.978 --> 02:39:23.358
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine.

02:39:23.378 --> 02:39:24.899
[SPEAKER_03]: You go check out my eye because it hurts.

02:39:25.099 --> 02:39:25.419
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:39:25.639 --> 02:39:27.160
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you didn't ruin your eye.

02:39:27.260 --> 02:39:27.520
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

02:39:28.300 --> 02:39:29.601
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

02:39:29.621 --> 02:39:33.382
[SPEAKER_03]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or I use your name on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:39:33.442 --> 02:39:37.504
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to, you know, give us a call.

02:39:37.684 --> 02:39:39.345
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hey to us on the VOG Network.

02:39:40.565 --> 02:39:42.286
[SPEAKER_03]: Here we are after all on VOG.

02:39:43.166 --> 02:39:44.106
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, we got another call coming in.

02:39:45.247 --> 02:39:46.187
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:39:46.207 --> 02:39:46.547
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

02:39:47.568 --> 02:39:48.328
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, it's Porkchop.

02:39:48.348 --> 02:39:48.728
[SPEAKER_03]: How's it going?

02:39:48.928 --> 02:39:49.889
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I'm good.

02:39:49.929 --> 02:39:50.209
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you?

02:39:51.215 --> 02:39:51.816
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not too bad.

02:39:51.836 --> 02:39:56.340
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to say, first of all, congratulations, and I hope VOG goes well for you guys.

02:39:56.780 --> 02:39:57.181
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

02:39:57.221 --> 02:39:57.961
[SPEAKER_03]: We hope so, too.

02:39:58.141 --> 02:39:59.963
[SPEAKER_03]: If it crashes and burns, well, oh, well.

02:40:00.003 --> 02:40:00.724
[SPEAKER_03]: It was fun trying.

02:40:02.697 --> 02:40:03.297
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I doubt it.

02:40:03.317 --> 02:40:04.778
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys do a pretty good job anyway.

02:40:04.998 --> 02:40:05.539
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, though?

02:40:05.959 --> 02:40:06.820
[SPEAKER_03]: This is important to say.

02:40:06.920 --> 02:40:11.042
[SPEAKER_03]: When we started Orange Launch Radio and the old network, I think you can, you know, I can't say this enough.

02:40:11.463 --> 02:40:20.268
[SPEAKER_03]: We did Orange Launch Radio for 12 people for a very long time, you know, and a lot of people really didn't know about us.

02:40:20.288 --> 02:40:23.070
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not like we have thousands and thousands of listeners now.

02:40:23.450 --> 02:40:26.772
[SPEAKER_03]: It's relatively still a really small show, but we're okay with that.

02:40:26.832 --> 02:40:30.575
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we feel like we're really connected with our community, and it's cool.

02:40:31.255 --> 02:40:31.596
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.

02:40:31.856 --> 02:40:35.020
[SPEAKER_06]: I suppose it's a very dedicated kind of community as well.

02:40:35.060 --> 02:40:36.782
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, I like this.

02:40:37.463 --> 02:40:40.086
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess you got me staying up till all hours.

02:40:41.308 --> 02:40:42.710
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that is a great compliment.

02:40:42.730 --> 02:40:45.533
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to talk too much because I can't talk over you all the time.

02:40:45.813 --> 02:40:46.154
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right.

02:40:46.314 --> 02:40:52.600
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to say, when you sacrifice the greatness that is sleep to listen to this show, we take it as a great compliment.

02:40:52.881 --> 02:40:56.044
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, what did you want to talk about or ask us about tonight?

02:40:56.504 --> 02:40:59.227
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to mention, remember you were talking about Six Axes.

02:40:59.307 --> 02:41:03.451
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the games that was pretty overlooked, I don't know if many people bought it, was Loco Roco.

02:41:03.892 --> 02:41:06.995
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember buying that on PSN and I played the shit out of that.

02:41:07.515 --> 02:41:09.157
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, on PSP it was okay, but...

02:41:10.137 --> 02:41:12.581
[SPEAKER_06]: You could actually control everything with the six axis.

02:41:13.042 --> 02:41:16.247
[SPEAKER_06]: You could rotate the screen, you could turn everything around and stuff.

02:41:16.848 --> 02:41:19.272
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, that was one of the best ones, I think.

02:41:20.870 --> 02:41:23.472
[SPEAKER_05]: Was that a gun that went off in the background?

02:41:24.692 --> 02:41:26.253
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it was my Android.

02:41:26.273 --> 02:41:28.634
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, what the hell is that?

02:41:28.674 --> 02:41:31.255
[SPEAKER_06]: People are sending me messages in chat while I'm actually talking.

02:41:31.976 --> 02:41:32.256
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

02:41:32.556 --> 02:41:33.236
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a duck.

02:41:33.656 --> 02:41:34.917
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they have ducks over there?

02:41:35.357 --> 02:41:35.497
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

02:41:36.038 --> 02:41:38.519
[SPEAKER_03]: LocoRoco is pretty awesome.

02:41:38.539 --> 02:41:38.879
[SPEAKER_03]: You're right.

02:41:38.999 --> 02:41:41.340
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot about LocoRoco, and that's a good one to remind us of.

02:41:41.780 --> 02:41:46.543
[SPEAKER_03]: Does this mean LocoRoco needs to show up in the Sony Super Battle Royale Uber?

02:41:46.563 --> 02:41:47.123
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure they will.

02:41:47.823 --> 02:41:48.904
[SPEAKER_03]: A LocoRoco level?

02:41:49.264 --> 02:41:49.725
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good idea.

02:41:49.745 --> 02:41:50.065
[SPEAKER_06]: I want that.

02:41:50.185 --> 02:41:50.665
[SPEAKER_06]: I want that.

02:41:51.986 --> 02:41:52.246
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

02:41:53.447 --> 02:41:54.368
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be hilarious.

02:41:54.388 --> 02:41:59.492
[SPEAKER_06]: You're actually able to flip the screen somehow and turn everyone on their heads.

02:41:59.652 --> 02:42:01.773
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, Porkchop should be designing games.

02:42:01.853 --> 02:42:02.734
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that idea.

02:42:02.834 --> 02:42:06.356
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole flip the screen, get a power-up that does that.

02:42:06.537 --> 02:42:07.277
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that would be awesome.

02:42:07.958 --> 02:42:08.098
[SPEAKER_06]: Smart.

02:42:08.118 --> 02:42:08.798
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be awesome.

02:42:09.679 --> 02:42:12.641
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Porkchop, are you looking forward to the Super Sony Fighter or whatever it's called?

02:42:14.376 --> 02:42:15.356
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm in two minds about it.

02:42:15.396 --> 02:42:19.320
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the first I've heard of it was tonight, so I'm still thinking about it.

02:42:19.380 --> 02:42:20.861
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm wondering, is it going to be worthwhile?

02:42:20.901 --> 02:42:23.063
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's not going to be Super Smash Bros.

02:42:23.083 --> 02:42:23.723
[SPEAKER_06]: That was fun.

02:42:24.304 --> 02:42:30.168
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, I mean, as long as Microsoft don't try it, I mean, that's going to be an all-time piece of shit, if you ask me.

02:42:30.909 --> 02:42:34.292
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just going to be 12 Master Chiefs, as it was said in chat.

02:42:35.753 --> 02:42:36.934
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we'll see.

02:42:37.034 --> 02:42:37.895
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what happens.

02:42:37.935 --> 02:42:38.195
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:42:38.435 --> 02:42:40.317
[SPEAKER_03]: Portchop, is there anything else you want to share with us tonight?

02:42:41.503 --> 02:42:45.326
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, yeah, kickfarter for that Barney sniper party thingamajig.

02:42:45.346 --> 02:42:47.387
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I definitely want to see Barney get shot in the head.

02:42:47.547 --> 02:42:48.407
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're talking.

02:42:48.447 --> 02:42:49.628
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when I can get behind.

02:42:51.349 --> 02:42:52.450
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, poor Chop.

02:42:52.510 --> 02:42:53.270
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one, buddy.

02:42:53.290 --> 02:42:53.931
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for calling.

02:42:54.651 --> 02:42:55.352
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one, guys.

02:42:55.432 --> 02:42:55.852
[SPEAKER_03]: All the best.

02:42:56.092 --> 02:42:56.693
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, you too.

02:42:56.773 --> 02:42:57.573
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

02:42:59.494 --> 02:43:00.515
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's go to the phones.

02:43:00.555 --> 02:43:01.355
[SPEAKER_03]: We have more calls coming in.

02:43:01.375 --> 02:43:02.276
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:43:02.296 --> 02:43:02.656
[SPEAKER_03]: Who's this?

02:43:04.177 --> 02:43:07.179
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, um, hi, this is, uh, this is RawSteelUT.

02:43:07.659 --> 02:43:09.480
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, RawSteelUT, what's up, buddy?

02:43:09.861 --> 02:43:10.161
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

02:43:11.901 --> 02:43:15.844
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing much, you know, just wanted to call, say congratulations.

02:43:16.144 --> 02:43:18.646
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, we're just really happy to be here.

02:43:21.048 --> 02:43:21.788
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet, man.

02:43:21.828 --> 02:43:30.894
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, I'm looking forward to seeing where VOG goes from here and hell, where all games go from here.

02:43:31.175 --> 02:43:32.816
[SPEAKER_03]: Me too, on both fronts.

02:43:33.376 --> 02:43:34.777
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be exciting for both.

02:43:36.098 --> 02:43:39.721
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I just hope that all games are going to go the direction of G4.

02:43:39.741 --> 02:43:39.901
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

02:43:40.996 --> 02:43:42.157
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be interesting.

02:43:42.217 --> 02:43:42.537
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, um...

02:44:05.782 --> 02:44:09.068
[SPEAKER_01]: Just on a technical note, I've noticed I've been getting some feedback when I'm talking.

02:44:09.369 --> 02:44:10.952
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been hearing pieces of myself.

02:44:11.266 --> 02:44:32.933
[SPEAKER_03]: You might, yeah, because in studio here we're too cheap to have headsets for everybody so we actually play the calls over the speaker so sometimes you get picked up just a little bit by our microphone so sometimes our callers complain of that so apologies about that but, you know, one of these days we'll have to go, I don't know, sell things on the side of the freeway to get money for proper headphones for everybody.

02:44:32.993 --> 02:44:36.314
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, that was something I thought about doing for the studio but just never got around to it.

02:44:36.474 --> 02:44:36.854
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway.

02:44:38.537 --> 02:44:40.199
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that might be a good idea.

02:44:40.219 --> 02:44:43.421
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not like you can't get office headsets or something.

02:44:43.722 --> 02:44:44.322
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, of course, of course.

02:44:44.382 --> 02:44:47.285
[SPEAKER_03]: I just thought it was just a hiccup from the station condition.

02:44:47.305 --> 02:44:47.405
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

02:45:06.530 --> 02:45:08.531
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, lately I've been playing a lot of Soul Calibur.

02:45:08.891 --> 02:45:09.572
[SPEAKER_01]: Soul Calibur 5.

02:45:10.212 --> 02:45:10.993
[SPEAKER_03]: Soul Calibur 5.

02:45:11.653 --> 02:45:16.576
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, one of our listeners and I were trying to meet up to play, and it just wasn't working out for various reasons.

02:45:16.956 --> 02:45:20.278
[SPEAKER_03]: But, man, some of the custom creations.

02:45:20.298 --> 02:45:22.219
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think he posted some of them on Facebook.

02:45:22.279 --> 02:45:23.920
[SPEAKER_03]: Stan posted it on Facebook.

02:45:24.920 --> 02:45:27.362
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hilarious what people are doing with those custom characters.

02:45:27.402 --> 02:45:28.262
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so robust.

02:45:28.622 --> 02:45:30.063
[SPEAKER_03]: But, yeah, Soul Calibur 5 is a good time.

02:45:31.344 --> 02:45:31.704
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

02:45:31.744 --> 02:45:33.245
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw this one video on YouTube.

02:45:33.265 --> 02:45:34.226
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a Voldo player.

02:45:34.566 --> 02:45:34.786
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh.

02:45:35.906 --> 02:45:43.592
[SPEAKER_01]: and he made this character based off of Waldo with a huge purple furry phallus.

02:45:43.913 --> 02:45:52.760
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I was just going to say it's an old classic saying that we say about video games.

02:45:52.820 --> 02:45:54.121
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called time to penis.

02:45:54.521 --> 02:45:57.743
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever something new comes out, it's the TTP, the time to penis.

02:45:58.084 --> 02:46:04.689
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever something new comes out where there's either a peripheral... For a peripheral, it's how long until someone puts their dick on it.

02:46:06.730 --> 02:46:15.513
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, it was not long at all.

02:46:15.573 --> 02:46:19.395
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the YouTube video was from February, so it was very soon after the game came out.

02:46:19.415 --> 02:46:20.896
[SPEAKER_04]: It was not long at all, that's what she said.

02:46:20.996 --> 02:46:24.237
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it was ridiculous.

02:46:25.597 --> 02:46:34.101
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing that, I'm sorry, I'm laughing a bit, but the thing that's got me about, since I've been playing a lot of Soul Calibur, is that

02:46:34.688 --> 02:46:40.891
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very hard to find fighting coverage that isn't really centered around Capcom.

02:46:42.112 --> 02:46:56.740
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gotten to the point where, I don't know if you follow tournaments at all, but it really feels like a lot of the players are forcing themselves with Street Fighter X Seconds, because playing the Capcom games seems to be the only way to get any coverage.

02:46:58.533 --> 02:46:59.954
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's the thing.

02:46:59.974 --> 02:47:00.814
[SPEAKER_03]: Technically, it's a Capcom game.

02:47:00.834 --> 02:47:02.094
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing is, people play these games seriously.

02:47:02.114 --> 02:47:04.035
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, maybe not as much, but there's still a lot of people.

02:47:04.095 --> 02:47:04.295
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean...

02:47:23.737 --> 02:47:28.759
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Soul Calibur V and Mortal Kombat 9 are part of the games being featured in Major League Gaming now.

02:47:29.340 --> 02:47:33.301
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, it's hard to find coverage if it's not a Dicastron game.

02:47:33.321 --> 02:47:35.903
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard to find, you know, people talking about it.

02:47:35.963 --> 02:47:40.685
[SPEAKER_01]: People, you know, any sort of coverage of the events or things like that.

02:47:41.434 --> 02:47:42.394
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you think that is?

02:47:42.894 --> 02:47:44.975
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, as you're saying that, you're kind of right.

02:47:45.035 --> 02:47:49.616
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever I hear about fighting game community, it does seem like Capcom first, other games second.

02:47:49.636 --> 02:47:53.798
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, granted, there are other games like Stance as King of Fighters, which is another good one too.

02:47:54.078 --> 02:47:55.578
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Soul Calibur, as was mentioned.

02:47:55.618 --> 02:47:58.519
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like there's not other good fighting games out there, but you're kind of right.

02:47:58.579 --> 02:48:03.401
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever I hear about fighting game tournaments and who's popular, it's always Street Fighter something that it comes down to.

02:48:03.741 --> 02:48:04.301
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is that?

02:48:04.341 --> 02:48:05.181
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you think that is?

02:48:06.982 --> 02:48:08.322
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's hard to tell.

02:48:08.362 --> 02:48:11.143
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously part of it is because, you know,

02:48:11.656 --> 02:48:14.499
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the first big fighting games was Street Fighter 2.

02:48:15.179 --> 02:48:18.282
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's the jump off for a lot of players.

02:48:18.743 --> 02:48:19.043
[SPEAKER_03]: True.

02:48:19.423 --> 02:48:28.231
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think at this point, you have a lot of major sites that really, you know, it's like anything else.

02:48:28.251 --> 02:48:29.853
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to go out of their wheelhouse.

02:48:30.453 --> 02:48:35.178
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of frustrating when you have to dig around for science sites for other games.

02:48:37.102 --> 02:48:42.836
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to tell you though, my experience was a lot different when I was teenager and young adult in Alabama.

02:48:43.277 --> 02:48:44.119
[SPEAKER_11]: It was all Mortal Kombat 2.

02:48:45.817 --> 02:48:47.679
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, because the blood was cool.

02:48:48.299 --> 02:48:48.640
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, no.

02:48:49.421 --> 02:48:52.283
[SPEAKER_10]: When we did our tournaments at my college, it was on Killer Instinct.

02:48:52.323 --> 02:48:53.965
[SPEAKER_10]: We didn't have any Street Fighter machines.

02:48:54.005 --> 02:48:55.867
[SPEAKER_10]: We had a Vampire Savior.

02:48:55.887 --> 02:49:03.774
[SPEAKER_03]: That would also be the period of time, though, when all the Street Fighter games that were coming out were essentially just Street Fighter 2 Champions, Street Fighter 2 Turbo, Street Fighter 2 Super.

02:49:04.054 --> 02:49:10.020
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was Street Fighter 3, which kind of, I mean, it didn't have that same fire.

02:49:10.080 --> 02:49:14.603
[SPEAKER_10]: It's funny to hear that because the way it's presented to me and the way I remember from my own youth is that everybody gravitated to Street Fighter.

02:49:34.607 --> 02:49:35.868
[SPEAKER_01]: and it seems to continue.

02:49:36.229 --> 02:49:37.970
[SPEAKER_10]: That might be more of a West Coast thing.

02:49:38.230 --> 02:49:46.696
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is, well, it is also, I think if you look at the internet and a lot of stuff, like a lot of the fighting game stuff on the internet, I don't doubt what Raw Steel is saying at all.

02:49:46.736 --> 02:49:50.879
[SPEAKER_03]: It does seem to be heavily dominated with Street Fighter, especially the esports stuff.

02:49:51.240 --> 02:49:54.622
[SPEAKER_03]: All this stuff we're talking about, that didn't exist in the era you're talking about.

02:49:54.742 --> 02:49:57.424
[SPEAKER_03]: Esports wasn't a thing back then, you know?

02:49:57.504 --> 02:49:59.186
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that it's... Even before esports...

02:50:01.400 --> 02:50:30.079
[SPEAKER_03]: like when Mortal Kombat came out I remember a lot of people didn't take it seriously and the post arcade Mortal Kombat they never got any tournament play even though they were popular games Mortal Kombat 3 especially was kind of a joke in the fighting game community because of all the not just the over the top stuff but the combos and the juggles that go on forever and just kind of the style is so much different I remember that game was really not well received by the fighting game community you know casual people liked it enough but

02:50:31.742 --> 02:50:38.107
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny you say that because a lot of people, they're huge into Marvel.

02:50:39.668 --> 02:50:43.711
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all bullshit juggles and 99-hit combos and shit like that.

02:50:43.871 --> 02:50:44.311
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true.

02:50:44.571 --> 02:50:47.193
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Ross Steele, I've got to let you go for time.

02:50:47.473 --> 02:50:48.674
[SPEAKER_03]: But thank you so much for calling in.

02:50:48.714 --> 02:50:49.675
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciate it, okay?

02:50:50.856 --> 02:50:51.236
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

02:50:51.256 --> 02:50:51.796
[SPEAKER_01]: See you later.

02:50:51.917 --> 02:50:52.317
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care, buddy.

02:50:53.311 --> 02:50:54.773
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

02:50:54.813 --> 02:50:59.938
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry to those of you that didn't get through, but it was a popular first night here on VOG.

02:51:00.219 --> 02:51:01.019
[SPEAKER_03]: Send us an email.

02:51:01.480 --> 02:51:02.101
[SPEAKER_03]: Put your thoughts there.

02:51:02.141 --> 02:51:02.621
[SPEAKER_03]: Write them down.

02:51:02.661 --> 02:51:03.142
[SPEAKER_03]: Get a pen.

02:51:03.903 --> 02:51:11.511
[SPEAKER_03]: Write them down and then put it in an email and send it to mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com because DarkSakura needs work to do next week, right?

02:51:13.553 --> 02:51:14.293
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my response.

02:51:14.594 --> 02:51:17.255
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go to our Twitter because we got to get some of these out real quick here.

02:51:17.295 --> 02:51:19.676
[SPEAKER_03]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

02:51:19.796 --> 02:51:24.679
[SPEAKER_03]: 13xForever tweets us saying, Loki OLR looks much cuter in this picture than I remember him.

02:51:27.538 --> 02:51:28.919
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:51:47.167 --> 02:51:47.647
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Eddie.

02:51:47.707 --> 02:51:48.648
[SPEAKER_03]: That was from the Eddie set.

02:51:49.108 --> 02:51:53.909
[SPEAKER_03]: Tia did the very, very first one a long time ago that was on the album art for a while, and Eddie did a set.

02:51:54.529 --> 02:51:55.169
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that's right.

02:51:55.409 --> 02:51:56.529
[SPEAKER_11]: God, my hair was awful in that.

02:51:56.669 --> 02:51:57.330
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

02:51:57.350 --> 02:51:58.010
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I loved it.

02:51:58.410 --> 02:51:58.870
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway.

02:51:58.910 --> 02:51:59.590
[SPEAKER_11]: It was awful.

02:52:00.230 --> 02:52:00.890
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you looked cute.

02:52:01.351 --> 02:52:02.471
[SPEAKER_03]: But we need new ones.

02:52:02.611 --> 02:52:04.231
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to find a photographer friend.

02:52:04.251 --> 02:52:05.612
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe, I know a couple.

02:52:05.752 --> 02:52:07.492
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get some new ones taken.

02:52:08.052 --> 02:52:09.473
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see how cute Loki is now.

02:52:11.883 --> 02:52:14.806
[SPEAKER_04]: Trials Evolution popularity is due to true skill, according to RedLynx.

02:52:29.922 --> 02:52:38.487
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Trials Evolution, of course, is on the Xbox Live Arcade, and it set a one-day sales record, uh, apparently because of how well Trials HD had done.

02:52:38.827 --> 02:52:43.309
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the game that's, like, kinda excite-bikey, at least that's what it is at first look.

02:52:44.090 --> 02:52:44.190
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

02:52:45.611 --> 02:52:48.714
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are people loving this so much?

02:52:49.434 --> 02:52:57.622
[SPEAKER_03]: According to Taro Vertala, who's the managing director at RedLynx, I think there is a more positive explanation than sheer masochism.

02:52:57.983 --> 02:53:04.809
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like in real life when you start practicing something very physics-based like tennis or billiards, there's no limit to how far you can develop your skills.

02:53:05.149 --> 02:53:07.732
[SPEAKER_03]: In trials, it's also about your own true skill.

02:53:08.172 --> 02:53:10.573
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the skill of your avatar or game character.

02:53:10.933 --> 02:53:14.895
[SPEAKER_03]: The sense of accomplishment is that much more genuine because it was all your own doing.

02:53:14.975 --> 02:53:16.615
[SPEAKER_03]: Your skill, your persistence.

02:53:16.795 --> 02:53:20.357
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, I believe they are referring to not a picture of me, but a picture of my cat.

02:53:20.517 --> 02:53:22.237
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, my cat is much cuter than I am.

02:53:23.238 --> 02:53:24.178
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, is that what it is?

02:53:25.719 --> 02:53:27.719
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, because you just tweeted a picture of your cat.

02:53:27.819 --> 02:53:30.060
[SPEAKER_04]: I put the cat in there for size reference, okay?

02:53:30.080 --> 02:53:33.241
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's large.

02:53:33.261 --> 02:53:35.122
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone asked right at the beginning, is that Shermie?

02:53:35.182 --> 02:53:37.223
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, no, Shermie hasn't moved to Loki's house.

02:53:37.768 --> 02:53:44.194
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, moving on, TigerClaw says there's a Portal cartoon being made, what?

02:53:44.955 --> 02:53:49.199
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I didn't hear about this Is this a real thing or is this a fan thing?

02:53:49.219 --> 02:53:54.604
[SPEAKER_03]: Well it's a fan thing I shouldn't say it like that, it's not like a fan thing can't be real, I should say is this an officially endorsed thing?

02:53:55.645 --> 02:53:58.987
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but it's being done by a professional animator.

02:53:59.207 --> 02:54:00.828
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Alex Zemke.

02:54:01.268 --> 02:54:12.036
[SPEAKER_04]: He worked on the movies called Companionship, and he is a professional animator who, in credits, include Disney movies like G-Force and The Smurfs, as well as Uncharted 2 and 3.

02:54:13.637 --> 02:54:14.117
[SPEAKER_03]: Very cool.

02:54:14.137 --> 02:54:16.539
[SPEAKER_04]: And it looks very interesting if you want to.

02:54:16.559 --> 02:54:18.180
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the art style kind of looks like those movies.

02:54:18.200 --> 02:54:19.120
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see this.

02:54:19.200 --> 02:54:20.161
[SPEAKER_03]: That looks awesome.

02:54:20.801 --> 02:54:21.762
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you go, guy.

02:54:22.322 --> 02:54:23.063
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you get it done.

02:54:25.499 --> 02:54:29.463
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just trying to quickly see if there's any other tweets to read.

02:54:29.663 --> 02:54:32.165
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to leave it at that because we're trying to wrap up shop tonight.

02:54:32.185 --> 02:54:33.666
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry if I didn't get to you tonight.

02:54:34.086 --> 02:54:35.107
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a popular night.

02:54:35.147 --> 02:54:35.728
[SPEAKER_03]: What can I say?

02:54:36.248 --> 02:54:37.609
[SPEAKER_03]: Any other last-minute stories from Loki?

02:54:38.150 --> 02:54:47.718
[SPEAKER_04]: Just real quick, there was apparently an effort to remake Pokemon Crystal for the Game Boy Advance, and apparently it is finished.

02:54:47.898 --> 02:54:53.563
[SPEAKER_04]: So now there's Pokemon... What do they call it now?

02:54:54.404 --> 02:54:56.225
[SPEAKER_04]: Liquid Crystal You hear that, Shane?

02:54:58.727 --> 02:55:00.168
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess... Well, actually, no.

02:55:00.208 --> 02:55:02.851
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not done yet, but it's available to pick up.

02:55:03.191 --> 02:55:04.852
[SPEAKER_04]: Beta 3.1 is out now.

02:55:04.872 --> 02:55:07.875
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, you need a flash cart or an emulator to play it.

02:55:08.075 --> 02:55:08.696
[SPEAKER_11]: You hear that, Shane?

02:55:10.017 --> 02:55:11.658
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure he's listening.

02:55:12.879 --> 02:55:13.420
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks neat.

02:55:16.423 --> 02:55:20.585
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, why am I not surprised to see a Price is Right Save Mart ad right here on your table?

02:55:20.885 --> 02:55:30.529
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you must know, we had like a stack of stickers like that high and we were trying to collect and win.

02:55:31.369 --> 02:55:37.732
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for telling everybody my business and how Alan and I have turned into extreme couponers in our spare time.

02:55:38.732 --> 02:55:41.453
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, we got some good deals.

02:55:41.874 --> 02:55:42.534
[SPEAKER_11]: It's adorkable.

02:55:44.184 --> 02:55:55.213
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, if that's it, then we're going to go around and wrap up the show and say goodnight to everybody and close up our very first show here on the Voice of Geeks Network or the VOG.

02:55:56.514 --> 02:55:57.795
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, I'll let you go first.

02:55:57.815 --> 02:55:58.775
[SPEAKER_03]: You already packed your shit up.

02:55:58.795 --> 02:55:59.316
[SPEAKER_03]: You're ready to go.

02:55:59.396 --> 02:56:02.198
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, just because I got to go to bed because I have work tomorrow.

02:56:02.398 --> 02:56:03.279
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your final thought tonight?

02:56:03.359 --> 02:56:04.260
[SPEAKER_11]: I have indigestion.

02:56:04.820 --> 02:56:05.721
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry to hear that.

02:56:07.855 --> 02:56:11.458
[SPEAKER_11]: and reject false icons.

02:56:12.319 --> 02:56:13.340
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, your final thought tonight?

02:56:13.520 --> 02:56:22.328
[SPEAKER_04]: The Star Fox video that I'm watching that someone remade the beginning of Star Fox with it's all pretty is pretty neat.

02:56:24.002 --> 02:56:29.025
[SPEAKER_03]: My final thought tonight is please watch the RuPaul's Drag Race finale tomorrow.

02:56:29.446 --> 02:56:31.867
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be awesome and full of surprises.

02:56:32.067 --> 02:56:32.608
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I can say.

02:56:32.628 --> 02:56:33.448
[SPEAKER_09]: Talk about dork.

02:56:33.768 --> 02:56:38.452
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, RuPaul's Drag Race is the best show on TV and it's only going to get better.

02:56:38.492 --> 02:56:39.292
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I'm saying.

02:56:40.133 --> 02:56:41.233
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I did during the show?

02:56:41.373 --> 02:56:41.574
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

02:56:42.274 --> 02:56:48.778
[SPEAKER_11]: I bought a battery recharger for my iPhone to take to Disneyland for $3 including shipping.

02:56:49.559 --> 02:56:50.620
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yay you!

02:56:52.884 --> 02:56:54.565
[SPEAKER_03]: Excuse me, it was my final thought.

02:56:54.645 --> 02:56:55.145
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, anyway.

02:56:56.306 --> 02:56:57.827
[SPEAKER_03]: And the final thought from all of us.

02:56:58.307 --> 02:56:59.048
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys.

02:56:59.348 --> 02:57:01.749
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for listening all the way to the end of the show.

02:57:01.869 --> 02:57:02.710
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are awesome.

02:57:02.730 --> 02:57:04.231
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're listening live, thank you.

02:57:04.891 --> 02:57:06.212
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you to the podcasters.

02:57:06.252 --> 02:57:07.492
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you guys so much for listening to us.

02:57:07.553 --> 02:57:10.514
[SPEAKER_03]: And most importantly, following us on our crazy adventures.

02:57:10.594 --> 02:57:12.836
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a huge first night for us here on VOG.

02:57:13.176 --> 02:57:19.239
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't think that we'd have quite the audience that showed up tonight, especially with as little notice, less than 24 hours notice.

02:57:19.559 --> 02:57:20.520
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys fucking packed the house.

02:57:20.560 --> 02:57:21.881
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, tell a friend

02:57:42.328 --> 02:57:43.690
[SPEAKER_03]: about Orange Lounge Radio.

02:57:43.810 --> 02:57:44.531
[SPEAKER_03]: It's word of mouth.

02:57:44.652 --> 02:57:46.494
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't ask for your money to do this show.

02:57:46.815 --> 02:57:48.097
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't run ads or anything.

02:57:48.137 --> 02:57:52.743
[SPEAKER_03]: We just want to spread the love and spread the word.

02:57:52.763 --> 02:57:53.805
[SPEAKER_03]: We're into oral.

02:57:54.265 --> 02:57:55.347
[SPEAKER_11]: We're into oral.

02:57:56.148 --> 02:57:56.388
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

02:57:57.049 --> 02:57:58.011
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, A-U-R-A-L.

02:57:58.760 --> 02:57:58.980
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

02:58:00.001 --> 02:58:00.701
[SPEAKER_03]: You used your mouth.

02:58:02.203 --> 02:58:02.883
[SPEAKER_03]: You're disgusting.

02:58:03.804 --> 02:58:04.064
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:58:04.344 --> 02:58:04.945
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it, guys.

02:58:05.125 --> 02:58:05.725
[SPEAKER_03]: Until next week.

02:58:05.765 --> 02:58:07.627
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back next week to do it all over again.

02:58:07.687 --> 02:58:08.727
[SPEAKER_03]: We hope you'll come back and join us.

02:58:09.048 --> 02:58:10.809
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a wonderful night, everybody.

02:58:10.909 --> 02:58:12.090
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, it's a new closing.

02:58:12.110 --> 02:58:12.810
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to redo it.

02:58:13.050 --> 02:58:13.631
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a great night.

02:58:15.174 --> 02:58:18.196
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:58:18.836 --> 02:58:23.059
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.

02:58:23.660 --> 02:58:32.526
