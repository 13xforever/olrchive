WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:20.160
Tonight, April 29, 2012, the release date leaks for one big game this fall, Nintendo

00:20.160 --> 00:25.280
will bring retail digital downloads to the Wii U, and could Microsoft be planning another

00:25.280 --> 00:31.800
music service?

00:31.800 --> 00:36.480
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to the show where every gamer

00:36.480 --> 00:39.840
has a voice, Orange Lounge Radio.

00:39.840 --> 00:48.520
We are live as we are every week at VOG Network, vognetwork.com, six o'clock Pacific, nine

00:48.520 --> 00:51.960
o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show.

00:51.960 --> 00:54.840
You can join us in our chat room at vognetwork.com.

00:54.840 --> 00:57.880
I'll be talking more about the chat and some of those changes in just a minute, but my

00:57.880 --> 01:01.560
name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video

01:01.560 --> 01:02.920
games and lols.

01:02.920 --> 01:06.000
With my co-host, say hello to the one and only, Jamie Summers.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Hi.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
How are you?

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
Voggy.

01:09.000 --> 01:13.160
Wait a minute, this isn't a station about volcanic fog.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.280
Wikipedia told me vog is volcanic fog.

01:15.280 --> 01:16.280
What is this?

01:16.280 --> 01:17.840
Wikipedia is wrong.

01:17.840 --> 01:20.680
Alright, also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:20.680 --> 01:21.680
Hello.

01:21.680 --> 01:22.680
How you doing, Loki?

01:22.680 --> 01:23.680
I'm full.

01:23.680 --> 01:24.680
You're full, full of crap.

01:24.680 --> 01:26.600
That's the same joke I made with her last week.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.760
I just ate a big pizza.

01:28.760 --> 01:32.120
I just ate some dried okra.

01:32.120 --> 01:36.000
And I have breadsticks staring at me, but I can't, I can literally not fit any more

01:36.000 --> 01:37.160
into my stomach.

01:37.160 --> 01:39.160
So some things never change.

01:39.160 --> 01:41.160
Some things change, but some things never change.

01:41.160 --> 01:45.720
So I am getting hungry, but just looking at those breadsticks is making me hungry.

01:45.720 --> 01:49.940
Alright, so before we get into our gaming weeks, let's talk about the big obvious thing

01:49.940 --> 01:50.940
that's out there.

01:50.940 --> 01:54.920
We weren't able to talk about it last week because we were trying to transition from

01:54.920 --> 01:57.160
the old network to our new network.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.420
And we're not bitches.

01:58.420 --> 01:59.720
Which is VOG.

01:59.720 --> 02:03.720
And if you haven't heard, it's all over now, Geek-Life.com.

02:03.720 --> 02:06.440
Big thank you to Geek Life, by the way, for doing this for us.

02:06.440 --> 02:11.680
Broke the exclusive late last night that the new network that we were starting with Bobby

02:11.680 --> 02:15.640
and Understation Live will also be a part of in its inaugural phase is called VOG, or

02:15.640 --> 02:18.280
the Voice of Geeks Network.

02:18.280 --> 02:23.340
You know, so you can call it Voice of Geeks Network if you want, but ultimately when you

02:23.340 --> 02:27.720
think of VOG, you won't think of volcanoes anymore, you'll think about our network or

02:27.720 --> 02:31.960
the Voice of Geeks Network, which is expanding a little bit, just like when Orange Lounge

02:31.960 --> 02:35.480
Radio, remember Orange Lounge Radio was a station when it first started.

02:35.480 --> 02:39.800
So in some ways this is going back to those roots a little bit, but so much bigger now.

02:39.800 --> 02:40.800
Our eyes are...

02:40.800 --> 02:41.800
We started over.

02:41.800 --> 02:42.800
That's right.

02:42.800 --> 02:45.120
We are starting over.

02:45.120 --> 02:49.840
You know, it's not just about Bomani, it's not just about games, it's about all things

02:49.840 --> 02:52.200
geek is what this station is all about.

02:52.200 --> 02:55.160
And you know, that's going to be reflected in the playlist, that's going to be reflected

02:55.160 --> 02:59.280
in, you know, the shows that you're going to hear on the network, and most importantly,

02:59.280 --> 03:01.020
it's not just a radio network.

03:01.020 --> 03:07.480
The VOG network is going to be a whole website that has other things as well, forums and

03:07.480 --> 03:12.300
you know, other ways to interact with folks and some really exciting maybe meta games.

03:12.300 --> 03:15.400
I don't want to spoil too much, but just say there's great things in store for VOG.

03:15.400 --> 03:20.360
The site that you see there now at vognetwork.com, kind of a temporary, what we call the phase

03:20.360 --> 03:23.360
one, so that you guys have a way to continue to listen to us.

03:23.360 --> 03:27.640
And so that way our shows aren't interrupted at all, but the later phases are going to

03:27.640 --> 03:28.640
bring more.

03:28.640 --> 03:33.780
More shows to the radio network, more things to see and do on the website.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.040
It's going to be great.

03:35.040 --> 03:39.960
So going to our chat room at chat.orangeloungeradio.com.

03:39.960 --> 03:42.560
Let's see, who do I give the first chat comment to tonight?

03:42.560 --> 03:47.600
I'm going to give it to Hecht, who calls VOG the voice of God network.

03:47.600 --> 03:51.200
No, that's a whole other network.

03:51.200 --> 03:54.360
That might be, you know, got to go through the religious programming to get that.

03:54.360 --> 03:59.540
And if you pay us $50,000, you'll be guaranteed a place in heaven.

03:59.540 --> 04:07.080
Speaking of chat, we're saying goodbye to our old chat room, which was at chat.orangeloungeradio.com,

04:07.080 --> 04:09.660
and it was Channel Orange Lounge on IRC.

04:09.660 --> 04:11.240
We're saying goodbye to that.

04:11.240 --> 04:15.400
And I know some people are like, I don't like change, why do things have to change?

04:15.400 --> 04:21.400
But we wanted to, you know, for a long time when we were at our old home, we had one chat

04:21.400 --> 04:25.120
room, they had another, and things always felt really disconnected.

04:25.120 --> 04:27.060
And it was a little weird.

04:27.060 --> 04:31.840
So we wanted to make sure this time we did it right, and we merge into the general network

04:31.840 --> 04:32.840
chat room.

04:32.840 --> 04:36.660
Especially the fact that the shows that are all starting this network have a lot of listener

04:36.660 --> 04:38.080
overlap anyway.

04:38.080 --> 04:41.860
It really made sense to kind of have a central home or a hub for that.

04:41.860 --> 04:45.580
So our new chat room is Channel VOG.

04:45.580 --> 04:49.960
It's still on the game search network, and if you want to join it really easy using the

04:49.960 --> 04:53.520
Java or whatever, the chat client online, just go to vognetwork.com.

04:53.520 --> 04:54.980
It's like, you can't miss it.

04:54.980 --> 04:55.980
It's right in front of your face.

04:55.980 --> 04:59.860
It's like the biggest thing on the page right now, vognetwork.com, and you will see the

04:59.860 --> 05:01.040
chat.

05:01.040 --> 05:04.920
You don't have to use vognetwork.com to listen to the station.

05:04.920 --> 05:09.760
You have little things that you can copy paste into Winamp and mobile phones and all that.

05:09.760 --> 05:13.320
That is going to be developing all through the coming weeks.

05:13.320 --> 05:16.140
I do want to put this out there for the podcast listeners.

05:16.140 --> 05:20.200
Those that are listening on the podcast, nothing's changed for them.

05:20.200 --> 05:21.920
They're just like, oh, hey, another week, another show.

05:21.920 --> 05:22.920
Here it is.

05:22.920 --> 05:24.960
It sounds the same as it always has, and that's the intention.

05:24.960 --> 05:26.920
It's not supposed to sound any different to you guys.

05:26.920 --> 05:31.900
If you do happen to visit VOG Network during the week, keep in mind we don't have the stream

05:31.900 --> 05:34.540
up 24-7 yet.

05:34.540 --> 05:38.400
That is part of phase two that's going to be implemented within the next couple weeks.

05:38.400 --> 05:39.400
It's going to be fast.

05:39.400 --> 05:42.720
I just don't want you to be surprised if you go to vognetwork.com and it's not Saturday

05:42.720 --> 05:45.720
night or Sunday night, because Saturday is when another station live is on, Sunday is

05:45.720 --> 05:49.060
when we're on with Bobby, you're not going to hear anything.

05:49.060 --> 05:50.880
That's going to be that way for a couple weeks.

05:50.880 --> 05:55.200
We're slowly expanding with the network.

05:55.200 --> 05:56.840
I'm so excited.

05:56.840 --> 05:57.840
It's great.

05:57.840 --> 06:03.320
Sitting at the driver's wheel, being part of having created this, getting to steer this

06:03.320 --> 06:08.360
site in the direction we want to take it for geeks everywhere, and giving everybody a voice

06:08.360 --> 06:12.800
through radio shows, through feature articles, through forums.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.540
It's going to be awesome.

06:14.540 --> 06:15.540
So excited.

06:15.540 --> 06:20.040
All right, so anyhow, let's get back into video games and talk about our gaming week

06:20.040 --> 06:23.800
and so forth, and the stuff we've been playing in the gaming world this week.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.160
Dark Soccer, how was your gaming week?

06:25.160 --> 06:26.160
I ain't played shit.

06:26.160 --> 06:27.160
No, I'm kidding.

06:27.160 --> 06:28.160
What?

06:28.160 --> 06:34.240
Well, and then I reformatted my hard drive and installed Windows 7, only to find out

06:34.240 --> 06:41.560
that I'm missing my entire iTunes collection from about S down, including my ringtones

06:41.560 --> 06:42.560
directory.

06:42.560 --> 06:46.640
So I've lost most of the ringtones that I've made, including my Doctor Who theme from season

06:46.640 --> 06:49.240
10, which makes me irritated beyond all belief.

06:49.240 --> 06:50.240
Well, this is the interweb.

06:50.240 --> 06:51.760
Surely you can find that in a heartbeat.

06:51.760 --> 06:52.960
I made that one.

06:52.960 --> 06:56.160
And the VoG network probably has it in the upcoming playlist.

06:56.160 --> 07:04.040
For anyone who I've ever sent those ringtones to, just send them back to me, please.

07:04.040 --> 07:07.080
So I played some WoW.

07:07.080 --> 07:08.480
I've finally gotten the beta.

07:08.480 --> 07:13.600
Well, I mean, I had the beta key, I just wasn't beta-ing.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.960
Now I am beta-ing.

07:14.960 --> 07:19.460
I've made a panda named Sakurina.

07:19.460 --> 07:24.400
Every time I try to play my 85s that I transferred over, the game crashes on me.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.760
Oops.

07:25.760 --> 07:28.660
So yeah.

07:28.660 --> 07:36.000
And then we were loaned the Tekken Street Fighter poop game, because my friend bought

07:36.000 --> 07:40.320
it on PS3 and promptly said, this is broken, and loaned it to us.

07:40.320 --> 07:43.400
He said, you can play it, I hate it.

07:43.400 --> 07:49.240
So we were going to play it, but things have been busy with me trying to do everything.

07:49.240 --> 07:54.840
And Tigerclaw, I backed up my entire iTunes directory, let it finish, double-checked it,

07:54.840 --> 07:56.480
and somehow half of it was still missing.

07:56.480 --> 07:57.800
So shut up.

07:57.800 --> 07:59.360
You're so nice.

07:59.360 --> 08:00.520
I know.

08:00.520 --> 08:02.520
I'm a wonderful person.

08:02.520 --> 08:06.720
By the way, Tigerclaw had suggested that this is why I make a backup of my entire iTunes

08:06.720 --> 08:08.400
library on a second hard drive.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.040
That's what I did.

08:10.040 --> 08:19.920
So anyway, at any rate, it's just been me trying to play catch-up and working, and I

08:19.920 --> 08:21.880
have two more weeks of school.

08:21.880 --> 08:22.880
Then I'm going to Disneyland.

08:22.880 --> 08:23.880
Oh.

08:23.880 --> 08:24.880
Oh, congrats.

08:24.880 --> 08:28.280
I wish I could go, but I don't think it's going to work out, just with everything else

08:28.280 --> 08:29.280
going on.

08:29.280 --> 08:30.280
Yeah.

08:30.280 --> 08:31.280
Okay.

08:31.280 --> 08:32.280
LOL, bye.

08:32.280 --> 08:33.280
Bye.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.280
You want to feature me for me?

08:34.280 --> 08:36.280
Yeah, we can talk about that offline.

08:36.280 --> 08:37.280
Why not?

08:37.280 --> 08:38.280
All right.

08:38.280 --> 08:39.280
Techmaster Loki, how was your gaming week?

08:39.280 --> 08:40.280
What'd you do?

08:40.280 --> 08:43.080
I played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3.

08:43.080 --> 08:44.080
That's pretty much it.

08:44.080 --> 08:51.400
Leveled up to 80 offline through some grinding with split-screen Surge and Destroy, which

08:51.400 --> 08:54.440
is a lot faster than the way I was trying to do it.

08:54.440 --> 08:57.600
So we did that, and it's sort of cheating, but who cares?

08:57.600 --> 09:00.960
We're playing offline, so it doesn't matter.

09:00.960 --> 09:05.760
So yeah, that's pretty much all I've played, and then I've been continuing, because I had

09:05.760 --> 09:14.040
started it, god, months ago, but I have been continuing on working on my full-size Papercraft

09:14.040 --> 09:19.920
model of a Portal turret that's about three and a half feet tall, when it will be three

09:19.920 --> 09:23.640
and a half feet tall when it's done.

09:23.640 --> 09:26.600
So I posted a picture in the chat room.

09:26.600 --> 09:32.600
What I have done so far is pretty much the two shells of the actual body minus the gun

09:32.600 --> 09:36.040
doors on there, because those are actually separate pieces, and you can actually make

09:36.040 --> 09:38.960
it with the guns, but I'm not.

09:38.960 --> 09:41.160
I'm just going to keep the doors shut.

09:41.160 --> 09:42.160
Makes it easier.

09:42.160 --> 09:47.040
By the way, we probably should get Rama to put that to the Tumblr, so the podcast listeners

09:47.040 --> 09:49.760
can see this thing that you're building.

09:49.760 --> 09:50.760
We can do it.

09:50.760 --> 09:51.760
All right.

09:51.760 --> 09:53.680
What made you decide you wanted to build this?

09:53.680 --> 09:54.680
Because you can't.

09:54.680 --> 09:55.680
I've known you how long.

09:55.680 --> 09:56.680
Because you can.

09:56.680 --> 09:57.680
You're like, challenge?

09:57.680 --> 09:58.680
Challenge accepted!

09:58.680 --> 10:03.200
It's because it's the cheapest way to get in.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.280
How can I annoy my wife this month?

10:05.280 --> 10:06.980
It's not annoying.

10:06.980 --> 10:10.480
It was actually, this was the cheapest way to go.

10:10.480 --> 10:13.080
This is one of the least annoying projects, I'm sure.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.080
It's just cutting paper.

10:14.080 --> 10:19.400
I mean, it's actually, I think it's cost me so far like 20 bucks, and that's only because

10:19.400 --> 10:23.320
I bought the wrong thickness paper at one point.

10:23.320 --> 10:29.820
But it's just like card stock with glue, the special glue because it's quick drying and

10:29.820 --> 10:31.640
works great.

10:31.640 --> 10:36.760
And then just an X-Acto blade and stuff, but it's coming out pretty well.

10:36.760 --> 10:41.560
The only thing is, once I'm done putting it together, I've got to spray it because it's

10:41.560 --> 10:47.160
got lines all over the place, and then once I'm done spraying it, I have to possibly add

10:47.160 --> 10:50.040
a laser and voice to it as well.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.720
And then you should sell it for a lot of money on Etsy.

10:51.720 --> 10:52.720
No!

10:52.720 --> 10:53.720
It's going to my desk!

10:53.720 --> 10:57.440
And it's not going to be just a regular Portal turret.

10:57.440 --> 11:01.600
It's going to be the, what is it, the one from Portal 2 that you save.

11:01.600 --> 11:04.560
Excuse me, excuse me!

11:04.560 --> 11:06.200
No, that sounds awesome.

11:06.200 --> 11:07.840
I can't wait to see the finished product.

11:07.840 --> 11:09.000
I know you'll bring it to the show.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.000
I will bring it to the show.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.000
I know you will.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.280
It'll be great.

11:12.280 --> 11:16.280
So that whole video content we want to add to VOG eventually, there'll just be a static

11:16.280 --> 11:17.600
camera pointing at your Portal gun.

11:17.600 --> 11:18.600
Sounds good.

11:18.600 --> 11:19.600
Very ominous.

11:19.600 --> 11:20.840
Alright, so my gaming week.

11:20.840 --> 11:23.720
I wish, I was reading some of the comments in chat room, and earlier somebody had brought

11:23.720 --> 11:27.840
up Phantasy Star Online 2, and the whole beta that's going on.

11:27.840 --> 11:31.720
I wish I was playing that, but I guess it's only in Japanese right now, which stinks.

11:31.720 --> 11:33.720
I really want to check that out at some point.

11:33.720 --> 11:38.280
I've had a lot of friends beta testing MMOs this week.

11:38.280 --> 11:42.400
Guild Wars 2 apparently has got their thing going on for people that pre-purchased the

11:42.400 --> 11:43.400
game.

11:43.400 --> 11:47.240
Like, if you already gave them your money, you get to play the game a little early.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.600
It's like an open beta test.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.480
I was going to say, isn't it coming out soon?

11:50.480 --> 11:51.800
Yeah, it's pretty soon.

11:51.800 --> 11:55.720
I am interested in the game, and for those that remember Irene, she used to go by Rice

11:55.720 --> 11:56.920
Princess years ago on this show.

11:56.920 --> 12:00.200
If you remember Irene, she's really into Guild Wars, especially this new one, and she says

12:00.200 --> 12:02.440
the PVP is awesome.

12:02.440 --> 12:05.280
So I'm curious to check that out.

12:05.280 --> 12:09.000
Xtaphir from Hoard House has been playing Terra, which is apparently pretty good.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.740
You can make some very fancy pants looking characters in Terra, so I want to check that

12:12.740 --> 12:15.440
out too, because the graphics in that look really good.

12:15.440 --> 12:19.080
But the MMO that's been taking up my week is of course World of Warcraft.

12:19.080 --> 12:20.320
Hello, what else?

12:20.320 --> 12:26.840
But I have been playing some offline games as well on the Xbox 360, and again, note the

12:26.840 --> 12:30.680
day, note the time, other big news besides the new network.

12:30.680 --> 12:33.440
I didn't just beat one game this year, you guys.

12:33.440 --> 12:35.560
I beat two games this year!

12:35.560 --> 12:36.560
Applause, please.

12:36.560 --> 12:37.560
Good job.

12:37.560 --> 12:38.560
Thank you.

12:38.560 --> 12:39.560
Good job.

12:39.560 --> 12:43.760
So Mass Effect, right, and the new game I beat, Mass Effect 2.

12:43.760 --> 12:49.880
Congratulations, your freight train of soon or intimate disappointment is full speed ahead.

12:49.880 --> 12:51.520
Here's my quote for you.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.680
Yeah, thank you, thank you.

12:54.680 --> 12:58.800
So of course, the other day, I think that was what, probably Monday?

12:58.800 --> 13:03.240
But Rob, when are you going to beat a game that came out this year?

13:03.240 --> 13:09.920
Well, well, smartass, I just started Mass Effect 3!

13:09.920 --> 13:15.000
Go figure, it was on sale for 40 bucks a couple weeks ago, so I picked up a copy of Mass Effect

13:15.000 --> 13:18.360
3, so I had it ready to go, and away I went.

13:18.360 --> 13:24.200
So I've been playing that a little bit, and I gotta say, just like some things, some little

13:24.200 --> 13:28.000
things changed from Mass Effect 1 to Mass Effect 2, more things changed from Mass Effect

13:28.000 --> 13:31.400
3, and I'm really loving it.

13:31.400 --> 13:38.000
Oh my gosh, the story is great, there's much more direct tie-ins to what, like, you see

13:38.000 --> 13:42.760
much more impact from what happened in Game 2, in Game 3, than you really saw between

13:42.760 --> 13:43.760
1 and 2.

13:43.760 --> 13:47.920
It's like they perfected that a little bit, and thankfully, since I say, I may or may

13:47.920 --> 13:52.680
not have had my boyfriend walk me through the final sequence of Part 2, so that way

13:52.680 --> 13:57.520
everybody would stay alive so I could see them in Part 3, so it's really cool getting

13:57.520 --> 14:03.080
to run into everybody and see them in Part 3, and, you know, just the combat is so much

14:03.080 --> 14:04.080
better.

14:04.080 --> 14:07.720
Like, even though they didn't really change a lot, like it's still, you know, you have

14:07.720 --> 14:12.640
your guns and use your powers, everything just feels more fluid, like I can't explain

14:12.640 --> 14:17.000
it, like, and just the graphics are up a notch, it's great, I'm having such a good time with

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
3.

14:18.000 --> 14:24.080
And, here's the crazy part, I'm playing multiplayer, because Mass Effect 3 has a whole multiplayer

14:24.080 --> 14:28.600
thing online that you can go in, and it's basically, it's all co-op, it's not competitive,

14:28.600 --> 14:34.280
you basically do these 4-player co-op matches, and, you know, it's not, it's not as rich

14:34.280 --> 14:38.680
and as full as the main game, but you know that whole thing that apparently every game

14:38.680 --> 14:42.080
has to have multiplayer these days, especially if you're EA, right?

14:42.080 --> 14:46.400
So, Mass Effect now has this multiplayer mode, and it's basically 4-player co-op surviving

14:46.400 --> 14:52.880
10 waves on a map, and it's 10 waves of enemies, but that could be, you know, little enemies,

14:52.880 --> 14:58.200
big enemies, it could be hold a point on the map for a minute, it could be go find the

14:58.200 --> 15:01.880
different markers on the map and activate the beacons or whatever, within a certain

15:01.880 --> 15:04.600
amount of time, there are little modes that they put in it.

15:04.600 --> 15:07.080
But the fact that it's co-op makes it really interesting.

15:07.080 --> 15:11.540
Now, so I've said a lot of great things about Mass Effect 3, right, and I really do truly

15:11.540 --> 15:16.320
love this game, and even if the ending blows ass, which I'm fully expecting it to, I've

15:16.320 --> 15:20.400
already been set up for disappointment, the experience of getting there is fine, like

15:20.400 --> 15:24.960
I feel like, especially because I bought it on sale, it's been money well spent.

15:24.960 --> 15:30.760
By the way, even though I bought these games on sale, I bought every single DLC, well every

15:30.760 --> 15:38.200
single like story DLC for part 2, and I beat all of those as well, Shadow Broker, Arrival,

15:38.200 --> 15:43.700
Overlord, Kasumi, Zaid, I played all of it, so yeah, and that was a very important thing

15:43.700 --> 15:46.320
I had to do before I started 3.

15:46.320 --> 15:52.760
So, speaking of online and DLC, here's my problem with Mass Effect 3, and this is a

15:52.760 --> 15:58.160
big problem, and this is my, this is why I'm going to be hesitant to give this my game

15:58.160 --> 16:05.560
of the year, extremely hesitant to give this my game of the year award, and it's basically

16:05.560 --> 16:09.760
the blatant money grab the EA is going for with this.

16:09.760 --> 16:15.760
In multiplayer, you don't level the same character that you level in single player.

16:15.760 --> 16:20.920
You level your character in multiplayer, and the way you do that is that you earn credits

16:20.920 --> 16:22.480
with every map that you do.

16:22.480 --> 16:26.000
The more waves you survive, the more you contribute, the more credits you get, and if you manage

16:26.000 --> 16:29.680
to make it all the way to the end and get airlifted out, you get a lot of credits.

16:29.680 --> 16:34.200
And you use the credits to buy little boxes that are akin to like a Magic the Gathering

16:34.200 --> 16:35.340
booster pack.

16:35.340 --> 16:41.600
You can buy a cheapy box for 5,000 that'll have cheapy stuff in it, you can buy a slightly

16:41.600 --> 16:47.620
better box for 20,000 credits that has, you know, better stuff and are rare, and then

16:47.620 --> 16:52.220
you can buy like a jumbo box for 60,000 that has like super rare or whatever in it, I'm

16:52.220 --> 16:53.880
kind of paraphrasing here.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.640
But where am I going with this?

16:55.640 --> 17:02.040
Not only can you buy the boxes with in-game credits, but you can buy the boxes with Microsoft

17:02.040 --> 17:06.120
points, and I'm assuming on the PlayStation 3 you can buy it with, you know, PlayStation

17:06.120 --> 17:10.640
store dollars, and on the PC I'm sure you can tap into their EA network and buy them

17:10.640 --> 17:11.640
as well.

17:11.640 --> 17:15.640
So, in other words, you can use money to get ahead in the game.

17:15.640 --> 17:22.640
And the other thing that's a little bit irritating with that is that if you want the A-plus best

17:22.640 --> 17:27.080
way to get through the game, you really have to play multiplayer, because multiplayer ties

17:27.080 --> 17:32.120
into this event called Galactic Readiness that starts at half, 50%.

17:32.120 --> 17:35.920
The more you play multiplayer, the more the Galactic Readiness goes up.

17:35.920 --> 17:42.360
Technically, you can get the best ending if you did everything perfect in Mass Effect

17:42.360 --> 17:45.880
1, everything perfect in Mass Effect 2, like you'd have to use a guide online to do it.

17:45.880 --> 17:49.320
You would absolutely have to use a guide online in order to be able to do it and never touch

17:49.320 --> 17:50.320
multiplayer.

17:50.320 --> 17:54.600
So, in other words, if you want the best ending, which as I understand there isn't that big

17:54.600 --> 17:59.220
of a difference anyway between them, but by the time the DLC comes out maybe that'll change.

17:59.220 --> 18:03.800
If you want the best in single player, you have to play multiplayer, and real money gives

18:03.800 --> 18:08.960
you the edge in order to kind of get there as fast as possible, because they didn't already

18:08.960 --> 18:11.040
take your money when you bought the game.

18:11.040 --> 18:13.680
It makes me not want to play.

18:13.680 --> 18:15.800
It's kind of shitty.

18:15.800 --> 18:23.440
And that EA, that's why you make gamers so angry that they rigged that poll to go vote

18:23.440 --> 18:27.160
you the worst company in America whether you deserved it or not.

18:27.160 --> 18:29.040
That's the problem.

18:29.040 --> 18:32.960
And I think it needs to be called out, because guess what, gaming industry?

18:32.960 --> 18:35.880
You can't have your cake and eat it too.

18:35.880 --> 18:40.200
You don't get to charge people that type of money for a game up front and the additional

18:40.200 --> 18:44.100
DLC and then charge the money for Pokemon packs.

18:44.100 --> 18:45.100
And I know what you're saying.

18:45.100 --> 18:46.880
Well, if you don't like it, then don't buy it.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.200
Rob, it's only gonna get worse.

18:48.200 --> 18:49.200
I know.

18:49.200 --> 18:52.760
I mean, we're gonna get into it later, but we've already gotten a glimpse of the future

18:52.760 --> 18:56.520
and it's only gonna get worse.

18:56.520 --> 19:00.560
AcidicVampire in chat says, yes, but Rob, buying them with money is just an option.

19:00.560 --> 19:04.760
If you beat them multiplayer on silver and gold, you will be swimming in credits.

19:04.760 --> 19:06.320
And I understand that.

19:06.320 --> 19:10.000
But there's some people that aren't gonna wanna play multiplayer that are gonna be tempted

19:10.000 --> 19:11.400
to do that to give them an edge.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.400
Why?

19:12.400 --> 19:14.080
Because it ultimately does affect single player.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.080
And I think that's a very...

19:15.080 --> 19:16.080
I hate multiplayer.

19:16.080 --> 19:17.080
See, that's a poor decision.

19:17.080 --> 19:18.080
That was a...

19:18.080 --> 19:19.080
I don't...

19:19.080 --> 19:21.960
Any way you slice it, having the multiplayer tie in that close to single player was a poor

19:21.960 --> 19:22.960
decision.

19:22.960 --> 19:24.680
I really don't wanna play it now.

19:24.680 --> 19:29.600
I mean, honestly, it just has deflated any desire how to play it.

19:29.600 --> 19:33.520
Well, I think you're robbing yourself of what is otherwise an excellent story and an excellent

19:33.520 --> 19:34.520
game.

19:34.520 --> 19:35.520
To be honest, I mean...

19:35.520 --> 19:36.520
I hate multiplayer games.

19:36.520 --> 19:38.440
Unless they're in the house with me.

19:38.440 --> 19:42.040
Technically, you don't have to play multiplayer, you just won't get the best ending.

19:42.040 --> 19:43.040
Exactly.

19:43.040 --> 19:46.280
Well, even the best ending, it doesn't even matter, because you can actually play multiplayer.

19:46.280 --> 19:50.240
Well, you wouldn't have to buy those packs necessarily to get the experience that you

19:50.240 --> 19:51.240
need.

19:51.240 --> 19:54.960
But like, I mean, there's some other games, Saints Row the Third, that just have really

19:54.960 --> 20:01.160
shitty DLC that they put out at a really expensive amount of money just so that you get more

20:01.160 --> 20:04.120
content to the game and it's just terrible.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.520
It's only like 30 minutes.

20:05.520 --> 20:09.320
Or, hey, we're teasing that there's a character that you love that we decided, hey, we're

20:09.320 --> 20:12.480
gonna fuck you guys up and kill him in the very beginning of the game.

20:12.480 --> 20:14.320
Oh, but he's gonna come back, but not really.

20:14.320 --> 20:18.080
But we're gonna tell you that he's coming back so that you buy this $7 piece of crap.

20:18.080 --> 20:21.760
Tiger Claw in our chatroom says, you don't need to play multiplayer to get the best ending.

20:21.760 --> 20:25.720
There's an app you can download on your iPhone or iPad that will help increase the galactic

20:25.720 --> 20:26.720
readiness rating.

20:26.720 --> 20:27.720
All right.

20:27.720 --> 20:28.720
I was not aware of that.

20:28.720 --> 20:29.840
And Tiger Claw does say the app is free.

20:29.840 --> 20:30.840
Okay.

20:30.840 --> 20:31.840
That makes me feel a little better.

20:31.840 --> 20:35.800
I didn't know that up front, so I apologize.

20:35.800 --> 20:40.840
However, my point about the whole nickel and diming and you don't get to make your game

20:40.840 --> 20:45.400
a free-to-play Facebook game and charge 60 bucks for it point still stands.

20:45.400 --> 20:52.800
Like you're allowing people to buy a competitive edge when it leaves a very bad taste in my

20:52.800 --> 20:53.800
mouth.

20:53.800 --> 20:54.800
Yeah.

20:54.800 --> 20:57.080
Defend Mass Effect all you want.

20:57.080 --> 21:03.280
I still say it's a great game, great story, awesome characters, wonderful gameplay, but

21:03.280 --> 21:04.480
this is a shitty choice.

21:04.480 --> 21:05.480
All right.

21:05.480 --> 21:06.720
I'm looking at this app now.

21:06.720 --> 21:09.280
Take your galaxy with you wherever you go.

21:09.280 --> 21:10.280
Okay.

21:10.280 --> 21:13.640
You know, the galaxy is in Orion's ball.

21:13.640 --> 21:20.080
A City Vampire also says technically you could play the multiplayer by yourself to up the

21:20.080 --> 21:21.080
galactic readiness.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.080
Yeah.

21:22.080 --> 21:25.320
But I did two player, which is me and Shane yesterday.

21:25.320 --> 21:31.040
And we survived a wave three and we were really excited that we got that far.

21:31.040 --> 21:32.040
Yes.

21:32.040 --> 21:36.040
So I misquoted that it's the galaxy is in Orion's belt.

21:36.040 --> 21:37.640
It's been a while since I saw him in black.

21:37.640 --> 21:38.640
All right.

21:38.640 --> 21:42.000
So, so all that bitching aside, Mass Effect three is still going to be one of the year's

21:42.000 --> 21:43.240
best games.

21:43.240 --> 21:46.180
I just think I, I'm, I'm side IEA.

21:46.180 --> 21:47.440
I'm looking at UEA.

21:47.440 --> 21:48.840
This is a shitty choice.

21:48.840 --> 21:52.580
If game designers continue to go down this path, this is what's going to cause the next

21:52.580 --> 21:57.840
game crash watch this and the no use thing and everything.

21:57.840 --> 22:01.560
All these other money grabs gaming companies are trying to do in this economy is going

22:01.560 --> 22:02.560
to take it.

22:02.560 --> 22:03.560
This is money grabbing light.

22:03.560 --> 22:04.560
Okay.

22:04.560 --> 22:07.160
This is nothing compared to some of the crap that they're pulling right now.

22:07.160 --> 22:10.320
I mean, Skylanders, Skylanders.

22:10.320 --> 22:16.120
I'm telling you right there, that right there is seriously the tiny pebble that is rolling

22:16.120 --> 22:17.120
down the hill.

22:17.120 --> 22:21.840
That's going to, you know, turn into this giant snowball that will kill the industry.

22:21.840 --> 22:26.440
That right there, that one game, because it was successful because idiots bought these

22:26.440 --> 22:27.960
stupid toys.

22:27.960 --> 22:31.240
That is what's going to fucking ruin this industry and you think DLC is bad now.

22:31.240 --> 22:34.040
Oh, you have not seen anything yet.

22:34.040 --> 22:36.080
By the way, I downloaded the app.

22:36.080 --> 22:39.600
And I want to point out, you did just say in chat, the app has restored your desire

22:39.600 --> 22:40.600
to play it.

22:40.600 --> 22:43.160
Just to make that clear for listeners, knowing that there is a free option makes you feel

22:43.160 --> 22:44.160
a little better.

22:44.160 --> 22:49.040
Well, and on top of that too, I mean, I just started, I finished my first month of my job

22:49.040 --> 22:51.800
and I have two weeks left of school.

22:51.800 --> 22:55.380
So really I've had no concentration.

22:55.380 --> 22:57.560
What is this real life stuff I'm hearing?

22:57.560 --> 22:58.560
Excuse me.

22:58.560 --> 22:59.560
I'm just kidding.

22:59.560 --> 23:01.440
Video games are how to escape all that.

23:01.440 --> 23:03.440
Bitch please.

23:03.440 --> 23:09.000
When the job that you work requires your brain and then you have to use your brain some more,

23:09.000 --> 23:14.480
the brain does not have much juice left to think about multiplayer and, and shooting

23:14.480 --> 23:15.480
things.

23:15.480 --> 23:18.440
And I don't even ever want to play.

23:18.440 --> 23:19.440
Wow.

23:19.440 --> 23:20.440
So.

23:20.440 --> 23:21.440
All right.

23:21.440 --> 23:22.440
Anyhow.

23:22.440 --> 23:24.360
Um, that's it for my gaming week.

23:24.360 --> 23:25.360
Really massive victory.

23:25.360 --> 23:28.160
Oh no, I guess I should give one other little shout out quick, quick one guys.

23:28.160 --> 23:29.160
Quick one.

23:29.160 --> 23:30.160
And then we can get into the news.

23:30.160 --> 23:31.160
Um, I will say quickly.

23:31.160 --> 23:35.200
I watched a friend of mine last night play silent Hill downpour, which is the new silent

23:35.200 --> 23:36.200
Hill game.

23:36.200 --> 23:39.200
I went to a friend's house to watch and play it.

23:39.200 --> 23:40.200
It was all right.

23:40.200 --> 23:41.560
Like the graphics were really good.

23:41.560 --> 23:42.680
The graphics are really good.

23:42.680 --> 23:45.180
There were some things about it that made me laugh.

23:45.180 --> 23:50.140
Like in the very opening sequence, there's this guy you have to kill and like you stab

23:50.140 --> 23:53.080
him with a knife in the, in his back literally.

23:53.080 --> 23:55.440
And he's running around the room that you're in.

23:55.440 --> 23:59.460
And the way that he's running is so hilariously bad.

23:59.460 --> 24:04.600
You can't help but like face Palm and go, Oh God, Konami, what have you done?

24:04.600 --> 24:08.680
Uh, there's a lot of, I mean, I, you can't judge the whole game based off that one like

24:08.680 --> 24:13.600
silly part, you know, otherwise, and plus I didn't really spend quality time with it

24:13.600 --> 24:18.520
and I wasn't the one playing, but look and ambience aside, it is, it does seem like there's

24:18.520 --> 24:19.520
a lot, they got right.

24:19.520 --> 24:22.780
Like there were some, Oh shit moments, like there's a part where he's walking across this

24:22.780 --> 24:27.660
fallen tree that like, you know, he might fall at any minute and then he like a twig

24:27.660 --> 24:32.200
snaps off the tree and goes plummeting down, you know, cheap ass scares like that, that

24:32.200 --> 24:35.120
you come to love out of, you know, playing these scary video games.

24:35.120 --> 24:36.840
There are some cool little things like that.

24:36.840 --> 24:40.760
So I didn't play enough of the game to really tell you if it's worth it or not, but I will

24:40.760 --> 24:43.000
tell you, my friend seems to be enjoying it.

24:43.000 --> 24:48.640
You know, it's not silent Hill two or silent Hill three, but let's be real.

24:48.640 --> 24:53.740
It, nothing ever will be shit silent Hill two and three that just came out last month

24:53.740 --> 24:56.740
isn't silent Hill two and three anymore.

24:56.740 --> 25:01.960
So if you can let that go, I think this is a pretty decent game from what I understand.

25:01.960 --> 25:02.960
It actually did occur to me.

25:02.960 --> 25:07.320
There was some other gaming that went on at my house, Dan playing through, um, Gradius

25:07.320 --> 25:08.320
three.

25:08.320 --> 25:09.320
Yeah.

25:09.320 --> 25:13.840
And me failing miserably at our type, just saying.

25:13.840 --> 25:14.840
Sorry to hear that.

25:14.840 --> 25:18.240
Sorry to hear that just because I wanted to hear the level one music and then when I'm

25:18.240 --> 25:21.720
done with level one, it's kind of like, I don't want to play anymore.

25:21.720 --> 25:22.720
All right.

25:22.720 --> 25:26.060
Uh, go to our chat room at vog network.com if you want to join us as we are live on this

25:26.060 --> 25:31.920
Sunday evening as we will be every week from here on out at the vog network, vog network.com

25:31.920 --> 25:37.080
Uh, looking through some comments in chat, zither says, I heard the silent Hill HD collection

25:37.080 --> 25:38.080
sucks.

25:38.080 --> 25:39.080
Yeah.

25:39.080 --> 25:40.080
I heard that too.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.080
Uh, it did suck.

25:41.080 --> 25:44.520
Um, unfortunately like something about the, I mean, I haven't played it myself, but just

25:44.520 --> 25:46.320
what I'm reading isn't good.

25:46.320 --> 25:51.600
Apparently next gen consoles can't handle last gen fog.

25:51.600 --> 25:52.600
That's ridiculous.

25:52.600 --> 25:53.600
Downpour.

25:53.600 --> 25:56.560
I watched played on a PS three and it had plenty of fog.

25:56.560 --> 26:01.600
And here's the thing is if you can't render the fog, then why bother releasing the game?

26:01.600 --> 26:08.240
It's like if you can't create, uh, an emulator or whatever to run the old code, then don't

26:08.240 --> 26:09.480
do it.

26:09.480 --> 26:11.240
Just don't release a broken game.

26:11.240 --> 26:14.060
Uh, stand in our chat room asks, how was the music?

26:14.060 --> 26:18.120
Because as you know, Akira Yomoka is no longer with Konami, so he has nothing to do with

26:18.120 --> 26:21.360
these games now, which, you know, some say is, is the reason why they're, they're not

26:21.360 --> 26:22.360
so good anymore.

26:22.360 --> 26:25.740
Uh, the music was composed by, I think his name is Daniel Licht and he does the music

26:25.740 --> 26:26.740
for Dexter.

26:26.740 --> 26:32.160
Um, it, the, the parts that I heard again in my limited, uh, viewing was, um, decent

26:32.160 --> 26:33.160
enough.

26:33.160 --> 26:41.240
It was enough of a cop drama TV show mixed with some of the little themes, like the little,

26:41.240 --> 26:44.000
that little thing that you hear in the beginning, a little mandolin or whatever.

26:44.000 --> 26:47.120
Like it's, it's enough of those kind of mixed together as the elements.

26:47.120 --> 26:51.360
But again, if you're going to go into the game going, the music, I just know nothing

26:51.360 --> 26:52.800
is going to compare to Akira Yomoka.

26:52.800 --> 26:54.520
This game is never going to compare to Akira Yomoka.

26:54.520 --> 26:58.440
If you're not willing to take those blinders off and go, okay, it's a new game.

26:58.440 --> 26:59.920
Let's just deal with what it is.

26:59.920 --> 27:02.600
I think you're just going to set yourself up for disappointment.

27:02.600 --> 27:05.720
So just kind of want to throw that out there.

27:05.720 --> 27:11.040
Uh, Nietzsche in our chat room says, is the original Silent Hill still playable or is

27:11.040 --> 27:12.760
it painful to play through?

27:12.760 --> 27:14.760
Got a free copy through PlayStation Plus.

27:14.760 --> 27:17.160
Yeah, don't forget it is, is free on PlayStation Plus.

27:17.160 --> 27:18.560
I need to grab it myself.

27:18.560 --> 27:21.360
Um, that is a direct port of the PlayStation one game.

27:21.360 --> 27:24.340
So as I understand, everything should be fine.

27:24.340 --> 27:29.400
It's not going to be up rezzed or any of that stuff besides the very, very, very basic like

27:29.400 --> 27:33.520
texture smoothing and some of the things that the PlayStation three will do to PS one classics.

27:33.520 --> 27:37.520
Um, otherwise you're getting a pretty legitimate experience as long as you're willing to play

27:37.520 --> 27:42.260
a game with 1997 graphics, then you'll be all right.

27:42.260 --> 27:43.360
You know, just keep that in mind.

27:43.360 --> 27:46.160
It was the games getting to be almost 15 years old.

27:46.160 --> 27:49.640
So all right, um, that's it with our gaming weeks.

27:49.640 --> 27:52.680
Let's move on into some housekeeping.

27:52.680 --> 27:56.560
Of course you can still find us on Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R we are on Facebook

27:56.560 --> 27:57.560
as well.

27:57.560 --> 27:59.400
Facebook.com slash orange lounge.

27:59.400 --> 28:03.640
I do want to throw out there though, please follow our new network, the VOG networks.

28:03.640 --> 28:06.680
You can stay tuned to all the changes that are going on.

28:06.680 --> 28:10.680
Twitter.com slash VOG network is where you can follow the new network and it's also on

28:10.680 --> 28:14.280
Facebook, facebook.com slash VOG network.

28:14.280 --> 28:17.440
Orange lounge radio is also on Google plus search for us there.

28:17.440 --> 28:19.200
VOG's not there yet, but it will be.

28:19.200 --> 28:23.680
Um, and um, I think that's, I think that's it for all the plugs.

28:23.680 --> 28:25.640
Please help spread the word about the new network.

28:25.640 --> 28:26.720
We so can't wait.

28:26.720 --> 28:32.520
And I again really want to thank the folks at geek-life.com for all the work they did

28:32.520 --> 28:34.520
in promoting today's launch.

28:34.520 --> 28:37.300
Go visit their website and click on ads.

28:37.300 --> 28:38.480
It would go a long way.

28:38.480 --> 28:39.480
Thank you much.

28:39.480 --> 28:40.520
All right, let's move on.

28:40.520 --> 28:42.520
Let's um, get into some gaming news this week.

28:42.520 --> 28:43.520
Loki start off.

28:43.520 --> 28:52.680
So Sony is not one to be outdone by Nintendo in the form of, you know, uh, mascot character

28:52.680 --> 28:54.720
battle royale deathmatch or whatever.

28:54.720 --> 28:59.720
Um, so now they have the PlayStation all stars battle royale, which is coming to the PlayStation

28:59.720 --> 29:00.720
three.

29:00.720 --> 29:02.880
Uh, this year, I wish it was coming together.

29:02.880 --> 29:04.080
That'd be kind of cool.

29:04.080 --> 29:09.240
But um, it's being developed by super bot and it features characters from all sorts

29:09.240 --> 29:14.960
of different places and franchises, new and old, including, um, Parappa the rapper was

29:14.960 --> 29:15.960
in there.

29:15.960 --> 29:16.960
That was kind of cool.

29:16.960 --> 29:21.260
Um, Kratos, he did study Kung Fu punch.

29:21.260 --> 29:24.120
It's all in the mind and they actually took that into account.

29:24.120 --> 29:26.440
So he does have some Kung Fu moves that he uses.

29:26.440 --> 29:31.160
So well, he damn well better actually Parappa's lethal move is he gives you the most bitch

29:31.160 --> 29:34.440
and paper cut you've ever had in your life.

29:34.440 --> 29:35.440
That's what he does.

29:35.440 --> 29:42.760
Uh, but of course, you know, the Sly Cooper is in there, um, fat princess, um, and also,

29:42.760 --> 29:47.800
you know, some other characters that are mentioning that, you know, obviously Cole from Infamous

29:47.800 --> 29:51.060
is probably going to be in there and they're going to have some characters from resistance

29:51.060 --> 29:53.560
and all sorts of different things.

29:53.560 --> 29:59.200
Um, and it looks extremely like, you know, I'm trying to think of other big Sony products

29:59.200 --> 30:03.360
so they could bring in this game, obviously, uh, absolute, uh, the cart, little cart dudes

30:03.360 --> 30:04.560
from ModNation racers.

30:04.560 --> 30:05.560
Um, maybe.

30:05.560 --> 30:06.560
I don't know.

30:06.560 --> 30:07.760
I don't think about the cast of the tester.

30:07.760 --> 30:11.520
Should we call Oscar to see if they did any sweet tooth was going to be in there.

30:11.520 --> 30:16.320
Um, now one of the things I did like about, um, the game that they kind of showed in the

30:16.320 --> 30:21.200
trailers since this whole thing is kind of like this matte mashup thing they have like

30:21.200 --> 30:25.640
in the background, kind of like two different worlds clashing at the same time.

30:25.640 --> 30:30.280
So like for example, they'll have, um, uh, it was actually really cool.

30:30.280 --> 30:31.760
They had, I think one of the demons.

30:31.760 --> 30:38.440
I want Hades from, um, God of war was actually attacking, um, the Pat upon.

30:38.440 --> 30:39.520
So that was kind of cool.

30:39.520 --> 30:41.020
They had that kind of going on there.

30:41.020 --> 30:47.240
There was one I saw, it was little big planets world kind of, um, crossed with, uh, what

30:47.240 --> 30:52.640
the fuck is their dam, uh, buzz, the, the buzz game, like the quiz show thing.

30:52.640 --> 30:53.640
Oh yeah.

30:53.640 --> 30:54.640
Buzz.

30:54.640 --> 30:55.640
Yeah.

30:55.640 --> 30:56.640
So a host dude.

30:56.640 --> 30:57.640
Yeah.

30:57.640 --> 30:59.480
So I'm wondering if he's a character or something, but, uh, it was interesting, but the gameplay

30:59.480 --> 31:02.400
itself looks exactly like smash brothers.

31:02.400 --> 31:03.400
Exactly like smash brothers.

31:03.400 --> 31:08.560
Have the, have the creators addressed that gigantic pink elephant in the room that, Hey,

31:08.560 --> 31:10.600
your game looks really damn familiar.

31:10.600 --> 31:13.360
I think I've seen this somewhere before.

31:13.360 --> 31:14.360
No.

31:14.360 --> 31:19.960
Um, it doesn't seem like they have, I mean, it's going to play a little bit different,

31:19.960 --> 31:21.800
but damn, does it look like smash brothers?

31:21.800 --> 31:23.320
Well, here, here's the question.

31:23.320 --> 31:29.440
I mean, is it okay what they're doing because you know, I kind of go, well, they're, they're

31:29.440 --> 31:34.120
there's several different basketball games that come out and there's all these dance

31:34.120 --> 31:35.120
games.

31:35.120 --> 31:36.120
It's just like fighting games.

31:36.120 --> 31:39.400
I mean, all the fighting games, I mean, are pretty similar, right?

31:39.400 --> 31:44.440
So there's, I think enough different with it that it'll be, you know, its own thing,

31:44.440 --> 31:46.200
but I don't know.

31:46.200 --> 31:49.080
It's just, it, it obviously it's getting one of the things that people are gonna think

31:49.080 --> 31:50.960
of him as like, wow, this really looks like smashers.

31:50.960 --> 31:52.280
No, that could be good or bad.

31:52.280 --> 31:53.280
I don't know.

31:53.280 --> 31:58.720
So did people, you know, call out smash brothers for being like, you know, for having the four

31:58.720 --> 32:00.200
player thing like power stone.

32:00.200 --> 32:03.840
I mean, even the power stone was, you know, full layout.

32:03.840 --> 32:10.640
It was, you know, and not the, the semi 2d, um, zither in the chat room says Nintendo

32:10.640 --> 32:16.480
should Sue, but Ross TLUT in our chat room at vognetwork.com follows that up with well,

32:16.480 --> 32:22.020
but hold on because you know, um, smash brothers wasn't really the first game to do it either.

32:22.020 --> 32:27.800
And links to a game called the out foxies, which I don't remember this game at all, but

32:27.800 --> 32:31.720
certainly, you know, certainly there's probably older games in the past that were similar.

32:31.720 --> 32:34.960
I remember playing one on the DS that was very similar.

32:34.960 --> 32:38.960
I guess that would be after smash brothers in the 64 that was a, the top Trump's or not

32:38.960 --> 32:39.960
top Trump's.

32:39.960 --> 32:45.580
It's a, the, it was all the, um, it was like, yeah, it was like, uh, yeah, like snake from

32:45.580 --> 32:49.480
metal gear was in it and all this, I played it at a comic convention once there was a

32:49.480 --> 32:50.480
game on the DS.

32:50.480 --> 32:54.580
It was total like, just like it and it, it existed and I'm looking at, it was a shonen

32:54.580 --> 32:55.580
jump game.

32:55.580 --> 32:56.580
That's what it was.

32:56.580 --> 32:57.840
It was something really boring.

32:57.840 --> 32:59.400
Uh, no Trump's is a card game.

32:59.400 --> 33:01.560
I understand that, but it was shown in jump.

33:01.560 --> 33:07.720
Uh, it was their game that they had, uh, Bob coffee in our term says smash for N 64 came

33:07.720 --> 33:09.080
out before power stone.

33:09.080 --> 33:10.640
If I recall, that is true.

33:10.640 --> 33:11.640
That is true.

33:11.640 --> 33:16.120
Jump and power, power stone actually was full on 3d rotational, everything.

33:16.120 --> 33:19.640
Uh, several folks in our chat room, all jumping in there, jump all stars is the game I'm trying

33:19.640 --> 33:20.640
to think of.

33:20.640 --> 33:21.640
Yeah.

33:21.640 --> 33:22.640
So you know, this type of thing.

33:22.640 --> 33:24.800
And there was the Ninja turtles game on game cube.

33:24.800 --> 33:30.160
There's been some other kind of inspired, heavily inspired, shall we say by smash brothers?

33:30.160 --> 33:36.640
I got to say as much as I kind of chuckle at this game being, you know, heavily inspired,

33:36.640 --> 33:39.280
shall we say about what Nintendo's got going on?

33:39.280 --> 33:40.660
I want to play it.

33:40.660 --> 33:42.240
It looks pretty cool.

33:42.240 --> 33:48.080
I love the fact that it'll be HD and it's going to get online, right?

33:48.080 --> 33:49.080
That's one place.

33:49.080 --> 33:54.360
I mean, I guess smash brothers, you know, melee did as well as it could with the online,

33:54.360 --> 33:57.800
but I'm, I'm thinking that this has got to be coming out for the, uh, the Vita.

33:57.800 --> 34:03.040
I mean, it would be, I would think it would be a mistake not to put it on the Vita, especially

34:03.040 --> 34:07.680
it's, it's something, although, although, um, maybe the reason it's not coming on the

34:07.680 --> 34:11.280
Vita is because they really have issues with doing network play.

34:11.280 --> 34:16.640
You know, it's like, well, well you can do it via wifi or you can do this asynchronous

34:16.640 --> 34:18.000
multiplayer bullshit.

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
Doesn't street fighter cross Tekken, isn't that going to be PS3 and Vita?

34:21.000 --> 34:27.240
Like you can, well, it is going to be, yeah, but I mean, you know, Capcom's had more experience

34:27.240 --> 34:29.240
working on the PlayStation three.

34:29.240 --> 34:32.520
That's why they couldn't, you know, add certain features to the Xbox version.

34:32.520 --> 34:35.760
Shadow next gen in our chat says, sky, this is a PS3 game.

34:35.760 --> 34:38.920
There's no guarantee that online will be done right.

34:38.920 --> 34:43.400
That may be true, but I'm sorry I give Sony more credit than I give Nintendo when it comes

34:43.400 --> 34:44.400
to doing online, right?

34:44.400 --> 34:47.960
Yeah, I would trust them with online better than granted.

34:47.960 --> 34:50.960
Smash Brothers Melee probably did a hell of a lot better than any other Nintendo game

34:50.960 --> 34:55.600
before it, as far as online goes, but keep in mind, Nintendo had that whole friend code

34:55.600 --> 34:59.600
garbage you had to work with, you know, so that didn't make anything fun.

34:59.600 --> 35:02.940
So, um, all right.

35:02.940 --> 35:06.960
So anyhow, again, if you want to join our chat room, vog network.com, meanwhile, let's

35:06.960 --> 35:08.400
go to some other gaming news.

35:08.400 --> 35:14.600
Uh, this is a little bit of a surprise or, and it's not because it's always about patents.

35:14.600 --> 35:19.200
You know, patent, I get the sense that patent laws in this country are, are going to be

35:19.200 --> 35:23.520
headed somewhere different soon, especially you hear, there's just so much in the news

35:23.520 --> 35:24.520
about like what?

35:24.520 --> 35:26.240
Twitter was a Twitter.

35:26.240 --> 35:30.900
So one of them acquired all these patents and said that they're only using them defensively.

35:30.900 --> 35:33.960
They don't plan to use ever like sue for patent or whatever.

35:33.960 --> 35:38.920
And then you have Facebook suing Yahoo and Yahoo suing Facebook and all this stuff over

35:38.920 --> 35:39.920
patents.

35:39.920 --> 35:44.400
I mean the, the money that's getting sucked away into all this is just amazing.

35:44.400 --> 35:48.320
And here we have another result of the whole patent warfare.

35:48.320 --> 35:54.680
The Xbox 360 has been found infringing on four patents that were owned by Motorola.

35:54.680 --> 36:00.520
Uh, according to the website, the verge, the patents that were in question deal with the

36:00.520 --> 36:06.960
video codec, the H two 64, um, that is also going on with some other legal proceedings

36:06.960 --> 36:09.280
with Microsoft and Motorola right now.

36:09.280 --> 36:12.060
The other two are about wifi technology.

36:12.060 --> 36:16.960
There's also a fifth patent about communication between the Xbox and its accessories.

36:16.960 --> 36:22.200
However, one of the wifi patents was found not infringed and one claim regarding one

36:22.200 --> 36:27.960
of the video patents was invalid, but some were found to be valid.

36:27.960 --> 36:34.560
So Microsoft is seeking to force a Motorola to license its standard patents under more

36:34.560 --> 36:40.400
fair and reasonable terms, but this original ruling by the judge is a bit of a blow on

36:40.400 --> 36:42.040
Microsoft's efforts.

36:42.040 --> 36:47.160
However, as most things in the legal system appeal, appeal, appeal, and the appeal step

36:47.160 --> 36:48.160
is a panel of six judges.

36:48.160 --> 36:52.600
I want to say that they're also suing, I want to say that they're suing Apple too.

36:52.600 --> 36:57.560
It, um, it was some other big company, um, that Motorola was going after.

36:57.560 --> 37:04.680
I want to say, I think it was Apple when Zethur and Motorola used to make Apple's processors.

37:04.680 --> 37:07.280
All the tech companies have helped each other and then stab each other in the back.

37:07.280 --> 37:08.280
It's it's, it's crazy.

37:08.280 --> 37:11.120
Zethur in her terms is patent trolling.

37:11.120 --> 37:16.240
Basically I reserve the term patent troll for a company that exists to do nothing but

37:16.240 --> 37:17.240
this.

37:17.240 --> 37:23.440
Um, and, but you're talking Motorola and Microsoft, you know, they're both really big companies.

37:23.440 --> 37:24.880
Motorola makes lots of phones.

37:24.880 --> 37:27.360
I don't know if I call them a patent troll.

37:27.360 --> 37:29.340
This is just patent warfare.

37:29.340 --> 37:34.800
This is very similar to what you see going on with Yahoo and Facebook.

37:34.800 --> 37:38.000
You know, Yahoo hasn't been doing so well lately because you know, back in the early

37:38.000 --> 37:40.920
days of the web, Yahoo was kind of like the king of search engines.

37:40.920 --> 37:45.240
It was a big directory everybody used and uh, you know, they, they, they've survived.

37:45.240 --> 37:46.240
They kept up with water.

37:46.240 --> 37:49.680
And it is Apple by the way, they've tried to become a bit of a portal.

37:49.680 --> 37:54.160
They have their Yahoo mail, but they haven't really been able to like break through like,

37:54.160 --> 37:56.440
you know, Google kind of stomped on it and so forth.

37:56.440 --> 37:58.080
I still use Yahoo here and there.

37:58.080 --> 38:02.480
They're a good portal, but they're struggling and they've had to lay a lot of people off.

38:02.480 --> 38:03.680
So what did Yahoo do?

38:03.680 --> 38:08.760
They sued Facebook over 10 patents that Yahoo had and a lot of it tied into, I think the

38:08.760 --> 38:13.560
my Yahoo that they tried to develop that has a lot of aggregate feed type stuff that Facebook

38:13.560 --> 38:15.880
also does to kind of put it in a nutshell.

38:15.880 --> 38:18.360
Um, so what did Facebook do in return?

38:18.360 --> 38:21.040
Sued Yahoo right back over other patents.

38:21.040 --> 38:22.820
That's just patent warfare.

38:22.820 --> 38:26.760
And that is, I don't want to say it's patent trolling, but it's clear that Yahoo struggling

38:26.760 --> 38:31.920
and this is something that they're doing to try and kind of get themselves back up a little

38:31.920 --> 38:32.920
bit.

38:32.920 --> 38:34.760
Or maybe just try to stay relevant.

38:34.760 --> 38:35.760
In a way maybe.

38:35.760 --> 38:42.960
Well, um, I found the, the other one and actually it is Apple, um, that's for a patent for noise

38:42.960 --> 38:47.200
elimination and other interference during voice and data transmission.

38:47.200 --> 38:52.480
So now does this mean the Xbox 360 is going to suddenly stop being sold?

38:52.480 --> 38:53.960
I kind of doubt that.

38:53.960 --> 38:58.360
Um, it's gone a little far this at this point, but could Microsoft end up having to pay huge

38:58.360 --> 39:00.120
amounts of money to Motorola?

39:00.120 --> 39:04.120
Could they have to, you know, agree to some pretty hefty terms for the technology?

39:04.120 --> 39:05.840
Yeah, it's possible.

39:05.840 --> 39:10.400
Could they perhaps not put rumble in their next console because it's not really that

39:10.400 --> 39:11.400
important anyways.

39:11.400 --> 39:13.560
It has nothing to do with the fact that they infringed on the patent.

39:13.560 --> 39:14.560
Oh, remember all that?

39:14.560 --> 39:15.680
Yeah, that's a great comparison.

39:15.680 --> 39:16.680
Remember that?

39:16.680 --> 39:18.680
That's why you didn't have rumble in the original PlayStation 3.

39:18.680 --> 39:20.840
No, it wasn't because they were infringing on patents.

39:20.840 --> 39:23.880
It's because it wasn't important until they decided to put it in there.

39:23.880 --> 39:24.880
Sure, sure.

39:24.880 --> 39:25.880
Whatever.

39:25.880 --> 39:26.880
That's exactly what it is.

39:26.880 --> 39:28.960
Not the fact that they got sued over the PlayStation 2 controllers.

39:28.960 --> 39:31.360
No, it was just, it wasn't important right then.

39:31.360 --> 39:33.680
It just, it became important later.

39:33.680 --> 39:35.560
Sixaxis was the future of gaming.

39:35.560 --> 39:39.840
What was the last game that used Sixaxis?

39:39.840 --> 39:41.640
Sixaxis was a pain in the ass.

39:41.640 --> 39:46.560
I know the last thing that I played that included it was Marvel Ultimate Alliance.

39:46.560 --> 39:47.560
I think that was it.

39:47.560 --> 39:48.560
That game's a few years old.

39:48.560 --> 39:52.240
I think there's still some games that use it, but man, it's not something that they're

39:52.240 --> 39:53.240
like, hey!

39:53.240 --> 39:56.640
Little Big Planet is one of the last ones I can think of that uses it.

39:56.640 --> 39:59.080
Um, yeah.

39:59.080 --> 40:00.080
Sixaxis.

40:00.080 --> 40:03.240
You can use it as a steering wheel, right?

40:03.240 --> 40:05.480
Yeah, it works, works great too.

40:05.480 --> 40:06.480
Awesome.

40:06.480 --> 40:08.200
Actually, that's why I still have a negcon.

40:08.200 --> 40:10.120
I will say, actually, I thought of it.

40:10.120 --> 40:15.800
I will, there is a Sixaxis game that was pretty bitchin', Flower.

40:15.800 --> 40:19.160
That's like the only Sixaxis game I can sit here and say I truly enjoyed it.

40:19.160 --> 40:24.480
I can use it to slightly adjust the camera in Journey.

40:24.480 --> 40:27.640
Moving on with more news.

40:27.640 --> 40:31.160
How about something that doesn't have to do with a really crappy controller?

40:31.160 --> 40:32.160
How about it?

40:32.160 --> 40:35.080
I got some Call of Duty.

40:35.080 --> 40:36.080
How about it?

40:36.080 --> 40:37.080
Bang, bang, bang.

40:37.080 --> 40:41.880
Well, um, the release date for Call of Duty Black Ops 2 has been leaked.

40:41.880 --> 40:44.440
Which I don't know if it was on purpose or not.

40:44.440 --> 40:48.920
I love when they say leaked, but you don't really know.

40:48.920 --> 40:49.920
Anyway.

40:49.920 --> 40:57.100
Um, so there was an image of the PS3 and Xbox 360 pre-order cards for Target.

40:57.100 --> 40:59.600
And it was posted by IGN earlier.

40:59.600 --> 41:03.680
It says it's gonna be on November 13th.

41:03.680 --> 41:06.560
So we have a shake of the head.

41:06.560 --> 41:07.560
Loki?

41:07.560 --> 41:08.560
I think they're guessing.

41:08.560 --> 41:10.320
Nothing's been announced.

41:10.320 --> 41:13.020
They're seriously guessing because I don't even think the game's gonna be called Black

41:13.020 --> 41:14.720
Ops 2 to be honest.

41:14.720 --> 41:20.680
Um, because they've registered trademarks for Call of Duty Eclipse.

41:20.680 --> 41:25.560
And they're guessing because already in blogs, like Kotaku and some other places, they've

41:25.560 --> 41:30.600
speculated that it's gonna be on the 13th because there happens to be a full lunar eclipse

41:30.600 --> 41:34.720
or solar eclipse actually on that date.

41:34.720 --> 41:37.160
Which also happens to fall on a Tuesday during November.

41:37.160 --> 41:41.920
There's a fucking election, presidential election happening the same day as the Halo release

41:41.920 --> 41:42.920
date.

41:42.920 --> 41:43.920
Well, to continue.

41:43.920 --> 41:44.920
Solar eclipses don't matter.

41:44.920 --> 41:49.640
There was indication first of a Black Ops sequel with an Amazon France listing that

41:49.640 --> 41:50.640
got pulled.

41:50.640 --> 41:55.680
Um, but there's supposed to be actual news coming out on this on May 1st.

41:55.680 --> 42:00.560
And the other reason I call bullshit on this too is because they, Call of Duty, they're

42:00.560 --> 42:08.780
using like, was it, like the Roman numerals for Black Ops 2 when, you know, it's most

42:08.780 --> 42:14.440
likely they normally just use like actual, you know, numbers for their titles.

42:14.440 --> 42:16.000
I just don't think it's gonna be Black Ops.

42:16.000 --> 42:17.800
I think that they're just guessing.

42:17.800 --> 42:24.200
And what's it really gonna hurt if they have, you know, um, some sort of, you know, pre-order

42:24.200 --> 42:27.040
card or whatever to get people excited about a new Call of Duty game?

42:27.040 --> 42:31.080
I mean, so what, if it ends up being something else, they'll just have to reprint cards.

42:31.080 --> 42:34.100
But I mean, we're gonna find out soon enough.

42:34.100 --> 42:35.100
It's just not.

42:35.100 --> 42:39.160
If they've got a card dated with it though, and this is just, if you think about the cost

42:39.160 --> 42:43.200
of printing and on a national scale.

42:43.200 --> 42:44.200
But I mean, this isn't.

42:44.200 --> 42:45.200
Wait, wait a minute.

42:45.200 --> 42:46.200
Wait a minute.

42:46.200 --> 42:50.800
If a target would just put a release date in their system and then put these fake things

42:50.800 --> 42:53.080
on the shelves to entice people to pre-order.

42:53.080 --> 42:56.560
I've never heard of that done before in the gaming retail industry.

42:56.560 --> 43:01.040
And it's not like that big major changes have not been wrong, you know, in printed marking

43:01.040 --> 43:02.040
material.

43:02.040 --> 43:03.040
Like for example.

43:03.040 --> 43:04.040
It doesn't really matter.

43:04.040 --> 43:08.120
According to Best Buy, you know, shit Diablo 3 should have been out months ago.

43:08.120 --> 43:09.120
I mean.

43:09.120 --> 43:10.120
Wait a minute.

43:10.120 --> 43:12.240
That was one Best Buy in like Wisconsin or something.

43:12.240 --> 43:16.240
And the whole thing, it doesn't really matter because they're making announcement on it

43:16.240 --> 43:18.080
in three days.

43:18.080 --> 43:20.280
So again, does it matter?

43:20.280 --> 43:21.280
No.

43:21.280 --> 43:22.280
It's, but it's all about firsties.

43:22.280 --> 43:24.520
It's all about who did it first, who called it first.

43:24.520 --> 43:26.960
And because, you know, that's why we have the whole patent wars.

43:26.960 --> 43:30.040
And that's a pile of who gives a shit.

43:30.040 --> 43:31.040
Yeah.

43:31.040 --> 43:38.400
That's so that all these websites can go exclusive, exclusive release date, at least exclusive

43:38.400 --> 43:42.400
pictures of the exclusive, exclusiving exclusive that we have.

43:42.400 --> 43:44.880
You know what an actual exclusive is?

43:44.880 --> 43:52.020
Is if the company went to, Hey, Hey, IGN, we want you to have the date officially from

43:52.020 --> 43:53.400
us.

43:53.400 --> 43:54.840
That's an exclusive.

43:54.840 --> 43:58.400
Getting it off of a, you know, a card from a target.

43:58.400 --> 44:01.840
You mean like certain radio entrepreneurs may have gone to a geeky website to give them

44:01.840 --> 44:03.360
the exclusive on what was happening?

44:03.360 --> 44:04.360
Exactly.

44:04.360 --> 44:08.320
When they come to you and say, we want you to do it first because you've been good

44:08.320 --> 44:09.440
to us.

44:09.440 --> 44:16.280
But if I use the word exclusive as much as exclusively possible in my article, then I'll

44:16.280 --> 44:26.040
get more hits and I'll get to go to E3 because that's what this industry has turned into.

44:26.040 --> 44:31.480
Exclusive Jamie Shuttermouth for the first time here on Orange Lounge Radio.

44:31.480 --> 44:33.200
That's a Rob Roberts exclusive.

44:33.200 --> 44:36.240
Actions speak louder than words and none of you can see this action.

44:36.240 --> 44:37.520
And I'm getting the finger.

44:37.520 --> 44:39.480
I mean, yeah, it's a good guess.

44:39.480 --> 44:44.840
I mean, obviously they're not going to launch the same day as Halo and it's typically the

44:44.840 --> 44:51.440
second second Tuesday of November that they normally launch Call of Duty.

44:51.440 --> 44:56.800
So I mean, it's a good guess and they could be right.

44:56.800 --> 44:58.560
I was not purring.

44:58.560 --> 45:03.200
I mean, it's only like what, you know, one in four shot of being correct.

45:03.200 --> 45:08.360
So yeah, and actually one in two because I mean it's going to be in the beginning of

45:08.360 --> 45:09.360
the month.

45:09.360 --> 45:13.160
They might have to recall all those cards or in the great retail big box way.

45:13.160 --> 45:14.160
Get a bunch.

45:14.160 --> 45:16.320
Get a big black marker.

45:16.320 --> 45:17.320
Get the new guy.

45:17.320 --> 45:18.320
Hey, new guy.

45:18.320 --> 45:23.200
Take this giant stack of 500 cards and you take this Sharpie and everywhere you see a

45:23.200 --> 45:27.200
13 you're going to write a 20.

45:27.200 --> 45:28.200
You think you can do that?

45:28.200 --> 45:29.940
When do I get my break?

45:29.940 --> 45:32.720
That's not how it works.

45:32.720 --> 45:37.080
You didn't have to pay that guy more to be honest for the time that would take him to

45:37.080 --> 45:38.080
do all that.

45:38.080 --> 45:41.640
Then it would just be to print up 50,000 new cards.

45:41.640 --> 45:43.800
Can I, can I go on a tangent?

45:43.800 --> 45:45.800
I want a vog tangent.

45:45.800 --> 45:48.920
I want our first vog tangent.

45:48.920 --> 45:50.440
We already had one of those, Rob.

45:50.440 --> 45:51.440
I went grocery.

45:51.440 --> 45:52.440
It was okra.

45:52.440 --> 45:54.640
I went grocery shopping with Alan yesterday.

45:54.640 --> 45:56.400
We went to the grocery store.

45:56.400 --> 45:57.780
I know, right?

45:57.780 --> 45:58.960
I know, right?

45:58.960 --> 45:59.960
So we went to the grocery store.

45:59.960 --> 46:00.960
Exclusive.

46:00.960 --> 46:10.280
And we bought probably like, I don't know, $120 worth of groceries, but thanks to couponing

46:10.280 --> 46:12.960
I got it down to 115.

46:12.960 --> 46:13.960
But anyway.

46:13.960 --> 46:14.960
How very Dutch of you.

46:14.960 --> 46:20.360
The point is, well it is in my heritage, but anyway, we get the cart, you know how you

46:20.360 --> 46:24.080
take the cart up to the little thing and you put everything up on the conveyor belt, right?

46:24.080 --> 46:29.900
One of the employees was standing there waiting for us to put the cart and they actually took

46:29.900 --> 46:32.600
everything out of the cart and put it on the conveyor belt.

46:32.600 --> 46:35.240
And I was thinking, they don't ever do that for you.

46:35.240 --> 46:39.580
You always, why are the employees, they have one person bagging, they have one at the register,

46:39.580 --> 46:43.120
and now this chick is just loading the groceries on the conveyor belt for me.

46:43.120 --> 46:47.340
I mean, not that I'm going to complain, but it does kind of make me go, gosh, I feel really

46:47.340 --> 46:48.340
fucking lazy.

46:48.340 --> 46:51.880
And I'm like, is everybody else in the grocery store just watching this poor grocery clerk

46:51.880 --> 46:52.880
like do this for me?

46:52.880 --> 46:57.000
And like, if I was in a wheelchair or had a cast on or something, I could understand

46:57.000 --> 46:58.000
why they do that.

46:58.000 --> 47:06.000
But Alan and I are both perfectly healthy individuals, you know, Rob and Alan are healthy.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.000
Yet she was doing it.

47:07.000 --> 47:11.160
So I was like, um, well, thank you for loading the groceries on the conveyor belt.

47:11.160 --> 47:13.400
What so whatever do we owe this?

47:13.400 --> 47:14.520
Like I don't usually see us.

47:14.520 --> 47:18.480
And she said, well, we're really overstaffed right now.

47:18.480 --> 47:21.040
We have a lot of new people that just started today.

47:21.040 --> 47:22.480
So we have so many people.

47:22.480 --> 47:24.280
She's like, I was just, I was just here.

47:24.280 --> 47:26.440
I needed something to do.

47:26.440 --> 47:30.440
And she's like, I spent all morning in the produce department just arranging things.

47:30.440 --> 47:35.840
And I'm thinking to myself inappropriately, I'm thinking to myself, apples and bananas.

47:35.840 --> 47:39.920
As much as I appreciate that she has a job, she has good employment.

47:39.920 --> 47:42.600
So that offers union.

47:42.600 --> 47:44.280
See if she wants to go home.

47:44.280 --> 47:45.280
She's union.

47:45.280 --> 47:46.280
What is that?

47:46.280 --> 47:47.440
Is that a union thing?

47:47.440 --> 47:49.360
I didn't even think of that, but you're probably right.

47:49.360 --> 47:50.360
I worked.

47:50.360 --> 47:53.720
Keep in mind, I worked for a grocery store for all of three freaking days and I quit

47:53.720 --> 47:57.720
after the old man tried to be a bitch to me and I told him he couldn't buy his beer.

47:57.720 --> 48:03.560
I haven't said that story on the air, have I, but I know that like you had, you were,

48:03.560 --> 48:07.180
you got guaranteed certain number of hours and you got guaranteed this.

48:07.180 --> 48:13.040
And like you, if you were scheduled to work, you had to work and this crap, um, a sitting

48:13.040 --> 48:16.240
vampire in chat says that's like someone pumping your gas.

48:16.240 --> 48:17.240
It did.

48:17.240 --> 48:18.240
It did.

48:18.240 --> 48:19.240
Oregon.

48:19.240 --> 48:20.240
It did feel very Jersey or Oregon.

48:20.240 --> 48:21.240
Take your pick.

48:21.240 --> 48:25.400
Um, I have to tell you one thing, and this just goes from my childhood and visiting my

48:25.400 --> 48:31.680
granny in Dothan, Alabama, that we would go to the Piggly Wiggly.

48:31.680 --> 48:34.960
I know the best name for a grocery store ever.

48:34.960 --> 48:38.000
And I'm going to go get pork at the Piggly Wiggly.

48:38.000 --> 48:44.640
And they had, um, these type of conveyor belts that your, um, the back end of your, uh, buggy

48:44.640 --> 48:50.080
would unlatch and it would push right up to the belt and then the cashier would unload

48:50.080 --> 48:51.080
for you.

48:51.080 --> 48:52.080
They used to have those here too.

48:52.080 --> 48:56.160
They were those kind of tall, flat, flatter type of buggies.

48:56.160 --> 48:59.240
Some of the old railies here still had that where you just push, you don't even have a

48:59.240 --> 49:00.240
conveyor belt.

49:00.240 --> 49:02.880
You push the cart right up to the counter and then they open the front of it and just

49:02.880 --> 49:04.600
pull everything off of it and go over the standard.

49:04.600 --> 49:05.600
Which I think is great.

49:05.600 --> 49:06.600
Yeah, I do too.

49:06.600 --> 49:13.160
I mean, but now it's, you know, I also hate self service.

49:13.160 --> 49:18.520
Uh, and then, well yeah, I was going to say, uh, Ross Deal UT in our VOG chat room says

49:18.520 --> 49:21.160
here in Florida, we got Winn Dixie's with the self checkout counters.

49:21.160 --> 49:22.160
Yeah, we have that too.

49:22.160 --> 49:27.320
But when you're buying like $120 worth of groceries, I don't want to use the self.

49:27.320 --> 49:28.960
Those things are a pain in the ass.

49:28.960 --> 49:31.280
Old school Winn Dixie's by the way, had the old style thing too.

49:31.280 --> 49:35.560
The self checkouts are great for like when, you know, you need just a pint of ice cream

49:35.560 --> 49:41.900
and Doritos, but like when you're buying legit groceries for the week with produce and everything,

49:41.900 --> 49:45.680
like you don't, I know I would not use the self checkout, it would take forever.

49:45.680 --> 49:47.480
I have an expert do it.

49:47.480 --> 49:48.480
Anyhow.

49:48.480 --> 49:49.480
Wow.

49:49.480 --> 49:52.480
Everyone's talking about what their grocery stores are.

49:52.480 --> 49:53.480
I know.

49:53.480 --> 49:56.440
So this is, this is the most the chat was talked about all night.

49:56.440 --> 49:58.320
Perhaps we should become a grocery store podcast.

49:58.320 --> 50:02.480
Uh, Nietzsche in our chat says here in Kansas, your groceries are always bagged and sometimes

50:02.480 --> 50:03.520
carried to your vehicle.

50:03.520 --> 50:04.520
No questions asked.

50:04.520 --> 50:05.960
Raley's here does that.

50:05.960 --> 50:09.240
Well, they always ask, but I'm always like, no, no, no, no, but the thing is they're required

50:09.240 --> 50:10.240
to do it.

50:10.240 --> 50:11.240
It's part of their job.

50:11.240 --> 50:12.240
Really?

50:12.240 --> 50:13.240
Yeah, it is.

50:13.240 --> 50:14.240
So Dan and I have them do it.

50:14.240 --> 50:15.800
Again, if I'm buying ice cream and Doritos, I don't want to help out.

50:15.800 --> 50:17.760
If you're buying two things, that's one thing.

50:17.760 --> 50:21.560
But like if you're, if you're getting like all your groceries for the week or for the

50:21.560 --> 50:24.520
month or whatever, then it's, you know, it's kind of nice.

50:24.520 --> 50:25.520
It's part of their job.

50:25.520 --> 50:27.280
It's what they're supposed to do.

50:27.280 --> 50:32.320
And it, you know, honestly, we asked one of them flat out is like, do you really mind

50:32.320 --> 50:33.320
doing this?

50:33.320 --> 50:35.080
I like, I like getting out and getting some air.

50:35.080 --> 50:37.880
Hey, I want all those grapes individually bagged.

50:37.880 --> 50:42.960
I need you to go through this bag of M&Ms and pick out the green ones.

50:42.960 --> 50:47.920
Now, um, DJ Morpheus in chat is saying that's the Rob Roberts diet, ice cream and Doritos.

50:47.920 --> 50:49.240
I think that's your family crest.

50:49.240 --> 50:54.280
It's a big bag of Doritos with big, might well be pulps of ice cream coming out of the

50:54.280 --> 51:03.760
top of it and like, um, hello kitty over the bag of Doritos and, uh, the, uh, word, a penis

51:03.760 --> 51:04.760
or something.

51:04.760 --> 51:06.400
I don't know.

51:06.400 --> 51:14.280
Well, so, uh, in great, uh, internet fashion, we have apparently dropped this for the podcast

51:14.280 --> 51:15.280
listeners.

51:15.280 --> 51:16.520
We're trying to reconnect to the feed right now.

51:16.520 --> 51:18.640
I hope this isn't a repeat of what happened last week.

51:18.640 --> 51:21.880
That would be most unfortunate, but I don't think Comcast does anything.

51:21.880 --> 51:24.000
It is trying to reconnect right now and there it is.

51:24.000 --> 51:25.000
It reconnected.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.760
Apparently I just watched the bandwidth guys.

51:27.760 --> 51:30.440
If you have anything else going on, I just have to get that out there.

51:30.440 --> 51:33.080
I know, but these things happen.

51:33.080 --> 51:35.360
So yeah, I agree with game guru.

51:35.360 --> 51:37.400
If I get so popular, everyone is crashing.

51:37.400 --> 51:38.640
We'll just go with that.

51:38.640 --> 51:39.640
You guys are just crashing.

51:39.640 --> 51:40.640
Grocery lounge radio.

51:40.640 --> 51:41.640
All right.

51:41.640 --> 51:42.640
Anyhow.

51:42.640 --> 51:43.640
Yeah.

51:43.640 --> 51:44.640
You are the general manager.

51:44.640 --> 51:45.640
All right.

51:45.640 --> 51:46.640
Can we move on with more news?

51:46.640 --> 51:47.640
I don't know how I got on that tangent.

51:47.640 --> 51:49.120
I don't even know what that had to do with anything.

51:49.120 --> 51:52.560
Oh, because you were talking about the guy with the pen who would get paid too much to

51:52.560 --> 51:53.560
do that.

51:53.560 --> 51:54.960
And I'm like, they pay people to do crazy stuff.

51:54.960 --> 52:01.400
Like the chick who put my stuff on the conveyor belt, like I like mass effect.

52:01.400 --> 52:03.600
It's a good game.

52:03.600 --> 52:07.800
I have to, I have to do a trolling dedicated to dark Tetsuya.

52:07.800 --> 52:08.800
If I may.

52:08.800 --> 52:09.800
Yeah.

52:09.800 --> 52:19.000
I do not torrent porn or torrent anything so goddamn slow.

52:19.000 --> 52:22.240
Why would I turn anything when there's no, I'm going to torrent that breadstick and go

52:22.240 --> 52:23.240
right ahead.

52:23.240 --> 52:25.120
You're going to torrent me half of it.

52:25.120 --> 52:29.000
And I don't torrent hentai or porn, at least not here.

52:29.000 --> 52:30.000
I mean, shit.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.200
This connection is too damn slow for that.

52:32.200 --> 52:35.640
Um, anyways, uh, so let's talk a little bit about Woodstock.

52:35.640 --> 52:42.240
No, I'm not talking about the, the gathering of musicians and sweaty people.

52:42.240 --> 52:48.880
I'm talking about Microsoft's brand new music service for the Xbox 360.

52:48.880 --> 52:50.840
Whoopty shit.

52:50.840 --> 52:55.400
Um, I guess because Zune maybe is not taking off too well.

52:55.400 --> 53:00.200
But um, I, oh, it's actually a relaunch and rebranding of the Zune music service.

53:00.200 --> 53:02.280
Oh, well then I'm really not interested now.

53:02.280 --> 53:04.920
Um, but anyways, they're dubbing it Woodstock.

53:04.920 --> 53:08.960
It's supposed to be coming out on multiple platforms, including, you know, the Xbox 360,

53:08.960 --> 53:11.480
Windows 8, iOS and Android devices.

53:11.480 --> 53:15.960
Um, they're also saying that of course it's going to launch, um, it's not going to launch

53:15.960 --> 53:19.080
till the fall with, you know, the Windows 8 launch.

53:19.080 --> 53:24.440
Um, but it's going to be similar to like Spotify and they're going to have some sort of Facebook

53:24.440 --> 53:28.720
integration as well where you can share your playlists and that kind of stuff.

53:28.720 --> 53:32.760
And you can buy bottled water for $7.

53:32.760 --> 53:33.760
Come on.

53:33.760 --> 53:34.760
There's a, it's a Starbucks.

53:34.760 --> 53:36.640
There's a Woodstock 94 joke in there.

53:36.640 --> 53:37.640
Come on people.

53:37.640 --> 53:39.640
Oh Rob.

53:39.640 --> 53:43.120
The thing about Woodstock, it's kind of funny that they're taking that name because everything

53:43.120 --> 53:46.200
like recent Woodstock hasn't been that great.

53:46.200 --> 53:51.020
Like there was some really bad things that happened at those Woodstock revival festivals

53:51.020 --> 53:52.240
or whatever in the nineties.

53:52.240 --> 53:55.480
Like I'm talking things happening in those mosh pits and stuff that really should not

53:55.480 --> 53:58.360
be happening anywhere period ever.

53:58.360 --> 54:02.060
And you know how much all of the people at the original Woodstock got paid like oodles

54:02.060 --> 54:04.640
and oodles and oodles to freaking be there.

54:04.640 --> 54:08.840
And they like underestimated the number of people that would come and there was no toiletries

54:08.840 --> 54:11.400
and people died and babies were born.

54:11.400 --> 54:14.280
But I, the Woodstock I was thinking of was a cute little yellow bird that hangs out with

54:14.280 --> 54:15.280
Snoopy.

54:15.280 --> 54:21.200
I just, all right, so they're going to have a music service.

54:21.200 --> 54:24.360
I hope it's free because otherwise I'm not going to be interested in it.

54:24.360 --> 54:26.800
Let's talk about this other half of it then.

54:26.800 --> 54:32.560
But why is Microsoft relaunching this again when they've really tried that zoom thing

54:32.560 --> 54:38.120
and it just like, you know, because now they're trying to be the entertainment hub.

54:38.120 --> 54:43.840
They want the Xbox 360 or even whatever the next console is to be this entertainment hub.

54:43.840 --> 54:47.760
They're trying to get away from just being a games console they want.

54:47.760 --> 54:49.600
It's a kind of replace like your set top box.

54:49.600 --> 54:54.480
You put it in, you know, your living room with your TV and you're watching movies on

54:54.480 --> 54:55.480
there.

54:55.480 --> 54:56.480
You're playing games on there.

54:56.480 --> 55:00.320
Everybody's in front of it with connect your, you know, listening to music.

55:00.320 --> 55:03.480
They want it to be integrated with your life basically.

55:03.480 --> 55:05.520
Um, and that's what they're trying to do with this.

55:05.520 --> 55:06.520
They're adding music to it.

55:06.520 --> 55:08.240
I agree with infinite in the chat room.

55:08.240 --> 55:10.360
Wayne stock was much safer.

55:10.360 --> 55:11.360
That's true.

55:11.360 --> 55:15.280
If they call this Wayne stock, I would, uh, I would be kidding and give my right arm.

55:15.280 --> 55:18.680
Yes, no right eye.

55:18.680 --> 55:20.320
That was it.

55:20.320 --> 55:25.120
All right, let's move on with some more news.

55:25.120 --> 55:27.000
And this one has to do with Skyrim.

55:27.000 --> 55:30.360
Hey, and it has nothing to do with arrows and body parts.

55:30.360 --> 55:31.360
I swear.

55:31.360 --> 55:36.440
This has to do with a Skyrim expansion pack, maybe question mark.

55:36.440 --> 55:40.840
Apparently in the latest Skyrim patch, there are several references to what's called snow

55:40.840 --> 55:45.520
elves, including a snow elf Prince who has some dialogue.

55:45.520 --> 55:50.960
Uh, there's also files talking about crossbows, a whole folder called DLC01.

55:50.960 --> 55:52.320
Hmm.

55:52.320 --> 55:53.720
What could that be about?

55:53.720 --> 55:57.840
So apparently this is information about the first DLC pack for Skyrim.

55:57.840 --> 55:59.360
We don't know a whole lot else about it.

55:59.360 --> 56:02.680
Although there's certainly that part of me that says, I'm going to buy it.

56:02.680 --> 56:06.360
Well that, and gee, this, this took a little while for this to come out.

56:06.360 --> 56:08.200
You too can take an X to the elbow.

56:08.200 --> 56:11.560
Good things come to those who wait, usually.

56:11.560 --> 56:17.840
I have more faith in Bethesda and DLC versus any other company on the face of the earth.

56:17.840 --> 56:24.520
Um, just because it seems like their content is very, you know, thoroughly rich and full

56:24.520 --> 56:30.360
of, you know, actual new things and not stuff that was on the disc.

56:30.360 --> 56:32.160
Plus crossbows are pretty awesome.

56:32.160 --> 56:33.160
Crossbows are pretty awesome.

56:33.160 --> 56:35.520
Autocrossbows are even better.

56:35.520 --> 56:38.400
One of these days I'll stop playing Mass Effect long enough to go back and play these other

56:38.400 --> 56:40.080
games I've missed like Skyrim and stuff.

56:40.080 --> 56:41.800
But you know the problem with crossbows is...

56:41.800 --> 56:45.120
And run a certain somebody through a couple of dungeons on WoW.

56:45.120 --> 56:46.120
Maybe.

56:46.120 --> 56:48.600
Maybe reload.

56:48.600 --> 56:49.600
It's a Game of Thrones run.

56:49.600 --> 56:51.600
What if it's like an autocrossbow?

56:51.600 --> 56:55.280
Gee, that'd be awesome.

56:55.280 --> 56:57.200
So Final Fantasy 6-ish.

56:57.200 --> 57:00.720
Moving on, Dark Sakura.

57:00.720 --> 57:03.320
How about some Vita crap?

57:03.320 --> 57:07.960
Um, because it is actually kind of performing like crap.

57:07.960 --> 57:09.240
In Europe anyway.

57:09.240 --> 57:16.160
Um, the Vita is being outsold by both the Wii and the PSP in Europe.

57:16.160 --> 57:23.200
Um, they're basically saying, um, that, uh, and this is actually a quote from Iwata of

57:23.200 --> 57:24.200
Nintendo.

57:24.200 --> 57:27.600
Saying that based on sales information by market research companies in each European

57:27.600 --> 57:36.800
country, um, basically that the PS3 is the top with the 3DS and Xbox 360 in second.

57:36.800 --> 57:44.480
The Wii in fourth, PSP in fifth, the Vita in sixth, and the DS, um, I guess right after

57:44.480 --> 57:45.480
that.

57:45.480 --> 57:49.880
So yeah, um, the Vita is basically selling 25,000 units a week.

57:49.880 --> 57:54.540
Um, and there's still 70,000 PS3s being sold weekly.

57:54.540 --> 57:57.920
Well that's some good news for Sony, at least the PS3's on top over there.

57:57.920 --> 58:00.000
But Loki, any idea what this looks like in America?

58:00.000 --> 58:01.000
Is this the same?

58:01.000 --> 58:02.800
Are they having the same issue here?

58:02.800 --> 58:08.080
I'm surprised that anyone's still selling a ton of PSPs, I know we don't sell any PSPs.

58:08.080 --> 58:12.240
Um, and by we I mean my customers, because no one's asking for them.

58:12.240 --> 58:14.360
And hell, there's nothing coming out for the PSP.

58:14.360 --> 58:22.080
I mean, last thing was MLB 12, or MLB, um, yeah MLB The Show 12, wait no, MLB 2K12.

58:22.080 --> 58:28.560
Um, but, and then there's a few Atlus RPGs, but that's all that really is coming.

58:28.560 --> 58:33.200
According to Iwata right now in the US, um, actually no this isn't just according to him,

58:33.200 --> 58:36.000
but there's other, there is a listing on here.

58:36.000 --> 58:42.600
At the top of it is Xbox 360, then PS3, then the 3DS, and the Vita right behind the 3DS

58:42.600 --> 58:46.320
and forth, then we have Wii, DS, and PSP.

58:46.320 --> 58:51.400
Why is Iwata talking about the Vita, oh I see, because he's trying to say the 3DS is

58:51.400 --> 58:52.400
so much better, blah blah blah.

58:52.400 --> 58:55.880
Well he's saying that right now the 3DS is dominating in Japan.

58:55.880 --> 58:56.880
I see.

58:56.880 --> 58:58.080
Well it's been out for a year!

58:58.080 --> 58:59.080
I mean, come on!

58:59.080 --> 59:01.800
I mean, why are we even comparing these two systems, you're talking about a system that

59:01.800 --> 59:04.800
launched two months ago versus a system that's been out like for a year.

59:04.800 --> 59:09.320
Well and the Vita is kinda in that point where the 3DS was at this point after its launch,

59:09.320 --> 59:13.120
where like, hooray, we had the launch with all the big launch games, now we're in a lull.

59:13.120 --> 59:17.120
Yeah, it's like, listen Iwata, you better fuckin' keep that good karma coming because

59:17.120 --> 59:21.160
if you start talking, you know, crap about this, you've got a system launching pretty

59:21.160 --> 59:23.360
soon and it could tank pretty easy.

59:23.360 --> 59:29.520
Well, really he's just been, you know, just speaking, more not, instead of you know, pooping

59:29.520 --> 59:34.480
on everybody else, he's just more been speaking about, oh the 3DS is doing very well, we're

59:34.480 --> 59:36.760
very confident in how the market's going.

59:36.760 --> 59:40.840
But to the Vita's credit, I mean, you know, it's not the, because they do have some big

59:40.840 --> 59:44.160
things here and there coming out, like the Mortal Kombat Vita is out pretty soon, that's

59:44.160 --> 59:45.720
gonna be a pretty big deal for them.

59:45.720 --> 59:49.600
They did release Skype on the Vita this week, which is pretty cool, you know, like their

59:49.600 --> 59:55.960
FaceTime-esque sorta app, and I actually checked that out on the Vita, it runs very nicely.

59:55.960 --> 01:00:00.660
And you know, the Vita does, had a more robust launch lineup, but it is still, there's nothing

01:00:00.660 --> 01:00:05.520
to really get, I mean, Mortal Kombat, whether, you know, it is what it is, it's been out

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:08.480
already, it is a port of a game that's already been out for a year.

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:13.720
I would think come the holidays, E3 this year, we're gonna hear more about what the holidays

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:16.520
have in store for the Vita, and that's when things are really gonna pick up for them again.

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:20.400
To be fair, that's one more Mortal Kombat game than the 3DS has.

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:21.400
True.

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:23.880
No one's porting shit to the 3DS.

01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:28.920
True, unless you want to say, well, you can play DS games on the 3DS, and I think there

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:33.080
was, I think Deadly Alliance, or one of them got a port to the DS, probably wasn't very

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:34.600
good, but it's there.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:41.520
I mean, there's a Street Fighter IV game, you know, I don't know, it's just, yeah, I

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:45.720
don't really think it's fair to compare them yet, it's still, you know, compare their one

01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:46.720
year numbers, okay?

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:51.640
One year, compare the numbers of the 3DS versus the numbers of the Vita in a year, and see

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:52.640
where they're at.

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:54.560
I'm not surprised that they're behind the 3DS.

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:57.640
A lot more people are picking up 3DSs, because I think they're cheaper now.

01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:02.160
Shadownextgen in our chatroom at vognetwork.com says, a Vita price drop will be announced

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:05.760
to E3 if Sony is smart, agree?

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:12.000
They could, I know that the 3DS isn't dropping in price any time soon, so, I mean, they could,

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.640
it would be smart, but, I hope I get some free games with it.

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:21.000
I don't think a price drop will come, but I think they'll sweeten the pot of the existing

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.200
pack.

01:01:22.200 --> 01:01:27.960
What I mean by that is, larger memory card, and probably more, like, throw-ins, like,

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:33.360
comes with an 8 gig memory card that already has little big planet Vita, oops, that's another

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:36.380
big game that's coming out at some point, right, no, that got pushed back, right?

01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:38.720
It's not coming out any time soon, they haven't announced the date for it yet.

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:41.280
Alright, then fucking ModNation Racers Vita, I don't know, just...

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:45.200
Well, they could have Resistance, there's Gravity, you know, Gravity Rush, there's...

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:48.680
I would think they're gonna sweeten the pot of the existing pack, I don't think they're

01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:50.480
gonna lower the price necessarily.

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:54.240
You know, I mean, they do like doing these different bundles, so, I could see them doing

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:56.960
some special, like, holiday bundles and stuff like that.

01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:00.080
Baconbits in our chatroom, this will be the last comment on this story, then we'll move

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:04.160
on, Baconbits in our chatroom says, I don't want the Vita to fail, but I feel like it's

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:05.320
gonna happen.

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:06.320
It's too early!

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:10.480
Yeah, it's too, again, you gotta go back to where the 3DS was at this point, everybody

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:15.960
said, 3DS is gonna fail, 3DS is gonna fail, and then, bam, price drop, bam, Mario, bam,

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:20.440
you know, it's just, everything just hit it once, and then the system really recovered.

01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:26.760
You know, and the PlayStation 3, early on, was hideous!

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:31.440
Too damn expensive and nothing on it, you know, but, PlayStations really come around,

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:35.720
so, you know, I think it's too early to bury the Vita.

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:40.240
Is the Vita flying off shelves in the must-have technology that Sony wanted it to be?

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:44.640
Alright, maybe not, but, that doesn't mean it's a dead and dying system.

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:49.880
They tried, I think, I mean, they had a better lineup at launch than the 3DS had, that's

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:54.680
for sure, and they have a lot more games coming out, and even the 3DS, I mean, there's games

01:02:54.680 --> 01:03:00.280
coming out, but, I mean, for, I would think that, you know, like the hardcore gamer look,

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:04.080
you know, using the 3DS, I think there's only a handful of games really coming out before

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:07.840
the end of this year that they might be interested in, whereas I think there's gonna be a lot

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:13.520
more of that for the, the, I'm sorry, the 3DS has a handful of games.

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:17.120
The Vita, I think they've got, you know, quite a bit of potential games coming out for it,

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:21.800
I mean, hell, you know, there's some big first party games still on their way in the next

01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:27.320
couple months, and, you know, Call of Duty's gonna help, I mean, fuck, a portable Call

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:28.320
of Duty game?

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:33.280
You know, not necessarily the PSP ones, because they're kinda, yeah, but, you know, one on

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:36.980
the Vita that's, you know, you've got like Black Ops 2 or whatever they're gonna call

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:40.360
it on the Vita, that could be pretty big.

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:43.960
Slidekick in our chatroom says, girl, PS3 is still hideous, Rob.

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:44.960
I disagree.

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:45.960
I really disagree.

01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:51.720
It's, Little Big Planet is my, that's, there is nothing like it on Nintendo, there's nothing

01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:57.360
like it on Microsoft, and it is an incredible video game, and it's, it's Sony's franchise,

01:03:57.360 --> 01:04:00.020
you know, and that's just, you know, that's just the one that comes up to the mind is

01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:01.440
most important for me.

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:06.840
I still say Sony, despite all our jokes earlier about Sixaxis, I think now Sony has the better

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:07.840
controller.

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:11.280
I prefer to play games with the Sony controller than I do the 360.

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.920
Sony does have the free online, for whatever it's worth.

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:19.280
You know, I don't mean to sound like a fanboy, there's reasons why I like 360 as well, but,

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:21.960
you know, I don't think it's all doom and gloom with the PlayStation 3.

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:25.600
I think, I think consumers have a real choice to make.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:30.480
And when somebody asks me, Rob, what should I get, a PlayStation 3 or a Xbox 360?

01:04:30.480 --> 01:04:34.640
It's a, I have to go back to the golden rule of gaming, a system is only as good as the

01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:35.640
games that are on it.

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:36.640
What do you wanna play?

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:37.640
You wanna play Mario?

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:38.640
Or you wanna play LittleBigPlanet?

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:39.640
You wanna play Fable?

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:41.600
Or you wanna play God of War?

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:45.080
You know, it's really about those issues.

01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:49.760
All right, anyhow, let's move on with some release dates.

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:53.400
We're gonna travel around the world and check out what's coming out soon in a store near

01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:54.400
you.

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:57.200
There's not a lot this week, it's pretty dead.

01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:04.680
So starting things off, we've got Sniper Elite V2 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 this week.

01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:08.040
Terra Online in the collector's edition as well.

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:11.320
That's coming out on PC, which should be pretty awesome.

01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:15.200
Speaking of Mortal Kombat for the Vita, that is coming out this week.

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:23.440
And... and I honestly think that's probably it, because it's pretty dead.

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:26.840
I just wanna make sure I didn't miss anything.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:28.440
Yep, that's it.

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:32.560
All right, traveling to Japan and looking at the releases over there in Japan.

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:36.080
Nothing on the 3DS this week, which strikes me as kinda odd, but yeah, no, nothing, nothing.

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.800
Oh my God, the system's dying!

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:42.920
Well, how about the Vita, what's the Vita got this week?

01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:43.920
Also nothing.

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:44.920
That's a very...

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:45.920
That is also dying.

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:47.240
They're all dying.

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:51.960
On the PlayStation 3 this week, Starhawk on May 10th, although I think that's really next

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:52.960
week, actually.

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:53.960
That's the week after, yeah.

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:56.120
So, is there a holiday in Japan this week or something?

01:05:56.120 --> 01:06:00.720
Because nothing on the PlayStation 3, and on the Xbox 360, nothing.

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:05.000
Oh my God, all game systems are gonna die.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.240
They're all dying.

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:08.680
All of them.

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:09.680
Is it...

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:13.580
I don't know what's going on, there must be something, but it's very... not a lot of releases

01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:14.580
till May 17th.

01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:16.960
Things are kinda slowing down over there.

01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:19.480
So I have nothing to report for Japanese releases.

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:24.060
Hey, the good news is, for those of you who like to import games, your wallet is spared

01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:25.740
this month.

01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:28.080
There's a few in Europe.

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:29.080
We have...

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:30.660
Thank you, Golden Week is this week.

01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:31.660
That's right.

01:06:31.660 --> 01:06:32.660
The chatters all just chimed in.

01:06:32.660 --> 01:06:33.660
It's Golden Week.

01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:35.600
That's when everyone goes back to their hometown.

01:06:35.600 --> 01:06:36.600
Yep.

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:37.600
Yep.

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:40.600
What, no handheld games for the train ride there?

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:41.600
No Animal Crossing?

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:44.040
Rob, places are closed all week.

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:48.120
I knew, see, I knew the chatters would know something cultural that I was missing.

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:50.080
So yeah, Golden Week is the reason.

01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:52.240
You know, us Ignite gamers.

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:55.420
I know, stupid Americans, sorry.

01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:59.080
In Europe, on May 2nd, we have Velocity for the PSP.

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:01.000
On May 3rd, we have Terra for PC.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:06.960
And on the 4th, we have Mud FIM, Motorcross World Championship, and that is it.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:07.960
Next!

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:12.060
It must be Golden Week in the UK as well, huh?

01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:13.060
It's no...

01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:14.060
I want a Golden Week.

01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:15.400
Why don't we have a Golden Week in the US?

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:16.400
Because we have Spring Break.

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:17.400
Yeah, but...

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:19.640
I wish we had Golden Week, too.

01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:21.880
Shit doesn't close on Spring Break.

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:22.880
But...

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:23.880
That's because people...

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:24.880
Okay.

01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:27.040
People here have no respect for their hometown, end of story.

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:31.080
We're comparing Golden Week to Spring Break.

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:33.000
Let's examine the two.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:38.760
Golden Week, a great chance for me to go visit my family and really honor my family and,

01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:44.060
you know, just be kind of forced to spend time with those I love and what's important.

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:49.280
Spring Break, bitches be getting drunk and topless and horny.

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:50.920
Woo!

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:54.720
I'm gonna get laid on Spring Break.

01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:55.720
We don't understand.

01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:56.720
Yeah!

01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:57.720
It's Golden Week in Mexico.

01:07:57.720 --> 01:07:58.720
Because...

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:01.360
See, it's Golden Week in Cancun.

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:04.840
Yeah, I mean, because they're like, cha-ching!

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:08.200
Here's our yearly revenue in one week.

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.200
I'm re...

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:13.680
It's Golden Peso Week, I don't know.

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:14.680
Exactly.

01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:18.840
Slidekick in our chatroom says, Spring Break is better because it has wet t-shirt contests.

01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:20.680
I didn't see that in Golden Week.

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:23.680
Can we move on, please?

01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:25.800
Yes, we can move on.

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:26.800
Loki.

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:34.440
Maybe Golden Week all throughout the year if there's wet t-shirt contests involved.

01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:36.000
And drunk sluts.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.160
Well, for some people, that may be their hometown.

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:40.960
That's just Friday.

01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:43.480
That's just Friday.

01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:46.320
In here, it's always Friday.

01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:49.120
Uh, yes.

01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:52.320
Nintendo has some losses to report.

01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:57.040
Yeah, they may have lost a little bit of money with 3DS.

01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:01.920
Four hundred and sixty-one point two million dollars in losses, to be exact.

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:06.160
And of course, you know, they've kind of rebounded a little bit, but you know, the initial hit

01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:12.800
from the new, you know, 3DS launch, and you know, the Redo's selling, well, also dropping

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:18.120
the price of the Wii, and they're seeing, you know, the strong-in and other things factored

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:19.120
into it.

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:20.120
Not a big surprise.

01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:22.160
Of course, their brand new fiscal year started.

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:30.120
April first, and you know, they're aiming to not sell the 3DS under cost, because right

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:36.460
now they're actually losing money on each system that's being put out.

01:09:36.460 --> 01:09:37.460
But not much.

01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:43.240
I mean, they're, I believe it's, uh, actually no, it doesn't say how much they're losing

01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:44.240
there.

01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:45.240
I thought it was only like a few bucks.

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:48.920
But, you know, they're taking losses on each system, and of course, Nintendo, unlike the

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:52.680
other companies, they're actually like making profits on each piece of hardware that goes

01:09:52.680 --> 01:10:00.200
out, which they were doing, obviously, when it was $250, but not necessarily now.

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:06.480
And then of course, they're saying that with the Wii U launch, and the Wii console, by

01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:12.320
the end of next fiscal year, which would be March 31st, 2013, they're gonna have combined

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:23.800
sales of 10.5 million units, um, during that whole year, um, eh, maybe.

01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:31.680
I guess, well fiscal 2012, they sold 9.84 million Wii units, so they're planning on

01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:33.240
growing that a bit more.

01:10:33.240 --> 01:10:39.320
Honestly, I don't see the Wii selling as fast as, you know, it was before.

01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:42.440
Although, if they announce another price drop, because there's a new concept coming out.

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:45.800
I was gonna say a price drop is, that, that has to factor into this somehow.

01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:49.880
If they drop the price again, that could be interesting.

01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:52.800
Is that Wii, isn't the Wii already like 99 bucks, or?

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:54.440
No, it's still like 149.

01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:59.480
Okay, so let's say they're gonna come out and the Wii is 99 bucks, that is, that's gonna

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:00.480
be hard to ignore.

01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:03.920
Especially for the, like, you know what the big audience is for that, it's nobody that

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:07.560
listens to this show, unless you have like a 5 to 12 year old.

01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:08.560
But here's my problem.

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:10.680
It's a huge sweet spot for the Wii.

01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:15.440
That is a huge sweet spot for the Wii, and it will cannibalize the Wii U's sales.

01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:20.480
Cause, I can buy this brand new console, it's basically a Wii, but it has better graphics

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:27.200
for $2.99, or I can pay $99 and get a Wii and play all these Mario games that I really

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:30.800
wanna play, and, um, that's it.

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:33.680
Then later on I'll upgrade to the, you know, the new Wii.

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:38.600
If there was a new Xbox or Playstation this year, I might agree with you, but I actually

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:43.600
think core gamer interest may be a little higher, especially if Nintendo does it right

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:46.480
and throws out a new Zelda game with this, although I'm not expecting it.

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:47.480
I'm not expecting it.

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:53.080
Or a Metroid, or something, you know, that the core gamers are gonna jizz over.

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:57.400
Just like seeing the lineup, just like kind of the whispers and stuff of their lineup.

01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:03.500
A lot of it is like, Batman Arkham City, great, I get to play it on the Wii U, but it's been

01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:07.920
out for a fucking year, and you know, Darksiders 2, okay, well that might be delayed by the

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:12.280
time we get there to, you know, the launch of the Wii, but it'll be out, like, Ninja

01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:16.280
Gaiden 3, a game that sucked on the Xbox 360 and PS3.

01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:20.000
Look, I think we really don't know though, because what Nintendo was trying to do with

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:23.200
that was say, hey, we can compete with everybody else now.

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:26.960
We're gonna have all the games that the other systems have, so leave us alone.

01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:29.200
We don't really know what's coming.

01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:31.240
I really do know what's coming.

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:35.240
Batman Arkham City is coming for the Wii U, I mean.

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:39.280
What if, heaven forbid, Loki, what if they're actually keeping some secrets?

01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:40.280
They may have some first party secrets.

01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:41.760
Animal Crossing Wii U.

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:43.080
Oh god.

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:46.520
I'm not buying it for, I'm sorry, I will not buy a system for Animal Crossing.

01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:48.480
Now your little, your little Wii pad is a screwball.

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:57.640
I did that for GameDram, okay, but I will not do that for, no, seriously, it's just,

01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:00.440
they're probably, they will probably have a Zelda game or something like that.

01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:02.040
That would be pretty smart.

01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:04.760
I don't think a Pikmin game is gonna launch that goddamn system, but.

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:07.900
I hope I'm not stepping on a story coming up later, because I remember reading this

01:13:07.900 --> 01:13:12.260
earlier, but, you know, Nintendo has been talking about a new franchise.

01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:14.520
Like maybe it's time for a new character.

01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:15.520
Cool.

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:18.120
And I'm down with that, absolutely.

01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:19.560
They need some new franchises.

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:20.560
Why not?

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:24.160
Well, I don't think they need franchises as bad as some other systems, but.

01:13:24.160 --> 01:13:26.040
Well, I think that they should have some new franchises.

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:27.040
Why not?

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:29.640
I mean, see, I mean, fuck.

01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:32.600
Story's kind of getting old, you know.

01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:37.360
Maybe about time, Kid Icarus seems to have revived successfully enough.

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:40.320
Maybe when it's time you start looking at a franchise and put out a game for it in a

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:44.480
while that might be of the racing genre.

01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:48.880
Although I do not disagree, what about a just new, something that doesn't exist yet?

01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:53.040
I mean, Animal Crossing didn't exist until, well, here in America, the GameCube, but the

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:54.040
64.

01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:55.040
You know, I completely agree with you.

01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:56.040
You know it hasn't existed yet?

01:13:56.040 --> 01:14:00.600
The fucking sequel to Excite Truck is what we need, is we need to excite truck too.

01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:04.600
No, seriously, the best racing game on the Wii, eh, let's just piss it away.

01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:08.240
We're gonna make a game with fucking mini games in the middle of a race.

01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:09.600
That was geniusly stupid.

01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:12.160
Look, I have more Wii stuff I gotta get out of here.

01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:17.280
This is important because when the Wii U launches, one thing Nintendo's committed to, oh, I

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:22.440
should say, sorry, excuse me, misspoke, exploring, but when I read something like this, I go,

01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:23.760
they're gonna do it.

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:29.240
Digital distribution of full retail games, starting on the 3DS, not even just the Wii

01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:34.440
U, but starting on the 3DS with New Super Mario Brothers 2, will be available, digital

01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:39.440
download as well as full retail release, but they made it very clear, choice.

01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:41.440
You have a choice.

01:14:41.440 --> 01:14:43.160
Apparently- And no price break.

01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:46.440
They are being aggressive about the Wii U.

01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:51.480
Iwata did announce Wii U games will be both in stores and digital distribution at launch.

01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:54.360
See, I thought I had heard it confirmed in there, so I guess the 3DS is the one that's

01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:57.240
being explored, but the Wii U, this is going to happen.

01:14:57.240 --> 01:15:00.680
No, it is actually being done with the Wii, er, the 3DS.

01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:02.000
They said they were gonna be doing it.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:06.560
Oh, I, I was serious, they're exploring it, but that tells me it's gonna happen.

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:11.200
So anyhow, retailers will also be able to sell download codes, which is interesting.

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:13.920
Why would you do that?

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:17.860
I mean, I understand why you would do that, so you can take your games with you.

01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:22.440
But remember, they tie to the system, not the account, which is very important.

01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:27.200
I'm assuming if you ever upgrade your system, there's a way to transfer the licenses, because

01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:32.440
I think there is with the ambassador program on the DS, but, you know, just kinda keep-

01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:36.600
So anyhow, oh, yeah, they do, I guess they came out later and said, yes, we are doing

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:37.600
it.

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:42.040
Uh, August 2012 is when New Super Mario Brothers 2 is going to be the first game that's out.

01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:46.440
Uh, packaged and digital formats, consumers can make the choice.

01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:51.480
Also a game called Onitore, which is a temp name, is also supposed to be sold like this.

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:53.520
It's a brain age game.

01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:54.520
Yeah.

01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:55.520
Interesting.

01:15:55.520 --> 01:16:02.760
Uh, one other thing about the 3DS, uh, it's all gonna be connected on- excuse me, the

01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:08.840
Wii U and the 3DS are all connected through Nintendo eShop, and they say, quote, the majority,

01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:14.240
key word, of first party 3DS and Wii U games will be sold this way.

01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:19.840
The dual distribution strategy, digital downloads on launch day, you'll be able to get 16 digit

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:24.080
codes through the Nintendo eShop if you want to go buy it in a store or whatever.

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:27.360
That doesn't mean that I'm gonna open up a box and then it's gonna be a card, does it?

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:28.640
Cause that's kinda shitty.

01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:34.200
Um, no, but Sony has tried that before, and they had Potapon 2, it was like that.

01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:36.100
It was like, here's a case!

01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:38.680
Those Vita games aren't far from it.

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:42.120
There is nothing in that Vita case but a little plastic slot to put in that cartridge.

01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:45.760
You know what, at least that's something that I can sell back at some point if I feel like

01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:47.120
it or sell it used.

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:48.120
That's true.

01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:54.600
Um, but, once again though, I mean, this sounds like a great idea, but then we have to realize,

01:16:54.600 --> 01:17:00.120
you know, it works for the Vita, I think it could work for the 3DS, but when we're talking

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:05.400
games that are gonna be significantly larger in size, and I'm talking about like actual

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:10.880
storage space on like a blu-ray disc, it's gonna get fucking annoying.

01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:18.360
Yeah, I can download a title, you know, on my Wii U, but, I don't know, why would you?

01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:22.920
But at the same time, the 3DS, it makes sense because people want to take their games with

01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:23.920
them.

01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:26.840
They don't wanna have to carry a bunch of cartridges, they can, you know, store a bunch

01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:31.440
of games on there and that be done with it, but for the Wii U it doesn't make any sense.

01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:35.320
I mean, I understand some people download full game, full digital games on like the

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:37.800
PS3 and stuff, but you can upgrade the hard drive and that thing.

01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:42.800
I have a 500 gig hard drive, so that doesn't really bother me too much, but, you know,

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:48.280
if they're, they better have adequate storage, and it also takes a really long time.

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:53.960
Like I downloaded Infamous 1, which is a good 8 gig game, that took a couple hours.

01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:59.480
You know, I'm not gonna wanna do that for a game that's larger than a DVD-R.

01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:03.700
You know, we're talking like, you know, 6, double that size, maybe even triple that size.

01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:06.040
That's gonna, why would you do that and kill your bandwidth?

01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:09.400
Alright, let me give one other quote here about the license rights, so we can talk about

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:10.400
that real quick.

01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:15.800
Iwata did state that the 3DS retail games will be stored in the SD memory card and be

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:19.960
playable only with the hardware to which it was downloaded, so that, you know, unlike

01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:24.240
how you get to share a packaged software, the consumer cannot share the software with

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:29.320
other 3DS systems owned by other members of the family or friends.

01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:33.640
But that's not any different than the eShop games that are there now, like say VVVVV or

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:34.640
whatever, it's the same way.

01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:38.920
It's too bad they couldn't have just added a feature to the cards where you can download

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:43.640
it to a certain system, and once it's downloaded to that system, it marks something in the

01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:47.280
card that, you know, shows that it's been downloaded to a system and you can't download

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:48.280
it again.

01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:53.240
But you can still play the card, or you can revoke your privileges and then it, you know,

01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:56.960
clears out whatever that is, and granted I'm sure someone will hack, or could possibly

01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:57.960
hack it, but...

01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:00.680
Sort of like how iTunes has authorize, authorizing computers.

01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:01.960
Something like that, yeah.

01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:03.360
Yeah, that's a good way to think about it.

01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:07.440
I mean, but that would have required them to have, you know, forethought, you know,

01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:11.320
for this stuff, and since they didn't do that at launch, and it's been out for a year now,

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:12.960
probably not gonna happen.

01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:16.520
Porkchop in our chatroom says if the market goes entirely digital, it's a massive middle

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:17.960
finger to the gamer.

01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:20.760
And ShadowNextGen says that'll eventually happen, Porkchop.

01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:21.760
It's inevitable.

01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:23.200
It's not gonna happen.

01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:25.280
It's not gonna happen any time soon.

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:28.240
I don't think it'll happen soon, but...

01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:29.240
It's not.

01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:30.920
The consumer can ultimately reject it.

01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:31.920
The PSP Go.

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:34.800
I want a return of Neo Geo size cartridges.

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:37.320
The PSP Go was rejected by the consumer.

01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:42.700
It's not gonna happen because, first off, the consumer likes having physical product,

01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:46.400
and the reason why they like having, you know, physical product is because it feels like

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:48.300
they actually own something.

01:19:48.300 --> 01:19:53.040
Having everything digital that's basically allowing, like, a third party company, like,

01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:56.240
you know, Intender or whatever, they can revoke the privileges whenever they want.

01:19:56.240 --> 01:20:01.140
And just to be fair, ShadowNextGen in the chat says I didn't say it would happen soon, so...

01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:04.280
I don't think it's gonna happen any time in the near future, and...

01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:05.560
It's just, it's too convenient.

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:11.200
It's more convenient to go to a store, I mean, seriously, am I going to, uh, spend like ten

01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:16.740
minutes driving to a local store and picking up a copy of a game, oh, that's such an inconvenience,

01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:19.360
or wait six hours for the same game to fucking download?

01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:24.280
I'll tell you it's fucking convenient, and not to sound like a commercial, but, um, Amazon

01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:27.780
will have that fucker on my doorstep when I get home from work.

01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:29.360
That's convenient to me.

01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:34.660
It's, there are ways that are more convenient than, but the thing is, they want everyone

01:20:34.660 --> 01:20:38.520
to think digital is where it's at, because they make the most money with that, and they

01:20:38.520 --> 01:20:41.280
have the most control over their product that way.

01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:47.120
It kind of sort of eliminates piracy a little bit, I mean, it's not, not really, uh...

01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:50.920
We need to, we need to take a step back, you guys, we need to take a step back to simpler

01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:51.920
times.

01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:55.080
We need to go back to when digital distribution wasn't even a thing.

01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:56.080
It was nothing.

01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:58.240
You know how you digitally distributed something?

01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:02.200
You got it on the back of a truck to your nearby Chuck E. Cheese.

01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:03.200
That was distribution.

01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:06.920
The classic game of the week.

01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:11.440
Dark Soccer's gonna take a trip down memory lane and find a game inside the gaming vault

01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:18.040
that she thinks, hey, listen up, Iwata digital mofos.

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:22.280
This is a true classic that you all should play right freaking now.

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:25.680
Dark Soccer, what is the classic game of the week, the first classic game of the week involved?

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:28.800
Well, this is also one that comes from Dan, so thank him for that.

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:33.680
And I'm going to start off by reading actually the, the spoiler, the splash for the original

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:34.680
poster.

01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:35.680
Okay.

01:21:35.680 --> 01:21:38.480
First the pinball universe, now the world of video.

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:40.920
Once again, Williams reigns supreme.

01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:41.920
Mmm.

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:42.920
Defender.

01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:43.920
Defender.

01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:51.360
And, uh, is, I mean, how can we not go back to the real classics there, you know?

01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:57.880
So defender came out for the arcade, um, done by Williams in 1980, which is a shooting game,

01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:00.320
all 2d back in the day.

01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:01.320
Hi.

01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:05.500
And, um, you have to basically defeat all these different invading aliens while protecting

01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:07.400
your astronauts.

01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:11.960
It was developed by Eugene Jarvis, who I've actually at classic gaming expo a couple,

01:22:11.960 --> 01:22:16.940
a few years back, I got to sit in on a panel with him and it was just awesome listening

01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:18.060
to this guy talk about it.

01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:21.300
By the way, this video that we're playing the audio from is already quiet and this game

01:22:21.300 --> 01:22:23.520
didn't really have a lot of, you know, I didn't have a lot of noise.

01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:28.280
It was pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, not a lot to hear, but there are some laser noises for

01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:29.280
you.

01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:33.840
Um, anyway, uh, this was the first game that Eugene Jarvis programmed.

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:35.840
He was a pinball programmer before that.

01:22:35.840 --> 01:22:39.920
Um, and he was inspired by space invaders and asteroids.

01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:46.240
Um, the plan was to display the game at the amusement and music operators association.

01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:48.320
Um, but it was delayed.

01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:54.400
Um, the game itself though was highly successful, sold 55,000 units and it was their best selling

01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:56.760
arcade game.

01:22:56.760 --> 01:23:04.640
And uh, basically, uh, it's the game pretty much that put, you know, Eugene Jarvis's name

01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:10.980
amongst, you know, the, the top contributors to the video game industry there is.

01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:13.480
So that's pretty cool.

01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:20.460
At any rate, um, when it was developed, it was, uh, Williams, uh, first attempt at any

01:23:20.460 --> 01:23:22.540
video game there.

01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:28.160
The earlier one that they had was basically a version of Pong and, uh, they were really,

01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:33.920
really trying to cash in on how popular video games were getting in 1979.

01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:41.320
So they had basically one of their best pinball, uh, uh, programmers get right to it.

01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:45.520
He also, um, he headed the department and there's other like big names that were involved

01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:46.520
with that.

01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:51.840
Uh, Larry Damar, Sam Dicker, uh, Paul Dassault, um, they were all involved in this.

01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:55.840
They worked, uh, under him as the head.

01:23:55.840 --> 01:24:00.920
So basically, um, Jarvis, just going into the development history, spent three to four

01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:07.520
months, um, working on different versions of Taito space invaders and Atari's asteroids

01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:10.960
and, uh, tried to work games that had similar mechanics.

01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:15.880
Asteroids, of course, was, uh, vector, um, had a special monitor, but this one he wanted

01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:19.040
to really work on a conventional monitor.

01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:24.420
So, uh, basically they just, uh, took what they liked from asteroids being the warping

01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:28.080
effects they really liked and then wanted a player to be able to fly back and forth

01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:29.760
across the screen.

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:38.600
Um, he only wanted it to go, um, from left to right, but a person who I have met convinced

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:40.000
him to make it scroll around.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.720
You know who that is?

01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:43.720
Who?

01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:44.720
Steve Ritchie.

01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:45.720
Oh.

01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:49.360
Who was the man that designed, he actually was the voice of the Black Knight and the

01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:51.960
voice of the skull in, uh, No Fear.

01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:53.720
Was he the voice of Sinstar?

01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:54.720
Beware.

01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:55.720
Yes.

01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:56.720
I lit, that guy's awesome.

01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:57.720
I think, I think it was him.

01:24:57.720 --> 01:24:59.160
I want him to do bumpers for VoG.

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:01.200
But I could talk to him.

01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:02.200
Sweet.

01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:09.280
But, um, he, uh, he's also the guy that designed, uh, Twilight Zone and Black Knight.

01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:10.280
Steve Ritchie.

01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:12.920
He's, and he is the sweetest, sweetest guy.

01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:17.480
Anyway, um, moving forward, he basically was the guy that suggested that it should scroll

01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:18.480
in either direction.

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:25.800
So, it took six months to develop it and, uh, they really pushed it through and, uh,

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:32.680
so now, um, they have the, basically they added in the Planetscape background as sort

01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:33.720
of an afterthought.

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:39.240
And if you'll notice, it's only a pixel wide, those lines, because the hardware wasn't powerful

01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:42.640
enough to do anything better.

01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:46.320
So basically after that six months, they really pushed it for, uh, for the try to get it done

01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:48.760
by, um, AMOA.

01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:53.200
But it took a lot later to do and they incorporated more things.

01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:56.320
They had the swarmers, the pods, all the different gameplay.

01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:02.400
And then they had, um, they created erasable programmable read-only memory chips for the

01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:05.400
game to install the cabinets, but they didn't work.

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:08.720
So they actually had to do more to get it to work.

01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:10.560
They got the attract mode operational.

01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:14.840
They got all of the stuff done and finally had it playable.

01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:18.760
So the game itself is basically, um, it's monaural sound.

01:26:18.760 --> 01:26:26.720
It's pixel on CRT and it's being, uh, run by a Motorola again, uh, 6809 central processing

01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:27.720
chip.

01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:31.380
So, which is big stuff in 1980.

01:26:31.380 --> 01:26:36.600
So the game actually, um, it didn't really attract a lot of attention in 1980 when it

01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:42.720
came out, but it, uh, ended up, uh, being well received in the arcades.

01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:46.320
And there were tons of crowds during the play testing.

01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:49.440
So they actually did a cocktail version of this as well.

01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:52.000
So like I said, they sold over 55,000 units worldwide.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.600
I want a cocktail machine so fucking bad.

01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:58.560
By 2004, the game was a collector's item.

01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:04.040
Um, the upright cabinets you could still find, but the cocktail tables, of course, you know

01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:07.640
how that went, you can hardly find them at all.

01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:13.960
And, uh, it was actually considered one of the most successful games in 1981.

01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:14.960
It outperformed Pac-Man.

01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:15.960
Just saying.

01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:16.960
Huh?

01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:22.880
I mean, the graphics at its time or completely revolutionary.

01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:25.480
It did things that you hadn't seen in the game before.

01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:31.320
And you know, all this by a guy who had not ever done a video game before.

01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:32.320
He didn't pinball.

01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:34.760
But sometimes it just takes a different perspective.

01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:35.760
You know?

01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:36.760
Yeah.

01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:41.240
But I mean, and since then we've had so many different games, uh, reference it so many

01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:45.320
different games, uh, actually work off of things of it.

01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:50.680
There were software bugs in the game that allowed people to extend their length of time.

01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:52.880
And there was another one that kept track on how it scores.

01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:55.200
So basically people could keep earning extra lives and stuff.

01:27:55.200 --> 01:28:01.440
I mean, we're talking early game hacking, you know, this, you know, hacking, you know,

01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:03.720
Street Fighter X Tekken is nothing new.

01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:05.960
People were doing it in the 80s.

01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:10.160
Um, you remember the dude that did Pac-Man Fever?

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:11.160
Little Buckner and Garcia?

01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:12.280
Yeah, of course.

01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:19.040
This was, uh, they did a, uh, um, song called The Defender on that album.

01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:25.360
And Beastie Boys actually referred to it in Body Movin' because Beastie Boys are awesome.

01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:28.920
So I mean, and if you think about this, how many other games do we have come out since

01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:35.040
then that, like my, my favorite game, Fantasy Zone, is that not pretty much Defender?

01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:37.520
It inspired, heavily inspired.

01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:38.520
With Cutesy-ness?

01:28:38.520 --> 01:28:44.200
You know, we had, and of course this, you know, basically opened the door to all kinds

01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:48.720
of other games like, um, GORF and Phoenix.

01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:56.880
So just saying, you know, as far as remakes, um, there was, uh, a game called Stargate

01:28:56.880 --> 01:29:00.000
that was considered a sequel to Defender.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.600
Um, different elements.

01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:03.960
Uh, Midway put out Strike Force.

01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:08.320
Some folks in chat, by the way, talking about, uh, Defender 2 on the NES, which was Stargate,

01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:09.320
yeah.

01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:13.920
You know, as far as, uh, other home versions came out, like Defense Command, Reptile, Drop

01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:17.280
Zone, Protector 2, that copied the design.

01:29:17.280 --> 01:29:24.920
Um, Chopper Command for Atari 2600 and, uh, Choplifter for Apple II, um, were, again, mimics

01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:25.920
of Defender.

01:29:25.920 --> 01:29:26.920
I didn't even think about that.

01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:27.920
You're right.

01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:28.920
Chopper Command really was the same damn game.

01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:29.920
Yeah.

01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:30.920
I remember.

01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:31.920
I, uh, my friend owned that.

01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:32.920
We used to play the shit out of that.

01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:37.720
And it's been released on so many different, you know, re-releases like, uh, 1996's Williams

01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:43.160
Arcade Greatest Hits, the 2000 Midway's Arcade, um, Greatest Arcade Hits, and 2003 Midway

01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:44.720
Arcade Treasures.

01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:47.840
We also, um, on Shockwave.com, you can play Defender.

01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:53.240
Sorry, I just wanted to look really quickly at, uh, Chopper Command here on the Atari

01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:54.240
2600.

01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:57.960
Yeah, see, you have to protect your dudes on the bottom.

01:29:57.960 --> 01:29:59.520
Yeah, the little trucks on the bottom.

01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:00.520
Yeah.

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:01.520
Yeah.

01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:02.520
Did they get lifted up by the choppers?

01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:03.520
I forgot how that worked.

01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:06.400
Oh, no, they're just getting, but that's the difference.

01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:07.400
They don't get lifted up.

01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:08.400
They just get, like, attacked.

01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:09.400
Yeah.

01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:11.040
You have to save the little astronauts in Defender.

01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:13.360
That guy's not very good at Chopper Command.

01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:23.960
But anyway, I mean, and then, um, in 2002, there, um, there was the sequel that, uh,

01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:32.160
that was just called Defender that, uh, was, uh, uh, believe was the 3D that was, that

01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:33.160
worked similarly.

01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:35.160
So, but yeah, Defender.

01:30:35.160 --> 01:30:37.800
There it is, your classic game of the week, Defender.

01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:38.800
Good choice.

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:42.000
Now I, now I actually really do need to get a hold of Steve Ritchie.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:47.240
All right, that's going to do it for part A of Orange Launch Radio, but don't go anywhere.

01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:52.080
Part B is coming up next here on VOG, and we're going to start off with some big news

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:55.240
in part B, so I hope you guys don't go anywhere, because we'll be right back after this with

01:30:55.240 --> 01:31:03.600
more of Orange Launch Radio.

01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:08.080
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Launch Radio and our inaugural broadcast here on

01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:12.520
the VOG, vognetwork.com, the voice of geeks network.

01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:16.400
And right now, just three shows on the actual radio network, VOG network will be more than

01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:20.000
just a radio station, but that's kind of the, that's the centerpiece of the dinner table

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:21.360
right now is the radio station.

01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:26.040
Uh, just ourselves and, uh, Bobby Blackwolf, who you heard before us and the great folks

01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:32.800
at under sedation live in their 11th year, God bless them or whatever you believe in,

01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:37.440
uh, eight o'clock on Saturday Pacific, 11 o'clock Eastern.

01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:41.840
They're late night cause they're dirty, but it's a good time, a little dirty, but it's

01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:42.880
a good time.

01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:44.000
You should definitely tune in.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:46.680
I'll say this cause I know Jessica's in the chat right now.

01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:49.900
Jessica will whip Travis into shape on Saturday night.

01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:54.520
So if you want to hear him get a whooping tune in on Saturday, no, it's, it is a really

01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:55.520
good time.

01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:59.280
Uh, anyhow, I got to go back on that show and guess sometime for sure.

01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:06.240
Anyway, we are here and, uh, talking about video games and thank God some late breaking

01:32:06.240 --> 01:32:22.920
news, some late breaking news here on the VOG and orange lounge radio breaking news.

01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:25.640
And we have to go to our correspondent for this story.

01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:26.920
This isn't even my thing.

01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:31.520
This was a, we've got to go to our core respondent for this story.

01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:35.840
So I'm looking them up to give them a call right now, except, Oh, there he is.

01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:37.280
I always look under the wrong name here.

01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:40.480
So let's, uh, give our correspondent a little call here so we can talk about the breaking

01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:45.080
news this evening, all the way in New York city.

01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:46.080
Rama is joining us.

01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:47.080
Hey Rama, you there?

01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:48.080
Hey, I'm right here.

01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:49.080
Sky.

01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:50.080
How are you guys out in the Sacramento studios?

01:32:50.080 --> 01:32:55.320
I'm relieved because the show is actually online tonight because trust me, there was

01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:58.360
a plan B in case VOG didn't work, but it works.

01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:01.600
I mean, despite the hiccup earlier, that was a Comcast fail.

01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:02.600
We're shit.

01:33:02.600 --> 01:33:03.600
We're used to those.

01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:06.960
We've, we've had 10 years of those on the other networks we've been in.

01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:09.040
So otherwise VOG's working great.

01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:12.480
And I got to say this, I am so happy.

01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:13.800
I can't even tell you.

01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:18.560
We have hit higher numbers tonight on this new network than I've seen in a long, long,

01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:19.560
long time.

01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:22.760
And I think a lot of that really is just the combined forces of Bobby's audience and our

01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:26.480
audience and you know, the curious looky-loos, the people that Geek Life brought in just

01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:29.320
all kind of, you know, joining together tonight.

01:33:29.320 --> 01:33:31.060
And I, I'm just so happy.

01:33:31.060 --> 01:33:33.880
And I hope the momentum continues through the few weeks.

01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:34.880
I'm all for that.

01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:35.880
Yeah, me too.

01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:38.400
So anyway, it's not, you're not calling us to talk about VOG tonight.

01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:40.840
You have some news for us, I guess you become privy too.

01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:41.840
What's going on Rama?

01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:42.840
Yes, yes, yes.

01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:43.840
I do have news.

01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:49.440
Now recently with Anime Jam Session, we've gotten connected to another podcast out here

01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:51.260
called the Brooklyn Otaku.

01:33:51.260 --> 01:33:54.120
We've been joining forces and working on some projects.

01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:59.920
Now one of the hosts of the Brooklyn Otaku hooked me up with some very privy information

01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:03.040
today at the Sakura Matsuri.

01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:04.040
What's that?

01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:05.040
First off, Sakura Matsuri...

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:06.040
Cherry Blossom Festival.

01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:07.040
Cherry Blossom.

01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:08.040
Thank you.

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:11.080
I was going to let him explain, but that's all right.

01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:12.080
There he goes.

01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:14.520
Fair enough.

01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:19.280
So Sakura Matsuri, you ran into your friends at Brooklyn Otaku and?

01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:25.320
One of the hosts there has told me that the return of one of the greatest arcades in New

01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:27.600
York City will be back.

01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:31.520
Chinatown Fair is reopening this Friday.

01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:32.520
Yay!

01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:34.320
Chinatown Fair reopening this Friday.

01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:36.600
I've never been to Chinatown Fair.

01:34:36.600 --> 01:34:42.360
The legendary arcade in these parts was Arcade Infinity, which when I say in these parts

01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:44.240
I mean six hours away.

01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:46.400
But what makes Chinatown Fair so special?

01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:49.120
Why is this big news for the East Coast folks?

01:34:49.120 --> 01:34:52.080
It's like the bastion of arcade gaming.

01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:57.440
This is where you go to play all the greatest, at the time, fighting games, dancing games,

01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:58.440
all types of video games.

01:34:58.440 --> 01:34:59.880
This is where you came.

01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:05.080
It's like nowhere else in New York City you could go except here because it was quiet

01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:07.120
or loud, however you want to take it.

01:35:07.120 --> 01:35:08.120
And it was fun.

01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:12.840
Plus there was also a chicken that could tell you a fortune.

01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:16.600
Arcade Infinity did not have a fortune teller chicken.

01:35:16.600 --> 01:35:17.600
That's right.

01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:18.600
It did not have a fortune telling chicken.

01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:19.600
It did have um jammerlami.

01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:24.040
I didn't go to any of the other shops around there so they could have had fortune telling

01:35:24.040 --> 01:35:25.040
chickens.

01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:29.040
Is there a big opening plan thing scheduled?

01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:35.000
I do believe the grand opening will be this Friday and from my understanding they're changing

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:36.000
things around a little bit.

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:41.480
It's going to be more of a Chuck E. Cheese, Dave and Buster style place.

01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:44.880
I shudder when I hear Chuck E. Cheese but Dave and Buster, does that mean they're selling

01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:45.880
booze?

01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:49.520
Exclusive Chinatown Fair to carry booze in the parking lot.

01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:51.240
I hope so.

01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:55.080
I do believe I'll be going down there Friday after work to check it out and see what's

01:35:55.080 --> 01:35:56.080
going on.

01:35:56.080 --> 01:36:03.200
Well then I need picks and stuff for the VOG website feature stuff that will come later.

01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:04.200
Oh definitely.

01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:07.360
Dave and Buster's they mean not letting kids in.

01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:09.720
Yeah that'll be great.

01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:12.200
Exclusive kids band from the new Chinatown Fair.

01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:13.200
That's good.

01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:16.160
Well they were kind of sort of banned before.

01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:20.960
Pretty much if you were in school and you were there during school hours you were escorted

01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:25.080
out of the place but I've never been there during those times to see if they actually

01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:26.080
enforce that rule.

01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:30.040
Alright well thank you for sharing the news with us Rama and thanks to your friends at

01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:31.040
The Other Show too.

01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:34.280
Since we have you on the line I know you like to call in during the show later anyway.

01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:38.800
Is there anything else you want to share with us tonight about your week?

01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:43.640
Yeah but how about I save that for that portion of the show.

01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:46.520
Okay then I guess we'll wait for that call later on.

01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:49.160
Yeah if I can't make it on I can't make it on.

01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:50.160
It is what it is.

01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:51.160
We have a lot of new listeners.

01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:53.560
Those will let the fresh blood in you know.

01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:55.960
Yeah you gotta let other people have a turn once in a while Rama.

01:36:55.960 --> 01:36:57.120
Alright take care buddy.

01:36:57.120 --> 01:36:59.560
We're gonna get back to the show.

01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:02.520
Oh he hung up there you go.

01:37:02.520 --> 01:37:06.200
Alright there it is breaking news and also breaking news exclusive Loki's mic was off

01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:08.560
that whole time says the chatters.

01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:10.160
I don't know whatever.

01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:11.160
Can we hear you?

01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:13.600
I still can't hear you.

01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:14.800
Is mine on?

01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:18.480
I hear my voice.

01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:22.000
Your mic is, talk for a minute for me.

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:23.000
Hello.

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.280
Oh god.

01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:28.240
Didn't you, you didn't fiddle with anything over here?

01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:29.240
No.

01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:30.240
Oh.

01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:31.240
Rob had one mute.

01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:37.200
You fiddled with my microphone you bastard.

01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:39.200
I had nothing intelligent to interject.

01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:46.560
And the fail award of the evening goes to Rob for mute button fail.

01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:47.560
Like I'd fiddle with a microphone.

01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:48.560
What do you think I'd do?

01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:49.560
Hey!

01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:50.560
Chords!

01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:51.560
I'm gonna yank on those.

01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:52.560
You'd do it?

01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:55.160
No he's gonna pretend he's Sanrio and chew on them.

01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:57.160
I've never done that before.

01:37:57.160 --> 01:37:58.160
Alright whatever.

01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:03.320
I'm gonna hop up on the table and rage through the like.

01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:05.880
So Rob this coffee is delicious thank you.

01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:06.880
No you're welcome anytime.

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:09.400
I've just put up two pictures on the OLR website.

01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:10.680
Sure that's what they wanted to see.

01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:13.080
One of them was coffee and the other one was my mouse pad.

01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:16.320
Alright I'll take a short, we're gonna get to rapid fire news but sure I'll take a question.

01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:20.120
It's the show where every gamer has a voice so sometimes we get thrown random ass questions

01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:22.760
in the VoG chat room and I'll answer them.

01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:26.640
Nietzsche, OLR did you guys happen to play any of the Diablo 3 open beta?

01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:28.360
If so what class did you play?

01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:29.360
Hell no.

01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:32.760
I didn't play the open beta but I played the closed beta back in October and I played a

01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:34.280
monk and it was a lot of fun.

01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:37.400
I played monk and witch doctor and I really preferred monk.

01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:38.680
It was a good time.

01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:41.600
I called the witch doctor.

01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:42.880
It looked like, it looked interesting.

01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:47.160
I played the original Diablo and I had fun with that.

01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:48.400
I did not play any of the beta.

01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:55.880
I got invited to the beta for missile pandarian but I don't play wow so I have no interest

01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:56.880
in that.

01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:00.320
Everyone pretty much got invited in the last wave.

01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:02.920
Rapid fire news, let's get to it Loki.

01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:06.880
So this is interesting, Joyride is getting a sequel.

01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:07.880
Why?

01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:08.880
Why?

01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:09.880
I don't know.

01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:10.880
It wasn't a very fun game.

01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:14.320
It wasn't a very fun game but they're hoping to make it more fun by removing Kinect.

01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:16.560
Isn't that ironic?

01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:21.760
So yes, Joyride, not Kinect Joyride anymore, will be getting a brand new title on Xbox

01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:22.860
Live Arcade.

01:39:22.860 --> 01:39:28.800
It will be called Joyride Turbo and apparently it will have absolutely no Kinect support

01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:33.360
whatsoever and it's going to be just standard controller support which is fine if you think

01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:37.960
about it because originally it was supposed to be just a, you know, just an Xbox Live

01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:42.120
Arcade title that was supposed to be free and then they were going to have a bunch of

01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:45.320
other crap that you could download and expand it with because it was going to be a free

01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:46.320
to play type thing.

01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:50.120
They're going to have an all new stunt park and then I guess you can do different stunts

01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:54.800
like jumping off cliffs and whatnot but that'll be coming out later on.

01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:58.840
Maybe if it's, you know, supposed to be in the summer or something, maybe a part of their

01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:03.480
summer thing that they're doing, I'm going to be willing to bet.

01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:04.480
You know what?

01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:09.120
It sounds kind of interesting then if it is without, you know, Kinect because Kinect kind

01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:13.840
of hurt that game but it could have been fun.

01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:15.920
So I'd be willing to check out the demo at least.

01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:18.480
I'll check out the demo at least.

01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:19.480
So hmm.

01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:20.480
Alright.

01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:25.160
Now something I really could care less about or couldn't care less I guess, Pikmin 2 is

01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:29.120
getting its new play control game on the Wii this June.

01:40:29.120 --> 01:40:34.240
Now for those who may not remember, they did this thing called new play control way back

01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:40.120
in 2009 where they were taking some of these old GameCube games and adding some Wii support

01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:44.720
on top of them and that's about it and they had a couple games that came out and then

01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:50.520
they kind of stopped and this actually came out in Japan and Europe in 2009 but for whatever

01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:55.120
reason they decided, hey, we're going to bring it out in the US now.

01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:58.360
Thanks Nintendo for bringing this to us.

01:40:58.360 --> 01:41:03.880
So the Wii could have a game although it isn't, what the hell is the name of that game?

01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:04.880
The big?

01:41:04.880 --> 01:41:05.880
Why?

01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:06.880
It's escaping me.

01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:09.320
The last story is coming out, yes.

01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:11.760
I was going to say Litterbox Chronicles.

01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:16.560
The last story is coming out in June but honestly they haven't had a first party Wii title since,

01:41:16.560 --> 01:41:19.920
well, then Mario Party 9 had been the last first party Wii title and that was in the

01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:22.440
beginning of March.

01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:26.480
I mean they have an intended, they have the Pokemon Conquest game which you know, the

01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:28.640
Ice D-Wares cross Pokemon.

01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:31.960
Hey, I'm, I'm curious.

01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:32.960
Let's just put it that.

01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:33.960
I'm curious.

01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:41.120
Um, I just think it's kind of like, here, here you go, this is something that you really

01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:42.120
wanted.

01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:45.600
So, so we're going to like, what is it, we're going to get the, fuck, I don't even remember

01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:49.600
the other games that have been released in other territories but not, are we going to

01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:51.920
get Captain Rainbow at some point, you know?

01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:53.960
Are they going to like localize that?

01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:58.120
What the hell is Captain Rainbow?

01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:05.680
It was a game that came out in Japan that was, um, it was all these like old, uh.

01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:10.440
What was the one with all the sexy men dudes that was like hole in the wall basically?

01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:11.440
No, no.

01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:12.440
That did come out here, didn't it?

01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:13.440
That did come out here.

01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:15.240
Yes, that came out here but Captain Rainbow did not.

01:42:15.240 --> 01:42:19.120
Captain Rainbow was the one that had like all of the misfit Nintendo characters.

01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:24.320
Like Birdo was in it and stuff like that and it was just ridiculous.

01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:29.960
I want that, there's Birdo right there.

01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:36.400
What are you playing as?

01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:38.400
Captain Rainbow, dummy.

01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:39.960
Shut up.

01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:45.480
It's like just this panned out thing, I was like, he's Falcon Punching.

01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:50.920
His eyes are big flames.

01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:56.160
He's doing rainbow things to that door.

01:42:56.160 --> 01:42:58.680
Maybe they just think we wouldn't get it.

01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:00.200
I play it.

01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:07.560
Exactly, it's really weird but um, there was another game though that was, um, and I don't

01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:10.320
remember for the life of me what the hell it was called.

01:43:10.320 --> 01:43:14.120
It was like Disaster Day in Crisis or something like that, I think.

01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:15.640
You know what else we don't have here?

01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:17.720
Tingle's Adventure or whatever that game was.

01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:19.720
Yeah, it's because it sucked.

01:43:19.720 --> 01:43:23.880
I'm sorry, no Tingle game here.

01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:28.840
That's the new franchise Nintendo needs to explore, Tingle.

01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:30.240
Listen, no they don't.

01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:32.280
He is a really fucking annoying character.

01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:36.960
We do not need to bring this crap back up.

01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:40.160
Tingle's Epic Quest.

01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:41.640
I would, Epic Tingle.

01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:42.720
I will tell you what.

01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:45.560
You know what, I think Epic Tingle would be a better game.

01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:49.880
If they launch the Wii U at the Tingle game, I will buy that system.

01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:54.000
I thought you were going to say you'd dress up finally, the bet we've been trying to get

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.000
forever.

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.640
You know that would actually be like the easiest costume ever because all you'd have to do

01:43:57.640 --> 01:43:59.120
is like sweat in a hoodie.

01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:00.120
Alright.

01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:03.600
Moving on, do you have any other rapid fire news or is that it?

01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:04.600
That was it.

01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:08.680
No, no, I got one more and that's a little bit better and I'm sure this is gonna, this

01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:10.960
may actually sell some vidas for some people.

01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:17.600
DGMax Technica Tune is actually coming out to the North America region for the Vita this

01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:22.840
summer and will also, I guess, you know, it looks pretty awesome.

01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:25.920
It looks just like the arcade stuff.

01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:28.280
Alright.

01:44:28.280 --> 01:44:30.760
I'm very interested in DGMax Technica for the Vita actually.

01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:34.640
I think it'll be very fun and I'm sure some of our music game fans in the chat room are

01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:36.400
very much looking forward to this as well.

01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:39.120
So I mean, that is, that was kind of cool.

01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:41.600
Alright, let's move on to some other quick stories here.

01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:45.520
First one about THQ, who's been having some financial issues lately, even though things

01:44:45.520 --> 01:44:51.160
seem to be getting a little better, but one part is going away and that is ValueSoft.

01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:53.200
You may not know what ValueSoft is.

01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:54.600
I'm well aware of ValueSoft.

01:44:54.600 --> 01:44:56.840
No, they make budget PC games.

01:44:56.840 --> 01:44:59.280
So like when you see the little budget Wii games too.

01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:05.080
$10 rack at Target of PC games and all that, it's, these games are in there.

01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:07.720
I want to see they run by Activision at one time.

01:45:07.720 --> 01:45:12.240
Maybe, but they're not going to be run by THQ anymore because they just sold it off.

01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:17.320
Apparently they are the second largest US retail publisher of PC games in terms of units

01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:18.320
sold.

01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:19.320
I had no idea.

01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:25.840
But anyhow, I guess what is happening, oh no, I'm sorry, Cosme is buying them and together

01:45:25.840 --> 01:45:29.540
it will make them the second largest US retail publisher.

01:45:29.540 --> 01:45:30.540
So I see where it is.

01:45:30.540 --> 01:45:34.520
So ValueSoft was, wasn't, but now they will be with Cosme who they've sold it to.

01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:37.680
To be fair, they do have their purpose in the industry.

01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:40.800
It's like, you know, seriously, if you're having a game that you're putting out that

01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:45.240
maybe is not that great and not necessarily that's not that great, but, um, at least there's

01:45:45.240 --> 01:45:49.680
a publisher out there for your independent game if you really want to.

01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:53.600
So if OLR the game ever becomes a reality, maybe on ValueSoft, right?

01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:58.560
Yeah, yeah, digital is probably the better way to go.

01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:03.000
So heads up to those folks that play games like City of Heroes, Champions Online and

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:08.800
Star Trek Online, which would be Dark Sakura, Cryptic Studios found out that their systems

01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:10.560
have been hacked.

01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:11.720
That's right.

01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:18.840
They were hacked in December of 2010, about a year and a half ago, 16 months old when

01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:22.640
this hacking issue went on and it was just discovered this week and an email went out

01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:25.960
to everybody saying basically, LOL, we changed the passwords.

01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:28.320
How did Cryptic find this 16 months later?

01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:30.480
Through routine security checks and upgrades.

01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:32.800
Of course, I'm thinking that's not very routine.

01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:37.000
Is that the 16 month routine checkup?

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.040
Once every two years.

01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:43.080
Account information, including passwords may have been accessed by an unauthorized party.

01:46:43.080 --> 01:46:45.780
Of course, by now you probably would have had your account hacked.

01:46:45.780 --> 01:46:47.440
Maybe that's how they got into the Xboxes.

01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:49.040
No crap happened to my account.

01:46:49.040 --> 01:46:54.120
Just letting people know I logged, I logged in and nothing, everything was still there.

01:46:54.120 --> 01:46:55.320
So man, those hackers are good.

01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:57.080
They turned Star Trek to free to play.

01:46:57.080 --> 01:46:59.460
So I mean, they're pretty good.

01:46:59.460 --> 01:47:01.560
So I spent an hour playing Dabo.

01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:06.720
Yet another great tip to change your passwords and use unique passwords on every site.

01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:13.960
And it says that your network provider checks their security logs more than once every 16

01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:14.960
months.

01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:15.960
All right.

01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:20.640
And last but not least for my rapid fire news, Adam Sesser left G4.

01:47:20.640 --> 01:47:23.360
Good for him.

01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:24.360
You know what?

01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:29.080
Hey, I understand you may joke, but you know what?

01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:34.560
That guy, sadly, he was one of the good things from G4, not even G4, well, one of the good

01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:41.320
things left on G4 and one of the good things from Tech TV back when they're around.

01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:46.320
And you know, Bravo to him actually moving on to probably some better waters.

01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:51.320
I mean, I don't know why the game blogs feel the need to continually cover G4.

01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:54.600
G4 is not a gaming network and hasn't been for some time.

01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:55.600
They're covering G4.

01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:56.600
I think they're talking about Adam Sessler.

01:47:56.600 --> 01:48:01.360
I don't think they care if a rat's ass about G4, I think they care about Adam Sessler.

01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:06.720
I think that people are also curious- There's one response for that, Rob.

01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:08.720
Did you kill a fly?

01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:14.040
I think people maybe are hoping that he's going somewhere that will actually be gaming

01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:18.240
related, but it is important to say, apparently it was a contract dispute that got him out

01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:23.760
and you know, Comcast who owns G4, I'm sure wants to save money anywhere they can and

01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:29.600
probably doesn't throw a lot of money at a network that some, you know, like didn't

01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:32.200
DirecTV threaten to pull the plug on G4?

01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:33.200
Maybe they already did?

01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:37.440
Listen, we have enough cheater and cops reruns, we don't need you guys around here.

01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:43.620
Honestly, G4 to me seems like a network that'd be better suited for the internet.

01:48:43.620 --> 01:48:44.620
You know what I mean?

01:48:44.620 --> 01:48:49.480
Just having like digital content on the internet because they don't have much content to begin

01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:50.480
with.

01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:53.440
It's literally cops and cheaters reruns all the fucking time.

01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:56.480
The internet doesn't need them now, they have us.

01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:59.520
And in fact, there's several folks in the chat room that say, Sessler should come to

01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:00.520
vlog.

01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:02.680
I, he is, the door is open.

01:49:02.680 --> 01:49:04.640
I will, I would love to interview Adam Sessler.

01:49:04.640 --> 01:49:05.640
We can't pay you though.

01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:07.280
We'll pay him in Starbucks.

01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:08.280
Exactly.

01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:13.560
He will probably be getting less money than you were beginning with G4.

01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:15.200
Some folks seem to think he could go to Polygon.

01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:19.480
Again, this is all rampant speculation because you know, he just, I don't think he was planning

01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:20.480
on leaving.

01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:23.160
He thought the contracts would go through, but they didn't.

01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:28.280
Polygon of course is that whole kind of Voltron of the guy who used to be the editor in Chiba

01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:33.640
Kotaku and the like three editor guys from Joystiq and a bunch of people all coming together

01:49:33.640 --> 01:49:34.640
for that one.

01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:35.640
So.

01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:36.640
Hmm.

01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:43.880
Anyhow, uh, he's gone and G4 takes one more step away from gaming.

01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:44.880
Moving on.

01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:45.880
Dark Soccer.

01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:48.900
Vel, moving, no we won't pay him in Pinkberry.

01:49:48.900 --> 01:49:49.900
That Pinkberry's for us.

01:49:49.900 --> 01:49:50.900
That's right.

01:49:50.900 --> 01:49:51.900
I'm not giving up my Pinkberry.

01:49:51.900 --> 01:49:52.900
Hell no.

01:49:52.900 --> 01:49:53.900
I'm giving up my portion of Pinkberry.

01:49:53.900 --> 01:49:54.900
You know what?

01:49:54.900 --> 01:49:55.900
He can have the Peach Pinkberry.

01:49:55.900 --> 01:49:59.720
He can have the Peach, all the Peach, and the Lychee shit when it comes back.

01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:00.720
Oh yeah.

01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:02.400
You can have the Lychee too.

01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:08.860
So the Perpetual Testing Initiative DLC for Portal 2 will be available for PC and Mac

01:50:08.860 --> 01:50:15.080
on May 8th and I'm downloading the shit out of it, but there's nothing saying about it

01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:17.600
being on any of the consoles.

01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:18.600
I second that.

01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:24.720
I mean, I haven't redeemed my copy of Portal 2 for the PC on, um, my Steam thing that came

01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:25.720
with the PS3.

01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:28.520
You know, it might've had an expiration date, so you might want to look into that.

01:50:28.520 --> 01:50:29.520
Damn it.

01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:30.520
You better be careful.

01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:31.520
Whatever.

01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:32.520
Um.

01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:33.840
It's like super cheap anyway now.

01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:34.840
Yeah.

01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:40.580
But I'm totally going to be writing a review on that when I download it because, you know,

01:50:40.580 --> 01:50:43.880
my favorite thing to do in Sims, in Sims 3 was build houses.

01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:47.920
Now I'll be building tests.

01:50:47.920 --> 01:50:49.720
Would you like to play a game?

01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:50.920
Oh God.

01:50:50.920 --> 01:50:56.160
So, uh, for Dragon Quest fans, Dragon Quest X, um, which is the Wii...

01:50:56.160 --> 01:50:57.160
Sorry.

01:50:57.160 --> 01:51:00.520
I'm just imagining your dream OLR Studios level.

01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:03.800
With Loki and I in a perpetual fall.

01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:04.800
Oh my God.

01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:07.800
You guys would be the perfect Atlas and Peabody.

01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:09.160
That should be your cosplay as Atlas and Peabody.

01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:12.760
I know who's Atlas.

01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:14.040
Moving on.

01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:21.640
So anyway, um, for Dragon Quest fans, Dragon Quest X, um, which is, uh, the MMO, uh, launching

01:51:21.640 --> 01:51:26.420
in Japan on August 2nd, Squeenix has told everybody.

01:51:26.420 --> 01:51:34.040
It will be for the actual disc is, um, 6980 yen, which is about 86 bucks and it's 20 days

01:51:34.040 --> 01:51:35.120
of free play.

01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:41.160
It will include a USB memory stick for an extra, uh, 2000 yen and, uh, like 23 bucks

01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:42.160
here.

01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:46.840
And, uh, there is going to be a Wii U version, but they have no details on this one.

01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:53.820
The subscription fee is a thousand yen, basically a 1235 in US dollars.

01:51:53.820 --> 01:51:57.400
And that's a 30 day voucher that gives you to play up to three characters.

01:51:57.400 --> 01:52:00.880
Sixty days is 1950, 90 days will be 2,900.

01:52:00.880 --> 01:52:06.480
So somebody was just asking the other day to square a while subscription is square.

01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:10.640
Square Enix had any other MMOs and I forgot about this one, but yeah, Dragon Quest 10,

01:52:10.640 --> 01:52:11.640
no news about it over here.

01:52:11.640 --> 01:52:14.680
Maybe this is probably an E3 thing.

01:52:14.680 --> 01:52:15.680
I don't know the American version.

01:52:15.680 --> 01:52:19.600
I don't think the launch, you know, Dragon Quest is still a big thing here.

01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:21.160
I understand it is in Japan.

01:52:21.160 --> 01:52:24.800
It would be a big thing for launch, but I don't think it is not above square to talk

01:52:24.800 --> 01:52:27.460
about games that are coming out three years from now at E3.

01:52:27.460 --> 01:52:28.960
That is very true.

01:52:28.960 --> 01:52:32.240
So Final Fantasy 13 versus, yes, yes, exactly.

01:52:32.240 --> 01:52:36.860
I get to, Oh God, I hope, I hope versus makes the holiday this year.

01:52:36.860 --> 01:52:39.680
I really want zero to come out over here.

01:52:39.680 --> 01:52:40.680
Oh yeah.

01:52:40.680 --> 01:52:43.080
Cause I want to play the hell out of that.

01:52:43.080 --> 01:52:50.480
So how about my last bit for rapid fire news, Silent Hill Downpour.

01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:56.500
There actually is a patch, there's two patch announcements, one for Silent Hill Downpour

01:52:56.500 --> 01:53:01.040
and then we have Silent Hill HD Collection to fix the frame rate problems and audio syncing

01:53:01.040 --> 01:53:06.860
and downpour and the auto save in the Silent Hill HD Collection and they should be coming

01:53:06.860 --> 01:53:15.040
out and the quote is in the coming weeks, but, uh, there's no patch yet to make a Silent

01:53:15.040 --> 01:53:16.040
Hill HD Collection.

01:53:16.040 --> 01:53:17.040
Good.

01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:18.040
Yeah.

01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:21.360
We should spend a little bit more time on figuring out how fog works.

01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:25.000
Fog is hard.

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:28.400
It's just like, come on Silent Hill.

01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:30.320
Oh, the monsters don't work.

01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:32.560
Well, let's just release it anyways.

01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:35.960
I mean, that's about as integral as the fog.

01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:38.000
The fog is kind of important there.

01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.960
All right, let's go to the FUGL question of the week.

01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:43.560
We've kind of missed this the past couple of weeks, so I think it's time we get to the

01:53:43.560 --> 01:53:44.560
FUGL question.

01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:45.720
I haven't missed it at all.

01:53:45.720 --> 01:53:46.720
Why haven't you missed?

01:53:46.720 --> 01:53:47.720
Are you, are you hating on the FUGL?

01:53:47.720 --> 01:53:48.720
No.

01:53:48.720 --> 01:53:49.720
I'm being a bitch.

01:53:49.720 --> 01:53:53.320
Except, oops, I didn't have the FUGL theme song up tonight.

01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:54.320
Shame on me.

01:53:54.320 --> 01:53:55.320
Fail fired.

01:53:55.320 --> 01:53:58.320
We're hiring Adam Sessler Robbed.

01:53:58.320 --> 01:53:59.320
You guys would fire.

01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:01.960
Exclusive Adam Sessler to replace Rob.

01:54:01.960 --> 01:54:02.960
Here it is.

01:54:02.960 --> 01:54:03.960
There it is.

01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:04.960
FUGL.

01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:09.280
Every week on our Facebook community and our Google Plus community, we ask a question and

01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:10.280
get your answers.

01:54:10.280 --> 01:54:12.400
Combine Facebook and Google and you get FUGL.

01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:14.780
That's why it's our FUGL question of the week.

01:54:14.780 --> 01:54:19.120
Now that Sony has announced their own Smash Brothers style game, should Microsoft start

01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:20.560
working on one?

01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:24.080
Why or why or why not wouldn't this be a good idea?

01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:26.800
If you think it's a good idea, what character would you most want to see in the game?

01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:30.320
We got one answer on Google Plus, so there are people using Google Plus.

01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:34.440
Danny Kaye says, I don't really think they have enough first party games to justify a

01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:35.440
game like that.

01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:36.440
Ah, exactly.

01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:39.400
That's a theme we're seeing quite a bit through some of the answers going over to Facebook

01:54:39.400 --> 01:54:44.320
where we had lots of answers and I love this one from Bobby Blackwolf who posted a link

01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:50.440
to a picture on a NeoGaf forum of what an Xbox Super Smash Brothers game would look

01:54:50.440 --> 01:54:59.960
like and it's just a select screen for Xbox 360 Ultra Heroes Ultimate Fight and it's 15

01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:05.680
different versions of Master Chief, all in different colors and shapes on the select

01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:06.920
screen.

01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:13.920
You know what this is missing though is the female Master Chief with a bow in her hair.

01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:17.920
Mrs. Chief.

01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:22.120
Katsuhiko Janai says, I don't want to play as Microsoft Bob or Clippy.

01:55:22.120 --> 01:55:26.440
See, I like thinking, think outside the box, don't just make it the video games, make it

01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:27.440
all the...

01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:28.440
Clippy would be awesome.

01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:31.680
I'm not thinking outside the Xbox.

01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:34.560
Getting to kick the shit out of Clippy I think would sell...

01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:37.360
Or the damn dog.

01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:38.720
That ugly ass dog.

01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:43.680
You know what character needs to be in the game Rob, seriously, Comic Sans so I can beat

01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:44.680
the shit out of it.

01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:45.680
All right.

01:55:45.680 --> 01:55:49.600
Stan H says, I agree with Blackwolf, Microsoft doesn't have enough first party characters

01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:52.080
to fill a decent sized roster for today's fighting game.

01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:56.320
You need to have at least 15 and I can't think of anyone besides Master Chief and Milo unless

01:55:56.320 --> 01:56:01.320
they have a Kinect that has legs and arms with boxing gloves on.

01:56:01.320 --> 01:56:03.720
I know, that was funny.

01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:08.880
James A says though, I must confess, I'd love to see Joanna Dark in such a game.

01:56:08.880 --> 01:56:09.880
Cameo too.

01:56:09.880 --> 01:56:11.720
So some folks are starting to think of some others.

01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:16.320
Red the Haze says, no, even though Microsoft has a far more popular titles with characters

01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:20.040
like Master Chief, they just don't have as much of a history to draw from like Sony or

01:56:20.040 --> 01:56:23.240
Nintendo since they're relatively new to the console gaming business.

01:56:23.240 --> 01:56:27.360
They have a few recognizable characters to choose from, they have Master Chief, Fable

01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:30.080
Dude, Gears of War characters.

01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:34.680
Another thing, most of the popular characters on the Xbox are from shooter games, throwing

01:56:34.680 --> 01:56:38.200
characters from shooter games into a Smash Brothers type fighting might not go so well

01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:42.280
with the Dude Bro gamers who are primarily in the Xbox shooters.

01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:45.680
Though if they ever made one, I would love to see the President and Vice President from

01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:48.960
Metal Wolf Chaos, that would totally change my mind.

01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:53.760
Now I like what Jim H. said, they really, even if they don't, even if they can muster

01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:56.400
up a roster, they really don't make those kinds of games.

01:56:56.400 --> 01:57:03.360
Maybe an all-star shooter, so like an all-star melee rampage in first person.

01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:09.680
Just call it like a Microsoft capture the flag, I don't know.

01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:10.680
There you go.

01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:12.820
Uh, let's see.

01:57:12.820 --> 01:57:15.440
Now Gio Video goes a different way with this.

01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:19.800
Well considering Nintendo was able to use Sonic and Snake, it doesn't have to be characters

01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:23.280
exclusive to Microsoft, just characters they're willing to pay money for.

01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:28.560
And since there are games like Metal Gear, Final Fantasy 13, Devil May Cry, that have

01:57:28.560 --> 01:57:32.040
come into the Microsoft franchise, I can see them paying for the use of those characters

01:57:32.040 --> 01:57:34.400
as well as Microsoft exclusives.

01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:38.240
Also since it's Microsoft, perhaps a paper clip that fights with well-placed sarcastic

01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:40.120
comments and uses itself like a sword.

01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:44.920
You're also forgetting the fact that there's Xbox Live Arcade, there's plenty of shit on

01:57:44.920 --> 01:57:45.920
Xbox Live Arcade.

01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:46.920
That's true.

01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:52.040
You can do Castle Crashers, you can have, you know, um, what was it, uh...

01:57:52.040 --> 01:57:53.040
You know what's funny?

01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:54.200
Tony B. said that.

01:57:54.200 --> 01:57:59.560
Xbox Arcade characters swap out Master Chief for Bastion, Tim from Brave, Knights from Castle

01:57:59.560 --> 01:58:04.240
Crashers, dude from Plants from Zombies, Splosion Man.

01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:05.360
So there you go.

01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:10.360
Uh, Orangewrite says Microsoft owns Rare, Rare has the Battletoads.

01:58:10.360 --> 01:58:11.360
Think about it.

01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:14.520
President Cat would not work by the way, Tigerclaw, because that...

01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:16.720
Didn't Rare also do Killer Instinct?

01:58:16.720 --> 01:58:17.720
Yes.

01:58:17.720 --> 01:58:19.400
Oh, but Nintendo technically owns that.

01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:21.960
I don't care, let's do a new Battletoads game.

01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:24.400
Fuck any of this other shit, who gives a crap about this?

01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:26.440
Battletoads is the devil.

01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:27.440
I don't care.

01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:29.040
That game's freaking hard.

01:58:29.040 --> 01:58:32.240
Battletoads with like even more, more difficulty.

01:58:32.240 --> 01:58:35.680
And then it had that like level music, the pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft

01:58:35.680 --> 01:58:36.680
pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft

01:58:36.680 --> 01:58:46.360
pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft

01:58:46.360 --> 01:59:03.580
pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft p

01:59:03.580 --> 01:59:07.640
twitter.com slash olr and Milo be terrible too because I have family

01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:13.900
issues and I'm gonna shoot you in the face all right let's get back into some

01:59:13.900 --> 01:59:21.880
other news Loki exclusive no I'm kidding so yes there there's a little bit of

01:59:21.880 --> 01:59:26.980
talk about the next Smash Brothers game no we're not talking about PlayStation

01:59:26.980 --> 01:59:33.160
one for the Wii U and the 3ds and one of the things that they're really pushing

01:59:33.160 --> 01:59:39.040
for is cross support for those two platforms to be able to brawl against

01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:44.620
each other of course you know who wouldn't want to do that it says

01:59:44.620 --> 01:59:48.940
there's a certain dead end we can we come to if we just expand the volume of

01:59:48.940 --> 01:59:54.100
the game us of course I intend to change the direction a little bit as we go the

01:59:54.100 --> 02:00:00.260
key is that there's going to be its dual support for 3ds and Wii U so they're

02:00:00.260 --> 02:00:05.860
gonna have some sort of you know cross play between the platforms which really

02:00:05.860 --> 02:00:10.780
in this day and age is not that big a deal I mean the PSP and PlayStation 3 do

02:00:10.780 --> 02:00:18.620
that the Vita and the PlayStation 3 do that not a huge deal it depends on how

02:00:18.620 --> 02:00:23.140
like you know well integrated it is to you know well you know with that Wii U

02:00:23.140 --> 02:00:27.060
controller being the bottom half of a 3ds I'm pretty sure that they'll be able

02:00:27.060 --> 02:00:31.620
to pull it off I'm still excited about the next Smash Brothers it's a good

02:00:31.620 --> 02:00:35.940
franchise yeah it'll be great to launch the next 3ds or the revision of the 3ds

02:00:35.940 --> 02:00:40.900
it'll probably announce it oh don't give them ideas you jerk ideas they already

02:00:40.900 --> 02:00:46.800
have ideas well nobody could call this idea that's for damn sure this game is

02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:53.620
calling out idea either it's called NBA baller beats hey I thought you know

02:00:53.620 --> 02:00:58.100
music game fans would enjoy this NBA baller beats it is being described as a

02:00:58.100 --> 02:01:02.460
fun high-energy and first-of-its-kind participative the basketball video game

02:01:02.460 --> 02:01:07.740
launching this fall exclusively on connect for the 360 you play this game

02:01:07.740 --> 02:01:16.060
with an actual basketball in your living room it has licensed tracks from artists

02:01:16.060 --> 02:01:19.860
like Kanye West run DMC gorillas hey there you go

02:01:19.860 --> 02:01:25.620
common tiesto so and so much more apparently USA today got their hands on

02:01:25.620 --> 02:01:29.660
the game and say it's a rhythm music game not like a dribbling coach like a

02:01:29.660 --> 02:01:33.700
rhythm music game you bounce the ball to the beat of the music you have a visual

02:01:33.700 --> 02:01:37.060
cue that's a line of basketballs on a musical trail and you have to do

02:01:37.060 --> 02:01:40.620
specific moves like an icon might prepare you for an upcoming basketball

02:01:40.620 --> 02:01:44.540
move also in time with the music you might have to cross over from one hand

02:01:44.540 --> 02:01:50.980
to the other dribble between the legs do a pass fake or a shot fake it's creative

02:01:50.980 --> 02:01:54.260
I got it to give it that but I'm like how in the fuck is this gonna work

02:01:54.260 --> 02:01:57.860
because if you're playing it in your living room how do you bounce a ball on

02:01:57.860 --> 02:02:02.060
your carpet I used to live in a house with hardwood floors but even then I

02:02:02.060 --> 02:02:06.380
don't think my roommate would appreciate me playing this game well apparently

02:02:06.380 --> 02:02:10.460
dribbling is going to be very close to the body because that's the way it is in

02:02:10.460 --> 02:02:16.140
basketball they don't encourage you to dribble at the TV or whatever let's see

02:02:16.140 --> 02:02:22.540
apparently it is possible to play baller beats in a carpeted room it will work

02:02:22.540 --> 02:02:27.900
the ball will work on most services but that doesn't I guess shag rugs won't

02:02:27.900 --> 02:02:31.060
work but the carpet should I don't know what the heck to take from that I feel

02:02:31.060 --> 02:02:35.740
like I should say that's what she said but I I'm sorry it's just like this

02:02:35.740 --> 02:02:41.180
sounds stupid I not that it's an I'll give them props to the fact that it's a

02:02:41.180 --> 02:02:45.860
unique game idea now there's a little trailer here I've got it has been try

02:02:45.860 --> 02:02:50.580
like this before but I think for good reason because it's stupid because it's

02:02:50.580 --> 02:02:55.660
just I don't think this is gonna work well connect I think this is gonna be

02:02:55.660 --> 02:02:59.320
annoying if you're in a goddamn apartment and also especially if you're

02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:05.340
upstairs yes especially if you're upstairs and it's just I mean I was

02:03:05.340 --> 02:03:08.980
looking in this trailer for clips of the game but I don't think I'm gonna see it

02:03:08.980 --> 02:03:15.460
oh wait no there's a guy it's just him in the living room bouncing a ball but

02:03:15.460 --> 02:03:18.900
he doesn't actually shoot the ball I mean you kind of care you fake shooting

02:03:18.900 --> 02:03:23.220
it but which icons gonna indicate the you know me throwing the ball into the

02:03:23.220 --> 02:03:28.580
TV because that's kind of you know a risk hopefully this thing is made out of

02:03:28.580 --> 02:03:34.420
nerve because that's the only way you're gonna like not break your TV how many

02:03:34.420 --> 02:03:44.580
lamps is this game gonna there's no in-game footage at all okay whatever I'm

02:03:44.580 --> 02:03:49.060
sorry but like these games that come out for connect nobody can fucking take this

02:03:49.060 --> 02:03:53.220
shit seriously they'd be honest Majesco hasn't really had a lot of games that

02:03:53.220 --> 02:03:56.620
take the Kinect seriously I think the last game that they released for the

02:03:56.620 --> 02:04:08.500
Kinect was the twister game twister for Kinect yeah no no this port this should

02:04:08.500 --> 02:04:13.260
be an Xbox Live arcade game but it's not pork chocolate you can't get a little

02:04:13.260 --> 02:04:18.460
nerfy ball from Xbox Live arcade nerfy derpy this will be on the aisle right

02:04:18.460 --> 02:04:23.140
next to babysitting mama with the little wee baby that you shove the wiimote up

02:04:23.140 --> 02:04:28.660
yet but that did well it's on sale at Target yeah it didn't cry pork chop and

02:04:28.660 --> 02:04:31.780
chat says my ears are burning at the sound of this ass hattery and that's

02:04:31.780 --> 02:04:35.420
pretty much what most people in the chat room boils down to you know I gotta

02:04:35.420 --> 02:04:41.700
admit I as dumb as this sounds you guys I'm not gonna lie I kind of want to try

02:04:41.700 --> 02:04:48.220
it just to say I did cuz it's not like any other Kinect game I've seen yet I

02:04:48.220 --> 02:04:53.460
guess it's kind of a dance game at its core but if I could do the thing with

02:04:53.460 --> 02:05:00.140
the ball like that guy hey I'd be fly I could get chicks Dark Sakura would buy

02:05:00.140 --> 02:05:12.060
I'd be hot if I could dribble the ball you're becoming whiter knock it off all

02:05:12.060 --> 02:05:16.060
right we're gonna go to the mailbag every week you guys send us emails they

02:05:16.060 --> 02:05:20.580
don't and tell me about the things I shouldn't be doing no they don't mailbag

02:05:20.580 --> 02:05:26.220
at orange lounge radio.com they really don't send anything we have one email

02:05:26.220 --> 02:05:30.300
one email this week I guess everybody just just thought with the network

02:05:30.300 --> 02:05:35.060
switch we wouldn't have time for emails I'm gonna hope that was it so this comes

02:05:35.060 --> 02:05:38.620
from Robert M I was wondering whether Dark Sakura has had a chance to try the

02:05:38.620 --> 02:05:43.460
pinball arcade either the is version or the latest console download although

02:05:43.460 --> 02:05:46.980
video pinball simply can't really compete with the experience of real

02:05:46.980 --> 02:05:51.100
physical tables what her overall impressions were actually I did download

02:05:51.100 --> 02:05:54.540
it I haven't had a chance to play it yet I thought I talked about this on last

02:05:54.540 --> 02:05:59.500
week or the week I have the iOS version yeah and I have I have literally not I

02:05:59.500 --> 02:06:04.600
downloaded it that's it I played it on 360 it's um it's a faithful recreation

02:06:04.600 --> 02:06:09.660
of the tables it's it really is just like the compilations they already put

02:06:09.660 --> 02:06:12.460
out it's just this is kind of a different way of distributing it and I

02:06:12.460 --> 02:06:15.940
think it's some different tables too I was thrilled to be able to play on

02:06:15.940 --> 02:06:20.100
theater magic theater magic so one of the greatest tables ever I could try

02:06:20.100 --> 02:06:23.380
loading it up so to be able to play that and Arabian Nights is that what the

02:06:23.380 --> 02:06:29.100
table is actually called I have another name to it so I always remember this but

02:06:29.100 --> 02:06:33.860
I love theater magic so to be able to play that again is great you know

02:06:33.860 --> 02:06:37.100
there's things I like about pinball FX 2 and there's things I like about this

02:06:37.100 --> 02:06:42.140
game certainly this game has the classic table feel to it and I get to play all

02:06:42.140 --> 02:06:46.540
those old tables and kind of reminisce but I like that pinball FX has you know

02:06:46.540 --> 02:06:51.540
Arabian tales of the Arabian Nights okay good Ripley's believe it or not black

02:06:51.540 --> 02:06:56.460
hole I love black hole theater of magic bride of pin bot you know I used to have

02:06:56.460 --> 02:07:02.620

during the wedding of a local weather reporter that's it oh I'm so glad we

02:07:55.020 --> 02:07:58.500

02:08:24.180 --> 02:08:43.740
entertainment community what a perfect time to segue into the F use of the week

02:08:43.740 --> 02:08:50.060
a few to this thing for not letting me download this however the table pack is

02:08:50.060 --> 02:08:59.860
like five bucks sucker yeah Loki if you the fact that I'm full there's more bread

02:08:59.860 --> 02:09:04.020
sticks if you did the fact that I'll eat that knowledge guy I save room for

know I'm you know I don't care about the whole reorg or whatever I think it's

02:09:18.740 --> 02:09:24.140
gonna be interesting but the fact that I have to actually physically move meaning

02:09:24.140 --> 02:09:29.700
pack up all my shit at my desk into a box let some other mover take it because

02:09:29.700 --> 02:09:36.100
I'm a liability if I move it myself I don't want to move but hey at least the

02:09:36.100 --> 02:09:41.740
new building has a gym hey at least you won't use it movers yeah they normally

02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:47.140

02:09:47.140 --> 02:09:53.660

02:10:01.180 --> 02:10:08.820
right moving on let's get some more news Loki so this is kind of interesting it

02:10:08.820 --> 02:10:15.620
leaked out on the PlayStation Network Store one of the PlayStation 1 classics

02:10:15.620 --> 02:10:21.220
for the Vita it was actually in the European store Buzz Lightyear of Star

02:10:21.220 --> 02:10:30.180
Command was the game it's been pulled so far but however it doesn't work yet it's

02:10:30.180 --> 02:10:35.420
it's like it's missing a patch or something like that but apparently that

02:10:35.420 --> 02:10:40.020
is a very good indicator that they're gonna be having some PlayStation 1 games

02:10:40.020 --> 02:10:43.900
available very soon for the PlayStation Vita thank God I hope they all are

02:10:43.900 --> 02:10:47.740
because that would be that would be a great library to just open my Vita to

02:10:47.740 --> 02:10:51.900
you know Final Fantasy 7 hello yeah what else do I want Castlevania and now you're

02:10:51.900 --> 02:10:55.300
getting some of these through ps2 Silent Hill the original yeah is free right

02:10:55.300 --> 02:10:59.540
now on PlayStation Plus hopefully the plus stuff works on the Vita maybe they

02:10:59.540 --> 02:11:02.580
have to get all that worked out I don't know but yeah I'm looking forward to

02:11:02.580 --> 02:11:07.020
that that's gonna I know it sounds really weird that like you know it's

02:11:07.020 --> 02:11:11.620
like oh I'm excited about old ass 15 year old games on my portable console

02:11:11.620 --> 02:11:16.620
but you know I don't know I just there's a lot of stuff I have now that I didn't

02:11:16.620 --> 02:11:21.340
when my PSP was all the rage and those screens are so big and crystal clear

02:11:21.340 --> 02:11:26.020
like I'm it's most likely something they'll announce at e3 I think I gotta

02:11:26.020 --> 02:11:31.180
wait that long and let I will only accept that if it's a one of those well

02:11:31.180 --> 02:11:36.660
we're gonna be patching the PlayStation 1 titles into the Vita today you know

02:11:36.660 --> 02:11:40.900
how sometimes there's that whole today announcement like what did Microsoft

02:11:40.900 --> 02:11:48.460
have googly eyes on the Kinect today connect that was a googly eyes laser

02:11:48.460 --> 02:11:56.020
pointer you know I liked it better some of that stuff was cute no no I liked it

02:11:56.020 --> 02:12:00.940
better was that the second year we went to e3 2006 mm-hmm and they fucking had

02:12:00.940 --> 02:12:05.020
hey listen you know what I know a lot of you people can't go to e3 so we're gonna

02:12:05.020 --> 02:12:09.340
put some of those demos that are at e3 on your console that was fucking that

02:12:09.340 --> 02:12:13.500
great that was great but they don't do that shit anymore they never do that

02:12:13.500 --> 02:12:17.420
anymore it was like lost planet and I'd play this shit out of that demo over and

02:12:17.420 --> 02:12:21.540
over again and MotoGP but I didn't give a shit about that but at least Capcom

02:12:21.540 --> 02:12:26.820
got it once you know there I mean they should really do that again or as orange

02:12:26.820 --> 02:12:31.020
right in the chat room says Saturn is coming out today things were different

02:12:31.020 --> 02:12:34.460
back then though when the Saturn came out technology wasn't the way it is now

02:12:34.460 --> 02:12:37.860
like I think if they were to do a system launch like that it would be a lot

02:12:37.860 --> 02:12:42.500
different or at least like you know maybe not today but like it's coming out

02:12:42.500 --> 02:12:49.540
next Friday that's like Apple yeah Apple does that works for them all right

02:12:49.540 --> 02:12:53.340
anyhow uh well you just talked about one thing Capcom does right let me tell you

02:12:53.340 --> 02:12:58.980
about something Capcom does very wrong oh that's a long the Megaman franchise

02:12:58.980 --> 02:13:04.060
it is of note and I wanted to bring it up here on the show that the 100,000

02:13:04.060 --> 02:13:09.820
strong for bringing back Megaman Legends 3 actually hit a hundred thousand

02:13:09.820 --> 02:13:15.580
members this week I'm one of them yeah I think I am too so there you go and this

02:13:15.580 --> 02:13:19.860
that is something that the million moms couldn't accomplish the 1 million moms

02:13:19.860 --> 02:13:25.540
against Ellen or whatever dumbass hattery that stuff was so the hundred

02:13:25.540 --> 02:13:29.940
thousand strong for Megaman Legends I liked they set a reasonable goal they

02:13:29.940 --> 02:13:35.260
didn't say millions for a Megaman Legends they said a hundred thousand

02:13:35.260 --> 02:13:37.820
strong for Megaman Legends because getting a million people in your

02:13:37.820 --> 02:13:41.140
Facebook group that's reserved for things like Betty White hosting Saturday

02:13:41.140 --> 02:13:44.460
Night Live and things like that that's you got to get one of those to get a

02:13:44.460 --> 02:13:49.420
million a hundred thousand though is no small feat that's that's great

02:13:49.420 --> 02:13:52.820
hundred thousand strong so important that if you are a member of the group

02:13:52.820 --> 02:13:57.480
and you have not joined the dev room community at part of Capcom mm-hmm make

02:13:57.480 --> 02:14:00.500
sure you do that because that's what Capcom is actually looking at assuming

02:14:00.500 --> 02:14:03.980
that they're actually looking at something maybe this is gonna pressure

02:14:03.980 --> 02:14:10.580
Capcom into an announcement this e3 we'll see well you fans you demanded it

02:14:10.580 --> 02:14:14.500
so we're gonna finally port those games over that we've been promising oh I'm

02:14:14.500 --> 02:14:19.580
sorry that's into Rama in our chat room says sky I know people on that group

02:14:19.580 --> 02:14:24.380
they fucking occupied the Capcom booth at comic-con as hilarious as that

02:14:24.380 --> 02:14:29.220
imagery is that's kind of messed up because the people at the booze manning

02:14:29.220 --> 02:14:32.900
the floor especially at an event like comic-con probably aren't really the

02:14:32.900 --> 02:14:36.940
decision-makers like yeah but the word will get back I guess that's true but I

02:14:36.940 --> 02:14:40.380
don't know if that's exactly the best way to go about doing it to make a scene

02:14:40.380 --> 02:14:47.580
like that but whatever different strokes for different folks I wonder if now

02:14:47.580 --> 02:14:52.160
they're gonna release it and be all like because the fans demanded it this is the

02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:57.980
fan game shit it worked for operation rainfall I go back go back two years ago

02:14:57.980 --> 02:15:00.580
on this show and that whole operation rainfall thing first started we all sat

02:15:00.580 --> 02:15:04.780
here saying hey chance in hell that's gonna work sorry guys look at what

02:15:04.780 --> 02:15:10.220
happened earthbound yet it works we're having to eat our work it worked or game

02:15:10.220 --> 02:15:13.020
stuff decided hey we're in a back well need to bring it over here and then

02:15:13.020 --> 02:15:16.540
another publisher let's say last story let's say it worked for the last story

02:15:16.540 --> 02:15:19.620
well last story was a different publisher Nintendo didn't have anything

02:15:19.620 --> 02:15:22.620
well but it still worked somebody noticed that somebody put it out and

02:15:22.620 --> 02:15:25.660
somebody took the risk that Nintendo wouldn't take and no one fucking

02:15:25.660 --> 02:15:29.340
recognized president cat I mean seriously president cat there was a big

02:15:29.340 --> 02:15:34.740
campaign behind it for a few weeks and then well I'm maybe president cat will

02:15:34.740 --> 02:15:38.100
be a Wii U launch time perhaps we need a hundred thousand strong for president

02:15:38.100 --> 02:15:46.860
can I think we had a good 50 on Twitter 50 period all right moving that's how

02:15:46.860 --> 02:15:51.340
many copies of the game sold in Japan to apparently all right dark Sakura another

02:15:51.340 --> 02:15:57.060
story please well there was a leak yeah I know everything I've talked about so

02:15:57.060 --> 02:16:04.580
far has been leaks but there was video footage out for Rayman legends that was

02:16:04.580 --> 02:16:10.340
a the Wii U version and it showed the how its graphical power the touchscreen

02:16:10.340 --> 02:16:14.980
tablet and the near field communication basically it had everything on there and

02:16:14.980 --> 02:16:20.220
then we had a statement put out by Ubisoft that said yeah this is real and

02:16:20.220 --> 02:16:25.260
they're working on it at the Montpelier is that how it's pronounced studios

02:16:25.260 --> 02:16:30.580
right now and basically they said that yeah it's not the final game don't use

02:16:30.580 --> 02:16:35.480
that as representative but in fact here's actually what they're uh the

02:16:35.480 --> 02:16:39.860
actual statement is I'll just read it an internal video showing images of Rayman

02:16:39.860 --> 02:16:44.200
origin sequel what has leaked over the internet the video was intended as a

02:16:44.200 --> 02:16:48.060
purely internal demonstrate demonstrative video and in no way

02:16:48.060 --> 02:16:51.760
represents the final game the final console or their features the video was

02:16:51.760 --> 02:16:58.260
destined for internal production teams who often create game prototypes with

02:16:58.260 --> 02:17:02.140
work-in-progress development kits Ubisoft confirms the development of Rayman

02:17:02.140 --> 02:17:08.100
legends handled by I guess that's Michelle Ancel and his team in Montpelier

02:17:08.100 --> 02:17:15.860
so that's it well sucks for them that that got out but these things tend to

02:17:15.860 --> 02:17:18.820
happen I don't know why you would create a sizzle reel for a different department

02:17:18.820 --> 02:17:24.300
in your company we have a big company demos yeah I think it's more like

02:17:24.300 --> 02:17:28.980
something that there's gonna show at e3 that kind of could be or it could have

02:17:28.980 --> 02:17:33.860
been an early I mean maybe not the final cut so to speak I could see I have heard

02:17:33.860 --> 02:17:37.620
it would be in case of keeping funding I have heard from people that I know that

02:17:37.620 --> 02:17:42.180
work in development and so forth that they do sometimes these you know because

02:17:42.180 --> 02:17:45.300
when you have these offices all over the place all over the world you do

02:17:45.300 --> 02:17:48.940
sometimes have these pow-wows be it virtually or whatever where folks are

02:17:48.940 --> 02:17:52.460
kind of like this is what we're working on this is what we're working on any

02:17:52.460 --> 02:17:56.900
industry does this in my job it's called best practices I'm a trainer and my

02:17:56.900 --> 02:17:59.380
training department gets together with other training departments we talk about

02:17:59.380 --> 02:18:02.260
what's what's what are we doing right right now what can we learn from you

02:18:02.260 --> 02:18:06.100
guys that's what we do I mean any big company does something like that it's

02:18:06.100 --> 02:18:11.900
not a secret so I think this is just a part of that now they're gonna go with

02:18:11.900 --> 02:18:17.220
other departments about not leaking your yes now that's the meeting that has to

02:18:17.220 --> 02:18:23.380
be held next anyways as I was alluding to earlier in the show this is what's

02:18:23.380 --> 02:18:28.260
wrong with the goddamn industry right there is this whole I'm assuming that

02:18:28.260 --> 02:18:34.320
most people have seen the video and they're talking about you know the Wii U

02:18:34.320 --> 02:18:37.900
integration and stuff like that which is cool you know the whole like oh one

02:18:37.900 --> 02:18:42.020
person's on the Wii U tablet and they're you know moving the platforms or

02:18:42.020 --> 02:18:44.180
whatever it's kind of like how they do it in a little big planet with like the

02:18:44.180 --> 02:18:49.020
move support and the like the original thing although then your few near

02:18:49.020 --> 02:18:53.900
field communication stuff scares me because that shit Skylanders all over

02:18:53.900 --> 02:18:57.860
fucking again I mean it's like oh hey you want Rabbids world place the rabid

02:18:57.860 --> 02:19:02.820
statue on the tablet oh you want to play it with Enzo place the Enzo statue on

02:19:02.820 --> 02:19:06.420
the tablet oh you want hearts of the game place the heart session deposit 25

02:19:06.420 --> 02:19:10.940
cents into your Wii U it's physical DLC is what that shit is and people are

02:19:10.940 --> 02:19:16.460
fucking stupid and will buy the shit I want a statue of a rabbit and you've

02:19:16.460 --> 02:19:20.020
suckered somebody in the purchasing a deep piece of DLC that would have been

02:19:20.020 --> 02:19:24.900
$2 normally but it's a fucking cheap-ass statue that you're gonna pay $8 for not

02:19:24.900 --> 02:19:29.620
gonna lie though if I could like get a cadence statue that would unlock an all

02:19:29.620 --> 02:19:34.220
caden level in Mass Effect I would be all over that I would I would bow down

02:19:34.220 --> 02:19:40.980
to that statue I love you game I'm just saying it it's Nintendo's tried this

02:19:40.980 --> 02:19:45.440
with you know fucking AR cards with Kid Icarus if they're just experimenting

02:19:45.440 --> 02:19:49.540
with this because they saw how successful Skyler's was and Skylanders

02:19:49.540 --> 02:19:54.580
was a franchise that doesn't really exist it has Spyro in it but fuck it's

02:19:54.580 --> 02:19:58.660
not really Spyro anymore and it's not really a Spyro franchise but it's the

02:19:58.660 --> 02:20:03.260
brand-new franchise that with no backing and they sold toys and people were like

02:20:03.260 --> 02:20:07.140
oh my god I need this toy even though it's like what the fuck is this toy I

02:20:07.140 --> 02:20:12.980
mean it's just this new thing but can you imagine if fucking Mario did that if

02:20:12.980 --> 02:20:16.340
there was a Mario game with a bunch of fucking statues it's a get you know

02:20:16.340 --> 02:20:20.020
franchise with an established fan base already and then you're selling all this

02:20:20.020 --> 02:20:26.380
cool shit on top of it that people oh I got to have this stuff or Pokemon oh I

02:20:26.380 --> 02:20:30.460
need all the Pokemon statues so I can unlock them in game can you imagine and

02:20:30.460 --> 02:20:34.980
I know you probably thinking oh that's ridiculous no it's not it's fucking in a

02:20:34.980 --> 02:20:40.100
couple years time is what's gonna happen and then it's gonna get fucking

02:20:40.100 --> 02:20:45.340
ridiculous Ross deal UT in the vog network chat room says calm down Loki

02:20:45.340 --> 02:20:48.420
they're gonna be cash-ins for this you're not gonna see this take off

02:20:48.420 --> 02:20:55.340
long-term act-def says Nintendo already did this with the e-reader but I don't

02:20:55.340 --> 02:20:59.420
think the e-reader necessarily took off it was a neat idea and I I think it was

02:20:59.420 --> 02:21:03.020
a great idea with some of like the stuff they did for Animal Crossing and stuff

02:21:03.020 --> 02:21:07.180
but I mean I was a little different unlocking the Legend of Zelda or Super

02:21:07.180 --> 02:21:11.100
Mario Brothers in a game is pretty cool compared to like you know and how much

02:21:11.100 --> 02:21:15.380
were those cards they weren't them expensive man the old-school Animal

02:21:15.380 --> 02:21:19.620
Crossing on the GameCube did it the best with the whole like old games oh man

02:21:19.620 --> 02:21:24.660
that's such a deal that Nintendo wants you to forget ever happened all right

02:21:24.660 --> 02:21:29.100
so I I got to share this funny comment from Shane cuz I was talking about the

02:21:29.100 --> 02:21:34.420
cadence statues so Shane's in our chat room at the vog network calm oh excuse

02:21:34.420 --> 02:21:38.380
me vog network calm I almost said the old chair who somebody everybody in

02:21:38.380 --> 02:21:41.660
chats waiting for one of us to fuck up tonight and say something old

02:21:41.660 --> 02:21:46.420
Shane says I would buy all those statues talking about the cadence statues all up

02:21:46.420 --> 02:21:52.940
before you could even see one Rob can I tell you a funny story about Shane we

02:21:52.940 --> 02:21:58.380
were talking in the car while I was on my way I this week I drove to LA at

02:21:58.380 --> 02:22:04.260
midnight I drove to LA from midnight to 5 a.m. I had Victoria with me but I had

02:22:04.260 --> 02:22:07.820
to drive to stock to the Stockton area to pick Victoria up from Sacramento she

02:22:07.820 --> 02:22:10.160
lives in a town called Livermore for those of you guys familiar with

02:22:10.160 --> 02:22:12.880
California so it's about an hour and a half away from where I'm at so I'm

02:22:12.880 --> 02:22:15.700
driving down there about 10 o'clock at night and I call Shane on the road just

02:22:15.700 --> 02:22:18.420
you know I'm like Shane entertain me so he's talking about I'm trying to pick

02:22:18.420 --> 02:22:22.580
out a new gamertag and I can't think of I can't think of what gamertag to pick

02:22:22.580 --> 02:22:25.020
out cuz I want a new gamertag and I asked him if I could share this with you

02:22:25.020 --> 02:22:29.820
guys and I said well Shane you need to just put something you really love in

02:22:29.820 --> 02:22:34.620
your gamertag he's like I can't get Caden everything everything Caden is

02:22:34.620 --> 02:22:40.380
taken I said why don't you make your gamertag Shane a lingo like you've

02:22:40.380 --> 02:22:43.620
married cuz Caden's name is a lingo I said why don't you make your gamertag

02:22:43.620 --> 02:22:47.660
Shane a lingo and he's like I'm gonna do that yes and he changed his gamertag so

02:22:47.660 --> 02:22:57.340
he's now Shane a lingo he took Caden's name what Cadence no that doesn't work

02:22:57.660 --> 02:23:03.540
all right anyhow there it is that was your random tangent story hey two more

02:23:03.540 --> 02:23:06.940
stories which is a lot more interesting than your grocery store dance thank you

02:23:06.940 --> 02:23:11.380
thank you shut up all right two more stories and then Twitter and Skype well

02:23:11.380 --> 02:23:17.620
this is an unusual chain of events apparently Nexon is looking to take

02:23:17.620 --> 02:23:25.460
over EA they're actually bidding to buy EA apparently they're really big in South

02:23:25.460 --> 02:23:30.580
Korea and they have a lot of money I don't think that they're actually gonna

02:23:30.580 --> 02:23:39.540
take them over but it's interesting that they're trying it's kind of funny that

02:23:39.540 --> 02:23:44.340
somebody's like trying to take on EA but everybody's laughing kind of pointing

02:23:44.340 --> 02:23:47.260
laughing that's going how cute and you're just waiting for it to flip the

02:23:47.260 --> 02:23:56.300
other way why don't we buy you always a bigger fish who do you think could buy

02:23:56.300 --> 02:24:03.140
EA if anyone Microsoft Sony I guess I mean who's bigger than EA at this point

02:24:03.140 --> 02:24:06.660
in the gaming why would they want to like a Viacom or something like that to

02:24:06.660 --> 02:24:10.740
stop EA from all this multi-platform online stuff they're trying to do and

02:24:10.740 --> 02:24:15.140
lock EA and all their games into one particular system I can't imagine

02:24:15.140 --> 02:24:20.660
Microsoft event key oh yeah hey sports games we have them no one else says

02:24:20.660 --> 02:24:26.540
Facebook is gonna pay 1 billion dollars for Instagram surely there's a way if

02:24:26.540 --> 02:24:31.860
Microsoft wants it bad enough they could snap up EA and every every EA exclusive

02:24:31.860 --> 02:24:37.380
is now Microsoft exclusive including the sports franchises Mass Effect Dragon Age

02:24:37.380 --> 02:24:40.140
I'm thinking of all the Bioware stuff is this the stuff I like but you know all

02:24:40.140 --> 02:24:46.740
the battlefield battlefield I mean but because of that EA probably just cost

02:24:46.740 --> 02:24:53.340
too damn much yeah team Ron in our chat room says Ted Turner should buy EA Ted

02:24:53.340 --> 02:24:59.140
Turner actually they tried to do gaming Turner was game tap turn the Turner

02:24:59.140 --> 02:25:02.500
Network stuff started game tap back in the day back when game tap was alright

02:25:02.500 --> 02:25:06.140
game tap was really interesting when it finally they could come back if they

02:25:06.140 --> 02:25:09.380
really yeah I kind of went to crap since the beginning like it just now it just

02:25:09.380 --> 02:25:12.100
blends in with the rest when it had kind of like its own player and they were

02:25:12.100 --> 02:25:15.700
talking about like the desktop stuff and all that and had its own launcher it was

02:25:15.700 --> 02:25:19.740
really neat looking now it's just it just looks like any other it just it

02:25:19.740 --> 02:25:22.500
blends right in with everything else like what game flies doing and all that

02:25:22.500 --> 02:25:27.780
other stuff so and plus for a while game tap was like the only place you could

02:25:27.780 --> 02:25:30.780
play missed online some of that other stuff you should come out with the

02:25:30.780 --> 02:25:35.420
console it'll be a PC from like ten years ago they'll the old stuff maybe

02:25:35.420 --> 02:25:40.860
who knows hey what do we do these old PCs they kind of I've got an idea don't

02:25:40.860 --> 02:25:46.580
you see that happen with the NES stuff like you see those are the the oh yeah

02:25:46.580 --> 02:25:51.660
like you know 101 built into the NES because all the patents on the old NES

02:25:51.660 --> 02:25:56.300
stuff is expired the actual hardware pirates don't give a fuck yeah exactly

02:25:56.300 --> 02:26:00.100
well and Nintendo doesn't really protect it very well either I don't know if they

02:26:00.100 --> 02:26:06.620
can't or what the deal is but let's see DJ Dark Knight in our chair and says

02:26:06.620 --> 02:26:11.940
totally forgot about game tap lol yeah that's game taps problem they used to

02:26:11.940 --> 02:26:15.860
have really funny commercials and the reason why was because they had Turner

02:26:15.860 --> 02:26:21.980
Network behind them so they had the the ability to do some fun TV stuff sake in

02:26:21.980 --> 02:26:27.180
our chat room hi sake says yep game tap resurrected missed online or ooh was the

02:26:27.180 --> 02:26:31.860
name of that I did I missed online was creepy this is kind of a creepy game to

02:26:31.860 --> 02:26:35.540
me by the way since I say eggs and chat I should say everybody check out walking

02:26:35.540 --> 02:26:40.020
dead just came out I think say would appreciate me throwing that out there

02:26:40.020 --> 02:26:44.140
all right one more story for you guys and then the skype line at one eight

02:26:44.140 --> 02:26:51.740
seven seven game olr or our username on skype orange lounge radio this is a new

02:26:51.740 --> 02:26:58.700
story about an old game that's new again what do I mean by that well 30 years

02:26:58.700 --> 02:27:03.140
after the fact something that was supposed to be impossible has finally

02:27:03.140 --> 02:27:10.100
happened the game star castle has been condensed onto an Atari 2600 cartridge

02:27:10.100 --> 02:27:16.780
that's right remember the game star castle nope well somebody does I actually

02:27:16.780 --> 02:27:19.580
I think it was a pretty big game in the 80s but because it never had a home port

02:27:19.580 --> 02:27:23.300
I think a lot of people forgot it well what's interesting Howard Scott Warshaw

02:27:23.300 --> 02:27:28.060
who made you know yards revenge et love him or hate him he made some great games

02:27:28.060 --> 02:27:33.540
and some bad games on the Atari 2600 he said star castle could never be stuffed

02:27:33.540 --> 02:27:37.260
into a game cartridge that's why they never did it because they just there was

02:27:37.260 --> 02:27:41.700
no way they could have done it in 8k well Scott Williamson who was one of

02:27:41.700 --> 02:27:44.500
these guys back in the day that was doing stuff for the 2600 he never

02:27:44.500 --> 02:27:50.220
believed it so here we are 30 years later I love this this is like something

02:27:50.220 --> 02:27:56.580
Loki would do don't you ever tell me I can't do something because damn it

02:27:56.580 --> 02:28:03.380
someday I'm gonna fucking do it here we are 30 years later and Scott Williamson

02:28:03.380 --> 02:28:09.580
achieved it he got star castle down into a format for the Atari 2600 he is now

02:28:09.580 --> 02:28:13.820
the technical director at development studio high voltage what I think is

02:28:13.820 --> 02:28:19.020
really cool though they made this custom cartridge and I actually really love

02:28:19.020 --> 02:28:22.540
this there's a great YouTube where you can check this out the frickin cartridge

02:28:22.540 --> 02:28:27.980
lights up they built these little lights into the cartridge so that as you're

02:28:27.980 --> 02:28:31.180
playing it I'm trying to get to like a part where you see it in the video here

02:28:31.180 --> 02:28:34.300
because I don't want to play the whole like two and a half minute video it's

02:28:34.300 --> 02:28:38.940
pretty cool yeah oh yeah the game looks great but there's a part in it where you

02:28:38.940 --> 02:28:42.820
actually see the little cartridge is like lighting up with the game it's

02:28:42.820 --> 02:28:46.060
technology like at the time oh my god can you imagine if somebody had done

02:28:46.060 --> 02:28:50.900
this when Atari 2600 was like new yeah oh there it is here look at this part

02:28:50.900 --> 02:28:56.860
here in the video see like it's lighting up with the game and you can actually

02:28:56.860 --> 02:29:01.140
buy that cartridge you can and if you want to get a copy of the cartridge you

02:29:01.140 --> 02:29:03.940
know they're trying to fund an effort right now to get that cartridge made

02:29:03.940 --> 02:29:07.380
they want to make a lot of these and sell these so where does everybody go

02:29:07.380 --> 02:29:12.500
and they need money fast in this day and age kick-farter that's right it's a kick

02:29:12.500 --> 02:29:19.380
farter so if you go to Kickstarter it's the Atari 2600 star castle I gotta say

02:29:19.380 --> 02:29:25.260
this one's I I like this better than a lot of the ones I've read the goal is

02:29:25.260 --> 02:29:29.940
reasonable $10,000 and $10,000 they've already met it with 24 days to go

02:29:29.940 --> 02:29:33.940
they're already at $14,000 and if you want to get a copy of the cartridge I

02:29:33.940 --> 02:29:38.780
think it's $50 or more yeah yeah pledge $50 you get the clear cast acrylic star

02:29:38.780 --> 02:29:43.300
castle cartridge featuring lights that flash with the game action serial number

02:29:43.300 --> 02:29:48.140
and and so forth that's one of the few that I can get behind I mean it sounds

02:29:48.140 --> 02:29:53.220
pretty cool just for the fact that I'd be buying the actual cartridge I am

02:29:53.220 --> 02:29:56.660
forever more they're going to refer to those things as kick-farters that's a

02:29:56.660 --> 02:30:02.260
great name I am so against them except if they give me money I don't know man

02:30:02.260 --> 02:30:07.180
I I've contributed to two and both are pretty good video game high school and

02:30:07.180 --> 02:30:12.740
shadowrun because I like me some shadowrun and Freddie Wong man whatever

02:30:12.740 --> 02:30:19.220
whatever he makes it wants money for I'll pay for it all right I think that's

02:30:19.220 --> 02:30:22.700
about the time where we're gonna open up the skype line die oh yeah I have Skype

02:30:22.700 --> 02:30:27.340
open I just had us on D&D so let me unlock that there and we're gonna cast

02:30:27.340 --> 02:30:34.420
magic missile it's open it's on D&D right one do not disturb 1 8 7 you're a

02:30:34.420 --> 02:30:40.180
little disturbing all right oh you have a last minute story go for it I was

02:30:40.180 --> 02:30:45.260
interested in awesomenauts it turns out that their publisher DTP entertainment

02:30:45.260 --> 02:30:49.040
filed for as they say overseas insolvency which is pretty much the

02:30:49.040 --> 02:30:56.660
equivalent of bankruptcy so it may not make them a second really state but um

02:30:56.660 --> 02:31:00.980
Romano games which is the developers really trying to work on getting it out

02:31:00.980 --> 02:31:05.420
so so I'm looking at our chat room at chat owners on traded calm I noticed

02:31:05.420 --> 02:31:09.020
sake is suddenly getting an impromptu interview in the chat room because

02:31:09.020 --> 02:31:11.660
people are like saying did you work on walking dead that was awesome because

02:31:11.660 --> 02:31:14.940
apparently walk I have not played it myself yet because I haven't watched the

02:31:14.940 --> 02:31:18.380
show although I understand the game is based off the books I do still want to

02:31:18.380 --> 02:31:22.020
check it out because I hear it's really good everybody's really loving the game

02:31:22.020 --> 02:31:27.820
so sake is giving an impromptu interview at vog network calm and I want to

02:31:27.820 --> 02:31:31.540
mention what Blackwell says in the chat room $50 is about how much you'd be

02:31:31.540 --> 02:31:35.580
paying for a custom 2600 cartridge anyway so that's a decent price I paid

02:31:35.580 --> 02:31:41.340
40 bucks for halo 2600 somebody actually did halo 2600 all right mm-hmm let's go

02:31:41.340 --> 02:31:45.820
to the phones hi you are on orange launch radio who's this this is Shane

anyway Shane what did you really want to call it about um I was thinking about

02:32:21.300 --> 02:32:26.480
those rumors of the midnight purple 3ds since it's popping up all over the place

02:32:26.480 --> 02:32:31.580
on a room like online sites it's not a rumor they have a picture of it well

02:32:31.580 --> 02:32:36.380
because it was 83 as one of the concept colors a long time ago I wasn't well it

02:32:36.380 --> 02:32:41.340
might not be that specific color it could be slightly changed do I if that

02:32:41.340 --> 02:32:47.380
if if that color comes out that will be the first time I will ever as I call it

02:32:47.380 --> 02:32:55.420
quote pull a Shane and buy a $250 system just because it's in a nice new color

02:32:55.420 --> 02:33:00.220
I will I'm gonna upgrade if that's the case because I can't tell the difference

02:33:00.220 --> 02:33:06.100
between blue and purple so to me it's a new blue system for me I'm really happy

02:33:06.100 --> 02:33:11.860
with that but wouldn't that make it all the less I don't know likely they would

02:33:11.860 --> 02:33:16.940
announce a redesign at e3 for the 3ds no no because they were still releasing

02:33:16.940 --> 02:33:20.820
even after the DSI XL came out they released the DSI and like pretty pink

02:33:20.820 --> 02:33:26.460
and all this stuff so not necessarily plus I it may still be too soon this

02:33:26.460 --> 02:33:31.260
year still may be too soon for the redesign the 3ds is only a year old I

02:33:31.260 --> 02:33:34.100
see this is the kind of thing that's in a two-year cycle and also because

02:33:34.100 --> 02:33:37.020
they're trying to make sure that they're not losing more money on they're adding

02:33:37.020 --> 02:33:41.140
more components to a system might not be a good idea yeah this year is about the

02:33:41.140 --> 02:33:44.780
Wii U I don't think I mean certainly they still want people to buy the 3ds

02:33:44.780 --> 02:33:49.380
but I don't do a 3ds XL with the extra add-on built in I just don't think they

02:33:49.380 --> 02:33:53.820
would do a 3ds XL or whatever and owe the Wii U in the same year I think this

02:33:53.820 --> 02:33:58.020
year will be the Wii U next year will be their 3ds redesign year after that

02:33:58.020 --> 02:34:03.140
something some huge add-on for the Wii U or something okay then what about this

02:34:03.140 --> 02:34:08.940
what game are they going to launch that makes that color make sense what purple

02:34:08.940 --> 02:34:13.780
yeah because they tend to launch games that kind of fit with the new color

02:34:13.780 --> 02:34:20.660
schemes like they had in Japan they had the Fire Emblem blue they've had stuff

02:34:20.660 --> 02:34:25.940
similar to that I don't know I can't think my Pokemon purple no Luigi's

02:34:25.940 --> 02:34:32.300
Mansion 2 or Animal Crossing while Luigi takes over the world because he was

02:34:32.300 --> 02:34:37.420
purple right yeah maybe he's in crappy Luigi's Mansion 2 very hopefully is

02:34:37.420 --> 02:34:43.020
better than that e3 demo I played there you go or what else what else is purple

02:34:43.020 --> 02:34:50.540
Barney the Barney the dinosaur he's coming back you know well maybe maybe

02:34:50.540 --> 02:34:53.980
the license on Barney now that it's been 20 years is so cheap maybe somebody else

02:34:53.980 --> 02:34:57.820
is licensed them and now we can finally get our Barney killer game Barney

02:34:57.820 --> 02:35:04.620
sniper so 90s already Barney 20 years after nobody hold on hold on hold on are

02:35:04.620 --> 02:35:08.580
you all sitting here and telling me that if some company released a game called

02:35:08.580 --> 02:35:12.660
birthday party Barney sniper you would not be the least bit interest no I would

02:35:12.660 --> 02:35:16.940
not be actually no I am so over that excuse me excuse me

02:35:16.940 --> 02:35:21.060
Shane this whole wood cars about life if you try should we be like talk to the

02:35:21.060 --> 02:35:25.620
hand because that's another stupid 90s reference no excuse me because what are

02:35:25.620 --> 02:35:29.380
you talking about no one cares about stuff in the 90s with your Power Rangers

02:35:29.380 --> 02:35:34.100
obsession different because that's not different you know what came on after

02:35:34.100 --> 02:35:39.900
Barney Power Rangers I think if it's fair to share or repeat something again

02:35:39.900 --> 02:35:44.740
but they are doing a Power Rangers samurai connect game they'll be coming

02:35:44.740 --> 02:35:48.140
I told people at work that also care about Power Rangers and they all freaked

02:35:48.140 --> 02:35:53.180
out about that just like I did so that worked there at least before people that

02:35:53.180 --> 02:35:59.540
buy that game well there you go and that's all the copies that will sell

02:35:59.540 --> 02:36:02.820
that's more people than bought president cat in Japan all right

02:36:02.820 --> 02:36:07.140
Shane what else anything else you want to share with us tonight or ask about or

02:36:07.140 --> 02:36:12.820
whatever I don't know my I hurts oh no but here let me ask you about this since

02:36:12.820 --> 02:36:17.060
you're the guy that always likes to talk about Mass Effect yes I am um what did

02:36:17.060 --> 02:36:20.540
you think about my little negative aspect of Mass Effect 3 some people in

02:36:20.540 --> 02:36:24.300
the chat room didn't take too well to that I wait what was you know say it one

02:36:24.300 --> 02:36:28.800
more time for me because I don't know if I fully grasp what I don't like tension

02:36:28.800 --> 02:36:34.060
that it's not that I hate that you have to play multiplayer in order to do

02:36:34.060 --> 02:36:37.900
better in single-player especially in light of the whole iOS thing but I

02:36:37.900 --> 02:36:41.300
really hate that a it's the easiest way to do it and B what really pisses me off

02:36:41.300 --> 02:36:45.220
is the fact that you can buy those little boxes with Microsoft points as

02:36:45.220 --> 02:36:49.420
well as in-game credits because to me that's trying to it's trying to have

02:36:49.420 --> 02:36:54.280
your cake and eat it too you're trying to do a free Facebook game and charge me

02:36:54.280 --> 02:37:00.020
$60 for the game up front I didn't like about I don't really agree with your

02:37:00.020 --> 02:37:07.100
negativity because a if there are people that want to pay real money to unlock

02:37:07.100 --> 02:37:12.420
extra guns or extra customization on their characters instead of just playing

02:37:12.420 --> 02:37:16.540
through the modes like you should let them they're not making me pay for it so

02:37:16.540 --> 02:37:19.700
I don't really care I'm saying please don't do it because you're encouraging

02:37:19.700 --> 02:37:23.060
him to do it in other stuff and more often I just I think it's a bad

02:37:23.060 --> 02:37:27.220
precedent is that if these people don't do it someone else will it's already out

02:37:27.220 --> 02:37:30.580
there with like you know it's half out there rather with like all those

02:37:30.580 --> 02:37:34.380
Facebook games oh I could play there's a um that you don't know Jack game

02:37:34.380 --> 02:37:38.060
apparently on Facebook is in beta and it's apparently really fun but you only

02:37:38.060 --> 02:37:42.820
get like five games per day and they're really short unless you buy you know

02:37:42.820 --> 02:37:46.940
credits or something wait a minute you don't know Jack is on Facebook it's in

02:37:46.940 --> 02:37:51.380
beta right now I know what I'm doing after the show or has it I knew what I'm

02:37:51.380 --> 02:37:54.860
doing after the show nope you have to sign up for the beta I haven't got in

02:37:54.860 --> 02:37:59.260
since I damn it up yet yes I know I once I heard about I was like sign me up

02:37:59.260 --> 02:38:08.780
really quick but to even if there wasn't an iOS game to help you raise your

02:38:08.780 --> 02:38:13.660
galactic readiness level like I hated the idea of having to play multiplayer

02:38:13.660 --> 02:38:19.500
just to get a quote-unquote better ending because they all suck but like

02:38:19.500 --> 02:38:23.340
the multiplayer is so enjoyable and you don't have to listen to other people if

02:38:23.340 --> 02:38:26.380
you don't want to and you just run around I'm terrible at the Xbox when I

02:38:26.380 --> 02:38:30.380
get killed all the time but I don't care I'm still having a blast playing it so I

02:38:30.380 --> 02:38:35.460
think if it was a multiplayer that sucked yeah then boo to that but they

02:38:35.460 --> 02:38:40.220
did a really good job and I don't think it's that big of an issue that you

02:38:40.220 --> 02:38:44.140
should play multiplayer to have a better ending because you can take those

02:38:44.140 --> 02:38:48.340
characters and use them as I think war assets once they hit 20 or something

02:38:48.340 --> 02:38:52.080
like that and speaking of which since you brought it up I believe after the

02:38:52.080 --> 02:38:55.860
show tonight we're gonna be playing some Mass Effect online right yes we are did

02:38:55.860 --> 02:38:58.860
you did you get people can join us did you get some I thought you were in try

02:38:58.860 --> 02:39:03.060
and recruit somebody to play with us nope can't play tonight that person so

02:39:03.060 --> 02:39:07.920
you need to you need to send out like some sort of whatever you call it all

02:39:07.920 --> 02:39:14.300
right get on Xbox hold on show Mass Effect 3 meet up there you go yes all

02:39:14.300 --> 02:39:18.540

oh well it was fun trying well I doubt it you guys do a pretty good job anyway

02:40:04.740 --> 02:40:08.460
you know this is important to say when we started orange launch radio in the

02:40:08.460 --> 02:40:13.860
old network I think you can you know I can't say this enough we did orange

02:40:13.860 --> 02:40:19.180
launch radio for 12 people for a very long time you know and a lot of people

02:40:19.180 --> 02:40:22.220
really didn't know about us and it's not like we have thousands of thousands of

02:40:22.220 --> 02:40:26.380
listeners now it's relatively still a really small show but we're okay with

02:40:26.380 --> 02:40:30.020
that you know we feel like we're really connected with our community and it's

02:40:30.020 --> 02:40:35.220
it's cool I like it suppose it's very dedicated kind of community as well so I

02:40:35.220 --> 02:40:41.420
mean I like this and so I guess you got me staying up till all hours so well

02:40:41.420 --> 02:40:45.500
that is a great I'm not too much because I can't talk over you all the time so

02:40:45.500 --> 02:40:48.820
that's right I was just gonna say when you sacrifice the greatness that is

02:40:48.820 --> 02:40:53.540
sleep to listen to this show we take it as a great compliment but anyway what

02:40:53.540 --> 02:40:57.060
did you want to talk to our talk about or ask us about tonight I wanted to

02:40:57.060 --> 02:41:00.440
mention remember you're talking about six axes one of the games that was

02:41:00.440 --> 02:41:04.220
pretty overlooked I don't know if many people bought it was loco roko I remember

02:41:04.220 --> 02:41:08.820
buying that on PSN and I played the shit out of that I mean on PSP it was okay

02:41:08.820 --> 02:41:13.260
but you know you could actually control everything with the six axis you could

02:41:13.260 --> 02:41:17.820
rotate the screen you could turn everything around and stuff so I mean

02:41:17.820 --> 02:41:22.500
that was one of the best ones I think I did was that a gun that went off in the

02:41:22.500 --> 02:41:33.100
background it was my Android okay I'm actually talking okay it was a duck

02:41:33.100 --> 02:41:38.660
quite they have ducks over there no loco roko is is pretty awesome you're

02:41:38.660 --> 02:41:41.900
right I forgot about loco roko and that's a good one to remind us of does

02:41:41.900 --> 02:41:45.780
this mean hey does this mean loco roko needs to show up in the Sony Super

02:41:45.780 --> 02:41:53.540
Battle Royale a loco roko level that's a good idea that I want them yes that

02:41:53.540 --> 02:41:58.900
would be hilarious you're actually able to flip the screen somehow oh everyone

02:41:58.900 --> 02:42:02.900
on their heads do pork chops should be designing games I love that idea the

02:42:02.900 --> 02:42:06.900
whole like flip the screen like get a power-up that does that oh that'd be

02:42:06.900 --> 02:42:11.420
awesome sorry be awesome well pork chop are you looking forward to the super

02:42:11.420 --> 02:42:15.900
Sony fighter or whatever it's called I'm in two minds about it I mean this the

02:42:15.900 --> 02:42:19.500
first I've heard of it was tonight so I'm still thinking about it I'm

02:42:19.500 --> 02:42:22.740
wondering is it gonna be worthwhile I mean it's not gonna be Super Smash

02:42:22.740 --> 02:42:26.860
Brothers that was fun and again I mean as long as Microsoft don't try it I mean

02:42:26.860 --> 02:42:32.020
that's gonna be an all-time piece of shit if you ask me it's just gonna be 12

02:42:32.020 --> 02:42:37.820
Master Chief's as it was said in chat so well we'll see we'll see what happens

02:42:37.820 --> 02:42:40.820

exciting for both yeah I mean I just hope that all games looking go the

02:43:39.220 --> 02:43:44.900
direction of g4 no I can tell you know what I I think I can safely say no there

02:43:44.900 --> 02:43:48.740
I am fairly certain they have no interest in rerunning cheaters or cops

02:43:48.740 --> 02:43:54.140
yes I from what I understand there's some other great gaming and gaming

02:43:54.140 --> 02:43:58.860
related programming coming over there that that'll be great and you know that's

02:43:58.860 --> 02:44:06.060
I'll be I'll be listening when I can it'll be interesting hey I'm just on a

02:44:06.060 --> 02:44:09.540
technical note notice I've been getting some feedback when I'm talking I've been

02:44:09.540 --> 02:44:14.340
hearing like pieces of myself you might yeah because in studio here we're too

02:44:14.340 --> 02:44:17.180
cheap to have headsets for everybody so we actually play the calls over the

02:44:17.180 --> 02:44:21.020
speaker so sometimes you get picked up just a little bit by our microphones so

02:44:21.020 --> 02:44:25.540
sometimes our callers complain of that so apologies about that but you know one

02:44:25.540 --> 02:44:29.500
of these days we'll have to go I don't know sell things on the side of the

02:44:29.500 --> 02:44:33.320
freeway to get money for proper headphones for everybody actually that

02:44:33.320 --> 02:44:36.220
was something I thought about doing for the studio but just never got around to

02:44:36.220 --> 02:44:42.020
it but anyway I do yeah that might be a good idea I mean it's not like I get

02:44:42.020 --> 02:44:45.620
office headsets or something well the good news is it's only you that has to

02:44:45.620 --> 02:44:51.000
hear it are the over the radio it sounds fine and so I kind of go okay well one

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:54.660
person can suffer a little bit so all the others listening can hear it okay so

02:44:54.660 --> 02:45:03.780
I apologize so games what's up what games you've been playing lately or was

02:45:03.780 --> 02:45:07.620
there game news you want to mention tonight well lately I've been playing a

02:45:07.620 --> 02:45:12.900
lot of Soul Caliber five Soul Caliber five yeah one of our listeners and I

02:45:12.900 --> 02:45:16.060
were trying to meet up to play and it just wasn't working out for various

02:45:16.060 --> 02:45:21.300
reasons but man some of the custom creations and I think he posted some of

02:45:21.300 --> 02:45:25.980
them on Facebook Stan posted it on Facebook it's it's hilarious what people

02:45:25.980 --> 02:45:29.500
are doing with those custom characters it's so robust but yeah so Caliber five

02:45:29.500 --> 02:45:34.740
yeah time oh yeah I saw this one video on YouTube it was a Waldo player uh-huh

02:45:34.740 --> 02:45:40.060
and and he made this character based off of Waldo with a huge purple furry

02:45:40.060 --> 02:45:48.540
palace because and I got the episode yeah it's the only like and sorry I was

02:45:48.540 --> 02:45:51.700
just gonna say something go ahead that's right it's old classic saying that we

02:45:51.700 --> 02:45:55.740
say about video games it's called time to penis whenever something new comes

02:45:55.740 --> 02:45:59.860
as the TTP the time to penis whenever something new comes out where there's

02:45:59.860 --> 02:46:04.100
either a peripheral so for a peripheral it's how long till someone puts their

02:46:04.100 --> 02:46:08.660
dick on it but then with these creative modes and custom things it's how long

02:46:08.660 --> 02:46:14.500
till someone makes a dick and the answer is usually 0.5 seconds oh yeah it was

02:46:14.500 --> 02:46:17.860
not long at all I think the YouTube video was like from February so it's

02:46:17.860 --> 02:46:20.660
like very soon after the game came out it's not long at all that's what she

02:46:20.660 --> 02:46:29.940
said I mean the thing that I'm sorry I'm laughing a bit but um the thing that's

02:46:29.940 --> 02:46:34.620
got me about um instead of been playing a lot of phone caliber is that you know

02:46:34.620 --> 02:46:39.500
it's very hard to define you know fighting coverage that isn't really

02:46:39.500 --> 02:46:44.260
centered around Capcom you know it's gotten to the point where I don't know

02:46:44.260 --> 02:46:47.860
if you follow tournaments at all but it really feels like you know a lot of the

02:46:47.860 --> 02:46:52.700
players are forcing themselves with them with Street Fighter cross second because

02:46:52.700 --> 02:46:56.260
you know playing the Capcom game seems to be the only game way to get any

02:46:56.260 --> 02:47:02.060
coverage interesting so you think Namco is getting well I mean I guess maybe not

02:47:02.060 --> 02:47:05.020
because Namco is kind of the other half of Street Fighter cross tech and

02:47:05.020 --> 02:47:11.260
although technically it's a Capcom game what about what about Mortal Kombat are

02:47:11.260 --> 02:47:14.140
people not taking that seriously I mean Mortal Kombat I thought was a pretty

02:47:14.140 --> 02:47:18.340
good fighting game but I guess it is the thing is people people play these games

02:47:18.340 --> 02:47:23.780
seriously I mean maybe not as much if there are a lot of people I mean um you

02:47:23.780 --> 02:47:27.340
know so kind of a five in Mortal Kombat 9 are part of the games being featured

02:47:27.340 --> 02:47:32.340
in major league gaming now but you know it's hard to find coverage if it's not a

02:47:32.340 --> 02:47:37.460
bypass on game so it's hard to find you know people talking about it people you

02:47:37.460 --> 02:47:40.420
know any sort of cup you know any sort of coverage of the events of things like

02:47:40.420 --> 02:47:44.660
that why do you think that is you know the as you're saying that you're kind of

02:47:44.660 --> 02:47:47.900
right whenever I hear about fighting game community it does seem like Capcom

02:47:47.900 --> 02:47:52.060
first other games second I mean granted there are other games like Stan says

02:47:52.060 --> 02:47:55.220
King of Fighters which is another good one to you know Soul Calibur as was

02:47:55.220 --> 02:47:57.820
mentioned it's not like there's not other good fighting games out there but

02:47:57.820 --> 02:48:00.420
you're kind of right whenever I hear about like fighting game tournaments and

02:48:00.420 --> 02:48:03.860
who's popular it's always Street Fighter something that it comes down to why is

02:48:03.860 --> 02:48:09.940
that why do you think that is I mean it's hard hell I mean obviously part of

02:48:09.940 --> 02:48:14.380
it is because you know one of the first big fighting games was Street Fighter 2

02:48:14.380 --> 02:48:20.860
I mean that that's the jump off for a lot of players true but I think at this

02:48:20.860 --> 02:48:27.700
point you have a you have a lot of major sites that really they didn't know it's

02:48:27.700 --> 02:48:31.260
like anything else they don't want to go out of their wheelhouse and it and it's

02:48:31.260 --> 02:48:34.780
kind of frustrating we have to dig around for for science but for other

02:48:34.780 --> 02:48:39.820
games I have to tell you though my experience was a lot different when I

02:48:39.820 --> 02:48:45.900
was you know teenager and young adult in Alabama it was all Mortal Kombat 2 it was

02:48:45.900 --> 02:48:50.500
well because the blood was cool well no it when we did our tournaments at my

02:48:50.500 --> 02:48:53.940
college it was on Killer Instinct we didn't have any Street Fighter machines

02:48:53.940 --> 02:48:57.540
we had a we had a vampire save that would also be the period of time though

02:48:57.540 --> 02:48:59.980
when all the Street Fighter games that were coming out were essentially just

02:48:59.980 --> 02:49:03.900
Street Fighter 2 champions we've had her to churbo Street Fighter 2 super and

02:49:03.900 --> 02:49:08.900
then there was Street Fighter 3 which kind of I mean it was it didn't have

02:49:08.900 --> 02:49:12.700
that same fire under it when it came out but like even my arcade that I worked

02:49:12.700 --> 02:49:15.860
out later than that it was Tekken 3 but then again we were also in Amco arcade

02:49:15.860 --> 02:49:22.460
hmm I'm just saying well I haven't been to a Street Fighter tournament yeah it's

02:49:22.460 --> 02:49:29.060
funny to hear that because um like I like the way the way the way it's

02:49:29.060 --> 02:49:31.820
presented to me and the way I remember from my own youth is that everybody

02:49:31.820 --> 02:49:36.540
gravitated to Street Fighter you know and and it needs to continue that might

02:49:36.540 --> 02:49:41.180
be more of a West Coast thing and it is well it is also I I think if you look at

02:49:41.180 --> 02:49:43.780
the internet and a lot of stuff like a lot of the fighting game stuff on the

02:49:43.780 --> 02:49:47.220
internet I I don't doubt what right steel is saying at all it does seem to

02:49:47.220 --> 02:49:51.460
be heavily dominated with Street Fighter especially the eSports stuff all this

02:49:51.460 --> 02:49:54.500
stuff we're talking about that didn't exist in the area you're talking about

02:49:54.500 --> 02:49:59.660
eSports wasn't a thing back then you know so now that it's even even even

02:49:59.660 --> 02:50:03.940
before eSports like when Mortal Kombat came out I remember a lot of people

02:50:03.940 --> 02:50:09.060
didn't take it seriously and and the post arcade Mortal Kombat they never got

02:50:09.060 --> 02:50:13.100
any tournament play well even though they were popular game Mortal Kombat 3

02:50:13.100 --> 02:50:16.620
is like Mortal Kombat 3 especially was kind of a joke in the fighting game

02:50:16.620 --> 02:50:19.900
community because of all the not just the over-the-top stuff but the combos

02:50:19.900 --> 02:50:24.060
and the the the juggles that go on forever and just kind of the style is so

02:50:24.060 --> 02:50:27.380
much different I remember that game was really not well received by the fighting

02:50:27.380 --> 02:50:32.580
game community you know casual people liked it enough but it's funny you say

02:50:32.580 --> 02:50:37.640
that because because a lot of people you mean that they're huge into the into

02:50:37.640 --> 02:50:42.620
Marvel you know and that's all you know that's all bullshit juggles and 99 hit

02:50:42.620 --> 02:50:46.660
combos that's true all right Ross still I gotta let you know I gotta let you go

02:50:46.660 --> 02:50:49.860
for time but thank you so much for calling in I really appreciate it okay

02:50:49.860 --> 02:50:54.140
all right take care buddy all right that's gonna do it for the

02:50:54.140 --> 02:50:58.320
Skype line tonight I'm sorry to those you that didn't get through but it was a

02:50:58.320 --> 02:51:02.060
popular first night here on vlog send us an email so put your thoughts there

02:51:10.700 --> 02:51:16.220
next week right that's my response let's go to our Twitter because we got to get

02:51:16.220 --> 02:51:20.580
some of these out real quick here twitter.com slash olr 13x forever tweets

02:51:20.580 --> 02:51:27.500
us saying Loki olr looks much cuter in this picture than I remember them I'm

02:51:27.500 --> 02:51:31.780
not sure how Loki should take that I'm assuming that's the one I'm sure I'm

02:51:31.780 --> 02:51:39.020
assuming it's the geek life one because that's the article we've been we haven't

02:51:39.020 --> 02:51:42.820
we haven't taken new publicity photos in at least like six years cuz that was at

02:51:42.820 --> 02:51:48.140
my like old house so yeah took those pictures no Eddie that was from the

02:51:48.140 --> 02:51:52.180
Eddie set Tia did the very very first one a long time ago that was on that

02:51:52.180 --> 02:51:56.300
mark for a while and Eddie did a set that's right now come here was awful in

02:51:56.300 --> 02:52:01.460
that yeah no I loved it but anyway it was awful I thought you look cute but

02:52:01.460 --> 02:52:04.980
we need new ones we need to find a photographer friend maybe I know a

02:52:04.980 --> 02:52:10.180
couple get some new ones taken and you can see how you can see how cute Loki

02:52:10.180 --> 02:52:16.780
is now it depends on what day you see me like right now I need a haircut and a

02:52:16.780 --> 02:52:24.020
shave all right going to a couple tweets from Tiger claw on Twitter says trials

02:52:24.020 --> 02:52:30.300
evolution popularity is due to true skill according to red links trials

02:52:30.300 --> 02:52:34.660
evolution of course is on the Xbox Live arcade and it set a one-day sales

02:52:34.660 --> 02:52:39.340
record apparently because of how well trials HD had done this is the game

02:52:39.340 --> 02:52:44.020
that's like kinda excite by the bike II at least that's what it is at first look

02:52:44.020 --> 02:52:50.780
let's see what is why why are people loving this so much according to Taro

02:52:50.780 --> 02:52:55.140
virtually who's the managing director at red links I think there is a more

02:52:55.140 --> 02:52:59.140
positive explanation than sheer masochism it's like in real life when you

02:52:59.140 --> 02:53:02.540
start practicing something very physics based like tennis or billiards there's

02:53:02.540 --> 02:53:06.740
no limit how far you can develop your skills in trials is also about your own

02:53:06.740 --> 02:53:11.300
true skill not the skill of your avatar or game character the sense of

02:53:11.300 --> 02:53:15.060
accomplishment is that much more genuine because it was all your own doing your

02:53:15.060 --> 02:53:18.660
skill your persistence and also I believe they are referring to not a

02:53:18.660 --> 02:53:22.180
picture of me but a picture of my cat and yes my cat is much cuter than I am

02:53:22.180 --> 02:53:28.300
that what it is all because you just tweeted a picture your cat I put the cat

02:53:28.300 --> 02:53:33.740
in there for size reference okay see under so it is a large someone asked

02:53:33.740 --> 02:53:37.780
like ready to be sure me I'm like no sure me hasn't moved Loki's house all

02:53:37.780 --> 02:53:45.340
right moving on tiger claw says there's a portal cartoon being made what yeah I

02:53:45.340 --> 02:53:49.420
didn't hear about this there is this a real thing or is this a fan thing I mean

02:53:49.420 --> 02:53:52.100
actually what's a fan thing I shouldn't say it like that it's not like a fan

02:53:52.100 --> 02:53:57.220
thing can't be rushed say is this a officially endorsed thing no but it's

02:53:57.220 --> 02:54:03.220
it's being done by professional animator it's Alex Zemke he worked on or the

02:54:03.220 --> 02:54:07.740
movies called companionship and he is a professional animator who and credits

02:54:07.740 --> 02:54:11.900
