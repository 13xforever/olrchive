WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
These are hosts, Dark Sakura, Sky and Lowkey

00:14.000 --> 00:16.000
Tonight April 8th, 2012

00:16.000 --> 00:19.000
Capcom responds to Better Business Bureau complaints

00:19.000 --> 00:22.000
Sex offenders get booted from Xbox Live in one state

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
And our listeners sound off

00:24.000 --> 00:26.000
Is EA really the worst company ever?

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
And welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Where every gamer has a voice

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
We are live for this April 8th of 2012

00:42.000 --> 00:45.000
With episode number 453 of our show

00:45.000 --> 00:47.000
My name is Rob Roberts

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
And I'll be joining you over the next few hours

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
Not with Dark Sakura

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Or Jamie Summers, sadly

00:53.000 --> 00:54.000
She is not here tonight

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
We had to make a last minute cancellation tonight

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
Because she's not feeling well

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
So we hope she feels better

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
She's got like a science fiction double feature

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
She has a sinus infection double feature

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Her sinus infection could be science fictional

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
It could be

01:08.000 --> 01:09.000
She sounded like hell

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
Let's just put it that way

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
She sounded like goddamn hell

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
And you did not want her on the show tonight

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
Also, Tech Master Lowkey

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
Is not here tonight

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
He's doing Easter stuff

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
With his Jewish wife

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
I don't know how that works

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
No, I

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
It's obviously a holiday for the family

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
So they're doing stuff with their kid

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
And all that

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
So there's no Dark Sakura

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
There's no Lowkey

01:33.000 --> 01:34.000
But there's me

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
Rob Roberts

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
And obviously you can hear over there

01:37.000 --> 01:38.000
My loud ass

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Interrupting

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Excuse me, Alan

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
You dropped

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
I keep forgetting you dropped your handle

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
A couple weeks ago

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
It's too mouthy and wordy to say

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Alright, well how you doing Alan?

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
I'm good

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
Alright

01:48.000 --> 01:49.000
I haven't been on the show in a long time

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
You haven't

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
So I'm glad we have an opportunity

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
To have you on

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Again tonight

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
Yes

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
For the listeners who haven't heard you

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
Why don't you give us a quick introduction

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
About yourself

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
And the types of games you like

01:59.000 --> 02:00.000
And all that

02:00.000 --> 02:01.000
Mid 30's

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
Been playing since the Atari 2600

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
Favorite console is the Super NES

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
Right now I'm playing a lot of PC games

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Dragon Age, Orange

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
Dragon Age

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Oranges

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
Not Oranges

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Which would be weird

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Mass Effect

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
And so on

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Alright

02:21.000 --> 02:22.000
And we live together

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
So

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
That's right

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
So you get to see me all the time

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Yes

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Alright

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
Um

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
We have to have a third co-host obviously

02:32.000 --> 02:34.000
The Orange Country doesn't work without three co-hosts

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
Insert Ferret here

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Alright

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Say hello everybody

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Welcome back

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
By the way to VX JasonXV

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
Or just Jason if you will

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Is back with us tonight

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Three weeks

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Uh

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Three weeks

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Quite a better turnaround

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
Than the eight years that we were going on

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
About previously

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
I was gonna say

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
For somebody who lives in Denver

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
That's really good to be able to get to a show

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Three weeks

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
It's like I got home on the train

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
Turned around

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
Took another one

02:59.000 --> 03:00.000
And hey I'm back

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Which is actually what happened

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Pretty much

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
But now I don't know how much I can and can't say on the show

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
But I think I'm okay saying

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
You were trying to get like a job thing

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Out here

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
And you got it

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
Yay

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Congrats

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
So that's why you're back

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
Last time I was out here for my interview

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
And I'm still

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
I'm still kind of giving the company the chance to

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
Announce it because they make a pretty big deal out of it

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
But yeah I got the job offer

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
Monday night

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
I took Tuesday to pack and wrap up things at home

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
And tell my other job

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Peace out guys

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
I'm on a train tomorrow

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
Love to give you two weeks

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
Two weeks notice

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
But that's not happening

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
So Monday

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Monday night

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Solidified everything

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
Tuesday night

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Tuesday in general

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
Finished off everything that I needed to do

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Wednesday morning on the train

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
And I've been here since

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
Just after business hours on Thursday

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
But there were no snakes on the train

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
So we're good

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
There were no snakes on the train

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
Alright that's good

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
That's good

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Well welcome back

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
I'm glad you're able to be here

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Especially on a week where we need a lot of people

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
But you have the

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
You have an awesome radio voice

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
So I'm happy you get to kind of step up and be a co-host tonight

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
So some folks might be wondering like

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Well why

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
Okay Rob why would you do a show without Dark Sakura

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
And without Loki

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
And you know well

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
With no slight to Alan or Jason

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
Who are fine step in hosts tonight

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
But you know it is a little weird

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
That there's only one of the regular OLR hosts here

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
But remember guys

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
It is the show where every gamer has a voice

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
And it's not necessarily just about me

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Or just about Jamie

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Or just about Loki

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
It's about you guys

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
So we want to make sure that we would have a show here

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
And a place where you guys can interact

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
And still chat with us

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
I have to say I did take some inspiration

04:33.000 --> 04:36.000
A little bit from what's going on over at Video Game Outsiders

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
Which is another show on the All Games Network that I listen to

04:39.000 --> 04:42.000
And poor John's been holding down the fort over there for a while

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
Because his two co-hosts have had just other stuff going on

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
But they still do the show every week

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
So there's no reason we can't

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
We're actually not going to be here next week

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
That was a pre-planned thing

04:53.000 --> 04:56.000
So we knew that Loki would be out tonight

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
But we thought Dark Sakura would be here

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
But of course people get sick

04:59.000 --> 05:00.000
That happens

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
But we knew we would not be here next week

05:01.000 --> 05:04.000
And we didn't want to go two weeks in a row with no show

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
So we have the show going tonight

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
And you guys can chat live with us

05:08.000 --> 05:11.000
chat.orangeloungeradio.com

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
And AlphaKanandagram starts us off in the chatroom tonight saying

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
Yay weird show! Fuck yes!

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
Aww, but you guys

05:19.000 --> 05:23.000
More like Brorange Lounge Radio, right?

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
I don't want you guys to feel like it's the weird show

05:25.000 --> 05:29.000
I mean obviously Jason, you've been our webmaster for years and years

05:29.000 --> 05:33.000
And you played Bamani games just like Dark Sakura, Loki and I did

05:33.000 --> 05:34.000
Just at a different arcade

05:34.000 --> 05:39.000
So I know you followed that scene probably longer than we did

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
But you were in all that stuff

05:41.000 --> 05:45.000
And Alan, well Alan's cool too

05:45.000 --> 05:48.000
Right

05:48.000 --> 05:52.000
Alright, before we get into How Was Your Gaming Week and all that tonight

05:52.000 --> 05:56.000
I thought we could talk a little bit about not just the weird oddities

05:56.000 --> 05:59.000
Of having only one of the regular hosts here

05:59.000 --> 06:03.000
But I mentioned next week we were going to not be here

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
Because I have a pre-planned trip

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
We're going to Disneyland, which I know shock and awe, dying of shock

06:09.000 --> 06:12.000
Alan's coming with me of course because he does that

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
And we're going to the final ever electronica

06:21.000 --> 06:25.000
But for those who didn't know, they turned California Adventure into

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
Like this whole, they turned a part of it, not the whole damn park

06:28.000 --> 06:32.000
But they turned a little part of it into The Grid on like Friday and Saturday nights

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
And they did this back when the Tron Legacy movie first came out in theaters

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
And it got extended several times

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
I think it was only supposed to run for about 6 months the first time

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
It's been extended to like 18 months or even longer now

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
It's been about a year and a half since that movie came out

06:47.000 --> 06:51.000
But one of the other cool things, and I know we've talked about it on the show before

06:51.000 --> 06:56.000
Is that electronica also has a replica of Flynn's arcade from the movie

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
With classic 80's video games that are in great condition

07:00.000 --> 07:04.000
Because you know it's Disneyland, they're not going to let shitty run down games into their park

07:04.000 --> 07:07.000
And the one time I have seen a broken machine there

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
They had a dude out there fixing it in like 5 seconds

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
So we're going to go say goodbye to electronica

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Because you know they made a business decision to get rid of it

07:15.000 --> 07:18.000
Because Tron the movie again is a year and a half old now

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
We don't know if they're going to be doing a sequel

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
Although there is the anime that's supposed to be out in summer or fall

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
So it seems weird to me that they're not going to have awareness for that

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
But they're replacing it with the mad tea party

07:31.000 --> 07:34.000
And that's tea as in just the letter T

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
Not as in a sippy drink that British people have at lunchtime

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
Where's failed trombone? Do you have it queued up?

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
I can get failed trombone queued up

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
It's too late

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
Why are you

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
And you're upset about the mad tea party

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Like you're personally offended right

07:53.000 --> 07:57.000
We saw that movie and I didn't think it was going to be very good

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
And you were very optimistic

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
It'll be okay it's Tim Burton and it was shitty

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
I didn't like it at all

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
I know some people were into it but no I didn't like it at all

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
But here's the thing and the reason why I bring it up

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
Is that unfortunately with electronica changing over to the mad tea party

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
They're going to close Flynn's arcade

08:15.000 --> 08:19.000
Now supposedly the mad hatter is supposed to have some type of arcade

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
But I don't believe that means he's keeping the 80's retro games

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
From what I hear they're supposed to be like skee-ball

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
And it's what happened to every other arcade from the 80's

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
They're now birthday kid palace

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
Where the machines spit tickets and all that stuff

08:36.000 --> 08:39.000
Although I heard the mad tea party won't even give you tickets

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
It's just playing skee-ball for the sake of playing skee-ball

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
Which is weird and absurd to me but whatever

08:44.000 --> 08:48.000
Disney Imagineers if you want to listen to me for a very awesome idea

08:48.000 --> 08:52.000
You should fix the bootsy run down arcade off of space mountain

08:52.000 --> 08:54.000
And put Flynn's arcade there

08:54.000 --> 08:55.000
And it will be super awesome

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
Exactly and tomorrow lands a great fit for it

08:58.000 --> 09:00.000
Or just fucking bulldoze interventions

09:00.000 --> 09:03.000
Cause who goes in the interventions building like ever

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
And just make a giant Tron grid

09:05.000 --> 09:09.000
It would only cost like $11 billion and it would be amazing

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
But my hope is, here's my secret hope

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
I have a secret wish hope pie in the sky idea

09:16.000 --> 09:20.000
And that is that maybe if we go to the last electronica

09:20.000 --> 09:23.000
They're going to give away some of the arcade games

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
You get an arcade machine

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
You get an arcade machine

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
Everybody gets an arcade machine

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
In reality that fucking won't happen

09:31.000 --> 09:34.000
Because I think they're leasing them from a local company

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
That specializes in this shit

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
But hold on I want my idea

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
I want my pie in the sky idea

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
And that is that they're going to give away these machines

09:42.000 --> 09:48.000
So I was thinking about if you could have a retro arcade machine in your house

09:48.000 --> 09:51.000
What arcade machine would you want to have in your house

09:51.000 --> 09:55.000
If you could have something from Flynn's Arcade in your house

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
What game would you want

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
This is a tough one

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
Cause there's a lot of like great games

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
And part of me wants to say Dig Dug

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
Cause I'm actually pretty good at that one

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
Part of me wants to say BurgerTime

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Because I damn near bought a-

10:10.000 --> 10:13.000
I came so fucking close to buying a BurgerTime machine

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Like not even a couple months ago

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
And then I realized I live in an apartment

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
And that would be a really shitty idea

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
To bring an arcade machine into the apartment

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
But you saw when I saw that BurgerTime machine Alan right

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
I was like I could forego getting an iPad

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Your BurgerTime machine

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
And you're just rolling your eyes in the back of your head

10:30.000 --> 10:34.000
But I think the machine I would really really want to have

10:34.000 --> 10:36.000
I don't know why it's just

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
Is a spy hunter machine

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
Any of the racing games from that era

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
Cause they all had different like variety of pedals

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
Switches, different steering wheels

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
Like All Points Bulletin was actually one of my favorites

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
From that time period

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Or at least that's how my brain seems to relate it

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
I think I just have a lot of memories of Spy Hunter as a kid

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
Because that's what they had

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
Okay shut up

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
It was at the local roller rink

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
That's where all the arcade games from my youth came from too

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
It was that or the pizza parlor

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Pizza parlor was like a sit down

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
Either like a joust or a galaga or something like that

11:09.000 --> 11:12.000
One of the two sided top sitting

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
It's probably a name for that I don't know what it is

11:14.000 --> 11:18.000
So I want a Spy Hunter machine

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
I want Oprah to give me a Spy Hunter machine at the last electronica

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
Jason what arcade machine would you want?

11:24.000 --> 11:28.000
You know I had one in mind

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
And then my brain replaced it with Neo Geo

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
So I kind of forgot what it was entirely

11:32.000 --> 11:36.000
Not just Light Cycle Tron

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
But one of the I think it was like the

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
Movie Tron arcade machines

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
There were two Tron machines

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
There was Tron

11:43.000 --> 11:44.000
It was just called Tron

11:44.000 --> 11:47.000
And then there was Discs of Tron

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
And did that have

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
I think there's even a third one

11:50.000 --> 11:54.000
Because there should have been one that had like the assault on the MCP and tanks

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
Tron was made up of four mini games

11:56.000 --> 11:58.000
And I think you're just thinking they're all separate games

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
Wasn't Tron originally just a Light Cycles game?

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
That's one of the mini games

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
It's just the most popular one

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
There was Light Cycle game

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
There's the MCP cone

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
There's the tanks

12:08.000 --> 12:09.000
And there's

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
I would probably say Discs of Tron

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
Discs of Tron

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
I would not mind more time with that game

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
I've only played it like once or twice

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
And it looked really good

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
It was very engaging

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
It was really fun

12:19.000 --> 12:23.000
Alan, if you could steal one machine out of Flynn's arcade

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
Or excuse me, have Oprah give you one

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
Gift you one

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
What would you want her to give you?

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
Well I don't think it's in Flynn's arcade

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
But if I had to have a vintage cabinet in my house

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
It would have to be multiplayer

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
And it would have to have large cabinets

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
To set drinks on

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
And I would go with Golden Axe

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
Because that game is amazing

12:41.000 --> 12:44.000
I think Golden Axe is better left in my memory

12:44.000 --> 12:47.000
Like every time I've played Golden Axe

12:47.000 --> 12:50.000
Not to just take a crap on what Alan said

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
Not this shitty port that was on Genesis

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
And is currently on XBLA or whatever

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
But the original arcade Golden Axe

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
With three people

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
It was a good time

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
It was good memories

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
It was good memories

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
God damn that goblin

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
Attack faster, come on

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
Awesome comments from our chat room

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
Chat.orangelaungeradio.com

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
Because everybody's joining in in the chat room

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
Love this

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
DDRdollabill says

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
Robotron2084 would be his game

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
Hands bloody fucking down

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Brad from Pod Culture

13:21.000 --> 13:22.000
Love this answer

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
This is one I would want too

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Fucking Star Wars the arcade game

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
Good call

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
I completely forgot about that

13:28.000 --> 13:31.000
I'm not even like a Star Wars aficionado

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
And all that

13:32.000 --> 13:34.000
I mean I like the movies

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
I don't like obsess over them

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
I'm more of a Trekkie than a Warsie

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
But the arcade game

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Was so fucking good

13:41.000 --> 13:42.000
Is that the Vectrex one?

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
Yes

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
Did you know there was an Empire Strikes Back of that?

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
There was

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
I don't remember how official it was

13:49.000 --> 13:53.000
But a buddy of mine that has a bunch of arcade machines down in his basement

13:53.000 --> 13:54.000
Has it on a little

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
Not a ROM switcher but a cart switcher

13:57.000 --> 14:01.000
And I was completely unaware that there was essentially a second Star Wars arcade

14:01.000 --> 14:02.000
There was

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
There was

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
It was a little more complicated

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
But yes there was one

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
It was pretty awesome

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
Let's see

14:08.000 --> 14:09.000
Tigerclaw on chat says

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
If they did that

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Meaning handing out the arcade games

14:12.000 --> 14:15.000
Rob would scream like a schoolgirl if he won an actual arcade

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
But then he'd be like

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
Wait a minute how am I supposed to get this thing out of here

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
I would tie it to the roof of my Honda

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
I don't even care

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Go driving down by five

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Catching all the bugs

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Jim Sally says

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Burger Time all the way

14:28.000 --> 14:29.000
Burger Time for the win

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Yeah I was almost there too

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Stan says

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
Pac-Man but the small table version

14:35.000 --> 14:38.000
Where both players sit at opposite ends of each other

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
A cocktail machine

14:40.000 --> 14:41.000
Cocktail machine

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
Oh my god I'd love to have a cocktail machine

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
Those are hard to come by though

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
Cocktail machines are really sought after

14:48.000 --> 14:51.000
Isn't that new Pac-Man game that came out that was incredibly expensive

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
That's the latest cocktail cabinet

14:53.000 --> 14:56.000
It was definitely inspired by cocktail machines

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
Yeah I know it's not Pac-Man Championship Edition

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
But like an arcade

15:00.000 --> 15:01.000
Pac-Man Battle Royale

15:01.000 --> 15:02.000
I remember it had a funny name

15:02.000 --> 15:06.000
And it's in Vegas and like New York and no where else or something

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
My Dave and Busters in Colorado had it

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
It was really fun

15:10.000 --> 15:11.000
Rama says

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Magic Sword

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Oh good fucking call I love that one

15:15.000 --> 15:18.000
That was the one they had at Round Table Pizza

15:18.000 --> 15:19.000
That I would just play the shit out of

15:19.000 --> 15:20.000
Pork Chop says

15:20.000 --> 15:22.000
APB is awesome

15:22.000 --> 15:25.000
Brad from Pod Culture also says

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
The original Gauntlet would be hella awesome

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
There's a good multiplayer game too

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
So good calls all around

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
Love the classic arcade game suggestions

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
We're going to be very sad when Electronica closes

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
But our plan

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
There's actually like a group of us going

15:40.000 --> 15:44.000
Like I'm meeting up there with some of my friends from Warcraft

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
Nerd nerd

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
Some of my DDR friends from back in the day

15:48.000 --> 15:49.000
Mel and Mel

15:49.000 --> 15:53.000
Mr. Mel B who was a big DDR freestyler back in the day

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
Is going with us

15:54.000 --> 15:55.000
It's going to be good

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
And our plan is to at the end of all of it

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
Yell end of line and then collapse into tears

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
Drunken tears

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
And I want to see Laser Man because I still haven't seen that shit

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Laser Man will be there from what I understand

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
So there you go

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
Hey Dark Soccer joined our chat room

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
Hello Dark Soccer and said Dave and Busters in Roseville has it

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
So if you want to go play Pac-Man Battle Royale there you go

16:17.000 --> 16:18.000
We haven't been there since

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
We haven't been there in a while

16:19.000 --> 16:23.000
Yeah I think it's one of those things that's going to become a staple of Dave and Busters

16:23.000 --> 16:26.000
Because it's not redemption but it kind of feels like it

16:26.000 --> 16:30.000
And it's just a quick engaging game of Pac-Man

16:30.000 --> 16:34.000
I'm thinking Dark Soccer should have a local birthday thingy thingy at Dave and Busters

16:34.000 --> 16:38.000
Wink wink nudge nudge with her two gay besties

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
If nothing else

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
Should have a Dave and Busters night

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
That would be fun wouldn't it Alan?

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
Yes

16:47.000 --> 16:48.000
Alright

16:48.000 --> 16:52.000
Anyhow that's enough for our reminiscing and retro arcade games

16:52.000 --> 16:55.000
And we will not be here again next week

16:55.000 --> 16:58.000
Our pal Bobby Black Wolf who we are usually after

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
At All Games Radio where we do tape live every Sunday night right after his show

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
At 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

17:04.000 --> 17:05.000
He's been off for the past two weeks

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
He will be back next week

17:07.000 --> 17:10.000
So at least live folks you have something to look forward to

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Our 9 cast of course also live on Sunday nights

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
They will still be doing their thing

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
They've been constant over the past few weeks

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
So there will at least be those shows to look forward to but no OLR

17:19.000 --> 17:23.000
We'll try to find a best up from the archives for you live folks

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Maybe a rarity

17:25.000 --> 17:29.000
I just came across a stockpile of episodes that aren't even up on the OLR archive

17:29.000 --> 17:32.000
So maybe I'll dig one of those up and play that next week

17:32.000 --> 17:33.000
It'll be fun

17:33.000 --> 17:36.000
Meanwhile let's talk about our gaming weeks

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
And how was your gaming week?

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
I would usually say ladies first but there are no ladies

17:40.000 --> 17:44.000
So Alan since you're within kicking range

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Kick kick go

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
How was your gaming week?

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
I've been playing the Mass Effect trilogy

17:48.000 --> 17:51.000
Inspired mostly in part by all of the wank

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
I got mad and bullshit over the ending of Mass Effect 3

17:54.000 --> 17:58.000
I've had the first two games in my steam account thanks to those crazy sales

17:58.000 --> 18:03.000
So I was like I'm gonna play these things and hopefully get to 3 at some point if I can buy it

18:03.000 --> 18:09.000
So two or three weeks ago I beat Mass Effect 1 on both Paragon and Renegade

18:09.000 --> 18:13.000
Which is sort of goody two shoes good guy and asshole good guy

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
And now I'm playing Mass Effect 2 and I'm ready to beat it

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
Like I just started the end game mission that's all very intense

18:19.000 --> 18:23.000
The characters die and I had to save and quit to do the show

18:23.000 --> 18:27.000
So we are literally taking you away from doing Mass Effect right now

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
Yes but that's all I've been playing for the last week

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
It's probably good to have a break once in a while

18:31.000 --> 18:34.000
Microphone extension cords and headphones

18:34.000 --> 18:36.000
No we need him to focus

18:36.000 --> 18:40.000
He needs to be funny because we don't have Loki or Darth Sock tonight

18:40.000 --> 18:43.000
So unless you want to be funny he has to bring the funny

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
Alright so that's it for you Mass Effect, Mass Effect and more Mass Effect

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
Now what are you going to do? Are you going to buy the third game or are you going to try to play the second one over again?

18:50.000 --> 18:54.000
Well I'm doing my goody two shoes play through right now

18:54.000 --> 18:58.000
So once I beat that then I'll load up my female femshep

18:58.000 --> 19:02.000
And she's just like fuck you, fuck you, kill everybody and save the universe

19:02.000 --> 19:05.000
And I don't give a shit because that's how she rolls

19:05.000 --> 19:08.000
That's another 40 or 50 hours of gameplay

19:08.000 --> 19:15.000
DarkSakura sent me her gaming week through proxy and she wants you all to know that she played a shitload of Portal 2 this past week

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
What a shock, yet has she touched that copy of Mass Effect I loaned her?

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
No

19:20.000 --> 19:23.000
That's alright, Portal 2 is a pretty kickass game

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
Alright, Jason how was your gaming week?

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Well as I kind of started to say at the top of the show

19:27.000 --> 19:32.000
The first half of the week almost didn't exist for me with trying to get back out here

19:32.000 --> 19:38.000
But I did load down my iPad for the train with games and I just kind of picked up some old favorites of mine

19:38.000 --> 19:42.000
Death Rally has a modern iOS remake which is really fun

19:42.000 --> 19:46.000
I picked that up again and started working through the missions again

19:46.000 --> 19:51.000
Jetpack Joyride and then a couple of silly little things like Sudoku type games

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
Pickris type games

19:54.000 --> 20:01.000
And I feel like I'm missing something significant but considering that consoles weren't really in the mix I don't think I was

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Sometimes you have to game on the go

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Yeah

20:04.000 --> 20:13.000
And when you have 33 hours to do nothing but sit there and bounce to the left and to the right and back and forth and stumble through a narrow corridor

20:13.000 --> 20:16.000
By which I just mean a train in real life

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
Yes, certainly

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Go to our chatroom at chat.orangelandtrader.com

20:20.000 --> 20:24.000
There's a lot of people talking about Mass Effect and lots of people getting into Mass Effect

20:24.000 --> 20:28.000
AcidicVampire says everyone should play the Mass Effect series, end of story

20:28.000 --> 20:33.000
A lot of folks saying they got the Steam deals going on there

20:33.000 --> 20:41.000
Let's see, Dark Soccer is yelling at me saying girl I'm on my PC unless somebody wants to buy me Mass Effect 1 on Steam

20:41.000 --> 20:49.000
Tigerclaw said I bought Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2 for $3.60 but you may want to wait until BioWare releases the patch that will fix the face import bug

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
Which is set to be released next week

20:51.000 --> 20:57.000
Which is great because I won't get to Mass Effect 3 before next week so I will never have known that that was ever a problem

20:57.000 --> 21:04.000
I just had someone on my Facebook a couple hours ago post that they finally beat Mass Effect 3

21:04.000 --> 21:09.000
And of course they've already had the perspective of all the wank about the ending for the last two weeks

21:09.000 --> 21:13.000
To I guess if they wanted to be pretentious and rise above that

21:13.000 --> 21:23.000
And they said I have a lot of questions and it's not confusing at all and it's not really wrapped up into a neat little bow but they were satisfied with it

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
So they were like I don't get it, I don't get the rage

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
I heard it's one of those endings that makes you madder the more you think about it

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
So like maybe he's not mad today but next week he'll be like raging internet angry

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Or 3am

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
WAIT WHAT

21:38.000 --> 21:41.000
Waking up in a cold sweat DAMN YOU

21:41.000 --> 21:52.000
I'm prepared to be let down by the ending of Mass Effect 3 but just the adventure from Mass Effect 1 and even I'm about halfway through Mass Effect 2 right now

21:52.000 --> 22:03.000
Well I don't want to say 2 is so much better because 1 was awesome but if the last 20 minutes of the endgame rashetty for the whole trilogy

22:03.000 --> 22:12.000
That franchise in my opinion has given me at least 100 hours of quality emotional rewarding gameplay

22:12.000 --> 22:15.000
So it's not a waste of time

22:15.000 --> 22:20.000
And of course there's going to be more DLC some of which obviously will come up a little later in the show when we get to news

22:20.000 --> 22:29.000
So let's see my gaming week so Mass Effect for me as well just like Alan I got sucked into Mass Effect amongst all the chatter of Mass Effect 3

22:29.000 --> 22:36.000
And Shane basically bullied me into playing Mass Effect like basically would threaten to kick me out of the WoW guild if I don't start playing Mass Effect or something like that

22:36.000 --> 22:41.000
So I've been playing it, it's been amazing as I've talked about in previous weeks on the show

22:41.000 --> 22:46.000
I'm just still cleaning up the loyalty missions and getting ready, I gotta catch up to where Alan's at

22:46.000 --> 22:51.000
I have been playing a few other games though I want to tell you guys about, one of them is old and one of them is very new

22:51.000 --> 22:58.000
The old one I want to talk about tonight is a game I got for $15 at Target it was on clearance

22:58.000 --> 23:00.000
I might be partially responsible for this

23:00.000 --> 23:05.000
Yes you were kind of an enabler you were like hey you should get this it's $15 and it has dance in it you'll like it

23:05.000 --> 23:11.000
And I pick up the box and I'm like I think I heard about this game and I heard it was really basic

23:11.000 --> 23:17.000
And I looked at the song list I'm like well if it's basic it still has a really great song list so I pick up a game called Dance Paradise

23:17.000 --> 23:21.000
Which was $15 which was one of the early Kinect games

23:21.000 --> 23:22.000
Is that THQ or Ubisoft?

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
I want to say it's THQ that did this one

23:25.000 --> 23:29.000
Here's the thing Dance Paradise it has a really good song list

23:29.000 --> 23:37.000
It's got like Lady Gaga it's kind of a euro infused song list it's like songs I think that were bigger a little bit bigger on the other side of the pond

23:37.000 --> 23:43.000
Because you got things like Jerry Halliwell and nobody cared about the Spice Girls in America once they split up

23:43.000 --> 23:50.000
But you know you got Lady Gaga you got a few Rihanna it's basically gay bar in a box right

23:50.000 --> 23:55.000
And you know it's going to be good music because it's gay bar in a box and it's a great song list don't get me wrong

23:55.000 --> 24:02.000
And it's also really cool because you get the little music videos actually play in the background while you're playing which not every game has

24:02.000 --> 24:12.000
That was pretty cool but it's just it was so fucking basic like I don't know how else to describe this game

24:12.000 --> 24:17.000
Like and the way you play it is really stupid like

24:17.000 --> 24:24.000
Because you have to take a you start in the center and then to do a certain dance move you have to take a step to the left to do it

24:24.000 --> 24:27.000
And then a step to the right and it's not the time warp

24:27.000 --> 24:32.000
Yes exactly you jump to the left and step to the right but it's like Lady Gaga you're dancing to

24:32.000 --> 24:37.000
Imagine it looks like rock band where you have like the four columns that notes fall down

24:37.000 --> 24:45.000
Well you have to literally walk into each column in order to do the move and instead of falling notes you have falling dance moves

24:45.000 --> 24:51.000
So maybe you're like doing a little disco or you're opening your arms back and forth or you know kind of a lot of the same stuff you see in Dance Central

24:51.000 --> 24:59.000
But the fact that you move back for like who designed that that's just like that's not even that it's so weird

24:59.000 --> 25:06.000
For those who play connect in a loft giant warehouse floor for all the room you need to play it

25:06.000 --> 25:11.000
But here's the other thing that kind of disappointed me is that there was a good game in there somewhere

25:11.000 --> 25:18.000
Because one of the things that was really cool about it was that some of the moves that you did mimicked the dance moves in the video

25:18.000 --> 25:24.000
And I thought well that's that's a good thing to see in a music game is like learn to do the dance from the video that was really cool

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
Because Dance Central doesn't really even do that right and that's the king of the crop

25:27.000 --> 25:32.000
You might see some like you'll definitely see like like for um oh

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
There's a little bit of booty and baby got back

25:34.000 --> 25:42.000
Yeah there's that and then what the hell's that oh what's the goblin male dance what's that

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
Soulja Boy tell us

25:43.000 --> 25:50.000
Soulja Boy okay thank you isn't it sad that that's how we communicate

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
We have problems

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
And unfortunately I know wow just enough to understand that too now

25:54.000 --> 26:00.000
Okay Soulja Boy you do that dance in Dance Central so some of the big ones are there

26:00.000 --> 26:04.000
But it doesn't like match the music video because Dance Central doesn't have the music videos

26:04.000 --> 26:07.000
And Dance Central is still a lot of fun I mean it doesn't really matter

26:07.000 --> 26:15.000
It kind of bothers me that like you have you have really good licenses and a really kick-ass song list in Dance Paradise

26:15.000 --> 26:20.000
And then what was the other big competitor to Dance Central that came out

26:20.000 --> 26:21.000
Dance Masters

26:21.000 --> 26:26.000
Dance Masters the Konami game Dance Masters is actually beautifully put together if you think about it

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
It's just para para of Kinect right

26:28.000 --> 26:35.000
Or even not not exactly there are three or four there are three or four

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
Wow

26:36.000 --> 26:43.000
There are three or four songs on the list that are Eurobeat and do have para para routines

26:43.000 --> 26:47.000
But everything else to the extent of my knowledge completely original

26:47.000 --> 26:54.000
But it really is like fully fledged dance minus walking around a stage because Kinect is narrow tracking

26:54.000 --> 26:59.000
A lot of them were like crossovers from DDR though they had a lot of DDR crossovers

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
Oh yeah everything was Konami original period

27:01.000 --> 27:08.000
But the ones that weren't para para were very the routines were actually well they were fun to watch

27:08.000 --> 27:11.000
Because I haven't exactly learned them yet but they were fun to watch

27:11.000 --> 27:19.000
But there was some really weird weird crossovers though because like I remember one of the songs was Exotic Ethnic

27:19.000 --> 27:24.000
Which I was trying to find in my my archive here but it's like it's not really a song you can dance to

27:24.000 --> 27:29.000
I mean it's a DDR song it's a great DDR song because the way DDR structured

27:29.000 --> 27:33.000
But now that we're kind of beyond the dance pad and in the whole like free movement

27:33.000 --> 27:37.000
Exotic Ethnic doesn't make a very good dancey song

27:37.000 --> 27:45.000
The routine from what I recall the little bits and pieces it like the song the song on DDR was like 200 beats per minute

27:45.000 --> 27:51.000
I found it here we go so you can kind of see what this looks like here and hear this song and like see the routine

27:51.000 --> 28:02.000
And realize it doesn't really work very well

28:02.000 --> 28:13.000
What is up with the backup dancers this is like pg-13 here look at this

28:13.000 --> 28:18.000
But anyway it's not a very like it's a good song like it was great back in the DDR days

28:18.000 --> 28:23.000
But like to like freestyle move it's weird and it doesn't really like make sense

28:23.000 --> 28:27.000
So here's the thing you've got a great interface and a great shell not even just dance masters

28:27.000 --> 28:31.000
But say rhythm party right the game that just came out on Xbox Live Arcade

28:31.000 --> 28:35.000
But not even the Bimani community seems to care about at this point

28:35.000 --> 28:39.000
It's actually a really well put together game and I've said that for weeks on the show

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
There's a Bimani community

28:40.000 --> 28:43.000
Yeah well you know what I mean I think there's a Bimani community

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
What's left of it? What's left of it?

28:45.000 --> 28:52.000
So you've got that and then you have to it's like they need to learn something from each other

28:52.000 --> 28:59.000
If you had rhythm party with Dance Paradise's song list you would have an amazing music game

28:59.000 --> 29:07.000
Or if you had you know something that if Konami would just take the risk and license more than literally three licensed songs

29:07.000 --> 29:14.000
Or if you know THQ would take the risk and spend a little more time designing a game that people actually want to play

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
And not just relying on the music to sell your game

29:17.000 --> 29:23.000
If they would both take that risk there could be a legit competitor to Dance Central which kind of has both

29:23.000 --> 29:31.000
But unfortunately both of them are looking to cash in a lot cheaper and don't want to take that financial risk which I can understand

29:31.000 --> 29:37.000
Konami a lot of these a lot of these companies that are producing these are when it comes to music and rhythm

29:37.000 --> 29:40.000
In my opinion they're mostly all on like the second tier

29:40.000 --> 29:48.000
And Konami as far as American and European releases minus DDR has pretty much become that

29:48.000 --> 29:51.000
Has gotten to that has driven themselves down to that point as well

29:51.000 --> 29:52.000
Oh yeah

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
Notably starting with Rock Revolution

29:53.000 --> 29:54.000
Harmonix is now the top tier

29:54.000 --> 29:57.000
Harmonix is absolutely the top tier and Konami is now under them

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
Absolutely I would sign on to that

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
It's too bad but there you go

30:01.000 --> 30:07.000
Anyhow so that was my big bloated Dance Paradise of a year and a half old game Dance Paradise there you go

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
And that was your gaming week

30:09.000 --> 30:15.000
One other game I'm sorry I have to say it quickly quickly there's a new pinball game that came out on Xbox Live Arcade

30:15.000 --> 30:18.000
And I don't even remember the name of it it's just called like pinball I think

30:18.000 --> 30:19.000
Arcade pinball or something

30:19.000 --> 30:25.000
Here's the thing though it's a bunch of classic tables it's it's the guys that made the like Williams pinball collection

30:25.000 --> 30:28.000
And the Stern pinball collection like those games have already been out

30:28.000 --> 30:32.000
They just basically ported it to Xbox Live Arcade but I see what they're doing they're piecemealing it

30:32.000 --> 30:36.000
Because the game itself comes with four tables

30:36.000 --> 30:40.000
It's four damn good tables it's Ripley's Believe It or Not which is a great table

30:40.000 --> 30:45.000
Arabian Nights and Theater of Magic and Black Hole are all great tables

30:45.000 --> 30:52.000
So it's like 800 Microsoft points for four like killer tables and then they're gonna do DLC later like Pinbot

30:52.000 --> 30:56.000
The thing that they have that Pinball FX doesn't have is licenses

30:56.000 --> 31:01.000
They're licensed with Stern and Williams so they're gonna get all those tables into their game

31:01.000 --> 31:06.000
But if you already own the collections that came out on Xbox previously

31:06.000 --> 31:10.000
I don't see the reason to get this whatsoever

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
But for those that missed it and want their game a little cheaper and more piecemeal

31:13.000 --> 31:16.000
If you like pinball there's some great tables in there

31:16.000 --> 31:21.000
And I don't remember Theater of Magic being in the collection so it's pretty cool that at least that game is there

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
Or if you're named Dark Soccer and just have all the tables in your house anyways

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
This may also not be for you as cheap as it as it is by comparison

31:28.000 --> 31:32.000
Well I want to say Ripley's Believe It or Not was one of their like sought after tables that they wanted

31:32.000 --> 31:35.000
So they can do a virtual version of it on the Xbox 360

31:35.000 --> 31:39.000
Pinball Arcade says Zethur in the chatroom at chat.orangesauceradio.com

31:39.000 --> 31:45.000
I knew it had a very very basic name to it so Pinball Arcade that's the name of it

31:45.000 --> 31:51.000
Medieval Madness is DLC says Zethur and I know I saw Pinbot in the list which is one of my favorites

31:51.000 --> 31:57.000
And you know they'll kind of do that so you know Pinball FX I like it a lot

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
It's got some great original tables

31:59.000 --> 32:02.000
I'm glad to see there's a little healthy competition now with both of them being out there

32:02.000 --> 32:05.000
And especially if you're a pinball fan it's a win-win situation

32:05.000 --> 32:11.000
So you know if you somehow missed the collection last time this is definitely worth checking out

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Alright now I'm done with my gaming week

32:13.000 --> 32:17.000
Housekeeping check us out on Twitter twitter.com slash o-l-r

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
Of course always our website orangesauceradio.com

32:19.000 --> 32:23.000
If you want to find more of the OL Army members check it out in the upper right hand corner

32:23.000 --> 32:27.000
At orangesauceradio.com there's a box called Extended Play where you can find us on Steam

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
You can find us at Last.fm

32:29.000 --> 32:33.000
Lots of places to play with other cool folks who are not going to be a jerk

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
Because you know the number one rule of the OL Army is don't be a dick

32:36.000 --> 32:42.000
Because there's so many dicks ruining the game experience on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network

32:42.000 --> 32:44.000
We want to be different than that

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
There you go

32:46.000 --> 32:49.000
Alright let's get into some actual gaming news

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Jason why don't you start us off tonight

32:51.000 --> 32:59.000
Harmonix has come full circle once again and is returning to its roots of a frequency amplitude inspired type of game

32:59.000 --> 33:07.000
Again taken from the Rock Band franchise that they've been so excellent with over the past 5 years? 6 years?

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
I actually don't even know what year they really started with it anymore

33:10.000 --> 33:17.000
They're returning to a frequency style layout with some very notable differences

33:17.000 --> 33:26.000
There was a very famous point in amplitude and frequencies history where you could learn the exact track that you have to make to get the absolute max score

33:26.000 --> 33:32.000
And Harmonix has responded to this by making Rock Band Blitz a slightly simpler game

33:32.000 --> 33:37.000
One track per instrument and it was either 2 or 3 targets per instrument

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
I forget which

33:39.000 --> 33:48.000
But the power ups aren't as track specific, the video is talking about a multi-measure automatic note auto player

33:48.000 --> 33:54.000
And then there was like a wrecking ball that kind of bounced around tracks in a diagonal manner picking up notes along the way

33:54.000 --> 34:02.000
And there's also no concept of a combo that you have to continually go on one measure to the next to extend the combo

34:02.000 --> 34:12.000
And you can actually just jump from instrument to instrument and apparently it'll go a long way towards making a slightly unique sound

34:12.000 --> 34:17.000
A slightly unique emphasis or you could just sit on your favorite instrument and play it the whole night

34:17.000 --> 34:28.000
It sounds like it's going to use your entire back catalog so if you've been playing since Rock Band and you've imported everything from game to game

34:28.000 --> 34:36.000
Plus all the DLC that you bought, all the Rock Band Network and what was the indie version of Rock Band Network?

34:36.000 --> 34:38.000
That is Rock Band Network, yeah

34:38.000 --> 34:42.000
Rock Band Store is the license, you know all that stuff

34:42.000 --> 34:46.000
It's sounding like you should be able to have all of your official and indie content

34:46.000 --> 34:55.000
No specific pricing and no specific import restrictions due out just yet but the game looks fun and it's always nice coming back to this style

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
I had a lot of fun with Rock Band Unplugged as well

34:57.000 --> 35:04.000
It's interesting like I was partially really excited by the news, I have to admit a hint of disappointment

35:04.000 --> 35:08.000
Because knowing that like this is the big project Harmonics has been working on

35:08.000 --> 35:13.000
I have to express a teeny bit of disappointment because I was like oh I was kind of hoping for something new

35:13.000 --> 35:18.000
But okay I mean it's really fucking hard to be disappointed when this sounds like a real powerhouse of a game

35:18.000 --> 35:23.000
And the fact that it imports everything that's already on your drive, that's huge

35:23.000 --> 35:26.000
What other company even keeps all your stuff like that anymore?

35:26.000 --> 35:30.000
Exactly, like seriously what other company is going to give you that type of value?

35:30.000 --> 35:34.000
Does EA own Harmonics at this point? No they don't, Harmonics is independent

35:34.000 --> 35:36.000
They bought themselves out from MTV

35:36.000 --> 35:39.000
I was like surely this is not behavior coming out of EA

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Well that just proves Harmonics is independent

35:41.000 --> 35:48.000
So yeah they're truly independent because they came off the MTV games, that was where they were at when Rock Band started

35:48.000 --> 35:58.000
But just the value they're giving you there, it's so amazing coming off the weeks of us talking about how developers want to lock you out of used games altogether

35:58.000 --> 36:03.000
Now it's like here's a game that enhances the value of all the DLC you've already bought

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
Like well fucking done, applause

36:06.000 --> 36:13.000
This is, I mean I feel like an asshole for saying that I even expressed a hint of disappointment at this game

36:13.000 --> 36:19.000
I'll definitely be picking it up day one, I mean now that I see kind of all the pieces and I'm like okay

36:19.000 --> 36:25.000
I did like amplitude and frequency a lot, people did say they wanted a new frequency and amplitude

36:25.000 --> 36:33.000
Even though this isn't really it, it's what they could get away with doing and know that it's going to be profitable

36:33.000 --> 36:36.000
And so I'm excited for it, I am

36:36.000 --> 36:46.000
I mean the way that I look at it is that we had the simple arcade style band

36:46.000 --> 36:52.000
I'm trying to avoid the word simulation because the point is we had the arcade style music experience

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
And that was literally with like Guitar Freaks Dramania, the early Konami games

36:55.000 --> 36:59.000
And then Guitar Hero came around, put it solely on the guitar

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
And then Rock Band came around and gave us the whole band

37:02.000 --> 37:07.000
And then Rock Band 3 came around which gave us the pro controllers and everything else

37:07.000 --> 37:16.000
Where you can use a no kidding digital drum kit and have an actual performing gear that you can actually plug in and use with the game

37:16.000 --> 37:20.000
What else are they going to add into the Rock Band franchise that isn't going to be tacky as hell

37:20.000 --> 37:26.000
And so instead to kind of go off the beaten path, whether they do something new which is hit or miss

37:26.000 --> 37:32.000
Or they use this engine that was really fun and have all of your content like you just said

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
That's not a bad decision

37:34.000 --> 37:38.000
I mean fucking how many songs have I bought on Rock Band

37:38.000 --> 37:42.000
It is disgusting how much DLC I have on my Xbox 360

37:42.000 --> 37:47.000
You're going to buy either a $30 or $40 game and you're going to import what $200 in content automatically

37:47.000 --> 37:51.000
Rock Band Blitz is on Xbox Live Arcade, it's at most going to be $20

37:51.000 --> 37:53.000
So maybe even $10

37:53.000 --> 37:54.000
Probably less than $20

37:54.000 --> 37:57.000
Well with 25 licensed songs or whatever it is they're doing

37:57.000 --> 38:00.000
That in turn are going to play in Rock Band 3

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
Amazing!

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
We love you Harmonix

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Who else is doing this?

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
You remember?

38:08.000 --> 38:12.000
Okay remember like three years ago before Rock Band 3 came out

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
And they were talking about the Rock Band store

38:14.000 --> 38:18.000
They were talking about how they wanted Rock Band to be like iTunes

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Like it's iTunes for your consoles

38:20.000 --> 38:24.000
And a lot of us kind of laughed it off and said oh yeah you're doing music

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
You're not the same as iTunes

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
iTunes is for your iPod

38:28.000 --> 38:31.000
And downloading a song into Rock Band is not the same as iTunes

38:31.000 --> 38:33.000
But now here we are years later

38:33.000 --> 38:35.000
That's what they were setting the seeds for

38:35.000 --> 38:37.000
Because now they've enhanced

38:37.000 --> 38:39.000
You didn't just buy Rock Band DLC

38:39.000 --> 38:45.000
You bought a song that functions in multiple ways on your console

38:45.000 --> 38:50.000
That is starting to feel a little more like iTunes for your console, that's amazing

38:50.000 --> 38:53.000
So like I said it's hard to be that upset

38:53.000 --> 38:55.000
And deep down inside I kind of think

38:55.000 --> 38:59.000
Rock Band Blitz is more of probably a side project

38:59.000 --> 39:01.000
To something that's you know

39:01.000 --> 39:03.000
Something that's really going on

39:03.000 --> 39:05.000
I bet there's something else

39:05.000 --> 39:07.000
I mean there was the iPhone stuff too

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
They had the vid rhythm or whatever that was called

39:09.000 --> 39:11.000
The sampler video plus audio

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
Yeah the experimental thing

39:13.000 --> 39:16.000
And maybe there'll be something else at E3 this year

39:16.000 --> 39:19.000
Because they've announced this in time for PAX obviously

39:19.000 --> 39:22.000
And you know we're showing it on the floor there

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
Maybe they've got something else to show at E3

39:24.000 --> 39:27.000
Maybe they're working on something for the next wave of consoles

39:27.000 --> 39:29.000
Maybe it's something for the Wii U, who knows

39:29.000 --> 39:35.000
So again my disappointment is like one grain of sand

39:35.000 --> 39:39.000
In a oh my god I can't wait to eat this delicious cake

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
It's gonna be amazing

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
And actually if anybody's interested

39:43.000 --> 39:47.000
I believe they're based out of Massachusetts

39:47.000 --> 39:52.000
When I was job hunting a couple people pushed me in their direction

39:52.000 --> 39:54.000
But I didn't really want to relocate

39:54.000 --> 39:57.000
But if you are willing to and you're interested

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
They actually had a lot of positions available

39:59.000 --> 40:02.000
Anything from creative to programming to design

40:02.000 --> 40:04.000
I think even like program management that kind of stuff

40:04.000 --> 40:06.000
If you're interested look them up

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
That's all I have to say

40:08.000 --> 40:12.000
As Rob stuffs his face full of popcorn

40:12.000 --> 40:14.000
Dead air

40:14.000 --> 40:16.000
I thought I had a break to eat

40:16.000 --> 40:18.000
Bad co-host

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
It's alright you're learning

40:20.000 --> 40:22.000
Learning

40:22.000 --> 40:24.000
You have to learn how to fill in those gaps

40:24.000 --> 40:26.000
So I can be a fat ass

40:26.000 --> 40:28.000
You'll get there

40:28.000 --> 40:30.000
Alright anyhow

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
Well let me ask Alan you've been awfully quiet on that story

40:32.000 --> 40:35.000
I mean I know you're not like as huge in the music games as the rest of us

40:35.000 --> 40:39.000
But surely that whole enhanced value thing is kind of making you go hmm

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Yeah I've kind of been abstaining because

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
Rock band and that whole genre

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Guitar Hero

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
I never really

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
Was into it at all

40:49.000 --> 40:53.000
But it sounds like what they're doing with this new Blitz game is amazing so

40:53.000 --> 40:57.000
You don't like watching your friends get drunk and sing Lady Gaga and make asses out of themselves?

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
Eh

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
You could get that before there was rock band

41:03.000 --> 41:07.000
I don't have a smart phone with a camera to put it on Facebook so

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
If I can't blackmail you then

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Then where's the fun in that

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Alright well another game was announced just this past week

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
It's a game

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
It's a reimagining of an old game

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
We've seen a few of these lately

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
WayForward the company that brought us

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
What the hell did they bring?

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
There was another

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
God dammit they did blood rain

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
I think blood rain betrayal was one of their games they did

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
There's another one I was trying to think of

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
They are now taking over the Double Dragon franchise

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
I had no idea that it was up for grabs

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
But it makes sense

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
Majesco was the ones that got the Double Dragon franchise

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
Who had it before?

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
I'm trying to remember

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
Trade West

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
Maybe Midway had it and it was one of the things that went under

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
When they went under

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
But Majesco got the Double Dragon franchise

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
So it's being reinvented as

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Double Dragon Neon

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Which is going to come out on Xbox Live

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
And Playstation Network

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
Why did they call it Double Dragon Neon?

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
Well because it is

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
80's-tastic

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
The colors

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
The colors are the best

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
around

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
Hopefully that can be in the game

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
But I don't know. There is a trailer

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
Let me play some of this for you

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
Because it does have some nice remix music

42:19.000 --> 42:23.000
And you can notice

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
The way the characters move

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Is very fluid and all that

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
You know it looks really nice

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
In HD

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
Yeah that is pretty

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Beyond pastel-tastic

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
Yeah and everybody is very 80-infused

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
Like you see the afros

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
And the leather jackets

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
And the boots with the fur on them and all that stuff

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
You know call me crazy

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
Or call me stupid if this already happened

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
But you know what I'd love to see a

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
Very modern remake of in this style

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
Captain America and the Avengers

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Well especially when there is the movie and everything

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
But I think they did another game for that

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Here is my concern with Double Dragon Neon

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
Okay I bought Double Dragon

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
When it was available on Xbox Live Arcade

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
It is not available anymore obviously

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
But it was available on Xbox Live Arcade for a short time

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
When you know other people had the license

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
We played it together and we did

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
We did

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
And then Darkstakers Dan yelled at us for trashing it

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
I remember that

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
Yes because we played through it and we were like

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
This game isn't very good

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
What the hell were we smoking when we were 12

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
This game sucks

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
And now I'm looking at this going

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
It looks like it's a faithful port

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
Of the original Double Dragon game

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
But Double Dragon

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
Maybe I'm just old but it kind of gets old

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
After the first stage

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
You're like punch punch

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
Kick kick kick and I'm over it

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
What Double Dragon

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Founded Final Fight made better

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
And I'd rather play that

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
But even playing Final Fight now

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Playing any of those old fighting games just doesn't feel the same

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
Better dudes

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
They're all the same

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
It would be cool if they could incorporate some of what we see

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
In new fighting games a little bit

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
Maybe more like versus

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
And special moves and combo attacks

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
Oh god

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
Don't give them ideas

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
But I will

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
I'll at least check out the demo

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
So that's coming out this summer

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
So what you're saying is

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
You want them to bring back that mode from

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
Tekken Tag Tournament

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Actually that mode kicked ass

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
So yes I want them to bring that back

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
It was a little bit more fun

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
Because there was the entire moveset

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
And a little bit more depth to a side scroller

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
And you could play it as panda

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
And the concept of a fighting game where a panda bear

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Beats up everyone

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Is pretty fucking awesome you have to admit

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
I think they brought that out it's just not a side scroller

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Oh right!

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Wow did

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
Panda kills everyone

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
Anyhow

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Wow reference number 5 today

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
Keep that number going

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
Yeah sorry

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Sorry guys

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
So for Pokemon fans and SRPG fans

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Nintendo of America

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
Is bringing Pokemon

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
And Nobunaga's

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Ambition

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
What?

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Nobunaga's Ambition

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
Nobunaga

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
Cowabunga

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Cowabunga?

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
They're bringing that to the US

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
Called Pokemon Conquest

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
And it's coming out on June 18th

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
And you play a warlord

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Who has a Pokemon

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
PAL and you have to build up your army

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
And it's skirmish based and it's an SRPG

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
And if you follow import games

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
And

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
You're a fan of

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Nobunaga's Ambition

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
This is great

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
You know I remember when I heard

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
That this game was coming out in Japan

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Like what a weird fucking idea

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
And to hear that this game

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
Is actually coming out here

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
I have mixed emotions

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Look I get it

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Pokemon has it's rabid fan base

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
That will buy almost anything that ties into Pokemon

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Like I'm totally

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
Like I understand that fine

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
But how on earth

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Does the US get

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
Pokemon and Nobunaga's Ambition

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
Relatively close to the Japanese release

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
You know within a year yes I would call close

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
To this yet we had to pull

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Out fucking teeth to get

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Xenoblade

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
Is this an

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
Example of maybe

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
I mean I guess technically it wasn't

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
A Nintendo game because Tecmo designed it

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
Maybe that's the key difference

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
Because Pokemon just shits

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
Money and it's the Pokemon factor

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
I mean it's

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
Even if the whole feudal warlord fails

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
To grab onto people it can still be

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
Propped up and kept afloat

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
At least a little bit more with something like

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
Oh I don't know a Pokemon franchise

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
Which is insanely popular

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
As opposed to a

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
I'm not going to say an underground favorite

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
But definitely a less trafficked

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
Series in the Zen of Years

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
Zen of Sagas and of course

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
Why?

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
I understand why they changed the name

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Because you don't exactly have your

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
Raving Nobunaga Ambition fans here

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
In the US I mean there was that

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
They had like a few of them on the NES

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
Like Nobunaga and Romance of the

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Three Kingdoms and some of that but

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
That series has kind of been deader than dead here

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
For years or at least I think it exists on the

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
PC it definitely has like a cult

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
Following but nothing mainstream

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
So I get why they

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Changed the name but you know there's going to be those purists

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Though there's always some goddamn purist who's

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
Going to be like why couldn't they just call

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
It Pokemon Nobunaga

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
They think it's they dumbed it down for stupid Americans

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
Stupid Americans

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Get off your goddamn horse

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
They changed it for Americans indeed

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Yes they did change it for Americans

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Because we don't have like two

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
New Nobunaga Ambition games coming

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
Out on consoles every year like they do

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
In Japan wake up

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
It's fucking amazing this game

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
Is coming out here in the first place that's basically my point

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
And it sounds like it has six on six

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Battles and

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
Battle conditions can change on every turn

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
Keeping players on their toes in anticipation

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Of what will happen next

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
Me me me me me me

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Fancy pants reading of the quote

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
And this article from Scott Moffett

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Nintendo of America's executive vice president

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Of sales and marketing

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Pokemon fans are always

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Interested in playing in new

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Environments and experiencing new

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Adventures. Pokemon conquest

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Gives them an entirely new way

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
To enjoy this beloved series

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
With exciting new settings

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
Fierce battles and nearly 200

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
Pokemon to team up with

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
Read that first phrase again in that quote

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
Real quick. In that voice or normally?

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
Whatever you want

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
Pokemon fans are always interested

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
In playing in new environments

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
And experiencing new adventures

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
Okay okay you know what that translates to?

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Pokemon fans will open up their wallets

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
And give us all their- They will buy fucking everything

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
They will buy any fucking thing that we put

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
In front of them and they will like it

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
If this was something that we were

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
That we were you know head over heels

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Interested in we have a quote

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
For this too

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Shut up and take my money!

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
Exactly. As I screw up the quote the first time

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
I got it

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
But I know people like that

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Shane's like that

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
He probably has his pre-order in already

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
Not that there's anything wrong with that

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Alright let's go on to the next story

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
Was that mine? I'm keeping up

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
I swear. My computer isn't though

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
Um

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
Max Payne is being brought out

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
Again and being adapted to

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
IOS was this one

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
I think this one uh yeah an Android

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
Version is actually gonna come a couple of weeks later

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
The current rumor says that

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
Max Payne for IOS is going to

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Come out on April 12th I believe that

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
Is Wednesday of this coming week

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
As to

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
Be expected it's gonna- The game is gonna be

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Scaled down and adapted so that you can get your

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Bullet time portable on

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
Purely on screen controls no talk

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
About any kind of a controller or anything to do

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
That but you can start diving around

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
And rolling around and uh

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Falling off the- Oh what was that

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
Scene where you were going in like a drug

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Crazed and you had that terrible

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Walkway to navigate against that's gonna be

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
Really really bad with touch controls

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Most ports are really really bad

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
With touch controls that's what

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Makes the story interesting because like

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
I- That was the other game

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
I didn't mention in my gaming week is that um

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
Midway read

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
For the 200th time

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
Re-released their whole classic arcade game machine

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
Uh, classic arcade game compilation

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
And I picked it up in all the packs

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
So I have um

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
YARV, Gauntlet, um

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
The sequel to Smash TV, same characters

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
Uh, I completely

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Forgot what it was called but then most specifically

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
Like my favorite game- Total carnage!

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Thank you. My favorite game with a

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Mouthful of popcorn again

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
Total popcorn!

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Like I- Like I was

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Just saying one of my favorite classic games in the arcade

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
Was All Points Bulletin and that is

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
In this collection but it uses

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
It uses the accelerometer

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Or the dryer or one of the two and it uses

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
You have to tilt the phone to steer

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
And that-

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
That sucks! It's like

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
I would have been less torn up if there

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
Was an optional D-pad but the fact

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
That it's purely tilt is just a pain in the ass

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
Yeah that's the- I think I have that same one

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
It's the like Williams collection or something it's called

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
I thought it was Midway specifically

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
It's only on my iPad it's over in the other room

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
I have it it's called

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
Midway Arcade it looks just like that right?

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
Okay I have it too and Spy Hunter

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
Speaking of that game is in the- Playing that on the train too

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
And it fucking sucks

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
Yep

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
Like that's not how I want to play the game Hey look there's the fork in the road

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
Let me get off to the left. No why are you going to the right?

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
No, no I said to

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Crash! There are- Okay there are

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
Two games that are actually

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Three games that are tolerable in that collection

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
One of them is Joust

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
Because think about it

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
In Joust you didn't have up or down

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
You had left, right, and flap

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
So that works okay because

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
There's only so many buttons you can- You're not going to like

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
Accidentally screw up and hit up left when you meant to hit

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
Just left because you have a fat thumb

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
Or any of that right? There's left, right, and flap

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
So Joust works surprisingly alright

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
The other two are Ski Ball

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
And that- Basketball or- Dumb little

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
Basketball game

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
Which aren't even fucking Midway games they're just

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
But you still get tickets from them

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Exactly! You can get the virtual

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
Prizes from the prize stand

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
You know what I've learned to do to get virtual tickets

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
Here's your players tip for Midway Arcade

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
Just fucking sit there and start Ski Ball

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
And go, just swipe your finger

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
Nine times really fast, restart

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
Nine times really fast, restart

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
I managed to get a 900 game within about

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
Five or six times of trying

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
There you go. So Max Payne this week

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
Android about a week and a half later

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
And everything else

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Touch world is okay, moving on

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Can I ask this real quick before we get into the

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
Next story? Ridgey you wanna say something?

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
No. Oh okay. Um

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
Did you hear the news around the internet this week

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
About how Instagram came out for Android?

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
Mhmm

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
And was suddenly bashed by

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
All the iPhone users everywhere that was like

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Ugh

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
I can't believe Instagram is slumming

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
It up on Android

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
Hipstergram is now Losergram

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Ugh

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
They need to come out with something new on the iPhone

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
Because I refuse to use an

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
App that exists on Android

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
What the fuck is up with that attitude?

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
Like I don't, where does that come from?

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
All the same holy wars that divide

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Them in the first place. The same brainwashing

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
That has them upgrade a personal appliance

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
Every fucking nine months for $500

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
And they see nothing wrong with that

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Same attitude. I'm gonna club

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
You with my iPhone if you keep talking

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
I'll help

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
But I'm not like that

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
I think everybody, I love it

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
When Android users get the same apps

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
Because sometimes we can still like play together

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
And stuff. I'm totally fine with

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
Android users having the apps

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
All my Android buddies have all the same

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
Words with friends hanging with friends

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
I'm sorry I haven't joined the

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Zynga must die petition completely yet

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
I haven't started draw something

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
For that reason but I still play words with friends

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
Hanging with friends and scramble with friends

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
It's alright I'll just judge you from back here

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Exactly. All the way across the table give that

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
Evil glare for the rest of the show

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
He still gives money to Zynga

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
I would ask Jason to host the show again

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
But he fucking plays Zynga games

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
Like he's so not cool

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
And then there are some other games we've

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
Played like there was, I can't even

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
Recall the name of it but there was some pool simulator

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
That had like 8 ball 9 ball and

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
Different table arrangements and that kind of stuff

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
And yeah those are all cross platform

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
And since they're asynchronous

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
And just alternating they work

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
Very well. They're very nice and they get everybody

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Involved. Okay going to our chatroom at

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
Cat.orangeslaungeradio.com. Tigerclaw says

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
Sky it's Apple fanboys

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
They are elitists. No they're not

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
I'm an Apple

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
Fanboy and I'm the guy that buys

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
The iPhone every time. And your desktop is a

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
Windows machine

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
I'm by

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
I'm by

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
Alan I have to tell you something

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
I'm by. Computeral

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
By portable. And you have the sense to

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
Skip a release before you

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
Upgrade. Yeah alright

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
So dig yourself out of that hole

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
Although also recall

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
One of the first couple of words out of my mouth

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
After I walked in here last time

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Wow I'm in Windows world. This feels

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
Weird. Okay then fanboy

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
Do you consider, you're worse than I am clearly

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
Do you consider yourself an elitist?

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
You have to think about this. I can't

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
I can talk like it. I don't mean it

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
I mean when I was

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
When I had my whole phone switching

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
debacle I actively looked at what Sprint

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
Had offerings for both Android and Windows

55:33.000 --> 55:35.000
And because I had an iPad

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
I was more than willing to get a different

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
Phone because I still had something to let

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
Me get done with the tools that I wanted to use

55:41.000 --> 55:43.000
But

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
Sprint's selection was fucking garbage

55:45.000 --> 55:47.000
And they have the 4S so I was like okay I'm done

55:47.000 --> 55:49.000
I figured it out

55:49.000 --> 55:51.000
And that's the story of how I have the

55:51.000 --> 55:53.000
Latest phone. There you go

55:53.000 --> 55:55.000
Alright let's

55:55.000 --> 55:57.000
Let's go. It's not the Apple

55:57.000 --> 55:59.000
Show. Let's move on to this story. That's my

55:59.000 --> 56:01.000
Other show that I do. Oh that's

56:01.000 --> 56:03.000
Right. You really do have an Apple

56:03.000 --> 56:05.000
Show. I do. I should let you guys plug your

56:05.000 --> 56:07.000
Podcast because he has one too. I'll let you

56:07.000 --> 56:09.000
Do that at the start of the next half of the

56:09.000 --> 56:11.000
Show. Alright for now

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
Let's talk about the Wii U

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
And a rumor about the Wii U

56:15.000 --> 56:17.000
And usually I don't like to talk about rumors

56:17.000 --> 56:19.000
Like these but it was kind of a slow news week

56:19.000 --> 56:21.000
Because everybody was in Boston with the PAX East

56:21.000 --> 56:23.000
Thing. Which by the way we will have some phone calls

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
On that later. But for now

56:25.000 --> 56:27.000
We better. Rumors. Yeah we better

56:27.000 --> 56:29.000
Because I didn't go this year. I'm kind of sad

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
Some of the other all game shows had it

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
Covered but you know

56:33.000 --> 56:35.000
I might go to West Coast

56:35.000 --> 56:37.000
This year which is really exciting so

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
We'll hear from the folks

56:39.000 --> 56:41.000
That were at PAX East a little later

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
For now let's talk about the Wii U

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
Launch date

56:45.000 --> 56:47.000
Rumor spreading around the internet like wildfire

56:47.000 --> 56:49.000
We're talking being picked up by Eurogamer

56:49.000 --> 56:51.000
GameSpot and so on

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
The rumor is the Wii U

56:53.000 --> 56:55.000
Is out November 18th

56:55.000 --> 56:57.000
That day sounds awfully familiar

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
That's

56:59.000 --> 57:01.000
Five years later isn't it?

57:01.000 --> 57:03.000
Didn't the Wii U launch right around that day?

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
Did the Wii U launch? Or did the regular Wii U launch

57:05.000 --> 57:07.000
November 18th? I don't remember

57:07.000 --> 57:09.000
It was just before Thanksgiving

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
Because it was just before I moved out of Arizona

57:11.000 --> 57:13.000
Apparently it's coming from

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
A Japanese retailer email

57:15.000 --> 57:17.000
Or something like that is where this date is coming from

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
So you know take it or leave it

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
But November 18th is the day

57:21.000 --> 57:23.000
So

57:23.000 --> 57:25.000
Here's my honest reaction to that

57:25.000 --> 57:27.000
I don't think Nintendo knows the day yet

57:27.000 --> 57:29.000
I don't think Nintendo's picked the day yet

57:29.000 --> 57:31.000
I think Nintendo in part is

57:31.000 --> 57:33.000
Waiting to hear what Microsoft

57:33.000 --> 57:35.000
And Sony are doing although I guess they have to

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
Release a date at E3

57:37.000 --> 57:39.000
Maybe they don't have to

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
I want to say they didn't announce the Wii release date till after E3

57:41.000 --> 57:43.000
That year

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
I don't even remember

57:45.000 --> 57:47.000
The Wii

57:47.000 --> 57:49.000
Came out on November

57:49.000 --> 57:51.000
19th of 2006

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
Oh so close

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
Well okay at least that shows that

57:55.000 --> 57:57.000
They're aiming for the same weekend essentially

57:57.000 --> 57:59.000
So

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
I would not put it past a retailer

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
To stub a date based off

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
What they saw before

58:05.000 --> 58:07.000
To have some record in their system

58:07.000 --> 58:09.000
So they can start saying pre-order

58:09.000 --> 58:11.000
Pre-order give us your money

58:11.000 --> 58:13.000
Or at least some of it

58:13.000 --> 58:15.000
So

58:15.000 --> 58:17.000
Yep there you go

58:17.000 --> 58:19.000
Another day Wii U

58:19.000 --> 58:21.000
What else can you say?

58:21.000 --> 58:23.000
Alright moving on

58:23.000 --> 58:25.000
So there's been a lot

58:25.000 --> 58:27.000
Of anger over

58:27.000 --> 58:29.000
Street Fighter X Tekken that Capcom put out

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
A couple weeks ago

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
In regards to all of the

58:33.000 --> 58:35.000
Launch day launch week DLC

58:35.000 --> 58:37.000
Available

58:37.000 --> 58:39.000
That is on the disc that you have to pay to

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
Unlock and I know if Loki were here

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
He would be pitching a fit right now

58:43.000 --> 58:45.000
Because this is obviously a thorn in his side

58:45.000 --> 58:47.000
There have been a lot of

58:47.000 --> 58:49.000
Better business bureau complaints

58:49.000 --> 58:51.000
About this and Capcom has finally released a statement

58:51.000 --> 58:53.000
It's very

58:53.000 --> 58:55.000
Professionally coded

58:55.000 --> 58:57.000
And groomed

58:57.000 --> 58:59.000
To say

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
We're sorry you feel that way

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
But

59:03.000 --> 59:05.000
We didn't do anything wrong

59:05.000 --> 59:07.000
Nanny nanny boo boo

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
The first draft of that said fuck you

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
You fucking fucks

59:11.000 --> 59:13.000
But that got scrapped

59:13.000 --> 59:15.000
Yeah they rubbed it through the PR machine

59:15.000 --> 59:17.000
Some bubbles came out

59:17.000 --> 59:19.000
Basically they're saying that

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
They make sure that the majority of

59:21.000 --> 59:23.000
Content is on the disc

59:23.000 --> 59:25.000
There's 38 fighters to play out of the box

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
It doesn't matter if the DLC is available

59:27.000 --> 59:29.000
On the day after the release date

59:29.000 --> 59:31.000
Or three weeks

59:31.000 --> 59:33.000
You still have to pay whatever

59:33.000 --> 59:35.000
Five, six bucks, PSN points

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
Xbox Live points

59:37.000 --> 59:39.000
To access the content

59:39.000 --> 59:41.000
So there's no difference between

59:41.000 --> 59:43.000
Content that's on the disc that you have to pay to unlock

59:43.000 --> 59:45.000
Versus stuff that's downloaded later

59:45.000 --> 59:47.000
And they're saying

59:47.000 --> 59:49.000
That the

59:49.000 --> 59:51.000
Disc, the product of the game

59:51.000 --> 59:53.000
When that has to go gold

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
When they actually say this game is done

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
And then the release date which comes a couple months later

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
Even if that

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Extra content that comes later still makes it on the disc

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
It's

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
From their point of view

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
It was always

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Intended to be something

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Supplementary to the original product

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
And it's not wrong

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Because Xbox and PSN lets them do this

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
And they're sorry but

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
You have to pay to unlock it either way

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Whether it's day one or day 22

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
So

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
What do you think? You personally

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
You're a fighting game fan

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
I know that

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Given what happened with Street Fighter 4

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
And Mortal Kombat

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:35.000
I basically learned to just say

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Screw fighting games and wait until two years later

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Which I know some people in chat are like

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
I don't know the name but

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.000
They're going to release a comprehensive

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Game of the year full bullshitty DLC edition

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
I'd rather buy that

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
They have sworn they're not doing it this time

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Unless you want to get the Vita version

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Or whatever

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Then sure, that's what Loki says

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Get the Vita version

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
You have a Vita, we can get it

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
That was code for

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Rob, buy it for your Vita

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
And let me play it

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Let me play it when you're at work

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
I guess it's

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
It's sleazy but like they said

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:13.000
It's not wrong

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
You know, I'm playing Mass Effect 2

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Which has a lot of

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
Several hour long DLC episode

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Packs for it, missions with bonus weapons

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
And blah blah blah

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
But the game itself is already so long that you don't

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
You don't really need it

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
And it's just being a completionist and knowing that

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000
I want to play Troll Mega Man so bad

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
But I don't have to but I want to

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.000
And it's on the disc

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
It's frustrating to know that

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
It's right there on the disc but they want you to pay

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.000
I mean that's the frustrating thing about it

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
At least the Mass Effect 2 stuff you actually download

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000
And while there might be seeds of information

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
On the disc, you're still downloading

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
A good chunk of the dialogue and you know

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
All that you're actually downloading

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
You're not able to hack it off the disc

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
In my opinion

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Capcom may think this is the more convenient

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Way to do it or whatever but

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
The hacking community is kind of

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Teaching them a lesson here

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.000
If you go that route

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Here's the price you're going to pay for it

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
And it kind of sucks that legitimate users

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Get screwed in the end

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
And that's where Capcom is starting to look like idiots

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000
Like always

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
And on that note, there's actually related news reports

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Coming out about this

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
About the fact that Capcom has posted

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
I believe it's on their own forums as well as also

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000
The official Xbox Live boards

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Is that they want people to enforce

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
To help enforce against the hackers

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
And report people who are using these

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Hacked unlocked characters

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.000
And are using them on online matches

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000
They can't do their own fucking job?

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.000
But if this is the more convenient way to do it

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Then police it your goddamn self

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
I guess to save themselves a lot of wank

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
From their fans

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Have it be available on launch day

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Digitally

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Do not put that shit on the disc

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
For any reason at all

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
And even if people want to make the argument that

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Well, it's Tuesday morning and I have the disc

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.000
And now you're saying there's $40 worth of

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
DLC for me to get

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Why wasn't it on the disc? They could just say

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Well, because you have to download it

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
It's not on the disc

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
And that will remove a lot of the argument that the hackers have right now

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000
AcidicVampire in our chat room says

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Ultimately, it's their decision to make it pay to unlock

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
It sucks, but if you want to have it your way

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
You should wait until the final Ultimate Edition

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Is eventually released

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Yeah, exactly

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.000
The vote with your wallet statement

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Which I think a lot of us are on board with

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Yeah, I didn't buy it

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
And this is a big part of the reason I didn't buy it

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Was because Capcom has historically shown

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
That even if they swear up and down

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
They're not going to do it this time

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
I don't believe them

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
I'm not going to buy it until there's the Ultimate Edition

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Or I'm at least going to wait until the disc is down to like $20

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Then I'll buy that

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
And then the $20 to unlock everything

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
That'll be about the game right there, right?

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
This story

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000
The hackers, I guess, that have

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Figured out how to play those

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Pay to unlock characters online

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Without having to actually

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Get the DLC

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Apparently Jill and Shumagoreth

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
From MVC3

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Were on the disc launch day

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
As Pay to unlock characters

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
But they were incomplete assets

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000
So to pull down that final 20%

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000
That made them playable

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
That was a remote file package

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
That you could bring down to your console

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Which is probably what they should have done here

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
I'm assuming

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
If they wanted to keep the hackers truly not playing it online

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Or what have you

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Let's see

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Other comments in our chatroom at chat.orangenautry.com

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Porkchop says

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000
Capcom left characters on the disc

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
And the hackers saw it as a personal challenge

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
And they took it, they ran with it

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
And gee

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
What number of times is this that we've heard it?

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Millionth and a half?

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Absolutely, well you know the old saying

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Hackers gonna hack

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Right? Haters gonna hate and hackers

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000
Gonna hack. So when you say

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Your system is unhackable

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
That is like printing a wedding invitation

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000
To all the hackers says you are cordially invited

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000
To hack the fuck out of this box

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Not only did they take the box, but they took the whole damn network

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
And almost the company

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
I mean, what set everybody off about

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
PlayStation when they removed Linux?

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
You wanna piss off a hacker?

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Take their Linux away?

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
I mean for real

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Take away their command line

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Take away their way of exploring

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
And they'll make a new way

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Brute or not

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
And for people that work in IT

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
That are hardcore crypto people

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
They don't even have to be gamers

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
They see this stuff as a Rubik's Cube

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
It's exactly like you said

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
It's a gauntlet thrown down, it's a challenge

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Once they release into the crack community

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Here's how you

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Unlock this

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
They may not even be gamers, they're just really into crypto

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
And the community is there

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
And they're always gonna find a way around it

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:55.000
It is pretty surprising that they're

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Not only hacking, but they're going activist

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
With it and actually playing these

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
And matches and using it as advertising

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
That's pretty ballsy

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
To go on Xbox Live with your gamer tag

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
And be all, look at me, bitch

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
I know a lot of people that have a lot of safeguards in place

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
That on a console that is hacked

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Actively prevent them from going on

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Xbox Live first

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:17.000
And nothing goes wrong

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
And then they have to knowingly unlock it

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
And undo any mods or however the process actually works

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
But yeah, this is

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Probably attributable to the last six months

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Or so of tech news

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
But they're not only hacking, they're going activist

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
On it as well

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
That's the more interesting story for me personally

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Interesting

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Because now people in our chat room are talking

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
About what is likely next

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
And Wylan says, I won't buy Darkstalkers 4

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
But Stan says, I'll totally

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Buy Darkstalkers 4 even if there's stupid DLC

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
I've been waiting for that forever

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Act F says, I'll buy Darkstalkers 4

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
When the Ultimate Edition comes out

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:53.000
This is interesting

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Have the reputation of fighting games

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Been tarnished due to not just the behavior

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000
Of Capcom, but if you think about it, Mortal Kombat

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
And WB Games

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Didn't really do anything different, granted they didn't leave it

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
On the disc, but they did release

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Extra fighters just to turn around

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
This is February or March, they had the comprehensive

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Freddy Krueger, Scarlet

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:13.000
You know, Kenji

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000
DLC edition

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
So it's not just Capcom, if you think about it

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:19.000
I still stand by my argument

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
That EVO has something to do with the timing

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
And the extensive release

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
And all that kind of stuff

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
I really do feel that that factors in

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Because fighting games have thankfully stepped back into the mainstream

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
And EVO, if there's something bigger than that

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
I don't know what it is

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000
At least here in the States, of course

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
I don't have a specific point

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
That comes off that

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Ties into all of this

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Has Namco and Tekken and Soul Calibur

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Done this shit? I don't think they have

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
They're still the one franchise that's relatively

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Tarnished

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Well, Soul Calibur

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Well, if you had Yoda, you could pay to

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Get Vader, and if you had Vader

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Because of the version you bought, you could pay to unlock Yoda

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.000
But that was really it

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
It was one character, and everyone knew that was gonna happen

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Well, you know what they're doing now

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Is it's all the-

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000
Yeah, because 5 just came out and I have no idea what they're doing with it

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
They're doing princess packs

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.000
If you want to dress up your pretty princess

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
In all the gear, you have to download the

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Costume packs

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
But that's

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
That's still shitty

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
But it's cosmetic

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Whereas in this, it's players, characters

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Right, I mean, it's not

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
I think what they're doing is not

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Nearly as bad as what's happening here

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000
Over at Capcom

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000
And if you're into the design character stuff

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Which I know some of our listeners are

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
They sent a bunch of custom characters

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
He made, and a lot of them are just hilarious

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Like, they're great

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Real life interpretations made in the game

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
And with even more stuff

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:47.000
I can just imagine the additional

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Opportunities that opens up

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000
But that's totally different than

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000
You know, a whole different character is here

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
On the disc, you know

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
But I don't think they really had

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
DLC characters, there might have been like

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000
One that came with the collector's edition

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000
I can't remember

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000
The best buy, I want to say

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
The really over the top silly

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Like vaudeville character

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
I would imagine that after a couple of months he would be made

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Available for DLC, but there's a precedent

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
For that, that they did with Vader and Yoda

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Right

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Alright, let's move on

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Let's talk about what games are coming out to a retailer

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
Near you that will require you to buy it in the store

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
And then buy all the DLC later

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
Okay, maybe not

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000
What's coming out in the US, Jason?

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
Especially considering the selection that I have to work with

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
If these games have DLC that would scare

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
That would scare me to death

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Pretty light week

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000
As far as I see from the next week

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Three games that

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
I don't know if I should even go on with them

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
But here they are

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
3DS, Spirit Camera, The Cursed Memoir

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:49.000
With bonus

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Drops on the 13th

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Oh, that's just a strategy guide

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Why is that in a game?

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
You fail-tastic

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000
Also for the Nintendo DS, Titanic Mystery

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Maybe with DLC you can

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000
Float the ship back up with ping pong balls

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
I solved the mystery

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
It sinks

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.000
It was Colonel Mustard in the ballroom

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000
With the anchor

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000
And lastly

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000
With the iceberg

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
I don't even remember the blue character's name

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.000
So there's not even really a way to narrow that down anymore

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Mrs. Peacock?

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Yeah, that's not water related at all

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Oh, okay

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000
There was a tie in there somewhere, but I'm not witty enough

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Speaking of boat sinking, I think that joke just sank

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
To the bottom of the Pacific

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
I'll never let go, Jack

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
I'll never let go

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000
We were watching Titan AE last night

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:49.000
And the very ending had a very similar situation

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000
I'll never let go

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
I'll never let go

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000
I'll save you

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
At any rate

01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Lastly, oh, so Titanic Mystery

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Is...

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000
That's not next week, that's two days ago

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Okay, I apologize, this just failed a lot

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Spirit camera for the DS

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Titanic Mystery for the DS

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000
4-in-1 action pack for the PS3

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Drops on Tuesday

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000
Quiet week

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
An unexciting week

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000
Well, let's go to Japan and see if it's any different over there

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
On the 12th in Japan

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
On the Nintendo 3DS

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000
Nintendo Sudoku 3D

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Dai Ni Shu

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Eitsuno Puzzle Day 1000mon

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
That is, for real, the name of the game

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.000
It's fucking Sudoku in 3D

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Okay

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Like

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Can somebody explain to me

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:43.000
How Sudoku is fucking enhanced in three dimensions?

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Because you can have a cube instead of just a flat surface

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.000
No, it's not even that

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Well, it could be a cube

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Your brain couldn't fucking handle the Sudoku coob

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.000
I could do that

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.000
The Sudoku

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000
Sudoku Coos? What?

01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Sudoku

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Moving on to others

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000
That's all that's on the 3DS this week

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.000
With a title that long

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.000
I thought it was Sudoku with schoolgirl titties

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:09.000
Or whatever Japanese has

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000
That would have been far more interesting

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000
I would play a Sudoku game if

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
After you beat the puzzle

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:17.000
Sexy lady dance, titties in 3D

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Maybe that's the hidden feature

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.000
Or you know

01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Guys in their underwear

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Shaking it in 3D

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000
Whatever it is you're into

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
You could have a switch

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.000
I think you just alienated 80% of the listeners

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Look, it's like Mass Effect

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
You get a choice

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000
You can point the thing up or down

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000
If you were worried about tonight being a dry night

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Dry night

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
How about the Vita?

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000
How about it? In Japan this week

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Rayman Origins

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
And, and ready?

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Nikolai no Sudoku 5

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000
Shugyoku number 12

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Puzzle, that's right

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000
It's a Sudoku game on the Vita

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000
As well

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000
Is that a swastika? What is that?

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:11.000
That's one of the puzzles

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.000
No, that is not a swastika

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000
That is not Sudoku

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
It's rotated

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000
Look at it diagonally

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000
I need the chat

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Oh, it kind of does look like a swastika

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Don't buy that game you guys

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:29.000
That's not cool

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000
It's in chat, tell us we're wrong

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.000
That is not a Sudoku puzzle, that's the other one

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000
What's that? Kakoru?

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:37.000
There's the missing number crossword

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.000
Kakoru or something like that

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000
I don't remember the name of it, god dammit

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000
How about on the consoles?

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000
Maybe there's something to save us on the

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Playstation 3 this week in Japan

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:53.000
Dirt 3

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.000
You get Sudoku or Dirt

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000
Also

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Grand Slam Tennis 2

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000
And Rayman Origins

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000
On the Playstation 3

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000
And lastly on the Xbox 360

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Nothing, because no one owns

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000
a 360 in Japan

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
No seriously, there's nothing on the 360

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000
this week in Japan

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000
How about Europe? UK

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000
All those countries over there

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.000
Looks like

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000
a light week over on the UK side

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000
or the Europe side as well

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000
On the 11th I have Football

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000
Manager handheld for the Android

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000
Legend of

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000
Grimrock for the PC

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Skullgirls for

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000
Playstation 3 and 360

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000
On the 12th we have

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000
Max Payne Mobile, which we just covered

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000
Tribes Ascend for the PC

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000
On the 13th

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000
Fez

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Fez, not Rez

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.000
Fez, maybe your little Shriners in the little cars

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000
Fez for the 360

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
On the 14th, Pandora's

01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000
Tower for the Wii

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000
Which is kind of

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000
a big deal

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.000
That's one of those Operation Rainfall games

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.000
Pandora's Tower?

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000
So while we wait here in the US

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000
everybody's going to be pirating it

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000
Because that's what

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000
people do

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000
Alright, I'm just kidding kids, don't pirate

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:15.000
But seriously

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.000
Someone on my Facebook just mentioned getting

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000
Center Blade Chronicles

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000
Like they just bought it in the store this week

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000
And I was like, what? Oh yeah

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000
I guess we should only really be playing that

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Starting this week

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Oops

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000
I would have loved to have bought Xenoblade

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000
A year ago

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000
Nintendo, you've made the bed

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000
Now lie in it

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000
Moving on, let's do one other

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000
Quick story before we get to the classic game of the week

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
DarkSakura's not here tonight

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000
I know she's in the chat and she can scream all she wants

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000
But we're taking the

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000
Classic game of the week car and driving it

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000
In another direction tonight, so here we go

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Jason, one more story though

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000
By the way, the chat room

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000
Oh there was, hey, look at the main intention

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000
Well I'll say this real quick, the chat room is

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
Lighting up, saying there is

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000
What we know as a swastika

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000
In Japanese can be a manji

01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000
Which is actually a good luck

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000
And some old video games had that

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000
For instance there was some

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000
Dungeons and Zelda, somebody was saying in our chat room

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000
Kind of looked like that

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000
I remember it was 1942 and 1943

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000
Had those symbols

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000
In the Japanese versions

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
And they were like extra life or something

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000
So, and it's not controversial there

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000
Because it has a different meaning

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000
It looks mirrored to me

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.000
Yes, I believe it's the other direction

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000
But obviously that's a pretty easy mistake

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000
For commoners, so generally

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000
Games that would have had it and come to America

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000
Get it just changed to something else entirely

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000
Or just stripped out

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000
Was there another comment on that one?

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000
No

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000
Yes, one last story because I swear I am keeping up with things

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.000
New York has booted all of its registered sex offenders

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000
Off online gaming networks

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000
Microsoft, Sony, Blizzard, EA, and Apple

01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000
All cooperated with the purge

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000
Which follows a court case

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000
In the state of New York

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000
In which a 19 year old pleaded guilty

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000
To abusing a 10 year old

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000
He met on Xbox Live

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:09.000
New York law demands all convicted sex offenders

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.000
To hand over any email addresses

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
And online aliases

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000
To help limit their access on vulnerable web networks

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.000
However, this is the first time it's ever been invoked

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:19.000
In relation to online gaming

01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000
Pretty, pretty

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000
Didn't, we

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000
We never went through this

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000
Six years ago with Uno

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:29.000
And yet we're finally here

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.000
Oh god, strip Uno, I remember that story

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Look, here's the thing though

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000
Obviously

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.000
People that would do that stuff to kids

01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:39.000
Are not okay and they need to be dealt with

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
In ways like this, I get that

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000
But, there's another side to this

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000
That kind of bothers me

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.000
What parent was letting their 10 year old

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Play on Xbox Live unsupervised?

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000
Hello

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.000
Did they just not know

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.000
What happens on Xbox Live?

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
I'm like, ignorance is not an excuse

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.000
You know what I mean?

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000
That should be a wake up call

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000
To parents everywhere

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:05.000
You need to supervise children

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000
That are going to play games online like that

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Again, I'm not saying

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.000
What the 19 year old

01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:13.000
19 year old did was right

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.000
That's no excuse, but I'm just saying

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000
There's kind of a couple things wrong in this picture

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000
Although, take it on the flip side

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000
And I can say something from my youth

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.000
While I wasn't 10 years old

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.000
I was still really young

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.000
And my parents were divorced

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
And I was living with my mom

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000
And on the times that she had custody of me

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000
And even sometimes when my dad

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Had custody of us

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.000
Sometimes it was just myself

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000
And my sister who is 3 years older than me

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000
But sometimes it was just straight up me

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.000
Often times, especially after my

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.000
Sister grew up and moved out

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.000
It was just myself in the house

01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:49.000
All weekend

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.000
This is before the years of online gaming

01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:53.000
Functionally

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:55.000
This is just a modern version of that

01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:57.000
But these situations

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
And I completely understand

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Where you're coming from

01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.000
One, there are bad parents

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000
Two, there are bad situations with good parents

01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000
And

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.000
It would be

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Great if parental controls

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Were a lot more perfect

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
If Microsoft could step in a lot better

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
And have some kind of a camera

01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Filter or if they were just kind of smarter about it

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
But these situations happen

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000
And it's incredibly unfortunate

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000
I can kind of meet you halfway there because

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
When I was probably about 12 or 13

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000
On my Commodore 64

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.000
On my 300 baud modem

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000
I was calling into BBS's

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.000
Local bulletin board systems

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000
And posting on message boards and playing door games

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.000
I was fucking playing Legend of the Red Dragon and shit

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000
At like 14 and 15 right

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Which if you ever played those games back in the day

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Nice games

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
And my mom just said oh he's on the computer

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000
You know and I was posting on message boards and stuff

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.000
And there would be people on the message boards

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.000
It's like yeah you should like come out to this meetup

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.000
And all this stuff and it's like okay I'm 15

01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:57.000
You know and

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.000
You know I can kind of see

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000
That side of it

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000
That sometimes the parents

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.000
If she knew what I was doing online though

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000
She would have punched me in the face

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:09.000
She would have taken the cord

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:11.000
She would have burned the cord in front of my eyes

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000
She knew what kind of stuff

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.000
I was doing on the computer

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.000
How does the outside world exist anymore?

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000
Especially nowadays

01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000
With us I mean look at what we're doing here

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.000
Three nerds around the table and a lot of cords

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000
That are just connecting us to the rest of everybody else

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000
Did you have a comment on this Alan?

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.000
I feel that

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000
A lot of people

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
Will pretend to be high and mighty by saying that

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.000
A TV or a console should not be a babysitter

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000
But it's

01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000
A privilege for a kid to have

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000
Two adults that are in the same household

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000
As them invested in raising them

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000
And sometimes if they have to work

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.000
Full time jobs you know

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.000
To do what's necessary to run that household

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.000
A console or a TV will be a babysitter

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000
For four or five hours a day

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.000
And I don't really think that that's negligent to do so

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:57.000
And even if the parents

01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000
Had taken measures to lock down that kind of stuff

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000
It doesn't necessarily mean the 10 year old

01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000
Doesn't know how to crack their parents

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000
Password and lock it themselves

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000
Like they're not

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000
Idiots at 10

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000
I guess that's true you know but

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000
Don't fucking buy them an Xbox Live subscription

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.000
Do not buy a 10 year old an Xbox Live subscription

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
Ever

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
And if you're gonna get one for yourself

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000
Password lock it if you know there's a kid in the house

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000
It's dangerous

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000
Yeah and if the kid still cracks the password

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.000
There shouldn't be icky

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000
20 plus, 30 plus year old pedos

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Creeping on them

01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:35.000
Well that's still absolutely true and I'm still

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.000
But I'm just saying you know

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000
Everybody needs to accept some responsibility here

01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:41.000
Alright

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000
Anyhow let's move on

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000
Let's move on to a time when

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Xbox Live didn't exist and we didn't have these

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000
Complicated situations

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000
Although the Nintendo

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
Did still babysit us a little bit

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.000
Or in the case of this week's Classic Game of the Week

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.000
An old computer would babysit

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
Okay so here's the deal Dark Soccer's not here tonight

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000
So this is Dark Soccer's Classic Game of the Week

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000
But we're taking over

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
It's my Classic Game of the Week tonight

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
Dark Soccer had picked a game for tonight

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000
But I was like, it's a good game, but I'm like

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000
She can, I wouldn't want to

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000
I wouldn't want to do it without her here

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:15.000
Because then she might have things she wants to say about that game

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:17.000
So we'll let her roll it over to next week

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000
And I'm gonna do a game tonight

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000
That I know she would never pick

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000
Why? Because I picked a game

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000
From the Commodore 64

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
That's right, the game I've picked tonight

01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000
Is tonight's Classic Game of the Week is

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Impossible Mission

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000
I don't know if anybody ever remembers this game

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000
But this game was awesome

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Because it was one of the first games ever

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000
To use a voice synthesizer

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000
And so here you go

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
Here's what you would hear when you would start

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Impossible Mission

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000
Another visitor

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Stay a while

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Stay forever

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
That was the shit

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
When I was a kid

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.000
By the way, he's saying another visitor

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.000
Another visitor

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.000
Stay forever

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:03.000
The last Metroid

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:05.000
Is in captivity

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000
The galaxy is at peace

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000
It was kind of like that

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:11.000
So the original version was on the Commodore 64

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000
And it was done by Epyx in 1984

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000
Epyx was the company that made this game

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Can we even hear the thing?

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
By the way, the sound effects

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
And stuff in this game is very

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
Ambient

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
There's no music

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
So you just have some very ambient noises

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
If you want to jump a little bit there

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Alright, so anyway, here is the deal

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000
In Impossible Mission

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
Not to be confused with Mission Impossible

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Wink Wink Nudge Nudge

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
The big show from the 60s

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000
Impossible Mission, you played a secret agent

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.000
Not to be confused with 007

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:45.000
That is trying to stop an evil genius

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000
Elvin Atombender

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000
Is tampering with

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.000
National security computers

01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000
So you go into the stronghold

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000
And you race against the clock

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.000
Which in turn will make a password

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000
While you avoid deadly

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000
Electrocuting face eating robots

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.000
Ok, they don't eat your face

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000
But they will electrocute you

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000
And you will sometimes fall

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000
Down bottomless pits and all you'll hear is

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Ahhhh

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:15.000
Anyhow

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:17.000
We've got the chorus going on now

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000
Once you finally put the password pieces together

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000
You'll put the completed password in the main

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Control room door, and that's where you

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:27.800
find the evil professor. Where do you find password pieces? In the furniture of

01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:31.480
course. You search the furniture in the rooms you might find lift resets and

01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:35.640
snoozes in the rooms as well. You also will have a room where you can get more

01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:40.100
lift resets and snoozes from doing a musical puzzle. There you go.

01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:43.840
Everything in this game was randomized which kind of made this a lot of fun

01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:49.200
because you could play it over and over again. Sometimes you would have layouts

01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:54.520
of the mansion or the stronghold that like were not winnable. But most of the

01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:59.920
time you got winnable and sometimes you get really easy one too. Rogue apparently

01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:03.600
was an early inspiration for the randomized room layouts. The designer

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:07.480
cited rogue. Do you remember the old old ass rogue game that was on like

01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:11.200
terminals? I don't know that I've originally I've played an original rogue but I've played a

01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:15.680
million roguelikes. Oh yeah well then you kind of know what the deal is there.

01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:21.800
Here is the speech that is in the game. There is the death scream which can also

01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:27.800
be heard in Beachhead 2. They recycled the death scream. There's another visitor

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:34.900
stay a while stay forever and then there's also destroy him my robots. Which

01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:38.800
happens in the very first room you walk into a never again correct? It's a

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:43.640
randomized room. Really? And then there's also when the game is over there's a

01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:50.640
laugh and then if you find him he'll say no no no and then there's a lady voice

01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:54.120
that says mission accomplished congratulations and that's all the

01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:57.280
speech in the game that's all you can fit on one of those freaking five and a

01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:01.760
quarter floppy disks that is like bigger than terabyte hard drives these days.

01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:05.480
There were only two types of enemies and impossible missions there were the laser

01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:11.240
spout and robots and then there was also some some would move slow some would

01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:16.200
move fast and then there's also other types of security guards that would kind

01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:20.000
of just stay in place and then it would wake up when you got really close to it

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:25.200
there. You get six hours to beat the game 36 puzzle pieces every time you die

01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:32.760
ten minutes are deducted from the total time. This game was ported like mad. It

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:39.200
was on the Apple 2, the Atari 7800, the ZX Spectrum, the Acorn Electron, the BBC

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:44.760
Micro, the Amstrad CPC, the NES, and the Sega Master System. Not all of them had

01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:51.840
speech though. Get this the 7800 version on the NTSC platforms had a bug that

01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:56.640
made the game impossible to win. So it really was impossible mission somebody

01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:00.760
took the game name to literally there. Looks like level 30 syndrome started a

01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:05.480
bit earlier than we thought. Aha there was a sequel called impossible mission

01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:11.960
2 in 1988 with new traps and items and also a bigger stronghold. There was a 3d

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:17.000
sequel planned for Epyx's handy system. I don't know if you guys know but Epyx was

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:21.960
going to launch their own system. It eventually became the Atari Lynx so that

01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:28.840
didn't happen. Impossible mission 2025 came out in 1994 for the Amiga which was

01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:34.040
kind of the similar gameplay. Impossible mission did show up later in 2004 it was

01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:38.240
on the Commodore 64 direct-to-tv and it was on the Nintendo Game Boy Advance in

01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:45.480
2004 and the Sony PSP in 2008. Get that. This game is also available on the Wii

01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:49.680
Virtual Console but only in Europe because the Commodore 64 was a fucking

01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:54.320
huge deal in Europe. It was kind of big here but it was huge in Europe April 11

01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:59.200
2008 is when it came out there. This is one of those games that this is the game

01:27:59.200 --> 01:28:03.760
in my opinion and I'm obviously very age biased myself in that it's gotten better

01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:08.280
with time because when I was young playing on a Commodore 64 I was just

01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:12.000
like running jumping and collecting these random numbers and other things.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.080
You had no idea what the fuck you were doing right? I can ride lifts up and down

01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:19.120
inside the side and sometimes not even that couldn't always figure it out but

01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:23.680
now that I've grown up and matured I actually understand what's going on and

01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:28.080
what I have to do and this game is freaking hard but it's a good challenge

01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:31.400
and it's worth revisiting and finally starting to finally starting to get

01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:36.200
played again. I have actually I still have not beaten the game to this day but

01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:40.560
knowing what I have to do going back and doing it with the original Commodore 64

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:45.680
version under emulation I've been making an active an active try to do it and

01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:49.360
come up short so far but I've still had a lot of fun doing it.

01:28:49.360 --> 01:28:52.680
Tigercall on our chat room says Sky do you think Impossible Mission could ever

01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:57.080
get remade? Well I mean I mean we do have the Game Boy and the PSP ones but yeah

01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:01.320
that the Wii the Wii version and all those modern consoles I I would call it

01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:07.080
a remake because it's not it's not just like improved graphics a lot of a lot of

01:29:07.080 --> 01:29:12.200
aspects of the game changed like you don't pick up numbers you pick up puzzle

01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:17.160
pieces that you have to rotate and put into place that form like a map security

01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:20.640
code something or other I got pissed off at the game and I stopped playing it

01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:24.960
it's technically already happened but not in a significant way. I think there

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:28.880
would be a brilliant use on like let's say Xbox Live Arcade or PlayStation

01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:32.240
Network of multiplayer can you imagine if you and three other people all

01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:36.040
attacked the same Citadel at the same time and like you could maybe see the

01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:39.560
shadows of the other players as they're exploring and then you know I think

01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:42.720
this would be a great competitive game especially with the randomization

01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:45.940
element in it and everything I think for like old-school fans I think there's

01:29:45.940 --> 01:29:50.120
really something untapped here that the developers didn't do when they made

01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:54.800
these other ports. For some very obvious reasons perhaps. You should be giving me

01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:58.360
the rights to do this franchise even though I know nothing about game or

01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:02.000
programming games I think that wouldn't that be a fantastic game on Xbox Live

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:06.000
you could like do multiplayer co-op and competitive you do co-op where you're

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:10.380
both collecting puzzle pieces I think this is a great franchise. One person

01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:13.640
manning the computer and controlling some room elements and the other person

01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:17.880
swiftly dodging the robots at a moment's notice and scanning scanning the

01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:21.320
furniture and everything else a lot of potential absolutely. Well there it is

01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:25.080
your classic game of the week for the Commodore 64 where it all started

01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:29.160
although it's available in a shitload of systems after that impossible mission

01:30:29.160 --> 01:30:31.760
Commodore 64 your classic game of the week

01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:38.960
haha Dark Sakura haha took your other classic game and just threw it out the

01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:42.440
window now she'll bring it back next week I know she will it's okay

01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:47.640
considering what the game is it would just float to safety there's your hint

01:30:47.640 --> 01:30:51.680
for next week all right that's gonna do it for part A of Orange Lounge Radio but

01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:53.960
don't go anywhere we got plenty more to come in the second half of the show

California and didn't fly out there this year so I'm sure there's lots that's

01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:10.160
gonna be said about PAX East we do have more news your FUBU question of the

01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:14.480
week more phone calls and plenty more when we come back with more of Orange

01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:17.680
Lounge Radio right after this

01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:27.640
welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live on this April the 8th of

01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:33.480
2012 with the 453rd episode of our show little weird tonight because we're not

01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:37.680
missing just one but two co-hosts but we have two fantastic co-hosts sitting in

01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:41.600
tonight we have Alan of course and Jason filling in that's me I promised you guys

01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:44.560
could talk about some of your side projects because you guys don't just

01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:48.800
co-host here but you both now have your own regular podcast that you do Jason

01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:51.840
we'll start with you you mentioned you do an Apple related thing yeah there's a

01:31:51.840 --> 01:31:57.760
there's a network of nerd topic goodness called a stack exchange and myself I'm

01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:02.320
quite personally vested with a couple of others on their Apple topic site called

01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:06.200
ask different and so myself and two others started up the ask different

01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:11.200
podcast and we've been going since I want to say last summer but suddenly

01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:14.640
that feels wrong for some reason but ask different podcast pretty easy to search

01:32:14.640 --> 01:32:20.920
for ask different comm is the site and there's links to blog chat finding us

01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:25.240
finding the site itself and all that content pretty simple I'm assuming

01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:28.640
that's a little pun on the think different yeah and that that's that was

01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:32.960
that was the name chosen for the site the highest voted name for to actually

01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:37.560
to actually call this site there there's like I could rant for like 30 minutes on

01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:40.720
how we came to that name but I'll spare all you guys because it's not the topic

01:32:40.720 --> 01:32:43.200
and you really do have a great radio voice I'm not just saying that cuz you're

01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:46.800
here but I mean it's convenient but you do have a great real voice I can only

01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:52.120
imagine it's the ass different podcast is great so all right not as a exciting

01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:56.480
and hilarious as the show is at least 99% of the time sometimes we get in a

01:32:56.480 --> 01:33:00.120
good good pun that's okay this show can be pretty boring too now I'm kidding it

01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:05.600
shows always amazing always Alan you you now in the time that you have been for

01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:08.920
your last guest co-hosting on this program you now have your own podcast

01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:13.560
right I've branched out of the olr network how very dare I how very dare

01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:17.880
you I'm surprised I'm surprised you were banned from this program actually I just

01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:23.080
sleep on the couch for a week so pretend you didn't make me do that I am on a

01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:28.920
podcast called fabulous flames and it is a World of Warcraft podcast maybe I

01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:35.920
guess a competitor of courthouse yeah I know it's my hair yeah I was invited to

01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:40.000
be on it because the host was a fan of what I had to say on whorehouse so

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:44.600
there's three of us and it's just I guess World of Warcraft from a male

01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:48.440
point of view I don't really know what the gimmick is but yeah we it's a gay

01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:53.760
Wow podcast that's what the gimmick is fabulous flames is an actual spell from

01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:59.360
an encounter from this latest expansion and it's the gay dragon that was

01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:04.200
originally supposed to sound like Paul in from match game and Blizzard like cut

01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:07.440
his voice our listeners are listeners are too young to get that reference

01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:11.280
honey so Blizzard cut his voice acting going no this is not good so we're

01:34:11.280 --> 01:34:16.000
joking that we're the gay dragons and don't just stand in the flames bask in

01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:19.160
them so it's it's World of Warcraft discussion and you can find us at

01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:24.520
fabulous flames on Twitter and fabulous flames calm or on iTunes how very dare

01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:32.560
you work that tagline so one gay dragons two talking dragons is my lack of Wow

01:34:32.560 --> 01:34:36.640
biting me somewhere here it's the Twilight dragon twins it's a brother and

01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:42.920
sister and the brother is on fire so I I've often been obviously I have a side

01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:46.080
project I do not just orange on studio but I have a podcast about the World of

01:34:46.080 --> 01:34:49.780
Warcraft called the best little whorehouse in Azeroth and our tagline is

01:34:49.780 --> 01:34:54.880
it's all things World of Warcraft but never too seriously so you know that's

01:34:54.880 --> 01:34:59.880
what we've got and I often get asked the question is it weird that you and your

01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:05.880
boyfriend are on competing podcasts and I'm like no because I support all

01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:09.680
independent podcasts and that's what I've been preaching on orange launch

01:35:09.680 --> 01:35:14.360
radio for years so I fucking love it that he's doing his own show it's great

01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:21.080
I love it no it is it is fabulous flames is still very much on its sea legs we're

01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:25.320
only on our fourth or fifth episode so we have we have a long way to grow

01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:31.240
you're still basic bitches but you'll grow I've been I am so rude to the the

01:35:31.240 --> 01:35:35.200
main host of their sunshine I'm I am such a bitch to him on Twitter but it's

01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:39.080
fun because you know we're frenemies we're frenemy podcasts is what we call

01:35:39.080 --> 01:35:43.840
each other and so I've said I I have all these names for fabulous wives I call

01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:50.480
them the fabulous flops it's my favorite name them so anyhow alright so there you

01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:55.760
go and honestly I really do I think it's great because it's not like most people

01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:59.000
I know that listen to podcasts listen at work and they've got plenty of time to

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:02.420
listen to plenty of shows and I would rather somebody be listening to an

01:36:02.420 --> 01:36:07.320
independent podcast then some of that crap that certain websites that won't be

01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:14.840
named produce honey yeah you try I had to dig in one more come on come on

01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:19.640
alright anyhow so there you go let's um also I would do shoutouts for PAX East

01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:24.200
since we're giving other shows shoutouts I do want to say I heard little bits and

01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:26.840
pieces of what the B team which is one of the other shows on the all games

01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:32.360
network did they were live at PAX East and did some good shows so check that

01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:37.000
out I also know electric sistahood which is also on the all games network did a

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:42.120
show while they were there I don't think it was live but I think maybe it was I

01:36:42.120 --> 01:36:46.960
don't remember sorry girls but they did one and it will be on their podcast feed

01:36:46.960 --> 01:36:50.400
and on the network this week for sure and I think I heard Ranma who calls in

01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:54.000
this show all the time and we'll be on the show tonight guest it on it so I'm

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:57.720
glad to see the all games network big happy family getting together at PAX I

01:36:57.720 --> 01:37:02.040
will say the one year we did the all games thing at PAX Prime was a great

01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:05.820
year I mean oh man that was a that was like one of my favorite cons ever was

01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:09.840
that PAX Prime 2008 when all the all games people were there we were

01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:13.880
broadcasting it was a great year but I did go to PAX East the first year a

01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:17.200
couple years ago and had a good time so I was sad I couldn't go this year but

01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:21.640
you know there's only so much money and you know I I spent a lot of it going to

01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:26.200
Disneyland what can you do but I am gonna try and go to a PAX Prime this

01:37:26.200 --> 01:37:31.120
year if nothing else all right I'll advertise real far advertising the all

01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:37.600
games network never saw that coming well what do you want me to advertise I have

01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:42.060
no good response tonight I was gonna say something bitchy about one of the

01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:45.720
corporate networks but I'm not gonna go there and I'm just gonna ask that we go

01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:51.400
for some rapid-fire news so you know what's funny about that I'm on a loaner

01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:55.640
laptop right now and I just pulled the power cord out so I can tell you the

01:37:55.640 --> 01:38:00.120
first story purely from recollection is that Diablo 3 was finally dated for mid

01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:03.400
May what's the next quest what's the next question for the great dungeon

01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:08.880
crawl torchlight when is it they haven't said yet soon soon shortly after Diablo

01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:13.560
3 which is still soon but not soon enough you want to give me the headlines

01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:21.080
of the next two because I can hard angle oh what there you go

01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:27.040
theater rhythm Final Fantasy finally dated for the what is that midsummer

01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:31.440
July 3rd mm-hmm game was actually completely off my radar but looking at

01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:35.680
the looking at the screenshots looks fun I did get a particular amount of

01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:39.240
amusement of the fact that cloud stripes face was completely obscured in the one

01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:43.520
screenshot I did see by the target exceeding the the the note exceeding the

01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:48.800
target zone whatever the particular vocabulary is for that and finally Sega

01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:52.680
says rhythm thief is still happening and that article unfortunately I don't have

01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:56.080
on the top of my head so while my computer starts back up can somebody

01:38:56.080 --> 01:39:01.800
saved my poor dead-air ass there was they were on the paxi Sega was at PAX

01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:05.920
East and there was confirmation that rhythm thief is still happening this is

01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:09.320
despite all the Sega bad news we had last week

01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:14.000
rhythm thief was not canceled so it is still happening it's a 3ds rhythm action

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:19.040
game featuring people in top hats and ties I guess they're like tap dancing on

01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:22.720
disco floors there you go all right some other rapid-fire news for you guys

01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:27.160
fallout the original not the fallout 3 which was still really good but the

01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:31.640
original original game way back in the day was free I say was because you

01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:36.960
missed it it was on good old games or gog.com it was earlier this week

01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:40.200
unfortunately if you're hearing this now though it is no longer free so why am I

01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:44.320
reporting it because I just wanted you to know what you missed out on free

01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:47.920
fallout which is a great great PC get your PC gaming fan I know you know yes

01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:53.200
all serious also it's worth mentioning since we brought up gog they throw a

01:39:53.200 --> 01:39:56.840
little shade at steam this week they were kind of like you know when you give

01:39:56.840 --> 01:40:00.560
these games away for such low cost it doesn't really help anyone which I

01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:08.000
thought was an interesting little dig it helps me I can't imagine I mean EA

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:12.480
fucked off and did their origin store because they just want to be elitist and

01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:16.600
only sell things through their own platform but if a game developer is

01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:24.000
letting steam sell a five-year-old game for $2.99 I don't think valve is

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:28.680
twisting their arm zithers in our chat room talking about the Sega stuff saying

01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:32.520
I hope to God we get Phantasy Star online to hear if that gets canned I

01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:37.800
will explode I hear ya that character creator came out this week overseas it's

01:40:37.800 --> 01:40:41.560
not you know that the game has been announced for the US cross your fingers

01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:43.960
and your toes we get any three announcement because if you don't hear

01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:48.800
it at e3 it's probably not happening you know what is happening though a sieve

01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:54.040
5 expansion civilization 5 gods and kings it is going to be coming out on

01:40:54.040 --> 01:41:01.160
June 19 is the release date for that 22nd if you're international there was

01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:03.880
more information announced about this a game developers conference but in case

01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:09.960
you forgot 27 new units 13 new buildings 9 new wonders and civilization they're

01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:13.840
also going to add religion and espionage into the game and some tweaks to

01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:18.000
diplomacy so hopefully they'll fix some of the balancing issues that they borked

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:22.600
in the game to begin with but if any of my sieve friends are listening we're

01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:25.960
gonna need to get a match going in late June after this comes out because I'm

01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:30.080
I'm eager to revisit the game again but God you know how the sieve 5 matches

01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:32.960
will go you started at six o'clock in the evening and then suddenly oh shit

01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:41.200
it's 2 a.m. and we just discovered railroads another story this week epic

01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:47.520
games you know epic games they make well you know epic games including unreal and

01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:52.080
you know the Gears of War here's the deal they have announced sort of that

01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:57.960
they're doing a PC exclusive project it was mentioned during a PAX East panel

01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:02.880
the unannounced PC project is under development the plans are to keep the

01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:08.280
game exclusive to the PC so if you were worried that epic was all about the

01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:11.800
consoles and I don't know iOS games now because that's the other big thing they

01:42:11.800 --> 01:42:17.920
did right infinity blade don't worry a PC exclusive title is in the works hmm

01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:27.160
could be interesting Alan there has been an online petition for the game Dark

01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:31.960
Souls the sequel to Demon's Souls otherwise known as one of the hardest

01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:39.520
console games ever this generation the petitions been to bring it on to the PC

01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:46.400
platform and Atlas has come out and said yes there will be a PC edition of Dark

01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:52.960
Souls and it's called the Dark Souls prepare to die edition to which anyone

01:42:52.960 --> 01:42:58.960
that's played the game would say very much yes you will die there was a lot of

01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:03.360
hype in last few weeks about the game journey I believe it is that sort of has

01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:08.320
an online element if that's correct Demon's Souls was similar in that when

01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:11.960
you were fighting in these labyrinths you would fight these ghouls that were

01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:17.000
actually other players and Demon's Souls has a similar mechanic or sorry Dark

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:22.520
Souls has a similar mechanic so yeah it's a very difficult game and it's

01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:25.760
coming to PC it's one of the few examples of where an online petition was

01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:33.600
a success it has over 92,000 signatures and it has exclusive bosses to the PC

01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:41.260
Edition which I'm sure will be just as impossibly hard or even more so so Dark

01:43:41.260 --> 01:43:48.400
Souls fans on PC you're in luck Skyrim 1.5 patch which I was surprised when I

01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:52.120
read this story because I've been playing on PC Skyrim 1.5 patch for a

01:43:52.120 --> 01:44:00.440
couple weeks now is hitting 360 and ps3 this week and it's mostly bug fixes at

01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:06.800
least two dozen or so bug fixes that were blocking progress on certain quests

01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:12.760
the big deal though about patch 1.5 Skyrim is that it's it's adding kill

01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:19.280
moves and kill cinematic like awesome slow-mo bullet cam for projectile

01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:23.240
weapons like arrows and spells which Skyrim didn't have before and also new

01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:27.640
kill moves for melee weapons so now not only can you behead people you can fry

01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:31.480
them you can shoot arrows through their necks and all that other stuff you saw

01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:36.160
in shaky cam Hunger Games yes they fixed what it looks like when you go underwater

01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:42.640
and it also looks like they finally fixed the Lydia bug Lydia is the first

01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:47.640
guard woman that you get and you when you buy a house she if you're wearing an

01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:51.600
omelet amulet of Mara you should be able to propose to her she's been bugged this

01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:58.820
whole time since November or whatever so finally they fixed the Lydia bug yes I

01:44:58.820 --> 01:45:05.920
look for that on Xbox and ps3 this week finally Sonic 4 episode 2 the big 2d

01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:12.600
HD resurgence of the sonic franchise that kind of came off like a fart in an

01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:18.840
elevator is getting its episode 2 like everyone's like it sounds so awesome and

01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:24.760
then it came out and it's no one Kerr it is finally getting its episode 2 and it

01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:29.240
will likely be the last episode so they are wrapping this up really fast

01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:33.560
episodic content is the way of the future like we'll give you a part 2

01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:36.760
because no one like this shit and we don't want to make it anymore so thanks

01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:44.920
Gabe Newell PSN version will be released on a May 15th XBL a version of Sonic 4

01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:50.840
episode 2 will be the next day May 16th and PC and mobile versions are I guess

01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:57.040
confirmed but to be announced later all right that's all let's go to the

01:45:57.040 --> 01:46:02.440
frugal question of the week oh no we won't go to the frugal question of the

01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:07.480
week well one quick thing I missed in the theater them story if you're at PAX

01:46:07.480 --> 01:46:12.960
East you can go check out the oh sorry nevermind it's over yeah it was joke may

01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:23.760
I do the frugal now absolutely every week we ask you guys a question over at

01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:27.520
Facebook or Google Plus Facebook put together that's Google that's our concern

01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:30.880
facebook.com slash orange lounge radio if you want to like us over there and

01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:36.040
Google Plus slash search for orange lounge radio because we don't get short

01:46:36.040 --> 01:46:39.880
URLs there I'll start with Google Plus tonight because the very first answer on

01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:42.880
Google Plus I need to read this because it has something very important in it oh

01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:48.160
I should tell you guys what the question was just like I forgot to tell you what

01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:51.040
the question was just then I forgot to give a good question earlier in the week

01:46:51.040 --> 01:46:55.760
so I made it really easy this week I said how was your gaming week shit we

01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:58.680
all have to say every night how our gaming weeks were the host of the show

01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:01.320
so why shouldn't the listeners get a shot so how was your gaming week

01:47:01.320 --> 01:47:05.580
listeners I especially said what game are you into right now that everybody

01:47:05.580 --> 01:47:09.600
else should be playing so Derek H starts us off on Google Plus and this is worth

01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:13.880
mentioning he's playing pinball arcade on Xbox Live arcade but everyone should

01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:19.520
be playing joust on maim as part of the hunt and I totally forgot to mention

01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:24.600
this I'm so bad and I had like notes to myself to mention this partly because I

01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:28.560
had no idea this was happening until Monday of last week after last week

01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:32.440
show but dark Tetsuya who pretty much writes most of the articles in orange

01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:36.320
launch radio.com at this point it's either him or act after me me

01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:39.920
publishing episodes of the show and that's it at this point dark Tetsuya is

01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:44.880
doing a little contest and it's called the hunt and it's based off of the book

01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:47.920
ready player one where they kind of do something very similar I don't want to

01:47:47.920 --> 01:47:52.440
go into all the details but he's doing kind of his own spin of the competition

01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:56.120
called the hunt and it involves classic video games and being able to get

01:47:56.120 --> 01:48:00.720
scores that are better than what dark Tetsuya gets and he doesn't really try

01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:04.520
super hard because he makes it you know beatable so right now the contest he's

01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:08.640
running is joust and if you can beat a score of 39,000 something so I mean

01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:13.120
39,800 you take a screen cap of it and either email it to dark Tetsuya or you

01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:17.000
post it on Twitter and you're gonna get a little copper key and some points that

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:21.800
let you into the next round of the competition so joust is the game that

01:48:21.800 --> 01:48:25.960
they're doing right now I don't know how much longer you have to do it I'm hoping

01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:30.120
dark Tetsuya will allow a little bit of an extension because if you weren't

01:48:30.120 --> 01:48:33.440
reading the website you may have missed or seen the Twitter you may have missed

01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:38.320
this so I'm telling you guys now if you have joust be it in MAME or Xbox Live or

01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:42.840
whatever fire it up get the score and go on to the next round of the competition

01:48:42.840 --> 01:48:47.400
because as I understand it right now Derek H is in the lead and well we just

01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:52.160
we can't we we have to give us a competition you guys Derek H is the guy

01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:56.480
behind like the big battle and all that stuff so we have to we have to give him

01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:59.840
a challenge here we don't let him just walk away with everything so I submitted

01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:05.680
my entry today and I'm gonna try to play in future weeks as well so more

01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:09.840
information is available on orange lounge radio calm now Derek H also wants

01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:15.220
to plug you will die on Xbox Live indie games because I get money when people

01:49:15.220 --> 01:49:20.080
buy it well played well I see what you did there actually you will die is a fun

01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:23.040
game though like if you like you know your retro shooters he did a good job I

01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:27.480
did buy it I bought it like two years ago when it first came out so he's

01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:33.920
probably long spent the money but I did buy it all right uh pwk responded and

01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:38.680
said I was at my first packs this weekend congratulations I hope you had

01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:43.080
fun I want to hear more about it Tony M responded and said this is an oldie but

01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:47.000
after Atlas recently cut the prices of their PSN downloads I've been playing

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:51.800
persona 3 portable it's pretty awesome if you're into JRPGs you know persona is

01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:55.080
one of the series I hear nothing but good things about but I just I personally

01:49:55.080 --> 01:49:59.200
haven't sat down and played it myself but like I said the same thing about

01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:03.240
Mass Effect a few months ago on the show I haven't really played it myself but I

01:50:03.240 --> 01:50:06.280
hear a lot of people are really into it so persona one of these days I'm gonna

01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:10.720
sit down and play it maybe that's something you could do after Mass Effect

01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:14.080
play persona is that a serious interest you at all no you did play it before

01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:19.000
though didn't I have you don't know three and four for ps2 I think might

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:24.600
still be shrink-wrapped on this show all right let's go to Facebook read some of

01:50:24.600 --> 01:50:28.480
the answers there um lots of replies on Facebook I can't possibly read these all

01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:32.960
but I do want to thank you guys for taking the time to actually answer these

01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:37.720
let's see another persona Austin W says right now I'm really into persona 4 on

01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:41.760
PlayStation 2 anyone who is a fan of JRPGs dungeon crawlers and the social

01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:48.120
character interaction aspect of games should check it out let's see going to

01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:53.960
Stan says splitting my time between draw something angry bird space push mo on

01:50:53.960 --> 01:51:00.760
3ds and more Soulcalibur 5 online trying to show off my creative souls Chad C

01:51:00.760 --> 01:51:05.880
responds and says been playing realm of the mad god it's an MMORPG shooter with

01:51:05.880 --> 01:51:12.240
85 player groups what free to play on your browser also on steam 35 make

01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:18.240
download 8-bit graphics perma death kind of sucks when your guy you log 30 plus

01:51:18.240 --> 01:51:22.320
hours on dies but it's so easy to get into that it won't stop you from playing

01:51:22.320 --> 01:51:26.960
more what perma death and an MMO that's crazy once you hit level 20 you start

01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:31.040
gaming gaining fame which allows you to buy keys to unlock more dungeons the

01:51:31.040 --> 01:51:34.320
final boss is onyx everyone gets teleported to his lair when all quests

01:51:34.320 --> 01:51:38.960
are completed on your realm and someone kills 2500 mobs the game isn't over when

01:51:38.960 --> 01:51:42.160
he dies however because you can keep getting gaining fame to unlock harder

01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:46.840
dungeons and get better loots I don't know this game but it sounds crazy

01:51:46.840 --> 01:51:50.080
thank you I keep bumping into it but I haven't really taken the plunge myself

01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:54.040
huh now you knew there were gonna be some people talking about Xenoblade this

01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:58.280
week so we have Barry M Xenoblade Chronicles on the Wii is an amazing JRPG

01:51:58.280 --> 01:52:02.480
game much in the vein of Final Fantasy 12 meets my White Knight Chronicles I

01:52:02.480 --> 01:52:06.440
think that's exactly how I described it when I first reviewed it actually also

01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:10.280
playing Ragnarok Odyssey on Vita Kid Icarus uprising on 3ds and Tales of

01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:16.440
Graces F on PlayStation 3 this is a great year for RPG fans Carlos M says

01:52:16.440 --> 01:52:21.880
I'm halfway through Dragon Age 2 on my 360 and 56 coins and to draw something

01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:25.840
I'd like that those two games are like on the same level there it's awesome

01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:31.720
zether simply responds Xenoblade everyone probably knows why and dark

01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:35.720
soccer would kick me if I didn't say I randomly started playing Portal 2 again

01:52:35.720 --> 01:52:41.000
I know I know I should be playing Mass Effect yes you should I'm gonna read

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:45.440
this comment from unfolded Raptor it's a long one but it's good this past week

01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:48.880
the blockbuster video in the city I live in was going out of business and had a

01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:53.000
liquidation sale and had to sell everything so I found a whole bunch of

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:59.280
really good PlayStation 3 games for $8 each I ended up buying 15 that I never

01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:02.360
played yet and probably won't for a while I'm not gonna read all these but

01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:07.720
like Twisted Metal Demon Souls Deus Ex Bulletstorm there's a ton in here grand

01:53:07.720 --> 01:53:11.240
total of a hundred and seventy three dollars for those games it's a steal

01:53:11.240 --> 01:53:15.200
considering at Walmart and even at the evil G the lowest some of these get is

01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:19.320
around 20 bucks I highly suggest people play Borderlands that they haven't yet

01:53:19.320 --> 01:53:22.640
it's a ton of fun other than that I've been dedicating myself to Ninja Gaiden

01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:26.840
3 and have almost finished it I'm loving that as well and I don't see why all the

01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:31.040
hate for it sometimes I think that people forget how to have fun pretty

01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:34.000
similar situation in my neck of the woods and I'm sure many other places

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:38.760
people people around work were saying you what if there's any movie you've

01:53:38.760 --> 01:53:41.400
been wanting for a long time go check out the blockbuster right down the hill

01:53:41.400 --> 01:53:46.760
cuz uh it'll be gone soon I want a blockbuster to go out of business here

01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:51.120
California props it up a lot better than some of these more sparse well they all

01:53:51.120 --> 01:53:54.920
went under already years ago red box took over years ago here there's like

01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:59.400
only I can only think of like where one blockbuster even is there's one over on

01:53:59.400 --> 01:54:02.880
Folsom below are that I know I'll keep your eye on it for it to go under well

01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:08.200
okay I will do that it's right next door to Papa Murphy's so we it's like the

01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:12.680
only pizza chain I'll eat so anymore so all right there you go that was our

01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:16.200
frugal question of the week thank you guys for responding sorry I didn't read

01:54:16.200 --> 01:54:19.000
them all but like that was more that since it was such an easy question there

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:26.000
was more there than like ever before so let's move on Jason more news electronic

01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:31.440
arts has been voted the worst American company ever okay not ever but just in

01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:35.840
2012 so I guess it's actually for 2011 considering the year just started

01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:40.420
whatever beyond that the consumerist holds an annual tournament to determine

01:54:40.420 --> 01:54:44.160
the most despised American companies nominations are put to a vote and the

01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:48.120
ultimate winner is crowned the worst company of this of the year electronic

01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:55.240
arts congratulations in a poll that took over 250,000 votes EA beat out the Bank

01:54:55.240 --> 01:55:00.920
of America for its greed and treatment of consumers with a comfortable 64% lead

01:55:00.920 --> 01:55:07.640
hell hath no fury like a pack of scorned gamers I don't think EA has ever double

01:55:07.640 --> 01:55:11.480
withdrawn someone's mortgage payment and I know people can be evaded have had

01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:16.400
that happen so I'm a little skeptical I know the study has been going on for a

01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:22.480
while but with the timing to the Mass Effect 3 ending wank this seems I timed

01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:27.560
poorly for the story for me I ate all the popcorn I'd saved for this story

01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:33.080
because I have not seen such internet lulls like I've seen this week on this

01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:37.840
story from all facets I mean there's obviously the people that you know voted

01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:42.120
for this and allowed it to win that just their seething hatred for EA that mostly

01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:46.560
comes down to everything that happened in Mass Effect and you granted there's

01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:51.240
the DLC stuff there's I mean I'm not letting an EA off easy here but you know

01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:57.120
it's not like they're Capcom there's I think EA's kind of taken the burden for

01:55:57.120 --> 01:56:01.240
everything that everything hey everybody hates with the gaming industry right now

01:56:01.240 --> 01:56:05.080
I think it's kind of said in that statement but then what also cracks me

01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:10.480
up is like the people on the consumerist that are like fucking gamers fucking

01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:16.200
gamers ruining this poll fucking Bank of America is the fucking evilest company

01:56:16.200 --> 01:56:21.680
in the world what the fuck is wrong with gamers obviously gamers are too poor to

01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:27.720
own a house and it's like you guys internet polls are really fucking

01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:33.280
serious business everybody look at your lives look at your choices you are all

01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:42.000
rabble-rabble ing over an internet poll on some website that is owned by the

01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:45.240
same people that don't go talk to I think I know no they sold it off years

01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:48.600
ago but then one time you know what I'm saying it's just who cares it's an

01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:54.120
internet poll it is not that serious you know what your worst company is and who

01:56:54.120 --> 01:56:58.800
you're gonna give money to and not and so forth it's it's kind of an individual

01:56:58.800 --> 01:57:04.520
decision so and meanwhile Activision Blizzard is going to dodge that bullet

01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:10.320
girl we ain't done shit the rest of this article is a pretty good read I'll leave

01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:15.200
it verbatim to those who might sneer at something as non-essential as a video

01:57:15.200 --> 01:57:19.320
game company winning the worst company in American vote it's that exact kind of

01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:23.800
attitude that allows people to ignore the complaints as companies like EA to

01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:28.100
nickel-and-dime consumers to death argues the site for years while movies

01:57:28.100 --> 01:57:32.300
and music became more affordable and publishers piled on bonus content or

01:57:32.300 --> 01:57:37.240
multiple modes of delivery or multiple modes of delivery is added value to

01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:41.040
entice customers to buy video games have continued to be priced like premium

01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:44.920
goods for its exploitation of the downloadable content model the

01:57:44.920 --> 01:57:49.640
consumerist will be sending EA a little golden poo as a trophy the poo is

01:57:49.640 --> 01:57:53.180
usually presented on a red pillow but this year the company is sending a

01:57:53.180 --> 01:57:58.200
choice of colors mocking the controversial Mass Effect 3 ending haha

01:57:58.200 --> 01:58:03.600
like the Razzies sorry it's okay as gratuitous as EA's deals he is I can't

01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:08.560
help feeling that it's not quite as bad as illegal foreclosures of or some of

01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:13.080
the other scummy things the companies in the running did there you go though the

01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:19.440
internet hath spoken also hath was my addition it said has but there you go

01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:26.440
and I loved EA put out some response that was very like we don't give a fuck

01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:31.120
like it was very much like all this money on our naked bodies we don't care

01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:38.240
it's so amazing no it was very like well I guess Halliburton and Exxon and all of

01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:44.080
them are really happy that they didn't win the award this year and then pop cap

01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:49.000
put out a statement that was like you fucking design quality games for 30

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:53.000
years I'm paraphrasing clearly you fuck his healthy pop cap would put it that

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:56.160
way but it was basically you fucking design games for 30 years that are

01:58:56.160 --> 01:58:59.240
quality games and try to make the internet happy and see where it gets you

01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:05.840
but in my opinion that statement as much as I love pop cap I love them a lot but

01:59:05.840 --> 01:59:09.880
that statement they need to step away from the Borg hive mind that they're

01:59:09.880 --> 01:59:12.760
starting to become a part of because that's not the reason why EA won this

01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:17.160
award look at the reason that look at the trends that EA has been starting

01:59:17.160 --> 01:59:22.040
look at the things that people don't like EA invented the online pass EA you

01:59:22.040 --> 01:59:26.080
know obviously this whole Mass Effect thing they're taking some of the brunt

01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:32.120
on that EA sports games every year with no discernible difference is probably

01:59:32.120 --> 01:59:36.120
the exclusive contract is probably the driving force between behind trying to

01:59:36.120 --> 01:59:40.720
lock out used gamers in the next gaming cycle you know they want that to happen

01:59:40.720 --> 01:59:48.240
look at origin Oh God an origin yeah not wanting to play nice with other gaming

01:59:48.240 --> 01:59:52.520
companies they they refuse basically to play by the normal rules of Xbox Live

01:59:52.520 --> 01:59:55.960
and we're like either we get to build our own infrastructure or we're not

01:59:55.960 --> 01:59:59.640
putting our games out on your system and the kind of using that muscle Mass Effect

01:59:59.640 --> 02:00:06.840
3 isn't on Steam and you know that would sell there exactly so anyway enjoy your

02:00:06.840 --> 02:00:12.440
golden poo yeah internet polls are very serious business clearly now there's an

02:00:12.440 --> 02:00:16.080
interesting follow-up to the all this stuff it isn't directly a follow-up to

02:00:16.080 --> 02:00:20.440
the same same story but there's always going to be that guy that asks what

02:00:20.440 --> 02:00:26.120
about all the good things EA did and to be fair EA had a couple big stories this

02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:30.400
week that were some good news so let's cover them one of them which I think all

02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:35.480
of you have got to be aware of by now but it is out there they have announced

02:00:35.480 --> 02:00:43.280
that there will be Mass Effect 3 extended cut Mass Effect 3 DLC extended

02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:47.640
cut is coming out it's going to be coming out this summer it is going to be

02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:52.920
providing a more fleshed out experience for their fans it's going to bring

02:00:52.920 --> 02:00:58.080
closure to the ending is there nice PC way of saying we're gonna fix the

02:00:58.080 --> 02:01:01.980
goddamn ending then fine here's the big thing about it that I got a mid even

02:01:01.980 --> 02:01:07.240
caught me is my surprise it's gonna be free it's gonna be free through April of

02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:12.120
2014 or something like that and even then they said they buy aware said they

02:01:12.120 --> 02:01:17.340
only end dated it because EA has a policy on free DLC has to be end dated

02:01:17.340 --> 02:01:21.440
and they won't ever charge for it if they can get away with it and it's free

02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:25.800
because it is not an addition of playable content or missions it is

02:01:25.800 --> 02:01:31.140
literally you restore a save before the final encounter before all of the

02:01:31.140 --> 02:01:37.000
expositor expository narrative ending cinematic crap and that visually that

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:42.660
you watch is expanded upon so it's free because it's not it's it's additional

02:01:42.660 --> 02:01:47.920
content but it's not playable some rumors going around that the voice

02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:53.640
actors for femshep and male Shep have not been asked to come back yet which

02:01:53.640 --> 02:01:58.500
implies that you know and again I got a I got a tread lightly around the ending

02:01:58.500 --> 02:02:04.640
here but if they're not in it then how could they really do much of an ending

02:02:04.640 --> 02:02:09.120
that perhaps it's just gonna be text on the screen all a text I think that's a

02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:12.440
little bit silly there could be some type of like third-person narration or

02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:16.980
something going on I could see that happening but or maybe it's gonna be

02:02:16.980 --> 02:02:20.220
told from somebody else's point of view like years later or something I don't

02:02:20.220 --> 02:02:23.780
know I think there's still a lot they could do with it that even though they

02:02:23.780 --> 02:02:27.400
don't have the voice actors back but it sounds like again the Internet's already

02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:32.120
not happy with it well it's it's not a new ending which is what people are

02:02:32.120 --> 02:02:35.740
demanding they're like throw this shit that you put in the game out give us

02:02:35.740 --> 02:02:39.720
something completely different but they wear that there I was like no this is

02:02:39.720 --> 02:02:44.560
our artistic you know point of view so it's not a different ending and it's not

02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:48.120
any new ending choices they are just fleshing out what's already there yeah

02:02:48.120 --> 02:02:52.240
trying to explain it more or what have you so in a way it's kind of like saying

02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:58.240
well it's very metaphorical and up to your imagination and you didn't get it

02:02:58.240 --> 02:03:03.000
so if you didn't get it then here's we're gonna throw you a bone so what do

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:07.760
you think about the fact that the internet got their way well they didn't

02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:11.920
they didn't I mean they're getting something else I'm actually I'm legit

02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:15.180
surprised they're doing it for free and I said a few weeks ago on the show I

02:03:15.180 --> 02:03:18.840
said if they don't put it out for free then they're just assholes and to my

02:03:18.840 --> 02:03:21.920
surprise they're doing it for free so I have to stand by what I said and that is

02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:26.480
that it's hard to complain about this I feel that they only really did this

02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:31.240
because their analysts or whatever saw evidence of an actual fist fiscal impact

02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:34.960
with the fact that Amazon was accepting Mass Effect 3 returns as a defective

02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:40.040
product I know that's really cynical and pessimistic it's nice that they're

02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:44.480
throwing the Phantom of fandom a bone but you know if EA has the final say

02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:49.580
this is just damage control to say that they they attempted something even if

02:03:49.580 --> 02:03:55.340
fandom still hates it and I think that their hands were forced because they

02:03:55.340 --> 02:03:58.960
could possibly lose money off of the degree of butthurt that the Phantom was

02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:07.640
showing so as far as the fact that them them getting getting their way but they

02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:10.940
kind of didn't get their way they didn't they didn't I mean it's gonna be really

02:04:10.940 --> 02:04:13.600
hard to say until it comes out but I just I think there's gonna be a lot of

02:04:13.600 --> 02:04:18.960
people that still aren't happy with it imagine if the internet it was what it

02:04:18.960 --> 02:04:26.960
is today with Final Fantasy 7 right oh no game will ever be as hyped up or as

02:04:26.960 --> 02:04:33.160
anticipated as Final Fantasy 7 was but we kind of just had to eat shit and deal

02:04:33.160 --> 02:04:36.560
with it was kind of a jank ending we didn't really have the outlet or

02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:43.280
resources to freak out on a company like this but what happened to you fee who

02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:49.120
feet visit what do you mean what happened they weren't even there exactly all right

02:04:49.120 --> 02:04:52.840
I think a lot of people probably already made up their mind on this DLC though

02:04:52.840 --> 02:04:58.920
did you have anything to say Jason I'm just effect so I I will probably get

02:04:58.920 --> 02:05:03.000
around to the series eventually but yeah not yet completely missed it well here's

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:07.680
something that impacts Mass Effect and it's and some other Bioware games it's

02:05:07.680 --> 02:05:11.640
something Bioware is kind of known for and Bioware obviously tells these very

02:05:11.640 --> 02:05:16.920
deep stories and sometimes romance is an option in these stories and Bioware has

02:05:16.920 --> 02:05:22.680
been in many ways a pioneer for any type of relationship you want meaning if you

02:05:22.680 --> 02:05:24.920
want to be in a straight relationship or if you want to be in a gay relationship

02:05:24.920 --> 02:05:31.640
and they're starting to get some pushback for that and EA is EA who owns

02:05:31.640 --> 02:05:35.840
Bioware is kind of the target of all this there is an anti gay letter writing

02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:40.360
campaign going on right now EA's received several thousand letters

02:05:40.360 --> 02:05:46.400
objecting to same-sex relationships in their games the letters are being sent

02:05:46.400 --> 02:05:51.200
to a variety of senior leaders at EA threatening to boycott EA games until it

02:05:51.200 --> 02:05:56.920
changes its policy EA is standing by it say standing by their games saying they

02:05:56.920 --> 02:06:01.920
will continue to include LGBT characters in their games as options every one of

02:06:01.920 --> 02:06:06.160
EA's games includes ESRB content descriptors so it's hard to believe

02:06:06.160 --> 02:06:09.840
anyone is surprised by the content this isn't about protecting children it's

02:06:09.840 --> 02:06:14.840
about political harassment that's from EA's chief spokesperson Jeff Brown

02:06:14.840 --> 02:06:21.760
obviously Mass Effect 3 allows you to do man woman man man woman woman woman

02:06:21.760 --> 02:06:27.960
alien shit you can do whatever you want in Mass Effect and Mass Effect 1 was

02:06:27.960 --> 02:06:32.960
originally going to have same gendered pairings but with Dragon Age Origins

02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:36.320
coming out on the horizon which had a more involved relationship system they

02:06:36.320 --> 02:06:40.760
cut that content out and let Dragon Age Origins set that precedent mm-hmm and

02:06:40.760 --> 02:06:45.720
Mass Effect 1 sorry to interrupt took a lot of heat from conservative funding

02:06:45.720 --> 02:06:50.920
groups for having sex at all and many people having a sexual machine which

02:06:50.920 --> 02:06:54.320
isn't like it's not that much more than you'd see on an episode of like nip tuck

02:06:54.320 --> 02:06:59.840
or something I mean for real anyhow Star Wars the Old Republic is going to be

02:06:59.840 --> 02:07:03.640
having same-sex relationships it's been reported and some people are not happy

02:07:03.640 --> 02:07:08.560
with that because they don't they only see it as Star Wars like oh that movie I

02:07:08.560 --> 02:07:13.800
loved in 1978 it's gonna get the homos we can't have that

02:07:13.800 --> 02:07:19.440
later ain't no homo of course it almost had incest slightly so although that is

02:07:19.440 --> 02:07:25.720
completely right although that is completely incest is a okay but heaven

02:07:25.720 --> 02:07:31.600
forbid Vader be a homo which isn't even how it works Star Wars the Old Republic

02:07:31.600 --> 02:07:36.200
takes place thousands of years before the movies and all that it's completely

02:07:36.200 --> 02:07:38.840
different and saying it should be noted same-sex relationships aren't in the

02:07:38.840 --> 02:07:45.920
game yet it's been noted for a future patch it will be in the game the letters

02:07:45.920 --> 02:07:51.920
are coming from Florida the where the Florida Family Association is at and

02:07:51.920 --> 02:07:57.320
again EA is standing by it but I mean they're doing these it's clearly a form

02:07:57.320 --> 02:08:00.920
letter and if you look at the form letters like people will hand write

02:08:00.920 --> 02:08:04.320
messages on them that say like remembers like look at this one there's a

02:08:04.320 --> 02:08:08.640
handwritten message here you'll get a kick out of this thank you remember

02:08:08.640 --> 02:08:13.760
Sodom and then it's signed I had a friend who turned into salt last week so

02:08:13.760 --> 02:08:20.200
that shit is real and you will not minimize that that still happens can I

02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:25.920
read can I read the hate mail here dear mr. Riccitello it was troubling to learn

02:08:25.920 --> 02:08:30.560
that Bioware and Electronic Arts were pressured into committing to add

02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:38.000
LGBT content to Star Wars video games pressured by who they always announced

02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:44.000
it was going to be there I am also concerned that Bioware employees state

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:48.960
in postings at SWTOR.com that they have been censoring deleting and banning

02:08:48.960 --> 02:08:53.600
forum members for expressing opposing views about including homosexual content

02:08:53.600 --> 02:08:59.560
in the games children play guess what on a person's private forum the First

02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:05.600
Amendment does not exist for example if you're a guest in my home and you start

02:09:05.600 --> 02:09:08.960
talking like you know imagine if we invite somebody over let's say Jason's

02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:13.260
our guest and we invite Jason over in our house and Jason says you know I

02:09:13.260 --> 02:09:18.120
really hate faggots and I don't know how you and Alan can be faggots together

02:09:18.120 --> 02:09:23.040
what's gonna happen we're gonna throw him out right we're gonna we're gonna

02:09:23.040 --> 02:09:25.840
ban him right we're gonna kick him out of our house and he's not allowed to

02:09:25.840 --> 02:09:29.200
come here anymore obviously he wouldn't do that but I'm just he's sitting right

02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:32.800
there and he's an example this is the same analogy here if you come into

02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:35.680
somebody's house and say something they don't like they have every right to

02:09:35.680 --> 02:09:41.740
remove you you don't get a First Amendment yeah the overwhelming number

02:09:41.740 --> 02:09:45.880
of players on Star Wars games is children who do not need to be forced as

02:09:45.880 --> 02:09:50.000
a captured audience to participate in homosexual content thirty-year-old

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:54.280
children living in their parents basement whoa whoa whoa again if you're

02:09:54.280 --> 02:09:58.040
letting your child play an MMO unsupervised they're not getting that

02:09:58.040 --> 02:10:04.600
$14.99 a month themselves someone's credit card uh-huh we ask that you

02:10:04.600 --> 02:10:08.840
please adhere to your long-term policy of omitting and steering clear of this

02:10:08.840 --> 02:10:16.640
type of advocacy representation in your games what EA had a policy no please do

02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:20.760
not include LGBT content in Star Wars video games that will impact so many

02:10:20.760 --> 02:10:27.600
children thank you remember Sodom there it I mean the facts are just being

02:10:27.600 --> 02:10:33.440
distorted terribly I mean that this is here's the thing about this though is

02:10:33.440 --> 02:10:38.160
that you know these people don't fucking play video games because video games all

02:10:38.160 --> 02:10:44.240
together are the goddamn devil yep so there's no there's no real boycott

02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:49.160
happening here this is all for show it's all for press it's all for show it's

02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:54.160
just like those idiots that get out there at the funerals that say God hates

02:10:54.160 --> 02:10:58.920
fags and you're burning in hell because America embraces fat mr. Rogers is

02:10:58.920 --> 02:11:04.160
burning in hell because you know America's a fag-loving country and all

02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:07.080
this I hate that I'm using that word so much tonight but unfortunately I see it

02:11:07.080 --> 02:11:12.960
in these you know protests and things like that and it's just they do it what

02:11:12.960 --> 02:11:19.080
for attention for those that remember I know this isn't all that similar but

02:11:19.080 --> 02:11:23.920
when nipplegate happened with Janet Jackson at the Super Bowl the FCC came

02:11:23.920 --> 02:11:27.040
out and said that for all the thousands of complaints that they got it was some

02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:32.660
random group that was made up of 20 icky old creepy old white dudes that just had

02:11:32.660 --> 02:11:36.640
a form letter and they spammed the shit out of the FCC so the the fact that

02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:41.400
they're getting as many complaints isn't really representative of how the public

02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:45.640
feels because these these are just really isolated groups telling that

02:11:45.640 --> 02:11:49.800
they're following to send this form letter dozens of times and that adds up

02:11:49.800 --> 02:11:55.360
that makes it's just people making a fuss because they have nothing better to

02:11:55.360 --> 02:11:59.960
do with their lives they this is what they choose to do instead of going out

02:11:59.960 --> 02:12:05.240
into their community and choosing to do some good because what Alan and I have

02:12:05.240 --> 02:12:10.480
is so threatening there is no gay agenda because we're either at the bar or the

02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:18.160
gym we don't have time stop you Amy stop it anyway so it's even I love that they

02:12:18.160 --> 02:12:22.280
scan this in its signed I can't read that name is that homa Johnson home no

02:12:22.280 --> 02:12:39.760
homa Jay Lorne homa Jay Lorne dear homa Jay Lorne shut the fuck up anyhow prop

02:12:39.760 --> 02:12:45.160
CEA at least for standing by this whole thing because you know what I gotta say

02:12:45.160 --> 02:12:49.920
this even though I haven't played Mass Effect 3 myself yet I spoiled myself and

02:12:49.920 --> 02:12:53.120
looked at some of the stuff on YouTube I've looked at all the different romance

02:12:53.120 --> 02:12:57.520
scenes I've looked at the female female I've looked at the male female I've

02:12:57.520 --> 02:13:01.160
looked at the male-male relationships and I got to tell you the male-male

02:13:01.160 --> 02:13:05.480
relationship that they do one of the one in particular they do in the game is so

02:13:05.480 --> 02:13:12.280
well done it's it's kind of refreshing to see that it's a relationship that's

02:13:12.280 --> 02:13:17.960
not about the bar or the gym or any of that stuff it's it's really touching and

02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:25.400
they do it so well and so tastefully like I just can't believe people are so

02:13:25.400 --> 02:13:29.860
offended by it they want to take it out of the game stupid if this is what

02:13:29.860 --> 02:13:38.240
earned EA a big golden poo hold it up high right let's move on I'm all huffy

02:13:38.240 --> 02:13:42.960
now after that story well let's do the mailbag let's follow that up with some

02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:47.280
listener emails you know what the people I like to hear from let's do some

02:13:47.280 --> 02:13:58.040
listener emails every week you guys send us emails you mailbag at orange lounge

02:13:58.040 --> 02:14:01.680
radio.com and dark soccer opens up the email bag and read some of her favorites

02:14:01.680 --> 02:14:09.120
but she's not here tonight we took a poo in the bag and detrimental to ourselves

02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:13.360
isn't it here all right no there are there are some good emails tonight and

02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:18.520
Alan's gonna read them tonight will writes us and asks can't remember if

02:14:18.520 --> 02:14:22.440
this has been brought up on olr yet or not but have any of you checked out the

02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:28.480
web series titled cron tendo it's one dude playing every single Famicom slash

02:14:28.480 --> 02:14:35.000
nest game release in chronological order oh my god he plays them enough to give a

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:39.420
basic review and some history of the title needless to say it's a massive

02:14:39.420 --> 02:14:42.840
undertaking and worth checking out he has a YouTube channel but much more

02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:49.520
content is posted on the archive org site he also started a cron Sega series

02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:54.360
which is going through all of the master system titles in order the humor is

02:14:54.360 --> 02:14:58.800
pretty dry but fun to watch anyone wanting to know more retro gaming history

02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:04.920
or looking for some old games to play will want to give it a look man some

02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:12.000
people have a lot of time I think it's great it's a great endeavor though I saw

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:16.880
similar linked me to it might have been dark Sakura actually a group of let's

02:15:16.880 --> 02:15:21.660
play people on YouTube there's four of them they did a simultaneous battle

02:15:21.660 --> 02:15:25.920
toads the original that game is hard as hell it's it's on YouTube but it's quad

02:15:25.920 --> 02:15:30.480
screen just a competition to see who could get reach the end of the game the

02:15:30.480 --> 02:15:34.200
fastest and it's filled with swears because that game is hard now is very

02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:38.240
fun so look up about battle toads competition for that second email is

02:15:38.240 --> 02:15:43.840
from Stan who writes hi olr I have a question for you and anyone listening or

02:15:43.840 --> 02:15:48.640
this could be a future fool question what video game franchise would you like

02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:53.760
to see reimagined or translated into another genre for example the morrows

02:15:53.760 --> 02:16:00.720
the Mario for example the Mario series was fantastic as an RPG yes my answer

02:16:00.720 --> 02:16:04.840
would be seen the Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy characters be introduced

02:16:04.840 --> 02:16:09.960
in a Soul Calibur game so like Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy well there was

02:16:09.960 --> 02:16:15.640
our guys you want to kind of stretch it a little bit I also think it'd be funny

02:16:15.640 --> 02:16:22.400
to see Grand Theft Auto reimagined as a Japanese dating sim game now that's just

02:16:22.400 --> 02:16:29.800
silly signed Stan sent from his iPhone and he's very upset about the Instagram

02:16:29.800 --> 02:16:34.840
news this week no um gosh that's that's a tough one what would I like to see

02:16:34.840 --> 02:16:42.320
cross genres and persona 4 is getting a fighting game and I saw that email from

02:16:42.320 --> 02:16:48.240
Alice and I was like what how about an 8-bit version of demon souls like the

02:16:48.240 --> 02:16:53.520
platforming game where it dials up on a modem it's just basic online no it's

02:16:53.520 --> 02:17:00.880
just asshole Mario is all you guys have heard of the the the portal mod for the

02:17:00.880 --> 02:17:05.320
original Mario one haven't you oh yeah the Mario with the stylized oh yeah have

02:17:05.320 --> 02:17:08.960
you heard what the latest update is gonna be I think I heard something about

02:17:08.960 --> 02:17:14.480
soundtrack six player co-op now that sounds fun yeah not exactly cross genre

02:17:14.480 --> 02:17:19.440
unless you want to say it's portal being ported to 8-bit sidescroller that that

02:17:19.440 --> 02:17:25.840
yeah that question is really insanely difficult yeah my mind is just stuck in

02:17:25.840 --> 02:17:30.160
the fact that Super Mario RPG was freaking gorgeous and that was like the

02:17:30.160 --> 02:17:34.120
first RPG that ever really meant something to me and I actually I think

02:17:34.120 --> 02:17:38.680
it might be my very first RPG I ever actually beat Superstar Saga was not

02:17:38.680 --> 02:17:43.000
half-bad partners in time I didn't get far enough into but was still pretty fun

02:17:43.000 --> 02:17:50.000
I mean a Disney RPG Kingdom Hearts was grand I don't I don't know that there's

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:53.680
one specific series that would mean something to me in a different genre

02:17:53.680 --> 02:17:57.760
though that I could really pick yeah this is a hard one especially because I

02:17:57.760 --> 02:18:00.320
didn't really think about it beforehand like I'm trying to look through my game

02:18:00.320 --> 02:18:03.000
collection right now and see if anything jumps out of my eye is like something

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:08.260
I'd want different Alan did anything come to mind for you at all I'm still

02:18:08.260 --> 02:18:11.600

02:18:28.360 --> 02:18:35.800
Pokemon game but it's hose gotta catch them all I catch them all and it's so

02:18:53.180 --> 02:18:58.800
talking about Mario franchises Call of Duty Oh a first for our head shot

02:18:58.800 --> 02:19:07.040
against Princess Peach how about Mass Effect as a more fantasy RPG like with

02:19:07.040 --> 02:19:10.080
hit points and shit instead of the whole like first person although I gotta say I

02:19:10.080 --> 02:19:15.480
do I don't know shows Shepard arrives on this hit L and pulls out a gun blade not

02:19:15.480 --> 02:19:19.880
that crazy but I don't know that I gotta admit I'm not much of a first-person

02:19:19.880 --> 02:19:23.320
shooter type person but the map the combat Mass Effect is pretty darn good I

02:19:23.320 --> 02:19:26.400
guess I really wouldn't change it I did hear though they were doing that legit

02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:29.160
first-person shooter out of Mass Effect and that would've been kind of fun to

02:19:29.160 --> 02:19:34.240
play I think yeah us to move the music game as an RPG kind of dance summit

02:19:34.240 --> 02:19:40.360
style yeah cuz you got kitty Ann and then you know she could cast spells

02:19:40.360 --> 02:19:46.040

I'll start tonight fu to that people that are sending those letters to EA

02:20:38.480 --> 02:20:42.480
there's so many reasons to hate EA but that's not one of them that's one of the

02:20:42.480 --> 02:20:47.280
reasons to appreciate what they're doing so F you to all of them F you to sheep

02:20:47.280 --> 02:20:52.880
F you to people that are sheep because that's who those type of people are are

02:20:52.880 --> 02:21:01.000
sheep so think for yourselves F you to sheep Alan I guess F you to the fact

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:04.720
that I had a job interview two weeks ago and I didn't get it you know shit happens

02:21:04.720 --> 02:21:10.800
it's good to have an interview but also while I was trekking home from that

02:21:10.800 --> 02:21:15.000
interview for the job I didn't get I was completely done up in a suit dress shoes

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:20.720
you know interview attire rolled my ankle on uneven pavement and completely

02:21:20.720 --> 02:21:25.920
ate shit on the sidewalk hilarious I'm sure should be on YouTube if anyone had

02:21:25.920 --> 02:21:29.400
a camera going out so yeah F you to I guess not getting a job and being a

02:21:29.400 --> 02:21:35.520
klutz in the middle public F you did not having a job and needing a new pair of

02:21:35.520 --> 02:21:38.720
pants now yeah nobody to buy it throw the pants out because the road roush was

02:21:38.720 --> 02:21:44.080
so bad it ripped all in it do you have anything Jason F you to myself for

02:21:44.080 --> 02:21:49.800
forgetting how to get out of a door of a car I have this really nasty gash on the

02:21:49.800 --> 02:21:53.960
right side of my head because I apparently when I grabbed my bag in turn

02:21:53.960 --> 02:21:57.160
to get out of the backseat of a car I leaned forward and just completely

02:21:57.160 --> 02:22:01.240
knocked the corner of the door it hurt a whole hell of a lot and it looks pretty

02:22:01.240 --> 02:22:06.320
nasty and it feels kind of nasty but anti F you to immune systems and the

02:22:06.320 --> 02:22:10.880
ability to recover from that and I think there was another thing something about

02:22:10.880 --> 02:22:15.800
keys and doors and where I'm staying while I'm out here but I think I think

02:22:15.800 --> 02:22:19.000
the injury made me forget it so I guess I don't have it right now if anyone asks

02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:23.600
story though if anyone asks someone tried to mug you and you beat the shit

02:22:23.600 --> 02:22:28.360
out of them and that's the little mark or tell him it's a sex injury let him

02:22:28.360 --> 02:22:31.520
try to figure it out I think I was coming up with some kind of I I tried to

02:22:31.520 --> 02:22:35.400

02:23:21.800 --> 02:23:27.040
ago Capcom decided to make a very similar game by the name of Max explosion

02:23:27.040 --> 02:23:31.300
that came out on iOS and there was a little a little a little kerfuffle

02:23:31.300 --> 02:23:35.520
between the two studios Capcom and twisted pixel twisted pixel says well

02:23:35.520 --> 02:23:40.180
you know Capcom made Megaman so I guess it's not all that bad and drama ceased

02:23:40.180 --> 02:23:44.920

02:24:10.520 --> 02:24:14.140
about this game that I'm about to talk about and it's kind of sad when you get

02:24:14.140 --> 02:24:18.560
more excited about the portable version of a game then the console version of a

02:24:18.560 --> 02:24:23.840
game but you I have legit reason for this guy's epic Mickey of course is

02:24:23.840 --> 02:24:27.340
getting epic Mickey 2 on the consoles which you know is all fine and dandy

02:24:27.340 --> 02:24:33.400
whatever still we right we Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 okay so good for them

02:24:33.400 --> 02:24:41.480
stepping it up but on the 3ds Disney epic Mickey power of illusion oh yes

02:24:41.480 --> 02:24:47.240
it's what it sounds like it's a basic I don't want to say a sequel to but

02:24:47.240 --> 02:24:54.920
heavily inspired by castle of illusion oh my god that game was gorgeous for its

02:24:54.920 --> 02:25:00.320
day and a really amazing platformer oh my god and now it's gonna be on the 3ds

02:25:00.320 --> 02:25:05.840
and it's going to incorporate yet you get to draw objects that magically

02:25:05.840 --> 02:25:09.960
transform into Disney style 2d illustrations and then they're gonna be

02:25:09.960 --> 02:25:15.240
3d on the 3ds is top screen blah blah blah but it gets its influence from a

02:25:15.240 --> 02:25:20.080
lot of modern-day Disney movies like Tangled is gonna have a level and yeah

02:25:20.080 --> 02:25:24.880
I'm so excited about this Beauty and the Beast from the screenshots here you can

02:25:24.880 --> 02:25:31.440
see I mean it's just got that right mix of like retro look to it no Tron no sale

02:25:31.440 --> 02:25:36.120
you never know you never know Peter Pan Tron is in that Kingdom Hearts game

02:25:36.120 --> 02:25:43.320
coming out dreamed up distance so it just looks gorgeous I'm so excited like

02:25:43.320 --> 02:25:47.260
I could care less now about the console one just bring me that 3ds game you guys

02:25:47.260 --> 02:25:53.840
is a 3ds game I'm excited about yeah it's not just a port a 3d port of a

02:25:53.840 --> 02:25:57.720
client of a good classic game like Zelda Rama in the chat room put it best I

02:25:57.720 --> 02:26:02.560
can't say it any better myself shut up and take my money

02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:11.200
amen Allen so this story is a doozy wow I'm not sure how to report this I guess

02:26:11.200 --> 02:26:15.640
I wanted you to do this for a reason I guess the state of Arizona just looked

02:26:15.640 --> 02:26:19.760
at Florida is the worst state of in the country and was like no we have to do

02:26:19.760 --> 02:26:24.760
better and and for the last seven or eight years they have been okay so this

02:26:24.760 --> 02:26:30.720
story is about a bill that has passed the both sides of the state legislature

02:26:30.720 --> 02:26:36.520
so it's ready to be signed by the governor and it's the anti trolling

02:26:36.520 --> 02:26:41.280
cyberbullying bill is it just me or does the governor of Arizona kind of reminds

02:26:41.280 --> 02:26:47.280
you a Cruella de Vil like I'm not sure he's the one who put her finger in the

02:26:47.280 --> 02:26:50.960
face of Obama yeah yeah just like don't doesn't she remind you of Cruella de

02:26:50.960 --> 02:26:54.120
Vil a little bit like I'm not trying to get political or whatever and I'm not

02:26:54.120 --> 02:27:00.780
it's it's just she's kind of nasty anyway sorry didn't mean to derail you

02:27:00.780 --> 02:27:04.160
yeah so it passed both houses it's waiting for the governor to sign it a

02:27:04.160 --> 02:27:11.720
governor Brewer and basically if let me read exactly what the the statute

02:27:11.720 --> 02:27:18.880
dictates it is unlawful for any person with intent to terrify intimidate

02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:26.680
threaten harass annoy or offend to use any electronic or digital device digital

02:27:26.680 --> 02:27:31.560
device and use any obscene lewd or profane language or suggest any lewd or

02:27:31.560 --> 02:27:36.920
lascivious act or threaten to inflict personal harm to the person or property

02:27:36.920 --> 02:27:42.480
of any person so you cannot be shitty to people on the internet if the recipient

02:27:42.480 --> 02:27:47.420
is in Arizona because if they try to prosecute you it could be a class one I

02:27:47.420 --> 02:27:54.040
think misdemeanor which I want to say the maximum fine for that is $2,500 and

02:27:54.040 --> 02:27:58.020
up to six months in jail is that the right direction that the receiver has to

02:27:58.020 --> 02:28:02.280
be in Arizona I kind of figured it would have been the cinder the origin oh that

02:28:02.280 --> 02:28:09.080
that is actually addressed here let me find it sorry yeah come arrest me

02:28:09.080 --> 02:28:15.320
Arizona sucks what are you gonna do about it there are already exceptions to

02:28:15.320 --> 02:28:19.040
the First Amendment which is freedom of speech which is which is obscene and

02:28:19.040 --> 02:28:24.480
obscenity is very vague and also inciting violence site like saying this

02:28:24.480 --> 02:28:27.960
person should get beat up let's all meet at the place in time that's inciting

02:28:27.960 --> 02:28:32.040
violence but just being an asshole on the internet you know think of the penny

02:28:32.040 --> 02:28:37.800
arcade greater internet theory have you ever read the comments to a story on

02:28:37.800 --> 02:28:47.620
yahoo news oh my god they would fill the jails in Arizona overnight I'm fucking

02:28:47.620 --> 02:28:52.000
serious go read the comments to any story on yahoo news story any of them or

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:56.360
the answers on yahoo answers it could be a story about like fluffy kitties and

02:28:56.360 --> 02:29:00.960
dogs and it'll be like that dog is fucking ugly and it looks like an Obama

02:29:00.960 --> 02:29:05.760
dog because Obama's ugly and all like this this is what oh my god I gotta go

02:29:05.760 --> 02:29:10.000
to yahoo news right now and give you an idea what I mean here a whole new level

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:15.360
of quality for the show huh this is important because yes and this is this

02:29:15.360 --> 02:29:20.440
is how it ties into the gaming world because of course what did gamers love

02:29:20.440 --> 02:29:26.360
to do more than anything troll be shitty to each other with no consequences which

02:29:26.360 --> 02:29:30.760
I guess this bill is trying to fix and if this bill does get signed it's like

02:29:30.760 --> 02:29:36.040
many bills that California itself has had where it's effective as law for like

02:29:36.040 --> 02:29:39.040
a minute and then it immediately gets shoved into the courts and it's

02:29:39.040 --> 02:29:42.960
unenforceable and it gets juggled around in the courts to decide if it's

02:29:42.960 --> 02:29:47.280
constitutional not for years and eventually goes away so already you know

02:29:47.280 --> 02:29:49.780
people are saying that this is way too vague and there's no way this is

02:29:49.780 --> 02:29:54.280
enforceable and blah blah blah and call me a grammar Nazi unless that's illegal

02:29:54.280 --> 02:30:00.040
in this state but the text of the the text of this bill is it's one of those

02:30:00.040 --> 02:30:04.160
things like for some reason there have been these weird weird quirk grammar

02:30:04.160 --> 02:30:10.120
stories in the news lately notably talking about the the talking about a

02:30:10.120 --> 02:30:14.720
the new iPad because they only referred to it during the keynote as the new

02:30:14.720 --> 02:30:20.880
iPad so if anybody says I want the iPad 3 no you want a the new iPad but you you

02:30:20.880 --> 02:30:24.560
read you read the text of the particular statute and what jumped out to me

02:30:24.560 --> 02:30:29.280
immediately was it is unlawful for any for any person with intent intimidate

02:30:29.280 --> 02:30:36.180
blah blah blah to use a any electronic or digital device it is unlawful for any

02:30:36.180 --> 02:30:43.080
person to use a any electric or digital device is one little letter I don't I

02:30:43.080 --> 02:30:47.160
don't mean to like narrow in on this but it's just kind of like the language

02:30:47.160 --> 02:30:50.360
already sucks but to throw something in there that just doesn't make any damn

02:30:50.360 --> 02:30:56.400
sense come on guys so if I write something rude on the side of a toaster

02:30:56.400 --> 02:31:02.560
incentive trolling here's I just fucking arrest you in Arizona because you're

02:31:02.560 --> 02:31:07.480
trolling you are now a wanted criminal in Arizona since the bill stipulates

02:31:07.480 --> 02:31:12.600
that the offense only has to occur on Arizona soil that basically puts the

02:31:12.600 --> 02:31:19.400
entire internet on notice according to this article so if the infraction

02:31:19.400 --> 02:31:25.080
allegedly is it is viewable within Arizona which of course Facebook last I

02:31:25.080 --> 02:31:29.840
check doesn't filter themselves out of Arizona maybe they should now that'll

02:31:29.840 --> 02:31:34.200
make the people in Arizona really happy Google already block YouTube in Arizona

02:31:34.200 --> 02:31:38.680
yet yeah that'll probably be in next week's stories we out so if the

02:31:38.680 --> 02:31:44.820
infraction is you can view it from an Arizona network then you I guess

02:31:44.820 --> 02:31:48.720
according to this bill have the right to try and prosecute the narrow mindedness

02:31:48.720 --> 02:31:55.360
of something that in their dream little world could affect to the whole freaking

02:31:55.360 --> 02:32:03.960
world another addition to this is that if the trolling is contributing proof

02:32:03.960 --> 02:32:09.040
if you're able to prove that it's attributing to actual stalking of a

02:32:09.040 --> 02:32:13.020
person then that would bring it up to a class 3 felony and there's a whole

02:32:13.020 --> 02:32:18.480
additional cache of stalking laws that would then be brought into this I guess

02:32:18.480 --> 02:32:24.400
it's supposed to be a countermeasure to cyberbullying which I do believe kids

02:32:24.400 --> 02:32:28.320
have killed kids have killed themselves because of hate pages made like this

02:32:28.320 --> 02:32:33.400
page that someone is you know a fat slut on Facebook that's shitty and parents

02:32:33.400 --> 02:32:37.440
and teachers should get involved so cyberbullying sucks but an anti trolling

02:32:37.440 --> 02:32:42.640
bill is not the way to go about it at least not the way it's written so some

02:32:42.640 --> 02:32:46.640
sections of Yahoo News have apparently switched to requiring Facebook logins

02:32:46.640 --> 02:32:51.560
which I guess a lot but here let me give you an example here's a story on

02:32:51.560 --> 02:32:58.360
President Obama wishes Jews Christians happy Passover Easter so what's the harm

02:32:58.360 --> 02:33:01.560
in the president wishing people a happy holiday for whatever it is they believe

02:33:01.560 --> 02:33:06.920
it right nothing wrong with that right let's see

02:33:06.920 --> 02:33:13.280
Jack Haynes says Obama stop lying we know you're a secret Muslim Bob Harvey

02:33:13.280 --> 02:33:18.960
says Muslim use a fabric Bob Harvey says I'd vote for Reagan's corpse before I

02:33:18.960 --> 02:33:24.000
vote for this egotistical clueless inept narcissist there actually is a story

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:28.680
about a dead politician beating an alive one Jack Van Valen says did he get the

02:33:28.680 --> 02:33:36.840
okay from the Muslim Brotherhood like and the thing if you if you are

02:33:36.840 --> 02:33:43.960

02:33:48.920 --> 02:33:53.880
line at that asshole but I mean he is the president scroll up what's the

02:33:53.880 --> 02:34:00.080
headline again Obama wishes President Obama wishes Jews Christians happy

02:34:00.080 --> 02:34:05.000
Passover Easter the White House Christmas card from this most recent

02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:08.600
December was I think their cat or their dog I don't remember what fucking pet

02:34:08.600 --> 02:34:13.760
they have it just said happy holidays that's it no Merry Christmas or Hanukkah

02:34:13.760 --> 02:34:17.160
or anything happy holidays with no Christmas tree and no nativity and the

02:34:17.160 --> 02:34:22.400
Christians flipped their shit now he's wishing Christians and Jews a Passover

02:34:22.400 --> 02:34:32.320
some Christian sorry flip their shit yes so it's yeah can't win for losing any

02:34:32.320 --> 02:34:38.560

02:34:38.560 --> 02:34:42.840
all just get along holidays of advertising past all right now only if

02:34:42.840 --> 02:34:51.920
you're in Arizona all right look less politics more gaming stories Jason help

02:34:51.920 --> 02:34:58.600
with well I guess it's not exactly politics but cute childish I owe cute

02:34:58.600 --> 02:35:04.760
iOS app childhoods end back online after pedo bear mix-up Apple was worried it

02:35:04.760 --> 02:35:09.160
might be a recruiting tool for pedophiles essentially what this boils

02:35:09.160 --> 02:35:12.960
down to is that there was a tower defense game called childhoods end which

02:35:12.960 --> 02:35:21.760
featured large bears converging on the point where you would die in a tower

02:35:21.760 --> 02:35:26.480
defense scenario and the developer submitted an update and the one

02:35:26.480 --> 02:35:31.840
particular Apple the one particular App Store reviewer got a hold of it and said

02:35:31.840 --> 02:35:37.840
why is pedal bear advancing on a childhood game and they they sent the

02:35:37.840 --> 02:35:41.840
developer a notice that they will need to take extended time they will be they

02:35:41.840 --> 02:35:45.480
will need additional time for an extended review and immediately followed

02:35:45.480 --> 02:35:49.000
that up with direct contact with the developer and expressing their concern

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:52.460
and caution over the subject matter I've never heard of this app before and I

02:35:52.460 --> 02:35:57.760
looked at a I looked at a lot of stuff about it but perhaps one of the things

02:35:57.760 --> 02:36:01.960
that doesn't exactly help why were you so interested in a pedo bear app I'm

02:36:01.960 --> 02:36:09.000
just researching the story the description of the app says use your

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:13.800
wits and tactics to guide big Phil along his quest in this engrossing defense

02:36:13.800 --> 02:36:19.320
game with towers join big Phil now and help him navigate his adolescence as he

02:36:19.320 --> 02:36:23.760
fights off the evil teddy bears of his childhood your tactical skills and with

02:36:23.760 --> 02:36:27.560
a little bit of luck is all big Phil needs to see him through his teenage

02:36:27.560 --> 02:36:33.960
years not exactly the childish that you would expect but you know you know

02:36:33.960 --> 02:36:39.360
what's in a name there's a couple things coming out about the this article I

02:36:39.360 --> 02:36:43.080
haven't exactly understood what exactly this is but they put a there's a

02:36:43.080 --> 02:36:49.680
screenshot of the in-game bears versus a picture of pedo bear and saying of

02:36:49.680 --> 02:36:53.160
course the image is broken now so I can't recite it off but it's it's it's

02:36:53.160 --> 02:36:57.160
drawing a contrast that this is a teddy bear you will see it in almost any

02:36:57.160 --> 02:37:02.280
American child's home that has stuffed animals why is this a big deal I mean we

02:37:02.280 --> 02:37:06.120
know why it's a big deal but this particular version just makes no sense

02:37:06.120 --> 02:37:11.600
the the game was subtly changed the art for the bear was changed a little bit

02:37:11.600 --> 02:37:18.720
at the update resubmitted and I believe it's been approved at this point now

02:37:18.720 --> 02:37:25.360
Peter bear free yeah if one of those things said it's a silly situation for

02:37:25.360 --> 02:37:31.200
something that probably didn't need to happen but it did so man you know one

02:37:31.200 --> 02:37:35.000
more news story for you guys before we get to the calls and as if this show

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:41.480
couldn't go any further down the toilet I think this news story is kind of like

02:37:41.480 --> 02:37:46.040
it's trolling that somehow is traveling across the game blogosphere because this

02:37:46.040 --> 02:37:51.040
guy can't be fucking serious I'll go governor Brewer well the arrest this

02:37:51.040 --> 02:37:57.640
man it is who did this it was Camille german pres I'm sorry if I butchered

02:37:57.640 --> 02:38:03.680
that name but Camille german pres talked about studio are kato's they made the

02:38:03.680 --> 02:38:07.960
game hell yeah for Sega it's one of their first games to come out they're

02:38:07.960 --> 02:38:10.400

02:38:51.480 --> 02:38:56.640
the bar we already had news stories about the the urinal games where they

02:38:56.640 --> 02:39:02.440
were installing games on the urinals for men to play or you know women if they

PAX East this is your third PAX East where does this rank because I was

02:41:47.960 --> 02:41:53.160
reading some negative negativities on Twitter the negativities are probably

02:41:53.160 --> 02:41:55.720
coming from the people that were complaining about the fact it was the

02:41:55.720 --> 02:42:00.040
same weekend as anime Boston hey look people if you gone to more than five to

02:42:00.040 --> 02:42:03.240
six anime conventions in a year it wouldn't kill you to go to a gaming

02:42:03.240 --> 02:42:07.280
convention which was a hell of a lot better just just please shower while

02:42:07.280 --> 02:42:10.380

this one there was a lot of showering there was very little confunk laughing

02:42:18.920 --> 02:42:23.700

02:42:43.520 --> 02:42:48.120
were they showing we didn't hear a lot of news news come out of PAX East no no

02:42:48.120 --> 02:42:52.720
it was just from like there's a lot of independent developers especially from

02:42:52.720 --> 02:42:57.880
the Boston area I mean there was a big all this big Microsoft display really

02:42:57.880 --> 02:43:03.220
then really pushing the Kinect games over in the corner was Nintendo over the

02:43:03.220 --> 02:43:07.660
same place they were last year pimping out the 3ds with one new game spirit

02:43:07.660 --> 02:43:14.040
camera it was a nice mention of MMOs you had League of Legends all the way towards

02:43:14.040 --> 02:43:19.560
the back of the expo hall but packed all the damn time there were people

02:43:19.560 --> 02:43:26.320
wandering around checking out lotro and D&D online and one other thing that

02:43:26.320 --> 02:43:29.640
packs does a lot of too is that they just have like it's not just about the

02:43:29.640 --> 02:43:33.080
new games or whatever this on the show floor but there's like like people

02:43:33.080 --> 02:43:39.360
sitting in the hallways playing card games and people playing D&D in rooms

02:43:39.360 --> 02:43:44.760
and people playing Magic the Gathering and classic games and you I mean how

02:43:44.760 --> 02:43:50.720
many freaking games did you see people playing too many I mean there was like

02:43:50.720 --> 02:43:56.640
Catan I mean there was one booth I think I forget the name of it but you could

02:43:56.640 --> 02:44:02.600
pick up a game and play like borrow and just learn to play it I remember early

02:44:02.600 --> 02:44:06.920

Cards Against Humanity good times oh yes yes indeed um did you go to any of the

02:44:21.680 --> 02:44:24.560

them packs a lot of announcements come out of the panels I went to one panel

02:44:28.960 --> 02:44:32.680
the whole weekend it was the nerdcore hip-hop panel which is something I look

02:44:32.680 --> 02:44:36.760
forward to every year nice how was that it was great it was a little bit

02:44:36.760 --> 02:44:42.720
different from last year's where it was front a lot mega Rana came Murdoch they

02:44:42.720 --> 02:44:48.480
pretty much discussed the history of hip-hop nerdcore how it came together

02:44:48.480 --> 02:44:55.040
last year mega had discussed more about how he got into it his backstory this

02:44:55.040 --> 02:44:58.920

02:45:09.600 --> 02:45:13.960
on I think was storm runner I think that was the first one I caught a part of

02:45:13.960 --> 02:45:19.800
Metroid metal and this was my first time listening to them and I was like wow the

02:45:19.800 --> 02:45:26.440
best way I can describe Metroid metal is this take Metallica India prime at plus

02:45:26.440 --> 02:45:30.960
one I love Metroid metal we've played some of their stuff on the show it's

02:45:30.960 --> 02:45:35.200

I can't wait for Metroid scream oh oh Rob here's a quick story that you'll

02:45:59.800 --> 02:46:06.200
greatly appreciate hmm as we were as me and Jovian walking into the eye this is

02:46:06.200 --> 02:46:12.480
a convention center I had said to her that I saw somebody with a x-plate a pin

02:46:12.480 --> 02:46:15.720
on their back I'm like I threw mine in the garbage he's like why I'm like

02:46:15.720 --> 02:46:21.040
because I don't support you for the person at least six feet in front of me

02:46:21.040 --> 02:46:26.640
over her he's like yeah I can't stand them either next you know it is about 20

02:46:26.640 --> 02:46:31.680
to 30 people going into convention to complain about how much g4 sucks well

02:46:31.680 --> 02:46:38.000
done Boston well done yes yes indeed all right so before I let you go what else

02:46:40.520 --> 02:46:45.960
did check out a couple of games um Final Fantasy theater rhythm it's a fun game

02:46:45.960 --> 02:46:52.560
Oh only Square Enix can take a music rhythm game and make it into an RPG 40

02:46:52.560 --> 02:46:58.680
bucks worth is it worth it yeah I said that's definitely a day one purchase

02:46:58.680 --> 02:47:05.040
hmm interesting okay all right I also checked out Sonic the Hedgehog for

02:47:05.040 --> 02:47:11.720
episode 2 and is it as shitty as the first one I love the graphics the

02:47:11.720 --> 02:47:20.880
controlling not so much I'd wait but I but this was something funny because we

02:47:20.880 --> 02:47:28.600
were talking to one of the people at the booth sorry I had a cry for Sonic talk

02:47:28.600 --> 02:47:32.800
to one the guys at the booth and you say it's only going to be on 360 and ps3

02:47:32.800 --> 02:47:37.760

comment from Jeremy appreciate that especially so we're not doing the show

02:50:29.560 --> 02:50:34.520
at your house anymore but you has a birthday coming up yes I do so when we

02:50:34.520 --> 02:50:37.080
come back in two weeks cuz we're not gonna be here next week we come back in

02:50:37.080 --> 02:50:40.120
two weeks it'll be like your birthday show weekend so what are we gonna do

02:50:40.120 --> 02:50:46.200
for your birthday cake and pinkberry that sounds doable I think we could do

02:50:46.200 --> 02:50:55.320
that yeah because well I mean I'm doing a something this Friday but I you know

02:50:55.320 --> 02:50:58.880
me when I have my birthday I like to let the party go you know for a couple weeks

02:50:58.880 --> 02:51:03.960
exactly make it last you only get one a year so make it last for a month exactly

02:51:03.960 --> 02:51:11.000
and you remember the the the beer and pay and cake potluck I do well I'm

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:16.260
thinking about having a pie party I'm thinking about it pie is awesome so I

02:51:16.260 --> 02:51:19.960
think you should definitely look into doing that yes or either that or just

02:51:19.960 --> 02:51:24.480
Dave & Buster's and I drink until I bar for something I don't know I hope you

02:51:24.480 --> 02:51:27.440
feel better in time for that to come around I hope this doesn't like stick

02:51:27.440 --> 02:51:33.600
around for a week no it's all allergies I on Thursday I played over I was over

02:51:33.600 --> 02:51:39.360
at Becky's house playing with her son in the backyard that was very grassy very

02:51:39.360 --> 02:51:44.840
allergic to grass and I started stuffing up like right after that and Friday I

02:51:44.840 --> 02:51:49.680
was just sniffy got a sniffy over and then started hacking so that's why I

02:51:49.680 --> 02:51:58.720
have no voice better huh I hope you feel better thank you I am all right and I

02:51:58.720 --> 02:52:03.000
hope you're not too mad I changed the classic game of the week no bitch all

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:07.880
right I kind of expected it cuz honestly I you know I would have been

02:52:07.880 --> 02:52:11.880
disappointed if I didn't get to do the one I wanted exactly so we'll hear that

02:52:11.880 --> 02:52:15.240
in two weeks when we come back with OLR anything else you want to let the

02:52:15.240 --> 02:52:19.320
listeners know before we let you go pass out from Robitussin I'm not gonna pass

02:52:19.320 --> 02:52:23.200
out from Robitussin not for another hour anyway all right then before I hang up

02:52:23.200 --> 02:52:34.720
on you um no bye bye bye bye dar Sakura thanks for calling it's always good to

02:52:34.720 --> 02:52:39.120
hear you know check in say hello the phone's ringing off the hook tonight hi

02:52:39.120 --> 02:52:43.680
you're on orange on radio who's this so Shane hi Shane what's up I'm playing

02:52:43.680 --> 02:52:47.240
World of Warcraft that's what's up did you go to PAX East this weekend I

02:52:47.240 --> 02:52:53.880
totally didn't so why are you calling I don't know why are you calling you you

02:52:53.880 --> 02:52:57.280
called us what do you want what's on what's on your mind um I wanted to

02:52:57.280 --> 02:53:01.520
respond to the EA getting the worst company of the year thing or whatever

02:53:01.520 --> 02:53:06.520
uh-huh I totally after reading EA statement that they put out I felt

02:53:06.520 --> 02:53:12.160
really bad for them and I kind of feel like the internet won and lost because

02:53:12.160 --> 02:53:17.920
they were just way too loud and they should not have you know beaten Bank of

02:53:17.920 --> 02:53:22.080
America of all people you do realize in their statement they need like they said

02:53:22.080 --> 02:53:26.640
well at least it wasn't Halliburton or did it and yeah they named like three of

02:53:26.640 --> 02:53:31.320
the prior winners of the contest I didn't know their prior winners but

02:53:31.320 --> 02:53:35.760
still I don't I don't think they should have even come close to winning I think

02:53:35.760 --> 02:53:39.440
there were a lot of other companies up there that I saw and they're like half a

02:53:39.440 --> 02:53:44.200
picture I would see on Kotaku when I'd sadly go to their site like I think I

02:53:44.200 --> 02:53:48.240
saw a Best Buy up there which they deserve to be up there I think I saw I

02:53:48.240 --> 02:53:52.680
think I saw AT&T which deserved to be up there here's the thing though here's the

02:53:52.680 --> 02:53:57.560
thing does it really matter it's just the internet it's a poll on the internet

02:53:57.560 --> 02:54:01.680
no honestly I guess it's publicity and you know the whole saying about

02:54:01.680 --> 02:54:07.740
publicity and stuff and it's never bad blah blah blah well right after we

02:54:07.740 --> 02:54:10.740
reported on that we turned around and talked about a couple good things that

02:54:10.740 --> 02:54:14.120
EA is doing and I'm sure you have opinions on these so first yes the Mass

02:54:14.120 --> 02:54:20.480
Effect 3 ending um I'm torn I appreciate what they're doing it's still not what I

02:54:20.480 --> 02:54:25.380
would like but one of the writers clarified some things this week on

02:54:25.380 --> 02:54:31.200
Twitter and it sounds like a lot of the doom and gloom that people inferred from

02:54:31.200 --> 02:54:36.640
the endings were because the writers thought we were smarter than that but

02:54:36.640 --> 02:54:40.520
you know that's a stupid thing to think when you're basing it off of things

02:54:40.520 --> 02:54:43.360
you've seen in the game for the past however many years the series has been

02:54:43.360 --> 02:54:51.040
going so I'm excited to see the extended cut I know it's not going to satisfy me

02:54:51.040 --> 02:54:55.360
though because it's not what I exactly want which you know that's an impossible

02:54:55.360 --> 02:55:03.600
request anyway I kind of I mean can they do anything to make you happy though um

02:55:03.600 --> 02:55:09.320
yes what they could do is make a Mass Effect 4 with all my same characters and

02:55:09.320 --> 02:55:15.200
just make a new story and keep it going cuz I am not done with Shepard or any of

02:55:15.200 --> 02:55:21.000
my crew members even the ones that may or may not have died in 3 and so you're

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:26.240
trying to sleep with and continuing your relationship with yes especially Caden

02:55:26.240 --> 02:55:32.320
and you want a more explicit Mass Effect 4 no no but better romance scenes would

02:55:32.320 --> 02:55:38.280
be nice because it's it's like you know maybe a ten-year-old came up with them

02:55:38.280 --> 02:55:43.120
and they didn't have any concept of what a relationship is besides like kissing

02:55:43.120 --> 02:55:48.040
and holding hands and maybe like hitting the other person every so often well

02:55:48.040 --> 02:55:51.360
wait a minute though okay let's get into the other story which is about the whole

02:55:51.360 --> 02:55:55.280
target of the EA is a target of the anti-gay campaign so you've you've

02:55:55.280 --> 02:55:59.120
obviously romanced Kaidan with your with your man Shep so your benefits yeah

02:55:59.120 --> 02:56:06.320
you're benefiting from the content that they've put in the game a do you think

02:56:06.320 --> 02:56:11.280
this campaign means anything no it's just something for that stupid

02:56:11.280 --> 02:56:17.240
organization to do this week cuz they pick something new every week and B well

02:56:17.240 --> 02:56:22.880
you kind of like showed me these scenes that you know the the man-on-man with

02:56:22.880 --> 02:56:28.200
Kaidan and all that and how well done they were well they're well done well

02:56:28.200 --> 02:56:33.520
okay wait wait let me back up the romance scene is not well done once you

02:56:33.520 --> 02:56:38.560
get into the romance part but like the date scene and the conversations they

02:56:38.560 --> 02:56:44.400
have brilliant because I aware for the most part can write amazingly well but

02:56:44.400 --> 02:56:49.440
they need to learn a thing or two about romance scenes cuz Dragon Age that was

02:56:49.440 --> 02:56:53.540
laughable I didn't see Mass Effect 1 I didn't do anything in two because you

02:56:53.540 --> 02:56:58.440
know saving myself for Kaidan and in three it's like let me get pushed down

02:56:58.440 --> 02:57:02.360
on the bed and then we're gonna roll around for like half a second and oh

02:57:02.360 --> 02:57:05.680
we're under covers now and we're sleeping okay but it's not like they're

02:57:05.680 --> 02:57:14.060
gonna get porno on you you know but it was also more like can't spoil things it

02:57:14.060 --> 02:57:22.100
was like a shirtless scene of something that you do earlier in the game with

02:57:22.100 --> 02:57:29.360
another crew member that isn't romantic at all wrestling well there's like a

02:57:29.360 --> 02:57:34.340
like a little sparring match that's kind of what it reminded me of except we had

02:57:34.340 --> 02:57:41.660
no pants all right pants in the sparring match all right but but otherwise I

02:57:41.660 --> 02:57:45.880
mean it's certainly more interesting than what we've probably seen in any

02:57:45.880 --> 02:57:51.080
other video game wouldn't you say probably more interesting you know the

02:57:51.080 --> 02:57:54.320
male male or female female stuff we've seen in other games which has been

02:57:54.320 --> 02:58:00.400
remarkably little but I'm sure in other games there have been better male female

02:58:00.400 --> 02:58:06.680
romance scenes because I assume that the developers are probably straight and

02:58:06.680 --> 02:58:10.200
have more experience with that like they couldn't just load up like a porn

02:58:10.200 --> 02:58:14.200
website okay that is pretty blanket statement to make though I mean there's

02:58:14.200 --> 02:58:17.840
probably hundreds of people that work at Bioware I'm sure there's a couple people

02:58:17.840 --> 02:58:22.040
there that have some you know first-hand experience well I'm saying the ones that

02:58:22.040 --> 02:58:26.960
that designed the scene not that worked there period gotcha sure they're like

02:58:26.960 --> 02:58:31.280
three all right uh Shane I gotta let you go to get some more calls you have

02:58:31.280 --> 02:58:36.360
anything else you want to say mmm oh you should go download the rest of your

02:58:36.360 --> 02:58:39.840
download content for Mass Effect 2 because the shadow brokers what I did

02:58:39.840 --> 02:58:45.480
today that $10 one and it was amazing it was so so good right now except I spent

02:58:45.480 --> 02:58:49.680
all my points on that pinball arcade game well go buy more points one more

02:58:49.680 --> 02:58:54.960
problem solved holy crap I gotta let you go bye now bye bye all right one eight

seven seven game olr excuse me or username on skype is orange lounge radio

02:59:01.280 --> 02:59:05.480
acidic vampire in our chat room says the actual romance scene is kind of dorky in

02:59:05.480 --> 02:59:11.400
Mass Effect 3 but the after romance scene is quite touching bonds double o

02:59:11.400 --> 02:59:15.880
six says enchanted arms for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 that has tons of guy on

zenocore from the OKC how you guys doing hey how you doing zenocore see I knew

02:59:44.880 --> 02:59:47.320
you knew how to work your Skype it's had to be something like that all right

02:59:47.320 --> 02:59:52.220
what's on your mind buddy and not much of it I purchased Arkham City finally

02:59:52.220 --> 02:59:56.320
because I said screw it I'm not gonna get any DLC anyway and it's ruined

02:59:56.320 --> 02:59:59.920
gaming for me now I can't play half the other games because it's not as

02:59:59.920 --> 03:00:04.000
satisfying but I'm sitting knocked everything out of Barbara I can't play

03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:09.560
Skyrim now because the combat sucks I can't play dragon aids I can't play half

03:00:09.560 --> 03:00:13.000
the RPGs I got anymore because the combat just does nothing whatsoever

03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:16.880
Arkham City is just that fucking good like it raised the bar that high that

03:00:16.880 --> 03:00:20.780
now everything else sucks asylum is better than that I mean the only thing

03:00:20.780 --> 03:00:25.840
that holds a candle to it as far as a RPG like environment I'm not counting

03:00:25.840 --> 03:00:29.200
Mass Effect because it's a first-person shooter is mountain blade of all the

03:00:29.200 --> 03:00:33.400
things that's the guts they got the most visceral hand-to-hand combat that I know

03:00:33.400 --> 03:00:37.240
of in an RPG like setting and that's a conquest game so technically doesn't

03:00:37.240 --> 03:00:40.840
even count and it's very disappointing to me is it just the combat that you

03:00:40.840 --> 03:00:44.160
love about Arkham City or what is it about this game that makes it so great

03:00:44.160 --> 03:00:50.000
it well I guess just the way it goes you actually feel like you're really whooping

03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:53.800
ass I mean everybody knows this about Arkham City in Arkham Asylum anyway this

03:00:53.800 --> 03:00:58.160
isn't new news but the fact that nobody else has done this in any other game yet

03:00:58.160 --> 03:01:05.720
is freaking annoying to me I mean I finally upgraded my POS computer to

03:01:05.720 --> 03:01:09.280
something that's near top of the line I play Arkham City and I can't play half

03:01:09.280 --> 03:01:14.560
the other action action or RPG games on it because they all suck as far as that

03:01:14.560 --> 03:01:17.840
it's all I'm doing is clicking the mouse at least in Batman you're somewhat

03:01:17.840 --> 03:01:22.580
managing things and using multiple weapons all at once I mean you hell when

03:01:22.580 --> 03:01:25.640
they did added that stuff with Catwoman's like holy shit this is fun as

03:01:25.640 --> 03:01:30.040
hell just beating people to death little whip but it is it is really it's just

03:01:30.040 --> 03:01:34.720
it's funny to hear you say how much it's just ruined everything else because it's

03:01:34.720 --> 03:01:40.160
so good I know it man I never thought I'd be in this position so I just blew

03:01:40.160 --> 03:01:45.400
almost a thousand bucks on this machine and I've gone back to playing like Space

03:01:45.400 --> 03:01:49.040
Harrier 2 on the on the Sega emulator I got off of Steve and everything else

03:01:49.040 --> 03:01:53.440
just because nothing after I start after about 10-15 minutes I got to put it down

03:01:53.440 --> 03:01:59.460
because it's not as good as Arkham City or I look oh my god so what about the

03:01:59.460 --> 03:02:07.280
rumors of Arkham world I'm not paying attention to those we'll see but that

03:02:07.280 --> 03:02:11.580
combat engine is unique it's not gonna work in anything that's that large

03:02:11.580 --> 03:02:16.620
because it's tied to together like the combat from like a way back when from

03:02:16.620 --> 03:02:20.800
the game Oh knee when that first came out of ps2 that combat system was

03:02:20.800 --> 03:02:23.760
amazing but the way they built it you couldn't do anything else with it there

03:02:23.760 --> 03:02:27.280
is no multiplayer ready thing because the way they glued it together so I

03:02:27.280 --> 03:02:32.320
think Arkham City and Arkham asylum that style of gameplay is gonna be stuck in

03:02:32.320 --> 03:02:38.280
that have you checked out any of the DLC yet I'm not going to Robin Nightwing

03:02:38.280 --> 03:02:44.520
whatever all I need is a big bad cat woman and I'm good that's interesting I

03:02:44.520 --> 03:02:47.000
don't know why but I find that very interesting that even though you love

03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:50.640
the game so much you're like man don't really need to do the DLC cuz like for

03:02:50.640 --> 03:02:54.880
me like I I probably will have to play all that Mass Effect DLC at some point

03:02:54.880 --> 03:03:02.600
just because I'm getting so into this you know Mass Effect DLC Jesus man what

03:03:02.600 --> 03:03:07.480
a what a racket that was have you played the Mass Effect DLC and no because my

03:03:07.480 --> 03:03:13.000
roomy he bought the game run it released and he was gonna ruin it for me so after

03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:17.720
seeing what actually were rewards you get it's like beating Rygar but not

03:03:17.720 --> 03:03:21.960
doing it in an old-school way the old-school Rygar ending was something

03:03:21.960 --> 03:03:25.640
you got because you fucking earned it everybody can get to the ending in this

03:03:25.640 --> 03:03:29.720
game and it's gonna be a piece of shit so why bother oh my god pay for it

03:03:29.720 --> 03:03:32.920
that's a classic 8-bit game I really need to try and do start to finish like

03:03:32.920 --> 03:03:37.440
your event yeah my car was two screens and one of them has some animation on

03:03:37.440 --> 03:03:41.000
that's it but that game was so freaking hard you're glad to see that screen

03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:45.680
because you do not not many people get to see it but seriously yes but uh and

03:03:45.680 --> 03:03:48.720
then they're just gonna slap a patch top of Mass Effect 3 to explain the

03:03:48.720 --> 03:03:53.000
explaining the ending apparently so they're not gonna actually make it to

03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:56.400
where you actually steer the character in one of three directions without

03:03:56.400 --> 03:04:00.560
making a single choice at the end which ruins the whole experience for me so

03:04:00.560 --> 03:04:05.400
now they're not getting any my money for that series anyway all right any last

03:04:05.400 --> 03:04:08.600
thoughts before we let you go tonight Xenocore yeah the dark Sakura let that

03:04:08.600 --> 03:04:12.720
tussin soak in there girl remember put some water in it shake it up more

03:04:12.720 --> 03:04:16.280
tussin tough it out all right now hopefully she's listening I hope she

03:04:16.280 --> 03:04:21.880
heard that all right take care buddy later all right bye

03:04:23.200 --> 03:04:28.640

03:04:52.200 --> 03:05:01.600
this yeah hey Zaku what's up yeah me and uh Adam your Ron was you after the

03:05:01.600 --> 03:05:06.960
column we all went to packs together hell we even room together nice how was

03:05:06.960 --> 03:05:14.120
it how'd you enjoy PAX East it was uh was it was almost a almost the same as

03:05:14.120 --> 03:05:19.560
um last year in terms of crowds like like Friday was just like the heaviest

03:05:19.560 --> 03:05:25.440
day like just trying to try my luck in in watching these trailers or playing

03:05:25.440 --> 03:05:30.840
some of these games there were like at least two two hours plus in line it

03:05:30.840 --> 03:05:35.640
wasn't even worth it what I did do was just hit up most of the panel though

03:05:35.640 --> 03:05:40.320
stuff like the harmonics panel on Saturday when they actually explained

03:05:40.320 --> 03:05:45.920
the whole process is to how rock band blitz became actually got it gone about

03:05:45.920 --> 03:05:51.920
like it actually started off as a prototype and you know within this was a

03:05:51.920 --> 03:05:56.820
prototype that was done within the course of a at least three years even

03:05:56.820 --> 03:06:01.680
though it didn't pick up full steam until that last summer so it basically

03:06:01.680 --> 03:06:07.200
went through several iterations where you know it for example the they

03:06:07.200 --> 03:06:11.680
actually they did a lot in terms of trying to figure out the proper controls

03:06:11.680 --> 03:06:18.000
seeing that they they propose so many so many ideas and solutions that most of

03:06:18.000 --> 03:06:21.480
them ended up failing until they found the one that worked which is basically

03:06:21.480 --> 03:06:28.200
either the joystick using the the D pads and the buttons or the shoulders just to

03:06:28.200 --> 03:06:33.040
just to hit both notes and then the whole notion of having whether or not to

03:06:33.040 --> 03:06:37.440
make it just like like frequency and amplitude in terms of a shifting you

03:06:37.440 --> 03:06:41.360
from one instrument to another automatically so it deviates from that

03:06:41.360 --> 03:06:47.440
in the sense that you can just play any you could stick with one completely like

03:06:47.440 --> 03:06:51.480
I tried it today and I was I was pretty much bouncing from one one track to the

03:06:51.480 --> 03:06:56.640
other within the song so you know coupled with the fact that you could

03:06:56.640 --> 03:07:01.160
just do mostly power-ups that you gain as you as you obviously hit more notes

03:07:01.160 --> 03:07:05.000
then it just basically it's almost like audio surf but in the sense that

03:07:05.000 --> 03:07:11.480
everything's structured more importantly everything is um it just said it's just

03:07:11.480 --> 03:07:16.040
binary in the sense wait did they have to have audio surf too on the floor no

03:07:16.040 --> 03:07:21.000
no no that wasn't there I'm pretty certain prime will probably that depends

03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:26.760
if they the developers of get get themselves a booth for prime but back to

03:07:26.760 --> 03:07:31.800
the point it's like like back in the days of amplitude it was pretty much the

03:07:31.800 --> 03:07:37.520
same way but it's the fact that the songs themselves of rock are like a rock

03:07:37.520 --> 03:07:41.680
nature where it's not like techno and this is one of the questions that was

03:07:41.680 --> 03:07:46.960
brought up in the panel I guess they're there the rationale was in the it's

03:07:46.960 --> 03:07:52.240
easier to just you know release a product in which on day one people who

03:07:52.240 --> 03:07:57.840
have existing rock band users and consumers could just you know start

03:07:57.840 --> 03:08:01.120
playing right away with their with their current with their current collection

03:08:01.120 --> 03:08:07.320
whereas if they added things that normally wouldn't fit into a into that

03:08:07.320 --> 03:08:12.800
rock band caliber like a techno trance on that was made you know that and made

03:08:12.800 --> 03:08:18.000
frequency and amplitude pretty much a you know called classic then it would

03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:22.360
just like folks have to start over from scratch let me let me try to get away

03:08:22.360 --> 03:08:25.360
from the rock band stuff for a minute we've seen so much about it on the

03:08:25.360 --> 03:08:29.200
internet what other panels did you get to all right the other all right other

03:08:29.200 --> 03:08:36.400
ones I like let me see the Kotaku panel that was on Friday where everyone

03:08:36.400 --> 03:08:41.280
everyone in that panel was taking it over for an hour so I just threw out one

03:08:41.280 --> 03:08:48.400
little question in terms of a sort of like an inside thing in Kotaku if you

03:08:48.400 --> 03:08:52.040
were like really in the in the site you would actually know like all their

03:08:52.040 --> 03:08:55.800
sections like how they how they have their own blocks of stories they let

03:08:55.800 --> 03:09:00.080
anyone have a panel they clearly are letting anyone have a panel so I want to

03:09:00.080 --> 03:09:05.360
know our panel at PAX Prime yeah but that was that folks writing stories

03:09:05.360 --> 03:09:09.920
within the hour and actually you know they actually they had a little work

03:09:09.920 --> 03:09:15.640
actually air their grievances in terms of banning people or or or actually

03:09:15.640 --> 03:09:20.360
taking pictures and so forth it was even live blogging that's productive open the

03:09:20.360 --> 03:09:24.880
floor back up to the people dance on a website yeah I mean did they suck their

03:09:24.880 --> 03:09:31.040
own dick in front of all you guys too no it's like they were just alright they

03:09:31.040 --> 03:09:35.200
what happened was like the the editors or actually the former editor of Kotaku

03:09:35.200 --> 03:09:40.360
was was spearheading the panel so the idea was that folks who just like pitch

03:09:40.360 --> 03:09:47.700
their their story ideas and the audience the the audience would actually pick the

03:09:47.700 --> 03:09:53.080
ones that that they would want to they would want to hear about and within that

03:09:53.080 --> 03:09:57.920
hour they would have to actually produce it you know write an article for it did

03:09:57.920 --> 03:10:03.800
they have a big on the site and did somebody judge people yeah the editors

03:10:03.800 --> 03:10:08.080
obviously the editing team was pretty much making sure everything was there

03:10:08.080 --> 03:10:12.400
all right no no disrespect but I could give two shits about the Kotaku panels

03:10:12.400 --> 03:10:17.000
tell me about our other one all right the other one was caught the tail end of

03:10:17.000 --> 03:10:24.600
the epic panel where cliffy be basically we're just going off on sir you know for

03:10:24.600 --> 03:10:29.520
questions in the audience one of which was a you know a girl actually trolled

03:10:29.520 --> 03:10:34.680
the whole panel is in saying that you know she wants to see Gears of War on

03:10:34.680 --> 03:10:39.880
PlayStation 3 and to which cliffy replied he will if they fix the you know

03:10:39.880 --> 03:10:46.520
they fix that god that weak rumble the ps3 controller and then she was promptly

03:10:46.520 --> 03:10:50.760
arrested in the state of Arizona for trolling the panel all right but the

03:10:50.760 --> 03:10:56.160
last one I caught was a was basically a classic arcade panel like you have no

03:10:56.160 --> 03:11:00.780
interest in penny art you know packs they have they have an actual classic

03:11:00.780 --> 03:11:06.560
arcade room like nothing but old arcade machines good I love that were the folks

03:11:06.560 --> 03:11:11.240
from the from a cam the American classic arcade museum actually they ran the

03:11:11.240 --> 03:11:15.520
panel with with a couple of developers who actually worked on the original like

03:11:15.520 --> 03:11:21.880
the original older arcade titles one of which was a food fight and miss pac-man

03:11:21.880 --> 03:11:27.640
and then the other the third one was he was a developer for a crew for the

03:11:27.640 --> 03:11:32.280
cruising series as they were going through how back in the day they were

03:11:32.280 --> 03:11:38.440
like they basically started off from their dorm dorm rooms at MIT to the

03:11:38.440 --> 03:11:42.800
point where they they made they made mod kits for their for existing arcade

03:11:42.800 --> 03:11:47.440
arcade cabs like one like one for missile command that actually extended

03:11:47.440 --> 03:11:52.400
the gameplay but in the sense that you know you would get more revenue because

03:11:52.400 --> 03:11:55.640
the the challenges would be harder you wouldn't be playing the same thing and

03:11:55.640 --> 03:11:59.760
with your guy with a with a single quarter and sheer sheer skill could just

03:11:59.760 --> 03:12:04.280
like stay there for hours on end so you know it gets to the point where they get

03:12:04.280 --> 03:12:08.880
to buy Atari and then they get picked up and then they start creating this pac-man

03:12:08.880 --> 03:12:13.760
and to the point where it leads up to the the crash we're running long here

03:12:13.760 --> 03:12:19.880
Zaku let me let me just quickly ask you your favorite thing about the whole con

03:12:19.880 --> 03:12:25.760
certain prizes swag it's just like a free shit I mean I think I played

03:12:25.760 --> 03:12:30.240
battlefield 3 and a cop you know in a mini tournament and all I got was a 4

03:12:30.240 --> 03:12:35.340
gig USB drive but it was just like not only that is the after party the the

03:12:35.340 --> 03:12:39.760
curse party the curse is like a service site that hosts like all these forms

03:12:39.760 --> 03:12:43.360
like including ones for Minecraft they had a killer party with like open bar

03:12:43.360 --> 03:12:48.840
and everything and the whole works and that was yesterday and they're saying

03:12:48.840 --> 03:12:52.280
me and Adam had had ourselves a kick-ass time all right Zaku I gotta let you go

03:12:52.280 --> 03:12:55.040
but I'm glad you had a great time actually I'm a little jealous but I

03:12:55.040 --> 03:13:00.260
guess I'm happy all right take care Zaku all right have a good one later some

03:13:00.260 --> 03:13:05.760
things haven't changed all this coming out of people's MIT dorm rooms I I love

03:13:05.760 --> 03:13:09.040
hearing the stories about the old game design though my god those guys really

03:13:09.040 --> 03:13:13.160
loved what they did and it's just folks that were younger than you or I am now

03:13:13.160 --> 03:13:18.440
you have designed these classic classic games all right I have to close up Skype

03:13:18.440 --> 03:13:22.200
you guys we were running long now and I'm really sorry to those didn't get

03:14:27.240 --> 03:14:32.360
company that we talked about a lot about here on the show Activision Blizzard has

03:14:32.360 --> 03:14:38.080
been sued for patent infringement of virtual worlds usage due to World of

03:14:38.080 --> 03:14:44.680
Warcraft and Call of Duty they're being sued by worlds Inc worlds Inc claims

03:14:44.680 --> 03:14:48.400
that World of Warcraft and Call of Duty are violating the patent quote

03:14:48.400 --> 03:14:51.760
technologies created by worlds have helped the business of virtual worlds

03:14:51.760 --> 03:14:55.400
and gaming and the sale of virtual goods to grow into a multi-billion dollar

03:14:55.400 --> 03:15:00.980
industry that was from worlds Inc CEO Tom Kidron while we are pleased to see

03:15:00.980 --> 03:15:04.480
the gaming industry and is rapidly growing customer base of enthusiastically

03:15:04.480 --> 03:15:10.200
embraced our patented technologies we deserve fair compensation for their use

03:15:10.200 --> 03:15:14.400

03:15:14.400 --> 03:15:19.640
2008 for city of heroes it was dismissed after a undisclosed settlement was

03:15:19.640 --> 03:15:23.520
obtained worlds Inc has been in business since either 99 or 2000 you know what I

03:15:23.520 --> 03:15:26.600
don't know of them but to say they invented I've heard the name too but to

03:15:26.600 --> 03:15:29.900
say they they're responsible for World of Warcraft and Call of Duty it's kind

03:15:29.900 --> 03:15:34.520
of like dude I think copyright law online especially needs to be updated

03:15:34.520 --> 03:15:42.160
because it's things have changed since the Revolutionary War just slightly ah

03:15:42.160 --> 03:15:47.300
