00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Orange Lounge Radio

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Tonight, November 25th, 2012, could a new scaled down Xbox 360 be on the way?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Sony's credit rating is reduced, and Japan bans the sale of a controversial cartridge.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live with this episode number 483 for November 25th, 2012.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here to talk to you guys about video games and what's going on in gaming culture and so forth with my co-host.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Say hello, first off, to the one, the only, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You should really watch where that glass is.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Oh, with the mic cords and everything?

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I didn't want to knock it off and then onto your knee and have you curse loudly, although that might have been funny, but it would have been very poor radio.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yes, broken glass going into my foot, not a good radio time.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
No, but it would have been hilarious here.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Not really. Heart, heart, heart, heart.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Also say hello, what is it, less than slash three.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Hi.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
How are you, Loki?

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Good.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Alright, what's new with you?

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Not much.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Did you have a good holiday?

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yeah, it was fun.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Eat a lot?

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Yes.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Good, good times.

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I read about the adventures of your child sitting under the tree eating spaghetti.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
A spaghetti Thanksgiving?

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Nellie posted something.

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
How does that work?

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Eating spaghetti under the tree.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Or eating some food under the tree.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Maybe turkey?

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Maybe turkey?

36
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Alright.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Anyhow, also say hello to the ever present fourth guest in our chat room.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Live.vognetwork.com is the place to be where you can read comments such as Jason who says,

39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Rob sounds particularly more energetic tonight.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And Brad from Pod Culture says, probably lots of coffee.

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
That's true.

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yes, four cups today.

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
That's true.

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Alright, we do have another guest joining us in studio.

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Somebody new to the show.

46
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Can you believe there's still people in Sacramento who play video games who haven't been on this

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
show?

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But we do have somebody new to the show tonight.

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I don't know if you have a nickname you'd like to go by.

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
What do you want me to introduce you to tonight?

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Wordpress handle is Rakshasa Rani.

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Rakshasa.

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Are you a Kingdom Hearts girl?

54
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Is that where Rakshasa comes from?

55
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
No, no.

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's Rakshasa Rani.

57
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It basically translates to Ogre Queen, but I'm sure it's improperly conjugated.

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Okay, that's alright.

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's alright.

60
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Well, hello and welcome to the show.

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Don't expect me to be able to repeat that.

62
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Can I call you by your first name?

63
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Yes, go right ahead.

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm gonna call you Rachel because that's what your name is.

65
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So hi Rachel, welcome to the show.

66
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Not Indian at all.

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But a good-

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But we could go rahel.

69
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
A good plug for your Wordpress right at the top of the show.

70
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That's the way to sell your site here on Orange Lounge Radio.

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So, welcome to the show.

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You and Jamie go to school together or something like that, right?

73
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
We slave away on the magazine together.

74
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Okay.

75
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Good times.

76
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And we're both kind of subbing on the other side pretty much.

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You know, I've always felt more part of the writing process.

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But this year I'm on the design team whereas Jamie, who is an excellent designer, is now

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
on the English side of it.

80
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Yeah, so we're sort of crossed over.

81
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,000
But that means we both see what goes on on each side and then go, what's up with that?

82
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So, you guys are frenzies from school.

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
So, how did you guys- obviously you guys connected because you're both obviously geeky gals,

84
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
which is great.

85
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We love geeky gals.

86
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
How did you guys kind of find that connection?

87
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Through many rides home.

88
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yes.

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
And series of conversations the first semester.

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
And yarn.

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yes.

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh, yes.

93
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And yarn.

94
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Which I'm working on during the show again.

95
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Lots of you.

96
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
More crochet.

97
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You were mentioning earlier that you are very experienced with yarn and all that stuff.

98
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
So, very cool.

99
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And she's a fantastic potter.

100
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Oh, thank you.

101
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
And that's really my only contribution to the yarn store is because my mother's more

102
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
of a crocheter.

103
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
My sister knits.

104
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I do these things called yarn bowls.

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And basically it's just, you know, yarn accessories works out pretty well for me.

106
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Well, all this talk about knitting and crocheting and pottery is going to go over great with

107
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
our teen male audience.

108
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But-

109
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Hi, boys.

110
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Let me ask you a little- I play games and I do pottery.

111
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Let's talk about games for a minute.

112
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Do pottery, not pot.

113
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
We were talking a little bit before the show and you mentioned you have a love of Silent

114
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Hill.

115
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Oh, yes.

116
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yes.

117
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
It's going to be really fun for us here at OLR.

118
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What's your favorite out of the series?

119
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Ooh, it's kind of a toss up.

120
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I kind of like 3 and 4.

121
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I love 4 for its story more than its gameplay aspects.

122
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Interesting.

123
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You don't hear a lot of people sticking up for 4.

124
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I think 4 was better than people say it was.

125
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It was intriguing.

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But weird that you didn't say 2.

127
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I can't get past the voice acting.

128
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Did you ever try that Silent Hill HD collection where they redid it all?

129
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
No.

130
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I haven't played it either because my understanding is they somehow made it worse.

131
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
So, I don't know.

132
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Go with that.

133
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What other games do you play?

134
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What other games do you like?

135
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What are you a fan of?

136
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I've been playing a lot of Portal recently.

137
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I love Portal, but it's really on my 4-year-old nephew's account too.

138
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
He's a huge fan of Portal 2 and that is literally the first thing out of his mouth any time

139
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
he comes over to visit.

140
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I've got that pretty much.

141
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I could navigate that in my sleep.

142
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Nice.

143
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
No wonder you and Jamie get along.

144
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
She would not shut up about Portal until she discovered Mass Effect.

145
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yeah.

146
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So, now I've got to get her.

147
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Oh, God.

148
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Did she suck you into that too?

149
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Not yet.

150
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I've been telling her about it.

151
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I've got Becky.

152
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Becky's already beaten the third game now.

153
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Wait a minute.

154
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
She's playing through Leviathan now.

155
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Did Becky play a lot of video games before?

156
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
No.

157
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
None.

158
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I should tell her that we're talking about her because she's actually making dinner for

159
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Julian right now.

160
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Oh, okay.

161
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
But she's like, I found out that the controllers are ergonomic.

162
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
They don't hurt.

163
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So, she's been playing through everything on Xbox 360.

164
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I figured it out.

165
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Mass Effect 3, or Mass Effect the series, is like Fifty Shades of Grey.

166
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's like Fifty Shades of Garris.

167
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Fifty Shades of Garris.

168
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
There you go.

169
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
A.K.A.

170
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Turian Pene.

171
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Shade 1, calibrations.

172
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Shade 2, more calibrations.

173
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Shade 3.

174
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Can you come back later?

175
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm trying to do some calibration.

176
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
No, but I'm actually super looking forward to Omega.

177
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You have to play Mass Effect.

178
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The first one's free.

179
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000

180
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
A supporter, Rachel, in the chatroom.

181
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Shane Olenko says, yay, someone else likes 4.

182
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
4 was awesome.

183
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
4 was pretty cool.

184
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Shane is a huge Silent Hill fan.

185
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So, let's see.

186
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Enact Deft.

187
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Portal is the most fun.

188
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Portal is the most fun.

189
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Portal 2 is the best.

190
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Those two statements contradict each other in an oddly positive way.

191
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I like it.

192
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I like it.

193
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Tigerclaw says, I don't even want to know what Turian Vag looks like.

194
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You'll find out in the Omega DLC this week.

195
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Actually, there is an artist that I follow that did a very, very good comic called First Contact.

196
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's about the whole, you know, Shepard Garris.

197
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's not like First Contact with her butt, is it?

198
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
No.

199
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
No, it's Turian Pain.

200
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
But anyway, she also did a series of drawings of what she thinks the Vag of other species looks like.

201
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Why?

202
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Why, why, why?

203
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Because inquiring minds want to know.

204
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
But the thing is, she's actually a super, super good artist.

205
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And that's what she spends her talents on.

206
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So her work is actually rather realistic.

207
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
And it would make logical sense.

208
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Oh my god.

209
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I can't.

210
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Did someone say portfolio?

211
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Anyhow, let me bring up another random comment in the chat room to try and stir this conversation in a different direction.

212
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'm going to bring up another game I know you told me about earlier, Rachel.

213
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Brad from Pod Culture says, ooh, Steam has Arkham City for $7.50.

214
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That's another game series you said you were into, right?

215
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Oh, yes, yes.

216
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
As a matter of fact, first time I installed Arkham Asylum, I did one complete playthrough throughout two days

217
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:24,000
because I didn't want to have to, you know, yeah, I installed it and then I didn't register it or whatever.

218
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
So I couldn't save it.

219
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
So I basically just played the thing for two days straight.

220
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And then Arkham City came out, I played that thing into the ground.

221
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And like, I'm, you know, I come from a family of completionists.

222
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So it's like I was in there doing like every single Riddler challenge.

223
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
And oh my god, I lost so much sleep.

224
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's like I could feel my eyes just ready to fall out of my skull at that point.

225
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
But you did it.

226
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Did you do all the DLC too?

227
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
No, no, I'm saving those for a special occasion.

228
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And you haven't really finished it.

229
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I know.

230
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Twitch, Twitch, Twitch.

231
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I was trying to see if I could get her to Twitch.

232
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Were you a fan of the comics before playing the game?

233
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Um, you know, not so much the comics.

234
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I got into the games mainly because of the cartoon connection.

235
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Kevin Conroy, awesome.

236
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Ah, okay, the anime series.

237
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Oh yeah.

238
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And you know, him and Mark Hamill, they are basically Batman and the Joker for me.

239
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's all kinds of happies.

240
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
There's a lot of people on your team when it comes to that.

241
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So, awesome.

242
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Um, well, let's see.

243
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I was mad at the DLC.

244
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Huh.

245
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I didn't play all the DLC.

246
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Well, you know the thing with, um, okay, the game's been out forever so I'm just gonna freaking say it.

247
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
About, um, Harley.

248
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Jump ahead, quick.

249
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
If you don't want spoilers, jump ahead.

250
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Mute for one minute.

251
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
About Harley's pregnancy test.

252
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And then, like, in the DLC there's like 20 bajillion of them that are all negative.

253
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Oh, they're trying to fix that for a possible third game or something.

254
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Except, like, there was the ending where she was singing a lullaby.

255
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So, um, whatever.

256
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Or, you know, that would be like a defining character moment where she thinks she's pregnant but she's really gone even crazier.

257
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So it's like a Joker doll that she's calling her baby.

258
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I kind of like if it would move in that direction.

259
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Interesting.

260
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Interesting.

261
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,000
She sounds like one of those crazy women, like the type that would draw vaginas of alien races and post them on her Tumblr.

262
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You know what?

263
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I linked the Tumblr in the chat room.

264
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Oh, great.

265
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Thank you, thank you so much for that.

266
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm sure Loki's pulling it up right now.

267
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Alright.

268
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:23,000
For the record, Rob, despite the comic being fairly graphic, it actually is very...

269
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's artsy.

270
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It actually tells a story.

271
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
We'll leave it at that.

272
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
We'll leave it at that.

273
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Alright, I would have to ask you before we move on to a real kickoff topic.

274
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Rachel, what's your gaming platform of choice?

275
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Do you have a particular console you tend to play stuff on or are you more PC gal?

276
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Where do you lean?

277
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Shiznite.

278
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Shiznite.

279
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You know, I tend to gravitate towards PC just because I'm big on retro games and a lot of emulators available there.

280
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Ah, I see.

281
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yeah, but if you twist my arm and force me to pick, I'd have to go with a Nintendo console just out of sheer loyalty.

282
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Oh, okay.

283
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You're one of those.

284
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
No, I'm just kidding.

285
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Yeah, I'm one of those.

286
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Loki will love you.

287
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Alright.

288
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I don't know anything wrong with Nintendo consoles.

289
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Just, you know, the Wii U's just not worth the money.

290
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Well, we'll get into plenty more of that in a minute, but I did want to talk about some other kickoff topics here real quick.

291
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Obviously, we hope all you guys here in the States had a happy Thanksgiving holiday, you know, and around the world.

292
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Hope you had a good week.

293
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Obviously, retail madness over the weekend.

294
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I kind of hate that that stuff is starting to eclipse Thanksgiving.

295
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I think a lot of people are growing very frustrated with it.

296
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But it is the time to get some good deals and the Steam sale, obviously, is another good place to get deals.

297
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Civ V, which I never showed up about on this show, great deal going on right now.

298
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I was really tempted to get Borderlands 2, which I know is on sale.

299
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm curious if you guys picked up any gaming deals over these past few days.

300
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Oh, yes.

301
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
What'd you get?

302
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What'd you get, Dark Sakura?

303
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I bought They Bleed Pixels and Awesomenauts.

304
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And then I bought Dragon Age Origins, the deluxe edition through Origin, although I wish I'd waited and just gotten it through Steam.

305
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Because Steam was a penny cheaper.

306
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
One whole penny?

307
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But I hate Origin. I prefer playing through Steam.

308
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And then I actually just bought Sonic Generations on Steam, because it's eight freaking bucks.

309
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And it's Sonic Generations.

310
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
With a really screwed up last level, seriously.

311
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Because Dan and I sat and watched the whole playthrough.

312
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Nice.

313
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Rachel, did you take advantage of any of the gaming deals this weekend?

314
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I did not.

315
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I was actually working through Black Friday, even though it wasn't really Black Friday-ish for our shop.

316
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I still saw a bit of ugliness, so I was more preoccupied with the working part of that.

317
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
That's fair enough. Fair enough. It happens.

318
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You brave, brave retail people that had to work those front lines on Friday, I don't envy you in the slightest, because people are crazy.

319
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Although, I was telling you guys before the show, I went out on Black Friday at about eight o'clock at night.

320
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Because we needed stuff from Target. I needed shampoo.

321
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
So we went to Target at eight o'clock. It's fine.

322
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
We go out at night on Black Friday and after all the crazies have gone to bed.

323
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Totally fine. Just like any other day.

324
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Even went to Fry's and got some upgrades for the studio I'll talk about in a minute.

325
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Loki, did you take advantage of any deals?

326
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I bought nothing because I have no money to buy things with.

327
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
That's what happens when you're a parent. You have no money.

328
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I don't think it's just being a parent. You're also a homeowner and you just bought a new car.

329
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
That's a big one.

330
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I don't know. I just feel like giving people crap for small reasons.

331
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Congrats on the used car.

332
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And also the other thing too, the last Steam sale I bought a bunch of games.

333
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I still haven't played most of them.

334
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And I haven't played most of the games that I got through my Humble Bundle.

335
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
So I'm just kind of like, hey, that's cool.

336
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Borderlands 2 is down to like 30 bucks, whatever.

337
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Am I really going to play it? Probably not.

338
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,000
So it's just kind of answering the question, is this really something I'm going to play?

339
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
And a lot of times it's no, I'm probably not going to play that.

340
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
So that's why I haven't really been buying anything.

341
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I didn't really buy anything either.

342
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I did buy another Wii U game when I was at Fry's picking up the new router.

343
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I got Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed for the Wii U just because some of my other friends had it and was giving it positive reviews.

344
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's only a deal because it's one of the two non $60 games, I think.

345
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I think $50.

346
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's $40 actually.

347
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
So I think I paid $40 for it.

348
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Maybe I did get a deal and didn't realize it.

349
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Yeah, I think I only paid $40 for it.

350
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And I might have been a deal then because I think that was supposed to be like a $50 game.

351
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And I did get a deal.

352
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Yeah, I only paid $40 for it, I'm pretty sure.

353
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So that's pretty cool.

354
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
And there was one other game that was cheaper than the others.

355
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I don't remember what it was.

356
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Oh, well.

357
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Anyhow, let's talk about, since we are talking about the games we got deals on,

358
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
let's talk about our actual gaming weeks and the games we've been playing this week.

359
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Dark Sakura, why don't you start?

360
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Mass Effect 3.

361
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I beat 2. I'm on 3 again for like my fifth playthrough.

362
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
My fifth playthrough in what, four months?

363
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
And I actually touched some WoW.

364
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
So you guys wouldn't kick me out of the guild.

365
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Going back to Mass Effect a minute, I mean obviously you've talked tons about it on the show,

366
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
but I found the modding you were doing this week interesting.

367
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Because you were posting to our little rabid fan community we have on Facebook.

368
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And you had like these different colored skinned shepherds.

369
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Like you went in and had like a green skinned shepherd and this weird stuff.

370
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Okay, I'll tell you where this came about.

371
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And this is actually me using a little bit of what I've actually learned in college about colors.

372
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And trying to make, I'm trying to actually match Zaid's skin tone.

373
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
But a little bit lighter because I'm trying to get that, it's actually closer to Aller's.

374
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Because I want that kind of golden skin tone.

375
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm working on making a somewhat middle eastern looking shepherd.

376
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And I've tweaked the eyes, I've tweaked the nose, and now I'm tweaking the skin tone.

377
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
But it's either coming out like too much of a muted chocolate.

378
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
You know, like the plain milk chocolate with no extra skin tone to it.

379
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Nothing blushing, nothing under that.

380
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And so I'm playing with blushes, I'm playing with all this.

381
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And then I had an idea.

382
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I was like, well if all of this is showing through whatever the skin is, can I make a blue shepherd?

383
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
So I changed all the values to blue.

384
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Which is 255 blue, 0 red, 0 green.

385
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Blue shepherd.

386
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It worked.

387
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
So then I did red shepherd.

388
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Then I did green shepherd.

389
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Then I did yellow shepherd, which looks more like puke green shepherd.

390
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
But I could get it to work.

391
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Because I've gotten purple hair.

392
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
The hair works.

393
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Congratulations for now fusing the fan communities of Avatar and Mass Effect.

394
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
There already were blue people in Mass Effect though.

395
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
There were a sorry.

396
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It doesn't matter, you don't need more blue people.

397
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
But I was actually planning on giving her white hair.

398
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And then making her blue and calling her, you know, shepherd smurf.

399
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
But no.

400
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
But I mean that means I could play through my whole game with a blue shepherd.

401
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:11,000
And I went back to, and I got a really nice skin tone that unfortunately only looks really nice in bright light.

402
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's the picture that I posted from the Citadel where she looked kind of badass.

403
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
And I've modified my coalesced ion eye to add extra outfits.

404
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
There is a naked skin for female shepherd.

405
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
However, she has no real butt crack.

406
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
There's a naked one for the guys but I can't find it.

407
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
What is it with the girls in the nudity tonight?

408
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's no problem. You can fix that butt crack problem by just editing the texture.

409
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
There actually is an edited texture.

410
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Buy her bigger panties. That's how you fix the butt crack problem.

411
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's like there's no bits to show and no coloration in certain places.

412
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
And someone has made, by the way.

413
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I found that ages ago but I didn't know that it actually was based off of real texture.

414
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
And you can unlock the texture and it's like okay whatever.

415
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
And who'd have thunk it? It's the person that draws the vaginas.

416
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
No, it's not the same person.

417
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
It's not the same person.

418
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:06,000
But there's actually, did you know that there are two different fabric textures for the underwear?

419
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
There's shiny and matte.

420
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I just learned something that I never thought I'd ever know in my life.

421
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
But I've had my shepherd running around in an all black uniform.

422
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You know, it's actually black and a lighter black for the camo.

423
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I have seen some hilarious gifs on Tumblr of, I guess there's a way to hack it so that you can play male shepherd in his underwear through the whole game.

424
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,000
And there's some hilarious gifs of like, you know, male shepherd like jumping out of a starship and he's like in his underwear.

425
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It looks really funny.

426
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:46,000
No, you can actually, in the coalesced I&I, because basically all you do, you can add lines to have it pull different textures for different outfits.

427
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
So you can actually wear armor in casual look and wear casual clothes into armor.

428
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
There's also a way to use Ashley's clothes, but I went and looked through the actual meshes.

429
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
The reason why there's a big problem with people using Ashley's face is first of all, it's fully colored.

430
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
So if you have it over a colored face already, it's going to show up orange and part of her chest is rendered.

431
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
So you'd actually get shepherd with a hole in her chest if you try to use Ashley's clothes with no boobs pretty much.

432
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Oh boy. All right.

433
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Yeah, this is what I spent all week doing.

434
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You're going to need your own podcast about Mass Effect at some point.

435
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Just wait.

436
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
All right. Moving on.

437
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
But I did play another game.

438
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Oh, what else?

439
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Dragon Age Origins.

440
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
And I made a Dalish, which I sometimes want to call a Danish.

441
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
She's a redhead, kind of cool.

442
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
And I don't know that I like the game so much yet, but I'm going to give it a try.

443
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
You know, it might be one of those games that, you know, I didn't really love it the first time I played it, but I went back later and I liked it a little more.

444
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Like it's just kind of sometimes games don't really hit you the first time.

445
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'm just really not a big fan of combat in it.

446
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
But I might go back and see about getting Dragon Age 2.

447
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Gotcha.

448
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I mean, which I started playing on Xbox 360 and got pretty far in until that stupid battle where Fenris is like, I'm going to be emo and kill you.

449
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Now, see, that's really weird because most of the fandom really doesn't like Dragon Age 2.

450
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
But it plays like Mass Effect.

451
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I mean, really, I like the way it plays. It handles like Mass Effect.

452
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
That's why I could get into Mass Effect so easily is because it handled the same way.

453
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Well, you know, there's a third one coming out. Maybe it'll be somewhere in the middle.

454
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Maybe.

455
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Let's see. All right.

456
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
And I played very solitaire.

457
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Of course you did. Of course you did.

458
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It sucks.

459
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
All right. Let me move on.

460
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Rachel, since you're our guest, why don't you go next?

461
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
What kind of games, what's gaming week look like for you?

462
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You know, since school is on, you know, I have a lot of time preoccupied just by schoolwork.

463
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
So the only time I really get to play games is when the kids are around.

464
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
So it's, you know, more cinematic stuff like Pikmin, Portal 2, things with a lot of really bright characters.

465
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I am, you know, I am really, you know, I could never get enough replaying of Portal 2, though,

466
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
just because the mythos behind it is so fascinating.

467
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Because I'm a writer. I'm not sure if you knew that.

468
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I just learned something.

469
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
There you go.

470
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
The more you know.

471
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Yeah.

472
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
So, and I just, you know, there's, I find something new in every single replay.

473
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Like, there's always one more secret door I haven't gone through.

474
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
There's one more connection to Half-Life and just, you know, the way they paint their characters.

475
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
It's, everything's pretty three-dimensional.

476
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
So I appreciate it on a couple different levels.

477
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You should talk to Alan about Half-Life at some point.

478
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I was going to say, are you a big Half-Life fan as well?

479
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
You know, I haven't gotten into it yet.

480
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm, you know, I'm saving up a big chunk of time where I can just play, blow through the entire series so far.

481
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Now's a great time with the Black Mesa source being out there.

482
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Definitely look that up.

483
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I am. I'm going to blow through it.

484
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Then I can get pissed off that there's not an episode two.

485
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
All right.

486
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Well, if that's all you want to share about your week, then I'll move on to Loki.

487
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
How was your gaming week?

488
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I played Black Ops 2 a bit.

489
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
That was fun.

490
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
And then a little bit of Modern Warfare 3, although this week we should be switching over to Black Ops 2.

491
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Just waiting for our copies from Activision to come in.

492
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,000
And then a lot of Minecraft.

493
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Just been working on trying to set up the rest of the mob arena and also some other stuff.

494
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Because the website I had set up had went down because the free URL forwarding company, co.cc, went under.

495
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
And all the, like, five million domains that they had are poof, gone.

496
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
So I actually got a legit domain now.

497
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
So it's now at vog-minecraft.com.

498
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And there's not really anything there other than the map right now.

499
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
But eventually there'll be something there.

500
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
So I put that in our chat room.

501
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Vog-minecraft.com.

502
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
And there's also a Twitter account to go along with that.

503
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
So, vog-minecraft at Twitter.

504
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Look at you!

505
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So, yeah.

506
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
That's great.

507
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And, yeah.

508
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
So I've been kind of busy with stuff this week.

509
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
And then hopefully I'll get working on the website soon.

510
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I don't really know what I want to do with it, but I've got it for a while.

511
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
So we'll play around with that.

512
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
And then, what else did I do this week?

513
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I don't think I played anything else.

514
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
No, that was it.

515
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
That was all I played.

516
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I actually had a lot of time to play some games thanks to the holiday break.

517
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
And I didn't have too much going on outside of Thanksgiving Day itself.

518
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Obviously I've been able to spend more time with the Wii U.

519
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Because on the last show it was launch day.

520
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I had only really spent like an hour with it.

521
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
So now I've been able to spend some quality time with the Wii U.

522
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
And I've played three different games on the Wii U.

523
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
And two of them are the ones that everybody's been playing.

524
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I'll talk first about Nintendo Land.

525
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Nintendo Land is a collection of mini-games, basically.

526
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I think it's framed a lot better than Wii Sports was.

527
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I think Monita, though, as a character will get a little bit irritating to some people.

528
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,000
But she serves her purpose, especially for trying to get those that are not as familiar with how to play a video game acquainted with the games.

529
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
There are some pretty neat games in there.

530
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I think I like the mini-games in it more than I like Wii Sports.

531
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Because let's be real.

532
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
At the end of the day, Wii Tennis was about flailing.

533
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
There wasn't a lot of skill to it.

534
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
There wasn't a lot that went into it.

535
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
It was just like imagination with the help of this controller.

536
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Wii Bowling was slightly a little better.

537
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
You felt like you were a little more in control of your actions.

538
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
But it was kind of, eh, at the end of the day as well.

539
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I mean, Wii Sports, when all is said and done,

540
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I know not everybody's going to agree with this comment.

541
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I understand why it ends up on the top 100 gaming list and all that.

542
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It was a very influential game.

543
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I don't think Wii Sports is actually a really good game.

544
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Especially if you're more of a hardcore gamer.

545
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
It's really not a good game.

546
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
It's a great technological feat.

547
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
But it's not really a good game.

548
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I like Nintendo Land because as a gamer,

549
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I feel like there's more game in it.

550
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
There's more to actually achieve.

551
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
The Metroid Blast was fun.

552
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
The F-Zero Race, it's certainly not F-Zero,

553
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
but it's simple enough.

554
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Kind of like Atari 2600 basic, but all of these modern graphics.

555
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
It's fun.

556
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
The Donkey Kong course is surprisingly,

557
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
like, it's like one of those Mega Man hard games

558
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
and all it is is tilting.

559
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
But it's surprisingly quite a bit of fun.

560
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And some of the different mini games,

561
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
especially in a party environment,

562
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,000
the Mario Chase, the Animal Crossing, Luigi's Mansion, all hilarious.

563
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
We played those on Thanksgiving Day and they were all just a ton of fun.

564
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I think Mario Chase was my personal favorite out of the bunch,

565
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
though Luigi's Mansion is really good as well,

566
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
and Animal Crossing is its own thing.

567
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
But, I mean, at its core,

568
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
those three games are all kind of chase games.

569
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
They're just like a different twist on the chase element.

570
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Like in Luigi's Mansion, you're hidden

571
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
and you're trying to grab the others before they grab you.

572
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
In Mario Chase, they're just trying to grab you.

573
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
In Animal Crossing, you control two people

574
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
and there's the whole eating the pellets.

575
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I mean, I guess it's a little more different.

576
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Tigerclaw brings up in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com,

577
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
what about that Pachinko in Nintendo Land, the Pachinko game?

578
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I call it Plinko, but yeah, it's pretty much the same thing.

579
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Because, you know, they're pretty much the same thing.

580
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Pa-plinko?

581
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
No, Plinko.

582
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I know, I was saying Pa-plinko.

583
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Pa-plinko?

584
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Instead of Pachinko, Pa-plinko.

585
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Pa-plinko? Yeah, okay, that works.

586
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
But there's a Pa-plinko game you play to get the unlocks,

587
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
but, eh, I could give or take it.

588
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,000
The unlock is a little bit silly.

589
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
But as a pack-in game, overall, it's fine.

590
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I would see myself revisiting this game

591
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
far more than I would revisit Wii Sports.

592
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Mario U, Super Mario Wii U, is great.

593
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
It's HD Mario, it's what you'd expect.

594
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
What I love about it is that it's not just a game

595
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
with the depth of Super Mario World,

596
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
but it has all these little extra modes as well

597
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
to kind of enhance it, like the course

598
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
for get from start to finish

599
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
by getting the least number of coins possible,

600
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
or speed runs, or all these other types of twists

601
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
that are built into it.

602
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
And supposedly, it has some type of spot pass feature.

603
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I don't know if it's going to have leaderboards or what.

604
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
But even if it didn't have all that,

605
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I like playing those little side missions as well.

606
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
The difficulty level of the game ramps up surprisingly quick,

607
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
and there's some really hard stuff.

608
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I had to use an FAQ to get past one of the levels.

609
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I couldn't find the stinking door out of the ghost house.

610
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And then come to find out, there's like a second one

611
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I probably would have never have found.

612
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:17,000
So I'm liking Mario Wii U as a really solid Mario game,

613
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
even more than I think the one that was previously out on Wii,

614
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Wii Regular.

615
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
And I don't know if that's just because

616
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
the huge step up in the graphics or what.

617
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
The only negatives I can see to the game?

618
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Go ahead.

619
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I'm sorry, just what popped right into my head

620
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
when you said Wii Regular.

621
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
What?

622
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Does that mean that the Wii U needs fiber?

623
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Stop.

624
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
All right.

625
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
The screen doesn't do a lot for Mario.

626
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
It does in multiplayer, as I understand,

627
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
because you can create blocks and all that stuff.

628
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
But as a single player, all the screen does

629
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
is mirror what's on your TV.

630
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
If you want to do the whole I play something on my Wii U

631
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
while you watch something on TV, that's great.

632
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
If you have control of your TV,

633
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
it doesn't really add a lot to the experience.

634
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Luckily, it's a gorgeous game to look at,

635
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
even with all the little touches in the background.

636
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
They have little dancing Miis that show up in the background and stuff.

637
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Just all these little touches that are really cool.

638
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And the sound thing that I really hyped up last week is great.

639
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
The surround sound it kind of creates

640
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,000
between the pad and the regular stereo is pretty cool.

641
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
So, yeah, Mario is solid,

642
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
and I'm sure most people that will get a Wii U

643
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
will pick this game up, and it makes sense.

644
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Absolutely.

645
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
One other game I've been playing on the Wii U

646
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
that was one of the launch titles.

647
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Sonic Racing, no, Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed,

648
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
which is a game that's actually on the Xbox 360

649
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
and the PlayStation 3 as well.

650
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
They also have the Wii U version.

651
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
This is the game we've been talking about on the show.

652
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
We've kind of been joking about it and having fun with it

653
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
because it has Danica Patrick very randomly as a character.

654
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
It's an amazing eyeliner.

655
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
And Wreck-It Ralph, and all these other Sega characters,

656
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
like Metal Sonic, Beat,

657
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
one of the taxi cab drivers from Crazy Taxi,

658
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
supposedly Alex Kidd gets unlocked at some point.

659
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I'm really surprised at how much I'm enjoying this game.

660
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
And I took a look at some of the reviews online

661
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
and some of the talk in Miiverse and so forth,

662
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
and a lot of people razzing it for being buggy,

663
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
and I will admit there's been some odd collision detection things,

664
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
but nothing that detracted from the experience so much.

665
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I was, like, hating the game.

666
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
In fact, I found myself most of the time

667
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
actually really impressed with some of the level design.

668
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
The stages are all huge stages,

669
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,000
and they will seamlessly go from go-karting to flying a plane,

670
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
and Danica Patrick's car turns into, like, an afterburner jet,

671
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,000
which is kind of funny, and on the water,

672
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
and it kind of just seamlessly transitions between all these different phases.

673
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
And I was liking it.

674
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I was showing you girls before the show tonight,

675
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I showed you the Skies of Arcadia level,

676
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
and you saw how, like, you'll do the first lap

677
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
and then in the second lap, the pirate ships, like, start attacking the town

678
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
and are blowing up the road and all this stuff,

679
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
and there's a lot going on.

680
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I was really into it.

681
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I got to admit, I'm kind of liking this game,

682
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I think, a little more than the online impressions.

683
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I mean, it's got not just a regular mode,

684
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
but all these, like, special little games in it,

685
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
like boost mode and kill the other people first,

686
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
and there's a battle mode.

687
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
You can play it online on the Wii U.

688
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Apparently, the advantage that the Wii U has over the other versions

689
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
is that the Wii U is up to five players, thanks to the second screen.

690
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
It's not just a copy of the first screen in single-player mode

691
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
unless you want it to be.

692
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
If you swipe the screen, you get a copy of the TV,

693
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
but if you don't, you get a rear-view mirror and a map,

694
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
you know, kind of what you'd expect in your racing game on the second screen.

695
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
So, yeah, I was really surprised.

696
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I was kind of like playing it going,

697
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,000
you know, Sega did help with that F-Zero game that was on the GameCube,

698
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
and I got to say, this feels like kind of the closest thing

699
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I'm going to get to an F-Zero game for a little while,

700
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
unless maybe they're going to work on it, which I really hope they do.

701
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Sugar Rush.

702
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Or, yeah, or just flat out do a Sugar Rush game.

703
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Sugar Rush.

704
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
It's weird because the Wreck-It Ralph thing, like, I don't,

705
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
I mean, it's cool that Wreck-It Ralph and Danica Patrick are in there, I guess,

706
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
but there's not really a lot else.

707
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Like, you don't have the Sugar Rush stage, or at least I haven't got it yet,

708
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
or any of that, so it's interesting.

709
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Going to some of the comments from our chatters at live.vognetwork.com,

710
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Tigerclaw says, the new Sonic racing game is a lot of fun,

711
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
but boy, it gets pretty hard when doing the medium difficulty

712
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
on many of the races and difficulty.

713
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I can't get past the drift challenges on medium.

714
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Yeah, I can do some of it on medium, but, like, the boost challenge,

715
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I couldn't even do that on regular.

716
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
And here's a little tip for anybody struggling with a game.

717
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
If you flop on a stage four times, it'll let you just skip it on the map.

718
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
So, you know, but you'll still need stars.

719
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
You'll have to compensate the stars from somewhere else

720
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
in order to be able to get the unlock, so I don't know.

721
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Tigerclaw suggests that maybe some of the Wreck-It Ralph stuff will be DLC.

722
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Well, I don't know how the Wii U is going to handle that,

723
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
and I will say that part of it kind of concerns me

724
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
that the Wii U doesn't seem to have a DLC system in place.

725
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
It's the reason I haven't picked up Mass Effect 3

726
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,000
is I hear that none of the multiplayer enhancements

727
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
they've done since launch are available.

728
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
And I'm like, well, then what's the friggin' point?

729
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Like, part of the reason the Mass Effect 3 multiplayer is so amazing

730
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
is because of all the constant DLC they've been putting out.

731
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,000
And I understand that some of the single-player DLC is included,

732
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
but they're not going to get Omega. Why?

733
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Because Nintendo can't do DLC yet.

734
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Or if they can, they're not doing it a lot or something. I don't know.

735
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,000
So that part of it, with all the positive I'm saying about the Wii U

736
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
and overall I am satisfied with my purchase,

737
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I would be in love with my purchase if some of these other things were corrected.

738
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
But, I don't know, Nintendo has, over the past week,

739
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
been building a lot into the system.

740
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,000
We got, over the past week, we got the Netflix, the Amazon, the YouTube,

741
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
the Hulu, and all that showed up, like, you know, just day after day after day.

742
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,000
And I gotta say, the YouTube app in particular,

743
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
very different look from the other, the PS3 and the Xbox ones.

744
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
It's not bad.

745
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Bobby said he didn't care for it, right?

746
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Huh?

747
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Bobby said he didn't care for it, right?

748
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I don't remember what he said about YouTube,

749
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
but the look of it is weird because it doesn't really have any Nintendo branding

750
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
and it doesn't really have Microsoft or something.

751
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
It's just, it's kind of different and it works pretty well,

752
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
especially if you're logged in.

753
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I enjoyed it more than the Xbox version of it,

754
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:37,000
even though it functions similarly, but it still felt easier to use

755
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
and maybe part of that is having the touch pad, I don't know.

756
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
But, yeah.

757
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I don't know.

758
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Tiger Claw on chat says Nintendo is just taking baby steps.

759
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
This is a whole new thing for them, the online community.

760
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Well, yes, but at some point you have to stop letting that be an excuse.

761
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
And I think a lot of us have said, oh, Nintendo, you're just new to the party,

762
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
and so we forgive you.

763
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,000
And it's kind of like, okay, that's true, but it's not an excuse.

764
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Like, playing catch-up, you know, you've had a lot of time to play catch-up.

765
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
You know, you should have thought about some of this during the Wii being out there.

766
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:17,000
But there's some parts about the Wii U like Miiverse is surprisingly interesting.

767
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Like, it's actually something I keep going back to and looking at.

768
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
I like looking at the activity feed of my friends

769
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
and what they've been posting in the games.

770
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
The first-party games really urge you to make public posts in Miiverse to interact with,

771
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
and I find, like, I want to see what my friends are posting,

772
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,000
and the artwork people are doing is amazing.

773
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And I don't know if you guys know this, but in the Wii U, when you turn it on,

774
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
if you have your Wii U always connected to the internet,

775
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
it downloads artwork from around, you know, the community,

776
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
like things that have been popular voted.

777
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
So when you turn on your Wii, you'll see a helping of, like, random games,

778
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
and then you'll see some of the popular comments.

779
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
And they're all these artwork that is, like, really well done and funny.

780
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,000
And so I find it really neat, and I don't know if this is what Nintendo intended,

781
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
but you've got to hand it to them.

782
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
This is something Microsoft and Sony aren't doing with their online,

783
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
so let's give Nintendo some credit here.

784
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,000
The first thing you get when you turn on your system is community.

785
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
You don't even get that with Xbox and Sony.

786
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
That's surprising.

787
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
So if there's one thing Nintendo is doing right when it comes to online,

788
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
community is the first thing you see.

789
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Interesting.

790
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Agreed.

791
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Now, obviously, they have some slow steps in other places,

792
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
but that's one step in the right direction.

793
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
So going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

794
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Raginator in chat says,

795
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,000
Interesting or just a novelty that you'll forget about in a month or two?

796
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
That's a very good question, Raginator,

797
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
and I think a lot of that depends on how well will the games in the future support it.

798
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
You know, and what else will come out?

799
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
What download content is going to come out?

800
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
You know, what's going to keep the people talking?

801
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
What's going to keep the people providing those funny pictures and so forth?

802
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
And will they allow you to add cat pics later on?

803
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Well, apparently, like, people have been doing really random stuff.

804
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Like, I was reading something on my Facebook.

805
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,000
The Destructoid community took over one of the,

806
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
I think it was the Rabbids game community with pictures of Willem Dafoe.

807
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I don't know what the joke is there,

808
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
but, like, they were drawing Willem Dafoe and writing.

809
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I mean, I don't, sorry, I don't have time to read every single website on the internet,

810
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
but, like, I thought it was funny that they're kind of, like, trying to do that.

811
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
But, you know, so yeah, people come up with their own ways to entertain themselves.

812
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:43,000
So it's turning into Game Facts, basically, where they'll take over, like, a message board.

813
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I don't know how well they've succeeded, but yes, possibly.

814
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Fantastic. That's what Nintendo needs is more Game Facts.

815
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Mm-hmm.

816
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Bobby in our chat room wants to clarify some stuff.

817
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Blackwell says, okay, A, Nintendo has a DLC system in place.

818
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
New Super Mario Brothers U will have DLC, for instance.

819
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Okay, that may be true, but where is it?

820
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
It's not here at launch.

821
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
That leaves me to think it's still being built.

822
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Remember my Winchester House comparison from last week?

823
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
I think that's what's happening.

824
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I don't have any proof, but at the same time, where is the DLC?

825
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
It's going to be there at launch.

826
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Remember, they've got six more years.

827
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Okay. Let's see.

828
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,000
And Blackwell said, B, I think YouTube videos look better in the internet browser than in the app.

829
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
And you can watch videos on the gamepad from the browser not available in the app.

830
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Blackwell also clarifying, I guess he reads more destructively than I do.

831
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Blackwell says, the initial joke was Jim Sterling said,

832
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,000
I am remaking the community to be about Willem Dafoe

833
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
because that's a better use of this community than the game.

834
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
The post got moderated away.

835
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Did you not see how many people were pissed off at day one DLC?

836
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:57,000
How pissed would you be if there was day one DLC for New Super Mario Brothers U?

837
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,000
But Bobby, I am pissed off that there isn't day one DLC for the other games to play catch up,

838
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
especially when that DLC is free.

839
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,000
So in the case of Mass Effect 3, yes, I do feel like 100% of the game isn't there,

840
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,000
especially when you're trying to be competitive with these other consoles.

841
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I get that some of the single player DLC, but when you're kind of trying to play catch up,

842
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
you know, I think that part is missing.

843
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
I get what you're saying about the whole, you don't want day one DLC for New Super Mario Brothers Wii U.

844
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I get that, but that's also first party versus third party.

845
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
And, you know, maybe Nintendo hasn't built it because they don't need it for themselves yet,

846
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
so screw everybody else, I don't know.

847
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Anyway.

848
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
Alright, I've talked enough about the Wii U.

849
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Sorry guys, but it's with the hot thing that's going on in gaming right now.

850
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
The other thing I want to talk about in my gaming video, just real quick, I'll just throw this out there.

851
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Despite the fact that I have a shiny new console, it doesn't mean I'm not going to play other stuff.

852
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I've been participating in the Mass Effect 3 weekend challenge like a good player,

853
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:01,000
and I played an epic nine hour match of Civilization V, start to finish.

854
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
And I know some people are going only nine hours.

855
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Yeah, we did kind of an easier skill level,

856
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,000
and we agreed the three of us that were playing would not military strike each other,

857
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
but it was a lot of fun.

858
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:17,000
It was my first Gods and Kings game, start to finish, so I was, you know, thankful I played it.

859
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,000
And I am still enjoying Civ V, and it's on sale right now on Steam,

860
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,000
and I would support a purchase of that if you wanted to do that.

861
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
So, all right. Anyhow, that is all I want to say about my gaming week.

862
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Housekeeping tonight.

863
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Obviously, we always like to plug our Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r, and our Facebook,

864
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
facebook.com slash orangelaungeradio, and our Google Plus, search for Orangelaungeradio.

865
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Also, this one's for the live listeners, more so than the podcast listeners.

866
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I'm hoping so far tonight, live listeners, we haven't had any dropouts on the feed.

867
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I know the fact that the stream has been dropping out lately has been very frustrating,

868
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
and so we didn't really know if it was us or if it was the host,

869
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
but there's a good chance that it's us here in studio.

870
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:10,000
So what we did on Friday, Alan and I went out and we got a new router for the studio here.

871
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
So we have like a brand new, it's not like top of the line because I'm sorry,

872
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,000
I didn't have 200 bucks to drop on a router, but we did get one of those like, what is it, 600?

873
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,000
It's like 300 plus 300, it's a huge step up from what we had.

874
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Our last router couldn't even do wireless end, so we did upgrade that.

875
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
We had this whole thing going on where you actually had two networks in the house,

876
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
and one was daisy chained to the other.

877
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Now it's parent router and bridge.

878
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I wrote a post in the VOG Network forums in more detail if you want to see all the parts there,

879
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,000
but I think so far the stream hasn't dropped, and the evil protagonist in our chat says,

880
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
sounds great tonight, so maybe it was us.

881
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I didn't want to let that go forever without trying to fix it, so fingers crossed.

882
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Now that I've talked about it, it's going to drop in the next two minutes.

883
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Just watch.

884
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:03,000
But hey, that's better than 20 times during the show like last week, which was very, very frustrating.

885
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
So thank you to our loyal live listeners who have stuck it out throughout all those drops.

886
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
We're trying to make the situation better for you guys.

887
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I hope it works tonight.

888
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Yeah, Raginator brings up, you know, by bringing up the stream dropping, you just jinxed yourself.

889
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Well, hey, you know what, we got through 48 minutes without one, which beats last week, so let's just hope.

890
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Also, it's a slow news week tonight, you guys, with the holiday going on and everything here in the States,

891
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
but I will tease the coming up in Part B tonight, Match Game.

892
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
We haven't done Match Game in at least a year, so we're going to do Match Game tonight.

893
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
So we will have contestants, one via Skype, one via the chat.

894
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:50,000
So if you want to be potentially our Skype player, make sure you have Orange Lounge Radio all one word added on Skype.

895
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Again, we're not doing that now. We'll get into it in Part B. I'll let you know when to call.

896
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
All right, let's move on into some gaming news.

897
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
All right.

898
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,000
All right.

899
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:07,000
So let's talk a little bit about this Xbox set-top box, which actually was a rumor that we've been hearing about for a while now,

900
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,000
where there is supposed to be some slimmed down Xbox system that the rumor was, I think, originally,

901
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:19,000
that it was only going to be able to play Xbox Live Arcade stuff, which would be a little weird, but I could see that.

902
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I mean, they have a lot of the whole Xbox.

903
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,000
All the symphony of the night you can stand.

904
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
True. Or, you know, if this is going to be like-

905
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
So much Yaris.

906
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
If there's going to be-

907
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I'm interested in this.

908
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
If there's going to be like a digital Xbox where it's not going to have a disk drive or something like that,

909
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
it's going to be built into a TV like as an app.

910
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I could see it maybe like, you know, with games on demand stuff.

911
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I was just about to say, couldn't they do games on demand still, though?

912
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
That's possible.

913
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
All it needs is a USB port and you can suddenly, oh, magical 64 gigs.

914
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:57,000
So they're saying, of course, anonymous sources are telling them that it's going to be dubbed Xbox TV.

915
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,000
It's going to support casual games and run on Windows 8.

916
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:07,000
I think it's just going to be kind of like running on, you know, the dashboard that's out there that kind of looks like Windows 8.

917
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:13,000
And I guess some sort of, you know, chips that is going to allow for quick boot ups and that kind of stuff.

918
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:27,000
And they're saying that it's also going to be able to kind of like, I don't know, maybe kind of incorporate, you know, surface stuff or smart glass or anything like that.

919
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,000
And I guess, you know, Microsoft made a statement regarding the set up box plans.

920
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:44,000
They're saying Xbox 360 has found new ways to extend the console lifecycle by introducing controller free experiences with Kinect and reinventing the console with a new dashboard, new entertainment content.

921
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,000
The typical bullshit line they're going to give when the Christmas season is going on and they don't want people to...

922
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Yeah, we are always thinking about what is next for our platform.

923
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
In other words, yeah, that's probably going to be true.

924
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Yeah, in other words, don't think about what's coming out next year. Think about putting a Kinect under your Christmas tree this year. That's exactly what it is.

925
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,000
I wouldn't put a Kinect under your Christmas tree unless you're into dancing games because all the games that have come out have been kind of crap.

926
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
You know what I mean.

927
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I'm just saying, yeah.

928
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Okay, here, okay, I know this is going to sound stupid and I'm going to sound like an idiot, but hear me out here.

929
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Could this be a very corporate challenge to the Ouya?

930
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,000
And I know that comparison is really weird because I know the Ouya's whole thing is open source and all this.

931
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:35,000
But do you think still maybe Microsoft took a look at that whole thing and said, maybe people want a $99 thing they just took up to their TV and play games with.

932
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
And although we sure as hell aren't going to make it open source, maybe we'll make it look like a PC.

933
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Is this maybe a response to the Ouya, if true?

934
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Probably not. I don't think they feel any threat from the Ouya yet because there's no real system there.

935
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I mean, you can't feel a threat about something that's not out yet.

936
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Not a threat, but it's doing what Microsoft does, taking an idea and trying to make it better.

937
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
For better or for worse.

938
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:08,000
I think if anything, they would be kind of going with the whole, well, we've seen some of these integrated like, maybe even looking at Apple TV or something like that.

939
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Obviously, they're just a step away from actually having a system that runs apps and stuff.

940
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I don't know if it's really going to be anything.

941
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I mean, because if you think about it, let's say this comes out a year from now.

942
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Why would I want to buy a stripped down version of the Xbox 360 when the regular Xbox 360 is probably going to be under $100 or just about $100?

943
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,000
I mean, if you think about it, yes, you may not be able to get the brand new system that's out right now.

944
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
But those older systems, they're already at about $100 or just over $100.

945
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,000
So why would I want to, you know, put out something that's going to...

946
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Maybe if it's one of those funky partnerships where it's all built into the TV.

947
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,000
But see, why would you buy something like that that's built into the TV?

948
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Because why do people buy TVs with built-in Blu-ray players?

949
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Why do people buy TVs with built-in Roku and so forth?

950
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
It's like those laserdisc players that had the Sega CD built in it.

951
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
It's dumb. You should never buy a TV with something built into it.

952
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
You know who buys that stuff? My parents.

953
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Because they don't release it. They just want the damn thing to work.

954
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:20,000
This is what older people think about. Not to stereotype, but in my dealings with it, it's been true.

955
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
They don't have time to figure out how to hook it up.

956
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:28,000
They don't have all this. They want it to fucking work. That's it.

957
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
And so now maybe you're recognizing, if you're targeting casual games especially,

958
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:39,000
even though the thing might be capable of doing all this other stuff you're talking about with the more geometry wars and so forth,

959
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:47,000
maybe the push is to grandma who enjoys Farmville now maybe wants apples to apples on her TV.

960
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Or whatever else Microsoft might reveal in the next year game-wise.

961
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
I gotta be honest though. If you're saying that that's the reason that people would buy these TVs,

962
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I don't think those type of people would buy a web-enabled TV or anything like that.

963
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Because it's too complicated for them.

964
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Why spend the money to get this really expensive TV with a console built into it, like a gaming console,

965
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:16,000
that first off is gonna use these really complicated controllers that grandma's not gonna have any idea how to fucking navigate.

966
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Well, because it won't just be a gaming console. It'll play the casual games.

967
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
But it's gonna have all of Microsoft's other stuff too.

968
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:31,000
It'll have all those channels with the built-in Hulu and the Netflix and all that same shit.

969
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I just don't think they're gonna do that. The only reason I don't think they're gonna do that is because other people have done it better already.

970
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
And there's no reason to-

971
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Why wouldn't they want a piece of it then?

972
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Why wouldn't they want a piece of it? Because I don't think that they-

973
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Has that worked out well for them in the whole mobile phone department?

974
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Have they really taken a large chunk of the business from Android and iOS?

975
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Nope.

976
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
When does that ever stop Microsoft from trying?

977
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Well, I think that they're definitely not trying as hard with Windows Phone 8 and stuff.

978
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
I mean, it's probably selling alright, but I don't hear people going,

979
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Oh, I need a Windows Phone 8. It's more like, I need an iPhone 5.

980
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Or I need the next spiffy Android phone that's gonna come out.

981
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I just don't-

982
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Yeah, it's a possibility that they'll come out with something like this to try to get people in,

983
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
but I mean, I don't know why you would do it.

984
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:32,000
But let's just say that, you know, there are people that will buy things that don't make sense.

985
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
So, why not?

986
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Why not?

987
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Alright, well let me move on with some more news,

988
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:44,000
and this is about some things that have gone on in the Wii U front since the console launch.

989
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Some folks talking about a Miiverse hack, and that Miiverse was hacked and all this.

990
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
That's not really what happened.

991
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Somebody on NeoGaf said that they were screwing around with Miiverse,

992
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,000
and they were able to get into the debug and admin options of Miiverse.

993
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
Sounds like that wasn't really what it is, at least that's what Nintendo's claiming.

994
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Nintendo's saying it was a prototype that Nintendo did send out a statement to gamesindustry.biz

995
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
saying that what the user found was a mock-up menu.

996
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
It's no longer there. It's inaccessible.

997
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:25,000
And that could be believable enough, especially if MiU at its core is basically running off a web protocol,

998
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
which is certainly possible.

999
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,000
I think that's absolutely possible. The whole damn thing is running off a web-type based protocol,

1000
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
and we just kind of don't see it.

1001
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Why not?

1002
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
I hope that's not the case.

1003
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
It's probably very easy.

1004
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
So, whatever. I mean, I'm spouting like I know what I'm talking about,

1005
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:45,000
but it probably wasn't hard to find something like this in there,

1006
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
and I don't think it's very serious, especially if it was a mock-up.

1007
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I mean, even just kind of looking at all the information on the screen, I don't think it's a big deal.

1008
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Anyway, if you want to know the full statement, quote,

1009
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,000
It has come to our attention that some of the people were able to access a mock-up menu on Miiverse

1010
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
following the launch of Wii U in the U.S.

1011
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Please note that this is only a mock-up menu and has now been removed and is not accessible.

1012
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Remember how we were talking about those doors that you open up and just, wham, you run into a wall?

1013
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Yeah, there's another one of those trapdoors right there.

1014
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Someone stumbled.

1015
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,000
One other bit on the Wii U. I actually, you know, you've got to give Nintendo credit for this.

1016
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:28,000
This is a comment from Frozenbyte who made Trine 2, which is one of the download titles available on Wii U.

1017
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,000
You may not know this because it hasn't been talked about as much as the launch game,

1018
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
but there are like five download-only games available on the Wii U.

1019
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I'm not talking about the retail land, but I'm talking about like $15 download games available on Wii U right now.

1020
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,000
I personally have not tried any yet, but they're available. I've had friends that talk about it.

1021
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Do they have demos?

1022
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Not now, no.

1023
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Wow, Nintendo way to be in the forefront of, you know, digital content. Fuck, you know what?

1024
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Again, I'm gonna get...

1025
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
PlayStation 1 had demos, I mean...

1026
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Well, but the Wii has demos, so again, I'm gonna say, was it ready to go by November 18th?

1027
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Look for it in December and January. That's the way it's gonna be.

1028
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,000
It'll happen. It just wasn't ready November 18th.

1029
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,000
But, okay, so they may not have demos, whatever, but let me get to this, because I do think this is worth mentioning.

1030
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
So, Frozenbyte, they made Trine 2, which is probably one of the more visible titles that's there.

1031
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:25,000
A quote from Mikael Haveri, who's the marketing manager, quote,

1032
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:32,000
We have the power to price our products as we please, with just some basic guidelines from the big guys.

1033
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:38,000
The step to this is purely from Nintendo's side, and they can clearly see that their previous installments have not been up to par.

1034
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:44,000
We can set our own pricing, and actually continuing on that by setting our own sales whenever we want.

1035
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:50,000
It is very close to what Apple and Steam are doing at the moment, and very indie-friendly.

1036
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:58,000
So, in other words, Nintendo's tried to fix some of this and make the DLC part of the, or the, you know,

1037
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,000
download distribution component of the Wii U a little bit lucrative.

1038
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Free patches! You can do patching all you want for free.

1039
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Considering we've heard the bitches from folks who make the Xbox Live Arcade games complain about the pricing of the patching over there,

1040
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
that suddenly makes this very lucrative. Being able to put your own game on sale when you want and all that,

1041
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,000
that's going to make this a lot more attractive.

1042
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:28,000
It will be interesting to see if, you know, if it actually leads to the games being made, because that's what it's really about.

1043
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:33,000
If that happens, though, if there will be any response from Microsoft and Sony.

1044
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:37,000
But you've got to admit, Nintendo's doing the right thing there.

1045
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Yeah.

1046
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,000
So, very interesting.

1047
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
It makes good sense.

1048
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Yep. They've told us there are no basic payments for each patch, and we can update our game almost as much as we want.

1049
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,000
For indie developers, this is huge.

1050
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I wonder if that might be a lure for Minecraft. Who knows?

1051
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Who knows? I like to just throw making up stuff out there.

1052
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:06,000
SSJ100Matt in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com wanted to bring this up about the demos.

1053
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Wii U has kiosk demos. I'm sure it will happen soon.

1054
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Jason wants to point out, Loki, iOS doesn't have demos.

1055
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
That's not true.

1056
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
That's not true either.

1057
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,000
It's up to the developer.

1058
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,000
There's light versions.

1059
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Yeah, there's that whole light thing that they do, and now the whole in-app purchases.

1060
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:33,000
You don't think about it because it's different than how Xbox and PlayStation does demos, but developers found a way to do it.

1061
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:38,000
It'll be interesting to see how that plays out on Wii U if it does.

1062
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
All right, moving on with more news. DarkSakura.

1063
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Oh, wait. I was going to add one last thing.

1064
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Yeah, go ahead.

1065
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
There is actually some Wii hacks that actually happened.

1066
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Oh.

1067
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Legit stuff that it's not necessarily the Wii U, but it's run in the Wii U.

1068
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
I fucking hate how they have this.

1069
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:01,000
The Wii Channel on the Wii U, because that makes all the sense in the world.

1070
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I will say, I might be the only person who didn't transfer their Wii stuff over.

1071
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Like, I don't see the benefit of doing that right now.

1072
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Can a chatter sway me that I'm wrong on that?

1073
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Why would I want to do that?

1074
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I don't know.

1075
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:24,000
There's a loader that was available for the Wii using Super Smash Bros. Brawl called Stack Smash.

1076
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:34,000
What it basically does is it uses a modified, I want to say a modified Brawl stage save file to run unsigned code.

1077
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:38,000
That exploit still works on the Wii U.

1078
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:44,000
So you can actually run Wii Homebrew through the Wii Channel on the Wii U.

1079
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:49,000
There was a game that was played in one of the videos I saw here.

1080
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Also, they were saying that basically not everything works.

1081
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,000
You can't use the hacks to create the Homebrew Channel and stuff like that.

1082
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:09,000
They're saying right now, nothing that requires Hack Mii uses the current kernel exploits or uses AHB prot will work.

1083
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:14,000
It says that includes Devolution, USB Loader, CIOS installers, and Wii Linux.

1084
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:19,000
But it says Nintendo cannot patch Stack Smash using their current architecture.

1085
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,000
While it's technically possible, it would require a lot of work on their part.

1086
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,000
It could result in Super Smash Bros. Brawl being unstable for all users.

1087
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Plus, it's most likely they knew that it would work before the guy posted the video.

1088
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,000
So in other words, hackers gonna hack.

1089
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:39,000
They're looking frantically for a way in that device.

1090
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,000
The clock is running. How fast can they find the way into the Wii U?

1091
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
They already have found kind of a way in.

1092
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Yeah, they found a kind of way in and they've also...

1093
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:55,000
There was a video here that I guess they're dumping the console keys from the Wii mode stuff.

1094
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:00,000
I don't really know what exactly they would use with that, but still interesting I guess.

1095
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:05,000
Interesting to note though, Nintendo is kind of doing something where, you know...

1096
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
Well, I guess Microsoft kind of does this too whenever you connect to Live.

1097
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Is that it's gonna automatically download firmware.

1098
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
I mean, it'll download it overnight when it's not on and all that.

1099
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:17,000
So it's kind of like more how PlayStation Plus kind of does it.

1100
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
In theory, I mean, we haven't seen it happen first hand yet.

1101
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Because there's only been the one patch which most people do when you first turn on the system.

1102
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,000
But in theory, this is gonna download things when you're asleep and they'll be there ready to install.

1103
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
We'll see how that plays out.

1104
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
Wasn't that what they were supposed to be doing at the Wii?

1105
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I remember that you were supposed to leave it on and, you know...

1106
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,000
It would download stuff and you'd have that little ring light flashing.

1107
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Which I really wish they had the ring light stuff on there.

1108
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
There were the messages.

1109
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,000
It's now the home button on the pad is a blue light.

1110
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
And whenever friends sign on and off, that little light lights up.

1111
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Yeah, that's just not as sexy as it was on the Wii.

1112
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,000
It's not, but I just want to point out it's sort of there.

1113
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Sort of there.

1114
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Alright, now we'll move on to Dark Sakura and what she was gonna talk about.

1115
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Yeah, I just started crocheting again too.

1116
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Well, going back to some kind of old news.

1117
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
We all know what the R4 cartridge is, right?

1118
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,000
It is the little...

1119
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
No, I don't know. Please educate me.

1120
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
The R4, it's a flash cartridge that works on the DS.

1121
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,000
You can use homebrew or pirated games on the system.

1122
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,000
And there's also ones called like...

1123
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I had a Ninja Pass was one that I had that doesn't work anymore.

1124
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:38,000
But now Nintendo has really got a push on and got it with the Japanese government.

1125
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
That the R4 is now illegal to sell in Japan.

1126
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Actually, it's completely banned by the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.

1127
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:55,000
It was illegal to sell since 2009, but importing it is completely illegal now.

1128
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:03,000
As far as other places that it's been banned, it's now banned in France and the UK.

1129
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Amazon and eBay are no longer allowing this cartridge to be sold.

1130
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:16,000
And different Australian distributors have been successfully sued by Nintendo.

1131
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:24,000
I'm assuming it's still pretty available in the age-old venue of discreet brown paper bags in lavatories.

1132
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Probably, yeah.

1133
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
I mean, if I wanted one, I could go get one.

1134
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
There's ways to get it. You can order them online.

1135
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:36,000
But it's now specifically illegal to import them in Japan.

1136
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:41,000
Not just sell them like it was the rule. You can't import it.

1137
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
I mean, you could, but you could go to jail.

1138
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Or have them stare at you sternly and force you to kill yourself.

1139
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Well, probably a lot of it has to do with how out there you're being too.

1140
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Because in Australia, I think it wasn't illegal to import the M-rated games because they had been banned in Australia.

1141
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Like, I remember Mortal Kombat and the new one.

1142
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Like, isn't it illegal to send that?

1143
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:09,000
I mean, now maybe it's not because of the whole new rating board, but before it was illegal to send a copy over there.

1144
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,000
But, like, how are they really going to find each and every person that does it?

1145
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Not that I'm encouraging it.

1146
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
I think we all know why the R4 cart is being banned.

1147
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Although...

1148
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
You can still buy them, of course.

1149
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Of course you can.

1150
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:35,000
We remember the beginning of 2010, there was that UK guy who went to jail for a year for importing 26,000 games to set up with an R4.

1151
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,000
There's a difference between 26,000 games and me going on Craigslist.

1152
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Yeah. Well, regardless, if people want something badly enough, they're going to find a way to make it happen.

1153
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:53,000
It's just that now it's officially a punishable crime. The end.

1154
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
And Nintendo just wants to put more hurdles up.

1155
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,000
They want to make it harder.

1156
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Well, they want to protect their product.

1157
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
They're certainly well within their rights to do it.

1158
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
I get it.

1159
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:12,000
I mean, if you think about it, and I hate to say this, it was how easily replicated games were for Dreamcast that contributed to the Dreamcast failure.

1160
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Nintendo's already sitting kind of in a precarious position.

1161
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Right.

1162
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
So, of course they're going to want to protect their investment.

1163
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Which is a bummer because, you know, the homebrew element of it, you want to embrace, you want to be able to say, like, yeah, people should be able to run homebrew on it, but...

1164
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Unfortunately, 95% of the people I pulled that number completely out of my ass aren't really using it for...

1165
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Well, they're using it for homebrew and other things, you know.

1166
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
See, I wanted to play fan translations.

1167
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
But, you know, it's not in the cards.

1168
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Although technically that's illegal too, if you think about it.

1169
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Yeah, well, they can bite my ass.

1170
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Yeah, I know that that's always, like, I'm always feel like that too.

1171
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
And I've talked about this on the show.

1172
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,000
That's when I feel justified in piracy, like, and I know that's a controversial opinion.

1173
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I know you may not agree with me there and what have you.

1174
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:08,000
But like, if a company just isn't going to do it, then let me just freaking get the translation version or, you know, let me get it from the other country.

1175
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
You know, I went off on this casino blade.

1176
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:16,000
You know, it's people who really like a series that's going to put that fun and, you know, that effort into it.

1177
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:22,000
You know, and it really should actually more send a signal to the companies that fans want this.

1178
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I mean, like, what happened with, um...

1179
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Crap, what was that game that was on the Wii?

1180
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Xenoblade.

1181
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Xenoblade, yeah.

1182
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Of course people wanted Xenoblade.

1183
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
And it was already, you know, in English.

1184
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,000
But no one knew it and then they did it because, you know, they realized, hey, it's stupid.

1185
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
People do want it, you know.

1186
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Apparently Last Story is doing...

1187
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
It's not like, oh my gosh, take off, amazing.

1188
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,000
But it's one... I think it's like XSeed's biggest selling title.

1189
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Yeah.

1190
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Is the Last Story.

1191
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
So I really wanted to play that.

1192
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:58,000
And some people are saying it's not a bad thing because right now you can get it for 20 bucks most places.

1193
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:06,000
It's not a bad thing to pick up with a Wii U because it's kind of like, hey, has your Wii been collecting dust for three years but you're picking up a Wii U anyway?

1194
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Here's a Wii game you might have missed.

1195
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Smart strategy.

1196
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Very smart strategy.

1197
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Frisbee seems to agree with us in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

1198
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:21,000
If you don't sell a product to a country, they can't complain about lost sales due to downloading.

1199
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
I know that's a controversial opinion. I know it stinks.

1200
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,000
But I'm kind of like, you know what?

1201
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
It's technically right.

1202
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:31,000
The internet puts us in a more global community than companies want to sometimes acknowledge.

1203
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
And that's just the reality.

1204
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,000
And if you feel so bad about it, why don't you freaking import it?

1205
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Import fees are so freaking expensive though.

1206
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
And then region locking and all that crap.

1207
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Where's my disaster day in crisis?

1208
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
There was another game that was in English.

1209
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Alright, let's move on with more news.

1210
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
So Sony's credit rating is kind of crap.

1211
01:02:54,000 --> 01:03:00,000
You know, they're probably going to have to go to one of those credit agencies that they advertise on TV.

1212
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
But not really.

1213
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:12,000
So apparently one of the credit rating boards, I guess, out there, agencies, Fitch Ratings has rated them junk status.

1214
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Also, there was another company, I guess, Moody's, who I've never heard of.

1215
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
I haven't heard either one of them.

1216
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:22,000
They've dropped theirs to, I guess, one notch above junk.

1217
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:27,000
So I guess it would be some people.

1218
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Some may call this junk, but I call them treasures, I guess.

1219
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
That level.

1220
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:45,000
They said the downgrade reflects Fitch's belief that the meaningful recovery will be slow given the company's loss of technology, leadership, and key products.

1221
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:50,000
High competition, weak economic conditions in developed markets, and the strong yen.

1222
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
So, yeah.

1223
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,000
So it's a company saying that they're going to fail.

1224
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:01,000
And I guess we just wait for them to either do so or not.

1225
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Am I correct, though?

1226
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:09,000
I mean, I'm not up and up on all my financial world stuff, but I believe this doesn't mean Sony is failing.

1227
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:15,000
It means that the analysts believe it's going to tank because they see the downward trend.

1228
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Yeah, it's basically saying, hey, banks that are lending Sony money, they're at more risk on, you know, not being able to pay those loans back, even though they're a big company.

1229
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Big companies file bankruptcy all the time.

1230
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
So just Twinkies.

1231
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Yeah, the hostess company.

1232
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
I mean, so.

1233
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Yeah, but also how many of Sony's CEOs are giving themselves raises every four months?

1234
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Well, I don't know, but also you're talking about more of a global company than hostess was.

1235
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Sony's based in Japan. It's very different culture there.

1236
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
True.

1237
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:54,000
But I mean, it's still if they have sound business practices and deal ethically, then I think that they can turn around.

1238
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,000
What happened with hostess was a pure bout of greed and poor regulation.

1239
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,000
Well, one thing with Sony is that they're more than games, too.

1240
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,000
We have to remember there's a whole lot of other facets of Sony.

1241
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:12,000
And even though their games may be doing OK, although I think people wish the PlayStation three were doing better, especially the Vita.

1242
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
It sounds like they're not doing well.

1243
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Well, I think that they weren't doing well.

1244
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:22,000
And just like some of the other fields, like, for example, Sony phones are Ericsson's not really a big thing anymore.

1245
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
TVs.

1246
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Everybody goes off brand and gets the Black Friday 200 dollar TV.

1247
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:33,000
However, Toshiba and Panasonic and Samsung have really pushed in LG, especially.

1248
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Those brands have really surpassed Sony in quality, though.

1249
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:42,000
And I don't think people are buying cameras as much anymore because now the cameras and camera phones are all right.

1250
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
I mean, they're, you know, multi megapixel cameras.

1251
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,000
And for a lot of people, that's just enough.

1252
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,000
They don't need anything dedicated to just a camera unless you're actually really in the photography.

1253
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Well, I'll tell you this.

1254
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:59,000
My iPhone camera is tons better than the digital rebel that my husband has bought four years ago.

1255
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Dungeon Buster in our chat room.

1256
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,000
Sony has a lot of internal issues that contributed to their failure.

1257
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
They have had a lot of shifting and things going on lately.

1258
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Bob Coffee says the strong yen is what's fucking Japanese companies bad.

1259
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,000
That exchange rate.

1260
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Dungeon Buster also clarifies his earlier comment saying all of their competitors hired who they tried to force into early retirement.

1261
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
Hmm.

1262
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,000
So, yeah, we have to remember Sony is more than just games.

1263
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,000
But it's not like their games are performing, especially the Vita.

1264
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,000
I mean, that that's not looking pretty for Sony right now.

1265
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Another thing, too, is that companies in Japan don't have those the rules regarding single types of products to like,

1266
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:46,000
for example, Toyota also makes housing house housing siding.

1267
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Takara, you know, makes toys and wine.

1268
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:54,000
You know, it's the companies are allowed to branch out into other areas and expand.

1269
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:00,000
I mean, how else I think could Nintendo go from a card company to a, you know.

1270
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:06,000
A computer entertainment company. But I think the point is, though, is that first of all,

1271
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
I agree with the comment regarding the strength of the yen,

1272
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:15,000
especially when you're dealing on an international market with other economies that you're relying on that don't have as strong

1273
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Fundage, then, yeah, you're going to run into a lot of problems on the exchange as well.

1274
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Since I brought up the Vita, I do want to remind people, if you've been neglecting your Vita,

1275
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,000
PlayStation Plus just came out on the Vita and there was a 2.0 patch for everybody.

1276
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,000
So just, you know, go turn on your Vita if you haven't in a while.

1277
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I didn't play enough of this game to really review it this week.

1278
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:38,000
I'll talk about it next week. But my early impressions of Gravity Rush,

1279
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,000
which is one of the free games on Plus right now.

1280
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Neat. I'm really liking what I see. It's like one of these games I'm like,

1281
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,000
I think people totally missed this. I mean, I know it has its fans.

1282
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I've heard some people talking about it on Twitter and so forth.

1283
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,000
But like, more people should be talking about Gravity Rush.

1284
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
It's pretty great from what I've played of it so far.

1285
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
And that's a free one on PlayStation Plus and the Uncharted game, of course.

1286
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
And Wipeout. Wipeout is supposed to be one of the best.

1287
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
It was one of the best looking games at launch.

1288
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,000
And Tactics PSP, which, you know, some of you might not have even bothered to pick up or whatever.

1289
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,000
It's free. So PlayStation Plus on Vita, looking nice right now.

1290
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
So if you have a Vita and you happen to have PlayStation Plus,

1291
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
I would really urge you to go check that free shit out.

1292
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Even if you don't want to, the 2.0 upgrade allows the wireless transmissions,

1293
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
which is one of those duh, this thing should have been there in the beginning.

1294
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:29,000
And all those features, which is great. So there you go.

1295
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:34,000
And ShadowNextGen does want to say in chat, actually PlayStation is losing Sony money right now.

1296
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
The Vita has hurt them a lot. Yeah, I mentioned the Vita earlier.

1297
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:43,000
And I just, the sales in Japan and the US and everywhere really don't look good.

1298
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:48,000
I think their opportunity with some of these games, I think was it,

1299
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:53,000
the company that worked on Resistance and did the Call of Duty PS Vita versions.

1300
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:56,000
That was bad. They hurt them bad.

1301
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Because Resistance is a great first person shooter franchise from Sony.

1302
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,000
And it just, it sucked on the Vita.

1303
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:08,000
And then, come to find out, and I was just very cautious,

1304
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,000
I was like, ooh, black ops on the Vita, that's going to be awesome.

1305
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Then I saw what I was making, I was like, oh, wait a second.

1306
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Maybe I'll wait until the reviews come out. And sure enough, total crap.

1307
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Yeah, it's like, what happened to that, what was it?

1308
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Was it Game Developers Conference or one of those other,

1309
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,000
where Sony just came out and said, we've got over 100 games coming to the Vita.

1310
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,000
Where are they? What happened?

1311
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Final Fantasy X, we're going to remake that. When?

1312
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
I don't know.

1313
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,000
Uh-oh, are people abandoning ship? What's happening?

1314
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:52,000
So, yeah, that's what I'm worried about, is that as the Vita kind of continues to not perform so well,

1315
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
those parties are going to get off that sinking ship.

1316
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
You know what's going to really help it?

1317
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,000
In February, when Defense Force 2017 portable comes out.

1318
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Yeah, there you go. Keep on hoping. Keep on hoping.

1319
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:06,000
All right, let me move on here. I want to talk about this.

1320
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,000
I noticed when I was playing Curiosity this week, well, you don't really play Curiosity.

1321
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Yeah, I tried playing that while waiting for my car to be looked at,

1322
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:18,000
because I took it to a dealership, just to say, hey, is there anything wrong with this?

1323
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Can you take a look at it, just to see if there's anything wrong with the car?

1324
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Wasn't anything, which is good.

1325
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:29,000
But, yeah, I tried playing that, and it's like, oh, hey, cool, it's not updating. Awesome.

1326
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:36,000
It works all right for me, and it's more like, again, I think I called it bubble wrap on last week's show,

1327
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,000
and that's pretty much what it is. There's not really a game there. It's just tap, tap, tap.

1328
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:47,000
You can do combos. Come on. It's pressing squares to make them disappear. It's not rocket science.

1329
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:56,000
I was very intrigued that one of the layers on the Cube this week was an ad for a Kickstarter called Godus,

1330
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:03,000
or not like Godus, like a female god, but like Godus, G-O-D-U-S, Godus.

1331
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Not really. It's Godus, which is supposed to be a reinvention of Populous.

1332
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:15,000
I thought, actually, I got to be honest, as much as I think Curiosity is interesting and all,

1333
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:19,000
that was tacky as shit, having that Kickstarter in there.

1334
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:25,000
I wouldn't put it past Molyneux, though. The more I was thinking about it, I was like,

1335
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:31,000
that is so a thing for him to do. But, anyway, I just found that tacky as shit.

1336
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:37,000
But, regardless, I think it's neat that he's revisiting the Populous idea,

1337
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,000
because I think that game in particular was a great game.

1338
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:47,000
So, that is something that he started a Kickstarter for. It's available on, of course, Kickstarter.

1339
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:57,000
They want 450,000 pounds to do the Rebirth of God games for PC, iOS, and Android.

1340
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:03,000
And, you know, you can look at more details on the Kickstarter if you want about what all you can get from it.

1341
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:07,000
But that is on his plate for games he wants to do.

1342
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,000
I thought the 22 Cans had these other games lined up. Like, I remember reading about one.

1343
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,000
I thought the next game was supposed to be Cooperation or something was supposed to be the next game for 22 Cans.

1344
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,000
So, I don't know where this fits into it, if this is, like, an actual 22.

1345
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:25,000
Because, remember, 22 Cans is because Molyneux's got 22 ideas for iOS games.

1346
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:33,000
Whatever. I don't know where this fits into it. I don't know if this is one of the 22 or if this is, like, a bonus or what.

1347
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,000
I hope it's as good as Populous. I guess that's all I can say.

1348
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
I'm not giving him any money. No.

1349
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:48,000
I just, I was kind of turned off by the ad in Curiosity. Like, I don't, I can't explain it. Like, it just, it was tacky.

1350
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:55,000
I don't know. It turned me off to Curiosity, too. Is that what we're tapping away at? The big mystery in advertisement?

1351
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Hmm.

1352
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Alright, let's move on. Dark Sakura.

1353
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,000
My computer just did something bizarre. Hold on. There we go.

1354
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:18,000
So, as was teased earlier when we talked to Bobby, there's a game that I'm super excited about that's coming out on the 3DS through the Nintendo eShop.

1355
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:24,000
And that is Space Harrier! Yay!

1356
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Mind you, it's not, like, I think the Sega Ages one. It's a currently redone 3D version of Space Harrier.

1357
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,000
So I'm pretty excited about that because it's one of my favorite games ever.

1358
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:52,000
And I'd actually, I think I've put it as, like, number three on my top games list. Like, number one being The Guardian Legend, number two being Fantasy Zone, and number three being Space Harrier.

1359
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,000
So, welcome to the Fantasy Zone. Get ready.

1360
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Now you gotta get a 3DS.

1361
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:05,000
You wanna know what's funny, Rob? I have about seven versions of Space Harrier at home.

1362
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Tell me you don't want this one.

1363
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,000
I actually do have a 3D version of this game.

1364
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,000
But you don't want the fancy new one? You don't want the 2012 or 2013 version?

1365
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,000
But keep in mind, the 3DS does give me headaches.

1366
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
You don't have to play in 3D mode.

1367
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Then I could just play my Sega Ages one.

1368
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,000
One of my Sega Ages ones.

1369
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Alright, let's move on and travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out a little sooner than Space Harrier 3DS.

1370
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:39,000
With release dates, I don't know if it's slowing down now or what's happening, but Loki, tell us about release dates.

1371
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Yeah, it's quite slowed down now.

1372
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Not a whole ton coming out this week. In fact, pretty much just a couple things.

1373
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:52,000
You've got the American Mensa Academy on the 3DS.

1374
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Ratchet and Clank Full Frontal Assault on PS3.

1375
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Kids learn and play Pets and Vets on the DS and...

1376
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,000
I think that actually might be it.

1377
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Oh, Scribblenauts Unlimited on PC.

1378
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
I guess that wasn't ready to go yet.

1379
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Alright, well, traveling to Japan, since it's a little different over there and they didn't really have Black Friday.

1380
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,000
You still have some games coming out in Japan.

1381
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Darkciders 2 comes out, as well as Love Tor.

1382
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Love Torre, probably. Mint version in limited and regular editions.

1383
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,000
And this is a sequel to Sweet.

1384
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,000
For a moment, I thought you said Toire.

1385
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
Which means toilet.

1386
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Love Toilet?

1387
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Yeah.

1388
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
No, I don't think these girls are having fun in Love Toire.

1389
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,000
That's what it says. Toire.

1390
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Toire.

1391
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Let's see. Let me read the little description for this.

1392
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Hold on. Go away, box art. Go back to the description here.

1393
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,000
I think I would play a game called Love Toilet.

1394
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Box description.

1395
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
It's already been brought in.

1396
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,000
Box description.

1397
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Gigantic, soulless eyes.

1398
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Kinda.

1399
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Alright, let's move on to the PlayStation 3.

1400
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,000
On the PlayStation 3, Darkciders 2 is there as well.

1401
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:41,000
As well as Power Smash 4 going into the Sega The Best collection.

1402
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Shin Sangoku Musou Online, Ryujin Orambu 5th Anniversary Pack.

1403
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,000
That's probably just a repackaging of Shin Sangoku.

1404
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Sports Champions 2 makes its way to Japan on the 29th as well.

1405
01:16:54,000 --> 01:17:02,000
And Dai 2G Super Robot Taisen Original Generations in the regular and Blu-ray disc box.

1406
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
So that's probably one of them combo packs.

1407
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Looking at the PlayStation Vita this week.

1408
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Fate Stay Night, Power Smash 4.

1409
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
Price reduction there as well.

1410
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,000
And Samurai and Dragons, Ryuzoku Kurin.

1411
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:26,000
As well as a new game called Totori no Atlier Plus Arland no Renken Jutsuji 2 comes out over there as well.

1412
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Sorry to interrupt, but is Samurai and Dragons pretty much their version of Cowboys and Aliens?

1413
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
It very well might be, I don't know.

1414
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:38,000
I've heard these Atlier games though. There's one of them on PlayStation 3 out here.

1415
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
There's a few out on PlayStation 3 out here.

1416
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Look at these two.

1417
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:45,000
I don't think these two chicks who are embracing in this picture are wearing a top.

1418
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Just pointing out.

1419
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Or legal.

1420
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Or legal.

1421
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Just saying.

1422
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,000
They're embracing in a bath house, I'm sure.

1423
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
The graphics look pretty though outside of that picture.

1424
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Very cel shading and all that.

1425
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Let's see, Totori brings her tools, her books, and everything colorful to the PS Vita.

1426
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Forget about saving the world, you have more important business to attend to.

1427
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Namely, collecting your ingredients, learning new recipes, creating powerful items, and completing missions set by the guild.

1428
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:16,000
In this game where you have a schedule to follow, every moment counts.

1429
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,000
The PS Vita game includes new modes and upgrades.

1430
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:24,000
People who adore Totori's motherly elder sister, Cici, can include her in the playing team right away.

1431
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
There's also new enhancements and contents exclusive to the PS Vita version.

1432
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
So maybe this is like a redo of that PS3 game.

1433
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Bob Coffee actually went back and made a comment about the love tote.

1434
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Yeah.

1435
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:39,000
You got served cross bring it on equals moe moe pawa.

1436
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:45,000
On the Wii U in Japan, not yet. December 8th is the big day.

1437
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,000
So we got another week to go before we talk about Wii U in Japan.

1438
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:54,000
But we can talk about the Nintendo 3DS and Naruto SD Powerful Shippuden.

1439
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
Because what would the week be without a Naruto game?

1440
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Also, Layton Kaiju vs. Gaikuten Saiban comes out from level 5.

1441
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Oh hell yeah.

1442
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Yes! That needs to hurry up and come out over here so quickly.

1443
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,000
You know who that is, right?

1444
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,000
That's Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright.

1445
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Phoenix Wright. Hell yeah.

1446
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
I didn't even, like I heard this.

1447
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Didn't you see the trailer?

1448
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,000
I thought this was a thing like in development.

1449
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
I didn't realize this was like coming out in Japan now.

1450
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Yeah.

1451
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Did you watch the trailer for this?

1452
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
I think I did a long time ago now that you talked about it.

1453
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Pretty epic.

1454
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
Really?

1455
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:29,000
It's pretty cool.

1456
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Sort of semi off topic.

1457
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
There's now a Phoenix Wright movie.

1458
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

1459
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Yes.

1460
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Hopefully something will get here a little easier to obtain.

1461
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Oh yes.

1462
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Well I guess the internet's not much easier than that but you know.

1463
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Alright, that's going to do it for Japanese releases.

1464
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Let's go over to the UK, Dark Sakura.

1465
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
On the 26th we have LEGO Lord of the Rings.

1466
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:54,000
On the 27th we have Battlefield 3 Aftermath and Mass Effect 3 Omega.

1467
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:58,000
I'm glad that like for DLC it gets its own release date.

1468
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
That just makes me so happy.

1469
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Because they respect Mass Effect.

1470
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:11,000
On the 20th of November Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition, Miasmada on PC and Stealth Bastard Deluxe.

1471
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
That's the best name.

1472
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
Stealth Bastard.

1473
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Or maybe it would be Stealth Busted.

1474
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,000
You know, Eddie Iser just to be believed.

1475
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,000
On the 29th, Arrow Porter on 3DS.

1476
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:31,000
The 30th, Ben 10 Omniverse, Epic Mickey 2, The Power of 2, Far Cry 3, FIFA 13, Little Inferno, Warriors of Roshi 3 Hyper.

1477
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
The Wii U.

1478
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:36,000
The Zone of the Enders HD Collection.

1479
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:43,000
And let me see what I've got for, if there's anything on December 1st, hold on.

1480
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:46,000
God, I can't believe it's already almost December.

1481
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,000
No, nothing until the 4th.

1482
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.

1483
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
But first, Loki.

1484
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Yes.

1485
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,000
So let's talk a little bit about Telltale Games.

1486
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:06,000
And thankfully it's not about them closing down, but actually they're expanding starting spring 2013.

1487
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:11,000
And what they're going to do is, I guess, they're moving out of their current office.

1488
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:16,000
They're going to, I guess, get an office that's almost twice as big.

1489
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:26,000
And right now they're looking to up their staff by, it looks like, 35 people starting in March and April of 2013.

1490
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:30,000
And I guess that's good news that they're doing well.

1491
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
So they've got, of course, a lot of games out right now.

1492
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:35,000
They just finished up the second season of Walking Dead.

1493
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,000
Or I guess, yeah, they're working on the second season of Walking Dead.

1494
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:47,000
The first season just finished and actually should be coming out on a disc retail version two weeks from now.

1495
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:51,000
So, pretty cool.

1496
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
I agree with Bobby.

1497
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:57,000
I hear great things about the Walking Dead.

1498
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
I have heard so much good stuff about that.

1499
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:03,000
A lot of people saying that's the game of the year right there is the Walking Dead.

1500
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
I just haven't had a chance to play it.

1501
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
There's so much stuff going on right now.

1502
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
There's, you know, a new game every day.

1503
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,000
But I want to take the time to sit down and play the Walking Dead at some point.

1504
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:21,000
I am, some people on Twitter went so far as to say it is the best ending ever in a video game.

1505
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Kira, I don't want to see your spoilers, but I'm very curious.

1506
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
I haven't watched any of the show, so...

1507
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
It's not based on the show. It's based on the books.

1508
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Or the comics or whatever.

1509
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,000
So you don't need to watch the show to understand it.

1510
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
That was made pretty clear when the game first came out.

1511
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
So it's very different.

1512
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:46,000
But obviously, a lot of people who are into the show, which is a very popular show, are into this for similar reasons.

1513
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Regardless, it sounds like it came out better than Jurassic Park.

1514
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
To be fair, I didn't play that either.

1515
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Now that song is stuck in my head.

1516
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
Jurassic Park is frightening in the dark.

1517
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Jurassic Park is frightening in the dark.

1518
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Alright, let's see.

1519
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:06,000
One more on Ubisoft and a comment they made this week about this current console generation.

1520
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Ubisoft doesn't want the next console generation to go quite as long.

1521
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,000
This was in a talk with Polygon.

1522
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,000
I can never say this guy's name right. Sorry in advance.

1523
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:19,000
Yves Guillemot?

1524
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,000
I don't know. It's French, so...

1525
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,000
How would you say that? Right there.

1526
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Wilmot?

1527
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Wilmot?

1528
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Well, that's basically...

1529
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,000
Yves Guillemot!

1530
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:35,000
I think it would be Yves.

1531
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Yeah, he's the CEO at Ubisoft.

1532
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
It's Yves. Haha, I'm French!

1533
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Stop it.

1534
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Alright, he's the CEO at Ubisoft and he said that basically it's kind of taken a while for hardware to come out.

1535
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Quote, we are used to the changing machines every five years.

1536
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:59,000
When a console is out for a long time, you don't take as much risks on totally new IPs because even if they are good, they don't sell as well.

1537
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:03,000
That's kind of an interesting comment because...

1538
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:07,000
Zombie U is an Ubisoft game on the Wii U.

1539
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:12,000
I'm not hearing a lot of good things from critics, but I'm hearing a lot of great things from players.

1540
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:18,000
I obviously will trust the players a little more and I'll trust the critics, but I'm very curious about that game because it seems to be very polarizing.

1541
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
And it's like a new thing.

1542
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,000
A lot of people saying it's like an old Resident Evil game kind of mixed with Dark Souls.

1543
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Which sounds very scary.

1544
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
But yeah.

1545
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:35,000
So, he's basically saying that when a console is out for a long time, you don't want to take risks because they don't sell as well.

1546
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Is that the reason that it feels like this cycle has gone on way too long?

1547
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,000
Or is that the rise of the mobile phone industry? I'm not sure.

1548
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:50,000
I really get bothered though when I keep seeing traditional game companies.

1549
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:57,000
I saw one article somewhere this week that was like, if you're a traditional game company, you're going to be dead in the water if you're not developing for mobile.

1550
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,000
Your thing is dying.

1551
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,000
And I'm just kind of like, no it's not.

1552
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:10,000
I'm like, there's an audience that does, I mean it might not be as big or whatever, but there's definitely an audience that doesn't want that mobile gaming stuff.

1553
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
I can't get what I need on mobile phone.

1554
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,000
The Apple iPhone cannot game the way a console can.

1555
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:20,000
When I get Mass Effect fully on my phone, maybe, but Infiltrator doesn't cut it.

1556
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
No, Infiltrator kind of sucks.

1557
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Like it looks good, but the controls ruin it.

1558
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
I touched it, but eh.

1559
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
The controls ruin it.

1560
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Oh Rob, I touched it.

1561
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:38,000
I don't know, but how can the next console generation be shorter?

1562
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:42,000
They're not going to sell consoles saying, oh well we'll have a new one out in just four years.

1563
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:48,000
They kind of want to encourage people that this next console may have to be the last one they ever buy.

1564
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Although we all know that's not true.

1565
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
I mean you'll still be upgrading your PCs.

1566
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:58,000
But even Alan kind of made a point the other day that even PC upgrades have kind of slowed a little bit.

1567
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Especially now versus maybe where we were at ten years ago.

1568
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:06,000
We've kind of hit this cap.

1569
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
I don't know.

1570
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Alright.

1571
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,000
BlackWolf in our chatroom says, gaming on my TV will never die.

1572
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Amen to that.

1573
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Let's see.

1574
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
ActDeaf talking about the Walking Dead game.

1575
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:24,000
The game is really damn great, though I've only played the first two episodes.

1576
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Duke Nukem wants a Breaking Bad game after the series ends.

1577
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
That's another one I hear a lot about.

1578
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
No thank you, that show is awful.

1579
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
You didn't like it?

1580
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
I fucking hate that show.

1581
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
I also hate Sons of Anarchy.

1582
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
The acting in both are great.

1583
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
I hate the subject matter.

1584
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
I hate how the episodes go.

1585
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:50,000
I hate basically awful, horrible people being put in a positive spotlight.

1586
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
You know.

1587
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Okay yeah, Hitler was an artist, but that doesn't mean I'm a fan.

1588
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Pinning an apartment in one afternoon, two coats.

1589
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
I only have time to watch RuPaul's Drag Race.

1590
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
Alright.

1591
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:12,000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, mouse.

1592
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Let's travel to a time when we didn't even have these mobile phones.

1593
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
They were called car phones, not mobile phones.

1594
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Not even when this was out, I think.

1595
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
You had a brick in the car.

1596
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
16 bits and we liked it.

1597
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:30,000
That's right, you had your gaming in 16 or 8 or whatever bits and you liked it that way.

1598
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:38,000
It's the classic game of the week where Dark Soccer is going to climb into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, play it.

1599
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
It's a little sticky.

1600
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
This one, most of you have probably already played.

1601
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
But if you haven't, you're fucking missing out.

1602
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,000
It was also hopefully chosen by Rachel.

1603
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
The game is Earthbound.

1604
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Yeah, I know. I've done Mother before.

1605
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
I haven't done Mother 2, so shut up.

1606
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Don't judge me.

1607
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
This one was...

1608
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,000
I don't think there's very many people that are going to judge you for doing another Mother game.

1609
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
This series is beloved by a lot of people.

1610
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Yeah, I need to actually break out my copy and play it.

1611
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Yes, I do have this game.

1612
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:16,000
But in Japan, it was Mother 2 Gigu no Gyakushu.

1613
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Which, I don't know what Gyakushu means, so somebody translate for me.

1614
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Oh, I knew that once.

1615
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Probably...

1616
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
...Gig's Revenge.

1617
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Something like that.

1618
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:34,000
At any rate, when it came out with the attract demo, there were two different names.

1619
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:38,000
One was Earthbound, the war against Giygas.

1620
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
And the other one was Mother 2.

1621
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,000
However they've written it, G-Y-I-Y-G, that's a weird way to spell it.

1622
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Strikes Back.

1623
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:52,000
It was designed by Shigesato Itoi.

1624
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:56,000
And it was actually the sequel to Mother.

1625
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
I was going to say, he was the last boss in the game.

1626
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
That's why he's named that.

1627
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Okay.

1628
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Well, no, I know that was his name.

1629
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
I didn't know why they spelled it that way.

1630
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Because it's very weird.

1631
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:16,000
At any rate, the game was released on August 27th, 1994 in Japan.

1632
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:20,000
And in America as Earthbound on June 5th, 1995.

1633
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:24,000
As a standalone, as not a sequel to anything.

1634
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Because we didn't know.

1635
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
We had an import back then, huh?

1636
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
We had Final Fantasy 6 as Final Fantasy 3.

1637
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Come on.

1638
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Yeah.

1639
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000
And then we had our spoon bards.

1640
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Yes.

1641
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
In Final Fantasy 2.4.

1642
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Bouldlerized translations.

1643
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
It's actually evident in a few places in Earthbound.

1644
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:52,000
There's a sequence fairly close to the beginning where they replaced a beating sound with a scolding sound.

1645
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:56,000
And that's your nemesis, basically.

1646
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
He comes home and he gets his ass whooped by his parents.

1647
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Thus launching into the game proper, I think.

1648
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Well, the game did not sell very well.

1649
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
And it was new.

1650
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:16,000
However, everyone loved it because they really liked the satire of American culture.

1651
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:22,000
And the different parodies showing up for the RPG genre.

1652
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,000
It's so quintessentially Japanese.

1653
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
There's just something so unique about it.

1654
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:32,000
You could not have something like Mr. Saturn in an American game.

1655
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
That's true.

1656
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:40,000
I like Mr. Saturn in Smash Brothers because you can hit people with him.

1657
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
Or the cultist. That was my favorite part of the game.

1658
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
Ah, yes.

1659
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
This shit was hilarious.

1660
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Or a boss made out of vomit.

1661
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,000
I do like running around in your pajamas, but in the original, you were naked.

1662
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
Oh, yes.

1663
01:30:54,000 --> 01:31:00,000
It's just such a unique game. That's one of the things that drew me toward it.

1664
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:04,000
They had a sequel planned for the Nintendo 64 double D.

1665
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Which was Earthbound 64.

1666
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:10,000
And it had been in development for a while before it was cancelled.

1667
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:14,000
And then it came out as a GBA game called Mother 3.

1668
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
And it only came out in Japan.

1669
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
However, there are fan translations.

1670
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:22,000
They have a very loose connection to Mother 2.

1671
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
But you can play it on its own.

1672
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
There's actually a few returning characters.

1673
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Yes, and you know, playing the prequel to it does make for a much richer experience.

1674
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
It will punch you in the emotions.

1675
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
I assure you. It'll get you in the feels.

1676
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Yes.

1677
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Now, it actually uses a kind of different sort of projection for playing the game.

1678
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:48,000
It uses what's called oblique projection instead of the top down.

1679
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:54,000
So that you're sort of skewed on a different level with all of the things around it.

1680
01:31:54,000 --> 01:32:02,000
So it gives the world, even though it is purely 2D, it gives it some sort of...

1681
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:06,000
It really makes it seamless as you go from place to place.

1682
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
You know, I think Pokemon uses kind of a similar...

1683
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Pretty similar, yeah, style.

1684
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:16,000
But I really liked its use of the color palette on the SNES.

1685
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Because I thought it was just gorgeous.

1686
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Oh yes, yes.

1687
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
It's not just color, it's how they use it.

1688
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:27,000
But it also doesn't use random encounters like the first Mother game did.

1689
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Oh yeah.

1690
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:32,000
And it is not every three steps like the original Mother.

1691
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
Yes.

1692
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:38,000
So basically, you beat them down to zero.

1693
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:40,000
For their hit points, they get killed.

1694
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:45,000
And if you defeat a specific type of enemy, there's a chance you'll get an item.

1695
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Also, my favorite part about it was the rolling counter.

1696
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:53,000
You could get mortally hit and still finish a fight and live.

1697
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:59,000
So if you gave yourself enough time, especially towards the end when you're upwards of 300 life,

1698
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
that was pretty sweet.

1699
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:07,000
I like how it compares your hit points box to an odometer.

1700
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Oh yeah.

1701
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:16,000
And then of course you had your psi attacks that used your psychic points.

1702
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,000
I guess PK fire.

1703
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:23,000
I heard that way too many times playing Smash Brothers.

1704
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
PK fire! PK fire!

1705
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
It just never goes away.

1706
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:32,000
As far as your weapons go, and yeah, your main character is Ness,

1707
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:36,000
but different weapons were available such as baseball bats, yo-yos, and frying pans.

1708
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Except for one character named Pooh, who can use a sword.

1709
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
But that was only way at the end.

1710
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,000
For most of the game, he's just using his fists.

1711
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
And this is like, what, a 12-year-old?

1712
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Yeah.

1713
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
Give him props for that.

1714
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Well, when you're fighting, vomit.

1715
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:58,000
And miniaturized UFOs, wearing bows, and yes, all sorts of critters.

1716
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
You had all kinds of neat places in the game too.

1717
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:06,000
You had Onett, you know, Toussaint 3 to 4side, you know.

1718
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
They were named.

1719
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:13,000
You also had Winters, Summers, and Dallam, Scaraba, you know,

1720
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
different places that were meant to mimic different areas.

1721
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Highly creative names.

1722
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:23,000
And then you had to, you know, beat the Star Men and everything.

1723
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:27,000
What I really like is looking at the concept art for this game.

1724
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:28,000
Oh, yes.

1725
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
I don't know if you've ever seen any of the concept art for this.

1726
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
It's quite whimsical, and it's just aching and beautiful.

1727
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
It makes me think of a child's storybook.

1728
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Oh, yes, especially I...

1729
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
This would be a fucked up story.

1730
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:42,000
But my favorite was always Dungeon Man, because, you know,

1731
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:45,000
you could see just this like really whimsical turn to it.

1732
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:48,000
And it's also, there's so much detail in it and so much life.

1733
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
It's like, this is such a life affirming game.

1734
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,000
That's one reason I always went back to it.

1735
01:34:55,000 --> 01:35:00,000
There was part of the dialogue for the final battle,

1736
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,000
and this was actually, I was reading,

1737
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:07,000
is this something that I'd read before about the military policemen

1738
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
and the dismembered beauty?

1739
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Yes, and it's not actually a rape scene, as is often misquoted,

1740
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:16,000
but it's a sex scene which turns into a murder scene,

1741
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:21,000
which, you know, is not really a point for splitting money hairs.

1742
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:26,000
But it's always said that it had such an impact on him

1743
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
that he incorporated it into the game.

1744
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
And it works really well.

1745
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
It's very disjointed, and it's kind of horrifying,

1746
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,000
because there's just this sense of out-of-place-ness there

1747
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:37,000
that you don't get in many games.

1748
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
But I like that when they marketed this in Japan,

1749
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:44,000
they actually used a member of SMOP to advertise the game.

1750
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:48,000
They had scratches of stickers that came out with it.

1751
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:51,000
They did all kinds of stuff with weekly Famitsu

1752
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,000
to promote the hell out of this game,

1753
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,000
and of course, sadly, it didn't sell up to expectations.

1754
01:35:56,000 --> 01:36:01,000
But in America, it sold 140,000 copies and twice that many in Japan,

1755
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:03,000
which is still not all that great,

1756
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:06,000
not for how SNES games were selling at the time.

1757
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:11,000
But, you know, it's like many things that are underappreciated when they're new.

1758
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,000
They go back and get that cult status.

1759
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Oh, yes.

1760
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:19,000
And now, you know, it's just considered one of the top games ever.

1761
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:22,000
In 2006, there was a poll in Famitsu,

1762
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,000
and it was rated the 37th best game of all time out of 100.

1763
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:32,000
And it was listed from Gamasutra as one of the top 20 essential Japanese RPGs.

1764
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
I really love this game, for the record,

1765
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
because, you know, and I remember playing this.

1766
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,000
I rented this at least, like, four times from the store and stuff like that,

1767
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
just playing the shit out of it.

1768
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:44,000
One reason I really liked it is that, you know,

1769
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:47,000
I was really into Final Fantasy and all those games on the Super Nintendo,

1770
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
and this was very kind of, it was like that,

1771
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:52,000
but very, like, it wasn't swords and sorcery and stuff.

1772
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
It was just like kids being stupid.

1773
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,000
And I loved that.

1774
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Like, it was very cartoonish,

1775
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:00,000
like the most cartoony thing you could really play on the Super Nintendo at the time,

1776
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,000
but yet it was like this Final Fantasy RPG.

1777
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
That's what I always really loved about it.

1778
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
I really should break out my copy again and play it.

1779
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Good times.

1780
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:13,000
But, yeah, I actually have, I believe this is one of the ones I have in the box still.

1781
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:16,000
I have to admit, I came into this, you know, afterwards.

1782
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
This was not one of the ones we had on the console.

1783
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
I actually completed this on emulator, so, you know,

1784
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,000
sorry if that disqualifies me as a serious gamer, but...

1785
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
I think a lot of people just kind of discovered it that way.

1786
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:29,000
It's really hard to find it for less than 60 bucks.

1787
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Yes, yes.

1788
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
But, you know, at the same time,

1789
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:37,000
I feel, you know, kind of glad that it's, you know, found such popularity on an emulator,

1790
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
because it has reached a much wider audience,

1791
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:44,000
and it does make for a richer experience that you can get it out to different people,

1792
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:48,000
and you find all these little secrets and things you hadn't seen before.

1793
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Did you see the embryos?

1794
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:51,000
You know...

1795
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:52,000
In the very last stage?

1796
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,000
I've seen that, yeah, but you know what?

1797
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
I don't think that is intentional.

1798
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Like, I don't think that's an intentional design thing.

1799
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:02,000
That's a bit like, you know, the backwards tribute to Satan in the Led Zeppelin song.

1800
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,000
It's not...

1801
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Yeah, but I could, but given E-toys history, maybe I could see it happening.

1802
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,000
I just don't know how you didn't actually get that,

1803
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
because it's not just one static image.

1804
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
It's sort of a rolling thing.

1805
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
But it's a repeating. It's a tile.

1806
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
But it's like, it's moving.

1807
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,000
So I don't...

1808
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
I don't know.

1809
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:28,000
I mean, at any rate, for other things that have happened with the series,

1810
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:32,000
of course, it...

1811
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Definitely Ness and other characters have shown up in the Super Smash Bros. series,

1812
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,000
and...

1813
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Well, Ness was a hidden character, but everyone freaking used him.

1814
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:47,000
And Onett was actually a stage in Brawl,

1815
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:51,000
and New Pork City in Mother 3 showed up in Brawl as well,

1816
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
to the rejoice of all who wanted to see it in 3D.

1817
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Yes.

1818
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:59,000
There were also trophies for Paula, Jeff, and Pooh.

1819
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:03,000
And Jeff is an assist trophy in Super Smash Bros. Brawl.

1820
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:09,000
And his multi-bottle rockets were involved as well.

1821
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:13,000
And Mr. Saturn, you could throw him at people, because that was awesome.

1822
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Why was... Mr. Saturn should have been our Pikachu.

1823
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Mr. Saturn, however, you got special...

1824
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:22,000
It was like, you got an achievement for Mr. Saturn-love,

1825
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
or you got points for it,

1826
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:27,000
when you let him wander around the screen and didn't throw him at people.

1827
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
I always thought it was funny.

1828
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,000
And Mr. Saturn only wants to help.

1829
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
You can't help it that he's just a butt on legs.

1830
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,000
With Bo.

1831
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:39,000
Well, at any rate, like I said earlier,

1832
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:42,000
there was supposed to be a sequel in 96 on the 64DD,

1833
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:45,000
but it kept having production problems,

1834
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:48,000
and didn't show at E3 and other gaming conventions.

1835
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,000
So Nintendo cancelled it on August 21st, 2000,

1836
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:54,000
but it resurfaced as a GBA title,

1837
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
and it was only released in Japan.

1838
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:01,000
And also Itoi said he had no more plans to develop the series any further.

1839
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:06,000
There was an ESRB rating that said that it might come out on Wii,

1840
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
but there are still no official plans.

1841
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:13,000
And I want to give further props to the fan translation community,

1842
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:17,000
because in their fight to translate this,

1843
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:21,000
they also found a lot of cool, unused things.

1844
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:24,000
Just sort of artifacts that were left in the data.

1845
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Vomit?

1846
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Yes. Well, unfortunately, no.

1847
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Just things that, you know, unused bosses and unused sprites,

1848
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:36,000
they make you wonder at what was originally planned for this,

1849
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:40,000
because there were a few places that the creator said

1850
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:43,000
he actually had to scale it back a bit because it was frightening him.

1851
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:47,000
I'm, of course, referring to the extended mushroom trip,

1852
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
like sort of halfway through the game.

1853
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:52,000
I actually need to sit down and play E3,

1854
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
because I just haven't had time.

1855
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Well, there's an extended mushroom trip.

1856
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,000
And the final boss.

1857
01:40:57,000 --> 01:40:58,000
I like extended mushroom trips.

1858
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:01,000
The final boss, there is an unused boss battle,

1859
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:04,000
which is, I think it's available on YouTube,

1860
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:10,000
which is deeply unsettling, despite my lack of understanding Japanese.

1861
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:15,000
But as it stands, the Mother 3 game is a very emotionally engaging

1862
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
and rich game, I find.

1863
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:24,000
And it's got its predecessor's balance of horror and just awesomeness.

1864
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Well, this also, I think, is kind of cool.

1865
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:31,000
The sound designer for Earthbound, Keiichi Suzuki,

1866
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:35,000
he actually said that the biggest influence for the music for him

1867
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,000
was John Lennon.

1868
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Excellent.

1869
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
You know, in the YouTube we're watching here,

1870
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
I just saw a reference to the Beatles,

1871
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,000
and it's like one of those funny little jokes, like,

1872
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,000
do you know the name of this Beatles song?

1873
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Blank Blank Blank Turday.

1874
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
And the options are yes and no.

1875
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Like, it's a funny joke because you can say yes.

1876
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
You're right, it's yesterday.

1877
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Anyway.

1878
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
And, you know, music references, sadly,

1879
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:03,000
are one of the reasons they'd have trouble releasing Mother 3 in the U.S.

1880
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:08,000
Because there is the Runaway 5 in Earthbound.

1881
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:11,000
It was actually originally kind of a Blues Brother-y tribute,

1882
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:14,000
which it's kind of evident in the finished product of the game.

1883
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:18,000
But I can't remember, it's the DMC or something like that?

1884
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
There's Pinball. I just saw Pinball.

1885
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,000
I forgot there was Pinball in the arcade.

1886
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Sweet.

1887
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:30,000
But there's also the band in Mother 3 is also kind of clearly ripped off another band.

1888
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,000
Escapes me.

1889
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Well, that's the game.

1890
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:40,000
Mother 2 slash Earthbound with strong hints towards Mother 3.

1891
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:42,000
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week.

1892
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,000
Earthbound, Mother 2.

1893
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:47,000
And a little dash of Mother 3, but we have to save that for another week.

1894
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:50,000
We should do a Gaiden version called Daddy.

1895
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Anyhow, that's going to do it for Part A, but don't go anywhere.

1896
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,000
We have plenty more to come.

1897
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,000
We may not have a whole lot of news, but we do have the rapid-fire news.

1898
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
We have your Fugu question of the week coming up as well.

1899
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Mailbag and Match Game coming back tonight in Part B.

1900
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,000
Don't go anywhere, guys.

1901
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:08,000
We'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1902
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:17,000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1903
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Live here on November the 25th of 2012 with the 483rd episode of our show.

1904
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:26,000
It's a little bit of a slower news week this week,

1905
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
but that's all right.

1906
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
We still have some news stories to talk about,

1907
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:33,000
including the rapid-fire news, which is coming up right now.

1908
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Loki.

1909
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Yes.

1910
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:40,000
So let's talk about my favorite gaming series, Grand Theft Auto.

1911
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Grand Theft Auto had a wonderful release on iOS and Android of Grand Theft Auto 3,

1912
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:49,000
celebrating the 10th anniversary earlier this year, maybe even last year.

1913
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,000
I can't remember.

1914
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:54,000
But soon enough, you'll be able to get some more Grand Theft Auto love

1915
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:58,000
on your portable devices with Grand Theft Auto Vice City,

1916
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:02,000
the HD treatment for the 10th anniversary of that game as well.

1917
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:07,000
So I'm hoping that San Andreas is only a couple more years away.

1918
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:11,000
And that'll be available on December 6th,

1919
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:17,000
and apparently it's going to cost you $5 on both Android or iOS.

1920
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
That's fantastic.

1921
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
I cannot wait.

1922
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Except I can, because I'm not actually going to play it on the phone,

1923
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:30,000
because gaming on the phone sucks.

1924
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
And then to kind of go along with that,

1925
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:40,000
there's kind of a fan campaign to try to get Grand Theft Auto 5 onto PC and the Wii U.

1926
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:45,000
And of course, developers are like, well, anything is up for consideration.

1927
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
And of course, they haven't announced anything.

1928
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Right now, they're mainly focused on getting the game out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

1929
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:57,000
It's hard to say if there's actually going to be a PC version for the game.

1930
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:01,000
The scene is that there wasn't one for Red Dead Redemption,

1931
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
although there was one for L.A. Noire.

1932
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
So I don't know.

1933
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:08,000
It'd be kind of cool if it was on PC, because that game looks fantastic.

1934
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:11,000
I don't know.

1935
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:14,000
I may need to get a new PC for that if they do end up getting one.

1936
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:19,000
And then also, of course, Reggie threw in his two cents saying,

1937
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:22,000
yeah, we'd totally love Grand Theft Auto 5 on the Wii U.

1938
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:25,000
Yes, that would probably be a nice system selling game now, wouldn't it?

1939
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Except right now, it's still up in the air.

1940
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:32,000
And last but not least, I'm not sure this should make you angry or excited,

1941
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
the fact that this is coming out over here.

1942
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:42,000
The Bayonetta DLC that was available in Japan is coming to North America.

1943
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:46,000
However, it's coming to North America as a GameStop exclusive.

1944
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:50,000
And I guess it will be kind of a day one limited edition.

1945
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Also in Europe, the U.S., you're going to have to wait until it comes out in January.

1946
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:03,000
And if you really want that DLC, you're going to have to wait and purchase it from GameStop.

1947
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
And the game is supposed to be a lot cheaper.

1948
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:09,000
It's only $29.99 as opposed to a full-price game.

1949
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:15,000
It is kind of disappointing, though, that GameStop locked in the DLC for that.

1950
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
I hate that. Whatever.

1951
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
I mean, you never know. That stuff could come out later on.

1952
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:20,000
They could sell it later.

1953
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:27,000
But just throwing GameStop alone, I guess, and giving them exclusive DLC.

1954
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:30,000
Not going to hold my breath.

1955
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:32,000
All right. Well, moving on.

1956
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,000
This is pretty good.

1957
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
I mean, I know we've talked about some Vita hardships,

1958
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
but there's a lot of good stuff to talk about on Vita right now,

1959
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:40,000
not just the free games, but price reductions.

1960
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:45,000
November 27th is going to see some price reductions on the PlayStation Network for the download.

1961
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:48,000
You know, if you have a memory card large enough to hold some games,

1962
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,000
you can get some games for a lot cheaper than they used to be.

1963
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:57,000
For $17.99, Hot Shots Golf, Little Deviants, MLB 12 The Show, ModNation Racers,

1964
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,000
Reality Fighters, and Wipeout 2048.

1965
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:05,000
$26.99, Resistance Burning Skies, Smart As, not to be confused with Smart As,

1966
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:09,000
and Unit 13, and then $35.99 for Uncharted Golden Abyss,

1967
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:13,000
but as mentioned before, you could get that free with PlayStation Plus.

1968
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
You would just have to kind of juggle, like, you know,

1969
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:19,000
remember when you are on PlayStation Plus, if you let your account lapse,

1970
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:20,000
you'll lose all those free games.

1971
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:24,000
So you kind of have to weigh, is that something I really want to be locked into?

1972
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
I don't mind it, personally, because I don't, you know,

1973
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
the games I'm getting for free aren't things that, like,

1974
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:32,000
if I really want a game bad enough that I can revisit whenever, I'll buy it.

1975
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:37,000
But I like that PlayStation Plus kind of allows me to play games I might have missed from a couple years ago.

1976
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:40,000
So, I don't know, I don't want to sound like a mouthpiece for Sony,

1977
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:45,000
but I'm glad to see that they're reducing the price of some of these games.

1978
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Might be what the system needs right now.

1979
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Darkstalker Resurrection, some folks looking forward to this.

1980
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:56,000
This is the Darkstalker games for Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.

1981
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,000
Happy, happy, happy.

1982
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,000
This is that collection.

1983
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Yep, there's also going to be a new tournament, an online tournament mode coming in the game.

1984
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
This is according to Capcom Unity.

1985
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:06,000
The online mode is going to support eight players.

1986
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Sudden Death, One Takes All, Best of Two or Best of Three.

1987
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:14,000
Resurrection will also include the usual ranked and player matches.

1988
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Resurrection, of course, being the name of this download game.

1989
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Pretty cool there.

1990
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:24,000
And you can do replays on YouTube, so can't wait for YouTube to get flooded with this stuff.

1991
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,000
So that's pretty cool.

1992
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:31,000
14.99 on PlayStation Network, 1200 Microsoft points on Xbox Live Arcade when it comes out in 2013.

1993
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:36,000
If you're a fan of Half-Minute Hero, maybe you're wondering when are we getting Half-Minute Hero 2.

1994
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Well, Marvelous producer Esteban Salazar told Siliconera that,

1995
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:45,000
quote, it's considerably more expensive to put out the sequel,

1996
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:50,000
and they need to sell a lot more of the first game on PC to begin to justify it.

1997
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:53,000
If this is something you're interested in, you might want to, quote,

1998
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:57,000
encourage your friends to buy the Steam version or buy it for them.

1999
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:00,000
P.S., the game's 40% off on Steam right now.

2000
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Actually, that wasn't in the quote, but that sure seemed to be convenient.

2001
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:09,000
So, yep, you want Half-Minute Hero 2, buy part one for friends.

2002
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Half-Minute Hero was kind of fun.

2003
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
I mean, I'm not going to cry if the sequel never comes out,

2004
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:18,000
but I'm surprised it didn't sell enough to necessitate the sequel.

2005
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Dark Sakura.

2006
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Stuff happened. The end. No, I'm kidding.

2007
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:31,000
For fans of the AM2 games, they are going to be out on Xbox Live Arcade

2008
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
and PlayStation Network during the week.

2009
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:37,000
We have Fighting Vipers, Sonic the Fighters, which I'm more excited about,

2010
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:40,000
and Virtua Fighter 2, which I could give less than a crap about,

2011
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:44,000
but I'm usually very alone in that.

2012
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,000
The games are going to have their own achievements and trophies

2013
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:49,000
and will support online multiplayer.

2014
01:49:49,000 --> 01:50:00,000
They will be about five bucks each and about 4.49 euro in Europe.

2015
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:07,000
So they'll be out on November 27th in North America and December 5th in Europe.

2016
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Man, I have Fighters Megamix at home,

2017
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:17,000
and I wish that they would update Fighters Megamix. Wouldn't that be awesome?

2018
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:22,000
So anyway, Capcom's also getting back into more fighting game stuff.

2019
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:25,000
They've registered the name Fighters of Capcom.

2020
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:31,000
It's a trademark, actually, and they haven't really said what it's about,

2021
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:36,000
but maybe it'll be good. Hopefully.

2022
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:40,000
And moving forward, on the Korean ratings board,

2023
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:47,000
Resident Evil Revelations has been listed for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3,

2024
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:52,000
so that means we might actually be getting the version out for the bigger consoles.

2025
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Who knows? And that is that.

2026
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:59,000
All right. Let's take a trip over to Facebook and Google Plus,

2027
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:02,000
and when you slam those words together, you get Boogle.

2028
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:11,000
The Foogle Question of the Week.

2029
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:15,000
We ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities and look for some answers.

2030
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:20,000
And of course, it's got to be about the Wii U again this week, but with good reason.

2031
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:24,000
This is about kind of how we're feeling post launch of the Wii U.

2032
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Here's the question from our Facebook community at facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio

2033
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:30,000
and our Google Plus community. Search for Orange Launch Radio.

2034
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:33,000
Now that the console has been out for a week,

2035
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:38,000
have you found that your opinion has changed on the Wii U from the pre-release hype?

2036
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:43,000
Perhaps you weren't so excited about it before, but you ended up buying one for a reason,

2037
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:47,000
or you were really excited after E3, but found that maybe you'll hold off for a while.

2038
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:50,000
Why did or didn't your opinion change?

2039
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:53,000
Let's go to some comments first off from Facebook.

2040
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Wicked said, originally I wasn't too keen on the Wii U.

2041
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:02,000
It seemed like it was coming out too early for it to be a next-gen console,

2042
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:05,000
especially since the graphics wasn't much better than what was out now.

2043
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Also, sequelizing a console the way they did, essentially requiring the Wii to fully utilize the Wii U's potential,

2044
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
seemed like a cop-out.

2045
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
Wow, I was wrong.

2046
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:20,000
The graphics are definitely top notch, and the Wii's usual stigma of waggle wand was significantly downplayed.

2047
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:25,000
The games are amazing, especially Zombie U and Nintendo Land, which could easily be the party game of the year.

2048
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:29,000
As lukewarm as I was for the Wii U, I must say, after having it in my hands,

2049
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:34,000
which the tablet controller feels perfectly fine in, I am definitely on the bandwagon now.

2050
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:40,000
Virtual Phil said, I was excited for it, but also a bit meh regarding the annoying hype.

2051
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:45,000
However, now that I've played the console, and have had a ton of fun with Nintendo Land's multiplayer games,

2052
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:50,000
I'm loving it. I just wish the catalog of games was bigger from the outset.

2053
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Dark Charger said, Nintendo continues to struggle with online, and despite a good number of launch titles,

2054
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:59,000
there is really nothing worth buying the system for, yet.

2055
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Eventually there will hopefully be an F-Zero, Earthbound, yeah right, Metroid, or even better yet,

2056
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
some new IPs that will make me want to pick it up.

2057
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Playing yesterday's games that I can already play on my PS3 or 360 isn't going to do it.

2058
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:17,000
Doug T said, I'm holding off on buying the Wii U. I'm waiting for more high quality first party games.

2059
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:23,000
I have a PS3, which is my favorite console, so when games are released on all three consoles, I will buy it for my PS3.

2060
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:28,000
Also, I was disappointed with my Wii, so I'm waiting to see how the Wii U does over time.

2061
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:34,000
AZHP said, before the console launched, I was really hopeful that Nintendo had figured out online.

2062
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:37,000
Pause for Loki to scoff.

2063
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:42,000
They figured out that it's there. How to use it, maybe.

2064
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:47,000
Now that I'm hearing reports of how purchases are tied to the console instead of the Wii profile,

2065
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:52,000
that there are separate wallets for Wii and Wii U online purchases that are on the same console,

2066
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:56,000
and that profiles can't be transferred between consoles, I'm just disappointed in Nintendo.

2067
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:02,000
The 360 did online right, and they did it seven years ago. Shame on Nintendo.

2068
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:06,000
This answer is a little lengthy from dinner at Johnny's, so I'm not going to read the whole thing,

2069
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:12,000
but basically said, you know, when Reggie said that they're going to cater to hardcore gamers, he was very excited.

2070
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Now that it's launched, my anticipation dropped considerably, partially because the console lacks focus on an achievement and trophy system.

2071
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Nintendo did this for the benefit of the developers.

2072
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:29,000
And he kind of goes on to talk about how it's like a standard thing now, how Blizzard and all this does this.

2073
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:32,000
I'm kind of disappointed they missed the boat on that, too.

2074
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Especially because, you know, on the 3DS, they have the whole accomplishments thing in the plaza.

2075
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
I thought they were going this direction.

2076
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:43,000
You know, it's... Oops.

2077
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:47,000
We're not ready for the mailbag yet. Be quiet, music.

2078
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Sorry about that. Live radio, it's fun.

2079
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:56,000
So, yeah, I, you know, I don't think it's like a deal breaker for the system.

2080
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:01,000
It's disappointing, but what do you want to bet it's one of those things that just suddenly shows up later?

2081
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
Let's see.

2082
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:08,000
I'm looking at some of the comments in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

2083
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:13,000
BlackWolf said, to be fair, Nintendo said that you'll be able to transfer profiles yourself soon.

2084
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:16,000
And that they can already transfer them if you call them.

2085
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:22,000
But yes, it's not there on launch day, because obviously we all bought multiple Wii U's and really want to be able to transfer our profiles in the first week.

2086
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:29,000
BlackWolf, again, it's the hole they're building it as they go along, and how obvious is it?

2087
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:34,000
I mean, I get it. You're right. It's not like we all have multiple Wii U's right now.

2088
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:39,000
But, I mean, you know, people still make their decisions. Anyway.

2089
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Pete Garuno says, I was cautiously optimistic when it was announced.

2090
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:46,000
Indifferent when more details emerged, but then I tried a demo unit and could see the potential.

2091
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:55,000
One of my friends bought it on launch, and seeing that the social aspects of sending picture messages, asking other players for help on a specific point is kind of selling it for me.

2092
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Can't really justify the purchase at the moment, though, so it's currently on my wait for a major price reduction pile.

2093
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:09,000
Let's see, going to Code Man. I haven't bought one yet, but I've played with one here, and they're at different electronic stores.

2094
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:14,000
I have to say that the tech is pretty cool, and being a designer, the interface is well done as well.

2095
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:20,000
What's keeping me from buying it, though, is I don't believe Nintendo is done with it, and tried to rush it out before the holiday season.

2096
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:24,000
So until everything is working correctly, I would love to get my hands on one.

2097
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:28,000
The only flaw in your logic I see is that, again, it's about the games.

2098
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:34,000
It's not necessarily about the hardware, or even the firmware that's on said hardware.

2099
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:41,000
I mean, if they're writing that as they go along, it's weird, but it's not really a deal breaker if Mario HD is still going to be Mario HD at the end of the day.

2100
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
Think about that. That's all I'm saying.

2101
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:49,000
But I can see what he's saying, though, because if you look at the Wii, remember the Wii came out, and then they're all,

2102
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:53,000
Oh, MotionPlus, because we really wanted these controllers more sensitive.

2103
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:56,000
So now we have Wii MotionPlus, and oh, you bought MotionPlus.

2104
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:00,000
You know what? Now we have this fancy controller that already has it incorporated into it.

2105
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Yay. Oh, wait, now we need this other controller to do something, and you need that for this game.

2106
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:13,000
That's fair. I understand that. The whole Wii MotionPlus, or the Vitality Sensor.

2107
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Ooh. LOL.

2108
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
Okay, Google Plus time.

2109
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Evil says, hype level has generally been the same.

2110
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Actually, it's E3VL, but it says evil to me.

2111
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
Hype level has been generally the same.

2112
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:28,000
Nintendo's consoles will always be my go-to for first-party content.

2113
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:34,000
My only concern is that if the Wii U will be my main console after Microsoft and Sony releases their next system,

2114
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:37,000
seeing if Nintendo is consistent with quality of third-party ports.

2115
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Retertainment says my opinion has not changed.

2116
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:43,000
I still have priorities that are higher on my list than buying a Wii U.

2117
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:46,000
Not that I think a Wii U would be good buy or a bad buy.

2118
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
I'd just rather save for a house right now.

2119
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,000
I don't think I'm alone in this opinion.

2120
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:52,000
Priorities are important. I'll give you that.

2121
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Rabababa says, now that I've played it a few days, the pad is better than expected.

2122
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:01,000
It can do a lot of unique things. Best of all, it can look up hints on the internet without an extra device.

2123
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Very few games take advantage of it.

2124
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Flaco Jones says, I got a chance to play it for a few hours, and my opinion hasn't changed much.

2125
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:11,000
I still think it's way overpriced when comparing it to the competition,

2126
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:16,000
and the controller didn't sway me with the small selection of games that utilize it halfway decently.

2127
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Better games would definitely be the best way to change my mind.

2128
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Sean F. replied and said, I was never really excited. My PS3 and PSP are enough for me.

2129
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:29,000
And Nick M. said, yeah, it went from being a polished, well-presented turd

2130
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:32,000
to just a turd that sits in the corner of my living room.

2131
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,000
So you bought one?

2132
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:38,000
I'd be curious to hear more about you bought one and it's sitting in your living room unused.

2133
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:42,000
I want to hear more about that. Please elaborate for later.

2134
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:45,000
And I want to hear about your collection of polished turds. No, I'm kidding.

2135
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:51,000
But I haven't heard of anybody who's bought one that said, yeah, it's already collecting dust in the corner.

2136
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:55,000
I'm very curious to explore that further, so please send an email or something.

2137
01:58:55,000 --> 01:59:00,000
It's very possible it collected fingerprints because I'm sure it can collect fingerprints quite well.

2138
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:03,000
Yeah, it does. Especially the black ones.

2139
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:06,000
Alright, I read all the comments tonight because I'm nice.

2140
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Code Man is in chat, by the way, saying, to kind of clarify the comment,

2141
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:13,000
I really want to check out Zombie You. And I do agree it's about the games, Rob,

2142
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:17,000
but I do think they should get the console into control before a good title can be released.

2143
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:21,000
In light of what Loki said, I get a little more what you're saying now.

2144
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Alright, couple stories for you guys and then we're going to get to the match game. Yay!

2145
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:31,000
Alright, so we had a little bit of a comment before about talking about console generations

2146
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:35,000
and kind of how they want things to change.

2147
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:39,000
Well, THQ kind of got themselves into a little, well, it's not even really THQ,

2148
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:46,000
but like the publisher, 4A, and I guess one of the THQ PR guys,

2149
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:52,000
they've been trying to cover up, cover up I guess, defuse a situation that happened on Twitter.

2150
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:56,000
I think it was on Twitter. Anyways, during an interview,

2151
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:03,000
It's always Twitter. Take away people's PR people and like they say the dumbest shit.

2152
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:06,000
That's why Twitter is great. Honestly.

2153
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:14,000
So I think at least part of it took place on Twitter. It's basically talking about how the Wii U's CPU is slow.

2154
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:19,000
And the quote is actually, the Wii U has a horrible, slow CPU.

2155
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:23,000
And that's why they're saying that Metro Last Light is not going to be ported to the Wii U

2156
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:30,000
is because the game system has a slow CPU and that it would just be impossible.

2157
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:37,000
So, of course, THQ doesn't want to have this whole stigma of,

2158
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:43,000
Oh, yeah, we just totally dogged in that system, but we want to put some games out on it.

2159
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:48,000
And have Nintendo go, yeah, fuck you guys. You're not going on our system.

2160
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:51,000
But if you think about it, THQ doesn't have a whole ton of,

2161
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:55,000
I mean, they have a few games, I guess, that were launched. There was Darksiders 2.

2162
02:00:55,000 --> 02:01:04,000
And it's not out yet, but they've got Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy that they're porting over to that.

2163
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:09,000
Not necessarily CPU intensive games. I mean, Darksiders may be a little bit, but you know,

2164
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:12,000
Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune, not quite so much.

2165
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:19,000
So, I don't know. It's interesting, though, they have basically the developer saying one thing

2166
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:25,000
and then THQ is kind of like saying, Oh, well, it's not necessarily what they meant.

2167
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:28,000
They're just saying that, oh, it's a very CPU intensive game.

2168
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:36,000
And, you know, that, I don't know, maybe that this, you know, we use CPU wouldn't be able to handle this or something.

2169
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:40,000
And then there's some other developers saying, well, you know, sounds like, you know,

2170
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:44,000
they just couldn't even bother, you know, trying to port the game, you know, port over,

2171
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:50,000
because it does have a faster GPU and a lot more RAM than the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360.

2172
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:57,000
And of course, you know, it's this Gustav Halling saying, you know, yeah, you know, GPU and RAM's nice.

2173
02:01:57,000 --> 02:02:00,000
They have shaders and textures loaded, but physics and gameplay are on CPU.

2174
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:04,000
So, I don't know. Will that be a problem? Possibly.

2175
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:10,000
I don't know. It'd be interesting to see if we get, you know, if Grand Theft Auto 5 doesn't come to the Wii U

2176
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:16,000
because it's got a slow CPU and can't load, you know, can't load the world fast enough or something like that.

2177
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Tigerclaw with a fair thought in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

2178
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:24,000
Maybe the Wii U having a better GPU and a slow CPU is a tradeoff.

2179
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:30,000
Nintendo wanted a system with really great graphics, but had to sacrifice CPU in order to bring the cost of the system down,

2180
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:34,000
which is why some games like Arkham City have frame rate drops.

2181
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:41,000
That's not good. I mean, I understand that you, if you're going to make sacrifices and you're not ready,

2182
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:45,000
then you need to wait until that tech comes down in price.

2183
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:49,000
You know, maybe when the console will be more finished, but that's going to be a problem

2184
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:54,000
because if you're not willing to put the technology into it, you're going to have these next-gen systems come out

2185
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
and they're just going to run circles around you.

2186
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Yeah. And I, you know, the frame rate drop in Arkham City,

2187
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:03,000
I'm chalking that up to the fact that it's a port of a game that wasn't designed for the console.

2188
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:06,000
I'm really curious what 2013's games are going to look like.

2189
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
That's really what's going to define the Wii U, honestly.

2190
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
And I'm sure the first-party games will look nice.

2191
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,000
That's what they always kind of base their sales off of.

2192
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:13,000
That's what always happens with Nintendo.

2193
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:17,000
So, I mean, that'll look nice because they're developing for the system,

2194
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:21,000
but you're going to have to wonder with some of these game systems that are already out there now

2195
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:24,000
and you're going to have a Wii U version coming out at the same time.

2196
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:30,000
And honestly, it's just, for me, it seems like it's like, okay, Nintendo told these publishers,

2197
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:34,000
hey, by the way, you've got to have this gimmick that's thrown in there.

2198
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:41,000
Like, for example, NBA 2K13, you can hold up the Wii U's game pad to see which of your, you know,

2199
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:47,000
athletes or whatever are tired, which is funny because you can do the same thing on any of the other consoles

2200
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:51,000
by pressing start and that same information comes up there.

2201
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:55,000
It's like, it's not necessary to have that.

2202
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:59,000
It's kind of the same thing that you have with some of these games that support Kinect,

2203
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:03,000
where you have voice commands to do shit that you can do with the button press.

2204
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:08,000
It's just, it's there to use the hardware so they can say, hey, we've got, you know,

2205
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:14,000
this game that supports these extra features or whatever, but really these features aren't needed for this gameplay.

2206
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:16,000
It's not adding anything really new.

2207
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:19,000
And you're going to see a lot of this, I think, with the Wii U

2208
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:24,000
because you saw a lot of this with the DS and the 3DS is that they don't know how to use this extra screen.

2209
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:28,000
So you're going to have the stuff that was originally in the start menu on the other screen.

2210
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:31,000
And yeah, it's cool that you don't have to stop gameplay,

2211
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:38,000
but you're still going to have to take your eyes off the screen to fiddle with your inventory or something like that.

2212
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:43,000
That, you know, pushing start and pausing the game so you have time to do that

2213
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:48,000
might not be a bad thing instead of getting killed by something while you're having to look off screen.

2214
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Going to our chat room with some comments at live.vognetwork.com.

2215
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Rama says, I'm waiting for Mario Kart and Bayonetta 2.

2216
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:59,000
And Dungeon Buster says, I'm mostly waiting on Bayonetta 2.

2217
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Rama says, by the way, I feel bad for people eBaying Wii U's. It's pointless.

2218
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Don't feel bad for them. Point and laugh at them.

2219
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:10,000
I think it's hilarious that that whole scheme is backfiring

2220
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:15,000
because those people that are buying consoles just to flip them and take them away from somebody who might really want them,

2221
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
fuck them. I hope they lose a lot of money.

2222
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:21,000
I hope they get stuck with all those Twinkies too and have to eat them.

2223
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:24,000
So you know what? I feel no sympathy for them.

2224
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:28,000
Unless it was like legitimately bought and maybe being flipped around

2225
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:32,000
because a person decided, well, I don't want this polished turd sitting in the corner of my room anymore.

2226
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:35,000
That's different, like a used Wii U already or whatever.

2227
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:40,000
But like somebody who bought it just to try and flip it for an increased cost, middle finger to you.

2228
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
I don't care that you're out $400.

2229
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:45,000
They'll take them back to the store and get their money back, which is also bullshit.

2230
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
But, you know, it is what it is.

2231
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Anyhow, piggybacking on this a little bit.

2232
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:55,000
There's a piece in the New York Times that is kind of a, like, it's in the New York Times.

2233
02:05:55,000 --> 02:06:01,000
It's not really an opinion article, but it certainly kind of looks at, did Nintendo do the right thing?

2234
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
Is the Wii U a good system?

2235
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:09,000
And they go to a familiar name for a quote, which, you know, this little quote from the New York Times article is making its way around the game blogs.

2236
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:12,000
And the quote is from Nolan Bushnell.

2237
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:13,000
You recognize that name?

2238
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:14,000
Yep.

2239
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Yeah, what did he do, Jamie?

2240
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:18,000
Um, Chuck E. Cheese.

2241
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:20,000
Yes, and Pong. Pong, too.

2242
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:21,000
Yes.

2243
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:22,000
Yes, and Chuck E. Cheese. That's important, too.

2244
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:27,000
Well, quote, I am actually, I actually am baffled by it.

2245
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:30,000
I don't think it's going to be a big success.

2246
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:32,000
That's the quote.

2247
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
Let's see, what else did he say here?

2248
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:40,000
Quote, these things will continue to sputter along, but I really don't think they'll be of major import ever again.

2249
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:42,000
It feels like the end of an era to me.

2250
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:48,000
And, of course, that has all the game blogs going, Nolan Bushnell thinks the Wii U is an end of an era, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2251
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:59,000
And the, it's important to note that this article also kind of takes the stance of, that mobile, it's another one of those pieces that say mobile gaming's going to kill it all.

2252
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:02,000
And, you know, Nintendo's just trying to get into tablet gaming with this.

2253
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:09,000
And so, I don't know how I feel about all this, but it is interesting that Nolan Bushnell kind of throws his two cents out there.

2254
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Granted, it's one small quote out of what I hope was a larger interview, but is it the end of an era?

2255
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Is the Wii U the swan song of console gaming as we know it?

2256
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:21,000
No.

2257
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:22,000
I hardly think so.

2258
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:23,000
No.

2259
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:32,000
It's just stupid, I mean, because you're just, once again, you're kind of assuming that everyone's going to buy into it or not going to buy into it and go,

2260
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:34,000
Oh, no, what am I going to game on now?

2261
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:39,000
I just don't understand, like, why everyone thinks if these next-gen consoles fail that the whole industry's going to fail.

2262
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
Hey, you have some consoles that still work.

2263
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
You know what happens if a console fails?

2264
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:46,000
Guess what, they just make games for other consoles.

2265
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:47,000
It's just like the Vita.

2266
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:51,000
If the Vita fails, guess what, they'll just make games for the 3DS and the DS.

2267
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:56,000
Black Wolf kind of puts Nolan's words in another light here, saying,

2268
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:59,000
No more TV gaming all going handheld mobile now.

2269
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:01,000
That's what Nolan thinks.

2270
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:04,000
More people play mobile games than ever played console games.

2271
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:11,000
So maybe he's thinking, maybe Nolan is going this way because of the Wii U invoking the tablet thing,

2272
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
kind of trying to get that piece of mobile game.

2273
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:18,000
But for me, the part that people miss when they jump to that conclusion is that they're not putting,

2274
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:22,000
I mean, the Wii U kind of can't do those same tablet games.

2275
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:26,000
It really is a second screen that does have limited touch controls.

2276
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:28,000
It just means you can play while you pee.

2277
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,000
Partially.

2278
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:33,000
Well, I told you about that shirt that I saw.

2279
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
My iPhone has changed the way I go to the bathroom.

2280
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:36,000
Right.

2281
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:37,000
Well, I mean, think about it.

2282
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
It's gaming anywhere that you want to.

2283
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:43,000
And there's an attraction there, but I mean, I don't think it's the end of an era.

2284
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:47,000
It's just an evolution of access.

2285
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:48,000
Yeah.

2286
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:51,000
There's only so much of, like, Cut the Rope and Angry Birds I can tolerate.

2287
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:54,000
And those aren't the games I want to play when I'm sitting on my couch.

2288
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:59,000
I guarantee there's going to be DS virtual console games by next year.

2289
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:00,000
Oh.

2290
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Oh, with the whole, yeah, because since there is second screen anyway.

2291
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
The screen is set up exactly like a DS.

2292
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:06,000
Why not?

2293
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:13,000
I think clearly it all indicates a return to animatronic restaurants.

2294
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:17,000
Blackwill following up saying, well, what he's saying is that the new console isn't selling out.

2295
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:20,000
So people have stopped buying new game consoles.

2296
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:21,000
I think it is actually selling out.

2297
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
It's just that they're replenishing a lot faster.

2298
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:28,000
And Nintendo's also not advertising it because maybe, you know, and there's a lot of theories behind that.

2299
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:32,000
But, you know, maybe to their benefit, they know they're going to be limited.

2300
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:35,000
So why, I mean, the people that want to buy them already know about it.

2301
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
So why have that advertising push behind it?

2302
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:44,000
Let that grow a little more organically and then do the big advertising push in January, February when you need it.

2303
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:45,000
Spend your gift card on a Wii U.

2304
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
You know, that stuff.

2305
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:54,000
Blackwolf continuing on trying to push the points here.

2306
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:59,000
But Cut the Rope and Angry Birds are the games that majority of game buyers want to play.

2307
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
We're the minority now.

2308
02:10:02,000 --> 02:10:13,000
Yes and no to me because I feel like the majority audience that's buying Cut the Rope and Angry Birds is an audience that didn't exist before.

2309
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:18,000
Did people really switch from console gaming to exclusive mobile gaming?

2310
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:21,000
I don't really think that's what happened.

2311
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:27,000
Yeah, people into Angry Birds are, you know, people like my aunt who is well into her 60s.

2312
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:31,000
And it's, you know, you're basically not your average gamer.

2313
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:35,000
It's people getting into it who have never gotten into gaming before.

2314
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:39,000
So, yeah, I can understand that, okay, that's where a lot of money is at and so forth.

2315
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:48,000
But the console industry has been afloat for the years since 1978 with, say, the video game crash of 83, 84.

2316
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:51,000
The video game industry has been afloat without that audience.

2317
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:55,000
So, I don't know. Anyhow.

2318
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:58,000
Alright, let's move on.

2319
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:03,000
Bojikawa wants to say, I keep hearing that the Wii U hasn't been advertised.

2320
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
I don't watch TV but I do watch Hulu.

2321
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:09,000
I've seen the commercial for the Wii U many a times there the last couple of weeks.

2322
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:12,000
It's also your audience is most likely to be aware of things like that.

2323
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Like that's still targeting like your tech crowd.

2324
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:20,000
There's a big difference between running Wii U commercials there and running Wii U commercials on Saturday morning cartoons.

2325
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
But anyway, I digress.

2326
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
Let's play some match game.

2327
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
We need to do match game.

2328
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:29,000
We haven't done match game in forever on this show.

2329
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:37,000
Alright, if you want to play match game in our chat room, let's see.

2330
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:46,000
If you want to play match game, then type the name of the second town in Earthbound, our classic game of the week tonight.

2331
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
It's really easy, you guys. It's really easy.

2332
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:51,000
Type the name of that in the chat. We'll pick one player at random.

2333
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:54,000
We'll also open the Skype line in just a minute.

2334
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:57,000
But I want to introduce our celebrities tonight for match game.

2335
02:11:57,000 --> 02:12:01,000
Joining us for the match game tonight, Dark Sakura.

2336
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
You've never heard her before.

2337
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:04,000
Hi.

2338
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:07,000
Also joining us for the match game tonight is Tech Master Loki.

2339
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:08,000
Hi.

2340
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:11,000
And I'm going to be joining you for the match game tonight.

2341
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:12,000
Woo hoo.

2342
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:15,000
Also joining us for the match game tonight, Say Hello 2.

2343
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
It's your first time on the show. Be gentle.

2344
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:18,000
Rachel.

2345
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:19,000
Howdy.

2346
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:20,000
How you doing?

2347
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:24,000
Are you here to promote anything tonight? Is there a new movie coming out that you need to promote?

2348
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:25,000
Or a book?

2349
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
Uh, quick blog plug?

2350
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:28,000
Yeah, sure.

2351
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:31,000
Uh, greetings from the wasteland at WordPress.

2352
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:32,000
There you go.

2353
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
Uh, greetings from the wasteland. Sorry.

2354
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:39,000
But it doesn't stop there. We have one more person playing match game with us tonight.

2355
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
Say hello, everybody, to Alan.

2356
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Raspberry.

2357
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:45,000
How are you doing, Alan?

2358
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:46,000
Good.

2359
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
Is there anything?

2360
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
Are you doing your Carol Channing for us tonight?

2361
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Is that, uh, is that, uh, what you're going to do match game as?

2362
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:54,000
No, I'm fine.

2363
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:56,000
Do you have anything you want to promote tonight?

2364
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:58,000
No.

2365
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:00,000
Do you want to promote Fabulous Flank?

2366
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
Oh, I'm really sorry about that.

2367
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:07,000
I want to promote new internet that's not dropping out.

2368
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
Yeah, apparently it's doing pretty well.

2369
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:10,000
So, hooray to that.

2370
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line.

2371
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:16,000
If you want to, remember, we're going to have one contestant in the chat room, one on the Skype line.

2372
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:19,000
If you want to play match game, call us in the Skype line right now.

2373
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:24,000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2374
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:27,000
So, we're going to pick one person on the phones and another from our chat room.

2375
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:30,000
Uh, it looks like we have a few correct answers right now.

2376
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:35,000
So, again, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username in Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2377
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:38,000
While we wait for that call, because there is a little bit of a delay still,

2378
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:41,000
and I think the delay got longer because of our setup,

2379
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:44,000
but that's okay, I'd rather it be a longer delay and not drop out as much.

2380
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:49,000
Um, so, anyhow, what I want to, oh, we got a call coming in.

2381
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:52,000
Let's, let's see.

2382
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:55,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

2383
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
Hey, this is SSJ100 Matt.

2384
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
Hey, SSJ100 Matt, how you doing?

2385
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Hi, how are you?

2386
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:02,000
I feel like I haven't heard from you in a while.

2387
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,000
You did alright through Sandy and all that?

2388
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
I did, actually.

2389
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:07,000
Good, good, I'm glad to hear it.

2390
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
Well, are you ready to play some match game with us tonight?

2391
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:10,000
Hells yeah.

2392
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:11,000
Hells yeah.

2393
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Hells yeah.

2394
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:16,000
Alright, it looks like we have only four people in chat that want to play along,

2395
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
so, uh, let's see.

2396
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:21,000
Alan, since you can't see chat, pick a number between one and four.

2397
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:22,000
Two.

2398
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:26,000
Two, meaning actdeft is going to play along in our chat room.

2399
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:31,000
So, actdeft is our chatter tonight, so let me just send him a message.

2400
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
Stand by.

2401
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:36,000
Okay, so, here we go.

2402
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:42,000
We have actdeft versus SSJ100 Matt, because we haven't played this in a long time.

2403
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:43,000
Here's how it works.

2404
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:47,000
We're going to read a question, and that question will have a blank.

2405
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:51,000
Your job is to match the stars here in studio.

2406
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
You're going to come up with the answer that goes in that blank,

2407
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:56,000
and for every person that you match, you get a point.

2408
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:59,000
Keep in mind, actdeft is playing against you in the chat room.

2409
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
He'll be sending his answers over a private message,

2410
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
and you will be giving yours over the phone,

2411
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:09,000
but remember, please do not give your answers until we have a ding from everybody here in the studio.

2412
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:12,000
All right, do you understand the rules, SSJ100 Matt?

2413
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:13,000
I do.

2414
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:14,000
All right, that's because you've played before.

2415
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:15,000
All right, yes, Alan?

2416
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:16,000
Yeah.

2417
02:15:16,000 --> 02:15:18,000
I just want to add that we're all really bad at this,

2418
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
because I remember the last time we played this,

2419
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:23,000
and not a single one of us matched shit with anyone.

2420
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
That's the joke.

2421
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
No, it's not.

2422
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
All right, here we go.

2423
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:33,000
Let's get into tonight's first question.

2424
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,000
Drum roll, please.

2425
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Here we go.

2426
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:37,000
Tonight's first question.

2427
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:39,000
Four questions tonight.

2428
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:43,000
As Space Harrier's biggest fan,

2429
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:48,000
Jamie is very excited about Space Harrier coming to the 3DS.

2430
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:52,000
She found it odd, though, that in her honor,

2431
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:55,000
the designers changed the opening line from

2432
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:58,000
welcome to the fantasy zone, get ready,

2433
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:09,000
to welcome to the blank, get ready.

2434
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:10,000
As Space Harrier's biggest fan,

2435
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:13,000
Jamie is very excited about Space Harrier coming to the 3DS.

2436
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:16,000
She found it odd, though, that in her honor,

2437
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:19,000
the designers changed the opening line from

2438
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
welcome to the fantasy zone, get ready,

2439
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:24,000
to welcome to the...

2440
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:25,000
What the fuck was that?

2441
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:28,000
Welcome to the blank, get ready.

2442
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
I'm sorry you've been beeped.

2443
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:34,000
Apparently, I got censored by this crappy Think Music MP3,

2444
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:35,000
so we'll pause that.

2445
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:39,000
All right, so I'm going to say ding.

2446
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:40,000
Ding.

2447
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Ding.

2448
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:42,000
Ding, Alan.

2449
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:43,000
Ding.

2450
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:44,000
Ding.

2451
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:45,000
Okay, so we have five.

2452
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:46,000
Okay, I see the answer in chat.

2453
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:49,000
SSJ100, Matt, do you have an answer?

2454
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:50,000
I do.

2455
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Welcome to the...

2456
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:53,000
Welcome to the Citadel.

2457
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:56,000
Welcome to the Citadel, get ready.

2458
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
Ah, going for the Mass Effect joke there.

2459
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
Well, let's check in with the woman herself.

2460
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
They're changing it from welcome to the fantasy zone,

2461
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
get ready, to welcome to the...

2462
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:05,000
Fantasy zone.

2463
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:06,000
What?

2464
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:10,000
PH8, fantasy zone, the RPG.

2465
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:13,000
Oh, look at you, clever gal.

2466
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:17,000
Because I'm fucking clever.

2467
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,000
Somebody put that down as the quote of the night,

2468
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:21,000
because I'm fucking clever.

2469
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:22,000
Rachel.

2470
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:23,000
Frenzy from school.

2471
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
How well do we know Jamie?

2472
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:26,000
Welcome to the...

2473
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:27,000
Wii U.

2474
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:30,000
Welcome to the Wii U, get ready.

2475
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:31,000
Wait, what was...

2476
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:32,000
Act Def.

2477
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:33,000
Oh, I'm so sorry.

2478
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Act Def.

2479
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:35,000
I'm not ignoring Act Def.

2480
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
Act Def said...

2481
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:38,000
Garrus zone.

2482
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:39,000
I'm a little rusty.

2483
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:40,000
I'm out of practice.

2484
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:41,000
We haven't played this in over a year.

2485
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Welcome to the Garrus zone, get ready.

2486
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:47,000
So two Mass Effect answers, but a little different there.

2487
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:49,000
So we have welcome to the Citadel, welcome to the Garrus zone.

2488
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
All right, Loki, welcome to the...

2489
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:52,000
I have Citadel.

2490
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:53,000
Did you really?

2491
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:54,000
I did.

2492
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
A point for SSJ 100 mass.

2493
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:57,000
Look at that, Alan.

2494
02:17:57,000 --> 02:17:59,000
Look at that, a point.

2495
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:00,000
I have it.

2496
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:01,000
It's typed on my screen and everything.

2497
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:03,000
All right, there it is.

2498
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:04,000
All right.

2499
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Speaking of Alan, who says that these things always end in a 0-0 tie, welcome to the...

2500
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:11,000
Pinkberry.

2501
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
That was a good answer.

2502
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:15,000
I should have said Pinkberry.

2503
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:16,000
That is a good answer.

2504
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
Welcome to the Pinkberry, get ready.

2505
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:23,000
And my answer was welcome to the Normandy, get ready.

2506
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:24,000
So close.

2507
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:25,000
So close.

2508
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:26,000
So close.

2509
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:27,000
But you know what?

2510
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:29,000
I'm not taking pity because you already got a point.

2511
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:30,000
So there it is.

2512
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:33,000
The score all in the lead there.

2513
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
SSJ 100 mass has one point.

2514
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,000
Act Def has zero.

2515
02:18:37,000 --> 02:18:39,000
All right, here we go.

2516
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:41,000
On to the next question.

2517
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:42,000
Question number two.

2518
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:45,000
You feeling good about that lead, SSJ 100 mass?

2519
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:46,000
I'm feeling great.

2520
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:47,000
All right, feeling great.

2521
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:50,000
Here we go to question number two.

2522
02:18:50,000 --> 02:19:00,000
THQ might have said that the Wii U has a horrible slow CPU, but Loki is on record saying that

2523
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:05,000
the Wii U has a horrible slow blank.

2524
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:14,000
THQ might have said that the Wii U has a horrible slow CPU, but Loki is on record saying that

2525
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:18,000
the Wii U has a horrible slow blank.

2526
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:24,000
Ding.

2527
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:25,000
Ding.

2528
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:26,000
Ding.

2529
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:31,000
I don't know if I can make this smaller now.

2530
02:19:31,000 --> 02:19:33,000
Has a horrible slow.

2531
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:34,000
Ding.

2532
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:35,000
I'll just.

2533
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:36,000
I'll do it live.

2534
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
No, you have to write the answer down.

2535
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:39,000
All right, fine.

2536
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:42,000
Or else Alan's going to come over there and say, you rigged it.

2537
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:43,000
You rigged it.

2538
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:49,000
Alan is the Mass Effect po-po, you know.

2539
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:50,000
All right.

2540
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:51,000
Right, Alan?

2541
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:53,000
All right.

2542
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Okay, here we go.

2543
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:55,000
Does that mean he's seasick?

2544
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:56,000
We have an answer.

2545
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:57,000
Shut up.

2546
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:00,000
We have an answer for MacDeft, so that means we are ready to go.

2547
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
SSJ 100, Matt, you have that answer in your mind?

2548
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:03,000
Yep, I do.

2549
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:04,000
All right, here we go.

2550
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:09,000
THQ might have said that the Wii U has a horrible slow CPU, but Loki is on record saying that

2551
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:12,000
the Wii U has a horrible slow.

2552
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
Rendering of tits slash boobs.

2553
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
Rendering of boobs.

2554
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:17,000
Tits.

2555
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:18,000
Okay, good.

2556
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:24,000
ActDeft says a horrible slow maker or company.

2557
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:25,000
He's saying Nintendo is slow.

2558
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:26,000
Get it?

2559
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:27,000
I get it.

2560
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:28,000
I get it.

2561
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:29,000
We'll see.

2562
02:20:29,000 --> 02:20:30,000
We'll see how that pays off.

2563
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:31,000
All right.

2564
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,000
Has a horrible slow dark soccer.

2565
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Boob jiggle.

2566
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Boob jiggle.

2567
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
Oh, that's really close.

2568
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:39,000
I'd say half a point.

2569
02:20:39,000 --> 02:20:40,000
That's really close.

2570
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:44,000
And I wouldn't even say that a slow boob jiggle would be a bad thing.

2571
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:50,000
Alan is the unofficial, I almost said Mass Effect Judge, as the unofficial match game

2572
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:51,000
judge.

2573
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:53,000
Do you think boob jiggle is a match with boob rendering?

2574
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:54,000
I will allow it.

2575
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
I will allow it.

2576
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
Two points for SSJ 100, Matt.

2577
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
No points for ActDeft.

2578
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:01,000
That's okay, ActDeft.

2579
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:02,000
That's okay.

2580
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
Rachel, a horrible slow.

2581
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:05,000
Booty.

2582
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:06,000
Booty.

2583
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:09,000
Booty and boobies are very different.

2584
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:10,000
Some people are tits.

2585
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:11,000
Some people are ass.

2586
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:13,000
So those are two different answers for sure.

2587
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:15,000
If we gave them one, we're not going to give them both.

2588
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:16,000
All right.

2589
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:17,000
Loki.

2590
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:25,000
Loki, you are on record saying the Wii U has a horrible slow.

2591
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,000
Adoption of online protocols.

2592
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:31,000
Adoption of online protocols.

2593
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:34,000
Good answer, but not a match.

2594
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:37,000
Has a horrible slow.

2595
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:38,000
Bacon grilling peripheral.

2596
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
Bacon grilling peripheral.

2597
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
A very good Loki answer, but not a match.

2598
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:46,000
No, we don't want a horrible bacon grilling.

2599
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:52,000
And I said the Wii U has a horrible slow ego.

2600
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:53,000
Ego.

2601
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:54,000
Not a match.

2602
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:55,000
Not a match.

2603
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:57,000
All right, so the score is two to zero.

2604
02:21:57,000 --> 02:21:59,000
ActDeft, you still have two questions.

2605
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:01,000
You still have two questions.

2606
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:03,000
You could tie it up easy if you get one on each of these.

2607
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:07,000
All right, here we go to question number three.

2608
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
Question number three.

2609
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:17,000
Rob was shocked to hear that the R4 cartridges were being banned everywhere.

2610
02:22:17,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Upon hearing of the latest ban, Rob shouted at Allen,

2611
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:27,000
quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of blank.

2612
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:36,000
Rob shouted at Allen, quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of blank.

2613
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
I don't even know what to say for this one.

2614
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:44,000
In my stash of, OK, I got one.

2615
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:48,000
Quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of blank.

2616
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
Loki says ding.

2617
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:51,000
Rachel's still thinking.

2618
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:52,000
Allen says ding.

2619
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:53,000
That's all right, Rachel.

2620
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:54,000
I know we just met earlier tonight.

2621
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
It might be hard to think of a way to razz me.

2622
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
She's looking around.

2623
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
What the hell is this guy like?

2624
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:01,000
It's all right.

2625
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:02,000
You can make something up.

2626
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:03,000
They'll never know.

2627
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:04,000
All right.

2628
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:05,000
Ding.

2629
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:06,000
All right, ding it is.

2630
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:09,000
All right, and I see a ding from actdeft.

2631
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:11,000
SSJ100, Matt, you ready to answer?

2632
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:12,000
Yeah, I got one.

2633
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:13,000
All right, here we go.

2634
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:16,000
Rob was shocked to hear that the R4 cartridges were being banned everywhere.

2635
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:25,000
Upon hearing of the latest ban, Rob shouted at Allen, quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of blank.

2636
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:29,000
Rob shouted at Allen, quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of blank.

2637
02:23:29,000 --> 02:23:35,000
Rob shouted at Allen, quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of blank.

2638
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:41,000
I'm going to go with a classic match game answer with non-silon-occupied Caprica.

2639
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:47,000
Non-silon-occupied Caprica in my stash of non-silon-occupied Caprica.

2640
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:53,000
I don't know how well that's going to go over with somebody who is brand new to the show tonight, but we'll see what happens.

2641
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:57,000
All right, actdeft says dating sims and hentai games.

2642
02:23:57,000 --> 02:24:03,000
You have to understand, there are so many people that are like, what does non-silon-occupied Caprica even mean?

2643
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:05,000
I can't even say it right anymore.

2644
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:06,000
It's an old-ass joke.

2645
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:07,000
It's a really funny joke.

2646
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:12,000
Like, it would have been just about as funny as if he said, in my stash of big black cocks, but he didn't.

2647
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:24,000
All right, anyhow, quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of...

2648
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:25,000
Dark Sakura?

2649
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:26,000
Big black cocks?

2650
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
Big black cocks!

2651
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:31,000
Oh, and I didn't let him change the answer.

2652
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:36,000
All right, quick, hide the... Did I really read your mind?

2653
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
All right, quick.

2654
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:43,000
What do you expect? Someone that was talking about, you know, drawings of vaginas earlier.

2655
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:45,000
That's true, that's true. She's got porn on the...

2656
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:50,000
It sounds like actdeft's answer of dating sims and hentai games almost was a match there.

2657
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
Dating sims and hentai games.

2658
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:56,000
All right, Rachel, my stash of...

2659
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:57,000
Twilight books.

2660
02:24:57,000 --> 02:25:02,000
Twilight books? Get out!

2661
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:05,000
I don't own Twilight books. You made that up.

2662
02:25:05,000 --> 02:25:08,000
I could have said Fifty Shades of Grey. Look on the bright side.

2663
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:09,000
That's true. All right, I'll give you that.

2664
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:12,000
Really? Does Rob look like a 14-year-old Mormon girl?

2665
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:15,000
Well...

2666
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:17,000
If only it were a TV show.

2667
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:21,000
All right, Loki, quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of...

2668
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:22,000
Cat pictures.

2669
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:26,000
Cat pictures! Good answer. Not a match.

2670
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:30,000
Alan, quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of...

2671
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:33,000
New, still in box, President Cat merchandise.

2672
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:38,000
New, still in box, President Cat merchandise. Not a match.

2673
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:41,000
And my answer, the most important one, clearly.

2674
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:47,000
Quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of... Disney pins?

2675
02:25:47,000 --> 02:25:49,000
That's very accurate.

2676
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:52,000
I know. Sorry I played it straight on that one.

2677
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:55,000
All right. Womp womp. All right.

2678
02:25:55,000 --> 02:25:58,000
Act Deaf, it is still 2-0.

2679
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:01,000
Let's see, Shane is in chat. Shane Alinko in chat says,

2680
02:26:01,000 --> 02:26:04,000
I own the Twilight books and I'm not a 14-year-old Mormon girl.

2681
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:05,000
Yes, you are.

2682
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
You make me a very sad person on chat.

2683
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:10,000
Act Deaf says, fuck, I was gonna say President Cat.

2684
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
Woulda, coulda, shoulda.

2685
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:15,000
Dating Sims is a pretty good answer, though, even though I don't own any.

2686
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:16,000
All right.

2687
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
I have Dating Sims. They're yowie.

2688
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:21,000
Here's your chance to close the gap, Act Deaf.

2689
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:24,000
You feeling pretty good about this, SSJ100 Matt?

2690
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:25,000
I'm feeling golden.

2691
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:28,000
You're feeling golden. Here you go. One more question.

2692
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:31,000
Here we go. Last question.

2693
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:39,000
Peter Molyneux recently advertised Goddess on the Cube in Curiosity.

2694
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:47,000
It turns out that what Peter put inside the Cube is actually just an ad for blank.

2695
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:49,000
Blank.

2696
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:52,000
Y'all know Curiosity, what's in the Cube?

2697
02:26:52,000 --> 02:27:03,000
Well, Goddess was advertised on the Cube and it turns out what Peter put in the Cube is actually just an ad for blank.

2698
02:27:03,000 --> 02:27:07,000
What is in the Cube is actually just an ad for blank.

2699
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
Ding in a major way.

2700
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:11,000
Ding.

2701
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:13,000
Ding.

2702
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,000
Ding.

2703
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:19,000
Yes, I did. In a major way. Way to listen, Rob.

2704
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
I wasn't listening to you because I was thinking of an answer.

2705
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:25,000
Even though I think of the questions before the show, I don't think of the answers.

2706
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:28,000
You know what? That's a likely story. I don't believe you.

2707
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:31,000
All right. An ad for blank.

2708
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:36,000
All right. Looks like Act Deaf is Ding and SSJ100 Matt, you ready with an answer?

2709
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:37,000
Yep.

2710
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:41,000
All right. Peter Molyneux recently advertised Goddess on the Cube in Curiosity.

2711
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:47,000
It turns out that what Peter put in the Cube is actually just an ad for...

2712
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:48,000
Ovaltine.

2713
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:52,000
Ovaltine.

2714
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:55,000
I like Ovaltine.

2715
02:27:55,000 --> 02:27:56,000
That's great.

2716
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
That's a far better answer than you guys deserve.

2717
02:27:58,000 --> 02:27:59,000
That is true, yes.

2718
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:03,000
All right. Well, let's go to Act Deaf. He has an answer too, you know.

2719
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:07,000
What he put in the Cube is actually just an ad for...

2720
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:13,000
Hoping that we'll be ready to self-promote here on OLR tonight.

2721
02:28:13,000 --> 02:28:16,000
So an ad for the VoG network in the Cube. Let's take a look.

2722
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:17,000
DarkSakura.

2723
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:21,000
What he put in the Cube is actually just an ad for...

2724
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:22,000
Propel.

2725
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:23,000
Propel.

2726
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
I'm going old school tonight.

2727
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:29,000
Oh, you guys and the references. All right. Good answer. Not a match.

2728
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:33,000
All right. What Peter put in the Cube is actually just an ad for...

2729
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:34,000
Rachel?

2730
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
Goddess catch them all.

2731
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:39,000
Goddess catch them all.

2732
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:44,000
It burns, doesn't it? It's not a good burn.

2733
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:49,000
Ladies and gentlemen, who knew that Rachel was the 24th Magus, everybody?

2734
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,000
Here in studio.

2735
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:53,000
I will explain this to you.

2736
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:56,000
Yeah, you'll have to explain that later. All right.

2737
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:59,000
Is she going to break a soundboard table now?

2738
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:00,000
She might.

2739
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:03,000
I don't know. This table's a lot sturdier than the one that Drew broke.

2740
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:07,000
After nobody matches her, she might just flip the table over. We'll see.

2741
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:12,000
All right, Loki, what Peter put in the Cube is actually just an ad for...

2742
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:16,000
You know, I don't know how to pronounce this, but I'm going to try to. It's...

2743
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:17,000
Schrodinger.

2744
02:29:19,000 --> 02:29:21,000
Would it be Schrodinger or Schrodinger's cat?

2745
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:25,000
No. Everyone likes cats, so it's just Schrodinger.

2746
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:27,000
See how he likes it!

2747
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:33,000
Clever answer. That's too intellectual for you, Loki. All right.

2748
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:36,000
Should I have said penises or like, you know...

2749
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:39,000
You are a Mensa member after all. All right.

2750
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,000
It is just an ad for...

2751
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:42,000
Alan?

2752
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:45,000
Pure unsubstantiated hype the video game.

2753
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:49,000
Pure unsubstantiated hype the video game.

2754
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
You know, that's not as good as they say.

2755
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:57,000
All right. And lastly, my answer, we'll see if it's a match for Act Deft with the VOG Network or...

2756
02:29:57,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Whatever Matt said, I can't even remember now.

2757
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:01,000
Ovaltine.

2758
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:02,000
Ovaltine.

2759
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:08,000
Here it is. Peter Molyneux recently advertised Goddess on the Cube in curiosity.

2760
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:13,000
It turns out that what Peter put in the Cube is actually just an ad for...

2761
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:14,000
Douche.

2762
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:16,000
Good night, everybody!

2763
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:21,000
That's gonna conclude the match game tonight.

2764
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:24,000
SSJ 100 Matt wins!

2765
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
In a score of 2 to 0.

2766
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
Alan, 2 to 0.

2767
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:31,000
All right.

2768
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:37,000
Act Deft, thank you so much for playing, but sorry you're a loser. There's the door.

2769
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:41,000
SSJ 100 Matt, congratulations. You win.

2770
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:46,000
And as the winner, you get to pimp or promote anything you want to on the program tonight.

2771
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:52,000
Well, I don't really have anything to promote, so I'm just gonna promote the VOG Network.

2772
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:57,000
Oh, it's like the ad was really in the center after all.

2773
02:30:57,000 --> 02:30:58,000
All right.

2774
02:30:58,000 --> 02:30:59,000
Feel the love.

2775
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:00,000
You're so nice.

2776
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
Oh, the feels. The feels. All right.

2777
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:03,000
All the feels.

2778
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:09,000
SSJ 100 Matt, congratulations. You won the first match game on OLR in like a year and a half, so walk away with that trophy.

2779
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:12,000
And maybe somebody will try to take it from you in 2013.

2780
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:13,000
We'll see.

2781
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:15,000
All right. Have a good night, buddy.

2782
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:16,000
Have a good night, guys.

2783
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:17,000
All right. Bye.

2784
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,000
All right. That was fun. That was fun.

2785
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:24,000
Thank you, Alan, for walking in and doing a cameo. Not like I pressured you into it or anything.

2786
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:25,000
You're welcome.

2787
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:28,000
By the way, the taquitos were A+. Thank you.

2788
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
It was quite delicious. Thank you.

2789
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
Alan takes good care of us during the show. We appreciate it.

2790
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:33,000
All right.

2791
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:34,000
All right.

2792
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:37,000
Let us move on with a few more stories.

2793
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:43,000
And then we're going to open up the Skype line for regular calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2794
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:46,000
Or, of course, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

2795
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:53,000
Oh, we have more stuff we've got to get to before we get to the stories, though, such as the mailbag.

2796
02:31:56,000 --> 02:32:00,000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us your e-mails.

2797
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:04,000
And DarkSakura will dive into the mailbag headfirst and read a few e-mails that tickles your fancy.

2798
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.

2799
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:07,000
Okay.

2800
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
What's inside the mailbag?

2801
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:10,000
Cock.

2802
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:11,000
Okay.

2803
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:12,000
Um, have you...

2804
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:17,000
Okay, this comes from Alex. I'm just going to say Alex.

2805
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:22,000
Have you ever tried placing your games in a numbered list and picking a number at random?

2806
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:29,000
I've been surprised on many occasions to find out how much fun I've had playing an old game or playing a game I thought I was not in the mood for, thanks to this method.

2807
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:31,000
One more thing.

2808
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:34,000
MMORPGs get a number for each character.

2809
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:36,000
Okay.

2810
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
Take care and happy gaming.

2811
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:39,000
I've never done that.

2812
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:40,000
No, I get what he's saying.

2813
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:45,000
He's saying, like, you know, for the MMOs you play, give a number to each of your characters and throw them in the mix.

2814
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:48,000
For the record, making something plural, you do not use an apostrophe.

2815
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:49,000
Stop.

2816
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:50,000
You know what?

2817
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
I think it's a neat idea, actually.

2818
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
I think the idea is, like, really rad.

2819
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:59,000
Can you imagine if you had a spreadsheet of every game in the vault, one through, like, a thousand?

2820
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:06,000
We tried this and got so wiped out trying to list every freaking game that we own that, no.

2821
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
It spread out to imaginary numbers.

2822
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
There was algebra involved and it wasn't pretty.

2823
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:15,000
You had to use the E plus 10 and all that stuff to get the games in there.

2824
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:16,000
I think it's a great idea.

2825
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:19,000
Like, I think that would make an awesome, like, marathon idea.

2826
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:23,000
Like, you know, I know, OLR, we've been teasing the idea of doing a marathon for, like, ten years.

2827
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:29,000
But I think it would be great to, like, number all the games in the vault and then have our donators pick a random number.

2828
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:31,000
And that would be the game we'd be forced to play.

2829
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:33,000
Wouldn't that be fun, DarkSagra?

2830
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:34,000
Yes.

2831
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:35,000
Like, can you imagine if somebody-

2832
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:37,000
As long as we don't put shit on the list.

2833
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:38,000
Or, like, ET?

2834
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:40,000
Do you own ET?

2835
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:42,000
I think I do, actually.

2836
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:43,000
Now, here's the other question.

2837
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
Would each copy of Space Harrier get a number?

2838
02:33:47,000 --> 02:33:48,000
All right.

2839
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:49,000
Next email.

2840
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:51,000
Next up.

2841
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:53,000
Oh, that was the one I just read.

2842
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:56,000
They're very small.

2843
02:33:57,000 --> 02:33:59,000
This one comes from Will.

2844
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:04,000
I strangely enjoy when Rob breaks into the show to give the VoG passphrase.

2845
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:05,000
He sounds so serious.

2846
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:07,000
That's it?

2847
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:11,000
Today's password is cheeseball.

2848
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:12,000
That's not really the password.

2849
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:13,000
No.

2850
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:14,000
I don't pick that.

2851
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:15,000
The password-

2852
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:16,000
It's randomly generated.

2853
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:21,000
Yeah, the passphrases get picked for me after the show with a little thing that Bobby wrote.

2854
02:34:21,000 --> 02:34:23,000
Today's passcode is cock.

2855
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:24,000
No, it's not.

2856
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:25,000
Don't put that in the box.

2857
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:27,000
She doesn't know it, because we don't know it's allowed in the show.

2858
02:34:27,000 --> 02:34:28,000
What if the weapon did pop up?

2859
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:32,000
It's not going to have cock, because Bobby filtered all the adult words off of it, I'm sure.

2860
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:33,000
Aw.

2861
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:34,000
Dang it, Bobby.

2862
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:37,000
It'll be spelled with a zero and a five in place of the S.

2863
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:38,000
For April-

2864
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:39,000
You know what, Bobby?

2865
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:40,000
Remind me.

2866
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:45,000
April Fool's Day next year, people who put naughty words in the box unlock a bar of soap trophy.

2867
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:46,000
Can we make that happen?

2868
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:47,000
All right.

2869
02:34:47,000 --> 02:34:48,000
Anyhow-

2870
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:49,000
You got four months to work on it.

2871
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:53,000
Here's a chance for me to re-pimp this, though, because we haven't talked about it in a while.

2872
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:58,000
If you listen to the shows live at vognetwork.com, you can check into the show as the show is

2873
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:02,000
happening and get your five vog points, which go for the loot.

2874
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
And what do vog points get you?

2875
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:05,000
Absolutely nothing.

2876
02:35:05,000 --> 02:35:06,000
It's just a fun-

2877
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
But what does Foursquare and Facebook check-ins give you?

2878
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
It's just a fun little game within a game.

2879
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:14,000
Someday, there may be more to come from it in 2013.

2880
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:17,000
We're throwing around ideas.

2881
02:35:17,000 --> 02:35:25,000
But for those that can't join us live, what we do is we put a passphrase somewhere in the show.

2882
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
You might have already heard it earlier in the show.

2883
02:35:27,000 --> 02:35:29,000
You might hear it still coming up.

2884
02:35:29,000 --> 02:35:31,000
It's always in a random point in the show.

2885
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:35,000
If you put that passphrase into a box you see on the front page of vognetwork.com,

2886
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:39,000
you can get those same five points that you would have got if you listened live.

2887
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:40,000
It's like you get the same credit.

2888
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:43,000
So please note, you can't get the five points twice.

2889
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:48,000
Although you still can check in just to register yourself as you listen to the podcast

2890
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
and you listen live just to see if there were any differences.

2891
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
But you don't get the extra points.

2892
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
But anyhow, we hope you'll play along.

2893
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
It's just a fun thing to do at vognetwork.com.

2894
02:35:56,000 --> 02:36:00,000
And we do look to adding some fun little note prizes.

2895
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:05,000
Like maybe the person with the most amount of points will get to program the station for a day.

2896
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:07,000
I'm throwing it out there.

2897
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:08,000
These aren't actual things.

2898
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:09,000
But we're looking at doing things like that.

2899
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:12,000
Translated to give Bobby a migraine for a day.

2900
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:18,000
And Tigerclaw and Act Deaf in chat remind us bragging rights is what you get.

2901
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:19,000
Bragging rights.

2902
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:23,000
I like note prizes like Marvel used to do where the people would just get a blank envelope.

2903
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:28,000
I think maybe in 2013 what we should do, especially since we're all getting into,

2904
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:31,000
like you're doing crocheting and all these different projects,

2905
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:36,000
we should give our leaderboard leader every month a homemade prize.

2906
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:38,000
That means I have to make it.

2907
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
No, no. It doesn't have to be you every time. You can do one.

2908
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
We can make something out of popsicle sticks.

2909
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
But remember, there's more than just us on VOG.

2910
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:45,000
Hello.

2911
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:47,000
It could be like one week.

2912
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:52,000
It could be maybe Brad from Pod Culture could send something homemade.

2913
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:53,000
This is what we should do.

2914
02:36:53,000 --> 02:36:55,000
Have a contest. It starts in January.

2915
02:36:56,000 --> 02:37:02,000
Whoever gets the top of a leaderboard the most times in the period of a year

2916
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
gets an orange beanie crocheted by me.

2917
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
That could be one of the prizes.

2918
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
No, I'm making this a contest.

2919
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:13,000
We need to talk about this off-air first.

2920
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:14,000
We've got to coordinate it with Bob.

2921
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:15,000
Bobby is the game master after all.

2922
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:17,000
He might be like, wait.

2923
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:18,000
So we'll talk off-air.

2924
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
But yes, we're going to keep enhancing the game.

2925
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:21,000
It's always in progress.

2926
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:22,000
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

2927
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
Always in beta, just like Gmail.

2928
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
Last email.

2929
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:29,000
This comes from Travis.

2930
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:31,000
Donovan?

2931
02:37:31,000 --> 02:37:33,000
No, not Donovan.

2932
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:34,000
Hey, gang.

2933
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:35,000
Haven't wrote or called in a while.

2934
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:38,000
Thought I would drop a line and say, hey, I got a Wii U over the weekend

2935
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
and heard Rob talking about his last episode.

2936
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
I'm happy with it so far.

2937
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:47,000
I have an 8-Yo, sorry, year-old, and he absolutely loves it.

2938
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:50,000
Also, friends and family have a blast with it too.

2939
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:54,000
Just wondering, after a week of having it, what do you think?

2940
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
Rob, get out of the fridge.

2941
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:57,000
Come answer the question.

2942
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:58,000
I wanted an Oreo.

2943
02:37:58,000 --> 02:37:59,000
I want an Oreo.

2944
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:00,000
Thank you.

2945
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:03,000
You want an Oreo too, Rachel?

2946
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:04,000
I'll get you an Oreo later.

2947
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:05,000
I'm good.

2948
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:06,000
All right.

2949
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:09,000
Well, I talked about the Wii U at the top of the show.

2950
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
I don't think I have a lot else to add.

2951
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:14,000
I am not disappointed with my investment.

2952
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:19,000
But, again, how important is Mario and Nintendo Land

2953
02:38:19,000 --> 02:38:20,000
and some of these like ZombiU?

2954
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
How important are those games to you?

2955
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:25,000
If you think you can wait on those games until 2013, then wait.

2956
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:27,000
But if you want to play them now,

2957
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:30,000
and you have the financial resources available to play them now,

2958
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:31,000
then go get one.

2959
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:32,000
It's fun.

2960
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:34,000
Keep talking.

2961
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:37,000
No, I'm done.

2962
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:38,000
That's all I have to say on the Wii U.

2963
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
I talked for like 40 minutes during part A.

2964
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:41,000
Okay.

2965
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:44,000
Oreos from the fridge are the best.

2966
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:45,000
Okay.

2967
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:46,000
Matt, you want one?

2968
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:47,000
No.

2969
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
I do not want an Oreo.

2970
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:53,000
I'm pretty excited about Lego City, a new Zelda, and an F-Zero game.

2971
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
Being a PlayStation fanboy and a PC gamer,

2972
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:59,000
I have to say I'm not blown away, but still very impressed with it.

2973
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:00,000
Those are all in caps.

2974
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:01,000
How am I supposed to emote that?

2975
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
Oh, by the way, my friend requested you,

2976
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
but we'll have to do it again under a different name.

2977
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
Long story short, I had to get a replacement system

2978
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
as my first one I purchased was faulty.

2979
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:12,000
Quoty.

2980
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:13,000
Faulty.

2981
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:15,000
That sucks.

2982
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
You had some bad luck.

2983
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:18,000
Done.

2984
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:26,000
Jason is quick to correct me in the chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

2985
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:29,000
Gmail hasn't been in beta for more than a few years now.

2986
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:30,000
Whatever.

2987
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:34,000
We've been in beta for like, what, eight months?

2988
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
Gmail was in beta for like six years.

2989
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:39,000
We have a ways to go.

2990
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:40,000
Hyperbole what now?

2991
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:43,000
All right.

2992
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:46,000
Let's get into the FUs of the week.

2993
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:01,000
This is fucked up.

2994
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
Now Rachel, since you're new to the FUs of the week,

2995
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
I don't know if Jamie told you about this in the car ride,

2996
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
but this is the part of the show where we just get to,

2997
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:09,000
we just get to rant.

2998
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:10,000
Why?

2999
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
Well, because we have your attention.

3000
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
And when I have your attention, I like to rant.

3001
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:15,000
So it's the FUs of the week.

3002
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:16,000
Uh, Dersogra.

3003
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
I don't particularly have an FU.

3004
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:21,000
Um, I have a thank you to someone for saving me the trouble

3005
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
of doing what I planned on doing anyway.

3006
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:26,000
Hiding a body?

3007
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:28,000
No.

3008
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:29,000
All right.

3009
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:30,000
Uh, Loki.

3010
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:33,000
I have to do the whole ride over here because for some reason,

3011
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:36,000
like everybody was out to try to kill me or something on the road.

3012
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:39,000
Like there's a dude, I hate it when they do this.

3013
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
Like when there's people waiting to like pull out of an,

3014
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:46,000
either like a plaza or like a driveway or something like that.

3015
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:49,000
And they're like kind of trying to time it so that they just pull out

3016
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:53,000
right after you pass, except they have no sense of timing whatsoever.

3017
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
So it's like, oh, hey, you're coming.

3018
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:56,000
I'm backing out right now.

3019
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:59,000
You know, and you have to dive into the other lane.

3020
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:01,000
So I had that happen twice on the way here.

3021
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:05,000
And then there was, um, what was the other dude?

3022
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
Oh, some other dude that was drifting into my lane.

3023
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:10,000
It's just paying fucking attention, people.

3024
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:13,000
Seriously, you're going to kill somebody and hopefully not me.

3025
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:18,000
Uh, my FU of the week goes to Oreos for being so delicious and addicting.

3026
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:19,000
Oh my God.

3027
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
But no, the other thing about that is I want to give an FU to the fact

3028
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:25,000
that I never got to have the birthday cake Oreos because they disappeared

3029
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:29,000
from shelves so fast and, and real problems, guys.

3030
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
I never got to have the candy corn Oreos because they disappeared

3031
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
from shelves so fast.

3032
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
Why can't I make these special Oreos if I can't find them?

3033
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:39,000
And while I'm at it, FU to the fact that there are no pumpkin kisses

3034
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:40,000
this, this year.

3035
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
That is a travesty.

3036
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:44,000
True travesty.

3037
02:41:44,000 --> 02:41:47,000
Didn't you hold on to like a pack of those for like six months?

3038
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
I did, and they were still delicious.

3039
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:50,000
Sorry, not sorry.

3040
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
I, I partook of them too.

3041
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
eBay changed their logo.

3042
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
Yeah, like months ago.

3043
02:41:56,000 --> 02:42:00,000
Yeah, but I looked at eBay and fuck.

3044
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:01,000
All right.

3045
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
And last but not least, Rachel, do you have any FUs you want to get out?

3046
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:07,000
Uh, you know, I'd like to say FU to Michael Bay cause you know,

3047
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
you can never FU that guy enough.

3048
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
You know, on eBay, they are.

3049
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:12,000
That is a worthy first FU.

3050
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:13,000
Good job.

3051
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:14,000
Good job.

3052
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:17,000
You know, on eBay, they are selling those candy corn Oreos.

3053
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:18,000
Fuck eBay.

3054
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:21,000
And limited edition, like 15 bucks.

3055
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:26,000
Brad from Pod Culture says, Rob Roberts, try the gingerbread Oreos.

3056
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
They have gingerbread Oreos.

3057
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
I need this in my life.

3058
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:31,000
Ermahgerd.

3059
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:32,000
I need this in my life.

3060
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:35,000
Ermahgerd.

3061
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
Let's go to some more stories.

3062
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:38,000
I need a cat in my life, Rob.

3063
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:43,000
And then you at 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

3064
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:44,000
Loki.

3065
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:51,000
So, the studio that puts out Football Manager 2013 says that, you know,

3066
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:58,000
their efforts to stop piracy by adding DRM has actually benefited them.

3067
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:05,000
They are saying that, you know, Football Manager 12 was pirated within the first two weeks of its release.

3068
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:09,000
However, because, you know, not day one cause of their DRM.

3069
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:18,000
They said, though, that the extra sales that they got at the time had helped them have new staff members for this year's release for Football Manager 13.

3070
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:26,000
And, you know, had they been pirated day one, they probably wouldn't have the money to have the extra staff.

3071
02:43:26,000 --> 02:43:35,000
So, yeah, right now, I guess the new game has a new DRM system and as of right now hasn't been cracked.

3072
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:38,000
Although, they haven't, I don't know when it came out.

3073
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:45,000
And they said that if they can hold on for three or four more weeks, then it'll really benefit retailers and themselves.

3074
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:49,000
Is it working?

3075
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:58,000
I mean, it's good when it works in the effort to, you know, get people to actually legitimately buy your copies of your games.

3076
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:07,000
However, when you have it implemented in a way like Ubisoft does, where it hurts the actual consumers that buy your games and kind of punishes them.

3077
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:11,000
Whereas, you know, the person that has the cracked copy has no issues and that's the problem.

3078
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,000
So, you just kind of have to find that happy medium in there.

3079
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:21,000
I kind of think it's interesting how they talk about that like, you know, as long as we can hold off like three weeks before we get cracked, then we'll be good.

3080
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
We'll still sell a lot of copies of the game.

3081
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:29,000
I find it interesting that they just kind of give in to the fact that like, yeah, hackers gonna hack, they're gonna get into the game eventually.

3082
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:36,000
But, it also, you know, that mentality that the majority, the vast majority of games are in their first week.

3083
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:43,000
So, I find it very interesting that it's like, as long as we can hold off to week three, enough people will have bought it by then, whatever, at that point.

3084
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
Very interesting.

3085
02:44:46,000 --> 02:44:48,000
But, yeah, I also agree with what Loki said.

3086
02:44:48,000 --> 02:44:53,000
As long as, you know, anti-piracy, you gotta do what you gotta do, but as long as it works.

3087
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:58,000
So, alright, moving on to one more story tonight.

3088
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:06,000
I can't believe this, but if you're in Finland, you've got some weird taste, that's all I gotta say.

3089
02:45:06,000 --> 02:45:08,000
No offense, but you guys have some weird taste.

3090
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
Does it say panties?

3091
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:13,000
No, well, yes, but it means something different in Finnish.

3092
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:19,000
Anyway, she's referring to what is written on the can for Angry Birds Soda.

3093
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:22,000
You know, Angry Birds has been licensed for everything.

3094
02:45:22,000 --> 02:45:28,000
I'm sure there's Angry Birds diapers at this point and whatever, even here in America.

3095
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:33,000
But, over in Finland, they have Angry Birds Soda, and here's the crazy thing about it.

3096
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:39,000
It's actually outselling Coke and Pepsi in Finland.

3097
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
What?

3098
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
Alright, then.

3099
02:45:44,000 --> 02:45:50,000
Peter Vesterbakka from Rovio says that the soda will make its way to Australia and New Zealand in the near future.

3100
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:55,000
And they say it will probably come to the US eventually as well.

3101
02:45:55,000 --> 02:46:00,000
So, could Angry Birds someday outsell Coke and Pepsi here in America?

3102
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:02,000
I can only hope it's smelt flavored.

3103
02:46:02,000 --> 02:46:04,000
In Alabama, everything is a Coke.

3104
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:06,000
It doesn't matter what drink it is, it's Coke.

3105
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:07,000
So, I doubt it.

3106
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
Unless you're in the Midwest, then it becomes pop.

3107
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:10,000
Everything's pop.

3108
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:11,000
Oh, I hate that.

3109
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:12,000
Oh, it's like nails on chalkboard.

3110
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:13,000
I hate pop.

3111
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:14,000
I hate...

3112
02:46:14,000 --> 02:46:15,000
Pop is what you do to bubblegum.

3113
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:16,000
Not soda.

3114
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:18,000
How about soda pop?

3115
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:19,000
No!

3116
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:24,000
Soda pop was the name of one of the boxers in the original Punch Out.

3117
02:46:24,000 --> 02:46:27,000
And that's where it stays.

3118
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:35,000
It's gonna be weird one of these days when Mario becomes less recognizable to Red Bird.

3119
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
Give the birds fucking names!

3120
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:38,000
I mean, seriously.

3121
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:39,000
They're just...

3122
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:43,000
It's gonna continue a trend of streamlining the shape and the name to the point where

3123
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:47,000
it's just gonna be a dot on the screen and it will be because it's, you know, spelling

3124
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
the entire word is tiring.

3125
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:55,000
The Skype line is now open at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is ORANGELOUNGERADIO,

3126
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
all one word.

3127
02:46:57,000 --> 02:47:01,000
Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, ORANGELOUNGERADIO, all one word.

3128
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
The Skype line is open.

3129
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:04,000
And there you go, Nintendo.

3130
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:08,000
Nintendo, you could totally rip off Angry Birds by creating Bullet Bills and then having,

3131
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:14,000
you know, its own game, you know, where you're just firing Bullet Bills and have them, I

3132
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:17,000
don't know, do something.

3133
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:19,000
You can combat this.

3134
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:22,000
Any last minute stories while we wait for some calls to come in?

3135
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:24,000
I'll get to the Twitters in a minute, but...

3136
02:47:24,000 --> 02:47:27,000
Yeah, actually there was a few things coming out of MineCon because that just happened

3137
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:28,000
this weekend.

3138
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:29,000
Oh, was that this weekend?

3139
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:30,000
Yes, it was.

3140
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,000
Oh, well hold that thought because we got a call coming in.

3141
02:47:32,000 --> 02:47:33,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

3142
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:34,000
Who's this?

3143
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:40,000
Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Launch Radio.

3144
02:47:40,000 --> 02:47:42,000
I think you're muted.

3145
02:47:42,000 --> 02:47:44,000
Hello, hello.

3146
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:46,000
One more time.

3147
02:47:46,000 --> 02:47:48,000
Oh, you got to call it.

3148
02:47:48,000 --> 02:47:49,000
Go one, two, three.

3149
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:50,000
All right.

3150
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:51,000
Let's try another call.

3151
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:52,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

3152
02:47:52,000 --> 02:47:53,000
Who's this?

3153
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
Hey, this is Duke Newcomb.

3154
02:47:55,000 --> 02:48:00,000
I was wondering what's your guys' favorite Thanksgiving item because I don't think it's

3155
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:02,000
been mentioned yet this episode.

3156
02:48:02,000 --> 02:48:07,000
Duke Newcomb wants to know what is everybody's favorite Thanksgiving item because we haven't

3157
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
mentioned it yet this episode.

3158
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:10,000
What a good question.

3159
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:13,000
I'm so happy it has absolutely nothing to do with video games, but we like to take a

3160
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:14,000
break once in a while.

3161
02:48:14,000 --> 02:48:18,000
What's more important than video games, Duke Newcomb?

3162
02:48:18,000 --> 02:48:19,000
Food.

3163
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:20,000
Food.

3164
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:21,000
That's the answer.

3165
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:22,000
What did you say?

3166
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:23,000
Never mind.

3167
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:24,000
You said what?

3168
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:28,000
I said what's more important than video games, Duke Newcomb?

3169
02:48:28,000 --> 02:48:29,000
Pie.

3170
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:30,000
No, the answer is pie.

3171
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
No, the answer is cocks.

3172
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:33,000
Yeah.

3173
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:34,000
All right.

3174
02:48:34,000 --> 02:48:35,000
All right.

3175
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:36,000
Let's go around and get everybody's...

3176
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:37,000
Sorry, my phone is going out.

3177
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:38,000
That's all right.

3178
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:39,000
That's all right.

3179
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:40,000
We'll go around and get everybody's answers here for you.

3180
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:43,000
So what is everybody's favorite Thanksgiving item?

3181
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:44,000
Dark Sakura.

3182
02:48:44,000 --> 02:48:45,000
Garrus.

3183
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:46,000
Cooked Garrus?

3184
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:47,000
No.

3185
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:48,000
Oh, cooked?

3186
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:51,000
Calibrated to a crisp brown...

3187
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:56,000
You know, it has to be actually the chocolate chip pumpkin pie that Becky helped me make.

3188
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:58,000
Chocolate chip pumpkin pie.

3189
02:48:58,000 --> 02:48:59,000
It was epic.

3190
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:00,000
All right.

3191
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:01,000
All right.

3192
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:02,000
Rachel.

3193
02:49:02,000 --> 02:49:03,000
Turkey skin.

3194
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:04,000
Wait, what?

3195
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:05,000
Duke Newcomb?

3196
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:09,000
Somebody has to claim the bacon-wrapped turkey.

3197
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
Yes, that's right.

3198
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:12,000
All right.

3199
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:13,000
That's just nasty.

3200
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:14,000
Swanson, yes.

3201
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:15,000
I'm sorry.

3202
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:18,000
And one more time, Rachel, because I got distracted by you.

3203
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:20,000
It's turkey skin.

3204
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:21,000
Turkey skin.

3205
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:25,000
You have to say it like that, because otherwise, what is even the point?

3206
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:26,000
All right.

3207
02:49:26,000 --> 02:49:27,000
Loki.

3208
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:28,000
Mashed potatoes.

3209
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:29,000
Mashed potatoes.

3210
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:30,000
Are we good mashed potatoes?

3211
02:49:30,000 --> 02:49:33,000
But the Swanson sounds awesome.

3212
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:34,000
All right.

3213
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:39,000
My answer is the pumpkin mousse dessert that Allen makes.

3214
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:43,000
And there might be some in the fridge right now for after the show.

3215
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:44,000
Just saying.

3216
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:45,000
So there you go.

3217
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:46,000
Those are our answers.

3218
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:51,000
What's your favorite Thanksgiving food, Duke Newcomb?

3219
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:52,000
Yams.

3220
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
Yams and pumpkin pie.

3221
02:49:54,000 --> 02:49:55,000
I don't know why.

3222
02:49:55,000 --> 02:50:02,000
It's just like they have this sweet yet sour kind of flavor, the way my grandma makes them.

3223
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
She puts a little bit of lemon juice in there.

3224
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:08,000
It's just like this thing that you don't have any other day of the year.

3225
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:09,000
And you always look forward to it.

3226
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:13,000
Just that one dish is worth the other 364 days.

3227
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
That's a really sweet, sentimental answer.

3228
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:20,000
But I can tell that you're an imposter, Duke Newcomb, because the real Duke Newcomb would have said,

3229
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:25,000
My favorite Thanksgiving food is kicking ass.

3230
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:26,000
No.

3231
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:28,000
His favorite Thanksgiving food would be bubble gum.

3232
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:30,000
He would be chewing it.

3233
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:33,000
The one day of the year he actually gets to chew gum.

3234
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:34,000
All right.

3235
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:37,000
Any other thoughts for the listeners before I let you go?

3236
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:38,000
No.

3237
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:40,000
Just happy holidays, you guys.

3238
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:42,000
And keep on listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

3239
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:43,000
I love this show.

3240
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:45,000
We will keep listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

3241
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:46,000
You too.

3242
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:49,000
I don't listen to this damn thing anybody else in the show says.

3243
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:50,000
I'm sorry.

3244
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:51,000
What's that?

3245
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:56,000
He said the listeners, not the people who are putting it out there, of course.

3246
02:50:56,000 --> 02:50:57,000
Not you guys.

3247
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:58,000
You guys are the hosts.

3248
02:50:58,000 --> 02:50:59,000
Fine.

3249
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:00,000
I'll stop listening.

3250
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:01,000
Seriously.

3251
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:02,000
Fuck those guys.

3252
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:03,000
All right.

3253
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:04,000
No.

3254
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:05,000
We really appreciate it, Duke Newcomb.

3255
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:06,000
Thank you.

3256
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:07,000
Thanks for the question and take care.

3257
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:08,000
Yeah.

3258
02:51:08,000 --> 02:51:09,000
Take care.

3259
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:10,000
Bye.

3260
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:11,000
You know what?

3261
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:12,000
It's fun to get a non-gaming question once in a while.

3262
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:16,000
It says politicians are the weeds of the galaxy for ten bucks.

3263
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:18,000
I want one.

3264
02:51:18,000 --> 02:51:19,000
1877 game OLR.

3265
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:22,000
Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

3266
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:23,000
So, MineCon, Loki.

3267
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:24,000
Yes.

3268
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,000
So, there's a few things from MineCon.

3269
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:31,000
First off, there's some details about patch update 1.4 or 1.5.

3270
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:34,000
And that's going to be called the Redstone update.

3271
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:36,000
It's supposed to be coming out in January.

3272
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:41,000
And some of the features they're going to be adding are analog Redstone switches,

3273
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:42,000
which is kind of cool.

3274
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:44,000
They're going to be doing some tweaks.

3275
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:46,000
They're going to have a new capacitor block.

3276
02:51:46,000 --> 02:51:50,000
Also, they're saying variable signal strength stuff,

3277
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:53,000
as well as some additions to the minecarts,

3278
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:56,000
ways to link minecarts together.

3279
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:58,000
Also, they're saying they're going to have a special block

3280
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:01,000
that's going to allow people to dump off cargo.

3281
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:04,000
It sounds like a lot of stuff that are kind of inspired by Tekkit,

3282
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:08,000
where they're going to have piping systems for you moving stuff to chests

3283
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:10,000
and that kind of thing.

3284
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:12,000
Pretty cool.

3285
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:17,000
And also some new Nether-based ore that I guess will be used to make capacitors.

3286
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:19,000
All right, let me hold that thought while we go to the phones.

3287
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:20,000
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio.

3288
02:52:20,000 --> 02:52:21,000
Who's this?

3289
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:25,000
This is the dead call again.

3290
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:26,000
I think you're muted.

3291
02:52:26,000 --> 02:52:27,000
Hello?

3292
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:28,000
Hello?

3293
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:30,000
Hello?

3294
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:31,000
Goodbye.

3295
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
Let's try another one here.

3296
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:34,000
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio.

3297
02:52:34,000 --> 02:52:35,000
Who's this?

3298
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:36,000
This is the one and only Ranma.

3299
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:37,000
Hey, Ranma.

3300
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:38,000
I'm a good runmer.

3301
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:41,000
Ermahger Uche.

3302
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:43,000
How you doing, Ranma?

3303
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:48,000
Alive, awake, stuffed, and full.

3304
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,000
Full of what?

3305
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:52,000
Ermahger Thanksgiving dinner.

3306
02:52:52,000 --> 02:52:58,000
What's your favorite Thanksgiving meal or Thanksgiving dish?

3307
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:00,000
Sweet potato pie.

3308
02:53:00,000 --> 02:53:01,000
Sweet potatoes.

3309
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:02,000
Oh, lovely.

3310
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:03,000
Sweet potatoes.

3311
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:06,000
Our Friendsgiving had mashed sweet potatoes.

3312
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:07,000
Good stuff.

3313
02:53:08,000 --> 02:53:10,000
So what's on your mind, buddy?

3314
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:11,000
Why'd you call?

3315
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:17,000
Well, first off, in response to talking about eating Oreos earlier, I can't eat one.

3316
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:19,000
It's considered cannibalism.

3317
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:21,000
Do not repeat the joke you made in chat.

3318
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:23,000
I don't want an explicit tag this week.

3319
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:25,000
I'll leave it just like that.

3320
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:27,000
All right.

3321
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:30,000
I know, this is a PG-13 podcast.

3322
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:31,000
Yes, yes, exactly.

3323
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:32,000
Well, what else is on your mind?

3324
02:53:32,000 --> 02:53:36,000
However, I'll allow you to say it if you get me that $65 Garris figure.

3325
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,000
Don't listen to her.

3326
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:43,000
You have to talk to my accountant right now, so yeah.

3327
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:47,000
So what's going on in your gaming world, Ranma?

3328
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:50,000
Not too much.

3329
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:53,000
The only game I've been doing has been on my tablet.

3330
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:57,000
And I was checking eBay on Saturday and I'm like, wow.

3331
02:53:57,000 --> 02:54:02,000
I really kind of feel bad for those people who sit on those long lines to grab a Wii U

3332
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:04,000
just to flip it because you know what?

3333
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:06,000
That was going to be me.

3334
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:10,000
I ain't got pity in the world for those people.

3335
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:17,000
Even if you had done it yourself, Ranma, I would have said, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

3336
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:18,000
Hey, Ranma.

3337
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:19,000
Yes.

3338
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:20,000
Ha.

3339
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:27,000
Because the most expensive one I saw was $405 with 70 bids.

3340
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:28,000
Wow.

3341
02:54:28,000 --> 02:54:36,000
Well, I mean, it's just either people are resisting or it's not that hard to come by right now.

3342
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:40,000
You can still find basics on shelves in some places and some people are just saying,

3343
02:54:40,000 --> 02:54:43,000
you know what, I'd rather buy a basic than buy from an eBay flipper.

3344
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:44,000
I know.

3345
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:52,000
And I remember during the whole Wii U sales, they were going as high as $2,500, $3,000.

3346
02:54:52,000 --> 02:55:02,000
And I saw ads where you would get Wii, all the released games, 5.1 surround sound system, 50 inch LCD TV.

3347
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:07,000
I'll dress up as Santa and bring it to your house and deliver it for your kids on Christmas day.

3348
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:10,000
Good lord, how much did that go for?

3349
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:13,000
Those were going as high as $3,000.

3350
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:16,000
That's not a bad deal for all that shit.

3351
02:55:16,000 --> 02:55:20,000
I expect to see something like that run the holidays for the Wii U.

3352
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:24,000
Rama, will you dress up as Santa and come over to my house and give out the presents?

3353
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:29,000
Does it come with full release?

3354
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:30,000
Wow.

3355
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:37,000
Does my visit from Santa come with a happy ending?

3356
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:40,000
Rob, that was bad and you should feel bad.

3357
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:42,000
I do.

3358
02:55:42,000 --> 02:55:43,000
It ain't black Santa.

3359
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:48,000
It's Mary Kwanzaa, fool.

3360
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:52,000
I pity the fool that don't like candles.

3361
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:53,000
How's that?

3362
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:54,000
Close enough.

3363
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:56,000
It's time for me to wear my Mary Kwanzaa bitches shirt again.

3364
02:55:56,000 --> 02:56:01,000
How about I send you over to Jamie's house on Christmas because that would be hilarious.

3365
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:07,000
If you send me to Jamie's house for Christmas, I might not leave because you know she has that Southern cooking I love.

3366
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:09,000
You know I can do it too.

3367
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:15,000
I will make grits and mashed potatoes.

3368
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:28,000
I'm not going to totally advertise this to all the listeners everywhere, but Alan and I have been talking about starting a new Christmas tradition out of the one we started last year.

3369
02:56:28,000 --> 02:56:33,000
And that is taking our Jewish friends to Asian food on Christmas.

3370
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:34,000
That's right, we did that.

3371
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:35,000
We did that last year.

3372
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:37,000
We went out for pho, didn't we?

3373
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:40,000
Yeah, we didn't. So Alan and I want to extend that again this year.

3374
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:41,000
I'm down for that.

3375
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:43,000
We might try to get some other people to come along this year.

3376
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:44,000
We even sort of made a half joke.

3377
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:50,000
Two gay men and a Jew walk into a Vietnamese restaurant.

3378
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:53,000
It's a new sitcom. Two gay men and a Jew at a Vietnamese restaurant.

3379
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:56,000
I don't know the punchline, but there's one in there somewhere.

3380
02:56:56,000 --> 02:57:01,000
Jumas has been a long-timing tradition in my house for the last seven years.

3381
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:02,000
Chris Maquanzica.

3382
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:04,000
There you go.

3383
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:05,000
There you go.

3384
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:06,000
All right, Rama.

3385
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:07,000
I was calling it holiday mass.

3386
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:09,000
Mary Festivus to you.

3387
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,000
The rest of us.

3388
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:12,000
The rest of us.

3389
02:57:12,000 --> 02:57:15,000
If there's nothing else, then I'm going to let you go.

3390
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:16,000
Works for me.

3391
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:17,000
All right, take care, buddy.

3392
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:18,000
Later.

3393
02:57:18,000 --> 02:57:19,000
Bye.

3394
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:21,000
I'm telling you guys, the Oreo joke was really bad.

3395
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:23,000
All right, that's going to do it for the Skypline.

3396
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:25,000
We're running way over three hours tonight, so I'm going to wrap it up.

3397
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:27,000
Sorry to those that didn't get through, but if you didn't get through,

3398
02:57:27,000 --> 02:57:29,000
you should send us an email.

3399
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:32,000
Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

3400
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:35,000
Or you can always send us a tweet or any of that stuff.

3401
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:37,000
I want to let Loki finish up the last minute stories.

3402
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:38,000
All right.

3403
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:39,000
I've got to get to Twitter topics, too.

3404
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:40,000
One last thing.

3405
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:44,000
There was another app that was announced called Minecraft Reality.

3406
02:57:44,000 --> 02:57:48,000
It's an augmented reality app for iOS,

3407
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:51,000
and it can display 3D Minecraft images in the real world,

3408
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:53,000
and you can walk around them and stuff.

3409
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:56,000
It looked pretty cool from the little trailer that they had.

3410
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:58,000
You can check that out.

3411
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:01,000
It's two bucks to download.

3412
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:03,000
All right.

3413
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:05,000
I actually have a last minute story because this just finished

3414
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:07,000
while we were doing the show tonight.

3415
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:10,000
The Kickstarter for the Shadow Gate reboot has ended,

3416
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:12,000
and they made it.

3417
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:15,000
So the Shadow Gate reimagining is going to be happening.

3418
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:17,000
Which one?

3419
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:19,000
The one that we talked about.

3420
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:20,000
Oh, Shadow Gate. I'm sorry.

3421
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:22,000
Shadow Gate, not Shadow Run.

3422
02:58:22,000 --> 02:58:23,000
How many of those do they have?

3423
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:26,000
The old school NES game and Mac game from back in the day,

3424
02:58:26,000 --> 02:58:27,000
deja vu, et cetera.

3425
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:30,000
Not only did they make their $120,000 for the base game,

3426
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:33,000
but they made their first stretch goal of $130,000,

3427
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:36,000
meaning they're going to expand on the castle

3428
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:40,000
and add some rooms and puzzles, 15% more game.

3429
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:42,000
So pretty cool.

3430
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:46,000
Congratulations to the team there who make Shadow Gate.

3431
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:48,000
Let's get to the Twitter topics.

3432
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:50,000
I'm really excited about that Shadow Gate reboot, though.

3433
02:58:50,000 --> 02:58:53,000
Actually, that's only the second Kickstarter I've ever given to.

3434
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:56,000
So I've done GamerCon, and I did that one.

3435
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:58,000
So we'll see.

3436
02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:00,000
There's part of me that wants to give to the Molyneux project,

3437
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:03,000
but then I'm like, that guy is such a...

3438
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:06,000
The advertisement, again, really, really turned me off a little bit.

3439
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:08,000
All right.

3440
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:09,000
Let's see.

3441
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:13,000
Going to some tweets.

3442
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:15,000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

3443
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:17,000
ActDeft wants to remind us the Gold Nunchuck

3444
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:20,000
will make its return to Club Nintendo tomorrow.

3445
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:22,000
900 points for the Golden Nunchuck,

3446
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:24,000
because they need to get rid of them.

3447
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:26,000
I really need this in my life, Rob.

3448
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:27,000
You don't understand.

3449
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:28,000
What, the Golden Nunchuck?

3450
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:29,000
No.

3451
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:30,000
What?

3452
02:59:30,000 --> 02:59:33,000
The Garris figure that's...

3453
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:35,000
A sex doll.

3454
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:37,000
Hm?

3455
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:38,000
That's what?

3456
02:59:38,000 --> 02:59:39,000
A sex doll.

3457
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:40,000
No.

3458
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:42,000
It's...

3459
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:47,000
Someone linked it to me for cheaper.

3460
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:48,000
All right.

3461
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:49,000
And let's see.

3462
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:53,000
Moving on to the next tweet from Tigerclaw.

3463
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:55,000
Oh, I did read about this.

3464
02:59:55,000 --> 03:00:00,000
007 Legends studio Eurocom laid off a big chunk of its staff this week,

3465
03:00:00,000 --> 03:00:04,000
and he links us to a story I'm trying to bring up right now.

3466
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:08,000
The Eurocom studio, which is based in the UK,

3467
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:12,000
laid off the majority of its workforce as part of restructuring.

3468
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:14,000
The studio has been around since 88.

3469
03:00:14,000 --> 03:00:16,000
Yeah, they made a lot of games besides just this,

3470
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:17,000
but that's...

3471
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:20,000
They also did 007 Reloaded and then, of course, Legends,

3472
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:22,000
which wasn't very well received, unfortunately.

3473
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:25,000
Eurocom director Hugh Binns said that, quote,

3474
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:27,000
Eurocom are undertaking a restructuring,

3475
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:30,000
which I regret to say has meant we've made the majority of our workforce

3476
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:31,000
redundant today.

3477
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:33,000
That's the British word for laying off.

3478
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:37,000
This includes many very experienced, talented, and highly skilled employees,

3479
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:41,000
and we'd like to thank them all for your hard work and efforts.

3480
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:44,000
And they say this is because of the decline in the video game market.

3481
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:47,000
The studio had to cancel a number of projects.

3482
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:49,000
That sucks.

3483
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:53,000
And lastly, SSJ100Matt sends us a tweet about,

3484
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:56,000
we all know playing games while driving is a terrible idea,

3485
03:00:56,000 --> 03:00:59,000
but one game is trying to change that.

3486
03:01:00,000 --> 03:01:03,000
BrightDriver is what it's called.

3487
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:05,000
It's an iPhone app called BrightDriver.

3488
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:09,000
It's a platform that supports audio games people play in the car

3489
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:13,000
to keep their attention from lagging during long rides.

3490
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:16,000
It uses GPS functionality to keep track of the user's driving

3491
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:20,000
using metrics like speed, break rate, and stressful conditions like traffic,

3492
03:01:20,000 --> 03:01:24,000
and the games modify their pace appropriately.

3493
03:01:24,000 --> 03:01:26,000
That is crazy.

3494
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:30,000
That's kind of cool, like an audio game that you interact with.

3495
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:32,000
I want to hear more about this.

3496
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:34,000
I'll have to read the rest of the story for a future week,

3497
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:36,000
but that sounds kind of cool.

3498
03:01:36,000 --> 03:01:40,000
So that's it for the tweets tonight at twitter.com slash O-L-R.

3499
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:44,000
And this means we're at the end of the show.

3500
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:48,000
Rachel, thank you very much for coming to the show tonight.

3501
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:49,000
Thank you for having me.

3502
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:51,000
And sitting in. Come back any time.

3503
03:01:51,000 --> 03:01:52,000
I surely will.

3504
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:54,000
And we'll talk to you again.

3505
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:57,000
It may have taken you 480 episodes to get here,

3506
03:01:57,000 --> 03:01:59,000
but it doesn't look like we're going to go anywhere any time soon.

3507
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:01,000
Duke Nukem told us we need to keep listening,

3508
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:03,000
so I guess we're here for a little while.

3509
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:06,000
Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

3510
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:10,000
Yeah.

3511
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:11,000
Yeah.

3512
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:12,000
Quick plug?

3513
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:13,000
Sure, of course.

3514
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:15,000
Greetings from the wasteland at WordPress.

3515
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:19,000
I do creepypasta, and I do write about video games occasionally.

3516
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:21,000
There you go. Awesome.

3517
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:25,000
Um, Loki, any last thoughts, final thoughts from you tonight?

3518
03:02:25,000 --> 03:02:28,000
I just, I don't know.

3519
03:02:28,000 --> 03:02:31,000
Hopefully we'll be playing some Black Ops 2 multiplayer this week,

3520
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:33,000
aside from just, you know, myself and my coworker.

3521
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:34,000
Alrighty.

3522
03:02:34,000 --> 03:02:36,000
Uh, DarkSagra.

3523
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:39,000
Someone really needs to get me the Geras figure.

3524
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:40,000
I'm not even kidding.

3525
03:02:40,000 --> 03:02:42,000
Does it come with full release?

3526
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:46,000
Yeah, does it come with Tumblr rendered vajay?

3527
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:47,000
Alright.

3528
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:49,000
And, uh, my final thought tonight, as always,

3529
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:52,000
thank you all for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

3530
03:02:52,000 --> 03:02:55,000
If you enjoyed the show, please tell a friend or two or 20 about the show.

3531
03:02:55,000 --> 03:02:58,000
Help us spread the word, because we don't have any major websites behind us.

3532
03:02:58,000 --> 03:03:02,000
Or, I mean, we have the VoG network, but let's be real,

3533
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:05,000
it's not exactly a 1UP.com or a giant bomb.

3534
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:07,000
So, uh, you know, help spread the word.

3535
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:09,000
A website that generates revenue.

3536
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:10,000
Exactly, exactly.

3537
03:03:10,000 --> 03:03:11,000
It's a fun project.

3538
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:12,000
But you know what?

3539
03:03:12,000 --> 03:03:14,000
There are more great shows on VoG.

3540
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:15,000
It is not just us.

3541
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:17,000
There are lots and lots of great shows on VoG.

3542
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:20,000
Bobby Black Wolf before us, Sunday nights.

3543
03:03:20,000 --> 03:03:23,000
Uh, Understation Live on Saturday nights.

3544
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:27,000
Mondays are full of Pod Culture, British Invaders, and Critical Myth.

3545
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:30,000
Critical Myth, the hardworking guys, they're on three times a week on the network.

3546
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:32,000
Anime Jam session on Tuesday.

3547
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:35,000
Uh, Girls Gone Wow on Wednesday.

3548
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:37,000
And Horde House, they're okay.

3549
03:03:37,000 --> 03:03:38,000
Also on Wednesday.

3550
03:03:38,000 --> 03:03:40,000
So, there you go, yes.

3551
03:03:40,000 --> 03:03:42,000
As Black Wolf says in chat, VoG network.

3552
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:44,000
It's a website.

3553
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:46,000
That's a good final thought.

3554
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:48,000
It's a website.

3555
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:49,000
We'll see you next time.

3556
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:51,000
On our website.

3557
03:03:51,000 --> 03:03:52,000
Have a good night, everybody.

3558
03:03:52,000 --> 03:03:53,000
Bye.

3559
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:57,000
You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

3560
03:03:57,000 --> 03:04:02,000
Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.

3561
03:04:02,000 --> 03:04:04,000
To join us for a live show,

3562
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:11,000
tune in to VoGnetwork.com, Sunday nights at 6 p.m. Pacific, 9 p.m. Eastern.

3563
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:16,000
The views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect

3564
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:20,000
those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or VoG network,

3565
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:23,000
but you know they were all still true.

3566
03:04:23,000 --> 03:04:25,000
See you next week.

3567
03:04:34,000 --> 03:04:53,000
Thanks for watching!
