1
00:00:14,184 --> 00:00:19,627
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, November 25, 2012, could a new scaled-down Xbox 360 be on the way?

2
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:24,950
[SPEAKER_01]: Sony's credit rating is reduced, and Japan bans the sale of a controversial cartridge.

3
00:00:31,707 --> 00:00:36,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

4
00:00:36,851 --> 00:00:43,936
[SPEAKER_04]: It is Orange Lounge Radio live with this episode number 483 for November the 25th of 2012.

5
00:00:44,997 --> 00:00:52,963
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here to talk to you guys about video games and what's going on in gaming culture and so forth with my co-host.

6
00:00:53,343 --> 00:00:56,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello first off to the one, the only, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

7
00:00:56,846 --> 00:00:58,267
[SPEAKER_10]: You should really watch where that glass is.

8
00:00:58,987 --> 00:01:00,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, with the mic cords and everything?

9
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:04,731
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't want to knock it off and then onto your knee and have you curse loudly.

10
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:07,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Although that might have been funny, but it would have been very poor radio.

11
00:01:07,112 --> 00:01:07,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

12
00:01:07,832 --> 00:01:09,253
[SPEAKER_04]: Broken glass going into my foot.

13
00:01:09,413 --> 00:01:10,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a good radio time.

14
00:01:10,994 --> 00:01:12,475
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but it would have been hilarious here.

15
00:01:12,855 --> 00:01:13,155
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

16
00:01:13,195 --> 00:01:13,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.

17
00:01:14,136 --> 00:01:15,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Heart, heart, heart, heart.

18
00:01:15,277 --> 00:01:17,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Also say hello less, or what is it?

19
00:01:17,898 --> 00:01:19,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Less than slash three.

20
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:20,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

21
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

22
00:01:23,761 --> 00:01:24,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

23
00:01:24,262 --> 00:01:24,882
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you, Loki?

24
00:01:25,102 --> 00:01:25,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

25
00:01:25,822 --> 00:01:26,182
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

26
00:01:26,343 --> 00:01:26,963
[SPEAKER_04]: What's new with you?

27
00:01:28,163 --> 00:01:28,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Not much.

28
00:01:28,564 --> 00:01:29,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have a good holiday?

29
00:01:29,644 --> 00:01:30,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was fun.

30
00:01:30,585 --> 00:01:31,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Eat a lot?

31
00:01:31,565 --> 00:01:31,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

32
00:01:32,085 --> 00:01:32,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

33
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:32,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

34
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:36,528
[SPEAKER_10]: I read about the adventures of your child sitting under the tree eating spaghetti.

35
00:01:38,088 --> 00:01:39,029
[SPEAKER_04]: A spaghetti Thanksgiving?

36
00:01:39,528 --> 00:01:40,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Nelly posted something.

37
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:41,730
[SPEAKER_04]: How does that work?

38
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Or eating some food under the tree.

39
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:44,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe turkey?

40
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:45,735
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

41
00:01:45,835 --> 00:01:49,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, also say hello to the ever-present fourth guest in our chat room.

42
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:58,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Live.VogNetwork.com is the place to be where you can read comments such as Jason, who says, Rob sounds particularly more energetic tonight.

43
00:01:58,908 --> 00:02:01,131
[SPEAKER_04]: And Brad from PodCulture says, probably lots of coffee.

44
00:02:01,511 --> 00:02:02,051
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

45
00:02:02,231 --> 00:02:03,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, four cups today.

46
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:04,752
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

47
00:02:04,832 --> 00:02:05,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo-hoo.

48
00:02:05,552 --> 00:02:07,432
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we do have another guest joining us in studio.

49
00:02:07,973 --> 00:02:09,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody new to the show.

50
00:02:09,293 --> 00:02:12,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you believe there's still people in Sacramento who play video games who haven't been on this show?

51
00:02:13,954 --> 00:02:15,534
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do have somebody new to the show tonight.

52
00:02:15,554 --> 00:02:17,455
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you have a nickname you'd like to go by.

53
00:02:17,475 --> 00:02:19,055
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you want me to introduce you as tonight?

54
00:02:20,195 --> 00:02:22,196
[SPEAKER_12]: WordPress handle is Rakshasarani.

55
00:02:22,956 --> 00:02:24,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock Shas, are you a Kingdom Hearts girl?

56
00:02:25,177 --> 00:02:26,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that where Rock Shas comes from?

57
00:02:26,517 --> 00:02:28,618
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, it's Rock Shasa Rani.

58
00:02:28,658 --> 00:02:32,479
[SPEAKER_12]: It basically translates to Ogre Queen, but I'm sure it's improperly conjugated.

59
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:33,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's all right.

60
00:02:34,059 --> 00:02:35,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hello and welcome to the show.

61
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't expect me to be able to repeat that.

62
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:37,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I call you by your first name?

63
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:38,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, go right ahead.

64
00:02:38,901 --> 00:02:40,481
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to call you Rachel because that's what your name is.

65
00:02:41,102 --> 00:02:41,802
[SPEAKER_04]: So hi, Rachel.

66
00:02:41,842 --> 00:02:42,542
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the show.

67
00:02:43,222 --> 00:02:44,043
[SPEAKER_12]: Not Indian at all.

68
00:02:44,223 --> 00:02:46,265
[SPEAKER_12]: But we could go Rachel.

69
00:02:47,366 --> 00:02:50,548
[SPEAKER_04]: A good plug for your WordPress right at the top of the show.

70
00:02:51,609 --> 00:02:54,011
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way to sell your site here on Orange Lounge Radio.

71
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,653
[SPEAKER_04]: So, welcome to the show.

72
00:02:56,753 --> 00:02:59,215
[SPEAKER_04]: You and Jamie go to school together or something like that, right?

73
00:02:59,255 --> 00:03:00,697
[SPEAKER_10]: We slave away on the magazine together.

74
00:03:00,877 --> 00:03:01,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, good times.

75
00:03:02,038 --> 00:03:05,901
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and we're both kind of subbing on the other side pretty much.

76
00:03:06,421 --> 00:03:12,186
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I always felt more part of the writing process, but this year I'm on the design team, whereas...

77
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:15,549
[SPEAKER_12]: Jamie, who is an excellent designer, is now on the English side of it.

78
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:17,510
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so we're sort of crossed over.

79
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:23,695
[SPEAKER_10]: But that means we both see what goes on on each side and then go, what's up with that?

80
00:03:25,396 --> 00:03:28,158
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys are frenzies from school.

81
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:33,483
[SPEAKER_04]: So how did you guys, obviously you guys connected because you're both obviously geeky gals, which is great.

82
00:03:33,523 --> 00:03:34,303
[SPEAKER_04]: We love geeky gals.

83
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:36,285
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you guys kind of find that connection?

84
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:56,672
[SPEAKER_10]: through many rides home and series of conversations and yarn which I'm working on during the show again more crochet you were mentioning earlier that you are very experienced with yarn and all that stuff and she's a fantastic potter oh thank you

85
00:03:57,032 --> 00:04:03,498
[SPEAKER_12]: and that's really my only contribution to the yarn store is because my mother's more of a crocheter, my sister knits.

86
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:10,164
[SPEAKER_12]: I do these things called yarn bowls and basically it's just, you know, yarn accessories works out pretty well for me.

87
00:04:10,224 --> 00:04:15,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, all this talk about knitting and crocheting and pottery is going to go over great with our teen male audience, but...

88
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:17,210
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, boys.

89
00:04:19,491 --> 00:04:21,132
[SPEAKER_04]: I play games and I do pottery.

90
00:04:22,212 --> 00:04:23,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about games for a minute.

91
00:04:23,553 --> 00:04:24,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Do pottery, not pot.

92
00:04:25,774 --> 00:04:29,357
[SPEAKER_04]: We were talking a little bit before the show and you mentioned you have a love of Silent Hill.

93
00:04:29,777 --> 00:04:30,857
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yes, yes.

94
00:04:31,318 --> 00:04:33,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is very fond for us here at OLR.

95
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:35,320
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your favorite out of the series?

96
00:04:36,292 --> 00:04:38,733
[SPEAKER_12]: Ooh, it's kind of a toss-up.

97
00:04:40,493 --> 00:04:42,574
[SPEAKER_12]: I kind of like 3 and 4.

98
00:04:43,514 --> 00:04:47,215
[SPEAKER_12]: I love 4 for its story more than its gameplay aspects.

99
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:47,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

100
00:04:47,775 --> 00:04:49,455
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't hear a lot of people sticking up for 4.

101
00:04:49,615 --> 00:04:52,776
[SPEAKER_04]: I think 4 was better than people say it was.

102
00:04:52,936 --> 00:04:53,556
[SPEAKER_04]: It was intriguing.

103
00:04:53,616 --> 00:04:54,817
[SPEAKER_04]: But weird that you didn't say 2.

104
00:04:56,684 --> 00:04:57,184
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

105
00:04:57,224 --> 00:04:57,545
[SPEAKER_12]: Go with that.

106
00:04:57,565 --> 00:04:58,625
[SPEAKER_12]: What other games do you play?

107
00:04:58,705 --> 00:05:00,046
[SPEAKER_12]: What other games do you like?

108
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:00,887
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you a fan of?

109
00:05:14,435 --> 00:05:15,956
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been playing a lot of Portal recently.

110
00:05:16,897 --> 00:05:20,179
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I love Portal, but it's really on my four-year-old nephew's account, too.

111
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:26,104
[SPEAKER_12]: He's a huge fan of Portal, too, and that is literally the first thing out of his mouth any time he comes over to visit.

112
00:05:26,865 --> 00:05:29,888
[SPEAKER_12]: So I've got that pretty much, like, I could navigate that in my sleep.

113
00:05:30,488 --> 00:05:31,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice, nice.

114
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:32,690
[SPEAKER_04]: No wonder you and Jamie get along.

115
00:05:33,931 --> 00:05:37,354
[SPEAKER_04]: She would not shut up about Portal until she discovered Mass Effect.

116
00:05:38,593 --> 00:05:40,034
[SPEAKER_10]: So now I've got to get her... Oh, God.

117
00:05:40,075 --> 00:05:41,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Did she suck you into that, too?

118
00:05:41,676 --> 00:05:41,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Not yet.

119
00:05:41,976 --> 00:05:42,937
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been telling her about it.

120
00:05:43,117 --> 00:05:43,838
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got Becky.

121
00:05:44,058 --> 00:05:45,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Becky's already beaten the third game now.

122
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:47,381
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait a minute.

123
00:05:47,962 --> 00:05:49,143
[SPEAKER_10]: She's playing through Leviathan now.

124
00:05:49,463 --> 00:05:51,285
[SPEAKER_10]: Did Becky play a lot of video games before?

125
00:05:51,445 --> 00:05:51,686
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

126
00:05:52,026 --> 00:05:52,286
[SPEAKER_10]: None.

127
00:05:54,348 --> 00:05:57,631
[SPEAKER_10]: I should tell her that we're talking about her because she's actually making dinner for Julian right now.

128
00:05:57,811 --> 00:05:58,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

129
00:05:58,272 --> 00:06:02,276
[SPEAKER_10]: But she's like, I found out that the controllers are ergonomic.

130
00:06:02,376 --> 00:06:03,136
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't hurt.

131
00:06:03,156 --> 00:06:03,617
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

132
00:06:04,257 --> 00:06:06,359
[SPEAKER_10]: So she's been playing through everything on Xbox 360.

133
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I figured it out.

134
00:06:08,341 --> 00:06:13,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Mass Effect 3, or Mass Effect the series, is like Fifty Shades of Grey, but a different version of it.

135
00:06:14,147 --> 00:06:15,288
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Fifty Shades of Garrus.

136
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Fifty Shades of Garrus!

137
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:16,549
[SPEAKER_03]: A.K.A.

138
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:17,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Turian Peen.

139
00:06:21,574 --> 00:06:23,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Shade 1, calibrations.

140
00:06:23,996 --> 00:06:25,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Shade 2, more calibrations.

141
00:06:26,818 --> 00:06:28,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Shade 3, can you come back later?

142
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:29,580
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to do some calibrations.

143
00:06:31,801 --> 00:06:35,504
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but I'm actually super looking forward to Omega.

144
00:06:36,624 --> 00:06:37,565
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to play Mass Effect.

145
00:06:37,985 --> 00:06:38,786
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one's free.

146
00:06:39,086 --> 00:06:42,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com where you can participate.

147
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,374
[SPEAKER_04]: A supporter, Rachel, in the chatroom, Shayna Linko says, yay, someone else likes 4.

148
00:06:46,675 --> 00:06:47,495
[SPEAKER_04]: 4 was awesome.

149
00:06:48,136 --> 00:06:49,097
[SPEAKER_10]: 4 was pretty cool.

150
00:06:49,257 --> 00:06:52,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Shayna's a huge Silent Hill fan, so let's see.

151
00:06:52,421 --> 00:06:55,264
[SPEAKER_04]: And Actdeft, Portal is the most fun, Portal 2 is the best.

152
00:06:57,486 --> 00:06:58,107
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

153
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,132
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about the whole, you know, Shepard, Garrus.

154
00:07:19,332 --> 00:07:21,274
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like first contact with her butt, is it?

155
00:07:22,615 --> 00:07:24,797
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's Turian pain.

156
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:30,662
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway, she also did a series of drawings of what she thinks the vag of other species is.

157
00:07:30,922 --> 00:07:31,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

158
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,024
[SPEAKER_11]: Why, why, why?

159
00:07:33,525 --> 00:07:35,486
[SPEAKER_11]: Because inquiring minds want to know.

160
00:07:36,607 --> 00:07:39,350
[SPEAKER_10]: But the thing is, she's actually a super, super good artist.

161
00:07:41,656 --> 00:07:53,440
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's what she spends her talents on so her work is actually rather realistic and it would make like logical sense oh my god I can't did someone say portfolio?

162
00:07:55,461 --> 00:08:09,886
[SPEAKER_04]: anyhow let me bring up another random comment to try and stir this conversation in a different direction I'm going to bring up another game I know you told me about earlier Rachel Brad from PodCulture says ooh Steam has Arkham City for $7.50 that's another game series you said you were into right?

163
00:08:10,434 --> 00:08:11,055
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yes, yes.

164
00:08:11,135 --> 00:08:19,614
[SPEAKER_12]: As a matter of fact, first time I installed Arkham Asylum, I did one complete playthrough throughout two days because I didn't want to have to, you know...

165
00:08:21,348 --> 00:08:44,418
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah I installed it and then I didn't register it or whatever so I couldn't save it so I basically just played the thing for two days straight and then Arkham City came out I played that thing into the ground and like I'm you know I come from a family of completionists so it's like I was in there doing like every single Riddler challenge and oh my god I lost so much sleep it's like I could feel my eyes just ready to fall out of my skull.

166
00:08:44,438 --> 00:08:45,018
[SPEAKER_04]: But you did it!

167
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:46,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you do all the DLC too?

168
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,300
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, I'm saving those for a special occasion.

169
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you haven't really finished it.

170
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,681
[SPEAKER_12]: I know.

171
00:08:51,721 --> 00:08:52,521
[SPEAKER_12]: Twitch, Twitch, Twitch.

172
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:53,801
[SPEAKER_04]: I was trying to see if I could get her to Twitch.

173
00:08:54,282 --> 00:08:56,002
[SPEAKER_12]: Were you a fan of the comics before playing the game?

174
00:08:57,063 --> 00:08:58,143
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, not so much the comics.

175
00:08:58,223 --> 00:09:02,044
[SPEAKER_12]: I got into the games mainly because of the Cartoon Connection.

176
00:09:02,544 --> 00:09:03,845
[SPEAKER_12]: Kevin Conroy, awesome.

177
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:05,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, okay, the animated series.

178
00:09:05,696 --> 00:09:06,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

179
00:09:06,456 --> 00:09:10,257
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, him and Mark Hamill, they are basically Batman and the Joker for me.

180
00:09:10,437 --> 00:09:11,858
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all kinds of happies.

181
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,138
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of people on your team when it comes to that.

182
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:17,440
[SPEAKER_04]: So, awesome.

183
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,141
[SPEAKER_10]: I was mad at the DLC.

184
00:09:20,341 --> 00:09:20,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

185
00:09:21,441 --> 00:09:22,521
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't play all the DLC.

186
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:27,123
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know the thing with... Okay, the game's been out forever, so I'm just going to freaking say it.

187
00:09:27,563 --> 00:09:31,144
[SPEAKER_10]: About Harley... Jump ahead quick if you don't want spoilers.

188
00:09:31,164 --> 00:09:31,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Jump ahead.

189
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:32,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Mute for one minute.

190
00:09:32,825 --> 00:09:34,186
[SPEAKER_10]: about Harley's pregnancy test.

191
00:09:34,846 --> 00:09:38,248
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, like, in the DLC, there's, like, 20 bajillion of them that are all negative.

192
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:43,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they're trying to fix that for a possible third game or something, maybe.

193
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:48,214
[SPEAKER_12]: Except, like, there was the ending where she's singing a lullaby, so... Whatever.

194
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:55,579
[SPEAKER_12]: Or, you know, that would be, like, a defining character moment where she thinks she's pregnant, but she's really gone even crazier, so it's like a...

195
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:57,440
[SPEAKER_12]: Joker doll that she's calling her.

196
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,801
[SPEAKER_12]: I kind of like if it would move in that direction.

197
00:10:01,181 --> 00:10:01,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

198
00:10:02,462 --> 00:10:07,704
[SPEAKER_04]: She sounds like one of those crazy women, like the type that would draw vaginas of alien races and post them on her Tumblr.

199
00:10:07,724 --> 00:10:08,344
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

200
00:10:08,644 --> 00:10:10,165
[SPEAKER_10]: I linked the Tumblr in the chat room.

201
00:10:10,325 --> 00:10:10,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, great.

202
00:10:10,885 --> 00:10:11,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

203
00:10:11,386 --> 00:10:12,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for that.

204
00:10:12,546 --> 00:10:14,047
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure Loki's pulling it up right now.

205
00:10:14,987 --> 00:10:17,308
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

206
00:10:17,348 --> 00:10:23,451
[SPEAKER_10]: For the record, Rob, despite the comic being fairly graphic, it actually is very...

207
00:10:24,431 --> 00:10:24,952
[SPEAKER_04]: It's artsy.

208
00:10:25,012 --> 00:10:25,873
[SPEAKER_10]: It actually tells a story.

209
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:27,994
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll leave it at that.

210
00:10:28,034 --> 00:10:28,675
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll leave it at that.

211
00:10:29,055 --> 00:10:30,056
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

212
00:10:30,376 --> 00:10:33,299
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have to ask you before we move on to our real kickoff topic.

213
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:35,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Rachel, what's your gaming platform of choice?

214
00:10:36,061 --> 00:10:39,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a particular console you tend to play stuff on or are you more PC gal?

215
00:10:39,704 --> 00:10:40,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Where do you lean?

216
00:10:40,705 --> 00:10:41,185
[SPEAKER_12]: Shiznight.

217
00:10:41,866 --> 00:10:45,929
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I tend to gravitate towards PC just because I'm big on retro games and I

218
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:48,090
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of emulators available there.

219
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, I see.

220
00:10:49,131 --> 00:10:55,215
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but if you twist my arm and force me to pick, I'd have to go with a Nintendo console, just out of sheer loyalty.

221
00:10:55,906 --> 00:10:56,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, you're one of those.

222
00:10:57,067 --> 00:10:57,567
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just kidding.

223
00:10:57,688 --> 00:10:58,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm one of those.

224
00:10:58,648 --> 00:10:59,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki will love you!

225
00:10:59,509 --> 00:11:04,032
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want anything wrong with Nintendo consoles.

226
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:07,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, you know, the Wii U is just not worth the money.

227
00:11:08,396 --> 00:11:13,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll get into plenty more of that in a minute, but I did want to talk about some other kickoff topics here real quick.

228
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:19,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, we hope all you guys here in the States had a happy Thanksgiving holiday.

229
00:11:20,165 --> 00:11:21,946
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and around the world, hope you had a good week.

230
00:11:22,186 --> 00:11:22,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously...

231
00:11:23,707 --> 00:11:25,688
[SPEAKER_04]: retail madness over the weekend.

232
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:28,429
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of hate that that stuff is starting to eclipse Thanksgiving.

233
00:11:28,469 --> 00:11:30,730
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of people are growing very frustrated with it.

234
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:34,012
[SPEAKER_04]: But it is the time to get some good deals.

235
00:11:34,572 --> 00:11:37,393
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Steam sale, obviously, is another good place to get deals.

236
00:11:38,494 --> 00:11:42,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Civ V, which I never shut up about on this show, great deal going on right now.

237
00:11:42,655 --> 00:11:45,757
[SPEAKER_04]: I was really tempted to get Borderlands 2, which I know is on sale.

238
00:11:46,137 --> 00:11:50,099
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious if you guys picked up any gaming deals over these past few days.

239
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:50,899
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

240
00:11:51,319 --> 00:11:51,859
[SPEAKER_04]: What'd you get?

241
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,920
[SPEAKER_04]: What'd you get, DarkSakura?

242
00:11:53,631 --> 00:12:15,876
[SPEAKER_10]: I bought They Bleed Pixels and Awesome Knots And then I bought Dragon Age Origins, the Deluxe Edition through Origin Although I wish I had waited and just gotten it through Steam Because Steam was a penny cheaper One whole penny But I hate Origin, I prefer playing through Steam And then I actually just bought Sonic Generations on Steam Because it's eight freaking bucks And it's Sonic Generations

243
00:12:16,776 --> 00:12:19,679
[SPEAKER_10]: with a really screwed up last level, seriously.

244
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Because Dan and I sat and watched the whole playthrough.

245
00:12:24,163 --> 00:12:24,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

246
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:27,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Rachel, did you take advantage of any of the gaming deals this weekend?

247
00:12:28,067 --> 00:12:28,547
[SPEAKER_12]: I did not.

248
00:12:28,587 --> 00:12:33,592
[SPEAKER_12]: I was actually working through Black Friday, even though it wasn't really Black Friday-ish for our shop.

249
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:38,756
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I still saw a bit of ugliness, so I was more preoccupied with the working part of that.

250
00:12:39,017 --> 00:12:40,398
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's fair enough, fair enough.

251
00:12:40,438 --> 00:12:40,858
[SPEAKER_04]: It happens.

252
00:12:42,099 --> 00:12:49,786
[SPEAKER_04]: You brave, brave retail people that had to work those front lines on Friday, I don't envy you in the slightest, because people are crazy.

253
00:12:50,206 --> 00:12:56,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, I was telling you guys before the show, I went out on Black Friday at about 8 o'clock at night because we needed stuff from Target.

254
00:12:56,908 --> 00:12:57,629
[SPEAKER_04]: I needed shampoo.

255
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,910
[SPEAKER_04]: So we went to Target at 8 o'clock.

256
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:00,350
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fine.

257
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:04,351
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go out at night on Black Friday and after all the crazies have gone to bed, totally fine.

258
00:13:04,371 --> 00:13:05,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like any other day.

259
00:13:05,692 --> 00:13:09,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Even went to Fry's and got some upgrades for the studio I'll talk about in a minute.

260
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:12,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, did you take advantage of any deals?

261
00:13:12,294 --> 00:13:16,334
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought nothing because I have no money to buy things with.

262
00:13:16,414 --> 00:13:17,815
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what happens when you're a parent.

263
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:18,555
[SPEAKER_09]: You have no money.

264
00:13:18,615 --> 00:13:19,855
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's just being a parent.

265
00:13:20,295 --> 00:13:22,556
[SPEAKER_04]: You're also a homeowner and you just bought a new car.

266
00:13:22,856 --> 00:13:23,616
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a big one.

267
00:13:24,796 --> 00:13:25,176
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

268
00:13:25,196 --> 00:13:29,117
[SPEAKER_10]: I just feel like giving people crap for small reasons.

269
00:13:29,397 --> 00:13:31,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Congrats on the used car.

270
00:13:31,918 --> 00:13:32,658
[SPEAKER_03]: New to you car.

271
00:13:33,058 --> 00:14:00,605
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just um and also the other thing too is like the last steam sale i bought a bunch of games i still haven't played most of them and i haven't played most of the games that i got through my humble bundle so i'm just kind of like you know hey that's cool borderlands 2 is down to like 30 bucks whatever am i really gonna play it probably not so it's just you know kind of answering the question is this really something i'm going to play and a lot of times it's no i'm probably not going to play that so that's why i haven't really been buying anything

272
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:03,809
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't really buy anything either.

273
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,710
[SPEAKER_04]: I did buy another Wii U game when I was at Fry's picking up the new router.

274
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:15,292
[SPEAKER_04]: I got Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed for the Wii U just because some of my other friends had it and was giving it positive reviews.

275
00:14:16,012 --> 00:14:20,173
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only a deal because it's one of the two non-$60 games, I think.

276
00:14:20,733 --> 00:14:20,973
[SPEAKER_04]: I think 50.

277
00:14:21,634 --> 00:14:22,814
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 40, actually.

278
00:14:23,434 --> 00:14:25,274
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think I paid 40 for it.

279
00:14:25,314 --> 00:14:26,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I did get a deal and didn't realize it.

280
00:14:26,655 --> 00:14:27,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think I only paid 40 for it.

281
00:14:27,955 --> 00:14:31,856
[SPEAKER_03]: And I might have been a deal then because I think that was supposed to be like a $50 game.

282
00:14:31,876 --> 00:14:32,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I did get a deal!

283
00:14:34,197 --> 00:14:35,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I only paid $44 and I'm pretty sure.

284
00:14:35,758 --> 00:14:36,898
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty cool.

285
00:14:37,898 --> 00:14:40,939
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was one other game that was cheaper than the others.

286
00:14:40,999 --> 00:14:41,760
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember what it was.

287
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,961
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

288
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:10,734
[SPEAKER_10]: and I actually touched some WoW so you guys wouldn't kick me out of the guild.

289
00:15:12,015 --> 00:15:28,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Going back to Mass Effect in a minute I mean obviously you've talked tons about it on the show but I found the modding you were doing this week interesting because you were posting to our little rabid fan community we have on Facebook and you had like these different colored skinned shepherds like you went in and had like a green skinned shepherd and this weird stuff.

290
00:15:28,407 --> 00:15:33,211
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay I'll tell you where this came about is because and this is actually me using a little bit

291
00:15:33,271 --> 00:15:35,933
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm working on making a somewhat Middle Eastern looking shepherd.

292
00:15:52,723 --> 00:16:06,695
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've tweaked the eyes, I've tweaked the nose, and now I'm tweaking the skin tone, but it's either coming out like too much of a muted chocolate, you know, like the plain milk chocolate with no extra skin tone to it, nothing blushing, nothing under that.

293
00:16:07,396 --> 00:16:11,059
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I'm playing with blushes, I'm playing with all this, and then I had an idea.

294
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:17,705
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, well, if all of this is showing through whatever the skin is, can I make a Blue Shepard?

295
00:16:18,385 --> 00:16:19,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Blue Shepard

296
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:27,474
[SPEAKER_10]: It worked.

297
00:16:27,514 --> 00:16:28,735
[SPEAKER_10]: So then I did Red Shepard.

298
00:16:29,135 --> 00:16:30,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Then I did Green Shepard.

299
00:16:30,435 --> 00:16:33,316
[SPEAKER_10]: Then I did Yellow Shepard, which looks more like Puke Green Shepard.

300
00:16:33,516 --> 00:16:36,878
[SPEAKER_10]: But I could get it to work because I've gotten purple hair.

301
00:16:37,858 --> 00:16:38,538
[SPEAKER_10]: The hair works.

302
00:16:38,658 --> 00:16:43,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations for now fusing the fan communities of Avatar and Mass Effect.

303
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,781
[SPEAKER_03]: There already were blue people in Mass Effect, though.

304
00:16:46,861 --> 00:16:47,701
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't matter.

305
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:48,982
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need more blue people.

306
00:16:50,757 --> 00:16:51,778
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

307
00:17:15,301 --> 00:17:19,303
[SPEAKER_10]: and I've modified my coalesced INI to add extra outfits.

308
00:17:19,343 --> 00:17:21,004
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a naked skin for female Shepard.

309
00:17:23,105 --> 00:17:24,565
[SPEAKER_10]: However, she has no real butt crack.

310
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:27,947
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a naked one for the guys but I can't find it.

311
00:17:27,967 --> 00:17:30,108
[SPEAKER_10]: What is it with the girls and the nudity tonight?

312
00:17:31,068 --> 00:17:31,649
[SPEAKER_03]: It's no problem.

313
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:34,853
[SPEAKER_03]: You can fix that butt crack problem by just editing the texture.

314
00:17:34,893 --> 00:17:36,615
[SPEAKER_10]: There actually is an edited texture.

315
00:17:36,635 --> 00:17:37,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Buy her bigger panties.

316
00:17:37,576 --> 00:17:39,599
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how you fix the butt crack problem.

317
00:17:39,879 --> 00:17:44,504
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like there's no bits to show and no coloration in certain places.

318
00:17:44,985 --> 00:17:49,631
[SPEAKER_10]: And someone has made, by the way, I found that ages ago, but I didn't know that it actually was based off of real texture.

319
00:17:50,271 --> 00:17:52,171
[SPEAKER_10]: and you can unlock the texture and it's like, okay, whatever.

320
00:17:52,191 --> 00:17:52,912
[SPEAKER_03]: And who'd have thunk it?

321
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:54,872
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the person that draws the vaginas for you.

322
00:17:54,892 --> 00:17:56,532
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's not the same person.

323
00:17:57,433 --> 00:17:58,593
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not the same person.

324
00:17:59,793 --> 00:18:05,914
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's actually, did you know that there are two different fabric textures for the underwear?

325
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:07,835
[SPEAKER_10]: There's shiny and matte.

326
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:11,536
[SPEAKER_04]: I just learned something that I never thought I'd ever know in my life.

327
00:18:11,796 --> 00:18:14,936
[SPEAKER_10]: But I've had my shepherd running around in an all black uniform.

328
00:18:15,356 --> 00:18:18,497
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's actually black and a lighter black for the camo.

329
00:18:19,484 --> 00:18:35,019
[SPEAKER_04]: I have seen some hilarious gifs on Tumblr of I guess there's a way to hack it so that you can play male Shepard in his underwear through the whole game and there's some hilarious gifs of male Shepard jumping out of a starship and he's in his underwear.

330
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,240
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks really funny.

331
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:46,169
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you can actually, in the Coalesce Dye and Eye, because basically all you do, you can add lines to have it pull different textures for different outfits.

332
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:50,353
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can actually wear armor in casual look and wear casual clothes into armor.

333
00:18:50,653 --> 00:18:54,917
[SPEAKER_10]: There's also a way to use Ashley's clothes, but I went and looked through the actual meshes.

334
00:18:55,878 --> 00:19:10,963
[SPEAKER_10]: The reason why there's a big problem with people using Ashley's face is first of all it's fully colored so if you have it over a colored face already it's going to show up orange and part of her chest is rendered so you'd actually get Shepard with a hole in her chest if you try to use Ashley's clothes with no boobs pretty much.

335
00:19:11,423 --> 00:19:12,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh boy, alright.

336
00:19:12,504 --> 00:19:14,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, this is what I spent all week doing.

337
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,029
[SPEAKER_04]: You're gonna need your own podcast about Mass Effect at some point.

338
00:19:17,129 --> 00:19:17,509
[SPEAKER_10]: Just wait.

339
00:19:17,749 --> 00:19:18,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on.

340
00:19:19,011 --> 00:19:19,731
[SPEAKER_10]: But I did play another game.

341
00:19:19,911 --> 00:19:20,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, what else?

342
00:19:20,712 --> 00:19:26,238
[SPEAKER_10]: Dragon Age Origins, and I made a Dalish, which I sometimes want to call a Danish.

343
00:19:26,698 --> 00:19:31,503
[SPEAKER_10]: She's a redhead, kind of cool, and I don't know that I like the game so much yet, but I'm gonna give it a try.

344
00:19:31,863 --> 00:19:37,993
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it might be one of those games that, you know, I didn't really love it the first time I played it, but I went back later and I liked it a little more.

345
00:19:38,193 --> 00:19:40,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's just kind of, sometimes games don't really hit you the first time.

346
00:19:41,217 --> 00:19:42,880
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just really not a big fan of the combat in it.

347
00:19:43,381 --> 00:19:46,425
[SPEAKER_10]: But I might go back and see about getting Dragon Age 2.

348
00:19:48,445 --> 00:20:15,781
[SPEAKER_10]: which I started playing on Xbox 360 and got pretty far in until that stupid battle where Fenris is like I'm gonna be emo and kill you now see that's really weird because most of the fandom really doesn't like Dragon Age 2 but it plays like Mass Effect I mean really I like the way it plays that's why I could get into Mass Effect so easily because it handled the same way well you know there's a third one coming out maybe it'll be somewhere in the middle and I played very solitaire

349
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:16,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Game Sucks

350
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:40,131
[SPEAKER_12]: I just learned something there you go the more you know

351
00:20:56,177 --> 00:21:00,780
[SPEAKER_12]: I find something new in every single replay.

352
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,001
[SPEAKER_12]: There's always one more secret door I haven't gone through.

353
00:21:03,121 --> 00:21:04,842
[SPEAKER_12]: There's one more connection to Half-Life.

354
00:21:06,143 --> 00:21:11,687
[SPEAKER_12]: The way they paint their characters, everything's pretty three-dimensional, so I appreciate it on a couple different levels.

355
00:21:11,707 --> 00:21:13,268
[SPEAKER_12]: You should talk to Alan about Half-Life at some point.

356
00:21:13,288 --> 00:21:14,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you a big Half-Life fan as well?

357
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:15,869
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

358
00:21:41,122 --> 00:21:42,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Modern Warfare 3 Modern Warfare 3

359
00:21:57,692 --> 00:22:12,820
[SPEAKER_03]: and also some other stuff because the website I had set up had went down because the free URL forwarding company, co.cc, went under and all the like 5 million domains that they had are poof, gone.

360
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,941
[SPEAKER_03]: So I actually got a legit domain now.

361
00:22:15,021 --> 00:22:21,004
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's now at vog-minecraft.com and there's not really anything there other than the map right now.

362
00:22:21,204 --> 00:22:23,325
[SPEAKER_03]: But eventually there'll be something there.

363
00:22:23,965 --> 00:22:27,127
[SPEAKER_03]: So I put that in our chat room, vog-minecraft.com

364
00:22:27,683 --> 00:22:30,684
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's also a Twitter account to go along with that.

365
00:22:31,485 --> 00:22:33,705
[SPEAKER_03]: VOG Minecraft at Twitter.

366
00:22:33,866 --> 00:22:34,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at you.

367
00:22:35,366 --> 00:22:38,367
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

368
00:22:38,387 --> 00:22:44,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been kind of busy with stuff this week and then hopefully I'll get working on the website soon.

369
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:50,032
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know what I want to do with it but I've got it for a while so we'll play around with that.

370
00:22:50,472 --> 00:22:51,533
[SPEAKER_03]: What else did I do this week?

371
00:22:52,473 --> 00:22:53,493
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I played anything else.

372
00:22:53,753 --> 00:22:54,314
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that was it.

373
00:22:54,394 --> 00:22:55,034
[SPEAKER_03]: That was all I played.

374
00:22:56,899 --> 00:23:03,783
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually had a lot of time to play some games thanks to the holiday break and I didn't have too much going on outside of Thanksgiving Day itself.

375
00:23:05,204 --> 00:23:09,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously I've been able to spend more time with the Wii U because on the last show it was launch day.

376
00:23:10,267 --> 00:23:12,028
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd only really spent like an hour with it.

377
00:23:12,108 --> 00:23:19,433
[SPEAKER_04]: So now I've been able to spend some quality time with the Wii U and I've played three different games on the Wii U and two of them are the ones that everybody's been playing.

378
00:23:19,453 --> 00:23:21,014
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll talk first about Nintendo Land.

379
00:23:21,814 --> 00:23:49,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo Land is a collection of minigames basically I think it's framed a lot better than Wii Sports was I think Monita though as a character will get a little bit irritating to some people but she serves her purpose especially for trying to get those that are not as familiar with how to play a video game acquainted with the games there are some pretty neat games in there I think I like the minigames in it more than I like Wii Sports because let's be real at the end of the day

380
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,841
[SPEAKER_04]: WeTennis was about flailing.

381
00:23:51,961 --> 00:23:53,282
[SPEAKER_04]: There wasn't a lot of skill to it.

382
00:23:53,542 --> 00:23:54,783
[SPEAKER_04]: There wasn't a lot that went into it.

383
00:23:54,863 --> 00:23:57,864
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like imagination with the help of this controller.

384
00:23:58,304 --> 00:24:00,586
[SPEAKER_04]: WeBowling was slightly a little better.

385
00:24:00,646 --> 00:24:05,188
[SPEAKER_04]: You felt like you were a little more in control of your actions, but it was kind of eh at the end of the day as well.

386
00:24:05,228 --> 00:24:09,610
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Wii Sports, when all is said and done, I know not everybody's going to agree with this comment.

387
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:12,692
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand why it ends up on the top 100 gaming list and all that.

388
00:24:12,732 --> 00:24:14,133
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a very influential game.

389
00:24:14,473 --> 00:24:16,334
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think Wii Sports is actually a really good game.

390
00:24:17,054 --> 00:24:19,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Nintendo Land because as a gamer, I feel like there's more game in it.

391
00:24:32,496 --> 00:24:34,537
[SPEAKER_04]: There's more to actually achieve.

392
00:24:35,898 --> 00:24:38,019
[SPEAKER_04]: The Metroid Blast was fun.

393
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:43,542
[SPEAKER_04]: The F-Zero race, it's certainly not F-Zero, but it's simple enough.

394
00:24:43,702 --> 00:24:47,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of like Atari 2600 basic, but all of these modern graphics.

395
00:24:47,284 --> 00:24:48,125
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun.

396
00:24:49,425 --> 00:24:58,230
[SPEAKER_04]: The Donkey Kong course is surprisingly like... It's like one of those Mega Man hard games, and all it is is tilting.

397
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:00,291
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's surprisingly quite a bit of fun.

398
00:25:00,972 --> 00:25:01,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

399
00:25:02,092 --> 00:25:20,929
[SPEAKER_04]: and you know some of the some of the different minigames especially in a party environment the party games the Mario Chase, Animal Crossing, Luigi's Mansion all hilarious we played those on Thanksgiving Day and they were all just a ton of fun especially I think Mario Chase was my personal favorite out of the bunch though Luigi's Mansion is really good as well and Animal Crossing is its own thing

400
00:25:21,529 --> 00:25:28,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but I mean, at its core, those three games are all kind of chase games.

401
00:25:28,331 --> 00:25:31,012
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just like a different twist on the chase element.

402
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:37,493
[SPEAKER_04]: Like in Luigi's Mansion, you're hidden and you're trying to grab the others before they grab you.

403
00:25:37,914 --> 00:25:40,094
[SPEAKER_04]: In Mario Chase, they're just trying to grab you.

404
00:25:40,534 --> 00:25:44,455
[SPEAKER_04]: In Animal Crossing, you control two people and there's the whole eating the pellets.

405
00:25:44,495 --> 00:25:46,736
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess it's a little more, uh, different.

406
00:25:47,696 --> 00:25:52,520
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw brings up in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com What about that Pachinko in Nintendo Land?

407
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,321
[SPEAKER_04]: The Pachinko game.

408
00:25:53,401 --> 00:25:55,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I call it Plinko, but yeah, it's pretty much the same thing.

409
00:25:56,163 --> 00:25:57,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, they're pretty much the same thing.

410
00:25:57,824 --> 00:25:58,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Paplinko?

411
00:25:58,945 --> 00:25:59,465
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Plinko.

412
00:25:59,866 --> 00:26:01,026
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, but I was saying Paplinko.

413
00:26:01,447 --> 00:26:01,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Paplinko?

414
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:03,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead of Pachinko, Paplinko.

415
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:03,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Paplinko?

416
00:26:03,969 --> 00:26:04,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, okay, that works.

417
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:09,453
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a Paplinko game you play to get the unlocks, but eh, I could give or take it.

418
00:26:09,493 --> 00:26:10,794
[SPEAKER_04]: The unlock is a little bit silly.

419
00:26:11,474 --> 00:26:11,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

420
00:26:12,575 --> 00:26:15,536
[SPEAKER_04]: But as a pack-in game overall, it's fine.

421
00:26:16,196 --> 00:26:21,838
[SPEAKER_04]: I would see myself revisiting this game far more than I would revisit Wii Sports.

422
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario U, Super Mario Wii U, is great.

423
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,561
[SPEAKER_04]: It's HD Mario.

424
00:26:29,041 --> 00:26:30,041
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what you'd expect.

425
00:26:30,361 --> 00:26:39,565
[SPEAKER_04]: What I love about it is that it's not just a game with the depth of Super Mario World, but it has all these little extra modes as well to kind of enhance it, like the...

426
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:42,026
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

427
00:26:58,897 --> 00:27:03,120
[SPEAKER_04]: The difficulty level of the game ramps up surprisingly quick, and there's some really hard stuff.

428
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,361
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to use an FAQ to get past one of the levels.

429
00:27:05,701 --> 00:27:07,683
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't find the stinking door out of the ghost house.

430
00:27:08,003 --> 00:27:11,005
[SPEAKER_04]: And then come to find out, there's like a second one I probably would have never have found.

431
00:27:11,405 --> 00:27:22,432
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm liking Mario Wii U as a really solid Mario game, even more than I think the one that was previously out on Wii, Wii Regular.

432
00:27:22,712 --> 00:27:25,634
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if that's just because the huge step up in the graphics or what.

433
00:27:26,354 --> 00:27:27,194
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

434
00:27:46,602 --> 00:27:49,244
[SPEAKER_04]: All the screen does is mirror what's on your TV.

435
00:27:50,064 --> 00:27:55,868
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to do the whole, I play something on my Wii U while you watch something on TV, that's great.

436
00:27:56,328 --> 00:27:59,650
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have control of your TV, it doesn't really add a lot to the experience.

437
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:04,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Luckily, it's a gorgeous game to look at, even with all the little touches in the background.

438
00:28:04,233 --> 00:28:06,595
[SPEAKER_04]: They have little dancing Miis that show up in the background and stuff.

439
00:28:06,615 --> 00:28:08,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Just all these little touches that are really cool.

440
00:28:08,796 --> 00:28:12,601
[SPEAKER_04]: and the sound thing that I really hyped up last week is great.

441
00:28:14,022 --> 00:28:19,108
[SPEAKER_04]: The surround sound it kind of creates between the pad and the regular stereo is pretty cool.

442
00:28:19,729 --> 00:28:26,076
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, Mario's solid and I'm sure most people that will get a Wii U will pick this game up and it makes sense.

443
00:28:26,317 --> 00:28:26,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

444
00:28:27,678 --> 00:28:51,541
[SPEAKER_04]: um one other game I've been playing on the Wii U that was one of the launch titles uh Sonic Racing no Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed which is a game that's actually on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 as well it's just you know they also have the Wii U version this is the game we've been talking about on the show we kind of been joking about it and having fun with it because it has Danica Patrick very randomly as a character and it's amazing eyeliner

445
00:28:52,141 --> 00:29:03,684
[SPEAKER_04]: and Wreck-It Ralph and all these other Sega characters like Metal Sonic, Beat, one of the taxi cab drivers from Crazy Taxi, supposedly Alex Kidd gets unlocked at some point.

446
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:09,826
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really surprised at how much I'm enjoying this game.

447
00:29:10,886 --> 00:29:37,390
[SPEAKER_04]: and I took a look at some of the reviews online and some of the talk in Miiverse and so forth and a lot of people razzing it for being buggy and I will admit there's been some odd collision detection things but nothing that detracted from the experience so much I was like hating the game in fact I found myself most of the time actually really impressed with some of the level design the stages are all huge stages and they will seamlessly go from

448
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:44,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Go-karting to flying a plane and Danica Patrick's car turns into like an afterburner jet, which is kind of funny.

449
00:29:44,653 --> 00:29:45,853
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the water.

450
00:29:45,893 --> 00:29:48,895
[SPEAKER_04]: And it kind of just seamlessly transitions between all these different phases.

451
00:29:49,475 --> 00:29:50,575
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was liking it.

452
00:29:51,476 --> 00:29:56,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I was showing you girls before the show tonight, I showed you the Skies of Arcadia level.

453
00:29:56,498 --> 00:30:03,921
[SPEAKER_04]: And you saw how you'll do the first lap and then in the second lap, the pirate ships start attacking the town and are blowing up the road and all this stuff.

454
00:30:03,941 --> 00:30:04,921
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot going on.

455
00:30:04,941 --> 00:30:04,961
[SPEAKER_04]: I

456
00:30:07,282 --> 00:30:24,091
[SPEAKER_04]: I was really into it I gotta admit I'm kind of liking this game I think a little more than the online impressions I mean it's it's got not just a regular mode but all these like special little games in it like boost mode and kill the other people first and there's a battle mode you can play it online on the Wii U

457
00:30:25,171 --> 00:30:30,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently the advantage that the Wii U has over the other versions is that the Wii U is up to five players thanks to the second screen.

458
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:36,261
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just a copy of the first screen in single player mode unless you want it to be.

459
00:30:36,602 --> 00:30:39,104
[SPEAKER_04]: If you swipe the screen, you get a copy of the TV.

460
00:30:39,464 --> 00:30:41,726
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you don't, you get a rear view mirror and a map.

461
00:30:42,147 --> 00:30:44,529
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, kind of what you'd expect in your racing game on the second screen.

462
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:48,012
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I was really surprised.

463
00:30:48,252 --> 00:30:49,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I was kind of like playing it going...

464
00:30:50,174 --> 00:31:00,048
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Sega did help with that F-Zero game that was on the GameCube and I gotta say, this feels like kind of the closest thing I'm gonna get to an F-Zero game for a little while.

465
00:31:00,669 --> 00:31:03,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless maybe they're gonna work on it, which I really hope they do.

466
00:31:03,513 --> 00:31:03,973
[SPEAKER_11]: Sugar Rush.

467
00:31:04,033 --> 00:31:05,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Or yeah, or just flat out do a Sugar Rush game.

468
00:31:05,956 --> 00:31:06,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Sugar Rush!

469
00:31:07,805 --> 00:31:16,574
[SPEAKER_04]: It's weird because the Wreck-It Ralph thing, like, I don't... I mean, it's cool that Wreck-It Ralph and Danica Patrick are in there, I guess, but there's not really a lot else.

470
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:20,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you don't have the sugar rest stage, or at least I haven't got it yet, or any of that.

471
00:31:20,739 --> 00:31:22,480
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's interesting.

472
00:31:23,361 --> 00:31:33,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to some of the comments from our chatters at live.vognetwork.com, Tigerclaw says, the new Sonic racing game is a lot of fun, but boy, it gets pretty hard when doing the medium difficulty on many of the races in difficulty.

473
00:31:33,644 --> 00:31:35,864
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't get past the drift challenges on medium.

474
00:31:36,245 --> 00:31:41,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can do some of it on medium, but like the boost challenge, I couldn't even do that on...

475
00:31:41,946 --> 00:31:56,869
[SPEAKER_04]: regular and here's a little tip for anybody struggling with the game if you flop on a stage four times it'll let you just skip it on the map so you know but you'll still need stars you'll have to compensate the stars from somewhere else in order to be able to get the unlock so I don't know

476
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:01,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Tiger Claw suggests that maybe some of the Wreck-It-Ralph stuff will be DLC.

477
00:32:01,591 --> 00:32:03,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know how the Wii U is going to handle that.

478
00:32:04,052 --> 00:32:09,313
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will say that part of it kind of concerns me that the Wii U doesn't seem to have a DLC system in place.

479
00:32:09,814 --> 00:32:17,216
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the reason I haven't picked up Mass Effect 3 is I hear that none of the multiplayer enhancements they've done since launch are available.

480
00:32:17,616 --> 00:32:19,336
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, well, then what's the frigging point?

481
00:32:19,696 --> 00:32:25,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Like part of the reason the Mass Effect 3 multiplayer is so amazing is because of all the constant DLC they've been putting out.

482
00:32:26,158 --> 00:32:30,100
[SPEAKER_04]: and I understand that some of the single player DLC is included but they're not going to get Omega.

483
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:30,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

484
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Nintendo can't do DLC yet.

485
00:32:33,502 --> 00:32:36,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if they can, they're not doing it a lot or something.

486
00:32:36,723 --> 00:32:37,063
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

487
00:32:37,103 --> 00:32:37,964
[SPEAKER_04]: So that part of it...

488
00:32:39,048 --> 00:33:05,689
[SPEAKER_04]: with all the positive I'm saying about the Wii U and overall I am satisfied with my purchase I would be in love with my purchase if some of these other things were corrected but I don't know Nintendo has over the past week been building a lot into the system we got over the past week we got the Netflix the Amazon the YouTube the Hulu and all that showed up like you know just day after day after day and I gotta say the YouTube app in particular

489
00:33:06,329 --> 00:33:10,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Very different look from the other, the PS3 and the Xbox Ones.

490
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:10,710
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not bad.

491
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby said he didn't care for it, right?

492
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:12,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

493
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:13,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby said he didn't care for it, right?

494
00:33:14,231 --> 00:33:22,652
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember what he said about YouTube, but the look of it is weird because it doesn't really have any Nintendo branding and it doesn't really have Microsoft.

495
00:33:23,212 --> 00:33:27,553
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of different and it works pretty well, especially if you're logged in.

496
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:34,935
[SPEAKER_04]: I enjoyed it more than the Xbox version of it, even though it functions similarly to

497
00:33:35,575 --> 00:33:37,197
[SPEAKER_04]: But it still felt easier to use.

498
00:33:37,257 --> 00:33:38,898
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe part of that is having the touchpad.

499
00:33:38,938 --> 00:33:39,339
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

500
00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:40,280
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.

501
00:33:41,414 --> 00:33:42,514
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

502
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:45,476
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw on chat says, Nintendo is just taking baby steps.

503
00:33:45,516 --> 00:33:47,676
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a whole new thing for them, the online community.

504
00:33:48,136 --> 00:33:51,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yes, but at some point you have to stop letting that be an excuse.

505
00:33:52,298 --> 00:33:58,360
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think a lot of us have said, oh, Nintendo, you're just new to the party and so we forgive you.

506
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,561
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of like, okay, that's true, but it's not an excuse.

507
00:34:02,162 --> 00:34:05,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, playing catch-up, you know, you've had a lot of time to play catch-up.

508
00:34:06,403 --> 00:34:09,624
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you should have thought about some of this during the Wii being out there.

509
00:34:10,165 --> 00:34:10,445
[SPEAKER_04]: But,

510
00:34:11,445 --> 00:34:17,087
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some parts about the Wii U like Miiverse is surprisingly interesting.

511
00:34:17,347 --> 00:34:20,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's actually something I keep going back to and looking at.

512
00:34:20,788 --> 00:34:24,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I like looking at the activity feed of my friends and what they've been posting in the games.

513
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:29,892
[SPEAKER_04]: The first party games really urge you to make public posts in Miiverse to interact with.

514
00:34:30,472 --> 00:34:32,953
[SPEAKER_04]: And I find like I want to see what my friends are posting.

515
00:34:33,293 --> 00:34:35,714
[SPEAKER_04]: And the artwork people are doing is amazing.

516
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:49,599
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if you guys know this, but in the Wii U, when you turn it on, if you have your Wii U always connected to the internet, it downloads artwork from around the community, like things that have been popular or voted.

517
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:55,821
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you turn on your Wii, you'll see a helping of random games, and then you'll see some of the popular comments.

518
00:34:55,921 --> 00:35:00,022
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're all these artwork that is really well done and funny.

519
00:35:00,543 --> 00:35:00,883
[SPEAKER_04]: And so...

520
00:35:02,003 --> 00:35:29,501
[SPEAKER_04]: I find it really neat and I don't know if this is what Nintendo intended but you gotta hand it to them this is something Microsoft and Sony aren't doing with their online so let's give Nintendo some credit here the first thing you get when you turn on your system is community you don't even get that with Xbox and Sony that's surprising so if there's one thing Nintendo is doing right when it comes to online community is the first thing you see

521
00:35:31,744 --> 00:35:32,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

522
00:35:33,727 --> 00:35:33,988
[SPEAKER_10]: Agreed.

523
00:35:34,569 --> 00:35:38,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Now obviously they have some slow steps in other places, but that's one step in the right direction.

524
00:35:41,715 --> 00:36:08,708
[SPEAKER_04]: going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com Ragenator in chat says interesting or just a novelty that you'll forget about in a month or two that's a very good question Ragenator and I think a lot of that depends on how well will the games in the future support it and what else will come what download content is going to come out what's going to keep the people talking what's going to keep the people providing those funny pictures and so forth and will they allow you to add cat pics later on

525
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:13,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, apparently, like, people have been doing really random stuff.

526
00:36:13,241 --> 00:36:15,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I was reading something on my Facebook.

527
00:36:15,522 --> 00:36:22,084
[SPEAKER_04]: The Destructoid community took over one of the... I think it was the Rabbids game community with pictures of Willem Dafoe.

528
00:36:22,505 --> 00:36:30,287
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what the joke is there, but, like, they were drawing Willem Dafoe and writing... I mean, I don't... Sorry, I don't... I don't have time to read every single website on the internet.

529
00:36:30,587 --> 00:36:33,288
[SPEAKER_04]: But, like, I thought it was funny that they're kind of, like, trying to do that.

530
00:36:33,388 --> 00:36:35,229
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, so...

531
00:36:35,709 --> 00:36:37,970
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, people come up with their own ways to entertain themselves.

532
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:43,152
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's turning into GameFAQs, basically, where they'll take over a message board.

533
00:36:44,293 --> 00:36:46,974
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how well they've succeeded, but yes, possibly.

534
00:36:47,634 --> 00:36:48,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Fantastic.

535
00:36:49,275 --> 00:36:51,496
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what Nintendo needs is more GameFAQs.

536
00:36:52,957 --> 00:36:55,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby in our chatroom wants to clarify some stuff.

537
00:36:55,459 --> 00:36:59,243
[SPEAKER_04]: BlackWolf says, Okay, A, Nintendo has a DLC system in place.

538
00:36:59,623 --> 00:37:00,664
[SPEAKER_04]: New Super Mario Bros.

539
00:37:00,824 --> 00:37:02,546
[SPEAKER_04]: U will have DLC, for instance.

540
00:37:03,066 --> 00:37:05,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that may be true, but where is it?

541
00:37:05,748 --> 00:37:06,769
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not here at launch.

542
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,271
[SPEAKER_04]: That leads me to think...

543
00:37:08,971 --> 00:37:09,993
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still being built.

544
00:37:10,133 --> 00:37:12,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember my Winchester House comparison from last week?

545
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:14,138
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's what's happening.

546
00:37:14,459 --> 00:37:18,625
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have any proof, but at the same time, where is the DLC?

547
00:37:18,645 --> 00:37:19,706
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gonna be there at launch.

548
00:37:20,147 --> 00:37:21,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, they've got six more years.

549
00:37:22,546 --> 00:37:24,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let's see.

550
00:37:24,447 --> 00:37:28,988
[SPEAKER_04]: And Blackwolf said, B, I think YouTube videos look better in the internet browser than in the app.

551
00:37:29,909 --> 00:37:34,370
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can watch videos on the gamepad from the browser not available in the app.

552
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:37,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Blackwolf also clarifying, I guess he reads more Destructoid than I do.

553
00:37:38,112 --> 00:37:46,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Blackwolf says, the initial joke was Jim Sterling said, I am remaking the community to be about Willem Dafoe because that's a better use of this community than the game.

554
00:37:46,655 --> 00:37:47,235
Okay.

555
00:37:47,915 --> 00:37:49,576
[SPEAKER_04]: The post got moderated away.

556
00:37:50,177 --> 00:37:53,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you not see how many people were pissed off at Day 1 DLC?

557
00:37:53,699 --> 00:37:57,001
[SPEAKER_04]: How pissed would you be if there was Day 1 DLC for New Super Mario Bros.

558
00:37:57,161 --> 00:37:57,261
[SPEAKER_04]: U?

559
00:37:58,321 --> 00:38:05,225
[SPEAKER_04]: But Bobby, I am pissed off that there isn't Day 1 DLC for the other games to play catch-up, especially when that DLC is free.

560
00:38:05,686 --> 00:38:13,310
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the case of Mass Effect 3, yes, I do feel like 100% of the game isn't there, especially when you're trying to be competitive with these other consoles.

561
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:38,756
[SPEAKER_04]: I get that some of the single player DLC but when you're kind of trying to play catch up you know I think that part is missing I get what you're saying about the whole you don't want day one DLC for new Super Mario Brothers Wii U I get that but that's also first party versus third party and you know maybe Nintendo hasn't built it because they don't need it for themselves yet so screw everybody else I don't know anyway

562
00:38:40,219 --> 00:38:45,102
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I've talked enough about the Wii U. Sorry, guys, but it's with the hot thing that's going on in gaming right now.

563
00:38:45,322 --> 00:38:47,944
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing I want to talk about in my gaming week, just real quick, I'll throw this out there.

564
00:38:48,624 --> 00:38:51,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Despite the fact that I have a shiny new console, it doesn't mean I'm not going to play other stuff.

565
00:38:52,306 --> 00:39:01,652
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been participating in the Mass Effect 3 weekend challenge like a good player, and I played an epic nine-hour match of Civilization V, start to finish.

566
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:04,233
[SPEAKER_04]: and I know some people are going only nine hours.

567
00:39:04,593 --> 00:39:11,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we did kind of an easier skill level and we agreed the three of us that were playing would not military strike each other but it was a lot of fun.

568
00:39:11,654 --> 00:39:26,078
[SPEAKER_04]: It was my first Gods and Kings game start to finish so I was, you know, thankful I played it and I am still enjoying Civ V and it's on sale right now on Steam and I would support a purchase of that if you wanted to do that.

569
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:27,298
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

570
00:39:27,978 --> 00:39:28,258
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

571
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:31,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, that is all I want to say about my gaming week.

572
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Housekeeping tonight.

573
00:39:34,381 --> 00:39:42,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, we always like to plug our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, and our Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, and our Google+, search for Orange Lounge Radio.

574
00:39:43,305 --> 00:39:46,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, this one's for the live listeners more so than the podcast listeners.

575
00:39:47,147 --> 00:39:50,909
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping so far tonight, live listeners, we haven't had any dropouts on the feed.

576
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:56,632
[SPEAKER_04]: I know the fact that the stream has been dropping out lately has been very frustrating, but

577
00:39:57,592 --> 00:40:03,373
[SPEAKER_04]: and so we didn't really know if it was us or if it was the host but there's a good chance that it's us here in studio.

578
00:40:03,953 --> 00:40:09,694
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we did on Friday, Alan and I went out and we got a new router for the studio here.

579
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:17,515
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have like a brand new, it's not like top of the line because I'm sorry, I didn't have 200 bucks to drop on a router but we did get one of those like, what is it, 600?

580
00:40:17,996 --> 00:40:18,976
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like 300 plus 300.

581
00:40:19,916 --> 00:40:21,976
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a huge step up from what we had.

582
00:40:22,236 --> 00:40:26,437
[SPEAKER_04]: Our last router couldn't even do wireless N so we did upgrade that

583
00:40:26,997 --> 00:40:32,180
[SPEAKER_04]: We had this whole thing going on where you actually had two networks in the house and one was daisy-chained to the other.

584
00:40:32,641 --> 00:40:35,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's parent router and bridge.

585
00:40:36,463 --> 00:40:40,866
[SPEAKER_04]: I wrote a post in the VOG Network forums in more detail if you want to see all the parts there.

586
00:40:41,286 --> 00:40:41,907
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think...

587
00:40:42,387 --> 00:41:10,970
[SPEAKER_04]: so far the stream hasn't dropped and the evil protagonist in our chat says sounds great tonight so maybe it was us I didn't want to let that go forever without trying to fix it so fingers crossed now that I've talked about it it's going to drop in the next two minutes just watch but hey that's better than 20 times during the show like last week which was very very frustrating so thank you to our loyal live listeners who have stuck it out throughout all those drops we're trying to make the situation better for you guys I hope it works tonight

588
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:11,950
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

589
00:41:13,811 --> 00:41:17,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Ragenator brings up, you know, by bringing up the stream dropping, you just jinxed yourself.

590
00:41:17,613 --> 00:41:18,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hey, you know what?

591
00:41:18,413 --> 00:41:21,355
[SPEAKER_04]: We got through 48 minutes without one, which beats last week.

592
00:41:21,455 --> 00:41:24,757
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's just hope.

593
00:41:25,877 --> 00:41:26,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Also...

594
00:41:27,558 --> 00:41:32,381
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a slow news week tonight, you guys, with the holiday going on and everything here in the States.

595
00:41:32,801 --> 00:41:37,304
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will tease the coming up in Part B tonight, Match Game.

596
00:41:37,364 --> 00:41:40,686
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't done Match Game in at least a year, so we're going to do Match Game tonight.

597
00:41:40,766 --> 00:41:44,208
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will have contestants, one via Skype, one via the chat.

598
00:41:44,248 --> 00:41:50,252
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to be potentially our Skype player, make sure you have Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, added on Skype.

599
00:41:50,532 --> 00:41:51,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, we're not doing that now.

600
00:41:51,773 --> 00:41:54,715
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get into it in Part B. I'll let you know when to call.

601
00:41:55,683 --> 00:41:57,604
[SPEAKER_04]: All the symphony of the night you can stand.

602
00:42:25,256 --> 00:42:29,298
[SPEAKER_03]: True, or, you know, if this is going to be like... So much Yaris.

603
00:42:29,698 --> 00:42:31,079
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's going to be... I'm interested in this.

604
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:38,902
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's going to be like a digital, like a digital Xbox where it's not going to have a disk drive or something like that, it's going to be built into a TV, like as an app.

605
00:42:39,803 --> 00:42:42,584
[SPEAKER_03]: I could see it maybe like, you know, with the games on demand stuff.

606
00:42:42,604 --> 00:42:45,005
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just about to say, couldn't they do games on demand still though?

607
00:42:45,325 --> 00:42:45,966
[SPEAKER_03]: That's possible.

608
00:42:46,226 --> 00:42:49,927
[SPEAKER_04]: All it needs is a USB port and you can suddenly, oh, magical 64 gigs.

609
00:42:51,088 --> 00:42:52,609
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're saying, of course...

610
00:42:53,789 --> 00:42:57,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Anonymous sources are telling them that it's going to be dubbed Xbox TV.

611
00:42:57,671 --> 00:43:01,093
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to support casual games and run on Windows 8.

612
00:43:01,373 --> 00:43:06,355
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's just going to be running on the dashboard that's out there that kind of looks like Windows 8.

613
00:43:07,456 --> 00:43:12,999
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess some sort of chipset is going to allow for quick bootups and that kind of stuff.

614
00:43:13,639 --> 00:43:24,712
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're saying that it's also going to be able to kind of like, I don't know, maybe kind of incorporate surface stuff or smart glass or anything like that.

615
00:43:27,482 --> 00:43:32,746
[SPEAKER_03]: and I guess, you know, Microsoft made a statement regarding the set-up box plans.

616
00:43:32,766 --> 00:43:44,233
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying Xbox 360 has found new ways to extend the console lifecycle by introducing controller-free experiences with Kinect and reinventing the console with a new dashboard and new entertainment content partnerships.

617
00:43:44,253 --> 00:43:49,717
[SPEAKER_04]: The typical bullshit line they're going to give when the Christmas season is going on and they don't want people to neglect what's happening now.

618
00:43:49,777 --> 00:43:51,818
[SPEAKER_03]: We are always thinking about what is next for our platform.

619
00:43:51,858 --> 00:43:53,679
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, yeah, that's probably going to be true.

620
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:57,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, in other words, don't think about what's coming out next year.

621
00:43:57,882 --> 00:44:00,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about putting a Kinect under your Christmas tree this year.

622
00:44:00,644 --> 00:44:01,544
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly what it is.

623
00:44:01,645 --> 00:44:06,428
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't put a Kinect under your Christmas tree unless you're into dancing games because all the games that have come out have been kind of crap.

624
00:44:06,448 --> 00:44:07,448
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean.

625
00:44:07,768 --> 00:44:08,489
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying.

626
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:15,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I know this is going to sound stupid and I'm going to sound like an idiot, but hear me out here.

627
00:44:15,492 --> 00:44:19,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Could this be a very corporate challenge to the Ouya?

628
00:44:20,693 --> 00:44:30,156
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that comparison is really weird because I know the Ouya's whole thing is open source and all this, but do you think still maybe Microsoft took a look at that whole thing and said...

629
00:44:30,956 --> 00:44:35,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe people want a $99 thing they just took up to their TV and play games with.

630
00:44:35,822 --> 00:44:39,587
[SPEAKER_04]: And although we sure as hell aren't going to make it open source, maybe we'll make it look like a PC.

631
00:44:39,727 --> 00:44:42,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, is this maybe a response to the Ouya, if true?

632
00:44:43,658 --> 00:44:44,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not.

633
00:44:44,198 --> 00:44:48,341
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they feel any threat from the OUYA yet, because there's no real system there.

634
00:44:48,361 --> 00:44:50,722
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can't feel a threat about something that's not out yet.

635
00:44:51,643 --> 00:44:56,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a threat, but it's doing what Microsoft does, taking an idea and trying to make it better, for better or for worse.

636
00:44:57,006 --> 00:44:57,326
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.

637
00:44:57,346 --> 00:45:00,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, if anything, they would be kind of going with the whole...

638
00:45:01,548 --> 00:45:08,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we've seen some of these integrated, maybe even looking at Apple TV or something like that.

639
00:45:08,912 --> 00:45:13,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, they're just a step away from actually having a system that runs apps and stuff.

640
00:45:15,075 --> 00:45:16,776
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's really going to...

641
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Be anything.

642
00:45:19,081 --> 00:45:22,703
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because if you think about it, let's say this comes out a year from now.

643
00:45:22,923 --> 00:45:32,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would I want to buy a stripped down version of the Xbox 360 when the regular Xbox 360 is probably going to be under $100 or just about $100?

644
00:45:32,189 --> 00:45:38,953
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you think about it, yes, you may not be able to get the brand new system that's out right now, but those older systems, they're already at about $100 or just over $100.

645
00:45:39,013 --> 00:45:39,894
[SPEAKER_03]: So why would I want to...

646
00:45:42,435 --> 00:45:48,739
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, put out something that's gonna... Maybe if it's one of those funky partnerships where it's all built into the TV.

647
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:53,582
[SPEAKER_04]: But, see, that's... Why would you buy something like that that's built into the TV?

648
00:45:53,622 --> 00:45:56,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Because... Why do people buy TVs with built-in Blu-ray players?

649
00:45:56,444 --> 00:45:59,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do people buy TVs with built-in Roku and so forth?

650
00:45:59,385 --> 00:46:02,387
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like those LaserDisc players that had the Sega CD built in it.

651
00:46:02,547 --> 00:46:02,927
[SPEAKER_03]: It's dumb.

652
00:46:02,947 --> 00:46:06,289
[SPEAKER_03]: You should never buy a TV with something built into it.

653
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:07,970
[SPEAKER_04]: You know who buys that stuff?

654
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:08,491
[SPEAKER_04]: My parents.

655
00:46:08,931 --> 00:46:09,691
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

656
00:46:33,821 --> 00:46:51,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though the thing might be capable of doing all this other stuff you're talking about with the more geometry wars and so forth, maybe the push is to grandma who enjoys Farmville now maybe wants apples to apples on her TV or whatever else Microsoft might reveal in the next year game-wise.

657
00:46:51,326 --> 00:46:52,587
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to be honest, though.

658
00:46:52,667 --> 00:46:57,208
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're saying that that's the reason that people would buy these TVs, I don't think those type of people would buy...

659
00:46:57,888 --> 00:46:58,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

660
00:47:16,577 --> 00:47:24,265
[SPEAKER_04]: So, well, because it won't just be a gaming console, it'll play the casual games, but it's going to have all of Microsoft's other stuff too.

661
00:47:24,305 --> 00:47:31,872
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll have all those channels with the, you know, the built-in Hulu and the Netflix and all that same shit you see on every console.

662
00:47:31,892 --> 00:47:33,073
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't think that they're going to do that.

663
00:47:33,093 --> 00:47:36,136
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only reason I don't think they're going to do that is because other people have done it better already.

664
00:47:36,356 --> 00:47:38,939
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's no reason to... Why wouldn't they want a piece of it then?

665
00:47:39,179 --> 00:47:40,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Why wouldn't they want a piece of it?

666
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:41,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I don't think that they...

667
00:47:41,901 --> 00:47:45,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Has that worked out well for them in the whole mobile phone department?

668
00:47:45,504 --> 00:47:50,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Have they really taken a large chunk of the business from Android and iOS?

669
00:47:51,729 --> 00:47:51,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

670
00:47:52,189 --> 00:47:54,491
[SPEAKER_03]: When does that ever stop Microsoft from trying?

671
00:47:55,852 --> 00:47:56,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Well...

672
00:47:57,433 --> 00:48:03,116
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that they're definitely not trying as hard with Windows Phone 8 and stuff.

673
00:48:03,636 --> 00:48:08,539
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably selling alright, but I don't hear people going, Oh, I need a Windows Phone 8.

674
00:48:08,999 --> 00:48:15,703
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more like, I need an iPhone 5, or I need the next spiffy Android phone that's going to come out.

675
00:48:15,763 --> 00:48:23,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a possibility that they'll come out with something like this to try to get people in, but I don't know why you would do it.

676
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:33,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just say that there are people that will buy things that don't make sense.

677
00:48:34,022 --> 00:48:34,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

678
00:48:35,343 --> 00:48:37,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me move on with some more news.

679
00:48:37,743 --> 00:48:43,205
[SPEAKER_04]: This is about some things that have gone on in the Wii U front since the console launched.

680
00:48:44,705 --> 00:48:49,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Some folks talking about a Miiverse hack and that Miiverse was hacked and all this.

681
00:48:49,549 --> 00:48:51,111
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not really what happened.

682
00:48:51,691 --> 00:48:57,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody on NeoGAF said that they were screwing around with Miiverse and they were able to get into the debug and admin options of Miiverse.

683
00:49:00,739 --> 00:49:02,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like that wasn't really what it is.

684
00:49:03,242 --> 00:49:04,563
[SPEAKER_04]: At least that's what Nintendo's claiming.

685
00:49:04,923 --> 00:49:06,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo's saying it was a prototype.

686
00:49:07,705 --> 00:49:13,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo did send out a statement to GamesIndustry.biz saying that what the user found was a mock-up menu.

687
00:49:13,751 --> 00:49:14,832
[SPEAKER_04]: It's no longer there.

688
00:49:15,572 --> 00:49:16,433
[SPEAKER_04]: It's inaccessible.

689
00:49:17,033 --> 00:49:26,462
[SPEAKER_04]: And that could be believable enough, especially if Miu, at its core, is basically running off a web protocol, which is certainly possible.

690
00:49:27,142 --> 00:49:28,344
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's absolutely possible.

691
00:49:28,384 --> 00:49:32,211
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole damn thing is running off a web-type-based protocol and we just kind of don't see it.

692
00:49:32,732 --> 00:49:33,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

693
00:49:34,334 --> 00:49:35,236
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably very easy.

694
00:49:35,617 --> 00:49:36,157
[SPEAKER_04]: So whatever.

695
00:49:36,218 --> 00:49:38,782
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm spouting like I know what I'm talking about.

696
00:49:42,515 --> 00:49:48,159
[SPEAKER_04]: It probably wasn't hard to find something like this in there, and I don't think it's very serious, especially if it was a mock-up.

697
00:49:48,219 --> 00:49:52,782
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, even just kind of looking at all the information on the screen, I don't think it's a big deal.

698
00:49:54,343 --> 00:50:02,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, if you want to know the full statement, quote, It has come to our attention that some of the people were able to access a mock-up menu on Miiverse following the launch of Wii U in the U.S.

699
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:06,793
[SPEAKER_04]: Please know that this is only a mock-up menu and has now been removed and is not accessible.

700
00:50:07,033 --> 00:50:10,796
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember how we were talking about those doors that you open up and just, wham, you run into a wall?

701
00:50:11,137 --> 00:50:13,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's another one of those trap doors right there.

702
00:50:13,749 --> 00:50:15,195
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

703
00:50:15,777 --> 00:50:16,558
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone stumbled.

704
00:50:17,878 --> 00:50:21,921
[SPEAKER_04]: One other bit on the Wii U. You've got to give Nintendo credit for this.

705
00:50:22,601 --> 00:50:42,353
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a comment from Frozenbyte who made Trine 2, which is one of the download titles available on Wii U. You may not know this because it hasn't been talked about as much as the launch game, but there are five download-only games available on the Wii U. I'm not talking about the retail end, but I'm talking about $15 download games available on Wii U right now.

706
00:50:42,753 --> 00:50:44,174
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally have not tried any yet.

707
00:50:45,034 --> 00:50:45,875
[SPEAKER_04]: but they're available.

708
00:50:45,915 --> 00:50:47,375
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had friends Do they have demos?

709
00:50:48,636 --> 00:50:49,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Not now, no.

710
00:50:49,817 --> 00:50:54,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, Nintendo way to be in the forefront of digital content.

711
00:50:54,839 --> 00:50:55,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck.

712
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,901
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation 1 had demos.

713
00:50:58,161 --> 00:50:59,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, but the Wii has demos.

714
00:50:59,722 --> 00:51:02,963
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, I'm going to say, was it ready to go by November 18th?

715
00:51:03,243 --> 00:51:04,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Look for it in December and January.

716
00:51:04,704 --> 00:51:05,525
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way it's going to be.

717
00:51:06,926 --> 00:51:07,406
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll happen.

718
00:51:07,746 --> 00:51:09,248
[SPEAKER_04]: It just wasn't ready November 18th.

719
00:51:09,928 --> 00:51:12,210
[SPEAKER_04]: But, okay, so they may not have demos, whatever.

720
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:14,372
[SPEAKER_04]: But let me get to this, because I do think this is worth mentioning.

721
00:51:14,753 --> 00:51:18,716
[SPEAKER_04]: So Frozen Byte, they made Trine 2, which is probably one of the more visible titles that's there.

722
00:51:19,417 --> 00:51:31,909
[SPEAKER_04]: A quote from Mikael Haveri, who's the marketing manager, quote, "...we have the power to price our products as we please, with just some basic guidelines from the big guys."

723
00:51:32,389 --> 00:51:38,792
[SPEAKER_04]: The step to this is purely from Nintendo's side and they can clearly see that their previous installments have not been up to par.

724
00:51:39,392 --> 00:51:44,654
[SPEAKER_04]: We can set our own pricing and actually continuing on that by setting our own sales whenever we want.

725
00:51:45,114 --> 00:51:50,597
[SPEAKER_04]: It is very close to what Apple and Steam are doing at the moment and very indie friendly.

726
00:51:51,777 --> 00:51:52,638
[SPEAKER_04]: So in other words...

727
00:51:53,778 --> 00:52:01,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo's tried to fix some of this and make the DLC part of the download distribution component of the Wii U a little bit lucrative.

728
00:52:02,524 --> 00:52:03,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Free patches!

729
00:52:04,065 --> 00:52:05,946
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do patching all you want for free.

730
00:52:06,987 --> 00:52:15,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Considering we've heard the bitches from folks who make the Xbox Live Arcade games complain about the pricing of the patching over there, that suddenly makes this very lucrative.

731
00:52:15,713 --> 00:52:20,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Being able to put your own game on sale when you want and all that, that's going to make this a lot more attractive.

732
00:52:21,377 --> 00:52:22,918
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be interesting to see if

733
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:43,102
[SPEAKER_04]: you know if it actually leads to the games being made because that's what it's really about if that happens though if there'll be any response from Microsoft and Sony but you got to admit Nintendo's doing the right thing there yeah so very interesting it makes good sense

734
00:52:43,672 --> 00:52:50,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, they've told us there are no basic payments for each patch and we can update our game almost as much as we want.

735
00:52:50,715 --> 00:52:52,556
[SPEAKER_04]: For indie developers, this is huge.

736
00:52:52,576 --> 00:52:55,457
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if that might be a lure for Minecraft.

737
00:52:55,517 --> 00:52:55,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

738
00:52:57,218 --> 00:52:57,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

739
00:52:58,018 --> 00:53:00,379
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to just throw making up stuff out there.

740
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:05,962
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Map in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com wanted to bring this up about the demos.

741
00:53:06,462 --> 00:53:08,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Wii U has kiosk demos.

742
00:53:08,883 --> 00:53:10,124
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure it will happen soon.

743
00:53:11,784 --> 00:53:15,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason wants to point out, Loki, iOS doesn't have demos.

744
00:53:17,668 --> 00:53:18,568
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not true.

745
00:53:18,748 --> 00:53:19,569
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not true either.

746
00:53:19,749 --> 00:53:20,910
[SPEAKER_04]: It's up to the developer.

747
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:21,890
[SPEAKER_04]: There's light versions.

748
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:26,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's that whole light thing that they do, and now the whole in-app purchases.

749
00:53:26,253 --> 00:53:33,297
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't think about it because it's different than how Xbox and PlayStation does demos, but developers found a way to do it.

750
00:53:35,259 --> 00:53:38,162
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be interesting to see how that plays out on Wii U if it does.

751
00:53:38,863 --> 00:53:39,844
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, moving on with more news.

752
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:40,344
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

753
00:53:40,664 --> 00:53:41,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait.

754
00:53:41,065 --> 00:53:42,146
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to add one last thing.

755
00:53:42,186 --> 00:53:42,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, go ahead.

756
00:53:42,666 --> 00:53:44,929
[SPEAKER_03]: There is actually some Wii hacks that actually happen.

757
00:53:45,209 --> 00:53:45,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

758
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:51,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Legit stuff that... It's not necessarily the Wii U, but it's in the Wii...

759
00:53:53,257 --> 00:53:54,358
[SPEAKER_03]: I fucking hate how they have this.

760
00:53:55,199 --> 00:54:00,686
[SPEAKER_03]: The Wii Channel on the Wii U because that makes all the sense in the world.

761
00:54:01,567 --> 00:54:05,331
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say, I might be the only person who didn't transfer their Wii stuff over.

762
00:54:05,571 --> 00:54:08,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't see the benefit of doing that right now.

763
00:54:09,776 --> 00:54:11,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Can a chatter sway me that I'm wrong on that?

764
00:54:11,878 --> 00:54:13,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would I want to do that?

765
00:54:13,928 --> 00:54:14,689
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

766
00:54:15,189 --> 00:54:21,014
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a loader that was available for the Wii using Super Smash Bros.

767
00:54:21,074 --> 00:54:23,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Brawl called Stack Smash.

768
00:54:23,796 --> 00:54:28,000
[SPEAKER_03]: And what it basically does is it uses a modified brawl stage.

769
00:54:30,441 --> 00:54:56,856
[SPEAKER_03]: save file to run unsigned code and that exploit still works on the Wii U and so you can actually run Wii Homebrew through the Wii channel on the Wii U and they've even gotten there was a game that was played in one of the videos I saw here also they're saying that basically not everything works like you can't use the hacks you know to create like the Homebrew channel and stuff like that

770
00:54:57,416 --> 00:55:08,860
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're saying right now, nothing that requires HackMe uses, I guess, the current kernel exploits or uses AHB prods will work.

771
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:13,582
[SPEAKER_03]: It says that includes Devolution, USB Loader, CIOS installers, and WeLinux.

772
00:55:14,342 --> 00:55:18,707
[SPEAKER_03]: But it says Nintendo cannot patch StackSmash using their current architecture.

773
00:55:18,827 --> 00:55:25,255
[SPEAKER_03]: While it's technically possible, it would require a lot of work on their part, and it could result in Super Smash Bros.

774
00:55:25,335 --> 00:55:27,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Brawl being unstable for all users.

775
00:55:27,778 --> 00:55:33,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, it's most likely they knew that that would work before the guy posted the video.

776
00:55:33,584 --> 00:55:45,315
[SPEAKER_04]: so in other words hackers gonna hack they're looking frantically for a way in that device the clock is running how fast can they find the way into the Wii U and they already have found kind of a way in

777
00:55:45,683 --> 00:55:54,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they found a kind of way in and they've also, there was a video here that I guess they're dumping the console keys from the Wii mode stuff.

778
00:55:56,111 --> 00:55:59,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know what exactly they would use with that, but still interesting, I guess.

779
00:56:01,074 --> 00:56:08,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting to note, though, Nintendo is kind of doing something where, you know, well, I guess Microsoft kind of does this, too, whenever you connect to live games.

780
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,882
[SPEAKER_04]: is that it's going to automatically download firmware.

781
00:56:10,962 --> 00:56:13,364
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it'll download it overnight when it's not on and all that.

782
00:56:13,464 --> 00:56:16,586
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like more how PlayStation Plus kind of does it.

783
00:56:18,087 --> 00:56:24,112
[SPEAKER_04]: In theory, I mean, we haven't seen it happen firsthand yet because there's only been the one patch, which most people do when you first turn on the system.

784
00:56:24,352 --> 00:56:24,993
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

785
00:56:39,628 --> 00:56:42,231
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I really wish they had the ring light stuff on there.

786
00:56:42,331 --> 00:56:43,673
[SPEAKER_04]: There were the messages.

787
00:56:44,534 --> 00:56:48,218
[SPEAKER_04]: You have the blue, it's now the home button on the pad is a blue light.

788
00:56:48,518 --> 00:56:51,121
[SPEAKER_04]: And whenever friends sign on and off, that little light lights up.

789
00:56:51,221 --> 00:56:53,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's just not as sexy as it was on the Wii.

790
00:56:53,404 --> 00:56:57,048
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not, but I just want to point out it's sort of there.

791
00:56:57,889 --> 00:56:58,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Sort of there.

792
00:57:00,604 --> 00:57:01,806
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

793
00:57:16,187 --> 00:57:19,412
[SPEAKER_10]: The R4 is a flash cartridge that works on the DS.

794
00:57:19,532 --> 00:57:22,838
[SPEAKER_10]: You can use homebrew or pirated games on the system.

795
00:57:23,919 --> 00:57:30,330
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's also ones called, like, I had a Ninja Pass was one that I had that doesn't work anymore.

796
00:57:32,272 --> 00:57:57,607
[SPEAKER_10]: but now Nintendo has really got a push on and got it with the Japanese government that the R4 is now illegal to sell in Japan actually like it's completely banned by the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry it was illegal to sell since 2009 but importing it is completely illegal now as far as

797
00:57:59,168 --> 00:58:00,489
[SPEAKER_10]: Other places that it's been banned.

798
00:58:00,529 --> 00:58:02,690
[SPEAKER_10]: It's now banned in France and the UK.

799
00:58:03,331 --> 00:58:08,354
[SPEAKER_10]: Amazon and eBay are no longer allowing this cartridge to be sold.

800
00:58:09,214 --> 00:58:16,279
[SPEAKER_10]: And different Australian distributors have been successfully sued by Nintendo.

801
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:23,904
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm assuming it's still pretty available in the age-old venue of discreet brown paper bags in lavatories.

802
00:58:24,364 --> 00:58:24,824
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably.

803
00:58:24,984 --> 00:58:25,465
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, probably.

804
00:58:26,005 --> 00:58:28,146
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if I wanted one, I could go get one.

805
00:58:28,606 --> 00:58:29,346
[SPEAKER_10]: There's ways to get it.

806
00:58:29,386 --> 00:58:30,447
[SPEAKER_10]: You can order them online.

807
00:58:31,247 --> 00:58:36,589
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's now specifically illegal to import them in Japan.

808
00:58:37,029 --> 00:58:40,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Not just sell them like it was the rule.

809
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:41,250
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't import it.

810
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:43,631
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you could, but you could go to jail.

811
00:58:44,918 --> 00:58:48,501
[SPEAKER_10]: or have them stare at you sternly and force you to kill yourself.

812
00:58:48,682 --> 00:59:00,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, probably a lot of it has to do with, you know, how out there you're being too because, like, in Australia, you weren't... I think it wasn't illegal to import the M-rated games because they had been banned in Australia.

813
00:59:00,072 --> 00:59:01,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I remember Mortal Kombat, the new one.

814
00:59:02,214 --> 00:59:09,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, isn't it, like, illegal to, like, send... I mean, now maybe it's not because of the whole new rating board but before it was, like, illegal to send a copy over there.

815
00:59:09,661 --> 00:59:10,001
[SPEAKER_04]: But, like...

816
00:59:11,062 --> 00:59:13,864
[SPEAKER_04]: How are they really going to find each and every person that does it?

817
00:59:13,964 --> 00:59:14,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that I'm encouraging it.

818
00:59:15,205 --> 00:59:17,487
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we all know why the R4 cart's being banned.

819
00:59:18,528 --> 00:59:20,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Although... You can still buy them, of course.

820
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:21,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course you can.

821
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:31,637
[SPEAKER_10]: We remember the beginning of 2010, there was that UK guy who went to jail for a year for importing 26,000 games to set up with an R4.

822
00:59:37,779 --> 00:59:41,802
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a difference between 26,000 games and me going on Craigslist.

823
00:59:42,302 --> 00:59:42,542
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

824
00:59:43,483 --> 00:59:47,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, regardless, if people want something badly enough, they're going to find a way to make it happen.

825
00:59:48,086 --> 00:59:51,529
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just that now it's officially a punishable crime.

826
00:59:52,409 --> 00:59:52,710
[SPEAKER_10]: The end.

827
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:56,012
[SPEAKER_04]: And Nintendo just wants to put more hurdles up.

828
00:59:56,612 --> 00:59:57,393
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to make it harder.

829
00:59:57,413 --> 00:59:59,254
[SPEAKER_10]: They want to protect their product.

830
00:59:59,815 --> 01:00:01,476
[SPEAKER_10]: They're certainly well within their rights to do it.

831
01:00:02,805 --> 01:00:03,185
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.

832
01:00:03,646 --> 01:00:11,832
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if you think about it, and I hate to say this, it was how easily replicated games were for Dreamcast that contributed to the Dreamcast failure.

833
01:00:12,272 --> 01:00:15,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo is already sitting kind of in a precarious position.

834
01:00:15,755 --> 01:00:15,955
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

835
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:18,537
[SPEAKER_10]: So, of course they're going to want to protect their investment.

836
01:00:18,908 --> 01:00:27,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is a bummer because, you know, the homebrew element of it, you want to embrace, you want to be able to say like, yeah, people should be able to run homebrew on it.

837
01:00:27,659 --> 01:00:36,129
[SPEAKER_04]: But unfortunately, 95% of people, I pulled that number completely out of my ass, aren't really using it for, well, they're using it for homebrew and other things, you know.

838
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:38,452
[SPEAKER_10]: See, I wanted to play fan translations.

839
01:00:40,237 --> 01:00:42,298
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, it's not in the cards.

840
01:00:42,318 --> 01:00:44,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Although technically that's illegal too, if you think about it.

841
01:00:44,798 --> 01:00:46,239
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well, they can bite my ass.

842
01:00:46,359 --> 01:00:46,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

843
01:00:47,079 --> 01:00:50,800
[SPEAKER_04]: That's always... I always feel like that too, and I've talked about this on the show.

844
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:52,701
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when I feel justified in piracy.

845
01:00:53,501 --> 01:00:54,902
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that's a controversial opinion.

846
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:57,402
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you may not agree with me there and what have you.

847
01:00:57,442 --> 01:01:01,964
[SPEAKER_04]: But if a company just isn't going to do it, then...

848
01:01:03,024 --> 01:01:08,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me just freaking get the translation version or, you know, let me get it from the other country.

849
01:01:08,407 --> 01:01:10,429
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I went off on this with Xenoblade.

850
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:22,516
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's people who really like a series that's going to put that fun, you know, that effort into it, you know, and it really should actually more send a signal to the companies that fans want this.

851
01:01:22,576 --> 01:01:26,479
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, like what happened with, crap, what was that game that was on the Wii?

852
01:01:27,059 --> 01:01:27,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Xenoblade.

853
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:28,300
[SPEAKER_10]: Xenoblade, yeah.

854
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:29,881
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course people wanted Xenoblade.

855
01:01:30,761 --> 01:01:32,503
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was already, you know, in English.

856
01:01:33,544 --> 01:01:34,805
[SPEAKER_10]: But no one really knew it.

857
01:01:34,825 --> 01:01:37,628
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they did it because, you know, they realized, hey, it's stupid.

858
01:01:37,848 --> 01:01:38,649
[SPEAKER_10]: People do want it.

859
01:01:41,091 --> 01:01:42,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, last story.

860
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:45,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Smart Strategy Smart Strategy

861
01:02:13,526 --> 01:02:16,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Frisbee seems to agree with us in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

862
01:02:16,988 --> 01:02:21,349
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't sell a product to a country, they can't complain about lost sales due to downloading.

863
01:02:21,869 --> 01:02:23,210
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that's a controversial opinion.

864
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:24,991
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it stinks, but I'm kind of like, you know what?

865
01:02:25,011 --> 01:02:25,851
[SPEAKER_10]: It's technically right.

866
01:02:26,051 --> 01:02:32,414
[SPEAKER_04]: The internet puts us in a more global community than companies want to sometimes acknowledge, and that's just the reality.

867
01:02:32,714 --> 01:02:35,615
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you feel so bad about it, why don't you freaking import it?

868
01:02:37,113 --> 01:02:40,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Import fees are so freaking expensive, though, and then region locking and all that crap.

869
01:02:40,995 --> 01:02:42,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's my Disaster, Dead, and Crisis?

870
01:02:43,537 --> 01:02:45,177
[SPEAKER_03]: There was another game that was in English.

871
01:02:45,458 --> 01:02:50,580
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's move on with more news.

872
01:02:51,481 --> 01:02:54,382
[SPEAKER_03]: So Sony's credit rating is kind of crap.

873
01:02:55,863 --> 01:02:57,504
[SPEAKER_03]: They're probably going to have to go to one of those...

874
01:02:58,084 --> 01:03:01,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Credit agencies that they advertise on TV, but not really.

875
01:03:02,766 --> 01:03:12,268
[SPEAKER_03]: So apparently one of the credit rating boards, I guess, out there, agencies, Fitch Ratings has rated them junk status.

876
01:03:12,729 --> 01:03:16,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, there was another company, I guess, Moody's, who I've never heard of.

877
01:03:17,110 --> 01:03:18,750
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually haven't heard either one of them.

878
01:03:19,231 --> 01:03:22,392
[SPEAKER_03]: They've dropped theirs to, I guess, one notch above junk.

879
01:03:22,492 --> 01:03:23,072
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess...

880
01:03:24,733 --> 01:03:27,575
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be some people.

881
01:03:28,235 --> 01:03:31,717
[SPEAKER_03]: Some may call this junk, but I call them treasures, I guess.

882
01:03:32,278 --> 01:03:37,001
[SPEAKER_03]: That level.

883
01:03:37,041 --> 01:03:44,946
[SPEAKER_03]: They said the downgrade reflects Fitch's belief that the meaningful recovery will be slow given the company's loss of technology, leadership, and key products.

884
01:03:45,346 --> 01:03:49,769
[SPEAKER_03]: High competition, weak economic conditions in developed markets, and the strong yen.

885
01:03:52,085 --> 01:03:53,246
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

886
01:03:53,846 --> 01:03:59,949
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a company saying that they're going to fail, and I guess we just have to wait for them to either do so or not.

887
01:04:00,049 --> 01:04:00,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Amix?

888
01:04:01,850 --> 01:04:02,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I correct, though?

889
01:04:02,631 --> 01:04:07,674
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm not upping up on all my financial world stuff, but I believe this doesn't mean Sony...

890
01:04:08,454 --> 01:04:15,899
[SPEAKER_04]: is failing, it means that the analysts believe it's going to tank because they see the downward trend.

891
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:24,805
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically saying, hey, banks that are lending Sony money, they're at more of a risk on not being able to pay those loans back.

892
01:04:26,226 --> 01:04:29,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though they're a big company, big companies file bankruptcy all the time.

893
01:04:30,689 --> 01:04:32,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Twinkies.

894
01:04:32,290 --> 01:04:37,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but also, how many of Sony's CEOs are giving themselves raises every four months?

895
01:04:39,639 --> 01:04:46,254
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, but also you're talking about more of a global company than Hostess was Sony's based in Japan, it's a very different culture there

896
01:04:46,624 --> 01:04:53,509
[SPEAKER_10]: True, but I mean, it's still, if they have sound business practices and deal ethically, then I think that they can turn around.

897
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:58,973
[SPEAKER_10]: What happened with Hostess was a pure bout of greed and poor regulation.

898
01:04:59,193 --> 01:05:02,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, one thing with Sony is that they're more than games, too.

899
01:05:02,515 --> 01:05:03,316
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to remember.

900
01:05:03,356 --> 01:05:11,862
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a whole lot of other facets of Sony, and even though their games may be doing okay, although I think people wish the PlayStation 3 were doing better, especially the Vita.

901
01:05:12,182 --> 01:05:13,663
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like they're not doing well on the Vita.

902
01:05:13,863 --> 01:05:36,151
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that they weren't doing well in just like some of the other fields like for example Sony phones aren't you know Ericsson's not really a big thing anymore TVs they everybody goes off brand and gets the the Black Friday $200 TVs however Toshiba and Panasonic and Samsung have really pushed in LG especially those brands have really surpassed Sony in quality though

903
01:05:36,371 --> 01:05:41,933
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think people are buying cameras as much anymore because now the cameras and camera phones are alright.

904
01:05:42,093 --> 01:05:46,954
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're multi-megapixel cameras and for a lot of people that's just enough.

905
01:05:46,974 --> 01:05:50,976
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't need anything dedicated to just a camera unless you're actually really into photography.

906
01:05:51,236 --> 01:05:52,576
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'll tell you this.

907
01:05:52,976 --> 01:05:58,358
[SPEAKER_10]: My iPhone camera is tons better than the Digital Rebel that my husband bought four years ago.

908
01:05:59,888 --> 01:06:04,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Dungeon Buster in our chat room, Sony has a lot of internal issues that contributed to their failure.

909
01:06:04,532 --> 01:06:06,594
[SPEAKER_04]: They have had a lot of shifting and things going on lately.

910
01:06:07,234 --> 01:06:12,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Bob Coffee says the strong yen is what's fucking Japanese companies bad, that exchange rate.

911
01:06:14,741 --> 01:06:20,926
[SPEAKER_04]: Dungeon Buster also clarifies his earlier comment saying all of their competitors hired who they tried to force into early retirement.

912
01:06:23,633 --> 01:06:30,358
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, we have to remember Sony is more than just games, but it's not like their games are performing, especially the Vita.

913
01:06:30,538 --> 01:06:34,260
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's not looking pretty for Sony right now.

914
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:41,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Another thing, too, is that companies in Japan don't have the rules regarding single types of products, too.

915
01:06:41,105 --> 01:06:45,989
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, for example, Toyota also makes housing siding.

916
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:48,651
[SPEAKER_10]: Takara makes toys and wine.

917
01:06:49,291 --> 01:06:54,055
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the companies are allowed to branch out into other areas and expand.

918
01:06:54,095 --> 01:07:01,241
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, how else, I think, could Nintendo go from a card company to a computer entertainment company?

919
01:07:02,562 --> 01:07:16,453
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think the point is, though, is that first of all, I agree with the comment regarding the strength of the yen, but especially when you're dealing on an international market with other economies that you're relying on that don't have as strong fundage

920
01:07:17,233 --> 01:07:19,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Then, yeah, you're going to run into a lot of problems on the exchange as well.

921
01:07:21,275 --> 01:07:28,597
[SPEAKER_04]: Since I brought up the Vita, I do want to remind people, if you've been neglecting your Vita, PlayStation Plus just came out on the Vita, and there was a 2.0 patch for everybody.

922
01:07:29,298 --> 01:07:32,059
[SPEAKER_04]: So just, you know, go turn on your Vita if you haven't in a while.

923
01:07:32,439 --> 01:07:34,840
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't play enough of this game to really review it this week.

924
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:35,840
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll talk about it next week.

925
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:39,722
[SPEAKER_04]: But my early impressions of Gravity Rush, which is one of the free games on Plus right now...

926
01:07:41,622 --> 01:07:43,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Neat.

927
01:07:43,383 --> 01:07:44,703
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really liking what I see.

928
01:07:44,923 --> 01:07:48,984
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like one of these games I'm like, I think people totally missed this.

929
01:07:49,024 --> 01:07:50,205
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I know it has its fans.

930
01:07:50,565 --> 01:07:52,605
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard some people talking about it on Twitter and so forth.

931
01:07:52,665 --> 01:07:56,206
[SPEAKER_04]: But more people should be talking about Gravity Rush.

932
01:07:56,266 --> 01:07:58,007
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty great from what I've played of it so far.

933
01:07:58,667 --> 01:08:01,948
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a free one on PlayStation Plus and the Uncharted game, of course.

934
01:08:01,968 --> 01:08:02,448
[SPEAKER_03]: And Wipeout.

935
01:08:02,548 --> 01:08:04,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Wipeout was one of the best looking games that launched.

936
01:08:06,929 --> 01:08:10,732
[SPEAKER_04]: and Tactics PSP, which, you know, some of you might not have even bothered to pick up or whatever.

937
01:08:10,772 --> 01:08:11,352
[SPEAKER_04]: It's free.

938
01:08:11,592 --> 01:08:14,154
[SPEAKER_04]: So PlayStation Plus on Vita, looking nice right now.

939
01:08:14,214 --> 01:08:18,677
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have a Vita and you happen to have PlayStation Plus, I would really urge you to go check that free shit out.

940
01:08:19,418 --> 01:08:27,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you don't want to, the 2.0 upgrade allows the wireless transmissions, which is one of those, duh, this thing should have been there in the beginning and all those features, which is great.

941
01:08:27,784 --> 01:08:29,245
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

942
01:08:29,918 --> 01:08:34,842
[SPEAKER_04]: and Shadow Next Gen does want to say in chat, actually, PlayStation is losing Sony money right now.

943
01:08:35,223 --> 01:08:36,604
[SPEAKER_04]: The Vita has hurt them a lot.

944
01:08:36,684 --> 01:08:43,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mentioned the Vita earlier and I just, the sales in Japan and the US and everywhere really don't look good.

945
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:53,999
[SPEAKER_03]: I think their opportunity with some of these games I think was that the company that worked on Resistance and did the Call of Duty Vita versions, it's

946
01:08:54,179 --> 01:08:55,799
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

947
01:09:18,405 --> 01:09:19,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Total crap.

948
01:09:19,885 --> 01:09:22,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's like, what happened to that?

949
01:09:22,366 --> 01:09:22,786
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it?

950
01:09:22,826 --> 01:09:28,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it Game Developers Conference or one of those where Sony just came out and said, we've got over 100 games coming to the Vita.

951
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:31,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are they?

952
01:09:33,309 --> 01:09:33,769
[SPEAKER_04]: What happened?

953
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:37,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy X, we're going to remake that.

954
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:37,910
[SPEAKER_04]: When?

955
01:09:39,951 --> 01:09:40,291
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

956
01:09:41,791 --> 01:09:42,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh.

957
01:09:42,151 --> 01:09:43,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Are people abandoning ship?

958
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:43,872
[SPEAKER_04]: What's happening?

959
01:09:44,152 --> 01:09:44,232
Oh.

960
01:09:45,714 --> 01:09:47,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Earth Defense Force 2017, Portable comes out.

961
01:10:02,552 --> 01:10:04,814
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

962
01:10:24,349 --> 01:10:27,650
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried playing that, and it's like, oh, hey, cool, it's not updating.

963
01:10:27,950 --> 01:10:29,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

964
01:10:30,011 --> 01:10:32,112
[SPEAKER_04]: It works all right for me.

965
01:10:33,072 --> 01:10:37,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I think I called it bubble wrap on last week's show, and that's pretty much what it is.

966
01:10:37,454 --> 01:10:38,615
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not really a game there.

967
01:10:38,675 --> 01:10:39,575
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just tap, tap, tap.

968
01:10:39,936 --> 01:10:41,616
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do combos.

969
01:10:42,497 --> 01:10:42,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

970
01:10:43,097 --> 01:10:45,998
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pressing squares to make them disappear.

971
01:10:46,058 --> 01:10:46,999
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not rocket science.

972
01:10:48,081 --> 01:10:49,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

973
01:11:06,405 --> 01:11:08,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, which is supposed to be a reinvention of Populous.

974
01:11:09,727 --> 01:11:18,833
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought, actually, I gotta be honest, as much as I think Curiosity is interesting and all, that was tacky as shit, having that Kickstarter in there.

975
01:11:19,673 --> 01:11:27,918
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't put it past Molyneux, though, you know, as the more I was thinking about it, I was like, that is so a thing for him to do.

976
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:30,519
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, I just found that tacky as shit.

977
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:31,340
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

978
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:40,106
[SPEAKER_04]: And regardless, I think it's neat that he's revisiting the Populous idea because I think that game in particular was a great game.

979
01:11:41,247 --> 01:11:44,149
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is something that he started a Kickstarter for.

980
01:11:44,349 --> 01:11:46,211
[SPEAKER_04]: It's available on, of course, Kickstarter.

981
01:11:47,752 --> 01:11:54,197
[SPEAKER_04]: They want 450,000 pounds to do the Rebirth of God games for PC only.

982
01:11:54,597 --> 01:11:56,058
[SPEAKER_04]: IOS, and Android.

983
01:11:57,340 --> 01:12:02,424
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can look at more details on the Kickstarter if you want about what all you can get from it.

984
01:12:02,804 --> 01:12:05,947
[SPEAKER_04]: But that is on his plate for games he wants to do.

985
01:12:06,467 --> 01:12:11,432
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that 22 Cans had these other games lined up.

986
01:12:11,492 --> 01:12:12,653
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember reading about one.

987
01:12:12,693 --> 01:12:16,176
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought the next game was supposed to be Cooperation or something was supposed to be the next game for 22 Cans.

988
01:12:16,796 --> 01:12:18,016
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know where this fits into it.

989
01:12:18,177 --> 01:12:25,239
[SPEAKER_04]: If this is like an actual 22... Because remember, 22 cans is because Molyneux's got 22 ideas for iOS games.

990
01:12:26,679 --> 01:12:27,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

991
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:29,420
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know where this fits into it.

992
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:34,042
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if this is one of the 22 or if this is like a bonus or what, but... No.

993
01:12:34,322 --> 01:12:35,742
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope it's as good as Populous.

994
01:12:35,802 --> 01:12:36,442
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's all I can say.

995
01:12:36,462 --> 01:12:37,423
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not giving him any money.

996
01:12:37,683 --> 01:12:37,783
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

997
01:12:39,375 --> 01:12:43,078
[SPEAKER_04]: I just... I was kind of turned off by the ad in Curiosity.

998
01:12:43,819 --> 01:12:46,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't... I can't explain it.

999
01:12:46,221 --> 01:12:47,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it just... It was tacky.

1000
01:12:48,683 --> 01:12:49,003
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1001
01:12:49,344 --> 01:12:51,065
[SPEAKER_04]: It turned me off to Curiosity, too.

1002
01:12:51,505 --> 01:12:52,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what we're tapping away at?

1003
01:12:52,947 --> 01:12:54,548
[SPEAKER_04]: The big mystery in advertisement?

1004
01:12:55,429 --> 01:12:55,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

1005
01:12:57,050 --> 01:12:57,771
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's move on.

1006
01:12:58,351 --> 01:12:58,812
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

1007
01:12:59,833 --> 01:13:01,214
[SPEAKER_10]: My computer just did something bizarre.

1008
01:13:01,334 --> 01:13:01,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on.

1009
01:13:02,835 --> 01:13:03,215
[SPEAKER_10]: There we go.

1010
01:13:04,076 --> 01:13:04,276
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1011
01:13:06,551 --> 01:13:18,621
[SPEAKER_10]: So, as was teased earlier when we talked to Bobby, there's a game that I'm super excited about that's coming out on the 3DS through the Nintendo eShop.

1012
01:13:19,301 --> 01:13:22,364
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is Space Harrier!

1013
01:13:23,164 --> 01:13:24,285
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay!

1014
01:13:25,366 --> 01:13:30,509
[SPEAKER_10]: Mind you, it's not like I think the Sega Ages one.

1015
01:13:30,689 --> 01:13:36,753
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a currently redone 3D version of Space Harrier.

1016
01:13:37,354 --> 01:13:40,396
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm pretty excited about that because it's one of my favorite games ever.

1017
01:13:41,196 --> 01:13:41,296
[SPEAKER_10]: And...

1018
01:13:42,637 --> 01:13:46,320
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd actually, I think I've put it as like number three on my top games list.

1019
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:52,204
[SPEAKER_10]: Like number one being The Guardian Legend, number two being Fantasy Zone, and number three being Space Harrier.

1020
01:13:53,505 --> 01:13:55,346
[SPEAKER_10]: So, welcome to the Fantasy Zone.

1021
01:13:55,806 --> 01:13:56,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Get ready.

1022
01:13:58,008 --> 01:13:59,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you gotta get a 3DS.

1023
01:14:01,390 --> 01:14:02,471
[SPEAKER_10]: You wanna know what's funny, Rob?

1024
01:14:02,791 --> 01:14:04,973
[SPEAKER_10]: I have about seven versions of Space Harrier at home.

1025
01:14:05,813 --> 01:14:06,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me you don't want this one.

1026
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:08,844
[SPEAKER_11]: One of my Sega Ages 1s.

1027
01:14:27,617 --> 01:14:29,758
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1028
01:14:45,166 --> 01:14:46,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much just a couple things.

1029
01:14:46,827 --> 01:14:50,149
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got the American Mensa Academy on the 3DS.

1030
01:14:51,949 --> 01:14:56,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Ratchet and Clank Full Frontal Assault on PS3.

1031
01:14:58,032 --> 01:15:00,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Kids Learn and Play Pets and Vets on the DS.

1032
01:15:03,374 --> 01:15:08,036
[SPEAKER_03]: And... I think that actually might be it.

1033
01:15:08,997 --> 01:15:09,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1034
01:15:12,018 --> 01:15:16,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Scribblenot's Unlimited on PC because I guess that wasn't ready to go yet.

1035
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:24,061
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, traveling to Japan, since it's a little different over there and they didn't really have Black Friday, you still have some games coming out in Japan.

1036
01:15:24,762 --> 01:15:33,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting on the Xbox 360, you have Darksiders 2 comes out as well as Love Tor, Love Toray probably, mint version in limited and regular editions.

1037
01:15:34,344 --> 01:15:36,685
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a sequel to Sweet.

1038
01:15:37,965 --> 01:15:41,126
[SPEAKER_10]: For a moment, I thought you said Toire, which means toilet.

1039
01:15:42,179 --> 01:15:42,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Love Toilet?

1040
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:43,300
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1041
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:45,741
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't think these girls are having fun in the Love Toilet.

1042
01:15:45,761 --> 01:15:46,881
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it says, Toray.

1043
01:15:46,901 --> 01:15:47,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Toray.

1044
01:15:48,042 --> 01:15:48,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1045
01:15:48,682 --> 01:15:50,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me read the little description for this.

1046
01:15:50,543 --> 01:15:51,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

1047
01:15:51,323 --> 01:15:52,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Go away, box art.

1048
01:15:52,044 --> 01:15:53,304
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go back to the description here.

1049
01:15:53,344 --> 01:15:55,285
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I would play a game called Love Toilet.

1050
01:15:56,666 --> 01:15:57,967
[SPEAKER_04]: You are faced with a new problem.

1051
01:15:57,987 --> 01:16:00,768
[SPEAKER_04]: The school wants you to win the National Dance Championship.

1052
01:16:01,088 --> 01:16:04,970
[SPEAKER_04]: The girls are not used to disciplined practices and the student club president is against you.

1053
01:16:05,410 --> 01:16:13,253
[SPEAKER_04]: The biggest problem, however, is that you enter the championship as pairs, and the girl you want to dance with would most certainly prefer pairing up with another girl than dancing with you.

1054
01:16:13,654 --> 01:16:17,475
[SPEAKER_04]: However, protecting the club is your job, so swallow your pride and dance on.

1055
01:16:17,755 --> 01:16:19,676
[SPEAKER_04]: This is like the plot to, like, Bring It On 3.

1056
01:16:21,437 --> 01:16:23,258
[SPEAKER_12]: Box description, gigantic soulless eyes.

1057
01:16:31,561 --> 01:16:31,961
[SPEAKER_12]: Kinda.

1058
01:16:32,742 --> 01:16:34,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's move on to the PlayStation 3.

1059
01:16:35,363 --> 01:16:41,265
[SPEAKER_04]: On the PlayStation 3, Darksiders 2 is there as well, as well as Power Smash 4 going into the Sega The Best collection.

1060
01:16:41,905 --> 01:16:46,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Shinsengoku Musou Online Ryujin Oranbu 5th Anniversary Pack.

1061
01:16:46,387 --> 01:16:50,269
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably just a repackaging of Shinsengoku.

1062
01:16:50,909 --> 01:16:54,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Sports Champions 2 makes its way to Japan on the 29th as well.

1063
01:16:55,030 --> 01:16:58,592
[SPEAKER_04]: And Dai 2G Super Robot Taisen Original Generations.

1064
01:16:59,412 --> 01:17:02,035
[SPEAKER_04]: in the regular and Blu-ray disc box.

1065
01:17:02,095 --> 01:17:04,037
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's probably one of them combo packs.

1066
01:17:05,238 --> 01:17:16,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking at the PlayStation Vita this week, Fate Stay Night, Power Smash 4, price reduction there as well, and Samurai and Dragons, Ryuzoku Kuren.

1067
01:17:17,623 --> 01:17:26,536
[SPEAKER_04]: as well as a new game called Totori no Atelier Plus, Arland no Renken Sushi 2 comes out over there as well.

1068
01:17:26,797 --> 01:17:31,483
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry to interrupt, but is Samurais and Dragons pretty much their version of Cowboys and Aliens?

1069
01:17:32,805 --> 01:17:33,585
[SPEAKER_04]: It very well might be.

1070
01:17:33,645 --> 01:17:34,005
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1071
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:34,366
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1072
01:17:34,726 --> 01:17:36,066
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard these Atelier games, though.

1073
01:17:36,086 --> 01:17:38,027
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one of them on PlayStation 3 out here.

1074
01:17:38,107 --> 01:17:40,188
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a few out on PlayStation 3 out here.

1075
01:17:40,268 --> 01:17:40,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at these two.

1076
01:17:41,908 --> 01:17:45,369
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think these two chicks who are embracing in this picture are wearing a top.

1077
01:17:45,990 --> 01:17:46,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Just pointing out.

1078
01:17:46,850 --> 01:17:47,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Or illegal.

1079
01:17:48,190 --> 01:17:48,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Or illegal.

1080
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:49,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

1081
01:17:49,731 --> 01:17:52,092
[SPEAKER_04]: They're embracing in a bathhouse, I'm sure.

1082
01:17:53,312 --> 01:17:55,373
[SPEAKER_04]: The graphics look pretty, though, outside of that picture.

1083
01:17:55,473 --> 01:17:56,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cel shading and all that.

1084
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:02,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Tatori brings her tools, her books, and everything colorful to the PS Vita.

1085
01:18:02,796 --> 01:18:05,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Forget about saving the world, you have more important business to attend to.

1086
01:18:06,278 --> 01:18:12,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Namely, collecting your ingredients, learning new recipes, creating powerful items, and completing missions set by the guild.

1087
01:18:13,041 --> 01:18:15,963
[SPEAKER_04]: In this game where you have a schedule to follow, every moment counts.

1088
01:18:16,363 --> 01:18:18,204
[SPEAKER_04]: You got served cross bring it on equals moe moe powa

1089
01:18:41,625 --> 01:18:44,006
[SPEAKER_04]: On the Wii U in Japan, not yet.

1090
01:18:44,267 --> 01:18:48,650
[SPEAKER_04]: December 8th is the big day, so we got another week to go before we talk about Wii U in Japan.

1091
01:18:49,310 --> 01:18:54,694
[SPEAKER_04]: But we can talk about the Nintendo 3DS and Naruto SD Powerful Shippuden.

1092
01:18:55,215 --> 01:18:57,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what would the week be without a Naruto game?

1093
01:18:57,677 --> 01:18:59,838
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Leighton Kaiju vs...

1094
01:19:00,779 --> 01:19:03,201
[SPEAKER_04]: and Gaikoten Saiban comes out for level 5.

1095
01:19:16,337 --> 01:19:18,920
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought this was a thing in development.

1096
01:19:19,001 --> 01:19:21,544
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't realize this was coming out in Japan now.

1097
01:19:21,564 --> 01:19:21,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1098
01:19:22,645 --> 01:19:23,827
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you watch the trailer for this?

1099
01:19:24,227 --> 01:19:26,010
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I did a long time ago now that you talk about it.

1100
01:19:26,030 --> 01:19:26,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty epic.

1101
01:19:27,472 --> 01:19:27,972
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty cool.

1102
01:19:29,134 --> 01:19:31,917
[SPEAKER_12]: Sort of semi-off topic, there is now a Phoenix Wright movie.

1103
01:19:32,418 --> 01:19:32,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, oh yeah.

1104
01:19:33,059 --> 01:19:33,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1105
01:19:35,061 --> 01:19:38,862
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully something will get here a little easier to obtain.

1106
01:19:39,622 --> 01:19:42,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess the internet's not much easier than that, but you know.

1107
01:19:43,904 --> 01:19:45,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's going to do it for Japanese releases.

1108
01:19:45,664 --> 01:19:47,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go over to the UK, DarkSakura.

1109
01:19:47,265 --> 01:19:49,746
[SPEAKER_10]: On the 26th, we have LEGO Lord of the Rings.

1110
01:19:49,866 --> 01:19:53,827
[SPEAKER_10]: On the 27th, we have Battlefield 3 Aftermath and Mass Effect 3 Omega!

1111
01:19:54,540 --> 01:19:57,563
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad that for DLC it gets its own release date.

1112
01:19:57,983 --> 01:19:58,984
[SPEAKER_10]: That just makes me so happy.

1113
01:19:59,664 --> 01:20:01,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they respect Mass Effect.

1114
01:20:02,847 --> 01:20:10,934
[SPEAKER_10]: On the 20th of November, Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition, Miyazmata on PC, and Stealth Bastard Deluxe.

1115
01:20:11,234 --> 01:20:13,075
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the best name, Stealth Bastard.

1116
01:20:13,876 --> 01:20:15,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Or maybe it'd be Stealth Bastard.

1117
01:20:16,999 --> 01:20:19,401
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, Eddie Izzard is to be believed.

1118
01:20:21,050 --> 01:20:36,217
[SPEAKER_10]: On the 29th, Aeroporter on 3DS, the 30th, Ben 10 Omniverse, Epic Mickey 2, The Power of 2, Far Cry 3, FIFA 13, Little Inferno, Warriors Orochi 3 Hyper, the Wii U, Zone of the Enders HD Collection.

1119
01:20:37,178 --> 01:20:43,001
[SPEAKER_10]: And let me see what I've got for if there's anything on December 1st.

1120
01:20:43,041 --> 01:20:43,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on.

1121
01:20:44,542 --> 01:20:46,383
[SPEAKER_10]: God, I can't believe it's already almost December.

1122
01:20:48,284 --> 01:20:48,924
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope, nothing until the 4th.

1123
01:20:50,782 --> 01:20:54,143
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, just a couple more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

1124
01:20:54,243 --> 01:20:54,903
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, Loki.

1125
01:20:55,463 --> 01:20:55,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1126
01:20:56,243 --> 01:20:59,584
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk a little bit about Telltale Games.

1127
01:21:00,024 --> 01:21:05,505
[SPEAKER_03]: And thankfully, it's not about them closing down, but actually, they're expanding starting spring 2013.

1128
01:21:07,025 --> 01:21:11,366
[SPEAKER_03]: And what they're going to do is, I guess, they're moving out of their current office.

1129
01:21:11,566 --> 01:21:15,767
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to, I guess, get an office that's almost twice as big.

1130
01:21:16,627 --> 01:21:36,100
[SPEAKER_03]: and right now they're looking to um up their staff by looks like 35 people um starting in March and April of 2013 and I guess um that's good news that they're doing well so they've got you know of course a lot of games out right now they just finished up the second season of walking or I guess

1131
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:38,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're working on the second season of Walking Dead.

1132
01:21:38,482 --> 01:21:39,924
[SPEAKER_03]: The first season just finished.

1133
01:21:40,564 --> 01:21:47,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it should be coming out on a disc retail version two weeks from now.

1134
01:21:49,253 --> 01:21:49,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty cool.

1135
01:21:53,913 --> 01:21:57,293
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear great things about The Walking Dead.

1136
01:21:57,513 --> 01:21:59,754
[SPEAKER_04]: I have heard so much good stuff about that.

1137
01:21:59,774 --> 01:22:03,135
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people saying that's the game of the year right there is The Walking Dead.

1138
01:22:03,595 --> 01:22:05,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I just haven't had a chance to play it.

1139
01:22:05,195 --> 01:22:07,016
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so much stuff going on right now.

1140
01:22:07,176 --> 01:22:10,297
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a new game every day.

1141
01:22:10,757 --> 01:22:14,378
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want to take the time to sit down and play The Walking Dead at some point.

1142
01:22:15,758 --> 01:22:20,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people on Twitter went so far as to say it is the best ending ever in a video game.

1143
01:22:21,556 --> 01:22:22,336
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1144
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:48,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Regardless, it sounds like it came out better than Jurassic Park.

1145
01:22:48,870 --> 01:22:50,492
[SPEAKER_04]: But to be fair, I didn't play that either.

1146
01:22:51,172 --> 01:22:52,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Now that song is stuck in my head.

1147
01:22:52,914 --> 01:22:54,456
[SPEAKER_04]: What, Jurassic Park is Frightening in the Dark?

1148
01:22:54,896 --> 01:22:57,559
[SPEAKER_10]: Jurassic Park is Frightening in the Dark.

1149
01:22:58,340 --> 01:22:58,680
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1150
01:22:59,901 --> 01:23:00,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1151
01:23:00,782 --> 01:23:05,887
[SPEAKER_04]: One more on Ubisoft and a comment they made this week about this current console generation.

1152
01:23:06,588 --> 01:23:10,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Ubisoft doesn't want the next console generation to go quite as long.

1153
01:23:11,552 --> 01:23:13,773
[SPEAKER_04]: This was in a talk with Polygon.

1154
01:23:14,434 --> 01:23:16,615
[SPEAKER_04]: I can never say this guy's name right.

1155
01:23:16,675 --> 01:23:17,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry in advance.

1156
01:23:17,556 --> 01:23:19,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Yves Guillemot?

1157
01:23:19,217 --> 01:23:19,958
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1158
01:23:19,978 --> 01:23:22,019
[SPEAKER_04]: It's French.

1159
01:23:22,059 --> 01:23:23,260
[SPEAKER_04]: How would you say that right there?

1160
01:23:24,341 --> 01:23:24,721
[SPEAKER_10]: Wimote?

1161
01:23:26,205 --> 01:23:26,745
[SPEAKER_04]: William Maltz?

1162
01:23:26,886 --> 01:23:30,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, because that's basically... Y.V.S.

1163
01:23:30,687 --> 01:23:31,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Guillemot.

1164
01:23:33,669 --> 01:23:34,689
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would be Yves.

1165
01:23:35,330 --> 01:23:37,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he's the CEO at Ubisoft.

1166
01:23:37,231 --> 01:23:37,411
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1167
01:23:37,491 --> 01:23:37,991
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Yves.

1168
01:23:38,071 --> 01:23:39,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha ha, I'm French.

1169
01:23:39,592 --> 01:23:39,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop it.

1170
01:23:40,352 --> 01:23:45,775
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, he's the CEO at Ubisoft, and he said that basically, you know, it's kind of taken a while for hardware to come out.

1171
01:23:46,935 --> 01:23:51,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Quote, we are used to the changing machines every five years.

1172
01:23:52,477 --> 01:23:59,259
[SPEAKER_04]: When a console is out for a long time, you don't take as much risks on totally new IPs because even if they are good, they don't sell as well.

1173
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:06,182
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of an interesting comment because Zombie U is an Ubisoft game on the Wii U.

1174
01:24:07,389 --> 01:24:08,030
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1175
01:24:27,873 --> 01:24:34,578
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's basically saying that when a console's out for a long time, you don't want to take risks because they don't sell as well.

1176
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:41,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the reason that it feels like this cycle has gone on way too long?

1177
01:24:41,924 --> 01:24:44,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is that the rise of the mobile phone industry?

1178
01:24:44,206 --> 01:24:44,787
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.

1179
01:24:45,487 --> 01:24:49,851
[SPEAKER_04]: I really get bothered though when I keep seeing like, oh, traditional game companies.

1180
01:24:50,191 --> 01:24:52,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw one article somewhere this week that was like,

1181
01:24:52,873 --> 01:24:53,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

1182
01:25:12,466 --> 01:25:15,609
[SPEAKER_04]: The Apple iPhone cannot game the way a console can.

1183
01:25:15,629 --> 01:25:19,794
[SPEAKER_10]: When I get Mass Effect fully on my phone, maybe, but Infiltrator doesn't cut it.

1184
01:25:20,214 --> 01:25:22,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Infiltrator kind of sucks.

1185
01:25:22,156 --> 01:25:23,738
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it looks good, but the controls ruin it.

1186
01:25:23,758 --> 01:25:26,141
[SPEAKER_04]: I touched it, but... The controls ruin it.

1187
01:25:26,341 --> 01:25:27,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Rob, I touched it.

1188
01:25:29,584 --> 01:25:29,744
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

1189
01:25:34,068 --> 01:25:38,391
[SPEAKER_04]: How can the next console generation be shorter?

1190
01:25:38,411 --> 01:25:42,434
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to sell consoles saying, oh, well, we'll have a new one out in just four years.

1191
01:25:42,855 --> 01:25:48,119
[SPEAKER_04]: They kind of want to encourage people that this next console may have to be the last one they ever buy.

1192
01:25:48,991 --> 01:25:50,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Although we all know that's not true.

1193
01:25:50,231 --> 01:25:52,192
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you'll still be upgrading your PCs.

1194
01:25:52,652 --> 01:25:58,434
[SPEAKER_04]: But even, you know, Alan kind of made a point the other day that even PC upgrades have kind of slowed a little bit.

1195
01:25:59,095 --> 01:26:03,576
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, especially like now versus maybe where we were at 10 years ago in like the same time.

1196
01:26:03,856 --> 01:26:06,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's, you know, we've kind of hit this cap.

1197
01:26:08,158 --> 01:26:08,458
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1198
01:26:09,938 --> 01:26:10,218
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1199
01:26:11,419 --> 01:26:14,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Wolf in our chat room says, gaming on my TV will never die.

1200
01:26:16,661 --> 01:26:17,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Amen to that.

1201
01:26:18,727 --> 01:26:19,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I fucking hate that show.

1202
01:26:19,969 --> 01:26:20,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I also hate Sons of Anarchy.

1203
01:26:36,287 --> 01:26:38,609
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, yeah, okay, the acting in both are great.

1204
01:26:38,910 --> 01:26:40,231
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate the subject matter.

1205
01:26:40,831 --> 01:26:42,152
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate how the episodes go.

1206
01:26:42,273 --> 01:26:48,939
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate basically awful, horrible people being put in a positive spotlight.

1207
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:54,203
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, okay, yeah, Hitler was an artist, but that doesn't mean I'm a fan.

1208
01:26:55,384 --> 01:26:58,007
[SPEAKER_12]: Painting an apartment in one afternoon, two coats.

1209
01:27:00,389 --> 01:27:01,970
[SPEAKER_04]: I only have time to watch RuPaul's Drag Race.

1210
01:27:02,450 --> 01:27:02,730
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1211
01:27:04,951 --> 01:27:12,214
[SPEAKER_04]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on vognetwork.com, use the passphrase mouse.

1212
01:27:13,295 --> 01:27:16,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's travel to a time when we didn't even have these mobile phones.

1213
01:27:16,976 --> 01:27:19,177
[SPEAKER_04]: They were called car phones, not mobile phones.

1214
01:27:19,197 --> 01:27:20,638
[SPEAKER_08]: Not even when this was out of date.

1215
01:27:21,789 --> 01:27:22,149
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

1216
01:27:37,862 --> 01:27:45,008
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think there's very many people that are going to judge you for doing another mother game.

1217
01:27:45,048 --> 01:27:48,470
[SPEAKER_10]: This series is beloved by a lot of people.

1218
01:28:07,867 --> 01:28:09,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I need to actually break out my copy and play it.

1219
01:28:11,391 --> 01:28:13,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I do have this game.

1220
01:28:14,174 --> 01:28:22,203
[SPEAKER_10]: But in Japan, it was Mother 2 Giga no Gyakushu, which I don't know what Gyakushu means, so somebody translate for me.

1221
01:28:22,904 --> 01:28:23,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I knew that once.

1222
01:28:25,406 --> 01:28:25,767
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably...

1223
01:28:27,288 --> 01:28:28,049
[SPEAKER_12]: Giggs Revenge.

1224
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:30,270
[SPEAKER_10]: Something like that.

1225
01:28:31,011 --> 01:28:36,434
[SPEAKER_10]: At any rate, when it came out with the Attract demo, there were two different names.

1226
01:28:36,554 --> 01:28:41,758
[SPEAKER_10]: One was Earthbound, The War Against Giygas, and the other one was Mother 2.

1227
01:28:44,260 --> 01:28:48,743
[SPEAKER_10]: However they've written it, G-Y-I-Y-G, that's a weird way to spell it, strikes back.

1228
01:28:50,524 --> 01:28:56,708
[SPEAKER_10]: It was designed by Shigesato Itoi, and it was actually the sequel to Mother.

1229
01:28:57,769 --> 01:29:00,112
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, he was the last boss in the game.

1230
01:29:00,132 --> 01:29:01,394
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why he's named that.

1231
01:29:03,097 --> 01:29:05,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, no, I know that was his name.

1232
01:29:05,741 --> 01:29:07,163
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't know why they spelled it that way.

1233
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:09,611
[SPEAKER_10]: because it's very weird.

1234
01:29:10,992 --> 01:29:26,745
[SPEAKER_10]: At any rate, the game was released on August 27, 1994 in Japan and in America as Earthbound on June 5, 1995 as a standalone, as not a sequel to anything because we didn't know.

1235
01:29:26,825 --> 01:29:28,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Who did we have to import back then, huh?

1236
01:29:29,027 --> 01:29:32,049
[SPEAKER_12]: We had Final Fantasy VI as Final Fantasy III.

1237
01:29:32,109 --> 01:29:32,689
[SPEAKER_12]: Come on.

1238
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:33,190
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1239
01:29:33,210 --> 01:29:33,290
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1240
01:29:34,810 --> 01:29:38,071
[SPEAKER_10]: and then we had our Spoonie Bards in Final Fantasy 2-4.

1241
01:29:38,492 --> 01:29:41,453
[SPEAKER_12]: Our beloved boldlerized translations.

1242
01:29:42,033 --> 01:29:44,994
[SPEAKER_12]: It's actually evident in a few places in Earthbound.

1243
01:29:45,415 --> 01:29:55,639
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, there's a sequence fairly close to the beginning where they replaced a, you know, beating sound with a scolding sound and, you know, that's, you know, your nemesis, basically.

1244
01:29:55,679 --> 01:30:01,161
[SPEAKER_12]: He comes home and he gets his ass whipped by his parents, thus, you know, launching into the game proper, I think.

1245
01:30:01,602 --> 01:30:01,902
Mm-hmm.

1246
01:30:03,622 --> 01:30:06,764
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the game did not sell very well when it was new.

1247
01:30:07,684 --> 01:30:21,811
[SPEAKER_10]: However, everyone loved it because they really liked the satire of American culture and the different parodies showing up for the RPG genre.

1248
01:30:22,451 --> 01:30:25,073
[SPEAKER_12]: It's so quintessentially Japanese.

1249
01:30:25,213 --> 01:30:28,254
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, there's just something so unique about it.

1250
01:30:28,314 --> 01:30:31,916
[SPEAKER_12]: You could not have something like Mr. Saturn in an American game.

1251
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:33,581
[SPEAKER_10]: That's true.

1252
01:30:34,302 --> 01:30:39,088
[SPEAKER_10]: I like Mr. Saturn in Smash Brothers because you can hit people with him.

1253
01:30:39,949 --> 01:30:40,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the cultist.

1254
01:30:40,930 --> 01:30:42,432
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my favorite part of the game.

1255
01:30:42,473 --> 01:30:42,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, yes.

1256
01:30:42,833 --> 01:30:43,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.

1257
01:30:43,854 --> 01:30:44,996
[SPEAKER_12]: That shit was hilarious.

1258
01:30:45,537 --> 01:30:46,898
[SPEAKER_12]: Or a boss made out of vomit.

1259
01:30:47,259 --> 01:30:47,519
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean...

1260
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:51,582
[SPEAKER_10]: I do like running around in your pajamas, but in the original, you were naked.

1261
01:30:51,882 --> 01:30:52,223
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yes.

1262
01:30:52,843 --> 01:30:56,465
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's just such a unique game.

1263
01:30:56,585 --> 01:30:58,507
[SPEAKER_12]: That's one of the things that drew me toward it.

1264
01:31:00,728 --> 01:31:08,853
[SPEAKER_10]: They had a sequel planned for the Nintendo 64DD, which was Earthbound 64, and it had been in development for a while before it was cancelled.

1265
01:31:09,434 --> 01:31:13,296
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it came out as a GBA game called Mother 3.

1266
01:31:13,596 --> 01:31:14,617
[SPEAKER_10]: It only came out in Japan.

1267
01:31:15,077 --> 01:31:23,462
[SPEAKER_10]: However, there are fan translations, and it does have a very loose connection to Mother 2, but you can play it on its own.

1268
01:31:24,162 --> 01:31:25,523
[SPEAKER_10]: There's actually a few returning characters.

1269
01:31:26,143 --> 01:31:31,766
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, and you know, playing the prequel to it does make for a much richer experience.

1270
01:31:31,866 --> 01:31:34,267
[SPEAKER_12]: It will punch you in the emotions, I assure you.

1271
01:31:35,068 --> 01:31:35,988
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll get you in the feels.

1272
01:31:36,268 --> 01:31:36,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1273
01:31:37,789 --> 01:31:43,454
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, it actually uses a kind of different sort of projection for playing the game.

1274
01:31:43,534 --> 01:31:53,581
[SPEAKER_10]: It uses what's called oblique projection instead of the top-down, so that you're sort of skewed on a different level with all of the things around it.

1275
01:31:54,642 --> 01:32:05,070
[SPEAKER_10]: So it gives the world, even though it is purely 2D, it gives it some sort of... It really makes it seamless as you go from place to place.

1276
01:32:05,510 --> 01:32:09,833
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I think Pokemon uses kind of a similar... Pretty similar, yeah, style.

1277
01:32:10,994 --> 01:32:18,760
[SPEAKER_10]: But I really liked its use of the color palette on the SNES, because I thought it was just gorgeous.

1278
01:32:19,081 --> 01:32:19,881
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yes, yes.

1279
01:32:20,922 --> 01:32:23,504
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not just color, it's how they use it.

1280
01:32:23,524 --> 01:32:27,527
[SPEAKER_10]: It also doesn't use random encounters like the first Mother game did.

1281
01:32:27,787 --> 01:32:28,968
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.

1282
01:32:29,209 --> 01:32:32,191
[SPEAKER_12]: And it is not every three steps like the original Mother.

1283
01:32:32,891 --> 01:32:33,051
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1284
01:32:34,132 --> 01:32:40,054
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so basically, you know, you beat them down to zero, they, you know, for their hit points, they get killed.

1285
01:32:40,454 --> 01:32:44,275
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you defeat a specific type of enemy, there's a chance you'll get an item.

1286
01:32:44,935 --> 01:32:47,776
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, my favorite part about it was the rolling counter.

1287
01:32:48,216 --> 01:32:52,617
[SPEAKER_12]: You, you know, you could get mortally hit and still finish a fight and live.

1288
01:32:53,237 --> 01:33:00,199
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you gave yourself enough time, especially towards the end when you're, you know, upwards of 300 life, you know, that was pretty sweet.

1289
01:33:02,019 --> 01:33:06,321
[SPEAKER_10]: I like how it compares your hit points box to an odometer.

1290
01:33:07,141 --> 01:33:14,523
[SPEAKER_10]: And then of course you had your psi attacks that used your psychic points.

1291
01:33:16,464 --> 01:33:17,644
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess PK fire.

1292
01:33:19,806 --> 01:33:22,429
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard that way too many times playing Smash Bros.

1293
01:33:22,710 --> 01:33:23,431
[SPEAKER_10]: PK Fire!

1294
01:33:23,551 --> 01:33:24,192
[SPEAKER_10]: PK Fire!

1295
01:33:36,429 --> 01:33:39,492
[SPEAKER_10]: And except for one character named Pooh, who can use a sword.

1296
01:33:40,473 --> 01:33:41,794
[SPEAKER_12]: But that was only way at the end.

1297
01:33:41,854 --> 01:33:45,177
[SPEAKER_12]: Towards, you know, for most of the game, he's just using his fists.

1298
01:33:45,217 --> 01:33:46,718
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is like, what, a 12-year-old?

1299
01:33:47,178 --> 01:33:48,740
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, give him props for that.

1300
01:33:50,001 --> 01:33:51,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, when you're fighting, vomit.

1301
01:33:52,763 --> 01:33:55,085
[SPEAKER_12]: And miniaturized UFOs wearing bows and...

1302
01:33:56,354 --> 01:33:57,494
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, all sorts of critters.

1303
01:33:57,934 --> 01:33:59,935
[SPEAKER_10]: You had all kinds of neat places in the game, too.

1304
01:33:59,955 --> 01:34:07,137
[SPEAKER_10]: You had Onet, you know, Tucson, Threed, Foreside, you know, they were named.

1305
01:34:07,297 --> 01:34:15,139
[SPEAKER_10]: You also had Winters, Summers, and Dalam, Scaraba, you know, different places that were meant to mimic different areas.

1306
01:34:15,199 --> 01:34:16,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Highly creative names.

1307
01:34:16,460 --> 01:34:16,800
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1308
01:34:20,223 --> 01:34:23,526
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you had to beat the Starmen and everything.

1309
01:34:24,307 --> 01:34:27,130
[SPEAKER_10]: What I really like is looking at the concept art for this game.

1310
01:34:27,751 --> 01:34:29,973
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you've ever seen any of the concept art for this.

1311
01:34:30,093 --> 01:34:32,555
[SPEAKER_12]: It's quite whimsical and just making it beautiful.

1312
01:34:32,596 --> 01:34:34,658
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes me think of a child's storybook.

1313
01:34:35,018 --> 01:34:35,899
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yes, especially.

1314
01:34:35,919 --> 01:34:37,661
[SPEAKER_10]: This would be a fucked up story.

1315
01:34:39,342 --> 01:34:45,345
[SPEAKER_12]: My favorite was always Dungeon Man because you could see this really whimsical turn to it.

1316
01:34:45,885 --> 01:34:47,886
[SPEAKER_12]: There's so much detail in it and so much life.

1317
01:34:48,006 --> 01:34:50,527
[SPEAKER_12]: This is such a life-affirming game.

1318
01:34:50,667 --> 01:34:52,888
[SPEAKER_12]: That's one reason I always went back to it.

1319
01:34:56,890 --> 01:35:01,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Part of the dialogue for the final battle in this was actually...

1320
01:35:03,392 --> 01:35:08,617
[SPEAKER_10]: I was reading, because this is something that I'd read before, about the military policemen and the dismembered beauty.

1321
01:35:09,158 --> 01:35:21,369
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, and it's not actually a rape scene, as is often misquoted, but it's a sex scene which turns into a murder scene, which, you know, is not, it's not really a point for splitting many hairs, but...

1322
01:35:21,989 --> 01:35:28,658
[SPEAKER_10]: But Itoi said that it had such an impact on him that he incorporated it into the game.

1323
01:35:28,759 --> 01:35:30,541
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and it works really well.

1324
01:35:30,601 --> 01:35:36,970
[SPEAKER_12]: It's very disjointed and it's kind of horrifying because there's just this sense of out-of-placeness there that you don't get in many games.

1325
01:35:37,350 --> 01:35:44,075
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that when they marketed this in Japan, they actually used a member of SMOP to advertise the game.

1326
01:35:45,235 --> 01:35:48,337
[SPEAKER_10]: They had scratches of stickers that came out with it.

1327
01:35:48,377 --> 01:35:53,141
[SPEAKER_10]: They did all kinds of stuff with Weekly Famitsu to promote the hell out of this game.

1328
01:35:53,181 --> 01:35:55,662
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, sadly, it didn't sell up to expectations.

1329
01:35:56,303 --> 01:36:03,928
[SPEAKER_10]: But in America, it sold 140,000 copies and twice that many in Japan, which is still not all that great.

1330
01:36:04,008 --> 01:36:05,969
[SPEAKER_10]: Not for how SNES games were selling at the time.

1331
01:36:07,730 --> 01:36:10,632
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's like many things that are underappreciated when they're new.

1332
01:36:11,312 --> 01:36:13,113
[SPEAKER_10]: They go back and get that cult status.

1333
01:36:13,533 --> 01:36:13,873
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yes.

1334
01:36:14,774 --> 01:36:18,896
[SPEAKER_10]: And now, you know, it's just considered one of the top games ever.

1335
01:36:20,137 --> 01:36:24,939
[SPEAKER_10]: In 2006, there was a pull in Famitsu and it was rated the 37th best game of all time out of 100.

1336
01:36:24,999 --> 01:36:31,963
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was listed from Gamasutra as one of the top 20 essential Japanese RPGs.

1337
01:36:33,041 --> 01:36:40,950
[SPEAKER_04]: I really love this game for the record because, you know, and I remember playing this, I rented this at least like four times from the store and stuff like that, just playing the shit out of it.

1338
01:36:42,932 --> 01:36:52,663
[SPEAKER_04]: One reason I really liked it is that, you know, I was really into Final Fantasy and all those games on Super Nintendo and this was very kind of, it was like that, but very, like it wasn't swords and sorcery and stuff, it was just like...

1339
01:36:53,183 --> 01:36:55,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Kids being stupid, and I loved that.

1340
01:36:55,524 --> 01:37:02,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it was very cartoonish, like the most cartoony thing you could really play on the Super Nintendo at the time, but yet it was like this Final Fantasy RPG.

1341
01:37:03,406 --> 01:37:04,707
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I always really loved about it.

1342
01:37:05,227 --> 01:37:07,147
[SPEAKER_10]: I really should break out my copy again and play it.

1343
01:37:07,327 --> 01:37:07,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Good times.

1344
01:37:08,568 --> 01:37:12,049
[SPEAKER_10]: But, yeah, I actually have, I believe this is one of the ones I have in the box.

1345
01:37:13,009 --> 01:37:15,850
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to admit, I came into this afterwards.

1346
01:37:16,150 --> 01:37:17,851
[SPEAKER_12]: This was not one of the ones we had on the console.

1347
01:37:17,871 --> 01:37:23,132
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually completed this on emulator, so sorry if that disqualifies me as a serious gamer.

1348
01:37:23,472 --> 01:37:26,513
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of people at this point have discovered it that way.

1349
01:37:26,533 --> 01:37:28,654
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really hard to find it for less than $60.

1350
01:37:30,314 --> 01:37:47,763
[SPEAKER_12]: But at the same time, I feel kind of glad that it's found such popularity on an emulator because it has reached a much wider audience and it does make for a richer experience that you can get it out to different people and you find all these little secrets and things you hadn't seen before.

1351
01:37:47,803 --> 01:37:48,763
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you see the embryos?

1352
01:37:50,174 --> 01:37:53,259
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, in the very last stage... I've seen that, yeah, but you know what?

1353
01:37:53,339 --> 01:37:55,021
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think that is intentional.

1354
01:37:55,061 --> 01:37:56,904
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, I don't think that's an intentional design thing.

1355
01:37:56,924 --> 01:38:01,931
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a bit like, you know, the backwards tribute to Satan in a Led Zeppelin song.

1356
01:38:01,972 --> 01:38:04,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but I could... But given Itoi's...

1357
01:38:06,599 --> 01:38:07,060
[SPEAKER_10]: History?

1358
01:38:07,420 --> 01:38:09,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe I could see it happening.

1359
01:38:09,604 --> 01:38:11,887
[SPEAKER_12]: I just don't know how you intentionally get that.

1360
01:38:12,147 --> 01:38:14,390
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it's not just one static image.

1361
01:38:14,451 --> 01:38:16,413
[SPEAKER_12]: It's sort of a rolling thing.

1362
01:38:16,514 --> 01:38:17,074
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a tile.

1363
01:38:18,476 --> 01:38:19,838
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's moving.

1364
01:38:20,319 --> 01:38:21,160
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't know.

1365
01:38:23,354 --> 01:38:36,727
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, at any rate, for other things that have happened with the series, of course, definitely Ness and other characters have shown up in the Super Smash Bros.

1366
01:38:36,767 --> 01:38:37,167
[SPEAKER_10]: series.

1367
01:38:39,389 --> 01:38:42,172
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Ness was a hidden character, but everyone freaking used him.

1368
01:38:42,812 --> 01:38:53,659
[SPEAKER_10]: and, um, Onet was actually a stage in Brawl and New Pork City in Mother 3 showed up in Brawl as well with the Chimera to the rejoice of all who wanted to see it in 3D.

1369
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:54,280
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1370
01:38:55,241 --> 01:39:02,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, there were also trophies for Paula, Jeff, and Pooh and, um, Jeff is an assist trophy in Super Smash Bros.

1371
01:39:02,686 --> 01:39:12,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Brawl and, uh, his, uh, multi-bottle rockets were involved as well and Mr. Saturn, you could throw him at people because that was awesome.

1372
01:39:13,232 --> 01:39:15,913
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, why was, Mr. Saturn should have been our Pikachu.

1373
01:39:16,653 --> 01:39:26,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Saturn, however, you got special, um, it was like, you got an achievement for Mr. Saturn love, or you got points for it, when you let him wander around the screen and didn't throw him at people.

1374
01:39:28,236 --> 01:39:29,017
[SPEAKER_10]: I always thought it was funny.

1375
01:39:29,297 --> 01:39:30,817
[SPEAKER_12]: And Mr. Saturn only wants to help.

1376
01:39:31,437 --> 01:39:34,178
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't help it that he's just a butt on legs, with a bow.

1377
01:39:35,258 --> 01:39:36,039
[SPEAKER_12]: A butt on, yeah.

1378
01:39:37,279 --> 01:39:48,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, at any rate, like I said earlier, there was supposed to be a sequel in 96 on the 64DD, but it kept having production problems and didn't show at E3 and other gaming conventions.

1379
01:39:48,443 --> 01:39:56,466
[SPEAKER_10]: So Nintendo cancelled it on August 21st, 2000, but it resurfaced as a GBA title and it was only released in Japan.

1380
01:39:57,106 --> 01:40:01,208
[SPEAKER_10]: And also Itoi said he had no more plans to develop the series any further.

1381
01:40:02,328 --> 01:40:08,116
[SPEAKER_10]: There was an ESRB rating that said that it might come out on Wii but there are still no official plans.

1382
01:40:09,306 --> 01:40:21,651
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want to give further props to the fan translation community because in their fight to translate this, they also found a lot of cool, like, kind of unused things.

1383
01:40:22,172 --> 01:40:25,593
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, just sort of, you know, artifacts that were left in the data.

1384
01:40:26,013 --> 01:40:26,193
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

1385
01:40:26,354 --> 01:40:27,554
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, unfortunately, no.

1386
01:40:27,654 --> 01:40:38,259
[SPEAKER_12]: Just things that, you know, unused bosses and unused sprites that just, they make you wonder at how, you know, what was originally planned for this because, you know, there were a few places...

1387
01:40:39,619 --> 01:40:43,721
[SPEAKER_12]: The creator said he actually had to scale it back a bit because it was frightening him.

1388
01:40:44,341 --> 01:40:49,983
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm of course referring to the extended mushroom trip, like sort of halfway through the game.

1389
01:40:50,043 --> 01:40:54,324
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually need to sit down and play level 3 because I just haven't had time.

1390
01:40:54,564 --> 01:40:58,125
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, there's an extended mushroom trip and the final boss.

1391
01:40:58,145 --> 01:40:59,386
[SPEAKER_12]: I like extended mushroom trips.

1392
01:40:59,446 --> 01:41:04,808
[SPEAKER_12]: The final boss, there is an unused boss battle, which I think it's available on YouTube, which...

1393
01:41:06,068 --> 01:41:10,090
[SPEAKER_12]: is deeply unsettling, despite my lack of understanding Japanese.

1394
01:41:11,031 --> 01:41:17,954
[SPEAKER_12]: But as it stands, the Mother 3 game is a very emotionally engaging and rich game, I find.

1395
01:41:18,414 --> 01:41:24,297
[SPEAKER_12]: It's got its predecessor's balance of horror and just awesomeness.

1396
01:41:25,618 --> 01:41:28,079
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this also I think is kind of cool.

1397
01:41:28,299 --> 01:41:37,083
[SPEAKER_10]: The sound designer for Earthbound, Keiichi Suzuki, he actually said that the biggest influence for the music for him was John Lennon.

1398
01:41:37,904 --> 01:41:38,304
[SPEAKER_10]: Excellent.

1399
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:41,801
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, in the YouTube we're watching here, I just saw a reference to the Beatles.

1400
01:41:42,161 --> 01:41:43,602
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like one of those funny little jokes.

1401
01:41:43,642 --> 01:41:47,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, do you know the name of this Beatles song?

1402
01:41:47,603 --> 01:41:49,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Blank, blank, blank, today.

1403
01:41:49,664 --> 01:41:51,364
[SPEAKER_04]: And your options are yes and no.

1404
01:41:51,484 --> 01:41:54,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's a funny joke because you can say yes.

1405
01:41:54,605 --> 01:41:55,005
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right.

1406
01:41:55,105 --> 01:41:55,766
[SPEAKER_04]: It's yesterday.

1407
01:41:55,786 --> 01:41:56,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

1408
01:41:56,986 --> 01:42:02,568
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, music references, sadly, are one of the reasons they'd have trouble releasing Mother 3 in the U.S.

1409
01:42:03,309 --> 01:42:07,831
[SPEAKER_12]: Because there is the Runaway 5 in Earthbound.

1410
01:42:08,151 --> 01:42:13,833
[SPEAKER_12]: It was actually originally kind of a Blues Brother-y tribute, which it's kind of evident in the finished product of the game.

1411
01:42:13,913 --> 01:42:18,495
[SPEAKER_12]: But I can't remember, it's the DMC or something like that?

1412
01:42:18,975 --> 01:42:19,456
[SPEAKER_10]: There's Pinball.

1413
01:42:19,476 --> 01:42:20,016
[SPEAKER_10]: I just called Pinball.

1414
01:42:20,056 --> 01:42:20,876
[SPEAKER_10]: I forgot there were Pinball.

1415
01:42:20,896 --> 01:42:21,837
[SPEAKER_10]: There's Pinball in the arcade.

1416
01:42:21,897 --> 01:42:22,237
[SPEAKER_10]: Sweet.

1417
01:42:23,021 --> 01:42:29,403
[SPEAKER_12]: but there's also the band in Mother 3 is also kind of clearly ripped off another band.

1418
01:42:32,404 --> 01:42:33,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's the game.

1419
01:42:34,305 --> 01:42:38,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Mother 2 slash Earthbound with strong hints towards Mother 3.

1420
01:42:40,387 --> 01:42:42,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

1421
01:42:42,148 --> 01:42:47,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Earthbound, Mother 2 and a little dash of Mother 3 but we have to save that for another week.

1422
01:42:47,150 --> 01:42:48,450
[SPEAKER_10]: We should do a Gaiden version called Daddy.

1423
01:42:50,612 --> 01:42:52,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, that's going to do it for Part A, but don't go anywhere.

1424
01:42:52,954 --> 01:42:53,996
[SPEAKER_04]: We have plenty more to come.

1425
01:42:54,176 --> 01:42:56,779
[SPEAKER_04]: We may not have a whole lot of news, but we do have the rapid-fire news.

1426
01:42:57,139 --> 01:43:04,968
[SPEAKER_04]: We have your Fugo Question of the Week coming up as well, Mailbag, and Match Game coming back tonight in Part B. Don't go anywhere, guys.

1427
01:43:04,988 --> 01:43:08,292
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1428
01:43:14,423 --> 01:43:23,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live here on November the 25th of 2012 with the 483rd episode of our show.

1429
01:43:24,032 --> 01:43:27,836
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit of a slower news week this week, but that's alright.

1430
01:43:27,896 --> 01:43:33,581
[SPEAKER_04]: We still have some news stories to talk about, including the rapid fire news, which is coming up right now.

1431
01:43:33,821 --> 01:43:34,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1432
01:43:34,082 --> 01:43:34,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1433
01:43:34,782 --> 01:43:34,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1434
01:43:35,523 --> 01:43:39,806
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk about my favorite gaming series, Grand Theft Auto.

1435
01:43:40,386 --> 01:43:47,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Grand Theft Auto had a wonderful release on iOS and Android of Grand Theft Auto 3 celebrating the 10th anniversary earlier this year.

1436
01:43:47,852 --> 01:43:49,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe even been last year, can't remember.

1437
01:43:50,233 --> 01:44:02,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but, soon enough, you'll be able to get some more Grand Theft Auto Love on your portable devices with Grand Theft Auto Vice City, the HD treatment for the 10th anniversary of that game as well.

1438
01:44:03,002 --> 01:44:07,184
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm hoping that San Andreas is only a couple more years away.

1439
01:44:08,025 --> 01:44:17,471
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, that'll be available on, um, December 6th, and apparently it's gonna cost you $5 on, uh, both Android or iOS.

1440
01:44:19,690 --> 01:44:20,971
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fantastic.

1441
01:44:21,391 --> 01:44:22,451
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot wait.

1442
01:44:23,311 --> 01:44:25,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Except I can, because I'm not actually going to play it on the phone.

1443
01:44:26,893 --> 01:44:29,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Because gaming on the phone sucks.

1444
01:44:30,574 --> 01:44:42,359
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, to kind of go along with that, there's kind of a fan campaign to try to get Grand Theft Auto V onto PC and the Wii U. And, of course, developers are like, well, they're...

1445
01:44:42,779 --> 01:45:02,374
[SPEAKER_03]: anything is up for consideration of course they haven't announced anything and um you know right now they're mainly focused on getting the game out on you know the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 it's hard to say if there's actually going to be a PC version for the game seeing as that you know there wasn't one for Red Dead Redemption although there was one for L.A.

1446
01:45:02,394 --> 01:45:07,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Noire so it's I don't know it'd be kind of cool if it was on PC because that game looks fantastic and

1447
01:45:10,498 --> 01:45:11,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Bayonetta DLC Japan

1448
01:45:40,757 --> 01:46:03,138
[SPEAKER_03]: is coming to North America however it's coming to North America as a GameStop exclusive and I guess it will be kind of a day one limited edition also in Europe the US you're going to have to wait until you know comes out in January and if you really want that DLC you're going to have to wait until you know wait and purchase it from GameStop

1449
01:46:04,139 --> 01:46:05,660
[SPEAKER_03]: And the game is supposed to be a lot cheaper.

1450
01:46:05,700 --> 01:46:08,543
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only $29.99 as opposed to a full price game.

1451
01:46:09,724 --> 01:46:14,788
[SPEAKER_03]: It is kind of disappointing though that GameStop locked in the DLC for that.

1452
01:46:15,368 --> 01:46:15,969
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate that.

1453
01:46:16,629 --> 01:46:16,949
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

1454
01:46:17,009 --> 01:46:17,670
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, never know.

1455
01:46:17,710 --> 01:46:18,991
[SPEAKER_03]: That stuff could come out later on.

1456
01:46:19,031 --> 01:46:19,912
[SPEAKER_03]: They could sell it later.

1457
01:46:20,312 --> 01:46:26,617
[SPEAKER_03]: But just, you know, throwing GameStop a bone, I guess, and giving them exclusive DLC.

1458
01:46:27,038 --> 01:46:27,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Not going to hold my breath.

1459
01:46:28,659 --> 01:46:28,779
Yeah.

1460
01:46:30,515 --> 01:46:31,635
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, moving on.

1461
01:46:32,156 --> 01:46:32,876
[SPEAKER_04]: This is pretty good.

1462
01:46:32,936 --> 01:46:37,158
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I know we've talked about some Vita hardships, but there's a lot of good stuff to talk about on Vita right now.

1463
01:46:37,258 --> 01:46:39,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just the free games, but price reductions.

1464
01:46:40,219 --> 01:46:45,681
[SPEAKER_04]: November 27th is going to see some price reductions on the PlayStation Network for the download.

1465
01:46:45,701 --> 01:46:51,143
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you have a memory card large enough to hold some games, you can get some games for a lot cheaper than they used to be for $17.99.

1466
01:46:53,384 --> 01:47:00,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Hot Shots Golf, Little Deviants, MLB 12 The Show, Mod Nation Racers, Reality Fighters, and Wipeout 2048.

1467
01:47:01,430 --> 01:47:06,173
[SPEAKER_04]: $26.99, Resistance Burning Skies, Smart Ass, not to be confused with Smart Ass, and Unit 13.

1468
01:47:06,713 --> 01:47:13,338
[SPEAKER_04]: And then $35.99 for Uncharted Golden Abyss, but as mentioned before, you could get that free with PlayStation Plus.

1469
01:47:13,358 --> 01:47:20,403
[SPEAKER_04]: You would just have to kind of juggle like, you know, remember when you are on PlayStation Plus, if you let your account lapse, you'll lose all those free games.

1470
01:47:20,803 --> 01:47:23,825
[SPEAKER_04]: So you kind of have to weigh, is that something I really want to be locked into?

1471
01:47:24,086 --> 01:47:31,711
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mind it, personally, because the games I'm getting for free aren't things that, like, if I really want a game bad enough that I can revisit whenever, I'll buy it.

1472
01:47:32,772 --> 01:47:37,515
[SPEAKER_04]: But I like that PlayStation Plus kind of allows me to play games I might have missed from a couple years ago.

1473
01:47:37,715 --> 01:47:38,756
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know.

1474
01:47:38,876 --> 01:47:45,181
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to sound like a mouthpiece for Sony, but I'm glad to see that they're reducing the price of some of these games.

1475
01:47:46,001 --> 01:47:47,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Might be what the system needs right now.

1476
01:47:48,803 --> 01:48:17,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Darkstalker Resurrection Some folks looking forward to this This is the Darkstalker games for Xbox Live and Playstation Network There's also going to be a new tournament and online tournament mode coming in the game This is according to Capcom Unity The online mode is going to support 8 players Sudden Death, One Takes All, Best of 2 or Best of 3 Resurrection will also include the usual ranked and player matches Resurrection of course being the name of this download game

1477
01:48:18,301 --> 01:48:18,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty cool there.

1478
01:48:19,201 --> 01:48:23,565
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can do replays on YouTube, so can't wait for YouTube to get flooded with this stuff.

1479
01:48:24,505 --> 01:48:25,186
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty cool.

1480
01:48:25,206 --> 01:48:30,430
[SPEAKER_04]: $14.99 on PlayStation Network, 1,200 Microsoft points on Xbox Live Arcade when it comes out in 2013.

1481
01:48:31,731 --> 01:48:35,834
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a fan of Half Minute Hero, maybe you're wondering when are we getting Half Minute Hero 2?

1482
01:48:36,895 --> 01:48:41,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, marvelous producer Esteban Salazar told Siliconera that...

1483
01:48:42,339 --> 01:48:49,701
[SPEAKER_04]: quote, it's considerably more expensive to put out the sequel, and they need to sell a lot more of the first game on PC to begin to justify it.

1484
01:48:50,782 --> 01:48:56,343
[SPEAKER_04]: If this is something you're interested in, you might want to quote, encourage your friends to buy the Steam version, or buy it for them.

1485
01:48:57,264 --> 01:48:59,604
[SPEAKER_04]: P.S., the game's 40% off on Steam right now.

1486
01:48:59,885 --> 01:49:03,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, that wasn't in the quote, but that sure seemed to be convenient.

1487
01:49:03,706 --> 01:49:05,506
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yep, you want Half Minute Hero 2?

1488
01:49:06,367 --> 01:49:07,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Buy Part 1 for friends.

1489
01:49:08,767 --> 01:49:09,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Half Minute Hero was kind of fun.

1490
01:49:11,843 --> 01:49:17,071
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm not going to cry if the sequel never comes out, but I'm surprised it didn't sell enough to necessitate the sequel.

1491
01:49:17,812 --> 01:49:18,333
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

1492
01:49:19,274 --> 01:49:19,875
[SPEAKER_10]: Stuff happened.

1493
01:49:19,915 --> 01:49:20,156
[SPEAKER_10]: The end.

1494
01:49:20,176 --> 01:49:20,676
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm kidding.

1495
01:49:21,918 --> 01:49:23,541
[SPEAKER_10]: For fans of the...

1496
01:49:26,781 --> 01:49:42,948
[SPEAKER_10]: of the AM2 games they are going to be out on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network during the week we have Fighting Vipers Sonic the Fighters which I'm more excited about and Virtua Fighter 2 which I could give less than a crap about but I'm usually very alone in that

1497
01:49:44,429 --> 01:49:48,451
[SPEAKER_10]: The games are going to have their own achievements and trophies and will support online multiplayer.

1498
01:49:49,071 --> 01:49:59,697
[SPEAKER_10]: They will be about five bucks each and about 4.49 euro in Europe.

1499
01:49:59,877 --> 01:50:04,860
[SPEAKER_10]: So they'll be out on November 27th in North America and December 5th in Europe.

1500
01:50:07,003 --> 01:50:10,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Man, I have Fighter's Megamix at home.

1501
01:50:11,067 --> 01:50:15,831
[SPEAKER_10]: And I wish that they would update Fighter's Megamix.

1502
01:50:15,851 --> 01:50:16,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Wouldn't that be awesome?

1503
01:50:17,652 --> 01:50:22,236
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyway, Capcom's also getting back into more fighting game stuff.

1504
01:50:22,296 --> 01:50:25,599
[SPEAKER_10]: They've registered the name Fighters of Capcom.

1505
01:50:25,719 --> 01:50:26,820
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a trademark, actually.

1506
01:50:27,661 --> 01:50:31,985
[SPEAKER_10]: And they haven't really said what it's about, but...

1507
01:50:33,524 --> 01:50:34,424
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it'll be good.

1508
01:50:35,245 --> 01:50:35,665
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully.

1509
01:50:36,845 --> 01:50:47,210
[SPEAKER_10]: And moving forward, on the Korean ratings board, Resident Evil Revelations has been listed for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

1510
01:50:47,910 --> 01:50:52,592
[SPEAKER_10]: So that means we might actually be getting the version out for the bigger consoles.

1511
01:50:52,892 --> 01:50:53,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

1512
01:50:54,373 --> 01:50:54,973
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is that.

1513
01:50:56,153 --> 01:50:56,453
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1514
01:50:56,934 --> 01:50:59,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's take a trip over to Facebook and Google+.

1515
01:50:59,995 --> 01:51:02,436
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you slam those words together, you get Boogle.

1516
01:51:09,966 --> 01:51:11,067
[SPEAKER_04]: The Google Question of the Week.

1517
01:51:11,107 --> 01:51:15,210
[SPEAKER_04]: We ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities and look for some answers.

1518
01:51:15,891 --> 01:51:19,974
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, it's got to be about the Wii U again this week, but with good reason.

1519
01:51:20,835 --> 01:51:28,661
[SPEAKER_04]: This is about kind of how we're feeling post-launch of the Wii U. Here's the question from our Facebook community at Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio and our Google Plus community.

1520
01:51:28,681 --> 01:51:29,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Search for Orange Launch Radio.

1521
01:51:30,482 --> 01:51:38,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that the console has been out for a week, have you found that your opinion has changed on the Wii U from the pre-release hype?

1522
01:51:38,786 --> 01:51:42,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps you weren't so excited about it before, but you ended up buying one for a reason.

1523
01:51:43,308 --> 01:51:47,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you were really excited after E3, but found that maybe it'll hold off for a while.

1524
01:51:47,470 --> 01:51:49,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did or didn't your opinion change?

1525
01:51:50,491 --> 01:51:52,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to some comments first off from Facebook.

1526
01:51:53,706 --> 01:51:54,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Wicked said, Wow, I was wrong.

1527
01:52:14,554 --> 01:52:19,976
[SPEAKER_04]: The graphics are definitely top notch and the Wii's usual stigma of waggle wand was significantly downplayed.

1528
01:52:20,336 --> 01:52:25,298
[SPEAKER_04]: The games are amazing, especially Zombie U and Nintendo Land which could easily be the party game of the year.

1529
01:52:25,778 --> 01:52:34,021
[SPEAKER_04]: As lukewarm as I was for the Wii U, I must say after having it in my hands, which the tablet controller feels perfectly fine in, I am definitely on the bandwagon now.

1530
01:52:35,301 --> 01:52:40,126
[SPEAKER_04]: VirtualPhil said I was excited for it but also a bit meh regarding the annoying hype.

1531
01:52:40,547 --> 01:52:46,713
[SPEAKER_04]: However, now that I've played the console and have had a ton of fun with Nintendo Land's multiplayer games, I'm loving it.

1532
01:52:47,093 --> 01:52:49,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wish the catalog of games was bigger from the outset.

1533
01:52:50,456 --> 01:52:51,337
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkCharger said,

1534
01:53:11,747 --> 01:53:16,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Doug T said, I'm holding off on buying the Wii U. I'm waiting for more high-quality first-party games.

1535
01:53:17,110 --> 01:53:22,773
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a PS3, which is my favorite console, so when games are released on all three consoles, I'll buy it for my PS3.

1536
01:53:23,313 --> 01:53:27,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I was disappointed with my Wii, so I'm waiting to see how the Wii U does over time.

1537
01:53:28,615 --> 01:53:33,658
[SPEAKER_04]: AZHP said, before the console launched, I was really hopeful that Nintendo had figured out online.

1538
01:53:34,178 --> 01:53:35,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Pause for Loki to scoff.

1539
01:53:37,810 --> 01:53:39,651
[SPEAKER_03]: They figured out that it's there.

1540
01:53:40,911 --> 01:53:41,831
[SPEAKER_03]: How to use it, maybe.

1541
01:53:42,431 --> 01:53:56,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that I'm hearing reports of how purchases are tied to the console instead of the Mii profile, that there are separate wallets for Wii and Wii U online purchases that are on the same console, and that profiles can't be transferred between consoles, I'm just disappointed in Nintendo.

1542
01:53:56,756 --> 01:53:59,916
[SPEAKER_04]: The 360 did online right, and they did it seven years ago.

1543
01:54:00,137 --> 01:54:01,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Shame on Nintendo.

1544
01:54:02,638 --> 01:54:12,225
[SPEAKER_04]: This answer is a little lengthy from Degenerate Johnny, so I'm not going to read the whole thing, but basically said, you know, when Reggie said that they're going to cater to hardcore gamers, he was very excited.

1545
01:54:12,606 --> 01:54:19,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that it's launched, my anticipation dropped considerably, partially because the console lacks focus on achievement and trophy system.

1546
01:54:21,007 --> 01:54:23,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo did this for the benefit of the developers.

1547
01:54:24,048 --> 01:54:28,770
[SPEAKER_04]: And he kind of goes on to talk about how it's like a standard thing now, how Blizzard and all this does this.

1548
01:54:29,731 --> 01:54:38,275
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of disappointed they missed the boat on that too, especially because, you know, on the 3DS, they have the whole accomplishments thing in the plaza.

1549
01:54:38,415 --> 01:54:40,355
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought they were going this direction.

1550
01:54:40,916 --> 01:54:42,296
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's... Oops.

1551
01:54:43,917 --> 01:54:45,298
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not ready for the mailbag yet.

1552
01:54:45,338 --> 01:54:46,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Be quiet, music.

1553
01:54:47,639 --> 01:54:48,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.

1554
01:54:48,799 --> 01:54:49,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Live radio, it's fun.

1555
01:54:52,310 --> 01:54:56,293
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I don't think it's a deal breaker for the system.

1556
01:54:56,353 --> 01:55:00,196
[SPEAKER_04]: It's disappointing, but what do you want to bet it's one of those things that just suddenly shows up later?

1557
01:55:01,937 --> 01:55:02,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1558
01:55:05,347 --> 01:55:15,553
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at some of the comments in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com BlackWolf said, to be fair, Nintendo said that you'll be able to transfer profiles yourself soon and that they can already transfer them if you call them.

1559
01:55:15,974 --> 01:55:21,857
[SPEAKER_04]: But yes, it's not there on launch day because obviously we all bought multiple Wii U's and really want to be able to transfer our profiles in the first week.

1560
01:55:22,718 --> 01:55:28,441
[SPEAKER_04]: BlackWolf, again, it's the whole they're building it as they go along and how obvious is it?

1561
01:55:28,782 --> 01:55:29,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

1562
01:55:36,181 --> 01:55:46,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Pete Garuno says, I was cautiously optimistic when it was announced, indifferent when more details emerged, but then I tried a demo unit and could see the potential.

1563
01:55:46,968 --> 01:55:55,493
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my friends bought it on launch, and seeing the social aspects of sending picture messages, asking other players for help on a specific point is kind of selling it for me.

1564
01:55:56,033 --> 01:56:01,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't really justify the purchase at the moment though, so it's currently on my wait for a major price reduction pile.

1565
01:56:03,336 --> 01:56:09,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, going to Codeman, I haven't bought one yet, but I've played with one here and they're at different electronic stores.

1566
01:56:09,439 --> 01:56:13,641
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to say that the tech is pretty cool and being a designer, the interface is well done as well.

1567
01:56:14,141 --> 01:56:19,844
[SPEAKER_04]: What's keeping me from buying it though is I don't believe Nintendo is done with it and tried to rush it out before the holiday season.

1568
01:56:20,264 --> 01:56:23,966
[SPEAKER_04]: So until everything is working correctly, I would love to get my hands on one.

1569
01:56:25,026 --> 01:56:28,230
[SPEAKER_04]: The only flaw in your logic I see is that, again, it's about the games.

1570
01:56:29,151 --> 01:56:34,036
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not necessarily about the hardware or even the firmware that's on said hardware.

1571
01:56:34,136 --> 01:56:41,425
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if they're writing that as they go along, it's weird, but it's not really a deal breaker if Mario HD is still going to be Mario HD at the end of the day.

1572
01:56:41,805 --> 01:56:42,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about that.

1573
01:56:42,366 --> 01:56:42,946
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm saying.

1574
01:56:44,147 --> 01:56:53,394
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can see what he's saying, though, because if you look at the Wii, remember the Wii came out, and then they're all, oh, Motion Plus, because, you know, we really wanted these controllers more sensitive.

1575
01:56:53,735 --> 01:56:56,217
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we have Wii Motion Plus, and oh, you bought Motion Plus?

1576
01:56:56,657 --> 01:56:57,057
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1577
01:56:57,117 --> 01:57:00,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we have this fancy controller that already has it incorporated into it.

1578
01:57:00,260 --> 01:57:01,000
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

1579
01:57:01,361 --> 01:57:07,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait, now we need this other controller to do something, and you need that for this game, and...

1580
01:57:08,346 --> 01:57:08,946
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fair.

1581
01:57:09,166 --> 01:57:09,566
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fair.

1582
01:57:09,986 --> 01:57:10,667
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that.

1583
01:57:10,707 --> 01:57:13,067
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole Wii Motion Plus or the Vitality Sensor.

1584
01:57:13,167 --> 01:57:13,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh.

1585
01:57:14,407 --> 01:57:14,687
[SPEAKER_04]: LOL.

1586
01:57:15,247 --> 01:57:16,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Google Plus time.

1587
01:57:16,988 --> 01:57:19,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Evil says, Hype level has generally been the same.

1588
01:57:20,168 --> 01:57:22,629
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, it's E3VL, but it says evil to me.

1589
01:57:23,129 --> 01:57:24,829
[SPEAKER_04]: Hype level has been generally the same.

1590
01:57:25,610 --> 01:57:28,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo's consoles will always be my go-to for first-party content.

1591
01:57:28,670 --> 01:57:36,732
[SPEAKER_04]: My only concern is that if the Wii U will be my main console after Microsoft and Sony releases their next system, seeing if Nintendo is consistent with quality of third-party ports.

1592
01:57:37,632 --> 01:57:39,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Redertainment says, My opinion has not changed.

1593
01:57:39,833 --> 01:57:45,494
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have priorities that are higher on my list than buying a Wii U. It's not that I think a Wii U would be a good buy or a bad buy.

1594
01:57:45,835 --> 01:57:47,555
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd just rather save for a house right now.

1595
01:57:47,895 --> 01:57:49,316
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I'm alone in this opinion.

1596
01:57:49,936 --> 01:57:50,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Priorities are important.

1597
01:57:50,956 --> 01:57:51,396
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you that.

1598
01:57:52,317 --> 01:57:56,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Rabababa says, Now that I've played it a few days, the pad is better than expected.

1599
01:57:56,958 --> 01:57:58,258
[SPEAKER_04]: It can do a lot of unique things.

1600
01:57:58,398 --> 01:58:01,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Best of all, I can look up hints on the internet without an extra device.

1601
01:58:01,659 --> 01:58:03,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Very few games take advantage of it.

1602
01:58:04,059 --> 01:58:08,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Flaco Jones says, I got a chance to play it for a few hours and my opinion hasn't changed much.

1603
01:58:08,620 --> 01:58:15,722
[SPEAKER_04]: I still think it's way overpriced when comparing it to the competition and the controller didn't sway me with the small selection of games that utilize it halfway decently.

1604
01:58:16,222 --> 01:58:18,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Better games would definitely be the best way to change my mind.

1605
01:58:19,823 --> 01:58:22,443
[SPEAKER_04]: Sean F replied and said, I was never really excited.

1606
01:58:22,703 --> 01:58:24,424
[SPEAKER_04]: My PS3 and PSP are enough for me.

1607
01:58:25,164 --> 01:58:31,405
[SPEAKER_04]: And Nick M said, yeah, it went from being a polished, well-presented turd to just a turd that sits in the corner of my living room.

1608
01:58:32,146 --> 01:58:32,906
[SPEAKER_04]: So you bought one?

1609
01:58:33,886 --> 01:58:38,468
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be curious to hear more about you bought one and it's sitting in your living room unused.

1610
01:58:38,608 --> 01:58:40,329
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to hear more about that.

1611
01:58:41,109 --> 01:58:42,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Please elaborate for later.

1612
01:58:43,130 --> 01:58:45,111
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to hear about your collection of polished turds.

1613
01:58:45,131 --> 01:58:45,551
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm kidding.

1614
01:58:46,812 --> 01:58:50,814
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't heard of anybody who's bought one that said, yeah, it's already collecting dust in the corner.

1615
01:58:52,595 --> 01:58:55,657
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very curious to explore that further, so please send an email or something.

1616
01:58:55,957 --> 01:59:00,301
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very possible it collected fingerprints, because I'm sure it can collect fingerprints quite well.

1617
01:59:00,481 --> 01:59:02,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it does.

1618
01:59:02,142 --> 01:59:02,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially the black ones.

1619
01:59:03,263 --> 01:59:05,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I read all the comments tonight, because I'm nice.

1620
01:59:06,845 --> 01:59:10,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Code Band is in chat, by the way, to kind of clarify the comment.

1621
01:59:10,666 --> 01:59:17,468
[SPEAKER_04]: I really want to check out Zombie U. And I do agree it's about the games, Rob, but I do think they should get the console under control before a good title can be released.

1622
01:59:17,948 --> 01:59:21,309
[SPEAKER_04]: In light of what Loki said, I get a little more what you're saying now.

1623
01:59:22,050 --> 01:59:22,290
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1624
01:59:22,310 --> 01:59:25,671
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple of stories for you guys, and then we're going to get to the match game.

1625
01:59:25,711 --> 01:59:26,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

1626
01:59:27,574 --> 01:59:27,874
[SPEAKER_03]: THQ PR Guys

1627
01:59:46,895 --> 01:59:52,317
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been trying to cover up, well, cover up, I guess, defuse a situation that happened on Twitter.

1628
01:59:53,697 --> 01:59:54,537
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was on Twitter.

1629
01:59:55,137 --> 01:59:56,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, during an interview.

1630
01:59:56,578 --> 01:59:58,118
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always Twitter.

1631
01:59:58,538 --> 02:00:00,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Take away people's PR, people.

1632
02:00:01,499 --> 02:00:02,919
[SPEAKER_04]: And, like, they say the dumbest shit.

1633
02:00:02,979 --> 02:00:04,300
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why Twitter is great.

1634
02:00:05,160 --> 02:00:05,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly.

1635
02:00:06,481 --> 02:00:08,682
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think at least part of it took place on Twitter.

1636
02:00:08,842 --> 02:00:13,705
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically talking about how the Wii U's CPU is slow.

1637
02:00:14,625 --> 02:00:18,647
[SPEAKER_03]: And the quote is actually, the Wii U has a horrible, slow CPU.

1638
02:00:19,167 --> 02:00:29,513
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why they're saying that Metro Last Light is not going to be ported to the Wii U is because the game system has a slow CPU and that it would just be impossible.

1639
02:00:30,633 --> 02:00:30,893
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

1640
02:00:32,478 --> 02:00:45,261
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, THQ doesn't want to have this whole stigma of, oh, yeah, we just totally dogged in that system, but we want to put some games out on it and have Nintendo go, yeah, fuck you guys.

1641
02:00:46,082 --> 02:00:47,262
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going on our system.

1642
02:00:48,262 --> 02:00:53,324
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you think about it, THQ doesn't have a whole ton of... I mean, they have a few games, I guess, that were launched.

1643
02:00:53,344 --> 02:00:56,604
[SPEAKER_03]: There was Darksiders 2 and...

1644
02:00:59,205 --> 02:01:12,721
[SPEAKER_03]: they it's not out yet but they've got Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy that they're porting over to that not necessarily CPU intensive games I mean Darksiders maybe a little bit but you know Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune not quite so much um

1645
02:01:14,222 --> 02:01:29,830
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know, it's interesting though, they have basically the developer saying one thing and then THQ's kind of like saying, oh, well, it's not necessarily what they meant, they're just saying that, oh, it's a very CPU intensive game and, you know, that...

1646
02:01:31,070 --> 02:01:35,833
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, maybe that this, you know, Wii U CPU wouldn't be able to handle this or something.

1647
02:01:36,233 --> 02:01:49,600
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's some other developers saying, well, you know, sounds like, you know, they just couldn't even bother, you know, trying to port the game system, you know, port over because it does have a faster GPU and a lot more RAM than the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360.

1648
02:01:50,801 --> 02:01:54,643
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, you know, it's this Gustav Holling thing.

1649
02:01:55,043 --> 02:01:57,545
[SPEAKER_03]: saying, oh, yeah, you know, GPU and RAM's nice.

1650
02:01:57,605 --> 02:02:00,466
[SPEAKER_03]: I have shaders and textures loaded, but physics and gameplay run CPU.

1651
02:02:00,486 --> 02:02:01,507
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

1652
02:02:02,127 --> 02:02:03,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Will that be a problem?

1653
02:02:03,829 --> 02:02:04,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Possibly.

1654
02:02:04,709 --> 02:02:05,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1655
02:02:05,069 --> 02:02:15,636
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be interesting to see if we get, you know, if Grand Theft Auto V doesn't come to the Wii U because it's got a slow CPU and can't load, you know, can't load the world fast enough or something like that.

1656
02:02:16,451 --> 02:02:23,895
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw with a fair thought in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Maybe the Wii U having a better GPU and a slow CPU is a trade-off.

1657
02:02:24,275 --> 02:02:33,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo wanted a system with really great graphics, but had to sacrifice CPU in order to bring the cost of the system down, which is why some games like Arkham City have frame rate drops.

1658
02:02:34,941 --> 02:02:36,401
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not good.

1659
02:02:36,782 --> 02:02:41,024
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I understand that if you're going to make sacrifices, then you're not ready.

1660
02:02:41,324 --> 02:02:45,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you need to wait until that tech comes down in price.

1661
02:02:45,966 --> 02:02:47,887
[SPEAKER_03]: and maybe one of the consoles will be more finished.

1662
02:02:48,367 --> 02:02:56,049
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's going to be a problem because if you're not willing to put the technology into it, you're going to have these next-gen systems come out and they're just going to run circles around you.

1663
02:02:56,449 --> 02:03:02,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and the frame rate drop in Arkham City, I'm chalking that up to the fact that it's a port of a game that wasn't designed for the console.

1664
02:03:03,351 --> 02:03:05,992
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really curious what 2013's games are going to look like.

1665
02:03:06,052 --> 02:03:08,233
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really what's going to define the Wii U, honestly.

1666
02:03:08,433 --> 02:03:10,114
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure the first party games will look nice.

1667
02:03:10,154 --> 02:03:12,055
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they've always kind of based their sales off of.

1668
02:03:12,075 --> 02:03:13,396
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what always happens for Nintendo.

1669
02:03:13,636 --> 02:03:24,063
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, that'll look nice because they're developing for the system, but you're going to have to wonder with some of these game systems that are already out there now, and you're going to have a Wii U version coming out at the same time.

1670
02:03:24,663 --> 02:03:33,969
[SPEAKER_03]: and honestly, for me, it seems like it's like, okay, Nintendo told these publishers, hey, by the way, you gotta have this gimmick that's thrown in there.

1671
02:03:34,009 --> 02:03:42,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, for example, NBA 2K13, you can hold up the Wii U's gamepad to see which of your athletes or whatever are tired.

1672
02:03:44,395 --> 02:03:45,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1673
02:04:03,766 --> 02:04:04,887
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1674
02:04:27,848 --> 02:04:28,589
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1675
02:04:50,628 --> 02:05:17,151
[SPEAKER_04]: going to our chat room with some comments at live.vognetwork.com Ranma says I'm waiting for Mario Kart and Bayonetta 2 and Dungeon Buster says I'm mostly waiting on Bayonetta 2 Ranma says by the way I feel bad for people eBaying Wii U's it's pointless don't feel bad for them point and laugh at them I think it's hilarious that that whole scheme is backfiring because those people that are buying consoles just to flip them and take them away from somebody who might really want them fuck them I hope they lose a lot of money

1676
02:05:18,672 --> 02:05:46,829
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they get stuck with all those Twinkies too and have to eat them so you know what I feel no sympathy for them unless it was like legitimately bought and maybe being flipped around because a person decided well I don't want this polished turd sitting in the corner of my room anymore that's different like a used Wii U already or whatever but like somebody who bought it just to try and flip it for an increased cost middle finger to you I don't care that you're out $400 they'll take them back to the store and get their money back which is also bullshit but you know it is what it is

1677
02:05:47,972 --> 02:06:15,579
[SPEAKER_04]: anyhow uh piggybacking on this a little bit there's a piece in the New York Times that is kind of a like it's in the New York Times it's not really an opinion article but it certainly kind of kind of looks at is did Nintendo do the right thing is the Wii U a good system and they go to a familiar name for a quote which you know this little quote from the New York Times article is making its way around the game blogs and the quote is from Nolan Bushnell you recognize that name yep yeah what did he do Jamie

1678
02:06:17,026 --> 02:06:18,128
[SPEAKER_09]: and Chuck E. Cheese.

1679
02:06:18,688 --> 02:06:20,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and Pond too.

1680
02:06:20,691 --> 02:06:21,391
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and Chuck E. Cheese.

1681
02:06:21,411 --> 02:06:22,092
[SPEAKER_04]: That's important too.

1682
02:06:22,613 --> 02:06:27,539
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, quote, I actually am baffled by it.

1683
02:06:28,300 --> 02:06:29,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's going to be a big success.

1684
02:06:31,857 --> 02:06:32,478
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the quote.

1685
02:06:32,898 --> 02:06:33,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1686
02:06:33,819 --> 02:06:34,680
[SPEAKER_04]: What else did he say here?

1687
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:40,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Quote, these things will continue to sputter along, but I really don't think they'll be of major import ever again.

1688
02:06:40,767 --> 02:06:42,689
[SPEAKER_04]: It feels like the end of an era to me.

1689
02:06:42,709 --> 02:06:48,214
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, that has all the game blogs going, Nolan Bushnell thinks the Wii U is the end of an era, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1690
02:06:49,315 --> 02:07:14,232
[SPEAKER_04]: and the the it's important to note that this article also kind of takes the stance of uh that mobile it's it's another one of those pieces that say mobile gaming is going to kill it all and and you know Nintendo's just trying to get into tablet gaming with this and so I don't know how I feel about all this but it is interesting that Nolan Bushnell kind of throws his two cents out there granted it's one small quote out of what I hope was a larger interview but um

1691
02:07:15,072 --> 02:07:16,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it the end of an era?

1692
02:07:17,074 --> 02:07:20,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the Wii U the swan song of console gaming as we know it?

1693
02:07:21,497 --> 02:07:22,417
[SPEAKER_04]: I hardly think so.

1694
02:07:24,038 --> 02:07:25,239
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just stupid.

1695
02:07:26,140 --> 02:07:33,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, you're kind of assuming that everyone's going to buy into it or not going to buy into it and go, Oh no, what am I going to game on now?

1696
02:07:34,306 --> 02:07:39,229
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't understand why everyone thinks if these next-gen consoles fail that the whole industry is going to fail.

1697
02:07:39,529 --> 02:07:41,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, you have some consoles that still work.

1698
02:07:41,471 --> 02:07:43,152
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what happens if a console fails?

1699
02:07:43,692 --> 02:07:43,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what?

1700
02:07:44,013 --> 02:07:45,755
[SPEAKER_03]: They just make games for other consoles.

1701
02:07:46,075 --> 02:07:46,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like the Vita.

1702
02:07:46,917 --> 02:07:48,519
[SPEAKER_03]: If the Vita fails, guess what?

1703
02:07:48,539 --> 02:07:50,642
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll just make games for the 3DS and the DS.

1704
02:07:51,628 --> 02:07:59,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Wolf kind of puts Nolan's words in another light here, saying, no more TV gaming, all going handheld mobile now.

1705
02:07:59,753 --> 02:08:00,993
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what Nolan thinks.

1706
02:08:01,414 --> 02:08:04,395
[SPEAKER_04]: More people play mobile games than ever played console games.

1707
02:08:04,755 --> 02:08:13,200
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe he's thinking, maybe Nolan is going this way because of the Wii U invoking the tablet thing, kind of trying to get that piece of mobile game.

1708
02:08:13,240 --> 02:08:14,081
[SPEAKER_04]: But for me, like...

1709
02:08:15,061 --> 02:08:22,108
[SPEAKER_04]: The part that people miss when they jump to that conclusion is that they're not putting I mean, the Wii U kind of can't do those same tablet games.

1710
02:08:22,228 --> 02:08:26,032
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is a second screen that does have limited touch controls.

1711
02:08:26,132 --> 02:08:27,613
[SPEAKER_10]: It just means you can play while you pee.

1712
02:08:29,775 --> 02:08:31,797
[SPEAKER_04]: I guarantee there's going to be DS Virtual Console games by next year.

1713
02:08:59,745 --> 02:09:23,228
[SPEAKER_04]: oh oh with the whole yeah because since there is second screen anyway and why not screen is set up exactly like a ds why not i think clearly it all indicates a return to animatronic restaurants uh blackwell following up saying well what he's saying is that the new console isn't selling out so people have stopped buying new game consoles i think it is actually selling now it's just they're replenishing a lot faster

1714
02:09:23,328 --> 02:09:46,516
[SPEAKER_04]: and Nintendo's also not advertising it because maybe you know and there's a lot of theories behind that but you know maybe to their benefit they know they're going to be limited so why I mean the people that want to buy them already know about it so why have that advertising push behind it let that grow a little more organically and then do the big advertising push in January February when when you need it spend your gift card on a Wii U you know that that stuff

1715
02:09:50,215 --> 02:09:54,037
[SPEAKER_04]: BlackWolf continuing on trying to push the points here.

1716
02:09:54,718 --> 02:09:59,261
[SPEAKER_04]: But Cut the Rope and Angry Birds are the games that majority of game buyers want to play.

1717
02:09:59,661 --> 02:10:00,862
[SPEAKER_04]: We're the minority now.

1718
02:10:03,864 --> 02:10:12,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes and no to me because I feel like the majority audience that's buying Cut the Rope and Angry Birds is an audience that didn't exist before.

1719
02:10:13,531 --> 02:10:18,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Did people really switch from console gaming to exclusive mobile gaming?

1720
02:10:19,110 --> 02:10:20,933
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really think that's what happened

1721
02:10:35,976 --> 02:10:47,805
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I can understand that, okay, that's where a lot of money is at and so forth, but the console industry has been afloat for the years since 1978 with, say, the video game crash of 83, 84.

1722
02:10:49,046 --> 02:10:51,208
[SPEAKER_04]: The video game industry has been afloat without that audience.

1723
02:10:52,825 --> 02:10:53,806
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know.

1724
02:10:54,587 --> 02:10:54,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

1725
02:10:55,588 --> 02:10:55,849
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1726
02:10:56,569 --> 02:10:57,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on.

1727
02:10:59,253 --> 02:11:02,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Bojikawa wants to say, I keep hearing that the Wii U hasn't been advertised.

1728
02:11:03,037 --> 02:11:05,159
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't watch TV, but I do watch Hulu.

1729
02:11:05,480 --> 02:11:08,583
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen the commercial for the Wii U many times there the last couple weeks.

1730
02:11:09,444 --> 02:11:12,707
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also your audience that's most likely to be aware of things like that.

1731
02:11:12,967 --> 02:11:15,108
[SPEAKER_04]: That's still targeting your tech crowd.

1732
02:11:15,749 --> 02:11:19,852
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a big difference between running Wii U commercials there and running Wii U commercials on Saturday morning cartoons.

1733
02:11:20,432 --> 02:11:21,713
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, I digress.

1734
02:11:22,534 --> 02:11:23,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's play some Match Game.

1735
02:11:24,035 --> 02:11:25,096
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to do Match Game.

1736
02:11:26,317 --> 02:11:28,198
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't done Match Game in forever on this show.

1737
02:11:31,540 --> 02:11:31,821
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1738
02:11:32,401 --> 02:11:36,044
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to play Match Game in our chat room...

1739
02:11:36,949 --> 02:11:37,690
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1740
02:12:03,228 --> 02:12:03,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

1741

[SPEAKER_04]: Also joining us for the Match Game tonight is Tech Master Loki.

1742
02:12:07,910 --> 02:12:08,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

1743
02:12:09,070 --> 02:12:11,291
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to be joining you for the Match Game tonight.

1744
02:12:11,331 --> 02:12:11,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo-hoo.

1745
02:12:12,731 --> 02:12:17,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Also joining us for the Match Game tonight, say hello to, it's your first time on the show, be gentle, Rachel.

1746
02:12:18,053 --> 02:12:18,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Howdy.

1747
02:12:18,693 --> 02:12:19,173
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

1748
02:12:20,134 --> 02:12:21,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you here to promote anything tonight?

1749
02:12:21,734 --> 02:12:23,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a new movie coming out that you need to promote?

1750
02:12:24,715 --> 02:12:25,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a book?

1751
02:12:25,836 --> 02:12:26,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Quick blog plug.

1752
02:12:27,196 --> 02:12:27,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sure.

1753
02:12:28,536 --> 02:12:30,457
[SPEAKER_12]: Greetings at the Wasteland at WordPress.

1754
02:12:31,017 --> 02:12:31,577
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1755
02:12:31,737 --> 02:12:32,897
[SPEAKER_12]: Greetings from the Wasteland.

1756
02:12:33,177 --> 02:12:33,717
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

1757
02:12:34,197 --> 02:12:35,237
[SPEAKER_04]: But it doesn't stop there.

1758
02:12:35,277 --> 02:12:39,198
[SPEAKER_04]: We have one more person playing match game with us tonight.

1759
02:12:39,538 --> 02:12:41,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello, everybody, to Alan.

1760
02:12:41,739 --> 02:12:43,119
[SPEAKER_05]: Raspberries.

1761
02:12:44,359 --> 02:12:45,159
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing, Alan?

1762
02:12:45,959 --> 02:12:46,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

1763
02:12:46,679 --> 02:12:50,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything... Are you doing your Carol Channing for us tonight?

1764
02:12:50,240 --> 02:12:52,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what you're going to do match game as?

1765
02:12:52,940 --> 02:12:54,381
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm fine.

1766
02:12:54,441 --> 02:12:55,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have anything you want to promote tonight?

1767
02:12:58,530 --> 02:13:00,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to promote Fabulous Flame?

1768
02:13:00,451 --> 02:13:01,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm really sorry about that.

1769
02:13:02,813 --> 02:13:04,874
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to promote new internet.

1770
02:13:05,495 --> 02:13:06,736
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not dropping out.

1771
02:13:07,396 --> 02:13:08,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, apparently it's doing pretty well.

1772
02:13:08,877 --> 02:13:10,038
[SPEAKER_04]: So, hooray to that.

1773
02:13:10,418 --> 02:13:12,540
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we're going to open up the Skype line.

1774
02:13:12,920 --> 02:13:15,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, we're going to have one contestant in the chat room, one on the Skype line.

1775
02:13:16,302 --> 02:13:19,424
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to play a match game, call us on the Skype line right now.

1776

02:13:22,346 --> 02:13:24,628
[SPEAKER_04]: or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1778
02:13:24,668 --> 02:13:27,370
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to pick one person on the phones and another from our chat room.

1779
02:13:28,190 --> 02:13:30,352
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like we have a few correct answers right now.

1780
02:13:30,872 --> 02:13:32,433
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

1781
02:13:32,473 --> 02:13:35,195
[SPEAKER_04]: Use name in Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

1782
02:13:35,616 --> 02:13:41,940
[SPEAKER_04]: While we wait for that call, because there is a little bit of a delay still, and I think the delay got longer because of our setup, but that's okay.

1783
02:13:41,980 --> 02:13:44,502
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather it be a longer delay and not drop out as much.

1784
02:13:46,503 --> 02:13:49,806
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyhow, what I want to... Oh, we got a call coming in.

1785
02:13:49,966 --> 02:13:50,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's...

1786
02:13:51,437 --> 02:13:51,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

1787
02:13:53,337 --> 02:13:54,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

1788
02:13:54,338 --> 02:13:54,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

1789
02:13:55,698 --> 02:13:57,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, this is SSJ100 Matt.

1790
02:13:57,218 --> 02:13:58,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, SSJ100 Matt.

1791
02:13:58,478 --> 02:13:59,078
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

1792
02:13:59,198 --> 02:13:59,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

1793
02:13:59,938 --> 02:14:00,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good.

1794
02:14:00,719 --> 02:14:02,339
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I haven't heard from you in a while.

1795
02:14:02,719 --> 02:14:04,159
[SPEAKER_04]: You did all right through Sandy and all that?

1796
02:14:05,319 --> 02:14:05,959
[SPEAKER_07]: I did, actually.

1797
02:14:06,160 --> 02:14:06,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Good, good.

1798
02:14:06,660 --> 02:14:07,280
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad to hear it.

1799
02:14:07,520 --> 02:14:09,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, are you ready to play some match game with us tonight?

1800
02:14:10,240 --> 02:14:10,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Hells yeah.

1801
02:14:10,920 --> 02:14:11,880
[SPEAKER_04]: Hells yeah.

1802
02:14:12,261 --> 02:14:12,501
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1803
02:14:12,541 --> 02:14:16,021
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like we have only four people in chat that want to play along.

1804
02:14:16,101 --> 02:14:17,541
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's see.

1805
02:14:18,162 --> 02:14:20,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan, since you can't see chat, pick a number between one and four.

1806
02:14:21,903 --> 02:14:22,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft

1807
02:14:38,524 --> 02:14:39,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft vs. SSJ100Map

1808
02:14:55,703 --> 02:14:56,423
[SPEAKER_04]: You get a point.

1809
02:14:56,723 --> 02:14:59,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep in mind, Actdeft is playing against you in the chat room.

1810
02:14:59,444 --> 02:15:03,666
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll be sending his answers over private message and you will be giving yours over the phone.

1811
02:15:03,706 --> 02:15:09,228
[SPEAKER_04]: But remember, please do not give your answers until we have a ding from everybody here in the studio.

1812
02:15:09,868 --> 02:15:11,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, do you understand the rules, SSJ100 Matt?

1813
02:15:12,649 --> 02:15:12,949
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.

1814
02:15:13,109 --> 02:15:14,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's because you've played before.

1815
02:15:14,871 --> 02:15:15,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, yes Alan.

1816
02:15:16,072 --> 02:15:22,356
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to add that we're all really bad at this because I remember the last time we played this and not a single one of us matched shit with anyone.

1817
02:15:23,137 --> 02:15:24,238
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the joke.

1818
02:15:26,059 --> 02:15:26,860
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not.

1819
02:15:27,941 --> 02:15:28,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here we go.

1820
02:15:30,002 --> 02:15:33,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into tonight's first question.

1821
02:15:33,705 --> 02:15:34,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Drumroll please.

1822
02:15:34,986 --> 02:15:35,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

1823
02:15:35,546 --> 02:15:36,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight's first question.

1824
02:15:36,407 --> 02:15:37,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Four questions tonight.

1825
02:15:39,361 --> 02:15:47,088
[SPEAKER_04]: As Space Harrier's biggest fan, Jamie is very excited about Space Harrier coming to the 3DS.

1826
02:15:48,189 --> 02:16:01,502
[SPEAKER_04]: She found it odd, though, that in her honor, the designers changed the opening line from Welcome to the Fantasy Zone, get ready, to Welcome to the blank, get ready.

1827
02:16:08,977 --> 02:16:13,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Space Harrier's biggest fan, Jamie, is very excited about Space Harrier coming to the 3DS.

1828
02:16:13,520 --> 02:16:24,508
[SPEAKER_04]: She found it odd, though, that in her honor, the designers changed the opening line from Welcome to the Fantasy Zone, get ready, to Welcome to the... What the fuck was that?

1829
02:16:24,588 --> 02:16:27,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the blank, get ready.

1830
02:16:27,450 --> 02:16:28,931
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, you've been beeped.

1831
02:16:30,192 --> 02:16:34,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently I got censored by this crappy Think Music MP3, so we'll pause that.

1832
02:16:34,856 --> 02:16:37,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so I'm going to say...

1833
02:16:39,022 --> 02:16:39,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding.

1834
02:16:39,403 --> 02:16:39,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding.

1835
02:16:39,804 --> 02:16:40,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding.

1836
02:16:40,325 --> 02:16:41,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding, Alan.

1837
02:16:41,227 --> 02:16:41,448
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding.

1838
02:16:42,169 --> 02:16:42,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding.

1839
02:16:42,610 --> 02:16:43,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so we have five.

1840
02:16:44,014 --> 02:16:45,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I see the answer in chat.

1841
02:16:46,139 --> 02:16:48,083
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Matt, do you have an answer?

1842
02:16:48,123 --> 02:16:48,584
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.

1843
02:16:48,605 --> 02:16:49,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the...

1844
02:16:50,814 --> 02:16:51,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to the Citadel

1845
02:17:17,344 --> 02:17:21,333
[SPEAKER_04]: somebody put that down as the quote of the night because I'm fucking clever Rachel

1846
02:17:22,423 --> 02:17:23,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Frenzy from school.

1847
02:17:23,684 --> 02:17:24,725
[SPEAKER_04]: How well do we know Jamie?

1848
02:17:24,825 --> 02:17:25,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the?

1849
02:17:26,266 --> 02:17:29,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Wii U. Welcome to the Wii U. Get ready.

1850
02:17:30,128 --> 02:17:32,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, what was Actdeft's?

1851
02:17:32,670 --> 02:17:33,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm so sorry.

1852
02:17:33,691 --> 02:17:35,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, I'm not ignoring Actdeft.

1853
02:17:35,572 --> 02:17:38,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft said Garrus Zone.

1854
02:17:38,634 --> 02:17:39,474
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a little rusty.

1855
02:17:39,494 --> 02:17:40,235
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm out of practice.

1856
02:17:40,255 --> 02:17:41,216
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't played this in over a year.

1857
02:17:41,576 --> 02:17:43,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the Garrus Zone.

1858
02:17:43,637 --> 02:17:44,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Get ready.

1859
02:17:44,178 --> 02:17:46,479
[SPEAKER_04]: So two Mass Effect answers, but a little different there.

1860
02:17:47,360 --> 02:17:49,161
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have Welcome to the Citadel and Welcome to the Garrus Zone.

1861
02:17:49,441 --> 02:17:51,082
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Loki, welcome to the?

1862
02:17:51,402 --> 02:17:52,143
[SPEAKER_04]: I have Citadel.

1863
02:17:52,583 --> 02:17:53,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you really?

1864
02:17:53,524 --> 02:17:53,925
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.

1865
02:17:54,085 --> 02:17:55,887
[SPEAKER_04]: A point for SSJ100Match.

1866
02:17:56,107 --> 02:17:56,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that, Alan.

1867
02:17:57,329 --> 02:17:58,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that, a point.

1868
02:17:59,371 --> 02:17:59,771
[SPEAKER_03]: I have it.

1869
02:17:59,811 --> 02:18:01,373
[SPEAKER_03]: It's typed on my screen and everything.

1870
02:18:01,553 --> 02:18:02,374
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, there it is.

1871
02:18:03,295 --> 02:18:03,636
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1872
02:18:04,477 --> 02:18:09,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of Alan, who says that these things always end in a 0-0 tie, welcome to the...

1873
02:18:10,302 --> 02:18:11,002
[SPEAKER_05]: Pinkberry.

1874
02:18:11,022 --> 02:18:12,703
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to the Pinkberry.

1875
02:18:12,763 --> 02:18:13,663
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a good answer.

1876
02:18:13,683 --> 02:18:14,663
[SPEAKER_05]: I should have said Pinkberry.

1877
02:18:15,424 --> 02:18:16,284
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a good answer.

1878
02:18:16,324 --> 02:18:17,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the Pinkberry.

1879
02:18:17,284 --> 02:18:17,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Get ready.

1880
02:18:18,084 --> 02:18:22,466
[SPEAKER_04]: And my answer was welcome to the Normandy.

1881
02:18:22,866 --> 02:18:23,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Get ready.

1882
02:18:23,566 --> 02:18:24,927
[SPEAKER_04]: So close.

1883
02:18:24,987 --> 02:18:25,467
[SPEAKER_11]: So close.

1884
02:18:25,527 --> 02:18:26,407
[SPEAKER_04]: So close.

1885
02:18:26,447 --> 02:18:27,047
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what?

1886
02:18:27,107 --> 02:18:29,288
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not taking pity because you already got a point.

1887
02:18:29,768 --> 02:18:30,228
[SPEAKER_04]: So there it is.

1888
02:18:30,448 --> 02:18:32,949
[SPEAKER_04]: The score all in the lead there.

1889
02:18:33,069 --> 02:18:34,550
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100MAT has one point.

1890
02:18:35,110 --> 02:18:36,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft has zero.

1891
02:18:37,791 --> 02:18:38,071
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1892
02:18:38,131 --> 02:18:38,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

1893
02:18:39,773 --> 02:18:40,714
[SPEAKER_04]: On to the next question.

1894
02:18:41,714 --> 02:18:42,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Question number two.

1895
02:18:42,615 --> 02:18:44,636
[SPEAKER_04]: You feeling good about that lead, SSJ100Matt?

1896
02:18:45,337 --> 02:18:46,698
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm feeling great.

1897
02:18:46,878 --> 02:18:47,618
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, feeling great.

1898
02:18:47,658 --> 02:18:49,359
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go to question number two.

1899
02:18:50,941 --> 02:19:05,030
[SPEAKER_04]: THQ might have said that the Wii U has a horrible slow CPU, but Loki is on record saying that the Wii U has a horrible slow blank CPU.

1900
02:19:08,615 --> 02:19:18,461
[SPEAKER_04]: THQ might have said that the Wii U has a horrible slow CPU, but Loki is on record saying that the Wii U has a horrible slow blank.

1901
02:19:18,481 --> 02:19:22,924
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I can make this small enough.

1902
02:19:31,775 --> 02:19:35,598
[SPEAKER_04]: has a horrible slow... I'll do it live!

1903
02:19:37,079 --> 02:19:39,280
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you have to write the answer down.

1904
02:19:39,681 --> 02:19:45,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Or else Alan's going to come over there and say, he rigged it, he rigged it.

1905
02:19:46,826 --> 02:19:48,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan is the Mass Effect po-po, you know.

1906
02:19:49,068 --> 02:19:49,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1907
02:19:50,068 --> 02:19:50,409
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, Alan?

1908
02:19:52,289 --> 02:19:52,589
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1909
02:19:53,270 --> 02:19:53,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here we go.

1910
02:19:53,790 --> 02:19:54,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Does that mean he's C-Sec?

1911
02:19:55,130 --> 02:19:55,750
[SPEAKER_04]: We have an answer.

1912
02:19:56,230 --> 02:19:56,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

1913
02:19:56,770 --> 02:19:58,091
[SPEAKER_04]: We have an answer from Actdeft.

1914
02:19:58,511 --> 02:20:00,091
[SPEAKER_04]: So that means we are ready to go.

1915
02:20:00,291 --> 02:20:02,172
[SPEAKER_04]: SJ100 Matt, you have that answer in your mind?

1916
02:20:02,312 --> 02:20:02,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, I do.

1917
02:20:02,992 --> 02:20:03,632
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, here we go.

1918
02:20:04,112 --> 02:20:10,494
[SPEAKER_04]: THQ might have said that the Wii U has a horrible slow CPU, but Loki is on record saying that the Wii U has a horrible slow...

1919
02:20:12,122 --> 02:20:14,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Rendering of tits slash boobs.

1920
02:20:14,384 --> 02:20:15,786
[SPEAKER_04]: Rendering of boobs.

1921
02:20:16,106 --> 02:20:16,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Tits.

1922
02:20:16,887 --> 02:20:17,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, good.

1923
02:20:18,088 --> 02:20:23,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft says a horrible, slow maker or company.

1924
02:20:24,174 --> 02:20:25,676
[SPEAKER_04]: He's saying Nintendo is slow.

1925
02:20:25,816 --> 02:20:26,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it?

1926
02:20:26,537 --> 02:20:26,877
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.

1927
02:20:26,917 --> 02:20:27,258
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.

1928
02:20:27,478 --> 02:20:27,778
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1929
02:20:27,818 --> 02:20:28,619
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see how that pays off.

1930
02:20:29,240 --> 02:20:29,540
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1931
02:20:29,960 --> 02:20:32,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Has a horrible, slow DarkSakura.

1932
02:20:33,464 --> 02:20:34,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Boob jiggle.

1933
02:20:34,775 --> 02:20:35,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Boob Jiggle!

1934
02:20:36,376 --> 02:20:38,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, that's really close.

1935
02:20:38,538 --> 02:20:39,359
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd say half a point.

1936
02:20:39,599 --> 02:20:40,139
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really close.

1937
02:20:40,159 --> 02:20:42,981
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wouldn't even say that a slow Boob Jiggle would be a bad thing.

1938
02:20:43,021 --> 02:20:48,005
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because, you know... Alan is the unofficial... I almost said Mass Effect judge.

1939
02:20:48,345 --> 02:20:52,669
[SPEAKER_04]: As the unofficial match game judge, do you think Boob Jiggle is a match with Boob Rendering?

1940
02:20:53,389 --> 02:20:54,070
[SPEAKER_04]: I will allow it.

1941
02:20:54,530 --> 02:20:55,351
[SPEAKER_04]: I will allow it!

1942
02:20:55,931 --> 02:20:58,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Two points for SSJ100 Matt.

1943
02:20:58,733 --> 02:20:59,594
[SPEAKER_04]: No points for Actdeft.

1944
02:20:59,734 --> 02:21:00,354
[SPEAKER_04]: It's okay, Actdeft.

1945
02:21:00,394 --> 02:21:00,715
[SPEAKER_04]: It's okay.

1946
02:21:01,714 --> 02:21:04,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Rachel, a horrible, slow... Booty.

1947
02:21:05,095 --> 02:21:05,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Booty!

1948
02:21:07,476 --> 02:21:09,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Booty and boobies are very different.

1949
02:21:09,577 --> 02:21:11,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people are tits, some people are ass.

1950
02:21:11,437 --> 02:21:13,538
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are two different answers for sure.

1951
02:21:13,598 --> 02:21:15,038
[SPEAKER_04]: If we gave them one, we're not going to give them both.

1952
02:21:15,419 --> 02:21:15,699
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1953
02:21:16,639 --> 02:21:22,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you are on record saying the Wii U has a horrible, slow...

1954
02:21:25,363 --> 02:21:36,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Adoption of online protocols Adoption of online protocols Good answer, but not a match Has a horrible, slow

1955
02:21:36,977 --> 02:22:06,284
[SPEAKER_04]: Bacon Grilling Peripheral Bacon Grilling Peripheral A very good Loki answer No, we don't want a horrible bacon grilling And I said the Wii U has a horrible, slow ego Ego Not a match Not a match Alright, so the score is 2-0 Actdeft, you still have two questions You still have two questions You could tie it up easy if you get one on each of these Alright, here we go to question number three

1956
02:22:08,407 --> 02:22:09,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Question number three.

1957
02:22:11,170 --> 02:22:17,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob was shocked to hear that the R4 cartridges were being banned everywhere.

1958
02:22:18,697 --> 02:22:27,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Upon hearing of the latest ban, Rob shouted at Alan, quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of blanks.

1959
02:22:31,307 --> 02:22:38,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob shouted at Alan, Quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of blank.

1960
02:22:38,915 --> 02:22:41,237
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know what to say for this one.

1961
02:22:41,617 --> 02:22:48,044
[SPEAKER_04]: In my stash of... Okay, I got one.

02:22:54,770 --> 02:22:55,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1964
02:22:55,430 --> 02:22:56,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki says ding.

1965
02:22:56,731 --> 02:22:57,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Rachel's still thinking.

1966
02:22:57,732 --> 02:22:58,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan says ding.

1967
02:22:58,732 --> 02:22:59,432
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all right, Rachel.

1968
02:22:59,753 --> 02:23:00,973
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we just met earlier tonight.

1969
02:23:01,013 --> 02:23:03,154
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be hard to think of a way to razz me.

1970
02:23:03,915 --> 02:23:04,715
[SPEAKER_04]: She's looking around.

1971
02:23:04,955 --> 02:23:06,376
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is this guy like?

1972
02:23:06,576 --> 02:23:07,677
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of stashes here.

1973
02:23:07,697 --> 02:23:09,978
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just trying to, you know.

1974
02:23:10,178 --> 02:23:10,618
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all right.

1975
02:23:11,038 --> 02:23:12,099
[SPEAKER_04]: You can make something up.

1976
02:23:12,139 --> 02:23:12,759
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll never know.

1977
02:23:12,959 --> 02:23:13,159
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1978
02:23:13,179 --> 02:23:13,680
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, ding.

1979
02:23:13,760 --> 02:23:14,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding.

1980
02:23:14,100 --> 02:23:14,920
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, ding it is.

1981
02:23:15,401 --> 02:23:15,641
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1982
02:23:15,741 --> 02:23:17,382
[SPEAKER_04]: And I see a ding from Actdeft.

1983
02:23:18,522 --> 02:23:19,883
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100, Matt, you ready to answer?

1984
02:23:20,899 --> 02:23:21,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I got one.

1985
02:23:21,199 --> 02:23:22,041
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go with a classic match game.

1986
02:23:38,115 --> 02:23:41,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Answer with Non-Cylon Occupied Caprica.

1987
02:23:41,397 --> 02:23:43,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Non-Cylon Occupied Caprica.

1988
02:23:44,280 --> 02:23:46,921
[SPEAKER_04]: My stash of Non-Cylon Occupied Caprica.

1989
02:23:47,322 --> 02:23:52,586
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how well that's going to go over with somebody who is brand new to the show tonight, but we'll see what happens.

1990
02:23:53,226 --> 02:23:56,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft says, dating sims and hentai games.

1991
02:23:57,129 --> 02:24:03,373
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to understand there are so many people that are like, what is non-Sylon, Apricide, Caprica, even me?

1992
02:24:03,433 --> 02:24:04,553
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't even say it right anymore.

1993
02:24:04,713 --> 02:24:05,714
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an old ass joke.

1994
02:24:05,754 --> 02:24:07,035
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a really funny joke.

1995
02:24:07,115 --> 02:24:10,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it would have been just about as funny as if he said a mustache of big black cocks.

1996
02:24:11,017 --> 02:24:12,418
[SPEAKER_04]: But he didn't.

1997
02:24:12,558 --> 02:24:12,859
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1998
02:24:12,999 --> 02:24:13,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

1999
02:24:14,440 --> 02:24:14,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Quick.

2000
02:24:14,720 --> 02:24:15,160
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

2001
02:24:17,179 --> 02:24:18,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I change my answer to that?

2002
02:24:18,240 --> 02:24:18,700
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you cannot.

2003
02:24:18,760 --> 02:24:19,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here we go.

2004
02:24:19,961 --> 02:24:20,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Quick.

2005
02:24:20,961 --> 02:24:24,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of... DarkSakura?

2006
02:24:25,123 --> 02:24:26,024
[SPEAKER_11]: Big black cocks.

2007
02:24:26,584 --> 02:24:27,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Big black cocks.

2008
02:24:29,186 --> 02:24:31,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and I didn't let him change the answer.

2009
02:24:31,987 --> 02:24:32,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2010
02:24:32,928 --> 02:24:33,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Quick.

2011
02:24:33,768 --> 02:24:35,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Hide the... Did I really read your mind?

2012
02:24:37,650 --> 02:24:38,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, quick.

2013
02:24:38,731 --> 02:24:39,552
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you expect?

2014
02:24:39,572 --> 02:24:43,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone was talking about, you know, drawings of vaginas earlier.

2015
02:24:43,175 --> 02:24:44,376
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true, that's true.

2016
02:24:44,416 --> 02:24:50,522
[SPEAKER_04]: She's got porn on the... It sounds like Actdeft's answer of Dating Sims and Hentai Games almost was a match there.

2017
02:24:51,102 --> 02:24:52,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Dating Sims and Hentai Games.

2018
02:24:52,523 --> 02:24:57,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Rachel, my stash of... Twilight Books.

2019
02:24:57,628 --> 02:24:58,689
[SPEAKER_04]: Twilight Books?

2020
02:24:58,849 --> 02:24:59,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Get out!

2021
02:25:02,952 --> 02:25:04,033
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't own Twilight Books.

2022
02:25:04,113 --> 02:25:04,814
[SPEAKER_04]: You made that up.

2023
02:25:05,248 --> 02:25:06,910
[SPEAKER_12]: I could have said Fifty Shades of Grey.

2024
02:25:06,970 --> 02:25:07,671
[SPEAKER_12]: Look on the bright side.

2025
02:25:08,172 --> 02:25:08,632
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

2026
02:25:08,692 --> 02:25:08,912
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2027
02:25:08,932 --> 02:25:09,413
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you that.

2028
02:25:09,553 --> 02:25:11,856
[SPEAKER_10]: Does Rob look like a 14-year-old Mormon girl?

2029
02:25:12,817 --> 02:25:16,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Well... If only we were a TV show.

2030
02:25:16,922 --> 02:25:17,262
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2031
02:25:17,643 --> 02:25:18,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, quick.

2032
02:25:18,544 --> 02:25:21,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of... Cat pictures.

2033
02:25:22,248 --> 02:25:23,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Cat pictures.

2034
02:25:23,830 --> 02:25:24,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Good answer.

2035
02:25:24,951 --> 02:25:25,332
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a match.

2036
02:25:26,750 --> 02:25:33,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan, quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of... New, still-in-box President Cat merchandise.

2037
02:25:33,977 --> 02:25:37,121
[SPEAKER_04]: New, still-in-box President Cat merchandise.

2038
02:25:37,421 --> 02:25:37,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a match.

2039
02:25:38,902 --> 02:25:40,884
[SPEAKER_04]: And my answer, the most important one, clearly.

2040
02:25:41,625 --> 02:25:46,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of... Disney pins?

2041
02:25:48,396 --> 02:25:49,418
[SPEAKER_11]: That's very accurate.

2042
02:25:49,498 --> 02:25:49,839
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

2043
02:25:50,240 --> 02:25:52,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry I played it straight on that one.

2044
02:25:53,507 --> 02:25:54,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Womp womp.

2045
02:25:55,130 --> 02:25:56,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, it is still 2-0.

2046
02:25:58,342 --> 02:25:58,642
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

2047
02:25:58,742 --> 02:25:59,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Shane is in chat.

2048
02:25:59,583 --> 02:26:03,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Shane Alinko in chat says, I own the Twilight books and I'm not a 14-year-old Mormon girl.

2049
02:26:03,766 --> 02:26:04,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you are.

2050
02:26:04,987 --> 02:26:07,269
[SPEAKER_12]: You make me very sad, person on chat.

2051
02:26:07,809 --> 02:26:10,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft says, fuck, I was going to say President Cat.

2052
02:26:10,271 --> 02:26:11,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Woulda, coulda, shoulda.

2053
02:26:12,393 --> 02:26:14,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Dating Sims is a pretty good answer, though, even though I don't own any.

2054
02:26:15,295 --> 02:26:15,596
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2055
02:26:16,036 --> 02:26:17,017
[SPEAKER_09]: I have Dating Sims.

2056
02:26:17,577 --> 02:26:18,117
[SPEAKER_09]: They're yowie.

2057
02:26:18,438 --> 02:26:21,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Here is your chance to close the gap, Actdeft.

2058
02:26:21,800 --> 02:26:23,302
[SPEAKER_04]: You feeling pretty good about this, SSJ100Map?

2059
02:26:24,512 --> 02:26:25,273
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm feeling golden.

2060
02:26:25,333 --> 02:26:26,193
[SPEAKER_04]: You're feeling golden.

2061
02:26:26,213 --> 02:26:26,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Here you go.

2062
02:26:26,994 --> 02:26:28,415
[SPEAKER_04]: One more question.

2063
02:26:28,475 --> 02:26:29,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

2064
02:26:29,496 --> 02:26:30,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Last question.

2065
02:26:31,918 --> 02:26:38,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Peter Molyneux recently advertised Goddess on the Cube in Curiosity.

2066
02:26:39,784 --> 02:26:47,630
[SPEAKER_04]: It turns out that what Peter put inside the Cube is actually just an ad for blank.

2067
02:26:49,738 --> 02:26:51,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Y'all know Curiosity, What's in the Cube?

2068
02:26:52,160 --> 02:26:59,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Goddess was advertised on the Cube, and it turns out what Peter put in the Cube is actually just an ad for blank.

2069
02:27:03,049 --> 02:27:06,472
[SPEAKER_04]: What is in the Cube is actually just an ad for blank.

2070
02:27:06,932 --> 02:27:08,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding in a major way.

2071
02:27:08,654 --> 02:27:09,074
[SPEAKER_12]: Ding.

2072
02:27:09,835 --> 02:27:10,155
Ding.

2073
02:27:13,666 --> 02:27:13,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding.

2074
02:27:14,207 --> 02:27:15,528
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you say Ding, Jamie?

2075
02:27:15,608 --> 02:27:16,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I did.

2076
02:27:16,208 --> 02:27:19,131
[SPEAKER_10]: I said, in a major way, on top of, way to listen, Rob.

2077
02:27:19,291 --> 02:27:21,113
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't listening to you because I was thinking of an answer.

2078
02:27:22,194 --> 02:27:24,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though I think of the questions before the show, I don't think of the answers.

2079
02:27:25,617 --> 02:27:26,117
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

2080
02:27:26,137 --> 02:27:27,819
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a likely story, but I don't believe you.

2081
02:27:28,139 --> 02:27:28,480
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2082
02:27:29,020 --> 02:27:30,441
[SPEAKER_04]: An ad for Blank.

2083
02:27:31,102 --> 02:27:31,462
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2084
02:27:31,923 --> 02:27:35,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like Actdeft is Ding and SSJ100, Matt, you ready with an answer?

2085
02:27:36,192 --> 02:27:36,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

2086
02:27:36,632 --> 02:27:36,993
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2087
02:27:37,093 --> 02:27:40,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Peter Molyneux recently advertised Goddess on the Cube in Curiosity.

2088
02:27:41,016 --> 02:27:47,801
[SPEAKER_04]: It turns out that what Peter put in the Cube is actually just an ad for... Ovaltine.

2089
02:27:48,181 --> 02:27:49,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Ovaltine.

2090
02:27:49,242 --> 02:27:53,065
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Ovaltine.

2091
02:27:54,858 --> 02:27:55,278
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

2092
02:28:18,007 --> 02:28:20,989
[SPEAKER_04]: What he put in the cube is actually just an ad for?

2093
02:28:21,289 --> 02:28:21,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Propel.

2094
02:28:22,150 --> 02:28:22,930
[SPEAKER_04]: Propel!

2095
02:28:24,391 --> 02:28:25,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going old school tonight.

2096
02:28:25,572 --> 02:28:27,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you guys and the references.

2097
02:28:27,313 --> 02:28:27,733
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2098
02:28:28,193 --> 02:28:28,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Good answer.

2099
02:28:28,834 --> 02:28:29,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a match.

2100
02:28:29,694 --> 02:28:29,915
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2101
02:28:29,955 --> 02:28:33,517
[SPEAKER_04]: What Peter put in the cube is actually just an ad for?

2102
02:28:33,637 --> 02:28:33,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Rachel?

2103
02:28:34,778 --> 02:28:36,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Goddess Catch Em All.

2104
02:28:36,579 --> 02:28:38,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Goddess Catch Em All!

2105
02:28:41,371 --> 02:28:42,291
[SPEAKER_12]: It burns, doesn't it?

2106
02:28:43,052 --> 02:28:43,952
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a good burn.

2107
02:28:44,592 --> 02:28:49,335
[SPEAKER_04]: Ladies and gentlemen, who knew that Rachel was the 24th Magus, everybody?

2108
02:28:49,615 --> 02:28:50,416
[SPEAKER_04]: Here in studio.

2109
02:28:52,097 --> 02:28:53,398
[SPEAKER_10]: I will explain this to you.

2110
02:28:53,418 --> 02:28:54,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you'll have to explain that later.

2111
02:28:54,979 --> 02:28:55,539
[SPEAKER_10]: Off radio.

2112
02:28:57,554 --> 02:28:58,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Is she going to break a soundboard table now?

2113
02:28:59,575 --> 02:29:00,095
[SPEAKER_04]: She might.

2114
02:29:00,335 --> 02:29:00,675
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2115
02:29:00,715 --> 02:29:03,316
[SPEAKER_04]: This table's a lot sturdier than the one that Drew broke.

2116
02:29:03,576 --> 02:29:06,857
[SPEAKER_04]: After nobody matches her, she might just flip the table over.

2117
02:29:06,897 --> 02:29:07,277
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

2118
02:29:07,657 --> 02:29:11,699
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Loki, what Peter put in the cube is actually just an ad for?

2119
02:29:12,279 --> 02:29:14,980
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't know how to pronounce this, but I'm going to try to.

2120
02:29:15,200 --> 02:29:17,161
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Schrodinger.

2121
02:29:19,761 --> 02:29:21,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Would it be Schrodinger, Schrodinger's cat?

2122
02:29:22,082 --> 02:29:24,943
[SPEAKER_03]: No, everyone likes cats, so it's just Schrodinger.

2123
02:29:25,764 --> 02:29:26,924
[SPEAKER_11]: See how he likes it.

2124
02:29:28,779 --> 02:29:29,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Clever answer.

2125
02:29:29,859 --> 02:29:31,900
[SPEAKER_04]: That's too intellectual for you, Loki.

2126
02:29:31,960 --> 02:29:32,260
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2127
02:29:32,280 --> 02:29:34,121
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

2128
02:29:34,141 --> 02:29:36,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Should I have said penises or like, you know?

2129
02:29:36,221 --> 02:29:37,742
[SPEAKER_04]: You are a Mensa member after all.

2130
02:29:37,842 --> 02:29:38,182
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2131
02:29:39,162 --> 02:29:41,503
[SPEAKER_04]: It is just an ad for, Alan?

2132
02:29:42,303 --> 02:29:44,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Pure, unsubstantiated hype, the video game.

2133
02:29:45,424 --> 02:29:48,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Pure, unsubstantiated hype, the video game.

2134
02:29:49,045 --> 02:29:50,446
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, that's not as good as they say.

2135
02:29:50,867 --> 02:29:51,227
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2136
02:29:51,748 --> 02:29:53,089
[SPEAKER_04]: And lastly, my answer.

2137
02:29:53,129 --> 02:29:59,135
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see if it's a match for Actdeft with the VOG Network or whatever Matt said.

2138
02:29:59,175 --> 02:30:00,216
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't even remember now.

2139
02:30:00,336 --> 02:30:00,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Ovaltine.

2140
02:30:00,937 --> 02:30:01,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Ovaltine.

2141
02:30:03,779 --> 02:30:04,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is.

2142
02:30:04,380 --> 02:30:08,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Peter Molyneux recently advertised Goddess on the Cube in Curiosity.

2143
02:30:08,884 --> 02:30:13,128
[SPEAKER_04]: It turns out that what Peter put in the cube is actually just an ad for...

2144
02:30:14,107 --> 02:30:14,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Douche.

2145
02:30:15,089 --> 02:30:15,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Good night, everybody.

2146
02:30:18,956 --> 02:30:21,601
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to conclude the match game tonight.

2147
02:30:22,122 --> 02:30:22,964
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100 Matt wins!

2148
02:30:26,109 --> 02:30:30,151
[SPEAKER_04]: in a score of 2-0, Alan.

2149
02:30:30,171 --> 02:30:30,531
[SPEAKER_04]: 2-0.

2150
02:30:31,232 --> 02:30:31,552
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2151
02:30:33,453 --> 02:30:36,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, thank you so much for playing, but sorry you're a loser.

2152
02:30:37,035 --> 02:30:37,595
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the door.

2153
02:30:38,195 --> 02:30:40,377
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100, Matt, congratulations.

2154
02:30:40,557 --> 02:30:46,040
[SPEAKER_04]: You win, and as the winner, you get to pimp or promote anything you want to on the program tonight.

2155
02:30:48,341 --> 02:30:52,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't really have anything to promote, so I'm just going to promote the VOG Network.

2156
02:30:53,867 --> 02:30:57,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw, it's like the ad was really in the center after all.

2157
02:30:57,649 --> 02:30:57,989
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2158
02:30:58,009 --> 02:30:58,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Feel the love.

2159
02:30:58,509 --> 02:30:59,689
[SPEAKER_11]: You're so nice.

2160
02:30:59,849 --> 02:31:00,710
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the feels.

2161
02:31:01,010 --> 02:31:01,550
[SPEAKER_04]: The feels.

2162
02:31:01,650 --> 02:31:01,950
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2163
02:31:02,230 --> 02:31:02,890
[SPEAKER_04]: All the feels.

2164
02:31:03,210 --> 02:31:04,671
[SPEAKER_04]: S2100Mac, congratulations.

2165
02:31:04,691 --> 02:31:07,132
[SPEAKER_04]: You won the first match game on OLR in like a year and a half.

2166
02:31:07,192 --> 02:31:08,952
[SPEAKER_04]: So walk away with that trophy.

2167
02:31:09,392 --> 02:31:11,353
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe somebody will try to take it from you in 2013.

2168
02:31:11,413 --> 02:31:11,953
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

2169
02:31:13,134 --> 02:31:13,594
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2170
02:31:13,634 --> 02:31:14,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good night, buddy.

2171
02:31:15,748 --> 02:31:16,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good night, guys.

2172
02:31:16,488 --> 02:31:16,989
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, bye.

2173
02:31:17,889 --> 02:31:18,889
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that was fun.

2174
02:31:18,929 --> 02:31:19,249
[SPEAKER_04]: That was fun.

2175
02:31:19,269 --> 02:31:19,990
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to do that again tonight.

2176
02:31:20,230 --> 02:31:24,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Alan, for walking in and doing a cameo, not like I pressured you into it or anything.

2177
02:31:24,992 --> 02:31:25,412
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome.

2178
02:31:25,812 --> 02:31:27,873
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, the taquitos were A+.

2179
02:31:28,013 --> 02:31:28,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2180
02:31:28,846 --> 02:31:29,727
[SPEAKER_10]: It was quite delicious.

2181
02:31:29,767 --> 02:31:30,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2182
02:31:30,307 --> 02:31:31,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan takes good care of us during the show.

2183
02:31:31,808 --> 02:31:32,449
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate it.

2184
02:31:33,150 --> 02:31:33,470
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2185
02:31:34,911 --> 02:31:46,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Let us move on with a few more stories and then we're going to open up the Skype line for regular calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or of course our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2186
02:31:46,600 --> 02:31:52,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we have more stuff we've got to get to before we get to the stories though such as the mailbag.

2187
02:31:56,588 --> 02:32:06,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us your emails and DarkSakura will dive into the mailbag head first and read a few emails that tickles your fancy.

2188
02:32:07,052 --> 02:32:08,293
[SPEAKER_04]: What's inside the mailbag?

2189
02:32:12,233 --> 02:32:21,696
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you ever tried placing your games in a numbered list and picking a number at random?

2190
02:32:22,236 --> 02:32:29,158
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been surprised on many occasions to find out how much fun I've had playing an old game or playing a game I thought I was not in the mood for thanks to this method.

2191
02:32:30,078 --> 02:32:33,679
[SPEAKER_10]: MMORPGs get a number for each character.

2192
02:32:36,408 --> 02:32:37,549
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care and happy gaming.

2193
02:32:59,434 --> 02:33:06,118
[SPEAKER_10]: We tried this and got so wiped out trying to list every freaking game that we own that no.

2194
02:33:06,718 --> 02:33:08,219
[SPEAKER_12]: It spread out to imaginary numbers.

2195
02:33:08,239 --> 02:33:10,061
[SPEAKER_12]: There was algebra involved and it wasn't pretty.

2196
02:33:11,241 --> 02:33:15,124
[SPEAKER_04]: You had to use the E plus 10 and all that stuff to get the games in there.

2197
02:33:15,424 --> 02:33:16,184
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2198
02:33:41,291 --> 02:33:42,411
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I do, actually.

2199
02:33:42,672 --> 02:33:43,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, here's the other question.

2200
02:33:43,512 --> 02:33:45,292
[SPEAKER_04]: Would each copy of Space Harrier get a number?

2201
02:33:47,813 --> 02:33:48,093
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2202
02:33:48,573 --> 02:33:49,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Next email.

2203
02:33:51,214 --> 02:33:52,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Next up.

2204
02:33:53,274 --> 02:33:54,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that was the one I just read.

2205
02:33:56,015 --> 02:33:57,096
[SPEAKER_10]: They're very small.

2206
02:33:57,556 --> 02:33:59,716
[SPEAKER_10]: This one comes from Will.

2207
02:34:01,177 --> 02:34:04,718
[SPEAKER_10]: I strangely enjoy when Rob breaks into the show to give the VOG passphrase.

2208
02:34:04,758 --> 02:34:05,778
[SPEAKER_10]: He sounds so serious.

2209
02:34:07,250 --> 02:34:07,710
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it?

2210
02:34:08,571 --> 02:34:11,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Today's password is cheeseball.

2211
02:34:11,994 --> 02:34:13,295
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not really the password.

2212
02:34:13,515 --> 02:34:13,755
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

2213
02:34:14,416 --> 02:34:14,936
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't pick that.

2214
02:34:14,996 --> 02:34:16,878
[SPEAKER_04]: The password... It's randomly generated.

2215
02:34:16,918 --> 02:34:22,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the passphrases get picked for me after the show with a little thing that Bobby wrote.

2216
02:34:22,042 --> 02:34:23,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Today's passcode is cock.

2217
02:34:24,424 --> 02:34:25,045
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not.

2218
02:34:25,185 --> 02:34:26,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't put that in the box.

2219
02:34:26,306 --> 02:34:27,927
[SPEAKER_04]: She doesn't know it because we don't know it until after the show.

2220
02:34:27,947 --> 02:34:28,728
[SPEAKER_08]: What if a elephant did pop up?

2221
02:34:29,008 --> 02:34:32,773
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to have cock because Bobby filtered all the adult words off of it, I'm sure.

2222
02:34:33,253 --> 02:34:34,135
[SPEAKER_12]: Dang it, Bobby!

2223
02:34:35,096 --> 02:34:39,481
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll be spelled with a zero and a five in place of the S. You know what, Bobby?

2224
02:34:39,541 --> 02:34:40,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Remind me.

2225
02:34:40,122 --> 02:34:45,469
[SPEAKER_04]: April Fool's Day next year, people who put naughty words in the box unlock a bar of soap trophy.

2226
02:34:45,569 --> 02:34:46,310
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we make that happen?

2227
02:34:47,150 --> 02:34:48,792
[SPEAKER_10]: You got four months to work on it.

2228
02:34:49,593 --> 02:34:52,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a chance for me to re-pimp this, though, because we haven't talked about it in a while.

2229
02:34:53,356 --> 02:35:01,884
[SPEAKER_04]: If you listen to the shows live at vognetwork.com, you can check into the show as the show is happening and get your five VOG points, which go for the loot.

2230
02:35:02,205 --> 02:35:03,466
[SPEAKER_04]: And what do VOG points get you?

2231
02:35:03,966 --> 02:35:05,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely nothing.

2232
02:35:05,648 --> 02:35:07,711
[SPEAKER_04]: But what does Foursquare and Facebook check-ins give you?

2233
02:35:07,751 --> 02:35:09,713
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a fun little game within a game.

2234
02:35:10,114 --> 02:35:13,378
[SPEAKER_04]: And someday there may be more to come from it in 2013.

2235
02:35:13,438 --> 02:35:15,160
[SPEAKER_04]: We're throwing around ideas.

2236
02:35:15,180 --> 02:35:15,240
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

2237
02:35:19,665 --> 02:35:20,946
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2238
02:35:43,408 --> 02:35:50,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Although you still can check in just to register yourself as you listen to the podcast and you listen live just to see if there were any differences.

2239
02:35:51,050 --> 02:35:52,171
[SPEAKER_04]: But you don't get the extra points.

2240
02:35:52,431 --> 02:35:54,031
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyhow, we hope you'll play along.

2241
02:35:54,291 --> 02:36:01,193
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a fun thing to do at vognetwork.com and we do look to adding some fun little no prizes.

2242
02:36:01,253 --> 02:36:05,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe the person with the most amount of points will get to program the station for a day.

2243
02:36:05,795 --> 02:36:06,935
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm throwing it out there.

2244
02:36:07,335 --> 02:36:08,195
[SPEAKER_04]: These aren't actual things.

2245
02:36:08,476 --> 02:36:09,656
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're looking to doing things like that.

2246
02:36:09,716 --> 02:36:12,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Translated to give Bobby a migraine for a day.

2247
02:36:14,197 --> 02:36:18,599
[SPEAKER_04]: And Tiger Claw and Actdeft in chat remind us, bragging rights is what you get.

2248
02:36:18,840 --> 02:36:19,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Bragging rights.

2249
02:36:19,980 --> 02:36:24,542
[SPEAKER_10]: I like no prizes like Marvel used to do where the people would just get a blank envelope.

2250
02:36:24,822 --> 02:36:36,808
[SPEAKER_04]: I think maybe in 2013 what we should do, especially since we're all getting into, like you're doing crocheting and all these different projects, we should give our leaderboard leader every month a homemade prize for

2251
02:36:37,208 --> 02:36:38,629
[SPEAKER_04]: That means I have to make it.

2252
02:36:38,649 --> 02:36:39,949
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, it doesn't have to be you every time.

2253
02:36:40,089 --> 02:36:40,429
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do one.

2254
02:36:40,449 --> 02:36:41,910
[SPEAKER_09]: We can make something out of popsicle sticks.

2255
02:36:42,410 --> 02:36:44,451
[SPEAKER_04]: But remember, there's more than just us on VOG.

2256
02:36:44,651 --> 02:36:44,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

2257
02:36:45,791 --> 02:36:47,111
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be like, you know, one week.

2258
02:36:47,171 --> 02:36:51,553
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be maybe Brad from PodCulture could send, you know, something homemade.

2259
02:36:51,573 --> 02:36:52,393
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what we should do.

2260
02:36:53,294 --> 02:36:53,994
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a contest.

2261
02:36:54,074 --> 02:36:55,034
[SPEAKER_10]: It starts in January.

2262
02:36:55,634 --> 02:36:55,975
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay?

2263
02:36:56,535 --> 02:37:04,397
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoever gets the top of the leaderboard the most times in the period of a year gets an orange beanie crocheted by me.

2264
02:37:04,417 --> 02:37:04,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

2265
02:37:06,328 --> 02:37:07,229
[SPEAKER_04]: Last email, this comes from Travis

2266
02:37:31,127 --> 02:37:32,248
[SPEAKER_10]: No, not Donovan.

2267
02:37:33,408 --> 02:37:34,049
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, gang.

2268
02:37:34,169 --> 02:37:35,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Haven't wrote or called in a while.

2269
02:37:35,449 --> 02:37:40,112
[SPEAKER_10]: Thought I would drop a line and say, hey, I got a Wii U over the weekend and heard Rob talking about his last episode.

2270
02:37:40,732 --> 02:37:41,893
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm happy with it so far.

2271
02:37:42,093 --> 02:37:43,253
[SPEAKER_10]: I have an eight-yo.

2272
02:37:43,654 --> 02:37:44,234
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, year old.

2273
02:37:46,096 --> 02:37:47,577
[SPEAKER_10]: and he absolutely loves it.

2274
02:37:47,697 --> 02:37:49,639
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, friends and family have a blast with it too.

2275
02:37:50,199 --> 02:37:54,182
[SPEAKER_10]: Just wondering, after a week of having it, what do you think?

2276
02:37:54,983 --> 02:37:55,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob?

2277
02:37:56,024 --> 02:37:56,764
[SPEAKER_11]: Get out of the fridge.

2278
02:37:56,784 --> 02:37:57,605
[SPEAKER_11]: Come answer the question.

2279
02:37:57,625 --> 02:37:58,606
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted an Oreo.

2280
02:37:58,686 --> 02:37:59,427
[SPEAKER_11]: I want an Oreo.

2281
02:37:59,987 --> 02:38:00,327
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

2282
02:38:02,188 --> 02:38:03,169
[SPEAKER_04]: You want an Oreo too, Rachel?

2283
02:38:03,449 --> 02:38:04,009
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get you an Oreo later.

2284
02:38:04,069 --> 02:38:04,349
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good.

2285
02:38:04,509 --> 02:38:05,309
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2286
02:38:07,370 --> 02:38:09,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I talked about the Wii U at the top of the show.

2287
02:38:09,210 --> 02:38:10,551
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I have a lot else to add.

2288
02:38:11,051 --> 02:38:13,832
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not disappointed with my investment.

2289
02:38:14,192 --> 02:38:20,554
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, how important is Mario and Nintendo Land and some of these like Zombie U?

2290
02:38:20,614 --> 02:38:22,155
[SPEAKER_04]: How important are those games to you?

2291
02:38:22,275 --> 02:38:25,356
[SPEAKER_04]: If you think you can wait on those games till 2013, then wait.

2292
02:38:25,776 --> 02:38:29,777
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you want to play them now and you have the financial resources available to play them now,

2293
02:38:29,997 --> 02:38:30,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Then go get one.

2294
02:38:31,459 --> 02:38:31,880
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun.

2295
02:38:33,602 --> 02:38:34,143
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep talking.

2296
02:38:36,466 --> 02:38:37,147
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm done.

2297
02:38:37,167 --> 02:38:44,177
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I have to say on the Wii U. I talked for like 40 minutes during part A. Oreos from the fridge are the best.

2298
02:38:45,178 --> 02:38:46,320
[SPEAKER_11]: Matt, you want one?

2299
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:47,181
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

2300
02:38:48,041 --> 02:38:49,002
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not want an Oreo.

2301
02:38:49,442 --> 02:38:52,725
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm pretty excited about Lego City, a new Zelda and an F-Zero game.

2302
02:38:53,705 --> 02:38:59,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Being a PlayStation fanboy and a PC gamer, I have to say I'm not blown away, but still very impressed with it.

2303
02:38:59,610 --> 02:39:00,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's all in caps.

2304
02:39:00,351 --> 02:39:01,531
[SPEAKER_10]: How else am I supposed to emote that?

2305
02:39:03,213 --> 02:39:07,416
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, by the way, I friend requested you, but we'll have to do it again under a different name.

2306
02:39:07,456 --> 02:39:11,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Long story short, I had to get a replacement system as my first one I purchased was faulty.

2307
02:39:11,699 --> 02:39:11,959
[SPEAKER_10]: Quoty.

2308
02:39:12,200 --> 02:39:12,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Faulty.

2309
02:39:14,161 --> 02:39:14,982
[SPEAKER_04]: That sucks.

2310
02:39:15,802 --> 02:39:16,963
[SPEAKER_04]: You have some bad luck.

2311
02:39:17,564 --> 02:39:17,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Done.

2312
02:39:21,678 --> 02:39:29,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason is quick to correct me in the chat room at live.vognetwork.com Gmail hasn't been in beta for more than a few years now.

2313
02:39:29,440 --> 02:39:30,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

2314
02:39:31,220 --> 02:39:34,341
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been in beta for like, what, eight months?

2315
02:39:35,341 --> 02:39:37,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Gmail was in beta for like six years.

2316
02:39:38,481 --> 02:39:39,342
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a ways to go.

2317
02:39:39,722 --> 02:39:40,702
[SPEAKER_12]: Hyperbole what now?

2318
02:39:42,662 --> 02:39:42,942
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2319
02:39:44,203 --> 02:39:46,063
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into the FUs of the week.

2320
02:40:01,892 --> 02:40:09,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Rachel, since you're new to the FUs of the Week, I don't know if Jamie told you about this in the car ride, but this is the part of the show where we just get to rant.

2321
02:40:09,616 --> 02:40:09,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

2322
02:40:10,517 --> 02:40:11,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, because we have your attention.

2323
02:40:11,857 --> 02:40:13,799
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I have your attention, I like to rant.

2324
02:40:14,199 --> 02:40:14,979
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's the FUs of the Week.

2325
02:40:15,660 --> 02:40:16,160
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura?

2326
02:40:16,560 --> 02:40:18,221
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't particularly have an FU.

2327
02:40:18,961 --> 02:40:23,104
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a thank you to someone for saving me the trouble of doing what I planned on doing anyway.

2328
02:40:25,625 --> 02:40:26,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Hiding a body?

2329
02:40:27,026 --> 02:40:27,146
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

2330
02:40:28,055 --> 02:40:28,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

2331
02:40:29,197 --> 02:40:29,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Loki.

2332
02:40:30,618 --> 02:40:36,426
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to do the whole ride over here because for some reason, like, everybody was out to try to kill me or something on the road.

2333
02:40:36,846 --> 02:40:38,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, there's a dude... I hate it when they do this.

2334
02:40:39,109 --> 02:40:42,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, when there's people waiting to, like, pull out of an inner... either, like, a...

2335
02:40:43,254 --> 02:40:44,314
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

2336
02:41:08,991 --> 02:41:10,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Take fucking attention, people.

2337
02:41:10,575 --> 02:41:11,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, you're going to kill somebody.

2338
02:41:12,920 --> 02:41:13,621
[SPEAKER_03]: And hopefully not me.

2339
02:41:14,922 --> 02:41:35,366
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU of the week goes to Oreos for being so delicious and addicting Oh my god, but no, the other thing about that is I want to give an FU to the fact that I never got to have the birthday cake Oreos because they disappeared from shelves so fast and, and, real problems guys I never got to have the candy corn Oreos because they disappeared from shelves so fast Why can I make these special Oreos if I can't find them?

2340
02:41:35,606 --> 02:41:41,887
[SPEAKER_04]: And while I'm at it, FU to the fact that there are no pumpkin kisses this year That is a travesty

2341
02:41:43,109 --> 02:41:44,089
[SPEAKER_04]: True Travesty.

2342
02:41:44,449 --> 02:41:47,190
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't you hold on to like a pack of those for like six months?

2343
02:41:47,250 --> 02:41:48,770
[SPEAKER_04]: I did and they were still delicious.

2344
02:41:49,490 --> 02:41:50,291
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry not sorry.

2345
02:41:51,331 --> 02:41:52,551
[SPEAKER_10]: I partook of them too.

2346
02:41:52,931 --> 02:41:54,172
[SPEAKER_10]: eBay changed their logo!

2347
02:41:54,792 --> 02:41:55,932
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like months ago.

2348
02:41:56,052 --> 02:41:59,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but I haven't looked at eBay in months.

2349
02:42:00,413 --> 02:42:03,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, and last but not least, Rachel, do you have any FUs you want to get out?

2350
02:42:04,414 --> 02:42:09,135
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you know, I'd like to say FU to Michael Bay because, you know, you can never FU that guy enough.

2351
02:42:09,827 --> 02:42:12,428
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, on eBay, they are... That is a worthy first FU.

2352
02:42:12,468 --> 02:42:12,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job.

2353
02:42:12,928 --> 02:42:13,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job.

2354
02:42:13,328 --> 02:42:16,209
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, on eBay, they are selling those candy corn Oreos.

2355
02:42:17,510 --> 02:42:18,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck eBay.

2356
02:42:18,990 --> 02:42:20,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Limited edition, like... 15 bucks.

2357
02:42:21,191 --> 02:42:24,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Brad from PodCulture says, Rob Roberts, try the gingerbread Oreos.

2358
02:42:26,293 --> 02:42:28,193
[SPEAKER_04]: They have gingerbread Oreos?

2359
02:42:28,733 --> 02:42:29,774
[SPEAKER_10]: I need this in my life.

2360
02:42:30,014 --> 02:42:30,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Ermager!

2361
02:42:31,734 --> 02:42:32,435
[SPEAKER_10]: I need this in my life.

2362
02:42:32,455 --> 02:42:32,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Gingerbread!

2363
02:42:36,010 --> 02:42:38,192
[SPEAKER_10]: I need a cat in my life, Rob.

2364
02:43:05,151 --> 02:43:09,153
[SPEAKER_03]: However, because, no, not day one, because of their DRM.

2365
02:43:09,813 --> 02:43:17,836
[SPEAKER_03]: They said, though, that the extra sales that they got at that time had helped them have new staff members for this year's release for Football Manager 13.

2366
02:43:18,896 --> 02:43:25,959
[SPEAKER_03]: And had they been hired day one, they probably wouldn't have the money to have the extra staff.

2367
02:43:26,699 --> 02:43:27,020
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

2368
02:43:28,260 --> 02:43:44,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right now, I guess the new game has a new DRM system, and as of right now, hasn't been cracked, although they haven't, I don't know when that came out, and they said that if they can hold on for three or four more weeks, then it'll really benefit retailers and themselves.

2369
02:43:48,186 --> 02:43:48,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it working?

2370
02:43:50,187 --> 02:43:58,511
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's good when it works in the effort to get people to actually legitimately buy your copies of your games.

2371
02:43:59,131 --> 02:44:11,617
[SPEAKER_03]: However, when you have it implemented in a way like Ubisoft does, where it hurts the actual consumers that buy your games and kind of punishes them, whereas the person that has the cracked copy has no issues, then that's the problem.

2372
02:44:11,637 --> 02:44:13,418
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just kind of have to find that happy medium in there.

2373
02:44:13,965 --> 02:44:21,808
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of think it's interesting how they talk about that like, you know, as long as we can hold off like three weeks before we get cracked, then we'll be good.

2374
02:44:21,888 --> 02:44:23,529
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll still sell a lot of copies of the game.

2375
02:44:23,889 --> 02:44:27,891
[SPEAKER_04]: I find it interesting that they just kind of give into the fact that like, yeah, hackers gonna hack.

2376
02:44:28,111 --> 02:44:29,631
[SPEAKER_04]: They're gonna get into the game eventually.

2377
02:44:30,112 --> 02:44:36,034
[SPEAKER_04]: But it also, you know, that mentality that the majority, the vast majority of games are in their first week.

2378
02:44:36,654 --> 02:44:43,037
[SPEAKER_04]: So I find it very interesting that it's like, as long as we can hold off to week three, enough people will have bought it by then that whatever at that point.

2379
02:44:43,937 --> 02:45:08,908
[SPEAKER_04]: very interesting but uh yeah I also agree with what Loki said as long as you know anti-piracy you got to do what you got to do but as long as it works so all right uh moving on to one more story tonight I can't believe this but uh if you're in Finland you've got some weird taste that's all I gotta say no offense but you guys have some weird taste you know what panties

2380
02:45:09,928 --> 02:45:10,148
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

2381
02:45:10,909 --> 02:45:13,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yes, but it means something different in Finnish.

2382
02:45:13,790 --> 02:45:18,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, she's referring to what is written on the can for Angry Birds Soda.

2383
02:45:19,552 --> 02:45:22,533
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Angry Birds has been licensed for everything.

2384
02:45:22,613 --> 02:45:27,935
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure there's Angry Birds diapers at this point and whatever, even here in America.

2385
02:45:28,035 --> 02:45:31,176
[SPEAKER_04]: But over in Finland, they have Angry Birds Soda.

2386
02:45:31,816 --> 02:45:33,437
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's the crazy thing about it.

2387
02:45:34,777 --> 02:45:38,779
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually outselling Coke and Pepsi in Finland.

2388
02:45:40,132 --> 02:45:40,453
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

2389
02:45:42,443 --> 02:45:42,905
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright then.

2390
02:45:43,856 --> 02:45:50,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Peter Vesterbacca from Rovio says that the soda will make its way to Australia and New Zealand in the near future.

2391
02:45:51,119 --> 02:45:53,240
[SPEAKER_04]: And they say it will probably come to the U.S.

2392
02:45:53,300 --> 02:45:54,641
[SPEAKER_04]: eventually as well.

2393
02:45:55,461 --> 02:45:59,663
[SPEAKER_04]: So could Angry Birds someday outsell Coke and Pepsi here in America?

2394
02:45:59,983 --> 02:46:01,444
[SPEAKER_12]: I can only hope it's smelt flavored.

2395
02:46:02,385 --> 02:46:03,885
[SPEAKER_10]: In Alabama, everything is a Coke.

2396
02:46:04,345 --> 02:46:05,726
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't matter what drink it is, it's Coke.

2397
02:46:05,746 --> 02:46:06,786
[SPEAKER_12]: So I doubt it.

2398
02:46:07,487 --> 02:46:09,148
[SPEAKER_12]: Unless you're in the Midwest, then it becomes pop.

2399
02:46:09,448 --> 02:46:10,088
[SPEAKER_12]: Everything's pop.

2400
02:46:10,268 --> 02:46:10,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I hate that.

2401
02:46:11,029 --> 02:46:12,010
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's like nails on chalkboard.

2402
02:46:12,030 --> 02:46:12,550
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate pop.

2403
02:46:12,650 --> 02:46:16,053
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate... Pop is what you do to bubble gum, not soda.

2404
02:46:16,293 --> 02:46:17,574
[SPEAKER_03]: How about a sody pop?

2405
02:46:17,934 --> 02:46:18,695
[SPEAKER_04]: No!

2406
02:46:19,376 --> 02:46:23,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Soda pop was the name of one of the boxers in the original Punch-Out!!

2407
02:46:24,440 --> 02:46:25,721
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where it stays.

2408
02:46:27,082 --> 02:46:33,107
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna be weird one of these days when Mario becomes less recognizable to Red Bird.

2409
02:46:35,222 --> 02:46:36,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Give the birds fucking names!

2410
02:46:37,224 --> 02:46:38,165
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously.

2411
02:46:39,006 --> 02:46:48,135
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to continue a trend of streamlining the shape and the name to the point where it's just going to be a dot on the screen and it will be because spelling the entire word is tiring.

2412
02:46:49,161 --> 02:46:56,747
[SPEAKER_04]: The Skype line is now open at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

2413
02:46:57,307 --> 02:47:01,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

2414
02:47:01,850 --> 02:47:03,091
[SPEAKER_04]: The Skype line is open.

2415
02:47:03,251 --> 02:47:04,252
[SPEAKER_03]: And there you go, Nintendo.

2416
02:47:04,272 --> 02:47:16,121
[SPEAKER_03]: You can totally rip off Angry Birds by creating bullet bills and then having its own game where you're just firing bullet bills and have them, I don't know, do something.

2417
02:47:17,482 --> 02:47:18,423
[SPEAKER_03]: You can combat this.

2418
02:47:19,321 --> 02:47:20,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, hello One more time

2419
02:47:46,961 --> 02:47:48,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you got to call Echo123.

2420
02:47:48,721 --> 02:47:49,001
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2421
02:47:49,842 --> 02:47:50,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's try another call.

2422
02:47:50,882 --> 02:47:51,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2423
02:47:51,922 --> 02:47:52,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2424
02:47:53,942 --> 02:47:55,343
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, this is Duke Nukem.

2425
02:47:56,583 --> 02:47:59,444
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering, what's your guys' favorite Thanksgiving item?

2426
02:47:59,464 --> 02:48:01,804
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't think it's been mentioned yet this episode.

2427
02:48:02,624 --> 02:48:06,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Duke Nukem wants to know, what is everybody's favorite Thanksgiving item?

2428
02:48:06,985 --> 02:48:09,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we haven't mentioned it yet this episode.

2429
02:48:09,486 --> 02:48:10,346
[SPEAKER_04]: What a good question.

2430
02:48:10,366 --> 02:48:12,626
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so happy it has absolutely nothing to do with video games.

2431
02:48:12,666 --> 02:48:13,966
[SPEAKER_04]: But we like to take a break once in a while.

2432
02:48:14,267 --> 02:48:16,247
[SPEAKER_04]: What's more important than video games, Duke Nukem?

2433
02:48:18,766 --> 02:48:19,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Food!

2434
02:48:19,447 --> 02:48:19,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Food!

2435
02:48:19,907 --> 02:48:20,488
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the answer.

2436
02:48:20,749 --> 02:48:22,291
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you say?

2437
02:48:22,771 --> 02:48:24,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.

2438
02:48:24,333 --> 02:48:26,376
[SPEAKER_04]: What's more important than video games, Duke Nukem?

2439
02:48:28,427 --> 02:48:30,128
[SPEAKER_10]: Pie, the answer is pie.

2440
02:48:30,248 --> 02:48:31,608
[SPEAKER_10]: No, the answer is Cox.

2441
02:48:31,848 --> 02:48:32,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2442
02:48:32,649 --> 02:48:33,509
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, all right.

2443
02:48:34,009 --> 02:48:36,390
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go around and get everybody's... Sorry, my phone is going out.

2444
02:48:36,670 --> 02:48:37,490
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right, that's all right.

2445
02:48:37,750 --> 02:48:39,851
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go around and get everybody's answers here for you.

2446
02:48:39,911 --> 02:48:42,312
[SPEAKER_04]: So what is everybody's favorite Thanksgiving item?

2447
02:48:42,832 --> 02:48:43,552
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

2448
02:48:43,752 --> 02:48:44,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Garris.

2449
02:48:45,853 --> 02:48:46,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Cooked Garris?

2450
02:48:47,574 --> 02:48:48,314
[SPEAKER_11]: No, oh, cooked?

2451
02:48:48,334 --> 02:48:55,797
[SPEAKER_10]: Calibrated to a crisp brown... You know, it has to be actually the chocolate chip pumpkin pie that Becky helped me make.

2452
02:48:56,557 --> 02:48:57,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Chocolate chip pumpkin pie.

2453
02:48:58,178 --> 02:48:58,759
[SPEAKER_10]: It was epic.

2454
02:48:59,119 --> 02:48:59,479
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2455
02:48:59,779 --> 02:49:00,020
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2456
02:49:00,620 --> 02:49:00,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Rachel.

2457
02:49:01,060 --> 02:49:03,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Turkey skin.

2458
02:49:03,962 --> 02:49:04,903
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, what, Duke Nukem?

2459
02:49:06,933 --> 02:49:08,975
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody has to claim the bacon-wrapped turkey.

2460
02:49:09,956 --> 02:49:10,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's right.

2461
02:49:12,318 --> 02:49:13,179
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just nasty.

2462
02:49:13,940 --> 02:49:14,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Swanson, yes.

2463
02:49:14,780 --> 02:49:15,161
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

2464
02:49:15,781 --> 02:49:19,465
[SPEAKER_04]: One more time, Rachel, because I got distracted by... It's turkey skin.

2465
02:49:19,485 --> 02:49:21,366
[SPEAKER_12]: Turkey skin.

2466
02:49:21,527 --> 02:49:24,249
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to say it like that, because otherwise, what is even the point?

2467
02:49:24,930 --> 02:49:25,210
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2468
02:49:25,230 --> 02:49:25,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

2469
02:49:26,011 --> 02:49:26,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

2470
02:49:27,120 --> 02:49:30,903
[SPEAKER_03]: Yams and pumpkin pie I don't know why, it's just like they...

2471
02:49:56,838 --> 02:50:02,301
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, they have this sweet yet, I don't know, sour kind of flavor the way my grandma makes them.

2472
02:50:03,082 --> 02:50:04,762
[SPEAKER_00]: She puts a little bit of lemon juice in there.

2473
02:50:04,782 --> 02:50:07,904
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like this thing that you don't have any other day of the year.

2474
02:50:08,745 --> 02:50:09,985
[SPEAKER_00]: And you always look forward to it.

2475
02:50:10,025 --> 02:50:13,207
[SPEAKER_00]: Just that one dish is worth another 364 days.

2476
02:50:14,007 --> 02:50:15,989
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a really sweet, sentimental answer.

2477
02:50:16,069 --> 02:50:23,673
[SPEAKER_04]: But I can tell that you're an imposter, Duke Nukem, because the real Duke Nukem would have said, my favorite Thanksgiving food is kicking ass.

2478
02:50:25,600 --> 02:50:30,462
[SPEAKER_00]: No, his favorite Thanksgiving food would be bubble gum and he'd be chewing it.

2479
02:50:30,482 --> 02:50:32,583
[SPEAKER_04]: The one day of the year he actually gets to chew gum.

2480
02:50:32,923 --> 02:50:35,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, any other thoughts for the listeners before I let you go?

2481
02:50:37,745 --> 02:50:41,967
[SPEAKER_00]: No, just happy holidays you guys and keep on listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2482
02:50:41,987 --> 02:50:43,288
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this show.

2483
02:50:43,388 --> 02:50:45,289
[SPEAKER_04]: We will keep listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2484
02:50:45,349 --> 02:50:45,769
[SPEAKER_04]: You too.

2485
02:50:45,929 --> 02:50:49,390
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't listen to a damn thing anybody else on this show says.

2486
02:50:49,951 --> 02:50:50,651
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, what's that?

2487
02:50:51,917 --> 02:50:56,100
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so the listeners, not the people who keep putting it out there, of course.

2488
02:50:56,220 --> 02:50:57,762
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are the hosts.

2489
02:50:58,042 --> 02:50:59,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine, I'll stop listening.

2490
02:50:59,683 --> 02:51:01,965
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, fuck those guys.

2491
02:51:02,625 --> 02:51:04,107
[SPEAKER_04]: We really appreciate it, Duke Newcomb.

2492
02:51:04,367 --> 02:51:05,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for the question and take care.

2493
02:51:06,977 --> 02:51:07,637
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, take care

2494
02:51:23,542 --> 02:51:24,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Patch Update 1.5

2495
02:51:46,243 --> 02:51:55,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, they're saying variable signal strength stuff, as well as some additions to the minecarts, ways to link minecarts together.

2496
02:51:56,288 --> 02:52:01,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, they're saying they're going to have a special block that's going to allow people to dump off cargo.

2497
02:52:01,810 --> 02:52:09,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like a lot of stuff they were kind of inspired by Tekkit, where they're going to have piping systems for you moving stuff to chests and that kind of thing.

2498
02:52:11,035 --> 02:52:11,475
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty cool.

2499
02:52:11,535 --> 02:52:16,698
[SPEAKER_03]: And also some new nether-based ore that I guess will be used to make capacitors.

2500
02:52:16,838 --> 02:52:19,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let me hold that thought while we go to the phones.

2501
02:52:19,239 --> 02:52:20,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2502
02:52:20,219 --> 02:52:20,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2503
02:52:23,181 --> 02:52:24,821
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the dead call again.

2504
02:52:25,622 --> 02:52:26,222
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you're muted.

2505
02:52:26,262 --> 02:52:26,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

2506
02:52:27,383 --> 02:52:27,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

2507
02:52:28,903 --> 02:52:29,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

2508
02:52:30,324 --> 02:52:30,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Goodbye.

2509
02:52:31,425 --> 02:52:32,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's try another one here.

2510
02:52:33,206 --> 02:52:34,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2511
02:52:34,206 --> 02:52:34,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

2512
02:52:35,227 --> 02:52:36,327
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one and only Ranma.

2513
02:52:36,487 --> 02:52:36,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Ranma.

2514
02:52:37,027 --> 02:52:37,848
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a good Ranma!

2515
02:52:41,455 --> 02:52:42,396
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing, Ranma?

2516
02:52:43,836 --> 02:52:47,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Alive, awake, stuffed, and full.

2517
02:52:48,157 --> 02:52:48,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Full of what?

2518
02:52:50,177 --> 02:52:53,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, Thanksgiving dinner.

2519
02:52:53,878 --> 02:52:55,558
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your favorite Thanksgiving meal?

2520
02:52:56,078 --> 02:52:57,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Thanksgiving dish?

2521
02:52:58,278 --> 02:53:00,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet potato pie.

2522
02:53:00,219 --> 02:53:01,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet potatoes.

2523
02:53:01,239 --> 02:53:01,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, lovely.

2524
02:53:02,219 --> 02:53:02,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet potatoes.

2525
02:53:03,199 --> 02:53:05,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Our Friendsgiving had mashed sweet potatoes.

2526
02:53:06,120 --> 02:53:06,640
[SPEAKER_11]: Good stuff.

2527
02:53:08,993 --> 02:53:09,793
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's on your mind, buddy?

2528
02:53:09,993 --> 02:53:10,494
[SPEAKER_06]: Why'd you call?

2529
02:53:11,154 --> 02:53:17,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, first off, in response about talking about eating Oreos earlier, I can't eat one.

2530
02:53:17,657 --> 02:53:18,797
[SPEAKER_06]: It's considered cannibalism.

2531
02:53:19,177 --> 02:53:21,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not repeat the joke you made in chat.

2532
02:53:21,998 --> 02:53:23,199
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want an explicit tag this week.

2533
02:53:23,219 --> 02:53:24,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Leave me just like that.

2534
02:53:25,500 --> 02:53:25,900
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2535
02:53:28,101 --> 02:53:30,122
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, this is a PG-13 podcast.

2536
02:53:30,222 --> 02:53:31,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes, exactly.

2537
02:53:31,342 --> 02:53:32,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what else is on your mind?

2538
02:53:32,182 --> 02:53:34,523
[SPEAKER_10]: However, I'll allow you to say it if you get me that $65 Garris figure.

2539
02:53:37,025 --> 02:53:37,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't listen to her.

2540
02:53:38,566 --> 02:53:42,048
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to talk to my accountant right now, so yeah.

2541
02:53:43,689 --> 02:53:45,750
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's going on in your gaming world, Ranma?

2542
02:53:48,152 --> 02:53:48,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Not too much.

2543
02:53:50,513 --> 02:54:04,182
[SPEAKER_06]: The only game I've been doing has been on my tablet, and I was checking eBay on Saturday, and I'm like, wow, I really kind of feel bad for those people who stood on those long lines to grab a Wii U just to flip it, because you know what?

2544
02:54:04,702 --> 02:54:05,863
[SPEAKER_06]: That was going to be me.

2545
02:54:08,438 --> 02:54:10,520
[SPEAKER_04]: I ain't got pity in the world for those people.

2546
02:54:10,620 --> 02:54:16,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you had done it yourself, Ranma, I would have said, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

2547
02:54:17,807 --> 02:54:18,287
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Ranma.

2548
02:54:19,008 --> 02:54:19,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

2549
02:54:19,348 --> 02:54:19,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha.

2550
02:54:21,571 --> 02:54:23,733
[SPEAKER_06]: The most expensive one I saw was $405 with 70 bids.

2551
02:54:28,191 --> 02:54:28,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

2552
02:54:28,531 --> 02:54:36,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, you know, it's just either people are resisting or it's just it's not that hard to come by right now.

2553
02:54:36,641 --> 02:54:43,108
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you can still find basics on shelves in some places and some people are just saying, you know what, I'd rather buy a basic than buy from an eBay flipper.

2554
02:54:44,019 --> 02:54:44,399
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

2555
02:54:44,719 --> 02:54:49,482
[SPEAKER_06]: And I remember during the whole Wii U sales, they were going as high as $2,500, $3,000.

2556
02:54:51,763 --> 02:55:02,009
[SPEAKER_06]: And I saw ads where you would get Wii, all the released games, 5.1 surround sound system, 50-inch LCD TV.

2557
02:55:02,289 --> 02:55:07,012
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll dress up as Santa and bring it to your house and deliver it for your kids on Christmas Day.

2558
02:55:07,992 --> 02:55:08,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Good Lord.

2559
02:55:09,113 --> 02:55:10,194
[SPEAKER_04]: How much did that go for?

2560
02:55:10,916 --> 02:55:11,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are going as high as $3,000.

2561
02:55:11,997 --> 02:55:15,520
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a bad deal for all that shit.

2562
02:55:16,981 --> 02:55:24,388
[SPEAKER_04]: I expect to see something like that around the holidays for the Wii U. Ranma, will you dress up as Santa and come over to my house and give out the presents?

2563
02:55:25,048 --> 02:55:26,249
[SPEAKER_12]: Does it come with full release?

2564
02:55:29,933 --> 02:55:30,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

2565
02:55:32,255 --> 02:55:34,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Does my visit from Santa come with a happy ending?

2566
02:55:37,907 --> 02:55:40,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, that was bad and you should feel bad.

2567
02:55:41,008 --> 02:55:41,448
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.

2568
02:55:42,488 --> 02:55:44,268
[SPEAKER_06]: It ain't Black Santa, it's Mary Kwanzaa, fool!

2569
02:55:48,529 --> 02:55:49,989
[SPEAKER_10]: I pity you through the dual light candles.

2570
02:55:51,949 --> 02:55:52,370
[SPEAKER_06]: How's that?

2571
02:55:53,510 --> 02:55:54,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Close enough.

2572
02:55:54,090 --> 02:55:56,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Time for me to wear my Mary Kwanzaa bitch's shirt again.

2573
02:55:56,690 --> 02:56:00,151
[SPEAKER_04]: How about I send you over to Jamie's house on Christmas because that would be hilarious.

2574
02:56:02,111 --> 02:56:06,632
[SPEAKER_06]: If you send me to Jamie's house for Christmas, I might not leave because you know she has that southern cooking I love.

2575
02:56:07,968 --> 02:56:09,109
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I can do it too.

2576
02:56:10,550 --> 02:56:13,732
[SPEAKER_10]: I will make grits and mashed potatoes.

2577
02:56:15,854 --> 02:56:17,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Grits and mashed potatoes!

2578
02:56:17,995 --> 02:56:28,363
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to totally advertise this to all the listeners everywhere, but Alan and I have been talking about starting a new Christmas tradition out of the one we started last year.

2579
02:56:28,783 --> 02:56:31,005
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is taking our Jewish friends...

2580
02:56:31,505 --> 02:56:33,566
[SPEAKER_04]: to Asian food on Christmas.

2581
02:56:33,747 --> 02:56:34,207
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

2582
02:56:34,247 --> 02:56:34,807
[SPEAKER_10]: We did that.

2583
02:56:34,827 --> 02:56:35,388
[SPEAKER_04]: We did that last year.

2584
02:56:35,648 --> 02:56:36,989
[SPEAKER_10]: We went out for pho, didn't we?

2585
02:56:37,009 --> 02:56:37,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we did.

2586
02:56:37,589 --> 02:56:39,831
[SPEAKER_04]: So Alan and I want to extend that again this year.

2587
02:56:39,851 --> 02:56:41,171
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm down for that.

2588
02:56:41,312 --> 02:56:42,933
[SPEAKER_04]: We might try to get some other people to come along this year.

2589
02:56:42,953 --> 02:56:44,754
[SPEAKER_10]: We even sort of made a half joke.

2590
02:56:45,654 --> 02:56:50,117
[SPEAKER_10]: Two gay men and a Jew walk into a Vietnamese restaurant.

2591
02:56:50,137 --> 02:56:51,238
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a new sitcom.

2592
02:56:51,398 --> 02:56:53,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Two gay men and a Jew at a Vietnamese restaurant.

2593
02:56:53,700 --> 02:56:56,241
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know the punchline, but there's one in there somewhere.

2594
02:56:57,182 --> 02:57:01,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Jumas has been a long-time tradition in my house for the last seven years.

2595
02:57:01,745 --> 02:57:02,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Chris McQuanzica.

2596
02:57:03,486 --> 02:57:04,187
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

2597
02:57:04,307 --> 02:57:04,787
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

2598
02:57:05,167 --> 02:57:05,888
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Ranma.

2599
02:57:05,988 --> 02:57:07,549
[SPEAKER_10]: I was calling it Holiday Mass.

2600
02:57:07,829 --> 02:57:09,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Merry Festivus to you.

2601
02:57:09,570 --> 02:57:13,132
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for the rest of us.

2602
02:57:13,212 --> 02:57:14,914
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's nothing else, then I'm going to let you go.

2603
02:57:15,754 --> 02:57:16,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Works for me.

2604
02:57:16,495 --> 02:57:17,155
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, take care, buddy.

2605
02:57:17,695 --> 02:57:17,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

2606
02:57:18,116 --> 02:57:18,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

2607
02:57:19,477 --> 02:57:21,378
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you guys, the Oreo joke was really bad.

2608
02:57:21,778 --> 02:57:22,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line.

2609
02:57:22,958 --> 02:57:25,319
[SPEAKER_04]: We're running way over three hours tonight, so I'm going to wrap it up.

2610
02:57:25,359 --> 02:57:28,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to those that didn't get through, but if you didn't get through, you should send us an email.

2611
02:57:28,840 --> 02:57:34,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Or you can always send us a tweet or any of that stuff.

2612
02:57:35,143 --> 02:57:37,083
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to let Loki finish up the last minute stories.

2613
02:57:37,764 --> 02:57:38,964
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to get to Twitter topics too.

2614
02:57:39,524 --> 02:57:44,188
[SPEAKER_03]: One last thing, there was another app that was announced called Minecraft Reality.

2615
02:57:44,648 --> 02:57:53,015
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an augmented reality app for iOS, and it can display 3D Minecraft images in the real world, and you can walk around them and stuff.

2616
02:57:53,536 --> 02:57:55,617
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looked pretty cool from the little trailer that they had.

2617
02:57:56,238 --> 02:57:57,859
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can check that out.

2618
02:57:57,999 --> 02:58:00,341
[SPEAKER_03]: It's $2 to download.

2619
02:58:03,217 --> 02:58:07,099
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually have a last minute story because this just finished while we were doing the show tonight.

2620
02:58:07,139 --> 02:58:11,540
[SPEAKER_04]: The Kickstarter for the Shadowgate reboot has ended and they made it.

2621
02:58:12,201 --> 02:58:15,062
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Shadowgate reimagining is going to be happening.

2622
02:58:15,642 --> 02:58:16,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Which one?

2623
02:58:18,851 --> 02:58:27,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Shadowgate Shadowrun The old school NES game and Mac game Deja Vu, etc.

2624
02:58:27,473 --> 02:58:44,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only did they make their $120,000 for the base game, but they made their first stretch goal of $130,000 meaning they're going to expand on the castle and add some rooms and puzzles 15% more game So, pretty cool Congratulations to the team there who make Shadowgate

2625
02:58:46,277 --> 02:58:47,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to the Twitter topics.

2626
02:58:48,318 --> 02:58:50,119
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really excited about that Shadowgate reboot, though.

2627
02:58:50,239 --> 02:58:53,120
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually, that's only the second Kickstarter I've ever given to.

2628
02:58:53,221 --> 02:58:55,002
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've done GamerCon, and I did that one.

2629
02:58:55,962 --> 02:58:56,622
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see.

2630
02:58:57,543 --> 02:59:05,788
[SPEAKER_04]: There's part of me that wants to give to the Molyneux project, but then I'm like, that guy is such a... The advertisement, again, really, really turned me off a little bit.

2631
02:59:06,568 --> 02:59:06,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

2632
02:59:08,289 --> 02:59:08,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

2633
02:59:08,889 --> 02:59:11,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to some tweets.

2634
02:59:13,650 --> 02:59:14,870
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

2635
02:59:15,270 --> 02:59:20,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft wants to remind us the Gold Nunchuck will make its return to Club Nintendo tomorrow.

2636
02:59:20,792 --> 02:59:23,532
[SPEAKER_04]: 900 points for the Golden Nunchuck because they need to get rid of him.

2637
02:59:24,633 --> 02:59:26,093
[SPEAKER_10]: I really need this in my life, Rob.

2638
02:59:26,393 --> 02:59:27,093
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't understand.

2639
02:59:27,153 --> 02:59:27,973
[SPEAKER_04]: What, the Golden Nunchuck?

2640
02:59:28,133 --> 02:59:28,334
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

2641
02:59:28,554 --> 02:59:29,874
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

2642
02:59:30,594 --> 02:59:34,155
[SPEAKER_10]: The Garrus figure that's... A Zekstal?

2643
02:59:37,077 --> 02:59:37,517
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what?

2644
02:59:37,817 --> 02:59:38,437
[SPEAKER_03]: A sex doll.

2645
02:59:38,898 --> 02:59:39,218
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

2646
02:59:40,478 --> 02:59:43,500
[SPEAKER_10]: It's someone linked it to me for cheaper.

2647
02:59:47,141 --> 02:59:47,562
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2648
02:59:47,842 --> 02:59:48,922
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's see.

2649
02:59:49,042 --> 02:59:53,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on to the next tweet from Tiger Claw.

2650
02:59:53,825 --> 02:59:54,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I did read about this.

2651
02:59:56,326 --> 03:00:00,287
[SPEAKER_04]: 007 Legends Studio Eurocom laid off a big chunk of its staff this week.

2652
03:00:01,028 --> 03:00:03,229
[SPEAKER_04]: And he links us to a story I'm trying to bring up right now.

2653
03:00:04,910 --> 03:00:12,077
[SPEAKER_04]: The Eurocom Studio, which is based in the UK, laid off the majority of its workforce as part of restructuring.

2654
03:00:12,377 --> 03:00:13,558
[SPEAKER_04]: The studio has been around since 88.

2655
03:00:13,978 --> 03:00:16,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they made a lot of games besides just this.

2656
03:00:16,561 --> 03:00:22,146
[SPEAKER_04]: They also did 007 Reloaded and then, of course, Legends, which wasn't very well received, unfortunately.

2657
03:00:23,066 --> 03:00:31,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Eurocom director Hugh Binns said that, quote, Eurocom are undertaking a restructuring which I regret to say has meant we've made the majority of our workforce redundant today.

2658
03:00:31,848 --> 03:00:33,348
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the British word for laying off.

2659
03:00:34,369 --> 03:00:41,290
[SPEAKER_04]: This includes many very experienced, talented, and highly skilled employees, and we'd like to thank them all for your hard work and efforts.

2660
03:00:41,790 --> 03:00:44,511
[SPEAKER_04]: And they say this is because of the decline in the video game market.

2661
03:00:45,271 --> 03:00:47,192
[SPEAKER_04]: The studio had to cancel a number of projects.

2662
03:00:47,992 --> 03:00:49,072
[SPEAKER_04]: That sucks.

2663
03:00:50,714 --> 03:00:58,437
[SPEAKER_04]: And lastly, SSJ100 Matt sends us this tweet about, we all know playing games while driving is a terrible idea, but one game is trying to change that.

2664
03:01:00,918 --> 03:01:01,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Bright Driver.

2665
03:01:02,822 --> 03:01:03,462
[SPEAKER_04]: is what it's called.

2666
03:01:03,522 --> 03:01:05,203
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an iPhone app called Bright Driver.

2667
03:01:05,303 --> 03:01:12,706
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a platform that supports audio games people play in the car to keep their attention from lagging during long rides.

2668
03:01:13,206 --> 03:01:23,949
[SPEAKER_04]: It uses GPS functionality to keep track of the user's driving using metrics like speed, break rate, and stressful conditions like traffic and the games modify their pace appropriately.

2669
03:01:24,370 --> 03:01:25,470
[SPEAKER_04]: That is crazy.

2670
03:01:26,430 --> 03:01:27,271
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of cool.

2671
03:01:27,751 --> 03:01:29,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Like an audio game that you interact with.

2672
03:01:30,552 --> 03:01:30,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

2673
03:01:31,372 --> 03:01:32,432
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to hear more about this.

2674
03:01:32,452 --> 03:01:35,353
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to read the rest of the story for a future week, but that sounds kind of cool.

2675
03:01:36,614 --> 03:01:40,315
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's it for the tweets tonight at twitter.com slash OLR.

2676
03:01:40,715 --> 03:01:43,856
[SPEAKER_04]: And this means we're at the end of the show.

2677
03:01:44,656 --> 03:01:44,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw.

2678
03:01:45,997 --> 03:01:48,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Rachel, thank you very much for coming to the show tonight.

2679
03:01:48,778 --> 03:01:49,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for having me.

2680
03:01:49,558 --> 03:01:50,118
[SPEAKER_04]: And sitting in.

2681
03:01:50,158 --> 03:01:50,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Come back anytime.

2682
03:01:51,579 --> 03:01:52,099
[SPEAKER_04]: I surely will.

2683
03:01:52,359 --> 03:01:54,060
[SPEAKER_04]: and we'll talk to you again.

2684
03:01:55,240 --> 03:01:59,803
[SPEAKER_04]: It may have taken you 480 episodes to get here but it doesn't look like we're going to go anywhere anytime soon.

2685
03:01:59,843 --> 03:02:02,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Duke Nukem told us we need to keep listening so I guess we're here for a little while.

2686
03:02:03,945 --> 03:02:05,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

2687
03:02:10,548 --> 03:02:11,588
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

2688
03:02:11,788 --> 03:02:12,189
[SPEAKER_12]: Quick plug?

2689
03:02:12,629 --> 03:02:13,189
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, of course.

2690
03:02:13,409 --> 03:02:14,990
[SPEAKER_12]: Greetings from the wasteland at WordPress.

2691
03:02:15,210 --> 03:02:19,052
[SPEAKER_12]: I do creepypasta and I do write about video games occasionally.

2692
03:02:19,397 --> 03:02:19,697
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

2693
03:02:37,506 --> 03:02:39,226
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone really needs to get me the Garrus figure.

2694
03:02:39,406 --> 03:02:40,367
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not even kidding.

2695
03:02:40,887 --> 03:02:43,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Does it come with full release?

2696
03:02:43,587 --> 03:02:45,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it come with Tumblr rendered VJ?

2697
03:02:45,848 --> 03:02:46,648
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2698
03:02:47,168 --> 03:02:51,889
[SPEAKER_04]: And my final thought tonight, as always, thank you all for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2699
03:02:52,249 --> 03:02:55,530
[SPEAKER_04]: If you enjoyed the show, please tell a friend or two or 20 about the show.

2700
03:02:55,890 --> 03:02:58,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Help us spread the word because we don't have any major websites behind us.

2701
03:02:59,171 --> 03:03:00,971
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we have the VOG Network, but let's be...

2702
03:03:01,491 --> 03:03:05,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's be real, it's not exactly a oneup.com or a giant bomb.

2703
03:03:05,833 --> 03:03:07,494
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, help spread the word.

2704
03:03:07,514 --> 03:03:08,714
[SPEAKER_03]: A website that generates revenue.

2705
03:03:08,814 --> 03:03:09,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, exactly.

2706
03:03:10,255 --> 03:03:11,215
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fun project.

2707
03:03:11,255 --> 03:03:11,675
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what?

2708
03:03:11,695 --> 03:03:13,996
[SPEAKER_04]: There are more great shows on VOG.

2709
03:03:14,036 --> 03:03:14,857
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not just us.

2710
03:03:15,197 --> 03:03:16,998
[SPEAKER_04]: There are lots and lots of great shows on VOG.

2711
03:03:18,018 --> 03:03:20,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby Blackwolf before us Sunday nights.

2712
03:03:21,099 --> 03:03:22,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Under Station Live on Saturday nights.

2713
03:03:23,420 --> 03:03:26,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Mondays are full of pod culture, British invaders, and critical myth.

2714
03:03:27,222 --> 03:03:30,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Critical Myth, the hardworking guys, they're on three times a week on the network.

2715
03:03:30,963 --> 03:03:32,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Anime Jam Session on Tuesday.

2716
03:03:33,243 --> 03:03:34,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Girls Gone Wow on Wednesday.

2717
03:03:35,164 --> 03:03:36,524
[SPEAKER_04]: And Horde House, they're okay.

2718
03:03:37,084 --> 03:03:38,025
[SPEAKER_04]: Also on Wednesday.

2719
03:03:39,165 --> 03:03:39,785
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

2720
03:03:39,825 --> 03:03:43,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, as Black Wolf says in chat, VOG Network, it's a website.

2721
03:03:45,106 --> 03:03:46,026
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good final thought.

2722
03:03:46,346 --> 03:03:47,087
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a website.

2723
03:03:48,067 --> 03:03:50,727
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you next time on our website.

2724
03:03:51,548 --> 03:03:52,348
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good night, everybody.

2725
03:03:52,768 --> 03:03:53,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

2726
03:03:54,116 --> 03:03:57,138
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2727
03:03:57,778 --> 03:04:02,001
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.

2728
03:04:02,582 --> 03:04:11,448
[SPEAKER_01]: To join us for a live show, tune in to VOGnetwork.com Sunday nights at 6pm Pacific, 9pm Eastern.

2729
03:04:12,088 --> 03:04:23,516
[SPEAKER_01]: The views and opinions expressed in this program do not necessarily reflect those of the staff of Orange Lounge Radio or VOG Network, but you know they were all still true.

2730
03:04:24,516 --> 03:04:25,497
[SPEAKER_01]: See you next week!
