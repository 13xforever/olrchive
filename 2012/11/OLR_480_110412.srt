00:00:14,138 --> 00:00:26,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, November 4th, 2012, Sony reports a loss of close to $200 million, details emerge on Nintendo Network Premium, and one vice president of a retail gaming company pleads guilty to embezzlement.

2
00:00:32,185 --> 00:00:36,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:43,912
[SPEAKER_06]: It is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 480 for this November the 4th of 2012.

4
00:00:45,493 --> 00:00:49,055
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope for those of you guys that go out and do stuff on Halloween, you had a good Halloween.

5
00:00:49,855 --> 00:00:55,259
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can't believe it, but now is that time of year where we start seeing all the Christmas stuff show up in stores and all that...

6
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,963
[SPEAKER_06]: and I'm sure wanting to comment on that is the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

7
00:01:02,063 --> 00:01:06,186
[SPEAKER_02]: I still haven't seen any Hanukkah stuff and Hanukkah is like two weeks before Christmas.

8
00:01:07,547 --> 00:01:08,667
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, it's not fair.

9
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:12,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it's, it's...

10
00:01:14,937 --> 00:01:17,079
[SPEAKER_02]: Bigotry, it's bigotry, it's prejudice.

11
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,823
[SPEAKER_06]: To be fair, I haven't seen any Festivus polls, so they're hating on Festivus too.

12
00:01:24,404 --> 00:01:24,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

13
00:01:26,366 --> 00:01:30,989
[SPEAKER_02]: I just saw a funny thing in chat, so I'm not going to say it because I'm not talking about politics.

14
00:01:31,309 --> 00:01:31,709
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

15
00:01:32,149 --> 00:01:32,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank gosh.

16
00:01:32,849 --> 00:01:33,130
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

17
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Also say hello to Tech Master Loki.

18
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:36,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

19
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,011
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you, Loki?

20
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:37,551
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm fine.

21
00:01:38,251 --> 00:01:38,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

22
00:01:39,231 --> 00:01:39,951
[SPEAKER_06]: What's new with you?

23
00:01:39,971 --> 00:01:41,512
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your week?

24
00:01:42,132 --> 00:01:43,172
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been all right.

25
00:01:43,352 --> 00:01:44,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of Minecraft.

26
00:01:44,553 --> 00:01:45,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of Minecraft.

27
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:51,115
[SPEAKER_06]: You were showing me... Okay, tell me about this little thing you were... This was cool, this map thing you were showing me before the show.

28
00:01:51,415 --> 00:01:52,115
[SPEAKER_06]: How does that work?

29
00:01:52,455 --> 00:01:53,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Dynamic Map or Dynemap

30
00:02:20,336 --> 00:02:39,257
[SPEAKER_07]: and basically it's almost in real time there's a little bit of there's some glitches like I've noticed a few blocks not updating but it's pretty much in real time and it shows just everything that's on the server you can take a peek and see what people are building and just kind of how things look

31
00:02:40,543 --> 00:02:43,886
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe get you interested in joining up on the server because it's fun.

32
00:02:45,046 --> 00:02:45,947
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've got that.

33
00:02:46,187 --> 00:02:47,849
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, check it out.

34
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:51,912
[SPEAKER_07]: You can even see when people are playing, you can see them moving around and where they're at and stuff like that.

35
00:02:52,652 --> 00:02:53,193
[SPEAKER_07]: You can watch chat.

36
00:02:53,253 --> 00:02:54,994
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of fun.

37
00:02:55,427 --> 00:03:11,612
[SPEAKER_06]: that's kind of neat that you can do that all live and I like being able to see kind of the like just isometric view and I even found my house on there you helped but I was able to find the house and all that yeah I haven't gotten around to labeling everything yet like some people's places I don't know who built them you know I know I was like Loki what's that

38
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:12,152
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

39
00:03:12,232 --> 00:03:12,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, what's that?

40
00:03:13,132 --> 00:03:14,573
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

41
00:03:14,753 --> 00:03:15,533
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen that there.

42
00:03:15,573 --> 00:03:16,213
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't remember.

43
00:03:16,514 --> 00:03:32,839
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was one time I did see who built it, but I don't remember who it was because they were standing there idling and I just didn't remember because some people are not responsible enough to label their houses with signs so I know who's building what.

44
00:03:33,099 --> 00:03:35,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Your roller coaster is epic too, by the way.

45
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,300
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty large.

46
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,880
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't ridden it yet.

47
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,541
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still not going to play it until someone buys it for me.

48
00:03:40,382 --> 00:03:46,007
[SPEAKER_06]: What she's not going to tell you is that when she saw the map and was looking at everything, she was like, okay, maybe I do need to play this.

49
00:03:47,748 --> 00:03:50,030
[SPEAKER_06]: She's starting to turn around a little bit.

50
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,311
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki's magic is working a little bit.

51
00:03:51,391 --> 00:03:52,732
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to put my foot down.

52
00:03:52,772 --> 00:03:54,393
[SPEAKER_02]: When someone buys it for me, then I'll play it.

53
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:57,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe Hanukkah Harry will bring you a copy.

54
00:03:58,777 --> 00:03:59,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather have the N7 hoodie

55
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:13,646
[SPEAKER_06]: What stopped you from going?

56
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,247
[SPEAKER_06]: You see all the big new movies.

57
00:04:15,687 --> 00:04:16,768
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't, actually.

58
00:04:16,888 --> 00:04:17,728
[SPEAKER_07]: You usually do.

59
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:20,070
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to before I had a kid.

60
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,971
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, this is a kid's movie, sort of.

61
00:04:23,111 --> 00:04:25,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I just didn't get a chance to go see it.

62
00:04:25,613 --> 00:04:29,815
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I still want to see it, but it's just I haven't gotten to go see it yet.

63
00:04:30,046 --> 00:04:30,486
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

64
00:04:55,182 --> 00:04:58,724
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to note, even though it looked like a Pixar movie, it was not a Pixar movie.

65
00:04:58,884 --> 00:05:09,409
[SPEAKER_06]: So it did not beat all the Pixar movies, but it did beat all of the Disney classics, which includes Tangled, which was also kind of that same animation style, if you saw that movie.

66
00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:11,951
[SPEAKER_06]: But it made $49.1 million, at least that's the estimate.

67
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:14,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the interesting thing is they are crediting...

68
00:05:14,992 --> 00:05:44,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Hurricane Sandy for some of the reason why it did so well because a lot of kids didn't have school on Friday a lot of people wanted to just get away you know out of the nightmare they've been living the past week and go see a movie so they're actually saying it was part of the reason it had a little bit of a boost but I don't know I mean I just know a lot of people that I know were really interested in seeing this movie and it really did seem like the type of thing that was geared at families as well as you know

69
00:05:44,938 --> 00:05:46,339
[SPEAKER_02]: It had the classic stuff.

70
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,480
[SPEAKER_02]: The classic stuff was great.

71
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,041
[SPEAKER_02]: The references, if you caught them.

72
00:05:50,962 --> 00:05:51,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to go see it again.

73
00:05:52,983 --> 00:05:54,864
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to try to phrase this without spoiling it.

74
00:05:54,924 --> 00:05:56,545
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw it too and I had a great time.

75
00:05:56,825 --> 00:06:03,449
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the great thing about it is that, well, obviously I like two things and we talk about it a lot on this show.

76
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,830
[SPEAKER_06]: Video games and Disney.

77
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,671
[SPEAKER_06]: And this movie was really both.

78
00:06:07,331 --> 00:06:13,575
[SPEAKER_06]: But the neat thing about it is that it wasn't really about the video games.

79
00:06:15,086 --> 00:06:16,507
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

80
00:06:36,983 --> 00:07:02,741
[SPEAKER_06]: so I kind of think it was neat that it was this very traditional Disney story and for all practical purposes it was pretty formulaic for the rest of Disney movies not that that's a bad thing but you know it was it was it was kind of what you'd expect from a Disney movie but it took place in this universe that coexists alongside Street Fighter, Q-Bert, you know Sega games all these other things what did you think about them going to the Tapper?

81
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:04,603
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I thought that was great.

82
00:07:04,643 --> 00:07:07,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there was a scene where- I thought about you when I saw that.

83
00:07:07,745 --> 00:07:08,785
[SPEAKER_06]: Where they referenced Tapper.

84
00:07:09,005 --> 00:07:11,686
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of my friends sitting next to me was like, is Tapper a real game?

85
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:13,867
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, oh my God, how old are you?

86
00:07:14,107 --> 00:07:15,968
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I'm way older than you.

87
00:07:16,068 --> 00:07:17,989
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember Tapper when it was in the arcades.

88
00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:22,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan completely jumped at the, and I'm not going to say any more than this, the Road Blasters.

89
00:07:23,331 --> 00:07:24,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

90
00:07:24,793 --> 00:07:26,674
[SPEAKER_02]: A, Stay Till the Very, Very, Very End of the Credits

91
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,381
[SPEAKER_06]: for a little, you know, like most movies.

92
00:07:50,621 --> 00:07:54,682
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a big thing, but it's one of those things that when you see it, you'll be like, oh, that's clever.

93
00:07:54,782 --> 00:07:55,242
[SPEAKER_06]: That's funny.

94
00:07:55,522 --> 00:07:55,802
[SPEAKER_06]: LOL.

95
00:07:56,763 --> 00:08:01,304
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also, crap, what else was I going to say?

96
00:08:01,884 --> 00:08:02,144
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

97
00:08:02,164 --> 00:08:02,644
[SPEAKER_02]: The graffiti.

98
00:08:02,985 --> 00:08:03,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, the graffiti.

99
00:08:03,865 --> 00:08:05,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep an eye out for the various graffiti.

100
00:08:05,065 --> 00:08:07,646
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many little jokes on the side.

101
00:08:08,246 --> 00:08:14,268
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually, you can see Princess Peach and Princess Toadstool are like totally in the movie, but they're like in the background.

102
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:15,690
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's them.

103
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:16,431
[SPEAKER_06]: It's totally them.

104
00:08:16,471 --> 00:08:21,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there was the one scene with Chun-Li walking with the two princesses, but neither of them were...

105
00:08:23,186 --> 00:08:23,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Peach or Toadstool.

106
00:08:23,766 --> 00:08:24,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of them was Peach.

107
00:08:24,826 --> 00:08:26,047
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them was in blue.

108
00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:27,127
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one was Daisy.

109
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:28,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, probably Pauline.

110
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:28,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

111
00:08:29,428 --> 00:08:29,888
[SPEAKER_02]: And Pauline.

112
00:08:30,388 --> 00:08:32,048
[SPEAKER_06]: So, very interesting.

113
00:08:32,568 --> 00:08:33,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to our chat room.

114
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:38,050
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm being a very bad boy and I did not introduce our chat yet, but we do love our live chatters.

115
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,250
[SPEAKER_06]: We love the podcast listeners.

116
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:45,632
[SPEAKER_06]: We also love the people that join us live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network or vognetwork.com.

117
00:08:45,932 --> 00:08:51,053
[SPEAKER_06]: We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

118
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:59,838
[SPEAKER_06]: and we have a live chat room that you can chat along with us at live.vognetwork.com and GameGuru in chat says it was Daisy and Rosalina.

119
00:08:59,918 --> 00:09:00,698
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the name.

120
00:09:00,718 --> 00:09:01,519
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't think of her name.

121
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:02,659
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Rosalina.

122
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:03,580
[SPEAKER_02]: From Galaxy.

123
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Pauline was Donkey Kong.

124
00:09:05,621 --> 00:09:09,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Pauline was Donkey Kong but I thought they retroactively made her a princess or something.

125
00:09:09,904 --> 00:09:11,424
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so.

126
00:09:11,444 --> 00:09:12,305
[SPEAKER_06]: She was wearing pink.

127
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:16,527
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the same thing where everybody's like, oh, Leia's a Disney princess now.

128
00:09:16,627 --> 00:09:17,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Leia's a Disney princess.

129
00:09:18,048 --> 00:09:19,109
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think that that's funny.

130
00:09:19,369 --> 00:09:19,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.

131
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Put the brakes on that chat.

132
00:09:21,451 --> 00:09:22,392
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get there in a minute.

133
00:09:23,593 --> 00:09:25,595
[SPEAKER_06]: But meanwhile, let's see.

134
00:09:25,675 --> 00:09:28,717
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan Shadow in our chat room says, I hate end credits crap.

135
00:09:29,718 --> 00:09:30,960
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate end credits crap.

136
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you hate end credits crap?

137
00:09:32,981 --> 00:09:33,262
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

138
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:33,822
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

139
00:09:35,063 --> 00:09:37,565
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually make a habit of saying through the credits regardless.

140
00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:49,427
[SPEAKER_02]: because I think that a lot of people behind the scenes put a lot of hard work in the movie and that's sort of my nod to them and I hear good music I check the soundtrack listings I downloaded the soundtrack in the theater

141
00:09:52,453 --> 00:10:15,348
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a roommate in college that was very much like you where it was like whenever we would go to see the movies he's like nope we're not leaving till after the credits is over and it was nothing about bonus scenes or anything like that it was just no we're gonna watch the entire movie and I was like all right I guess everybody's got their thing you don't want it you don't want to get the jump on getting out of here get the parking lot all right all right we'll stay and watch credits it's fine so I think that's that's fine though

142
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:20,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, what else did I... Let's see, some people talking about The Wizard.

143
00:10:20,731 --> 00:10:25,573
[SPEAKER_06]: Ragenator says, so Wreck-It Ralph was about as much about video games as The Wizard was then?

144
00:10:26,514 --> 00:10:28,535
[SPEAKER_06]: In a funny way, yes.

145
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:39,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I kind of don't like acknowledging that that reference works because The Wizard was a very different type of movie and for all practical purposes, let's be real, it wasn't a very good movie.

146
00:10:41,002 --> 00:10:48,988
[SPEAKER_06]: We just... We remember it being awesome because we were kids and it had that look at Super Mario 3 and, you know, the Power Glove.

147
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:49,769
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so bad.

148
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:52,591
[SPEAKER_06]: And all that, like, commercial shit that's, like, you know, shoved down your throat.

149
00:10:53,212 --> 00:10:54,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Wreck-It Ralph didn't really have that.

150
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:56,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, Wreck-It Ralph wasn't... The Wii, it wiggles.

151
00:10:56,815 --> 00:10:57,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

152
00:10:57,455 --> 00:11:00,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I did see a Wii U commercial in the theater before the movie.

153
00:11:00,496 --> 00:11:02,037
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only time I've seen a Wii U commercial.

154
00:11:02,357 --> 00:11:03,557
[SPEAKER_06]: They only have one.

155
00:11:03,757 --> 00:11:07,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody was asking on Twitter today, like, why are there not Wii U commercials on TV and all this stuff?

156
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:08,819
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I saw one in the movie theater.

157
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Putting it before Wreck-It Ralph seems like a nice place to do it.

158
00:11:12,021 --> 00:11:12,541
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

159
00:11:12,581 --> 00:11:22,305
[SPEAKER_02]: They did this thing for Cartoon Network live TV shows, and my husband was like, I miss that commercial that ran for five years with What's-Her-Face.

160
00:11:22,985 --> 00:11:23,425
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it?

161
00:11:23,585 --> 00:11:25,246
[SPEAKER_02]: The Closer or something?

162
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:25,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

163
00:11:26,946 --> 00:11:56,166
[SPEAKER_06]: but then they showed the Ultimate Geek trailer because you know how lately I don't know if every theater in America does this but at least all the ones around here do they have that thing called the Fathom Events where it's like the Metropolitan Night at the Opera or I think Riff Trax does their stuff through Fathom Events but here's the big thing they're doing at the end of November they're doing two episodes of Star Trek The Next Generation in HD people cheered and everybody in the theater cheered and we're like because it's geeks show us when it's DS9 bitches

164
00:11:59,207 --> 00:12:01,449
[SPEAKER_06]: But just for the record, I still want to go to that.

165
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:02,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Just saying.

166
00:12:02,229 --> 00:12:06,532
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to make plans November 29th because I love Star Trek The Next Generation.

167
00:12:07,213 --> 00:12:08,053
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

168
00:12:08,734 --> 00:12:08,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

169
00:12:10,154 --> 00:12:11,655
[SPEAKER_06]: What else did I want to say about the movie?

170
00:12:11,735 --> 00:12:12,076
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

171
00:12:12,556 --> 00:12:14,557
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked it quite a bit.

172
00:12:14,737 --> 00:12:22,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, it's not like shoving the video games in your face, but I'm really glad that this part of pop culture is just –

173
00:12:23,823 --> 00:12:27,464
[SPEAKER_06]: It's there and it's being acknowledged without it being niche.

174
00:12:27,884 --> 00:12:34,545
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's really cool now that I think there's a lot of parents out there who remember a lot of these games from when they were younger.

175
00:12:35,205 --> 00:12:37,706
[SPEAKER_07]: And now we need a TV series, right?

176
00:12:38,566 --> 00:12:41,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it will be interesting to see if the movie continues to do well.

177
00:12:41,487 --> 00:12:44,527
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard it had a very large budget, so it has a lot of money to make up.

178
00:12:44,968 --> 00:12:51,469
[SPEAKER_06]: But if the movie does well, which if it's had a bigger opening than Tangled and there's really not a lot of competition for the movie coming until Thanksgiving...

179
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:53,670
[SPEAKER_06]: There's still another Tron movie.

180
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hope.

181
00:13:20,496 --> 00:13:20,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hope.

182
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:21,442
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope.

183
00:13:21,624 --> 00:13:22,530
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't doubt the other will do.

184
00:13:22,827 --> 00:13:23,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Star Wars Episode VII Fanboy Reaction

185
00:13:52,816 --> 00:13:57,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Lucas turned around and donated the money to education He's probably just ready to retire He's keeping his Marin properties

186
00:14:19,031 --> 00:14:31,477
[SPEAKER_02]: So the game developing building and his ranch, the Skywalker Ranch, is staying under his property, including everything that's on it, but the company itself.

187
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:37,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he wanted to build a movie theater in Marin County, and all the people with their nose in the air said, Yeah, I want a movie theater.

188
00:14:38,061 --> 00:14:38,682
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

189
00:14:56,585 --> 00:14:59,606
[SPEAKER_06]: How will it possibly be worse than the prequels?

190
00:14:59,746 --> 00:15:03,788
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care if it is Mickey and Goofy, which it won't be.

191
00:15:03,868 --> 00:15:04,648
[SPEAKER_06]: We all know it won't be.

192
00:15:04,748 --> 00:15:06,829
[SPEAKER_06]: How can it possibly be worse than the prequels?

193
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:09,510
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a statement, too, that it's changing the canon from the books.

194
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:13,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I seem to remember... Who reads books nowadays?

195
00:15:14,172 --> 00:15:16,132
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of people that are into those damn Star Wars books.

196
00:15:16,212 --> 00:15:25,256
[SPEAKER_06]: I realize that people want those Star Wars books to be adapted, but I seem to recall around the time the prequels came out, there were many interviews with George Lucas where he said...

197
00:15:25,856 --> 00:15:30,537
[SPEAKER_06]: When he did the first trilogy, he always planned for there to be three trilogies.

198
00:15:31,018 --> 00:15:35,699
[SPEAKER_06]: And the recurring characters that would be in all nine movies would be C-3PO and R2-D2.

199
00:15:35,999 --> 00:15:41,301
[SPEAKER_06]: And there would be a trilogy before the original trilogy, and there would be a trilogy after the original trilogy.

200
00:15:41,901 --> 00:15:46,042
[SPEAKER_06]: And he always said that it was going to be nine movies.

201
00:15:46,122 --> 00:15:49,023
[SPEAKER_06]: But then when he was making the prequels, he was like, you know what?

202
00:15:49,103 --> 00:15:50,984
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think there's going to be anything else after this.

203
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher last year about this.

204
00:16:10,353 --> 00:16:13,454
[SPEAKER_02]: They're way too old to reprise the roles unless it's like way set in the future.

205
00:16:13,634 --> 00:16:21,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, or like they said that Luke Skywalker could be the Obi-Wan Kenobi type of the new movies.

206
00:16:21,437 --> 00:16:22,398
[SPEAKER_06]: And that would make a lot of sense.

207
00:16:22,798 --> 00:16:26,879
[SPEAKER_06]: But the reoccurring characters would be C-3PO and R2-D2 because they're androids.

208
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:27,740
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't die.

209
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,160
[SPEAKER_06]: And that makes a lot of sense.

210
00:16:31,301 --> 00:16:33,102
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm curious enough.

211
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:36,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, sorry, I didn't mean to get on a movie tangent, but...

212
00:16:36,443 --> 00:16:48,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, but the big thing is that if they're gonna... I mean, for them to realistically have those people play the same characters, they're gonna have to change the book canon anyway.

213
00:16:49,489 --> 00:16:54,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, honestly, the book canon was going way too crazy and I couldn't even deal with it, so...

214
00:16:55,571 --> 00:17:21,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Ragenator says how can it be worse this is how episode 7 can be centered around Jar Jar it can't 7 will be after the original trilogy Jar Jar will be dead in fact I want to point this out if you think that Disney's gonna fuck up Star Wars you need to go ride the new Star Tours ride because the best ending on that's because you know the Star Wars ride has the multiple endings the best ending is the one where they go to Jar Jar's planet because somebody somebody shoots him

215
00:17:23,223 --> 00:17:26,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Disney shot Jar Jar and you all are pissed?

216
00:17:27,064 --> 00:17:27,644
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, Rob.

217
00:17:27,744 --> 00:17:29,445
[SPEAKER_06]: Your nerd logic doesn't make sense.

218
00:17:29,565 --> 00:17:30,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Let it go.

219
00:17:30,185 --> 00:17:31,605
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, I finally got Hoth.

220
00:17:32,386 --> 00:17:32,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, did you?

221
00:17:32,846 --> 00:17:33,526
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome.

222
00:17:33,546 --> 00:17:34,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it is awesome.

223
00:17:34,606 --> 00:17:35,526
[SPEAKER_06]: The ice planet's the best.

224
00:17:36,447 --> 00:17:38,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, let's see.

225
00:17:40,228 --> 00:17:44,509
[SPEAKER_06]: YYR says, Star Wars Episode 7 begins with the assassination of Jar Jar Binks.

226
00:17:44,569 --> 00:17:45,109
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

227
00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:47,570
[SPEAKER_06]: No, he won't be in it at all.

228
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,750
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just going to look past it.

229
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Gungan lived for hundreds of years.

230
00:17:52,171 --> 00:18:07,288
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100 Matt says just please don't have JJ Abrams direct the next three that would be weird because that's like the crossing the streams thing you don't cross Trek and Wars like I've seen a lot of people campaigning for Zachary Quinto to be a villain in Star Wars

231
00:18:08,209 --> 00:18:08,629
[SPEAKER_06]: He can't.

232
00:18:08,689 --> 00:18:09,630
[SPEAKER_06]: He's locked into Trek.

233
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,071
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just, I think there is this nerd thing.

234
00:18:12,111 --> 00:18:13,671
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't cross Trek in Wars.

235
00:18:13,811 --> 00:18:14,432
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't do it.

236
00:18:14,512 --> 00:18:19,414
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it is completely hilarious to sing Star Trek in line for Star Wars.

237
00:18:19,954 --> 00:18:20,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

238
00:18:21,214 --> 00:18:23,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially when you get the cast member singing along with you.

239
00:18:24,476 --> 00:18:24,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

240
00:18:25,436 --> 00:18:28,637
[SPEAKER_06]: TheRobD says, Han and Leia's kids have a complete story.

241
00:18:28,717 --> 00:18:29,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

242
00:18:29,378 --> 00:18:32,339
[SPEAKER_06]: The books go so far into the future that the story of their kids has been told.

243
00:18:32,939 --> 00:18:34,259
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it would make a lot of sense.

244
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,460
[SPEAKER_06]: I swear we'll get to games.

245
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Luke Skywalker, Han and Leia's kids

246
00:18:51,795 --> 00:18:53,096
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't mean it has to be on the books.

247
00:18:53,116 --> 00:18:54,517
[SPEAKER_06]: The books are not being turned into movies.

248
00:18:54,537 --> 00:18:56,077
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as Mara Jade is in it, I'm happy.

249
00:18:56,338 --> 00:18:57,919
[SPEAKER_06]: The books will not be turned into movies.

250
00:18:58,239 --> 00:18:58,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Period.

251
00:18:58,679 --> 00:18:59,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Mara Jade needs to be in it.

252
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,340
[SPEAKER_06]: You're stretching it.

253
00:19:01,461 --> 00:19:08,645
[SPEAKER_06]: That may happen only because they ended up calling one of the planets Coruscant in the prequels because that came from the books.

254
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but they also referenced it in, I think, the first one.

255
00:19:13,684 --> 00:19:17,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, Tiger Claw says, how about Joss Whedon directing Star Wars?

256
00:19:17,768 --> 00:19:18,389
[SPEAKER_06]: I could go with that.

257
00:19:18,969 --> 00:19:24,214
[SPEAKER_06]: I think while that would make a lot of nerds happy, why don't you give him the time to do all this stuff with the Avengers?

258
00:19:24,354 --> 00:19:25,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, he's one guy.

259
00:19:26,036 --> 00:19:28,098
[SPEAKER_06]: He can't do everything nerd.

260
00:19:29,139 --> 00:19:29,419
[SPEAKER_06]: I would...

261
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:33,697
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to see some of these, oh God, I'm going to get so much.

262
00:19:33,717 --> 00:19:34,797
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see Kashyyyk in it.

263
00:19:35,137 --> 00:19:43,860
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to get so much shit for this, but I think it would be really cool to get somebody like one of the Harry Potter directors that made the really, like.

264
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,861
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking forward to Tim Burton's adaptation of Star Trek.

265
00:19:46,921 --> 00:19:47,462
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no, no.

266
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:49,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Alfonso Cuaron, who did the third.

267
00:19:51,243 --> 00:19:55,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Guillermo del Toro, although he didn't do a Harry Potter movie, but he's, you know, Pan's Labyrinth and all the stuff he does.

268
00:19:56,305 --> 00:19:57,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Directed by Francis Ford Cooper.

269
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:58,230
[SPEAKER_06]: Gloom.

270
00:20:24,025 --> 00:20:24,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Maniac Mansion

271
00:20:40,925 --> 00:20:47,870
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll probably continue to contract with other developers to do Star Wars on the consoles.

272
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:51,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, if we're talking like Tim Burton, that is a movie that Tim Burton would be perfect doing.

273
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:53,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Maniac Mansion.

274
00:20:53,414 --> 00:20:54,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that would be awesome.

275
00:20:55,575 --> 00:20:56,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, good points in our chat room.

276
00:20:56,796 --> 00:20:58,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan Shadow says ILM.

277
00:20:58,537 --> 00:20:59,298
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very true.

278
00:20:59,598 --> 00:21:01,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Tiger Claw says Skywalker Sound.

279
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,061
[SPEAKER_06]: So Disney picks up all that.

280
00:21:03,101 --> 00:21:03,621
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

281
00:21:03,981 --> 00:21:07,424
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, I'm just going to say, how can it get any worse than...

282
00:21:09,565 --> 00:21:10,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Star Wars Connect Game

283
00:21:18,752 --> 00:21:20,093
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you played that Star Wars Connect game?

284
00:21:20,233 --> 00:21:22,874
[SPEAKER_07]: No, because I'm smart enough to know that it's terrible.

285
00:21:22,994 --> 00:21:24,194
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to remind you.

286
00:21:24,414 --> 00:21:25,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Be quiet, advertisement.

287
00:21:25,655 --> 00:21:33,578
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to remind you of a little sequence that's in the Star Wars Connect game, and that is the dance battle to I'm Han Solo.

288
00:21:33,978 --> 00:21:36,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me play a little clip of that.

289
00:21:36,499 --> 00:21:38,020
[SPEAKER_07]: All of the songs are equally terrible.

290
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:40,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to remind you how bad things can be.

291
00:21:42,021 --> 00:21:43,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Just want to remind you of that here.

292
00:21:49,113 --> 00:21:50,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you seen this before, DarkSakura?

293
00:21:50,938 --> 00:21:52,242
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the Star Wars Connect game.

294
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:04,971
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's going to get worse under Disney?

295
00:22:06,093 --> 00:22:07,274
[SPEAKER_06]: It can't get worse.

296
00:22:07,835 --> 00:22:08,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Famous last words.

297
00:22:09,057 --> 00:22:10,318
[SPEAKER_06]: It can't get worse.

298
00:22:10,438 --> 00:22:10,639
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

299
00:22:21,314 --> 00:22:28,558
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Ragenator says, just wait, Disney will buy the rights to Rocky Horror Picture Show next and then they'll blend Star Wars and Rocky Horror Picture Show and Sky would probably squeak.

300
00:22:28,598 --> 00:22:31,500
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that wouldn't happen because that would involve buying 20th Century Fox.

301
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,162
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think there's laws set up for that big of an acquisition.

302
00:22:35,182 --> 00:22:39,825
[SPEAKER_06]: That means we can have meetings in space.

303
00:22:39,865 --> 00:22:40,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

304
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:44,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma says, so how long before Disney makes Marvel a former shell of itself?

305
00:22:44,748 --> 00:22:44,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh!

306
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:50,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, Disney really fucked up Marvel with that Avengers movie.

307
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:52,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, that was terrible.

308
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and Disney really fucked the Muppets over.

309
00:22:54,501 --> 00:22:57,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that new Muppets movie was really bad compared to the last couple.

310
00:23:00,865 --> 00:23:01,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Dot, dot, dot.

311
00:23:04,788 --> 00:23:05,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Is your mic off?

312
00:23:05,208 --> 00:23:06,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, my mic was off, sorry.

313
00:23:06,669 --> 00:23:08,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Now they just need to buy the Mega Man franchise.

314
00:23:09,831 --> 00:23:11,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yes to that.

315
00:23:11,652 --> 00:23:12,453
[SPEAKER_06]: And Blizzard.

316
00:23:13,635 --> 00:23:14,857
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

317
00:23:33,719 --> 00:23:36,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Disney still has licensing rights to Indiana Jones.

318
00:23:36,804 --> 00:23:40,750
[SPEAKER_02]: How else are they going to have the ride, for one thing?

319
00:23:41,131 --> 00:23:44,456
[SPEAKER_02]: How else are they going to have all of the merchandise that they sell at Disneyland?

320
00:23:44,597 --> 00:23:46,540
[SPEAKER_02]: And on top of that, they have the pinball table.

321
00:23:47,472 --> 00:23:54,097
[SPEAKER_06]: This is how Indiana Jones... Indiana Jones will come again, but it's going to be in about 10 to 15 years.

322
00:23:55,458 --> 00:24:00,542
[SPEAKER_06]: Indiana Jones is what Disney will do after the trilogy is done, and that's going to be a good 10 years away.

323
00:24:00,823 --> 00:24:05,406
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to do Indiana Jones next, and it will be the good old-fashioned Hollywood fix-it reboot.

324
00:24:05,526 --> 00:24:06,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Just wait for it.

325
00:24:06,447 --> 00:24:07,788
[SPEAKER_02]: We do not want a Shia LaBeouf.

326
00:24:08,469 --> 00:24:08,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Reboot.

327
00:24:09,329 --> 00:24:10,290
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a good actor.

328
00:24:10,931 --> 00:24:11,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying, good actor.

329
00:24:11,751 --> 00:24:13,353
[SPEAKER_06]: A reboot could put a good actor in the role.

330
00:24:13,713 --> 00:24:14,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Just saying.

331
00:24:15,394 --> 00:24:15,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow.

332
00:24:15,714 --> 00:24:17,955
[SPEAKER_02]: But as long... It needs to be done after we're all dead.

333
00:24:18,195 --> 00:24:18,435
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

334
00:24:19,015 --> 00:24:20,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Too much movies, not enough games.

335
00:24:20,796 --> 00:24:22,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about video games again.

336
00:24:22,556 --> 00:24:26,617
[SPEAKER_06]: We always like to start off the show, you know, 30 minutes into it, with how was your gaming week?

337
00:24:26,877 --> 00:24:28,918
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about the video games that you've been playing this week.

338
00:24:28,958 --> 00:24:29,938
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

339
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:35,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I actually didn't get to play much because I started a job.

340
00:24:35,939 --> 00:24:36,600
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a job now.

341
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Congrats.

342
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

343
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:38,660
[SPEAKER_02]: And I...

344
00:24:43,928 --> 00:24:49,751
[SPEAKER_02]: I downloaded a demo for a game that I'm going to talk about in Part B. I never got a chance to play it because I've been working.

345
00:24:50,431 --> 00:24:55,253
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've been playing a bunch of Mass Effect 2 because I beat Mass Effect 1 earlier.

346
00:24:55,273 --> 00:24:57,134
[SPEAKER_02]: I finally did everything in the first Mass Effect.

347
00:24:57,394 --> 00:25:01,596
[SPEAKER_06]: So it wasn't that you played the demo because you didn't play the demo because you were working.

348
00:25:01,636 --> 00:25:03,957
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't play the demo because you were playing Mass Effect 2.

349
00:25:04,057 --> 00:25:04,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's be real.

350
00:25:06,808 --> 00:25:07,389
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.

351
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:10,330
[SPEAKER_02]: And I logged into WoW long enough so I wouldn't get booted from the guild.

352
00:25:11,951 --> 00:25:16,313
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't touched WoW more than long enough to say hi to people since.

353
00:25:17,653 --> 00:25:20,775
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the record, I still can't get in my Mass Effect 3, just saying.

354
00:25:21,575 --> 00:25:22,315
[SPEAKER_06]: That's still a thing?

355
00:25:22,796 --> 00:25:23,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

356
00:25:23,476 --> 00:25:25,517
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched that mod ending.

357
00:25:27,855 --> 00:25:29,356
[SPEAKER_02]: It was terrible.

358
00:25:29,656 --> 00:25:35,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, somebody actually made a mod that will change the ending to the happy ending.

359
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:37,921
[SPEAKER_06]: They call it the Mass Effect 3 happy ending.

360
00:25:37,941 --> 00:25:39,762
[SPEAKER_02]: The clipping issues, though.

361
00:25:39,822 --> 00:25:47,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the thing that cracked me the fuck up is that they inserted video footage, obviously, from other places in the game, but some of them had an IGN watermark.

362
00:25:47,426 --> 00:25:48,107
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like...

363
00:25:48,948 --> 00:25:49,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

364
00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:50,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, really.

365
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:51,993
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean, that was what I was thinking.

366
00:25:52,053 --> 00:25:52,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

367
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:53,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, yeah.

368
00:25:53,556 --> 00:25:57,503
[SPEAKER_02]: And on top of that, most of the footage of the space battle thing is from the low E...

369
00:26:00,949 --> 00:26:01,930
[SPEAKER_02]: Preparedness thing.

370
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:03,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

371
00:26:04,131 --> 00:26:05,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

372
00:26:05,471 --> 00:26:06,372
[SPEAKER_06]: The universe rating.

373
00:26:06,412 --> 00:26:12,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've watched all the different versions of the endings to see what affected what.

374
00:26:12,815 --> 00:26:17,477
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, that's from the super low I did shit where the Normandy explodes and everyone dies ending.

375
00:26:18,198 --> 00:26:18,858
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, really?

376
00:26:18,878 --> 00:26:19,918
[SPEAKER_02]: This must be a happy ending, huh?

377
00:26:21,719 --> 00:26:21,999
[SPEAKER_02]: It was...

378
00:26:24,085 --> 00:26:27,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting to see it pulled off, but I'm not ready to install it.

379
00:26:27,807 --> 00:26:29,908
[SPEAKER_02]: I like my Destroy ending.

380
00:26:30,448 --> 00:26:31,429
[SPEAKER_02]: That's canon in my head.

381
00:26:32,689 --> 00:26:40,733
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very impressive to me that people can mod the ending and that that's a thing now, to mod the ending to make it the way you want.

382
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:46,356
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just like, oh my god, the new trilogy can't get here fast enough, so people have something new to bitch about.

383
00:26:46,957 --> 00:26:59,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the whole thing is that in theory I know how it can be done because really it would be changing code to insert sequence for pre-rendered stuff and screens for all of the little flashback-y things.

384
00:27:00,727 --> 00:27:07,812
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it would actually be taking pre-existing animations and loading different textures over them.

385
00:27:09,337 --> 00:27:18,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, by the way, that picture of Jacob's face over Garrus' body is absolutely hilarious because he has his mouth expanded like it was for the whole Garrus face.

386
00:27:18,755 --> 00:27:19,336
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

387
00:27:42,318 --> 00:28:04,653
[SPEAKER_02]: well yeah I saw that one mod or whatever that Loki was talking about a couple weeks ago on the show that changed all the characters to other gaming franchise characters but that was it yeah this is just like you have a different frame for the animation which in Mass Effect is actually a lot easier because they all use a human skeleton but not so much in Smash Brothers so anyway

388
00:28:05,107 --> 00:28:08,711
[SPEAKER_06]: TheRobD in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, I'm over Mass Effect 3.

389
00:28:08,891 --> 00:28:12,635
[SPEAKER_06]: There's too much else to enjoy to continue bitching about Mass Effect 3.

390
00:28:13,076 --> 00:28:13,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Ain't that the truth?

391
00:28:14,037 --> 00:28:17,300
[SPEAKER_06]: And multiplayer is really great in Mass Effect 3.

392
00:28:17,441 --> 00:28:18,261
[SPEAKER_02]: If it works!

393
00:28:18,602 --> 00:28:20,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, on Xbox it's been great.

394
00:28:22,426 --> 00:28:22,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anyhow.

395
00:28:23,447 --> 00:28:24,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

396
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:26,613
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically Minecraft.

397
00:28:26,633 --> 00:28:28,895
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's what I've been doing most of the week.

398
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:36,023
[SPEAKER_07]: I finally got the option to switch the server over to a bucket server, which is a server that allows mods.

399
00:28:36,163 --> 00:28:37,205
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what I did.

400
00:28:37,365 --> 00:28:39,367
[SPEAKER_07]: I have it running on a bucket server now.

401
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:45,294
[SPEAKER_07]: So aside from the Dynamap thing that I talked about before...

402
00:28:46,414 --> 00:28:55,717
[SPEAKER_07]: We also have now WorldEdit, which is kind of cool for making structures and stuff really fast and also for leveling mountains and that kind of fun stuff.

403
00:28:56,077 --> 00:28:56,557
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have that.

404
00:28:56,877 --> 00:29:02,999
[SPEAKER_07]: And Mob Arena, which I'm setting up right now, a PvE arena where you can fight.

405
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:05,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Waves and Waves of Monsters

406
00:29:27,618 --> 00:29:44,906
[SPEAKER_07]: so we've got a lot of work to do on that and then I'll play a little bit of Call of Duty this week and hopefully I'll be playing Black Ops 2 in a couple weeks here and that's pretty much it I think I haven't really played a whole ton this week

407
00:29:45,834 --> 00:29:46,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm kind of in the same boat as you.

408
00:29:47,034 --> 00:29:48,235
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't played a whole ton this week.

409
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:53,277
[SPEAKER_06]: More World of Warcraft, which I'll talk about on Horde House, the other show, a little later this week.

410
00:29:53,337 --> 00:29:57,058
[SPEAKER_06]: But a little preview, a follow-up for those of you that do listen to Horde House.

411
00:29:57,558 --> 00:30:00,059
[SPEAKER_06]: Our guild did take down the first raid boss, finally.

412
00:30:00,139 --> 00:30:00,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

413
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:01,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Puppies are dead.

414
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:04,440
[SPEAKER_06]: And the trick was, use three healers instead of two.

415
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:07,261
[SPEAKER_06]: The minute we ran it with three healers, we had it down in three pulls.

416
00:30:07,861 --> 00:30:09,722
[SPEAKER_06]: As opposed to, like, the 20 before that.

417
00:30:09,842 --> 00:30:10,962
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that was the trick.

418
00:30:11,703 --> 00:30:11,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

419
00:30:12,723 --> 00:30:32,320
[SPEAKER_06]: and then I did play some Mass Effect 3 multiplayer not to make this a Mass Effect show but they did have the Halloween challenge which I thought was really cute because they modded the game to make like the little beacons turned into pumpkins and the little devices that you did the upload from were all little pumpkins and you know they did that and then you had these certain little mini achievements that you get the new banner

420
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:37,122
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I thought that was a pretty hefty reward because it's really hard and you have to play a lot to get a lot of those banners.

421
00:30:37,423 --> 00:30:39,023
[SPEAKER_06]: But the Halloween challenge unlocks a banner.

422
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:41,705
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was like, oh, I want to get a banner for no particular reason.

423
00:30:41,765 --> 00:30:42,805
[SPEAKER_06]: My EP needs it.

424
00:30:43,266 --> 00:30:43,906
[SPEAKER_06]: So I did that.

425
00:30:44,166 --> 00:30:46,267
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, that was the Halloween challenge.

426
00:30:47,788 --> 00:30:49,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Screw that Vanguard challenge, though.

427
00:30:49,489 --> 00:30:53,331
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not doing that one because I don't really like Vanguards as much as all my friends seem to.

428
00:30:54,711 --> 00:30:55,792
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, this is the next, next iPad.

429
00:31:16,658 --> 00:31:17,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

430
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:22,942
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm too addicted to the Wheel of Fortune, and it's the quiz game.

431
00:31:22,982 --> 00:31:24,103
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that damn quiz game.

432
00:31:24,123 --> 00:31:28,265
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if every Dave & Buster's has it, but it's like the giant quiz machine with the three buttons.

433
00:31:29,005 --> 00:31:30,706
[SPEAKER_06]: We just sit there and play that for like an hour.

434
00:31:31,027 --> 00:31:35,769
[SPEAKER_06]: Just keep putting the tickets in or swiping the card and getting tickets.

435
00:31:35,789 --> 00:31:35,910
[SPEAKER_00]: No DDR?

436
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:39,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I don't believe they have a DDR machine anymore.

437
00:31:40,272 --> 00:31:41,313
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Dave and Buster's never did.

438
00:31:41,353 --> 00:31:45,676
[SPEAKER_06]: They always only had Pump It Up, but they replaced it with a giant Connect 4 machine.

439
00:31:46,096 --> 00:31:49,659
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, oh my, the thing is so bright, you can see it from space.

440
00:31:49,979 --> 00:31:50,559
[SPEAKER_06]: It's crazy.

441
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,641
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it's just Connect 4, whatever.

442
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,183
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the one by us has an X2.

443
00:31:56,343 --> 00:31:57,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Do they?

444
00:31:58,364 --> 00:31:58,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

445
00:31:59,265 --> 00:32:01,126
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't have Pump, I don't think.

446
00:32:01,607 --> 00:32:01,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

447
00:32:02,403 --> 00:32:03,284
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

448
00:32:25,267 --> 00:32:26,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

449
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:55,547
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

450
00:33:15,813 --> 00:33:17,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Master Chief wakes up after a long time.

451
00:33:17,634 --> 00:33:23,197
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's pretty much kind of... Well, a lot of it depends on what friends of mine are going to be playing Halo 4.

452
00:33:23,317 --> 00:33:26,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Halo 2 was the best because I played it with my college buddies.

453
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,741
[SPEAKER_06]: And this was a little bit after college when that game first came out.

454
00:33:29,781 --> 00:33:32,403
[SPEAKER_06]: And we would have our night that we would all play Halo 2.

455
00:33:32,783 --> 00:33:34,544
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was just us, no strangers.

456
00:33:34,564 --> 00:33:35,364
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had a great time.

457
00:33:35,665 --> 00:33:37,886
[SPEAKER_06]: When I went to Halo 3, that kind of fell apart.

458
00:33:38,186 --> 00:33:39,827
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it was mostly strangers in Halo 3.

459
00:33:40,067 --> 00:33:40,668
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was kind of like...

460
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:48,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Having my ass handed to me by strangers isn't as much fun as when it's people you know.

461
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:55,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Bonds006 in our chatroom says, I just did Halo 1, 2, and 3.

462
00:33:56,157 --> 00:33:57,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Never did the ODST in Wars.

463
00:33:57,979 --> 00:33:59,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm in the same boat, buddy.

464
00:34:00,721 --> 00:34:02,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Ragenator asks kind of a random question.

465
00:34:02,863 --> 00:34:05,826
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll answer this and then we'll go into housekeeping and news.

466
00:34:06,827 --> 00:34:11,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Ragenator asks, Rob, say, have you ever used the games for Windows Marketplace before?

467
00:34:11,571 --> 00:34:17,177
[SPEAKER_06]: I ask because I'm wondering if you can use MS Points on there or do you actually have to use actual dollars and cents?

468
00:34:18,117 --> 00:34:45,898
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe one of the other listeners can correct me I believe it's all dollars and cents on the marketplace I don't think they use the points the only games for Windows I did download it to get that free game Tinker or whatever it was that was in there and when I was really into Game Room you had to have games for Windows for the games that you bought that played on both platforms but that's really about my extent of knowledge of Game for Windows Live so I don't know how the points work there

469
00:34:46,438 --> 00:34:50,241
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Microsoft across the board is moving to regular currency.

470
00:34:50,782 --> 00:34:56,126
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think you see the Microsoft points in the Windows 8 marketplace, for instance.

471
00:34:56,466 --> 00:34:59,048
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think Microsoft's transitioning away from that.

472
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:05,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Although Bonds006 says, I have used the games for Windows and they will use your MS points.

473
00:35:05,494 --> 00:35:06,474
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe I'm wrong.

474
00:35:06,694 --> 00:35:08,436
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought they were transitioning away from that, though.

475
00:35:08,796 --> 00:35:09,757
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe it's one of those...

476
00:35:11,278 --> 00:35:12,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Do it while you can.

477
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:19,264
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure, though, that if they do decide someday to just get rid of Microsoft Points, you can convert them somehow.

478
00:35:19,324 --> 00:35:20,644
[SPEAKER_06]: It's $80 to a dollar.

479
00:35:20,725 --> 00:35:21,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

480
00:35:21,385 --> 00:35:22,486
[SPEAKER_06]: It won't be that difficult.

481
00:35:22,666 --> 00:35:23,727
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wouldn't worry too much about it.

482
00:35:25,148 --> 00:35:25,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

483
00:35:27,449 --> 00:35:29,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Quick housekeeping and then we'll get into tonight's news.

484
00:35:30,131 --> 00:35:34,094
[SPEAKER_06]: So we were going to have an interview tonight with Eddie from Bomani Style.

485
00:35:34,314 --> 00:35:35,675
[SPEAKER_06]: He needed to postpone that.

486
00:35:35,835 --> 00:35:39,278
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you did not see the message on Twitter, that interview will not be happening tonight.

487
00:35:39,378 --> 00:35:41,259
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize if you were tuning in just for that.

488
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:43,081
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you'll enjoy the show anyway.

489
00:35:43,421 --> 00:35:44,542
[SPEAKER_06]: We are going to reschedule that.

490
00:35:44,622 --> 00:35:46,083
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're doing it next week.

491
00:35:46,703 --> 00:35:48,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep an eye on our Twitter for updates.

492
00:35:48,424 --> 00:35:50,106
[SPEAKER_06]: I will post as soon as I have that confirmed.

493
00:35:50,366 --> 00:35:52,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

494
00:35:52,828 --> 00:35:53,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Real life things happen.

495
00:35:53,969 --> 00:35:55,750
[SPEAKER_06]: So Eddie had to do something else tonight.

496
00:35:56,150 --> 00:36:00,753
[SPEAKER_06]: The other housekeeping thing I want to mention.

497
00:36:01,494 --> 00:36:10,440
[SPEAKER_06]: As we mentioned in Part B last week, Orange Lounge Radio was nominated at the Podcast Awards, www.podcastawards.com, for Best Gaming Podcast.

498
00:36:11,021 --> 00:36:15,164
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to try really hard not to spam this like crazy.

499
00:36:15,504 --> 00:36:17,746
[SPEAKER_06]: We're limiting ourselves to once a day.

500
00:36:17,826 --> 00:36:19,587
[SPEAKER_06]: We're trying to be tasteful about it.

501
00:36:20,047 --> 00:36:37,800
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, we really could use the support Competition's gonna be stiff Which, you know, the good news is It seems like the indie broadcasts are the ones that really want it So an indie's probably gonna win, which is great news You know, because the corp cast, they're like Oh, what's this?

502
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,820
[SPEAKER_06]: What's this little award?

503
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:48,187
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, oh, we have money elsewhere Oh, we don't need it So they don't even bother promoting it But, you know, the indies are really trying to get the vote And that's a really good sign that one of them will win

504
00:36:48,647 --> 00:36:49,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

505
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:15,373
[SPEAKER_06]: So remember you can vote once a day between now and November 15th www.podcastawards.com and we are nominated in the best gaming category.

506
00:37:15,453 --> 00:37:24,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't forget if you give them an email address that's not one that you often check, be sure to check it once every 24 hours because you have to verify your vote because they want to make sure you're a real person.

507
00:37:25,163 --> 00:37:30,246
[SPEAKER_06]: and please do not do anything that would get us disqualified by doing something shady.

508
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:32,127
[SPEAKER_06]: So keep it legit.

509
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep it real, y'all.

510
00:37:33,768 --> 00:37:40,532
[SPEAKER_06]: And most importantly, even if you're not going to vote for OLR, please consider keeping it indie because the indie podcasts need it.

511
00:37:41,493 --> 00:37:41,753
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

512
00:37:43,614 --> 00:37:44,775
[SPEAKER_06]: What else do I want to say for housekeeping?

513
00:37:44,835 --> 00:37:48,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio and Google+.

514
00:37:48,377 --> 00:37:49,157
[SPEAKER_06]: We're on there as well.

515
00:37:49,197 --> 00:37:50,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Please join our communities on there.

516
00:37:52,577 --> 00:37:59,801
[SPEAKER_02]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on vognetwork.com, use the passphrase random.

517
00:38:00,621 --> 00:38:02,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get into some gaming news.

518
00:38:02,462 --> 00:38:03,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, start us off.

519
00:38:03,943 --> 00:38:08,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so let's talk a little bit about 38 Studios.

520
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:11,867
[SPEAKER_07]: I know everyone's familiar with the whole debacle with...

521
00:38:12,727 --> 00:38:15,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Kingdoms of Amalur, Reckoning, and all that stuff.

522
00:38:15,288 --> 00:38:25,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, now, apparently, the people that were behind the whole $75 million loan, 438 Studios, are being sued by Rhode Island.

523
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:29,331
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's kind of interesting.

524
00:38:29,451 --> 00:38:32,971
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're actually going after... What was it?

525
00:38:33,172 --> 00:38:33,692
[SPEAKER_07]: It was...

526
00:38:35,792 --> 00:38:54,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Kurt Schilling, and CEO Jennifer McLean, and I guess also the former Economic Development Corporation Director Keith Stokes and Wells Fargo Securities and Barclays Capital.

527
00:38:55,527 --> 00:38:56,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Barclays just owned the company I worked for.

528
00:38:58,234 --> 00:39:06,357
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you work hard for your paychecks, and for your tax dollars to be squandered is unacceptable.

529
00:39:06,717 --> 00:39:13,119
[SPEAKER_07]: The board's legal action was taken to rectify this grave injustice put upon the people of Rhode Island.

530
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,661
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're going after them for money, and...

531
00:39:20,393 --> 00:39:20,713
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

532
00:39:20,833 --> 00:39:21,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully they get it.

533
00:39:22,774 --> 00:39:24,554
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be interesting.

534
00:39:24,794 --> 00:39:30,236
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just trying to recoup any losses that they had because they're out $75 million right now.

535
00:39:30,356 --> 00:39:37,078
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to pretend to know the first thing about investment or how the money worked out in this whole mess.

536
00:39:37,498 --> 00:39:44,660
[SPEAKER_06]: So I am not going to be one of those pundits that's like, yeah, take them through the ringer, get them through all their worth or the other extreme.

537
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,221
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I really just don't know.

538
00:39:47,221 --> 00:39:53,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I just find this shit fascinating that the state of Rhode Island is out this money.

539
00:39:53,686 --> 00:39:56,448
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not some private company.

540
00:39:56,948 --> 00:40:02,752
[SPEAKER_06]: The state is out a large amount of money because of the failure of a video game company.

541
00:40:03,172 --> 00:40:06,314
[SPEAKER_06]: That just kind of blows my mind in a way.

542
00:40:06,694 --> 00:40:13,399
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really unfortunate because it would probably make people hesitant to invest in other video game companies, but I don't know.

543
00:40:13,459 --> 00:40:16,361
[SPEAKER_06]: It just blows my mind.

544
00:40:17,802 --> 00:40:20,884
[SPEAKER_06]: TheRobD in chat says, Kurt Schilling will need to sell everything.

545
00:40:21,104 --> 00:40:23,526
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel bad for everyone involved.

546
00:40:24,206 --> 00:40:25,907
[SPEAKER_06]: And Actdeft follows that up with, yeah.

547
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:33,712
[SPEAKER_06]: And TheRobD follows that up at live.vognetwork.com says, Kurt Schilling was an idiot, but he didn't have evil intentions.

548
00:40:34,293 --> 00:40:37,835
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura followed that up with, he'll need to sell $10 blowjobs.

549
00:40:37,995 --> 00:40:38,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't be immature.

550
00:40:39,796 --> 00:40:40,457
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't be immature.

551
00:40:40,497 --> 00:40:41,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

552
00:40:41,097 --> 00:40:43,819
[SPEAKER_07]: To recoup those kind of losses, he's going to have to sell $100 blowjobs.

553
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:43,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop.

554
00:40:45,751 --> 00:40:48,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was just thinking $10 so that he'd actually get business.

555
00:40:50,077 --> 00:40:57,367
[SPEAKER_06]: TheRobD, again, some good comments in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, he has to pay for his idiocy though.

556
00:40:57,888 --> 00:40:59,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Actions have consequences.

557
00:41:01,049 --> 00:41:01,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

558
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:19,851
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's kind of sad.

559
00:41:19,871 --> 00:41:35,395
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think the game was that bad, but the thing is, it's just not a lot of games do millions and millions of copies sold, and to just count on your game being like a tentpole AAA title that's huge, huge, huge, huge, it's not really realistic.

560
00:41:36,335 --> 00:41:42,176
[SPEAKER_06]: But the whole thing, all that being said, it blows my fucking mind that he was given the money in the first place.

561
00:41:42,676 --> 00:41:44,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, because somebody wrote him that check.

562
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:49,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it because of the sports fame?

563
00:41:49,901 --> 00:41:57,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it because we're so fixated on sports in this country that it's like, oh yeah, when sports royalty walks in and wants to do something, we let them do it.

564
00:41:58,688 --> 00:41:59,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what's to blame?

565
00:42:00,349 --> 00:42:02,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that sports royalty in our culture?

566
00:42:03,031 --> 00:42:10,757
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty sure that in certain counties in California, like Hollywood and stuff like that, you could probably kill a man and get away with it.

567
00:42:10,777 --> 00:42:13,340
[SPEAKER_07]: They give you a gimme, and that's it.

568
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,021
[SPEAKER_07]: It's true, it worked for OJ.

569
00:42:16,562 --> 00:42:21,404
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, a $75 million loan, I mean, that's... They're like, ah, you're good for it.

570
00:42:21,464 --> 00:42:23,405
[SPEAKER_07]: You're a baseball star, right?

571
00:42:23,505 --> 00:42:23,745
[SPEAKER_07]: No?

572
00:42:26,006 --> 00:42:28,027
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no possible way we're going to lose on this.

573
00:42:29,528 --> 00:42:32,169
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100 Matt in our chat says it was because he was Curt Schilling.

574
00:42:32,229 --> 00:42:33,089
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're saying I'm right?

575
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:34,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Question mark?

576
00:42:35,891 --> 00:42:41,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, keep in mind this is the same country that's letting a convicted rapist go free.

577
00:42:42,974 --> 00:42:45,915
[SPEAKER_02]: And the director, the movie director...

578
00:42:48,557 --> 00:42:48,797
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

579
00:42:49,458 --> 00:42:49,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Never mind.

580
00:42:50,299 --> 00:42:50,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Paul W.S.

581
00:42:50,959 --> 00:42:51,840
[SPEAKER_06]: Anderson, I swear.

582
00:42:54,041 --> 00:42:54,342
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

583
00:42:55,122 --> 00:43:00,967
[SPEAKER_06]: And Tiger Claw follows it up saying, yeah, it's got to be because he was a baseball player and the fact he was a World Series winning baseball player.

584
00:43:01,527 --> 00:43:11,715
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyhow, let's just like no one give like, you know, basketball stars this kind of money either for game ideas because would they have given that money to Dennis Rodman?

585
00:43:12,275 --> 00:43:13,136
[SPEAKER_02]: We did have Shaq Fu.

586
00:43:15,185 --> 00:43:21,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I wonder if Shaq Fu sold as many copies, if not more copies, than Knights of Amulet.

587
00:43:22,048 --> 00:43:24,169
[SPEAKER_06]: At least Shaq Fu recovered its costs, maybe.

588
00:43:24,189 --> 00:43:26,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Shaq Fu is a concept I can get behind.

589
00:43:26,309 --> 00:43:29,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Shaq Fu did not put Rhode Island's $75 million into debt.

590
00:43:29,191 --> 00:43:29,651
[SPEAKER_06]: That is true.

591
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:30,891
[SPEAKER_07]: Shaq Fu was harmless.

592
00:43:31,291 --> 00:43:32,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, pretty harmless.

593
00:43:32,772 --> 00:43:36,253
[SPEAKER_06]: Shaq Fu just put me 75 minutes of my time into debt.

594
00:43:36,294 --> 00:43:36,774
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all.

595
00:43:37,574 --> 00:43:38,555
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not as big of a loss.

596
00:43:38,935 --> 00:43:44,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, I remember the game I wanted to talk about during my gaming week before we get into this next thing since we're talking about basketball.

597
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:46,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know what I saw at the mall?

598
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:48,962
[SPEAKER_06]: A demo kiosk for NBA Baller Beats.

599
00:43:49,642 --> 00:43:51,764
[SPEAKER_06]: And I so badly... That looked awkward.

600
00:43:52,064 --> 00:43:56,347
[SPEAKER_06]: I so badly wanted to play it, but I was with my friend, Victoria, and she was judging me so hard.

601
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:57,648
[SPEAKER_07]: She's like, listen, you're too white for this.

602
00:43:57,688 --> 00:43:58,688
[SPEAKER_07]: You're too white for this.

603
00:43:59,229 --> 00:44:00,209
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not going to do that.

604
00:44:00,249 --> 00:44:01,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically.

605
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:04,012
[SPEAKER_02]: And thanks to SSJ100, Matt, it was Roman Pileski.

606
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:07,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that whole thing.

607
00:44:07,151 --> 00:44:09,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, that's a bit of a mess, isn't it?

608
00:44:10,573 --> 00:44:12,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, NBA Baller Beats.

609
00:44:12,874 --> 00:44:15,815
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to say, say what you will.

610
00:44:15,995 --> 00:44:16,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Say what you would.

611
00:44:16,636 --> 00:44:18,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Judge me all you want.

612
00:44:18,337 --> 00:44:19,477
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't give a fuck.

613
00:44:20,238 --> 00:44:21,038
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked fun.

614
00:44:21,318 --> 00:44:21,818
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

615
00:44:22,038 --> 00:44:23,079
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked fun.

616
00:44:28,647 --> 00:44:33,888
[SPEAKER_07]: I can get my boss to give me the copy that we have because it's just sitting there on his desk.

617
00:44:33,908 --> 00:44:34,549
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to play it.

618
00:44:34,609 --> 00:44:35,469
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to lie.

619
00:44:35,729 --> 00:44:37,729
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just waiting for it to go in the clearance bin.

620
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:40,030
[SPEAKER_06]: It won't take much longer.

621
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:41,670
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to check fries once a week.

622
00:44:41,731 --> 00:44:43,871
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be a manager special before we know it.

623
00:44:45,171 --> 00:44:46,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Do they even have them for sale there?

624
00:44:50,362 --> 00:44:50,963
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, moving on.

625
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:53,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Rhode Island's not the only one that's lost money.

626
00:44:54,025 --> 00:45:00,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony, talking about their finances, made a net loss of 15.5 billion yen.

627
00:45:00,589 --> 00:45:05,752
[SPEAKER_06]: That translates to just under $200 million in their second fiscal quarter.

628
00:45:06,113 --> 00:45:09,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Their gaming division has seen a year-on-year decline in profit.

629
00:45:09,935 --> 00:45:11,797
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a year-on-year reduction in loss of 42.6%.

630
00:45:11,877 --> 00:45:14,999
[SPEAKER_06]: That's an improvement over the $312 million they lost during the first quarter.

631
00:45:20,703 --> 00:45:27,491
[SPEAKER_06]: The company has lowered their projections for the end of the year for the PSP and the Vita sales significantly.

632
00:45:27,571 --> 00:45:30,154
[SPEAKER_06]: That's down to 10 million from what they originally projected.

633
00:45:30,234 --> 00:45:33,158
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they're going to come out too well this year to be honest.

634
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:39,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Kaz Hirai in May indicated a fiscal year estimate of $10 million for the Vita alone.

635
00:45:39,502 --> 00:45:44,205
[SPEAKER_06]: The PS3 and the PS2 combined estimate remains untouched at $16 million.

636
00:45:44,906 --> 00:45:50,009
[SPEAKER_06]: On the bright side, software performance saw slight growth across the second quarter.

637
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:53,952
[SPEAKER_06]: So the PS3 and PS2 sales, they've actually rose slightly.

638
00:45:54,352 --> 00:45:56,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's look at the fourth quarter lineup.

639
00:45:56,393 --> 00:45:58,173
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't really have any strong titles.

640
00:45:58,193 --> 00:46:00,934
[SPEAKER_07]: They have PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, which could flop.

641
00:46:01,194 --> 00:46:06,075
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's all right, but it's not going to be like Uncharted or something like that.

642
00:46:06,595 --> 00:46:09,616
[SPEAKER_07]: And they've got LittleBigPlanet Karting, which also could flop.

643
00:46:09,816 --> 00:46:11,997
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, those are both kind of mediocre.

644
00:46:12,717 --> 00:46:17,298
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as AAA titles go, they're not like Mass Effect or Halo.

645
00:46:17,458 --> 00:46:18,859
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just kind of like, huh.

646
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:23,640
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll do all right, but they're not going to be these huge games that people are like,

647
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:28,003
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, I'm going to line up at midnight to go get my PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale.

648
00:46:28,284 --> 00:46:29,064
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a very good point.

649
00:46:29,325 --> 00:46:30,005
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a very good point.

650
00:46:30,025 --> 00:46:31,166
[SPEAKER_06]: These games are not Halo 4.

651
00:46:31,306 --> 00:46:35,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Or like they have the new Sly Cooper game, Thieves in Time?

652
00:46:36,971 --> 00:46:37,251
[SPEAKER_07]: One of those.

653
00:46:37,671 --> 00:46:40,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, so those aren't really that strong titles.

654
00:46:40,314 --> 00:46:41,775
[SPEAKER_07]: And look at what we have for the Vita.

655
00:46:41,795 --> 00:46:44,237
[SPEAKER_07]: The two big games that they've been kind of pimping for the Vita was...

656
00:46:44,737 --> 00:47:02,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Call of Duty Black Ops Declassified which I'm afraid is going to suck in fact I'm pretty sure it's going to suck because the guys that made it were the guys that made the really shitty Resistance game that they were also pimping out really hard and was very mediocre and in Assassin's Creed which I think Assassin's Creed Liberation is actually pretty good but

657
00:47:03,768 --> 00:47:04,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the thing.

658
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:07,970
[SPEAKER_07]: If Sony is losing this money, and Sony's not really selling Vitas like they thought they would...

659
00:47:21,756 --> 00:47:24,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we really think we're going to get a PlayStation 4 next year?

660
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:26,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we still think that's something that's going to happen?

661
00:47:26,782 --> 00:47:35,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm really starting to think a lot of this stuff that we're hearing about game industry troubles because this is not the first we've heard of this.

662
00:47:35,091 --> 00:47:36,633
[SPEAKER_06]: We've heard about layoffs, etc., etc.,

663
00:47:37,694 --> 00:47:38,174
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

664
00:47:57,012 --> 00:48:02,276
[SPEAKER_07]: They're alright, but they're not like these big launch tentpole titles or something like that.

665
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:03,697
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like a new Uncharted.

666
00:48:03,717 --> 00:48:08,441
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they had a new Uncharted last year, but it's not like a big, huge title like that.

667
00:48:08,461 --> 00:48:16,407
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that they're having these dev teams working on something for the next system so they have a strong launch because they know they need that.

668
00:48:18,569 --> 00:48:19,270
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard to say, though.

669
00:48:19,290 --> 00:48:22,732
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think that they're going to have to probably drop the price of the Vita pretty soon because...

670
00:48:23,783 --> 00:48:26,845
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not a whole ton of stuff that's really a selling point.

671
00:48:26,905 --> 00:48:30,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Had I not gotten one, there's not really anything that would have sold me on one.

672
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:35,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Although if they announce a portable Grand Theft Auto 5 game, I'm probably going to have to buy that.

673
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:37,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Any Grand Theft Auto game, I'm probably going to have to buy.

674
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:38,711
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really care what system it's on.

675
00:48:39,311 --> 00:48:43,274
[SPEAKER_06]: YYR in our chatroom says, I played LittleBigPlanet Karting at New York Comic Con.

676
00:48:43,294 --> 00:48:44,114
[SPEAKER_06]: There were no lines.

677
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:48,417
[SPEAKER_06]: It was actually quite fun, but I walked away thinking, will I pay $60 for this?

678
00:48:48,918 --> 00:48:49,158
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

679
00:48:50,178 --> 00:48:54,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob D says at live.vognetwork.com, we absolutely need a new system.

680
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:57,263
[SPEAKER_06]: That said, we also need to reevaluate the game industry.

681
00:48:57,363 --> 00:49:01,266
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem is that companies only change things up when we get new systems.

682
00:49:01,306 --> 00:49:03,967
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that's kind of along the same line I'm thinking of.

683
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:07,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Not so much that we absolutely need a new system, but the whole...

684
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:11,472
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of think the PS3's potential hasn't really been realized.

685
00:49:12,373 --> 00:49:18,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the PS3 does 3D gaming, but is that really a thing that people are doing right now?

686
00:49:18,337 --> 00:49:18,537
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

687
00:49:19,158 --> 00:49:22,560
[SPEAKER_06]: So what is the PS4 going to bring us that the PS3's not doing?

688
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:27,243
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to understand, they've already kind of gotten away from trying to promote 3D as a big thing now.

689
00:49:27,263 --> 00:49:29,104
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't even really mention it too much anymore.

690
00:49:29,485 --> 00:49:34,248
[SPEAKER_07]: And even with 3D TVs, people aren't really sold on 3D TVs, so now they're pushing that whole 4K thing.

691
00:49:34,948 --> 00:49:39,789
[SPEAKER_06]: The Ultra HD TVs So is that going to be the PlayStation 4's big thing?

692
00:49:39,849 --> 00:49:56,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think that was one of the rumored specs is it's going to do that 4K resolution thing But if the PlayStation 3 couldn't get people to adopt 3D successfully Although, to be fair, Blu-ray probably won in large part to the PlayStation 3

693
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:15,707
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, for every maybe failure, you could say that there's been a win But I'm just not convinced that people are going to be like, oh, I need this PlayStation 4 right fucking now Oh, and I need a new Sony Ultra HD TV as well to play... what?

694
00:50:16,107 --> 00:50:23,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you're going to think that any games that are coming out at launch are probably just going to be... They're probably not going to be utilizing that

695
00:50:25,867 --> 00:50:26,128
[SPEAKER_06]: One more.

696
00:50:26,288 --> 00:50:27,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me do one more comment here from chat.

697
00:50:27,749 --> 00:50:29,310
[SPEAKER_06]: The chat's got a lot of good points tonight.

698
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:35,615
[SPEAKER_06]: YYR says, I really think that smartphones and the sort of success of the 3DS have killed the Vita's potential market.

699
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:40,398
[SPEAKER_06]: I really think it's a great system and I'm really enjoying the game library despite its small size.

700
00:50:40,799 --> 00:50:45,062
[SPEAKER_06]: But how many people want one if they have smartphones, a 3DS, or both?

701
00:50:45,943 --> 00:50:47,664
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even touch my DS at all.

702
00:50:47,824 --> 00:50:48,845
[SPEAKER_02]: I play on my phone.

703
00:50:49,507 --> 00:50:52,048
[SPEAKER_06]: I would argue that the 3DS is kind of hurting too.

704
00:50:52,188 --> 00:50:54,588
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we're hearing a very similar story out of Nintendo.

705
00:50:54,608 --> 00:50:59,169
[SPEAKER_06]: It might not be as dire, but Nintendo's lowered expectations of 3DS sales as well.

706
00:51:00,329 --> 00:51:12,912
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do think you're onto something that a lot of it has to do with tablets, smartphones, which is why when you bring out your device and you say it plays Netflix, that was a waste of breath.

707
00:51:14,332 --> 00:51:20,694
[SPEAKER_06]: The fact that your device, Wii U, plays Netflix, that's an expectation now.

708
00:51:21,694 --> 00:51:24,915
[SPEAKER_06]: That's as much of an expectation of it does widescreen.

709
00:51:25,815 --> 00:51:27,516
[SPEAKER_06]: It does HD.

710
00:51:27,616 --> 00:51:28,436
[SPEAKER_06]: It does Netflix.

711
00:51:28,836 --> 00:51:30,176
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like a baseline thing now.

712
00:51:30,897 --> 00:51:35,838
[SPEAKER_06]: So what makes your device better than...

713
00:51:36,738 --> 00:51:42,022
[SPEAKER_06]: A tablet or a smartphone that, you know, far more people have in their pockets and so forth.

714
00:51:42,342 --> 00:51:44,583
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a big part of it, too.

715
00:51:45,244 --> 00:51:46,625
[SPEAKER_06]: iPad Mini ain't gonna help.

716
00:51:48,006 --> 00:51:48,806
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna be honest.

717
00:51:48,846 --> 00:51:58,172
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, like, I've got a smartphone and I have an iPod Touch, you know, 4G, and I don't really use either of them for gaming.

718
00:51:59,693 --> 00:52:00,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Just don't.

719
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:02,215
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, even, like, my portable systems.

720
00:52:02,255 --> 00:52:06,098
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kind of reevaluating whether I even need portable gaming systems because I don't.

721
00:52:06,718 --> 00:52:07,599
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

722
00:52:23,088 --> 00:52:31,190
[SPEAKER_07]: We used to play on the PSP because it was portable and we could get a group of people together and play Grand Theft Auto and stuff.

723
00:52:31,471 --> 00:52:42,114
[SPEAKER_07]: That may be a case where I'd want a system like that to play Grand Theft Auto or some multiplayer game so that we can move around and stuff, be a little bit nomadic.

724
00:52:42,694 --> 00:52:42,874
[SPEAKER_07]: But

725
00:52:44,075 --> 00:52:48,019
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't find the need to have that stuff anymore, it seems like.

726
00:52:48,139 --> 00:52:54,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Even with all the systems, I don't really feel the need, next generation, to own all of the systems.

727
00:52:56,068 --> 00:52:59,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Even before, I felt this expectation because I do this show, oh, I should own all of them.

728
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,601
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope, not really feeling it anymore because I don't play the Wii at all.

729
00:53:03,781 --> 00:53:05,282
[SPEAKER_07]: The Wii is literally collecting dust.

730
00:53:05,322 --> 00:53:07,362
[SPEAKER_07]: I have something stacked on top of it and that was it.

731
00:53:07,862 --> 00:53:11,684
[SPEAKER_07]: We dusted off the other day just to play Sight Truck.

732
00:53:11,744 --> 00:53:12,664
[SPEAKER_07]: I should say my wife did.

733
00:53:13,164 --> 00:53:17,585
[SPEAKER_07]: But I haven't played anything on that for years now.

734
00:53:17,985 --> 00:53:19,366
[SPEAKER_07]: And the PlayStation 3, same thing.

735
00:53:20,466 --> 00:53:26,048
[SPEAKER_07]: We're looking at maybe using the PlayStation 3 for Grand Theft Auto V because it doesn't get disconnected through our firewalls quick, but

736
00:53:26,728 --> 00:53:29,889
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't played anything on that for like a long time.

737
00:53:31,969 --> 00:53:32,669
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie, quick thought?

738
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:49,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was just saying I haven't really... I mean, Dan and I have actually talked about downsizing our collection, you know, because really it's anything that we've wanted to play, I can get on my PC and I can upgrade my PC at any point.

739
00:53:50,534 --> 00:53:52,194
[SPEAKER_02]: It just really isn't, you know...

740
00:53:54,283 --> 00:54:03,230
[SPEAKER_02]: and the other thing too is also look at in terms of the economy people I think this has been the case for us are really looking at needs versus wants

741
00:54:04,167 --> 00:54:05,487
[SPEAKER_02]: A gaming system is a want.

742
00:54:05,507 --> 00:54:06,828
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something you need.

743
00:54:07,768 --> 00:54:08,789
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to pay rent.

744
00:54:09,389 --> 00:54:12,410
[SPEAKER_02]: And that became the priority.

745
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:15,311
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't working at the time.

746
00:54:16,071 --> 00:54:17,852
[SPEAKER_02]: Any of my money couldn't go towards games.

747
00:54:17,972 --> 00:54:20,012
[SPEAKER_02]: It went towards buying food, paying bills.

748
00:54:20,852 --> 00:54:23,413
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this case... Damn responsibility.

749
00:54:23,513 --> 00:54:23,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn it.

750
00:54:23,853 --> 00:54:31,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, but if you look at it, the vast majority of people have been put into the circumstance, instead of having disposable income...

751
00:54:31,676 --> 00:54:34,843
[SPEAKER_02]: They're realizing that, yeah, maybe I don't need this stuff.

752
00:54:34,983 --> 00:54:36,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's just a bonus.

753
00:54:37,239 --> 00:54:38,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me read a few more comments from chat.

754
00:54:38,699 --> 00:54:41,860
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll end on these chat comments and go on into DarkSakura's next story.

755
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:45,000
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's such a good discussion going on in chat tonight.

756
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:47,301
[SPEAKER_06]: I just got to throw these out there for the podcast listeners to hear.

757
00:54:48,041 --> 00:54:52,462
[SPEAKER_06]: YYR says, The 3DS can also fall back on Nintendo's excellent software.

758
00:54:52,522 --> 00:54:53,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't forget Pokemon.

759
00:54:54,122 --> 00:54:58,803
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't really had a... The Pokemon games that just came out were for the last DS, which is fascinating.

760
00:54:58,823 --> 00:55:01,884
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how confident that they were that those games were going to do well on the 3DS.

761
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:03,224
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're probably right, to be fair.

762
00:55:03,784 --> 00:55:06,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Dungeon Buster says, I think I butchered that sentence there, but just the whole thinking ahead point.

763
00:55:28,421 --> 00:55:53,390
[SPEAKER_06]: and lastly Doom Plague says I would be surprised if anyone made a 4k resolution game in the next 10 years it's a non-factor this coming generation all right we could talk about this for a lot longer but I think this discussion is going to be continuing through the next six months right on up to the next E3 when we know what these systems if they're coming at all for one and what they will entail in the meantime let's go to DarkSakura with the next story

764
00:55:53,564 --> 00:55:55,665
[SPEAKER_02]: How about a tale of some corporate fucking greed?

765
00:56:00,548 --> 00:56:09,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Frank Christopher Oliveira, who is the former GameStop VP of Corporate Communications and Public Affairs, got caught.

766
00:56:10,014 --> 00:56:13,957
[SPEAKER_02]: He pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud for embezzling $1,965,900 from GameStop.

767
00:56:18,961 --> 00:56:31,362
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the indictment, he sent payments from January 2009 through April 2011 to Cloud Communications LLC, which was a fictitious company he owned to transfer funds into his personal account.

768
00:56:35,432 --> 00:56:42,497
[SPEAKER_02]: GameStop is no comment, however they are fully cooperating with the federal investigation.

769
00:56:43,437 --> 00:56:49,822
[SPEAKER_02]: He pleaded not guilty and the max sentence to this is 20 years in prison and $250,000 fine.

770
00:56:52,143 --> 00:57:14,601
[SPEAKER_02]: and I hope that he gets the max you know penalty I wish that all of these corporate bastards who steal money from the companies they work for and get away with you know fraud and stealing money out of the consumers pockets get caught too instead of being given you know personhood and all this bullshit just saying people need to be held accountable

771
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:15,601
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com

772
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:34,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Just another sign of how people in positions of power in companies are really abusing their positions.

773
00:57:35,311 --> 00:57:40,495
[SPEAKER_02]: And in return, who has to pay for recouping those losses?

774
00:57:40,555 --> 00:57:42,996
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes back to the consumer when they're figuring out their money's missing.

775
00:57:43,577 --> 00:57:46,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma makes a very tongue-in-cheek comment in our chatroom, but it's worth repeating.

776
00:57:47,319 --> 00:57:48,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Steal from GameStop?

777
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, they've stolen from me enough times.

778
00:57:51,582 --> 00:57:55,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but this is a guy who probably already is a millionaire.

779
00:57:57,224 --> 00:58:05,429
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to remember this is a guy who was feeding money that they already got from you into these fake companies and what have you.

780
00:58:05,669 --> 00:58:08,451
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just amazing he was able to do that much.

781
00:58:08,711 --> 00:58:11,552
[SPEAKER_02]: I want them to nail his ass to the wall.

782
00:58:13,593 --> 00:58:15,094
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes back to a bigger problem.

783
00:58:15,595 --> 00:58:23,319
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes back to more people looking at their own personal greed as opposed to being a better person maybe.

784
00:58:23,519 --> 00:58:25,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you saying look at your life, look at your choices?

785
00:58:25,485 --> 00:58:26,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, look at your life, look at your choices.

786
00:58:27,249 --> 00:58:28,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be a corporate douchette.

787
00:58:29,876 --> 00:58:30,578
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, fair enough.

788
00:58:30,679 --> 00:58:31,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, let's move on.

789
00:58:32,398 --> 00:58:32,698
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

790
00:58:34,059 --> 00:58:43,022
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's talk a little bit about one game I'm very looking forward to, and that would be Grand Theft Auto V. And of course... Since when were you a Grand Theft Auto fan?

791
00:58:43,382 --> 00:58:45,123
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just getting on the bandwagon.

792
00:58:45,163 --> 00:58:46,363
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a long time.

793
00:58:47,384 --> 00:58:54,666
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm gearing up because this month is going to be a lot of news for Grand Theft Auto V. I bet you suddenly became a Giants fan last week, too.

794
00:58:54,967 --> 00:58:58,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I had to become a sports fan first, so that's not going to happen.

795
00:58:59,188 --> 00:59:02,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Grant the Thought of Five, of course, there was a whole bunch of rumors of when it is expected to come out.

796
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:09,514
[SPEAKER_07]: I've already said that it's going to be April or May next year, but they've officially confirmed that, yes, spring 2003 is going to be the release window for the game.

797
00:59:09,914 --> 00:59:18,759
[SPEAKER_07]: And they have some promotional materials that are making it out to GameStops and other places, including Game and stuff internationally.

798
00:59:19,479 --> 00:59:22,721
[SPEAKER_07]: and along with that, some of the promotional stuff.

799
00:59:23,081 --> 00:59:29,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Starting on Monday, November 5th, you can actually pre-order the game from different locations.

800
00:59:30,005 --> 00:59:40,130
[SPEAKER_07]: The rumor was that they were supposed to be doing another trailer on the 5th, although because of the whole hurricane slash storm, it's put them a little bit behind as far as getting that trailer cut.

801
00:59:40,231 --> 00:59:44,533
[SPEAKER_07]: So expect the trailer next week, which I'm really expecting for next week.

802
00:59:45,153 --> 01:00:03,668
[SPEAKER_07]: and they've got some cool little promotional items if you're able to pre-order your game early enough because it's going to be extremely limited supplies you can get a keychain type thing that has like almost like a little viewfinder on there and you can check out some of the locations including they've got Vinewood Hills which is like Hollywood and

803
01:00:04,388 --> 01:00:26,708
[SPEAKER_07]: The Del Perro Pier, like Santa Monica The Vespucci Canals, I guess that's kind of like a downtown LA Grape Seed, which is kind of like Napa Oh boy So it looks interesting Because Napa is so close to LA

804
01:00:27,887 --> 01:00:42,809
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever you know it's just like well San Andreas they had San Francisco Vegas and yeah I know I know it's it's a video game exactly it's all fixed it's all fictitious anyway so right right um and then they've got new posters and stuff like that with like a Lindsay Lohan looking woman on the front

805
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:44,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

806
01:01:06,895 --> 01:01:07,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Very excited.

807
01:01:08,476 --> 01:01:11,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Trying to take your mind off of some of the holiday games that are coming out right now.

808
01:01:11,817 --> 01:01:13,337
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking forward to spring.

809
01:01:13,517 --> 01:01:20,880
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm only picking... The last game I'm picking up this... Well, actually, I should say not the last game, but the second to last game I'm picking up this year is Black Ops 2, followed by Far Cry 3.

810
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:23,201
[SPEAKER_07]: So those will be the last two games I'm getting.

811
01:01:23,421 --> 01:01:25,842
[SPEAKER_07]: And then maybe Halo 4.

812
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:26,202
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

813
01:01:26,222 --> 01:01:26,482
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

814
01:01:27,162 --> 01:01:30,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there are going to be a lot of people picking up Halo 4 this week.

815
01:01:30,323 --> 01:01:35,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Believe it or not, it's here because, you know, the election day is this week and it's the same day Halo 4 is being released.

816
01:01:36,465 --> 01:01:39,766
[SPEAKER_06]: And retailers everywhere are going to be doing midnight releases.

817
01:01:39,806 --> 01:01:41,287
[SPEAKER_06]: GameStop is one of those retailers.

818
01:01:41,327 --> 01:01:44,048
[SPEAKER_06]: They did announce this week 4,400 of their U.S.

819
01:01:44,088 --> 01:01:47,409
[SPEAKER_06]: locations will be open at midnight to sell Halo 4.

820
01:01:48,409 --> 01:01:54,011
[SPEAKER_06]: All the stores that are participating in the event will start their events at 9 o'clock in the local time zone.

821
01:01:54,511 --> 01:02:01,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Do keep in mind, if you're in an area that was impacted by Hurricane Sandy, that may have screwed up some of these GameStops.

822
01:02:01,053 --> 01:02:02,673
[SPEAKER_06]: There's still a lot of places without power.

823
01:02:03,093 --> 01:02:06,214
[SPEAKER_06]: So when in doubt, call ahead and just make sure.

824
01:02:07,274 --> 01:02:13,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably if your store did Assassin's Creed 3, it's probably doing Halo 4, but it's always best to just call ahead.

825
01:02:13,936 --> 01:02:15,296
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing wrong with placing a phone call.

826
01:02:15,316 --> 01:02:20,698
[SPEAKER_06]: If the store that you pre-ordered your game happens to be a playing trade, you're not getting it at midnight.

827
01:02:22,678 --> 01:02:23,279
[SPEAKER_06]: All righty then.

828
01:02:23,679 --> 01:02:30,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I do want to point out, even though GameStop, there's probably a shit ton of other retailers doing the midnight release as well.

829
01:02:31,306 --> 01:02:42,256
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure Walmart's, Best Buy's probably, and basically any place that sells video games will probably be open at midnight because Halo 4 is kind of a big deal.

830
01:02:43,277 --> 01:02:50,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, one other thing I want to talk about with Halo 4 is this interesting little report that's going around the internet this week.

831
01:02:52,462 --> 01:03:03,067
[SPEAKER_06]: 343 Industries apparently not happy with some of the language that players use when they're playing Halo, to which I say, good, make the shit talkers take some accountability.

832
01:03:04,307 --> 01:03:15,451
[SPEAKER_06]: The studio head of 343 Industries, Bonnie Ross, in an interview with GameSpot said, "...I've seen many of the sites that have documented some of the more gender-specific, slanderous comments.

833
01:03:15,951 --> 01:03:20,033
[SPEAKER_06]: This is behavior that is offensive and completely unacceptable.

834
01:03:20,493 --> 01:03:25,275
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to think most of our Xbox Live players don't support this kind of behavior."

835
01:03:27,998 --> 01:03:30,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, just like most of them.

836
01:03:31,101 --> 01:03:32,382
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the best name ever.

837
01:03:33,002 --> 01:03:33,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

838
01:03:54,660 --> 01:03:57,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft can't exactly monitor live games, can they?

839
01:03:57,521 --> 01:03:57,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Well,

840
01:04:25,598 --> 01:04:26,419
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they have a way.

841
01:04:42,142 --> 01:04:47,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I read this story at Destructoid, destructoid.com, and they bring up a really good point that I think is worth repeating.

842
01:04:47,866 --> 01:04:53,049
[SPEAKER_06]: They take issue with the fact that adolescents are the only ones being targeted as being jerks online.

843
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:55,511
[SPEAKER_06]: And they say in this article, quote,

844
01:04:58,453 --> 01:05:26,746
[SPEAKER_06]: Who get their jollies by going into online games and being nasty Or who attempt to bully others because of perceived differences I think that's a damn good point Wasn't there a story around the internet this week or maybe last week About the Reddit trolls and the people posting the really, really bad stuff to Reddit And they traced it back to some 39-year-old guy Just one of your stereotypical basement-going people with nothing better to do And it bears to be repeated

845
01:05:27,586 --> 01:05:45,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Halo 4 is a fucking mature rated game so kids shouldn't be playing in the first place but parents are fucking dumb or I should say parents have made the choice to have their kids play this mature rated game at that same time they should also be responsible for what they say or what they're exposed to

846
01:05:47,135 --> 01:06:03,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Bonds006 in our chatroom says people still cry over what's being said online in a game I'm not sure if I'm taking that like if there's like a hint of sarcasm or something to that comment but like yes and people should take issue to some of the things that are said online in a game like I'm sorry but

847
01:06:04,034 --> 01:06:10,456
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been in Halo matches where I've heard people called faggot and far worse words I'm not going to say on this show.

848
01:06:11,136 --> 01:06:13,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Although they're all bad, let's be real.

849
01:06:13,676 --> 01:06:18,217
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's just like, yes, I take issue to that.

850
01:06:18,477 --> 01:06:24,719
[SPEAKER_06]: As a gay guy who got called that a lot growing up in a very malicious way, who still has many...

851
01:06:25,459 --> 01:06:26,860
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com

852
01:06:53,595 --> 01:06:54,335
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

853
01:07:12,907 --> 01:07:26,532
[SPEAKER_06]: The Big C-Bomb, then that better be a term of endearment or some prearranged thing and not in a negative thing because that's not okay to be calling women at random that word.

854
01:07:26,972 --> 01:07:27,452
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

855
01:07:28,572 --> 01:07:32,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Or even bitch, whore, slut, all those other things.

856
01:07:33,694 --> 01:07:34,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, Jamie?

857
01:07:35,235 --> 01:07:36,255
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of not bothered.

858
01:07:37,515 --> 01:07:42,497
[SPEAKER_06]: So you don't care if you go online and do a random match on Halo 4 and somebody drops the C-Bomb?

859
01:07:43,530 --> 01:07:43,690
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

860
01:07:45,071 --> 01:07:52,094
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because really all I'll do, like, for example, it actually happened in WoW not too long ago, and all I did was just report and put them on ignore.

861
01:07:52,154 --> 01:07:52,734
[SPEAKER_02]: What about my game?

862
01:07:53,975 --> 01:08:03,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, okay, then it didn't get under your skin, but you recognize that, hey, this person should probably have their freedom to play the game taken away from them, right?

863
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:05,420
[SPEAKER_06]: This person is not mature enough to be in this game.

864
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:08,182
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that their ability to speak in said game should be revoked.

865
01:08:08,442 --> 01:08:08,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

866
01:08:09,442 --> 01:08:15,466
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't necessarily think they shouldn't be allowed to play the game because maybe they're good at it.

867
01:08:16,026 --> 01:08:18,568
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think that their ability to speak should be revoked.

868
01:08:19,409 --> 01:08:24,052
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because that's almost more frustrating is not being able to say something to somebody.

869
01:08:24,732 --> 01:08:35,319
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, honestly, I like when you have a feature to just actively ignore something and then have it pop up reverting to them.

870
01:08:36,259 --> 01:08:37,360
[SPEAKER_02]: X person has you ignored.

871
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:54,376
[SPEAKER_02]: then what good is saying anything going to do when the person that you're saying it at can't react isn't going to react to it the people are only doing that for attention they're only doing that because they get something off on it if you're not if they're not bothered by it what good is it going to do

872
01:08:55,342 --> 01:08:59,643
[SPEAKER_06]: I seem to remember Halo 3 had a really quick way to block people like that.

873
01:08:59,743 --> 01:09:08,945
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember reporting on some of the stories that you could just hit the back button and it just shut them up automatically, which I thought was pretty neat.

874
01:09:10,025 --> 01:09:16,507
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I think it should be, but I think that they also need to get the feedback in return that this person isn't paying attention to you.

875
01:09:17,612 --> 01:09:24,018
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that they should because actually it's better if they don't know that because then they can't go, oh, you're not going to listen to me.

876
01:09:24,178 --> 01:09:25,699
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to send an angry message at you.

877
01:09:26,340 --> 01:09:27,661
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it should completely block them.

878
01:09:30,263 --> 01:09:33,586
[SPEAKER_06]: TheRobD, I think this is a very interesting point in chat.

879
01:09:33,606 --> 01:09:34,526
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to throw this out there.

880
01:09:34,626 --> 01:09:35,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Live.VogNetwork.com.

881
01:09:35,747 --> 01:09:44,435
[SPEAKER_06]: TheRobD says, the only way we can improve the quality and diversity of gamers online is to hold them accountable for what they do.

882
01:09:45,211 --> 01:09:45,892
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

883
01:10:03,204 --> 01:10:11,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely hold people accountable, but I'm saying that it's kind of hard for me to try to think of how to phrase it.

884
01:10:11,931 --> 01:10:18,856
[SPEAKER_02]: There are really thin-skinned people out there who, you know, even just saying, oh, you suck is going to piss them off.

885
01:10:19,496 --> 01:10:23,379
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's going to make them, you know, be in a world of boohoo.

886
01:10:23,439 --> 01:10:25,981
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe if they're that thin-skinned, they shouldn't play.

887
01:10:27,471 --> 01:10:28,572
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I see what you're getting at.

888
01:10:28,812 --> 01:10:38,476
[SPEAKER_06]: You're saying that maybe this opens the door to that total political correctness, hypersensitivity, these types of issues.

889
01:10:38,536 --> 01:10:40,396
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, where do you draw the line?

890
01:10:40,737 --> 01:10:54,242
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think we can all agree you don't say certain words ever online, but somebody who might be ultra-religious, grew up in Little House on the Prairie...

891
01:10:54,582 --> 01:11:01,315
[SPEAKER_06]: has every right to play the same Xbox games you do, but would never say the word damn themselves and might take offense to that.

892
01:11:02,398 --> 01:11:11,082
[SPEAKER_02]: I know people who, like a lady in one of my classes who is as Mormon as Mormon can be, doesn't drink coffee, none of that, and she's perfectly fine with other people.

893
01:11:11,362 --> 01:11:15,323
[SPEAKER_02]: She doesn't, you know, she doesn't go la la la la la when someone says crap, you know.

894
01:11:16,024 --> 01:11:18,324
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, she won't do that thing herself.

895
01:11:18,765 --> 01:11:23,687
[SPEAKER_02]: And she won't put herself in a position to where she's surrounded by it all the time.

896
01:11:24,367 --> 01:11:29,249
[SPEAKER_02]: And now if she's in a situation that she can't get away from, she understands and accepts that that's a situation she can't get away with it.

897
01:11:30,449 --> 01:11:31,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Get away from it, you know what I mean?

898
01:11:32,450 --> 01:11:40,513
[SPEAKER_02]: And my big problem, and this actually sort of goes back to the whole big political correctness thing, you know what I mean?

899
01:11:41,834 --> 01:11:48,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that there are people who do take shit way too seriously.

900
01:11:49,077 --> 01:11:56,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there's just some people who, you know, maybe in a moment of frustration are like, well, shit, you suck, you know, I'm just using something, you know?

901
01:11:56,440 --> 01:12:00,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard Dan drop a C-bomb at a game.

902
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:03,404
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he will stop and go, oh my god, I didn't mean to say that.

903
01:12:03,965 --> 01:12:04,265
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?

904
01:12:06,106 --> 01:12:07,447
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's the question.

905
01:12:07,527 --> 01:12:13,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Did he say it in frustration to an NPC, the verbal equivalent of throwing the controller out the window?

906
01:12:13,971 --> 01:12:16,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Or did he actually press the push-to-talk button and call somebody?

907
01:12:17,613 --> 01:12:18,574
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't do that.

908
01:12:18,654 --> 01:12:24,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan is a lot... But he'll go, oh, that was a fucking shit move when he's playing online.

909
01:12:24,478 --> 01:12:26,599
[SPEAKER_02]: He plays Borderlands with his buddies.

910
01:12:27,219 --> 01:12:31,202
[SPEAKER_02]: But the point with it is that I think there's a very...

911
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:40,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to think of how to... There is a lot of room for...

912
01:12:43,900 --> 01:12:46,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Oversensitizing things, you know what I mean?

913
01:12:46,862 --> 01:13:01,872
[SPEAKER_06]: There would be opportunity to take action against somebody that you don't like for other reasons Like taking advantage of it to get somebody punished Just because you want to punish for something that has nothing to do with the game, right?

914
01:13:02,673 --> 01:13:10,358
[SPEAKER_02]: If it was going to be... I would rather have a strike rule I'm going to go way back and go to DDR Freak

915
01:13:12,414 --> 01:13:14,383
[SPEAKER_06]: You think the nine point system should be universal.

916
01:13:15,347 --> 01:13:16,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Explain the system.

917
01:13:17,122 --> 01:13:23,848
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a 9 point rule, which basically for horrible offenses, then yeah, they would get docked 3 points.

918
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:25,209
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a 3 strike.

919
01:13:25,550 --> 01:13:30,014
[SPEAKER_02]: 3 really bad offenses, and yeah, they got banned after 9 points.

920
01:13:31,235 --> 01:13:43,346
[SPEAKER_02]: But if there were very minor offenses, like maybe something that was mildly inflammatory or maybe unintentionally flaming, then yeah, they got basically a 1 point warn for it.

921
01:13:43,926 --> 01:14:07,908
[SPEAKER_02]: and I don't think that it was the warnings that could go like a person could bring something to my attention as a moderator and I'd make a judgment call if I got five things about one person from the same person I'd only warn once because clearly there's something more going on and if it seems like it's legit I'll do the full three point warning for all five offenses you know that example that was my mentality towards it

922
01:14:08,949 --> 01:14:21,794
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're going into, you know, if you say that you've got somebody who's really oversensitive playing their first round of Halo 4 forever and someone, you know, just...

923
01:14:23,613 --> 01:14:25,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's out, you know, oh, that was fucking cheap.

924
01:14:26,014 --> 01:14:29,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, makes one statement, oh, you don't know how to play.

925
01:14:29,675 --> 01:14:30,936
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going mild with it.

926
01:14:31,356 --> 01:14:36,037
[SPEAKER_02]: And that person gets really butthurt and says, oh, you said something offensive to me.

927
01:14:36,778 --> 01:14:46,061
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, even in the case of constructive criticism, because I've seen people in WoW, when you try to give them feedback on how they're playing, and they go completely off on you.

928
01:14:46,121 --> 01:14:48,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't tell me how to fucking play my character, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

929
01:14:48,882 --> 01:14:51,843
[SPEAKER_02]: When really the person was just giving really good constructive feedback.

930
01:14:52,803 --> 01:14:53,404
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

931
01:15:16,519 --> 01:15:17,960
[SPEAKER_02]: There's people like that in the world.

932
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:24,687
[SPEAKER_02]: People who will take offense to any little thing and go on a fucking rampage trying to prove that they're right.

933
01:15:26,128 --> 01:15:26,729
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know what I mean.

934
01:15:27,490 --> 01:15:30,633
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we have so many stupid lawsuits go into effect.

935
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:33,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Violent video game laws, all this.

936
01:15:33,295 --> 01:15:37,019
[SPEAKER_02]: We have quite a bit of hypersensitivity going on.

937
01:15:40,642 --> 01:15:52,094
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really trying to get how... I mean, if you've got someone who, yeah, they've dropped the C-bomb three different times in one game and everyone's put out the warning on them, ban them.

938
01:15:53,075 --> 01:15:56,519
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's with their buddies and their buddies are doing it too, warn each of their buddies.

939
01:15:56,619 --> 01:15:57,960
[SPEAKER_02]: They get booted from the game for an hour.

940
01:15:58,020 --> 01:15:59,582
[SPEAKER_02]: They get a certain number of warns.

941
01:15:59,942 --> 01:16:00,663
[SPEAKER_02]: They're gone forever.

942
01:16:02,605 --> 01:16:03,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Give them a three strikes.

943
01:16:05,467 --> 01:16:07,410
[SPEAKER_06]: The DDR Freak System should be applied everywhere.

944
01:16:08,151 --> 01:16:09,432
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was wise.

945
01:16:09,452 --> 01:16:13,658
[SPEAKER_06]: The one part you missed, if you were good, you would start to lose points every month.

946
01:16:14,058 --> 01:16:14,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

947
01:16:15,119 --> 01:16:21,007
[SPEAKER_02]: But honestly, I actually did see that starting to really benefit.

948
01:16:21,207 --> 01:16:23,330
[SPEAKER_06]: And I never, ever got a point, ever.

949
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:25,995
[SPEAKER_02]: I can fix that.

950
01:16:26,175 --> 01:16:27,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Not when they're dead.

951
01:16:28,216 --> 01:16:29,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Not when they're dead.

952
01:16:29,457 --> 01:16:39,942
[SPEAKER_02]: But my point is that if you've got someone who's having a really shitty day and they go off on someone, yeah, they should be held accountable for going off on somebody.

953
01:16:40,442 --> 01:16:41,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

954
01:16:56,187 --> 01:16:56,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Knock them out.

955
01:16:56,908 --> 01:16:59,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't even give a number of how many warnings you have.

956
01:16:59,550 --> 01:17:00,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't advertise that shit.

957
01:17:01,091 --> 01:17:03,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't advertise that your points will drop off.

958
01:17:03,794 --> 01:17:08,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Just say you get a certain amount of warning again, you're dropped.

959
01:17:09,178 --> 01:17:10,099
[SPEAKER_02]: It is up to us.

960
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:11,260
[SPEAKER_02]: We can give you one strike.

961
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:12,461
[SPEAKER_02]: We can give you three strikes.

962
01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:14,243
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on what we see.

963
01:17:15,194 --> 01:17:17,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well gosh, we get to keep talking about this.

964
01:17:17,196 --> 01:17:18,577
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had a lot of good discussions tonight.

965
01:17:18,617 --> 01:17:19,258
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up with this?

966
01:17:19,338 --> 01:17:20,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this supposed to be a slow news week?

967
01:17:21,801 --> 01:17:32,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Live.VogNetwork.com We could, again, keep this topic going forever, but we do want to end, you know, at some point tonight instead of tomorrow morning, so we're going to keep moving on in the interest of time.

968
01:17:32,471 --> 01:17:36,635
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they were right about Dancer X. Why don't we go to that next story, DarkSakura?

969
01:17:37,839 --> 01:17:40,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, my voice comes back.

970
01:17:41,542 --> 01:17:46,725
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure I've told this story before about my copy of Descent that I used to have that came on 14 discs.

971
01:17:47,866 --> 01:17:50,328
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, I sat and installed... That was the way to play.

972
01:17:51,633 --> 01:17:51,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Report it!

973
01:17:52,013 --> 01:17:52,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Report it!

974
01:18:14,602 --> 01:18:15,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

975
01:18:31,076 --> 01:18:46,045
[SPEAKER_02]: and the big thing about this is basically he's going sort of the path of Black Mesa where it's called Descent to UDK where it's not exactly a remake but it's going to bring in the original story with some embellishments.

976
01:18:46,105 --> 01:18:53,670
[SPEAKER_02]: He's basically trying to diversify the original gameplay and emphasize the scary bits and new weapons.

977
01:18:53,830 --> 01:18:54,471
[SPEAKER_02]: New weapons was good.

978
01:18:55,211 --> 01:18:59,954
[SPEAKER_02]: But man, Descent was the first game I played that gave me motion sickness.

979
01:19:02,048 --> 01:19:23,847
[SPEAKER_02]: and I sucked at it oh man but I loved it for people our age they all remember the first time playing a game like Descent it was like it's doom in 360 degrees it's so cool it was even more than that instead of having your little space shooters where you're on rails or going through different areas you had full freedom of movement it was amazing

980
01:19:24,868 --> 01:19:36,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I mean, yeah, there were more games, you know, there was when it went into Descent 3, but going back to the original and bringing in those factors that made the original great is, I think, a good idea.

981
01:19:36,837 --> 01:19:44,602
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, uh, Eurogamer actually has a, uh, um, trailer for it up on their website, and it looked pretty good.

982
01:19:46,563 --> 01:19:47,664
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked the music in Descent 2.

983
01:19:47,904 --> 01:19:48,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

984
01:19:49,386 --> 01:19:54,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's move on and travel around the world and check out some release dates and things that are coming through more official channels this week.

985
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:56,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think there's something coming out this week.

986
01:19:57,241 --> 01:19:58,361
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure there's a game.

987
01:19:59,281 --> 01:19:59,922
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get to it, though.

988
01:20:00,642 --> 01:20:01,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

989
01:20:01,442 --> 01:20:02,562
[SPEAKER_07]: What have we got this week?

990
01:20:02,963 --> 01:20:04,763
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the big game that's coming out?

991
01:20:04,803 --> 01:20:10,625
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's Freaky Forms Deluxe Creations Alive on 3DS.

992
01:20:10,925 --> 01:20:11,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that it?

993
01:20:11,605 --> 01:20:11,865
[SPEAKER_07]: No?

994
01:20:12,146 --> 01:20:12,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe?

995
01:20:13,806 --> 01:20:16,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's a game for a system that's not out for a couple weeks.

996
01:20:16,247 --> 01:20:19,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Mass Effect 3, the special edition for the Wii U.

997
01:20:21,328 --> 01:20:22,490
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I probably want to wait on that one.

998
01:20:22,510 --> 01:20:23,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, that's out this week?

999
01:20:24,452 --> 01:20:25,253
[SPEAKER_06]: How does that work?

1000
01:20:27,175 --> 01:20:27,936
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1001
01:20:28,477 --> 01:20:29,959
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the dates need adjusting.

1002
01:20:29,979 --> 01:20:30,259
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they're...

1003
01:20:33,653 --> 01:20:36,074
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got in hand like Scribblenauts already.

1004
01:20:37,815 --> 01:20:40,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that we can do anything with it.

1005
01:20:40,637 --> 01:20:47,781
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's Nickelodeon Bubble Guppies on the DS or Nickelodeon Team Umizoomi and Dora's Fantastic Flight.

1006
01:20:48,361 --> 01:20:51,963
[SPEAKER_07]: Both rated EC for those hardcore gamers out there on the DS.

1007
01:20:53,223 --> 01:20:56,065
[SPEAKER_07]: or maybe Nickelodeon Dance 2 on the Wii and Xbox 360.

1008
01:20:57,806 --> 01:20:57,986
[SPEAKER_07]: No?

1009
01:20:58,646 --> 01:20:58,786

1011
01:21:04,650 --> 01:21:04,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe?

1012
01:21:05,330 --> 01:21:05,450
[SPEAKER_07]: No?

1013
01:21:06,471 --> 01:21:09,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Mass Effect Trilogy on PC and Xbox 360.

1014
01:21:09,052 --> 01:21:10,993
[SPEAKER_06]: That is absolutely the game.

1015
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:12,454
[SPEAKER_07]: That has everybody.

1016
01:21:13,074 --> 01:21:13,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.

1017
01:21:14,615 --> 01:21:17,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Midway Arcade Origins on PS3 and Xbox 360 this week.

1018
01:21:20,614 --> 01:21:22,575
[SPEAKER_07]: I bought that last generation.

1019
01:21:23,335 --> 01:21:28,638
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, History Legends of War Patton on Xbox 360 and PS3.

[SPEAKER_07]: Pop Tropica Adventures on the DS.

1022
01:21:35,521 --> 01:21:41,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Dragon Ball Z Budokai HD Collection on PS3 and Xbox 360.

1023
01:21:41,925 --> 01:21:43,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Ragnarok Tactics on PSP.

1024
01:21:47,168 --> 01:22:06,235
[SPEAKER_07]: on PSP PSP not Vita PSP they just had a Ragnarok game on Vita already it came out last week Saints Row the third the full package on PS3 and Xbox 360 let's be honest so this really has the same content that was already on disc for the last game

1025
01:22:09,318 --> 01:22:17,312
[SPEAKER_07]: except for the three expansions but all the other DLC was on disc Big Time Rush Dance Party on the Wii

[SPEAKER_04]: Oh boy.

1028

[SPEAKER_02]: You really like to go left.

1029
01:22:51,338 --> 01:22:52,238
[SPEAKER_02]: You really like Tide.

1030
01:22:52,258 --> 01:22:58,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to go to one of those midnight releases and pick up LittleBigPlanet Karting?

1031
01:22:59,903 --> 01:23:01,884
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not even sure if I'm going to pick up LittleBigPlanet Karting.

1032
01:23:01,984 --> 01:23:04,005
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to play it, but I haven't played LittleBigPlanet 2.

1033
01:23:05,999 --> 01:23:07,060
[SPEAKER_07]: So, probably not.

1034
01:23:07,940 --> 01:23:09,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I do like carding games.

1035
01:23:09,881 --> 01:23:11,922
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be a little bit more motivated to play that.

1036
01:23:12,422 --> 01:23:18,866
[SPEAKER_06]: All I'm going to say, I know you haven't seen Wreck-It Ralph yet, I'm not going to spoil it for you, but they need to make Sugar Rush a real game.

1037
01:23:19,066 --> 01:23:20,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they do.

1038
01:23:20,867 --> 01:23:23,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that was fucking outstanding.

1039
01:23:23,288 --> 01:23:24,889
[SPEAKER_02]: I would play the hell out of Sugar Rush.

1040
01:23:24,949 --> 01:23:30,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Wreck-It Ralph is in the new Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing game, Transformed.

1041
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:32,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I hope there's a track or something.

1042
01:23:32,833 --> 01:23:33,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Vanellope.

1043
01:23:33,553 --> 01:23:34,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Vanellope von Schweetz.

1044
01:23:35,569 --> 01:24:01,961
[SPEAKER_06]: which by the way there's actually a commercial for Sugar Rush oh yeah that was done as a sort of trailer for Wreck-It Ralph nice um talking about the arcade they're getting it in four quarters on your birthday I so want to say a quote from the ending and I can't say it because it's a spoiler but it's one of the like you got to know what I'm talking about I was laughing so hard it was the funniest thing in the movie like I'll tell you later off air I don't want to spoil it

1045
01:24:02,541 --> 01:24:05,363
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's spoil some Japanese release dates.

1046
01:24:05,643 --> 01:24:08,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you know that Japan is also getting Halo 4 this week?

1047
01:24:08,784 --> 01:24:11,086
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're getting some new Xbox 360s to come along with it.

1048
01:24:11,126 --> 01:24:14,087
[SPEAKER_06]: For all those Japanese Halo fans, there you go.

1049
01:24:14,327 --> 01:24:16,408
[SPEAKER_06]: Both of you guys can get that this week.

1050
01:24:17,509 --> 01:24:21,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Also coming out this week on the Xbox 360, Tropico 4 Gold Edition.

1051
01:24:21,111 --> 01:24:23,212
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's just a price reduction of an existing game.

1052
01:24:23,872 --> 01:24:26,033
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a re-release they're doing.

1053
01:24:26,333 --> 01:24:27,414
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the game with the expansion.

1054
01:24:28,893 --> 01:24:49,616
[SPEAKER_06]: on the Playstation 3 Silent Hill Downpour finally on the Playstation 3 in Japan this week Shin Sengoku Musou 6 Empires Hokuto Musou International getting a price reduction from Koei as well as a price reduction for Champion Jockey, G1 Jockey and Gallop Racer for those of you that like your horsey racing games in Japan

1055
01:24:50,096 --> 01:24:52,837
[SPEAKER_07]: and the really embarrassing Move integration.

1056
01:24:53,457 --> 01:24:54,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, is that the other big thing?

1057
01:24:55,097 --> 01:24:59,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember the one that looks like you're playing Final Furlong?

1058
01:24:59,379 --> 01:25:00,439
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Furlong, yeah.

1059
01:25:00,619 --> 01:25:01,759
[SPEAKER_06]: That game was amazing.

1060
01:25:01,859 --> 01:25:02,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Horse humping the game?

1061
01:25:03,460 --> 01:25:03,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1062
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:07,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Lastly, when do we get Wii U stuff in Japan?

1063
01:25:07,141 --> 01:25:07,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's right.

1064
01:25:07,541 --> 01:25:08,861
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't get it until December, huh?

1065
01:25:10,021 --> 01:25:11,802
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't start reading those release dates until December.

1066
01:25:13,263 --> 01:25:14,604
[SPEAKER_06]: How about the Nintendo 3DS?

1067
01:25:15,665 --> 01:25:31,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Another 3DS LL, which is basically their XL pack It's a Dobutsu no Mori pack, limited edition Because Tobidase Dobutsu no Mori comes out this week on the Nintendo 3DS And what is Dobutsu no Mori?

1068
01:25:32,057 --> 01:25:39,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Animal Forest, aka Animal Crossing That's right, Animal Crossing is the big release on the 3DS Technically that would be Animals Forest

1069
01:25:40,163 --> 01:25:43,909
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if Animal Crossing isn't your thing, maybe you're more into Jewel Pet.

1070
01:25:45,973 --> 01:25:51,416
[SPEAKER_06]: Mahou de Osare ni Dance Deco comes out this week as well on the 3DS.

1071
01:25:51,996 --> 01:26:00,860
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fantastic that the 3DS isn't region-free like the DS was because, you know, people then can't import games that they like to play.

1072
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:04,442
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be very hard to play Animal Crossing anyway because it's all in Japanese.

1073
01:26:04,522 --> 01:26:13,907
[SPEAKER_02]: I freaking tried on my Doubutsu no Mori for GameCube and even being... I read so slowly it takes an hour to do anything.

1074
01:26:14,369 --> 01:26:27,492
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you guys know this, but when the little characters read when they're talking, in the Japanese version of the game, they were saying the little Japanese syllables really quick, so it sounded like they were actually talking.

1075
01:26:27,872 --> 01:26:34,713
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the English version, you can't really do that same thing, so they would say the letters of the alphabet real fast.

1076
01:26:34,893 --> 01:26:40,314
[SPEAKER_02]: And see, that's why I wanted the Japanese one to play, because I thought it would help me with my listening comprehension.

1077
01:26:41,655 --> 01:26:41,875
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1078
01:26:42,315 --> 01:26:43,415
[SPEAKER_02]: It went way too fast.

1079
01:26:44,286 --> 01:26:46,047
[SPEAKER_06]: How about the UK, DarkSakura?

1080
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:48,629
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a few selections for the UK.

1081
01:26:48,889 --> 01:26:50,390
[SPEAKER_02]: On November 6th is Halo 4.

1082
01:26:51,191 --> 01:26:55,014
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 7th is Curiosity for iPhone, PC, Android, and iPad.

1083
01:26:56,735 --> 01:26:59,957
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope the cube contains eternal joy.

1084
01:27:01,018 --> 01:27:03,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Karateka for Xbox 360.

1085
01:27:05,514 --> 01:27:06,195
[SPEAKER_02]: When is the weekend?

1086
01:27:06,215 --> 01:27:07,056
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to get the cube?

1087
01:27:07,676 --> 01:27:08,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to know what's in the cube?

1088
01:27:08,717 --> 01:27:10,319
[SPEAKER_06]: Curiosity, what's in the fucking cube?

1089
01:27:10,479 --> 01:27:11,240
[SPEAKER_02]: What's in the box?

1090
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:12,921
[SPEAKER_06]: What's in the fucking box?

1091
01:27:12,941 --> 01:27:13,862
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell me what's in the box!

1092
01:27:13,922 --> 01:27:20,568
[SPEAKER_07]: I still have to update my iOS version, but I would like to pirate it just for the principle of the thing.

1093
01:27:21,445 --> 01:27:23,867
[SPEAKER_02]: On November 8th, we have Angry Birds Star Wars.

1094
01:27:25,628 --> 01:27:33,094
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 9th, Little Big Planet Karting and Mass Effect Trilogy, which I'm going to make my husband get me.

1095
01:27:34,635 --> 01:27:35,236
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.

1096
01:27:36,492 --> 01:27:41,036
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you did realize that LittleBigPlanet Karting is not coming on the Vita at launch.

1097
01:27:42,337 --> 01:27:46,100
[SPEAKER_06]: But if I buy it on the PS3, I'll still get my free Vita, right?

1098
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:47,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that part of the deal?

1099
01:27:47,662 --> 01:27:49,143
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't seen the sticker on the box.

1100
01:27:49,843 --> 01:27:54,848
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's on the box for the PlayStation All-Stars stuff, but at the same time, I don't really want that game.

1101
01:27:55,308 --> 01:27:56,650
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not even going to sell that for me.

1102
01:27:56,830 --> 01:27:57,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

1103
01:27:57,369 --> 01:28:00,411
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, you know what I totally love about playing Mass Effect on the PC?

1104
01:28:00,551 --> 01:28:00,771
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1105
01:28:01,451 --> 01:28:04,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Is hacking the coalesced INI file to get other outfits.

1106
01:28:04,673 --> 01:28:06,734
[SPEAKER_06]: And you wonder why you can't get online in part three.

1107
01:28:06,814 --> 01:28:11,456
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I reinstalled the fucker and it wasn't working.

1108
01:28:11,636 --> 01:28:12,977
[SPEAKER_02]: So bite my booty.

1109
01:28:13,397 --> 01:28:13,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Reported.

1110
01:28:16,899 --> 01:28:19,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys.

1111
01:28:19,622 --> 01:28:21,644
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the classic game of the week.

1112
01:28:21,964 --> 01:28:23,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Back when games worked.

1113
01:28:23,986 --> 01:28:24,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1114
01:28:25,628 --> 01:28:31,153
[SPEAKER_07]: So yes, there's a patent firm, and I don't even know why these things exist, but whatever.

1115
01:28:31,993 --> 01:28:38,580
[SPEAKER_07]: A Texas company has filed a lawsuit against Wizards of the Coast.

1116
01:28:38,700 --> 01:28:43,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Or not against Wizards of the Coast, I guess Hasbro, who has the Magic of the Gathering online game.

1117
01:28:43,564 --> 01:28:47,468
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't even realize Hasbro does online games, but okay, I guess I got into video gaming.

1118
01:28:48,089 --> 01:28:50,331
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyways, so Magic of the Gathering online, um...

1119
01:28:52,132 --> 01:28:54,813
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been out there for a while now, 10 years.

1120
01:28:55,493 --> 01:29:04,036
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess this wildcat, Intellectual Property Holdings of Dallas, they're filing a lawsuit against them to get it taken offline.

1121
01:29:04,496 --> 01:29:11,898
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess they hold the patent for Unit Commander, which calls, I guess, the ultimate mercenary trading card game.

1122
01:29:12,698 --> 01:29:14,639
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're saying that it infringes on that.

1123
01:29:15,936 --> 01:29:26,400
[SPEAKER_07]: Which something tells me that they probably had Magic the Gathering out there for a lot longer than they've had the patent for Unit Commander.

1124
01:29:27,781 --> 01:29:32,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I might add is about as generic as their patent for said game.

1125
01:29:34,648 --> 01:29:34,988
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1126
01:29:35,248 --> 01:29:35,689
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

1127
01:29:37,870 --> 01:29:40,392
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see if they even... I don't think anything's really going to happen.

1128
01:29:40,492 --> 01:29:43,694
[SPEAKER_06]: Pat and Troll, what are you going to do?

1129
01:29:44,055 --> 01:29:47,517
[SPEAKER_06]: It really does astound me that Magic the Gathering is still going after all this time.

1130
01:29:47,597 --> 01:29:48,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty strong, you know?

1131
01:29:48,858 --> 01:29:50,880
[SPEAKER_06]: There was just a tournament here locally over the weekend.

1132
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:51,400
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you know that?

1133
01:29:52,401 --> 01:29:53,041
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't doubt it.

1134
01:29:53,181 --> 01:29:55,643
[SPEAKER_06]: People still play this like mad.

1135
01:29:55,703 --> 01:29:57,064
[SPEAKER_06]: And I still suck at it.

1136
01:29:59,172 --> 01:30:00,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Dragon Quest VII is being remade for the 3DS

1137
01:30:16,900 --> 01:30:18,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra

1138
01:30:42,522 --> 01:30:56,914
[SPEAKER_06]: that's rad very nice I really hope that comes out over here we'll see Dragon Quest 7 if you weren't aware it was originally released on the PlayStation 1 that was about 12 years ago it was released in the USA Dragon Warrior 7 yes it was

1139
01:30:58,115 --> 01:31:01,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't they finally go back to calling it Dragon Quest in the US with 8 though?

1140
01:31:01,539 --> 01:31:02,020
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought they did.

1141
01:31:03,161 --> 01:31:05,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, that's a PS2 game we need to go back and really beat.

1142
01:31:05,644 --> 01:31:06,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Dragon Quest 8 was so good.

1143
01:31:06,385 --> 01:31:09,649
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when the demo for that was like a big thing.

1144
01:31:10,871 --> 01:31:15,116
[SPEAKER_06]: So no word yet if that is coming here, but one can hope.

1145
01:31:16,943 --> 01:31:17,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Dragon Quest VII

1146
01:31:38,734 --> 01:31:42,920
[SPEAKER_06]: Bratz, play this game and then report me for calling you a brat.

1147
01:31:43,962 --> 01:31:45,164
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the classic game of the week.

1148
01:31:45,204 --> 01:31:46,806
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

1149
01:31:46,826 --> 01:31:47,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Spank your ass.

1150
01:31:48,869 --> 01:31:49,610
[SPEAKER_02]: It's GigaWink 2.

1151
01:31:51,073 --> 01:31:53,637
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm actually specifically referring to the Dreamcast version.

1152
01:31:54,212 --> 01:31:54,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Radiant Silvergun

1153
01:32:14,551 --> 01:32:14,951
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that?

1154
01:32:15,792 --> 01:32:22,858
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, the game was originally developed by Takumi and it came out on the Naomi arcade system.

1155
01:32:23,358 --> 01:32:25,500
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in 2001 it came out on the Dreamcast.

1156
01:32:27,201 --> 01:32:30,403
[SPEAKER_02]: It basically has like uber huge scores.

1157
01:32:30,463 --> 01:32:32,845
[SPEAKER_02]: It seriously is like the ego pumping score system.

1158
01:32:33,206 --> 01:32:34,747
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually score in the quintillions.

1159
01:32:34,987 --> 01:32:35,487
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you know that?

1160
01:32:37,269 --> 01:32:48,785
[SPEAKER_02]: On top of that, the good thing about it being a horizontal monitor is that taking it from arcade to the home version meant that you pretty much still got the arcade treatment.

1161
01:32:49,185 --> 01:32:53,952
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't have to worry about rotating your TV or anything on edge or any of that.

1162
01:32:54,632 --> 01:32:55,393
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura

1163
01:33:10,371 --> 01:33:14,113
[SPEAKER_02]: So you had a ton of different fighters.

1164
01:33:15,013 --> 01:33:17,695
[SPEAKER_02]: A good half of them actually were unlocked.

1165
01:33:18,235 --> 01:33:22,837
[SPEAKER_02]: You could have Kingfisher, Sparrow, Raven, Stork, and Albatross.

1166
01:33:23,157 --> 01:33:35,063
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you could have the Raijin, Purchka, Stranger, Carmine, and Wilderstand, which were from the first Giggling.

1167
01:33:36,451 --> 01:33:45,035
[SPEAKER_02]: The soundtrack was super awesome, and I even remembered when you could get the soundtrack, it came with the soundtrack for Mars Matrix, which is another game I probably should do.

1168
01:33:46,296 --> 01:33:47,797
[SPEAKER_02]: But the music is all orchestral.

1169
01:33:47,817 --> 01:33:49,578
[SPEAKER_02]: It should turn up a little bit if you want.

1170
01:33:54,781 --> 01:33:56,162
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a really great soundtrack.

1171
01:33:56,182 --> 01:33:59,683
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really, in the end, it's a shooter, yeah.

1172
01:34:00,603 --> 01:34:07,445
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's definitely one that people should check out, especially since the Dreamcast is still kind of around and kicking.

1173
01:34:08,286 --> 01:34:09,066
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's pretty.

1174
01:34:09,866 --> 01:34:19,570
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing about that, too, is that it's basically around... The gameplay itself is around the absorption and reflection type mechanics.

1175
01:34:19,750 --> 01:34:22,671
[SPEAKER_02]: It's huge boss fights, tons of enemies.

1176
01:34:23,451 --> 01:34:27,132
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, I wouldn't quite say it's a bullet hell as much as it is an enemy hell.

1177
01:34:28,152 --> 01:34:31,053
[SPEAKER_02]: But I love the level scrolling and the design.

1178
01:34:31,193 --> 01:34:37,755
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it adds another layer of depth even if it is a top-down type shooter.

1179
01:34:38,535 --> 01:34:40,796
[SPEAKER_02]: So, definitely worth playing.

1180
01:34:41,876 --> 01:34:45,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Alrighty, some Dreamcast love from DarkSakura this week in the Classic Game of the Week.

1181
01:34:45,637 --> 01:34:46,497
[SPEAKER_06]: It is Giga Wing 2.

1182
01:34:47,418 --> 01:34:47,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

1183
01:34:47,898 --> 01:34:48,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Worth the Dreamcast.

1184
01:34:50,518 --> 01:34:51,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice pick.

1185
01:34:52,861 --> 01:34:53,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1186
01:34:53,702 --> 01:34:59,248
[SPEAKER_06]: YYR in the chat room says, GigaWing2 is also the only shmup I know of that supports four simultaneous players.

1187
01:34:59,948 --> 01:35:00,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1188
01:35:01,505 --> 01:35:01,825
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1189
01:35:02,705 --> 01:35:04,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that is going to do it for Part A of our show.

1190
01:35:04,946 --> 01:35:05,546
[SPEAKER_06]: But don't go anywhere.

1191
01:35:05,586 --> 01:35:12,507
[SPEAKER_06]: There is plenty more Orange Launch Radio to come tonight, including the Fugle Question of the Week, some details on the Wii U's browser.

1192
01:35:12,567 --> 01:35:15,228
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be very interesting, as well as some other Nintendo details.

1193
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:18,649
[SPEAKER_06]: And Mega Man Wily Wars.

1194
01:35:18,969 --> 01:35:21,729
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't know about this game, it may have fallen off your radar.

1195
01:35:21,749 --> 01:35:22,449
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a new game.

1196
01:35:22,469 --> 01:35:23,510
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a game from many, many years ago.

1197
01:35:23,530 --> 01:35:24,430
[SPEAKER_06]: It was for the Genesis.

1198
01:35:24,910 --> 01:35:26,370
[SPEAKER_06]: It never came out in the U.S.

1199
01:35:27,190 --> 01:35:28,270
[SPEAKER_06]: until now.

1200
01:35:28,671 --> 01:35:30,511
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll be talking about that after the break.

1201
01:35:36,798 --> 01:35:45,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live at the Voice of Geeks Network, VOGnetwork.com with the 480th episode of our show.

1202
01:35:47,146 --> 01:35:52,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Possibly a different time for some of you tonight because there was that whole daylight savings that happened over the weekend.

1203
01:35:53,051 --> 01:35:55,573
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what they say, spring forward, fall back.

1204
01:35:55,633 --> 01:35:58,015
[SPEAKER_06]: So everybody got an extra hour of sleep last night.

1205
01:35:58,635 --> 01:35:59,156
[SPEAKER_02]: I needed it.

1206
01:35:59,476 --> 01:36:03,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if you were me, you got home at 4 in the morning instead of 5 in the morning.

1207
01:36:04,760 --> 01:36:10,266
[SPEAKER_06]: That was my lucky thing, but that's what I get for going to the Bay Area and staying out late and then driving home the same night.

1208
01:36:10,346 --> 01:36:10,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

1209
01:36:11,107 --> 01:36:14,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I had Starbucks and I wasn't feeling tired.

1210
01:36:15,672 --> 01:36:19,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Hooray, by the way, for Peppermint Mochas being back at Starbucks.

1211
01:36:19,616 --> 01:36:21,418
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess technically you can get those any time of the year.

1212
01:36:21,598 --> 01:36:22,639
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also get them sugar-free.

1213
01:36:22,918 --> 01:36:40,118
[SPEAKER_06]: but yeah they have the skinny ones now which is great but you know what they don't have yet is the gingerbread lattes and those are amazing anyway it's not a coffee cast it's a video game cast it's just you know coffee is sometimes how we get through the day we will get back to video games Rob coffee is how I get through my life

1214
01:36:41,159 --> 01:36:44,162
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want to mention the elections are this week, you might have heard.

1215
01:36:44,262 --> 01:36:46,324
[SPEAKER_06]: So, of course, if you live in the U.S.

1216
01:36:46,524 --> 01:36:50,047
[SPEAKER_06]: or, you know, a country that lets you vote, you probably should vote.

1217
01:36:50,868 --> 01:36:52,530
[SPEAKER_06]: It is your right after all.

1218
01:36:52,870 --> 01:36:56,513
[SPEAKER_06]: And remember, you do not get to bitch about the results if you do not vote.

1219
01:36:56,813 --> 01:37:02,038
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, for one, can't wait for those frickin' election calls to stop calling me on my phone every ten minutes.

1220
01:37:02,378 --> 01:37:06,142
[SPEAKER_02]: I did, however, get to call Dan Lundgren a dick.

1221
01:37:06,702 --> 01:37:07,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Or he would hear it.

1222
01:37:08,476 --> 01:37:09,156
[SPEAKER_06]: Smart Glass Member

1223
01:37:29,745 --> 01:37:33,146
[SPEAKER_07]: We knew that Forza Horizon was going to use smart glass, but it kind of wasn't.

1224
01:37:33,327 --> 01:37:34,767
[SPEAKER_07]: So now it is.

1225
01:37:35,127 --> 01:37:42,670
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they've got some really cool stuff with that, including an in-game map that you can use, which is kind of cool.

1226
01:37:42,930 --> 01:37:48,753
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess it allows you to do all the same stuff that you can do by pausing the game, but now without pausing the game.

1227
01:37:48,793 --> 01:37:51,474
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can set destination GPSs and all that stuff.

1228
01:37:53,479 --> 01:37:54,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Might be kind of cool.

1229
01:37:54,501 --> 01:37:55,785
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd have to check that out, I guess.

1230
01:37:56,427 --> 01:37:58,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Forza looks like it might be fun.

1231
01:37:58,573 --> 01:37:59,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Have to ask Bobby if he's tried it yet.

1232
01:38:00,625 --> 01:38:02,746
[SPEAKER_06]: He did a review at vognetwork.com.

1233
01:38:02,806 --> 01:38:03,686
[SPEAKER_06]: He would tell you to go read.

1234
01:38:04,006 --> 01:38:06,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I understand that, but I meant about the smart glass thing.

1235
01:38:06,126 --> 01:38:06,926
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the smart glass.

1236
01:38:07,046 --> 01:38:07,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I don't know about that.

1237
01:38:09,447 --> 01:38:11,667
[SPEAKER_06]: He's busy with the football stuff.

1238
01:38:13,148 --> 01:38:14,408
[SPEAKER_06]: I played the demo for Forza.

1239
01:38:14,488 --> 01:38:18,549
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't do the smart glass thing because I don't think that's in the demo, but I like the demo.

1240
01:38:19,269 --> 01:38:20,429
[SPEAKER_06]: I might pick up the game.

1241
01:38:20,729 --> 01:38:21,070
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1242
01:38:21,130 --> 01:38:23,150
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like there's just so much right now that...

1243
01:38:23,490 --> 01:38:25,891
[SPEAKER_07]: I have that racing wheel, man, that's been collecting dust.

1244
01:38:26,191 --> 01:38:30,211
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of need to use that, so I may have to pick it up to try that.

1245
01:38:31,572 --> 01:38:33,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.

1246
01:38:33,292 --> 01:38:35,953
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, something that's kind of cool, that Shootmania Storm.

1247
01:38:36,033 --> 01:38:40,714
[SPEAKER_07]: I was kind of a fan of Trackmania, and so now they're getting into the other type of games.

1248
01:38:41,274 --> 01:38:45,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Shootmania being their kind of first-person shooter arena battle game.

1249
01:38:45,995 --> 01:38:52,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, I mean, one of the things about the whole Mania series is that you can customize everything, including the game types and all that.

1250
01:38:52,916 --> 01:39:20,159
[SPEAKER_07]: and share those so it is going to be I guess coming soon in a beta form and that'll be out in December and then the game is expected to arrive on January 23rd which is going to be kind of cool and I guess the beta is going to also have like you know welcome build they're going to have a couple new game modes and stuff like one they mentioned is laser jump and wall jump and grappling hook and

1251
01:39:21,019 --> 01:39:25,141
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't help but think, but looking at this stuff, it'd be kind of cool as like a 3D laser tag game.

1252
01:39:25,661 --> 01:39:26,982
[SPEAKER_07]: That might be pretty awesome.

1253
01:39:27,802 --> 01:39:28,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you and laser tag.

1254
01:39:29,123 --> 01:39:30,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking love laser tag.

1255
01:39:30,063 --> 01:39:31,564
[SPEAKER_06]: When was the last time you went to like a QZAR?

1256
01:39:31,964 --> 01:39:32,624
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a while.

1257
01:39:32,985 --> 01:39:33,445
[SPEAKER_06]: That's too bad.

1258
01:39:33,625 --> 01:39:35,066
[SPEAKER_06]: I miss the QZARs.

1259
01:39:35,866 --> 01:39:38,267
[SPEAKER_06]: They still have that one in Vacaville, which is like the closest one, sadly.

1260
01:39:39,116 --> 01:39:43,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think they do, but it's just kind of... It's a sad shadow of its former self.

1261
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:44,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

1262
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:49,123
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the next closest one's in Concord, or Pleasanton.

1263
01:39:50,785 --> 01:39:51,085
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1264
01:39:52,489 --> 01:39:53,150
[SPEAKER_06]: VACAVILLE NUT TREE

1265
01:40:16,894 --> 01:40:17,955
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1266
01:40:36,553 --> 01:40:37,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

1267
01:40:52,960 --> 01:41:16,572
[SPEAKER_07]: and the it was six six cents was the um company that made the original stuff it's uh 20 new test chambers that you can play and i guess they have new cubes that you can you know adjust the size of and you can also move portals around stuff and rotate objects using the move controller that might be fun i have portal too and i do have a move that i'm not using so maybe maybe

1268
01:41:18,544 --> 01:41:19,045
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1269
01:41:37,784 --> 01:41:47,438
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, a lot of people are waiting for the PlayStation debut of the original Mass Effect, which of course will be in the trilogy, or you'll also be able to get it on the PlayStation Network.

1270
01:41:47,659 --> 01:41:48,360
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to set you back $15.

1271
01:41:48,620 --> 01:41:51,364
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also... Excuse me.

1272
01:41:53,107 --> 01:41:53,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sneezing.

1273
01:41:53,708 --> 01:41:54,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Radio guy's worst enemy.

1274
01:41:55,991 --> 01:41:59,374
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also some detail on the DLC that's going to be included with the trilogy.

1275
01:42:00,175 --> 01:42:02,578
[SPEAKER_06]: All the Cerberus Network with Mass Effect 2, of course.

1276
01:42:03,259 --> 01:42:09,126
[SPEAKER_06]: On the PlayStation 3, though, you're going to get Lair of the Shadow Broker, Kasumi, which is what you need most of all.

1277
01:42:10,407 --> 01:42:11,048
[SPEAKER_06]: And Overlord.

1278
01:42:11,728 --> 01:42:12,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you get Zaid?

1279
01:42:12,728 --> 01:42:14,669
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't say Zaid, and it doesn't say Arrival.

1280
01:42:15,429 --> 01:42:16,989
[SPEAKER_06]: So you don't get all of the PlayStation 3.

1281
01:42:17,049 --> 01:42:20,230
[SPEAKER_02]: Arrival was really necessary to the story, I think.

1282
01:42:20,250 --> 01:42:22,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if they can get another ten bucks out of you, though.

1283
01:42:22,790 --> 01:42:25,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Mass Effect 3 will have Cerberus Network, but not Leviathan.

1284
01:42:26,511 --> 01:42:31,692
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm assuming it will have the multiplayer and all that good stuff, so that's one of the best features that keeps it going.

1285
01:42:32,212 --> 01:42:32,792
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

1286
01:42:33,452 --> 01:42:34,772
[SPEAKER_06]: December 4th on the PlayStation 3.

1287
01:42:35,272 --> 01:42:37,453
[SPEAKER_06]: And I kind of want it.

1288
01:42:38,713 --> 01:42:41,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because I have the entire trilogy on 360.

1289
01:42:41,795 --> 01:42:43,296
[SPEAKER_06]: I have the entire trilogy on PC.

1290
01:42:43,396 --> 01:42:48,300
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I kind of owe it to myself to get the entire trilogy on PlayStation as well.

1291
01:42:48,340 --> 01:42:49,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you agree, Loki?

1292
01:42:49,620 --> 01:42:50,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you get my logic?

1293
01:42:50,721 --> 01:42:51,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you understand me?

1294
01:42:51,802 --> 01:42:51,942
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

1295
01:42:55,287 --> 01:42:57,448
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a Wreck-It Ralph iOS game.

1296
01:42:57,509 --> 01:43:00,510
[SPEAKER_06]: If you were a fan of the movie, maybe you'll be a fan of the iOS game.

1297
01:43:00,691 --> 01:43:04,993
[SPEAKER_06]: It includes Fix-It Felix Jr., which is the game that the movie's about.

1298
01:43:05,294 --> 01:43:07,075
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want to point out, though, Fix-It Felix Jr.

1299
01:43:07,095 --> 01:43:09,096
[SPEAKER_06]: is also a standalone app for free.

1300
01:43:09,797 --> 01:43:13,619
[SPEAKER_06]: This other app is 99 cents, and you can also get Sweet Climber.

1301
01:43:14,820 --> 01:43:17,462
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just inspired by Sugar Rush, but it's not a racing game.

1302
01:43:17,522 --> 01:43:19,083
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a bounce-up-the-game.

1303
01:43:19,763 --> 01:43:20,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless...

1304
01:43:41,913 --> 01:43:44,315
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it has arcade support because it's a twin stick shooter.

1305
01:43:45,716 --> 01:43:49,258
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also, I'll tell you, I downloaded it because it's only 99 cents.

1306
01:43:49,278 --> 01:43:49,659
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell?

1307
01:43:49,679 --> 01:43:50,339
[SPEAKER_06]: And I love the movie.

1308
01:43:51,060 --> 01:43:56,123
[SPEAKER_06]: There is also apparently Turbo Time is a game that's coming, but it's locked right now.

1309
01:43:56,163 --> 01:43:57,124
[SPEAKER_06]: It says coming soon.

1310
01:43:57,244 --> 01:43:59,946
[SPEAKER_06]: So there will be, it looks like a fourth game added into it.

1311
01:44:00,806 --> 01:44:03,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty cool if you're a fan of Wreck-It Ralph, the iOS games out there right now.

1312
01:44:05,008 --> 01:44:10,571
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a wedding in gaming this week, and this is a pretty good one for the gaming industry.

1313
01:44:11,371 --> 01:44:15,493
[SPEAKER_06]: John Romero and Brenda Brathwaite actually got married.

1314
01:44:15,533 --> 01:44:18,755
[SPEAKER_06]: This is actually last weekend, but just the news came out this week.

1315
01:44:19,575 --> 01:44:20,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Get this.

1316
01:44:20,776 --> 01:44:27,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Between the two of them, Doom, Wizardry, Quake, Commander Keen, Jagged Alliance, Wolfenstein 3D.

1317
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:35,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe this is why, wasn't she one of the two people behind that Kickstarter for the old school RPG or something like that?

1318
01:44:36,223 --> 01:44:37,544
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember.

1319
01:44:38,064 --> 01:44:40,785
[SPEAKER_07]: I think she was, and maybe that's why they closed down.

1320
01:44:40,825 --> 01:44:42,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Her name came up on the show recently.

1321
01:44:42,626 --> 01:44:46,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, maybe that's why they closed down the whole Kickstarter for that.

1322
01:44:46,728 --> 01:44:51,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they also established a social game studio together in 2010.

1323
01:44:51,990 --> 01:44:54,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Loot Drop was the studio that they co-founded together.

1324
01:44:55,852 --> 01:45:01,515
[SPEAKER_06]: They were married by id Software co-founder Tom Hall, which is pretty cute.

1325
01:45:02,556 --> 01:45:04,938
[SPEAKER_06]: And get this, DarkSakura, guess where they were married?

1326
01:45:06,439 --> 01:45:07,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Disneyland on the steamboat.

1327
01:45:11,562 --> 01:45:15,625
[SPEAKER_06]: And then for their honeymoon, they went to hell and killed demons.

1328
01:45:15,945 --> 01:45:16,386
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kidding.

1329
01:45:16,406 --> 01:45:16,946
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was fun.

1330
01:45:17,166 --> 01:45:17,767
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was fun.

1331
01:45:18,547 --> 01:45:19,528
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's move on.

1332
01:45:20,048 --> 01:45:20,929
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

1333
01:45:21,334 --> 01:45:22,255
[SPEAKER_02]: Some stuff.

1334
01:45:23,115 --> 01:45:23,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Things.

1335
01:45:24,196 --> 01:45:26,738
[SPEAKER_02]: How about some Ragnarok stuff?

1336
01:45:27,698 --> 01:45:32,301
[SPEAKER_02]: The developer for Ragnarok is working, and that's... God, I hate when my screen messes up like this.

1337
01:45:32,842 --> 01:45:39,206
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Kazuki Morishita, I believe, is working on a Nintendo 3DS title.

1338
01:45:39,806 --> 01:45:43,929
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not saying what it's going to be, but he works on Ragnarok, so hey.

1339
01:45:45,009 --> 01:45:45,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's more Ragnarok.

1340
01:45:47,285 --> 01:45:54,032
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, in more news, Treasure is working on a Nintendo 3DS exclusive.

1341
01:45:54,852 --> 01:45:57,735
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know if Treasure's behind it, it's going to be fucking weird.

1342
01:45:58,616 --> 01:45:59,116
[SPEAKER_02]: And pretty good.

1343
01:46:00,277 --> 01:46:00,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Weird and good.

1344
01:46:00,758 --> 01:46:01,499
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they did Gunstar Heroes.

1345
01:46:01,519 --> 01:46:02,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking weird, but pretty good.

1346
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:02,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1347
01:46:03,500 --> 01:46:06,023
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think Treasure's ever put out any crap, so...

1348
01:46:09,156 --> 01:46:20,047
[SPEAKER_02]: And then... Cypress Hills Shag loses $250 million at the Grand Theft Auto lawsuit.

1349
01:46:21,108 --> 01:46:21,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically...

1350
01:46:23,792 --> 01:46:31,015
[SPEAKER_02]: He said that his likeness and life story was used to create the character CJ in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

1351
01:46:32,255 --> 01:46:34,176
[SPEAKER_02]: And the judge said, no.

1352
01:46:35,076 --> 01:46:35,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, you lose.

1353
01:46:36,497 --> 01:46:37,217
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not pass, go.

1354
01:46:37,677 --> 01:46:38,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Lose $250 million.

1355
01:46:39,077 --> 01:46:41,418
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think he lost $250 million.

1356
01:46:41,438 --> 01:46:42,499
[SPEAKER_06]: He lost the ability to win.

1357
01:46:42,519 --> 01:46:46,520
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't win $250 million, but you can't lose what you didn't get.

1358
01:46:46,540 --> 01:46:47,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not pass, go.

1359
01:46:47,340 --> 01:46:48,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not collect $250 million.

1360
01:46:48,361 --> 01:46:49,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that and he had to pay for his court costs.

1361
01:46:50,421 --> 01:46:51,222
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's probably out something.

1362
01:46:51,442 --> 01:46:52,082
[SPEAKER_06]: He's out something.

1363
01:46:53,519 --> 01:46:54,180
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know what I say?

1364
01:46:55,823 --> 01:46:58,488
[SPEAKER_06]: That whole lawsuit was insane in the membrane.

1365
01:46:59,990 --> 01:47:00,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Womp womp.

1366
01:47:01,413 --> 01:47:02,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's it.

1367
01:47:02,374 --> 01:47:02,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's it?

1368
01:47:02,815 --> 01:47:03,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1369
01:47:03,416 --> 01:47:05,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to the Fugle Question of the Week.

1370
01:47:14,082 --> 01:47:18,664
[SPEAKER_06]: Take the words Facebook and Google as in plus and slam them together and you get Fugle.

1371
01:47:18,704 --> 01:47:20,084
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's where this segment comes from.

1372
01:47:20,144 --> 01:47:23,906
[SPEAKER_06]: It's where we ask our fan communities a question and get their answers.

1373
01:47:24,566 --> 01:47:29,208
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, since everybody's talking about the movies, we had to make the Fugle question about Wreck-It Ralph.

1374
01:47:29,688 --> 01:47:34,050
[SPEAKER_06]: If the box office numbers are any indication, it looks like many of you saw Wreck-It Ralph this weekend.

1375
01:47:34,070 --> 01:47:35,030
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you think of the movie?

1376
01:47:35,511 --> 01:47:38,592
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it a great thing for video games or were you not happy with the way things were done?

1377
01:47:39,472 --> 01:47:42,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft starts us off on Google Plus saying, I loved it.

1378
01:47:42,113 --> 01:47:43,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything about it was great.

1379
01:47:43,574 --> 01:47:45,555
[SPEAKER_06]: The story, the cameos, the jokes, everything.

1380
01:47:45,695 --> 01:47:47,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone who hasn't seen this movie should do so.

1381
01:47:47,456 --> 01:47:47,916
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great.

1382
01:47:47,976 --> 01:47:49,717
[SPEAKER_06]: It truly surpasses the Disney standards.

1383
01:47:50,277 --> 01:47:51,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it a great thing for video games?

1384
01:47:52,098 --> 01:47:59,961
[SPEAKER_06]: That I really do not know since the movie only has references to games and such, but it isn't a real video game movie like Silent Hill, for example.

1385
01:48:00,421 --> 01:48:02,822
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a story set in a video game universe.

1386
01:48:03,203 --> 01:48:08,085
[SPEAKER_06]: But maybe it'll get people interested in retro gaming since most of the references are really from the old days of gaming.

1387
01:48:09,486 --> 01:48:13,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Elliot B answers the question on Google and says, I was really excited about seeing it.

1388
01:48:13,389 --> 01:48:14,330
[SPEAKER_06]: The trailer looked great.

1389
01:48:14,871 --> 01:48:18,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I realized it's not out until February here in the UK.

1390
01:48:18,914 --> 01:48:21,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's something that I want to just pose a question.

1391
01:48:21,657 --> 01:48:24,640
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think there are kids growing up nowadays that don't know what an arcade is?

1392
01:48:26,502 --> 01:48:42,987
[SPEAKER_06]: you know one thing I will fault the movie for is that it was a little you did have to suspend disbelief that people were lining up at the arcade to get in when they'd open it in the morning and that it was as full as it looked because you and I and she all know that arcades don't look like that anymore unfortunately unless there's a water park attached

1393
01:48:43,539 --> 01:48:44,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right.

1394
01:48:44,660 --> 01:48:48,682
[SPEAKER_06]: So that you did have to suspend disbelief for a little bit.

1395
01:48:48,762 --> 01:48:51,303
[SPEAKER_06]: But are there kids growing up today that don't know what an arcade is?

1396
01:48:52,084 --> 01:48:56,046
[SPEAKER_06]: No, because kids still have birthday parties at Chuck E. Cheese and Dave and Buster, well, or whatever.

1397
01:48:56,586 --> 01:48:57,587
[SPEAKER_06]: All those types of places.

1398
01:48:58,247 --> 01:49:00,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Bounce houses have arcades in them.

1399
01:49:00,468 --> 01:49:01,489
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all ticket redemption.

1400
01:49:02,029 --> 01:49:06,851
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a few arcade games in there, but most of it's Ticket Redemption.

1401
01:49:06,931 --> 01:49:08,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Disneyland still has arcades.

1402
01:49:09,092 --> 01:49:21,258
[SPEAKER_06]: There's arcades around, but it's just a lot of them tend to be the dollar experiences and they're driving games or gun games or whatever.

1403
01:49:21,338 --> 01:49:24,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Just very few of the Fix-It Felix Jr.

1404
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:28,481
[SPEAKER_06]: type of games, which clearly was inspired by Donkey Kong and that type of stuff.

1405
01:49:28,581 --> 01:49:29,862
[SPEAKER_06]: That type of experience...

1406
01:49:30,402 --> 01:49:35,663
[SPEAKER_06]: doesn't really exist anymore except maybe in the corner to get little use out of those old games.

1407
01:49:37,944 --> 01:49:40,424
[SPEAKER_06]: So Elliot wants to know he went and saw Skyfall instead.

1408
01:49:41,044 --> 01:49:44,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Now see, Skyfall is not here until this week and I really want to see it.

1409
01:49:46,226 --> 01:49:47,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan's been pissing himself over it.

1410
01:49:47,826 --> 01:49:51,567
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually really like James Bond movies so I'm kind of excited about Skyfall.

1411
01:49:51,607 --> 01:49:52,587
[SPEAKER_02]: And Craig is pretty...

1412
01:49:53,286 --> 01:49:54,026
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a great Bond.

1413
01:49:54,166 --> 01:49:54,626
[SPEAKER_02]: He's great.

1414
01:49:54,846 --> 01:49:55,646
[SPEAKER_02]: I love his eyes.

1415
01:49:56,587 --> 01:49:58,127
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll be even better as Indiana Jones.

1416
01:49:59,987 --> 01:50:02,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Next up, E3VL.

1417
01:50:02,428 --> 01:50:04,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm guessing that's Evel on Google+.

1418
01:50:04,988 --> 01:50:09,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Loved the video game nostalgia, especially those happening in the background and emotional spikes.

1419
01:50:09,909 --> 01:50:12,089
[SPEAKER_06]: This film was like the Roger Rabbit of video games.

1420
01:50:12,509 --> 01:50:18,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Seems like the movie panders way too much to the old gen gamers, 20 plus years old, with the video game references.

1421
01:50:18,550 --> 01:50:22,271
[SPEAKER_06]: Younger audiences may feel bored if it weren't for the sugar rush game and level puns.

1422
01:50:22,991 --> 01:50:30,356
[SPEAKER_06]: If you bring your kids, prepare for them to be confused and saddened in certain segments and jump for joy after wiped tears as its problems are resolved.

1423
01:50:31,116 --> 01:50:37,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, without spoiling too much though, the sugar rush thing kind of made up the majority of the movie.

1424
01:50:37,300 --> 01:50:42,504
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't think kids, I don't think the references would be, I mean there's a lot of references that are going to go over the kids' heads.

1425
01:50:42,864 --> 01:50:47,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Like in the baddie video game, which is in the trailer, I'm not spoiling anything.

1426
01:50:48,027 --> 01:51:01,900
[SPEAKER_06]: The Little League of Villains Batty Recovery Group Like, kids will just get that they're villains They'll get Zunkief They'll get Bison Maybe But they're not I think they'll get Pac-Man as well Why did

1427
01:51:03,121 --> 01:51:08,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Why did... There's a very obvious reference to Kano from Mortal Kombat.

1428
01:51:08,348 --> 01:51:09,149
[SPEAKER_02]: That is Kano.

1429
01:51:09,209 --> 01:51:09,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

1430
01:51:09,609 --> 01:51:10,951
[SPEAKER_06]: A very, very obvious reference.

1431
01:51:11,271 --> 01:51:12,673
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think kids are going to get it.

1432
01:51:12,753 --> 01:51:14,375
[SPEAKER_02]: The zombie is from House of the Dead.

1433
01:51:14,415 --> 01:51:15,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but adults get it.

1434
01:51:15,837 --> 01:51:17,659
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know who the purple rhino was?

1435
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:19,301
[SPEAKER_02]: The embossed Maldred Beast.

1436
01:51:20,202 --> 01:51:21,524
[SPEAKER_06]: With the fancy unicorns.

1437
01:51:21,860 --> 01:51:23,642
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1438
01:51:42,697 --> 01:51:44,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's go to Facebook because we had some good answers on Facebook.

1439
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:32,786
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree and I don't agree with you I think there's the potential to do other movies in this universe that's been established but I kind of draw the line at the Captain N thing remember, Mario's not in this movie because if Mario had been in the movie it would have been about Mario and the movie's not about the existing video game characters all the existing video game characters play supporting roles and that's what's really cool about it but Nintendo, a Captain N video game would be pretty awesome

1440
01:52:33,286 --> 01:52:35,708
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Captain N was absolute shit.

1441
01:52:36,309 --> 01:52:39,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they could fix all the wrongs, you know, all the 80s weird stuff.

1442
01:52:39,392 --> 01:52:41,734
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, like Simon Belmont being all weird and stuff.

1443
01:52:41,774 --> 01:52:44,056
[SPEAKER_07]: But if they fix all that, it could be pretty cool.

1444
01:52:44,476 --> 01:52:46,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Xenocorn, our chatroom, agrees with you, by the way.

1445
01:52:46,458 --> 01:52:47,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Live.VogNetwork.com.

1446
01:52:47,559 --> 01:52:49,401
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, Captain N, the hell you say.

1447
01:52:49,461 --> 01:52:50,642
[SPEAKER_06]: We can do better than Captain N.

1448
01:52:51,050 --> 01:52:51,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Mega high.

1449
01:52:53,352 --> 01:52:58,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Osfer says, honestly, I think Wreck-It Ralph did do well due to it being a Pixar film.

1450
01:52:59,295 --> 01:53:00,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, I got fooled, buddy.

1451
01:53:00,596 --> 01:53:01,216
[SPEAKER_06]: He got fooled.

1452
01:53:01,537 --> 01:53:02,877
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like a Pixar film.

1453
01:53:02,917 --> 01:53:03,238
[SPEAKER_06]: It was.

1454
01:53:03,638 --> 01:53:04,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at the opening.

1455
01:53:04,619 --> 01:53:06,200
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Disney Classic Studio.

1456
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:10,042
[SPEAKER_02]: But it did have the Pixar logo right at the top.

1457
01:53:10,943 --> 01:53:27,286
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was produced by Lasseter It was produced by one of the Pixar guys Although technically it's in the same This is the same studio that did Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and more recently Tangled Which is a very similar film, also not Pixar But it was produced by Lasseter

1458
01:53:27,426 --> 01:53:28,146
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, so.

1459
01:53:28,746 --> 01:53:35,288
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's just, you know, this is where Disney, having bought Pixar, this is where you're really starting to see the fruits of them coming together.

1460
01:53:35,608 --> 01:53:41,149
[SPEAKER_06]: But Brave was the Pixar film from this year, and Monsters 3, Monsters U or whatever is their big movie next year.

1461
01:53:42,770 --> 01:53:47,431
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the next Disney movie, the Disney classic movie next year is The Frozen.

1462
01:53:47,511 --> 01:53:47,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1463
01:53:47,791 --> 01:53:48,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, so.

1464
01:53:49,672 --> 01:54:05,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, continuing on with Osfer's comment I'm not calling you out or anything I'm just saying you made a mistake a lot of people are making And Pixar movies are great Maybe that was intentional There really is not a bad Pixar movie Unless it was a sequel to a mediocre one

1465
01:54:06,449 --> 01:54:12,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, those are usually the most hyped up films and it's rare to turn on the TV without seeing an ad for the movie.

1466
01:54:12,491 --> 01:54:16,612
[SPEAKER_06]: It's my opinion that the movie that truly did well for video games went overlooked.

1467
01:54:17,112 --> 01:54:24,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Silent Hill Revelation was the closest video game to film adaptation I've ever seen and future video game related movies could learn from it.

1468
01:54:25,194 --> 01:54:25,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Which reminds me.

1469
01:54:26,194 --> 01:54:27,014
[SPEAKER_06]: We still need to go see it.

1470
01:54:27,834 --> 01:54:29,095
[SPEAKER_02]: I have another friend that wants to see it too.

1471
01:54:29,475 --> 01:54:29,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1472
01:54:30,015 --> 01:54:30,215
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1473
01:54:30,976 --> 01:54:32,317
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll try to make that happen this week.

1474
01:54:32,837 --> 01:54:36,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I can't really respond to that because I haven't seen Silent Hill Revelation still.

1475
01:54:37,419 --> 01:54:38,179
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on my radar.

1476
01:54:38,219 --> 01:54:39,600
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to get that seen this week.

1477
01:54:40,440 --> 01:54:42,661
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll have to come back to that next week.

1478
01:54:44,708 --> 01:54:56,480
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have seen it if I had power, but wanted to wonder if anyone else noticed how some reviewers were comparing this to Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and that you saw multiple characters from different franchises in the same movie.

1479
01:54:56,860 --> 01:55:05,149
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I didn't think I liked that comparison at first, but now I think I do, because again, in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, none of those characters were the star.

1480
01:55:06,090 --> 01:55:08,152
[SPEAKER_06]: Roger Rabbit, Eddie, and Jessica Rabbit

1481
01:55:24,306 --> 01:55:28,469
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, moving on to DarkCharger who says, I saw this with my young son yesterday.

1482
01:55:28,949 --> 01:55:31,530
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great video game movie and a good movie overall.

1483
01:55:31,911 --> 01:55:41,396
[SPEAKER_06]: While it doesn't belong in the pantheon of animated films, it is a great love letter to every sort of gamer, especially to those that live through the golden age of the arcade who may enjoy this film even more.

1484
01:55:41,977 --> 01:55:48,581
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that it drives strength in its narrative by not simply focusing on video games, but by not forgetting about the characters.

1485
01:55:49,021 --> 01:55:49,701
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a pretty good review.

1486
01:55:51,212 --> 01:55:52,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Chiggers replied and said, I really liked Wreck-It Ralph.

1487
01:55:53,033 --> 01:55:57,917
[SPEAKER_02]: My only complaint is that I wish they would have had more of the other classic game characters had more of a role.

1488
01:55:58,037 --> 01:56:01,099
[SPEAKER_06]: I respect their decision to not do that because I think it would have taken away...

1489
01:56:18,171 --> 01:56:33,105
[SPEAKER_06]: it was very interesting to me that one of the media supporting roles went to and again I don't think this is spoiling anything I think I'm okay saying this one of the media supporting roles went to Qbert because Qbert's one of those characters where it's like he's not

1490
01:56:34,289 --> 01:56:43,283
[SPEAKER_06]: A Mario or a Sonic per se, but he's very recognizable if you were alive in the 80s or if you have a knowledge of 80s gaming.

1491
01:56:43,624 --> 01:56:44,165
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

1492
01:56:44,725 --> 01:56:49,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, did you kind of feel that way, Jamie, that that was a very interesting character to have be a supporting character?

1493
01:56:49,313 --> 01:56:49,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1494
01:56:50,494 --> 01:56:51,014
[SPEAKER_06]: But it worked.

1495
01:56:51,955 --> 01:56:53,136
[SPEAKER_06]: So, anyhow.

1496
01:56:55,077 --> 01:56:56,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, moving on.

1497
01:56:56,538 --> 01:56:57,319
[SPEAKER_06]: TheRobD says,

1498
01:57:10,089 --> 01:57:17,070
[SPEAKER_06]: As a lifelong gamer, I find it refreshing to see them treated as the creative medium and source of enjoyment for so many that they are.

1499
01:57:17,490 --> 01:57:20,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Not something that only nerds and basement dwellers partake in.

1500
01:57:20,891 --> 01:57:22,371
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, the bottom line is this.

1501
01:57:22,791 --> 01:57:26,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Wreck-It Ralph treats both video games and gamers with respect.

1502
01:57:26,492 --> 01:57:32,473
[SPEAKER_06]: The people who created it did a wonderful job of capturing the joy of games and the world's Wii gamers experience.

1503
01:57:32,793 --> 01:57:36,074
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the first time that's ever happened and they should be lauded for it.

1504
01:57:36,514 --> 01:57:39,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hope that this is the start of a trend and not an aberration.

1505
01:57:39,836 --> 01:57:41,737
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a very solid comment.

1506
01:57:41,757 --> 01:57:42,277
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.

1507
01:57:43,758 --> 01:57:45,779
[SPEAKER_06]: One more comment here from Degenerate Johnny.

1508
01:57:46,539 --> 01:57:48,240
[SPEAKER_06]: This is also a very interesting comment.

1509
01:57:48,260 --> 01:57:53,102
[SPEAKER_06]: I like this one a lot, and this is the last one I'm going to read here from Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

1510
01:57:53,723 --> 01:58:01,126
[SPEAKER_06]: Degenerate Johnny says, I will admit that the movie was quite entertaining, and I think that it places video games in a better light, which is something the industry needs.

1511
01:58:01,547 --> 01:58:05,669
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I'm not sure if Wreck-It Ralph is a good thing for the progression of video games.

1512
01:58:06,229 --> 01:58:12,191
[SPEAKER_06]: The industry has grown up considerably since its inception, but it is still considered by many media outlets i.e.

1513
01:58:12,271 --> 01:58:14,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Fox News and CNN as a child's toy.

1514
01:58:15,512 --> 01:58:23,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Therefore, having a successful family-friendly video game movie may be a form of support to those who heavily criticize the industry for its violent games.

1515
01:58:23,914 --> 01:58:30,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Interactive entertainment is the entertainment of this age, as was motion pictures the entertainment of the industrial age.

1516
01:58:30,675 --> 01:58:37,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, I don't think that it's fair to interpret an entertainment industry based on its interactions with other forms of entertainment.

1517
01:58:38,016 --> 01:58:44,357
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't interpret William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet through that horrid excuse of a movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio.

1518
01:58:44,698 --> 01:58:47,638
[SPEAKER_06]: The views and opinions of OLR's fans do not reflect that of OLR.

1519
01:58:47,938 --> 01:58:48,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn right they don't.

1520
01:58:48,778 --> 01:58:49,518
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that movie.

1521
01:58:49,778 --> 01:58:50,298
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

1522
01:58:50,499 --> 01:58:53,099
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate that play so much because they're both stupid.

1523
01:58:53,738 --> 01:58:56,580
[SPEAKER_06]: I do agree there's better Shakespeare plays than Romeo and Juliet, for sure.

1524
01:58:56,800 --> 01:58:57,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

1525
01:58:57,081 --> 01:58:57,681
[SPEAKER_02]: The theme of that?

1526
01:58:58,001 --> 01:58:58,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, we're stupid.

1527
01:58:58,842 --> 01:58:59,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's kill each other.

1528
01:58:59,562 --> 01:58:59,943
[SPEAKER_02]: The end.

1529
01:59:00,843 --> 01:59:09,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Wreck-It Ralph was simply a fun-filled children's movie that I hope to God will only be viewed as such if interactive entertainment is to be accepted as the next form of entertainment.

1530
01:59:10,510 --> 01:59:14,793
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that was a very interesting comment because of the whole... And this is the part that really got me.

1531
01:59:15,474 --> 01:59:21,118
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's fair to interpret an entertainment industry based on its interactions with other forms of entertainment.

1532
01:59:21,778 --> 01:59:23,019
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think about that statement?

1533
01:59:23,239 --> 01:59:25,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think that's a good statement that he's making there?

1534
01:59:26,280 --> 01:59:37,686
[SPEAKER_06]: It does seem like gamers, especially in gaming blogs and the things we read on the internet, it does seem like gamers are really obsessed with how does the news report on us?

1535
01:59:38,167 --> 01:59:40,248
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we get portrayed in movies?

1536
01:59:40,868 --> 01:59:44,430
[SPEAKER_06]: It does seem like that always piques a curiosity.

1537
01:59:44,990 --> 01:59:46,791
[SPEAKER_06]: I just thought it was a neat way of looking at it.

1538
01:59:46,831 --> 01:59:46,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

1539
02:00:07,992 --> 02:00:11,173
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very kind of, it actually strikes me as somewhat abstract.

1540
02:00:12,173 --> 02:00:12,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?

1541
02:00:12,553 --> 02:00:30,338
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you look at taking one genre and portraying it in another genre, then any type of biography about artists, about, shoot, toy story, toys coming to life and doing stuff.

1542
02:00:31,974 --> 02:00:32,655
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1543
02:00:50,051 --> 02:00:54,114
[SPEAKER_06]: because silent movies were way different than movies today.

1544
02:00:54,174 --> 02:01:03,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell, even when there was silent movies, you needed the piano guy sitting there at the front playing, you know, those two industries have always really needed each other.

1545
02:01:03,740 --> 02:01:06,482
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of the best music was inspired by movies.

1546
02:01:07,263 --> 02:01:12,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Or have you, well, music just goes with some, like, here's going to be a really dumb example.

1547
02:01:13,267 --> 02:01:15,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever written California Screamin' without the soundtrack?

1548
02:01:16,309 --> 02:01:17,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, when my chair was broken.

1549
02:01:18,706 --> 02:01:20,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it not a little different?

1550
02:01:20,107 --> 02:01:21,207
[SPEAKER_06]: It was not as good.

1551
02:01:21,467 --> 02:01:21,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1552
02:01:22,388 --> 02:01:24,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Or changing the music and things.

1553
02:01:25,089 --> 02:01:32,773
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I really like how a lot of times for showing a suspenseful part in a movie or a game, they'll just use silence.

1554
02:01:33,814 --> 02:01:41,578
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of, they'll let you focus on the sounds going on, not just scary music to let you know it's scary.

1555
02:01:41,598 --> 02:01:41,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1556
02:01:44,340 --> 02:01:48,364
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, we'll end it on this comment in the chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

1557
02:01:48,745 --> 02:01:52,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Xenacore says, Rob, the answer to your question is porn.

1558
02:01:53,570 --> 02:01:56,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Robert M. also says that there are a lot of classic toys in Toy Story.

1559
02:01:58,976 --> 02:02:00,217
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what about...

1560
02:02:03,633 --> 02:02:03,973
[SPEAKER_02]: Books.

1561
02:02:04,673 --> 02:02:06,354
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we've kind of had The NeverEnding Story.

1562
02:02:06,834 --> 02:02:08,195
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that, The Pagemaster?

1563
02:02:08,455 --> 02:02:10,716
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, people were into that movie.

1564
02:02:10,896 --> 02:02:12,317
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to say it.

1565
02:02:13,097 --> 02:02:17,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Or even take comics.

1566
02:02:17,919 --> 02:02:21,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a different genre of story.

1567
02:02:21,260 --> 02:02:22,681
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, the whole Fable series.

1568
02:02:23,459 --> 02:02:25,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, you just really hit on something.

1569
02:02:25,541 --> 02:02:32,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Because something that's really huge now that wasn't as big years ago was the comics and movies.

1570
02:02:32,947 --> 02:02:34,648
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a huge thing in the industry now.

1571
02:02:34,768 --> 02:02:46,278
[SPEAKER_06]: And really, before the past few years, you would occasionally have Superman was huge in the 70s, and Batman was huge in the 90s, the Burton series.

1572
02:02:46,658 --> 02:02:50,321
[SPEAKER_06]: But comics are kind of big in movies now in a way where...

1573
02:02:50,501 --> 02:03:18,994
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't seen I have a reason to see Guardians of the Galaxy now Rocket Raccoon Anyway The whole reason I think with that and also why I think Wreck-It Ralph is doing well is that the audience the target audience being also the same age group of an audience that's going to have the money and maybe have kids but also be the people who are going to get it That's the ones you want to market to is our age demographic

1574
02:03:20,498 --> 02:03:27,651
[SPEAKER_02]: and on top of that, we grew up I grew up reading X-Men and Avengers, you know I didn't read DC because DC sucks

1575
02:03:30,138 --> 02:03:59,570
[SPEAKER_02]: um sorry my allergies my sinus infection is getting the best of me um but uh you know we grew up playing these games it's we are at the age that we are the ones with money and the influence not in the corporate world of course because that's bullshit Occupy um but uh as far as what dictates what's popular in pop culture in in modern popular culture we're the age group

1576
02:04:01,431 --> 02:04:04,053
[SPEAKER_06]: There are too many deep discussions happening on tonight's show.

1577
02:04:04,093 --> 02:04:04,894
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't understand.

1578
02:04:04,934 --> 02:04:05,975
[SPEAKER_06]: What is in the air tonight?

1579
02:04:06,035 --> 02:04:08,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Where am I taking fart jokes that I came here for?

1580
02:04:08,237 --> 02:04:08,797
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get it.

1581
02:04:09,418 --> 02:04:09,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry.

1582
02:04:10,058 --> 02:04:11,840
[SPEAKER_02]: My next story has raccoon penis in it.

1583
02:04:11,980 --> 02:04:12,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1584
02:04:12,821 --> 02:04:13,101
[SPEAKER_06]: Phew.

1585
02:04:13,221 --> 02:04:15,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, before we get to your story, then we got to do a couple more.

1586
02:04:15,723 --> 02:04:16,904
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's get back into some news.

1587
02:04:17,024 --> 02:04:21,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, we will be opening up the Skype line later if you want to call and voice your opinion on any of this.

1588
02:04:21,388 --> 02:04:25,371
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

1589
02:04:25,611 --> 02:04:26,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Loki.

1590
02:04:26,092 --> 02:04:27,573
[SPEAKER_06]: I needed to plug that before we get to that.

1591
02:04:27,853 --> 02:04:29,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a problem.

1592
02:04:29,274 --> 02:04:43,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Since a lot of the whole online plan for the Wii U has been kind of non-existent or hidden or secret or whatever, it is kind of refreshing to see that there's some information, including now what their web browser is going to be.

1593
02:04:43,364 --> 02:04:47,967
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if there's anything to really be excited about, but here we go.

1594
02:04:48,628 --> 02:04:56,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, it's based off the whole NetFront browser, which has been used in pretty much all the portable gaming systems.

1595
02:04:56,713 --> 02:04:56,914
[SPEAKER_07]: The

1596
02:04:57,614 --> 02:05:10,608
[SPEAKER_07]: DS, 3DS, PSP, Vita, and of course, you know, the Wii U. It's based a little bit off of, you know, they've got Mozilla kind of backing a little bit of the Apple WebKit as well.

1597
02:05:11,389 --> 02:05:16,134
[SPEAKER_07]: And then a little bit of, I guess, the Nintendo browser, which is good or bad.

1598
02:05:16,955 --> 02:05:23,104
[SPEAKER_07]: It will support HTML5, of course, no Flash, because everyone's kind of saying HTML5 is the way to go anyways.

1599
02:05:24,025 --> 02:05:29,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if we had Flash, we'd be able to play all of those virtual console games for free, and Nintendo has to know this.

1600
02:05:30,415 --> 02:05:31,196
[SPEAKER_06]: They have to know this.

1601
02:05:31,316 --> 02:05:31,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, of course.

1602
02:05:34,059 --> 02:05:38,582
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to support MP4 files as well as live streaming.

1603
02:05:40,644 --> 02:05:46,108
[SPEAKER_07]: MPEG-4 AVC video, the H.2.64 format.

1604
02:05:46,288 --> 02:05:47,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Although some may not be playable.

1605
02:05:48,009 --> 02:05:52,913
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, it will support just the regular level HTML4, 5...

1606
02:05:55,014 --> 02:06:03,597
[SPEAKER_07]: X, HTML 1.1, CSS 1, 2, or 2.1 and 3, although those are partially functioning, like S3 is partially functioning.

1607
02:06:04,417 --> 02:06:13,660
[SPEAKER_07]: And they say even like video web storage is partially functioning, web messaging and some other stuff there.

1608
02:06:16,332 --> 02:06:19,933
[SPEAKER_07]: No plugins, obviously, because it's built into the system there.

1609
02:06:20,734 --> 02:06:28,298
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess they're saying that the browser will support some touch event stuff, like a touch start, touch end, move, cancel.

1610
02:06:28,518 --> 02:06:30,799
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm assuming it's all the stuff that you would have with a touch patch.

1611
02:06:30,899 --> 02:06:31,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing.

1612
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:35,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Will it be fast and responsive and easy?

1613
02:06:35,744 --> 02:06:42,009
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the problem with so many of these browsers on the TV and all this stuff is that they run like shit.

1614
02:06:42,390 --> 02:06:45,513
[SPEAKER_06]: It's faster to just whip my phone out of my pocket and get what I need.

1615
02:06:45,653 --> 02:06:48,936
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they're saying right now that it's supposed to be, I guess...

1616
02:06:50,797 --> 02:07:08,382
[SPEAKER_07]: It does support HTML5, and I guess because it renders HTML5 websites more effectively than any other console, even faster than Internet Explorer, they're saying that it's pretty good, I guess?

1617
02:07:09,282 --> 02:07:09,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Html5 Test

1618
02:07:33,660 --> 02:07:35,481
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a gaming tab on there.

1619
02:07:36,061 --> 02:07:41,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, there's not a lot of gaming browsers that support HTML5.

1620
02:07:42,184 --> 02:07:44,065
[SPEAKER_07]: The 3DS and Xbox 360.

1621
02:07:44,165 --> 02:07:44,845
[SPEAKER_07]: The 3DS got a 109.

1622
02:07:45,025 --> 02:07:47,166
[SPEAKER_07]: The Xbox 360 is a 120.

1623
02:07:47,306 --> 02:07:51,007
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, of course, the other browsers right now.

1624
02:07:51,027 --> 02:07:52,788
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess Wii does support it a little bit.

1625
02:07:53,028 --> 02:07:54,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Wii's got a 94 and the DSi a 94.

1626
02:07:54,489 --> 02:07:55,389
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Vita, a 58.

1627
02:08:01,400 --> 02:08:26,288
[SPEAKER_07]: in the course right now they're saying although it lists the Vita again I guess for HTML5 maybe that's like HTML4 scores or something like that but for in the future or in development the Wii U a 323 and I guess the Vita is a 243 I'm assuming that's maybe an update or something so I don't know like I said where they're getting their information as far as how they're scoring that but

1628
02:08:28,977 --> 02:08:30,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting, I guess.

1629
02:08:31,299 --> 02:08:35,542
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to see if there's any other comparisons with tablets.

1630
02:08:35,622 --> 02:08:37,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so let's look at tablets real quick.

1631
02:08:38,464 --> 02:08:41,586
[SPEAKER_07]: And as you would expect, the tablets are better.

1632
02:08:42,727 --> 02:08:44,709
[SPEAKER_07]: The 323 is the Wii U's benchmark there.

1633
02:08:45,489 --> 02:08:49,272
[SPEAKER_07]: And right now, they have Opera Mobile 12.

1634
02:08:49,532 --> 02:08:49,752
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a 406.

1635
02:08:50,633 --> 02:08:51,133
[SPEAKER_07]: And Chrome's 390.

1636
02:08:51,173 --> 02:08:56,217
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to see what else would be the closest there.

1637
02:08:57,618 --> 02:09:21,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Even Windows Phone 8 is close, 320, iOS 6 is a 386, Firefox Mobile, 388 So it does sound like your phone is going to be better at rendering those pages But it's not as bad, even TVs are better at it But for gaming, out of gaming consoles, it is the best

1638
02:09:22,848 --> 02:09:32,957
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if that's really saying much, but when I can get my hands on it and try it, that's when I can't really say one way or the other.

1639
02:09:33,677 --> 02:09:35,619
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know where they're getting it.

1640
02:09:35,659 --> 02:09:38,621
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't say what they're testing.

1641
02:09:38,681 --> 02:09:45,087
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really know what they're testing and how they're even testing a system that's not out yet.

1642
02:09:46,678 --> 02:09:51,879
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I have some potpourri news involving Nintendo, and it means I have a few little things I want to get out here.

1643
02:09:52,879 --> 02:09:58,241
[SPEAKER_06]: One of them is about finally some details on what exactly the Nintendo Network Premium involves.

1644
02:09:59,041 --> 02:10:05,542
[SPEAKER_06]: You remember the Wii U Deluxe Edition that has Nintendo Land as a packing game also gets this whole Nintendo Network Premium.

1645
02:10:05,602 --> 02:10:07,083
[SPEAKER_06]: So what the hell is this all about?

1646
02:10:07,143 --> 02:10:13,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, basically, you get 10% back in points that you spend on the Wii U shop.

1647
02:10:13,604 --> 02:10:27,548
[SPEAKER_06]: so if you get the 32 gig Wii U with the game you get Nintendo Network Premium and you get 10% back in points if you buy a Wii U game on the eShop so let's say you buy a game for $59.99 10% of that's $5.99 points so there you go you get $5 in eShop credit for every 500 points

1648
02:10:33,209 --> 02:10:42,017
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically buying a game like New Super Mario Bros.

1649
02:10:42,577 --> 02:10:48,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii U online would get you enough points to buy the original Mario Bros.

1650
02:10:48,622 --> 02:10:52,826
[SPEAKER_06]: on the virtual console So a little something there

1651
02:10:53,326 --> 02:11:02,561
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very similar to what the Vita does already, where you get 10% off, but that 10% that you save is not tied to their store.

1652
02:11:02,781 --> 02:11:08,009
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just money in your pocket versus having this money be...

1653
02:11:08,690 --> 02:11:11,774
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, I don't see downloading games as kind of an option.

1654
02:11:11,854 --> 02:11:12,976
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1655
02:11:13,656 --> 02:11:20,244
[SPEAKER_07]: With how fickle I get with games and stuff like that, you would want to have the option to sell it back or something.

1656
02:11:20,705 --> 02:11:23,989
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not really much of an incentive, I guess.

1657
02:11:24,009 --> 02:11:24,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1658
02:11:24,870 --> 02:11:25,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Mario Bros.

1659
02:11:25,331 --> 02:11:25,931
[SPEAKER_06]: U Challenge Mode

1660
02:11:42,829 --> 02:11:48,790
[SPEAKER_06]: There's categories that include time attack, coin collection, one-up rally, and special, which is basically miscellaneous.

1661
02:11:49,190 --> 02:11:52,471
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also boost mode challenges that will require two players.

1662
02:11:52,971 --> 02:11:56,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Once you complete a challenge, a replay is saved so you can show that off.

1663
02:11:57,012 --> 02:12:05,274
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also coin battle, where up to four players will go through the course and see who can collect the most coins, not unlike the recent 3DS release.

1664
02:12:06,414 --> 02:12:35,243
[SPEAKER_06]: another player can use the Wii U gamepad in boost mode to place boost blocks to help grab a hard to reach coin you can use the gamepad to edit and customize the coin layout in dedicated courses that layout can then be saved and played by players using the Wii remote controllers at least that sounds kind of new and interesting I'm curious how that plays out coins everywhere world map

1665
02:12:36,345 --> 02:12:36,605
[SPEAKER_06]: NABBIT

1666
02:12:52,646 --> 02:13:00,633
[SPEAKER_06]: A creature named Nabbit from time to time will appear on the world map if you enter the course and catch Nabbit to recover items stolen from Toad.

1667
02:13:01,393 --> 02:13:06,738
[SPEAKER_06]: If you get Nabbit, you get a pea acorn which will allow you to fly continuously through an entire stage.

1668
02:13:06,758 --> 02:13:10,161
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm assuming that is like the pea wing from Mario 3.

1669
02:13:13,123 --> 02:13:20,769
[SPEAKER_06]: And one other thing, you know, Loki, you give Nintendo a lot of shit on this show, but you gotta applaud Nintendo for this comment this week.

1670
02:13:21,810 --> 02:13:35,175
[SPEAKER_06]: Satoru Iwata in talking about Animal Crossing New Leaf on the Nintendo 3DS mentioning all of the download content will be free because charging consumers for the DLC would not be cool.

1671
02:13:35,255 --> 02:13:40,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Quote, that sort of element, paid DLC, is absolutely not being added.

1672
02:13:40,777 --> 02:13:43,098
[SPEAKER_06]: He went so far as to call it unwholesome.

1673
02:13:43,638 --> 02:13:48,600
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically like, you know, they could have charged for new patterns and silly, they're not going to do it.

1674
02:13:50,020 --> 02:13:53,242
[SPEAKER_06]: They thought about it, but they decided not to do it.

1675
02:13:54,143 --> 02:13:56,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, Nintendo's biggest critic on this show.

1676
02:13:57,768 --> 02:14:23,984
[SPEAKER_07]: wasn't that the right call to make well yeah it's the the most common sense call to make and let's be honest the first party companies aren't really the ones that are being known for all this on disc content I don't think that Sony has a whole lot of games that kind of nickel and dime you for things and I don't think that Microsoft has any any similar games like that as well so cool you're on equal standing with everybody else third party companies well that's

1677
02:14:24,284 --> 02:14:24,844
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1678
02:14:43,160 --> 02:14:45,442
[SPEAKER_02]: What does raccoon penis have to do with video games?

1679
02:14:46,122 --> 02:14:53,027
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually has to do with a digital art group called Massive Black.

1680
02:14:53,887 --> 02:15:01,572
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've done a lot of concept art for Lord of the Rings Online, Infamous 2, Silent Hill Shattered Memories, and Transformers 3.

1681
02:15:02,933 --> 02:15:05,835
[SPEAKER_02]: They also developed their own game.

1682
02:15:05,875 --> 02:15:12,960
[SPEAKER_02]: They have an artistic demo out called Moth Head that they're using to show the Unity platform.

1683
02:15:14,421 --> 02:15:18,423
[SPEAKER_02]: I downloaded this because honestly I had heard of the art piece that it was based off of.

1684
02:15:19,123 --> 02:15:31,709
[SPEAKER_02]: It's based off of a sculpture that is, well, it has a giant phallus on it made from the real bone of a raccoon penis.

1685
02:15:33,129 --> 02:15:36,891
[SPEAKER_02]: And if no one believes me, I will pull up the image and show everybody.

1686
02:15:37,171 --> 02:15:38,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, no, I believe you.

1687
02:15:38,132 --> 02:15:38,472
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fine.

1688
02:15:39,592 --> 02:15:40,413
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com.

1689
02:16:06,988 --> 02:16:34,837
[SPEAKER_02]: it's actually supposed to be similar to and I'm going to mispronounce this as Botanicula I think it's still a demo I mean the controls aren't great I downloaded it it was originally conceived as a full length game and they still want to do it but right now it's sort of on hold while they finish their clients work because they still have huge groups that they're doing artwork for but

1690
02:16:36,511 --> 02:16:38,052
[SPEAKER_02]: It's absolutely gorgeous to me.

1691
02:16:38,132 --> 02:16:41,495
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I freaking love concept art.

1692
02:16:42,276 --> 02:16:49,781
[SPEAKER_02]: And just the fact that they would take this sculpture and turn it into a figure in a game just to sort of like combining two of my favorite things.

1693
02:16:50,422 --> 02:16:53,124
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, fine modern art and video games.

1694
02:16:53,204 --> 02:16:57,347
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll post the link of the image in the chat room.

1695
02:16:59,049 --> 02:16:59,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1696
02:17:01,130 --> 02:17:01,831
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on, Loki.

1697
02:17:01,851 --> 02:17:01,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1698
02:17:02,589 --> 02:17:14,094
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so, I don't know, we talked about, we talked a lot about a recent video, I don't even really call it a video game movie, but a video game based movie.

1699
02:17:15,935 --> 02:17:23,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about another one that probably won't turn out as well, and that would be Castle Wolfenstein, the movie.

1700
02:17:24,379 --> 02:17:29,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, they've got Roger Avery back on his role as the writer and director for the movie.

1701
02:17:30,642 --> 02:17:32,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Doom Level Skip

1702
02:17:54,648 --> 02:17:54,988
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1703
02:17:56,210 --> 02:17:59,032
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyways, their plot, if we must go back in there.

1704
02:17:59,413 --> 02:18:00,454
[SPEAKER_07]: A young U.S.

1705
02:18:00,754 --> 02:18:11,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Army captain and British special agent are on a top secret mission to Castle Wolfenstein where Hitler will be unveiling a new secret weapon.

1706
02:18:12,986 --> 02:18:13,987
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds awfully generic.

1707
02:18:14,067 --> 02:18:17,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Does this mean the Hitler robot that was the boss of one of the... I hope so.

1708
02:18:17,590 --> 02:18:17,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh boy.

1709
02:18:19,710 --> 02:18:21,732
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be, I think it could be dumb fun.

1710
02:18:22,252 --> 02:18:24,154
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as it we bowls not attached to it, which he is.

1711
02:18:24,234 --> 02:18:25,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Emphasis on dumb.

1712
02:18:26,637 --> 02:18:27,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1713
02:18:28,378 --> 02:18:30,280
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, I think this is kind of neat.

1714
02:18:30,380 --> 02:18:36,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, you know, Sega is no stranger to repackaging their old shit, and they've done it a lot, a lot.

1715
02:18:37,427 --> 02:18:45,735
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, the various collections, whether it be download, PC, or these little hook them up directly to your TV things, right?

1716
02:18:47,135 --> 02:18:49,156
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a new one on the way out.

1717
02:18:49,236 --> 02:18:52,377
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called the Sega Genesis Ultimate Portable Game Player.

1718
02:18:52,878 --> 02:18:54,638
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's coming out November 13th.

1719
02:18:54,698 --> 02:18:55,779
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to cost $59.99.

1720
02:18:56,419 --> 02:19:01,201
[SPEAKER_06]: That's $60 for a Genesis, but it has 80 games built in.

1721
02:19:01,221 --> 02:19:02,541
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks vaguely like a Nomad.

1722
02:19:04,142 --> 02:19:05,662
[SPEAKER_06]: 37 of them are going to be from Sega.

1723
02:19:06,263 --> 02:19:06,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1724
02:19:07,203 --> 02:19:09,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this one that you plug into your TV?

1725
02:19:09,524 --> 02:19:11,065
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it looks like a portable system, doesn't it?

1726
02:19:11,085 --> 02:19:11,665
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be both.

1727
02:19:11,945 --> 02:19:12,745
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be both.

1728
02:19:12,765 --> 02:19:14,806
[SPEAKER_02]: You could do it with the Nomad.

1729
02:19:15,839 --> 02:19:18,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm trying to see real quick if that... I'm not sure.

1730
02:19:18,761 --> 02:19:26,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, there's 37 of these games from Sega, 3 from Capcom, and 40 from an assortment of other publishers.

1731
02:19:26,586 --> 02:19:27,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing.

1732
02:19:27,506 --> 02:19:32,669
[SPEAKER_06]: One of those Capcom games that's going to be on this player, Mega Man The Wily Wars.

1733
02:19:33,690 --> 02:19:44,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if you don't know what this game is, it's remakes of the first three Mega Mans on the NES along with a game called Wily Tower, like a little mini-game.

1734
02:19:45,057 --> 02:19:45,900
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1735
02:19:51,448 --> 02:19:53,770
[SPEAKER_06]: But how many people actually had the Sega Channel?

1736
02:19:54,170 --> 02:19:57,293
[SPEAKER_06]: So most people missed this when it was first out.

1737
02:19:57,333 --> 02:20:01,817
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's very interesting that all these years later, the Wily Wars is actually going to be out.

1738
02:20:01,897 --> 02:20:05,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I'm sure half you out there have already emulated this at this point.

1739
02:20:05,320 --> 02:20:09,103
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's still worth saying that this is on its way out.

1740
02:20:09,144 --> 02:20:11,426
[SPEAKER_06]: And who knows what other goodies could be in there.

1741
02:20:11,466 --> 02:20:13,527
[SPEAKER_06]: The only way we know about this one is it's on the box.

1742
02:20:14,128 --> 02:20:15,489
[SPEAKER_06]: So who knows what else is in there.

1743
02:20:15,529 --> 02:20:17,551
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty awesome.

1744
02:20:18,143 --> 02:20:19,665
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1745
02:20:37,083 --> 02:20:39,465
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a 2.8 inch LCD screen.

1746
02:20:39,506 --> 02:20:40,587
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a handheld player.

1747
02:20:41,027 --> 02:20:42,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Rechargeable battery built in.

1748
02:20:42,568 --> 02:20:45,151
[SPEAKER_06]: USB cable included for charging battery.

1749
02:20:45,171 --> 02:20:46,713
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't look like you can hook it up to the TV.

1750
02:20:46,733 --> 02:20:48,514
[SPEAKER_02]: I still recommend Power Battle.

1751
02:20:50,756 --> 02:20:51,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Never know.

1752
02:20:53,482 --> 02:20:54,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so there you go.

1753
02:20:55,884 --> 02:20:57,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Something new all these years later in the US.

1754
02:20:58,786 --> 02:20:59,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to the email bag.

1755
02:20:59,967 --> 02:21:04,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Every week we collect your emails at mailbag at orangelawnsradio.com All one of them?

1756
02:21:05,231 --> 02:21:05,791
[SPEAKER_06]: All one of them.

1757
02:21:05,811 --> 02:21:09,794
[SPEAKER_06]: So DarkSakura's going to dive into the email bag and say, hello, hello, hello.

1758
02:21:10,275 --> 02:21:11,295
[SPEAKER_06]: And then she'll look on the ground.

1759
02:21:11,455 --> 02:21:15,338
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, one lone little email in here.

1760
02:21:15,538 --> 02:21:17,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me just reach down here and pick it up.

1761
02:21:18,761 --> 02:21:21,623
[SPEAKER_06]: And she'll read that one email on the air here tonight.

1762
02:21:22,057 --> 02:21:22,738
[SPEAKER_02]: And here it is.

1763
02:21:23,899 --> 02:21:28,363
[SPEAKER_02]: I see that the stores have Wreck-It Ralph toys, but only three characters in the first wave.

1764
02:21:28,903 --> 02:21:31,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Ralph Fix-It Felix Jr.

1765
02:21:31,526 --> 02:21:33,407
[SPEAKER_02]: and Ralph in the Hero's Duty armor.

1766
02:21:34,248 --> 02:21:34,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Duty.

1767
02:21:35,489 --> 02:21:39,132
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand why they can't flood the shelves with Bowser's, Clyde's, and Q-Bert's.

1768
02:21:39,893 --> 02:21:41,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Who even holds that license now?

1769
02:21:41,713 --> 02:21:47,054
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a New York holding company licenses the Gotlight pinball tables, but what about the arcade cabinet games?

1770
02:21:47,555 --> 02:21:51,555
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now, more of the movie's original characters seem to be Disney Store only.

1771
02:21:52,336 --> 02:21:56,496
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to ask Loki, seriously this time, you mentioned suffering from weekend headaches.

1772
02:21:57,277 --> 02:22:00,937
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something affecting me as well, so what does your doctor think is causing it?

1773
02:22:01,057 --> 02:22:02,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Allergies or stress, maybe?

1774
02:22:02,118 --> 02:22:04,098
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, it'll go to my doctor.

1775
02:22:06,081 --> 02:22:08,183
[SPEAKER_07]: I should show you the pillow that I use that got rid of most of my headaches.

1776
02:22:22,910 --> 02:22:29,334
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki also gets a lot of stress caused by this show because he pops blood vessels every time a Nintendo story comes up.

1777
02:22:29,394 --> 02:22:30,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's be real.

1778
02:22:30,234 --> 02:22:31,315
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen that eye twitch.

1779
02:22:32,435 --> 02:22:40,920
[SPEAKER_06]: That comes from Robert M. The first part of the thing about the licensed toys, I think honestly that just would have cost Disney extra money.

1780
02:22:41,200 --> 02:22:42,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Disney doesn't want to push...

1781
02:22:44,162 --> 02:23:05,718
[SPEAKER_06]: other people's properties they want to push their own properties and remember and I don't know if you've actually seen the movie yet or what have you but remember the movie just uses all these licensed stuff to kind of get you into the plot that involves characters that are not based off of real games so of course Disney wants to build their own characters so you know

1782
02:23:06,638 --> 02:23:07,999
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's what it really boils down to.

1783
02:23:26,752 --> 02:23:40,440
[SPEAKER_06]: I think everybody recognizes Road Blasters, but did Road Blasters really have that same financial impact and did it make that same kind of money that maybe other comparable racing games did, like Pole Position, per se?

1784
02:23:41,040 --> 02:23:41,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably not.

1785
02:23:41,740 --> 02:23:44,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Iron Man, Off-Road, Stewart, that whole thing?

1786
02:23:44,362 --> 02:23:46,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably not, but everybody recognizes it.

1787
02:23:46,403 --> 02:23:47,064
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1788
02:24:12,282 --> 02:24:15,304
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there is an actual DDR machine in the movie.

1789
02:24:15,344 --> 02:24:15,645
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.

1790
02:24:15,805 --> 02:24:16,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there is.

1791
02:24:16,305 --> 02:24:17,986
[SPEAKER_07]: There's an X2 machine.

1792
02:24:18,126 --> 02:24:18,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Right at the start.

1793
02:24:18,947 --> 02:24:26,713
[SPEAKER_06]: They licensed the likeness from Konami, I'm sure, but that probably cost them a hell of a lot less than licensing Simon Belmont would have cost, you know?

1794
02:24:27,333 --> 02:24:29,795
[SPEAKER_06]: So, they're smart.

1795
02:24:32,758 --> 02:24:40,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Robert M in chat says, and technically yes, but what I was saying was hopefully Vanilla Girl and Sergeant Calhoun will be later characters.

1796
02:24:40,561 --> 02:24:41,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well, yes.

1797
02:24:41,602 --> 02:24:43,142
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope they are too.

1798
02:24:43,242 --> 02:24:45,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Vanilla P von Schweetz, is that what you're talking about?

1799
02:24:46,483 --> 02:24:50,885
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, she also made me think of Penelope Pitstop because the name was similar.

1800
02:24:51,872 --> 02:24:52,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1801
02:25:11,126 --> 02:25:12,728
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that was a really good pick.

1802
02:25:12,788 --> 02:25:15,750
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, all the voice actors were really good.

1803
02:25:16,270 --> 02:25:19,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Jane Lynch especially was a great choice for that character.

1804
02:25:20,453 --> 02:25:21,314
[SPEAKER_06]: She was perfect.

1805
02:25:22,034 --> 02:25:25,096
[SPEAKER_06]: And the 30 Rock guy as Fix-It Felix.

1806
02:25:25,517 --> 02:25:27,018
[SPEAKER_06]: They were all very great, great picks.

1807
02:25:28,291 --> 02:25:32,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, since that's it for the emails, shame, shame.

1808
02:25:32,072 --> 02:25:33,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1809
02:25:33,892 --> 02:25:35,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Send us more emails to read next week.

1810
02:25:36,033 --> 02:25:40,814
[SPEAKER_02]: In the meantime... And don't tell us about, you know, inheriting money from some guy in England.

1811
02:25:41,094 --> 02:25:45,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, or your, you know, pyramid scheme, or the French spam has to stop.

1812
02:25:47,135 --> 02:25:47,995
[SPEAKER_06]: End French spam.

1813
02:25:49,255 --> 02:25:49,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1814
02:25:50,216 --> 02:25:51,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Viva la French spam.

1815
02:25:53,196 --> 02:25:56,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, speaking of things that make us angsty like French spam...

1816
02:25:57,558 --> 02:25:58,492
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time for the FUs of the week.

1817
02:26:14,787 --> 02:26:27,757
[SPEAKER_02]: My FUs are, first of all, to the end of my sinus infection, to Origin, well, actually specifically, the patch for Mass Effect 3 and EA's customer service.

1818
02:26:28,517 --> 02:26:31,940
[SPEAKER_02]: It's keeping me from being able to play my game without restriction.

1819
02:26:33,001 --> 02:26:36,403
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of it's not cool, but really I can't play it at all.

1820
02:26:37,785 --> 02:26:39,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh...

1821
02:26:41,407 --> 02:26:44,610
[SPEAKER_02]: I had another one, but I'm distracted by Raccoon Penis.

1822
02:26:46,152 --> 02:26:46,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

1823
02:26:47,633 --> 02:27:01,846
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess just F you to... I'll F you to this whole week because we're in the whole crux of the fourth quarter stuff, and unfortunately in the position of...

1824
02:27:04,130 --> 02:27:05,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Distribution.

1825
02:27:06,272 --> 02:27:19,541
[SPEAKER_07]: See, Distribution right now, it seems like they don't get Call of Duty Black Ops 2 early enough so the independent stores get theirs before midnight launch, which pisses off everybody and keeps having those people ask,

1826
02:27:19,961 --> 02:27:23,062
[SPEAKER_07]: How am I supposed to stay in business and compete against games?

1827
02:27:23,522 --> 02:27:26,203
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, listen, I'm not your fucking person that's supposed to tell you that.

1828
02:27:26,223 --> 02:27:28,143
[SPEAKER_07]: If I told you that, I'd be running your store.

1829
02:27:28,943 --> 02:27:30,124
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not running your store.

1830
02:27:30,244 --> 02:27:31,984
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't get paid enough to run your store.

1831
02:27:32,364 --> 02:27:40,747
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't go up to, you know, you don't own a restaurant and go to your butcher or whatever and go, why can't I compete with these other restaurant chains?

1832
02:27:40,967 --> 02:27:41,727
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't make any sense.

1833
02:27:42,407 --> 02:27:43,107
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's annoying.

1834
02:27:43,328 --> 02:27:49,251
[SPEAKER_07]: And on top of all that, the rest of my co-workers, sales staff, get to go to Napa for a fun three-day weekend.

1835
02:27:50,352 --> 02:27:58,116
[SPEAKER_07]: But because I landlocked the wife, I do not get to go to Napa.

1836
02:27:58,636 --> 02:28:00,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that I was enjoying that because it's all wine tasting.

1837
02:28:00,877 --> 02:28:02,257
[SPEAKER_07]: I fucking hate wine.

1838
02:28:02,717 --> 02:28:03,337
[SPEAKER_07]: I like wine.

1839
02:28:03,437 --> 02:28:04,337
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't like wine.

1840
02:28:04,497 --> 02:28:06,138
[SPEAKER_07]: See, I was excited about it because I was like, sweet.

1841
02:28:06,358 --> 02:28:08,598
[SPEAKER_07]: Second day is usually kind of that whole fun.

1842
02:28:08,658 --> 02:28:10,399
[SPEAKER_07]: You get to go do whatever you want.

1843
02:28:10,519 --> 02:28:11,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they have like activities planned out.

1844
02:28:12,459 --> 02:28:15,000
[SPEAKER_07]: But now they only have one activity and that's wine tasting.

1845
02:28:15,020 --> 02:28:16,940
[SPEAKER_07]: See, my activity would be fuck all the activities.

1846
02:28:17,060 --> 02:28:20,981
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm driving to Menlo Park and I'm going to go to fucking Cusar.

1847
02:28:22,261 --> 02:28:24,502
[SPEAKER_07]: But no, that's not going to happen.

1848
02:28:24,562 --> 02:28:25,122
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's fine.

1849
02:28:27,396 --> 02:28:28,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I don't know.

1850
02:28:28,977 --> 02:28:32,498
[SPEAKER_06]: I have general angst this week, but not things I can really put into words.

1851
02:28:32,578 --> 02:28:33,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Just stuff and things.

1852
02:28:33,799 --> 02:28:37,320
[SPEAKER_06]: So, F you to stuff and things.

1853
02:28:38,381 --> 02:28:39,141
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all you get.

1854
02:28:40,642 --> 02:28:50,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, uh, let's move on to a few more quick news stories, and then we're gonna get to your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR and Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, on Skype.

1855
02:28:50,966 --> 02:28:52,467
[SPEAKER_06]: But first, two more stories for you.

1856
02:28:52,527 --> 02:28:52,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

1857
02:28:52,967 --> 02:28:53,207
[SPEAKER_07]: FISHVILLE

1858
02:29:13,513 --> 02:29:15,834
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, seriously, this whole Ville thing has got to stop.

1859
02:29:15,874 --> 02:29:17,855
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it just sounds stupid.

1860
02:29:18,416 --> 02:29:24,939
[SPEAKER_07]: But FishVille and Treasure Isle are the first two games that will be kind of going by.

1861
02:29:25,580 --> 02:29:30,403
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're going to stop running on December 5th.

1862
02:29:31,143 --> 02:29:36,986
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess FishVille is a game where people fish?

1863
02:29:38,387 --> 02:29:39,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Or are fish?

1864
02:29:39,127 --> 02:29:40,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Imagine that!

1865
02:29:40,168 --> 02:29:40,748
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, it's...

1866
02:29:42,209 --> 02:29:43,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Who gives a fuck?

1867
02:29:43,550 --> 02:29:44,191
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

1868
02:29:44,251 --> 02:29:45,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I really don't.

1869
02:29:48,554 --> 02:29:54,879
[SPEAKER_07]: But they do refer to their players as Fishvillers as this email from the Fishville team.

1870
02:29:56,861 --> 02:29:57,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

1871
02:29:58,894 --> 02:30:00,475
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, one more story for you guys.

1872
02:30:00,655 --> 02:30:03,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's one for the classic OLR fans.

1873
02:30:04,577 --> 02:30:06,839
[SPEAKER_06]: DDR Classroom Edition.

1874
02:30:06,999 --> 02:30:09,820
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some extra information coming out about DDR Classroom Edition.

1875
02:30:09,860 --> 02:30:15,043
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, that's kind of where DDR lives on now, is in PE programs in schools, which I think is great.

1876
02:30:16,024 --> 02:30:18,645
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great way to get kids involved in Dance Dance Revolution.

1877
02:30:19,006 --> 02:30:21,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the interesting thing about DDR Classroom Edition.

1878
02:30:21,167 --> 02:30:23,768
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably better than any other version of the game.

1879
02:30:25,049 --> 02:30:25,429
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1880
02:30:25,449 --> 02:30:25,669
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1881
02:30:48,877 --> 02:30:52,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently going to get new music updates every three to six months.

1882
02:30:52,622 --> 02:30:59,772
[SPEAKER_06]: After some successful location tests in Southern California at some schools there, they're being very aggressive about the title.

1883
02:30:59,852 --> 02:31:04,118
[SPEAKER_06]: Too bad it's something for schools and not for...

1884
02:31:06,656 --> 02:31:08,057
[SPEAKER_06]: People to, like, actually get.

1885
02:31:08,137 --> 02:31:19,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's the thing, though, is I think a lot of this stuff that they're probably licensing for the classroom edition is probably going to end up in Dance Dance Revolution, the fourth or fifth reboot of the franchise.

1886
02:31:19,964 --> 02:31:20,805
[SPEAKER_06]: The new one coming out?

1887
02:31:20,885 --> 02:31:23,426
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that'd be my guess, because they're doing too many licenses.

1888
02:31:23,466 --> 02:31:29,050
[SPEAKER_07]: I doubt they would dump that much money into a classroom edition, which really doesn't need a diverse...

1889
02:31:29,990 --> 02:31:35,974
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you think about it, do you really need a diverse soundtrack for the classroom edition?

1890
02:31:36,974 --> 02:31:49,282
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'm assuming most of this stuff is going to be picked by the teacher in the class and no one's going to go, oh my goodness, I really want to hear that song by the Screaming Masks or...

1891
02:31:51,922 --> 02:31:54,364
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a pink song, So What?

1892
02:31:54,524 --> 02:31:55,785
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard that song on the radio.

1893
02:31:56,686 --> 02:32:03,032
[SPEAKER_06]: Natasha Bedingfield, Pocket Full of Sunshine, although I think, wasn't that in the DDR release on the most recent PlayStation?

1894
02:32:03,192 --> 02:32:03,573
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1895
02:32:05,975 --> 02:32:10,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Chris Brown's song, you know, because they really should encourage his stuff in schools.

1896
02:32:10,840 --> 02:32:11,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1897
02:32:13,243 --> 02:32:14,764
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a huge song list, though.

1898
02:32:15,265 --> 02:32:17,427
[SPEAKER_06]: 397 songs looking at the PDF.

1899
02:32:17,667 --> 02:32:18,968
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure it ain't cheap.

1900
02:32:19,568 --> 02:32:26,854
[SPEAKER_07]: The question is, and thankfully they have this totally not sorted by artist, is Holic in the game?

1901
02:32:28,876 --> 02:32:29,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Holic in there?

1902
02:32:30,177 --> 02:32:31,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Holic is not in there.

1903
02:32:31,118 --> 02:32:32,039
[SPEAKER_07]: At least I don't see it.

1904
02:32:32,139 --> 02:32:33,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe future DLC.

1905
02:32:34,140 --> 02:32:35,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Hot Limit, though, is.

1906
02:32:36,722 --> 02:32:37,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

1907
02:32:38,140 --> 02:32:39,421
[SPEAKER_06]: You say Dramamine.

1908
02:32:40,081 --> 02:32:40,401
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1909
02:32:41,142 --> 02:32:41,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to the phones.

1910
02:32:42,002 --> 02:32:45,644
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or I use your name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio.

1911
02:32:46,124 --> 02:32:48,566
[SPEAKER_06]: The phones are now open.

1912
02:32:48,946 --> 02:32:49,686
[SPEAKER_06]: You can give us a call.

1913
02:32:50,227 --> 02:32:54,409
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go to the Twitter topics, but I got to grab my iPad.

1914
02:32:54,809 --> 02:32:57,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, do you have any last minute stories?

1915
02:32:58,071 --> 02:33:02,173
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I was just checking out some of the... Stop it.

1916
02:33:02,714 --> 02:33:04,715
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just checking out some of the songs that are in here.

1917
02:33:04,775 --> 02:33:06,816
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just seeing what they've got here and...

1918
02:33:08,294 --> 02:33:09,295
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I was asleep.

1919
02:33:10,277 --> 02:33:14,622
[SPEAKER_07]: They really don't have this in any sort of order.

1920
02:33:15,323 --> 02:33:17,947
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to see if Holic is in here.

1921
02:33:18,487 --> 02:33:19,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Holic is the best song ever.

1922
02:33:20,169 --> 02:33:23,313
[SPEAKER_07]: They have Silent Hill, Thomas Howard for Christmas.

1923
02:33:23,474 --> 02:33:23,954
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of cool.

1924
02:33:26,590 --> 02:33:31,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what happens in school now during the winter is like DDR time in PE?

1925
02:33:31,394 --> 02:33:33,295
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I think that would be fucking awesome.

1926
02:33:34,016 --> 02:33:39,640
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be really awesome to have that because it was what ultimate, it was like dodgeball or something like that.

1927
02:33:40,441 --> 02:33:41,502
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell did we used to do?

1928
02:33:41,562 --> 02:33:42,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Play basketball maybe?

1929
02:33:42,903 --> 02:33:43,823
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to do square dancing.

1930
02:33:43,843 --> 02:33:44,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we used to do square dancing.

1931
02:33:44,784 --> 02:33:45,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Square dancing was the best.

1932
02:33:47,546 --> 02:33:47,987
[SPEAKER_06]: You're weird.

1933
02:33:49,808 --> 02:33:51,630
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the one thing I was good at.

1934
02:33:53,248 --> 02:33:54,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Grab your partner.

1935
02:33:54,188 --> 02:33:55,349
[SPEAKER_06]: That and Pickleball.

1936
02:33:55,509 --> 02:33:56,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you guys ever play Pickleball?

1937
02:33:56,670 --> 02:33:56,910
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1938
02:33:57,350 --> 02:33:58,230
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the other thing.

1939
02:33:58,250 --> 02:34:02,132
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like tennis, but kind of like dumbed down a little bit.

1940
02:34:02,312 --> 02:34:05,274
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a game that we would play that was called Sink the Bismarck.

1941
02:34:05,994 --> 02:34:06,254
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1942
02:34:07,152 --> 02:34:09,133
[SPEAKER_02]: After the ship from the World War.

1943
02:34:10,814 --> 02:34:19,619
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, you had two sides, and you had a few students in the middle, and they were the water mines.

1944
02:34:20,399 --> 02:34:23,320
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the students were all the ships crossing the ocean.

1945
02:34:24,201 --> 02:34:32,185
[SPEAKER_02]: And if one of the land mines managed to touch, or not land mines, but the water mines managed to touch one of the other students, then they became a mine, and they had to stop where they were.

1946
02:34:32,725 --> 02:34:34,906
[SPEAKER_02]: And until the last one left was the winner.

1947
02:34:35,787 --> 02:34:35,927
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1948
02:34:40,110 --> 02:34:42,092
[SPEAKER_06]: I just remember every Friday we had to run the mile.

1949
02:34:43,733 --> 02:34:44,374
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

1950
02:34:44,614 --> 02:34:49,098
[SPEAKER_06]: Going to Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR.

1951
02:34:50,860 --> 02:34:52,381
[SPEAKER_06]: Thankfully, there's no let them move.

1952
02:34:53,823 --> 02:34:55,384
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100 Matt linked us this story.

1953
02:34:55,544 --> 02:35:00,969
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought this was in our show role, but I think it just might have not made this week.

1954
02:35:01,030 --> 02:35:01,350
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1955
02:35:01,630 --> 02:35:04,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Take two is going to be opening a new Las Vegas office.

1956
02:35:04,413 --> 02:35:04,574
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1957
02:35:04,594 --> 02:35:09,039
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was one of the stories you posted that we just didn't get to tonight because you talked to Grand Theft Auto somewhere else.

1958
02:35:09,459 --> 02:35:13,984
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, 150 jobs in Las Vegas, a brand new downtown office.

1959
02:35:14,405 --> 02:35:19,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Las Vegas Redevelopment Agency is offering up $600,000 in incentives to take two if they open the branch.

1960
02:35:20,912 --> 02:35:43,966
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm telling you man Vegas is a pretty awesome you mean because everyone really thinks that Vegas is kind of like ooh casinos and stuff like that but it's actually a pretty cool suburb with like really cheap housing and it's not bad if like you're not into the whole casino thing it's still like a nice suburb I'm not sure if everybody who lives there would agree with you but let's go to the it seemed like a nice suburb I don't know hi you're on orange launch radio who's this

1961
02:35:45,061 --> 02:35:46,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, a survivor of the hurricane, Ranma.

1962
02:35:47,144 --> 02:35:49,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, so you came out okay, huh?

1963
02:35:49,607 --> 02:35:50,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, pretty much.

1964
02:35:50,928 --> 02:35:56,275
[SPEAKER_05]: One of our studios, aka Joe Vigdea, she lost power for a few days, but other than that, came out pretty good.

1965
02:35:56,495 --> 02:36:00,080
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, a lot worse things could happen than losing power for a few days.

1966
02:36:00,460 --> 02:36:01,241
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad to hear...

1967
02:36:02,262 --> 02:36:09,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Places are recovering, you know, it's really tragic seeing a lot of the stuff that's happening along the New Jersey shore and all of that.

1968
02:36:09,649 --> 02:36:20,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, all the jokes about reality TV aside, like, seeing that roller coaster just submerged in water is just, like, jaw on floor type of thing.

1969
02:36:20,958 --> 02:36:24,581
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, it's upsetting, but, you know...

1970
02:36:25,442 --> 02:36:43,390
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I'm seeing the photos of the train station that's right by my house and the one view a little bit down the way, seeing all that water had me spazzing and then like on Wednesday when they started saying you can take the train, you can take some of the buses, me and a couple of friends went down to Coney Island to survey some of the damage.

1971
02:36:43,730 --> 02:36:47,492
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the pictures, it didn't seem like it was that bad.

1972
02:36:48,137 --> 02:36:48,897
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1973
02:37:05,523 --> 02:37:06,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

1974
02:37:27,967 --> 02:37:32,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, pretty much, and now they're talking about another storm coming our way in about two days.

1975
02:37:32,731 --> 02:37:33,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, goody.

1976
02:37:33,872 --> 02:37:38,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's why you're supposed to fill your bathtub with water, have bleach, get canned food, buy all the bread.

1977
02:37:39,016 --> 02:37:39,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Tape your windows.

1978
02:37:41,378 --> 02:37:45,461
[SPEAKER_05]: I did all of that, and we had a big ol' bucket of hurricane to drink.

1979
02:37:48,124 --> 02:37:50,666
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will tell you, welcome to my childhood.

1980
02:37:51,226 --> 02:37:54,529
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma, I'm sure you didn't just call in to talk about the storm, but thank you for the update.

1981
02:37:55,089 --> 02:37:55,830
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind tonight?

1982
02:37:57,343 --> 02:38:03,669
[SPEAKER_05]: My issues with Xbox and banning people for names and insults and stuff.

1983
02:38:03,969 --> 02:38:06,832
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I kind of see both points on this.

1984
02:38:07,172 --> 02:38:17,001
[SPEAKER_05]: It just feels like this is no different from being in high school and you're being bullied and you're hearing N-word, F-word, K-word, all this stuff.

1985
02:38:17,262 --> 02:38:20,064
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, if you run your mouth, if you go...

1986
02:38:22,725 --> 02:38:23,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Go report it.

1987
02:38:23,565 --> 02:38:24,126
[SPEAKER_05]: This happens.

1988
02:38:24,166 --> 02:38:24,706
[SPEAKER_05]: That happens.

1989
02:38:25,226 --> 02:38:31,929
[SPEAKER_05]: In a way, I kind of feel like just let them handle their own business.

1990
02:38:32,589 --> 02:38:41,132
[SPEAKER_05]: But on the same token, if it's just a bunch of friends running their mouth having a good time, you have that one person coming in, starting to freak out, and then all hell breaks loose.

1991
02:38:41,353 --> 02:38:44,414
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but if you're going to play with your friends, why would you let that one person in anyway?

1992
02:38:45,254 --> 02:39:06,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, it's always in that, in the group, it's like, you always bring that one person, like, oh, don't worry, he's cool, he's understandable, she's cool, she's understandable, and then you're like, and you find out later, oh, shit Or, back in the day when we'd do PSO and only three of us were online and we wanted a fourth to do the full challenge, we would just go to Open Lobby, the three of us, and pull another person

1993
02:39:06,974 --> 02:39:07,334
[SPEAKER_06]: XBOX 360 XBOX 360

1994
02:39:24,802 --> 02:39:30,425
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, you know, like Shane and I might be playing Mass Effect and maybe we have, you know, Acidic Vampire, Osfer, somebody with us.

1995
02:39:30,745 --> 02:39:37,048
[SPEAKER_06]: So like the three of us will be in the party chat and then we'll bring in a random fourth, but they can't hear us because we're in the party chat.

1996
02:39:37,509 --> 02:39:37,989
[SPEAKER_06]: That's good.

1997
02:39:38,109 --> 02:39:39,750
[SPEAKER_06]: And that dialogue doesn't go out in game.

1998
02:39:39,810 --> 02:39:42,691
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, we have to remember the Xbox does have that infrastructure set up.

1999
02:39:43,011 --> 02:39:49,715
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you do want to bring in randoms to fill out your party, you know, you can still have your closed conversation without worrying about offending some stranger.

2000
02:39:49,735 --> 02:39:49,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2001
02:39:51,687 --> 02:39:52,127
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.

2002
02:39:52,588 --> 02:39:54,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so that's a solution.

2003
02:39:54,149 --> 02:39:58,493
[SPEAKER_06]: But I still get what you're saying, you know, where you don't want that one person.

2004
02:39:58,513 --> 02:40:08,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Because still, you could be bringing somebody into your little party chat that maybe you kind of didn't estimate correctly and maybe will take offense.

2005
02:40:09,142 --> 02:40:19,891
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think, I don't know, I guess Microsoft to some extent maybe has a responsibility to not regulate private games the same way they would regulate a public game.

2006
02:40:21,332 --> 02:40:22,273
[SPEAKER_06]: That works for me Yep

2007
02:40:36,275 --> 02:40:43,001
[SPEAKER_06]: although some would argue it's toxic to use those words in any circumstance, but that's a debate for another time, I suppose.

2008
02:40:43,101 --> 02:40:45,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, definitely.

2009
02:40:46,043 --> 02:40:48,185
[SPEAKER_06]: So, gosh, anything else on your mind tonight, buddy?

2010
02:40:49,086 --> 02:40:51,407
[SPEAKER_06]: A friend of mine did a voice in Wreck-It Ralph.

2011
02:40:52,068 --> 02:40:52,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, really?

2012
02:40:52,729 --> 02:40:53,229
[SPEAKER_06]: What voice?

2013
02:40:53,269 --> 02:40:53,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know?

2014
02:40:54,410 --> 02:40:55,111
[SPEAKER_06]: He was Ryu.

2015
02:40:56,271 --> 02:40:57,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Get out!

2016
02:40:57,833 --> 02:40:58,814
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.

2017
02:41:00,915 --> 02:41:03,117
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a quick scene, but it was funny.

2018
02:41:03,457 --> 02:41:04,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody laughed.

2019
02:41:05,558 --> 02:41:06,258
[SPEAKER_05]: So will the Wii U launch?

2020
02:41:31,434 --> 02:41:42,283
[SPEAKER_06]: We need stories from the Wii U launch I don't know what's going on here Everything about this launch is very mysterious to me It seems like it's all done in pre-orders Are people even camping out?

2021
02:41:42,343 --> 02:41:43,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that a thing anymore?

2022
02:41:44,125 --> 02:41:45,406
[SPEAKER_06]: People are camping

2023
02:41:46,755 --> 02:41:52,099
[SPEAKER_05]: My younger brother, Greg, upon hearing about the preords and all of this, he sends me a message.

2024
02:41:52,860 --> 02:41:56,002
[SPEAKER_05]: You are coming with me to camp out for the Wii U, right?

2025
02:41:56,703 --> 02:41:57,424
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess.

2026
02:41:57,764 --> 02:41:59,165
[SPEAKER_05]: You are coming, right?

2027
02:41:59,345 --> 02:42:00,906
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I will be there.

2028
02:42:01,147 --> 02:42:02,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Just save me some soup.

2029
02:42:03,068 --> 02:42:04,089
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to camp out.

2030
02:42:04,129 --> 02:42:06,491
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to go on Amazon and have them ship it.

2031
02:42:06,511 --> 02:42:07,672
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just lazy.

2032
02:42:08,610 --> 02:42:10,052
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm too old to camp out.

2033
02:42:10,813 --> 02:42:11,715
[SPEAKER_06]: You haven't ordered it yet?

2034
02:42:12,937 --> 02:42:14,519
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care and I don't want one.

2035
02:42:15,641 --> 02:42:17,964
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hoping I have connections that can help me get one.

2036
02:42:18,525 --> 02:42:19,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I plan on getting one.

2037
02:42:20,007 --> 02:42:21,209
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

2038
02:42:21,229 --> 02:42:22,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you have to let us know how it is.

2039
02:42:22,910 --> 02:42:23,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, by the way.

2040
02:42:23,670 --> 02:42:25,591
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just buying this.

2041
02:42:25,631 --> 02:42:28,611
[SPEAKER_05]: I can just put it on eBay.

2042
02:42:28,731 --> 02:42:30,152
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing real quick about Wreck-It Ralph.

2043
02:42:31,172 --> 02:42:35,153
[SPEAKER_02]: The little film at the very beginning of it will give you sniffles.

2044
02:42:35,773 --> 02:42:35,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

2045
02:42:35,973 --> 02:42:37,573
[SPEAKER_06]: It was so Paper Man.

2046
02:42:37,893 --> 02:42:39,934
[SPEAKER_06]: The little short, because that's like a thing now.

2047
02:42:39,974 --> 02:42:43,514
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of Pixar movies and Disney, even Disney classics, have these shorts in front of them.

2048
02:42:43,534 --> 02:42:44,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was really good.

2049
02:42:44,094 --> 02:42:46,355
[SPEAKER_02]: It was called Paper Man, and it was really sweet.

2050
02:42:46,575 --> 02:42:46,955
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cute.

2051
02:42:46,975 --> 02:42:47,815
[SPEAKER_06]: It was cute.

2052
02:42:48,355 --> 02:42:48,575
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

2053
02:42:48,595 --> 02:42:51,916
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm referring Paper Man to Slender Man, albeit from me.

2054
02:42:52,580 --> 02:42:54,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well Ranma, we're gonna let you go so we can get some more calls, okay?

2055
02:42:55,344 --> 02:42:55,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, cool.

2056
02:42:55,964 --> 02:42:56,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, bye!

2057
02:42:59,266 --> 02:43:04,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Always nice to hear from Ranma, one of the hosts of Anime Jam Session, Tuesdays on the Voice of Geeks Network.

2058
02:43:04,990 --> 02:43:09,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I didn't mention this during the show, but some of you probably picked up on this.

2059
02:43:09,933 --> 02:43:13,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Our feed was down for like four days this week.

2060
02:43:13,776 --> 02:43:14,776
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty crazy.

2061
02:43:15,477 --> 02:43:18,159
[SPEAKER_06]: So some of our programming got rolled over to next week.

2062
02:43:18,559 --> 02:43:24,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Critical Myth will be back next week with some of the episodes that got missed due to the outage.

2063
02:43:25,123 --> 02:43:29,026
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the Warcraft shows, unfortunately, they're just going to have to be missed.

2064
02:43:29,963 --> 02:43:32,305
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, we got another call coming in, so let's go to the phones.

2065
02:43:32,365 --> 02:43:33,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2066
02:43:33,326 --> 02:43:33,666
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

2067
02:43:34,807 --> 02:43:35,227
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, guys.

2068
02:43:35,268 --> 02:43:36,889
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the one and only Degenerate Johnny.

2069
02:43:37,029 --> 02:43:37,569
[SPEAKER_00]: How you guys doing?

2070
02:43:37,870 --> 02:43:39,111
[SPEAKER_06]: What is up, Degenerate Johnny?

2071
02:43:39,151 --> 02:43:41,213
[SPEAKER_06]: You wrote that comment on Facebook earlier, right?

2072
02:43:41,773 --> 02:43:42,233
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I did.

2073
02:43:42,353 --> 02:43:44,475
[SPEAKER_00]: I called in to follow up on that.

2074
02:43:44,615 --> 02:43:45,076
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do.

2075
02:43:46,667 --> 02:43:59,980
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so basically, it seems to me that gaming in the culture that we live today, it still hasn't really gotten it through these people's heads.

2076
02:44:00,020 --> 02:44:01,942
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, look back a few years back.

2077
02:44:03,563 --> 02:44:04,324
[SPEAKER_00]: Fox News.

2078
02:44:05,004 --> 02:44:10,126
[SPEAKER_00]: I geeked out when Fox News was saying, oh yeah, we're going to talk about Mass Effect.

2079
02:44:10,146 --> 02:44:11,627
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh my goodness!

2080
02:44:12,167 --> 02:44:16,509
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was nothing but a bash fest over that 30 second love scene.

2081
02:44:16,549 --> 02:44:19,830
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, what the hell is this crap?

2082
02:44:20,110 --> 02:44:24,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Of which there is much worse stuff shown on Fox Television.

2083
02:44:25,013 --> 02:44:25,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

2084
02:44:25,533 --> 02:44:25,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Glee and shit.

2085
02:44:29,841 --> 02:44:30,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's it.

2086
02:44:31,282 --> 02:44:35,445
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just saying Glee and House and all those shows have far worse content.

2087
02:44:36,245 --> 02:44:36,946
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, exactly.

2088
02:44:36,986 --> 02:44:48,113
[SPEAKER_00]: And even their quote-unquote expert, Cooper Lawrence, said herself that she saw sayings in Lost that were actually more explicit than that love scene.

2089
02:44:50,154 --> 02:44:55,778
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it seems amazing to me that, you know,

2090
02:44:56,750 --> 02:44:59,032
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing has evolved ever since, you know, 1993.

2091
02:45:00,013 --> 02:45:04,736
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where I think the gaming industry has evolved.

2092
02:45:06,057 --> 02:45:16,265
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the moment that Congress approached the Electronic Software Association after Mortal Kombat and Doom and saying, hey, you know what, we appreciate, you know,

2093
02:45:16,912 --> 02:45:17,372
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura.com

2094
02:45:38,924 --> 02:45:41,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let me throw this out there, just to be devil's advocate.

2095
02:45:41,826 --> 02:45:45,428
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that I disagree with you, but I want to throw this thought out here and see what you think about this.

2096
02:45:45,789 --> 02:45:54,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Because 20 years ago, which, you know, 93 was almost 20 years ago at this point, another industry that faced a lot of battles in Congress was the music industry.

2097
02:45:55,495 --> 02:45:59,337
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is because gangster rap started to take a storm a little bit.

2098
02:45:59,678 --> 02:46:05,361
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is where that whole little black and white sticker that says parental advisory, caution, explicit lyrics came from.

2099
02:46:05,541 --> 02:46:08,023
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of this is perpetuated by the same person between the two.

2100
02:46:08,483 --> 02:46:09,384
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, hilarious, right?

2101
02:46:09,744 --> 02:46:23,374
[SPEAKER_06]: But where it came from regardless, music doesn't get that same, pardon the pun, rap that video games does in being accepted in mainstream culture.

2102
02:46:23,454 --> 02:46:28,798
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I guess one could argue there's still a lot of people that say gangster rap's not music.

2103
02:46:29,158 --> 02:46:29,819
[SPEAKER_06]: It's garbage.

2104
02:46:31,039 --> 02:46:34,122
[SPEAKER_06]: There's people out there that feel that way, whether they're right or wrong.

2105
02:46:34,742 --> 02:47:00,617
[SPEAKER_00]: so I you know it's it's just interesting to me that you know music fought a lot of that stuff in the 90s too yet music I mean it fought it fought against that bell you know way before then I mean hell the Beatles were considered the devil's music that's right play the records backwards remember yeah I was like how am I working with the devil when I'm hearing I want to hold your hand what the hell

2106
02:47:01,878 --> 02:47:08,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's you wanting to hold the devil's hand as you walk through the lakes of fire and fiery hell.

2107
02:47:09,321 --> 02:47:11,682
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, dear lord, lordy, oh my goodness.

2108
02:47:12,343 --> 02:47:16,705
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, it just astounds me.

2109
02:47:16,885 --> 02:47:28,930
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, to follow up on what I also said is that, you know, I do agree with you that entertainment today actually requires, you know, you know,

2110
02:47:29,318 --> 02:47:31,239
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching!

2111
02:47:53,144 --> 02:48:03,940
[SPEAKER_00]: and so I've been actually studying up on this and seeing how all these forms of entertainment obviously still some entertainments you know

2112
02:48:04,972 --> 02:48:11,894
[SPEAKER_00]: are a little, you know, they cling to their old ways, you know, tradition, which I do respect.

2113
02:48:11,934 --> 02:48:31,039
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there are obviously plays and playwrights and it, you know, as a matter of fact, you know, what you and Jessica Harper recently did with the Rocky Horror, you know, I mean, that is a, you know, a form of evolution from, you know, the plays and playwrights and, you know, it's becoming, you know,

2114
02:48:33,047 --> 02:48:38,889
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny you bring that up because that in particular is something... I actually was at Rocky Horror last night.

2115
02:48:38,909 --> 02:48:40,530
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I got home at 5 in the morning.

2116
02:48:40,710 --> 02:48:45,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I was with one of the Bay Area cast who was celebrating their 17th birthday as a cast.

2117
02:48:45,532 --> 02:48:50,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Rocky Horror is something that's been around for 35 years.

2118
02:48:51,094 --> 02:48:54,676
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is interesting you talk about it... God, I could fill another show with this.

2119
02:48:55,076 --> 02:48:56,477
[SPEAKER_06]: You just set me on a tangent.

2120
02:48:57,017 --> 02:49:05,861
[SPEAKER_06]: It is interesting that that whole stuff could be considered another art form because there's other movies now that, you know, people want to kind of shadow cast and bring to that.

2121
02:49:06,262 --> 02:49:10,924
[SPEAKER_06]: And especially with the group I've been working with here in Sacramento, they really have made an art out of it.

2122
02:49:10,964 --> 02:49:15,486
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I know I'm talking up, but you've got to see the way they do Repo the Genetic Opera.

2123
02:49:15,966 --> 02:49:19,568
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, like, that movie, for all practical purposes, is kind of stupid.

2124
02:49:20,168 --> 02:49:22,710
[SPEAKER_06]: But when you see the stage show of it, you're like...

2125
02:49:23,658 --> 02:49:25,540
[SPEAKER_06]: is this shit for real?

2126
02:49:25,640 --> 02:49:48,497
[SPEAKER_06]: this is crazy I mean words can only can't even describe it it's the atmosphere and now they're talking about doing it for and I don't know how much I'm supposed to say on my little radio show or not but now they're talking about doing it for The Room and there was talk about doing Scott Pilgrim vs. The World at one point they've had to put that on hold I think it's a rights thing but that was like gonna be a thing so

2127
02:49:49,346 --> 02:49:55,513
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Jessica said something last night on Under Sedation Live that she was actually going to be doing something that involves a room.

2128
02:49:55,673 --> 02:50:01,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I have mixed feelings about the room, but anyway, we'll leave that to another show.

2129
02:50:02,461 --> 02:50:04,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, but let me go back to video games with this.

2130
02:50:04,922 --> 02:50:07,663
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to ask you about this so we can wrap up.

2131
02:50:08,703 --> 02:50:21,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you did kind of make the comment on Facebook, let me ask you, what would you like to see happen next with the video game movie working hand in hand together in this fusion?

2132
02:50:21,327 --> 02:50:23,287
[SPEAKER_06]: What would you like to see happen next with that?

2133
02:50:23,627 --> 02:50:26,148
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, do you think we need to stop obsessing about it?

2134
02:50:27,583 --> 02:50:38,640
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I think we need to stop obsessing on it because, you know, you look at the past, the two industries never really, you know, you know,

2135
02:50:39,209 --> 02:50:45,813
[SPEAKER_00]: They never really generate a form of something that's really successful.

2136
02:50:58,321 --> 02:50:59,562
[SPEAKER_00]: being based off of a game.

2137
02:50:59,742 --> 02:51:01,782
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see Oscar winning award games.

2138
02:51:01,842 --> 02:51:08,245
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know we all want to see Mass Effect on the big screen and we want to see Warcraft on the big screen.

2139
02:51:08,605 --> 02:51:11,786
[SPEAKER_06]: But in reality, I think we just... Those movies are going to suck.

2140
02:51:12,607 --> 02:51:17,328
[SPEAKER_06]: If you are a fan of those games, there is no possible way those movies are going to satisfy you.

2141
02:51:17,729 --> 02:51:21,010
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think I really do see your point here because there is no...

2142
02:51:21,630 --> 02:51:29,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Possible way, no possible way you can adapt the Mass Effect games into a movie and leave people satisfied.

2143
02:51:29,953 --> 02:51:31,854
[SPEAKER_06]: They will be pissed.

2144
02:51:32,094 --> 02:51:36,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like Harry Potter fans always are mad that the books aren't adapted correctly.

2145
02:51:36,956 --> 02:51:41,821
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure somebody's got a problem with Lord of the Rings, although to be fair, they do it okay.

2146
02:51:42,822 --> 02:51:44,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Mass Effect is a video game.

2147
02:51:45,045 --> 02:51:46,406
[SPEAKER_06]: It is not going to work as a movie.

2148
02:51:46,646 --> 02:51:48,288
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's why Wreck-It Ralph worked.

2149
02:51:48,668 --> 02:51:50,350
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Wreck-It Ralph wasn't a game.

2150
02:51:50,730 --> 02:51:53,293
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a movie about gaming culture.

2151
02:51:54,175 --> 02:51:54,735
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

2152
02:51:55,895 --> 02:52:21,162
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why Hope is viewed as a story that involves the characters that we all love to play with, but I just hope it doesn't go past that and still is conceived as what video games are today, as a child's toy, because we have progressed so much beyond that point.

2153
02:52:22,461 --> 02:52:27,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well Degenerate Johnny, I gotta let you go so we can see if we can get another call and wrap up the show, but great phone call.

2154
02:52:27,814 --> 02:52:28,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't be a stranger.

2155
02:52:29,618 --> 02:52:30,199
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, take care.

2156
02:52:30,760 --> 02:52:30,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

2157
02:52:32,611 --> 02:52:33,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Really good points.

2158
02:52:34,212 --> 02:52:38,393
[SPEAKER_06]: He hasn't called into the show an awful lot, but I like some of the points he was raising there.

2159
02:52:38,453 --> 02:52:40,093
[SPEAKER_06]: So definitely worth talking to.

2160
02:52:40,113 --> 02:52:40,734
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.

2161
02:52:41,654 --> 02:52:44,135
[SPEAKER_06]: We are the show where every gamer has a voice.

2162
02:52:44,155 --> 02:52:45,015
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2163
02:52:45,135 --> 02:52:47,076
[SPEAKER_06]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2164
02:52:47,396 --> 02:52:49,977
[SPEAKER_06]: If we can get another call in here real quick, we'll take it.

2165
02:52:50,377 --> 02:52:52,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, we might just wrap up for the night.

2166
02:52:52,938 --> 02:52:57,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me go to Twitter, though, because I still had some more of these tweets I wanted to get to.

2167
02:52:57,779 --> 02:53:02,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Including one from Tiger Claw that talks about the Halo 4 Amex card thing.

2168
02:53:03,201 --> 02:53:10,164
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember reading a little bit about this, but, you know, I don't have an American Express myself, so I just kind of scrolled on by.

2169
02:53:10,684 --> 02:53:22,008
[SPEAKER_06]: But apparently there is a partnership between Microsoft and American Express so that if you are a cardholder, you get coupons and credits for tying your account to Xbox Live and playing Halo 4.

2170
02:53:24,025 --> 02:53:25,206
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2171
02:53:42,856 --> 02:53:48,740
[SPEAKER_06]: If you complete the single player campaign on normal or harder difficulty, you get a $25 statement credit.

2172
02:53:49,280 --> 02:53:52,522
[SPEAKER_06]: If you are one of the first 25 people in the U.S.

2173
02:53:53,383 --> 02:54:03,329
[SPEAKER_06]: to complete the campaign alone on legendary difficulty, you will be entered to win a trip to the 2013 Electronic Entertainment Expo.

2174
02:54:03,349 --> 02:54:05,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's not irritating or anything.

2175
02:54:05,811 --> 02:54:13,012
[SPEAKER_06]: because E3 is a very exclusive thing to be able to get into, but apparently you can win your way in through Amex.

2176
02:54:14,533 --> 02:54:17,453
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad that the integrity is being kept up.

2177
02:54:17,493 --> 02:54:31,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I'm so glad that we're keeping the independent press out of the events for the nasty, filthy things they'll say about it on the internet, yet we're going to let a contest winner from American Express get their way into the show.

2178
02:54:32,556 --> 02:54:33,276
[SPEAKER_06]: I see how it is.

2179
02:54:35,273 --> 02:54:35,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Is DRM going too far?

2180
02:54:49,950 --> 02:54:51,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I'm reading the story here real quick.

2181
02:54:51,471 --> 02:54:51,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me look at this.

2182
02:54:53,613 --> 02:54:55,974
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a forum post, okay?

2183
02:54:56,755 --> 02:54:59,276
[SPEAKER_06]: He links us to a forum post on overclock.net.

2184
02:54:59,697 --> 02:55:05,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Razer Synapse 2.0 software mouse unusable if you don't have an internet connection.

2185
02:55:06,121 --> 02:55:15,848
[SPEAKER_06]: ThePoster, who goes by ChannelX99, just bought a new Naga 2012 mouse, installed the software, and got greeted by a login screen right after.

2186
02:55:16,288 --> 02:55:22,532
[SPEAKER_06]: No option to bypass it to use the software to configure the mouse, set the options, sensitivity, shortcuts, macros, etc.

2187
02:55:22,892 --> 02:55:24,774
[SPEAKER_06]: So I create an account and try to log in.

2188
02:55:25,034 --> 02:55:25,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing.

2189
02:55:25,754 --> 02:55:26,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Try several more times.

2190
02:55:27,315 --> 02:55:27,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing.

2191
02:55:27,996 --> 02:55:29,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Try to make new accounts.

2192
02:55:29,137 --> 02:55:30,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Different email addresses won't work.

2193
02:55:31,158 --> 02:55:36,402
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a stupid That's completely awful I would be writing a letter to the Better Business Bureau Which I'm about to be doing for Origin

2194
02:55:59,373 --> 02:56:03,736
[SPEAKER_07]: DR, you can't... Do they sell counterfeit mice?

2195
02:56:03,876 --> 02:56:05,678
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, is that a thing?

2196
02:56:05,958 --> 02:56:10,641
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to get political, but I'm honest to God, this is the first thought that jumps into my mind.

2197
02:56:11,021 --> 02:56:14,904
[SPEAKER_06]: There's this very controversial proposition on the ballot in California.

2198
02:56:14,944 --> 02:56:19,367
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Prop 37, and it has to do with labeling certain types of food.

2199
02:56:19,887 --> 02:56:23,190
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to get into where I'm leaning on this proposition or whatever.

2200
02:56:23,230 --> 02:56:33,078
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to say if it passes, there's going to be additional warning labels on food and restrictions on what can be called a natural food or not.

2201
02:56:34,399 --> 02:56:38,623
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason why I bring that up, that mouse ought to carry a fucking sticker on it.

2202
02:56:38,903 --> 02:56:39,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Bright and big.

2203
02:56:39,904 --> 02:56:45,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Will not work without an interconnect connection because you, the buyer, have the right to know that shit before you buy it.

2204
02:56:47,372 --> 02:56:48,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Take the mouse back, buddy.

2205
02:57:04,127 --> 02:57:04,548
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.

2206
02:57:25,611 --> 02:57:30,314
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate to sound stupid and I might by saying this but I don't care.

2207
02:57:30,654 --> 02:57:40,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Shouldn't there be like antitrust shit involved because you're forcing somebody to log up for your crap because you bought this particular product at the store.

2208
02:57:41,342 --> 02:57:49,788
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like you're making somebody sign up for this other service because of your foothold in the mouse keyboard.

2209
02:57:50,488 --> 02:57:52,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't there a questionable legality to that?

2210
02:57:54,045 --> 02:57:59,153
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, maybe because we're talking about a mice and keyboard company that's kind of a niche market at gamers.

2211
02:57:59,173 --> 02:58:01,177
[SPEAKER_06]: They do have their $2,500 laptop that's coming out this week as well.

2212
02:58:01,197 --> 02:58:01,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

2213
02:58:08,466 --> 02:58:08,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

2214
02:58:08,847 --> 02:58:11,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

2215
02:58:11,730 --> 02:58:15,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Tiger Klaus says, the only thing I'm doing with the mouse or keyboard is turning the LEDs on or off.

2216
02:58:16,275 --> 02:58:19,178
[SPEAKER_06]: So when I go to bed, I just load up the software to turn them off.

2217
02:58:19,539 --> 02:58:23,804
[SPEAKER_06]: All other features it has, I don't use because that's mostly features associated to gaming.

2218
02:58:25,565 --> 02:58:28,849
[SPEAKER_06]: One more tweet from Actdeft who says, Fairy Solitaire.

2219
02:58:29,910 --> 02:58:32,671
[SPEAKER_06]: is free to download on Steam for a few days.

2220
02:58:33,951 --> 02:58:34,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knew that?

2221
02:58:35,372 --> 02:58:36,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Get it now, keep it forever.

2222
02:58:37,312 --> 02:58:51,437
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want the addicting card game Fairy Solitaire where you find and raise a fairy pet and repopulate the magical land of Avalon using the resources found by clearing each level, sounds like you can get that on Steam for free right now.

2223
02:58:52,197 --> 02:58:57,724
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, you should, even if you're not really that interested in it, if you're mildly interested, because, hey, it's free.

2224
02:58:58,325 --> 02:59:00,267
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I'm giggling there, but you know what?

2225
02:59:00,688 --> 02:59:02,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Props to them making it free.

2226
02:59:04,332 --> 02:59:05,634
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure it's better than Yaris.

2227
02:59:08,217 --> 02:59:11,481
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a very low bar to exceed there.

2228
02:59:13,436 --> 02:59:19,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, that's going to do it for our Twitter topic tonight and the other interactive parts of our show.

2229
02:59:21,188 --> 02:59:22,790
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to close up shop.

2230
02:59:24,907 --> 02:59:26,729
[SPEAKER_06]: And did Skype just, like, freeze my computer?

2231
02:59:27,950 --> 02:59:28,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Skype.

2232
02:59:28,891 --> 02:59:30,972
[SPEAKER_06]: You dropped the live listeners and everything.

2233
02:59:30,992 --> 02:59:32,233
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, that was Skype's fault.

2234
02:59:32,293 --> 02:59:33,655
[SPEAKER_06]: That was not Comcast's fault.

2235
02:59:33,675 --> 02:59:34,575
[SPEAKER_06]: That was Skype's fault.

2236
02:59:35,216 --> 02:59:36,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry for the stream drop there.

2237
02:59:37,458 --> 02:59:41,701
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, anyhow, that's going to do it for telephone calls and Twitter and all that good stuff.

2238
02:59:42,022 --> 02:59:43,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's end the show.

2239
02:59:43,703 --> 02:59:45,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any other last-minute stories either, you guys?

2240
02:59:45,705 --> 02:59:46,445
[SPEAKER_02]: I have something to say.

2241
02:59:46,685 --> 02:59:47,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, what?

2242
02:59:47,186 --> 02:59:50,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Tomorrow is my mom's birthday, so happy birthday, Mom, even though you don't listen.

2243
02:59:50,489 --> 02:59:52,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy birthday to DarkSakura's mom, even though she doesn't listen.

2244
02:59:53,091 --> 02:59:53,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

2245
02:59:54,318 --> 02:59:55,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, any last minute stories or anything?

2246
02:59:56,360 --> 02:59:57,362
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about a slow news week.

2247
02:59:57,382 --> 02:59:58,283
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have anything.

2248
02:59:58,643 --> 03:00:00,906
[SPEAKER_06]: MXC in chat says, don't knock it.

2249
03:00:01,006 --> 03:00:04,590
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried playing Fairy Solitaire on a whim and can't stop playing.

2250
03:00:04,650 --> 03:00:05,992
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been three hours.

2251
03:00:08,835 --> 03:00:10,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I have another thing to say.

2252
03:00:10,337 --> 03:00:10,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

2253
03:00:10,637 --> 03:00:11,378
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll say it for last.

2254
03:00:12,119 --> 03:00:13,140
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to quickly say this.

2255
03:00:13,420 --> 03:00:20,705
[SPEAKER_06]: Shane, if you're listening and you're in chat, will you link the listeners that game you were talking to me earlier on Warcraft about?

2256
03:00:21,205 --> 03:00:22,206
[SPEAKER_06]: It was hilarious.

2257
03:00:22,246 --> 03:00:23,947
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish he'd called in to talk about it.

2258
03:00:24,007 --> 03:00:25,408
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounded hilarious.

2259
03:00:25,868 --> 03:00:30,452
[SPEAKER_06]: You start playing the game and it looks like an edutainment title that's about fractions.

2260
03:00:30,832 --> 03:00:36,656
[SPEAKER_06]: But then he was talking about how it gets weirder and weirder and weirder.

2261
03:00:37,256 --> 03:00:45,301
[SPEAKER_06]: and weirder and suddenly you're at the top of this government conspiracy and it turns into a text adventure game.

2262
03:00:46,102 --> 03:00:50,425
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried playing it for 30 seconds and I'm like, I don't get the joke.

2263
03:00:50,525 --> 03:00:51,506
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a stupid game.

2264
03:00:51,606 --> 03:00:52,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Close window.

2265
03:00:52,586 --> 03:00:56,629
[SPEAKER_06]: But then he was telling me about it on Vent and I was laughing because it sounded really ridiculous.

2266
03:00:56,869 --> 03:01:03,774
[SPEAKER_06]: So if he's not listening, I'll get the link from him and we can talk about it next week because Loki, I think you of all of us should probably play this game.

2267
03:01:03,814 --> 03:01:04,935
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like something you'd get a kick out of.

2268
03:01:04,955 --> 03:01:05,475
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds awesome.

2269
03:01:05,595 --> 03:01:06,976
[SPEAKER_06]: You like flash games that are weird.

2270
03:01:07,758 --> 03:01:15,438
[SPEAKER_06]: all right um okay let's go around and get everybody's final thought Jamie you had something in mind already so I'll start with you tonight your final thought I'm gonna wreck it

2271
03:01:17,784 --> 03:01:20,445
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought tonight is Baked Potato.

2272
03:01:21,205 --> 03:01:22,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

2273
03:01:23,726 --> 03:01:24,467
[SPEAKER_07]: Mob Arena.

2274
03:01:24,607 --> 03:01:26,107
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully they'll be coming soon.

2275
03:01:26,487 --> 03:01:29,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, check out the map that we have for the VOG server.

2276
03:01:29,889 --> 03:01:31,609
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're not part of it, you should join.

2277
03:01:32,630 --> 03:01:34,410
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fun, and you get to build stuff.

2278
03:01:34,450 --> 03:01:40,092
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you want to check out the map, vogmc.co.cc, and you can check out what we're building.

2279
03:01:40,853 --> 03:01:41,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Peek in.

2280
03:01:42,613 --> 03:01:44,776
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2281
03:01:44,836 --> 03:01:50,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys so much for downloading our show or listening to us live, however you choose to participate with Orange Lounge Radio.

2282
03:01:50,521 --> 03:01:51,542
[SPEAKER_06]: We really appreciate it.

2283
03:01:51,602 --> 03:01:53,864
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know we've said this a lot, but it is true.

2284
03:01:54,205 --> 03:01:55,366
[SPEAKER_06]: We're an independent show.

2285
03:01:55,666 --> 03:01:56,847
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't ask for anything.

2286
03:01:57,208 --> 03:01:59,290
[SPEAKER_06]: Please just tell a friend or two.

2287
03:01:59,330 --> 03:02:00,251
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess this is something.

2288
03:02:00,271 --> 03:02:01,772
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we don't ask for money and stuff, but...

2289
03:02:02,953 --> 03:02:03,613
[SPEAKER_02]: I like money, though.

2290
03:02:03,634 --> 03:02:04,474
[SPEAKER_02]: You could just give it to me.

2291
03:02:04,914 --> 03:02:07,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell a friend or two or five about the show.

2292
03:02:08,036 --> 03:02:09,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Help spread the word.

2293
03:02:09,557 --> 03:02:14,820
[SPEAKER_06]: The voting in the podcast towards we talked about earlier, that's a great way to do that, but there's other ways to spread the word, too.

2294
03:02:15,180 --> 03:02:15,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell a friend.

2295
03:02:16,161 --> 03:02:17,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Give us a nice review somewhere.

2296
03:02:17,782 --> 03:02:19,383
[SPEAKER_06]: Help spread the word of Orange Lounge Radio.

2297
03:02:19,403 --> 03:02:21,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get some other voices in the community.

2298
03:02:21,104 --> 03:02:24,406
[SPEAKER_06]: We had some great discussion tonight on a lot of different topics.

2299
03:02:24,426 --> 03:02:25,126
[SPEAKER_06]: This was a good show.

2300
03:02:25,166 --> 03:02:26,627
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a very grown-up show, Ryan.

2301
03:02:26,647 --> 03:02:28,727
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a very grown-up show, so we need some more voices.

2302
03:02:28,747 --> 03:02:30,708
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a special episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

2303
03:02:30,728 --> 03:02:31,008
[SPEAKER_06]: It was.

2304
03:02:31,048 --> 03:02:32,028
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a very special one.

2305
03:02:32,068 --> 03:02:33,368
[SPEAKER_06]: Vote or P. Diddy will kill you.

2306
03:02:33,428 --> 03:02:33,848
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

2307
03:02:33,928 --> 03:02:35,929
[SPEAKER_06]: And vote or P. Diddy will kill you.

2308
03:02:35,969 --> 03:02:38,569
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, we're talking about the podcast voice.

2309
03:02:39,969 --> 03:02:42,550
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we mean the election on Tuesday.

2310
03:02:42,570 --> 03:02:44,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Get your friends to vote, too.

2311
03:02:45,090 --> 03:02:45,590
[SPEAKER_06]: For both.

2312
03:02:45,670 --> 03:02:46,391
[SPEAKER_06]: More the merrier.

2313
03:02:46,471 --> 03:02:46,851
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

2314
03:02:47,091 --> 03:02:47,311
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2315
03:02:47,551 --> 03:02:48,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, you guys.

2316
03:02:48,291 --> 03:02:49,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a wonderful night.

2317
03:02:49,111 --> 03:02:51,431
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you next week to do this all over again.

2318
03:02:52,112 --> 03:02:53,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's the closing music?

2319
03:02:55,796 --> 03:02:57,140
[SPEAKER_06]: for your consideration.

2320
03:02:57,261 --> 03:02:58,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Best gaming podcast.

2321
03:02:58,846 --> 03:02:59,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Here it is.

2322
03:02:59,347 --> 03:02:59,708
[SPEAKER_06]: Good night.

2323
03:03:00,942 --> 03:03:03,964
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

2324
03:03:04,604 --> 03:03:08,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.

2327
03:03:26,455 --> 03:03:27,395
