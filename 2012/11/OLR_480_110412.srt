00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,780
Tonight, November 4th, 2012, Sony reports a loss of close to $200 million.

2
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:24,600
Details emerge on Nintendo Network Premium, and one vice president of a retail gaming

3
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,760
company pleads guilty to embezzlement.

4
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,180
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

5
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,360
where every gamer has a voice.

6
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:45,420
It is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 480 for this November the 4th of 2012.

7
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:50,000
I hope for those of you guys that go out and do stuff on Halloween, you had a good Halloween,

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,300
and I can't believe it, but now is that time of year where we start seeing all the Christmas

9
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:58,920
stuff show up in stores and all that fa la la la la la la, and I'm sure wanting to comment

10
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,960
on that is the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

11
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:07,560
I still haven't seen any Hanukkah stuff, and Hanukkah is like two weeks before Christmas.

12
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,080
It's just, it's not fair.

13
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:17,160
I think that it's bigotry, it's prejudice.

14
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:24,280
To be fair, I haven't seen any Festivus polls, so they're hating on Festivus 2, so.

15
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,280
Oh my god.

16
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,280
Anyhow.

17
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,320
I just saw a funny thing in chat, so I'm not gonna say it because I'm not talking about

18
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,320
politics.

19
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,320
Alright.

20
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,320
Thank gosh.

21
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,320
Alright.

22
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,720
Also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

23
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,720
Hi.

24
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,720
How are you, Loki?

25
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,720
I'm fine.

26
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,720
Excellent.

27
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,720
What's new with you?

28
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,720
How was your week?

29
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,720
It's been alright.

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,720
Yeah?

31
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,720
Lots of Minecraft.

32
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,720
Lots of Minecraft.

33
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:49,240
You were showing me, okay tell me about this little thing you were, this was cool, this

34
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,400
map thing you were showing me before the show.

35
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,400
How does that work?

36
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,920
How can our listeners check this out?

37
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,920
You can check it out.

38
00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,520
This new website I made for the VoG Minecraft server, it's basically because I get free

39
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,440
website hosting for having the Minecraft server being hosted by this company, and I needed

40
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:14,800
a webpage to put this map plugin on, so it's, if you go to vogmc.co.cc, and that will pull

41
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:23,840
up the, it's a plugin called dynamic map, and basically it's almost in real time.

42
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,600
There's a little bit of, there's some glitches, like I've noticed a few blocks not updating,

43
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:33,560
but it's pretty much in real time, and it shows just everything that's on the server.

44
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:40,680
You can take a peek and see what people are building, and just kind of how things look.

45
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,080
Maybe get you interested in joining up on the server, because it's fun.

46
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,360
So we've got that, but yeah, check it out.

47
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,040
You can even see when people are playing, you can see them moving around and where they're

48
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,520
at and stuff like that, and you can watch chat, so it's kind of fun.

49
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,940
That's kind of neat, that you can do that all live, and I like being able to see kind

50
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:03,200
of the, like, just isometric view, and I even found my house on there, you helped, but I

51
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,600
was able to find the house and all that stuff.

52
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,120
Yeah, I haven't gotten around to labeling everything yet, like some people's places,

53
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,080
I don't know who built them, you know.

54
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,680
I know, I was like, Loki, what's that?

55
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,680
I don't know.

56
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,680
Loki, what's that?

57
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,680
I don't know.

58
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,540
It's like, I've seen that there, I just don't remember, and there was one time I did see

59
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:22,300
who built it, but I don't remember who it was, because they were standing there, idling,

60
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:28,000
and I just, I didn't remember, because some people are not, you know, responsible enough

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,200
to label their houses with signs, so I know who's, you know, building what.

62
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,980
Your roller coaster is epic too, by the way.

63
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:36,980
It's pretty large.

64
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,980
I haven't ridden it yet.

65
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,980
I'm still not going to play it until someone buys it for me.

66
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,020
But I, what she's not going to tell you is that when she saw the map and was looking

67
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:46,300
at everything, she was like, okay, maybe I do need to play this.

68
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,860
No, no.

69
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,460
She's starting to turn around a little bit.

70
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,460
Yeah.

71
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,460
Loki's magic is working a little bit.

72
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,540
I'm going to put my foot down, when someone buys it for me, then I'll play it.

73
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,740
All right, well, maybe Hanukkah Harry will bring you a copy.

74
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,540
I'd rather have the N7 hoodie.

75
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,540
All right.

76
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,140
Um, let's see, other kickoff topics I wanted to talk about tonight.

77
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,480
I did not realize, Loki, you did not go see the big movie that everybody in the gaming

78
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,700
world's talking about this weekend, Wreck-It Ralph.

79
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,700
What stopped you from going?

80
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,700
You see all the big new movies.

81
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,100
No, I don't actually.

82
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,100
You usually do.

83
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,100
I used to before I had a kid.

84
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,700
Oh, is that, well, this is a kid's movie, sorta.

85
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,540
Well, I just, I didn't get a chance to go see it.

86
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,060
I mean, I still want to see it, but it's just, I haven't gotten to go see it yet.

87
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,060
All right.

88
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,380
Well, I thought I'd start off with this topic tonight cause a lot of people talking about

89
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,380
this movie.

90
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,380
It was good.

91
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,380
It was good.

92
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:42,380
Wreck-It Ralph, uh, was the top of the box office this weekend and made 49.1 million.

93
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,940
That is the estimate for on today, Sunday, the day we are recording.

94
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:50,340
And apparently they're crediting its performance, which was very good.

95
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,820
It's the highest Disney animation classic opening ever.

96
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,920
I want to note it was, even though it looked like a Pixar movie, it was not a Pixar movie.

97
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:03,860
So it did not beat all the Pixar movies, but it did be all of the Disney classics, which

98
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:08,380
includes Tangled, which was also kind of that same animation style.

99
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,260
If you saw that movie, but it made 49.1 million, at least that's the estimate.

100
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:17,760
Now the interesting thing is they are crediting Hurricane Sandy for some of the reason why

101
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,660
it did so well, because a lot of kids didn't have school on Friday.

102
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:26,380
A lot of people wanted to just get away, you know, out of the nightmare that they'd been

103
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,800
living the past week and go see a movie.

104
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,700
So they're actually saying it was part of the reason it had a little bit of a boost.

105
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,700
But I don't know.

106
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,820
I mean, I, I just know a lot of people that I know were really interested in seeing this

107
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:43,080
movie and it really did seem like the type of thing that was geared at families as well

108
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,620
as, you know, it had the classic stuff was great.

109
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:52,820
The references, if you caught them, I have to go see it again.

110
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,860
I'm going to try to phrase this without spoiling it.

111
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,860
I saw it too.

112
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,940
And I had a great time.

113
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:02,300
And I think the great thing about it is that, well, obviously I like two things and we talk

114
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,420
about it a lot on this show, video games and Disney.

115
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,460
And this movie was really both.

116
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:15,100
The neat thing about it is that it wasn't really about the video games.

117
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:20,220
It was, but it wasn't like, there's a lot of people asking, why isn't Mario in the movie?

118
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,060
Why is Bowser in the movie and not Mario?

119
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,980
And the real answer is that he's expensive, but I think there's another layer to it.

120
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,220
And that is if Mario had been in the movie, it would have been kind of distracting because

121
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,880
this movie is not about Mario.

122
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,740
It's about these made up characters that exist in this universe with all the characters that

123
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,020
we love.

124
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,820
So I kind of think it was neat that it was this very traditional Disney story.

125
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:46,700
And for all practical purposes, it was pretty formulaic for the rest of the Disney movies.

126
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,700
Not that that's a bad thing.

127
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,900
But you know, it was kind of what you'd expect from a Disney movie.

128
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:58,540
But it took place in this universe that co-exists alongside Street Fighter, Qbert, you know,

129
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,220
Sega games, all these other things.

130
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,860
What did you think about them going to the Tapper?

131
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,620
Oh, I thought that was great.

132
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,620
Yeah.

133
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,780
I thought about you when I saw that.

134
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,780
Where they reference Tapper.

135
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,740
And one of my friends sitting next to me was like, is Tapper a real game?

136
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,060
I'm like, oh, my God, how old are you?

137
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,980
I'm like, I'm way older than you.

138
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,860
I remember Tapper when it was in the arcades.

139
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,860
Dan completely jumped at the and I'm not going to say any more than this, the road blasters.

140
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,860
Mm hmm.

141
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,860
Yeah.

142
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:31,980
And we thought of what the the one thing was supposed to be a reference to as far as another

143
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,980
game.

144
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:33,980
It actually was related to another game.

145
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,340
Rally X.

146
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,340
Oh, yeah.

147
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,340
Yeah.

148
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:41,140
So and there was lots of little references and I don't want to spoil everything, but

149
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,780
I will say, if you haven't seen the movie yet, you plan on seeing it soon.

150
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,860
A stay till the very, very, very end of the credits.

151
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,860
Yes.

152
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,140
For a little, you know, like most movies, it's not a big thing, but it's one of those

153
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,940
things that when you see it, you'll be like, oh, that's clever.

154
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,940
That's funny.

155
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,940
L.O.L.

156
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:01,820
And then also, crap, what else is I going to say?

157
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,820
I don't know.

158
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,820
The graffiti.

159
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,660
Keep an eye out for the various graffiti.

160
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,280
There's so many little jokes on the side.

161
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:13,100
And actually, you can see Princess Peach and Princess Toadstool like totally in the movie,

162
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,860
but they're like in the background.

163
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,860
It's it.

164
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,860
But it's them.

165
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,860
It's totally.

166
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,540
There was the one scene with the one walking with the two with Chinley walking with the

167
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,260
two princesses, but neither of them were.

168
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,860
Peter, I think one of one of them was in blue.

169
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,860
I think one was day.

170
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,860
Oh, probably Pauline.

171
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,860
Yeah.

172
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,860
Yeah.

173
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,860
And Pauline.

174
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,860
So very interesting.

175
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,500
Let's go to our chat room.

176
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,140
I'm being a very bad boy and I did not introduce our chat yet, but we do love our live chatters.

177
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,300
We love the podcast listeners.

178
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,540
We also have the people that join us live every Sunday night at the voice voice of Geeks

179
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,980
Network or vog network dot com.

180
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,900
We do tape live every Sunday night at six Pacific and nine o'clock Eastern right after

181
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,140
the Bobby Black Wolf show.

182
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,700
And we have a live chat room that you can chat along with us at live dot vog network

183
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,140
dot com.

184
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,380
And Game Guru in chat says it was Daisy and Rosalina.

185
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,380
That's the name.

186
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,380
I couldn't think of her name.

187
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,380
It was Rosalina.

188
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,460
Pauline was Donkey Kong.

189
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,460
Yeah.

190
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,860
Pauline was Donkey Kong, but I thought they retroactively made her a princess or something.

191
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,220
I thought there was some retcon.

192
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,660
She was wearing pink.

193
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:16,620
It's like the same thing where everybody's like, oh, Leia is a Disney princess now.

194
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,740
Leia is a Disney princess.

195
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,540
That's the way I just think that that's funny.

196
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,540
Hold on.

197
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,540
Put the brakes on that chat.

198
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,740
We'll get there in a minute.

199
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,660
But meanwhile, let's see.

200
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:29,580
Dan Shadow in our chat room says, I hate end credits crap.

201
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,180
I hate end credits crap.

202
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,900
Do you hate end credits crap?

203
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,660
I love it.

204
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:39,580
I actually make a habit of staying through the credits regardless, because I think that

205
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,300
a lot of people behind the scenes put a lot of hard work in the movie and that's sort

206
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,140
of my nod to them and that.

207
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,140
And I hear good music.

208
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,540
I check the soundtrack listings.

209
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,100
I downloaded the soundtrack in the theater.

210
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,140
I had a room, AKB 48.

211
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,100
I had a roommate in college that was very much like you, where it was like whenever

212
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,860
we would go to see the movies, it's like, nope, we're not leaving till after the credits

213
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,860
was over.

214
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,660
And it was nothing about bonus scenes or anything like that.

215
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,860
It was just, no, we're going to watch the entire movie.

216
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,960
And I was like, all right, I guess everybody's got their thing.

217
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,960
You don't want it.

218
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,060
You don't want to get the jump on getting out of here.

219
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,060
Get parking lot.

220
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,060
All right.

221
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,060
All right.

222
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,060
We'll stay and watch the credits.

223
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,060
It's fine.

224
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,060
So I think that's that's fine though.

225
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,060
Let's see.

226
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,740
What is to see some people talking about the wizard.

227
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:25,340
Raginator says, so Wreck-It Ralph was about as much about video games as the wizard was

228
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,540
then.

229
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,620
In a funny way, yes.

230
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:34,980
I kind of don't like acknowledging that that reference works because the wizard was a very

231
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,280
different type of movie.

232
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,540
And for all practical purposes, let's be real.

233
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,020
It wasn't a very good movie.

234
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:45,420
We just, we remember it being awesome because we were kids and it had that look at Super

235
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:51,100
Mario three and you know, the power glove, it's so bad and all that like commercial shit

236
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,220
that's like, you know, shoved down your throat.

237
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,380
Wreck-It Ralph didn't really have that.

238
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,900
Like Wreck-It Ralph wasn't the Wii.

239
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,900
It wiggles.

240
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,620
Now I did see a Wii U commercial in the theater before the movie.

241
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,500
That's the only time I've seen a Wii U commercial.

242
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,940
Somebody was asking, they only have one.

243
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,980
Somebody was asking on Twitter today, like, why are there not Wii U commercials on TV

244
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:07,980
and all this stuff?

245
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,780
I'm like, I saw one in the movie theater.

246
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,860
Putting it before Wreck-It Ralph seems like a nice place to do it.

247
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,860
You know what?

248
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,900
They did this thing for Cartoon Network live TV shows.

249
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:23,060
And my husband was like, I miss that commercial that ran for five years with What's-Her-Face.

250
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,060
What was it?

251
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,060
The Closer?

252
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,060
Or something?

253
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,620
But then they showed the Ultimate Geek trailer because you know how lately, I don't know

254
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,660
if every theater in America does this, but at least all the ones around here do.

255
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,500
They have that thing called the Fathom Events where it's like the Metropolitan Night at

256
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,500
the Opera or I think Riff Tracks does their stuff through Fathom Events.

257
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,580
But here's the big thing they're doing at the end of November.

258
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:49,220
They're doing two episodes of Star Trek The Next Generation in HD.

259
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,220
People cheered.

260
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,700
And everybody in the theater cheered.

261
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,700
And we're like.

262
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,700
Because it's geeks.

263
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,420
This one is DS9, bitches.

264
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,740
But just for the record, I still want to go to that.

265
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,740
Just saying.

266
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:07,140
We need to make plans November 29th because I love Star Trek The Next Generation.

267
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,140
All right.

268
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,140
Let's see.

269
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,140
What else?

270
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,620
What else did I want to say about the movie?

271
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,620
I don't know.

272
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,220
I liked it quite a bit.

273
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:19,900
You know, again, it's not like shoving the video games in your face, but I'm really glad

274
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:24,340
that this part of pop culture is just.

275
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,920
It's there and it's being acknowledged without it being niche.

276
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,220
And it's really cool now that, you know, I think there's a lot of parents out there who

277
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,340
remember a lot of these games from when they were younger.

278
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,780
And now we need a TV series, right?

279
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:41,380
Well, it will be interesting to see if the movie continues to do well.

280
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,980
I heard it had a very large budget, so it has a lot of money to make up.

281
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,460
But if the movie does well, which, you know, if it's had a bigger opening than Tangled

282
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,060
and there's really not a lot of competition for the movie coming till Thanksgiving, it

283
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,500
stands to do pretty well.

284
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,180
It will be interesting to see, does this mean sequel?

285
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:01,480
Does this mean Disney Park integration is possible?

286
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,680
They're putting a Tangled thing into Disneyland.

287
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,400
The expanded Fantasyland is going to have a Tangled section to it.

288
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,060
So could Wreck-It Ralph come to Tomorrowland?

289
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,940
Could the arcade, you know, which is kind of a bummer because I was hoping it would

290
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,940
be Tron, but I do love it.

291
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,940
Let's hope.

292
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,940
Let's hope.

293
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,940
I hope.

294
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,940
I don't doubt the other world.

295
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,900
All right, let's quickly talk about the other nerd news that came out this week before we

296
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:31,500
get into video games, because this does affect video games a tiny, tiny bit, but I am positive

297
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,660
you all have heard this, but if for some reason you've been just like locked away in a nuclear

298
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:42,340
fallout shelter for the past, you know, week, Disney bought LucasArts this week and they

299
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:46,900
paid what, $4.5 billion for it and promptly announced they're making Star Wars Episode

300
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:51,260
7 and obviously this meets hugely mixed fanboy reaction.

301
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,740
Did you hear the other side of that?

302
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,700
Lucas turned around and donated the money to education.

303
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,420
He said he's going to donate it to education.

304
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,420
He hasn't done it yet.

305
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,540
He just announced plans to.

306
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:04,180
By education he means an educator, which is Indiana Jones, which he owns, but it's just

307
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,180
donated to himself.

308
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,980
Well, I don't want to be morbid, but does that mean he's going to die?

309
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,100
Because like, isn't that a little weird that he's like offloading it all?

310
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,740
Well, he's probably just ready to retire.

311
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:19,060
He's keeping his Marin properties.

312
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:27,180
So the game developing building and his ranch, the Skywalker Ranch, is staying under his

313
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:32,580
property, including everything that's on it, but the company itself, because he wanted

314
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,860
to build a movie theater in Marin County and all the people with their nose in the air

315
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,300
said, well, it is Marin County.

316
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,300
Yeah.

317
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,040
So, so I think that had something to do with it, but yeah, one story.

318
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,400
But no, no, no, it's fine.

319
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,400
But here's the thing.

320
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,840
Besides the Star Wars thing, which personally, I thank God somebody took it away from Lucas.

321
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,840
Let's be real.

322
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,000
Indiana Jones.

323
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,680
How can it be worse than the prequels?

324
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,640
How will it possibly be worse than the prequels?

325
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,880
I don't care if it is Mickey and Goofy, you know, which it won't be.

326
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,880
We all know it won't be.

327
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,080
How can it possibly be worse than the prequels?

328
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,280
There was a statement too that it's changing the canon from the books.

329
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,680
Well, I seem to remember.

330
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,680
Who reads books nowadays?

331
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,080
Well, it's not a lot of people that are in those days.

332
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,480
I realized that they, people want those Star Wars books to be adapted, but I seem to recall

333
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,620
around the time the prequels came out, there were many interviews with George Lucas where

334
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:31,080
he said, when he did the first trilogy, he always planned for there to be three trilogies

335
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:36,060
and the recurring characters that would be an online movies would be C3PO and R2D2.

336
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,440
And there'd be a trilogy before the original trilogy and there'd be a trilogy after the

337
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,000
original trilogy.

338
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,160
And he always said that it was going to be nine movies.

339
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,020
But then when he was making the prequels, he was like, you know what?

340
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,840
I don't think there's going to be anything else after this.

341
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:56,040
But now that he's actually the creative consultant or whatever, my thought is Disney's going

342
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,320
to take his outline for the nine movies or the seven, eight, nine movies and make that

343
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,320
which...

344
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,320
Better dialogue.

345
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,320
Yeah.

346
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,360
And he told, it's out there that he talked with Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher last year

347
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,360
about this.

348
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,320
They're way too old to reprise the roles unless it's way set in the future.

349
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:21,360
Or they said that Luke Skywalker could be the Obi-Wan Kenobi type of the new movies

350
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,000
and that would make a lot of sense.

351
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,300
But the reoccurring characters would be C3PO and R2D2 because they're androids, they don't

352
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,300
die.

353
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,440
And that makes a lot of sense.

354
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:38,040
But I'm curious enough, anyhow, sorry, I didn't mean to get on a movie tangent.

355
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,960
The big thing is that if they're going to, I mean, for them to realistically have those

356
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:49,600
people play the same characters, they're going to have to change the book canon anyway.

357
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,600
Which honestly, the book canon was going way too crazy and I couldn't even deal with it.

358
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,520
Rageinator says, how can it be worse?

359
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,640
This is how episode seven can be centered around Jar Jar.

360
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,640
It can't.

361
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,320
Seven will be after the original trilogy.

362
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,000
Jar Jar will be dead.

363
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,120
In fact, I want to point this out.

364
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,040
If you think that Disney's going to fuck up Star Wars, you need to go ride the new Star

365
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:16,040
Tours ride because the best ending on that's because you know, the Star Wars ride has the

366
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,180
multiple endings.

367
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:21,360
The best ending is the one where they go to Jar Jar's planet because somebody, somebody

368
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,520
shoots him.

369
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,100
Disney shot Jar Jar and you all are pissed.

370
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,640
By the way, Rob, your nerd logic doesn't make sense.

371
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,640
Let it go.

372
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,640
By the way, I finally got Hoth.

373
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,640
Oh, did you?

374
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,640
It was awesome.

375
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,640
Yeah, it is awesome.

376
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,280
The ice plan is the best.

377
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:42,360
But anyhow, uh, let's see, uh, that, uh, that, uh, that, uh, YYR says Star Wars episode seven

378
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,640
begins with the assassination of Jar Jar Binks.

379
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,640
You're welcome.

380
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,680
Uh, no, he won't be in it at all.

381
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,960
They're just going to look past it.

382
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,800
Uh, as you want to get gunk and live for hundreds of years, SSJ 100, Matt says, just please

383
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,520
don't have JJ Abrams direct the next three.

384
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,060
That would be weird because that's like the crossing the streams thing.

385
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,260
You don't cross Trek and Wars.

386
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,880
Like I've seen a lot of people campaigning for Zachary Quinto to be a villain in Star

387
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,880
Wars.

388
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,160
He can't, he's locked into Trek and I just, I think there is this nerd thing.

389
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,820
You don't cross Trek and Wars.

390
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,820
You can't do it.

391
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:20,060
However, it is completely hilarious to sing Star Trek in, in line for Star, Star Wars.

392
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:23,780
Just saying, especially when you get the cast members singing along with you.

393
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:28,900
Um, let's see, uh, the Rob D says Han and Leia's kids have a complete story.

394
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,900
Seriously.

395
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,800
The books go so far into the future that the story of their kids has been told.

396
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,360
I think it would make a lot of sense.

397
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,560
I swear we'll get to games.

398
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,860
I brought this up to talk games and I'm talking movies and I'm always more of a Trek fan than

399
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:40,860
a Wars fan.

400
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:46,140
But I think it would make a lot of sense for the Star Wars next trilogy to be about the

401
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:51,880
children of Luke Skywalker because the books that were about Han and Leia's kids, but that

402
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,260
doesn't mean it has to be on the books.

403
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,260
Get away from the book.

404
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,260
The books are not being turned into movies.

405
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,260
Mara Jade is in it.

406
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,260
I'm happy.

407
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,260
The books will not be turned into movies.

408
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,260
Period.

409
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,260
Mara Jade needs to be in it.

410
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,620
You're stretching it.

411
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:07,300
That may happen only because they ended up calling one of the planets Kors Kont in the

412
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,300
prequels because that came from the books.

413
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,300
Yeah.

414
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,300
So they also referenced it in, I think the first one.

415
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,300
Oh, anyway.

416
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:17,700
Uh, Tiger Claw says, how about Joss Whedon directing Star Wars?

417
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,700
I could go with that.

418
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,780
Um, I think while that would make a lot of nerds happy, why don't you give him the time

419
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,420
to do all this stuff with the Avengers?

420
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,020
Like he's one guy.

421
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,500
He can't, he can't do everything nerd.

422
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:35,340
Um, I would, I'd like to see some of these, um, Oh God, I'm going to get, I'm going to

423
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:39,240
get so much shit for this, but I think it would be really cool to get somebody like

424
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:44,660
one of the, um, uh, Harry Potter directors that made the really looking forward to Tim

425
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,660
Burton's adaptation.

426
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,460
No, no, no, no, no.

427
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:53,660
Alfonso Cuaron who did the third, um, Guillermo del Toro, although he didn't do a Harry Potter

428
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,660
movie, but he's, you know, Pan's Labyrinth and all the stuff he does.

429
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,660
Yeah.

430
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,660
All right.

431
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:02,500
Look, the quick thing I wanted to say, and then I swear we'll get to video games.

432
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,940
This is about video games.

433
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,660
When Disney bought Lucas arts, they didn't just buy Star Wars.

434
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,660
That's all everybody's talking about.

435
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,460
Cause they announced Star Wars episode seven, but they, what do they get with this?

436
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,780
They get Indiana Jones, they get American graffiti, ha ha ha.

437
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:25,280
They get all the Lucas arts games belong to Disney now, although I kind of doubt Disney's

438
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,320
going to do anything with it.

439
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,320
Maniac mansion.

440
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,320
That's right.

441
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,580
Disney now owns maniac mansion.

442
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,040
I doubt they'll do anything with it, but they did say they were very interested in developing

443
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,880
the games in the mobile and social space.

444
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:43,880
I would love to see an animated maniac mansion movie, but they'll probably continue to contract

445
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,080
with other developers to do Star Wars on the console.

446
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,400
Now if we're talking like Tim Burton, that is a movie that Tim Burton would be perfect

447
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,040
doing maniac mansion.

448
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,240
Oh, that would be awesome.

449
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,800
And uh, Oh, good points in our chat room.

450
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,640
Dan shadow says ILM.

451
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,640
That's very true.

452
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,800
Tiger class says Skywalker sound.

453
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,240
So Disney picks up all that.

454
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,240
That's great.

455
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:10,520
And again, I'm just going to say, how can it get, how can it get any worse than it already

456
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,520
was?

457
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:19,120
And what I mean by that is if you have played that Star Wars connect game, have you played

458
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,120
that Star Wars connect game?

459
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,880
I just, because I'm smart enough to know that it's terrible.

460
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,480
I just want to remind you be quiet advertisement.

461
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,680
I just want to remind you of a little sequence that's in the, uh, in the star Wars connect

462
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,680
game.

463
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,040
And that is the dance battle to I'm Han solo.

464
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,520
Let me play a little clip of that.

465
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,520
Just there's a bunch.

466
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,240
All of the songs are easily terrible.

467
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,140
Just to remind you how bad things can be.

468
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,140
Just want to remind you that here

469
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:49,900
have you seen this board?

470
00:21:49,900 --> 00:22:03,140
Our saga, this star Wars connect game

471
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:06,080
and that's going to get worse under Disney.

472
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,060
It can't get worse at famous last words.

473
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,460
It can't get worse.

474
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:18,540
Disney owns the rights to Howard, the duck, however, they actually do own Howard, the

475
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,340
duck because they own Marvel.

476
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,340
All right.

477
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,340
Rageinator says, just wait.

478
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,300
Disney will buy the rights to rock your picture show next.

479
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,580
And then they'll blend star Wars and rock your picture show and sky would probably squeak.

480
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,980
No, that wouldn't happen because that would involve buying 20th century Fox.

481
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:39,980
And I think, I think there's laws set up for that big of an acquisition.

482
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:40,980
Let's see.

483
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,980
Rama says.

484
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,540
Disney makes Marvel a former shell of itself.

485
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:47,380
Oh, oh yeah.

486
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,340
Disney really fucked up Marvel with that Avengers movie.

487
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,220
They were, oh yeah, that, that was terrible.

488
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,780
Oh, and Disney really fucked them up.

489
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,780
It's over.

490
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,780
Yeah.

491
00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:02,860
That new Muppets movie was really bad compared to the last couple dot, dot, dot.

492
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,340
Is your mic off?

493
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,340
My mic was off.

494
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,340
Sorry.

495
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,140
Now they just need to buy the mega moon franchise.

496
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,140
Yes.

497
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,140
Yes.

498
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,300
And blizzard.

499
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,300
Okay.

500
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:19,100
Now, God, this is why I miss my old mic cause it didn't have an off switch, but, um, the,

501
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,980
the whole thing I wanted to point out too, is that don't worry anything about Indiana

502
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,980
Jones.

503
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,060
It doesn't matter who has, first of all, I don't want to see another Indiana Jones movie

504
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:30,420
because it can only be Harrison Ford and he's too old.

505
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:33,140
We saw this plus that crystal school thing.

506
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,140
Shit.

507
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,860
Disney still has licensing rights to Indiana Jones.

508
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:41,180
How else are they going to have, you know, the ride for one thing.

509
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:44,660
How else are they going to have all of the merchandise that they sell at Disneyland?

510
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:47,580
And on top of that, they have the pinball table.

511
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:52,700
This is how Indiana Jones, Indiana Jones will come again, but it's going to be in about

512
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:58,900
10 to 15 years after the Indiana Jones is what Disney will do after the trilogy is done.

513
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,920
And that's going to be a good 10 years away.

514
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,260
They're going to do Indiana Jones next and it will be the good old fashioned Hollywood

515
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,660
fix it reboot.

516
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,660
Just wait for it.

517
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:09,100
I do not want a Shia LaBeouf reboot.

518
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,060
I want a good actor.

519
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,820
Just saying good reboot could put a good actor in the role.

520
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:18,220
Just saying, but as long as it needs to be done after we're all dead.

521
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,220
All right.

522
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,940
Too much movies, not enough games.

523
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,580
Let's talk about video games again.

524
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,860
We always like to start off the show, you know, 30 minutes into it with how was your

525
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,980
gaming week?

526
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,060
Let's talk about the video games that you've been playing this week.

527
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:30,060
Dark soccer.

528
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,060
We'll start with you.

529
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:36,100
Well, you know, I actually, uh, didn't get to play much cause I started a job, have a

530
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,100
job now.

531
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,100
Congrats.

532
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,100
Thank you.

533
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:46,180
Um, and, uh, I, uh, I downloaded a demo for a game that I'm going to talk about in part

534
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:51,200
B. Um, I never got a chance to play it cause I've been working, um, but I've been playing

535
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,580
a bunch of, uh, mass effect two cause I beat mass effect one earlier.

536
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,420
Finally did everything in the first mass effect.

537
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:01,340
So it wasn't that you had played the demo cause you didn't play the demo cause you were

538
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,340
working.

539
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,220
You didn't play the demo cause you were playing mass effect two.

540
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,500
It has to be real.

541
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,620
Just it's, it's okay.

542
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:11,880
And I logged into wow long enough so I wouldn't get booted from the guild.

543
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:17,820
I haven't touched like wow more than long enough to say hi to people since and oh, and

544
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,380
for the record, I still can't get in my mass effect three.

545
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,700
Just saying, that's still a thing.

546
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,700
Yeah.

547
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,700
I watched that.

548
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:30,700
Um, that mod ending, it was, yeah, somebody actually bad.

549
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:35,140
Somebody actually made a mod that will change the ending to the happy ending.

550
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:39,820
They call it the mass effect three happy ending and I clipping issues though.

551
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:43,920
Well, the thing that cracked me the fuck up is that they inserted video footage obviously

552
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:48,540
from other places in the game, but some of them had an IGN watermark and I was like,

553
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,540
really?

554
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,540
If yes, really?

555
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:53,660
No, I mean that was what I was thinking really, really.

556
00:25:53,660 --> 00:26:01,620
And on top of that, most of the footage of the space battle thing is from the low preparedness

557
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,620
thing.

558
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,620
Whatever.

559
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,500
The, the, yeah, I know what you're talking about.

560
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,500
The universe rating.

561
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,500
Yeah.

562
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,060
Cause I've watched like all the different versions of the endings to see what affected

563
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,060
what.

564
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:16,660
And yeah, that's like from the super low I did shit where the Normandy explodes and everyone

565
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:17,660
dies ending.

566
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,660
I was like, really?

567
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,700
This must be happy ending, huh?

568
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:27,700
It was, it was interesting to see it pulled off, but I'm not ready to install it.

569
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:33,060
I like my destroy ending, you know, that's Canon in my head.

570
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:37,680
It's very impressive to me that people can mod the ending and like that, that's like

571
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,740
a thing now to like mod the ending to make it the way you want.

572
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:44,860
And I'm just like, Oh my God, the new trilogy can't get here fast enough.

573
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,780
So people have something new to bitch about.

574
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:51,320
Well, the whole thing is, is it in theory, I know how it can be done cause really it

575
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:56,600
would be changing code to insert sequence for pre-rendered stuff and screens for all

576
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,920
of the little, uh, flashbacky things.

577
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:06,720
Um, and then it was, uh, uh, it would actually be taking preexisting animations and loading

578
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,580
different textures over them, which by the way, that picture of, of Jacob's face over

579
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:16,280
Garris's body is absolutely hilarious because he has his mouth expanded.

580
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,800
Like it was for the whole Garris face.

581
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,040
That sounds strange.

582
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,040
Very strange.

583
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,880
Have you ever seen them done for, um, smash brothers?

584
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,880
No.

585
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:33,120
The, uh, the, you can swap, uh, swap the textures and the different characters on, um, on, uh,

586
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,120
smash brothers.

587
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:38,660
And it changes the actual size and body shape of the character to where you have like a

588
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:42,160
Kirby with, you know, a princess peach with a huge mouth for Kirby.

589
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:46,680
Well, yeah, I saw that one, um, mod or whatever that Loki was talking about a couple of weeks

590
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:51,560
ago on the show that changed all the characters to other gaming franchise characters.

591
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,560
But that was it.

592
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,560
Yeah.

593
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:57,080
This, this is just like, you have a different frame for the animation, which in Mass Effect

594
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:01,800
is actually a lot easier because they all use a human skeleton, but, um, not so much

595
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,800
in, uh, smash brothers.

596
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:08,280
So anyway, uh, the Rob D in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says I'm over Mass

597
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,280
Effect 3.

598
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,880
There's too much else to enjoy to continue bitching about Mass Effect 3.

599
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,140
Ain't that the truth?

600
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:20,420
And a multiplayer is really great in Mass Effect 3 if it works well on Xbox.

601
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,420
It's been great.

602
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,420
All right.

603
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,940
Anyhow, uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

604
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,300
Uh, it's basically Minecraft.

605
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,980
I mean, that's what I was doing most of the week.

606
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:34,920
I finally got the option to, um, switch the server to a bucket server, which is a server

607
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,220
that allows mods.

608
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,220
So that's what I did.

609
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,460
I have it running on a bucket server now.

610
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:47,100
So aside from the, uh, dynamap, um, thing that I talked about before, uh, we also have

611
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:52,180
now world edit, which is kind of cool for, you know, making, uh, structures and stuff

612
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:55,820
really fast and also for like leveling mountains and that kind of fun stuff.

613
00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:01,860
So we have that and a mob arena, which I'm setting up right now, a, uh, a, uh, PVE arena

614
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:07,940
where you can fight waves and waves of monsters, just to kind of get a little bit of that survival

615
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:12,340
element in there, because right now we're just playing creative and it'd be fun just

616
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:15,580
to have something to do, you know, just take a break from building stuff.

617
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:20,400
You can fight waves of monsters and it's going to get really wacky because you can put like

618
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,400
anything you want in there.

619
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,780
Like you can make a boss monster.

620
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:27,680
That's a chicken that fight, no launches fireballs or like really crazy stuff.

621
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,780
So we've got, got a lot of work to do on that.

622
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:37,020
And then, um, I played a little bit of a call of duty this week and, uh, hopefully we'll

623
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:42,940
be playing black ops two in a couple of weeks here and that's pretty much it.

624
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,100
I think I haven't really played a whole ton this week.

625
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,100
Yeah.

626
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,100
I'm kind of in the same boat as you.

627
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,380
I haven't played a whole ton this week.

628
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:51,980
Um, uh, more world of Warcraft, which, you know, I'll talk about on Horde house, the

629
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:56,140
other show a little later this week, but a little preview, a followup for those of you

630
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:59,900
that do listen to Horde house, our guild did take down the first raid boss.

631
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,900
Finally.

632
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:01,900
Yay.

633
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,900
Puppies are dead.

634
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,820
And the trick was use three healers instead of two.

635
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:08,580
The minute we ran it with three healers, we had it down in three polls as opposed to like

636
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,900
the 20 before that.

637
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,900
So that was the trick.

638
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,900
Um, and then I did play some aspect three multiplayer, not to make this a mass effect

639
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:19,580
show, but they did have the Halloween challenge, which I thought was really cute because they

640
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:24,740
modded the game to make like the little, the little beacons turned into pumpkins and the

641
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:28,780
little devices that you did the upload from were all little pumpkins and you know, they

642
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,780
did that.

643
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:32,740
And then you had these certain little mini achievements that you get the new banner,

644
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,740
which I thought that was a pretty hefty reward because it's really hard and you have to play

645
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:39,100
a lot to get a lot of those banners, but the Halloween challenge unlocks a banner.

646
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,740
So I was like, Ooh, I want to get a banner for no particular reason.

647
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,280
My E P needs it.

648
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,280
So I did that.

649
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,900
So, um, yeah, that was the Halloween challenge.

650
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,420
Um, screw that Vanguard challenge though.

651
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:53,060
I'm not doing that one cause I don't really like Vanguards as much as all my friends seem

652
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,060
to.

653
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,220
And that was really it for games.

654
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,960
I didn't have a chance to play a lot of new stuff.

655
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:02,600
I will say I took a trip to Dave and busters yesterday cause I was in the Bay area hanging

656
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:08,280
with some of my friends and I went to Dave and busters and you know, I got to see like

657
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,320
that infinity blade arcade machine, which I didn't really play it.

658
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,320
You know, I didn't, Oh, this is the next next iPad.

659
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,320
Yeah.

660
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,320
Yeah.

661
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:23,000
I'm, I'm too addicted to, um, the wheel of fortune, which, and the, it's the quiz game.

662
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,000
It's that damn quiz game.

663
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,640
I don't know if every Dave and busters has it, but it's like the giant quiz machine with

664
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,640
the three buttons.

665
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,120
Oh, we just sit there and play that for like an hour.

666
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:38,160
Just keep putting the tickets in and, or the swipe in the card and um, I don't believe

667
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,040
they have a DDR machine anymore.

668
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,040
They didn't.

669
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,040
Well, Dave and busters never did.

670
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:46,160
They always only had pump it up, but they replaced it with a giant connect for machine.

671
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,640
That's like, it's like, Oh my God, the thing is so bright.

672
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,000
You can see it from space.

673
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,240
It's crazy.

674
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,720
So it's just connect for whatever.

675
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,920
I think the one by S has an X two.

676
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,920
Yeah.

677
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,920
Yeah.

678
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,600
They don't have pump.

679
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,600
I don't think.

680
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,600
Hmm.

681
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,600
Interesting.

682
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,600
But yeah, that was, that was really it for games.

683
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,520
I didn't really, um, I have 11,000 tickets at Dave and busters though.

684
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:12,000
I am really close to having enough for a PlayStation three game, a new one, although I almost bought

685
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,160
Alan a new grill and an indoor grill yesterday because I could have got one of those for

686
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,160
9,000 tickets.

687
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,160
You know what?

688
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,040
What I actually did use my tickets to buy appliances there.

689
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:24,560
Did you, I got, um, a, uh, rice cooker that I actually used to make quinoa in and it's

690
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,560
wonderful.

691
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,560
Nice.

692
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,560
Uh, Misty's asking me if this is the Dave and busters in Roseville.

693
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,080
No, I actually went over to the Bay area.

694
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,280
I went to the great mall in Milpitas cause we had to do outlet shopping cause I needed

695
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:35,640
new shoes.

696
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,120
But anyway, that's for another show.

697
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,160
Uh, so that was my gaming week.

698
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,360
Not a whole lot of new stuff.

699
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,720
Just a lot of old classics, uh, debating, picking up halo four this week though.

700
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,280
I got to admit, you know, I've skipped all the little halo side games.

701
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:53,000
I bought original halo, halo two, halo three, skipped all the side games.

702
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,720
Didn't think I'd buy halo four, but I don't know.

703
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,760
There's a part of me that's four is pretty awesome.

704
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,760
I don't want it.

705
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,720
I mean, see, that's the same way as I only played three was the last one I played, but

706
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,360
you got to figure, you know, reach in recon and all that stuff.

707
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,360
Those kind of like prequels type, you know, that I don't really think you need to play

708
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,320
that cause it's basically a sequel to three and if you play three then cool.

709
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,320
Yeah.

710
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,320
All right.

711
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,320
Yes.

712
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,560
Master chief wakes up after a long time.

713
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,480
I mean, that's pretty much kind of, it depends.

714
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,840
Well, a lot of it depends on what, what, what friends of mine are going to be playing halo

715
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:27,520
four because halo two was the best because I played it with my college buddies that,

716
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,000
you know, and this was a little bit after college and that game first came out and that

717
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,520
was kind of a, we would have our night that we would all play halo two and it was just

718
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,520
us, no strangers.

719
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:38,200
And we had a great time when I went to halo three, that kind of fell apart.

720
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:44,560
And so it was mostly strangers and halo three and I was kind of like, eh, eh, having my

721
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:49,280
ass handed to me by strangers isn't as much fun as when it's people, you know, you know,

722
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:55,720
uh, um, yeah, bonds bonds double six in our chat room says I just did halo one, two and

723
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,840
three never did the ODST in wars.

724
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,840
Yeah.

725
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,840
Same.

726
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,840
I'm in the same boat, buddy.

727
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,840
Uh, Raginator asked kind of a random question.

728
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,160
I'll answer this and then we'll go into, um, uh, housekeeping and news.

729
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:11,440
Um, Raginator asks, Rob, say, have you ever used the games for windows marketplace before?

730
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,440
I ask, cause I'm wondering if you can use Ms points on there or do you actually have

731
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,240
to use actual dollars and cents?

732
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,360
Um, maybe one of the other listeners can correct me.

733
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:23,400
I believe it's all dollars and cents on the marketplace.

734
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,940
I don't think they use the points.

735
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:30,400
The only games for windows, if I did download it to get that free game tinker or whatever

736
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:35,920
it was that was in there and when I was really into game room, you had to have games for

737
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:39,640
windows for the games that you bought that played on both platforms.

738
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,900
But that's really about my extent of knowledge of game for windows live.

739
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:46,280
So I don't know how the points work there.

740
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,680
I think Microsoft across the board is moving to regular currency.

741
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:56,500
I don't think you see the Microsoft points in the windows eight marketplace for instance.

742
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:00,000
So I think Microsoft transitioning away from that.

743
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,460
Um, although bonds double a six says I have used the games for windows and they will use

744
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,520
your Ms points.

745
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,520
So maybe I'm wrong.

746
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,840
I thought they were transitioning away from that though.

747
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:13,020
So maybe it's one of those do it while you can.

748
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:17,240
I'm sure though that if they do decide someday to just get rid of Microsoft points, they'll

749
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,240
convert you.

750
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,640
You can convert them somehow into like $80 to a dollar.

751
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,600
Exactly.

752
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
It won't be that difficult.

753
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,040
So I wouldn't worry too much about it.

754
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,040
Okay.

755
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:30,200
Um, quick housekeeping and then we'll get into tonight's news.

756
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:34,360
So um, we were going to have a interview tonight with Eddie from Bahmani style.

757
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,880
He needed to postpone that.

758
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,320
So if you did not see the message on Twitter, that interview will not be happening tonight.

759
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,560
I apologize if you were tuning in just for that.

760
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,440
I hope you'll enjoy the show anyway.

761
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,560
We are going to reschedule that.

762
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,320
I think we're doing it next week.

763
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,360
Uh, keep an eye on our Twitter for updates.

764
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,520
I will post as soon as I have that confirmed.

765
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:54,000
Twitter.com slash O L R um, real life things happen.

766
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,760
So at Eddie had to do something else tonight, but we will be welcoming him in a later week.

767
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:03,360
Uh, the other housekeeping thing I want to mention, as we mentioned in part B last week,

768
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:09,760
orange launch radio was nominated at the podcast awards, www.podcastawards.com for best gaming

769
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:15,560
podcast and we're, we're going to try really hard not to spam this like crazy.

770
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,880
We're limiting ourselves to once a day.

771
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:20,240
We're trying to be tasteful about it.

772
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:25,000
But you know, we really could use the support competition is going to be stiff, which, you

773
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,360
know, the good news is it seems like the indie broadcasts are the ones that really want it.

774
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,440
So an indie is probably going to win, which is great news.

775
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,040
Um, you know, because the Corp cast, they're like, Oh, what's this?

776
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,040
What's this little words?

777
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,040
Oh, Oh, we have money elsewhere.

778
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,080
Oh, we don't need to, so they don't even bother promoting it.

779
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,760
But you know, the Indies are, are really, I'm trying to get the vote and hopefully that's

780
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,680
a really good sign that one of them will win.

781
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:52,880
Of course, we would love to be the ones that win because it's great exposure.

782
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,640
And that's really, you know, why we're trying to get people to get out the vote for us because,

783
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,520
you know, because we don't have those big websites behind us.

784
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,500
We don't have a big marketing campaign.

785
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,560
We don't make money off this show.

786
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,880
It's just really a great way for us to leverage some promotion.

787
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:13,480
So remember, you can vote once a day between now and November 15th, www.podcastawards.com

788
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,560
and we are nominated in the best gaming category.

789
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:19,580
Don't forget, if you give them an email address, that's not one that you often check.

790
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:23,180
Be sure to check it once every 24 hours because you have to verify your vote because they

791
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,220
want to make sure you're a real person.

792
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:30,760
And please do not do anything that would get us disqualified by doing something shady.

793
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,320
So keep it legit.

794
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,920
Keep it real y'all.

795
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:38,040
And most importantly, even if you're not going to vote for OLR, please consider keeping it

796
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,080
indie because the indie podcasts need it.

797
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,080
All right.

798
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,880
What else do I want to say for housekeeping?

799
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,440
Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio and Google Plus.

800
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,440
We're on there as well.

801
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,600
Please join our communities on there.

802
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:58,120
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Launch Radio on vognetwork.com,

803
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,800
use the passphrase, random.

804
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,200
Let's get into some gaming news.

805
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,720
Loki, start us off.

806
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:04,800
All right.

807
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,560
So let's talk a little bit about 38 Studios.

808
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:13,800
I know everyone's familiar with the whole debacle with, you know, kingdoms of Amalur

809
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,440
reckoning and all that stuff.

810
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:23,640
Well now apparently the people that were behind the whole $75 million loan for 38 Studios

811
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:28,120
are being sued by Rhode Island.

812
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,480
And it's kind of interesting.

813
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:33,160
So they're actually going after, what was it?

814
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:42,040
It was, you know, Kurt Schilling and CEO Jennifer McLean.

815
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:50,840
And I guess also the former Economic Development Corporation Director Keith Stokes and Wells

816
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:55,080
Fargo Securities and Barclays Capital.

817
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,360
So Barclays used to own the company I worked for.

818
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,360
Yeah.

819
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,360
So they're going after them.

820
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:04,280
And they said, you know, I know you work hard for your paychecks and for your tax dollars

821
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,760
to be squandered is unacceptable.

822
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,320
The board's legal action was taken to rectify this grave injustice put upon the people of

823
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,120
Rhode Island.

824
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,400
And so, yeah.

825
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,640
So they're going after them for money.

826
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:22,880
And I don't know, hopefully they get it.

827
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,880
It's be interesting.

828
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,560
They're just trying to kind of recoup any losses that they had because they're out sending

829
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,960
$75 million right now.

830
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:34,080
You know, I'm not going to pretend to know the first thing about investment or like how

831
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,560
the money worked out in this whole mess.

832
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:42,040
So I am not going to be one of those pundits that's like, yeah, take them through the ring

833
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:45,440
or get them through all their worth or, you know, or the other extreme, because I really

834
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,080
just don't know.

835
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:52,880
I just find this shit fascinating that, you know, the state of Rhode Island is out this

836
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,880
money.

837
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,200
It's not some private company.

838
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:04,240
The state is out a large amount of money because of the failure of a video game company.

839
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,760
That just kind of blows my mind in a way.

840
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:11,580
It's really unfortunate because it would probably make people hesitant to invest in other video

841
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,580
game companies.

842
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:17,840
But I don't know, it just blows my mind.

843
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:21,000
The Rob D in chat says, Kurt Schilling will need to sell everything.

844
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,280
I feel bad for everyone involved.

845
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,560
Mack Deft follows that up with yeah.

846
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:32,080
And the Rob D follows that up at live.vognetwork.com says Kurt Schilling was an idiot, but he

847
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,440
didn't have evil intentions.

848
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:38,100
Dark Sakura followed that up with he'll need to sell $10 blow jobs.

849
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,100
Don't be immature.

850
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,100
Don't be immature.

851
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,100
Exactly.

852
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:45,200
To recoup those kind of losses, he's going to have to sell $100 blow jobs.

853
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,080
Well, I was just thinking $10 so that he'd actually get business.

854
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:55,240
The Rob D, again, some good comments in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says he has

855
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,880
to pay for his idiocy though.

856
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:01,040
Actions have consequences.

857
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,560
Kurt Schilling was just trying to make a video game that ever, I mean, obviously he was a

858
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,900
big EverQuest fan, a big WoW fan.

859
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:11,120
He wanted to make that game, but probably, I mean, let's be real.

860
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,840
He was a baseball player.

861
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:16,560
He probably didn't really know what he was getting into.

862
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,760
I mean, it's kind of sad.

863
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:25,160
I don't think the game was that bad, but the thing is, it's just not a lot of games do.

864
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:30,360
Millions and millions of copies sold and to just count on your game being like a tent

865
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:34,040
pool AAA title, it's huge, huge, huge, huge.

866
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,380
It's not really realistic.

867
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:41,000
But the whole thing, all that being said, it blows my fucking mind that he was given

868
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,760
the money in the first place.

869
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:47,560
Because somebody wrote him that check.

870
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,920
Is it because of the sports fame?

871
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,680
Is it because we're so fixated on sports in this country that it's like, oh yeah, when

872
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:58,680
sports royalty walks in and wants to do something, we let them do it.

873
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,360
Is that what's to blame?

874
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,960
Is that sports royalty in our culture?

875
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,640
I'm pretty sure that in certain counties in California, like Hollywood and stuff like

876
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,760
that, you could probably kill a man and get away with it.

877
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,680
They give you a gimme and you know, that's it.

878
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,400
But so like, you know, it works for it works for OJ.

879
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,400
Yeah.

880
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,400
Say five million dollar loan.

881
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,600
I mean, that's that's like, ah, you're good for it.

882
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,640
You're a baseball star right now.

883
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,480
You know, there's no possible way we're going to lose on this.

884
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:32,240
S.H.O. 100 Matt in our chat says it was because he was Curt Schilling.

885
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,980
So you're saying I'm right?

886
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,980
Question mark.

887
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:40,240
Well, keep in mind, this is the same country that's letting a, you know, a convicted rapist

888
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:49,580
go free, you know, and is the director, the movie director, I what?

889
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:53,040
Nevermind that Paul W.S. Anderson, I swear.

890
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,120
All right.

891
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:58,200
And Tiger Cloth follows it up saying, yeah, it's got to be because he was a baseball player

892
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,560
and the fact he was a World Series winning baseball player.

893
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:07,420
So anyhow, let's just like no one give like, you know, basketball stars this kind of money

894
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:12,260
either for game ideas, because would they have given that money to Dennis Rodman?

895
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,660
We did have Shaq Fu.

896
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:22,300
Hey, I wonder if Shaq Fu sold as many copies, if not more copies, then, uh, yeah, at least

897
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,060
Shaq Fu recovered its costs.

898
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,180
Maybe Shaq Fu is a concept I can get behind.

899
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:29,460
Shaq Fu did not put Rhode Island seventy five million dollars.

900
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,340
Shaq Fu is harmless.

901
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,820
Well, pretty harmless.

902
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:36,460
Shaq Fu just put me seventy five minutes of my time into debt.

903
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:37,460
That's all.

904
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:39,060
It's not as big of a loss.

905
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:42,620
Oh, I remember the game I wanted to talk about during my gaming week before we get into this

906
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,860
next thing, since we're talking about basketball.

907
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,500
Do you know what I saw at the mall?

908
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,680
A demo kiosk for NBA baller beats.

909
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,900
And I so badly, that looked awkward.

910
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:56,100
I so badly wanted to play it, but I was with my friend Victoria and she was judging me

911
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,100
so hard.

912
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:58,100
Listen, you're too white for this.

913
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,280
You're too white for this.

914
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,700
You're not going to do that.

915
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:01,700
Basically.

916
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:04,780
And thanks to SSJ100 Matt, it was Roman Pileski.

917
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:07,140
Oh, that whole thing.

918
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,140
Oh, yeah.

919
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,620
That's that's a bit of a mess, isn't it?

920
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:17,220
Anyhow, NBA baller beats, I got to say, say what you will say what you would judge me

921
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,220
all you want.

922
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:20,280
I don't give a fuck.

923
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:21,280
It looked fun.

924
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:22,280
I'm sorry.

925
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,500
It looked fun.

926
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:33,420
I can get my boss to give me the copy that we have because it's just sitting there on

927
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,420
his desk.

928
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,620
I'm not going to lie.

929
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:37,900
I'm just waiting for it to go in the clearance bin.

930
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,060
I'm going to check much longer.

931
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:41,740
I'm going to check fries once a week.

932
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:44,260
It'll be a manager special before we know it.

933
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:49,940
They even have them for sale there like, nope, nope, nope.

934
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:50,940
All right.

935
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:51,940
Moving on.

936
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:54,140
Rhode Island's not the only one that's lost money.

937
00:44:54,140 --> 00:45:00,700
Sony talking about their finances made a net loss of fifteen point five billion yen.

938
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:06,180
That translates to just under two hundred million dollars in their second fiscal quarter.

939
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:09,980
Their gaming division has seen a year on year decline in profit.

940
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:14,180
This is a year on year reduction in loss of forty two point six percent.

941
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:17,500
That's an improvement over the three hundred and twelve million dollars they lost during

942
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:20,700
the first quarter.

943
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:25,700
The company is lowered their projections for the end of the year for the PSP and the Vita

944
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,740
sales significantly.

945
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:30,140
That's down to ten million from what they originally projected.

946
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:34,380
I don't think they're going to come out too well this year, to be honest.

947
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:39,500
Kaz Hirai in May indicated a fiscal year estimate of ten million for the Vita alone.

948
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:44,920
The PS3 and the PS2 combined estimate remains untouched at sixteen million.

949
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:50,720
On the bright side, software performance saw slight growth across the second quarter.

950
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,660
So the PS3 and PS2 sales, they've actually rose slightly.

951
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:56,420
Well, let me just look at the fourth quarter line.

952
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,220
They don't really have any strong titles.

953
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:01,060
They have PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, which could flop.

954
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:05,640
I mean, it's all right, but it's not going to be like, you know, Uncharted or something

955
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,700
like that.

956
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,540
And they've got Little Big Planet Karting, which also could flop.

957
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:14,340
I mean, those are both like kind of mediocre, you know, as far as like Triple A titles go,

958
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:17,500
they're not like Mass Effect or Halo.

959
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:21,720
It's just kind of like, huh, you know, they'll do all right, but they're not going to be

960
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:25,840
these huge games that people are like, oh, my God, I'm going to line up at midnight to

961
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,400
go get my PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale.

962
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:29,400
That's a very good point.

963
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,400
That's a very good point.

964
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:34,780
These games are not Halo 4 or like that was that they have the new Sly Cooper game, Thieves

965
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:38,760
in Time around and one of those anyways.

966
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,360
So those aren't really that strong titles.

967
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:43,280
And look at what we have for the Vita, like the two big games that they've been kind of

968
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,880
pimping for the Vita was Call of Duty, Black Ops Classified, which I'm afraid is going

969
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:48,880
to suck.

970
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,020
In fact, I'm pretty sure it's going to suck because the guys that made it were the guys

971
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:56,380
that made the really shitty Resistance game that they were also pimping out really hard

972
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:01,420
and was very mediocre in Assassin's Creed, which I think Assassin's Creed Liberation

973
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,420
is actually pretty good.

974
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:06,820
But the Call of Duty game, the one that they're kind of banking on, you know, selling the

975
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:09,420
Vita, they even have bundles for it and stuff.

976
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,420
It's just it's going to be mediocre.

977
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:13,740
It's going to get poor reviews.

978
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:15,620
Here's the thing.

979
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:20,460
If Sony is losing this money and Sony is not really selling Vitas like they thought they

980
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:24,740
would, do we really think we're going to get a PlayStation 4 next year?

981
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:26,900
Do we still think that's something that's going to happen?

982
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:31,980
Because I'm I'm really starting to think a lot of this stuff that we're hearing about

983
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:35,100
game industry troubles, because this is not the first we've heard of this.

984
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:37,800
We've heard about layoffs, et cetera, et cetera.

985
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:42,580
Could this have the domino effect of maybe not having a new system or do it?

986
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:45,540
Does it make it more urgent that we need a new system to get us out?

987
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:49,980
I think if anything, I think we're going to have probably a new system soon, like as soon

988
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:53,860
as at the end of next year, because that's why we're seeing this kind of development

989
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:54,860
cycle.

990
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:58,720
We are seeing, you know, these games that are they're all right, but they're not like

991
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,380
these big, you know, launch tentpole titles or something like that.

992
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,380
It's like a new uncharted.

993
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:08,380
I mean, they have a new uncharted last year, but it's not like a big, huge title like that.

994
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:13,660
I think that they're having these dev teams working on something for the next system.

995
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:18,600
So they have a strong launch because they know they need that.

996
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,600
It's hard to say that.

997
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:23,880
I think that they're going to have to probably drop the price of the Vita pretty soon, because

998
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,720
there's not a whole ton of stuff that's really like a selling point.

999
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,520
Like had I not gotten one, there's not really anything that would have sold me on one.

1000
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:34,120
Although if they announce a portable Grand Theft Auto 5 game, I'm probably going to have

1001
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,400
to buy that.

1002
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,080
Any Grand Theft Auto game, I probably have to buy.

1003
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,280
I don't really care what system it's on.

1004
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,340
YYYR in our chat room says, I played LittleBigPlanet Karting in New York Comic Con.

1005
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:44,340
There were no lines.

1006
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:48,840
It was actually quite fun, but I walked away thinking, will I pay $60 for this?

1007
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:49,840
No.

1008
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:54,800
Rob D says at live.vognetwork.com, we absolutely need a new system.

1009
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,360
That said, we also need to reevaluate the game industry.

1010
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:01,340
The problem is that companies only change things up when we get new systems.

1011
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:04,700
You know, that's kind of along the same line I'm thinking of.

1012
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:08,740
Not so much that we absolutely need a new system, but the whole, I don't know, I kind

1013
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:12,640
of think the PS3's potential hasn't really been realized.

1014
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:18,000
Because the PS3 does 3D gaming, but is that really a thing that people are doing right

1015
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
now?

1016
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
No.

1017
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,680
So what is the PS4 going to bring us that the PS3's not doing?

1018
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:25,840
You have to understand, they've already kind of gotten away from trying to promote 3D as

1019
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:26,840
like a big thing now.

1020
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,520
It's like they don't even really mention it too much anymore.

1021
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,280
And even with 3D TVs, people aren't really sold on 3D TVs, so now they're pushing that

1022
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,920
whole 4K, you know, the Ultra HD TV.

1023
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,760
So is that going to be the PlayStation 4's big thing?

1024
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,760
Yeah, they want.

1025
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:41,760
Ultra HD?

1026
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,760
Yeah.

1027
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:46,040
I think that was one of the rumored specs, is it was going to do that 4K resolution thing.

1028
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:51,280
But if the PlayStation 3 couldn't get people to adopt 3D successfully, although, okay,

1029
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:57,400
to be fair, to be fair, Blu-ray probably won in large part to the PlayStation 3.

1030
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,400
Yeah.

1031
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,400
Yeah.

1032
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:04,040
So, I mean, for every maybe failure, you could say that there's been a win, but I'm just

1033
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:08,360
not convinced that like people are going to be like, oh, I need this PlayStation 4 right

1034
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,360
fucking now.

1035
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:16,240
Oh, and I need a new Sony Ultra HD TV as well to play what?

1036
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:20,440
Because you can think that any games that are coming out at launch are probably just

1037
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:25,880
going to be, they're probably not going to be utilizing that.

1038
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:27,720
One more, let me do one more comment here from chat.

1039
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,440
The chat's got a lot of good points tonight.

1040
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:34,160
YYR says, I really think that smartphones and the sort of success of the 3DS have killed

1041
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,920
the Vita's potential market.

1042
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:39,600
I really think it's a great system and I'm really enjoying the game library despite its

1043
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,600
small size.

1044
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:45,840
But how many people want one if they have smartphones, a 3DS or both?

1045
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,720
I don't even touch my DS at all.

1046
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,200
I play on my phone.

1047
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,920
You know, I would argue that the 3DS is kind of hurting too.

1048
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,640
I mean, we're hearing a very similar story out of Nintendo.

1049
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:59,520
It might not be as dire, but Nintendo's lowered expectations of 3DS sales as well.

1050
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:05,900
So, but I do think you're onto something that a lot of it has to do with tablets, smart

1051
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:11,580
phones, which is why when you bring out your device and you say it plays Netflix, like

1052
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:14,300
that was a waste of breath.

1053
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:21,820
The fact that your device, Wii U, plays Netflix is like, that's, that's an expectation now.

1054
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:25,780
That's like, that's as much of an expectation of it does widescreen.

1055
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:27,580
It does HD.

1056
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:28,980
It does Netflix.

1057
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,900
That's like a baseline thing now.

1058
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:40,580
So what makes your device better than a tablet or a smartphone that, you know, far more people

1059
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:42,220
have in their pockets and so forth?

1060
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:45,060
I think that's a big part of it too.

1061
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:48,100
iPad mini ain't gonna help.

1062
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,100
I can be honest.

1063
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:56,700
I mean, like I've got a smartphone and I have an iPod touch, you know, 4G and I don't really

1064
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:59,860
use either of them for gaming.

1065
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:00,860
Just don't.

1066
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:04,780
Even like my portable systems, I'm kind of reevaluating whether I even need portable

1067
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:07,700
gaming systems because I don't travel that much.

1068
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:11,220
I don't really play portable games on it.

1069
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:15,700
I mean, granted, you know, they're, they're talking about getting rid of our game room

1070
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:20,540
again because they're consolidating space and buildings and stuff, so they can lease

1071
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:21,540
out the other building.

1072
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:27,500
But you know, we used to play on the PSP because it was portable and we could get a group of

1073
00:52:27,500 --> 00:52:30,300
people together and play Grand Theft Auto and stuff.

1074
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:35,900
So you know, that may be a case where, yeah, I'd want a system like that to play like,

1075
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:40,140
you know, Grand Theft Auto or some multiplayer game so that we can kind of move around and

1076
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:42,860
stuff, be a little bit nomadic.

1077
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:48,260
But I, it's just, I don't find the need to have that stuff anymore, it seems like.

1078
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:53,460
Even like with all the systems, I don't really feel the need next generation to own all of

1079
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:54,460
the systems.

1080
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:57,900
I mean, granted, that's just be, you know, even before it felt like kind of this expectation

1081
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:00,260
because I do this show, oh, I should own all of them.

1082
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,780
I'm not really feeling it anymore because I don't play the Wii at all.

1083
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:07,300
The Wii is literally collecting dust, I have something stacked on top of it and that was

1084
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,300
it.

1085
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:12,100
We, you know, we dusted off the other day just to play Sight Truck, I should say my

1086
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:13,220
wife did.

1087
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:17,980
But like I haven't played anything on that for years now.

1088
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:22,540
And the PlayStation 3, same thing, like we're looking at maybe using the PlayStation 3 for

1089
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:26,000
Grand Theft Auto 5 because it doesn't get disconnected through our firewalls quick,

1090
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,840
but I haven't played anything on that for like a long time.

1091
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:33,080
Jamie, quick thought.

1092
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:37,140
Well, I was just saying I haven't really, I mean, Dan and I have actually talked about

1093
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:43,400
downsizing our collection, you know, because really it's anything that we've wanted to

1094
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:50,520
play, I can get on my PC and I can upgrade my PC at any point.

1095
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:54,320
It just really isn't, you know.

1096
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:59,160
And the other thing too is also looking in terms of the economy, people I think, this

1097
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:04,040
has been the case for us, are really looking at needs versus wants.

1098
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:07,760
A gaming system is a want, it's not something you need.

1099
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:13,040
We need to pay rent and that became the priority, you know.

1100
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:16,080
I didn't have, I wasn't working at the time.

1101
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:20,800
Any of my money couldn't go towards games, it went towards buying food, paying bills,

1102
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,800
you know.

1103
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,800
And in this case-

1104
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,800
Damn responsibility, damn it.

1105
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:28,880
Well, yeah, but if you look at it, the vast majority of people have been put into the

1106
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:33,680
circumstances instead of having disposable income, they're realizing that, yeah, maybe

1107
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,120
I don't need this stuff.

1108
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,280
Maybe it's just a bonus.

1109
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,720
Let me read a few more comments from chat.

1110
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:43,320
We'll end on these chat comments and go on into Dark Sakura's next story, but there's

1111
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,960
such a good discussion going on in chat tonight.

1112
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,960
I just got to throw these out there for the podcast listeners to hear.

1113
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:52,640
YYR says, the 3DS can also fall back on Nintendo's excellent software.

1114
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,120
Don't forget Pokemon.

1115
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:58,920
We haven't really had, the Pokemon games just came out or for the last DS, which is fascinating.

1116
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,960
That's how confident that they were that those games are going to do well in the 3DS.

1117
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,800
And they're probably right, to be fair.

1118
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:08,240
Dungeon Buster says, Sony's definitely thinking ahead to make the hardware flexible enough

1119
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:14,280
to adapt to what the next technologies might be, 8K televisions, virtual glasses, et cetera.

1120
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:18,060
Though most of the concepts are high up there, some techies are suggesting that the next

1121
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:23,700
PlayStation 4 might even use through silicon via for the processor architecture.

1122
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:27,220
I'm not sure, I think I butchered that sentence there, but you know, just the whole thinking

1123
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:28,220
ahead point.

1124
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:33,300
And lastly, Doom Plague says, I would be surprised if anyone made a 4K resolution game in the

1125
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,820
next 10 years.

1126
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:37,860
It's a non-factor this coming generation.

1127
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:43,000
All right, we could talk about this for a lot longer, but I think this discussion is

1128
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,480
going to be continuing through the next six months, right on up to the next E3, when we

1129
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:51,240
know what these systems, if they're coming at all for one, and what they will entail.

1130
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,600
In the meantime, let's go to Dark Soccer with the next story.

1131
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,200
How about a tale of some corporate fucking greed?

1132
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,600
Yay!

1133
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:06,600
Frank Christopher Oliveira, who is the former GameStop VP of Corporate Communications and

1134
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:13,640
Public Affairs, got caught, pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud for embezzling

1135
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:19,080
$1,965,900 from GameStop.

1136
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:25,440
And in the indictment, he sent payments from January 2009 through April 2011 to Cloud Communications

1137
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:33,080
LLC, which was a fictitious company he owned, to transfer funds into his personal account.

1138
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:39,820
So yeah, basically GameStop is like no comment, however they are fully cooperating with the

1139
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:42,560
federal investigation.

1140
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:48,480
And yeah, he actually, he pleaded not guilty, and the max sentence to this is 20 years in

1141
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,240
prison and $250,000 fine.

1142
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:56,440
And I hope that he gets the max, you know, penalty.

1143
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:01,580
I wish that all of these corporate bastards who steal money from the companies they work

1144
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:07,580
for and get away with, you know, fraud and stealing money out of the consumer's pockets

1145
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:12,400
get caught too, instead of being given, you know, personhood and all this bullshit.

1146
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:13,720
That's what I'm saying.

1147
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:15,200
People need to be held accountable.

1148
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:20,020
Funny enough, it would only take capturing about, what, about 35 more guys like this

1149
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:23,120
guy for Rhode Island to get their money back.

1150
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,440
Yeah.

1151
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:32,160
It's just another, another sign of how, you know, people in positions of power and companies

1152
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,400
are really abusing their positions.

1153
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:40,560
And in return, you know, who has to pay for, you know, recouping those losses?

1154
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:43,420
It goes back to the consumer when they're figuring out their money's missing.

1155
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:47,540
Rama makes a very tongue-in-cheek comment in our chat room, but it's worth repeating.

1156
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:48,540
Steal from GameStop?

1157
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:50,800
Sure, they've stolen from me enough times.

1158
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:57,280
Yeah, but this is, you know, a guy who probably already is a millionaire.

1159
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:02,780
You have to remember, this is a guy who was feeding money that they already got from you

1160
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:05,560
into these fake companies and what have you.

1161
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:06,560
Yeah.

1162
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:07,560
It's just amazing.

1163
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:08,640
He was able to do that much.

1164
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,480
I want them to nail his ass to the wall.

1165
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:15,600
I, I want these, and it goes back to a bigger problem.

1166
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:22,000
It goes back, you know, to more people looking at their own personal greed as opposed to,

1167
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,560
you know, being a better person maybe.

1168
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,360
Are you saying look at your life, look at your choices?

1169
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,440
Yeah, look at your life, look at your choices.

1170
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:28,440
Don't be a corporate douche-head.

1171
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:29,440
All right.

1172
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,440
Fair enough.

1173
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,440
Loki, let's move on.

1174
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:33,440
All right.

1175
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:38,060
Um, so let's talk a little bit about one game I'm very looking forward to, and that would

1176
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:39,680
be Grand Theft Auto V.

1177
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:40,680
And of course-

1178
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,680
Since when were you a Grand Theft Auto fan?

1179
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:43,680
I know, I just-

1180
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,200
You're just getting on the bandwagon.

1181
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,480
It's been a long time.

1182
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:52,040
But I'm gearing up because this month is going to be a lot of news for Grand Theft Auto V.

1183
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:54,800
I bet you suddenly became a Giants fan last week too.

1184
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:59,240
Yeah, I had to become a sports fan first, and so that's not going to happen.

1185
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:02,680
Grand Theft Auto V, of course, there was a whole bunch of rumors of when it is expected

1186
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:03,680
to come out.

1187
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:06,340
I've already said that it's going to be April and May next year, but they've officially

1188
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:10,020
confirmed that yes, Spring 2003 is going to be the release window for the game, and

1189
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:16,780
they added some promotional materials that are making it out to GameStops and other places,

1190
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:19,620
including game and stuff internationally.

1191
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:26,140
And along with that, some of the promotional stuff, starting on Monday, November 5th, you

1192
00:59:26,140 --> 00:59:29,980
can actually pre-order the game from different locations.

1193
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:34,420
The rumor was that they were supposed to be doing another trailer on the 5th, although

1194
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:38,940
because of the whole hurricane slash storm, it's put them a little bit behind as far as

1195
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:44,140
getting that trailer cut, so expect the trailer next week, which I'm really expecting for

1196
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:45,260
next week.

1197
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:50,700
And they've got some cool little promotional items if you're able to pre-order your game

1198
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:54,180
early enough, because it's going to be extremely limited in supplies.

1199
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:57,820
You can get a keychain type thing that has almost like a little viewfinder on there,

1200
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:02,540
and you can check out some of the locations, including they've got Vinewood Hills, which

1201
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:13,580
is like Hollywood, the Del Perro Pier, like Santa Monica, the Vespucci Canals, I guess

1202
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:17,100
that's, looks like kind of like a downtown LA.

1203
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:18,380
Sounds a little dirty.

1204
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:21,980
Grapeseed, which is kind of like Napa.

1205
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:23,700
Oh boy.

1206
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:24,700
So it looks interesting.

1207
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:25,700
I mean, they kind of show some-

1208
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:26,940
Because Napa's so close to LA.

1209
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:32,260
Whatever, you know, it's just like, well, San Andreas, they had San Francisco, Vegas,

1210
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:35,420
and you know, I know, I know, it's a video game.

1211
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:36,420
It's all fixed.

1212
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:37,420
It's all fictitious anyways.

1213
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:38,420
Right, right.

1214
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:42,020
And then they've got new posters and stuff like that with like a Lindsay Lohan looking

1215
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:47,140
woman on the front there, prostitute, I don't know, it's hard to tell what, which it is.

1216
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:52,700
So yeah, it's pretty awesome, and hopefully we'll learn a little bit, well, definitely

1217
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:57,100
a lot more this month, because it's the cover game for the new Game Informer, which is gonna

1218
01:00:57,100 --> 01:01:01,900
be the December issue, which is coming out in any time now, like a couple weeks, and

1219
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:08,620
also kind of their launch of their whole media campaign, so very excited.

1220
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:11,620
Trying to take your mind off of some of the holiday games that are coming out right now.

1221
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:13,260
I'm looking forward to spring.

1222
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:16,420
Well, I'm only picking, the last game I'm picking up this, well, actually I should say

1223
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:19,380
not the last game, but the second to last game I'm picking up this year is Black Ops

1224
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:25,300
2, followed by Far Cry 3, so those would be the last two games I'm getting, and then maybe

1225
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:27,260
Halo 4, I don't know, we'll see.

1226
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:31,340
Well there are gonna be a lot of people picking up Halo 4 this week, believe it or not, it's

1227
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:35,180
here, because, you know, the election day is this week, and it's the same day Halo 4

1228
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:39,940
is being released, and retailers everywhere are gonna be doing midnight releases, Game

1229
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:44,760
Stop is one of those retailers, they did announce this week 4,400 of their US locations will

1230
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:48,500
be open at midnight to sell Halo 4.

1231
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:52,620
All the stores that are participating in the event will start their events at 9 o'clock

1232
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:54,540
in the local time zone.

1233
01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:59,440
Do keep in mind, if you're in an area that was impacted by Hurricane Sandy, that may

1234
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:03,120
have screwed up some of these Game Stops, there's still a lot of places without power,

1235
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:07,900
so when in doubt, call ahead, and just make sure.

1236
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:12,480
Probably if your store did Assassin's Creed 3, it's probably doing Halo 4, but you know,

1237
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,440
it's always best to just call ahead, there's nothing wrong with placing a phone call.

1238
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:20,140
The store that you've pre-ordered your game happens to be a plan trade, you're not getting

1239
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:21,140
it at midnight.

1240
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:27,160
Alrighty then, well, I do want to point out, you know, even though Game Stop, they're most,

1241
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:30,880
there's probably a shit ton of other retailers doing the midnight release as well.

1242
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:37,560
I'm sure Walmarts, Best Buys, probably, you know, basically any place that sells video

1243
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:43,320
games will probably be open at midnight, because Halo 4 is kind of a big deal.

1244
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:48,640
Now, one other thing I want to talk about with Halo 4, is this interesting little report

1245
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:55,380
that's going around the internet this week, 343 Industries apparently not happy with some

1246
01:02:55,380 --> 01:03:01,220
of the language that players use when they're playing Halo, to which I say, good, make the

1247
01:03:01,220 --> 01:03:03,540
shit talkers take some accountability.

1248
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:09,500
The studio head of 343 Industries, Bonnie Ross, in an interview with GameSpot said,

1249
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:14,380
quote, I've seen many of the sites that have documented some of the more gender-specific,

1250
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:16,060
slanderous comments.

1251
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:20,420
This is behavior that is offensive and completely unacceptable.

1252
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:25,420
I'd like to think most of our Xbox Live players don't support this kind of behavior.

1253
01:03:27,860 --> 01:03:29,300
What are you laughing about out of there?

1254
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:30,900
Just like most of them.

1255
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:39,900
Executive producer, Kiki Wolfkill said that when the best name ever, that actually is an

1256
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:45,340
awesome name, when you give adolescents a way to broadcast opinions anonymously, that can be

1257
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:49,460
dangerous, to which I say no shit, but it's nice to see, you know, companies acknowledging

1258
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:54,540
that, the nasty side of the teenage mind will manifest itself in that environment.

1259
01:03:54,540 --> 01:04:02,300
Microsoft will do its best to seek out and ban anybody that is sharing really, really bad

1260
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:02,940
stuff.

1261
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:10,380
I'm assuming talking about someone's charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent, but in a more

1262
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:13,260
hateful way, right?

1263
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:14,980
I don't know how they do it, though.

1264
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:19,220
I'm assuming you've got to report people or it's got to be in messages or something

1265
01:04:19,220 --> 01:04:23,020
intractable because Microsoft can't exactly monitor live games, can they?

1266
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:26,780
Well, I'm sure they have maybe.

1267
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:27,860
Yeah, they might.

1268
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:28,420
I don't know.

1269
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:32,340
They do have patents for that kind of stuff.

1270
01:04:32,340 --> 01:04:37,220
And if you remember correctly, you know, not necessarily Microsoft, but EA with Kinect and

1271
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:37,900
stuff like that.

1272
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:40,940
They had a kind of similar feature in FIFA.

1273
01:04:42,020 --> 01:04:46,300
Now, I read this story at Destructoid, Destructoid.com, and they bring up a really good

1274
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,860
point that I think is worth repeating.

1275
01:04:47,860 --> 01:04:52,060
They take issue with the fact that adolescents are the only ones being targeted as being

1276
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:53,140
jerks online.

1277
01:04:53,620 --> 01:04:58,300
And they say in this article, quote, Unfortunately, there are plenty of full grown adults

1278
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:03,100
who get their jollies by going into online games and being nasty or who attempt to bully

1279
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:04,820
others because of perceived differences.

1280
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:06,580
I think that's a damn good point.

1281
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:11,180
Wasn't there a story around the Internet this week or maybe last week about the Reddit

1282
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:15,660
trolls and the people posting the really, really bad stuff to Reddit?

1283
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:20,660
And they traced it back to some thirty nine year old guy, you know, just one of your

1284
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:24,500
stereotypical basement going people with nothing better to do.

1285
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,900
And it bears to be repeated.

1286
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:30,180
Halo four is a fucking mature rated game.

1287
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:33,100
So kids shouldn't be playing in the first place.

1288
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:37,820
But parents are fucking dumb or I should say parents have made the choice to have their

1289
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:39,660
kids play this mature rated game.

1290
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:44,700
At that same time, they should also be responsible for what they say or what they're

1291
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:45,660
exposed to.

1292
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:51,660
Bonds double six in our chat room says people still cry over what's being said online in

1293
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:56,540
a game. I'm not sure if I'm taking that, like if there's like a hint of sarcasm or

1294
01:05:56,540 --> 01:06:00,540
something to that comment. But like, yes, and people should take issue to some of the

1295
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:02,140
things that are said online in a game.

1296
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:08,580
Like, I'm sorry, I've been in Halo matches where I've heard people called faggot and far

1297
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:10,620
worse words I'm not going to say on this show.

1298
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:13,380
And although they're all bad, let's be real.

1299
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:17,340
But it's just like, you know, yes, I take issue to that.

1300
01:06:17,740 --> 01:06:23,580
You know, as a gay guy who got called that a lot growing up in a very malicious way, who

1301
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:28,980
you know, still has many emotional scars, for lack of a better word, with that shit.

1302
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:32,700
Yeah, I take issue with the fact that somebody is projecting that shit onto somebody

1303
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:39,460
else. And those people should have the privilege of playing an online game taken away

1304
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:42,860
from them. Yes, you pay for Xbox Live.

1305
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:48,300
But you also accept the terms of service that you won't generally be a dickbag when you

1306
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:52,220
play online. And if you fail to live up to the terms of service, then you should have it

1307
01:06:52,220 --> 01:06:53,060
taken away.

1308
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:55,660
I don't like playing with cockbags online.

1309
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:59,260
There's been a lot of nice people I've met playing online, especially in playing Mass

1310
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:00,740
Effect, because a lot of that's co-ops.

1311
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:02,100
You don't have that same mentality.

1312
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:08,940
But, you know, and I think if you are going to call a girl who's brave enough to go on to

1313
01:07:08,940 --> 01:07:14,980
the game and talk in the first place, if you're going to call her the big C-bomb, then,

1314
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:20,820
you know, that better be a term of endearment or some prearranged thing and not in a

1315
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:26,580
negative thing, because that's not OK to be calling women at random that word.

1316
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:32,540
You know what I mean? Or even, you know, bitch, whore, slut, all those other things.

1317
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:34,260
Right, Jamie?

1318
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:36,300
I'm kind of not bothered.

1319
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:42,060
So you don't care if you go online into a random match on Halo 4 and somebody drops the

1320
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:42,540
C-bomb?

1321
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:48,660
No, I mean, because really all I'll do, like, for example, it actually happened in a while,

1322
01:07:48,660 --> 01:07:52,060
not too long ago, and all I did was just report and put them on ignore.

1323
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:52,780
What about my game?

1324
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:59,700
Well, OK, then it didn't get like get under your skin, but you recognize that, hey, this

1325
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:02,980
person should probably have their freedom to play the game taken away from them.

1326
01:08:03,260 --> 01:08:05,220
Right. This person is not mature enough to be in this game.

1327
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:08,260
Their ability to speak in said game should be revoked.

1328
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:13,540
I don't necessarily think they shouldn't be allowed to play the game because, you know,

1329
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:15,500
maybe they're good at it.

1330
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:18,660
I just think that their ability to speak should be revoked.

1331
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:23,620
I mean, because that's almost more frustrating as not being able to say something to

1332
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:30,980
somebody. And, you know, honestly, I like when you have a feature to just actively

1333
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:37,460
ignore something and then have it pop up, reverting to them, X person has you ignored.

1334
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:43,180
Then what good is saying anything going to do when the person that you're saying it at

1335
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:45,460
can't react, isn't going to react to it?

1336
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:47,860
The people are only doing that for attention.

1337
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:50,820
They're only doing that because they get something off on it.

1338
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:54,580
If you're not, if they're not bothered by it, what good is it going to do?

1339
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:59,700
I seem to remember Halo 3 had a really quick way to block people like that.

1340
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:04,180
Like, I remember reporting on some of the stories that, you know, you could just hit

1341
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:08,740
like the back button and it just shut them up automatically, which I thought was pretty

1342
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:08,980
neat.

1343
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:11,060
That's what I think it should be.

1344
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:15,700
But I think that they also need to get the feedback in return that this person isn't

1345
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:16,620
paying attention to you.

1346
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:22,180
I don't think that they should, because actually it's better if they don't know that

1347
01:09:22,180 --> 01:09:24,060
because then they can't go, oh, you're not going to listen to me.

1348
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:25,460
I'm going to send an angry message at you.

1349
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:27,740
I mean, no, it should completely block them.

1350
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:34,260
TheRobD, I think this is a very interesting point in chat, just want to throw this out

1351
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:39,860
there, live.vognetwork.com, TheRobD says, the only way we can improve the quality and

1352
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:44,500
diversity of gamers online is to hold them accountable for what they do.

1353
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:46,740
I agree with holding them accountable.

1354
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:53,900
The one problem that I'm running into with this is the fact that there's so much gray

1355
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:55,700
area for offensive.

1356
01:09:56,580 --> 01:10:03,100
I mean, having a certain list, yeah, that's one thing, you know, going too far, it

1357
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:04,500
definitely hold people accountable.

1358
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:11,180
But I'm saying that it's kind of hard for me to try to think of how to phrase it.

1359
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:16,300
There are really thin skinned people out there who, you know, even just saying, oh,

1360
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:18,900
you suck is going to piss them off.

1361
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:23,300
You know, it's going to make them, you know, be in a world of boohoo.

1362
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:26,060
And maybe if they're that thin skinned, they shouldn't play.

1363
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:28,620
I kind of I think I see what you're getting at.

1364
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:34,980
You're saying that, you know, maybe this opens the door to that total political

1365
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:38,500
correctness, hypersensitivity, these types of issues.

1366
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,460
It's like, where do you draw the line?

1367
01:10:40,580 --> 01:10:46,700
I mean, I think we can all agree you don't say certain words ever, you know, online.

1368
01:10:46,940 --> 01:10:53,700
But, you know, somebody who might be ultra religious, grew up in Little House on the

1369
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:58,500
Prairie, has every right to play the same Xbox games you do, but would never say the

1370
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:01,300
word damn themselves and might take offense to that.

1371
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:07,260
Yeah, I know people who like a lady in one of my classes who is as Mormon as Mormon can

1372
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:09,220
be, doesn't drink coffee, none of that.

1373
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:11,140
And she's perfectly fine with other people.

1374
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:15,340
She doesn't, you know, she doesn't go la la la la la when someone says crap, you know.

1375
01:11:15,820 --> 01:11:18,380
But at the same time, she won't do that thing herself.

1376
01:11:18,620 --> 01:11:23,780
And she won't put herself in a position to where she's surrounded by it all the time.

1377
01:11:24,220 --> 01:11:27,180
And now if she's in a situation that she can't get away from, she understands and

1378
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:31,220
accepts that that's a situation she can't get away with it, get away from it.

1379
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:31,820
You know what I mean?

1380
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:38,660
And my big problem, and this is actually sort of goes back to the whole big political

1381
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:39,940
correctness thing.

1382
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:40,580
You know what I mean?

1383
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:48,700
Is that there are people who do take shit way too seriously.

1384
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:52,300
Now, there's just some people who, you know, maybe in a moment of frustration, they're

1385
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:54,500
like, well, well, shit, you suck.

1386
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,220
You know, I'm just using something, you know.

1387
01:11:56,340 --> 01:12:02,620
I've heard Dan drop a C-bomb at a game and then he will stop and go, oh, my God, I

1388
01:12:02,620 --> 01:12:04,420
didn't mean to say that, you know.

1389
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:07,500
But here's the question.

1390
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:12,140
Did he say it in frustration to an NPC, the verbal equivalent of throwing the

1391
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:13,540
controller out the window?

1392
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:17,020
Or did he actually press the push to talk button and call somebody?

1393
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:18,620
He doesn't do that.

1394
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:19,460
Dan is a lot.

1395
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:23,420
Yeah, he'll go, oh, that was a fucking shit move.

1396
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:26,700
You know, when he's playing on, he plays Borderlands with his with his buddies.

1397
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:31,420
But I mean, the point with it is that I think there's a very.

1398
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:40,860
I'm trying to think of how to, there is a lot of room for.

1399
01:12:43,700 --> 01:12:46,500
Oversensitizing things, you know what I mean?

1400
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:52,620
There would be opportunity to take action against somebody that you don't like for

1401
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:58,780
other reasons, like taking advantage of it to get somebody punished just because you

1402
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:00,780
want to punish for something that has nothing to do with the game.

1403
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:01,380
Right.

1404
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:03,780
If it was going to if it was going to be.

1405
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:07,740
I would rather have a strike rule.

1406
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:10,420
I'm going to go way back and go to DDR Freak.

1407
01:13:11,740 --> 01:13:12,300
We had.

1408
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:14,420
You think the nine point system should be universal?

1409
01:13:15,220 --> 01:13:16,020
Explain the system.

1410
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:16,660
Explain the system.

1411
01:13:16,940 --> 01:13:22,300
We had a nine point rule, which basically for horrible offenses, then, yeah, they

1412
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:23,980
would get docked three points.

1413
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:26,740
And it was a three strike, three really bad offenses.

1414
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:30,100
And yeah, they got banned after nine points.

1415
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:36,060
But if there were very minor offenses, like, you know, maybe something that was

1416
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:40,060
mildly inflammatory or maybe unintentionally flaming, you know, then,

1417
01:13:40,060 --> 01:13:43,300
yeah, they got like basically a one point warn for it.

1418
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:48,020
And I don't think that it was the warnings that could go like a person could bring

1419
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:51,260
something to my attention as a moderator and then make a judgment call.

1420
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:56,540
If I got five things about one person from the same person, I'd only warn once

1421
01:13:56,700 --> 01:13:59,340
because clearly there's something more going on.

1422
01:13:59,740 --> 01:14:03,820
And if it seems like it's legit, I'll do the full three point warning for all five

1423
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:04,380
offenses.

1424
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:07,860
You know, that example, that was my mentality towards it.

1425
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:14,980
When, when you're going into, you know, if you say that you've got somebody who's

1426
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:20,940
really oversensitive playing their first round of Halo 4 forever and someone, you

1427
01:14:20,940 --> 01:14:27,780
know, just lets out, you know, oh, that was fucking cheap or, you know, makes one

1428
01:14:27,820 --> 01:14:30,940
statement, oh, you don't know how to play, you know, I'm going mild with it.

1429
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:35,740
And that person gets really butthurt and says, oh, you said something offensive to

1430
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:40,620
me, you know, even in the case of constructive criticism, because I've seen

1431
01:14:40,620 --> 01:14:44,700
people in WoW when you try to give them feedback on how they're playing and they

1432
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:46,020
go completely off on you.

1433
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:48,460
Don't tell me how to fucking play my character, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

1434
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:51,900
When really the person was just giving really good constructive feedback.

1435
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:56,260
You know, maybe you're having an off day to say, I'm having off night, but there's

1436
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:59,220
people who take constructive criticism the wrong way too.

1437
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:05,340
It's, it's really, you know, what I'm meaning about a really gray area is that

1438
01:15:05,380 --> 01:15:09,420
when you've got so many variables of personality involved with it, you're

1439
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:13,020
running into a problem and you are running into people who are just going to

1440
01:15:13,020 --> 01:15:16,380
be, you know, hypersensitive.

1441
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:20,380
There's people like that in the world, people who do not, who will take offense

1442
01:15:20,380 --> 01:15:24,300
to any little thing and go on a fucking rampage trying to prove that they're

1443
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:29,020
right. If, if you know what I mean, you know, that's why we have so many stupid,

1444
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:32,340
you know, lawsuits go into effect, you know, violent video game laws.

1445
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:37,060
All this is we have a quite a bit of hypersensitivity going on.

1446
01:15:40,180 --> 01:15:45,500
I, I'm really trying to get how, now, I mean, if you've got someone who, yeah,

1447
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:49,100
they've dropped the C-bomb, you know, three different times in one game and

1448
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:52,100
everyone's put out the warning on them, ban them.

1449
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:56,180
If it's with their buddies and their buddies are doing it to warn each of their

1450
01:15:56,180 --> 01:15:59,140
buddies, they get booted from the game for an hour, they get a certain number of

1451
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:00,740
warrants, they're gone forever.

1452
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:03,700
Give them a three strikes.

1453
01:16:05,380 --> 01:16:07,500
The DDR freak system should be applied everywhere.

1454
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:09,140
I think it was wise.

1455
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:12,300
The one thing, the one part you missed, if you were, if you were good, you would

1456
01:16:12,300 --> 01:16:13,660
start to lose points every month.

1457
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:19,700
Right. Yeah. And, but that honestly, I actually did see that starting to really

1458
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:23,380
benefit. And I never, ever got a point ever.

1459
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:28,500
I can fix that now. No, not when they're dead, dead and gone.

1460
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:32,740
Not when they're dead. But, but my, my point is that, you know, if you've got

1461
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:37,700
someone who's having a really shitty day and they go off on someone, yeah, they

1462
01:16:37,700 --> 01:16:39,980
should be held accountable for going off on somebody.

1463
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:44,940
But if they realize, oh, I see this is going to be something that's gonna, you

1464
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:50,860
know, catch up with me later, then definitely give them an opportunity to

1465
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:52,180
amend their behavior.

1466
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:56,780
If they don't amend their behavior, knock them out.

1467
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:59,460
Don't even give, you know, a number of how many warnings you have.

1468
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:00,660
Don't advertise that shit.

1469
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:03,140
Don't advertise that your points will drop off.

1470
01:17:03,740 --> 01:17:08,100
Just say you get a certain amount of warning again, you're dropped.

1471
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:10,100
You know, it is up to us.

1472
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:11,220
We can give you one strike.

1473
01:17:11,220 --> 01:17:12,500
We can give you three strikes.

1474
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:14,300
It depends on what we see.

1475
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:17,580
All right, well, gosh, we get to keep talking about this where we've had a lot

1476
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:18,540
of good discussions tonight.

1477
01:17:18,540 --> 01:17:19,260
What's up with this?

1478
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:23,220
This is supposed to be a slow news week, live.vognetwork.com.

1479
01:17:23,260 --> 01:17:27,500
We could, again, keep this topic going forever, but, uh, we do want to end, you

1480
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:30,220
know, some point tonight instead of tomorrow morning.

1481
01:17:30,220 --> 01:17:32,060
So we're going to keep moving on in the interest of time.

1482
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:33,900
So why don't we, they were right about DancerRx.

1483
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:34,420
Why?

1484
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:34,820
Yeah.

1485
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:36,620
Why don't we go to that next story, Darcyra?

1486
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:38,060
Okay.

1487
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:42,580
Well, if God, if my voice comes back, um, there, I'm sure I've told the story

1488
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:46,820
before about my copy of Descent that I used to have that came on 14 disks.

1489
01:17:47,740 --> 01:17:49,060
And yes, I sat and installed.

1490
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:50,500
That was the way to play.

1491
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:57,660
I have a good friend named Avery who had a chair that he put two controllers on

1492
01:17:57,980 --> 01:17:59,900
and a five, a 10 key pad.

1493
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:02,020
Did he invent mailing labels that go in the printer?

1494
01:18:02,020 --> 01:18:02,540
Shut up.

1495
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,540
And, um, hearts, hearts, hearts.

1496
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:10,260
Um, and he had his, bitch, please.

1497
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:15,980
Now, and, uh, he had, uh, his, uh, Descent chair.

1498
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:17,060
That was the big thing.

1499
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:21,460
Well, the reason why I'm bringing up all this Descent nostalgia is because there's

1500
01:18:21,460 --> 01:18:28,340
a modder going by the name of Max, who is recreating Descent using Unreal Engine 3

1501
01:18:28,340 --> 01:18:29,820
using the Unreal development kit.

1502
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:35,060
And, um, the big thing about this is basically he's going sort of the path of

1503
01:18:35,060 --> 01:18:41,780
Black Mesa, um, where it's called Descent to UDK, where it's not exactly a remake,

1504
01:18:41,780 --> 01:18:46,100
but it's going to bring in the original story with some embellishments.

1505
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:51,460
He's basically trying to diversify the original gameplay and, um, emphasize the,

1506
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:57,300
the scary bits and new weapons, new weapons was good, but man, Descent was the

1507
01:18:57,300 --> 01:19:04,660
first game I played that gave me motion sickness and I sucked at it, but I loved

1508
01:19:04,660 --> 01:19:06,020
it for people our age.

1509
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:08,900
They all remember the first time playing a game like Descent.

1510
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:12,340
It was like, it's doom and 360 degrees.

1511
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:13,700
No, but it's so cool.

1512
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:15,060
It was even more than that.

1513
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:18,980
Instead of having your, you know, little space shooters where you're on rails or,

1514
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:22,820
you know, going through different areas, you had full freedom of movement.

1515
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:23,780
It was amazing.

1516
01:19:24,580 --> 01:19:28,980
Um, I mean, and yeah, there were more games, you know, there was when it went

1517
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:33,460
into Descent three, but going back to the original and bringing in those factors

1518
01:19:33,460 --> 01:19:36,660
that made the original great is I think a good idea.

1519
01:19:36,660 --> 01:19:43,700
There's, uh, Eurogamer actually has a, uh, um, trailer for it up on their website.

1520
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:44,500
It looked pretty good.

1521
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:47,780
I liked the music in Descent too.

1522
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:51,700
All right, let's move on and travel around the world and check out some release

1523
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:54,900
dates and things that are coming through more official channels this week.

1524
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:57,060
Yeah, I think there's something coming out this week.

1525
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:58,420
I'm sure there's a game.

1526
01:19:58,420 --> 01:20:00,340
Um, we'll, we'll get to it though.

1527
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:02,420
Uh, see what we've got this week.

1528
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:04,660
Uh, what's the, what's the big game that's coming out?

1529
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:10,820
Maybe it's a Freaky Forms Deluxe Creations Alive on 3DS.

1530
01:20:10,820 --> 01:20:11,460
Is that it?

1531
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:12,340
No, maybe.

1532
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:16,100
Uh, maybe it's a game for a system that's not out for a couple of weeks.

1533
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:19,300
Mass Effect 3, the special edition for the Wii U.

1534
01:20:21,140 --> 01:20:22,420
Yeah, probably want to wait on that one.

1535
01:20:22,420 --> 01:20:23,460
That's out this week.

1536
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:25,140
How does that work?

1537
01:20:26,980 --> 01:20:27,860
I don't know.

1538
01:20:27,860 --> 01:20:29,860
I think, I think the dates need adjusting.

1539
01:20:29,860 --> 01:20:32,020
I think, I think, you know, they're, what?

1540
01:20:33,460 --> 01:20:36,340
We've got in hand like Scribblenauts already.

1541
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:38,900
Um, not that we can do anything with it.

1542
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:39,220
All right.

1543
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:46,340
Uh, maybe it's Nickelodeon Bubble Guppies on the DS or Nickelodeon Team Umi Zumi and

1544
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:51,860
Dora's Fantastic Flight, both rated EC for those hardcore gamers out there in the DS.

1545
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:56,660
Uh, or maybe Nickelodeon Dance 2 on the Wii and Xbox 360.

1546
01:20:57,620 --> 01:20:58,660
No, no.

1547
01:20:59,540 --> 01:21:04,500
NASCAR, the game Inside Line on PS3, Xbox 360, and Wii.

1548
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:05,140
Maybe?

1549
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:05,380
No.

1550
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:09,460
Mass Effect Trilogy on PC and Xbox 360.

1551
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:12,340
That is absolutely the game, as everybody.

1552
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:13,380
Totally.

1553
01:21:14,420 --> 01:21:18,100
Midway Arcade Origins on PS3 and Xbox 360 this week.

1554
01:21:19,540 --> 01:21:22,500
Also, I bought, I bought that last generation.

1555
01:21:23,140 --> 01:21:28,900
Also, uh, History Legends of War Patton on Xbox 360 and PS3.

1556
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:31,620
Oh, I think that's coming out next year, though.

1557
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:34,660
Uh, Pop Tropica Adventures on the DS.

1558
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:41,700
Dragon Ball Z Budokai HD Collection on PS3 and Xbox 360.

1559
01:21:41,700 --> 01:21:43,700
Ragnarok Tactics on PSP.

1560
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:48,340
Uh, on PSP?

1561
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:49,220
PSP.

1562
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:52,980
Not Vita, PSP.

1563
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:55,780
They just had a Ragnarok game on Vita already.

1564
01:21:55,780 --> 01:21:56,900
It came out last week.

1565
01:21:57,540 --> 01:22:02,500
Um, Saints Row the Third, the full package on PS3 and Xbox 360.

1566
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:06,180
Let's be honest, so this really has the same content that was already on disc for the last game.

1567
01:22:07,780 --> 01:22:08,420
Ba dum bum.

1568
01:22:08,980 --> 01:22:12,500
Well, except for the, except for the three expansions, but all the other DLC was on disc.

1569
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:17,300
Um, Big Time Rush Dance Party on the Wii.

1570
01:22:19,940 --> 01:22:21,700
Rayman Origins on the 3DS.

1571
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:24,980
Pro Evolution Soccer 2013 on the Wii.

1572
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:28,740
Little Big Planet Karting on PS3.

1573
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:33,540
Oh, and that's right, there is a game called Halo 4 that's out on the 360 this week as well.

1574
01:22:34,340 --> 01:22:37,380
And not to be, uh, outdone, Nintendo does have a game coming out.

1575
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:40,180
Paper Mario Sticker Star on the 3DS one week from today.

1576
01:22:41,220 --> 01:22:43,940
Ray Genator just made one of my favorite jokes about NASCAR.

1577
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:46,260
NASCAR has left turned the game.

1578
01:22:49,380 --> 01:22:49,940
Oh boy.

1579
01:22:49,940 --> 01:22:51,140
You really like to go left.

1580
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:52,100
You really like Tide.

1581
01:22:55,060 --> 01:22:58,420
You gonna go to one of those midnight releases and pick up, uh, Little Big Planet Karting?

1582
01:22:59,620 --> 01:23:01,860
I'm not even sure if I'm gonna pick up Little Big Planet Karting.

1583
01:23:01,860 --> 01:23:04,260
I wanna play it, but I haven't played Little Big Planet 2.

1584
01:23:05,860 --> 01:23:06,900
So, probably not.

1585
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:09,620
Although, I do like Karting games.

1586
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:12,180
I'd be a little bit more, you know, motivated to play that, but.

1587
01:23:12,180 --> 01:23:16,340
All I'm gonna say, I know you haven't seen Wreck-It Ralph yet, I'm not gonna spoil it for you,

1588
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:18,900
but they need to make Sugar Rush a real game.

1589
01:23:18,980 --> 01:23:20,340
Yes, they do.

1590
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:23,140
But, because that was fucking outstanding.

1591
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:25,220
I would play the hell out of Sugar Rush.

1592
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:30,580
Wreck-It Ralph is in the new Sonic and Sega All-Stars racing game, Transformed.

1593
01:23:30,580 --> 01:23:32,660
Well, I hope there's a track or something.

1594
01:23:32,660 --> 01:23:33,460
There'd be Vanellope.

1595
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:34,820
Yeah, Vanellope von Schweetz.

1596
01:23:35,460 --> 01:23:40,660
Which, by the way, there's actually a commercial for Sugar Rush.

1597
01:23:40,660 --> 01:23:41,060
Oh yeah?

1598
01:23:41,060 --> 01:23:43,220
That was done as a sort of trailer for Wreck-It Ralph.

1599
01:23:43,220 --> 01:23:43,860
Nice.

1600
01:23:43,860 --> 01:23:48,340
Um, talking about the arcade, they're getting it in four quarters on your birthday.

1601
01:23:48,820 --> 01:23:52,340
I so want to say a quote from the ending, and I can't say it because it's a spoiler,

1602
01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:54,740
but it's one of the, like, you gotta know what I'm talking about.

1603
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:56,980
I was laughing so hard.

1604
01:23:56,980 --> 01:23:58,580
It was the funniest thing in the movie.

1605
01:23:58,580 --> 01:23:59,620
Like, I'll tell you later.

1606
01:24:00,340 --> 01:24:01,140
Off air.

1607
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:02,420
I don't want to spoil it.

1608
01:24:02,420 --> 01:24:05,540
Alright, let's spoil some Japanese release dates.

1609
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:08,580
Did you know that Japan is also getting Halo 4 this week,

1610
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:13,460
and they're getting some new Xbox 360s to come along with it for all those Japanese Halo fans?

1611
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:14,180
There you go.

1612
01:24:14,180 --> 01:24:16,340
Both of you guys can get that this week.

1613
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:19,300
Also coming out this week on the Xbox 360,

1614
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:20,980
Tropico 4 Gold Edition.

1615
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:23,220
I think that's just a price reduction of an existing game.

1616
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:25,460
It's a re-release they're doing.

1617
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:27,780
It's the game with the expansion.

1618
01:24:27,780 --> 01:24:28,660
Alright.

1619
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:32,260
On the PlayStation 3, Silent Hill Downpour, finally,

1620
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:35,620
on the PlayStation 3 in Japan this week.

1621
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:38,500
Shin Sangoku Musou Six Empires.

1622
01:24:38,500 --> 01:24:42,180
Hokuto Musou International getting a price reduction from Koei,

1623
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:47,140
as well as a price reduction for Champion Jockey, G1 Jockey, and Gallop Racer,

1624
01:24:47,140 --> 01:24:50,020
for those of you that like your horsey racing games in Japan.

1625
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:53,220
And the really embarrassing move integration.

1626
01:24:53,220 --> 01:24:54,900
Oh, is that the other big thing?

1627
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:57,700
You're the one that looks like you're playing, was it?

1628
01:24:58,420 --> 01:24:59,220
Final Furlong.

1629
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:00,420
Final Furlong, yeah.

1630
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:01,700
That game was amazing.

1631
01:25:01,700 --> 01:25:02,820
Horse Humping the game.

1632
01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:04,020
Uh, let's see.

1633
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:06,980
Lastly, when do we get Wii U stuff in Japan?

1634
01:25:06,980 --> 01:25:07,380
Oh, that's right.

1635
01:25:07,380 --> 01:25:08,740
They don't get it until December, huh?

1636
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:11,780
I don't start reading those release dates until December.

1637
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:14,500
How about the Nintendo 3DS?

1638
01:25:15,460 --> 01:25:19,620
Another 3DS LL, which is basically their XL pack.

1639
01:25:19,620 --> 01:25:23,700
It's a Dobutsu no Mori pack, limited edition,

1640
01:25:23,700 --> 01:25:29,860
because Tobidase Dobutsu no Mori comes out this week on the Nintendo 3DS.

1641
01:25:29,860 --> 01:25:31,860
And what is Dobutsu no Mori?

1642
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:32,660
Animal Forest.

1643
01:25:32,660 --> 01:25:33,300
That's right.

1644
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:34,820
AKA Animal Crossing.

1645
01:25:34,820 --> 01:25:35,220
That's right.

1646
01:25:35,220 --> 01:25:37,620
Animal Crossing is the big release on the 3DS.

1647
01:25:37,620 --> 01:25:39,300
Technically, that would be Animal's Forest.

1648
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:43,860
Now, um, if Animal Crossing isn't your thing, maybe you're more into Jewel Pet.

1649
01:25:45,860 --> 01:25:51,860
Maho de Osare ni Dance Deco comes out this week as well on the 3DS.

1650
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:56,820
That's fantastic that the, you know, 3DS isn't region-free like the DS was, because,

1651
01:25:56,820 --> 01:26:00,820
you know, people then can't import games that they like to play.

1652
01:26:00,820 --> 01:26:04,420
It would be very hard to play Animal Crossing anyway, because it's all in Japan, Japanese.

1653
01:26:04,420 --> 01:26:09,060
I've freaking tried on my Dobutsu no Mori for GameCube.

1654
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:14,020
And even being, I read so slowly, it takes an hour to do anything.

1655
01:26:14,020 --> 01:26:15,700
But I think what's really cool is that,

1656
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:18,500
I don't know if you guys know this, but the, well, I know I'm sure you do, Jamie,

1657
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:21,380
but when the little characters read when they're talking,

1658
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:25,860
in the Japanese version of the game, they were saying the little Japanese syllables really quick.

1659
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:27,700
So it sounded like they were actually talking.

1660
01:26:27,700 --> 01:26:30,580
But in the English version, you can't really do that same thing.

1661
01:26:30,580 --> 01:26:33,140
So they would say the letters of the alphabet real fast.

1662
01:26:33,140 --> 01:26:33,640
Yeah.

1663
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:34,700
So...

1664
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:37,400
And see, that's why I wanted the Japanese one to play.

1665
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:37,900
Yeah.

1666
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:40,440
Because I thought it would help me with my listening comprehension, no.

1667
01:26:41,480 --> 01:26:43,320
No, it went way too fast.

1668
01:26:44,040 --> 01:26:44,600
Made it worse.

1669
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:45,960
Okay, how about the UK, DarkSakura?

1670
01:26:46,680 --> 01:26:48,600
We have a few selections for the UK.

1671
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:50,360
On November 6th is Halo 4.

1672
01:26:50,920 --> 01:26:54,920
On the 7th is Curiosity for iPhone, PC, Android, and iPad.

1673
01:26:56,520 --> 01:26:59,800
I hope the cube contains eternal joy.

1674
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:03,640
Karateka for Xbox 360.

1675
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:06,040
When is the weekend?

1676
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:07,400
Are you gonna get the cube?

1677
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:08,520
Do you want to know what's in the cube?

1678
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,200
Curiosity, what's in the fucking cube?

1679
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:11,080
What's in the box?

1680
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:12,920
What's in the fucking box?

1681
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:13,720
Tell me what's in the box.

1682
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:15,800
I still have to update my iOS version,

1683
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:20,440
but I would like to pirate it just for the principle of the thing.

1684
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:23,800
On November 8th, we have Angry Birds Star Wars.

1685
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:29,240
On the 9th, a little big cart, little big planet carting.

1686
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:33,000
And Mass Effect trilogy, which I'm gonna make my husband get me.

1687
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:35,640
And that's it.

1688
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:40,920
You do, I hope you did realize that little big planet carting is not coming on the Vita at launch.

1689
01:27:42,520 --> 01:27:46,120
But if I buy it on the PS3, I'll still get my free Vita, right?

1690
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:47,480
Isn't that part of the deal?

1691
01:27:47,480 --> 01:27:49,000
I haven't seen the sticker on the box.

1692
01:27:49,560 --> 01:27:51,800
I know it's on the box for the PlayStation All-Stars stuff,

1693
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:55,080
but at the same time, like, I don't really want that game.

1694
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:56,520
That's not even gonna sell that for me.

1695
01:27:57,240 --> 01:28:00,440
By the way, you know what I totally love about playing Mass Effect on the PC?

1696
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:01,240
What?

1697
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:04,520
Is hacking the coalesced I&I file to get other outfits.

1698
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:06,680
And you wonder why you can't get online in part three.

1699
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:09,400
No, I reinstalled the fucker.

1700
01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:11,480
And it wasn't working.

1701
01:28:11,480 --> 01:28:13,240
So bite my booty.

1702
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:13,880
Reported.

1703
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:19,480
All right, just a couple more news stories for you guys.

1704
01:28:19,480 --> 01:28:23,000
And then the classic game of the week, back when games worked.

1705
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:24,380
Loki.

1706
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:28,220
So yes, there's a patent firm.

1707
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:31,020
And I don't even know why these things exist, but whatever.

1708
01:28:31,660 --> 01:28:37,500
A Texas company has filed a lawsuit against Wizards of the Coast.

1709
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:40,540
Or not against Wizards of the Coast, I guess.

1710
01:28:40,540 --> 01:28:43,340
Hasbro, who has the Magic of the Gathering online game.

1711
01:28:43,340 --> 01:28:45,900
I didn't even realize Hasbro does online games,

1712
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:47,820
but okay, I guess I got in the video game.

1713
01:28:47,820 --> 01:28:50,460
So anyways, so Magic of the Gathering online.

1714
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:54,140
You know, it's been out there for a while now.

1715
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:55,260
Ten years.

1716
01:28:55,260 --> 01:29:00,220
And I guess this Wildcat intellectual property holdings of Dallas.

1717
01:29:00,220 --> 01:29:04,300
They're filing a lawsuit against them to get it taken offline.

1718
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:07,500
I guess they hold the patent for Unit Commander.

1719
01:29:08,060 --> 01:29:11,820
Which calls, I guess, the ultimate mercenary trading card game.

1720
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:14,620
And they're saying that it infringes on that.

1721
01:29:15,740 --> 01:29:22,140
Which something tells me that they probably had the Magic of the Gathering out there

1722
01:29:22,140 --> 01:29:26,300
for a lot longer than they've had the patent for Unit Commander.

1723
01:29:27,660 --> 01:29:32,300
Which, I might add, is about as generic as their patent for said game.

1724
01:29:34,460 --> 01:29:35,100
I don't know.

1725
01:29:35,100 --> 01:29:35,600
We'll see.

1726
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:38,940
We'll see if they even...

1727
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:40,860
I don't think anything's really gonna happen to it.

1728
01:29:40,860 --> 01:29:42,220
I mean, patent troll.

1729
01:29:43,020 --> 01:29:43,820
We can do.

1730
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:47,500
It really does astound me that Magic of the Gathering is still going after all this time.

1731
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:48,700
Pretty strong, you know?

1732
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:51,660
There was just a tournament here locally over the weekend, did you know that?

1733
01:29:52,140 --> 01:29:53,020
I wouldn't doubt it.

1734
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:55,500
They have tournaments playing this like mad.

1735
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:56,940
And I still suck at it.

1736
01:29:58,940 --> 01:30:01,500
Well, it's because they've had all this practice and...

1737
01:30:01,500 --> 01:30:01,980
It's true.

1738
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:03,340
They've been playing for 15 years.

1739
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:05,020
I took a break.

1740
01:30:05,660 --> 01:30:08,140
All right, this is pretty awesome.

1741
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:10,700
A new remake that's been announced for the 3DS.

1742
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:12,060
Dark Soccer, you might be into this too.

1743
01:30:13,020 --> 01:30:16,300
Dragon Quest 7 is being remade for the 3DS.

1744
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:19,660
It's already got a date of February 7th in Japan.

1745
01:30:19,740 --> 01:30:21,820
It's gonna have a new soundtrack and so forth.

1746
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:24,780
So yeah, that's awesome.

1747
01:30:24,780 --> 01:30:27,420
Yeah, Jump Magazine made the confirmation.

1748
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:30,060
February 7th, 6,090 yen.

1749
01:30:30,860 --> 01:30:34,300
There will be street pass and Wi-Fi capabilities added to the game.

1750
01:30:34,300 --> 01:30:35,420
I don't know what that's gonna entail.

1751
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:36,940
That's pretty fucking rad.

1752
01:30:36,940 --> 01:30:41,500
The soundtrack will be performed by the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra.

1753
01:30:42,380 --> 01:30:43,180
That's rad.

1754
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:44,780
Very nice.

1755
01:30:44,780 --> 01:30:46,460
I really hope that comes out over here.

1756
01:30:46,460 --> 01:30:46,960
We'll see.

1757
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:52,240
Dragon Quest 7, if you weren't aware, was originally released on the PlayStation 1.

1758
01:30:52,240 --> 01:30:53,680
That was about 12 years ago.

1759
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:56,320
It was released in the USA, Dragon Warrior 7.

1760
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:56,820
Yes, it was.

1761
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:01,120
Didn't they finally go back to calling it Dragon Quest in the US with 8, though?

1762
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:01,360
Yeah.

1763
01:31:01,360 --> 01:31:02,080
I thought they did.

1764
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:02,960
Oh, and the play...

1765
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:05,440
Man, that's a PS2 game needed to go back and really beat.

1766
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:07,200
Dragon Quest 8 was so good.

1767
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:09,520
The demo for that was like a big thing.

1768
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:15,040
So no word yet if that is coming here, but one can hope.

1769
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:20,080
I bet it'll be one of those things we don't get to next holiday, though.

1770
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:21,200
But that's pretty awesome.

1771
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:23,120
Dragon Quest 7.

1772
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:27,440
Well, what a good lead-in to the Classic Game of the Week.

1773
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:30,240
I don't know if this week's game is 12 years old or older,

1774
01:31:31,440 --> 01:31:35,360
but every week we like to let DarkSakura take a step into the Classic Gaming Vault

1775
01:31:35,360 --> 01:31:37,040
and find a game that she thinks,

1776
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:37,540
hey,

1777
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:39,140
Bratz,

1778
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:41,120
play this game,

1779
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:42,800
and then report me for calling you a brat.

1780
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:45,040
It's the Classic Game of the Week.

1781
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:46,720
DarkSakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?

1782
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:47,360
Bank your ass.

1783
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:49,840
Uh, it's Giga-Wink 2.

1784
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:54,000
And I'm actually specifically referring to the Dreamcast version,

1785
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,720
because today has been my day of Dreamcast love.

1786
01:31:57,520 --> 01:31:59,440
It's always a day of Dreamcast love for you.

1787
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:01,280
This was a fun shooter,

1788
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:03,120
and the cool thing about it is that,

1789
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:05,040
even in the arcade version,

1790
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:09,680
it was actually made for a horizontal monitor instead of being turned vertically.

1791
01:32:10,720 --> 01:32:11,920
You know another game that did that?

1792
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:13,440
Radiant Silver Gun.

1793
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:14,820
How's that?

1794
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:19,620
But anyway, the game was originally developed by Takumi,

1795
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:23,140
and it came out on the NAOMI arcade system,

1796
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:25,380
and then in 2001 it came out on the Dreamcast.

1797
01:32:26,980 --> 01:32:30,340
It basically has like uber huge scores.

1798
01:32:30,340 --> 01:32:32,980
It seriously is like the ego-pumping score system.

1799
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:34,820
You can actually score in the quintillions.

1800
01:32:34,820 --> 01:32:35,460
Did you know that?

1801
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:41,460
On top of that, the good thing about it being a horizontal monitor

1802
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:44,660
is that taking it from arcade to the home version,

1803
01:32:44,740 --> 01:32:48,980
meant that you pretty much still got the arcade treatment.

1804
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:52,100
You didn't have to worry about rotating your TV or anything else,

1805
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:53,860
you know, on edge or any of that,

1806
01:32:54,420 --> 01:32:57,380
which we've actually done some games before.

1807
01:32:57,380 --> 01:32:59,780
In the Dreamcast version, it added a score attack mode,

1808
01:32:59,780 --> 01:33:02,100
a four player mode, gallery mode, online ranking,

1809
01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:09,140
and which actually ended on December 10th, 2003.

1810
01:33:10,180 --> 01:33:14,500
So you had like a ton of different fighters.

1811
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:17,220
A good half of them actually were unlocked.

1812
01:33:17,220 --> 01:33:22,980
You could have Kingfisher, Sparrow, Ravenstork, and Albatross,

1813
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:25,780
and then you could have the Raijin,

1814
01:33:28,340 --> 01:33:31,540
Porchka, Stranger, Carmine, and Wilderstand,

1815
01:33:32,260 --> 01:33:35,060
which were from the first Giggling.

1816
01:33:36,260 --> 01:33:38,980
The soundtrack was super awesome,

1817
01:33:38,980 --> 01:33:41,620
and I even remembered when you could get the soundtrack,

1818
01:33:41,620 --> 01:33:43,300
it came with the soundtrack from Mars Matrix,

1819
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:44,980
which is another game I probably should do,

1820
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:48,180
but the music is all orchestral.

1821
01:33:48,180 --> 01:33:49,220
It should turn up a little bit.

1822
01:33:54,580 --> 01:33:56,180
They had a really crazy soundtrack.

1823
01:33:56,180 --> 01:33:59,620
I mean, really, I mean, in the end, it's a shooter, yeah,

1824
01:34:00,500 --> 01:34:03,620
but it's definitely one that people should check out,

1825
01:34:03,620 --> 01:34:07,380
especially since the Dreamcast is still kind of around and kicking.

1826
01:34:08,340 --> 01:34:08,980
And it's pretty.

1827
01:34:09,620 --> 01:34:11,380
And the other thing about that too,

1828
01:34:11,380 --> 01:34:14,820
is it is basically around the gameplay itself,

1829
01:34:14,820 --> 01:34:18,500
is around the absorption and reflection type mechanics.

1830
01:34:19,540 --> 01:34:22,580
It's huge boss fights, tons of enemies.

1831
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:25,540
It's, I wouldn't quite say it's a bullet hell

1832
01:34:25,540 --> 01:34:27,060
as much as it is an enemy hell,

1833
01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:31,060
but I love the level scrolling in the design.

1834
01:34:31,060 --> 01:34:33,620
It's like it adds another layer of depth,

1835
01:34:33,620 --> 01:34:37,780
even if it is a top-down type shooter.

1836
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:40,740
So definitely worth playing.

1837
01:34:41,700 --> 01:34:42,340
All righty.

1838
01:34:42,340 --> 01:34:44,420
Some Dreamcast love from dark soccer this week

1839
01:34:44,420 --> 01:34:45,540
in the classic game of the week.

1840
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:48,900
It is Giga Wing 2, or the Dreamcast.

1841
01:34:50,420 --> 01:34:51,220
Very nice pick.

1842
01:34:52,740 --> 01:34:53,460
Let's see.

1843
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:55,220
Yyr in the chat room says,

1844
01:34:55,220 --> 01:34:57,380
Giga Wing 2 is also the only shmup I know of

1845
01:34:57,380 --> 01:34:59,220
that supports four simultaneous players.

1846
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:00,340
Exactly.

1847
01:35:01,300 --> 01:35:01,780
All right.

1848
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:04,740
Well, that is going to do it for part A of our show,

1849
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:05,460
but don't go anywhere.

1850
01:35:05,460 --> 01:35:07,940
There is plenty more Orange Launch Radio to come tonight,

1851
01:35:07,940 --> 01:35:09,860
including the Fugu question of the week.

1852
01:35:09,860 --> 01:35:12,420
Some details on the Wii U's browser.

1853
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:13,620
It's going to be very interesting,

1854
01:35:13,620 --> 01:35:15,620
as well as some other Nintendo details.

1855
01:35:15,620 --> 01:35:18,820
And Mega Man Wily Wars.

1856
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:20,340
If you don't know about this game,

1857
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:21,620
may have fallen off your radar.

1858
01:35:21,620 --> 01:35:22,340
It's not a new game.

1859
01:35:22,340 --> 01:35:23,460
It's a game for many, many years ago.

1860
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:24,740
It was for the Genesis.

1861
01:35:24,740 --> 01:35:28,420
It never came out in the US until now.

1862
01:35:28,420 --> 01:35:30,500
So we'll be talking about that after the break.

1863
01:35:36,660 --> 01:35:39,780
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

1864
01:35:39,780 --> 01:35:41,300
Live at the Voice of Geeks Network,

1865
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:45,700
vaughnetwork.com with the 480th episode of our show.

1866
01:35:47,060 --> 01:35:49,220
Possibly a different time for some of you tonight,

1867
01:35:49,220 --> 01:35:51,300
because there was that whole daylight savings

1868
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:52,820
that happened over the weekend.

1869
01:35:52,820 --> 01:35:55,460
And you know what they say, spring forward, fall back.

1870
01:35:55,460 --> 01:35:57,860
So everybody got an extra hour sleep last night.

1871
01:35:57,860 --> 01:35:58,420
Woo hoo.

1872
01:35:58,420 --> 01:35:59,220
I needed it.

1873
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:02,020
Or if you were me, you got home at four in the morning

1874
01:36:02,020 --> 01:36:03,300
instead of five in the morning.

1875
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:05,780
That was my lucky thing,

1876
01:36:05,780 --> 01:36:08,020
but that's what I get for going to the Bay Area

1877
01:36:08,020 --> 01:36:10,260
and staying out late and then driving home the same night.

1878
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:10,980
Why?

1879
01:36:10,980 --> 01:36:14,740
Because I had Starbucks and I wasn't feeling tired.

1880
01:36:15,460 --> 01:36:18,260
Hooray, by the way, for Peppermint Mocha's

1881
01:36:18,260 --> 01:36:19,380
being back at Starbucks.

1882
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:21,380
I guess technically you can get those any time of the year.

1883
01:36:21,380 --> 01:36:22,740
You can also get them sugar free.

1884
01:36:22,740 --> 01:36:24,740
But yeah, they have the skinny ones now, which is great.

1885
01:36:24,740 --> 01:36:26,180
But you know what they don't have yet

1886
01:36:26,180 --> 01:36:27,940
is the gingerbread lattes.

1887
01:36:27,940 --> 01:36:29,940
And those are amazing.

1888
01:36:29,940 --> 01:36:31,860
Anyway, it's not a coffee cast.

1889
01:36:31,860 --> 01:36:32,980
It's a video game cast.

1890
01:36:32,980 --> 01:36:35,620
It's just coffee is sometimes how we get through the day.

1891
01:36:36,500 --> 01:36:38,020
We will get back to video games.

1892
01:36:38,020 --> 01:36:40,020
Rob, coffee is how I get through my life.

1893
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:43,380
I do want to mention the elections are this week.

1894
01:36:43,380 --> 01:36:44,100
You might have heard.

1895
01:36:44,100 --> 01:36:47,460
So of course, if you live in the US or, you know,

1896
01:36:47,460 --> 01:36:49,940
a country that lets you vote, you probably should vote.

1897
01:36:50,660 --> 01:36:52,580
It is your right after all.

1898
01:36:52,580 --> 01:36:55,060
And remember, you do not get to bitch about the results

1899
01:36:55,060 --> 01:36:56,580
if you do not vote.

1900
01:36:56,580 --> 01:36:59,700
And I, for one, can't wait for those freaking election calls

1901
01:36:59,700 --> 01:37:02,100
to stop calling me on my phone every 10 minutes.

1902
01:37:02,100 --> 01:37:04,900
I did, however, get to call Dan Lundgren.

1903
01:37:05,620 --> 01:37:07,300
A dick where he would hear it.

1904
01:37:08,340 --> 01:37:08,980
Good times.

1905
01:37:08,980 --> 01:37:10,420
Of course, it was an accident.

1906
01:37:10,420 --> 01:37:12,100
It just cracked me up that you and I

1907
01:37:12,100 --> 01:37:14,660
got the exact same phone call at the exact same time

1908
01:37:14,660 --> 01:37:15,860
while we were sitting here in the studio.

1909
01:37:15,860 --> 01:37:16,660
It's like, really?

1910
01:37:16,660 --> 01:37:17,160
Really?

1911
01:37:17,700 --> 01:37:20,740
Anyhow, let's get it back into video games

1912
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:22,260
and some rapid fire news.

1913
01:37:22,260 --> 01:37:22,760
Loki.

1914
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:23,800
All right.

1915
01:37:24,580 --> 01:37:26,100
So first thing, we're going to talk a little bit

1916
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:29,540
about a new addition for a smart glass member.

1917
01:37:29,540 --> 01:37:32,020
We knew that Forza Horizon was going to use smart glass,

1918
01:37:32,020 --> 01:37:33,220
but it kind of wasn't.

1919
01:37:33,220 --> 01:37:34,900
So now it is.

1920
01:37:34,980 --> 01:37:37,140
And so they've got some really cool stuff with that,

1921
01:37:37,140 --> 01:37:40,180
including an in-game map that you can use,

1922
01:37:41,700 --> 01:37:42,740
which is kind of cool.

1923
01:37:42,740 --> 01:37:45,620
And I guess it allows you to do all the same stuff

1924
01:37:45,620 --> 01:37:47,060
that you can do by pausing the game,

1925
01:37:47,060 --> 01:37:48,660
but now without pausing the game.

1926
01:37:48,660 --> 01:37:51,380
And you can set destination GPSes and all that stuff.

1927
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:54,340
Might be kind of cool.

1928
01:37:54,340 --> 01:37:55,700
I'd have to check that out, I guess.

1929
01:37:56,260 --> 01:37:58,340
Because Forza looks like it might be fun.

1930
01:37:58,340 --> 01:37:59,940
Have to ask Bobby if he's tried it yet.

1931
01:38:00,740 --> 01:38:02,660
He did a review at vognetwork.com.

1932
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:03,860
He would tell you to go read.

1933
01:38:03,860 --> 01:38:04,580
Well, I understand that.

1934
01:38:04,580 --> 01:38:05,940
But I meant about the smart glass thing.

1935
01:38:05,940 --> 01:38:06,900
Oh, the smart glass.

1936
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:08,180
Oh, I don't know about that.

1937
01:38:08,180 --> 01:38:08,680
Yeah.

1938
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:11,620
He's busy with the football stuff.

1939
01:38:11,620 --> 01:38:14,340
So I played the demo for Forza.

1940
01:38:14,340 --> 01:38:15,460
I didn't do the smart glass thing,

1941
01:38:15,460 --> 01:38:16,660
because I don't think that's in the demo.

1942
01:38:16,660 --> 01:38:18,500
But I like the demo.

1943
01:38:18,500 --> 01:38:20,580
I might pick up the game.

1944
01:38:20,580 --> 01:38:20,980
I don't know.

1945
01:38:20,980 --> 01:38:23,300
It's kind of like there's just so much right now that.

1946
01:38:23,300 --> 01:38:24,740
I have that racing wheel, man.

1947
01:38:24,740 --> 01:38:27,540
It's been collecting dust that I kind of need to use that.

1948
01:38:27,540 --> 01:38:30,100
So I may have to pick it up to try that.

1949
01:38:31,460 --> 01:38:31,960
Excellent.

1950
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:35,880
Um, also something that's kind of cool, that shoot mania storm.

1951
01:38:35,880 --> 01:38:37,800
I was kind of a fan of track mania.

1952
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:41,080
And so now they're getting into the other type of games.

1953
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:45,800
Shoot mania being their kind of first person shooter arena battle game.

1954
01:38:45,800 --> 01:38:50,600
Although, I mean, one of the things about the whole mania series is that you can customize

1955
01:38:50,600 --> 01:38:53,560
everything, including the game types and all that and share those.

1956
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:59,960
So it is going to be, I guess, coming soon in a beta form.

1957
01:39:00,520 --> 01:39:03,080
And that'll be out in December.

1958
01:39:03,080 --> 01:39:09,400
And then the game is expected to arrive on January 23rd, which is going to be kind of cool.

1959
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:13,160
And I guess the beta is going to also have like a welcome build.

1960
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:15,560
They're going to have a couple new game modes and stuff.

1961
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:19,320
Like one they mentioned is laser jump and wall jump and grappling hook.

1962
01:39:20,840 --> 01:39:22,600
I can't help but think about looking at this stuff.

1963
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:25,480
It'd be kind of cool like a 3D laser tag game.

1964
01:39:25,480 --> 01:39:26,840
That might be pretty awesome, but.

1965
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:29,000
Oh, you and laser tag.

1966
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,120
Fucking love laser tag.

1967
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:31,800
When was the last time you went to like a Qsar?

1968
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:32,680
It's been a while.

1969
01:39:32,680 --> 01:39:33,480
Oh, that's too bad.

1970
01:39:33,480 --> 01:39:34,680
I miss the Qsars.

1971
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:38,280
They still have that one in Vacaville, which is like the closest one sadly.

1972
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,240
Yeah, I think they do, but it's just kind of.

1973
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:43,720
It's a sad shadow of its former self.

1974
01:39:43,720 --> 01:39:44,520
Exactly.

1975
01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:49,080
I mean, in the next closest ones in Concord or Pleasanton.

1976
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:51,100
I don't know.

1977
01:39:52,280 --> 01:39:54,440
Well, if I can drive to Milpitas, go to the Great Mall.

1978
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:56,280
Well, I mean.

1979
01:39:56,280 --> 01:39:57,240
And get shoes.

1980
01:39:57,400 --> 01:40:00,360
It's not a matter of driving there because it's only like 45 minutes away, but

1981
01:40:00,920 --> 01:40:02,520
it's just not worth it.

1982
01:40:02,520 --> 01:40:04,840
It's just very, very much in disrepair.

1983
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:08,440
And it's Vacaville and like kind of a hick town.

1984
01:40:08,440 --> 01:40:09,160
Vacaville.

1985
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:10,440
Yeah.

1986
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:13,160
Let's say you're playing with a bunch of redneck guys.

1987
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:14,600
And then you can go to the nut tree.

1988
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:17,320
Moving on.

1989
01:40:17,320 --> 01:40:17,960
Sorry.

1990
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:19,560
I didn't mean to localize the show.

1991
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:20,060
Sorry.

1992
01:40:21,320 --> 01:40:24,360
And in Portals, getting some DLC that they've hinted at a while back.

1993
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,160
It was a whole DLC that was kind of part of the.

1994
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:36,360
Was it the motion controller shit that they had on PC, but it never kind of took off.

1995
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:41,080
But now they have this whole move based motion stuff that they're kind of porting over from

1996
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:41,400
that.

1997
01:40:41,400 --> 01:40:43,800
So it's the in motion DLC.

1998
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:47,960
It's going to come on November 6 for 10 bucks.

1999
01:40:47,960 --> 01:40:51,160
And also, I guess the full game is also going to get move support as well.

2000
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:52,600
They're going to patch that in.

2001
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:58,920
And it was six cents was the company that made the original stuff.

2002
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:02,200
It's 20 new test chambers that you can play.

2003
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:04,760
And I guess they have new cubes that you can adjust the size of.

2004
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:09,240
And you can also move portals around stuff and rotate objects using the move controller.

2005
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:10,840
That might be fun.

2006
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:11,640
I have portal too.

2007
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:13,800
And I do have a move that I'm not using.

2008
01:41:13,800 --> 01:41:16,120
So maybe.

2009
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:16,620
Maybe.

2010
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:18,760
All right.

2011
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:19,960
Moving on to some other news.

2012
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:23,240
We've been talking a little bit about the Mass Effect trilogy.

2013
01:41:23,240 --> 01:41:25,320
It is also coming to the PlayStation 3.

2014
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:27,080
But you'll have to wait a little longer.

2015
01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:30,760
December 4 is the date that was announced for Mass Effect trilogy on the PlayStation

2016
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:31,000
3.

2017
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,440
That's December 7 in Europe.

2018
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:35,080
So at least it'll make it before Christmas.

2019
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:36,760
But it is going to be about a month behind.

2020
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:41,720
But I mean, a lot of people are waiting for the PlayStation debut of the original Mass

2021
01:41:41,720 --> 01:41:43,480
Effect, which, of course, will be in the trilogy.

2022
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:47,480
Or you'll also be able to get it on the PlayStation Network.

2023
01:41:47,480 --> 01:41:49,080
It's going to set you back 15 bucks.

2024
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:51,320
There's also excuse me.

2025
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:54,680
Oh, sneezing radio guy's worst enemy.

2026
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:59,320
There's also some detail on the DLC that's going to be included with the trilogy.

2027
01:41:59,960 --> 01:42:04,200
All the Cerberus Network with Mass Effect 2, of course, on the PlayStation 3, though,

2028
01:42:04,200 --> 01:42:08,920
you're going to get Lair of the Shadow Broker, Kasumi, which is like what you need most of

2029
01:42:08,920 --> 01:42:11,240
all, and Overlord.

2030
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:12,600
You get do you get Zaid?

2031
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:14,600
It doesn't say Zaid and it doesn't say Arrival.

2032
01:42:15,320 --> 01:42:16,760
So you don't get all of the place.

2033
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:19,480
Arrival was really necessary to the story.

2034
01:42:20,120 --> 01:42:22,680
Well, they can get another 10 bucks out of you, though.

2035
01:42:22,680 --> 01:42:25,720
Mass Effect 3 will have Cerberus Network, but not Leviathan.

2036
01:42:26,360 --> 01:42:29,080
But I'm assuming it will have the multiplayer and all that good stuff.

2037
01:42:29,080 --> 01:42:32,040
So that's that's one of the best features that keeps it going.

2038
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:32,680
So there you go.

2039
01:42:33,240 --> 01:42:35,000
December 4th on the PlayStation 3.

2040
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:42,360
And I kind of want it just because I have I have the entire trilogy on 360, the entire

2041
01:42:42,360 --> 01:42:43,240
trilogy on PC.

2042
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:48,200
I think I kind of owe it to myself to get the entire trilogy on PlayStation as well.

2043
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:49,240
Don't you agree, Loki?

2044
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:50,520
Don't you get my logic?

2045
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:51,640
Don't you understand me?

2046
01:42:51,640 --> 01:42:52,140
Nope.

2047
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:57,400
There's a Wreck-It Ralph IOS game.

2048
01:42:57,400 --> 01:43:00,520
If you were a fan of the movie, maybe you'll be a fan of the IOS game.

2049
01:43:00,520 --> 01:43:05,080
It includes Fix-It Felix Junior, which is the game that the movie's about.

2050
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:09,000
I do want to point out, though, Fix-It Felix Junior is also a standalone app for free.

2051
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:13,960
This other app is 99 cents, and you can also get Sweet Climber.

2052
01:43:13,960 --> 01:43:17,400
It has it's just inspired by Sugar Rush, but it's not a racing game.

2053
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:20,360
It's a bounce up the thing.

2054
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:24,680
It references the scene in the movie, but you tilt the controller or your controller.

2055
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:29,080
You tilt your iPhone back and forth or iPad or whatever to move him left and right.

2056
01:43:29,080 --> 01:43:35,160
And then Hero's Duty is like a twin stick shooter, which was kind of neat, I guess,

2057
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:39,560
except the fact that there's no tangible joystick on the iPad, which is stupid.

2058
01:43:39,560 --> 01:43:40,060
Unless.

2059
01:43:41,720 --> 01:43:44,680
I don't know if it has IK support because it's a twin stick shooter.

2060
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:49,160
There's also, I'll tell you, I downloaded it because it's only 99 cents.

2061
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:49,560
What the hell?

2062
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:50,280
And I love the movie.

2063
01:43:50,920 --> 01:43:56,040
There is also apparently Turbo Time is a game that's coming, but it's locked right now.

2064
01:43:56,040 --> 01:43:57,080
It says coming soon.

2065
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:59,960
So there will be, it looks like a fourth game added into it.

2066
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:01,160
So pretty cool.

2067
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:03,800
If you're a fan of Wreck-It Ralph, the IOS game's out there right now.

2068
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:10,520
There was a wedding in gaming this week, and this is a pretty good one for the gaming industry.

2069
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:15,400
John Romero and Brenda Brathwaite actually got married.

2070
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:18,680
This is actually last weekend, but just the news came out this week.

2071
01:44:19,480 --> 01:44:25,480
Get this, between the two of them, Doom, Wizardry, Quake, Commander Keen,

2072
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:27,720
Jagged Alliance, Wolfenstein 3D.

2073
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:32,360
Maybe this is why, wasn't she one of the two people behind that

2074
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:35,640
Kickstarter for like the old school RPG or something like that?

2075
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:37,880
I can't remember.

2076
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:39,560
I think she was, and maybe that's why.

2077
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:42,520
Her name came up on the show recently.

2078
01:44:42,520 --> 01:44:46,600
Yeah, maybe that's why they closed down the whole Kickstarter for that.

2079
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:51,880
Well, they also established a social game studio together in 2010.

2080
01:44:51,880 --> 01:44:54,840
Loot Drop was the studio that they co-founded together.

2081
01:44:55,720 --> 01:45:01,400
They were married by id Software co-founder Tom Hall, which is pretty cute.

2082
01:45:02,280 --> 01:45:04,840
And get this, Star Soccer, guess where they were married?

2083
01:45:06,280 --> 01:45:07,720
Disneyland on the Steamboat.

2084
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:15,800
Oh, and then for their honeymoon, they went to hell and killed demons.

2085
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:16,280
Just kidding.

2086
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:17,000
And it was fun.

2087
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:17,640
And it was fun.

2088
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:19,800
All right, let's move on.

2089
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:21,240
Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

2090
01:45:21,240 --> 01:45:24,040
Some stuff, things.

2091
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:26,680
How about some Ragnarok stuff?

2092
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:30,280
The developer for Ragnarok is working and that's,

2093
01:45:30,280 --> 01:45:32,680
God, I hate when my screen messes up like this.

2094
01:45:32,680 --> 01:45:39,080
That's Kazuki Morishita, I believe, is working on a Nintendo 3DS title.

2095
01:45:39,640 --> 01:45:43,400
They're not saying what it's going to be, but he works in Ragnarok.

2096
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:45,880
So hey, maybe it's more Ragnarok.

2097
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:53,960
Then in more news, Treasure is working on a Nintendo 3DS exclusive.

2098
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:59,080
So you know if Treasure's behind it, it's going to be fucking weird and pretty good.

2099
01:46:00,120 --> 01:46:00,600
Weird and good.

2100
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:01,400
I mean, they did Gunstar Jokes.

2101
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:02,680
Fucking weird, but pretty good.

2102
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:03,320
Yeah.

2103
01:46:03,320 --> 01:46:05,720
I don't think Treasure's ever put out any crap.

2104
01:46:05,720 --> 01:46:06,220
So.

2105
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:20,040
And then, Cypress Hill's shag loses $250 million at the Grand Theft Auto lawsuit.

2106
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:28,680
Basically, he said that his likeness and life story was used to create the character CJ

2107
01:46:29,320 --> 01:46:31,000
in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

2108
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:34,120
And the judge said no.

2109
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:36,280
Sorry, you lose.

2110
01:46:36,280 --> 01:46:38,920
Do not pass go lose $250 million.

2111
01:46:38,920 --> 01:46:41,320
I don't think he lost $250 million.

2112
01:46:41,320 --> 01:46:42,200
He lost the ability to win.

2113
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:44,360
He didn't win $250 million.

2114
01:46:44,360 --> 01:46:47,080
But you can't lose what you didn't get.

2115
01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:48,200
$250 million.

2116
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:50,120
Well, that and he had to pay for his court costs.

2117
01:46:50,120 --> 01:46:51,240
So he's probably out something.

2118
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:52,440
He's out something.

2119
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:52,940
Yep.

2120
01:46:53,320 --> 01:46:54,120
And you know what I say?

2121
01:46:55,720 --> 01:46:58,360
That whole lawsuit was insane in the membrane.

2122
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:00,440
Womp womp.

2123
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:02,200
Okay, that's it.

2124
01:47:02,200 --> 01:47:02,680
Oh, that's it.

2125
01:47:02,680 --> 01:47:03,240
All right.

2126
01:47:03,240 --> 01:47:05,640
Let's go to the FUGL question of the week.

2127
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:18,600
Take the words Facebook and Google as in plus and slam them together and you get FUGL.

2128
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:19,960
And that's where the statement comes from.

2129
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:24,280
It's where we ask our fan community is a question and get their answers.

2130
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:28,280
And of course, as everybody's talking about the movies, we had to make the FUGL question

2131
01:47:28,280 --> 01:47:29,480
about Wreck-It Ralph.

2132
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:33,560
If the box office numbers are any indication, it looks like many of you saw Wreck-It Ralph

2133
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:34,120
this weekend.

2134
01:47:34,120 --> 01:47:35,320
What'd you think of the movie?

2135
01:47:35,320 --> 01:47:38,520
Was it a great thing for video games or were you not happy at the way things were done?

2136
01:47:39,240 --> 01:47:41,960
Act Def starts us off on Google Plus saying, I loved it.

2137
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:43,400
Everything about it was great.

2138
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:45,480
The story, the cameos, the jokes, everything.

2139
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:47,320
Anyone who hasn't seen this movie should do so.

2140
01:47:47,320 --> 01:47:47,800
It's great.

2141
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:50,120
It truly surpasses the Disney standards.

2142
01:47:50,120 --> 01:47:51,960
Was it a great thing for video games?

2143
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:56,120
That I really do not know since the movie only has references to games and such, but

2144
01:47:56,120 --> 01:48:00,200
it isn't a real video game movie like Silent Hill, for example.

2145
01:48:00,200 --> 01:48:03,000
It's just a story set in a video game universe.

2146
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:06,680
But maybe it'll get people interested in retro gaming since most of the references are really

2147
01:48:06,680 --> 01:48:07,960
from the old days of gaming.

2148
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:13,240
Elliot B. answers the question on Google and says, I was really excited about seeing it.

2149
01:48:13,240 --> 01:48:14,680
The trailer looked great.

2150
01:48:14,680 --> 01:48:18,760
Then I realized it's not out until February here in the UK.

2151
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:21,480
Here's something I want to just pose a question.

2152
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:24,520
Do you think there are kids growing up nowadays that don't know what an arcade is?

2153
01:48:26,360 --> 01:48:30,360
You know, one thing I will fault the movie for is that it was a little, you did have

2154
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:34,360
to suspend disbelief that people were lining up at the arcade to get in when they'd open

2155
01:48:34,360 --> 01:48:39,480
it in the morning and that it was as full as it looked because you and I, and she all

2156
01:48:39,480 --> 01:48:41,320
know that arcades don't look like that anymore.

2157
01:48:41,320 --> 01:48:43,400
Unfortunately, there's a water park attached.

2158
01:48:43,400 --> 01:48:43,720
Yeah.

2159
01:48:43,720 --> 01:48:44,520
Right.

2160
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:49,880
So, um, that you did have to suspend disbelief for a little bit, but are there kids growing

2161
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:51,560
up today that don't know what an arcade is?

2162
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:55,400
Um, no, because kids still have birthday parties at Chuck E Cheese and Dave and Bust, well,

2163
01:48:55,400 --> 01:48:59,960
or whatever, all those types of places, bounce houses have arcades in them.

2164
01:48:59,960 --> 01:49:01,880
Here's the, it's all ticket redemption.

2165
01:49:01,880 --> 01:49:06,760
You have a few arcade games in there, but most of it's ticket redemption.

2166
01:49:06,760 --> 01:49:08,120
Disneyland still has arcades.

2167
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:14,680
You know, there's arcades around, but it's just a lot of them tend to be the dollar experiences

2168
01:49:14,680 --> 01:49:21,160
and, you know, they're driving games or, you know, gun games or whatever.

2169
01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:24,680
Just very few of the fix it, Felix Jr.

2170
01:49:24,680 --> 01:49:28,680
Type of games, which clearly was inspired by Donkey Kong and that type of stuff that,

2171
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:34,200
that type of experience doesn't really exist anymore, except maybe in the corner to get

2172
01:49:34,200 --> 01:49:35,640
little use out of those old games.

2173
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:38,760
So Elliot wants to snow.

2174
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:40,840
He went and saw Skyfall instead.

2175
01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:44,680
Now see, Skyfall is now here until this week and I really want to see it.

2176
01:49:46,040 --> 01:49:47,720
Dan's been pissing himself over.

2177
01:49:47,720 --> 01:49:51,720
I actually really like James Bond movies, so I'm kind of excited about Skyfall.

2178
01:49:51,720 --> 01:49:54,040
Craig is pretty, he's a great Bond.

2179
01:49:54,040 --> 01:49:54,680
He's great.

2180
01:49:54,680 --> 01:49:55,560
I love his eyes.

2181
01:49:56,360 --> 01:49:58,120
He'll be even better as Indiana Jones.

2182
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:02,200
Next up, E3VL.

2183
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:04,840
I guess that's evil on Google Plus.

2184
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:08,920
Loved the video game nostalgia, especially those happening in the background and emotional

2185
01:50:08,920 --> 01:50:09,720
spikes.

2186
01:50:09,720 --> 01:50:12,360
This film was like the Roger Rabbit of video games.

2187
01:50:12,360 --> 01:50:16,920
Seems like the movie panders way too much to the old gen gamers, 20 plus years old with

2188
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:18,360
the video game references.

2189
01:50:18,360 --> 01:50:22,840
Younger audiences may feel bored if it weren't for the Sugar Rush game and level puns.

2190
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:26,760
If you bring your kids, prepare for them to be confused and saddened in certain segments

2191
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:30,280
and jump for joy after wiped tears as its problems are resolved.

2192
01:50:30,920 --> 01:50:35,160
Again, without spoiling too much though, the Sugar Rush thing kind of made up the majority

2193
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:37,160
of the movie.

2194
01:50:37,160 --> 01:50:40,600
So I don't think kids, I don't think the references will be, I mean there's a lot of

2195
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:42,680
references are going to go over the kids heads.

2196
01:50:42,680 --> 01:50:47,400
Like in the, in the, the baddie video game club, which is in the trailer, I'm not spoiling

2197
01:50:47,400 --> 01:50:47,880
anything.

2198
01:50:47,880 --> 01:50:51,480
The little like League of Villains baddie recovery group.

2199
01:50:51,480 --> 01:50:54,440
Like kids will just get that they're villains.

2200
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:55,800
They'll get Zangief.

2201
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:56,840
They'll get Bison.

2202
01:50:56,840 --> 01:50:59,640
Maybe, but they're not, the kids may not understand.

2203
01:50:59,640 --> 01:51:01,400
I think they'll get Pac-Man as well.

2204
01:51:01,400 --> 01:51:07,720
Why did, why did, why, you know, like there's a very obvious reference to Kano from Mortal

2205
01:51:07,720 --> 01:51:08,200
Kombat.

2206
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:09,080
That is Kano.

2207
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:09,480
Yeah, I know.

2208
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:11,080
A very, very obvious reference.

2209
01:51:11,080 --> 01:51:12,600
And I don't think kids are going to get it.

2210
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:14,280
The zombies from House of the Dead.

2211
01:51:14,280 --> 01:51:15,720
Yeah, but adults get it.

2212
01:51:15,720 --> 01:51:17,560
And you know who the purple rhino was?

2213
01:51:18,120 --> 01:51:19,240
The embossed monster beast.

2214
01:51:20,040 --> 01:51:21,720
With the fancy unicorns.

2215
01:51:21,720 --> 01:51:23,240
Yeah, with fancy unicorns.

2216
01:51:23,240 --> 01:51:29,000
But I mean, but I mean, for example, Becky's kid, he played Pac-Man.

2217
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:32,040
He knows Pac-Man because they had a little retro arcade thing.

2218
01:51:32,040 --> 01:51:33,960
I mean, they have Pac-Man and Dave and Busters now.

2219
01:51:33,960 --> 01:51:36,200
It's the, but it's Pac-Man Battle Royale, that whole thing.

2220
01:51:36,200 --> 01:51:39,640
But I mean, there's, well, there's Pac-Man's in everything.

2221
01:51:39,720 --> 01:51:41,880
It's sort of like ingrained into society now.

2222
01:51:42,440 --> 01:51:44,920
All right, let's go to Facebook because we had some good answers on Facebook.

2223
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:48,760
Tiger Claw says, I think Wreck-It Ralph is hands down the best video game movie ever

2224
01:51:48,760 --> 01:51:49,400
made.

2225
01:51:49,400 --> 01:51:53,880
Given how well it's doing at the box office, I would hope Disney do a sequel or maybe turn

2226
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:58,360
it into an animated series a la Captain N. The film does a great job at establishing

2227
01:51:58,360 --> 01:52:02,920
the universe so I could totally see more stories being told inside the video game world and

2228
01:52:02,920 --> 01:52:05,560
show more of the video games that live inside it.

2229
01:52:05,560 --> 01:52:07,400
I agree and I don't agree with you.

2230
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:13,400
I think there's the potential to do other movies in this universe that's been established,

2231
01:52:13,400 --> 01:52:16,280
but I kind of draw the line at the Captain N thing.

2232
01:52:16,280 --> 01:52:20,920
Remember, Mario's not in this movie because if Mario had been in the movie, it would have

2233
01:52:20,920 --> 01:52:22,040
been about Mario.

2234
01:52:22,040 --> 01:52:25,320
And the movie's not about the existing video game characters.

2235
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:29,560
They just, all the existing video game characters play supporting roles and that's what's

2236
01:52:29,560 --> 01:52:30,280
really cool about it.

2237
01:52:30,280 --> 01:52:32,680
But Nintendo, a Captain N video game would be pretty awesome.

2238
01:52:33,560 --> 01:52:35,560
Captain N was absolute shit.

2239
01:52:36,120 --> 01:52:39,240
Well, they can fix all the wrongs, you know, the 80s weird stuff.

2240
01:52:39,240 --> 01:52:43,320
I mean, like Simon Belmont being all weird and stuff, but if they fix all that, it could

2241
01:52:43,320 --> 01:52:44,280
be pretty cool.

2242
01:52:44,280 --> 01:52:47,400
Xenocore in our chat room agrees with you, by the way, live.vognetwork.com.

2243
01:52:47,400 --> 01:52:49,240
He says, Captain N, the hell you say?

2244
01:52:49,240 --> 01:52:50,920
We can do better than Captain N.

2245
01:52:50,920 --> 01:52:51,640
Mega high.

2246
01:52:53,080 --> 01:52:58,840
Osfer says, honestly, I think Wreck-It Ralph did do well due to it being a Pixar film.

2247
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:00,440
I got fooled, buddy.

2248
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:01,320
He got fooled.

2249
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:02,760
It looks like a Pixar film.

2250
01:53:02,760 --> 01:53:04,440
It was, look at the opening.

2251
01:53:04,440 --> 01:53:06,200
It's the Disney classic studio.

2252
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:09,960
But it did have the Pixar logo right at the stop.

2253
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:12,840
Because it was produced by Lasseter.

2254
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:17,160
It was produced by one of the Pixar guys, although technically it's in the same, this

2255
01:53:17,160 --> 01:53:22,840
is the same studio that did Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and more recently

2256
01:53:22,840 --> 01:53:25,720
Tangled, which is a very similar film, also not Pixar.

2257
01:53:25,720 --> 01:53:27,320
So it was produced by Lasseter.

2258
01:53:27,320 --> 01:53:27,800
Right.

2259
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:32,920
So, I mean, it's just, you know, this is where Disney having bought Pixar, this is where

2260
01:53:32,920 --> 01:53:35,400
you're really starting to see the fruits of them coming together.

2261
01:53:35,400 --> 01:53:40,280
But Brave was the Pixar film from this year and Monsters, you or whatever, is their big

2262
01:53:40,280 --> 01:53:41,080
movie next year.

2263
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:47,320
And I think the next Disney movie, the Disney classic movie next year is The Frozen.

2264
01:53:47,320 --> 01:53:47,640
Yeah.

2265
01:53:47,640 --> 01:53:48,200
Right.

2266
01:53:48,200 --> 01:53:49,480
So, all right.

2267
01:53:49,480 --> 01:53:51,480
Anyhow, continuing on with Osfer's comment.

2268
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:53,560
I didn't mean to, like, I'm not like calling you out or anything.

2269
01:53:53,560 --> 01:53:56,360
I'm just saying you made a mistake a lot of people are making.

2270
01:53:56,440 --> 01:53:58,760
And Pixar movies are great.

2271
01:53:58,760 --> 01:54:00,200
Maybe that was intentional.

2272
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:05,560
You know, there really is not a bad Pixar movie unless it was a sequel to a mediocre

2273
01:54:05,560 --> 01:54:06,200
one.

2274
01:54:06,200 --> 01:54:06,520
All right.

2275
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:11,080
Those are usually the most hyped up films and it's rare to turn on the TV without seeing

2276
01:54:11,080 --> 01:54:12,280
an ad for the movie.

2277
01:54:12,280 --> 01:54:17,000
It's my opinion that the movie that truly did well for video games went overlooked.

2278
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:22,440
Silent Hill Revelation was the closest video game to film adaptation I've ever seen and

2279
01:54:22,440 --> 01:54:25,000
future video game related movies could learn from it.

2280
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:26,040
Which reminds me.

2281
01:54:26,040 --> 01:54:26,920
We still need to go see it.

2282
01:54:27,640 --> 01:54:29,320
I have another friend that wants to see it too.

2283
01:54:29,320 --> 01:54:29,880
Okay.

2284
01:54:29,880 --> 01:54:32,600
So we'll try to make that happen this week.

2285
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:36,600
Yeah, I can't really respond to that because I haven't seen Silent Hill Revelation still.

2286
01:54:37,240 --> 01:54:38,120
It's on my radar.

2287
01:54:38,120 --> 01:54:39,560
I want to get that scene this week.

2288
01:54:40,280 --> 01:54:42,680
So I'll have to come back to that next week.

2289
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:49,000
DDR Dollar Bill says I would have seen it if I had power but wanted to wonder if anyone

2290
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:53,400
else noticed how some reviewers were comparing this to Who Framed Roger Rabbit and that you

2291
01:54:53,400 --> 01:54:56,680
saw multiple characters from different franchises in the same movie.

2292
01:54:56,680 --> 01:55:01,640
You know, I didn't think I liked that comparison at first, but now I think I do because again

2293
01:55:01,640 --> 01:55:05,080
in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, none of those characters were the star.

2294
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:10,920
It was about, you know, Roger Rabbit and Christopher Lloyd's wacky character and all that

2295
01:55:10,920 --> 01:55:11,400
stuff.

2296
01:55:11,400 --> 01:55:12,520
So, and Jessica Rabbit.

2297
01:55:12,520 --> 01:55:14,120
You can't forget Jessica Rabbit.

2298
01:55:14,120 --> 01:55:15,560
It was really Eddie's story.

2299
01:55:15,560 --> 01:55:16,680
I guess that's true.

2300
01:55:16,680 --> 01:55:18,520
It's been years since I've seen that movie.

2301
01:55:18,520 --> 01:55:22,200
If you keep in mind the story it was based off of, Roger was dead.

2302
01:55:24,040 --> 01:55:28,760
All right, moving on to Dark Charger who says I saw this with my young son yesterday.

2303
01:55:28,760 --> 01:55:31,720
It's a great video game movie and a good movie overall.

2304
01:55:31,720 --> 01:55:35,720
While it doesn't belong in the pantheon of animated films, it is a great love letter

2305
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:39,720
to every sort of gamer, especially to those that live through the golden age of the arcade

2306
01:55:39,720 --> 01:55:41,800
who may enjoy this film even more.

2307
01:55:41,800 --> 01:55:46,600
I think that it drives strength in its narrative by not simply focusing on video games, but

2308
01:55:46,600 --> 01:55:48,840
by not forgetting about the characters.

2309
01:55:48,840 --> 01:55:49,720
It's a pretty good review.

2310
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:51,800
Before I forget.

2311
01:55:51,800 --> 01:55:52,280
Yeah.

2312
01:55:52,280 --> 01:55:55,240
The original story was who censored Roger Rabbit.

2313
01:55:55,240 --> 01:55:55,960
I'd forgotten.

2314
01:55:55,960 --> 01:55:57,480
I thought it was plugged, but no word.

2315
01:55:57,480 --> 01:55:58,040
All right.

2316
01:55:58,040 --> 01:56:00,920
Chiggers replied and said, I really liked Wreck-It Ralph.

2317
01:56:00,920 --> 01:56:05,880
My only complaint is that I wish they would have had more of the other classic game character.

2318
01:56:05,880 --> 01:56:06,760
Excuse me.

2319
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:10,200
I think you meant to say more of the classic game characters had more of a role.

2320
01:56:12,520 --> 01:56:16,840
I respect their decision to not do that because I think it would have taken away.

2321
01:56:17,640 --> 01:56:23,800
It was very interesting to me that one of the media supporting roles went to, and again,

2322
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:24,920
I don't think this is spoiling anything.

2323
01:56:24,920 --> 01:56:26,040
I think I'm okay saying this.

2324
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:31,160
One of the media supporting roles went to Qbert because Qbert's one of those characters

2325
01:56:31,160 --> 01:56:39,800
where it's like, he's not a Mario or a Sonic per se, but he's very recognizable.

2326
01:56:39,800 --> 01:56:43,640
If you were alive in the eighties or if you have a knowledge of eighties gaming, you know

2327
01:56:43,640 --> 01:56:44,520
what I mean?

2328
01:56:44,520 --> 01:56:45,880
Like, did you kind of feel that way, Jamie?

2329
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:49,160
That was a very interesting character to have be a supporting character.

2330
01:56:49,160 --> 01:56:49,640
Yeah.

2331
01:56:49,640 --> 01:56:51,000
Yeah, but it worked.

2332
01:56:51,800 --> 01:56:56,360
So anyhow, let's see, moving on.

2333
01:56:56,360 --> 01:57:00,920
The Rob D says it's undoubtedly a great thing for video games and gamers alike.

2334
01:57:00,920 --> 01:57:05,800
It's the first time that a company on the scale of Disney has deftly waived a great

2335
01:57:05,800 --> 01:57:09,880
story involving video games without resorting to cheap sensationalism.

2336
01:57:09,880 --> 01:57:14,600
As a lifelong gamer, I find it refreshing to see them treated as the creative medium

2337
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:18,760
and source of enjoyment for so many that they are, not something that only nerds and

2338
01:57:18,760 --> 01:57:20,200
basement dwellers partake in.

2339
01:57:20,760 --> 01:57:22,600
For me, the bottom line is this.

2340
01:57:22,600 --> 01:57:26,360
Wreck-It Ralph treats both video games and gamers with respect.

2341
01:57:26,360 --> 01:57:30,680
The people who created it did a wonderful job of capturing the joy of games and the

2342
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:32,600
world's Wii gamers experience.

2343
01:57:32,600 --> 01:57:36,360
This is the first time that's ever happened and they should be lauded for it.

2344
01:57:36,360 --> 01:57:39,640
Let's hope that this is the start of a trend and not an aberration.

2345
01:57:39,640 --> 01:57:41,640
That's a very solid comment.

2346
01:57:41,640 --> 01:57:42,200
I like that.

2347
01:57:43,160 --> 01:57:45,720
Uh, one more comment here from Degenerate Johnny.

2348
01:57:46,360 --> 01:57:48,120
This is also a very interesting comment.

2349
01:57:48,120 --> 01:57:51,880
I like this one a lot and this is the last one I'm going to read here from Facebook.com

2350
01:57:51,880 --> 01:57:53,480
slash Orange Lounge Radio.

2351
01:57:53,480 --> 01:57:57,720
Degenerate Johnny says, I will admit that the movie was quite entertaining and I think

2352
01:57:57,720 --> 01:58:01,400
that it places video games in a better light, which is something the industry needs.

2353
01:58:01,400 --> 01:58:05,320
However, I'm not sure if Wreck-It Ralph is a good thing for the progression of video

2354
01:58:05,320 --> 01:58:06,040
games.

2355
01:58:06,040 --> 01:58:10,280
The industry has grown up considerably since its inception, but it is still considered

2356
01:58:10,280 --> 01:58:14,760
by many media outlets, i.e. Fox News and CNN as a child's toy.

2357
01:58:15,400 --> 01:58:19,560
Therefore, having a successful family-friendly video game movie may be a form of support

2358
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:23,720
to those who heavily criticize the industry for its violent games.

2359
01:58:23,720 --> 01:58:28,280
Interactive entertainment is the entertainment of this age, as was Motion Pictures, the

2360
01:58:28,280 --> 01:58:30,440
entertainment of the industrial age.

2361
01:58:30,440 --> 01:58:34,280
Honestly, I don't think that it's fair to interpret an entertainment industry based

2362
01:58:34,280 --> 01:58:37,240
on its interactions with other forms of entertainment.

2363
01:58:37,800 --> 01:58:42,200
We don't interpret William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet through that horrid excuse

2364
01:58:42,200 --> 01:58:44,440
of a movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio.

2365
01:58:44,440 --> 01:58:47,800
The views and opinions of OLR's fans do not reflect that of OLR.

2366
01:58:47,800 --> 01:58:48,680
Damn right they don't.

2367
01:58:48,680 --> 01:58:49,640
I love that movie.

2368
01:58:49,640 --> 01:58:50,280
I'm sorry.

2369
01:58:50,280 --> 01:58:53,480
I hate that play so much because they're both stupid.

2370
01:58:53,480 --> 01:58:56,680
I do agree there's better Shakespeare plays than Romeo and Juliet for sure.

2371
01:58:56,680 --> 01:58:56,920
Really?

2372
01:58:56,920 --> 01:58:57,880
The theme of that?

2373
01:58:57,880 --> 01:58:58,680
Hi, we're stupid.

2374
01:58:58,680 --> 01:58:59,400
Let's kill each other.

2375
01:58:59,400 --> 01:58:59,720
The end.

2376
01:59:00,680 --> 01:59:04,840
Wreck-It Ralph was simply a fun-filled children's movie that I hope to God will only be viewed

2377
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:09,720
as such if interactive entertainment is to be accepted as the next form of entertainment.

2378
01:59:10,280 --> 01:59:13,960
I thought that was a very interesting comment because of the whole, and this is the part

2379
01:59:13,960 --> 01:59:18,280
that really got me, I don't think it's fair to interpret an entertainment industry based

2380
01:59:18,280 --> 01:59:21,560
on its interactions with other forms of entertainment.

2381
01:59:21,560 --> 01:59:23,080
What do you think about that statement?

2382
01:59:23,080 --> 01:59:25,000
Do you think that's a good statement that he's making there?

2383
01:59:26,120 --> 01:59:31,320
It does seem like, it does seem like gamers, especially in gaming blogs and the things

2384
01:59:31,320 --> 01:59:36,280
we read on the internet, it does seem like gamers are really obsessed with how does the

2385
01:59:36,280 --> 01:59:38,040
news report on us?

2386
01:59:38,040 --> 01:59:40,600
How do we get portrayed in movies?

2387
01:59:40,600 --> 01:59:46,360
What, you know, it does seem like that always peaks a curiosity and in this comment that's

2388
01:59:46,360 --> 01:59:50,680
kind of being called out as to why do we do that?

2389
01:59:50,680 --> 01:59:56,360
What other industry has success measured on how it's interpreted in other forms of art?

2390
01:59:58,280 --> 01:59:59,720
I just thought it was a neat way of looking at it.

2391
02:00:01,320 --> 02:00:05,560
Mm hmm.

2392
02:00:07,720 --> 02:00:11,000
It's very kind of, it actually strikes me as somewhat abstract.

2393
02:00:11,960 --> 02:00:12,360
Yeah.

2394
02:00:12,360 --> 02:00:21,480
I mean, if you look at taking one genre and portraying it in another genre, then any type

2395
02:00:21,480 --> 02:00:29,880
of biography about artists, about, shoot, toy story, toys coming to life and, and doing

2396
02:00:29,960 --> 02:00:30,280
stuff.

2397
02:00:31,800 --> 02:00:32,760
I guess that's true.

2398
02:00:32,760 --> 02:00:37,000
Some, some forms of art need each other to exist.

2399
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:41,640
And I might be, I might be going way off the page of what this commenter intended.

2400
02:00:41,640 --> 02:00:42,600
So I apologize.

2401
02:00:43,160 --> 02:00:46,280
But some forms of entertainment need each other to exist.

2402
02:00:46,280 --> 02:00:54,040
For example, music and movies, because silent movies were way different than movies today.

2403
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:59,000
Hell, even when there was silent movies, you needed, uh, the piano guy sitting there at

2404
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:03,480
the front playing, you know, those two industries have always really needed each other.

2405
02:01:03,480 --> 02:01:06,440
And some of the best music was inspired by movies.

2406
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:13,000
Or have you, well, music just goes with, like, here's going to be a really dumb example.

2407
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,320
Have you ever written California Screamin' without the soundtrack?

2408
02:01:16,040 --> 02:01:16,360
Yeah.

2409
02:01:16,360 --> 02:01:17,560
When my chair was broken.

2410
02:01:18,520 --> 02:01:19,960
Was it not a little different?

2411
02:01:19,960 --> 02:01:21,320
It was not as good.

2412
02:01:21,320 --> 02:01:22,040
Yeah.

2413
02:01:22,040 --> 02:01:24,920
Or changing the music and things.

2414
02:01:24,920 --> 02:01:30,360
That's why I really like how a lot of times for showing a suspenseful part in a movie

2415
02:01:30,360 --> 02:01:36,600
or a game, they'll just use silence instead of, you know, they'll let you focus on the

2416
02:01:36,600 --> 02:01:41,400
sounds going on, not just, you know, scary music to let you know it's scary.

2417
02:01:44,040 --> 02:01:48,520
And of course, we'll end it on this comment in the chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

2418
02:01:48,520 --> 02:01:52,200
Xenocore says, Rob, the answer to your question is porn.

2419
02:01:52,520 --> 02:01:56,920
And Robert M. also says that there are a lot of classic toys in Toy Story.

2420
02:01:58,840 --> 02:02:04,440
You know, what about books?

2421
02:02:04,440 --> 02:02:06,680
I mean, we've kind of had the Neverending Story.

2422
02:02:06,680 --> 02:02:07,240
What was that?

2423
02:02:07,240 --> 02:02:08,280
The Page Master?

2424
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:10,760
I mean, that people were into that movie.

2425
02:02:10,760 --> 02:02:19,480
I hate to say it, you know, you had or even take comics, you know, take different genre

2426
02:02:19,480 --> 02:02:22,680
of story and like, for example, the whole Fable series.

2427
02:02:23,320 --> 02:02:26,600
Actually, you just you just really hit on something because something that's really

2428
02:02:26,600 --> 02:02:32,760
huge now that wasn't as big years ago was the comics and movies.

2429
02:02:32,760 --> 02:02:34,600
That's like a huge thing in the industry now.

2430
02:02:34,600 --> 02:02:40,840
And really, like before the past few years, like you would occasionally have like Superman

2431
02:02:40,840 --> 02:02:46,520
was huge in the 70s and like Batman was huge in the 90s, the Burton series.

2432
02:02:46,520 --> 02:02:51,640
But like comics are kind of big in movies now in a way we haven't seen.

2433
02:02:51,640 --> 02:02:53,560
I have a reason to see Guardians of the Galaxy now.

2434
02:02:54,120 --> 02:02:54,840
Rocket Raccoon.

2435
02:02:56,040 --> 02:03:00,440
Anyway, but well, the whole reason I think with that and also why I think Rocket Ralph

2436
02:03:00,440 --> 02:03:09,560
is doing well is that the audience, the target audience being also the same age group of

2437
02:03:09,560 --> 02:03:14,440
an audience that's going to have the money and, you know, maybe have kids, but also be

2438
02:03:14,440 --> 02:03:15,720
the people who are going to get it.

2439
02:03:16,520 --> 02:03:19,000
That's the ones you want to market to is our age demographic.

2440
02:03:20,280 --> 02:03:25,880
And on top of that, we grew up, I grew up reading X-Men and Avengers, you know, I didn't

2441
02:03:25,880 --> 02:03:27,560
read DC because DC sucks.

2442
02:03:30,440 --> 02:03:33,480
Sorry, my allergies, my sinus infections getting the best of me.

2443
02:03:34,600 --> 02:03:37,720
But, you know, we grew up playing these games.

2444
02:03:37,720 --> 02:03:41,640
It's we are at the age that we are the ones with money and the influence.

2445
02:03:42,680 --> 02:03:45,480
Not in the corporate world, of course, because that's bullshit.

2446
02:03:46,200 --> 02:03:46,700
Occupy.

2447
02:03:48,040 --> 02:03:57,400
But as far as what dictates what's popular in pop culture, in modern popular culture,

2448
02:03:58,520 --> 02:03:59,480
we're the age group.

2449
02:04:01,240 --> 02:04:03,880
There are too many deep discussions happening on tonight's show.

2450
02:04:03,880 --> 02:04:04,440
I don't understand.

2451
02:04:04,440 --> 02:04:04,760
What is it?

2452
02:04:04,760 --> 02:04:05,880
What is in the air tonight?

2453
02:04:05,880 --> 02:04:08,120
Where am I taking fart jokes that I came here for?

2454
02:04:08,120 --> 02:04:09,240
I don't get it.

2455
02:04:09,240 --> 02:04:09,880
Don't worry.

2456
02:04:09,880 --> 02:04:11,800
My next story has raccoon penis in it.

2457
02:04:11,800 --> 02:04:13,080
OK, phew.

2458
02:04:13,080 --> 02:04:15,560
Well, before we get to your story, then we got to do a couple more.

2459
02:04:15,560 --> 02:04:16,920
So let's get back into some news.

2460
02:04:16,920 --> 02:04:20,760
Loki, we will be opening up the Skype line later if you want to call and voice your opinion

2461
02:04:20,760 --> 02:04:21,560
on any of this.

2462
02:04:21,560 --> 02:04:25,400
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

2463
02:04:25,400 --> 02:04:25,960
Sorry, Loki.

2464
02:04:25,960 --> 02:04:28,520
I needed to plug that before we get to the problem.

2465
02:04:29,160 --> 02:04:35,800
Since a lot of the whole online plan for the Wii U has been kind of nonexistent or hidden

2466
02:04:35,800 --> 02:04:41,560
or secret or whatever, it is kind of refreshing to see that there's some information, including

2467
02:04:41,560 --> 02:04:43,240
now what their web browser is going to be.

2468
02:04:43,240 --> 02:04:48,280
And I don't know if there's anything to really be excited about, but well, here we go.

2469
02:04:48,280 --> 02:04:54,280
So basically it's based off the whole net front browser, which has been used in pretty

2470
02:04:54,280 --> 02:05:01,240
much all the portable gaming systems, the DS, 3DS, PSP, Vita, and of course, you know,

2471
02:05:01,240 --> 02:05:01,800
the Wii U.

2472
02:05:04,040 --> 02:05:08,760
It's based a little bit off of, you know, they've got Mozilla kind of backing a little

2473
02:05:08,760 --> 02:05:10,520
bit of the Apple WebKit as well.

2474
02:05:12,120 --> 02:05:16,360
And then a little bit of, I guess, the Nintendo browser, which is good or bad.

2475
02:05:16,360 --> 02:05:18,360
It will support HTML5.

2476
02:05:18,360 --> 02:05:23,000
Of course, no Flash because, you know, everyone's kind of saying HTML5 is the way to go anyways.

2477
02:05:23,880 --> 02:05:28,360
Because if we had Flash, we'd be able to play all of those virtual console games for free.

2478
02:05:28,360 --> 02:05:30,200
And Nintendo has to know this.

2479
02:05:30,200 --> 02:05:31,160
They have to know this.

2480
02:05:31,160 --> 02:05:31,960
Of course, of course.

2481
02:05:31,960 --> 02:05:44,760
It's going to support MP4 files as well as live streaming, MPEG4, AVC video, the H.2.64

2482
02:05:45,560 --> 02:05:47,880
format, although some may not be playable.

2483
02:05:47,880 --> 02:05:56,520
And of course, it will support, you know, just the regular level HTML4, 5, XHTML 1.1,

2484
02:05:56,520 --> 02:06:01,960
CSS 1, 2, or 2.1 and 3, although those are partially functioning.

2485
02:06:01,960 --> 02:06:03,560
I guess 3 is partially functioning.

2486
02:06:04,120 --> 02:06:11,880
And they say even like video web storage is partially functioning, web messaging, and

2487
02:06:12,680 --> 02:06:13,640
some other stuff there.

2488
02:06:16,120 --> 02:06:20,360
No plugins, obviously, because it's built into the system there.

2489
02:06:20,360 --> 02:06:25,240
And I guess they're saying that the browser will support some, you know, touch events

2490
02:06:25,240 --> 02:06:28,360
stuff like a touch, start, touch, and move, cancel.

2491
02:06:28,360 --> 02:06:30,760
I'm assuming it's all the stuff that you would have with a touchpad.

2492
02:06:30,760 --> 02:06:31,800
Here's the thing.

2493
02:06:31,800 --> 02:06:35,640
Will it be fast and responsive and easy?

2494
02:06:35,640 --> 02:06:40,600
Because the problem with so many of these browsers on the TV and all this stuff is that

2495
02:06:40,600 --> 02:06:42,200
they run like shit.

2496
02:06:42,200 --> 02:06:45,480
It's faster to just whip my phone out of my pocket and get what I need.

2497
02:06:45,480 --> 02:06:53,160
Well, they're saying right now that it's supposed to be, I guess, you know, it does

2498
02:06:53,160 --> 02:06:54,920
support HTML 5.

2499
02:06:54,920 --> 02:07:01,000
And I guess because it renders HTML 5 websites more effectively than any other console, and

2500
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:08,360
they say even faster than Internet Explorer, they're saying that it's pretty good, I guess.

2501
02:07:09,240 --> 02:07:14,360
That's good because Internet Explorer on Xbox kind of blows because I mean, it's one of

2502
02:07:14,360 --> 02:07:16,280
the better browsers a system has had yet.

2503
02:07:16,280 --> 02:07:21,240
But like, it's so irritating that like when you go to vognetwork.com, even though we have

2504
02:07:21,240 --> 02:07:25,640
an HTML 5 player that will work on a smartphone, it will not work on the Xbox.

2505
02:07:25,640 --> 02:07:29,880
Like, OK, for example, they've got they have these ranking sites and I don't really know

2506
02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:35,080
how they got this information, but it's HTML 5 test and they have a gaming tab on there.

2507
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:41,000
And right now, you know, the two I mean, there's not a lot of gaming browsers that support

2508
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:44,040
HTML 5 through the 3DS and Xbox 360.

2509
02:07:44,040 --> 02:07:48,120
3DS got a 109, Xbox 360 is a 120.

2510
02:07:48,120 --> 02:07:52,680
And then, of course, the other browsers right now, I guess we does support a little bit

2511
02:07:52,680 --> 02:07:58,680
that we got a 94 in the DSI, a 94 in the Vita, a 58.

2512
02:07:59,960 --> 02:08:05,240
You know, in the course right now, they're saying, although it lists the Vita again,

2513
02:08:05,240 --> 02:08:10,040
I guess, for HTML 5, maybe that's like HTML 4 scores or something like that.

2514
02:08:10,040 --> 02:08:14,760
But for in the future or in development, the Wii U, a 323.

2515
02:08:15,400 --> 02:08:19,800
And I guess the Vita is a 243, I'm assuming that's maybe an update or something.

2516
02:08:19,800 --> 02:08:22,680
So I don't know, like I said, where they're getting their

2517
02:08:22,680 --> 02:08:25,880
information as far as how they're scoring that.

2518
02:08:25,880 --> 02:08:30,120
But. Interesting, I guess.

2519
02:08:31,640 --> 02:08:35,480
I'm trying to see if there's any other comparisons with like tablets.

2520
02:08:35,480 --> 02:08:38,120
OK, so let's let's look at tablets real quick.

2521
02:08:38,120 --> 02:08:41,480
And as you would expect, the tablets are better.

2522
02:08:42,200 --> 02:08:45,160
You know, the 323 is the Wii U's benchmark there.

2523
02:08:45,160 --> 02:08:49,320
And right now, you know, they have Opera Mobile 12.

2524
02:08:49,320 --> 02:08:51,880
That's a 406 and Chrome's 390.

2525
02:08:53,880 --> 02:08:56,120
Trying to see what else would be the closest there.

2526
02:08:57,400 --> 02:09:00,680
Even Windows Phone 8 is close 320.

2527
02:09:01,400 --> 02:09:03,480
IOS 6 is a 386.

2528
02:09:03,480 --> 02:09:05,400
Firefox mobile 388.

2529
02:09:05,400 --> 02:09:10,760
So it does sound like that your phone's going to be better at, you know, rendering those

2530
02:09:10,760 --> 02:09:12,760
pages, but it's not.

2531
02:09:13,800 --> 02:09:14,760
Not as bad even.

2532
02:09:15,400 --> 02:09:17,560
Fuck, even TV's are better at.

2533
02:09:18,840 --> 02:09:21,800
But for gaming out of gaming consoles, it is the best.

2534
02:09:22,600 --> 02:09:23,320
I don't know.

2535
02:09:23,320 --> 02:09:23,880
I don't know.

2536
02:09:23,880 --> 02:09:26,920
I don't know if that's really saying much, but all right.

2537
02:09:28,040 --> 02:09:29,960
When I can get my hands on it and try it.

2538
02:09:29,960 --> 02:09:32,840
That's when I can't really say say one way or the other.

2539
02:09:32,840 --> 02:09:34,200
Yeah, I just like a three.

2540
02:09:34,200 --> 02:09:35,320
I don't even know where they're getting.

2541
02:09:35,320 --> 02:09:38,520
Like it doesn't say what they're what they're testing.

2542
02:09:38,520 --> 02:09:43,480
I don't really know what they're testing and how how they're even testing it.

2543
02:09:43,480 --> 02:09:45,000
A system that's not out yet.

2544
02:09:46,440 --> 02:09:46,680
All right.

2545
02:09:46,680 --> 02:09:51,080
I have some potpourri news involving Nintendo, and it means I have a few little things I

2546
02:09:51,080 --> 02:09:51,800
want to get out here.

2547
02:09:52,600 --> 02:09:57,640
One of them is about some finally some details on what exactly the Nintendo Network premium

2548
02:09:57,640 --> 02:09:58,120
involves.

2549
02:09:58,840 --> 02:10:03,160
You remember the Wii U Deluxe Edition that has Nintendo Land as a packing game also gets

2550
02:10:03,160 --> 02:10:05,400
this whole Nintendo Network premium.

2551
02:10:05,400 --> 02:10:07,000
So what the hell is this all about?

2552
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:13,480
Well, basically, you get 10% back in points that you spend on the Wii U shop.

2553
02:10:13,480 --> 02:10:18,600
So if you get the 32 gig Wii U with the game, you get Nintendo Network premium and you get

2554
02:10:18,600 --> 02:10:22,440
10% back in points if you buy a Wii U game on the eShop.

2555
02:10:22,440 --> 02:10:25,480
So let's say you buy a game for $59.99.

2556
02:10:26,040 --> 02:10:28,280
10% of that's $5.99 points.

2557
02:10:28,280 --> 02:10:29,400
So there you go.

2558
02:10:29,400 --> 02:10:33,080
You get $5 in eShop credit for every 500 points.

2559
02:10:33,080 --> 02:10:40,760
So, you know, basically buying a game like what?

2560
02:10:40,760 --> 02:10:47,880
New Super Mario Brothers Wii U online would get you enough points to buy the original

2561
02:10:47,880 --> 02:10:49,400
Mario Brothers on the Virtual Console.

2562
02:10:50,760 --> 02:10:53,160
You know, so a little something there.

2563
02:10:53,160 --> 02:10:57,480
It's very similar to what the Vita does already, where you get 10% off.

2564
02:10:57,480 --> 02:11:02,600
But that 10% that you save is not tied to their store.

2565
02:11:02,600 --> 02:11:09,480
It's just money in your pocket versus having this money, you know, be honestly, I don't

2566
02:11:09,480 --> 02:11:11,720
see downloading games as kind of an option.

2567
02:11:11,720 --> 02:11:15,560
I mean, I don't know, like with how fickle I get with games and stuff like that.

2568
02:11:15,560 --> 02:11:19,720
Like you would want to have the option to sell it back or something.

2569
02:11:19,720 --> 02:11:23,960
And I just there's not really much that of an incentive, I guess.

2570
02:11:24,680 --> 02:11:25,000
All right.

2571
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,640
Some details coming out on New Super Mario Brothers U.

2572
02:11:28,600 --> 02:11:32,280
There is some more information on some of the different modes in the game,

2573
02:11:32,360 --> 02:11:37,640
including challenge mode, where you will have to do specific objectives like get the course

2574
02:11:37,640 --> 02:11:41,960
without touching the ground once or without ever picking up a coin.

2575
02:11:42,680 --> 02:11:47,320
There's categories that include time attack, coin collection, one up rally and special,

2576
02:11:47,320 --> 02:11:49,000
which is basically miscellaneous.

2577
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:52,680
There's also boost mode challenges that will require two players.

2578
02:11:52,680 --> 02:11:56,840
Once you complete a challenge, a replay is saved so you can show that off.

2579
02:11:56,840 --> 02:12:00,600
There's also coin battle where up to four players will go through the course and see

2580
02:12:00,600 --> 02:12:01,960
who can collect the most coins.

2581
02:12:02,440 --> 02:12:05,240
Not unlike the recent 3DS release.

2582
02:12:06,200 --> 02:12:12,600
Another player can use the Wii U game pad in boost mode to place boost blocks to help

2583
02:12:12,600 --> 02:12:14,840
grab a hard to reach coin.

2584
02:12:14,840 --> 02:12:20,520
You can use the game pad to edit and customize the coin layout in dedicated courses.

2585
02:12:20,520 --> 02:12:25,160
That layout can then be saved and played by players using the Wii remote controllers.

2586
02:12:27,480 --> 02:12:30,040
At least that sounds kind of new and interesting.

2587
02:12:30,040 --> 02:12:31,880
I'm curious how that plays out.

2588
02:12:31,880 --> 02:12:32,760
Coins everywhere!

2589
02:12:34,520 --> 02:12:35,160
World map.

2590
02:12:36,120 --> 02:12:42,040
This is the first game since Super Mario World that is a seamless world map with named worlds

2591
02:12:42,040 --> 02:12:45,240
and courses, secret exits which can change the map.

2592
02:12:45,240 --> 02:12:48,600
So it sounds like it's really modeled off of Super Mario World.

2593
02:12:48,600 --> 02:12:49,480
Not a bad thing.

2594
02:12:50,520 --> 02:12:51,640
And nabbit.

2595
02:12:52,440 --> 02:12:56,280
A creature named nabbit from time to time will appear on the world map if you enter

2596
02:12:56,280 --> 02:13:00,520
the course and catch nabbit to recover items stolen from Toad.

2597
02:13:01,160 --> 02:13:05,720
If you get nabbit you get a P acorn which will allow you to fly continuously through

2598
02:13:05,720 --> 02:13:06,600
an entire stage.

2599
02:13:06,600 --> 02:13:10,040
I'm assuming that is like the P wing from Mario 3.

2600
02:13:12,600 --> 02:13:13,800
And one other thing.

2601
02:13:14,520 --> 02:13:17,800
You know, Loki, you give Nintendo a lot of shit on this show.

2602
02:13:17,800 --> 02:13:20,680
But you got to applaud Nintendo for this comment this week.

2603
02:13:21,640 --> 02:13:28,120
Satoru Iwata in talking about Animal Crossing New Leaf on the Nintendo 3DS mentioning all

2604
02:13:28,120 --> 02:13:34,760
of the download content will be free because charging consumers for the DLC would not be

2605
02:13:34,760 --> 02:13:35,160
cool.

2606
02:13:35,160 --> 02:13:40,600
Quote, that sort of element paid DLC is absolutely not being added.

2607
02:13:40,600 --> 02:13:43,480
He went so far as to call it unwholesome.

2608
02:13:43,480 --> 02:13:47,800
So basically like, you know, they could have charged for new patterns and silly.

2609
02:13:47,800 --> 02:13:48,600
They're not going to do it.

2610
02:13:49,880 --> 02:13:53,160
They thought about it, but they decided not to do it.

2611
02:13:54,040 --> 02:13:58,920
Loki, Nintendo's biggest critic on this show, wasn't that the right call to make?

2612
02:13:59,560 --> 02:14:02,840
Well, yeah, it's the most common sense call to make.

2613
02:14:02,840 --> 02:14:07,640
And let's be honest, the first party companies aren't really the ones that are being known

2614
02:14:07,640 --> 02:14:09,320
for all this on disc content.

2615
02:14:09,320 --> 02:14:13,640
I don't think that Sony has a whole lot of games that kind of nickel and dime you for

2616
02:14:13,640 --> 02:14:14,200
things.

2617
02:14:14,200 --> 02:14:18,840
And I don't think that Microsoft has any similar games like that as well.

2618
02:14:18,840 --> 02:14:20,120
So cool.

2619
02:14:20,120 --> 02:14:22,280
You're on equal standing with everybody else.

2620
02:14:22,360 --> 02:14:23,320
Third party companies.

2621
02:14:23,320 --> 02:14:25,320
Well, that's a whole nother story.

2622
02:14:25,320 --> 02:14:28,040
They're kind of in their own ruleset, I guess.

2623
02:14:29,640 --> 02:14:31,240
All right, let's move on.

2624
02:14:31,240 --> 02:14:31,880
Dar Sakura.

2625
02:14:33,080 --> 02:14:37,320
Well, I brought it up.

2626
02:14:37,960 --> 02:14:39,000
I said it was true.

2627
02:14:39,640 --> 02:14:41,400
This story has to do with Raccoon Penis.

2628
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,880
What does Raccoon Penis have to do with video games?

2629
02:14:45,880 --> 02:14:52,920
It actually has to do with a digital art group called Massive Black.

2630
02:14:53,560 --> 02:14:59,880
And they've done a lot of concept art for Lord of the Rings Online, Infamous 2, Silent

2631
02:14:59,880 --> 02:15:01,880
Hill Shattered Memories, and Transformers 3.

2632
02:15:02,760 --> 02:15:05,720
They also developed their own game.

2633
02:15:05,720 --> 02:15:12,440
They have an artistic demo out called Moth Head that they're using to show the Unity

2634
02:15:12,440 --> 02:15:12,920
platform.

2635
02:15:13,320 --> 02:15:17,320
I downloaded this because, honestly, I had heard of the art piece that it was based off

2636
02:15:17,320 --> 02:15:17,880
of.

2637
02:15:17,880 --> 02:15:29,080
It's based off of a sculpture that is, well, it has a giant phallus on it made from the

2638
02:15:29,080 --> 02:15:30,840
real bone of a raccoon penis.

2639
02:15:32,040 --> 02:15:36,120
And if no one believes me, I will pull up the image and show everybody.

2640
02:15:36,120 --> 02:15:37,240
Oh, no, no, I believe you.

2641
02:15:37,240 --> 02:15:37,720
It's fine.

2642
02:15:37,720 --> 02:15:43,640
But they've done a demo called Moth Head, which is what the figure is called.

2643
02:15:43,640 --> 02:15:48,280
And basically, it's the figure headless with a moth attached to it.

2644
02:15:48,280 --> 02:15:54,440
You basically play as a moth going through this cavern, and then you merge with the creature

2645
02:15:55,000 --> 02:16:01,240
that looks like it was put together with different materials, and has kind of shiny insect skin.

2646
02:16:01,240 --> 02:16:03,640
And you solve puzzles as this creature.

2647
02:16:03,720 --> 02:16:09,080
It's actually supposed to be similar to, and I'm going to mispronounce this as Botanicula,

2648
02:16:09,080 --> 02:16:09,560
I think.

2649
02:16:11,240 --> 02:16:12,680
It's still a demo.

2650
02:16:12,680 --> 02:16:14,040
I mean, the controls aren't great.

2651
02:16:14,040 --> 02:16:15,080
I downloaded it.

2652
02:16:15,720 --> 02:16:20,200
It was originally conceived as a full length game, and they still want to do it.

2653
02:16:20,200 --> 02:16:27,160
But right now, it's sort of on hold while they finish their client's work, because they

2654
02:16:27,160 --> 02:16:30,680
still have huge groups that they're doing artwork for.

2655
02:16:30,760 --> 02:16:32,520
It's absolutely gorgeous to me.

2656
02:16:32,520 --> 02:16:40,520
I freaking love concept art, and just the fact that they would take this sculpture and

2657
02:16:40,520 --> 02:16:44,520
turn it into a figure in a game, just is sort of like combining two of my favorite things.

2658
02:16:45,160 --> 02:16:47,400
Find modern art and video games.

2659
02:16:47,400 --> 02:16:52,040
I'll post the link of the image in the chat room.

2660
02:16:53,560 --> 02:16:54,120
All right.

2661
02:16:54,120 --> 02:16:55,240
Let's move on, Loki.

2662
02:16:55,240 --> 02:16:55,740
All right.

2663
02:16:56,600 --> 02:16:58,840
So I don't know.

2664
02:16:58,840 --> 02:17:04,360
We talked about, we talked a lot about recent video, I don't even really call it a video

2665
02:17:04,360 --> 02:17:06,920
game movie, but a video game based movie.

2666
02:17:08,600 --> 02:17:11,800
Let's talk about another one that probably won't turn out as well.

2667
02:17:11,800 --> 02:17:16,040
And that would be Castle Wolfenstein, the movie.

2668
02:17:16,040 --> 02:17:21,480
Apparently, they've got Roger Avery back on his role as the writer and director for

2669
02:17:21,480 --> 02:17:21,980
the movie.

2670
02:17:22,520 --> 02:17:27,960
And this was a movie that was announced, what, five years ago?

2671
02:17:31,080 --> 02:17:38,120
So, yeah, I don't know if anyone's going to even remember what Castle Wolfenstein was,

2672
02:17:38,120 --> 02:17:43,320
at least any teenagers be seeing such a movie, but-

2673
02:17:43,320 --> 02:17:44,200
Doom level skip.

2674
02:17:46,200 --> 02:17:46,760
I don't know.

2675
02:17:47,640 --> 02:17:52,200
But anyways, their plot, if we must go back in there, a young U.S.

2676
02:17:52,200 --> 02:17:59,160
Army captain and British special agent are on a top secret mission to Castle Wolfenstein

2677
02:17:59,160 --> 02:18:01,160
where Hitler, who is a young U.S.

2678
02:18:01,160 --> 02:18:08,040
Army captain and British special agent, are on a top secret mission to Castle Wolfenstein

2679
02:18:08,040 --> 02:18:11,400
where Hitler will be unveiling a new secret weapon.

2680
02:18:12,760 --> 02:18:13,960
That sounds awfully generic.

2681
02:18:13,960 --> 02:18:16,760
Does this mean the Hitler robot that was the boss of one of the-

2682
02:18:16,760 --> 02:18:17,400
I hope so.

2683
02:18:17,400 --> 02:18:17,960
Oh, boy.

2684
02:18:19,560 --> 02:18:20,440
It could be.

2685
02:18:20,440 --> 02:18:22,040
I think it could be dumb fun.

2686
02:18:22,040 --> 02:18:24,120
As long as it's not attached to it, which he is.

2687
02:18:24,120 --> 02:18:25,160
Emphasis on dumb.

2688
02:18:26,520 --> 02:18:27,020
Yeah.

2689
02:18:28,200 --> 02:18:28,520
All right.

2690
02:18:28,520 --> 02:18:30,280
Well, I think this is kind of neat.

2691
02:18:30,280 --> 02:18:36,360
Now, you know, Sega is no stranger to repackaging their old shit and they've done it a lot, a

2692
02:18:36,360 --> 02:18:37,080
lot.

2693
02:18:37,080 --> 02:18:43,640
And, you know, the various collections, whether it be download, PC, or these little hook them

2694
02:18:43,640 --> 02:18:45,640
up directly to your TV things, right?

2695
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,080
There's a new one on the way out.

2696
02:18:49,080 --> 02:18:54,040
It's called the Sega Genesis Ultimate Portable Game Player, and it's coming out November

2697
02:18:54,040 --> 02:18:54,600
13th.

2698
02:18:54,600 --> 02:18:57,160
It's going to cost $59.99.

2699
02:18:57,160 --> 02:19:01,080
That's 60 bucks for a Genesis, but it has 80 games built in.

2700
02:19:01,080 --> 02:19:02,440
That was fakely like a nomad.

2701
02:19:03,320 --> 02:19:06,040
37 of them are going to be from Sega.

2702
02:19:06,040 --> 02:19:06,600
Oh, I'm sorry.

2703
02:19:06,600 --> 02:19:07,080
It is not.

2704
02:19:07,080 --> 02:19:09,320
It's this one that you plug into your TV.

2705
02:19:09,320 --> 02:19:11,000
No, it looks like a portable system, doesn't it?

2706
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:11,720
Might be both.

2707
02:19:11,720 --> 02:19:12,680
It could be both.

2708
02:19:13,400 --> 02:19:14,760
Do it with the nomad.

2709
02:19:15,640 --> 02:19:15,880
Yeah.

2710
02:19:15,880 --> 02:19:17,080
I'm trying to see real quick at that.

2711
02:19:18,040 --> 02:19:18,600
I'm not sure.

2712
02:19:18,600 --> 02:19:25,080
Anyway, there's 37 of these games from Sega, three from Capcom, and 40 from assortment

2713
02:19:25,080 --> 02:19:26,440
of other publishers.

2714
02:19:26,440 --> 02:19:27,240
Here's the thing.

2715
02:19:27,240 --> 02:19:32,600
One of those Capcom games that's going to be on this player, Mega Man, the Wily Wars.

2716
02:19:33,560 --> 02:19:39,080
Now, if you don't know what this game is, it's remakes of the first three Mega Mans

2717
02:19:39,080 --> 02:19:44,360
on the NES, along with a game called Wily Tower, like a little mini game.

2718
02:19:44,920 --> 02:19:47,160
It only ever actually came out in Japan and Europe.

2719
02:19:47,720 --> 02:19:54,040
It was on the Sega channel in the US, but how many people actually had the Sega channel?

2720
02:19:54,040 --> 02:19:57,160
So most people missed this when it was first out.

2721
02:19:57,160 --> 02:20:01,400
So it's very interesting that all these years later, the Wily Wars is actually going to

2722
02:20:01,400 --> 02:20:01,720
be out.

2723
02:20:01,720 --> 02:20:05,960
Now, I'm sure half of you out there have already emulated this at this point, but it's

2724
02:20:05,960 --> 02:20:10,760
still worth saying that this is on its way out and who knows what else, what other goodies

2725
02:20:10,760 --> 02:20:11,320
could be in there.

2726
02:20:11,320 --> 02:20:13,960
The only way we know about this one is it's on the box.

2727
02:20:13,960 --> 02:20:15,400
So who knows what else is in there?

2728
02:20:15,400 --> 02:20:17,480
That's pretty awesome.

2729
02:20:18,040 --> 02:20:19,880
That really is, honestly.

2730
02:20:19,880 --> 02:20:20,760
I mean, I've played it.

2731
02:20:20,760 --> 02:20:21,160
It's fun.

2732
02:20:21,720 --> 02:20:22,120
Yeah.

2733
02:20:22,120 --> 02:20:24,760
I remember the first three games are great.

2734
02:20:24,760 --> 02:20:29,720
Now, granted, there was also that PlayStation 2 GameCube collection that was also the...

2735
02:20:29,720 --> 02:20:32,680
And wasn't that the Wily Wars versions of the game?

2736
02:20:32,680 --> 02:20:33,640
Correct me if I'm wrong.

2737
02:20:33,640 --> 02:20:34,680
It's been a long time.

2738
02:20:36,920 --> 02:20:39,400
It's a 2.8 inch LCD screen.

2739
02:20:39,400 --> 02:20:40,840
It's a handheld player.

2740
02:20:40,840 --> 02:20:45,080
Rechargeable battery built in, USB cable included for charging battery.

2741
02:20:45,080 --> 02:20:46,600
Doesn't look like you can hook it up to the TV.

2742
02:20:46,600 --> 02:20:48,440
I still recommend Power Battle.

2743
02:20:50,440 --> 02:20:51,080
You never know.

2744
02:20:53,320 --> 02:20:53,960
All right.

2745
02:20:53,960 --> 02:20:54,600
So there you go.

2746
02:20:55,720 --> 02:20:57,960
Something new all these years later in the US.

2747
02:20:58,600 --> 02:20:59,800
Let's go to the email bag.

2748
02:20:59,800 --> 02:21:04,040
Every week we collect your emails at mailbag at orangelawntrader.com.

2749
02:21:04,040 --> 02:21:05,000
All one of them.

2750
02:21:05,000 --> 02:21:05,640
All one of them.

2751
02:21:05,640 --> 02:21:08,440
The Darkstalker is going to dive into the email bag and say,

2752
02:21:08,440 --> 02:21:09,160
Hello.

2753
02:21:09,160 --> 02:21:09,560
Hello.

2754
02:21:10,120 --> 02:21:11,240
And then she'll look on the ground.

2755
02:21:11,240 --> 02:21:13,480
Oh, one lone little email in here.

2756
02:21:13,480 --> 02:21:15,400
It got stuck to my toes.

2757
02:21:15,400 --> 02:21:17,560
Let me just reach down here and pick it up.

2758
02:21:18,520 --> 02:21:21,880
And she'll read that one email on the air here tonight.

2759
02:21:21,880 --> 02:21:22,680
And here it is.

2760
02:21:23,640 --> 02:21:28,680
I see that the stores have Wreck-It Ralph toys, but only three characters in the first wave.

2761
02:21:28,680 --> 02:21:33,320
Ralph Fix-It Felix Jr. and Ralph in the Hero's Duty armor.

2762
02:21:34,120 --> 02:21:34,520
Duty.

2763
02:21:35,240 --> 02:21:39,080
I understand why they can't flood the shelves of Bowser's, Clyde's and Cubert's.

2764
02:21:39,720 --> 02:21:41,480
Who even holds that license now?

2765
02:21:41,480 --> 02:21:45,080
I know a New York holding company licenses the Gotlight Pinball Tables.

2766
02:21:45,080 --> 02:21:47,320
But what about the arcade cabinet games?

2767
02:21:47,320 --> 02:21:51,480
But right now more of the movie's original characters seem to be Disney Store only.

2768
02:21:52,120 --> 02:21:56,440
And just to ask Loki, seriously this time, you mentioned suffering from weekend headaches.

2769
02:21:57,160 --> 02:21:59,160
This is something affecting me as well.

2770
02:21:59,160 --> 02:22:00,920
So what does your doctor think is causing it?

2771
02:22:00,920 --> 02:22:02,040
Allergies or stress maybe?

2772
02:22:02,840 --> 02:22:04,040
No, it'll go my doctor.

2773
02:22:05,880 --> 02:22:08,360
I think it's honestly, it's a combination of a bunch of things.

2774
02:22:08,360 --> 02:22:13,960
I think it's, it may be the fact that I wake up like every hour, a couple hours at night.

2775
02:22:13,960 --> 02:22:18,200
And it could be my pillow is just really uncomfortable sometimes or, you know.

2776
02:22:18,520 --> 02:22:21,000
Um, I should show you the pillow that I use.

2777
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:22,200
It got rid of most of my headaches.

2778
02:22:22,760 --> 02:22:26,600
Loki also gets a lot of stress caused by this show because he

2779
02:22:26,600 --> 02:22:29,240
pops blood vessels every time a Nintendo story comes up.

2780
02:22:29,240 --> 02:22:29,880
Let's be real.

2781
02:22:29,880 --> 02:22:31,240
I've seen that eye twitch.

2782
02:22:32,280 --> 02:22:33,400
That comes from Robert M.

2783
02:22:34,040 --> 02:22:37,480
Um, the first part of the thing about the licensed toys.

2784
02:22:37,480 --> 02:22:41,080
Um, I think honestly that just would have cost Disney extra money.

2785
02:22:41,080 --> 02:22:45,960
Disney doesn't want to push other people's properties.

2786
02:22:45,960 --> 02:22:48,040
They want to push their own properties.

2787
02:22:48,040 --> 02:22:51,080
And remember, and I don't know if you've actually seen the movie yet or what have you,

2788
02:22:51,080 --> 02:22:55,640
but remember the movie just uses all these licensed stuff to

2789
02:22:56,200 --> 02:23:00,840
kind of get you into the plot that involves characters that are not based off of real games.

2790
02:23:00,840 --> 02:23:03,720
So of course Disney wants to build their own characters.

2791
02:23:04,280 --> 02:23:07,960
So, you know, I think, I think that's what it really boils down to.

2792
02:23:08,600 --> 02:23:13,320
So, but I think you're right about it does seem like a lot of the characters they did use again

2793
02:23:13,320 --> 02:23:18,520
were, and a lot of the references were not necessarily the most popular games.

2794
02:23:18,520 --> 02:23:22,200
I mean, they're, they're recognizable games that doesn't make them the most popular.

2795
02:23:22,200 --> 02:23:24,200
For example, Dark Soccer already mentioned earlier in the show,

2796
02:23:24,200 --> 02:23:26,520
there's a reference to roadblasters in the movie.

2797
02:23:26,520 --> 02:23:32,440
I think everybody recognizes roadblasters, but did roadblasters really have that same

2798
02:23:33,320 --> 02:23:36,440
financial impact and did it make that same kind of money

2799
02:23:36,440 --> 02:23:40,280
that maybe other comparable racing games did like pole position per se?

2800
02:23:40,920 --> 02:23:44,280
Probably not. Or Iron Man, Off-Road, Stewart, that whole thing.

2801
02:23:44,280 --> 02:23:46,280
Probably not. But everybody recognizes it.

2802
02:23:46,280 --> 02:23:49,560
So I think there were just some really smart choices in what was used.

2803
02:23:49,560 --> 02:23:52,520
And because I'm sure somebody is going to mention it if I don't,

2804
02:23:52,520 --> 02:23:54,760
there's even a DDR reference in the very beginning.

2805
02:23:55,800 --> 02:23:59,000
Nobody's really playing DDR or anything. It's just the DDR.

2806
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:02,280
Uni is the one that calls out and it's in one of the trailers.

2807
02:24:02,280 --> 02:24:06,200
Uni is the one that kind of calls out the arcades closed, you know, that type of thing.

2808
02:24:06,200 --> 02:24:12,120
So, you know, and again, I doubt Uni cost an arm and a leg to license.

2809
02:24:12,120 --> 02:24:15,240
I think there is an actual DDR machine in the movie.

2810
02:24:15,240 --> 02:24:15,640
It is.

2811
02:24:15,640 --> 02:24:16,200
Yeah, there is.

2812
02:24:16,200 --> 02:24:17,960
There's an X2 machine, if I remember correctly.

2813
02:24:17,960 --> 02:24:18,760
Right at the start.

2814
02:24:18,760 --> 02:24:21,160
They licensed the likeness from Konami, I'm sure.

2815
02:24:21,160 --> 02:24:24,120
But that probably cost them a hell of a lot less than

2816
02:24:24,120 --> 02:24:26,600
licensing Simon Belmont would have cost, you know?

2817
02:24:27,160 --> 02:24:29,800
So they're smart.

2818
02:24:29,800 --> 02:24:35,960
Uh, Robert M in chat says, and technically, yes, but what I was saying was

2819
02:24:35,960 --> 02:24:40,280
hope and hopefully vanilla girl and Sergeant Calhoun will be later characters.

2820
02:24:40,280 --> 02:24:41,000
Oh, well, yes.

2821
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:43,080
I, I hope, I hope they are too.

2822
02:24:43,080 --> 02:24:44,200
Vanellope Von Schweetz.

2823
02:24:44,200 --> 02:24:45,160
Is that what you're talking about?

2824
02:24:46,360 --> 02:24:47,000
You know what?

2825
02:24:47,560 --> 02:24:50,840
She also made me think of Penelope Pitstop because the name was similar.

2826
02:24:51,640 --> 02:24:54,920
Even if Sarah Silverman annoys the shit out of you,

2827
02:24:54,920 --> 02:24:56,920
which I know she's a very controversial comedian.

2828
02:24:56,920 --> 02:24:59,720
I think she's hilarious, but I, I understand that she really

2829
02:24:59,720 --> 02:25:01,720
is like nails on a chalkboard to some people.

2830
02:25:01,720 --> 02:25:03,800
She does a really good job voicing that character.

2831
02:25:03,800 --> 02:25:06,600
She, she was a really good pick for that character because

2832
02:25:06,600 --> 02:25:09,720
that character is supposed to be a little bit nails on chalkboard,

2833
02:25:10,520 --> 02:25:12,600
but I thought that was a really good pick.

2834
02:25:12,600 --> 02:25:15,640
In fact, all the voice actors were really good.

2835
02:25:16,200 --> 02:25:19,880
Jane Lynch, especially was a great choice for that character.

2836
02:25:20,520 --> 02:25:21,320
She was perfect.

2837
02:25:21,320 --> 02:25:21,560
Yeah.

2838
02:25:21,560 --> 02:25:25,000
And, and, uh, the, the 30 Rock guy as Fix-It Felix.

2839
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:26,920
I mean, this is, they were all very great, great picks.

2840
02:25:28,200 --> 02:25:28,760
All right.

2841
02:25:28,760 --> 02:25:31,960
Uh, since that's it for the emails, shame, shame.

2842
02:25:31,960 --> 02:25:33,720
Mailbag at orange lounge, radio.com.

2843
02:25:33,720 --> 02:25:35,880
Send us more emails to read next week.

2844
02:25:35,880 --> 02:25:38,680
In the meantime, and don't tell us about, you know,

2845
02:25:38,680 --> 02:25:41,000
inheriting money from some guy in England.

2846
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:41,400
Yes.

2847
02:25:41,400 --> 02:25:45,800
Or your, you know, pyramid scheme or the French spam has to stop.

2848
02:25:46,920 --> 02:25:47,880
And the French spam.

2849
02:25:49,160 --> 02:25:49,960
All right.

2850
02:25:49,960 --> 02:25:51,720
Viva la French spam.

2851
02:25:52,120 --> 02:25:52,120


2852
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:53,560
All right.

2853
02:25:53,560 --> 02:25:56,520
Speaking of things that make us angsty, like French spam,

2854
02:25:57,320 --> 02:26:04,120
it's time for the FUs of the week.

2855
02:26:14,600 --> 02:26:19,080
My FUs are, first of all, to the end of my sinus infection,

2856
02:26:19,960 --> 02:26:22,360
to, uh, origin.

2857
02:26:22,360 --> 02:26:27,080
Well, actually specifically the patch for mass effect three and EA's customer

2858
02:26:27,080 --> 02:26:32,760
service was keeping me from being able to play my game without restriction and

2859
02:26:32,760 --> 02:26:36,120
all of it, but really I can't play it at all.

2860
02:26:37,080 --> 02:26:44,280
Um, and, uh, I had another one, but I'm distracted by raccoon penis.

2861
02:26:44,280 --> 02:26:55,480
Um, I guess just F you to, um, I'll F you to this whole week because we're

2862
02:26:55,480 --> 02:26:58,440
in the whole crux of like the fourth quarter stuff.

2863
02:26:58,440 --> 02:27:07,240
And fortunately in the position of distribution, um, see distribution

2864
02:27:07,240 --> 02:27:12,520
right now, it seems like they don't get call of duty black ops too early enough.

2865
02:27:12,520 --> 02:27:17,400
So the independent stores get theirs for midnight launch, which pisses off

2866
02:27:17,400 --> 02:27:21,240
everybody and keeps having those people ask, how am I supposed to stay in

2867
02:27:21,240 --> 02:27:23,320
business and compete against games?

2868
02:27:23,320 --> 02:27:25,400
It's like, listen, I'm not your fucking person.

2869
02:27:25,400 --> 02:27:27,720
That's supposed to tell you that if I told you that that'd be running your

2870
02:27:27,720 --> 02:27:28,040
store.

2871
02:27:28,760 --> 02:27:30,040
I'm not running your store.

2872
02:27:30,040 --> 02:27:32,200
I don't get paid enough to run your store.

2873
02:27:32,200 --> 02:27:36,680
You don't go up to, you know, you'll own a restaurant and go to your butcher

2874
02:27:36,680 --> 02:27:37,400
wherever you go out.

2875
02:27:37,400 --> 02:27:40,680
Why can't I compete with these other restaurant chains?

2876
02:27:40,680 --> 02:27:41,640
You know, it doesn't make any sense.

2877
02:27:42,280 --> 02:27:43,080
So it's annoying.

2878
02:27:43,080 --> 02:27:47,000
And on top of all that, the rest of my coworkers, sales staff gets to go to

2879
02:27:47,000 --> 02:27:49,080
Napa for fun three day weekend.

2880
02:27:50,200 --> 02:27:58,440
But because I landlocked the wife, I do not get to go to Napa.

2881
02:27:58,440 --> 02:28:00,680
Not that I was enjoying that because it's all wine tasting.

2882
02:28:00,680 --> 02:28:02,200
I fucking hate wine.

2883
02:28:02,200 --> 02:28:03,320
So I like wine.

2884
02:28:03,320 --> 02:28:04,360
No, I don't like wine.

2885
02:28:04,360 --> 02:28:06,200
See, I was excited about it cause I was like, sweet.

2886
02:28:06,200 --> 02:28:08,520
Second day is usually kind of that whole fun.

2887
02:28:08,520 --> 02:28:10,360
You get to go do whatever you want.

2888
02:28:10,360 --> 02:28:13,640
Well, they have like activities planned out, but now they only have one activity

2889
02:28:13,640 --> 02:28:14,840
and it's wine tasting.

2890
02:28:14,840 --> 02:28:16,920
See, my activity would be fuck all the activities.

2891
02:28:16,920 --> 02:28:20,920
I'm driving to Menlo Park and I'm going to go to fucking Cuzar.

2892
02:28:22,120 --> 02:28:24,440
But, uh, no, that's not gonna happen.

2893
02:28:24,440 --> 02:28:25,080
So it's fine.

2894
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:28,840
Um, I don't know.

2895
02:28:28,840 --> 02:28:32,440
I have general angst this week, but not things I can really put into words.

2896
02:28:32,440 --> 02:28:33,640
Just stuff and things.

2897
02:28:33,640 --> 02:28:37,240
So F you to stuff things.

2898
02:28:38,200 --> 02:28:39,000
That's all you get.

2899
02:28:40,520 --> 02:28:41,080
All right.

2900
02:28:41,080 --> 02:28:45,640
Uh, let's move on to a few more quick news stories and then we're going to get to your

2901
02:28:45,640 --> 02:28:50,840
calls at 1-877-GAMO-LR and Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

2902
02:28:50,840 --> 02:28:52,360
But first, two more stories for you.

2903
02:28:52,360 --> 02:28:52,840
Loki.

2904
02:28:52,840 --> 02:28:57,480
Well, we talked last week about some closures regarding, uh, Zynga and some of their Zynga

2905
02:28:57,480 --> 02:28:59,480
properties kind of going buh-bye.

2906
02:28:59,480 --> 02:29:07,080
So the first of those properties to be kind of going away, which goes to show how much

2907
02:29:07,080 --> 02:29:10,920
of this I'm actually, um, interested in, which is none of it.

2908
02:29:10,920 --> 02:29:12,040
Um, Fishville.

2909
02:29:13,240 --> 02:29:15,720
I mean, seriously, this whole Ville thing's got to stop.

2910
02:29:15,720 --> 02:29:21,400
I mean, it looks, it just sounds stupid, but Fishville and Treasure Isle are the first

2911
02:29:21,400 --> 02:29:25,240
two games, um, that will be kind of going by.

2912
02:29:25,240 --> 02:29:30,280
And, uh, this, they're going to stop running, um, on December 5th.

2913
02:29:30,920 --> 02:29:37,240
And I guess Fishville is a game where people fish.

2914
02:29:37,240 --> 02:29:38,840
I don't really, or are fish.

2915
02:29:38,840 --> 02:29:40,040
Imagine that.

2916
02:29:40,040 --> 02:29:40,440
I don't know.

2917
02:29:40,440 --> 02:29:44,120
It's, it's, I don't care.

2918
02:29:44,120 --> 02:29:45,480
Yeah, I really don't.

2919
02:29:45,480 --> 02:29:47,240
Um, yeah.

2920
02:29:48,360 --> 02:29:54,760
But they do refer to their players as Fishville-ers as, uh, this email from the Fishville team.

2921
02:29:55,560 --> 02:29:56,060
Yeah.

2922
02:29:56,680 --> 02:29:57,180
Hmm.

2923
02:29:57,820 --> 02:29:59,100
All right.

2924
02:29:59,100 --> 02:30:00,540
One more story for you guys.

2925
02:30:00,540 --> 02:30:03,580
Here's one for the classic OLR fans.

2926
02:30:03,580 --> 02:30:06,860
Uh, DDR Classroom Edition.

2927
02:30:06,860 --> 02:30:09,740
There's some extra information coming out about DDR Classroom Edition.

2928
02:30:09,740 --> 02:30:09,980
That's right.

2929
02:30:09,980 --> 02:30:15,340
That's kind of where DDR lives on now is in PE programs in schools, which I think is great.

2930
02:30:15,340 --> 02:30:18,780
You know, it's a great way to get kids involved in Dance Dance Revolution.

2931
02:30:18,780 --> 02:30:21,020
Here's the interesting thing about DDR Classroom Edition.

2932
02:30:21,020 --> 02:30:23,660
It's probably better than any other version of the game.

2933
02:30:23,660 --> 02:30:30,220
300 songs in the song list, including like some weird songs.

2934
02:30:30,220 --> 02:30:34,460
Songs have never been in DDR from like Walk It Out.

2935
02:30:34,460 --> 02:30:36,220
You know Konami did that game Walk It Out.

2936
02:30:36,220 --> 02:30:38,540
There's some songs from Walk It Out that are going to be in the game.

2937
02:30:39,180 --> 02:30:41,900
New tracks from 0039.com.

2938
02:30:41,900 --> 02:30:46,540
New dance mania licenses and several licenses from Sony Music Entertainment.

2939
02:30:46,540 --> 02:30:47,040
What?

2940
02:30:48,700 --> 02:30:52,380
Apparently going to get new music updates every three to six months.

2941
02:30:52,380 --> 02:30:56,700
After some successful location tests in Southern California and some schools there.

2942
02:30:57,580 --> 02:30:59,660
They're being very aggressive about the title.

2943
02:30:59,660 --> 02:31:07,980
Too bad it's something for schools and not for people to like actually get.

2944
02:31:07,980 --> 02:31:11,900
Well, here's the thing though is I think a lot of this stuff that they're probably licensing

2945
02:31:11,900 --> 02:31:16,460
for the Dance, uh, the Classroom Edition is probably going to end up in Dance Dance Revolution.

2946
02:31:16,460 --> 02:31:19,500
The fourth or fifth reboot of the franchise.

2947
02:31:19,500 --> 02:31:20,700
Oh, the new one coming out.

2948
02:31:20,700 --> 02:31:23,340
I think that'd be my guess because they're doing too many licenses.

2949
02:31:23,340 --> 02:31:26,780
I doubt they would dump that much money into a Classroom Edition,

2950
02:31:26,780 --> 02:31:28,940
which really doesn't need a diverse.

2951
02:31:29,740 --> 02:31:35,900
I mean, if you think about it, do you really need a diverse soundtrack for the Classroom Edition?

2952
02:31:36,780 --> 02:31:39,820
I mean, most, I'm assuming most of the stuff is going to be picked by the,

2953
02:31:40,380 --> 02:31:43,500
you know, the teacher in the class and no one's going to go,

2954
02:31:43,500 --> 02:31:49,100
Oh my goodness, I really want to hear that song by the Screaming Masks or

2955
02:31:50,940 --> 02:31:51,740
Trailers.

2956
02:31:51,740 --> 02:31:54,300
There's a pink song, So What?

2957
02:31:54,300 --> 02:31:55,660
I've heard that song on the radio.

2958
02:31:56,460 --> 02:31:58,540
Natasha Bedingfield, Pocket Full of Sunshine,

2959
02:31:58,540 --> 02:32:03,020
although I think wasn't that in the DDR release on the most recent PlayStation?

2960
02:32:03,020 --> 02:32:03,500
I don't know.

2961
02:32:05,820 --> 02:32:10,060
Chris Brown's song, you know, because they really should encourage his stuff in schools.

2962
02:32:10,700 --> 02:32:14,220
Uh, yeah, that's a huge song list though.

2963
02:32:14,220 --> 02:32:16,220
397 songs looking at the PDF.

2964
02:32:16,220 --> 02:32:17,660
But the question is-

2965
02:32:17,660 --> 02:32:18,860
I'm sure it ain't cheap.

2966
02:32:19,500 --> 02:32:24,860
Question is, and you know, thankfully they have this totally not sorted by artists.

2967
02:32:25,900 --> 02:32:26,780
Is Holic in the game?

2968
02:32:28,700 --> 02:32:29,980
Is Holic in there?

2969
02:32:29,980 --> 02:32:30,940
Holic is not in there.

2970
02:32:30,940 --> 02:32:31,980
At least I didn't see it.

2971
02:32:31,980 --> 02:32:33,260
Maybe future DLC.

2972
02:32:33,980 --> 02:32:35,020
Hot Limit though is.

2973
02:32:36,460 --> 02:32:36,960
Awesome.

2974
02:32:37,980 --> 02:32:39,340
You say Dramamine.

2975
02:32:39,900 --> 02:32:41,820
All right, uh, let's go to the phones.

2976
02:32:41,820 --> 02:32:45,980
1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2977
02:32:45,980 --> 02:32:47,820
The phones are now open.

2978
02:32:48,860 --> 02:32:50,060
You can give us a call.

2979
02:32:50,060 --> 02:32:54,620
I'm gonna go to the Twitter topics, but I gotta grab my iPad.

2980
02:32:54,620 --> 02:32:57,260
Loki, do you have any last minute stories?

2981
02:32:57,900 --> 02:32:59,500
No, I was just checking out-

2982
02:32:59,500 --> 02:33:00,000
Shit.

2983
02:33:01,660 --> 02:33:02,460
Stop it.

2984
02:33:02,460 --> 02:33:04,620
I was just checking out some of the songs that are in here.

2985
02:33:04,620 --> 02:33:06,700
I was just, you know, seeing what they've got here and-

2986
02:33:08,140 --> 02:33:09,260
I'm sorry, I was asleep.

2987
02:33:10,140 --> 02:33:14,540
They've got, um, they really don't have this in any sort of order.

2988
02:33:15,180 --> 02:33:18,300
But, uh, I'm trying to see if Holic is in here.

2989
02:33:18,300 --> 02:33:19,980
Holic is the best song ever.

2990
02:33:19,980 --> 02:33:21,420
They have, uh, Silent Hill.

2991
02:33:21,420 --> 02:33:23,180
Thomas Howard, you know, for Christmas.

2992
02:33:23,180 --> 02:33:23,900
So that's kind of cool.

2993
02:33:24,540 --> 02:33:25,040
Um.

2994
02:33:26,380 --> 02:33:28,620
Is that what happens in school now during the winter?

2995
02:33:28,620 --> 02:33:30,460
Is like DDR time?

2996
02:33:30,460 --> 02:33:33,100
You know, I think it'd be fucking awesome.

2997
02:33:33,820 --> 02:33:35,660
It would be really awesome to have that.

2998
02:33:35,660 --> 02:33:39,500
Because it was what Ultimate, like, it was like dodgeball or something like that.

2999
02:33:40,220 --> 02:33:41,420
What the hell did we used to do?

3000
02:33:41,420 --> 02:33:42,700
Play basketball maybe?

3001
02:33:42,700 --> 02:33:43,660
We used to do square dancing.

3002
02:33:43,660 --> 02:33:44,540
Yeah, we used to do square dancing.

3003
02:33:44,540 --> 02:33:45,660
Square dancing was the best.

3004
02:33:47,340 --> 02:33:47,900
You're weird.

3005
02:33:48,780 --> 02:33:51,500
I, it was the one thing I was good at.

3006
02:33:53,100 --> 02:33:54,220
Grab your partner.

3007
02:33:54,220 --> 02:33:55,260
That and pickleball.

3008
02:33:55,260 --> 02:33:56,540
Did you guys ever play pickleball?

3009
02:33:56,540 --> 02:33:57,180
No.

3010
02:33:57,180 --> 02:33:58,140
That was the other thing.

3011
02:33:58,140 --> 02:34:01,580
It was like, it was like tennis, but kind of like dumbed down a little bit.

3012
02:34:01,580 --> 02:34:05,180
We had, we had a game that we would play that was called Sink the Bismarck.

3013
02:34:05,820 --> 02:34:06,320
What?

3014
02:34:06,940 --> 02:34:09,020
After the ship from the World War.

3015
02:34:09,580 --> 02:34:16,380
But, um, but basically it was a, but you had two sides and you had a few students in the,

3016
02:34:16,380 --> 02:34:19,580
um, middle and they were the land, they were the water mines.

3017
02:34:20,220 --> 02:34:23,260
And so the students were all the ships crossing the ocean.

3018
02:34:23,980 --> 02:34:28,620
And if one of the land mines managed to touch, or not land mines, but the water mines

3019
02:34:28,620 --> 02:34:31,580
managed to touch one of the other students, then they became a mine and they had to stop

3020
02:34:31,580 --> 02:34:32,540
where they were.

3021
02:34:32,540 --> 02:34:34,860
And until the last one left was the winner.

3022
02:34:35,660 --> 02:34:36,160
So.

3023
02:34:39,900 --> 02:34:42,060
I just remember every Friday we had to run the mile.

3024
02:34:43,020 --> 02:34:49,420
Uh, let's see, going to Twitter topics at, uh, twitter.com slash O L R.

3025
02:34:49,420 --> 02:34:54,300
Um, thankfully there's no, let them move as to share 100.

3026
02:34:54,300 --> 02:34:55,340
Matt linked us this story.

3027
02:34:55,340 --> 02:34:59,500
I thought this was in our show role, but I think it just might've made not made this,

3028
02:34:59,500 --> 02:35:00,860
uh, this week.

3029
02:35:00,860 --> 02:35:01,500
I don't know.

3030
02:35:01,500 --> 02:35:04,220
Take two is going to be opening a new Las Vegas office.

3031
02:35:04,220 --> 02:35:04,460
Yeah.

3032
02:35:04,460 --> 02:35:06,780
You know, it was one of the stories you posted that we just didn't get to tonight.

3033
02:35:06,780 --> 02:35:11,100
Cause you, you talked to grand theft auto somewhere else, but, uh, yeah, 150 jobs in

3034
02:35:11,100 --> 02:35:16,140
Las Vegas, a brand new downtown office, Las Vegas region development agency is offering

3035
02:35:16,140 --> 02:35:18,540
up $600,000 in incentives to take two.

3036
02:35:18,540 --> 02:35:24,540
If they open the branch, I'm telling you, man, Vegas is a pretty awesome cause everyone

3037
02:35:24,540 --> 02:35:27,660
really thinks of Vegas is kind of like, Ooh, casinos and stuff like that.

3038
02:35:27,660 --> 02:35:31,340
But it's actually a pretty cool suburb with like really cheap housing.

3039
02:35:31,980 --> 02:35:32,860
And it's not bad.

3040
02:35:32,860 --> 02:35:36,940
If like you're not into the whole casino thing, it's still like a nice suburb.

3041
02:35:36,940 --> 02:35:40,300
I'm not sure if everybody who lives there would agree with you, but let's go to the

3042
02:35:40,540 --> 02:35:40,860
scene.

3043
02:35:40,860 --> 02:35:41,820
Like a nice suburb.

3044
02:35:41,820 --> 02:35:42,220
I don't know.

3045
02:35:42,220 --> 02:35:42,940
Hi, you're on orange.

3046
02:35:42,940 --> 02:35:43,500
Don's radio.

3047
02:35:43,500 --> 02:35:43,900
Who's this?

3048
02:35:44,620 --> 02:35:46,460
Uh, a survivor of the hurricane.

3049
02:35:46,460 --> 02:35:47,020
Ranma.

3050
02:35:47,020 --> 02:35:48,300
Hey, so you came out.

3051
02:35:48,300 --> 02:35:48,700
Okay.

3052
02:35:48,700 --> 02:35:48,940
Huh?

3053
02:35:49,500 --> 02:35:49,740
Yeah.

3054
02:35:49,740 --> 02:35:50,380
Pretty much.

3055
02:35:50,380 --> 02:35:54,700
Um, one of our studios, AKA Joe big day, uh, she lost power for a few days, but other

3056
02:35:54,700 --> 02:35:56,380
than that came out pretty good.

3057
02:35:56,380 --> 02:35:59,980
Well, you know, a lot worse things could happen than losing power for a few days.

3058
02:35:59,980 --> 02:36:05,980
I'm, I'm glad to hear places are recovering, you know, it's, it's, it's really tragic

3059
02:36:05,980 --> 02:36:09,500
seeing a lot of the stuff that's happening along the New Jersey shore and all that.

3060
02:36:09,500 --> 02:36:15,740
Like all the jokes about reality TV aside, like seeing that roller coaster just submerged

3061
02:36:15,740 --> 02:36:20,780
in water is just like, like jaw on floor type of thing.

3062
02:36:20,780 --> 02:36:23,100
It's just, it's, it's, it's upsetting.

3063
02:36:23,100 --> 02:36:29,660
But, um, you know, I know the photos of the train station is right by my house in the

3064
02:36:29,660 --> 02:36:31,900
one few little bit down the way.

3065
02:36:31,900 --> 02:36:33,660
So, you know, water had me spazzing.

3066
02:36:33,660 --> 02:36:38,620
And then like on Wednesday when he started saying, you can take trains, you can take

3067
02:36:38,700 --> 02:36:39,580
some of the buses.

3068
02:36:39,580 --> 02:36:43,580
Me and a couple of friends went down to Coney Island to survey some of the damage.

3069
02:36:43,580 --> 02:36:44,460
I saw the pictures.

3070
02:36:44,460 --> 02:36:47,420
It didn't seem like it was that bad.

3071
02:36:48,540 --> 02:36:50,700
Truth is it really wasn't.

3072
02:36:50,700 --> 02:36:52,380
It was just mostly water.

3073
02:36:52,380 --> 02:36:55,180
The beach itself was just, just wrecked.

3074
02:36:55,180 --> 02:37:00,620
Um, I did shoot video and one of the people I had spoken with, he said the main thing,

3075
02:37:00,620 --> 02:37:06,940
reason why most of Coney Island came out intact is because the, where the hurricane was coming

3076
02:37:06,940 --> 02:37:09,420
it wasn't coming in from the, from where the beach is.

3077
02:37:09,420 --> 02:37:11,100
It was coming in from...

3078
02:37:11,100 --> 02:37:13,900
It was coming up through land, wasn't it?

3079
02:37:14,540 --> 02:37:15,180
Say what?

3080
02:37:15,180 --> 02:37:16,460
Wasn't it coming up through land?

3081
02:37:17,180 --> 02:37:17,900
Yeah, pretty much.

3082
02:37:17,900 --> 02:37:18,140
Yeah.

3083
02:37:18,140 --> 02:37:23,740
So all the shops along Coney Island, like before you hit the beach, they took the brunt

3084
02:37:23,740 --> 02:37:24,460
end of everything.

3085
02:37:24,460 --> 02:37:26,780
By the time it got up, there was just really just a mass of wind.

3086
02:37:27,820 --> 02:37:28,780
Yeah, pretty much.

3087
02:37:28,780 --> 02:37:32,380
And now they're talking about another storm coming our way in about two days.

3088
02:37:32,380 --> 02:37:33,660
Oh, goodie.

3089
02:37:33,740 --> 02:37:36,940
Well, this is why you're supposed to fill your bathtub with water, have bleach, get

3090
02:37:36,940 --> 02:37:38,140
canned food, buy all the bread.

3091
02:37:38,860 --> 02:37:39,660
Tape your windows.

3092
02:37:41,180 --> 02:37:45,340
I did all of that and we had a big ol', a big ol' bucket of hurricane to drink.

3093
02:37:47,420 --> 02:37:51,020
But, but I, but I will tell you, welcome to my childhood.

3094
02:37:51,020 --> 02:37:54,060
Rama, I'm sure you didn't just call in to talk about the storm, but thank you for the

3095
02:37:54,060 --> 02:37:54,860
update.

3096
02:37:54,860 --> 02:37:55,820
What's on your mind tonight?

3097
02:37:56,380 --> 02:38:03,820
Um, my issues with Xbox and banning people for names and insults and stuff.

3098
02:38:03,820 --> 02:38:07,020
I mean, I kind of see both points on this.

3099
02:38:07,020 --> 02:38:12,460
It just feels like this is no different from being in high school and you're being bullied

3100
02:38:12,460 --> 02:38:16,940
and you're hearing N word, F word, K, all this, all this stuff.

3101
02:38:16,940 --> 02:38:25,020
And it's like, if you run your, if you go, go report it, this happens, that happens.

3102
02:38:25,020 --> 02:38:30,780
In a way, I kind of feel like, you know, just let them handle, let them handle their own

3103
02:38:30,780 --> 02:38:31,820
business, you know?

3104
02:38:32,460 --> 02:38:37,100
But on the same token, if it's just a bunch of friends running their mouth, having a good

3105
02:38:37,100 --> 02:38:41,180
time, you got that one person coming in, starting to freak out and then all hell breaks loose.

3106
02:38:41,180 --> 02:38:41,340
Yeah.

3107
02:38:41,340 --> 02:38:44,380
But if you're going to play with your friends, why would you let that one person in anyway?

3108
02:38:45,100 --> 02:38:48,860
Because you know, it's always in that, in the group is like, you always bring that one

3109
02:38:48,860 --> 02:38:50,300
person and like, Oh, don't worry.

3110
02:38:50,300 --> 02:38:50,940
He's cool.

3111
02:38:50,940 --> 02:38:51,500
He's understanding.

3112
02:38:51,500 --> 02:38:52,380
Oh, she's cool.

3113
02:38:52,380 --> 02:38:53,420
She's understandable.

3114
02:38:53,420 --> 02:38:56,220
And then you're like, and you find a little, Oh shit.

3115
02:38:56,220 --> 02:39:00,540
Or back in the day when we do PSO and only three of us were online and we wanted a fourth

3116
02:39:00,540 --> 02:39:05,660
to do, uh, the full challenge, we would, uh, just go to open lobby, the three of us and

3117
02:39:05,660 --> 02:39:06,860
pull another person.

3118
02:39:06,860 --> 02:39:07,100
Yeah.

3119
02:39:07,100 --> 02:39:11,340
You can kind of, um, also one thing to remember about the Xbox 360, cause we've done this

3120
02:39:11,340 --> 02:39:16,140
with Mass Effect 3 a lot is that you can go into party mode and you can chat in the little

3121
02:39:16,140 --> 02:39:21,260
party chat that's on your crossbar or whoops, that's the Sony thing, whatever they call

3122
02:39:21,420 --> 02:39:24,620
the, you know, the main interface on Xbox dashboard, it's on your dashboard.

3123
02:39:24,620 --> 02:39:27,980
So like, you know, like Shane and I might be playing Mass Effect and maybe we have,

3124
02:39:27,980 --> 02:39:30,540
you know, acidic vampire, Oscar, somebody with us.

3125
02:39:30,540 --> 02:39:34,700
It's like the three of us will be in the party chat and then we'll bring in a random fourth,

3126
02:39:34,700 --> 02:39:39,180
but they can't hear us because we're in the party chat and that dialogue doesn't go out

3127
02:39:39,180 --> 02:39:39,660
in game.

3128
02:39:39,660 --> 02:39:42,780
So, you know, we have to remember the Xbox does have that infrastructure set up.

3129
02:39:42,780 --> 02:39:46,460
So if you do want to bring in randoms to fill out your party, you know, you can still have

3130
02:39:46,460 --> 02:39:49,660
your closed conversation without worrying about offending some stranger.

3131
02:39:51,500 --> 02:39:52,380
There we go.

3132
02:39:52,380 --> 02:39:52,620
Yeah.

3133
02:39:52,620 --> 02:39:56,300
So that is, that's the solution, but still, I, I still get what you're saying, you know,

3134
02:39:56,300 --> 02:40:01,020
where, you know, you don't want that one per, cause still you could be bringing somebody

3135
02:40:01,020 --> 02:40:07,900
into your little party chat that maybe you kind of didn't estimate correctly and maybe

3136
02:40:07,900 --> 02:40:08,940
we'll take offense.

3137
02:40:08,940 --> 02:40:15,900
But I think, I don't know, I guess Microsoft to some extent maybe has a, has a responsibility

3138
02:40:15,900 --> 02:40:19,820
to not regulate private games the same way they would regulate a public game.

3139
02:40:20,060 --> 02:40:21,260
Well, that works for me.

3140
02:40:21,260 --> 02:40:26,060
Just like if I want to say in the privacy of my own home, I want to say every offensive

3141
02:40:26,060 --> 02:40:28,620
word I can think of and believe me, I know a lot of them.

3142
02:40:28,620 --> 02:40:31,420
If I want to say those in the privacy of my own home where nobody ever hears them, but

3143
02:40:31,420 --> 02:40:33,740
Alan, you know, that's between Alan and I, right?

3144
02:40:34,300 --> 02:40:35,180
Yep.

3145
02:40:35,180 --> 02:40:40,220
Although some would argue it's toxic to use those words in any circumstance, but that's

3146
02:40:40,220 --> 02:40:42,140
a debate for another time, I suppose.

3147
02:40:42,140 --> 02:40:42,940
Yes, definitely.

3148
02:40:44,940 --> 02:40:47,260
So gosh, anything else still on your mind tonight, buddy?

3149
02:40:47,900 --> 02:40:50,780
A friend of mine did a voice in Wreck-It Ralph.

3150
02:40:50,780 --> 02:40:51,580
Oh really?

3151
02:40:51,580 --> 02:40:52,140
What voice?

3152
02:40:52,140 --> 02:40:52,620
Do you know?

3153
02:40:53,340 --> 02:40:54,140
He was Ryu.

3154
02:40:55,180 --> 02:40:56,140
Get out!

3155
02:40:56,140 --> 02:40:57,740
That's awesome.

3156
02:40:58,940 --> 02:41:02,300
It was a quick scene, but it was, it was funny.

3157
02:41:02,300 --> 02:41:03,180
Everybody laughed.

3158
02:41:04,300 --> 02:41:05,180
That's very cool.

3159
02:41:05,180 --> 02:41:08,380
And if everything goes according to plan, I'll be going to see it this week dressed

3160
02:41:08,380 --> 02:41:09,980
as Luigi and I will have pictures.

3161
02:41:09,980 --> 02:41:10,620
There you go.

3162
02:41:10,620 --> 02:41:13,500
Even though sadly, I'm sad to report, Luigi's not in the movie.

3163
02:41:13,500 --> 02:41:14,540
It doesn't matter.

3164
02:41:14,540 --> 02:41:15,500
It doesn't matter.

3165
02:41:15,500 --> 02:41:17,500
Luigi's still number one, super guy.

3166
02:41:20,460 --> 02:41:23,100
Well, we need, so you haven't seen Wreck-It Ralph yet?

3167
02:41:23,100 --> 02:41:23,980
No, I have not.

3168
02:41:23,980 --> 02:41:26,620
Well, we do need the movie to be black Luigi approved.

3169
02:41:26,620 --> 02:41:28,140
So, um, you know.

3170
02:41:28,140 --> 02:41:29,420
So will the Wii U launch.

3171
02:41:31,260 --> 02:41:32,860
We need stories from the Wii U launch.

3172
02:41:32,860 --> 02:41:35,100
I don't, I don't, I don't know what's going on here.

3173
02:41:35,100 --> 02:41:38,620
Like I, everything about this launch is very mysterious to me.

3174
02:41:38,620 --> 02:41:40,860
Like, I don't, like, it seems like it's all done in pre-orders.

3175
02:41:40,860 --> 02:41:42,220
Like, are people even camping out?

3176
02:41:42,220 --> 02:41:43,580
Is that a thing anymore?

3177
02:41:44,060 --> 02:41:45,260
People are camp.

3178
02:41:46,620 --> 02:41:48,300
My younger brother, Greg.

3179
02:41:48,300 --> 02:41:51,980
He, upon hearing about the pre-orders and all of this, he sends me a message.

3180
02:41:52,700 --> 02:41:55,900
You are coming with me to camp out for the Wii U, right?

3181
02:41:56,460 --> 02:41:57,580
I guess.

3182
02:41:57,580 --> 02:41:59,180
You are coming, right?

3183
02:41:59,180 --> 02:41:59,900
Okay.

3184
02:41:59,900 --> 02:42:01,020
I will be there.

3185
02:42:01,020 --> 02:42:02,140
Just save me some soup.

3186
02:42:02,860 --> 02:42:03,980
I don't want to camp out.

3187
02:42:03,980 --> 02:42:06,380
I just want to go on Amazon and have him ship it.

3188
02:42:06,380 --> 02:42:07,580
Like, I'm just lazy.

3189
02:42:08,380 --> 02:42:09,900
I'm too old to camp out.

3190
02:42:10,700 --> 02:42:11,980
You haven't ordered it yet?

3191
02:42:12,780 --> 02:42:13,580
I don't care.

3192
02:42:13,580 --> 02:42:14,460
And I don't want one.

3193
02:42:15,420 --> 02:42:18,380
I'm hoping I have connections that can help me get one.

3194
02:42:18,380 --> 02:42:20,540
Well, I plan on getting one, so.

3195
02:42:20,540 --> 02:42:21,020
There you go.

3196
02:42:21,020 --> 02:42:22,700
Well, you have to let us know how it is.

3197
02:42:22,700 --> 02:42:23,500
Oh, by the way.

3198
02:42:24,140 --> 02:42:26,620
I'm just, I'm buying it so I can just put it on eBay.

3199
02:42:28,540 --> 02:42:30,140
One thing real quick about Wreck-It Ralph.

3200
02:42:31,020 --> 02:42:35,100
The little film at the very beginning of it will give you sniffles.

3201
02:42:35,740 --> 02:42:37,740
It was so paper man.

3202
02:42:37,740 --> 02:42:38,700
The little short.

3203
02:42:38,700 --> 02:42:39,820
Cause that's like a thing now.

3204
02:42:39,820 --> 02:42:43,420
A lot of the Pixar movies and Disney, even Disney classics have these shorts in front of them.

3205
02:42:43,420 --> 02:42:43,900
Yeah, it was really good.

3206
02:42:43,900 --> 02:42:46,380
It was called paper man and it was really sweet.

3207
02:42:46,380 --> 02:42:47,260
It was cute.

3208
02:42:47,260 --> 02:42:48,140
It was cute.

3209
02:42:48,140 --> 02:42:48,460
All right.

3210
02:42:49,100 --> 02:42:52,380
Referring paper man to slender man, but I'll be it from me.

3211
02:42:52,380 --> 02:42:52,620
All right.

3212
02:42:52,620 --> 02:42:54,540
Well, Rama, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls.

3213
02:42:54,540 --> 02:42:55,180
Okay.

3214
02:42:55,180 --> 02:42:55,500
All right.

3215
02:42:55,500 --> 02:42:55,820
Cool.

3216
02:42:55,820 --> 02:42:56,060
All right.

3217
02:42:56,060 --> 02:42:56,860
Bye.

3218
02:42:56,860 --> 02:42:57,360
Bye.

3219
02:42:59,020 --> 02:43:00,460
Always nice to hear from Rama.

3220
02:43:00,460 --> 02:43:04,780
One of the hosts of anime jam session Tuesdays on the voice of geeks network.

3221
02:43:04,780 --> 02:43:08,940
Although I didn't mention this during the show, but some of you probably picked on or I picked

3222
02:43:08,940 --> 02:43:13,580
up on this, our feed was down for like four days this week.

3223
02:43:13,580 --> 02:43:14,700
It was pretty crazy.

3224
02:43:15,260 --> 02:43:18,460
So some of our programming got rolled over to next week.

3225
02:43:18,460 --> 02:43:19,580
Critical myth.

3226
02:43:19,580 --> 02:43:24,940
We'll be back, uh, next week with some of the episodes that got missed due to the outage.

3227
02:43:24,940 --> 02:43:28,940
I think the Warcraft shows, unfortunately, they're just going to have to be missed.

3228
02:43:29,740 --> 02:43:31,260
But anyway, we got another call coming in.

3229
02:43:31,260 --> 02:43:32,220
So let's go to the phones.

3230
02:43:32,220 --> 02:43:33,260
Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

3231
02:43:33,260 --> 02:43:33,660
Who's this?

3232
02:43:34,620 --> 02:43:36,860
Hey guys, it's the one and only degenerate Johnny.

3233
02:43:37,660 --> 02:43:39,020
What is up degenerate Johnny?

3234
02:43:39,020 --> 02:43:41,580
You wrote that comment on Facebook earlier, right?

3235
02:43:41,580 --> 02:43:42,140
Yes, I did.

3236
02:43:42,140 --> 02:43:44,460
I called into follow up on that.

3237
02:43:44,460 --> 02:43:45,020
Please do.

3238
02:43:46,460 --> 02:43:46,780
All right.

3239
02:43:46,780 --> 02:43:55,500
So basically it seems to me that, you know, gaming in the culture that we live today,

3240
02:43:56,140 --> 02:43:59,900
it still hasn't really gotten it through these people's heads.

3241
02:43:59,900 --> 02:44:06,620
I mean, look back a few years back, um, Fox news, you know, I geeked out when Fox news

3242
02:44:06,620 --> 02:44:09,980
was saying, Oh yeah, we're going to have a, we're going to talk about mass effect.

3243
02:44:09,980 --> 02:44:11,580
I'm like, Oh my goodness.

3244
02:44:11,580 --> 02:44:16,380
And it was nothing but a bash fest over that 30 second love scene.

3245
02:44:16,380 --> 02:44:19,020
I'm like, what the hell is this crap?

3246
02:44:19,020 --> 02:44:24,060
Of which, of which there is much worse stuff shown on Fox television.

3247
02:44:25,260 --> 02:44:26,460
Like, exactly.

3248
02:44:26,460 --> 02:44:30,140
You know, I mean, good.

3249
02:44:30,140 --> 02:44:30,860
Oh, that's it.

3250
02:44:30,860 --> 02:44:35,260
Just, I was just saying like glee and house and all those shows have far worse content.

3251
02:44:36,060 --> 02:44:36,380
Right.

3252
02:44:36,380 --> 02:44:36,860
Exactly.

3253
02:44:36,860 --> 02:44:42,460
And even their quote unquote expert, uh, Cooper Lawrence said it herself that she saw, you

3254
02:44:42,460 --> 02:44:48,060
know, sayings and loss that were actually more explicit than that love scene, you know.

3255
02:44:49,980 --> 02:44:57,580
But, you know, it seems, it seems amazing to me that, you know, nothing has evolved

3256
02:44:57,580 --> 02:45:00,700
ever since, you know, 1993.

3257
02:45:00,700 --> 02:45:06,620
This is where I think the gaming industry has evolved from a child's toy was the moment

3258
02:45:06,620 --> 02:45:12,940
that Congress approached the electronic software association after Mortal Kombat and Doom and

3259
02:45:12,940 --> 02:45:14,460
saying, Hey, you know what?

3260
02:45:14,460 --> 02:45:20,300
We appreciate, you know, what you guys are doing, but now your content has more than

3261
02:45:20,300 --> 02:45:21,820
one form of audience.

3262
02:45:21,820 --> 02:45:24,060
You have to separate it.

3263
02:45:24,060 --> 02:45:30,460
And, you know, from that point, I think that was a turning point from us being a child's

3264
02:45:30,460 --> 02:45:36,620
toy or a fad into actually becoming, you know, the next form of entertainment.

3265
02:45:38,380 --> 02:45:41,660
And well, let me, let me, let me throw this out there just to be devil's advocate.

3266
02:45:41,660 --> 02:45:44,540
It's not that I disagree with you, but I want to throw this thought out here and see what

3267
02:45:44,540 --> 02:45:48,620
you think about this because 20 years ago, which, you know, 93 was almost 20 years ago

3268
02:45:48,620 --> 02:45:54,300
at this point, another industry that faced a lot of battles in Congress was the music

3269
02:45:54,300 --> 02:45:55,180
industry.

3270
02:45:55,180 --> 02:45:59,420
And this is because gangster rap started to take a storm a little bit.

3271
02:45:59,420 --> 02:46:03,420
And this is where that whole little black and white sticker that says parental advisory

3272
02:46:03,420 --> 02:46:05,340
caution explicit lyrics came from.

3273
02:46:05,340 --> 02:46:08,300
And a lot of this is perpetuated by the same person between the two.

3274
02:46:08,300 --> 02:46:08,540
Yeah.

3275
02:46:08,540 --> 02:46:09,100
Hilarious.

3276
02:46:09,100 --> 02:46:09,580
Right.

3277
02:46:09,580 --> 02:46:16,620
But, but, but, well, you know, where it came from regardless, you know, music doesn't get

3278
02:46:16,620 --> 02:46:22,860
that same, pardon the pun, rap that video games does and being accepted in mainstream

3279
02:46:22,860 --> 02:46:23,260
culture.

3280
02:46:23,260 --> 02:46:28,060
Although I guess one could argue, there's still a lot of people that say gangster rap's

3281
02:46:28,060 --> 02:46:28,940
not music.

3282
02:46:28,940 --> 02:46:29,740
It's garbage.

3283
02:46:30,860 --> 02:46:34,540
There's people out there that feel that way, whether they're right or wrong.

3284
02:46:34,540 --> 02:46:39,180
So I, you know, it's, it's just interesting to me that, you know, music fought a lot of

3285
02:46:39,180 --> 02:46:40,940
that stuff in the nineties too.

3286
02:46:40,940 --> 02:46:41,260
Yet.

3287
02:46:42,220 --> 02:46:46,700
Oh, I mean, it fought, it fought against that battle, you know, way before then.

3288
02:46:46,700 --> 02:46:50,220
I mean, hell, the Beatles were, were considered the devil's music.

3289
02:46:51,340 --> 02:46:52,700
Play the records backwards.

3290
02:46:52,700 --> 02:46:53,020
Remember?

3291
02:46:54,060 --> 02:46:54,300
Yeah.

3292
02:46:55,740 --> 02:46:59,980
I was like, how am I worshiping the devil when I'm hearing, I want to hold your hand.

3293
02:46:59,980 --> 02:47:00,460
What the hell?

3294
02:47:01,740 --> 02:47:06,460
Because it's you, it's you wanting to hold the devil's hand as you walk through the lakes

3295
02:47:06,460 --> 02:47:08,140
of fire in a fiery hell.

3296
02:47:09,020 --> 02:47:10,700
Oh, dear Lord, Lordy.

3297
02:47:10,700 --> 02:47:11,580
Oh my goodness.

3298
02:47:14,620 --> 02:47:14,940
Yeah.

3299
02:47:14,940 --> 02:47:16,700
It, you know, it just astounds me.

3300
02:47:16,700 --> 02:47:21,420
And, you know, you know, the follow up on, you know, what I also said is that, you know,

3301
02:47:22,220 --> 02:47:29,980
I do agree with you that entertainment today actually requires, you know, you know, technology

3302
02:47:30,940 --> 02:47:31,900
and it has evolved.

3303
02:47:31,900 --> 02:47:34,140
I mean, hell, that is what the saying is.

3304
02:47:34,140 --> 02:47:36,540
Art is alive and it evolves.

3305
02:47:36,540 --> 02:47:43,100
I mean, you know, like I said in chat was, you know, the gladiatorial arts was the entertainment

3306
02:47:43,100 --> 02:47:51,420
for the Roman society and it now has evolved to cage fighting, boxing, if you want storyline,

3307
02:47:51,420 --> 02:47:53,020
pro wrestling, you know.

3308
02:47:53,020 --> 02:47:58,620
And so I've been actually studying up on this and seeing how, you know, all these forms

3309
02:47:58,620 --> 02:48:06,940
of entertainment, obviously still some entertainments, you know, are a little, you know, they cling

3310
02:48:08,540 --> 02:48:11,820
to their old ways, you know, tradition, which I do respect.

3311
02:48:11,820 --> 02:48:17,820
You know, there's obviously plays and playwrights and it, you know, as a matter of fact, you

3312
02:48:17,820 --> 02:48:23,580
know, what you and Jessica Harper recently did with Rocky Horror, you know.

3313
02:48:23,580 --> 02:48:28,460
I mean, that is a, you know, a form of evolution from, you know, the plays and playwrights

3314
02:48:28,460 --> 02:48:30,860
and, you know, it's becoming, you know.

3315
02:48:32,860 --> 02:48:37,500
It's funny you bring that up because that in particular is something that is, I actually

3316
02:48:37,500 --> 02:48:38,780
was at Rocky Horror last night.

3317
02:48:38,780 --> 02:48:42,540
That's why I got home at five in the morning because I was with one of the Bay Area cast

3318
02:48:42,540 --> 02:48:45,340
who was celebrating their 17th birthday as a cast.

3319
02:48:45,340 --> 02:48:47,100
Rocky Horror, I know, right?

3320
02:48:47,100 --> 02:48:51,900
Rocky Horror is something that's been around for 35 years, but it is interesting.

3321
02:48:51,900 --> 02:48:52,860
You talk about it.

3322
02:48:52,860 --> 02:48:54,620
Oh God, I could fill another show with this.

3323
02:48:55,180 --> 02:48:56,780
You just set me on a tangent.

3324
02:48:56,780 --> 02:49:00,860
It is interesting that that whole stuff could be considered another art form because there's

3325
02:49:00,860 --> 02:49:06,060
other movies now that, you know, people want to kind of shadow cast and bring to that.

3326
02:49:06,060 --> 02:49:09,900
And especially with the group I've been working with here in Sacramento, they really have

3327
02:49:09,900 --> 02:49:10,860
made an art out of it.

3328
02:49:10,860 --> 02:49:15,020
I mean, I know I'm talking them up, but you've got to see the way they do repo the genetic

3329
02:49:15,020 --> 02:49:15,820
opera.

3330
02:49:15,820 --> 02:49:19,980
I mean, like that movie for all practical purposes is kind of stupid.

3331
02:49:19,980 --> 02:49:25,500
But when you see the stage show of it, you're like, is this shit for real?

3332
02:49:25,500 --> 02:49:27,260
This is crazy.

3333
02:49:27,260 --> 02:49:30,220
And I mean, words can only came and describe it.

3334
02:49:30,220 --> 02:49:34,140
You know, it is the exactly the atmosphere.

3335
02:49:34,140 --> 02:49:37,500
And now they're talking about doing it for, and I don't know how much I'm supposed to

3336
02:49:37,500 --> 02:49:40,540
stay on my little radio show or not, but now they're talking about doing it for the room.

3337
02:49:40,540 --> 02:49:43,340
And there was talk about doing Scott Pilgrim versus the world at one point.

3338
02:49:43,340 --> 02:49:44,380
They've had to put that on hold.

3339
02:49:44,380 --> 02:49:47,420
I think it's a rights thing, but that was like going to be a thing.

3340
02:49:48,060 --> 02:49:53,020
So, yeah, well, Jessica said something last night on under sedation life that she was

3341
02:49:53,020 --> 02:49:55,580
actually going to be doing something that involves the room.

3342
02:49:55,580 --> 02:50:00,780
Yeah, I, I, I, I have mixed feelings about the room, but anyway, we'll leave that to

3343
02:50:00,780 --> 02:50:01,420
another show.

3344
02:50:02,300 --> 02:50:02,620
All right.

3345
02:50:02,620 --> 02:50:04,780
But let me, let me, let me go back to video games of this.

3346
02:50:04,780 --> 02:50:09,500
I want to ask you about this so, so we can wrap up, um, because you did kind of make

3347
02:50:09,500 --> 02:50:11,100
the comment on Facebook.

3348
02:50:11,180 --> 02:50:19,260
Let me ask you, what would you like to see happen next with the video game movie working

3349
02:50:19,260 --> 02:50:21,180
hand in hand together in this fusion?

3350
02:50:21,180 --> 02:50:23,340
What would you see like to see happen next with that?

3351
02:50:23,340 --> 02:50:26,140
Or do you think we need to stop obsessing about it?

3352
02:50:27,340 --> 02:50:32,940
Honestly, I think we need to stop obsessing for, uh, on it because you know, you look

3353
02:50:32,940 --> 02:50:40,460
at the past, the two industries never really, you know, you know, they never really, you

3354
02:50:40,460 --> 02:50:45,740
know, generate a form of like something that's really successful.

3355
02:50:45,740 --> 02:50:51,340
There's never been a real successful video game that has been based off of movie and

3356
02:50:51,340 --> 02:50:58,380
you have never really seen a movie, a very successful movie, uh, you know, uh, being

3357
02:50:58,380 --> 02:50:59,500
based off of a game.

3358
02:50:59,500 --> 02:51:05,020
I don't see Oscar winning award games and I know we all want to see Mass Effect on the

3359
02:51:05,020 --> 02:51:08,140
big screen and you want to see Warcraft on the big screen.

3360
02:51:09,100 --> 02:51:12,060
But those movies are gonna suck.

3361
02:51:12,060 --> 02:51:16,300
Let's be, if you are a fan of those games, there is no possible way those movies are

3362
02:51:16,300 --> 02:51:17,500
going to satisfy you.

3363
02:51:17,500 --> 02:51:24,780
And I think I really do see your point here because there is no possible way, no possible

3364
02:51:24,780 --> 02:51:29,820
way you can adapt the Mass Effect games into a movie and leave people satisfied.

3365
02:51:29,820 --> 02:51:35,340
They will be pissed just like Harry Potter fans always are mad that the books aren't

3366
02:51:35,340 --> 02:51:36,700
adapted correctly.

3367
02:51:36,780 --> 02:51:40,700
I'm sure somebody's got a problem with Lord of the Rings, although to be fair, they do

3368
02:51:40,700 --> 02:51:41,260
it okay.

3369
02:51:41,260 --> 02:51:44,860
But I mean, it's just Mass Effect is a video game.

3370
02:51:44,860 --> 02:51:46,460
It is not going to work as a movie.

3371
02:51:46,460 --> 02:51:50,460
But here's why Wreck-It Ralph worked because Wreck-It Ralph wasn't a game.

3372
02:51:50,460 --> 02:51:53,180
It was a movie about gaming culture.

3373
02:51:53,980 --> 02:51:54,620
Exactly.

3374
02:51:55,580 --> 02:52:02,700
And I think, and that's why Hope is just, is viewed as a story that, you know, revolve,

3375
02:52:02,700 --> 02:52:06,860
you know, and it's a little bit, you know, involves the characters that we all love to

3376
02:52:06,860 --> 02:52:07,580
play with.

3377
02:52:07,580 --> 02:52:11,180
But I just hope it doesn't go past that.

3378
02:52:11,180 --> 02:52:16,220
It's like, you know, and still is, you know, conceived as a, you know, what video games

3379
02:52:16,220 --> 02:52:21,180
are today as, you know, a child's toy because we have progressed so much beyond that point.

3380
02:52:22,300 --> 02:52:22,620
All right.

3381
02:52:22,620 --> 02:52:25,820
Well, Degener, Johnny, I gotta let you go so we can see if we can get another call and

3382
02:52:25,820 --> 02:52:26,540
wrap up the show.

3383
02:52:26,540 --> 02:52:27,660
But great phone call.

3384
02:52:27,660 --> 02:52:28,460
Don't be a stranger.

3385
02:52:29,020 --> 02:52:29,420
All right.

3386
02:52:29,420 --> 02:52:29,740
All right.

3387
02:52:29,740 --> 02:52:30,620
Take care.

3388
02:52:30,620 --> 02:52:31,120
Bye.

3389
02:52:31,120 --> 02:52:32,480
Bye.

3390
02:52:32,480 --> 02:52:33,200
Really good points.

3391
02:52:33,200 --> 02:52:37,200
We, I, he hasn't called into the show an awful lot, but I like some of the stuff, some of

3392
02:52:37,200 --> 02:52:38,320
the points he was raising there.

3393
02:52:38,320 --> 02:52:40,080
So definitely worth talking to.

3394
02:52:40,080 --> 02:52:40,720
Appreciate it.

3395
02:52:41,440 --> 02:52:43,120
We are the show where every gamer has a voice.

3396
02:52:43,120 --> 02:52:47,200
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

3397
02:52:47,200 --> 02:52:50,160
If we can get another call in here real quick, we'll take it.

3398
02:52:50,160 --> 02:52:52,720
Otherwise, we might just wrap up for the night.

3399
02:52:52,720 --> 02:52:56,640
Let me go to Twitter though, cause I still had some more of these tweets I wanted to

3400
02:52:56,640 --> 02:53:02,240
get to, including one from Tiger Claw that talks about the Halo 4 Amex card thing.

3401
02:53:02,960 --> 02:53:07,360
I remember reading a little bit about this, but you know, I don't have an American Express

3402
02:53:07,360 --> 02:53:10,480
myself, so I just kind of scrolled on by.

3403
02:53:10,480 --> 02:53:15,280
But apparently there is a, excuse me, there is a partnership between Microsoft and American

3404
02:53:15,280 --> 02:53:19,760
Express so that if you are a card holder, you get coupons and credits for tying your

3405
02:53:19,760 --> 02:53:22,240
account to Xbox Live and playing Halo 4.

3406
02:53:23,840 --> 02:53:24,960
Very interesting.

3407
02:53:24,960 --> 02:53:30,240
If you sync your Amex account to your Xbox Live account, you can get coupons to theaters,

3408
02:53:30,240 --> 02:53:31,600
packs on, dah, dah, dah, dah.

3409
02:53:32,240 --> 02:53:36,560
An automatic credit of $10 in the US or 10 pounds in the UK.

3410
02:53:36,560 --> 02:53:41,040
If you play Halo 4, you get credits and coupons on your in-game achievements.

3411
02:53:42,640 --> 02:53:46,880
If you complete the single-player campaign on normal or harder difficulty, you get a

3412
02:53:46,880 --> 02:53:49,040
$25 statement credit.

3413
02:53:49,120 --> 02:53:55,920
If you are one of the first 25 people in the US to complete the campaign alone on legendary

3414
02:53:56,560 --> 02:54:03,200
difficulty, you will be entered to win a trip to the 2013 Electronic Entertainment Expo.

3415
02:54:03,200 --> 02:54:08,960
Well, that's not irritating or anything because, you know, E3 is a very exclusive thing to

3416
02:54:08,960 --> 02:54:12,960
be able to get into, but apparently you can win your way in through Amex.

3417
02:54:14,320 --> 02:54:17,440
I'm glad that the integrity is being kept up.

3418
02:54:17,440 --> 02:54:24,320
Yes, I'm so glad that we're keeping the independent press out of the events for the nasty, filthy

3419
02:54:24,320 --> 02:54:28,720
things they'll say about it on the internet, yet we're gonna let a contest winner from

3420
02:54:28,720 --> 02:54:31,840
American Express get their way into the show.

3421
02:54:31,840 --> 02:54:33,280
Uh-huh, I see how it is.

3422
02:54:35,120 --> 02:54:37,520
Let's see, you talked about the Wizard of the Coast lawsuit thing, right?

3423
02:54:37,520 --> 02:54:39,280
Because we have a tweet on that, but you already talked about that.

3424
02:54:40,320 --> 02:54:42,800
Let's see, another tweet from actdeft.

3425
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:46,400
Is DRM going too far?

3426
02:54:47,440 --> 02:54:51,360
Sorry, I'm reading the story here real quick.

3427
02:54:51,360 --> 02:54:51,920
Let me look at this.

3428
02:54:53,280 --> 02:54:54,240
The title of the...

3429
02:54:54,240 --> 02:54:55,840
This is a forum post, okay?

3430
02:54:56,560 --> 02:54:59,600
He links us to a forum post on overclock.net.

3431
02:54:59,600 --> 02:55:05,360
Razor Synapse 2.0 software mouse unusable if you don't have an internet connection.

3432
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:12,640
The poster, who goes by Channel X99, just bought a new Naga 2012 mouse, installed the

3433
02:55:12,640 --> 02:55:16,160
software, and got greeted by a login screen right after.

3434
02:55:16,160 --> 02:55:19,600
No option to bypass it to use the software to configure the mouse.

3435
02:55:19,600 --> 02:55:22,720
Set the options, sensitivity, shortcuts, macros, etc.

3436
02:55:22,720 --> 02:55:24,880
So I create an account and try to log in.

3437
02:55:24,880 --> 02:55:25,600
Nothing.

3438
02:55:25,600 --> 02:55:27,200
Try several more times.

3439
02:55:27,200 --> 02:55:27,840
Nothing.

3440
02:55:27,840 --> 02:55:28,960
Try to make new accounts.

3441
02:55:28,960 --> 02:55:31,040
Different email addresses won't work.

3442
02:55:31,040 --> 02:55:36,400
Finally, call Razor, who tells me the activation server is down, and I won't be able to use

3443
02:55:36,400 --> 02:55:41,040
the mouse until it goes back up, and will only be able to use it as a standard plug

3444
02:55:41,040 --> 02:55:42,400
and play mouse till then.

3445
02:55:42,960 --> 02:55:47,760
I ask about a workaround to use the mouse offline, and they say there is none.

3446
02:55:49,200 --> 02:55:50,160
That's a stupid...

3447
02:55:50,160 --> 02:55:52,800
That's completely awful.

3448
02:55:52,800 --> 02:55:55,280
That I would be writing a letter to the Better Business Bureau.

3449
02:55:55,280 --> 02:55:56,960
Which I'm about to be doing for Origin.

3450
02:55:58,720 --> 02:56:00,240
But D.R., you can't...

3451
02:56:01,440 --> 02:56:03,680
Do they sell counterfeit mice?

3452
02:56:03,680 --> 02:56:04,560
I mean, is that a thing?

3453
02:56:04,560 --> 02:56:09,760
I don't want to get political, but I'm honest to God, this is the first thought that jumps

3454
02:56:09,760 --> 02:56:10,800
into my mind.

3455
02:56:10,880 --> 02:56:14,880
There's this very controversial proposition on the ballot in California.

3456
02:56:14,880 --> 02:56:16,400
It's Prop 37.

3457
02:56:16,400 --> 02:56:19,360
And it has to do with labeling certain types of food.

3458
02:56:19,360 --> 02:56:23,120
I'm not going to get into where I'm leaning on this proposition or whatever.

3459
02:56:23,120 --> 02:56:24,080
I'm just going to say it's...

3460
02:56:25,520 --> 02:56:31,040
If it passes, there's going to be additional warning labels on food and restrictions on

3461
02:56:31,040 --> 02:56:33,040
what can be called a natural food or not.

3462
02:56:34,240 --> 02:56:38,800
The reason why I bring that up, that mouse ought to carry a fucking sticker on it.

3463
02:56:38,800 --> 02:56:39,760
Bright and big.

3464
02:56:39,760 --> 02:56:44,160
Will not work without an internet connection because you, the buyer, have the right to

3465
02:56:44,160 --> 02:56:45,840
know that shit before you buy it.

3466
02:56:47,200 --> 02:56:48,720
Take the mouse back, buddy.

3467
02:56:48,720 --> 02:56:50,080
Especially a mouse like that.

3468
02:56:50,080 --> 02:56:51,520
We're not talking like a $20 mouse.

3469
02:56:51,520 --> 02:56:54,240
We're talking like $100 plus mice.

3470
02:56:55,680 --> 02:56:57,600
There is no reason...

3471
02:56:57,600 --> 02:56:59,680
There should be a warning label on that mouse.

3472
02:57:00,560 --> 02:57:02,720
And any video game that requires this shit.

3473
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:06,640
Because an internet connection is an additional fee, right?

3474
02:57:06,640 --> 02:57:10,880
Most MMOs I've played who have a sticker requires internet connection to play.

3475
02:57:10,880 --> 02:57:11,840
Even games.

3476
02:57:11,840 --> 02:57:15,520
Okay, that's a little understandable that they have DRM because they want to avoid piracy.

3477
02:57:15,520 --> 02:57:20,480
What the fuck is DRM supposed to be for like an accessory, hardware?

3478
02:57:20,480 --> 02:57:24,640
What the fuck do you need DRM for for a mouse?

3479
02:57:24,640 --> 02:57:25,680
Shouldn't there be like...

3480
02:57:25,680 --> 02:57:30,480
I hate to sound stupid and I might by saying this, but I don't care.

3481
02:57:30,480 --> 02:57:35,760
Shouldn't there be like antitrust shit involved because you're forcing somebody to log up

3482
02:57:35,760 --> 02:57:40,240
for your crap because you bought this particular product at the store?

3483
02:57:41,120 --> 02:57:48,240
It's like you're making somebody sign up for this other service because of your foothold

3484
02:57:48,240 --> 02:57:49,280
in the mouse keyboard.

3485
02:57:50,320 --> 02:57:52,480
Isn't there a questionable legality to that?

3486
02:57:53,840 --> 02:57:56,800
I mean, maybe because we're talking about a mice and keyboard company.

3487
02:57:56,800 --> 02:57:59,680
It's kind of a niche market at gamers.

3488
02:57:59,680 --> 02:58:05,200
They do have their $2,500 laptop that's coming out this week as well.

3489
02:58:05,760 --> 02:58:06,080
Hmm.

3490
02:58:08,240 --> 02:58:08,640
Let's see.

3491
02:58:08,640 --> 02:58:11,520
Go into our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

3492
02:58:11,520 --> 02:58:15,120
TigerClaw says the only thing I'm doing with the mouse or keyboard is turning the LEDs

3493
02:58:15,120 --> 02:58:16,000
on or off.

3494
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:19,280
So when I go to bed, I just load up the software to turn them off.

3495
02:58:19,280 --> 02:58:23,680
All other features it has I don't use because that's mostly features associated to gaming.

3496
02:58:25,280 --> 02:58:31,840
One more tweet from actdeft who says fairy solitaire is free to download on steam for

3497
02:58:31,840 --> 02:58:32,560
a few days.

3498
02:58:33,760 --> 02:58:34,400
Who knew that?

3499
02:58:35,200 --> 02:58:35,920
Get it now.

3500
02:58:35,920 --> 02:58:37,120
Keep it forever.

3501
02:58:37,120 --> 02:58:42,480
If you want the addicting card game fairy solitaire where you find and raise a fairy

3502
02:58:42,480 --> 02:58:47,760
pet and repopulate the magical land of Avalon using the resources found by clearing each

3503
02:58:47,760 --> 02:58:48,400
level.

3504
02:58:48,400 --> 02:58:51,360
Sounds like you can get that on steam for free right now.

3505
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:55,600
And honestly, you should if you're even if you're not really that interested in it, if

3506
02:58:55,600 --> 02:58:58,160
you're mildly interested because hey, it's free.

3507
02:58:58,160 --> 02:59:00,560
I know I'm giggling there, but you know what?

3508
02:59:00,560 --> 02:59:02,320
Props to them making it free.

3509
02:59:02,320 --> 02:59:03,200
How can you?

3510
02:59:04,080 --> 02:59:05,600
I'm sure it's better than Yaris.

3511
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:11,360
That is a very low bar to take seed there.

3512
02:59:13,280 --> 02:59:19,280
All right, that's going to do it for our Twitter topic tonight and the other interactive parts

3513
02:59:19,280 --> 02:59:19,840
of our show.

3514
02:59:21,040 --> 02:59:22,720
We're going to close up shop.

3515
02:59:24,640 --> 02:59:26,720
And Skype just like freeze my computer.

3516
02:59:27,840 --> 02:59:28,720
Thanks Skype.

3517
02:59:28,720 --> 02:59:30,880
You drop the live listeners and everything.

3518
02:59:30,880 --> 02:59:32,160
Sorry, that was Skype's fault.

3519
02:59:32,560 --> 02:59:33,520
Not Comcast fault.

3520
02:59:33,520 --> 02:59:34,480
That was Skype's fault.

3521
02:59:35,040 --> 02:59:36,320
Sorry for the stream drop there.

3522
02:59:37,280 --> 02:59:37,600
All right.

3523
02:59:37,600 --> 02:59:41,920
Anyhow, that's going to do it for telephone calls and Twitter and all that good stuff.

3524
02:59:41,920 --> 02:59:43,520
Let's send the show.

3525
02:59:43,520 --> 02:59:45,280
Do you have any other last minute stories either?

3526
02:59:45,280 --> 02:59:46,560
You guys have something to say?

3527
02:59:46,560 --> 02:59:46,720
Yeah.

3528
02:59:46,720 --> 02:59:48,320
What tomorrow is my mom's birthday.

3529
02:59:48,320 --> 02:59:49,280
So happy birthday, mom.

3530
02:59:49,280 --> 02:59:50,320
Even though you don't listen.

3531
02:59:50,320 --> 02:59:52,960
Happy birthday to dark soccer's mom, even though she doesn't listen.

3532
02:59:52,960 --> 02:59:53,460
Yeah.

3533
02:59:54,160 --> 02:59:56,080
Loki, any other last minute stories or anything?

3534
02:59:56,080 --> 02:59:57,120
It's about slow news.

3535
02:59:57,120 --> 03:00:00,880
We have anything MXC and chat says don't knock it.

3536
03:00:00,880 --> 03:00:04,480
I tried playing fairy solitaire on a whim and can't stop playing.

3537
03:00:04,480 --> 03:00:05,840
It's been three hours.

3538
03:00:08,640 --> 03:00:12,000
I have another thing to say, but I'll say it for last.

3539
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:13,360
I want to quickly say this.

3540
03:00:13,360 --> 03:00:18,640
Shane, if you're listening and you're in chat, will you link the listeners that game you

3541
03:00:18,640 --> 03:00:21,040
were talking to me earlier on Warcraft about?

3542
03:00:21,040 --> 03:00:22,080
It was hilarious.

3543
03:00:22,080 --> 03:00:23,840
I wish she'd called in to talk about it.

3544
03:00:23,840 --> 03:00:25,680
It sounded hilarious.

3545
03:00:25,680 --> 03:00:30,640
You like start playing the game and it looks like an edutainment title that's about fractions,

3546
03:00:30,640 --> 03:00:35,680
but then he was talking about how like it just starts pulling, like it gets weirder

3547
03:00:35,680 --> 03:00:41,520
and weirder and weirder and like suddenly you're like at the top of this government

3548
03:00:41,520 --> 03:00:45,200
conspiracy and it turns into a text adventure game.

3549
03:00:45,840 --> 03:00:50,320
Like he was like, I, I tried playing it for 30 seconds and I'm like, I don't get the joke.

3550
03:00:50,320 --> 03:00:51,520
This is a stupid game.

3551
03:00:51,520 --> 03:00:52,400
Close window.

3552
03:00:52,400 --> 03:00:55,760
But then he was telling me about it on vent and I was like laughing because it sounded

3553
03:00:55,760 --> 03:00:56,720
really ridiculous.

3554
03:00:56,720 --> 03:01:00,720
So if he's not listening, I'll get the link from him and we can talk about it next week

3555
03:01:00,720 --> 03:01:03,680
because Loki, I think you of all of us should probably play this game.

3556
03:01:03,680 --> 03:01:04,480
It sounds like something you'd get.

3557
03:01:04,480 --> 03:01:05,440
Sounds awesome.

3558
03:01:05,440 --> 03:01:06,960
You like flash games that are weird.

3559
03:01:07,600 --> 03:01:08,320
All right.

3560
03:01:08,320 --> 03:01:09,920
Um, okay.

3561
03:01:09,920 --> 03:01:11,680
Let's go around to get everybody's final thought.

3562
03:01:11,680 --> 03:01:14,000
Jamie, you had something in mind already, so I'll start with you tonight.

3563
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:14,560
Your final thought.

3564
03:01:14,560 --> 03:01:15,360
I'm going to wreck it.

3565
03:01:17,600 --> 03:01:20,320
My final thought tonight is baked potato.

3566
03:01:21,040 --> 03:01:22,400
Loki, your final thought tonight?

3567
03:01:22,400 --> 03:01:24,480
Um, mob arena.

3568
03:01:24,480 --> 03:01:29,440
Hopefully they'll be coming soon and otherwise check out the map that we have for the vog

3569
03:01:29,440 --> 03:01:29,760
server.

3570
03:01:29,760 --> 03:01:31,520
If you're not part of it, you should join.

3571
03:01:32,480 --> 03:01:38,480
It's fun and you get to build stuff, but if you want to check out the map, vogmc.co.cc

3572
03:01:38,480 --> 03:01:40,080
and you can check out what we're building.

3573
03:01:40,720 --> 03:01:41,120
Peek in.

3574
03:01:42,480 --> 03:01:44,720
That's going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio.

3575
03:01:44,720 --> 03:01:48,000
Thank you guys so much for downloading our show or listening to us live.

3576
03:01:48,000 --> 03:01:50,400
However you choose to participate with orange launch radio.

3577
03:01:50,400 --> 03:01:51,440
We really appreciate it.

3578
03:01:51,520 --> 03:01:54,000
You know, we've said this a lot, but it is true.

3579
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:55,440
We're an independent show.

3580
03:01:55,440 --> 03:01:57,040
We don't ask for anything.

3581
03:01:57,040 --> 03:01:59,120
Please just tell a friend or two.

3582
03:01:59,120 --> 03:02:00,080
I guess this is something.

3583
03:02:00,080 --> 03:02:04,000
I mean, we don't ask for money and stuff, but, uh, I like money that you can just give

3584
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:04,640
it to me.

3585
03:02:04,640 --> 03:02:07,920
A tell a friend or two or five about the show.

3586
03:02:07,920 --> 03:02:09,360
Help spread the word.

3587
03:02:09,360 --> 03:02:11,520
The voting in the podcast towards we talked about earlier.

3588
03:02:11,520 --> 03:02:15,040
That's a great way to do that, but you know, there's other ways to spread the word to

3589
03:02:15,040 --> 03:02:16,000
tell a friend.

3590
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:17,600
Give us a nice review somewhere.

3591
03:02:17,600 --> 03:02:19,280
Help spread the word of orange launch radio.
