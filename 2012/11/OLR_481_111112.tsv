14047	26316	Tonight, November 11th, 2012, Nintendo reveals some more details about the Wii U, THQ delays games as stocks fall, and could the Kinect soon police your content licenses?
31616	36777	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36877	43919	It is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 481 for this November the 11th of 2012.
45420	55262	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and all that good stuff with my co-host first off the one the only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
55322	55582	Hi.
55942	56883	How are you Jamie Summers?
57483	58423	Um I'm okay.
58743	60464	You're knitting rainbow things over here.
60665	63707	I'm crocheting the gayest scarf ever.
64047	67810	All it needs is KY Jelly and it'll be gayer.
67931	70873	Are you planning in advance of Gay Pride Month?
70913	72775	Are you planning to sell these?
73015	78719	This is actually a scheme that I've had for a while and I thought was kind of a different bit of yarn.
78739	79500	And I'll put a picture up.
80161	84104	But I've been taking orders for scrap scarves.
84544	86406	Basically, I'm working through all of my old cheap yarn.
87026	88747	And this was actually fairly cheap skein.
88787	91088	I just didn't realize that it was going to crochet up so pretty.
91729	100334	So I'm actually going to go back and buy more of them to make people scarves and things for various pride events and whatnot.
100534	103716	Or like the holidays, because, you know, everybody likes a homemade holiday gift.
104016	104236	I do.
104276	109960	Well, that's actually why I texted you a while back and asked if you or Alan were allergic to wool.
110140	110580	Yay.
111681	111981	Awesome.
112641	113002	I'm broke.
113322	118225	We'll also say hello to somebody that I'm sure is making lots of homemade gifts for the holiday, Tech Master Loki.
118245	120287	No, I'm not.
121728	124490	You're not going to bake cookies for everybody for the holidays?
124730	126291	No, I don't do much baking.
126532	128533	Let's order some cookies from Colorado.
130174	130454	Right?
131595	132676	How have you been doing, Loki?
132916	135518	Oh, fantastic, with my car not working and everything.
135939	137240	Oh, yeah, sorry to hear about that.
137600	139201	Yeah, that's a Ford we expected.
139745	140866	Fix or Repair Daily, right?
140886	141026	Yeah.
141286	141546	All right.
142127	144328	Well, it's not just the three of us on the show every week.
144388	146729	It's you guys joining us live in our chat room.
147029	150772	If you want to join us in the chat room, head on over to live.vognetwork.com.
150792	163219	And if you're listening on the podcast feed, just a reminder, we do tape live every Sunday night at about 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at The Voice of Geeks Network or vognetwork.com.
163579	166461	And again, our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.
166761	169363	You know, there is another thing that Ford can stand for.
169543	169763	What?
169943	170724	Found on Road Dead.
170944	171864	Yeah, I've heard that one too.
172385	173165	From Parking Lot.
174206	175086	But it doesn't work.
175346	177007	Yeah.
177488	177768	All right.
178668	185333	So we're going to get into some news and what we've been playing this week and some big interviews tonight that I will talk about in just a moment.
185973	186974	But I do want to start off the show.
187054	190716	First, because we have some interviews tonight, I know we might have a few new listeners because of that.
191056	191857	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network,
217791	219192	Pretty aggressively here in the South.
219232	221893	I don't know what other words you'd use to describe it.
221933	223234	We were angry DDR players.
223334	223754	Rah!
224374	225615	Damn these arrows, damn them.
225935	231317	And birthday parties at Roseville Golf Land where we sat on the floor in front of the fourth mix and ate cake.
232638	233438	That was my birthday.
233618	239341	I still remember one of the first dream games we ever had on Orange Launch Radio was inspired by Golf Land trips.
239381	242763	You called it, what was it, Birthday Party Sniper or something like that?
242803	243083	Yeah.
243943	246686	Yeah, Roseville Golf Land is an interesting place.
246746	247467	It still is today.
247607	249048	Interesting is a good word to describe it.
249689	251230	Like people who pick their nose and eat it.
251390	251951	It's interesting.
252431	255795	I went like not too long ago and like wore myself out by DDR.
255855	257376	I was like, I got old.
257396	258938	I know, right?
259358	263901	But anyway, so 10 years ago we all met playing DDR and, you know, we were really into that scene.
263921	266283	And it wasn't just DDR.
266323	268624	It was, you know, a lot of the imports coming from Japan.
268664	271206	We used to have the Bomani parties here locally.
271446	277150	The Sacramentals having the Bomani parties where we'd bust out the Beatmania 5 key and the Beatmania 2DX.
277210	280152	I remember I couldn't get that name because a Catholic organization took it.
280552	280893	Really?
281073	281353	Yeah.
282017	282477	DarkSakura, Loki,
300962	302903	initial D or something like that.
302963	313610	We used to go to a little restaurant that was in the parking lot and we just kind of sit around, order things that were bad for us like mozzarella sticks and just talk some shit about video games and what was going on.
313850	328839	And so that was really the type of thing we wanted to bring here to the internets is this giant virtual table where we're all sitting on one side of it here in the studio talking our stuff and then you guys kind of make up the rest of that table sitting here with us in the chat room and via the Skype line and so forth.
329139	334506	Just talking some good stuff about video games and just having fun with it because that's what video games are all about, fun.
334906	336649	Talking smack about stupid people.
337590	342336	DDR and that whole thing and Beatmania, Bomani in general, music games was really all about community.
342736	347803	So segueing a little bit into one of the interviews we're going to have tonight is with our buddy Eddie.
348303	348984	DDR Freak DDR Freak
368098	372641	He probably has the largest music game community that's out there.
372701	380045	So I want to talk to him just kind of about the past, the future, and so forth, and have some fun commentary with him on that.
380365	382587	So we'll be talking to him in about 15 minutes or so.
383127	384008	GirlGamerVogue.com
404266	405807	and GGVogue.com.
428842	447793	and you know over these 10 years that we've been doing the show we have a lot of the same people that show up in our chat room week after week and they like to hear the little insights that are going on in our personal lives both the good and the bad and I have to share something with you guys tonight that you know kind of happened I just want to get off my chest because the weird thing about this is
448493	455857	and I'm going to apologize to Jamie in advance for this because a lot of this is very deja vu to a story that she told not even three weeks ago on the show.
455878	456478	Perfectly okay.
456538	457759	Just forgive me if I get sniffy.
457859	458299	It's fine.
458999	460280	The whole thing's just weird.
461541	464743	So you guys can probably guess where I'm going with this if I'm referencing that.
466464	472868	As many of you know, I moved in with my boyfriend Alan about, gosh, it was probably about almost two years ago now.
474509	476370	And we, actually more like a year and a half.
476430	482694	But anyway, he brought with him two cats that he's had for a long time since 2000, I think.
482834	486836	I think he got them around October of 2000 and they were about four or six months old at the time.
487136	489418	Probably fudging some of these details, but I wasn't around back then.
490839	509192	and their names are Maruko and Sanrio and Maruko was a male black cat and Sanrio's a tan cat female and you know I've grown very close to these cats as well and you've probably heard them referenced on the show sometimes in fact it was really weird just the other day I was listening to a playback yes I do listen to OLR once in a
512994	513115	Yeah.
513155	513255	Yeah.
536563	540326	Maruko always pranced around with his tail in the air, so I always called him Mr. Priss.
541367	547511	But he was also very vocal and was a really fun cat, and I really have grown to appreciate Maruko.
547811	549313	And he loves Sanrio's food.
550513	550894	No doubt.
551374	553335	You can sadly guess where this is going.
553895	556296	We got blindsided a little bit the past couple days.
556716	560697	Maruko started showing some really bad symptoms on Thursday and Friday.
561857	563718	He just wasn't himself.
563878	565538	I can't even describe it.
565959	567139	His meows were different.
567199	571080	He was always a very vocal cat, and the way he was breathing was very different as well.
571140	573721	So I told Alan, well, of course, let's go see the vet right away.
574361	602371	and you know we go into the vet's office pretty much thinking oh you know we just need to get some medication he'll be all right whatever but we get the x-rays back and the news is is really bad he had a lot of fluid um in his body in places it shouldn't be um basically so much around his lung that it was basically um pushing on his lung and he was having a hard time breathing that was causing it so um unfortunately um you know a tough decision had to be made and we um we put him down yesterday and it was um
604195	605015	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
624122	643512	The veterinarian made it pretty clear that it's probably heart failure, it's probably cancer, or it's this, what is it, FIP, that extremely deadly cat virus that goes around where if you get a cat that has that, I have another friend, this has been a terrible year for kittens, I have another friend that just lost a cat to FIP not that long ago.
643972	647454	So it's just like, it's tough, it's tough.
648614	663219	with with Shermie she was wheezing when we got back from Disneyland and then I wrapped her up in hot towels for a few days and she perked right back up and then suddenly she just keeled over but the symptoms sound very similar she was having respiratory issues
664490	669392	Since some folks in the chat room are asking at live.vognetwork.com, the Maruko was 12 and a half.
670192	671852	So, you know, a little old in kitty years.
672512	679835	For an indoor cat, maybe not super old, but definitely, you know, old enough for complications to start coming in.
680395	682375	So, you know, I don't know what else to say.
682415	683616	I just want to get that off my chest.
683836	688257	So that way, if I'm going to sniffle up, I want to do that now and not while we're trying to interview somebody.
688937	690118	Hi Eddie, how are you?
690458	691559	He was a very good kitty.
691699	692560	He was, he was.
692720	694401	And he sat in my lap a couple times.
694881	695902	Well, you used to cat sit.
696322	699044	So I know you were one of the first people I called in the parking lot.
699225	701266	And I was like, I'm driving.
701386	702687	I'm like, pull over.
702887	707931	I was actually literally, this was at what Florin Mall used to be, if you want to know where I was.
708851	725160	and I was half in the thing to pull out into the street when you called and I was trying to be considerate I'm driving and I was like okay fine and then it went on to FaceTime I was like oh shit have I been on FaceTime this entire time and turn around and pull in and I had my friend with me and then I just did a circle in the parking lot yeah so
726281	728463	Anyway, I want to try and move on.
728483	735390	I don't want to dwell on this too much, but I do want to address some of the comments that are in chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
735430	737372	Lots of condolences, and thank you very much.
737472	739575	I will pass those along to Alan as well.
739655	744900	I was only fortunate enough to know Maruko for about three years, but he did live for 12 and a half years.
745600	746961	TigerClaw says, my condolences.
747001	749202	Losing a pet is the hardest thing a person could ever go through.
749382	750922	It is definitely one of the worst.
751682	753503	TigerClaw asks, how about Sanrio?
753543	754603	How is she health-wise?
755704	764367	Obviously, the plan is when we have money, because yesterday set us back a little bit, but when we have some money, we do want to go in and get her checked and make sure she didn't contract the same virus.
764387	766188	That's one of the first things we want to try and rule out.
767728	768468	She's doing okay.
769589	770809	She's hard to read right now.
771390	772690	I think she knows something's up.
773251	775972	She's kind of looking around, acting a little differently.
776172	777693	I think she knows that something's missing.
778913	780494	But, you know, that's to be expected.
780594	782555	But she still has some of her playfulness.
783075	785736	I took a really cute video earlier today of her playing with a string.
786257	789138	So, you know, we'll see.
789758	795061	We'll try to get her in as soon as we can when we can financially take care of it.
796742	798263	I'm going to some other comments in our chat room.
798723	799724	I like this from Breakman.
799764	800405	It's very good.
801225	806189	Cats and dogs are such a great part of our life, but they are so fragile and their time with us is far too short.
806289	807070	Ain't that the truth?
807570	808751	That is very much the truth.
809592	811293	GameGroove says, I'm sorry about your cat.
811353	813255	I've lost my last cat a few months ago.
814015	820298	It's tough, and especially the suddenness of it all and so forth is tough.
820379	825141	But anyway, I want to move on because how do we escape from reality?
825221	826882	By playing video games, right?
827162	828163	Well, not in my case.
828263	830324	I drank and cried for a night.
831004	831284	Mass Effect 3
858826	860587	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
886045	889347	So I was quite happily surprised.
890427	894589	And I even checked it, you know, with other people.
894889	904013	I, you know, did a bunch of other stuff to make sure it wasn't just a, you know, what's the word I'm thinking of?
906634	909315	Not a whim, but just a one-off thing.
909335	909595	Mm-hmm.
910263	934098	and it kept working and so I was like everyone get a multiplayer right now so I played for a while with Shane and Tim and then I played again with Shane and Tim and Spike the other day and with my friend George and everything was fine I still kind of suck at it but I'm getting better and got a few levels in did the N7 challenge thing and
934958	935258	Fun!
935538	936219	So you got a banner.
936759	937540	Yeah, I have.
937880	939381	And I wore my N7 shirt that day.
940601	947425	And I also went in just to see if it was like a completely new patch, so I tried to hack my game again.
948186	951468	And, well, more like hex-edited it so that I could get the console to unlock.
952048	954990	And it's at the same sector, it still works, so...
955530	964457	But everyone, if you're trying to do the hex edit based on what's on the Mass Effect wiki, it's not F4 for the last two numbers, it's F3.
964777	965557	Just letting you know.
967058	968279	I did that on... Don't screw that up.
968599	970201	No, I did it on... Because there's no F4.
971121	974324	I did the F3 on a win because I found the same sector, and it worked.
974544	976525	So, they have it on their wrong.
977446	983050	So, as I just said, Tiger Claw, you probably didn't hear, but I can play online again.
983770	1009220	and I went back in on my DLC works and so that means I'm good to go for Omega but we're calling it the ghost patch because they didn't announce anything they didn't even acknowledge that there was a problem the only acknowledgement that I got was from some guy in customer service who actually worked with me for a long time and he said yeah we're noticing that there's a problem here we just can't say anything else about it right now
1010581	1012883	Oh, really?
1013944	1014564	No comment?
1014705	1015826	I can't say anything on that?
1016967	1019149	He did more for me than the other people did.
1020350	1027237	But it did give me a nice little 30% off code, which I'm going to use for the Omega DLC.
1029202	1030222	So, very happy.
1031423	1034163	And I'm playing through Mass Effect 2.
1034423	1040805	I actually did touch WoW long enough to log out while I was trying to make plans with you to go see Silent Hill.
1041525	1043486	I completely forgot that I was logged in and talking to you.
1044246	1045586	Did you guys go see Silent Hill?
1045706	1045947	No.
1046147	1047567	No, we still haven't made it out to see it.
1048018	1049880	That's right, I still haven't seen Wreck-It Ralph or something.
1049900	1051141	You need to do that.
1051902	1059288	BlackWolf has a smart-ass comment in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com in response to your fact that the information on the wiki is wrong.
1059328	1062251	He says, if only it was a wiki and everyone could edit it.
1062371	1065394	That means I have to log in for an account on it and I don't fucking feel like it.
1065974	1067476	That means I have to do work.
1067976	1068617	Wah.
1068937	1076364	Well, the other thing, and I think I mentioned it last week, is now that I have a job, like a real job that's going to pay me some good money.
1077305	1077946	Hooray for money.
1078399	1096191	I know that I kind of haven't had much I haven't had a whole bunch of time to really do much except that the good thing about my job is that since I don't usually have to be in until 9 in the morning I can stay up till midnight and sleep in.
1096311	1099473	Who really feels like waking up early in the morning and gaming before work?
1100394	1101014	Seriously?
1102135	1103616	Gaming is something you stay up all night and do.
1103676	1104917	You play games in the morning, Loki?
1105057	1107979	I would if I didn't have to get the baby up.
1108699	1110000	I like to stay up all night.
1110120	1111201	I don't have children.
1111221	1111881	That's awesome.
1113502	1115283	I've stayed up all night and done that still.
1115303	1117104	He's not really a baby anymore either.
1117144	1118144	He's more of a toddler.
1119065	1120466	Just saying.
1120566	1122687	Child.
1122927	1133693	At any rate, my schedule has actually been pretty perfect for gaming except that my work environment is so fast paced and I don't get paid days off which makes me a little sad but it's all good.
1134533	1135234	I love where I work.
1135374	1144858	It's in a small office in a house and I have so much freedom for my scheduling and for things that need to happen and I can wear socks.
1145018	1147439	I ask permission to wear my fuzzy socks in the office and I can do it.
1148239	1148560	It's great.
1148920	1150300	Anyway, so yeah.
1150881	1153742	My work allows me more game time so I will be playing more stuff.
1154662	1154922	Awesome.
1155523	1156483	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1157203	1158544	I played Call of Duty Black Ops 2.
1159064	1160605	Yes, I know it's not out yet but
1162369	1163410	How's that gonna stop me?
1184202	1187723	So, I've been playing mainly the single-player campaign.
1188023	1192424	And really, that's kind of cool because I haven't played a lot of the single-player campaigns.
1192444	1201485	Like, I played a bit of Modern Warfare 3 single-player campaign and totally hated it because they're really penalizing you with, like, shooting your teammates.
1201785	1207166	Not that I'm trying to shoot my teammates, but, like, everyone kind of blends in when it's so chaotic and stuff.
1207526	1209367	And it seems like Black Ops 2 isn't so...
1211107	1215349	Well, I'm playing it on a super easy difficulty too because I just really care about the story.
1215369	1216630	I don't give a shit about the challenge.
1218591	1226455	But I haven't had that problem where, oh, you accidentally killed a teammate because he ran in front of you when you're firing a missile or something like that.
1227315	1231217	The story is fucking awesome.
1231297	1235999	It's really action-packed and I really enjoy it.
1236600	1244103	That's saying a lot considering a lot of times people consider the single-player campaign for these games to be a throwaway.
1244464	1247325	It's just, oh, they have it on there, but it's really all about multiplayer.
1247865	1248146	Actdeft.com
1268186	1275589	The first kind of future warfare one that you're in, you're kind of swinging along this... It's like a mountainside or something like that.
1276369	1280050	And you're tethered to this other guy and you have these nano gloves that you can grip onto the rocks and stuff.
1280130	1285052	And they're scouting out this base that's kind of in a temple or something like that.
1285112	1288394	And so they put on their wingsuits and they fly down there.
1288494	1291055	And just that sequence is so fucking awesome.
1291115	1291435	It's just...
1292435	1293395	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1314602	1316364	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1340623	1342485	I swear to god that was a scene in Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter
1355560	1359262	But it's just, it's so like chaotic and awesome.
1359803	1361423	It's a really, I love it.
1361484	1362264	I love the campaign.
1362324	1366727	It really kind of makes me want to go back and try some of the other single player campaigns of the different games.
1366807	1371870	But just for some reason, this like kind of near future combat stuff is just really cool.
1371930	1374511	Like the storyline is actually, I think, really well done.
1375112	1377013	So definitely worth checking out.
1377133	1381255	I mean, even if you're kind of thinking twice about it, it's just another Modern Warfare shooter game.
1381876	1382656	Check out the storyline.
1382676	1383857	They actually did a pretty good job on it.
1384817	1408725	um so besides that played a little bit more Minecraft been just trying to get you know plugins and stuff to work correctly with each other I'm working on finishing up the mob arena stuff so I have this magic spells um plugin that I added in there but I didn't realize it had a dependent plugin with this vault thing that I had to install in there so I'm still trying to get that all worked out and get the permission set correctly still kind of new to the whole bucket plugin stuff um and then noticed that
1410425	1415470	One of our other users, HitStun, had turned into Mr. Freeze and had frozen the jungles.
1415650	1416931	Everybody chill!
1417772	1418412	Seriously.
1419213	1422496	Wait a second, why can't I see out the roof of this mob arena I created?
1423196	1423837	What's going on here?
1423857	1424818	Is it just not drawing in?
1424878	1426559	I realize it's snow.
1426700	1430943	Leave it to HitStun or somebody to bring the League of Supervillains into the...
1431864	1432765	It was an accident.
1432805	1435247	He was working with WorldEdit.
1435307	1436888	It's always an accident.
1437108	1439170	That's how villains get created.
1439310	1440271	It was easy to fix.
1440411	1442012	Joker fell into that vat.
1442132	1443873	This is what happens when you play God.
1444494	1445555	Two commands and it was fixed.
1445575	1451099	But he's trying to make a... He was making a snow globe in the nether.
1451119	1459786	I don't know how that got out onto everything else, but there's snow in a bunch of the different chunks there, so I had to fix that.
1460386	1460526	But...
1461750	1463310	I thought it was hilarious there was snow in the jungle.
1463670	1465211	Yes, there was snow all over the jungle.
1465271	1466231	I was like, this is not right.
1466311	1467791	So I had to find the corners.
1467971	1469252	Welcome to the jungle.
1469372	1470432	We got lots of snow.
1473072	1473773	So I fixed all that.
1473793	1477373	So I tried playing a little bit of Curiosity, but it wasn't working.
1477553	1478434	So that was that.
1479054	1482554	And Call of Duty Black Ops, or not Black Ops, Modern Warfare 3.
1482734	1485415	We've been playing multiplayer of that, and that's pretty fun.
1485615	1491860	I actually played a little bit of multiplayer in Black Ops 2 as well, the split screen stuff for system, actually just split screen stuff.
1492401	1504912	And because I was bored, I decided to take on nine AI characters that were the veteran difficulty, which is the hardest, and actually beat them because it's AI and you figure out the weaknesses in their pathfinding and away you go.
1505993	1506433	So that was that.
1507168	1508249	I forgot one other game I played.
1508909	1509689	Very Solitaire.
1510430	1511550	That's right, because it was free.
1511670	1512531	I played that too.
1512671	1513811	It was actually fun.
1515132	1516092	For a free game?
1516372	1517173	Better than Yaris.
1517633	1518713	It was a good time killer.
1518954	1520974	I actually had fun with it because I like hard games.
1522055	1523456	It reminded me of Neopets.
1523556	1525777	I wouldn't have minded paying a little bit of money for it.
1525837	1527998	I don't think a lot of money, but it was cute.
1528638	1530619	I used to play Pyramid Solitaire on Neopets all the time.
1530679	1532461	That was a good tip, Actdeft, by the way, last week.
1532521	1538905	Oh, and the last thing, one of the things that they've been hyping up about Black Ops 2 is these whole kind of like strike force missions.
1539365	1540286	They fucking suck.
1540546	1541867	I hate the strike force missions.
1541907	1543988	And the reason why is because they're on the multiplayer maps.
1544068	1549052	It's basically kind of like the strategy thing where you get a bunch of different troops and stuff and you can kind of...
1549572	1551133	Okay, go here, defend this.
1551453	1552554	Go here, attack this.
1552834	1554215	And you can jump into each of them.
1554235	1557557	It's supposed to add this strategy element to it.
1557898	1561120	The problem is, though, is the controlling of that stuff is really terrible.
1561500	1566683	And so you're telling your troops to go here, and then you're trying to select one soldier, and it's selecting all of them.
1566803	1571747	I found it more efficient for me to go into a soldier and just do the mission myself.
1573067	1576930	So that's kind of the only poo-poo thing about Black Ops 2 right now.
1577851	1582396	HaloMan in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, today's headline, Loki loves a game.
1582457	1584739	Tomorrow's headline, the Mayans have been proven to be right.
1585660	1587803	Dude, I love games all the time.
1588623	1590005	Grand Theft Auto, hello.
1590325	1590726	That is true.
1590746	1592227	By the way, Halo 4 made me nauseous.
1592848	1596650	Well, if you're done with your gaming week, I want to quickly talk about mine.
1596710	1603634	I don't have a whole lot of time because we're running a little late for Eddie's interview because we got a late start tonight.
1603694	1607477	But I want to quickly talk about a couple games because I did play some new stuff this week.
1607957	1609758	One of them is Halo 4.
1609898	1611559	Yes, me, Halo.
1611839	1612139	Uh-huh.
1612360	1612800	I bought it.
1613780	1616181	Keep in mind, I've been out of the Halo franchise for a little bit.
1616281	1619102	I didn't buy ODST, I didn't buy Anniversary, I didn't buy Reach.
1619122	1620542	The last Halo game I bought was Halo 3.
1621262	1626484	And I didn't love Halo 3 because I didn't have a lot of friends that were online playing the multiplayer.
1626664	1628664	And for me, that's kind of where it's at in Halo.
1629084	1630785	I don't get into the story mode too much.
1631865	1636126	So Halo 4 is kind of a new boot to the series because it's a new developer.
1636247	1637507	It's 343 Industries.
1638027	1639968	And I did play a little bit of the campaign.
1640008	1641648	I'm only through like the first two chapters.
1641668	1643749	So I'm not going to try to speak with authority or anything.
1644109	1646390	But I will say it's interesting.
1646890	1652732	I feel a little lost because I'm not as familiar with all the backstory and so forth.
1652792	1656973	But I can pick up enough of what's going on that I'm not like hating it.
1657573	1672023	and at the end of the day the story is really about the relationship between Master Chief and Cortana any review outlet that's talked about this game is going to tell you that so I don't think you need to know too much more to really get into the series but for me
1672984	1674845	It's always been multiplayer is where it's at.
1675345	1676265	And I've been having fun.
1676285	1679306	There's a group of about four of us that have been playing multiplayer online.
1679606	1681047	And we've been trying out all the modes.
1681807	1686008	You know, King of the Hill, Oddball, all the stuff you know from the old games.
1686108	1686848	Of course, Slayer.
1687809	1689989	But there's a couple fun new ones.
1690029	1694751	And I gotta say, I had a great time playing Flood, which is one of the new game modes.
1695391	1697052	and DarkSakura.com
1720703	1721283	Thanks for watching!
1737808	1739510	For a good time, just add Flood.
1739950	1741671	And then there was this other mode we played.
1741691	1743493	I think it was like Gryffin Ball or something like that.
1743573	1744073	Gryff Ball.
1744193	1744734	Gryff Ball.
1744834	1747476	And it said in the – like all the other ones have description.
1747776	1752580	And for Gryff Ball, it said just add Awesome or prepare for Awesome or something like that.
1753241	1756724	So we go in this mode and all it is is you have the gigantic –
1757304	1758445	Gravity Hammers.
1759086	1760867	You can either have a hammer or a sword.
1761007	1763970	And it's just a game of get the ball into the goal.
1763990	1769275	But you have these giant hammers that you're either knocking the ball around with or the other players.
1770592	1774655	And so that shit was really funny, actually, even though we got beat bad.
1775095	1781119	Like it was Shane and I versus Spike from Game Buoy Podcast and Tim.
1781720	1783361	It was two on two.
1784522	1787064	They wiped the floor with us, like five points to nothing.
1787124	1788284	It was depressing.
1788885	1789745	But yeah, that was...
1790566	1791247	Thank you for watching!
1808800	1812523	I'm sure the story mode's great too.
1813224	1818209	Everybody says great things about it on the internet, but I'm not as into the lore and all that stuff, so I'm like, okay, yeah.
1818549	1819830	The presentation's really good.
1820290	1823774	There's a pretty cool scene in the beginning where you're climbing up a wall, and it's kind of neat.
1825415	1828878	The other game I want to talk quickly about, LittleBigPlanet Karting, I picked up on the PlayStation 3.
1829238	1832521	I haven't played a lot of it because I've been too busy with multiplayer on Halo 4, but...
1834563	1835063	I like it.
1835283	1847946	It really does feel like a fusion of Mod Nation Racers and LittleBigPlanet, which is to obviously no one's surprise because it's the same developers of Mod Nation Racers with all the LittleBigPlanet stuff in it.
1848306	1849346	It controls great.
1849726	1850307	It's fun.
1850987	1853707	I noticed there weren't a lot of people online to race against.
1853747	1854828	I'm not sure what's up with that.
1855248	1858048	Maybe because the game's so new and everybody's distracted with Halo 4.
1858108	1859489	I was just on at a weird time.
1860009	1860949	But yeah, so...
1861349	1867395	So far, I'm liking LittleBigPlanet karting, but I need more time with it to give you my full opinions.
1868196	1871779	The other games I'll talk about real quick, Curiosity, What's in the Cube?
1872279	1874882	I don't think that's really a game, and we shouldn't call it a game.
1874922	1876704	It's just a weird thing.
1877384	1884371	They're having those server problems left and right, which is really unfortunate, but I like the zen-ness of being able to just sit there and
1887148	1894250	And kind of figure out the way to get huge combos of coins and so forth I was able to get enough coins So what do you do with the coins?
1894610	1914816	You can buy items that will let you break bricks faster See, that was the thing, the shop wouldn't even open up for me Because it was so lagged out I got this pick that let you do 3x3 bricks when you would tap And you can rack up your combos so much faster when you do that And doing the little random tappings are much more fruitful when you do that So, kind of neat
1915536	1923823	Um, but anyway, Curiosity, not really a game, and they're having a lot of server problems, but it's free, better than Yaris, a little bit.
1925284	1938094	Uh, the one other thing I want to talk about, since we are about to have a Bomani-centric interview here in a minute, ReflectBeat is out on the iOS systems now, and you can get that on iPad or iPhone, and I've been playing a little bit of ReflectBeat on the iPad.
1938615	1942778	I did not know much about this game, honestly, I've been out of the loop of a lot of the Bomani stuff, but
1943038	1968660	so you know again it's free you only get three songs because they're trying to sell you the song packs that's where they're making the money but it was different I want to try some like verses and try to like play against somebody because I think that would be where the game would because there's more of a versus element to it where if you hit certain notes they'll actually bounce back to the other side and the other player has to hit them so that's kind of neat that was kind of fun a little different
1969420	1976064	Anyhow, we are going to, I'm running a little late here, so I want to get this in here, an interview.
1977205	1986410	And I'm so happy to welcome to the show, Eddie from BamaniStyle.com, a long-running website about music gaming and music game culture.
1986730	1991273	I want to bring him on the line, talk to him about what's going on in the music game world.
1991333	1992074	Hey, Eddie, you there?
1992094	1993394	Yeah, can you hear me?
1993555	1994555	Yeah, we can hear you just fine.
1994575	1995095	How you doing, Eddie?
1995636	1996316	I'm doing all right.
1996756	1997937	Thank you so much for coming on the show.
1997957	1999178	It only took about 10 years, right?
2000231	2000852	Just about, yeah.
2010626	2011646	Thanks, I appreciate it.
2012166	2015367	Alright, well, let's just start with some questions.
2015427	2023309	If you guys have questions for Eddie, I know we probably have some of the Bomani-style community listening tonight, and I know we have some long-time fans of music gaming listening tonight.
2023649	2028870	If you want to ask a question at live.vognetwork.com, just pop into the chat room and ask away.
2028910	2031411	We'll read some of the questions here a little later.
2031911	2032611	Yes, DarkSakura?
2032731	2035132	What is the airspeed velocity of an Aladdin swallow?
2035192	2035412	No, no.
2036012	2037652	You have to ask him on top of things.
2038153	2039113	Not a six-hour show.
2040245	2042366	So, Eddie, tell us a little bit about your website.
2042446	2046046	Tell us about where BomaniStyle.com came from.
2046186	2046827	How did it start?
2048907	2053808	Funny enough, it actually started kind of as a result of DDR Spot.
2053968	2058589	I don't know if you guys remember that site or not, but some of the old NorCal players started that up years ago.
2058609	2061950	It was kind of like a competitor to DDR Freak.
2063971	2068172	Mike Ngo was in Michigan for a tournament way back in 2001.
2069856	2082028	and we ran into each other and got to talking and at the time it was like me, him, the owner of TeamGuilo.net which was a Canadian site and a friend of mine from the New England area named Malcolm.
2082048	2088634	We were all talking about making this just gigantic site to cover all music games because as it had standed like only...
2090103	2091304	DDR was being talked about.
2091484	2098069	Everyone was kind of ignoring the other games and that wasn't really what I was jiving with personally because I like the 5-key stuff a lot.
2099130	2105154	There was a lot of ego that got in the way from the other two sites and nothing bad.
2105194	2119325	It wasn't like we were fighting or anything but there were a lot of arguments about the name and everything so Malcolm and I just kind of splintered off and decided to start Bimani style on our own and it was an early effort by me, him, some guys from the Midwest and
2119983	2125906	A handful of people we knew in Japan to just get more word out about the other series that people weren't playing at the time.
2126626	2136151	You've been very successful at BomaniStyle.com because it's really evolved into a place now where I know for a while you were doing some type of record distribution or record stuff, right?
2136691	2137932	I'm still doing that actually.
2139033	2140693	It was kind of like a weird situation.
2142361	2144222	I did Slake's CD in the U.S.
2145283	2146144	back in 2006.
2147245	2154030	And a year later, we got in touch with DJ Chucky and the guys from Groovy about bringing them out to the U.S.
2154090	2155190	to play at Anime Central.
2155831	2160774	And that kind of spiraled into us distributing their albums in North America.
2161575	2163857	More Japanese hardcore stuff, not Bimani-centric.
2163897	2166298	But ever since we did that, we've had...
2167728	2187562	you know M Project, DJ Chucky, No Chin, Groovy, Chorus K, Red Alice, Jackazid just a number of people have been featured in all these music games out to Chicago for the Anime Central show that we do every year so that's kind of like where that project is we're actually right now in the planning stages for our 2013 show so it's still going on
2187998	2188339	Awesome.
2188379	2190601	So that's kind of the place to be is Anime Central.
2190641	2198049	If you want to see some of these artists that kind of started in music games, I guess, or I guess maybe known over here from that or whatever you want to say.
2199390	2200992	Yeah, that's pretty much it.
2201312	2203094	What do you think has kept Bomani style?
2203114	2209601	I mean, you know, we just saw DDR Freak, you know, you kind of mentioned that Bomani style kind of started as a, it was meant to be
2210101	2213243	somewhat like DDR Freak but more inclusive of the other music games.
2213323	2216385	Well, obviously DDR Spot and they shut down a long time ago.
2216745	2222089	DDR Freak just recently in the past year finally sunsetted and said, you know, party's over.
2223190	2231615	How do you think Bomani Style, what's kept Bomani Style above that and alive in light of these other sites sunsetting?
2232014	2238857	Well, I mean, you know, one thing when it comes to running a website, ultimately, if it closes, that's the decision of the person who owns the website.
2239037	2251642	And quite frankly, you know, my feelings on it are even when I have my low points, which, you know, got us talking what a week ago, a Facebook post that I made about how the community has been lately.
2252543	2266723	even when I've had my low points I just look at it as though I've been doing this site for 10 years how can you just walk away from something like that especially when people are still using it so I think it's just there's a genuine interest from a lot of people who are really diehard fans for that information on
2267544	2270125	The more global games, stuff that's not released over here.
2270165	2277508	And then at the same time, there are people who are more casual that are into maybe just the music and they like knowing when new songs are coming out.
2277548	2278328	They don't play the games.
2278348	2279348	They just want to know about the music.
2279388	2284890	I think it's a variety of things, but the community's kind of stuck with us and I'm just really not ready to let it go.
2285110	2287431	So I'm just sticking with it as long as I can.
2288851	2294075	Since you brought up Facebook and all that, where is the community at these days, you think?
2294195	2295816	What is the music game community?
2295996	2296477	It's split.
2296537	2304142	It's kind of weird because you kind of have splinter groups now in regards to what games people are playing and what mentalities everybody has.
2305883	2310666	Konami has not really been doing a lot to help the community over here in the U.S.
2310946	2312207	They never really have.
2312447	2314529	There have been attempts in the past, you know.
2315029	2320576	with Beatmania and the home version DDRs that came out early on and DDR continuing on for years.
2320656	2324541	But ultimately, you know, the hardcore fans kind of
2325663	2327105	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2345785	2346226	DarkSakura,
2362958	2371341	On the outside, it looks as though the community has just degenerated to this massive negativity, this massive group of negativity.
2371401	2376642	They're just tired of not getting any of the games and being ignored and so on and so forth.
2377042	2385185	So you run into situations like what's happening right now with the DJ Max community, who, for the most part, ever since Technica came out, have just been...
2385765	2386286	Thanks for watching!
2395310	2422578	everyone starts complaining or starts just outright talking shit about the company that makes the game not really looking at it from their perspective but saying like hey this is what I want why aren't you doing what I want you to do and so that tends to stand out over the people who are a little bit more positive and understanding about everything so from the outside looking in I think the music game community kind of comes off as though it's not very welcoming as of late and I've had my criticisms over
2423311	2426814	and just the general attitudes of people for a long time.
2426854	2436083	But I think there's still just a ton of love for the games and the hardcore players are a little bit more vocal about what they expect than the people who play them a little bit more casually.
2437704	2452795	Since you were talking about Konami and the difficult position they've been in for many years and so forth, although I don't know, I kind of think that all the United States progress for DDR, anything they had going for it, kind of went away when Redmond and Hawaii both went away.
2452855	2455177	I mean, that was pretty much the end of that, right?
2455917	2458059	I wouldn't necessarily say that.
2458099	2458639	I think that...
2459864	2461305	from a player expectation.
2461405	2463466	A lot of that went away because they lost that connection.
2463506	2471390	I mean, when they were doing the games in Redmond, especially, I mean, the guys working on the games were fans of DDR.
2471650	2474331	A lot of them were really old school NorCal and SoCal players.
2475092	2478453	So that connection to the community definitely went away.
2478473	2479854	And I think that caused a lot of problems.
2482330	2484610	I don't think that the momentum went away, so to speak.
2484771	2492072	I think the momentum went away when Konami wasn't really being as hands-on with certain projects as they used to be.
2492552	2495493	So you'd see things like the Wii games coming out.
2495593	2497233	I think were a fantastic effort.
2497293	2498613	I think they did a really good job with those.
2499053	2502174	The Xbox and the PS3 versions were kind of whatever.
2502234	2503714	The song lists weren't fantastic.
2503754	2505694	But I mean, they were still very traditional DDR games.
2505714	2507255	So then you look at the arcade side of things.
2509927	2524280	After not ever making an attempt in North America with the arcade releases before Xtreme, I mean, there was the original DDR 1.5 in the US, and then there was DDR USA, but honestly, neither of them were really valiant efforts on their behalf.
2525381	2529985	They kind of ignored everything for a long time, and then the In The Groove thing happened, and there was a lot of just...
2531587	2532669	and I personally think were great and uh
2543550	2547511	Those two, like those two games in particular, I think were a really good effort on their behalf.
2547851	2556394	But then X and X2 came out and it was just letting the wrong people handle the franchise, handle the development of these cabinets and do the release and everything.
2556474	2559235	So we got kind of like a shoddy product.
2559455	2561096	I mean, not even kind of a shoddy product.
2561156	2562376	It was really a shoddy product.
2563236	2566697	And a lot of people just kind of got fed up with it and walked away from it.
2566998	2571099	And I mean, I want to clear this up too in regards to the arcade stuff because I know a lot of people bring this up, but
2572310	2601951	DDRX2 kind of had the same problems as DDRX1 did where they were lowering the cost of production on the games and you could tell that the quality went down a lot especially in the dance pads and they made a conscious effort to try to fix the problems from X to X2 because myself and some friends of mine were brought in to consult with them specifically on the arcade release to make sure certain things were up to snuff and when we had seen them everything was functioning perfectly fine and
2602463	2607965	and Timing was fantastic and the games were actually really good quality and X2 as a mix is like one of my favorites in a long time.
2608445	2621770	And then somewhere between when we did our testing work with them and the actual release, something changed and the final product that we got just ended up being this shoddy mess that constantly ends up in a state of disrepair and is almost unplayable.
2623224	2636934	Let me go to the chat, because there's quite a few comments going on in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com First off, Shane Alenko is saying, we worked at Redwood City, not Redmond Oops, my bad, sorry, I was thinking of the wrong video game company, apparently My bad, my bad Mass effect on the brain?
2637034	2646201	Apparently, apparently Let's see, YYR saying, I still believe that Supernova happened because In The Groove happened And a few folks agreeing with him, what do you think?
2648043	2649925	I don't think that that's the case at all, actually.
2650326	2659117	A lot of people look at that because of the timing of the whole thing, but a lot of people also don't remember what it was like when Extreme came out.
2659678	2662642	And when Extreme was in testing, they had always been saying that
2662882	2663523	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2686758	2694303	In between the period of time from Extreme to Supernova, they had released Dancing Stage Fusion in the UK, which used kind of like the middleware hardware.
2695063	2703768	It was the same hardware that Poppin' Music used, so it was a PS2-based hardware, and it didn't use Magic Gate protection, but it was still pretty uncrackable.
2704455	2714761	and finally they settled on the hardware that was used which was basically a PS2 in a box with an IO board that plugged into everything and had its issues with hard drives dying and all that other crap.
2714781	2720605	But I think a lot of the delay had more to do with them just trying to get a lockdown on the issues with all the bootlegging.
2722027	2735541	Since we're talking about reboots and all this stuff and where DDR is heading, this news came up very recently, even after I asked you to come on the show originally, that is that there is this Dance Dance Revolution reboot that's location testing in Japan right now.
2736462	2737203	What do you think about this?
2737283	2738624	Good idea for the series?
2739004	2739745	Bad idea?
2740286	2741066	Not going to go anywhere?
2741086	2741507	What do you think?
2741800	2742040	DJ Ranma S,
2762401	2771452	Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania are getting reset as Guitadora, which is basically just like the XG games in a shiny white cabinet and no second player guitar on the Guitar Freaks version.
2771612	2775356	Are you saying that everything's going the way of Apple, where now it's the new DDR?
2776798	2782164	Well, I think that's what people are going to end up calling it, DDR 2013, which is what people are calling it right now.
2782285	2782445	But
2783265	2793289	I think that what they're doing is they're actually kind of going the Rock Band model with everything and they're setting it up to be a platform as opposed to being something that you get yearly upgrades on.
2793689	2811035	They have a new pricing model for the arcades in Japan that they just rolled out with the newest Beatmania where the arcades pay a subsidized rate for the hardware and the game itself and then Konami kind of forces a profit share on the game through their Pacelli and e-amusement networks so every month the arcades
2811295	2811575	and so on.
2828962	2835406	Every six months or so, they're going to push out another 30 or 40 songs and a UI update and possibly new features and stuff.
2835726	2847933	So I think that this is less of a reboot and more of a way to restructure the way they do things based on how the arcade market has been declining everywhere in the world.
2848234	2855258	It's a conscious effort to try to do something that arcade operators can work with but doesn't leave them in the hole at the end of the day.
2856810	2858851	So this is like the 11th Doctor of DVR.
2859431	2860012	Kind of, sort of.
2860532	2865934	It just sounds like they're forcing them basically to buy and upgrade each year because it's being subsidized throughout the entire year.
2866275	2883543	And with the good faith that they're actually going to put out 30 to 40 songs or whatever for the next update, which, let's be honest, compared to what I've seen with the home releases and what they support DLC-wise, I'll be interested to see if they actually continue on with that after at least one update.
2884825	2886968	Honestly, though, I don't think that that's going to be the case.
2886988	2894661	I don't think the CS games are at all indicative of what they're doing with the arcade stuff because they've been doing download content on the arcade games for a few versions now.
2894681	2895101	2DX18 had
2897173	2897693	and DarkSakura.
2923593	2949325	if people are continuing to play the games then the operators are going to stick with the service and they're going to stay subscribed to the amusement network and everything so it doesn't really benefit Konami at all to not stick with it and at the same time it costs them way less in development to do something like this than it would for them to crank out a new game every 8 to 12 months like they've done for the past 10 years of the series existence How does something like that work though for importers over in the US?
2950545	2952366	It's kind of left to be unsaid right now I mean
2953156	2955797	They haven't been making any of the games really available for a while.
2955917	2961018	DDR was available, but it was available on such sketchy, you know, circumstances.
2961218	2972481	You had to buy, for X and X2, you had to buy a new machine from Betson, and then there were these crap machines that would break down, so you'd end up spending more money in repairing the game than you would make back, and you would never pay off the machine.
2972541	2974021	That happened to a lot of arcades out here.
2974621	2981723	In regards to 2DX and Poppin' Music and Guitar Freaks and Drummania and, you know, like Ubeat and Reflectbeat don't even really exist over here outside of, like,
2982540	2984622	three locations.
2984682	2986703	One of them isn't even an arcade that have a UB machine.
2988465	2995310	They've never been available out here as upgrade kits because historically there just wasn't a lot of interest from the arcade operators for it.
2995350	3001675	Like even when they did the location tests for 2DX14 and they did the UB location tests down here in Southern California.
3001795	3005377	So for importers, it really has...
3007273	3008354	Thank you for watching!
3024164	3025585	I don't think it's really going to affect them at all.
3044946	3045446	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3069309	3098979	they've been shopping the games around a few arcade distributors out here nothing's set in stone or anything like that but ever since they dropped Betson as their lead distributor they have been making attempts to try to find someone else out here to handle the stuff so it's really just kind of hard to say where it's going to go at this point it's the state of the arcade industry in North America that nobody wants to take risks on anything that's going to cost money and I think that that might end up hurting it more than Konami's unwillingness to release anything
3099099	3099880	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3117493	3120916	Think back to 10 years ago when DDR first started getting popular in the US.
3121156	3126700	Arcades had been dead since Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter II.
3127341	3128281	I see it as a cycle.
3128341	3130223	I see the whole arcade industry as a cycle.
3130663	3135206	Not to deviate too much from the conversation, but a lot of the operators are old.
3139665	3140265	Older guys.
3140305	3146189	There's a handful of younger guys who have been starting up their own places, but a lot of arcade operators are older guys that just don't want to take risks on stuff anymore.
3146569	3147989	So redemption kind of rules.
3148110	3151471	That's the king of the arcade space right now because that's what's making money.
3151832	3156254	But there's a lot of laws that have been brought to light.
3156414	3160236	They're not actually laws, but there's a lot of laws that are being proposed right now to kind of
3160734	3163855	Kill the Redemption Market because it's essentially gambling for children.
3176801	3194371	I think that the arcade industry as a whole missed its entire mark with that movie I think that that would have been a perfect chance for them to maybe appeal to Disney to do some more cross promotion and get people out to their locations and bring some life back to the arcades again and nobody capitalized that at all there's always a DVD release
3195134	3197695	Yeah, but you know, it's still going to be limited at that point.
3197735	3199735	I think it's better to strike when the iron's hot.
3199795	3204717	I went to a movie theater up here to see it and they had like two arcade games in the entire place.
3205497	3209458	You'd think that a movie theater who's expecting, and it's like the number one movie in America right now.
3209538	3215260	Like, wouldn't that get you to go to your route operators and be like, hey, get some more stuff in here right away.
3215300	3216600	We've got some extra space for you.
3216640	3219781	Bring in like a Pac-Man or bring in a racing game or something like that.
3219881	3223662	Or one of those Wreck-It Ralph cabinets that they made, you know, just for fun.
3224082	3224682	Thanks for watching!
3245093	3247655	I still think Electronic had kind of missed its point a little bit too.
3248576	3253039	I mean, I'm really critical of the arcade industry, so I'm not really the right guy to talk about something like that.
3253199	3253580	That's fine.
3256253	3260615	The thing with the Wreck-It Ralph machines is that they're converted Donkey Kong cabinets.
3261115	3268338	So it's not like there's a plethora of those available for them to just fix up and clean up and throw the game into.
3268598	3270899	I'm sure they worked within their means to get that released.
3271439	3274261	So, I mean, yeah, they could hobble something together and release it.
3274281	3281804	But where I think they really missed the mark, and me and a friend of mine was talking about this at an arcade auction last week, why didn't they make a game based on Sugar Rush?
3282554	3293058	How hard would it be to throw a skin on a racing game and add in some of the features that were featured in the movie that were kind of talked about with that game and then push it out as an arcade game?
3293238	3297840	That's the missed cross-promotion opportunity of the year right there.
3298480	3302782	You know you market that in Japan with AKB48 doing the soundtrack and your set.
3303142	3305423	Well, it'd be the new Maximum Tune.
3305751	3308452	I swear I was listening to the end credits going, is that AKB48?
3308512	3310553	It is AKB48!
3311853	3317055	Well, that was kind of big news in the J-pop community, like, kind of how perfume being in Cars 2 was.
3317576	3319436	You know, that kind of got a lot of people talking.
3319496	3325759	I just think they're, I love the movie, it was fantastic, but I think the whole industry kind of missed a lot of points.
3325799	3331361	All the cameos were fantastic, but I think, you know, people didn't really handle the release of that movie properly.
3331381	3333102	I don't think there was enough faith placed in it.
3333562	3333762	Hmm.
3334867	3339369	I got just a couple more questions for you, and then I want to go to the chat to see if they have anything.
3339589	3341090	I already see a few things popping up here.
3341490	3352356	But I've been dying to ask you this for years, and this is a very controversial question within the community, but I have to know what you think about this one being so vested in the community and so forth.
3353697	3357839	And it's about Guitar Hero, and I know this is like, hello, five years ago, but...
3358499	3361120	When this game took off, there was a lot of people in the community.
3361600	3367562	They thought Konami was robbed of Guitar Freaks and Guitar Hero has just come in and taken all the credit.
3367962	3374564	We all remember that review that X-Play did of Beatmania that was ridiculous where they said it was ripping off Guitar Hero and all that.
3375144	3383147	Do you think Guitar Hero, at the end of the day, was it a good thing or was it a bad thing for American fans of Japanese music games?
3384016	3394381	I think Guitar Hero before Red Octane was purchased by Activision was a fantastic thing for the music game community in the US.
3395082	3399124	Before the game was even announced to the public, I got a chance to see it.
3400205	3402426	I was hooked up with the guys at Red Octane.
3402446	3406748	They brought me in to see it shortly after in the Groove PS2 launch party.
3407368	3408589	And I walked out of that
3408769	3409590	I still play rock band like crazy.
3409610	3409730	So, um...
3428826	3447301	I think that it was a great thing, but I think once Activision took a hold of it and then started kind of milking the franchise for everything it was worth, leading to the eventual downfall of the whole band-based music game altogether, I think that that was really kind of where they missed their mark and handled it like they didn't handle it right at all.
3447521	3473885	but I think initially it was a great idea and it's not really like Konami was robbed of it I mean they knew the game was coming out and they made the conscious effort not to release it a lot of people don't remember this either but back in 2000 Guitar Freaks was slated for release in the US I still have a receipt some here and all my random music game collectibles for a pre-order that I placed at FYE in Cleveland, Ohio back in like I want to say March of 2000 for that game and then it got cancelled like last minute
3474264	3486367	Well, I remember playing the arcade version all the time, the US releases, you know, and what was it that someone was telling me, like, when I was still playing it, oh yeah, I've got my pre-order in, you know, just basically what you were saying.
3487288	3497591	But I remember when we got contacted for them to do something for the local news for Guitar Hero at my house, and they made me hide my Guitar Freaks stuff.
3497791	3498331	Yeah.
3499111	3524194	I think that's more of like a lawsuit issue than anything else I mean you know Activision did kind of go or not Activision but Red Octane went around that whole issue the right way and that they worked with Konami to get the licensing cleared for the release on that unlike you know some previous music games have been done so that's kind of weird to hear but no I don't think Konami was really robbed of anything I think that you know that was their fault for not releasing the game when they had the opportunity and really grabbing hold of that market early on
3524787	3525207	Absolutely.
3525268	3531693	Especially if Red Octane was working with Konami over the licensing, then they had their eyes open the whole time.
3532233	3532594	Well, yeah.
3532674	3535036	And that's why Konami ended up producing the arcade cabinet.
3535116	3544564	Part of the licensing agreement that they had for that game was that Konami would take over the rights to produce and build the arcade cabinets for that title.
3545144	3548185	Max Ninja in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com agrees with you.
3548205	3551546	Guitar Heroes 1, 2, and 3 are the best Guitar Hero games after that.
3552006	3553447	It just sucked.
3553487	3555767	I wouldn't even really say Guitar Hero 3 was that great.
3555808	3557068	That was still never soft.
3557448	3563870	It was better than any of their other offerings, but I still wouldn't say that it was like the top tier of the franchise.
3564190	3567571	It was definitely the cliff-teetering game where it's like, oh, here we go.
3567611	3568271	We're on our way down.
3568752	3569472	Yeah, pretty much.
3570012	3580903	I was going to say, I wonder what part of the agreement between Activision and Konami that they decided that they're going to put out a really terrible music game called Rock Revolution and then help the sales of guitar heroes with that.
3581023	3589612	The stories I could tell you that I've heard about that one, because I know guys that worked on that on both sides in America and Japan, and the guys in America were like...
3590172	3590693	DJ Ranma S,
3609787	3610447	Drum Controller.
3610507	3612368	It's better than the Rock Band Drum Controller.
3612468	3613228	It was awesome.
3613668	3615589	But they produced so few of them.
3615629	3617209	Nobody really got a chance to get a hold of those.
3617589	3631814	But one of the stories that I had heard about that game was that the guy who started that whole project in Japan was actually doing it as a quote-unquote revenge project against the companies in America that had put out these rock games.
3632554	3635755	And I don't really know what his meaning of revenge was.
3636155	3638796	Was it to release a really bad game and punish the fans?
3638876	3639516	Or was it like
3640513	3642894	to try to put something out that would take all the sales.
3643094	3649918	That sounds like Wile E. Coyote kind of revenge, where he builds the elaborate trap only to have it blow up in his face.
3650678	3651238	Pretty much.
3653199	3658582	We obviously would not be able to get through an interview with you without talking at least a little bit about DJ Max.
3659142	3665045	And I have to admit, I have loved music games for a very long time.
3665125	3669567	When OLR went through its creative shift a few years ago, we kind of opened ourselves up to the different types of games.
3670027	3675888	I have not been following the DJ Max news as rabidly as I was the earlier Konami series.
3675948	3681029	Although, when I saw the Technica machine in the arcade, I thought it was a good time.
3681369	3685230	And I know there's a lot of stuff that they've been trying to do with the Vita and so forth.
3685850	3696532	What do you think, maybe an old school music game fan like me, who's kind of turned away from that scene a little bit, what do you think maybe I should be looking at in DJ Max?
3696592	3699112	Why should I maybe come back and give DJ Max a look?
3699497	3712963	well it depends on which one you're going to play if you're going to play Technica then that's kind of like a whole different can of worms than if you're going to play the portable games which obviously would take a little bit of importing and dusting off your PSP I think with
3713257	3730343	DJ Maxx is a franchise, and I know there are people out there that know that I work for Pentavision, so I don't want anyone to think that this is like a company shill kind of thing here, but my attraction to the DJ Maxx franchise is kind of the same attraction that I have to Konami's Bimani games, and that's the music that they use in the game is...
3731683	3738845	It's a lot of original producers producing stuff under different genres, and there's a lot of variety to the music in and of itself.
3739685	3745066	My attraction to music games personally has a lot less to do with the gameplay and a lot more to do with the music that they use.
3745526	3753608	So that's kind of where I think the strong point of the DJ Maxx franchise is that they really have a very, very diverse song list across all of the games.
3753928	3755449	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3776585	3780407	Hard rock music, punk rock music, hardcore, classic.
3781508	3782969	That's really where it shines for me.
3783529	3788092	The gameplay in Technica, if you're speaking of that specifically, it's different.
3789273	3797958	There's a lot to it that's similar to the other games, but the whole touchscreen interface and the way that the interface of the game itself functions is different.
3797978	3800139	It was kind of fresh at the time that it came out.
3800219	3802581	Obviously, it's been four years since then, but
3803501	3819746	it's very fresh compared to a lot of other music game interfaces out there and it's not too hard to pick up and just the way that you interact with the game is very fun so I would say if you're a fan of the music that's what you should be looking forward to the most because there's just a ton of really fantastic music in those games
3820063	3820243	All right.
3820283	3824385	Well, we've had Eddie on like way longer than we said we were going to have him on.
3824445	3827646	But if he's down with it, I want to get a few questions from the chat room out.
3827746	3830827	So live.vognetwork.com is the place to ask your questions.
3831207	3835029	Let me ask this one that was asked earlier from Das Bacon who asked –
3836149	3841094	I'm going to say beforehand, by the way, he's my roommate and he works on the website.
3841114	3843436	So his question is kind of like a moot point.
3843777	3844918	Loaded question.
3844978	3845298	All right.
3845779	3848742	I'll ask it anyway since I didn't know that and I thought it was a good question.
3849082	3850424	What is the future of Bomani Style?
3852005	3855589	Well, can I kind of keep pushing forward really?
3855629	3859132	I mean we had a huge server outage earlier in the year and –
3860768	3862851	It caused us to lose all the original data.
3863672	3864553	It's still out there.
3864613	3872063	It's not like the original hard drives died or anything like that, but we don't have access to the server the site used to be hosted on due to a complication with our old host.
3872644	3874427	So there is a good...
3876871	3904112	6 months or so where I just kind of gave up on everything and nothing was getting done but just recently I've got that bug again and I've got a few people helping us out and we're going to just kind of push forward and getting the most recent version that we had been developing for like the past 2 years finished and online with the resources that we have available and people will start seeing that soon with the headline section rolling out we've got a new machine location database on deck
3905553	3908940	ScoreTrackers for just about every single game out there.
3909060	3912406	Even ridiculous stuff like Poppin' Stage will have a ScoreTracker on the website.
3913658	3931044	We're going to do a greatly expanded sim file database because that was one of the most popular things we had on the site with new sorting options and a lot better ways to promote your files than what we had before because there was a lot of really good stuff that would just get hidden amongst a sea of crap.
3932585	3935366	That's one of the things we definitely want to change this time around once we get that going.
3936109	3939856	Legend of Zaku wants to know, is the Bomani Land Ranch still open?
3941138	3943703	We moved from the Bomani Land Ranch.
3943823	3946007	Now we live in what we call the Bomani Land Resort.
3947637	3948858	Second Style.
3949538	3953861	The old house was a ranch house in Anaheim, California, and it was just a really big place.
3953881	3955762	And we had like 30 arcade cabinets there.
3956322	3960605	And the new house, it's not as open to the public as it used to be just because of space.
3960705	3965027	We sold off some of the machines, but we still have all of the key machines.
3965067	3966008	We keep them updated.
3966288	3970711	And now we have a pool and a hot tub and a koi pond and a nice atrium.
3970751	3971151	So it's like a
3971771	3973311	Really kind of a relaxed place to hang out.
3973352	3974572	So it's still open.
3975572	3981494	If you contact me via email or Facebook or whatever, if you're going to be in town, we can arrange to have you come over and hang out.
3981694	3984074	Heck yeah, we come to Disneyland down there all the time.
3984114	3985715	We're going to come storm the place.
3987315	3989476	If you guys come down here and not hang out at my house.
3991627	3991988	Let's see.
3993729	3995230	Shane Alinko is asking a question.
3995270	4000894	I think this is tongue-in-cheek, but I'll ask it anyway because a lot of people always kind of want to know, how do I break into the industry?
4001835	4003356	How can I get hired at Pentavision?
4003376	4005518	I don't even know if this is one you can answer.
4005898	4007399	I honestly don't even know, man.
4007439	4008600	I got hired on accident.
4010130	4016635	Honestly speaking, I got brought in with a bunch of friends of mine to consult for Technica 2 when it first came out.
4016655	4021799	We were helping them with the Technica 2.5 project that never actually ended up happening.
4022379	4024121	In one of the meetings, they
4024935	4025756	and so on.
4045034	4045354	Nice.
4046335	4048116	So you just got to beg and ask a lot.
4063064	4089254	they're really in tune with the fans they like listening to input a lot and they they really feel bad when they do something that ends up disappointing people and uh so really it's just a matter of like i'm sure whenever we end up hiring which isn't really something we have on deck right now but whenever we end up hiring i'm sure you know the the doors will be open to members of the community who are passionate enough that have the skills to want to work with us so just i guess keep an eye out on the pentavision uh global website and
4090135	4093078	If we ever throw up any job postings, give us a contact.
4094159	4095299	Let me ask this question from somebody.
4095319	4098882	They didn't change their nickname, so I'll just call them 693 because that's the number they got.
4099483	4100484	What do you think is the future?
4100544	4102085	We've actually got this from a couple people in chat.
4102165	4105268	What do you think is the future of console rhythm music games?
4105748	4111393	And he follows up and says specifically Bomani CS games, but I'm kind of interested in the general sense.
4111473	4114015	What do you think is the future of console music games?
4115495	4119298	In North America, I really couldn't even give you an honest answer.
4119358	4125702	The market in the US has just proven itself to not be there, especially as of late.
4126002	4129104	Harmonix has a good thing going with the Rock Band 3 setup.
4129344	4135428	The game doesn't need anything else added to it, so just cranking out new songs is perfect for their existing user base.
4135949	4136329	Dance Central...
4141079	4169968	Dance Central and Just Dance and stuff, those will probably continue to be yearly games just because of the necessity of releasing them on a disc there's a lot of data that goes into the moves and choreographing the characters and stuff so I'm sure those will continue to be on disc but as far as hardcore music games I can't be 100% certain of this and I know I'm going to break wide open some news here but Konami didn't show DDR at E3 this year and when I
4170416	4171077	and DarkSakura.com.
4194637	4210242	Something that appeals to arcade fans, something that appeals to fans of Just Dance Up, and then also on top of that, have some sort of, I had envisioned this kind of revolution, adventure, kind of taking their adventure mode, but way beyond where they had it.
4210322	4211182	All right, let the man finish.
4211202	4212303	I want to hear E3 gossip.
4236549	4254070	and um it's speculative on my behalf but I would not be surprised if that had something to do with the delay in the game this year because he was the one that was heading up that entire project so um I know since then things have been handed off to uh U1 who's heading up DDR 2013 in the arcades but um
4255051	4257292	Yeah, as far as the US goes, I really couldn't say.
4257512	4258852	It's too hard to tell.
4259192	4272937	I mean, you know, PentaVision, we're releasing DJ Max Technica tunes soon, but realistically, we're just not sure how it's going to sell because the Vita is not a very widely performing platform right now.
4273557	4273697	And
4275178	4283433	It's been really hard to market that game as a result of some of the contracts we have in place with our worldwide partners, so the word hasn't gotten out about that title enough.
4283834	4287240	In terms of Japanese music games, I don't...
4288297	4294199	My honest opinion is I don't think they really need to do console versions for them anymore, because they have the arcades.
4294839	4304203	And I think that when you do a console version of a game that is primarily an arcade game, like it is over there, you're just taking activity away from the arcades at that point.
4304403	4312166	And so it's not to say that I don't think Konami will ever do another console music game, because obviously they're doing U-Beat and Reflect Beat on the iPad, but
4312526	4314827	I don't think that they really need to do the console games.
4314887	4328615	I know that a lot of North American fans hate me for saying that, and it definitely feels like they're owed those console games, but that's not the way the market works in Japan, and since the games are primarily Japanese, I think that's just kind of the state of where they're at.
4329326	4332248	Without the console version of DDR, how will I make my edit data?
4334989	4341713	See, they made that really crappy Flash utility for DDRX in the US and a whole five people used it.
4343535	4344795	I'm sure there's ways around it.
4344835	4345996	It's not like people aren't clever.
4346116	4352640	There's a guy out there that wrote a utility to let you create edits in Stepmania and then export them as data that you could use in the arcade cabinets.
4352660	4353661	People are
4354571	4357314	People in the Bumani community are way too clever for their own good sometimes.
4357614	4359176	See, I know what the solution to everything is.
4359937	4360557	New Parapara.
4362279	4364441	Dance Masters is, though.
4365142	4367124	I actually like Dance Masters because of the Parapara.
4367677	4370178	Well, Dance Evolution came out as an arcade cabinet in Japan.
4370238	4375181	And apparently, it's one of those games that's not talked about widely, but they get regular updates with new songs.
4376182	4378543	So it's still kind of doing well, I guess.
4378583	4385067	And that was one of the questions that I asked Naoki when we talked at E3 a few years ago when Dance Masters had been first released.
4385467	4387988	I said, I noticed that Night of Fire is in this game.
4388649	4391070	And you used the original routine for it.
4392851	4394512	Is this influenced by Parapara at all?
4394532	4395173	And he was like, no.
4395633	4397554	No, I worked on Parapara, but it's not the same game.
4397574	4398915	But it's Parapara.
4398995	4400496	It's essentially like the Kinect version.
4400716	4405479	Especially since they opened the old location of Valfar up as Nikufar.
4405920	4407381	You know, the Parapara scene's coming back.
4408061	4409742	Yeah, well, they never really died.
4409802	4412724	It just kind of like shrunk and now it's expanding again.
4412824	4417027	So, you know, it's just one of those things, I guess, maybe when it gets big enough...
4418035	4419696	to make them make notice again.
4419896	4422918	And it's got a type of music that it latches onto once again.
4422938	4427520	Because I think, I don't know if the hyper, or was it hyper techno stuff?
4427540	4430022	I don't know if that's still really as relevant as it was a few years ago.
4430102	4437866	But I think if they latch onto a new style of music and it becomes popular in the mainstream of Japan again, you could possibly see another Parapara game get released.
4438675	4439636	I've been playing a little bit of...
4464159	4465080	New Super Mario Bros.
4465440	4469723	2, although I haven't been able to get into it as much as the original one for the DS.
4470904	4480010	Actually, and I feel kind of weird saying it, but I've been really addicted to the Adventure Time Turbo Jumping Fin game on iOS lately.
4480830	4483392	It's such an easy pick-up-and-play.
4483472	4486574	I could play it for two minutes anywhere, and then I'm all over that.
4486594	4487735	I love Adventure Time.
4487775	4490797	I'm obsessed with it, and I can't wait for the game coming out later this month.
4491938	4492618	Other than that,
4495200	4519695	I'm going to start playing Halo 4 soon and I'm planning to pick up Super Paper Mario Sticker Star later on this week nice well Eddie before we let you go I want to get the plugs out there for your stuff if you don't already know about this website and you're into music game fans or if you're into music games I'm not sure how that's possible but BamaniStyle.com is the place to get all the latest and greatest on what's going on in the music game scene especially overseas and so forth right?
4521521	4525543	I don't want to be egotistical about it.
4525563	4537008	There are other resources out there that have been doing a better job than us lately, but we try our best and we have a lot of friends in the industry, so we come up with some pretty interesting stuff from time to time, so I'd say we're worth checking out.
4537328	4537608	Awesome.
4537808	4539909	Anything else you want to plug while you're here on the show tonight?
4540801	4567638	if you guys are in the Chicagoland area this upcoming May I'm not really too sure of the dates I'd go check it out on ASEN.org but we are doing another show at Anime Central this upcoming year with the Japanese guys we haven't announced the roster yet but the guys we have on deck a lot of them have had music in the most recent Konami music games and the parties we do are a really good time you can ask anybody who's been there so check out Anime Central next year in Chicago and come party it up with us
4568172	4568612	DJ Han has been found...
4589457	4593539	working the shoe department of Nordstrom's in Northern California recently.
4594019	4601242	He was spotted not too long ago, and I really wanted to run into the department store and ask him that question, but he wasn't working the day that I was in town.
4602918	4603299	Memories.

4728819	4729700	Absolutely fantastic.
4729760	4735764	So let's talk a little bit about the Wii U because we're very close to the Wii U launch, one week from today.
4736584	4744247	And of course, there's still some of that stuff out there that we don't yet know, but mainly kind of tied with the whole network stuff.
4744287	4747448	So first off, what is Nintendo Network ID?
4747928	4760292	And they actually have this whole kind of either Nintendo Direct press conference, or not even press conference, like consumer conferencing, stream, web video, whatever you want to call it.
4760732	4762574	Anyways, so they talked a little bit about it.
4762634	4766857	Basically what it is is that the friend code system has kind of been, it's gone away.
4767097	4769819	And now it's being replaced by this Nintendo Network ID.
4770360	4777985	And what the ID is going to be used for is basically like the 3DS, they say smartphones and PCs.
4779306	4787673	Also, of course, the Wii U. And it's going to be basically tied so that you have all your software logged into one thing.
4789531	4815197	in layman's terms it's basically going to be an account name so like you know you have an Xbox Live or Playstation Network you have an account that all that stuff's tied to you're going to have an account that's going to be a name and tie it to that and you can make your friends and do all that stuff so fantastic getting with the 21st century and getting rid of stupid friend codes welcome to the big kids table Nintendo yay mommy wow
4815857	4833080	Yes, so it says basically users can exchange the number, whatever this number is, or I guess just like a friend's code, but then also they'll also be able to register friends, I guess they meet with Miiverse.
4833320	4853815	so there may be a number still tied to your account however I think they're going to have a name to that as well or it's going to be just one number that you're going to have for all future Nintendo consoles or whatever so there's that and of course that sounds a lot like the Battle.net battle tags just so you know like where you have like the name and then the random numbers at the end yeah
4854455	4860699	So then also, of course, they've got the Wii U chat stuff, and they said that, of course, you're going to be able to talk to each other using chat.
4861440	4867204	They say that, I guess, users will be able to draw images on the chat window while they talk.
4868264	4871627	And instant hilarity, just add cocks.
4873508	4874909	Because you know that's what's going to happen.
4875189	4876930	What else are people going to draw on the screens?
4877971	4883975	Like, I'm going to have a video chat with Loki, and I'm going to draw a big dick right next to his head, and it'll be hilarious.
4885515	4887737	I think that photo I took at Fry's spells it out.
4889218	4889919	Which one is this?
4890159	4893041	The one where I walked by the monitor and there was a big dick on it that someone drew.
4893882	4894362	Of course.
4896223	4897765	So yeah, they have that stuff.
4897845	4909174	Also, they're saying that I guess people can place calls to each other through the Wii U chat and there's going to be a light on the gamepad that'll blink to indicate that there's an incoming call or something like that.
4909654	4914037	It just sounds like it's very basic stuff that they're just describing in a very complex way that...
4914938	4915158	Wara Wara?
4940020	4940300	Yes.
4940640	4942041	Yeah, that's going to change for the US.
4942481	4949183	Yeah, it's... Well, actually, apparently the English name will be the Wariwara Plaza.
4950923	4951563	I'm fine with that.
4952304	4954724	Which... The distant cousin of Woohoo Island.
4955044	4956965	Which, why can't it be Mi Plaza?
4957345	4959166	Or the Wii U Plaza?
4959406	4961726	Or the home screen?
4962027	4962947	Or something like that?
4963387	4965428	Why does it have to be something ridiculous?
4965668	4966868	No, it should be Mi Goosta.
4969465	4982658	but anyways yeah so it looks like you know basically your meat plaza that you had had on the Wii except now there's you know titles that you may have played in the Wii U games and stuff like that that they're huddling around which
4984435	4987497	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5006932	5009333	Well, you may have a connection at work or something like that.
5009393	5010113	I'm just saying.
5011113	5013054	You may not have a connection to the internet at home.
5013334	5014094	You got me there.
5014395	5016675	Or your console may not be in an area.
5017296	5021537	Maybe you're in the Dark Ages and you don't have a Wi-Fi router or something like that.
5021717	5025358	Or it just doesn't work through your walls or whatever.
5025558	5026959	You may have connectivity issues.
5027879	5031764	Either way, so you're going to have to download this as a day one download.
5032284	5035187	This and I believe the internet browser are going to be part of that.
5039773	5040314	V-Board V-Board
5067274	5068795	and asked them some questions.
5068835	5070835	And of course, there's YouTubes of it all over the internet.
5071535	5075477	Newell did say no Half-Life 3 questions, so that wasn't out there.
5075537	5080678	But that doesn't mean they couldn't get some other questions, such as, is Valve working on a new Source engine?
5081098	5084339	And Newell said, we've been working on a new engine stuff for a while.
5085119	5090341	There was some garbled audio with subtitles that say, we've just been waiting for a game to roll it out with.
5091501	5095904	And there was another question asked saying, is it more than just an extension to Source?
5095964	5097925	Like, is it an entirely new engine?
5098325	5100246	And Gabe Newell said, yeah.
5101027	5105569	So apparently the rumor mill is still pumping out there on Source 2.
5105649	5108191	This is after the uncovered code in August.
5108331	5108611	DarkSakura
5136867	5163316	oh square oh square we need sad music we need we need a dirge we need sad music I don't yeah what about Aerith dying music all right all right we can do we can do all right I'll get some sad music but that's happy music for me Eric living or dead Earth living music I don't know yeah well Aerith dying music was happy for me because I hated her
5163928	5167371	Just be the sound of the sword winning through her over and over.
5168792	5172675	Ten hours of sword... That's better.
5174933	5178396	So, Final Fantasy XIV has come to an end.
5178936	5180617	Dun, dun, dun.
5181518	5188983	And, yeah, instead of some of the stuff that people were promised, what they had was basically server farting.
5189724	5191165	They got a really nice cinematic.
5193566	5194887	Yay, it's happy music.
5194927	5197669	I'm just imagining the actual literal server farting.
5197890	5199311	Like, this is the end.
5199351	5199531	Boom.
5204261	5207524	You shouldn't be making fart noises over this very sad song.
5208045	5209326	This is happy music.
5212490	5214051	Remember, vote for us at the podcast awards.
5219317	5220598	Yay, she's dead.
5220858	5221339	Awesome.
5222059	5222960	My favorite part.
5223881	5225283	My save file still works, Rob, by the way.
5227283	5231864	Anyway, people were basically logging on you.
5231965	5236326	Those few loyal, deluded people who were still into the game.
5236366	5238807	Hey, I have friends that were still playing Final Fantasy XIV.
5239247	5239867	Like I said, deluded.
5239927	5240907	You like what you like.
5242108	5247229	I can't make fun of anybody this week because I've popped so many squares on that Curiosity Cube.
5247389	5248429	I can't judge anybody.
5248470	5248730	I'm sorry.
5248750	5249870	You know what?
5249970	5252431	What was the line from Monty Python?
5252971	5254411	Don't know much about art, but I know what I like.
5255832	5256012	Yeah.
5257292	5262095	So, um... I'm just going to read the quote from here from one of the players.
5262455	5270780	There were so many waiting to log in and fight in the promised epic battles that Square Enix had to start turning players away based on subscription end date.
5271820	5276863	So those who were in had bad lag, especially in menus, and couldn't form parties.
5277704	5284667	And when they actually did get to fight some of these epic monsters they were promised, they were...
5286930	5300688	and it was like these level 100 monsters that were only ever seen in cutscenes they really couldn't get much about it and so basically the last server message just pretty much bleeped over and over again confound contact with main host
5303482	5304082	What a way to go.
5304383	5308025	Yeah, but there's a pretty nice cinematic up on Kotaku, so go watch that.
5308366	5310507	That's the only good thing to ever come out of Final Fantasy XIV.
5310647	5313009	Actually, by pretty nice, you mean pretty fucking amazing.
5313389	5315551	If you do watch cinematic, it's pretty epic.
5317112	5319193	I'm very curious about this Realm Reborn.
5319253	5327439	I mean, I can't believe they went so far as to just pull the fucking plug on XIV as it was and saying, all right, hold up, you guys.
5327539	5328120	We got this.
5328240	5330442	Just give us about six months to get it up and running again.
5330462	5332163	It's crazy, so...
5332572	5337335	Alright, we'll just do a real update this time instead of just like poo-pooing out something.
5338596	5339677	Alright, well we'll see what happens.
5339757	5342779	If it was worth the wait or if it is poo-poo.
5343359	5346822	In the meantime, something a little closer to look forward to.
5346882	5348063	This week's release dates.
5348803	5349404	Oh my god.
5349544	5352086	There's a little bit happening in the States this week, isn't there, Loki?
5353227	5360574	Just a tad bit, considering that we've got the Wii U launch, so there's every goddamn game coming out on the Wii U all at one time.
5360734	5362196	Let's talk about the big stuff first.
5362236	5363177	Of course, obviously...
5363977	5370461	The biggest game of the year, and this is probably by sales, this is not necessarily on popularity, but it is pretty popular as well.
5370521	5378966	Call of Duty Black Ops 2, coming out on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, the Wii U, and PC.
5379647	5382288	And very big title, very popular.

5512870	5513670	Can't see up here.
5513710	5514811	Gotta make that extra money.
5515291	5516551	Oh, UFC trainer.

5528816	5532278	Book of Spells on PS3 this week.
5532738	5533918	Should have just been reading Rainbow.

5652238	5653639	Oh my god, billionaire.
5653939	5654479	Billionaire.
5654659	5655600	Can you imagine, though?
5656521	5664886	Imagine, flash forward, seven months from now, at Disney Infinity, and how fucking ridiculous that's gonna get.
5665026	5666327	I can't wait to own it all!
5666347	5667448	I know.
5667628	5667928	I know.
5668869	5672470	I'm gonna be one of those mothers banging down the McDonald's door.
5672590	5673851	I want my beanie baby!
5674291	5676451	Rob wants to be the very best.

5739987	5744970	The latter, Reborn is replacing it And yes, XIV is dead now There is this gap
5745370	5745770	happening.
5745810	5750014	And YYR mentions it a little earlier in chat with, what did he say?
5750614	5752136	They're really going to have to start over.
5752236	5754998	Shouldn't they have wanted to at least retain the small audience they had?
5756419	5758240	They are hoping they'll come back.
5758521	5763144	And I think the ones that were loyal to 14 until the very end, I think they will come back.
5763565	5766887	I mean, for them to have held out on that game that long, they'll come back.
5767288	5769770	Here's my prediction for the whole thing.
5770410	5771071	Wah, wah.
5771371	5773153	I'll come back when they make 11, free to play.
5773473	5775535	I'll withhold judgment until I see it.
5776576	5781040	You know, if 14, the real one, which is really what this is now.
5781060	5784523	I know they're calling it reborn, but they want us to see it as Final Fantasy 14.
5784603	5785724	No, really this time.
5786084	5786685	Oops, our bad.
5786725	5787466	This is the real one.
5788206	5791670	If it's a good game, then it's a good game, and I've got to play a good game, right?
5792450	5792830	We'll see.
5793991	5795112	Alright, anyhow.
5795172	5797794	Moving to Japan and the releases over there.
5797834	5798935	There's quite a bit over there as well.
5799075	5801777	Assassin's Creed 3 gets its Japanese release on the 15th.
5802158	5808642	Some Platinum Collection titles, Dance Central, Kinect Sports, including Season 2, and what they call the Ultimate Collection, which is both.
5809063	5812966	Need for Speed Most Wanted gets a Criterion release.
5813246	5814467	Nike and Kinect Training
5815087	5816148	and Steins Gate.
5816428	5820389	Hiyoko Runiri no Darling also gets a price reduction as well.
5820489	5824571	So lots of price reductions and Assassin's Creed 3 just in time for the holidays.
5825131	5833995	On the PlayStation 3, also Assassin's Creed 3, Need for Speed Most Wanted and Dream Club Complete, Edipyon gets a release.
5834035	5835896	That's from D3 on the PlayStation 3.
5836776	5844222	Going to the handhelds on the PlayStation Vita, Assassin's Creed 3, Lady Liberty is there, as well as a Need for Speed Most Wanted release.
5844843	5847765	And some new Vita packs are coming out.
5848866	5852289	The 3G Wi-Fi model in Cosmic Red and Sapphire Blue.
5852349	5853690	I remember reading about those earlier.
5853991	5856212	Those are finally seeing their release in Japan this week.
5856273	5860276	So if you've been waiting for that pretty blue PS Vita, Shane, there it is.
5862077	5862298	On the 3DS...
5864239	5867522	and Aikatsu Cinderella Lesson comes out.
5868262	5869823	I don't know what lesson they'll be teaching.
5870424	5871444	Clean the toilets.
5872105	5873186	Change the firewood.
5873426	5875247	It's a game to teach you how to clean your house.
5875287	5876008	That'd be hilarious.
5876940	5877180	on the 3DS.
5895829	5899912	Now, I'm looking at this and I don't think this is like Cinderella like the fairy tale.
5899932	5901092	Of course not.
5901233	5906636	This girl dressed up in the little Playboy bunny outfit and pink skirt, that's not what I think of when I think of Cinderella.
5906936	5909378	It looks like overtly shoujo manga style.
5909698	5912840	Yeah, so I don't think like Disney Cinderella.
5912880	5915442	I'm thinking it's a little something else.
5915462	5916702	Isn't the lesson still the same?
5919744	5922126	Cinderella's lesson was if you want that man, you go get him.
5924110	5929048	And you take lots of drugs, so you think that you're being met by fairy godmothers.
5929068	5930372	Jamie Reed released dates for the UK.
5931580	5932221	I guess.
5933221	5933602	Rab.
5935043	5940127	On the 13th, we have Call of Duty Black Ops 2, Rift Storm Legion for PC.
5940707	5943650	On the 14th, we have Wonder Book, one book, a thousand stories.
5944290	5946212	And El Cubo, whatever that is.
5947393	5948834	And let's see, when is the weekend?
5948934	5954058	Okay, on the 16th, we have Sonic... Well, obviously, it's the Spanish cube if it's El Cubo.
5956440	5957861	Maybe it's El Cubo, maybe.
5958821	5959362	There's no cube.
5960176	5986490	16th we have Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed and Sims 3 The Seasons you know what I quit Sims 3 after World Adventures because I had way too much custom content that it lagged my game it was really El Cubo is the re-release of the GameCube the Latin America version for England well they like to mix it up a bit somehow I don't think that's Castilian Spanish
5988786	5992448	Hey, I may be an expert at Spanish, but that sounds pretty sound to me.
5993928	5995689	L anything is Spanish.
5997630	5998391	It could be Portuguese.
5999671	6000232	It could be.
6001472	6005254	Or it could be moving on with more news in the Classic Game of the Week coming up real soon.
6005974	6006294	All right.
6007055	6015659	So, as I kind of alluded to earlier with the need to sell some of those combo packs for UFC, THQ's not doing real well.
6016139	6017080	And I'll see you next time.
6041189	6044791	The problem is, now their stock has dropped down to $1.74.
6046031	6044791	42%.
6046111	6054015	So, if you think about it, those stocks really wouldn't be worth crap.
6054955	6056456	They'd be worth like 17 cents.
6057216	6057737	Good times.
6057957	6059477	Good times, yeah.
6059617	6061178	So, that is unfortunate.
6061458	6067161	And of course, I'm sure it's not helping by the fact that a lot of those games have kind of
6068712	6070835	Oh, I'm sorry, it actually closed down to 150.
6071456	6073759	It dropped even further, so 50%.
6074800	6080368	So it's probably not helping that a lot of the games that they were going to be coming out with have been delayed.
6081029	6084073	And I understand why they're doing it, and it's...
6085535	6088536	Shadow Next Gen follows that up with People said that six months ago.
6104881	6106361	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6127508	6144758	and you know even as you know kind of alluded to they were saying you know when I joined THQ the company made a public commitment to the quality of titles and we've always expected that in some cases this would mean that more time would be needed to make sure that every title is of the highest possible quality
6145898	6158262	Our fourth quarter releases are the first titles that I have that had the ability to materially impact an experience told me that games needed additional development time to be market ready.
6159142	6164584	Thank you for releasing games that are polished as opposed to just putting them out there because
6166035	6166736	We want to make money.
6167316	6176865	So let's hope that that actually pays off and these games are even better than what they would have been had they just put them out when they were ready to put them out.
6177445	6177926	So we'll see.
6178506	6186754	However, that's still not helping the fact that they defaulted on their $50 million loan that they had with Wells Fargo.
6187495	6189777	So not too good.
6191460	6192220	Sad Trombone
6206792	6207092	Not good.
6207432	6213995	So hopefully they will be able to kind of recoup from all these losses and stuff and put out some good games.
6214415	6216716	I mean, after all, South Park looks awesome.
6217376	6220857	Not a big fan of Company of Heroes, but Metro Last Light looks pretty sweet.
6221778	6223598	And you need a Saints Row 4, right?
6223918	6225599	That's what Rama in our chat room just said.
6225839	6232364	You know... They better give me my Saints Row 4 before they go down like a claim.
6232484	6233745	Let me put it this way.
6234185	6239929	Saints Row, what they were planning to do with that, the whole Enter the Dominatrix thing, which, to be honest, looked like shit.
6240910	6243231	I would have still bought it, but it still looks like shit.
6244052	6246734	But they're making a fourth game that's supposed to be better, but...
6247234	6247695	Thanks for watching!
6273278	6277622	All right, let's move on to some announcements from Blizzard, who also had an earnings call this week.
6278503	6285510	StarCraft II Heart of the Swarm, this expansion they've been working on for quite a while, is finally due out in the first half of 2013.
6285590	6289594	That's according to Mike Morhaime, who is the head of Blizzard.
6289634	6292116	He did make that announcement during Activision's earnings call this week.
6292356	6296259	saying that they are, quote, working hard towards a first half 2013 launch.
6296599	6299641	That wouldn't be too surprising to anyone who's been following Blizzard for a while.
6299981	6307686	They put out two big games this year already between Diablo 3 and Mists of Pandaria, so them holding onto this for 2013 is no surprise at all.
6308147	6314311	I would think, though, it's going to happen after the end of the fiscal quarter to give them something to buoy up the next fiscal year.
6314591	6315071	But we'll see.
6315171	6315432	We'll see.
6316392	6326398	Speaking of Diablo 3, they have surpassed 10 million sold and it was confirmed to I'm sure no one's surprise an expansion for Diablo 3 is in the works.
6326858	6331181	I'd be very curious to see how that expansion does though because let's not forget a lot of those Diablo 3s
6331761	6333001	Well, maybe that's not fair.
6333041	6337503	I was going to say a lot, but it's more like a million came through that annual pass.
6337863	6339304	And I guess one million out of ten million.
6339324	6341224	Still ten percent is pretty big.
6341304	6342525	But I'd be very curious.
6342865	6346266	Diablo 3 hasn't exactly had the warmest reception either.
6346586	6348327	It has its fans, certainly.
6348767	6352848	But I just don't hear about it the same way I heard the enthusiasm for Diablo 2.
6353509	6356069	And I know some Diablo fans might want to challenge me on that, and that's fine.
6356089	6359431	But I don't hear that same enthusiasm that I heard behind Diablo 2.
6360852	6363206	So I'd be very curious how an expansion is going to do for them.
6364721	6366622	But I'm sure it would be as well received as Starcraft 2.
6366662	6372206	I mean, Starcraft 2 also, you know, it's popular but not popular like Starcraft 1 was.
6372226	6373527	Does that make sense?
6373727	6374047	I don't know.
6375068	6379751	Also, a class action lawsuit being filed against Blizzard.
6381392	6384034	You know, they make World of Warcraft, Starcraft, Diablo 3.
6384694	6386916	It has to do with the authenticators.
6387977	6392640	Apparently, who are the guys that are filing this lawsuit here?
6395462	6399226	and Carnie William Bates Pullum and Bowman PLLC.
6399446	6401989	They are litigating Benjamin Bell et al.
6402049	6411099	versus Blizzard Entertainment saying that all of this is negligent and deceptive practices related to Blizzard's customers' account security.
6411179	6412440	The fact that for Blizzard
6412680	6413660	Don't they have a PC app now?
6413700	6414061	I don't think so.
6414101	6414681	Just on smartphones.
6414701	6414861	Maybe.
6414881	6415221	I don't know.
6415241	6417422	I've had the smartphone one for so long, I don't know.
6417442	6418602	The claim is drawing against the August 9th.
6440331	6444895	Battle.net breach where Blizzard, they actually disclosed that yes, people got in.
6445516	6449560	They didn't get any sensitive information, but we're making people reset their passwords anyways.
6450220	6459189	And the lawsuit saying that Blizzard's negligence in maintaining proper security protocols is resulting in deceptive upselling.
6459489	6469171	So in other words, because Blizzard can't protect their shit or is negligent in protecting their shit, they're selling you an authenticator so that they're making you buy this to protect your shit.
6469191	6481253	That's going to get thrown out because, honestly, I've had an authenticator for years and it hasn't done a damn thing for anyone getting in and getting any information.
6482693	6484714	The authenticator had nothing to do with it.
6485154	6485714	It wasn't...
6487415	6490577	I think that they got encrypted data.
6490937	6491297	What was it?
6491377	6492137	Nothing solid?
6492518	6497481	And it was anything that could have been changed immediately that wouldn't have changed his present level of security.
6497981	6499081	Well, here's the thing, though.
6499161	6503244	I mean, as much as I do think, I agree with you, it's going to get thrown out of court.
6503744	6511328	But I would like to know, why were so many Blizzard accounts hacked before the mobile authenticator came out?
6511628	6516451	Because there was about a year gap where you only had the $6.50 ones.
6516511	6523095	And as a Warcraft player, I did feel like, why are they making me buy an authenticator when they can't protect my shit?
6523695	6526417	And I was like, why are so many people getting hacked?
6526497	6527257	What happened here?
6527357	6528698	How did all our passwords get out?
6529178	6530979	I kind of would like that to come to light.
6531140	6535243	I would like to know how many million people have had to call Blizzard because of an account breach.
6535563	6547012	Granted, I think that the authenticator was more put out as something that was for peace of mind because I've done remote work where I had to have an on-site authenticator to get into the server.
6547572	6551736	So it's basically an added layer of protection on user side.
6552296	6557781	I think that it doesn't really matter how much security you have on the website.
6557821	6559382	If someone wants to get in, they're going to get in.
6560283	6563526	So this basically just gives you an extra layer.
6564967	6569231	And if anything, I would think that the authenticator price was just to cover the cost of the actual authenticator.
6569251	6571973	I don't think they're actually profiting off of it because if...
6573206	6581432	It was something that required having a device in your hands to basically pair the random numbers with.
6583274	6598486	It's not like something that you... Obviously, once smartphones came out to the masses and everything like that, they could do an app instead, but that's probably why they had to sell it in the first place, because they don't want to lose $6.50 on every single one they send out for people.
6598746	6599086	Granted...
6599927	6603071	They should have just included it in the collector's edition, though.
6603291	6603751	I don't know.
6603871	6605113	I don't understand why they didn't include it.
6605133	6606334	Did they do that, actually, in some of them?
6606694	6606815	No.
6606915	6609858	I thought that they had one of the expansions that had an authenticator in there.
6610098	6611700	I don't think it was Warcraft.
6613021	6614881	Might have been StarCraft, but I don't remember.
6614901	6616442	They were just handing them out at cons.
6616782	6617622	Yeah, but that's different.
6619302	6619582	All right.
6619983	6625264	Anyhow, we need to take a time back into classic gaming and classic games history.
6625764	6628744	And remember when things weren't so simple and so much shit was getting hacked.
6629945	6631765	At least I don't think this game ever got hacked.
6632225	6633025	Wrong hacks.
6633105	6633486	Hello.
6633606	6635366	It stole your credit card information.
6636069	6637009	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6665540	6666600	I like this one.
6667201	6670221	I'm surprised I haven't done it because I actually really like Super Pac-Man.
6671422	6678064	Actually, the thing that I linked is basically someone figuring out the ghost patterns in the game and totally manipulating a full game.
6681005	6687747	Anyway, in Super Pac-Man, it was the second game in the series that was actually done by Namco.
6688207	6688367	Ms.
6688407	6689887	Pac-Man was done by Midway.
6691648	6694209	This is a true Namco sequel
6695189	6700711	But, you know, people didn't really care for it as much because it changed the gameplay really radically.
6702251	6708753	It actually, in the game, you actually went around and ate fruit instead of the little power pills.
6709053	6712994	And then you did get special pellets.
6713054	6717595	You had your regular power pills, which you could use to eat ghosts.
6718275	6723739	You had keys that you could get to unlock doors so that you could get to the fruits inside.
6724340	6726021	And then you had super pellets.
6726201	6731765	And if you got the super pellet, then you would turn into Super Pac-Man and could go through doors and fly over everything.
6732126	6734568	And you had a button that would make you go faster.
6736269	6744095	On top of that, there was a little neat... I thought it was a neat little effect where the ghosts would kind of flatten down a bit to make it look like you were really flying over them.
6745095	6745196	Um...
6745976	6759173	Now, you could not eat a ghost, a super Pac-Man, but if you ate a power pill, like a regular power pill while you were in super mode, then you could eat ghosts.
6760595	6760675	Um...
6762196	6789962	the big thing about that is you also had bonus levels too after every second level where basically you just try to go through and eat the fruit and everything as fast as you can with this one it's actually one of the first Pac-Man games that used the Motorola 6809 processor the previous one used the Z80 and so this went into the same category as Galaxian for the conversion class and
6792162	6799585	However, it didn't really prove to be very successful because it was actually very different than the usual gameplay.
6799625	6801065	It was kind of fucking weird, actually.
6801145	6801485	It was.
6801945	6806207	Pac-Man Plus, which was just an updated version of the original, kind of like Ms.
6806227	6810328	Pac-Man, basically outsold it.
6810468	6820032	Midway also did Junior Pac-Man, which also went on the old Z80 processor, and that one also went to be a very successful Pac-Man game.
6820872	6827097	However, they do say that the AI for Super Pac-Man is one of the best of that time.
6828798	6831740	Super Pac-Man has been out on a lot of different systems.
6831840	6837905	In 84 there was a port for the Atari 5200, but it never came out because of the video game crash.
6838025	6839786	Why is he eating shoes in this level?
6839826	6840667	You don't eat shoes.
6840867	6841387	I don't know.
6841688	6844530	I get the donuts and the burgers and the apples, but shoes?
6844950	6845630	Don't eat shoes.
6846531	6848434	Leather.
6849456	6853262	In 1988, there was a Dawson Commodore 64 version that came out by Thunder Mountain.
6853903	6854503	Did you have this?
6854564	6855144	Yeah, Commodore 64.
6857015	6864479	In 96, it showed up on the A for the Namco Museum Arcade Compilation on the PlayStation.
6864559	6870522	In 98, it came out for Namco History Volume 3, and that was on the PC in Japan only.
6870822	6873403	In 99, Super Pac-Man was released with Ms.
6873443	6874664	Pac-Man in Ms.
6874684	6877065	Pac-Man Special Color Edition for the Game Boy Color.
6877285	6878546	I had that, and I played the crap.
6880167	6887153	2006, there was a plug and play Super Pac-Man that included that along with Pac-Man, Pac-Man Plus, and Pac and Pal.
6887494	6889836	Which, honestly, Pac and Pal is seriously not one of my favorites.
6891197	6896821	And then it also came in the TV games Pac-Man Gold Edition and the Retro Arcade.
6897422	6902987	Namco has also done a portable version for cell phones that are put out by Sprint.
6905109	6912160	Um, Sprint and Namco actually had a sweepstakes where you could win a Volkswagen New Beetle customized with Super Pac-Man art.
6912841	6914424	And it was on display at E3 in 2006.
6914584	6916447	Can you revert this?
6918200	6919601	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6946574	6950018	and then we have it on the Namco Museum Virtual Arcade for Xbox 360 that came out in 2008.
6951380	6951820	So there you go.
6952661	6953182	Super Pac-Man.
6953956	6956857	There it is, your classic game of the week, Super Pac-Man.
6956998	6958638	I like this one, even though it was really weird.
6958979	6959559	It was weird.
6959999	6960439	I liked it.
6960459	6963301	But I mean, you know how I feel about weird.
6963381	6964301	I love that cutscene.
6964721	6965522	He's like, grin.
6966342	6970744	It's the one where a giant ball of Pac-Man falls on the ghost, they turn blue and squish.
6970764	6972065	Don't eat mushrooms.
6972245	6973406	Some of them are poisonous.
6973426	6974446	But what if they're shiitake?
6974486	6975547	Shiitake are delicious.
6975927	6976647	I guess that's right.
6976967	6981550	I made the best dinner that was shiitake mushrooms, enoki mushrooms, and...
6983462	6987607	God, now I can't remember, but there are these other little mushrooms that kind of join at the base, and you have to cut the base off.
6987647	6988407	It was so good anyway.
6989509	6990870	The front lawn mushrooms.
6991190	6992772	No, not front lawn mushrooms.
6993453	6994174	All right, anyhow.
6994895	6995315	Shimeji.
6996396	6996656	All right.
6996677	6997197	They're so delicious.
6997257	7003984	Super Pac-Man, your classic game of the week, in a million different Namco collections, as Jamie mentioned there a little bit ago.
7005546	7007328	We're actually not taking a break tonight.
7008009	7010832	We have another interview, and this one's prior taped.
7011593	7024146	This is actually coming to us from DJ Ranma S and Anime Jam Session, which is a show you can hear at the Voice of Geeks Network or vognetwork.com on Tuesday nights, replaying on Thursday mornings.
7024646	7037229	and at a recent convention, Ranma got this interview with Jen and she is with the website, I don't want to mess this up, it's ggvogue.com, g-g-v-o-g-u-e.com.
7037509	7046411	That is Girl Gamer Vogue and Ranma is going to ask her in this interview some questions about the website and why she started it and all that good stuff.
7046471	7051672	So take it away, DJ Ranma S. We'll be back after this interview with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
7051692	7053773	It's about a 10-minute interview, so we'll be back after this.
7054113	7055174	Hi, DJ Ranma S here.
7055234	7057736	We're here on a special trip here in New York City.
7057776	7058657	We're traveling around.
7058958	7060819	We're out on a special mission.
7060859	7064042	We're checking out a special event called New York City Girl Gamer Event.
7064062	7064683	Is that correct?
7064823	7065003	Yep.
7065484	7065824	Thank you.
7065984	7067606	And my guest here, please introduce yourself.
7067886	7069948	Hi, I'm Jennifer, a.k.a.
7069988	7072050	Nars from Girl Gamer Vogue.
7073434	7077897	Girl Gamer VOG here to get girls out to play all types of video games and so forth.
7077917	7080298	Is that pretty much what the point of tonight's meetup is?
7080699	7081459	Absolutely.
7081980	7090605	We definitely try to get girls from all over the Tri-State area to kind of just get together, to meet other girls, to find other venues and genres that they play with.
7090885	7095388	and just to have an atmosphere in a community that they feel pretty proud and comfortable in.
7096288	7108776	Our number one passion and mission is to just provide a wonderful atmosphere for girl gamers and empower and inspire them actually because ultimately girls need that community.
7108856	7110197	We need that community.
7110257	7115080	We need to find other girls who play games and just play.
7115640	7116481	That sounds pretty cool.
7116561	7118682	So what made you come up with this whole idea?
7119444	7123249	To be honest, I've been gaming ever since I was like five.
7123329	7129155	Like I remember having an NES and just playing it and it was actually taken away from me by my uncle.
7129295	7132359	But I was really a hardcore Sega fan.
7132399	7137104	I'm a hardcore Sega fan up until the Dreamcast when it actually kind of just like fell off the face of the earth.
7137164	7139026	I mean, now they're more of a software company.
7139366	7144670	But I always realized and remembered feeling that I never had a girl that I could always play with.
7145150	7150494	I went to an all-girls school up until high school, and I never had the companionship.
7150654	7154717	And I saw that the world lacked that, a place where you could find that companionship.
7154737	7166446	It's like, yeah, you can go to forums, but there isn't a specific venue that you can kind of just find a girl that is looking for, you know, Guild Wars 2, you know, guildmate, or even if it's just Call of Duty.
7166666	7166826	Okay.
7167207	7167527	Yeah.
7168237	7169017	That sounds pretty cool.
7169038	7176402	So what makes Girl Gamer Bowl different from other female gamer clans like the D20 girls or something like that?
7176722	7177983	What makes it kind of different?
7178523	7180585	Well, we're not a clan per se.
7181225	7183586	We're a means to an end, if anything.
7183626	7190511	If you're looking for a clan, if you're looking for friends, we're the place that you would go to in order to find that clan.
7190831	7195754	So you're pretty much like the liaison to connect other gaming girls to other clans.
7196294	7199096	Groups and Clans and Teams and so forth.
7199216	7199556	Okay.
7214724	7218927	We also do kind of like 101 gaming for moms.
7218967	7225471	So if you're a mom out there and your child is a son or a daughter who's really into games, we teach you about the ESRB rating.
7225511	7228173	We teach you about what games are good for your child.
7228433	7234156	We also talk about games you can play as a mom who's not very familiar with games as well.
7234537	7235337	That sounds pretty cool.
7235357	7238199	So how long have you been running this organization?
7238837	7246260	Um, officially it's been running since November 2011, but, you know, it's always been a dream and a passion ever since I can remember, yeah.
7247281	7250302	So, where do you see this site going?
7250522	7251803	What's your vision for it?
7252603	7257986	Um, I, you know, to be honest with anything, you know, I don't have any expectations when it comes to this.
7258026	7260667	It's kind of just like, I want to do more.
7260767	7267090	Like, we definitely want to be able to just bring more women and more girls and more gamers into this community because...
7267894	7276540	We want to become a positive representation of the gaming community because in actuality, that's how the gaming community started.
7276640	7281944	It started out with gamers very passionate about their hobbies and promoting it.
7282164	7288668	I feel right now, I'm not going to say it's unbalanced, but I feel like there's not a lot of representations for females.
7288708	7291270	There's not a lot of places that they can go to
7291877	7298242	to either A, get the kind of newsfeeds they want, or B, get the kind of information they need.
7298902	7306528	We talk about video game fashion, and we talk about this is actually a Legend of Zelda Zoro Sapphire from Ocarina of Time.
7306748	7308490	It's a jewel, but it's been made out of a necklace.
7308590	7311652	And we showcase things like that because they're important.
7311752	7318057	Like if a girl, or particularly a girl, if she wanted to buy that, she could be able to find it on our website.
7318077	7318698	That's pretty cool.
7319890	7321731	I like that concept.
7322011	7328014	I'm just saying, I just like the idea of it and what you're working with and where it's going so far.
7328174	7328674	Thank you.
7328754	7331776	So, outside of this, what kind of games do you like to play?
7331796	7335017	Wow, what kind of games do I like to play?
7335177	7342681	I mean, right now I'm playing Guild Wars 2 and I love Guild Wars 2 because I played Aeon and World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy and I played LOL and...
7344185	7350250	It's just, I love, I don't like, okay, the I hit you, you hit me kind of gaming.
7350370	7356635	So Guild of Wars, I actually write for Game Tire and I wrote an article about the top 15 qualities for an MMORPG.
7357395	7364061	And Guild of Wars 2 just seems to be nailing 85-90% of anything that I was asking for an MMORPG.
7364821	7389209	Granted, it's not like WoW, because WoW will always, I mean, like, the endgame is just, like, the endgame, like, in Sins and Raids and World of Warcraft, it's just, you can't get that in Guild Wars 2, but Guild Wars 2 has just so much more opportunities for you to explore, like, you get, you know, you get points, and you get rewarding experiences for helping out, and I feel like Guild Wars 2 actually has, like, this social aspect.
7390330	7394471	I play, you know, mostly PS3 and PS2 and PS1 games, I am a Sony fan,
7394875	7396856	But I'm completely a diehard Sega fan.
7396896	7398016	I still have my Sega Dreamcast.
7398076	7399236	I still have my Genesis.
7399637	7402157	I didn't get a Saturn, but I do have a GameCube.
7402177	7404558	But do you also have a Master System?
7405519	7406939	I don't have a Master System.
7407219	7408900	We might have to get her a Master System.
7408980	7409860	I would love a Master System.
7410776	7413698	I might know someone that may have a spare, but I'll have to double check with that.
7414498	7416579	It's not that I didn't have it because I didn't want it.
7416679	7419280	I didn't have it because of fun reasons.
7419881	7421261	It's all good.
7421621	7428865	Now, while running around Game of Thrones, have you ever ran into any difficulties or any guys going, what, you know?
7429537	7436699	You know, to be honest, yeah, but if I stopped when I came about, I wouldn't be where I am right now.
7436719	7437219	That's good.
7437259	7446081	Like, you really need to understand that you will come across people that want you to fail, but you gotta understand that you're doing something that's you.
7446481	7447761	Like, you are a gamer.
7447921	7448501	I'm a gamer.
7448601	7453202	And I know I'm a gamer, and I know what I'm doing, regardless of what anyone says, makes me happy.
7453702	7454362	Well, there you go.
7454402	7457243	I mean, I can't argue with that type of logic, so...
7457602	7463970	Before we get out of here, do you have any last words for any game girls out there who are like, well, I don't know, you know.
7464711	7469037	You know, to be honest, you can deny being a gamer all you want.
7470084	7479566	The moment you embrace it and be who you are, even if you play Farmville, even if you play a 3DS, it doesn't matter.
7480146	7485808	If you're playing something that is immersed into a digital world, you're playing a game.
7486328	7494269	And you shouldn't, A, demote it as not being a game, and B, you shouldn't diminish anybody else that's following that.
7494890	7497050	The video game community is changing constantly.
7497370	7505152	to include everything from science to medicine to psychology to even the industry booming in business.
7505192	7507633	I mean, even fashion is becoming a big part of it.
7508133	7517916	And the moment that you discriminate and divide yourself, you're becoming a factor in the divide in the gaming industry that me and many other people are fighting against.
7518676	7521977	Wow, those are some strong, powerful words.
7521997	7525118	Okay, so let me ask you.
7525138	7525418	Mm-hmm.
7526823	7530066	Girl Gamer, Gamer Girl, doesn't really matter.
7530346	7531187	It doesn't matter.
7531507	7545579	What matters mostly is that if you say you're a girl gamer or a gamer girl and then you start posting photos with you with controllers covering your boobs, you're giving a terrible interpretation of what a girl gamer is.
7546360	7547721	That is the line.
7548021	7559610	If you are not a girl gamer and you're out there and you're promoting that you're a girl gamer and you're doing very sensual, provocative images and representation, you are hindering what we're working for.
7560090	7566335	I'm fighting so hard and many other women are fighting so hard to give a positive representation of girl gamers.
7566755	7571298	And if your house is directed to all you ladies that are out there that are doing this, stop.
7572159	7575060	Because we're fighting for the right type of gamers.
7575460	7578381	And if you're hurting us, you're an obstacle.
7578701	7583203	And to be honest, we will try everything possible to overrun it.
7583703	7589524	Because what you're doing is you're defeating us and you're contradicting what we're working so hard for.
7589565	7592165	There are people that are spending time, money, and effort.
7592185	7594626	There are women who are spending so much time, money, and effort.
7594866	7596547	And if you're out there, just please stop.
7597627	7600628	If you want to be sensual, if you want to be provocative, fine.
7601008	7602149	Do it without a controller.
7602189	7604551	Do it without saying that you're a girl gamer or a gamer girl.
7604831	7606533	Because you're putting us in a bad light.
7606973	7611657	And it's disrespectful, it's hurtful, and it's obnoxious.
7613218	7616080	Wow, like I said, those are some really powerful words.
7616601	7623807	So, for everyone that's out there watching, listening, where can they find more information about Girl Gamer VOG?
7624067	7626469	Well, we're at GGVOG, like G as in Gorilla.
7627062	7628924	GoGamingVogue.com or GoGamingVogue.
7628944	7633489	You can find us on Facebook, on Twitter, on Tumblr, on Instagram, on Flickr.
7634751	7637013	I forget what other place we're associated with.
7637574	7642579	By all means, we need more girls who are just as passionate and prominent that are looking for a place to call home.
7643841	7645643	Most of the people, if not all, probably like 99%,
7646964	7675605	they are very comfortable people you want to talk about games, by all means we're associated with a bunch of other communities as well, and if you want to play Call of Duty, Guild Wars you know, whatever it is, we'll find you a place to find people, to find girls that you can be best friends with and that's what we only want to be, we want to be good friends with you wow, that's pretty good, well Jen, thank you for your time thank you for having me, thanks for coming hey, no problem, at least we can do whatever we can do for you, we're here for you DJ Ron Ness, signing off
7681849	7691639	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio and thank you DJ Ranma S for that interview and especially Jen from Girl Gamer Vogue.
7691739	7692380	I like her.
7692700	7695483	She's really trying to do a good thing for the community.
7695864	7704052	I like when she was talking about educating people about the ESRB system and I really think and I hope everybody's listening to her when she talks about how...
7704753	7706474	DarkSakura.com
7729623	7735728	And I want to get our listeners thinking about this, because I really liked what just happened there.
7736008	7749638	I like that a listener kind of contributed that particular segment, and it gave us something to play on the show that we could actually put on the podcast that was interesting to listen to, and that was something a little different and listener-created.
7749758	7749978	So...
7750899	7759466	We want to try, come December or so forth, we would like to try opening up our breaks to listener-created content.
7760107	7766873	Now, that particular piece was a little bit long, but we're talking, think about something maybe a minute and a half to two minutes long.
7767433	7768494	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7789194	7795681	You won't be able to actually represent OLR and go get interviews and say, oh, my interview is going to be on OLR.
7795741	7798824	No, no, that's for myself, DarkSakura, and Loki to do.
7799305	7802928	But talk to us if you have some ideas along those lines.
7802988	7804210	We'll see what we can arrange.
7804890	7811117	If you're going to represent OLR, we have to make sure that you're not going to do something that could anger a potential guest or what have you.
7811577	7812978	So just be thinking about that.
7813018	7814800	We'll give you more details in the coming weeks.
7815220	7822066	But that's something we're hoping to do on the show is institute user-created content in our breaks.
7822666	7823307	So awesome.
7823327	7825629	And remember, I am Omega.
7828747	7832029	Damn, apparently the live listeners lost the feed for a moment while I was making that pitch.
7832109	7842135	But once again, we're looking at doing listener-created content during the breaks instead of music in little two-minute chunks or less for whatever community it is that you're passionate about.
7842315	7849980	After all, it's the show where every gamer has a voice, and I think we've been neglecting one big way to get your voices on the show.
7850780	7852962	Yeah, OLR reporters, OLR freelancers.
7853042	7854284	I'm loving those terms in chat.
7854424	7854824	Perfect.
7855365	7857527	So more information to come in the coming weeks.
7857587	7861290	That's something we want to implement in January or excuse me, December.
7862371	7865575	Meanwhile, let's get back into some rapid fire news.
7866055	7866856	Loki, start us off.
7867270	7867570	All right.
7868090	7868951	So let's see.
7869111	7872733	Let's talk a little bit about Black Ops 2 since that's going to be coming out this week.
7873133	7880757	One of the things that they just recently announced before they had the whole streaming that you can do of your gameplay with the league play and stuff like that.
7881197	7886200	Well, now it's been confirmed that that's going to be linked in with YouTube live streaming.
7886660	7892963	So you're going to be able to live stream on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and on the PC version as well.
7893483	7900247	No word on the Wii U yet because a lot of the integration that they have with Elite and stuff like that in the Wii U doesn't quite work, but it's pretty cool.
7900427	7908792	Also, I guess you're going to be able to see the player's gamer card of whoever you're streaming and some other additional information like class loadouts and stats and stuff like that.
7909452	7909872	It's pretty cool.
7909892	7914295	I actually did spot some of this stuff when I was doing the local play stuff.
7914835	7918898	They had some options for that, but really neat that you'll be able to livestream games.
7918918	7920939	I kind of wish they had that for Grand Theft Auto, but...
7921539	7922480	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7937955	7938255	It's neat.
7938375	7943177	Well, it's cool too because a lot of people don't have the hardware to like kind of video capture everything that they're doing.
7943217	7945778	So this is kind of built into the game, which I think is pretty cool.
7945798	7948520	Well, it's fascinating how the industry is really embracing it too.
7948620	7957424	I would have assumed there was going to be resistance to it, especially, you know, we talked about the Microsoft policy and all that stuff some time ago, you know, which is kind of this strange in the middle place.
7957464	7967308	But it is very interesting how, you know, instead of the game companies going to try and shut down places like Twitch TV and the other streaming sites, they're really saying, all right,
7967789	7971288	This is something people want to do It's a promotion for our game Let's do it
7971809	7971969	Yeah.
7972409	7973590	Now here's a weird promotion.
7973610	7983373	They're doing something with Halo 4 and their multiplayer where they're actually allowing players to get Microsoft points for playing multiplayer.
7983813	7984493	And here's how it works.
7984573	7993095	Okay, so basically if you get Halo 4 and you play 35 hours plus, and this is between launch until the end of this month.
7993275	7995196	So November 30th is a cutoff for it.
7995516	7999677	But if you play over 35 hours, you're going to get 100 Microsoft points.
7999697	8000398	Whoopee!
8001818	8002919	I know, whoopty shit.
8002999	8005942	Woo, a dollar and like 20 cents or something.
8006342	8009845	Okay, so then if you play $1.25, that's what it was.
8009865	8010306	70 hours, guess what?
8015751	8016512	You're gonna double that.
8017272	8018353	Or I'm sorry, you're gonna triple that.
8018533	8020555	You're gonna get 300 Microsoft points.
8021196	8025139	Yay, a denomination that totally doesn't round out anything.
8025259	8030384	So you're gonna have 300 Microsoft points possible there for you guys.
8031124	8036529	Also, if you happen to play over 140 hours... Was this only online multiplayer?
8036889	8055042	this is only online multiplayer Halo 4 matchmaking or custom or does it say it's multiplayer over Xbox Live so I could make a custom match set the timer to unlimited have it run all day have me and my friends set up a custom match have the timer run all day and I could do that right
8056559	8059080	I don't know if they'd let you do that.
8059180	8062962	It would be a big waste of time, but I suppose you could do that.
8063822	8068764	It's going to be up to 800 Microsoft points.
8068924	8072106	I'm kind of confused as to where they're going to get this 800 Microsoft points.
8073866	8074366	Oh, I'm sorry.
8074426	8080429	The extra 200 is coming from spending at least 3,000 Microsoft points on the Halo Marketplace content.
8082375	8086617	Woohoo, 200 points back after spending 3,000... So it's like a dinky $2 rebate.
8087457	8095940	Yeah, 3,000 Microsoft points, which is the equivalent of almost... What is that?
8095960	8095940	$40?
8097681	8098041	Almost?
8099621	8099981	I don't know.
8100882	8103243	All the point values are just... It's annoying.
8104623	8105644	So yeah, there you have it.
8105824	8107484	Some money back if you do that.
8107904	8108845	And I guess also if you...
8111710	8112131	I don't know.
8112311	8117056	If you spend, I guess, 1,500 Microsoft points, you get 100 Microsoft points back.
8118577	8120239	Fantastic, I guess.
8120900	8126045	But it is kind of neat, though, to see that you can earn some Microsoft points for playing a game for a long period of time.
8126626	8129589	YYR says it's more like a thank you to the people who are going to do it anyway.
8130249	8143175	I think it's just trying to get people to play a long time so that they can try to beat up Black Ops 2, which is probably going to dominate multiplayer and have it look nice when Halo 4 is at the top of the charts there, but it's going to be tough.
8145007	8149768	And last but not least, there's been a lot of information regarding Grand Theft Auto V coming out.
8150168	8153609	All of this coming from the brand new issue of Game Informer.
8154989	8172133	And a lot of details regarding kind of the single-player campaign, including, you know, first off, the game's map itself is going to be over... It's going to be bigger than Grand Theft Auto IV, San Andreas, and Red Dead Redemption combined.
8172413	8172933	It's just the...
8174053	8174814	That's a big map.
8193348	8194109	I don't remember.
8194469	8195509	Well, anyways, that's not important.
8196010	8197751	But three different people you get to play as.
8198051	8201813	Also, they're going to have some different locations available in the game.
8202313	8211139	Some of the stuff, obviously, you've seen in the trailers, including stuff based off of the vineyard areas.
8211679	8218403	Obviously, like Rockford Hills, which is like Beverly Hills, Blaine County, which is kind of like this desert.
8218924	8221005	They say they have bikers and meth heads in there.
8222506	8222906	Oh, goody.
8222946	8226209	Vespucci Beach, which is similar, I guess, to Venice Beach.
8227049	8228931	Also like some beachfronts and stuff like that.
8229331	8235616	They're saying also the game's going to have a salt and sea region, a military base, suburban hills.
8235976	8242381	There's a Mount Chiliad, I guess, which is a large wilderness area where you can explore all that.
8242621	8247945	They're also going to have underwater areas that you can scuba dive in and stuff like that.
8248985	8254468	They've got this brand new engine that has multi-mile draw distances in there.
8255029	8257790	I guess also you're going to be able to do all sorts of things.
8258411	8262073	They have a golf course that you can play a full round of golf in if you really want to.
8262233	8264114	Wow.
8264154	8265174	All sorts of details.
8266395	8268236	As long as I can beat people with my clubs.
8268776	8269837	That's the fun part.
8270277	8277863	Bowling, strip clubs, stand-up comedy acts, TV shows, internet cafes, kind of all similar to what they had before.
8277903	8281986	You can also, I guess, go to the gym, you can attend a sermon.
8282386	8288410	They've got yoga, triathlons that you can do, base jumping, tennis, jet skiing.
8289291	8293654	Also, they're getting rid of the romance stuff in there because that was fucking annoying.
8293934	8294595	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8312626	8328370	So, the three characters, Michael, who I guess is the guy who did the voiceover in the first trailer, he's a retired bank robber, and now he's kind of on the FIB, which, you know, the FBI Witness Protection Program, or he's, you know...
8329693	8330154	ReepoMan
8351514	8353415	But lots of screenshots.
8353455	8354495	Looks fantastic.
8354876	8358317	And new trailer going to be coming out on the 14th this week.
8358417	8360999	So very excited by that.
8361399	8365421	And this is definitely a game I'm highly, highly looking forward to.
8365461	8366121	No fanboy involved.
8366181	8366921	No, no, not at all.
8366941	8368182	Biggest game next year.
8368502	8371403	Alright, some rapid fire news for me.
8371823	8374724	Gamefly's digital PC client is now out.
8374824	8377185	It was in beta for a while, but it is now officially out.
8378165	8379705	You can download this if you're anybody.
8379725	8381606	You don't have to be a Gamefly subscriber to get it.
8381986	8382766	Anybody can have it.
8383486	8385287	Over 1,500 Windows and Mac titles.
8385307	8388468	This is sounding a little bit like a commercial, but it's been around on the game blogs.
8389628	8394290	If you are a member, you should be aware, because I know a lot of you guys are, you can do the whole unlimited PC play.
8394330	8395590	It's pretty much GameTap.
8397013	8397334	in a way.
8398074	8406022	Except I don't think it's a lot of the classic games, but more kind of like the games that are, you know, they're not super old, but they're old enough to not really be selling anymore.
8406642	8409505	Like Saints Row 2 is unlimited PC play, right?
8410025	8411146	So there you go.
8413769	8419454	Oh, apparently 2K Games giving everybody who downloads the client a free copy of Bioshock.
8419775	8421857	I don't know if that's still going, but it was going for a while.
8421877	8423458	It probably only was on the launch day.
8423478	8424259	It's probably done now.
8424679	8425059	But still.
8426300	8427561	I could just play that on PS3.
8427581	8429082	That is true.
8429242	8432465	Or a lot of folks bought the collection on Steam or what have you.
8433030	8435892	Anyhow, Xbox 360 USB data storage.
8436472	8437953	It was capped at 16 gigabytes.
8438033	8439714	I don't know if you know that for the USB storage.
8439734	8443696	They actually raised that in this recent update that happened.
8443716	8448198	It wasn't really out there, but it has been increased to 32 gigabytes.
8449158	8452440	So it has been confirmed with Microsoft that this was intentional.
8453741	8454321	So there you go.
8454401	8459604	That's great news for those folks that need to make way for data to install their Halo 4.
8460164	8461525	They should just not have a cap.
8462285	8469868	Oh, I understand they want to sell their overly expensive hard drives for these systems, but it shouldn't have a cap.
8470308	8487695	I mean, they're just selling these laptop SATA drives and charging a really huge premium on that stuff when I understand you can use external drives to supplement that, but only get 32 gigs of pop, whereas you can get a 2TB drive for half the price of their 320 drive.
8487715	8488095	So, why even bother?
8493024	8494185	Tia's Geek Cosplay Fuck
8509722	8533156	and I love that fuck is all in capital letters with an exclamation point and she dresses up as some of the various characters in Lollipop Chainsaw including like a giant chainsaw and you know she cosplays and it's actually all presumably fucks it's well that is true and it is it's all the same character it's just all of her alternate costumes from the game I see so I've if I remember correctly um
8534438	8538779	And judging by the back picture here, I don't think she dresses up like anybody else.
8538879	8545880	It's hard to tell because the pictures are really small, but I do notice that it's definitely a lot of the alternate costumes.
8546040	8550461	Although that one might be... No, no, no, that's still... Who cares?
8550561	8551641	Naked chick dressing up.
8551782	8552262	Exactly.
8552582	8553682	She's allowed to make some mistakes.
8553702	8555762	And she has a giant, really weird-looking chainsaw.
8555782	8557263	That has a heart at the end of it.
8557583	8558943	But that's from the game.
8559543	8561423	So there you go.
8561523	8563544	That chainsaw just looks really weird.
8563564	8563964	Cosplay fuck!
8566693	8567474	DarkSakura.
8567835	8568596	Try to follow that.
8570999	8574283	Well, I did get FinalFuck10 or X or whatever.
8574303	8577447	Remember Dance Dance Fuck.
8578088	8581813	Mental note, ask Eddie about Dance Dance Fuck next time he comes on the show.
8582734	8590237	Well, a little girl named Maya gets to play Legend of Zelda The Wind Waker as a girl.
8591097	8601261	Basically, her dad is developer Mike Hoy, who basically hex edited the game to replace all of the dialogue to be feminine in regards to Link's gender.
8601921	8605344	So instead of Swordman, it's Swordmane.
8605984	8608086	And M'lady instead of my lad and master.
8609206	8611908	And he's actually put the disc image up that you can play.
8613069	8614290	And it's pretty neat.
8614610	8615711	I think that's nice.
8615771	8620935	It's so his daughter can have an adventure that feels more believable to a little girl.
8621275	8629361	To be fair, he's not actually putting up the disc image because that would be piracy, but he's putting up the patch file that if you find this image with a certain MD5 hash, you can patch it.
8630313	8631714	Lollipop Chainsaw stars a girl.
8632155	8632575	Just saying.
8633496	8634817	Yeah, and the game was also awful.
8635297	8637039	That game is almost porn as it is.
8637599	8640682	It's pretty bad though, but it's just, yeah.
8640962	8643904	How old will Josh have to be before you let him play Lollipop Chainsaw?
8643944	8646707	I won't let him play it because it's really terrible.
8647127	8648288	It is a terrible game.
8648308	8649469	He doesn't get to play bad games.
8649529	8656215	I'll be like, dude, listen, if you're going to waste your time on a game, just go on the internet and watch porn because seriously, it's a better use of your time than playing this game.
8656915	8658877	I mean, this game is just lame.
8659217	8659638	Next story.
8659938	8660178	Yes.
8660919	8662580	The Angry Video Game Nerd.
8662620	8667725	Now, for anyone who's kept up with that Kickstarter, you know, there was Kickstarter to do a movie, and there's a trailer up.
8668405	8671448	I watched it yesterday, and I was like, really?
8673270	8673370	Ugh.
8675071	8676792	It looks like a bad 90s comedy.
8676872	8678433	I know, I'm going to watch it just for that.
8678953	8683435	But, I don't know, there were some parts that made me laugh, like the guy going, where the fuck is my arm?
8684615	8686096	Isn't that guy from something?
8686116	8693639	Because he looks like, was it the boss that they had in one of the Mega Man games where he had the tank body type thing?
8693659	8693819	Yeah.
8695150	8696031	Maybe, I don't know.
8696551	8699134	Maybe he's supposed to be a really screwed up American Dr. Wily.
8699374	8701356	It looks cheesy like that Gamers movie.
8701376	8707623	Remember, there's a lot of people who thought that Gamers movie was so awesome and then they made a sequel to it for God knows what reason.
8707643	8709264	It's probably because they made a lot of money off of it.
8710385	8712868	But yeah, it's whatever.
8712908	8713809	It's supposed to be cheesy.
8713869	8714510	People will buy it.
8715671	8717713	Or if it's a Kickstarter, he's going to make money from it.
8718749	8719469	and I'm done
8746188	8748501	Alright, let's get to the Fugle Question of the Week.
8757108	8761713	Every week we ask a question on our fan communities on Facebook and Google+.
8762053	8763575	Smoosh them together, you get Foogle.
8764196	8768701	So here it is, in honor of the fact that we talked a lot about music games tonight.
8769241	8778791	Our show was born of the music gaming community, but we know we've picked up a variety of listeners since our debut over 10 years ago and our shift to a general gaming show several years ago.
8779412	8781633	So what is your current thoughts on music gaming?
8782013	8783634	Is that a genre of game you are into?
8784054	8788016	Do you think it was a fad that has faded with the rise and fall of Guitar Hero in the States?
8788256	8789937	Or is the best yet to come?
8790477	8793599	Now, because our show is running a little long tonight, I'm going to keep this really short.
8793639	8803203	I'm only going to read a few of these answers, but I really encourage you guys to read the full responses on our Google Plus community, Orange Lounge Radio, and Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
8803824	8806485	Going to Google Plus, I'm going to read this one from Redertainment.
8807125	8810726	Like fashion, music, and my exercise group, things run in cycles.
8811266	8816228	Music gaming will have its comeback, then fizzle out, then comeback, then fizzle out again.
8816308	8818448	However, ABBA is forever.
8819449	8819929	Preach.
8820189	8821249	Of course you like that one.
8821269	8821589	Preach.
8822189	8823250	Of course I read that one.
8824530	8825951	How to get robbed to read your comment.
8826951	8828212	Nick M replies and said,
8843559	8850207	Technology, innovations, and creativity will allow music-driven games to make a huge revival, leaving the best to come.
8850688	8852850	Those are some answers from our Google Plus community.
8852891	8857937	Let's do a couple from Facebook over at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
8858638	8859919	Matt J. replied and said...
8860860	8862181	I love music gaming still.
8862542	8869288	My rock band library has grown to over 1700 songs and I'm playing almost every day that I can with a close group of friends.
8869728	8874072	It's been sad to see people leave the community, but I'm still able to find new people I haven't played with.
8874592	8881478	While my enthusiasm has died down significantly over the years, I'm still very much involved because of the social aspect, even online.
8881838	8884581	There's such a wonderful but small group of people playing
8884901	8885101	DJ Melvis
8900424	8905630	The popularity of music gaming now compared to 10 years ago is nearly night and day.
8906070	8912738	What propelled the music gaming crowd then was the gamer community who propelled it from a cult following to something mainstream.
8913238	8918043	Competitive tournaments, video footage of said tourneys, it was something people looked forward to and buzzed about.
8918544	8924028	Konami, in America, failed to capitalize on that momentum and assumed the fans would eat up anything they put out.
8924528	8928070	Instead of working with and cultivating their fan base, they turned a blind eye to them.
8928531	8930732	That ultimately killed a majority of their following.
8930872	8936216	Combine that with the demise of arcade gaming in America, the tournament scene died and the community grew further apart.
8936836	8939398	Rock Band is pretty much music gaming's last stand.
8939978	8946447	At least they nailed the whole microtransaction process with DLC, and events like Umlaut validate its popularity.
8946868	8948030	Go Harmonix!
8948450	8951435	Good plug for Umlaut, by the way, which is coming up real soon.
8952273	8952893	Tell me about it.
8956115	8956615	Let's see.
8956795	8958336	I'll do one more here from Facebook.
8958376	8961377	Again, I'm really sorry I'm limiting this tonight, but we're just running a long night.
8962117	8964558	Chiggers replies and says, I've been saying the same thing.
8978104	8996877	I wonder too if they could do something like Trumpet Smith or Sitar Smith I do think they need to somehow incorporate music theory into some of the games though too Sure it's fun to play some of your favorite songs by memory but you can't pick up the guitar and read music and play something that's not on the game For the record there has been Sitar Hero That was a joke though right?
8997257	9003421	That was on the Austin Powers 3 website as a flash game but it did exist
9004105	9004908	Very interesting.
9005008	9009000	Was it Austin Powers 3 or was it The Love Guru?
9009060	9011026	It was The Love Guru, that was right, yeah.
9012313	9013634	Everybody forgot about that game.
9013834	9015696	Everybody should forget about that movie.
9016657	9017617	So there you go.
9018438	9019979	Quickly, I'll go around the room.
9020039	9021901	What's your current thoughts on music gaming?
9023062	9024623	I think it'll always have a niche.
9024683	9027686	We have to remember it didn't really start with DDR or Beatmania.
9027866	9029607	It was Dance Aerobics.
9031008	9040156	But I think games, especially in America, games like Parappa the Rapper, and I know I loved Busta Groove or whatever they called it over here.
9040578	9041719	We need to totally break that out.
9042199	9042399	What?
9042719	9044080	Oh, I know, but it was a great game.
9044440	9048863	So, I mean, I kind of feel like there were games before, and there will still be games in the future.
9049403	9054567	I think it, kind of like that first comment I read, where like, it comes, it goes, it comes, it goes.
9055127	9057028	I think that's kind of how I feel.
9057188	9058109	Loki, DarkSakura?
9058149	9060290	Now the facts of life theme is stuck in my head.
9060330	9061851	You take the good, you take the bad.
9062231	9062612	No.
9063212	9063352	Loki?
9066174	9077123	I love music games, so I don't really... I think it's going to just kind of right now coast along with a lot of the dancing franchises with Just Dance and Dance Central and that kind of stuff.
9078084	9087391	Maybe with the new systems, they'll find new ways to kind of incorporate whatever type of peripherals that they have into it, like with the Wii U tablet or something like that.
9087411	9088252	Yeah.
9089853	9107602	I just, you know, I hope it doesn't, I assume it's just going to keep, you know, staying around for a while because you still have, you know, a niche audience that's really into it and sometimes that's all it takes is just a niche audience because, I mean, look at a lot of the Atlas products and stuff like that that don't sell millions of copies and you have dozens and dozens of sequels.
9109989	9115531	All right, let's move on with some more news, and then we'll get to the mailbag and some quick calls tonight.
9115751	9116792	So, Loki.
9117392	9117712	All right.
9118252	9123715	So let's talk a little bit about some really weird patents.
9124195	9139461	And Microsoft has one now that it's basically this kind of DRM system that's going to use a Kinect-like camera to basically monitor the number of users that are watching a display of a certain performance or content or whatever.
9140462	9148699	and basically tracking the faces of those viewers to see if they have appropriately licensed it.
9148779	9149561	So, for example...
9151385	9168463	I mean, it sounds kind of stupid, but let's say I rented a movie or something like that, and then I have to go to the bathroom, and I leave that the movie would stop or something because I'm no longer in the room, and it's like, oh, shit, the person that registered this content is no longer in the room.
9168944	9171126	I mean, that sounds a little ridiculous, but
9173247	9176008	I don't know if this is necessarily going to be something that they do.
9176028	9181849	It mentions, I guess, gaming and gaming media, also mobile devices.
9182749	9197413	Maybe my thought is that it's like your computer will lock... I mean, they have it right now already with some of those biometric sensors and stuff, but maybe it's something where your computer will lock down if it doesn't recognize you.
9197833	9200734	Although, that's going to suck if you get in a car accident and your face gets disfigured, but...
9202195	9208139	Or, you know, I know a lot of the live listeners are complaining that the OLR feed is going up What did they say?
9208760	9226333	Ragenator said, OLR is going down faster and more frequently than White House interns when Clinton was in office Well, you know, I like to grow and shave a beard pretty frequently as well I like having a beard, but then I'll shave it when I have to do Rocky or something An onstage part that requires me to shave it
9226693	9230137	So, you know, how's the Kinect going to pick that up?
9230157	9230698	Let me put it this way.
9230778	9232120	It's not that sophisticated.
9232140	9238588	It's basically looking at facial geometry, like, you know, the proportions between, you know, space between your eyes.
9238608	9241131	So the, you know, bone structure and that kind of stuff.
9241171	9244435	It's like, okay, your face is this wide, your eyes are this far apart.
9244475	9245917	Yeah, but that technology is not going to work.
9246397	9247117	That's the problem.
9248138	9252520	The Kinect was supposed to do all this stuff and it doesn't really work in the real world.
9252600	9263485	And who really likes signing into Xbox Live by staring at the Kinect for like 30 seconds or hitting A and signing in right away?
9263965	9269508	I really hope this technology is only being patented to harness it so that nobody can ever use it.
9270288	9271849	That is my real true hope.
9272009	9273270	But I'm not going to hold my breath.
9275959	9276359	We'll see.
9278341	9283204	We had news earlier in the year that Nintendo Power was going to be having its last issue ever.
9283464	9284785	And guess what?
9285285	9288367	PlayStation, the official magazine, following right behind.
9288728	9295012	The holiday 2012 issue will be the last issue of the official, or excuse me, PlayStation, the official magazine.
9296333	9301876	That is not long after Future US, who also published Nintendo Power, announced that shutdown.
9302317	9304898	So, bye-bye, magazines.
9305939	9306820	Going bye-bye.
9307320	9308821	There's two out the door.
9310042	9315387	It's unfortunate we don't have like a iPad version of it or something that lives on.
9315467	9316107	I don't know.
9316468	9316748	Maybe.
9317208	9321672	It makes me very depressed because print is beautiful and ink smells good.
9322152	9325835	I know, but well, what do you think can be done to save this dying industry?
9325855	9326936	We still have play, don't we?
9328396	9329077	I think so.
9329237	9330398	I love that magazine.
9330799	9331800	Play better not go anywhere.
9332521	9339368	But what would, I mean, do you think this is something that could make a renaissance someday?
9339489	9341511	Or is this just done because of technology?
9341531	9342512	Well, we get EGM again, right?
9343073	9344694	Yeah.
9344775	9346336	Is this just done because of tablets?
9346456	9347738	I know you don't like to think about it, but...
9349136	9349737	It's a shift.
9349837	9352760	Somebody's gotta design the tablet document if we go there.
9369235	9369975	Speak for yourself.
9393567	9400331	Well, here's something like, you know, the whole shift from digital or from print to digital.
9400431	9402452	Game Informer has a digital version.
9403232	9406594	How did they get me to switch over to the digital version from print?
9407935	9413158	The Grand Theft Auto information came out this week on the digital version and two weeks later on print.
9413378	9415279	So I went, I want the digital version.
9416740	9417920	And so that's what it is.
9417940	9418701	It doesn't matter.
9418721	9420942	Anyways, I thumbed through it once and then I put it aside.
9421042	9422823	So and then I throw them away months later.
9423303	9424464	Loki brings up a good point.
9424584	9431430	Is it that need-to-know-right-now mentality, especially in the gaming culture, that might be hurting magazines a little bit?
9431450	9432091	Well, yeah.
9432151	9432932	And here's the thing, too.
9432972	9433913	It probably doesn't help.
9434093	9438176	Is that, you know, all that Grand Theft Auto information, immediately, as soon as it hit...
9439157	9445720	The digital version, it hit the NeoGAF forums and then it hit all the blogs and it hit all the websites.
9445920	9452524	So even if you didn't subscribe to that magazine, unless you wanted to read the article by yourself, you got all the information that was right there.
9453564	9456005	To wait for it to be in print is just ridiculous.
9456165	9456906	Why would you do that?
9457966	9461787	I mean, other than appreciating the art of printing and all that stuff.
9462348	9463828	And pretty pictures to look at.
9463988	9470731	But there's nothing, now that you have digital versions, there's really nothing that's exclusive anymore to them, momentarily at least.
9473124	9480109	Hell, let's be honest, it took them a day or two to get my digital version converted over.
9481149	9490895	I looked at screen caps because you can do screen caps on your iPod or iPhone or on your iPad and I looked at screen caps of the whole articles.
9491035	9493977	I didn't even need the digital version to read that stuff.
9496038	9497019	Yeah, it's kind of...
9499676	9500116	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9519568	9528630	Well, this is, as soon as it works, this is an old format that had a game released in 2010.
9530171	9531751	Have you ever heard of Pure Solar?
9532991	9537052	It was released in 2010 for the Sega Mega Drive, or as we know it, the Genesis.
9538033	9541934	And it's like a 64 megabyte cartridge.
9542034	9543294	It was huge.
9544474	9546075	It was very well received.
9546616	9558523	Now the group Watermelon, the developer, has a Kickstarter to release an HD version to come out for Xbox 360, PC, Mac, Linux, and Dreamcast.
9558643	9563906	The game already has over 50 hours of gameplay, 300 locations, and 800 NPCs.
9566207	9571771	I actually watched the little interview on here and it looks pretty neat.
9572952	9586963	If you pledge $15 you'll receive a copy of the game when it's released for whatever platform you wish and $45 get a limited edition 4 CD copy of the soundtrack or a digital bundle consisting of the game
9587883	9594985	on Xbox 360, PC, Mac, Linux, one of the three, as well as a digital copy of the soundtrack.
9595025	9596545	There's also a limited edition for $125.
9596585	9609028	There's a hard copy of the game for either Dreamcast or PC, Mac, Linux, and the Pierce Solar Guidebook signed lithograph and three figurines.
9609568	9622015	there's only going to be 250 of them produced and as of when I was reading this there were just under 100 pre-ordered this actually might be the first one I put money into the game looks awesome
9626144	9638373	and there were the $999 Kickstarter exclusive Dreamcast ones have already been ordered.
9638453	9642296	So they are currently at $76,468 out of their $139,000 goal and they have 26 days to go.
9642316	9643697	So I want this and I think everyone should check it out.
9643717	9643797	Bye.
9653505	9657010	Alright, just a few more stories then we'll get to the mailbag and the FUs of the week
9661167	9676737	Alright, so I think we talked about this before, but there was some whole controversy about the Navy SEALs actually helping the developers of Medal of Honor Warfighter with some of the details of the game and stuff like that.
9677537	9688904	And it probably doesn't help that they have the whole DLC tying in with that movie Zero Dark Thirty, which is about the whole SEAL Team Six infiltrating Osama Bin Laden's camp and stuff like that.
9690760	9703237	So anyways, apparently seven SEALs so far have received letters of reprimand, effectively denying them of promotion and also docking them half of their salaries for two months.
9705880	9731837	which you know obviously they're probably getting paid by EA anyways but um but yeah so that's I don't know I guess four of the seven are affected are still engaging in active duty and are still under investigation but um that kind of sucks but then again if you're in the military and you're revealing military secrets to a game company it's kind of a problem
9736010	9736330	Right, right.
9764721	9770085	How historically accurate is too historically accurate, especially when it's so recent, you know?
9771526	9773787	Well, moving on to something completely different.
9774187	9777710	Capcom is apparently going to be hiring 1,000 people.
9777750	9779231	That's pretty cool.
9779511	9785575	1,000 people over the course of 10 years, but that would be adding to the 1,500 game developers that are on staff currently.
9786495	9793400	This is a Capcom representative saying, quote, "...we want to further improve the quality of our games by maintaining an internal game development team."
9794460	9799183	The purpose of increasing our game developer team is to create a larger percentage of our games internally.
9799644	9808109	Therefore, we believe that there will be no significant change in total development expenditures, mainly because we will be shifting outsourced operations to our own workforce.
9808749	9814493	That's pretty neat because there's a lot of that outsourcing that goes on in the gaming industry as well.
9814573	9821037	For all the Capcom is evil chats that go on, and certainly they've made some pretty shitty decisions over the past couple of years, let's be real.
9822378	9826580	This is pretty cool that they are going to be bringing a lot of jobs back.
9827721	9830803	Do notice, though, that that doesn't necessarily mean it's a thousand jobs here.
9831023	9832624	It's probably a thousand jobs in Japan.
9833044	9841889	But, you know, still more internally developed games, I think, means they can kind of keep a closer eye on things and hopefully get some better products.
9841969	9842409	We'll see.
9844551	9844971	Interesting.
9846966	9876358	so Capcom sounds like they're almost it's almost double but not quite so alright well let's get to our mailbag segment every week you guys send us emails mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com and we read some of our favorites here on the air DarkSakura why don't you dive into the mailbag head first and read some emails for us just three just three first of all this one's a little long but I'll try to get through it quickly
9876803	9878364	Hey OLR, AZHP here.
9878444	9883907	I heard you guys talk about Rhode Island suing 38 Studios for $75 million, basically assuming that Rhode Island was in the right for a lawsuit.
9884527	9887749	It seemed like there were some assumptions being made, so I wanted to clear up some misconceptions.
9888229	9892171	The lawsuit is not as straightforward as 38 Studios didn't put out a game and we want our money.
9892911	9898054	38 Studios declared bankruptcy, which typically prevents a company from being pursued by creditors, in this case the state of Rhode Island.
9898434	9905836	However, Rhode Island's suit claims that 38 Studios and Kirch Schilling misled Rhode Island as to the difficulties involved with putting out an MMO.
9906196	9910457	And because Rhode Island was misled, $75 million was loaned in poor trust and should be repaid.
9911237	9913018	There's another misconception I wanted to clear up.
9913198	9922180	Rhode Island approached 38 Studios promising the $75 million loan and tax breaks if 38 Studios would move their operation to Rhode Island in the first place.
9922460	9924681	Basically, they wanted 38 Studios to come to Rhode Island.
9925541	9939919	This is basically like a bank saying, hey, we'll give you a good deal on a loan to buy a house, lending you the money, you losing your job, going bankrupt and foreclosing due to unforeseen circumstances, and the bank saying, whoa, whoa, whoa, you didn't tell me there was a possibility you would lose your job, we want our money back, and we're going to take your house.
9941537	9945298	As you guys can see, it's not as clear cut that Rhode Island deserves any money at all.
9945759	9949640	If you make an investment and it doesn't pay off, in my opinion, you should go suck it up and take your lumps.
9950060	9951941	But try telling that to the governor of Rhode Island.
9951981	9955662	Just my two cents on the matter is HPOLR's premier gold star recipient.
9956435	9964082	I think that's a good point that he brings up, is that Rhode Island did... I thought we kind of touched on this a little bit last week, and I'm going to say it again now.
9965343	9968666	Why was it so goddamn important that they get this guy in the first place?
9969367	9977354	Remember, I mentioned last week, were we blinded by our sports culture, where we hold these sportsmen that do so well in such high regard...
9979095	9981676	Was that really Rhode Island's mistake, possibly?
9982016	9985656	And yeah, if that was their mistake, then they in turn need to pay for that.
9986276	9986957	You know, I don't know.
9987037	9995598	But like some of our chatters were saying last week, you know, I say all this, you know, and I know it sounds really cold and really mean and that I'm like anti-sport.
9995778	9996138	I'm not.
9996238	9997219	I'm not any of those things.
9997339	9997879	I am.
9997899	9998599	I'm kidding.
9999099	10004200	And I think Curt Schilling and all them meant well, but...
10006342	10008265	I would like to do a lot of things.
10008305	10013273	Are you going to give me $75 million because I mean well and I have good intentions and some real good ideas?
10015156	10015857	Probably not.
10016858	10018461	You're going to expect to see some things.
10019021	10019582	You know, I just...
10021496	10024738	Persona 4 Arena will not make it to Europe this year.
10044873	10045734	I heard about that.
10045774	10048717	You guys got screwed because that's the region locked one, huh?
10049377	10050318	That is so messed up.
10050358	10052700	And people wondered why we bitched about it being region locked.
10052881	10061528	As a pretty big Shin Megami Tensei fan, I was really looking forward to this game and we still have no idea when it will be released, only that it won't be this year.
10061669	10061989	Sigh.
10064371	10064892	Oh, bless you.
10065372	10066353	You guys got hosed.
10067294	10068395	That's really unfortunate.
10070427	10075929	I really don't know what else to say except that, you know, I wouldn't fault you for pirating it at that point.
10077030	10078470	I'm not supposed to encourage that.
10078590	10080631	You can't really if it's region locked.
10080971	10081631	I mean, you can.
10081711	10084913	Are you suggesting that people can't work around that?
10085253	10090555	Well, you can, but you need a JTAG system on Xbox 360 or a recent glitch hack system.
10090595	10091475	That's what I thought.
10093436	10096277	And the last email comes from your boyfriend.
10098362	10099022	Loki's boyfriend?
10099203	10099243	No.
10099283	10099643	I'm just kidding.
10101104	10101704	Yes, Loki's boyfriend.
10101724	10102745	Come on, that was too easy.
10102765	10103645	That was too easy.
10103826	10104106	All right, yes.
10104126	10105106	Yes, Loki's boyfriend.
10105267	10105607	All right.
10105647	10105927	Hi, Alan.
10105947	10106707	I have no boyfriends.
10106848	10107448	I know you don't.
10107508	10109849	Hi, Alan.
10109910	10112831	This question is for DarkSakura, and it's related to Mass Effect 2, my favorite.
10114172	10127607	The upcoming Omega DLC looks pretty rad, but starting with ME3 proper, Bioware made some really glaring weird sexist mistakes with both InfemShep's handling, as well as her relationship, soiling Caden for a lot of shippers who don't give a fuck about dudeship.
10128067	10128588	Me included.
10130427	10137755	Thanks to this, many in the fandom have joked that the female versions of Mass Effect aliens will end up being maleface plus bad perm plus stocked to its armor.
10139337	10151129	My question is, how do you feel about Nareen having proper separated breasts in screenshots instead of just a larger breastplate region in her robe, considering that Turians are clearly supposed to be avian, reptilian, or both?
10151830	10154712	I'm not asking if you're offended personally, though if you are, let it out.
10155292	10159916	But from a design perspective, since they otherwise did a good job on her face and head detailing.
10160316	10161096	And that's from Ellen.
10162857	10164659	First of all, I actually didn't notice she had boobs.
10165439	10167000	I thought she just had plating.
10168021	10171263	Or maybe like a kind of segmented chest plate type of thing.
10172084	10178288	Because, and I didn't even really think to look, because of cut dialogue in Mass Effect 2.
10179308	10180990	And that's what I linked to earlier.
10182551	10183232	Did I want it to play?
10184273	10184873	Oh, yeah, sure.
10185774	10187936	You're looking at me like, what?
10188817	10189738	Yes, keep talking.
10190038	10191260	Hold on, what am I playing here?
10191600	10195264	It's the groundskeeper on the Citadel in Mass Effect 2.
10198988	10199948	Good evening, human.
10200449	10201469	It is evening, isn't it?
10202009	10204330	Without day and night, I lose track.
10204731	10206771	I shipped in from Palavin last month.
10207112	10208412	I'm still getting my bearings.
10208812	10212594	You'd be surprised how much a trained horticulturalist can earn here.
10212954	10216656	The nicest thing about being on the Citadel has to be the drinks.
10217176	10221781	You might not believe it, but my species hasn't invented many intoxicants.
10222241	10227066	I'm constantly amazed by human creativity when it comes to brewing and distilling.
10227087	10229529	You ever had aquarium thruster fuel?
10229970	10232012	Must be 99% alcohol.
10232452	10234915	I think they distill it from raw antimatter.
10235535	10237097	Antimatter alcohol.
10237477	10238759	Excuse me for asking, but...
10239179	10240500	You're a female, right?
10241080	10243742	You got those funny bumps, like an Asari.
10244122	10247144	Every time I come in here, some Asari asks me to dance.
10247545	10249546	First of all, Turians don't dance.
10250026	10253669	Second of all, Asari have those funny bumps that get in the way.
10254849	10256370	That's what I'm trying to get to.
10258391	10259671	That was cut dialogue.
10260131	10265234	Basically, you know where you go talk to him after the croak and ask if there's fish in the reservoir?
10265674	10267254	That was cut dialogue from him.
10267615	10269615	You got some funny bumps, DarkSakura.
10269795	10270396	Shut up.
10270416	10273297	Those are some big bumps.
10274777	10275318	Shut up.
10277045	10279766	You know, I actually did have a kitten stand on my boobs yesterday.
10280206	10280587	Did you?
10281087	10284948	My friend drugged me to PetSmart and I was close to throwing down 60 bucks for this kitten.
10284988	10288570	He goes, this reminds me of Shermie, but that wouldn't be fair to Shermie's memory.
10288970	10291111	But yeah, the kitten passed the standing on boobs test.
10291789	10293831	Just stood there and then curled up and purred.
10294012	10295193	I'm like, okay, I have to hold you.
10295773	10297435	But yeah, back to Mass Effect.
10299037	10300238	So I actually didn't even look.
10300299	10302981	And I have some of the comics.
10303082	10310870	I didn't read some of... I looked at pictures of what the female Turians looked like in some of those comics.
10311091	10312012	And I had the...
10314013	10314734	Yeah, oh my god.
10316015	10320921	I'm sorry for... She doesn't look like super endowed.
10321061	10325246	It's not like overly sexualized, I think, is important to keep in mind.
10325306	10327088	It's not like she's got some tiggle bitties.
10327528	10329591	You know, it's just like, okay, she's got some funny bumps.
10330071	10330671	That's it.
10330711	10331571	Yeah, it's not nothing.
10331971	10332691	It looks like it.
10332872	10336952	I mean, they kind of look flattish, like more like an extended rib cage.
10337552	10337772	Yeah.
10338253	10342533	Well, I mean, in general, I think Turian rib cage is supposed to be really high if you ever looked at the naked model.
10342593	10344454	It's a fucking alien race.
10344534	10349455	Why are we so, like in a fake video game, it's a fake alien race.
10349495	10352215	Like, why are we so like, oh, but it's not lizard accurate.
10352255	10353895	Well, it's not a fucking lizard.
10353915	10356196	Those are the worst breasts I've seen on a lizard yet.
10357316	10363601	Well, I mean, my point was it's not something I noticed because, first of all, I didn't really see evidence of it in the comics.
10364462	10366043	And there was that cut dialogue.
10366143	10367664	I didn't think to look for boobs.
10368325	10371447	You know, I was like, okay, Turian chicks don't have boobs.
10371547	10372548	Good for them.
10372708	10375210	They probably regurgitate to feed their young.
10375690	10378893	If they're based off of birds or lizards, then that's kind of gross, but...
10379415	10385939	Alan is in our chat room right now and says, it's more of an issue that they are hard and rough and scaly, but suddenly soft jubilees.
10386460	10389201	How do you know those aren't some rough, scaly boobs?
10389321	10393124	How do you know they're not all like... How do you know those aren't the slimiest tits you'll ever see?
10393164	10394845	Remember Morden and his chafing?
10395706	10397046	We'll prescribe analgesics.
10397347	10398087	May cause chafing.
10399048	10406513	But... But... I think that it's not so much of a big deal.
10406633	10406993	I think...
10408962	10414245	I may feel differently when I actually play it and see them in action, see if they bounce.
10414866	10417247	But it didn't look like boob boobs, you know?
10417647	10420769	It just looked like a hint of boob.
10420909	10422510	Alan in chat is apologizing.
10422590	10423471	Sorry I asked.
10423531	10424551	I thought it was interesting.
10424611	10425792	No, it is.
10425892	10427173	I'm yelling at the internet.
10427213	10428514	I'm not yelling at you.
10428654	10429574	I would never yell at you.
10429675	10432696	I cannot wait, by the way, to play through Omega with FemShep.
10433557	10435038	With Team Badass Bitch.
10436038	10436799	Because Aria...
10437639	10460468	Don't fuck with Arya Yeah, Omega has one rule Don't fuck with Arya That's my rule too Don't fuck with me Good times Yeah, and Tigerclaw is right Javik did call Salarians lizard people And also said that Raw Salarian liver is a delicacy And that they used to eat flies
10461249	10463111	Alright, let's get... Is that it for emails?
10463531	10463991	Yes, it is.
10464131	10465813	Let's get to the FUs of the week.
10465913	10468375	Every week we rant on this show because we can.
10487197	10497242	I have a huge FU that goes to a condition called angular chelitis, which some people can use for cold sores or canker sores.
10497362	10504965	What they are is when you get a lesion in the corner of your mouth that forms kind of a pussy scab, and it happens to lots of people.
10505345	10508527	But the thing that I hate about it, I mean, you know, yeah, this happened.
10508607	10513149	It happens from a vitamin deficiency and basically a lot of stress.
10513949	10521561	But what I hate is waking up in the morning and having to yawn and forgetting all about it and then just it hurt really bad.
10521961	10524625	And also drivers in the parking lot at Whole Foods.
10525446	10526748	Screw all of you entitled rich people.
10528436	10530938	Loki, fuck you to Ford in my car.
10531538	10534961	He's breaking.
10535041	10551692	Last time I took it in to get repaired, which was about $1,200 for repairs, I think, with a bunch of stuff, and then it broke down a month later, the guy there, who had this really weird growth on his face, said, oh yeah, I've seen those cars last for 300,000 miles.
10551892	10554975	Yeah, after you replace every goddamn part in the car,
10556035	10557016	Four times!
10557756	10559137	It's probably lasted that long.
10559197	10561939	But then again, it's not the original car anymore, now is it?
10563199	10563539	That's it.
10564640	10567301	If you want to know my FU of the week, refer to the top of the show.
10568062	10569303	It was kind of a shitty weekend.
10569843	10571444	I don't want to go back to work tomorrow.
10573905	10574846	But I guess we have to make money.
10575766	10577968	Alright, a couple more news stories for you guys.
10577988	10581532	Then we'll open up the Skype line quickly at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
10581552	10582373	I emphasize quickly.
10582393	10585836	We might only do one or two calls tonight, depending on who all tries to get in.
10586697	10587618	And of course, Twitter topics.
10587638	10588879	We'll get through as many of those as we can.
10588919	10590101	Twitter.com slash OLR.
10590241	10590481	Loki.
10591142	10596507	So, Silicon Knights, you remember they were suing Epic Games over the whole, you know...
10597160	10600123	Oh, Unreal 3 is so hard to use.
10600543	10603206	And they made our game shit.
10603686	10606929	Not because we suck or anything, but they lost.
10607729	10608030	Boop.
10609271	10618679	So, on top of that, not only did they lose, but the new ruling, I guess, doubled the damages from 4.5 million to 9 million.
10620540	10630585	And on top of that, they also have to destroy any games that they have, any unsold games that they have using the Unreal 3 engine.
10632326	10634747	So, I don't know.
10635508	10646213	So I guess that means Two Human, X-Men, Destiny, Siren in Maelstorm, The Sandman, and The Box slash Ritualist.
10650050	10652291	All these games I was a really big fan of.
10653152	10658535	So if they're destroying all these games, would that mean that they have to... They're going in a landfill.
10659235	10662317	By destroying, does that mean that they just get to work on them a little bit longer?
10668340	10670582	That's what you get when you place the blame on somebody else.
10671962	10674744	Really, it was just your inept ability to program these games.
10677156	10684342	All right, well, one more story for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10684683	10686765	This is a story about Charles Huang.
10686805	10690288	If you don't know that name, you probably know something he co-created.
10690328	10691529	It's Guitar Hero.
10692089	10693210	Well, what's he doing now?
10693290	10696733	Is he doing another music game or doing something else with gaming?
10697314	10698175	Not exactly.
10698835	10703837	It's called Green Throttle Games is the company he's working on.
10704717	10707458	It's a mobile to TV app and controller.
10707578	10715960	What it's trying to do is turning smartphone games into a big screen experience by connecting a mobile device directly to an HDTV.
10716580	10722462	This will be playable on wireless, Bluetooth controllers via what's called the Green Throttle Arena app.
10722942	10729325	In other words, I think it's a great idea, but Apple could knock this out of business in a heartbeat.
10729745	10731506	It's a dangerous territory, I think.
10731766	10736989	Because a lot of people have been saying Apple TV is only moments away from doing something like this.
10737389	10738390	I don't know.
10738670	10741251	That's all fan wank, and Apple hasn't done it.
10741531	10742752	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10762993	10763614	Thanks for watching!
10778502	10788748	like a DualShock 3 controller or a Wii Remote with the Classic Controller Pro or something like that tied in with it.
10789129	10796113	They have a lot of games that do support these things and with a TV out cable, you can do this already.
10796473	10803057	But they're wrapping in a nice package, I guess, so that it's easy for consumers to find all the games that support this controller.
10803197	10806539	and it's important to note they are also developing their own games in-house.
10807119	10814543	So, you know, even if Apple were to push a button and really fuck this idea over, they'd still have, hopefully, some solid games to fall back on.
10814563	10816344	I'm surprised they haven't done anything like that.
10816584	10823268	And, to be fair, I want to throw this out here to give this whole thing a break because I don't want to sound like I'm poo-pooing the idea because I'm not.
10823748	10827110	I would love to be able to play smartphone games on the TV.
10827170	10829151	There's a lot I would like to be able to do that with.
10829851	10829911	Um...
10831212	10834134	But, um, that's my train of thought.
10834154	10834874	Where was I going with this?
10835535	10838537	The, um, Radio Guy's Worst Enemy.
10838597	10839017	Antarctica.
10839397	10840318	Derailed Train.
10840358	10840638	Penguins.
10840658	10843840	I think a lot of the games also, it seems like a lot of them are touch-based.
10843960	10848563	Well, not necessarily the games that they're pitching, but like, you know, like Angry Birds and stuff like that.
10848803	10849564	I know what I was going to say.
10850605	10857249	Open Feint is like an Apple, or is an iOS thing that a lot of gaming companies use.
10857629	10860070	to plug into their games to do online leaderboards and so forth.
10860390	10867532	Game Center hasn't put that out of business because OpenFaint, I guess, offers either it's easier to implement or it's a richer package.
10867592	10868393	It's multi-platform.
10868673	10870033	Multi-platform as well.
10870753	10872474	So who knows?
10872734	10878156	Green Throttle could go multi-platform too, I would think, hypothetically, with Android tablets or whatever.
10878476	10892125	I'm thinking even if they did something like that where Apple TV or whatever had some sort of Bluetooth support, which I honestly, I'm surprised that that device doesn't have Bluetooth support, the whole Apple TV.
10892325	10900271	What they could do, which would be interesting, is have, if you have an Apple TV, because doesn't the Apple TV support streaming?
10900471	10905654	You can content stream stuff from your iPod or iPad to the TV.
10905694	10908216	Maybe say you content stream something,
10908756	10927092	to the TV, and then you use a Bluetooth controller with that, and then you can basically use the iPad or iPod or iPhone device as like a tether, almost like using the Wii Classic Controller or Classic Controller Pro with the Wii.
10927152	10930475	You have to use the Wii Remote as kind of like the Bluetooth tether to that.
10930715	10930855	Mm-hmm.
10933726	10940429	All right, well, we're going to move on to the Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10940509	10942289	It is open for business now.
10942569	10951833	In the meantime, we'll get some last-minute stories, and I want to do some Twitter topics as well, things that were sent in to twitter.com slash OLR.
10952913	10954354	I want to do this one first.
10954414	10957115	This is from, damn it, come on, load.
10957375	10957675	Here we go.
10958275	10959656	This one's from Actdeft.
10960436	10962999	Give a listen to the Wii U menu music.
10963239	10965121	It's really good and entrancing.
10966123	10968205	I did not know that this was out but apparently here it is.
10979917	10980737	Here's the thing though.
10981177	10994642	I want to go into skeptic mode here because I noticed that the YouTube here has a link to a website where it says full album available and then it says check out more Wii U music and news at such and such website and it's not an official Nintendo site either.
10994682	11003244	Now I'm not saying maybe these guys didn't get a Wii U somehow but I'm always kind of curious when it's this much blatant like go here, go to this site.
11003344	11004345	I don't know.
11004405	11004905	I'm just saying.
11005025	11005425	I'm just saying.
11006445	11008946	But, um... Could be legit.
11010327	11010827	What do you think?
11010887	11011487	Is this it?
11011547	11012187	Is this the real deal?
11012267	11013508	It sounds pretty Nintendo-y.
11013668	11014968	It does sound a little pretty Nintendo-y.
11015008	11015489	I believe it.
11016669	11018990	Um... Yeah, I'm not sure.
11019550	11020851	We'll know within days.
11021991	11025533	Because those things are going to be out very, very, very soon.
11026733	11027293	Let's go to phones.
11028174	11029054	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
11029074	11029414	Who's this?
11030515	11031495	Hey, so we're Nate.
11031615	11032315	How's it going?
11032415	11032936	Hey, good.
11032956	11033596	How are you, Nate?
11034683	11035284	Going good.
11035344	11040650	I listened to all y'all talks about vaporware and green throttle and Wii U music.
11041091	11046557	I just wanted to ask you all who you think is going to win the upcoming console war.
11047472	11049714	Who's going to win the upcoming console war?
11050254	11052616	And to answer your question whether that was legit or not, yes, it is.
11052696	11054578	And they actually have more menu music.
11054738	11061584	Because Kotaku, they have their own Wii U thing, and they wouldn't post a story like that if it was completely wrong.
11061604	11064206	Because they have a Wii U to compare that to.
11064266	11064546	I see.
11064586	11066027	Okay, thank you for that clarification.
11066087	11068229	I'm just always a little skeptical when it's the internet.
11068249	11068890	Always a little skeptical.
11069270	11070050	All right, so Nate's...
11070851	11071872	Loaded question.
11071912	11072292	No, I'm kidding.
11072312	11073033	It's not a loaded question.
11073093	11073814	It's a tough question.
11074094	11075795	Who's going to win the upcoming console war?
11076196	11079378	Nate, I think it's too damn early to tell.
11079919	11081880	You only have one console.
11083321	11089687	Well, here's the thing, because we don't know what PlayStation 4 and what the new Xbox have under their belt.
11091808	11093909	We're not really going to know that until E3.
11098851	11103033	Right now we have to also evaluate how is the Wii U going to do.
11103434	11107896	We're hearing about sellouts and pre-order stuff and that they're hard to get.
11108496	11138066	but how much of that is legitimately everybody wants them in demand and how much of that is Nintendo is slowly like a faucet drip letting these consoles out to create that artificial demand well I'm going to tell you right now who's going to win the whole console wars here and it's going to come out of left field here it's the GE micro box microwave slash console because we're talking about the future and no one knows what the future is that's what's going to win microwave console
11143170	11161705	okay another question all right okay so I'll hear you all talking about Green Throttle um if you if you have to pick between Green Throttle and Ouya who you vote for oh damn that's a pretty good question because I don't I don't really know enough about Green Throttle yet um
11162885	11168466	Based on presentation and power and fame, glory, money.
11168906	11180949	I'm going to have to go OUYA only reason because it's an actual console versus it's basically Green Throttle is just, okay, we have a controller that's paired with some games that we're making, but it doesn't have any hardware platform that it's meant for.
11181149	11184050	They don't have like their own Android device or something.
11184130	11187951	So you're going to get varied performance depending on what kind of Android device that you have.
11188411	11197557	So that's the only problem there is it's not a standardized platform, whereas the Ouya is actually going to be a device that they make games for that they know will run well on that platform.
11197837	11210285	I'm going to say the Ouya as well because, again, I'm a little concerned about Apple could really knock this green-throttled thing down a few pegs by doing their own thing, whereas the Ouya is going to be a little tougher.
11210385	11213467	I think the Ouya is kind of trying to beat Apple at its own game in a way.
11213887	11214787	I think it's a little different.
11215188	11217029	So I'm going to go Ouya as well.
11218250	11218851	Last question.
11218971	11229059	What is the best game you think is going to come out between now and summer?
11230020	11231121	Now and summer.
11231221	11238487	So of all these games that got pushed back to 2013 that make up the first and second quarter releases, what's going to be the best game to come out?
11238907	11240609	I'm going to say Mass Effect Trilogy on PS3.
11242429	11243491	No, no, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
11244832	11248637	I am really looking forward to the Tomb Raider reboot.
11249238	11250500	That's not coming out before summer.
11251421	11252222	Oh, get out.
11252302	11254065	I thought it was pushed back to only like March.
11256188	11258611	Yeah, yeah, go look that up in your Funkin' Wagnalls.
11261139	11262701	I'm looking forward to Omega.
11263382	11264644	Omega DLC.
11264724	11265225	Massive.
11265265	11266086	Are there any games?
11266166	11266507	Come on.
11267168	11267989	Oh, Omega.
11268730	11272595	I don't know if it'll make summer, Nate, but the Final Fantasy 14 Realm Reborn.
11272856	11273817	No, that's fall next year.
11273857	11275079	I'm damn curious about that.
11276583	11278724	I don't give questions but yes ask away
11306229	11311333	Alright, you've asked us about console wars and what we're looking forward to and all this stuff.
11311873	11314616	What do you want to see happen in gaming in 2013?
11317158	11323783	Okay, so I'm just going to be a little vague because there's other things I could talk about but I don't want to talk about now.
11325164	11335112	I would like to see the rise of indie gaming and also far less social games and all these small touchscreen games.
11335711	11337353	That's what I would like to see less of in 2013.
11337393	11339436	I don't have a smartphone, so that's like a no.
11355787	11358208	So screw everybody else.
11358288	11361270	I'm a console-er, PC-er.
11362150	11364531	I'll try to play Angry Birds, but that's about it.
11364671	11365132	PC.
11365412	11366252	You know what?
11366893	11371255	Indie, of course, has a huge life on PC, and lots of great indie stuff gets their start on PC.
11371935	11372995	And I'm with you.
11373035	11375096	I'd like to see some more indie games make it big.
11375437	11378918	You know, the best games to come, we probably don't even know about yet.
11379378	11379899	Think about that.
11380539	11380819	All right.
11381740	11382780	Thank you for the questions.
11382840	11383600	We appreciate it.
11383760	11384581	Have a good one, buddy, okay?
11385615	11386315	Alright, talk to you later.
11386335	11386855	Alright, you too.
11386995	11387195	Bye.
11387936	11388116	Bye.
11388836	11389476	See, I like that.
11389516	11391396	I like the whole, you're going to ask me questions?
11391556	11393057	Oh yeah, buddy, I got a question for you.
11393077	11396238	Our job sucks, huh?
11396298	11396838	No, I'm kidding.
11396858	11397538	No, I loved it.
11397858	11399498	I love getting questions.
11399518	11402259	1-877-GAME-OLR or I use your name on Skype.
11403099	11403739	Orange Lounge Radio.
11405360	11406100	Let's go to the phones.
11408360	11409241	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
11409261	11409641	Who's this?
11410161	11411081	Legend of Zaku here.
11411121	11412942	Zaku, you must have loved that interview tonight.
11414122	11414382	Hello?
11415080	11415500	Thanks for watching!
11439451	11452754	I guess this is probably going to be out of the ordinary, but I've had this thing that had my Steam collection that I've been wanting to wrangle down because I've gotten so many games yet I have a backlog.
11453114	11461357	It's created such a backlog that I'm not sure how to actually systematically approach having to tackle all these games I have.
11461377	11462957	I'm going to post it right now in the chat room.
11465631	11474923	I have some of them already, I'm putting time on them, but there's still plenty that I just bought because they were cheap at that point and I just got them for the sake of getting them.
11475644	11483654	But now it's like, I don't know, I'm preventing myself from getting games because it's going to add more fuel to the fire.
11483874	11487276	Well, you're doing the right thing by investing 99 hours in Skyrim.
11487776	11490778	52 hours, Team 76, Battlefield Bad Company.
11490858	11492719	Alright, you got your priorities right.
11492819	11495140	I'm just trying to see if there's a game you're not playing enough.
11495781	11496781	Okay, Torchlight?
11496861	11497502	What's up with this?
11497642	11499142	Less than an hour on Torchlight.
11499222	11500143	You gotta fix that, buddy.
11500203	11503245	I have put in more time, but that was on my Mac.
11503725	11504525	Alright, fair enough.
11505066	11512150	That was when I was heading down to Otakon on the train and I didn't even have a connection, so I was playing offline.
11513174	11515877	So that time didn't get counted for yet.
11517319	11521905	You would make Alan a very sad puppy with all these Half-Life games you own that you haven't even played yet.
11522445	11523166	I know, I know.
11523206	11524408	I'm guilty of that.
11525269	11531316	And I'm also in between Battlefield 3 and Hawks, which is crapping out on me, so I had to switch up to other games.
11531736	11533037	and Loki.
11533337	11533717	Look at this.
11533897	11537900	Loki, look what he's got here sitting in his collection untouched right there.
11537940	11538400	You see that?
11539080	11541482	Grand Theft Auto 4 and episodes from Liberty City.
11541502	11542662	What do you have to say about that?
11543122	11544063	Probably got them really cheap.
11544903	11545164	Yes.
11545264	11546104	You can do that.
11547845	11550447	you know what buddy it's all good at least you're supporting these developers
11573368	11574509	Alright, one more thing.
11574749	11587279	Seeing that Black Friday and the holiday shopping season is upon us, I'm kind of at a crossroads where, like, I don't know what else to invest in my 360 that isn't already out on PC and isn't already on another platform.
11587879	11599929	Like, every time I go to GameStop or any video game store, I'm always hard, I'm always pressed as to trying to find something that, A, obviously isn't PC or on a PS3, and B, isn't like a first-person shooter.
11600789	11610073	So it's kind of like finding that small scope of console exclusives that I can't really play that I would normally otherwise play on another platform.
11610973	11623458	Honestly, Zaku, if Xbox Live isn't doing it for you and the community on there and the indie games and some of the stuff that you can download on Xbox and all that, maybe you should think about offloading your Xbox.
11623578	11626840	Because, yeah, when it comes to exclusives, you know, Microsoft's...
11628540	11629281	Again, there's Kinect.
11629421	11631681	A PS3 is definitely... Yeah, I know.
11631781	11639564	I can understand that I'm kind of contemplating it, but on the other hand, I am long overdue for a PS3.
11639744	11646366	Let's just say that my girlfriend was hinting at telling me to avoid getting one in the next couple of weeks.
11646826	11653608	I can pretty much say with certainty that she's probably hinting towards getting me something like that.
11654388	11654968	What a nice girl.
11654988	11655949	So I might be able to...
11656969	11666412	to exploit that avenue in terms of playing the PS3 exclusives that I missed out on, like Gran Turismo 5, the Uncharted series, Metal Gear Solid 4.
11666612	11668092	No, Gran Turismo 5 never came out.
11669853	11670173	Did.
11670193	11672894	That's a running joke.
11672914	11674014	That's not what Bobby said.
11674054	11675115	That's not what Bobby said.
11676815	11679236	It did, but it's like, yeah, it's kind of like that.
11680458	11685603	Redheaded Stepchild, but I mean, with GT5, I could plug in a high-end racing wheel.
11686244	11697835	I wouldn't be able to do a Forza, for example, since I'm not going to play with some virtual wireless wheel that I have to pretend like doing air steering, which I have, which is garbage.
11697915	11699877	You don't have to do air steering with Forza, though.
11701759	11707604	Bobby was very kind to Forza, and he wrote the review on vognetwork.com, and I know Actdeft's a big fan of it as well.
11707724	11708585	I played the demo.
11708985	11714871	I liked it, but I just spent $120 on games this week, so I won't be picking up Forza anytime soon, but I'm interested.
11715351	11741279	Force is pretty good for what it's worth on the 360, but in terms of actually for a hardcore racing gamer who wants to plug in their Logitech G27 in there, which is not even possible because it only supports PC and PS3, I'm basically forced to buy their bullshit wireless wheel that's just like a yoke-shaped
11743280	11743680	DarkSakura.com
11766417	11766918	Sure, buddy.
11767098	11767919	It's worth a shot.
11768300	11769101	Go to Montana.
11769201	11770142	Ain't no one care out there.
11770443	11772906	All right, Saku, I got to let you go so we can wrap up the show.
11772966	11774048	Maybe get one more call, all right?
11774709	11775009	All right.
11775209	11775550	Take care.
11775570	11776211	Have a good one.
11776391	11776912	Bye, you too.
11776932	11777913	Bye.
11777933	11778213	All right.
11778233	11781438	1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
11781818	11784260	I suppose we have time for one more call.
11803251	11814359	If you do not own the Tatsunoko vs. Capcom game, you better hurry up and find it in a bargain bin somewhere because Capcom no longer holds the rights to publish Tatsunoko games.
11814419	11816261	That was a limited deal.
11817562	11819283	I have mine.
11819904	11822946	If you're hoping for a part two, keep right on hoping.
11824318	11826000	Foxconn rumored to be planting US plants
11837952	11841614	Isn't Foxconn that company in China that all those controversial stories?
11841874	11844696	Is this a goodwill thing or what is this?
11845076	11848378	But yeah, apparently they are evaluating Detroit and L.A.
11848418	11849379	for new operations.
11850839	11852400	They're outsourcing here?
11853261	11854181	Are we cheaper labor?
11855322	11858604	Hold on, I'll get back to the story in a minute, but we got one more call coming in.
11858624	11860145	I'll take this call and then we'll go back to the story.
11860905	11861826	Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio.
11861866	11862226	Who's this?
11863166	11863987	Hey, this is Actdeft.
11864247	11864827	Actdeft.
11864847	11865548	What's on your mind, buddy?
11866963	11871647	Well, I want to talk about Forza Horizon 2, something that Zaku said.
11872307	11872688	Uh-oh.
11872768	11873048	All right.
11873068	11875330	What did you want to say in response to what Zaku said?
11876591	11887059	He says Forza isn't, or Forza Horizon isn't made for, well, playing it with a real controller or racing controller.
11887880	11889922	And he's pretty wrong on that.
11890282	11890923	He's wrong.
11890983	11891723	You're calling him out.
11892124	11892724	Why is he wrong?
11894165	11904376	Well, basically, one of my friends I play Forza frequently with, he has a Fanta controller, and those controllers are, like, really expensive.
11906178	11912865	They have a lot of stuff that makes it feel like you're driving a real car, so...
11914449	11931080	Basically, you can play with a real controller, a good controller, even though it does feel different, even from Forza 4, but you can still play it.
11931961	11939186	Now, Zaku in chat is clarifying, I didn't bash Forza Horizon, Forza 4 sucked ass on the 360 wireless steering wheel.
11939366	11939726	Well, that's...
11942506	11943307	That's different.
11943627	11946149	I don't know about the 360 controller.
11946709	11949851	Forza Horizon, the demo played alright to me.
11950051	11952533	It was really stupid proof.
11952793	11954395	The demo was really stupid proof.
11954475	11958617	I played on easy and it was like, here, let me break the car for you.
11958698	11961159	It's like having a driving instructor sitting right next to you.
11961219	11964161	I'm like, oh, this is what I needed to be able to play Forza.
11964201	11964842	This is great.
11966463	11967664	I am being totally honest.
11968936	11976823	Well, I have played since Forza 2 and I loved it because it's so easy to pretty much pick up and play.
11977183	11990494	Even though it does get harder on later races or difficulty, it's pretty much easy to play because you have so much things that help the driver or the player.
11991656	12001814	that you can pretty much screw up a race even though the game will help you to correct that and be a better player.
12003044	12006365	So you give Forza Horizon your stamp of approval as well.
12006405	12008426	I know I saw Bobby gave it a good review on the site.
12008586	12009767	Did you give it a good review too?
12010887	12019390	Yeah, I pretty much gave the same points as Bobby, even though the difficulty in Forza Horizon can be pretty unforgiving.
12019990	12021431	But it's still a great game.
12022571	12025272	Even single player or multiplayer, it's really good.
12026013	12026313	Alright.
12026833	12029215	And it looks like they just want to clarify one more thing.
12029315	12030997	Not bashing the game, says BlackWolf.
12031037	12033439	He's bashing Microsoft's controller standards.
12034400	12034900	No, I know.
12035281	12038704	I know, but like I said, if you have a good controller, it will work.
12038924	12043989	Yeah, 360 does have some, that controller does leave some things to be desired, especially when it comes to that D-pad.
12044429	12047972	All right, Actdeft, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much, buddy, okay?
12048673	12048953	Thank you.
12049093	12049614	All right, take care.
12050374	12051975	Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
12052275	12054476	I'm going to close it up because we are running a little long.
12054716	12059098	I want to finish up Twitter and then I'll let Loki do any last minute stories or Jamie.
12060338	12069322	That Foxconn story, let's see, it's a Digitimes report saying that Foxconn Electronics plans to set up manufacturing plants in the US looking at Detroit and Los Angeles.
12070183	12084600	market watchers are the source of the news these facilities would be expected to handle LCD TV manufacturing it's a simpler and more automated process so it requires a lot less suicide stop it
12086002	12089545	Take that with a gigantic grain of salt, but there you go.
12091126	12094409	One other tweet I want to read here is from SpazinatorPSN on Twitter.
12095009	12099533	Sky, I'm challenging to top some of my high scores in Game Room.
12100053	12101515	Yes, I said Game Room.
12101895	12102075	What?
12102195	12102535	What's that?
12102555	12103616	We're going to party like it's 2010.
12103696	12105878	What's a Game Room?
12106879	12108100	He's talking about Microsoft Game Room.
12108600	12111701	I haven't touched Game Room in a while, and I should.
12111841	12115122	I'm going to go back, and I'll go back.
12115142	12119144	I did spend money on a lot of those games, a lot more than I really should be admitting.
12119484	12122725	So I do need to go back and show Spazinator how it's done.
12122945	12124745	So fine.
12125226	12126166	Challenge accepted.
12126186	12128707	Probably be able to set some high scores because no one plays it anymore.
12128727	12129687	Challenge accepted.
12131440	12133241	Loki, any last minute stories?
12133321	12133861	Just a couple.
12134201	12137383	There was a comment about Minecraft.
12137823	12143185	They were basically saying that the future of Minecraft is the consumer.
12143385	12153809	And the reason that is is because one of the things that they're working on is the whole new mod interface that they're going to allow people to be able to mod Minecraft a lot easier.
12154090	12155710	Because right now it's a little bit difficult.
12155750	12158932	You kind of have to replace files in the jar file and stuff like that.
12158972	12159612	And it's just not...
12160092	12160653	Thank you for watching!
12184167	12193371	Ubisoft wants to get their full retail games onto the Wii U eShop as soon as possible.
12194752	12200315	I can understand why, because they had a good portion of the games for the Vita launch, and I bet a lot of those sold digitally.
12201204	12204665	Yeah, when there's nothing else to buy, your games look pretty appealing.
12204685	12206106	They have a lot of games.
12206206	12207526	Push button, get game.
12207766	12209387	You never even have to hand anybody money.
12209627	12222492	Of course, the problem with downloading the games is, remember, you need to have storage space, which really, you're only going to be able to get about one or two games on the premium model there.
12222672	12224133	You're going to need an external hard drive.
12226073	12226794	It's an extra step.
12226834	12236398	I understand it's not necessarily an expensive step but it's still an extra step to have a hard drive to put those games on.
12239119	12239459	That's it.
12240037	12242038	Alright, well that does it.
12242218	12244478	This is almost a three and a half hour show tonight.
12244978	12256862	Well, it helps that we actually get to play the break tonight, so it helps give more content on the podcast and something for the worker bees who listen to our show on Mondays and Tuesdays and throughout the week, something to listen to.
12257602	12259863	I really want to thank you all for tuning in tonight.
12259904	12266687	I want to thank Eddie for coming on the show and staying for 45 minutes close to much more than the 15 to 20 I told him it would be.
12267288	12268868	So big thanks to him for coming out tonight.
12269209	12275552	I want to thank Jen from Girl Gamer Vogue for doing that interview with DJ Ranma S as well.
12275572	12277933	That was great to meet her through Ranma.
12278494	12281755	And I want to thank my co-hosts for being here tonight too.
12283016	12284157	You're welcome.
12284637	12286398	I want to thank myself for being here.
12286678	12287518	Thank you, Rob.
12287619	12290560	Thank you, Rob, because if it weren't for you, I wouldn't be here tonight.
12291661	12293021	I wasn't even supposed to be here today.
12294462	12296303	And I want to thank the listeners for showing up.
12296483	12301205	Through apparently seven drops of the feed, they stayed with the show tonight.
12301466	12302066	I know, right?
12302166	12306868	We've got to figure out what the hell's... Like, Alan's not here, so there's no bandwidth coming out of the office tonight.
12306888	12309129	No, I don't think it's us, because... I don't think it is either.
12309309	12312491	I mean, I'm not getting disconnected from chat, so... Yeah, something's up.
12312531	12313912	I'm not running anything either, so...
12314372	12317134	But anyway, thank you guys again for your support.
12317215	12320497	And if you got to the whole end of the show, you're listening on the podcast, you know what?
12320537	12322819	Thank you, too, for listening to all three and a half hours of it.
12322839	12323680	You guys rock.
12324201	12329225	Of course, I could be really evil and vindictive and put the passphrase right here at the very, very end so people have to listen.
12329766	12330206	Boogers!
12330386	12330987	No, it's not.
12331127	12331507	Don't listen.
12331587	12332027	It's not it.
12334069	12336631	Anyhow, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
12336892	12338213	DarkSakura, what's your final thought tonight?
12338504	12339364	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
12361896	12368360	and meaning that all of the stock increases go directly into their retirement funds.
12368700	12369060	Nice.
12369320	12370801	As a trust they can also borrow from.
12371241	12376144	Which I wish more companies would be like that, you know, to work for the benefit of their employees.
12376204	12376784	And they make food.
12376804	12379305	Just saying, not all rich people are assholes, I guess.
12381314	12382436	Loki, your final thought tonight.
12382776	12383738	My car sucks.
12384098	12385440	Hopefully I get a new car, though.
12385901	12387343	Because we're looking at new cars now.
12387823	12389746	Or new to me cars.
12390627	12391609	Not necessarily new cars.
12392690	12393191	Less old?
12394593	12395414	Not necessarily.
12396316	12397237	Less mileage, hopefully.
12398178	12416378	I want to thank everybody for listening to the show tonight and sticking with it and remember if you like our show just tell a friend or two about the show help spread the word that's all we ask we don't charge for it or anything like that so just help spread the word about the VOG Network and what we're doing here and that's all we want just help grow our community

12430630	12432172	You'll never know that you voted twice.
12432532	12433193	All right, stop.
12433293	12435054	All right, that does it.
12435134	12435715	My final thought.
12435815	12437977	I'm going to go with an old classic.
12438557	12439438	My final thought tonight.
12440019	12442501	Be good to yourself and each other.
12443874	12445357	Be excellent to each other.
12446178	12447381	Have a wonderful week everybody.
