7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	20000	Tonight, November 11th, 2012, Nintendo reveals some more details about the Wii U
20000	27000	THQ delays games as stocks fall, and could the Kinect soon police your content licenses?
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	37000	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice
37000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 481 for this November the 11th of 2012
45000	51000	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and all that good stuff
52000	55000	With my co-hosts, first off, the one, the only, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers
55000	56000	Hi
56000	57000	How are you, Jamie Summers?
57000	59000	Um, I'm okay
59000	61000	Your knitting rainbow things over here are crocheting
61000	66000	I'm crocheting the gayest scarf ever, all it needs is KY jelly and it'll be gayer
66000	72000	Are you planning in advance of Gay Pride Month? Are you planning to sell these?
72000	79000	No, this is actually, it's a scheme that I've had for a while and I thought was kind of a different bit of yarn
80000	84000	But, um, I've been taking orders for scrap scarves
84000	87000	Basically I'm working through all of my old cheap yarn
87000	91000	And this was actually a fairly cheap scheme, I just didn't realize that it was going to crochet up so pretty
91000	100000	So I'm actually going to go back and buy more of them to make people scarves and things for various pride events and whatnots
100000	104000	Or like the holidays? Because, you know, everybody likes a homemade holiday gift, I do
104000	110000	Well, that's actually why I texted you a while back and asked if you or Alan were allergic to wool
110000	112000	Yay! Awesome
112000	113000	Because I'm broke
113000	118000	Well, also say hello to somebody that I'm sure is making lots of homemade gifts for the holiday, Techmaster Loki
118000	120000	Um, no, I'm not
120000	124000	You're not going to bake cookies for everybody for the holidays?
124000	126000	No, I don't do much baking
126000	127000	Well, how have you-
127000	129000	Let's order some cookies from Colorado
129000	132000	Right? How have you been doing, Loki?
132000	135000	Oh, fantastic with my car not working and everything
135000	137000	Oh, yeah, sorry to hear about that
137000	139000	Yeah, it was the Ford we expect
139000	140000	Fix or repair daily, right?
140000	141000	Yeah
141000	146000	Well, it's not just the three of us on the show every week, it's you guys joining us live in our chat room
146000	150000	If you want to join us in the chat room, head on over to live.vognetwork.com

163000	166000	And again, our chat room live.vognetwork.com
166000	169000	You know, there is another thing that Ford can stand for
169000	170000	What?
170000	171000	Found on Road Dead
171000	172000	Yeah, I've heard that one too
172000	174000	From a parking lot
174000	175000	But it doesn't work
175000	177000	Yeah
177000	182000	Alright, so we're going to get into some news and what we've been playing this week
182000	185000	And some big interviews tonight that I will talk about in just a moment
185000	188000	But I do want to start off the show first because we have some interviews tonight
188000	190000	I know we might have a few new listeners because of that
190000	192000	I want to say hello, welcome to the show
192000	194000	Reintroduce ourselves a little bit
194000	198000	We try to do that once every few months or so for those folks that are new to Orange Lounge Radio
198000	200000	But if you are new to Orange Lounge Radio, hello
200000	206000	We're a show, we created this show, myself, Dark Soccer and Loki all created this show
206000	208000	Ten years ago, over ten years ago
208000	212000	We all met playing a little game you might have heard of in the arcades
212000	215000	Stomping arrows called Dance Dance Revolution
215000	219000	And we used to play that pretty aggressively here in the south
219000	221000	I don't know what other words you used to describe it
221000	223000	We were angry DDR players
223000	225000	Damn these arrows, damn them
225000	227000	And birthday parties
227000	231000	At Roseville Golf Land where we sat on the floor in front of the fourth mix and ate cake
231000	233000	That was my birthday
233000	237000	I still remember one of the first dream games we ever had on Orange Lounge Radio
237000	239000	Was inspired by Golf Land trips
239000	241000	You called it birthday party sniper
241000	243000	Something like that
243000	246000	Yeah, Roseville Golf Land is an interesting place
246000	249000	It still is today, interesting is a good word to describe it
249000	251000	Like people who pick their nose and eat it
251000	252000	It's interesting
252000	256000	I went not too long ago and wore myself out by DDR
256000	258000	I was like, I got old
258000	259000	I know right
259000	262000	But anyway, ten years ago we all met playing DDR
262000	264000	And we were really into that scene
264000	266000	It wasn't just DDR
266000	268000	It was a lot of the imports coming from Japan
268000	271000	We used to have the Bamani parties here locally
271000	273000	The sacramentals having the Bamani parties
273000	277000	Where we'd bust out the Beatmania 5 key, the Beatmania 2DX
277000	278000	Guitar freaks
278000	280000	I remember I couldn't get that name because a Catholic organization took it
280000	281000	Really?
281000	282000	Yeah
282000	283000	I forgot about that
283000	284000	Well anyway
284000	287000	So we decided to make this little show
287000	291000	Because I have some prior radio experience dating back to college
291000	294000	And another show I was on many years ago called Undersedation Live
294000	298000	And myself, Dark Soccer, and Loki after a long day at the arcade
298000	300000	No matter what we were playing at the time
300000	303000	Whether it be DDR, Initial D, or something like that
303000	306000	We used to go to a little restaurant that was in the parking lot
306000	309000	And we'd just kind of sit around, order things that were bad for us
309000	310000	Like mozzarella sticks
310000	312000	And just talk some shit about video games
312000	314000	And what was going on
314000	318000	And so that was really the type of thing we wanted to bring here to the internets
318000	320000	Is this giant virtual table
320000	322000	Where we're all sitting on one side of it here in the studio
322000	323000	Talking our stuff
323000	325000	And then you guys kind of make up the rest of that table
325000	327000	Sitting here with us in the chat room
327000	329000	And via the Skype line and so forth
329000	331000	Just talking some good stuff about video games
331000	332000	And just having fun with it
332000	334000	Because that's what video games are all about
334000	335000	Fun and
335000	337000	Talking smack about stupid people
337000	339000	DDR and that whole thing and Beatmania
339000	340000	Bimani in general
340000	342000	Music games was really all about community
342000	344000	So segueing a little bit into
344000	346000	One of the interviews we're going to have tonight
346000	348000	Is with our buddy Eddie
348000	350000	He runs a website you might have heard of
350000	351000	If you've played music games before
351000	353000	It's called BimaniStyle.com
353000	355000	And that site's been around a very long time
355000	357000	In fact I think it's older than us
357000	358000	By a few months
358000	361000	So we're going to talk to Eddie tonight
361000	362000	About community
362000	363000	Because he has
363000	366000	Especially now that DDR Freak is sunsetted
366000	367000	It's no more
367000	372000	He probably has the largest music game community that's out there
372000	374000	So I want to talk to him just kind of about
374000	375000	The past
375000	376000	The future
376000	377000	And so forth
377000	380000	And have some fun commentary with him on that
380000	383000	So we'll be talking to him in about 15 minutes or so
383000	385000	Also on tonight's show
385000	386000	We have another interview
386000	388000	A taped interview we're going to play tonight during our break
388000	390000	Where the music usually is
390000	392000	This is something that DJ Rama S did for us
392000	393000	And I'll talk more about this
393000	394000	This whole
394000	396000	That we have other people doing interviews
396000	398000	I'll talk more about that later
398000	400000	But this is an exciting interview
400000	401000	It's Jen
401000	404000	From a website called Girl Gamer Vogue
404000	406000	GG Vogue.com
406000	407000	She's going to talk about
407000	409000	Her girl gaming community
409000	410000	In the tri-state area back east
410000	411000	And why she made it
411000	412000	And what it's all about
412000	414000	So we're going to have that a little later on in the show
414000	416000	Probably closer to about 8 o'clock
416000	418000	Before we get to the interviews and so forth
418000	420000	We're going to get into our gaming weeks
420000	421000	But I want to talk
421000	422000	A little bit here
422000	424000	At the top of the show about something personal
424000	426000	Because we did talk about
426000	428000	The shows are all about community
428000	432000	And over these 10 years that we've been doing this show
432000	435000	We have a lot of the same people that show up in our chat room week after week
436000	439000	And they like to hear the little insights that are going on in our personal lives
439000	441000	Both the good and the bad
441000	443000	And I have to share something with you guys tonight
443000	445000	That kind of happened
445000	446000	I just want to get off my chest
446000	448000	Because the weird thing about this is
448000	450000	And I'm going to apologize to Jamie in advance for this
450000	452000	Because a lot of this is very deja vu
452000	454000	To a story that she told
454000	456000	Not even three weeks ago
456000	457000	Perfectly okay
457000	458000	Just forgive me if I get sniffy
458000	459000	It's fine
459000	461000	The whole thing's just weird
461000	463000	So you guys can probably guess where I'm going with this
463000	465000	If I'm referencing that
465000	467000	As many of you know
467000	469000	I moved in with my boyfriend Allen
469000	471000	About, gosh it was probably about
471000	473000	Almost two years ago now
473000	475000	And we
475000	476000	Actually more like a year and a half
476000	477000	But anyway
477000	479000	He brought with him two cats that he's had for a long time
479000	482000	Since 2000 I think
482000	485000	I think he got them around October of 2000
485000	487000	And they were about four or six months old at the time
487000	488000	Probably fudging some of these details
488000	489000	But I wasn't around back then
489000	491000	And their names are
491000	493000	Maruko and Sanrio
493000	495000	And Maruko was a male black cat
495000	497000	And Sanrio's a tan cat
497000	499000	Female
499000	501000	And you know I've grown very close to these cats as well
501000	503000	And you've probably heard them referenced on the show sometimes
503000	505000	In fact it was really weird
505000	506000	Just the other day
506000	507000	I was listening to a playback
507000	509000	Yes I do listen to OLR once in a while
509000	511000	It's a really good way to kind of be a
511000	513000	Critic of yourself
513000	515000	I was listening to the show a couple weeks ago
515000	517000	And I believe Maruko came out
517000	519000	Because I heard Jamie like
519000	521000	Oh hey Maruko like you were petting him
521000	523000	They were very unlike Shirmi
523000	525000	Where they don't come out during the shows
525000	527000	Because they're very shy
527000	529000	And they don't like people
529000	531000	She was like already there you can't move her
531000	533000	This is my couch
533000	535000	You don't like it get out
535000	539000	Maruko always pranced around with his tail in the air
539000	541000	So I always called him Mr. Priss
541000	543000	But he was also very vocal
543000	545000	And was a really fun cat
545000	547000	And I really have grown to appreciate Maruko
547000	549000	And he loves Sanrio's food
549000	551000	No doubt
551000	553000	You can sadly guess where this is going
553000	555000	We got blindsided a little bit
555000	557000	The past couple days
557000	559000	Maruko started showing some really bad symptoms
559000	561000	On Thursday and Friday
561000	563000	He just wasn't himself
563000	565000	I can't even describe it
565000	567000	His meows were different
567000	569000	He was always a very vocal cat
569000	571000	The way he was breathing was very different as well
571000	573000	So I told Alan well of course let's go see the vet
573000	575000	Right away
575000	577000	We got to the vet's office pretty much thinking
577000	579000	Oh you know we just need to get some medication
579000	581000	He'll be alright whatever
581000	583000	But we get the x-rays back and the news is really bad
583000	585000	He had a lot of fluid in his body
585000	587000	In places it shouldn't be
587000	589000	Basically so much around his lung
589000	591000	That it was basically pushing on his lung
591000	593000	And he was having a hard time breathing
593000	595000	That was causing it
595000	597000	Unfortunately
597000	599000	A tough decision had to be made
599000	601000	And we put him down yesterday
601000	603000	And it was
603000	605000	What can I say?
605000	607000	It was devastating
607000	609000	Just the shock of it all
609000	611000	Just the fact that this came out
611000	613000	Of literally nowhere
613000	615000	Even though this thing that he'd been developing
615000	617000	Apparently was silently developing for years
617000	619000	But even if we had
619000	621000	The thousands of dollars to pursue
621000	623000	A diagnosis and figure out
623000	625000	What was causing it
625000	627000	The veterinarian made it pretty clear that
627000	629000	It's probably heart failure
629000	631000	It's probably cancer
631000	633000	I have another friend that just lost a cat to FIP
633000	635000	Not that long ago
635000	637000	So it's just like
637000	639000	It's tough
639000	641000	With Shermy she was wheezing
641000	643000	When we got back from Disneyland
643000	645000	And then I wrapped her up in hot towels
645000	647000	For a few days
647000	649000	And she perked right back up
649000	651000	And then suddenly she just
651000	653000	Keeled over
653000	655000	But the symptoms sound very serious
655000	657000	And it's just like
657000	659000	It's just like
659000	661000	But the symptoms sound very serious
661000	663000	She was having respiratory issues
663000	665000	Since some folks in the chat room
665000	667000	Are asking at live.vognetwork.com
667000	669000	The Maruko was 12 and a half
669000	671000	So a little old
671000	673000	In kitty ears
673000	675000	For an indoor cat
675000	677000	Maybe not super old
677000	679000	But definitely old enough
679000	681000	For complications to start coming in
681000	683000	So I don't know what else to say
683000	685000	I just want to get that off my chest
685000	687000	So that way if I'm gonna sniffle up
687000	689000	And not while we're trying to interview somebody
689000	691000	Hi Eddie how are you?
691000	693000	He was a very good kitty
693000	695000	And he sat in my lap a couple times
695000	697000	Well you used to cat sit
697000	699000	So I know you were one of the first people I called in the parking lot
699000	701000	And I was like
701000	703000	I'm driving
703000	705000	I was actually literally
705000	707000	This was at what Florin Mall used to be
707000	709000	If you want to know where I was
709000	711000	And I was having the thing to pull out
711000	713000	Into the street when you called
713000	715000	And I was trying to be considerate
715000	717000	And I was like okay fine
717000	719000	And then it went on to FaceTime
719000	721000	I was like oh shit have I been on FaceTime this entire time
721000	723000	And turn around and pull in
723000	725000	And I had my friend with me
725000	727000	And then I just did a circle in the parking lot
727000	729000	Anyway I want to try and move on
729000	731000	I don't want to dwell on this too much
731000	733000	But I do want to address
733000	735000	Some of the comments that are in chatroom
735000	737000	At live.vognetwork.com
737000	739000	Lots of condolences and thank you very much
739000	741000	I will pass those along to Alan as well
741000	743000	I was only fortunate enough to know Maruko for about 3 years
743000	745000	But he did live for 12 and a half
745000	747000	Tigerclaw says my condolences
747000	749000	Losing a pet is the hardest thing a person could ever go through
749000	751000	It is definitely one of the worst
751000	753000	Tigerclaw asks how about Sanrio
753000	755000	How is she health wise
755000	757000	Obviously the plan is
757000	759000	When we have money
759000	761000	Because yesterday set us back a little bit
761000	763000	But when we have some money we do want to go in and get her checked
763000	765000	And make sure she didn't contract the same virus
765000	767000	That's one of the first things we want to try and rule out
767000	769000	She's doing okay
769000	771000	She's hard to read right now
771000	773000	I think she knows something's up
773000	775000	She's kind of looking around
775000	777000	Acting a little differently
777000	779000	I think she knows something's missing
779000	781000	But that's to be expected
781000	783000	But she still has some of her playfulness
783000	785000	I took a really cute video earlier today
785000	787000	Of her playing with a string
787000	789000	So you know
789000	791000	We'll see
791000	793000	We'll try to get her in as soon as we can
793000	795000	When we can financially
795000	797000	Take care of it
797000	799000	Going to some other comments in our chatroom
799000	801000	I like this from Breakman it's very good
801000	803000	Cats and dogs are such a great part of our life
803000	805000	But they are so fragile
805000	807000	And their time with us is far too short
807000	809000	Ain't that the truth
809000	811000	Gamegrew says I'm sorry about your cat
811000	813000	I've lost my last cat a few months ago
813000	815000	It's tough
815000	817000	And especially
817000	819000	The suddenness of it all
819000	821000	Is tough
821000	823000	I want to move on
823000	825000	How do we escape from reality
825000	827000	By playing video games
827000	829000	Well not in my case I drank and cried
829000	831000	For a night
831000	833000	We haven't quite had that phase
833000	835000	Yet and I'm hoping we'll be alright
835000	837000	But if we have to have that we will
837000	839000	Sometimes it doesn't hit you
839000	841000	For a little while
841000	843000	Let's talk about video games and some of the other
843000	845000	Distractions and things that are better
845000	847000	And again if you do want to join us in our chatroom
847000	849000	Live.vognetwork.com is the place
849000	851000	To be
851000	853000	DarkSagra why don't you start us off tonight
853000	855000	I have a very happy announcement of something
855000	857000	That I've played
857000	859000	Mass Effect 3
859000	861000	What a shock
861000	863000	The ghost patch
863000	865000	Is what we're calling it
865000	867000	Because I just decided on a whim
867000	869000	To check on it after a fresh boot
869000	871000	And it patched something
871000	873000	And I'm like really?
873000	875000	And so I loaded it and of course it rewrote
875000	877000	My hack file which is fine
877000	879000	And I
879000	881000	I loaded it up
881000	883000	And lo and behold I had zero
883000	885000	Problems none of the lag none of any of that
885000	887000	So I was
887000	889000	Quite happily surprised
889000	891000	And I
891000	893000	Even checked it
893000	895000	You know with other people
895000	897000	I you know did a bunch of
897000	899000	Other stuff to make sure it wasn't just a
899000	901000	A
901000	903000	You know
903000	905000	What's the word I'm thinking of?
905000	907000	Not a whim
907000	909000	But just a one off
909000	911000	Thing and
911000	913000	It kept working and so I was like
913000	915000	Everyone get a multiplayer right now
915000	917000	So I played for a while with
917000	919000	Shane and Tim
919000	921000	And then I played again
921000	923000	With Shane and
923000	925000	Tim and Spike the other day
925000	927000	And with my friend George
927000	929000	And everything was fine I still kind of suck at it
929000	931000	But I'm getting better and
931000	933000	Got a few levels in did the N7
933000	935000	Challenge thing
935000	937000	Fun so you got a banner
937000	939000	And I wore my N7 shirt
939000	941000	That day and
941000	943000	I also went in just to
943000	945000	See if it was like a completely new patch
945000	947000	So I tried to um to hack my game
947000	949000	Again and well more like
949000	951000	Hex edit it so that I could get the console to
951000	953000	Unlock and the same it's at
953000	955000	The same sector it still works so
955000	957000	But everyone if you're trying to do
957000	959000	The hex edit based on what's on
959000	961000	The mass effect wiki it's
961000	963000	Not F4 for the last two
963000	965000	Numbers it's F3 just letting
965000	967000	You know I
967000	969000	Did that on screw that up no I did it
969000	971000	Because there's no F4 I did
971000	973000	I did the F3 on a win because I found the
973000	975000	Same sector and it worked so
975000	977000	They have it on there wrong
977000	979000	So um as
979000	981000	I just said Tigerclaw um probably
981000	983000	Didn't hear but I can play online again
983000	985000	And I went back in on my DLC
985000	987000	Works and so that means I'm good
987000	989000	To go for Omega but we're calling
989000	991000	It the ghost patch because
991000	993000	They didn't announce anything
993000	995000	They didn't even acknowledge that there
995000	997000	Was a problem the only acknowledgement
997000	999000	That I got was from
999000	1001000	Some guy
1001000	1003000	In customer service
1003000	1005000	Who actually worked with me for a long time
1005000	1007000	And he said yeah we're noticing that there's
1007000	1009000	A problem here we just can't say anything else about it
1009000	1011000	Right now oh really
1011000	1013000	I can't say
1013000	1015000	No comment I can't
1015000	1017000	Say anything on that he was
1017000	1019000	He did more for me than the other people
1019000	1021000	Did but
1021000	1023000	It did give me a nice little
1023000	1025000	30%
1025000	1027000	Off code which I'm going to use for the Omega
1027000	1029000	DLC
1029000	1031000	So I'm very happy
1031000	1033000	And um I played
1033000	1035000	Through Mass Effect 2 I actually did
1035000	1037000	Touch WoW long enough to
1037000	1039000	Log out while I was trying to make
1039000	1041000	Plans with you to go see Silent Hill
1041000	1043000	I completely forgot that I was logged in and
1043000	1045000	Talking to you
1045000	1047000	Did you guys go see Silent Hill? No we still haven't made it out
1047000	1049000	To see it
1049000	1051000	You need to do that
1051000	1053000	BlackWolf has a smart ass comment
1053000	1055000	In our chat room at live.vognetwork.com
1055000	1057000	In response to your fact
1057000	1059000	That the information on the wiki is wrong
1059000	1061000	He says if only it was a wiki
1061000	1063000	And everyone could edit it
1063000	1065000	That means I have to log in for an account on it and I don't
1065000	1067000	Fucking feel like it
1067000	1069000	That means I have to do work
1069000	1071000	Well the other thing
1071000	1073000	And I think I mentioned it last week is now that I have a job
1073000	1075000	Like a real job
1075000	1077000	That's going to pay me some good money
1077000	1079000	Hooray for money
1079000	1081000	That I kind of haven't had much
1081000	1083000	Garris
1083000	1085000	I haven't had a whole bunch of time
1085000	1087000	To really do much except
1087000	1089000	That the good thing about my job is that since I don't usually have to
1089000	1091000	Be in until 9 in the morning
1091000	1093000	I can stay up till midnight and sleep in
1093000	1095000	And so I can actually
1095000	1097000	Because who really feels like
1097000	1099000	Waking up early in the morning and gaming
1099000	1101000	Before work? Seriously?
1101000	1103000	Gaming is something you stay up all night
1103000	1105000	And do. You play games in the morning, Logie?
1105000	1107000	I would if I didn't have to get
1107000	1109000	The baby up
1109000	1111000	I like to stay up all night
1111000	1113000	I don't have children, that's awesome
1113000	1115000	I've stayed up all night and done that still
1115000	1117000	He's not really a baby anymore either
1117000	1119000	He's more of a toddler
1119000	1121000	Just saying
1121000	1123000	At any rate
1123000	1125000	At any rate
1125000	1127000	My schedule has actually been pretty perfect
1127000	1129000	For gaming except that
1129000	1131000	My work environment is so fast paced
1131000	1133000	And I don't get paid days off which makes me a little sad
1133000	1135000	But it's all good
1135000	1137000	That's my work
1137000	1139000	It's in a small office in a house
1139000	1141000	And I have so much freedom
1141000	1143000	For my scheduling and for things that need to happen
1143000	1145000	And I can wear socks
1145000	1147000	I ask permission to wear my fuzzy socks in the office
1147000	1149000	And I can do it
1149000	1151000	It's great. Anyways
1151000	1153000	My work allows me more game time
1153000	1155000	So I will be playing more stuff
1155000	1157000	Awesome. Logie, how was your gaming week?
1157000	1159000	I played Call of Duty Black Ops 2
1159000	1161000	Yes, I know it's not out yet
1161000	1163000	How's that gonna stop me?
1163000	1165000	When you work in games distribution
1165000	1167000	You can sometimes
1167000	1169000	You know, do things early
1169000	1171000	Anyways, so, got the play
1171000	1173000	Obviously haven't been playing any multiplayer
1173000	1175000	On it, well, no
1175000	1177000	Internet multiplayer because the servers aren't up
1177000	1179000	And also you want to be careful
1179000	1181000	Because everyone, after the whole Halo leaking out a month
1181000	1183000	Early and stuff like that
1183000	1185000	So
1185000	1187000	Been playing mainly the single player campaign
1187000	1189000	And really that's kind of cool
1189000	1191000	Because I haven't played a lot
1191000	1193000	Of the single player campaigns
1193000	1195000	I played a bit of Modern Warfare 3 single player campaign
1195000	1197000	And totally hated it
1197000	1199000	Because they were
1199000	1201000	Really penalizing you with shooting your teammates
1201000	1203000	Not that I'm trying to shoot my teammates
1203000	1205000	But everyone kind of blends in
1205000	1207000	When it's so chaotic and stuff
1207000	1209000	And it seems like Black Ops 2 isn't so
1209000	1211000	At least
1211000	1213000	I'm playing on a super easy difficulty too
1213000	1215000	Because I just really care about the story
1215000	1217000	I don't give a shit about the challenge
1217000	1219000	But
1219000	1221000	You know, I haven't had that problem
1221000	1223000	Where, oh, you accidentally killed a teammate
1223000	1225000	Because, you know, he ran in front of you
1225000	1227000	When you're firing a missile or something like that
1227000	1229000	You know, so that's kind of cool
1229000	1231000	But the story is fucking awesome
1231000	1233000	It's just like, it's really action packed
1233000	1235000	And just, I really enjoy it
1235000	1237000	And that's saying a lot
1237000	1239000	Considering that a lot of times
1239000	1241000	People consider the, like, single player
1241000	1243000	Campaign for these kind of games
1243000	1245000	To be kind of just a throw away
1245000	1247000	It's just, oh, well they have it on there
1248000	1250000	Actually, the single player is pretty awesome
1250000	1252000	Like, and I actually want to check out
1252000	1254000	The first Black Ops game
1254000	1256000	Because I never played it
1256000	1258000	But, you know, obviously carrying on with the characters
1258000	1260000	That they have from the first game
1260000	1262000	But it just, like, for example
1262000	1264000	There's one scene, it kind of flips back and forth
1264000	1266000	Between the past and the future
1266000	1268000	Warfare
1268000	1270000	So, the first kind of future warfare
1270000	1272000	One that you're in, you're kind of swinging along
1272000	1274000	This, it's like a mountainside
1274000	1276000	Or something like that
1276000	1278000	And you're tethered to this other guy
1278000	1280000	And you have these nanogloves that you can grip onto the rocks and stuff
1280000	1282000	And they're scouting out this
1282000	1284000	This base that's, you know, kind of in a temple
1284000	1286000	Or something like that
1286000	1288000	And so, they put on their wingsuits
1288000	1290000	And they fly down there
1290000	1292000	And just that sequence is so fucking awesome
1292000	1294000	It's just, like, I saw them
1294000	1296000	It's like, this is so awesome
1296000	1298000	Does it have, like, 80's metal playing in the background?
1298000	1300000	No, there's no 80's metal playing
1300000	1302000	It's very, like, cinematic
1302000	1304000	Because, uh, Knight, was it Trent Reznor
1305000	1307000	Oh, that's right!
1307000	1309000	It's just really awesome
1309000	1311000	Like, you're flying down there
1311000	1313000	And I know it's not really, like, a quick time thing and stuff
1313000	1315000	I mean, there are some quick time stuff in there
1315000	1317000	But it wasn't that big a deal
1317000	1319000	But, um, it was just really cool
1319000	1321000	And then you get into this, like, secret thing under the base
1321000	1323000	And it's like, oh, it's this, you know, nanobot factory thing
1323000	1325000	That's pretty awesome
1325000	1327000	And then there's also the one that you've seen in the trailer
1327000	1329000	Where you're riding on a horseback
1329000	1331000	And it's one of the flashback missions that you're on
1331000	1333000	But you're playing on a horseback
1333000	1335000	Like, almost the whole mission
1335000	1337000	And it's awesome, because you're just
1337000	1339000	Blowing up tanks with a rocket launcher on the back of a horse
1339000	1341000	And there's, like, helicopters flying over
1341000	1343000	Wait, say that again?
1343000	1345000	Blowing up tanks
1345000	1347000	You're blowing up tanks on the back of a horse
1347000	1349000	You're holding a rocket launcher and riding a horse
1349000	1351000	I swear to God, that was a scene in Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter
1351000	1353000	That was sort of a scene in the commercial
1353000	1355000	Except the girl had grenades
1355000	1357000	But it's just
1357000	1359000	It's so, like, chaotic and awesome
1359000	1361000	It's a really
1361000	1363000	I love it, I love the campaign
1363000	1365000	And it really kind of makes me want to go back and try some of the other
1365000	1367000	Single player campaigns of the different games
1367000	1369000	But just for some reason, this, like, kind of
1369000	1371000	Near future combat stuff is just really
1371000	1373000	Cool, like, the storyline's actually
1373000	1375000	I think really well done
1375000	1377000	So, um, definitely worth checking out
1377000	1379000	I mean, even if you're kind of thinking twice about
1379000	1381000	Eh, it's just another Modern Warfare shooter game
1381000	1383000	Check out the storyline
1383000	1385000	They actually did a pretty good job on it
1385000	1387000	So besides that, played a little bit more Minecraft
1387000	1389000	Been just trying to get, you know, plugins and stuff
1389000	1391000	To work correctly with each other
1391000	1393000	I'm working on finishing up the mob arena stuff
1393000	1395000	So I have this Magic Spells
1395000	1397000	Um, plugin that I added in there
1397000	1399000	But I didn't realize it had a dependent
1399000	1401000	Plugin with this vault thing that I had to install
1401000	1403000	In there, so I'm still trying to get that all worked out
1403000	1405000	And get the permissions set correctly
1405000	1407000	Still kind of new to the whole bucket plugin stuff
1407000	1409000	Um, and then I noticed that
1409000	1411000	One of our other users
1411000	1413000	Hitstun had turned in the Mr. Freeze
1413000	1415000	And had frozen the jungles
1415000	1417000	Everybody chill
1417000	1419000	Seriously
1419000	1421000	Wait a second, why can't I see off the roof of this
1421000	1423000	Mob arena I created
1423000	1425000	What's going on here, is it just not drawing in
1425000	1427000	I realize it's snow
1427000	1429000	Leave it to Hitstun or somebody to bring
1429000	1431000	The League of Super-Villains into the
1431000	1433000	It was an accident
1433000	1435000	He was working with World Edit
1435000	1437000	It's always an accident
1437000	1439000	That's how villains get created
1439000	1441000	Hey, it was easy to fix
1441000	1443000	Joker fell into that vat
1443000	1445000	This is what happens when you play God
1445000	1447000	And it was fixed
1447000	1449000	He was making a snow globe
1449000	1451000	In the nether
1451000	1453000	I don't know how that
1453000	1455000	Got out onto everything else
1455000	1457000	But there's snow in a bunch of the
1457000	1459000	Different chunks there
1459000	1461000	So I had to fix that
1461000	1463000	I thought it was hilarious, there was snow in the jungle
1463000	1465000	Yes, there was snow all over the jungle
1465000	1467000	I was like, this is not right
1467000	1469000	I had to find the corners and then
1469000	1471000	Welcome to the jungle, we got lots of snow
1471000	1473000	So I fixed all that
1473000	1475000	I tried playing a little bit of Curiosity
1475000	1477000	But it wasn't working
1477000	1479000	So that was that
1479000	1481000	And Call of Duty Black Ops
1481000	1483000	Or not Black Ops, Modern Warfare 3
1483000	1485000	We've been playing multiplayer of that
1485000	1487000	And that's pretty fun
1487000	1489000	I actually played a little bit of multiplayer in Black Ops 2 as well
1489000	1491000	The split screen stuff
1491000	1493000	Actually the split screen stuff
1493000	1495000	Because I was bored, I decided to take on
1495000	1497000	Nine AI characters that were the
1497000	1499000	Veteran difficulty, which is the hardest
1499000	1501000	Because it's AI
1501000	1503000	And you figure out the weaknesses in their
1503000	1505000	Pathfinding and away you go
1505000	1507000	So that was that
1507000	1509000	I forgot one other game I played
1509000	1511000	Very Solitaire
1511000	1513000	That's right because it was free, I played that too
1513000	1515000	It was actually fun
1515000	1517000	For a free game, better than Yaris
1517000	1519000	It was a good time killer
1519000	1521000	I actually had fun with it because I like card games
1521000	1523000	Yeah
1523000	1525000	It reminded me of Neopets
1525000	1527000	I wouldn't have minded paying a little bit of money for it
1527000	1529000	But it was cute
1529000	1531000	I used to play Pyramid Solitaire on Neopets all the time
1531000	1533000	That was a good tip Act F by the way last week
1533000	1535000	Oh and the last thing, one of the things that they've been hyping up
1535000	1537000	About Black Ops 2 is these whole
1537000	1539000	This kind of like strike force missions
1539000	1541000	They fucking suck
1541000	1543000	I hate the strike force missions
1543000	1545000	And the reason why is because they're on the multiplayer maps
1545000	1547000	It's basically kind of like this strategy thing
1547000	1549000	Where you get a bunch of different troops and stuff
1549000	1551000	And you can kind of, okay go here defend this
1551000	1553000	Go here attack this
1553000	1555000	And you can jump into each of them
1555000	1557000	It's supposed to add this kind of strategy element to it
1557000	1559000	The problem is though
1559000	1561000	Is the controlling of that stuff is really terrible
1561000	1563000	And so you're telling your troops to go here
1563000	1565000	And then you're trying to select one soldier
1565000	1567000	And it's selecting all of them
1567000	1569000	It's pain in the ass
1569000	1571000	I found it more efficient for me to go into a soldier
1571000	1573000	And just do the mission myself
1573000	1575000	So that's kind of the only
1575000	1577000	Poopoo thing about Black Ops 2 right now
1577000	1579000	Halo Man in our chat room
1579000	1581000	At live.vognetwork.com says
1581000	1583000	Today's headline, Loki loves a game
1583000	1585000	The Mayans have been proven to be right
1585000	1587000	Dude I love games all the time
1587000	1589000	Grand Theft Auto
1589000	1591000	Hello
1591000	1593000	By the way Halo 4 made me nauseous
1593000	1595000	If you're done with your gaming week
1595000	1597000	I want to quickly talk about mine
1597000	1599000	I don't have a whole lot of time
1599000	1601000	Because we're running a little late for Eddie's interview
1601000	1603000	Because we got a late start tonight
1603000	1605000	But I want to quickly talk about
1605000	1607000	A couple games because I did play some new stuff this week
1607000	1609000	One of them is Halo 4
1609000	1611000	Yes, me
1611000	1613000	Halo, uh huh, I bought it
1613000	1615000	Keep in mind
1615000	1617000	I've been out of the Halo franchise for a little bit
1617000	1619000	I didn't buy ODST, I didn't buy Anniversary
1619000	1621000	I didn't buy Reach, the last Halo game I bought was Halo 3
1621000	1623000	And I didn't love Halo 3
1623000	1625000	Because I didn't have a lot of friends
1625000	1627000	That were online playing the multiplayer
1627000	1629000	And for me that's kind of where it's at in Halo
1629000	1631000	I don't get into the story mode too much
1631000	1633000	So Halo 4
1633000	1635000	Is kind of a new boot to the series
1635000	1637000	Because it's a new developer
1637000	1639000	It's 343 Industries
1640000	1642000	I'm only through like the first two chapters
1642000	1644000	So I'm not going to try to speak with authority or anything
1644000	1646000	But I will say
1646000	1648000	It's interesting
1648000	1650000	I feel a little lost
1650000	1652000	Because I'm not as familiar with all the backstory
1652000	1654000	And so forth
1654000	1656000	But I can pick up enough of what's going on
1656000	1658000	That I'm not like hating it
1658000	1660000	And at the end of the day
1660000	1662000	The story is really about the relationship between
1662000	1664000	Master Chief and Cortana
1664000	1666000	Any review outlet that's talked about this game
1666000	1668000	Is going to tell you that
1668000	1670000	There's too much more to really get into the series
1670000	1672000	But for me
1672000	1674000	It's always been multiplayer
1674000	1676000	Is where it's at
1676000	1678000	And I've been having fun
1678000	1680000	There's a group of about four of us that have been playing multiplayer online
1680000	1682000	And we've been trying out all the modes
1682000	1684000	You know, King of the Hill, Oddball
1684000	1686000	All the stuff you know from the old games
1686000	1688000	Of course Slayer
1688000	1690000	But there's a couple fun new ones
1690000	1692000	And I gotta say
1692000	1694000	I had a great time playing Flood
1694000	1696000	Which is one of the new game modes
1696000	1698000	Flood, some of you are the Spartans
1698000	1700000	Like the normal guys
1700000	1702000	But some of you become the Flood
1702000	1704000	You become these like creatures that run really fast
1704000	1706000	And have swords
1706000	1708000	And basically it is a
1708000	1710000	Kill the Spartans as fast as you can
1710000	1712000	And then once you kill a Spartan
1712000	1714000	They become a Flood
1714000	1716000	So it's kind of one of those like devour
1716000	1718000	You know everybody as fast as you can
1718000	1720000	And convert them and whoever can survive the longest
1720000	1722000	Ultimately wins
1722000	1724000	But for some random ass reason
1724000	1726000	The creatures make horsey noises
1726000	1728000	Like they go
1728000	1730000	They make these noises like horses
1730000	1732000	When they're dying and stuff
1732000	1734000	It's the creepiest thing in the world
1734000	1736000	And hilarious
1736000	1738000	So for a good time
1738000	1740000	Just add Flood
1740000	1742000	And then there was this other mode we played
1742000	1744000	I think it was like Griffonball or something like that
1744000	1746000	Griffball
1746000	1748000	All the other ones have description
1748000	1750000	And for Griffball it said
1750000	1752000	Just add awesome
1752000	1754000	Something like that
1754000	1756000	So we go in this mode and all it is
1756000	1758000	Is you have the gigantic gravity hammers
1758000	1760000	You can either have a hammer
1760000	1762000	Or a sword
1762000	1764000	And it's just a game of
1764000	1766000	Get the ball into the goal
1766000	1768000	But you have these giant hammers
1768000	1770000	That you're either knocking the ball around with
1770000	1772000	Or the other players
1772000	1774000	And so that shit was really funny actually
1774000	1776000	Even though we got beat bad
1776000	1778000	Like it was Shane and I
1778000	1780000	Versus Spike
1780000	1782000	And Tim
1782000	1784000	It was two on two
1784000	1786000	They wiped the floor with us
1786000	1788000	Like five points to nothing
1788000	1790000	It was depressing
1790000	1792000	But yeah that was a good time
1792000	1794000	I enjoyed myself
1794000	1796000	So if multiplayer is where Halo is at for you
1796000	1798000	Then you're definitely going to enjoy
1798000	1800000	Halo 4 I think
1800000	1802000	The graphics are a step up
1802000	1804000	It's just fun again
1804000	1806000	But keep in mind I've been away from Halo
1806000	1808000	For a good three years
1809000	1811000	I'm sure the story mode is great too
1811000	1813000	You know
1813000	1815000	Everybody says great things about it on the internet
1815000	1817000	But I'm not as into the lore and all that stuff
1817000	1819000	So I'm like okay yeah
1819000	1821000	The presentation is really good
1821000	1823000	There's a pretty cool scene in the beginning
1823000	1825000	Where you're climbing up a wall and it's kind of neat
1825000	1827000	The other game I want to talk quickly about
1827000	1829000	Little Big Planet Karting I picked up on the PlayStation 3
1829000	1831000	I haven't played a lot of it
1831000	1833000	Because I've been too busy with multiplayer on Halo 4
1833000	1835000	But I like it
1835000	1837000	It really does feel like a fusion
1837000	1839000	Of ModNation Racers
1839000	1841000	And Little Big Planet
1841000	1843000	Which is to obviously no one's surprise
1843000	1845000	Because it's the same developers of ModNation Racers
1845000	1847000	With all the Little Big Planet stuff in it
1847000	1849000	It controls great
1849000	1851000	It's fun
1851000	1853000	I noticed there weren't a lot of people online to race against
1853000	1855000	I'm not sure what's up with that
1855000	1857000	Maybe because the game is so new and everybody is distracted with Halo 4
1857000	1859000	I was just on at a weird time
1859000	1861000	But yeah
1861000	1863000	So far I'm liking Little Big Planet Karting
1863000	1865000	But I need more time with it
1865000	1867000	To give you my full opinions
1867000	1869000	The other games I'll talk about real quick
1869000	1871000	Curiosity What's in the Cube
1871000	1873000	I don't think that's really a game
1873000	1875000	We shouldn't call it a game
1875000	1877000	It's just a weird thing
1877000	1879000	They're having those server problems left and right
1879000	1881000	Which is really unfortunate
1881000	1883000	But I like the zenness
1883000	1885000	Of being able to just sit there and
1885000	1887000	Pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop
1887000	1889000	And kind of figure out the way to get
1889000	1891000	Huge combos of coins and so forth
1891000	1893000	I was able to get enough coins
1893000	1895000	You can buy items that will let you break bricks faster
1895000	1897000	See that was a thing the shop wouldn't even open up for me
1897000	1899000	Because it was so lagged out
1899000	1901000	I got this pick
1901000	1903000	That let you do 3x3
1903000	1905000	Bricks when you would tap
1905000	1907000	And you can rack up your combos so much faster
1907000	1909000	When you do that
1909000	1911000	Doing the little random tappings are much more fruitful
1911000	1913000	When you do that so kind of neat
1913000	1915000	But anyway
1915000	1917000	Curiosity not really a game
1917000	1919000	And they're having a lot of server problems
1919000	1921000	But it's free
1921000	1923000	Bemani better than Yaris
1923000	1925000	Little bit
1925000	1927000	The one other thing I want to talk about
1927000	1929000	Since we are about to have a
1929000	1931000	Bemani-centric interview here in a minute
1931000	1933000	Reflectbeat is out on the
1933000	1935000	iOS systems now
1935000	1937000	And you can get that on iPad or iPhone
1937000	1939000	I've been playing a little bit of Reflectbeat on the iPad
1939000	1941000	I did not know much about this game honestly
1941000	1943000	I've been out of the loop of a lot of the Bemani stuff
1943000	1945000	So you know again
1945000	1947000	It's free you only get 3 songs
1947000	1949000	Because they're trying to sell you the song packs
1949000	1951000	But it was different
1951000	1953000	I want to try some like
1953000	1955000	Versus and try to like play against somebody
1955000	1957000	Because I think that would be where the game would
1957000	1959000	Because there's more of a versus element to it
1959000	1961000	Where if you hit certain notes
1961000	1963000	They'll actually bounce back to the other side
1963000	1965000	And the other player has to hit them so that's kind of neat
1965000	1967000	It was kind of fun
1967000	1969000	A little different
1969000	1971000	Alright anyhow
1971000	1973000	We are going to, I'm running a little late here
1973000	1975000	So I want to get this in here
1975000	1977000	An interview
1977000	1979000	And I'm so happy to welcome to the show
1979000	1983000	Eddie from BemaniStyle.com
1983000	1985000	A long running website about music gaming
1985000	1987000	And music game culture
1987000	1989000	I want to bring him on the line and talk to him about
1989000	1991000	What's going on in the music game world
1991000	1993000	Hey Eddie you there?
1993000	1995000	Yeah can you hear me?
1995000	1997000	Yeah we can hear you just fine, how you doing Eddie?
1997000	1999000	I'm doing alright
1999000	2001000	Thank you so much for coming on the show
2001000	2003000	It only took about 10 years right?
2003000	2005000	Just about yeah
2005000	2007000	We got an E3 and so forth
2007000	2009000	But just never really thought to get you on the show
2009000	2011000	Until now so welcome
2011000	2013000	Thanks I appreciate it
2013000	2015000	Alright well let's just
2015000	2017000	Let's start with some questions
2017000	2019000	If you guys have questions for Eddie I know we probably have some of the
2019000	2021000	BemaniStyle community listening tonight
2021000	2023000	And I know we have some long time fans of music gaming
2023000	2025000	Listening tonight
2025000	2027000	If you want to ask a question at live.bognetwork.com
2027000	2029000	Just pop into the chat room and ask away
2029000	2031000	We'll read some of the questions here
2031000	2033000	A little later
2033000	2035000	What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?
2035000	2037000	No no you have to ask him on topic
2037000	2039000	Not a six hour show
2039000	2041000	So Eddie tell us
2041000	2043000	A little bit about your website
2043000	2045000	Tell us about where BemaniStyle.com
2045000	2047000	Came from, how did it start?
2047000	2049000	Funny enough
2049000	2051000	It actually started
2051000	2053000	Kind of as a result of
2053000	2055000	DDR spot, I don't know if you guys remember that
2055000	2057000	Site or not but some of the old NorCal
2057000	2059000	Players started that up years ago
2059000	2061000	Kind of like a competitor to
2061000	2063000	DDRFreak and
2063000	2065000	Mike No
2065000	2067000	Was in Michigan for a tournament
2067000	2069000	Way back in like 2001
2069000	2071000	And we ran into each other
2071000	2073000	And got to talking and at the time it was like
2073000	2075000	Me, him
2075000	2077000	The owner of TeamGuilo.net
2077000	2079000	Which was a Canadian site and
2079000	2081000	A friend of mine from the New England
2081000	2083000	Area named Malcolm, we were all talking about making this
2083000	2085000	Just gigantic site
2085000	2087000	To cover all music games
2087000	2089000	Because as it had standed
2089000	2091000	DDR was being talked about
2091000	2093000	Like everyone was kind of ignoring the other games
2093000	2095000	And that wasn't really what I was jiving with personally
2095000	2097000	Because I liked the Five Key stuff a lot
2097000	2099000	And there was
2099000	2101000	A lot of ego that got in the way
2101000	2103000	From the other two sites
2103000	2105000	And nothing bad
2105000	2107000	It wasn't like we were fighting or anything
2107000	2109000	But there were a lot of arguments about the name and everything
2109000	2111000	So Malcolm and I just kind of splintered off
2111000	2113000	And decided to start BemaniStyle
2113000	2115000	You know, on our own
2115000	2117000	And it was an early effort by
2117000	2119000	Me, him, some guys from the Midwest
2119000	2121000	And a handful of people we knew in Japan
2121000	2123000	To just get more
2123000	2125000	You know, word out about the other series that people
2125000	2127000	Weren't playing at the time
2127000	2129000	You've been very successful with BemaniStyle.com
2129000	2131000	Because it's really evolved into a place now where
2131000	2133000	I know for a while you were doing
2133000	2135000	You were doing some type of record distribution
2135000	2137000	Or record stuff, right?
2137000	2139000	I'm still doing that actually
2139000	2141000	It was kind of like a weird situation
2141000	2143000	I did
2143000	2145000	Slakes CD in the US
2145000	2147000	Back in like 2006
2147000	2149000	And a year later we got in touch with
2149000	2151000	DJ Chucky and the guys from Groovy
2151000	2153000	About bringing them
2153000	2155000	Out to the US to play at Anime Central
2155000	2157000	And that kind of spiraled
2157000	2159000	Into us distributing their albums
2159000	2161000	In North America
2161000	2163000	More Japanese hardcore stuff
2163000	2165000	Not Bemani-centric
2165000	2167000	But ever since we did that we've had
2167000	2169000	M Project
2169000	2171000	DJ Chucky, No Chin, Groovy
2171000	2173000	Chorus K, Red Alice
2173000	2175000	Jackazid
2175000	2177000	Just a number of people have been featured in all these music games
2177000	2179000	Out to Chicago for the Anime Central
2179000	2181000	Show that we do every year
2181000	2183000	So that's kind of like where that project is
2183000	2185000	We're actually right now in the planning stages
2185000	2187000	For our 2013 show
2187000	2189000	So it's still going on
2189000	2191000	Awesome, so that's kind of the place to be as Anime Central
2191000	2193000	If you want to see some of these artists that kind of
2193000	2195000	Started in music games I guess
2195000	2197000	Or I guess maybe known over here
2197000	2199000	From that or whatever you want to say
2199000	2201000	Yeah, that's pretty much it
2201000	2203000	What do you think has kept Bemani Style
2203000	2205000	I mean, you know, we just saw DDR Freak
2205000	2207000	You know, you kind of mentioned that
2207000	2209000	Bemani Style kind of started as a
2209000	2211000	It was meant to be somewhat like DDR Freak
2211000	2213000	But more inclusive of the other music games
2213000	2215000	Well, obviously DDR Spot
2215000	2217000	And before they shut down a long time ago
2217000	2219000	DDR Freak just recently in the past year
2219000	2221000	Finally sunsetted and said
2221000	2223000	You know, party's over
2223000	2225000	How do you think Bemani Style
2225000	2227000	What's kept Bemani Style
2227000	2229000	Above that and
2230000	2232000	In light of these other sites sunsetting
2232000	2234000	Well, I mean, you know, one thing
2234000	2236000	When it comes to running a website
2236000	2238000	Ultimately if it closes that's the decision of the person
2238000	2240000	Who owns the website and quite frankly
2240000	2242000	You know, my feelings on it are
2242000	2244000	Even when I have my low points
2244000	2246000	Which, you know
2246000	2248000	Got us talking, what, a week ago
2248000	2250000	A Facebook post that I made about how
2250000	2252000	The community has been lately
2252000	2254000	Even when I've had my low points
2254000	2256000	I just look at it as though I've been doing this site for 10 years
2256000	2258000	How can you just walk away from something like that
2258000	2260000	Especially when people are still using it
2260000	2262000	So I think it's just a
2262000	2264000	There's a genuine interest from a lot of people
2264000	2266000	Who are really die hard fans for that
2266000	2268000	Information on, you know, the more
2268000	2270000	Global games, stuff that's not released over here
2270000	2272000	And then at the same time there are people who are more
2272000	2274000	Casual that are into maybe
2274000	2276000	Just the music and they like knowing when
2276000	2278000	New songs are coming out, they don't play the
2278000	2280000	Games, they just want to know about the music
2280000	2282000	I think it's a variety of things, but the community's kind of stuck with us
2282000	2284000	And I'm just really not
2284000	2286000	Ready to let it go, so
2286000	2288000	Just sticking with it as long as I can
2288000	2290000	Since you brought up Facebook
2290000	2292000	And all that, where is
2292000	2294000	The community at these days, you think
2294000	2296000	What is the music game community
2296000	2298000	It's split, it's kind of weird because
2298000	2300000	You kind of have splinter groups now
2300000	2302000	In regards to what games people are playing
2302000	2304000	And what mentalities everybody has
2304000	2306000	Konami
2306000	2308000	Has not really been doing a lot to help
2308000	2310000	The community over here in the US
2310000	2312000	They never really have
2312000	2314000	There have been attempts in the past
2314000	2316000	With Beatmania
2316000	2318000	And the home version DDR's that came out
2318000	2320000	Early on and DDR continuing on
2320000	2322000	For years, but ultimately
2322000	2324000	The hardcore fans
2324000	2326000	Kind of get the short
2326000	2328000	End of the stick in the sense that
2328000	2330000	They're very vocal about
2330000	2332000	What they want from the games and Konami
2332000	2334000	Has to kind of
2334000	2336000	Appease both the mainstream
2336000	2338000	And the hardcore fans
2338000	2340000	And I think they lean a little bit too much towards
2340000	2342000	The mainstream and not enough towards
2342000	2344000	The hardcore fans
2344000	2346000	So the hardcore fans have just kind of gotten
2346000	2348000	Sick of it, a lot of them
2348000	2350000	It's just like any other internet community
2350000	2352000	The more negative people
2352000	2354000	Tend to be the ones that stand out more
2354000	2356000	In conversation, as opposed to the people who are
2356000	2358000	Praising the work of the people making the games
2358000	2360000	Or whatever the subject matter is
2360000	2362000	So
2362000	2364000	On the outside it looks
2364000	2366000	As though the community has just
2366000	2368000	Degenerated to this massive
2368000	2370000	Negativity
2371000	2373000	They're just tired of not getting
2373000	2375000	Any of the games and being
2375000	2377000	Ignored and so on and so forth
2377000	2379000	So you run into situations like what's
2379000	2381000	Happening right now with the DJ Max
2381000	2383000	Community, who for the most part
2383000	2385000	Ever since Technica came out have just been
2385000	2387000	Growing at an exponential rate
2387000	2389000	And a lot of them are really fantastic people
2389000	2391000	But you'll see people that
2391000	2393000	Once anything goes wrong or something
2393000	2395000	Doesn't go their way
2395000	2397000	Everyone starts complaining
2397000	2399000	Or starts just outright
2399000	2401000	Talking shit about the company that makes the game
2401000	2403000	Not really looking at it from their perspective
2403000	2405000	But saying like, hey, this is what I want
2405000	2407000	Why aren't you doing what I want you to do
2407000	2409000	And so that tends to stand out over the people
2409000	2411000	Who are a little bit more
2411000	2413000	Positive and understanding about everything
2413000	2415000	So from the outside looking in
2415000	2417000	I think the music game community kind of comes off
2417000	2419000	As though it's not very
2419000	2421000	Welcoming as of late
2421000	2423000	And I've had my criticisms over
2423000	2425000	Just the general
2425000	2427000	Attitudes of people for a long time
2427000	2429000	I think there's still just a ton of love
2429000	2431000	For the games and the hardcore players
2431000	2433000	Are a little bit more vocal about
2433000	2435000	What they expect than the people who play them
2435000	2437000	A little bit more casually
2437000	2439000	Since you were talking about Konami
2439000	2441000	And kind of like the difficult position
2441000	2443000	They've been in for many years
2443000	2445000	Although I don't know, I kind of think that
2445000	2447000	All the United States progress
2447000	2449000	For DDR, anything they had going
2449000	2451000	For it kind of went away when
2451000	2453000	Redmond and Hawaii both went away
2453000	2455000	That was pretty much the end of that, right?
2455000	2457000	I wouldn't necessarily say that
2457000	2459000	I think that
2459000	2461000	From a player expectation
2461000	2463000	A lot of that went away because they lost that connection
2463000	2465000	I mean, when they were doing
2465000	2467000	The games in Redmond especially
2467000	2469000	The guys working on the games
2469000	2471000	Were fans of DDR
2471000	2473000	A lot of them were really old school
2473000	2475000	NorCal and SoCal players
2475000	2477000	So that connection to the community
2477000	2479000	Definitely went away and I think that caused
2479000	2481000	A lot of problems, but
2481000	2483000	I don't think that the momentum
2483000	2485000	Went away, so to speak
2485000	2487000	I think the momentum went away when
2487000	2489000	Konami wasn't really being as
2489000	2491000	Hands-on with certain projects
2491000	2493000	As they used to be
2493000	2495000	So you'd see things like the Wii games
2495000	2497000	Coming out, I think were a fantastic effort
2497000	2499000	I think they did a really good job with those
2499000	2501000	The Xbox and the PS3 versions were kind of
2501000	2503000	Whatever, the song lists weren't fantastic
2503000	2505000	But I mean, they were still very traditional
2505000	2507000	DDR games, so then you look at the arcade side of things
2507000	2509000	And
2509000	2511000	After not ever
2511000	2513000	Making an attempt in North America with the
2513000	2515000	Arcade releases
2515000	2517000	Before Extreme, I mean, there was
2517000	2519000	The original DDR 1.5 in the US
2519000	2521000	And then there was DDR USA
2521000	2523000	But honestly, neither of them were really
2523000	2525000	Valiant efforts on their behalf
2525000	2527000	They kind of ignored everything for a long time
2527000	2529000	And then the In the Groove thing happened
2529000	2531000	And there was a lot of just
2531000	2533000	I think a lot of people really resented
2533000	2535000	Them for that because they felt like
2535000	2537000	If you're not going to do anything, why are you taking away
2537000	2539000	Our only outlet for these games?
2539000	2541000	And then they did Supernova and Supernova 2
2541000	2543000	Which I personally think were great
2543000	2545000	And those two
2545000	2547000	Like those two games in particular I think were a really good
2547000	2549000	Effort on their behalf, but then X and X2
2549000	2551000	Came out and it was just letting the wrong
2551000	2553000	People handle the franchise
2553000	2555000	Handle the development of these cabinets
2555000	2557000	And do the release and everything
2557000	2559000	So we got kind of like a shoddy product
2559000	2561000	I mean, not even kind of a shoddy product
2561000	2563000	It was really a shoddy product
2563000	2565000	And a lot of people just
2565000	2567000	Kind of got fed up with it and walked away from it
2567000	2569000	And I mean, I want to clear this up too
2569000	2571000	In regards to the arcade stuff because I know a lot of people bring this up
2571000	2573000	But DDRX2
2573000	2575000	Kind of had the same problems as DDRX1
2575000	2577000	Did where they were
2577000	2579000	Lowering the cost of production
2579000	2581000	On the games and you could tell that
2581000	2583000	You know, the quality went down a lot
2583000	2585000	Especially in the dance pads and they made
2585000	2587000	A conscious effort to try
2587000	2589000	To fix the problems from X
2589000	2591000	To X2 because
2591000	2593000	Myself and some friends of mine were brought in
2593000	2595000	To consult with them specifically on the
2595000	2597000	Arcade release to make sure certain things were up to snuff
2597000	2599000	And when we had seen them
2599000	2601000	Everything was functioning
2601000	2603000	Perfectly fine and timing
2603000	2605000	Was fantastic and the games were actually really good quality
2605000	2607000	And X2 as a mix is like one of my favorites
2607000	2609000	In a long time and then
2609000	2611000	Somewhere between when we did our testing
2611000	2613000	Work with them and the actual release
2613000	2615000	Something changed and the
2615000	2617000	Final product that we got just ended up being this
2617000	2619000	Shoddy mess that, you know, constantly
2619000	2621000	Ends up in a state of disrepair and is almost
2621000	2623000	Unplayable
2623000	2625000	Let me go to the chat because there's quite a few comments
2625000	2627000	Going on in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com
2627000	2629000	First off, Shane Olinko
2629000	2631000	Is saying, we worked at Redwood City
2631000	2633000	Not Redmond, oops, my bad, sorry, I was thinking of the
2633000	2635000	Wrong video game company apparently, my bad, my bad
2635000	2637000	Mass effect on the brain?
2637000	2639000	Apparently, apparently
2639000	2641000	YYR saying, I still
2641000	2643000	Believe that Supernova happened because
2643000	2645000	In The Groove happened and a few folks agreeing
2645000	2647000	With him, what do you think?
2647000	2649000	I don't think that that's the case
2649000	2651000	At all actually, a lot of people
2651000	2653000	Look at that because of the timing
2653000	2655000	Of the whole thing, but
2655000	2657000	A lot of people also don't remember
2657000	2659000	What it was like when Extreme came out
2659000	2661000	And when Extreme was in testing
2661000	2663000	They had always been saying that
2663000	2665000	Extreme was kind of like a reboot for them
2665000	2667000	The whole, we're starting all over and
2667000	2669000	You know, kind of giving it a last hurrah
2669000	2671000	On that hardware, but I think a lot of what
2671000	2673000	Caused them to take a break for so long was
2673000	2675000	Just the rampant bootlegging of that game
2675000	2677000	Just all over the world, they were losing
2677000	2679000	So much money on it, so many potential sales
2679000	2681000	And a lot of time
2681000	2683000	Went into developing a little bit
2683000	2685000	More secure of a system
2685000	2687000	And in between
2687000	2689000	The period of time from Extreme to Supernova
2689000	2691000	They had released Dancing Stage Fusion
2691000	2693000	In the UK, which used kind of like the
2693000	2695000	Middleware hardware
2695000	2697000	It was the same hardware that Pop and Music
2697000	2699000	Used, so it was a PS2 based hardware
2699000	2701000	And it didn't use
2701000	2703000	Magic Gate Protection, but it was still pretty
2703000	2705000	Uncrackable, and finally
2705000	2707000	They settled on the hardware that was used
2707000	2709000	Which was basically a PS2 in a box
2709000	2711000	With an IO board that plugged into everything
2711000	2713000	And, you know, had its issues with
2713000	2715000	Hard drives dying and all that other crap
2715000	2717000	But I think a lot of the delay had more
2717000	2719000	To do with them just trying to get a lockdown
2719000	2721000	On the issues with all the bootlegging
2721000	2723000	Since we're talking about like
2723000	2725000	Reboots and all this stuff and where DDR
2725000	2727000	Is heading, you know, this news came up very
2727000	2729000	Recently, even after I asked you to come
2729000	2731000	On the show originally, that is that
2731000	2733000	There is this Dance Dance Revolution
2733000	2735000	Reboot that's location testing in Japan
2735000	2737000	Right now, what do you think about this?
2737000	2739000	Good idea for the series?
2739000	2741000	Bad idea? Not gonna go anywhere?
2741000	2743000	What do you think? Well, I think too many people are
2743000	2745000	Looking at it the wrong way. I mean, just because
2745000	2747000	They went back to naming it Dance Dance
2747000	2749000	Revolution doesn't necessarily mean it's a reboot
2749000	2751000	Um, you know
2751000	2753000	Pop and Music recently lost its
2753000	2755000	Numbering system. They dropped
2755000	2757000	The newest version is
2757000	2759000	Technically the 21st version, but there's no
2759000	2761000	21 anywhere on the banner
2761000	2763000	And Guitar Freaks and
2763000	2765000	Drum Mania are getting reset as
2765000	2767000	GITADORA, which is basically just like the
2767000	2769000	XG games in a shiny white cabinet
2769000	2771000	And no second player guitar on the Guitar Freaks
2771000	2773000	version. Are you saying that everything's going the way
2773000	2775000	Of Apple, where now it's the new DDR?
2775000	2777000	Uh, well
2777000	2779000	I think that's what people are gonna end up calling it
2779000	2781000	DDR 2013, which is
2781000	2783000	What people are calling it right now, but
2783000	2785000	I think that what they're doing is
2785000	2787000	They're actually kind of going the rock band model
2787000	2789000	With everything, and they're setting it up to be
2789000	2791000	A platform as opposed to being
2791000	2793000	Something that you get yearly upgrades
2793000	2795000	On. They have a new pricing
2795000	2797000	Model for the arcades in Japan that they just
2797000	2799000	Rolled out with the newest BeatMania, where
2799000	2801000	The arcades pay a subsidized rate
2801000	2803000	For the hardware and
2803000	2805000	The game itself, and then Konami
2805000	2807000	Kind of forces a profit share on the game
2807000	2809000	Through their Paselli and EMUsment networks
2809000	2811000	So every month the arcades
2811000	2813000	Give up a certain amount of their profits, but they're
2813000	2815000	Paying so much less for the game as a whole
2815000	2817000	And then throughout the course of the product's
2817000	2819000	Life, they'll upload a bunch of new
2819000	2821000	Songs and add some features
2821000	2823000	To the online network, do more unlock games
2823000	2825000	Or whatever the case may be, and they've already
2825000	2827000	Said that with the new DDR game, they've stated
2827000	2829000	That every
2829000	2831000	Six months or so, they're gonna push out
2831000	2833000	Another 30 or 40 songs and a UI
2833000	2835000	Update and possibly new features
2835000	2837000	And stuff, so I think that this is less
2837000	2839000	Of a reboot and more of a way to
2839000	2841000	Kind of
2841000	2843000	Restructure the way they do things
2843000	2845000	Based on how the arcade market
2845000	2847000	Has been declining everywhere
2847000	2849000	In the world, like it's like a conscious
2849000	2851000	Effort to try to do something that
2851000	2853000	Arcade operators can work with but doesn't
2853000	2855000	Leave them in the hole at the end of the day
2855000	2857000	So this is like
2857000	2859000	The 11th doctor of DDR
2859000	2861000	Kinda, sorta
2861000	2863000	It just sounds like they're forcing them basically to buy
2863000	2865000	An upgrade each year because it's being subsidized
2865000	2867000	Throughout the entire year, and with
2867000	2869000	The good faith that they're actually gonna put out
2869000	2871000	30 to 40 songs or whatever for the
2871000	2873000	Next update, which, let's be honest
2873000	2875000	Compared to what I've seen with the home
2875000	2877000	Releases and what they support DLC wise
2877000	2879000	That's
2879000	2881000	I'll be interested to see if they actually
2881000	2883000	Continue on with that after at least
2883000	2885000	One update
2885000	2887000	Honestly though, I don't think that that's gonna be the case
2887000	2889000	I don't think the CS games are at all
2889000	2891000	Indicative of what they're doing with the arcade stuff
2891000	2893000	Because they've been doing download content on the
2893000	2895000	Arcade games for a few versions now
2895000	2897000	2DX18 had
2897000	2899000	Like an add-on patch really really
2899000	2901000	Really late into its life with a bunch of
2901000	2903000	Ubeat and Reflectbeat songs on it and then
2903000	2905000	Linkle came out and Linkle had like 2 or 3
2905000	2907000	Song updates, so I don't think
2907000	2909000	That they're gonna give up on this
2909000	2911000	And you've gotta look at it from the perspective of
2911000	2913000	They're not really selling them upgrades anymore
2913000	2915000	It's
2915000	2917000	Cutting the cost of production and it's also
2917000	2919000	Cutting the cost of development on these titles
2919000	2921000	So there's no reason for them to not stick with it
2921000	2923000	Because it's constant profit
2923000	2925000	If people are continuing to play the
2925000	2927000	Games, then the operators are gonna
2927000	2929000	Stick with the service and they're gonna stay
2929000	2931000	Subscribed to the amusement network and everything
2931000	2933000	So it doesn't really benefit Konami at all
2933000	2935000	To not stick with it and at the same time
2935000	2937000	It costs them way less in development
2937000	2939000	To do something like this than it would for them
2939000	2941000	To crank out a new game every 8-12 months
2941000	2943000	Like they've done for the past 10 years
2943000	2945000	Of the series existence
2945000	2947000	How does something like that work though
2947000	2949000	For importers over in the US?
2949000	2951000	It's kind of left to be
2951000	2953000	Unsaid right now, I mean they haven't
2953000	2955000	They haven't been making any of the games really available
2955000	2957000	For a while, DDR was available
2957000	2959000	But it was available in such sketchy
2959000	2961000	Circumstances
2961000	2963000	You had to buy, for X and X2
2963000	2965000	You had to buy a new machine from Betzen
2965000	2967000	And then there were these crap machines that would break down
2967000	2969000	So you'd end up spending more money and repairing
2969000	2971000	The game than you would make back
2971000	2973000	And you would never pay off the machine
2973000	2975000	That happened to a lot of arcades out here
2975000	2977000	In regards to 2DX and Popin' Music
2977000	2979000	And Guitar Fricks and Drummania
2979000	2981000	UBeat and Reflectbeat don't even really exist
2981000	2983000	Over here outside of like
2983000	2985000	3 locations
2985000	2987000	One of them isn't even an arcade that have a UBeat machine
2987000	2989000	They've never been available
2989000	2991000	Out here as upgrade kits
2991000	2993000	Because historically there just wasn't a lot of interest
2993000	2995000	From the arcade operators
2995000	2997000	For it, like even when they did the location tests
2997000	2999000	For 2DX14
2999000	3001000	And they did the UBeat location tests down here in Southern California
3001000	3003000	So
3003000	3005000	For importers, it really
3005000	3007000	It's not
3007000	3009000	Changing the situation
3009000	3011000	For them at all
3011000	3013000	Because it's not like people have been importing the games for years anyway
3013000	3015000	I think the last one that was really readily imported
3015000	3017000	As like a legit game
3017000	3019000	Was maybe 2DX Red
3019000	3021000	And that was, I don't know, 2003, 2004
3021000	3023000	So
3023000	3025000	I don't think it's really going to affect them at all
3025000	3027000	At the same time though
3027000	3029000	I really can't get too much into it
3029000	3031000	But there is some stuff going on
3031000	3033000	In regards to Konami's American
3033000	3035000	Arcade operations
3035000	3037000	That I've, you know, become privy to
3037000	3039000	And it's not really so much of a guarantee
3039000	3041000	As much as it is
3041000	3043000	They're showing genuine interest in getting the stuff out here
3043000	3045000	Because round one
3045000	3047000	Which had just opened up its second location here in Southern California
3047000	3049000	The music games are actually
3049000	3051000	Like hand over fist making more money
3051000	3053000	Than any other arcade games in the location
3053000	3055000	This is including Redemption
3055000	3057000	So they've pretty much put a mandate out
3057000	3059000	That like all of their music games have to be up 100%
3059000	3061000	Of the time and if something goes down
3061000	3063000	It needs to be fixed like immediately
3063000	3065000	Even if the parts need to be ordered from Japan
3065000	3067000	And Konami's kind of latched on to this
3067000	3069000	And they've been shopping
3069000	3071000	They've been shopping the games around
3071000	3073000	There are arcade distributors out here
3073000	3075000	Nothing's, you know, set in stone
3075000	3077000	Or anything like that
3077000	3079000	But ever since they dropped the bets in as their lead distributor
3079000	3081000	They have been making attempts to try to find someone else out here
3081000	3083000	To handle the stuff
3083000	3085000	So it's really just kind of hard to say where it's going to go
3085000	3087000	At this point, you know
3087000	3089000	It's the state of the arcade industry
3089000	3091000	In North America
3091000	3093000	That nobody wants to take risks on anything
3093000	3095000	That's going to cost money
3095000	3097000	And I think that might end up hurting it more
3097000	3099000	Than Konami's unwillingness to release anything
3099000	3101000	Am I to infer from this a little bit
3101000	3103000	That maybe the, you know, we've talked about
3103000	3105000	Arcade, the arcade scene has been hurting
3105000	3107000	For such a long time here in the states
3107000	3109000	At least certainly the way we used to know it
3109000	3111000	Am I to infer from this that maybe music games
3111000	3113000	Are a way to get
3113000	3115000	Quote, quote, I'm using my quotey fingers
3115000	3117000	Real games back in the arcade
3117000	3119000	Well, you know, think back to 10 years ago
3119000	3121000	When DDR first started getting popular in the US
3121000	3123000	Arcades had been dead since
3123000	3125000	You know, Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter 2
3125000	3127000	So it's
3127000	3129000	I see it as a cycle
3129000	3131000	I see the whole arcade industry as a cycle
3131000	3133000	And not to deviate too much from the conversation
3133000	3135000	But, you know, the arcade industry
3135000	3137000	Just doesn't
3137000	3139000	A lot of the operators are old
3139000	3141000	Older guys, there's a handful of younger guys
3141000	3143000	Who have been starting up their own places
3143000	3145000	But a lot of arcade operators are older guys
3145000	3147000	That just don't want to take risks on stuff anymore
3147000	3149000	So redemption kind of rules
3149000	3151000	That's the king of the arcade space right now
3151000	3153000	Because that's what's making money
3153000	3155000	But there's a lot of laws that have been
3155000	3157000	Brought to light, not really
3157000	3159000	They're not actually laws, but there's a lot of laws that are being
3159000	3161000	Proposed right now to kind of kill the
3161000	3163000	Redemption market because it's essentially
3163000	3165000	Gambling for children
3165000	3167000	If something like that passes, it's going to
3167000	3169000	Cause a huge change in the arcade market
3169000	3171000	But, you know, there are certain
3171000	3173000	Things like, I listened to the last few episodes
3173000	3175000	And you guys are talking about Wreck-It Ralph
3175000	3177000	And I think
3177000	3179000	That the arcade industry as a whole
3179000	3181000	Missed its entire mark with that movie
3181000	3183000	I think that that would have been
3183000	3185000	A perfect chance for them to
3185000	3187000	Maybe appeal to Disney to do some more
3187000	3189000	Cross-promotion and get people out to their locations
3189000	3191000	And bring some life back to the arcades again
3191000	3193000	And nobody capitalized that at all
3193000	3195000	There's always a DVD release
3195000	3197000	Yeah, but, you know, it's still going to be limited
3197000	3199000	At that point, I think it's better to strike
3199000	3201000	When the iron's hot, I went to a movie
3201000	3203000	Theater up here to see it, and they had
3203000	3205000	Like two arcade games in the entire place
3205000	3207000	You'd think that a movie theater who's
3207000	3209000	Expected, and it's like the number one movie in America
3209000	3211000	Right now, like, wouldn't that get
3211000	3213000	You to go to your route operators
3213000	3215000	And be like, hey, get some more stuff in here right away
3215000	3217000	We've got some extra space for you, bring in
3217000	3219000	Like a Pac-Man or bring in a racing game
3219000	3221000	Or something like that
3221000	3223000	Or one of those Wreck-It Ralph cabinets that they made
3223000	3225000	You know, just for fun
3225000	3227000	They're limited, though, I think they only put out like 30 of them
3227000	3229000	Well, why? Why not make more?
3229000	3231000	It wouldn't be that expensive to set something up
3231000	3233000	I mean, if you can run the game on an iPad, then
3233000	3235000	Yeah, you know, it's a promotional thing
3235000	3237000	The game was free on iPad
3237000	3239000	I know you're big on Disney like all of us
3239000	3241000	But the thing about Electronica was that little arcade they had there
3241000	3243000	With all the perfect machines
3243000	3245000	Yeah, well
3245000	3247000	I still think Electronica kind of missed its point
3247000	3249000	A little bit, too
3249000	3251000	I mean, like, I'm really critical of the arcade industry
3251000	3253000	So I'm not really the right guy to talk about something like that
3253000	3255000	That's fine
3255000	3257000	You know, they
3257000	3259000	The thing with the Wreck-It Ralph machines is that
3259000	3261000	They're converted Donkey Kong cabinets
3261000	3263000	So it's not like there's like a
3263000	3265000	Pleather of those available for them to just
3265000	3267000	You know, fix up and clean up
3267000	3269000	And throw the game into
3269000	3271000	I'm sure they worked within their means to get that released
3271000	3273000	So, I mean, yeah, they could hobble
3273000	3275000	Something together and release it
3275000	3277000	But, you know, where I think they really missed the mark
3277000	3279000	And me and a friend of mine was talking about this at an arcade auction
3279000	3281000	Last week
3281000	3283000	Why didn't they make a game based on Sugar Rush?
3283000	3285000	How hard would it be to
3285000	3287000	Throw a skin on a racing game
3287000	3289000	And add in some of the features that were featured
3289000	3291000	In the movie that were kind of talked about with that game
3291000	3293000	And then push it out as an arcade game
3293000	3295000	Like, that's the missed
3295000	3297000	Cross-promotion opportunity of the year right there
3297000	3299000	You know, you market that in Japan
3299000	3301000	With AKB48 doing the soundtrack
3301000	3303000	And you're set
3303000	3305000	Well, it'd be the new maximum tune
3305000	3307000	I swear, I was listening to the end credits
3307000	3309000	Going, is that AKB48?
3309000	3311000	It is AKB48
3311000	3313000	Well, that was kind of big news in the J-pop community
3313000	3315000	Like, kind of how
3315000	3317000	Perfume being in Cars 2 was
3317000	3319000	You know, they kind of got a lot of people talking
3319000	3321000	I just think they're, I love the movie
3321000	3323000	It was fantastic, but I think the whole industry
3323000	3325000	Kind of missed a lot of points
3325000	3327000	All the cameos were fantastic
3327000	3329000	But I think, you know, people didn't really handle
3329000	3331000	The release of that movie properly
3331000	3333000	I don't think there was enough faith placed in it
3335000	3337000	I got just a couple more questions for you
3337000	3339000	And then I want to go to the chat to see if they have anything
3339000	3341000	I already see a few things popping up here
3341000	3344000	But I've been dying to ask you this for years
3344000	3346000	And this is a very controversial question
3346000	3348000	Within the community, but I have to know
3348000	3350000	What you think about this one being
3350000	3352000	You know, so vested in the community and so forth
3352000	3354000	So, and it's about Guitar Hero
3354000	3356000	Because, you know, and I know this is like
3356000	3358000	Hello five years ago, but
3358000	3360000	When this game took off, there was a lot of people
3360000	3362000	In the community, they thought
3362000	3364000	You know, Konami was robbed of Guitar Freaks
3364000	3366000	And Guitar Hero has just come in
3366000	3368000	And taken all the credit
3368000	3370000	We all remember that review that X-Play did
3370000	3372000	Of Beatmania that was ridiculous
3372000	3374000	Where they said it was ripping off Guitar Hero
3374000	3376000	And all that, do you think Guitar Hero
3376000	3378000	At the end of the day, was it a good thing?
3378000	3380000	Or was it a bad thing?
3380000	3382000	For American fans of Japanese music games?
3384000	3386000	I think Guitar Hero
3386000	3388000	Before Red Octane was purchased
3388000	3390000	By Activision was a fantastic thing
3390000	3392000	For the music game community in the US
3392000	3394000	When the game
3394000	3396000	Before the game was even announced
3396000	3398000	To the public, I got a chance
3398000	3400000	To see it
3400000	3402000	I was hooked up with the guys at Red Octane
3402000	3404000	They brought me in to see it like shortly after
3404000	3406000	In the Groove PS2 launch party
3406000	3408000	And I walked out of that
3408000	3410000	That viewing just completely blown away by it
3410000	3412000	Because it was
3412000	3414000	As far as a music game goes
3414000	3416000	In North America, it was exactly what it needed to be
3416000	3418000	Because it's got enough
3418000	3420000	There for both the hardcore player
3420000	3422000	Who wants to challenge
3422000	3424000	But it's got the music that the mainstream player
3424000	3426000	Can kind of latch onto
3426000	3428000	I still play rock band like crazy
3428000	3430000	So I think that it was a great thing
3430000	3432000	But I think once Activision took a hold of it
3432000	3434000	And then started milking the franchise
3434000	3436000	For everything it was worth
3436000	3438000	The eventual downfall of the whole
3438000	3440000	Band based music game
3440000	3442000	Like all together
3442000	3444000	I think that that was really kind of where they missed
3444000	3446000	Their mark and handled it
3446000	3448000	They didn't handle it right at all
3448000	3450000	But I think initially it was a great idea
3450000	3452000	And it's not really like Konami was robbed of it
3452000	3454000	They knew the game was coming out
3454000	3456000	And they made the conscious effort not to release it
3456000	3458000	And a lot of people don't remember this either
3458000	3460000	But back in 2000, Guitar Freaks was slated for release
3460000	3462000	In the US, I still have a receipt
3462000	3464000	Some here in all my random music game
3464000	3466000	Collectibles for a pre-order that I placed at
3466000	3468000	FYE in Cleveland, Ohio
3468000	3470000	Back in like, I want to say
3470000	3472000	March of 2000 for that game
3472000	3474000	And then it got cancelled like last minute
3474000	3476000	Well I remember playing the arcade version
3476000	3478000	All the time, the US releases
3478000	3480000	You know, and
3480000	3482000	What was it that someone was telling me
3482000	3484000	When I was still playing it
3484000	3486000	Oh yeah, I got my pre-order in
3486000	3488000	Basically what you were saying
3488000	3490000	But I remember when we got contacted
3490000	3492000	For them to do something for the local news
3492000	3494000	For Guitar Hero
3494000	3496000	At my house and they made me hide
3496000	3498000	My Guitar Freaks stuff
3498000	3500000	I think that's more of like a
3500000	3502000	Lawsuit issue than anything else
3502000	3504000	You know, Activision did kind of go
3504000	3506000	Not Activision, but Red Octane went around that whole issue
3506000	3508000	The right way
3508000	3510000	They worked with Konami to get the licensing cleared
3510000	3512000	For the release on that, unlike
3512000	3514000	Some previous music games have been done
3514000	3516000	So that's kind of weird to hear
3516000	3518000	Now I don't think Konami was really robbed of anything
3518000	3520000	I think that, you know, that was their fault
3520000	3522000	For not releasing the game when they had the opportunity
3522000	3524000	And really grabbing hold of that market early on
3524000	3526000	Absolutely
3526000	3528000	Especially if they were, if Red Octane was working with
3528000	3530000	Konami over the licensing then
3530000	3532000	They saw, they had their eyes open the whole time
3532000	3534000	Well yeah, and that's why Konami ended up
3534000	3536000	Producing the arcade cabinet
3536000	3538000	Part of the licensing agreement
3538000	3540000	That they had for that game
3540000	3542000	Was that Konami would take over the rights to produce
3542000	3544000	And, you know, build the arcade cabinets
3544000	3546000	For that title
3546000	3548000	Max Ninja in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com
3548000	3550000	Guitar Heroes 1, 2, and 3 are the best Guitar Hero games
3550000	3552000	After that, it just sucked
3552000	3554000	I wouldn't even really say
3554000	3556000	Guitar Hero 3 was that great
3556000	3558000	That was still never soft
3558000	3560000	It was better than any of their other offerings
3560000	3562000	But I still wouldn't say that it was like
3562000	3564000	The top tier of the franchise
3564000	3566000	It was definitely the cliff teetering game
3566000	3568000	Where it's like, oh, here we go, we're on our way down
3568000	3570000	Yeah, pretty much
3570000	3572000	I was gonna say, I wonder what part of the agreement
3572000	3574000	Between Activision and Konami
3574000	3576000	That they decided that they're gonna put out a really terrible
3576000	3578000	Music game called Rock Revolution
3578000	3580000	And then help the sales of Guitar Heroes
3580000	3582000	The stories I could tell you
3582000	3584000	That I've heard about that one
3584000	3586000	Cause I know guys that worked on that on both sides
3586000	3588000	In America and Japan
3588000	3590000	And the guys in America were like
3590000	3592000	Gung-ho, they wanted to make this
3592000	3594000	The best effort they ever possibly could have
3594000	3596000	And I don't know if you guys
3596000	3598000	Ever played the drum portion of that game
3598000	3600000	With the actual controller
3600000	3602000	But the drum controller that they made for Rock Revolution
3602000	3604000	Is the best
3604000	3606000	Retail drum controller
3606000	3608000	That comes packaged with one
3608000	3610000	Like it's better than the Guitar Hero
3610000	3612000	Drum controller, it's better than the Rock Band
3612000	3614000	Drum controller, it was awesome
3614000	3616000	But they produced so few of them
3616000	3618000	Like nobody really got a chance to get a hold of those
3618000	3620000	But one of the stories that I had heard about that game
3620000	3622000	Was that the guy who started that whole project
3622000	3624000	In Japan
3624000	3626000	Was actually doing it as like a quote unquote
3626000	3628000	Revenge project
3628000	3630000	Against the companies in America
3630000	3632000	That had put out these rock games
3632000	3634000	And I don't really know
3634000	3636000	What his meaning of revenge was
3636000	3638000	Like was it to release a really bad game
3638000	3640000	And punish the fans or was it like
3640000	3642000	To try to put something out that would
3642000	3644000	Take all the sales
3644000	3646000	That sounds like Wile E. Coyote kind of revenge
3646000	3648000	Where he builds the elaborate
3648000	3650000	Trap only to have a blow up in his face
3650000	3652000	Pretty much
3652000	3654000	We obviously
3654000	3656000	Would not be able to get through an interview with you
3656000	3658000	Without talking at least a little bit about
3658000	3660000	DJ Max
3660000	3662000	I have loved music games
3662000	3664000	For a very long time
3664000	3666000	When OLR went through
3666000	3668000	It's creative shift a few years ago
3668000	3670000	We kind of opened ourselves up to the different types of games
3670000	3672000	I have not been following the DJ Max
3672000	3674000	News as rabidly as I was
3674000	3676000	The earlier Konami series
3676000	3678000	Although when I saw
3678000	3680000	The Technica machine in the arcade
3680000	3682000	I thought it was a good time
3682000	3684000	And I know there's a lot of stuff that they've been trying to do
3684000	3686000	With the Vita and so forth
3686000	3688000	What do you think maybe an old school music game fan
3688000	3690000	Like me who's kind of turned away
3690000	3692000	From that scene a little bit
3692000	3694000	What do you think
3694000	3696000	Maybe I should be looking at in
3696000	3698000	DJ Max? Why should I maybe come back and
3698000	3700000	Give DJ Max a look?
3700000	3702000	Well it depends on which one you're going to play
3702000	3704000	If you're going to play Technica
3704000	3706000	Then that's kind of like a whole different can of worms
3706000	3708000	Than if you're going to play the portable games
3708000	3710000	Which obviously would take a little bit of
3710000	3712000	Importing and dusting off your PSP
3712000	3714000	I think with DJ Max
3714000	3716000	As a franchise
3716000	3718000	There's a lot of people out there that know that I work for Pentavision
3718000	3720000	So I don't want anyone to think that this is like a
3720000	3722000	Company shill kind of thing here
3722000	3724000	My attraction to the DJ Max franchise
3724000	3726000	Is kind of the same attraction that I have
3726000	3728000	To Konami's Bimani games
3728000	3730000	And that's the music that they use
3730000	3732000	In the game
3732000	3734000	It's a lot of original producers
3734000	3736000	Producing stuff under different genres
3736000	3738000	And there's a lot of variety to the music
3738000	3740000	In and of itself
3740000	3742000	My attraction to music games personally
3742000	3744000	Has a lot less to do with the gameplay
3744000	3746000	And a lot less to do with the music that they use
3746000	3748000	So that's kind of where I think the strong point of the DJ Max franchise
3748000	3750000	Is that they really have like a
3750000	3752000	Very very diverse
3752000	3754000	Song list across all of the games
3754000	3756000	Whereas a lot of the Konami games
3756000	3758000	Shy of pop and music stick with the genre
3758000	3760000	That is kind of reflective of the gameplay
3760000	3762000	Itself, so 2DX is a lot of
3762000	3764000	Electronic music, Guitar Freak Syndrome
3764000	3766000	And he has a lot of rock, so on and so forth
3766000	3768000	Now DJ Max has got everything from
3768000	3770000	Like hip-hop to R&B to like
3770000	3772000	A plethora
3772000	3774000	Of electronic genres
3774000	3776000	And you know
3776000	3778000	Hard rock music, punk rock music
3778000	3780000	Hardcore
3780000	3782000	Classic, I mean like it's
3782000	3784000	That's really where it shines for me
3784000	3786000	The gameplay in Technica
3786000	3788000	If you're speaking of that specifically
3788000	3790000	It's different
3790000	3792000	You know there's a lot to it that's similar to the other games
3792000	3794000	But the whole touchscreen interface
3794000	3796000	And the way that the interface of the game itself
3796000	3798000	Functions is different
3798000	3800000	And it was kind of fresh at the time that it came out
3800000	3802000	Obviously it's been you know 4 years since then
3802000	3804000	But it's very fresh
3804000	3806000	Compared to a lot of other music game interfaces
3806000	3808000	Out there and it's not too hard to
3808000	3810000	Pick up and just the way
3810000	3812000	That you interact with the game is very fun
3812000	3814000	So I would say you know if you're a fan
3814000	3816000	Of the music that's what you should be looking forward to
3816000	3818000	The most because there's just a ton of
3818000	3820000	Really fantastic music in those games
3820000	3822000	Alright well we've had Eddie on like way longer
3822000	3824000	Than we said we were going to have him on
3824000	3826000	But if he's down with it I want to get
3826000	3828000	A few questions from the chat room out
3828000	3830000	So live.vognetwork.com is the place to ask your questions
3830000	3832000	Let me ask this one
3832000	3834000	That was asked earlier from DasBacon
3834000	3836000	Who asked
3836000	3838000	You got a left check
3838000	3840000	I'm going to say beforehand by the way
3840000	3842000	He's my roommate and he works on the website
3842000	3844000	So his question is kind of like a midpoint
3844000	3846000	Loaded question alright
3846000	3848000	I'll ask it anyway since I didn't know that
3848000	3850000	And I thought it was a good question
3850000	3852000	What is the future of Bomani Style?
3852000	3854000	Well we're just
3854000	3856000	Kind of keep pushing forward really
3856000	3858000	We had a huge server outage earlier
3858000	3860000	In the year and
3860000	3862000	It caused us to lose all the
3862000	3864000	Original data
3864000	3866000	It's still out there it's not like the
3866000	3868000	Original hard drives died or anything like that
3868000	3870000	But we don't have access to the server that the site used to be
3870000	3872000	Hosted on due to a complication with our old host
3872000	3874000	So
3874000	3876000	You know there was like a good
3876000	3878000	Six months or so where I
3878000	3880000	Just kind of gave up on everything
3880000	3882000	And nothing was getting done
3882000	3884000	But just recently you know I've got
3884000	3886000	That bug again and I've got a few people helping us out
3886000	3888000	And we're going to just kind of push
3888000	3890000	Forward in getting the most
3890000	3892000	Recent version that we had been developing
3892000	3894000	For like the past two years finished and online
3894000	3896000	With the resources that we have available
3896000	3898000	And people will start seeing that soon
3898000	3900000	With the headline section rolling out
3900000	3902000	We've got a new machine location database
3902000	3904000	On deck
3904000	3906000	Score trackers
3906000	3908000	For just about every single game out there
3908000	3910000	I mean even ridiculous stuff
3910000	3912000	Like pop and stage will have a score tracker on the website
3912000	3914000	We're going to do
3914000	3916000	Like a greatly expanded
3916000	3918000	Sim file database because that was like one of the most
3918000	3920000	Popular things we had on the site with
3920000	3922000	New sorting options and just like
3922000	3924000	A lot better ways to promote
3924000	3926000	Your files than what we had
3926000	3928000	Before because there was a lot of really
3928000	3930000	Good stuff that would just get hidden amongst like
3930000	3932000	A sea of crap and
3932000	3934000	That's one of the things we definitely want to change
3934000	3936000	This time around once we get that going
3936000	3938000	Legend of Zaku wants to know is the
3938000	3940000	Bimani Land Ranch still open?
3940000	3942000	We moved
3942000	3944000	From the Bimani Land Ranch
3944000	3946000	Now we live in what we call the Bimani Land Resort
3946000	3948000	Second style
3948000	3950000	It's a
3950000	3952000	The old house was a ranch house in Anaheim
3952000	3954000	California and it was just a really big place
3954000	3956000	And we had like 30 arcade cabinets there
3956000	3958000	And the new house
3958000	3960000	It's not as open to the public as it used to be
3960000	3962000	Just because of space and we sold off some of the machines
3962000	3964000	But we still have all of the key machines
3964000	3966000	You know we keep them updated
3966000	3968000	And now we have a pool
3968000	3970000	A hot tub and a koi pond
3970000	3972000	And a nice atrium so it's like a
3972000	3974000	Really kind of a relaxed place to hang out
3974000	3976000	It's still open
3976000	3978000	If you contact me via email or Facebook
3978000	3980000	Or whatever if you're going to be in town
3980000	3982000	We can arrange to have you come over and hang out
3982000	3984000	Heck yeah we come to Disneyland down there all the time
3984000	3986000	We're going to come storm the place
3986000	3988000	If you guys come down here
3988000	3990000	And not hang out at my house
3990000	3992000	Let's see
3992000	3994000	Shane Olinko
3994000	3996000	Is asking a question
3996000	3998000	I'm young and cheek but I'll ask it anyway
3998000	4000000	Because a lot of people always kind of want to know
4000000	4002000	How do I break into the industry
4002000	4004000	How can I get hired at Pentavision
4004000	4006000	I don't even know if this is the one you can answer
4006000	4008000	I honestly don't even know man
4008000	4010000	I got hired on accident
4010000	4012000	Like honestly speaking I got brought in
4012000	4014000	With a bunch of friends of mine
4014000	4016000	To consult for Technica 2
4016000	4018000	When it first came out and we were helping them
4018000	4020000	With the Technica 2.5
4020000	4022000	Project that never actually ended up happening
4022000	4024000	And in one of the meetings
4024000	4026000	They were basically staying
4026000	4028000	They really liked
4028000	4030000	Or they appreciated all the help that we were giving them
4030000	4032000	And were like well we wish we could compensate you some way
4032000	4034000	And I was working for this just
4034000	4036000	Awful bankruptcy law firm
4036000	4038000	Doing all their online marketing and I was just like
4038000	4040000	Give me a job, get me out of my job
4040000	4042000	And it's cool, I'll do all this stuff for free
4042000	4044000	And they brought me on
4044000	4046000	Nice
4046000	4048000	So you just got to beg and ask a lot
4048000	4050000	Well it wasn't really
4050000	4052000	Like a begging kind of situation
4052000	4054000	They put it on the table first
4054000	4056000	I just said hey hire me
4056000	4058000	And it just ended up working out that way
4058000	4060000	You know Pentavision is a company
4060000	4062000	Here in the US specifically
4062000	4064000	They're really in tune
4064000	4066000	With the fans, they like listening to input
4066000	4068000	A lot and they really feel bad
4068000	4070000	When they do something that ends up disappointing
4070000	4072000	People
4072000	4074000	So really it's just a matter of like I'm sure
4074000	4076000	Whenever we end up hiring
4076000	4078000	Which isn't really something we have on deck right now
4078000	4080000	But whenever we end up hiring I'm sure
4080000	4082000	The doors will be open to members of the community
4082000	4084000	Who are passionate enough that have the skills
4084000	4086000	To want to work with us
4086000	4088000	So I guess just keep an eye out on the Pentavision
4088000	4090000	Global website
4090000	4092000	If we ever throw up any job postings
4092000	4094000	Give us a contact
4094000	4096000	Let me ask this question from somebody
4096000	4098000	They didn't change their nickname so I'll just call them 693
4098000	4100000	Because that's the number they got
4100000	4102000	What do you think is the future
4102000	4104000	What do you think is the future of console
4104000	4106000	Rhythm music games
4106000	4108000	And he follows up and says specifically
4108000	4110000	Ronnie CS games but I'm kind of interested
4110000	4112000	In the general sense
4112000	4114000	What do you think is the future of console music games
4114000	4116000	In North America
4116000	4118000	I really couldn't even give you
4118000	4120000	An honest answer
4120000	4122000	The market in the US has
4122000	4124000	Just proven itself to not be there
4124000	4126000	Especially as of late
4126000	4128000	Harmonix has a good thing going with
4128000	4130000	The Rock Band 3 setup
4130000	4132000	The game doesn't need anything else added to it
4132000	4134000	So just cranking out new songs is perfect
4134000	4136000	For their existing user base
4136000	4138000	And Dance Central
4140000	4142000	Dance Central and Just Dance
4142000	4144000	Those will probably continue to be
4144000	4146000	Yearly games just because of the necessity
4146000	4148000	Of releasing them on a disc
4148000	4150000	There's a lot of data that goes into
4150000	4152000	The moves and choreographing
4152000	4154000	The characters and stuff
4154000	4156000	So I'm sure those will continue to be on disc
4156000	4158000	But as far as hardcore music games
4158000	4160000	I can't be 100% certain
4160000	4162000	Of this and I know I'm gonna
4162000	4164000	Break wide open
4164000	4166000	Some news here but
4166000	4168000	Konami didn't show DDR at E3
4168000	4170000	This year and when I
4170000	4172000	Had asked them about it they had stated
4172000	4174000	That it was because they wanted to take the franchise
4174000	4176000	Back to the drawing board and figure out
4176000	4178000	A new way to do it that could
4178000	4180000	Cross both types of rhythm
4180000	4182000	Gamers
4182000	4184000	I've wanted to pitch that
4184000	4186000	I've been talking about that for a long time
4186000	4188000	Well they clearly stole it from you
4188000	4190000	Damn it I wanted to pitch something that was a cross
4190000	4192000	Between Dance Dance Revolution and Dance Masters
4192000	4194000	Basically kind of like what Dance Central is
4194000	4196000	So you've got some of the appeals to arcade fans
4196000	4198000	Some of the appeals to like
4198000	4200000	Just Dance stuff and then also on top of that
4200000	4202000	Have some sort of
4202000	4204000	I had envisioned
4204000	4206000	This kind of revolution adventure
4206000	4208000	Kind of taking their adventure mode
4208000	4210000	But way beyond where they had it
4210000	4212000	Alright let the man finish I want to hear E3 gossip
4212000	4214000	So anyway
4214000	4216000	They had told me that they wanted to take it back to the drawing board
4216000	4218000	I don't really know what that meant
4218000	4220000	And this wasn't really a confirmation from them
4220000	4222000	But through a mutual friend of mine
4222000	4224000	Or ours I should say
4224000	4226000	I found out
4226000	4228000	Maybe
4228000	4230000	Three or four weeks ago
4230000	4232000	That right around E3
4232000	4234000	I think maybe two weeks beforehand
4234000	4236000	That Naoki had quit Konami
4236000	4238000	And it's speculative on my behalf
4238000	4240000	But I would not be surprised
4240000	4242000	If that had something to do with the delay
4242000	4244000	In the game this year because he was the one
4244000	4246000	That was heading up that entire project
4246000	4248000	So I know since then
4248000	4250000	Things have been handed off to U1
4250000	4252000	Who's heading up DDR 2013
4252000	4254000	In the arcades
4254000	4256000	But yeah
4256000	4258000	As far as the US goes I really couldn't say
4258000	4260000	It's too hard to tell
4260000	4262000	I mean Pentavision we're releasing
4262000	4264000	DJ Max Technica Tune soon
4264000	4266000	But realistically
4266000	4268000	We're just not sure
4268000	4270000	How it's going to sell because the Vita
4270000	4272000	Is not a very widely performing
4272000	4274000	Platform right now
4274000	4276000	And it's been really hard
4276000	4278000	To market that game as a result of some of the
4278000	4280000	Contracts we have in place with our worldwide
4280000	4282000	Partners so the word hasn't gotten
4282000	4284000	Out about that title enough
4284000	4286000	In terms of Japanese music games
4286000	4288000	I don't
4288000	4290000	My honest opinion is I don't think they really
4290000	4292000	Need to do console versions for them
4292000	4294000	Anymore because they have the arcades
4294000	4296000	And I think that when you do
4296000	4298000	A console version of a game that is primarily
4298000	4300000	An arcade game like it is over there
4300000	4302000	You're just taking
4302000	4304000	Activity away from the arcades at that point
4304000	4306000	And so it's not to say
4306000	4308000	That I don't think Konami will ever do another
4308000	4310000	Console music game because obviously they're doing
4310000	4312000	You know Ubeat and Reflectbeat on the iPad
4312000	4314000	But I don't think that they really need to do
4314000	4316000	The console games I know that a lot of North
4316000	4318000	American fans hate me for saying that
4318000	4320000	And it definitely feel like they're owed
4320000	4322000	Those console games but that's not the way
4322000	4324000	The market works in Japan and since the games
4324000	4326000	Are primarily Japanese I think that
4326000	4328000	You know that's just kind of the state of
4328000	4330000	Where they're at
4330000	4332000	But without the console version of DDR how will I make my
4332000	4334000	Data
4334000	4336000	See they made that really
4336000	4338000	Crappy flash utility
4338000	4340000	For DDRX in the US
4340000	4342000	And a whole five people used it
4342000	4344000	So I'm sure there's
4344000	4346000	Ways around it it's not like people aren't clever
4346000	4348000	There's a guy out there that wrote a utility
4348000	4350000	That lets you create edits in StepMania
4350000	4352000	And then export them as data that you could use in the
4352000	4354000	Arcade cabinets so
4354000	4356000	People in the Bimani community are way too
4356000	4358000	Clever for their own good sometimes
4358000	4360000	See I know what the solution to everything is
4360000	4362000	To Para Para
4362000	4364000	Dance Masters is though
4364000	4366000	I actually like Dance Masters
4366000	4368000	Because of the Para Para
4368000	4370000	Well Dance Evolution came out as an arcade cabinet in Japan
4370000	4372000	And apparently it's one of those
4372000	4374000	Games that's not talked about widely but they get regular
4374000	4376000	Updates with new songs
4376000	4378000	So it's still kind of doing
4378000	4380000	Well I guess and it you know that was one of the
4380000	4382000	Questions that I asked Naoki when we talked at
4382000	4384000	E3 a few years ago when Dance Masters
4384000	4386000	Had been first released I said you know
4386000	4388000	I noticed that Night of Fire is in this game
4388000	4390000	And just you use the original
4390000	4392000	Routine for it
4392000	4394000	Is this influenced by Para Para
4394000	4396000	At all? And he was like no
4396000	4398000	No I worked on Para Para but it's not the same game
4398000	4400000	But it's Para Para it's essentially like the
4400000	4402000	Connect version of Para
4402000	4404000	Especially since they opened the old location of
4404000	4406000	Valfar up as Nikufar
4406000	4408000	You know the Para Para scene is coming back so
4408000	4410000	Yeah well they never really died
4410000	4412000	It just kind of like shrunk and now it's
4412000	4414000	Expanding again so
4414000	4416000	You know it's just one of those things I guess
4416000	4418000	Maybe when it gets big enough
4418000	4420000	To make them make notice again
4420000	4422000	And it's got like a type of music that it
4422000	4424000	Latches onto once again because I think
4424000	4426000	I don't know if like the Hyper
4426000	4428000	Or was it Hyper Techno stuff I don't know if that's
4428000	4430000	Still really as relevant as it was a few years ago
4430000	4432000	But I think if they latch onto
4432000	4434000	A new style of music and it becomes popular
4434000	4436000	In the mainstream of Japan again you could possibly
4436000	4438000	See another Para Para game get released
4438000	4440000	Well Eddie you've been a really good sport
4440000	4442000	On the show tonight I know we
4442000	4444000	Said we'd have you on for about 20 minutes
4444000	4446000	We're closer to 40 almost 45 now
4446000	4448000	So I want to thank you for taking the extra time
4448000	4450000	On the show tonight before we wrap up there is
4450000	4452000	A question I always ask all the guests that come on
4452000	4454000	The show what are
4454000	4456000	You playing these days and it doesn't even have to
4456000	4458000	Be music games unless it happens to be music games
4458000	4460000	What video games are you into right now?
4460000	4462000	I've been playing
4462000	4464000	A little bit of
4464000	4466000	New Super Mario Brothers 2
4466000	4468000	Although I haven't been able to get into it as much as
4468000	4470000	The original one for the DS
4470000	4472000	Actually
4472000	4474000	I feel kind of weird saying it
4474000	4476000	But I've been really addicted
4476000	4478000	To the Adventure Time turbo jumping
4478000	4480000	Fin game on iOS lately
4480000	4482000	It's such like a
4482000	4484000	It's an easy pick up and play like I could play it
4484000	4486000	For two minutes anywhere and then like I'm all
4486000	4488000	Over that and I love Adventure Time
4488000	4490000	I'm obsessed with it and I can't wait for the game coming out
4490000	4492000	Later this month but
4492000	4494000	Other than that
4494000	4496000	I'm going to start playing
4496000	4498000	Halo 4 soon and
4498000	4500000	I'm planning to pick up Super Paper Mario Sticker Star
4500000	4502000	Later on this week
4502000	4504000	Nice, well Eddie before we let you go
4504000	4506000	I want to get the plugs out there for your stuff
4506000	4508000	If you don't already know about this website
4508000	4510000	And you're into music game fans
4510000	4512000	Or if you're into music games I'm not sure how that's possible
4512000	4514000	But bimanistyle.com
4514000	4516000	Is the place to get all the latest and greatest
4516000	4518000	And what's going on in the music game scene especially

4520000	4522000	Oh yeah I mean well
4522000	4524000	I don't want to be
4524000	4526000	Egotistical about it there are other
4526000	4528000	Resources out there that have been doing a better job
4528000	4530000	Than us lately but we try our best
4530000	4532000	And we have a lot of
4532000	4534000	Friends in the industry so we come up with some
4534000	4536000	Pretty interesting stuff from time to time
4536000	4538000	So I'd say we're worth checking out
4538000	4540000	Anything else you want to plug while you're here on the show tonight?

4552000	4554000	We haven't announced the roster
4554000	4556000	Yet but the guys we have on deck a lot of them
4556000	4558000	Have had music in the most recent Konami
4558000	4560000	Music games and the parties we do are

4572000	4574000	Eddie
4574000	4576000	Does solo suck anyway?
4576000	4578000	Dude
4578000	4580000	You don't even need to ask me the question
4580000	4582000	Or the answer to that question everybody knows
4582000	4584000	That solo does suck anyway
4584000	4586000	And before I leave I do want to say this too
4586000	4588000	Apparently DJ Hung
4588000	4590000	Has been found working the shoe
4590000	4592000	Department of Nordstrom's in
4592000	4594000	Northern California recently
4594000	4596000	He was spotted not too long ago
4596000	4598000	And I really wanted to run into the
4598000	4600000	Department store and ask him that question
4600000	4602000	But he wasn't working the day that I was in town
4602000	4604000	I have memories
4604000	4606000	Good times. Eddie from

4640000	4642000	A couple of the

4650000	4652000	Shed whole people
4652000	4654000	It's really amazing to look
4654000	4656000	At like some of those people that we knew

4658000	4660000	And so forth and like what they're all doing now

4718000	4720000	At vog network dot com
4720000	4722000	Use the pass phrase detail
4722000	4724000	Let's move on with some news
4724000	4726000	Finally Loki
4726000	4728000	Hey that's alright it was a great great show
4728000	4730000	So far tonight absolutely fantastic
4730000	4732000	So let's talk a little bit about the Wii U because
4732000	4734000	We're right we're very close
4734000	4736000	To the Wii U launch one week from today
4736000	4738000	And of course there's still
4738000	4740000	Some of that stuff
4740000	4742000	Out there that we don't yet know
4742000	4744000	But mainly kind of tied with the whole network stuff
4744000	4746000	So first off what is
4746000	4748000	Nintendo network ID
4748000	4750000	And they actually have this whole kind of
4750000	4752000	Either Nintendo
4752000	4754000	Direct press conference
4754000	4756000	Or not even press conference like
4756000	4758000	Consumer conferencing
4758000	4760000	Stream web video whatever you want to call it
4760000	4762000	Anyways so they talked a little bit about it
4762000	4764000	Basically what it is is that the friend code
4764000	4766000	System has kind of been
4766000	4768000	It's gone away and now it's being replaced by this
4768000	4770000	Nintendo network ID
4770000	4772000	And what the ID is going to be used for is
4772000	4774000	Basically like the 3DS
4774000	4776000	They say smartphones
4776000	4778000	And PCs
4778000	4780000	Also of course
4780000	4782000	The Wii U
4782000	4784000	And it's going to be basically tied so that
4784000	4786000	You know you have all your software
4786000	4788000	You know logged into one thing
4788000	4790000	In layman's terms
4790000	4792000	It's basically going to be an account name
4792000	4794000	So like you know you have an Xbox Live
4794000	4796000	Or Playstation Network you have an account
4796000	4798000	All that stuff is tied to you're going to have an account
4798000	4800000	That's going to be a name and tie it to that
4800000	4802000	And you can make
4802000	4804000	Your friends and do all that stuff
4804000	4806000	So fantastic
4806000	4808000	Getting with the 21st century
4808000	4810000	And getting rid of stupid friend codes
4810000	4812000	Welcome to the big kids table
4812000	4814000	Nintendo yay
4814000	4816000	Mommy wow
4816000	4818000	Yes so it says basically
4818000	4820000	Users can exchange
4820000	4822000	You know the
4822000	4824000	Number of whatever this number is
4824000	4826000	Or
4826000	4828000	I guess just like a friends code
4828000	4830000	But then also they'll also be able to
4830000	4832000	Register friends I guess
4832000	4834000	They meet with Mevers so there may be a
4834000	4836000	Number still tied to your account
4836000	4838000	However I think they're going to have
4838000	4840000	A name to that as well
4840000	4842000	Or it's going to be just one number
4842000	4844000	That you're going to have for all future
4844000	4846000	Nintendo consoles or whatever
4846000	4848000	So there's that and then of course
4848000	4850000	That sounds a lot like the battle net battle tags
4850000	4852000	Just so you know like where you have like the
4852000	4854000	Name and then the random numbers at the end
4854000	4856000	So then also of course they've got
4856000	4858000	The Wii U chat stuff and they said that
4858000	4860000	Of course you're going to be able to talk to each other
4860000	4862000	Using chat they say that
4862000	4864000	I guess users
4864000	4866000	Will be able to draw images on the chat
4866000	4868000	Window while they talk and
4868000	4870000	Instant hilarity
4870000	4872000	Just add cocks
4872000	4874000	Because you know
4874000	4876000	That's what's going to happen. What else are people
4876000	4878000	Going to draw on the screens?
4878000	4880000	Like I'm going to have a video chat with
4880000	4882000	Loki and I'm going to draw a big dick
4882000	4884000	Right next to his head and it'll be hilarious
4884000	4886000	I think that
4886000	4888000	Photo I took at Fry's spells it out
4888000	4890000	Which one is this?
4890000	4892000	The one where I walked by the monitor and there was a big
4892000	4894000	Dick on it that someone drew
4894000	4896000	Of course
4896000	4898000	So yeah they have that stuff
4898000	4900000	Also they're saying that
4900000	4902000	That I guess people can
4902000	4904000	Place calls to each other through the Wii U chat
4904000	4906000	And there's going to be a light on the gamepad
4906000	4908000	They'll blink to indicate that there's an incoming
4908000	4910000	Call or something like that
4910000	4912000	It just sounds like it's very basic stuff that they're
4912000	4914000	Just describing in a very complex way that
4914000	4916000	You know makes it sound like
4916000	4918000	Oh hey look we've got video chat on our system
4918000	4920000	Now that everybody's had
4920000	4922000	This for years now but hey it's a new thing
4922000	4924000	And it's cutting edge because
4924000	4926000	We're now doing it
4926000	4928000	And then of course also
4928000	4930000	They have the new Mii Plaza
4930000	4932000	Which is now Mii Wara Wara
4932000	4934000	Or Wara Wara Plaza which I guess
4934000	4936000	Wara Wara means bustling
4936000	4938000	In Japanese
4938000	4940000	Was it Wara Wara?
4940000	4942000	Yes. Yeah that's going to change for the US
4942000	4944000	Yeah it's
4944000	4946000	Well actually apparently
4946000	4948000	The English name will be the
4948000	4950000	Wara Wara Plaza
4950000	4952000	I'm fine with that
4952000	4954000	Which the distant cousin of
4954000	4956000	Wuhu Island
4956000	4958000	Which why can't it be Mii Plaza?
4958000	4960000	Or the Wii U Plaza
4960000	4962000	Or the home screen
4962000	4964000	Or something like that
4964000	4966000	Why does it have to be something ridiculous?
4966000	4968000	No it should be Mii Gusta
4968000	4970000	But anyways
4970000	4972000	Yeah so it looks like
4972000	4974000	Basically your Mii Plaza that you had had
4974000	4976000	On the Wii
4976000	4978000	Now there's titles that
4978000	4980000	You may have played in the Wii U games
4980000	4982000	And stuff like that that they're huddling around
4982000	4984000	Which
4984000	4986000	I don't know
4986000	4988000	I'm not that excited about
4988000	4990000	But whatever
4990000	4992000	Not for me and also
4992000	4994000	Like they said before
4994000	4996000	This is going to be a day one download so
4996000	4998000	It won't actually come on your system
4998000	5000000	So if you don't have connection to the internet
5000000	5002000	Obviously you're not going to have any friends that are going to be on there
5002000	5004000	Well if you don't have a connection to the internet you're probably not
5004000	5006000	Going to be hearing this show
5006000	5008000	Well you may have a connection at work
5008000	5010000	Or something like that
5010000	5012000	I'm just saying
5012000	5014000	You may not have a connection to the internet at home
5014000	5016000	Or you know your console
5016000	5018000	May not be in an area
5018000	5020000	Maybe you're in the dark ages and you don't have
5020000	5022000	A wifi router or something like that
5022000	5024000	Or it just doesn't work through
5024000	5026000	Your walls or something
5026000	5028000	You may have connectivity issues
5028000	5030000	Either way
5030000	5032000	So you're going to have to download this as a day one
5032000	5034000	And I believe the internet browser
5034000	5036000	Is going to be part of that
5036000	5038000	So
5038000	5040000	Well
5040000	5042000	Moving on into other news
5042000	5044000	About Valve
5044000	5046000	I know we're all excited about whatever Valve's got
5046000	5048000	Going on next even though we have no idea what it could possibly be
5048000	5050000	Although I think we're all hoping it's like Half Life 3
5050000	5052000	Maybe
5052000	5054000	Gabe Newell apparently got a visit
5054000	5056000	This past week from
5056000	5058000	A bunch of users from 4chan.org
5058000	5060000	Uh oh
5060000	5062000	But the Vboard
5062000	5064000	Specifically went to go visit Gabe Newell
5064000	5066000	For his birthday
5066000	5068000	That's pretty hilarious
5068000	5070000	And asked him some questions
5070000	5072000	And of course there's YouTubes of it all over the internet
5072000	5074000	Newell did say no Half Life 3 questions
5074000	5076000	So that wasn't out there
5076000	5078000	But that doesn't mean they couldn't get some other questions
5078000	5080000	Such as is Valve working on a new
5080000	5082000	Source engine
5082000	5084000	And Newell said we've been working on a new engine stuff for a while
5084000	5086000	There was some
5086000	5088000	Garbled audio with subtitles that say
5088000	5090000	We've just been waiting for a game to roll it out with
5090000	5092000	And uh
5092000	5094000	There was another question asked saying
5094000	5096000	Is it more than just an extension to Source
5096000	5098000	Like is it an entirely new engine
5098000	5100000	And Gabe Newell said
5100000	5102000	Yeah
5102000	5104000	Apparently the rumor mill's still
5104000	5106000	Pumping out there on Source 2
5106000	5108000	This is after the uncovered code in August
5108000	5110000	Wouldn't Source 2 be awesome
5110000	5112000	For like you know launching a console
5112000	5114000	That they would be making themselves
5114000	5116000	Perhaps with a game called Half Life 3
5116000	5118000	That would sell a lot of consoles
5118000	5120000	Or you know whatever they're gonna be
5120000	5122000	I want Half Life Ponies
5122000	5124000	Well the game they are making is Ricochet 2
5124000	5126000	That was something that Gabe Newell did confirm
5126000	5128000	Is in development
5128000	5130000	Maybe that's the first game on the engine
5130000	5132000	That could be the game for 2014
5132000	5134000	Who knows
5134000	5136000	Alright let's move on with some more news
5136000	5138000	Dark Sakura
5138000	5140000	Oh Square
5140000	5142000	Oh Square
5142000	5144000	We need sad music
5144000	5146000	I don't know
5146000	5148000	What about Aerith dying music
5148000	5150000	Alright we can do
5150000	5152000	Alright I'll get some sad music
5152000	5154000	But that's happy music for me
5154000	5156000	Aerith living
5156000	5158000	Aerith living
5158000	5160000	Aerith living music I don't know
5160000	5162000	Yeah well Aerith dying music was happy for me
5162000	5164000	Because I hated her
5164000	5166000	Should just be the sound of the sword
5166000	5168000	Shink shink
5168000	5170000	Ten hours of
5170000	5172000	That's better
5172000	5174000	That's better
5174000	5176000	So Final Fantasy 14
5176000	5178000	Has come to an end
5178000	5180000	Dun dun dun
5180000	5182000	And um
5182000	5184000	Yeah instead of
5184000	5186000	Some of the stuff that people were promised
5186000	5188000	What they had was basically
5188000	5190000	Server farting
5190000	5192000	They got a really nice cinematic
5192000	5194000	I'm just imagining
5194000	5196000	I'm just imagining actual
5196000	5198000	Literal server farting
5198000	5200000	This is the end
5200000	5202000	Oh well this is
5202000	5204000	Unexpected
5204000	5206000	You shouldn't be making fart noises
5206000	5208000	Over this very sad song
5208000	5210000	This is happy music
5212000	5214000	Remember vote for us at the podcast awards
5218000	5220000	Yay she's
5220000	5222000	Dead awesome
5222000	5224000	My favorite part
5224000	5226000	My save file still works by the way
5226000	5228000	Anyway
5228000	5230000	People were basically
5230000	5232000	Logging on you
5232000	5234000	Those few loyal
5234000	5236000	Deluded people who were still
5236000	5238000	Into the game Hey I have friends that were still playing
5238000	5240000	Final Fantasy 14
5240000	5242000	You like what you like
5242000	5244000	I can't make fun of anybody this week
5244000	5246000	Because I've popped so many squares
5246000	5248000	On that curiosity cube
5248000	5250000	I can't judge anybody I'm sorry
5250000	5252000	What was the line from
5252000	5254000	Money Python? Don't know much about art
5254000	5256000	But I know what I like
5256000	5258000	So
5258000	5260000	I'm just going to read the quote
5260000	5262000	From one of the players
5262000	5264000	There were so many waiting to
5264000	5266000	Log in and fight in the promised epic battles
5266000	5268000	That Square Enix had to start
5268000	5270000	Turning players away based on subscription
5270000	5272000	End date
5272000	5274000	So those who were in had bad lag
5274000	5276000	Especially in menus and couldn't
5276000	5278000	Form parties
5278000	5280000	When they actually did get
5280000	5282000	To fight some of these epic
5282000	5284000	Monsters they were promised
5284000	5286000	They were
5286000	5288000	It was like these
5288000	5290000	Level 100 monsters that were only ever
5290000	5292000	Seen in cutscenes
5292000	5294000	They really couldn't get much
5294000	5296000	About it so basically the last server message
5296000	5298000	Just pretty much bleeped over and over
5298000	5300000	Again
5300000	5302000	Confound contact with main host
5302000	5304000	What a way to go
5304000	5306000	Yeah but there's a pretty nice
5306000	5308000	Cinematic up on Kotaku so go watch that
5308000	5310000	That's the only good thing to ever come out of Final Fantasy 14
5310000	5312000	Actually by pretty nice
5312000	5314000	Pretty fucking amazing
5314000	5316000	If you do watch the mag it's pretty epic
5316000	5318000	I'm very curious about
5318000	5320000	This realm reborn
5320000	5322000	I can't believe they went so far
5322000	5324000	As to just pull the fucking plug on 14
5324000	5326000	As it was and saying alright
5326000	5328000	Hold up you guys we got this
5328000	5330000	Just give us about 6 months to get it up and running again
5330000	5332000	Crazy
5332000	5334000	Alright we'll just do a real
5334000	5336000	Update this time instead of just
5336000	5338000	Poopooing out something
5338000	5340000	Alright well we'll see what happens
5340000	5342000	If it was worth the wait or if it is
5342000	5344000	Poopoo
5344000	5346000	In the meantime something a little closer
5346000	5348000	To look forward to this week's release dates
5348000	5350000	Oh my god
5350000	5352000	There's a little bit happening in the states this week
5352000	5354000	Just a tad
5354000	5356000	Bit considering that we've got the Wii U
5356000	5358000	Launched so there's like every god damn
5358000	5360000	Game coming out on the Wii U
5360000	5362000	All at one time let's talk about the big stuff
5362000	5364000	First of course obviously
5364000	5366000	The biggest game of the year
5366000	5368000	And this is probably by sales this is not
5368000	5370000	Necessarily unpopularity but it is pretty popular
5370000	5372000	As well Call of Duty Black Ops 2
5372000	5374000	Coming out on
5374000	5376000	Playstation 3, Xbox 360
5376000	5378000	The Wii U

5390000	5392000	And the Care Package with that quadcopter
5392000	5394000	Which looks cool
5394000	5396000	But I guarantee is very cheap
5396000	5398000	Cause they usually
5398000	5400000	Forget who they source to make that stuff
5400000	5402000	But it's been the same company each year
5402000	5404000	They make kids toys folks
5404000	5406000	Just saying

5626000	5628000	That's awful
5628000	5630000	With a lot of weird sound effects
5630000	5632000	Can we talk Skylanders Giants for a minute?

5642000	5644000	Dang, they are making bank off
5644000	5646000	Whoever thought of that

5722000	5724000	the love of god, that is it
5724000	5726000	Alright, let's go
5726000	5728000	There's a lot of talk in our chat room
5728000	5730000	I want to acknowledge the chat at live.vognetwork.com
5730000	5732000	kind of talking about Final Fantasy 14
5732000	5734000	to Jamie's story
5734000	5736000	Stan in chat asks
5736000	5738000	So Final Fantasy 14 is completely dead now
5738000	5740000	or is reborn replacing it?
5740000	5742000	The latter, reborn is replacing it
5742000	5744000	and yes, 14 is dead now
5744000	5746000	There is this gap happening
5746000	5748000	and YYR mentions it a little earlier in chat
5748000	5750000	with, what did he say?
5750000	5752000	They're really going to have to start over
5752000	5754000	Shouldn't they have wanted to at least retain
5754000	5756000	the small audience they had?
5756000	5758000	They are hoping they'll come back
5758000	5760000	and I think the ones that were
5760000	5762000	loyal to 14 until the very end
5762000	5764000	I think they will come back
5764000	5766000	I mean, for them to have held out on that game that long
5766000	5768000	they'll come back
5768000	5770000	Here's my prediction for the whole thing
5770000	5772000	I'll come back when they make 11
5772000	5774000	free to play
5774000	5776000	I'll withhold judgement until I see it
5776000	5778000	You know, if 14
5778000	5780000	the real one
5780000	5782000	which is really what this is now
5782000	5784000	I know they're calling it reborn
5784000	5786000	but they want us to see it as Final Fantasy 14
5786000	5788000	No, really this time
5788000	5790000	If it's a good game, then it's a good game
5790000	5792000	and I've got to play a good game, right?
5792000	5794000	We'll see
5794000	5796000	Alright, anyhow, moving to
5796000	5798000	Japan and the releases over there
5798000	5800000	there's quite a bit over there as well
5800000	5802000	Assassin's Creed 3 gets its Japanese release on the 15th
5802000	5804000	Some Platinum Collection titles
5804000	5806000	Dance Central connects sports, including
5806000	5808000	Season 2 and what they call the Ultimate Collection
5808000	5810000	which is both
5810000	5812000	Need for Speed Most Wanted gets a Criterion
5812000	5814000	release, Nike and Connect
5814000	5816000	Training and Steins Gate
5816000	5818000	Hiyoko Ruri no Darling
5818000	5820000	also gets a price reduction as well
5820000	5822000	so lots of price reductions and
5822000	5824000	Assassin's Creed 3, just in time for
5824000	5826000	the holidays. On the Playstation 3
5826000	5828000	also Assassin's Creed 3
5828000	5830000	Need for Speed Most Wanted and
5830000	5832000	Dream Club Complete
5832000	5834000	Edi Pion gets a release
5834000	5836000	that's from D3 on the Playstation 3
5836000	5838000	Going to the handhelds on the
5838000	5840000	Playstation Vita, Assassin's Creed 3
5840000	5842000	Lady Liberty is there, as well
5842000	5844000	as a Need for Speed Most Wanted release
5844000	5846000	and some new Vita
5846000	5848000	packs are coming out
5848000	5850000	the 3G Wi-Fi model
5850000	5852000	in Cosmic Red and Sapphire Blue
5852000	5854000	I remember reading about those earlier
5854000	5856000	those are finally seeing their release in Japan this week
5856000	5858000	so if you've been waiting for that pretty blue
5858000	5860000	PS Vita, Shane, there it is
5860000	5862000	On the
5862000	5864000	3DS
5864000	5866000	Aikatsu Cinderella lesson
5866000	5868000	comes out
5868000	5870000	I don't know what lesson they'll be teaching
5870000	5872000	Clean the toilets!
5872000	5874000	Change the firewood!
5874000	5876000	It's a game to teach you how to clean your house
5876000	5878000	That'd be hilarious
5878000	5880000	On the 3DS
5880000	5882000	Clean your house, or else no man will love you
5882000	5884000	Stop it
5884000	5886000	Unchained Blades Exiv comes out
5886000	5888000	Inazuma 11-123
5888000	5890000	Endou Mamoru Densetsu
5890000	5892000	and Monster Hunter 3G
5892000	5894000	gets a price reduction
5894000	5896000	that might be of interest to some people
5896000	5898000	Now, I'm looking at this and I don't think
5898000	5900000	this is like Cinderella like the fairy tale
5900000	5902000	This girl dressed up
5902000	5904000	in the little Playboy bunny outfit and pink
5904000	5906000	skirt, that's not what I think of
5906000	5908000	and I think of Cinderella
5908000	5910000	It looks like overtly shoujo manga style
5910000	5912000	Yeah, so I don't think
5912000	5914000	Disney Cinderella
5914000	5916000	I'm thinking something else
5916000	5918000	Isn't the lesson still the same?
5920000	5922000	Cinderella's lesson was if you want that man
5922000	5924000	you go get him
5924000	5926000	And you take lots of drugs
5926000	5928000	so you think that you're being
5928000	5930000	met by fairy godmothers
5958000	5960000	There's no Q
5960000	5962000	16th we have Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed
5962000	5964000	and Sims 3 The Seasons
5964000	5966000	You know what?
5966000	5968000	I quit Sims 3 after World Adventures
5968000	5970000	because I had way too much
5970000	5972000	custom content that it lagged my game
5972000	5974000	It was really
5974000	5976000	El Cubo is the re-release
5976000	5978000	of the GameCube, the Latin America version
5978000	5980000	For England
5980000	5982000	Well
5982000	5984000	they like to mix it up a bit
5984000	5986000	Somehow I don't think that's Castilian
5986000	5988000	Spanish
5988000	5990000	Hey, I may be an expert in Spanish
5990000	5992000	but that sounds pretty sound to me
5992000	5994000	El anything
5994000	5996000	is Spanish
5996000	5998000	It could be Portuguese
5998000	6000000	It could be
6000000	6002000	Or it could be
6002000	6004000	Moving On With More News, the classic game of the week
6004000	6006000	coming up real soon
6006000	6008000	Alright
6008000	6010000	As I kind of alluded to earlier
6010000	6012000	with the need to sell some of those
6012000	6014000	combo packs for UFC
6014000	6016000	THQ is not doing real well
6016000	6018000	In fact you may remember that
6018000	6020000	a while ago they actually had
6020000	6022000	unsplit
6022000	6024000	their stocks, a reverse
6024000	6026000	stock split, 10 to 1
6026000	6028000	taking all their, you know, 51 cent
6028000	6030000	share stocks and
6030000	6032000	combining them together to equal
6032000	6034000	$5.16 share
6034000	6036000	stocks
6036000	6038000	You know, because their stock price
6038000	6040000	fell so low that it was going to be delisted
6040000	6042000	Problem is
6042000	6044000	Now their stock has dropped
6044000	6046000	down to $1.74
6046000	6048000	42%
6048000	6050000	So
6050000	6052000	If you think about it
6052000	6054000	those stocks really wouldn't be worth crap
6054000	6056000	They'd be worth like $0.17
6056000	6058000	Good times
6058000	6060000	Good times, yeah
6060000	6062000	So that is unfortunate
6062000	6064000	And of course I'm sure it's not helping by the fact that
6064000	6066000	a lot of those
6066000	6068000	games have kind of
6068000	6070000	You know, oh I'm sorry
6070000	6072000	It closed down to $1.50
6072000	6074000	It dropped even further
6074000	6076000	So 50%
6076000	6078000	It's probably not helping that a lot of the games
6078000	6080000	that they were going to be coming out with
6080000	6082000	have been delayed
6082000	6084000	I understand why they're doing it
6084000	6086000	It's admirable
6086000	6088000	but at the same time
6088000	6090000	I'm kind of wondering
6090000	6092000	Damn, I hope you guys survive
6092000	6094000	all these delays
6094000	6096000	Well what's interesting, Legend of Zaku in our chatroom
6096000	6098000	at live.vognetwork.com says
6099000	6101000	Seriously, they'll be dead in six months
6101000	6103000	But Shadow Next Gen follows that up with
6103000	6105000	people said that six months ago
6105000	6107000	That's true, and the whole thing now
6107000	6109000	is that they want to
6109000	6111000	focus on quality, which is great
6111000	6113000	So South Park, Metro Last Light, and
6113000	6115000	Company of Heroes 2 have all been delayed
6115000	6117000	to the next fiscal year
6117000	6119000	So that doesn't necessarily mean that
6119000	6121000	they're not coming out, it just means that they're
6121000	6123000	delayed a few months
6123000	6125000	because originally this stuff was supposed to come out in the first quarter
6125000	6127000	of 2013
6127000	6129000	and even as
6129000	6131000	I alluded to
6131000	6133000	they were saying
6133000	6135000	When I joined THQ, the company made a public commitment
6135000	6137000	to the quality of titles
6137000	6139000	and we've always expected that
6139000	6141000	in some cases this would mean that more time
6141000	6143000	would be needed to make sure that every title
6143000	6145000	is of the highest possible quality
6145000	6147000	and our fourth quarter releases
6147000	6149000	are the first titles that I have
6149000	6151000	that have the ability to
6151000	6153000	materially impact an experience
6153000	6155000	told me that
6155000	6157000	games needed additional
6157000	6159000	development time to be market ready
6159000	6161000	Thank you for releasing games that
6161000	6163000	are polished as opposed to
6163000	6165000	just putting them out there because
6165000	6167000	eh, we won't make money
6167000	6169000	So let's hope that that actually
6169000	6171000	pays off and these games are even
6171000	6173000	better than what they would have been had they just
6173000	6175000	put them out when they were
6175000	6177000	ready to put them out
6177000	6179000	So we'll see
6179000	6181000	However, that's still not helping the fact that they
6181000	6183000	defaulted on their 50 million dollar loan
6183000	6185000	that they had
6185000	6187000	with Wells Fargo
6187000	6189000	So, not
6189000	6191000	too good
6191000	6193000	Sad trombone
6193000	6195000	Yes, so apparently they had
6195000	6197000	borrowed I guess 21 million
6197000	6199000	dollars from the credit that they had
6199000	6201000	and
6201000	6203000	I guess they had like this 50 million
6203000	6205000	dollar revolving credit and
6205000	6207000	yeah, not good
6207000	6209000	so
6209000	6211000	Hopefully they will be able to
6211000	6213000	recoup from all these losses and stuff
6213000	6215000	and put out some good games
6215000	6217000	I mean after all, South Park looks awesome
6217000	6219000	I'm not a big fan of Company of Heroes
6219000	6221000	but Metro Last Light looks pretty sweet
6221000	6223000	And you need a Saints Row 4
6223000	6225000	Right? That's what Rama in our chat room
6225000	6227000	just said
6227000	6229000	Rama in the chat, they better
6229000	6231000	give me my Saints Row 4 before
6231000	6233000	they go down like the claims
6233000	6235000	Saints Row, you know
6235000	6237000	what they were planning to do with that, the whole
6237000	6239000	enter the dominatrix thing, which to be honest
6239000	6241000	looked like shit
6241000	6243000	I would have still bought it, but it still looks like shit
6243000	6245000	but they're making a fourth
6245000	6247000	game that's supposed to be better
6247000	6249000	but at the same time they're saying they're kind of incorporating
6249000	6251000	all the stuff that was going to be in Saints Row
6251000	6253000	you know, enter the dominatrix
6253000	6255000	so it makes me worry that Saints Row
6255000	6257000	4 is going to just kind of feel like an expansion
6257000	6259000	on 3, which
6259000	6261000	not different enough for me, but I still
6261000	6263000	will buy it because I like Saints Row
6263000	6265000	but I will still be pissed off if it's just
6265000	6267000	a cash grab like the other
6267000	6269000	games have been, but hopefully they kind of learn from their
6269000	6271000	lesson, or didn't learn from their lesson because they made a lot
6271000	6273000	of money off of all the DLC
6273000	6275000	Alright, let's move on to some
6275000	6277000	announcements from Blizzard, who also had an earnings
6277000	6279000	call this week, Starcraft
6279000	6281000	2 Heart of the Swarm, this expansion
6281000	6283000	they've been working on for quite a while
6283000	6285000	is finally due out in the first
6285000	6287000	half of 2013
6287000	6289000	that's according to Mike Morhaime, who is the head
6289000	6291000	of Blizzard, he did make that announcement during
6291000	6293000	Activision's earnings call, saying that they are
6293000	6295000	quote, working hard towards a first half
6295000	6297000	2013 launch, that wouldn't be
6297000	6299000	too surprising to anyone who's been following Blizzard
6299000	6301000	for a while, they put out two big games
6301000	6303000	this year already between Diablo 3 and
6303000	6305000	Mists of Pandaria, so them
6305000	6307000	holding onto this for 2013 is no
6307000	6309000	surprise at all, I would think though it's
6309000	6311000	going to happen after the end of the fiscal quarter
6311000	6313000	to give them something to buoy up the next
6313000	6315000	fiscal year, but we'll see
6315000	6317000	we'll see, speaking of Diablo
6317000	6319000	3, they have surpassed 10 million
6319000	6321000	sold, and it was confirmed
6321000	6323000	to I'm sure no one's surprise
6323000	6325000	an expansion for Diablo 3
6325000	6327000	is in the works, I'd be
6327000	6329000	very curious to see how that expansion
6329000	6331000	does though, because let's not forget a lot of those
6331000	6333000	Diablo 3's, well, maybe that's not
6333000	6335000	I was going to say a lot, but it's more like
6335000	6337000	a million came through that annual
6337000	6339000	pass, and I guess 1 million out of 10 million
6339000	6341000	still 10% is pretty
6341000	6343000	you know, but I'd be very curious
6343000	6345000	Diablo 3 hasn't exactly had the warmest
6345000	6347000	reception either, it has its
6347000	6349000	fans, certainly, but I
6349000	6351000	just don't hear about it the same way
6351000	6353000	I heard the enthusiasm for Diablo 2
6353000	6355000	and I know some Diablo fans might want to challenge
6355000	6357000	me on that, and that's fine, but I just
6357000	6359000	I don't hear that same enthusiasm
6359000	6361000	that I heard behind part 2
6361000	6363000	so I'd be very curious how an expansion is going to do
6363000	6365000	for them, but I'm sure
6365000	6367000	it would be as well received as Starcraft 2
6367000	6369000	I mean, Starcraft 2 also, you know
6369000	6371000	it's popular, but not popular
6371000	6373000	like Starcraft 1 was
6373000	6375000	does that make sense? I don't know
6375000	6377000	also, a class action
6377000	6379000	lawsuit being filed against
6379000	6381000	Blizzard
6381000	6383000	you know, they make World of Warcraft
6383000	6385000	Starcraft, Diablo 3, and it has to
6385000	6387000	do with the authenticators
6387000	6389000	apparently
6389000	6391000	who are the guys that are
6391000	6393000	filing this lawsuit here?
6393000	6395000	it's
6395000	6397000	Carney, William Bates, Pullum
6397000	6399000	and Bowman PLLC
6399000	6401000	they are litigating Benjamin
6401000	6403000	Bell et al. versus Blizzard
6403000	6405000	Entertainment, saying that
6405000	6407000	all of this is negligent and deceptive
6407000	6409000	practices related to
6409000	6411000	Blizzard's customers' account security
6411000	6413000	the fact that for a while
6413000	6415000	you had to buy a keychain
6415000	6417000	authenticator for $6.50
6417000	6419000	technically you still do have to buy that
6419000	6421000	authenticator if you really want to protect your account
6421000	6423000	however, what I'm not hearing about
6423000	6425000	in this lawsuit is, oh yeah, there's the
6425000	6427000	free one on the smartphones
6427000	6429000	and so forth. Don't they have a PC app now?
6429000	6431000	I don't think so, just on smartphones
6431000	6433000	maybe, I don't know
6433000	6435000	I've had the smartphone one for so long, I don't know
6435000	6437000	the claim is drawing
6437000	6439000	against the August 9th
6439000	6441000	battle net breach
6441000	6443000	where Blizzard, they actually
6443000	6445000	disclosed that yes, people got in
6445000	6447000	they didn't get any sensitive information
6447000	6449000	but were making people reset their passwords
6449000	6451000	anyways, and the
6451000	6453000	lawsuit saying that Blizzard's negligence
6453000	6455000	in maintaining proper
6455000	6457000	security protocols is resulting
6457000	6459000	in deceptive upselling
6459000	6461000	so in other words, because Blizzard
6461000	6463000	can't protect their shit, or is
6463000	6465000	negligent in protecting their shit, they're selling
6465000	6467000	you an authenticator so that
6467000	6469000	they're making you buy this to protect
6469000	6471000	your shit. That's gonna get thrown out because
6471000	6473000	honestly, my
6473000	6475000	I've had an authenticator
6475000	6477000	for years and it hasn't done
6477000	6479000	a damn thing for
6479000	6481000	anyone getting it and getting any information
6481000	6483000	that had, the authenticator
6483000	6485000	had nothing to do with it
6485000	6487000	it wasn't
6487000	6489000	like, I think that
6489000	6491000	they got encrypted data
6491000	6493000	was it nothing solid? And it was anything
6493000	6495000	that could have been changed immediately
6495000	6497000	that wouldn't have changed his present level of
6497000	6499000	security. Well, here's the thing though
6499000	6501000	I mean, as much as I do think
6501000	6503000	I agree with you, it's gonna get thrown out of court
6503000	6505000	but I would like to know
6505000	6507000	why were so many Blizzard
6507000	6509000	accounts hacked before authenticators
6509000	6511000	before the mobile authenticator
6511000	6513000	came out? Because there was about a year gap
6513000	6515000	where you only had the
6515000	6517000	$6.50 ones, and as a Warcraft
6517000	6519000	player, I did feel like
6519000	6521000	why are they making me buy an
6521000	6523000	authenticator when they can't protect my shit?
6523000	6525000	You know, and I was like
6525000	6527000	why are so many people getting hacked? What happened
6527000	6529000	here? How did all our passwords get out?
6529000	6531000	I kinda would like that to come to light
6531000	6533000	I would like to know, how many million people
6533000	6535000	have had to call Blizzard because of an account breach?
6535000	6537000	Granted, I think
6537000	6539000	that the authenticator was more put out as something
6539000	6541000	that was for peace of mind
6541000	6543000	because I've done remote work
6543000	6545000	where I had to have an onsite
6545000	6547000	authenticator to get into the server
6547000	6549000	so it's basically an added
6549000	6551000	layer of protection on
6551000	6553000	user side. I think that
6553000	6555000	it doesn't really matter
6555000	6557000	how much security you
6557000	6559000	have on the website. If someone wants to get in, they're gonna
6559000	6561000	get in. So this
6561000	6563000	basically just gives you an extra
6563000	6565000	layer.
6565000	6567000	If anything, I would think that the authenticator price
6567000	6569000	was just to cover the cost of the actual authenticator
6569000	6571000	I don't think they were actually profiting off of it because
6571000	6573000	it was
6573000	6575000	something that required having
6575000	6577000	a device
6577000	6579000	in your hands to basically
6579000	6581000	pair the random numbers
6581000	6583000	with so
6583000	6585000	it's not like something that you
6585000	6587000	obviously, once smartphones
6587000	6589000	came out to the masses
6589000	6591000	and everything like that, they could do an app
6591000	6593000	instead but
6593000	6595000	that's probably why they had to sell it in the first place
6595000	6597000	because they don't want to lose $6.50 on every single
6597000	6599000	one they send out for people. Granted
6599000	6601000	it didn't seem to help for it. They should have just
6601000	6603000	included it in the collector's edition though
6603000	6605000	I don't know, I don't understand why they just didn't
6605000	6607000	include it. Did they do that actually in some of them? No.
6607000	6609000	I thought that they had one of the expansions that had an
6609000	6611000	authenticator in there. I don't think it was
6611000	6613000	Warcraft.
6613000	6615000	Might have been Starcraft, but I don't remember.
6615000	6617000	I don't know, they were just handing them out at cons.
6617000	6619000	Yeah, but that's different.
6619000	6621000	Alright, anyhow, we need to
6621000	6623000	take a time back into
6623000	6625000	classic gaming and classic games history
6625000	6627000	and remember when things weren't so
6627000	6629000	simple and so much shit was getting hacked.
6629000	6631000	At least I don't think this game
6631000	6633000	ever got hacked.
6633000	6635000	It stole your credit card information.
6635000	6637000	It's the classic game of the week.
6637000	6639000	Every week DarkSakura goes into the vault
6639000	6641000	and finds a classic game that she thinks, hey
6641000	6643000	you little brats.
6643000	6645000	This one smells like rotten fruit. Play this game
6645000	6647000	or I'll kill you.
6647000	6649000	Get off my lawn. Go play a game.
6649000	6651000	I'll kill you like you're Eris.
6651000	6653000	Eris.
6653000	6655000	Hey, even in Wreck-It Ralph
6655000	6657000	they got it right. Murica.
6657000	6659000	In
6659000	6661000	Murica we say Eris.
6661000	6663000	Alright, what is the classic game of the week?
6663000	6665000	Super Pac-Man.
6665000	6667000	I like this one.
6667000	6669000	I'm surprised I haven't done it because I actually
6669000	6671000	really like Super Pac-Man.
6671000	6673000	Actually the thing that I linked is basically
6673000	6675000	someone figuring out the ghost patterns in the game.
6675000	6677000	And totally manipulating
6677000	6679000	a full game.
6679000	6681000	But anyway
6681000	6683000	in Super Pac-Man it was
6683000	6685000	the second game
6685000	6687000	in the series that was actually done by
6687000	6689000	Namco. Ms. Pac-Man
6689000	6691000	was done by Midway.
6691000	6693000	So this is a true
6693000	6695000	Namco sequel
6695000	6697000	but you know people didn't really care
6697000	6699000	for it as much because it changed the gameplay
6699000	6701000	really radically.
6701000	6703000	It actually
6703000	6705000	in the game you actually went around
6705000	6707000	and ate fruit.
6707000	6709000	Instead of the little power pills.
6709000	6711000	And then you did get
6711000	6713000	special pellets.
6713000	6715000	You had your
6715000	6717000	regular power pills which you could use to
6717000	6719000	eat ghosts. You had keys
6719000	6721000	that you could get to unlock doors
6721000	6723000	so that you could get to the fruits
6723000	6725000	inside. And then
6725000	6727000	you had super pellets. And if you got the super
6727000	6729000	pellet then you would turn into Super
6729000	6731000	Pac-Man and could go through doors and fly
6731000	6733000	over everything. And you had a button
6733000	6735000	that would make you go faster.
6735000	6737000	On top of that
6737000	6739000	there was a little neat, I thought it was a
6739000	6741000	neat little effect where the ghosts would kind of flatten
6741000	6743000	down a bit to make it look like you were really
6743000	6745000	flying over them.
6745000	6747000	Now
6747000	6749000	you could not eat a ghost
6749000	6751000	as Super Pac-Man
6751000	6753000	but if you ate a power pill
6753000	6755000	like a regular power pill
6755000	6757000	while you were
6757000	6759000	in super mode then you could eat ghosts.
6761000	6763000	The big thing about
6763000	6765000	that is you also had bonus
6765000	6767000	levels too after every
6767000	6769000	second level. Where basically you just try
6769000	6771000	to go through and eat the fruit and everything
6771000	6773000	as fast as you can.
6773000	6775000	With this one
6775000	6777000	it's actually one
6777000	6779000	of the first Pac-Man games
6779000	6781000	that used the Motorola 6809 processor.
6781000	6783000	The previous one used the
6783000	6785000	Z80. And so this went
6785000	6787000	into the same category as
6787000	6789000	Galaxian for the conversion class.
6791000	6793000	However, it didn't
6793000	6795000	really prove to be very successful
6795000	6797000	because it was actually
6797000	6799000	very different than the usual
6799000	6801000	gameplay. It was kind of fucking weird actually.
6801000	6803000	It was. Pac-Man Plus
6803000	6805000	which was just an updated version of the original
6805000	6807000	I mean kind of like Ms. Pac-Man
6807000	6809000	basically
6809000	6811000	outsold it. Midway also
6811000	6813000	did Junior Pac-Man which
6813000	6815000	also went on the old Z80
6815000	6817000	processor and
6817000	6819000	that one also went to be a very
6819000	6821000	successful Pac-Man game.
6821000	6823000	However, they do say that the AI
6823000	6825000	for Super Pac-Man is
6825000	6827000	one of the best of that time.
6827000	6829000	Super
6829000	6831000	Pac-Man has been out on a lot of
6831000	6833000	different systems. In 84 there was
6833000	6835000	a port for the Atari 5200
6835000	6837000	but it never came out because
6837000	6839000	the video game crashed. Why is he eating shoes
6839000	6841000	in this level? You don't eat shoes. I don't
6841000	6843000	know. I get the donuts and the burgers
6843000	6845000	and the apples but shoes?
6845000	6847000	Don't eat shoes. Leather.
6847000	6849000	In
6849000	6851000	1988 there was a Dawson Commodore 64
6851000	6853000	version that came out by Thunder Mountain.
6853000	6855000	Did you have this file? F yeah.
6855000	6857000	In
6857000	6859000	96 it showed up
6859000	6861000	on the A for the Namco
6861000	6863000	Museum arcade compilation
6863000	6865000	on the Playstation. In 98
6865000	6867000	it came out for Namco History volume 3
6867000	6869000	and that was
6869000	6871000	on the PC in Japan only. In 99
6871000	6873000	Super Pac-Man was released
6873000	6875000	with Ms. Pac-Man in Ms. Pac-Man
6875000	6877000	Special Color Edition for the Game Boy Color.
6877000	6879000	I had that. I played the crap out of it.
6879000	6881000	2006
6881000	6883000	there was a plug and play Super Pac-Man
6883000	6885000	that included that along with
6885000	6887000	Pac-Man, Pac-Man Plus, and Pac and Pal
6887000	6889000	which honestly Pac and Pal is seriously
6889000	6891000	not one of my favorites.
6891000	6893000	It also
6893000	6895000	came in the TV Games Pac-Man
6895000	6897000	Gold edition and the Retro Arcade.
6897000	6899000	Namco has also done
6899000	6901000	a portable version for cell phones
6901000	6903000	that come out on
6903000	6905000	that are put out by Sprint.
6905000	6907000	Sprint and Namco actually
6907000	6909000	had a sweepstakes where you could win
6909000	6911000	a Volkswagen new Beetle customized
6911000	6913000	Super Pac-Man art and
6913000	6915000	it was on display at E3 in 2006.
6915000	6917000	Do you remember this?
6917000	6919000	The Beetle with the
6919000	6921000	Super Pac-Man stuff? I do.
6921000	6923000	Yeah.
6923000	6925000	It ended
6925000	6927000	on July 31, 2006.
6927000	6929000	There was a Palm PDA version
6929000	6931000	that was Super Pac-Man at Handango.
6931000	6933000	Whatever.
6933000	6935000	There was another
6935000	6937000	release with Pac and Pal, Pac and Roll, and Pac-Mania
6937000	6939000	on Namco Museum
6939000	6941000	Remix.
6941000	6943000	Super Pac-Man is now out
6943000	6945000	on mobile films with 3D graphics
6945000	6947000	and better sound effects.
6947000	6949000	And then we have it on the Namco Museum Virtual Arcade
6949000	6951000	for Xbox 360 that came out in 2008.
6951000	6953000	So there you go.
6953000	6955000	Super Pac-Man. There it is, your classic
6955000	6957000	game of the week, Super Pac-Man.
6957000	6959000	I liked this one, even though it was really weird.
6959000	6961000	It was weird. I liked it.
6961000	6963000	You know how I feel about
6963000	6965000	weird. I love that cut scene.
6965000	6967000	He's like, grin.
6967000	6969000	Where a giant ball of
6969000	6971000	Pac-Man falls on the ghost, they turn blue and squish.
6971000	6973000	Don't eat mushrooms! Some of them are
6973000	6975000	poisonous! But what if they're shiitake?
6975000	6977000	Shiitake are delicious. I guess that's alright.
6977000	6979000	I made the best dinner that was
6979000	6981000	shiitake mushrooms, enoki mushrooms,
6981000	6983000	and, um,
6983000	6985000	I can't remember, but
6985000	6987000	there are these other little mushrooms that kind of join at the base
6987000	6989000	and you have to cut the base off. It was so good, anyway.
6989000	6991000	The front lawn mushrooms.
6991000	6993000	No, not front lawn mushrooms.
6993000	6995000	Alright, anyhow.
6995000	6997000	Alright, Super Pac-Man,
6997000	6999000	your classic game of the week,
6999000	7001000	in a million different Namco
7001000	7003000	collections, as Jamie mentioned
7003000	7005000	there a little bit ago.
7005000	7007000	We're actually not taking a break tonight.
7007000	7009000	We have another interview,
7009000	7011000	and this one's prior taped.
7011000	7013000	This is actually coming to us from
7013000	7015000	DJ Rama S,
7015000	7017000	and Anime Jam Session,
7017000	7019000	which is a show you can hear at the Voice
7019000	7021000	of Geeks Network, or vognetwork.com,
7021000	7023000	on Tuesday nights, replaying
7023000	7025000	on Thursday mornings, and
7025000	7027000	at a recent convention,
7027000	7029000	Rama got this interview with
7029000	7031000	Jen, and she is with
7031000	7033000	the website, I don't want to
7033000	7035000	mess this up, it's ggvogue.com
7035000	7037000	ggvogue.com
7037000	7039000	That is girl gamer
7039000	7041000	vogue, and Rama is gonna
7041000	7043000	ask her in this interview some questions about
7043000	7045000	the website, and why she started
7045000	7047000	it, and all that good stuff, so
7047000	7049000	take it away. DJ Rama S will be back
7049000	7051000	after this interview with more of
7051000	7053000	Orange Lounge Radio. It's about a ten minute interview,
7053000	7055000	so we'll be back after this.
7081000	7083000	Absolutely, we definitely try to get
7083000	7085000	girls from all over the tri-state area
7085000	7087000	to kind of just get together,
7087000	7089000	to meet other girls, to find other venues
7089000	7091000	and genres that they play with,
7091000	7093000	and just to have an atmosphere and a community
7093000	7095000	that they feel pretty proud and comfortable
7095000	7097000	in. Our
7097000	7099000	number one passion and mission
7099000	7101000	is to just provide
7101000	7103000	a wonderful atmosphere for girl gamers
7103000	7105000	and empower and inspire them actually,
7105000	7107000	because ultimately, we
7107000	7109000	girls need that community,
7109000	7111000	we need to find
7111000	7113000	other girls who play games
7113000	7115000	and just play.
7115000	7117000	That sounds pretty cool, so what
7117000	7119000	made you come up with this whole idea?
7119000	7121000	To be honest, I've
7121000	7123000	been gaming ever since I was like five.
7123000	7125000	I remember having an
7125000	7127000	NES and just playing it,
7127000	7129000	and it was actually taken away from me by my uncle,
7129000	7131000	but I was really
7131000	7133000	a hardcore Sega fan. I'm a hardcore
7133000	7135000	Sega fan, up until the Dreamcast when it
7135000	7137000	actually kind of just fell off the face of the earth.
7137000	7139000	I mean, now they're more of a software company,
7139000	7141000	but I always realized and remembered
7141000	7143000	feeling that I never
7143000	7145000	had a girl that I could always play with.
7145000	7147000	I went to an all-girls school, up into
7147000	7149000	high school, and I never
7149000	7151000	had the companionship, and
7151000	7153000	I saw that the world lacked that,
7153000	7155000	a place where you could find that companionship.
7155000	7157000	It's like, yeah, you can go to forums,
7157000	7159000	but there isn't a specific venue that you can
7159000	7161000	kind of just find a girl
7161000	7163000	that is looking for a Guild Wars 2
7163000	7165000	Guild mate, or
7165000	7167000	even if it's just Call of Duty.
7167000	7169000	That sounds pretty cool.
7169000	7171000	So what makes Girl Game Evolved
7171000	7173000	different from other female
7173000	7175000	gamer clans like the D20 girls
7175000	7177000	or something like that?
7177000	7179000	It makes it kind of different.
7179000	7181000	Well, we're not a clan, per se.
7181000	7183000	We're a means to an end,
7183000	7185000	if anything. If you're looking for a clan,
7185000	7187000	if you're looking for a friend,
7187000	7189000	we're the place that you would go to
7189000	7191000	in order to find that clan.
7191000	7193000	So you're pretty much like the liaison
7193000	7195000	to connect other gaming girls
7195000	7197000	to other groups and
7197000	7199000	clans and teams and so forth.
7199000	7201000	Okay. I mean, the
7201000	7203000	website is pretty much kind of like a
7203000	7205000	magazine. We do previews and reviews of
7205000	7207000	games. We do video games psychology, so we
7207000	7209000	teach girls about other
7209000	7211000	types of genre games, so if you're not
7211000	7213000	familiar with First Person Shooter, we
7213000	7215000	kind of talk about that. We also
7215000	7217000	do kind of like
7217000	7219000	101 gaming for moms,
7219000	7221000	so if you're a mom out there and your child
7221000	7223000	is a son or a daughter who's really into
7223000	7225000	games, we teach you about the ESRB
7225000	7227000	rating. We teach you about what games are
7227000	7229000	good for your child. We also talk
7229000	7231000	about games you can play as
7231000	7233000	a mom who's not very familiar with games as well.
7233000	7235000	That sounds pretty
7235000	7237000	cool. So how long have you
7237000	7239000	been running this organization?
7239000	7241000	Officially, it's been running since
7241000	7243000	November 2011, but
7243000	7245000	it's always been a dream and a passion ever since
7245000	7247000	I can remember.
7247000	7249000	So where do you see this
7249000	7251000	site going? What's your vision
7251000	7253000	for it?
7253000	7255000	To be honest with anything,
7255000	7257000	I don't have any expectations
7257000	7259000	when it comes to this. It's kind of just like
7259000	7261000	I want to do more.
7261000	7263000	We definitely want to be able to just
7263000	7265000	bring more women and more girls and
7265000	7267000	more gamers into this community because
7267000	7269000	we want to become
7269000	7271000	a positive
7271000	7273000	representation of the gaming community
7273000	7275000	because in actuality, that's
7275000	7277000	how the gaming community started. It started
7277000	7279000	out with gamers
7279000	7281000	very passionate about their hobbies
7281000	7283000	and promoting it.
7283000	7285000	Right now, I'm not
7285000	7287000	going to say it's unbalanced, but I feel like there's
7287000	7289000	not a lot of representations for females.
7289000	7291000	There's not a lot of places that they can go
7291000	7293000	to to either A.
7293000	7295000	get the kind of news feeds they want
7295000	7297000	or B. get the kind of
7297000	7299000	information they need.
7299000	7301000	We talk about video game fashion and
7301000	7303000	we talk about this is actually
7303000	7305000	a Legend of Zelda
7305000	7307000	Fire from Ocarina of Time.
7307000	7309000	It's a jewel, but it's been made out of a necklace.
7309000	7311000	We showcase things like that because
7311000	7313000	they're important.
7313000	7315000	Particularly a girl, if she wanted to
7315000	7317000	buy that, she could be able to
7317000	7319000	find it on our website.
7319000	7321000	That's pretty cool. I like that
7321000	7323000	concept. I just like
7323000	7325000	the idea of it and what
7325000	7327000	you're working with and
7327000	7329000	where it's going so far.
7329000	7331000	Outside of this, what kind of games
7331000	7333000	do you like to play?
7333000	7335000	Right now,
7335000	7337000	I'm playing Guild Wars 2
7337000	7339000	and I love Guild Wars 2 because
7339000	7341000	I played Aeon and World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy
7341000	7343000	and I played LOL.
7343000	7345000	It's just
7345000	7347000	I love, I don't like
7347000	7349000	the I hit you, you
7349000	7351000	hit me kind of gaming.
7351000	7353000	I actually write for Game Tire and I wrote
7353000	7355000	an article about the top 15 qualities
7355000	7357000	for an MMORPG
7357000	7359000	and Guild Wars 2
7359000	7361000	just seems to be nailing 85
7361000	7363000	to 90% of anything that I was
7363000	7365000	asking for an MMORPG.
7365000	7367000	Granted, it's not like WoW.
7367000	7369000	WoW will always, I mean like the
7369000	7371000	end game is just
7371000	7373000	like the end game like Instance and Raids
7373000	7375000	and World of Warcraft.
7375000	7377000	You can't get that in Guild Wars 2 but
7377000	7379000	Guild Wars 2 has just so much
7379000	7381000	more opportunities for you to explore.
7381000	7383000	You get
7383000	7385000	points and you get rewarding experiences
7385000	7387000	for helping out and I feel like
7387000	7389000	Guild Wars 2 actually has this social aspect.
7389000	7391000	I play
7391000	7393000	mostly PS3 and PS2 and PS1
7393000	7395000	games, I ain't no Sony fan, but
7395000	7397000	I'm completely a diehard Sega fan.
7397000	7399000	I still have my Sega Dreamcast, I still have my Gensys.
7399000	7401000	I didn't get a Saturn but I do
7401000	7403000	have a Game Gear.
7403000	7405000	But do you also have a Master System?
7405000	7407000	I don't have a Master System.
7407000	7409000	We might have to get her a Master System.
7409000	7411000	I would love a Master System.
7411000	7413000	I might know someone may have a spare but I'll have to double
7413000	7415000	check with that. It's not that
7415000	7417000	I didn't have it because I didn't want it.
7417000	7419000	I didn't have it because of funs reasons.
7419000	7421000	It's all good.
7421000	7423000	Now, while running World of Warcraft
7423000	7425000	have you ever reached any difficulties
7425000	7427000	or any guys going
7427000	7429000	what?
7429000	7431000	You know to be honest
7431000	7433000	yeah, but if I
7433000	7435000	stopped when I came
7435000	7437000	I wouldn't be where I am right now.
7437000	7439000	You really need to understand
7439000	7441000	that you will come across
7441000	7443000	people that want you to fail
7443000	7445000	but you got to understand that you're doing
7445000	7447000	something that's you.
7447000	7449000	You are a gamer. I'm a gamer.
7449000	7451000	I know I'm a gamer and I know what I'm doing
7451000	7453000	regardless of what anyone does makes me happy.
7453000	7455000	Well there you go.
7455000	7457000	I can't argue with that type of logic.
7457000	7459000	So, when we get out of here, do you have any last words
7459000	7461000	for any game girls out there who are like
7461000	7463000	well, I don't know.
7463000	7465000	You know
7465000	7467000	to be honest, you can
7467000	7469000	deny being a gamer all you want.
7469000	7471000	But the moment you
7471000	7473000	embrace it and be who you are
7473000	7475000	even if you play Farmville
7475000	7477000	even if you play a 3DS
7477000	7479000	you know, it doesn't
7479000	7481000	matter. If you're playing something
7481000	7483000	that is immersed
7483000	7485000	into a digital world
7485000	7487000	you're playing a game and you shouldn't
7487000	7489000	A. demote it
7489000	7491000	as not being a gamer and B.
7491000	7493000	you shouldn't diminish anybody else
7493000	7495000	that's following that.
7495000	7497000	The video game community is changing
7497000	7499000	to include everything from
7499000	7501000	science to medicine
7501000	7503000	to psychology
7503000	7505000	to even the industry booming in business.
7505000	7507000	I mean, even fashion is becoming a big
7507000	7509000	part of it and the moment
7509000	7511000	that you discriminate and divide
7511000	7513000	yourself, you're becoming a factor
7513000	7515000	in the divide in the gaming industry
7515000	7517000	that me and many other people
7517000	7519000	are fighting against.
7519000	7521000	Wow, those are some strong
7521000	7523000	powerful words.
7523000	7525000	Okay, so let me ask you
7525000	7527000	girl gamer
7527000	7529000	gamer girl
7529000	7531000	doesn't really matter.
7531000	7533000	It doesn't matter. What matters mostly
7533000	7535000	is that if you say you're a girl gamer
7535000	7537000	or a gamer girl and then you start posting
7537000	7539000	photos with you with like controllers
7539000	7541000	covering your boobs
7541000	7543000	you're giving
7543000	7545000	a terrible interpretation of what a
7545000	7547000	girl gamer is. That is
7547000	7549000	the line. If you are not
7549000	7551000	a girl gamer and you're out there and you're
7551000	7553000	promoting that you're a girl gamer and you're doing
7553000	7555000	very sensual, provocative
7555000	7557000	images and representation
7557000	7559000	you are hindering what we're working for.
7559000	7561000	I am fighting so hard
7561000	7563000	and many other women are fighting so hard
7563000	7565000	to give a positive representation
7565000	7567000	of girl gamers. And if you're
7567000	7569000	also directed to all you ladies that are out
7569000	7571000	there that are doing this, stop.
7571000	7573000	Because we're fighting
7573000	7575000	through the right type of gamers
7575000	7577000	and if you're hurting us
7577000	7579000	you're an obstacle. And to be
7579000	7581000	honest, we will try
7581000	7583000	everything possible to overrun it.
7583000	7585000	Because what you're doing is you're
7585000	7587000	defeating us and you're
7587000	7589000	contradicting what we're working so
7589000	7591000	hard for. There are people that are spending time
7591000	7593000	money and effort. There are women who are
7593000	7595000	spending so much time, money and effort. And if
7595000	7597000	you're out there, just please stop.
7597000	7599000	If you want to be sensual
7599000	7601000	if you want to be provocative, fine.
7601000	7603000	Do it without a controller. Do it without saying
7603000	7605000	that you're a girl gamer or a gamer girl.
7605000	7607000	Because you're putting us in a bad light.
7607000	7609000	And it's disrespectful
7609000	7611000	it's hurtful
7611000	7613000	and it's obnoxious.
7613000	7615000	Wow, like I said, those are some really
7615000	7617000	powerful words. So
7617000	7619000	for everyone that's out
7619000	7621000	there watching, listening, where can
7621000	7623000	you find more information about
7623000	7625000	Girl Gamer Vogue? Well, we're at
7625000	7627000	GG Vogue, like GG's in Gorilla.
7627000	7629000	GGVogue.com or Girl Gamer Vogue
7629000	7631000	you can find us on Facebook, on Twitter,
7631000	7633000	on Tumblr, on Instagram, on
7633000	7635000	Flickr. I forget
7635000	7637000	what other place we're associated with.
7637000	7639000	But by all means, we need more girls
7639000	7641000	who are just as passionate and prominent
7641000	7643000	that are looking for a place to call home.
7643000	7645000	Most of the people, if not
7645000	7647000	all, probably like 99%,
7647000	7649000	they are very comfortable people. You want to
7649000	7651000	talk about games by all means. We're
7651000	7653000	associated with a bunch of other communities
7653000	7655000	as well. And if you want to play
7655000	7657000	Call of Duty, Guild Wars,
7657000	7659000	you know, whatever it is, we'll find you a place to
7659000	7661000	find people, to find girls
7661000	7663000	that you can be best friends with. And that's
7663000	7665000	what we only want to be. We want to be good friends with you.
7665000	7667000	Wow, that's pretty good.
7667000	7669000	Well, Jen, thank you for your time. Thank you for having
7669000	7671000	me. Thanks for coming.
7671000	7673000	No problem. At least we can do.
7673000	7675000	Whatever we can do for you, we're here for you.
7675000	7677000	DJ Rama S, signing off.
7681000	7683000	Welcome back, everybody, to
7683000	7685000	Orange Lounge Radio.
7685000	7687000	And thank you, DJ Rama S, for that
7687000	7689000	interview. And especially
7689000	7691000	Jen from Girl Gamer
7691000	7693000	Vogue. I like her.
7693000	7695000	She's really trying to do a good thing for the
7695000	7697000	community. I like when she was talking about
7697000	7699000	educating people about the ESRB
7699000	7701000	system. And I really think
7701000	7703000	and I hope everybody's listening to her when she talks
7703000	7705000	about how, you know,
7705000	7707000	our community is
7707000	7709000	kind of growing and really embraced
7709000	7711000	that, you know, you've got all these different types
7711000	7713000	of casual gamers and gaming is something
7713000	7715000	they do in all these different industries and so forth.
7715000	7717000	So, yeah.
7717000	7719000	Thanks to
7719000	7721000	Rama for getting that interview for us.
7721000	7723000	And thanks to Jen for being on the show,
7723000	7725000	even though maybe she didn't know she was going to be on Orange Lounge Radio
7725000	7727000	when she first did that interview.
7727000	7729000	So, a big thank you all around.
7729000	7731000	And I want to get
7731000	7733000	our listeners thinking about this.
7733000	7735000	Because I really liked what just
7735000	7737000	happened there. I like that a listener
7737000	7739000	kind of contributed that
7739000	7741000	particular segment. And it gave us
7741000	7743000	something to play on the show that
7743000	7745000	we could actually put on the podcast
7745000	7747000	that was interesting to listen to.
7747000	7749000	And it was, you know, something a little different and the listener
7749000	7751000	created. So, we
7751000	7753000	want to try, come December
7753000	7755000	or so forth, we would like to try
7755000	7757000	opening up our breaks
7757000	7759000	to listener created content.
7759000	7761000	Now, that particular
7761000	7763000	piece was a little bit long.
7763000	7765000	But we're talking, think about something maybe
7765000	7767000	a minute and a half to two minutes long.
7767000	7769000	Maybe a news update
7769000	7771000	on a particular game or series that you enjoy.
7771000	7773000	Or, you know, maybe
7773000	7775000	some community updates for a particular
7775000	7777000	community that you're a fan of.
7777000	7779000	Or something along those lines.
7779000	7781000	We're not going to start playing those next week.
7781000	7783000	But it's something we're looking at for December.
7783000	7785000	Something where the users create content.
7785000	7787000	Now, I do want to be clear on a few
7787000	7789000	things.
7789000	7791000	You won't be able to actually represent
7791000	7793000	OLR and go get
7793000	7795000	interviews and say, oh, my interview is going to be
7795000	7797000	on OLR. No, no, that's
7797000	7799000	for myself, Dark Soccer, and Loki to do.
7799000	7801000	But, you know, talk to us
7801000	7803000	if you have some ideas along those lines.
7803000	7805000	We'll see what we can arrange. We just, you know, if
7805000	7807000	you're going to represent OLR, we have to make sure that you're
7807000	7809000	not going to do something that could
7809000	7811000	anger a potential guest or what have you.
7811000	7813000	So, just be thinking about that.
7813000	7815000	We'll give you more details in the coming weeks.
7815000	7817000	But that's something we're hoping
7817000	7819000	to do on the show is institute
7819000	7821000	user-created content
7821000	7823000	in our breaks. So, awesome.
7823000	7825000	And remember, I am
7825000	7827000	Omega.
7827000	7829000	Damn, apparently
7829000	7831000	the live listeners lost the feed for a moment
7831000	7833000	while I was making that pitch. But once again,
7833000	7835000	we're looking at doing listener-created content
7835000	7837000	during the breaks instead of music in little
7837000	7839000	two-minute chunks or less
7839000	7841000	for, you know, whatever community it is
7841000	7843000	that you're passionate about. After all,
7843000	7845000	it's the show where every gamer has a
7845000	7847000	voice, and I think we've been neglecting
7847000	7849000	one big way to get
7849000	7851000	your voices on the show. Yeah,
7851000	7853000	OLR reporters, OLR freelancers.
7853000	7855000	I'm loving those terms in chat. Perfect.
7855000	7857000	So, more information to come in the
7857000	7859000	coming weeks. That's something we want to implement in
7859000	7861000	January, or excuse me, December.
7861000	7863000	Meanwhile, let's
7863000	7865000	get back into some rapid-fire
7865000	7867000	news. Loki, start us off.
7867000	7869000	Alright. So, let's see.
7869000	7871000	Let's talk a little bit about Black Ops
7871000	7873000	2 since that's going to be coming out this week.
7873000	7875000	One of the things that they just recently announced
7875000	7877000	before they had the whole
7877000	7879000	streaming that you can do of your gameplay
7879000	7881000	with the League play and stuff like that.
7881000	7883000	Well, now it's been confirmed that
7883000	7885000	that's going to be linked in with
7885000	7887000	YouTube live streaming. So, you're going to
7887000	7889000	build a live stream on Xbox
7889000	7891000	360, PlayStation 3, and
7891000	7893000	on the PC version as well.
7893000	7895000	No word on the Wii U yet because
7895000	7897000	a lot of the integration that they have with Elite and stuff
7897000	7899000	like that on the Wii U doesn't quite work.
7899000	7901000	But, it's pretty cool. Also, I guess
7901000	7903000	you're going to be able to see the player's gamer card
7903000	7905000	of whoever you're streaming and some other
7905000	7907000	additional information like class loadouts
7907000	7909000	and stats and stuff like that.
7909000	7911000	It's pretty cool. I actually did spot
7911000	7913000	some of this stuff when I was doing the
7913000	7915000	local play stuff.
7915000	7917000	They had some options for that, but
7917000	7919000	really neat that you'll be able to live stream games.
7919000	7921000	I kind of wish they had that for Grand Theft Auto, but
7921000	7923000	that's still a ways away.
7923000	7925000	Neat.
7925000	7927000	It's a neat idea. I know live streaming
7927000	7929000	is pretty popular nowadays.
7931000	7933000	I think that's a neat thing to build into the game, too.
7933000	7935000	Yeah,
7935000	7937000	I'm curious what this is going to bring.
7937000	7939000	It's neat. Well, it's cool, too,
7939000	7941000	because a lot of people don't have the hardware
7941000	7943000	to kind of video capture everything that they're doing,
7943000	7945000	so this is kind of built into the game, which
7945000	7947000	I think is pretty cool. Well, it's fascinating how the
7947000	7949000	industry is really embracing it, too. I would have
7949000	7951000	assumed there was going to be resistance to it,
7951000	7953000	especially, you know, we talked about the Microsoft policy
7953000	7955000	and all that stuff some time ago,
7955000	7957000	which is kind of this strange in the middle
7957000	7959000	place, but it is very interesting
7959000	7961000	how, you know, instead of
7961000	7963000	the game companies going to
7963000	7965000	try and shut down places like Twitch TV
7965000	7967000	and the other streaming sites, they're really saying,
7967000	7969000	alright, this is something people want to do.
7969000	7971000	It's promotion for our game. Let's do it.
7971000	7973000	Yeah. Now, here's a weird
7973000	7975000	promotion. They're doing something with Halo 4
7975000	7977000	and their multiplayer, where
7977000	7979000	they're actually allowing players to
7979000	7981000	get Microsoft
7981000	7983000	points for playing multiplayer,
7983000	7985000	and here's how it works. Okay, so
7985000	7987000	basically, if you get Halo 4
7987000	7989000	and you play 35
7989000	7991000	hours plus, and this is between
7991000	7993000	launch until the end of this month,
7993000	7995000	so November 30th is a cutoff for it,
7995000	7997000	but if you play over 35
7997000	7999000	hours, you're going to get 100 Microsoft
7999000	8001000	points. If you...
8001000	8003000	Whoopee! I know. Whoopee shit.
8003000	8005000	Ooh, a dollar and like
8005000	8007000	20 cents or something. Okay, so then
8007000	8009000	if you play
8009000	8011000	$1.25, that's what it was,
8011000	8013000	70 hours,
8013000	8015000	guess what?
8015000	8017000	You're going to double that.
8017000	8019000	Or, I'm sorry, you're going to triple that. You're going to get
8019000	8021000	300 Microsoft points.
8021000	8023000	Yay, a denomination that
8023000	8025000	totally doesn't round out anything.
8025000	8027000	So, you're going to have
8027000	8029000	300 Microsoft points possible
8029000	8031000	there for you guys.
8031000	8033000	Also, if you happen to play over
8033000	8035000	140 hours...
8035000	8037000	Was this only online multiplayer?
8037000	8039000	This is only online multiplayer.
8039000	8041000	Halo 4 multiplayer... Matchmaking
8041000	8043000	or customer, does it say? It's multiplayer
8043000	8045000	over Xbox Live. So,
8045000	8047000	I could make a custom match,
8047000	8049000	set the timer to unlimited,
8049000	8051000	have it run all day,
8051000	8053000	have me and my friends set up a custom match
8053000	8055000	have the timer run all day, and I could do that, right?
8055000	8057000	If I wanted to be...
8057000	8059000	I don't know if they'd let you do that.
8059000	8061000	I mean, it would be a big waste of time,
8061000	8063000	but I guess I suppose you could do that.
8063000	8065000	Also,
8065000	8067000	I guess they're also doing...
8067000	8069000	It's going to be up to 800 Microsoft points.
8069000	8071000	So, I'm kind of confused to where they're going to get this
8071000	8073000	800 Microsoft points, I guess.
8073000	8075000	Oh, I'm sorry, the extra
8075000	8077000	200 is coming from spending
8077000	8079000	at least 3,000 Microsoft points on the
8079000	8081000	Halo Marketplace content.
8081000	8083000	Woohoo,
8083000	8085000	200 points back after spending...
8085000	8087000	So, it's like a dinky two-buck rebate.
8087000	8089000	Yeah, 3,000 Microsoft
8089000	8091000	points, which is the
8091000	8093000	equivalent of almost...
8093000	8095000	What is that?
8095000	8097000	40 bucks?
8097000	8099000	Almost?
8099000	8101000	I don't know.
8101000	8103000	All the point values are just...
8103000	8105000	It's annoying.
8105000	8107000	So, yeah, there you have it.
8107000	8109000	Some money back if you do that.
8109000	8111000	Oh, and I guess also if you...
8111000	8113000	If you spend,
8113000	8115000	I guess, 1,500 Microsoft points,
8115000	8117000	you get 100 Microsoft points back.
8118000	8120000	Fantastic, I guess.
8120000	8122000	But it is kind of neat, though, to see
8122000	8124000	that you can earn some Microsoft points
8124000	8126000	for playing a game for a long period of time.
8126000	8128000	YYR says it's more like a thank you
8128000	8130000	to the people who are going to do it anyway.
8130000	8132000	I think it's just trying to get people to play
8132000	8134000	a long time so that they can try to beat up
8134000	8136000	Black Ops 2, which is probably going to dominate
8136000	8138000	multiplayer, and they want
8138000	8140000	to have it look nice when
8140000	8142000	Halo 4 is at the top of the charts there, but
8142000	8144000	it's going to be tough.
8144000	8146000	And last but not least,
8146000	8148000	there's been a lot of information
8148000	8150000	regarding Grand Theft Auto 5 coming out.
8150000	8152000	All of this coming from the brand new issue
8152000	8154000	of Game Informer.
8154000	8156000	And a lot of details
8156000	8158000	regarding kind of the single player
8158000	8160000	campaign, including,
8160000	8162000	you know,
8162000	8164000	first off, the game's
8164000	8166000	map itself is going to be
8166000	8168000	over... It's going to be bigger
8168000	8170000	than Grand Theft Auto 4, San Andreas,
8170000	8172000	and Red Dead Redemption combined.
8172000	8174000	It's just the
8174000	8176000	largest map in any of the games
8176000	8178000	at all.
8178000	8180000	So, that's fantastic.
8180000	8182000	There's going to be three
8182000	8184000	different people that you get to play as.
8184000	8186000	Three different protagonists, including
8186000	8188000	let's see here,
8188000	8190000	I'm trying to remember the names of these guys.
8192000	8194000	I don't remember.
8194000	8196000	Well, anyways, that's not important.
8196000	8198000	But three different people you get to play as.
8198000	8200000	Also, they're going to have some different
8200000	8202000	locations available in the game.
8202000	8204000	Some of the stuff, obviously, you've seen in the
8204000	8206000	trailers, including
8208000	8210000	stuff based off of the
8210000	8212000	vineyard areas.
8212000	8214000	Obviously, Rockford Hills,
8214000	8216000	which is like Beverly Hills.
8216000	8218000	Blaine County, which is kind of like this
8218000	8220000	desert. They say they have bikers
8220000	8222000	and meth heads in there.
8222000	8224000	Oh, goodie! Vespucci Beach,
8224000	8226000	which is similar, I guess, to Venice Beach.
8226000	8228000	Also, some beach fronts
8228000	8230000	and stuff like that. They're saying also
8230000	8232000	the game's going to have
8232000	8234000	a Salton Sea region, a military base,
8234000	8236000	suburban hills.
8236000	8238000	There's a Mount Chiliad,
8238000	8240000	I guess, which is
8240000	8242000	a large wilderness area where you can
8242000	8244000	explore all that. They're also going to have
8244000	8246000	underwater areas that you can
8246000	8248000	scuba dive in and stuff like that.
8248000	8250000	They've got this
8250000	8252000	brand new engine that has
8252000	8254000	multi-mile draw distances
8254000	8256000	in there. I guess also, you're
8256000	8258000	going to be able to do all sorts of things
8258000	8260000	from, they have a golf course that you can play
8260000	8262000	a full round of golf in, if you really want to.
8262000	8264000	Wow.
8264000	8266000	All sorts of details.
8266000	8268000	As long as I can beat people with my clubs.
8268000	8270000	They have
8270000	8272000	bowling, strip clubs,
8272000	8274000	stand-up comedy acts, TV shows,
8274000	8276000	internet cafes, kind of all similar to
8276000	8278000	what they had before.
8278000	8280000	You can also, I guess,
8280000	8282000	go to the gym. You can attend a sermon.
8282000	8284000	They've got yoga, triathlons
8284000	8286000	that you can do, base jumping,
8286000	8288000	tennis, jet skiing.
8288000	8290000	Also, they're getting rid of
8290000	8292000	the romance stuff in there because
8292000	8294000	God was fucking annoying.
8294000	8296000	One of the things I thought was really cool about it, though, is
8296000	8298000	the three main characters,
8298000	8300000	when you're switching between them, they
8300000	8302000	go off on their own thing and do
8302000	8304000	whatever. They'll
8304000	8306000	go on their own business.
8306000	8308000	It zooms out of the map
8308000	8310000	like Google Earth, I guess, and then goes into
8310000	8312000	these different characters.
8312000	8314000	The three characters,
8314000	8316000	Michael, who I guess is
8316000	8318000	the guy who did the voiceover in the first trailer.
8318000	8320000	He's a retired bank robber, and
8320000	8322000	now he's kind of on the FIB,
8322000	8324000	the FBI
8324000	8326000	Witness Protection
8326000	8328000	Program.
8328000	8330000	He's
8330000	8332000	hiding out.
8332000	8334000	Also, there's a guy named Trevor,
8334000	8336000	who is this crazy meth
8336000	8338000	head, who
8338000	8340000	is this crazy
8340000	8342000	war veteran or whatever.
8342000	8344000	Franklin, who is a repo man.
8344000	8346000	It's kind of all them
8346000	8348000	coming together to
8348000	8350000	do these heists.
8350000	8352000	But,
8352000	8354000	lots of screenshots. Looks fantastic.
8354000	8356000	New trailer
8356000	8358000	is going to be coming out on the 14th this week.
8358000	8360000	Very excited
8360000	8362000	by that. This is definitely
8362000	8364000	a game I'm highly, highly
8364000	8366000	looking forward to. No fanboy involved.
8366000	8368000	No, no, not at all. It's the biggest game next year.
8368000	8370000	All right.
8370000	8372000	Some rapid fire news for me.
8372000	8374000	Gamefly's digital PC client
8374000	8376000	is now out. It was in beta for a while,
8376000	8378000	but it is now officially out.
8378000	8380000	You can download this if you're anybody.
8380000	8382000	You don't have to be a Gamefly subscriber to get it.
8382000	8384000	Anybody can have it. Over 1,500
8384000	8386000	Windows and Mac titles. This is sounding a little bit
8386000	8388000	like a commercial, but it's been around on the game
8388000	8390000	blogs. If you are
8390000	8392000	a member, you should be aware, because I know a lot
8392000	8394000	of you guys are. You can do the whole unlimited PC
8394000	8396000	play. It's pretty much GameTap.
8396000	8398000	In a way.
8398000	8400000	Except I don't think it's a lot of the classic games,
8400000	8402000	but more kind of like the games that are,
8402000	8404000	you know, they're not super old,
8404000	8406000	but they're old enough to not really be selling anymore.
8406000	8408000	Like, Saints Row 2 is
8408000	8410000	unlimited PC play. Right?
8410000	8412000	So, there you go.
8412000	8414000	Oh, apparently,
8414000	8416000	2K games giving
8416000	8418000	everybody who downloads the
8418000	8420000	client a free copy of Bioshock.
8420000	8422000	I don't know if that's still going, but it was going for a while.
8422000	8424000	It probably only was on the launch day. It's probably done now.
8424000	8426000	But still.
8426000	8428000	I could just play that on PS3.
8428000	8430000	That's true. Or, you know,
8430000	8432000	a lot of folks bought the collection on Steam
8432000	8434000	or what have you. Anyhow,
8434000	8436000	Xbox 360 USB data storage.
8436000	8438000	It was capped at 16 gigabytes.
8438000	8440000	I don't know if you know that for the USB storage.
8440000	8442000	They actually raised that.
8442000	8444000	In this recent update that happened, it wasn't
8444000	8446000	really out there, but it has been
8446000	8448000	increased to 32 gigabytes.
8448000	8450000	So, it has been
8450000	8452000	confirmed with Microsoft that this was
8452000	8454000	intentional. So, there
8454000	8456000	you go. That's great news for those folks
8456000	8458000	that need to make way for
8458000	8460000	data to install their Halo 4
8460000	8462000	They should just not have a cap.
8462000	8464000	Oh, I understand.
8464000	8466000	I understand they want to sell their overly expensive
8466000	8468000	hard drives for these systems,
8468000	8470000	but it shouldn't have a cap.
8470000	8472000	I mean, they're just selling these
8472000	8474000	laptop SATA drives
8474000	8476000	and charging a really
8476000	8478000	huge premium on that stuff when
8478000	8480000	I
8480000	8482000	understand you can use external drives to
8482000	8484000	supplement that, but only get 32 gigs of
8484000	8486000	pop, whereas you can get 2 terabyte
8486000	8488000	drive for half the price of like their
8488000	8490000	320 drive. So,
8490000	8492000	why even bother?
8492000	8494000	Well, in my last
8494000	8496000	story here for rapid fire news,
8496000	8498000	oh, you gotta love
8498000	8500000	porno inspired by video games.
8500000	8502000	Yes, Lollipop
8502000	8504000	Chainsaw is
8504000	8506000	inspiring a new porno in
8506000	8508000	Japan called Tia's Geek
8508000	8510000	Cosplay Fuck, and I
8510000	8512000	love that fuck is all in capital letters
8512000	8514000	with an exclamation point.
8514000	8516000	And she dresses up as some of the
8516000	8518000	various characters in Lollipop Chainsaw
8518000	8520000	including a giant chainsaw
8520000	8522000	and she cosplays
8522000	8524000	and presumably fucks.
8524000	8526000	Well, that is true.
8526000	8528000	It's all the same character,
8528000	8530000	it's just all of her alternate costumes from
8530000	8532000	the game, so if I remember
8532000	8534000	correctly,
8534000	8536000	and judging by the back picture
8536000	8538000	here, I don't think she dresses up
8538000	8540000	like anybody else. It's hard to tell because the
8540000	8542000	pictures are really small, but I do notice
8542000	8544000	that
8544000	8546000	it's definitely a lot of the alternate costumes.
8546000	8548000	Although, that one might be, no, no, no,
8548000	8550000	that's still...
8550000	8552000	Who cares? Naked chick dressing up.
8552000	8554000	Exactly. She's allowed to make some mistakes.
8554000	8556000	And she has a giant really weird looking chainsaw.
8556000	8558000	That has a heart at the end of it, but I guess that's
8558000	8560000	from the game.
8560000	8562000	So, there you go.
8562000	8564000	That chainsaw just looks really weird.
8564000	8566000	Cosplay Fuck!
8566000	8568000	Dark Sakura.
8568000	8570000	Try to follow that.
8570000	8572000	Well, I did get
8572000	8574000	Final Fuck 10 or X
8574000	8576000	or whatever.
8576000	8578000	Six mix.
8578000	8580000	Mental note. Ask Eddie about Dance Dance Fuck
8580000	8582000	next time he comes on the show.
8582000	8584000	Well,
8584000	8586000	a little girl named Maya
8586000	8588000	gets to play Legend of Zelda
8588000	8590000	The Wind Waker as a girl.
8590000	8592000	Basically,
8592000	8594000	her dad is developer Mike Hoy
8594000	8596000	who
8596000	8598000	basically hex-edited the game to
8598000	8600000	replace all of the dialogue to be feminine
8600000	8602000	in regards to Link's gender.
8602000	8604000	So, instead of
8604000	8606000	Swordman, it's Swordmane
8606000	8608000	and Milady instead of My Lad and Master.
8608000	8610000	And he's actually
8610000	8612000	put the disc image up that you can play.
8612000	8614000	And it's pretty
8614000	8616000	neat. I think that's nice.
8616000	8618000	So his daughter can have an adventure
8618000	8620000	that feels more believable
8620000	8622000	to a little girl. To be fair, he's not
8622000	8624000	actually putting up the disc image because that would be piracy,
8624000	8626000	but he's putting up the patch file that if you
8626000	8628000	find the disc image with a certain MD5
8628000	8630000	hash, you can patch it.
8630000	8632000	Lollipop Chainsaw stars a girl.
8632000	8634000	Just saying.
8634000	8636000	Yeah, and the game was also awful.
8636000	8638000	That game is almost porn only as it is.
8638000	8640000	It's pretty bad though, but it's just...
8640000	8642000	Yeah. How old will Josh have to be
8642000	8644000	before you let him play Lollipop Chainsaw?
8644000	8646000	I won't let him play it because it's really
8646000	8648000	terrible. I mean, it is a terrible
8648000	8650000	game. He doesn't get to play bad games.
8650000	8652000	Listen, if you're gonna waste your time on the game,
8652000	8654000	just go on the internet and watch porn because seriously
8654000	8656000	it's a better use of your time than playing this game.
8656000	8658000	I mean, this game is just
8658000	8660000	lame. Next story.
8660000	8662000	Yes. The Angry Video Game
8662000	8664000	Nerd. Now for anyone who's kept up with that Kickstarter,
8664000	8666000	you know, there was a Kickstarter to do
8666000	8668000	a movie, and there's a trailer up.
8668000	8670000	I watched it yesterday.
8670000	8672000	And I was like, really?
8672000	8674000	Ugh.
8674000	8676000	It looks like a bad 90s
8676000	8678000	comedy. I know, I'm gonna watch it just
8678000	8680000	for that. But, I don't know, there were some
8680000	8682000	parts that made me laugh, like the guy going,
8682000	8684000	Where the fuck is my arm?
8684000	8686000	Isn't that guy from something
8686000	8688000	because he looks like, he looks like,
8688000	8690000	was it the, um, the boss that they had
8690000	8692000	in one of the Mega Man games where he had like the,
8692000	8694000	you know, the tank body type thing?
8694000	8696000	I, maybe, I don't know.
8696000	8698000	Maybe he's supposed to be a really screwed
8698000	8700000	up American Dr. Wily. It looks cheesy
8700000	8702000	like that Gamers movie. Remember
8702000	8704000	there's a lot of people that thought that Gamers movie
8704000	8706000	was so awesome and then they made a sequel
8706000	8708000	to it for God knows what reason. It's probably
8708000	8710000	because they made a lot of money off of it.
8710000	8712000	But, yeah, it's,
8712000	8714000	whatever. It's supposed to be cheesy.
8714000	8716000	People buy it if, you know, or if it's
8716000	8718000	a Kickstarter, he's gonna make money from it.
8718000	8720000	Well, um, you know how before
8720000	8722000	we talked about Minecraft being used in schools?
8722000	8724000	Well, another game is being used in schools, and that's
8724000	8726000	Happy Action Theater. The big,
8726000	8728000	uh, double fine green screen
8728000	8730000	game, um, they're using it in
8730000	8732000	schools now to help kids with autism
8732000	8734000	since verbal language is difficult for
8734000	8736000	autistic kids, then, um,
8736000	8738000	they use it for different types of communication
8738000	8740000	and it's actually, they're getting some, uh,
8740000	8742000	significant results with it.
8742000	8744000	I think that's really cool. And
8744000	8746000	I'm dead.
8746000	8748000	Alright, let's get to the FUGL Question
8748000	8750000	of the Week.
8750000	8752000	It's right here.
8756000	8758000	Every week, we
8758000	8760000	ask a question on our fan communities on
8760000	8762000	Facebook and Google Plus.
8762000	8764000	Smoosh them together, you get FUGL.
8764000	8766000	So, uh, here it is.
8766000	8768000	Uh, in honor of the fact that we talked a lot about
8768000	8770000	music games tonight. Our show was
8770000	8772000	born of the music gaming community,
8772000	8774000	but we know we've picked up a variety of listeners
8774000	8776000	since our debut over ten years ago and
8776000	8778000	our shift to a general gaming show
8778000	8780000	several years ago. So what is your
8780000	8782000	current thoughts on music gaming?
8782000	8784000	Is that a genre of game you are into?
8784000	8786000	Do you think it was a fad that has faded with
8786000	8788000	the rise and fall of Guitar Hero in the States?
8788000	8790000	Or is the best yet to come?
8790000	8792000	Now, because our show is running a little long
8792000	8794000	tonight, I'm gonna keep this really short. I'm only
8794000	8796000	gonna read a few of these answers, but I really
8796000	8798000	encourage you guys to read the full responses
8798000	8800000	on our Google Plus community, Orange Lounge Radio,
8800000	8802000	and Facebook.com
8802000	8804000	slash Orange Lounge Radio. Uh, going
8804000	8806000	to Google Plus, I'm gonna read this one from
8806000	8808000	Redertainment. Like fashion music
8808000	8810000	and my exercise group, things run
8810000	8812000	in cycles. Music gaming will
8812000	8814000	have its comeback, then fizzle out,
8814000	8816000	then comeback, then fizzle out again.
8816000	8818000	However, ABBA is
8818000	8820000	forever. Preach.
8820000	8822000	Of course you like that one. Preach.
8822000	8824000	Of course I read that one.
8824000	8826000	How to get Rob to read your comment.
8826000	8828000	Uh, Nick M. replies
8828000	8830000	and said, Music is a way for us to all
8830000	8832000	express ourselves and tap
8832000	8834000	into those feel-good emotions.
8834000	8836000	So it really meshes with about any form
8836000	8838000	of entertainment. For this reason,
8838000	8840000	I believe the music genre
8840000	8842000	will continue to grow with gaming.
8842000	8844000	It will never die. Technology
8844000	8846000	innovations and creativity will allow
8846000	8848000	music-driven games to make a huge revival
8848000	8850000	leaving the best to come.
8850000	8852000	Those are some answers from our Google Plus
8852000	8854000	community. Let's do a couple from Facebook
8854000	8856000	over at Facebook.com
8856000	8858000	slash Orange Lounge Radio.
8858000	8860000	Uh, Matt J. replied and said,
8860000	8862000	I love music gaming still.
8862000	8864000	My rock band library has grown to
8864000	8866000	over 1700 songs and I'm playing
8866000	8868000	almost every day that I can
8868000	8870000	with a close group of friends. It's been
8870000	8872000	sad to see people leave the community, but I'm
8872000	8874000	still able to find new people I haven't played with.
8874000	8876000	While my enthusiasm has
8876000	8878000	died down significantly over the years,
8878000	8880000	I'm still very much involved because of the
8880000	8882000	social aspect, even online. There's
8882000	8884000	such a wonderful, but small, group of people
8884000	8886000	playing and it's such an enjoyable experience
8886000	8888000	to play along to old-time favorites
8888000	8890000	with friends or even to discover
8890000	8892000	new music.
8892000	8894000	Um, going on to some more
8894000	8896000	answers here. Oh, I want to hear from
8896000	8898000	this guy here, DJ Melvis.
8898000	8900000	Yay!
8900000	8902000	The popularity of music gaming now
8902000	8904000	compared to 10 years ago is really
8904000	8906000	night and day, or is nearly night and day.
8906000	8908000	What propelled the music gaming crowd then
8908000	8910000	was the gamer community, who propelled
8910000	8912000	it from a cult following to something
8912000	8914000	mainstream. Competitive tournaments,
8914000	8916000	video footage of said tourneys, it was
8916000	8918000	something people looked forward to and buzzed about.
8918000	8920000	Konami, in America,
8920000	8922000	failed to capitalize on that momentum and
8922000	8924000	assumed the fans would eat up anything they put out.
8924000	8926000	Instead of working with and cultivating
8926000	8928000	their fanbase, they turned a blind eye to them.
8928000	8930000	That ultimately killed a majority
8930000	8932000	of their following. Combine that with the demise
8932000	8934000	of arcade gaming in America, the tournament
8934000	8936000	scene died and the community grew further
8936000	8938000	apart. Rockband is pretty much
8938000	8940000	music gaming's last stand.
8940000	8942000	At least they nailed the whole microtransaction
8942000	8944000	process with DLC, and events
8944000	8946000	like UmLoud validate its popularity.
8946000	8948000	Go harmonics!
8948000	8950000	Good plug for UmLoud, by the way,
8950000	8952000	which is coming up real soon.
8952000	8954000	Tell me about it.
8954000	8956000	Um,
8956000	8958000	let's see, I'll do one more here from
8958000	8960000	Facebook. Again, I'm really sorry I'm limiting this
8960000	8962000	tonight, but we're just running long night.
8962000	8964000	Chiggers replies and says,
8976000	8978000	I've been saying the same thing.
8978000	8980000	I wonder, too, if they could do something like
8980000	8982000	trumpet smith or sitar smith.
8982000	8984000	I do think they need to somehow incorporate
8984000	8986000	music theory into some of the games, though, too.
8986000	8988000	Sure, it's fun to play some of your favorite
8988000	8990000	songs by memory, but you can't pick up the guitar
8990000	8992000	and read music and play something that's not on
8992000	8994000	the game. For the record, there has been
8994000	8996000	Sitar Hero. That was
8996000	8998000	a joke, though, right? That was on
8998000	9000000	the Austin Powers 3
9000000	9002000	website as a Flash game.
9002000	9004000	But it did exist.
9004000	9006000	Very interesting. Alright, so. Was it Austin Powers
9006000	9008000	3 or was it the, uh,
9008000	9010000	the Love Guru? It was the Love Guru,
9010000	9012000	that was right, yeah.
9012000	9014000	Everybody forgot about that game.
9014000	9016000	Everybody should forget about that movie.
9016000	9018000	So, there you go.
9018000	9020000	Quickly, I'll go around the room.
9020000	9022000	What's your current thoughts on music gaming?
9022000	9024000	I think it'll always
9024000	9026000	have a niche. We have to remember it didn't really
9026000	9028000	start with DDR or Beatmania.
9028000	9030000	It was dance aerobics.
9030000	9032000	But, you know, I think games,
9032000	9034000	especially in America, games like Parappa
9034000	9036000	the Rappa, and
9036000	9038000	I know I loved Bust a Move
9038000	9040000	or Bust a Groove or whatever they called it over here.
9040000	9042000	We need to totally break that out.
9042000	9044000	What? Oh, I know, but it was a great game.
9044000	9046000	So, I mean, I kind of
9046000	9048000	feel like there were games before, and there will still be
9048000	9050000	games in the future. I think
9050000	9052000	it, kind of like that originally, that first
9052000	9054000	comment I read where, like, it comes, it goes, it comes,
9054000	9056000	it goes. I think, um,
9056000	9058000	that's kind of how I feel. Loki, Dark Saga?
9058000	9060000	Now the Facts of Life theme is stuck in my head.
9060000	9062000	You take the good, you take the bad.
9062000	9064000	No.
9064000	9066000	Um, I
9066000	9068000	love music games, so I don't
9068000	9070000	really, I think it's gonna just
9070000	9072000	kind of, right now, coast along with
9072000	9074000	a lot of the dancing franchises with
9074000	9076000	Just Dance and Dance Central and that kind of stuff.
9076000	9078000	Um,
9078000	9080000	maybe with the new systems they'll find new
9080000	9082000	ways to kind of incorporate
9082000	9084000	whatever type of peripherals
9084000	9086000	that they have into it, like, you know, with
9086000	9088000	the Wii U tablet or something like that.
9088000	9090000	Um, I
9090000	9092000	just, you know, I hope it doesn't, I
9092000	9094000	assume it's just gonna keep, you know, staying around
9094000	9096000	for a while, because you still have, you know, a niche
9096000	9098000	audience that's really into it, and
9098000	9100000	sometimes that's all it takes is just a niche
9100000	9102000	audience, because, I mean, look at a lot of the Atlas
9102000	9104000	products and stuff like that that don't sell millions
9104000	9106000	of copies, and you have
9106000	9108000	dozens and dozens of sequels.
9110000	9112000	Alright, let's move on with some more
9112000	9114000	news, and then we'll get to the mailbag and
9114000	9116000	some quick calls tonight. So,
9116000	9118000	uh, Loki. Alright.
9118000	9120000	So, let's talk a little bit about
9120000	9122000	some really weird
9122000	9124000	patents, and
9124000	9126000	Microsoft has one now
9126000	9128000	that, it's basically this kind of
9128000	9130000	DRM system that's gonna use
9130000	9132000	a Kinect-like camera
9132000	9134000	to basically monitor
9134000	9136000	the number of users that are watching
9136000	9138000	a display of a certain performance
9138000	9140000	or content or whatever,
9140000	9142000	and, um,
9142000	9144000	basically, you know,
9144000	9146000	tracking the faces of those
9146000	9148000	viewers to see if they have appropriately
9148000	9150000	licensed it. So, for example,
9150000	9152000	I mean, it
9152000	9154000	sounds kind of stupid, but, like, let's say
9154000	9156000	I rented a movie or something like that,
9156000	9158000	and then I have to go to the bathroom
9158000	9160000	and I leave, that the movie would
9160000	9162000	stop or something because I'm no
9162000	9164000	longer in the room, and it's like, oh, shit, the person
9164000	9166000	that, you know,
9166000	9168000	registered this content is no longer in the
9168000	9170000	room. I mean, that sounds a little ridiculous,
9170000	9172000	but,
9172000	9174000	I mean, I don't know if this is
9174000	9176000	necessarily gonna be something that they do.
9176000	9178000	Um, you know,
9178000	9180000	mentions, I guess, gaming and gaming
9180000	9182000	media, also mobile devices.
9182000	9184000	Maybe my thought is that
9184000	9186000	it's like, you know, your computer
9186000	9188000	will lock, I mean, they have it right
9188000	9190000	now already with, like, some of those
9190000	9192000	biometric sensors and
9192000	9194000	stuff, but maybe it's something where your computer
9194000	9196000	will lock down if, like,
9196000	9198000	you know, it doesn't recognize you. Although
9198000	9200000	that's gonna suck if you get in a car accident and your face
9200000	9202000	gets defigured, but, you know,
9202000	9204000	I don't know. Or, you know, um, I know
9204000	9206000	a lot of the live listeners are complaining that the
9206000	9208000	OLR feed is going up, what did they say?
9208000	9210000	Uh, Raginator said, OLR is going
9210000	9212000	down faster and more frequently than
9212000	9214000	White House interns when Clinton was in office.
9214000	9216000	Well, you know, I like to,
9216000	9218000	uh, grow and shave a beard
9218000	9220000	pretty frequently as well.
9220000	9222000	I like having a beard,
9222000	9224000	but then I'll shave it when I have to do Rocky
9224000	9226000	or something, an onstage part that requires me to
9226000	9228000	shave it. So, you know,
9228000	9230000	how's that gonna pick that up?
9230000	9232000	I'm gonna put it this way. It's not that sophisticated.
9232000	9234000	It's basically looking at
9234000	9236000	facial geometry, like, you know,
9236000	9238000	the proportions between, you know, space
9238000	9240000	between your eyes. So the, you know, bone
9240000	9242000	structure and that kind of stuff. It's like, okay,
9242000	9244000	your face is this wide, your eyes are this far
9244000	9246000	apart. Yeah, but that technology's not gonna work.
9246000	9248000	That's the problem. The, you know,
9248000	9250000	the Kinect was supposed to do all this stuff
9250000	9252000	and it doesn't really work in
9252000	9254000	the real world. And who really likes signing
9254000	9256000	into Xbox Live
9256000	9258000	by staring at the Kinect for
9258000	9260000	like 30 seconds?
9260000	9262000	Or hitting A and signing
9262000	9264000	in, like, you know, right away?
9264000	9266000	I really hope this technology is only
9266000	9268000	being patented to harness it
9268000	9270000	so that nobody can ever use it.
9270000	9272000	That is my real true hope.
9272000	9274000	But I'm not gonna hold my breath.
9276000	9278000	We'll see.
9278000	9280000	We had news earlier in the year that
9280000	9282000	Nintendo Power was gonna be having its last
9282000	9284000	issue ever. And, uh,
9284000	9286000	guess what? PlayStation,
9286000	9288000	the official magazine, following right behind.
9288000	9290000	The holiday 2012
9290000	9292000	issue will be the last issue of the official,
9292000	9294000	or, excuse me, PlayStation, the
9294000	9296000	official magazine.
9296000	9298000	That is not long after Future
9298000	9300000	US, who also published Nintendo Power,
9300000	9302000	announced that shutdown.
9302000	9304000	So, uh, bye-bye.
9304000	9306000	Magazine's
9306000	9308000	going bye-bye. There's two.
9308000	9310000	Out the door.
9310000	9312000	It's unfortunate we don't have, like,
9312000	9314000	an iPad version
9314000	9316000	of it or something that lives on. I don't know.
9316000	9318000	Maybe. It makes me very
9318000	9320000	depressed because print is beautiful.
9320000	9322000	And ink smells good.
9322000	9324000	I know, but, well, what do you think
9324000	9326000	can be done to save this dying industry?
9326000	9328000	We still have Play, don't we?
9328000	9330000	I think so. I love that magazine.
9330000	9332000	Play better not go anywhere.
9332000	9334000	But, uh, what would, I mean,
9334000	9336000	do you think this is
9336000	9338000	something that could
9338000	9340000	make a renaissance someday, where we get,
9340000	9342000	or is this done because of technology?
9342000	9344000	Well, we got EGM again, right?
9344000	9346000	Is this just done because of tablets?
9346000	9348000	I know you don't like to think about it, but...
9348000	9350000	It's a shift.
9350000	9352000	Somebody's gotta design the tablet document
9352000	9354000	if we go there. It really is. The nature
9354000	9356000	of media is really
9356000	9358000	turning digital, which is good and bad.
9358000	9360000	I mean, I can
9360000	9362000	produce digital content.
9362000	9364000	The method's the same way.
9364000	9366000	I'm more worried about how stuff
9366000	9368000	like that is going to affect printers
9368000	9370000	and the print shops that rely
9370000	9372000	on having a steady client, a big
9372000	9374000	client, especially one like Sony, or not
9374000	9376000	Sony, but, you know, the magazine,
9376000	9378000	you know, it's
9378000	9380000	just gonna put a couple
9380000	9382000	more, you know, little nails in
9382000	9384000	while they're building that coffin.
9384000	9386000	What do you think about this comment from Dan Shadow
9386000	9388000	in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com?
9388000	9390000	No one reads, and the internet is full of pictures.
9390000	9392000	Speak
9392000	9394000	for yourself. Well, here's
9394000	9396000	something like, you know, the whole
9396000	9398000	shift from digital, or
9398000	9400000	from print to digital.
9400000	9402000	Game Informer has a digital
9402000	9404000	version. How did they get me
9404000	9406000	to switch over to the digital version
9406000	9408000	from print? The
9408000	9410000	Grand Theft Auto information came out this week on
9410000	9412000	the digital version, and two weeks later
9412000	9414000	on print. So I want
9414000	9416000	the digital version.
9416000	9418000	And so that's what it is.
9418000	9420000	It doesn't matter anyways. I thumbed through it once, and then
9420000	9422000	I put it aside, and then I throw
9422000	9424000	them away months later. Loki brings up a
9424000	9426000	good point. Is it that need-to-know-
9426000	9428000	right-now mentality, especially
9428000	9430000	in the gaming culture, that might be
9430000	9432000	hurting magazines a little bit? Well, yeah.
9432000	9434000	Here's the thing, too. It probably doesn't help.
9434000	9436000	All that Grand Theft Auto
9436000	9438000	information, immediately as soon as it hit
9438000	9440000	the digital version,
9440000	9442000	it hit the NeoGAF
9442000	9444000	forums, and then it hit all the
9444000	9446000	blogs, and it hit all the websites.
9446000	9448000	So even if you didn't subscribe to that magazine,
9448000	9450000	unless you wanted to read the article by
9450000	9452000	yourself, you got all the information that
9452000	9454000	was right there. To wait for
9454000	9456000	it to be in print is just ridiculous.
9456000	9458000	Why would you do that?
9458000	9460000	I mean, other than appreciating
9460000	9462000	the art of printing and all that stuff.
9462000	9464000	And pretty pictures to look at.
9464000	9466000	But now that you have digital versions,
9466000	9468000	there's really nothing that's exclusive
9468000	9470000	anymore to them, momentarily
9470000	9472000	at least.
9472000	9474000	Hell,
9474000	9476000	let's be honest. It took them a day
9476000	9478000	or two to get my digital version
9478000	9480000	converted over.
9480000	9482000	I looked at screen caps,
9482000	9484000	because you can do screen caps
9484000	9486000	on your iPod or iPhone
9486000	9488000	or on your iPad,
9488000	9490000	and I looked at screen caps
9490000	9492000	of the whole articles. I didn't even need the
9492000	9494000	digital version to read that stuff.
9494000	9496000	So,
9496000	9498000	yeah, it's like, it's
9498000	9500000	kind of, you know,
9500000	9502000	unless you have these exclusive articles
9502000	9504000	that are in your magazine, and you're not sharing
9504000	9506000	this stuff, you know, online, and even then,
9506000	9508000	when the print article comes out,
9508000	9510000	people are just going to post it on a forum, which is
9510000	9512000	going to get posted everywhere else.
9512000	9514000	It just, it moves too fast
9514000	9516000	for print.
9516000	9518000	Alright, let's move on to
9519000	9521000	Well, this is,
9521000	9523000	as soon as it works,
9523000	9525000	this is, um, an old
9525000	9527000	format that had a
9527000	9529000	game released in 2010.
9529000	9531000	Um, have you ever heard of
9531000	9533000	Pier Solar?
9533000	9535000	It was released in 2010 for the Sega Mega Drive,
9535000	9537000	or, as we know it, the Genesis,
9537000	9539000	and it's, uh,
9539000	9541000	like, a 64 megabyte
9541000	9543000	cartridge. It was huge.
9543000	9545000	And it was
9545000	9547000	very well received. Now, the
9547000	9549000	group Watermelon, the developer,
9549000	9551000	has a Kickstarter to release
9551000	9553000	an HD version to come out
9553000	9555000	for Xbox 360, PC, Mac,
9555000	9557000	Linux, and Dreamcast.
9557000	9559000	Um, the game already
9559000	9561000	has, uh, over 50 hours
9561000	9563000	of gameplay, 300 locations,
9563000	9565000	and 800 NPCs.
9565000	9567000	I actually watched
9567000	9569000	the, um, the little, uh,
9569000	9571000	interview on here, and it looks
9571000	9573000	pretty neat. There, um,
9573000	9575000	if you pledge $15, you'll receive
9575000	9577000	a copy of, uh,
9577000	9579000	the game when it's released
9579000	9581000	for whatever platform you wish, and $45
9581000	9583000	get a limited edition
9583000	9585000	4 CD copy of the soundtrack
9585000	9587000	or a digital bundle consisting of the game
9587000	9589000	on Xbox 360,
9589000	9591000	PC, Mac,
9591000	9593000	Linux, one of the three,
9593000	9595000	as well as a digital copy of the soundtrack.
9595000	9597000	There's also a limited edition for $125.
9597000	9599000	There's a hard copy of the game
9599000	9601000	for either Dreamcast or PC,
9601000	9603000	Mac, Linux,
9603000	9605000	and, um, the Pierce Solar
9605000	9607000	guidebook, signed, uh,
9607000	9609000	lithograph, and three figurines.
9609000	9611000	There's only going to be 250
9611000	9613000	of them, uh, produced,
9613000	9615000	and as of, uh,
9615000	9617000	when I was reading this, there were, uh,
9617000	9619000	just under a hundred pre-ordered. This actually
9619000	9621000	might be the first one I put money into.
9621000	9623000	The game looks awesome.
9623000	9625000	Um,
9625000	9627000	and, uh,
9627000	9629000	there were, uh,
9629000	9631000	the, uh, $999
9631000	9633000	Kickstarter
9633000	9635000	exclusive Dreamcast ones,
9635000	9637000	um, have already been
9637000	9639000	ordered, so,
9639000	9641000	they are currently at $76,468
9641000	9643000	out of their $139,000
9643000	9645000	goal.
9645000	9647000	And they have 26 days to go,
9647000	9649000	so I want this, and
9649000	9651000	I think everyone should check it out.
9651000	9653000	Bye.
9653000	9655000	Alright, just a few more stories,
9655000	9657000	then we'll get to the mailbag and the FUs of the week.
9657000	9659000	Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com
9661000	9663000	Alright, so,
9663000	9665000	um, I think we talked about this
9665000	9667000	before, but there was some
9667000	9669000	whole controversy about
9669000	9671000	the Navy SEALs actually
9671000	9673000	helping the developers of
9673000	9675000	Medal of Honor Warfighter with some of the
9675000	9677000	details of the game and stuff like that,
9677000	9679000	and it probably doesn't help that they have
9679000	9681000	the whole DLC tying in with that movie
9681000	9683000	Zero Dark Thirty, which is about the whole,
9683000	9685000	you know, SEAL Team 6
9685000	9687000	infiltrating
9687000	9689000	Osama Bin Laden's camp and stuff like that.
9689000	9691000	So anyways,
9691000	9693000	apparently, um,
9693000	9695000	seven SEALs so far have received
9695000	9697000	letters of reprimand,
9697000	9699000	effectively denying them of
9699000	9701000	promotion and also
9701000	9703000	knocking off half their salaries for,
9703000	9705000	or docking them half their salaries for two months.
9705000	9707000	Which, you know, obviously they're
9707000	9709000	probably getting paid by EA anyways, but,
9709000	9711000	um,
9711000	9713000	but yeah, so, that's
9713000	9715000	I don't know, I guess
9715000	9717000	four of the seven affected
9717000	9719000	are still engaging in, um,
9719000	9721000	active duty and are still under investigation.
9721000	9723000	But, um,
9723000	9725000	that kind of sucks.
9725000	9727000	But then again, if you're in the military and you're
9727000	9729000	revealing military secrets to a game company,
9729000	9731000	it's
9731000	9733000	kind of a problem.
9735000	9737000	This is having some huge
9737000	9739000	ramifications, too. This is the type of thing
9739000	9741000	I'm hearing reported on CNN.
9741000	9743000	Yeah. You know? So.
9743000	9745000	Well, I mean, that's kind of like
9745000	9747000	even a breach of security as far as
9747000	9749000	national security.
9749000	9751000	You know, if you're talking like
9751000	9753000	tactics and stuff like that, that
9753000	9755000	your SEAL team deployed
9755000	9757000	to infiltrate, you know,
9757000	9759000	this compound and stuff, that's just
9759000	9761000	you're not supposed to be sharing
9761000	9763000	that stuff. Right. Right.
9763000	9765000	How historically
9765000	9767000	accurate is too historically accurate?
9767000	9769000	Especially when it's so
9769000	9771000	recent, you know? Yeah.
9771000	9773000	Well, moving on to something completely
9773000	9775000	different. Capcom is
9775000	9777000	apparently going to be hiring 1000
9777000	9779000	people. That's pretty cool.
9779000	9781000	1000 people over the course of 10
9781000	9783000	years. But that would be adding to the
9783000	9785000	1500 game developers that are on staff
9785000	9787000	currently. This is a
9787000	9789000	Capcom representative saying, quote,
9789000	9791000	we want to further improve the quality of our games
9791000	9793000	by maintaining an internal game development
9793000	9795000	team. The purpose of
9795000	9797000	increasing our game developer team is to create
9797000	9799000	a larger percentage of our games internally.
9799000	9801000	Therefore, we believe that there will be
9801000	9803000	no significant change in total development
9803000	9805000	expenditures, mainly because we will
9805000	9807000	be shifting outsourced operations to
9807000	9809000	our own workforce. That's
9809000	9811000	pretty neat because, you know, there's
9811000	9813000	a lot of that outsourcing that goes on in the gaming
9813000	9815000	industry as well. And, you know, for all the
9815000	9817000	Capcom is evil chats that go on
9817000	9819000	and, you know, certainly they've made some pretty shitty
9819000	9821000	decisions over the past couple of years. Let's be real.
9821000	9823000	This is
9823000	9825000	pretty cool that they are going to be bringing a lot
9825000	9827000	of jobs back.
9827000	9829000	Do notice, though, that that
9829000	9831000	doesn't necessarily mean it's a thousand jobs here.
9831000	9833000	It's probably a thousand jobs in Japan.
9833000	9835000	But, you know, still, more
9835000	9837000	internally developed games, I think, means they can
9837000	9839000	kind of keep a closer eye on things and hopefully
9839000	9841000	get some
9841000	9843000	better products. We'll see.
9843000	9845000	Interesting.
9845000	9847000	So,
9847000	9849000	Capcom. Sounds like they're almost
9849000	9851000	it's almost double, but not
9851000	9853000	quite. So.
9853000	9855000	All right. Well, let's get to our
9855000	9857000	mailbag segment.
9857000	9859000	Every week you guys send us emails
9859000	9861000	mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com
9861000	9863000	and we read some of our
9863000	9865000	favorites here on the air.
9865000	9867000	Dark Soccer, why don't you
9867000	9869000	dive into the mailbag head first and read some
9869000	9871000	emails for us. Just three.
9871000	9873000	Just three?
9873000	9875000	First of all, this one's a little
9875000	9877000	long, but I'll try to get through it quickly.
9877000	9879000	Hey, OLR, AZHP here. I heard you guys talk
9879000	9881000	about Rhode Island suing 38 Studios for
9881000	9883000	$75 million, basically assuming that Rhode Island was
9883000	9885000	in the right for lawsuit. It seemed like there
9885000	9887000	were some assumptions being made, so I wanted to clear up some
9887000	9889000	misconceptions. The lawsuit is
9889000	9891000	not as straightforward as 38 Studios didn't put out
9891000	9893000	a game and we want our money. 38 Studios
9893000	9895000	declared bankruptcy, which typically prevents
9895000	9897000	a company from being pursued by creditors, in this
9897000	9899000	case the state of Rhode Island. However, Rhode Island
9899000	9901000	suit claims that 38 Studios and Kurt
9901000	9903000	Schilling misled Rhode Island
9903000	9905000	as to the difficulties involved with putting
9905000	9907000	out an MMO, and because Rhode Island was
9907000	9909000	misled that $75 million was loaned in
9909000	9911000	poor trust and should be repaid.
9911000	9913000	There's another misconception I wanted to clear up.
9913000	9915000	Rhode Island approached 38 Studios
9915000	9917000	promising the $75 million
9917000	9919000	loan and tax breaks if 38 Studios
9919000	9921000	would move their operation to
9921000	9923000	Rhode Island in the first place. Basically, they
9923000	9925000	wanted 38 Studios to come to Rhode Island.
9925000	9927000	This is basically like a bank saying,
9927000	9929000	hey, we'll give you a good deal on a
9929000	9931000	loan to buy a house, lending you the money,
9931000	9933000	you losing your job, going bankrupt and foreclosing
9933000	9935000	due to unforeseen circumstances, and the bank saying
9935000	9937000	whoa, whoa, whoa, you didn't tell me there was a possibility
9937000	9939000	you would lose your job. We want our money back.
9939000	9941000	We're going to take your house.
9941000	9943000	So as you guys can see, it's not as
9943000	9945000	clear cut that Rhode Island deserves any money
9945000	9947000	at all. If you make an investment and it
9947000	9949000	doesn't pay off, in my opinion, you should go suck it up
9949000	9951000	and take your lumps. But try telling that to
9951000	9953000	the governor of Rhode Island. Just my two cents on the matter
9953000	9955000	is HP OLR's premier gold star
9955000	9957000	recipient. You know, I think that's a
9957000	9959000	good point that he brings up, is that, you know,
9959000	9961000	Rhode Island did, and I thought we kind of
9961000	9963000	touched on this a little bit last week because,
9963000	9965000	and I'm going to say it again now,
9965000	9967000	why was it so goddamn important
9967000	9969000	that they get this guy in the first place?
9969000	9971000	You know, and I remember I mentioned last week,
9971000	9973000	were we blinded by our sports culture?
9973000	9975000	Where we hold these sportsmen
9975000	9977000	that do so well in such high regard.
9977000	9979000	You know,
9979000	9981000	was that really Rhode Island's mistake
9981000	9983000	possibly? And yeah,
9983000	9985000	if that was their mistake, then they in turn need
9985000	9987000	to pay for that. You know, I don't know.
9987000	9989000	But like some of our chatters were
9989000	9991000	saying last week, you know, I say all this,
9991000	9993000	you know, and I know it sounds really
9993000	9995000	cold and really mean, and then I'm like anti-
9995000	9997000	sport. I'm not. I'm not any of those things.
9997000	9999000	I am. I'm kidding.
9999000	10001000	And I think
10001000	10003000	Curt Schilling and all them meant
10003000	10005000	well, but
10005000	10007000	you know, I would like
10007000	10009000	to do a lot of things. Are you going to give
10009000	10011000	me 75 million dollars because I mean well
10011000	10013000	and I have good intentions and some real good ideas?
10015000	10017000	Probably not.
10017000	10019000	You're going to expect to see some things.
10019000	10021000	You know, I just, I
10021000	10023000	I just think
10023000	10025000	the celebrity of it all
10025000	10027000	is what's really to blame at the end of the day.
10027000	10029000	But, anyhow.
10029000	10031000	Next one is
10031000	10033000	and I'm going to save the biggest
10033000	10035000	for last, so. Next one
10035000	10037000	is just a quick update on a game I talked about
10037000	10039000	last time I emailed.
10039000	10041000	And this comes from Catastrophic Moggy, by the way.
10041000	10043000	It's Persona 4 Arena
10043000	10045000	will not make it to Europe this year.
10045000	10047000	I heard about that. You guys got screwed
10047000	10049000	because that's the region locked one, huh?
10049000	10051000	That is so messed up. And people wondered
10051000	10053000	why we bitched about it being region locked.
10053000	10055000	I was a pretty big Shin Megami Tensei fan.
10055000	10057000	I was really looking forward
10057000	10059000	to this game and we still have no idea
10059000	10061000	when it will be released. Only that it won't be
10061000	10063000	this year. Sigh.
10063000	10065000	Excuse me.
10065000	10067000	You guys got hosed.
10067000	10069000	That's really unfortunate.
10069000	10071000	I really don't know what
10071000	10073000	else to say except that, you know,
10073000	10075000	I wouldn't fault you for
10075000	10077000	pirating it at that point.
10077000	10079000	I'm not supposed to encourage that.
10079000	10081000	You can't really if it's region locked.
10081000	10083000	Are you suggesting
10083000	10085000	that people can't work around that?
10085000	10087000	Well, you can, but you need
10087000	10089000	a J-Tech system on Xbox 360
10089000	10091000	or a recent glitch hack system.
10091000	10093000	That's what I thought.
10093000	10095000	And the last email
10095000	10097000	comes from your boyfriend.
10097000	10099000	Loki's boyfriend?
10099000	10101000	No.
10101000	10103000	Yes, Loki's boyfriend.
10103000	10105000	That was too easy.
10105000	10107000	Hi, Alan.
10107000	10109000	I know you don't. Hi, Alan.
10109000	10111000	This question is for Dr. Sakurai
10111000	10113000	and it's related to Mass Effect.
10113000	10115000	So the upcoming
10115000	10117000	Omega DLC looks pretty rad, but starting
10117000	10119000	with ME3 proper, Bioware
10119000	10121000	made some really glaring weird sexist mistakes
10121000	10123000	both in Fem Shep's handling
10123000	10125000	as well as her relationship soiling
10125000	10127000	Kayden for a lot of shippers who don't give a fuck
10127000	10129000	about Dude Shep. Me included.
10129000	10131000	Thanks to this,
10131000	10133000	many in the fandom have joked that the female
10133000	10135000	versions of Mass Effect aliens will end up
10135000	10137000	being male face plus bad perm plus
10137000	10139000	stock tits armor.
10139000	10141000	My question is, how do you feel
10141000	10143000	about Nereen having proper
10143000	10145000	separated breasts in screenshots
10145000	10147000	instead of just a larger breastplate region
10147000	10149000	in her robe, considering that Turians are
10149000	10151000	clearly supposed to be avian, reptilian, or both?
10151000	10153000	I'm not asking if you're offended
10153000	10155000	personally, though if you are, let it out,
10155000	10157000	but from a design perspective, since
10157000	10159000	they otherwise did a good job on her face
10159000	10161000	and had detailing. And that's from Alan.
10161000	10163000	First of all,
10163000	10165000	I actually didn't notice she had boobs.
10165000	10167000	I thought she just had plating.
10167000	10169000	Or maybe like a
10169000	10171000	kind of segmented chest plate type of thing.
10171000	10173000	Because, and I
10173000	10175000	didn't even really look, think to look
10175000	10177000	because of cut dialogue
10177000	10179000	in Mass Effect 2.
10179000	10181000	And that's what I linked to you earlier.
10181000	10183000	That I wanted to play.
10183000	10185000	Oh, yeah, sure.
10185000	10187000	You're like looking at me like
10187000	10189000	what? Yes, yes,
10189000	10191000	keep talking. Alright, hold on, what am I playing
10191000	10193000	here? It's the groundskeeper
10193000	10195000	on the Citadel in Mass Effect
10195000	10197000	2.
10197000	10199000	Good evening
10199000	10201000	human. It is evening
10201000	10203000	isn't it? Without day and night
10203000	10205000	I lose track.
10205000	10207000	I shipped in from Pallavin last month.
10207000	10209000	I'm still getting my bearings.
10209000	10211000	You'd be surprised how much a trained
10211000	10213000	horticulturalist can earn here.
10213000	10215000	The nicest thing about being on the Citadel
10215000	10217000	has to be the drinks.
10217000	10219000	You might not believe it, but my
10219000	10221000	species hasn't invented many
10221000	10223000	intoxicants. I'm constantly
10223000	10225000	amazed by human creativity
10225000	10227000	when it comes to brewing and distilling.
10227000	10229000	Ever had aquarian thruster
10229000	10231000	fuel? Must be 99%
10231000	10233000	alcohol. I think they
10233000	10235000	distill it from raw antimatter.
10235000	10237000	Antimatter alcohol.
10237000	10239000	Excuse me for asking, but
10239000	10241000	you're a female, right?
10241000	10243000	You got those funny bumps.
10243000	10245000	Like an asari. Every time I come
10245000	10247000	in here some asari asks me to dance.
10247000	10249000	First of all, turians don't
10249000	10251000	dance. Second of all, asari
10251000	10253000	have those funny bumps that get
10253000	10255000	in the way.
10255000	10257000	That's what I was trying to get to.
10257000	10259000	That was cut
10259000	10261000	dialogue. Basically, you know where
10261000	10263000	you go talk to him after the croak and ask if
10263000	10265000	there's fish in the reservoir?
10265000	10267000	That was cut dialogue for
10267000	10269000	him. You got some funny bumps, Dark
10269000	10271000	Sakura. Shut up.
10271000	10273000	Those are some big bumps.
10273000	10275000	Shut
10275000	10277000	up.
10277000	10279000	You know, I actually did have a kitten stand on
10279000	10281000	my boobs yesterday. Did you?
10281000	10283000	My friend drove me to PetSmart and I
10283000	10285000	was close to throwing down 60 bucks for this kitten
10285000	10287000	because it reminds me of Shermy, but
10287000	10289000	that wouldn't be fair to Shermy's memory.
10289000	10291000	But yeah, the kitten passed the standing on boobs test.
10291000	10293000	Just stood there and then
10293000	10295000	curled up and purred. Like, okay. I'll have to hold you.
10295000	10297000	But yeah, back to
10297000	10299000	Mass Effect.
10299000	10301000	So I actually didn't even look, and I have
10301000	10303000	some of the comics.
10303000	10305000	I didn't read some of the
10305000	10307000	I looked at pictures of what the female
10307000	10309000	turians looked like
10309000	10311000	in some of those comics and
10311000	10313000	I had the
10313000	10315000	Yeah, oh my god.
10315000	10317000	I'm sorry for
10317000	10319000	She
10319000	10321000	doesn't look like super endowed.
10321000	10323000	Yeah, it's not like overly sexualized.
10323000	10325000	I think is important to keep in mind.
10325000	10327000	It's not like she's got some tig old biddies.
10327000	10329000	You know, it's just like, okay, she's got some
10329000	10331000	funny bumps. That's it.
10331000	10333000	It looks like it
10333000	10335000	I mean, they kind of look
10335000	10337000	flattish. Like, more like an extended ribcage.
10337000	10339000	Yeah. Like a, well I mean
10339000	10341000	in general, I think turian ribcage is supposed to be
10341000	10343000	really high if you ever looked at the naked model.
10343000	10345000	It's a fucking alien race. Why are we
10345000	10347000	so, like
10347000	10349000	in a fake video game, it's a fake
10349000	10351000	alien race. Like, why are we so like, oh, but
10351000	10353000	it's not lizard accurate. Well, it's not a
10353000	10355000	fucking lizard. Those are the worst
10355000	10357000	press I've seen on lizard yet.
10357000	10359000	Well, I mean, my point was
10359000	10361000	it's not something I noticed because
10361000	10363000	first of all, I didn't really see evidence of it
10363000	10365000	in the comics. And there was
10365000	10367000	that cut dialogue. I didn't think to look
10367000	10369000	for boobs. You know,
10369000	10371000	I was like, okay, turian chicks don't
10371000	10373000	have boobs. Good for them. They
10373000	10375000	probably regurgitate to feed their
10375000	10377000	young. If they're based off of birds or
10377000	10379000	lizards, then that's kind of gross, but
10379000	10381000	Alan is in our chat room right now and
10381000	10383000	says, it's more of an issue that they are hard
10383000	10385000	and rough and scaly, but suddenly
10385000	10387000	soft jubilees. How do you know
10387000	10389000	those aren't some rough, scaly boobs?
10389000	10391000	How do you know they're not all like, how do you know
10391000	10393000	those aren't the slimiest tits you'll ever see?
10393000	10395000	Remember Morden and his chafing?
10395000	10397000	We'll prescribe analgesics.
10397000	10399000	May cause chafing.
10399000	10401000	But, um,
10401000	10403000	but, um,
10403000	10405000	I think that it's not
10405000	10407000	so much of a big deal. I think
10407000	10409000	I may
10409000	10411000	feel differently when I actually play it
10411000	10413000	and see them in action,
10413000	10415000	see if they bounce. But
10415000	10417000	it didn't look like boob boobs, you
10417000	10419000	know? It just looked like
10419000	10421000	a hint of boob.
10421000	10423000	Alan in chat is apologizing. Sorry
10423000	10425000	I asked. I thought it was interesting. No, it is
10425000	10427000	I'm yelling at the internet.
10427000	10429000	I'm not yelling at you. I would never
10429000	10431000	yell at you. I cannot wait, by the way, to
10431000	10433000	play through Omega with FemShep.
10433000	10435000	With Team Badass Bitch.
10435000	10437000	Cause Aria
10437000	10439000	and Nereen.
10439000	10441000	Yeah, Omega has one rule.
10441000	10443000	Don't fuck with Aria.
10443000	10445000	That's my rule too. Don't
10445000	10447000	fuck with me.
10447000	10449000	Good times.
10449000	10451000	Yeah, and Tigerclaw is right. Javok
10451000	10453000	did call Solarian's lizard
10453000	10455000	people and also said that
10455000	10457000	raw Solarian liver
10457000	10459000	is a delicacy.
10459000	10461000	And that they used to eat flies.
10461000	10463000	Alright, let's get, is that it for emails?
10463000	10465000	Yes, it is. Let's get to the FUs
10465000	10467000	of the week. Every week we rant
10467000	10469000	on this show because we can.
10475000	10477000	This is bad.
10477000	10479000	Here is justice. Here is punishment.
10479000	10481000	Don't care.
10481000	10483000	This is fucked up.
10487000	10489000	I have a huge FU that goes
10489000	10491000	to a condition called angular
10491000	10493000	calitis.
10493000	10495000	Which some people can use
10495000	10497000	for cold source or canker source.
10497000	10499000	What they are is when you get a lesion
10499000	10501000	in the corner of your mouth
10501000	10503000	that forms kind of a pussy scab.
10503000	10505000	And it happens to lots of people.
10505000	10507000	But the thing that I hate about it
10507000	10509000	you know, yeah this happened. It happens
10509000	10511000	from a vitamin deficiency
10511000	10513000	and basically a lot of stress.
10513000	10515000	But
10515000	10517000	what I hate is waking up in the morning
10517000	10519000	and having to yawn and forgetting all about it
10519000	10521000	and then just it hurt really badly.
10521000	10523000	And also drivers
10523000	10525000	in the parking lot and Whole Foods
10525000	10527000	you know, screw all you entitled rich people.
10527000	10529000	Loki.
10529000	10531000	Fuck you to Ford in my car.
10531000	10533000	He's breaking.
10533000	10535000	Like, I had the last
10535000	10537000	last time I took it in to get repaired
10537000	10539000	which you know was about $1200 for the repairs
10539000	10541000	I think. You know, he took a bunch of stuff
10541000	10543000	and then broke down a month later.
10543000	10545000	The guy there who had this
10545000	10547000	really weird growth on his face
10547000	10549000	said, oh yeah I've seen
10549000	10551000	those cars last for
10551000	10553000	300,000 miles. Yeah, after you replace
10553000	10555000	every goddamn part in the car
10555000	10557000	four times
10557000	10559000	it's probably lasted that long.
10559000	10561000	But then again, it's not the original car
10561000	10563000	anymore now is it?
10563000	10565000	That's it.
10565000	10567000	If you want to know my FU of the week, refer to the top of the show.
10567000	10569000	It was kind of a shitty weekend.
10569000	10571000	I don't want to go back to work tomorrow.
10571000	10573000	Wham.
10573000	10575000	But I guess we have to be funny.
10575000	10577000	Alright, a couple more
10577000	10579000	news stories for you guys and then we'll open up the
10579000	10581000	Skype line quickly at 1877 Game OLR.
10581000	10583000	I emphasize quickly, we might only do
10583000	10585000	one or two calls tonight depending on who
10585000	10587000	all tries to get in. And of course
10587000	10589000	Twitter topics, we'll get through as many of those as we can.
10589000	10591000	Twitter.com slash OLR. Loki.
10591000	10593000	So, Silicon Knights, you remember they were
10593000	10595000	suing Epic Games
10595000	10597000	over the whole, you know,
10597000	10599000	oh Unreal 3 is so hard
10599000	10601000	to use.
10601000	10603000	And they made our game shit.
10603000	10605000	Not because we suck or anything.
10605000	10607000	But they lost.
10607000	10609000	Boop.
10609000	10611000	So on top of that,
10611000	10613000	not only did they lose
10613000	10615000	but the new ruling
10615000	10617000	I guess doubled the damages
10617000	10619000	from 4.5 million to
10619000	10621000	9 million. And on top
10621000	10623000	of that they also have to destroy
10623000	10625000	any games that they
10625000	10627000	have, any
10627000	10629000	unsold games that they have
10629000	10631000	using the Unreal 3 engine.
10631000	10633000	So,
10633000	10635000	I don't know.
10635000	10637000	So I guess that means
10637000	10639000	two human
10639000	10641000	X-Men, Destiny,
10641000	10643000	Siren in Maelstorm,
10643000	10645000	The Sandman, and The Box
10645000	10647000	slash Ritualus.
10649000	10651000	All these games I was
10651000	10653000	a really big fan of.
10653000	10655000	So if they're destroying all these games
10655000	10657000	would that mean that they have to con-
10657000	10659000	They're going in a landfill.
10659000	10661000	By destroying, does that mean that they just
10661000	10663000	get to work on them a little bit longer?
10663000	10665000	Yeah.
10667000	10669000	That's what you get
10669000	10671000	when you place the blame on somebody else.
10671000	10673000	When, you know, really it was just your
10673000	10675000	inability to program these games.
10677000	10679000	Alright, well one more story for you guys.
10679000	10681000	Then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1877
10681000	10683000	Game OLR or our username on
10683000	10685000	Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. This is
10685000	10687000	a story about Charles Hwang.
10687000	10689000	If you don't know that name you probably know
10689000	10691000	something he co-created. It's Guitar Hero.
10691000	10693000	Well what's he doing now?
10693000	10695000	Is he doing another music game or doing
10695000	10697000	something else with gaming?
10697000	10699000	Not exactly.
10699000	10701000	It's called Green Throttle Games
10701000	10703000	is the company
10703000	10705000	he's working on.
10705000	10707000	It's a mobile to TV app and
10707000	10709000	controller. What it's trying to do is turning
10709000	10711000	smartphone games into a
10711000	10713000	big screen experience by connecting
10713000	10715000	a mobile device directly to an
10715000	10717000	HDTV. This would be
10717000	10719000	playable on wireless, Bluetooth controllers
10719000	10721000	via what's called the Green
10721000	10723000	Throttle Arena app.
10723000	10725000	In other words, you know,
10725000	10727000	I think it's a great idea but
10727000	10729000	Apple could knock this out of business in a
10729000	10731000	heartbeat. It's a dangerous territory
10731000	10733000	I think. There's a lot of people have been saying
10733000	10735000	Apple TV is only
10735000	10737000	moments away from doing something like this.
10737000	10739000	I don't know.
10739000	10741000	That's all fan wank and Apple hasn't
10741000	10743000	done it. My only issue with this
10743000	10745000	and great for him to
10745000	10747000	do something like this but
10747000	10749000	you can do this with any Bluetooth controller.
10749000	10751000	Seriously, you take a Bluetooth
10751000	10753000	controller, you pair it with
10753000	10755000	your phone or device,
10755000	10757000	you get the TV out cable
10757000	10759000	hook it up to your TV via
10759000	10761000	HDMI. Boom. You have
10761000	10763000	exactly what he's selling.
10763000	10765000	Except, you know, now they're going to have all these
10765000	10767000	apps that are within this other app
10767000	10769000	that are basically going to all support
10769000	10771000	this device.
10771000	10773000	But you can do that right now
10773000	10775000	with any controller. In fact,
10775000	10777000	you can not only do it with any controller, you can
10777000	10779000	do it with a controller you already have. Like
10779000	10781000	a DualShock 3 controller or
10781000	10783000	a Wii U or
10783000	10785000	a Wii Remote
10785000	10787000	with the Classic Controller Pro
10787000	10789000	or something like that tied in with it.
10789000	10791000	They have a lot of games that do support these things
10791000	10793000	and with a TV out
10793000	10795000	cable
10795000	10797000	you can do this already. But
10797000	10799000	they're wrapping in a nice package I guess
10799000	10801000	so that, you know, it's easy for consumers
10801000	10803000	to find all the games that support this controller.
10803000	10805000	And it's important to note they are also
10805000	10807000	developing their own games in house.
10807000	10809000	So, you know, even if Apple were to
10809000	10811000	push a button and really fuck this idea
10811000	10813000	over, they'd still have, hopefully, some
10813000	10815000	solid games to fall back on.
10815000	10817000	I'm surprised they haven't done anything like that.
10817000	10819000	And, to be fair, I want to throw this out here
10819000	10821000	to give this whole thing a break
10821000	10823000	because I don't want to sound like I'm poo-pooing the idea
10823000	10825000	because I'm not. I would love
10825000	10827000	to be able to play smartphone games on the TV.
10827000	10829000	There's a lot I would like to be able to do that with.
10829000	10831000	Um,
10831000	10833000	but, um,
10833000	10835000	oh, that's my train of thought. Where was I going with this?
10835000	10837000	The, um,
10837000	10839000	Radio Guy's Worst Enemy
10839000	10841000	Derailed Train
10841000	10843000	I think a lot of the games, also, it seems like
10843000	10845000	a lot of them are touch-based. Well, not necessarily
10845000	10847000	the games that they're pitching, but like, um,
10847000	10849000	you know, like Angry Birds or something like that.
10849000	10851000	I don't know what I was going to say.
10851000	10853000	Open Faint is like an Apple,
10853000	10855000	or is an iOS
10855000	10857000	thing that a lot of gaming, you know, companies
10857000	10859000	use to plug into their games to do online
10859000	10861000	leaderboards and so forth. Game Center
10861000	10863000	hasn't put that out of business because
10863000	10865000	Open Faint, I guess, offers
10865000	10867000	either it's easier to implement or it's a richer
10867000	10869000	package. Multi-platform.
10869000	10871000	Multi-platform as well and so forth.
10871000	10873000	So, you know, who knows?
10873000	10875000	Green Throttle could go multi-platform too, I would think.
10875000	10877000	Hypothetically, you know,
10877000	10879000	with Android tablets or whatever. I don't think even if
10879000	10881000	they did something like that where, you know,
10881000	10883000	Apple TV or whatever had
10883000	10885000	some sort of Bluetooth support, which
10885000	10887000	I, honestly,
10887000	10889000	I'm surprised that that device doesn't have
10889000	10891000	Bluetooth support, you know, the whole Apple TV.
10891000	10893000	You know, what they could do,
10893000	10895000	which would be interesting, is have
10895000	10897000	if you have an Apple TV,
10897000	10899000	because doesn't the Apple TV support
10899000	10901000	like streaming, like you can content
10901000	10903000	stream stuff from your iPod
10903000	10905000	or iPad to
10905000	10907000	the TV. Maybe say you
10907000	10909000	content stream something to
10909000	10911000	the TV and then you use a Bluetooth
10911000	10913000	controller with that and then you can
10913000	10915000	basically use the
10915000	10917000	iPad or
10917000	10919000	iPod or iPhone device
10919000	10921000	as like a tether, almost like, you know,
10921000	10923000	using the Wii
10923000	10925000	Classic Controller,
10925000	10927000	Classic Controller Pro with the Wii.
10927000	10929000	You have to use the Wii Remote as kind of like
10929000	10931000	the Bluetooth tether to that.
10933000	10935000	Alright, well, we're
10935000	10937000	going to move on to the Skype line. 1877
10937000	10939000	Game OLR or our username
10939000	10941000	on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. It is open
10941000	10943000	for business now. In the meantime,
10943000	10945000	we'll get some last minute stories
10945000	10947000	and I want to do some Twitter topics
10947000	10949000	as well. Things that were sent into
10949000	10951000	twitter.com slash
10951000	10953000	OLR. I want
10953000	10955000	to do this one first. This is from
10955000	10957000	dammit, come on, load.
10957000	10959000	Here we go. This one's from
10959000	10961000	actdeft. Give a listen
10961000	10963000	to the Wii U menu music.
10963000	10965000	It's really good and entrancing.
10965000	10967000	I did not know that this was
10967000	10969000	out, but apparently here it is.
10969000	10981000	Here's the thing though.
10981000	10983000	I want to go into skeptic mode here because
10983000	10985000	I noticed that the YouTube here
10985000	10987000	has a link to a website where it says
10987000	10989000	full album available and
10989000	10991000	then it says check out more Wii U music
10991000	10993000	and news at such and such website and
10993000	10995000	it's not an official Nintendo site either.
10995000	10997000	Now I'm not saying maybe these guys didn't get a Wii U
10997000	10999000	but I'm always kind of curious
10999000	11001000	when it's this much blatant
11001000	11003000	like go here, go to this site.
11003000	11005000	I don't know. I'm just saying.
11005000	11007000	I'm just saying.
11007000	11009000	Could be legit.
11009000	11011000	What do you think?
11011000	11013000	Is this it? Is this the real deal?
11013000	11015000	It sounds pretty Nintendo-y.
11015000	11017000	It does sound a little pretty Nintendo-y. I believe it.
11017000	11019000	Yeah, I'm not sure.
11019000	11021000	We'll know within days
11021000	11023000	because those things
11023000	11025000	are going to be out very, very,
11025000	11027000	very soon.
11027000	11029000	Uh, let's go to phones.
11029000	11031000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
11031000	11033000	Hey, so we're Nate. How's it going?
11033000	11035000	Hey, good. How are you, Nate?
11035000	11037000	Going good. Listen to all y'all
11037000	11039000	talks about vaporware and
11039000	11041000	green throttle and Wii U music.
11041000	11043000	Yeah.
11043000	11045000	I just wanted to ask you all
11045000	11047000	who do you think is going to win the upcoming console war?
11047000	11049000	Who's going to win the upcoming console war?
11049000	11051000	And to answer your question
11051000	11053000	whether that was legit or not, yes, it is.
11053000	11055000	We actually have more menu music.
11055000	11057000	Because Kotaku, they were reviewing
11057000	11059000	they have their own Wii U thing
11059000	11061000	and they wouldn't post a story like that if it was completely
11061000	11063000	wrong, you know, because they have a Wii U
11063000	11065000	to compare that to.
11065000	11067000	Ah, I see. Okay, thank you for that clarification.
11067000	11069000	I'm always a little skeptical when it's the internet.
11069000	11071000	Alright, so Nate's
11071000	11073000	loaded question. No, I'm kidding.
11073000	11075000	It's not a loaded question. It's a tough question.
11075000	11077000	Who's going to win the upcoming console war?
11077000	11079000	Nate, I think it's too damn early to tell.
11079000	11081000	And I think you only have one console.
11082000	11084000	Well, here's the thing
11084000	11086000	because we don't know what
11086000	11088000	PlayStation 4 and what the new
11088000	11090000	Xbox have under their belt.
11090000	11092000	We're not
11092000	11094000	really going to know that until E3.
11098000	11100000	Right now we have to also
11100000	11102000	evaluate, you know, how is the Wii U
11102000	11104000	going to do? We're hearing
11104000	11106000	about sellouts and pre-order
11106000	11108000	stuff and that they're hard to get
11108000	11110000	but how much
11110000	11112000	of that is legitimately
11112000	11114000	everybody wants them in demand and how much of that
11114000	11116000	is Nintendo is slowly
11116000	11118000	like a faucet
11118000	11120000	drip letting these consoles out
11120000	11122000	to create that artificial
11122000	11124000	demand. Well, I'm going to tell you
11124000	11126000	right now who's going to win the whole console wars
11126000	11128000	here and it's going to come out of left field
11128000	11130000	here. It's the GE Micro Box
11130000	11132000	microwave slash
11132000	11134000	console.
11134000	11136000	Because we're talking about the future and no one knows what the
11136000	11138000	future is, that's what's going to win. Microwave console.
11140000	11142000	Okay, another question.
11142000	11144000	Alright.
11144000	11146000	Okay, so I'll
11146000	11148000	hear you all talking about Green Throttle.
11148000	11150000	If you
11150000	11152000	have to pick between Green Throttle and
11152000	11154000	Ouya, who would you vote for?
11154000	11156000	Oh, damn.
11156000	11158000	That's a pretty good question because I don't really
11158000	11160000	know enough about Green Throttle
11160000	11162000	yet.
11162000	11164000	Based on presentation
11164000	11166000	and power and
11166000	11168000	fame, glory, money.
11168000	11170000	I'm going to have to go Ouya.
11170000	11172000	Only reason because it's an actual console
11172000	11174000	versus basically
11174000	11176000	Green Throttle is just, okay, we have a controller
11176000	11178000	that's paired with some games that we're making.
11178000	11180000	But it doesn't have any hardware platform
11180000	11182000	that it's meant for. They don't have like their
11182000	11184000	own Android device or something.
11184000	11186000	So you're going to get varied performance depending
11186000	11188000	on what kind of Android device that you have.
11188000	11190000	So that's the only problem there is it's
11190000	11192000	not a standardized platform. Whereas the
11192000	11194000	Ouya is actually going to be a
11194000	11196000	device that they make games for that they know will
11196000	11198000	run well on that platform.
11198000	11200000	I'm going to say the Ouya as well because
11200000	11202000	again, I'm a little concerned about
11202000	11204000	Apple could really
11204000	11206000	knock this Green Throttle thing down a
11206000	11208000	few pegs by doing their own thing.
11208000	11210000	Whereas the Ouya is going to be a little tougher.
11210000	11212000	I think the Ouya is kind of trying to beat Apple
11212000	11214000	at it's own game in a way.
11214000	11216000	I think it's a little different. So I'm going to
11216000	11218000	go Ouya as well.
11218000	11220000	Okay, last question.
11220000	11222000	What
11222000	11224000	game are you giving
11224000	11226000	the best game to come out
11226000	11228000	between now
11228000	11230000	and summer?
11230000	11232000	Now and summer. So of all these games
11232000	11234000	that got pushed back to 2013
11234000	11236000	that make up the first and second
11236000	11238000	quarter releases, what's going to be the best game
11238000	11240000	to come out? I'm going to say Mass Effect Trilogy
11240000	11242000	on PS3.
11242000	11244000	No, no, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
11244000	11246000	I am really
11246000	11248000	looking forward to the Tomb Raider
11248000	11250000	reboot. That's not coming out before
11250000	11252000	summer. Oh, get out.
11252000	11254000	I thought it was pushed back to like March.
11256000	11258000	Yeah, yeah, go look that up in your
11258000	11260000	Funkin' Wagonals.
11260000	11262000	I'm looking forward
11262000	11264000	to Omega. Omega
11264000	11266000	DLC, Mass Effect. Are there any games?
11266000	11268000	Come on. Oh! Omega.
11268000	11270000	I don't know if it'll make summer, Nate,
11270000	11272000	but the Final Fantasy XIV
11272000	11274000	Realm Reborn. No, that's fall next year.
11274000	11276000	I'm damn curious about that.
11276000	11278000	Okay, awesome.
11278000	11280000	Okay, I'll get off your Skype line.
11280000	11282000	I think other people might want to call in.
11282000	11284000	That's alright, buddy. Clearly the
11284000	11286000	correct answer is Grand Theft Auto V.
11286000	11288000	I was going to say, I'm not even going to ask Loki
11288000	11290000	because I know the answer is Grand Theft Auto V.
11290000	11292000	So there you go, a wide variety of answers.
11292000	11294000	With a close second being Bioshock Infinite.
11294000	11296000	Oh, yeah, that's going to be a win, too.
11296000	11298000	Well, Nate, I'm going to turn the tables on you.
11298000	11300000	I got a question for you.
11300000	11302000	Um, I don't, I don't give questions.
11302000	11304000	But, yes.
11304000	11306000	Ask away.
11306000	11308000	Alright, you've asked us about
11308000	11310000	console wars and what we're looking
11310000	11312000	forward to and all this stuff.
11312000	11314000	What do you want to see happen in gaming
11314000	11316000	in 2013?
11316000	11318000	Okay, so,
11318000	11320000	um, I'm just going to be a little
11320000	11322000	vague because there's other things I could talk
11322000	11324000	about but I want to talk about now.
11324000	11326000	Um, I would like to see,
11326000	11328000	um, the rise
11328000	11330000	of indie gaming and also, um,
11330000	11332000	like, far less
11332000	11334000	social games and all these, like, small,
11334000	11336000	like, touchscreen games.
11336000	11338000	I would like to see less of in 2013.
11338000	11340000	Alright, so you want to see
11340000	11342000	indie games come up, but you want to see social
11342000	11344000	games go away. I got to tell you, though, buddy,
11344000	11346000	that's where a lot of indies get their start
11346000	11348000	right now is on iPhone and all that stuff.
11348000	11350000	Are you okay with the mobile games?
11350000	11352000	Um, I don't have a
11352000	11354000	smartphone, so that's, that's like
11354000	11356000	a no. So, so
11356000	11358000	screw everybody else.
11358000	11360000	Um, I'm a consoleer, PCer,
11360000	11362000	um,
11362000	11364000	I try to play Angry Birds, but that's
11364000	11366000	PC. That's, you know what, there's
11366000	11368000	indie, of course, has a huge
11368000	11370000	life on PC and lots of great indie stuff
11370000	11372000	gets their start on PC, so, and
11372000	11374000	I'm with you. I'd like to see some more
11374000	11376000	indie games make it big. You know, uh,
11376000	11378000	the best games to come, we probably
11378000	11380000	don't even know about yet. Think about that.
11380000	11382000	Alright, Nate, thank you
11382000	11384000	for the questions. We appreciate it. Have a
11384000	11386000	good one, buddy, okay? Alright, talk to you later.
11386000	11388000	Alright, you too. Bye.
11388000	11390000	See, I like that. I like the whole
11390000	11392000	you're gonna ask me questions? Oh, yeah, buddy,
11392000	11394000	I got a question for you.
11394000	11396000	Our job sucks,
11396000	11398000	huh? No, I'm kidding. No, I loved it.
11398000	11400000	I love getting questions. 1877
11400000	11402000	Game OLR, or our username on
11402000	11404000	Skype. Orange Lounge Radio!
11404000	11406000	Let's go to the phones.
11408000	11410000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
11410000	11412000	Legend Zaku here. Zaku, you must have
11412000	11414000	loved that interview tonight.
11414000	11416000	Huh? Did you, did you hear our interview
11416000	11418000	with Eddie tonight?
11418000	11420000	Um, yeah, yeah, definitely. I, I
11420000	11422000	just caught, like, the, I guess, the tail end
11422000	11424000	of it. Oh. After, like, watching
11424000	11426000	Walking Dead. For, oh, oh, oh,
11426000	11428000	we got, we got shafted for walking.
11428000	11430000	I, I, I hear it through the show. I'm sorry, but
11430000	11432000	that's kind of, like, religion here.
11432000	11434000	We don't, we don't have blood and guts and
11434000	11436000	zombies yet. I had a stein full of, like, beer ready to go
11436000	11438000	and my snacks. But, yeah,
11438000	11440000	um, I guess
11440000	11442000	this is probably gonna be out of the ordinary, but
11442000	11444000	I've had this, uh,
11444000	11446000	this thing that, had, like,
11446000	11448000	my Steam collection that I've been wanting to,
11448000	11450000	like, wrangle down because I've, like,
11450000	11452000	gotten so many games that I have a
11452000	11454000	backlog. It's created,
11454000	11456000	created such a backlog that I'm not sure
11456000	11458000	how to actually systematically
11458000	11460000	approach having to tackle
11460000	11462000	all these games that I have. I'm gonna post it right
11462000	11464000	now in the chat room.
11464000	11466000	And I'm just, like,
11466000	11468000	like, I have some of them already. I'm putting
11468000	11470000	time on them, but there's still,
11470000	11472000	there's still plenty, like, that I just bought
11472000	11474000	because they were cheap at that point and I just got them
11474000	11476000	for the sake of getting them. But now
11476000	11478000	it's, like, I don't know,
11478000	11480000	like, I'm, like, preventing myself from getting games
11480000	11482000	because of, because it's gonna add,
11482000	11484000	it's gonna add more fuel to the fire.
11484000	11486000	Well, you're doing the right thing by investing
11486000	11488000	99 hours in Skyrim.
11488000	11490000	52 hours Team 76, Battlefield
11490000	11492000	Bad Company. Alright, you got your priorities
11492000	11494000	right. I'm just trying to see if there's a game
11494000	11496000	you're not playing enough.
11496000	11498000	Okay, Torchlight? What's up with this?
11498000	11500000	Less than an hour on Torchlight. You gotta fix that, buddy.
11500000	11502000	Um, I have put in more time,
11502000	11504000	but that was on my Mac.
11504000	11506000	And that was, that was when I was heading
11506000	11508000	down, you know,
11508000	11510000	when I was heading down to Otacon on the train and I
11510000	11512000	didn't even have, like, a connection, so I was playing offline.
11512000	11514000	So that count,
11514000	11516000	that time didn't get counted for yet.
11516000	11518000	Uh, you would make Allen
11518000	11520000	a very sad puppy with all these Half-Life
11520000	11522000	games you own that you haven't even played yet.
11522000	11524000	I know, I know, I'm guilty
11524000	11526000	of that. Alright. And I'm also in
11526000	11528000	between, like, Battlefield 3
11528000	11530000	and Hawks, which is, like, crapping out on me,
11530000	11532000	so I had to switch up to other games. And, uh,
11532000	11534000	Loki, look at this.
11534000	11536000	Loki, look, look, look what he's got here,
11536000	11538000	sitting in his collection untouched. Right there,
11538000	11540000	you see that? Grand Theft Auto 4
11540000	11542000	and episodes from Liberty City. What do you have to
11542000	11544000	say about that? Probably got him really cheap.
11544000	11546000	Yes.
11546000	11548000	You can do that.
11548000	11550000	You know what, if I were to show you my Steam
11550000	11552000	collection and you were to rate me on that same scale,
11552000	11554000	you would be like, Rob, I'm taking that
11554000	11556000	podcast away from you, so you have time to go play these games.
11556000	11558000	Dude, I've got so many indie games that I've
11558000	11560000	bought from all these Humble bundles that I have
11560000	11562000	never played. We're sitting here hazing
11562000	11564000	you on all the stuff you haven't played, but we are
11564000	11566000	the worst when it comes to this
11566000	11568000	stuff. So, you know what, buddy?
11568000	11570000	It's all good. At least you're, uh,
11570000	11572000	supporting these developers.
11572000	11574000	Alright, one more
11574000	11576000	thing. Seeing that Black Friday
11576000	11578000	and the holiday shopping season is upon us,
11578000	11580000	I'm kind of at a crossroads
11580000	11582000	where, like, I don't know what
11582000	11584000	else to invest on my 360 that
11584000	11586000	isn't already out on PC and isn't already
11586000	11588000	on another platform. Like,
11588000	11590000	every time I go to GameStop or any video
11590000	11592000	game store, I'm always hard, I'm always
11592000	11594000	pressed as to trying to find something
11594000	11596000	that, A, obviously isn't
11596000	11598000	PC or on a PS3, and
11598000	11600000	B, isn't, like, a first-person shooter.
11600000	11602000	So it's kind of like finding those,
11602000	11604000	like, that small scope of
11604000	11606000	console exclusives
11606000	11608000	that I can't really play that I wouldn't
11608000	11610000	normally otherwise play on another platform.
11610000	11612000	Honestly, Zaku,
11612000	11614000	if Xbox Live isn't doing it for you
11614000	11616000	and the community on there, and, um,
11616000	11618000	you know, the indie games and some of the stuff that
11618000	11620000	you can download on Xbox, uh,
11620000	11622000	and all that, maybe you should
11622000	11624000	think about offloading your Xbox, because
11624000	11626000	yeah, when it comes to exclusives, you know,
11626000	11628000	Microsoft's got, you know,
11628000	11630000	again, there's Kinect. A PS3 is
11630000	11632000	definitely, yeah, I know, I
11632000	11634000	understand that, you know, I'm kind of
11634000	11636000	contemplating it, but on the
11636000	11638000	other hand, I am
11638000	11640000	long overdue for a PS3. Let's
11640000	11642000	just say that my girlfriend was hinting at
11642000	11644000	trying to avoid, you know, telling me to avoid
11644000	11646000	getting one in the next couple of
11646000	11648000	weeks, so I pretty much, I can
11648000	11650000	pretty much say with certainty that she's
11650000	11652000	probably hinting towards getting me,
11652000	11654000	you know, something like that.
11654000	11656000	What a nice girl. So, I might be able to
11656000	11658000	exploit that
11658000	11660000	avenue in terms of playing the
11660000	11662000	PS3 exclusives that I missed
11662000	11664000	out on, like Gran Turismo 5,
11664000	11666000	the Uncharted series, uh, Metal Gear Solid
11666000	11668000	4. No, Gran Turismo 5 never came out.
11668000	11670000	Did?
11670000	11672000	It's a running joke.
11672000	11674000	That's not what Bobby said.
11674000	11676000	That's not what Bobby said.
11676000	11678000	It did, but it's like,
11678000	11680000	yeah, it's kind of like that
11680000	11682000	red-headed stepchild, but I mean,
11682000	11684000	with GT5, I could plug in, like,
11684000	11686000	a high-end racing wheel.
11686000	11688000	I wouldn't be able to do a Forza,
11688000	11690000	for example, since it's like,
11690000	11692000	I'm not going to play with some virtual,
11692000	11694000	like, wireless wheel that I have to
11694000	11696000	pretend like doing air steering,
11696000	11698000	which I have, which is garbage.
11698000	11700000	You don't have to do air steering with Forza, though.
11700000	11702000	Forza, I, you know, I,
11702000	11704000	Bobby was very kind to Forza, and he wrote
11704000	11706000	the review on vognetwork.com, and
11706000	11708000	I know Actif's a big fan of it as well. I
11708000	11710000	played the demo. I liked it, but
11710000	11712000	I just spent $120 on
11712000	11714000	games this week, so I won't be picking up Forza
11714000	11716000	anytime soon, but I'm interested in it. Forza's
11716000	11718000	pretty good for what it's worth on
11718000	11720000	the 360, but in terms of actually,
11720000	11722000	like, for a hardcore game, you know, for
11722000	11724000	a hardcore racing gamer
11724000	11726000	who wants to, like, plug in their Logitech
11726000	11728000	G27 in there, which is not
11728000	11730000	even possible because it only supports PC
11730000	11732000	and PS3, I'm only,
11732000	11734000	you know, I'm basically, like,
11734000	11736000	forced to buy their,
11736000	11738000	like, you know, their bullshit
11738000	11740000	wireless wheel that
11740000	11742000	is just like, it's just like a yoke
11742000	11744000	shaped thing that just,
11744000	11746000	you could just, like, hold it up and just
11746000	11748000	stare, and it basically does it for you,
11748000	11750000	but it's not cutting it, because it's
11750000	11752000	like, I want to have that feel
11752000	11754000	and the shock of actually, um,
11754000	11756000	driving a car, shifting the
11756000	11758000	gears, and so
11758000	11760000	forth. Then go out and drive a car.
11760000	11762000	Well, drive a car
11762000	11764000	at high speeds without getting pulled over,
11764000	11766000	sure, sure.
11766000	11768000	Sure, buddy. It's worth a shot.
11768000	11770000	Go to Montana, ain't no one care out there.
11770000	11772000	Alright, Saku, I gotta let you go so we
11772000	11774000	can wrap up the show, maybe get one more call, alright?
11774000	11776000	Alright. Take care. Have a good one.
11776000	11778000	Bye, you too.
11778000	11780000	Alright, 1877 Game OLR, our
11780000	11782000	username on Skype is OrangeLaunchRadio. I
11782000	11784000	suppose we have time for one more
11784000	11786000	call, but I want to do some more of these tweets
11786000	11788000	here real quick, and then I'll let
11788000	11790000	Loki do last minute stories. Uh, TigerClaw
11790000	11792000	is sending us a couple tweets. I remember
11792000	11794000	reading about this one, and for some reason, they
11794000	11796000	make our show roll, but getting it out there,
11796000	11798000	what, uh, TigerClaw linked us to on
11798000	11800000	GamePolitics.com. Capcom
11800000	11802000	can no longer make new Tatsunoko
11802000	11804000	games. If you do not own
11804000	11806000	the Tatsunoko versus Capcom game,
11806000	11808000	uh, you better hurry up and find
11808000	11810000	it in a bargain bin somewhere, because Capcom
11810000	11812000	no longer holds the rights
11812000	11814000	to publish Tatsunoko games.
11814000	11816000	That was a limited deal, so,
11816000	11818000	uh, if you're hoping-
11818000	11820000	I have mine.
11820000	11822000	If you're hoping for a part two,
11822000	11824000	keep right on hoping.
11824000	11826000	This is really interesting. TigerClaw
11826000	11828000	linked into another story on, uh,
11828000	11830000	uh, Twitter.
11830000	11832000	I almost said Skype.
11832000	11834000	He didn't link on Skype, he linked on Twitter.
11834000	11836000	Foxconn rumored to be planning
11836000	11838000	US plants?
11838000	11840000	Isn't Foxconn that company in China
11840000	11842000	that all those controversial stories-
11842000	11844000	Is this a Goodwill thing, or, or
11844000	11846000	what is this? But, yeah.
11846000	11848000	Apparently, uh, they are evaluating Detroit
11848000	11850000	and LA for new operations.
11850000	11852000	Um, this is, uh-
11852000	11854000	Is there outsourcing here? Are we cheaper
11854000	11856000	labor? I- Hold on, I'll get back
11856000	11858000	to the story in a minute, but we got one more,
11858000	11860000	one more call coming in. I'll take this call, and then we'll go back to the story.
11860000	11862000	Hi, you're on Orange Honest Radio. Who's this?
11862000	11864000	Hey, this is Act Deft.
11864000	11866000	Act Deft? What's on your mind, buddy?
11866000	11868000	Well, I want to talk about
11868000	11870000	Forza Horizon 2.
11870000	11872000	Something that Zaku said.
11872000	11874000	Uh-oh. Alright, what'd you want to say in response
11874000	11876000	to what Zaku said?
11876000	11878000	Uh, he says, uh, Forza
11878000	11880000	isn't, or, Forza Horizon
11880000	11882000	isn't made for, uh,
11882000	11884000	well, playing with, playing
11884000	11886000	it with a, with a real controller,
11886000	11888000	er, racing controller. Mm-hmm.
11888000	11890000	And he's pretty wrong on that.
11890000	11892000	He's wrong? You're calling him out?
11892000	11894000	Why is he wrong?
11894000	11896000	Well, basically, uh, one of the, one of my
11896000	11898000	friends I play, uh, Forza,
11898000	11900000	uh, frequently with,
11900000	11902000	he has a fantastic controller,
11902000	11904000	and those controllers are, like, really
11904000	11906000	expensive, uh,
11906000	11908000	they have a lot of, uh, stuff
11908000	11910000	that, that makes it, makes
11910000	11912000	it feel like a li-, uh, you're driving
11912000	11914000	a real car, so,
11914000	11916000	uh, basically, you can,
11916000	11918000	uh, play, uh, play,
11918000	11920000	sorry, or, uh,
11920000	11922000	play with a real controller,
11922000	11924000	a good controller, uh, even though
11924000	11926000	it, it does feel different,
11926000	11928000	from, uh, even from Forza
11928000	11930000	4, but
11930000	11932000	you can still play it.
11932000	11934000	Now, Zaku in chat is, is clarifying,
11934000	11936000	I didn't bash Forza Horizon,
11936000	11938000	Forza 4 sucked ass on the 360
11938000	11940000	wireless steering wheel. Well, that's...
11942000	11944000	Well, that's different. I, I, I don't know
11944000	11946000	about the, the 360 controller,
11946000	11948000	but you can play. Yeah, Forza Horizon,
11948000	11950000	the demo played alright to me. I liked
11950000	11952000	that it, it was really stupid
11952000	11954000	proof, like, the demo was really stupid
11954000	11956000	proof, like, I played on Easy, and it was like,
11956000	11958000	here, let me break the car
11958000	11960000	for you. It's like having a driving instructor
11960000	11962000	sitting right next to you. I'm like, oh,
11962000	11964000	this is what I needed to be able to play Forza,
11964000	11966000	this is great. I'm totally,
11966000	11968000	I am being totally honest.
11968000	11970000	Well, uh, I have played,
11970000	11972000	uh, since Forza 2, and I,
11972000	11974000	and I loved it because
11974000	11976000	it's so easy to pretty much pick
11976000	11978000	up and play, even though, uh,
11978000	11980000	it does, uh, get harder on
11980000	11982000	later races for the
11982000	11984000	difficulty. Sure. It's pretty much
11984000	11986000	easy to play because you have
11986000	11988000	so much things, uh, that help
11988000	11990000	the, the driver, the
11990000	11992000	player, that
11992000	11994000	you can much, uh, pretty,
11994000	11996000	uh, pretty much screw up a race and
11996000	11998000	even though, uh,
11998000	12000000	the game will help you to correct
12000000	12002000	that and be a better player.
12002000	12004000	So, you, you give,
12004000	12006000	uh, Forza Horizon your stamp of approval
12006000	12008000	as well. I know I saw Bobby gave it a good review on
12008000	12010000	the site. Did you give it a good review too?
12010000	12012000	Yeah, I pretty much
12012000	12014000	gave, uh, the same points as
12014000	12016000	Bobby, even though, uh,
12016000	12018000	the difficulty in Forza Horizon can be
12018000	12020000	pretty unforgiving,
12020000	12022000	but it's still a great game.
12022000	12024000	Uh, even single player or
12024000	12026000	multiplayer, it's really good.
12026000	12028000	Alright. And, uh, it looks like they
12028000	12030000	just want to clarify one more thing. Not bashing the
12030000	12032000	game, says Black Wolf. He's bashing Microsoft's
12032000	12034000	controller standards.
12034000	12036000	No, I know. I know, but
12036000	12038000	like I said, if you have a good controller,
12038000	12040000	it will work. Yeah, 360 does have some,
12040000	12042000	some, uh, that controller does leave some things
12042000	12044000	to be desired, especially when it comes to that D-pad.
12044000	12046000	Alright, act deft. I'm going to let you go
12046000	12048000	so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much, buddy. Okay?
12048000	12050000	Thank you. Alright, take care.
12050000	12052000	Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
12052000	12054000	I'm going to close it up because we are running a little
12054000	12056000	long. I want to finish up Twitter and
12056000	12058000	then I'll let, uh, uh, Loki do any last
12058000	12060000	minute stories or Jamie. Um,
12060000	12062000	uh, that Foxconn story, let's see,
12062000	12064000	it's a Digitimes report saying that
12064000	12066000	Foxconn Electronics plans to set up
12066000	12068000	manufacturing plants in the US, looking
12068000	12070000	at Detroit and Los Angeles.
12070000	12072000	Uh, market watchers are the source of
12072000	12074000	the news. Uh, these facilities
12074000	12076000	would be expected to handle LCD
12076000	12078000	TV manufacturing. It's a
12078000	12080000	simpler and more automated process.
12080000	12082000	So, um,
12082000	12084000	It requires a lot less suicide.
12084000	12086000	Stop it.
12086000	12088000	Take that with a gigantic grain of
12088000	12090000	salt, but there you go.
12090000	12092000	Um, one other tweet I want to read
12092000	12094000	here is from Spazinator PSN on
12094000	12096000	Twitter. Sky, I'm challenging
12096000	12098000	to top some of my high
12098000	12100000	scores in Game Room.
12100000	12102000	Yes, I said Game Room.
12102000	12104000	What? What's that? We're going to party like it's 2010.
12104000	12106000	Woo! What's a Game Room?
12106000	12108000	He's talking about Microsoft Game Room.
12108000	12110000	You know, I haven't touched Game Room in a while
12110000	12112000	and I should. I'm
12112000	12114000	going to go back and, and
12114000	12116000	I'll go back and, you know, I did spend money
12116000	12118000	on a lot of those games and a lot more
12118000	12120000	than I really should be admitting. So I do
12120000	12122000	need to go back and show Spazinator
12122000	12124000	how it's done. So, uh,
12124000	12126000	fine. Challenge accepted.
12126000	12128000	Probably be able to set some high scores because
12128000	12130000	no one plays it anymore. Challenge accepted!
12130000	12132000	Loki, any last
12132000	12134000	minute stories? Uh, just a couple.
12134000	12136000	There was a comment about
12136000	12138000	Minecraft. They
12138000	12140000	were, um, basically saying that
12140000	12142000	the future of Minecraft is
12142000	12144000	the consumer. And the reason that is
12144000	12146000	is because one of the things that they're working on is
12146000	12148000	the whole new mod
12148000	12150000	interface that
12150000	12152000	they're going to allow people to be able to
12152000	12154000	mod Minecraft a lot easier.
12154000	12156000	Because right now it's a little bit difficult. You kind
12156000	12158000	of have to replace files in the jar file
12158000	12160000	and stuff like that and it's just not
12160000	12162000	user friendly. But they are
12162000	12164000	working on new framework that's going to allow
12164000	12166000	the creating and installing of mods to
12166000	12168000	be easier and also, um,
12168000	12170000	releasing an official editing suite.
12170000	12172000	Also, they're thinking about
12172000	12174000	hosting their own private servers so that they
12174000	12176000	can have groups of people to build
12176000	12178000	their own persistent worlds and
12178000	12180000	experiment.
12180000	12182000	So that's kind of neat.
12182000	12184000	And then there was another comment.
12184000	12186000	Ubisoft wants to get
12186000	12188000	their full retail
12188000	12190000	games onto the Wii
12190000	12192000	U eShop
12192000	12194000	as soon as possible.
12194000	12196000	I can understand why because they
12196000	12198000	had a good portion of the games for the
12198000	12200000	Vita launch and I bet a lot of those sold digitally.
12200000	12202000	Yeah, when there's nothing
12202000	12204000	else to buy, your games look pretty appealing.
12204000	12206000	They have a lot of games.
12206000	12208000	Push button, get game.
12208000	12210000	You never even have to hand anybody money.
12210000	12212000	Of course, the problem with downloading the games
12212000	12214000	is remember you need to have
12214000	12216000	storage space which, uh,
12216000	12218000	you know, really, you're only going to be able to
12218000	12220000	get about one or two games on the
12220000	12222000	premium
12222000	12224000	model there. You're going to need an external hard drive
12224000	12226000	and it's
12226000	12228000	an extra step. I understand it's not
12228000	12230000	necessarily an expensive step but
12230000	12232000	it's still an extra step to have
12232000	12234000	a hard drive to
12234000	12236000	put those games
12236000	12238000	on.
12238000	12240000	That's it.
12240000	12242000	Alright. Well that does it.
12242000	12244000	It's almost a three and a half hour show
12244000	12246000	tonight. Well it helps that we
12246000	12248000	actually get to play the break tonight so
12248000	12250000	it helps give more
12250000	12252000	content on the podcast and
12252000	12254000	something for the worker bees who listen to our show on
12254000	12256000	Mondays and Tuesdays and throughout the week.
12256000	12258000	Something to listen to. I really want to
12258000	12260000	thank you all for tuning in tonight. I want to
12260000	12262000	thank Eddie for coming on the show and staying
12262000	12264000	for 45 minutes, close to
12264000	12266000	much more than the 15 to 20
12266000	12268000	I told him it would be. So big thanks to him
12268000	12270000	for coming out tonight. BimaniStyle.com
12270000	12272000	I want to thank Jen
12272000	12274000	from Girl Gamer Vogue for doing
12274000	12276000	that interview with DJ Rama S as well. It was great
12276000	12278000	to meet her through Rama
12278000	12280000	and I want to thank my
12280000	12282000	co-hosts for being here tonight too.
12282000	12284000	You're welcome.
12284000	12286000	I want to thank myself for being
12286000	12288000	here. Thank you Rob. Thank you
12288000	12290000	Rob because if it weren't for you I wouldn't be
12290000	12292000	here tonight. I wasn't even
12292000	12294000	supposed to be here today.
12294000	12296000	And I want to thank the listeners for showing
12296000	12298000	up through apparently seven
12298000	12300000	drops of the feed. They stayed with
12300000	12302000	the show tonight. I know right.
12302000	12304000	We got to figure out what the hell's. And like
12304000	12306000	Alan's not here so there's no bandwidth
12306000	12308000	coming out of the office tonight. No I don't think it's us
12308000	12310000	because I'm not getting disconnected
12310000	12312000	from chat so.
12312000	12314000	Something's up. I'm not running anything either so.
12314000	12316000	But anyway thank you
12316000	12318000	guys again for your support and if you got to the
12318000	12320000	whole end of the show you're listening on the podcast
12320000	12322000	you know what thank you too for listening to all
12322000	12324000	three and a half hours of it. You guys rock.
12324000	12326000	Of course I could be really evil and vindictive and put
12326000	12328000	the pass phrase like right here at the very very end so
12328000	12330000	people have to like. Oh just kidding.
12330000	12332000	Boogers. No it's not. Don't listen. It's not it.
12332000	12334000	Alright. Anyhow
12334000	12336000	let's go around and get everybody's
12336000	12338000	final thought. DarkSakura what's your final thought
12338000	12340000	tonight? I just got wind a certain bit
12340000	12342000	of news that I
12342000	12344000	actually think is super cool.
12344000	12346000	Have you ever heard of the company
12346000	12348000	Bob's Red Mill?
12348000	12350000	It makes like grains and cereals
12350000	12352000	and gluten free stuff and.
12352000	12354000	No but okay. You can find it like in the health
12354000	12356000	section that type of thing. Well
12356000	12358000	the owner actually just handed over the company
12358000	12360000	to the employees to make it employee
12360000	12362000	stock owned. Oh.
12362000	12364000	Meaning that all of
12364000	12366000	the stock
12366000	12368000	increases go directly into their retirement
12368000	12370000	funds. Nice. As a trust they can
12370000	12372000	also borrow from which I wish more
12372000	12374000	companies would be like that you know to
12374000	12376000	work for the benefit of their employees.
12376000	12378000	So just saying not all rich
12378000	12380000	people are assholes I guess.
12380000	12382000	Saying. Loki your final thought
12382000	12384000	tonight. My car sucks.
12384000	12386000	Hopefully I get a new car though.
12386000	12388000	Because we're looking at new cars now. Or
12388000	12390000	new to me cars.
12390000	12392000	Not necessarily new cars.
12392000	12394000	Less old.
12394000	12396000	Not necessarily.
12396000	12398000	Less mileage hopefully.
12398000	12400000	I want to thank everybody for listening
12400000	12402000	to the show tonight and sticking with it
12402000	12404000	and remember if you like our show just

12432000	12434000	Alright stop. Alright.
12434000	12436000	That does it. My final thought.
12436000	12438000	I'm gonna go with an old classic.
12438000	12440000	My final thought tonight.
