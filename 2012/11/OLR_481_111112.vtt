Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
Tonight, November 11th, 2012, Nintendo reveals some more details about the Wii U

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
THQ delays games as stocks fall, and could the Kinect soon police your content licenses?

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 481 for this November the 11th of 2012

00:45.000 --> 00:51.000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and all that good stuff

00:52.000 --> 00:55.000
With my co-hosts, first off, the one, the only, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Hi

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
How are you, Jamie Summers?

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
Um, I'm okay

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Your knitting rainbow things over here are crocheting

01:01.000 --> 01:06.000
I'm crocheting the gayest scarf ever, all it needs is KY jelly and it'll be gayer

01:06.000 --> 01:12.000
Are you planning in advance of Gay Pride Month? Are you planning to sell these?

01:12.000 --> 01:19.000
No, this is actually, it's a scheme that I've had for a while and I thought was kind of a different bit of yarn

01:20.000 --> 01:24.000
But, um, I've been taking orders for scrap scarves

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
Basically I'm working through all of my old cheap yarn

01:27.000 --> 01:31.000
And this was actually a fairly cheap scheme, I just didn't realize that it was going to crochet up so pretty

01:31.000 --> 01:40.000
So I'm actually going to go back and buy more of them to make people scarves and things for various pride events and whatnots

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
Or like the holidays? Because, you know, everybody likes a homemade holiday gift, I do

01:44.000 --> 01:50.000
Well, that's actually why I texted you a while back and asked if you or Alan were allergic to wool

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
Yay! Awesome

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
Because I'm broke

01:53.000 --> 01:58.000
Well, also say hello to somebody that I'm sure is making lots of homemade gifts for the holiday, Techmaster Loki

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
Um, no, I'm not

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
You're not going to bake cookies for everybody for the holidays?

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
No, I don't do much baking

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Well, how have you-

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
Let's order some cookies from Colorado

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
Right? How have you been doing, Loki?

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
Oh, fantastic with my car not working and everything

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
Oh, yeah, sorry to hear about that

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
Yeah, it was the Ford we expect

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
Fix or repair daily, right?

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
Yeah

02:21.000 --> 02:26.000
Well, it's not just the three of us on the show every week, it's you guys joining us live in our chat room

02:26.000 --> 02:30.000
If you want to join us in the chat room, head on over to live.vognetwork.com

02:30.000 --> 02:37.000
And if you're listening on the podcast feed, just a reminder, we do tape live every Sunday night at about 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern

02:37.000 --> 02:43.000
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network or vognetwork.com

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
And again, our chat room live.vognetwork.com

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
You know, there is another thing that Ford can stand for

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
What?

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
Found on Road Dead

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
Yeah, I've heard that one too

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
From a parking lot

02:54.000 --> 02:55.000
But it doesn't work

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Yeah

02:57.000 --> 03:02.000
Alright, so we're going to get into some news and what we've been playing this week

03:02.000 --> 03:05.000
And some big interviews tonight that I will talk about in just a moment

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
But I do want to start off the show first because we have some interviews tonight

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
I know we might have a few new listeners because of that

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
I want to say hello, welcome to the show

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
Reintroduce ourselves a little bit

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
We try to do that once every few months or so for those folks that are new to Orange Lounge Radio

03:18.000 --> 03:20.000
But if you are new to Orange Lounge Radio, hello

03:20.000 --> 03:26.000
We're a show, we created this show, myself, Dark Soccer and Loki all created this show

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
Ten years ago, over ten years ago

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
We all met playing a little game you might have heard of in the arcades

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
Stomping arrows called Dance Dance Revolution

03:35.000 --> 03:39.000
And we used to play that pretty aggressively here in the south

03:39.000 --> 03:41.000
I don't know what other words you used to describe it

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
We were angry DDR players

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Damn these arrows, damn them

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
And birthday parties

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
At Roseville Golf Land where we sat on the floor in front of the fourth mix and ate cake

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
That was my birthday

03:53.000 --> 03:57.000
I still remember one of the first dream games we ever had on Orange Lounge Radio

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Was inspired by Golf Land trips

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
You called it birthday party sniper

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Something like that

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
Yeah, Roseville Golf Land is an interesting place

04:06.000 --> 04:09.000
It still is today, interesting is a good word to describe it

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
Like people who pick their nose and eat it

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
It's interesting

04:12.000 --> 04:16.000
I went not too long ago and wore myself out by DDR

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
I was like, I got old

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
I know right

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
But anyway, ten years ago we all met playing DDR

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
And we were really into that scene

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
It wasn't just DDR

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
It was a lot of the imports coming from Japan

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
We used to have the Bamani parties here locally

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
The sacramentals having the Bamani parties

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
Where we'd bust out the Beatmania 5 key, the Beatmania 2DX

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Guitar freaks

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
I remember I couldn't get that name because a Catholic organization took it

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Really?

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Yeah

04:42.000 --> 04:43.000
I forgot about that

04:43.000 --> 04:44.000
Well anyway

04:44.000 --> 04:47.000
So we decided to make this little show

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
Because I have some prior radio experience dating back to college

04:51.000 --> 04:54.000
And another show I was on many years ago called Undersedation Live

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
And myself, Dark Soccer, and Loki after a long day at the arcade

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
No matter what we were playing at the time

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
Whether it be DDR, Initial D, or something like that

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
We used to go to a little restaurant that was in the parking lot

05:06.000 --> 05:09.000
And we'd just kind of sit around, order things that were bad for us

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Like mozzarella sticks

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
And just talk some shit about video games

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
And what was going on

05:14.000 --> 05:18.000
And so that was really the type of thing we wanted to bring here to the internets

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Is this giant virtual table

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
Where we're all sitting on one side of it here in the studio

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Talking our stuff

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
And then you guys kind of make up the rest of that table

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
Sitting here with us in the chat room

05:27.000 --> 05:29.000
And via the Skype line and so forth

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Just talking some good stuff about video games

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
And just having fun with it

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
Because that's what video games are all about

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Fun and

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Talking smack about stupid people

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
DDR and that whole thing and Beatmania

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Bimani in general

05:40.000 --> 05:42.000
Music games was really all about community

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
So segueing a little bit into

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
One of the interviews we're going to have tonight

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
Is with our buddy Eddie

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
He runs a website you might have heard of

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
If you've played music games before

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
It's called BimaniStyle.com

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
And that site's been around a very long time

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
In fact I think it's older than us

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
By a few months

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
So we're going to talk to Eddie tonight

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
About community

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Because he has

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
Especially now that DDR Freak is sunsetted

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
It's no more

06:07.000 --> 06:12.000
He probably has the largest music game community that's out there

06:12.000 --> 06:14.000
So I want to talk to him just kind of about

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
The past

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
The future

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
And so forth

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
And have some fun commentary with him on that

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
So we'll be talking to him in about 15 minutes or so

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Also on tonight's show

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
We have another interview

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
A taped interview we're going to play tonight during our break

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Where the music usually is

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
This is something that DJ Rama S did for us

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
And I'll talk more about this

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
This whole

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
That we have other people doing interviews

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
I'll talk more about that later

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
But this is an exciting interview

06:40.000 --> 06:41.000
It's Jen

06:41.000 --> 06:44.000
From a website called Girl Gamer Vogue

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
GG Vogue.com

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
She's going to talk about

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
Her girl gaming community

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
In the tri-state area back east

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
And why she made it

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
And what it's all about

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
So we're going to have that a little later on in the show

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Probably closer to about 8 o'clock

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
Before we get to the interviews and so forth

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
We're going to get into our gaming weeks

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
But I want to talk

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
A little bit here

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
At the top of the show about something personal

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Because we did talk about

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
The shows are all about community

07:08.000 --> 07:12.000
And over these 10 years that we've been doing this show

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
We have a lot of the same people that show up in our chat room week after week

07:16.000 --> 07:19.000
And they like to hear the little insights that are going on in our personal lives

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
Both the good and the bad

07:21.000 --> 07:23.000
And I have to share something with you guys tonight

07:23.000 --> 07:25.000
That kind of happened

07:25.000 --> 07:26.000
I just want to get off my chest

07:26.000 --> 07:28.000
Because the weird thing about this is

07:28.000 --> 07:30.000
And I'm going to apologize to Jamie in advance for this

07:30.000 --> 07:32.000
Because a lot of this is very deja vu

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
To a story that she told

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
Not even three weeks ago

07:36.000 --> 07:37.000
Perfectly okay

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Just forgive me if I get sniffy

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
It's fine

07:39.000 --> 07:41.000
The whole thing's just weird

07:41.000 --> 07:43.000
So you guys can probably guess where I'm going with this

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
If I'm referencing that

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
As many of you know

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
I moved in with my boyfriend Allen

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
About, gosh it was probably about

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
Almost two years ago now

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
And we

07:55.000 --> 07:56.000
Actually more like a year and a half

07:56.000 --> 07:57.000
But anyway

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
He brought with him two cats that he's had for a long time

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
Since 2000 I think

08:02.000 --> 08:05.000
I think he got them around October of 2000

08:05.000 --> 08:07.000
And they were about four or six months old at the time

08:07.000 --> 08:08.000
Probably fudging some of these details

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
But I wasn't around back then

08:09.000 --> 08:11.000
And their names are

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Maruko and Sanrio

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
And Maruko was a male black cat

08:15.000 --> 08:17.000
And Sanrio's a tan cat

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
Female

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
And you know I've grown very close to these cats as well

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
And you've probably heard them referenced on the show sometimes

08:23.000 --> 08:25.000
In fact it was really weird

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Just the other day

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
I was listening to a playback

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
Yes I do listen to OLR once in a while

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
It's a really good way to kind of be a

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
Critic of yourself

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
I was listening to the show a couple weeks ago

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
And I believe Maruko came out

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Because I heard Jamie like

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
Oh hey Maruko like you were petting him

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
They were very unlike Shirmi

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
Where they don't come out during the shows

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Because they're very shy

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
And they don't like people

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
She was like already there you can't move her

08:51.000 --> 08:53.000
This is my couch

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
You don't like it get out

08:55.000 --> 08:59.000
Maruko always pranced around with his tail in the air

08:59.000 --> 09:01.000
So I always called him Mr. Priss

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
But he was also very vocal

09:03.000 --> 09:05.000
And was a really fun cat

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
And I really have grown to appreciate Maruko

09:07.000 --> 09:09.000
And he loves Sanrio's food

09:09.000 --> 09:11.000
No doubt

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
You can sadly guess where this is going

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
We got blindsided a little bit

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
The past couple days

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Maruko started showing some really bad symptoms

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
On Thursday and Friday

09:21.000 --> 09:23.000
He just wasn't himself

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
I can't even describe it

09:25.000 --> 09:27.000
His meows were different

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
He was always a very vocal cat

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
The way he was breathing was very different as well

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
So I told Alan well of course let's go see the vet

09:33.000 --> 09:35.000
Right away

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
We got to the vet's office pretty much thinking

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
Oh you know we just need to get some medication

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
He'll be alright whatever

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
But we get the x-rays back and the news is really bad

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
He had a lot of fluid in his body

09:45.000 --> 09:47.000
In places it shouldn't be

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
Basically so much around his lung

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
That it was basically pushing on his lung

09:51.000 --> 09:53.000
And he was having a hard time breathing

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
That was causing it

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
Unfortunately

09:57.000 --> 09:59.000
A tough decision had to be made

09:59.000 --> 10:01.000
And we put him down yesterday

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
And it was

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
What can I say?

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
It was devastating

10:07.000 --> 10:09.000
Just the shock of it all

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Just the fact that this came out

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Of literally nowhere

10:13.000 --> 10:15.000
Even though this thing that he'd been developing

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Apparently was silently developing for years

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
But even if we had

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
The thousands of dollars to pursue

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
A diagnosis and figure out

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
What was causing it

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
The veterinarian made it pretty clear that

10:27.000 --> 10:29.000
It's probably heart failure

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
It's probably cancer

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
I have another friend that just lost a cat to FIP

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Not that long ago

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
So it's just like

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
It's tough

10:39.000 --> 10:41.000
With Shermy she was wheezing

10:41.000 --> 10:43.000
When we got back from Disneyland

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
And then I wrapped her up in hot towels

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
For a few days

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
And she perked right back up

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
And then suddenly she just

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
Keeled over

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
But the symptoms sound very serious

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
And it's just like

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
It's just like

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
But the symptoms sound very serious

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
She was having respiratory issues

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
Since some folks in the chat room

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
Are asking at live.vognetwork.com

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
The Maruko was 12 and a half

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
So a little old

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
In kitty ears

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
For an indoor cat

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
Maybe not super old

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
But definitely old enough

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
For complications to start coming in

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
So I don't know what else to say

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
I just want to get that off my chest

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
So that way if I'm gonna sniffle up

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
And not while we're trying to interview somebody

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Hi Eddie how are you?

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
He was a very good kitty

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
And he sat in my lap a couple times

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
Well you used to cat sit

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
So I know you were one of the first people I called in the parking lot

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
And I was like

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
I'm driving

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
I was actually literally

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
This was at what Florin Mall used to be

11:47.000 --> 11:49.000
If you want to know where I was

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
And I was having the thing to pull out

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Into the street when you called

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
And I was trying to be considerate

11:55.000 --> 11:57.000
And I was like okay fine

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
And then it went on to FaceTime

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
I was like oh shit have I been on FaceTime this entire time

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
And turn around and pull in

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
And I had my friend with me

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
And then I just did a circle in the parking lot

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Anyway I want to try and move on

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
I don't want to dwell on this too much

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
But I do want to address

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
Some of the comments that are in chatroom

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
At live.vognetwork.com

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Lots of condolences and thank you very much

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
I will pass those along to Alan as well

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
I was only fortunate enough to know Maruko for about 3 years

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
But he did live for 12 and a half

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Tigerclaw says my condolences

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Losing a pet is the hardest thing a person could ever go through

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
It is definitely one of the worst

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Tigerclaw asks how about Sanrio

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
How is she health wise

12:35.000 --> 12:37.000
Obviously the plan is

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
When we have money

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Because yesterday set us back a little bit

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
But when we have some money we do want to go in and get her checked

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
And make sure she didn't contract the same virus

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
That's one of the first things we want to try and rule out

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
She's doing okay

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
She's hard to read right now

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
I think she knows something's up

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
She's kind of looking around

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
Acting a little differently

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
I think she knows something's missing

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
But that's to be expected

13:01.000 --> 13:03.000
But she still has some of her playfulness

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
I took a really cute video earlier today

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
Of her playing with a string

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
So you know

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
We'll see

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
We'll try to get her in as soon as we can

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
When we can financially

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Take care of it

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Going to some other comments in our chatroom

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
I like this from Breakman it's very good

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Cats and dogs are such a great part of our life

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
But they are so fragile

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
And their time with us is far too short

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Ain't that the truth

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
Gamegrew says I'm sorry about your cat

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
I've lost my last cat a few months ago

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
It's tough

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
And especially

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
The suddenness of it all

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Is tough

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
I want to move on

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
How do we escape from reality

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
By playing video games

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Well not in my case I drank and cried

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
For a night

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
We haven't quite had that phase

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Yet and I'm hoping we'll be alright

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
But if we have to have that we will

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Sometimes it doesn't hit you

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
For a little while

14:01.000 --> 14:03.000
Let's talk about video games and some of the other

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
Distractions and things that are better

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
And again if you do want to join us in our chatroom

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
Live.vognetwork.com is the place

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
To be

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
DarkSagra why don't you start us off tonight

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
I have a very happy announcement of something

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
That I've played

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Mass Effect 3

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
What a shock

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
The ghost patch

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
Is what we're calling it

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Because I just decided on a whim

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
To check on it after a fresh boot

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
And it patched something

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
And I'm like really?

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
And so I loaded it and of course it rewrote

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
My hack file which is fine

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
And I

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
I loaded it up

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
And lo and behold I had zero

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Problems none of the lag none of any of that

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
So I was

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Quite happily surprised

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
And I

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
Even checked it

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
You know with other people

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
I you know did a bunch of

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
Other stuff to make sure it wasn't just a

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
A

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
You know

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
What's the word I'm thinking of?

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
Not a whim

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
But just a one off

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
Thing and

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
It kept working and so I was like

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
Everyone get a multiplayer right now

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
So I played for a while with

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Shane and Tim

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
And then I played again

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
With Shane and

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Tim and Spike the other day

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
And with my friend George

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
And everything was fine I still kind of suck at it

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
But I'm getting better and

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
Got a few levels in did the N7

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Challenge thing

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Fun so you got a banner

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
And I wore my N7 shirt

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
That day and

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
I also went in just to

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
See if it was like a completely new patch

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
So I tried to um to hack my game

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Again and well more like

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
Hex edit it so that I could get the console to

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
Unlock and the same it's at

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
The same sector it still works so

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
But everyone if you're trying to do

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
The hex edit based on what's on

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
The mass effect wiki it's

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
Not F4 for the last two

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
Numbers it's F3 just letting

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
You know I

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
Did that on screw that up no I did it

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
Because there's no F4 I did

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
I did the F3 on a win because I found the

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Same sector and it worked so

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
They have it on there wrong

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
So um as

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
I just said Tigerclaw um probably

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Didn't hear but I can play online again

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
And I went back in on my DLC

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Works and so that means I'm good

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
To go for Omega but we're calling

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
It the ghost patch because

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
They didn't announce anything

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
They didn't even acknowledge that there

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Was a problem the only acknowledgement

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
That I got was from

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
Some guy

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
In customer service

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Who actually worked with me for a long time

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
And he said yeah we're noticing that there's

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
A problem here we just can't say anything else about it

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Right now oh really

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
I can't say

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
No comment I can't

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
Say anything on that he was

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
He did more for me than the other people

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
Did but

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
It did give me a nice little

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
30%

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
Off code which I'm going to use for the Omega

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
DLC

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
So I'm very happy

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
And um I played

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
Through Mass Effect 2 I actually did

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Touch WoW long enough to

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
Log out while I was trying to make

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
Plans with you to go see Silent Hill

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
I completely forgot that I was logged in and

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Talking to you

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Did you guys go see Silent Hill? No we still haven't made it out

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
To see it

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
You need to do that

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
BlackWolf has a smart ass comment

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
In our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
In response to your fact

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
That the information on the wiki is wrong

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
He says if only it was a wiki

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
And everyone could edit it

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
That means I have to log in for an account on it and I don't

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
Fucking feel like it

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
That means I have to do work

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
Well the other thing

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
And I think I mentioned it last week is now that I have a job

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
Like a real job

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
That's going to pay me some good money

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
Hooray for money

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
That I kind of haven't had much

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Garris

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
I haven't had a whole bunch of time

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
To really do much except

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
That the good thing about my job is that since I don't usually have to

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
Be in until 9 in the morning

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
I can stay up till midnight and sleep in

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
And so I can actually

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
Because who really feels like

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
Waking up early in the morning and gaming

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
Before work? Seriously?

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
Gaming is something you stay up all night

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
And do. You play games in the morning, Logie?

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
I would if I didn't have to get

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
The baby up

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
I like to stay up all night

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
I don't have children, that's awesome

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
I've stayed up all night and done that still

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
He's not really a baby anymore either

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
He's more of a toddler

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
Just saying

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
At any rate

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
At any rate

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
My schedule has actually been pretty perfect

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
For gaming except that

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
My work environment is so fast paced

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
And I don't get paid days off which makes me a little sad

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
But it's all good

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
That's my work

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
It's in a small office in a house

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
And I have so much freedom

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
For my scheduling and for things that need to happen

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
And I can wear socks

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
I ask permission to wear my fuzzy socks in the office

19:07.000 --> 19:09.000
And I can do it

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
It's great. Anyways

19:11.000 --> 19:13.000
My work allows me more game time

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
So I will be playing more stuff

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
Awesome. Logie, how was your gaming week?

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
I played Call of Duty Black Ops 2

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
Yes, I know it's not out yet

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
How's that gonna stop me?

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
When you work in games distribution

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
You can sometimes

19:27.000 --> 19:29.000
You know, do things early

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
Anyways, so, got the play

19:31.000 --> 19:33.000
Obviously haven't been playing any multiplayer

19:33.000 --> 19:35.000
On it, well, no

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
Internet multiplayer because the servers aren't up

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
And also you want to be careful

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
Because everyone, after the whole Halo leaking out a month

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
Early and stuff like that

19:43.000 --> 19:45.000
So

19:45.000 --> 19:47.000
Been playing mainly the single player campaign

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
And really that's kind of cool

19:49.000 --> 19:51.000
Because I haven't played a lot

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Of the single player campaigns

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
I played a bit of Modern Warfare 3 single player campaign

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
And totally hated it

19:57.000 --> 19:59.000
Because they were

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Really penalizing you with shooting your teammates

20:01.000 --> 20:03.000
Not that I'm trying to shoot my teammates

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
But everyone kind of blends in

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
When it's so chaotic and stuff

20:07.000 --> 20:09.000
And it seems like Black Ops 2 isn't so

20:09.000 --> 20:11.000
At least

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
I'm playing on a super easy difficulty too

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
Because I just really care about the story

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
I don't give a shit about the challenge

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
But

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
You know, I haven't had that problem

20:21.000 --> 20:23.000
Where, oh, you accidentally killed a teammate

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
Because, you know, he ran in front of you

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
When you're firing a missile or something like that

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
You know, so that's kind of cool

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
But the story is fucking awesome

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
It's just like, it's really action packed

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
And just, I really enjoy it

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
And that's saying a lot

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
Considering that a lot of times

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
People consider the, like, single player

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Campaign for these kind of games

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
To be kind of just a throw away

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
It's just, oh, well they have it on there

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Actually, the single player is pretty awesome

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
Like, and I actually want to check out

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
The first Black Ops game

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
Because I never played it

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
But, you know, obviously carrying on with the characters

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
That they have from the first game

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
But it just, like, for example

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
There's one scene, it kind of flips back and forth

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
Between the past and the future

21:06.000 --> 21:08.000
Warfare

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
So, the first kind of future warfare

21:10.000 --> 21:12.000
One that you're in, you're kind of swinging along

21:12.000 --> 21:14.000
This, it's like a mountainside

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Or something like that

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
And you're tethered to this other guy

21:18.000 --> 21:20.000
And you have these nanogloves that you can grip onto the rocks and stuff

21:20.000 --> 21:22.000
And they're scouting out this

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
This base that's, you know, kind of in a temple

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
Or something like that

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
And so, they put on their wingsuits

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
And they fly down there

21:30.000 --> 21:32.000
And just that sequence is so fucking awesome

21:32.000 --> 21:34.000
It's just, like, I saw them

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
It's like, this is so awesome

21:36.000 --> 21:38.000
Does it have, like, 80's metal playing in the background?

21:38.000 --> 21:40.000
No, there's no 80's metal playing

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
It's very, like, cinematic

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
Because, uh, Knight, was it Trent Reznor

21:45.000 --> 21:47.000
Oh, that's right!

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
It's just really awesome

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Like, you're flying down there

21:51.000 --> 21:53.000
And I know it's not really, like, a quick time thing and stuff

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
I mean, there are some quick time stuff in there

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
But it wasn't that big a deal

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
But, um, it was just really cool

21:59.000 --> 22:01.000
And then you get into this, like, secret thing under the base

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
And it's like, oh, it's this, you know, nanobot factory thing

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
That's pretty awesome

22:05.000 --> 22:07.000
And then there's also the one that you've seen in the trailer

22:07.000 --> 22:09.000
Where you're riding on a horseback

22:09.000 --> 22:11.000
And it's one of the flashback missions that you're on

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
But you're playing on a horseback

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Like, almost the whole mission

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
And it's awesome, because you're just

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
Blowing up tanks with a rocket launcher on the back of a horse

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
And there's, like, helicopters flying over

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
Wait, say that again?

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
Blowing up tanks

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
You're blowing up tanks on the back of a horse

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
You're holding a rocket launcher and riding a horse

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
I swear to God, that was a scene in Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
That was sort of a scene in the commercial

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
Except the girl had grenades

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
But it's just

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
It's so, like, chaotic and awesome

22:39.000 --> 22:41.000
It's a really

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
I love it, I love the campaign

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
And it really kind of makes me want to go back and try some of the other

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
Single player campaigns of the different games

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
But just for some reason, this, like, kind of

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
Near future combat stuff is just really

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
Cool, like, the storyline's actually

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
I think really well done

22:55.000 --> 22:57.000
So, um, definitely worth checking out

22:57.000 --> 22:59.000
I mean, even if you're kind of thinking twice about

22:59.000 --> 23:01.000
Eh, it's just another Modern Warfare shooter game

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
Check out the storyline

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
They actually did a pretty good job on it

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
So besides that, played a little bit more Minecraft

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
Been just trying to get, you know, plugins and stuff

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
To work correctly with each other

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
I'm working on finishing up the mob arena stuff

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
So I have this Magic Spells

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
Um, plugin that I added in there

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
But I didn't realize it had a dependent

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
Plugin with this vault thing that I had to install

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
In there, so I'm still trying to get that all worked out

23:23.000 --> 23:25.000
And get the permissions set correctly

23:25.000 --> 23:27.000
Still kind of new to the whole bucket plugin stuff

23:27.000 --> 23:29.000
Um, and then I noticed that

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
One of our other users

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
Hitstun had turned in the Mr. Freeze

23:33.000 --> 23:35.000
And had frozen the jungles

23:35.000 --> 23:37.000
Everybody chill

23:37.000 --> 23:39.000
Seriously

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
Wait a second, why can't I see off the roof of this

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
Mob arena I created

23:43.000 --> 23:45.000
What's going on here, is it just not drawing in

23:45.000 --> 23:47.000
I realize it's snow

23:47.000 --> 23:49.000
Leave it to Hitstun or somebody to bring

23:49.000 --> 23:51.000
The League of Super-Villains into the

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
It was an accident

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
He was working with World Edit

23:55.000 --> 23:57.000
It's always an accident

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
That's how villains get created

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
Hey, it was easy to fix

24:01.000 --> 24:03.000
Joker fell into that vat

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
This is what happens when you play God

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
And it was fixed

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
He was making a snow globe

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
In the nether

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
I don't know how that

24:13.000 --> 24:15.000
Got out onto everything else

24:15.000 --> 24:17.000
But there's snow in a bunch of the

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
Different chunks there

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
So I had to fix that

24:21.000 --> 24:23.000
I thought it was hilarious, there was snow in the jungle

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Yes, there was snow all over the jungle

24:25.000 --> 24:27.000
I was like, this is not right

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
I had to find the corners and then

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Welcome to the jungle, we got lots of snow

24:31.000 --> 24:33.000
So I fixed all that

24:33.000 --> 24:35.000
I tried playing a little bit of Curiosity

24:35.000 --> 24:37.000
But it wasn't working

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
So that was that

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
And Call of Duty Black Ops

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
Or not Black Ops, Modern Warfare 3

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
We've been playing multiplayer of that

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
And that's pretty fun

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
I actually played a little bit of multiplayer in Black Ops 2 as well

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
The split screen stuff

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
Actually the split screen stuff

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
Because I was bored, I decided to take on

24:55.000 --> 24:57.000
Nine AI characters that were the

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
Veteran difficulty, which is the hardest

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Because it's AI

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
And you figure out the weaknesses in their

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
Pathfinding and away you go

25:05.000 --> 25:07.000
So that was that

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
I forgot one other game I played

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
Very Solitaire

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
That's right because it was free, I played that too

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
It was actually fun

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
For a free game, better than Yaris

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
It was a good time killer

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
I actually had fun with it because I like card games

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
Yeah

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
It reminded me of Neopets

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
I wouldn't have minded paying a little bit of money for it

25:27.000 --> 25:29.000
But it was cute

25:29.000 --> 25:31.000
I used to play Pyramid Solitaire on Neopets all the time

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
That was a good tip Act F by the way last week

25:33.000 --> 25:35.000
Oh and the last thing, one of the things that they've been hyping up

25:35.000 --> 25:37.000
About Black Ops 2 is these whole

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
This kind of like strike force missions

25:39.000 --> 25:41.000
They fucking suck

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
I hate the strike force missions

25:43.000 --> 25:45.000
And the reason why is because they're on the multiplayer maps

25:45.000 --> 25:47.000
It's basically kind of like this strategy thing

25:47.000 --> 25:49.000
Where you get a bunch of different troops and stuff

25:49.000 --> 25:51.000
And you can kind of, okay go here defend this

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
Go here attack this

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
And you can jump into each of them

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
It's supposed to add this kind of strategy element to it

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
The problem is though

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
Is the controlling of that stuff is really terrible

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
And so you're telling your troops to go here

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
And then you're trying to select one soldier

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
And it's selecting all of them

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
It's pain in the ass

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
I found it more efficient for me to go into a soldier

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
And just do the mission myself

26:13.000 --> 26:15.000
So that's kind of the only

26:15.000 --> 26:17.000
Poopoo thing about Black Ops 2 right now

26:17.000 --> 26:19.000
Halo Man in our chat room

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
At live.vognetwork.com says

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
Today's headline, Loki loves a game

26:23.000 --> 26:25.000
The Mayans have been proven to be right

26:25.000 --> 26:27.000
Dude I love games all the time

26:27.000 --> 26:29.000
Grand Theft Auto

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
Hello

26:31.000 --> 26:33.000
By the way Halo 4 made me nauseous

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
If you're done with your gaming week

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000
I want to quickly talk about mine

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
I don't have a whole lot of time

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
Because we're running a little late for Eddie's interview

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
Because we got a late start tonight

26:43.000 --> 26:45.000
But I want to quickly talk about

26:45.000 --> 26:47.000
A couple games because I did play some new stuff this week

26:47.000 --> 26:49.000
One of them is Halo 4

26:49.000 --> 26:51.000
Yes, me

26:51.000 --> 26:53.000
Halo, uh huh, I bought it

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
Keep in mind

26:55.000 --> 26:57.000
I've been out of the Halo franchise for a little bit

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
I didn't buy ODST, I didn't buy Anniversary

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
I didn't buy Reach, the last Halo game I bought was Halo 3

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
And I didn't love Halo 3

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
Because I didn't have a lot of friends

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
That were online playing the multiplayer

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
And for me that's kind of where it's at in Halo

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
I don't get into the story mode too much

27:11.000 --> 27:13.000
So Halo 4

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
Is kind of a new boot to the series

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
Because it's a new developer

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
It's 343 Industries

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
I'm only through like the first two chapters

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
So I'm not going to try to speak with authority or anything

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
But I will say

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
It's interesting

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
I feel a little lost

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
Because I'm not as familiar with all the backstory

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
And so forth

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
But I can pick up enough of what's going on

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
That I'm not like hating it

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
And at the end of the day

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
The story is really about the relationship between

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
Master Chief and Cortana

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
Any review outlet that's talked about this game

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
Is going to tell you that

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
There's too much more to really get into the series

27:50.000 --> 27:52.000
But for me

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
It's always been multiplayer

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
Is where it's at

27:56.000 --> 27:58.000
And I've been having fun

27:58.000 --> 28:00.000
There's a group of about four of us that have been playing multiplayer online

28:00.000 --> 28:02.000
And we've been trying out all the modes

28:02.000 --> 28:04.000
You know, King of the Hill, Oddball

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
All the stuff you know from the old games

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Of course Slayer

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
But there's a couple fun new ones

28:10.000 --> 28:12.000
And I gotta say

28:12.000 --> 28:14.000
I had a great time playing Flood

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Which is one of the new game modes

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
Flood, some of you are the Spartans

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Like the normal guys

28:20.000 --> 28:22.000
But some of you become the Flood

28:22.000 --> 28:24.000
You become these like creatures that run really fast

28:24.000 --> 28:26.000
And have swords

28:26.000 --> 28:28.000
And basically it is a

28:28.000 --> 28:30.000
Kill the Spartans as fast as you can

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
And then once you kill a Spartan

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
They become a Flood

28:34.000 --> 28:36.000
So it's kind of one of those like devour

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
You know everybody as fast as you can

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
And convert them and whoever can survive the longest

28:40.000 --> 28:42.000
Ultimately wins

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
But for some random ass reason

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
The creatures make horsey noises

28:46.000 --> 28:48.000
Like they go

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
They make these noises like horses

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
When they're dying and stuff

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
It's the creepiest thing in the world

28:54.000 --> 28:56.000
And hilarious

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
So for a good time

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
Just add Flood

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
And then there was this other mode we played

29:02.000 --> 29:04.000
I think it was like Griffonball or something like that

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
Griffball

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
All the other ones have description

29:08.000 --> 29:10.000
And for Griffball it said

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
Just add awesome

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Something like that

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
So we go in this mode and all it is

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
Is you have the gigantic gravity hammers

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
You can either have a hammer

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
Or a sword

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
And it's just a game of

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Get the ball into the goal

29:26.000 --> 29:28.000
But you have these giant hammers

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
That you're either knocking the ball around with

29:30.000 --> 29:32.000
Or the other players

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
And so that shit was really funny actually

29:34.000 --> 29:36.000
Even though we got beat bad

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
Like it was Shane and I

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
Versus Spike

29:40.000 --> 29:42.000
And Tim

29:42.000 --> 29:44.000
It was two on two

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
They wiped the floor with us

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Like five points to nothing

29:48.000 --> 29:50.000
It was depressing

29:50.000 --> 29:52.000
But yeah that was a good time

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
I enjoyed myself

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
So if multiplayer is where Halo is at for you

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
Then you're definitely going to enjoy

29:58.000 --> 30:00.000
Halo 4 I think

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
The graphics are a step up

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
It's just fun again

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
But keep in mind I've been away from Halo

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
For a good three years

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
I'm sure the story mode is great too

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
You know

30:13.000 --> 30:15.000
Everybody says great things about it on the internet

30:15.000 --> 30:17.000
But I'm not as into the lore and all that stuff

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
So I'm like okay yeah

30:19.000 --> 30:21.000
The presentation is really good

30:21.000 --> 30:23.000
There's a pretty cool scene in the beginning

30:23.000 --> 30:25.000
Where you're climbing up a wall and it's kind of neat

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
The other game I want to talk quickly about

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
Little Big Planet Karting I picked up on the PlayStation 3

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
I haven't played a lot of it

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Because I've been too busy with multiplayer on Halo 4

30:33.000 --> 30:35.000
But I like it

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
It really does feel like a fusion

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
Of ModNation Racers

30:39.000 --> 30:41.000
And Little Big Planet

30:41.000 --> 30:43.000
Which is to obviously no one's surprise

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
Because it's the same developers of ModNation Racers

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
With all the Little Big Planet stuff in it

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
It controls great

30:49.000 --> 30:51.000
It's fun

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
I noticed there weren't a lot of people online to race against

30:53.000 --> 30:55.000
I'm not sure what's up with that

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
Maybe because the game is so new and everybody is distracted with Halo 4

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
I was just on at a weird time

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
But yeah

31:01.000 --> 31:03.000
So far I'm liking Little Big Planet Karting

31:03.000 --> 31:05.000
But I need more time with it

31:05.000 --> 31:07.000
To give you my full opinions

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
The other games I'll talk about real quick

31:09.000 --> 31:11.000
Curiosity What's in the Cube

31:11.000 --> 31:13.000
I don't think that's really a game

31:13.000 --> 31:15.000
We shouldn't call it a game

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
It's just a weird thing

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
They're having those server problems left and right

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Which is really unfortunate

31:21.000 --> 31:23.000
But I like the zenness

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Of being able to just sit there and

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
Pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop

31:27.000 --> 31:29.000
And kind of figure out the way to get

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
Huge combos of coins and so forth

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
I was able to get enough coins

31:33.000 --> 31:35.000
You can buy items that will let you break bricks faster

31:35.000 --> 31:37.000
See that was a thing the shop wouldn't even open up for me

31:37.000 --> 31:39.000
Because it was so lagged out

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
I got this pick

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
That let you do 3x3

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
Bricks when you would tap

31:45.000 --> 31:47.000
And you can rack up your combos so much faster

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
When you do that

31:49.000 --> 31:51.000
Doing the little random tappings are much more fruitful

31:51.000 --> 31:53.000
When you do that so kind of neat

31:53.000 --> 31:55.000
But anyway

31:55.000 --> 31:57.000
Curiosity not really a game

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
And they're having a lot of server problems

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
But it's free

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Bemani better than Yaris

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Little bit

32:05.000 --> 32:07.000
The one other thing I want to talk about

32:07.000 --> 32:09.000
Since we are about to have a

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
Bemani-centric interview here in a minute

32:11.000 --> 32:13.000
Reflectbeat is out on the

32:13.000 --> 32:15.000
iOS systems now

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
And you can get that on iPad or iPhone

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
I've been playing a little bit of Reflectbeat on the iPad

32:19.000 --> 32:21.000
I did not know much about this game honestly

32:21.000 --> 32:23.000
I've been out of the loop of a lot of the Bemani stuff

32:23.000 --> 32:25.000
So you know again

32:25.000 --> 32:27.000
It's free you only get 3 songs

32:27.000 --> 32:29.000
Because they're trying to sell you the song packs

32:29.000 --> 32:31.000
But it was different

32:31.000 --> 32:33.000
I want to try some like

32:33.000 --> 32:35.000
Versus and try to like play against somebody

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
Because I think that would be where the game would

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
Because there's more of a versus element to it

32:39.000 --> 32:41.000
Where if you hit certain notes

32:41.000 --> 32:43.000
They'll actually bounce back to the other side

32:43.000 --> 32:45.000
And the other player has to hit them so that's kind of neat

32:45.000 --> 32:47.000
It was kind of fun

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
A little different

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
Alright anyhow

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
We are going to, I'm running a little late here

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
So I want to get this in here

32:55.000 --> 32:57.000
An interview

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
And I'm so happy to welcome to the show

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
Eddie from BemaniStyle.com

33:03.000 --> 33:05.000
A long running website about music gaming

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
And music game culture

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
I want to bring him on the line and talk to him about

33:09.000 --> 33:11.000
What's going on in the music game world

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Hey Eddie you there?

33:13.000 --> 33:15.000
Yeah can you hear me?

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
Yeah we can hear you just fine, how you doing Eddie?

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000
I'm doing alright

33:19.000 --> 33:21.000
Thank you so much for coming on the show

33:21.000 --> 33:23.000
It only took about 10 years right?

33:23.000 --> 33:25.000
Just about yeah

33:25.000 --> 33:27.000
We got an E3 and so forth

33:27.000 --> 33:29.000
But just never really thought to get you on the show

33:29.000 --> 33:31.000
Until now so welcome

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Thanks I appreciate it

33:33.000 --> 33:35.000
Alright well let's just

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
Let's start with some questions

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
If you guys have questions for Eddie I know we probably have some of the

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
BemaniStyle community listening tonight

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
And I know we have some long time fans of music gaming

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
Listening tonight

33:45.000 --> 33:47.000
If you want to ask a question at live.bognetwork.com

33:47.000 --> 33:49.000
Just pop into the chat room and ask away

33:49.000 --> 33:51.000
We'll read some of the questions here

33:51.000 --> 33:53.000
A little later

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
No no you have to ask him on topic

33:57.000 --> 33:59.000
Not a six hour show

33:59.000 --> 34:01.000
So Eddie tell us

34:01.000 --> 34:03.000
A little bit about your website

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
Tell us about where BemaniStyle.com

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
Came from, how did it start?

34:07.000 --> 34:09.000
Funny enough

34:09.000 --> 34:11.000
It actually started

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
Kind of as a result of

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
DDR spot, I don't know if you guys remember that

34:15.000 --> 34:17.000
Site or not but some of the old NorCal

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
Players started that up years ago

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
Kind of like a competitor to

34:21.000 --> 34:23.000
DDRFreak and

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
Mike No

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
Was in Michigan for a tournament

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
Way back in like 2001

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
And we ran into each other

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
And got to talking and at the time it was like

34:33.000 --> 34:35.000
Me, him

34:35.000 --> 34:37.000
The owner of TeamGuilo.net

34:37.000 --> 34:39.000
Which was a Canadian site and

34:39.000 --> 34:41.000
A friend of mine from the New England

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Area named Malcolm, we were all talking about making this

34:43.000 --> 34:45.000
Just gigantic site

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
To cover all music games

34:47.000 --> 34:49.000
Because as it had standed

34:49.000 --> 34:51.000
DDR was being talked about

34:51.000 --> 34:53.000
Like everyone was kind of ignoring the other games

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
And that wasn't really what I was jiving with personally

34:55.000 --> 34:57.000
Because I liked the Five Key stuff a lot

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
And there was

34:59.000 --> 35:01.000
A lot of ego that got in the way

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
From the other two sites

35:03.000 --> 35:05.000
And nothing bad

35:05.000 --> 35:07.000
It wasn't like we were fighting or anything

35:07.000 --> 35:09.000
But there were a lot of arguments about the name and everything

35:09.000 --> 35:11.000
So Malcolm and I just kind of splintered off

35:11.000 --> 35:13.000
And decided to start BemaniStyle

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
You know, on our own

35:15.000 --> 35:17.000
And it was an early effort by

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
Me, him, some guys from the Midwest

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
And a handful of people we knew in Japan

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
To just get more

35:23.000 --> 35:25.000
You know, word out about the other series that people

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
Weren't playing at the time

35:27.000 --> 35:29.000
You've been very successful with BemaniStyle.com

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
Because it's really evolved into a place now where

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
I know for a while you were doing

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
You were doing some type of record distribution

35:35.000 --> 35:37.000
Or record stuff, right?

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
I'm still doing that actually

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
It was kind of like a weird situation

35:41.000 --> 35:43.000
I did

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Slakes CD in the US

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Back in like 2006

35:47.000 --> 35:49.000
And a year later we got in touch with

35:49.000 --> 35:51.000
DJ Chucky and the guys from Groovy

35:51.000 --> 35:53.000
About bringing them

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
Out to the US to play at Anime Central

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
And that kind of spiraled

35:57.000 --> 35:59.000
Into us distributing their albums

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
In North America

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
More Japanese hardcore stuff

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
Not Bemani-centric

36:05.000 --> 36:07.000
But ever since we did that we've had

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
M Project

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
DJ Chucky, No Chin, Groovy

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
Chorus K, Red Alice

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Jackazid

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Just a number of people have been featured in all these music games

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
Out to Chicago for the Anime Central

36:19.000 --> 36:21.000
Show that we do every year

36:21.000 --> 36:23.000
So that's kind of like where that project is

36:23.000 --> 36:25.000
We're actually right now in the planning stages

36:25.000 --> 36:27.000
For our 2013 show

36:27.000 --> 36:29.000
So it's still going on

36:29.000 --> 36:31.000
Awesome, so that's kind of the place to be as Anime Central

36:31.000 --> 36:33.000
If you want to see some of these artists that kind of

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
Started in music games I guess

36:35.000 --> 36:37.000
Or I guess maybe known over here

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
From that or whatever you want to say

36:39.000 --> 36:41.000
Yeah, that's pretty much it

36:41.000 --> 36:43.000
What do you think has kept Bemani Style

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000
I mean, you know, we just saw DDR Freak

36:45.000 --> 36:47.000
You know, you kind of mentioned that

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
Bemani Style kind of started as a

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
It was meant to be somewhat like DDR Freak

36:51.000 --> 36:53.000
But more inclusive of the other music games

36:53.000 --> 36:55.000
Well, obviously DDR Spot

36:55.000 --> 36:57.000
And before they shut down a long time ago

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
DDR Freak just recently in the past year

36:59.000 --> 37:01.000
Finally sunsetted and said

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
You know, party's over

37:03.000 --> 37:05.000
How do you think Bemani Style

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
What's kept Bemani Style

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
Above that and

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
In light of these other sites sunsetting

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
Well, I mean, you know, one thing

37:14.000 --> 37:16.000
When it comes to running a website

37:16.000 --> 37:18.000
Ultimately if it closes that's the decision of the person

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
Who owns the website and quite frankly

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
You know, my feelings on it are

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Even when I have my low points

37:24.000 --> 37:26.000
Which, you know

37:26.000 --> 37:28.000
Got us talking, what, a week ago

37:28.000 --> 37:30.000
A Facebook post that I made about how

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
The community has been lately

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
Even when I've had my low points

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
I just look at it as though I've been doing this site for 10 years

37:36.000 --> 37:38.000
How can you just walk away from something like that

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
Especially when people are still using it

37:40.000 --> 37:42.000
So I think it's just a

37:42.000 --> 37:44.000
There's a genuine interest from a lot of people

37:44.000 --> 37:46.000
Who are really die hard fans for that

37:46.000 --> 37:48.000
Information on, you know, the more

37:48.000 --> 37:50.000
Global games, stuff that's not released over here

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
And then at the same time there are people who are more

37:52.000 --> 37:54.000
Casual that are into maybe

37:54.000 --> 37:56.000
Just the music and they like knowing when

37:56.000 --> 37:58.000
New songs are coming out, they don't play the

37:58.000 --> 38:00.000
Games, they just want to know about the music

38:00.000 --> 38:02.000
I think it's a variety of things, but the community's kind of stuck with us

38:02.000 --> 38:04.000
And I'm just really not

38:04.000 --> 38:06.000
Ready to let it go, so

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
Just sticking with it as long as I can

38:08.000 --> 38:10.000
Since you brought up Facebook

38:10.000 --> 38:12.000
And all that, where is

38:12.000 --> 38:14.000
The community at these days, you think

38:14.000 --> 38:16.000
What is the music game community

38:16.000 --> 38:18.000
It's split, it's kind of weird because

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
You kind of have splinter groups now

38:20.000 --> 38:22.000
In regards to what games people are playing

38:22.000 --> 38:24.000
And what mentalities everybody has

38:24.000 --> 38:26.000
Konami

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Has not really been doing a lot to help

38:28.000 --> 38:30.000
The community over here in the US

38:30.000 --> 38:32.000
They never really have

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
There have been attempts in the past

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
With Beatmania

38:36.000 --> 38:38.000
And the home version DDR's that came out

38:38.000 --> 38:40.000
Early on and DDR continuing on

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
For years, but ultimately

38:42.000 --> 38:44.000
The hardcore fans

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Kind of get the short

38:46.000 --> 38:48.000
End of the stick in the sense that

38:48.000 --> 38:50.000
They're very vocal about

38:50.000 --> 38:52.000
What they want from the games and Konami

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
Has to kind of

38:54.000 --> 38:56.000
Appease both the mainstream

38:56.000 --> 38:58.000
And the hardcore fans

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
And I think they lean a little bit too much towards

39:00.000 --> 39:02.000
The mainstream and not enough towards

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
The hardcore fans

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
So the hardcore fans have just kind of gotten

39:06.000 --> 39:08.000
Sick of it, a lot of them

39:08.000 --> 39:10.000
It's just like any other internet community

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
The more negative people

39:12.000 --> 39:14.000
Tend to be the ones that stand out more

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
In conversation, as opposed to the people who are

39:16.000 --> 39:18.000
Praising the work of the people making the games

39:18.000 --> 39:20.000
Or whatever the subject matter is

39:20.000 --> 39:22.000
So

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
On the outside it looks

39:24.000 --> 39:26.000
As though the community has just

39:26.000 --> 39:28.000
Degenerated to this massive

39:28.000 --> 39:30.000
Negativity

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
They're just tired of not getting

39:33.000 --> 39:35.000
Any of the games and being

39:35.000 --> 39:37.000
Ignored and so on and so forth

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
So you run into situations like what's

39:39.000 --> 39:41.000
Happening right now with the DJ Max

39:41.000 --> 39:43.000
Community, who for the most part

39:43.000 --> 39:45.000
Ever since Technica came out have just been

39:45.000 --> 39:47.000
Growing at an exponential rate

39:47.000 --> 39:49.000
And a lot of them are really fantastic people

39:49.000 --> 39:51.000
But you'll see people that

39:51.000 --> 39:53.000
Once anything goes wrong or something

39:53.000 --> 39:55.000
Doesn't go their way

39:55.000 --> 39:57.000
Everyone starts complaining

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
Or starts just outright

39:59.000 --> 40:01.000
Talking shit about the company that makes the game

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Not really looking at it from their perspective

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
But saying like, hey, this is what I want

40:05.000 --> 40:07.000
Why aren't you doing what I want you to do

40:07.000 --> 40:09.000
And so that tends to stand out over the people

40:09.000 --> 40:11.000
Who are a little bit more

40:11.000 --> 40:13.000
Positive and understanding about everything

40:13.000 --> 40:15.000
So from the outside looking in

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
I think the music game community kind of comes off

40:17.000 --> 40:19.000
As though it's not very

40:19.000 --> 40:21.000
Welcoming as of late

40:21.000 --> 40:23.000
And I've had my criticisms over

40:23.000 --> 40:25.000
Just the general

40:25.000 --> 40:27.000
Attitudes of people for a long time

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
I think there's still just a ton of love

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
For the games and the hardcore players

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
Are a little bit more vocal about

40:33.000 --> 40:35.000
What they expect than the people who play them

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
A little bit more casually

40:37.000 --> 40:39.000
Since you were talking about Konami

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
And kind of like the difficult position

40:41.000 --> 40:43.000
They've been in for many years

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Although I don't know, I kind of think that

40:45.000 --> 40:47.000
All the United States progress

40:47.000 --> 40:49.000
For DDR, anything they had going

40:49.000 --> 40:51.000
For it kind of went away when

40:51.000 --> 40:53.000
Redmond and Hawaii both went away

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
That was pretty much the end of that, right?

40:55.000 --> 40:57.000
I wouldn't necessarily say that

40:57.000 --> 40:59.000
I think that

40:59.000 --> 41:01.000
From a player expectation

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
A lot of that went away because they lost that connection

41:03.000 --> 41:05.000
I mean, when they were doing

41:05.000 --> 41:07.000
The games in Redmond especially

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
The guys working on the games

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
Were fans of DDR

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
A lot of them were really old school

41:13.000 --> 41:15.000
NorCal and SoCal players

41:15.000 --> 41:17.000
So that connection to the community

41:17.000 --> 41:19.000
Definitely went away and I think that caused

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
A lot of problems, but

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
I don't think that the momentum

41:23.000 --> 41:25.000
Went away, so to speak

41:25.000 --> 41:27.000
I think the momentum went away when

41:27.000 --> 41:29.000
Konami wasn't really being as

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
Hands-on with certain projects

41:31.000 --> 41:33.000
As they used to be

41:33.000 --> 41:35.000
So you'd see things like the Wii games

41:35.000 --> 41:37.000
Coming out, I think were a fantastic effort

41:37.000 --> 41:39.000
I think they did a really good job with those

41:39.000 --> 41:41.000
The Xbox and the PS3 versions were kind of

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
Whatever, the song lists weren't fantastic

41:43.000 --> 41:45.000
But I mean, they were still very traditional

41:45.000 --> 41:47.000
DDR games, so then you look at the arcade side of things

41:47.000 --> 41:49.000
And

41:49.000 --> 41:51.000
After not ever

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Making an attempt in North America with the

41:53.000 --> 41:55.000
Arcade releases

41:55.000 --> 41:57.000
Before Extreme, I mean, there was

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
The original DDR 1.5 in the US

41:59.000 --> 42:01.000
And then there was DDR USA

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
But honestly, neither of them were really

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
Valiant efforts on their behalf

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
They kind of ignored everything for a long time

42:07.000 --> 42:09.000
And then the In the Groove thing happened

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
And there was a lot of just

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
I think a lot of people really resented

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
Them for that because they felt like

42:15.000 --> 42:17.000
If you're not going to do anything, why are you taking away

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
Our only outlet for these games?

42:19.000 --> 42:21.000
And then they did Supernova and Supernova 2

42:21.000 --> 42:23.000
Which I personally think were great

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
And those two

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
Like those two games in particular I think were a really good

42:27.000 --> 42:29.000
Effort on their behalf, but then X and X2

42:29.000 --> 42:31.000
Came out and it was just letting the wrong

42:31.000 --> 42:33.000
People handle the franchise

42:33.000 --> 42:35.000
Handle the development of these cabinets

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
And do the release and everything

42:37.000 --> 42:39.000
So we got kind of like a shoddy product

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
I mean, not even kind of a shoddy product

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
It was really a shoddy product

42:43.000 --> 42:45.000
And a lot of people just

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
Kind of got fed up with it and walked away from it

42:47.000 --> 42:49.000
And I mean, I want to clear this up too

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
In regards to the arcade stuff because I know a lot of people bring this up

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
But DDRX2

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
Kind of had the same problems as DDRX1

42:55.000 --> 42:57.000
Did where they were

42:57.000 --> 42:59.000
Lowering the cost of production

42:59.000 --> 43:01.000
On the games and you could tell that

43:01.000 --> 43:03.000
You know, the quality went down a lot

43:03.000 --> 43:05.000
Especially in the dance pads and they made

43:05.000 --> 43:07.000
A conscious effort to try

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
To fix the problems from X

43:09.000 --> 43:11.000
To X2 because

43:11.000 --> 43:13.000
Myself and some friends of mine were brought in

43:13.000 --> 43:15.000
To consult with them specifically on the

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Arcade release to make sure certain things were up to snuff

43:17.000 --> 43:19.000
And when we had seen them

43:19.000 --> 43:21.000
Everything was functioning

43:21.000 --> 43:23.000
Perfectly fine and timing

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
Was fantastic and the games were actually really good quality

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
And X2 as a mix is like one of my favorites

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
In a long time and then

43:29.000 --> 43:31.000
Somewhere between when we did our testing

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
Work with them and the actual release

43:33.000 --> 43:35.000
Something changed and the

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
Final product that we got just ended up being this

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
Shoddy mess that, you know, constantly

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
Ends up in a state of disrepair and is almost

43:41.000 --> 43:43.000
Unplayable

43:43.000 --> 43:45.000
Let me go to the chat because there's quite a few comments

43:45.000 --> 43:47.000
Going on in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
First off, Shane Olinko

43:49.000 --> 43:51.000
Is saying, we worked at Redwood City

43:51.000 --> 43:53.000
Not Redmond, oops, my bad, sorry, I was thinking of the

43:53.000 --> 43:55.000
Wrong video game company apparently, my bad, my bad

43:55.000 --> 43:57.000
Mass effect on the brain?

43:57.000 --> 43:59.000
Apparently, apparently

43:59.000 --> 44:01.000
YYR saying, I still

44:01.000 --> 44:03.000
Believe that Supernova happened because

44:03.000 --> 44:05.000
In The Groove happened and a few folks agreeing

44:05.000 --> 44:07.000
With him, what do you think?

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
I don't think that that's the case

44:09.000 --> 44:11.000
At all actually, a lot of people

44:11.000 --> 44:13.000
Look at that because of the timing

44:13.000 --> 44:15.000
Of the whole thing, but

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
A lot of people also don't remember

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
What it was like when Extreme came out

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
And when Extreme was in testing

44:21.000 --> 44:23.000
They had always been saying that

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
Extreme was kind of like a reboot for them

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
The whole, we're starting all over and

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
You know, kind of giving it a last hurrah

44:29.000 --> 44:31.000
On that hardware, but I think a lot of what

44:31.000 --> 44:33.000
Caused them to take a break for so long was

44:33.000 --> 44:35.000
Just the rampant bootlegging of that game

44:35.000 --> 44:37.000
Just all over the world, they were losing

44:37.000 --> 44:39.000
So much money on it, so many potential sales

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
And a lot of time

44:41.000 --> 44:43.000
Went into developing a little bit

44:43.000 --> 44:45.000
More secure of a system

44:45.000 --> 44:47.000
And in between

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
The period of time from Extreme to Supernova

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
They had released Dancing Stage Fusion

44:51.000 --> 44:53.000
In the UK, which used kind of like the

44:53.000 --> 44:55.000
Middleware hardware

44:55.000 --> 44:57.000
It was the same hardware that Pop and Music

44:57.000 --> 44:59.000
Used, so it was a PS2 based hardware

44:59.000 --> 45:01.000
And it didn't use

45:01.000 --> 45:03.000
Magic Gate Protection, but it was still pretty

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
Uncrackable, and finally

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
They settled on the hardware that was used

45:07.000 --> 45:09.000
Which was basically a PS2 in a box

45:09.000 --> 45:11.000
With an IO board that plugged into everything

45:11.000 --> 45:13.000
And, you know, had its issues with

45:13.000 --> 45:15.000
Hard drives dying and all that other crap

45:15.000 --> 45:17.000
But I think a lot of the delay had more

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
To do with them just trying to get a lockdown

45:19.000 --> 45:21.000
On the issues with all the bootlegging

45:21.000 --> 45:23.000
Since we're talking about like

45:23.000 --> 45:25.000
Reboots and all this stuff and where DDR

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
Is heading, you know, this news came up very

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
Recently, even after I asked you to come

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
On the show originally, that is that

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
There is this Dance Dance Revolution

45:33.000 --> 45:35.000
Reboot that's location testing in Japan

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
Right now, what do you think about this?

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
Good idea for the series?

45:39.000 --> 45:41.000
Bad idea? Not gonna go anywhere?

45:41.000 --> 45:43.000
What do you think? Well, I think too many people are

45:43.000 --> 45:45.000
Looking at it the wrong way. I mean, just because

45:45.000 --> 45:47.000
They went back to naming it Dance Dance

45:47.000 --> 45:49.000
Revolution doesn't necessarily mean it's a reboot

45:49.000 --> 45:51.000
Um, you know

45:51.000 --> 45:53.000
Pop and Music recently lost its

45:53.000 --> 45:55.000
Numbering system. They dropped

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
The newest version is

45:57.000 --> 45:59.000
Technically the 21st version, but there's no

45:59.000 --> 46:01.000
21 anywhere on the banner

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
And Guitar Freaks and

46:03.000 --> 46:05.000
Drum Mania are getting reset as

46:05.000 --> 46:07.000
GITADORA, which is basically just like the

46:07.000 --> 46:09.000
XG games in a shiny white cabinet

46:09.000 --> 46:11.000
And no second player guitar on the Guitar Freaks

46:11.000 --> 46:13.000
version. Are you saying that everything's going the way

46:13.000 --> 46:15.000
Of Apple, where now it's the new DDR?

46:15.000 --> 46:17.000
Uh, well

46:17.000 --> 46:19.000
I think that's what people are gonna end up calling it

46:19.000 --> 46:21.000
DDR 2013, which is

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
What people are calling it right now, but

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
I think that what they're doing is

46:25.000 --> 46:27.000
They're actually kind of going the rock band model

46:27.000 --> 46:29.000
With everything, and they're setting it up to be

46:29.000 --> 46:31.000
A platform as opposed to being

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
Something that you get yearly upgrades

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
On. They have a new pricing

46:35.000 --> 46:37.000
Model for the arcades in Japan that they just

46:37.000 --> 46:39.000
Rolled out with the newest BeatMania, where

46:39.000 --> 46:41.000
The arcades pay a subsidized rate

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
For the hardware and

46:43.000 --> 46:45.000
The game itself, and then Konami

46:45.000 --> 46:47.000
Kind of forces a profit share on the game

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
Through their Paselli and EMUsment networks

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
So every month the arcades

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
Give up a certain amount of their profits, but they're

46:53.000 --> 46:55.000
Paying so much less for the game as a whole

46:55.000 --> 46:57.000
And then throughout the course of the product's

46:57.000 --> 46:59.000
Life, they'll upload a bunch of new

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
Songs and add some features

47:01.000 --> 47:03.000
To the online network, do more unlock games

47:03.000 --> 47:05.000
Or whatever the case may be, and they've already

47:05.000 --> 47:07.000
Said that with the new DDR game, they've stated

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
That every

47:09.000 --> 47:11.000
Six months or so, they're gonna push out

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
Another 30 or 40 songs and a UI

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
Update and possibly new features

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
And stuff, so I think that this is less

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
Of a reboot and more of a way to

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
Kind of

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
Restructure the way they do things

47:23.000 --> 47:25.000
Based on how the arcade market

47:25.000 --> 47:27.000
Has been declining everywhere

47:27.000 --> 47:29.000
In the world, like it's like a conscious

47:29.000 --> 47:31.000
Effort to try to do something that

47:31.000 --> 47:33.000
Arcade operators can work with but doesn't

47:33.000 --> 47:35.000
Leave them in the hole at the end of the day

47:35.000 --> 47:37.000
So this is like

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
The 11th doctor of DDR

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Kinda, sorta

47:41.000 --> 47:43.000
It just sounds like they're forcing them basically to buy

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
An upgrade each year because it's being subsidized

47:45.000 --> 47:47.000
Throughout the entire year, and with

47:47.000 --> 47:49.000
The good faith that they're actually gonna put out

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
30 to 40 songs or whatever for the

47:51.000 --> 47:53.000
Next update, which, let's be honest

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
Compared to what I've seen with the home

47:55.000 --> 47:57.000
Releases and what they support DLC wise

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
That's

47:59.000 --> 48:01.000
I'll be interested to see if they actually

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
Continue on with that after at least

48:03.000 --> 48:05.000
One update

48:05.000 --> 48:07.000
Honestly though, I don't think that that's gonna be the case

48:07.000 --> 48:09.000
I don't think the CS games are at all

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
Indicative of what they're doing with the arcade stuff

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
Because they've been doing download content on the

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
Arcade games for a few versions now

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
2DX18 had

48:17.000 --> 48:19.000
Like an add-on patch really really

48:19.000 --> 48:21.000
Really late into its life with a bunch of

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
Ubeat and Reflectbeat songs on it and then

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
Linkle came out and Linkle had like 2 or 3

48:25.000 --> 48:27.000
Song updates, so I don't think

48:27.000 --> 48:29.000
That they're gonna give up on this

48:29.000 --> 48:31.000
And you've gotta look at it from the perspective of

48:31.000 --> 48:33.000
They're not really selling them upgrades anymore

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
It's

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
Cutting the cost of production and it's also

48:37.000 --> 48:39.000
Cutting the cost of development on these titles

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
So there's no reason for them to not stick with it

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
Because it's constant profit

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
If people are continuing to play the

48:45.000 --> 48:47.000
Games, then the operators are gonna

48:47.000 --> 48:49.000
Stick with the service and they're gonna stay

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
Subscribed to the amusement network and everything

48:51.000 --> 48:53.000
So it doesn't really benefit Konami at all

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
To not stick with it and at the same time

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
It costs them way less in development

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
To do something like this than it would for them

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
To crank out a new game every 8-12 months

49:01.000 --> 49:03.000
Like they've done for the past 10 years

49:03.000 --> 49:05.000
Of the series existence

49:05.000 --> 49:07.000
How does something like that work though

49:07.000 --> 49:09.000
For importers over in the US?

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
It's kind of left to be

49:11.000 --> 49:13.000
Unsaid right now, I mean they haven't

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
They haven't been making any of the games really available

49:15.000 --> 49:17.000
For a while, DDR was available

49:17.000 --> 49:19.000
But it was available in such sketchy

49:19.000 --> 49:21.000
Circumstances

49:21.000 --> 49:23.000
You had to buy, for X and X2

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
You had to buy a new machine from Betzen

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
And then there were these crap machines that would break down

49:27.000 --> 49:29.000
So you'd end up spending more money and repairing

49:29.000 --> 49:31.000
The game than you would make back

49:31.000 --> 49:33.000
And you would never pay off the machine

49:33.000 --> 49:35.000
That happened to a lot of arcades out here

49:35.000 --> 49:37.000
In regards to 2DX and Popin' Music

49:37.000 --> 49:39.000
And Guitar Fricks and Drummania

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
UBeat and Reflectbeat don't even really exist

49:41.000 --> 49:43.000
Over here outside of like

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
3 locations

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
One of them isn't even an arcade that have a UBeat machine

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
They've never been available

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Out here as upgrade kits

49:51.000 --> 49:53.000
Because historically there just wasn't a lot of interest

49:53.000 --> 49:55.000
From the arcade operators

49:55.000 --> 49:57.000
For it, like even when they did the location tests

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
For 2DX14

49:59.000 --> 50:01.000
And they did the UBeat location tests down here in Southern California

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
So

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
For importers, it really

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
It's not

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
Changing the situation

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
For them at all

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Because it's not like people have been importing the games for years anyway

50:13.000 --> 50:15.000
I think the last one that was really readily imported

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
As like a legit game

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
Was maybe 2DX Red

50:19.000 --> 50:21.000
And that was, I don't know, 2003, 2004

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
So

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
I don't think it's really going to affect them at all

50:25.000 --> 50:27.000
At the same time though

50:27.000 --> 50:29.000
I really can't get too much into it

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
But there is some stuff going on

50:31.000 --> 50:33.000
In regards to Konami's American

50:33.000 --> 50:35.000
Arcade operations

50:35.000 --> 50:37.000
That I've, you know, become privy to

50:37.000 --> 50:39.000
And it's not really so much of a guarantee

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
As much as it is

50:41.000 --> 50:43.000
They're showing genuine interest in getting the stuff out here

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
Because round one

50:45.000 --> 50:47.000
Which had just opened up its second location here in Southern California

50:47.000 --> 50:49.000
The music games are actually

50:49.000 --> 50:51.000
Like hand over fist making more money

50:51.000 --> 50:53.000
Than any other arcade games in the location

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
This is including Redemption

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
So they've pretty much put a mandate out

50:57.000 --> 50:59.000
That like all of their music games have to be up 100%

50:59.000 --> 51:01.000
Of the time and if something goes down

51:01.000 --> 51:03.000
It needs to be fixed like immediately

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
Even if the parts need to be ordered from Japan

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000
And Konami's kind of latched on to this

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
And they've been shopping

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
They've been shopping the games around

51:11.000 --> 51:13.000
There are arcade distributors out here

51:13.000 --> 51:15.000
Nothing's, you know, set in stone

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
Or anything like that

51:17.000 --> 51:19.000
But ever since they dropped the bets in as their lead distributor

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
They have been making attempts to try to find someone else out here

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
To handle the stuff

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
So it's really just kind of hard to say where it's going to go

51:25.000 --> 51:27.000
At this point, you know

51:27.000 --> 51:29.000
It's the state of the arcade industry

51:29.000 --> 51:31.000
In North America

51:31.000 --> 51:33.000
That nobody wants to take risks on anything

51:33.000 --> 51:35.000
That's going to cost money

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
And I think that might end up hurting it more

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
Than Konami's unwillingness to release anything

51:39.000 --> 51:41.000
Am I to infer from this a little bit

51:41.000 --> 51:43.000
That maybe the, you know, we've talked about

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
Arcade, the arcade scene has been hurting

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
For such a long time here in the states

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
At least certainly the way we used to know it

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
Am I to infer from this that maybe music games

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
Are a way to get

51:53.000 --> 51:55.000
Quote, quote, I'm using my quotey fingers

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
Real games back in the arcade

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
Well, you know, think back to 10 years ago

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
When DDR first started getting popular in the US

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
Arcades had been dead since

52:03.000 --> 52:05.000
You know, Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter 2

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
So it's

52:07.000 --> 52:09.000
I see it as a cycle

52:09.000 --> 52:11.000
I see the whole arcade industry as a cycle

52:11.000 --> 52:13.000
And not to deviate too much from the conversation

52:13.000 --> 52:15.000
But, you know, the arcade industry

52:15.000 --> 52:17.000
Just doesn't

52:17.000 --> 52:19.000
A lot of the operators are old

52:19.000 --> 52:21.000
Older guys, there's a handful of younger guys

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
Who have been starting up their own places

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
But a lot of arcade operators are older guys

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
That just don't want to take risks on stuff anymore

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
So redemption kind of rules

52:29.000 --> 52:31.000
That's the king of the arcade space right now

52:31.000 --> 52:33.000
Because that's what's making money

52:33.000 --> 52:35.000
But there's a lot of laws that have been

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
Brought to light, not really

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
They're not actually laws, but there's a lot of laws that are being

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
Proposed right now to kind of kill the

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Redemption market because it's essentially

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Gambling for children

52:45.000 --> 52:47.000
If something like that passes, it's going to

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
Cause a huge change in the arcade market

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
But, you know, there are certain

52:51.000 --> 52:53.000
Things like, I listened to the last few episodes

52:53.000 --> 52:55.000
And you guys are talking about Wreck-It Ralph

52:55.000 --> 52:57.000
And I think

52:57.000 --> 52:59.000
That the arcade industry as a whole

52:59.000 --> 53:01.000
Missed its entire mark with that movie

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
I think that that would have been

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
A perfect chance for them to

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
Maybe appeal to Disney to do some more

53:07.000 --> 53:09.000
Cross-promotion and get people out to their locations

53:09.000 --> 53:11.000
And bring some life back to the arcades again

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
And nobody capitalized that at all

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
There's always a DVD release

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
Yeah, but, you know, it's still going to be limited

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
At that point, I think it's better to strike

53:19.000 --> 53:21.000
When the iron's hot, I went to a movie

53:21.000 --> 53:23.000
Theater up here to see it, and they had

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
Like two arcade games in the entire place

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
You'd think that a movie theater who's

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
Expected, and it's like the number one movie in America

53:29.000 --> 53:31.000
Right now, like, wouldn't that get

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
You to go to your route operators

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
And be like, hey, get some more stuff in here right away

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
We've got some extra space for you, bring in

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
Like a Pac-Man or bring in a racing game

53:39.000 --> 53:41.000
Or something like that

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
Or one of those Wreck-It Ralph cabinets that they made

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
You know, just for fun

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
They're limited, though, I think they only put out like 30 of them

53:47.000 --> 53:49.000
Well, why? Why not make more?

53:49.000 --> 53:51.000
It wouldn't be that expensive to set something up

53:51.000 --> 53:53.000
I mean, if you can run the game on an iPad, then

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Yeah, you know, it's a promotional thing

53:55.000 --> 53:57.000
The game was free on iPad

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
I know you're big on Disney like all of us

53:59.000 --> 54:01.000
But the thing about Electronica was that little arcade they had there

54:01.000 --> 54:03.000
With all the perfect machines

54:03.000 --> 54:05.000
Yeah, well

54:05.000 --> 54:07.000
I still think Electronica kind of missed its point

54:07.000 --> 54:09.000
A little bit, too

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
I mean, like, I'm really critical of the arcade industry

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
So I'm not really the right guy to talk about something like that

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
That's fine

54:15.000 --> 54:17.000
You know, they

54:17.000 --> 54:19.000
The thing with the Wreck-It Ralph machines is that

54:19.000 --> 54:21.000
They're converted Donkey Kong cabinets

54:21.000 --> 54:23.000
So it's not like there's like a

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
Pleather of those available for them to just

54:25.000 --> 54:27.000
You know, fix up and clean up

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
And throw the game into

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
I'm sure they worked within their means to get that released

54:31.000 --> 54:33.000
So, I mean, yeah, they could hobble

54:33.000 --> 54:35.000
Something together and release it

54:35.000 --> 54:37.000
But, you know, where I think they really missed the mark

54:37.000 --> 54:39.000
And me and a friend of mine was talking about this at an arcade auction

54:39.000 --> 54:41.000
Last week

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
Why didn't they make a game based on Sugar Rush?

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
How hard would it be to

54:45.000 --> 54:47.000
Throw a skin on a racing game

54:47.000 --> 54:49.000
And add in some of the features that were featured

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000
In the movie that were kind of talked about with that game

54:51.000 --> 54:53.000
And then push it out as an arcade game

54:53.000 --> 54:55.000
Like, that's the missed

54:55.000 --> 54:57.000
Cross-promotion opportunity of the year right there

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
You know, you market that in Japan

54:59.000 --> 55:01.000
With AKB48 doing the soundtrack

55:01.000 --> 55:03.000
And you're set

55:03.000 --> 55:05.000
Well, it'd be the new maximum tune

55:05.000 --> 55:07.000
I swear, I was listening to the end credits

55:07.000 --> 55:09.000
Going, is that AKB48?

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
It is AKB48

55:11.000 --> 55:13.000
Well, that was kind of big news in the J-pop community

55:13.000 --> 55:15.000
Like, kind of how

55:15.000 --> 55:17.000
Perfume being in Cars 2 was

55:17.000 --> 55:19.000
You know, they kind of got a lot of people talking

55:19.000 --> 55:21.000
I just think they're, I love the movie

55:21.000 --> 55:23.000
It was fantastic, but I think the whole industry

55:23.000 --> 55:25.000
Kind of missed a lot of points

55:25.000 --> 55:27.000
All the cameos were fantastic

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
But I think, you know, people didn't really handle

55:29.000 --> 55:31.000
The release of that movie properly

55:31.000 --> 55:33.000
I don't think there was enough faith placed in it

55:35.000 --> 55:37.000
I got just a couple more questions for you

55:37.000 --> 55:39.000
And then I want to go to the chat to see if they have anything

55:39.000 --> 55:41.000
I already see a few things popping up here

55:41.000 --> 55:44.000
But I've been dying to ask you this for years

55:44.000 --> 55:46.000
And this is a very controversial question

55:46.000 --> 55:48.000
Within the community, but I have to know

55:48.000 --> 55:50.000
What you think about this one being

55:50.000 --> 55:52.000
You know, so vested in the community and so forth

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
So, and it's about Guitar Hero

55:54.000 --> 55:56.000
Because, you know, and I know this is like

55:56.000 --> 55:58.000
Hello five years ago, but

55:58.000 --> 56:00.000
When this game took off, there was a lot of people

56:00.000 --> 56:02.000
In the community, they thought

56:02.000 --> 56:04.000
You know, Konami was robbed of Guitar Freaks

56:04.000 --> 56:06.000
And Guitar Hero has just come in

56:06.000 --> 56:08.000
And taken all the credit

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
We all remember that review that X-Play did

56:10.000 --> 56:12.000
Of Beatmania that was ridiculous

56:12.000 --> 56:14.000
Where they said it was ripping off Guitar Hero

56:14.000 --> 56:16.000
And all that, do you think Guitar Hero

56:16.000 --> 56:18.000
At the end of the day, was it a good thing?

56:18.000 --> 56:20.000
Or was it a bad thing?

56:20.000 --> 56:22.000
For American fans of Japanese music games?

56:24.000 --> 56:26.000
I think Guitar Hero

56:26.000 --> 56:28.000
Before Red Octane was purchased

56:28.000 --> 56:30.000
By Activision was a fantastic thing

56:30.000 --> 56:32.000
For the music game community in the US

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
When the game

56:34.000 --> 56:36.000
Before the game was even announced

56:36.000 --> 56:38.000
To the public, I got a chance

56:38.000 --> 56:40.000
To see it

56:40.000 --> 56:42.000
I was hooked up with the guys at Red Octane

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
They brought me in to see it like shortly after

56:44.000 --> 56:46.000
In the Groove PS2 launch party

56:46.000 --> 56:48.000
And I walked out of that

56:48.000 --> 56:50.000
That viewing just completely blown away by it

56:50.000 --> 56:52.000
Because it was

56:52.000 --> 56:54.000
As far as a music game goes

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
In North America, it was exactly what it needed to be

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
Because it's got enough

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
There for both the hardcore player

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
Who wants to challenge

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
But it's got the music that the mainstream player

57:04.000 --> 57:06.000
Can kind of latch onto

57:06.000 --> 57:08.000
I still play rock band like crazy

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
So I think that it was a great thing

57:10.000 --> 57:12.000
But I think once Activision took a hold of it

57:12.000 --> 57:14.000
And then started milking the franchise

57:14.000 --> 57:16.000
For everything it was worth

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
The eventual downfall of the whole

57:18.000 --> 57:20.000
Band based music game

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
Like all together

57:22.000 --> 57:24.000
I think that that was really kind of where they missed

57:24.000 --> 57:26.000
Their mark and handled it

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
They didn't handle it right at all

57:28.000 --> 57:30.000
But I think initially it was a great idea

57:30.000 --> 57:32.000
And it's not really like Konami was robbed of it

57:32.000 --> 57:34.000
They knew the game was coming out

57:34.000 --> 57:36.000
And they made the conscious effort not to release it

57:36.000 --> 57:38.000
And a lot of people don't remember this either

57:38.000 --> 57:40.000
But back in 2000, Guitar Freaks was slated for release

57:40.000 --> 57:42.000
In the US, I still have a receipt

57:42.000 --> 57:44.000
Some here in all my random music game

57:44.000 --> 57:46.000
Collectibles for a pre-order that I placed at

57:46.000 --> 57:48.000
FYE in Cleveland, Ohio

57:48.000 --> 57:50.000
Back in like, I want to say

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
March of 2000 for that game

57:52.000 --> 57:54.000
And then it got cancelled like last minute

57:54.000 --> 57:56.000
Well I remember playing the arcade version

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
All the time, the US releases

57:58.000 --> 58:00.000
You know, and

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
What was it that someone was telling me

58:02.000 --> 58:04.000
When I was still playing it

58:04.000 --> 58:06.000
Oh yeah, I got my pre-order in

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
Basically what you were saying

58:08.000 --> 58:10.000
But I remember when we got contacted

58:10.000 --> 58:12.000
For them to do something for the local news

58:12.000 --> 58:14.000
For Guitar Hero

58:14.000 --> 58:16.000
At my house and they made me hide

58:16.000 --> 58:18.000
My Guitar Freaks stuff

58:18.000 --> 58:20.000
I think that's more of like a

58:20.000 --> 58:22.000
Lawsuit issue than anything else

58:22.000 --> 58:24.000
You know, Activision did kind of go

58:24.000 --> 58:26.000
Not Activision, but Red Octane went around that whole issue

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
The right way

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
They worked with Konami to get the licensing cleared

58:30.000 --> 58:32.000
For the release on that, unlike

58:32.000 --> 58:34.000
Some previous music games have been done

58:34.000 --> 58:36.000
So that's kind of weird to hear

58:36.000 --> 58:38.000
Now I don't think Konami was really robbed of anything

58:38.000 --> 58:40.000
I think that, you know, that was their fault

58:40.000 --> 58:42.000
For not releasing the game when they had the opportunity

58:42.000 --> 58:44.000
And really grabbing hold of that market early on

58:44.000 --> 58:46.000
Absolutely

58:46.000 --> 58:48.000
Especially if they were, if Red Octane was working with

58:48.000 --> 58:50.000
Konami over the licensing then

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
They saw, they had their eyes open the whole time

58:52.000 --> 58:54.000
Well yeah, and that's why Konami ended up

58:54.000 --> 58:56.000
Producing the arcade cabinet

58:56.000 --> 58:58.000
Part of the licensing agreement

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
That they had for that game

59:00.000 --> 59:02.000
Was that Konami would take over the rights to produce

59:02.000 --> 59:04.000
And, you know, build the arcade cabinets

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
For that title

59:06.000 --> 59:08.000
Max Ninja in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

59:08.000 --> 59:10.000
Guitar Heroes 1, 2, and 3 are the best Guitar Hero games

59:10.000 --> 59:12.000
After that, it just sucked

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
I wouldn't even really say

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
Guitar Hero 3 was that great

59:16.000 --> 59:18.000
That was still never soft

59:18.000 --> 59:20.000
It was better than any of their other offerings

59:20.000 --> 59:22.000
But I still wouldn't say that it was like

59:22.000 --> 59:24.000
The top tier of the franchise

59:24.000 --> 59:26.000
It was definitely the cliff teetering game

59:26.000 --> 59:28.000
Where it's like, oh, here we go, we're on our way down

59:28.000 --> 59:30.000
Yeah, pretty much

59:30.000 --> 59:32.000
I was gonna say, I wonder what part of the agreement

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
Between Activision and Konami

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
That they decided that they're gonna put out a really terrible

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
Music game called Rock Revolution

59:38.000 --> 59:40.000
And then help the sales of Guitar Heroes

59:40.000 --> 59:42.000
The stories I could tell you

59:42.000 --> 59:44.000
That I've heard about that one

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
Cause I know guys that worked on that on both sides

59:46.000 --> 59:48.000
In America and Japan

59:48.000 --> 59:50.000
And the guys in America were like

59:50.000 --> 59:52.000
Gung-ho, they wanted to make this

59:52.000 --> 59:54.000
The best effort they ever possibly could have

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
And I don't know if you guys

59:56.000 --> 59:58.000
Ever played the drum portion of that game

59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
With the actual controller

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
But the drum controller that they made for Rock Revolution

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Is the best

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Retail drum controller

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
That comes packaged with one

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Like it's better than the Guitar Hero

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Drum controller, it's better than the Rock Band

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Drum controller, it was awesome

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
But they produced so few of them

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Like nobody really got a chance to get a hold of those

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
But one of the stories that I had heard about that game

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Was that the guy who started that whole project

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
In Japan

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Was actually doing it as like a quote unquote

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Revenge project

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Against the companies in America

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
That had put out these rock games

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000
And I don't really know

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000
What his meaning of revenge was

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
Like was it to release a really bad game

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
And punish the fans or was it like

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
To try to put something out that would

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Take all the sales

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
That sounds like Wile E. Coyote kind of revenge

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Where he builds the elaborate

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Trap only to have a blow up in his face

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Pretty much

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000
We obviously

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Would not be able to get through an interview with you

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Without talking at least a little bit about

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
DJ Max

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
I have loved music games

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
For a very long time

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
When OLR went through

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000
It's creative shift a few years ago

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
We kind of opened ourselves up to the different types of games

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000
I have not been following the DJ Max

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
News as rabidly as I was

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
The earlier Konami series

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Although when I saw

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
The Technica machine in the arcade

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
I thought it was a good time

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
And I know there's a lot of stuff that they've been trying to do

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
With the Vita and so forth

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
What do you think maybe an old school music game fan

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Like me who's kind of turned away

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
From that scene a little bit

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
What do you think

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Maybe I should be looking at in

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
DJ Max? Why should I maybe come back and

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Give DJ Max a look?

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Well it depends on which one you're going to play

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000
If you're going to play Technica

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Then that's kind of like a whole different can of worms

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Than if you're going to play the portable games

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Which obviously would take a little bit of

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Importing and dusting off your PSP

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000
I think with DJ Max

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
As a franchise

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
There's a lot of people out there that know that I work for Pentavision

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000
So I don't want anyone to think that this is like a

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Company shill kind of thing here

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000
My attraction to the DJ Max franchise

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Is kind of the same attraction that I have

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
To Konami's Bimani games

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
And that's the music that they use

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
In the game

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
It's a lot of original producers

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Producing stuff under different genres

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
And there's a lot of variety to the music

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000
In and of itself

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
My attraction to music games personally

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Has a lot less to do with the gameplay

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
And a lot less to do with the music that they use

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
So that's kind of where I think the strong point of the DJ Max franchise

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Is that they really have like a

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Very very diverse

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Song list across all of the games

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Whereas a lot of the Konami games

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Shy of pop and music stick with the genre

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000
That is kind of reflective of the gameplay

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Itself, so 2DX is a lot of

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Electronic music, Guitar Freak Syndrome

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
And he has a lot of rock, so on and so forth

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Now DJ Max has got everything from

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Like hip-hop to R&B to like

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
A plethora

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Of electronic genres

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
And you know

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Hard rock music, punk rock music

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Hardcore

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Classic, I mean like it's

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
That's really where it shines for me

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
The gameplay in Technica

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
If you're speaking of that specifically

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
It's different

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000
You know there's a lot to it that's similar to the other games

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000
But the whole touchscreen interface

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000
And the way that the interface of the game itself

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Functions is different

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000
And it was kind of fresh at the time that it came out

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Obviously it's been you know 4 years since then

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
But it's very fresh

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Compared to a lot of other music game interfaces

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Out there and it's not too hard to

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Pick up and just the way

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
That you interact with the game is very fun

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
So I would say you know if you're a fan

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000
Of the music that's what you should be looking forward to

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000
The most because there's just a ton of

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Really fantastic music in those games

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Alright well we've had Eddie on like way longer

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Than we said we were going to have him on

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
But if he's down with it I want to get

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
A few questions from the chat room out

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000
So live.vognetwork.com is the place to ask your questions

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Let me ask this one

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
That was asked earlier from DasBacon

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Who asked

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
You got a left check

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
I'm going to say beforehand by the way

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
He's my roommate and he works on the website

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000
So his question is kind of like a midpoint

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Loaded question alright

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000
I'll ask it anyway since I didn't know that

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000
And I thought it was a good question

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
What is the future of Bomani Style?

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Well we're just

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Kind of keep pushing forward really

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
We had a huge server outage earlier

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:20.000
In the year and

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
It caused us to lose all the

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Original data

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000
It's still out there it's not like the

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000
Original hard drives died or anything like that

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.000
But we don't have access to the server that the site used to be

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Hosted on due to a complication with our old host

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
So

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
You know there was like a good

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Six months or so where I

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Just kind of gave up on everything

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000
And nothing was getting done

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
But just recently you know I've got

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
That bug again and I've got a few people helping us out

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
And we're going to just kind of push

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Forward in getting the most

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Recent version that we had been developing

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
For like the past two years finished and online

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
With the resources that we have available

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
And people will start seeing that soon

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
With the headline section rolling out

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000
We've got a new machine location database

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
On deck

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Score trackers

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
For just about every single game out there

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
I mean even ridiculous stuff

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Like pop and stage will have a score tracker on the website

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
We're going to do

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Like a greatly expanded

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Sim file database because that was like one of the most

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Popular things we had on the site with

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
New sorting options and just like

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
A lot better ways to promote

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Your files than what we had

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Before because there was a lot of really

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Good stuff that would just get hidden amongst like

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000
A sea of crap and

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
That's one of the things we definitely want to change

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
This time around once we get that going

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Legend of Zaku wants to know is the

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Bimani Land Ranch still open?

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
We moved

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
From the Bimani Land Ranch

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Now we live in what we call the Bimani Land Resort

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.000
Second style

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
It's a

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
The old house was a ranch house in Anaheim

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
California and it was just a really big place

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
And we had like 30 arcade cabinets there

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
And the new house

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
It's not as open to the public as it used to be

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Just because of space and we sold off some of the machines

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.000
But we still have all of the key machines

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
You know we keep them updated

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
And now we have a pool

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000
A hot tub and a koi pond

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000
And a nice atrium so it's like a

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Really kind of a relaxed place to hang out

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
It's still open

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
If you contact me via email or Facebook

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Or whatever if you're going to be in town

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:22.000
We can arrange to have you come over and hang out

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Heck yeah we come to Disneyland down there all the time

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
We're going to come storm the place

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
If you guys come down here

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000
And not hang out at my house

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Let's see

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Shane Olinko

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Is asking a question

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
I'm young and cheek but I'll ask it anyway

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Because a lot of people always kind of want to know

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
How do I break into the industry

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
How can I get hired at Pentavision

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
I don't even know if this is the one you can answer

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
I honestly don't even know man

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:50.000
I got hired on accident

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Like honestly speaking I got brought in

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000
With a bunch of friends of mine

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
To consult for Technica 2

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
When it first came out and we were helping them

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000
With the Technica 2.5

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
Project that never actually ended up happening

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
And in one of the meetings

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
They were basically staying

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000
They really liked

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Or they appreciated all the help that we were giving them

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000
And were like well we wish we could compensate you some way

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
And I was working for this just

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Awful bankruptcy law firm

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Doing all their online marketing and I was just like

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Give me a job, get me out of my job

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.000
And it's cool, I'll do all this stuff for free

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
And they brought me on

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Nice

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000
So you just got to beg and ask a lot

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Well it wasn't really

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Like a begging kind of situation

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
They put it on the table first

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
I just said hey hire me

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
And it just ended up working out that way

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
You know Pentavision is a company

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Here in the US specifically

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000
They're really in tune

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
With the fans, they like listening to input

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
A lot and they really feel bad

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000
When they do something that ends up disappointing

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
People

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
So really it's just a matter of like I'm sure

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Whenever we end up hiring

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
Which isn't really something we have on deck right now

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
But whenever we end up hiring I'm sure

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
The doors will be open to members of the community

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Who are passionate enough that have the skills

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
To want to work with us

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
So I guess just keep an eye out on the Pentavision

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Global website

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
If we ever throw up any job postings

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Give us a contact

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Let me ask this question from somebody

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
They didn't change their nickname so I'll just call them 693

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Because that's the number they got

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000
What do you think is the future

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
What do you think is the future of console

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Rhythm music games

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
And he follows up and says specifically

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000
Ronnie CS games but I'm kind of interested

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
In the general sense

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
What do you think is the future of console music games

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000
In North America

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000
I really couldn't even give you

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000
An honest answer

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000
The market in the US has

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Just proven itself to not be there

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Especially as of late

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Harmonix has a good thing going with

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000
The Rock Band 3 setup

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000
The game doesn't need anything else added to it

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
So just cranking out new songs is perfect

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000
For their existing user base

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000
And Dance Central

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Dance Central and Just Dance

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Those will probably continue to be

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Yearly games just because of the necessity

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Of releasing them on a disc

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
There's a lot of data that goes into

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
The moves and choreographing

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
The characters and stuff

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
So I'm sure those will continue to be on disc

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
But as far as hardcore music games

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
I can't be 100% certain

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Of this and I know I'm gonna

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Break wide open

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Some news here but

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Konami didn't show DDR at E3

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
This year and when I

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Had asked them about it they had stated

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000
That it was because they wanted to take the franchise

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Back to the drawing board and figure out

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000
A new way to do it that could

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Cross both types of rhythm

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Gamers

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000
I've wanted to pitch that

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000
I've been talking about that for a long time

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Well they clearly stole it from you

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Damn it I wanted to pitch something that was a cross

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Between Dance Dance Revolution and Dance Masters

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Basically kind of like what Dance Central is

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
So you've got some of the appeals to arcade fans

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Some of the appeals to like

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Just Dance stuff and then also on top of that

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Have some sort of

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000
I had envisioned

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000
This kind of revolution adventure

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Kind of taking their adventure mode

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
But way beyond where they had it

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Alright let the man finish I want to hear E3 gossip

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000
So anyway

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000
They had told me that they wanted to take it back to the drawing board

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
I don't really know what that meant

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000
And this wasn't really a confirmation from them

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000
But through a mutual friend of mine

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Or ours I should say

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
I found out

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Maybe

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Three or four weeks ago

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
That right around E3

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000
I think maybe two weeks beforehand

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
That Naoki had quit Konami

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000
And it's speculative on my behalf

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000
But I would not be surprised

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000
If that had something to do with the delay

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000
In the game this year because he was the one

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000
That was heading up that entire project

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
So I know since then

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Things have been handed off to U1

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000
Who's heading up DDR 2013

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
In the arcades

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000
But yeah

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000
As far as the US goes I really couldn't say

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
It's too hard to tell

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
I mean Pentavision we're releasing

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000
DJ Max Technica Tune soon

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
But realistically

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000
We're just not sure

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000
How it's going to sell because the Vita

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Is not a very widely performing

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Platform right now

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
And it's been really hard

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
To market that game as a result of some of the

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000
Contracts we have in place with our worldwide

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
Partners so the word hasn't gotten

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Out about that title enough

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000
In terms of Japanese music games

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
I don't

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000
My honest opinion is I don't think they really

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Need to do console versions for them

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Anymore because they have the arcades

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000
And I think that when you do

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000
A console version of a game that is primarily

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000
An arcade game like it is over there

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000
You're just taking

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Activity away from the arcades at that point

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
And so it's not to say

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
That I don't think Konami will ever do another

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Console music game because obviously they're doing

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
You know Ubeat and Reflectbeat on the iPad

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000
But I don't think that they really need to do

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
The console games I know that a lot of North

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000
American fans hate me for saying that

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000
And it definitely feel like they're owed

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Those console games but that's not the way

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000
The market works in Japan and since the games

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Are primarily Japanese I think that

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000
You know that's just kind of the state of

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000
Where they're at

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
But without the console version of DDR how will I make my

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000
Data

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000
See they made that really

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Crappy flash utility

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000
For DDRX in the US

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000
And a whole five people used it

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
So I'm sure there's

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Ways around it it's not like people aren't clever

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000
There's a guy out there that wrote a utility

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000
That lets you create edits in StepMania

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000
And then export them as data that you could use in the

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Arcade cabinets so

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
People in the Bimani community are way too

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
Clever for their own good sometimes

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
See I know what the solution to everything is

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000
To Para Para

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000
Dance Masters is though

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000
I actually like Dance Masters

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Because of the Para Para

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Well Dance Evolution came out as an arcade cabinet in Japan

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000
And apparently it's one of those

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000
Games that's not talked about widely but they get regular

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Updates with new songs

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000
So it's still kind of doing

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Well I guess and it you know that was one of the

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000
Questions that I asked Naoki when we talked at

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000
E3 a few years ago when Dance Masters

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000
Had been first released I said you know

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000
I noticed that Night of Fire is in this game

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000
And just you use the original

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Routine for it

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Is this influenced by Para Para

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000
At all? And he was like no

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000
No I worked on Para Para but it's not the same game

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000
But it's Para Para it's essentially like the

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
Connect version of Para

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000
Especially since they opened the old location of

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Valfar up as Nikufar

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
You know the Para Para scene is coming back so

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000
Yeah well they never really died

01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000
It just kind of like shrunk and now it's

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000
Expanding again so

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000
You know it's just one of those things I guess

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Maybe when it gets big enough

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
To make them make notice again

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000
And it's got like a type of music that it

01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000
Latches onto once again because I think

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000
I don't know if like the Hyper

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Or was it Hyper Techno stuff I don't know if that's

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000
Still really as relevant as it was a few years ago

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000
But I think if they latch onto

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000
A new style of music and it becomes popular

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
In the mainstream of Japan again you could possibly

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000
See another Para Para game get released

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Well Eddie you've been a really good sport

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000
On the show tonight I know we

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000
Said we'd have you on for about 20 minutes

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000
We're closer to 40 almost 45 now

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000
So I want to thank you for taking the extra time

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.000
On the show tonight before we wrap up there is

01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000
A question I always ask all the guests that come on

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000
The show what are

01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000
You playing these days and it doesn't even have to

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000
Be music games unless it happens to be music games

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
What video games are you into right now?

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000
I've been playing

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000
A little bit of

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000
New Super Mario Brothers 2

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000
Although I haven't been able to get into it as much as

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.000
The original one for the DS

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000
Actually

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000
I feel kind of weird saying it

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000
But I've been really addicted

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000
To the Adventure Time turbo jumping

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000
Fin game on iOS lately

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000
It's such like a

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
It's an easy pick up and play like I could play it

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000
For two minutes anywhere and then like I'm all

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000
Over that and I love Adventure Time

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000
I'm obsessed with it and I can't wait for the game coming out

01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:52.000
Later this month but

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Other than that

01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000
I'm going to start playing

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Halo 4 soon and

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000
I'm planning to pick up Super Paper Mario Sticker Star

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
Later on this week

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Nice, well Eddie before we let you go

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000
I want to get the plugs out there for your stuff

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000
If you don't already know about this website

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000
And you're into music game fans

01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:12.000
Or if you're into music games I'm not sure how that's possible

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000
But bimanistyle.com

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000
Is the place to get all the latest and greatest

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:18.000
And what's going on in the music game scene especially

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Overseas and so forth right?

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Oh yeah I mean well

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000
I don't want to be

01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:26.000
Egotistical about it there are other

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:28.000
Resources out there that have been doing a better job

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Than us lately but we try our best

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.000
And we have a lot of

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Friends in the industry so we come up with some

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000
Pretty interesting stuff from time to time

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000
So I'd say we're worth checking out

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.000
Anything else you want to plug while you're here on the show tonight?

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
If you guys are in the Chicago

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Land area this upcoming May

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
I'm not really too sure of the dates I'd go check it out on

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Asen.org but we are doing

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000
Another show at Anime Central this upcoming year

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000
With the Japanese guys

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000
We haven't announced the roster

01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.000
Yet but the guys we have on deck a lot of them

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:58.000
Have had music in the most recent Konami

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Music games and the parties we do are

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
A really good time you can ask anybody who's been there

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
So check out

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
Anime Central next year in Chicago

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.000
And come party it up with us

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Alright I'm going to close tonight with a question

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000
From Miko in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000
Eddie

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000
Does solo suck anyway?

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000
Dude

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
You don't even need to ask me the question

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Or the answer to that question everybody knows

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
That solo does suck anyway

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000
And before I leave I do want to say this too

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Apparently DJ Hung

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Has been found working the shoe

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Department of Nordstrom's in

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000
Northern California recently

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000
He was spotted not too long ago

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000
And I really wanted to run into the

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Department store and ask him that question

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:42.000
But he wasn't working the day that I was in town

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000
I have memories

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Good times. Eddie from

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:52.000
We started all about

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.000
And one of our original loves the music game scene

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000

Yep see you later. Bye

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:10.000
Awesome

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000
Thanks to Eddie from BimaniStyle.com

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000
For coming on the show appreciate that

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:16.000
He works at the shoe department

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:18.000
At Nordstrom's that guy

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.000
Hey you know what

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000
A couple of the

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000
People that you know

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000
The step squad ladies are now moms

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000
You know

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000
A few people have

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Shed whole people

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
It's really amazing to look

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.000
At like some of those people that we knew

01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.000
Ten years ago and would see at the DER tournaments

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
And so forth and like what they're all doing now

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000
And it's funny like some of them went to go work in the industry

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000
Like you know Mel B and Shane and some of those people

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.000
And some of them I look at and they're like

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Getting married and stuff and I'm like I knew you

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.000
When you were 13

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.000
Yikes

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.000
Alright anyhow that was a very long interview

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.000
But it was great worth every minute

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000
But we do want to keep moving on with the show

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.000
We have some news to get into

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Let me just get the housekeeping out of the way because I plug this every week

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:04.000
Twitter twitter.com slash olr

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.000
And our Facebook facebook.com slash orange lounge radio

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000
And of course we are nominated

01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.000
In the podcast awards

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Awards at podcastawards.com

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000
There's only about I think 4 days left

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000
To vote through the 15th

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:18.000
You can vote every day we are nominated as best

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:20.000
Gaming and we would really

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.000
Appreciate your support obviously

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:24.000
We don't have the financial backing of

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:26.000
A large commercially funded website

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:28.000
So word of mouth is all we got

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.000
So we really do appreciate every vote

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:32.000
Please even if you're not going to vote for us

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Keep it indie that's all we ask

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.000
To register participation

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000
For this week's episode of orange lounge radio

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.000
At vog network dot com

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.000
Use the pass phrase detail

01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:44.000
Let's move on with some news

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.000
Finally Loki

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000
Hey that's alright it was a great great show

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000
So far tonight absolutely fantastic

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000
So let's talk a little bit about the Wii U because

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000
We're right we're very close

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000
To the Wii U launch one week from today

01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000
And of course there's still

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.000
Some of that stuff

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Out there that we don't yet know

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:04.000
But mainly kind of tied with the whole network stuff

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
So first off what is

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000
Nintendo network ID

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
And they actually have this whole kind of

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Either Nintendo

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
Direct press conference

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Or not even press conference like

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.000
Consumer conferencing

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000
Stream web video whatever you want to call it

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Anyways so they talked a little bit about it

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Basically what it is is that the friend code

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
System has kind of been

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:28.000
It's gone away and now it's being replaced by this

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Nintendo network ID

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
And what the ID is going to be used for is

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Basically like the 3DS

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.000
They say smartphones

01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000
And PCs

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Also of course

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.000
The Wii U

01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000
And it's going to be basically tied so that

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:46.000
You know you have all your software

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
You know logged into one thing

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.000
In layman's terms

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000
It's basically going to be an account name

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000
So like you know you have an Xbox Live

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000
Or Playstation Network you have an account

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000
All that stuff is tied to you're going to have an account

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000
That's going to be a name and tie it to that

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.000
And you can make

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000
Your friends and do all that stuff

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000
So fantastic

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000
Getting with the 21st century

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.000
And getting rid of stupid friend codes

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000
Welcome to the big kids table

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Nintendo yay

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Mommy wow

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000
Yes so it says basically

01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:20.000
Users can exchange

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.000
You know the

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.000
Number of whatever this number is

01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:26.000
Or

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:28.000
I guess just like a friends code

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000
But then also they'll also be able to

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.000
Register friends I guess

01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000
They meet with Mevers so there may be a

01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000
Number still tied to your account

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000
However I think they're going to have

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:40.000
A name to that as well

01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.000
Or it's going to be just one number

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.000
That you're going to have for all future

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000
Nintendo consoles or whatever

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000
So there's that and then of course

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000
That sounds a lot like the battle net battle tags

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000
Just so you know like where you have like the

01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Name and then the random numbers at the end

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.000
So then also of course they've got

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:58.000
The Wii U chat stuff and they said that

01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.000
Of course you're going to be able to talk to each other

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.000
Using chat they say that

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.000
I guess users

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000
Will be able to draw images on the chat

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000
Window while they talk and

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.000
Instant hilarity

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.000
Just add cocks

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.000
Because you know

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.000
That's what's going to happen. What else are people

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.000
Going to draw on the screens?

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000
Like I'm going to have a video chat with

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:22.000
Loki and I'm going to draw a big dick

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000
Right next to his head and it'll be hilarious

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.000
I think that

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000
Photo I took at Fry's spells it out

01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:30.000
Which one is this?

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
The one where I walked by the monitor and there was a big

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:34.000
Dick on it that someone drew

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000
Of course

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:38.000
So yeah they have that stuff

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.000
Also they're saying that

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.000
That I guess people can

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.000
Place calls to each other through the Wii U chat

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.000
And there's going to be a light on the gamepad

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.000
They'll blink to indicate that there's an incoming

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:50.000
Call or something like that

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000
It just sounds like it's very basic stuff that they're

01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000
Just describing in a very complex way that

01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000
You know makes it sound like

01:21:56.000 --> 01:21:58.000
Oh hey look we've got video chat on our system

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000
Now that everybody's had

01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:02.000
This for years now but hey it's a new thing

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:04.000
And it's cutting edge because

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000
We're now doing it

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.000
And then of course also

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.000
They have the new Mii Plaza

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000
Which is now Mii Wara Wara

01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000
Or Wara Wara Plaza which I guess

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000
Wara Wara means bustling

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:18.000
In Japanese

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.000
Was it Wara Wara?

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000
Yes. Yeah that's going to change for the US

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Yeah it's

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
Well actually apparently

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
The English name will be the

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000
Wara Wara Plaza

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
I'm fine with that

01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:34.000
Which the distant cousin of

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
Wuhu Island

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
Which why can't it be Mii Plaza?

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000
Or the Wii U Plaza

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.000
Or the home screen

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.000
Or something like that

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.000
Why does it have to be something ridiculous?

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.000
No it should be Mii Gusta

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000
But anyways

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:52.000
Yeah so it looks like

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:54.000
Basically your Mii Plaza that you had had

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000
On the Wii

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Now there's titles that

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
You may have played in the Wii U games

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000
And stuff like that that they're huddling around

01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:04.000
Which

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000
I don't know

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000
I'm not that excited about

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.000
But whatever

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000
Not for me and also

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
Like they said before

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000
This is going to be a day one download so

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000
It won't actually come on your system

01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000
So if you don't have connection to the internet

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:22.000
Obviously you're not going to have any friends that are going to be on there

01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.000
Well if you don't have a connection to the internet you're probably not

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000
Going to be hearing this show

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000
Well you may have a connection at work

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000
Or something like that

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.000
I'm just saying

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:34.000
You may not have a connection to the internet at home

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000
Or you know your console

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000
May not be in an area

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Maybe you're in the dark ages and you don't have

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000
A wifi router or something like that

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000
Or it just doesn't work through

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Your walls or something

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000
You may have connectivity issues

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.000
Either way

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.000
So you're going to have to download this as a day one

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:54.000
And I believe the internet browser

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.000
Is going to be part of that

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000
So

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.000
Well

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000
Moving on into other news

01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000
About Valve

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000
I know we're all excited about whatever Valve's got

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.000
Going on next even though we have no idea what it could possibly be

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:10.000
Although I think we're all hoping it's like Half Life 3

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:12.000
Maybe

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
Gabe Newell apparently got a visit

01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:16.000
This past week from

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
A bunch of users from 4chan.org

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
Uh oh

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000
But the Vboard

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.000
Specifically went to go visit Gabe Newell

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
For his birthday

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
That's pretty hilarious

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000
And asked him some questions

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000
And of course there's YouTubes of it all over the internet

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000
Newell did say no Half Life 3 questions

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
So that wasn't out there

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.000
But that doesn't mean they couldn't get some other questions

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:40.000
Such as is Valve working on a new

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Source engine

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000
And Newell said we've been working on a new engine stuff for a while

01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000
There was some

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:48.000
Garbled audio with subtitles that say

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:50.000
We've just been waiting for a game to roll it out with

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.000
And uh

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.000
There was another question asked saying

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.000
Is it more than just an extension to Source

01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:58.000
Like is it an entirely new engine

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000
And Gabe Newell said

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.000
Yeah

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.000
Apparently the rumor mill's still

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Pumping out there on Source 2

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
This is after the uncovered code in August

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Wouldn't Source 2 be awesome

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
For like you know launching a console

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.000
That they would be making themselves

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Perhaps with a game called Half Life 3

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.000
That would sell a lot of consoles

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000
Or you know whatever they're gonna be

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
I want Half Life Ponies

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Well the game they are making is Ricochet 2

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
That was something that Gabe Newell did confirm

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
Is in development

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Maybe that's the first game on the engine

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000
That could be the game for 2014

01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000
Who knows

01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:36.000
Alright let's move on with some more news

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:38.000
Dark Sakura

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
Oh Square

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:42.000
Oh Square

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.000
We need sad music

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:46.000
I don't know

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.000
What about Aerith dying music

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Alright we can do

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
Alright I'll get some sad music

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.000
But that's happy music for me

01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000
Aerith living

01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000
Aerith living

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:00.000
Aerith living music I don't know

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Yeah well Aerith dying music was happy for me

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000
Because I hated her

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.000
Should just be the sound of the sword

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
Shink shink

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Ten hours of

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:12.000
That's better

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:14.000
That's better

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
So Final Fantasy 14

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Has come to an end

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
Dun dun dun

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:22.000
And um

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000
Yeah instead of

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000
Some of the stuff that people were promised

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:28.000
What they had was basically

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
Server farting

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
They got a really nice cinematic

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
I'm just imagining

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
I'm just imagining actual

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
Literal server farting

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
This is the end

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
Oh well this is

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
Unexpected

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000
You shouldn't be making fart noises

01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:48.000
Over this very sad song

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.000
This is happy music

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Remember vote for us at the podcast awards

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.000
Yay she's

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
Dead awesome

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
My favorite part

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
My save file still works by the way

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:08.000
Anyway

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.000
People were basically

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.000
Logging on you

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000
Those few loyal

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Deluded people who were still

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
Into the game Hey I have friends that were still playing

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Final Fantasy 14

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
You like what you like

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
I can't make fun of anybody this week

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000
Because I've popped so many squares

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
On that curiosity cube

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000
I can't judge anybody I'm sorry

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.000
What was the line from

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.000
Money Python? Don't know much about art

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000
But I know what I like

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000
So

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
I'm just going to read the quote

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
From one of the players

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
There were so many waiting to

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.000
Log in and fight in the promised epic battles

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.000
That Square Enix had to start

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.000
Turning players away based on subscription

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
End date

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
So those who were in had bad lag

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
Especially in menus and couldn't

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Form parties

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
When they actually did get

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000
To fight some of these epic

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000
Monsters they were promised

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
They were

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:08.000
It was like these

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Level 100 monsters that were only ever

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Seen in cutscenes

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.000
They really couldn't get much

01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000
About it so basically the last server message

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.000
Just pretty much bleeped over and over

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Again

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Confound contact with main host

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
What a way to go

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
Yeah but there's a pretty nice

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Cinematic up on Kotaku so go watch that

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000
That's the only good thing to ever come out of Final Fantasy 14

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
Actually by pretty nice

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.000
Pretty fucking amazing

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.000
If you do watch the mag it's pretty epic

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.000
I'm very curious about

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
This realm reborn

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000
I can't believe they went so far

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:44.000
As to just pull the fucking plug on 14

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.000
As it was and saying alright

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Hold up you guys we got this

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.000
Just give us about 6 months to get it up and running again

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.000
Crazy

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000
Alright we'll just do a real

01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.000
Update this time instead of just

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
Poopooing out something

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
Alright well we'll see what happens

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
If it was worth the wait or if it is

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Poopoo

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
In the meantime something a little closer

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
To look forward to this week's release dates

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000
Oh my god

01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000
There's a little bit happening in the states this week

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.000
Just a tad

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000
Bit considering that we've got the Wii U

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000
Launched so there's like every god damn

01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Game coming out on the Wii U

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000
All at one time let's talk about the big stuff

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000
First of course obviously

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
The biggest game of the year

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
And this is probably by sales this is not

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
Necessarily unpopularity but it is pretty popular

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
As well Call of Duty Black Ops 2

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
Very popular of course the Care Package

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
And

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000
Hardened editions of that as well

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000
Coming out this week

01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.000
And the Care Package with that quadcopter

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
Which looks cool

01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:56.000
But I guarantee is very cheap

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
Cause they usually

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000
Forget who they source to make that stuff

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
But it's been the same company each year

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000
They make kids toys folks

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:06.000

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
I think that's it

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000

Apparently they have a double pack of the UFC

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.000
games so they've got UFC 3

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000

Not the cool Wipeout 3

01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.000
but the one based off the TV show that no one cares about

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:38.000
Funky Barnum

01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:40.000
There was a TV show

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
It's like a Takashi's castle

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:44.000
but Americanized

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:46.000
It's not good, don't worry about it

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:48.000
That's awful

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000

There was just an entire

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
wall filled with

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000
all that stuff

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.000
Dang, they are making bank off

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.000
Whoever thought of that

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:08.000
idea to charge people

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.000

01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.000
that's gonna get

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:28.000
I can't wait to own it all

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
I'm gonna be one of those mothers

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
banging down the McDonald's door

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000
Alright, let's go

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
There's a lot of talk in our chat room

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
I want to acknowledge the chat at live.vognetwork.com

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
kind of talking about Final Fantasy 14

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
to Jamie's story

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:36.000
Stan in chat asks

01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000
So Final Fantasy 14 is completely dead now

01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:40.000
or is reborn replacing it?

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.000
The latter, reborn is replacing it

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.000
and yes, 14 is dead now

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:46.000
There is this gap happening

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:48.000
and YYR mentions it a little earlier in chat

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:50.000
with, what did he say?

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.000
They're really going to have to start over

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.000
Shouldn't they have wanted to at least retain

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:56.000
the small audience they had?

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000
They are hoping they'll come back

01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
and I think the ones that were

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
loyal to 14 until the very end

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
I think they will come back

01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000
I mean, for them to have held out on that game that long

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000
they'll come back

01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000
Here's my prediction for the whole thing

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.000
I'll come back when they make 11

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
free to play

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:16.000
I'll withhold judgement until I see it

01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:18.000
You know, if 14

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000
the real one

01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:22.000
which is really what this is now

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:24.000
I know they're calling it reborn

01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.000
but they want us to see it as Final Fantasy 14

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.000
No, really this time

01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000
If it's a good game, then it's a good game

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:32.000
and I've got to play a good game, right?

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
We'll see

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
Alright, anyhow, moving to

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:38.000
Japan and the releases over there

01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:40.000
there's quite a bit over there as well

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000
Assassin's Creed 3 gets its Japanese release on the 15th

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000
Some Platinum Collection titles

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000
Dance Central connects sports, including

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:48.000
Season 2 and what they call the Ultimate Collection

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.000
which is both

01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.000
Need for Speed Most Wanted gets a Criterion

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
release, Nike and Connect

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:56.000
Training and Steins Gate

01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000
Hiyoko Ruri no Darling

01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000
also gets a price reduction as well

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.000
so lots of price reductions and

01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000
Assassin's Creed 3, just in time for

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:06.000
the holidays. On the Playstation 3

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.000
also Assassin's Creed 3

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:10.000
Need for Speed Most Wanted and

01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000
Dream Club Complete

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:14.000
Edi Pion gets a release

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.000
that's from D3 on the Playstation 3

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
Going to the handhelds on the

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
Playstation Vita, Assassin's Creed 3

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000
Lady Liberty is there, as well

01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:24.000
as a Need for Speed Most Wanted release

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:26.000
and some new Vita

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:28.000
packs are coming out

01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:30.000
the 3G Wi-Fi model

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
in Cosmic Red and Sapphire Blue

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:34.000
I remember reading about those earlier

01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000
those are finally seeing their release in Japan this week

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:38.000
so if you've been waiting for that pretty blue

01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:40.000
PS Vita, Shane, there it is

01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:42.000
On the

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:44.000
3DS

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.000
Aikatsu Cinderella lesson

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.000
comes out

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
I don't know what lesson they'll be teaching

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.000
Clean the toilets!

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.000
Change the firewood!

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:56.000
It's a game to teach you how to clean your house

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:58.000
That'd be hilarious

01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:00.000
On the 3DS

01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:02.000
Clean your house, or else no man will love you

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:04.000
Stop it

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000
Unchained Blades Exiv comes out

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Inazuma 11-123

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000
Endou Mamoru Densetsu

01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000
and Monster Hunter 3G

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
gets a price reduction

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
that might be of interest to some people

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
Now, I'm looking at this and I don't think

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
this is like Cinderella like the fairy tale

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.000
This girl dressed up

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.000
in the little Playboy bunny outfit and pink

01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:26.000
skirt, that's not what I think of

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:28.000
and I think of Cinderella

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:30.000
It looks like overtly shoujo manga style

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.000
Yeah, so I don't think

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.000
Disney Cinderella

01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000
I'm thinking something else

01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Isn't the lesson still the same?

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000
Cinderella's lesson was if you want that man

01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000
you go get him

01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.000
And you take lots of drugs

01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000
so you think that you're being

01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000
met by fairy godmothers

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000
There's no Q

01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:22.000
16th we have Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
and Sims 3 The Seasons

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:26.000
You know what?

01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:28.000
I quit Sims 3 after World Adventures

01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000
because I had way too much

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000
custom content that it lagged my game

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000
It was really

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:36.000
El Cubo is the re-release

01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:38.000
of the GameCube, the Latin America version

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.000
For England

01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:42.000
Well

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.000
they like to mix it up a bit

01:39:44.000 --> 01:39:46.000
Somehow I don't think that's Castilian

01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000
Spanish

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000
Hey, I may be an expert in Spanish

01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:52.000
but that sounds pretty sound to me

01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.000
El anything

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
is Spanish

01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:58.000
It could be Portuguese

01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000
It could be

01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000
Or it could be

01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.000
Moving On With More News, the classic game of the week

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000
coming up real soon

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
Alright

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:10.000
As I kind of alluded to earlier

01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:12.000
with the need to sell some of those

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.000
combo packs for UFC

01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:16.000
THQ is not doing real well

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.000
In fact you may remember that

01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000
a while ago they actually had

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.000
unsplit

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:24.000
their stocks, a reverse

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000
stock split, 10 to 1

01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000
taking all their, you know, 51 cent

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000
share stocks and

01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:32.000
combining them together to equal

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000
$5.16 share

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000
stocks

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:38.000
You know, because their stock price

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.000
fell so low that it was going to be delisted

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000
Problem is

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000
Now their stock has dropped

01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:46.000
down to $1.74

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.000
42%

01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:50.000
So

01:40:50.000 --> 01:40:52.000
If you think about it

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
those stocks really wouldn't be worth crap

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
They'd be worth like $0.17

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.000
Good times

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:00.000
Good times, yeah

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.000
So that is unfortunate

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.000
And of course I'm sure it's not helping by the fact that

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:06.000
a lot of those

01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:08.000
games have kind of

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.000
You know, oh I'm sorry

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.000
It closed down to $1.50

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.000
It dropped even further

01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:16.000
So 50%

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:18.000
It's probably not helping that a lot of the games

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.000
that they were going to be coming out with

01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:22.000
have been delayed

01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:24.000
I understand why they're doing it

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:26.000
It's admirable

01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.000
but at the same time

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:30.000
I'm kind of wondering

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.000
Damn, I hope you guys survive

01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:34.000
all these delays

01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:36.000
Well what's interesting, Legend of Zaku in our chatroom

01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:38.000
at live.vognetwork.com says

01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000
Seriously, they'll be dead in six months

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000
But Shadow Next Gen follows that up with

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000
people said that six months ago

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000
That's true, and the whole thing now

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
is that they want to

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
focus on quality, which is great

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
So South Park, Metro Last Light, and

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000
Company of Heroes 2 have all been delayed

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000
to the next fiscal year

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
So that doesn't necessarily mean that

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000
they're not coming out, it just means that they're

01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000
delayed a few months

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000
because originally this stuff was supposed to come out in the first quarter

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000
of 2013

01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000
and even as

01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000
I alluded to

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000
they were saying

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000
When I joined THQ, the company made a public commitment

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000
to the quality of titles

01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000
and we've always expected that

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000
in some cases this would mean that more time

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000
would be needed to make sure that every title

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000
is of the highest possible quality

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000
and our fourth quarter releases

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000
are the first titles that I have

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000
that have the ability to

01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000
materially impact an experience

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000
told me that

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000
games needed additional

01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000
development time to be market ready

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000
Thank you for releasing games that

01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000
are polished as opposed to

01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000
just putting them out there because

01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000
eh, we won't make money

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000
So let's hope that that actually

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000
pays off and these games are even

01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000
better than what they would have been had they just

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000
put them out when they were

01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000
ready to put them out

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
So we'll see

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000
However, that's still not helping the fact that they

01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
defaulted on their 50 million dollar loan

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000
that they had

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000
with Wells Fargo

01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000
So, not

01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000
too good

01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:13.000
Sad trombone

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:15.000
Yes, so apparently they had

01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:17.000
borrowed I guess 21 million

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000
dollars from the credit that they had

01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000
and

01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000
I guess they had like this 50 million

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
dollar revolving credit and

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
yeah, not good

01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
so

01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000
Hopefully they will be able to

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000
recoup from all these losses and stuff

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000
and put out some good games

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000
I mean after all, South Park looks awesome

01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000
I'm not a big fan of Company of Heroes

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:41.000
but Metro Last Light looks pretty sweet

01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:43.000
And you need a Saints Row 4

01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Right? That's what Rama in our chat room

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.000
just said

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:49.000
Rama in the chat, they better

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.000
give me my Saints Row 4 before

01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.000
they go down like the claims

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Saints Row, you know

01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
what they were planning to do with that, the whole

01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
enter the dominatrix thing, which to be honest

01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:01.000
looked like shit

01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:03.000
I would have still bought it, but it still looks like shit

01:44:03.000 --> 01:44:05.000
but they're making a fourth

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:07.000
game that's supposed to be better

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:09.000
but at the same time they're saying they're kind of incorporating

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:11.000
all the stuff that was going to be in Saints Row

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:13.000
you know, enter the dominatrix

01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:15.000
so it makes me worry that Saints Row

01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:17.000
4 is going to just kind of feel like an expansion

01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:19.000
on 3, which

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
not different enough for me, but I still

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
will buy it because I like Saints Row

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:25.000
but I will still be pissed off if it's just

01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.000
a cash grab like the other

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:29.000
games have been, but hopefully they kind of learn from their

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.000
lesson, or didn't learn from their lesson because they made a lot

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:33.000
of money off of all the DLC

01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:35.000
Alright, let's move on to some

01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.000
announcements from Blizzard, who also had an earnings

01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000
call this week, Starcraft

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.000
2 Heart of the Swarm, this expansion

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.000
they've been working on for quite a while

01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:45.000
is finally due out in the first

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
half of 2013

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:49.000
that's according to Mike Morhaime, who is the head

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.000
of Blizzard, he did make that announcement during

01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:53.000
Activision's earnings call, saying that they are

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:55.000
quote, working hard towards a first half

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.000
2013 launch, that wouldn't be

01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:59.000
too surprising to anyone who's been following Blizzard

01:44:59.000 --> 01:45:01.000
for a while, they put out two big games

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
this year already between Diablo 3 and

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
Mists of Pandaria, so them

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:07.000
holding onto this for 2013 is no

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:09.000
surprise at all, I would think though it's

01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:11.000
going to happen after the end of the fiscal quarter

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:13.000
to give them something to buoy up the next

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:15.000
fiscal year, but we'll see

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:17.000
we'll see, speaking of Diablo

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:19.000
3, they have surpassed 10 million

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:21.000
sold, and it was confirmed

01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:23.000
to I'm sure no one's surprise

01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:25.000
an expansion for Diablo 3

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.000
is in the works, I'd be

01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000
very curious to see how that expansion

01:45:29.000 --> 01:45:31.000
does though, because let's not forget a lot of those

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:33.000
Diablo 3's, well, maybe that's not

01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.000
I was going to say a lot, but it's more like

01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
a million came through that annual

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
pass, and I guess 1 million out of 10 million

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:41.000
still 10% is pretty

01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000
you know, but I'd be very curious

01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:45.000
Diablo 3 hasn't exactly had the warmest

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:47.000
reception either, it has its

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000
fans, certainly, but I

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000
just don't hear about it the same way

01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.000
I heard the enthusiasm for Diablo 2

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.000
and I know some Diablo fans might want to challenge

01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:57.000
me on that, and that's fine, but I just

01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000
I don't hear that same enthusiasm

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:01.000
that I heard behind part 2

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.000
so I'd be very curious how an expansion is going to do

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
for them, but I'm sure

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:07.000
it would be as well received as Starcraft 2

01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.000
I mean, Starcraft 2 also, you know

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:11.000
it's popular, but not popular

01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:13.000
like Starcraft 1 was

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.000
does that make sense? I don't know

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
also, a class action

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
lawsuit being filed against

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:21.000
Blizzard

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:23.000
you know, they make World of Warcraft

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:25.000
Starcraft, Diablo 3, and it has to

01:46:25.000 --> 01:46:27.000
do with the authenticators

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:29.000
apparently

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:31.000
who are the guys that are

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:33.000
filing this lawsuit here?

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
it's

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
Carney, William Bates, Pullum

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:39.000
and Bowman PLLC

01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:41.000
they are litigating Benjamin

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.000
Bell et al. versus Blizzard

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.000
Entertainment, saying that

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.000
all of this is negligent and deceptive

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.000
practices related to

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:51.000
Blizzard's customers' account security

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:53.000
the fact that for a while

01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:55.000
you had to buy a keychain

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.000
authenticator for $6.50

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:59.000
technically you still do have to buy that

01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:01.000
authenticator if you really want to protect your account

01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:03.000
however, what I'm not hearing about

01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:05.000
in this lawsuit is, oh yeah, there's the

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:07.000
free one on the smartphones

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.000
and so forth. Don't they have a PC app now?

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:11.000
I don't think so, just on smartphones

01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000
maybe, I don't know

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
I've had the smartphone one for so long, I don't know

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:17.000
the claim is drawing

01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:19.000
against the August 9th

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000
battle net breach

01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:23.000
where Blizzard, they actually

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
disclosed that yes, people got in

01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.000
they didn't get any sensitive information

01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.000
but were making people reset their passwords

01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:31.000
anyways, and the

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.000
lawsuit saying that Blizzard's negligence

01:47:33.000 --> 01:47:35.000
in maintaining proper

01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000
security protocols is resulting

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:39.000
in deceptive upselling

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:41.000
so in other words, because Blizzard

01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.000
can't protect their shit, or is

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.000
negligent in protecting their shit, they're selling

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:47.000
you an authenticator so that

01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:49.000
they're making you buy this to protect

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000
your shit. That's gonna get thrown out because

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.000
honestly, my

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.000
I've had an authenticator

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000
for years and it hasn't done

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000
a damn thing for

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000
anyone getting it and getting any information

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
that had, the authenticator

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:05.000
had nothing to do with it

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.000
it wasn't

01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:09.000
like, I think that

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:11.000
they got encrypted data

01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:13.000
was it nothing solid? And it was anything

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.000
that could have been changed immediately

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:17.000
that wouldn't have changed his present level of

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
security. Well, here's the thing though

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:21.000
I mean, as much as I do think

01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:23.000
I agree with you, it's gonna get thrown out of court

01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:25.000
but I would like to know

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:27.000
why were so many Blizzard

01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000
accounts hacked before authenticators

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:31.000
before the mobile authenticator

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000
came out? Because there was about a year gap

01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000
where you only had the

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:37.000
$6.50 ones, and as a Warcraft

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000
player, I did feel like

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.000
why are they making me buy an

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:43.000
authenticator when they can't protect my shit?

01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:45.000
You know, and I was like

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000
why are so many people getting hacked? What happened

01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.000
here? How did all our passwords get out?

01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:51.000
I kinda would like that to come to light

01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:53.000
I would like to know, how many million people

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:55.000
have had to call Blizzard because of an account breach?

01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:57.000
Granted, I think

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.000
that the authenticator was more put out as something

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.000
that was for peace of mind

01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.000
because I've done remote work

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.000
where I had to have an onsite

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.000
authenticator to get into the server

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.000
so it's basically an added

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:11.000
layer of protection on

01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:13.000
user side. I think that

01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:15.000
it doesn't really matter

01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:17.000
how much security you

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.000
have on the website. If someone wants to get in, they're gonna

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.000
get in. So this

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:23.000
basically just gives you an extra

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.000
layer.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:27.000
If anything, I would think that the authenticator price

01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:29.000
was just to cover the cost of the actual authenticator

01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:31.000
I don't think they were actually profiting off of it because

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
it was

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.000
something that required having

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:37.000
a device

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:39.000
in your hands to basically

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.000
pair the random numbers

01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000
with so

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:45.000
it's not like something that you

01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:47.000
obviously, once smartphones

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000
came out to the masses

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000
and everything like that, they could do an app

01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:53.000
instead but

01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:55.000
that's probably why they had to sell it in the first place

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:57.000
because they don't want to lose $6.50 on every single

01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:59.000
one they send out for people. Granted

01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:01.000
it didn't seem to help for it. They should have just

01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000
included it in the collector's edition though

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000
I don't know, I don't understand why they just didn't

01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.000
include it. Did they do that actually in some of them? No.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:09.000
I thought that they had one of the expansions that had an

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000
authenticator in there. I don't think it was

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000
Warcraft.

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:15.000
Might have been Starcraft, but I don't remember.

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:17.000
I don't know, they were just handing them out at cons.

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000
Yeah, but that's different.

01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.000
Alright, anyhow, we need to

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:23.000
take a time back into

01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:25.000
classic gaming and classic games history

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:27.000
and remember when things weren't so

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.000
simple and so much shit was getting hacked.

01:50:29.000 --> 01:50:31.000
At least I don't think this game

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:33.000
ever got hacked.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000
It stole your credit card information.

01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:37.000
It's the classic game of the week.

01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000
Every week DarkSakura goes into the vault

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.000
and finds a classic game that she thinks, hey

01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:43.000
you little brats.

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
This one smells like rotten fruit. Play this game

01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:47.000
or I'll kill you.

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:49.000
Get off my lawn. Go play a game.

01:50:49.000 --> 01:50:51.000
I'll kill you like you're Eris.

01:50:51.000 --> 01:50:53.000
Eris.

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:55.000
Hey, even in Wreck-It Ralph

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.000
they got it right. Murica.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.000
In

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.000
Murica we say Eris.

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
Alright, what is the classic game of the week?

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Super Pac-Man.

01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:07.000
I like this one.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:09.000
I'm surprised I haven't done it because I actually

01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:11.000
really like Super Pac-Man.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:13.000
Actually the thing that I linked is basically

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.000
someone figuring out the ghost patterns in the game.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.000
And totally manipulating

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
a full game.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.000
But anyway

01:51:21.000 --> 01:51:23.000
in Super Pac-Man it was

01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.000
the second game

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000
in the series that was actually done by

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000
Namco. Ms. Pac-Man

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:31.000
was done by Midway.

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.000
So this is a true

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:35.000
Namco sequel

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000
but you know people didn't really care

01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:39.000
for it as much because it changed the gameplay

01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.000
really radically.

01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000
It actually

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000
in the game you actually went around

01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:47.000
and ate fruit.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.000
Instead of the little power pills.

01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000
And then you did get

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:53.000
special pellets.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:55.000
You had your

01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:57.000
regular power pills which you could use to

01:51:57.000 --> 01:51:59.000
eat ghosts. You had keys

01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000
that you could get to unlock doors

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:03.000
so that you could get to the fruits

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.000
inside. And then

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:07.000
you had super pellets. And if you got the super

01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000
pellet then you would turn into Super

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:11.000
Pac-Man and could go through doors and fly

01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:13.000
over everything. And you had a button

01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000
that would make you go faster.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:17.000
On top of that

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:19.000
there was a little neat, I thought it was a

01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.000
neat little effect where the ghosts would kind of flatten

01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:23.000
down a bit to make it look like you were really

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:25.000
flying over them.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:27.000
Now

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:29.000
you could not eat a ghost

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000
as Super Pac-Man

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:33.000
but if you ate a power pill

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.000
like a regular power pill

01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000
while you were

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000
in super mode then you could eat ghosts.

01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:43.000
The big thing about

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.000
that is you also had bonus

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.000
levels too after every

01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000
second level. Where basically you just try

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000
to go through and eat the fruit and everything

01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000
as fast as you can.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000
With this one

01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.000
it's actually one

01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.000
of the first Pac-Man games

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.000
that used the Motorola 6809 processor.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000
The previous one used the

01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:05.000
Z80. And so this went

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:07.000
into the same category as

01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:09.000
Galaxian for the conversion class.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:13.000
However, it didn't

01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:15.000
really prove to be very successful

01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:17.000
because it was actually

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:19.000
very different than the usual

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000
gameplay. It was kind of fucking weird actually.

01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:23.000
It was. Pac-Man Plus

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:25.000
which was just an updated version of the original

01:53:25.000 --> 01:53:27.000
I mean kind of like Ms. Pac-Man

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:29.000
basically

01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.000
outsold it. Midway also

01:53:31.000 --> 01:53:33.000
did Junior Pac-Man which

01:53:33.000 --> 01:53:35.000
also went on the old Z80

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:37.000
processor and

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000
that one also went to be a very

01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:41.000
successful Pac-Man game.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.000
However, they do say that the AI

01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:45.000
for Super Pac-Man is

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:47.000
one of the best of that time.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:49.000
Super

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.000
Pac-Man has been out on a lot of

01:53:51.000 --> 01:53:53.000
different systems. In 84 there was

01:53:53.000 --> 01:53:55.000
a port for the Atari 5200

01:53:55.000 --> 01:53:57.000
but it never came out because

01:53:57.000 --> 01:53:59.000
the video game crashed. Why is he eating shoes

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.000
in this level? You don't eat shoes. I don't

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:03.000
know. I get the donuts and the burgers

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000
and the apples but shoes?

01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:07.000
Don't eat shoes. Leather.

01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.000
In

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.000
1988 there was a Dawson Commodore 64

01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:13.000
version that came out by Thunder Mountain.

01:54:13.000 --> 01:54:15.000
Did you have this file? F yeah.

01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000
In

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000
96 it showed up

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000
on the A for the Namco

01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Museum arcade compilation

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:25.000
on the Playstation. In 98

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:27.000
it came out for Namco History volume 3

01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:29.000
and that was

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:31.000
on the PC in Japan only. In 99

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:33.000
Super Pac-Man was released

01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000
with Ms. Pac-Man in Ms. Pac-Man

01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000
Special Color Edition for the Game Boy Color.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:39.000
I had that. I played the crap out of it.

01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.000
2006

01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:43.000
there was a plug and play Super Pac-Man

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000
that included that along with

01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000
Pac-Man, Pac-Man Plus, and Pac and Pal

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:49.000
which honestly Pac and Pal is seriously

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.000
not one of my favorites.

01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:53.000
It also

01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:55.000
came in the TV Games Pac-Man

01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:57.000
Gold edition and the Retro Arcade.

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:59.000
Namco has also done

01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:01.000
a portable version for cell phones

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
that come out on

01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:05.000
that are put out by Sprint.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:07.000
Sprint and Namco actually

01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:09.000
had a sweepstakes where you could win

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:11.000
a Volkswagen new Beetle customized

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000
Super Pac-Man art and

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:15.000
it was on display at E3 in 2006.

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:17.000
Do you remember this?

01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:19.000
The Beetle with the

01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:21.000
Super Pac-Man stuff? I do.

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.000
Yeah.

01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:25.000
It ended

01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:27.000
on July 31, 2006.

01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:29.000
There was a Palm PDA version

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:31.000
that was Super Pac-Man at Handango.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:33.000
Whatever.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.000
There was another

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.000
release with Pac and Pal, Pac and Roll, and Pac-Mania

01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000
on Namco Museum

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000
Remix.

01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000
Super Pac-Man is now out

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:45.000
on mobile films with 3D graphics

01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:47.000
and better sound effects.

01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:49.000
And then we have it on the Namco Museum Virtual Arcade

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:51.000
for Xbox 360 that came out in 2008.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:53.000
So there you go.

01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:55.000
Super Pac-Man. There it is, your classic

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:57.000
game of the week, Super Pac-Man.

01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:59.000
I liked this one, even though it was really weird.

01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:01.000
It was weird. I liked it.

01:56:01.000 --> 01:56:03.000
You know how I feel about

01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:05.000
weird. I love that cut scene.

01:56:05.000 --> 01:56:07.000
He's like, grin.

01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:09.000
Where a giant ball of

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000
Pac-Man falls on the ghost, they turn blue and squish.

01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000
Don't eat mushrooms! Some of them are

01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:15.000
poisonous! But what if they're shiitake?

01:56:15.000 --> 01:56:17.000
Shiitake are delicious. I guess that's alright.

01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.000
I made the best dinner that was

01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:21.000
shiitake mushrooms, enoki mushrooms,

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:23.000
and, um,

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:25.000
I can't remember, but

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:27.000
there are these other little mushrooms that kind of join at the base

01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:29.000
and you have to cut the base off. It was so good, anyway.

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.000
The front lawn mushrooms.

01:56:31.000 --> 01:56:33.000
No, not front lawn mushrooms.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.000
Alright, anyhow.

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000
Alright, Super Pac-Man,

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:39.000
your classic game of the week,

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:41.000
in a million different Namco

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
collections, as Jamie mentioned

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:45.000
there a little bit ago.

01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:47.000
We're actually not taking a break tonight.

01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000
We have another interview,

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:51.000
and this one's prior taped.

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:53.000
This is actually coming to us from

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.000
DJ Rama S,

01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000
and Anime Jam Session,

01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000
which is a show you can hear at the Voice

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000
of Geeks Network, or vognetwork.com,

01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:03.000
on Tuesday nights, replaying

01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:05.000
on Thursday mornings, and

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000
at a recent convention,

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:09.000
Rama got this interview with

01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:11.000
Jen, and she is with

01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:13.000
the website, I don't want to

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
mess this up, it's ggvogue.com

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
ggvogue.com

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000
That is girl gamer

01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000
vogue, and Rama is gonna

01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000
ask her in this interview some questions about

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
the website, and why she started

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000
it, and all that good stuff, so

01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000
take it away. DJ Rama S will be back

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000
after this interview with more of

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000
Orange Lounge Radio. It's about a ten minute interview,

01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000
so we'll be back after this.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.000
Absolutely, we definitely try to get

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:05.000
girls from all over the tri-state area

01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.000
to kind of just get together,

01:58:07.000 --> 01:58:09.000
to meet other girls, to find other venues

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.000
and genres that they play with,

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000
and just to have an atmosphere and a community

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.000
that they feel pretty proud and comfortable

01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:17.000
in. Our

01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000
number one passion and mission

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.000
is to just provide

01:58:21.000 --> 01:58:23.000
a wonderful atmosphere for girl gamers

01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.000
and empower and inspire them actually,

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:27.000
because ultimately, we

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:29.000
girls need that community,

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:31.000
we need to find

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.000
other girls who play games

01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:35.000
and just play.

01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:37.000
That sounds pretty cool, so what

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.000
made you come up with this whole idea?

01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:41.000
To be honest, I've

01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:43.000
been gaming ever since I was like five.

01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:45.000
I remember having an

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.000
NES and just playing it,

01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:49.000
and it was actually taken away from me by my uncle,

01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:51.000
but I was really

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.000
a hardcore Sega fan. I'm a hardcore

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:55.000
Sega fan, up until the Dreamcast when it

01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:57.000
actually kind of just fell off the face of the earth.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:59.000
I mean, now they're more of a software company,

01:58:59.000 --> 01:59:01.000
but I always realized and remembered

01:59:01.000 --> 01:59:03.000
feeling that I never

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000
had a girl that I could always play with.

01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:07.000
I went to an all-girls school, up into

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.000
high school, and I never

01:59:09.000 --> 01:59:11.000
had the companionship, and

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:13.000
I saw that the world lacked that,

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.000
a place where you could find that companionship.

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:17.000
It's like, yeah, you can go to forums,

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:19.000
but there isn't a specific venue that you can

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:21.000
kind of just find a girl

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.000
that is looking for a Guild Wars 2

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:25.000
Guild mate, or

01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:27.000
even if it's just Call of Duty.

01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:29.000
That sounds pretty cool.

01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:31.000
So what makes Girl Game Evolved

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:33.000
different from other female

01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:35.000
gamer clans like the D20 girls

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:37.000
or something like that?

01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:39.000
It makes it kind of different.

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:41.000
Well, we're not a clan, per se.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:43.000
We're a means to an end,

01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:45.000
if anything. If you're looking for a clan,

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.000
if you're looking for a friend,

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:49.000
we're the place that you would go to

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:51.000
in order to find that clan.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:53.000
So you're pretty much like the liaison

01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.000
to connect other gaming girls

01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:57.000
to other groups and

01:59:57.000 --> 01:59:59.000
clans and teams and so forth.

01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:01.000
Okay. I mean, the

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:03.000
website is pretty much kind of like a

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:05.000
magazine. We do previews and reviews of

02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:07.000
games. We do video games psychology, so we

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:09.000
teach girls about other

02:00:09.000 --> 02:00:11.000
types of genre games, so if you're not

02:00:11.000 --> 02:00:13.000
familiar with First Person Shooter, we

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:15.000
kind of talk about that. We also

02:00:15.000 --> 02:00:17.000
do kind of like

02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:19.000
101 gaming for moms,

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.000
so if you're a mom out there and your child

02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:23.000
is a son or a daughter who's really into

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
games, we teach you about the ESRB

02:00:25.000 --> 02:00:27.000
rating. We teach you about what games are

02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:29.000
good for your child. We also talk

02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:31.000
about games you can play as

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:33.000
a mom who's not very familiar with games as well.

02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:35.000
That sounds pretty

02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:37.000
cool. So how long have you

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:39.000
been running this organization?

02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:41.000
Officially, it's been running since

02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:43.000
November 2011, but

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:45.000
it's always been a dream and a passion ever since

02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.000
I can remember.

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:49.000
So where do you see this

02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:51.000
site going? What's your vision

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:53.000
for it?

02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:55.000
To be honest with anything,

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:57.000
I don't have any expectations

02:00:57.000 --> 02:00:59.000
when it comes to this. It's kind of just like

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:01.000
I want to do more.

02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.000
We definitely want to be able to just

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:05.000
bring more women and more girls and

02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:07.000
more gamers into this community because

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.000
we want to become

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:11.000
a positive

02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:13.000
representation of the gaming community

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.000
because in actuality, that's

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:17.000
how the gaming community started. It started

02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:19.000
out with gamers

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:21.000
very passionate about their hobbies

02:01:21.000 --> 02:01:23.000
and promoting it.

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:25.000
Right now, I'm not

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.000
going to say it's unbalanced, but I feel like there's

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:29.000
not a lot of representations for females.

02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:31.000
There's not a lot of places that they can go

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:33.000
to to either A.

02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:35.000
get the kind of news feeds they want

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:37.000
or B. get the kind of

02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:39.000
information they need.

02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.000
We talk about video game fashion and

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:43.000
we talk about this is actually

02:01:43.000 --> 02:01:45.000
a Legend of Zelda

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:47.000
Fire from Ocarina of Time.

02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:49.000
It's a jewel, but it's been made out of a necklace.

02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:51.000
We showcase things like that because

02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:53.000
they're important.

02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.000
Particularly a girl, if she wanted to

02:01:55.000 --> 02:01:57.000
buy that, she could be able to

02:01:57.000 --> 02:01:59.000
find it on our website.

02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:01.000
That's pretty cool. I like that

02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:03.000
concept. I just like

02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:05.000
the idea of it and what

02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:07.000
you're working with and

02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:09.000
where it's going so far.

02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:11.000
Outside of this, what kind of games

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:13.000
do you like to play?

02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:15.000
Right now,

02:02:15.000 --> 02:02:17.000
I'm playing Guild Wars 2

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:19.000
and I love Guild Wars 2 because

02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:21.000
I played Aeon and World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy

02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.000
and I played LOL.

02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000
It's just

02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:27.000
I love, I don't like

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:29.000
the I hit you, you

02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.000
hit me kind of gaming.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:33.000
I actually write for Game Tire and I wrote

02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:35.000
an article about the top 15 qualities

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
for an MMORPG

02:02:37.000 --> 02:02:39.000
and Guild Wars 2

02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:41.000
just seems to be nailing 85

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.000
to 90% of anything that I was

02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:45.000
asking for an MMORPG.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:47.000
Granted, it's not like WoW.

02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000
WoW will always, I mean like the

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.000
end game is just

02:02:51.000 --> 02:02:53.000
like the end game like Instance and Raids

02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:55.000
and World of Warcraft.

02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.000
You can't get that in Guild Wars 2 but

02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:59.000
Guild Wars 2 has just so much

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:01.000
more opportunities for you to explore.

02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:03.000
You get

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:05.000
points and you get rewarding experiences

02:03:05.000 --> 02:03:07.000
for helping out and I feel like

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:09.000
Guild Wars 2 actually has this social aspect.

02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:11.000
I play

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.000
mostly PS3 and PS2 and PS1

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:15.000
games, I ain't no Sony fan, but

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:17.000
I'm completely a diehard Sega fan.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:19.000
I still have my Sega Dreamcast, I still have my Gensys.

02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:21.000
I didn't get a Saturn but I do

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:23.000
have a Game Gear.

02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:25.000
But do you also have a Master System?

02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:27.000
I don't have a Master System.

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.000
We might have to get her a Master System.

02:03:29.000 --> 02:03:31.000
I would love a Master System.

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:33.000
I might know someone may have a spare but I'll have to double

02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:35.000
check with that. It's not that

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:37.000
I didn't have it because I didn't want it.

02:03:37.000 --> 02:03:39.000
I didn't have it because of funs reasons.

02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:41.000
It's all good.

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.000
Now, while running World of Warcraft

02:03:43.000 --> 02:03:45.000
have you ever reached any difficulties

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:47.000
or any guys going

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000
what?

02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:51.000
You know to be honest

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000
yeah, but if I

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.000
stopped when I came

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:57.000
I wouldn't be where I am right now.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:03:59.000
You really need to understand

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:01.000
that you will come across

02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:03.000
people that want you to fail

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.000
but you got to understand that you're doing

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:07.000
something that's you.

02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:09.000
You are a gamer. I'm a gamer.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.000
I know I'm a gamer and I know what I'm doing

02:04:11.000 --> 02:04:13.000
regardless of what anyone does makes me happy.

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.000
Well there you go.

02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:17.000
I can't argue with that type of logic.

02:04:17.000 --> 02:04:19.000
So, when we get out of here, do you have any last words

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:21.000
for any game girls out there who are like

02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:23.000
well, I don't know.

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:25.000
You know

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:27.000
to be honest, you can

02:04:27.000 --> 02:04:29.000
deny being a gamer all you want.

02:04:29.000 --> 02:04:31.000
But the moment you

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:33.000
embrace it and be who you are

02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:35.000
even if you play Farmville

02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.000
even if you play a 3DS

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:39.000
you know, it doesn't

02:04:39.000 --> 02:04:41.000
matter. If you're playing something

02:04:41.000 --> 02:04:43.000
that is immersed

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:45.000
into a digital world

02:04:45.000 --> 02:04:47.000
you're playing a game and you shouldn't

02:04:47.000 --> 02:04:49.000
A. demote it

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:51.000
as not being a gamer and B.

02:04:51.000 --> 02:04:53.000
you shouldn't diminish anybody else

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:55.000
that's following that.

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.000
The video game community is changing

02:04:57.000 --> 02:04:59.000
to include everything from

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:01.000
science to medicine

02:05:01.000 --> 02:05:03.000
to psychology

02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.000
to even the industry booming in business.

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:07.000
I mean, even fashion is becoming a big

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:09.000
part of it and the moment

02:05:09.000 --> 02:05:11.000
that you discriminate and divide

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:13.000
yourself, you're becoming a factor

02:05:13.000 --> 02:05:15.000
in the divide in the gaming industry

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
that me and many other people

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:19.000
are fighting against.

02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.000
Wow, those are some strong

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:23.000
powerful words.

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:25.000
Okay, so let me ask you

02:05:25.000 --> 02:05:27.000
girl gamer

02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:29.000
gamer girl

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:31.000
doesn't really matter.

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.000
It doesn't matter. What matters mostly

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.000
is that if you say you're a girl gamer

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:37.000
or a gamer girl and then you start posting

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:39.000
photos with you with like controllers

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.000
covering your boobs

02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:43.000
you're giving

02:05:43.000 --> 02:05:45.000
a terrible interpretation of what a

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
girl gamer is. That is

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:49.000
the line. If you are not

02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:51.000
a girl gamer and you're out there and you're

02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.000
promoting that you're a girl gamer and you're doing

02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:55.000
very sensual, provocative

02:05:55.000 --> 02:05:57.000
images and representation

02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.000
you are hindering what we're working for.

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.000
I am fighting so hard

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
and many other women are fighting so hard

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:05.000
to give a positive representation

02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:07.000
of girl gamers. And if you're

02:06:07.000 --> 02:06:09.000
also directed to all you ladies that are out

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:11.000
there that are doing this, stop.

02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:13.000
Because we're fighting

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:15.000
through the right type of gamers

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.000
and if you're hurting us

02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000
you're an obstacle. And to be

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:21.000
honest, we will try

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:23.000
everything possible to overrun it.

02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:25.000
Because what you're doing is you're

02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.000
defeating us and you're

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:29.000
contradicting what we're working so

02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:31.000
hard for. There are people that are spending time

02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:33.000
money and effort. There are women who are

02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:35.000
spending so much time, money and effort. And if

02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:37.000
you're out there, just please stop.

02:06:37.000 --> 02:06:39.000
If you want to be sensual

02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:41.000
if you want to be provocative, fine.

02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:43.000
Do it without a controller. Do it without saying

02:06:43.000 --> 02:06:45.000
that you're a girl gamer or a gamer girl.

02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:47.000
Because you're putting us in a bad light.

02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:49.000
And it's disrespectful

02:06:49.000 --> 02:06:51.000
it's hurtful

02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:53.000
and it's obnoxious.

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.000
Wow, like I said, those are some really

02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:57.000
powerful words. So

02:06:57.000 --> 02:06:59.000
for everyone that's out

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:01.000
there watching, listening, where can

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:03.000
you find more information about

02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:05.000
Girl Gamer Vogue? Well, we're at

02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:07.000
GG Vogue, like GG's in Gorilla.

02:07:07.000 --> 02:07:09.000
GGVogue.com or Girl Gamer Vogue

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:11.000
you can find us on Facebook, on Twitter,

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:13.000
on Tumblr, on Instagram, on

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.000
Flickr. I forget

02:07:15.000 --> 02:07:17.000
what other place we're associated with.

02:07:17.000 --> 02:07:19.000
But by all means, we need more girls

02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:21.000
who are just as passionate and prominent

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:23.000
that are looking for a place to call home.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:25.000
Most of the people, if not

02:07:25.000 --> 02:07:27.000
all, probably like 99%,

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.000
they are very comfortable people. You want to

02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:31.000
talk about games by all means. We're

02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:33.000
associated with a bunch of other communities

02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.000
as well. And if you want to play

02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:37.000
Call of Duty, Guild Wars,

02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:39.000
you know, whatever it is, we'll find you a place to

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
find people, to find girls

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
that you can be best friends with. And that's

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:45.000
what we only want to be. We want to be good friends with you.

02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:47.000
Wow, that's pretty good.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:49.000
Well, Jen, thank you for your time. Thank you for having

02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.000
me. Thanks for coming.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.000
No problem. At least we can do.

02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:55.000
Whatever we can do for you, we're here for you.

02:07:55.000 --> 02:07:57.000
DJ Rama S, signing off.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:03.000
Welcome back, everybody, to

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:05.000
Orange Lounge Radio.

02:08:05.000 --> 02:08:07.000
And thank you, DJ Rama S, for that

02:08:07.000 --> 02:08:09.000
interview. And especially

02:08:09.000 --> 02:08:11.000
Jen from Girl Gamer

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
Vogue. I like her.

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:15.000
She's really trying to do a good thing for the

02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:17.000
community. I like when she was talking about

02:08:17.000 --> 02:08:19.000
educating people about the ESRB

02:08:19.000 --> 02:08:21.000
system. And I really think

02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.000
and I hope everybody's listening to her when she talks

02:08:23.000 --> 02:08:25.000
about how, you know,

02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:27.000
our community is

02:08:27.000 --> 02:08:29.000
kind of growing and really embraced

02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:31.000
that, you know, you've got all these different types

02:08:31.000 --> 02:08:33.000
of casual gamers and gaming is something

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
they do in all these different industries and so forth.

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:37.000
So, yeah.

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
Thanks to

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.000
Rama for getting that interview for us.

02:08:41.000 --> 02:08:43.000
And thanks to Jen for being on the show,

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:45.000
even though maybe she didn't know she was going to be on Orange Lounge Radio

02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:47.000
when she first did that interview.

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:49.000
So, a big thank you all around.

02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:51.000
And I want to get

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:53.000
our listeners thinking about this.

02:08:53.000 --> 02:08:55.000
Because I really liked what just

02:08:55.000 --> 02:08:57.000
happened there. I like that a listener

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:59.000
kind of contributed that

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:01.000
particular segment. And it gave us

02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:03.000
something to play on the show that

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
we could actually put on the podcast

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:07.000
that was interesting to listen to.

02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:09.000
And it was, you know, something a little different and the listener

02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000
created. So, we

02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:13.000
want to try, come December

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:15.000
or so forth, we would like to try

02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:17.000
opening up our breaks

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:19.000
to listener created content.

02:09:19.000 --> 02:09:21.000
Now, that particular

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
piece was a little bit long.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:25.000
But we're talking, think about something maybe

02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000
a minute and a half to two minutes long.

02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:29.000
Maybe a news update

02:09:29.000 --> 02:09:31.000
on a particular game or series that you enjoy.

02:09:31.000 --> 02:09:33.000
Or, you know, maybe

02:09:33.000 --> 02:09:35.000
some community updates for a particular

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
community that you're a fan of.

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.000
Or something along those lines.

02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.000
We're not going to start playing those next week.

02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:43.000
But it's something we're looking at for December.

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:45.000
Something where the users create content.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
Now, I do want to be clear on a few

02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:49.000
things.

02:09:49.000 --> 02:09:51.000
You won't be able to actually represent

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.000
OLR and go get

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.000
interviews and say, oh, my interview is going to be

02:09:55.000 --> 02:09:57.000
on OLR. No, no, that's

02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:59.000
for myself, Dark Soccer, and Loki to do.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
But, you know, talk to us

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.000
if you have some ideas along those lines.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:05.000
We'll see what we can arrange. We just, you know, if

02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:07.000
you're going to represent OLR, we have to make sure that you're

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:09.000
not going to do something that could

02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.000
anger a potential guest or what have you.

02:10:11.000 --> 02:10:13.000
So, just be thinking about that.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:15.000
We'll give you more details in the coming weeks.

02:10:15.000 --> 02:10:17.000
But that's something we're hoping

02:10:17.000 --> 02:10:19.000
to do on the show is institute

02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:21.000
user-created content

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.000
in our breaks. So, awesome.

02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:25.000
And remember, I am

02:10:25.000 --> 02:10:27.000
Omega.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:29.000
Damn, apparently

02:10:29.000 --> 02:10:31.000
the live listeners lost the feed for a moment

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:33.000
while I was making that pitch. But once again,

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:35.000
we're looking at doing listener-created content

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:37.000
during the breaks instead of music in little

02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:39.000
two-minute chunks or less

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:41.000
for, you know, whatever community it is

02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:43.000
that you're passionate about. After all,

02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:45.000
it's the show where every gamer has a

02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:47.000
voice, and I think we've been neglecting

02:10:47.000 --> 02:10:49.000
one big way to get

02:10:49.000 --> 02:10:51.000
your voices on the show. Yeah,

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:53.000
OLR reporters, OLR freelancers.

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:55.000
I'm loving those terms in chat. Perfect.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:57.000
So, more information to come in the

02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:59.000
coming weeks. That's something we want to implement in

02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:01.000
January, or excuse me, December.

02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000
Meanwhile, let's

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
get back into some rapid-fire

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:07.000
news. Loki, start us off.

02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:09.000
Alright. So, let's see.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.000
Let's talk a little bit about Black Ops

02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.000
2 since that's going to be coming out this week.

02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:15.000
One of the things that they just recently announced

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:17.000
before they had the whole

02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:19.000
streaming that you can do of your gameplay

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:21.000
with the League play and stuff like that.

02:11:21.000 --> 02:11:23.000
Well, now it's been confirmed that

02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:25.000
that's going to be linked in with

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.000
YouTube live streaming. So, you're going to

02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:29.000
build a live stream on Xbox

02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:31.000
360, PlayStation 3, and

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:33.000
on the PC version as well.

02:11:33.000 --> 02:11:35.000
No word on the Wii U yet because

02:11:35.000 --> 02:11:37.000
a lot of the integration that they have with Elite and stuff

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:39.000
like that on the Wii U doesn't quite work.

02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:41.000
But, it's pretty cool. Also, I guess

02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.000
you're going to be able to see the player's gamer card

02:11:43.000 --> 02:11:45.000
of whoever you're streaming and some other

02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:47.000
additional information like class loadouts

02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.000
and stats and stuff like that.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:51.000
It's pretty cool. I actually did spot

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:53.000
some of this stuff when I was doing the

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:55.000
local play stuff.

02:11:55.000 --> 02:11:57.000
They had some options for that, but

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:59.000
really neat that you'll be able to live stream games.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:01.000
I kind of wish they had that for Grand Theft Auto, but

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
that's still a ways away.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:05.000
Neat.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
It's a neat idea. I know live streaming

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
is pretty popular nowadays.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.000
I think that's a neat thing to build into the game, too.

02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:15.000
Yeah,

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
I'm curious what this is going to bring.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000
It's neat. Well, it's cool, too,

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:21.000
because a lot of people don't have the hardware

02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.000
to kind of video capture everything that they're doing,

02:12:23.000 --> 02:12:25.000
so this is kind of built into the game, which

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
I think is pretty cool. Well, it's fascinating how the

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:29.000
industry is really embracing it, too. I would have

02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.000
assumed there was going to be resistance to it,

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:33.000
especially, you know, we talked about the Microsoft policy

02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:35.000
and all that stuff some time ago,

02:12:35.000 --> 02:12:37.000
which is kind of this strange in the middle

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:39.000
place, but it is very interesting

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
how, you know, instead of

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:43.000
the game companies going to

02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:45.000
try and shut down places like Twitch TV

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:47.000
and the other streaming sites, they're really saying,

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:49.000
alright, this is something people want to do.

02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:51.000
It's promotion for our game. Let's do it.

02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:53.000
Yeah. Now, here's a weird

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:55.000
promotion. They're doing something with Halo 4

02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000
and their multiplayer, where

02:12:57.000 --> 02:12:59.000
they're actually allowing players to

02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:01.000
get Microsoft

02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:03.000
points for playing multiplayer,

02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:05.000
and here's how it works. Okay, so

02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.000
basically, if you get Halo 4

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
and you play 35

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.000
hours plus, and this is between

02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:13.000
launch until the end of this month,

02:13:13.000 --> 02:13:15.000
so November 30th is a cutoff for it,

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:17.000
but if you play over 35

02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:19.000
hours, you're going to get 100 Microsoft

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:21.000
points. If you...

02:13:21.000 --> 02:13:23.000
Whoopee! I know. Whoopee shit.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:25.000
Ooh, a dollar and like

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.000
20 cents or something. Okay, so then

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.000
if you play

02:13:29.000 --> 02:13:31.000
$1.25, that's what it was,

02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:33.000
70 hours,

02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000
guess what?

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:37.000
You're going to double that.

02:13:37.000 --> 02:13:39.000
Or, I'm sorry, you're going to triple that. You're going to get

02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:41.000
300 Microsoft points.

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.000
Yay, a denomination that

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:45.000
totally doesn't round out anything.

02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:47.000
So, you're going to have

02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:49.000
300 Microsoft points possible

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:51.000
there for you guys.

02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:53.000
Also, if you happen to play over

02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:55.000
140 hours...

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
Was this only online multiplayer?

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
This is only online multiplayer.

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:01.000
Halo 4 multiplayer... Matchmaking

02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000
or customer, does it say? It's multiplayer

02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:05.000
over Xbox Live. So,

02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:07.000
I could make a custom match,

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
set the timer to unlimited,

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:11.000
have it run all day,

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:13.000
have me and my friends set up a custom match

02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:15.000
have the timer run all day, and I could do that, right?

02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000
If I wanted to be...

02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:19.000
I don't know if they'd let you do that.

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:21.000
I mean, it would be a big waste of time,

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:23.000
but I guess I suppose you could do that.

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:25.000
Also,

02:14:25.000 --> 02:14:27.000
I guess they're also doing...

02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:29.000
It's going to be up to 800 Microsoft points.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.000
So, I'm kind of confused to where they're going to get this

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
800 Microsoft points, I guess.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:35.000
Oh, I'm sorry, the extra

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.000
200 is coming from spending

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:39.000
at least 3,000 Microsoft points on the

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.000
Halo Marketplace content.

02:14:41.000 --> 02:14:43.000
Woohoo,

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.000
200 points back after spending...

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:47.000
So, it's like a dinky two-buck rebate.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:49.000
Yeah, 3,000 Microsoft

02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:51.000
points, which is the

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
equivalent of almost...

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:55.000
What is that?

02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:57.000
40 bucks?

02:14:57.000 --> 02:14:59.000
Almost?

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
I don't know.

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
All the point values are just...

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:05.000
It's annoying.

02:15:05.000 --> 02:15:07.000
So, yeah, there you have it.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
Some money back if you do that.

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
Oh, and I guess also if you...

02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.000
If you spend,

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:15.000
I guess, 1,500 Microsoft points,

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.000
you get 100 Microsoft points back.

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
Fantastic, I guess.

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.000
But it is kind of neat, though, to see

02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:24.000
that you can earn some Microsoft points

02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.000
for playing a game for a long period of time.

02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:28.000
YYR says it's more like a thank you

02:15:28.000 --> 02:15:30.000
to the people who are going to do it anyway.

02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:32.000
I think it's just trying to get people to play

02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:34.000
a long time so that they can try to beat up

02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:36.000
Black Ops 2, which is probably going to dominate

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:38.000
multiplayer, and they want

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:40.000
to have it look nice when

02:15:40.000 --> 02:15:42.000
Halo 4 is at the top of the charts there, but

02:15:42.000 --> 02:15:44.000
it's going to be tough.

02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:46.000
And last but not least,

02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:48.000
there's been a lot of information

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:50.000
regarding Grand Theft Auto 5 coming out.

02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.000
All of this coming from the brand new issue

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:54.000
of Game Informer.

02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000
And a lot of details

02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:58.000
regarding kind of the single player

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:00.000
campaign, including,

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:02.000
you know,

02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:04.000
first off, the game's

02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.000
map itself is going to be

02:16:06.000 --> 02:16:08.000
over... It's going to be bigger

02:16:08.000 --> 02:16:10.000
than Grand Theft Auto 4, San Andreas,

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:12.000
and Red Dead Redemption combined.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:14.000
It's just the

02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:16.000
largest map in any of the games

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:18.000
at all.

02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:20.000
So, that's fantastic.

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:22.000
There's going to be three

02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:24.000
different people that you get to play as.

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.000
Three different protagonists, including

02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.000
let's see here,

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
I'm trying to remember the names of these guys.

02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000
I don't remember.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:36.000
Well, anyways, that's not important.

02:16:36.000 --> 02:16:38.000
But three different people you get to play as.

02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:40.000
Also, they're going to have some different

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:42.000
locations available in the game.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:44.000
Some of the stuff, obviously, you've seen in the

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:46.000
trailers, including

02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:50.000
stuff based off of the

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:52.000
vineyard areas.

02:16:52.000 --> 02:16:54.000
Obviously, Rockford Hills,

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:56.000
which is like Beverly Hills.

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
Blaine County, which is kind of like this

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
desert. They say they have bikers

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
and meth heads in there.

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
Oh, goodie! Vespucci Beach,

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:06.000
which is similar, I guess, to Venice Beach.

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000
Also, some beach fronts

02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000
and stuff like that. They're saying also

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:12.000
the game's going to have

02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.000
a Salton Sea region, a military base,

02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.000
suburban hills.

02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:18.000
There's a Mount Chiliad,

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.000
I guess, which is

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:22.000
a large wilderness area where you can

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:24.000
explore all that. They're also going to have

02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.000
underwater areas that you can

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:28.000
scuba dive in and stuff like that.

02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.000
They've got this

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000
brand new engine that has

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:34.000
multi-mile draw distances

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:36.000
in there. I guess also, you're

02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:38.000
going to be able to do all sorts of things

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:40.000
from, they have a golf course that you can play

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000
a full round of golf in, if you really want to.

02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:44.000
Wow.

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:46.000
All sorts of details.

02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:48.000
As long as I can beat people with my clubs.

02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:50.000
They have

02:17:50.000 --> 02:17:52.000
bowling, strip clubs,

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:54.000
stand-up comedy acts, TV shows,

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
internet cafes, kind of all similar to

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:58.000
what they had before.

02:17:58.000 --> 02:18:00.000
You can also, I guess,

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:02.000
go to the gym. You can attend a sermon.

02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.000
They've got yoga, triathlons

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:06.000
that you can do, base jumping,

02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:08.000
tennis, jet skiing.

02:18:08.000 --> 02:18:10.000
Also, they're getting rid of

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:12.000
the romance stuff in there because

02:18:12.000 --> 02:18:14.000
God was fucking annoying.

02:18:14.000 --> 02:18:16.000
One of the things I thought was really cool about it, though, is

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
the three main characters,

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:20.000
when you're switching between them, they

02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:22.000
go off on their own thing and do

02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:24.000
whatever. They'll

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:26.000
go on their own business.

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:28.000
It zooms out of the map

02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000
like Google Earth, I guess, and then goes into

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.000
these different characters.

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:34.000
The three characters,

02:18:34.000 --> 02:18:36.000
Michael, who I guess is

02:18:36.000 --> 02:18:38.000
the guy who did the voiceover in the first trailer.

02:18:38.000 --> 02:18:40.000
He's a retired bank robber, and

02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:42.000
now he's kind of on the FIB,

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:44.000
the FBI

02:18:44.000 --> 02:18:46.000
Witness Protection

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:48.000
Program.

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:50.000
He's

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:52.000
hiding out.

02:18:52.000 --> 02:18:54.000
Also, there's a guy named Trevor,

02:18:54.000 --> 02:18:56.000
who is this crazy meth

02:18:56.000 --> 02:18:58.000
head, who

02:18:58.000 --> 02:19:00.000
is this crazy

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.000
war veteran or whatever.

02:19:02.000 --> 02:19:04.000
Franklin, who is a repo man.

02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:06.000
It's kind of all them

02:19:06.000 --> 02:19:08.000
coming together to

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:10.000
do these heists.

02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:12.000
But,

02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.000
lots of screenshots. Looks fantastic.

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:16.000
New trailer

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:18.000
is going to be coming out on the 14th this week.

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:20.000
Very excited

02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:22.000
by that. This is definitely

02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:24.000
a game I'm highly, highly

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:26.000
looking forward to. No fanboy involved.

02:19:26.000 --> 02:19:28.000
No, no, not at all. It's the biggest game next year.

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:30.000
All right.

02:19:30.000 --> 02:19:32.000
Some rapid fire news for me.

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:34.000
Gamefly's digital PC client

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.000
is now out. It was in beta for a while,

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
but it is now officially out.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.000
You can download this if you're anybody.

02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:42.000
You don't have to be a Gamefly subscriber to get it.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000
Anybody can have it. Over 1,500

02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000
Windows and Mac titles. This is sounding a little bit

02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:48.000
like a commercial, but it's been around on the game

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:50.000
blogs. If you are

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:52.000
a member, you should be aware, because I know a lot

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:54.000
of you guys are. You can do the whole unlimited PC

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:56.000
play. It's pretty much GameTap.

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:58.000
In a way.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:00.000
Except I don't think it's a lot of the classic games,

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
but more kind of like the games that are,

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.000
you know, they're not super old,

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:06.000
but they're old enough to not really be selling anymore.

02:20:06.000 --> 02:20:08.000
Like, Saints Row 2 is

02:20:08.000 --> 02:20:10.000
unlimited PC play. Right?

02:20:10.000 --> 02:20:12.000
So, there you go.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
Oh, apparently,

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
2K games giving

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:18.000
everybody who downloads the

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:20.000
client a free copy of Bioshock.

02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.000
I don't know if that's still going, but it was going for a while.

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:24.000
It probably only was on the launch day. It's probably done now.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:26.000
But still.

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:28.000
I could just play that on PS3.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.000
That's true. Or, you know,

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:32.000
a lot of folks bought the collection on Steam

02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:34.000
or what have you. Anyhow,

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
Xbox 360 USB data storage.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
It was capped at 16 gigabytes.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000
I don't know if you know that for the USB storage.

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000
They actually raised that.

02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000
In this recent update that happened, it wasn't

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:46.000
really out there, but it has been

02:20:46.000 --> 02:20:48.000
increased to 32 gigabytes.

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:50.000
So, it has been

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:52.000
confirmed with Microsoft that this was

02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:54.000
intentional. So, there

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
you go. That's great news for those folks

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
that need to make way for

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
data to install their Halo 4

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:02.000
They should just not have a cap.

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
Oh, I understand.

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000
I understand they want to sell their overly expensive

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000
hard drives for these systems,

02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000
but it shouldn't have a cap.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000
I mean, they're just selling these

02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:14.000
laptop SATA drives

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:16.000
and charging a really

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000
huge premium on that stuff when

02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000
I

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000
understand you can use external drives to

02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000
supplement that, but only get 32 gigs of

02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000
pop, whereas you can get 2 terabyte

02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000
drive for half the price of like their

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.000
320 drive. So,

02:21:30.000 --> 02:21:32.000
why even bother?

02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:34.000
Well, in my last

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:36.000
story here for rapid fire news,

02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.000
oh, you gotta love

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
porno inspired by video games.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
Yes, Lollipop

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:44.000
Chainsaw is

02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:46.000
inspiring a new porno in

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:48.000
Japan called Tia's Geek

02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000
Cosplay Fuck, and I

02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000
love that fuck is all in capital letters

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000
with an exclamation point.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000
And she dresses up as some of the

02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000
various characters in Lollipop Chainsaw

02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:00.000
including a giant chainsaw

02:22:00.000 --> 02:22:02.000
and she cosplays

02:22:02.000 --> 02:22:04.000
and presumably fucks.

02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000
Well, that is true.

02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000
It's all the same character,

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
it's just all of her alternate costumes from

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000
the game, so if I remember

02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:14.000
correctly,

02:22:14.000 --> 02:22:16.000
and judging by the back picture

02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:18.000
here, I don't think she dresses up

02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:20.000
like anybody else. It's hard to tell because the

02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:22.000
pictures are really small, but I do notice

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:24.000
that

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:26.000
it's definitely a lot of the alternate costumes.

02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:28.000
Although, that one might be, no, no, no,

02:22:28.000 --> 02:22:30.000
that's still...

02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000
Who cares? Naked chick dressing up.

02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000
Exactly. She's allowed to make some mistakes.

02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:36.000
And she has a giant really weird looking chainsaw.

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
That has a heart at the end of it, but I guess that's

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.000
from the game.

02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000
So, there you go.

02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000
That chainsaw just looks really weird.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:46.000
Cosplay Fuck!

02:22:46.000 --> 02:22:48.000
Dark Sakura.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
Try to follow that.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:52.000
Well, I did get

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.000
Final Fuck 10 or X

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
or whatever.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
Six mix.

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
Mental note. Ask Eddie about Dance Dance Fuck

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000
next time he comes on the show.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000
Well,

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:06.000
a little girl named Maya

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:08.000
gets to play Legend of Zelda

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000
The Wind Waker as a girl.

02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000
Basically,

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:14.000
her dad is developer Mike Hoy

02:23:14.000 --> 02:23:16.000
who

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:18.000
basically hex-edited the game to

02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:20.000
replace all of the dialogue to be feminine

02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.000
in regards to Link's gender.

02:23:22.000 --> 02:23:24.000
So, instead of

02:23:24.000 --> 02:23:26.000
Swordman, it's Swordmane

02:23:26.000 --> 02:23:28.000
and Milady instead of My Lad and Master.

02:23:28.000 --> 02:23:30.000
And he's actually

02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:32.000
put the disc image up that you can play.

02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:34.000
And it's pretty

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000
neat. I think that's nice.

02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000
So his daughter can have an adventure

02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000
that feels more believable

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000
to a little girl. To be fair, he's not

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:44.000
actually putting up the disc image because that would be piracy,

02:23:44.000 --> 02:23:46.000
but he's putting up the patch file that if you

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:48.000
find the disc image with a certain MD5

02:23:48.000 --> 02:23:50.000
hash, you can patch it.

02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:52.000
Lollipop Chainsaw stars a girl.

02:23:52.000 --> 02:23:54.000
Just saying.

02:23:54.000 --> 02:23:56.000
Yeah, and the game was also awful.

02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000
That game is almost porn only as it is.

02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000
It's pretty bad though, but it's just...

02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.000
Yeah. How old will Josh have to be

02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:04.000
before you let him play Lollipop Chainsaw?

02:24:04.000 --> 02:24:06.000
I won't let him play it because it's really

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:08.000
terrible. I mean, it is a terrible

02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000
game. He doesn't get to play bad games.

02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:12.000
Listen, if you're gonna waste your time on the game,

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:14.000
just go on the internet and watch porn because seriously

02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:16.000
it's a better use of your time than playing this game.

02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:18.000
I mean, this game is just

02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:20.000
lame. Next story.

02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:22.000
Yes. The Angry Video Game

02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:24.000
Nerd. Now for anyone who's kept up with that Kickstarter,

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.000
you know, there was a Kickstarter to do

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
a movie, and there's a trailer up.

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:30.000
I watched it yesterday.

02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:32.000
And I was like, really?

02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:34.000
Ugh.

02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:36.000
It looks like a bad 90s

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
comedy. I know, I'm gonna watch it just

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.000
for that. But, I don't know, there were some

02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.000
parts that made me laugh, like the guy going,

02:24:42.000 --> 02:24:44.000
Where the fuck is my arm?

02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000
Isn't that guy from something

02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000
because he looks like, he looks like,

02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000
was it the, um, the boss that they had

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
in one of the Mega Man games where he had like the,

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:54.000
you know, the tank body type thing?

02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:56.000
I, maybe, I don't know.

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:58.000
Maybe he's supposed to be a really screwed

02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:00.000
up American Dr. Wily. It looks cheesy

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:02.000
like that Gamers movie. Remember

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:04.000
there's a lot of people that thought that Gamers movie

02:25:04.000 --> 02:25:06.000
was so awesome and then they made a sequel

02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:08.000
to it for God knows what reason. It's probably

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:10.000
because they made a lot of money off of it.

02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000
But, yeah, it's,

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000
whatever. It's supposed to be cheesy.

02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:16.000
People buy it if, you know, or if it's

02:25:16.000 --> 02:25:18.000
a Kickstarter, he's gonna make money from it.

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:20.000
Well, um, you know how before

02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:22.000
we talked about Minecraft being used in schools?

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:24.000
Well, another game is being used in schools, and that's

02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000
Happy Action Theater. The big,

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000
uh, double fine green screen

02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:30.000
game, um, they're using it in

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.000
schools now to help kids with autism

02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:34.000
since verbal language is difficult for

02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.000
autistic kids, then, um,

02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:38.000
they use it for different types of communication

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:40.000
and it's actually, they're getting some, uh,

02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:42.000
significant results with it.

02:25:42.000 --> 02:25:44.000
I think that's really cool. And

02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000
I'm dead.

02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000
Alright, let's get to the FUGL Question

02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:50.000
of the Week.

02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.000
It's right here.

02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:58.000
Every week, we

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:00.000
ask a question on our fan communities on

02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000
Facebook and Google Plus.

02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:04.000
Smoosh them together, you get FUGL.

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:06.000
So, uh, here it is.

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:08.000
Uh, in honor of the fact that we talked a lot about

02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.000
music games tonight. Our show was

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
born of the music gaming community,

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:14.000
but we know we've picked up a variety of listeners

02:26:14.000 --> 02:26:16.000
since our debut over ten years ago and

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
our shift to a general gaming show

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:20.000
several years ago. So what is your

02:26:20.000 --> 02:26:22.000
current thoughts on music gaming?

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:24.000
Is that a genre of game you are into?

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:26.000
Do you think it was a fad that has faded with

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:28.000
the rise and fall of Guitar Hero in the States?

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:30.000
Or is the best yet to come?

02:26:30.000 --> 02:26:32.000
Now, because our show is running a little long

02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:34.000
tonight, I'm gonna keep this really short. I'm only

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:36.000
gonna read a few of these answers, but I really

02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:38.000
encourage you guys to read the full responses

02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:40.000
on our Google Plus community, Orange Lounge Radio,

02:26:40.000 --> 02:26:42.000
and Facebook.com

02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:44.000
slash Orange Lounge Radio. Uh, going

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000
to Google Plus, I'm gonna read this one from

02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000
Redertainment. Like fashion music

02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000
and my exercise group, things run

02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:52.000
in cycles. Music gaming will

02:26:52.000 --> 02:26:54.000
have its comeback, then fizzle out,

02:26:54.000 --> 02:26:56.000
then comeback, then fizzle out again.

02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:58.000
However, ABBA is

02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:00.000
forever. Preach.

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:02.000
Of course you like that one. Preach.

02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:04.000
Of course I read that one.

02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:06.000
How to get Rob to read your comment.

02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:08.000
Uh, Nick M. replies

02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:10.000
and said, Music is a way for us to all

02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.000
express ourselves and tap

02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:14.000
into those feel-good emotions.

02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:16.000
So it really meshes with about any form

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:18.000
of entertainment. For this reason,

02:27:18.000 --> 02:27:20.000
I believe the music genre

02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000
will continue to grow with gaming.

02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.000
It will never die. Technology

02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:26.000
innovations and creativity will allow

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.000
music-driven games to make a huge revival

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000
leaving the best to come.

02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000
Those are some answers from our Google Plus

02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:34.000
community. Let's do a couple from Facebook

02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:36.000
over at Facebook.com

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:38.000
slash Orange Lounge Radio.

02:27:38.000 --> 02:27:40.000
Uh, Matt J. replied and said,

02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000
I love music gaming still.

02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:44.000
My rock band library has grown to

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:46.000
over 1700 songs and I'm playing

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:48.000
almost every day that I can

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:50.000
with a close group of friends. It's been

02:27:50.000 --> 02:27:52.000
sad to see people leave the community, but I'm

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000
still able to find new people I haven't played with.

02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000
While my enthusiasm has

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
died down significantly over the years,

02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:00.000
I'm still very much involved because of the

02:28:00.000 --> 02:28:02.000
social aspect, even online. There's

02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000
such a wonderful, but small, group of people

02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:06.000
playing and it's such an enjoyable experience

02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:08.000
to play along to old-time favorites

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:10.000
with friends or even to discover

02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000
new music.

02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000
Um, going on to some more

02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:16.000
answers here. Oh, I want to hear from

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:18.000
this guy here, DJ Melvis.

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:20.000
Yay!

02:28:20.000 --> 02:28:22.000
The popularity of music gaming now

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:24.000
compared to 10 years ago is really

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.000
night and day, or is nearly night and day.

02:28:26.000 --> 02:28:28.000
What propelled the music gaming crowd then

02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:30.000
was the gamer community, who propelled

02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000
it from a cult following to something

02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.000
mainstream. Competitive tournaments,

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
video footage of said tourneys, it was

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:38.000
something people looked forward to and buzzed about.

02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000
Konami, in America,

02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:42.000
failed to capitalize on that momentum and

02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:44.000
assumed the fans would eat up anything they put out.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
Instead of working with and cultivating

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:48.000
their fanbase, they turned a blind eye to them.

02:28:48.000 --> 02:28:50.000
That ultimately killed a majority

02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000
of their following. Combine that with the demise

02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000
of arcade gaming in America, the tournament

02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000
scene died and the community grew further

02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000
apart. Rockband is pretty much

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:00.000
music gaming's last stand.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:02.000
At least they nailed the whole microtransaction

02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:04.000
process with DLC, and events

02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:06.000
like UmLoud validate its popularity.

02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000
Go harmonics!

02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000
Good plug for UmLoud, by the way,

02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:12.000
which is coming up real soon.

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:14.000
Tell me about it.

02:29:14.000 --> 02:29:16.000
Um,

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:18.000
let's see, I'll do one more here from

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:20.000
Facebook. Again, I'm really sorry I'm limiting this

02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000
tonight, but we're just running long night.

02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000
Chiggers replies and says,

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:38.000
I've been saying the same thing.

02:29:38.000 --> 02:29:40.000
I wonder, too, if they could do something like

02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:42.000
trumpet smith or sitar smith.

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:44.000
I do think they need to somehow incorporate

02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:46.000
music theory into some of the games, though, too.

02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000
Sure, it's fun to play some of your favorite

02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:50.000
songs by memory, but you can't pick up the guitar

02:29:50.000 --> 02:29:52.000
and read music and play something that's not on

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:54.000
the game. For the record, there has been

02:29:54.000 --> 02:29:56.000
Sitar Hero. That was

02:29:56.000 --> 02:29:58.000
a joke, though, right? That was on

02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:00.000
the Austin Powers 3

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:02.000
website as a Flash game.

02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:04.000
But it did exist.

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:06.000
Very interesting. Alright, so. Was it Austin Powers

02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:08.000
3 or was it the, uh,

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:10.000
the Love Guru? It was the Love Guru,

02:30:10.000 --> 02:30:12.000
that was right, yeah.

02:30:12.000 --> 02:30:14.000
Everybody forgot about that game.

02:30:14.000 --> 02:30:16.000
Everybody should forget about that movie.

02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:18.000
So, there you go.

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.000
Quickly, I'll go around the room.

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.000
What's your current thoughts on music gaming?

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:24.000
I think it'll always

02:30:24.000 --> 02:30:26.000
have a niche. We have to remember it didn't really

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
start with DDR or Beatmania.

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
It was dance aerobics.

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
But, you know, I think games,

02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
especially in America, games like Parappa

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.000
the Rappa, and

02:30:36.000 --> 02:30:38.000
I know I loved Bust a Move

02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000
or Bust a Groove or whatever they called it over here.

02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:42.000
We need to totally break that out.

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:44.000
What? Oh, I know, but it was a great game.

02:30:44.000 --> 02:30:46.000
So, I mean, I kind of

02:30:46.000 --> 02:30:48.000
feel like there were games before, and there will still be

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000
games in the future. I think

02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:52.000
it, kind of like that originally, that first

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:54.000
comment I read where, like, it comes, it goes, it comes,

02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:56.000
it goes. I think, um,

02:30:56.000 --> 02:30:58.000
that's kind of how I feel. Loki, Dark Saga?

02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000
Now the Facts of Life theme is stuck in my head.

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
You take the good, you take the bad.

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000
No.

02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000
Um, I

02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:08.000
love music games, so I don't

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:10.000
really, I think it's gonna just

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:12.000
kind of, right now, coast along with

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.000
a lot of the dancing franchises with

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
Just Dance and Dance Central and that kind of stuff.

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
Um,

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:20.000
maybe with the new systems they'll find new

02:31:20.000 --> 02:31:22.000
ways to kind of incorporate

02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:24.000
whatever type of peripherals

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000
that they have into it, like, you know, with

02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:28.000
the Wii U tablet or something like that.

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
Um, I

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
just, you know, I hope it doesn't, I

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000
assume it's just gonna keep, you know, staying around

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:36.000
for a while, because you still have, you know, a niche

02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:38.000
audience that's really into it, and

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:40.000
sometimes that's all it takes is just a niche

02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:42.000
audience, because, I mean, look at a lot of the Atlas

02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:44.000
products and stuff like that that don't sell millions

02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000
of copies, and you have

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000
dozens and dozens of sequels.

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000
Alright, let's move on with some more

02:31:52.000 --> 02:31:54.000
news, and then we'll get to the mailbag and

02:31:54.000 --> 02:31:56.000
some quick calls tonight. So,

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000
uh, Loki. Alright.

02:31:58.000 --> 02:32:00.000
So, let's talk a little bit about

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:02.000
some really weird

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000
patents, and

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
Microsoft has one now

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:08.000
that, it's basically this kind of

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000
DRM system that's gonna use

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:12.000
a Kinect-like camera

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:14.000
to basically monitor

02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.000
the number of users that are watching

02:32:16.000 --> 02:32:18.000
a display of a certain performance

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:20.000
or content or whatever,

02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000
and, um,

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000
basically, you know,

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000
tracking the faces of those

02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000
viewers to see if they have appropriately

02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000
licensed it. So, for example,

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:32.000
I mean, it

02:32:32.000 --> 02:32:34.000
sounds kind of stupid, but, like, let's say

02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.000
I rented a movie or something like that,

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
and then I have to go to the bathroom

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:40.000
and I leave, that the movie would

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:42.000
stop or something because I'm no

02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:44.000
longer in the room, and it's like, oh, shit, the person

02:32:44.000 --> 02:32:46.000
that, you know,

02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000
registered this content is no longer in the

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000
room. I mean, that sounds a little ridiculous,

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
but,

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
I mean, I don't know if this is

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
necessarily gonna be something that they do.

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:58.000
Um, you know,

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:00.000
mentions, I guess, gaming and gaming

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.000
media, also mobile devices.

02:33:02.000 --> 02:33:04.000
Maybe my thought is that

02:33:04.000 --> 02:33:06.000
it's like, you know, your computer

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
will lock, I mean, they have it right

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
now already with, like, some of those

02:33:10.000 --> 02:33:12.000
biometric sensors and

02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.000
stuff, but maybe it's something where your computer

02:33:14.000 --> 02:33:16.000
will lock down if, like,

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:18.000
you know, it doesn't recognize you. Although

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:20.000
that's gonna suck if you get in a car accident and your face

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:22.000
gets defigured, but, you know,

02:33:22.000 --> 02:33:24.000
I don't know. Or, you know, um, I know

02:33:24.000 --> 02:33:26.000
a lot of the live listeners are complaining that the

02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:28.000
OLR feed is going up, what did they say?

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:30.000
Uh, Raginator said, OLR is going

02:33:30.000 --> 02:33:32.000
down faster and more frequently than

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:34.000
White House interns when Clinton was in office.

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.000
Well, you know, I like to,

02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000
uh, grow and shave a beard

02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
pretty frequently as well.

02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.000
I like having a beard,

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:44.000
but then I'll shave it when I have to do Rocky

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.000
or something, an onstage part that requires me to

02:33:46.000 --> 02:33:48.000
shave it. So, you know,

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:50.000
how's that gonna pick that up?

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:52.000
I'm gonna put it this way. It's not that sophisticated.

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:54.000
It's basically looking at

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.000
facial geometry, like, you know,

02:33:56.000 --> 02:33:58.000
the proportions between, you know, space

02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:00.000
between your eyes. So the, you know, bone

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:02.000
structure and that kind of stuff. It's like, okay,

02:34:02.000 --> 02:34:04.000
your face is this wide, your eyes are this far

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:06.000
apart. Yeah, but that technology's not gonna work.

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.000
That's the problem. The, you know,

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:10.000
the Kinect was supposed to do all this stuff

02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:12.000
and it doesn't really work in

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:14.000
the real world. And who really likes signing

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:16.000
into Xbox Live

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:18.000
by staring at the Kinect for

02:34:18.000 --> 02:34:20.000
like 30 seconds?

02:34:20.000 --> 02:34:22.000
Or hitting A and signing

02:34:22.000 --> 02:34:24.000
in, like, you know, right away?

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:26.000
I really hope this technology is only

02:34:26.000 --> 02:34:28.000
being patented to harness it

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000
so that nobody can ever use it.

02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000
That is my real true hope.

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:34.000
But I'm not gonna hold my breath.

02:34:36.000 --> 02:34:38.000
We'll see.

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000
We had news earlier in the year that

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000
Nintendo Power was gonna be having its last

02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:44.000
issue ever. And, uh,

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:46.000
guess what? PlayStation,

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:48.000
the official magazine, following right behind.

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:50.000
The holiday 2012

02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:52.000
issue will be the last issue of the official,

02:34:52.000 --> 02:34:54.000
or, excuse me, PlayStation, the

02:34:54.000 --> 02:34:56.000
official magazine.

02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.000
That is not long after Future

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:00.000
US, who also published Nintendo Power,

02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:02.000
announced that shutdown.

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
So, uh, bye-bye.

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000
Magazine's

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
going bye-bye. There's two.

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
Out the door.

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:12.000
It's unfortunate we don't have, like,

02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000
an iPad version

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000
of it or something that lives on. I don't know.

02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000
Maybe. It makes me very

02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000
depressed because print is beautiful.

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:22.000
And ink smells good.

02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:24.000
I know, but, well, what do you think

02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000
can be done to save this dying industry?

02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:28.000
We still have Play, don't we?

02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:30.000
I think so. I love that magazine.

02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.000
Play better not go anywhere.

02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:34.000
But, uh, what would, I mean,

02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:36.000
do you think this is

02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:38.000
something that could

02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:40.000
make a renaissance someday, where we get,

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:42.000
or is this done because of technology?

02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:44.000
Well, we got EGM again, right?

02:35:44.000 --> 02:35:46.000
Is this just done because of tablets?

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:48.000
I know you don't like to think about it, but...

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
It's a shift.

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
Somebody's gotta design the tablet document

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
if we go there. It really is. The nature

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
of media is really

02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000
turning digital, which is good and bad.

02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.000
I mean, I can

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:02.000
produce digital content.

02:36:02.000 --> 02:36:04.000
The method's the same way.

02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:06.000
I'm more worried about how stuff

02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.000
like that is going to affect printers

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:10.000
and the print shops that rely

02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:12.000
on having a steady client, a big

02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:14.000
client, especially one like Sony, or not

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:16.000
Sony, but, you know, the magazine,

02:36:16.000 --> 02:36:18.000
you know, it's

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000
just gonna put a couple

02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.000
more, you know, little nails in

02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:24.000
while they're building that coffin.

02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:26.000
What do you think about this comment from Dan Shadow

02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:28.000
in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com?

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:30.000
No one reads, and the internet is full of pictures.

02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.000
Speak

02:36:32.000 --> 02:36:34.000
for yourself. Well, here's

02:36:34.000 --> 02:36:36.000
something like, you know, the whole

02:36:36.000 --> 02:36:38.000
shift from digital, or

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
from print to digital.

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
Game Informer has a digital

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
version. How did they get me

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:46.000
to switch over to the digital version

02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:48.000
from print? The

02:36:48.000 --> 02:36:50.000
Grand Theft Auto information came out this week on

02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:52.000
the digital version, and two weeks later

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:54.000
on print. So I want

02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:56.000
the digital version.

02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:58.000
And so that's what it is.

02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:00.000
It doesn't matter anyways. I thumbed through it once, and then

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:02.000
I put it aside, and then I throw

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
them away months later. Loki brings up a

02:37:04.000 --> 02:37:06.000
good point. Is it that need-to-know-

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
right-now mentality, especially

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
in the gaming culture, that might be

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:12.000
hurting magazines a little bit? Well, yeah.

02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
Here's the thing, too. It probably doesn't help.

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:16.000
All that Grand Theft Auto

02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000
information, immediately as soon as it hit

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
the digital version,

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:22.000
it hit the NeoGAF

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
forums, and then it hit all the

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
blogs, and it hit all the websites.

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:28.000
So even if you didn't subscribe to that magazine,

02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000
unless you wanted to read the article by

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000
yourself, you got all the information that

02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:34.000
was right there. To wait for

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:36.000
it to be in print is just ridiculous.

02:37:36.000 --> 02:37:38.000
Why would you do that?

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.000
I mean, other than appreciating

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
the art of printing and all that stuff.

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:44.000
And pretty pictures to look at.

02:37:44.000 --> 02:37:46.000
But now that you have digital versions,

02:37:46.000 --> 02:37:48.000
there's really nothing that's exclusive

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:50.000
anymore to them, momentarily

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:52.000
at least.

02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:54.000
Hell,

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
let's be honest. It took them a day

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:58.000
or two to get my digital version

02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:00.000
converted over.

02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:02.000
I looked at screen caps,

02:38:02.000 --> 02:38:04.000
because you can do screen caps

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
on your iPod or iPhone

02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
or on your iPad,

02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
and I looked at screen caps

02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
of the whole articles. I didn't even need the

02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
digital version to read that stuff.

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:16.000
So,

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:18.000
yeah, it's like, it's

02:38:18.000 --> 02:38:20.000
kind of, you know,

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
unless you have these exclusive articles

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:24.000
that are in your magazine, and you're not sharing

02:38:24.000 --> 02:38:26.000
this stuff, you know, online, and even then,

02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:28.000
when the print article comes out,

02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:30.000
people are just going to post it on a forum, which is

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.000
going to get posted everywhere else.

02:38:32.000 --> 02:38:34.000
It just, it moves too fast

02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000
for print.

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.000
Alright, let's move on to

02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000
Well, this is,

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:43.000
as soon as it works,

02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:45.000
this is, um, an old

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:47.000
format that had a

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
game released in 2010.

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:51.000
Um, have you ever heard of

02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:53.000
Pier Solar?

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
It was released in 2010 for the Sega Mega Drive,

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:57.000
or, as we know it, the Genesis,

02:38:57.000 --> 02:38:59.000
and it's, uh,

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:01.000
like, a 64 megabyte

02:39:01.000 --> 02:39:03.000
cartridge. It was huge.

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
And it was

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
very well received. Now, the

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
group Watermelon, the developer,

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
has a Kickstarter to release

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000
an HD version to come out

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:15.000
for Xbox 360, PC, Mac,

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
Linux, and Dreamcast.

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:19.000
Um, the game already

02:39:19.000 --> 02:39:21.000
has, uh, over 50 hours

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:23.000
of gameplay, 300 locations,

02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:25.000
and 800 NPCs.

02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:27.000
I actually watched

02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:29.000
the, um, the little, uh,

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:31.000
interview on here, and it looks

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:33.000
pretty neat. There, um,

02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:35.000
if you pledge $15, you'll receive

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
a copy of, uh,

02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:39.000
the game when it's released

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000
for whatever platform you wish, and $45

02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000
get a limited edition

02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:45.000
4 CD copy of the soundtrack

02:39:45.000 --> 02:39:47.000
or a digital bundle consisting of the game

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.000
on Xbox 360,

02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:51.000
PC, Mac,

02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:53.000
Linux, one of the three,

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:55.000
as well as a digital copy of the soundtrack.

02:39:55.000 --> 02:39:57.000
There's also a limited edition for $125.

02:39:57.000 --> 02:39:59.000
There's a hard copy of the game

02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:01.000
for either Dreamcast or PC,

02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:03.000
Mac, Linux,

02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:05.000
and, um, the Pierce Solar

02:40:05.000 --> 02:40:07.000
guidebook, signed, uh,

02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000
lithograph, and three figurines.

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:11.000
There's only going to be 250

02:40:11.000 --> 02:40:13.000
of them, uh, produced,

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:15.000
and as of, uh,

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:17.000
when I was reading this, there were, uh,

02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:19.000
just under a hundred pre-ordered. This actually

02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:21.000
might be the first one I put money into.

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
The game looks awesome.

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:25.000
Um,

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:27.000
and, uh,

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:29.000
there were, uh,

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:31.000
the, uh, $999

02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:33.000
Kickstarter

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:35.000
exclusive Dreamcast ones,

02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:37.000
um, have already been

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:39.000
ordered, so,

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
they are currently at $76,468

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:43.000
out of their $139,000

02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:45.000
goal.

02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:47.000
And they have 26 days to go,

02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:49.000
so I want this, and

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:51.000
I think everyone should check it out.

02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:53.000
Bye.

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
Alright, just a few more stories,

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:57.000
then we'll get to the mailbag and the FUs of the week.

02:40:57.000 --> 02:40:59.000
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:03.000
Alright, so,

02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:05.000
um, I think we talked about this

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
before, but there was some

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:09.000
whole controversy about

02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:11.000
the Navy SEALs actually

02:41:11.000 --> 02:41:13.000
helping the developers of

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:15.000
Medal of Honor Warfighter with some of the

02:41:15.000 --> 02:41:17.000
details of the game and stuff like that,

02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:19.000
and it probably doesn't help that they have

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
the whole DLC tying in with that movie

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:23.000
Zero Dark Thirty, which is about the whole,

02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:25.000
you know, SEAL Team 6

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:27.000
infiltrating

02:41:27.000 --> 02:41:29.000
Osama Bin Laden's camp and stuff like that.

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
So anyways,

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
apparently, um,

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
seven SEALs so far have received

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:37.000
letters of reprimand,

02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000
effectively denying them of

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:41.000
promotion and also

02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:43.000
knocking off half their salaries for,

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.000
or docking them half their salaries for two months.

02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:47.000
Which, you know, obviously they're

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000
probably getting paid by EA anyways, but,

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.000
um,

02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:53.000
but yeah, so, that's

02:41:53.000 --> 02:41:55.000
I don't know, I guess

02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:57.000
four of the seven affected

02:41:57.000 --> 02:41:59.000
are still engaging in, um,

02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:01.000
active duty and are still under investigation.

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
But, um,

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:05.000
that kind of sucks.

02:42:05.000 --> 02:42:07.000
But then again, if you're in the military and you're

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
revealing military secrets to a game company,

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
it's

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:13.000
kind of a problem.

02:42:15.000 --> 02:42:17.000
This is having some huge

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:19.000
ramifications, too. This is the type of thing

02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:21.000
I'm hearing reported on CNN.

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:23.000
Yeah. You know? So.

02:42:23.000 --> 02:42:25.000
Well, I mean, that's kind of like

02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:27.000
even a breach of security as far as

02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:29.000
national security.

02:42:29.000 --> 02:42:31.000
You know, if you're talking like

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:33.000
tactics and stuff like that, that

02:42:33.000 --> 02:42:35.000
your SEAL team deployed

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
to infiltrate, you know,

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:39.000
this compound and stuff, that's just

02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
you're not supposed to be sharing

02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
that stuff. Right. Right.

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:45.000
How historically

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.000
accurate is too historically accurate?

02:42:47.000 --> 02:42:49.000
Especially when it's so

02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
recent, you know? Yeah.

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000
Well, moving on to something completely

02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:55.000
different. Capcom is

02:42:55.000 --> 02:42:57.000
apparently going to be hiring 1000

02:42:57.000 --> 02:42:59.000
people. That's pretty cool.

02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:01.000
1000 people over the course of 10

02:43:01.000 --> 02:43:03.000
years. But that would be adding to the

02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.000
1500 game developers that are on staff

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:07.000
currently. This is a

02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:09.000
Capcom representative saying, quote,

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:11.000
we want to further improve the quality of our games

02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:13.000
by maintaining an internal game development

02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:15.000
team. The purpose of

02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:17.000
increasing our game developer team is to create

02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:19.000
a larger percentage of our games internally.

02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:21.000
Therefore, we believe that there will be

02:43:21.000 --> 02:43:23.000
no significant change in total development

02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:25.000
expenditures, mainly because we will

02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.000
be shifting outsourced operations to

02:43:27.000 --> 02:43:29.000
our own workforce. That's

02:43:29.000 --> 02:43:31.000
pretty neat because, you know, there's

02:43:31.000 --> 02:43:33.000
a lot of that outsourcing that goes on in the gaming

02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:35.000
industry as well. And, you know, for all the

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:37.000
Capcom is evil chats that go on

02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:39.000
and, you know, certainly they've made some pretty shitty

02:43:39.000 --> 02:43:41.000
decisions over the past couple of years. Let's be real.

02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000
This is

02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:45.000
pretty cool that they are going to be bringing a lot

02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:47.000
of jobs back.

02:43:47.000 --> 02:43:49.000
Do notice, though, that that

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:51.000
doesn't necessarily mean it's a thousand jobs here.

02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:53.000
It's probably a thousand jobs in Japan.

02:43:53.000 --> 02:43:55.000
But, you know, still, more

02:43:55.000 --> 02:43:57.000
internally developed games, I think, means they can

02:43:57.000 --> 02:43:59.000
kind of keep a closer eye on things and hopefully

02:43:59.000 --> 02:44:01.000
get some

02:44:01.000 --> 02:44:03.000
better products. We'll see.

02:44:03.000 --> 02:44:05.000
Interesting.

02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:07.000
So,

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:09.000
Capcom. Sounds like they're almost

02:44:09.000 --> 02:44:11.000
it's almost double, but not

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000
quite. So.

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:15.000
All right. Well, let's get to our

02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:17.000
mailbag segment.

02:44:17.000 --> 02:44:19.000
Every week you guys send us emails

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:21.000
mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000
and we read some of our

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:25.000
favorites here on the air.

02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:27.000
Dark Soccer, why don't you

02:44:27.000 --> 02:44:29.000
dive into the mailbag head first and read some

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:31.000
emails for us. Just three.

02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:33.000
Just three?

02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:35.000
First of all, this one's a little

02:44:35.000 --> 02:44:37.000
long, but I'll try to get through it quickly.

02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000
Hey, OLR, AZHP here. I heard you guys talk

02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:41.000
about Rhode Island suing 38 Studios for

02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:43.000
$75 million, basically assuming that Rhode Island was

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000
in the right for lawsuit. It seemed like there

02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:47.000
were some assumptions being made, so I wanted to clear up some

02:44:47.000 --> 02:44:49.000
misconceptions. The lawsuit is

02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000
not as straightforward as 38 Studios didn't put out

02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000
a game and we want our money. 38 Studios

02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000
declared bankruptcy, which typically prevents

02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:57.000
a company from being pursued by creditors, in this

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:59.000
case the state of Rhode Island. However, Rhode Island

02:44:59.000 --> 02:45:01.000
suit claims that 38 Studios and Kurt

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.000
Schilling misled Rhode Island

02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:05.000
as to the difficulties involved with putting

02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:07.000
out an MMO, and because Rhode Island was

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:09.000
misled that $75 million was loaned in

02:45:09.000 --> 02:45:11.000
poor trust and should be repaid.

02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:13.000
There's another misconception I wanted to clear up.

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.000
Rhode Island approached 38 Studios

02:45:15.000 --> 02:45:17.000
promising the $75 million

02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
loan and tax breaks if 38 Studios

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:21.000
would move their operation to

02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:23.000
Rhode Island in the first place. Basically, they

02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:25.000
wanted 38 Studios to come to Rhode Island.

02:45:25.000 --> 02:45:27.000
This is basically like a bank saying,

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:29.000
hey, we'll give you a good deal on a

02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:31.000
loan to buy a house, lending you the money,

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.000
you losing your job, going bankrupt and foreclosing

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:35.000
due to unforeseen circumstances, and the bank saying

02:45:35.000 --> 02:45:37.000
whoa, whoa, whoa, you didn't tell me there was a possibility

02:45:37.000 --> 02:45:39.000
you would lose your job. We want our money back.

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000
We're going to take your house.

02:45:41.000 --> 02:45:43.000
So as you guys can see, it's not as

02:45:43.000 --> 02:45:45.000
clear cut that Rhode Island deserves any money

02:45:45.000 --> 02:45:47.000
at all. If you make an investment and it

02:45:47.000 --> 02:45:49.000
doesn't pay off, in my opinion, you should go suck it up

02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:51.000
and take your lumps. But try telling that to

02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:53.000
the governor of Rhode Island. Just my two cents on the matter

02:45:53.000 --> 02:45:55.000
is HP OLR's premier gold star

02:45:55.000 --> 02:45:57.000
recipient. You know, I think that's a

02:45:57.000 --> 02:45:59.000
good point that he brings up, is that, you know,

02:45:59.000 --> 02:46:01.000
Rhode Island did, and I thought we kind of

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:03.000
touched on this a little bit last week because,

02:46:03.000 --> 02:46:05.000
and I'm going to say it again now,

02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:07.000
why was it so goddamn important

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000
that they get this guy in the first place?

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:11.000
You know, and I remember I mentioned last week,

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:13.000
were we blinded by our sports culture?

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:15.000
Where we hold these sportsmen

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:17.000
that do so well in such high regard.

02:46:17.000 --> 02:46:19.000
You know,

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:21.000
was that really Rhode Island's mistake

02:46:21.000 --> 02:46:23.000
possibly? And yeah,

02:46:23.000 --> 02:46:25.000
if that was their mistake, then they in turn need

02:46:25.000 --> 02:46:27.000
to pay for that. You know, I don't know.

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:29.000
But like some of our chatters were

02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:31.000
saying last week, you know, I say all this,

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:33.000
you know, and I know it sounds really

02:46:33.000 --> 02:46:35.000
cold and really mean, and then I'm like anti-

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
sport. I'm not. I'm not any of those things.

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:39.000
I am. I'm kidding.

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:41.000
And I think

02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:43.000
Curt Schilling and all them meant

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:45.000
well, but

02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:47.000
you know, I would like

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000
to do a lot of things. Are you going to give

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:51.000
me 75 million dollars because I mean well

02:46:51.000 --> 02:46:53.000
and I have good intentions and some real good ideas?

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
Probably not.

02:46:57.000 --> 02:46:59.000
You're going to expect to see some things.

02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:01.000
You know, I just, I

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000
I just think

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000
the celebrity of it all

02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:07.000
is what's really to blame at the end of the day.

02:47:07.000 --> 02:47:09.000
But, anyhow.

02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:11.000
Next one is

02:47:11.000 --> 02:47:13.000
and I'm going to save the biggest

02:47:13.000 --> 02:47:15.000
for last, so. Next one

02:47:15.000 --> 02:47:17.000
is just a quick update on a game I talked about

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000
last time I emailed.

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:21.000
And this comes from Catastrophic Moggy, by the way.

02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:23.000
It's Persona 4 Arena

02:47:23.000 --> 02:47:25.000
will not make it to Europe this year.

02:47:25.000 --> 02:47:27.000
I heard about that. You guys got screwed

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:29.000
because that's the region locked one, huh?

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:31.000
That is so messed up. And people wondered

02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:33.000
why we bitched about it being region locked.

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:35.000
I was a pretty big Shin Megami Tensei fan.

02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:37.000
I was really looking forward

02:47:37.000 --> 02:47:39.000
to this game and we still have no idea

02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:41.000
when it will be released. Only that it won't be

02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:43.000
this year. Sigh.

02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:45.000
Excuse me.

02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:47.000
You guys got hosed.

02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:49.000
That's really unfortunate.

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:51.000
I really don't know what

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:53.000
else to say except that, you know,

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000
I wouldn't fault you for

02:47:55.000 --> 02:47:57.000
pirating it at that point.

02:47:57.000 --> 02:47:59.000
I'm not supposed to encourage that.

02:47:59.000 --> 02:48:01.000
You can't really if it's region locked.

02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:03.000
Are you suggesting

02:48:03.000 --> 02:48:05.000
that people can't work around that?

02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.000
Well, you can, but you need

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
a J-Tech system on Xbox 360

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:11.000
or a recent glitch hack system.

02:48:11.000 --> 02:48:13.000
That's what I thought.

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:15.000
And the last email

02:48:15.000 --> 02:48:17.000
comes from your boyfriend.

02:48:17.000 --> 02:48:19.000
Loki's boyfriend?

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:21.000
No.

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:23.000
Yes, Loki's boyfriend.

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:25.000
That was too easy.

02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:27.000
Hi, Alan.

02:48:27.000 --> 02:48:29.000
I know you don't. Hi, Alan.

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:31.000
This question is for Dr. Sakurai

02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:33.000
and it's related to Mass Effect.

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:35.000
So the upcoming

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:37.000
Omega DLC looks pretty rad, but starting

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:39.000
with ME3 proper, Bioware

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:41.000
made some really glaring weird sexist mistakes

02:48:41.000 --> 02:48:43.000
both in Fem Shep's handling

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:45.000
as well as her relationship soiling

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:47.000
Kayden for a lot of shippers who don't give a fuck

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:49.000
about Dude Shep. Me included.

02:48:49.000 --> 02:48:51.000
Thanks to this,

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:53.000
many in the fandom have joked that the female

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:55.000
versions of Mass Effect aliens will end up

02:48:55.000 --> 02:48:57.000
being male face plus bad perm plus

02:48:57.000 --> 02:48:59.000
stock tits armor.

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:01.000
My question is, how do you feel

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.000
about Nereen having proper

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:05.000
separated breasts in screenshots

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:07.000
instead of just a larger breastplate region

02:49:07.000 --> 02:49:09.000
in her robe, considering that Turians are

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000
clearly supposed to be avian, reptilian, or both?

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:13.000
I'm not asking if you're offended

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000
personally, though if you are, let it out,

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:17.000
but from a design perspective, since

02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:19.000
they otherwise did a good job on her face

02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:21.000
and had detailing. And that's from Alan.

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:23.000
First of all,

02:49:23.000 --> 02:49:25.000
I actually didn't notice she had boobs.

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:27.000
I thought she just had plating.

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:29.000
Or maybe like a

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:31.000
kind of segmented chest plate type of thing.

02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:33.000
Because, and I

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:35.000
didn't even really look, think to look

02:49:35.000 --> 02:49:37.000
because of cut dialogue

02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:39.000
in Mass Effect 2.

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000
And that's what I linked to you earlier.

02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000
That I wanted to play.

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:45.000
Oh, yeah, sure.

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:47.000
You're like looking at me like

02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:49.000
what? Yes, yes,

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:51.000
keep talking. Alright, hold on, what am I playing

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:53.000
here? It's the groundskeeper

02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:55.000
on the Citadel in Mass Effect

02:49:55.000 --> 02:49:57.000
2.

02:49:57.000 --> 02:49:59.000
Good evening

02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:01.000
human. It is evening

02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:03.000
isn't it? Without day and night

02:50:03.000 --> 02:50:05.000
I lose track.

02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000
I shipped in from Pallavin last month.

02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:09.000
I'm still getting my bearings.

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:11.000
You'd be surprised how much a trained

02:50:11.000 --> 02:50:13.000
horticulturalist can earn here.

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000
The nicest thing about being on the Citadel

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:17.000
has to be the drinks.

02:50:17.000 --> 02:50:19.000
You might not believe it, but my

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.000
species hasn't invented many

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:23.000
intoxicants. I'm constantly

02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:25.000
amazed by human creativity

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:27.000
when it comes to brewing and distilling.

02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:29.000
Ever had aquarian thruster

02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:31.000
fuel? Must be 99%

02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:33.000
alcohol. I think they

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000
distill it from raw antimatter.

02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000
Antimatter alcohol.

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:39.000
Excuse me for asking, but

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:41.000
you're a female, right?

02:50:41.000 --> 02:50:43.000
You got those funny bumps.

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000
Like an asari. Every time I come

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000
in here some asari asks me to dance.

02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:49.000
First of all, turians don't

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000
dance. Second of all, asari

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:53.000
have those funny bumps that get

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:55.000
in the way.

02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000
That's what I was trying to get to.

02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:59.000
That was cut

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:01.000
dialogue. Basically, you know where

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:03.000
you go talk to him after the croak and ask if

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:05.000
there's fish in the reservoir?

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:07.000
That was cut dialogue for

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:09.000
him. You got some funny bumps, Dark

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:11.000
Sakura. Shut up.

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:13.000
Those are some big bumps.

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:15.000
Shut

02:51:15.000 --> 02:51:17.000
up.

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.000
You know, I actually did have a kitten stand on

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:21.000
my boobs yesterday. Did you?

02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.000
My friend drove me to PetSmart and I

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:25.000
was close to throwing down 60 bucks for this kitten

02:51:25.000 --> 02:51:27.000
because it reminds me of Shermy, but

02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:29.000
that wouldn't be fair to Shermy's memory.

02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:31.000
But yeah, the kitten passed the standing on boobs test.

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:33.000
Just stood there and then

02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:35.000
curled up and purred. Like, okay. I'll have to hold you.

02:51:35.000 --> 02:51:37.000
But yeah, back to

02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:39.000
Mass Effect.

02:51:39.000 --> 02:51:41.000
So I actually didn't even look, and I have

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
some of the comics.

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:45.000
I didn't read some of the

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.000
I looked at pictures of what the female

02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:49.000
turians looked like

02:51:49.000 --> 02:51:51.000
in some of those comics and

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.000
I had the

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:55.000
Yeah, oh my god.

02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.000
I'm sorry for

02:51:57.000 --> 02:51:59.000
She

02:51:59.000 --> 02:52:01.000
doesn't look like super endowed.

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:03.000
Yeah, it's not like overly sexualized.

02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:05.000
I think is important to keep in mind.

02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:07.000
It's not like she's got some tig old biddies.

02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:09.000
You know, it's just like, okay, she's got some

02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.000
funny bumps. That's it.

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.000
It looks like it

02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:15.000
I mean, they kind of look

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.000
flattish. Like, more like an extended ribcage.

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:19.000
Yeah. Like a, well I mean

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:21.000
in general, I think turian ribcage is supposed to be

02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:23.000
really high if you ever looked at the naked model.

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:25.000
It's a fucking alien race. Why are we

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:27.000
so, like

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:29.000
in a fake video game, it's a fake

02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:31.000
alien race. Like, why are we so like, oh, but

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:33.000
it's not lizard accurate. Well, it's not a

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:35.000
fucking lizard. Those are the worst

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:37.000
press I've seen on lizard yet.

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:39.000
Well, I mean, my point was

02:52:39.000 --> 02:52:41.000
it's not something I noticed because

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:43.000
first of all, I didn't really see evidence of it

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:45.000
in the comics. And there was

02:52:45.000 --> 02:52:47.000
that cut dialogue. I didn't think to look

02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:49.000
for boobs. You know,

02:52:49.000 --> 02:52:51.000
I was like, okay, turian chicks don't

02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:53.000
have boobs. Good for them. They

02:52:53.000 --> 02:52:55.000
probably regurgitate to feed their

02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:57.000
young. If they're based off of birds or

02:52:57.000 --> 02:52:59.000
lizards, then that's kind of gross, but

02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:01.000
Alan is in our chat room right now and

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:03.000
says, it's more of an issue that they are hard

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:05.000
and rough and scaly, but suddenly

02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:07.000
soft jubilees. How do you know

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:09.000
those aren't some rough, scaly boobs?

02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:11.000
How do you know they're not all like, how do you know

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:13.000
those aren't the slimiest tits you'll ever see?

02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:15.000
Remember Morden and his chafing?

02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.000
We'll prescribe analgesics.

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:19.000
May cause chafing.

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:21.000
But, um,

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:23.000
but, um,

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000
I think that it's not

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.000
so much of a big deal. I think

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:29.000
I may

02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:31.000
feel differently when I actually play it

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:33.000
and see them in action,

02:53:33.000 --> 02:53:35.000
see if they bounce. But

02:53:35.000 --> 02:53:37.000
it didn't look like boob boobs, you

02:53:37.000 --> 02:53:39.000
know? It just looked like

02:53:39.000 --> 02:53:41.000
a hint of boob.

02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:43.000
Alan in chat is apologizing. Sorry

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:45.000
I asked. I thought it was interesting. No, it is

02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:47.000
I'm yelling at the internet.

02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:49.000
I'm not yelling at you. I would never

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:51.000
yell at you. I cannot wait, by the way, to

02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:53.000
play through Omega with FemShep.

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:55.000
With Team Badass Bitch.

02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:57.000
Cause Aria

02:53:57.000 --> 02:53:59.000
and Nereen.

02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:01.000
Yeah, Omega has one rule.

02:54:01.000 --> 02:54:03.000
Don't fuck with Aria.

02:54:03.000 --> 02:54:05.000
That's my rule too. Don't

02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:07.000
fuck with me.

02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:09.000
Good times.

02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:11.000
Yeah, and Tigerclaw is right. Javok

02:54:11.000 --> 02:54:13.000
did call Solarian's lizard

02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:15.000
people and also said that

02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:17.000
raw Solarian liver

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:19.000
is a delicacy.

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:21.000
And that they used to eat flies.

02:54:21.000 --> 02:54:23.000
Alright, let's get, is that it for emails?

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.000
Yes, it is. Let's get to the FUs

02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:27.000
of the week. Every week we rant

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:29.000
on this show because we can.

02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:37.000
This is bad.

02:54:37.000 --> 02:54:39.000
Here is justice. Here is punishment.

02:54:39.000 --> 02:54:41.000
Don't care.

02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:43.000
This is fucked up.

02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:49.000
I have a huge FU that goes

02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:51.000
to a condition called angular

02:54:51.000 --> 02:54:53.000
calitis.

02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.000
Which some people can use

02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:57.000
for cold source or canker source.

02:54:57.000 --> 02:54:59.000
What they are is when you get a lesion

02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:01.000
in the corner of your mouth

02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:03.000
that forms kind of a pussy scab.

02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:05.000
And it happens to lots of people.

02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:07.000
But the thing that I hate about it

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:09.000
you know, yeah this happened. It happens

02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:11.000
from a vitamin deficiency

02:55:11.000 --> 02:55:13.000
and basically a lot of stress.

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:15.000
But

02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:17.000
what I hate is waking up in the morning

02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:19.000
and having to yawn and forgetting all about it

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.000
and then just it hurt really badly.

02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:23.000
And also drivers

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:25.000
in the parking lot and Whole Foods

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:27.000
you know, screw all you entitled rich people.

02:55:27.000 --> 02:55:29.000
Loki.

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:31.000
Fuck you to Ford in my car.

02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:33.000
He's breaking.

02:55:33.000 --> 02:55:35.000
Like, I had the last

02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:37.000
last time I took it in to get repaired

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:39.000
which you know was about $1200 for the repairs

02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:41.000
I think. You know, he took a bunch of stuff

02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:43.000
and then broke down a month later.

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:45.000
The guy there who had this

02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.000
really weird growth on his face

02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.000
said, oh yeah I've seen

02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:51.000
those cars last for

02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:53.000
300,000 miles. Yeah, after you replace

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:55.000
every goddamn part in the car

02:55:55.000 --> 02:55:57.000
four times

02:55:57.000 --> 02:55:59.000
it's probably lasted that long.

02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:01.000
But then again, it's not the original car

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:03.000
anymore now is it?

02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:05.000
That's it.

02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:07.000
If you want to know my FU of the week, refer to the top of the show.

02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:09.000
It was kind of a shitty weekend.

02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:11.000
I don't want to go back to work tomorrow.

02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:13.000
Wham.

02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:15.000
But I guess we have to be funny.

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:17.000
Alright, a couple more

02:56:17.000 --> 02:56:19.000
news stories for you guys and then we'll open up the

02:56:19.000 --> 02:56:21.000
Skype line quickly at 1877 Game OLR.

02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:23.000
I emphasize quickly, we might only do

02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:25.000
one or two calls tonight depending on who

02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:27.000
all tries to get in. And of course

02:56:27.000 --> 02:56:29.000
Twitter topics, we'll get through as many of those as we can.

02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:31.000
Twitter.com slash OLR. Loki.

02:56:31.000 --> 02:56:33.000
So, Silicon Knights, you remember they were

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:35.000
suing Epic Games

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:37.000
over the whole, you know,

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:39.000
oh Unreal 3 is so hard

02:56:39.000 --> 02:56:41.000
to use.

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:43.000
And they made our game shit.

02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:45.000
Not because we suck or anything.

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:47.000
But they lost.

02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.000
Boop.

02:56:49.000 --> 02:56:51.000
So on top of that,

02:56:51.000 --> 02:56:53.000
not only did they lose

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:55.000
but the new ruling

02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000
I guess doubled the damages

02:56:57.000 --> 02:56:59.000
from 4.5 million to

02:56:59.000 --> 02:57:01.000
9 million. And on top

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:03.000
of that they also have to destroy

02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:05.000
any games that they

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.000
have, any

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.000
unsold games that they have

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:11.000
using the Unreal 3 engine.

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:13.000
So,

02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:15.000
I don't know.

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:17.000
So I guess that means

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:19.000
two human

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:21.000
X-Men, Destiny,

02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:23.000
Siren in Maelstorm,

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:25.000
The Sandman, and The Box

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:27.000
slash Ritualus.

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:31.000
All these games I was

02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:33.000
a really big fan of.

02:57:33.000 --> 02:57:35.000
So if they're destroying all these games

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:37.000
would that mean that they have to con-

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:39.000
They're going in a landfill.

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:41.000
By destroying, does that mean that they just

02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.000
get to work on them a little bit longer?

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:45.000
Yeah.

02:57:47.000 --> 02:57:49.000
That's what you get

02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:51.000
when you place the blame on somebody else.

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000
When, you know, really it was just your

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:55.000
inability to program these games.

02:57:57.000 --> 02:57:59.000
Alright, well one more story for you guys.

02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:01.000
Then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1877

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:03.000
Game OLR or our username on

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:05.000
Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. This is

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:07.000
a story about Charles Hwang.

02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:09.000
If you don't know that name you probably know

02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:11.000
something he co-created. It's Guitar Hero.

02:58:11.000 --> 02:58:13.000
Well what's he doing now?

02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:15.000
Is he doing another music game or doing

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:17.000
something else with gaming?

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:19.000
Not exactly.

02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:21.000
It's called Green Throttle Games

02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:23.000
is the company

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:25.000
he's working on.

02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:27.000
It's a mobile to TV app and

02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:29.000
controller. What it's trying to do is turning

02:58:29.000 --> 02:58:31.000
smartphone games into a

02:58:31.000 --> 02:58:33.000
big screen experience by connecting

02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:35.000
a mobile device directly to an

02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:37.000
HDTV. This would be

02:58:37.000 --> 02:58:39.000
playable on wireless, Bluetooth controllers

02:58:39.000 --> 02:58:41.000
via what's called the Green

02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:43.000
Throttle Arena app.

02:58:43.000 --> 02:58:45.000
In other words, you know,

02:58:45.000 --> 02:58:47.000
I think it's a great idea but

02:58:47.000 --> 02:58:49.000
Apple could knock this out of business in a

02:58:49.000 --> 02:58:51.000
heartbeat. It's a dangerous territory

02:58:51.000 --> 02:58:53.000
I think. There's a lot of people have been saying

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:55.000
Apple TV is only

02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:57.000
moments away from doing something like this.

02:58:57.000 --> 02:58:59.000
I don't know.

02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:01.000
That's all fan wank and Apple hasn't

02:59:01.000 --> 02:59:03.000
done it. My only issue with this

02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:05.000
and great for him to

02:59:05.000 --> 02:59:07.000
do something like this but

02:59:07.000 --> 02:59:09.000
you can do this with any Bluetooth controller.

02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:11.000
Seriously, you take a Bluetooth

02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:13.000
controller, you pair it with

02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:15.000
your phone or device,

02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:17.000
you get the TV out cable

02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:19.000
hook it up to your TV via

02:59:19.000 --> 02:59:21.000
HDMI. Boom. You have

02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:23.000
exactly what he's selling.

02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:25.000
Except, you know, now they're going to have all these

02:59:25.000 --> 02:59:27.000
apps that are within this other app

02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:29.000
that are basically going to all support

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:31.000
this device.

02:59:31.000 --> 02:59:33.000
But you can do that right now

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:35.000
with any controller. In fact,

02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:37.000
you can not only do it with any controller, you can

02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:39.000
do it with a controller you already have. Like

02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:41.000
a DualShock 3 controller or

02:59:41.000 --> 02:59:43.000
a Wii U or

02:59:43.000 --> 02:59:45.000
a Wii Remote

02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:47.000
with the Classic Controller Pro

02:59:47.000 --> 02:59:49.000
or something like that tied in with it.

02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:51.000
They have a lot of games that do support these things

02:59:51.000 --> 02:59:53.000
and with a TV out

02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:55.000
cable

02:59:55.000 --> 02:59:57.000
you can do this already. But

02:59:57.000 --> 02:59:59.000
they're wrapping in a nice package I guess

02:59:59.000 --> 03:00:01.000
so that, you know, it's easy for consumers

03:00:01.000 --> 03:00:03.000
to find all the games that support this controller.

03:00:03.000 --> 03:00:05.000
And it's important to note they are also

03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:07.000
developing their own games in house.

03:00:07.000 --> 03:00:09.000
So, you know, even if Apple were to

03:00:09.000 --> 03:00:11.000
push a button and really fuck this idea

03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:13.000
over, they'd still have, hopefully, some

03:00:13.000 --> 03:00:15.000
solid games to fall back on.

03:00:15.000 --> 03:00:17.000
I'm surprised they haven't done anything like that.

03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:19.000
And, to be fair, I want to throw this out here

03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:21.000
to give this whole thing a break

03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:23.000
because I don't want to sound like I'm poo-pooing the idea

03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:25.000
because I'm not. I would love

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:27.000
to be able to play smartphone games on the TV.

03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:29.000
There's a lot I would like to be able to do that with.

03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:31.000
Um,

03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:33.000
but, um,

03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:35.000
oh, that's my train of thought. Where was I going with this?

03:00:35.000 --> 03:00:37.000
The, um,

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:39.000
Radio Guy's Worst Enemy

03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:41.000
Derailed Train

03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:43.000
I think a lot of the games, also, it seems like

03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:45.000
a lot of them are touch-based. Well, not necessarily

03:00:45.000 --> 03:00:47.000
the games that they're pitching, but like, um,

03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:49.000
you know, like Angry Birds or something like that.

03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:51.000
I don't know what I was going to say.

03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:53.000
Open Faint is like an Apple,

03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:55.000
or is an iOS

03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:57.000
thing that a lot of gaming, you know, companies

03:00:57.000 --> 03:00:59.000
use to plug into their games to do online

03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:01.000
leaderboards and so forth. Game Center

03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:03.000
hasn't put that out of business because

03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:05.000
Open Faint, I guess, offers

03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:07.000
either it's easier to implement or it's a richer

03:01:07.000 --> 03:01:09.000
package. Multi-platform.

03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:11.000
Multi-platform as well and so forth.

03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:13.000
So, you know, who knows?

03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:15.000
Green Throttle could go multi-platform too, I would think.

03:01:15.000 --> 03:01:17.000
Hypothetically, you know,

03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:19.000
with Android tablets or whatever. I don't think even if

03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:21.000
they did something like that where, you know,

03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:23.000
Apple TV or whatever had

03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:25.000
some sort of Bluetooth support, which

03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:27.000
I, honestly,

03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:29.000
I'm surprised that that device doesn't have

03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:31.000
Bluetooth support, you know, the whole Apple TV.

03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:33.000
You know, what they could do,

03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:35.000
which would be interesting, is have

03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:37.000
if you have an Apple TV,

03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:39.000
because doesn't the Apple TV support

03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:41.000
like streaming, like you can content

03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:43.000
stream stuff from your iPod

03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:45.000
or iPad to

03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:47.000
the TV. Maybe say you

03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:49.000
content stream something to

03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:51.000
the TV and then you use a Bluetooth

03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:53.000
controller with that and then you can

03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:55.000
basically use the

03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:57.000
iPad or

03:01:57.000 --> 03:01:59.000
iPod or iPhone device

03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:01.000
as like a tether, almost like, you know,

03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:03.000
using the Wii

03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:05.000
Classic Controller,

03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:07.000
Classic Controller Pro with the Wii.

03:02:07.000 --> 03:02:09.000
You have to use the Wii Remote as kind of like

03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:11.000
the Bluetooth tether to that.

03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:15.000
Alright, well, we're

03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:17.000
going to move on to the Skype line. 1877

03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:19.000
Game OLR or our username

03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:21.000
on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. It is open

03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:23.000
for business now. In the meantime,

03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:25.000
we'll get some last minute stories

03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:27.000
and I want to do some Twitter topics

03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:29.000
as well. Things that were sent into

03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:31.000
twitter.com slash

03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:33.000
OLR. I want

03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:35.000
to do this one first. This is from

03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:37.000
dammit, come on, load.

03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:39.000
Here we go. This one's from

03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:41.000
actdeft. Give a listen

03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:43.000
to the Wii U menu music.

03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:45.000
It's really good and entrancing.

03:02:45.000 --> 03:02:47.000
I did not know that this was

03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:49.000
out, but apparently here it is.

03:02:49.000 --> 03:03:01.000
Here's the thing though.

03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:03.000
I want to go into skeptic mode here because

03:03:03.000 --> 03:03:05.000
I noticed that the YouTube here

03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:07.000
has a link to a website where it says

03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:09.000
full album available and

03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:11.000
then it says check out more Wii U music

03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:13.000
and news at such and such website and

03:03:13.000 --> 03:03:15.000
it's not an official Nintendo site either.

03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:17.000
Now I'm not saying maybe these guys didn't get a Wii U

03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:19.000
but I'm always kind of curious

03:03:19.000 --> 03:03:21.000
when it's this much blatant

03:03:21.000 --> 03:03:23.000
like go here, go to this site.

03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:25.000
I don't know. I'm just saying.

03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:27.000
I'm just saying.

03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:29.000
Could be legit.

03:03:29.000 --> 03:03:31.000
What do you think?

03:03:31.000 --> 03:03:33.000
Is this it? Is this the real deal?

03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:35.000
It sounds pretty Nintendo-y.

03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:37.000
It does sound a little pretty Nintendo-y. I believe it.

03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:39.000
Yeah, I'm not sure.

03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:41.000
We'll know within days

03:03:41.000 --> 03:03:43.000
because those things

03:03:43.000 --> 03:03:45.000
are going to be out very, very,

03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:47.000
very soon.

03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:49.000
Uh, let's go to phones.

03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:51.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:53.000
Hey, so we're Nate. How's it going?

03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:55.000
Hey, good. How are you, Nate?

03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:57.000
Going good. Listen to all y'all

03:03:57.000 --> 03:03:59.000
talks about vaporware and

03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:01.000
green throttle and Wii U music.

03:04:01.000 --> 03:04:03.000
Yeah.

03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:05.000
I just wanted to ask you all

03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:07.000
who do you think is going to win the upcoming console war?

03:04:07.000 --> 03:04:09.000
Who's going to win the upcoming console war?

03:04:09.000 --> 03:04:11.000
And to answer your question

03:04:11.000 --> 03:04:13.000
whether that was legit or not, yes, it is.

03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:15.000
We actually have more menu music.

03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:17.000
Because Kotaku, they were reviewing

03:04:17.000 --> 03:04:19.000
they have their own Wii U thing

03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:21.000
and they wouldn't post a story like that if it was completely

03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:23.000
wrong, you know, because they have a Wii U

03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:25.000
to compare that to.

03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:27.000
Ah, I see. Okay, thank you for that clarification.

03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:29.000
I'm always a little skeptical when it's the internet.

03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:31.000
Alright, so Nate's

03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:33.000
loaded question. No, I'm kidding.

03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:35.000
It's not a loaded question. It's a tough question.

03:04:35.000 --> 03:04:37.000
Who's going to win the upcoming console war?

03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:39.000
Nate, I think it's too damn early to tell.

03:04:39.000 --> 03:04:41.000
And I think you only have one console.

03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:44.000
Well, here's the thing

03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:46.000
because we don't know what

03:04:46.000 --> 03:04:48.000
PlayStation 4 and what the new

03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:50.000
Xbox have under their belt.

03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:52.000
We're not

03:04:52.000 --> 03:04:54.000
really going to know that until E3.

03:04:58.000 --> 03:05:00.000
Right now we have to also

03:05:00.000 --> 03:05:02.000
evaluate, you know, how is the Wii U

03:05:02.000 --> 03:05:04.000
going to do? We're hearing

03:05:04.000 --> 03:05:06.000
about sellouts and pre-order

03:05:06.000 --> 03:05:08.000
stuff and that they're hard to get

03:05:08.000 --> 03:05:10.000
but how much

03:05:10.000 --> 03:05:12.000
of that is legitimately

03:05:12.000 --> 03:05:14.000
everybody wants them in demand and how much of that

03:05:14.000 --> 03:05:16.000
is Nintendo is slowly

03:05:16.000 --> 03:05:18.000
like a faucet

03:05:18.000 --> 03:05:20.000
drip letting these consoles out

03:05:20.000 --> 03:05:22.000
to create that artificial

03:05:22.000 --> 03:05:24.000
demand. Well, I'm going to tell you

03:05:24.000 --> 03:05:26.000
right now who's going to win the whole console wars

03:05:26.000 --> 03:05:28.000
here and it's going to come out of left field

03:05:28.000 --> 03:05:30.000
here. It's the GE Micro Box

03:05:30.000 --> 03:05:32.000
microwave slash

03:05:32.000 --> 03:05:34.000
console.

03:05:34.000 --> 03:05:36.000
Because we're talking about the future and no one knows what the

03:05:36.000 --> 03:05:38.000
future is, that's what's going to win. Microwave console.

03:05:40.000 --> 03:05:42.000
Okay, another question.

03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:44.000
Alright.

03:05:44.000 --> 03:05:46.000
Okay, so I'll

03:05:46.000 --> 03:05:48.000
hear you all talking about Green Throttle.

03:05:48.000 --> 03:05:50.000
If you

03:05:50.000 --> 03:05:52.000
have to pick between Green Throttle and

03:05:52.000 --> 03:05:54.000
Ouya, who would you vote for?

03:05:54.000 --> 03:05:56.000
Oh, damn.

03:05:56.000 --> 03:05:58.000
That's a pretty good question because I don't really

03:05:58.000 --> 03:06:00.000
know enough about Green Throttle

03:06:00.000 --> 03:06:02.000
yet.

03:06:02.000 --> 03:06:04.000
Based on presentation

03:06:04.000 --> 03:06:06.000
and power and

03:06:06.000 --> 03:06:08.000
fame, glory, money.

03:06:08.000 --> 03:06:10.000
I'm going to have to go Ouya.

03:06:10.000 --> 03:06:12.000
Only reason because it's an actual console

03:06:12.000 --> 03:06:14.000
versus basically

03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:16.000
Green Throttle is just, okay, we have a controller

03:06:16.000 --> 03:06:18.000
that's paired with some games that we're making.

03:06:18.000 --> 03:06:20.000
But it doesn't have any hardware platform

03:06:20.000 --> 03:06:22.000
that it's meant for. They don't have like their

03:06:22.000 --> 03:06:24.000
own Android device or something.

03:06:24.000 --> 03:06:26.000
So you're going to get varied performance depending

03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:28.000
on what kind of Android device that you have.

03:06:28.000 --> 03:06:30.000
So that's the only problem there is it's

03:06:30.000 --> 03:06:32.000
not a standardized platform. Whereas the

03:06:32.000 --> 03:06:34.000
Ouya is actually going to be a

03:06:34.000 --> 03:06:36.000
device that they make games for that they know will

03:06:36.000 --> 03:06:38.000
run well on that platform.

03:06:38.000 --> 03:06:40.000
I'm going to say the Ouya as well because

03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:42.000
again, I'm a little concerned about

03:06:42.000 --> 03:06:44.000
Apple could really

03:06:44.000 --> 03:06:46.000
knock this Green Throttle thing down a

03:06:46.000 --> 03:06:48.000
few pegs by doing their own thing.

03:06:48.000 --> 03:06:50.000
Whereas the Ouya is going to be a little tougher.

03:06:50.000 --> 03:06:52.000
I think the Ouya is kind of trying to beat Apple

03:06:52.000 --> 03:06:54.000
at it's own game in a way.

03:06:54.000 --> 03:06:56.000
I think it's a little different. So I'm going to

03:06:56.000 --> 03:06:58.000
go Ouya as well.

03:06:58.000 --> 03:07:00.000
Okay, last question.

03:07:00.000 --> 03:07:02.000
What

03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:04.000
game are you giving

03:07:04.000 --> 03:07:06.000
the best game to come out

03:07:06.000 --> 03:07:08.000
between now

03:07:08.000 --> 03:07:10.000
and summer?

03:07:10.000 --> 03:07:12.000
Now and summer. So of all these games

03:07:12.000 --> 03:07:14.000
that got pushed back to 2013

03:07:14.000 --> 03:07:16.000
that make up the first and second

03:07:16.000 --> 03:07:18.000
quarter releases, what's going to be the best game

03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:20.000
to come out? I'm going to say Mass Effect Trilogy

03:07:20.000 --> 03:07:22.000
on PS3.

03:07:22.000 --> 03:07:24.000
No, no, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

03:07:24.000 --> 03:07:26.000
I am really

03:07:26.000 --> 03:07:28.000
looking forward to the Tomb Raider

03:07:28.000 --> 03:07:30.000
reboot. That's not coming out before

03:07:30.000 --> 03:07:32.000
summer. Oh, get out.

03:07:32.000 --> 03:07:34.000
I thought it was pushed back to like March.

03:07:36.000 --> 03:07:38.000
Yeah, yeah, go look that up in your

03:07:38.000 --> 03:07:40.000
Funkin' Wagonals.

03:07:40.000 --> 03:07:42.000
I'm looking forward

03:07:42.000 --> 03:07:44.000
to Omega. Omega

03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:46.000
DLC, Mass Effect. Are there any games?

03:07:46.000 --> 03:07:48.000
Come on. Oh! Omega.

03:07:48.000 --> 03:07:50.000
I don't know if it'll make summer, Nate,

03:07:50.000 --> 03:07:52.000
but the Final Fantasy XIV

03:07:52.000 --> 03:07:54.000
Realm Reborn. No, that's fall next year.

03:07:54.000 --> 03:07:56.000
I'm damn curious about that.

03:07:56.000 --> 03:07:58.000
Okay, awesome.

03:07:58.000 --> 03:08:00.000
Okay, I'll get off your Skype line.

03:08:00.000 --> 03:08:02.000
I think other people might want to call in.

03:08:02.000 --> 03:08:04.000
That's alright, buddy. Clearly the

03:08:04.000 --> 03:08:06.000
correct answer is Grand Theft Auto V.

03:08:06.000 --> 03:08:08.000
I was going to say, I'm not even going to ask Loki

03:08:08.000 --> 03:08:10.000
because I know the answer is Grand Theft Auto V.

03:08:10.000 --> 03:08:12.000
So there you go, a wide variety of answers.

03:08:12.000 --> 03:08:14.000
With a close second being Bioshock Infinite.

03:08:14.000 --> 03:08:16.000
Oh, yeah, that's going to be a win, too.

03:08:16.000 --> 03:08:18.000
Well, Nate, I'm going to turn the tables on you.

03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:20.000
I got a question for you.

03:08:20.000 --> 03:08:22.000
Um, I don't, I don't give questions.

03:08:22.000 --> 03:08:24.000
But, yes.

03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:26.000
Ask away.

03:08:26.000 --> 03:08:28.000
Alright, you've asked us about

03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:30.000
console wars and what we're looking

03:08:30.000 --> 03:08:32.000
forward to and all this stuff.

03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:34.000
What do you want to see happen in gaming

03:08:34.000 --> 03:08:36.000
in 2013?

03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:38.000
Okay, so,

03:08:38.000 --> 03:08:40.000
um, I'm just going to be a little

03:08:40.000 --> 03:08:42.000
vague because there's other things I could talk

03:08:42.000 --> 03:08:44.000
about but I want to talk about now.

03:08:44.000 --> 03:08:46.000
Um, I would like to see,

03:08:46.000 --> 03:08:48.000
um, the rise

03:08:48.000 --> 03:08:50.000
of indie gaming and also, um,

03:08:50.000 --> 03:08:52.000
like, far less

03:08:52.000 --> 03:08:54.000
social games and all these, like, small,

03:08:54.000 --> 03:08:56.000
like, touchscreen games.

03:08:56.000 --> 03:08:58.000
I would like to see less of in 2013.

03:08:58.000 --> 03:09:00.000
Alright, so you want to see

03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:02.000
indie games come up, but you want to see social

03:09:02.000 --> 03:09:04.000
games go away. I got to tell you, though, buddy,

03:09:04.000 --> 03:09:06.000
that's where a lot of indies get their start

03:09:06.000 --> 03:09:08.000
right now is on iPhone and all that stuff.

03:09:08.000 --> 03:09:10.000
Are you okay with the mobile games?

03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:12.000
Um, I don't have a

03:09:12.000 --> 03:09:14.000
smartphone, so that's, that's like

03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:16.000
a no. So, so

03:09:16.000 --> 03:09:18.000
screw everybody else.

03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:20.000
Um, I'm a consoleer, PCer,

03:09:20.000 --> 03:09:22.000
um,

03:09:22.000 --> 03:09:24.000
I try to play Angry Birds, but that's

03:09:24.000 --> 03:09:26.000
PC. That's, you know what, there's

03:09:26.000 --> 03:09:28.000
indie, of course, has a huge

03:09:28.000 --> 03:09:30.000
life on PC and lots of great indie stuff

03:09:30.000 --> 03:09:32.000
gets their start on PC, so, and

03:09:32.000 --> 03:09:34.000
I'm with you. I'd like to see some more

03:09:34.000 --> 03:09:36.000
indie games make it big. You know, uh,

03:09:36.000 --> 03:09:38.000
the best games to come, we probably

03:09:38.000 --> 03:09:40.000
don't even know about yet. Think about that.

03:09:40.000 --> 03:09:42.000
Alright, Nate, thank you

03:09:42.000 --> 03:09:44.000
for the questions. We appreciate it. Have a

03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:46.000
good one, buddy, okay? Alright, talk to you later.

03:09:46.000 --> 03:09:48.000
Alright, you too. Bye.

03:09:48.000 --> 03:09:50.000
See, I like that. I like the whole

03:09:50.000 --> 03:09:52.000
you're gonna ask me questions? Oh, yeah, buddy,

03:09:52.000 --> 03:09:54.000
I got a question for you.

03:09:54.000 --> 03:09:56.000
Our job sucks,

03:09:56.000 --> 03:09:58.000
huh? No, I'm kidding. No, I loved it.

03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:00.000
I love getting questions. 1877

03:10:00.000 --> 03:10:02.000
Game OLR, or our username on

03:10:02.000 --> 03:10:04.000
Skype. Orange Lounge Radio!

03:10:04.000 --> 03:10:06.000
Let's go to the phones.

03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:10.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

03:10:10.000 --> 03:10:12.000
Legend Zaku here. Zaku, you must have

03:10:12.000 --> 03:10:14.000
loved that interview tonight.

03:10:14.000 --> 03:10:16.000
Huh? Did you, did you hear our interview

03:10:16.000 --> 03:10:18.000
with Eddie tonight?

03:10:18.000 --> 03:10:20.000
Um, yeah, yeah, definitely. I, I

03:10:20.000 --> 03:10:22.000
just caught, like, the, I guess, the tail end

03:10:22.000 --> 03:10:24.000
of it. Oh. After, like, watching

03:10:24.000 --> 03:10:26.000
Walking Dead. For, oh, oh, oh,

03:10:26.000 --> 03:10:28.000
we got, we got shafted for walking.

03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:30.000
I, I, I hear it through the show. I'm sorry, but

03:10:30.000 --> 03:10:32.000
that's kind of, like, religion here.

03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:34.000
We don't, we don't have blood and guts and

03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:36.000
zombies yet. I had a stein full of, like, beer ready to go

03:10:36.000 --> 03:10:38.000
and my snacks. But, yeah,

03:10:38.000 --> 03:10:40.000
um, I guess

03:10:40.000 --> 03:10:42.000
this is probably gonna be out of the ordinary, but

03:10:42.000 --> 03:10:44.000
I've had this, uh,

03:10:44.000 --> 03:10:46.000
this thing that, had, like,

03:10:46.000 --> 03:10:48.000
my Steam collection that I've been wanting to,

03:10:48.000 --> 03:10:50.000
like, wrangle down because I've, like,

03:10:50.000 --> 03:10:52.000
gotten so many games that I have a

03:10:52.000 --> 03:10:54.000
backlog. It's created,

03:10:54.000 --> 03:10:56.000
created such a backlog that I'm not sure

03:10:56.000 --> 03:10:58.000
how to actually systematically

03:10:58.000 --> 03:11:00.000
approach having to tackle

03:11:00.000 --> 03:11:02.000
all these games that I have. I'm gonna post it right

03:11:02.000 --> 03:11:04.000
now in the chat room.

03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:06.000
And I'm just, like,

03:11:06.000 --> 03:11:08.000
like, I have some of them already. I'm putting

03:11:08.000 --> 03:11:10.000
time on them, but there's still,

03:11:10.000 --> 03:11:12.000
there's still plenty, like, that I just bought

03:11:12.000 --> 03:11:14.000
because they were cheap at that point and I just got them

03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:16.000
for the sake of getting them. But now

03:11:16.000 --> 03:11:18.000
it's, like, I don't know,

03:11:18.000 --> 03:11:20.000
like, I'm, like, preventing myself from getting games

03:11:20.000 --> 03:11:22.000
because of, because it's gonna add,

03:11:22.000 --> 03:11:24.000
it's gonna add more fuel to the fire.

03:11:24.000 --> 03:11:26.000
Well, you're doing the right thing by investing

03:11:26.000 --> 03:11:28.000
99 hours in Skyrim.

03:11:28.000 --> 03:11:30.000
52 hours Team 76, Battlefield

03:11:30.000 --> 03:11:32.000
Bad Company. Alright, you got your priorities

03:11:32.000 --> 03:11:34.000
right. I'm just trying to see if there's a game

03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:36.000
you're not playing enough.

03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:38.000
Okay, Torchlight? What's up with this?

03:11:38.000 --> 03:11:40.000
Less than an hour on Torchlight. You gotta fix that, buddy.

03:11:40.000 --> 03:11:42.000
Um, I have put in more time,

03:11:42.000 --> 03:11:44.000
but that was on my Mac.

03:11:44.000 --> 03:11:46.000
And that was, that was when I was heading

03:11:46.000 --> 03:11:48.000
down, you know,

03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:50.000
when I was heading down to Otacon on the train and I

03:11:50.000 --> 03:11:52.000
didn't even have, like, a connection, so I was playing offline.

03:11:52.000 --> 03:11:54.000
So that count,

03:11:54.000 --> 03:11:56.000
that time didn't get counted for yet.

03:11:56.000 --> 03:11:58.000
Uh, you would make Allen

03:11:58.000 --> 03:12:00.000
a very sad puppy with all these Half-Life

03:12:00.000 --> 03:12:02.000
games you own that you haven't even played yet.

03:12:02.000 --> 03:12:04.000
I know, I know, I'm guilty

03:12:04.000 --> 03:12:06.000
of that. Alright. And I'm also in

03:12:06.000 --> 03:12:08.000
between, like, Battlefield 3

03:12:08.000 --> 03:12:10.000
and Hawks, which is, like, crapping out on me,

03:12:10.000 --> 03:12:12.000
so I had to switch up to other games. And, uh,

03:12:12.000 --> 03:12:14.000
Loki, look at this.

03:12:14.000 --> 03:12:16.000
Loki, look, look, look what he's got here,

03:12:16.000 --> 03:12:18.000
sitting in his collection untouched. Right there,

03:12:18.000 --> 03:12:20.000
you see that? Grand Theft Auto 4

03:12:20.000 --> 03:12:22.000
and episodes from Liberty City. What do you have to

03:12:22.000 --> 03:12:24.000
say about that? Probably got him really cheap.

03:12:24.000 --> 03:12:26.000
Yes.

03:12:26.000 --> 03:12:28.000
You can do that.

03:12:28.000 --> 03:12:30.000
You know what, if I were to show you my Steam

03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:32.000
collection and you were to rate me on that same scale,

03:12:32.000 --> 03:12:34.000
you would be like, Rob, I'm taking that

03:12:34.000 --> 03:12:36.000
podcast away from you, so you have time to go play these games.

03:12:36.000 --> 03:12:38.000
Dude, I've got so many indie games that I've

03:12:38.000 --> 03:12:40.000
bought from all these Humble bundles that I have

03:12:40.000 --> 03:12:42.000
never played. We're sitting here hazing

03:12:42.000 --> 03:12:44.000
you on all the stuff you haven't played, but we are

03:12:44.000 --> 03:12:46.000
the worst when it comes to this

03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:48.000
stuff. So, you know what, buddy?

03:12:48.000 --> 03:12:50.000
It's all good. At least you're, uh,

03:12:50.000 --> 03:12:52.000
supporting these developers.

03:12:52.000 --> 03:12:54.000
Alright, one more

03:12:54.000 --> 03:12:56.000
thing. Seeing that Black Friday

03:12:56.000 --> 03:12:58.000
and the holiday shopping season is upon us,

03:12:58.000 --> 03:13:00.000
I'm kind of at a crossroads

03:13:00.000 --> 03:13:02.000
where, like, I don't know what

03:13:02.000 --> 03:13:04.000
else to invest on my 360 that

03:13:04.000 --> 03:13:06.000
isn't already out on PC and isn't already

03:13:06.000 --> 03:13:08.000
on another platform. Like,

03:13:08.000 --> 03:13:10.000
every time I go to GameStop or any video

03:13:10.000 --> 03:13:12.000
game store, I'm always hard, I'm always

03:13:12.000 --> 03:13:14.000
pressed as to trying to find something

03:13:14.000 --> 03:13:16.000
that, A, obviously isn't

03:13:16.000 --> 03:13:18.000
PC or on a PS3, and

03:13:18.000 --> 03:13:20.000
B, isn't, like, a first-person shooter.

03:13:20.000 --> 03:13:22.000
So it's kind of like finding those,

03:13:22.000 --> 03:13:24.000
like, that small scope of

03:13:24.000 --> 03:13:26.000
console exclusives

03:13:26.000 --> 03:13:28.000
that I can't really play that I wouldn't

03:13:28.000 --> 03:13:30.000
normally otherwise play on another platform.

03:13:30.000 --> 03:13:32.000
Honestly, Zaku,

03:13:32.000 --> 03:13:34.000
if Xbox Live isn't doing it for you

03:13:34.000 --> 03:13:36.000
and the community on there, and, um,

03:13:36.000 --> 03:13:38.000
you know, the indie games and some of the stuff that

03:13:38.000 --> 03:13:40.000
you can download on Xbox, uh,

03:13:40.000 --> 03:13:42.000
and all that, maybe you should

03:13:42.000 --> 03:13:44.000
think about offloading your Xbox, because

03:13:44.000 --> 03:13:46.000
yeah, when it comes to exclusives, you know,

03:13:46.000 --> 03:13:48.000
Microsoft's got, you know,

03:13:48.000 --> 03:13:50.000
again, there's Kinect. A PS3 is

03:13:50.000 --> 03:13:52.000
definitely, yeah, I know, I

03:13:52.000 --> 03:13:54.000
understand that, you know, I'm kind of

03:13:54.000 --> 03:13:56.000
contemplating it, but on the

03:13:56.000 --> 03:13:58.000
other hand, I am

03:13:58.000 --> 03:14:00.000
long overdue for a PS3. Let's

03:14:00.000 --> 03:14:02.000
just say that my girlfriend was hinting at

03:14:02.000 --> 03:14:04.000
trying to avoid, you know, telling me to avoid

03:14:04.000 --> 03:14:06.000
getting one in the next couple of

03:14:06.000 --> 03:14:08.000
weeks, so I pretty much, I can

03:14:08.000 --> 03:14:10.000
pretty much say with certainty that she's

03:14:10.000 --> 03:14:12.000
probably hinting towards getting me,

03:14:12.000 --> 03:14:14.000
you know, something like that.

03:14:14.000 --> 03:14:16.000
What a nice girl. So, I might be able to

03:14:16.000 --> 03:14:18.000
exploit that

03:14:18.000 --> 03:14:20.000
avenue in terms of playing the

03:14:20.000 --> 03:14:22.000
PS3 exclusives that I missed

03:14:22.000 --> 03:14:24.000
out on, like Gran Turismo 5,

03:14:24.000 --> 03:14:26.000
the Uncharted series, uh, Metal Gear Solid

03:14:26.000 --> 03:14:28.000
4. No, Gran Turismo 5 never came out.

03:14:28.000 --> 03:14:30.000
Did?

03:14:30.000 --> 03:14:32.000
It's a running joke.

03:14:32.000 --> 03:14:34.000
That's not what Bobby said.

03:14:34.000 --> 03:14:36.000
That's not what Bobby said.

03:14:36.000 --> 03:14:38.000
It did, but it's like,

03:14:38.000 --> 03:14:40.000
yeah, it's kind of like that

03:14:40.000 --> 03:14:42.000
red-headed stepchild, but I mean,

03:14:42.000 --> 03:14:44.000
with GT5, I could plug in, like,

03:14:44.000 --> 03:14:46.000
a high-end racing wheel.

03:14:46.000 --> 03:14:48.000
I wouldn't be able to do a Forza,

03:14:48.000 --> 03:14:50.000
for example, since it's like,

03:14:50.000 --> 03:14:52.000
I'm not going to play with some virtual,

03:14:52.000 --> 03:14:54.000
like, wireless wheel that I have to

03:14:54.000 --> 03:14:56.000
pretend like doing air steering,

03:14:56.000 --> 03:14:58.000
which I have, which is garbage.

03:14:58.000 --> 03:15:00.000
You don't have to do air steering with Forza, though.

03:15:00.000 --> 03:15:02.000
Forza, I, you know, I,

03:15:02.000 --> 03:15:04.000
Bobby was very kind to Forza, and he wrote

03:15:04.000 --> 03:15:06.000
the review on vognetwork.com, and

03:15:06.000 --> 03:15:08.000
I know Actif's a big fan of it as well. I

03:15:08.000 --> 03:15:10.000
played the demo. I liked it, but

03:15:10.000 --> 03:15:12.000
I just spent $120 on

03:15:12.000 --> 03:15:14.000
games this week, so I won't be picking up Forza

03:15:14.000 --> 03:15:16.000
anytime soon, but I'm interested in it. Forza's

03:15:16.000 --> 03:15:18.000
pretty good for what it's worth on

03:15:18.000 --> 03:15:20.000
the 360, but in terms of actually,

03:15:20.000 --> 03:15:22.000
like, for a hardcore game, you know, for

03:15:22.000 --> 03:15:24.000
a hardcore racing gamer

03:15:24.000 --> 03:15:26.000
who wants to, like, plug in their Logitech

03:15:26.000 --> 03:15:28.000
G27 in there, which is not

03:15:28.000 --> 03:15:30.000
even possible because it only supports PC

03:15:30.000 --> 03:15:32.000
and PS3, I'm only,

03:15:32.000 --> 03:15:34.000
you know, I'm basically, like,

03:15:34.000 --> 03:15:36.000
forced to buy their,

03:15:36.000 --> 03:15:38.000
like, you know, their bullshit

03:15:38.000 --> 03:15:40.000
wireless wheel that

03:15:40.000 --> 03:15:42.000
is just like, it's just like a yoke

03:15:42.000 --> 03:15:44.000
shaped thing that just,

03:15:44.000 --> 03:15:46.000
you could just, like, hold it up and just

03:15:46.000 --> 03:15:48.000
stare, and it basically does it for you,

03:15:48.000 --> 03:15:50.000
but it's not cutting it, because it's

03:15:50.000 --> 03:15:52.000
like, I want to have that feel

03:15:52.000 --> 03:15:54.000
and the shock of actually, um,

03:15:54.000 --> 03:15:56.000
driving a car, shifting the

03:15:56.000 --> 03:15:58.000
gears, and so

03:15:58.000 --> 03:16:00.000
forth. Then go out and drive a car.

03:16:00.000 --> 03:16:02.000
Well, drive a car

03:16:02.000 --> 03:16:04.000
at high speeds without getting pulled over,

03:16:04.000 --> 03:16:06.000
sure, sure.

03:16:06.000 --> 03:16:08.000
Sure, buddy. It's worth a shot.

03:16:08.000 --> 03:16:10.000
Go to Montana, ain't no one care out there.

03:16:10.000 --> 03:16:12.000
Alright, Saku, I gotta let you go so we

03:16:12.000 --> 03:16:14.000
can wrap up the show, maybe get one more call, alright?

03:16:14.000 --> 03:16:16.000
Alright. Take care. Have a good one.

03:16:16.000 --> 03:16:18.000
Bye, you too.

03:16:18.000 --> 03:16:20.000
Alright, 1877 Game OLR, our

03:16:20.000 --> 03:16:22.000
username on Skype is OrangeLaunchRadio. I

03:16:22.000 --> 03:16:24.000
suppose we have time for one more

03:16:24.000 --> 03:16:26.000
call, but I want to do some more of these tweets

03:16:26.000 --> 03:16:28.000
here real quick, and then I'll let

03:16:28.000 --> 03:16:30.000
Loki do last minute stories. Uh, TigerClaw

03:16:30.000 --> 03:16:32.000
is sending us a couple tweets. I remember

03:16:32.000 --> 03:16:34.000
reading about this one, and for some reason, they

03:16:34.000 --> 03:16:36.000
make our show roll, but getting it out there,

03:16:36.000 --> 03:16:38.000
what, uh, TigerClaw linked us to on

03:16:38.000 --> 03:16:40.000
GamePolitics.com. Capcom

03:16:40.000 --> 03:16:42.000
can no longer make new Tatsunoko

03:16:42.000 --> 03:16:44.000
games. If you do not own

03:16:44.000 --> 03:16:46.000
the Tatsunoko versus Capcom game,

03:16:46.000 --> 03:16:48.000
uh, you better hurry up and find

03:16:48.000 --> 03:16:50.000
it in a bargain bin somewhere, because Capcom

03:16:50.000 --> 03:16:52.000
no longer holds the rights

03:16:52.000 --> 03:16:54.000
to publish Tatsunoko games.

03:16:54.000 --> 03:16:56.000
That was a limited deal, so,

03:16:56.000 --> 03:16:58.000
uh, if you're hoping-

03:16:58.000 --> 03:17:00.000
I have mine.

03:17:00.000 --> 03:17:02.000
If you're hoping for a part two,

03:17:02.000 --> 03:17:04.000
keep right on hoping.

03:17:04.000 --> 03:17:06.000
This is really interesting. TigerClaw

03:17:06.000 --> 03:17:08.000
linked into another story on, uh,

03:17:08.000 --> 03:17:10.000
uh, Twitter.

03:17:10.000 --> 03:17:12.000
I almost said Skype.

03:17:12.000 --> 03:17:14.000
He didn't link on Skype, he linked on Twitter.

03:17:14.000 --> 03:17:16.000
Foxconn rumored to be planning

03:17:16.000 --> 03:17:18.000
US plants?

03:17:18.000 --> 03:17:20.000
Isn't Foxconn that company in China

03:17:20.000 --> 03:17:22.000
that all those controversial stories-

03:17:22.000 --> 03:17:24.000
Is this a Goodwill thing, or, or

03:17:24.000 --> 03:17:26.000
what is this? But, yeah.

03:17:26.000 --> 03:17:28.000
Apparently, uh, they are evaluating Detroit

03:17:28.000 --> 03:17:30.000
and LA for new operations.

03:17:30.000 --> 03:17:32.000
Um, this is, uh-

03:17:32.000 --> 03:17:34.000
Is there outsourcing here? Are we cheaper

03:17:34.000 --> 03:17:36.000
labor? I- Hold on, I'll get back

03:17:36.000 --> 03:17:38.000
to the story in a minute, but we got one more,

03:17:38.000 --> 03:17:40.000
one more call coming in. I'll take this call, and then we'll go back to the story.

03:17:40.000 --> 03:17:42.000
Hi, you're on Orange Honest Radio. Who's this?

03:17:42.000 --> 03:17:44.000
Hey, this is Act Deft.

03:17:44.000 --> 03:17:46.000
Act Deft? What's on your mind, buddy?

03:17:46.000 --> 03:17:48.000
Well, I want to talk about

03:17:48.000 --> 03:17:50.000
Forza Horizon 2.

03:17:50.000 --> 03:17:52.000
Something that Zaku said.

03:17:52.000 --> 03:17:54.000
Uh-oh. Alright, what'd you want to say in response

03:17:54.000 --> 03:17:56.000
to what Zaku said?

03:17:56.000 --> 03:17:58.000
Uh, he says, uh, Forza

03:17:58.000 --> 03:18:00.000
isn't, or, Forza Horizon

03:18:00.000 --> 03:18:02.000
isn't made for, uh,

03:18:02.000 --> 03:18:04.000
well, playing with, playing

03:18:04.000 --> 03:18:06.000
it with a, with a real controller,

03:18:06.000 --> 03:18:08.000
er, racing controller. Mm-hmm.

03:18:08.000 --> 03:18:10.000
And he's pretty wrong on that.

03:18:10.000 --> 03:18:12.000
He's wrong? You're calling him out?

03:18:12.000 --> 03:18:14.000
Why is he wrong?

03:18:14.000 --> 03:18:16.000
Well, basically, uh, one of the, one of my

03:18:16.000 --> 03:18:18.000
friends I play, uh, Forza,

03:18:18.000 --> 03:18:20.000
uh, frequently with,

03:18:20.000 --> 03:18:22.000
he has a fantastic controller,

03:18:22.000 --> 03:18:24.000
and those controllers are, like, really

03:18:24.000 --> 03:18:26.000
expensive, uh,

03:18:26.000 --> 03:18:28.000
they have a lot of, uh, stuff

03:18:28.000 --> 03:18:30.000
that, that makes it, makes

03:18:30.000 --> 03:18:32.000
it feel like a li-, uh, you're driving

03:18:32.000 --> 03:18:34.000
a real car, so,

03:18:34.000 --> 03:18:36.000
uh, basically, you can,

03:18:36.000 --> 03:18:38.000
uh, play, uh, play,

03:18:38.000 --> 03:18:40.000
sorry, or, uh,

03:18:40.000 --> 03:18:42.000
play with a real controller,

03:18:42.000 --> 03:18:44.000
a good controller, uh, even though

03:18:44.000 --> 03:18:46.000
it, it does feel different,

03:18:46.000 --> 03:18:48.000
from, uh, even from Forza

03:18:48.000 --> 03:18:50.000
4, but

03:18:50.000 --> 03:18:52.000
you can still play it.

03:18:52.000 --> 03:18:54.000
Now, Zaku in chat is, is clarifying,

03:18:54.000 --> 03:18:56.000
I didn't bash Forza Horizon,

03:18:56.000 --> 03:18:58.000
Forza 4 sucked ass on the 360

03:18:58.000 --> 03:19:00.000
wireless steering wheel. Well, that's...

03:19:02.000 --> 03:19:04.000
Well, that's different. I, I, I don't know

03:19:04.000 --> 03:19:06.000
about the, the 360 controller,

03:19:06.000 --> 03:19:08.000
but you can play. Yeah, Forza Horizon,

03:19:08.000 --> 03:19:10.000
the demo played alright to me. I liked

03:19:10.000 --> 03:19:12.000
that it, it was really stupid

03:19:12.000 --> 03:19:14.000
proof, like, the demo was really stupid

03:19:14.000 --> 03:19:16.000
proof, like, I played on Easy, and it was like,

03:19:16.000 --> 03:19:18.000
here, let me break the car

03:19:18.000 --> 03:19:20.000
for you. It's like having a driving instructor

03:19:20.000 --> 03:19:22.000
sitting right next to you. I'm like, oh,

03:19:22.000 --> 03:19:24.000
this is what I needed to be able to play Forza,

03:19:24.000 --> 03:19:26.000
this is great. I'm totally,

03:19:26.000 --> 03:19:28.000
I am being totally honest.

03:19:28.000 --> 03:19:30.000
Well, uh, I have played,

03:19:30.000 --> 03:19:32.000
uh, since Forza 2, and I,

03:19:32.000 --> 03:19:34.000
and I loved it because

03:19:34.000 --> 03:19:36.000
it's so easy to pretty much pick

03:19:36.000 --> 03:19:38.000
up and play, even though, uh,

03:19:38.000 --> 03:19:40.000
it does, uh, get harder on

03:19:40.000 --> 03:19:42.000
later races for the

03:19:42.000 --> 03:19:44.000
difficulty. Sure. It's pretty much

03:19:44.000 --> 03:19:46.000
easy to play because you have

03:19:46.000 --> 03:19:48.000
so much things, uh, that help

03:19:48.000 --> 03:19:50.000
the, the driver, the

03:19:50.000 --> 03:19:52.000
player, that

03:19:52.000 --> 03:19:54.000
you can much, uh, pretty,

03:19:54.000 --> 03:19:56.000
uh, pretty much screw up a race and

03:19:56.000 --> 03:19:58.000
even though, uh,

03:19:58.000 --> 03:20:00.000
the game will help you to correct

03:20:00.000 --> 03:20:02.000
that and be a better player.

03:20:02.000 --> 03:20:04.000
So, you, you give,

03:20:04.000 --> 03:20:06.000
uh, Forza Horizon your stamp of approval

03:20:06.000 --> 03:20:08.000
as well. I know I saw Bobby gave it a good review on

03:20:08.000 --> 03:20:10.000
the site. Did you give it a good review too?

03:20:10.000 --> 03:20:12.000
Yeah, I pretty much

03:20:12.000 --> 03:20:14.000
gave, uh, the same points as

03:20:14.000 --> 03:20:16.000
Bobby, even though, uh,

03:20:16.000 --> 03:20:18.000
the difficulty in Forza Horizon can be

03:20:18.000 --> 03:20:20.000
pretty unforgiving,

03:20:20.000 --> 03:20:22.000
but it's still a great game.

03:20:22.000 --> 03:20:24.000
Uh, even single player or

03:20:24.000 --> 03:20:26.000
multiplayer, it's really good.

03:20:26.000 --> 03:20:28.000
Alright. And, uh, it looks like they

03:20:28.000 --> 03:20:30.000
just want to clarify one more thing. Not bashing the

03:20:30.000 --> 03:20:32.000
game, says Black Wolf. He's bashing Microsoft's

03:20:32.000 --> 03:20:34.000
controller standards.

03:20:34.000 --> 03:20:36.000
No, I know. I know, but

03:20:36.000 --> 03:20:38.000
like I said, if you have a good controller,

03:20:38.000 --> 03:20:40.000
it will work. Yeah, 360 does have some,

03:20:40.000 --> 03:20:42.000
some, uh, that controller does leave some things

03:20:42.000 --> 03:20:44.000
to be desired, especially when it comes to that D-pad.

03:20:44.000 --> 03:20:46.000
Alright, act deft. I'm going to let you go

03:20:46.000 --> 03:20:48.000
so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much, buddy. Okay?

03:20:48.000 --> 03:20:50.000
Thank you. Alright, take care.

03:20:50.000 --> 03:20:52.000
Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

03:20:52.000 --> 03:20:54.000
I'm going to close it up because we are running a little

03:20:54.000 --> 03:20:56.000
long. I want to finish up Twitter and

03:20:56.000 --> 03:20:58.000
then I'll let, uh, uh, Loki do any last

03:20:58.000 --> 03:21:00.000
minute stories or Jamie. Um,

03:21:00.000 --> 03:21:02.000
uh, that Foxconn story, let's see,

03:21:02.000 --> 03:21:04.000
it's a Digitimes report saying that

03:21:04.000 --> 03:21:06.000
Foxconn Electronics plans to set up

03:21:06.000 --> 03:21:08.000
manufacturing plants in the US, looking

03:21:08.000 --> 03:21:10.000
at Detroit and Los Angeles.

03:21:10.000 --> 03:21:12.000
Uh, market watchers are the source of

03:21:12.000 --> 03:21:14.000
the news. Uh, these facilities

03:21:14.000 --> 03:21:16.000
would be expected to handle LCD

03:21:16.000 --> 03:21:18.000
TV manufacturing. It's a

03:21:18.000 --> 03:21:20.000
simpler and more automated process.

03:21:20.000 --> 03:21:22.000
So, um,

03:21:22.000 --> 03:21:24.000
It requires a lot less suicide.

03:21:24.000 --> 03:21:26.000
Stop it.

03:21:26.000 --> 03:21:28.000
Take that with a gigantic grain of

03:21:28.000 --> 03:21:30.000
salt, but there you go.

03:21:30.000 --> 03:21:32.000
Um, one other tweet I want to read

03:21:32.000 --> 03:21:34.000
here is from Spazinator PSN on

03:21:34.000 --> 03:21:36.000
Twitter. Sky, I'm challenging

03:21:36.000 --> 03:21:38.000
to top some of my high

03:21:38.000 --> 03:21:40.000
scores in Game Room.

03:21:40.000 --> 03:21:42.000
Yes, I said Game Room.

03:21:42.000 --> 03:21:44.000
What? What's that? We're going to party like it's 2010.

03:21:44.000 --> 03:21:46.000
Woo! What's a Game Room?

03:21:46.000 --> 03:21:48.000
He's talking about Microsoft Game Room.

03:21:48.000 --> 03:21:50.000
You know, I haven't touched Game Room in a while

03:21:50.000 --> 03:21:52.000
and I should. I'm

03:21:52.000 --> 03:21:54.000
going to go back and, and

03:21:54.000 --> 03:21:56.000
I'll go back and, you know, I did spend money

03:21:56.000 --> 03:21:58.000
on a lot of those games and a lot more

03:21:58.000 --> 03:22:00.000
than I really should be admitting. So I do

03:22:00.000 --> 03:22:02.000
need to go back and show Spazinator

03:22:02.000 --> 03:22:04.000
how it's done. So, uh,

03:22:04.000 --> 03:22:06.000
fine. Challenge accepted.

03:22:06.000 --> 03:22:08.000
Probably be able to set some high scores because

03:22:08.000 --> 03:22:10.000
no one plays it anymore. Challenge accepted!

03:22:10.000 --> 03:22:12.000
Loki, any last

03:22:12.000 --> 03:22:14.000
minute stories? Uh, just a couple.

03:22:14.000 --> 03:22:16.000
There was a comment about

03:22:16.000 --> 03:22:18.000
Minecraft. They

03:22:18.000 --> 03:22:20.000
were, um, basically saying that

03:22:20.000 --> 03:22:22.000
the future of Minecraft is

03:22:22.000 --> 03:22:24.000
the consumer. And the reason that is

03:22:24.000 --> 03:22:26.000
is because one of the things that they're working on is

03:22:26.000 --> 03:22:28.000
the whole new mod

03:22:28.000 --> 03:22:30.000
interface that

03:22:30.000 --> 03:22:32.000
they're going to allow people to be able to

03:22:32.000 --> 03:22:34.000
mod Minecraft a lot easier.

03:22:34.000 --> 03:22:36.000
Because right now it's a little bit difficult. You kind

03:22:36.000 --> 03:22:38.000
of have to replace files in the jar file

03:22:38.000 --> 03:22:40.000
and stuff like that and it's just not

03:22:40.000 --> 03:22:42.000
user friendly. But they are

03:22:42.000 --> 03:22:44.000
working on new framework that's going to allow

03:22:44.000 --> 03:22:46.000
the creating and installing of mods to

03:22:46.000 --> 03:22:48.000
be easier and also, um,

03:22:48.000 --> 03:22:50.000
releasing an official editing suite.

03:22:50.000 --> 03:22:52.000
Also, they're thinking about

03:22:52.000 --> 03:22:54.000
hosting their own private servers so that they

03:22:54.000 --> 03:22:56.000
can have groups of people to build

03:22:56.000 --> 03:22:58.000
their own persistent worlds and

03:22:58.000 --> 03:23:00.000
experiment.

03:23:00.000 --> 03:23:02.000
So that's kind of neat.

03:23:02.000 --> 03:23:04.000
And then there was another comment.

03:23:04.000 --> 03:23:06.000
Ubisoft wants to get

03:23:06.000 --> 03:23:08.000
their full retail

03:23:08.000 --> 03:23:10.000
games onto the Wii

03:23:10.000 --> 03:23:12.000
U eShop

03:23:12.000 --> 03:23:14.000
as soon as possible.

03:23:14.000 --> 03:23:16.000
I can understand why because they

03:23:16.000 --> 03:23:18.000
had a good portion of the games for the

03:23:18.000 --> 03:23:20.000
Vita launch and I bet a lot of those sold digitally.

03:23:20.000 --> 03:23:22.000
Yeah, when there's nothing

03:23:22.000 --> 03:23:24.000
else to buy, your games look pretty appealing.

03:23:24.000 --> 03:23:26.000
They have a lot of games.

03:23:26.000 --> 03:23:28.000
Push button, get game.

03:23:28.000 --> 03:23:30.000
You never even have to hand anybody money.

03:23:30.000 --> 03:23:32.000
Of course, the problem with downloading the games

03:23:32.000 --> 03:23:34.000
is remember you need to have

03:23:34.000 --> 03:23:36.000
storage space which, uh,

03:23:36.000 --> 03:23:38.000
you know, really, you're only going to be able to

03:23:38.000 --> 03:23:40.000
get about one or two games on the

03:23:40.000 --> 03:23:42.000
premium

03:23:42.000 --> 03:23:44.000
model there. You're going to need an external hard drive

03:23:44.000 --> 03:23:46.000
and it's

03:23:46.000 --> 03:23:48.000
an extra step. I understand it's not

03:23:48.000 --> 03:23:50.000
necessarily an expensive step but

03:23:50.000 --> 03:23:52.000
it's still an extra step to have

03:23:52.000 --> 03:23:54.000
a hard drive to

03:23:54.000 --> 03:23:56.000
put those games

03:23:56.000 --> 03:23:58.000
on.

03:23:58.000 --> 03:24:00.000
That's it.

03:24:00.000 --> 03:24:02.000
Alright. Well that does it.

03:24:02.000 --> 03:24:04.000
It's almost a three and a half hour show

03:24:04.000 --> 03:24:06.000
tonight. Well it helps that we

03:24:06.000 --> 03:24:08.000
actually get to play the break tonight so

03:24:08.000 --> 03:24:10.000
it helps give more

03:24:10.000 --> 03:24:12.000
content on the podcast and

03:24:12.000 --> 03:24:14.000
something for the worker bees who listen to our show on

03:24:14.000 --> 03:24:16.000
Mondays and Tuesdays and throughout the week.

03:24:16.000 --> 03:24:18.000
Something to listen to. I really want to

03:24:18.000 --> 03:24:20.000
thank you all for tuning in tonight. I want to

03:24:20.000 --> 03:24:22.000
thank Eddie for coming on the show and staying

03:24:22.000 --> 03:24:24.000
for 45 minutes, close to

03:24:24.000 --> 03:24:26.000
much more than the 15 to 20

03:24:26.000 --> 03:24:28.000
I told him it would be. So big thanks to him

03:24:28.000 --> 03:24:30.000
for coming out tonight. BimaniStyle.com

03:24:30.000 --> 03:24:32.000
I want to thank Jen

03:24:32.000 --> 03:24:34.000
from Girl Gamer Vogue for doing

03:24:34.000 --> 03:24:36.000
that interview with DJ Rama S as well. It was great

03:24:36.000 --> 03:24:38.000
to meet her through Rama

03:24:38.000 --> 03:24:40.000
and I want to thank my

03:24:40.000 --> 03:24:42.000
co-hosts for being here tonight too.

03:24:42.000 --> 03:24:44.000
You're welcome.

03:24:44.000 --> 03:24:46.000
I want to thank myself for being

03:24:46.000 --> 03:24:48.000
here. Thank you Rob. Thank you

03:24:48.000 --> 03:24:50.000
Rob because if it weren't for you I wouldn't be

03:24:50.000 --> 03:24:52.000
here tonight. I wasn't even

03:24:52.000 --> 03:24:54.000
supposed to be here today.

03:24:54.000 --> 03:24:56.000
And I want to thank the listeners for showing

03:24:56.000 --> 03:24:58.000
up through apparently seven

03:24:58.000 --> 03:25:00.000
drops of the feed. They stayed with

03:25:00.000 --> 03:25:02.000
the show tonight. I know right.

03:25:02.000 --> 03:25:04.000
We got to figure out what the hell's. And like

03:25:04.000 --> 03:25:06.000
Alan's not here so there's no bandwidth

03:25:06.000 --> 03:25:08.000
coming out of the office tonight. No I don't think it's us

03:25:08.000 --> 03:25:10.000
because I'm not getting disconnected

03:25:10.000 --> 03:25:12.000
from chat so.

03:25:12.000 --> 03:25:14.000
Something's up. I'm not running anything either so.

03:25:14.000 --> 03:25:16.000
But anyway thank you

03:25:16.000 --> 03:25:18.000
guys again for your support and if you got to the

03:25:18.000 --> 03:25:20.000
whole end of the show you're listening on the podcast

03:25:20.000 --> 03:25:22.000
you know what thank you too for listening to all

03:25:22.000 --> 03:25:24.000
three and a half hours of it. You guys rock.

03:25:24.000 --> 03:25:26.000
Of course I could be really evil and vindictive and put

03:25:26.000 --> 03:25:28.000
the pass phrase like right here at the very very end so

03:25:28.000 --> 03:25:30.000
people have to like. Oh just kidding.

03:25:30.000 --> 03:25:32.000
Boogers. No it's not. Don't listen. It's not it.

03:25:32.000 --> 03:25:34.000
Alright. Anyhow

03:25:34.000 --> 03:25:36.000
let's go around and get everybody's

03:25:36.000 --> 03:25:38.000
final thought. DarkSakura what's your final thought

03:25:38.000 --> 03:25:40.000
tonight? I just got wind a certain bit

03:25:40.000 --> 03:25:42.000
of news that I

03:25:42.000 --> 03:25:44.000
actually think is super cool.

03:25:44.000 --> 03:25:46.000
Have you ever heard of the company

03:25:46.000 --> 03:25:48.000
Bob's Red Mill?

03:25:48.000 --> 03:25:50.000
It makes like grains and cereals

03:25:50.000 --> 03:25:52.000
and gluten free stuff and.

03:25:52.000 --> 03:25:54.000
No but okay. You can find it like in the health

03:25:54.000 --> 03:25:56.000
section that type of thing. Well

03:25:56.000 --> 03:25:58.000
the owner actually just handed over the company

03:25:58.000 --> 03:26:00.000
to the employees to make it employee

03:26:00.000 --> 03:26:02.000
stock owned. Oh.

03:26:02.000 --> 03:26:04.000
Meaning that all of

03:26:04.000 --> 03:26:06.000
the stock

03:26:06.000 --> 03:26:08.000
increases go directly into their retirement

03:26:08.000 --> 03:26:10.000
funds. Nice. As a trust they can

03:26:10.000 --> 03:26:12.000
also borrow from which I wish more

03:26:12.000 --> 03:26:14.000
companies would be like that you know to

03:26:14.000 --> 03:26:16.000
work for the benefit of their employees.

03:26:16.000 --> 03:26:18.000
So just saying not all rich

03:26:18.000 --> 03:26:20.000
people are assholes I guess.

03:26:20.000 --> 03:26:22.000
Saying. Loki your final thought

03:26:22.000 --> 03:26:24.000
tonight. My car sucks.

03:26:24.000 --> 03:26:26.000
Hopefully I get a new car though.

03:26:26.000 --> 03:26:28.000
Because we're looking at new cars now. Or

03:26:28.000 --> 03:26:30.000
new to me cars.

03:26:30.000 --> 03:26:32.000
Not necessarily new cars.

03:26:32.000 --> 03:26:34.000
Less old.

03:26:34.000 --> 03:26:36.000
Not necessarily.

03:26:36.000 --> 03:26:38.000
Less mileage hopefully.

03:26:38.000 --> 03:26:40.000
I want to thank everybody for listening

03:26:40.000 --> 03:26:42.000
to the show tonight and sticking with it

03:26:42.000 --> 03:26:44.000
and remember if you like our show just

03:26:44.000 --> 03:26:46.000
tell a friend or two about the show. Help spread

03:26:46.000 --> 03:26:48.000
the word. That's all we ask. We don't charge

03:26:48.000 --> 03:26:50.000
for it or anything like that. So

03:26:50.000 --> 03:26:52.000
just help spread the word about the VoG network

03:26:52.000 --> 03:26:54.000
and what we're doing here. And that's

03:26:54.000 --> 03:26:56.000
all we want. Just help grow our community.

03:26:56.000 --> 03:26:58.000
That and vote in the podcast awards

03:26:58.000 --> 03:27:00.000
if you can. It would be nice. It would be nice too.

03:27:00.000 --> 03:27:02.000
Vote every day and then

03:27:02.000 --> 03:27:04.000
get another IP and vote there too.

03:27:04.000 --> 03:27:06.000
Don't cheat. Don't cheat.

03:27:06.000 --> 03:27:08.000
Don't cheat. Just vote enthusiastically.

03:27:08.000 --> 03:27:10.000
Just support multiple personalities.

03:27:10.000 --> 03:27:12.000
You'll never know that you voted twice.

03:27:12.000 --> 03:27:14.000
Alright stop. Alright.

03:27:14.000 --> 03:27:16.000
That does it. My final thought.

03:27:16.000 --> 03:27:18.000
I'm gonna go with an old classic.

03:27:18.000 --> 03:27:20.000
My final thought tonight.

03:27:20.000 --> 03:27:22.000
Be good to yourself. And

03:27:22.000 --> 03:27:24.000
each other.

03:27:24.000 --> 03:27:26.000
Be excellent to each other.

03:27:26.000 --> 03:27:28.000
Have a wonderful week everybody. We'll be back

03:27:28.000 --> 03:27:30.000
to do it all again next time. Same bat

03:27:30.000 --> 03:27:32.000
time. Same bat channel.

03:27:32.000 --> 03:27:34.000
Good night everybody.
