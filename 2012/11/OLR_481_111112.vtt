WEBVTT

00:14.047 --> 00:26.316
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight, November 11th, 2012, Nintendo reveals some more details about the Wii U, THQ delays games as stocks fall, and could the Kinect soon police your content licenses?

00:31.616 --> 00:36.777
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.877 --> 00:43.919
[SPEAKER_13]: It is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 481 for this November the 11th of 2012.

00:45.420 --> 00:55.262
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and all that good stuff with my co-host first off the one the only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:55.322 --> 00:55.582
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi.

00:55.942 --> 00:56.883
[SPEAKER_13]: How are you Jamie Summers?

00:57.483 --> 00:58.423
[SPEAKER_13]: Um I'm okay.

00:58.743 --> 01:00.464
[SPEAKER_13]: You're knitting rainbow things over here.

01:00.665 --> 01:03.707
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm crocheting the gayest scarf ever.

01:04.047 --> 01:07.810
[SPEAKER_10]: All it needs is KY Jelly and it'll be gayer.

01:07.931 --> 01:10.873
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you planning in advance of Gay Pride Month?

01:10.913 --> 01:12.775
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you planning to sell these?

01:13.015 --> 01:18.719
[SPEAKER_10]: This is actually a scheme that I've had for a while and I thought was kind of a different bit of yarn.

01:18.739 --> 01:19.500
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'll put a picture up.

01:20.161 --> 01:24.104
[SPEAKER_10]: But I've been taking orders for scrap scarves.

01:24.544 --> 01:26.406
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, I'm working through all of my old cheap yarn.

01:27.026 --> 01:28.747
[SPEAKER_10]: And this was actually fairly cheap skein.

01:28.787 --> 01:31.088
[SPEAKER_10]: I just didn't realize that it was going to crochet up so pretty.

01:31.729 --> 01:40.334
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm actually going to go back and buy more of them to make people scarves and things for various pride events and whatnot.

01:40.534 --> 01:43.716
[SPEAKER_13]: Or like the holidays, because, you know, everybody likes a homemade holiday gift.

01:44.016 --> 01:44.236
[SPEAKER_13]: I do.

01:44.276 --> 01:49.960
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's actually why I texted you a while back and asked if you or Alan were allergic to wool.

01:50.140 --> 01:50.580
[SPEAKER_13]: Yay.

01:51.681 --> 01:51.981
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome.

01:52.641 --> 01:53.002
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm broke.

01:53.322 --> 01:58.225
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll also say hello to somebody that I'm sure is making lots of homemade gifts for the holiday, Tech Master Loki.

01:58.245 --> 02:00.287
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm not.

02:01.728 --> 02:04.490
[SPEAKER_13]: You're not going to bake cookies for everybody for the holidays?

02:04.730 --> 02:06.291
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't do much baking.

02:06.532 --> 02:08.533
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's order some cookies from Colorado.

02:10.174 --> 02:10.454
[SPEAKER_13]: Right?

02:11.595 --> 02:12.676
[SPEAKER_05]: How have you been doing, Loki?

02:12.916 --> 02:15.518
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, fantastic, with my car not working and everything.

02:15.939 --> 02:17.240
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah, sorry to hear about that.

02:17.600 --> 02:19.201
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a Ford we expected.

02:19.745 --> 02:20.866
[SPEAKER_13]: Fix or Repair Daily, right?

02:20.886 --> 02:21.026
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

02:21.286 --> 02:21.546
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

02:22.127 --> 02:24.328
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's not just the three of us on the show every week.

02:24.388 --> 02:26.729
[SPEAKER_13]: It's you guys joining us live in our chat room.

02:27.029 --> 02:30.772
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want to join us in the chat room, head on over to live.vognetwork.com.

02:30.792 --> 02:43.219
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you're listening on the podcast feed, just a reminder, we do tape live every Sunday night at about 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Blackwolf show at The Voice of Geeks Network or vognetwork.com.

02:43.579 --> 02:46.461
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, our chat room, live.vognetwork.com.

02:46.761 --> 02:49.363
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, there is another thing that Ford can stand for.

02:49.543 --> 02:49.763
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

02:49.943 --> 02:50.724
[SPEAKER_10]: Found on Road Dead.

02:50.944 --> 02:51.864
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I've heard that one too.

02:52.385 --> 02:53.165
[SPEAKER_05]: From Parking Lot.

02:54.206 --> 02:55.086
[SPEAKER_13]: But it doesn't work.

02:55.346 --> 02:57.007
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

02:57.488 --> 02:57.768
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

02:58.668 --> 03:05.333
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're going to get into some news and what we've been playing this week and some big interviews tonight that I will talk about in just a moment.

03:05.973 --> 03:06.974
[SPEAKER_13]: But I do want to start off the show.

03:07.054 --> 03:10.716
[SPEAKER_13]: First, because we have some interviews tonight, I know we might have a few new listeners because of that.

03:11.056 --> 03:11.857
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network,

03:37.791 --> 03:39.192
[SPEAKER_13]: Pretty aggressively here in the South.

03:39.232 --> 03:41.893
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know what other words you'd use to describe it.

03:41.933 --> 03:43.234
[SPEAKER_13]: We were angry DDR players.

03:43.334 --> 03:43.754
[SPEAKER_13]: Rah!

03:44.374 --> 03:45.615
[SPEAKER_13]: Damn these arrows, damn them.

03:45.935 --> 03:51.317
[SPEAKER_10]: And birthday parties at Roseville Golf Land where we sat on the floor in front of the fourth mix and ate cake.

03:52.638 --> 03:53.438
[SPEAKER_10]: That was my birthday.

03:53.618 --> 03:59.341
[SPEAKER_13]: I still remember one of the first dream games we ever had on Orange Launch Radio was inspired by Golf Land trips.

03:59.381 --> 04:02.763
[SPEAKER_13]: You called it, what was it, Birthday Party Sniper or something like that?

04:02.803 --> 04:03.083
Yeah.

04:03.943 --> 04:06.686
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, Roseville Golf Land is an interesting place.

04:06.746 --> 04:07.467
[SPEAKER_13]: It still is today.

04:07.607 --> 04:09.048
[SPEAKER_13]: Interesting is a good word to describe it.

04:09.689 --> 04:11.230
[SPEAKER_13]: Like people who pick their nose and eat it.

04:11.390 --> 04:11.951
[SPEAKER_13]: It's interesting.

04:12.431 --> 04:15.795
[SPEAKER_10]: I went like not too long ago and like wore myself out by DDR.

04:15.855 --> 04:17.376
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, I got old.

04:17.396 --> 04:18.938
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, right?

04:19.358 --> 04:23.901
[SPEAKER_13]: But anyway, so 10 years ago we all met playing DDR and, you know, we were really into that scene.

04:23.921 --> 04:26.283
[SPEAKER_13]: And it wasn't just DDR.

04:26.323 --> 04:28.624
[SPEAKER_13]: It was, you know, a lot of the imports coming from Japan.

04:28.664 --> 04:31.206
[SPEAKER_13]: We used to have the Bomani parties here locally.

04:31.446 --> 04:37.150
[SPEAKER_13]: The Sacramentals having the Bomani parties where we'd bust out the Beatmania 5 key and the Beatmania 2DX.

04:37.210 --> 04:40.152
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember I couldn't get that name because a Catholic organization took it.

04:40.552 --> 04:40.893
[SPEAKER_13]: Really?

04:41.073 --> 04:41.353
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

04:42.017 --> 04:42.477
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, Loki,

05:00.962 --> 05:02.903
[SPEAKER_13]: initial D or something like that.

05:02.963 --> 05:13.610
[SPEAKER_13]: We used to go to a little restaurant that was in the parking lot and we just kind of sit around, order things that were bad for us like mozzarella sticks and just talk some shit about video games and what was going on.

05:13.850 --> 05:28.839
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that was really the type of thing we wanted to bring here to the internets is this giant virtual table where we're all sitting on one side of it here in the studio talking our stuff and then you guys kind of make up the rest of that table sitting here with us in the chat room and via the Skype line and so forth.

05:29.139 --> 05:34.506
[SPEAKER_13]: Just talking some good stuff about video games and just having fun with it because that's what video games are all about, fun.

05:34.906 --> 05:36.649
[SPEAKER_10]: Talking smack about stupid people.

05:37.590 --> 05:42.336
[SPEAKER_13]: DDR and that whole thing and Beatmania, Bomani in general, music games was really all about community.

05:42.736 --> 05:47.803
[SPEAKER_13]: So segueing a little bit into one of the interviews we're going to have tonight is with our buddy Eddie.

05:48.303 --> 05:48.984
[SPEAKER_13]: DDR Freak DDR Freak

06:08.098 --> 06:12.641
[SPEAKER_13]: He probably has the largest music game community that's out there.

06:12.701 --> 06:20.045
[SPEAKER_13]: So I want to talk to him just kind of about the past, the future, and so forth, and have some fun commentary with him on that.

06:20.365 --> 06:22.587
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll be talking to him in about 15 minutes or so.

06:23.127 --> 06:24.008
[SPEAKER_13]: GirlGamerVogue.com

06:44.266 --> 06:45.807
[SPEAKER_13]: and GGVogue.com.

07:08.842 --> 07:27.793
[SPEAKER_13]: and you know over these 10 years that we've been doing the show we have a lot of the same people that show up in our chat room week after week and they like to hear the little insights that are going on in our personal lives both the good and the bad and I have to share something with you guys tonight that you know kind of happened I just want to get off my chest because the weird thing about this is

07:28.493 --> 07:35.857
[SPEAKER_13]: and I'm going to apologize to Jamie in advance for this because a lot of this is very deja vu to a story that she told not even three weeks ago on the show.

07:35.878 --> 07:36.478
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfectly okay.

07:36.538 --> 07:37.759
[SPEAKER_10]: Just forgive me if I get sniffy.

07:37.859 --> 07:38.299
[SPEAKER_13]: It's fine.

07:38.999 --> 07:40.280
[SPEAKER_13]: The whole thing's just weird.

07:41.541 --> 07:44.743
[SPEAKER_13]: So you guys can probably guess where I'm going with this if I'm referencing that.

07:46.464 --> 07:52.868
[SPEAKER_13]: As many of you know, I moved in with my boyfriend Alan about, gosh, it was probably about almost two years ago now.

07:54.509 --> 07:56.370
[SPEAKER_13]: And we, actually more like a year and a half.

07:56.430 --> 08:02.694
[SPEAKER_13]: But anyway, he brought with him two cats that he's had for a long time since 2000, I think.

08:02.834 --> 08:06.836
[SPEAKER_13]: I think he got them around October of 2000 and they were about four or six months old at the time.

08:07.136 --> 08:09.418
[SPEAKER_13]: Probably fudging some of these details, but I wasn't around back then.

08:10.839 --> 08:29.192
[SPEAKER_13]: and their names are Maruko and Sanrio and Maruko was a male black cat and Sanrio's a tan cat female and you know I've grown very close to these cats as well and you've probably heard them referenced on the show sometimes in fact it was really weird just the other day I was listening to a playback yes I do listen to OLR once in a

08:32.994 --> 08:33.115
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

08:33.155 --> 08:33.255
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

08:56.563 --> 09:00.326
[SPEAKER_10]: Maruko always pranced around with his tail in the air, so I always called him Mr. Priss.

09:01.367 --> 09:07.511
[SPEAKER_13]: But he was also very vocal and was a really fun cat, and I really have grown to appreciate Maruko.

09:07.811 --> 09:09.313
[SPEAKER_11]: And he loves Sanrio's food.

09:10.513 --> 09:10.894
[SPEAKER_13]: No doubt.

09:11.374 --> 09:13.335
[SPEAKER_13]: You can sadly guess where this is going.

09:13.895 --> 09:16.296
[SPEAKER_13]: We got blindsided a little bit the past couple days.

09:16.716 --> 09:20.697
[SPEAKER_13]: Maruko started showing some really bad symptoms on Thursday and Friday.

09:21.857 --> 09:23.718
[SPEAKER_13]: He just wasn't himself.

09:23.878 --> 09:25.538
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't even describe it.

09:25.959 --> 09:27.139
[SPEAKER_13]: His meows were different.

09:27.199 --> 09:31.080
[SPEAKER_13]: He was always a very vocal cat, and the way he was breathing was very different as well.

09:31.140 --> 09:33.721
[SPEAKER_13]: So I told Alan, well, of course, let's go see the vet right away.

09:34.361 --> 10:02.371
[SPEAKER_13]: and you know we go into the vet's office pretty much thinking oh you know we just need to get some medication he'll be all right whatever but we get the x-rays back and the news is is really bad he had a lot of fluid um in his body in places it shouldn't be um basically so much around his lung that it was basically um pushing on his lung and he was having a hard time breathing that was causing it so um unfortunately um you know a tough decision had to be made and we um we put him down yesterday and it was um

10:04.195 --> 10:05.015
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

10:24.122 --> 10:43.512
[SPEAKER_13]: The veterinarian made it pretty clear that it's probably heart failure, it's probably cancer, or it's this, what is it, FIP, that extremely deadly cat virus that goes around where if you get a cat that has that, I have another friend, this has been a terrible year for kittens, I have another friend that just lost a cat to FIP not that long ago.

10:43.972 --> 10:47.454
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's just like, it's tough, it's tough.

10:48.614 --> 11:03.219
[SPEAKER_10]: with with Shermie she was wheezing when we got back from Disneyland and then I wrapped her up in hot towels for a few days and she perked right back up and then suddenly she just keeled over but the symptoms sound very similar she was having respiratory issues

11:04.490 --> 11:09.392
[SPEAKER_13]: Since some folks in the chat room are asking at live.vognetwork.com, the Maruko was 12 and a half.

11:10.192 --> 11:11.852
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, a little old in kitty years.

11:12.512 --> 11:19.835
[SPEAKER_13]: For an indoor cat, maybe not super old, but definitely, you know, old enough for complications to start coming in.

11:20.395 --> 11:22.375
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, I don't know what else to say.

11:22.415 --> 11:23.616
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to get that off my chest.

11:23.836 --> 11:28.257
[SPEAKER_13]: So that way, if I'm going to sniffle up, I want to do that now and not while we're trying to interview somebody.

11:28.937 --> 11:30.118
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi Eddie, how are you?

11:30.458 --> 11:31.559
[SPEAKER_11]: He was a very good kitty.

11:31.699 --> 11:32.560
[SPEAKER_13]: He was, he was.

11:32.720 --> 11:34.401
[SPEAKER_11]: And he sat in my lap a couple times.

11:34.881 --> 11:35.902
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you used to cat sit.

11:36.322 --> 11:39.044
[SPEAKER_13]: So I know you were one of the first people I called in the parking lot.

11:39.225 --> 11:41.266
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was like, I'm driving.

11:41.386 --> 11:42.687
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, pull over.

11:42.887 --> 11:47.931
[SPEAKER_10]: I was actually literally, this was at what Florin Mall used to be, if you want to know where I was.

11:48.851 --> 12:05.160
[SPEAKER_10]: and I was half in the thing to pull out into the street when you called and I was trying to be considerate I'm driving and I was like okay fine and then it went on to FaceTime I was like oh shit have I been on FaceTime this entire time and turn around and pull in and I had my friend with me and then I just did a circle in the parking lot yeah so

12:06.281 --> 12:08.463
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyway, I want to try and move on.

12:08.483 --> 12:15.390
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to dwell on this too much, but I do want to address some of the comments that are in chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

12:15.430 --> 12:17.372
[SPEAKER_13]: Lots of condolences, and thank you very much.

12:17.472 --> 12:19.575
[SPEAKER_13]: I will pass those along to Alan as well.

12:19.655 --> 12:24.900
[SPEAKER_13]: I was only fortunate enough to know Maruko for about three years, but he did live for 12 and a half years.

12:25.600 --> 12:26.961
[SPEAKER_13]: TigerClaw says, my condolences.

12:27.001 --> 12:29.202
[SPEAKER_13]: Losing a pet is the hardest thing a person could ever go through.

12:29.382 --> 12:30.922
[SPEAKER_13]: It is definitely one of the worst.

12:31.682 --> 12:33.503
[SPEAKER_13]: TigerClaw asks, how about Sanrio?

12:33.543 --> 12:34.603
[SPEAKER_13]: How is she health-wise?

12:35.704 --> 12:44.367
[SPEAKER_13]: Obviously, the plan is when we have money, because yesterday set us back a little bit, but when we have some money, we do want to go in and get her checked and make sure she didn't contract the same virus.

12:44.387 --> 12:46.188
[SPEAKER_13]: That's one of the first things we want to try and rule out.

12:47.728 --> 12:48.468
[SPEAKER_13]: She's doing okay.

12:49.589 --> 12:50.809
[SPEAKER_13]: She's hard to read right now.

12:51.390 --> 12:52.690
[SPEAKER_13]: I think she knows something's up.

12:53.251 --> 12:55.972
[SPEAKER_13]: She's kind of looking around, acting a little differently.

12:56.172 --> 12:57.693
[SPEAKER_13]: I think she knows that something's missing.

12:58.913 --> 13:00.494
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, that's to be expected.

13:00.594 --> 13:02.555
[SPEAKER_13]: But she still has some of her playfulness.

13:03.075 --> 13:05.736
[SPEAKER_13]: I took a really cute video earlier today of her playing with a string.

13:06.257 --> 13:09.138
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, we'll see.

13:09.758 --> 13:15.061
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll try to get her in as soon as we can when we can financially take care of it.

13:16.742 --> 13:18.263
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to some other comments in our chat room.

13:18.723 --> 13:19.724
[SPEAKER_13]: I like this from Breakman.

13:19.764 --> 13:20.405
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very good.

13:21.225 --> 13:26.189
[SPEAKER_13]: Cats and dogs are such a great part of our life, but they are so fragile and their time with us is far too short.

13:26.289 --> 13:27.070
[SPEAKER_13]: Ain't that the truth?

13:27.570 --> 13:28.751
[SPEAKER_13]: That is very much the truth.

13:29.592 --> 13:31.293
[SPEAKER_13]: GameGroove says, I'm sorry about your cat.

13:31.353 --> 13:33.255
[SPEAKER_13]: I've lost my last cat a few months ago.

13:34.015 --> 13:40.298
[SPEAKER_13]: It's tough, and especially the suddenness of it all and so forth is tough.

13:40.379 --> 13:45.141
[SPEAKER_13]: But anyway, I want to move on because how do we escape from reality?

13:45.221 --> 13:46.882
[SPEAKER_13]: By playing video games, right?

13:47.162 --> 13:48.163
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, not in my case.

13:48.263 --> 13:50.324
[SPEAKER_10]: I drank and cried for a night.

13:51.004 --> 13:51.284
[SPEAKER_13]: Mass Effect 3

14:18.826 --> 14:20.587
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

14:46.045 --> 14:49.347
[SPEAKER_10]: So I was quite happily surprised.

14:50.427 --> 14:54.589
[SPEAKER_10]: And I even checked it, you know, with other people.

14:54.889 --> 15:04.013
[SPEAKER_10]: I, you know, did a bunch of other stuff to make sure it wasn't just a, you know, what's the word I'm thinking of?

15:06.634 --> 15:09.315
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a whim, but just a one-off thing.

15:09.335 --> 15:09.595
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

15:10.263 --> 15:34.098
[SPEAKER_10]: and it kept working and so I was like everyone get a multiplayer right now so I played for a while with Shane and Tim and then I played again with Shane and Tim and Spike the other day and with my friend George and everything was fine I still kind of suck at it but I'm getting better and got a few levels in did the N7 challenge thing and

15:34.958 --> 15:35.258
[SPEAKER_13]: Fun!

15:35.538 --> 15:36.219
[SPEAKER_13]: So you got a banner.

15:36.759 --> 15:37.540
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I have.

15:37.880 --> 15:39.381
[SPEAKER_10]: And I wore my N7 shirt that day.

15:40.601 --> 15:47.425
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also went in just to see if it was like a completely new patch, so I tried to hack my game again.

15:48.186 --> 15:51.468
[SPEAKER_10]: And, well, more like hex-edited it so that I could get the console to unlock.

15:52.048 --> 15:54.990
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's at the same sector, it still works, so...

15:55.530 --> 16:04.457
[SPEAKER_10]: But everyone, if you're trying to do the hex edit based on what's on the Mass Effect wiki, it's not F4 for the last two numbers, it's F3.

16:04.777 --> 16:05.557
[SPEAKER_10]: Just letting you know.

16:07.058 --> 16:08.279
[SPEAKER_10]: I did that on... Don't screw that up.

16:08.599 --> 16:10.201
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I did it on... Because there's no F4.

16:11.121 --> 16:14.324
[SPEAKER_10]: I did the F3 on a win because I found the same sector, and it worked.

16:14.544 --> 16:16.525
[SPEAKER_10]: So, they have it on their wrong.

16:17.446 --> 16:23.050
[SPEAKER_10]: So, as I just said, Tiger Claw, you probably didn't hear, but I can play online again.

16:23.770 --> 16:49.220
[SPEAKER_10]: and I went back in on my DLC works and so that means I'm good to go for Omega but we're calling it the ghost patch because they didn't announce anything they didn't even acknowledge that there was a problem the only acknowledgement that I got was from some guy in customer service who actually worked with me for a long time and he said yeah we're noticing that there's a problem here we just can't say anything else about it right now

16:50.581 --> 16:52.883
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, really?

16:53.944 --> 16:54.564
[SPEAKER_13]: No comment?

16:54.705 --> 16:55.826
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't say anything on that?

16:56.967 --> 16:59.149
[SPEAKER_10]: He did more for me than the other people did.

17:00.350 --> 17:07.237
[SPEAKER_10]: But it did give me a nice little 30% off code, which I'm going to use for the Omega DLC.

17:09.202 --> 17:10.222
[SPEAKER_10]: So, very happy.

17:11.423 --> 17:14.163
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm playing through Mass Effect 2.

17:14.423 --> 17:20.805
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually did touch WoW long enough to log out while I was trying to make plans with you to go see Silent Hill.

17:21.525 --> 17:23.486
[SPEAKER_10]: I completely forgot that I was logged in and talking to you.

17:24.246 --> 17:25.586
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you guys go see Silent Hill?

17:25.706 --> 17:25.947
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

17:26.147 --> 17:27.567
[SPEAKER_13]: No, we still haven't made it out to see it.

17:28.018 --> 17:29.880
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right, I still haven't seen Wreck-It Ralph or something.

17:29.900 --> 17:31.141
[SPEAKER_13]: You need to do that.

17:31.902 --> 17:39.288
[SPEAKER_13]: BlackWolf has a smart-ass comment in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com in response to your fact that the information on the wiki is wrong.

17:39.328 --> 17:42.251
[SPEAKER_13]: He says, if only it was a wiki and everyone could edit it.

17:42.371 --> 17:45.394
[SPEAKER_10]: That means I have to log in for an account on it and I don't fucking feel like it.

17:45.974 --> 17:47.476
[SPEAKER_13]: That means I have to do work.

17:47.976 --> 17:48.617
[SPEAKER_13]: Wah.

17:48.937 --> 17:56.364
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the other thing, and I think I mentioned it last week, is now that I have a job, like a real job that's going to pay me some good money.

17:57.305 --> 17:57.946
[SPEAKER_13]: Hooray for money.

17:58.399 --> 18:16.191
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that I kind of haven't had much I haven't had a whole bunch of time to really do much except that the good thing about my job is that since I don't usually have to be in until 9 in the morning I can stay up till midnight and sleep in.

18:16.311 --> 18:19.473
[SPEAKER_10]: Who really feels like waking up early in the morning and gaming before work?

18:20.394 --> 18:21.014
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously?

18:22.135 --> 18:23.616
[SPEAKER_13]: Gaming is something you stay up all night and do.

18:23.676 --> 18:24.917
[SPEAKER_13]: You play games in the morning, Loki?

18:25.057 --> 18:27.979
[SPEAKER_13]: I would if I didn't have to get the baby up.

18:28.699 --> 18:30.000
[SPEAKER_13]: I like to stay up all night.

18:30.120 --> 18:31.201
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have children.

18:31.221 --> 18:31.881
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.

18:33.502 --> 18:35.283
[SPEAKER_13]: I've stayed up all night and done that still.

18:35.303 --> 18:37.104
[SPEAKER_13]: He's not really a baby anymore either.

18:37.144 --> 18:38.144
[SPEAKER_13]: He's more of a toddler.

18:39.065 --> 18:40.466
[SPEAKER_13]: Just saying.

18:40.566 --> 18:42.687
[SPEAKER_10]: Child.

18:42.927 --> 18:53.693
[SPEAKER_10]: At any rate, my schedule has actually been pretty perfect for gaming except that my work environment is so fast paced and I don't get paid days off which makes me a little sad but it's all good.

18:54.533 --> 18:55.234
[SPEAKER_10]: I love where I work.

18:55.374 --> 19:04.858
[SPEAKER_10]: It's in a small office in a house and I have so much freedom for my scheduling and for things that need to happen and I can wear socks.

19:05.018 --> 19:07.439
[SPEAKER_10]: I ask permission to wear my fuzzy socks in the office and I can do it.

19:08.239 --> 19:08.560
[SPEAKER_10]: It's great.

19:08.920 --> 19:10.300
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, so yeah.

19:10.881 --> 19:13.742
[SPEAKER_10]: My work allows me more game time so I will be playing more stuff.

19:14.662 --> 19:14.922
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome.

19:15.523 --> 19:16.483
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

19:17.203 --> 19:18.544
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Call of Duty Black Ops 2.

19:19.064 --> 19:20.605
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I know it's not out yet but

19:22.369 --> 19:23.410
[SPEAKER_05]: How's that gonna stop me?

19:44.202 --> 19:47.723
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I've been playing mainly the single-player campaign.

19:48.023 --> 19:52.424
[SPEAKER_05]: And really, that's kind of cool because I haven't played a lot of the single-player campaigns.

19:52.444 --> 20:01.485
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I played a bit of Modern Warfare 3 single-player campaign and totally hated it because they're really penalizing you with, like, shooting your teammates.

20:01.785 --> 20:07.166
[SPEAKER_05]: Not that I'm trying to shoot my teammates, but, like, everyone kind of blends in when it's so chaotic and stuff.

20:07.526 --> 20:09.367
[SPEAKER_05]: And it seems like Black Ops 2 isn't so...

20:11.107 --> 20:15.349
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm playing it on a super easy difficulty too because I just really care about the story.

20:15.369 --> 20:16.630
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't give a shit about the challenge.

20:18.591 --> 20:26.455
[SPEAKER_05]: But I haven't had that problem where, oh, you accidentally killed a teammate because he ran in front of you when you're firing a missile or something like that.

20:27.315 --> 20:31.217
[SPEAKER_05]: The story is fucking awesome.

20:31.297 --> 20:35.999
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really action-packed and I really enjoy it.

20:36.600 --> 20:44.103
[SPEAKER_05]: That's saying a lot considering a lot of times people consider the single-player campaign for these games to be a throwaway.

20:44.464 --> 20:47.325
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, oh, they have it on there, but it's really all about multiplayer.

20:47.865 --> 20:48.146
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft.com

21:08.186 --> 21:15.589
[SPEAKER_05]: The first kind of future warfare one that you're in, you're kind of swinging along this... It's like a mountainside or something like that.

21:16.369 --> 21:20.050
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're tethered to this other guy and you have these nano gloves that you can grip onto the rocks and stuff.

21:20.130 --> 21:25.052
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're scouting out this base that's kind of in a temple or something like that.

21:25.112 --> 21:28.394
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they put on their wingsuits and they fly down there.

21:28.494 --> 21:31.055
[SPEAKER_05]: And just that sequence is so fucking awesome.

21:31.115 --> 21:31.435
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just...

21:32.435 --> 21:33.395
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

21:54.602 --> 21:56.364
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

22:20.623 --> 22:22.485
[SPEAKER_05]: I swear to god that was a scene in Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter

22:35.560 --> 22:39.262
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's just, it's so like chaotic and awesome.

22:39.803 --> 22:41.423
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a really, I love it.

22:41.484 --> 22:42.264
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the campaign.

22:42.324 --> 22:46.727
[SPEAKER_05]: It really kind of makes me want to go back and try some of the other single player campaigns of the different games.

22:46.807 --> 22:51.870
[SPEAKER_05]: But just for some reason, this like kind of near future combat stuff is just really cool.

22:51.930 --> 22:54.511
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the storyline is actually, I think, really well done.

22:55.112 --> 22:57.013
[SPEAKER_05]: So definitely worth checking out.

22:57.133 --> 23:01.255
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, even if you're kind of thinking twice about it, it's just another Modern Warfare shooter game.

23:01.876 --> 23:02.656
[SPEAKER_05]: Check out the storyline.

23:02.676 --> 23:03.857
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually did a pretty good job on it.

23:04.817 --> 23:28.725
[SPEAKER_05]: um so besides that played a little bit more Minecraft been just trying to get you know plugins and stuff to work correctly with each other I'm working on finishing up the mob arena stuff so I have this magic spells um plugin that I added in there but I didn't realize it had a dependent plugin with this vault thing that I had to install in there so I'm still trying to get that all worked out and get the permission set correctly still kind of new to the whole bucket plugin stuff um and then noticed that

23:30.425 --> 23:35.470
[SPEAKER_05]: One of our other users, HitStun, had turned into Mr. Freeze and had frozen the jungles.

23:35.650 --> 23:36.931
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody chill!

23:37.772 --> 23:38.412
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously.

23:39.213 --> 23:42.496
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait a second, why can't I see out the roof of this mob arena I created?

23:43.196 --> 23:43.837
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going on here?

23:43.857 --> 23:44.818
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it just not drawing in?

23:44.878 --> 23:46.559
[SPEAKER_05]: I realize it's snow.

23:46.700 --> 23:50.943
[SPEAKER_13]: Leave it to HitStun or somebody to bring the League of Supervillains into the...

23:51.864 --> 23:52.765
[SPEAKER_13]: It was an accident.

23:52.805 --> 23:55.247
[SPEAKER_05]: He was working with WorldEdit.

23:55.307 --> 23:56.888
[SPEAKER_13]: It's always an accident.

23:57.108 --> 23:59.170
[SPEAKER_13]: That's how villains get created.

23:59.310 --> 24:00.271
[SPEAKER_05]: It was easy to fix.

24:00.411 --> 24:02.012
[SPEAKER_13]: Joker fell into that vat.

24:02.132 --> 24:03.873
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what happens when you play God.

24:04.494 --> 24:05.555
[SPEAKER_05]: Two commands and it was fixed.

24:05.575 --> 24:11.099
[SPEAKER_05]: But he's trying to make a... He was making a snow globe in the nether.

24:11.119 --> 24:19.786
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how that got out onto everything else, but there's snow in a bunch of the different chunks there, so I had to fix that.

24:20.386 --> 24:20.526
[SPEAKER_05]: But...

24:21.750 --> 24:23.310
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought it was hilarious there was snow in the jungle.

24:23.670 --> 24:25.211
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, there was snow all over the jungle.

24:25.271 --> 24:26.231
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, this is not right.

24:26.311 --> 24:27.791
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had to find the corners.

24:27.971 --> 24:29.252
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome to the jungle.

24:29.372 --> 24:30.432
[SPEAKER_10]: We got lots of snow.

24:33.072 --> 24:33.773
[SPEAKER_05]: So I fixed all that.

24:33.793 --> 24:37.373
[SPEAKER_05]: So I tried playing a little bit of Curiosity, but it wasn't working.

24:37.553 --> 24:38.434
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was that.

24:39.054 --> 24:42.554
[SPEAKER_05]: And Call of Duty Black Ops, or not Black Ops, Modern Warfare 3.

24:42.734 --> 24:45.415
[SPEAKER_05]: We've been playing multiplayer of that, and that's pretty fun.

24:45.615 --> 24:51.860
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually played a little bit of multiplayer in Black Ops 2 as well, the split screen stuff for system, actually just split screen stuff.

24:52.401 --> 25:04.912
[SPEAKER_05]: And because I was bored, I decided to take on nine AI characters that were the veteran difficulty, which is the hardest, and actually beat them because it's AI and you figure out the weaknesses in their pathfinding and away you go.

25:05.993 --> 25:06.433
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was that.

25:07.168 --> 25:08.249
[SPEAKER_10]: I forgot one other game I played.

25:08.909 --> 25:09.689
[SPEAKER_10]: Very Solitaire.

25:10.430 --> 25:11.550
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right, because it was free.

25:11.670 --> 25:12.531
[SPEAKER_13]: I played that too.

25:12.671 --> 25:13.811
[SPEAKER_13]: It was actually fun.

25:15.132 --> 25:16.092
[SPEAKER_13]: For a free game?

25:16.372 --> 25:17.173
[SPEAKER_13]: Better than Yaris.

25:17.633 --> 25:18.713
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a good time killer.

25:18.954 --> 25:20.974
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually had fun with it because I like hard games.

25:22.055 --> 25:23.456
[SPEAKER_10]: It reminded me of Neopets.

25:23.556 --> 25:25.777
[SPEAKER_13]: I wouldn't have minded paying a little bit of money for it.

25:25.837 --> 25:27.998
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think a lot of money, but it was cute.

25:28.638 --> 25:30.619
[SPEAKER_10]: I used to play Pyramid Solitaire on Neopets all the time.

25:30.679 --> 25:32.461
[SPEAKER_13]: That was a good tip, Actdeft, by the way, last week.

25:32.521 --> 25:38.905
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, and the last thing, one of the things that they've been hyping up about Black Ops 2 is these whole kind of like strike force missions.

25:39.365 --> 25:40.286
[SPEAKER_05]: They fucking suck.

25:40.546 --> 25:41.867
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate the strike force missions.

25:41.907 --> 25:43.988
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason why is because they're on the multiplayer maps.

25:44.068 --> 25:49.052
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically kind of like the strategy thing where you get a bunch of different troops and stuff and you can kind of...

25:49.572 --> 25:51.133
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, go here, defend this.

25:51.453 --> 25:52.554
[SPEAKER_05]: Go here, attack this.

25:52.834 --> 25:54.215
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can jump into each of them.

25:54.235 --> 25:57.557
[SPEAKER_05]: It's supposed to add this strategy element to it.

25:57.898 --> 26:01.120
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem is, though, is the controlling of that stuff is really terrible.

26:01.500 --> 26:06.683
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you're telling your troops to go here, and then you're trying to select one soldier, and it's selecting all of them.

26:06.803 --> 26:11.747
[SPEAKER_05]: I found it more efficient for me to go into a soldier and just do the mission myself.

26:13.067 --> 26:16.930
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of the only poo-poo thing about Black Ops 2 right now.

26:17.851 --> 26:22.396
[SPEAKER_13]: HaloMan in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, today's headline, Loki loves a game.

26:22.457 --> 26:24.739
[SPEAKER_13]: Tomorrow's headline, the Mayans have been proven to be right.

26:25.660 --> 26:27.803
[SPEAKER_13]: Dude, I love games all the time.

26:28.623 --> 26:30.005
[SPEAKER_05]: Grand Theft Auto, hello.

26:30.325 --> 26:30.726
[SPEAKER_13]: That is true.

26:30.746 --> 26:32.227
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, Halo 4 made me nauseous.

26:32.848 --> 26:36.650
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, if you're done with your gaming week, I want to quickly talk about mine.

26:36.710 --> 26:43.634
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have a whole lot of time because we're running a little late for Eddie's interview because we got a late start tonight.

26:43.694 --> 26:47.477
[SPEAKER_13]: But I want to quickly talk about a couple games because I did play some new stuff this week.

26:47.957 --> 26:49.758
[SPEAKER_13]: One of them is Halo 4.

26:49.898 --> 26:51.559
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, me, Halo.

26:51.839 --> 26:52.139
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh-huh.

26:52.360 --> 26:52.800
[SPEAKER_13]: I bought it.

26:53.780 --> 26:56.181
[SPEAKER_13]: Keep in mind, I've been out of the Halo franchise for a little bit.

26:56.281 --> 26:59.102
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't buy ODST, I didn't buy Anniversary, I didn't buy Reach.

26:59.122 --> 27:00.542
[SPEAKER_13]: The last Halo game I bought was Halo 3.

27:01.262 --> 27:06.484
[SPEAKER_13]: And I didn't love Halo 3 because I didn't have a lot of friends that were online playing the multiplayer.

27:06.664 --> 27:08.664
[SPEAKER_13]: And for me, that's kind of where it's at in Halo.

27:09.084 --> 27:10.785
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't get into the story mode too much.

27:11.865 --> 27:16.126
[SPEAKER_13]: So Halo 4 is kind of a new boot to the series because it's a new developer.

27:16.247 --> 27:17.507
[SPEAKER_13]: It's 343 Industries.

27:18.027 --> 27:19.968
[SPEAKER_13]: And I did play a little bit of the campaign.

27:20.008 --> 27:21.648
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm only through like the first two chapters.

27:21.668 --> 27:23.749
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm not going to try to speak with authority or anything.

27:24.109 --> 27:26.390
[SPEAKER_13]: But I will say it's interesting.

27:26.890 --> 27:32.732
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel a little lost because I'm not as familiar with all the backstory and so forth.

27:32.792 --> 27:36.973
[SPEAKER_13]: But I can pick up enough of what's going on that I'm not like hating it.

27:37.573 --> 27:52.023
[SPEAKER_13]: and at the end of the day the story is really about the relationship between Master Chief and Cortana any review outlet that's talked about this game is going to tell you that so I don't think you need to know too much more to really get into the series but for me

27:52.984 --> 27:54.845
[SPEAKER_13]: It's always been multiplayer is where it's at.

27:55.345 --> 27:56.265
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've been having fun.

27:56.285 --> 27:59.306
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a group of about four of us that have been playing multiplayer online.

27:59.606 --> 28:01.047
[SPEAKER_13]: And we've been trying out all the modes.

28:01.807 --> 28:06.008
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, King of the Hill, Oddball, all the stuff you know from the old games.

28:06.108 --> 28:06.848
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, Slayer.

28:07.809 --> 28:09.989
[SPEAKER_13]: But there's a couple fun new ones.

28:10.029 --> 28:14.751
[SPEAKER_13]: And I gotta say, I had a great time playing Flood, which is one of the new game modes.

28:15.391 --> 28:17.052
[SPEAKER_13]: and DarkSakura.com

28:40.703 --> 28:41.283
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

28:57.808 --> 28:59.510
[SPEAKER_13]: For a good time, just add Flood.

28:59.950 --> 29:01.671
[SPEAKER_13]: And then there was this other mode we played.

29:01.691 --> 29:03.493
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it was like Gryffin Ball or something like that.

29:03.573 --> 29:04.073
[SPEAKER_13]: Gryff Ball.

29:04.193 --> 29:04.734
[SPEAKER_13]: Gryff Ball.

29:04.834 --> 29:07.476
[SPEAKER_13]: And it said in the – like all the other ones have description.

29:07.776 --> 29:12.580
[SPEAKER_13]: And for Gryff Ball, it said just add Awesome or prepare for Awesome or something like that.

29:13.241 --> 29:16.724
[SPEAKER_13]: So we go in this mode and all it is is you have the gigantic –

29:17.304 --> 29:18.445
[SPEAKER_13]: Gravity Hammers.

29:19.086 --> 29:20.867
[SPEAKER_13]: You can either have a hammer or a sword.

29:21.007 --> 29:23.970
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's just a game of get the ball into the goal.

29:23.990 --> 29:29.275
[SPEAKER_13]: But you have these giant hammers that you're either knocking the ball around with or the other players.

29:30.592 --> 29:34.655
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that shit was really funny, actually, even though we got beat bad.

29:35.095 --> 29:41.119
[SPEAKER_13]: Like it was Shane and I versus Spike from Game Buoy Podcast and Tim.

29:41.720 --> 29:43.361
[SPEAKER_13]: It was two on two.

29:44.522 --> 29:47.064
[SPEAKER_13]: They wiped the floor with us, like five points to nothing.

29:47.124 --> 29:48.284
[SPEAKER_13]: It was depressing.

29:48.885 --> 29:49.745
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, that was...

29:50.566 --> 29:51.247
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for watching!

30:08.800 --> 30:12.523
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure the story mode's great too.

30:13.224 --> 30:18.209
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody says great things about it on the internet, but I'm not as into the lore and all that stuff, so I'm like, okay, yeah.

30:18.549 --> 30:19.830
[SPEAKER_13]: The presentation's really good.

30:20.290 --> 30:23.774
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a pretty cool scene in the beginning where you're climbing up a wall, and it's kind of neat.

30:25.415 --> 30:28.878
[SPEAKER_13]: The other game I want to talk quickly about, LittleBigPlanet Karting, I picked up on the PlayStation 3.

30:29.238 --> 30:32.521
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't played a lot of it because I've been too busy with multiplayer on Halo 4, but...

30:34.563 --> 30:35.063
[SPEAKER_13]: I like it.

30:35.283 --> 30:47.946
[SPEAKER_13]: It really does feel like a fusion of Mod Nation Racers and LittleBigPlanet, which is to obviously no one's surprise because it's the same developers of Mod Nation Racers with all the LittleBigPlanet stuff in it.

30:48.306 --> 30:49.346
[SPEAKER_13]: It controls great.

30:49.726 --> 30:50.307
[SPEAKER_13]: It's fun.

30:50.987 --> 30:53.707
[SPEAKER_13]: I noticed there weren't a lot of people online to race against.

30:53.747 --> 30:54.828
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure what's up with that.

30:55.248 --> 30:58.048
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe because the game's so new and everybody's distracted with Halo 4.

30:58.108 --> 30:59.489
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just on at a weird time.

31:00.009 --> 31:00.949
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, so...

31:01.349 --> 31:07.395
[SPEAKER_13]: So far, I'm liking LittleBigPlanet karting, but I need more time with it to give you my full opinions.

31:08.196 --> 31:11.779
[SPEAKER_13]: The other games I'll talk about real quick, Curiosity, What's in the Cube?

31:12.279 --> 31:14.882
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think that's really a game, and we shouldn't call it a game.

31:14.922 --> 31:16.704
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just a weird thing.

31:17.384 --> 31:24.371
[SPEAKER_13]: They're having those server problems left and right, which is really unfortunate, but I like the zen-ness of being able to just sit there and

31:27.148 --> 31:34.250
[SPEAKER_13]: And kind of figure out the way to get huge combos of coins and so forth I was able to get enough coins So what do you do with the coins?

31:34.610 --> 31:54.816
[SPEAKER_13]: You can buy items that will let you break bricks faster See, that was the thing, the shop wouldn't even open up for me Because it was so lagged out I got this pick that let you do 3x3 bricks when you would tap And you can rack up your combos so much faster when you do that And doing the little random tappings are much more fruitful when you do that So, kind of neat

31:55.536 --> 32:03.823
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, but anyway, Curiosity, not really a game, and they're having a lot of server problems, but it's free, better than Yaris, a little bit.

32:05.284 --> 32:18.094
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, the one other thing I want to talk about, since we are about to have a Bomani-centric interview here in a minute, ReflectBeat is out on the iOS systems now, and you can get that on iPad or iPhone, and I've been playing a little bit of ReflectBeat on the iPad.

32:18.615 --> 32:22.778
[SPEAKER_13]: I did not know much about this game, honestly, I've been out of the loop of a lot of the Bomani stuff, but

32:23.038 --> 32:48.660
[SPEAKER_13]: so you know again it's free you only get three songs because they're trying to sell you the song packs that's where they're making the money but it was different I want to try some like verses and try to like play against somebody because I think that would be where the game would because there's more of a versus element to it where if you hit certain notes they'll actually bounce back to the other side and the other player has to hit them so that's kind of neat that was kind of fun a little different

32:49.420 --> 32:56.064
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyhow, we are going to, I'm running a little late here, so I want to get this in here, an interview.

32:57.205 --> 33:06.410
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm so happy to welcome to the show, Eddie from BamaniStyle.com, a long-running website about music gaming and music game culture.

33:06.730 --> 33:11.273
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to bring him on the line, talk to him about what's going on in the music game world.

33:11.333 --> 33:12.074
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, Eddie, you there?

33:12.094 --> 33:13.394
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, can you hear me?

33:13.555 --> 33:14.555
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, we can hear you just fine.

33:14.575 --> 33:15.095
[SPEAKER_13]: How you doing, Eddie?

33:15.636 --> 33:16.316
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm doing all right.

33:16.756 --> 33:17.937
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much for coming on the show.

33:17.957 --> 33:19.178
[SPEAKER_13]: It only took about 10 years, right?

33:20.231 --> 33:20.852
[SPEAKER_00]: Just about, yeah.

33:30.626 --> 33:31.646
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, I appreciate it.

33:32.166 --> 33:35.367
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, well, let's just start with some questions.

33:35.427 --> 33:43.309
[SPEAKER_13]: If you guys have questions for Eddie, I know we probably have some of the Bomani-style community listening tonight, and I know we have some long-time fans of music gaming listening tonight.

33:43.649 --> 33:48.870
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want to ask a question at live.vognetwork.com, just pop into the chat room and ask away.

33:48.910 --> 33:51.411
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll read some of the questions here a little later.

33:51.911 --> 33:52.611
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, DarkSakura?

33:52.731 --> 33:55.132
[SPEAKER_10]: What is the airspeed velocity of an Aladdin swallow?

33:55.192 --> 33:55.412
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no.

33:56.012 --> 33:57.652
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to ask him on top of things.

33:58.153 --> 33:59.113
[SPEAKER_13]: Not a six-hour show.

34:00.245 --> 34:02.366
[SPEAKER_13]: So, Eddie, tell us a little bit about your website.

34:02.446 --> 34:06.046
[SPEAKER_13]: Tell us about where BomaniStyle.com came from.

34:06.186 --> 34:06.827
[SPEAKER_13]: How did it start?

34:08.907 --> 34:13.808
[SPEAKER_00]: Funny enough, it actually started kind of as a result of DDR Spot.

34:13.968 --> 34:18.589
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys remember that site or not, but some of the old NorCal players started that up years ago.

34:18.609 --> 34:21.950
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of like a competitor to DDR Freak.

34:23.971 --> 34:28.172
[SPEAKER_00]: Mike Ngo was in Michigan for a tournament way back in 2001.

34:29.856 --> 34:42.028
[SPEAKER_00]: and we ran into each other and got to talking and at the time it was like me, him, the owner of TeamGuilo.net which was a Canadian site and a friend of mine from the New England area named Malcolm.

34:42.048 --> 34:48.634
[SPEAKER_00]: We were all talking about making this just gigantic site to cover all music games because as it had standed like only...

34:50.103 --> 34:51.304
[SPEAKER_00]: DDR was being talked about.

34:51.484 --> 34:58.069
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone was kind of ignoring the other games and that wasn't really what I was jiving with personally because I like the 5-key stuff a lot.

34:59.130 --> 35:05.154
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of ego that got in the way from the other two sites and nothing bad.

35:05.194 --> 35:19.325
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't like we were fighting or anything but there were a lot of arguments about the name and everything so Malcolm and I just kind of splintered off and decided to start Bimani style on our own and it was an early effort by me, him, some guys from the Midwest and

35:19.983 --> 35:25.906
[SPEAKER_00]: A handful of people we knew in Japan to just get more word out about the other series that people weren't playing at the time.

35:26.626 --> 35:36.151
[SPEAKER_13]: You've been very successful at BomaniStyle.com because it's really evolved into a place now where I know for a while you were doing some type of record distribution or record stuff, right?

35:36.691 --> 35:37.932
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still doing that actually.

35:39.033 --> 35:40.693
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of like a weird situation.

35:42.361 --> 35:44.222
[SPEAKER_00]: I did Slake's CD in the U.S.

35:45.283 --> 35:46.144
[SPEAKER_00]: back in 2006.

35:47.245 --> 35:54.030
[SPEAKER_00]: And a year later, we got in touch with DJ Chucky and the guys from Groovy about bringing them out to the U.S.

35:54.090 --> 35:55.190
[SPEAKER_00]: to play at Anime Central.

35:55.831 --> 36:00.774
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of spiraled into us distributing their albums in North America.

36:01.575 --> 36:03.857
[SPEAKER_00]: More Japanese hardcore stuff, not Bimani-centric.

36:03.897 --> 36:06.298
[SPEAKER_00]: But ever since we did that, we've had...

36:07.728 --> 36:27.562
[SPEAKER_00]: you know M Project, DJ Chucky, No Chin, Groovy, Chorus K, Red Alice, Jackazid just a number of people have been featured in all these music games out to Chicago for the Anime Central show that we do every year so that's kind of like where that project is we're actually right now in the planning stages for our 2013 show so it's still going on

36:27.998 --> 36:28.339
[SPEAKER_13]: Awesome.

36:28.379 --> 36:30.601
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's kind of the place to be is Anime Central.

36:30.641 --> 36:38.049
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want to see some of these artists that kind of started in music games, I guess, or I guess maybe known over here from that or whatever you want to say.

36:39.390 --> 36:40.992
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

36:41.312 --> 36:43.094
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you think has kept Bomani style?

36:43.114 --> 36:49.601
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you know, we just saw DDR Freak, you know, you kind of mentioned that Bomani style kind of started as a, it was meant to be

36:50.101 --> 36:53.243
[SPEAKER_13]: somewhat like DDR Freak but more inclusive of the other music games.

36:53.323 --> 36:56.385
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, obviously DDR Spot and they shut down a long time ago.

36:56.745 --> 37:02.089
[SPEAKER_13]: DDR Freak just recently in the past year finally sunsetted and said, you know, party's over.

37:03.190 --> 37:11.615
[SPEAKER_13]: How do you think Bomani Style, what's kept Bomani Style above that and alive in light of these other sites sunsetting?

37:12.014 --> 37:18.857
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, you know, one thing when it comes to running a website, ultimately, if it closes, that's the decision of the person who owns the website.

37:19.037 --> 37:31.642
[SPEAKER_00]: And quite frankly, you know, my feelings on it are even when I have my low points, which, you know, got us talking what a week ago, a Facebook post that I made about how the community has been lately.

37:32.543 --> 37:46.723
[SPEAKER_00]: even when I've had my low points I just look at it as though I've been doing this site for 10 years how can you just walk away from something like that especially when people are still using it so I think it's just there's a genuine interest from a lot of people who are really diehard fans for that information on

37:47.544 --> 37:50.125
[SPEAKER_00]: The more global games, stuff that's not released over here.

37:50.165 --> 37:57.508
[SPEAKER_00]: And then at the same time, there are people who are more casual that are into maybe just the music and they like knowing when new songs are coming out.

37:57.548 --> 37:58.328
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't play the games.

37:58.348 --> 37:59.348
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want to know about the music.

37:59.388 --> 38:04.890
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a variety of things, but the community's kind of stuck with us and I'm just really not ready to let it go.

38:05.110 --> 38:07.431
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just sticking with it as long as I can.

38:08.851 --> 38:14.075
[SPEAKER_13]: Since you brought up Facebook and all that, where is the community at these days, you think?

38:14.195 --> 38:15.816
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the music game community?

38:15.996 --> 38:16.477
[SPEAKER_00]: It's split.

38:16.537 --> 38:24.142
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of weird because you kind of have splinter groups now in regards to what games people are playing and what mentalities everybody has.

38:25.883 --> 38:30.666
[SPEAKER_00]: Konami has not really been doing a lot to help the community over here in the U.S.

38:30.946 --> 38:32.207
[SPEAKER_00]: They never really have.

38:32.447 --> 38:34.529
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been attempts in the past, you know.

38:35.029 --> 38:40.576
[SPEAKER_00]: with Beatmania and the home version DDRs that came out early on and DDR continuing on for years.

38:40.656 --> 38:44.541
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately, you know, the hardcore fans kind of

38:45.663 --> 38:47.105
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

39:05.785 --> 39:06.226
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura,

39:22.958 --> 39:31.341
[SPEAKER_00]: On the outside, it looks as though the community has just degenerated to this massive negativity, this massive group of negativity.

39:31.401 --> 39:36.642
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just tired of not getting any of the games and being ignored and so on and so forth.

39:37.042 --> 39:45.185
[SPEAKER_00]: So you run into situations like what's happening right now with the DJ Max community, who, for the most part, ever since Technica came out, have just been...

39:45.765 --> 39:46.286
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching!

39:55.310 --> 40:22.578
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone starts complaining or starts just outright talking shit about the company that makes the game not really looking at it from their perspective but saying like hey this is what I want why aren't you doing what I want you to do and so that tends to stand out over the people who are a little bit more positive and understanding about everything so from the outside looking in I think the music game community kind of comes off as though it's not very welcoming as of late and I've had my criticisms over

40:23.311 --> 40:26.814
[SPEAKER_00]: and just the general attitudes of people for a long time.

40:26.854 --> 40:36.083
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think there's still just a ton of love for the games and the hardcore players are a little bit more vocal about what they expect than the people who play them a little bit more casually.

40:37.704 --> 40:52.795
[SPEAKER_13]: Since you were talking about Konami and the difficult position they've been in for many years and so forth, although I don't know, I kind of think that all the United States progress for DDR, anything they had going for it, kind of went away when Redmond and Hawaii both went away.

40:52.855 --> 40:55.177
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that was pretty much the end of that, right?

40:55.917 --> 40:58.059
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't necessarily say that.

40:58.099 --> 40:58.639
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that...

40:59.864 --> 41:01.305
[SPEAKER_00]: from a player expectation.

41:01.405 --> 41:03.466
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of that went away because they lost that connection.

41:03.506 --> 41:11.390
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when they were doing the games in Redmond, especially, I mean, the guys working on the games were fans of DDR.

41:11.650 --> 41:14.331
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them were really old school NorCal and SoCal players.

41:15.092 --> 41:18.453
[SPEAKER_00]: So that connection to the community definitely went away.

41:18.473 --> 41:19.854
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that caused a lot of problems.

41:22.330 --> 41:24.610
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that the momentum went away, so to speak.

41:24.771 --> 41:32.072
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the momentum went away when Konami wasn't really being as hands-on with certain projects as they used to be.

41:32.552 --> 41:35.493
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'd see things like the Wii games coming out.

41:35.593 --> 41:37.233
[SPEAKER_00]: I think were a fantastic effort.

41:37.293 --> 41:38.613
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they did a really good job with those.

41:39.053 --> 41:42.174
[SPEAKER_00]: The Xbox and the PS3 versions were kind of whatever.

41:42.234 --> 41:43.714
[SPEAKER_00]: The song lists weren't fantastic.

41:43.754 --> 41:45.694
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, they were still very traditional DDR games.

41:45.714 --> 41:47.255
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you look at the arcade side of things.

41:49.927 --> 42:04.280
[SPEAKER_00]: After not ever making an attempt in North America with the arcade releases before Xtreme, I mean, there was the original DDR 1.5 in the US, and then there was DDR USA, but honestly, neither of them were really valiant efforts on their behalf.

42:05.381 --> 42:09.985
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of ignored everything for a long time, and then the In The Groove thing happened, and there was a lot of just...

42:11.587 --> 42:12.669
[SPEAKER_00]: and I personally think were great and uh

42:23.550 --> 42:27.511
[SPEAKER_00]: Those two, like those two games in particular, I think were a really good effort on their behalf.

42:27.851 --> 42:36.394
[SPEAKER_00]: But then X and X2 came out and it was just letting the wrong people handle the franchise, handle the development of these cabinets and do the release and everything.

42:36.474 --> 42:39.235
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got kind of like a shoddy product.

42:39.455 --> 42:41.096
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, not even kind of a shoddy product.

42:41.156 --> 42:42.376
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really a shoddy product.

42:43.236 --> 42:46.697
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of people just kind of got fed up with it and walked away from it.

42:46.998 --> 42:51.099
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, I want to clear this up too in regards to the arcade stuff because I know a lot of people bring this up, but

42:52.310 --> 43:21.951
[SPEAKER_00]: DDRX2 kind of had the same problems as DDRX1 did where they were lowering the cost of production on the games and you could tell that the quality went down a lot especially in the dance pads and they made a conscious effort to try to fix the problems from X to X2 because myself and some friends of mine were brought in to consult with them specifically on the arcade release to make sure certain things were up to snuff and when we had seen them everything was functioning perfectly fine and

43:22.463 --> 43:27.965
[SPEAKER_00]: and Timing was fantastic and the games were actually really good quality and X2 as a mix is like one of my favorites in a long time.

43:28.445 --> 43:41.770
[SPEAKER_00]: And then somewhere between when we did our testing work with them and the actual release, something changed and the final product that we got just ended up being this shoddy mess that constantly ends up in a state of disrepair and is almost unplayable.

43:43.224 --> 43:56.934
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me go to the chat, because there's quite a few comments going on in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com First off, Shane Alenko is saying, we worked at Redwood City, not Redmond Oops, my bad, sorry, I was thinking of the wrong video game company, apparently My bad, my bad Mass effect on the brain?

43:57.034 --> 44:06.201
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently, apparently Let's see, YYR saying, I still believe that Supernova happened because In The Groove happened And a few folks agreeing with him, what do you think?

44:08.043 --> 44:09.925
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that that's the case at all, actually.

44:10.326 --> 44:19.117
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people look at that because of the timing of the whole thing, but a lot of people also don't remember what it was like when Extreme came out.

44:19.678 --> 44:22.642
[SPEAKER_00]: And when Extreme was in testing, they had always been saying that

44:22.882 --> 44:23.523
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

44:46.758 --> 44:54.303
[SPEAKER_00]: In between the period of time from Extreme to Supernova, they had released Dancing Stage Fusion in the UK, which used kind of like the middleware hardware.

44:55.063 --> 45:03.768
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the same hardware that Poppin' Music used, so it was a PS2-based hardware, and it didn't use Magic Gate protection, but it was still pretty uncrackable.

45:04.455 --> 45:14.761
[SPEAKER_00]: and finally they settled on the hardware that was used which was basically a PS2 in a box with an IO board that plugged into everything and had its issues with hard drives dying and all that other crap.

45:14.781 --> 45:20.605
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think a lot of the delay had more to do with them just trying to get a lockdown on the issues with all the bootlegging.

45:22.027 --> 45:35.541
[SPEAKER_13]: Since we're talking about reboots and all this stuff and where DDR is heading, this news came up very recently, even after I asked you to come on the show originally, that is that there is this Dance Dance Revolution reboot that's location testing in Japan right now.

45:36.462 --> 45:37.203
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you think about this?

45:37.283 --> 45:38.624
[SPEAKER_13]: Good idea for the series?

45:39.004 --> 45:39.745
[SPEAKER_13]: Bad idea?

45:40.286 --> 45:41.066
[SPEAKER_13]: Not going to go anywhere?

45:41.086 --> 45:41.507
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you think?

45:41.800 --> 45:42.040
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Ranma S,

46:02.401 --> 46:11.452
[SPEAKER_00]: Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania are getting reset as Guitadora, which is basically just like the XG games in a shiny white cabinet and no second player guitar on the Guitar Freaks version.

46:11.612 --> 46:15.356
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you saying that everything's going the way of Apple, where now it's the new DDR?

46:16.798 --> 46:22.164
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that's what people are going to end up calling it, DDR 2013, which is what people are calling it right now.

46:22.285 --> 46:22.445
[SPEAKER_00]: But

46:23.265 --> 46:33.289
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that what they're doing is they're actually kind of going the Rock Band model with everything and they're setting it up to be a platform as opposed to being something that you get yearly upgrades on.

46:33.689 --> 46:51.035
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a new pricing model for the arcades in Japan that they just rolled out with the newest Beatmania where the arcades pay a subsidized rate for the hardware and the game itself and then Konami kind of forces a profit share on the game through their Pacelli and e-amusement networks so every month the arcades

46:51.295 --> 46:51.575
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on.

47:08.962 --> 47:15.406
[SPEAKER_00]: Every six months or so, they're going to push out another 30 or 40 songs and a UI update and possibly new features and stuff.

47:15.726 --> 47:27.933
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that this is less of a reboot and more of a way to restructure the way they do things based on how the arcade market has been declining everywhere in the world.

47:28.234 --> 47:35.258
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a conscious effort to try to do something that arcade operators can work with but doesn't leave them in the hole at the end of the day.

47:36.810 --> 47:38.851
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is like the 11th Doctor of DVR.

47:39.431 --> 47:40.012
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of, sort of.

47:40.532 --> 47:45.934
[SPEAKER_05]: It just sounds like they're forcing them basically to buy and upgrade each year because it's being subsidized throughout the entire year.

47:46.275 --> 48:03.543
[SPEAKER_05]: And with the good faith that they're actually going to put out 30 to 40 songs or whatever for the next update, which, let's be honest, compared to what I've seen with the home releases and what they support DLC-wise, I'll be interested to see if they actually continue on with that after at least one update.

48:04.825 --> 48:06.968
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, though, I don't think that that's going to be the case.

48:06.988 --> 48:14.661
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think the CS games are at all indicative of what they're doing with the arcade stuff because they've been doing download content on the arcade games for a few versions now.

48:14.681 --> 48:15.101
[SPEAKER_00]: 2DX18 had

48:17.173 --> 48:17.693
[SPEAKER_00]: and DarkSakura.

48:43.593 --> 49:09.325
[SPEAKER_00]: if people are continuing to play the games then the operators are going to stick with the service and they're going to stay subscribed to the amusement network and everything so it doesn't really benefit Konami at all to not stick with it and at the same time it costs them way less in development to do something like this than it would for them to crank out a new game every 8 to 12 months like they've done for the past 10 years of the series existence How does something like that work though for importers over in the US?

49:10.545 --> 49:12.366
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of left to be unsaid right now I mean

49:13.156 --> 49:15.797
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't been making any of the games really available for a while.

49:15.917 --> 49:21.018
[SPEAKER_00]: DDR was available, but it was available on such sketchy, you know, circumstances.

49:21.218 --> 49:32.481
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to buy, for X and X2, you had to buy a new machine from Betson, and then there were these crap machines that would break down, so you'd end up spending more money in repairing the game than you would make back, and you would never pay off the machine.

49:32.541 --> 49:34.021
[SPEAKER_00]: That happened to a lot of arcades out here.

49:34.621 --> 49:41.723
[SPEAKER_00]: In regards to 2DX and Poppin' Music and Guitar Freaks and Drummania and, you know, like Ubeat and Reflectbeat don't even really exist over here outside of, like,

49:42.540 --> 49:44.622
[SPEAKER_00]: three locations.

49:44.682 --> 49:46.703
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them isn't even an arcade that have a UB machine.

49:48.465 --> 49:55.310
[SPEAKER_00]: They've never been available out here as upgrade kits because historically there just wasn't a lot of interest from the arcade operators for it.

49:55.350 --> 50:01.675
[SPEAKER_00]: Like even when they did the location tests for 2DX14 and they did the UB location tests down here in Southern California.

50:01.795 --> 50:05.377
[SPEAKER_00]: So for importers, it really has...

50:07.273 --> 50:08.354
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching!

50:24.164 --> 50:25.585
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's really going to affect them at all.

50:44.946 --> 50:45.446
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

51:09.309 --> 51:38.979
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been shopping the games around a few arcade distributors out here nothing's set in stone or anything like that but ever since they dropped Betson as their lead distributor they have been making attempts to try to find someone else out here to handle the stuff so it's really just kind of hard to say where it's going to go at this point it's the state of the arcade industry in North America that nobody wants to take risks on anything that's going to cost money and I think that that might end up hurting it more than Konami's unwillingness to release anything

51:39.099 --> 51:39.880
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

51:57.493 --> 52:00.916
[SPEAKER_00]: Think back to 10 years ago when DDR first started getting popular in the US.

52:01.156 --> 52:06.700
[SPEAKER_00]: Arcades had been dead since Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter II.

52:07.341 --> 52:08.281
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it as a cycle.

52:08.341 --> 52:10.223
[SPEAKER_00]: I see the whole arcade industry as a cycle.

52:10.663 --> 52:15.206
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to deviate too much from the conversation, but a lot of the operators are old.

52:19.665 --> 52:20.265
[SPEAKER_00]: Older guys.

52:20.305 --> 52:26.189
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a handful of younger guys who have been starting up their own places, but a lot of arcade operators are older guys that just don't want to take risks on stuff anymore.

52:26.569 --> 52:27.989
[SPEAKER_00]: So redemption kind of rules.

52:28.110 --> 52:31.471
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the king of the arcade space right now because that's what's making money.

52:31.832 --> 52:36.254
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of laws that have been brought to light.

52:36.414 --> 52:40.236
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not actually laws, but there's a lot of laws that are being proposed right now to kind of

52:40.734 --> 52:43.855
[SPEAKER_00]: Kill the Redemption Market because it's essentially gambling for children.

52:56.801 --> 53:14.371
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the arcade industry as a whole missed its entire mark with that movie I think that that would have been a perfect chance for them to maybe appeal to Disney to do some more cross promotion and get people out to their locations and bring some life back to the arcades again and nobody capitalized that at all there's always a DVD release

53:15.134 --> 53:17.695
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but you know, it's still going to be limited at that point.

53:17.735 --> 53:19.735
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's better to strike when the iron's hot.

53:19.795 --> 53:24.717
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to a movie theater up here to see it and they had like two arcade games in the entire place.

53:25.497 --> 53:29.458
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd think that a movie theater who's expecting, and it's like the number one movie in America right now.

53:29.538 --> 53:35.260
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, wouldn't that get you to go to your route operators and be like, hey, get some more stuff in here right away.

53:35.300 --> 53:36.600
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some extra space for you.

53:36.640 --> 53:39.781
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring in like a Pac-Man or bring in a racing game or something like that.

53:39.881 --> 53:43.662
[SPEAKER_13]: Or one of those Wreck-It Ralph cabinets that they made, you know, just for fun.

53:44.082 --> 53:44.682
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching!

54:05.093 --> 54:07.655
[SPEAKER_00]: I still think Electronic had kind of missed its point a little bit too.

54:08.576 --> 54:13.039
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm really critical of the arcade industry, so I'm not really the right guy to talk about something like that.

54:13.199 --> 54:13.580
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.

54:16.253 --> 54:20.615
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing with the Wreck-It Ralph machines is that they're converted Donkey Kong cabinets.

54:21.115 --> 54:28.338
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like there's a plethora of those available for them to just fix up and clean up and throw the game into.

54:28.598 --> 54:30.899
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure they worked within their means to get that released.

54:31.439 --> 54:34.261
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, yeah, they could hobble something together and release it.

54:34.281 --> 54:41.804
[SPEAKER_00]: But where I think they really missed the mark, and me and a friend of mine was talking about this at an arcade auction last week, why didn't they make a game based on Sugar Rush?

54:42.554 --> 54:53.058
[SPEAKER_00]: How hard would it be to throw a skin on a racing game and add in some of the features that were featured in the movie that were kind of talked about with that game and then push it out as an arcade game?

54:53.238 --> 54:57.840
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the missed cross-promotion opportunity of the year right there.

54:58.480 --> 55:02.782
[SPEAKER_10]: You know you market that in Japan with AKB48 doing the soundtrack and your set.

55:03.142 --> 55:05.423
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it'd be the new Maximum Tune.

55:05.751 --> 55:08.452
[SPEAKER_10]: I swear I was listening to the end credits going, is that AKB48?

55:08.512 --> 55:10.553
[SPEAKER_10]: It is AKB48!

55:11.853 --> 55:17.055
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that was kind of big news in the J-pop community, like, kind of how perfume being in Cars 2 was.

55:17.576 --> 55:19.436
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that kind of got a lot of people talking.

55:19.496 --> 55:25.759
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think they're, I love the movie, it was fantastic, but I think the whole industry kind of missed a lot of points.

55:25.799 --> 55:31.361
[SPEAKER_00]: All the cameos were fantastic, but I think, you know, people didn't really handle the release of that movie properly.

55:31.381 --> 55:33.102
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there was enough faith placed in it.

55:33.562 --> 55:33.762
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

55:34.867 --> 55:39.369
[SPEAKER_13]: I got just a couple more questions for you, and then I want to go to the chat to see if they have anything.

55:39.589 --> 55:41.090
[SPEAKER_13]: I already see a few things popping up here.

55:41.490 --> 55:52.356
[SPEAKER_13]: But I've been dying to ask you this for years, and this is a very controversial question within the community, but I have to know what you think about this one being so vested in the community and so forth.

55:53.697 --> 55:57.839
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's about Guitar Hero, and I know this is like, hello, five years ago, but...

55:58.499 --> 56:01.120
[SPEAKER_13]: When this game took off, there was a lot of people in the community.

56:01.600 --> 56:07.562
[SPEAKER_13]: They thought Konami was robbed of Guitar Freaks and Guitar Hero has just come in and taken all the credit.

56:07.962 --> 56:14.564
[SPEAKER_13]: We all remember that review that X-Play did of Beatmania that was ridiculous where they said it was ripping off Guitar Hero and all that.

56:15.144 --> 56:23.147
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you think Guitar Hero, at the end of the day, was it a good thing or was it a bad thing for American fans of Japanese music games?

56:24.016 --> 56:34.381
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Guitar Hero before Red Octane was purchased by Activision was a fantastic thing for the music game community in the US.

56:35.082 --> 56:39.124
[SPEAKER_00]: Before the game was even announced to the public, I got a chance to see it.

56:40.205 --> 56:42.426
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hooked up with the guys at Red Octane.

56:42.446 --> 56:46.748
[SPEAKER_00]: They brought me in to see it shortly after in the Groove PS2 launch party.

56:47.368 --> 56:48.589
[SPEAKER_00]: And I walked out of that

56:48.769 --> 56:49.590
[SPEAKER_00]: I still play rock band like crazy.

56:49.610 --> 56:49.730
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um...

57:08.826 --> 57:27.301
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it was a great thing, but I think once Activision took a hold of it and then started kind of milking the franchise for everything it was worth, leading to the eventual downfall of the whole band-based music game altogether, I think that that was really kind of where they missed their mark and handled it like they didn't handle it right at all.

57:27.521 --> 57:53.885
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think initially it was a great idea and it's not really like Konami was robbed of it I mean they knew the game was coming out and they made the conscious effort not to release it a lot of people don't remember this either but back in 2000 Guitar Freaks was slated for release in the US I still have a receipt some here and all my random music game collectibles for a pre-order that I placed at FYE in Cleveland, Ohio back in like I want to say March of 2000 for that game and then it got cancelled like last minute

57:54.264 --> 58:06.367
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I remember playing the arcade version all the time, the US releases, you know, and what was it that someone was telling me, like, when I was still playing it, oh yeah, I've got my pre-order in, you know, just basically what you were saying.

58:07.288 --> 58:17.591
[SPEAKER_10]: But I remember when we got contacted for them to do something for the local news for Guitar Hero at my house, and they made me hide my Guitar Freaks stuff.

58:17.791 --> 58:18.331
Yeah.

58:19.111 --> 58:44.194
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's more of like a lawsuit issue than anything else I mean you know Activision did kind of go or not Activision but Red Octane went around that whole issue the right way and that they worked with Konami to get the licensing cleared for the release on that unlike you know some previous music games have been done so that's kind of weird to hear but no I don't think Konami was really robbed of anything I think that you know that was their fault for not releasing the game when they had the opportunity and really grabbing hold of that market early on

58:44.787 --> 58:45.207
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.

58:45.268 --> 58:51.693
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially if Red Octane was working with Konami over the licensing, then they had their eyes open the whole time.

58:52.233 --> 58:52.594
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.

58:52.674 --> 58:55.036
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why Konami ended up producing the arcade cabinet.

58:55.116 --> 59:04.564
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of the licensing agreement that they had for that game was that Konami would take over the rights to produce and build the arcade cabinets for that title.

59:05.144 --> 59:08.185
[SPEAKER_13]: Max Ninja in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com agrees with you.

59:08.205 --> 59:11.546
[SPEAKER_13]: Guitar Heroes 1, 2, and 3 are the best Guitar Hero games after that.

59:12.006 --> 59:13.447
[SPEAKER_13]: It just sucked.

59:13.487 --> 59:15.767
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't even really say Guitar Hero 3 was that great.

59:15.808 --> 59:17.068
[SPEAKER_00]: That was still never soft.

59:17.448 --> 59:23.870
[SPEAKER_00]: It was better than any of their other offerings, but I still wouldn't say that it was like the top tier of the franchise.

59:24.190 --> 59:27.571
[SPEAKER_13]: It was definitely the cliff-teetering game where it's like, oh, here we go.

59:27.611 --> 59:28.271
[SPEAKER_13]: We're on our way down.

59:28.752 --> 59:29.472
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, pretty much.

59:30.012 --> 59:40.903
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to say, I wonder what part of the agreement between Activision and Konami that they decided that they're going to put out a really terrible music game called Rock Revolution and then help the sales of guitar heroes with that.

59:41.023 --> 59:49.612
[SPEAKER_00]: The stories I could tell you that I've heard about that one, because I know guys that worked on that on both sides in America and Japan, and the guys in America were like...

59:50.172 --> 59:50.693
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Ranma S,

01:00:09.787 --> 01:00:10.447
[SPEAKER_00]: Drum Controller.

01:00:10.507 --> 01:00:12.368
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better than the Rock Band Drum Controller.

01:00:12.468 --> 01:00:13.228
[SPEAKER_00]: It was awesome.

01:00:13.668 --> 01:00:15.589
[SPEAKER_00]: But they produced so few of them.

01:00:15.629 --> 01:00:17.209
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody really got a chance to get a hold of those.

01:00:17.589 --> 01:00:31.814
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the stories that I had heard about that game was that the guy who started that whole project in Japan was actually doing it as a quote-unquote revenge project against the companies in America that had put out these rock games.

01:00:32.554 --> 01:00:35.755
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't really know what his meaning of revenge was.

01:00:36.155 --> 01:00:38.796
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it to release a really bad game and punish the fans?

01:00:38.876 --> 01:00:39.516
[SPEAKER_00]: Or was it like

01:00:40.513 --> 01:00:42.894
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to put something out that would take all the sales.

01:00:43.094 --> 01:00:49.918
[SPEAKER_13]: That sounds like Wile E. Coyote kind of revenge, where he builds the elaborate trap only to have it blow up in his face.

01:00:50.678 --> 01:00:51.238
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty much.

01:00:53.199 --> 01:00:58.582
[SPEAKER_13]: We obviously would not be able to get through an interview with you without talking at least a little bit about DJ Max.

01:00:59.142 --> 01:01:05.045
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have to admit, I have loved music games for a very long time.

01:01:05.125 --> 01:01:09.567
[SPEAKER_13]: When OLR went through its creative shift a few years ago, we kind of opened ourselves up to the different types of games.

01:01:10.027 --> 01:01:15.888
[SPEAKER_13]: I have not been following the DJ Max news as rabidly as I was the earlier Konami series.

01:01:15.948 --> 01:01:21.029
[SPEAKER_13]: Although, when I saw the Technica machine in the arcade, I thought it was a good time.

01:01:21.369 --> 01:01:25.230
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know there's a lot of stuff that they've been trying to do with the Vita and so forth.

01:01:25.850 --> 01:01:36.532
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you think, maybe an old school music game fan like me, who's kind of turned away from that scene a little bit, what do you think maybe I should be looking at in DJ Max?

01:01:36.592 --> 01:01:39.112
[SPEAKER_13]: Why should I maybe come back and give DJ Max a look?

01:01:39.497 --> 01:01:52.963
[SPEAKER_00]: well it depends on which one you're going to play if you're going to play Technica then that's kind of like a whole different can of worms than if you're going to play the portable games which obviously would take a little bit of importing and dusting off your PSP I think with

01:01:53.257 --> 01:02:10.343
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Maxx is a franchise, and I know there are people out there that know that I work for Pentavision, so I don't want anyone to think that this is like a company shill kind of thing here, but my attraction to the DJ Maxx franchise is kind of the same attraction that I have to Konami's Bimani games, and that's the music that they use in the game is...

01:02:11.683 --> 01:02:18.845
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of original producers producing stuff under different genres, and there's a lot of variety to the music in and of itself.

01:02:19.685 --> 01:02:25.066
[SPEAKER_00]: My attraction to music games personally has a lot less to do with the gameplay and a lot more to do with the music that they use.

01:02:25.526 --> 01:02:33.608
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of where I think the strong point of the DJ Maxx franchise is that they really have a very, very diverse song list across all of the games.

01:02:33.928 --> 01:02:35.449
[SPEAKER_00]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:02:56.585 --> 01:03:00.407
[SPEAKER_00]: Hard rock music, punk rock music, hardcore, classic.

01:03:01.508 --> 01:03:02.969
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really where it shines for me.

01:03:03.529 --> 01:03:08.092
[SPEAKER_00]: The gameplay in Technica, if you're speaking of that specifically, it's different.

01:03:09.273 --> 01:03:17.958
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot to it that's similar to the other games, but the whole touchscreen interface and the way that the interface of the game itself functions is different.

01:03:17.978 --> 01:03:20.139
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of fresh at the time that it came out.

01:03:20.219 --> 01:03:22.581
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, it's been four years since then, but

01:03:23.501 --> 01:03:39.746
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very fresh compared to a lot of other music game interfaces out there and it's not too hard to pick up and just the way that you interact with the game is very fun so I would say if you're a fan of the music that's what you should be looking forward to the most because there's just a ton of really fantastic music in those games

01:03:40.063 --> 01:03:40.243
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

01:03:40.283 --> 01:03:44.385
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we've had Eddie on like way longer than we said we were going to have him on.

01:03:44.445 --> 01:03:47.646
[SPEAKER_13]: But if he's down with it, I want to get a few questions from the chat room out.

01:03:47.746 --> 01:03:50.827
[SPEAKER_13]: So live.vognetwork.com is the place to ask your questions.

01:03:51.207 --> 01:03:55.029
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me ask this one that was asked earlier from Das Bacon who asked –

01:03:56.149 --> 01:04:01.094
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to say beforehand, by the way, he's my roommate and he works on the website.

01:04:01.114 --> 01:04:03.436
[SPEAKER_00]: So his question is kind of like a moot point.

01:04:03.777 --> 01:04:04.918
[SPEAKER_00]: Loaded question.

01:04:04.978 --> 01:04:05.298
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

01:04:05.779 --> 01:04:08.742
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll ask it anyway since I didn't know that and I thought it was a good question.

01:04:09.082 --> 01:04:10.424
[SPEAKER_13]: What is the future of Bomani Style?

01:04:12.005 --> 01:04:15.589
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, can I kind of keep pushing forward really?

01:04:15.629 --> 01:04:19.132
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean we had a huge server outage earlier in the year and –

01:04:20.768 --> 01:04:22.851
[SPEAKER_00]: It caused us to lose all the original data.

01:04:23.672 --> 01:04:24.553
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still out there.

01:04:24.613 --> 01:04:32.063
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like the original hard drives died or anything like that, but we don't have access to the server the site used to be hosted on due to a complication with our old host.

01:04:32.644 --> 01:04:34.427
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a good...

01:04:36.871 --> 01:05:04.112
[SPEAKER_00]: 6 months or so where I just kind of gave up on everything and nothing was getting done but just recently I've got that bug again and I've got a few people helping us out and we're going to just kind of push forward and getting the most recent version that we had been developing for like the past 2 years finished and online with the resources that we have available and people will start seeing that soon with the headline section rolling out we've got a new machine location database on deck

01:05:05.553 --> 01:05:08.940
[SPEAKER_00]: ScoreTrackers for just about every single game out there.

01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:12.406
[SPEAKER_00]: Even ridiculous stuff like Poppin' Stage will have a ScoreTracker on the website.

01:05:13.658 --> 01:05:31.044
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do a greatly expanded sim file database because that was one of the most popular things we had on the site with new sorting options and a lot better ways to promote your files than what we had before because there was a lot of really good stuff that would just get hidden amongst a sea of crap.

01:05:32.585 --> 01:05:35.366
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the things we definitely want to change this time around once we get that going.

01:05:36.109 --> 01:05:39.856
[SPEAKER_13]: Legend of Zaku wants to know, is the Bomani Land Ranch still open?

01:05:41.138 --> 01:05:43.703
[SPEAKER_00]: We moved from the Bomani Land Ranch.

01:05:43.823 --> 01:05:46.007
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we live in what we call the Bomani Land Resort.

01:05:47.637 --> 01:05:48.858
[SPEAKER_13]: Second Style.

01:05:49.538 --> 01:05:53.861
[SPEAKER_00]: The old house was a ranch house in Anaheim, California, and it was just a really big place.

01:05:53.881 --> 01:05:55.762
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had like 30 arcade cabinets there.

01:05:56.322 --> 01:06:00.605
[SPEAKER_00]: And the new house, it's not as open to the public as it used to be just because of space.

01:06:00.705 --> 01:06:05.027
[SPEAKER_00]: We sold off some of the machines, but we still have all of the key machines.

01:06:05.067 --> 01:06:06.008
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep them updated.

01:06:06.288 --> 01:06:10.711
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we have a pool and a hot tub and a koi pond and a nice atrium.

01:06:10.751 --> 01:06:11.151
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a

01:06:11.771 --> 01:06:13.311
[SPEAKER_00]: Really kind of a relaxed place to hang out.

01:06:13.352 --> 01:06:14.572
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's still open.

01:06:15.572 --> 01:06:21.494
[SPEAKER_00]: If you contact me via email or Facebook or whatever, if you're going to be in town, we can arrange to have you come over and hang out.

01:06:21.694 --> 01:06:24.074
[SPEAKER_13]: Heck yeah, we come to Disneyland down there all the time.

01:06:24.114 --> 01:06:25.715
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to come storm the place.

01:06:27.315 --> 01:06:29.476
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys come down here and not hang out at my house.

01:06:31.627 --> 01:06:31.988
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see.

01:06:33.729 --> 01:06:35.230
[SPEAKER_13]: Shane Alinko is asking a question.

01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:40.894
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this is tongue-in-cheek, but I'll ask it anyway because a lot of people always kind of want to know, how do I break into the industry?

01:06:41.835 --> 01:06:43.356
[SPEAKER_13]: How can I get hired at Pentavision?

01:06:43.376 --> 01:06:45.518
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't even know if this is one you can answer.

01:06:45.898 --> 01:06:47.399
[SPEAKER_00]: I honestly don't even know, man.

01:06:47.439 --> 01:06:48.600
[SPEAKER_00]: I got hired on accident.

01:06:50.130 --> 01:06:56.635
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly speaking, I got brought in with a bunch of friends of mine to consult for Technica 2 when it first came out.

01:06:56.655 --> 01:07:01.799
[SPEAKER_00]: We were helping them with the Technica 2.5 project that never actually ended up happening.

01:07:02.379 --> 01:07:04.121
[SPEAKER_00]: In one of the meetings, they

01:07:04.935 --> 01:07:05.756
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on.

01:07:25.034 --> 01:07:25.354
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.

01:07:26.335 --> 01:07:28.116
[SPEAKER_13]: So you just got to beg and ask a lot.

01:07:43.064 --> 01:08:09.254
[SPEAKER_00]: they're really in tune with the fans they like listening to input a lot and they they really feel bad when they do something that ends up disappointing people and uh so really it's just a matter of like i'm sure whenever we end up hiring which isn't really something we have on deck right now but whenever we end up hiring i'm sure you know the the doors will be open to members of the community who are passionate enough that have the skills to want to work with us so just i guess keep an eye out on the pentavision uh global website and

01:08:10.135 --> 01:08:13.078
[SPEAKER_00]: If we ever throw up any job postings, give us a contact.

01:08:14.159 --> 01:08:15.299
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me ask this question from somebody.

01:08:15.319 --> 01:08:18.882
[SPEAKER_13]: They didn't change their nickname, so I'll just call them 693 because that's the number they got.

01:08:19.483 --> 01:08:20.484
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you think is the future?

01:08:20.544 --> 01:08:22.085
[SPEAKER_13]: We've actually got this from a couple people in chat.

01:08:22.165 --> 01:08:25.268
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you think is the future of console rhythm music games?

01:08:25.748 --> 01:08:31.393
[SPEAKER_13]: And he follows up and says specifically Bomani CS games, but I'm kind of interested in the general sense.

01:08:31.473 --> 01:08:34.015
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you think is the future of console music games?

01:08:35.495 --> 01:08:39.298
[SPEAKER_00]: In North America, I really couldn't even give you an honest answer.

01:08:39.358 --> 01:08:45.702
[SPEAKER_00]: The market in the US has just proven itself to not be there, especially as of late.

01:08:46.002 --> 01:08:49.104
[SPEAKER_00]: Harmonix has a good thing going with the Rock Band 3 setup.

01:08:49.344 --> 01:08:55.428
[SPEAKER_00]: The game doesn't need anything else added to it, so just cranking out new songs is perfect for their existing user base.

01:08:55.949 --> 01:08:56.329
[SPEAKER_00]: Dance Central...

01:09:01.079 --> 01:09:29.968
[SPEAKER_00]: Dance Central and Just Dance and stuff, those will probably continue to be yearly games just because of the necessity of releasing them on a disc there's a lot of data that goes into the moves and choreographing the characters and stuff so I'm sure those will continue to be on disc but as far as hardcore music games I can't be 100% certain of this and I know I'm going to break wide open some news here but Konami didn't show DDR at E3 this year and when I

01:09:30.416 --> 01:09:31.077
[SPEAKER_00]: and DarkSakura.com.

01:09:54.637 --> 01:10:10.242
[SPEAKER_05]: Something that appeals to arcade fans, something that appeals to fans of Just Dance Up, and then also on top of that, have some sort of, I had envisioned this kind of revolution, adventure, kind of taking their adventure mode, but way beyond where they had it.

01:10:10.322 --> 01:10:11.182
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, let the man finish.

01:10:11.202 --> 01:10:12.303
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to hear E3 gossip.

01:10:36.549 --> 01:10:54.070
[SPEAKER_00]: and um it's speculative on my behalf but I would not be surprised if that had something to do with the delay in the game this year because he was the one that was heading up that entire project so um I know since then things have been handed off to uh U1 who's heading up DDR 2013 in the arcades but um

01:10:55.051 --> 01:10:57.292
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, as far as the US goes, I really couldn't say.

01:10:57.512 --> 01:10:58.852
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too hard to tell.

01:10:59.192 --> 01:11:12.937
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, PentaVision, we're releasing DJ Max Technica tunes soon, but realistically, we're just not sure how it's going to sell because the Vita is not a very widely performing platform right now.

01:11:13.557 --> 01:11:13.697
[SPEAKER_00]: And

01:11:15.178 --> 01:11:23.433
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been really hard to market that game as a result of some of the contracts we have in place with our worldwide partners, so the word hasn't gotten out about that title enough.

01:11:23.834 --> 01:11:27.240
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of Japanese music games, I don't...

01:11:28.297 --> 01:11:34.199
[SPEAKER_00]: My honest opinion is I don't think they really need to do console versions for them anymore, because they have the arcades.

01:11:34.839 --> 01:11:44.203
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that when you do a console version of a game that is primarily an arcade game, like it is over there, you're just taking activity away from the arcades at that point.

01:11:44.403 --> 01:11:52.166
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not to say that I don't think Konami will ever do another console music game, because obviously they're doing U-Beat and Reflect Beat on the iPad, but

01:11:52.526 --> 01:11:54.827
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that they really need to do the console games.

01:11:54.887 --> 01:12:08.615
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that a lot of North American fans hate me for saying that, and it definitely feels like they're owed those console games, but that's not the way the market works in Japan, and since the games are primarily Japanese, I think that's just kind of the state of where they're at.

01:12:09.326 --> 01:12:12.248
[SPEAKER_05]: Without the console version of DDR, how will I make my edit data?

01:12:14.989 --> 01:12:21.713
[SPEAKER_00]: See, they made that really crappy Flash utility for DDRX in the US and a whole five people used it.

01:12:23.535 --> 01:12:24.795
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's ways around it.

01:12:24.835 --> 01:12:25.996
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like people aren't clever.

01:12:26.116 --> 01:12:32.640
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a guy out there that wrote a utility to let you create edits in Stepmania and then export them as data that you could use in the arcade cabinets.

01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:33.661
[SPEAKER_00]: People are

01:12:34.571 --> 01:12:37.314
[SPEAKER_00]: People in the Bumani community are way too clever for their own good sometimes.

01:12:37.614 --> 01:12:39.176
[SPEAKER_10]: See, I know what the solution to everything is.

01:12:39.937 --> 01:12:40.557
[SPEAKER_10]: New Parapara.

01:12:42.279 --> 01:12:44.441
[SPEAKER_00]: Dance Masters is, though.

01:12:45.142 --> 01:12:47.124
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually like Dance Masters because of the Parapara.

01:12:47.677 --> 01:12:50.178
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Dance Evolution came out as an arcade cabinet in Japan.

01:12:50.238 --> 01:12:55.181
[SPEAKER_00]: And apparently, it's one of those games that's not talked about widely, but they get regular updates with new songs.

01:12:56.182 --> 01:12:58.543
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's still kind of doing well, I guess.

01:12:58.583 --> 01:13:05.067
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was one of the questions that I asked Naoki when we talked at E3 a few years ago when Dance Masters had been first released.

01:13:05.467 --> 01:13:07.988
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I noticed that Night of Fire is in this game.

01:13:08.649 --> 01:13:11.070
[SPEAKER_00]: And you used the original routine for it.

01:13:12.851 --> 01:13:14.512
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this influenced by Parapara at all?

01:13:14.532 --> 01:13:15.173
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, no.

01:13:15.633 --> 01:13:17.554
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I worked on Parapara, but it's not the same game.

01:13:17.574 --> 01:13:18.915
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's Parapara.

01:13:18.995 --> 01:13:20.496
[SPEAKER_00]: It's essentially like the Kinect version.

01:13:20.716 --> 01:13:25.479
[SPEAKER_10]: Especially since they opened the old location of Valfar up as Nikufar.

01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:27.381
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the Parapara scene's coming back.

01:13:28.061 --> 01:13:29.742
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, they never really died.

01:13:29.802 --> 01:13:32.724
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kind of like shrunk and now it's expanding again.

01:13:32.824 --> 01:13:37.027
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's just one of those things, I guess, maybe when it gets big enough...

01:13:38.035 --> 01:13:39.696
[SPEAKER_00]: to make them make notice again.

01:13:39.896 --> 01:13:42.918
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got a type of music that it latches onto once again.

01:13:42.938 --> 01:13:47.520
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think, I don't know if the hyper, or was it hyper techno stuff?

01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:50.022
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's still really as relevant as it was a few years ago.

01:13:50.102 --> 01:13:57.866
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think if they latch onto a new style of music and it becomes popular in the mainstream of Japan again, you could possibly see another Parapara game get released.

01:13:58.675 --> 01:13:59.636
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been playing a little bit of...

01:14:24.159 --> 01:14:25.080
[SPEAKER_00]: New Super Mario Bros.

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:29.723
[SPEAKER_00]: 2, although I haven't been able to get into it as much as the original one for the DS.

01:14:30.904 --> 01:14:40.010
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, and I feel kind of weird saying it, but I've been really addicted to the Adventure Time Turbo Jumping Fin game on iOS lately.

01:14:40.830 --> 01:14:43.392
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such an easy pick-up-and-play.

01:14:43.472 --> 01:14:46.574
[SPEAKER_00]: I could play it for two minutes anywhere, and then I'm all over that.

01:14:46.594 --> 01:14:47.735
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Adventure Time.

01:14:47.775 --> 01:14:50.797
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm obsessed with it, and I can't wait for the game coming out later this month.

01:14:51.938 --> 01:14:52.618
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that,

01:14:55.200 --> 01:15:19.695
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to start playing Halo 4 soon and I'm planning to pick up Super Paper Mario Sticker Star later on this week nice well Eddie before we let you go I want to get the plugs out there for your stuff if you don't already know about this website and you're into music game fans or if you're into music games I'm not sure how that's possible but BamaniStyle.com is the place to get all the latest and greatest on what's going on in the music game scene especially overseas and so forth right?

01:15:21.521 --> 01:15:25.543
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to be egotistical about it.

01:15:25.563 --> 01:15:37.008
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other resources out there that have been doing a better job than us lately, but we try our best and we have a lot of friends in the industry, so we come up with some pretty interesting stuff from time to time, so I'd say we're worth checking out.

01:15:37.328 --> 01:15:37.608

01:15:37.808 --> 01:15:39.909

[SPEAKER_00]: working the shoe department of Nordstrom's in Northern California recently.

01:16:34.019 --> 01:16:41.242
[SPEAKER_00]: He was spotted not too long ago, and I really wanted to run into the department store and ask him that question, but he wasn't working the day that I was in town.

01:16:42.918 --> 01:16:43.299

[SPEAKER_13]: But we do want to keep moving on with the show.

01:18:42.174 --> 01:18:43.996
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's move on with some news.

01:18:44.536 --> 01:18:45.837
[SPEAKER_13]: Finally, Loki.

01:18:46.017 --> 01:18:46.717
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, that's all right.

01:18:46.778 --> 01:18:48.539
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a great, great show so far tonight.

01:18:48.819 --> 01:18:49.700
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely fantastic.

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:55.764
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about the Wii U because we're very close to the Wii U launch, one week from today.

01:18:56.584 --> 01:19:04.247
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, there's still some of that stuff out there that we don't yet know, but mainly kind of tied with the whole network stuff.

01:19:04.287 --> 01:19:07.448
[SPEAKER_05]: So first off, what is Nintendo Network ID?

01:19:07.928 --> 01:19:20.292
[SPEAKER_05]: And they actually have this whole kind of either Nintendo Direct press conference, or not even press conference, like consumer conferencing, stream, web video, whatever you want to call it.

01:19:20.732 --> 01:19:22.574
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, so they talked a little bit about it.

01:19:22.634 --> 01:19:26.857
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically what it is is that the friend code system has kind of been, it's gone away.

01:19:27.097 --> 01:19:29.819
[SPEAKER_05]: And now it's being replaced by this Nintendo Network ID.

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:37.985
[SPEAKER_05]: And what the ID is going to be used for is basically like the 3DS, they say smartphones and PCs.

01:19:39.306 --> 01:19:47.673
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, of course, the Wii U. And it's going to be basically tied so that you have all your software logged into one thing.

01:19:49.531 --> 01:20:15.197
[SPEAKER_05]: in layman's terms it's basically going to be an account name so like you know you have an Xbox Live or Playstation Network you have an account that all that stuff's tied to you're going to have an account that's going to be a name and tie it to that and you can make your friends and do all that stuff so fantastic getting with the 21st century and getting rid of stupid friend codes welcome to the big kids table Nintendo yay mommy wow

01:20:15.857 --> 01:20:33.080
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, so it says basically users can exchange the number, whatever this number is, or I guess just like a friend's code, but then also they'll also be able to register friends, I guess they meet with Miiverse.

01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:53.815
[SPEAKER_05]: so there may be a number still tied to your account however I think they're going to have a name to that as well or it's going to be just one number that you're going to have for all future Nintendo consoles or whatever so there's that and of course that sounds a lot like the Battle.net battle tags just so you know like where you have like the name and then the random numbers at the end yeah

01:20:54.455 --> 01:21:00.699
[SPEAKER_05]: So then also, of course, they've got the Wii U chat stuff, and they said that, of course, you're going to be able to talk to each other using chat.

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:07.204
[SPEAKER_05]: They say that, I guess, users will be able to draw images on the chat window while they talk.

01:21:08.264 --> 01:21:11.627
[SPEAKER_13]: And instant hilarity, just add cocks.

01:21:13.508 --> 01:21:14.909
[SPEAKER_13]: Because you know that's what's going to happen.

01:21:15.189 --> 01:21:16.930
[SPEAKER_13]: What else are people going to draw on the screens?

01:21:17.971 --> 01:21:23.975
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, I'm going to have a video chat with Loki, and I'm going to draw a big dick right next to his head, and it'll be hilarious.

01:21:25.515 --> 01:21:27.737
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that photo I took at Fry's spells it out.

01:21:29.218 --> 01:21:29.919
[SPEAKER_13]: Which one is this?

01:21:30.159 --> 01:21:33.041
[SPEAKER_10]: The one where I walked by the monitor and there was a big dick on it that someone drew.

01:21:33.882 --> 01:21:34.362
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course.

01:21:36.223 --> 01:21:37.765
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, they have that stuff.

01:21:37.845 --> 01:21:49.174
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, they're saying that I guess people can place calls to each other through the Wii U chat and there's going to be a light on the gamepad that'll blink to indicate that there's an incoming call or something like that.

01:21:49.654 --> 01:21:54.037
[SPEAKER_05]: It just sounds like it's very basic stuff that they're just describing in a very complex way that...

01:21:54.938 --> 01:21:55.158
[SPEAKER_05]: Wara Wara?

01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:20.300
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:22.041
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's going to change for the US.

01:22:22.481 --> 01:22:29.183
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's... Well, actually, apparently the English name will be the Wariwara Plaza.

01:22:30.923 --> 01:22:31.563
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm fine with that.

01:22:32.304 --> 01:22:34.724
[SPEAKER_13]: Which... The distant cousin of Woohoo Island.

01:22:35.044 --> 01:22:36.965
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, why can't it be Mi Plaza?

01:22:37.345 --> 01:22:39.166
[SPEAKER_05]: Or the Wii U Plaza?

01:22:39.406 --> 01:22:41.726
[SPEAKER_05]: Or the home screen?

01:22:42.027 --> 01:22:42.947
[SPEAKER_05]: Or something like that?

01:22:43.387 --> 01:22:45.428
[SPEAKER_05]: Why does it have to be something ridiculous?

01:22:45.668 --> 01:22:46.868
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it should be Mi Goosta.

01:22:49.465 --> 01:23:02.658
[SPEAKER_05]: but anyways yeah so it looks like you know basically your meat plaza that you had had on the Wii except now there's you know titles that you may have played in the Wii U games and stuff like that that they're huddling around which

01:23:04.435 --> 01:23:07.497
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:23:26.932 --> 01:23:29.333
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you may have a connection at work or something like that.

01:23:29.393 --> 01:23:30.113
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying.

01:23:31.113 --> 01:23:33.054
[SPEAKER_05]: You may not have a connection to the internet at home.

01:23:33.334 --> 01:23:34.094
[SPEAKER_05]: You got me there.

01:23:34.395 --> 01:23:36.675
[SPEAKER_05]: Or your console may not be in an area.

01:23:37.296 --> 01:23:41.537
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you're in the Dark Ages and you don't have a Wi-Fi router or something like that.

01:23:41.717 --> 01:23:45.358
[SPEAKER_05]: Or it just doesn't work through your walls or whatever.

01:23:45.558 --> 01:23:46.959
[SPEAKER_05]: You may have connectivity issues.

01:23:47.879 --> 01:23:51.764
[SPEAKER_05]: Either way, so you're going to have to download this as a day one download.

01:23:52.284 --> 01:23:55.187
[SPEAKER_05]: This and I believe the internet browser are going to be part of that.

01:23:59.773 --> 01:24:00.314
[SPEAKER_13]: V-Board V-Board

01:24:27.274 --> 01:24:28.795
[SPEAKER_13]: and asked them some questions.

01:24:28.835 --> 01:24:30.835
[SPEAKER_13]: And of course, there's YouTubes of it all over the internet.

01:24:31.535 --> 01:24:35.477
[SPEAKER_13]: Newell did say no Half-Life 3 questions, so that wasn't out there.

01:24:35.537 --> 01:24:40.678
[SPEAKER_13]: But that doesn't mean they couldn't get some other questions, such as, is Valve working on a new Source engine?

01:24:41.098 --> 01:24:44.339
[SPEAKER_13]: And Newell said, we've been working on a new engine stuff for a while.

01:24:45.119 --> 01:24:50.341
[SPEAKER_13]: There was some garbled audio with subtitles that say, we've just been waiting for a game to roll it out with.

01:24:51.501 --> 01:24:55.904
[SPEAKER_13]: And there was another question asked saying, is it more than just an extension to Source?

01:24:55.964 --> 01:24:57.925
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, is it an entirely new engine?

01:24:58.325 --> 01:25:00.246
[SPEAKER_13]: And Gabe Newell said, yeah.

01:25:01.027 --> 01:25:05.569
[SPEAKER_13]: So apparently the rumor mill is still pumping out there on Source 2.

01:25:05.649 --> 01:25:08.191
[SPEAKER_13]: This is after the uncovered code in August.

01:25:08.331 --> 01:25:08.611
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

01:25:36.867 --> 01:26:03.316
[SPEAKER_10]: oh square oh square we need sad music we need we need a dirge we need sad music I don't yeah what about Aerith dying music all right all right we can do we can do all right I'll get some sad music but that's happy music for me Eric living or dead Earth living music I don't know yeah well Aerith dying music was happy for me because I hated her

01:26:03.928 --> 01:26:07.371
[SPEAKER_05]: Just be the sound of the sword winning through her over and over.

01:26:08.792 --> 01:26:12.675
[SPEAKER_05]: Ten hours of sword... That's better.

01:26:14.933 --> 01:26:18.396
[SPEAKER_10]: So, Final Fantasy XIV has come to an end.

01:26:18.936 --> 01:26:20.617
[SPEAKER_10]: Dun, dun, dun.

01:26:21.518 --> 01:26:28.983
[SPEAKER_10]: And, yeah, instead of some of the stuff that people were promised, what they had was basically server farting.

01:26:29.724 --> 01:26:31.165
[SPEAKER_10]: They got a really nice cinematic.

01:26:33.566 --> 01:26:34.887
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay, it's happy music.

01:26:34.927 --> 01:26:37.669
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just imagining the actual literal server farting.

01:26:37.890 --> 01:26:39.311
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, this is the end.

01:26:39.351 --> 01:26:39.531
[SPEAKER_05]: Boom.

01:26:44.261 --> 01:26:47.524
[SPEAKER_13]: You shouldn't be making fart noises over this very sad song.

01:26:48.045 --> 01:26:49.326
[SPEAKER_13]: This is happy music.

01:26:52.490 --> 01:26:54.051
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember, vote for us at the podcast awards.

01:26:59.317 --> 01:27:00.598
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay, she's dead.

01:27:00.858 --> 01:27:01.339
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

01:27:02.059 --> 01:27:02.960
[SPEAKER_10]: My favorite part.

01:27:03.881 --> 01:27:05.283
[SPEAKER_10]: My save file still works, Rob, by the way.

01:27:07.283 --> 01:27:11.864
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, people were basically logging on you.

01:27:11.965 --> 01:27:16.326
[SPEAKER_10]: Those few loyal, deluded people who were still into the game.

01:27:16.366 --> 01:27:18.807
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, I have friends that were still playing Final Fantasy XIV.

01:27:19.247 --> 01:27:19.867
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, deluded.

01:27:19.927 --> 01:27:20.907
[SPEAKER_13]: You like what you like.

01:27:22.108 --> 01:27:27.229
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't make fun of anybody this week because I've popped so many squares on that Curiosity Cube.

01:27:27.389 --> 01:27:28.429
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't judge anybody.

01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:28.730
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

01:27:28.750 --> 01:27:29.870
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

01:27:29.970 --> 01:27:32.431
[SPEAKER_10]: What was the line from Monty Python?

01:27:32.971 --> 01:27:34.411
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't know much about art, but I know what I like.

01:27:35.832 --> 01:27:36.012
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

01:27:37.292 --> 01:27:42.095
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um... I'm just going to read the quote from here from one of the players.

01:27:42.455 --> 01:27:50.780
[SPEAKER_10]: There were so many waiting to log in and fight in the promised epic battles that Square Enix had to start turning players away based on subscription end date.

01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:56.863
[SPEAKER_10]: So those who were in had bad lag, especially in menus, and couldn't form parties.

01:27:57.704 --> 01:28:04.667
[SPEAKER_10]: And when they actually did get to fight some of these epic monsters they were promised, they were...

01:28:06.930 --> 01:28:20.688
[SPEAKER_10]: and it was like these level 100 monsters that were only ever seen in cutscenes they really couldn't get much about it and so basically the last server message just pretty much bleeped over and over again confound contact with main host

01:28:23.482 --> 01:28:24.082
[SPEAKER_13]: What a way to go.

01:28:24.383 --> 01:28:28.025
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but there's a pretty nice cinematic up on Kotaku, so go watch that.

01:28:28.366 --> 01:28:30.507
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the only good thing to ever come out of Final Fantasy XIV.

01:28:30.647 --> 01:28:33.009
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, by pretty nice, you mean pretty fucking amazing.

01:28:33.389 --> 01:28:35.551
[SPEAKER_13]: If you do watch cinematic, it's pretty epic.

01:28:37.112 --> 01:28:39.193
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm very curious about this Realm Reborn.

01:28:39.253 --> 01:28:47.439
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I can't believe they went so far as to just pull the fucking plug on XIV as it was and saying, all right, hold up, you guys.

01:28:47.539 --> 01:28:48.120
[SPEAKER_13]: We got this.

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:50.442
[SPEAKER_13]: Just give us about six months to get it up and running again.

01:28:50.462 --> 01:28:52.163
[SPEAKER_13]: It's crazy, so...

01:28:52.572 --> 01:28:57.335
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we'll just do a real update this time instead of just like poo-pooing out something.

01:28:58.596 --> 01:28:59.677
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, well we'll see what happens.

01:28:59.757 --> 01:29:02.779
[SPEAKER_13]: If it was worth the wait or if it is poo-poo.

01:29:03.359 --> 01:29:06.822
[SPEAKER_13]: In the meantime, something a little closer to look forward to.

01:29:06.882 --> 01:29:08.063
[SPEAKER_13]: This week's release dates.

01:29:08.803 --> 01:29:09.404
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh my god.

01:29:09.544 --> 01:29:12.086
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a little bit happening in the States this week, isn't there, Loki?

01:29:13.227 --> 01:29:20.574
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a tad bit, considering that we've got the Wii U launch, so there's every goddamn game coming out on the Wii U all at one time.

01:29:20.734 --> 01:29:22.196
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about the big stuff first.

01:29:22.236 --> 01:29:23.177
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, obviously...

01:29:23.977 --> 01:29:30.461
[SPEAKER_05]: The biggest game of the year, and this is probably by sales, this is not necessarily on popularity, but it is pretty popular as well.

[SPEAKER_13]: And YYR mentions it a little earlier in chat with, what did he say?

01:35:50.614 --> 01:35:52.136
[SPEAKER_13]: They're really going to have to start over.

01:35:52.236 --> 01:35:54.998
[SPEAKER_13]: Shouldn't they have wanted to at least retain the small audience they had?

01:35:56.419 --> 01:35:58.240
[SPEAKER_13]: They are hoping they'll come back.

01:35:58.521 --> 01:36:03.144
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think the ones that were loyal to 14 until the very end, I think they will come back.

01:36:03.565 --> 01:36:06.887
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, for them to have held out on that game that long, they'll come back.

01:36:07.288 --> 01:36:09.770
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's my prediction for the whole thing.

01:36:10.410 --> 01:36:11.071
[SPEAKER_10]: Wah, wah.

01:36:11.371 --> 01:36:13.153
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll come back when they make 11, free to play.

01:36:13.473 --> 01:36:15.535
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll withhold judgment until I see it.

01:36:16.576 --> 01:36:21.040
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, if 14, the real one, which is really what this is now.

[SPEAKER_10]: Change the firewood.

01:37:53.426 --> 01:37:55.247
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a game to teach you how to clean your house.

01:37:55.287 --> 01:37:56.008
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be hilarious.

01:37:56.940 --> 01:37:57.180
[SPEAKER_13]: on the 3DS.

01:38:15.829 --> 01:38:19.912
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, I'm looking at this and I don't think this is like Cinderella like the fairy tale.

01:38:19.932 --> 01:38:21.092
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course not.

01:38:21.233 --> 01:38:26.636
[SPEAKER_13]: This girl dressed up in the little Playboy bunny outfit and pink skirt, that's not what I think of when I think of Cinderella.

01:38:26.936 --> 01:38:29.378
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like overtly shoujo manga style.

01:38:29.698 --> 01:38:32.840
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so I don't think like Disney Cinderella.

01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:35.442
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm thinking it's a little something else.

01:38:35.462 --> 01:38:36.702
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't the lesson still the same?

01:38:39.744 --> 01:38:42.126
[SPEAKER_10]: Cinderella's lesson was if you want that man, you go get him.

01:38:44.110 --> 01:38:49.048
[SPEAKER_05]: And you take lots of drugs, so you think that you're being met by fairy godmothers.

01:38:49.068 --> 01:38:50.372
[SPEAKER_12]: Jamie Reed released dates for the UK.

01:38:51.580 --> 01:38:52.221
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess.

01:38:53.221 --> 01:38:53.602
[SPEAKER_10]: Rab.

01:38:55.043 --> 01:39:00.127
[SPEAKER_10]: On the 13th, we have Call of Duty Black Ops 2, Rift Storm Legion for PC.

01:39:00.707 --> 01:39:03.650
[SPEAKER_10]: On the 14th, we have Wonder Book, one book, a thousand stories.

01:39:04.290 --> 01:39:06.212
[SPEAKER_10]: And El Cubo, whatever that is.

01:39:07.393 --> 01:39:08.834
[SPEAKER_10]: And let's see, when is the weekend?

01:39:08.934 --> 01:39:14.058
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, on the 16th, we have Sonic... Well, obviously, it's the Spanish cube if it's El Cubo.

01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:17.861
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it's El Cubo, maybe.

01:39:18.821 --> 01:39:19.362
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no cube.

01:39:20.176 --> 01:39:46.490
[SPEAKER_10]: 16th we have Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed and Sims 3 The Seasons you know what I quit Sims 3 after World Adventures because I had way too much custom content that it lagged my game it was really El Cubo is the re-release of the GameCube the Latin America version for England well they like to mix it up a bit somehow I don't think that's Castilian Spanish

01:39:48.786 --> 01:39:52.448
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, I may be an expert at Spanish, but that sounds pretty sound to me.

01:39:53.928 --> 01:39:55.689
[SPEAKER_05]: L anything is Spanish.

01:39:57.630 --> 01:39:58.391
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be Portuguese.

01:39:59.671 --> 01:40:00.232
[SPEAKER_13]: It could be.

01:40:01.472 --> 01:40:05.254
[SPEAKER_13]: Or it could be moving on with more news in the Classic Game of the Week coming up real soon.

01:40:05.974 --> 01:40:06.294
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

01:40:07.055 --> 01:40:15.659
[SPEAKER_05]: So, as I kind of alluded to earlier with the need to sell some of those combo packs for UFC, THQ's not doing real well.

01:40:16.139 --> 01:40:17.080
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll see you next time.

01:40:41.189 --> 01:40:44.791
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem is, now their stock has dropped down to $1.74.

01:40:46.031 --> 01:40:44.791
42%.

01:40:46.111 --> 01:40:54.015
[SPEAKER_05]: So, if you think about it, those stocks really wouldn't be worth crap.

01:40:54.955 --> 01:40:56.456
[SPEAKER_05]: They'd be worth like 17 cents.

01:40:57.216 --> 01:40:57.737
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times.

01:40:57.957 --> 01:40:59.477
[SPEAKER_05]: Good times, yeah.

01:40:59.617 --> 01:41:01.178
[SPEAKER_05]: So, that is unfortunate.

01:41:01.458 --> 01:41:07.161
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, I'm sure it's not helping by the fact that a lot of those games have kind of

01:41:08.712 --> 01:41:10.835
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry, it actually closed down to 150.

01:41:11.456 --> 01:41:13.759
[SPEAKER_05]: It dropped even further, so 50%.

01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:20.368
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's probably not helping that a lot of the games that they were going to be coming out with have been delayed.

01:41:21.029 --> 01:41:24.073
[SPEAKER_05]: And I understand why they're doing it, and it's...

01:41:25.535 --> 01:41:28.536
[SPEAKER_05]: Shadow Next Gen follows that up with People said that six months ago.

01:41:44.881 --> 01:41:46.361
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:42:07.508 --> 01:42:24.758
[SPEAKER_05]: and you know even as you know kind of alluded to they were saying you know when I joined THQ the company made a public commitment to the quality of titles and we've always expected that in some cases this would mean that more time would be needed to make sure that every title is of the highest possible quality

01:42:25.898 --> 01:42:38.262
[SPEAKER_05]: Our fourth quarter releases are the first titles that I have that had the ability to materially impact an experience told me that games needed additional development time to be market ready.

01:42:39.142 --> 01:42:44.584
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for releasing games that are polished as opposed to just putting them out there because

01:42:46.035 --> 01:42:46.736
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to make money.

01:42:47.316 --> 01:42:56.865
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's hope that that actually pays off and these games are even better than what they would have been had they just put them out when they were ready to put them out.

01:42:57.445 --> 01:42:57.926
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see.

01:42:58.506 --> 01:43:06.754
[SPEAKER_05]: However, that's still not helping the fact that they defaulted on their $50 million loan that they had with Wells Fargo.

01:43:07.495 --> 01:43:09.777
[SPEAKER_05]: So not too good.

01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:12.220
[SPEAKER_05]: Sad Trombone

01:43:26.792 --> 01:43:27.092
[SPEAKER_05]: Not good.

01:43:27.432 --> 01:43:33.995
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully they will be able to kind of recoup from all these losses and stuff and put out some good games.

01:43:34.415 --> 01:43:36.716
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, after all, South Park looks awesome.

01:43:37.376 --> 01:43:40.857
[SPEAKER_05]: Not a big fan of Company of Heroes, but Metro Last Light looks pretty sweet.

01:43:41.778 --> 01:43:43.598
[SPEAKER_13]: And you need a Saints Row 4, right?

01:43:43.918 --> 01:43:45.599
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what Rama in our chat room just said.

01:43:45.839 --> 01:43:52.364
[SPEAKER_13]: You know... They better give me my Saints Row 4 before they go down like a claim.

01:43:52.484 --> 01:43:53.745
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me put it this way.

01:43:54.185 --> 01:43:59.929
[SPEAKER_05]: Saints Row, what they were planning to do with that, the whole Enter the Dominatrix thing, which, to be honest, looked like shit.

01:44:00.910 --> 01:44:03.231
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have still bought it, but it still looks like shit.

01:44:04.052 --> 01:44:06.734
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're making a fourth game that's supposed to be better, but...

01:44:07.234 --> 01:44:07.695
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

01:44:33.278 --> 01:44:37.622
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, let's move on to some announcements from Blizzard, who also had an earnings call this week.

01:44:38.503 --> 01:44:45.510
[SPEAKER_13]: StarCraft II Heart of the Swarm, this expansion they've been working on for quite a while, is finally due out in the first half of 2013.

01:44:45.590 --> 01:44:49.594
[SPEAKER_13]: That's according to Mike Morhaime, who is the head of Blizzard.

01:44:49.634 --> 01:44:52.116
[SPEAKER_13]: He did make that announcement during Activision's earnings call this week.

01:44:52.356 --> 01:44:56.259
[SPEAKER_13]: saying that they are, quote, working hard towards a first half 2013 launch.

01:44:56.599 --> 01:44:59.641
[SPEAKER_13]: That wouldn't be too surprising to anyone who's been following Blizzard for a while.

01:44:59.981 --> 01:45:07.686
[SPEAKER_13]: They put out two big games this year already between Diablo 3 and Mists of Pandaria, so them holding onto this for 2013 is no surprise at all.

01:45:08.147 --> 01:45:14.311
[SPEAKER_13]: I would think, though, it's going to happen after the end of the fiscal quarter to give them something to buoy up the next fiscal year.

01:45:14.591 --> 01:45:15.071
[SPEAKER_13]: But we'll see.

01:45:15.171 --> 01:45:15.432
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see.

01:45:16.392 --> 01:45:26.398
[SPEAKER_13]: Speaking of Diablo 3, they have surpassed 10 million sold and it was confirmed to I'm sure no one's surprise an expansion for Diablo 3 is in the works.

01:45:26.858 --> 01:45:31.181
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd be very curious to see how that expansion does though because let's not forget a lot of those Diablo 3s

01:45:31.761 --> 01:45:33.001
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, maybe that's not fair.

01:45:33.041 --> 01:45:37.503
[SPEAKER_13]: I was going to say a lot, but it's more like a million came through that annual pass.

01:45:37.863 --> 01:45:39.304
[SPEAKER_13]: And I guess one million out of ten million.

01:45:39.324 --> 01:45:41.224
[SPEAKER_05]: Still ten percent is pretty big.

01:45:41.304 --> 01:45:42.525
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'd be very curious.

01:45:42.865 --> 01:45:46.266
[SPEAKER_13]: Diablo 3 hasn't exactly had the warmest reception either.

01:45:46.586 --> 01:45:48.327
[SPEAKER_13]: It has its fans, certainly.

01:45:48.767 --> 01:45:52.848
[SPEAKER_13]: But I just don't hear about it the same way I heard the enthusiasm for Diablo 2.

01:45:53.509 --> 01:45:56.069
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know some Diablo fans might want to challenge me on that, and that's fine.

01:45:56.089 --> 01:45:59.431
[SPEAKER_13]: But I don't hear that same enthusiasm that I heard behind Diablo 2.

01:46:00.852 --> 01:46:03.206
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd be very curious how an expansion is going to do for them.

01:46:04.721 --> 01:46:06.622
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm sure it would be as well received as Starcraft 2.

01:46:06.662 --> 01:46:12.206
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, Starcraft 2 also, you know, it's popular but not popular like Starcraft 1 was.

01:46:12.226 --> 01:46:13.527
[SPEAKER_13]: Does that make sense?

01:46:13.727 --> 01:46:14.047
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

01:46:15.068 --> 01:46:19.751
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, a class action lawsuit being filed against Blizzard.

01:46:21.392 --> 01:46:24.034
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, they make World of Warcraft, Starcraft, Diablo 3.

01:46:24.694 --> 01:46:26.916
[SPEAKER_13]: It has to do with the authenticators.

01:46:27.977 --> 01:46:32.640
[SPEAKER_13]: Apparently, who are the guys that are filing this lawsuit here?

01:46:35.462 --> 01:46:39.226
[SPEAKER_13]: and Carnie William Bates Pullum and Bowman PLLC.

01:46:39.446 --> 01:46:41.989
[SPEAKER_13]: They are litigating Benjamin Bell et al.

01:46:42.049 --> 01:46:51.099
[SPEAKER_13]: versus Blizzard Entertainment saying that all of this is negligent and deceptive practices related to Blizzard's customers' account security.

01:46:51.179 --> 01:46:52.440
[SPEAKER_13]: The fact that for Blizzard

01:46:52.680 --> 01:46:53.660
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't they have a PC app now?

01:46:53.700 --> 01:46:54.061
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think so.

01:46:54.101 --> 01:46:54.681
[SPEAKER_13]: Just on smartphones.

01:46:54.701 --> 01:46:54.861
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe.

01:46:54.881 --> 01:46:55.221
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

01:46:55.241 --> 01:46:57.422
[SPEAKER_13]: I've had the smartphone one for so long, I don't know.

01:46:57.442 --> 01:46:58.602
[SPEAKER_13]: The claim is drawing against the August 9th.

01:47:20.331 --> 01:47:24.895
[SPEAKER_13]: Battle.net breach where Blizzard, they actually disclosed that yes, people got in.

01:47:25.516 --> 01:47:29.560
[SPEAKER_13]: They didn't get any sensitive information, but we're making people reset their passwords anyways.

01:47:30.220 --> 01:47:39.189
[SPEAKER_13]: And the lawsuit saying that Blizzard's negligence in maintaining proper security protocols is resulting in deceptive upselling.

01:47:39.489 --> 01:47:49.171
[SPEAKER_13]: So in other words, because Blizzard can't protect their shit or is negligent in protecting their shit, they're selling you an authenticator so that they're making you buy this to protect your shit.

01:47:49.191 --> 01:48:01.253
[SPEAKER_10]: That's going to get thrown out because, honestly, I've had an authenticator for years and it hasn't done a damn thing for anyone getting in and getting any information.

01:48:02.693 --> 01:48:04.714
[SPEAKER_10]: The authenticator had nothing to do with it.

01:48:05.154 --> 01:48:05.714
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't...

01:48:07.415 --> 01:48:10.577
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that they got encrypted data.

01:48:10.937 --> 01:48:11.297
[SPEAKER_10]: What was it?

01:48:11.377 --> 01:48:12.137
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing solid?

01:48:12.518 --> 01:48:17.481
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was anything that could have been changed immediately that wouldn't have changed his present level of security.

01:48:17.981 --> 01:48:19.081
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, here's the thing, though.

01:48:19.161 --> 01:48:23.244
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, as much as I do think, I agree with you, it's going to get thrown out of court.

01:48:23.744 --> 01:48:31.328
[SPEAKER_13]: But I would like to know, why were so many Blizzard accounts hacked before the mobile authenticator came out?

01:48:31.628 --> 01:48:36.451
[SPEAKER_13]: Because there was about a year gap where you only had the $6.50 ones.

01:48:36.511 --> 01:48:43.095
[SPEAKER_13]: And as a Warcraft player, I did feel like, why are they making me buy an authenticator when they can't protect my shit?

01:48:43.695 --> 01:48:46.417
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was like, why are so many people getting hacked?

01:48:46.497 --> 01:48:47.257
[SPEAKER_13]: What happened here?

01:48:47.357 --> 01:48:48.698
[SPEAKER_13]: How did all our passwords get out?

01:48:49.178 --> 01:48:50.979
[SPEAKER_13]: I kind of would like that to come to light.

01:48:51.140 --> 01:48:55.243
[SPEAKER_13]: I would like to know how many million people have had to call Blizzard because of an account breach.

01:48:55.563 --> 01:49:07.012
[SPEAKER_10]: Granted, I think that the authenticator was more put out as something that was for peace of mind because I've done remote work where I had to have an on-site authenticator to get into the server.

01:49:07.572 --> 01:49:11.736
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's basically an added layer of protection on user side.

01:49:12.296 --> 01:49:17.781
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that it doesn't really matter how much security you have on the website.

01:49:17.821 --> 01:49:19.382
[SPEAKER_10]: If someone wants to get in, they're going to get in.

01:49:20.283 --> 01:49:23.526
[SPEAKER_10]: So this basically just gives you an extra layer.

01:49:24.967 --> 01:49:29.231
[SPEAKER_05]: And if anything, I would think that the authenticator price was just to cover the cost of the actual authenticator.

01:49:29.251 --> 01:49:31.973
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think they're actually profiting off of it because if...

01:49:33.206 --> 01:49:41.432
[SPEAKER_05]: It was something that required having a device in your hands to basically pair the random numbers with.

01:49:43.274 --> 01:49:58.486
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like something that you... Obviously, once smartphones came out to the masses and everything like that, they could do an app instead, but that's probably why they had to sell it in the first place, because they don't want to lose $6.50 on every single one they send out for people.

01:49:58.746 --> 01:49:59.086
[SPEAKER_05]: Granted...

01:49:59.927 --> 01:50:03.071
[SPEAKER_13]: They should have just included it in the collector's edition, though.

01:50:03.291 --> 01:50:03.751
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

01:50:03.871 --> 01:50:05.113
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't understand why they didn't include it.

01:50:05.133 --> 01:50:06.334
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they do that, actually, in some of them?

01:50:06.694 --> 01:50:06.815
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

01:50:06.915 --> 01:50:09.858
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought that they had one of the expansions that had an authenticator in there.

01:50:10.098 --> 01:50:11.700
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think it was Warcraft.

01:50:13.021 --> 01:50:14.881
[SPEAKER_13]: Might have been StarCraft, but I don't remember.

01:50:14.901 --> 01:50:16.442
[SPEAKER_10]: They were just handing them out at cons.

01:50:16.782 --> 01:50:17.622
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but that's different.

01:50:19.302 --> 01:50:19.582
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

01:50:19.983 --> 01:50:25.264
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyhow, we need to take a time back into classic gaming and classic games history.

01:50:25.764 --> 01:50:28.744
[SPEAKER_13]: And remember when things weren't so simple and so much shit was getting hacked.

01:50:29.945 --> 01:50:31.765
[SPEAKER_13]: At least I don't think this game ever got hacked.

01:50:32.225 --> 01:50:33.025
[SPEAKER_13]: Wrong hacks.

01:50:33.105 --> 01:50:33.486
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

01:50:33.606 --> 01:50:35.366
[SPEAKER_13]: It stole your credit card information.

01:50:36.069 --> 01:50:37.009
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:51:05.540 --> 01:51:06.600
[SPEAKER_13]: I like this one.

01:51:07.201 --> 01:51:10.221
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm surprised I haven't done it because I actually really like Super Pac-Man.

01:51:11.422 --> 01:51:18.064
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, the thing that I linked is basically someone figuring out the ghost patterns in the game and totally manipulating a full game.

01:51:21.005 --> 01:51:27.747
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, in Super Pac-Man, it was the second game in the series that was actually done by Namco.

01:51:28.207 --> 01:51:28.367
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

01:51:28.407 --> 01:51:29.887
[SPEAKER_10]: Pac-Man was done by Midway.

01:51:31.648 --> 01:51:34.209
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a true Namco sequel

01:51:35.189 --> 01:51:40.711
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, people didn't really care for it as much because it changed the gameplay really radically.

01:51:42.251 --> 01:51:48.753
[SPEAKER_10]: It actually, in the game, you actually went around and ate fruit instead of the little power pills.

01:51:49.053 --> 01:51:52.994
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you did get special pellets.

01:51:53.054 --> 01:51:57.595
[SPEAKER_10]: You had your regular power pills, which you could use to eat ghosts.

01:51:58.275 --> 01:52:03.739
[SPEAKER_10]: You had keys that you could get to unlock doors so that you could get to the fruits inside.

01:52:04.340 --> 01:52:06.021
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you had super pellets.

01:52:06.201 --> 01:52:11.765
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you got the super pellet, then you would turn into Super Pac-Man and could go through doors and fly over everything.

01:52:12.126 --> 01:52:14.568
[SPEAKER_10]: And you had a button that would make you go faster.

01:52:16.269 --> 01:52:24.095
[SPEAKER_10]: On top of that, there was a little neat... I thought it was a neat little effect where the ghosts would kind of flatten down a bit to make it look like you were really flying over them.

01:52:25.095 --> 01:52:25.196
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

01:52:25.976 --> 01:52:39.173
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, you could not eat a ghost, a super Pac-Man, but if you ate a power pill, like a regular power pill while you were in super mode, then you could eat ghosts.

01:52:40.595 --> 01:52:40.675
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

01:52:42.196 --> 01:53:09.962
[SPEAKER_10]: the big thing about that is you also had bonus levels too after every second level where basically you just try to go through and eat the fruit and everything as fast as you can with this one it's actually one of the first Pac-Man games that used the Motorola 6809 processor the previous one used the Z80 and so this went into the same category as Galaxian for the conversion class and

01:53:12.162 --> 01:53:19.585
[SPEAKER_10]: However, it didn't really prove to be very successful because it was actually very different than the usual gameplay.

01:53:19.625 --> 01:53:21.065
[SPEAKER_13]: It was kind of fucking weird, actually.

01:53:21.145 --> 01:53:21.485
[SPEAKER_10]: It was.

01:53:21.945 --> 01:53:26.207
[SPEAKER_10]: Pac-Man Plus, which was just an updated version of the original, kind of like Ms.

01:53:26.227 --> 01:53:30.328
[SPEAKER_10]: Pac-Man, basically outsold it.

01:53:30.468 --> 01:53:40.032
[SPEAKER_10]: Midway also did Junior Pac-Man, which also went on the old Z80 processor, and that one also went to be a very successful Pac-Man game.

01:53:40.872 --> 01:53:47.097
[SPEAKER_10]: However, they do say that the AI for Super Pac-Man is one of the best of that time.

01:53:48.798 --> 01:53:51.740
[SPEAKER_10]: Super Pac-Man has been out on a lot of different systems.

01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:57.905
[SPEAKER_10]: In 84 there was a port for the Atari 5200, but it never came out because of the video game crash.

01:53:58.025 --> 01:53:59.786
[SPEAKER_13]: Why is he eating shoes in this level?

01:53:59.826 --> 01:54:00.667
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't eat shoes.

01:54:00.867 --> 01:54:01.387
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

01:54:01.688 --> 01:54:04.530
[SPEAKER_13]: I get the donuts and the burgers and the apples, but shoes?

01:54:04.950 --> 01:54:05.630
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't eat shoes.

01:54:06.531 --> 01:54:08.434
[SPEAKER_10]: Leather.

01:54:09.456 --> 01:54:13.262
[SPEAKER_10]: In 1988, there was a Dawson Commodore 64 version that came out by Thunder Mountain.

01:54:13.903 --> 01:54:14.503
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you have this?

01:54:14.564 --> 01:54:15.144
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, Commodore 64.

01:54:17.015 --> 01:54:24.479
[SPEAKER_10]: In 96, it showed up on the A for the Namco Museum Arcade Compilation on the PlayStation.

01:54:24.559 --> 01:54:30.522
[SPEAKER_10]: In 98, it came out for Namco History Volume 3, and that was on the PC in Japan only.

01:54:30.822 --> 01:54:33.403
[SPEAKER_10]: In 99, Super Pac-Man was released with Ms.

01:54:33.443 --> 01:54:34.664
[SPEAKER_10]: Pac-Man in Ms.

01:54:34.684 --> 01:54:37.065
[SPEAKER_10]: Pac-Man Special Color Edition for the Game Boy Color.

01:54:37.285 --> 01:54:38.546
[SPEAKER_10]: I had that, and I played the crap.

01:54:40.167 --> 01:54:47.153
[SPEAKER_10]: 2006, there was a plug and play Super Pac-Man that included that along with Pac-Man, Pac-Man Plus, and Pac and Pal.

01:54:47.494 --> 01:54:49.836
[SPEAKER_10]: Which, honestly, Pac and Pal is seriously not one of my favorites.

01:54:51.197 --> 01:54:56.821
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it also came in the TV games Pac-Man Gold Edition and the Retro Arcade.

01:54:57.422 --> 01:55:02.987
[SPEAKER_10]: Namco has also done a portable version for cell phones that are put out by Sprint.

01:55:05.109 --> 01:55:12.160
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, Sprint and Namco actually had a sweepstakes where you could win a Volkswagen New Beetle customized with Super Pac-Man art.

01:55:12.841 --> 01:55:14.424
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was on display at E3 in 2006.

01:55:14.584 --> 01:55:16.447
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you revert this?

01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:19.601
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:55:46.574 --> 01:55:50.018
[SPEAKER_10]: and then we have it on the Namco Museum Virtual Arcade for Xbox 360 that came out in 2008.

01:55:51.380 --> 01:55:51.820
[SPEAKER_10]: So there you go.

01:55:52.661 --> 01:55:53.182
[SPEAKER_10]: Super Pac-Man.

01:55:53.956 --> 01:55:56.857
[SPEAKER_13]: There it is, your classic game of the week, Super Pac-Man.

01:55:56.998 --> 01:55:58.638
[SPEAKER_13]: I like this one, even though it was really weird.

01:55:58.979 --> 01:55:59.559
[SPEAKER_10]: It was weird.

01:55:59.999 --> 01:56:00.439
[SPEAKER_13]: I liked it.

01:56:00.459 --> 01:56:03.301
[SPEAKER_10]: But I mean, you know how I feel about weird.

01:56:03.381 --> 01:56:04.301
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that cutscene.

01:56:04.721 --> 01:56:05.522
[SPEAKER_10]: He's like, grin.

01:56:06.342 --> 01:56:10.744
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the one where a giant ball of Pac-Man falls on the ghost, they turn blue and squish.

01:56:10.764 --> 01:56:12.065
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't eat mushrooms.

01:56:12.245 --> 01:56:13.406
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of them are poisonous.

01:56:13.426 --> 01:56:14.446
[SPEAKER_10]: But what if they're shiitake?

01:56:14.486 --> 01:56:15.547
[SPEAKER_10]: Shiitake are delicious.

01:56:15.927 --> 01:56:16.647
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess that's right.

01:56:16.967 --> 01:56:21.550
[SPEAKER_10]: I made the best dinner that was shiitake mushrooms, enoki mushrooms, and...

01:56:23.462 --> 01:56:27.607
[SPEAKER_10]: God, now I can't remember, but there are these other little mushrooms that kind of join at the base, and you have to cut the base off.

01:56:27.647 --> 01:56:28.407
[SPEAKER_10]: It was so good anyway.

01:56:29.509 --> 01:56:30.870
[SPEAKER_05]: The front lawn mushrooms.

01:56:31.190 --> 01:56:32.772
[SPEAKER_10]: No, not front lawn mushrooms.

01:56:33.453 --> 01:56:34.174
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, anyhow.

01:56:34.895 --> 01:56:35.315
[SPEAKER_10]: Shimeji.

01:56:36.396 --> 01:56:36.656
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

01:56:36.677 --> 01:56:37.197
[SPEAKER_13]: They're so delicious.

01:56:37.257 --> 01:56:43.984
[SPEAKER_13]: Super Pac-Man, your classic game of the week, in a million different Namco collections, as Jamie mentioned there a little bit ago.

01:56:45.546 --> 01:56:47.328
[SPEAKER_13]: We're actually not taking a break tonight.

01:56:48.009 --> 01:56:50.832
[SPEAKER_13]: We have another interview, and this one's prior taped.

01:56:51.593 --> 01:57:04.146
[SPEAKER_13]: This is actually coming to us from DJ Ranma S and Anime Jam Session, which is a show you can hear at the Voice of Geeks Network or vognetwork.com on Tuesday nights, replaying on Thursday mornings.

01:57:04.646 --> 01:57:17.229
[SPEAKER_13]: and at a recent convention, Ranma got this interview with Jen and she is with the website, I don't want to mess this up, it's ggvogue.com, g-g-v-o-g-u-e.com.

01:57:17.509 --> 01:57:26.411
[SPEAKER_13]: That is Girl Gamer Vogue and Ranma is going to ask her in this interview some questions about the website and why she started it and all that good stuff.

01:57:26.471 --> 01:57:31.672
[SPEAKER_13]: So take it away, DJ Ranma S. We'll be back after this interview with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:57:31.692 --> 01:57:33.773
[SPEAKER_13]: It's about a 10-minute interview, so we'll be back after this.

01:57:34.113 --> 01:57:35.174
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, DJ Ranma S here.

01:57:35.234 --> 01:57:37.736
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here on a special trip here in New York City.

01:57:37.776 --> 01:57:38.657
[SPEAKER_03]: We're traveling around.

01:57:38.958 --> 01:57:40.819
[SPEAKER_03]: We're out on a special mission.

01:57:40.859 --> 01:57:44.042
[SPEAKER_03]: We're checking out a special event called New York City Girl Gamer Event.

01:57:44.062 --> 01:57:44.683
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that correct?

01:57:44.823 --> 01:57:45.003
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

01:57:45.484 --> 01:57:45.824
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

01:57:45.984 --> 01:57:47.606
[SPEAKER_03]: And my guest here, please introduce yourself.

01:57:47.886 --> 01:57:49.948
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Jennifer, a.k.a.

01:57:49.988 --> 01:57:52.050
[SPEAKER_01]: Nars from Girl Gamer Vogue.

01:57:53.434 --> 01:57:57.897
[SPEAKER_03]: Girl Gamer VOG here to get girls out to play all types of video games and so forth.

01:57:57.917 --> 01:58:00.298
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that pretty much what the point of tonight's meetup is?

01:58:00.699 --> 01:58:01.459
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

01:58:01.980 --> 01:58:10.605
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely try to get girls from all over the Tri-State area to kind of just get together, to meet other girls, to find other venues and genres that they play with.

01:58:10.885 --> 01:58:15.388
[SPEAKER_01]: and just to have an atmosphere in a community that they feel pretty proud and comfortable in.

01:58:16.288 --> 01:58:28.776
[SPEAKER_01]: Our number one passion and mission is to just provide a wonderful atmosphere for girl gamers and empower and inspire them actually because ultimately girls need that community.

01:58:28.856 --> 01:58:30.197
[SPEAKER_01]: We need that community.

01:58:30.257 --> 01:58:35.080
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to find other girls who play games and just play.

01:58:35.640 --> 01:58:36.481
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds pretty cool.

01:58:36.561 --> 01:58:38.682
[SPEAKER_03]: So what made you come up with this whole idea?

01:58:39.444 --> 01:58:43.249
[SPEAKER_01]: To be honest, I've been gaming ever since I was like five.

01:58:43.329 --> 01:58:49.155
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I remember having an NES and just playing it and it was actually taken away from me by my uncle.

01:58:49.295 --> 01:58:52.359
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was really a hardcore Sega fan.

01:58:52.399 --> 01:58:57.104
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a hardcore Sega fan up until the Dreamcast when it actually kind of just like fell off the face of the earth.

01:58:57.164 --> 01:58:59.026
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, now they're more of a software company.

01:58:59.366 --> 01:59:04.670
[SPEAKER_01]: But I always realized and remembered feeling that I never had a girl that I could always play with.

01:59:05.150 --> 01:59:10.494
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to an all-girls school up until high school, and I never had the companionship.

01:59:10.654 --> 01:59:14.717
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw that the world lacked that, a place where you could find that companionship.

01:59:14.737 --> 01:59:26.446
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, yeah, you can go to forums, but there isn't a specific venue that you can kind of just find a girl that is looking for, you know, Guild Wars 2, you know, guildmate, or even if it's just Call of Duty.

01:59:26.666 --> 01:59:26.826
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

01:59:27.207 --> 01:59:27.527
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

01:59:28.237 --> 01:59:29.017
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds pretty cool.

01:59:29.038 --> 01:59:36.402
[SPEAKER_03]: So what makes Girl Gamer Bowl different from other female gamer clans like the D20 girls or something like that?

01:59:36.722 --> 01:59:37.983
[SPEAKER_03]: What makes it kind of different?

01:59:38.523 --> 01:59:40.585
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're not a clan per se.

01:59:41.225 --> 01:59:43.586
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a means to an end, if anything.

01:59:43.626 --> 01:59:50.511
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're looking for a clan, if you're looking for friends, we're the place that you would go to in order to find that clan.

01:59:50.831 --> 01:59:55.754
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're pretty much like the liaison to connect other gaming girls to other clans.

01:59:56.294 --> 01:59:59.096
[SPEAKER_03]: Groups and Clans and Teams and so forth.

01:59:59.216 --> 01:59:59.556
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

02:00:14.724 --> 02:00:18.927
[SPEAKER_01]: We also do kind of like 101 gaming for moms.

02:00:18.967 --> 02:00:25.471
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're a mom out there and your child is a son or a daughter who's really into games, we teach you about the ESRB rating.

02:00:25.511 --> 02:00:28.173
[SPEAKER_01]: We teach you about what games are good for your child.

02:00:28.433 --> 02:00:34.156
[SPEAKER_01]: We also talk about games you can play as a mom who's not very familiar with games as well.

02:00:34.537 --> 02:00:35.337
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds pretty cool.

02:00:35.357 --> 02:00:38.199
[SPEAKER_03]: So how long have you been running this organization?

02:00:38.837 --> 02:00:46.260
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, officially it's been running since November 2011, but, you know, it's always been a dream and a passion ever since I can remember, yeah.

02:00:47.281 --> 02:00:50.302
[SPEAKER_03]: So, where do you see this site going?

02:00:50.522 --> 02:00:51.803
[SPEAKER_03]: What's your vision for it?

02:00:52.603 --> 02:00:57.986
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I, you know, to be honest with anything, you know, I don't have any expectations when it comes to this.

02:00:58.026 --> 02:01:00.667
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of just like, I want to do more.

02:01:00.767 --> 02:01:07.090
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, we definitely want to be able to just bring more women and more girls and more gamers into this community because...

02:01:07.894 --> 02:01:16.540
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to become a positive representation of the gaming community because in actuality, that's how the gaming community started.

02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:21.944
[SPEAKER_01]: It started out with gamers very passionate about their hobbies and promoting it.

02:01:22.164 --> 02:01:28.668
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel right now, I'm not going to say it's unbalanced, but I feel like there's not a lot of representations for females.

02:01:28.708 --> 02:01:31.270
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot of places that they can go to

02:01:31.877 --> 02:01:38.242
[SPEAKER_01]: to either A, get the kind of newsfeeds they want, or B, get the kind of information they need.

02:01:38.902 --> 02:01:46.528
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about video game fashion, and we talk about this is actually a Legend of Zelda Zoro Sapphire from Ocarina of Time.

02:01:46.748 --> 02:01:48.490
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a jewel, but it's been made out of a necklace.

02:01:48.590 --> 02:01:51.652
[SPEAKER_01]: And we showcase things like that because they're important.

02:01:51.752 --> 02:01:58.057
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if a girl, or particularly a girl, if she wanted to buy that, she could be able to find it on our website.

02:01:58.077 --> 02:01:58.698
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty cool.

02:01:59.890 --> 02:02:01.731
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that concept.

02:02:02.011 --> 02:02:08.014
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying, I just like the idea of it and what you're working with and where it's going so far.

02:02:08.174 --> 02:02:08.674
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

02:02:08.754 --> 02:02:11.776
[SPEAKER_03]: So, outside of this, what kind of games do you like to play?

02:02:11.796 --> 02:02:15.017
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, what kind of games do I like to play?

02:02:15.177 --> 02:02:22.681
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, right now I'm playing Guild Wars 2 and I love Guild Wars 2 because I played Aeon and World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy and I played LOL and...

02:02:24.185 --> 02:02:30.250
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, I love, I don't like, okay, the I hit you, you hit me kind of gaming.

02:02:30.370 --> 02:02:36.635
[SPEAKER_01]: So Guild of Wars, I actually write for Game Tire and I wrote an article about the top 15 qualities for an MMORPG.

02:02:37.395 --> 02:02:44.061
[SPEAKER_01]: And Guild of Wars 2 just seems to be nailing 85-90% of anything that I was asking for an MMORPG.

02:02:44.821 --> 02:03:09.209
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted, it's not like WoW, because WoW will always, I mean, like, the endgame is just, like, the endgame, like, in Sins and Raids and World of Warcraft, it's just, you can't get that in Guild Wars 2, but Guild Wars 2 has just so much more opportunities for you to explore, like, you get, you know, you get points, and you get rewarding experiences for helping out, and I feel like Guild Wars 2 actually has, like, this social aspect.

02:03:10.330 --> 02:03:14.471
[SPEAKER_01]: I play, you know, mostly PS3 and PS2 and PS1 games, I am a Sony fan,

02:03:14.875 --> 02:03:16.856
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm completely a diehard Sega fan.

02:03:16.896 --> 02:03:18.016
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have my Sega Dreamcast.

02:03:18.076 --> 02:03:19.236
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have my Genesis.

02:03:19.637 --> 02:03:22.157
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't get a Saturn, but I do have a GameCube.

02:03:22.177 --> 02:03:24.558
[SPEAKER_03]: But do you also have a Master System?

02:03:25.519 --> 02:03:26.939
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have a Master System.

02:03:27.219 --> 02:03:28.900
[SPEAKER_03]: We might have to get her a Master System.

02:03:28.980 --> 02:03:29.860
[SPEAKER_03]: I would love a Master System.

02:03:30.776 --> 02:03:33.698
[SPEAKER_03]: I might know someone that may have a spare, but I'll have to double check with that.

02:03:34.498 --> 02:03:36.579
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that I didn't have it because I didn't want it.

02:03:36.679 --> 02:03:39.280
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have it because of fun reasons.

02:03:39.881 --> 02:03:41.261
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all good.

02:03:41.621 --> 02:03:48.865
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, while running around Game of Thrones, have you ever ran into any difficulties or any guys going, what, you know?

02:03:49.537 --> 02:03:56.699
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, to be honest, yeah, but if I stopped when I came about, I wouldn't be where I am right now.

02:03:56.719 --> 02:03:57.219
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good.

02:03:57.259 --> 02:04:06.081
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you really need to understand that you will come across people that want you to fail, but you gotta understand that you're doing something that's you.

02:04:06.481 --> 02:04:07.761
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you are a gamer.

02:04:07.921 --> 02:04:08.501
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a gamer.

02:04:08.601 --> 02:04:13.202
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know I'm a gamer, and I know what I'm doing, regardless of what anyone says, makes me happy.

02:04:13.702 --> 02:04:14.362
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there you go.

02:04:14.402 --> 02:04:17.243
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I can't argue with that type of logic, so...

02:04:17.602 --> 02:04:23.970
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we get out of here, do you have any last words for any game girls out there who are like, well, I don't know, you know.

02:04:24.711 --> 02:04:29.037
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, to be honest, you can deny being a gamer all you want.

02:04:30.084 --> 02:04:39.566
[SPEAKER_01]: The moment you embrace it and be who you are, even if you play Farmville, even if you play a 3DS, it doesn't matter.

02:04:40.146 --> 02:04:45.808
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're playing something that is immersed into a digital world, you're playing a game.

02:04:46.328 --> 02:04:54.269
[SPEAKER_01]: And you shouldn't, A, demote it as not being a game, and B, you shouldn't diminish anybody else that's following that.

02:04:54.890 --> 02:04:57.050
[SPEAKER_01]: The video game community is changing constantly.

02:04:57.370 --> 02:05:05.152
[SPEAKER_01]: to include everything from science to medicine to psychology to even the industry booming in business.

02:05:05.192 --> 02:05:07.633
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, even fashion is becoming a big part of it.

02:05:08.133 --> 02:05:17.916
[SPEAKER_01]: And the moment that you discriminate and divide yourself, you're becoming a factor in the divide in the gaming industry that me and many other people are fighting against.

02:05:18.676 --> 02:05:21.977
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, those are some strong, powerful words.

02:05:21.997 --> 02:05:25.118
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so let me ask you.

02:05:25.138 --> 02:05:25.418
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

02:05:26.823 --> 02:05:30.066
[SPEAKER_03]: Girl Gamer, Gamer Girl, doesn't really matter.

02:05:30.346 --> 02:05:31.187
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter.

02:05:31.507 --> 02:05:45.579
[SPEAKER_01]: What matters mostly is that if you say you're a girl gamer or a gamer girl and then you start posting photos with you with controllers covering your boobs, you're giving a terrible interpretation of what a girl gamer is.

02:05:46.360 --> 02:05:47.721
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the line.

02:05:48.021 --> 02:05:59.610
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are not a girl gamer and you're out there and you're promoting that you're a girl gamer and you're doing very sensual, provocative images and representation, you are hindering what we're working for.

02:06:00.090 --> 02:06:06.335
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm fighting so hard and many other women are fighting so hard to give a positive representation of girl gamers.

02:06:06.755 --> 02:06:11.298
[SPEAKER_01]: And if your house is directed to all you ladies that are out there that are doing this, stop.

02:06:12.159 --> 02:06:15.060
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're fighting for the right type of gamers.

02:06:15.460 --> 02:06:18.381
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're hurting us, you're an obstacle.

02:06:18.701 --> 02:06:23.203
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be honest, we will try everything possible to overrun it.

02:06:23.703 --> 02:06:29.524
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what you're doing is you're defeating us and you're contradicting what we're working so hard for.

02:06:29.565 --> 02:06:32.165
[SPEAKER_01]: There are people that are spending time, money, and effort.

02:06:32.185 --> 02:06:34.626
[SPEAKER_01]: There are women who are spending so much time, money, and effort.

02:06:34.866 --> 02:06:36.547
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're out there, just please stop.

02:06:37.627 --> 02:06:40.628
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to be sensual, if you want to be provocative, fine.

02:06:41.008 --> 02:06:42.149
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it without a controller.

02:06:42.189 --> 02:06:44.551
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it without saying that you're a girl gamer or a gamer girl.

02:06:44.831 --> 02:06:46.533
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're putting us in a bad light.

02:06:46.973 --> 02:06:51.657
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's disrespectful, it's hurtful, and it's obnoxious.

02:06:53.218 --> 02:06:56.080
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, like I said, those are some really powerful words.

02:06:56.601 --> 02:07:03.807
[SPEAKER_03]: So, for everyone that's out there watching, listening, where can they find more information about Girl Gamer VOG?

02:07:04.067 --> 02:07:06.469
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're at GGVOG, like G as in Gorilla.

02:07:07.062 --> 02:07:08.924
[SPEAKER_01]: GoGamingVogue.com or GoGamingVogue.

02:07:08.944 --> 02:07:13.489
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find us on Facebook, on Twitter, on Tumblr, on Instagram, on Flickr.

02:07:14.751 --> 02:07:17.013
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget what other place we're associated with.

02:07:17.574 --> 02:07:22.579
[SPEAKER_01]: By all means, we need more girls who are just as passionate and prominent that are looking for a place to call home.

02:07:23.841 --> 02:07:25.643
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the people, if not all, probably like 99%,

02:07:26.964 --> 02:07:55.605
[SPEAKER_01]: they are very comfortable people you want to talk about games, by all means we're associated with a bunch of other communities as well, and if you want to play Call of Duty, Guild Wars you know, whatever it is, we'll find you a place to find people, to find girls that you can be best friends with and that's what we only want to be, we want to be good friends with you wow, that's pretty good, well Jen, thank you for your time thank you for having me, thanks for coming hey, no problem, at least we can do whatever we can do for you, we're here for you DJ Ron Ness, signing off

02:08:01.849 --> 02:08:11.639
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio and thank you DJ Ranma S for that interview and especially Jen from Girl Gamer Vogue.

02:08:11.739 --> 02:08:12.380
[SPEAKER_13]: I like her.

02:08:12.700 --> 02:08:15.483
[SPEAKER_13]: She's really trying to do a good thing for the community.

02:08:15.864 --> 02:08:24.052
[SPEAKER_13]: I like when she was talking about educating people about the ESRB system and I really think and I hope everybody's listening to her when she talks about how...

02:08:24.753 --> 02:08:26.474
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura.com

02:08:49.623 --> 02:08:55.728
[SPEAKER_13]: And I want to get our listeners thinking about this, because I really liked what just happened there.

02:08:56.008 --> 02:09:09.638
[SPEAKER_13]: I like that a listener kind of contributed that particular segment, and it gave us something to play on the show that we could actually put on the podcast that was interesting to listen to, and that was something a little different and listener-created.

02:09:09.758 --> 02:09:09.978
[SPEAKER_13]: So...

02:09:10.899 --> 02:09:19.466
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to try, come December or so forth, we would like to try opening up our breaks to listener-created content.

02:09:20.107 --> 02:09:26.873
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, that particular piece was a little bit long, but we're talking, think about something maybe a minute and a half to two minutes long.

02:09:27.433 --> 02:09:28.494
[SPEAKER_13]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:09:49.194 --> 02:09:55.681
[SPEAKER_13]: You won't be able to actually represent OLR and go get interviews and say, oh, my interview is going to be on OLR.

02:09:55.741 --> 02:09:58.824
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, that's for myself, DarkSakura, and Loki to do.

02:09:59.305 --> 02:10:02.928
[SPEAKER_13]: But talk to us if you have some ideas along those lines.

02:10:02.988 --> 02:10:04.210
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see what we can arrange.

02:10:04.890 --> 02:10:11.117
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're going to represent OLR, we have to make sure that you're not going to do something that could anger a potential guest or what have you.

02:10:11.577 --> 02:10:12.978
[SPEAKER_13]: So just be thinking about that.

02:10:13.018 --> 02:10:14.800
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll give you more details in the coming weeks.

02:10:15.220 --> 02:10:22.066
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's something we're hoping to do on the show is institute user-created content in our breaks.

02:10:22.666 --> 02:10:23.307
[SPEAKER_13]: So awesome.

02:10:23.327 --> 02:10:25.629
[SPEAKER_10]: And remember, I am Omega.

02:10:28.747 --> 02:10:32.029
[SPEAKER_13]: Damn, apparently the live listeners lost the feed for a moment while I was making that pitch.

02:10:32.109 --> 02:10:42.135
[SPEAKER_13]: But once again, we're looking at doing listener-created content during the breaks instead of music in little two-minute chunks or less for whatever community it is that you're passionate about.

02:10:42.315 --> 02:10:49.980
[SPEAKER_13]: After all, it's the show where every gamer has a voice, and I think we've been neglecting one big way to get your voices on the show.

02:10:50.780 --> 02:10:52.962
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, OLR reporters, OLR freelancers.

02:10:53.042 --> 02:10:54.284
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm loving those terms in chat.

02:10:54.424 --> 02:10:54.824
[SPEAKER_13]: Perfect.

02:10:55.365 --> 02:10:57.527
[SPEAKER_13]: So more information to come in the coming weeks.

02:10:57.587 --> 02:11:01.290
[SPEAKER_13]: That's something we want to implement in January or excuse me, December.

02:11:02.371 --> 02:11:05.575
[SPEAKER_13]: Meanwhile, let's get back into some rapid fire news.

02:11:06.055 --> 02:11:06.856
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, start us off.

02:11:07.270 --> 02:11:07.570
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

02:11:08.090 --> 02:11:08.951
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's see.

02:11:09.111 --> 02:11:12.733
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk a little bit about Black Ops 2 since that's going to be coming out this week.

02:11:13.133 --> 02:11:20.757
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things that they just recently announced before they had the whole streaming that you can do of your gameplay with the league play and stuff like that.

02:11:21.197 --> 02:11:26.200
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now it's been confirmed that that's going to be linked in with YouTube live streaming.

02:11:26.660 --> 02:11:32.963
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're going to be able to live stream on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and on the PC version as well.

02:11:33.483 --> 02:11:40.247
[SPEAKER_05]: No word on the Wii U yet because a lot of the integration that they have with Elite and stuff like that in the Wii U doesn't quite work, but it's pretty cool.

02:11:40.427 --> 02:11:48.792
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I guess you're going to be able to see the player's gamer card of whoever you're streaming and some other additional information like class loadouts and stats and stuff like that.

02:11:49.452 --> 02:11:49.872
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty cool.

02:11:49.892 --> 02:11:54.295
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually did spot some of this stuff when I was doing the local play stuff.

02:11:54.835 --> 02:11:58.898
[SPEAKER_05]: They had some options for that, but really neat that you'll be able to livestream games.

02:11:58.918 --> 02:12:00.939
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of wish they had that for Grand Theft Auto, but...

02:12:01.539 --> 02:12:02.480
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:12:17.955 --> 02:12:18.255
[SPEAKER_05]: It's neat.

02:12:18.375 --> 02:12:23.177
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's cool too because a lot of people don't have the hardware to like kind of video capture everything that they're doing.

02:12:23.217 --> 02:12:25.778
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is kind of built into the game, which I think is pretty cool.

02:12:25.798 --> 02:12:28.520
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's fascinating how the industry is really embracing it too.

02:12:28.620 --> 02:12:37.424
[SPEAKER_13]: I would have assumed there was going to be resistance to it, especially, you know, we talked about the Microsoft policy and all that stuff some time ago, you know, which is kind of this strange in the middle place.

02:12:37.464 --> 02:12:47.308
[SPEAKER_13]: But it is very interesting how, you know, instead of the game companies going to try and shut down places like Twitch TV and the other streaming sites, they're really saying, all right,

02:12:47.789 --> 02:12:51.288
[SPEAKER_13]: This is something people want to do It's a promotion for our game Let's do it

02:12:51.809 --> 02:12:51.969
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

02:12:52.409 --> 02:12:53.590
[SPEAKER_05]: Now here's a weird promotion.

02:12:53.610 --> 02:13:03.373
[SPEAKER_05]: They're doing something with Halo 4 and their multiplayer where they're actually allowing players to get Microsoft points for playing multiplayer.

02:13:03.813 --> 02:13:04.493
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's how it works.

02:13:04.573 --> 02:13:13.095
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so basically if you get Halo 4 and you play 35 hours plus, and this is between launch until the end of this month.

02:13:13.275 --> 02:13:15.196
[SPEAKER_05]: So November 30th is a cutoff for it.

02:13:15.516 --> 02:13:19.677
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you play over 35 hours, you're going to get 100 Microsoft points.

02:13:19.697 --> 02:13:20.398
[SPEAKER_05]: Whoopee!

02:13:21.818 --> 02:13:22.919
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, whoopty shit.

02:13:22.999 --> 02:13:25.942
[SPEAKER_05]: Woo, a dollar and like 20 cents or something.

02:13:26.342 --> 02:13:29.845
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so then if you play $1.25, that's what it was.

02:13:29.865 --> 02:13:30.306
[SPEAKER_05]: 70 hours, guess what?

02:13:35.751 --> 02:13:36.512
[SPEAKER_05]: You're gonna double that.

02:13:37.272 --> 02:13:38.353
[SPEAKER_05]: Or I'm sorry, you're gonna triple that.

02:13:38.533 --> 02:13:40.555
[SPEAKER_05]: You're gonna get 300 Microsoft points.

02:13:41.196 --> 02:13:45.139
[SPEAKER_05]: Yay, a denomination that totally doesn't round out anything.

02:13:45.259 --> 02:13:50.384
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're gonna have 300 Microsoft points possible there for you guys.

02:13:51.124 --> 02:13:56.529
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, if you happen to play over 140 hours... Was this only online multiplayer?

02:13:56.889 --> 02:14:15.042
[SPEAKER_13]: this is only online multiplayer Halo 4 matchmaking or custom or does it say it's multiplayer over Xbox Live so I could make a custom match set the timer to unlimited have it run all day have me and my friends set up a custom match have the timer run all day and I could do that right

02:14:16.559 --> 02:14:19.080
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if they'd let you do that.

02:14:19.180 --> 02:14:22.962
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be a big waste of time, but I suppose you could do that.

02:14:23.822 --> 02:14:28.764
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be up to 800 Microsoft points.

02:14:28.924 --> 02:14:32.106
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of confused as to where they're going to get this 800 Microsoft points.

02:14:33.866 --> 02:14:34.366
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry.

02:14:34.426 --> 02:14:40.429
[SPEAKER_05]: The extra 200 is coming from spending at least 3,000 Microsoft points on the Halo Marketplace content.

02:14:42.375 --> 02:14:46.617
[SPEAKER_05]: Woohoo, 200 points back after spending 3,000... So it's like a dinky $2 rebate.

02:14:47.457 --> 02:14:55.940
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, 3,000 Microsoft points, which is the equivalent of almost... What is that?

02:14:55.960 --> 02:14:55.940
$40?

02:14:57.681 --> 02:14:58.041
[SPEAKER_05]: Almost?

02:14:59.621 --> 02:14:59.981
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

02:15:00.882 --> 02:15:03.243
[SPEAKER_05]: All the point values are just... It's annoying.

02:15:04.623 --> 02:15:05.644
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, there you have it.

02:15:05.824 --> 02:15:07.484
[SPEAKER_05]: Some money back if you do that.

02:15:07.904 --> 02:15:08.845
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess also if you...

02:15:11.710 --> 02:15:12.131
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

02:15:12.311 --> 02:15:17.056
[SPEAKER_05]: If you spend, I guess, 1,500 Microsoft points, you get 100 Microsoft points back.

02:15:18.577 --> 02:15:20.239
[SPEAKER_05]: Fantastic, I guess.

02:15:20.900 --> 02:15:26.045
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is kind of neat, though, to see that you can earn some Microsoft points for playing a game for a long period of time.

02:15:26.626 --> 02:15:29.589
[SPEAKER_05]: YYR says it's more like a thank you to the people who are going to do it anyway.

02:15:30.249 --> 02:15:43.175
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's just trying to get people to play a long time so that they can try to beat up Black Ops 2, which is probably going to dominate multiplayer and have it look nice when Halo 4 is at the top of the charts there, but it's going to be tough.

02:15:45.007 --> 02:15:49.768
[SPEAKER_05]: And last but not least, there's been a lot of information regarding Grand Theft Auto V coming out.

02:15:50.168 --> 02:15:53.609
[SPEAKER_05]: All of this coming from the brand new issue of Game Informer.

02:15:54.989 --> 02:16:12.133
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of details regarding kind of the single-player campaign, including, you know, first off, the game's map itself is going to be over... It's going to be bigger than Grand Theft Auto IV, San Andreas, and Red Dead Redemption combined.

02:16:12.413 --> 02:16:12.933
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just the...

02:16:14.053 --> 02:16:14.814
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a big map.

02:16:33.348 --> 02:16:34.109
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember.

02:16:34.469 --> 02:16:35.509
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, anyways, that's not important.

02:16:36.010 --> 02:16:37.751
[SPEAKER_05]: But three different people you get to play as.

02:16:38.051 --> 02:16:41.813
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, they're going to have some different locations available in the game.

02:16:42.313 --> 02:16:51.139
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the stuff, obviously, you've seen in the trailers, including stuff based off of the vineyard areas.

02:16:51.679 --> 02:16:58.403
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, like Rockford Hills, which is like Beverly Hills, Blaine County, which is kind of like this desert.

02:16:58.924 --> 02:17:01.005
[SPEAKER_05]: They say they have bikers and meth heads in there.

02:17:02.506 --> 02:17:02.906
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, goody.

02:17:02.946 --> 02:17:06.209
[SPEAKER_05]: Vespucci Beach, which is similar, I guess, to Venice Beach.

02:17:07.049 --> 02:17:08.931
[SPEAKER_05]: Also like some beachfronts and stuff like that.

02:17:09.331 --> 02:17:15.616
[SPEAKER_05]: They're saying also the game's going to have a salt and sea region, a military base, suburban hills.

02:17:15.976 --> 02:17:22.381
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a Mount Chiliad, I guess, which is a large wilderness area where you can explore all that.

02:17:22.621 --> 02:17:27.945
[SPEAKER_05]: They're also going to have underwater areas that you can scuba dive in and stuff like that.

02:17:28.985 --> 02:17:34.468
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got this brand new engine that has multi-mile draw distances in there.

02:17:35.029 --> 02:17:37.790
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess also you're going to be able to do all sorts of things.

02:17:38.411 --> 02:17:42.073
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a golf course that you can play a full round of golf in if you really want to.

02:17:42.233 --> 02:17:44.114
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

02:17:44.154 --> 02:17:45.174
[SPEAKER_05]: All sorts of details.

02:17:46.395 --> 02:17:48.236
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as I can beat people with my clubs.

02:17:48.776 --> 02:17:49.837
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the fun part.

02:17:50.277 --> 02:17:57.863
[SPEAKER_05]: Bowling, strip clubs, stand-up comedy acts, TV shows, internet cafes, kind of all similar to what they had before.

02:17:57.903 --> 02:18:01.986
[SPEAKER_05]: You can also, I guess, go to the gym, you can attend a sermon.

02:18:02.386 --> 02:18:08.410
[SPEAKER_05]: They've got yoga, triathlons that you can do, base jumping, tennis, jet skiing.

02:18:09.291 --> 02:18:13.654
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, they're getting rid of the romance stuff in there because that was fucking annoying.

02:18:13.934 --> 02:18:14.595
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:18:32.626 --> 02:18:48.370
[SPEAKER_05]: So, the three characters, Michael, who I guess is the guy who did the voiceover in the first trailer, he's a retired bank robber, and now he's kind of on the FIB, which, you know, the FBI Witness Protection Program, or he's, you know...

02:18:49.693 --> 02:18:50.154
[SPEAKER_05]: ReepoMan

02:19:11.514 --> 02:19:13.415
[SPEAKER_05]: But lots of screenshots.

02:19:13.455 --> 02:19:14.495
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks fantastic.

02:19:14.876 --> 02:19:18.317
[SPEAKER_05]: And new trailer going to be coming out on the 14th this week.

02:19:18.417 --> 02:19:20.999
[SPEAKER_05]: So very excited by that.

02:19:21.399 --> 02:19:25.421
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is definitely a game I'm highly, highly looking forward to.

02:19:25.461 --> 02:19:26.121
[SPEAKER_05]: No fanboy involved.

02:19:26.181 --> 02:19:26.921
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, not at all.

02:19:26.941 --> 02:19:28.182
[SPEAKER_13]: Biggest game next year.

02:19:28.502 --> 02:19:31.403
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, some rapid fire news for me.

02:19:31.823 --> 02:19:34.724
[SPEAKER_13]: Gamefly's digital PC client is now out.

02:19:34.824 --> 02:19:37.185
[SPEAKER_13]: It was in beta for a while, but it is now officially out.

02:19:38.165 --> 02:19:39.705
[SPEAKER_13]: You can download this if you're anybody.

02:19:39.725 --> 02:19:41.606
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't have to be a Gamefly subscriber to get it.

02:19:41.986 --> 02:19:42.766
[SPEAKER_13]: Anybody can have it.

02:19:43.486 --> 02:19:45.287
[SPEAKER_13]: Over 1,500 Windows and Mac titles.

02:19:45.307 --> 02:19:48.468
[SPEAKER_13]: This is sounding a little bit like a commercial, but it's been around on the game blogs.

02:19:49.628 --> 02:19:54.290
[SPEAKER_13]: If you are a member, you should be aware, because I know a lot of you guys are, you can do the whole unlimited PC play.

02:19:54.330 --> 02:19:55.590
[SPEAKER_13]: It's pretty much GameTap.

02:19:57.013 --> 02:19:57.334
[SPEAKER_13]: in a way.

02:19:58.074 --> 02:20:06.022
[SPEAKER_13]: Except I don't think it's a lot of the classic games, but more kind of like the games that are, you know, they're not super old, but they're old enough to not really be selling anymore.

02:20:06.642 --> 02:20:09.505
[SPEAKER_13]: Like Saints Row 2 is unlimited PC play, right?

02:20:10.025 --> 02:20:11.146
[SPEAKER_13]: So there you go.

02:20:13.769 --> 02:20:19.454
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, apparently 2K Games giving everybody who downloads the client a free copy of Bioshock.

02:20:19.775 --> 02:20:21.857
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if that's still going, but it was going for a while.

02:20:21.877 --> 02:20:23.458
[SPEAKER_13]: It probably only was on the launch day.

02:20:23.478 --> 02:20:24.259
[SPEAKER_13]: It's probably done now.

02:20:24.679 --> 02:20:25.059
[SPEAKER_13]: But still.

02:20:26.300 --> 02:20:27.561
[SPEAKER_11]: I could just play that on PS3.

02:20:27.581 --> 02:20:29.082
[SPEAKER_13]: That is true.

02:20:29.242 --> 02:20:32.465
[SPEAKER_13]: Or a lot of folks bought the collection on Steam or what have you.

02:20:33.030 --> 02:20:35.892
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyhow, Xbox 360 USB data storage.

02:20:36.472 --> 02:20:37.953
[SPEAKER_13]: It was capped at 16 gigabytes.

02:20:38.033 --> 02:20:39.714
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if you know that for the USB storage.

02:20:39.734 --> 02:20:43.696
[SPEAKER_13]: They actually raised that in this recent update that happened.

02:20:43.716 --> 02:20:48.198
[SPEAKER_13]: It wasn't really out there, but it has been increased to 32 gigabytes.

02:20:49.158 --> 02:20:52.440
[SPEAKER_13]: So it has been confirmed with Microsoft that this was intentional.

02:20:53.741 --> 02:20:54.321
[SPEAKER_13]: So there you go.

02:20:54.401 --> 02:20:59.604
[SPEAKER_13]: That's great news for those folks that need to make way for data to install their Halo 4.

02:21:00.164 --> 02:21:01.525
[SPEAKER_05]: They should just not have a cap.

02:21:02.285 --> 02:21:09.868
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I understand they want to sell their overly expensive hard drives for these systems, but it shouldn't have a cap.

02:21:10.308 --> 02:21:27.695
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they're just selling these laptop SATA drives and charging a really huge premium on that stuff when I understand you can use external drives to supplement that, but only get 32 gigs of pop, whereas you can get a 2TB drive for half the price of their 320 drive.

02:21:27.715 --> 02:21:28.095
[SPEAKER_05]: So, why even bother?

02:21:33.024 --> 02:21:34.185
[SPEAKER_13]: Tia's Geek Cosplay Fuck

02:21:49.722 --> 02:22:13.156
[SPEAKER_13]: and I love that fuck is all in capital letters with an exclamation point and she dresses up as some of the various characters in Lollipop Chainsaw including like a giant chainsaw and you know she cosplays and it's actually all presumably fucks it's well that is true and it is it's all the same character it's just all of her alternate costumes from the game I see so I've if I remember correctly um

02:22:14.438 --> 02:22:18.779
[SPEAKER_05]: And judging by the back picture here, I don't think she dresses up like anybody else.

02:22:18.879 --> 02:22:25.880
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to tell because the pictures are really small, but I do notice that it's definitely a lot of the alternate costumes.

02:22:26.040 --> 02:22:30.461
[SPEAKER_05]: Although that one might be... No, no, no, that's still... Who cares?

02:22:30.561 --> 02:22:31.641
[SPEAKER_05]: Naked chick dressing up.

02:22:31.782 --> 02:22:32.262
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

02:22:32.582 --> 02:22:33.682
[SPEAKER_05]: She's allowed to make some mistakes.

02:22:33.702 --> 02:22:35.762
[SPEAKER_05]: And she has a giant, really weird-looking chainsaw.

02:22:35.782 --> 02:22:37.263
[SPEAKER_13]: That has a heart at the end of it.

02:22:37.583 --> 02:22:38.943
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's from the game.

02:22:39.543 --> 02:22:41.423
[SPEAKER_13]: So there you go.

02:22:41.523 --> 02:22:43.544
[SPEAKER_13]: That chainsaw just looks really weird.

02:22:43.564 --> 02:22:43.964
[SPEAKER_13]: Cosplay fuck!

02:22:46.693 --> 02:22:47.474
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura.

02:22:47.835 --> 02:22:48.596
[SPEAKER_13]: Try to follow that.

02:22:50.999 --> 02:22:54.283
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I did get FinalFuck10 or X or whatever.

02:22:54.303 --> 02:22:57.447
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember Dance Dance Fuck.

02:22:58.088 --> 02:23:01.813
[SPEAKER_13]: Mental note, ask Eddie about Dance Dance Fuck next time he comes on the show.

02:23:02.734 --> 02:23:10.237
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, a little girl named Maya gets to play Legend of Zelda The Wind Waker as a girl.

02:23:11.097 --> 02:23:21.261
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, her dad is developer Mike Hoy, who basically hex edited the game to replace all of the dialogue to be feminine in regards to Link's gender.

02:23:21.921 --> 02:23:25.344
[SPEAKER_10]: So instead of Swordman, it's Swordmane.

02:23:25.984 --> 02:23:28.086
[SPEAKER_10]: And M'lady instead of my lad and master.

02:23:29.206 --> 02:23:31.908
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's actually put the disc image up that you can play.

02:23:33.069 --> 02:23:34.290
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's pretty neat.

02:23:34.610 --> 02:23:35.711
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's nice.

02:23:35.771 --> 02:23:40.935
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so his daughter can have an adventure that feels more believable to a little girl.

02:23:41.275 --> 02:23:49.361
[SPEAKER_05]: To be fair, he's not actually putting up the disc image because that would be piracy, but he's putting up the patch file that if you find this image with a certain MD5 hash, you can patch it.

02:23:50.313 --> 02:23:51.714
[SPEAKER_05]: Lollipop Chainsaw stars a girl.

02:23:52.155 --> 02:23:52.575
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saying.

02:23:53.496 --> 02:23:54.817
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and the game was also awful.

02:23:55.297 --> 02:23:57.039
[SPEAKER_05]: That game is almost porn as it is.

02:23:57.599 --> 02:24:00.682
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty bad though, but it's just, yeah.

02:24:00.962 --> 02:24:03.904
[SPEAKER_13]: How old will Josh have to be before you let him play Lollipop Chainsaw?

02:24:03.944 --> 02:24:06.707
[SPEAKER_05]: I won't let him play it because it's really terrible.

02:24:07.127 --> 02:24:08.288
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a terrible game.

02:24:08.308 --> 02:24:09.469
[SPEAKER_13]: He doesn't get to play bad games.

02:24:09.529 --> 02:24:16.215
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll be like, dude, listen, if you're going to waste your time on a game, just go on the internet and watch porn because seriously, it's a better use of your time than playing this game.

02:24:16.915 --> 02:24:18.877
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this game is just lame.

02:24:19.217 --> 02:24:19.638
[SPEAKER_10]: Next story.

02:24:19.938 --> 02:24:20.178
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

02:24:20.919 --> 02:24:22.580
[SPEAKER_10]: The Angry Video Game Nerd.

02:24:22.620 --> 02:24:27.725
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, for anyone who's kept up with that Kickstarter, you know, there was Kickstarter to do a movie, and there's a trailer up.

02:24:28.405 --> 02:24:31.448
[SPEAKER_10]: I watched it yesterday, and I was like, really?

02:24:33.270 --> 02:24:33.370
[SPEAKER_10]: Ugh.

02:24:35.071 --> 02:24:36.792
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks like a bad 90s comedy.

02:24:36.872 --> 02:24:38.433
[SPEAKER_10]: I know, I'm going to watch it just for that.

02:24:38.953 --> 02:24:43.435
[SPEAKER_10]: But, I don't know, there were some parts that made me laugh, like the guy going, where the fuck is my arm?

02:24:44.615 --> 02:24:46.096
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that guy from something?

02:24:46.116 --> 02:24:53.639
[SPEAKER_05]: Because he looks like, was it the boss that they had in one of the Mega Man games where he had the tank body type thing?

02:24:53.659 --> 02:24:53.819
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

02:24:55.150 --> 02:24:56.031
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe, I don't know.

02:24:56.551 --> 02:24:59.134
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe he's supposed to be a really screwed up American Dr. Wily.

02:24:59.374 --> 02:25:01.356
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks cheesy like that Gamers movie.

02:25:01.376 --> 02:25:07.623
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember, there's a lot of people who thought that Gamers movie was so awesome and then they made a sequel to it for God knows what reason.

02:25:07.643 --> 02:25:09.264
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably because they made a lot of money off of it.

02:25:10.385 --> 02:25:12.868
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, it's whatever.

02:25:12.908 --> 02:25:13.809
[SPEAKER_05]: It's supposed to be cheesy.

02:25:13.869 --> 02:25:14.510
[SPEAKER_05]: People will buy it.

02:25:15.671 --> 02:25:17.713
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if it's a Kickstarter, he's going to make money from it.

02:25:18.749 --> 02:25:19.469
[SPEAKER_10]: and I'm done

02:25:46.188 --> 02:25:48.501
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, let's get to the Fugle Question of the Week.

02:25:57.108 --> 02:26:01.713
[SPEAKER_13]: Every week we ask a question on our fan communities on Facebook and Google+.

02:26:02.053 --> 02:26:03.575
[SPEAKER_13]: Smoosh them together, you get Foogle.

02:26:04.196 --> 02:26:08.701
[SPEAKER_13]: So here it is, in honor of the fact that we talked a lot about music games tonight.

02:26:09.241 --> 02:26:18.791
[SPEAKER_13]: Our show was born of the music gaming community, but we know we've picked up a variety of listeners since our debut over 10 years ago and our shift to a general gaming show several years ago.

02:26:19.412 --> 02:26:21.633
[SPEAKER_13]: So what is your current thoughts on music gaming?

02:26:22.013 --> 02:26:23.634
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that a genre of game you are into?

02:26:24.054 --> 02:26:28.016
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you think it was a fad that has faded with the rise and fall of Guitar Hero in the States?

02:26:28.256 --> 02:26:29.937
[SPEAKER_13]: Or is the best yet to come?

02:26:30.477 --> 02:26:33.599
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, because our show is running a little long tonight, I'm going to keep this really short.

02:26:33.639 --> 02:26:43.203
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm only going to read a few of these answers, but I really encourage you guys to read the full responses on our Google Plus community, Orange Lounge Radio, and Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

02:26:43.824 --> 02:26:46.485
[SPEAKER_13]: Going to Google Plus, I'm going to read this one from Redertainment.

02:26:47.125 --> 02:26:50.726
[SPEAKER_13]: Like fashion, music, and my exercise group, things run in cycles.

02:26:51.266 --> 02:26:56.228
[SPEAKER_13]: Music gaming will have its comeback, then fizzle out, then comeback, then fizzle out again.

02:26:56.308 --> 02:26:58.448
[SPEAKER_13]: However, ABBA is forever.

02:26:59.449 --> 02:26:59.929
[SPEAKER_13]: Preach.

02:27:00.189 --> 02:27:01.249
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course you like that one.

02:27:01.269 --> 02:27:01.589
[SPEAKER_13]: Preach.

02:27:02.189 --> 02:27:03.250
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course I read that one.

02:27:04.530 --> 02:27:05.951
[SPEAKER_13]: How to get robbed to read your comment.

02:27:06.951 --> 02:27:08.212
[SPEAKER_13]: Nick M replies and said,

02:27:23.559 --> 02:27:30.207
[SPEAKER_13]: Technology, innovations, and creativity will allow music-driven games to make a huge revival, leaving the best to come.

02:27:30.688 --> 02:27:32.850
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are some answers from our Google Plus community.

02:27:32.891 --> 02:27:37.937
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's do a couple from Facebook over at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

02:27:38.638 --> 02:27:39.919
[SPEAKER_13]: Matt J. replied and said...

02:27:40.860 --> 02:27:42.181
[SPEAKER_13]: I love music gaming still.

02:27:42.542 --> 02:27:49.288
[SPEAKER_13]: My rock band library has grown to over 1700 songs and I'm playing almost every day that I can with a close group of friends.

02:27:49.728 --> 02:27:54.072
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been sad to see people leave the community, but I'm still able to find new people I haven't played with.

02:27:54.592 --> 02:28:01.478
[SPEAKER_13]: While my enthusiasm has died down significantly over the years, I'm still very much involved because of the social aspect, even online.

02:28:01.838 --> 02:28:04.581
[SPEAKER_13]: There's such a wonderful but small group of people playing

02:28:04.901 --> 02:28:05.101
[SPEAKER_13]: DJ Melvis

02:28:20.424 --> 02:28:25.630
[SPEAKER_13]: The popularity of music gaming now compared to 10 years ago is nearly night and day.

02:28:26.070 --> 02:28:32.738
[SPEAKER_13]: What propelled the music gaming crowd then was the gamer community who propelled it from a cult following to something mainstream.

02:28:33.238 --> 02:28:38.043
[SPEAKER_13]: Competitive tournaments, video footage of said tourneys, it was something people looked forward to and buzzed about.

02:28:38.544 --> 02:28:44.028
[SPEAKER_13]: Konami, in America, failed to capitalize on that momentum and assumed the fans would eat up anything they put out.

02:28:44.528 --> 02:28:48.070
[SPEAKER_13]: Instead of working with and cultivating their fan base, they turned a blind eye to them.

02:28:48.531 --> 02:28:50.732
[SPEAKER_13]: That ultimately killed a majority of their following.

02:28:50.872 --> 02:28:56.216
[SPEAKER_13]: Combine that with the demise of arcade gaming in America, the tournament scene died and the community grew further apart.

02:28:56.836 --> 02:28:59.398
[SPEAKER_13]: Rock Band is pretty much music gaming's last stand.

02:28:59.978 --> 02:29:06.447
[SPEAKER_13]: At least they nailed the whole microtransaction process with DLC, and events like Umlaut validate its popularity.

02:29:06.868 --> 02:29:08.030
[SPEAKER_13]: Go Harmonix!

02:29:08.450 --> 02:29:11.435
[SPEAKER_13]: Good plug for Umlaut, by the way, which is coming up real soon.

02:29:12.273 --> 02:29:12.893
[SPEAKER_10]: Tell me about it.

02:29:16.115 --> 02:29:16.615
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's see.

02:29:16.795 --> 02:29:18.336
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll do one more here from Facebook.

02:29:18.376 --> 02:29:21.377
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, I'm really sorry I'm limiting this tonight, but we're just running a long night.

02:29:22.117 --> 02:29:24.558
[SPEAKER_13]: Chiggers replies and says, I've been saying the same thing.

02:29:38.104 --> 02:29:56.877
[SPEAKER_13]: I wonder too if they could do something like Trumpet Smith or Sitar Smith I do think they need to somehow incorporate music theory into some of the games though too Sure it's fun to play some of your favorite songs by memory but you can't pick up the guitar and read music and play something that's not on the game For the record there has been Sitar Hero That was a joke though right?

02:29:57.257 --> 02:30:03.421
[SPEAKER_10]: That was on the Austin Powers 3 website as a flash game but it did exist

02:30:04.105 --> 02:30:04.908
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting.

02:30:05.008 --> 02:30:09.000
[SPEAKER_05]: Was it Austin Powers 3 or was it The Love Guru?

02:30:09.060 --> 02:30:11.026
[SPEAKER_10]: It was The Love Guru, that was right, yeah.

02:30:12.313 --> 02:30:13.634
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody forgot about that game.

02:30:13.834 --> 02:30:15.696
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody should forget about that movie.

02:30:16.657 --> 02:30:17.617
[SPEAKER_13]: So there you go.

02:30:18.438 --> 02:30:19.979
[SPEAKER_13]: Quickly, I'll go around the room.

02:30:20.039 --> 02:30:21.901
[SPEAKER_13]: What's your current thoughts on music gaming?

02:30:23.062 --> 02:30:24.623
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it'll always have a niche.

02:30:24.683 --> 02:30:27.686
[SPEAKER_13]: We have to remember it didn't really start with DDR or Beatmania.

02:30:27.866 --> 02:30:29.607
[SPEAKER_13]: It was Dance Aerobics.

02:30:31.008 --> 02:30:40.156
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think games, especially in America, games like Parappa the Rapper, and I know I loved Busta Groove or whatever they called it over here.

02:30:40.578 --> 02:30:41.719
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to totally break that out.

02:30:42.199 --> 02:30:42.399
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

02:30:42.719 --> 02:30:44.080
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I know, but it was a great game.

02:30:44.440 --> 02:30:48.863
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I mean, I kind of feel like there were games before, and there will still be games in the future.

02:30:49.403 --> 02:30:54.567
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it, kind of like that first comment I read, where like, it comes, it goes, it comes, it goes.

02:30:55.127 --> 02:30:57.028
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's kind of how I feel.

02:30:57.188 --> 02:30:58.109
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, DarkSakura?

02:30:58.149 --> 02:31:00.290
[SPEAKER_10]: Now the facts of life theme is stuck in my head.

02:31:00.330 --> 02:31:01.851
[SPEAKER_10]: You take the good, you take the bad.

02:31:02.231 --> 02:31:02.612
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

02:31:03.212 --> 02:31:03.352
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki?

02:31:06.174 --> 02:31:17.123
[SPEAKER_05]: I love music games, so I don't really... I think it's going to just kind of right now coast along with a lot of the dancing franchises with Just Dance and Dance Central and that kind of stuff.

02:31:18.084 --> 02:31:27.391
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe with the new systems, they'll find new ways to kind of incorporate whatever type of peripherals that they have into it, like with the Wii U tablet or something like that.

02:31:27.411 --> 02:31:28.252
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

02:31:29.853 --> 02:31:47.602
[SPEAKER_05]: I just, you know, I hope it doesn't, I assume it's just going to keep, you know, staying around for a while because you still have, you know, a niche audience that's really into it and sometimes that's all it takes is just a niche audience because, I mean, look at a lot of the Atlas products and stuff like that that don't sell millions of copies and you have dozens and dozens of sequels.

02:31:49.989 --> 02:31:55.531
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, let's move on with some more news, and then we'll get to the mailbag and some quick calls tonight.

02:31:55.751 --> 02:31:56.792
[SPEAKER_13]: So, Loki.

02:31:57.392 --> 02:31:57.712
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

02:31:58.252 --> 02:32:03.715
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk a little bit about some really weird patents.

02:32:04.195 --> 02:32:19.461
[SPEAKER_05]: And Microsoft has one now that it's basically this kind of DRM system that's going to use a Kinect-like camera to basically monitor the number of users that are watching a display of a certain performance or content or whatever.

02:32:20.462 --> 02:32:28.699
[SPEAKER_05]: and basically tracking the faces of those viewers to see if they have appropriately licensed it.

02:32:28.779 --> 02:32:29.561
[SPEAKER_05]: So, for example...

02:32:31.385 --> 02:32:48.463
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it sounds kind of stupid, but let's say I rented a movie or something like that, and then I have to go to the bathroom, and I leave that the movie would stop or something because I'm no longer in the room, and it's like, oh, shit, the person that registered this content is no longer in the room.

02:32:48.944 --> 02:32:51.126
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that sounds a little ridiculous, but

02:32:53.247 --> 02:32:56.008
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if this is necessarily going to be something that they do.

02:32:56.028 --> 02:33:01.849
[SPEAKER_05]: It mentions, I guess, gaming and gaming media, also mobile devices.

02:33:02.749 --> 02:33:17.413
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe my thought is that it's like your computer will lock... I mean, they have it right now already with some of those biometric sensors and stuff, but maybe it's something where your computer will lock down if it doesn't recognize you.

02:33:17.833 --> 02:33:20.734
[SPEAKER_05]: Although, that's going to suck if you get in a car accident and your face gets disfigured, but...

02:33:22.195 --> 02:33:28.139
[SPEAKER_13]: Or, you know, I know a lot of the live listeners are complaining that the OLR feed is going up What did they say?

02:33:28.760 --> 02:33:46.333
[SPEAKER_13]: Ragenator said, OLR is going down faster and more frequently than White House interns when Clinton was in office Well, you know, I like to grow and shave a beard pretty frequently as well I like having a beard, but then I'll shave it when I have to do Rocky or something An onstage part that requires me to shave it

02:33:46.693 --> 02:33:50.137
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, how's the Kinect going to pick that up?

02:33:50.157 --> 02:33:50.698
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me put it this way.

02:33:50.778 --> 02:33:52.120
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not that sophisticated.

02:33:52.140 --> 02:33:58.588
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically looking at facial geometry, like, you know, the proportions between, you know, space between your eyes.

02:33:58.608 --> 02:34:01.131
[SPEAKER_05]: So the, you know, bone structure and that kind of stuff.

02:34:01.171 --> 02:34:04.435
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, okay, your face is this wide, your eyes are this far apart.

02:34:04.475 --> 02:34:05.917
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, but that technology is not going to work.

02:34:06.397 --> 02:34:07.117
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the problem.

02:34:08.138 --> 02:34:12.520
[SPEAKER_13]: The Kinect was supposed to do all this stuff and it doesn't really work in the real world.

02:34:12.600 --> 02:34:23.485
[SPEAKER_05]: And who really likes signing into Xbox Live by staring at the Kinect for like 30 seconds or hitting A and signing in right away?

02:34:23.965 --> 02:34:29.508
[SPEAKER_13]: I really hope this technology is only being patented to harness it so that nobody can ever use it.

02:34:30.288 --> 02:34:31.849
[SPEAKER_13]: That is my real true hope.

02:34:32.009 --> 02:34:33.270
[SPEAKER_13]: But I'm not going to hold my breath.

02:34:35.959 --> 02:34:36.359
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see.

02:34:38.341 --> 02:34:43.204
[SPEAKER_13]: We had news earlier in the year that Nintendo Power was going to be having its last issue ever.

02:34:43.464 --> 02:34:44.785
[SPEAKER_13]: And guess what?

02:34:45.285 --> 02:34:48.367
[SPEAKER_13]: PlayStation, the official magazine, following right behind.

02:34:48.728 --> 02:34:55.012
[SPEAKER_13]: The holiday 2012 issue will be the last issue of the official, or excuse me, PlayStation, the official magazine.

02:34:56.333 --> 02:35:01.876
[SPEAKER_13]: That is not long after Future US, who also published Nintendo Power, announced that shutdown.

02:35:02.317 --> 02:35:04.898
[SPEAKER_13]: So, bye-bye, magazines.

02:35:05.939 --> 02:35:06.820
[SPEAKER_13]: Going bye-bye.

02:35:07.320 --> 02:35:08.821
[SPEAKER_13]: There's two out the door.

02:35:10.042 --> 02:35:15.387
[SPEAKER_13]: It's unfortunate we don't have like a iPad version of it or something that lives on.

02:35:15.467 --> 02:35:16.107
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

02:35:16.468 --> 02:35:16.748
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe.

02:35:17.208 --> 02:35:21.672
[SPEAKER_11]: It makes me very depressed because print is beautiful and ink smells good.

02:35:22.152 --> 02:35:25.835
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, but well, what do you think can be done to save this dying industry?

02:35:25.855 --> 02:35:26.936
[SPEAKER_10]: We still have play, don't we?

02:35:28.396 --> 02:35:29.077
[SPEAKER_13]: I think so.

02:35:29.237 --> 02:35:30.398
[SPEAKER_10]: I love that magazine.

02:35:30.799 --> 02:35:31.800
[SPEAKER_10]: Play better not go anywhere.

02:35:32.521 --> 02:35:39.368
[SPEAKER_13]: But what would, I mean, do you think this is something that could make a renaissance someday?

02:35:39.489 --> 02:35:41.511
[SPEAKER_13]: Or is this just done because of technology?

02:35:41.531 --> 02:35:42.512
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we get EGM again, right?

02:35:43.073 --> 02:35:44.694
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

02:35:44.775 --> 02:35:46.336
[SPEAKER_13]: Is this just done because of tablets?

02:35:46.456 --> 02:35:47.738
[SPEAKER_13]: I know you don't like to think about it, but...

02:35:49.136 --> 02:35:49.737
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a shift.

02:35:49.837 --> 02:35:52.760
[SPEAKER_13]: Somebody's gotta design the tablet document if we go there.

02:36:09.235 --> 02:36:09.975
[SPEAKER_10]: Speak for yourself.

02:36:33.567 --> 02:36:40.331
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here's something like, you know, the whole shift from digital or from print to digital.

02:36:40.431 --> 02:36:42.452
[SPEAKER_05]: Game Informer has a digital version.

02:36:43.232 --> 02:36:46.594
[SPEAKER_05]: How did they get me to switch over to the digital version from print?

02:36:47.935 --> 02:36:53.158
[SPEAKER_05]: The Grand Theft Auto information came out this week on the digital version and two weeks later on print.

02:36:53.378 --> 02:36:55.279
[SPEAKER_05]: So I went, I want the digital version.

02:36:56.740 --> 02:36:57.920
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's what it is.

02:36:57.940 --> 02:36:58.701
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter.

02:36:58.721 --> 02:37:00.942
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, I thumbed through it once and then I put it aside.

02:37:01.042 --> 02:37:02.823
[SPEAKER_05]: So and then I throw them away months later.

02:37:03.303 --> 02:37:04.464
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki brings up a good point.

02:37:04.584 --> 02:37:11.430
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it that need-to-know-right-now mentality, especially in the gaming culture, that might be hurting magazines a little bit?

02:37:11.450 --> 02:37:12.091
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah.

02:37:12.151 --> 02:37:12.932
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's the thing, too.

02:37:12.972 --> 02:37:13.913
[SPEAKER_05]: It probably doesn't help.

02:37:14.093 --> 02:37:18.176
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that, you know, all that Grand Theft Auto information, immediately, as soon as it hit...

02:37:19.157 --> 02:37:25.720
[SPEAKER_05]: The digital version, it hit the NeoGAF forums and then it hit all the blogs and it hit all the websites.

02:37:25.920 --> 02:37:32.524
[SPEAKER_05]: So even if you didn't subscribe to that magazine, unless you wanted to read the article by yourself, you got all the information that was right there.

02:37:33.564 --> 02:37:36.005
[SPEAKER_05]: To wait for it to be in print is just ridiculous.

02:37:36.165 --> 02:37:36.906
[SPEAKER_05]: Why would you do that?

02:37:37.966 --> 02:37:41.787
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, other than appreciating the art of printing and all that stuff.

02:37:42.348 --> 02:37:43.828
[SPEAKER_05]: And pretty pictures to look at.

02:37:43.988 --> 02:37:50.731
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's nothing, now that you have digital versions, there's really nothing that's exclusive anymore to them, momentarily at least.

02:37:53.124 --> 02:38:00.109
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell, let's be honest, it took them a day or two to get my digital version converted over.

02:38:01.149 --> 02:38:10.895
[SPEAKER_05]: I looked at screen caps because you can do screen caps on your iPod or iPhone or on your iPad and I looked at screen caps of the whole articles.

02:38:11.035 --> 02:38:13.977
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't even need the digital version to read that stuff.

02:38:16.038 --> 02:38:17.019
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's kind of...

02:38:19.676 --> 02:38:20.116
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:38:39.568 --> 02:38:48.630
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this is, as soon as it works, this is an old format that had a game released in 2010.

02:38:50.171 --> 02:38:51.751
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you ever heard of Pure Solar?

02:38:52.991 --> 02:38:57.052
[SPEAKER_10]: It was released in 2010 for the Sega Mega Drive, or as we know it, the Genesis.

02:38:58.033 --> 02:39:01.934
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's like a 64 megabyte cartridge.

02:39:02.034 --> 02:39:03.294
[SPEAKER_10]: It was huge.

02:39:04.474 --> 02:39:06.075
[SPEAKER_10]: It was very well received.

02:39:06.616 --> 02:39:18.523
[SPEAKER_10]: Now the group Watermelon, the developer, has a Kickstarter to release an HD version to come out for Xbox 360, PC, Mac, Linux, and Dreamcast.

02:39:18.643 --> 02:39:23.906
[SPEAKER_10]: The game already has over 50 hours of gameplay, 300 locations, and 800 NPCs.

02:39:26.207 --> 02:39:31.771
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually watched the little interview on here and it looks pretty neat.

02:39:32.952 --> 02:39:46.963
[SPEAKER_10]: If you pledge $15 you'll receive a copy of the game when it's released for whatever platform you wish and $45 get a limited edition 4 CD copy of the soundtrack or a digital bundle consisting of the game

02:39:47.883 --> 02:39:54.985
[SPEAKER_10]: on Xbox 360, PC, Mac, Linux, one of the three, as well as a digital copy of the soundtrack.

02:39:55.025 --> 02:39:56.545
[SPEAKER_10]: There's also a limited edition for $125.

02:39:56.585 --> 02:40:09.028
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a hard copy of the game for either Dreamcast or PC, Mac, Linux, and the Pierce Solar Guidebook signed lithograph and three figurines.

02:40:09.568 --> 02:40:22.015
[SPEAKER_10]: there's only going to be 250 of them produced and as of when I was reading this there were just under 100 pre-ordered this actually might be the first one I put money into the game looks awesome

02:40:26.144 --> 02:40:38.373
[SPEAKER_10]: and there were the $999 Kickstarter exclusive Dreamcast ones have already been ordered.

02:40:38.453 --> 02:40:42.296
[SPEAKER_10]: So they are currently at $76,468 out of their $139,000 goal and they have 26 days to go.

02:40:42.316 --> 02:40:43.697
[SPEAKER_10]: So I want this and I think everyone should check it out.

02:40:43.717 --> 02:40:43.797
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

02:40:53.505 --> 02:40:57.010
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, just a few more stories then we'll get to the mailbag and the FUs of the week

02:41:01.167 --> 02:41:16.737
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, so I think we talked about this before, but there was some whole controversy about the Navy SEALs actually helping the developers of Medal of Honor Warfighter with some of the details of the game and stuff like that.

02:41:17.537 --> 02:41:28.904
[SPEAKER_05]: And it probably doesn't help that they have the whole DLC tying in with that movie Zero Dark Thirty, which is about the whole SEAL Team Six infiltrating Osama Bin Laden's camp and stuff like that.

02:41:30.760 --> 02:41:43.237
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyways, apparently seven SEALs so far have received letters of reprimand, effectively denying them of promotion and also docking them half of their salaries for two months.

02:41:45.880 --> 02:42:11.837
[SPEAKER_05]: which you know obviously they're probably getting paid by EA anyways but um but yeah so that's I don't know I guess four of the seven are affected are still engaging in active duty and are still under investigation but um that kind of sucks but then again if you're in the military and you're revealing military secrets to a game company it's kind of a problem

02:42:16.010 --> 02:42:16.330
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, right.

02:42:44.721 --> 02:42:50.085
[SPEAKER_13]: How historically accurate is too historically accurate, especially when it's so recent, you know?

02:42:51.526 --> 02:42:53.787
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, moving on to something completely different.

02:42:54.187 --> 02:42:57.710
[SPEAKER_13]: Capcom is apparently going to be hiring 1,000 people.

02:42:57.750 --> 02:42:59.231
[SPEAKER_13]: That's pretty cool.

02:42:59.511 --> 02:43:05.575
[SPEAKER_13]: 1,000 people over the course of 10 years, but that would be adding to the 1,500 game developers that are on staff currently.

02:43:06.495 --> 02:43:13.400
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a Capcom representative saying, quote, "...we want to further improve the quality of our games by maintaining an internal game development team."

02:43:14.460 --> 02:43:19.183
[SPEAKER_13]: The purpose of increasing our game developer team is to create a larger percentage of our games internally.

02:43:19.644 --> 02:43:28.109
[SPEAKER_13]: Therefore, we believe that there will be no significant change in total development expenditures, mainly because we will be shifting outsourced operations to our own workforce.

02:43:28.749 --> 02:43:34.493
[SPEAKER_13]: That's pretty neat because there's a lot of that outsourcing that goes on in the gaming industry as well.

02:43:34.573 --> 02:43:41.037
[SPEAKER_13]: For all the Capcom is evil chats that go on, and certainly they've made some pretty shitty decisions over the past couple of years, let's be real.

02:43:42.378 --> 02:43:46.580
[SPEAKER_13]: This is pretty cool that they are going to be bringing a lot of jobs back.

02:43:47.721 --> 02:43:50.803
[SPEAKER_13]: Do notice, though, that that doesn't necessarily mean it's a thousand jobs here.

02:43:51.023 --> 02:43:52.624
[SPEAKER_13]: It's probably a thousand jobs in Japan.

02:43:53.044 --> 02:44:01.889
[SPEAKER_13]: But, you know, still more internally developed games, I think, means they can kind of keep a closer eye on things and hopefully get some better products.

02:44:01.969 --> 02:44:02.409
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll see.

02:44:04.551 --> 02:44:04.971
[SPEAKER_13]: Interesting.

02:44:06.966 --> 02:44:36.358
[SPEAKER_13]: so Capcom sounds like they're almost it's almost double but not quite so alright well let's get to our mailbag segment every week you guys send us emails mailbag at orange lounge radio dot com and we read some of our favorites here on the air DarkSakura why don't you dive into the mailbag head first and read some emails for us just three just three first of all this one's a little long but I'll try to get through it quickly

02:44:36.803 --> 02:44:38.364
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey OLR, AZHP here.

02:44:38.444 --> 02:44:43.907
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard you guys talk about Rhode Island suing 38 Studios for $75 million, basically assuming that Rhode Island was in the right for a lawsuit.

02:44:44.527 --> 02:44:47.749
[SPEAKER_10]: It seemed like there were some assumptions being made, so I wanted to clear up some misconceptions.

02:44:48.229 --> 02:44:52.171
[SPEAKER_10]: The lawsuit is not as straightforward as 38 Studios didn't put out a game and we want our money.

02:44:52.911 --> 02:44:58.054
[SPEAKER_10]: 38 Studios declared bankruptcy, which typically prevents a company from being pursued by creditors, in this case the state of Rhode Island.

02:44:58.434 --> 02:45:05.836
[SPEAKER_10]: However, Rhode Island's suit claims that 38 Studios and Kirch Schilling misled Rhode Island as to the difficulties involved with putting out an MMO.

02:45:06.196 --> 02:45:10.457
[SPEAKER_10]: And because Rhode Island was misled, $75 million was loaned in poor trust and should be repaid.

02:45:11.237 --> 02:45:13.018
[SPEAKER_10]: There's another misconception I wanted to clear up.

02:45:13.198 --> 02:45:22.180
[SPEAKER_10]: Rhode Island approached 38 Studios promising the $75 million loan and tax breaks if 38 Studios would move their operation to Rhode Island in the first place.

02:45:22.460 --> 02:45:24.681
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, they wanted 38 Studios to come to Rhode Island.

02:45:25.541 --> 02:45:39.919
[SPEAKER_10]: This is basically like a bank saying, hey, we'll give you a good deal on a loan to buy a house, lending you the money, you losing your job, going bankrupt and foreclosing due to unforeseen circumstances, and the bank saying, whoa, whoa, whoa, you didn't tell me there was a possibility you would lose your job, we want our money back, and we're going to take your house.

02:45:41.537 --> 02:45:45.298
[SPEAKER_10]: As you guys can see, it's not as clear cut that Rhode Island deserves any money at all.

02:45:45.759 --> 02:45:49.640
[SPEAKER_10]: If you make an investment and it doesn't pay off, in my opinion, you should go suck it up and take your lumps.

02:45:50.060 --> 02:45:51.941
[SPEAKER_10]: But try telling that to the governor of Rhode Island.

02:45:51.981 --> 02:45:55.662
[SPEAKER_10]: Just my two cents on the matter is HPOLR's premier gold star recipient.

02:45:56.435 --> 02:46:04.082
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's a good point that he brings up, is that Rhode Island did... I thought we kind of touched on this a little bit last week, and I'm going to say it again now.

02:46:05.343 --> 02:46:08.666
[SPEAKER_13]: Why was it so goddamn important that they get this guy in the first place?

02:46:09.367 --> 02:46:17.354
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember, I mentioned last week, were we blinded by our sports culture, where we hold these sportsmen that do so well in such high regard...

02:46:19.095 --> 02:46:21.676
[SPEAKER_13]: Was that really Rhode Island's mistake, possibly?

02:46:22.016 --> 02:46:25.656
[SPEAKER_13]: And yeah, if that was their mistake, then they in turn need to pay for that.

02:46:26.276 --> 02:46:26.957
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I don't know.

02:46:27.037 --> 02:46:35.598
[SPEAKER_13]: But like some of our chatters were saying last week, you know, I say all this, you know, and I know it sounds really cold and really mean and that I'm like anti-sport.

02:46:35.778 --> 02:46:36.138
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not.

02:46:36.238 --> 02:46:37.219
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not any of those things.

02:46:37.339 --> 02:46:37.879
[SPEAKER_13]: I am.

02:46:37.899 --> 02:46:38.599
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm kidding.

02:46:39.099 --> 02:46:44.200
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think Curt Schilling and all them meant well, but...

02:46:46.342 --> 02:46:48.265
[SPEAKER_13]: I would like to do a lot of things.

02:46:48.305 --> 02:46:53.273
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you going to give me $75 million because I mean well and I have good intentions and some real good ideas?

02:46:55.156 --> 02:46:55.857
[SPEAKER_13]: Probably not.

02:46:56.858 --> 02:46:58.461
[SPEAKER_13]: You're going to expect to see some things.

02:46:59.021 --> 02:46:59.582
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I just...

02:47:01.496 --> 02:47:04.738
[SPEAKER_13]: Persona 4 Arena will not make it to Europe this year.

02:47:24.873 --> 02:47:25.734
[SPEAKER_13]: I heard about that.

02:47:25.774 --> 02:47:28.717
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys got screwed because that's the region locked one, huh?

02:47:29.377 --> 02:47:30.318
[SPEAKER_13]: That is so messed up.

02:47:30.358 --> 02:47:32.700
[SPEAKER_10]: And people wondered why we bitched about it being region locked.

02:47:32.881 --> 02:47:41.528
[SPEAKER_10]: As a pretty big Shin Megami Tensei fan, I was really looking forward to this game and we still have no idea when it will be released, only that it won't be this year.

02:47:41.669 --> 02:47:41.989
[SPEAKER_10]: Sigh.

02:47:44.371 --> 02:47:44.892
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, bless you.

02:47:45.372 --> 02:47:46.353
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys got hosed.

02:47:47.294 --> 02:47:48.395
[SPEAKER_13]: That's really unfortunate.

02:47:50.427 --> 02:47:55.929
[SPEAKER_13]: I really don't know what else to say except that, you know, I wouldn't fault you for pirating it at that point.

02:47:57.030 --> 02:47:58.470
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not supposed to encourage that.

02:47:58.590 --> 02:48:00.631
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't really if it's region locked.

02:48:00.971 --> 02:48:01.631
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you can.

02:48:01.711 --> 02:48:04.913
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you suggesting that people can't work around that?

02:48:05.253 --> 02:48:10.555
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you can, but you need a JTAG system on Xbox 360 or a recent glitch hack system.

02:48:10.595 --> 02:48:11.475
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I thought.

02:48:13.436 --> 02:48:16.277
[SPEAKER_10]: And the last email comes from your boyfriend.

02:48:18.362 --> 02:48:19.022
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki's boyfriend?

02:48:19.203 --> 02:48:19.243
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

02:48:19.283 --> 02:48:19.643
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just kidding.

02:48:21.104 --> 02:48:21.704
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Loki's boyfriend.

02:48:21.724 --> 02:48:22.745
[SPEAKER_13]: Come on, that was too easy.

02:48:22.765 --> 02:48:23.645
[SPEAKER_13]: That was too easy.

02:48:23.826 --> 02:48:24.106
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, yes.

02:48:24.126 --> 02:48:25.106
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Loki's boyfriend.

02:48:25.267 --> 02:48:25.607
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

02:48:25.647 --> 02:48:25.927
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, Alan.

02:48:25.947 --> 02:48:26.707
[SPEAKER_13]: I have no boyfriends.

02:48:26.848 --> 02:48:27.448
[SPEAKER_13]: I know you don't.

02:48:27.508 --> 02:48:29.849
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, Alan.

02:48:29.910 --> 02:48:32.831
[SPEAKER_10]: This question is for DarkSakura, and it's related to Mass Effect 2, my favorite.

02:48:34.172 --> 02:48:47.607
[SPEAKER_10]: The upcoming Omega DLC looks pretty rad, but starting with ME3 proper, Bioware made some really glaring weird sexist mistakes with both InfemShep's handling, as well as her relationship, soiling Caden for a lot of shippers who don't give a fuck about dudeship.

02:48:48.067 --> 02:48:48.588
[SPEAKER_10]: Me included.

02:48:50.427 --> 02:48:57.755
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks to this, many in the fandom have joked that the female versions of Mass Effect aliens will end up being maleface plus bad perm plus stocked to its armor.

02:48:59.337 --> 02:49:11.129
[SPEAKER_10]: My question is, how do you feel about Nareen having proper separated breasts in screenshots instead of just a larger breastplate region in her robe, considering that Turians are clearly supposed to be avian, reptilian, or both?

02:49:11.830 --> 02:49:14.712
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not asking if you're offended personally, though if you are, let it out.

02:49:15.292 --> 02:49:19.916
[SPEAKER_10]: But from a design perspective, since they otherwise did a good job on her face and head detailing.

02:49:20.316 --> 02:49:21.096
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's from Ellen.

02:49:22.857 --> 02:49:24.659
[SPEAKER_10]: First of all, I actually didn't notice she had boobs.

02:49:25.439 --> 02:49:27.000
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought she just had plating.

02:49:28.021 --> 02:49:31.263
[SPEAKER_10]: Or maybe like a kind of segmented chest plate type of thing.

02:49:32.084 --> 02:49:38.288
[SPEAKER_10]: Because, and I didn't even really think to look, because of cut dialogue in Mass Effect 2.

02:49:39.308 --> 02:49:40.990
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's what I linked to earlier.

02:49:42.551 --> 02:49:43.232
[SPEAKER_10]: Did I want it to play?

02:49:44.273 --> 02:49:44.873
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah, sure.

02:49:45.774 --> 02:49:47.936
[SPEAKER_10]: You're looking at me like, what?

02:49:48.817 --> 02:49:49.738
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, keep talking.

02:49:50.038 --> 02:49:51.260
[SPEAKER_13]: Hold on, what am I playing here?

02:49:51.600 --> 02:49:55.264
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the groundskeeper on the Citadel in Mass Effect 2.

02:49:58.988 --> 02:49:59.948
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, human.

02:50:00.449 --> 02:50:01.469
[SPEAKER_06]: It is evening, isn't it?

02:50:02.009 --> 02:50:04.330
[SPEAKER_06]: Without day and night, I lose track.

02:50:04.731 --> 02:50:06.771
[SPEAKER_06]: I shipped in from Palavin last month.

02:50:07.112 --> 02:50:08.412
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still getting my bearings.

02:50:08.812 --> 02:50:12.594
[SPEAKER_06]: You'd be surprised how much a trained horticulturalist can earn here.

02:50:12.954 --> 02:50:16.656
[SPEAKER_06]: The nicest thing about being on the Citadel has to be the drinks.

02:50:17.176 --> 02:50:21.781
[SPEAKER_06]: You might not believe it, but my species hasn't invented many intoxicants.

02:50:22.241 --> 02:50:27.066
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm constantly amazed by human creativity when it comes to brewing and distilling.

02:50:27.087 --> 02:50:29.529
[SPEAKER_06]: You ever had aquarium thruster fuel?

02:50:29.970 --> 02:50:32.012
[SPEAKER_06]: Must be 99% alcohol.

02:50:32.452 --> 02:50:34.915
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they distill it from raw antimatter.

02:50:35.535 --> 02:50:37.097
[SPEAKER_06]: Antimatter alcohol.

02:50:37.477 --> 02:50:38.759
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me for asking, but...

02:50:39.179 --> 02:50:40.500
[SPEAKER_06]: You're a female, right?

02:50:41.080 --> 02:50:43.742
[SPEAKER_06]: You got those funny bumps, like an Asari.

02:50:44.122 --> 02:50:47.144
[SPEAKER_06]: Every time I come in here, some Asari asks me to dance.

02:50:47.545 --> 02:50:49.546
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, Turians don't dance.

02:50:50.026 --> 02:50:53.669
[SPEAKER_06]: Second of all, Asari have those funny bumps that get in the way.

02:50:54.849 --> 02:50:56.370
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what I'm trying to get to.

02:50:58.391 --> 02:50:59.671
[SPEAKER_10]: That was cut dialogue.

02:51:00.131 --> 02:51:05.234
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, you know where you go talk to him after the croak and ask if there's fish in the reservoir?

02:51:05.674 --> 02:51:07.254
[SPEAKER_10]: That was cut dialogue from him.

02:51:07.615 --> 02:51:09.615
[SPEAKER_13]: You got some funny bumps, DarkSakura.

02:51:09.795 --> 02:51:10.396
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up.

02:51:10.416 --> 02:51:13.297
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are some big bumps.

02:51:14.777 --> 02:51:15.318
[SPEAKER_10]: Shut up.

02:51:17.045 --> 02:51:19.766
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I actually did have a kitten stand on my boobs yesterday.

02:51:20.206 --> 02:51:20.587
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you?

02:51:21.087 --> 02:51:24.948
[SPEAKER_10]: My friend drugged me to PetSmart and I was close to throwing down 60 bucks for this kitten.

02:51:24.988 --> 02:51:28.570
[SPEAKER_10]: He goes, this reminds me of Shermie, but that wouldn't be fair to Shermie's memory.

02:51:28.970 --> 02:51:31.111
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, the kitten passed the standing on boobs test.

02:51:31.789 --> 02:51:33.831
[SPEAKER_10]: Just stood there and then curled up and purred.

02:51:34.012 --> 02:51:35.193
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, okay, I have to hold you.

02:51:35.773 --> 02:51:37.435
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, back to Mass Effect.

02:51:39.037 --> 02:51:40.238
[SPEAKER_10]: So I actually didn't even look.

02:51:40.299 --> 02:51:42.981
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have some of the comics.

02:51:43.082 --> 02:51:50.870
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't read some of... I looked at pictures of what the female Turians looked like in some of those comics.

02:51:51.091 --> 02:51:52.012
[SPEAKER_10]: And I had the...

02:51:54.013 --> 02:51:54.734
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, oh my god.

02:51:56.015 --> 02:52:00.921
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry for... She doesn't look like super endowed.

02:52:01.061 --> 02:52:05.246
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not like overly sexualized, I think, is important to keep in mind.

02:52:05.306 --> 02:52:07.088
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not like she's got some tiggle bitties.

02:52:07.528 --> 02:52:09.591
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it's just like, okay, she's got some funny bumps.

02:52:10.071 --> 02:52:10.671
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it.

02:52:10.711 --> 02:52:11.571
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's not nothing.

02:52:11.971 --> 02:52:12.691
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like it.

02:52:12.872 --> 02:52:16.952
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, they kind of look flattish, like more like an extended rib cage.

02:52:17.552 --> 02:52:17.772
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

02:52:18.253 --> 02:52:22.533
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I mean, in general, I think Turian rib cage is supposed to be really high if you ever looked at the naked model.

02:52:22.593 --> 02:52:24.454
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a fucking alien race.

02:52:24.534 --> 02:52:29.455
[SPEAKER_13]: Why are we so, like in a fake video game, it's a fake alien race.

02:52:29.495 --> 02:52:32.215
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, why are we so like, oh, but it's not lizard accurate.

02:52:32.255 --> 02:52:33.895
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's not a fucking lizard.

02:52:33.915 --> 02:52:36.196
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are the worst breasts I've seen on a lizard yet.

02:52:37.316 --> 02:52:43.601
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I mean, my point was it's not something I noticed because, first of all, I didn't really see evidence of it in the comics.

02:52:44.462 --> 02:52:46.043
[SPEAKER_10]: And there was that cut dialogue.

02:52:46.143 --> 02:52:47.664
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't think to look for boobs.

02:52:48.325 --> 02:52:51.447
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I was like, okay, Turian chicks don't have boobs.

02:52:51.547 --> 02:52:52.548
[SPEAKER_10]: Good for them.

02:52:52.708 --> 02:52:55.210
[SPEAKER_10]: They probably regurgitate to feed their young.

02:52:55.690 --> 02:52:58.893
[SPEAKER_10]: If they're based off of birds or lizards, then that's kind of gross, but...

02:52:59.415 --> 02:53:05.939
[SPEAKER_13]: Alan is in our chat room right now and says, it's more of an issue that they are hard and rough and scaly, but suddenly soft jubilees.

02:53:06.460 --> 02:53:09.201
[SPEAKER_13]: How do you know those aren't some rough, scaly boobs?

02:53:09.321 --> 02:53:13.124
[SPEAKER_13]: How do you know they're not all like... How do you know those aren't the slimiest tits you'll ever see?

02:53:13.164 --> 02:53:14.845
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember Morden and his chafing?

02:53:15.706 --> 02:53:17.046
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll prescribe analgesics.

02:53:17.347 --> 02:53:18.087
[SPEAKER_10]: May cause chafing.

02:53:19.048 --> 02:53:26.513
[SPEAKER_10]: But... But... I think that it's not so much of a big deal.

02:53:26.633 --> 02:53:26.993
[SPEAKER_10]: I think...

02:53:28.962 --> 02:53:34.245
[SPEAKER_10]: I may feel differently when I actually play it and see them in action, see if they bounce.

02:53:34.866 --> 02:53:37.247
[SPEAKER_10]: But it didn't look like boob boobs, you know?

02:53:37.647 --> 02:53:40.769
[SPEAKER_10]: It just looked like a hint of boob.

02:53:40.909 --> 02:53:42.510
[SPEAKER_13]: Alan in chat is apologizing.

02:53:42.590 --> 02:53:43.471
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry I asked.

02:53:43.531 --> 02:53:44.551
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought it was interesting.

02:53:44.611 --> 02:53:45.792
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it is.

02:53:45.892 --> 02:53:47.173
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm yelling at the internet.

02:53:47.213 --> 02:53:48.514
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not yelling at you.

02:53:48.654 --> 02:53:49.574
[SPEAKER_13]: I would never yell at you.

02:53:49.675 --> 02:53:52.696
[SPEAKER_10]: I cannot wait, by the way, to play through Omega with FemShep.

02:53:53.557 --> 02:53:55.038
[SPEAKER_10]: With Team Badass Bitch.

02:53:56.038 --> 02:53:56.799
[SPEAKER_10]: Because Aria...

02:53:57.639 --> 02:54:20.468
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't fuck with Arya Yeah, Omega has one rule Don't fuck with Arya That's my rule too Don't fuck with me Good times Yeah, and Tigerclaw is right Javik did call Salarians lizard people And also said that Raw Salarian liver is a delicacy And that they used to eat flies

02:54:21.249 --> 02:54:23.111
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, let's get... Is that it for emails?

02:54:23.531 --> 02:54:23.991
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, it is.

02:54:24.131 --> 02:54:25.813
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's get to the FUs of the week.

02:54:25.913 --> 02:54:28.375
[SPEAKER_13]: Every week we rant on this show because we can.

02:54:47.197 --> 02:54:57.242
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a huge FU that goes to a condition called angular chelitis, which some people can use for cold sores or canker sores.

02:54:57.362 --> 02:55:04.965
[SPEAKER_10]: What they are is when you get a lesion in the corner of your mouth that forms kind of a pussy scab, and it happens to lots of people.

02:55:05.345 --> 02:55:08.527
[SPEAKER_10]: But the thing that I hate about it, I mean, you know, yeah, this happened.

02:55:08.607 --> 02:55:13.149
[SPEAKER_10]: It happens from a vitamin deficiency and basically a lot of stress.

02:55:13.949 --> 02:55:21.561
[SPEAKER_10]: But what I hate is waking up in the morning and having to yawn and forgetting all about it and then just it hurt really bad.

02:55:21.961 --> 02:55:24.625
[SPEAKER_10]: And also drivers in the parking lot at Whole Foods.

02:55:25.446 --> 02:55:26.748
[SPEAKER_10]: Screw all of you entitled rich people.

02:55:28.436 --> 02:55:30.938
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, fuck you to Ford in my car.

02:55:31.538 --> 02:55:34.961
[SPEAKER_05]: He's breaking.

02:55:35.041 --> 02:55:51.692
[SPEAKER_05]: Last time I took it in to get repaired, which was about $1,200 for repairs, I think, with a bunch of stuff, and then it broke down a month later, the guy there, who had this really weird growth on his face, said, oh yeah, I've seen those cars last for 300,000 miles.

02:55:51.892 --> 02:55:54.975
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, after you replace every goddamn part in the car,

02:55:56.035 --> 02:55:57.016
[SPEAKER_05]: Four times!

02:55:57.756 --> 02:55:59.137
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably lasted that long.

02:55:59.197 --> 02:56:01.939
[SPEAKER_05]: But then again, it's not the original car anymore, now is it?

02:56:03.199 --> 02:56:03.539
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

02:56:04.640 --> 02:56:07.301
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want to know my FU of the week, refer to the top of the show.

02:56:08.062 --> 02:56:09.303
[SPEAKER_13]: It was kind of a shitty weekend.

02:56:09.843 --> 02:56:11.444
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to go back to work tomorrow.

02:56:13.905 --> 02:56:14.846
[SPEAKER_13]: But I guess we have to make money.

02:56:15.766 --> 02:56:17.968
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, a couple more news stories for you guys.

02:56:17.988 --> 02:56:21.532
[SPEAKER_13]: Then we'll open up the Skype line quickly at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:56:21.552 --> 02:56:22.373
[SPEAKER_13]: I emphasize quickly.

02:56:22.393 --> 02:56:25.836
[SPEAKER_13]: We might only do one or two calls tonight, depending on who all tries to get in.

02:56:26.697 --> 02:56:27.618
[SPEAKER_13]: And of course, Twitter topics.

02:56:27.638 --> 02:56:28.879
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll get through as many of those as we can.

02:56:28.919 --> 02:56:30.101
[SPEAKER_13]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

02:56:30.241 --> 02:56:30.481
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki.

02:56:31.142 --> 02:56:36.507
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Silicon Knights, you remember they were suing Epic Games over the whole, you know...

02:56:37.160 --> 02:56:40.123
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, Unreal 3 is so hard to use.

02:56:40.543 --> 02:56:43.206
[SPEAKER_05]: And they made our game shit.

02:56:43.686 --> 02:56:46.929
[SPEAKER_05]: Not because we suck or anything, but they lost.

02:56:47.729 --> 02:56:48.030
[SPEAKER_05]: Boop.

02:56:49.271 --> 02:56:58.679
[SPEAKER_05]: So, on top of that, not only did they lose, but the new ruling, I guess, doubled the damages from 4.5 million to 9 million.

02:57:00.540 --> 02:57:10.585
[SPEAKER_05]: And on top of that, they also have to destroy any games that they have, any unsold games that they have using the Unreal 3 engine.

02:57:12.326 --> 02:57:14.747
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

02:57:15.508 --> 02:57:26.213
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess that means Two Human, X-Men, Destiny, Siren in Maelstorm, The Sandman, and The Box slash Ritualist.

02:57:30.050 --> 02:57:32.291
[SPEAKER_13]: All these games I was a really big fan of.

02:57:33.152 --> 02:57:38.535
[SPEAKER_05]: So if they're destroying all these games, would that mean that they have to... They're going in a landfill.

02:57:39.235 --> 02:57:42.317
[SPEAKER_05]: By destroying, does that mean that they just get to work on them a little bit longer?

02:57:48.340 --> 02:57:50.582
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what you get when you place the blame on somebody else.

02:57:51.962 --> 02:57:54.744
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, it was just your inept ability to program these games.

02:57:57.156 --> 02:58:04.342
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, well, one more story for you guys, then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:58:04.683 --> 02:58:06.765
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a story about Charles Huang.

02:58:06.805 --> 02:58:10.288
[SPEAKER_13]: If you don't know that name, you probably know something he co-created.

02:58:10.328 --> 02:58:11.529
[SPEAKER_13]: It's Guitar Hero.

02:58:12.089 --> 02:58:13.210
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, what's he doing now?

02:58:13.290 --> 02:58:16.733
[SPEAKER_13]: Is he doing another music game or doing something else with gaming?

02:58:17.314 --> 02:58:18.175
[SPEAKER_13]: Not exactly.

02:58:18.835 --> 02:58:23.837
[SPEAKER_13]: It's called Green Throttle Games is the company he's working on.

02:58:24.717 --> 02:58:27.458
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a mobile to TV app and controller.

02:58:27.578 --> 02:58:35.960
[SPEAKER_13]: What it's trying to do is turning smartphone games into a big screen experience by connecting a mobile device directly to an HDTV.

02:58:36.580 --> 02:58:42.462
[SPEAKER_13]: This will be playable on wireless, Bluetooth controllers via what's called the Green Throttle Arena app.

02:58:42.942 --> 02:58:49.325
[SPEAKER_13]: In other words, I think it's a great idea, but Apple could knock this out of business in a heartbeat.

02:58:49.745 --> 02:58:51.506
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a dangerous territory, I think.

02:58:51.766 --> 02:58:56.989
[SPEAKER_13]: Because a lot of people have been saying Apple TV is only moments away from doing something like this.

02:58:57.389 --> 02:58:58.390
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

02:58:58.670 --> 02:59:01.251
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all fan wank, and Apple hasn't done it.

02:59:01.531 --> 02:59:02.752
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:59:22.993 --> 02:59:23.614
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

02:59:38.502 --> 02:59:48.748
[SPEAKER_05]: like a DualShock 3 controller or a Wii Remote with the Classic Controller Pro or something like that tied in with it.

02:59:49.129 --> 02:59:56.113
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a lot of games that do support these things and with a TV out cable, you can do this already.

02:59:56.473 --> 03:00:03.057
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're wrapping in a nice package, I guess, so that it's easy for consumers to find all the games that support this controller.

03:00:03.197 --> 03:00:06.539
[SPEAKER_13]: and it's important to note they are also developing their own games in-house.

03:00:07.119 --> 03:00:14.543
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, even if Apple were to push a button and really fuck this idea over, they'd still have, hopefully, some solid games to fall back on.

03:00:14.563 --> 03:00:16.344
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm surprised they haven't done anything like that.

03:00:16.584 --> 03:00:23.268
[SPEAKER_13]: And, to be fair, I want to throw this out here to give this whole thing a break because I don't want to sound like I'm poo-pooing the idea because I'm not.

03:00:23.748 --> 03:00:27.110
[SPEAKER_13]: I would love to be able to play smartphone games on the TV.

03:00:27.170 --> 03:00:29.151
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot I would like to be able to do that with.

03:00:29.851 --> 03:00:29.911
[SPEAKER_13]: Um...

03:00:31.212 --> 03:00:34.134
[SPEAKER_13]: But, um, that's my train of thought.

03:00:34.154 --> 03:00:34.874
[SPEAKER_13]: Where was I going with this?

03:00:35.535 --> 03:00:38.537
[SPEAKER_13]: The, um, Radio Guy's Worst Enemy.

03:00:38.597 --> 03:00:39.017
[SPEAKER_13]: Antarctica.

03:00:39.397 --> 03:00:40.318
[SPEAKER_13]: Derailed Train.

03:00:40.358 --> 03:00:40.638
[SPEAKER_05]: Penguins.

03:00:40.658 --> 03:00:43.840
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a lot of the games also, it seems like a lot of them are touch-based.

03:00:43.960 --> 03:00:48.563
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, not necessarily the games that they're pitching, but like, you know, like Angry Birds and stuff like that.

03:00:48.803 --> 03:00:49.564
[SPEAKER_13]: I know what I was going to say.

03:00:50.605 --> 03:00:57.249
[SPEAKER_13]: Open Feint is like an Apple, or is an iOS thing that a lot of gaming companies use.

03:00:57.629 --> 03:01:00.070
[SPEAKER_13]: to plug into their games to do online leaderboards and so forth.

03:01:00.390 --> 03:01:07.532
[SPEAKER_13]: Game Center hasn't put that out of business because OpenFaint, I guess, offers either it's easier to implement or it's a richer package.

03:01:07.592 --> 03:01:08.393
[SPEAKER_05]: It's multi-platform.

03:01:08.673 --> 03:01:10.033
[SPEAKER_13]: Multi-platform as well.

03:01:10.753 --> 03:01:12.474
[SPEAKER_13]: So who knows?

03:01:12.734 --> 03:01:18.156
[SPEAKER_13]: Green Throttle could go multi-platform too, I would think, hypothetically, with Android tablets or whatever.

03:01:18.476 --> 03:01:32.125
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm thinking even if they did something like that where Apple TV or whatever had some sort of Bluetooth support, which I honestly, I'm surprised that that device doesn't have Bluetooth support, the whole Apple TV.

03:01:32.325 --> 03:01:40.271
[SPEAKER_05]: What they could do, which would be interesting, is have, if you have an Apple TV, because doesn't the Apple TV support streaming?

03:01:40.471 --> 03:01:45.654
[SPEAKER_05]: You can content stream stuff from your iPod or iPad to the TV.

03:01:45.694 --> 03:01:48.216
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe say you content stream something,

03:01:48.756 --> 03:02:07.092
[SPEAKER_05]: to the TV, and then you use a Bluetooth controller with that, and then you can basically use the iPad or iPod or iPhone device as like a tether, almost like using the Wii Classic Controller or Classic Controller Pro with the Wii.

03:02:07.152 --> 03:02:10.475
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to use the Wii Remote as kind of like the Bluetooth tether to that.

03:02:10.715 --> 03:02:10.855
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

03:02:13.726 --> 03:02:20.429
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, well, we're going to move on to the Skype line, 1-877-GAME-OLR, or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

03:02:20.509 --> 03:02:22.289
[SPEAKER_13]: It is open for business now.

03:02:22.569 --> 03:02:31.833
[SPEAKER_13]: In the meantime, we'll get some last-minute stories, and I want to do some Twitter topics as well, things that were sent in to twitter.com slash OLR.

03:02:32.913 --> 03:02:34.354
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to do this one first.

03:02:34.414 --> 03:02:37.115
[SPEAKER_13]: This is from, damn it, come on, load.

03:02:37.375 --> 03:02:37.675
[SPEAKER_13]: Here we go.

03:02:38.275 --> 03:02:39.656
[SPEAKER_13]: This one's from Actdeft.

03:02:40.436 --> 03:02:42.999
[SPEAKER_13]: Give a listen to the Wii U menu music.

03:02:43.239 --> 03:02:45.121
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really good and entrancing.

03:02:46.123 --> 03:02:48.205
[SPEAKER_13]: I did not know that this was out but apparently here it is.

03:02:59.917 --> 03:03:00.737
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's the thing though.

03:03:01.177 --> 03:03:14.642
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to go into skeptic mode here because I noticed that the YouTube here has a link to a website where it says full album available and then it says check out more Wii U music and news at such and such website and it's not an official Nintendo site either.

03:03:14.682 --> 03:03:23.244
[SPEAKER_13]: Now I'm not saying maybe these guys didn't get a Wii U somehow but I'm always kind of curious when it's this much blatant like go here, go to this site.

03:03:23.344 --> 03:03:24.345
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

03:03:24.405 --> 03:03:24.905
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just saying.

03:03:25.025 --> 03:03:25.425
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just saying.

03:03:26.445 --> 03:03:28.946
[SPEAKER_13]: But, um... Could be legit.

03:03:30.327 --> 03:03:30.827
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you think?

03:03:30.887 --> 03:03:31.487
[SPEAKER_13]: Is this it?

03:03:31.547 --> 03:03:32.187
[SPEAKER_13]: Is this the real deal?

03:03:32.267 --> 03:03:33.508
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds pretty Nintendo-y.

03:03:33.668 --> 03:03:34.968
[SPEAKER_10]: It does sound a little pretty Nintendo-y.

03:03:35.008 --> 03:03:35.489
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe it.

03:03:36.669 --> 03:03:38.990
Um... Yeah, I'm not sure.

03:03:39.550 --> 03:03:40.851
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll know within days.

03:03:41.991 --> 03:03:45.533
[SPEAKER_13]: Because those things are going to be out very, very, very soon.

03:03:46.733 --> 03:03:47.293
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's go to phones.

03:03:48.174 --> 03:03:49.054
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

03:03:49.074 --> 03:03:49.414
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's this?

03:03:50.515 --> 03:03:51.495
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, so we're Nate.

03:03:51.615 --> 03:03:52.315
[SPEAKER_04]: How's it going?

03:03:52.415 --> 03:03:52.936
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, good.

03:03:52.956 --> 03:03:53.596
[SPEAKER_13]: How are you, Nate?

03:03:54.683 --> 03:03:55.284
[SPEAKER_04]: Going good.

03:03:55.344 --> 03:04:00.650
[SPEAKER_04]: I listened to all y'all talks about vaporware and green throttle and Wii U music.

03:04:01.091 --> 03:04:06.557
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to ask you all who you think is going to win the upcoming console war.

03:04:07.472 --> 03:04:09.714
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's going to win the upcoming console war?

03:04:10.254 --> 03:04:12.616
[SPEAKER_05]: And to answer your question whether that was legit or not, yes, it is.

03:04:12.696 --> 03:04:14.578
[SPEAKER_05]: And they actually have more menu music.

03:04:14.738 --> 03:04:21.584
[SPEAKER_05]: Because Kotaku, they have their own Wii U thing, and they wouldn't post a story like that if it was completely wrong.

03:04:21.604 --> 03:04:24.206
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they have a Wii U to compare that to.

03:04:24.266 --> 03:04:24.546
[SPEAKER_13]: I see.

03:04:24.586 --> 03:04:26.027
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thank you for that clarification.

03:04:26.087 --> 03:04:28.229
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just always a little skeptical when it's the internet.

03:04:28.249 --> 03:04:28.890
[SPEAKER_13]: Always a little skeptical.

03:04:29.270 --> 03:04:30.050
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, so Nate's...

03:04:30.851 --> 03:04:31.872
[SPEAKER_13]: Loaded question.

03:04:31.912 --> 03:04:32.292
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm kidding.

03:04:32.312 --> 03:04:33.033
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not a loaded question.

03:04:33.093 --> 03:04:33.814
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a tough question.

03:04:34.094 --> 03:04:35.795
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's going to win the upcoming console war?

03:04:36.196 --> 03:04:39.378
[SPEAKER_13]: Nate, I think it's too damn early to tell.

03:04:39.919 --> 03:04:41.880
[SPEAKER_13]: You only have one console.

03:04:43.321 --> 03:04:49.687
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, here's the thing, because we don't know what PlayStation 4 and what the new Xbox have under their belt.

03:04:51.808 --> 03:04:53.909
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not really going to know that until E3.

03:04:58.851 --> 03:05:03.033
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now we have to also evaluate how is the Wii U going to do.

03:05:03.434 --> 03:05:07.896
[SPEAKER_13]: We're hearing about sellouts and pre-order stuff and that they're hard to get.

03:05:08.496 --> 03:05:38.066
[SPEAKER_13]: but how much of that is legitimately everybody wants them in demand and how much of that is Nintendo is slowly like a faucet drip letting these consoles out to create that artificial demand well I'm going to tell you right now who's going to win the whole console wars here and it's going to come out of left field here it's the GE micro box microwave slash console because we're talking about the future and no one knows what the future is that's what's going to win microwave console

03:05:43.170 --> 03:06:01.705
[SPEAKER_04]: okay another question all right okay so I'll hear you all talking about Green Throttle um if you if you have to pick between Green Throttle and Ouya who you vote for oh damn that's a pretty good question because I don't I don't really know enough about Green Throttle yet um

03:06:02.885 --> 03:06:08.466
[SPEAKER_04]: Based on presentation and power and fame, glory, money.

03:06:08.906 --> 03:06:20.949
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to have to go OUYA only reason because it's an actual console versus it's basically Green Throttle is just, okay, we have a controller that's paired with some games that we're making, but it doesn't have any hardware platform that it's meant for.

03:06:21.149 --> 03:06:24.050
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have like their own Android device or something.

03:06:24.130 --> 03:06:27.951
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're going to get varied performance depending on what kind of Android device that you have.

03:06:28.411 --> 03:06:37.557
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the only problem there is it's not a standardized platform, whereas the Ouya is actually going to be a device that they make games for that they know will run well on that platform.

03:06:37.837 --> 03:06:50.285
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to say the Ouya as well because, again, I'm a little concerned about Apple could really knock this green-throttled thing down a few pegs by doing their own thing, whereas the Ouya is going to be a little tougher.

03:06:50.385 --> 03:06:53.467
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the Ouya is kind of trying to beat Apple at its own game in a way.

03:06:53.887 --> 03:06:54.787
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's a little different.

03:06:55.188 --> 03:06:57.029
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm going to go Ouya as well.

03:06:58.250 --> 03:06:58.851
[SPEAKER_04]: Last question.

03:06:58.971 --> 03:07:09.059
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the best game you think is going to come out between now and summer?

03:07:10.020 --> 03:07:11.121
[SPEAKER_13]: Now and summer.

03:07:11.221 --> 03:07:18.487
[SPEAKER_13]: So of all these games that got pushed back to 2013 that make up the first and second quarter releases, what's going to be the best game to come out?

03:07:18.907 --> 03:07:20.609
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to say Mass Effect Trilogy on PS3.

03:07:22.429 --> 03:07:23.491
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

03:07:24.832 --> 03:07:28.637
[SPEAKER_13]: I am really looking forward to the Tomb Raider reboot.

03:07:29.238 --> 03:07:30.500
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not coming out before summer.

03:07:31.421 --> 03:07:32.222
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, get out.

03:07:32.302 --> 03:07:34.065
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought it was pushed back to only like March.

03:07:36.188 --> 03:07:38.611
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, yeah, go look that up in your Funkin' Wagnalls.

03:07:41.139 --> 03:07:42.701
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm looking forward to Omega.

03:07:43.382 --> 03:07:44.644
[SPEAKER_13]: Omega DLC.

03:07:44.724 --> 03:07:45.225
[SPEAKER_13]: Massive.

03:07:45.265 --> 03:07:46.086
[SPEAKER_13]: Are there any games?

03:07:46.166 --> 03:07:46.507
[SPEAKER_13]: Come on.

03:07:47.168 --> 03:07:47.989
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Omega.

03:07:48.730 --> 03:07:52.595
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if it'll make summer, Nate, but the Final Fantasy 14 Realm Reborn.

03:07:52.856 --> 03:07:53.817
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's fall next year.

03:07:53.857 --> 03:07:55.079
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm damn curious about that.

03:07:56.583 --> 03:07:58.724
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't give questions but yes ask away

03:08:26.229 --> 03:08:31.333
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, you've asked us about console wars and what we're looking forward to and all this stuff.

03:08:31.873 --> 03:08:34.616
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you want to see happen in gaming in 2013?

03:08:37.158 --> 03:08:43.783
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I'm just going to be a little vague because there's other things I could talk about but I don't want to talk about now.

03:08:45.164 --> 03:08:55.112
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to see the rise of indie gaming and also far less social games and all these small touchscreen games.

03:08:55.711 --> 03:08:57.353
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I would like to see less of in 2013.

03:08:57.393 --> 03:08:59.436
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have a smartphone, so that's like a no.

03:09:15.787 --> 03:09:18.208
[SPEAKER_13]: So screw everybody else.

03:09:18.288 --> 03:09:21.270
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a console-er, PC-er.

03:09:22.150 --> 03:09:24.531
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll try to play Angry Birds, but that's about it.

03:09:24.671 --> 03:09:25.132
[SPEAKER_13]: PC.

03:09:25.412 --> 03:09:26.252
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

03:09:26.893 --> 03:09:31.255
[SPEAKER_13]: Indie, of course, has a huge life on PC, and lots of great indie stuff gets their start on PC.

03:09:31.935 --> 03:09:32.995
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm with you.

03:09:33.035 --> 03:09:35.096
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like to see some more indie games make it big.

03:09:35.437 --> 03:09:38.918
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, the best games to come, we probably don't even know about yet.

03:09:39.378 --> 03:09:39.899
[SPEAKER_13]: Think about that.

03:09:40.539 --> 03:09:40.819
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

03:09:41.740 --> 03:09:42.780
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for the questions.

03:09:42.840 --> 03:09:43.600
[SPEAKER_13]: We appreciate it.

03:09:43.760 --> 03:09:44.581
[SPEAKER_13]: Have a good one, buddy, okay?

03:09:45.615 --> 03:09:46.315
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, talk to you later.

03:09:46.335 --> 03:09:46.855
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, you too.

03:09:46.995 --> 03:09:47.195
[SPEAKER_13]: Bye.

03:09:47.936 --> 03:09:48.116
[SPEAKER_13]: Bye.

03:09:48.836 --> 03:09:49.476
[SPEAKER_13]: See, I like that.

03:09:49.516 --> 03:09:51.396
[SPEAKER_13]: I like the whole, you're going to ask me questions?

03:09:51.556 --> 03:09:53.057
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah, buddy, I got a question for you.

03:09:53.077 --> 03:09:56.238
[SPEAKER_13]: Our job sucks, huh?

03:09:56.298 --> 03:09:56.838
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm kidding.

03:09:56.858 --> 03:09:57.538
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I loved it.

03:09:57.858 --> 03:09:59.498
[SPEAKER_13]: I love getting questions.

03:09:59.518 --> 03:10:02.259
[SPEAKER_13]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or I use your name on Skype.

03:10:03.099 --> 03:10:03.739
[SPEAKER_13]: Orange Lounge Radio.

03:10:05.360 --> 03:10:06.100
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's go to the phones.

03:10:08.360 --> 03:10:09.241
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

03:10:09.261 --> 03:10:09.641
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's this?

03:10:10.161 --> 03:10:11.081
[SPEAKER_13]: Legend of Zaku here.

03:10:11.121 --> 03:10:12.942
[SPEAKER_13]: Zaku, you must have loved that interview tonight.

03:10:14.122 --> 03:10:14.382
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello?

03:10:15.080 --> 03:10:15.500
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks for watching!

03:10:39.451 --> 03:10:52.754
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess this is probably going to be out of the ordinary, but I've had this thing that had my Steam collection that I've been wanting to wrangle down because I've gotten so many games yet I have a backlog.

03:10:53.114 --> 03:11:01.357
[SPEAKER_09]: It's created such a backlog that I'm not sure how to actually systematically approach having to tackle all these games I have.

03:11:01.377 --> 03:11:02.957
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to post it right now in the chat room.

03:11:05.631 --> 03:11:14.923
[SPEAKER_09]: I have some of them already, I'm putting time on them, but there's still plenty that I just bought because they were cheap at that point and I just got them for the sake of getting them.

03:11:15.644 --> 03:11:23.654
[SPEAKER_09]: But now it's like, I don't know, I'm preventing myself from getting games because it's going to add more fuel to the fire.

03:11:23.874 --> 03:11:27.276
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you're doing the right thing by investing 99 hours in Skyrim.

03:11:27.776 --> 03:11:30.778
[SPEAKER_13]: 52 hours, Team 76, Battlefield Bad Company.

03:11:30.858 --> 03:11:32.719
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, you got your priorities right.

03:11:32.819 --> 03:11:35.140
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just trying to see if there's a game you're not playing enough.

03:11:35.781 --> 03:11:36.781
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, Torchlight?

03:11:36.861 --> 03:11:37.502
[SPEAKER_13]: What's up with this?

03:11:37.642 --> 03:11:39.142
[SPEAKER_13]: Less than an hour on Torchlight.

03:11:39.222 --> 03:11:40.143
[SPEAKER_13]: You gotta fix that, buddy.

03:11:40.203 --> 03:11:43.245
[SPEAKER_09]: I have put in more time, but that was on my Mac.

03:11:43.725 --> 03:11:44.525
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, fair enough.

03:11:45.066 --> 03:11:52.150
[SPEAKER_09]: That was when I was heading down to Otakon on the train and I didn't even have a connection, so I was playing offline.

03:11:53.174 --> 03:11:55.877
[SPEAKER_09]: So that time didn't get counted for yet.

03:11:57.319 --> 03:12:01.905
[SPEAKER_13]: You would make Alan a very sad puppy with all these Half-Life games you own that you haven't even played yet.

03:12:02.445 --> 03:12:03.166
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, I know.

03:12:03.206 --> 03:12:04.408
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm guilty of that.

03:12:05.269 --> 03:12:11.316
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm also in between Battlefield 3 and Hawks, which is crapping out on me, so I had to switch up to other games.

03:12:11.736 --> 03:12:13.037
[SPEAKER_13]: and Loki.

03:12:13.337 --> 03:12:13.717
[SPEAKER_13]: Look at this.

03:12:13.897 --> 03:12:17.900
[SPEAKER_13]: Loki, look what he's got here sitting in his collection untouched right there.

03:12:17.940 --> 03:12:18.400
[SPEAKER_13]: You see that?

03:12:19.080 --> 03:12:21.482
[SPEAKER_13]: Grand Theft Auto 4 and episodes from Liberty City.

03:12:21.502 --> 03:12:22.662
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you have to say about that?

03:12:23.122 --> 03:12:24.063
[SPEAKER_13]: Probably got them really cheap.

03:12:24.903 --> 03:12:25.164
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

03:12:25.264 --> 03:12:26.104
[SPEAKER_13]: You can do that.

03:12:27.845 --> 03:12:30.447
[SPEAKER_13]: you know what buddy it's all good at least you're supporting these developers

03:12:53.368 --> 03:12:54.509
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, one more thing.

03:12:54.749 --> 03:13:07.279
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing that Black Friday and the holiday shopping season is upon us, I'm kind of at a crossroads where, like, I don't know what else to invest in my 360 that isn't already out on PC and isn't already on another platform.

03:13:07.879 --> 03:13:19.929
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, every time I go to GameStop or any video game store, I'm always hard, I'm always pressed as to trying to find something that, A, obviously isn't PC or on a PS3, and B, isn't like a first-person shooter.

03:13:20.789 --> 03:13:30.073
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's kind of like finding that small scope of console exclusives that I can't really play that I would normally otherwise play on another platform.

03:13:30.973 --> 03:13:43.458
[SPEAKER_13]: Honestly, Zaku, if Xbox Live isn't doing it for you and the community on there and the indie games and some of the stuff that you can download on Xbox and all that, maybe you should think about offloading your Xbox.

03:13:43.578 --> 03:13:46.840
[SPEAKER_13]: Because, yeah, when it comes to exclusives, you know, Microsoft's...

03:13:48.540 --> 03:13:49.281
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, there's Kinect.

03:13:49.421 --> 03:13:51.681
[SPEAKER_09]: A PS3 is definitely... Yeah, I know.

03:13:51.781 --> 03:13:59.564
[SPEAKER_09]: I can understand that I'm kind of contemplating it, but on the other hand, I am long overdue for a PS3.

03:13:59.744 --> 03:14:06.366
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's just say that my girlfriend was hinting at telling me to avoid getting one in the next couple of weeks.

03:14:06.826 --> 03:14:13.608
[SPEAKER_09]: I can pretty much say with certainty that she's probably hinting towards getting me something like that.

03:14:14.388 --> 03:14:14.968
[SPEAKER_09]: What a nice girl.

03:14:14.988 --> 03:14:15.949
[SPEAKER_09]: So I might be able to...

03:14:16.969 --> 03:14:26.412
[SPEAKER_09]: to exploit that avenue in terms of playing the PS3 exclusives that I missed out on, like Gran Turismo 5, the Uncharted series, Metal Gear Solid 4.

03:14:26.612 --> 03:14:28.092
[SPEAKER_13]: No, Gran Turismo 5 never came out.

03:14:29.853 --> 03:14:30.173
[SPEAKER_09]: Did.

03:14:30.193 --> 03:14:32.894
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a running joke.

03:14:32.914 --> 03:14:34.014
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not what Bobby said.

03:14:34.054 --> 03:14:35.115
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not what Bobby said.

03:14:36.815 --> 03:14:39.236
[SPEAKER_09]: It did, but it's like, yeah, it's kind of like that.

03:14:40.458 --> 03:14:45.603
[SPEAKER_09]: Redheaded Stepchild, but I mean, with GT5, I could plug in a high-end racing wheel.

03:14:46.244 --> 03:14:57.835
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't be able to do a Forza, for example, since I'm not going to play with some virtual wireless wheel that I have to pretend like doing air steering, which I have, which is garbage.

03:14:57.915 --> 03:14:59.877
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't have to do air steering with Forza, though.

03:15:01.759 --> 03:15:07.604
[SPEAKER_13]: Bobby was very kind to Forza, and he wrote the review on vognetwork.com, and I know Actdeft's a big fan of it as well.

03:15:07.724 --> 03:15:08.585
[SPEAKER_13]: I played the demo.

03:15:08.985 --> 03:15:14.871
[SPEAKER_13]: I liked it, but I just spent $120 on games this week, so I won't be picking up Forza anytime soon, but I'm interested.

03:15:15.351 --> 03:15:41.279
[SPEAKER_09]: Force is pretty good for what it's worth on the 360, but in terms of actually for a hardcore racing gamer who wants to plug in their Logitech G27 in there, which is not even possible because it only supports PC and PS3, I'm basically forced to buy their bullshit wireless wheel that's just like a yoke-shaped

03:15:43.280 --> 03:15:43.680
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura.com

03:16:06.417 --> 03:16:06.918
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, buddy.

03:16:07.098 --> 03:16:07.919
[SPEAKER_09]: It's worth a shot.

03:16:08.300 --> 03:16:09.101
[SPEAKER_13]: Go to Montana.

03:16:09.201 --> 03:16:10.142
[SPEAKER_13]: Ain't no one care out there.

03:16:10.443 --> 03:16:12.906
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, Saku, I got to let you go so we can wrap up the show.

03:16:12.966 --> 03:16:14.048
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe get one more call, all right?

03:16:14.709 --> 03:16:15.009
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

03:16:15.209 --> 03:16:15.550
[SPEAKER_13]: Take care.

03:16:15.570 --> 03:16:16.211
[SPEAKER_13]: Have a good one.

03:16:16.391 --> 03:16:16.912
[SPEAKER_13]: Bye, you too.

03:16:16.932 --> 03:16:17.913
[SPEAKER_13]: Bye.

03:16:17.933 --> 03:16:18.213
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

03:16:18.233 --> 03:16:21.438
[SPEAKER_13]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

03:16:21.818 --> 03:16:24.260
[SPEAKER_13]: I suppose we have time for one more call.

03:16:43.251 --> 03:16:54.359
[SPEAKER_13]: If you do not own the Tatsunoko vs. Capcom game, you better hurry up and find it in a bargain bin somewhere because Capcom no longer holds the rights to publish Tatsunoko games.

03:16:54.419 --> 03:16:56.261
[SPEAKER_13]: That was a limited deal.

03:16:57.562 --> 03:16:59.283
[SPEAKER_10]: I have mine.

03:16:59.904 --> 03:17:02.946
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're hoping for a part two, keep right on hoping.

03:17:04.318 --> 03:17:06.000
[SPEAKER_13]: Foxconn rumored to be planting US plants

03:17:17.952 --> 03:17:21.614
[SPEAKER_13]: Isn't Foxconn that company in China that all those controversial stories?

03:17:21.874 --> 03:17:24.696
[SPEAKER_13]: Is this a goodwill thing or what is this?

03:17:25.076 --> 03:17:28.378
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, apparently they are evaluating Detroit and L.A.

03:17:28.418 --> 03:17:29.379
[SPEAKER_13]: for new operations.

03:17:30.839 --> 03:17:32.400
[SPEAKER_11]: They're outsourcing here?

03:17:33.261 --> 03:17:34.181
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we cheaper labor?

03:17:35.322 --> 03:17:38.604
[SPEAKER_13]: Hold on, I'll get back to the story in a minute, but we got one more call coming in.

03:17:38.624 --> 03:17:40.145
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll take this call and then we'll go back to the story.

03:17:40.905 --> 03:17:41.826
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, you're on Orange Silence Radio.

03:17:41.866 --> 03:17:42.226
[SPEAKER_13]: Who's this?

03:17:43.166 --> 03:17:43.987
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, this is Actdeft.

03:17:44.247 --> 03:17:44.827
[SPEAKER_13]: Actdeft.

03:17:44.847 --> 03:17:45.548
[SPEAKER_13]: What's on your mind, buddy?

03:17:46.963 --> 03:17:51.647
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I want to talk about Forza Horizon 2, something that Zaku said.

03:17:52.307 --> 03:17:52.688
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh-oh.

03:17:52.768 --> 03:17:53.048
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

03:17:53.068 --> 03:17:55.330
[SPEAKER_13]: What did you want to say in response to what Zaku said?

03:17:56.591 --> 03:18:07.059
[SPEAKER_08]: He says Forza isn't, or Forza Horizon isn't made for, well, playing it with a real controller or racing controller.

03:18:07.880 --> 03:18:09.922
[SPEAKER_08]: And he's pretty wrong on that.

03:18:10.282 --> 03:18:10.923
[SPEAKER_08]: He's wrong.

03:18:10.983 --> 03:18:11.723
[SPEAKER_08]: You're calling him out.

03:18:12.124 --> 03:18:12.724
[SPEAKER_08]: Why is he wrong?

03:18:14.165 --> 03:18:24.376
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, basically, one of my friends I play Forza frequently with, he has a Fanta controller, and those controllers are, like, really expensive.

03:18:26.178 --> 03:18:32.865
[SPEAKER_08]: They have a lot of stuff that makes it feel like you're driving a real car, so...

03:18:34.449 --> 03:18:51.080
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, you can play with a real controller, a good controller, even though it does feel different, even from Forza 4, but you can still play it.

03:18:51.961 --> 03:18:59.186
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, Zaku in chat is clarifying, I didn't bash Forza Horizon, Forza 4 sucked ass on the 360 wireless steering wheel.

03:18:59.366 --> 03:18:59.726
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's...

03:19:02.506 --> 03:19:03.307
[SPEAKER_08]: That's different.

03:19:03.627 --> 03:19:06.149
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know about the 360 controller.

03:19:06.709 --> 03:19:09.851
[SPEAKER_13]: Forza Horizon, the demo played alright to me.

03:19:10.051 --> 03:19:12.533
[SPEAKER_13]: It was really stupid proof.

03:19:12.793 --> 03:19:14.395
[SPEAKER_13]: The demo was really stupid proof.

03:19:14.475 --> 03:19:18.617
[SPEAKER_13]: I played on easy and it was like, here, let me break the car for you.

03:19:18.698 --> 03:19:21.159
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like having a driving instructor sitting right next to you.

03:19:21.219 --> 03:19:24.161
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm like, oh, this is what I needed to be able to play Forza.

03:19:24.201 --> 03:19:24.842
[SPEAKER_13]: This is great.

03:19:26.463 --> 03:19:27.664
[SPEAKER_13]: I am being totally honest.

03:19:28.936 --> 03:19:36.823
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I have played since Forza 2 and I loved it because it's so easy to pretty much pick up and play.

03:19:37.183 --> 03:19:50.494
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though it does get harder on later races or difficulty, it's pretty much easy to play because you have so much things that help the driver or the player.

03:19:51.656 --> 03:20:01.814
[SPEAKER_08]: that you can pretty much screw up a race even though the game will help you to correct that and be a better player.

03:20:03.044 --> 03:20:06.365
[SPEAKER_13]: So you give Forza Horizon your stamp of approval as well.

03:20:06.405 --> 03:20:08.426
[SPEAKER_13]: I know I saw Bobby gave it a good review on the site.

03:20:08.586 --> 03:20:09.767
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you give it a good review too?

03:20:10.887 --> 03:20:19.390
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I pretty much gave the same points as Bobby, even though the difficulty in Forza Horizon can be pretty unforgiving.

03:20:19.990 --> 03:20:21.431
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's still a great game.

03:20:22.571 --> 03:20:25.272
[SPEAKER_08]: Even single player or multiplayer, it's really good.

03:20:26.013 --> 03:20:26.313
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

03:20:26.833 --> 03:20:29.215
[SPEAKER_13]: And it looks like they just want to clarify one more thing.

03:20:29.315 --> 03:20:30.997
[SPEAKER_13]: Not bashing the game, says BlackWolf.

03:20:31.037 --> 03:20:33.439
[SPEAKER_13]: He's bashing Microsoft's controller standards.

03:20:34.400 --> 03:20:34.900
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I know.

03:20:35.281 --> 03:20:38.704
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, but like I said, if you have a good controller, it will work.

03:20:38.924 --> 03:20:43.989
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, 360 does have some, that controller does leave some things to be desired, especially when it comes to that D-pad.

03:20:44.429 --> 03:20:47.972
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, Actdeft, I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much, buddy, okay?

03:20:48.673 --> 03:20:48.953
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

03:20:49.093 --> 03:20:49.614
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, take care.

03:20:50.374 --> 03:20:51.975
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

03:20:52.275 --> 03:20:54.476
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to close it up because we are running a little long.

03:20:54.716 --> 03:20:59.098
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to finish up Twitter and then I'll let Loki do any last minute stories or Jamie.

03:21:00.338 --> 03:21:09.322
[SPEAKER_13]: That Foxconn story, let's see, it's a Digitimes report saying that Foxconn Electronics plans to set up manufacturing plants in the US looking at Detroit and Los Angeles.

03:21:10.183 --> 03:21:24.600
[SPEAKER_13]: market watchers are the source of the news these facilities would be expected to handle LCD TV manufacturing it's a simpler and more automated process so it requires a lot less suicide stop it

03:21:26.002 --> 03:21:29.545
[SPEAKER_13]: Take that with a gigantic grain of salt, but there you go.

03:21:31.126 --> 03:21:34.409
[SPEAKER_13]: One other tweet I want to read here is from SpazinatorPSN on Twitter.

03:21:35.009 --> 03:21:39.533
[SPEAKER_13]: Sky, I'm challenging to top some of my high scores in Game Room.

03:21:40.053 --> 03:21:41.515
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I said Game Room.

03:21:41.895 --> 03:21:42.075
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

03:21:42.195 --> 03:21:42.535
[SPEAKER_13]: What's that?

03:21:42.555 --> 03:21:43.616
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to party like it's 2010.

03:21:43.696 --> 03:21:45.878
[SPEAKER_13]: What's a Game Room?

03:21:46.879 --> 03:21:48.100
[SPEAKER_13]: He's talking about Microsoft Game Room.

03:21:48.600 --> 03:21:51.701
[SPEAKER_13]: I haven't touched Game Room in a while, and I should.

03:21:51.841 --> 03:21:55.122
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to go back, and I'll go back.

03:21:55.142 --> 03:21:59.144
[SPEAKER_13]: I did spend money on a lot of those games, a lot more than I really should be admitting.

03:21:59.484 --> 03:22:02.725
[SPEAKER_13]: So I do need to go back and show Spazinator how it's done.

03:22:02.945 --> 03:22:04.745
[SPEAKER_13]: So fine.

03:22:05.226 --> 03:22:06.166
[SPEAKER_13]: Challenge accepted.

03:22:06.186 --> 03:22:08.707
[SPEAKER_13]: Probably be able to set some high scores because no one plays it anymore.

03:22:08.727 --> 03:22:09.687
[SPEAKER_13]: Challenge accepted.

03:22:11.440 --> 03:22:13.241
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, any last minute stories?

03:22:13.321 --> 03:22:13.861
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a couple.

03:22:14.201 --> 03:22:17.383
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a comment about Minecraft.

03:22:17.823 --> 03:22:23.185
[SPEAKER_05]: They were basically saying that the future of Minecraft is the consumer.

03:22:23.385 --> 03:22:33.809
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reason that is is because one of the things that they're working on is the whole new mod interface that they're going to allow people to be able to mod Minecraft a lot easier.

03:22:34.090 --> 03:22:35.710
[SPEAKER_05]: Because right now it's a little bit difficult.

03:22:35.750 --> 03:22:38.932
[SPEAKER_05]: You kind of have to replace files in the jar file and stuff like that.

03:22:38.972 --> 03:22:39.612
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just not...

03:22:40.092 --> 03:22:40.653
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

03:23:04.167 --> 03:23:13.371
[SPEAKER_05]: Ubisoft wants to get their full retail games onto the Wii U eShop as soon as possible.

03:23:14.752 --> 03:23:20.315
[SPEAKER_05]: I can understand why, because they had a good portion of the games for the Vita launch, and I bet a lot of those sold digitally.

03:23:21.204 --> 03:23:24.665
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, when there's nothing else to buy, your games look pretty appealing.

03:23:24.685 --> 03:23:26.106
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a lot of games.

03:23:26.206 --> 03:23:27.526
[SPEAKER_13]: Push button, get game.

03:23:27.766 --> 03:23:29.387
[SPEAKER_13]: You never even have to hand anybody money.

03:23:29.627 --> 03:23:42.492
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course, the problem with downloading the games is, remember, you need to have storage space, which really, you're only going to be able to get about one or two games on the premium model there.

03:23:42.672 --> 03:23:44.133
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to need an external hard drive.

03:23:46.073 --> 03:23:46.794
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an extra step.

03:23:46.834 --> 03:23:56.398
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand it's not necessarily an expensive step but it's still an extra step to have a hard drive to put those games on.

03:23:59.119 --> 03:23:59.459
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

03:24:00.037 --> 03:24:02.038
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, well that does it.

03:24:02.218 --> 03:24:04.478
[SPEAKER_13]: This is almost a three and a half hour show tonight.

03:24:04.978 --> 03:24:16.862
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it helps that we actually get to play the break tonight, so it helps give more content on the podcast and something for the worker bees who listen to our show on Mondays and Tuesdays and throughout the week, something to listen to.

03:24:17.602 --> 03:24:19.863
[SPEAKER_13]: I really want to thank you all for tuning in tonight.

03:24:19.904 --> 03:24:26.687
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to thank Eddie for coming on the show and staying for 45 minutes close to much more than the 15 to 20 I told him it would be.

03:24:27.288 --> 03:24:28.868
[SPEAKER_13]: So big thanks to him for coming out tonight.

03:24:29.209 --> 03:24:35.552
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to thank Jen from Girl Gamer Vogue for doing that interview with DJ Ranma S as well.

03:24:35.572 --> 03:24:37.933
[SPEAKER_13]: That was great to meet her through Ranma.

03:24:38.494 --> 03:24:41.755
[SPEAKER_13]: And I want to thank my co-hosts for being here tonight too.

03:24:43.016 --> 03:24:44.157
[SPEAKER_13]: You're welcome.

03:24:44.637 --> 03:24:46.398
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to thank myself for being here.

03:24:46.678 --> 03:24:47.518
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Rob.

03:24:47.619 --> 03:24:50.560
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Rob, because if it weren't for you, I wouldn't be here tonight.

03:24:51.661 --> 03:24:53.021
[SPEAKER_13]: I wasn't even supposed to be here today.

03:24:54.462 --> 03:24:56.303
[SPEAKER_13]: And I want to thank the listeners for showing up.

03:24:56.483 --> 03:25:01.205
[SPEAKER_13]: Through apparently seven drops of the feed, they stayed with the show tonight.

03:25:01.466 --> 03:25:02.066
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, right?

03:25:02.166 --> 03:25:06.868
[SPEAKER_13]: We've got to figure out what the hell's... Like, Alan's not here, so there's no bandwidth coming out of the office tonight.

03:25:06.888 --> 03:25:09.129
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't think it's us, because... I don't think it is either.

03:25:09.309 --> 03:25:12.491
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm not getting disconnected from chat, so... Yeah, something's up.

03:25:12.531 --> 03:25:13.912
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not running anything either, so...

03:25:14.372 --> 03:25:17.134
[SPEAKER_13]: But anyway, thank you guys again for your support.

03:25:17.215 --> 03:25:20.497
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you got to the whole end of the show, you're listening on the podcast, you know what?

03:25:20.537 --> 03:25:22.819
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, too, for listening to all three and a half hours of it.

03:25:22.839 --> 03:25:23.680
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys rock.

03:25:24.201 --> 03:25:29.225
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, I could be really evil and vindictive and put the passphrase right here at the very, very end so people have to listen.

03:25:29.766 --> 03:25:30.206
[SPEAKER_13]: Boogers!

03:25:30.386 --> 03:25:30.987
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's not.

03:25:31.127 --> 03:25:31.507
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't listen.

03:25:31.587 --> 03:25:32.027
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not it.

03:25:34.069 --> 03:25:36.631
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyhow, let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

03:25:36.892 --> 03:25:38.213
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura, what's your final thought tonight?

03:25:38.504 --> 03:25:39.364
[SPEAKER_10]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

03:26:01.896 --> 03:26:08.360
[SPEAKER_10]: and meaning that all of the stock increases go directly into their retirement funds.

03:26:08.700 --> 03:26:09.060
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice.

03:26:09.320 --> 03:26:10.801
[SPEAKER_10]: As a trust they can also borrow from.

03:26:11.241 --> 03:26:16.144
[SPEAKER_10]: Which I wish more companies would be like that, you know, to work for the benefit of their employees.

03:26:16.204 --> 03:26:16.784
[SPEAKER_10]: And they make food.

03:26:16.804 --> 03:26:19.305
[SPEAKER_10]: Just saying, not all rich people are assholes, I guess.

03:26:21.314 --> 03:26:22.436
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

03:26:22.776 --> 03:26:23.738
[SPEAKER_05]: My car sucks.

03:26:24.098 --> 03:26:25.440
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully I get a new car, though.

03:26:25.901 --> 03:26:27.343
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we're looking at new cars now.

03:26:27.823 --> 03:26:29.746
[SPEAKER_05]: Or new to me cars.

03:26:30.627 --> 03:26:31.609
[SPEAKER_05]: Not necessarily new cars.

03:26:32.690 --> 03:26:33.191
[SPEAKER_05]: Less old?

03:26:34.593 --> 03:26:35.414
[SPEAKER_05]: Not necessarily.

03:26:36.316 --> 03:26:37.237
[SPEAKER_05]: Less mileage, hopefully.

03:26:38.178 --> 03:26:56.378
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to thank everybody for listening to the show tonight and sticking with it and remember if you like our show just tell a friend or two about the show help spread the word that's all we ask we don't charge for it or anything like that so just help spread the word about the VOG Network and what we're doing here and that's all we want just help grow our community

[SPEAKER_13]: That would be nice too.

03:27:05.025 --> 03:27:05.826
[SPEAKER_05]: No, don't cheat.

03:27:06.026 --> 03:27:06.467
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't cheat.

03:27:06.527 --> 03:27:08.328
[SPEAKER_10]: Just vote enthusiastically.

03:27:08.348 --> 03:27:10.390
[SPEAKER_05]: Just support multiple personalities.

03:27:12.532 --> 03:27:13.193

03:27:13.293 --> 03:27:15.054
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, that does it.

03:27:15.134 --> 03:27:15.715
[SPEAKER_13]: My final thought.

03:27:15.815 --> 03:27:17.977
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to go with an old classic.

03:27:18.557 --> 03:27:19.438
[SPEAKER_13]: My final thought tonight.

03:27:20.019 --> 03:27:22.501
[SPEAKER_13]: Be good to yourself and each other.

03:27:23.874 --> 03:27:25.357
[SPEAKER_13]: Be excellent to each other.

03:27:26.178 --> 03:27:27.381
[SPEAKER_13]: Have a wonderful week everybody.

03:27:27.421 --> 03:27:29.525
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll be back to do it all again next time.

03:27:29.625 --> 03:27:31.849
