Found on Road Dead Yeah, I've heard that one too From a parking lot But it doesn't work Yeah Alright, so we're going to get into some news and what we've been playing this week And some big interviews tonight that I will talk about in just a moment But I do want to start off the show first because we have some interviews tonight I know we might have a few new listeners because of that I want to say hello, welcome to the show Reintroduce ourselves a little bit We try to do that once every few months or so for those folks that are new to Orange Lounge Radio But if you are new to Orange Lounge Radio, hello We're a show, we created this show, myself, Dark Soccer and Loki all created this show Ten years ago, over ten years ago We all met playing a little game you might have heard of in the arcades Stomping arrows called Dance Dance Revolution And we used to play that pretty aggressively here in the south I don't know what other words you used to describe it We were angry DDR players Damn these arrows, damn them And birthday parties At Roseville Golf Land where we sat on the floor in front of the fourth mix and ate cake That was my birthday I still remember one of the first dream games we ever had on Orange Lounge Radio Was inspired by Golf Land trips You called it birthday party sniper Something like that Yeah, Roseville Golf Land is an interesting place It still is today, interesting is a good word to describe it Like people who pick their nose and eat it It's interesting I went not too long ago and wore myself out by DDR I was like, I got old I know right But anyway, ten years ago we all met playing DDR And we were really into that scene It wasn't just DDR It was a lot of the imports coming from Japan We used to have the Bamani parties here locally The sacramentals having the Bamani parties Where we'd bust out the Beatmania 5 key, the Beatmania 2DX Guitar freaks I remember I couldn't get that name because a Catholic organization took it Really? Yeah I forgot about that Well anyway So we decided to make this little show Because I have some prior radio experience dating back to college And another show I was on many years ago called Undersedation Live And myself, Dark Soccer, and Loki after a long day at the arcade No matter what we were playing at the time Whether it be DDR, Initial D, or something like that We used to go to a little restaurant that was in the parking lot And we'd just kind of sit around, order things that were bad for us Like mozzarella sticks And just talk some shit about video games And what was going on And so that was really the type of thing we wanted to bring here to the internets Is this giant virtual table Where we're all sitting on one side of it here in the studio Talking our stuff And then you guys kind of make up the rest of that table Sitting here with us in the chat room And via the Skype line and so forth Just talking some good stuff about video games And just having fun with it Because that's what video games are all about Fun and Talking smack about stupid people DDR and that whole thing and Beatmania Bimani in general Music games was really all about community So segueing a little bit into One of the interviews we're going to have tonight Is with our buddy Eddie He runs a website you might have heard of If you've played music games before It's called BimaniStyle.com And that site's been around a very long time In fact I think it's older than us By a few months So we're going to talk to Eddie tonight About community Because he has Especially now that DDR Freak is sunsetted It's no more He probably has the largest music game community that's out there So I want to talk to him just kind of about The past The future And so forth And have some fun commentary with him on that So we'll be talking to him in about 15 minutes or so Also on tonight's show We have another interview A taped interview we're going to play tonight during our break Where the music usually is This is something that DJ Rama S did for us And I'll talk more about this This whole That we have other people doing interviews I'll talk more about that later But this is an exciting interview It's Jen From a website called Girl Gamer Vogue GG Vogue.com She's going to talk about Her girl gaming community In the tri-state area back east And why she made it And what it's all about So we're going to have that a little later on in the show Probably closer to about 8 o'clock Before we get to the interviews and so forth We're going to get into our gaming weeks But I want to talk A little bit here At the top of the show about something personal Because we did talk about The shows are all about community And over these 10 years that we've been doing this show We have a lot of the same people that show up in our chat room week after week And they like to hear the little insights that are going on in our personal lives Both the good and the bad And I have to share something with you guys tonight That kind of happened I just want to get off my chest Because the weird thing about this is And I'm going to apologize to Jamie in advance for this Because a lot of this is very deja vu To a story that she told Not even three weeks ago Perfectly okay Just forgive me if I get sniffy It's fine The whole thing's just weird So you guys can probably guess where I'm going with this If I'm referencing that As many of you know I moved in with my boyfriend Allen About, gosh it was probably about Almost two years ago now And we Actually more like a year and a half But anyway He brought with him two cats that he's had for a long time Since 2000 I think I think he got them around October of 2000 And they were about four or six months old at the time Probably fudging some of these details But I wasn't around back then And their names are Maruko and Sanrio And Maruko was a male black cat And Sanrio's a tan cat Female And you know I've grown very close to these cats as well And you've probably heard them referenced on the show sometimes In fact it was really weird Just the other day I was listening to a playback Yes I do listen to OLR once in a while It's a really good way to kind of be a Critic of yourself I was listening to the show a couple weeks ago And I believe Maruko came out Because I heard Jamie like Oh hey Maruko like you were petting him They were very unlike Shirmi Where they don't come out during the shows Because they're very shy And they don't like people She was like already there you can't move her This is my couch You don't like it get out Maruko always pranced around with his tail in the air So I always called him Mr. Priss But he was also very vocal And was a really fun cat And I really have grown to appreciate Maruko And he loves Sanrio's food No doubt You can sadly guess where this is going We got blindsided a little bit The past couple days Maruko started showing some really bad symptoms On Thursday and Friday He just wasn't himself I can't even describe it His meows were different He was always a very vocal cat The way he was breathing was very different as well So I told Alan well of course let's go see the vet Right away We got to the vet's office pretty much thinking Oh you know we just need to get some medication He'll be alright whatever But we get the x-rays back and the news is really bad He had a lot of fluid in his body In places it shouldn't be Basically so much around his lung That it was basically pushing on his lung And he was having a hard time breathing That was causing it Unfortunately A tough decision had to be made And we put him down yesterday And it was What can I say? It was devastating Just the shock of it all Just the fact that this came out Of literally nowhere Even though this thing that he'd been developing Apparently was silently developing for years But even if we had The thousands of dollars to pursue A diagnosis and figure out What was causing it The veterinarian made it pretty clear that It's probably heart failure It's probably cancer I have another friend that just lost a cat to FIP Not that long ago So it's just like It's tough With Shermy she was wheezing When we got back from Disneyland And then I wrapped her up in hot towels For a few days And she perked right back up And then suddenly she just Keeled over But the symptoms sound very serious And it's just like It's just like But the symptoms sound very serious She was having respiratory issues Since some folks in the chat room Are asking at live.vognetwork.com The Maruko was 12 and a half So a little old In kitty ears For an indoor cat Maybe not super old But definitely old enough For complications to start coming in So I don't know what else to say I just want to get that off my chest So that way if I'm gonna sniffle up And not while we're trying to interview somebody Hi Eddie how are you? He was a very good kitty And he sat in my lap a couple times Well you used to cat sit So I know you were one of the first people I called in the parking lot And I was like I'm driving I was actually literally This was at what Florin Mall used to be If you want to know where I was And I was having the thing to pull out Into the street when you called And I was trying to be considerate And I was like okay fine And then it went on to FaceTime I was like oh shit have I been on FaceTime this entire time And turn around and pull in And I had my friend with me And then I just did a circle in the parking lot Anyway I want to try and move on I don't want to dwell on this too much But I do want to address Some of the comments that are in chatroom At live.vognetwork.com Lots of condolences and thank you very much I will pass those along to Alan as well I was only fortunate enough to know Maruko for about 3 years But he did live for 12 and a half Tigerclaw says my condolences Losing a pet is the hardest thing a person could ever go through It is definitely one of the worst Tigerclaw asks how about Sanrio How is she health wise Obviously the plan is When we have money Because yesterday set us back a little bit But when we have some money we do want to go in and get her checked And make sure she didn't contract the same virus That's one of the first things we want to try and rule out She's doing okay She's hard to read right now I think she knows something's up She's kind of looking around Acting a little differently I think she knows something's missing But that's to be expected But she still has some of her playfulness I took a really cute video earlier today Of her playing with a string So you know We'll see We'll try to get her in as soon as we can When we can financially Take care of it Going to some other comments in our chatroom I like this from Breakman it's very good Cats and dogs are such a great part of our life But they are so fragile And their time with us is far too short Ain't that the truth Gamegrew says I'm sorry about your cat I've lost my last cat a few months ago It's tough And especially The suddenness of it all Is tough I want to move on How do we escape from reality By playing video games Well not in my case I drank and cried For a night We haven't quite had that phase Yet and I'm hoping we'll be alright But if we have to have that we will Sometimes it doesn't hit you For a little while Let's talk about video games and some of the other Distractions and things that are better And again if you do want to join us in our chatroom Live.vognetwork.com is the place To be DarkSagra why don't you start us off tonight I have a very happy announcement of something That I've played Mass Effect 3 What a shock The ghost patch Is what we're calling it Because I just decided on a whim To check on it after a fresh boot And it patched something And I'm like really? And so I loaded it and of course it rewrote My hack file which is fine And I I loaded it up And lo and behold I had zero Problems none of the lag none of any of that So I was Quite happily surprised And I Even checked it You know with other people I you know did a bunch of Other stuff to make sure it wasn't just a A You know What's the word I'm thinking of? Not a whim But just a one off Thing and It kept working and so I was like Everyone get a multiplayer right now So I played for a while with Shane and Tim And then I played again With Shane and Tim and Spike the other day And with my friend George And everything was fine I still kind of suck at it But I'm getting better and Got a few levels in did the N7 Challenge thing Fun so you got a banner And I wore my N7 shirt That day and I also went in just to See if it was like a completely new patch So I tried to um to hack my game Again and well more like Hex edit it so that I could get the console to Unlock and the same it's at The same sector it still works so But everyone if you're trying to do The hex edit based on what's on The mass effect wiki it's Not F4 for the last two Numbers it's F3 just letting You know I Did that on screw that up no I did it Because there's no F4 I did I did the F3 on a win because I found the Same sector and it worked so They have it on there wrong So um as I just said Tigerclaw um probably Didn't hear but I can play online again And I went back in on my DLC Works and so that means I'm good To go for Omega but we're calling It the ghost patch because They didn't announce anything They didn't even acknowledge that there Was a problem the only acknowledgement That I got was from Some guy In customer service Who actually worked with me for a long time And he said yeah we're noticing that there's A problem here we just can't say anything else about it Right now oh really I can't say No comment I can't Say anything on that he was He did more for me than the other people Did but It did give me a nice little 30% Off code which I'm going to use for the Omega DLC So I'm very happy And um I played Through Mass Effect 2 I actually did Touch WoW long enough to Log out while I was trying to make Plans with you to go see Silent Hill I completely forgot that I was logged in and Talking to you Did you guys go see Silent Hill? No we still haven't made it out To see it You need to do that BlackWolf has a smart ass comment In our chat room at live.vognetwork.com In response to your fact That the information on the wiki is wrong He says if only it was a wiki And everyone could edit it That means I have to log in for an account on it and I don't Fucking feel like it That means I have to do work Well the other thing And I think I mentioned it last week is now that I have a job Like a real job That's going to pay me some good money Hooray for money That I kind of haven't had much Garris I haven't had a whole bunch of time To really do much except That the good thing about my job is that since I don't usually have to Be in until 9 in the morning I can stay up till midnight and sleep in And so I can actually Because who really feels like Waking up early in the morning and gaming Before work? Seriously? Gaming is something you stay up all night And do. You play games in the morning, Logie? I would if I didn't have to get The baby up I like to stay up all night I don't have children, that's awesome I've stayed up all night and done that still He's not really a baby anymore either He's more of a toddler Just saying At any rate At any rate My schedule has actually been pretty perfect For gaming except that My work environment is so fast paced And I don't get paid days off which makes me a little sad But it's all good That's my work It's in a small office in a house And I have so much freedom For my scheduling and for things that need to happen And I can wear socks I ask permission to wear my fuzzy socks in the office And I can do it It's great. Anyways My work allows me more game time So I will be playing more stuff Awesome. Logie, how was your gaming week? I played Call of Duty Black Ops 2 Yes, I know it's not out yet How's that gonna stop me? When you work in games distribution You can sometimes You know, do things early Anyways, so, got the play Obviously haven't been playing any multiplayer On it, well, no Internet multiplayer because the servers aren't up And also you want to be careful Because everyone, after the whole Halo leaking out a month Early and stuff like that So Been playing mainly the single player campaign And really that's kind of cool Because I haven't played a lot Of the single player campaigns I played a bit of Modern Warfare 3 single player campaign And totally hated it Because they were Really penalizing you with shooting your teammates Not that I'm trying to shoot my teammates But everyone kind of blends in When it's so chaotic and stuff And it seems like Black Ops 2 isn't so At least I'm playing on a super easy difficulty too Because I just really care about the story I don't give a shit about the challenge But You know, I haven't had that problem Where, oh, you accidentally killed a teammate Because, you know, he ran in front of you When you're firing a missile or something like that You know, so that's kind of cool But the story is fucking awesome It's just like, it's really action packed And just, I really enjoy it And that's saying a lot Considering that a lot of times People consider the, like, single player Campaign for these kind of games To be kind of just a throw away It's just, oh, well they have it on there Actually, the single player is pretty awesome Like, and I actually want to check out The first Black Ops game Because I never played it But, you know, obviously carrying on with the characters That they have from the first game But it just, like, for example There's one scene, it kind of flips back and forth Between the past and the future Warfare So, the first kind of future warfare One that you're in, you're kind of swinging along This, it's like a mountainside Or something like that And you're tethered to this other guy And you have these nanogloves that you can grip onto the rocks and stuff And they're scouting out this This base that's, you know, kind of in a temple Or something like that And so, they put on their wingsuits And they fly down there And just that sequence is so fucking awesome It's just, like, I saw them It's like, this is so awesome Does it have, like, 80's metal playing in the background? No, there's no 80's metal playing It's very, like, cinematic Because, uh, Knight, was it Trent Reznor Oh, that's right! It's just really awesome Like, you're flying down there And I know it's not really, like, a quick time thing and stuff I mean, there are some quick time stuff in there But it wasn't that big a deal But, um, it was just really cool And then you get into this, like, secret thing under the base And it's like, oh, it's this, you know, nanobot factory thing That's pretty awesome And then there's also the one that you've seen in the trailer Where you're riding on a horseback And it's one of the flashback missions that you're on But you're playing on a horseback Like, almost the whole mission And it's awesome, because you're just Blowing up tanks with a rocket launcher on the back of a horse And there's, like, helicopters flying over Wait, say that again? Blowing up tanks You're blowing up tanks on the back of a horse You're holding a rocket launcher and riding a horse I swear to God, that was a scene in Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter That was sort of a scene in the commercial Except the girl had grenades But it's just It's so, like, chaotic and awesome It's a really I love it, I love the campaign And it really kind of makes me want to go back and try some of the other Single player campaigns of the different games But just for some reason, this, like, kind of Near future combat stuff is just really Cool, like, the storyline's actually I think really well done So, um, definitely worth checking out I mean, even if you're kind of thinking twice about Eh, it's just another Modern Warfare shooter game Check out the storyline They actually did a pretty good job on it So besides that, played a little bit more Minecraft Been just trying to get, you know, plugins and stuff To work correctly with each other I'm working on finishing up the mob arena stuff So I have this Magic Spells Um, plugin that I added in there But I didn't realize it had a dependent Plugin with this vault thing that I had to install In there, so I'm still trying to get that all worked out And get the permissions set correctly Still kind of new to the whole bucket plugin stuff Um, and then I noticed that One of our other users Hitstun had turned in the Mr. Freeze And had frozen the jungles Everybody chill Seriously Wait a second, why can't I see off the roof of this Mob arena I created What's going on here, is it just not drawing in I realize it's snow Leave it to Hitstun or somebody to bring The League of Super-Villains into the It was an accident He was working with World Edit It's always an accident That's how villains get created Hey, it was easy to fix Joker fell into that vat This is what happens when you play God And it was fixed He was making a snow globe In the nether I don't know how that Got out onto everything else But there's snow in a bunch of the Different chunks there So I had to fix that I thought it was hilarious, there was snow in the jungle Yes, there was snow all over the jungle I was like, this is not right I had to find the corners and then Welcome to the jungle, we got lots of snow So I fixed all that I tried playing a little bit of Curiosity But it wasn't working So that was that And Call of Duty Black Ops Or not Black Ops, Modern Warfare 3 We've been playing multiplayer of that And that's pretty fun I actually played a little bit of multiplayer in Black Ops 2 as well The split screen stuff Actually the split screen stuff Because I was bored, I decided to take on Nine AI characters that were the Veteran difficulty, which is the hardest Because it's AI And you figure out the weaknesses in their Pathfinding and away you go So that was that I forgot one other game I played Very Solitaire That's right because it was free, I played that too It was actually fun For a free game, better than Yaris It was a good time killer I actually had fun with it because I like card games Yeah It reminded me of Neopets I wouldn't have minded paying a little bit of money for it But it was cute I used to play Pyramid Solitaire on Neopets all the time That was a good tip Act F by the way last week Oh and the last thing, one of the things that they've been hyping up About Black Ops 2 is these whole This kind of like strike force missions They fucking suck I hate the strike force missions And the reason why is because they're on the multiplayer maps It's basically kind of like this strategy thing Where you get a bunch of different troops and stuff And you can kind of, okay go here defend this Go here attack this And you can jump into each of them It's supposed to add this kind of strategy element to it The problem is though Is the controlling of that stuff is really terrible And so you're telling your troops to go here And then you're trying to select one soldier And it's selecting all of them It's pain in the ass I found it more efficient for me to go into a soldier And just do the mission myself So that's kind of the only Poopoo thing about Black Ops 2 right now Halo Man in our chat room At live.vognetwork.com says Today's headline, Loki loves a game The Mayans have been proven to be right Dude I love games all the time Grand Theft Auto Hello By the way Halo 4 made me nauseous If you're done with your gaming week I want to quickly talk about mine I don't have a whole lot of time Because we're running a little late for Eddie's interview Because we got a late start tonight But I want to quickly talk about A couple games because I did play some new stuff this week One of them is Halo 4 Yes, me Halo, uh huh, I bought it Keep in mind I've been out of the Halo franchise for a little bit I didn't buy ODST, I didn't buy Anniversary I didn't buy Reach, the last Halo game I bought was Halo 3 And I didn't love Halo 3 Because I didn't have a lot of friends That were online playing the multiplayer And for me that's kind of where it's at in Halo I don't get into the story mode too much So Halo 4 Is kind of a new boot to the series Because it's a new developer It's 343 Industries I'm only through like the first two chapters So I'm not going to try to speak with authority or anything But I will say It's interesting I feel a little lost Because I'm not as familiar with all the backstory And so forth But I can pick up enough of what's going on That I'm not like hating it And at the end of the day The story is really about the relationship between Master Chief and Cortana Any review outlet that's talked about this game Is going to tell you that There's too much more to really get into the series But for me It's always been multiplayer Is where it's at And I've been having fun There's a group of about four of us that have been playing multiplayer online And we've been trying out all the modes You know, King of the Hill, Oddball All the stuff you know from the old games Of course Slayer But there's a couple fun new ones And I gotta say I had a great time playing Flood Which is one of the new game modes Flood, some of you are the Spartans Like the normal guys But some of you become the Flood You become these like creatures that run really fast And have swords And basically it is a Kill the Spartans as fast as you can And then once you kill a Spartan They become a Flood So it's kind of one of those like devour You know everybody as fast as you can And convert them and whoever can survive the longest Ultimately wins But for some random ass reason The creatures make horsey noises Like they go They make these noises like horses When they're dying and stuff It's the creepiest thing in the world And hilarious So for a good time Just add Flood And then there was this other mode we played I think it was like Griffonball or something like that Griffball All the other ones have description And for Griffball it said Just add awesome Something like that So we go in this mode and all it is Is you have the gigantic gravity hammers You can either have a hammer Or a sword And it's just a game of Get the ball into the goal But you have these giant hammers That you're either knocking the ball around with Or the other players And so that shit was really funny actually Even though we got beat bad Like it was Shane and I Versus Spike And Tim It was two on two They wiped the floor with us Like five points to nothing It was depressing But yeah that was a good time I enjoyed myself So if multiplayer is where Halo is at for you Then you're definitely going to enjoy Halo 4 I think The graphics are a step up It's just fun again But keep in mind I've been away from Halo For a good three years I'm sure the story mode is great too You know Everybody says great things about it on the internet But I'm not as into the lore and all that stuff So I'm like okay yeah The presentation is really good There's a pretty cool scene in the beginning Where you're climbing up a wall and it's kind of neat The other game I want to talk quickly about Little Big Planet Karting I picked up on the PlayStation 3 I haven't played a lot of it Because I've been too busy with multiplayer on Halo 4 But I like it It really does feel like a fusion Of ModNation Racers And Little Big Planet Which is to obviously no one's surprise Because it's the same developers of ModNation Racers With all the Little Big Planet stuff in it It controls great It's fun I noticed there weren't a lot of people online to race against I'm not sure what's up with that Maybe because the game is so new and everybody is distracted with Halo 4 I was just on at a weird time But yeah So far I'm liking Little Big Planet Karting But I need more time with it To give you my full opinions The other games I'll talk about real quick Curiosity What's in the Cube I don't think that's really a game We shouldn't call it a game It's just a weird thing They're having those server problems left and right Which is really unfortunate But I like the zenness Of being able to just sit there and Pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop And kind of figure out the way to get Huge combos of coins and so forth I was able to get enough coins You can buy items that will let you break bricks faster See that was a thing the shop wouldn't even open up for me Because it was so lagged out I got this pick That let you do 3x3 Bricks when you would tap And you can rack up your combos so much faster When you do that Doing the little random tappings are much more fruitful When you do that so kind of neat But anyway Curiosity not really a game And they're having a lot of server problems But it's free Bemani better than Yaris Little bit The one other thing I want to talk about Since we are about to have a Bemani-centric interview here in a minute Reflectbeat is out on the iOS systems now And you can get that on iPad or iPhone I've been playing a little bit of Reflectbeat on the iPad I did not know much about this game honestly I've been out of the loop of a lot of the Bemani stuff So you know again It's free you only get 3 songs Because they're trying to sell you the song packs But it was different I want to try some like Versus and try to like play against somebody Because I think that would be where the game would Because there's more of a versus element to it Where if you hit certain notes They'll actually bounce back to the other side And the other player has to hit them so that's kind of neat It was kind of fun A little different Alright anyhow We are going to, I'm running a little late here So I want to get this in here An interview And I'm so happy to welcome to the show Eddie from BemaniStyle.com A long running website about music gaming And music game culture I want to bring him on the line and talk to him about What's going on in the music game world Hey Eddie you there?

Funny enough It actually started Kind of as a result of DDR spot, I don't know if you guys remember that Site or not but some of the old NorCal Players started that up years ago Kind of like a competitor to DDRFreak and Mike No Was in Michigan for a tournament Way back in like 2001 And we ran into each other And got to talking and at the time it was like Me, him The owner of TeamGuilo.net Which was a Canadian site and A friend of mine from the New England Area named Malcolm, we were all talking about making this Just gigantic site To cover all music games Because as it had standed DDR was being talked about Like everyone was kind of ignoring the other games And that wasn't really what I was jiving with personally Because I liked the Five Key stuff a lot And there was A lot of ego that got in the way From the other two sites And nothing bad It wasn't like we were fighting or anything But there were a lot of arguments about the name and everything So Malcolm and I just kind of splintered off And decided to start BemaniStyle You know, on our own And it was an early effort by Me, him, some guys from the Midwest And a handful of people we knew in Japan To just get more You know, word out about the other series that people Weren't playing at the time You've been very successful with BemaniStyle.com Because it's really evolved into a place now where I know for a while you were doing You were doing some type of record distribution Or record stuff, right? I'm still doing that actually It was kind of like a weird situation I did Slakes CD in the US Back in like 2006 And a year later we got in touch with DJ Chucky and the guys from Groovy About bringing them Out to the US to play at Anime Central And that kind of spiraled Into us distributing their albums In North America More Japanese hardcore stuff Not Bemani-centric But ever since we did that we've had M Project DJ Chucky, No Chin, Groovy Chorus K, Red Alice Jackazid Just a number of people have been featured in all these music games Out to Chicago for the Anime Central Show that we do every year So that's kind of like where that project is We're actually right now in the planning stages For our 2013 show So it's still going on Awesome, so that's kind of the place to be as Anime Central If you want to see some of these artists that kind of Started in music games I guess Or I guess maybe known over here From that or whatever you want to say Yeah, that's pretty much it What do you think has kept Bemani Style I mean, you know, we just saw DDR Freak You know, you kind of mentioned that Bemani Style kind of started as a It was meant to be somewhat like DDR Freak But more inclusive of the other music games Well, obviously DDR Spot And before they shut down a long time ago DDR Freak just recently in the past year Finally sunsetted and said You know, party's over How do you think Bemani Style What's kept Bemani Style Above that and In light of these other sites sunsetting Well, I mean, you know, one thing When it comes to running a website Ultimately if it closes that's the decision of the person Who owns the website and quite frankly You know, my feelings on it are Even when I have my low points Which, you know Got us talking, what, a week ago A Facebook post that I made about how The community has been lately Even when I've had my low points I just look at it as though I've been doing this site for 10 years How can you just walk away from something like that Especially when people are still using it So I think it's just a There's a genuine interest from a lot of people Who are really die hard fans for that Information on, you know, the more Global games, stuff that's not released over here And then at the same time there are people who are more Casual that are into maybe Just the music and they like knowing when New songs are coming out, they don't play the Games, they just want to know about the music I think it's a variety of things, but the community's kind of stuck with us And I'm just really not Ready to let it go, so Just sticking with it as long as I can Since you brought up Facebook And all that, where is The community at these days, you think What is the music game community It's split, it's kind of weird because You kind of have splinter groups now In regards to what games people are playing And what mentalities everybody has Konami Has not really been doing a lot to help The community over here in the US They never really have There have been attempts in the past With Beatmania And the home version DDR's that came out Early on and DDR continuing on For years, but ultimately The hardcore fans Kind of get the short End of the stick in the sense that They're very vocal about What they want from the games and Konami Has to kind of Appease both the mainstream And the hardcore fans And I think they lean a little bit too much towards The mainstream and not enough towards The hardcore fans So the hardcore fans have just kind of gotten Sick of it, a lot of them It's just like any other internet community The more negative people Tend to be the ones that stand out more In conversation, as opposed to the people who are Praising the work of the people making the games Or whatever the subject matter is So On the outside it looks As though the community has just Degenerated to this massive Negativity They're just tired of not getting Any of the games and being Ignored and so on and so forth So you run into situations like what's Happening right now with the DJ Max Community, who for the most part Ever since Technica came out have just been Growing at an exponential rate And a lot of them are really fantastic people But you'll see people that Once anything goes wrong or something Doesn't go their way Everyone starts complaining Or starts just outright Talking shit about the company that makes the game Not really looking at it from their perspective But saying like, hey, this is what I want Why aren't you doing what I want you to do And so that tends to stand out over the people Who are a little bit more Positive and understanding about everything So from the outside looking in I think the music game community kind of comes off As though it's not very Welcoming as of late And I've had my criticisms over Just the general Attitudes of people for a long time I think there's still just a ton of love For the games and the hardcore players Are a little bit more vocal about What they expect than the people who play them A little bit more casually Since you were talking about Konami And kind of like the difficult position They've been in for many years Although I don't know, I kind of think that All the United States progress For DDR, anything they had going For it kind of went away when Redmond and Hawaii both went away That was pretty much the end of that, right? I wouldn't necessarily say that I think that From a player expectation A lot of that went away because they lost that connection I mean, when they were doing The games in Redmond especially The guys working on the games Were fans of DDR A lot of them were really old school NorCal and SoCal players So that connection to the community Definitely went away and I think that caused A lot of problems, but I don't think that the momentum Went away, so to speak I think the momentum went away when Konami wasn't really being as Hands-on with certain projects As they used to be So you'd see things like the Wii games Coming out, I think were a fantastic effort I think they did a really good job with those The Xbox and the PS3 versions were kind of Whatever, the song lists weren't fantastic But I mean, they were still very traditional DDR games, so then you look at the arcade side of things And After not ever Making an attempt in North America with the Arcade releases Before Extreme, I mean, there was The original DDR 1.5 in the US And then there was DDR USA But honestly, neither of them were really Valiant efforts on their behalf They kind of ignored everything for a long time And then the In the Groove thing happened And there was a lot of just I think a lot of people really resented Them for that because they felt like If you're not going to do anything, why are you taking away Our only outlet for these games? And then they did Supernova and Supernova 2 Which I personally think were great And those two Like those two games in particular I think were a really good Effort on their behalf, but then X and X2 Came out and it was just letting the wrong People handle the franchise Handle the development of these cabinets And do the release and everything So we got kind of like a shoddy product I mean, not even kind of a shoddy product It was really a shoddy product And a lot of people just Kind of got fed up with it and walked away from it And I mean, I want to clear this up too In regards to the arcade stuff because I know a lot of people bring this up But DDRX2 Kind of had the same problems as DDRX1 Did where they were Lowering the cost of production On the games and you could tell that You know, the quality went down a lot Especially in the dance pads and they made A conscious effort to try To fix the problems from X To X2 because Myself and some friends of mine were brought in To consult with them specifically on the Arcade release to make sure certain things were up to snuff And when we had seen them Everything was functioning Perfectly fine and timing Was fantastic and the games were actually really good quality And X2 as a mix is like one of my favorites In a long time and then Somewhere between when we did our testing Work with them and the actual release Something changed and the Final product that we got just ended up being this Shoddy mess that, you know, constantly Ends up in a state of disrepair and is almost Unplayable Let me go to the chat because there's quite a few comments Going on in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com First off, Shane Olinko Is saying, we worked at Redwood City Not Redmond, oops, my bad, sorry, I was thinking of the Wrong video game company apparently, my bad, my bad Mass effect on the brain? Apparently, apparently YYR saying, I still Believe that Supernova happened because In The Groove happened and a few folks agreeing With him, what do you think? I don't think that that's the case At all actually, a lot of people Look at that because of the timing Of the whole thing, but A lot of people also don't remember What it was like when Extreme came out And when Extreme was in testing They had always been saying that Extreme was kind of like a reboot for them The whole, we're starting all over and You know, kind of giving it a last hurrah On that hardware, but I think a lot of what Caused them to take a break for so long was Just the rampant bootlegging of that game Just all over the world, they were losing So much money on it, so many potential sales And a lot of time Went into developing a little bit More secure of a system And in between The period of time from Extreme to Supernova They had released Dancing Stage Fusion In the UK, which used kind of like the Middleware hardware It was the same hardware that Pop and Music Used, so it was a PS2 based hardware And it didn't use Magic Gate Protection, but it was still pretty Uncrackable, and finally They settled on the hardware that was used Which was basically a PS2 in a box With an IO board that plugged into everything And, you know, had its issues with Hard drives dying and all that other crap But I think a lot of the delay had more To do with them just trying to get a lockdown On the issues with all the bootlegging Since we're talking about like Reboots and all this stuff and where DDR Is heading, you know, this news came up very Recently, even after I asked you to come On the show originally, that is that There is this Dance Dance Revolution Reboot that's location testing in Japan Right now, what do you think about this? Good idea for the series? Bad idea? Not gonna go anywhere? What do you think? Well, I think too many people are Looking at it the wrong way. I mean, just because They went back to naming it Dance Dance Revolution doesn't necessarily mean it's a reboot Um, you know Pop and Music recently lost its Numbering system. They dropped The newest version is Technically the 21st version, but there's no 21 anywhere on the banner And Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania are getting reset as GITADORA, which is basically just like the XG games in a shiny white cabinet And no second player guitar on the Guitar Freaks version. Are you saying that everything's going the way Of Apple, where now it's the new DDR? Uh, well I think that's what people are gonna end up calling it DDR 2013, which is What people are calling it right now, but I think that what they're doing is They're actually kind of going the rock band model With everything, and they're setting it up to be A platform as opposed to being Something that you get yearly upgrades On. They have a new pricing Model for the arcades in Japan that they just Rolled out with the newest BeatMania, where The arcades pay a subsidized rate For the hardware and The game itself, and then Konami Kind of forces a profit share on the game Through their Paselli and EMUsment networks So every month the arcades Give up a certain amount of their profits, but they're Paying so much less for the game as a whole And then throughout the course of the product's Life, they'll upload a bunch of new Songs and add some features To the online network, do more unlock games Or whatever the case may be, and they've already Said that with the new DDR game, they've stated That every Six months or so, they're gonna push out Another 30 or 40 songs and a UI Update and possibly new features And stuff, so I think that this is less Of a reboot and more of a way to Kind of Restructure the way they do things Based on how the arcade market Has been declining everywhere In the world, like it's like a conscious Effort to try to do something that Arcade operators can work with but doesn't Leave them in the hole at the end of the day So this is like The 11th doctor of DDR Kinda, sorta It just sounds like they're forcing them basically to buy An upgrade each year because it's being subsidized Throughout the entire year, and with The good faith that they're actually gonna put out 30 to 40 songs or whatever for the Next update, which, let's be honest Compared to what I've seen with the home Releases and what they support DLC wise That's I'll be interested to see if they actually Continue on with that after at least One update Honestly though, I don't think that that's gonna be the case I don't think the CS games are at all Indicative of what they're doing with the arcade stuff Because they've been doing download content on the Arcade games for a few versions now 2DX18 had Like an add-on patch really really Really late into its life with a bunch of Ubeat and Reflectbeat songs on it and then Linkle came out and Linkle had like 2 or 3 Song updates, so I don't think That they're gonna give up on this And you've gotta look at it from the perspective of They're not really selling them upgrades anymore It's Cutting the cost of production and it's also Cutting the cost of development on these titles So there's no reason for them to not stick with it Because it's constant profit If people are continuing to play the Games, then the operators are gonna Stick with the service and they're gonna stay Subscribed to the amusement network and everything So it doesn't really benefit Konami at all To not stick with it and at the same time It costs them way less in development To do something like this than it would for them To crank out a new game every 8-12 months Like they've done for the past 10 years Of the series existence How does something like that work though For importers over in the US? It's kind of left to be Unsaid right now, I mean they haven't They haven't been making any of the games really available For a while, DDR was available But it was available in such sketchy Circumstances You had to buy, for X and X2 You had to buy a new machine from Betzen And then there were these crap machines that would break down So you'd end up spending more money and repairing The game than you would make back And you would never pay off the machine That happened to a lot of arcades out here In regards to 2DX and Popin' Music And Guitar Fricks and Drummania UBeat and Reflectbeat don't even really exist Over here outside of like 3 locations One of them isn't even an arcade that have a UBeat machine They've never been available Out here as upgrade kits Because historically there just wasn't a lot of interest From the arcade operators For it, like even when they did the location tests For 2DX14 And they did the UBeat location tests down here in Southern California So For importers, it really It's not Changing the situation For them at all Because it's not like people have been importing the games for years anyway I think the last one that was really readily imported As like a legit game Was maybe 2DX Red And that was, I don't know, 2003, 2004 So I don't think it's really going to affect them at all At the same time though I really can't get too much into it But there is some stuff going on In regards to Konami's American Arcade operations That I've, you know, become privy to And it's not really so much of a guarantee As much as it is They're showing genuine interest in getting the stuff out here Because round one Which had just opened up its second location here in Southern California The music games are actually Like hand over fist making more money Than any other arcade games in the location This is including Redemption So they've pretty much put a mandate out That like all of their music games have to be up 100% Of the time and if something goes down It needs to be fixed like immediately Even if the parts need to be ordered from Japan And Konami's kind of latched on to this And they've been shopping They've been shopping the games around There are arcade distributors out here Nothing's, you know, set in stone Or anything like that But ever since they dropped the bets in as their lead distributor They have been making attempts to try to find someone else out here To handle the stuff So it's really just kind of hard to say where it's going to go At this point, you know It's the state of the arcade industry In North America That nobody wants to take risks on anything That's going to cost money And I think that might end up hurting it more Than Konami's unwillingness to release anything Am I to infer from this a little bit That maybe the, you know, we've talked about Arcade, the arcade scene has been hurting For such a long time here in the states At least certainly the way we used to know it Am I to infer from this that maybe music games Are a way to get Quote, quote, I'm using my quotey fingers Real games back in the arcade Well, you know, think back to 10 years ago When DDR first started getting popular in the US Arcades had been dead since You know, Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter 2 So it's I see it as a cycle I see the whole arcade industry as a cycle And not to deviate too much from the conversation But, you know, the arcade industry Just doesn't A lot of the operators are old Older guys, there's a handful of younger guys Who have been starting up their own places But a lot of arcade operators are older guys That just don't want to take risks on stuff anymore So redemption kind of rules That's the king of the arcade space right now Because that's what's making money But there's a lot of laws that have been Brought to light, not really They're not actually laws, but there's a lot of laws that are being Proposed right now to kind of kill the Redemption market because it's essentially Gambling for children If something like that passes, it's going to Cause a huge change in the arcade market But, you know, there are certain Things like, I listened to the last few episodes And you guys are talking about Wreck-It Ralph And I think That the arcade industry as a whole Missed its entire mark with that movie I think that that would have been A perfect chance for them to Maybe appeal to Disney to do some more Cross-promotion and get people out to their locations And bring some life back to the arcades again And nobody capitalized that at all There's always a DVD release Yeah, but, you know, it's still going to be limited At that point, I think it's better to strike When the iron's hot, I went to a movie Theater up here to see it, and they had Like two arcade games in the entire place You'd think that a movie theater who's Expected, and it's like the number one movie in America Right now, like, wouldn't that get You to go to your route operators And be like, hey, get some more stuff in here right away We've got some extra space for you, bring in Like a Pac-Man or bring in a racing game Or something like that Or one of those Wreck-It Ralph cabinets that they made You know, just for fun They're limited, though, I think they only put out like 30 of them Well, why? Why not make more? It wouldn't be that expensive to set something up I mean, if you can run the game on an iPad, then Yeah, you know, it's a promotional thing The game was free on iPad I know you're big on Disney like all of us But the thing about Electronica was that little arcade they had there With all the perfect machines Yeah, well I still think Electronica kind of missed its point A little bit, too I mean, like, I'm really critical of the arcade industry So I'm not really the right guy to talk about something like that That's fine You know, they The thing with the Wreck-It Ralph machines is that They're converted Donkey Kong cabinets So it's not like there's like a Pleather of those available for them to just You know, fix up and clean up And throw the game into I'm sure they worked within their means to get that released So, I mean, yeah, they could hobble Something together and release it But, you know, where I think they really missed the mark And me and a friend of mine was talking about this at an arcade auction Last week Why didn't they make a game based on Sugar Rush? How hard would it be to Throw a skin on a racing game And add in some of the features that were featured In the movie that were kind of talked about with that game And then push it out as an arcade game Like, that's the missed Cross-promotion opportunity of the year right there You know, you market that in Japan With AKB48 doing the soundtrack And you're set Well, it'd be the new maximum tune I swear, I was listening to the end credits Going, is that AKB48? It is AKB48 Well, that was kind of big news in the J-pop community Like, kind of how Perfume being in Cars 2 was You know, they kind of got a lot of people talking I just think they're, I love the movie It was fantastic, but I think the whole industry Kind of missed a lot of points All the cameos were fantastic But I think, you know, people didn't really handle The release of that movie properly I don't think there was enough faith placed in it I got just a couple more questions for you And then I want to go to the chat to see if they have anything I already see a few things popping up here But I've been dying to ask you this for years And this is a very controversial question Within the community, but I have to know What you think about this one being You know, so vested in the community and so forth So, and it's about Guitar Hero Because, you know, and I know this is like Hello five years ago, but When this game took off, there was a lot of people In the community, they thought You know, Konami was robbed of Guitar Freaks And Guitar Hero has just come in And taken all the credit We all remember that review that X-Play did Of Beatmania that was ridiculous Where they said it was ripping off Guitar Hero And all that, do you think Guitar Hero At the end of the day, was it a good thing? Or was it a bad thing? For American fans of Japanese music games? I think Guitar Hero Before Red Octane was purchased By Activision was a fantastic thing For the music game community in the US When the game Before the game was even announced To the public, I got a chance To see it I was hooked up with the guys at Red Octane They brought me in to see it like shortly after In the Groove PS2 launch party And I walked out of that That viewing just completely blown away by it Because it was As far as a music game goes In North America, it was exactly what it needed to be Because it's got enough There for both the hardcore player Who wants to challenge But it's got the music that the mainstream player Can kind of latch onto I still play rock band like crazy So I think that it was a great thing But I think once Activision took a hold of it And then started milking the franchise For everything it was worth The eventual downfall of the whole Band based music game Like all together I think that that was really kind of where they missed Their mark and handled it They didn't handle it right at all But I think initially it was a great idea And it's not really like Konami was robbed of it They knew the game was coming out And they made the conscious effort not to release it And a lot of people don't remember this either But back in 2000, Guitar Freaks was slated for release In the US, I still have a receipt Some here in all my random music game Collectibles for a pre-order that I placed at FYE in Cleveland, Ohio Back in like, I want to say March of 2000 for that game And then it got cancelled like last minute Well I remember playing the arcade version All the time, the US releases You know, and What was it that someone was telling me When I was still playing it Oh yeah, I got my pre-order in Basically what you were saying But I remember when we got contacted For them to do something for the local news For Guitar Hero At my house and they made me hide My Guitar Freaks stuff I think that's more of like a Lawsuit issue than anything else You know, Activision did kind of go Not Activision, but Red Octane went around that whole issue The right way They worked with Konami to get the licensing cleared For the release on that, unlike Some previous music games have been done So that's kind of weird to hear Now I don't think Konami was really robbed of anything I think that, you know, that was their fault For not releasing the game when they had the opportunity And really grabbing hold of that market early on Absolutely Especially if they were, if Red Octane was working with Konami over the licensing then They saw, they had their eyes open the whole time Well yeah, and that's why Konami ended up Producing the arcade cabinet Part of the licensing agreement That they had for that game Was that Konami would take over the rights to produce And, you know, build the arcade cabinets For that title Max Ninja in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com Guitar Heroes 1, 2, and 3 are the best Guitar Hero games After that, it just sucked I wouldn't even really say Guitar Hero 3 was that great That was still never soft It was better than any of their other offerings But I still wouldn't say that it was like The top tier of the franchise It was definitely the cliff teetering game Where it's like, oh, here we go, we're on our way down Yeah, pretty much I was gonna say, I wonder what part of the agreement Between Activision and Konami That they decided that they're gonna put out a really terrible Music game called Rock Revolution And then help the sales of Guitar Heroes The stories I could tell you That I've heard about that one Cause I know guys that worked on that on both sides In America and Japan And the guys in America were like Gung-ho, they wanted to make this The best effort they ever possibly could have And I don't know if you guys Ever played the drum portion of that game With the actual controller But the drum controller that they made for Rock Revolution Is the best Retail drum controller That comes packaged with one Like it's better than the Guitar Hero Drum controller, it's better than the Rock Band Drum controller, it was awesome But they produced so few of them Like nobody really got a chance to get a hold of those But one of the stories that I had heard about that game Was that the guy who started that whole project In Japan Was actually doing it as like a quote unquote Revenge project Against the companies in America That had put out these rock games And I don't really know What his meaning of revenge was Like was it to release a really bad game And punish the fans or was it like To try to put something out that would Take all the sales That sounds like Wile E. Coyote kind of revenge Where he builds the elaborate Trap only to have a blow up in his face Pretty much We obviously Would not be able to get through an interview with you Without talking at least a little bit about DJ Max I have loved music games For a very long time When OLR went through It's creative shift a few years ago We kind of opened ourselves up to the different types of games I have not been following the DJ Max News as rabidly as I was The earlier Konami series Although when I saw The Technica machine in the arcade I thought it was a good time And I know there's a lot of stuff that they've been trying to do With the Vita and so forth What do you think maybe an old school music game fan Like me who's kind of turned away From that scene a little bit What do you think Maybe I should be looking at in DJ Max? Why should I maybe come back and Give DJ Max a look? Well it depends on which one you're going to play If you're going to play Technica Then that's kind of like a whole different can of worms Than if you're going to play the portable games Which obviously would take a little bit of Importing and dusting off your PSP I think with DJ Max As a franchise There's a lot of people out there that know that I work for Pentavision So I don't want anyone to think that this is like a Company shill kind of thing here My attraction to the DJ Max franchise Is kind of the same attraction that I have To Konami's Bimani games And that's the music that they use In the game It's a lot of original producers Producing stuff under different genres And there's a lot of variety to the music In and of itself My attraction to music games personally Has a lot less to do with the gameplay And a lot less to do with the music that they use So that's kind of where I think the strong point of the DJ Max franchise Is that they really have like a Very very diverse Song list across all of the games Whereas a lot of the Konami games Shy of pop and music stick with the genre That is kind of reflective of the gameplay Itself, so 2DX is a lot of Electronic music, Guitar Freak Syndrome And he has a lot of rock, so on and so forth Now DJ Max has got everything from Like hip-hop to R&B to like A plethora Of electronic genres And you know Hard rock music, punk rock music Hardcore Classic, I mean like it's That's really where it shines for me The gameplay in Technica If you're speaking of that specifically It's different You know there's a lot to it that's similar to the other games But the whole touchscreen interface And the way that the interface of the game itself Functions is different And it was kind of fresh at the time that it came out Obviously it's been you know 4 years since then But it's very fresh Compared to a lot of other music game interfaces Out there and it's not too hard to Pick up and just the way That you interact with the game is very fun So I would say you know if you're a fan Of the music that's what you should be looking forward to The most because there's just a ton of Really fantastic music in those games Alright well we've had Eddie on like way longer Than we said we were going to have him on But if he's down with it I want to get A few questions from the chat room out So live.vognetwork.com is the place to ask your questions Let me ask this one That was asked earlier from DasBacon Who asked You got a left check I'm going to say beforehand by the way He's my roommate and he works on the website So his question is kind of like a midpoint Loaded question alright I'll ask it anyway since I didn't know that And I thought it was a good question What is the future of Bomani Style? Well we're just Kind of keep pushing forward really We had a huge server outage earlier In the year and It caused us to lose all the Original data It's still out there it's not like the Original hard drives died or anything like that But we don't have access to the server that the site used to be Hosted on due to a complication with our old host So You know there was like a good Six months or so where I Just kind of gave up on everything And nothing was getting done But just recently you know I've got That bug again and I've got a few people helping us out And we're going to just kind of push Forward in getting the most Recent version that we had been developing For like the past two years finished and online With the resources that we have available And people will start seeing that soon With the headline section rolling out We've got a new machine location database On deck Score trackers For just about every single game out there I mean even ridiculous stuff Like pop and stage will have a score tracker on the website We're going to do Like a greatly expanded Sim file database because that was like one of the most Popular things we had on the site with New sorting options and just like A lot better ways to promote Your files than what we had Before because there was a lot of really Good stuff that would just get hidden amongst like A sea of crap and That's one of the things we definitely want to change This time around once we get that going Legend of Zaku wants to know is the Bimani Land Ranch still open? We moved From the Bimani Land Ranch Now we live in what we call the Bimani Land Resort Second style It's a The old house was a ranch house in Anaheim California and it was just a really big place And we had like 30 arcade cabinets there And the new house It's not as open to the public as it used to be Just because of space and we sold off some of the machines But we still have all of the key machines You know we keep them updated And now we have a pool A hot tub and a koi pond And a nice atrium so it's like a Really kind of a relaxed place to hang out It's still open If you contact me via

place If you guys come down here And not hang out at my house Let's see Shane Olinko Is asking a question I'm young and cheek but I'll ask it anyway Because a lot of people always kind of want to know How do I break into the industry How can I get hired at Pentavision I don't even know if this is the one you can answer I honestly don't even know man I got hired on accident Like honestly speaking I got brought in With a bunch of friends of mine To consult for Technica 2 When it first came out and we were helping them With the Technica 2.5 Project that never actually ended up happening And in one of the meetings They were basically staying They really liked Or they appreciated all the help that we were giving them And were like well we wish we could compensate you some way And I was working for this just Awful bankruptcy law firm Doing all their online marketing and I was just like Give me a job, get me out of my job And it's cool, I'll do all this stuff for free And they brought me on Nice So you just got to beg and ask a lot Well it wasn't really Like a begging kind of situation They put it on the table first I just said hey hire me And it just ended up working out that way You know Pentavision is a company Here in the US specifically They're really in tune With the fans, they like listening to input A lot and they really feel bad When they do something that ends up disappointing People So really it's just a matter of like I'm sure Whenever we end up hiring Which isn't really something we have on deck right now But whenever we end up hiring I'm sure The doors will be open to members of the community Who are passionate enough that have the skills To want to work with us So I guess just keep an eye out on the Pentavision Global website If we ever throw up any job postings Give us a contact Let me ask this question from somebody They didn't change their nickname so I'll just call them 693 Because that's the number they got What do you think is the future What do you think is the future of console Rhythm music games And he follows up and says specifically Ronnie CS games but I'm kind of interested In the general sense What do you think is the future of console music games In North America I really couldn't even give you An honest answer The market in the US has Just proven itself to not be there Especially as of late Harmonix has a good thing going with The Rock Band 3 setup The game doesn't need anything else added to it So just cranking out new songs is perfect For their existing user base And Dance Central Dance Central and Just Dance Those will probably continue to be Yearly games just because of the necessity Of releasing them on a disc There's a lot of data that goes into The moves and choreographing The characters and stuff So I'm sure those will continue to be on disc But as far as hardcore music games I can't be 100% certain Of this and I know I'm gonna Break wide open Some news here but Konami didn't show DDR at E3 This year and when I Had asked them about it they had stated That it was because they wanted to take the franchise Back to the drawing board and figure out A new way to do it that could Cross both types of rhythm Gamers I've wanted to pitch that I've been talking about that for a long time Well they clearly stole it from you Damn it I wanted to pitch something that was a cross Between Dance Dance Revolution and Dance Masters Basically kind of like what Dance Central is So you've got some of the appeals to arcade fans Some of the appeals to like Just Dance stuff and then also on top of that Have some sort of I had envisioned This kind of revolution adventure Kind of taking their adventure mode But way beyond where they had it Alright let the man finish I want to hear E3 gossip So anyway They had told me that they wanted to take it back to the drawing board I don't really know what that meant And this wasn't really a confirmation from them But through a mutual friend of mine Or ours I should say I found out Maybe Three or four weeks ago That right around E3 I think maybe two weeks beforehand That Naoki had quit Konami And it's speculative on my behalf But I would not be surprised If that had something to do with the delay In the game this year because he was the one That was heading up that entire project So I know since then Things have been handed off to U1 Who's heading up DDR 2013 In the arcades But yeah As far as the US goes I really couldn't say It's too hard to tell I mean Pentavision we're releasing DJ Max Technica Tune soon But realistically We're just not sure How it's going to sell because the Vita Is not a very widely performing Platform right now And it's been really hard To market that game as a result of some of the Contracts we have in place with our worldwide Partners so the word hasn't gotten Out about that title enough In terms of Japanese music games I don't My honest opinion is I don't think they really Need to do console versions for them Anymore because they have the arcades And I think that when you do A console version of a game that is primarily An arcade game like it is over there You're just taking Activity away from the arcades at that point And so it's not to say That I don't think Konami will ever do another Console music game because obviously they're doing You know Ubeat and Reflectbeat on the iPad But I don't think that they really need to do The console games I know that a lot of North American fans hate me for saying that And it definitely feel like they're owed Those console games but that's not the way The market works in Japan and since the games Are primarily Japanese I think that You know that's just kind of the state of Where they're at But without the console version of DDR how will I make my Data See they made that really Crappy flash utility For DDRX in the US And a whole five people used it So I'm sure there's Ways around it it's not like people aren't clever There's a guy out there that wrote a utility That lets you create edits in StepMania And then export them as data that you could use in the Arcade cabinets so People in the Bimani community are way too Clever for their own good sometimes See I know what the solution to everything is To Para Para Dance Masters is though I actually like Dance Masters Because of the Para Para Well Dance Evolution came out as an arcade cabinet in Japan And apparently it's one of those Games that's not talked about widely but they get regular Updates with new songs So it's still kind of doing Well I guess and it you know that was one of the Questions that I asked Naoki when we talked at E3 a few years ago when Dance Masters Had been first released I said you know I noticed that Night of Fire is in this game And just you use the original Routine for it Is this influenced by Para Para At all? And he was like no No I worked on Para Para but it's not the same game But it's Para Para it's essentially like the Connect version of Para Especially since they opened the old location of Valfar up as Nikufar You know the Para Para scene is coming back so Yeah well they never really died It just kind of like shrunk and now it's Expanding again so You know it's just one of those things I guess Maybe when it gets big enough To make them make notice again And it's got like a type of music that it Latches onto once again because I think I don't know if like the Hyper Or was it Hyper Techno stuff I don't know if that's Still really as relevant as it was a few years ago But I think if they latch onto A new style of music and it becomes popular In the mainstream of Japan again you could possibly See another Para Para game get released Well Eddie you've been a really good sport On the show tonight I know we Said we'd have you on for about 20 minutes We're closer to 40 almost 45 now So I want to thank you for taking the extra time On the show tonight before we wrap up there is A question I always ask all the guests that come on The show what are You playing these days and it doesn't even have to Be music games unless it happens to be music games What video games are you into right now?

What else are people Going to draw on the screens? Like I'm going to have a video chat with Loki and I'm going to draw a big dick Right next to his head and it'll be hilarious I think that Photo I took at Fry's spells it out Which one is this? The one where I walked by the monitor and there was a big Dick on it that someone drew Of course So yeah they have that stuff Also they're saying that That I guess people can Place calls to each other through the Wii U chat And there's going to be a light on the gamepad They'll blink to indicate that there's an incoming Call or something like that It just sounds like it's very basic stuff that they're Just describing in a very complex way that You know makes it sound like Oh hey look we've got video chat on our system Now that everybody's had This for years now but hey it's a new thing And it's cutting edge because We're now doing it And then of course also They have the new Mii Plaza Which is now Mii Wara Wara Or Wara Wara Plaza which I guess Wara Wara means bustling In Japanese Was it Wara Wara? Yes. Yeah that's going to change for the US Yeah it's Well actually apparently The English name will be the Wara Wara Plaza I'm fine with that Which the distant cousin of Wuhu Island Which why can't it be Mii Plaza? Or the Wii U Plaza Or the home screen Or something like that Why does it have to be something ridiculous? No it should be Mii Gusta But anyways Yeah so it looks like Basically your Mii Plaza that you had had On the Wii Now there's titles that You may have played in the Wii U games And stuff like that that they're huddling around Which I don't know I'm not that excited about But whatever Not for me and also Like they said before This is going to be a day one download so It won't actually come on your system So if you don't have connection to the internet Obviously you're not going to have any friends that are going to be on there Well if you don't have a connection to the internet you're probably not Going to be hearing this show Well you may have a connection at work Or something like that I'm just saying You may not have a connection to the internet at home Or you know your console May not be in an area Maybe you're in the dark ages and you don't have A wifi router or something like that Or it just doesn't work through Your walls or something You may have connectivity issues Either way So you're going to have to download this as a day one And I believe the internet browser Is going to be part of that So Well Moving on into other news About Valve I know we're all excited about whatever Valve's got Going on next even though we have no idea what it could possibly be Although I think we're all hoping it's like Half Life 3 Maybe Gabe Newell apparently got a visit This past week from A bunch of users from 4chan.org Uh oh But the Vboard Specifically went to go visit Gabe Newell For his birthday That's pretty hilarious And asked him some questions And of course there's YouTubes of it all over the internet Newell did say no Half Life 3 questions So that wasn't out there But that doesn't mean they couldn't get some other questions Such as is Valve working on a new Source engine And Newell said we've been working on a new engine stuff for a while There was some Garbled audio with subtitles that say We've just been waiting for a game to roll it out with And uh There was another question asked saying Is it more than just an extension to Source Like is it an entirely new engine And Gabe Newell said Yeah Apparently the rumor mill's still Pumping out there on Source 2 This is after the uncovered code in August Wouldn't Source 2 be awesome For like you know launching a console That they would be making themselves Perhaps with a game called Half Life 3 That would sell a lot of consoles Or you know whatever they're gonna be I want Half Life Ponies Well the game they are making is Ricochet 2 That was something that Gabe Newell did confirm Is in development Maybe that's the first game on the engine That could be the game for 2014 Who knows Alright let's move on with some more news Dark Sakura Oh Square Oh Square We need sad music I don't know What about Aerith dying music Alright we can do Alright I'll get some sad music But that's happy music for me Aerith living Aerith living Aerith living music I don't know Yeah well Aerith dying music was happy for me Because I hated her Should just be the sound of the sword Shink shink Ten hours of That's better That's better So Final Fantasy 14 Has come to an end Dun dun dun And um Yeah instead of Some of the stuff that people were promised What they had was basically Server farting They got a really nice cinematic I'm just imagining I'm just imagining actual Literal server farting This is the end Oh well this is Unexpected You shouldn't be making fart noises Over this very sad song This is happy music Remember vote for us at the podcast awards Yay she's Dead awesome My favorite part My save file still works by the way Anyway People were basically Logging on you Those few loyal Deluded people who were still Into the game Hey I have friends that were still playing Final Fantasy 14 You like what you like I can't make fun of anybody this week Because I've popped so many squares On that curiosity cube I can't judge anybody I'm sorry What was the line from Money Python?

The latter, reborn is replacing it and yes, 14 is dead now There is this gap happening and YYR mentions it a little earlier in chat with, what did he say? They're really going to have to start over Shouldn't they have wanted to at least retain the small audience they had? They are hoping they'll come back and I think the ones that were loyal to 14 until the very end I think they will come back I mean, for them to have held out on that game that long they'll come back Here's my prediction for the whole thing I'll come back when they make 11 free to play I'll withhold judgement until I see it You know, if 14 the real one which is really what this is now I know they're calling it reborn but they want us to see it as Final Fantasy 14 No, really this time If it's a good game, then it's a good game and I've got to play a good game, right? We'll see Alright, anyhow, moving to Japan and the releases over there there's quite a bit over there as well Assassin's Creed 3 gets its Japanese release on the 15th Some Platinum Collection titles Dance Central connects sports, including Season 2 and what they call the Ultimate Collection which is both Need for Speed Most Wanted gets a Criterion release, Nike and Connect Training and Steins Gate Hiyoko Ruri no Darling also gets a price reduction as well so lots of price reductions and Assassin's Creed 3, just in time for the holidays. On the Playstation 3 also Assassin's Creed 3 Need for Speed Most Wanted and Dream Club Complete Edi Pion gets a release that's from D3 on the Playstation 3 Going to the handhelds on the Playstation Vita, Assassin's Creed 3 Lady Liberty is there, as well as a Need for Speed Most Wanted release and some new Vita packs are coming out the 3G Wi-Fi model in Cosmic Red and Sapphire Blue I remember reading about those earlier those are finally seeing their release in Japan this week so if you've been waiting for that pretty blue PS Vita, Shane, there it is On the 3DS Aikatsu Cinderella lesson comes out I don't know what lesson they'll be teaching Clean the toilets! Change the firewood! It's a game to teach you how to clean your house That'd be hilarious On the 3DS Clean your house, or else no man will love you Stop it Unchained Blades Exiv comes out Inazuma 11-123 Endou Mamoru Densetsu and Monster Hunter 3G gets a price reduction that might be of interest to some people Now, I'm looking at this and I don't think this is like Cinderella like the fairy tale This girl dressed up in the little Playboy bunny outfit and pink skirt, that's not what I think of and I think of Cinderella It looks like overtly shoujo manga style Yeah, so I don't think Disney Cinderella I'm thinking something else Isn't the lesson still the same? Cinderella's lesson was if you want that man you go get him And you take lots of drugs so you think that you're being met by fairy godmothers There's no Q 16th we have Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed and Sims 3 The Seasons You know what? I quit Sims 3 after World Adventures because I had way too much custom content that it lagged my game It was really El Cubo is the re-release of the GameCube, the Latin America version For England Well they like to mix it up a bit Somehow I don't think that's Castilian Spanish Hey, I may be an expert in Spanish but that sounds pretty sound to me El anything is Spanish It could be Portuguese It could be Or it could be Moving On With More News, the classic game of the week coming up real soon Alright As I kind of alluded to earlier with the need to sell some of those combo packs for UFC THQ is not doing real well In fact you may remember that a while ago they actually had unsplit their stocks, a reverse stock split, 10 to 1 taking all their, you know, 51 cent share stocks and combining them together to equal $5.16 share stocks You know, because their stock price fell so low that it was going to be delisted Problem is Now their stock has dropped down to $1.74 42% So If you think about it those stocks really wouldn't be worth crap They'd be worth like $0.17 Good times Good times, yeah So that is unfortunate And of course I'm sure it's not helping by the fact that a lot of those games have kind of You know, oh I'm sorry It closed down to $1.50 It dropped even further So 50% It's probably not helping that a lot of the games that they were going to be coming out with have been delayed I understand why they're doing it It's admirable but at the same time I'm kind of wondering Damn, I hope you guys survive all these delays Well what's interesting, Legend of Zaku in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says Seriously, they'll be dead in six months But Shadow Next Gen follows that up with people said that six months ago That's true, and the whole thing now is that they want to focus on quality, which is great So South Park, Metro Last Light, and Company of Heroes 2 have all been delayed to the next fiscal year So that doesn't necessarily mean that they're not coming out, it just means that they're delayed a few months because originally this stuff was supposed to come out in the first quarter of 2013 and even as I alluded to they were saying When I joined THQ, the company made a public commitment to the quality of titles and we've always expected that in some cases this would mean that more time would be needed to make sure that every title is of the highest possible quality and our fourth quarter releases are the first titles that I have that have the ability to materially impact an experience told me that games needed additional development time to be market ready Thank you for releasing games that are polished as opposed to just putting them out there because eh, we won't make money So let's hope that that actually pays off and these games are even better than what they would have been had they just put them out when they were ready to put them out So we'll see However, that's still not helping the fact that they defaulted on their 50 million dollar loan that they had with Wells Fargo So, not too good Sad trombone Yes, so apparently they had borrowed I guess 21 million dollars from the credit that they had and I guess they had like this 50 million dollar revolving credit and yeah, not good so Hopefully they will be able to recoup from all these losses and stuff and put out some good games I mean after all, South Park looks awesome I'm not a big fan of Company of Heroes but Metro Last Light looks pretty sweet And you need a Saints Row 4 Right? That's what Rama in our chat room just said Rama in the chat, they better give me my Saints Row 4 before they go down like the claims Saints Row, you know what they were planning to do with that, the whole enter the dominatrix thing, which to be honest looked like shit I would have still bought it, but it still looks like shit but they're making a fourth game that's supposed to be better but at the same time they're saying they're kind of incorporating all the stuff that was going to be in Saints Row you know, enter the dominatrix so it makes me worry that Saints Row 4 is going to just kind of feel like an expansion on 3, which not different enough for me, but I still will buy it because I like Saints Row but I will still be pissed off if it's just a cash grab like the other games have been, but hopefully they kind of learn from their lesson, or didn't learn from their lesson because they made a lot of money off of all the DLC Alright, let's move on to some announcements from Blizzard, who also had an earnings call this week, Starcraft 2 Heart of the Swarm, this expansion they've been working on for quite a while is finally due out in the first half of 2013 that's according to Mike Morhaime, who is the head of Blizzard, he did make that announcement during Activision's earnings call, saying that they are quote, working hard towards a first half 2013 launch, that wouldn't be too surprising to anyone who's been following Blizzard for a while, they put out two big games this year already between Diablo 3 and Mists of Pandaria, so them holding onto this for 2013 is no surprise at all, I would think though it's going to happen after the end of the fiscal quarter to give them something to buoy up the next fiscal year, but we'll see we'll see, speaking of Diablo 3, they have surpassed 10 million sold, and it was confirmed to I'm sure no one's surprise an expansion for Diablo 3 is in the works, I'd be very curious to see how that expansion does though, because let's not forget a lot of those Diablo 3's, well, maybe that's not I was going to say a lot, but it's more like a million came through that annual pass, and I guess 1 million out of 10 million still 10% is pretty you know, but I'd be very curious Diablo 3 hasn't exactly had the warmest reception either, it has its fans, certainly, but I just don't hear about it the same way I heard the enthusiasm for Diablo 2 and I know some Diablo fans might want to challenge me on that, and that's fine, but I just I don't hear that same enthusiasm that I heard behind part 2 so I'd be very curious how an expansion is going to do for them, but I'm sure it would be as well received as Starcraft 2 I mean, Starcraft 2 also, you know it's popular, but not popular like Starcraft 1 was does that make sense? I don't know also, a class action lawsuit being filed against Blizzard you know, they make World of Warcraft Starcraft, Diablo 3, and it has to do with the authenticators apparently who are the guys that are filing this lawsuit here? it's Carney, William Bates, Pullum and Bowman PLLC they are litigating Benjamin Bell et al. versus Blizzard Entertainment, saying that all of this is negligent and deceptive practices related to Blizzard's customers' account security the fact that for a while you had to buy a keychain authenticator for $6.50 technically you still do have to buy that authenticator if you really want to protect your account however, what I'm not hearing about in this lawsuit is, oh yeah, there's the free one on the smartphones and so forth. Don't they have a PC app now? I don't think so, just on smartphones maybe, I don't know I've had the smartphone one for so long, I don't know the claim is drawing against the August 9th battle net breach where Blizzard, they actually disclosed that yes, people got in they didn't get any sensitive information but were making people reset their passwords anyways, and the lawsuit saying that Blizzard's negligence in maintaining proper security protocols is resulting in deceptive upselling so in other words, because Blizzard can't protect their shit, or is negligent in protecting their shit, they're selling you an authenticator so that they're making you buy this to protect your shit. That's gonna get thrown out because honestly, my I've had an authenticator for years and it hasn't done a damn thing for anyone getting it and getting any information that had, the authenticator had nothing to do with it it wasn't like, I think that they got encrypted data was it nothing solid? And it was anything that could have been changed immediately that wouldn't have changed his present level of security. Well, here's the thing though I mean, as much as I do think I agree with you, it's gonna get thrown out of court but I would like to know why were so many Blizzard accounts hacked before authenticators before the mobile authenticator came out? Because there was about a year gap where you only had the $6.50 ones, and as a Warcraft player, I did feel like why are they making me buy an authenticator when they can't protect my shit? You know, and I was like why are so many people getting hacked? What happened here? How did all our passwords get out? I kinda would like that to come to light I would like to know, how many million people have had to call Blizzard because of an account breach? Granted, I think that the authenticator was more put out as something that was for peace of mind because I've done remote work where I had to have an onsite authenticator to get into the server so it's basically an added layer of protection on user side. I think that it doesn't really matter how much security you have on the website. If someone wants to get in, they're gonna get in. So this basically just gives you an extra layer. If anything, I would think that the authenticator price was just to cover the cost of the actual authenticator I don't think they were actually profiting off of it because it was something that required having a device in your hands to basically pair the random numbers with so it's not like something that you obviously, once smartphones came out to the masses and everything like that, they could do an app instead but that's probably why they had to sell it in the first place because they don't want to lose $6.50 on every single one they send out for people. Granted it didn't seem to help for it. They should have just included it in the collector's edition though I don't know, I don't understand why they just didn't include it. Did they do that actually in some of them? No. I thought that they had one of the expansions that had an authenticator in there. I don't think it was Warcraft. Might have been Starcraft, but I don't remember. I don't know, they were just handing them out at cons. Yeah, but that's different. Alright, anyhow, we need to take a time back into classic gaming and classic games history and remember when things weren't so simple and so much shit was getting hacked. At least I don't think this game ever got hacked. It stole your credit card information. It's the classic game of the week. Every week DarkSakura goes into the vault and finds a classic game that she thinks, hey you little brats. This one smells like rotten fruit. Play this game or I'll kill you. Get off my lawn. Go play a game. I'll kill you like you're Eris. Eris. Hey, even in Wreck-It Ralph they got it right. Murica. In Murica we say Eris. Alright, what is the classic game of the week? Super Pac-Man. I like this one. I'm surprised I haven't done it because I actually really like Super Pac-Man. Actually the thing that I linked is basically someone figuring out the ghost patterns in the game. And totally manipulating a full game. But anyway in Super Pac-Man it was the second game in the series that was actually done by Namco. Ms. Pac-Man was done by Midway. So this is a true Namco sequel but you know people didn't really care for it as much because it changed the gameplay really radically. It actually in the game you actually went around and ate fruit. Instead of the little power pills. And then you did get special pellets. You had your regular power pills which you could use to eat ghosts. You had keys that you could get to unlock doors so that you could get to the fruits inside. And then you had super pellets. And if you got the super pellet then you would turn into Super Pac-Man and could go through doors and fly over everything. And you had a button that would make you go faster. On top of that there was a little neat, I thought it was a neat little effect where the ghosts would kind of flatten down a bit to make it look like you were really flying over them. Now you could not eat a ghost as Super Pac-Man but if you ate a power pill like a regular power pill while you were in super mode then you could eat ghosts. The big thing about that is you also had bonus levels too after every second level. Where basically you just try to go through and eat the fruit and everything as fast as you can. With this one it's actually one of the first Pac-Man games that used the Motorola 6809 processor. The previous one used the Z80. And so this went into the same category as Galaxian for the conversion class. However, it didn't really prove to be very successful because it was actually very different than the usual gameplay. It was kind of fucking weird actually. It was. Pac-Man Plus which was just an updated version of the original I mean kind of like Ms. Pac-Man basically outsold it. Midway also did Junior Pac-Man which also went on the old Z80 processor and that one also went to be a very successful Pac-Man game. However, they do say that the AI for Super Pac-Man is one of the best of that time. Super Pac-Man has been out on a lot of different systems. In 84 there was a port for the Atari 5200 but it never came out because the video game crashed. Why is he eating shoes in this level? You don't eat shoes. I don't know. I get the donuts and the burgers and the apples but shoes? Don't eat shoes. Leather. In 1988 there was a Dawson Commodore 64 version that came out by Thunder Mountain. Did you have this file? F yeah. In 96 it showed up on the A for the Namco Museum arcade compilation on the Playstation. In 98 it came out for Namco History volume 3 and that was on the PC in Japan only. In 99 Super Pac-Man was released with Ms. Pac-Man in Ms. Pac-Man Special Color Edition for the Game Boy Color. I had that. I played the crap out of it. 2006 there was a plug and play Super Pac-Man that included that along with Pac-Man, Pac-Man Plus, and Pac and Pal which honestly Pac and Pal is seriously not one of my favorites. It also came in the TV Games Pac-Man Gold edition and the Retro Arcade. Namco has also done a portable version for cell phones that come out on that are put out by Sprint. Sprint and Namco actually had a sweepstakes where you could win a Volkswagen new Beetle customized Super Pac-Man art and it was on display at E3 in 2006. Do you remember this? The Beetle with the Super Pac-Man stuff? I do. Yeah. It ended on July 31, 2006. There was a Palm PDA version that was Super Pac-Man at Handango. Whatever. There was another release with Pac and Pal, Pac and Roll, and Pac-Mania on Namco Museum Remix. Super Pac-Man is now out on mobile films with 3D graphics and better sound effects. And then we have it on the Namco Museum Virtual Arcade for Xbox 360 that came out in 2008. So there you go. Super Pac-Man. There it is, your classic game of the week, Super Pac-Man. I liked this one, even though it was really weird. It was weird. I liked it. You know how I feel about weird. I love that cut scene. He's like, grin. Where a giant ball of Pac-Man falls on the ghost, they turn blue and squish. Don't eat mushrooms! Some of them are poisonous! But what if they're shiitake? Shiitake are delicious. I guess that's alright. I made the best dinner that was shiitake mushrooms, enoki mushrooms, and, um, I can't remember, but there are these other little mushrooms that kind of join at the base and you have to cut the base off. It was so good, anyway. The front lawn mushrooms. No, not front lawn mushrooms. Alright, anyhow. Alright, Super Pac-Man, your classic game of the week, in a million different Namco collections, as Jamie mentioned there a little bit ago. We're actually not taking a break tonight. We have another interview, and this one's prior taped. This is actually coming to us from DJ Rama S, and Anime Jam Session, which is a show you can hear at the Voice of Geeks Network, or vognetwork.com, on Tuesday nights, replaying on Thursday mornings, and at a recent convention, Rama got this interview with Jen, and she is with the website, I don't want to mess this up, it's ggvogue.com ggvogue.com That is girl gamer vogue, and Rama is gonna ask her in this interview some questions about the website, and why she started it, and all that good stuff, so take it away. DJ Rama S will be back after this interview with more of Orange Lounge Radio. It's about a ten minute interview, so we'll be back after this. Absolutely, we definitely try to get girls from all over the tri-state area to kind of just get together, to meet other girls, to find other venues and genres that they play with, and just to have an atmosphere and a community that they feel pretty proud and comfortable in. Our number one passion and mission is to just provide a wonderful atmosphere for girl gamers and empower and inspire them actually, because ultimately, we girls need that community, we need to find other girls who play games and just play. That sounds pretty cool, so what made you come up with this whole idea? To be honest, I've been gaming ever since I was like five. I remember having an NES and just playing it, and it was actually taken away from me by my uncle, but I was really a hardcore Sega fan. I'm a hardcore Sega fan, up until the Dreamcast when it actually kind of just fell off the face of the earth. I mean, now they're more of a software company, but I always realized and remembered feeling that I never had a girl that I could always play with. I went to an all-girls school, up into high school, and I never had the companionship, and I saw that the world lacked that, a place where you could find that companionship. It's like, yeah, you can go to forums, but there isn't a specific venue that you can kind of just find a girl that is looking for a Guild Wars 2 Guild mate, or even if it's just Call of Duty. That sounds pretty cool. So what makes Girl Game Evolved different from other female gamer clans like the D20 girls or something like that? It makes it kind of different. Well, we're not a clan, per se. We're a means to an end, if anything. If you're looking for a clan, if you're looking for a friend, we're the place that you would go to in order to find that clan. So you're pretty much like the liaison to connect other gaming girls to other groups and clans and teams and so forth. Okay. I mean, the website is pretty much kind of like a magazine. We do previews and reviews of games. We do video games psychology, so we teach girls about other types of genre games, so if you're not familiar with First Person Shooter, we kind of talk about that. We also do kind of like 101 gaming for moms, so if you're a mom out there and your child is a son or a daughter who's really into games, we teach you about the ESRB rating. We teach you about what games are good for your child. We also talk about games you can play as a mom who's not very familiar with games as well. That sounds pretty cool. So how long have you been running this organization? Officially, it's been running since November 2011, but it's always been a dream and a passion ever since I can remember. So where do you see this site going? What's your vision for it? To be honest with anything, I don't have any expectations when it comes to this. It's kind of just like I want to do more. We definitely want to be able to just bring more women and more girls and more gamers into this community because we want to become a positive representation of the gaming community because in actuality, that's how the gaming community started. It started out with gamers very passionate about their hobbies and promoting it. Right now, I'm not going to say it's unbalanced, but I feel like there's not a lot of representations for females. There's not a lot of places that they can go to to either A. get the kind of news feeds they want or B. get the kind of information they need. We talk about video game fashion and we talk about this is actually a Legend of Zelda Fire from Ocarina of Time. It's a jewel, but it's been made out of a necklace. We showcase things like that because they're important. Particularly a girl, if she wanted to buy that, she could be able to find it on our website. That's pretty cool. I like that concept. I just like the idea of it and what you're working with and where it's going so far. Outside of this, what kind of games do you like to play? Right now, I'm playing Guild Wars 2 and I love Guild Wars 2 because I played Aeon and World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy and I played LOL. It's just I love, I don't like the I hit you, you hit me kind of gaming. I actually write for Game Tire and I wrote an article about the top 15 qualities for an MMORPG and Guild Wars 2 just seems to be nailing 85 to 90% of anything that I was asking for an MMORPG. Granted, it's not like WoW. WoW will always, I mean like the end game is just like the end game like Instance and Raids and World of Warcraft. You can't get that in Guild Wars 2 but Guild Wars 2 has just so much more opportunities for you to explore. You get points and you get rewarding experiences for helping out and I feel like Guild Wars 2 actually has this social aspect. I play mostly PS3 and PS2 and PS1 games, I ain't no Sony fan, but I'm completely a diehard Sega fan. I still have my Sega Dreamcast, I still have my Gensys. I didn't get a Saturn but I do have a Game Gear. But do you also have a Master System? I don't have a Master System. We might have to get her a Master System. I would love a Master System. I might know someone may have a spare but I'll have to double check with that. It's not that I didn't have it because I didn't want it. I didn't have it because of funs reasons. It's all good. Now, while running World of Warcraft have you ever reached any difficulties or any guys going what? You know to be honest yeah, but if I stopped when I came I wouldn't be where I am right now. You really need to understand that you will come across people that want you to fail but you got to understand that you're doing something that's you. You are a gamer. I'm a gamer. I know I'm a gamer and I know what I'm doing regardless of what anyone does makes me happy. Well there you go. I can't argue with that type of logic. So, when we get out of here, do you have any last words for any game girls out there who are like well, I don't know. You know to be honest, you can deny being a gamer all you want. But the moment you embrace it and be who you are even if you play Farmville even if you play a 3DS you know, it doesn't matter. If you're playing something that is immersed into a digital world you're playing a game and you shouldn't A. demote it as not being a gamer and B. you shouldn't diminish anybody else that's following that. The video game community is changing to include everything from science to medicine to psychology to even the industry booming in business. I mean, even fashion is becoming a big part of it and the moment that you discriminate and divide yourself, you're becoming a factor in the divide in the gaming industry that me and many other people are fighting against. Wow, those are some strong powerful words. Okay, so let me ask you girl gamer gamer girl doesn't really matter. It doesn't matter. What matters mostly is that if you say you're a girl gamer or a gamer girl and then you start posting photos with you with like controllers covering your boobs you're giving a terrible interpretation of what a girl gamer is. That is the line. If you are not a girl gamer and you're out there and you're promoting that you're a girl gamer and you're doing very sensual, provocative images and representation you are hindering what we're working for. I am fighting so hard and many other women are fighting so hard to give a positive representation of girl gamers. And if you're also directed to all you ladies that are out there that are doing this, stop. Because we're fighting through the right type of gamers and if you're hurting us you're an obstacle. And to be honest, we will try everything possible to overrun it. Because what you're doing is you're defeating us and you're contradicting what we're working so hard for. There are people that are spending time money and effort. There are women who are spending so much time, money and effort. And if you're out there, just please stop. If you want to be sensual if you want to be provocative, fine. Do it without a controller. Do it without saying that you're a girl gamer or a gamer girl. Because you're putting us in a bad light. And it's disrespectful it's hurtful and it's obnoxious. Wow, like I said, those are some really powerful words. So for everyone that's out there watching, listening, where can you find more information about Girl Gamer Vogue? Well, we're at GG Vogue, like GG's in Gorilla. GGVogue.com or Girl Gamer Vogue you can find us on Facebook, on Twitter, on Tumblr, on Instagram, on Flickr. I forget what other place we're associated with. But by all means, we need more girls who are just as passionate and prominent that are looking for a place to call home. Most of the people, if not all, probably like 99%, they are very comfortable people. You want to talk about games by all means. We're associated with a bunch of other communities as well. And if you want to play Call of Duty, Guild Wars, you know, whatever it is, we'll find you a place to find people, to find girls that you can be best friends with. And that's what we only want to be. We want to be good friends with you. Wow, that's pretty good. Well, Jen, thank you for your time. Thank you for having me. Thanks for coming. No problem. At least we can do. Whatever we can do for you, we're here for you. DJ Rama S, signing off. Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio. And thank you, DJ Rama S, for that interview. And especially Jen from Girl Gamer Vogue. I like her. She's really trying to do a good thing for the community. I like when she was talking about educating people about the ESRB system. And I really think and I hope everybody's listening to her when she talks about how, you know, our community is kind of growing and really embraced that, you know, you've got all these different types of casual gamers and gaming is something they do in all these different industries and so forth. So, yeah. Thanks to Rama for getting that interview for us. And thanks to Jen for being on the show, even though maybe she didn't know she was going to be on Orange Lounge Radio when she first did that interview. So, a big thank you all around. And I want to get our listeners thinking about this. Because I really liked what just happened there. I like that a listener kind of contributed that particular segment. And it gave us something to play on the show that we could actually put on the podcast that was interesting to listen to. And it was, you know, something a little different and the listener created. So, we want to try, come December or so forth, we would like to try opening up our breaks to listener created content. Now, that particular piece was a little bit long. But we're talking, think about something maybe a minute and a half to two minutes long. Maybe a news update on a particular game or series that you enjoy. Or, you know, maybe some community updates for a particular community that you're a fan of. Or something along those lines. We're not going to start playing those next week. But it's something we're looking at for December. Something where the users create content. Now, I do want to be clear on a few things. You won't be able to actually represent OLR and go get interviews and say, oh, my interview is going to be on OLR. No, no, that's for myself, Dark Soccer, and Loki to do. But, you know, talk to us if you have some ideas along those lines. We'll see what we can arrange. We just, you know, if you're going to represent OLR, we have to make sure that you're not going to do something that could anger a potential guest or what have you. So, just be thinking about that. We'll give you more details in the coming weeks. But that's something we're hoping to do on the show is institute user-created content in our breaks. So, awesome. And remember, I am Omega. Damn, apparently the live listeners lost the feed for a moment while I was making that pitch. But once again, we're looking at doing listener-created content during the breaks instead of music in little two-minute chunks or less for, you know, whatever community it is that you're passionate about. After all, it's the show where every gamer has a voice, and I think we've been neglecting one big way to get your voices on the show. Yeah, OLR reporters, OLR freelancers. I'm loving those terms in chat. Perfect. So, more information to come in the coming weeks. That's something we want to implement in January, or excuse me, December. Meanwhile, let's get back into some rapid-fire news. Loki, start us off. Alright. So, let's see. Let's talk a little bit about Black Ops 2 since that's going to be coming out this week. One of the things that they just recently announced before they had the whole streaming that you can do of your gameplay with the League play and stuff like that. Well, now it's been confirmed that that's going to be linked in with YouTube live streaming. So, you're going to build a live stream on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and on the PC version as well. No word on the Wii U yet because a lot of the integration that they have with Elite and stuff like that on the Wii U doesn't quite work. But, it's pretty cool. Also, I guess you're going to be able to see the player's gamer card of whoever you're streaming and some other additional information like class loadouts and stats and stuff like that. It's pretty cool. I actually did spot some of this stuff when I was doing the local play stuff. They had some options for that, but really neat that you'll be able to live stream games. I kind of wish they had that for Grand Theft Auto, but that's still a ways away. Neat. It's a neat idea. I know live streaming is pretty popular nowadays. I think that's a neat thing to build into the game, too. Yeah, I'm curious what this is going to bring. It's neat. Well, it's cool, too, because a lot of people don't have the hardware to kind of video capture everything that they're doing, so this is kind of built into the game, which I think is pretty cool. Well, it's fascinating how the industry is really embracing it, too. I would have assumed there was going to be resistance to it, especially, you know, we talked about the Microsoft policy and all that stuff some time ago, which is kind of this strange in the middle place, but it is very interesting how, you know, instead of the game companies going to try and shut down places like Twitch TV and the other streaming sites, they're really saying, alright, this is something people want to do. It's promotion for our game. Let's do it. Yeah. Now, here's a weird promotion. They're doing something with Halo 4 and their multiplayer, where they're actually allowing players to get Microsoft points for playing multiplayer, and here's how it works. Okay, so basically, if you get Halo 4 and you play 35 hours plus, and this is between launch until the end of this month, so November 30th is a cutoff for it, but if you play over 35 hours, you're going to get 100 Microsoft points. If you... Whoopee! I know. Whoopee shit. Ooh, a dollar and like 20 cents or something. Okay, so then if you play $1.25, that's what it was, 70 hours, guess what? You're going to double that. Or, I'm sorry, you're going to triple that. You're going to get 300 Microsoft points. Yay, a denomination that totally doesn't round out anything. So, you're going to have 300 Microsoft points possible there for you guys. Also, if you happen to play over 140 hours... Was this only online multiplayer? This is only online multiplayer. Halo 4 multiplayer... Matchmaking or customer, does it say? It's multiplayer over Xbox Live. So, I could make a custom match, set the timer to unlimited, have it run all day, have me and my friends set up a custom match have the timer run all day, and I could do that, right? If I wanted to be... I don't know if they'd let you do that. I mean, it would be a big waste of time, but I guess I suppose you could do that. Also, I guess they're also doing... It's going to be up to 800 Microsoft points. So, I'm kind of confused to where they're going to get this 800 Microsoft points, I guess. Oh, I'm sorry, the extra 200 is coming from spending at least 3,000 Microsoft points on the Halo Marketplace content. Woohoo, 200 points back after spending... So, it's like a dinky two-buck rebate. Yeah, 3,000 Microsoft points, which is the equivalent of almost... What is that? 40 bucks? Almost? I don't know. All the point values are just... It's annoying. So, yeah, there you have it. Some money back if you do that. Oh, and I guess also if you... If you spend, I guess, 1,500 Microsoft points, you get 100 Microsoft points back. Fantastic, I guess. But it is kind of neat, though, to see that you can earn some Microsoft points for playing a game for a long period of time. YYR says it's more like a thank you to the people who are going to do it anyway. I think it's just trying to get people to play a long time so that they can try to beat up Black Ops 2, which is probably going to dominate multiplayer, and they want to have it look nice when Halo 4 is at the top of the charts there, but it's going to be tough. And last but not least, there's been a lot of information regarding Grand Theft Auto 5 coming out. All of this coming from the brand new issue of Game Informer. And a lot of details regarding kind of the single player campaign, including, you know, first off, the game's map itself is going to be over... It's going to be bigger than Grand Theft Auto 4, San Andreas, and Red Dead Redemption combined. It's just the largest map in any of the games at all. So, that's fantastic. There's going to be three different people that you get to play as. Three different protagonists, including let's see here, I'm trying to remember the names of these guys. I don't remember. Well, anyways, that's not important. But three different people you get to play as. Also, they're going to have some different locations available in the game. Some of the stuff, obviously, you've seen in the trailers, including stuff based off of the vineyard areas. Obviously, Rockford Hills, which is like Beverly Hills. Blaine County, which is kind of like this desert. They say they have bikers and meth heads in there. Oh, goodie! Vespucci Beach, which is similar, I guess, to Venice Beach. Also, some beach fronts and stuff like that. They're saying also the game's going to have a Salton Sea region, a military base, suburban hills. There's a Mount Chiliad, I guess, which is a large wilderness area where you can explore all that. They're also going to have underwater areas that you can scuba dive in and stuff like that. They've got this brand new engine that has multi-mile draw distances in there. I guess also, you're going to be able to do all sorts of things from, they have a golf course that you can play a full round of golf in, if you really want to. Wow. All sorts of details. As long as I can beat people with my clubs. They have bowling, strip clubs, stand-up comedy acts, TV shows, internet cafes, kind of all similar to what they had before. You can also, I guess, go to the gym. You can attend a sermon. They've got yoga, triathlons that you can do, base jumping, tennis, jet skiing. Also, they're getting rid of the romance stuff in there because God was fucking annoying. One of the things I thought was really cool about it, though, is the three main characters, when you're switching between them, they go off on their own thing and do whatever. They'll go on their own business. It zooms out of the map like Google Earth, I guess, and then goes into these different characters. The three characters, Michael, who I guess is the guy who did the voiceover in the first trailer. He's a retired bank robber, and now he's kind of on the FIB, the FBI Witness Protection Program. He's hiding out. Also, there's a guy named Trevor, who is this crazy meth head, who is this crazy war veteran or whatever. Franklin, who is a repo man. It's kind of all them coming together to do these heists. But, lots of screenshots. Looks fantastic. New trailer is going to be coming out on the 14th this week. Very excited by that. This is definitely a game I'm highly, highly looking forward to. No fanboy involved. No, no, not at all. It's the biggest game next year. All right. Some rapid fire news for me. Gamefly's digital PC client is now out. It was in beta for a while, but it is now officially out. You can download this if you're anybody. You don't have to be a Gamefly subscriber to get it. Anybody can have it. Over 1,500 Windows and Mac titles. This is sounding a little bit like a commercial, but it's been around on the game blogs. If you are a member, you should be aware, because I know a lot of you guys are. You can do the whole unlimited PC play. It's pretty much GameTap. In a way. Except I don't think it's a lot of the classic games, but more kind of like the games that are, you know, they're not super old, but they're old enough to not really be selling anymore. Like, Saints Row 2 is unlimited PC play. Right? So, there you go. Oh, apparently, 2K games giving everybody who downloads the client a free copy of Bioshock. I don't know if that's still going, but it was going for a while. It probably only was on the launch day. It's probably done now. But still. I could just play that on PS3. That's true. Or, you know, a lot of folks bought the collection on Steam or what have you. Anyhow, Xbox 360 USB data storage. It was capped at 16 gigabytes. I don't know if you know that for the USB storage. They actually raised that. In this recent update that happened, it wasn't really out there, but it has been increased to 32 gigabytes. So, it has been confirmed with Microsoft that this was intentional. So, there you go. That's great news for those folks that need to make way for data to install their Halo 4 They should just not have a cap. Oh, I understand. I understand they want to sell their overly expensive hard drives for these systems, but it shouldn't have a cap. I mean, they're just selling these laptop SATA drives and charging a really huge premium on that stuff when I understand you can use external drives to supplement that, but only get 32 gigs of pop, whereas you can get 2 terabyte drive for half the price of like their 320 drive. So, why even bother? Well, in my last story here for rapid fire news, oh, you gotta love porno inspired by video games. Yes, Lollipop Chainsaw is inspiring a new porno in Japan called Tia's Geek Cosplay Fuck, and I love that fuck is all in capital letters with an exclamation point. And she dresses up as some of the various characters in Lollipop Chainsaw including a giant chainsaw and she cosplays and presumably fucks. Well, that is true. It's all the same character, it's just all of her alternate costumes from the game, so if I remember correctly, and judging by the back picture here, I don't think she dresses up like anybody else. It's hard to tell because the pictures are really small, but I do notice that it's definitely a lot of the alternate costumes. Although, that one might be, no, no, no, that's still... Who cares? Naked chick dressing up. Exactly. She's allowed to make some mistakes. And she has a giant really weird looking chainsaw. That has a heart at the end of it, but I guess that's from the game. So, there you go. That chainsaw just looks really weird. Cosplay Fuck! Dark Sakura. Try to follow that. Well, I did get Final Fuck 10 or X or whatever. Six mix. Mental note. Ask Eddie about Dance Dance Fuck next time he comes on the show. Well, a little girl named Maya gets to play Legend of Zelda The Wind Waker as a girl. Basically, her dad is developer Mike Hoy who basically hex-edited the game to replace all of the dialogue to be feminine in regards to Link's gender. So, instead of Swordman, it's Swordmane and Milady instead of My Lad and Master. And he's actually put the disc image up that you can play. And it's pretty neat. I think that's nice. So his daughter can have an adventure that feels more believable to a little girl. To be fair, he's not actually putting up the disc image because that would be piracy, but he's putting up the patch file that if you find the disc image with a certain MD5 hash, you can patch it. Lollipop Chainsaw stars a girl. Just saying. Yeah, and the game was also awful. That game is almost porn only as it is. It's pretty bad though, but it's just... Yeah. How old will Josh have to be before you let him play Lollipop Chainsaw? I won't let him play it because it's really terrible. I mean, it is a terrible game. He doesn't get to play bad games. Listen, if you're gonna waste your time on the game, just go on the internet and watch porn because seriously it's a better use of your time than playing this game. I mean, this game is just lame. Next story. Yes. The Angry Video Game Nerd. Now for anyone who's kept up with that Kickstarter, you know, there was a Kickstarter to do a movie, and there's a trailer up. I watched it yesterday. And I was like, really? Ugh. It looks like a bad 90s comedy. I know, I'm gonna watch it just for that. But, I don't know, there were some parts that made me laugh, like the guy going, Where the fuck is my arm? Isn't that guy from something because he looks like, he looks like, was it the, um, the boss that they had in one of the Mega Man games where he had like the, you know, the tank body type thing? I, maybe, I don't know. Maybe he's supposed to be a really screwed up American Dr. Wily. It looks cheesy like that Gamers movie. Remember there's a lot of people that thought that Gamers movie was so awesome and then they made a sequel to it for God knows what reason. It's probably because they made a lot of money off of it. But, yeah, it's, whatever. It's supposed to be cheesy. People buy it if, you know, or if it's a Kickstarter, he's gonna make money from it. Well, um, you know how before we talked about Minecraft being used in schools? Well, another game is being used in schools, and that's Happy Action Theater. The big, uh, double fine green screen game, um, they're using it in schools now to help kids with autism since verbal language is difficult for autistic kids, then, um, they use it for different types of communication and it's actually, they're getting some, uh, significant results with it. I think that's really cool. And I'm dead. Alright, let's get to the FUGL Question of the Week. It's right here. Every week, we ask a question on our fan communities on Facebook and Google Plus. Smoosh them together, you get FUGL. So, uh, here it is. Uh, in honor of the fact that we talked a lot about music games tonight. Our show was born of the music gaming community, but we know we've picked up a variety of listeners since our debut over ten years ago and our shift to a general gaming show several years ago. So what is your current thoughts on music gaming? Is that a genre of game you are into? Do you think it was a fad that has faded with the rise and fall of Guitar Hero in the States? Or is the best yet to come? Now, because our show is running a little long tonight, I'm gonna keep this really short. I'm only gonna read a few of these answers, but I really encourage you guys to read the full responses on our Google Plus community, Orange Lounge Radio, and Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio. Uh, going to Google Plus, I'm gonna read this one from Redertainment. Like fashion music and my exercise group, things run in cycles. Music gaming will have its comeback, then fizzle out, then comeback, then fizzle out again. However, ABBA is forever. Preach. Of course you like that one. Preach. Of course I read that one. How to get Rob to read your comment. Uh, Nick M. replies and said, Music is a way for us to all express ourselves and tap into those feel-good emotions. So it really meshes with about any form of entertainment. For this reason, I believe the music genre will continue to grow with gaming. It will never die. Technology innovations and creativity will allow music-driven games to make a huge revival leaving the best to come. Those are some answers from our Google Plus community. Let's do a couple from Facebook over at Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio. Uh, Matt J. replied and said, I love music gaming still. My rock band library has grown to over 1700 songs and I'm playing almost every day that I can with a close group of friends. It's been sad to see people leave the community, but I'm still able to find new people I haven't played with. While my enthusiasm has died down significantly over the years, I'm still very much involved because of the social aspect, even online. There's such a wonderful, but small, group of people playing and it's such an enjoyable experience to play along to old-time favorites with friends or even to discover new music. Um, going on to some more answers here. Oh, I want to hear from this guy here, DJ Melvis. Yay! The popularity of music gaming now compared to 10 years ago is really night and day, or is nearly night and day. What propelled the music gaming crowd then was the gamer community, who propelled it from a cult following to something mainstream. Competitive tournaments, video footage of said tourneys, it was something people looked forward to and buzzed about. Konami, in America, failed to capitalize on that momentum and assumed the fans would eat up anything they put out. Instead of working with and cultivating their fanbase, they turned a blind eye to them. That ultimately killed a majority of their following. Combine that with the demise of arcade gaming in America, the tournament scene died and the community grew further apart. Rockband is pretty much music gaming's last stand. At least they nailed the whole microtransaction process with DLC, and events like UmLoud validate its popularity. Go harmonics! Good plug for UmLoud, by the way, which is coming up real soon. Tell me about it. Um, let's see, I'll do one more here from Facebook. Again, I'm really sorry I'm limiting this tonight, but we're just running long night. Chiggers replies and says, I've been saying the same thing. I wonder, too, if they could do something like trumpet smith or sitar smith. I do think they need to somehow incorporate music theory into some of the games, though, too. Sure, it's fun to play some of your favorite songs by memory, but you can't pick up the guitar and read music and play something that's not on the game. For the record, there has been Sitar Hero. That was a joke, though, right? That was on the Austin Powers 3 website as a Flash game. But it did exist. Very interesting. Alright, so. Was it Austin Powers 3 or was it the, uh, the Love Guru? It was the Love Guru, that was right, yeah. Everybody forgot about that game. Everybody should forget about that movie. So, there you go. Quickly, I'll go around the room. What's your current thoughts on music gaming? I think it'll always have a niche. We have to remember it didn't really start with DDR or Beatmania. It was dance aerobics. But, you know, I think games, especially in America, games like Parappa the Rappa, and I know I loved Bust a Move or Bust a Groove or whatever they called it over here. We need to totally break that out. What? Oh, I know, but it was a great game. So, I mean, I kind of feel like there were games before, and there will still be games in the future. I think it, kind of like that originally, that first comment I read where, like, it comes, it goes, it comes, it goes. I think, um, that's kind of how I feel. Loki, Dark Saga? Now the Facts of Life theme is stuck in my head. You take the good, you take the bad. No. Um, I love music games, so I don't really, I think it's gonna just kind of, right now, coast along with a lot of the dancing franchises with Just Dance and Dance Central and that kind of stuff. Um, maybe with the new systems they'll find new ways to kind of incorporate whatever type of peripherals that they have into it, like, you know, with the Wii U tablet or something like that. Um, I just, you know, I hope it doesn't, I assume it's just gonna keep, you know, staying around for a while, because you still have, you know, a niche audience that's really into it, and sometimes that's all it takes is just a niche audience, because, I mean, look at a lot of the Atlas products and stuff like that that don't sell millions of copies, and you have dozens and dozens of sequels. Alright, let's move on with some more news, and then we'll get to the mailbag and some quick calls tonight. So, uh, Loki. Alright. So, let's talk a little bit about some really weird patents, and Microsoft has one now that, it's basically this kind of DRM system that's gonna use a Kinect-like camera to basically monitor the number of users that are watching a display of a certain performance or content or whatever, and, um, basically, you know, tracking the faces of those viewers to see if they have appropriately licensed it. So, for example, I mean, it sounds kind of stupid, but, like, let's say I rented a movie or something like that, and then I have to go to the bathroom and I leave, that the movie would stop or something because I'm no longer in the room, and it's like, oh, shit, the person that, you know, registered this content is no longer in the room. I mean, that sounds a little ridiculous, but, I mean, I don't know if this is necessarily gonna be something that they do. Um, you know, mentions, I guess, gaming and gaming media, also mobile devices. Maybe my thought is that it's like, you know, your computer will lock, I mean, they have it right now already with, like, some of those biometric sensors and stuff, but maybe it's something where your computer will lock down if, like, you know, it doesn't recognize you. Although that's gonna suck if you get in a car accident and your face gets defigured, but, you know, I don't know. Or, you know, um, I know a lot of the live listeners are complaining that the OLR feed is going up, what did they say? Uh, Raginator said, OLR is going down faster and more frequently than White House interns when Clinton was in office. Well, you know, I like to, uh, grow and shave a beard pretty frequently as well. I like having a beard, but then I'll shave it when I have to do Rocky or something, an onstage part that requires me to shave it. So, you know, how's that gonna pick that up? I'm gonna put it this way. It's not that sophisticated. It's basically looking at facial geometry, like, you know, the proportions between, you know, space between your eyes. So the, you know, bone structure and that kind of stuff. It's like, okay, your face is this wide, your eyes are this far apart. Yeah, but that technology's not gonna work. That's the problem. The, you know, the Kinect was supposed to do all this stuff and it doesn't really work in the real world. And who really likes signing into Xbox Live by staring at the Kinect for like 30 seconds? Or hitting A and signing in, like, you know, right away? I really hope this technology is only being patented to harness it so that nobody can ever use it. That is my real true hope. But I'm not gonna hold my breath. We'll see. We had news earlier in the year that Nintendo Power was gonna be having its last issue ever. And, uh, guess what? PlayStation, the official magazine, following right behind. The holiday 2012 issue will be the last issue of the official, or, excuse me, PlayStation, the official magazine. That is not long after Future US, who also published Nintendo Power, announced that shutdown. So, uh, bye-bye. Magazine's going bye-bye. There's two. Out the door. It's unfortunate we don't have, like, an iPad version of it or something that lives on. I don't know. Maybe. It makes me very depressed because print is beautiful. And ink smells good. I know, but, well, what do you think can be done to save this dying industry? We still have Play, don't we? I think so. I love that magazine. Play better not go anywhere. But, uh, what would, I mean, do you think this is something that could make a renaissance someday, where we get, or is this done because of technology? Well, we got EGM again, right? Is this just done because of tablets? I know you don't like to think about it, but... It's a shift. Somebody's gotta design the tablet document if we go there. It really is. The nature of media is really turning digital, which is good and bad. I mean, I can produce digital content. The method's the same way. I'm more worried about how stuff like that is going to affect printers and the print shops that rely on having a steady client, a big client, especially one like Sony, or not Sony, but, you know, the magazine, you know, it's just gonna put a couple more, you know, little nails in while they're building that coffin. What do you think about this comment from Dan Shadow in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com? No one reads, and the internet is full of pictures. Speak for yourself. Well, here's something like, you know, the whole shift from digital, or from print to digital. Game Informer has a digital version. How did they get me to switch over to the digital version from print? The Grand Theft Auto information came out this week on the digital version, and two weeks later on print. So I want the digital version. And so that's what it is. It doesn't matter anyways. I thumbed through it once, and then I put it aside, and then I throw them away months later. Loki brings up a good point. Is it that need-to-know- right-now mentality, especially in the gaming culture, that might be hurting magazines a little bit? Well, yeah. Here's the thing, too. It probably doesn't help. All that Grand Theft Auto information, immediately as soon as it hit the digital version, it hit the NeoGAF forums, and then it hit all the blogs, and it hit all the websites. So even if you didn't subscribe to that magazine, unless you wanted to read the article by yourself, you got all the information that was right there. To wait for it to be in print is just ridiculous. Why would you do that? I mean, other than appreciating the art of printing and all that stuff. And pretty pictures to look at. But now that you have digital versions, there's really nothing that's exclusive anymore to them, momentarily at least. Hell, let's be honest. It took them a day or two to get my digital version converted over. I looked at screen caps, because you can do screen caps on your iPod or iPhone or on your iPad, and I looked at screen caps of the whole articles. I didn't even need the digital version to read that stuff. So, yeah, it's like, it's kind of, you know, unless you have these exclusive articles that are in your magazine, and you're not sharing this stuff, you know, online, and even then, when the print article comes out, people are just going to post it on a forum, which is going to get posted everywhere else. It just, it moves too fast for print. Alright, let's move on to Well, this is, as soon as it works, this is, um, an old format that had a game released in 2010. Um, have you ever heard of Pier Solar? It was released in 2010 for the Sega Mega Drive, or, as we know it, the Genesis, and it's, uh, like, a 64 megabyte cartridge. It was huge. And it was very well received. Now, the group Watermelon, the developer, has a Kickstarter to release an HD version to come out for Xbox 360, PC, Mac, Linux, and Dreamcast. Um, the game already has, uh, over 50 hours of gameplay, 300 locations, and 800 NPCs. I actually watched the, um, the little, uh, interview on here, and it looks pretty neat. There, um, if you pledge $15, you'll receive a copy of, uh, the game when it's released for whatever platform you wish, and $45 get a limited edition 4 CD copy of the soundtrack or a digital bundle consisting of the game on Xbox 360, PC, Mac, Linux, one of the three, as well as a digital copy of the soundtrack. There's also a limited edition for $125. There's a hard copy of the game for either Dreamcast or PC, Mac, Linux, and, um, the Pierce Solar guidebook, signed, uh, lithograph, and three figurines. There's only going to be 250 of them, uh, produced, and as of, uh, when I was reading this, there were, uh, just under a hundred pre-ordered. This actually might be the first one I put money into. The game looks awesome. Um, and, uh, there were, uh, the, uh, $999 Kickstarter exclusive Dreamcast ones, um, have already been ordered, so, they are currently at $76,468 out of their $139,000 goal. And they have 26 days to go, so I want this, and I think everyone should check it out. Bye. Alright, just a few more stories, then we'll get to the mailbag and the FUs of the week. Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com Alright, so, um, I think we talked about this before, but there was some whole controversy about the Navy SEALs actually helping the developers of Medal of Honor Warfighter with some of the details of the game and stuff like that, and it probably doesn't help that they have the whole DLC tying in with that movie Zero Dark Thirty, which is about the whole, you know, SEAL Team 6 infiltrating Osama Bin Laden's camp and stuff like that. So anyways, apparently, um, seven SEALs so far have received letters of reprimand, effectively denying them of promotion and also knocking off half their salaries for, or docking them half their salaries for two months. Which, you know, obviously they're probably getting paid by EA anyways, but, um, but yeah, so, that's I don't know, I guess four of the seven affected are still engaging in, um, active duty and are still under investigation. But, um, that kind of sucks. But then again, if you're in the military and you're revealing military secrets to a game company, it's kind of a problem. This is having some huge ramifications, too. This is the type of thing I'm hearing reported on CNN. Yeah. You know? So. Well, I mean, that's kind of like even a breach of security as far as national security. You know, if you're talking like tactics and stuff like that, that your SEAL team deployed to infiltrate, you know, this compound and stuff, that's just you're not supposed to be sharing that stuff. Right. Right. How historically accurate is too historically accurate? Especially when it's so recent, you know? Yeah. Well, moving on to something completely different. Capcom is apparently going to be hiring 1000 people. That's pretty cool. 1000 people over the course of 10 years. But that would be adding to the 1500 game developers that are on staff currently. This is a Capcom representative saying, quote, we want to further improve the quality of our games by maintaining an internal game development team. The purpose of increasing our game developer team is to create a larger percentage of our games internally. Therefore, we believe that there will be no significant change in total development expenditures, mainly because we will be shifting outsourced operations to our own workforce. That's pretty neat because, you know, there's a lot of that outsourcing that goes on in the gaming industry as well. And, you know, for all the Capcom is evil chats that go on and, you know, certainly they've made some pretty shitty decisions over the past couple of years. Let's be real. This is pretty cool that they are going to be bringing a lot of jobs back. Do notice, though, that that doesn't necessarily mean it's a thousand jobs here. It's probably a thousand jobs in Japan. But, you know, still, more internally developed games, I think, means they can kind of keep a closer eye on things and hopefully get some better products. We'll see. Interesting. So, Capcom. Sounds like they're almost it's almost double, but not quite. So. All right. Well, let's get to our mailbag segment. Every week you guys send us emails mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com and we read some of our favorites here on the air. Dark Soccer, why don't you dive into the mailbag head first and read some emails for us. Just three. Just three? First of all, this one's a little long, but I'll try to get through it quickly. Hey, OLR, AZHP here. I heard you guys talk about Rhode Island suing 38 Studios for $75 million, basically assuming that Rhode Island was in the right for lawsuit. It seemed like there were some assumptions being made, so I wanted to clear up some misconceptions. The lawsuit is not as straightforward as 38 Studios didn't put out a game and we want our money. 38 Studios declared bankruptcy, which typically prevents a company from being pursued by creditors, in this case the state of Rhode Island. However, Rhode Island suit claims that 38 Studios and Kurt Schilling misled Rhode Island as to the difficulties involved with putting out an MMO, and because Rhode Island was misled that $75 million was loaned in poor trust and should be repaid. There's another misconception I wanted to clear up. Rhode Island approached 38 Studios promising the $75 million loan and tax breaks if 38 Studios would move their operation to Rhode Island in the first place. Basically, they wanted 38 Studios to come to Rhode Island. This is basically like a bank saying, hey, we'll give you a good deal on a loan to buy a house, lending you the money, you losing your job, going bankrupt and foreclosing due to unforeseen circumstances, and the bank saying whoa, whoa, whoa, you didn't tell me there was a possibility you would lose your job. We want our money back. We're going to take your house. So as you guys can see, it's not as clear cut that Rhode Island deserves any money at all. If you make an investment and it doesn't pay off, in my opinion, you should go suck it up and take your lumps. But try telling that to the governor of Rhode Island. Just my two cents on the matter is HP OLR's premier gold star recipient. You know, I think that's a good point that he brings up, is that, you know, Rhode Island did, and I thought we kind of touched on this a little bit last week because, and I'm going to say it again now, why was it so goddamn important that they get this guy in the first place? You know, and I remember I mentioned last week, were we blinded by our sports culture? Where we hold these sportsmen that do so well in such high regard. You know, was that really Rhode Island's mistake possibly? And yeah, if that was their mistake, then they in turn need to pay for that. You know, I don't know. But like some of our chatters were saying last week, you know, I say all this, you know, and I know it sounds really cold and really mean, and then I'm like anti- sport. I'm not. I'm not any of those things. I am. I'm kidding. And I think Curt Schilling and all them meant well, but you know, I would like to do a lot of things. Are you going to give me 75 million dollars because I mean well and I have good intentions and some real good ideas? Probably not. You're going to expect to see some things. You know, I just, I I just think the celebrity of it all is what's really to blame at the end of the day. But, anyhow. Next one is and I'm going to save the biggest for last, so. Next one is just a quick update on a game I talked about last time I emailed. And this comes from Catastrophic Moggy, by the way. It's Persona 4 Arena will not make it to Europe this year. I heard about that. You guys got screwed because that's the region locked one, huh? That is so messed up. And people wondered why we bitched about it being region locked. I was a pretty big Shin Megami Tensei fan. I was really looking forward to this game and we still have no idea when it will be released. Only that it won't be this year. Sigh. Excuse me. You guys got hosed. That's really unfortunate. I really don't know what else to say except that, you know, I wouldn't fault you for pirating it at that point. I'm not supposed to encourage that. You can't really if it's region locked. Are you suggesting that people can't work around that? Well, you can, but you need a J-Tech system on Xbox 360 or a recent glitch hack system. That's what I thought. And the last email comes from your boyfriend. Loki's boyfriend? No. Yes, Loki's boyfriend. That was too easy. Hi, Alan. I know you don't. Hi, Alan. This question is for Dr. Sakurai and it's related to Mass Effect. So the upcoming Omega DLC looks pretty rad, but starting with ME3 proper, Bioware made some really glaring weird sexist mistakes both in Fem Shep's handling as well as her relationship soiling Kayden for a lot of shippers who don't give a fuck about Dude Shep. Me included. Thanks to this, many in the fandom have joked that the female versions of Mass Effect aliens will end up being male face plus bad perm plus stock tits armor. My question is, how do you feel about Nereen having proper separated breasts in screenshots instead of just a larger breastplate region in her robe, considering that Turians are clearly supposed to be avian, reptilian, or both? I'm not asking if you're offended personally, though if you are, let it out, but from a design perspective, since they otherwise did a good job on her face and had detailing. And that's from Alan. First of all, I actually didn't notice she had boobs. I thought she just had plating. Or maybe like a kind of segmented chest plate type of thing. Because, and I didn't even really look, think to look because of cut dialogue in Mass Effect 2. And that's what I linked to you earlier. That I wanted to play. Oh, yeah, sure. You're like looking at me like what? Yes, yes, keep talking. Alright, hold on, what am I playing here? It's the groundskeeper on the Citadel in Mass Effect 2. Good evening human. It is evening isn't it? Without day and night I lose track. I shipped in from Pallavin last month. I'm still getting my bearings. You'd be surprised how much a trained horticulturalist can earn here. The nicest thing about being on the Citadel has to be the drinks. You might not believe it, but my species hasn't invented many intoxicants. I'm constantly amazed by human creativity when it comes to brewing and distilling. Ever had aquarian thruster fuel? Must be 99% alcohol. I think they distill it from raw antimatter. Antimatter alcohol. Excuse me for asking, but you're a female, right? You got those funny bumps. Like an asari. Every time I come in here some asari asks me to dance. First of all, turians don't dance. Second of all, asari have those funny bumps that get in the way. That's what I was trying to get to. That was cut dialogue. Basically, you know where you go talk to him after the croak and ask if there's fish in the reservoir? That was cut dialogue for him. You got some funny bumps, Dark Sakura. Shut up. Those are some big bumps. Shut up. You know, I actually did have a kitten stand on my boobs yesterday. Did you? My friend drove me to PetSmart and I was close to throwing down 60 bucks for this kitten because it reminds me of Shermy, but that wouldn't be fair to Shermy's memory. But yeah, the kitten passed the standing on boobs test. Just stood there and then curled up and purred. Like, okay. I'll have to hold you. But yeah, back to Mass Effect. So I actually didn't even look, and I have some of the comics. I didn't read some of the I looked at pictures of what the female turians looked like in some of those comics and I had the Yeah, oh my god. I'm sorry for She doesn't look like super endowed. Yeah, it's not like overly sexualized. I think is important to keep in mind. It's not like she's got some tig old biddies. You know, it's just like, okay, she's got some funny bumps. That's it. It looks like it I mean, they kind of look flattish. Like, more like an extended ribcage. Yeah. Like a, well I mean in general, I think turian ribcage is supposed to be really high if you ever looked at the naked model. It's a fucking alien race. Why are we so, like in a fake video game, it's a fake alien race. Like, why are we so like, oh, but it's not lizard accurate. Well, it's not a fucking lizard. Those are the worst press I've seen on lizard yet. Well, I mean, my point was it's not something I noticed because first of all, I didn't really see evidence of it in the comics. And there was that cut dialogue. I didn't think to look for boobs. You know, I was like, okay, turian chicks don't have boobs. Good for them. They probably regurgitate to feed their young. If they're based off of birds or lizards, then that's kind of gross, but Alan is in our chat room right now and says, it's more of an issue that they are hard and rough and scaly, but suddenly soft jubilees. How do you know those aren't some rough, scaly boobs? How do you know they're not all like, how do you know those aren't the slimiest tits you'll ever see? Remember Morden and his chafing? We'll prescribe analgesics. May cause chafing. But, um, but, um, I think that it's not so much of a big deal. I think I may feel differently when I actually play it and see them in action, see if they bounce. But it didn't look like boob boobs, you know? It just looked like a hint of boob. Alan in chat is apologizing. Sorry I asked. I thought it was interesting. No, it is I'm yelling at the internet. I'm not yelling at you. I would never yell at you. I cannot wait, by the way, to play through Omega with FemShep. With Team Badass Bitch. Cause Aria and Nereen. Yeah, Omega has one rule. Don't fuck with Aria. That's my rule too. Don't fuck with me. Good times. Yeah, and Tigerclaw is right. Javok did call Solarian's lizard people and also said that raw Solarian liver is a delicacy. And that they used to eat flies. Alright, let's get, is that it for emails? Yes, it is. Let's get to the FUs of the week. Every week we rant on this show because we can. This is bad. Here is justice. Here is punishment. Don't care. This is fucked up. I have a huge FU that goes to a condition called angular calitis. Which some people can use for cold source or canker source. What they are is when you get a lesion in the corner of your mouth that forms kind of a pussy scab. And it happens to lots of people. But the thing that I hate about it you know, yeah this happened. It happens from a vitamin deficiency and basically a lot of stress. But what I hate is waking up in the morning and having to yawn and forgetting all about it and then just it hurt really badly. And also drivers in the parking lot and Whole Foods you know, screw all you entitled rich people. Loki. Fuck you to Ford in my car. He's breaking. Like, I had the last last time I took it in to get repaired which you know was about $1200 for the repairs I think. You know, he took a bunch of stuff and then broke down a month later. The guy there who had this really weird growth on his face said, oh yeah I've seen those cars last for 300,000 miles. Yeah, after you replace every goddamn part in the car four times it's probably lasted that long. But then again, it's not the original car anymore now is it? That's it. If you want to know my FU of the week, refer to the top of the show. It was kind of a shitty weekend. I don't want to go back to work tomorrow. Wham. But I guess we have to be funny. Alright, a couple more news stories for you guys and then we'll open up the Skype line quickly at 1877 Game OLR. I emphasize quickly, we might only do one or two calls tonight depending on who all tries to get in. And of course Twitter topics, we'll get through as many of those as we can. Twitter.com slash OLR. Loki. So, Silicon Knights, you remember they were suing Epic Games over the whole, you know, oh Unreal 3 is so hard to use. And they made our game shit. Not because we suck or anything. But they lost. Boop. So on top of that, not only did they lose but the new ruling I guess doubled the damages from 4.5 million to 9 million. And on top of that they also have to destroy any games that they have, any unsold games that they have using the Unreal 3 engine. So, I don't know. So I guess that means two human X-Men, Destiny, Siren in Maelstorm, The Sandman, and The Box slash Ritualus. All these games I was a really big fan of. So if they're destroying all these games would that mean that they have to con- They're going in a landfill. By destroying, does that mean that they just get to work on them a little bit longer? Yeah. That's what you get when you place the blame on somebody else. When, you know, really it was just your inability to program these games. Alright, well one more story for you guys. Then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. This is a story about Charles Hwang. If you don't know that name you probably know something he co-created. It's Guitar Hero. Well what's he doing now? Is he doing another music game or doing something else with gaming? Not exactly. It's called Green Throttle Games is the company he's working on. It's a mobile to TV app and controller. What it's trying to do is turning smartphone games into a big screen experience by connecting a mobile device directly to an HDTV. This would be playable on wireless, Bluetooth controllers via what's called the Green Throttle Arena app. In other words, you know, I think it's a great idea but Apple could knock this out of business in a heartbeat. It's a dangerous territory I think. There's a lot of people have been saying Apple TV is only moments away from doing something like this. I don't know. That's all fan wank and Apple hasn't done it. My only issue with this and great for him to do something like this but you can do this with any Bluetooth controller. Seriously, you take a Bluetooth controller, you pair it with your phone or device, you get the TV out cable hook it up to your TV via HDMI. Boom. You have exactly what he's selling. Except, you know, now they're going to have all these apps that are within this other app that are basically going to all support this device. But you can do that right now with any controller. In fact, you can not only do it with any controller, you can do it with a controller you already have. Like a DualShock 3 controller or a Wii U or a Wii Remote with the Classic Controller Pro or something like that tied in with it. They have a lot of games that do support these things and with a TV out cable you can do this already. But they're wrapping in a nice package I guess so that, you know, it's easy for consumers to find all the games that support this controller. And it's important to note they are also developing their own games in house. So, you know, even if Apple were to push a button and really fuck this idea over, they'd still have, hopefully, some solid games to fall back on. I'm surprised they haven't done anything like that. And, to be fair, I want to throw this out here to give this whole thing a break because I don't want to sound like I'm poo-pooing the idea because I'm not. I would love to be able to play smartphone games on the TV. There's a lot I would like to be able to do that with. Um, but, um, oh, that's my train of thought. Where was I going with this? The, um, Radio Guy's Worst Enemy Derailed Train I think a lot of the games, also, it seems like a lot of them are touch-based. Well, not necessarily the games that they're pitching, but like, um, you know, like Angry Birds or something like that. I don't know what I was going to say. Open Faint is like an Apple, or is an iOS thing that a lot of gaming, you know, companies use to plug into their games to do online leaderboards and so forth. Game Center hasn't put that out of business because Open Faint, I guess, offers either it's easier to implement or it's a richer package. Multi-platform. Multi-platform as well and so forth. So, you know, who knows? Green Throttle could go multi-platform too, I would think. Hypothetically, you know, with Android tablets or whatever. I don't think even if they did something like that where, you know, Apple TV or whatever had some sort of Bluetooth support, which I, honestly, I'm surprised that that device doesn't have Bluetooth support, you know, the whole Apple TV. You know, what they could do, which would be interesting, is have if you have an Apple TV, because doesn't the Apple TV support like streaming, like you can content stream stuff from your iPod or iPad to the TV. Maybe say you content stream something to the TV and then you use a Bluetooth controller with that and then you can basically use the iPad or iPod or iPhone device as like a tether, almost like, you know, using the Wii Classic Controller, Classic Controller Pro with the Wii. You have to use the Wii Remote as kind of like the Bluetooth tether to that. Alright, well, we're going to move on to the Skype line. 1877 Game OLR or our username on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. It is open for business now. In the meantime, we'll get some last minute stories and I want to do some Twitter topics as well. Things that were sent into twitter.com slash OLR. I want to do this one first. This is from dammit, come on, load. Here we go. This one's from actdeft. Give a listen to the Wii U menu music. It's really good and entrancing. I did not know that this was out, but apparently here it is. Here's the thing though. I want to go into skeptic mode here because I noticed that the YouTube here has a link to a website where it says full album available and then it says check out more Wii U music and news at such and such website and it's not an official Nintendo site either. Now I'm not saying maybe these guys didn't get a Wii U but I'm always kind of curious when it's this much blatant like go here, go to this site. I don't know. I'm just saying. I'm just saying. Could be legit. What do you think? Is this it? Is this the real deal? It sounds pretty Nintendo-y. It does sound a little pretty Nintendo-y. I believe it. Yeah, I'm not sure. We'll know within days because those things are going to be out very, very, very soon. Uh, let's go to phones. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this? Hey, so we're Nate. How's it going? Hey, good. How are you, Nate? Going good. Listen to all y'all talks about vaporware and green throttle and Wii U music. Yeah. I just wanted to ask you all who do you think is going to win the upcoming console war? Who's going to win the upcoming console war? And to answer your question whether that was legit or not, yes, it is. We actually have more menu music. Because Kotaku, they were reviewing they have their own Wii U thing and they wouldn't post a story like that if it was completely wrong, you know, because they have a Wii U to compare that to. Ah, I see. Okay, thank you for that clarification. I'm always a little skeptical when it's the internet. Alright, so Nate's loaded question. No, I'm kidding. It's not a loaded question. It's a tough question. Who's going to win the upcoming console war? Nate, I think it's too damn early to tell. And I think you only have one console. Well, here's the thing because we don't know what PlayStation 4 and what the new Xbox have under their belt. We're not really going to know that until E3. Right now we have to also evaluate, you know, how is the Wii U going to do? We're hearing about sellouts and pre-order stuff and that they're hard to get but how much of that is legitimately everybody wants them in demand and how much of that is Nintendo is slowly like a faucet drip letting these consoles out to create that artificial demand. Well, I'm going to tell you right now who's going to win the whole console wars here and it's going to come out of left field here. It's the GE Micro Box microwave slash console. Because we're talking about the future and no one knows what the future is, that's what's going to win. Microwave console. Okay, another question. Alright. Okay, so I'll hear you all talking about Green Throttle. If you have to pick between Green Throttle and Ouya, who would you vote for? Oh, damn. That's a pretty good question because I don't really know enough about Green Throttle yet. Based on presentation and power and fame, glory, money. I'm going to have to go Ouya. Only reason because it's an actual console versus basically Green Throttle is just, okay, we have a controller that's paired with some games that we're making. But it doesn't have any hardware platform that it's meant for. They don't have like their own Android device or something. So you're going to get varied performance depending on what kind of Android device that you have. So that's the only problem there is it's not a standardized platform. Whereas the Ouya is actually going to be a device that they make games for that they know will run well on that platform. I'm going to say the Ouya as well because again, I'm a little concerned about Apple could really knock this Green Throttle thing down a few pegs by doing their own thing. Whereas the Ouya is going to be a little tougher. I think the Ouya is kind of trying to beat Apple at it's own game in a way. I think it's a little different. So I'm going to go Ouya as well. Okay, last question. What game are you giving the best game to come out between now and summer? Now and summer. So of all these games that got pushed back to 2013 that make up the first and second quarter releases, what's going to be the best game to come out? I'm going to say Mass Effect Trilogy on PS3. No, no, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I am really looking forward to the Tomb Raider reboot. That's not coming out before summer. Oh, get out. I thought it was pushed back to like March. Yeah, yeah, go look that up in your Funkin' Wagonals. I'm looking forward to Omega. Omega DLC, Mass Effect. Are there any games? Come on. Oh! Omega. I don't know if it'll make summer, Nate, but the Final Fantasy XIV Realm Reborn. No, that's fall next year. I'm damn curious about that. Okay, awesome. Okay, I'll get off your Skype line. I think other people might want to call in. That's alright, buddy. Clearly the correct answer is Grand Theft Auto V. I was going to say, I'm not even going to ask Loki because I know the answer is Grand Theft Auto V. So there you go, a wide variety of answers. With a close second being Bioshock Infinite. Oh, yeah, that's going to be a win, too. Well, Nate, I'm going to turn the tables on you. I got a question for you. Um, I don't, I don't give questions. But, yes. Ask away. Alright, you've asked us about console wars and what we're looking forward to and all this stuff. What do you want to see happen in gaming in 2013? Okay, so, um, I'm just going to be a little vague because there's other things I could talk about but I want to talk about now. Um, I would like to see, um, the rise of indie gaming and also, um, like, far less social games and all these, like, small, like, touchscreen games. I would like to see less of in 2013. Alright, so you want to see indie games come up, but you want to see social games go away. I got to tell you, though, buddy, that's where a lot of indies get their start right now is on iPhone and all that stuff. Are you okay with the mobile games? Um, I don't have a smartphone, so that's, that's like a no. So, so screw everybody else. Um, I'm a consoleer, PCer, um, I try to play Angry Birds, but that's PC. That's, you know what, there's indie, of course, has a huge life on PC and lots of great indie stuff gets their start on PC, so, and I'm with you. I'd like to see some more indie games make it big. You know, uh, the best games to come, we probably don't even know about yet. Think about that. Alright, Nate, thank you for the questions. We appreciate it. Have a good one, buddy, okay? Alright, talk to you later. Alright, you too. Bye. See, I like that. I like the whole you're gonna ask me questions? Oh, yeah, buddy, I got a question for you. Our job sucks, huh? No, I'm kidding. No, I loved it. I love getting questions. 1877 Game OLR, or our username on Skype. Orange Lounge Radio! Let's go to the phones. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this? Legend Zaku here. Zaku, you must have loved that interview tonight. Huh? Did you, did you hear our interview with Eddie tonight? Um, yeah, yeah, definitely. I, I just caught, like, the, I guess, the tail end of it. Oh. After, like, watching Walking Dead. For, oh, oh, oh, we got, we got shafted for walking. I, I, I hear it through the show. I'm sorry, but that's kind of, like, religion here. We don't, we don't have blood and guts and zombies yet. I had a stein full of, like, beer ready to go and my snacks. But, yeah, um, I guess this is probably gonna be out of the ordinary, but I've had this, uh, this thing that, had, like, my Steam collection that I've been wanting to, like, wrangle down because I've, like, gotten so many games that I have a backlog. It's created, created such a backlog that I'm not sure how to actually systematically approach having to tackle all these games that I have. I'm gonna post it right now in the chat room. And I'm just, like, like, I have some of them already. I'm putting time on them, but there's still, there's still plenty, like, that I just bought because they were cheap at that point and I just got them for the sake of getting them. But now it's, like, I don't know, like, I'm, like, preventing myself from getting games because of, because it's gonna add, it's gonna add more fuel to the fire. Well, you're doing the right thing by investing 99 hours in Skyrim. 52 hours Team 76, Battlefield Bad Company. Alright, you got your priorities right. I'm just trying to see if there's a game you're not playing enough. Okay, Torchlight? What's up with this? Less than an hour on Torchlight. You gotta fix that, buddy. Um, I have put in more time, but that was on my Mac. And that was, that was when I was heading down, you know, when I was heading down to Otacon on the train and I didn't even have, like, a connection, so I was playing offline. So that count, that time didn't get counted for yet. Uh, you would make Allen a very sad puppy with all these Half-Life games you own that you haven't even played yet. I know, I know, I'm guilty of that. Alright. And I'm also in between, like, Battlefield 3 and Hawks, which is, like, crapping out on me, so I had to switch up to other games. And, uh, Loki, look at this. Loki, look, look, look what he's got here, sitting in his collection untouched. Right there, you see that? Grand Theft Auto 4 and episodes from Liberty City. What do you have to say about that? Probably got him really cheap. Yes. You can do that. You know what, if I were to show you my Steam collection and you were to rate me on that same scale, you would be like, Rob, I'm taking that podcast away from you, so you have time to go play these games. Dude, I've got so many indie games that I've bought from all these Humble bundles that I have never played. We're sitting here hazing you on all the stuff you haven't played, but we are the worst when it comes to this stuff. So, you know what, buddy? It's all good. At least you're, uh, supporting these developers. Alright, one more thing. Seeing that Black Friday and the holiday shopping season is upon us, I'm kind of at a crossroads where, like, I don't know what else to invest on my 360 that isn't already out on PC and isn't already on another platform. Like, every time I go to GameStop or any video game store, I'm always hard, I'm always pressed as to trying to find something that, A, obviously isn't PC or on a PS3, and B, isn't, like, a first-person shooter. So it's kind of like finding those, like, that small scope of console exclusives that I can't really play that I wouldn't normally otherwise play on another platform. Honestly, Zaku, if Xbox Live isn't doing it for you and the community on there, and, um, you know, the indie games and some of the stuff that you can download on Xbox, uh, and all that, maybe you should think about offloading your Xbox, because yeah, when it comes to exclusives, you know, Microsoft's got, you know, again, there's Kinect. A PS3 is definitely, yeah, I know, I understand that, you know, I'm kind of contemplating it, but on the other hand, I am long overdue for a PS3. Let's just say that my girlfriend was hinting at trying to avoid, you know, telling me to avoid getting one in the next couple of weeks, so I pretty much, I can pretty much say with certainty that she's probably hinting towards getting me, you know, something like that. What a nice girl. So, I might be able to exploit that avenue in terms of playing the PS3 exclusives that I missed out on, like Gran Turismo 5, the Uncharted series, uh, Metal Gear Solid 4. No, Gran Turismo 5 never came out. Did? It's a running joke. That's not what Bobby said. That's not what Bobby said. It did, but it's like, yeah, it's kind of like that red-headed stepchild, but I mean, with GT5, I could plug in, like, a high-end racing wheel. I wouldn't be able to do a Forza, for example, since it's like, I'm not going to play with some virtual, like, wireless wheel that I have to pretend like doing air steering, which I have, which is garbage. You don't have to do air steering with Forza, though. Forza, I, you know, I, Bobby was very kind to Forza, and he wrote the review on vognetwork.com, and I know Actif's a big fan of it as well. I played the demo. I liked it, but I just spent $120 on games this week, so I won't be picking up Forza anytime soon, but I'm interested in it. Forza's pretty good for what it's worth on the 360, but in terms of actually, like, for a hardcore game, you know, for a hardcore racing gamer who wants to, like, plug in their Logitech G27 in there, which is not even possible because it only supports PC and PS3, I'm only, you know, I'm basically, like, forced to buy their, like, you know, their bullshit wireless wheel that is just like, it's just like a yoke shaped thing that just, you could just, like, hold it up and just stare, and it basically does it for you, but it's not cutting it, because it's like, I want to have that feel and the shock of actually, um, driving a car, shifting the gears, and so forth. Then go out and drive a car. Well, drive a car at high speeds without getting pulled over, sure, sure. Sure, buddy. It's worth a shot. Go to Montana, ain't no one care out there. Alright, Saku, I gotta let you go so we can wrap up the show, maybe get one more call, alright? Alright. Take care. Have a good one. Bye, you too. Alright, 1877 Game OLR, our username on Skype is OrangeLaunchRadio. I suppose we have time for one more call, but I want to do some more of these tweets here real quick, and then I'll let Loki do last minute stories. Uh, TigerClaw is sending us a couple tweets. I remember reading about this one, and for some reason, they make our show roll, but getting it out there, what, uh, TigerClaw linked us to on GamePolitics.com. Capcom can no longer make new Tatsunoko games. If you do not own the Tatsunoko versus Capcom game, uh, you better hurry up and find it in a bargain bin somewhere, because Capcom no longer holds the rights to publish Tatsunoko games. That was a limited deal, so, uh, if you're hoping- I have mine. If you're hoping for a part two, keep right on hoping. This is really interesting. TigerClaw linked into another story on, uh, uh, Twitter. I almost said Skype. He didn't link on Skype, he linked on Twitter. Foxconn rumored to be planning US plants? Isn't Foxconn that company in China that all those controversial stories- Is this a Goodwill thing, or, or what is this? But, yeah. Apparently, uh, they are evaluating Detroit and LA for new operations. Um, this is, uh- Is there outsourcing here? Are we cheaper labor? I- Hold on, I'll get back to the story in a minute, but we got one more, one more call coming in. I'll take this call, and then we'll go back to the story. Hi, you're on Orange Honest Radio. Who's this? Hey, this is Act Deft. Act Deft? What's on your mind, buddy? Well, I want to talk about Forza Horizon 2. Something that Zaku said. Uh-oh. Alright, what'd you want to say in response to what Zaku said? Uh, he says, uh, Forza isn't, or, Forza Horizon isn't made for, uh, well, playing with, playing it with a, with a real controller, er, racing controller. Mm-hmm. And he's pretty wrong on that. He's wrong? You're calling him out? Why is he wrong? Well, basically, uh, one of the, one of my friends I play, uh, Forza, uh, frequently with, he has a fantastic controller, and those controllers are, like, really expensive, uh, they have a lot of, uh, stuff that, that makes it, makes it feel like a li-, uh, you're driving a real car, so, uh, basically, you can, uh, play, uh, play, sorry, or, uh, play with a real controller, a good controller, uh, even though it, it does feel different, from, uh, even from Forza 4, but you can still play it. Now, Zaku in chat is, is clarifying, I didn't bash Forza Horizon, Forza 4 sucked ass on the 360 wireless steering wheel. Well, that's... Well, that's different. I, I, I don't know about the, the 360 controller, but you can play. Yeah, Forza Horizon, the demo played alright to me. I liked that it, it was really stupid proof, like, the demo was really stupid proof, like, I played on Easy, and it was like, here, let me break the car for you. It's like having a driving instructor sitting right next to you. I'm like, oh, this is what I needed to be able to play Forza, this is great. I'm totally, I am being totally honest. Well, uh, I have played, uh, since Forza 2, and I, and I loved it because it's so easy to pretty much pick up and play, even though, uh, it does, uh, get harder on later races for the difficulty. Sure. It's pretty much easy to play because you have so much things, uh, that help the, the driver, the player, that you can much, uh, pretty, uh, pretty much screw up a race and even though, uh, the game will help you to correct that and be a better player. So, you, you give, uh, Forza Horizon your stamp of approval as well. I know I saw Bobby gave it a good review on the site. Did you give it a good review too? Yeah, I pretty much gave, uh, the same points as Bobby, even though, uh, the difficulty in Forza Horizon can be pretty unforgiving, but it's still a great game. Uh, even single player or multiplayer, it's really good. Alright. And, uh, it looks like they just want to clarify one more thing. Not bashing the game, says Black Wolf. He's bashing Microsoft's controller standards. No, I know. I know, but like I said, if you have a good controller, it will work. Yeah, 360 does have some, some, uh, that controller does leave some things to be desired, especially when it comes to that D-pad. Alright, act deft. I'm going to let you go so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much, buddy. Okay? Thank you. Alright, take care. Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight. I'm going to close it up because we are running a little long. I want to finish up Twitter and then I'll let, uh, uh, Loki do any last minute stories or Jamie. Um, uh, that Foxconn story, let's see, it's a Digitimes report saying that Foxconn Electronics plans to set up manufacturing plants in the US, looking at Detroit and Los Angeles. Uh, market watchers are the source of the news. Uh, these facilities would be expected to handle LCD TV manufacturing. It's a simpler and more automated process. So, um, It requires a lot less suicide. Stop it. Take that with a gigantic grain of salt, but there you go. Um, one other tweet I want to read here is from Spazinator PSN on Twitter. Sky, I'm challenging to top some of my high scores in Game Room. Yes, I said Game Room. What? What's that? We're going to party like it's 2010. Woo! What's a Game Room? He's talking about Microsoft Game Room. You know, I haven't touched Game Room in a while and I should. I'm going to go back and, and I'll go back and, you know, I did spend money on a lot of those games and a lot more than I really should be admitting. So I do need to go back and show Spazinator how it's done. So, uh, fine. Challenge accepted. Probably be able to set some high scores because no one plays it anymore. Challenge accepted! Loki, any last minute stories? Uh, just a couple. There was a comment about Minecraft. They were, um, basically saying that the future of Minecraft is the consumer. And the reason that is is because one of the things that they're working on is the whole new mod interface that they're going to allow people to be able to mod Minecraft a lot easier. Because right now it's a little bit difficult. You kind of have to replace files in the jar file and stuff like that and it's just not user friendly. But they are working on new framework that's going to allow the creating and installing of mods to be easier and also, um, releasing an official editing suite. Also, they're thinking about hosting their own private servers so that they can have groups of people to build their own persistent worlds and experiment. So that's kind of neat. And then there was another comment. Ubisoft wants to get their full retail games onto the Wii U eShop as soon as possible. I can understand why because they had a good portion of the games for the Vita launch and I bet a lot of those sold digitally. Yeah, when there's nothing else to buy, your games look pretty appealing. They have a lot of games. Push button, get game. You never even have to hand anybody money. Of course, the problem with downloading the games is remember you need to have storage space which, uh, you know, really, you're only going to be able to get about one or two games on the premium model there. You're going to need an external hard drive and it's an extra step. I understand it's not necessarily an expensive step but it's still an extra step to have a hard drive to put those games on. That's it. Alright. Well that does it. It's almost a three and a half hour show tonight. Well it helps that we actually get to play the break tonight so it helps give more content on the podcast and something for the worker bees who listen to our show on Mondays and Tuesdays and throughout the week. Something to listen to. I really want to thank you all for tuning in tonight. I want to thank Eddie for coming on the show and staying for 45 minutes, close to much more than the 15 to 20 I told him it would be. So big thanks to him for coming out tonight. BimaniStyle.com I want to thank Jen from Girl Gamer Vogue for doing that interview with DJ Rama S as well. It was great to meet her through Rama and I want to thank my co-hosts for being here tonight too. You're welcome. I want to thank myself for being here. Thank you Rob. Thank you Rob because if it weren't for you I wouldn't be here tonight. I wasn't even supposed to be here today. And I want to thank the listeners for showing up through apparently seven drops of the feed. They stayed with the show tonight. I know right. We got to figure out what the hell's. And like Alan's not here so there's no bandwidth coming out of the office tonight. No I don't think it's us because I'm not getting disconnected from chat so. Something's up. I'm not running anything either so. But anyway thank you guys again for your support and if you got to the whole end of the show you're listening on the podcast you know what thank you too for listening to all three and a half hours of it. You guys rock. Of course I could be really evil and vindictive and put the pass phrase like right here at the very very end so people have to like. Oh just kidding. Boogers. No it's not. Don't listen. It's not it. Alright. Anyhow let's go around and get everybody's final thought. DarkSakura what's your final thought tonight? I just got wind a certain bit of news that I actually think is super cool. Have you ever heard of the company Bob's Red Mill? It makes like grains and cereals and gluten free stuff and. No but okay. You can find it like in the health section that type of thing. Well the owner actually just handed over the company to the employees to make it employee stock owned. Oh. Meaning that all of the stock increases go directly into their retirement funds. Nice. As a trust they can also borrow from which I wish more companies would be like that you know to work for the benefit of their employees. So just saying not all rich people are assholes I guess. Saying. Loki your final thought tonight. My car sucks. Hopefully I get a new car though. Because we're looking at new cars now. Or new to me cars. Not necessarily new cars. Less old. Not necessarily. Less mileage hopefully. I want to thank everybody for listening to the show tonight and sticking with it and remember if you like our show just tell a friend or two about the show. Help spread the word. That's all we ask. We don't charge for it or anything like that. So just help spread the word about the VoG network and what we're doing here. And that's all we want. Just help grow our community. That and vote in the podcast awards if you can. It would be nice. It would be nice too. Vote every day and then get another IP and vote there too. Don't cheat. Don't cheat. Don't cheat. Just vote enthusiastically. Just support multiple personalities. You'll never know that you voted twice. Alright stop. Alright. That does it. My final thought. I'm gonna go with an old classic. My final thought tonight. Be good to yourself. And each other. Be excellent to each other. Have a wonderful week everybody. We'll be back to do it all again next time. Same bat time. Same bat channel. Good night everybody. Welcome to Orange Lounge Radio. Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.
