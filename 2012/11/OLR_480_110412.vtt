00:14.138 --> 00:26.825
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, November 4th, 2012, Sony reports a loss of close to $200 million, details emerge on Nintendo Network Premium, and one vice president of a retail gaming company pleads guilty to embezzlement.

00:32.185 --> 00:36.868
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.328 --> 00:43.912
[SPEAKER_06]: It is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 480 for this November the 4th of 2012.

00:45.493 --> 00:49.055
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope for those of you guys that go out and do stuff on Halloween, you had a good Halloween.

00:49.855 --> 00:55.259
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can't believe it, but now is that time of year where we start seeing all the Christmas stuff show up in stores and all that...

00:57.420 --> 01:01.963
[SPEAKER_06]: and I'm sure wanting to comment on that is the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

01:02.063 --> 01:06.186
[SPEAKER_02]: I still haven't seen any Hanukkah stuff and Hanukkah is like two weeks before Christmas.

01:07.547 --> 01:08.667
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, it's not fair.

01:10.208 --> 01:12.250
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it's, it's...

01:14.937 --> 01:17.079
[SPEAKER_02]: Bigotry, it's bigotry, it's prejudice.

01:17.119 --> 01:22.823
[SPEAKER_06]: To be fair, I haven't seen any Festivus polls, so they're hating on Festivus too.

01:24.404 --> 01:24.985
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

01:26.366 --> 01:30.989
[SPEAKER_02]: I just saw a funny thing in chat, so I'm not going to say it because I'm not talking about politics.

01:31.309 --> 01:31.709
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:32.149 --> 01:32.809
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank gosh.

01:32.849 --> 01:33.130
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:33.710 --> 01:35.650
[SPEAKER_06]: Also say hello to Tech Master Loki.

01:35.910 --> 01:36.210
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

01:36.310 --> 01:37.011
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you, Loki?

01:37.131 --> 01:37.551
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm fine.

01:38.251 --> 01:38.751
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

01:39.231 --> 01:39.951
[SPEAKER_06]: What's new with you?

01:39.971 --> 01:41.512
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your week?

01:42.132 --> 01:43.172
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been all right.

01:43.352 --> 01:44.313
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of Minecraft.

01:44.553 --> 01:45.213
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of Minecraft.

01:45.233 --> 01:51.115
[SPEAKER_06]: You were showing me... Okay, tell me about this little thing you were... This was cool, this map thing you were showing me before the show.

01:51.415 --> 01:52.115
[SPEAKER_06]: How does that work?

01:52.455 --> 01:53.116
[SPEAKER_06]: Dynamic Map or Dynemap

02:20.336 --> 02:39.257
[SPEAKER_07]: and basically it's almost in real time there's a little bit of there's some glitches like I've noticed a few blocks not updating but it's pretty much in real time and it shows just everything that's on the server you can take a peek and see what people are building and just kind of how things look

02:40.543 --> 02:43.886
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe get you interested in joining up on the server because it's fun.

02:45.046 --> 02:45.947
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've got that.

02:46.187 --> 02:47.849
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, check it out.

02:48.369 --> 02:51.912
[SPEAKER_07]: You can even see when people are playing, you can see them moving around and where they're at and stuff like that.

02:52.652 --> 02:53.193
[SPEAKER_07]: You can watch chat.

02:53.253 --> 02:54.994
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of fun.

02:55.427 --> 03:11.612
[SPEAKER_06]: that's kind of neat that you can do that all live and I like being able to see kind of the like just isometric view and I even found my house on there you helped but I was able to find the house and all that yeah I haven't gotten around to labeling everything yet like some people's places I don't know who built them you know I know I was like Loki what's that

03:11.792 --> 03:12.152
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

03:12.232 --> 03:12.972
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, what's that?

03:13.132 --> 03:14.573
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

03:14.753 --> 03:15.533
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen that there.

03:15.573 --> 03:16.213
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't remember.

03:16.514 --> 03:32.839
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was one time I did see who built it, but I don't remember who it was because they were standing there idling and I just didn't remember because some people are not responsible enough to label their houses with signs so I know who's building what.

03:33.099 --> 03:35.840
[SPEAKER_07]: Your roller coaster is epic too, by the way.

03:35.860 --> 03:36.300
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty large.

03:36.320 --> 03:36.880
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't ridden it yet.

03:36.920 --> 03:38.541
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still not going to play it until someone buys it for me.

03:40.382 --> 03:46.007
[SPEAKER_06]: What she's not going to tell you is that when she saw the map and was looking at everything, she was like, okay, maybe I do need to play this.

03:47.748 --> 03:50.030
[SPEAKER_06]: She's starting to turn around a little bit.

03:50.070 --> 03:51.311
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki's magic is working a little bit.

03:51.391 --> 03:52.732
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to put my foot down.

03:52.772 --> 03:54.393
[SPEAKER_02]: When someone buys it for me, then I'll play it.

03:55.134 --> 03:57.096
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe Hanukkah Harry will bring you a copy.

03:58.777 --> 03:59.698
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd rather have the N7 hoodie

04:12.885 --> 04:13.646
[SPEAKER_06]: What stopped you from going?

04:13.686 --> 04:15.247
[SPEAKER_06]: You see all the big new movies.

04:15.687 --> 04:16.768
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't, actually.

04:16.888 --> 04:17.728
[SPEAKER_07]: You usually do.

04:17.988 --> 04:20.070
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to before I had a kid.

04:20.730 --> 04:22.971
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, well, this is a kid's movie, sort of.

04:23.111 --> 04:25.553
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I just didn't get a chance to go see it.

04:25.613 --> 04:29.815
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I still want to see it, but it's just I haven't gotten to go see it yet.

04:30.046 --> 04:30.486
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

04:55.182 --> 04:58.724
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to note, even though it looked like a Pixar movie, it was not a Pixar movie.

04:58.884 --> 05:09.409
[SPEAKER_06]: So it did not beat all the Pixar movies, but it did beat all of the Disney classics, which includes Tangled, which was also kind of that same animation style, if you saw that movie.

05:09.469 --> 05:11.951
[SPEAKER_06]: But it made $49.1 million, at least that's the estimate.

05:12.251 --> 05:14.292
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the interesting thing is they are crediting...

05:14.992 --> 05:44.438
[SPEAKER_06]: Hurricane Sandy for some of the reason why it did so well because a lot of kids didn't have school on Friday a lot of people wanted to just get away you know out of the nightmare they've been living the past week and go see a movie so they're actually saying it was part of the reason it had a little bit of a boost but I don't know I mean I just know a lot of people that I know were really interested in seeing this movie and it really did seem like the type of thing that was geared at families as well as you know

05:44.938 --> 05:46.339
[SPEAKER_02]: It had the classic stuff.

05:47.279 --> 05:48.480
[SPEAKER_02]: The classic stuff was great.

05:48.620 --> 05:50.041
[SPEAKER_02]: The references, if you caught them.

05:50.962 --> 05:51.742
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to go see it again.

05:52.983 --> 05:54.864
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to try to phrase this without spoiling it.

05:54.924 --> 05:56.545
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw it too and I had a great time.

05:56.825 --> 06:03.449
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the great thing about it is that, well, obviously I like two things and we talk about it a lot on this show.

06:03.529 --> 06:04.830
[SPEAKER_06]: Video games and Disney.

06:05.330 --> 06:06.671
[SPEAKER_06]: And this movie was really both.

06:07.331 --> 06:13.575
[SPEAKER_06]: But the neat thing about it is that it wasn't really about the video games.

06:15.086 --> 06:16.507
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

06:36.983 --> 07:02.741
[SPEAKER_06]: so I kind of think it was neat that it was this very traditional Disney story and for all practical purposes it was pretty formulaic for the rest of Disney movies not that that's a bad thing but you know it was it was it was kind of what you'd expect from a Disney movie but it took place in this universe that coexists alongside Street Fighter, Q-Bert, you know Sega games all these other things what did you think about them going to the Tapper?

07:03.723 --> 07:04.603
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I thought that was great.

07:04.643 --> 07:07.444
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there was a scene where- I thought about you when I saw that.

07:07.745 --> 07:08.785
[SPEAKER_06]: Where they referenced Tapper.

07:09.005 --> 07:11.686
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of my friends sitting next to me was like, is Tapper a real game?

07:11.766 --> 07:13.867
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, oh my God, how old are you?

07:14.107 --> 07:15.968
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I'm way older than you.

07:16.068 --> 07:17.989
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember Tapper when it was in the arcades.

07:18.649 --> 07:22.970
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan completely jumped at the, and I'm not going to say any more than this, the Road Blasters.

07:23.331 --> 07:24.151
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

07:24.793 --> 07:26.674
[SPEAKER_02]: A, Stay Till the Very, Very, Very End of the Credits

07:48.380 --> 07:50.381
[SPEAKER_06]: for a little, you know, like most movies.

07:50.621 --> 07:54.682
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a big thing, but it's one of those things that when you see it, you'll be like, oh, that's clever.

07:54.782 --> 07:55.242
[SPEAKER_06]: That's funny.

07:55.522 --> 07:55.802
[SPEAKER_06]: LOL.

07:56.763 --> 08:01.304
[SPEAKER_06]: And then also, crap, what else was I going to say?

08:01.884 --> 08:02.144
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

08:02.164 --> 08:02.644
[SPEAKER_02]: The graffiti.

08:02.985 --> 08:03.645
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, the graffiti.

08:03.865 --> 08:05.045
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep an eye out for the various graffiti.

08:05.065 --> 08:07.646
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many little jokes on the side.

08:08.246 --> 08:14.268
[SPEAKER_06]: And actually, you can see Princess Peach and Princess Toadstool are like totally in the movie, but they're like in the background.

08:15.189 --> 08:15.690
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's them.

08:15.770 --> 08:16.431
[SPEAKER_06]: It's totally them.

08:16.471 --> 08:21.458
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there was the one scene with Chun-Li walking with the two princesses, but neither of them were...

08:23.186 --> 08:23.686
[SPEAKER_02]: Peach or Toadstool.

08:23.766 --> 08:24.766
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of them was Peach.

08:24.826 --> 08:26.047
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them was in blue.

08:26.067 --> 08:27.127
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one was Daisy.

08:27.387 --> 08:28.187
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, probably Pauline.

08:28.667 --> 08:28.847
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

08:29.428 --> 08:29.888
[SPEAKER_02]: And Pauline.

08:30.388 --> 08:32.048
[SPEAKER_06]: So, very interesting.

08:32.568 --> 08:33.509
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to our chat room.

08:33.829 --> 08:38.050
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm being a very bad boy and I did not introduce our chat yet, but we do love our live chatters.

08:38.110 --> 08:39.250
[SPEAKER_06]: We love the podcast listeners.

08:39.270 --> 08:45.632
[SPEAKER_06]: We also love the people that join us live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network or vognetwork.com.

08:45.932 --> 08:51.053
[SPEAKER_06]: We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.

08:52.073 --> 08:59.838
[SPEAKER_06]: and we have a live chat room that you can chat along with us at live.vognetwork.com and GameGuru in chat says it was Daisy and Rosalina.

08:59.918 --> 09:00.698
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the name.

09:00.718 --> 09:01.519
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't think of her name.

09:01.959 --> 09:02.659
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Rosalina.

09:02.759 --> 09:03.580
[SPEAKER_02]: From Galaxy.

09:04.480 --> 09:05.501
[SPEAKER_02]: Pauline was Donkey Kong.

09:05.621 --> 09:09.864
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Pauline was Donkey Kong but I thought they retroactively made her a princess or something.

09:09.904 --> 09:11.424
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so.

09:11.444 --> 09:12.305
[SPEAKER_06]: She was wearing pink.

09:12.625 --> 09:16.527
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the same thing where everybody's like, oh, Leia's a Disney princess now.

09:16.627 --> 09:17.568
[SPEAKER_06]: Leia's a Disney princess.

09:18.048 --> 09:19.109
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think that that's funny.

09:19.369 --> 09:19.849
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.

09:20.150 --> 09:21.411
[SPEAKER_06]: Put the brakes on that chat.

09:21.451 --> 09:22.392
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get there in a minute.

09:23.593 --> 09:25.595
[SPEAKER_06]: But meanwhile, let's see.

09:25.675 --> 09:28.717
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan Shadow in our chat room says, I hate end credits crap.

09:29.718 --> 09:30.960
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate end credits crap.

09:31.160 --> 09:32.381
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you hate end credits crap?

09:32.981 --> 09:33.262
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

09:33.282 --> 09:33.822
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.

09:35.063 --> 09:37.565
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually make a habit of saying through the credits regardless.

09:38.376 --> 09:49.427
[SPEAKER_02]: because I think that a lot of people behind the scenes put a lot of hard work in the movie and that's sort of my nod to them and I hear good music I check the soundtrack listings I downloaded the soundtrack in the theater

09:52.453 --> 10:15.348
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a roommate in college that was very much like you where it was like whenever we would go to see the movies he's like nope we're not leaving till after the credits is over and it was nothing about bonus scenes or anything like that it was just no we're gonna watch the entire movie and I was like all right I guess everybody's got their thing you don't want it you don't want to get the jump on getting out of here get the parking lot all right all right we'll stay and watch credits it's fine so I think that's that's fine though

10:16.408 --> 10:20.150
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, what else did I... Let's see, some people talking about The Wizard.

10:20.731 --> 10:25.573
[SPEAKER_06]: Ragenator says, so Wreck-It Ralph was about as much about video games as The Wizard was then?

10:26.514 --> 10:28.535
[SPEAKER_06]: In a funny way, yes.

10:29.496 --> 10:39.861
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I kind of don't like acknowledging that that reference works because The Wizard was a very different type of movie and for all practical purposes, let's be real, it wasn't a very good movie.

10:41.002 --> 10:48.988
[SPEAKER_06]: We just... We remember it being awesome because we were kids and it had that look at Super Mario 3 and, you know, the Power Glove.

10:49.048 --> 10:49.769
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so bad.

10:49.809 --> 10:52.591
[SPEAKER_06]: And all that, like, commercial shit that's, like, you know, shoved down your throat.

10:53.212 --> 10:54.293
[SPEAKER_06]: Wreck-It Ralph didn't really have that.

10:54.333 --> 10:56.735
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, Wreck-It Ralph wasn't... The Wii, it wiggles.

10:56.815 --> 10:57.055
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

10:57.455 --> 11:00.476
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I did see a Wii U commercial in the theater before the movie.

11:00.496 --> 11:02.037
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the only time I've seen a Wii U commercial.

11:02.357 --> 11:03.557
[SPEAKER_06]: They only have one.

11:03.757 --> 11:07.519
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody was asking on Twitter today, like, why are there not Wii U commercials on TV and all this stuff?

11:07.539 --> 11:08.819
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, I saw one in the movie theater.

11:09.720 --> 11:12.001
[SPEAKER_06]: Putting it before Wreck-It Ralph seems like a nice place to do it.

11:12.021 --> 11:12.541
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

11:12.581 --> 11:22.305
[SPEAKER_02]: They did this thing for Cartoon Network live TV shows, and my husband was like, I miss that commercial that ran for five years with What's-Her-Face.

11:22.985 --> 11:23.425
[SPEAKER_02]: What was it?

11:23.585 --> 11:25.246
[SPEAKER_02]: The Closer or something?

11:25.686 --> 11:25.926
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

11:26.946 --> 11:56.166
[SPEAKER_06]: but then they showed the Ultimate Geek trailer because you know how lately I don't know if every theater in America does this but at least all the ones around here do they have that thing called the Fathom Events where it's like the Metropolitan Night at the Opera or I think Riff Trax does their stuff through Fathom Events but here's the big thing they're doing at the end of November they're doing two episodes of Star Trek The Next Generation in HD people cheered and everybody in the theater cheered and we're like because it's geeks show us when it's DS9 bitches

11:59.207 --> 12:01.449
[SPEAKER_06]: But just for the record, I still want to go to that.

12:01.629 --> 12:02.109
[SPEAKER_06]: Just saying.

12:02.229 --> 12:06.532
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to make plans November 29th because I love Star Trek The Next Generation.

12:07.213 --> 12:08.053
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

12:08.734 --> 12:08.994
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

12:10.154 --> 12:11.655
[SPEAKER_06]: What else did I want to say about the movie?

12:11.735 --> 12:12.076
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

12:12.556 --> 12:14.557
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked it quite a bit.

12:14.737 --> 12:22.642
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, it's not like shoving the video games in your face, but I'm really glad that this part of pop culture is just –

12:23.823 --> 12:27.464
[SPEAKER_06]: It's there and it's being acknowledged without it being niche.

12:27.884 --> 12:34.545
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's really cool now that I think there's a lot of parents out there who remember a lot of these games from when they were younger.

12:35.205 --> 12:37.706
[SPEAKER_07]: And now we need a TV series, right?

12:38.566 --> 12:41.387
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it will be interesting to see if the movie continues to do well.

12:41.487 --> 12:44.527
[SPEAKER_06]: I heard it had a very large budget, so it has a lot of money to make up.

12:44.968 --> 12:51.469
[SPEAKER_06]: But if the movie does well, which if it's had a bigger opening than Tangled and there's really not a lot of competition for the movie coming until Thanksgiving...

12:52.189 --> 12:53.670
[SPEAKER_06]: There's still another Tron movie.

13:19.670 --> 13:20.113
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hope.

13:20.496 --> 13:20.919
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hope.

13:20.999 --> 13:21.442
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope.

13:21.624 --> 13:22.530
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't doubt the other will do.

13:22.827 --> 13:23.868
[SPEAKER_06]: Star Wars Episode VII Fanboy Reaction

13:52.816 --> 13:57.939
[SPEAKER_02]: Lucas turned around and donated the money to education He's probably just ready to retire He's keeping his Marin properties

14:19.031 --> 14:31.477
[SPEAKER_02]: So the game developing building and his ranch, the Skywalker Ranch, is staying under his property, including everything that's on it, but the company itself.

14:32.038 --> 14:37.801
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he wanted to build a movie theater in Marin County, and all the people with their nose in the air said, Yeah, I want a movie theater.

14:38.061 --> 14:38.682
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

14:56.585 --> 14:59.606
[SPEAKER_06]: How will it possibly be worse than the prequels?

14:59.746 --> 15:03.788
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care if it is Mickey and Goofy, which it won't be.

15:03.868 --> 15:04.648
[SPEAKER_06]: We all know it won't be.

15:04.748 --> 15:06.829
[SPEAKER_06]: How can it possibly be worse than the prequels?

15:07.029 --> 15:09.510
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a statement, too, that it's changing the canon from the books.

15:10.190 --> 15:13.731
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I seem to remember... Who reads books nowadays?

15:14.172 --> 15:16.132
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of people that are into those damn Star Wars books.

15:16.212 --> 15:25.256
[SPEAKER_06]: I realize that people want those Star Wars books to be adapted, but I seem to recall around the time the prequels came out, there were many interviews with George Lucas where he said...

15:25.856 --> 15:30.537
[SPEAKER_06]: When he did the first trilogy, he always planned for there to be three trilogies.

15:31.018 --> 15:35.699
[SPEAKER_06]: And the recurring characters that would be in all nine movies would be C-3PO and R2-D2.

15:35.999 --> 15:41.301
[SPEAKER_06]: And there would be a trilogy before the original trilogy, and there would be a trilogy after the original trilogy.

15:41.901 --> 15:46.042
[SPEAKER_06]: And he always said that it was going to be nine movies.

15:46.122 --> 15:49.023
[SPEAKER_06]: But then when he was making the prequels, he was like, you know what?

15:49.103 --> 15:50.984
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think there's going to be anything else after this.

15:51.784 --> 15:52.905
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher last year about this.

16:10.353 --> 16:13.454
[SPEAKER_02]: They're way too old to reprise the roles unless it's like way set in the future.

16:13.634 --> 16:21.417
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, or like they said that Luke Skywalker could be the Obi-Wan Kenobi type of the new movies.

16:21.437 --> 16:22.398
[SPEAKER_06]: And that would make a lot of sense.

16:22.798 --> 16:26.879
[SPEAKER_06]: But the reoccurring characters would be C-3PO and R2-D2 because they're androids.

16:26.899 --> 16:27.740
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't die.

16:28.240 --> 16:29.160
[SPEAKER_06]: And that makes a lot of sense.

16:31.301 --> 16:33.102
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm curious enough.

16:33.742 --> 16:36.103
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, sorry, I didn't mean to get on a movie tangent, but...

16:36.443 --> 16:48.928
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, but the big thing is that if they're gonna... I mean, for them to realistically have those people play the same characters, they're gonna have to change the book canon anyway.

16:49.489 --> 16:54.351
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, honestly, the book canon was going way too crazy and I couldn't even deal with it, so...

16:55.571 --> 17:21.969
[SPEAKER_06]: Ragenator says how can it be worse this is how episode 7 can be centered around Jar Jar it can't 7 will be after the original trilogy Jar Jar will be dead in fact I want to point this out if you think that Disney's gonna fuck up Star Wars you need to go ride the new Star Tours ride because the best ending on that's because you know the Star Wars ride has the multiple endings the best ending is the one where they go to Jar Jar's planet because somebody somebody shoots him

17:23.223 --> 17:26.144
[SPEAKER_06]: Disney shot Jar Jar and you all are pissed?

17:27.064 --> 17:27.644
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, Rob.

17:27.744 --> 17:29.445
[SPEAKER_06]: Your nerd logic doesn't make sense.

17:29.565 --> 17:30.045
[SPEAKER_06]: Let it go.

17:30.185 --> 17:31.605
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, I finally got Hoth.

17:32.386 --> 17:32.746
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, did you?

17:32.846 --> 17:33.526
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome.

17:33.546 --> 17:34.446
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it is awesome.

17:34.606 --> 17:35.526
[SPEAKER_06]: The ice planet's the best.

17:36.447 --> 17:38.127
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, let's see.

17:40.228 --> 17:44.509
[SPEAKER_06]: YYR says, Star Wars Episode 7 begins with the assassination of Jar Jar Binks.

17:44.569 --> 17:45.109
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

17:46.549 --> 17:47.570
[SPEAKER_06]: No, he won't be in it at all.

17:47.590 --> 17:48.750
[SPEAKER_06]: They're just going to look past it.

17:49.290 --> 17:51.711
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe Gungan lived for hundreds of years.

17:52.171 --> 18:07.288
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100 Matt says just please don't have JJ Abrams direct the next three that would be weird because that's like the crossing the streams thing you don't cross Trek and Wars like I've seen a lot of people campaigning for Zachary Quinto to be a villain in Star Wars

18:08.209 --> 18:08.629
[SPEAKER_06]: He can't.

18:08.689 --> 18:09.630
[SPEAKER_06]: He's locked into Trek.

18:09.690 --> 18:12.071
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just, I think there is this nerd thing.

18:12.111 --> 18:13.671
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't cross Trek in Wars.

18:13.811 --> 18:14.432
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't do it.

18:14.512 --> 18:19.414
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it is completely hilarious to sing Star Trek in line for Star Wars.

18:19.954 --> 18:20.474
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying.

18:21.214 --> 18:23.235
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially when you get the cast member singing along with you.

18:24.476 --> 18:24.916
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

18:25.436 --> 18:28.637
[SPEAKER_06]: TheRobD says, Han and Leia's kids have a complete story.

18:28.717 --> 18:29.278
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

18:29.378 --> 18:32.339
[SPEAKER_06]: The books go so far into the future that the story of their kids has been told.

18:32.939 --> 18:34.259
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it would make a lot of sense.

18:34.420 --> 18:35.460
[SPEAKER_06]: I swear we'll get to games.

18:35.580 --> 18:36.641
[SPEAKER_06]: Luke Skywalker, Han and Leia's kids

18:51.795 --> 18:53.096
[SPEAKER_06]: That doesn't mean it has to be on the books.

18:53.116 --> 18:54.517
[SPEAKER_06]: The books are not being turned into movies.

18:54.537 --> 18:56.077
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as Mara Jade is in it, I'm happy.

18:56.338 --> 18:57.919
[SPEAKER_06]: The books will not be turned into movies.

18:58.239 --> 18:58.619
[SPEAKER_06]: Period.

18:58.679 --> 18:59.579
[SPEAKER_02]: Mara Jade needs to be in it.

19:00.620 --> 19:01.340
[SPEAKER_06]: You're stretching it.

19:01.461 --> 19:08.645
[SPEAKER_06]: That may happen only because they ended up calling one of the planets Coruscant in the prequels because that came from the books.

19:10.125 --> 19:12.627
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but they also referenced it in, I think, the first one.

19:13.684 --> 19:17.368
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, Tiger Claw says, how about Joss Whedon directing Star Wars?

19:17.768 --> 19:18.389
[SPEAKER_06]: I could go with that.

19:18.969 --> 19:24.214
[SPEAKER_06]: I think while that would make a lot of nerds happy, why don't you give him the time to do all this stuff with the Avengers?

19:24.354 --> 19:25.135
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, he's one guy.

19:26.036 --> 19:28.098
[SPEAKER_06]: He can't do everything nerd.

19:29.139 --> 19:29.419
[SPEAKER_06]: I would...

19:30.936 --> 19:33.697
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to see some of these, oh God, I'm going to get so much.

19:33.717 --> 19:34.797
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see Kashyyyk in it.

19:35.137 --> 19:43.860
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to get so much shit for this, but I think it would be really cool to get somebody like one of the Harry Potter directors that made the really, like.

19:43.880 --> 19:46.861
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking forward to Tim Burton's adaptation of Star Trek.

19:46.921 --> 19:47.462
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no, no, no.

19:47.562 --> 19:49.302
[SPEAKER_06]: Alfonso Cuaron, who did the third.

19:51.243 --> 19:55.824
[SPEAKER_06]: Guillermo del Toro, although he didn't do a Harry Potter movie, but he's, you know, Pan's Labyrinth and all the stuff he does.

19:56.305 --> 19:57.625
[SPEAKER_04]: Directed by Francis Ford Cooper.

19:58.130 --> 19:58.230
[SPEAKER_06]: Gloom.

20:24.025 --> 20:24.305
[SPEAKER_06]: Maniac Mansion

20:40.925 --> 20:47.870
[SPEAKER_06]: They'll probably continue to contract with other developers to do Star Wars on the consoles.

20:48.050 --> 20:51.773
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, if we're talking like Tim Burton, that is a movie that Tim Burton would be perfect doing.

20:52.333 --> 20:53.114
[SPEAKER_07]: Maniac Mansion.

20:53.414 --> 20:54.435
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that would be awesome.

20:55.575 --> 20:56.756
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, good points in our chat room.

20:56.796 --> 20:58.337
[SPEAKER_06]: Dan Shadow says ILM.

20:58.537 --> 20:59.298
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very true.

20:59.598 --> 21:01.399
[SPEAKER_06]: Tiger Claw says Skywalker Sound.

21:01.780 --> 21:03.061
[SPEAKER_06]: So Disney picks up all that.

21:03.101 --> 21:03.621
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

21:03.981 --> 21:07.424
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, I'm just going to say, how can it get any worse than...

21:09.565 --> 21:10.327
[SPEAKER_06]: Star Wars Connect Game

21:18.752 --> 21:20.093
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you played that Star Wars Connect game?

21:20.233 --> 21:22.874
[SPEAKER_07]: No, because I'm smart enough to know that it's terrible.

21:22.994 --> 21:24.194
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to remind you.

21:24.414 --> 21:25.355
[SPEAKER_06]: Be quiet, advertisement.

21:25.655 --> 21:33.578
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to remind you of a little sequence that's in the Star Wars Connect game, and that is the dance battle to I'm Han Solo.

21:33.978 --> 21:36.339
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me play a little clip of that.

21:36.499 --> 21:38.020
[SPEAKER_07]: All of the songs are equally terrible.

21:38.060 --> 21:40.801
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to remind you how bad things can be.

21:42.021 --> 21:43.142
[SPEAKER_06]: Just want to remind you of that here.

21:49.113 --> 21:50.437
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you seen this before, DarkSakura?

21:50.938 --> 21:52.242
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the Star Wars Connect game.

22:03.089 --> 22:04.971
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's going to get worse under Disney?

22:06.093 --> 22:07.274
[SPEAKER_06]: It can't get worse.

22:07.835 --> 22:08.676
[SPEAKER_06]: Famous last words.

22:09.057 --> 22:10.318
[SPEAKER_06]: It can't get worse.

22:10.438 --> 22:10.639
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

22:21.314 --> 22:28.558
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Ragenator says, just wait, Disney will buy the rights to Rocky Horror Picture Show next and then they'll blend Star Wars and Rocky Horror Picture Show and Sky would probably squeak.

22:28.598 --> 22:31.500
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that wouldn't happen because that would involve buying 20th Century Fox.

22:31.920 --> 22:35.162
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think there's laws set up for that big of an acquisition.

22:35.182 --> 22:39.825
[SPEAKER_06]: That means we can have meetings in space.

22:39.865 --> 22:40.165
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

22:40.485 --> 22:44.267
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma says, so how long before Disney makes Marvel a former shell of itself?

22:44.748 --> 22:44.848
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh!

22:46.616 --> 22:50.539
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, Disney really fucked up Marvel with that Avengers movie.

22:50.839 --> 22:52.260
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, that was terrible.

22:52.320 --> 22:54.161
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and Disney really fucked the Muppets over.

22:54.501 --> 22:57.523
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that new Muppets movie was really bad compared to the last couple.

23:00.865 --> 23:01.606
[SPEAKER_06]: Dot, dot, dot.

23:04.788 --> 23:05.188
[SPEAKER_07]: Is your mic off?

23:05.208 --> 23:06.209
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, my mic was off, sorry.

23:06.669 --> 23:08.250
[SPEAKER_07]: Now they just need to buy the Mega Man franchise.

23:09.831 --> 23:11.232
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yes to that.

23:11.652 --> 23:12.453
[SPEAKER_06]: And Blizzard.

23:13.635 --> 23:14.857
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

23:33.719 --> 23:36.444
[SPEAKER_02]: Disney still has licensing rights to Indiana Jones.

23:36.804 --> 23:40.750
[SPEAKER_02]: How else are they going to have the ride, for one thing?

23:41.131 --> 23:44.456
[SPEAKER_02]: How else are they going to have all of the merchandise that they sell at Disneyland?

23:44.597 --> 23:46.540
[SPEAKER_02]: And on top of that, they have the pinball table.

23:47.472 --> 23:54.097
[SPEAKER_06]: This is how Indiana Jones... Indiana Jones will come again, but it's going to be in about 10 to 15 years.

23:55.458 --> 24:00.542
[SPEAKER_06]: Indiana Jones is what Disney will do after the trilogy is done, and that's going to be a good 10 years away.

24:00.823 --> 24:05.406
[SPEAKER_06]: They're going to do Indiana Jones next, and it will be the good old-fashioned Hollywood fix-it reboot.

24:05.526 --> 24:06.267
[SPEAKER_06]: Just wait for it.

24:06.447 --> 24:07.788
[SPEAKER_02]: We do not want a Shia LaBeouf.

24:08.469 --> 24:08.929
[SPEAKER_02]: Reboot.

24:09.329 --> 24:10.290
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a good actor.

24:10.931 --> 24:11.731
[SPEAKER_02]: Just saying, good actor.

24:11.751 --> 24:13.353
[SPEAKER_06]: A reboot could put a good actor in the role.

24:13.713 --> 24:14.113
[SPEAKER_06]: Just saying.

24:15.394 --> 24:15.634
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyhow.

24:15.714 --> 24:17.955
[SPEAKER_02]: But as long... It needs to be done after we're all dead.

24:18.195 --> 24:18.435
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

24:19.015 --> 24:20.695
[SPEAKER_06]: Too much movies, not enough games.

24:20.796 --> 24:22.276
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about video games again.

24:22.556 --> 24:26.617
[SPEAKER_06]: We always like to start off the show, you know, 30 minutes into it, with how was your gaming week?

24:26.877 --> 24:28.918
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk about the video games that you've been playing this week.

24:28.958 --> 24:29.938
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, we'll start with you.

24:30.798 --> 24:35.219
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I actually didn't get to play much because I started a job.

24:35.939 --> 24:36.600
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a job now.

24:36.940 --> 24:37.320
[SPEAKER_02]: Congrats.

24:37.640 --> 24:38.060
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

24:38.500 --> 24:38.660
[SPEAKER_02]: And I...

24:43.928 --> 24:49.751
[SPEAKER_02]: I downloaded a demo for a game that I'm going to talk about in Part B. I never got a chance to play it because I've been working.

24:50.431 --> 24:55.253
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've been playing a bunch of Mass Effect 2 because I beat Mass Effect 1 earlier.

24:55.273 --> 24:57.134
[SPEAKER_02]: I finally did everything in the first Mass Effect.

24:57.394 --> 25:01.596
[SPEAKER_06]: So it wasn't that you played the demo because you didn't play the demo because you were working.

25:01.636 --> 25:03.957
[SPEAKER_06]: You didn't play the demo because you were playing Mass Effect 2.

25:04.057 --> 25:04.757
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's be real.

25:06.808 --> 25:07.389
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay.

25:07.549 --> 25:10.330
[SPEAKER_02]: And I logged into WoW long enough so I wouldn't get booted from the guild.

25:11.951 --> 25:16.313
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't touched WoW more than long enough to say hi to people since.

25:17.653 --> 25:20.775
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the record, I still can't get in my Mass Effect 3, just saying.

25:21.575 --> 25:22.315
[SPEAKER_06]: That's still a thing?

25:22.796 --> 25:23.276
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

25:23.476 --> 25:25.517
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched that mod ending.

25:27.855 --> 25:29.356
[SPEAKER_02]: It was terrible.

25:29.656 --> 25:35.079
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, somebody actually made a mod that will change the ending to the happy ending.

25:35.119 --> 25:37.921
[SPEAKER_06]: They call it the Mass Effect 3 happy ending.

25:37.941 --> 25:39.762
[SPEAKER_02]: The clipping issues, though.

25:39.822 --> 25:47.106
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the thing that cracked me the fuck up is that they inserted video footage, obviously, from other places in the game, but some of them had an IGN watermark.

25:47.426 --> 25:48.107
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like...

25:48.948 --> 25:49.208
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

25:49.649 --> 25:50.270
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, really.

25:50.470 --> 25:51.993
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean, that was what I was thinking.

25:52.053 --> 25:52.274
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

25:52.634 --> 25:53.416
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, yeah.

25:53.556 --> 25:57.503
[SPEAKER_02]: And on top of that, most of the footage of the space battle thing is from the low E...

26:00.949 --> 26:01.930
[SPEAKER_02]: Preparedness thing.

26:03.450 --> 26:03.831
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

26:04.131 --> 26:05.451
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know what you're talking about.

26:05.471 --> 26:06.372
[SPEAKER_06]: The universe rating.

26:06.412 --> 26:12.155
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've watched all the different versions of the endings to see what affected what.

26:12.815 --> 26:17.477
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, that's from the super low I did shit where the Normandy explodes and everyone dies ending.

26:18.198 --> 26:18.858
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, really?

26:18.878 --> 26:19.918
[SPEAKER_02]: This must be a happy ending, huh?

26:21.719 --> 26:21.999
[SPEAKER_02]: It was...

26:24.085 --> 26:27.707
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting to see it pulled off, but I'm not ready to install it.

26:27.807 --> 26:29.908
[SPEAKER_02]: I like my Destroy ending.

26:30.448 --> 26:31.429
[SPEAKER_02]: That's canon in my head.

26:32.689 --> 26:40.733
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very impressive to me that people can mod the ending and that that's a thing now, to mod the ending to make it the way you want.

26:41.033 --> 26:46.356
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just like, oh my god, the new trilogy can't get here fast enough, so people have something new to bitch about.

26:46.957 --> 26:59.366
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the whole thing is that in theory I know how it can be done because really it would be changing code to insert sequence for pre-rendered stuff and screens for all of the little flashback-y things.

27:00.727 --> 27:07.812
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it would actually be taking pre-existing animations and loading different textures over them.

27:09.337 --> 27:18.103
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, by the way, that picture of Jacob's face over Garrus' body is absolutely hilarious because he has his mouth expanded like it was for the whole Garrus face.

27:18.755 --> 27:19.336
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

27:42.318 --> 28:04.653
[SPEAKER_02]: well yeah I saw that one mod or whatever that Loki was talking about a couple weeks ago on the show that changed all the characters to other gaming franchise characters but that was it yeah this is just like you have a different frame for the animation which in Mass Effect is actually a lot easier because they all use a human skeleton but not so much in Smash Brothers so anyway

28:05.107 --> 28:08.711
[SPEAKER_06]: TheRobD in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, I'm over Mass Effect 3.

28:08.891 --> 28:12.635
[SPEAKER_06]: There's too much else to enjoy to continue bitching about Mass Effect 3.

28:13.076 --> 28:13.797
[SPEAKER_06]: Ain't that the truth?

28:14.037 --> 28:17.300
[SPEAKER_06]: And multiplayer is really great in Mass Effect 3.

28:17.441 --> 28:18.261
[SPEAKER_02]: If it works!

28:18.602 --> 28:20.884
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, on Xbox it's been great.

28:22.426 --> 28:22.886
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, anyhow.

28:23.447 --> 28:24.328
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

28:25.291 --> 28:26.613
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically Minecraft.

28:26.633 --> 28:28.895
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's what I've been doing most of the week.

28:28.915 --> 28:36.023
[SPEAKER_07]: I finally got the option to switch the server over to a bucket server, which is a server that allows mods.

28:36.163 --> 28:37.205
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what I did.

28:37.365 --> 28:39.367
[SPEAKER_07]: I have it running on a bucket server now.

28:39.427 --> 28:45.294
[SPEAKER_07]: So aside from the Dynamap thing that I talked about before...

28:46.414 --> 28:55.717
[SPEAKER_07]: We also have now WorldEdit, which is kind of cool for making structures and stuff really fast and also for leveling mountains and that kind of fun stuff.

28:56.077 --> 28:56.557
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have that.

28:56.877 --> 29:02.999
[SPEAKER_07]: And Mob Arena, which I'm setting up right now, a PvE arena where you can fight.

29:03.619 --> 29:05.200
[SPEAKER_07]: Waves and Waves of Monsters

29:27.618 --> 29:44.906
[SPEAKER_07]: so we've got a lot of work to do on that and then I'll play a little bit of Call of Duty this week and hopefully I'll be playing Black Ops 2 in a couple weeks here and that's pretty much it I think I haven't really played a whole ton this week

29:45.834 --> 29:46.994
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm kind of in the same boat as you.

29:47.034 --> 29:48.235
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't played a whole ton this week.

29:48.995 --> 29:53.277
[SPEAKER_06]: More World of Warcraft, which I'll talk about on Horde House, the other show, a little later this week.

29:53.337 --> 29:57.058
[SPEAKER_06]: But a little preview, a follow-up for those of you that do listen to Horde House.

29:57.558 --> 30:00.059
[SPEAKER_06]: Our guild did take down the first raid boss, finally.

30:00.139 --> 30:00.719
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

30:00.779 --> 30:01.539
[SPEAKER_06]: Puppies are dead.

30:01.599 --> 30:04.440
[SPEAKER_06]: And the trick was, use three healers instead of two.

30:04.780 --> 30:07.261
[SPEAKER_06]: The minute we ran it with three healers, we had it down in three pulls.

30:07.861 --> 30:09.722
[SPEAKER_06]: As opposed to, like, the 20 before that.

30:09.842 --> 30:10.962
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that was the trick.

30:11.703 --> 30:11.803
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

30:12.723 --> 30:32.320
[SPEAKER_06]: and then I did play some Mass Effect 3 multiplayer not to make this a Mass Effect show but they did have the Halloween challenge which I thought was really cute because they modded the game to make like the little beacons turned into pumpkins and the little devices that you did the upload from were all little pumpkins and you know they did that and then you had these certain little mini achievements that you get the new banner

30:32.680 --> 30:37.122
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I thought that was a pretty hefty reward because it's really hard and you have to play a lot to get a lot of those banners.

30:37.423 --> 30:39.023
[SPEAKER_06]: But the Halloween challenge unlocks a banner.

30:39.083 --> 30:41.705
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was like, oh, I want to get a banner for no particular reason.

30:41.765 --> 30:42.805
[SPEAKER_06]: My EP needs it.

30:43.266 --> 30:43.906
[SPEAKER_06]: So I did that.

30:44.166 --> 30:46.267
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, that was the Halloween challenge.

30:47.788 --> 30:49.349
[SPEAKER_06]: Screw that Vanguard challenge, though.

30:49.489 --> 30:53.331
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not doing that one because I don't really like Vanguards as much as all my friends seem to.

30:54.711 --> 30:55.792
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, this is the next, next iPad.

31:16.658 --> 31:17.358
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.

31:17.799 --> 31:22.942
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm too addicted to the Wheel of Fortune, and it's the quiz game.

31:22.982 --> 31:24.103
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that damn quiz game.

31:24.123 --> 31:28.265
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if every Dave & Buster's has it, but it's like the giant quiz machine with the three buttons.

31:29.005 --> 31:30.706
[SPEAKER_06]: We just sit there and play that for like an hour.

31:31.027 --> 31:35.769
[SPEAKER_06]: Just keep putting the tickets in or swiping the card and getting tickets.

31:35.789 --> 31:35.910
[SPEAKER_00]: No DDR?

31:37.010 --> 31:39.692
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I don't believe they have a DDR machine anymore.

31:40.272 --> 31:41.313
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Dave and Buster's never did.

31:41.353 --> 31:45.676
[SPEAKER_06]: They always only had Pump It Up, but they replaced it with a giant Connect 4 machine.

31:46.096 --> 31:49.659
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, oh my, the thing is so bright, you can see it from space.

31:49.979 --> 31:50.559
[SPEAKER_06]: It's crazy.

31:51.180 --> 31:53.641
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it's just Connect 4, whatever.

31:54.662 --> 31:56.183
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the one by us has an X2.

31:56.343 --> 31:57.964
[SPEAKER_07]: Do they?

31:58.364 --> 31:58.785
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

31:59.265 --> 32:01.126
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't have Pump, I don't think.

32:01.607 --> 32:01.947
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting.

32:02.403 --> 32:03.284
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

32:25.267 --> 32:26.728
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

32:55.267 --> 32:55.547
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.com

33:15.813 --> 33:17.614
[SPEAKER_07]: Master Chief wakes up after a long time.

33:17.634 --> 33:23.197
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's pretty much kind of... Well, a lot of it depends on what friends of mine are going to be playing Halo 4.

33:23.317 --> 33:26.799
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Halo 2 was the best because I played it with my college buddies.

33:27.720 --> 33:29.741
[SPEAKER_06]: And this was a little bit after college when that game first came out.

33:29.781 --> 33:32.403
[SPEAKER_06]: And we would have our night that we would all play Halo 2.

33:32.783 --> 33:34.544
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was just us, no strangers.

33:34.564 --> 33:35.364
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had a great time.

33:35.665 --> 33:37.886
[SPEAKER_06]: When I went to Halo 3, that kind of fell apart.

33:38.186 --> 33:39.827
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it was mostly strangers in Halo 3.

33:40.067 --> 33:40.668
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was kind of like...

33:44.310 --> 33:48.172
[SPEAKER_06]: Having my ass handed to me by strangers isn't as much fun as when it's people you know.

33:48.292 --> 33:55.777
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Bonds006 in our chatroom says, I just did Halo 1, 2, and 3.

33:56.157 --> 33:57.819
[SPEAKER_06]: Never did the ODST in Wars.

33:57.979 --> 33:59.560
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm in the same boat, buddy.

34:00.721 --> 34:02.843
[SPEAKER_06]: Ragenator asks kind of a random question.

34:02.863 --> 34:05.826
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll answer this and then we'll go into housekeeping and news.

34:06.827 --> 34:11.091
[SPEAKER_06]: Ragenator asks, Rob, say, have you ever used the games for Windows Marketplace before?

34:11.571 --> 34:17.177
[SPEAKER_06]: I ask because I'm wondering if you can use MS Points on there or do you actually have to use actual dollars and cents?

34:18.117 --> 34:45.898
[SPEAKER_06]: maybe one of the other listeners can correct me I believe it's all dollars and cents on the marketplace I don't think they use the points the only games for Windows I did download it to get that free game Tinker or whatever it was that was in there and when I was really into Game Room you had to have games for Windows for the games that you bought that played on both platforms but that's really about my extent of knowledge of Game for Windows Live so I don't know how the points work there

34:46.438 --> 34:50.241
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Microsoft across the board is moving to regular currency.

34:50.782 --> 34:56.126
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think you see the Microsoft points in the Windows 8 marketplace, for instance.

34:56.466 --> 34:59.048
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think Microsoft's transitioning away from that.

35:01.310 --> 35:05.293
[SPEAKER_06]: Although Bonds006 says, I have used the games for Windows and they will use your MS points.

35:05.494 --> 35:06.474
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe I'm wrong.

35:06.694 --> 35:08.436
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought they were transitioning away from that, though.

35:08.796 --> 35:09.757
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe it's one of those...

35:11.278 --> 35:12.199
[SPEAKER_06]: Do it while you can.

35:13.119 --> 35:19.264
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure, though, that if they do decide someday to just get rid of Microsoft Points, you can convert them somehow.

35:19.324 --> 35:20.644
[SPEAKER_06]: It's $80 to a dollar.

35:20.725 --> 35:21.245
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

35:21.385 --> 35:22.486
[SPEAKER_06]: It won't be that difficult.

35:22.666 --> 35:23.727
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wouldn't worry too much about it.

35:25.148 --> 35:25.388
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

35:27.449 --> 35:29.631
[SPEAKER_06]: Quick housekeeping and then we'll get into tonight's news.

35:30.131 --> 35:34.094
[SPEAKER_06]: So we were going to have an interview tonight with Eddie from Bomani Style.

35:34.314 --> 35:35.675
[SPEAKER_06]: He needed to postpone that.

35:35.835 --> 35:39.278
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you did not see the message on Twitter, that interview will not be happening tonight.

35:39.378 --> 35:41.259
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize if you were tuning in just for that.

35:41.619 --> 35:43.081
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you'll enjoy the show anyway.

35:43.421 --> 35:44.542
[SPEAKER_06]: We are going to reschedule that.

35:44.622 --> 35:46.083
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're doing it next week.

35:46.703 --> 35:48.304
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep an eye on our Twitter for updates.

35:48.424 --> 35:50.106
[SPEAKER_06]: I will post as soon as I have that confirmed.

35:50.366 --> 35:52.588
[SPEAKER_06]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

35:52.828 --> 35:53.909
[SPEAKER_06]: Real life things happen.

35:53.969 --> 35:55.750
[SPEAKER_06]: So Eddie had to do something else tonight.

35:56.150 --> 36:00.753
[SPEAKER_06]: The other housekeeping thing I want to mention.

36:01.494 --> 36:10.440
[SPEAKER_06]: As we mentioned in Part B last week, Orange Lounge Radio was nominated at the Podcast Awards, www.podcastawards.com, for Best Gaming Podcast.

36:11.021 --> 36:15.164
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to try really hard not to spam this like crazy.

36:15.504 --> 36:17.746
[SPEAKER_06]: We're limiting ourselves to once a day.

36:17.826 --> 36:19.587
[SPEAKER_06]: We're trying to be tasteful about it.

36:20.047 --> 36:37.800
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, we really could use the support Competition's gonna be stiff Which, you know, the good news is It seems like the indie broadcasts are the ones that really want it So an indie's probably gonna win, which is great news You know, because the corp cast, they're like Oh, what's this?

36:37.920 --> 36:38.820
[SPEAKER_06]: What's this little award?

36:38.980 --> 36:48.187
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, oh, we have money elsewhere Oh, we don't need it So they don't even bother promoting it But, you know, the indies are really trying to get the vote And that's a really good sign that one of them will win

36:48.647 --> 36:49.868
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

37:06.824 --> 37:15.373
[SPEAKER_06]: So remember you can vote once a day between now and November 15th www.podcastawards.com and we are nominated in the best gaming category.

37:15.453 --> 37:24.643
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't forget if you give them an email address that's not one that you often check, be sure to check it once every 24 hours because you have to verify your vote because they want to make sure you're a real person.

37:25.163 --> 37:30.246
[SPEAKER_06]: and please do not do anything that would get us disqualified by doing something shady.

37:30.706 --> 37:32.127
[SPEAKER_06]: So keep it legit.

37:32.167 --> 37:33.408
[SPEAKER_06]: Keep it real, y'all.

37:33.768 --> 37:40.532
[SPEAKER_06]: And most importantly, even if you're not going to vote for OLR, please consider keeping it indie because the indie podcasts need it.

37:41.493 --> 37:41.753
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

37:43.614 --> 37:44.775
[SPEAKER_06]: What else do I want to say for housekeeping?

37:44.835 --> 37:48.257
[SPEAKER_06]: Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio and Google+.

37:48.377 --> 37:49.157
[SPEAKER_06]: We're on there as well.

37:49.197 --> 37:50.338
[SPEAKER_06]: Please join our communities on there.

37:52.577 --> 37:59.801
[SPEAKER_02]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on vognetwork.com, use the passphrase random.

38:00.621 --> 38:02.062
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get into some gaming news.

38:02.462 --> 38:03.222
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, start us off.

38:03.943 --> 38:08.585
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so let's talk a little bit about 38 Studios.

38:08.625 --> 38:11.867
[SPEAKER_07]: I know everyone's familiar with the whole debacle with...

38:12.727 --> 38:15.028
[SPEAKER_07]: Kingdoms of Amalur, Reckoning, and all that stuff.

38:15.288 --> 38:25.490
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, now, apparently, the people that were behind the whole $75 million loan, 438 Studios, are being sued by Rhode Island.

38:28.010 --> 38:29.331
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's kind of interesting.

38:29.451 --> 38:32.971
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're actually going after... What was it?

38:33.172 --> 38:33.692
[SPEAKER_07]: It was...

38:35.792 --> 38:54.266
[SPEAKER_07]: Kurt Schilling, and CEO Jennifer McLean, and I guess also the former Economic Development Corporation Director Keith Stokes and Wells Fargo Securities and Barclays Capital.

38:55.527 --> 38:56.888
[SPEAKER_02]: Barclays just owned the company I worked for.

38:58.234 --> 39:06.357
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you work hard for your paychecks, and for your tax dollars to be squandered is unacceptable.

39:06.717 --> 39:13.119
[SPEAKER_07]: The board's legal action was taken to rectify this grave injustice put upon the people of Rhode Island.

39:14.980 --> 39:17.661
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're going after them for money, and...

39:20.393 --> 39:20.713
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

39:20.833 --> 39:21.633
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully they get it.

39:22.774 --> 39:24.554
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be interesting.

39:24.794 --> 39:30.236
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just trying to recoup any losses that they had because they're out $75 million right now.

39:30.356 --> 39:37.078
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to pretend to know the first thing about investment or how the money worked out in this whole mess.

39:37.498 --> 39:44.660
[SPEAKER_06]: So I am not going to be one of those pundits that's like, yeah, take them through the ringer, get them through all their worth or the other extreme.

39:44.880 --> 39:46.221
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I really just don't know.

39:47.221 --> 39:53.305
[SPEAKER_06]: I just find this shit fascinating that the state of Rhode Island is out this money.

39:53.686 --> 39:56.448
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not some private company.

39:56.948 --> 40:02.752
[SPEAKER_06]: The state is out a large amount of money because of the failure of a video game company.

40:03.172 --> 40:06.314
[SPEAKER_06]: That just kind of blows my mind in a way.

40:06.694 --> 40:13.399
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really unfortunate because it would probably make people hesitant to invest in other video game companies, but I don't know.

40:13.459 --> 40:16.361
[SPEAKER_06]: It just blows my mind.

40:17.802 --> 40:20.884
[SPEAKER_06]: TheRobD in chat says, Kurt Schilling will need to sell everything.

40:21.104 --> 40:23.526
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel bad for everyone involved.

40:24.206 --> 40:25.907
[SPEAKER_06]: And Actdeft follows that up with, yeah.

40:26.507 --> 40:33.712
[SPEAKER_06]: And TheRobD follows that up at live.vognetwork.com says, Kurt Schilling was an idiot, but he didn't have evil intentions.

40:34.293 --> 40:37.835
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura followed that up with, he'll need to sell $10 blowjobs.

40:37.995 --> 40:38.696
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't be immature.

40:39.796 --> 40:40.457
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't be immature.

40:40.497 --> 40:41.057
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

40:41.097 --> 40:43.819
[SPEAKER_07]: To recoup those kind of losses, he's going to have to sell $100 blowjobs.

40:43.839 --> 40:43.919
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop.

40:45.751 --> 40:48.455
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was just thinking $10 so that he'd actually get business.

40:50.077 --> 40:57.367
[SPEAKER_06]: TheRobD, again, some good comments in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, he has to pay for his idiocy though.

40:57.888 --> 40:59.871
[SPEAKER_06]: Actions have consequences.

41:01.049 --> 41:01.630
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

41:16.670 --> 41:19.851
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's kind of sad.

41:19.871 --> 41:35.395
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think the game was that bad, but the thing is, it's just not a lot of games do millions and millions of copies sold, and to just count on your game being like a tentpole AAA title that's huge, huge, huge, huge, it's not really realistic.

41:36.335 --> 41:42.176
[SPEAKER_06]: But the whole thing, all that being said, it blows my fucking mind that he was given the money in the first place.

41:42.676 --> 41:44.737
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, because somebody wrote him that check.

41:46.838 --> 41:49.280
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it because of the sports fame?

41:49.901 --> 41:57.867
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it because we're so fixated on sports in this country that it's like, oh yeah, when sports royalty walks in and wants to do something, we let them do it.

41:58.688 --> 41:59.909
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what's to blame?

42:00.349 --> 42:02.651
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that sports royalty in our culture?

42:03.031 --> 42:10.757
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty sure that in certain counties in California, like Hollywood and stuff like that, you could probably kill a man and get away with it.

42:10.777 --> 42:13.340
[SPEAKER_07]: They give you a gimme, and that's it.

42:13.680 --> 42:15.021
[SPEAKER_07]: It's true, it worked for OJ.

42:16.562 --> 42:21.404
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, a $75 million loan, I mean, that's... They're like, ah, you're good for it.

42:21.464 --> 42:23.405
[SPEAKER_07]: You're a baseball star, right?

42:23.505 --> 42:23.745
[SPEAKER_07]: No?

42:26.006 --> 42:28.027
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no possible way we're going to lose on this.

42:29.528 --> 42:32.169
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100 Matt in our chat says it was because he was Curt Schilling.

42:32.229 --> 42:33.089
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're saying I'm right?

42:33.770 --> 42:34.250
[SPEAKER_06]: Question mark?

42:35.891 --> 42:41.773
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, keep in mind this is the same country that's letting a convicted rapist go free.

42:42.974 --> 42:45.915
[SPEAKER_02]: And the director, the movie director...

42:48.557 --> 42:48.797
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

42:49.458 --> 42:49.918
[SPEAKER_02]: Never mind.

42:50.299 --> 42:50.879
[SPEAKER_07]: Paul W.S.

42:50.959 --> 42:51.840
[SPEAKER_06]: Anderson, I swear.

42:54.041 --> 42:54.342
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

42:55.122 --> 43:00.967
[SPEAKER_06]: And Tiger Claw follows it up saying, yeah, it's got to be because he was a baseball player and the fact he was a World Series winning baseball player.

43:01.527 --> 43:11.715
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyhow, let's just like no one give like, you know, basketball stars this kind of money either for game ideas because would they have given that money to Dennis Rodman?

43:12.275 --> 43:13.136
[SPEAKER_02]: We did have Shaq Fu.

43:15.185 --> 43:21.548
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I wonder if Shaq Fu sold as many copies, if not more copies, than Knights of Amulet.

43:22.048 --> 43:24.169
[SPEAKER_06]: At least Shaq Fu recovered its costs, maybe.

43:24.189 --> 43:26.129
[SPEAKER_07]: Shaq Fu is a concept I can get behind.

43:26.309 --> 43:29.171
[SPEAKER_06]: Shaq Fu did not put Rhode Island's $75 million into debt.

43:29.191 --> 43:29.651
[SPEAKER_06]: That is true.

43:29.691 --> 43:30.891
[SPEAKER_07]: Shaq Fu was harmless.

43:31.291 --> 43:32.692
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, pretty harmless.

43:32.772 --> 43:36.253
[SPEAKER_06]: Shaq Fu just put me 75 minutes of my time into debt.

43:36.294 --> 43:36.774
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all.

43:37.574 --> 43:38.555
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not as big of a loss.

43:38.935 --> 43:44.559
[SPEAKER_06]: Ooh, I remember the game I wanted to talk about during my gaming week before we get into this next thing since we're talking about basketball.

43:44.839 --> 43:46.040
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know what I saw at the mall?

43:46.620 --> 43:48.962
[SPEAKER_06]: A demo kiosk for NBA Baller Beats.

43:49.642 --> 43:51.764
[SPEAKER_06]: And I so badly... That looked awkward.

43:52.064 --> 43:56.347
[SPEAKER_06]: I so badly wanted to play it, but I was with my friend, Victoria, and she was judging me so hard.

43:56.367 --> 43:57.648
[SPEAKER_07]: She's like, listen, you're too white for this.

43:57.688 --> 43:58.688
[SPEAKER_07]: You're too white for this.

43:59.229 --> 44:00.209
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not going to do that.

44:00.249 --> 44:01.010
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically.

44:01.530 --> 44:04.012
[SPEAKER_02]: And thanks to SSJ100, Matt, it was Roman Pileski.

44:05.670 --> 44:07.111
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that whole thing.

44:07.151 --> 44:09.832
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, that's a bit of a mess, isn't it?

44:10.573 --> 44:12.794
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, NBA Baller Beats.

44:12.874 --> 44:15.815
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to say, say what you will.

44:15.995 --> 44:16.576
[SPEAKER_06]: Say what you would.

44:16.636 --> 44:18.036
[SPEAKER_06]: Judge me all you want.

44:18.337 --> 44:19.477
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't give a fuck.

44:20.238 --> 44:21.038
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked fun.

44:21.318 --> 44:21.818
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

44:22.038 --> 44:23.079
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked fun.

44:28.647 --> 44:33.888
[SPEAKER_07]: I can get my boss to give me the copy that we have because it's just sitting there on his desk.

44:33.908 --> 44:34.549
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to play it.

44:34.609 --> 44:35.469
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to lie.

44:35.729 --> 44:37.729
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just waiting for it to go in the clearance bin.

44:37.990 --> 44:40.030
[SPEAKER_06]: It won't take much longer.

44:40.050 --> 44:41.670
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to check fries once a week.

44:41.731 --> 44:43.871
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be a manager special before we know it.

44:45.171 --> 44:46.592
[SPEAKER_07]: Do they even have them for sale there?

44:50.362 --> 44:50.963
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, moving on.

44:51.583 --> 44:53.264
[SPEAKER_06]: Rhode Island's not the only one that's lost money.

44:54.025 --> 45:00.569
[SPEAKER_06]: Sony, talking about their finances, made a net loss of 15.5 billion yen.

45:00.589 --> 45:05.752
[SPEAKER_06]: That translates to just under $200 million in their second fiscal quarter.

45:06.113 --> 45:09.575
[SPEAKER_06]: Their gaming division has seen a year-on-year decline in profit.

45:09.935 --> 45:11.797
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a year-on-year reduction in loss of 42.6%.

45:11.877 --> 45:14.999
[SPEAKER_06]: That's an improvement over the $312 million they lost during the first quarter.

45:20.703 --> 45:27.491
[SPEAKER_06]: The company has lowered their projections for the end of the year for the PSP and the Vita sales significantly.

45:27.571 --> 45:30.154
[SPEAKER_06]: That's down to 10 million from what they originally projected.

45:30.234 --> 45:33.158
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they're going to come out too well this year to be honest.

45:34.319 --> 45:39.062
[SPEAKER_06]: Kaz Hirai in May indicated a fiscal year estimate of $10 million for the Vita alone.

45:39.502 --> 45:44.205
[SPEAKER_06]: The PS3 and the PS2 combined estimate remains untouched at $16 million.

45:44.906 --> 45:50.009
[SPEAKER_06]: On the bright side, software performance saw slight growth across the second quarter.

45:50.690 --> 45:53.952
[SPEAKER_06]: So the PS3 and PS2 sales, they've actually rose slightly.

45:54.352 --> 45:56.373
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's look at the fourth quarter lineup.

45:56.393 --> 45:58.173
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't really have any strong titles.

45:58.193 --> 46:00.934
[SPEAKER_07]: They have PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, which could flop.

46:01.194 --> 46:06.075
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's all right, but it's not going to be like Uncharted or something like that.

46:06.595 --> 46:09.616
[SPEAKER_07]: And they've got LittleBigPlanet Karting, which also could flop.

46:09.816 --> 46:11.997
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, those are both kind of mediocre.

46:12.717 --> 46:17.298
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as AAA titles go, they're not like Mass Effect or Halo.

46:17.458 --> 46:18.859
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just kind of like, huh.

46:20.239 --> 46:23.640
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll do all right, but they're not going to be these huge games that people are like,

46:23.840 --> 46:28.003
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god, I'm going to line up at midnight to go get my PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale.

46:28.284 --> 46:29.064
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a very good point.

46:29.325 --> 46:30.005
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a very good point.

46:30.025 --> 46:31.166
[SPEAKER_06]: These games are not Halo 4.

46:31.306 --> 46:35.770
[SPEAKER_07]: Or like they have the new Sly Cooper game, Thieves in Time?

46:36.971 --> 46:37.251
[SPEAKER_07]: One of those.

46:37.671 --> 46:40.193
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, so those aren't really that strong titles.

46:40.314 --> 46:41.775
[SPEAKER_07]: And look at what we have for the Vita.

46:41.795 --> 46:44.237
[SPEAKER_07]: The two big games that they've been kind of pimping for the Vita was...

46:44.737 --> 47:02.448
[SPEAKER_07]: Call of Duty Black Ops Declassified which I'm afraid is going to suck in fact I'm pretty sure it's going to suck because the guys that made it were the guys that made the really shitty Resistance game that they were also pimping out really hard and was very mediocre and in Assassin's Creed which I think Assassin's Creed Liberation is actually pretty good but

47:03.768 --> 47:04.309
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's the thing.

47:04.329 --> 47:07.970
[SPEAKER_07]: If Sony is losing this money, and Sony's not really selling Vitas like they thought they would...

47:21.756 --> 47:24.499
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we really think we're going to get a PlayStation 4 next year?

47:24.760 --> 47:26.742
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we still think that's something that's going to happen?

47:26.782 --> 47:35.031
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm really starting to think a lot of this stuff that we're hearing about game industry troubles because this is not the first we've heard of this.

47:35.091 --> 47:36.633
[SPEAKER_06]: We've heard about layoffs, etc., etc.,

47:37.694 --> 47:38.174
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

47:57.012 --> 48:02.276
[SPEAKER_07]: They're alright, but they're not like these big launch tentpole titles or something like that.

48:02.296 --> 48:03.697
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like a new Uncharted.

48:03.717 --> 48:08.441
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they had a new Uncharted last year, but it's not like a big, huge title like that.

48:08.461 --> 48:16.407
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that they're having these dev teams working on something for the next system so they have a strong launch because they know they need that.

48:18.569 --> 48:19.270
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard to say, though.

48:19.290 --> 48:22.732
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think that they're going to have to probably drop the price of the Vita pretty soon because...

48:23.783 --> 48:26.845
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not a whole ton of stuff that's really a selling point.

48:26.905 --> 48:30.186
[SPEAKER_07]: Had I not gotten one, there's not really anything that would have sold me on one.

48:30.507 --> 48:35.249
[SPEAKER_07]: Although if they announce a portable Grand Theft Auto 5 game, I'm probably going to have to buy that.

48:35.349 --> 48:37.110
[SPEAKER_07]: Any Grand Theft Auto game, I'm probably going to have to buy.

48:37.130 --> 48:38.711
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really care what system it's on.

48:39.311 --> 48:43.274
[SPEAKER_06]: YYR in our chatroom says, I played LittleBigPlanet Karting at New York Comic Con.

48:43.294 --> 48:44.114
[SPEAKER_06]: There were no lines.

48:44.154 --> 48:48.417
[SPEAKER_06]: It was actually quite fun, but I walked away thinking, will I pay $60 for this?

48:48.918 --> 48:49.158
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

48:50.178 --> 48:54.321
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob D says at live.vognetwork.com, we absolutely need a new system.

48:54.681 --> 48:57.263
[SPEAKER_06]: That said, we also need to reevaluate the game industry.

48:57.363 --> 49:01.266
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem is that companies only change things up when we get new systems.

49:01.306 --> 49:03.967
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that's kind of along the same line I'm thinking of.

49:04.608 --> 49:07.630
[SPEAKER_06]: Not so much that we absolutely need a new system, but the whole...

49:08.470 --> 49:11.472
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of think the PS3's potential hasn't really been realized.

49:12.373 --> 49:18.157
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the PS3 does 3D gaming, but is that really a thing that people are doing right now?

49:18.337 --> 49:18.537
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

49:19.158 --> 49:22.560
[SPEAKER_06]: So what is the PS4 going to bring us that the PS3's not doing?

49:22.580 --> 49:27.243
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to understand, they've already kind of gotten away from trying to promote 3D as a big thing now.

49:27.263 --> 49:29.104
[SPEAKER_07]: They don't even really mention it too much anymore.

49:29.485 --> 49:34.248
[SPEAKER_07]: And even with 3D TVs, people aren't really sold on 3D TVs, so now they're pushing that whole 4K thing.

49:34.948 --> 49:39.789
[SPEAKER_06]: The Ultra HD TVs So is that going to be the PlayStation 4's big thing?

49:39.849 --> 49:56.574
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think that was one of the rumored specs is it's going to do that 4K resolution thing But if the PlayStation 3 couldn't get people to adopt 3D successfully Although, to be fair, Blu-ray probably won in large part to the PlayStation 3

49:58.900 --> 50:15.707
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, for every maybe failure, you could say that there's been a win But I'm just not convinced that people are going to be like, oh, I need this PlayStation 4 right fucking now Oh, and I need a new Sony Ultra HD TV as well to play... what?

50:16.107 --> 50:23.330
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you're going to think that any games that are coming out at launch are probably just going to be... They're probably not going to be utilizing that

50:25.867 --> 50:26.128
[SPEAKER_06]: One more.

50:26.288 --> 50:27.709
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me do one more comment here from chat.

50:27.749 --> 50:29.310
[SPEAKER_06]: The chat's got a lot of good points tonight.

50:29.450 --> 50:35.615
[SPEAKER_06]: YYR says, I really think that smartphones and the sort of success of the 3DS have killed the Vita's potential market.

50:36.075 --> 50:40.398
[SPEAKER_06]: I really think it's a great system and I'm really enjoying the game library despite its small size.

50:40.799 --> 50:45.062
[SPEAKER_06]: But how many people want one if they have smartphones, a 3DS, or both?

50:45.943 --> 50:47.664
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even touch my DS at all.

50:47.824 --> 50:48.845
[SPEAKER_02]: I play on my phone.

50:49.507 --> 50:52.048
[SPEAKER_06]: I would argue that the 3DS is kind of hurting too.

50:52.188 --> 50:54.588
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we're hearing a very similar story out of Nintendo.

50:54.608 --> 50:59.169
[SPEAKER_06]: It might not be as dire, but Nintendo's lowered expectations of 3DS sales as well.

51:00.329 --> 51:12.912
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do think you're onto something that a lot of it has to do with tablets, smartphones, which is why when you bring out your device and you say it plays Netflix, that was a waste of breath.

51:14.332 --> 51:20.694
[SPEAKER_06]: The fact that your device, Wii U, plays Netflix, that's an expectation now.

51:21.694 --> 51:24.915
[SPEAKER_06]: That's as much of an expectation of it does widescreen.

51:25.815 --> 51:27.516
[SPEAKER_06]: It does HD.

51:27.616 --> 51:28.436
[SPEAKER_06]: It does Netflix.

51:28.836 --> 51:30.176
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like a baseline thing now.

51:30.897 --> 51:35.838
[SPEAKER_06]: So what makes your device better than...

51:36.738 --> 51:42.022
[SPEAKER_06]: A tablet or a smartphone that, you know, far more people have in their pockets and so forth.

51:42.342 --> 51:44.583
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a big part of it, too.

51:45.244 --> 51:46.625
[SPEAKER_06]: iPad Mini ain't gonna help.

51:48.006 --> 51:48.806
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna be honest.

51:48.846 --> 51:58.172
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, like, I've got a smartphone and I have an iPod Touch, you know, 4G, and I don't really use either of them for gaming.

51:59.693 --> 52:00.414
[SPEAKER_07]: Just don't.

52:00.534 --> 52:02.215
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, even, like, my portable systems.

52:02.255 --> 52:06.098
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kind of reevaluating whether I even need portable gaming systems because I don't.

52:06.718 --> 52:07.599
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

52:23.088 --> 52:31.190
[SPEAKER_07]: We used to play on the PSP because it was portable and we could get a group of people together and play Grand Theft Auto and stuff.

52:31.471 --> 52:42.114
[SPEAKER_07]: That may be a case where I'd want a system like that to play Grand Theft Auto or some multiplayer game so that we can move around and stuff, be a little bit nomadic.

52:42.694 --> 52:42.874
[SPEAKER_07]: But

52:44.075 --> 52:48.019
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't find the need to have that stuff anymore, it seems like.

52:48.139 --> 52:54.146
[SPEAKER_07]: Even with all the systems, I don't really feel the need, next generation, to own all of the systems.

52:56.068 --> 52:59.772
[SPEAKER_07]: Even before, I felt this expectation because I do this show, oh, I should own all of them.

53:00.240 --> 53:03.601
[SPEAKER_07]: Nope, not really feeling it anymore because I don't play the Wii at all.

53:03.781 --> 53:05.282
[SPEAKER_07]: The Wii is literally collecting dust.

53:05.322 --> 53:07.362
[SPEAKER_07]: I have something stacked on top of it and that was it.

53:07.862 --> 53:11.684
[SPEAKER_07]: We dusted off the other day just to play Sight Truck.

53:11.744 --> 53:12.664
[SPEAKER_07]: I should say my wife did.

53:13.164 --> 53:17.585
[SPEAKER_07]: But I haven't played anything on that for years now.

53:17.985 --> 53:19.366
[SPEAKER_07]: And the PlayStation 3, same thing.

53:20.466 --> 53:26.048
[SPEAKER_07]: We're looking at maybe using the PlayStation 3 for Grand Theft Auto V because it doesn't get disconnected through our firewalls quick, but

53:26.728 --> 53:29.889
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't played anything on that for like a long time.

53:31.969 --> 53:32.669
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie, quick thought?

53:33.270 --> 53:49.173
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was just saying I haven't really... I mean, Dan and I have actually talked about downsizing our collection, you know, because really it's anything that we've wanted to play, I can get on my PC and I can upgrade my PC at any point.

53:50.534 --> 53:52.194
[SPEAKER_02]: It just really isn't, you know...

53:54.283 --> 54:03.230
[SPEAKER_02]: and the other thing too is also look at in terms of the economy people I think this has been the case for us are really looking at needs versus wants

54:04.167 --> 54:05.487
[SPEAKER_02]: A gaming system is a want.

54:05.507 --> 54:06.828
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something you need.

54:07.768 --> 54:08.789
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to pay rent.

54:09.389 --> 54:12.410
[SPEAKER_02]: And that became the priority.

54:13.230 --> 54:15.311
[SPEAKER_02]: I wasn't working at the time.

54:16.071 --> 54:17.852
[SPEAKER_02]: Any of my money couldn't go towards games.

54:17.972 --> 54:20.012
[SPEAKER_02]: It went towards buying food, paying bills.

54:20.852 --> 54:23.413
[SPEAKER_02]: And in this case... Damn responsibility.

54:23.513 --> 54:23.813
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn it.

54:23.853 --> 54:31.196
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, but if you look at it, the vast majority of people have been put into the circumstance, instead of having disposable income...

54:31.676 --> 54:34.843
[SPEAKER_02]: They're realizing that, yeah, maybe I don't need this stuff.

54:34.983 --> 54:36.206
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's just a bonus.

54:37.239 --> 54:38.679
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me read a few more comments from chat.

54:38.699 --> 54:41.860
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll end on these chat comments and go on into DarkSakura's next story.

54:42.560 --> 54:45.000
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's such a good discussion going on in chat tonight.

54:45.020 --> 54:47.301
[SPEAKER_06]: I just got to throw these out there for the podcast listeners to hear.

54:48.041 --> 54:52.462
[SPEAKER_06]: YYR says, The 3DS can also fall back on Nintendo's excellent software.

54:52.522 --> 54:53.722
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't forget Pokemon.

54:54.122 --> 54:58.803
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't really had a... The Pokemon games that just came out were for the last DS, which is fascinating.

54:58.823 --> 55:01.884
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how confident that they were that those games were going to do well on the 3DS.

55:01.924 --> 55:03.224
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're probably right, to be fair.

55:03.784 --> 55:06.866
[SPEAKER_06]: Dungeon Buster says, I think I butchered that sentence there, but just the whole thinking ahead point.

55:28.421 --> 55:53.390
[SPEAKER_06]: and lastly Doom Plague says I would be surprised if anyone made a 4k resolution game in the next 10 years it's a non-factor this coming generation all right we could talk about this for a lot longer but I think this discussion is going to be continuing through the next six months right on up to the next E3 when we know what these systems if they're coming at all for one and what they will entail in the meantime let's go to DarkSakura with the next story

55:53.564 --> 55:55.665
[SPEAKER_02]: How about a tale of some corporate fucking greed?

56:00.548 --> 56:09.294
[SPEAKER_02]: Frank Christopher Oliveira, who is the former GameStop VP of Corporate Communications and Public Affairs, got caught.

56:10.014 --> 56:13.957
[SPEAKER_02]: He pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud for embezzling $1,965,900 from GameStop.

56:18.961 --> 56:31.362
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the indictment, he sent payments from January 2009 through April 2011 to Cloud Communications LLC, which was a fictitious company he owned to transfer funds into his personal account.

56:35.432 --> 56:42.497
[SPEAKER_02]: GameStop is no comment, however they are fully cooperating with the federal investigation.

56:43.437 --> 56:49.822
[SPEAKER_02]: He pleaded not guilty and the max sentence to this is 20 years in prison and $250,000 fine.

56:52.143 --> 57:14.601
[SPEAKER_02]: and I hope that he gets the max you know penalty I wish that all of these corporate bastards who steal money from the companies they work for and get away with you know fraud and stealing money out of the consumers pockets get caught too instead of being given you know personhood and all this bullshit just saying people need to be held accountable

57:15.200 --> 57:15.601
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com

57:26.025 --> 57:34.591
[SPEAKER_02]: Just another sign of how people in positions of power in companies are really abusing their positions.

57:35.311 --> 57:40.495
[SPEAKER_02]: And in return, who has to pay for recouping those losses?

57:40.555 --> 57:42.996
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes back to the consumer when they're figuring out their money's missing.

57:43.577 --> 57:46.939
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma makes a very tongue-in-cheek comment in our chatroom, but it's worth repeating.

57:47.319 --> 57:48.500
[SPEAKER_06]: Steal from GameStop?

57:48.760 --> 57:50.481
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, they've stolen from me enough times.

57:51.582 --> 57:55.705
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but this is a guy who probably already is a millionaire.

57:57.224 --> 58:05.429
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to remember this is a guy who was feeding money that they already got from you into these fake companies and what have you.

58:05.669 --> 58:08.451
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just amazing he was able to do that much.

58:08.711 --> 58:11.552
[SPEAKER_02]: I want them to nail his ass to the wall.

58:13.593 --> 58:15.094
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes back to a bigger problem.

58:15.595 --> 58:23.319
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes back to more people looking at their own personal greed as opposed to being a better person maybe.

58:23.519 --> 58:25.444
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you saying look at your life, look at your choices?

58:25.485 --> 58:26.828
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, look at your life, look at your choices.

58:27.249 --> 58:28.493
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be a corporate douchette.

58:29.876 --> 58:30.578
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, fair enough.

58:30.679 --> 58:31.360
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, let's move on.

58:32.398 --> 58:32.698
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

58:34.059 --> 58:43.022
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's talk a little bit about one game I'm very looking forward to, and that would be Grand Theft Auto V. And of course... Since when were you a Grand Theft Auto fan?

58:43.382 --> 58:45.123
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just getting on the bandwagon.

58:45.163 --> 58:46.363
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a long time.

58:47.384 --> 58:54.666
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm gearing up because this month is going to be a lot of news for Grand Theft Auto V. I bet you suddenly became a Giants fan last week, too.

58:54.967 --> 58:58.288
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I had to become a sports fan first, so that's not going to happen.

58:59.188 --> 59:02.850
[SPEAKER_07]: Grant the Thought of Five, of course, there was a whole bunch of rumors of when it is expected to come out.

59:02.950 --> 59:09.514
[SPEAKER_07]: I've already said that it's going to be April or May next year, but they've officially confirmed that, yes, spring 2003 is going to be the release window for the game.

59:09.914 --> 59:18.759
[SPEAKER_07]: And they have some promotional materials that are making it out to GameStops and other places, including Game and stuff internationally.

59:19.479 --> 59:22.721
[SPEAKER_07]: and along with that, some of the promotional stuff.

59:23.081 --> 59:29.425
[SPEAKER_07]: Starting on Monday, November 5th, you can actually pre-order the game from different locations.

59:30.005 --> 59:40.130
[SPEAKER_07]: The rumor was that they were supposed to be doing another trailer on the 5th, although because of the whole hurricane slash storm, it's put them a little bit behind as far as getting that trailer cut.

59:40.231 --> 59:44.533
[SPEAKER_07]: So expect the trailer next week, which I'm really expecting for next week.

59:45.153 --> 01:00:03.668
[SPEAKER_07]: and they've got some cool little promotional items if you're able to pre-order your game early enough because it's going to be extremely limited supplies you can get a keychain type thing that has like almost like a little viewfinder on there and you can check out some of the locations including they've got Vinewood Hills which is like Hollywood and

01:00:04.388 --> 01:00:26.708
[SPEAKER_07]: The Del Perro Pier, like Santa Monica The Vespucci Canals, I guess that's kind of like a downtown LA Grape Seed, which is kind of like Napa Oh boy So it looks interesting Because Napa is so close to LA

01:00:27.887 --> 01:00:42.809
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever you know it's just like well San Andreas they had San Francisco Vegas and yeah I know I know it's it's a video game exactly it's all fixed it's all fictitious anyway so right right um and then they've got new posters and stuff like that with like a Lindsay Lohan looking woman on the front

01:00:43.490 --> 01:00:44.670
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

01:01:06.895 --> 01:01:07.495
[SPEAKER_06]: Very excited.

01:01:08.476 --> 01:01:11.377
[SPEAKER_06]: Trying to take your mind off of some of the holiday games that are coming out right now.

01:01:11.817 --> 01:01:13.337
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking forward to spring.

01:01:13.517 --> 01:01:20.880
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm only picking... The last game I'm picking up this... Well, actually, I should say not the last game, but the second to last game I'm picking up this year is Black Ops 2, followed by Far Cry 3.

01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:23.201
[SPEAKER_07]: So those will be the last two games I'm getting.

01:01:23.421 --> 01:01:25.842
[SPEAKER_07]: And then maybe Halo 4.

01:01:25.882 --> 01:01:26.202
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

01:01:26.222 --> 01:01:26.482
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

01:01:27.162 --> 01:01:30.263
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, there are going to be a lot of people picking up Halo 4 this week.

01:01:30.323 --> 01:01:35.925
[SPEAKER_06]: Believe it or not, it's here because, you know, the election day is this week and it's the same day Halo 4 is being released.

01:01:36.465 --> 01:01:39.766
[SPEAKER_06]: And retailers everywhere are going to be doing midnight releases.

01:01:39.806 --> 01:01:41.287
[SPEAKER_06]: GameStop is one of those retailers.

01:01:41.327 --> 01:01:44.048
[SPEAKER_06]: They did announce this week 4,400 of their U.S.

01:01:44.088 --> 01:01:47.409
[SPEAKER_06]: locations will be open at midnight to sell Halo 4.

01:01:48.409 --> 01:01:54.011
[SPEAKER_06]: All the stores that are participating in the event will start their events at 9 o'clock in the local time zone.

01:01:54.511 --> 01:02:01.033
[SPEAKER_06]: Do keep in mind, if you're in an area that was impacted by Hurricane Sandy, that may have screwed up some of these GameStops.

01:02:01.053 --> 01:02:02.673
[SPEAKER_06]: There's still a lot of places without power.

01:02:03.093 --> 01:02:06.214
[SPEAKER_06]: So when in doubt, call ahead and just make sure.

01:02:07.274 --> 01:02:13.916
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably if your store did Assassin's Creed 3, it's probably doing Halo 4, but it's always best to just call ahead.

01:02:13.936 --> 01:02:15.296
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing wrong with placing a phone call.

01:02:15.316 --> 01:02:20.698
[SPEAKER_06]: If the store that you pre-ordered your game happens to be a playing trade, you're not getting it at midnight.

01:02:22.678 --> 01:02:23.279
[SPEAKER_06]: All righty then.

01:02:23.679 --> 01:02:30.646
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I do want to point out, even though GameStop, there's probably a shit ton of other retailers doing the midnight release as well.

01:02:31.306 --> 01:02:42.256
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure Walmart's, Best Buy's probably, and basically any place that sells video games will probably be open at midnight because Halo 4 is kind of a big deal.

01:02:43.277 --> 01:02:50.321
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, one other thing I want to talk about with Halo 4 is this interesting little report that's going around the internet this week.

01:02:52.462 --> 01:03:03.067
[SPEAKER_06]: 343 Industries apparently not happy with some of the language that players use when they're playing Halo, to which I say, good, make the shit talkers take some accountability.

01:03:04.307 --> 01:03:15.451
[SPEAKER_06]: The studio head of 343 Industries, Bonnie Ross, in an interview with GameSpot said, "...I've seen many of the sites that have documented some of the more gender-specific, slanderous comments.

01:03:15.951 --> 01:03:20.033
[SPEAKER_06]: This is behavior that is offensive and completely unacceptable.

01:03:20.493 --> 01:03:25.275
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to think most of our Xbox Live players don't support this kind of behavior."

01:03:27.998 --> 01:03:30.800
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, just like most of them.

01:03:31.101 --> 01:03:32.382
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the best name ever.

01:03:33.002 --> 01:03:33.262
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:57.421
[SPEAKER_06]: Microsoft can't exactly monitor live games, can they?

01:03:57.521 --> 01:03:57.701
[SPEAKER_06]: Well,

01:04:25.598 --> 01:04:26.419
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they have a way.

01:04:42.142 --> 01:04:47.806
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I read this story at Destructoid, destructoid.com, and they bring up a really good point that I think is worth repeating.

01:04:47.866 --> 01:04:53.049
[SPEAKER_06]: They take issue with the fact that adolescents are the only ones being targeted as being jerks online.

01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:55.511
[SPEAKER_06]: And they say in this article, quote,

01:04:58.453 --> 01:05:26.746
[SPEAKER_06]: Who get their jollies by going into online games and being nasty Or who attempt to bully others because of perceived differences I think that's a damn good point Wasn't there a story around the internet this week or maybe last week About the Reddit trolls and the people posting the really, really bad stuff to Reddit And they traced it back to some 39-year-old guy Just one of your stereotypical basement-going people with nothing better to do And it bears to be repeated

01:05:27.586 --> 01:05:45.451
[SPEAKER_07]: Halo 4 is a fucking mature rated game so kids shouldn't be playing in the first place but parents are fucking dumb or I should say parents have made the choice to have their kids play this mature rated game at that same time they should also be responsible for what they say or what they're exposed to

01:05:47.135 --> 01:06:03.374
[SPEAKER_06]: Bonds006 in our chatroom says people still cry over what's being said online in a game I'm not sure if I'm taking that like if there's like a hint of sarcasm or something to that comment but like yes and people should take issue to some of the things that are said online in a game like I'm sorry but

01:06:04.034 --> 01:06:10.456
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been in Halo matches where I've heard people called faggot and far worse words I'm not going to say on this show.

01:06:11.136 --> 01:06:13.256
[SPEAKER_06]: Although they're all bad, let's be real.

01:06:13.676 --> 01:06:18.217
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's just like, yes, I take issue to that.

01:06:18.477 --> 01:06:24.719
[SPEAKER_06]: As a gay guy who got called that a lot growing up in a very malicious way, who still has many...

01:06:25.459 --> 01:06:26.860
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.com

01:06:53.595 --> 01:06:54.335
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:07:12.907 --> 01:07:26.532
[SPEAKER_06]: The Big C-Bomb, then that better be a term of endearment or some prearranged thing and not in a negative thing because that's not okay to be calling women at random that word.

01:07:26.972 --> 01:07:27.452
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

01:07:28.572 --> 01:07:32.394
[SPEAKER_06]: Or even bitch, whore, slut, all those other things.

01:07:33.694 --> 01:07:34.194
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, Jamie?

01:07:35.235 --> 01:07:36.255
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of not bothered.

01:07:37.515 --> 01:07:42.497
[SPEAKER_06]: So you don't care if you go online and do a random match on Halo 4 and somebody drops the C-Bomb?

01:07:43.530 --> 01:07:43.690
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

01:07:45.071 --> 01:07:52.094
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because really all I'll do, like, for example, it actually happened in WoW not too long ago, and all I did was just report and put them on ignore.

01:07:52.154 --> 01:07:52.734
[SPEAKER_02]: What about my game?

01:07:53.975 --> 01:08:03.659
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, okay, then it didn't get under your skin, but you recognize that, hey, this person should probably have their freedom to play the game taken away from them, right?

01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:05.420
[SPEAKER_06]: This person is not mature enough to be in this game.

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:08.182
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that their ability to speak in said game should be revoked.

01:08:08.442 --> 01:08:08.622
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

01:08:09.442 --> 01:08:15.466
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't necessarily think they shouldn't be allowed to play the game because maybe they're good at it.

01:08:16.026 --> 01:08:18.568
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think that their ability to speak should be revoked.

01:08:19.409 --> 01:08:24.052
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because that's almost more frustrating is not being able to say something to somebody.

01:08:24.732 --> 01:08:35.319
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, honestly, I like when you have a feature to just actively ignore something and then have it pop up reverting to them.

01:08:36.259 --> 01:08:37.360
[SPEAKER_02]: X person has you ignored.

01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:54.376
[SPEAKER_02]: then what good is saying anything going to do when the person that you're saying it at can't react isn't going to react to it the people are only doing that for attention they're only doing that because they get something off on it if you're not if they're not bothered by it what good is it going to do

01:08:55.342 --> 01:08:59.643
[SPEAKER_06]: I seem to remember Halo 3 had a really quick way to block people like that.

01:08:59.743 --> 01:09:08.945
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember reporting on some of the stories that you could just hit the back button and it just shut them up automatically, which I thought was pretty neat.

01:09:10.025 --> 01:09:16.507
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I think it should be, but I think that they also need to get the feedback in return that this person isn't paying attention to you.

01:09:17.612 --> 01:09:24.018
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that they should because actually it's better if they don't know that because then they can't go, oh, you're not going to listen to me.

01:09:24.178 --> 01:09:25.699
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to send an angry message at you.

01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:27.661
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it should completely block them.

01:09:30.263 --> 01:09:33.586
[SPEAKER_06]: TheRobD, I think this is a very interesting point in chat.

01:09:33.606 --> 01:09:34.526
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to throw this out there.

01:09:34.626 --> 01:09:35.707
[SPEAKER_06]: Live.VogNetwork.com.

01:09:35.747 --> 01:09:44.435
[SPEAKER_06]: TheRobD says, the only way we can improve the quality and diversity of gamers online is to hold them accountable for what they do.

01:09:45.211 --> 01:09:45.892
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:10:03.204 --> 01:10:11.190
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely hold people accountable, but I'm saying that it's kind of hard for me to try to think of how to phrase it.

01:10:11.931 --> 01:10:18.856
[SPEAKER_02]: There are really thin-skinned people out there who, you know, even just saying, oh, you suck is going to piss them off.

01:10:19.496 --> 01:10:23.379
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's going to make them, you know, be in a world of boohoo.

01:10:23.439 --> 01:10:25.981
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe if they're that thin-skinned, they shouldn't play.

01:10:27.471 --> 01:10:28.572
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I see what you're getting at.

01:10:28.812 --> 01:10:38.476
[SPEAKER_06]: You're saying that maybe this opens the door to that total political correctness, hypersensitivity, these types of issues.

01:10:38.536 --> 01:10:40.396
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, where do you draw the line?

01:10:40.737 --> 01:10:54.242
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think we can all agree you don't say certain words ever online, but somebody who might be ultra-religious, grew up in Little House on the Prairie...

01:10:54.582 --> 01:11:01.315
[SPEAKER_06]: has every right to play the same Xbox games you do, but would never say the word damn themselves and might take offense to that.

01:11:02.398 --> 01:11:11.082
[SPEAKER_02]: I know people who, like a lady in one of my classes who is as Mormon as Mormon can be, doesn't drink coffee, none of that, and she's perfectly fine with other people.

01:11:11.362 --> 01:11:15.323
[SPEAKER_02]: She doesn't, you know, she doesn't go la la la la la when someone says crap, you know.

01:11:16.024 --> 01:11:18.324
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, she won't do that thing herself.

01:11:18.765 --> 01:11:23.687
[SPEAKER_02]: And she won't put herself in a position to where she's surrounded by it all the time.

01:11:24.367 --> 01:11:29.249
[SPEAKER_02]: And now if she's in a situation that she can't get away from, she understands and accepts that that's a situation she can't get away with it.

01:11:30.449 --> 01:11:31.770
[SPEAKER_02]: Get away from it, you know what I mean?

01:11:32.450 --> 01:11:40.513
[SPEAKER_02]: And my big problem, and this actually sort of goes back to the whole big political correctness thing, you know what I mean?

01:11:41.834 --> 01:11:48.637
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that there are people who do take shit way too seriously.

01:11:49.077 --> 01:11:56.160
[SPEAKER_02]: Now there's just some people who, you know, maybe in a moment of frustration are like, well, shit, you suck, you know, I'm just using something, you know?

01:11:56.440 --> 01:12:00.002
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard Dan drop a C-bomb at a game.

01:12:00.683 --> 01:12:03.404
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he will stop and go, oh my god, I didn't mean to say that.

01:12:03.965 --> 01:12:04.265
[SPEAKER_06]: You know?

01:12:06.106 --> 01:12:07.447
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's the question.

01:12:07.527 --> 01:12:13.431
[SPEAKER_06]: Did he say it in frustration to an NPC, the verbal equivalent of throwing the controller out the window?

01:12:13.971 --> 01:12:16.893
[SPEAKER_06]: Or did he actually press the push-to-talk button and call somebody?

01:12:17.613 --> 01:12:18.574
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't do that.

01:12:18.654 --> 01:12:24.418
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan is a lot... But he'll go, oh, that was a fucking shit move when he's playing online.

01:12:24.478 --> 01:12:26.599
[SPEAKER_02]: He plays Borderlands with his buddies.

01:12:27.219 --> 01:12:31.202
[SPEAKER_02]: But the point with it is that I think there's a very...

01:12:35.650 --> 01:12:40.571
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying to think of how to... There is a lot of room for...

01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:46.422
[SPEAKER_02]: Oversensitizing things, you know what I mean?

01:12:46.862 --> 01:13:01.872
[SPEAKER_06]: There would be opportunity to take action against somebody that you don't like for other reasons Like taking advantage of it to get somebody punished Just because you want to punish for something that has nothing to do with the game, right?

01:13:02.673 --> 01:13:10.358
[SPEAKER_02]: If it was going to be... I would rather have a strike rule I'm going to go way back and go to DDR Freak

01:13:12.414 --> 01:13:14.383
[SPEAKER_06]: You think the nine point system should be universal.

01:13:15.347 --> 01:13:16.010
[SPEAKER_06]: Explain the system.

01:13:17.122 --> 01:13:23.848
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a 9 point rule, which basically for horrible offenses, then yeah, they would get docked 3 points.

01:13:24.108 --> 01:13:25.209
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a 3 strike.

01:13:25.550 --> 01:13:30.014
[SPEAKER_02]: 3 really bad offenses, and yeah, they got banned after 9 points.

01:13:31.235 --> 01:13:43.346
[SPEAKER_02]: But if there were very minor offenses, like maybe something that was mildly inflammatory or maybe unintentionally flaming, then yeah, they got basically a 1 point warn for it.

01:13:43.926 --> 01:14:07.908
[SPEAKER_02]: and I don't think that it was the warnings that could go like a person could bring something to my attention as a moderator and I'd make a judgment call if I got five things about one person from the same person I'd only warn once because clearly there's something more going on and if it seems like it's legit I'll do the full three point warning for all five offenses you know that example that was my mentality towards it

01:14:08.949 --> 01:14:21.794
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're going into, you know, if you say that you've got somebody who's really oversensitive playing their first round of Halo 4 forever and someone, you know, just...

01:14:23.613 --> 01:14:25.874
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's out, you know, oh, that was fucking cheap.

01:14:26.014 --> 01:14:29.155
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, makes one statement, oh, you don't know how to play.

01:14:29.675 --> 01:14:30.936
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going mild with it.

01:14:31.356 --> 01:14:36.037
[SPEAKER_02]: And that person gets really butthurt and says, oh, you said something offensive to me.

01:14:36.778 --> 01:14:46.061
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, even in the case of constructive criticism, because I've seen people in WoW, when you try to give them feedback on how they're playing, and they go completely off on you.

01:14:46.121 --> 01:14:48.482
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't tell me how to fucking play my character, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:14:48.882 --> 01:14:51.843
[SPEAKER_02]: When really the person was just giving really good constructive feedback.

01:14:52.803 --> 01:14:53.404
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:15:16.519 --> 01:15:17.960
[SPEAKER_02]: There's people like that in the world.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:24.687
[SPEAKER_02]: People who will take offense to any little thing and go on a fucking rampage trying to prove that they're right.

01:15:26.128 --> 01:15:26.729
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know what I mean.

01:15:27.490 --> 01:15:30.633
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we have so many stupid lawsuits go into effect.

01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:33.235
[SPEAKER_02]: Violent video game laws, all this.

01:15:33.295 --> 01:15:37.019
[SPEAKER_02]: We have quite a bit of hypersensitivity going on.

01:15:40.642 --> 01:15:52.094
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really trying to get how... I mean, if you've got someone who, yeah, they've dropped the C-bomb three different times in one game and everyone's put out the warning on them, ban them.

01:15:53.075 --> 01:15:56.519
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's with their buddies and their buddies are doing it too, warn each of their buddies.

01:15:56.619 --> 01:15:57.960
[SPEAKER_02]: They get booted from the game for an hour.

01:15:58.020 --> 01:15:59.582
[SPEAKER_02]: They get a certain number of warns.

01:15:59.942 --> 01:16:00.663
[SPEAKER_02]: They're gone forever.

01:16:02.605 --> 01:16:03.566
[SPEAKER_02]: Give them a three strikes.

01:16:05.467 --> 01:16:07.410
[SPEAKER_06]: The DDR Freak System should be applied everywhere.

01:16:08.151 --> 01:16:09.432
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was wise.

01:16:09.452 --> 01:16:13.658
[SPEAKER_06]: The one part you missed, if you were good, you would start to lose points every month.

01:16:14.058 --> 01:16:14.278
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

01:16:15.119 --> 01:16:21.007
[SPEAKER_02]: But honestly, I actually did see that starting to really benefit.

01:16:21.207 --> 01:16:23.330
[SPEAKER_06]: And I never, ever got a point, ever.

01:16:23.954 --> 01:16:25.995
[SPEAKER_02]: I can fix that.

01:16:26.175 --> 01:16:27.916
[SPEAKER_02]: Not when they're dead.

01:16:28.216 --> 01:16:29.257
[SPEAKER_02]: Not when they're dead.

01:16:29.457 --> 01:16:39.942
[SPEAKER_02]: But my point is that if you've got someone who's having a really shitty day and they go off on someone, yeah, they should be held accountable for going off on somebody.

01:16:40.442 --> 01:16:41.483
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:16:56.187 --> 01:16:56.848
[SPEAKER_02]: Knock them out.

01:16:56.908 --> 01:16:59.510
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't even give a number of how many warnings you have.

01:16:59.550 --> 01:17:00.671
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't advertise that shit.

01:17:01.091 --> 01:17:03.033
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't advertise that your points will drop off.

01:17:03.794 --> 01:17:08.037
[SPEAKER_02]: Just say you get a certain amount of warning again, you're dropped.

01:17:09.178 --> 01:17:10.099
[SPEAKER_02]: It is up to us.

01:17:10.239 --> 01:17:11.260
[SPEAKER_02]: We can give you one strike.

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:12.461
[SPEAKER_02]: We can give you three strikes.

01:17:12.962 --> 01:17:14.243
[SPEAKER_02]: It depends on what we see.

01:17:15.194 --> 01:17:17.036
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well gosh, we get to keep talking about this.

01:17:17.196 --> 01:17:18.577
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had a lot of good discussions tonight.

01:17:18.617 --> 01:17:19.258
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up with this?

01:17:19.338 --> 01:17:20.820
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this supposed to be a slow news week?

01:17:21.801 --> 01:17:32.091
[SPEAKER_06]: Live.VogNetwork.com We could, again, keep this topic going forever, but we do want to end, you know, at some point tonight instead of tomorrow morning, so we're going to keep moving on in the interest of time.

01:17:32.471 --> 01:17:36.635
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they were right about Dancer X. Why don't we go to that next story, DarkSakura?

01:17:37.839 --> 01:17:40.121
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, my voice comes back.

01:17:41.542 --> 01:17:46.725
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure I've told this story before about my copy of Descent that I used to have that came on 14 discs.

01:17:47.866 --> 01:17:50.328
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, I sat and installed... That was the way to play.

01:17:51.633 --> 01:17:51.973
[SPEAKER_02]: Report it!

01:17:52.013 --> 01:17:52.213
[SPEAKER_02]: Report it!

01:18:14.602 --> 01:18:15.563
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

01:18:31.076 --> 01:18:46.045
[SPEAKER_02]: and the big thing about this is basically he's going sort of the path of Black Mesa where it's called Descent to UDK where it's not exactly a remake but it's going to bring in the original story with some embellishments.

01:18:46.105 --> 01:18:53.670
[SPEAKER_02]: He's basically trying to diversify the original gameplay and emphasize the scary bits and new weapons.

01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:54.471
[SPEAKER_02]: New weapons was good.

01:18:55.211 --> 01:18:59.954
[SPEAKER_02]: But man, Descent was the first game I played that gave me motion sickness.

01:19:02.048 --> 01:19:23.847
[SPEAKER_02]: and I sucked at it oh man but I loved it for people our age they all remember the first time playing a game like Descent it was like it's doom in 360 degrees it's so cool it was even more than that instead of having your little space shooters where you're on rails or going through different areas you had full freedom of movement it was amazing

01:19:24.868 --> 01:19:36.476
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I mean, yeah, there were more games, you know, there was when it went into Descent 3, but going back to the original and bringing in those factors that made the original great is, I think, a good idea.

01:19:36.837 --> 01:19:44.602
[SPEAKER_02]: There's, uh, Eurogamer actually has a, uh, um, trailer for it up on their website, and it looked pretty good.

01:19:46.563 --> 01:19:47.664
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked the music in Descent 2.

01:19:47.904 --> 01:19:48.445
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

01:19:49.386 --> 01:19:54.803
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's move on and travel around the world and check out some release dates and things that are coming through more official channels this week.

01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:56.921
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think there's something coming out this week.

01:19:57.241 --> 01:19:58.361
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure there's a game.

01:19:59.281 --> 01:19:59.922
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll get to it, though.

01:20:00.642 --> 01:20:01.262
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see.

01:20:01.442 --> 01:20:02.562
[SPEAKER_07]: What have we got this week?

01:20:02.963 --> 01:20:04.763
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the big game that's coming out?

01:20:04.803 --> 01:20:10.625
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's Freaky Forms Deluxe Creations Alive on 3DS.

01:20:10.925 --> 01:20:11.425
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that it?

01:20:11.605 --> 01:20:11.865
[SPEAKER_07]: No?

01:20:12.146 --> 01:20:12.426
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe?

01:20:13.806 --> 01:20:16.167
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's a game for a system that's not out for a couple weeks.

01:20:16.247 --> 01:20:19.328
[SPEAKER_07]: Mass Effect 3, the special edition for the Wii U.

01:20:21.328 --> 01:20:22.490
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I probably want to wait on that one.

01:20:22.510 --> 01:20:23.571
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, that's out this week?

01:20:24.452 --> 01:20:25.253
[SPEAKER_06]: How does that work?

01:20:27.175 --> 01:20:27.936
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

01:20:28.477 --> 01:20:29.959
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the dates need adjusting.

01:20:29.979 --> 01:20:30.259
[SPEAKER_06]: No, they're...

01:20:33.653 --> 01:20:36.074
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got in hand like Scribblenauts already.

01:20:37.815 --> 01:20:40.577
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that we can do anything with it.

01:20:40.637 --> 01:20:47.781
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's Nickelodeon Bubble Guppies on the DS or Nickelodeon Team Umizoomi and Dora's Fantastic Flight.

01:20:48.361 --> 01:20:51.963
[SPEAKER_07]: Both rated EC for those hardcore gamers out there on the DS.

01:20:53.223 --> 01:20:56.065
[SPEAKER_07]: or maybe Nickelodeon Dance 2 on the Wii and Xbox 360.

01:20:57.806 --> 01:20:57.986
[SPEAKER_07]: No?

01:20:58.646 --> 01:20:58.786
[SPEAKER_07]: No?

01:20:59.727 --> 01:21:04.129
[SPEAKER_07]: NASCAR The Game Inside Line on PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii.

01:21:04.650 --> 01:21:04.930
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe?

01:21:05.330 --> 01:21:05.450

[SPEAKER_06]: That is absolutely the game.

[SPEAKER_07]: That has everybody.

01:21:13.074 --> 01:21:13.514
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.

[SPEAKER_07]: Pop Tropica Adventures on the DS.

[SPEAKER_07]: Dragon Ball Z Budokai HD Collection on PS3 and Xbox 360.

01:21:41.925 --> 01:21:43.606
[SPEAKER_07]: Ragnarok Tactics on PSP.

[SPEAKER_07]: on PSP PSP not Vita PSP they just had a Ragnarok game on Vita already it came out last week Saints Row the third the full package on PS3 and Xbox 360 let's be honest so this really has the same content that was already on disc for the last game

[SPEAKER_07]: except for the three expansions but all the other DLC was on disc Big Time Rush Dance Party on the Wii

[SPEAKER_02]: You really like Tide.

01:22:52.258 --> 01:22:58.502
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to go to one of those midnight releases and pick up LittleBigPlanet Karting?

01:22:59.903 --> 01:23:01.884
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not even sure if I'm going to pick up LittleBigPlanet Karting.

01:23:01.984 --> 01:23:04.005
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to play it, but I haven't played LittleBigPlanet 2.

01:23:05.999 --> 01:23:07.060
[SPEAKER_07]: So, probably not.

01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:09.361
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I do like carding games.

01:23:09.881 --> 01:23:11.922
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be a little bit more motivated to play that.

01:23:12.422 --> 01:23:18.866
[SPEAKER_06]: All I'm going to say, I know you haven't seen Wreck-It Ralph yet, I'm not going to spoil it for you, but they need to make Sugar Rush a real game.

01:23:19.066 --> 01:23:20.186
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, they do.

01:23:20.867 --> 01:23:23.248
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that was fucking outstanding.

01:23:23.288 --> 01:23:24.889
[SPEAKER_02]: I would play the hell out of Sugar Rush.

01:23:24.949 --> 01:23:30.252
[SPEAKER_07]: Wreck-It Ralph is in the new Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing game, Transformed.

01:23:30.772 --> 01:23:32.813
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I hope there's a track or something.

01:23:32.833 --> 01:23:33.333
[SPEAKER_02]: Vanellope.

01:23:33.553 --> 01:23:34.834
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Vanellope von Schweetz.

01:23:35.569 --> 01:24:01.961
[SPEAKER_06]: which by the way there's actually a commercial for Sugar Rush oh yeah that was done as a sort of trailer for Wreck-It Ralph nice um talking about the arcade they're getting it in four quarters on your birthday I so want to say a quote from the ending and I can't say it because it's a spoiler but it's one of the like you got to know what I'm talking about I was laughing so hard it was the funniest thing in the movie like I'll tell you later off air I don't want to spoil it

01:24:02.541 --> 01:24:05.363
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's spoil some Japanese release dates.

01:24:05.643 --> 01:24:08.644
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you know that Japan is also getting Halo 4 this week?

01:24:08.784 --> 01:24:11.086
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're getting some new Xbox 360s to come along with it.

01:24:11.126 --> 01:24:14.087
[SPEAKER_06]: For all those Japanese Halo fans, there you go.

01:24:14.327 --> 01:24:16.408
[SPEAKER_06]: Both of you guys can get that this week.

01:24:17.509 --> 01:24:21.071
[SPEAKER_06]: Also coming out this week on the Xbox 360, Tropico 4 Gold Edition.

01:24:21.111 --> 01:24:23.212
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's just a price reduction of an existing game.

01:24:23.872 --> 01:24:26.033
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a re-release they're doing.

01:24:26.333 --> 01:24:27.414
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the game with the expansion.

01:24:28.893 --> 01:24:49.616
[SPEAKER_06]: on the Playstation 3 Silent Hill Downpour finally on the Playstation 3 in Japan this week Shin Sengoku Musou 6 Empires Hokuto Musou International getting a price reduction from Koei as well as a price reduction for Champion Jockey, G1 Jockey and Gallop Racer for those of you that like your horsey racing games in Japan

01:24:50.096 --> 01:24:52.837
[SPEAKER_07]: and the really embarrassing Move integration.

01:24:53.457 --> 01:24:54.757
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, is that the other big thing?

01:24:55.097 --> 01:24:59.279
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember the one that looks like you're playing Final Furlong?

01:24:59.379 --> 01:25:00.439
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Furlong, yeah.

01:25:00.619 --> 01:25:01.759
[SPEAKER_06]: That game was amazing.

01:25:01.859 --> 01:25:02.719
[SPEAKER_02]: Horse humping the game?

01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:03.880
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

01:25:04.140 --> 01:25:07.121
[SPEAKER_06]: Lastly, when do we get Wii U stuff in Japan?

01:25:07.141 --> 01:25:07.501
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's right.

01:25:07.541 --> 01:25:08.861
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't get it until December, huh?

01:25:10.021 --> 01:25:11.802
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't start reading those release dates until December.

01:25:13.263 --> 01:25:14.604
[SPEAKER_06]: How about the Nintendo 3DS?

01:25:15.665 --> 01:25:31.817
[SPEAKER_06]: Another 3DS LL, which is basically their XL pack It's a Dobutsu no Mori pack, limited edition Because Tobidase Dobutsu no Mori comes out this week on the Nintendo 3DS And what is Dobutsu no Mori?

01:25:32.057 --> 01:25:39.443
[SPEAKER_06]: Animal Forest, aka Animal Crossing That's right, Animal Crossing is the big release on the 3DS Technically that would be Animals Forest

01:25:40.163 --> 01:25:43.909
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if Animal Crossing isn't your thing, maybe you're more into Jewel Pet.

01:25:45.973 --> 01:25:51.416
[SPEAKER_06]: Mahou de Osare ni Dance Deco comes out this week as well on the 3DS.

01:25:51.996 --> 01:26:00.860
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fantastic that the 3DS isn't region-free like the DS was because, you know, people then can't import games that they like to play.

01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:04.442
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be very hard to play Animal Crossing anyway because it's all in Japanese.

01:26:04.522 --> 01:26:13.907
[SPEAKER_02]: I freaking tried on my Doubutsu no Mori for GameCube and even being... I read so slowly it takes an hour to do anything.

01:26:14.369 --> 01:26:27.492
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you guys know this, but when the little characters read when they're talking, in the Japanese version of the game, they were saying the little Japanese syllables really quick, so it sounded like they were actually talking.

01:26:27.872 --> 01:26:34.713
[SPEAKER_06]: But in the English version, you can't really do that same thing, so they would say the letters of the alphabet real fast.

01:26:34.893 --> 01:26:40.314
[SPEAKER_02]: And see, that's why I wanted the Japanese one to play, because I thought it would help me with my listening comprehension.

01:26:41.655 --> 01:26:41.875
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

01:26:42.315 --> 01:26:43.415
[SPEAKER_02]: It went way too fast.

01:26:44.286 --> 01:26:46.047
[SPEAKER_06]: How about the UK, DarkSakura?

01:26:46.868 --> 01:26:48.629
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a few selections for the UK.

01:26:48.889 --> 01:26:50.390
[SPEAKER_02]: On November 6th is Halo 4.

01:26:51.191 --> 01:26:55.014
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 7th is Curiosity for iPhone, PC, Android, and iPad.

01:26:56.735 --> 01:26:59.957
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope the cube contains eternal joy.

01:27:01.018 --> 01:27:03.260
[SPEAKER_02]: Karateka for Xbox 360.

01:27:05.514 --> 01:27:06.195
[SPEAKER_02]: When is the weekend?

01:27:06.215 --> 01:27:07.056
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you going to get the cube?

01:27:07.676 --> 01:27:08.677
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to know what's in the cube?

01:27:08.717 --> 01:27:10.319
[SPEAKER_06]: Curiosity, what's in the fucking cube?

01:27:10.479 --> 01:27:11.240
[SPEAKER_02]: What's in the box?

01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:12.921
[SPEAKER_06]: What's in the fucking box?

01:27:12.941 --> 01:27:13.862
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell me what's in the box!

01:27:13.922 --> 01:27:20.568
[SPEAKER_07]: I still have to update my iOS version, but I would like to pirate it just for the principle of the thing.

01:27:21.445 --> 01:27:23.867
[SPEAKER_02]: On November 8th, we have Angry Birds Star Wars.

01:27:25.628 --> 01:27:33.094
[SPEAKER_02]: On the 9th, Little Big Planet Karting and Mass Effect Trilogy, which I'm going to make my husband get me.

01:27:34.635 --> 01:27:35.236
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it.

01:27:36.492 --> 01:27:41.036
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you did realize that LittleBigPlanet Karting is not coming on the Vita at launch.

01:27:42.337 --> 01:27:46.100
[SPEAKER_06]: But if I buy it on the PS3, I'll still get my free Vita, right?

01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:47.381
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that part of the deal?

01:27:47.662 --> 01:27:49.143
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't seen the sticker on the box.

01:27:49.843 --> 01:27:54.848
[SPEAKER_07]: I know it's on the box for the PlayStation All-Stars stuff, but at the same time, I don't really want that game.

01:27:55.308 --> 01:27:56.650
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not even going to sell that for me.

01:27:56.830 --> 01:27:57.050
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

01:27:57.369 --> 01:28:00.411
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, you know what I totally love about playing Mass Effect on the PC?

01:28:00.551 --> 01:28:00.771
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

01:28:01.451 --> 01:28:04.493
[SPEAKER_02]: Is hacking the coalesced INI file to get other outfits.

01:28:04.673 --> 01:28:06.734
[SPEAKER_06]: And you wonder why you can't get online in part three.

01:28:06.814 --> 01:28:11.456
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I reinstalled the fucker and it wasn't working.

01:28:11.636 --> 01:28:12.977
[SPEAKER_02]: So bite my booty.

01:28:13.397 --> 01:28:13.897
[SPEAKER_06]: Reported.

01:28:16.899 --> 01:28:19.282
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys.

01:28:19.622 --> 01:28:21.644
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the classic game of the week.

01:28:21.964 --> 01:28:23.085
[SPEAKER_06]: Back when games worked.

01:28:23.986 --> 01:28:24.386
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

01:28:25.628 --> 01:28:31.153
[SPEAKER_07]: So yes, there's a patent firm, and I don't even know why these things exist, but whatever.

01:28:31.993 --> 01:28:38.580
[SPEAKER_07]: A Texas company has filed a lawsuit against Wizards of the Coast.

01:28:38.700 --> 01:28:43.524
[SPEAKER_07]: Or not against Wizards of the Coast, I guess Hasbro, who has the Magic of the Gathering online game.

01:28:43.564 --> 01:28:47.468
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't even realize Hasbro does online games, but okay, I guess I got into video gaming.

01:28:48.089 --> 01:28:50.331
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyways, so Magic of the Gathering online, um...

01:28:52.132 --> 01:28:54.813
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been out there for a while now, 10 years.

01:28:55.493 --> 01:29:04.036
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess this wildcat, Intellectual Property Holdings of Dallas, they're filing a lawsuit against them to get it taken offline.

01:29:04.496 --> 01:29:11.898
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess they hold the patent for Unit Commander, which calls, I guess, the ultimate mercenary trading card game.

01:29:12.698 --> 01:29:14.639
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're saying that it infringes on that.

01:29:15.936 --> 01:29:26.400
[SPEAKER_07]: Which something tells me that they probably had Magic the Gathering out there for a lot longer than they've had the patent for Unit Commander.

01:29:27.781 --> 01:29:32.383
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I might add is about as generic as their patent for said game.

01:29:34.648 --> 01:29:34.988
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

01:29:35.248 --> 01:29:35.689
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

01:29:37.870 --> 01:29:40.392
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see if they even... I don't think anything's really going to happen.

01:29:40.492 --> 01:29:43.694
[SPEAKER_06]: Pat and Troll, what are you going to do?

01:29:44.055 --> 01:29:47.517
[SPEAKER_06]: It really does astound me that Magic the Gathering is still going after all this time.

01:29:47.597 --> 01:29:48.578
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty strong, you know?

01:29:48.858 --> 01:29:50.880
[SPEAKER_06]: There was just a tournament here locally over the weekend.

01:29:50.900 --> 01:29:51.400
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you know that?

01:29:52.401 --> 01:29:53.041
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't doubt it.

01:29:53.181 --> 01:29:55.643
[SPEAKER_06]: People still play this like mad.

01:29:55.703 --> 01:29:57.064
[SPEAKER_06]: And I still suck at it.

01:29:59.172 --> 01:30:00.373
[SPEAKER_06]: Dragon Quest VII is being remade for the 3DS

01:30:16.900 --> 01:30:18.061
[SPEAKER_06]: Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra

01:30:42.522 --> 01:30:56.914
[SPEAKER_06]: that's rad very nice I really hope that comes out over here we'll see Dragon Quest 7 if you weren't aware it was originally released on the PlayStation 1 that was about 12 years ago it was released in the USA Dragon Warrior 7 yes it was

01:30:58.115 --> 01:31:01.439
[SPEAKER_06]: Didn't they finally go back to calling it Dragon Quest in the US with 8 though?

01:31:01.539 --> 01:31:02.020
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought they did.

01:31:03.161 --> 01:31:05.624
[SPEAKER_06]: Man, that's a PS2 game we need to go back and really beat.

01:31:05.644 --> 01:31:06.345
[SPEAKER_06]: Dragon Quest 8 was so good.

01:31:06.385 --> 01:31:09.649
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when the demo for that was like a big thing.

01:31:10.871 --> 01:31:15.116
[SPEAKER_06]: So no word yet if that is coming here, but one can hope.

01:31:16.943 --> 01:31:17.263
[SPEAKER_06]: Dragon Quest VII

01:31:38.734 --> 01:31:42.920
[SPEAKER_06]: Bratz, play this game and then report me for calling you a brat.

01:31:43.962 --> 01:31:45.164
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the classic game of the week.

01:31:45.204 --> 01:31:46.806
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?

01:31:46.826 --> 01:31:47.587
[SPEAKER_02]: Spank your ass.

01:31:48.869 --> 01:31:49.610
[SPEAKER_02]: It's GigaWink 2.

01:31:51.073 --> 01:31:53.637
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm actually specifically referring to the Dreamcast version.

01:31:54.212 --> 01:31:54.652
[SPEAKER_02]: Radiant Silvergun

01:32:14.551 --> 01:32:14.951
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that?

01:32:15.792 --> 01:32:22.858
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, the game was originally developed by Takumi and it came out on the Naomi arcade system.

01:32:23.358 --> 01:32:25.500
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in 2001 it came out on the Dreamcast.

01:32:27.201 --> 01:32:30.403
[SPEAKER_02]: It basically has like uber huge scores.

01:32:30.463 --> 01:32:32.845
[SPEAKER_02]: It seriously is like the ego pumping score system.

01:32:33.206 --> 01:32:34.747
[SPEAKER_02]: You can actually score in the quintillions.

01:32:34.987 --> 01:32:35.487
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you know that?

01:32:37.269 --> 01:32:48.785
[SPEAKER_02]: On top of that, the good thing about it being a horizontal monitor is that taking it from arcade to the home version meant that you pretty much still got the arcade treatment.

01:32:49.185 --> 01:32:53.952
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't have to worry about rotating your TV or anything on edge or any of that.

01:32:54.632 --> 01:32:55.393
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura

01:33:10.371 --> 01:33:14.113
[SPEAKER_02]: So you had a ton of different fighters.

01:33:15.013 --> 01:33:17.695
[SPEAKER_02]: A good half of them actually were unlocked.

01:33:18.235 --> 01:33:22.837
[SPEAKER_02]: You could have Kingfisher, Sparrow, Raven, Stork, and Albatross.

01:33:23.157 --> 01:33:35.063
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you could have the Raijin, Purchka, Stranger, Carmine, and Wilderstand, which were from the first Giggling.

01:33:36.451 --> 01:33:45.035
[SPEAKER_02]: The soundtrack was super awesome, and I even remembered when you could get the soundtrack, it came with the soundtrack for Mars Matrix, which is another game I probably should do.

01:33:46.296 --> 01:33:47.797
[SPEAKER_02]: But the music is all orchestral.

01:33:47.817 --> 01:33:49.578
[SPEAKER_02]: It should turn up a little bit if you want.

01:33:54.781 --> 01:33:56.162
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a really great soundtrack.

01:33:56.182 --> 01:33:59.683
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really, in the end, it's a shooter, yeah.

01:34:00.603 --> 01:34:07.445
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's definitely one that people should check out, especially since the Dreamcast is still kind of around and kicking.

01:34:08.286 --> 01:34:09.066
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's pretty.

01:34:09.866 --> 01:34:19.570
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing about that, too, is that it's basically around... The gameplay itself is around the absorption and reflection type mechanics.

01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:22.671
[SPEAKER_02]: It's huge boss fights, tons of enemies.

01:34:23.451 --> 01:34:27.132
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, I wouldn't quite say it's a bullet hell as much as it is an enemy hell.

01:34:28.152 --> 01:34:31.053
[SPEAKER_02]: But I love the level scrolling and the design.

01:34:31.193 --> 01:34:37.755
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it adds another layer of depth even if it is a top-down type shooter.

01:34:38.535 --> 01:34:40.796
[SPEAKER_02]: So, definitely worth playing.

01:34:41.876 --> 01:34:45.597
[SPEAKER_06]: Alrighty, some Dreamcast love from DarkSakura this week in the Classic Game of the Week.

01:34:45.637 --> 01:34:46.497
[SPEAKER_06]: It is Giga Wing 2.

01:34:47.418 --> 01:34:47.618
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep.

01:34:47.898 --> 01:34:48.958
[SPEAKER_06]: Worth the Dreamcast.

01:34:50.518 --> 01:34:51.339
[SPEAKER_06]: Very nice pick.

01:34:52.861 --> 01:34:53.281
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

01:34:53.702 --> 01:34:59.248
[SPEAKER_06]: YYR in the chat room says, GigaWing2 is also the only shmup I know of that supports four simultaneous players.

01:34:59.948 --> 01:35:00.369
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

01:35:01.505 --> 01:35:01.825
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:35:02.705 --> 01:35:04.926
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that is going to do it for Part A of our show.

01:35:04.946 --> 01:35:05.546
[SPEAKER_06]: But don't go anywhere.

01:35:05.586 --> 01:35:12.507
[SPEAKER_06]: There is plenty more Orange Launch Radio to come tonight, including the Fugle Question of the Week, some details on the Wii U's browser.

01:35:12.567 --> 01:35:15.228
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be very interesting, as well as some other Nintendo details.

01:35:15.968 --> 01:35:18.649
[SPEAKER_06]: And Mega Man Wily Wars.

01:35:18.969 --> 01:35:21.729
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't know about this game, it may have fallen off your radar.

01:35:21.749 --> 01:35:22.449
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a new game.

01:35:22.469 --> 01:35:23.510
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a game from many, many years ago.

01:35:23.530 --> 01:35:24.430
[SPEAKER_06]: It was for the Genesis.

01:35:24.910 --> 01:35:26.370
[SPEAKER_06]: It never came out in the U.S.

01:35:27.190 --> 01:35:28.270
[SPEAKER_06]: until now.

01:35:28.671 --> 01:35:30.511
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll be talking about that after the break.

01:35:36.798 --> 01:35:45.945
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live at the Voice of Geeks Network, VOGnetwork.com with the 480th episode of our show.

01:35:47.146 --> 01:35:52.631
[SPEAKER_06]: Possibly a different time for some of you tonight because there was that whole daylight savings that happened over the weekend.

01:35:53.051 --> 01:35:55.573
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what they say, spring forward, fall back.

01:35:55.633 --> 01:35:58.015
[SPEAKER_06]: So everybody got an extra hour of sleep last night.

01:35:58.635 --> 01:35:59.156
[SPEAKER_02]: I needed it.

01:35:59.476 --> 01:36:03.419
[SPEAKER_06]: Or if you were me, you got home at 4 in the morning instead of 5 in the morning.

01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:10.266
[SPEAKER_06]: That was my lucky thing, but that's what I get for going to the Bay Area and staying out late and then driving home the same night.

01:36:10.346 --> 01:36:10.667
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

01:36:11.107 --> 01:36:14.871
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I had Starbucks and I wasn't feeling tired.

01:36:15.672 --> 01:36:19.356
[SPEAKER_06]: Hooray, by the way, for Peppermint Mochas being back at Starbucks.

01:36:19.616 --> 01:36:21.418
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess technically you can get those any time of the year.

01:36:21.598 --> 01:36:22.639
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also get them sugar-free.

01:36:22.918 --> 01:36:40.118
[SPEAKER_06]: but yeah they have the skinny ones now which is great but you know what they don't have yet is the gingerbread lattes and those are amazing anyway it's not a coffee cast it's a video game cast it's just you know coffee is sometimes how we get through the day we will get back to video games Rob coffee is how I get through my life

01:36:41.159 --> 01:36:44.162
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want to mention the elections are this week, you might have heard.

01:36:44.262 --> 01:36:46.324
[SPEAKER_06]: So, of course, if you live in the U.S.

01:36:46.524 --> 01:36:50.047
[SPEAKER_06]: or, you know, a country that lets you vote, you probably should vote.

01:36:50.868 --> 01:36:52.530
[SPEAKER_06]: It is your right after all.

01:36:52.870 --> 01:36:56.513
[SPEAKER_06]: And remember, you do not get to bitch about the results if you do not vote.

01:36:56.813 --> 01:37:02.038
[SPEAKER_06]: And I, for one, can't wait for those frickin' election calls to stop calling me on my phone every ten minutes.

01:37:02.378 --> 01:37:06.142
[SPEAKER_02]: I did, however, get to call Dan Lundgren a dick.

01:37:06.702 --> 01:37:07.303
[SPEAKER_02]: Or he would hear it.

01:37:08.476 --> 01:37:09.156
[SPEAKER_06]: Smart Glass Member

01:37:29.745 --> 01:37:33.146
[SPEAKER_07]: We knew that Forza Horizon was going to use smart glass, but it kind of wasn't.

01:37:33.327 --> 01:37:34.767
[SPEAKER_07]: So now it is.

01:37:35.127 --> 01:37:42.670
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they've got some really cool stuff with that, including an in-game map that you can use, which is kind of cool.

01:37:42.930 --> 01:37:48.753
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess it allows you to do all the same stuff that you can do by pausing the game, but now without pausing the game.

01:37:48.793 --> 01:37:51.474
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can set destination GPSs and all that stuff.

01:37:53.479 --> 01:37:54.241
[SPEAKER_07]: Might be kind of cool.

01:37:54.501 --> 01:37:55.785
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd have to check that out, I guess.

01:37:56.427 --> 01:37:58.112
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Forza looks like it might be fun.

01:37:58.573 --> 01:37:59.977
[SPEAKER_07]: Have to ask Bobby if he's tried it yet.

01:38:00.625 --> 01:38:02.746
[SPEAKER_06]: He did a review at vognetwork.com.

01:38:02.806 --> 01:38:03.686
[SPEAKER_06]: He would tell you to go read.

01:38:04.006 --> 01:38:06.026
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I understand that, but I meant about the smart glass thing.

01:38:06.126 --> 01:38:06.926
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the smart glass.

01:38:07.046 --> 01:38:07.827
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I don't know about that.

01:38:09.447 --> 01:38:11.667
[SPEAKER_06]: He's busy with the football stuff.

01:38:13.148 --> 01:38:14.408
[SPEAKER_06]: I played the demo for Forza.

01:38:14.488 --> 01:38:18.549
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't do the smart glass thing because I don't think that's in the demo, but I like the demo.

01:38:19.269 --> 01:38:20.429
[SPEAKER_06]: I might pick up the game.

01:38:20.729 --> 01:38:21.070
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

01:38:21.130 --> 01:38:23.150
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like there's just so much right now that...

01:38:23.490 --> 01:38:25.891
[SPEAKER_07]: I have that racing wheel, man, that's been collecting dust.

01:38:26.191 --> 01:38:30.211
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of need to use that, so I may have to pick it up to try that.

01:38:31.572 --> 01:38:33.112
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.

01:38:33.292 --> 01:38:35.953
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, something that's kind of cool, that Shootmania Storm.

01:38:36.033 --> 01:38:40.714
[SPEAKER_07]: I was kind of a fan of Trackmania, and so now they're getting into the other type of games.

01:38:41.274 --> 01:38:45.555
[SPEAKER_07]: Shootmania being their kind of first-person shooter arena battle game.

01:38:45.995 --> 01:38:52.556
[SPEAKER_07]: Although, I mean, one of the things about the whole Mania series is that you can customize everything, including the game types and all that.

01:38:52.916 --> 01:39:20.159
[SPEAKER_07]: and share those so it is going to be I guess coming soon in a beta form and that'll be out in December and then the game is expected to arrive on January 23rd which is going to be kind of cool and I guess the beta is going to also have like you know welcome build they're going to have a couple new game modes and stuff like one they mentioned is laser jump and wall jump and grappling hook and

01:39:21.019 --> 01:39:25.141
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't help but think, but looking at this stuff, it'd be kind of cool as like a 3D laser tag game.

01:39:25.661 --> 01:39:26.982
[SPEAKER_07]: That might be pretty awesome.

01:39:27.802 --> 01:39:28.843
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you and laser tag.

01:39:29.123 --> 01:39:30.043
[SPEAKER_06]: Fucking love laser tag.

01:39:30.063 --> 01:39:31.564
[SPEAKER_06]: When was the last time you went to like a QZAR?

01:39:31.964 --> 01:39:32.624
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a while.

01:39:32.985 --> 01:39:33.445
[SPEAKER_06]: That's too bad.

01:39:33.625 --> 01:39:35.066
[SPEAKER_06]: I miss the QZARs.

01:39:35.866 --> 01:39:38.267
[SPEAKER_06]: They still have that one in Vacaville, which is like the closest one, sadly.

01:39:39.116 --> 01:39:43.820
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think they do, but it's just kind of... It's a sad shadow of its former self.

01:39:43.860 --> 01:39:44.380
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:49.123
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the next closest one's in Concord, or Pleasanton.

01:39:50.785 --> 01:39:51.085
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

01:39:52.489 --> 01:39:53.150
[SPEAKER_06]: VACAVILLE NUT TREE

01:40:16.894 --> 01:40:17.955
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:40:36.553 --> 01:40:37.073
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

01:40:52.960 --> 01:41:16.572
[SPEAKER_07]: and the it was six six cents was the um company that made the original stuff it's uh 20 new test chambers that you can play and i guess they have new cubes that you can you know adjust the size of and you can also move portals around stuff and rotate objects using the move controller that might be fun i have portal too and i do have a move that i'm not using so maybe maybe

01:41:18.544 --> 01:41:19.045
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:41:37.784 --> 01:41:47.438
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, a lot of people are waiting for the PlayStation debut of the original Mass Effect, which of course will be in the trilogy, or you'll also be able to get it on the PlayStation Network.

01:41:47.659 --> 01:41:48.360
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to set you back $15.

01:41:48.620 --> 01:41:51.364
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also... Excuse me.

01:41:53.107 --> 01:41:53.648
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sneezing.

01:41:53.708 --> 01:41:54.649
[SPEAKER_06]: Radio guy's worst enemy.

01:41:55.991 --> 01:41:59.374
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also some detail on the DLC that's going to be included with the trilogy.

01:42:00.175 --> 01:42:02.578
[SPEAKER_06]: All the Cerberus Network with Mass Effect 2, of course.

01:42:03.259 --> 01:42:09.126
[SPEAKER_06]: On the PlayStation 3, though, you're going to get Lair of the Shadow Broker, Kasumi, which is what you need most of all.

01:42:10.407 --> 01:42:11.048
[SPEAKER_06]: And Overlord.

01:42:11.728 --> 01:42:12.428
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you get Zaid?

01:42:12.728 --> 01:42:14.669
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't say Zaid, and it doesn't say Arrival.

01:42:15.429 --> 01:42:16.989
[SPEAKER_06]: So you don't get all of the PlayStation 3.

01:42:17.049 --> 01:42:20.230
[SPEAKER_02]: Arrival was really necessary to the story, I think.

01:42:20.250 --> 01:42:22.470
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if they can get another ten bucks out of you, though.

01:42:22.790 --> 01:42:25.751
[SPEAKER_06]: Mass Effect 3 will have Cerberus Network, but not Leviathan.

01:42:26.511 --> 01:42:31.692
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm assuming it will have the multiplayer and all that good stuff, so that's one of the best features that keeps it going.

01:42:32.212 --> 01:42:32.792
[SPEAKER_06]: So there you go.

01:42:33.452 --> 01:42:34.772
[SPEAKER_06]: December 4th on the PlayStation 3.

01:42:35.272 --> 01:42:37.453
[SPEAKER_06]: And I kind of want it.

01:42:38.713 --> 01:42:41.435
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because I have the entire trilogy on 360.

01:42:41.795 --> 01:42:43.296
[SPEAKER_06]: I have the entire trilogy on PC.

01:42:43.396 --> 01:42:48.300
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I kind of owe it to myself to get the entire trilogy on PlayStation as well.

01:42:48.340 --> 01:42:49.280
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you agree, Loki?

01:42:49.620 --> 01:42:50.581
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you get my logic?

01:42:50.721 --> 01:42:51.562
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't you understand me?

01:42:51.802 --> 01:42:51.942
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope.

01:42:55.287 --> 01:42:57.448
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a Wreck-It Ralph iOS game.

01:42:57.509 --> 01:43:00.510
[SPEAKER_06]: If you were a fan of the movie, maybe you'll be a fan of the iOS game.

01:43:00.691 --> 01:43:04.993
[SPEAKER_06]: It includes Fix-It Felix Jr., which is the game that the movie's about.

01:43:05.294 --> 01:43:07.075
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want to point out, though, Fix-It Felix Jr.

01:43:07.095 --> 01:43:09.096
[SPEAKER_06]: is also a standalone app for free.

01:43:09.797 --> 01:43:13.619
[SPEAKER_06]: This other app is 99 cents, and you can also get Sweet Climber.

01:43:14.820 --> 01:43:17.462
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just inspired by Sugar Rush, but it's not a racing game.

01:43:17.522 --> 01:43:19.083
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a bounce-up-the-game.

01:43:19.763 --> 01:43:20.204
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless...

01:43:41.913 --> 01:43:44.315
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it has arcade support because it's a twin stick shooter.

01:43:45.716 --> 01:43:49.258
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also, I'll tell you, I downloaded it because it's only 99 cents.

01:43:49.278 --> 01:43:49.659
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell?

01:43:49.679 --> 01:43:50.339
[SPEAKER_06]: And I love the movie.

01:43:51.060 --> 01:43:56.123
[SPEAKER_06]: There is also apparently Turbo Time is a game that's coming, but it's locked right now.

01:43:56.163 --> 01:43:57.124
[SPEAKER_06]: It says coming soon.

01:43:57.244 --> 01:43:59.946
[SPEAKER_06]: So there will be, it looks like a fourth game added into it.

01:44:00.806 --> 01:44:03.848
[SPEAKER_06]: Pretty cool if you're a fan of Wreck-It Ralph, the iOS games out there right now.

01:44:05.008 --> 01:44:10.571
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a wedding in gaming this week, and this is a pretty good one for the gaming industry.

01:44:11.371 --> 01:44:15.493
[SPEAKER_06]: John Romero and Brenda Brathwaite actually got married.

01:44:15.533 --> 01:44:18.755
[SPEAKER_06]: This is actually last weekend, but just the news came out this week.

01:44:19.575 --> 01:44:20.076
[SPEAKER_06]: Get this.

01:44:20.776 --> 01:44:27.399
[SPEAKER_06]: Between the two of them, Doom, Wizardry, Quake, Commander Keen, Jagged Alliance, Wolfenstein 3D.

01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:35.563
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe this is why, wasn't she one of the two people behind that Kickstarter for the old school RPG or something like that?

01:44:36.223 --> 01:44:37.544
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember.

01:44:38.064 --> 01:44:40.785
[SPEAKER_07]: I think she was, and maybe that's why they closed down.

01:44:40.825 --> 01:44:42.486
[SPEAKER_06]: Her name came up on the show recently.

01:44:42.626 --> 01:44:46.627
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, maybe that's why they closed down the whole Kickstarter for that.

01:44:46.728 --> 01:44:51.850
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they also established a social game studio together in 2010.

01:44:51.990 --> 01:44:54.871
[SPEAKER_06]: Loot Drop was the studio that they co-founded together.

01:44:55.852 --> 01:45:01.515
[SPEAKER_06]: They were married by id Software co-founder Tom Hall, which is pretty cute.

01:45:02.556 --> 01:45:04.938
[SPEAKER_06]: And get this, DarkSakura, guess where they were married?

01:45:06.439 --> 01:45:07.760
[SPEAKER_06]: Disneyland on the steamboat.

01:45:11.562 --> 01:45:15.625
[SPEAKER_06]: And then for their honeymoon, they went to hell and killed demons.

01:45:15.945 --> 01:45:16.386
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kidding.

01:45:16.406 --> 01:45:16.946
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was fun.

01:45:17.166 --> 01:45:17.767
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was fun.

01:45:18.547 --> 01:45:19.528
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's move on.

01:45:20.048 --> 01:45:20.929
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, what do you have for us?

01:45:21.334 --> 01:45:22.255
[SPEAKER_02]: Some stuff.

01:45:23.115 --> 01:45:23.656
[SPEAKER_02]: Things.

01:45:24.196 --> 01:45:26.738
[SPEAKER_02]: How about some Ragnarok stuff?

01:45:27.698 --> 01:45:32.301
[SPEAKER_02]: The developer for Ragnarok is working, and that's... God, I hate when my screen messes up like this.

01:45:32.842 --> 01:45:39.206
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Kazuki Morishita, I believe, is working on a Nintendo 3DS title.

01:45:39.806 --> 01:45:43.929
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not saying what it's going to be, but he works on Ragnarok, so hey.

01:45:45.009 --> 01:45:45.850
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's more Ragnarok.

01:45:47.285 --> 01:45:54.032
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, in more news, Treasure is working on a Nintendo 3DS exclusive.

01:45:54.852 --> 01:45:57.735
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know if Treasure's behind it, it's going to be fucking weird.

01:45:58.616 --> 01:45:59.116
[SPEAKER_02]: And pretty good.

01:46:00.277 --> 01:46:00.738
[SPEAKER_02]: Weird and good.

01:46:00.758 --> 01:46:01.499
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they did Gunstar Heroes.

01:46:01.519 --> 01:46:02.520
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking weird, but pretty good.

01:46:02.800 --> 01:46:02.980
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:06.023
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think Treasure's ever put out any crap, so...

01:46:09.156 --> 01:46:20.047
[SPEAKER_02]: And then... Cypress Hills Shag loses $250 million at the Grand Theft Auto lawsuit.

01:46:21.108 --> 01:46:21.648
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically...

01:46:23.792 --> 01:46:31.015
[SPEAKER_02]: He said that his likeness and life story was used to create the character CJ in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

01:46:32.255 --> 01:46:34.176
[SPEAKER_02]: And the judge said, no.

01:46:35.076 --> 01:46:35.916
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, you lose.

01:46:36.497 --> 01:46:37.217
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not pass, go.

01:46:37.677 --> 01:46:38.897
[SPEAKER_02]: Lose $250 million.

01:46:39.077 --> 01:46:41.418
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think he lost $250 million.

01:46:41.438 --> 01:46:42.499
[SPEAKER_06]: He lost the ability to win.

01:46:42.519 --> 01:46:46.520
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't win $250 million, but you can't lose what you didn't get.

01:46:46.540 --> 01:46:47.320
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not pass, go.

01:46:47.340 --> 01:46:48.081
[SPEAKER_02]: Do not collect $250 million.

01:46:48.361 --> 01:46:49.921
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that and he had to pay for his court costs.

01:46:50.421 --> 01:46:51.222
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's probably out something.

01:46:51.442 --> 01:46:52.082
[SPEAKER_06]: He's out something.

01:46:53.519 --> 01:46:54.180
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know what I say?

01:46:55.823 --> 01:46:58.488
[SPEAKER_06]: That whole lawsuit was insane in the membrane.

01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:00.531
[SPEAKER_06]: Womp womp.

01:47:01.413 --> 01:47:02.194
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's it.

01:47:02.374 --> 01:47:02.775
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's it?

01:47:02.815 --> 01:47:03.036
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

01:47:03.416 --> 01:47:05.740
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to the Fugle Question of the Week.

01:47:14.082 --> 01:47:18.664
[SPEAKER_06]: Take the words Facebook and Google as in plus and slam them together and you get Fugle.

01:47:18.704 --> 01:47:20.084
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's where this segment comes from.

01:47:20.144 --> 01:47:23.906
[SPEAKER_06]: It's where we ask our fan communities a question and get their answers.

01:47:24.566 --> 01:47:29.208
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, since everybody's talking about the movies, we had to make the Fugle question about Wreck-It Ralph.

01:47:29.688 --> 01:47:34.050
[SPEAKER_06]: If the box office numbers are any indication, it looks like many of you saw Wreck-It Ralph this weekend.

01:47:34.070 --> 01:47:35.030
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you think of the movie?

01:47:35.511 --> 01:47:38.592
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it a great thing for video games or were you not happy with the way things were done?

01:47:39.472 --> 01:47:42.013
[SPEAKER_06]: Actdeft starts us off on Google Plus saying, I loved it.

01:47:42.113 --> 01:47:43.214
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything about it was great.

01:47:43.574 --> 01:47:45.555
[SPEAKER_06]: The story, the cameos, the jokes, everything.

01:47:45.695 --> 01:47:47.356
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone who hasn't seen this movie should do so.

01:47:47.456 --> 01:47:47.916
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great.

01:47:47.976 --> 01:47:49.717
[SPEAKER_06]: It truly surpasses the Disney standards.

01:47:50.277 --> 01:47:51.777
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it a great thing for video games?

01:47:52.098 --> 01:47:59.961
[SPEAKER_06]: That I really do not know since the movie only has references to games and such, but it isn't a real video game movie like Silent Hill, for example.

01:48:00.421 --> 01:48:02.822
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a story set in a video game universe.

01:48:03.203 --> 01:48:08.085
[SPEAKER_06]: But maybe it'll get people interested in retro gaming since most of the references are really from the old days of gaming.

01:48:09.486 --> 01:48:13.349
[SPEAKER_06]: Elliot B answers the question on Google and says, I was really excited about seeing it.

01:48:13.389 --> 01:48:14.330
[SPEAKER_06]: The trailer looked great.

01:48:14.871 --> 01:48:18.834
[SPEAKER_06]: Then I realized it's not out until February here in the UK.

01:48:18.914 --> 01:48:21.537
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's something that I want to just pose a question.

01:48:21.657 --> 01:48:24.640
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think there are kids growing up nowadays that don't know what an arcade is?

01:48:26.502 --> 01:48:42.987
[SPEAKER_06]: you know one thing I will fault the movie for is that it was a little you did have to suspend disbelief that people were lining up at the arcade to get in when they'd open it in the morning and that it was as full as it looked because you and I and she all know that arcades don't look like that anymore unfortunately unless there's a water park attached

01:48:43.539 --> 01:48:44.119
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right.

01:48:44.660 --> 01:48:48.682
[SPEAKER_06]: So that you did have to suspend disbelief for a little bit.

01:48:48.762 --> 01:48:51.303
[SPEAKER_06]: But are there kids growing up today that don't know what an arcade is?

01:48:52.084 --> 01:48:56.046
[SPEAKER_06]: No, because kids still have birthday parties at Chuck E. Cheese and Dave and Buster, well, or whatever.

01:48:56.586 --> 01:48:57.587
[SPEAKER_06]: All those types of places.

01:48:58.247 --> 01:49:00.328
[SPEAKER_06]: Bounce houses have arcades in them.

01:49:00.468 --> 01:49:01.489
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all ticket redemption.

01:49:02.029 --> 01:49:06.851
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a few arcade games in there, but most of it's Ticket Redemption.

01:49:06.931 --> 01:49:08.172
[SPEAKER_06]: Disneyland still has arcades.

01:49:09.092 --> 01:49:21.258
[SPEAKER_06]: There's arcades around, but it's just a lot of them tend to be the dollar experiences and they're driving games or gun games or whatever.

01:49:21.338 --> 01:49:24.639
[SPEAKER_06]: Just very few of the Fix-It Felix Jr.

01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:28.481
[SPEAKER_06]: type of games, which clearly was inspired by Donkey Kong and that type of stuff.

01:49:28.581 --> 01:49:29.862
[SPEAKER_06]: That type of experience...

01:49:30.402 --> 01:49:35.663
[SPEAKER_06]: doesn't really exist anymore except maybe in the corner to get little use out of those old games.

01:49:37.944 --> 01:49:40.424
[SPEAKER_06]: So Elliot wants to know he went and saw Skyfall instead.

01:49:41.044 --> 01:49:44.725
[SPEAKER_06]: Now see, Skyfall is not here until this week and I really want to see it.

01:49:46.226 --> 01:49:47.746
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan's been pissing himself over it.

01:49:47.826 --> 01:49:51.567
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually really like James Bond movies so I'm kind of excited about Skyfall.

01:49:51.607 --> 01:49:52.587
[SPEAKER_02]: And Craig is pretty...

01:49:53.286 --> 01:49:54.026
[SPEAKER_06]: He's a great Bond.

01:49:54.166 --> 01:49:54.626
[SPEAKER_02]: He's great.

01:49:54.846 --> 01:49:55.646
[SPEAKER_02]: I love his eyes.

01:49:56.587 --> 01:49:58.127
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll be even better as Indiana Jones.

01:49:59.987 --> 01:50:02.068
[SPEAKER_06]: Next up, E3VL.

01:50:02.428 --> 01:50:04.808
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm guessing that's Evel on Google+.

01:50:04.988 --> 01:50:09.409
[SPEAKER_06]: Loved the video game nostalgia, especially those happening in the background and emotional spikes.

01:50:09.909 --> 01:50:12.089
[SPEAKER_06]: This film was like the Roger Rabbit of video games.

01:50:12.509 --> 01:50:18.170
[SPEAKER_06]: Seems like the movie panders way too much to the old gen gamers, 20 plus years old, with the video game references.

01:50:18.550 --> 01:50:22.271
[SPEAKER_06]: Younger audiences may feel bored if it weren't for the sugar rush game and level puns.

01:50:22.991 --> 01:50:30.356
[SPEAKER_06]: If you bring your kids, prepare for them to be confused and saddened in certain segments and jump for joy after wiped tears as its problems are resolved.

01:50:31.116 --> 01:50:37.140
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, without spoiling too much though, the sugar rush thing kind of made up the majority of the movie.

01:50:37.300 --> 01:50:42.504
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't think kids, I don't think the references would be, I mean there's a lot of references that are going to go over the kids' heads.

01:50:42.864 --> 01:50:47.767
[SPEAKER_06]: Like in the baddie video game, which is in the trailer, I'm not spoiling anything.

01:50:48.027 --> 01:51:01.900
[SPEAKER_06]: The Little League of Villains Batty Recovery Group Like, kids will just get that they're villains They'll get Zunkief They'll get Bison Maybe But they're not I think they'll get Pac-Man as well Why did

01:51:03.121 --> 01:51:08.227
[SPEAKER_06]: Why did... There's a very obvious reference to Kano from Mortal Kombat.

01:51:08.348 --> 01:51:09.149
[SPEAKER_02]: That is Kano.

01:51:09.209 --> 01:51:09.569
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

01:51:09.609 --> 01:51:10.951
[SPEAKER_06]: A very, very obvious reference.

01:51:11.271 --> 01:51:12.673
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think kids are going to get it.

01:51:12.753 --> 01:51:14.375
[SPEAKER_02]: The zombie is from House of the Dead.

01:51:14.415 --> 01:51:15.737
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but adults get it.

01:51:15.837 --> 01:51:17.659
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know who the purple rhino was?

01:51:18.320 --> 01:51:19.301
[SPEAKER_02]: The embossed Maldred Beast.

01:51:20.202 --> 01:51:21.524
[SPEAKER_06]: With the fancy unicorns.

01:51:21.860 --> 01:51:23.642
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:51:42.697 --> 01:51:44.979
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's go to Facebook because we had some good answers on Facebook.

01:52:05.800 --> 01:52:32.786
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree and I don't agree with you I think there's the potential to do other movies in this universe that's been established but I kind of draw the line at the Captain N thing remember, Mario's not in this movie because if Mario had been in the movie it would have been about Mario and the movie's not about the existing video game characters all the existing video game characters play supporting roles and that's what's really cool about it but Nintendo, a Captain N video game would be pretty awesome

01:52:33.286 --> 01:52:35.708
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Captain N was absolute shit.

01:52:36.309 --> 01:52:39.372
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they could fix all the wrongs, you know, all the 80s weird stuff.

01:52:39.392 --> 01:52:41.734
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, like Simon Belmont being all weird and stuff.

01:52:41.774 --> 01:52:44.056
[SPEAKER_07]: But if they fix all that, it could be pretty cool.

01:52:44.476 --> 01:52:46.238
[SPEAKER_06]: Xenocorn, our chatroom, agrees with you, by the way.

01:52:46.458 --> 01:52:47.519
[SPEAKER_06]: Live.VogNetwork.com.

01:52:47.559 --> 01:52:49.401
[SPEAKER_06]: He says, Captain N, the hell you say.

01:52:49.461 --> 01:52:50.642
[SPEAKER_06]: We can do better than Captain N.

01:52:51.050 --> 01:52:51.891
[SPEAKER_04]: Mega high.

01:52:53.352 --> 01:52:58.815
[SPEAKER_06]: Osfer says, honestly, I think Wreck-It Ralph did do well due to it being a Pixar film.

01:52:59.295 --> 01:53:00.556
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, I got fooled, buddy.

01:53:00.596 --> 01:53:01.216
[SPEAKER_06]: He got fooled.

01:53:01.537 --> 01:53:02.877
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like a Pixar film.

01:53:02.917 --> 01:53:03.238
[SPEAKER_06]: It was.

01:53:03.638 --> 01:53:04.559
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at the opening.

01:53:04.619 --> 01:53:06.200
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Disney Classic Studio.

01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:10.042
[SPEAKER_02]: But it did have the Pixar logo right at the top.

01:53:10.943 --> 01:53:27.286
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was produced by Lasseter It was produced by one of the Pixar guys Although technically it's in the same This is the same studio that did Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and more recently Tangled Which is a very similar film, also not Pixar But it was produced by Lasseter

01:53:27.426 --> 01:53:28.146
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, so.

01:53:28.746 --> 01:53:35.288
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, it's just, you know, this is where Disney, having bought Pixar, this is where you're really starting to see the fruits of them coming together.

01:53:35.608 --> 01:53:41.149
[SPEAKER_06]: But Brave was the Pixar film from this year, and Monsters 3, Monsters U or whatever is their big movie next year.

01:53:42.770 --> 01:53:47.431
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the next Disney movie, the Disney classic movie next year is The Frozen.

01:53:47.511 --> 01:53:47.751
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:53:47.791 --> 01:53:48.511
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, so.

01:53:49.672 --> 01:54:05.789
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyhow, continuing on with Osfer's comment I'm not calling you out or anything I'm just saying you made a mistake a lot of people are making And Pixar movies are great Maybe that was intentional There really is not a bad Pixar movie Unless it was a sequel to a mediocre one

01:54:06.449 --> 01:54:12.050
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, those are usually the most hyped up films and it's rare to turn on the TV without seeing an ad for the movie.

01:54:12.491 --> 01:54:16.612
[SPEAKER_06]: It's my opinion that the movie that truly did well for video games went overlooked.

01:54:17.112 --> 01:54:24.914
[SPEAKER_06]: Silent Hill Revelation was the closest video game to film adaptation I've ever seen and future video game related movies could learn from it.

01:54:25.194 --> 01:54:25.834
[SPEAKER_02]: Which reminds me.

01:54:26.194 --> 01:54:27.014
[SPEAKER_06]: We still need to go see it.

01:54:27.834 --> 01:54:29.095
[SPEAKER_02]: I have another friend that wants to see it too.

01:54:29.475 --> 01:54:29.755
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:54:30.015 --> 01:54:30.215
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

01:54:30.976 --> 01:54:32.317
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll try to make that happen this week.

01:54:32.837 --> 01:54:36.678
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I can't really respond to that because I haven't seen Silent Hill Revelation still.

01:54:37.419 --> 01:54:38.179
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on my radar.

01:54:38.219 --> 01:54:39.600
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to get that seen this week.

01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:42.661
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll have to come back to that next week.

01:54:44.708 --> 01:54:56.480
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have seen it if I had power, but wanted to wonder if anyone else noticed how some reviewers were comparing this to Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and that you saw multiple characters from different franchises in the same movie.

01:54:56.860 --> 01:55:05.149
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I didn't think I liked that comparison at first, but now I think I do, because again, in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, none of those characters were the star.

01:55:06.090 --> 01:55:08.152
[SPEAKER_06]: Roger Rabbit, Eddie, and Jessica Rabbit

01:55:24.306 --> 01:55:28.469
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, moving on to DarkCharger who says, I saw this with my young son yesterday.

01:55:28.949 --> 01:55:31.530
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great video game movie and a good movie overall.

01:55:31.911 --> 01:55:41.396
[SPEAKER_06]: While it doesn't belong in the pantheon of animated films, it is a great love letter to every sort of gamer, especially to those that live through the golden age of the arcade who may enjoy this film even more.

01:55:41.977 --> 01:55:48.581
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that it drives strength in its narrative by not simply focusing on video games, but by not forgetting about the characters.

01:55:49.021 --> 01:55:49.701
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a pretty good review.

01:55:51.212 --> 01:55:52.973
[SPEAKER_02]: Chiggers replied and said, I really liked Wreck-It Ralph.

01:55:53.033 --> 01:55:57.917
[SPEAKER_02]: My only complaint is that I wish they would have had more of the other classic game characters had more of a role.

01:55:58.037 --> 01:56:01.099
[SPEAKER_06]: I respect their decision to not do that because I think it would have taken away...

01:56:18.171 --> 01:56:33.105
[SPEAKER_06]: it was very interesting to me that one of the media supporting roles went to and again I don't think this is spoiling anything I think I'm okay saying this one of the media supporting roles went to Qbert because Qbert's one of those characters where it's like he's not

01:56:34.289 --> 01:56:43.283
[SPEAKER_06]: A Mario or a Sonic per se, but he's very recognizable if you were alive in the 80s or if you have a knowledge of 80s gaming.

01:56:43.624 --> 01:56:44.165
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

01:56:44.725 --> 01:56:49.092
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, did you kind of feel that way, Jamie, that that was a very interesting character to have be a supporting character?

01:56:49.313 --> 01:56:49.473
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:56:50.494 --> 01:56:51.014
[SPEAKER_06]: But it worked.

01:56:51.955 --> 01:56:53.136
[SPEAKER_06]: So, anyhow.

01:56:55.077 --> 01:56:56.158
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, moving on.

01:56:56.538 --> 01:56:57.319
[SPEAKER_06]: TheRobD says,

01:57:10.089 --> 01:57:17.070
[SPEAKER_06]: As a lifelong gamer, I find it refreshing to see them treated as the creative medium and source of enjoyment for so many that they are.

01:57:17.490 --> 01:57:20.291
[SPEAKER_06]: Not something that only nerds and basement dwellers partake in.

01:57:20.891 --> 01:57:22.371
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, the bottom line is this.

01:57:22.791 --> 01:57:26.112
[SPEAKER_06]: Wreck-It Ralph treats both video games and gamers with respect.

01:57:26.492 --> 01:57:32.473
[SPEAKER_06]: The people who created it did a wonderful job of capturing the joy of games and the world's Wii gamers experience.

01:57:32.793 --> 01:57:36.074
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the first time that's ever happened and they should be lauded for it.

01:57:36.514 --> 01:57:39.436
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's hope that this is the start of a trend and not an aberration.

01:57:39.836 --> 01:57:41.737
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a very solid comment.

01:57:41.757 --> 01:57:42.277
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.

01:57:43.758 --> 01:57:45.779
[SPEAKER_06]: One more comment here from Degenerate Johnny.

01:57:46.539 --> 01:57:48.240
[SPEAKER_06]: This is also a very interesting comment.

01:57:48.260 --> 01:57:53.102
[SPEAKER_06]: I like this one a lot, and this is the last one I'm going to read here from Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

01:57:53.723 --> 01:58:01.126
[SPEAKER_06]: Degenerate Johnny says, I will admit that the movie was quite entertaining, and I think that it places video games in a better light, which is something the industry needs.

01:58:01.547 --> 01:58:05.669
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I'm not sure if Wreck-It Ralph is a good thing for the progression of video games.

01:58:06.229 --> 01:58:12.191
[SPEAKER_06]: The industry has grown up considerably since its inception, but it is still considered by many media outlets i.e.

01:58:12.271 --> 01:58:14.851
[SPEAKER_06]: Fox News and CNN as a child's toy.

01:58:15.512 --> 01:58:23.274
[SPEAKER_06]: Therefore, having a successful family-friendly video game movie may be a form of support to those who heavily criticize the industry for its violent games.

01:58:23.914 --> 01:58:30.015
[SPEAKER_06]: Interactive entertainment is the entertainment of this age, as was motion pictures the entertainment of the industrial age.

01:58:30.675 --> 01:58:37.316
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, I don't think that it's fair to interpret an entertainment industry based on its interactions with other forms of entertainment.

01:58:38.016 --> 01:58:44.357
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't interpret William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet through that horrid excuse of a movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio.

01:58:44.698 --> 01:58:47.638
[SPEAKER_06]: The views and opinions of OLR's fans do not reflect that of OLR.

01:58:47.938 --> 01:58:48.738
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn right they don't.

01:58:48.778 --> 01:58:49.518
[SPEAKER_06]: I love that movie.

01:58:49.778 --> 01:58:50.298
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

01:58:50.499 --> 01:58:53.099
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate that play so much because they're both stupid.

01:58:53.738 --> 01:58:56.580
[SPEAKER_06]: I do agree there's better Shakespeare plays than Romeo and Juliet, for sure.

01:58:56.800 --> 01:58:57.040
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

01:58:57.081 --> 01:58:57.681
[SPEAKER_02]: The theme of that?

01:58:58.001 --> 01:58:58.822
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, we're stupid.

01:58:58.842 --> 01:58:59.442
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's kill each other.

01:58:59.562 --> 01:58:59.943
[SPEAKER_02]: The end.

01:59:00.843 --> 01:59:09.790
[SPEAKER_06]: Wreck-It Ralph was simply a fun-filled children's movie that I hope to God will only be viewed as such if interactive entertainment is to be accepted as the next form of entertainment.

01:59:10.510 --> 01:59:14.793
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that was a very interesting comment because of the whole... And this is the part that really got me.

01:59:15.474 --> 01:59:21.118
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it's fair to interpret an entertainment industry based on its interactions with other forms of entertainment.

01:59:21.778 --> 01:59:23.019
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think about that statement?

01:59:23.239 --> 01:59:25.020
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think that's a good statement that he's making there?

01:59:26.280 --> 01:59:37.686
[SPEAKER_06]: It does seem like gamers, especially in gaming blogs and the things we read on the internet, it does seem like gamers are really obsessed with how does the news report on us?

01:59:38.167 --> 01:59:40.248
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we get portrayed in movies?

01:59:40.868 --> 01:59:44.430
[SPEAKER_06]: It does seem like that always piques a curiosity.

01:59:44.990 --> 01:59:46.791
[SPEAKER_06]: I just thought it was a neat way of looking at it.

01:59:46.831 --> 01:59:46.891
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

02:00:07.992 --> 02:00:11.173
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very kind of, it actually strikes me as somewhat abstract.

02:00:12.173 --> 02:00:12.393
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah?

02:00:12.553 --> 02:00:30.338
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you look at taking one genre and portraying it in another genre, then any type of biography about artists, about, shoot, toy story, toys coming to life and doing stuff.

02:00:31.974 --> 02:00:32.655
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:00:50.051 --> 02:00:54.114
[SPEAKER_06]: because silent movies were way different than movies today.

02:00:54.174 --> 02:01:03.100
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell, even when there was silent movies, you needed the piano guy sitting there at the front playing, you know, those two industries have always really needed each other.

02:01:03.740 --> 02:01:06.482
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of the best music was inspired by movies.

02:01:07.263 --> 02:01:12.747
[SPEAKER_02]: Or have you, well, music just goes with some, like, here's going to be a really dumb example.

02:01:13.267 --> 02:01:15.428
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you ever written California Screamin' without the soundtrack?

02:01:16.309 --> 02:01:17.630
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, when my chair was broken.

02:01:18.706 --> 02:01:20.027
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it not a little different?

02:01:20.107 --> 02:01:21.207
[SPEAKER_06]: It was not as good.

02:01:21.467 --> 02:01:21.728
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

02:01:22.388 --> 02:01:24.969
[SPEAKER_02]: Or changing the music and things.

02:01:25.089 --> 02:01:32.773
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I really like how a lot of times for showing a suspenseful part in a movie or a game, they'll just use silence.

02:01:33.814 --> 02:01:41.578
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of, they'll let you focus on the sounds going on, not just scary music to let you know it's scary.

02:01:41.598 --> 02:01:41.998
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

02:01:44.340 --> 02:01:48.364
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, we'll end it on this comment in the chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

02:01:48.745 --> 02:01:52.289
[SPEAKER_06]: Xenacore says, Rob, the answer to your question is porn.

02:01:53.570 --> 02:01:56.934
[SPEAKER_02]: Robert M. also says that there are a lot of classic toys in Toy Story.

02:01:58.976 --> 02:02:00.217
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what about...

02:02:03.633 --> 02:02:03.973
[SPEAKER_02]: Books.

02:02:04.673 --> 02:02:06.354
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we've kind of had The NeverEnding Story.

02:02:06.834 --> 02:02:08.195
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that, The Pagemaster?

02:02:08.455 --> 02:02:10.716
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, people were into that movie.

02:02:10.896 --> 02:02:12.317
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to say it.

02:02:13.097 --> 02:02:17.699
[SPEAKER_02]: Or even take comics.

02:02:17.919 --> 02:02:21.160
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a different genre of story.

02:02:21.260 --> 02:02:22.681
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, the whole Fable series.

02:02:23.459 --> 02:02:25.521
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, you just really hit on something.

02:02:25.541 --> 02:02:32.567
[SPEAKER_06]: Because something that's really huge now that wasn't as big years ago was the comics and movies.

02:02:32.947 --> 02:02:34.648
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a huge thing in the industry now.

02:02:34.768 --> 02:02:46.278
[SPEAKER_06]: And really, before the past few years, you would occasionally have Superman was huge in the 70s, and Batman was huge in the 90s, the Burton series.

02:02:46.658 --> 02:02:50.321
[SPEAKER_06]: But comics are kind of big in movies now in a way where...

02:02:50.501 --> 02:03:18.994
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't seen I have a reason to see Guardians of the Galaxy now Rocket Raccoon Anyway The whole reason I think with that and also why I think Wreck-It Ralph is doing well is that the audience the target audience being also the same age group of an audience that's going to have the money and maybe have kids but also be the people who are going to get it That's the ones you want to market to is our age demographic

02:03:20.498 --> 02:03:27.651
[SPEAKER_02]: and on top of that, we grew up I grew up reading X-Men and Avengers, you know I didn't read DC because DC sucks

02:03:30.138 --> 02:03:59.570
[SPEAKER_02]: um sorry my allergies my sinus infection is getting the best of me um but uh you know we grew up playing these games it's we are at the age that we are the ones with money and the influence not in the corporate world of course because that's bullshit Occupy um but uh as far as what dictates what's popular in pop culture in in modern popular culture we're the age group

02:04:01.431 --> 02:04:04.053
[SPEAKER_06]: There are too many deep discussions happening on tonight's show.

02:04:04.093 --> 02:04:04.894
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't understand.

02:04:04.934 --> 02:04:05.975
[SPEAKER_06]: What is in the air tonight?

02:04:06.035 --> 02:04:08.217
[SPEAKER_06]: Where am I taking fart jokes that I came here for?

02:04:08.237 --> 02:04:08.797
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't get it.

02:04:09.418 --> 02:04:09.758
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't worry.

02:04:10.058 --> 02:04:11.840
[SPEAKER_02]: My next story has raccoon penis in it.

02:04:11.980 --> 02:04:12.280
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

02:04:12.821 --> 02:04:13.101
[SPEAKER_06]: Phew.

02:04:13.221 --> 02:04:15.663
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, before we get to your story, then we got to do a couple more.

02:04:15.723 --> 02:04:16.904
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's get back into some news.

02:04:17.024 --> 02:04:21.368
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, we will be opening up the Skype line later if you want to call and voice your opinion on any of this.

02:04:21.388 --> 02:04:25.371
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

02:04:25.611 --> 02:04:26.052
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Loki.

02:04:26.092 --> 02:04:27.573
[SPEAKER_06]: I needed to plug that before we get to that.

02:04:27.853 --> 02:04:29.194
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a problem.

02:04:29.274 --> 02:04:43.304
[SPEAKER_07]: Since a lot of the whole online plan for the Wii U has been kind of non-existent or hidden or secret or whatever, it is kind of refreshing to see that there's some information, including now what their web browser is going to be.

02:04:43.364 --> 02:04:47.967
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if there's anything to really be excited about, but here we go.

02:04:48.628 --> 02:04:56.333
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, it's based off the whole NetFront browser, which has been used in pretty much all the portable gaming systems.

02:04:56.713 --> 02:04:56.914
[SPEAKER_07]: The

02:04:57.614 --> 02:05:10.608
[SPEAKER_07]: DS, 3DS, PSP, Vita, and of course, you know, the Wii U. It's based a little bit off of, you know, they've got Mozilla kind of backing a little bit of the Apple WebKit as well.

02:05:11.389 --> 02:05:16.134
[SPEAKER_07]: And then a little bit of, I guess, the Nintendo browser, which is good or bad.

02:05:16.955 --> 02:05:23.104
[SPEAKER_07]: It will support HTML5, of course, no Flash, because everyone's kind of saying HTML5 is the way to go anyways.

02:05:24.025 --> 02:05:29.834
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if we had Flash, we'd be able to play all of those virtual console games for free, and Nintendo has to know this.

02:05:30.415 --> 02:05:31.196
[SPEAKER_06]: They have to know this.

02:05:31.316 --> 02:05:31.997
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, of course.

02:05:34.059 --> 02:05:38.582
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to support MP4 files as well as live streaming.

02:05:40.644 --> 02:05:46.108
[SPEAKER_07]: MPEG-4 AVC video, the H.2.64 format.

02:05:46.288 --> 02:05:47.909
[SPEAKER_07]: Although some may not be playable.

02:05:48.009 --> 02:05:52.913
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, it will support just the regular level HTML4, 5...

02:05:55.014 --> 02:06:03.597
[SPEAKER_07]: X, HTML 1.1, CSS 1, 2, or 2.1 and 3, although those are partially functioning, like S3 is partially functioning.

02:06:04.417 --> 02:06:13.660
[SPEAKER_07]: And they say even like video web storage is partially functioning, web messaging and some other stuff there.

02:06:16.332 --> 02:06:19.933
[SPEAKER_07]: No plugins, obviously, because it's built into the system there.

02:06:20.734 --> 02:06:28.298
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess they're saying that the browser will support some touch event stuff, like a touch start, touch end, move, cancel.

02:06:28.518 --> 02:06:30.799
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm assuming it's all the stuff that you would have with a touch patch.

02:06:30.899 --> 02:06:31.660
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing.

02:06:31.920 --> 02:06:35.643
[SPEAKER_06]: Will it be fast and responsive and easy?

02:06:35.744 --> 02:06:42.009
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the problem with so many of these browsers on the TV and all this stuff is that they run like shit.

02:06:42.390 --> 02:06:45.513
[SPEAKER_06]: It's faster to just whip my phone out of my pocket and get what I need.

02:06:45.653 --> 02:06:48.936
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they're saying right now that it's supposed to be, I guess...

02:06:50.797 --> 02:07:08.382
[SPEAKER_07]: It does support HTML5, and I guess because it renders HTML5 websites more effectively than any other console, even faster than Internet Explorer, they're saying that it's pretty good, I guess?

02:07:09.282 --> 02:07:09.562
[SPEAKER_06]: Html5 Test

02:07:33.660 --> 02:07:35.481
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a gaming tab on there.

02:07:36.061 --> 02:07:41.543
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, there's not a lot of gaming browsers that support HTML5.

02:07:42.184 --> 02:07:44.065
[SPEAKER_07]: The 3DS and Xbox 360.

02:07:44.165 --> 02:07:44.845
[SPEAKER_07]: The 3DS got a 109.

02:07:45.025 --> 02:07:47.166
[SPEAKER_07]: The Xbox 360 is a 120.

02:07:47.306 --> 02:07:51.007
[SPEAKER_07]: And then, of course, the other browsers right now.

02:07:51.027 --> 02:07:52.788
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess Wii does support it a little bit.

02:07:53.028 --> 02:07:54.349
[SPEAKER_07]: Wii's got a 94 and the DSi a 94.

02:07:54.489 --> 02:07:55.389
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Vita, a 58.

02:08:01.400 --> 02:08:26.288
[SPEAKER_07]: in the course right now they're saying although it lists the Vita again I guess for HTML5 maybe that's like HTML4 scores or something like that but for in the future or in development the Wii U a 323 and I guess the Vita is a 243 I'm assuming that's maybe an update or something so I don't know like I said where they're getting their information as far as how they're scoring that but

02:08:28.977 --> 02:08:30.218
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting, I guess.

02:08:31.299 --> 02:08:35.542
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to see if there's any other comparisons with tablets.

02:08:35.622 --> 02:08:37.704
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so let's look at tablets real quick.

02:08:38.464 --> 02:08:41.586
[SPEAKER_07]: And as you would expect, the tablets are better.

02:08:42.727 --> 02:08:44.709
[SPEAKER_07]: The 323 is the Wii U's benchmark there.

02:08:45.489 --> 02:08:49.272
[SPEAKER_07]: And right now, they have Opera Mobile 12.

02:08:49.532 --> 02:08:49.752
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a 406.

02:08:50.633 --> 02:08:51.133
[SPEAKER_07]: And Chrome's 390.

02:08:51.173 --> 02:08:56.217
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to see what else would be the closest there.

02:08:57.618 --> 02:09:21.797
[SPEAKER_07]: Even Windows Phone 8 is close, 320, iOS 6 is a 386, Firefox Mobile, 388 So it does sound like your phone is going to be better at rendering those pages But it's not as bad, even TVs are better at it But for gaming, out of gaming consoles, it is the best

02:09:22.848 --> 02:09:32.957
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if that's really saying much, but when I can get my hands on it and try it, that's when I can't really say one way or the other.

02:09:33.677 --> 02:09:35.619
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even know where they're getting it.

02:09:35.659 --> 02:09:38.621
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't say what they're testing.

02:09:38.681 --> 02:09:45.087
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really know what they're testing and how they're even testing a system that's not out yet.

02:09:46.678 --> 02:09:51.879
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I have some potpourri news involving Nintendo, and it means I have a few little things I want to get out here.

02:09:52.879 --> 02:09:58.241
[SPEAKER_06]: One of them is about finally some details on what exactly the Nintendo Network Premium involves.

02:09:59.041 --> 02:10:05.542
[SPEAKER_06]: You remember the Wii U Deluxe Edition that has Nintendo Land as a packing game also gets this whole Nintendo Network Premium.

02:10:05.602 --> 02:10:07.083
[SPEAKER_06]: So what the hell is this all about?

02:10:07.143 --> 02:10:13.004
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, basically, you get 10% back in points that you spend on the Wii U shop.

02:10:13.604 --> 02:10:27.548
[SPEAKER_06]: so if you get the 32 gig Wii U with the game you get Nintendo Network Premium and you get 10% back in points if you buy a Wii U game on the eShop so let's say you buy a game for $59.99 10% of that's $5.99 points so there you go you get $5 in eShop credit for every 500 points

02:10:33.209 --> 02:10:42.017
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically buying a game like New Super Mario Bros.

02:10:42.577 --> 02:10:48.582
[SPEAKER_06]: Wii U online would get you enough points to buy the original Mario Bros.

02:10:48.622 --> 02:10:52.826
[SPEAKER_06]: on the virtual console So a little something there

02:10:53.326 --> 02:11:02.561
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very similar to what the Vita does already, where you get 10% off, but that 10% that you save is not tied to their store.

02:11:02.781 --> 02:11:08.009
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just money in your pocket versus having this money be...

02:11:08.690 --> 02:11:11.774
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, I don't see downloading games as kind of an option.

02:11:11.854 --> 02:11:12.976
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

02:11:13.656 --> 02:11:20.244
[SPEAKER_07]: With how fickle I get with games and stuff like that, you would want to have the option to sell it back or something.

02:11:20.705 --> 02:11:23.989
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not really much of an incentive, I guess.

02:11:24.009 --> 02:11:24.690
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

02:11:24.870 --> 02:11:25.291
[SPEAKER_06]: Super Mario Bros.

02:11:25.331 --> 02:11:25.931
[SPEAKER_06]: U Challenge Mode

02:11:42.829 --> 02:11:48.790
[SPEAKER_06]: There's categories that include time attack, coin collection, one-up rally, and special, which is basically miscellaneous.

02:11:49.190 --> 02:11:52.471
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also boost mode challenges that will require two players.

02:11:52.971 --> 02:11:56.612
[SPEAKER_06]: Once you complete a challenge, a replay is saved so you can show that off.

02:11:57.012 --> 02:12:05.274
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also coin battle, where up to four players will go through the course and see who can collect the most coins, not unlike the recent 3DS release.

02:12:06.414 --> 02:12:35.243
[SPEAKER_06]: another player can use the Wii U gamepad in boost mode to place boost blocks to help grab a hard to reach coin you can use the gamepad to edit and customize the coin layout in dedicated courses that layout can then be saved and played by players using the Wii remote controllers at least that sounds kind of new and interesting I'm curious how that plays out coins everywhere world map

02:12:36.345 --> 02:12:36.605
[SPEAKER_06]: NABBIT

02:12:52.646 --> 02:13:00.633
[SPEAKER_06]: A creature named Nabbit from time to time will appear on the world map if you enter the course and catch Nabbit to recover items stolen from Toad.

02:13:01.393 --> 02:13:06.738
[SPEAKER_06]: If you get Nabbit, you get a pea acorn which will allow you to fly continuously through an entire stage.

02:13:06.758 --> 02:13:10.161
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm assuming that is like the pea wing from Mario 3.

02:13:13.123 --> 02:13:20.769
[SPEAKER_06]: And one other thing, you know, Loki, you give Nintendo a lot of shit on this show, but you gotta applaud Nintendo for this comment this week.

02:13:21.810 --> 02:13:35.175
[SPEAKER_06]: Satoru Iwata in talking about Animal Crossing New Leaf on the Nintendo 3DS mentioning all of the download content will be free because charging consumers for the DLC would not be cool.

02:13:35.255 --> 02:13:40.437
[SPEAKER_06]: Quote, that sort of element, paid DLC, is absolutely not being added.

02:13:40.777 --> 02:13:43.098
[SPEAKER_06]: He went so far as to call it unwholesome.

02:13:43.638 --> 02:13:48.600
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically like, you know, they could have charged for new patterns and silly, they're not going to do it.

02:13:50.020 --> 02:13:53.242
[SPEAKER_06]: They thought about it, but they decided not to do it.

02:13:54.143 --> 02:13:56.805
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, Nintendo's biggest critic on this show.

02:13:57.768 --> 02:14:23.984
[SPEAKER_07]: wasn't that the right call to make well yeah it's the the most common sense call to make and let's be honest the first party companies aren't really the ones that are being known for all this on disc content I don't think that Sony has a whole lot of games that kind of nickel and dime you for things and I don't think that Microsoft has any any similar games like that as well so cool you're on equal standing with everybody else third party companies well that's

02:14:24.284 --> 02:14:24.844
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:14:43.160 --> 02:14:45.442
[SPEAKER_02]: What does raccoon penis have to do with video games?

02:14:46.122 --> 02:14:53.027
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually has to do with a digital art group called Massive Black.

02:14:53.887 --> 02:15:01.572
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've done a lot of concept art for Lord of the Rings Online, Infamous 2, Silent Hill Shattered Memories, and Transformers 3.

02:15:02.933 --> 02:15:05.835
[SPEAKER_02]: They also developed their own game.

02:15:05.875 --> 02:15:12.960
[SPEAKER_02]: They have an artistic demo out called Moth Head that they're using to show the Unity platform.

02:15:14.421 --> 02:15:18.423
[SPEAKER_02]: I downloaded this because honestly I had heard of the art piece that it was based off of.

02:15:19.123 --> 02:15:31.709
[SPEAKER_02]: It's based off of a sculpture that is, well, it has a giant phallus on it made from the real bone of a raccoon penis.

02:15:33.129 --> 02:15:36.891
[SPEAKER_02]: And if no one believes me, I will pull up the image and show everybody.

02:15:37.171 --> 02:15:38.072
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, no, I believe you.

02:15:38.132 --> 02:15:38.472
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fine.

02:15:39.592 --> 02:15:40.413
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com.

02:16:06.988 --> 02:16:34.837
[SPEAKER_02]: it's actually supposed to be similar to and I'm going to mispronounce this as Botanicula I think it's still a demo I mean the controls aren't great I downloaded it it was originally conceived as a full length game and they still want to do it but right now it's sort of on hold while they finish their clients work because they still have huge groups that they're doing artwork for but

02:16:36.511 --> 02:16:38.052
[SPEAKER_02]: It's absolutely gorgeous to me.

02:16:38.132 --> 02:16:41.495
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I freaking love concept art.

02:16:42.276 --> 02:16:49.781
[SPEAKER_02]: And just the fact that they would take this sculpture and turn it into a figure in a game just to sort of like combining two of my favorite things.

02:16:50.422 --> 02:16:53.124
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, fine modern art and video games.

02:16:53.204 --> 02:16:57.347
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll post the link of the image in the chat room.

02:16:59.049 --> 02:16:59.369
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

02:17:01.130 --> 02:17:01.831
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on, Loki.

02:17:01.851 --> 02:17:01.931
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

02:17:02.589 --> 02:17:14.094
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, so, I don't know, we talked about, we talked a lot about a recent video, I don't even really call it a video game movie, but a video game based movie.

02:17:15.935 --> 02:17:23.279
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about another one that probably won't turn out as well, and that would be Castle Wolfenstein, the movie.

02:17:24.379 --> 02:17:29.982
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, they've got Roger Avery back on his role as the writer and director for the movie.

02:17:30.642 --> 02:17:32.744
[SPEAKER_07]: Doom Level Skip

02:17:54.648 --> 02:17:54.988
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

02:17:56.210 --> 02:17:59.032
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyways, their plot, if we must go back in there.

02:17:59.413 --> 02:18:00.454
[SPEAKER_07]: A young U.S.

02:18:00.754 --> 02:18:11.424
[SPEAKER_07]: Army captain and British special agent are on a top secret mission to Castle Wolfenstein where Hitler will be unveiling a new secret weapon.

02:18:12.986 --> 02:18:13.987
[SPEAKER_07]: That sounds awfully generic.

02:18:14.067 --> 02:18:17.430
[SPEAKER_07]: Does this mean the Hitler robot that was the boss of one of the... I hope so.

02:18:17.590 --> 02:18:17.991
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh boy.

02:18:19.710 --> 02:18:21.732
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be, I think it could be dumb fun.

02:18:22.252 --> 02:18:24.154
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as it we bowls not attached to it, which he is.

02:18:24.234 --> 02:18:25.295
[SPEAKER_07]: Emphasis on dumb.

02:18:26.637 --> 02:18:27.117
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

02:18:28.378 --> 02:18:30.280
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, I think this is kind of neat.

02:18:30.380 --> 02:18:36.786
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, you know, Sega is no stranger to repackaging their old shit, and they've done it a lot, a lot.

02:18:37.427 --> 02:18:45.735
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, the various collections, whether it be download, PC, or these little hook them up directly to your TV things, right?

02:18:47.135 --> 02:18:49.156
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a new one on the way out.

02:18:49.236 --> 02:18:52.377
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called the Sega Genesis Ultimate Portable Game Player.

02:18:52.878 --> 02:18:54.638
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's coming out November 13th.

02:18:54.698 --> 02:18:55.779
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to cost $59.99.

02:18:56.419 --> 02:19:01.201
[SPEAKER_06]: That's $60 for a Genesis, but it has 80 games built in.

02:19:01.221 --> 02:19:02.541
[SPEAKER_02]: That looks vaguely like a Nomad.

02:19:04.142 --> 02:19:05.662
[SPEAKER_06]: 37 of them are going to be from Sega.

02:19:06.263 --> 02:19:06.643
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry.

02:19:07.203 --> 02:19:09.444
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this one that you plug into your TV?

02:19:09.524 --> 02:19:11.065
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it looks like a portable system, doesn't it?

02:19:11.085 --> 02:19:11.665
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be both.

02:19:11.945 --> 02:19:12.745
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be both.

02:19:12.765 --> 02:19:14.806
[SPEAKER_02]: You could do it with the Nomad.

02:19:15.839 --> 02:19:18.661
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm trying to see real quick if that... I'm not sure.

02:19:18.761 --> 02:19:26.145
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, there's 37 of these games from Sega, 3 from Capcom, and 40 from an assortment of other publishers.

02:19:26.586 --> 02:19:27.286
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the thing.

02:19:27.506 --> 02:19:32.669
[SPEAKER_06]: One of those Capcom games that's going to be on this player, Mega Man The Wily Wars.

02:19:33.690 --> 02:19:44.417
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if you don't know what this game is, it's remakes of the first three Mega Mans on the NES along with a game called Wily Tower, like a little mini-game.

02:19:45.057 --> 02:19:45.900
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:19:51.448 --> 02:19:53.770
[SPEAKER_06]: But how many people actually had the Sega Channel?

02:19:54.170 --> 02:19:57.293
[SPEAKER_06]: So most people missed this when it was first out.

02:19:57.333 --> 02:20:01.817
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's very interesting that all these years later, the Wily Wars is actually going to be out.

02:20:01.897 --> 02:20:05.220
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I'm sure half you out there have already emulated this at this point.

02:20:05.320 --> 02:20:09.103
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's still worth saying that this is on its way out.

02:20:09.144 --> 02:20:11.426
[SPEAKER_06]: And who knows what other goodies could be in there.

02:20:11.466 --> 02:20:13.527
[SPEAKER_06]: The only way we know about this one is it's on the box.

02:20:14.128 --> 02:20:15.489
[SPEAKER_06]: So who knows what else is in there.

02:20:15.529 --> 02:20:17.551
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty awesome.

02:20:18.143 --> 02:20:19.665
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:20:37.083 --> 02:20:39.465
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a 2.8 inch LCD screen.

02:20:39.506 --> 02:20:40.587
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a handheld player.

02:20:41.027 --> 02:20:42.448
[SPEAKER_06]: Rechargeable battery built in.

02:20:42.568 --> 02:20:45.151
[SPEAKER_06]: USB cable included for charging battery.

02:20:45.171 --> 02:20:46.713
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't look like you can hook it up to the TV.

02:20:46.733 --> 02:20:48.514
[SPEAKER_02]: I still recommend Power Battle.

02:20:50.756 --> 02:20:51.157
[SPEAKER_06]: Never know.

02:20:53.482 --> 02:20:54.663
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so there you go.

02:20:55.884 --> 02:20:57.985
[SPEAKER_06]: Something new all these years later in the US.

02:20:58.786 --> 02:20:59.827
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to the email bag.

02:20:59.967 --> 02:21:04.851
[SPEAKER_06]: Every week we collect your emails at mailbag at orangelawnsradio.com All one of them?

02:21:05.231 --> 02:21:05.791
[SPEAKER_06]: All one of them.

02:21:05.811 --> 02:21:09.794
[SPEAKER_06]: So DarkSakura's going to dive into the email bag and say, hello, hello, hello.

02:21:10.275 --> 02:21:11.295
[SPEAKER_06]: And then she'll look on the ground.

02:21:11.455 --> 02:21:15.338
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, one lone little email in here.

02:21:15.538 --> 02:21:17.620
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me just reach down here and pick it up.

02:21:18.761 --> 02:21:21.623
[SPEAKER_06]: And she'll read that one email on the air here tonight.

02:21:22.057 --> 02:21:22.738
[SPEAKER_02]: And here it is.

02:21:23.899 --> 02:21:28.363
[SPEAKER_02]: I see that the stores have Wreck-It Ralph toys, but only three characters in the first wave.

02:21:28.903 --> 02:21:31.065
[SPEAKER_02]: Ralph Fix-It Felix Jr.

02:21:31.526 --> 02:21:33.407
[SPEAKER_02]: and Ralph in the Hero's Duty armor.

02:21:34.248 --> 02:21:34.588
[SPEAKER_02]: Duty.

02:21:35.489 --> 02:21:39.132
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand why they can't flood the shelves with Bowser's, Clyde's, and Q-Bert's.

02:21:39.893 --> 02:21:41.513
[SPEAKER_02]: Who even holds that license now?

02:21:41.713 --> 02:21:47.054
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a New York holding company licenses the Gotlight pinball tables, but what about the arcade cabinet games?

02:21:47.555 --> 02:21:51.555
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now, more of the movie's original characters seem to be Disney Store only.

02:21:52.336 --> 02:21:56.496
[SPEAKER_02]: And just to ask Loki, seriously this time, you mentioned suffering from weekend headaches.

02:21:57.277 --> 02:22:00.937
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something affecting me as well, so what does your doctor think is causing it?

02:22:01.057 --> 02:22:02.098
[SPEAKER_02]: Allergies or stress, maybe?

02:22:02.118 --> 02:22:04.098
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, it'll go to my doctor.

02:22:06.081 --> 02:22:08.183
[SPEAKER_07]: I should show you the pillow that I use that got rid of most of my headaches.

02:22:22.910 --> 02:22:29.334
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki also gets a lot of stress caused by this show because he pops blood vessels every time a Nintendo story comes up.

02:22:29.394 --> 02:22:30.194
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's be real.

02:22:30.234 --> 02:22:31.315
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen that eye twitch.

02:22:32.435 --> 02:22:40.920
[SPEAKER_06]: That comes from Robert M. The first part of the thing about the licensed toys, I think honestly that just would have cost Disney extra money.

02:22:41.200 --> 02:22:42.961
[SPEAKER_06]: Disney doesn't want to push...

02:22:44.162 --> 02:23:05.718
[SPEAKER_06]: other people's properties they want to push their own properties and remember and I don't know if you've actually seen the movie yet or what have you but remember the movie just uses all these licensed stuff to kind of get you into the plot that involves characters that are not based off of real games so of course Disney wants to build their own characters so you know

02:23:06.638 --> 02:23:07.999
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's what it really boils down to.

02:23:26.752 --> 02:23:40.440
[SPEAKER_06]: I think everybody recognizes Road Blasters, but did Road Blasters really have that same financial impact and did it make that same kind of money that maybe other comparable racing games did, like Pole Position, per se?

02:23:41.040 --> 02:23:41.640
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably not.

02:23:41.740 --> 02:23:44.042
[SPEAKER_06]: Or Iron Man, Off-Road, Stewart, that whole thing?

02:23:44.362 --> 02:23:46.123
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably not, but everybody recognizes it.

02:23:46.403 --> 02:23:47.064
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:24:12.282 --> 02:24:15.304
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there is an actual DDR machine in the movie.

02:24:15.344 --> 02:24:15.645
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.

02:24:15.805 --> 02:24:16.205
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there is.

02:24:16.305 --> 02:24:17.986
[SPEAKER_07]: There's an X2 machine.

02:24:18.126 --> 02:24:18.667
[SPEAKER_06]: Right at the start.

02:24:18.947 --> 02:24:26.713
[SPEAKER_06]: They licensed the likeness from Konami, I'm sure, but that probably cost them a hell of a lot less than licensing Simon Belmont would have cost, you know?

02:24:27.333 --> 02:24:29.795
[SPEAKER_06]: So, they're smart.

02:24:32.758 --> 02:24:40.161
[SPEAKER_06]: Robert M in chat says, and technically yes, but what I was saying was hopefully Vanilla Girl and Sergeant Calhoun will be later characters.

02:24:40.561 --> 02:24:41.081
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well, yes.

02:24:41.602 --> 02:24:43.142
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope they are too.

02:24:43.242 --> 02:24:45.263
[SPEAKER_06]: Vanilla P von Schweetz, is that what you're talking about?

02:24:46.483 --> 02:24:50.885
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, she also made me think of Penelope Pitstop because the name was similar.

02:24:51.872 --> 02:24:52.813
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

02:25:11.126 --> 02:25:12.728
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that was a really good pick.

02:25:12.788 --> 02:25:15.750
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, all the voice actors were really good.

02:25:16.270 --> 02:25:19.973
[SPEAKER_06]: Jane Lynch especially was a great choice for that character.

02:25:20.453 --> 02:25:21.314
[SPEAKER_06]: She was perfect.

02:25:22.034 --> 02:25:25.096
[SPEAKER_06]: And the 30 Rock guy as Fix-It Felix.

02:25:25.517 --> 02:25:27.018
[SPEAKER_06]: They were all very great, great picks.

02:25:28.291 --> 02:25:32.032
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, since that's it for the emails, shame, shame.

02:25:32.072 --> 02:25:33.872
[SPEAKER_06]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:25:33.892 --> 02:25:35.613
[SPEAKER_06]: Send us more emails to read next week.

02:25:36.033 --> 02:25:40.814
[SPEAKER_02]: In the meantime... And don't tell us about, you know, inheriting money from some guy in England.

02:25:41.094 --> 02:25:45.855
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, or your, you know, pyramid scheme, or the French spam has to stop.

02:25:47.135 --> 02:25:47.995
[SPEAKER_06]: End French spam.

02:25:49.255 --> 02:25:49.555
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

02:25:50.216 --> 02:25:51.876
[SPEAKER_06]: Viva la French spam.

02:25:53.196 --> 02:25:56.637
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, speaking of things that make us angsty like French spam...

02:25:57.558 --> 02:25:58.492
[SPEAKER_06]: It's time for the FUs of the week.

02:26:14.787 --> 02:26:27.757
[SPEAKER_02]: My FUs are, first of all, to the end of my sinus infection, to Origin, well, actually specifically, the patch for Mass Effect 3 and EA's customer service.

02:26:28.517 --> 02:26:31.940
[SPEAKER_02]: It's keeping me from being able to play my game without restriction.

02:26:33.001 --> 02:26:36.403
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of it's not cool, but really I can't play it at all.

02:26:37.785 --> 02:26:39.786
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh...

02:26:41.407 --> 02:26:44.610
[SPEAKER_02]: I had another one, but I'm distracted by Raccoon Penis.

02:26:46.152 --> 02:26:46.572
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

02:26:47.633 --> 02:27:01.846
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess just F you to... I'll F you to this whole week because we're in the whole crux of the fourth quarter stuff, and unfortunately in the position of...

02:27:04.130 --> 02:27:05.191
[SPEAKER_07]: Distribution.

02:27:06.272 --> 02:27:19.541
[SPEAKER_07]: See, Distribution right now, it seems like they don't get Call of Duty Black Ops 2 early enough so the independent stores get theirs before midnight launch, which pisses off everybody and keeps having those people ask,

02:27:19.961 --> 02:27:23.062
[SPEAKER_07]: How am I supposed to stay in business and compete against games?

02:27:23.522 --> 02:27:26.203
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, listen, I'm not your fucking person that's supposed to tell you that.

02:27:26.223 --> 02:27:28.143
[SPEAKER_07]: If I told you that, I'd be running your store.

02:27:28.943 --> 02:27:30.124
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not running your store.

02:27:30.244 --> 02:27:31.984
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't get paid enough to run your store.

02:27:32.364 --> 02:27:40.747
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't go up to, you know, you don't own a restaurant and go to your butcher or whatever and go, why can't I compete with these other restaurant chains?

02:27:40.967 --> 02:27:41.727
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't make any sense.

02:27:42.407 --> 02:27:43.107
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's annoying.

02:27:43.328 --> 02:27:49.251
[SPEAKER_07]: And on top of all that, the rest of my co-workers, sales staff, get to go to Napa for a fun three-day weekend.

02:27:50.352 --> 02:27:58.116
[SPEAKER_07]: But because I landlocked the wife, I do not get to go to Napa.

02:27:58.636 --> 02:28:00.797
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that I was enjoying that because it's all wine tasting.

02:28:00.877 --> 02:28:02.257
[SPEAKER_07]: I fucking hate wine.

02:28:02.717 --> 02:28:03.337
[SPEAKER_07]: I like wine.

02:28:03.437 --> 02:28:04.337
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't like wine.

02:28:04.497 --> 02:28:06.138
[SPEAKER_07]: See, I was excited about it because I was like, sweet.

02:28:06.358 --> 02:28:08.598
[SPEAKER_07]: Second day is usually kind of that whole fun.

02:28:08.658 --> 02:28:10.399
[SPEAKER_07]: You get to go do whatever you want.

02:28:10.519 --> 02:28:11.979
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they have like activities planned out.

02:28:12.459 --> 02:28:15.000
[SPEAKER_07]: But now they only have one activity and that's wine tasting.

02:28:15.020 --> 02:28:16.940
[SPEAKER_07]: See, my activity would be fuck all the activities.

02:28:17.060 --> 02:28:20.981
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm driving to Menlo Park and I'm going to go to fucking Cusar.

02:28:22.261 --> 02:28:24.502
[SPEAKER_07]: But no, that's not going to happen.

02:28:24.562 --> 02:28:25.122
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's fine.

02:28:27.396 --> 02:28:28.877
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I don't know.

02:28:28.977 --> 02:28:32.498
[SPEAKER_06]: I have general angst this week, but not things I can really put into words.

02:28:32.578 --> 02:28:33.579
[SPEAKER_06]: Just stuff and things.

02:28:33.799 --> 02:28:37.320
[SPEAKER_06]: So, F you to stuff and things.

02:28:38.381 --> 02:28:39.141
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all you get.

02:28:40.642 --> 02:28:50.906
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, uh, let's move on to a few more quick news stories, and then we're gonna get to your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR and Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, on Skype.

02:28:50.966 --> 02:28:52.467
[SPEAKER_06]: But first, two more stories for you.

02:28:52.527 --> 02:28:52.747
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

02:28:52.967 --> 02:28:53.207
[SPEAKER_07]: FISHVILLE

02:29:13.513 --> 02:29:15.834
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, seriously, this whole Ville thing has got to stop.

02:29:15.874 --> 02:29:17.855
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it just sounds stupid.

02:29:18.416 --> 02:29:24.939
[SPEAKER_07]: But FishVille and Treasure Isle are the first two games that will be kind of going by.

02:29:25.580 --> 02:29:30.403
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're going to stop running on December 5th.

02:29:31.143 --> 02:29:36.986
[SPEAKER_07]: And I guess FishVille is a game where people fish?

02:29:38.387 --> 02:29:39.067
[SPEAKER_07]: Or are fish?

02:29:39.127 --> 02:29:40.088
[SPEAKER_07]: Imagine that!

02:29:40.168 --> 02:29:40.748
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, it's...

02:29:42.209 --> 02:29:43.470
[SPEAKER_07]: Who gives a fuck?

02:29:43.550 --> 02:29:44.191
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

02:29:44.251 --> 02:29:45.031
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I really don't.

02:29:48.554 --> 02:29:54.879
[SPEAKER_07]: But they do refer to their players as Fishvillers as this email from the Fishville team.

02:29:56.861 --> 02:29:57.061
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

02:29:58.894 --> 02:30:00.475
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, one more story for you guys.

02:30:00.655 --> 02:30:03.217
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's one for the classic OLR fans.

02:30:04.577 --> 02:30:06.839
[SPEAKER_06]: DDR Classroom Edition.

02:30:06.999 --> 02:30:09.820
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some extra information coming out about DDR Classroom Edition.

02:30:09.860 --> 02:30:15.043
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, that's kind of where DDR lives on now, is in PE programs in schools, which I think is great.

02:30:16.024 --> 02:30:18.645
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great way to get kids involved in Dance Dance Revolution.

02:30:19.006 --> 02:30:21.147
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the interesting thing about DDR Classroom Edition.

02:30:21.167 --> 02:30:23.768
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably better than any other version of the game.

02:30:25.049 --> 02:30:25.429
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

02:30:25.449 --> 02:30:25.669
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

02:30:48.877 --> 02:30:52.002
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently going to get new music updates every three to six months.

02:30:52.622 --> 02:30:59.772
[SPEAKER_06]: After some successful location tests in Southern California at some schools there, they're being very aggressive about the title.

02:30:59.852 --> 02:31:04.118
[SPEAKER_06]: Too bad it's something for schools and not for...

02:31:06.656 --> 02:31:08.057
[SPEAKER_06]: People to, like, actually get.

02:31:08.137 --> 02:31:19.564
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's the thing, though, is I think a lot of this stuff that they're probably licensing for the classroom edition is probably going to end up in Dance Dance Revolution, the fourth or fifth reboot of the franchise.

02:31:19.964 --> 02:31:20.805
[SPEAKER_06]: The new one coming out?

02:31:20.885 --> 02:31:23.426
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that'd be my guess, because they're doing too many licenses.

02:31:23.466 --> 02:31:29.050
[SPEAKER_07]: I doubt they would dump that much money into a classroom edition, which really doesn't need a diverse...

02:31:29.990 --> 02:31:35.974
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you think about it, do you really need a diverse soundtrack for the classroom edition?

02:31:36.974 --> 02:31:49.282
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I'm assuming most of this stuff is going to be picked by the teacher in the class and no one's going to go, oh my goodness, I really want to hear that song by the Screaming Masks or...

02:31:51.922 --> 02:31:54.364
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a pink song, So What?

02:31:54.524 --> 02:31:55.785
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard that song on the radio.

02:31:56.686 --> 02:32:03.032
[SPEAKER_06]: Natasha Bedingfield, Pocket Full of Sunshine, although I think, wasn't that in the DDR release on the most recent PlayStation?

02:32:03.192 --> 02:32:03.573
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

02:32:05.975 --> 02:32:10.179
[SPEAKER_06]: Chris Brown's song, you know, because they really should encourage his stuff in schools.

02:32:10.840 --> 02:32:11.140
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

02:32:13.243 --> 02:32:14.764
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a huge song list, though.

02:32:15.265 --> 02:32:17.427
[SPEAKER_06]: 397 songs looking at the PDF.

02:32:17.667 --> 02:32:18.968
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure it ain't cheap.

02:32:19.568 --> 02:32:26.854
[SPEAKER_07]: The question is, and thankfully they have this totally not sorted by artist, is Holic in the game?

02:32:28.876 --> 02:32:29.557
[SPEAKER_07]: Is Holic in there?

02:32:30.177 --> 02:32:31.098
[SPEAKER_07]: Holic is not in there.

02:32:31.118 --> 02:32:32.039
[SPEAKER_07]: At least I don't see it.

02:32:32.139 --> 02:32:33.340
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe future DLC.

02:32:34.140 --> 02:32:35.121
[SPEAKER_06]: Hot Limit, though, is.

02:32:36.722 --> 02:32:37.043
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.

02:32:38.140 --> 02:32:39.421
[SPEAKER_06]: You say Dramamine.

02:32:40.081 --> 02:32:40.401
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:32:41.142 --> 02:32:41.982
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to the phones.

02:32:42.002 --> 02:32:45.644
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or I use your name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio.

02:32:46.124 --> 02:32:48.566
[SPEAKER_06]: The phones are now open.

02:32:48.946 --> 02:32:49.686
[SPEAKER_06]: You can give us a call.

02:32:50.227 --> 02:32:54.409
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to go to the Twitter topics, but I got to grab my iPad.

02:32:54.809 --> 02:32:57.351
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, do you have any last minute stories?

02:32:58.071 --> 02:33:02.173
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I was just checking out some of the... Stop it.

02:33:02.714 --> 02:33:04.715
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just checking out some of the songs that are in here.

02:33:04.775 --> 02:33:06.816
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just seeing what they've got here and...

02:33:08.294 --> 02:33:09.295
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I was asleep.

02:33:10.277 --> 02:33:14.622
[SPEAKER_07]: They really don't have this in any sort of order.

02:33:15.323 --> 02:33:17.947
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to see if Holic is in here.

02:33:18.487 --> 02:33:19.729
[SPEAKER_02]: Holic is the best song ever.

02:33:20.169 --> 02:33:23.313
[SPEAKER_07]: They have Silent Hill, Thomas Howard for Christmas.

02:33:23.474 --> 02:33:23.954
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of cool.

02:33:26.590 --> 02:33:31.374
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that what happens in school now during the winter is like DDR time in PE?

02:33:31.394 --> 02:33:33.295
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I think that would be fucking awesome.

02:33:34.016 --> 02:33:39.640
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be really awesome to have that because it was what ultimate, it was like dodgeball or something like that.

02:33:40.441 --> 02:33:41.502
[SPEAKER_07]: What the hell did we used to do?

02:33:41.562 --> 02:33:42.763
[SPEAKER_07]: Play basketball maybe?

02:33:42.903 --> 02:33:43.823
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to do square dancing.

02:33:43.843 --> 02:33:44.764
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we used to do square dancing.

02:33:44.784 --> 02:33:45.765
[SPEAKER_06]: Square dancing was the best.

02:33:47.546 --> 02:33:47.987
[SPEAKER_06]: You're weird.

02:33:49.808 --> 02:33:51.630
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the one thing I was good at.

02:33:53.248 --> 02:33:54.168
[SPEAKER_03]: Grab your partner.

02:33:54.188 --> 02:33:55.349
[SPEAKER_06]: That and Pickleball.

02:33:55.509 --> 02:33:56.610
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you guys ever play Pickleball?

02:33:56.670 --> 02:33:56.910
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

02:33:57.350 --> 02:33:58.230
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the other thing.

02:33:58.250 --> 02:34:02.132
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like tennis, but kind of like dumbed down a little bit.

02:34:02.312 --> 02:34:05.274
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a game that we would play that was called Sink the Bismarck.

02:34:05.994 --> 02:34:06.254
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

02:34:07.152 --> 02:34:09.133
[SPEAKER_02]: After the ship from the World War.

02:34:10.814 --> 02:34:19.619
[SPEAKER_02]: But basically, you had two sides, and you had a few students in the middle, and they were the water mines.

02:34:20.399 --> 02:34:23.320
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the students were all the ships crossing the ocean.

02:34:24.201 --> 02:34:32.185
[SPEAKER_02]: And if one of the land mines managed to touch, or not land mines, but the water mines managed to touch one of the other students, then they became a mine, and they had to stop where they were.

02:34:32.725 --> 02:34:34.906
[SPEAKER_02]: And until the last one left was the winner.

02:34:35.787 --> 02:34:35.927
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

02:34:40.110 --> 02:34:42.092
[SPEAKER_06]: I just remember every Friday we had to run the mile.

02:34:43.733 --> 02:34:44.374
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

02:34:44.614 --> 02:34:49.098
[SPEAKER_06]: Going to Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR.

02:34:50.860 --> 02:34:52.381
[SPEAKER_06]: Thankfully, there's no let them move.

02:34:53.823 --> 02:34:55.384
[SPEAKER_06]: SSJ100 Matt linked us this story.

02:34:55.544 --> 02:35:00.969
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought this was in our show role, but I think it just might have not made this week.

02:35:01.030 --> 02:35:01.350
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

02:35:01.630 --> 02:35:04.113
[SPEAKER_06]: Take two is going to be opening a new Las Vegas office.

02:35:04.413 --> 02:35:04.574
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

02:35:04.594 --> 02:35:09.039
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was one of the stories you posted that we just didn't get to tonight because you talked to Grand Theft Auto somewhere else.

02:35:09.459 --> 02:35:13.984
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, 150 jobs in Las Vegas, a brand new downtown office.

02:35:14.405 --> 02:35:19.651
[SPEAKER_06]: Las Vegas Redevelopment Agency is offering up $600,000 in incentives to take two if they open the branch.

02:35:20.912 --> 02:35:43.966
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm telling you man Vegas is a pretty awesome you mean because everyone really thinks that Vegas is kind of like ooh casinos and stuff like that but it's actually a pretty cool suburb with like really cheap housing and it's not bad if like you're not into the whole casino thing it's still like a nice suburb I'm not sure if everybody who lives there would agree with you but let's go to the it seemed like a nice suburb I don't know hi you're on orange launch radio who's this

02:35:45.061 --> 02:35:46.964
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, a survivor of the hurricane, Ranma.

02:35:47.144 --> 02:35:49.006
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, so you came out okay, huh?

02:35:49.607 --> 02:35:50.488
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, pretty much.

02:35:50.928 --> 02:35:56.275
[SPEAKER_05]: One of our studios, aka Joe Vigdea, she lost power for a few days, but other than that, came out pretty good.

02:35:56.495 --> 02:36:00.080
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, a lot worse things could happen than losing power for a few days.

02:36:00.460 --> 02:36:01.241
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad to hear...

02:36:02.262 --> 02:36:09.588
[SPEAKER_06]: Places are recovering, you know, it's really tragic seeing a lot of the stuff that's happening along the New Jersey shore and all of that.

02:36:09.649 --> 02:36:20.898
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, all the jokes about reality TV aside, like, seeing that roller coaster just submerged in water is just, like, jaw on floor type of thing.

02:36:20.958 --> 02:36:24.581
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, it's upsetting, but, you know...

02:36:25.442 --> 02:36:43.390
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, I'm seeing the photos of the train station that's right by my house and the one view a little bit down the way, seeing all that water had me spazzing and then like on Wednesday when they started saying you can take the train, you can take some of the buses, me and a couple of friends went down to Coney Island to survey some of the damage.

02:36:43.730 --> 02:36:47.492
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the pictures, it didn't seem like it was that bad.

02:36:48.137 --> 02:36:48.897
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:37:05.523 --> 02:37:06.164
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for watching!

02:37:27.967 --> 02:37:32.351
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, pretty much, and now they're talking about another storm coming our way in about two days.

02:37:32.731 --> 02:37:33.372
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, goody.

02:37:33.872 --> 02:37:38.155
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's why you're supposed to fill your bathtub with water, have bleach, get canned food, buy all the bread.

02:37:39.016 --> 02:37:39.717
[SPEAKER_02]: Tape your windows.

02:37:41.378 --> 02:37:45.461
[SPEAKER_05]: I did all of that, and we had a big ol' bucket of hurricane to drink.

02:37:48.124 --> 02:37:50.666
[SPEAKER_02]: But I will tell you, welcome to my childhood.

02:37:51.226 --> 02:37:54.529
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma, I'm sure you didn't just call in to talk about the storm, but thank you for the update.

02:37:55.089 --> 02:37:55.830
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind tonight?

02:37:57.343 --> 02:38:03.669
[SPEAKER_05]: My issues with Xbox and banning people for names and insults and stuff.

02:38:03.969 --> 02:38:06.832
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I kind of see both points on this.

02:38:07.172 --> 02:38:17.001
[SPEAKER_05]: It just feels like this is no different from being in high school and you're being bullied and you're hearing N-word, F-word, K-word, all this stuff.

02:38:17.262 --> 02:38:20.064
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, if you run your mouth, if you go...

02:38:22.725 --> 02:38:23.505
[SPEAKER_05]: Go report it.

02:38:23.565 --> 02:38:24.126
[SPEAKER_05]: This happens.

02:38:24.166 --> 02:38:24.706
[SPEAKER_05]: That happens.

02:38:25.226 --> 02:38:31.929
[SPEAKER_05]: In a way, I kind of feel like just let them handle their own business.

02:38:32.589 --> 02:38:41.132
[SPEAKER_05]: But on the same token, if it's just a bunch of friends running their mouth having a good time, you have that one person coming in, starting to freak out, and then all hell breaks loose.

02:38:41.353 --> 02:38:44.414
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but if you're going to play with your friends, why would you let that one person in anyway?

02:38:45.254 --> 02:39:06.507
[SPEAKER_05]: Because, you know, it's always in that, in the group, it's like, you always bring that one person, like, oh, don't worry, he's cool, he's understandable, she's cool, she's understandable, and then you're like, and you find out later, oh, shit Or, back in the day when we'd do PSO and only three of us were online and we wanted a fourth to do the full challenge, we would just go to Open Lobby, the three of us, and pull another person

02:39:06.974 --> 02:39:07.334
[SPEAKER_06]: XBOX 360 XBOX 360

02:39:24.802 --> 02:39:30.425
[SPEAKER_06]: So like, you know, like Shane and I might be playing Mass Effect and maybe we have, you know, Acidic Vampire, Osfer, somebody with us.

02:39:30.745 --> 02:39:37.048
[SPEAKER_06]: So like the three of us will be in the party chat and then we'll bring in a random fourth, but they can't hear us because we're in the party chat.

02:39:37.509 --> 02:39:37.989
[SPEAKER_06]: That's good.

02:39:38.109 --> 02:39:39.750
[SPEAKER_06]: And that dialogue doesn't go out in game.

02:39:39.810 --> 02:39:42.691
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, we have to remember the Xbox does have that infrastructure set up.

02:39:43.011 --> 02:39:49.715
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you do want to bring in randoms to fill out your party, you know, you can still have your closed conversation without worrying about offending some stranger.

02:39:49.735 --> 02:39:49.815
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

02:39:51.687 --> 02:39:52.127
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.

02:39:52.588 --> 02:39:54.089
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so that's a solution.

02:39:54.149 --> 02:39:58.493
[SPEAKER_06]: But I still get what you're saying, you know, where you don't want that one person.

02:39:58.513 --> 02:40:08.721
[SPEAKER_06]: Because still, you could be bringing somebody into your little party chat that maybe you kind of didn't estimate correctly and maybe will take offense.

02:40:09.142 --> 02:40:19.891
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think, I don't know, I guess Microsoft to some extent maybe has a responsibility to not regulate private games the same way they would regulate a public game.

02:40:21.332 --> 02:40:22.273
[SPEAKER_06]: That works for me Yep

02:40:36.275 --> 02:40:43.001
[SPEAKER_06]: although some would argue it's toxic to use those words in any circumstance, but that's a debate for another time, I suppose.

02:40:43.101 --> 02:40:45.483
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, definitely.

02:40:46.043 --> 02:40:48.185
[SPEAKER_06]: So, gosh, anything else on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:40:49.086 --> 02:40:51.407
[SPEAKER_06]: A friend of mine did a voice in Wreck-It Ralph.

02:40:52.068 --> 02:40:52.588
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, really?

02:40:52.729 --> 02:40:53.229
[SPEAKER_06]: What voice?

02:40:53.269 --> 02:40:53.569
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know?

02:40:54.410 --> 02:40:55.111
[SPEAKER_06]: He was Ryu.

02:40:56.271 --> 02:40:57.292
[SPEAKER_06]: Get out!

02:40:57.833 --> 02:40:58.814
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.

02:41:00.915 --> 02:41:03.117
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a quick scene, but it was funny.

02:41:03.457 --> 02:41:04.158
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody laughed.

02:41:05.558 --> 02:41:06.258
[SPEAKER_05]: So will the Wii U launch?

02:41:31.434 --> 02:41:42.283
[SPEAKER_06]: We need stories from the Wii U launch I don't know what's going on here Everything about this launch is very mysterious to me It seems like it's all done in pre-orders Are people even camping out?

02:41:42.343 --> 02:41:43.364
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that a thing anymore?

02:41:44.125 --> 02:41:45.406
[SPEAKER_06]: People are camping

02:41:46.755 --> 02:41:52.099
[SPEAKER_05]: My younger brother, Greg, upon hearing about the preords and all of this, he sends me a message.

02:41:52.860 --> 02:41:56.002
[SPEAKER_05]: You are coming with me to camp out for the Wii U, right?

02:41:56.703 --> 02:41:57.424
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess.

02:41:57.764 --> 02:41:59.165
[SPEAKER_05]: You are coming, right?

02:41:59.345 --> 02:42:00.906
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I will be there.

02:42:01.147 --> 02:42:02.147
[SPEAKER_05]: Just save me some soup.

02:42:03.068 --> 02:42:04.089
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to camp out.

02:42:04.129 --> 02:42:06.491
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to go on Amazon and have them ship it.

02:42:06.511 --> 02:42:07.672
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just lazy.

02:42:08.610 --> 02:42:10.052
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm too old to camp out.

02:42:10.813 --> 02:42:11.715
[SPEAKER_06]: You haven't ordered it yet?

02:42:12.937 --> 02:42:14.519
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care and I don't want one.

02:42:15.641 --> 02:42:17.964
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hoping I have connections that can help me get one.

02:42:18.525 --> 02:42:19.927
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I plan on getting one.

02:42:20.007 --> 02:42:21.209
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

02:42:21.229 --> 02:42:22.351
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you have to let us know how it is.

02:42:22.910 --> 02:42:23.650
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, by the way.

02:42:23.670 --> 02:42:25.591
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just buying this.

02:42:25.631 --> 02:42:28.611
[SPEAKER_05]: I can just put it on eBay.

02:42:28.731 --> 02:42:30.152
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing real quick about Wreck-It Ralph.

02:42:31.172 --> 02:42:35.153
[SPEAKER_02]: The little film at the very beginning of it will give you sniffles.

02:42:35.773 --> 02:42:35.953
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.

02:42:35.973 --> 02:42:37.573
[SPEAKER_06]: It was so Paper Man.

02:42:37.893 --> 02:42:39.934
[SPEAKER_06]: The little short, because that's like a thing now.

02:42:39.974 --> 02:42:43.514
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of Pixar movies and Disney, even Disney classics, have these shorts in front of them.

02:42:43.534 --> 02:42:44.074
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was really good.

02:42:44.094 --> 02:42:46.355
[SPEAKER_02]: It was called Paper Man, and it was really sweet.

02:42:46.575 --> 02:42:46.955
[SPEAKER_02]: It was cute.

02:42:46.975 --> 02:42:47.815
[SPEAKER_06]: It was cute.

02:42:48.355 --> 02:42:48.575
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

02:42:48.595 --> 02:42:51.916
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm referring Paper Man to Slender Man, albeit from me.

02:42:52.580 --> 02:42:54.843
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well Ranma, we're gonna let you go so we can get some more calls, okay?

02:42:55.344 --> 02:42:55.864
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, cool.

02:42:55.964 --> 02:42:56.525
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, bye!

02:42:59.266 --> 02:43:04.590
[SPEAKER_06]: Always nice to hear from Ranma, one of the hosts of Anime Jam Session, Tuesdays on the Voice of Geeks Network.

02:43:04.990 --> 02:43:09.453
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I didn't mention this during the show, but some of you probably picked up on this.

02:43:09.933 --> 02:43:13.596
[SPEAKER_06]: Our feed was down for like four days this week.

02:43:13.776 --> 02:43:14.776
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty crazy.

02:43:15.477 --> 02:43:18.159
[SPEAKER_06]: So some of our programming got rolled over to next week.

02:43:18.559 --> 02:43:24.703
[SPEAKER_06]: Critical Myth will be back next week with some of the episodes that got missed due to the outage.

02:43:25.123 --> 02:43:29.026
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the Warcraft shows, unfortunately, they're just going to have to be missed.

02:43:29.963 --> 02:43:32.305
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, we got another call coming in, so let's go to the phones.

02:43:32.365 --> 02:43:33.306
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:43:33.326 --> 02:43:33.666
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's this?

02:43:34.807 --> 02:43:35.227
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, guys.

02:43:35.268 --> 02:43:36.889
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the one and only Degenerate Johnny.

02:43:37.029 --> 02:43:37.569
[SPEAKER_00]: How you guys doing?

02:43:37.870 --> 02:43:39.111
[SPEAKER_06]: What is up, Degenerate Johnny?

02:43:39.151 --> 02:43:41.213
[SPEAKER_06]: You wrote that comment on Facebook earlier, right?

02:43:41.773 --> 02:43:42.233
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I did.

02:43:42.353 --> 02:43:44.475
[SPEAKER_00]: I called in to follow up on that.

02:43:44.615 --> 02:43:45.076
[SPEAKER_00]: Please do.

02:43:46.667 --> 02:43:59.980
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so basically, it seems to me that gaming in the culture that we live today, it still hasn't really gotten it through these people's heads.

02:44:00.020 --> 02:44:01.942
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, look back a few years back.

02:44:03.563 --> 02:44:04.324
[SPEAKER_00]: Fox News.

02:44:05.004 --> 02:44:10.126
[SPEAKER_00]: I geeked out when Fox News was saying, oh yeah, we're going to talk about Mass Effect.

02:44:10.146 --> 02:44:11.627
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, oh my goodness!

02:44:12.167 --> 02:44:16.509
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was nothing but a bash fest over that 30 second love scene.

02:44:16.549 --> 02:44:19.830
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, what the hell is this crap?

02:44:20.110 --> 02:44:24.212
[SPEAKER_06]: Of which there is much worse stuff shown on Fox Television.

02:44:25.013 --> 02:44:25.513
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

02:44:25.533 --> 02:44:25.893
[SPEAKER_06]: Glee and shit.

02:44:29.841 --> 02:44:30.982
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's it.

02:44:31.282 --> 02:44:35.445
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just saying Glee and House and all those shows have far worse content.

02:44:36.245 --> 02:44:36.946
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, exactly.

02:44:36.986 --> 02:44:48.113
[SPEAKER_00]: And even their quote-unquote expert, Cooper Lawrence, said herself that she saw sayings in Lost that were actually more explicit than that love scene.

02:44:50.154 --> 02:44:55.778
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it seems amazing to me that, you know,

02:44:56.750 --> 02:44:59.032
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing has evolved ever since, you know, 1993.

02:45:00.013 --> 02:45:04.736
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where I think the gaming industry has evolved.

02:45:06.057 --> 02:45:16.265
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the moment that Congress approached the Electronic Software Association after Mortal Kombat and Doom and saying, hey, you know what, we appreciate, you know,

02:45:16.912 --> 02:45:17.372
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura.com

02:45:38.924 --> 02:45:41.806
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let me throw this out there, just to be devil's advocate.

02:45:41.826 --> 02:45:45.428
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that I disagree with you, but I want to throw this thought out here and see what you think about this.

02:45:45.789 --> 02:45:54.935
[SPEAKER_06]: Because 20 years ago, which, you know, 93 was almost 20 years ago at this point, another industry that faced a lot of battles in Congress was the music industry.

02:45:55.495 --> 02:45:59.337
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is because gangster rap started to take a storm a little bit.

02:45:59.678 --> 02:46:05.361
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is where that whole little black and white sticker that says parental advisory, caution, explicit lyrics came from.

02:46:05.541 --> 02:46:08.023
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of this is perpetuated by the same person between the two.

02:46:08.483 --> 02:46:09.384
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, hilarious, right?

02:46:09.744 --> 02:46:23.374
[SPEAKER_06]: But where it came from regardless, music doesn't get that same, pardon the pun, rap that video games does in being accepted in mainstream culture.

02:46:23.454 --> 02:46:28.798
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I guess one could argue there's still a lot of people that say gangster rap's not music.

02:46:29.158 --> 02:46:29.819
[SPEAKER_06]: It's garbage.

02:46:31.039 --> 02:46:34.122
[SPEAKER_06]: There's people out there that feel that way, whether they're right or wrong.

02:46:34.742 --> 02:47:00.617
[SPEAKER_00]: so I you know it's it's just interesting to me that you know music fought a lot of that stuff in the 90s too yet music I mean it fought it fought against that bell you know way before then I mean hell the Beatles were considered the devil's music that's right play the records backwards remember yeah I was like how am I working with the devil when I'm hearing I want to hold your hand what the hell

02:47:01.878 --> 02:47:08.301
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's you wanting to hold the devil's hand as you walk through the lakes of fire and fiery hell.

02:47:09.321 --> 02:47:11.682
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, dear lord, lordy, oh my goodness.

02:47:12.343 --> 02:47:16.705
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, it just astounds me.

02:47:16.885 --> 02:47:28.930
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, to follow up on what I also said is that, you know, I do agree with you that entertainment today actually requires, you know, you know,

02:47:29.318 --> 02:47:31.239
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for watching!

02:47:53.144 --> 02:48:03.940
[SPEAKER_00]: and so I've been actually studying up on this and seeing how all these forms of entertainment obviously still some entertainments you know

02:48:04.972 --> 02:48:11.894
[SPEAKER_00]: are a little, you know, they cling to their old ways, you know, tradition, which I do respect.

02:48:11.934 --> 02:48:31.039
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there are obviously plays and playwrights and it, you know, as a matter of fact, you know, what you and Jessica Harper recently did with the Rocky Horror, you know, I mean, that is a, you know, a form of evolution from, you know, the plays and playwrights and, you know, it's becoming, you know,

02:48:33.047 --> 02:48:38.889
[SPEAKER_06]: It's funny you bring that up because that in particular is something... I actually was at Rocky Horror last night.

02:48:38.909 --> 02:48:40.530
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I got home at 5 in the morning.

02:48:40.710 --> 02:48:45.072
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I was with one of the Bay Area cast who was celebrating their 17th birthday as a cast.

02:48:45.532 --> 02:48:50.554
[SPEAKER_06]: Rocky Horror is something that's been around for 35 years.

02:48:51.094 --> 02:48:54.676
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is interesting you talk about it... God, I could fill another show with this.

02:48:55.076 --> 02:48:56.477
[SPEAKER_06]: You just set me on a tangent.

02:48:57.017 --> 02:49:05.861
[SPEAKER_06]: It is interesting that that whole stuff could be considered another art form because there's other movies now that, you know, people want to kind of shadow cast and bring to that.

02:49:06.262 --> 02:49:10.924
[SPEAKER_06]: And especially with the group I've been working with here in Sacramento, they really have made an art out of it.

02:49:10.964 --> 02:49:15.486
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I know I'm talking up, but you've got to see the way they do Repo the Genetic Opera.

02:49:15.966 --> 02:49:19.568
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, like, that movie, for all practical purposes, is kind of stupid.

02:49:20.168 --> 02:49:22.710
[SPEAKER_06]: But when you see the stage show of it, you're like...

02:49:23.658 --> 02:49:25.540
[SPEAKER_06]: is this shit for real?

02:49:25.640 --> 02:49:48.497
[SPEAKER_06]: this is crazy I mean words can only can't even describe it it's the atmosphere and now they're talking about doing it for and I don't know how much I'm supposed to say on my little radio show or not but now they're talking about doing it for The Room and there was talk about doing Scott Pilgrim vs. The World at one point they've had to put that on hold I think it's a rights thing but that was like gonna be a thing so

02:49:49.346 --> 02:49:55.513
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Jessica said something last night on Under Sedation Live that she was actually going to be doing something that involves a room.

02:49:55.673 --> 02:50:01.460
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I have mixed feelings about the room, but anyway, we'll leave that to another show.

02:50:02.461 --> 02:50:04.842
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, but let me go back to video games with this.

02:50:04.922 --> 02:50:07.663
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to ask you about this so we can wrap up.

02:50:08.703 --> 02:50:21.287
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you did kind of make the comment on Facebook, let me ask you, what would you like to see happen next with the video game movie working hand in hand together in this fusion?

02:50:21.327 --> 02:50:23.287
[SPEAKER_06]: What would you like to see happen next with that?

02:50:23.627 --> 02:50:26.148
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, do you think we need to stop obsessing about it?

02:50:27.583 --> 02:50:38.640
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I think we need to stop obsessing on it because, you know, you look at the past, the two industries never really, you know, you know,

02:50:39.209 --> 02:50:45.813
[SPEAKER_00]: They never really generate a form of something that's really successful.

02:50:58.321 --> 02:50:59.562
[SPEAKER_00]: being based off of a game.

02:50:59.742 --> 02:51:01.782
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see Oscar winning award games.

02:51:01.842 --> 02:51:08.245
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know we all want to see Mass Effect on the big screen and we want to see Warcraft on the big screen.

02:51:08.605 --> 02:51:11.786
[SPEAKER_06]: But in reality, I think we just... Those movies are going to suck.

02:51:12.607 --> 02:51:17.328
[SPEAKER_06]: If you are a fan of those games, there is no possible way those movies are going to satisfy you.

02:51:17.729 --> 02:51:21.010
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think I really do see your point here because there is no...

02:51:21.630 --> 02:51:29.633
[SPEAKER_06]: Possible way, no possible way you can adapt the Mass Effect games into a movie and leave people satisfied.

02:51:29.953 --> 02:51:31.854
[SPEAKER_06]: They will be pissed.

02:51:32.094 --> 02:51:36.456
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like Harry Potter fans always are mad that the books aren't adapted correctly.

02:51:36.956 --> 02:51:41.821
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure somebody's got a problem with Lord of the Rings, although to be fair, they do it okay.

02:51:42.822 --> 02:51:44.964
[SPEAKER_06]: Mass Effect is a video game.

02:51:45.045 --> 02:51:46.406
[SPEAKER_06]: It is not going to work as a movie.

02:51:46.646 --> 02:51:48.288
[SPEAKER_06]: But here's why Wreck-It Ralph worked.

02:51:48.668 --> 02:51:50.350
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Wreck-It Ralph wasn't a game.

02:51:50.730 --> 02:51:53.293
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a movie about gaming culture.

02:51:54.175 --> 02:51:54.735
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

02:51:55.895 --> 02:52:21.162
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why Hope is viewed as a story that involves the characters that we all love to play with, but I just hope it doesn't go past that and still is conceived as what video games are today, as a child's toy, because we have progressed so much beyond that point.

02:52:22.461 --> 02:52:27.774
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well Degenerate Johnny, I gotta let you go so we can see if we can get another call and wrap up the show, but great phone call.

02:52:27.814 --> 02:52:28.475
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't be a stranger.

02:52:29.618 --> 02:52:30.199
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, take care.

02:52:30.760 --> 02:52:30.921
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

02:52:32.611 --> 02:52:33.291
[SPEAKER_06]: Really good points.

02:52:34.212 --> 02:52:38.393
[SPEAKER_06]: He hasn't called into the show an awful lot, but I like some of the points he was raising there.

02:52:38.453 --> 02:52:40.093
[SPEAKER_06]: So definitely worth talking to.

02:52:40.113 --> 02:52:40.734
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.

02:52:41.654 --> 02:52:44.135
[SPEAKER_06]: We are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:52:44.155 --> 02:52:45.015
[SPEAKER_06]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:52:45.135 --> 02:52:47.076
[SPEAKER_06]: Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:52:47.396 --> 02:52:49.977
[SPEAKER_06]: If we can get another call in here real quick, we'll take it.

02:52:50.377 --> 02:52:52.437
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, we might just wrap up for the night.

02:52:52.938 --> 02:52:57.199
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me go to Twitter, though, because I still had some more of these tweets I wanted to get to.

02:52:57.779 --> 02:53:02.421
[SPEAKER_06]: Including one from Tiger Claw that talks about the Halo 4 Amex card thing.

02:53:03.201 --> 02:53:10.164
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember reading a little bit about this, but, you know, I don't have an American Express myself, so I just kind of scrolled on by.

02:53:10.684 --> 02:53:22.008
[SPEAKER_06]: But apparently there is a partnership between Microsoft and American Express so that if you are a cardholder, you get coupons and credits for tying your account to Xbox Live and playing Halo 4.

02:53:24.025 --> 02:53:25.206
[SPEAKER_06]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:53:42.856 --> 02:53:48.740
[SPEAKER_06]: If you complete the single player campaign on normal or harder difficulty, you get a $25 statement credit.

02:53:49.280 --> 02:53:52.522
[SPEAKER_06]: If you are one of the first 25 people in the U.S.

02:53:53.383 --> 02:54:03.329
[SPEAKER_06]: to complete the campaign alone on legendary difficulty, you will be entered to win a trip to the 2013 Electronic Entertainment Expo.

02:54:03.349 --> 02:54:05.171
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's not irritating or anything.

02:54:05.811 --> 02:54:13.012
[SPEAKER_06]: because E3 is a very exclusive thing to be able to get into, but apparently you can win your way in through Amex.

02:54:14.533 --> 02:54:17.453
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad that the integrity is being kept up.

02:54:17.493 --> 02:54:31.876
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I'm so glad that we're keeping the independent press out of the events for the nasty, filthy things they'll say about it on the internet, yet we're going to let a contest winner from American Express get their way into the show.

02:54:32.556 --> 02:54:33.276
[SPEAKER_06]: I see how it is.

02:54:35.273 --> 02:54:35.874
[SPEAKER_06]: Is DRM going too far?

02:54:49.950 --> 02:54:51.451
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I'm reading the story here real quick.

02:54:51.471 --> 02:54:51.992
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me look at this.

02:54:53.613 --> 02:54:55.974
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a forum post, okay?

02:54:56.755 --> 02:54:59.276
[SPEAKER_06]: He links us to a forum post on overclock.net.

02:54:59.697 --> 02:55:05.461
[SPEAKER_06]: Razer Synapse 2.0 software mouse unusable if you don't have an internet connection.

02:55:06.121 --> 02:55:15.848
[SPEAKER_06]: ThePoster, who goes by ChannelX99, just bought a new Naga 2012 mouse, installed the software, and got greeted by a login screen right after.

02:55:16.288 --> 02:55:22.532
[SPEAKER_06]: No option to bypass it to use the software to configure the mouse, set the options, sensitivity, shortcuts, macros, etc.

02:55:22.892 --> 02:55:24.774
[SPEAKER_06]: So I create an account and try to log in.

02:55:25.034 --> 02:55:25.394
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing.

02:55:25.754 --> 02:55:26.875
[SPEAKER_06]: Try several more times.

02:55:27.315 --> 02:55:27.676
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing.

02:55:27.996 --> 02:55:29.057
[SPEAKER_06]: Try to make new accounts.

02:55:29.137 --> 02:55:30.678
[SPEAKER_06]: Different email addresses won't work.

02:55:31.158 --> 02:55:36.402
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a stupid That's completely awful I would be writing a letter to the Better Business Bureau Which I'm about to be doing for Origin

02:55:59.373 --> 02:56:03.736
[SPEAKER_07]: DR, you can't... Do they sell counterfeit mice?

02:56:03.876 --> 02:56:05.678
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, is that a thing?

02:56:05.958 --> 02:56:10.641
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to get political, but I'm honest to God, this is the first thought that jumps into my mind.

02:56:11.021 --> 02:56:14.904
[SPEAKER_06]: There's this very controversial proposition on the ballot in California.

02:56:14.944 --> 02:56:19.367
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Prop 37, and it has to do with labeling certain types of food.

02:56:19.887 --> 02:56:23.190
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to get into where I'm leaning on this proposition or whatever.

02:56:23.230 --> 02:56:33.078
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to say if it passes, there's going to be additional warning labels on food and restrictions on what can be called a natural food or not.

02:56:34.399 --> 02:56:38.623
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason why I bring that up, that mouse ought to carry a fucking sticker on it.

02:56:38.903 --> 02:56:39.604
[SPEAKER_06]: Bright and big.

02:56:39.904 --> 02:56:45.929
[SPEAKER_06]: Will not work without an interconnect connection because you, the buyer, have the right to know that shit before you buy it.

02:56:47.372 --> 02:56:48.793
[SPEAKER_07]: Take the mouse back, buddy.

02:57:04.127 --> 02:57:04.548
[SPEAKER_06]: and DarkSakura.

02:57:25.611 --> 02:57:30.314
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate to sound stupid and I might by saying this but I don't care.

02:57:30.654 --> 02:57:40.361
[SPEAKER_06]: Shouldn't there be like antitrust shit involved because you're forcing somebody to log up for your crap because you bought this particular product at the store.

02:57:41.342 --> 02:57:49.788
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like you're making somebody sign up for this other service because of your foothold in the mouse keyboard.

02:57:50.488 --> 02:57:52.590
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't there a questionable legality to that?

02:57:54.045 --> 02:57:59.153
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, maybe because we're talking about a mice and keyboard company that's kind of a niche market at gamers.

02:57:59.173 --> 02:58:01.177
[SPEAKER_06]: They do have their $2,500 laptop that's coming out this week as well.

02:58:01.197 --> 02:58:01.277
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

02:58:08.466 --> 02:58:08.787
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

02:58:08.847 --> 02:58:11.129
[SPEAKER_06]: Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

02:58:11.730 --> 02:58:15.915
[SPEAKER_06]: Tiger Klaus says, the only thing I'm doing with the mouse or keyboard is turning the LEDs on or off.

02:58:16.275 --> 02:58:19.178
[SPEAKER_06]: So when I go to bed, I just load up the software to turn them off.

02:58:19.539 --> 02:58:23.804
[SPEAKER_06]: All other features it has, I don't use because that's mostly features associated to gaming.

02:58:25.565 --> 02:58:28.849
[SPEAKER_06]: One more tweet from Actdeft who says, Fairy Solitaire.

02:58:29.910 --> 02:58:32.671
[SPEAKER_06]: is free to download on Steam for a few days.

02:58:33.951 --> 02:58:34.572
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knew that?

02:58:35.372 --> 02:58:36.832
[SPEAKER_06]: Get it now, keep it forever.

02:58:37.312 --> 02:58:51.437
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want the addicting card game Fairy Solitaire where you find and raise a fairy pet and repopulate the magical land of Avalon using the resources found by clearing each level, sounds like you can get that on Steam for free right now.

02:58:52.197 --> 02:58:57.724
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, you should, even if you're not really that interested in it, if you're mildly interested, because, hey, it's free.

02:58:58.325 --> 02:59:00.267
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I'm giggling there, but you know what?

02:59:00.688 --> 02:59:02.109
[SPEAKER_06]: Props to them making it free.

02:59:04.332 --> 02:59:05.634
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure it's better than Yaris.

02:59:08.217 --> 02:59:11.481
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a very low bar to exceed there.

02:59:13.436 --> 02:59:19.946
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, that's going to do it for our Twitter topic tonight and the other interactive parts of our show.

02:59:21.188 --> 02:59:22.790
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to close up shop.

02:59:24.907 --> 02:59:26.729
[SPEAKER_06]: And did Skype just, like, freeze my computer?

02:59:27.950 --> 02:59:28.750
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Skype.

02:59:28.891 --> 02:59:30.972
[SPEAKER_06]: You dropped the live listeners and everything.

02:59:30.992 --> 02:59:32.233
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, that was Skype's fault.

02:59:32.293 --> 02:59:33.655
[SPEAKER_06]: That was not Comcast's fault.

02:59:33.675 --> 02:59:34.575
[SPEAKER_06]: That was Skype's fault.

02:59:35.216 --> 02:59:36.437
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry for the stream drop there.

02:59:37.458 --> 02:59:41.701
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, anyhow, that's going to do it for telephone calls and Twitter and all that good stuff.

02:59:42.022 --> 02:59:43.643
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's end the show.

02:59:43.703 --> 02:59:45.645
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any other last-minute stories either, you guys?

02:59:45.705 --> 02:59:46.445
[SPEAKER_02]: I have something to say.

02:59:46.685 --> 02:59:47.046
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, what?

02:59:47.186 --> 02:59:50.208
[SPEAKER_02]: Tomorrow is my mom's birthday, so happy birthday, Mom, even though you don't listen.

02:59:50.489 --> 02:59:52.871
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy birthday to DarkSakura's mom, even though she doesn't listen.

02:59:53.091 --> 02:59:53.191
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

02:59:54.318 --> 02:59:55.700
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, any last minute stories or anything?

02:59:56.360 --> 02:59:57.362
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about a slow news week.

02:59:57.382 --> 02:59:58.283
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have anything.

02:59:58.643 --> 03:00:00.906
[SPEAKER_06]: MXC in chat says, don't knock it.

03:00:01.006 --> 03:00:04.590
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried playing Fairy Solitaire on a whim and can't stop playing.

03:00:04.650 --> 03:00:05.992
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been three hours.

03:00:08.835 --> 03:00:10.197
[SPEAKER_02]: I have another thing to say.

03:00:10.337 --> 03:00:10.457
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

03:00:10.637 --> 03:00:11.378
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll say it for last.

03:00:12.119 --> 03:00:13.140
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to quickly say this.

03:00:13.420 --> 03:00:20.705
[SPEAKER_06]: Shane, if you're listening and you're in chat, will you link the listeners that game you were talking to me earlier on Warcraft about?

03:00:21.205 --> 03:00:22.206
[SPEAKER_06]: It was hilarious.

03:00:22.246 --> 03:00:23.947
[SPEAKER_06]: I wish he'd called in to talk about it.

03:00:24.007 --> 03:00:25.408
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounded hilarious.

03:00:25.868 --> 03:00:30.452
[SPEAKER_06]: You start playing the game and it looks like an edutainment title that's about fractions.

03:00:30.832 --> 03:00:36.656
[SPEAKER_06]: But then he was talking about how it gets weirder and weirder and weirder.

03:00:37.256 --> 03:00:45.301
[SPEAKER_06]: and weirder and suddenly you're at the top of this government conspiracy and it turns into a text adventure game.

03:00:46.102 --> 03:00:50.425
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried playing it for 30 seconds and I'm like, I don't get the joke.

03:00:50.525 --> 03:00:51.506
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a stupid game.

03:00:51.606 --> 03:00:52.286
[SPEAKER_06]: Close window.

03:00:52.586 --> 03:00:56.629
[SPEAKER_06]: But then he was telling me about it on Vent and I was laughing because it sounded really ridiculous.

03:00:56.869 --> 03:01:03.774
[SPEAKER_06]: So if he's not listening, I'll get the link from him and we can talk about it next week because Loki, I think you of all of us should probably play this game.

03:01:03.814 --> 03:01:04.935
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like something you'd get a kick out of.

03:01:04.955 --> 03:01:05.475
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds awesome.

03:01:05.595 --> 03:01:06.976
[SPEAKER_06]: You like flash games that are weird.

03:01:07.758 --> 03:01:15.438
[SPEAKER_06]: all right um okay let's go around and get everybody's final thought Jamie you had something in mind already so I'll start with you tonight your final thought I'm gonna wreck it

03:01:17.784 --> 03:01:20.445
[SPEAKER_06]: My final thought tonight is Baked Potato.

03:01:21.205 --> 03:01:22.166
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, your final thought tonight.

03:01:23.726 --> 03:01:24.467
[SPEAKER_07]: Mob Arena.

03:01:24.607 --> 03:01:26.107
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully they'll be coming soon.

03:01:26.487 --> 03:01:29.849
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, check out the map that we have for the VOG server.

03:01:29.889 --> 03:01:31.609
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're not part of it, you should join.

03:01:32.630 --> 03:01:34.410
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fun, and you get to build stuff.

03:01:34.450 --> 03:01:40.092
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you want to check out the map, vogmc.co.cc, and you can check out what we're building.

03:01:40.853 --> 03:01:41.193
[SPEAKER_07]: Peek in.

03:01:42.613 --> 03:01:44.776
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

03:01:44.836 --> 03:01:50.461
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys so much for downloading our show or listening to us live, however you choose to participate with Orange Lounge Radio.

[SPEAKER_06]: We really appreciate it.

03:01:51.602 --> 03:01:53.864
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know we've said this a lot, but it is true.

03:01:54.205 --> 03:01:55.366
[SPEAKER_06]: We're an independent show.

03:01:55.666 --> 03:01:56.847
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't ask for anything.

03:01:57.208 --> 03:01:59.290
[SPEAKER_06]: Please just tell a friend or two.

03:01:59.330 --> 03:02:00.251
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess this is something.

03:02:00.271 --> 03:02:01.772
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we don't ask for money and stuff, but...

03:02:02.953 --> 03:02:03.613
[SPEAKER_02]: I like money, though.

03:02:03.634 --> 03:02:04.474
[SPEAKER_02]: You could just give it to me.

03:02:04.914 --> 03:02:07.696
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell a friend or two or five about the show.

03:02:08.036 --> 03:02:09.197
[SPEAKER_06]: Help spread the word.

03:02:09.557 --> 03:02:14.820
[SPEAKER_06]: The voting in the podcast towards we talked about earlier, that's a great way to do that, but there's other ways to spread the word, too.

03:02:15.180 --> 03:02:15.861
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell a friend.

03:02:16.161 --> 03:02:17.522
[SPEAKER_06]: Give us a nice review somewhere.

03:02:17.782 --> 03:02:19.383
[SPEAKER_06]: Help spread the word of Orange Lounge Radio.

03:02:19.403 --> 03:02:21.064
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get some other voices in the community.

03:02:21.104 --> 03:02:24.406
[SPEAKER_06]: We had some great discussion tonight on a lot of different topics.

03:02:24.426 --> 03:02:25.126
[SPEAKER_06]: This was a good show.

03:02:25.166 --> 03:02:26.627
[SPEAKER_02]: This was a very grown-up show, Ryan.

03:02:26.647 --> 03:02:28.727
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a very grown-up show, so we need some more voices.

03:02:28.747 --> 03:02:30.708
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a special episode of Orange Lounge Radio.

03:02:30.728 --> 03:02:31.008
[SPEAKER_06]: It was.

03:02:31.048 --> 03:02:32.028
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a very special one.

03:02:32.068 --> 03:02:33.368
[SPEAKER_06]: Vote or P. Diddy will kill you.

03:02:33.428 --> 03:02:33.848
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

03:02:33.928 --> 03:02:35.929
[SPEAKER_06]: And vote or P. Diddy will kill you.

03:02:35.969 --> 03:02:38.569
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, we're talking about the podcast voice.

03:02:39.969 --> 03:02:42.550
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we mean the election on Tuesday.

03:02:42.570 --> 03:02:44.130
[SPEAKER_06]: Get your friends to vote, too.

03:02:45.090 --> 03:02:45.590
[SPEAKER_06]: For both.

03:02:45.670 --> 03:02:46.391
[SPEAKER_06]: More the merrier.

03:02:46.471 --> 03:02:46.851
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

03:02:47.091 --> 03:02:47.311
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

03:02:47.551 --> 03:02:48.071
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, you guys.

03:02:48.291 --> 03:02:49.071

03:02:49.111 --> 03:02:51.431
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see you next week to do this all over again.

03:02:52.112 --> 03:02:53.252
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's the closing music?

03:02:55.796 --> 03:02:57.140
[SPEAKER_06]: for your consideration.

03:02:57.261 --> 03:02:58.585
