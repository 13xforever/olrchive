00:00.000 --> 00:19.780
Tonight, November 4th, 2012, Sony reports a loss of close to $200 million.

00:19.780 --> 00:24.600
Details emerge on Nintendo Network Premium, and one vice president of a retail gaming

00:24.600 --> 00:29.760
company pleads guilty to embezzlement.

00:29.760 --> 00:35.180
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show

00:35.180 --> 00:37.360
where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.360 --> 00:45.420
It is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 480 for this November the 4th of 2012.

00:45.420 --> 00:50.000
I hope for those of you guys that go out and do stuff on Halloween, you had a good Halloween,

00:50.000 --> 00:53.300
and I can't believe it, but now is that time of year where we start seeing all the Christmas

00:53.300 --> 00:58.920
stuff show up in stores and all that fa la la la la la la, and I'm sure wanting to comment

00:58.920 --> 01:01.960
on that is the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.

01:01.960 --> 01:07.560
I still haven't seen any Hanukkah stuff, and Hanukkah is like two weeks before Christmas.

01:07.560 --> 01:10.080
It's just, it's not fair.

01:10.080 --> 01:17.160
I think that it's bigotry, it's prejudice.

01:17.160 --> 01:24.280
To be fair, I haven't seen any Festivus polls, so they're hating on Festivus 2, so.

01:24.280 --> 01:25.280
Oh my god.

01:25.280 --> 01:26.280
Anyhow.

01:26.280 --> 01:30.320
I just saw a funny thing in chat, so I'm not gonna say it because I'm not talking about

01:30.320 --> 01:31.320
politics.

01:31.320 --> 01:32.320
Alright.

01:32.320 --> 01:33.320
Thank gosh.

01:33.320 --> 01:34.320
Alright.

01:34.320 --> 01:35.720
Also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:35.720 --> 01:36.720
Hi.

01:36.720 --> 01:37.720
How are you, Loki?

01:37.720 --> 01:38.720
I'm fine.

01:38.720 --> 01:39.720
Excellent.

01:39.720 --> 01:40.720
What's new with you?

01:40.720 --> 01:41.720
How was your week?

01:41.720 --> 01:42.720
It's been alright.

01:42.720 --> 01:43.720
Yeah?

01:43.720 --> 01:44.720
Lots of Minecraft.

01:44.720 --> 01:45.720
Lots of Minecraft.

01:45.720 --> 01:49.240
You were showing me, okay tell me about this little thing you were, this was cool, this

01:49.240 --> 01:51.400
map thing you were showing me before the show.

01:51.400 --> 01:52.400
How does that work?

01:52.400 --> 01:53.920
How can our listeners check this out?

01:53.920 --> 01:54.920
You can check it out.

01:54.920 --> 02:00.520
This new website I made for the VoG Minecraft server, it's basically because I get free

02:00.520 --> 02:05.440
website hosting for having the Minecraft server being hosted by this company, and I needed

02:05.440 --> 02:14.800
a webpage to put this map plugin on, so it's, if you go to vogmc.co.cc, and that will pull

02:14.800 --> 02:23.840
up the, it's a plugin called dynamic map, and basically it's almost in real time.

02:23.840 --> 02:27.600
There's a little bit of, there's some glitches, like I've noticed a few blocks not updating,

02:27.600 --> 02:33.560
but it's pretty much in real time, and it shows just everything that's on the server.

02:33.560 --> 02:40.680
You can take a peek and see what people are building, and just kind of how things look.

02:40.680 --> 02:45.080
Maybe get you interested in joining up on the server, because it's fun.

02:45.080 --> 02:48.360
So we've got that, but yeah, check it out.

02:48.360 --> 02:51.040
You can even see when people are playing, you can see them moving around and where they're

02:51.040 --> 02:55.520
at and stuff like that, and you can watch chat, so it's kind of fun.

02:55.520 --> 02:58.940
That's kind of neat, that you can do that all live, and I like being able to see kind

02:58.940 --> 03:03.200
of the, like, just isometric view, and I even found my house on there, you helped, but I

03:03.200 --> 03:04.600
was able to find the house and all that stuff.

03:04.600 --> 03:08.120
Yeah, I haven't gotten around to labeling everything yet, like some people's places,

03:08.120 --> 03:10.080
I don't know who built them, you know.

03:10.080 --> 03:11.680
I know, I was like, Loki, what's that?

03:11.680 --> 03:12.680
I don't know.

03:12.680 --> 03:13.680
Loki, what's that?

03:13.680 --> 03:14.680
I don't know.

03:14.680 --> 03:17.540
It's like, I've seen that there, I just don't remember, and there was one time I did see

03:17.540 --> 03:22.300
who built it, but I don't remember who it was, because they were standing there, idling,

03:22.300 --> 03:28.000
and I just, I didn't remember, because some people are not, you know, responsible enough

03:28.000 --> 03:33.200
to label their houses with signs, so I know who's, you know, building what.

03:33.200 --> 03:35.980
Your roller coaster is epic too, by the way.

03:35.980 --> 03:36.980
It's pretty large.

03:36.980 --> 03:37.980
I haven't ridden it yet.

03:37.980 --> 03:38.980
I'm still not going to play it until someone buys it for me.

03:38.980 --> 03:43.020
But I, what she's not going to tell you is that when she saw the map and was looking

03:43.020 --> 03:46.300
at everything, she was like, okay, maybe I do need to play this.

03:46.860 --> 03:47.860
No, no.

03:47.860 --> 03:49.460
She's starting to turn around a little bit.

03:49.460 --> 03:50.460
Yeah.

03:50.460 --> 03:51.460
Loki's magic is working a little bit.

03:51.460 --> 03:54.540
I'm going to put my foot down, when someone buys it for me, then I'll play it.

03:54.540 --> 03:57.740
All right, well, maybe Hanukkah Harry will bring you a copy.

03:57.740 --> 04:00.540
I'd rather have the N7 hoodie.

04:00.540 --> 04:01.540
All right.

04:01.540 --> 04:05.140
Um, let's see, other kickoff topics I wanted to talk about tonight.

04:05.140 --> 04:09.480
I did not realize, Loki, you did not go see the big movie that everybody in the gaming

04:09.480 --> 04:12.700
world's talking about this weekend, Wreck-It Ralph.

04:12.700 --> 04:13.700
What stopped you from going?

04:13.700 --> 04:15.700
You see all the big new movies.

04:16.100 --> 04:17.100
No, I don't actually.

04:17.100 --> 04:18.100
You usually do.

04:18.100 --> 04:20.100
I used to before I had a kid.

04:20.100 --> 04:22.700
Oh, is that, well, this is a kid's movie, sorta.

04:22.700 --> 04:25.540
Well, I just, I didn't get a chance to go see it.

04:25.540 --> 04:30.060
I mean, I still want to see it, but it's just, I haven't gotten to go see it yet.

04:30.060 --> 04:31.060
All right.

04:31.060 --> 04:33.380
Well, I thought I'd start off with this topic tonight cause a lot of people talking about

04:33.380 --> 04:34.380
this movie.

04:34.380 --> 04:35.380
It was good.

04:35.380 --> 04:36.380
It was good.

04:36.380 --> 04:42.380
Wreck-It Ralph, uh, was the top of the box office this weekend and made 49.1 million.

04:42.380 --> 04:45.940
That is the estimate for on today, Sunday, the day we are recording.

04:45.940 --> 04:50.340
And apparently they're crediting its performance, which was very good.

04:50.340 --> 04:54.820
It's the highest Disney animation classic opening ever.

04:54.820 --> 04:58.920
I want to note it was, even though it looked like a Pixar movie, it was not a Pixar movie.

04:58.920 --> 05:03.860
So it did not beat all the Pixar movies, but it did be all of the Disney classics, which

05:03.860 --> 05:08.380
includes Tangled, which was also kind of that same animation style.

05:08.380 --> 05:12.260
If you saw that movie, but it made 49.1 million, at least that's the estimate.

05:12.260 --> 05:17.760
Now the interesting thing is they are crediting Hurricane Sandy for some of the reason why

05:17.760 --> 05:21.660
it did so well, because a lot of kids didn't have school on Friday.

05:21.660 --> 05:26.380
A lot of people wanted to just get away, you know, out of the nightmare that they'd been

05:26.380 --> 05:28.800
living the past week and go see a movie.

05:28.800 --> 05:33.700
So they're actually saying it was part of the reason it had a little bit of a boost.

05:33.700 --> 05:34.700
But I don't know.

05:34.700 --> 05:37.820
I mean, I, I just know a lot of people that I know were really interested in seeing this

05:37.820 --> 05:43.080
movie and it really did seem like the type of thing that was geared at families as well

05:43.080 --> 05:48.620
as, you know, it had the classic stuff was great.

05:48.620 --> 05:52.820
The references, if you caught them, I have to go see it again.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.860
I'm going to try to phrase this without spoiling it.

05:54.860 --> 05:55.860
I saw it too.

05:55.860 --> 05:56.940
And I had a great time.

05:56.940 --> 06:02.300
And I think the great thing about it is that, well, obviously I like two things and we talk

06:02.300 --> 06:05.420
about it a lot on this show, video games and Disney.

06:05.420 --> 06:07.460
And this movie was really both.

06:07.820 --> 06:15.100
The neat thing about it is that it wasn't really about the video games.

06:15.100 --> 06:20.220
It was, but it wasn't like, there's a lot of people asking, why isn't Mario in the movie?

06:20.220 --> 06:22.060
Why is Bowser in the movie and not Mario?

06:22.060 --> 06:25.980
And the real answer is that he's expensive, but I think there's another layer to it.

06:25.980 --> 06:29.220
And that is if Mario had been in the movie, it would have been kind of distracting because

06:29.220 --> 06:30.880
this movie is not about Mario.

06:30.880 --> 06:35.740
It's about these made up characters that exist in this universe with all the characters that

06:35.740 --> 06:37.020
we love.

06:37.020 --> 06:41.820
So I kind of think it was neat that it was this very traditional Disney story.

06:41.820 --> 06:46.700
And for all practical purposes, it was pretty formulaic for the rest of the Disney movies.

06:46.700 --> 06:48.700
Not that that's a bad thing.

06:48.700 --> 06:51.900
But you know, it was kind of what you'd expect from a Disney movie.

06:51.900 --> 06:58.540
But it took place in this universe that co-exists alongside Street Fighter, Qbert, you know,

06:58.540 --> 07:01.220
Sega games, all these other things.

07:01.220 --> 07:02.860
What did you think about them going to the Tapper?

07:02.860 --> 07:04.620
Oh, I thought that was great.

07:04.620 --> 07:05.620
Yeah.

07:06.020 --> 07:07.780
I thought about you when I saw that.

07:07.780 --> 07:08.780
Where they reference Tapper.

07:08.780 --> 07:11.740
And one of my friends sitting next to me was like, is Tapper a real game?

07:11.740 --> 07:14.060
I'm like, oh, my God, how old are you?

07:14.060 --> 07:15.980
I'm like, I'm way older than you.

07:15.980 --> 07:18.860
I remember Tapper when it was in the arcades.

07:18.860 --> 07:23.860
Dan completely jumped at the and I'm not going to say any more than this, the road blasters.

07:23.860 --> 07:24.860
Mm hmm.

07:24.860 --> 07:25.860
Yeah.

07:25.860 --> 07:31.980
And we thought of what the the one thing was supposed to be a reference to as far as another

07:31.980 --> 07:32.980
game.

07:32.980 --> 07:33.980
It actually was related to another game.

07:34.340 --> 07:35.340
Rally X.

07:35.340 --> 07:36.340
Oh, yeah.

07:36.340 --> 07:37.340
Yeah.

07:37.340 --> 07:41.140
So and there was lots of little references and I don't want to spoil everything, but

07:41.140 --> 07:44.780
I will say, if you haven't seen the movie yet, you plan on seeing it soon.

07:44.780 --> 07:47.860
A stay till the very, very, very end of the credits.

07:47.860 --> 07:48.860
Yes.

07:48.860 --> 07:52.140
For a little, you know, like most movies, it's not a big thing, but it's one of those

07:52.140 --> 07:54.940
things that when you see it, you'll be like, oh, that's clever.

07:54.940 --> 07:55.940
That's funny.

07:55.940 --> 07:56.940
L.O.L.

07:56.940 --> 08:01.820
And then also, crap, what else is I going to say?

08:01.820 --> 08:02.820
I don't know.

08:02.820 --> 08:03.820
The graffiti.

08:04.660 --> 08:05.660
Keep an eye out for the various graffiti.

08:05.660 --> 08:08.280
There's so many little jokes on the side.

08:08.280 --> 08:13.100
And actually, you can see Princess Peach and Princess Toadstool like totally in the movie,

08:13.100 --> 08:14.860
but they're like in the background.

08:14.860 --> 08:15.860
It's it.

08:15.860 --> 08:16.860
But it's them.

08:16.860 --> 08:17.860
It's totally.

08:17.860 --> 08:19.540
There was the one scene with the one walking with the two with Chinley walking with the

08:19.540 --> 08:23.260
two princesses, but neither of them were.

08:23.260 --> 08:25.860
Peter, I think one of one of them was in blue.

08:25.860 --> 08:26.860
I think one was day.

08:26.860 --> 08:27.860
Oh, probably Pauline.

08:27.860 --> 08:28.860
Yeah.

08:28.860 --> 08:29.860
Yeah.

08:29.860 --> 08:30.860
And Pauline.

08:30.860 --> 08:31.860
So very interesting.

08:31.860 --> 08:33.500
Let's go to our chat room.

08:34.180 --> 08:38.140
I'm being a very bad boy and I did not introduce our chat yet, but we do love our live chatters.

08:38.140 --> 08:39.300
We love the podcast listeners.

08:39.300 --> 08:43.540
We also have the people that join us live every Sunday night at the voice voice of Geeks

08:43.540 --> 08:45.980
Network or vog network dot com.

08:45.980 --> 08:49.900
We do tape live every Sunday night at six Pacific and nine o'clock Eastern right after

08:49.900 --> 08:52.140
the Bobby Black Wolf show.

08:52.140 --> 08:55.700
And we have a live chat room that you can chat along with us at live dot vog network

08:55.700 --> 08:57.140
dot com.

08:57.140 --> 09:00.380
And Game Guru in chat says it was Daisy and Rosalina.

09:00.380 --> 09:01.380
That's the name.

09:01.380 --> 09:02.380
I couldn't think of her name.

09:02.380 --> 09:03.380
It was Rosalina.

09:04.260 --> 09:05.460
Pauline was Donkey Kong.

09:05.460 --> 09:06.460
Yeah.

09:06.460 --> 09:09.860
Pauline was Donkey Kong, but I thought they retroactively made her a princess or something.

09:09.860 --> 09:11.220
I thought there was some retcon.

09:11.220 --> 09:12.660
She was wearing pink.

09:12.660 --> 09:16.620
It's like the same thing where everybody's like, oh, Leia is a Disney princess now.

09:16.620 --> 09:17.740
Leia is a Disney princess.

09:17.740 --> 09:19.540
That's the way I just think that that's funny.

09:19.540 --> 09:20.540
Hold on.

09:20.540 --> 09:21.540
Put the brakes on that chat.

09:21.540 --> 09:23.740
We'll get there in a minute.

09:23.740 --> 09:25.660
But meanwhile, let's see.

09:25.660 --> 09:29.580
Dan Shadow in our chat room says, I hate end credits crap.

09:29.580 --> 09:31.180
I hate end credits crap.

09:31.180 --> 09:32.900
Do you hate end credits crap?

09:33.420 --> 09:34.660
I love it.

09:34.660 --> 09:39.580
I actually make a habit of staying through the credits regardless, because I think that

09:39.580 --> 09:43.300
a lot of people behind the scenes put a lot of hard work in the movie and that's sort

09:43.300 --> 09:45.140
of my nod to them and that.

09:45.140 --> 09:46.140
And I hear good music.

09:46.140 --> 09:47.540
I check the soundtrack listings.

09:47.540 --> 09:50.100
I downloaded the soundtrack in the theater.

09:50.100 --> 09:53.140
I had a room, AKB 48.

09:53.140 --> 09:56.100
I had a roommate in college that was very much like you, where it was like whenever

09:56.100 --> 09:58.860
we would go to see the movies, it's like, nope, we're not leaving till after the credits

09:58.860 --> 09:59.860
was over.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.660
And it was nothing about bonus scenes or anything like that.

10:01.660 --> 10:04.860
It was just, no, we're going to watch the entire movie.

10:04.860 --> 10:07.960
And I was like, all right, I guess everybody's got their thing.

10:07.960 --> 10:08.960
You don't want it.

10:08.960 --> 10:10.060
You don't want to get the jump on getting out of here.

10:10.060 --> 10:11.060
Get parking lot.

10:11.060 --> 10:12.060
All right.

10:12.060 --> 10:13.060
All right.

10:13.060 --> 10:14.060
We'll stay and watch the credits.

10:14.060 --> 10:15.060
It's fine.

10:15.060 --> 10:16.060
So I think that's that's fine though.

10:16.060 --> 10:17.060
Let's see.

10:17.060 --> 10:20.740
What is to see some people talking about the wizard.

10:20.740 --> 10:25.340
Raginator says, so Wreck-It Ralph was about as much about video games as the wizard was

10:25.340 --> 10:26.540
then.

10:26.540 --> 10:29.620
In a funny way, yes.

10:30.180 --> 10:34.980
I kind of don't like acknowledging that that reference works because the wizard was a very

10:34.980 --> 10:36.280
different type of movie.

10:36.280 --> 10:38.540
And for all practical purposes, let's be real.

10:38.540 --> 10:41.020
It wasn't a very good movie.

10:41.020 --> 10:45.420
We just, we remember it being awesome because we were kids and it had that look at Super

10:45.420 --> 10:51.100
Mario three and you know, the power glove, it's so bad and all that like commercial shit

10:51.100 --> 10:53.220
that's like, you know, shoved down your throat.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.380
Wreck-It Ralph didn't really have that.

10:54.380 --> 10:55.900
Like Wreck-It Ralph wasn't the Wii.

10:55.900 --> 10:56.900
It wiggles.

10:57.500 --> 11:00.620
Now I did see a Wii U commercial in the theater before the movie.

11:00.620 --> 11:02.500
That's the only time I've seen a Wii U commercial.

11:02.500 --> 11:03.940
Somebody was asking, they only have one.

11:03.940 --> 11:06.980
Somebody was asking on Twitter today, like, why are there not Wii U commercials on TV

11:06.980 --> 11:07.980
and all this stuff?

11:07.980 --> 11:09.780
I'm like, I saw one in the movie theater.

11:09.780 --> 11:11.860
Putting it before Wreck-It Ralph seems like a nice place to do it.

11:11.860 --> 11:12.860
You know what?

11:12.860 --> 11:16.900
They did this thing for Cartoon Network live TV shows.

11:16.900 --> 11:23.060
And my husband was like, I miss that commercial that ran for five years with What's-Her-Face.

11:23.060 --> 11:24.060
What was it?

11:24.060 --> 11:25.060
The Closer?

11:25.060 --> 11:26.060
Or something?

11:26.940 --> 11:31.620
But then they showed the Ultimate Geek trailer because you know how lately, I don't know

11:31.620 --> 11:34.660
if every theater in America does this, but at least all the ones around here do.

11:34.660 --> 11:38.500
They have that thing called the Fathom Events where it's like the Metropolitan Night at

11:38.500 --> 11:42.500
the Opera or I think Riff Tracks does their stuff through Fathom Events.

11:42.500 --> 11:44.580
But here's the big thing they're doing at the end of November.

11:44.580 --> 11:49.220
They're doing two episodes of Star Trek The Next Generation in HD.

11:49.220 --> 11:50.220
People cheered.

11:50.220 --> 11:52.700
And everybody in the theater cheered.

11:52.700 --> 11:53.700
And we're like.

11:53.700 --> 11:54.700
Because it's geeks.

11:54.740 --> 11:56.420
This one is DS9, bitches.

11:59.420 --> 12:01.740
But just for the record, I still want to go to that.

12:01.740 --> 12:02.740
Just saying.

12:02.740 --> 12:07.140
We need to make plans November 29th because I love Star Trek The Next Generation.

12:07.140 --> 12:08.140
All right.

12:08.140 --> 12:09.140
Let's see.

12:09.140 --> 12:10.140
What else?

12:10.140 --> 12:11.620
What else did I want to say about the movie?

12:11.620 --> 12:12.620
I don't know.

12:12.620 --> 12:14.220
I liked it quite a bit.

12:14.220 --> 12:19.900
You know, again, it's not like shoving the video games in your face, but I'm really glad

12:20.180 --> 12:24.340
that this part of pop culture is just.

12:24.340 --> 12:27.920
It's there and it's being acknowledged without it being niche.

12:27.920 --> 12:32.220
And it's really cool now that, you know, I think there's a lot of parents out there who

12:32.220 --> 12:35.340
remember a lot of these games from when they were younger.

12:35.340 --> 12:37.780
And now we need a TV series, right?

12:37.780 --> 12:41.380
Well, it will be interesting to see if the movie continues to do well.

12:41.380 --> 12:44.980
I heard it had a very large budget, so it has a lot of money to make up.

12:44.980 --> 12:48.460
But if the movie does well, which, you know, if it's had a bigger opening than Tangled

12:48.500 --> 12:53.060
and there's really not a lot of competition for the movie coming till Thanksgiving, it

12:53.060 --> 12:54.500
stands to do pretty well.

12:54.500 --> 12:57.180
It will be interesting to see, does this mean sequel?

12:57.180 --> 13:01.480
Does this mean Disney Park integration is possible?

13:01.480 --> 13:03.680
They're putting a Tangled thing into Disneyland.

13:03.680 --> 13:08.400
The expanded Fantasyland is going to have a Tangled section to it.

13:08.400 --> 13:11.060
So could Wreck-It Ralph come to Tomorrowland?

13:11.060 --> 13:15.940
Could the arcade, you know, which is kind of a bummer because I was hoping it would

13:15.940 --> 13:17.940
be Tron, but I do love it.

13:18.940 --> 13:19.940
Let's hope.

13:19.940 --> 13:20.940
Let's hope.

13:20.940 --> 13:21.940
I hope.

13:21.940 --> 13:22.940
I don't doubt the other world.

13:22.940 --> 13:25.900
All right, let's quickly talk about the other nerd news that came out this week before we

13:25.900 --> 13:31.500
get into video games, because this does affect video games a tiny, tiny bit, but I am positive

13:31.500 --> 13:36.660
you all have heard this, but if for some reason you've been just like locked away in a nuclear

13:36.660 --> 13:42.340
fallout shelter for the past, you know, week, Disney bought LucasArts this week and they

13:42.340 --> 13:46.900
paid what, $4.5 billion for it and promptly announced they're making Star Wars Episode

13:46.900 --> 13:51.260
7 and obviously this meets hugely mixed fanboy reaction.

13:51.260 --> 13:52.740
Did you hear the other side of that?

13:52.740 --> 13:55.700
Lucas turned around and donated the money to education.

13:55.700 --> 13:57.420
He said he's going to donate it to education.

13:57.420 --> 13:58.420
He hasn't done it yet.

13:58.420 --> 13:59.540
He just announced plans to.

13:59.540 --> 14:04.180
By education he means an educator, which is Indiana Jones, which he owns, but it's just

14:04.180 --> 14:05.180
donated to himself.

14:05.180 --> 14:07.980
Well, I don't want to be morbid, but does that mean he's going to die?

14:07.980 --> 14:11.100
Because like, isn't that a little weird that he's like offloading it all?

14:11.100 --> 14:14.740
Well, he's probably just ready to retire.

14:15.300 --> 14:19.060
He's keeping his Marin properties.

14:19.060 --> 14:27.180
So the game developing building and his ranch, the Skywalker Ranch, is staying under his

14:27.180 --> 14:32.580
property, including everything that's on it, but the company itself, because he wanted

14:32.580 --> 14:35.860
to build a movie theater in Marin County and all the people with their nose in the air

14:35.860 --> 14:39.300
said, well, it is Marin County.

14:39.300 --> 14:40.300
Yeah.

14:40.300 --> 14:44.040
So, so I think that had something to do with it, but yeah, one story.

14:44.040 --> 14:45.400
But no, no, no, it's fine.

14:45.400 --> 14:46.400
But here's the thing.

14:46.400 --> 14:51.840
Besides the Star Wars thing, which personally, I thank God somebody took it away from Lucas.

14:51.840 --> 14:52.840
Let's be real.

14:52.840 --> 14:54.000
Indiana Jones.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.680
How can it be worse than the prequels?

14:56.680 --> 14:59.640
How will it possibly be worse than the prequels?

14:59.640 --> 15:03.880
I don't care if it is Mickey and Goofy, you know, which it won't be.

15:03.880 --> 15:04.880
We all know it won't be.

15:04.880 --> 15:07.080
How can it possibly be worse than the prequels?

15:07.080 --> 15:10.280
There was a statement too that it's changing the canon from the books.

15:10.280 --> 15:12.680
Well, I seem to remember.

15:12.680 --> 15:13.680
Who reads books nowadays?

15:13.680 --> 15:16.080
Well, it's not a lot of people that are in those days.

15:16.080 --> 15:20.480
I realized that they, people want those Star Wars books to be adapted, but I seem to recall

15:20.480 --> 15:24.620
around the time the prequels came out, there were many interviews with George Lucas where

15:24.620 --> 15:31.080
he said, when he did the first trilogy, he always planned for there to be three trilogies

15:31.080 --> 15:36.060
and the recurring characters that would be an online movies would be C3PO and R2D2.

15:36.060 --> 15:40.440
And there'd be a trilogy before the original trilogy and there'd be a trilogy after the

15:40.440 --> 15:42.000
original trilogy.

15:42.000 --> 15:46.160
And he always said that it was going to be nine movies.

15:46.160 --> 15:49.020
But then when he was making the prequels, he was like, you know what?

15:49.020 --> 15:51.840
I don't think there's going to be anything else after this.

15:51.840 --> 15:56.040
But now that he's actually the creative consultant or whatever, my thought is Disney's going

15:56.040 --> 16:01.320
to take his outline for the nine movies or the seven, eight, nine movies and make that

16:01.320 --> 16:02.320
which...

16:02.320 --> 16:03.320
Better dialogue.

16:03.320 --> 16:04.320
Yeah.

16:04.320 --> 16:09.360
And he told, it's out there that he talked with Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher last year

16:09.360 --> 16:10.360
about this.

16:10.360 --> 16:14.320
They're way too old to reprise the roles unless it's way set in the future.

16:14.320 --> 16:21.360
Or they said that Luke Skywalker could be the Obi-Wan Kenobi type of the new movies

16:21.360 --> 16:23.000
and that would make a lot of sense.

16:23.000 --> 16:27.300
But the reoccurring characters would be C3PO and R2D2 because they're androids, they don't

16:27.300 --> 16:28.300
die.

16:28.300 --> 16:31.440
And that makes a lot of sense.

16:31.440 --> 16:38.040
But I'm curious enough, anyhow, sorry, I didn't mean to get on a movie tangent.

16:38.040 --> 16:41.960
The big thing is that if they're going to, I mean, for them to realistically have those

16:41.960 --> 16:49.600
people play the same characters, they're going to have to change the book canon anyway.

16:49.600 --> 16:55.600
Which honestly, the book canon was going way too crazy and I couldn't even deal with it.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.520
Rageinator says, how can it be worse?

16:57.520 --> 17:00.640
This is how episode seven can be centered around Jar Jar.

17:00.640 --> 17:01.640
It can't.

17:01.640 --> 17:03.320
Seven will be after the original trilogy.

17:03.320 --> 17:05.000
Jar Jar will be dead.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.120
In fact, I want to point this out.

17:07.120 --> 17:11.040
If you think that Disney's going to fuck up Star Wars, you need to go ride the new Star

17:11.040 --> 17:16.040
Tours ride because the best ending on that's because you know, the Star Wars ride has the

17:16.040 --> 17:17.180
multiple endings.

17:17.180 --> 17:21.360
The best ending is the one where they go to Jar Jar's planet because somebody, somebody

17:21.360 --> 17:23.520
shoots him.

17:23.520 --> 17:27.100
Disney shot Jar Jar and you all are pissed.

17:27.100 --> 17:29.640
By the way, Rob, your nerd logic doesn't make sense.

17:29.640 --> 17:30.640
Let it go.

17:30.640 --> 17:31.640
By the way, I finally got Hoth.

17:31.640 --> 17:32.640
Oh, did you?

17:32.640 --> 17:33.640
It was awesome.

17:33.640 --> 17:34.640
Yeah, it is awesome.

17:35.280 --> 17:36.280
The ice plan is the best.

17:36.280 --> 17:42.360
But anyhow, uh, let's see, uh, that, uh, that, uh, that, uh, YYR says Star Wars episode seven

17:42.360 --> 17:44.640
begins with the assassination of Jar Jar Binks.

17:44.640 --> 17:45.640
You're welcome.

17:45.640 --> 17:47.680
Uh, no, he won't be in it at all.

17:47.680 --> 17:48.960
They're just going to look past it.

17:48.960 --> 17:53.800
Uh, as you want to get gunk and live for hundreds of years, SSJ 100, Matt says, just please

17:53.800 --> 17:57.520
don't have JJ Abrams direct the next three.

17:57.520 --> 18:01.060
That would be weird because that's like the crossing the streams thing.

18:01.060 --> 18:03.260
You don't cross Trek and Wars.

18:03.260 --> 18:06.880
Like I've seen a lot of people campaigning for Zachary Quinto to be a villain in Star

18:06.880 --> 18:07.880
Wars.

18:07.880 --> 18:12.160
He can't, he's locked into Trek and I just, I think there is this nerd thing.

18:12.160 --> 18:13.820
You don't cross Trek and Wars.

18:13.820 --> 18:14.820
You can't do it.

18:14.820 --> 18:20.060
However, it is completely hilarious to sing Star Trek in, in line for Star, Star Wars.

18:20.060 --> 18:23.780
Just saying, especially when you get the cast members singing along with you.

18:23.780 --> 18:28.900
Um, let's see, uh, the Rob D says Han and Leia's kids have a complete story.

18:28.900 --> 18:29.900
Seriously.

18:29.900 --> 18:32.800
The books go so far into the future that the story of their kids has been told.

18:32.840 --> 18:34.360
I think it would make a lot of sense.

18:34.360 --> 18:35.560
I swear we'll get to games.

18:35.560 --> 18:39.860
I brought this up to talk games and I'm talking movies and I'm always more of a Trek fan than

18:39.860 --> 18:40.860
a Wars fan.

18:40.860 --> 18:46.140
But I think it would make a lot of sense for the Star Wars next trilogy to be about the

18:46.140 --> 18:51.880
children of Luke Skywalker because the books that were about Han and Leia's kids, but that

18:51.880 --> 18:53.260
doesn't mean it has to be on the books.

18:53.260 --> 18:54.260
Get away from the book.

18:54.260 --> 18:55.260
The books are not being turned into movies.

18:55.260 --> 18:56.260
Mara Jade is in it.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.260
I'm happy.

18:57.260 --> 18:58.260
The books will not be turned into movies.

18:58.260 --> 18:59.260
Period.

18:59.260 --> 19:00.260
Mara Jade needs to be in it.

19:00.260 --> 19:01.620
You're stretching it.

19:01.620 --> 19:07.300
That may happen only because they ended up calling one of the planets Kors Kont in the

19:07.300 --> 19:09.300
prequels because that came from the books.

19:09.300 --> 19:10.300
Yeah.

19:10.300 --> 19:13.300
So they also referenced it in, I think the first one.

19:13.300 --> 19:14.300
Oh, anyway.

19:14.300 --> 19:17.700
Uh, Tiger Claw says, how about Joss Whedon directing Star Wars?

19:17.700 --> 19:18.700
I could go with that.

19:18.700 --> 19:22.780
Um, I think while that would make a lot of nerds happy, why don't you give him the time

19:22.780 --> 19:24.420
to do all this stuff with the Avengers?

19:24.420 --> 19:26.020
Like he's one guy.

19:26.020 --> 19:28.500
He can't, he can't do everything nerd.

19:28.500 --> 19:35.340
Um, I would, I'd like to see some of these, um, Oh God, I'm going to get, I'm going to

19:35.340 --> 19:39.240
get so much shit for this, but I think it would be really cool to get somebody like

19:39.240 --> 19:44.660
one of the, um, uh, Harry Potter directors that made the really looking forward to Tim

19:44.660 --> 19:45.660
Burton's adaptation.

19:45.660 --> 19:47.460
No, no, no, no, no.

19:47.460 --> 19:53.660
Alfonso Cuaron who did the third, um, Guillermo del Toro, although he didn't do a Harry Potter

19:53.660 --> 19:56.660
movie, but he's, you know, Pan's Labyrinth and all the stuff he does.

19:57.660 --> 19:58.660
Yeah.

19:58.660 --> 19:59.660
All right.

19:59.660 --> 20:02.500
Look, the quick thing I wanted to say, and then I swear we'll get to video games.

20:02.500 --> 20:03.940
This is about video games.

20:03.940 --> 20:07.660
When Disney bought Lucas arts, they didn't just buy Star Wars.

20:07.660 --> 20:08.660
That's all everybody's talking about.

20:08.660 --> 20:11.460
Cause they announced Star Wars episode seven, but they, what do they get with this?

20:11.460 --> 20:16.780
They get Indiana Jones, they get American graffiti, ha ha ha.

20:16.780 --> 20:25.280
They get all the Lucas arts games belong to Disney now, although I kind of doubt Disney's

20:25.320 --> 20:27.320
going to do anything with it.

20:27.320 --> 20:28.320
Maniac mansion.

20:28.320 --> 20:29.320
That's right.

20:29.320 --> 20:30.580
Disney now owns maniac mansion.

20:30.580 --> 20:34.040
I doubt they'll do anything with it, but they did say they were very interested in developing

20:34.040 --> 20:37.880
the games in the mobile and social space.

20:37.880 --> 20:43.880
I would love to see an animated maniac mansion movie, but they'll probably continue to contract

20:43.880 --> 20:48.080
with other developers to do Star Wars on the console.

20:48.080 --> 20:51.400
Now if we're talking like Tim Burton, that is a movie that Tim Burton would be perfect

20:51.400 --> 20:53.040
doing maniac mansion.

20:53.040 --> 20:55.240
Oh, that would be awesome.

20:55.240 --> 20:56.800
And uh, Oh, good points in our chat room.

20:56.800 --> 20:58.640
Dan shadow says ILM.

20:58.640 --> 20:59.640
That's very true.

20:59.640 --> 21:01.800
Tiger class says Skywalker sound.

21:01.800 --> 21:03.240
So Disney picks up all that.

21:03.240 --> 21:04.240
That's great.

21:04.240 --> 21:10.520
And again, I'm just going to say, how can it get, how can it get any worse than it already

21:10.520 --> 21:11.520
was?

21:11.520 --> 21:19.120
And what I mean by that is if you have played that Star Wars connect game, have you played

21:19.120 --> 21:20.120
that Star Wars connect game?

21:20.120 --> 21:22.880
I just, because I'm smart enough to know that it's terrible.

21:22.880 --> 21:25.480
I just want to remind you be quiet advertisement.

21:25.480 --> 21:29.680
I just want to remind you of a little sequence that's in the, uh, in the star Wars connect

21:29.680 --> 21:30.680
game.

21:30.680 --> 21:34.040
And that is the dance battle to I'm Han solo.

21:34.040 --> 21:35.520
Let me play a little clip of that.

21:35.520 --> 21:36.520
Just there's a bunch.

21:36.520 --> 21:38.240
All of the songs are easily terrible.

21:38.240 --> 21:42.140
Just to remind you how bad things can be.

21:42.140 --> 21:43.140
Just want to remind you that here

21:43.140 --> 21:49.900
have you seen this board?

21:49.900 --> 22:03.140
Our saga, this star Wars connect game

22:03.140 --> 22:06.080
and that's going to get worse under Disney.

22:06.080 --> 22:09.060
It can't get worse at famous last words.

22:09.060 --> 22:12.460
It can't get worse.

22:12.460 --> 22:18.540
Disney owns the rights to Howard, the duck, however, they actually do own Howard, the

22:18.540 --> 22:21.340
duck because they own Marvel.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.340
All right.

22:22.340 --> 22:23.340
Rageinator says, just wait.

22:23.340 --> 22:25.300
Disney will buy the rights to rock your picture show next.

22:25.300 --> 22:28.580
And then they'll blend star Wars and rock your picture show and sky would probably squeak.

22:28.580 --> 22:31.980
No, that wouldn't happen because that would involve buying 20th century Fox.

22:31.980 --> 22:39.980
And I think, I think there's laws set up for that big of an acquisition.

22:39.980 --> 22:40.980
Let's see.

22:40.980 --> 22:41.980
Rama says.

22:42.020 --> 22:44.540
Disney makes Marvel a former shell of itself.

22:44.540 --> 22:47.380
Oh, oh yeah.

22:47.380 --> 22:50.340
Disney really fucked up Marvel with that Avengers movie.

22:50.340 --> 22:52.220
They were, oh yeah, that, that was terrible.

22:52.220 --> 22:53.780
Oh, and Disney really fucked them up.

22:53.780 --> 22:54.780
It's over.

22:54.780 --> 22:55.780
Yeah.

22:55.780 --> 23:02.860
That new Muppets movie was really bad compared to the last couple dot, dot, dot.

23:02.860 --> 23:05.340
Is your mic off?

23:05.340 --> 23:06.340
My mic was off.

23:06.340 --> 23:07.340
Sorry.

23:07.340 --> 23:09.140
Now they just need to buy the mega moon franchise.

23:09.140 --> 23:10.140
Yes.

23:10.140 --> 23:11.140
Yes.

23:11.300 --> 23:12.300
And blizzard.

23:12.300 --> 23:13.300
Okay.

23:13.300 --> 23:19.100
Now, God, this is why I miss my old mic cause it didn't have an off switch, but, um, the,

23:19.100 --> 23:22.980
the whole thing I wanted to point out too, is that don't worry anything about Indiana

23:22.980 --> 23:23.980
Jones.

23:23.980 --> 23:27.060
It doesn't matter who has, first of all, I don't want to see another Indiana Jones movie

23:27.060 --> 23:30.420
because it can only be Harrison Ford and he's too old.

23:30.420 --> 23:33.140
We saw this plus that crystal school thing.

23:33.140 --> 23:34.140
Shit.

23:34.140 --> 23:36.860
Disney still has licensing rights to Indiana Jones.

23:36.860 --> 23:41.180
How else are they going to have, you know, the ride for one thing.

23:41.180 --> 23:44.660
How else are they going to have all of the merchandise that they sell at Disneyland?

23:44.660 --> 23:47.580
And on top of that, they have the pinball table.

23:47.580 --> 23:52.700
This is how Indiana Jones, Indiana Jones will come again, but it's going to be in about

23:52.700 --> 23:58.900
10 to 15 years after the Indiana Jones is what Disney will do after the trilogy is done.

23:58.900 --> 24:00.920
And that's going to be a good 10 years away.

24:00.920 --> 24:04.260
They're going to do Indiana Jones next and it will be the good old fashioned Hollywood

24:04.260 --> 24:05.660
fix it reboot.

24:05.660 --> 24:06.660
Just wait for it.

24:06.660 --> 24:09.100
I do not want a Shia LaBeouf reboot.

24:09.100 --> 24:11.060
I want a good actor.

24:11.060 --> 24:13.820
Just saying good reboot could put a good actor in the role.

24:13.820 --> 24:18.220
Just saying, but as long as it needs to be done after we're all dead.

24:18.220 --> 24:19.220
All right.

24:19.220 --> 24:20.940
Too much movies, not enough games.

24:20.940 --> 24:22.580
Let's talk about video games again.

24:22.580 --> 24:25.860
We always like to start off the show, you know, 30 minutes into it with how was your

24:25.860 --> 24:26.980
gaming week?

24:26.980 --> 24:29.060
Let's talk about the video games that you've been playing this week.

24:29.060 --> 24:30.060
Dark soccer.

24:30.060 --> 24:31.060
We'll start with you.

24:31.060 --> 24:36.100
Well, you know, I actually, uh, didn't get to play much cause I started a job, have a

24:36.100 --> 24:37.100
job now.

24:37.100 --> 24:38.100
Congrats.

24:38.100 --> 24:39.100
Thank you.

24:39.100 --> 24:46.180
Um, and, uh, I, uh, I downloaded a demo for a game that I'm going to talk about in part

24:46.180 --> 24:51.200
B. Um, I never got a chance to play it cause I've been working, um, but I've been playing

24:51.200 --> 24:55.580
a bunch of, uh, mass effect two cause I beat mass effect one earlier.

24:55.580 --> 24:57.420
Finally did everything in the first mass effect.

24:57.420 --> 25:01.340
So it wasn't that you had played the demo cause you didn't play the demo cause you were

25:01.340 --> 25:02.340
working.

25:02.340 --> 25:04.220
You didn't play the demo cause you were playing mass effect two.

25:04.220 --> 25:06.500
It has to be real.

25:06.500 --> 25:07.620
Just it's, it's okay.

25:07.620 --> 25:11.880
And I logged into wow long enough so I wouldn't get booted from the guild.

25:11.880 --> 25:17.820
I haven't touched like wow more than long enough to say hi to people since and oh, and

25:17.820 --> 25:20.380
for the record, I still can't get in my mass effect three.

25:20.380 --> 25:22.700
Just saying, that's still a thing.

25:22.700 --> 25:23.700
Yeah.

25:23.700 --> 25:24.700
I watched that.

25:24.700 --> 25:30.700
Um, that mod ending, it was, yeah, somebody actually bad.

25:30.700 --> 25:35.140
Somebody actually made a mod that will change the ending to the happy ending.

25:35.140 --> 25:39.820
They call it the mass effect three happy ending and I clipping issues though.

25:39.820 --> 25:43.920
Well, the thing that cracked me the fuck up is that they inserted video footage obviously

25:43.920 --> 25:48.540
from other places in the game, but some of them had an IGN watermark and I was like,

25:48.540 --> 25:49.540
really?

25:49.540 --> 25:50.540
If yes, really?

25:50.540 --> 25:53.660
No, I mean that was what I was thinking really, really.

25:53.660 --> 26:01.620
And on top of that, most of the footage of the space battle thing is from the low preparedness

26:01.620 --> 26:02.620
thing.

26:02.620 --> 26:03.620
Whatever.

26:03.620 --> 26:05.500
The, the, yeah, I know what you're talking about.

26:05.500 --> 26:06.500
The universe rating.

26:06.500 --> 26:07.500
Yeah.

26:07.500 --> 26:12.060
Cause I've watched like all the different versions of the endings to see what affected

26:12.060 --> 26:13.060
what.

26:13.060 --> 26:16.660
And yeah, that's like from the super low I did shit where the Normandy explodes and everyone

26:16.660 --> 26:17.660
dies ending.

26:17.660 --> 26:18.660
I was like, really?

26:18.660 --> 26:21.700
This must be happy ending, huh?

26:21.700 --> 26:27.700
It was, it was interesting to see it pulled off, but I'm not ready to install it.

26:27.700 --> 26:33.060
I like my destroy ending, you know, that's Canon in my head.

26:33.060 --> 26:37.680
It's very impressive to me that people can mod the ending and like that, that's like

26:37.680 --> 26:40.740
a thing now to like mod the ending to make it the way you want.

26:40.740 --> 26:44.860
And I'm just like, Oh my God, the new trilogy can't get here fast enough.

26:44.860 --> 26:46.780
So people have something new to bitch about.

26:46.780 --> 26:51.320
Well, the whole thing is, is it in theory, I know how it can be done cause really it

26:51.320 --> 26:56.600
would be changing code to insert sequence for pre-rendered stuff and screens for all

26:56.600 --> 26:59.920
of the little, uh, flashbacky things.

26:59.920 --> 27:06.720
Um, and then it was, uh, uh, it would actually be taking preexisting animations and loading

27:06.720 --> 27:12.580
different textures over them, which by the way, that picture of, of Jacob's face over

27:12.580 --> 27:16.280
Garris's body is absolutely hilarious because he has his mouth expanded.

27:16.280 --> 27:18.800
Like it was for the whole Garris face.

27:18.800 --> 27:20.040
That sounds strange.

27:20.040 --> 27:21.040
Very strange.

27:21.400 --> 27:24.880
Have you ever seen them done for, um, smash brothers?

27:24.880 --> 27:25.880
No.

27:25.880 --> 27:33.120
The, uh, the, you can swap, uh, swap the textures and the different characters on, um, on, uh,

27:33.120 --> 27:34.120
smash brothers.

27:34.120 --> 27:38.660
And it changes the actual size and body shape of the character to where you have like a

27:38.660 --> 27:42.160
Kirby with, you know, a princess peach with a huge mouth for Kirby.

27:42.160 --> 27:46.680
Well, yeah, I saw that one, um, mod or whatever that Loki was talking about a couple of weeks

27:46.680 --> 27:51.560
ago on the show that changed all the characters to other gaming franchise characters.

27:51.560 --> 27:52.560
But that was it.

27:52.560 --> 27:53.560
Yeah.

27:53.560 --> 27:57.080
This, this is just like, you have a different frame for the animation, which in Mass Effect

27:57.080 --> 28:01.800
is actually a lot easier because they all use a human skeleton, but, um, not so much

28:01.800 --> 28:03.800
in, uh, smash brothers.

28:03.800 --> 28:08.280
So anyway, uh, the Rob D in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says I'm over Mass

28:08.280 --> 28:09.280
Effect 3.

28:09.280 --> 28:12.880
There's too much else to enjoy to continue bitching about Mass Effect 3.

28:12.880 --> 28:14.140
Ain't that the truth?

28:14.140 --> 28:20.420
And a multiplayer is really great in Mass Effect 3 if it works well on Xbox.

28:20.420 --> 28:21.420
It's been great.

28:21.420 --> 28:22.420
All right.

28:22.420 --> 28:24.940
Anyhow, uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?

28:24.940 --> 28:26.300
Uh, it's basically Minecraft.

28:26.300 --> 28:28.980
I mean, that's what I was doing most of the week.

28:28.980 --> 28:34.920
I finally got the option to, um, switch the server to a bucket server, which is a server

28:34.920 --> 28:36.220
that allows mods.

28:36.220 --> 28:37.220
So that's what I did.

28:37.220 --> 28:39.460
I have it running on a bucket server now.

28:39.460 --> 28:47.100
So aside from the, uh, dynamap, um, thing that I talked about before, uh, we also have

28:47.100 --> 28:52.180
now world edit, which is kind of cool for, you know, making, uh, structures and stuff

28:52.180 --> 28:55.820
really fast and also for like leveling mountains and that kind of fun stuff.

28:55.820 --> 29:01.860
So we have that and a mob arena, which I'm setting up right now, a, uh, a, uh, PVE arena

29:01.860 --> 29:07.940
where you can fight waves and waves of monsters, just to kind of get a little bit of that survival

29:07.940 --> 29:12.340
element in there, because right now we're just playing creative and it'd be fun just

29:12.340 --> 29:15.580
to have something to do, you know, just take a break from building stuff.

29:15.580 --> 29:20.400
You can fight waves of monsters and it's going to get really wacky because you can put like

29:20.400 --> 29:21.400
anything you want in there.

29:21.400 --> 29:22.780
Like you can make a boss monster.

29:22.780 --> 29:27.680
That's a chicken that fight, no launches fireballs or like really crazy stuff.

29:27.680 --> 29:31.780
So we've got, got a lot of work to do on that.

29:31.780 --> 29:37.020
And then, um, I played a little bit of a call of duty this week and, uh, hopefully we'll

29:37.020 --> 29:42.940
be playing black ops two in a couple of weeks here and that's pretty much it.

29:42.940 --> 29:45.100
I think I haven't really played a whole ton this week.

29:45.100 --> 29:46.100
Yeah.

29:46.100 --> 29:47.100
I'm kind of in the same boat as you.

29:47.100 --> 29:48.380
I haven't played a whole ton this week.

29:48.380 --> 29:51.980
Um, uh, more world of Warcraft, which, you know, I'll talk about on Horde house, the

29:51.980 --> 29:56.140
other show a little later this week, but a little preview, a followup for those of you

29:56.140 --> 29:59.900
that do listen to Horde house, our guild did take down the first raid boss.

29:59.900 --> 30:00.900
Finally.

30:00.900 --> 30:01.900
Yay.

30:01.900 --> 30:02.900
Puppies are dead.

30:02.900 --> 30:04.820
And the trick was use three healers instead of two.

30:04.820 --> 30:08.580
The minute we ran it with three healers, we had it down in three polls as opposed to like

30:08.580 --> 30:09.900
the 20 before that.

30:09.900 --> 30:11.900
So that was the trick.

30:11.900 --> 30:15.900
Um, and then I did play some aspect three multiplayer, not to make this a mass effect

30:15.900 --> 30:19.580
show, but they did have the Halloween challenge, which I thought was really cute because they

30:19.580 --> 30:24.740
modded the game to make like the little, the little beacons turned into pumpkins and the

30:24.740 --> 30:28.780
little devices that you did the upload from were all little pumpkins and you know, they

30:28.780 --> 30:29.780
did that.

30:29.780 --> 30:32.740
And then you had these certain little mini achievements that you get the new banner,

30:32.740 --> 30:35.740
which I thought that was a pretty hefty reward because it's really hard and you have to play

30:35.740 --> 30:39.100
a lot to get a lot of those banners, but the Halloween challenge unlocks a banner.

30:39.100 --> 30:41.740
So I was like, Ooh, I want to get a banner for no particular reason.

30:41.740 --> 30:43.280
My E P needs it.

30:43.280 --> 30:44.280
So I did that.

30:44.280 --> 30:46.900
So, um, yeah, that was the Halloween challenge.

30:46.900 --> 30:49.420
Um, screw that Vanguard challenge though.

30:49.420 --> 30:53.060
I'm not doing that one cause I don't really like Vanguards as much as all my friends seem

30:53.060 --> 30:54.060
to.

30:54.060 --> 30:56.220
And that was really it for games.

30:56.220 --> 30:57.960
I didn't have a chance to play a lot of new stuff.

30:57.960 --> 31:02.600
I will say I took a trip to Dave and busters yesterday cause I was in the Bay area hanging

31:02.600 --> 31:08.280
with some of my friends and I went to Dave and busters and you know, I got to see like

31:08.280 --> 31:12.320
that infinity blade arcade machine, which I didn't really play it.

31:12.320 --> 31:16.320
You know, I didn't, Oh, this is the next next iPad.

31:16.320 --> 31:17.320
Yeah.

31:17.320 --> 31:18.320
Yeah.

31:18.320 --> 31:23.000
I'm, I'm too addicted to, um, the wheel of fortune, which, and the, it's the quiz game.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
It's that damn quiz game.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.640
I don't know if every Dave and busters has it, but it's like the giant quiz machine with

31:27.640 --> 31:28.640
the three buttons.

31:28.640 --> 31:31.120
Oh, we just sit there and play that for like an hour.

31:31.120 --> 31:38.160
Just keep putting the tickets in and, or the swipe in the card and um, I don't believe

31:38.160 --> 31:40.040
they have a DDR machine anymore.

31:40.040 --> 31:41.040
They didn't.

31:41.040 --> 31:42.040
Well, Dave and busters never did.

31:42.040 --> 31:46.160
They always only had pump it up, but they replaced it with a giant connect for machine.

31:46.160 --> 31:48.640
That's like, it's like, Oh my God, the thing is so bright.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.000
You can see it from space.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.240
It's crazy.

31:51.240 --> 31:53.720
So it's just connect for whatever.

31:53.720 --> 31:56.920
I think the one by S has an X two.

31:56.920 --> 31:57.920
Yeah.

31:57.920 --> 31:58.920
Yeah.

31:58.920 --> 32:00.600
They don't have pump.

32:00.600 --> 32:01.600
I don't think.

32:01.600 --> 32:02.600
Hmm.

32:02.600 --> 32:03.600
Interesting.

32:03.600 --> 32:04.600
But yeah, that was, that was really it for games.

32:04.600 --> 32:07.520
I didn't really, um, I have 11,000 tickets at Dave and busters though.

32:07.520 --> 32:12.000
I am really close to having enough for a PlayStation three game, a new one, although I almost bought

32:12.000 --> 32:15.160
Alan a new grill and an indoor grill yesterday because I could have got one of those for

32:15.160 --> 32:16.160
9,000 tickets.

32:16.160 --> 32:17.160
You know what?

32:17.160 --> 32:19.040
What I actually did use my tickets to buy appliances there.

32:19.040 --> 32:24.560
Did you, I got, um, a, uh, rice cooker that I actually used to make quinoa in and it's

32:24.560 --> 32:25.560
wonderful.

32:25.560 --> 32:26.560
Nice.

32:26.560 --> 32:28.560
Uh, Misty's asking me if this is the Dave and busters in Roseville.

32:28.560 --> 32:30.080
No, I actually went over to the Bay area.

32:30.080 --> 32:34.280
I went to the great mall in Milpitas cause we had to do outlet shopping cause I needed

32:34.280 --> 32:35.640
new shoes.

32:35.640 --> 32:37.120
But anyway, that's for another show.

32:37.120 --> 32:39.160
Uh, so that was my gaming week.

32:39.160 --> 32:40.360
Not a whole lot of new stuff.

32:40.360 --> 32:44.720
Just a lot of old classics, uh, debating, picking up halo four this week though.

32:44.720 --> 32:48.280
I got to admit, you know, I've skipped all the little halo side games.

32:48.280 --> 32:53.000
I bought original halo, halo two, halo three, skipped all the side games.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.720
Didn't think I'd buy halo four, but I don't know.

32:55.720 --> 32:57.760
There's a part of me that's four is pretty awesome.

32:57.760 --> 32:58.760
I don't want it.

32:58.760 --> 33:02.720
I mean, see, that's the same way as I only played three was the last one I played, but

33:02.720 --> 33:05.360
you got to figure, you know, reach in recon and all that stuff.

33:05.360 --> 33:09.360
Those kind of like prequels type, you know, that I don't really think you need to play

33:09.360 --> 33:13.320
that cause it's basically a sequel to three and if you play three then cool.

33:13.320 --> 33:14.320
Yeah.

33:14.320 --> 33:15.320
All right.

33:15.320 --> 33:16.320
Yes.

33:16.320 --> 33:17.560
Master chief wakes up after a long time.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.480
I mean, that's pretty much kind of, it depends.

33:19.480 --> 33:22.840
Well, a lot of it depends on what, what, what friends of mine are going to be playing halo

33:22.840 --> 33:27.520
four because halo two was the best because I played it with my college buddies that,

33:27.520 --> 33:30.000
you know, and this was a little bit after college and that game first came out and that

33:30.000 --> 33:33.520
was kind of a, we would have our night that we would all play halo two and it was just

33:33.520 --> 33:34.520
us, no strangers.

33:34.520 --> 33:38.200
And we had a great time when I went to halo three, that kind of fell apart.

33:38.200 --> 33:44.560
And so it was mostly strangers and halo three and I was kind of like, eh, eh, having my

33:44.560 --> 33:49.280
ass handed to me by strangers isn't as much fun as when it's people, you know, you know,

33:49.280 --> 33:55.720
uh, um, yeah, bonds bonds double six in our chat room says I just did halo one, two and

33:55.720 --> 33:57.840
three never did the ODST in wars.

33:57.840 --> 33:58.840
Yeah.

33:58.840 --> 33:59.840
Same.

33:59.840 --> 34:00.840
I'm in the same boat, buddy.

34:00.840 --> 34:02.840
Uh, Raginator asked kind of a random question.

34:02.840 --> 34:06.160
I'll answer this and then we'll go into, um, uh, housekeeping and news.

34:06.160 --> 34:11.440
Um, Raginator asks, Rob, say, have you ever used the games for windows marketplace before?

34:11.440 --> 34:15.440
I ask, cause I'm wondering if you can use Ms points on there or do you actually have

34:15.440 --> 34:17.240
to use actual dollars and cents?

34:17.240 --> 34:20.360
Um, maybe one of the other listeners can correct me.

34:20.360 --> 34:23.400
I believe it's all dollars and cents on the marketplace.

34:23.400 --> 34:25.940
I don't think they use the points.

34:25.940 --> 34:30.400
The only games for windows, if I did download it to get that free game tinker or whatever

34:30.400 --> 34:35.920
it was that was in there and when I was really into game room, you had to have games for

34:35.920 --> 34:39.640
windows for the games that you bought that played on both platforms.

34:39.640 --> 34:42.900
But that's really about my extent of knowledge of game for windows live.

34:42.900 --> 34:46.280
So I don't know how the points work there.

34:46.280 --> 34:50.680
I think Microsoft across the board is moving to regular currency.

34:50.680 --> 34:56.500
I don't think you see the Microsoft points in the windows eight marketplace for instance.

34:56.500 --> 35:00.000
So I think Microsoft transitioning away from that.

35:00.000 --> 35:04.460
Um, although bonds double a six says I have used the games for windows and they will use

35:04.460 --> 35:05.520
your Ms points.

35:05.520 --> 35:06.520
So maybe I'm wrong.

35:06.520 --> 35:08.840
I thought they were transitioning away from that though.

35:08.840 --> 35:13.020
So maybe it's one of those do it while you can.

35:13.020 --> 35:17.240
I'm sure though that if they do decide someday to just get rid of Microsoft points, they'll

35:17.240 --> 35:18.240
convert you.

35:18.240 --> 35:20.640
You can convert them somehow into like $80 to a dollar.

35:20.640 --> 35:21.600
Exactly.

35:21.600 --> 35:22.600
It won't be that difficult.

35:22.600 --> 35:25.040
So I wouldn't worry too much about it.

35:25.040 --> 35:26.040
Okay.

35:26.040 --> 35:30.200
Um, quick housekeeping and then we'll get into tonight's news.

35:30.200 --> 35:34.360
So um, we were going to have a interview tonight with Eddie from Bahmani style.

35:34.360 --> 35:35.880
He needed to postpone that.

35:35.880 --> 35:39.320
So if you did not see the message on Twitter, that interview will not be happening tonight.

35:39.320 --> 35:41.560
I apologize if you were tuning in just for that.

35:41.560 --> 35:43.440
I hope you'll enjoy the show anyway.

35:43.440 --> 35:44.560
We are going to reschedule that.

35:44.560 --> 35:46.320
I think we're doing it next week.

35:46.320 --> 35:48.360
Uh, keep an eye on our Twitter for updates.

35:48.360 --> 35:50.520
I will post as soon as I have that confirmed.

35:50.520 --> 35:54.000
Twitter.com slash O L R um, real life things happen.

35:54.000 --> 35:58.760
So at Eddie had to do something else tonight, but we will be welcoming him in a later week.

35:58.760 --> 36:03.360
Uh, the other housekeeping thing I want to mention, as we mentioned in part B last week,

36:03.360 --> 36:09.760
orange launch radio was nominated at the podcast awards, www.podcastawards.com for best gaming

36:09.760 --> 36:15.560
podcast and we're, we're going to try really hard not to spam this like crazy.

36:15.560 --> 36:17.880
We're limiting ourselves to once a day.

36:17.880 --> 36:20.240
We're trying to be tasteful about it.

36:20.240 --> 36:25.000
But you know, we really could use the support competition is going to be stiff, which, you

36:25.000 --> 36:31.360
know, the good news is it seems like the indie broadcasts are the ones that really want it.

36:31.360 --> 36:34.440
So an indie is probably going to win, which is great news.

36:34.440 --> 36:38.040
Um, you know, because the Corp cast, they're like, Oh, what's this?

36:38.040 --> 36:39.040
What's this little words?

36:39.040 --> 36:40.040
Oh, Oh, we have money elsewhere.

36:40.040 --> 36:43.080
Oh, we don't need to, so they don't even bother promoting it.

36:43.080 --> 36:46.760
But you know, the Indies are, are really, I'm trying to get the vote and hopefully that's

36:46.760 --> 36:48.680
a really good sign that one of them will win.

36:48.680 --> 36:52.880
Of course, we would love to be the ones that win because it's great exposure.

36:52.880 --> 36:56.640
And that's really, you know, why we're trying to get people to get out the vote for us because,

36:56.640 --> 36:59.520
you know, because we don't have those big websites behind us.

36:59.520 --> 37:01.500
We don't have a big marketing campaign.

37:01.500 --> 37:03.560
We don't make money off this show.

37:03.560 --> 37:06.880
It's just really a great way for us to leverage some promotion.

37:06.880 --> 37:13.480
So remember, you can vote once a day between now and November 15th, www.podcastawards.com

37:13.480 --> 37:15.560
and we are nominated in the best gaming category.

37:15.560 --> 37:19.580
Don't forget, if you give them an email address, that's not one that you often check.

37:19.580 --> 37:23.180
Be sure to check it once every 24 hours because you have to verify your vote because they

37:23.180 --> 37:25.220
want to make sure you're a real person.

37:25.220 --> 37:30.760
And please do not do anything that would get us disqualified by doing something shady.

37:30.760 --> 37:32.320
So keep it legit.

37:32.320 --> 37:33.920
Keep it real y'all.

37:33.920 --> 37:38.040
And most importantly, even if you're not going to vote for OLR, please consider keeping it

37:38.040 --> 37:41.080
indie because the indie podcasts need it.

37:41.080 --> 37:42.080
All right.

37:43.080 --> 37:44.880
What else do I want to say for housekeeping?

37:44.880 --> 37:48.440
Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio and Google Plus.

37:48.440 --> 37:49.440
We're on there as well.

37:49.440 --> 37:52.600
Please join our communities on there.

37:52.600 --> 37:58.120
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Launch Radio on vognetwork.com,

37:58.120 --> 38:00.800
use the passphrase, random.

38:00.800 --> 38:02.200
Let's get into some gaming news.

38:02.200 --> 38:03.720
Loki, start us off.

38:03.720 --> 38:04.800
All right.

38:04.800 --> 38:08.560
So let's talk a little bit about 38 Studios.

38:08.560 --> 38:13.800
I know everyone's familiar with the whole debacle with, you know, kingdoms of Amalur

38:13.800 --> 38:15.440
reckoning and all that stuff.

38:15.440 --> 38:23.640
Well now apparently the people that were behind the whole $75 million loan for 38 Studios

38:23.640 --> 38:28.120
are being sued by Rhode Island.

38:28.120 --> 38:29.480
And it's kind of interesting.

38:29.480 --> 38:33.160
So they're actually going after, what was it?

38:33.160 --> 38:42.040
It was, you know, Kurt Schilling and CEO Jennifer McLean.

38:42.040 --> 38:50.840
And I guess also the former Economic Development Corporation Director Keith Stokes and Wells

38:50.840 --> 38:55.080
Fargo Securities and Barclays Capital.

38:55.080 --> 38:57.360
So Barclays used to own the company I worked for.

38:57.360 --> 38:58.360
Yeah.

38:58.360 --> 38:59.360
So they're going after them.

38:59.360 --> 39:04.280
And they said, you know, I know you work hard for your paychecks and for your tax dollars

39:04.280 --> 39:06.760
to be squandered is unacceptable.

39:06.760 --> 39:11.320
The board's legal action was taken to rectify this grave injustice put upon the people of

39:11.320 --> 39:13.120
Rhode Island.

39:13.120 --> 39:15.400
And so, yeah.

39:15.400 --> 39:17.640
So they're going after them for money.

39:17.640 --> 39:22.880
And I don't know, hopefully they get it.

39:22.880 --> 39:24.880
It's be interesting.

39:24.880 --> 39:28.560
They're just trying to kind of recoup any losses that they had because they're out sending

39:28.560 --> 39:29.960
$75 million right now.

39:29.960 --> 39:34.080
You know, I'm not going to pretend to know the first thing about investment or like how

39:34.080 --> 39:37.560
the money worked out in this whole mess.

39:37.560 --> 39:42.040
So I am not going to be one of those pundits that's like, yeah, take them through the ring

39:42.040 --> 39:45.440
or get them through all their worth or, you know, or the other extreme, because I really

39:45.440 --> 39:47.080
just don't know.

39:47.080 --> 39:52.880
I just find this shit fascinating that, you know, the state of Rhode Island is out this

39:52.880 --> 39:53.880
money.

39:53.880 --> 39:56.200
It's not some private company.

39:57.000 --> 40:04.240
The state is out a large amount of money because of the failure of a video game company.

40:04.240 --> 40:06.760
That just kind of blows my mind in a way.

40:06.760 --> 40:11.580
It's really unfortunate because it would probably make people hesitant to invest in other video

40:11.580 --> 40:12.580
game companies.

40:12.580 --> 40:17.840
But I don't know, it just blows my mind.

40:17.840 --> 40:21.000
The Rob D in chat says, Kurt Schilling will need to sell everything.

40:21.000 --> 40:24.280
I feel bad for everyone involved.

40:24.280 --> 40:26.560
Mack Deft follows that up with yeah.

40:26.560 --> 40:32.080
And the Rob D follows that up at live.vognetwork.com says Kurt Schilling was an idiot, but he

40:32.080 --> 40:34.440
didn't have evil intentions.

40:34.440 --> 40:38.100
Dark Sakura followed that up with he'll need to sell $10 blow jobs.

40:38.100 --> 40:39.100
Don't be immature.

40:39.100 --> 40:40.100
Don't be immature.

40:40.100 --> 40:41.100
Exactly.

40:41.100 --> 40:45.200
To recoup those kind of losses, he's going to have to sell $100 blow jobs.

40:45.200 --> 40:50.080
Well, I was just thinking $10 so that he'd actually get business.

40:50.080 --> 40:55.240
The Rob D, again, some good comments in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says he has

40:55.240 --> 40:57.880
to pay for his idiocy though.

40:57.880 --> 41:01.040
Actions have consequences.

41:01.040 --> 41:04.560
Kurt Schilling was just trying to make a video game that ever, I mean, obviously he was a

41:04.560 --> 41:06.900
big EverQuest fan, a big WoW fan.

41:06.900 --> 41:11.120
He wanted to make that game, but probably, I mean, let's be real.

41:11.120 --> 41:12.840
He was a baseball player.

41:12.840 --> 41:16.560
He probably didn't really know what he was getting into.

41:16.560 --> 41:19.760
I mean, it's kind of sad.

41:19.760 --> 41:25.160
I don't think the game was that bad, but the thing is, it's just not a lot of games do.

41:25.160 --> 41:30.360
Millions and millions of copies sold and to just count on your game being like a tent

41:30.360 --> 41:34.040
pool AAA title, it's huge, huge, huge, huge.

41:34.040 --> 41:36.380
It's not really realistic.

41:36.380 --> 41:41.000
But the whole thing, all that being said, it blows my fucking mind that he was given

41:41.000 --> 41:42.760
the money in the first place.

41:42.760 --> 41:47.560
Because somebody wrote him that check.

41:47.560 --> 41:49.920
Is it because of the sports fame?

41:49.920 --> 41:54.680
Is it because we're so fixated on sports in this country that it's like, oh yeah, when

41:54.680 --> 41:58.680
sports royalty walks in and wants to do something, we let them do it.

41:58.680 --> 42:00.360
Is that what's to blame?

42:00.360 --> 42:02.960
Is that sports royalty in our culture?

42:02.960 --> 42:08.640
I'm pretty sure that in certain counties in California, like Hollywood and stuff like

42:08.640 --> 42:10.760
that, you could probably kill a man and get away with it.

42:10.760 --> 42:13.680
They give you a gimme and you know, that's it.

42:13.680 --> 42:16.400
But so like, you know, it works for it works for OJ.

42:16.400 --> 42:17.400
Yeah.

42:17.400 --> 42:18.400
Say five million dollar loan.

42:18.400 --> 42:21.600
I mean, that's that's like, ah, you're good for it.

42:21.600 --> 42:24.640
You're a baseball star right now.

42:24.640 --> 42:29.480
You know, there's no possible way we're going to lose on this.

42:29.480 --> 42:32.240
S.H.O. 100 Matt in our chat says it was because he was Curt Schilling.

42:32.240 --> 42:33.980
So you're saying I'm right?

42:33.980 --> 42:34.980
Question mark.

42:34.980 --> 42:40.240
Well, keep in mind, this is the same country that's letting a, you know, a convicted rapist

42:40.240 --> 42:49.580
go free, you know, and is the director, the movie director, I what?

42:49.580 --> 42:53.040
Nevermind that Paul W.S. Anderson, I swear.

42:53.040 --> 42:55.120
All right.

42:55.120 --> 42:58.200
And Tiger Cloth follows it up saying, yeah, it's got to be because he was a baseball player

42:58.200 --> 43:01.560
and the fact he was a World Series winning baseball player.

43:01.560 --> 43:07.420
So anyhow, let's just like no one give like, you know, basketball stars this kind of money

43:07.420 --> 43:12.260
either for game ideas, because would they have given that money to Dennis Rodman?

43:12.260 --> 43:13.660
We did have Shaq Fu.

43:13.660 --> 43:22.300
Hey, I wonder if Shaq Fu sold as many copies, if not more copies, then, uh, yeah, at least

43:22.300 --> 43:24.060
Shaq Fu recovered its costs.

43:24.060 --> 43:26.180
Maybe Shaq Fu is a concept I can get behind.

43:26.180 --> 43:29.460
Shaq Fu did not put Rhode Island seventy five million dollars.

43:29.460 --> 43:31.340
Shaq Fu is harmless.

43:31.340 --> 43:32.820
Well, pretty harmless.

43:32.820 --> 43:36.460
Shaq Fu just put me seventy five minutes of my time into debt.

43:36.460 --> 43:37.460
That's all.

43:37.460 --> 43:39.060
It's not as big of a loss.

43:39.060 --> 43:42.620
Oh, I remember the game I wanted to talk about during my gaming week before we get into this

43:42.620 --> 43:44.860
next thing, since we're talking about basketball.

43:44.860 --> 43:46.500
Do you know what I saw at the mall?

43:46.500 --> 43:49.680
A demo kiosk for NBA baller beats.

43:49.680 --> 43:51.900
And I so badly, that looked awkward.

43:51.900 --> 43:56.100
I so badly wanted to play it, but I was with my friend Victoria and she was judging me

43:56.100 --> 43:57.100
so hard.

43:57.100 --> 43:58.100
Listen, you're too white for this.

43:58.100 --> 43:59.280
You're too white for this.

43:59.280 --> 44:00.700
You're not going to do that.

44:00.700 --> 44:01.700
Basically.

44:01.700 --> 44:04.780
And thanks to SSJ100 Matt, it was Roman Pileski.

44:04.780 --> 44:07.140
Oh, that whole thing.

44:07.140 --> 44:08.140
Oh, yeah.

44:08.140 --> 44:10.620
That's that's a bit of a mess, isn't it?

44:10.620 --> 44:17.220
Anyhow, NBA baller beats, I got to say, say what you will say what you would judge me

44:17.220 --> 44:18.220
all you want.

44:18.220 --> 44:20.280
I don't give a fuck.

44:20.280 --> 44:21.280
It looked fun.

44:21.280 --> 44:22.280
I'm sorry.

44:22.280 --> 44:24.500
It looked fun.

44:24.500 --> 44:33.420
I can get my boss to give me the copy that we have because it's just sitting there on

44:33.420 --> 44:34.420
his desk.

44:34.420 --> 44:35.620
I'm not going to lie.

44:35.620 --> 44:37.900
I'm just waiting for it to go in the clearance bin.

44:37.900 --> 44:40.060
I'm going to check much longer.

44:40.060 --> 44:41.740
I'm going to check fries once a week.

44:41.740 --> 44:44.260
It'll be a manager special before we know it.

44:44.260 --> 44:49.940
They even have them for sale there like, nope, nope, nope.

44:49.940 --> 44:50.940
All right.

44:50.940 --> 44:51.940
Moving on.

44:51.940 --> 44:54.140
Rhode Island's not the only one that's lost money.

44:54.140 --> 45:00.700
Sony talking about their finances made a net loss of fifteen point five billion yen.

45:00.700 --> 45:06.180
That translates to just under two hundred million dollars in their second fiscal quarter.

45:06.180 --> 45:09.980
Their gaming division has seen a year on year decline in profit.

45:09.980 --> 45:14.180
This is a year on year reduction in loss of forty two point six percent.

45:14.180 --> 45:17.500
That's an improvement over the three hundred and twelve million dollars they lost during

45:17.500 --> 45:20.700
the first quarter.

45:20.700 --> 45:25.700
The company is lowered their projections for the end of the year for the PSP and the Vita

45:25.700 --> 45:27.740
sales significantly.

45:27.740 --> 45:30.140
That's down to ten million from what they originally projected.

45:30.140 --> 45:34.380
I don't think they're going to come out too well this year, to be honest.

45:34.380 --> 45:39.500
Kaz Hirai in May indicated a fiscal year estimate of ten million for the Vita alone.

45:39.500 --> 45:44.920
The PS3 and the PS2 combined estimate remains untouched at sixteen million.

45:44.920 --> 45:50.720
On the bright side, software performance saw slight growth across the second quarter.

45:50.720 --> 45:53.660
So the PS3 and PS2 sales, they've actually rose slightly.

45:53.660 --> 45:56.420
Well, let me just look at the fourth quarter line.

45:56.420 --> 45:58.220
They don't really have any strong titles.

45:58.220 --> 46:01.060
They have PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, which could flop.

46:01.060 --> 46:05.640
I mean, it's all right, but it's not going to be like, you know, Uncharted or something

46:05.640 --> 46:06.700
like that.

46:06.700 --> 46:09.540
And they've got Little Big Planet Karting, which also could flop.

46:09.540 --> 46:14.340
I mean, those are both like kind of mediocre, you know, as far as like Triple A titles go,

46:14.340 --> 46:17.500
they're not like Mass Effect or Halo.

46:17.500 --> 46:21.720
It's just kind of like, huh, you know, they'll do all right, but they're not going to be

46:21.720 --> 46:25.840
these huge games that people are like, oh, my God, I'm going to line up at midnight to

46:25.840 --> 46:28.400
go get my PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale.

46:28.400 --> 46:29.400
That's a very good point.

46:29.400 --> 46:30.400
That's a very good point.

46:30.400 --> 46:34.780
These games are not Halo 4 or like that was that they have the new Sly Cooper game, Thieves

46:34.780 --> 46:38.760
in Time around and one of those anyways.

46:38.760 --> 46:40.360
So those aren't really that strong titles.

46:40.360 --> 46:43.280
And look at what we have for the Vita, like the two big games that they've been kind of

46:43.280 --> 46:47.880
pimping for the Vita was Call of Duty, Black Ops Classified, which I'm afraid is going

46:47.880 --> 46:48.880
to suck.

46:48.880 --> 46:52.020
In fact, I'm pretty sure it's going to suck because the guys that made it were the guys

46:52.020 --> 46:56.380
that made the really shitty Resistance game that they were also pimping out really hard

46:56.380 --> 47:01.420
and was very mediocre in Assassin's Creed, which I think Assassin's Creed Liberation

47:01.420 --> 47:02.420
is actually pretty good.

47:02.420 --> 47:06.820
But the Call of Duty game, the one that they're kind of banking on, you know, selling the

47:06.820 --> 47:09.420
Vita, they even have bundles for it and stuff.

47:09.420 --> 47:11.420
It's just it's going to be mediocre.

47:11.420 --> 47:13.740
It's going to get poor reviews.

47:13.740 --> 47:15.620
Here's the thing.

47:15.620 --> 47:20.460
If Sony is losing this money and Sony is not really selling Vitas like they thought they

47:20.460 --> 47:24.740
would, do we really think we're going to get a PlayStation 4 next year?

47:24.740 --> 47:26.900
Do we still think that's something that's going to happen?

47:26.900 --> 47:31.980
Because I'm I'm really starting to think a lot of this stuff that we're hearing about

47:31.980 --> 47:35.100
game industry troubles, because this is not the first we've heard of this.

47:35.100 --> 47:37.800
We've heard about layoffs, et cetera, et cetera.

47:37.800 --> 47:42.580
Could this have the domino effect of maybe not having a new system or do it?

47:42.580 --> 47:45.540
Does it make it more urgent that we need a new system to get us out?

47:45.540 --> 47:49.980
I think if anything, I think we're going to have probably a new system soon, like as soon

47:50.020 --> 47:53.860
as at the end of next year, because that's why we're seeing this kind of development

47:53.860 --> 47:54.860
cycle.

47:54.860 --> 47:58.720
We are seeing, you know, these games that are they're all right, but they're not like

47:58.720 --> 48:02.380
these big, you know, launch tentpole titles or something like that.

48:02.380 --> 48:03.380
It's like a new uncharted.

48:03.380 --> 48:08.380
I mean, they have a new uncharted last year, but it's not like a big, huge title like that.

48:08.380 --> 48:13.660
I think that they're having these dev teams working on something for the next system.

48:13.660 --> 48:18.600
So they have a strong launch because they know they need that.

48:18.600 --> 48:19.600
It's hard to say that.

48:19.720 --> 48:23.880
I think that they're going to have to probably drop the price of the Vita pretty soon, because

48:23.880 --> 48:26.720
there's not a whole ton of stuff that's really like a selling point.

48:26.720 --> 48:30.520
Like had I not gotten one, there's not really anything that would have sold me on one.

48:30.520 --> 48:34.120
Although if they announce a portable Grand Theft Auto 5 game, I'm probably going to have

48:34.120 --> 48:35.400
to buy that.

48:35.400 --> 48:37.080
Any Grand Theft Auto game, I probably have to buy.

48:37.080 --> 48:39.280
I don't really care what system it's on.

48:39.280 --> 48:43.340
YYYR in our chat room says, I played LittleBigPlanet Karting in New York Comic Con.

48:43.340 --> 48:44.340
There were no lines.

48:44.340 --> 48:48.840
It was actually quite fun, but I walked away thinking, will I pay $60 for this?

48:48.840 --> 48:49.840
No.

48:49.840 --> 48:54.800
Rob D says at live.vognetwork.com, we absolutely need a new system.

48:54.800 --> 48:57.360
That said, we also need to reevaluate the game industry.

48:57.360 --> 49:01.340
The problem is that companies only change things up when we get new systems.

49:01.340 --> 49:04.700
You know, that's kind of along the same line I'm thinking of.

49:04.700 --> 49:08.740
Not so much that we absolutely need a new system, but the whole, I don't know, I kind

49:08.740 --> 49:12.640
of think the PS3's potential hasn't really been realized.

49:12.640 --> 49:18.000
Because the PS3 does 3D gaming, but is that really a thing that people are doing right

49:18.000 --> 49:19.000
now?

49:19.000 --> 49:20.000
No.

49:20.000 --> 49:22.680
So what is the PS4 going to bring us that the PS3's not doing?

49:22.680 --> 49:25.840
You have to understand, they've already kind of gotten away from trying to promote 3D as

49:25.840 --> 49:26.840
like a big thing now.

49:26.840 --> 49:29.520
It's like they don't even really mention it too much anymore.

49:29.520 --> 49:33.280
And even with 3D TVs, people aren't really sold on 3D TVs, so now they're pushing that

49:33.280 --> 49:36.920
whole 4K, you know, the Ultra HD TV.

49:36.920 --> 49:39.760
So is that going to be the PlayStation 4's big thing?

49:39.760 --> 49:40.760
Yeah, they want.

49:40.760 --> 49:41.760
Ultra HD?

49:41.760 --> 49:42.760
Yeah.

49:42.760 --> 49:46.040
I think that was one of the rumored specs, is it was going to do that 4K resolution thing.

49:46.080 --> 49:51.280
But if the PlayStation 3 couldn't get people to adopt 3D successfully, although, okay,

49:51.280 --> 49:57.400
to be fair, to be fair, Blu-ray probably won in large part to the PlayStation 3.

49:57.400 --> 49:58.400
Yeah.

49:58.400 --> 49:59.400
Yeah.

49:59.400 --> 50:04.040
So, I mean, for every maybe failure, you could say that there's been a win, but I'm just

50:04.040 --> 50:08.360
not convinced that like people are going to be like, oh, I need this PlayStation 4 right

50:08.360 --> 50:09.360
fucking now.

50:09.360 --> 50:16.240
Oh, and I need a new Sony Ultra HD TV as well to play what?

50:16.240 --> 50:20.440
Because you can think that any games that are coming out at launch are probably just

50:20.440 --> 50:25.880
going to be, they're probably not going to be utilizing that.

50:25.880 --> 50:27.720
One more, let me do one more comment here from chat.

50:27.720 --> 50:29.440
The chat's got a lot of good points tonight.

50:29.440 --> 50:34.160
YYR says, I really think that smartphones and the sort of success of the 3DS have killed

50:34.160 --> 50:35.920
the Vita's potential market.

50:35.960 --> 50:39.600
I really think it's a great system and I'm really enjoying the game library despite its

50:39.600 --> 50:40.600
small size.

50:40.600 --> 50:45.840
But how many people want one if they have smartphones, a 3DS or both?

50:45.840 --> 50:47.720
I don't even touch my DS at all.

50:47.720 --> 50:49.200
I play on my phone.

50:49.200 --> 50:51.920
You know, I would argue that the 3DS is kind of hurting too.

50:51.920 --> 50:54.640
I mean, we're hearing a very similar story out of Nintendo.

50:54.640 --> 50:59.520
It might not be as dire, but Nintendo's lowered expectations of 3DS sales as well.

50:59.520 --> 51:05.900
So, but I do think you're onto something that a lot of it has to do with tablets, smart

51:05.900 --> 51:11.580
phones, which is why when you bring out your device and you say it plays Netflix, like

51:11.580 --> 51:14.300
that was a waste of breath.

51:14.300 --> 51:21.820
The fact that your device, Wii U, plays Netflix is like, that's, that's an expectation now.

51:21.820 --> 51:25.780
That's like, that's as much of an expectation of it does widescreen.

51:25.780 --> 51:27.580
It does HD.

51:27.580 --> 51:28.980
It does Netflix.

51:28.980 --> 51:30.900
That's like a baseline thing now.

51:30.900 --> 51:40.580
So what makes your device better than a tablet or a smartphone that, you know, far more people

51:40.580 --> 51:42.220
have in their pockets and so forth?

51:42.220 --> 51:45.060
I think that's a big part of it too.

51:45.060 --> 51:48.100
iPad mini ain't gonna help.

51:48.100 --> 51:49.100
I can be honest.

51:49.100 --> 51:56.700
I mean, like I've got a smartphone and I have an iPod touch, you know, 4G and I don't really

51:56.700 --> 51:59.860
use either of them for gaming.

51:59.860 --> 52:00.860
Just don't.

52:00.860 --> 52:04.780
Even like my portable systems, I'm kind of reevaluating whether I even need portable

52:04.780 --> 52:07.700
gaming systems because I don't travel that much.

52:07.700 --> 52:11.220
I don't really play portable games on it.

52:11.220 --> 52:15.700
I mean, granted, you know, they're, they're talking about getting rid of our game room

52:15.700 --> 52:20.540
again because they're consolidating space and buildings and stuff, so they can lease

52:20.540 --> 52:21.540
out the other building.

52:21.540 --> 52:27.500
But you know, we used to play on the PSP because it was portable and we could get a group of

52:27.500 --> 52:30.300
people together and play Grand Theft Auto and stuff.

52:30.300 --> 52:35.900
So you know, that may be a case where, yeah, I'd want a system like that to play like,

52:35.900 --> 52:40.140
you know, Grand Theft Auto or some multiplayer game so that we can kind of move around and

52:40.140 --> 52:42.860
stuff, be a little bit nomadic.

52:42.860 --> 52:48.260
But I, it's just, I don't find the need to have that stuff anymore, it seems like.

52:48.260 --> 52:53.460
Even like with all the systems, I don't really feel the need next generation to own all of

52:53.460 --> 52:54.460
the systems.

52:54.460 --> 52:57.900
I mean, granted, that's just be, you know, even before it felt like kind of this expectation

52:57.900 --> 53:00.260
because I do this show, oh, I should own all of them.

53:00.260 --> 53:03.780
I'm not really feeling it anymore because I don't play the Wii at all.

53:03.780 --> 53:07.300
The Wii is literally collecting dust, I have something stacked on top of it and that was

53:07.300 --> 53:08.300
it.

53:08.300 --> 53:12.100
We, you know, we dusted off the other day just to play Sight Truck, I should say my

53:12.100 --> 53:13.220
wife did.

53:13.220 --> 53:17.980
But like I haven't played anything on that for years now.

53:17.980 --> 53:22.540
And the PlayStation 3, same thing, like we're looking at maybe using the PlayStation 3 for

53:22.540 --> 53:26.000
Grand Theft Auto 5 because it doesn't get disconnected through our firewalls quick,

53:26.000 --> 53:30.840
but I haven't played anything on that for like a long time.

53:30.840 --> 53:33.080
Jamie, quick thought.

53:33.080 --> 53:37.140
Well, I was just saying I haven't really, I mean, Dan and I have actually talked about

53:37.140 --> 53:43.400
downsizing our collection, you know, because really it's anything that we've wanted to

53:43.400 --> 53:50.520
play, I can get on my PC and I can upgrade my PC at any point.

53:50.520 --> 53:54.320
It just really isn't, you know.

53:54.320 --> 53:59.160
And the other thing too is also looking in terms of the economy, people I think, this

53:59.160 --> 54:04.040
has been the case for us, are really looking at needs versus wants.

54:04.040 --> 54:07.760
A gaming system is a want, it's not something you need.

54:07.760 --> 54:13.040
We need to pay rent and that became the priority, you know.

54:13.040 --> 54:16.080
I didn't have, I wasn't working at the time.

54:16.080 --> 54:20.800
Any of my money couldn't go towards games, it went towards buying food, paying bills,

54:20.800 --> 54:21.800
you know.

54:21.800 --> 54:22.800
And in this case-

54:22.800 --> 54:23.800
Damn responsibility, damn it.

54:24.280 --> 54:28.880
Well, yeah, but if you look at it, the vast majority of people have been put into the

54:28.880 --> 54:33.680
circumstances instead of having disposable income, they're realizing that, yeah, maybe

54:33.680 --> 54:35.120
I don't need this stuff.

54:35.120 --> 54:37.280
Maybe it's just a bonus.

54:37.280 --> 54:38.720
Let me read a few more comments from chat.

54:38.720 --> 54:43.320
We'll end on these chat comments and go on into Dark Sakura's next story, but there's

54:43.320 --> 54:44.960
such a good discussion going on in chat tonight.

54:44.960 --> 54:47.960
I just got to throw these out there for the podcast listeners to hear.

54:47.960 --> 54:52.640
YYR says, the 3DS can also fall back on Nintendo's excellent software.

54:52.640 --> 54:54.120
Don't forget Pokemon.

54:54.120 --> 54:58.920
We haven't really had, the Pokemon games just came out or for the last DS, which is fascinating.

54:58.920 --> 55:01.960
That's how confident that they were that those games are going to do well in the 3DS.

55:01.960 --> 55:03.800
And they're probably right, to be fair.

55:03.800 --> 55:08.240
Dungeon Buster says, Sony's definitely thinking ahead to make the hardware flexible enough

55:08.240 --> 55:14.280
to adapt to what the next technologies might be, 8K televisions, virtual glasses, et cetera.

55:14.280 --> 55:18.060
Though most of the concepts are high up there, some techies are suggesting that the next

55:18.060 --> 55:23.700
PlayStation 4 might even use through silicon via for the processor architecture.

55:23.700 --> 55:27.220
I'm not sure, I think I butchered that sentence there, but you know, just the whole thinking

55:27.220 --> 55:28.220
ahead point.

55:28.220 --> 55:33.300
And lastly, Doom Plague says, I would be surprised if anyone made a 4K resolution game in the

55:33.300 --> 55:34.820
next 10 years.

55:34.820 --> 55:37.860
It's a non-factor this coming generation.

55:37.860 --> 55:43.000
All right, we could talk about this for a lot longer, but I think this discussion is

55:43.000 --> 55:47.480
going to be continuing through the next six months, right on up to the next E3, when we

55:47.480 --> 55:51.240
know what these systems, if they're coming at all for one, and what they will entail.

55:51.240 --> 55:53.600
In the meantime, let's go to Dark Soccer with the next story.

55:53.600 --> 55:57.200
How about a tale of some corporate fucking greed?

55:57.200 --> 56:00.600
Yay!

56:00.600 --> 56:06.600
Frank Christopher Oliveira, who is the former GameStop VP of Corporate Communications and

56:06.600 --> 56:13.640
Public Affairs, got caught, pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud for embezzling

56:13.640 --> 56:19.080
$1,965,900 from GameStop.

56:19.080 --> 56:25.440
And in the indictment, he sent payments from January 2009 through April 2011 to Cloud Communications

56:25.440 --> 56:33.080
LLC, which was a fictitious company he owned, to transfer funds into his personal account.

56:33.080 --> 56:39.820
So yeah, basically GameStop is like no comment, however they are fully cooperating with the

56:39.820 --> 56:42.560
federal investigation.

56:42.560 --> 56:48.480
And yeah, he actually, he pleaded not guilty, and the max sentence to this is 20 years in

56:48.480 --> 56:52.240
prison and $250,000 fine.

56:52.240 --> 56:56.440
And I hope that he gets the max, you know, penalty.

56:56.440 --> 57:01.580
I wish that all of these corporate bastards who steal money from the companies they work

57:01.580 --> 57:07.580
for and get away with, you know, fraud and stealing money out of the consumer's pockets

57:07.580 --> 57:12.400
get caught too, instead of being given, you know, personhood and all this bullshit.

57:12.400 --> 57:13.720
That's what I'm saying.

57:13.720 --> 57:15.200
People need to be held accountable.

57:15.200 --> 57:20.020
Funny enough, it would only take capturing about, what, about 35 more guys like this

57:20.020 --> 57:23.120
guy for Rhode Island to get their money back.

57:23.120 --> 57:24.440
Yeah.

57:24.440 --> 57:32.160
It's just another, another sign of how, you know, people in positions of power and companies

57:32.160 --> 57:35.400
are really abusing their positions.

57:35.400 --> 57:40.560
And in return, you know, who has to pay for, you know, recouping those losses?

57:40.560 --> 57:43.420
It goes back to the consumer when they're figuring out their money's missing.

57:43.420 --> 57:47.540
Rama makes a very tongue-in-cheek comment in our chat room, but it's worth repeating.

57:47.540 --> 57:48.540
Steal from GameStop?

57:48.540 --> 57:50.800
Sure, they've stolen from me enough times.

57:50.800 --> 57:57.280
Yeah, but this is, you know, a guy who probably already is a millionaire.

57:57.280 --> 58:02.780
You have to remember, this is a guy who was feeding money that they already got from you

58:02.780 --> 58:05.560
into these fake companies and what have you.

58:05.560 --> 58:06.560
Yeah.

58:06.560 --> 58:07.560
It's just amazing.

58:07.560 --> 58:08.640
He was able to do that much.

58:08.640 --> 58:10.480
I want them to nail his ass to the wall.

58:10.480 --> 58:15.600
I, I want these, and it goes back to a bigger problem.

58:15.600 --> 58:22.000
It goes back, you know, to more people looking at their own personal greed as opposed to,

58:22.000 --> 58:23.560
you know, being a better person maybe.

58:23.560 --> 58:25.360
Are you saying look at your life, look at your choices?

58:25.360 --> 58:27.440
Yeah, look at your life, look at your choices.

58:27.440 --> 58:28.440
Don't be a corporate douche-head.

58:28.440 --> 58:29.440
All right.

58:29.440 --> 58:30.440
Fair enough.

58:30.440 --> 58:32.440
Loki, let's move on.

58:32.440 --> 58:33.440
All right.

58:33.440 --> 58:38.060
Um, so let's talk a little bit about one game I'm very looking forward to, and that would

58:38.060 --> 58:39.680
be Grand Theft Auto V.

58:39.680 --> 58:40.680
And of course-

58:40.680 --> 58:42.680
Since when were you a Grand Theft Auto fan?

58:42.680 --> 58:43.680
I know, I just-

58:43.680 --> 58:45.200
You're just getting on the bandwagon.

58:45.200 --> 58:47.480
It's been a long time.

58:47.480 --> 58:52.040
But I'm gearing up because this month is going to be a lot of news for Grand Theft Auto V.

58:52.040 --> 58:54.800
I bet you suddenly became a Giants fan last week too.

58:54.800 --> 58:59.240
Yeah, I had to become a sports fan first, and so that's not going to happen.

58:59.240 --> 59:02.680
Grand Theft Auto V, of course, there was a whole bunch of rumors of when it is expected

59:02.680 --> 59:03.680
to come out.

59:03.680 --> 59:06.340
I've already said that it's going to be April and May next year, but they've officially

59:06.340 --> 59:10.020
confirmed that yes, Spring 2003 is going to be the release window for the game, and

59:10.020 --> 59:16.780
they added some promotional materials that are making it out to GameStops and other places,

59:16.780 --> 59:19.620
including game and stuff internationally.

59:19.620 --> 59:26.140
And along with that, some of the promotional stuff, starting on Monday, November 5th, you

59:26.140 --> 59:29.980
can actually pre-order the game from different locations.

59:29.980 --> 59:34.420
The rumor was that they were supposed to be doing another trailer on the 5th, although

59:34.420 --> 59:38.940
because of the whole hurricane slash storm, it's put them a little bit behind as far as

59:38.940 --> 59:44.140
getting that trailer cut, so expect the trailer next week, which I'm really expecting for

59:44.140 --> 59:45.260
next week.

59:45.260 --> 59:50.700
And they've got some cool little promotional items if you're able to pre-order your game

59:50.700 --> 59:54.180
early enough, because it's going to be extremely limited in supplies.

59:54.180 --> 59:57.820
You can get a keychain type thing that has almost like a little viewfinder on there,

59:57.820 --> 01:00:02.540
and you can check out some of the locations, including they've got Vinewood Hills, which

01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:13.580
is like Hollywood, the Del Perro Pier, like Santa Monica, the Vespucci Canals, I guess

01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:17.100
that's, looks like kind of like a downtown LA.

01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:18.380
Sounds a little dirty.

01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:21.980
Grapeseed, which is kind of like Napa.

01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:23.700
Oh boy.

01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:24.700
So it looks interesting.

01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:25.700
I mean, they kind of show some-

01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:26.940
Because Napa's so close to LA.

01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:32.260
Whatever, you know, it's just like, well, San Andreas, they had San Francisco, Vegas,

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:35.420
and you know, I know, I know, it's a video game.

01:00:35.420 --> 01:00:36.420
It's all fixed.

01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:37.420
It's all fictitious anyways.

01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:38.420
Right, right.

01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:42.020
And then they've got new posters and stuff like that with like a Lindsay Lohan looking

01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:47.140
woman on the front there, prostitute, I don't know, it's hard to tell what, which it is.

01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:52.700
So yeah, it's pretty awesome, and hopefully we'll learn a little bit, well, definitely

01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:57.100
a lot more this month, because it's the cover game for the new Game Informer, which is gonna

01:00:57.100 --> 01:01:01.900
be the December issue, which is coming out in any time now, like a couple weeks, and

01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:08.620
also kind of their launch of their whole media campaign, so very excited.

01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:11.620
Trying to take your mind off of some of the holiday games that are coming out right now.

01:01:11.620 --> 01:01:13.260
I'm looking forward to spring.

01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:16.420
Well, I'm only picking, the last game I'm picking up this, well, actually I should say

01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:19.380
not the last game, but the second to last game I'm picking up this year is Black Ops

01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:25.300
2, followed by Far Cry 3, so those would be the last two games I'm getting, and then maybe

01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:27.260
Halo 4, I don't know, we'll see.

01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:31.340
Well there are gonna be a lot of people picking up Halo 4 this week, believe it or not, it's

01:01:31.340 --> 01:01:35.180
here, because, you know, the election day is this week, and it's the same day Halo 4

01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:39.940
is being released, and retailers everywhere are gonna be doing midnight releases, Game

01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:44.760
Stop is one of those retailers, they did announce this week 4,400 of their US locations will

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:48.500
be open at midnight to sell Halo 4.

01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:52.620
All the stores that are participating in the event will start their events at 9 o'clock

01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:54.540
in the local time zone.

01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:59.440
Do keep in mind, if you're in an area that was impacted by Hurricane Sandy, that may

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:03.120
have screwed up some of these Game Stops, there's still a lot of places without power,

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:07.900
so when in doubt, call ahead, and just make sure.

01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:12.480
Probably if your store did Assassin's Creed 3, it's probably doing Halo 4, but you know,

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:15.440
it's always best to just call ahead, there's nothing wrong with placing a phone call.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:20.140
The store that you've pre-ordered your game happens to be a plan trade, you're not getting

01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:21.140
it at midnight.

01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:27.160
Alrighty then, well, I do want to point out, you know, even though Game Stop, they're most,

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:30.880
there's probably a shit ton of other retailers doing the midnight release as well.

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:37.560
I'm sure Walmarts, Best Buys, probably, you know, basically any place that sells video

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:43.320
games will probably be open at midnight, because Halo 4 is kind of a big deal.

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:48.640
Now, one other thing I want to talk about with Halo 4, is this interesting little report

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:55.380
that's going around the internet this week, 343 Industries apparently not happy with some

01:02:55.380 --> 01:03:01.220
of the language that players use when they're playing Halo, to which I say, good, make the

01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:03.540
shit talkers take some accountability.

01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:09.500
The studio head of 343 Industries, Bonnie Ross, in an interview with GameSpot said,

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:14.380
quote, I've seen many of the sites that have documented some of the more gender-specific,

01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:16.060
slanderous comments.

01:03:16.060 --> 01:03:20.420
This is behavior that is offensive and completely unacceptable.

01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:25.420
I'd like to think most of our Xbox Live players don't support this kind of behavior.

01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:29.300
What are you laughing about out of there?

01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:30.900
Just like most of them.

01:03:34.540 --> 01:03:39.900
Executive producer, Kiki Wolfkill said that when the best name ever, that actually is an

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:45.340
awesome name, when you give adolescents a way to broadcast opinions anonymously, that can be

01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:49.460
dangerous, to which I say no shit, but it's nice to see, you know, companies acknowledging

01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:54.540
that, the nasty side of the teenage mind will manifest itself in that environment.

01:03:54.540 --> 01:04:02.300
Microsoft will do its best to seek out and ban anybody that is sharing really, really bad

01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:02.940
stuff.

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:10.380
I'm assuming talking about someone's charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent, but in a more

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:13.260
hateful way, right?

01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:14.980
I don't know how they do it, though.

01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:19.220
I'm assuming you've got to report people or it's got to be in messages or something

01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:23.020
intractable because Microsoft can't exactly monitor live games, can they?

01:04:23.940 --> 01:04:26.780
Well, I'm sure they have maybe.

01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:27.860
Yeah, they might.

01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:28.420
I don't know.

01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:32.340
They do have patents for that kind of stuff.

01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:37.220
And if you remember correctly, you know, not necessarily Microsoft, but EA with Kinect and

01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:37.900
stuff like that.

01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:40.940
They had a kind of similar feature in FIFA.

01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:46.300
Now, I read this story at Destructoid, Destructoid.com, and they bring up a really good

01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:47.860
point that I think is worth repeating.

01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:52.060
They take issue with the fact that adolescents are the only ones being targeted as being

01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:53.140
jerks online.

01:04:53.620 --> 01:04:58.300
And they say in this article, quote, Unfortunately, there are plenty of full grown adults

01:04:58.420 --> 01:05:03.100
who get their jollies by going into online games and being nasty or who attempt to bully

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:04.820
others because of perceived differences.

01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:06.580
I think that's a damn good point.

01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:11.180
Wasn't there a story around the Internet this week or maybe last week about the Reddit

01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:15.660
trolls and the people posting the really, really bad stuff to Reddit?

01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:20.660
And they traced it back to some thirty nine year old guy, you know, just one of your

01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:24.500
stereotypical basement going people with nothing better to do.

01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:26.900
And it bears to be repeated.

01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:30.180
Halo four is a fucking mature rated game.

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:33.100
So kids shouldn't be playing in the first place.

01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:37.820
But parents are fucking dumb or I should say parents have made the choice to have their

01:05:37.820 --> 01:05:39.660
kids play this mature rated game.

01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:44.700
At that same time, they should also be responsible for what they say or what they're

01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:45.660
exposed to.

01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:51.660
Bonds double six in our chat room says people still cry over what's being said online in

01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:56.540
a game. I'm not sure if I'm taking that, like if there's like a hint of sarcasm or

01:05:56.540 --> 01:06:00.540
something to that comment. But like, yes, and people should take issue to some of the

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:02.140
things that are said online in a game.

01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:08.580
Like, I'm sorry, I've been in Halo matches where I've heard people called faggot and far

01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:10.620
worse words I'm not going to say on this show.

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:13.380
And although they're all bad, let's be real.

01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:17.340
But it's just like, you know, yes, I take issue to that.

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:23.580
You know, as a gay guy who got called that a lot growing up in a very malicious way, who

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:28.980
you know, still has many emotional scars, for lack of a better word, with that shit.

01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:32.700
Yeah, I take issue with the fact that somebody is projecting that shit onto somebody

01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:39.460
else. And those people should have the privilege of playing an online game taken away

01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:42.860
from them. Yes, you pay for Xbox Live.

01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:48.300
But you also accept the terms of service that you won't generally be a dickbag when you

01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:52.220
play online. And if you fail to live up to the terms of service, then you should have it

01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:53.060
taken away.

01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:55.660
I don't like playing with cockbags online.

01:06:56.020 --> 01:06:59.260
There's been a lot of nice people I've met playing online, especially in playing Mass

01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:00.740
Effect, because a lot of that's co-ops.

01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:02.100
You don't have that same mentality.

01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:08.940
But, you know, and I think if you are going to call a girl who's brave enough to go on to

01:07:08.940 --> 01:07:14.980
the game and talk in the first place, if you're going to call her the big C-bomb, then,

01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:20.820
you know, that better be a term of endearment or some prearranged thing and not in a

01:07:20.820 --> 01:07:26.580
negative thing, because that's not OK to be calling women at random that word.

01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:32.540
You know what I mean? Or even, you know, bitch, whore, slut, all those other things.

01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:34.260
Right, Jamie?

01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:36.300
I'm kind of not bothered.

01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:42.060
So you don't care if you go online into a random match on Halo 4 and somebody drops the

01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:42.540
C-bomb?

01:07:43.300 --> 01:07:48.660
No, I mean, because really all I'll do, like, for example, it actually happened in a while,

01:07:48.660 --> 01:07:52.060
not too long ago, and all I did was just report and put them on ignore.

01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:52.780
What about my game?

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:59.700
Well, OK, then it didn't get like get under your skin, but you recognize that, hey, this

01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:02.980
person should probably have their freedom to play the game taken away from them.

01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:05.220
Right. This person is not mature enough to be in this game.

01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:08.260
Their ability to speak in said game should be revoked.

01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:13.540
I don't necessarily think they shouldn't be allowed to play the game because, you know,

01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:15.500
maybe they're good at it.

01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:18.660
I just think that their ability to speak should be revoked.

01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:23.620
I mean, because that's almost more frustrating as not being able to say something to

01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:30.980
somebody. And, you know, honestly, I like when you have a feature to just actively

01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:37.460
ignore something and then have it pop up, reverting to them, X person has you ignored.

01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:43.180
Then what good is saying anything going to do when the person that you're saying it at

01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:45.460
can't react, isn't going to react to it?

01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:47.860
The people are only doing that for attention.

01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:50.820
They're only doing that because they get something off on it.

01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:54.580
If you're not, if they're not bothered by it, what good is it going to do?

01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:59.700
I seem to remember Halo 3 had a really quick way to block people like that.

01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:04.180
Like, I remember reporting on some of the stories that, you know, you could just hit

01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:08.740
like the back button and it just shut them up automatically, which I thought was pretty

01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:08.980
neat.

01:09:09.980 --> 01:09:11.060
That's what I think it should be.

01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:15.700
But I think that they also need to get the feedback in return that this person isn't

01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:16.620
paying attention to you.

01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:22.180
I don't think that they should, because actually it's better if they don't know that

01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:24.060
because then they can't go, oh, you're not going to listen to me.

01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:25.460
I'm going to send an angry message at you.

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:27.740
I mean, no, it should completely block them.

01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:34.260
TheRobD, I think this is a very interesting point in chat, just want to throw this out

01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:39.860
there, live.vognetwork.com, TheRobD says, the only way we can improve the quality and

01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:44.500
diversity of gamers online is to hold them accountable for what they do.

01:09:45.020 --> 01:09:46.740
I agree with holding them accountable.

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:53.900
The one problem that I'm running into with this is the fact that there's so much gray

01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:55.700
area for offensive.

01:09:56.580 --> 01:10:03.100
I mean, having a certain list, yeah, that's one thing, you know, going too far, it

01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:04.500
definitely hold people accountable.

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:11.180
But I'm saying that it's kind of hard for me to try to think of how to phrase it.

01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:16.300
There are really thin skinned people out there who, you know, even just saying, oh,

01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:18.900
you suck is going to piss them off.

01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:23.300
You know, it's going to make them, you know, be in a world of boohoo.

01:10:23.340 --> 01:10:26.060
And maybe if they're that thin skinned, they shouldn't play.

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:28.620
I kind of I think I see what you're getting at.

01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:34.980
You're saying that, you know, maybe this opens the door to that total political

01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:38.500
correctness, hypersensitivity, these types of issues.

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:40.460
It's like, where do you draw the line?

01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:46.700
I mean, I think we can all agree you don't say certain words ever, you know, online.

01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:53.700
But, you know, somebody who might be ultra religious, grew up in Little House on the

01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:58.500
Prairie, has every right to play the same Xbox games you do, but would never say the

01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:01.300
word damn themselves and might take offense to that.

01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:07.260
Yeah, I know people who like a lady in one of my classes who is as Mormon as Mormon can

01:11:07.260 --> 01:11:09.220
be, doesn't drink coffee, none of that.

01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:11.140
And she's perfectly fine with other people.

01:11:11.220 --> 01:11:15.340
She doesn't, you know, she doesn't go la la la la la when someone says crap, you know.

01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:18.380
But at the same time, she won't do that thing herself.

01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:23.780
And she won't put herself in a position to where she's surrounded by it all the time.

01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:27.180
And now if she's in a situation that she can't get away from, she understands and

01:11:27.180 --> 01:11:31.220
accepts that that's a situation she can't get away with it, get away from it.

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:31.820
You know what I mean?

01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:38.660
And my big problem, and this is actually sort of goes back to the whole big political

01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:39.940
correctness thing.

01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:40.580
You know what I mean?

01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:48.700
Is that there are people who do take shit way too seriously.

01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:52.300
Now, there's just some people who, you know, maybe in a moment of frustration, they're

01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:54.500
like, well, well, shit, you suck.

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:56.220
You know, I'm just using something, you know.

01:11:56.340 --> 01:12:02.620
I've heard Dan drop a C-bomb at a game and then he will stop and go, oh, my God, I

01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:04.420
didn't mean to say that, you know.

01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:07.500
But here's the question.

01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:12.140
Did he say it in frustration to an NPC, the verbal equivalent of throwing the

01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:13.540
controller out the window?

01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:17.020
Or did he actually press the push to talk button and call somebody?

01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:18.620
He doesn't do that.

01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:19.460
Dan is a lot.

01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:23.420
Yeah, he'll go, oh, that was a fucking shit move.

01:12:23.420 --> 01:12:26.700
You know, when he's playing on, he plays Borderlands with his with his buddies.

01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:31.420
But I mean, the point with it is that I think there's a very.

01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:40.860
I'm trying to think of how to, there is a lot of room for.

01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:46.500
Oversensitizing things, you know what I mean?

01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:52.620
There would be opportunity to take action against somebody that you don't like for

01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:58.780
other reasons, like taking advantage of it to get somebody punished just because you

01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:00.780
want to punish for something that has nothing to do with the game.

01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:01.380
Right.

01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:03.780
If it was going to if it was going to be.

01:13:06.180 --> 01:13:07.740
I would rather have a strike rule.

01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:10.420
I'm going to go way back and go to DDR Freak.

01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:12.300
We had.

01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:14.420
You think the nine point system should be universal?

01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:16.020
Explain the system.

01:13:16.020 --> 01:13:16.660
Explain the system.

01:13:16.940 --> 01:13:22.300
We had a nine point rule, which basically for horrible offenses, then, yeah, they

01:13:22.300 --> 01:13:23.980
would get docked three points.

01:13:23.980 --> 01:13:26.740
And it was a three strike, three really bad offenses.

01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:30.100
And yeah, they got banned after nine points.

01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:36.060
But if there were very minor offenses, like, you know, maybe something that was

01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:40.060
mildly inflammatory or maybe unintentionally flaming, you know, then,

01:13:40.060 --> 01:13:43.300
yeah, they got like basically a one point warn for it.

01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:48.020
And I don't think that it was the warnings that could go like a person could bring

01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:51.260
something to my attention as a moderator and then make a judgment call.

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:56.540
If I got five things about one person from the same person, I'd only warn once

01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:59.340
because clearly there's something more going on.

01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:03.820
And if it seems like it's legit, I'll do the full three point warning for all five

01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:04.380
offenses.

01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:07.860
You know, that example, that was my mentality towards it.

01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:14.980
When, when you're going into, you know, if you say that you've got somebody who's

01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:20.940
really oversensitive playing their first round of Halo 4 forever and someone, you

01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:27.780
know, just lets out, you know, oh, that was fucking cheap or, you know, makes one

01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:30.940
statement, oh, you don't know how to play, you know, I'm going mild with it.

01:14:31.260 --> 01:14:35.740
And that person gets really butthurt and says, oh, you said something offensive to

01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:40.620
me, you know, even in the case of constructive criticism, because I've seen

01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:44.700
people in WoW when you try to give them feedback on how they're playing and they

01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:46.020
go completely off on you.

01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:48.460
Don't tell me how to fucking play my character, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:14:48.740 --> 01:14:51.900
When really the person was just giving really good constructive feedback.

01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:56.260
You know, maybe you're having an off day to say, I'm having off night, but there's

01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:59.220
people who take constructive criticism the wrong way too.

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:05.340
It's, it's really, you know, what I'm meaning about a really gray area is that

01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:09.420
when you've got so many variables of personality involved with it, you're

01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:13.020
running into a problem and you are running into people who are just going to

01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:16.380
be, you know, hypersensitive.

01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:20.380
There's people like that in the world, people who do not, who will take offense

01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:24.300
to any little thing and go on a fucking rampage trying to prove that they're

01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:29.020
right. If, if you know what I mean, you know, that's why we have so many stupid,

01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:32.340
you know, lawsuits go into effect, you know, violent video game laws.

01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:37.060
All this is we have a quite a bit of hypersensitivity going on.

01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:45.500
I, I'm really trying to get how, now, I mean, if you've got someone who, yeah,

01:15:45.820 --> 01:15:49.100
they've dropped the C-bomb, you know, three different times in one game and

01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:52.100
everyone's put out the warning on them, ban them.

01:15:52.900 --> 01:15:56.180
If it's with their buddies and their buddies are doing it to warn each of their

01:15:56.180 --> 01:15:59.140
buddies, they get booted from the game for an hour, they get a certain number of

01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:00.740
warrants, they're gone forever.

01:16:02.460 --> 01:16:03.700
Give them a three strikes.

01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:07.500
The DDR freak system should be applied everywhere.

01:16:08.020 --> 01:16:09.140
I think it was wise.

01:16:09.140 --> 01:16:12.300
The one thing, the one part you missed, if you were, if you were good, you would

01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:13.660
start to lose points every month.

01:16:13.900 --> 01:16:19.700
Right. Yeah. And, but that honestly, I actually did see that starting to really

01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:23.380
benefit. And I never, ever got a point ever.

01:16:23.820 --> 01:16:28.500
I can fix that now. No, not when they're dead, dead and gone.

01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:32.740
Not when they're dead. But, but my, my point is that, you know, if you've got

01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:37.700
someone who's having a really shitty day and they go off on someone, yeah, they

01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:39.980
should be held accountable for going off on somebody.

01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:44.940
But if they realize, oh, I see this is going to be something that's gonna, you

01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:50.860
know, catch up with me later, then definitely give them an opportunity to

01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:52.180
amend their behavior.

01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:56.780
If they don't amend their behavior, knock them out.

01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:59.460
Don't even give, you know, a number of how many warnings you have.

01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:00.660
Don't advertise that shit.

01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:03.140
Don't advertise that your points will drop off.

01:17:03.740 --> 01:17:08.100
Just say you get a certain amount of warning again, you're dropped.

01:17:08.820 --> 01:17:10.100
You know, it is up to us.

01:17:10.140 --> 01:17:11.220
We can give you one strike.

01:17:11.220 --> 01:17:12.500
We can give you three strikes.

01:17:12.860 --> 01:17:14.300
It depends on what we see.

01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:17.580
All right, well, gosh, we get to keep talking about this where we've had a lot

01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:18.540
of good discussions tonight.

01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:19.260
What's up with this?

01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:23.220
This is supposed to be a slow news week, live.vognetwork.com.

01:17:23.260 --> 01:17:27.500
We could, again, keep this topic going forever, but, uh, we do want to end, you

01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:30.220
know, some point tonight instead of tomorrow morning.

01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:32.060
So we're going to keep moving on in the interest of time.

01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:33.900
So why don't we, they were right about DancerRx.

01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:34.420
Why?

01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:34.820
Yeah.

01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:36.620
Why don't we go to that next story, Darcyra?

01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:38.060
Okay.

01:17:38.060 --> 01:17:42.580
Well, if God, if my voice comes back, um, there, I'm sure I've told the story

01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:46.820
before about my copy of Descent that I used to have that came on 14 disks.

01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:49.060
And yes, I sat and installed.

01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:50.500
That was the way to play.

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:57.660
I have a good friend named Avery who had a chair that he put two controllers on

01:17:57.980 --> 01:17:59.900
and a five, a 10 key pad.

01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:02.020
Did he invent mailing labels that go in the printer?

01:18:02.020 --> 01:18:02.540
Shut up.

01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:05.540
And, um, hearts, hearts, hearts.

01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:10.260
Um, and he had his, bitch, please.

01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:15.980
Now, and, uh, he had, uh, his, uh, Descent chair.

01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:17.060
That was the big thing.

01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:21.460
Well, the reason why I'm bringing up all this Descent nostalgia is because there's

01:18:21.460 --> 01:18:28.340
a modder going by the name of Max, who is recreating Descent using Unreal Engine 3

01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:29.820
using the Unreal development kit.

01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:35.060
And, um, the big thing about this is basically he's going sort of the path of

01:18:35.060 --> 01:18:41.780
Black Mesa, um, where it's called Descent to UDK, where it's not exactly a remake,

01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:46.100
but it's going to bring in the original story with some embellishments.

01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:51.460
He's basically trying to diversify the original gameplay and, um, emphasize the,

01:18:51.780 --> 01:18:57.300
the scary bits and new weapons, new weapons was good, but man, Descent was the

01:18:57.300 --> 01:19:04.660
first game I played that gave me motion sickness and I sucked at it, but I loved

01:19:04.660 --> 01:19:06.020
it for people our age.

01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:08.900
They all remember the first time playing a game like Descent.

01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:12.340
It was like, it's doom and 360 degrees.

01:19:12.340 --> 01:19:13.700
No, but it's so cool.

01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:15.060
It was even more than that.

01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:18.980
Instead of having your, you know, little space shooters where you're on rails or,

01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:22.820
you know, going through different areas, you had full freedom of movement.

01:19:22.820 --> 01:19:23.780
It was amazing.

01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:28.980
Um, I mean, and yeah, there were more games, you know, there was when it went

01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:33.460
into Descent three, but going back to the original and bringing in those factors

01:19:33.460 --> 01:19:36.660
that made the original great is I think a good idea.

01:19:36.660 --> 01:19:43.700
There's, uh, Eurogamer actually has a, uh, um, trailer for it up on their website.

01:19:43.700 --> 01:19:44.500
It looked pretty good.

01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:47.780
I liked the music in Descent too.

01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:51.700
All right, let's move on and travel around the world and check out some release

01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:54.900
dates and things that are coming through more official channels this week.

01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:57.060
Yeah, I think there's something coming out this week.

01:19:57.060 --> 01:19:58.420
I'm sure there's a game.

01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:00.340
Um, we'll, we'll get to it though.

01:20:00.340 --> 01:20:02.420
Uh, see what we've got this week.

01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:04.660
Uh, what's the, what's the big game that's coming out?

01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:10.820
Maybe it's a Freaky Forms Deluxe Creations Alive on 3DS.

01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:11.460
Is that it?

01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:12.340
No, maybe.

01:20:13.220 --> 01:20:16.100
Uh, maybe it's a game for a system that's not out for a couple of weeks.

01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:19.300
Mass Effect 3, the special edition for the Wii U.

01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:22.420
Yeah, probably want to wait on that one.

01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:23.460
That's out this week.

01:20:24.260 --> 01:20:25.140
How does that work?

01:20:26.980 --> 01:20:27.860
I don't know.

01:20:27.860 --> 01:20:29.860
I think, I think the dates need adjusting.

01:20:29.860 --> 01:20:32.020
I think, I think, you know, they're, what?

01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:36.340
We've got in hand like Scribblenauts already.

01:20:36.340 --> 01:20:38.900
Um, not that we can do anything with it.

01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:39.220
All right.

01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:46.340
Uh, maybe it's Nickelodeon Bubble Guppies on the DS or Nickelodeon Team Umi Zumi and

01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:51.860
Dora's Fantastic Flight, both rated EC for those hardcore gamers out there in the DS.

01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:56.660
Uh, or maybe Nickelodeon Dance 2 on the Wii and Xbox 360.

01:20:57.620 --> 01:20:58.660
No, no.

01:20:59.540 --> 01:21:04.500
NASCAR, the game Inside Line on PS3, Xbox 360, and Wii.

01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:05.140
Maybe?

01:21:05.140 --> 01:21:05.380
No.

01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:09.460
Mass Effect Trilogy on PC and Xbox 360.

01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:12.340
That is absolutely the game, as everybody.

01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:13.380
Totally.

01:21:14.420 --> 01:21:18.100
Midway Arcade Origins on PS3 and Xbox 360 this week.

01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:22.500
Also, I bought, I bought that last generation.

01:21:23.140 --> 01:21:28.900
Also, uh, History Legends of War Patton on Xbox 360 and PS3.

01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:31.620
Oh, I think that's coming out next year, though.

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:34.660
Uh, Pop Tropica Adventures on the DS.

01:21:35.380 --> 01:21:41.700
Dragon Ball Z Budokai HD Collection on PS3 and Xbox 360.

01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:43.700
Ragnarok Tactics on PSP.

01:21:45.380 --> 01:21:48.340
Uh, on PSP?

01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:49.220
PSP.

01:21:50.100 --> 01:21:52.980
Not Vita, PSP.

01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:55.780
They just had a Ragnarok game on Vita already.

01:21:55.780 --> 01:21:56.900
It came out last week.

01:21:57.540 --> 01:22:02.500
Um, Saints Row the Third, the full package on PS3 and Xbox 360.

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:06.180
Let's be honest, so this really has the same content that was already on disc for the last game.

01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:08.420
Ba dum bum.

01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:12.500
Well, except for the, except for the three expansions, but all the other DLC was on disc.

01:22:13.060 --> 01:22:17.300
Um, Big Time Rush Dance Party on the Wii.

01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:21.700
Rayman Origins on the 3DS.

01:22:22.500 --> 01:22:24.980
Pro Evolution Soccer 2013 on the Wii.

01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:28.740
Little Big Planet Karting on PS3.

01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:33.540
Oh, and that's right, there is a game called Halo 4 that's out on the 360 this week as well.

01:22:34.340 --> 01:22:37.380
And not to be, uh, outdone, Nintendo does have a game coming out.

01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:40.180
Paper Mario Sticker Star on the 3DS one week from today.

01:22:41.220 --> 01:22:43.940
Ray Genator just made one of my favorite jokes about NASCAR.

01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:46.260
NASCAR has left turned the game.

01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:49.940
Oh boy.

01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:51.140
You really like to go left.

01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:52.100
You really like Tide.

01:22:55.060 --> 01:22:58.420
You gonna go to one of those midnight releases and pick up, uh, Little Big Planet Karting?

01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:01.860
I'm not even sure if I'm gonna pick up Little Big Planet Karting.

01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:04.260
I wanna play it, but I haven't played Little Big Planet 2.

01:23:05.860 --> 01:23:06.900
So, probably not.

01:23:07.700 --> 01:23:09.620
Although, I do like Karting games.

01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:12.180
I'd be a little bit more, you know, motivated to play that, but.

01:23:12.180 --> 01:23:16.340
All I'm gonna say, I know you haven't seen Wreck-It Ralph yet, I'm not gonna spoil it for you,

01:23:16.340 --> 01:23:18.900
but they need to make Sugar Rush a real game.

01:23:18.980 --> 01:23:20.340
Yes, they do.

01:23:20.340 --> 01:23:23.140
But, because that was fucking outstanding.

01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:25.220
I would play the hell out of Sugar Rush.

01:23:25.220 --> 01:23:30.580
Wreck-It Ralph is in the new Sonic and Sega All-Stars racing game, Transformed.

01:23:30.580 --> 01:23:32.660
Well, I hope there's a track or something.

01:23:32.660 --> 01:23:33.460
There'd be Vanellope.

01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:34.820
Yeah, Vanellope von Schweetz.

01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:40.660
Which, by the way, there's actually a commercial for Sugar Rush.

01:23:40.660 --> 01:23:41.060
Oh yeah?

01:23:41.060 --> 01:23:43.220
That was done as a sort of trailer for Wreck-It Ralph.

01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:43.860
Nice.

01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:48.340
Um, talking about the arcade, they're getting it in four quarters on your birthday.

01:23:48.820 --> 01:23:52.340
I so want to say a quote from the ending, and I can't say it because it's a spoiler,

01:23:52.340 --> 01:23:54.740
but it's one of the, like, you gotta know what I'm talking about.

01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:56.980
I was laughing so hard.

01:23:56.980 --> 01:23:58.580
It was the funniest thing in the movie.

01:23:58.580 --> 01:23:59.620
Like, I'll tell you later.

01:24:00.340 --> 01:24:01.140
Off air.

01:24:01.140 --> 01:24:02.420
I don't want to spoil it.

01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:05.540
Alright, let's spoil some Japanese release dates.

01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:08.580
Did you know that Japan is also getting Halo 4 this week,

01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:13.460
and they're getting some new Xbox 360s to come along with it for all those Japanese Halo fans?

01:24:13.460 --> 01:24:14.180
There you go.

01:24:14.180 --> 01:24:16.340
Both of you guys can get that this week.

01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:19.300
Also coming out this week on the Xbox 360,

01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:20.980
Tropico 4 Gold Edition.

01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:23.220
I think that's just a price reduction of an existing game.

01:24:23.220 --> 01:24:25.460
It's a re-release they're doing.

01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:27.780
It's the game with the expansion.

01:24:27.780 --> 01:24:28.660
Alright.

01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:32.260
On the PlayStation 3, Silent Hill Downpour, finally,

01:24:33.140 --> 01:24:35.620
on the PlayStation 3 in Japan this week.

01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:38.500
Shin Sangoku Musou Six Empires.

01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:42.180
Hokuto Musou International getting a price reduction from Koei,

01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:47.140
as well as a price reduction for Champion Jockey, G1 Jockey, and Gallop Racer,

01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:50.020
for those of you that like your horsey racing games in Japan.

01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:53.220
And the really embarrassing move integration.

01:24:53.220 --> 01:24:54.900
Oh, is that the other big thing?

01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:57.700
You're the one that looks like you're playing, was it?

01:24:58.420 --> 01:24:59.220
Final Furlong.

01:24:59.220 --> 01:25:00.420
Final Furlong, yeah.

01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:01.700
That game was amazing.

01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:02.820
Horse Humping the game.

01:25:02.820 --> 01:25:04.020
Uh, let's see.

01:25:04.020 --> 01:25:06.980
Lastly, when do we get Wii U stuff in Japan?

01:25:06.980 --> 01:25:07.380
Oh, that's right.

01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:08.740
They don't get it until December, huh?

01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:11.780
I don't start reading those release dates until December.

01:25:13.060 --> 01:25:14.500
How about the Nintendo 3DS?

01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:19.620
Another 3DS LL, which is basically their XL pack.

01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:23.700
It's a Dobutsu no Mori pack, limited edition,

01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:29.860
because Tobidase Dobutsu no Mori comes out this week on the Nintendo 3DS.

01:25:29.860 --> 01:25:31.860
And what is Dobutsu no Mori?

01:25:31.860 --> 01:25:32.660
Animal Forest.

01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:33.300
That's right.

01:25:33.300 --> 01:25:34.820
AKA Animal Crossing.

01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:35.220
That's right.

01:25:35.220 --> 01:25:37.620
Animal Crossing is the big release on the 3DS.

01:25:37.620 --> 01:25:39.300
Technically, that would be Animal's Forest.

01:25:40.020 --> 01:25:43.860
Now, um, if Animal Crossing isn't your thing, maybe you're more into Jewel Pet.

01:25:45.860 --> 01:25:51.860
Maho de Osare ni Dance Deco comes out this week as well on the 3DS.

01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:56.820
That's fantastic that the, you know, 3DS isn't region-free like the DS was, because,

01:25:56.820 --> 01:26:00.820
you know, people then can't import games that they like to play.

01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:04.420
It would be very hard to play Animal Crossing anyway, because it's all in Japan, Japanese.

01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:09.060
I've freaking tried on my Dobutsu no Mori for GameCube.

01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:14.020
And even being, I read so slowly, it takes an hour to do anything.

01:26:14.020 --> 01:26:15.700
But I think what's really cool is that,

01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:18.500
I don't know if you guys know this, but the, well, I know I'm sure you do, Jamie,

01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:21.380
but when the little characters read when they're talking,

01:26:21.380 --> 01:26:25.860
in the Japanese version of the game, they were saying the little Japanese syllables really quick.

01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:27.700
So it sounded like they were actually talking.

01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:30.580
But in the English version, you can't really do that same thing.

01:26:30.580 --> 01:26:33.140
So they would say the letters of the alphabet real fast.

01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:33.640
Yeah.

01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:34.700
So...

01:26:34.700 --> 01:26:37.400
And see, that's why I wanted the Japanese one to play.

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:37.900
Yeah.

01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:40.440
Because I thought it would help me with my listening comprehension, no.

01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:43.320
No, it went way too fast.

01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:44.600
Made it worse.

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:45.960
Okay, how about the UK, DarkSakura?

01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:48.600
We have a few selections for the UK.

01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:50.360
On November 6th is Halo 4.

01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:54.920
On the 7th is Curiosity for iPhone, PC, Android, and iPad.

01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:59.800
I hope the cube contains eternal joy.

01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:03.640
Karateka for Xbox 360.

01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:06.040
When is the weekend?

01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:07.400
Are you gonna get the cube?

01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:08.520
Do you want to know what's in the cube?

01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:10.200
Curiosity, what's in the fucking cube?

01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:11.080
What's in the box?

01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:12.920
What's in the fucking box?

01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:13.720
Tell me what's in the box.

01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:15.800
I still have to update my iOS version,

01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:20.440
but I would like to pirate it just for the principle of the thing.

01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:23.800
On November 8th, we have Angry Birds Star Wars.

01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:29.240
On the 9th, a little big cart, little big planet carting.

01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:33.000
And Mass Effect trilogy, which I'm gonna make my husband get me.

01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:35.640
And that's it.

01:27:35.640 --> 01:27:40.920
You do, I hope you did realize that little big planet carting is not coming on the Vita at launch.

01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:46.120
But if I buy it on the PS3, I'll still get my free Vita, right?

01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:47.480
Isn't that part of the deal?

01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:49.000
I haven't seen the sticker on the box.

01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:51.800
I know it's on the box for the PlayStation All-Stars stuff,

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:55.080
but at the same time, like, I don't really want that game.

01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:56.520
That's not even gonna sell that for me.

01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:00.440
By the way, you know what I totally love about playing Mass Effect on the PC?

01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:01.240
What?

01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:04.520
Is hacking the coalesced I&I file to get other outfits.

01:28:04.520 --> 01:28:06.680
And you wonder why you can't get online in part three.

01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:09.400
No, I reinstalled the fucker.

01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:11.480
And it wasn't working.

01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:13.240
So bite my booty.

01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:13.880
Reported.

01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:19.480
All right, just a couple more news stories for you guys.

01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:23.000
And then the classic game of the week, back when games worked.

01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:24.380
Loki.

01:28:25.340 --> 01:28:28.220
So yes, there's a patent firm.

01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:31.020
And I don't even know why these things exist, but whatever.

01:28:31.660 --> 01:28:37.500
A Texas company has filed a lawsuit against Wizards of the Coast.

01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:40.540
Or not against Wizards of the Coast, I guess.

01:28:40.540 --> 01:28:43.340
Hasbro, who has the Magic of the Gathering online game.

01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:45.900
I didn't even realize Hasbro does online games,

01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:47.820
but okay, I guess I got in the video game.

01:28:47.820 --> 01:28:50.460
So anyways, so Magic of the Gathering online.

01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:54.140
You know, it's been out there for a while now.

01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:55.260
Ten years.

01:28:55.260 --> 01:29:00.220
And I guess this Wildcat intellectual property holdings of Dallas.

01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:04.300
They're filing a lawsuit against them to get it taken offline.

01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:07.500
I guess they hold the patent for Unit Commander.

01:29:08.060 --> 01:29:11.820
Which calls, I guess, the ultimate mercenary trading card game.

01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:14.620
And they're saying that it infringes on that.

01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:22.140
Which something tells me that they probably had the Magic of the Gathering out there

01:29:22.140 --> 01:29:26.300
for a lot longer than they've had the patent for Unit Commander.

01:29:27.660 --> 01:29:32.300
Which, I might add, is about as generic as their patent for said game.

01:29:34.460 --> 01:29:35.100
I don't know.

01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:35.600
We'll see.

01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:38.940
We'll see if they even...

01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:40.860
I don't think anything's really gonna happen to it.

01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:42.220
I mean, patent troll.

01:29:43.020 --> 01:29:43.820
We can do.

01:29:43.820 --> 01:29:47.500
It really does astound me that Magic of the Gathering is still going after all this time.

01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:48.700
Pretty strong, you know?

01:29:48.700 --> 01:29:51.660
There was just a tournament here locally over the weekend, did you know that?

01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:53.020
I wouldn't doubt it.

01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:55.500
They have tournaments playing this like mad.

01:29:55.500 --> 01:29:56.940
And I still suck at it.

01:29:58.940 --> 01:30:01.500
Well, it's because they've had all this practice and...

01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:01.980
It's true.

01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:03.340
They've been playing for 15 years.

01:30:04.300 --> 01:30:05.020
I took a break.

01:30:05.660 --> 01:30:08.140
All right, this is pretty awesome.

01:30:08.140 --> 01:30:10.700
A new remake that's been announced for the 3DS.

01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:12.060
Dark Soccer, you might be into this too.

01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:16.300
Dragon Quest 7 is being remade for the 3DS.

01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:19.660
It's already got a date of February 7th in Japan.

01:30:19.740 --> 01:30:21.820
It's gonna have a new soundtrack and so forth.

01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:24.780
So yeah, that's awesome.

01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:27.420
Yeah, Jump Magazine made the confirmation.

01:30:27.420 --> 01:30:30.060
February 7th, 6,090 yen.

01:30:30.860 --> 01:30:34.300
There will be street pass and Wi-Fi capabilities added to the game.

01:30:34.300 --> 01:30:35.420
I don't know what that's gonna entail.

01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:36.940
That's pretty fucking rad.

01:30:36.940 --> 01:30:41.500
The soundtrack will be performed by the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra.

01:30:42.380 --> 01:30:43.180
That's rad.

01:30:44.220 --> 01:30:44.780
Very nice.

01:30:44.780 --> 01:30:46.460
I really hope that comes out over here.

01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:46.960
We'll see.

01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:52.240
Dragon Quest 7, if you weren't aware, was originally released on the PlayStation 1.

01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:53.680
That was about 12 years ago.

01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:56.320
It was released in the USA, Dragon Warrior 7.

01:30:56.320 --> 01:30:56.820
Yes, it was.

01:30:57.920 --> 01:31:01.120
Didn't they finally go back to calling it Dragon Quest in the US with 8, though?

01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:01.360
Yeah.

01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:02.080
I thought they did.

01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:02.960
Oh, and the play...

01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:05.440
Man, that's a PS2 game needed to go back and really beat.

01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:07.200
Dragon Quest 8 was so good.

01:31:07.200 --> 01:31:09.520
The demo for that was like a big thing.

01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:15.040
So no word yet if that is coming here, but one can hope.

01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:20.080
I bet it'll be one of those things we don't get to next holiday, though.

01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:21.200
But that's pretty awesome.

01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:23.120
Dragon Quest 7.

01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:27.440
Well, what a good lead-in to the Classic Game of the Week.

01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:30.240
I don't know if this week's game is 12 years old or older,

01:31:31.440 --> 01:31:35.360
but every week we like to let DarkSakura take a step into the Classic Gaming Vault

01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:37.040
and find a game that she thinks,

01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:37.540
hey,

01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:39.140
Bratz,

01:31:40.080 --> 01:31:41.120
play this game,

01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:42.800
and then report me for calling you a brat.

01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:45.040
It's the Classic Game of the Week.

01:31:45.040 --> 01:31:46.720
DarkSakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?

01:31:46.720 --> 01:31:47.360
Bank your ass.

01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:49.840
Uh, it's Giga-Wink 2.

01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:54.000
And I'm actually specifically referring to the Dreamcast version,

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:56.720
because today has been my day of Dreamcast love.

01:31:57.520 --> 01:31:59.440
It's always a day of Dreamcast love for you.

01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:01.280
This was a fun shooter,

01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:03.120
and the cool thing about it is that,

01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:05.040
even in the arcade version,

01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:09.680
it was actually made for a horizontal monitor instead of being turned vertically.

01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:11.920
You know another game that did that?

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:13.440
Radiant Silver Gun.

01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:14.820
How's that?

01:32:15.620 --> 01:32:19.620
But anyway, the game was originally developed by Takumi,

01:32:19.620 --> 01:32:23.140
and it came out on the NAOMI arcade system,

01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:25.380
and then in 2001 it came out on the Dreamcast.

01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:30.340
It basically has like uber huge scores.

01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:32.980
It seriously is like the ego-pumping score system.

01:32:32.980 --> 01:32:34.820
You can actually score in the quintillions.

01:32:34.820 --> 01:32:35.460
Did you know that?

01:32:37.060 --> 01:32:41.460
On top of that, the good thing about it being a horizontal monitor

01:32:41.460 --> 01:32:44.660
is that taking it from arcade to the home version,

01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:48.980
meant that you pretty much still got the arcade treatment.

01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:52.100
You didn't have to worry about rotating your TV or anything else,

01:32:52.100 --> 01:32:53.860
you know, on edge or any of that,

01:32:54.420 --> 01:32:57.380
which we've actually done some games before.

01:32:57.380 --> 01:32:59.780
In the Dreamcast version, it added a score attack mode,

01:32:59.780 --> 01:33:02.100
a four player mode, gallery mode, online ranking,

01:33:02.740 --> 01:33:09.140
and which actually ended on December 10th, 2003.

01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:14.500
So you had like a ton of different fighters.

01:33:15.460 --> 01:33:17.220
A good half of them actually were unlocked.

01:33:17.220 --> 01:33:22.980
You could have Kingfisher, Sparrow, Ravenstork, and Albatross,

01:33:22.980 --> 01:33:25.780
and then you could have the Raijin,

01:33:28.340 --> 01:33:31.540
Porchka, Stranger, Carmine, and Wilderstand,

01:33:32.260 --> 01:33:35.060
which were from the first Giggling.

01:33:36.260 --> 01:33:38.980
The soundtrack was super awesome,

01:33:38.980 --> 01:33:41.620
and I even remembered when you could get the soundtrack,

01:33:41.620 --> 01:33:43.300
it came with the soundtrack from Mars Matrix,

01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:44.980
which is another game I probably should do,

01:33:46.100 --> 01:33:48.180
but the music is all orchestral.

01:33:48.180 --> 01:33:49.220
It should turn up a little bit.

01:33:54.580 --> 01:33:56.180
They had a really crazy soundtrack.

01:33:56.180 --> 01:33:59.620
I mean, really, I mean, in the end, it's a shooter, yeah,

01:34:00.500 --> 01:34:03.620
but it's definitely one that people should check out,

01:34:03.620 --> 01:34:07.380
especially since the Dreamcast is still kind of around and kicking.

01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:08.980
And it's pretty.

01:34:09.620 --> 01:34:11.380
And the other thing about that too,

01:34:11.380 --> 01:34:14.820
is it is basically around the gameplay itself,

01:34:14.820 --> 01:34:18.500
is around the absorption and reflection type mechanics.

01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:22.580
It's huge boss fights, tons of enemies.

01:34:23.220 --> 01:34:25.540
It's, I wouldn't quite say it's a bullet hell

01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:27.060
as much as it is an enemy hell,

01:34:28.020 --> 01:34:31.060
but I love the level scrolling in the design.

01:34:31.060 --> 01:34:33.620
It's like it adds another layer of depth,

01:34:33.620 --> 01:34:37.780
even if it is a top-down type shooter.

01:34:38.420 --> 01:34:40.740
So definitely worth playing.

01:34:41.700 --> 01:34:42.340
All righty.

01:34:42.340 --> 01:34:44.420
Some Dreamcast love from dark soccer this week

01:34:44.420 --> 01:34:45.540
in the classic game of the week.

01:34:45.540 --> 01:34:48.900
It is Giga Wing 2, or the Dreamcast.

01:34:50.420 --> 01:34:51.220
Very nice pick.

01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:53.460
Let's see.

01:34:53.460 --> 01:34:55.220
Yyr in the chat room says,

01:34:55.220 --> 01:34:57.380
Giga Wing 2 is also the only shmup I know of

01:34:57.380 --> 01:34:59.220
that supports four simultaneous players.

01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:00.340
Exactly.

01:35:01.300 --> 01:35:01.780
All right.

01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:04.740
Well, that is going to do it for part A of our show,

01:35:04.740 --> 01:35:05.460
but don't go anywhere.

01:35:05.460 --> 01:35:07.940
There is plenty more Orange Launch Radio to come tonight,

01:35:07.940 --> 01:35:09.860
including the Fugu question of the week.

01:35:09.860 --> 01:35:12.420
Some details on the Wii U's browser.

01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:13.620
It's going to be very interesting,

01:35:13.620 --> 01:35:15.620
as well as some other Nintendo details.

01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:18.820
And Mega Man Wily Wars.

01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:20.340
If you don't know about this game,

01:35:20.340 --> 01:35:21.620
may have fallen off your radar.

01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:22.340
It's not a new game.

01:35:22.340 --> 01:35:23.460
It's a game for many, many years ago.

01:35:23.460 --> 01:35:24.740
It was for the Genesis.

01:35:24.740 --> 01:35:28.420
It never came out in the US until now.

01:35:28.420 --> 01:35:30.500
So we'll be talking about that after the break.

01:35:36.660 --> 01:35:39.780
Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:41.300
Live at the Voice of Geeks Network,

01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:45.700
vaughnetwork.com with the 480th episode of our show.

01:35:47.060 --> 01:35:49.220
Possibly a different time for some of you tonight,

01:35:49.220 --> 01:35:51.300
because there was that whole daylight savings

01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:52.820
that happened over the weekend.

01:35:52.820 --> 01:35:55.460
And you know what they say, spring forward, fall back.

01:35:55.460 --> 01:35:57.860
So everybody got an extra hour sleep last night.

01:35:57.860 --> 01:35:58.420
Woo hoo.

01:35:58.420 --> 01:35:59.220
I needed it.

01:35:59.220 --> 01:36:02.020
Or if you were me, you got home at four in the morning

01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:03.300
instead of five in the morning.

01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:05.780
That was my lucky thing,

01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:08.020
but that's what I get for going to the Bay Area

01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:10.260
and staying out late and then driving home the same night.

01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:10.980
Why?

01:36:10.980 --> 01:36:14.740
Because I had Starbucks and I wasn't feeling tired.

01:36:15.460 --> 01:36:18.260
Hooray, by the way, for Peppermint Mocha's

01:36:18.260 --> 01:36:19.380
being back at Starbucks.

01:36:19.380 --> 01:36:21.380
I guess technically you can get those any time of the year.

01:36:21.380 --> 01:36:22.740
You can also get them sugar free.

01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:24.740
But yeah, they have the skinny ones now, which is great.

01:36:24.740 --> 01:36:26.180
But you know what they don't have yet

01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:27.940
is the gingerbread lattes.

01:36:27.940 --> 01:36:29.940
And those are amazing.

01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:31.860
Anyway, it's not a coffee cast.

01:36:31.860 --> 01:36:32.980
It's a video game cast.

01:36:32.980 --> 01:36:35.620
It's just coffee is sometimes how we get through the day.

01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:38.020
We will get back to video games.

01:36:38.020 --> 01:36:40.020
Rob, coffee is how I get through my life.

01:36:40.900 --> 01:36:43.380
I do want to mention the elections are this week.

01:36:43.380 --> 01:36:44.100
You might have heard.

01:36:44.100 --> 01:36:47.460
So of course, if you live in the US or, you know,

01:36:47.460 --> 01:36:49.940
a country that lets you vote, you probably should vote.

01:36:50.660 --> 01:36:52.580
It is your right after all.

01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:55.060
And remember, you do not get to bitch about the results

01:36:55.060 --> 01:36:56.580
if you do not vote.

01:36:56.580 --> 01:36:59.700
And I, for one, can't wait for those freaking election calls

01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:02.100
to stop calling me on my phone every 10 minutes.

01:37:02.100 --> 01:37:04.900
I did, however, get to call Dan Lundgren.

01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:07.300
A dick where he would hear it.

01:37:08.340 --> 01:37:08.980
Good times.

01:37:08.980 --> 01:37:10.420
Of course, it was an accident.

01:37:10.420 --> 01:37:12.100
It just cracked me up that you and I

01:37:12.100 --> 01:37:14.660
got the exact same phone call at the exact same time

01:37:14.660 --> 01:37:15.860
while we were sitting here in the studio.

01:37:15.860 --> 01:37:16.660
It's like, really?

01:37:16.660 --> 01:37:17.160
Really?

01:37:17.700 --> 01:37:20.740
Anyhow, let's get it back into video games

01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:22.260
and some rapid fire news.

01:37:22.260 --> 01:37:22.760
Loki.

01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:23.800
All right.

01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:26.100
So first thing, we're going to talk a little bit

01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:29.540
about a new addition for a smart glass member.

01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:32.020
We knew that Forza Horizon was going to use smart glass,

01:37:32.020 --> 01:37:33.220
but it kind of wasn't.

01:37:33.220 --> 01:37:34.900
So now it is.

01:37:34.980 --> 01:37:37.140
And so they've got some really cool stuff with that,

01:37:37.140 --> 01:37:40.180
including an in-game map that you can use,

01:37:41.700 --> 01:37:42.740
which is kind of cool.

01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:45.620
And I guess it allows you to do all the same stuff

01:37:45.620 --> 01:37:47.060
that you can do by pausing the game,

01:37:47.060 --> 01:37:48.660
but now without pausing the game.

01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:51.380
And you can set destination GPSes and all that stuff.

01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:54.340
Might be kind of cool.

01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:55.700
I'd have to check that out, I guess.

01:37:56.260 --> 01:37:58.340
Because Forza looks like it might be fun.

01:37:58.340 --> 01:37:59.940
Have to ask Bobby if he's tried it yet.

01:38:00.740 --> 01:38:02.660
He did a review at vognetwork.com.

01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:03.860
He would tell you to go read.

01:38:03.860 --> 01:38:04.580
Well, I understand that.

01:38:04.580 --> 01:38:05.940
But I meant about the smart glass thing.

01:38:05.940 --> 01:38:06.900
Oh, the smart glass.

01:38:06.900 --> 01:38:08.180
Oh, I don't know about that.

01:38:08.180 --> 01:38:08.680
Yeah.

01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:11.620
He's busy with the football stuff.

01:38:11.620 --> 01:38:14.340
So I played the demo for Forza.

01:38:14.340 --> 01:38:15.460
I didn't do the smart glass thing,

01:38:15.460 --> 01:38:16.660
because I don't think that's in the demo.

01:38:16.660 --> 01:38:18.500
But I like the demo.

01:38:18.500 --> 01:38:20.580
I might pick up the game.

01:38:20.580 --> 01:38:20.980
I don't know.

01:38:20.980 --> 01:38:23.300
It's kind of like there's just so much right now that.

01:38:23.300 --> 01:38:24.740
I have that racing wheel, man.

01:38:24.740 --> 01:38:27.540
It's been collecting dust that I kind of need to use that.

01:38:27.540 --> 01:38:30.100
So I may have to pick it up to try that.

01:38:31.460 --> 01:38:31.960
Excellent.

01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:35.880
Um, also something that's kind of cool, that shoot mania storm.

01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:37.800
I was kind of a fan of track mania.

01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:41.080
And so now they're getting into the other type of games.

01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:45.800
Shoot mania being their kind of first person shooter arena battle game.

01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:50.600
Although, I mean, one of the things about the whole mania series is that you can customize

01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:53.560
everything, including the game types and all that and share those.

01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:59.960
So it is going to be, I guess, coming soon in a beta form.

01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:03.080
And that'll be out in December.

01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:09.400
And then the game is expected to arrive on January 23rd, which is going to be kind of cool.

01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:13.160
And I guess the beta is going to also have like a welcome build.

01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:15.560
They're going to have a couple new game modes and stuff.

01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:19.320
Like one they mentioned is laser jump and wall jump and grappling hook.

01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:22.600
I can't help but think about looking at this stuff.

01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:25.480
It'd be kind of cool like a 3D laser tag game.

01:39:25.480 --> 01:39:26.840
That might be pretty awesome, but.

01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:29.000
Oh, you and laser tag.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:30.120
Fucking love laser tag.

01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:31.800
When was the last time you went to like a Qsar?

01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:32.680
It's been a while.

01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:33.480
Oh, that's too bad.

01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:34.680
I miss the Qsars.

01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:38.280
They still have that one in Vacaville, which is like the closest one sadly.

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.240
Yeah, I think they do, but it's just kind of.

01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:43.720
It's a sad shadow of its former self.

01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:44.520
Exactly.

01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:49.080
I mean, in the next closest ones in Concord or Pleasanton.

01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:51.100
I don't know.

01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:54.440
Well, if I can drive to Milpitas, go to the Great Mall.

01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:56.280
Well, I mean.

01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:57.240
And get shoes.

01:39:57.400 --> 01:40:00.360
It's not a matter of driving there because it's only like 45 minutes away, but

01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:02.520
it's just not worth it.

01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:04.840
It's just very, very much in disrepair.

01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:08.440
And it's Vacaville and like kind of a hick town.

01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:09.160
Vacaville.

01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:10.440
Yeah.

01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:13.160
Let's say you're playing with a bunch of redneck guys.

01:40:13.160 --> 01:40:14.600
And then you can go to the nut tree.

01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:17.320
Moving on.

01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:17.960
Sorry.

01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:19.560
I didn't mean to localize the show.

01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:20.060
Sorry.

01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:24.360
And in Portals, getting some DLC that they've hinted at a while back.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.160
It was a whole DLC that was kind of part of the.

01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:36.360
Was it the motion controller shit that they had on PC, but it never kind of took off.

01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:41.080
But now they have this whole move based motion stuff that they're kind of porting over from

01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:41.400
that.

01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:43.800
So it's the in motion DLC.

01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:47.960
It's going to come on November 6 for 10 bucks.

01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:51.160
And also, I guess the full game is also going to get move support as well.

01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:52.600
They're going to patch that in.

01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:58.920
And it was six cents was the company that made the original stuff.

01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:02.200
It's 20 new test chambers that you can play.

01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:04.760
And I guess they have new cubes that you can adjust the size of.

01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:09.240
And you can also move portals around stuff and rotate objects using the move controller.

01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:10.840
That might be fun.

01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:11.640
I have portal too.

01:41:11.640 --> 01:41:13.800
And I do have a move that I'm not using.

01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:16.120
So maybe.

01:41:16.120 --> 01:41:16.620
Maybe.

01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:18.760
All right.

01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:19.960
Moving on to some other news.

01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:23.240
We've been talking a little bit about the Mass Effect trilogy.

01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:25.320
It is also coming to the PlayStation 3.

01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:27.080
But you'll have to wait a little longer.

01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:30.760
December 4 is the date that was announced for Mass Effect trilogy on the PlayStation

01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:31.000
3.

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.440
That's December 7 in Europe.

01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:35.080
So at least it'll make it before Christmas.

01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:36.760
But it is going to be about a month behind.

01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:41.720
But I mean, a lot of people are waiting for the PlayStation debut of the original Mass

01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:43.480
Effect, which, of course, will be in the trilogy.

01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:47.480
Or you'll also be able to get it on the PlayStation Network.

01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:49.080
It's going to set you back 15 bucks.

01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:51.320
There's also excuse me.

01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:54.680
Oh, sneezing radio guy's worst enemy.

01:41:55.800 --> 01:41:59.320
There's also some detail on the DLC that's going to be included with the trilogy.

01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:04.200
All the Cerberus Network with Mass Effect 2, of course, on the PlayStation 3, though,

01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:08.920
you're going to get Lair of the Shadow Broker, Kasumi, which is like what you need most of

01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:11.240
all, and Overlord.

01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:12.600
You get do you get Zaid?

01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:14.600
It doesn't say Zaid and it doesn't say Arrival.

01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:16.760
So you don't get all of the place.

01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:19.480
Arrival was really necessary to the story.

01:42:20.120 --> 01:42:22.680
Well, they can get another 10 bucks out of you, though.

01:42:22.680 --> 01:42:25.720
Mass Effect 3 will have Cerberus Network, but not Leviathan.

01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:29.080
But I'm assuming it will have the multiplayer and all that good stuff.

01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:32.040
So that's that's one of the best features that keeps it going.

01:42:32.040 --> 01:42:32.680
So there you go.

01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:35.000
December 4th on the PlayStation 3.

01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:42.360
And I kind of want it just because I have I have the entire trilogy on 360, the entire

01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:43.240
trilogy on PC.

01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:48.200
I think I kind of owe it to myself to get the entire trilogy on PlayStation as well.

01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:49.240
Don't you agree, Loki?

01:42:49.480 --> 01:42:50.520
Don't you get my logic?

01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:51.640
Don't you understand me?

01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:52.140
Nope.

01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:57.400
There's a Wreck-It Ralph IOS game.

01:42:57.400 --> 01:43:00.520
If you were a fan of the movie, maybe you'll be a fan of the IOS game.

01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:05.080
It includes Fix-It Felix Junior, which is the game that the movie's about.

01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:09.000
I do want to point out, though, Fix-It Felix Junior is also a standalone app for free.

01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:13.960
This other app is 99 cents, and you can also get Sweet Climber.

01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:17.400
It has it's just inspired by Sugar Rush, but it's not a racing game.

01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:20.360
It's a bounce up the thing.

01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:24.680
It references the scene in the movie, but you tilt the controller or your controller.

01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:29.080
You tilt your iPhone back and forth or iPad or whatever to move him left and right.

01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:35.160
And then Hero's Duty is like a twin stick shooter, which was kind of neat, I guess,

01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:39.560
except the fact that there's no tangible joystick on the iPad, which is stupid.

01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:40.060
Unless.

01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:44.680
I don't know if it has IK support because it's a twin stick shooter.

01:43:45.560 --> 01:43:49.160
There's also, I'll tell you, I downloaded it because it's only 99 cents.

01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:49.560
What the hell?

01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:50.280
And I love the movie.

01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:56.040
There is also apparently Turbo Time is a game that's coming, but it's locked right now.

01:43:56.040 --> 01:43:57.080
It says coming soon.

01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:59.960
So there will be, it looks like a fourth game added into it.

01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:01.160
So pretty cool.

01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:03.800
If you're a fan of Wreck-It Ralph, the IOS game's out there right now.

01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:10.520
There was a wedding in gaming this week, and this is a pretty good one for the gaming industry.

01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:15.400
John Romero and Brenda Brathwaite actually got married.

01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:18.680
This is actually last weekend, but just the news came out this week.

01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:25.480
Get this, between the two of them, Doom, Wizardry, Quake, Commander Keen,

01:44:25.480 --> 01:44:27.720
Jagged Alliance, Wolfenstein 3D.

01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:32.360
Maybe this is why, wasn't she one of the two people behind that

01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:35.640
Kickstarter for like the old school RPG or something like that?

01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:37.880
I can't remember.

01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:39.560
I think she was, and maybe that's why.

01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:42.520
Her name came up on the show recently.

01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:46.600
Yeah, maybe that's why they closed down the whole Kickstarter for that.

01:44:46.600 --> 01:44:51.880
Well, they also established a social game studio together in 2010.

01:44:51.880 --> 01:44:54.840
Loot Drop was the studio that they co-founded together.

01:44:55.720 --> 01:45:01.400
They were married by id Software co-founder Tom Hall, which is pretty cute.

01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:04.840
And get this, Star Soccer, guess where they were married?

01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:07.720
Disneyland on the Steamboat.

01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:15.800
Oh, and then for their honeymoon, they went to hell and killed demons.

01:45:15.800 --> 01:45:16.280
Just kidding.

01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:17.000
And it was fun.

01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:17.640
And it was fun.

01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:19.800
All right, let's move on.

01:45:19.800 --> 01:45:21.240
Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?

01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:24.040
Some stuff, things.

01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:26.680
How about some Ragnarok stuff?

01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:30.280
The developer for Ragnarok is working and that's,

01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:32.680
God, I hate when my screen messes up like this.

01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:39.080
That's Kazuki Morishita, I believe, is working on a Nintendo 3DS title.

01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:43.400
They're not saying what it's going to be, but he works in Ragnarok.

01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:45.880
So hey, maybe it's more Ragnarok.

01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:53.960
Then in more news, Treasure is working on a Nintendo 3DS exclusive.

01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:59.080
So you know if Treasure's behind it, it's going to be fucking weird and pretty good.

01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:00.600
Weird and good.

01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:01.400
I mean, they did Gunstar Jokes.

01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:02.680
Fucking weird, but pretty good.

01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:03.320
Yeah.

01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:05.720
I don't think Treasure's ever put out any crap.

01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:06.220
So.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:20.040
And then, Cypress Hill's shag loses $250 million at the Grand Theft Auto lawsuit.

01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:28.680
Basically, he said that his likeness and life story was used to create the character CJ

01:46:29.320 --> 01:46:31.000
in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:34.120
And the judge said no.

01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:36.280
Sorry, you lose.

01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:38.920
Do not pass go lose $250 million.

01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:41.320
I don't think he lost $250 million.

01:46:41.320 --> 01:46:42.200
He lost the ability to win.

01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:44.360
He didn't win $250 million.

01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:47.080
But you can't lose what you didn't get.

01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:48.200
$250 million.

01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:50.120
Well, that and he had to pay for his court costs.

01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:51.240
So he's probably out something.

01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:52.440
He's out something.

01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:52.940
Yep.

01:46:53.320 --> 01:46:54.120
And you know what I say?

01:46:55.720 --> 01:46:58.360
That whole lawsuit was insane in the membrane.

01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:00.440
Womp womp.

01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:02.200
Okay, that's it.

01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:02.680
Oh, that's it.

01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:03.240
All right.

01:47:03.240 --> 01:47:05.640
Let's go to the FUGL question of the week.

01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:18.600
Take the words Facebook and Google as in plus and slam them together and you get FUGL.

01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:19.960
And that's where the statement comes from.

01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:24.280
It's where we ask our fan community is a question and get their answers.

01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:28.280
And of course, as everybody's talking about the movies, we had to make the FUGL question

01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:29.480
about Wreck-It Ralph.

01:47:29.480 --> 01:47:33.560
If the box office numbers are any indication, it looks like many of you saw Wreck-It Ralph

01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:34.120
this weekend.

01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:35.320
What'd you think of the movie?

01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:38.520
Was it a great thing for video games or were you not happy at the way things were done?

01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:41.960
Act Def starts us off on Google Plus saying, I loved it.

01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:43.400
Everything about it was great.

01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:45.480
The story, the cameos, the jokes, everything.

01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:47.320
Anyone who hasn't seen this movie should do so.

01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:47.800
It's great.

01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:50.120
It truly surpasses the Disney standards.

01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:51.960
Was it a great thing for video games?

01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:56.120
That I really do not know since the movie only has references to games and such, but

01:47:56.120 --> 01:48:00.200
it isn't a real video game movie like Silent Hill, for example.

01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:03.000
It's just a story set in a video game universe.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:06.680
But maybe it'll get people interested in retro gaming since most of the references are really

01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:07.960
from the old days of gaming.

01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:13.240
Elliot B. answers the question on Google and says, I was really excited about seeing it.

01:48:13.240 --> 01:48:14.680
The trailer looked great.

01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:18.760
Then I realized it's not out until February here in the UK.

01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:21.480
Here's something I want to just pose a question.

01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:24.520
Do you think there are kids growing up nowadays that don't know what an arcade is?

01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:30.360
You know, one thing I will fault the movie for is that it was a little, you did have

01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:34.360
to suspend disbelief that people were lining up at the arcade to get in when they'd open

01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:39.480
it in the morning and that it was as full as it looked because you and I, and she all

01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:41.320
know that arcades don't look like that anymore.

01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:43.400
Unfortunately, there's a water park attached.

01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:43.720
Yeah.

01:48:43.720 --> 01:48:44.520
Right.

01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:49.880
So, um, that you did have to suspend disbelief for a little bit, but are there kids growing

01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:51.560
up today that don't know what an arcade is?

01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:55.400
Um, no, because kids still have birthday parties at Chuck E Cheese and Dave and Bust, well,

01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:59.960
or whatever, all those types of places, bounce houses have arcades in them.

01:48:59.960 --> 01:49:01.880
Here's the, it's all ticket redemption.

01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:06.760
You have a few arcade games in there, but most of it's ticket redemption.

01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:08.120
Disneyland still has arcades.

01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:14.680
You know, there's arcades around, but it's just a lot of them tend to be the dollar experiences

01:49:14.680 --> 01:49:21.160
and, you know, they're driving games or, you know, gun games or whatever.

01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:24.680
Just very few of the fix it, Felix Jr.

01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:28.680
Type of games, which clearly was inspired by Donkey Kong and that type of stuff that,

01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:34.200
that type of experience doesn't really exist anymore, except maybe in the corner to get

01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:35.640
little use out of those old games.

01:49:37.720 --> 01:49:38.760
So Elliot wants to snow.

01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:40.840
He went and saw Skyfall instead.

01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:44.680
Now see, Skyfall is now here until this week and I really want to see it.

01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:47.720
Dan's been pissing himself over.

01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:51.720
I actually really like James Bond movies, so I'm kind of excited about Skyfall.

01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:54.040
Craig is pretty, he's a great Bond.

01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:54.680
He's great.

01:49:54.680 --> 01:49:55.560
I love his eyes.

01:49:56.360 --> 01:49:58.120
He'll be even better as Indiana Jones.

01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:02.200
Next up, E3VL.

01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:04.840
I guess that's evil on Google Plus.

01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:08.920
Loved the video game nostalgia, especially those happening in the background and emotional

01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:09.720
spikes.

01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:12.360
This film was like the Roger Rabbit of video games.

01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:16.920
Seems like the movie panders way too much to the old gen gamers, 20 plus years old with

01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:18.360
the video game references.

01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:22.840
Younger audiences may feel bored if it weren't for the Sugar Rush game and level puns.

01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:26.760
If you bring your kids, prepare for them to be confused and saddened in certain segments

01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:30.280
and jump for joy after wiped tears as its problems are resolved.

01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:35.160
Again, without spoiling too much though, the Sugar Rush thing kind of made up the majority

01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:37.160
of the movie.

01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:40.600
So I don't think kids, I don't think the references will be, I mean there's a lot of

01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:42.680
references are going to go over the kids heads.

01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:47.400
Like in the, in the, the baddie video game club, which is in the trailer, I'm not spoiling

01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:47.880
anything.

01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:51.480
The little like League of Villains baddie recovery group.

01:50:51.480 --> 01:50:54.440
Like kids will just get that they're villains.

01:50:54.440 --> 01:50:55.800
They'll get Zangief.

01:50:55.800 --> 01:50:56.840
They'll get Bison.

01:50:56.840 --> 01:50:59.640
Maybe, but they're not, the kids may not understand.

01:50:59.640 --> 01:51:01.400
I think they'll get Pac-Man as well.

01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:07.720
Why did, why did, why, you know, like there's a very obvious reference to Kano from Mortal

01:51:07.720 --> 01:51:08.200
Kombat.

01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:09.080
That is Kano.

01:51:09.080 --> 01:51:09.480
Yeah, I know.

01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:11.080
A very, very obvious reference.

01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:12.600
And I don't think kids are going to get it.

01:51:12.600 --> 01:51:14.280
The zombies from House of the Dead.

01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:15.720
Yeah, but adults get it.

01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:17.560
And you know who the purple rhino was?

01:51:18.120 --> 01:51:19.240
The embossed monster beast.

01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:21.720
With the fancy unicorns.

01:51:21.720 --> 01:51:23.240
Yeah, with fancy unicorns.

01:51:23.240 --> 01:51:29.000
But I mean, but I mean, for example, Becky's kid, he played Pac-Man.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:32.040
He knows Pac-Man because they had a little retro arcade thing.

01:51:32.040 --> 01:51:33.960
I mean, they have Pac-Man and Dave and Busters now.

01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:36.200
It's the, but it's Pac-Man Battle Royale, that whole thing.

01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:39.640
But I mean, there's, well, there's Pac-Man's in everything.

01:51:39.720 --> 01:51:41.880
It's sort of like ingrained into society now.

01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:44.920
All right, let's go to Facebook because we had some good answers on Facebook.

01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:48.760
Tiger Claw says, I think Wreck-It Ralph is hands down the best video game movie ever

01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:49.400
made.

01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:53.880
Given how well it's doing at the box office, I would hope Disney do a sequel or maybe turn

01:51:53.880 --> 01:51:58.360
it into an animated series a la Captain N. The film does a great job at establishing

01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:02.920
the universe so I could totally see more stories being told inside the video game world and

01:52:02.920 --> 01:52:05.560
show more of the video games that live inside it.

01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:07.400
I agree and I don't agree with you.

01:52:07.400 --> 01:52:13.400
I think there's the potential to do other movies in this universe that's been established,

01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:16.280
but I kind of draw the line at the Captain N thing.

01:52:16.280 --> 01:52:20.920
Remember, Mario's not in this movie because if Mario had been in the movie, it would have

01:52:20.920 --> 01:52:22.040
been about Mario.

01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:25.320
And the movie's not about the existing video game characters.

01:52:25.320 --> 01:52:29.560
They just, all the existing video game characters play supporting roles and that's what's

01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:30.280
really cool about it.

01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:32.680
But Nintendo, a Captain N video game would be pretty awesome.

01:52:33.560 --> 01:52:35.560
Captain N was absolute shit.

01:52:36.120 --> 01:52:39.240
Well, they can fix all the wrongs, you know, the 80s weird stuff.

01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:43.320
I mean, like Simon Belmont being all weird and stuff, but if they fix all that, it could

01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:44.280
be pretty cool.

01:52:44.280 --> 01:52:47.400
Xenocore in our chat room agrees with you, by the way, live.vognetwork.com.

01:52:47.400 --> 01:52:49.240
He says, Captain N, the hell you say?

01:52:49.240 --> 01:52:50.920
We can do better than Captain N.

01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:51.640
Mega high.

01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:58.840
Osfer says, honestly, I think Wreck-It Ralph did do well due to it being a Pixar film.

01:52:58.840 --> 01:53:00.440
I got fooled, buddy.

01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:01.320
He got fooled.

01:53:01.320 --> 01:53:02.760
It looks like a Pixar film.

01:53:02.760 --> 01:53:04.440
It was, look at the opening.

01:53:04.440 --> 01:53:06.200
It's the Disney classic studio.

01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:09.960
But it did have the Pixar logo right at the stop.

01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:12.840
Because it was produced by Lasseter.

01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:17.160
It was produced by one of the Pixar guys, although technically it's in the same, this

01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:22.840
is the same studio that did Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and more recently

01:53:22.840 --> 01:53:25.720
Tangled, which is a very similar film, also not Pixar.

01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:27.320
So it was produced by Lasseter.

01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:27.800
Right.

01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:32.920
So, I mean, it's just, you know, this is where Disney having bought Pixar, this is where

01:53:32.920 --> 01:53:35.400
you're really starting to see the fruits of them coming together.

01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:40.280
But Brave was the Pixar film from this year and Monsters, you or whatever, is their big

01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:41.080
movie next year.

01:53:42.520 --> 01:53:47.320
And I think the next Disney movie, the Disney classic movie next year is The Frozen.

01:53:47.320 --> 01:53:47.640
Yeah.

01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:48.200
Right.

01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:49.480
So, all right.

01:53:49.480 --> 01:53:51.480
Anyhow, continuing on with Osfer's comment.

01:53:51.480 --> 01:53:53.560
I didn't mean to, like, I'm not like calling you out or anything.

01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:56.360
I'm just saying you made a mistake a lot of people are making.

01:53:56.440 --> 01:53:58.760
And Pixar movies are great.

01:53:58.760 --> 01:54:00.200
Maybe that was intentional.

01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:05.560
You know, there really is not a bad Pixar movie unless it was a sequel to a mediocre

01:54:05.560 --> 01:54:06.200
one.

01:54:06.200 --> 01:54:06.520
All right.

01:54:07.080 --> 01:54:11.080
Those are usually the most hyped up films and it's rare to turn on the TV without seeing

01:54:11.080 --> 01:54:12.280
an ad for the movie.

01:54:12.280 --> 01:54:17.000
It's my opinion that the movie that truly did well for video games went overlooked.

01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:22.440
Silent Hill Revelation was the closest video game to film adaptation I've ever seen and

01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:25.000
future video game related movies could learn from it.

01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:26.040
Which reminds me.

01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:26.920
We still need to go see it.

01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:29.320
I have another friend that wants to see it too.

01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:29.880
Okay.

01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:32.600
So we'll try to make that happen this week.

01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:36.600
Yeah, I can't really respond to that because I haven't seen Silent Hill Revelation still.

01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:38.120
It's on my radar.

01:54:38.120 --> 01:54:39.560
I want to get that scene this week.

01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:42.680
So I'll have to come back to that next week.

01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:49.000
DDR Dollar Bill says I would have seen it if I had power but wanted to wonder if anyone

01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:53.400
else noticed how some reviewers were comparing this to Who Framed Roger Rabbit and that you

01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:56.680
saw multiple characters from different franchises in the same movie.

01:54:56.680 --> 01:55:01.640
You know, I didn't think I liked that comparison at first, but now I think I do because again

01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:05.080
in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, none of those characters were the star.

01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:10.920
It was about, you know, Roger Rabbit and Christopher Lloyd's wacky character and all that

01:55:10.920 --> 01:55:11.400
stuff.

01:55:11.400 --> 01:55:12.520
So, and Jessica Rabbit.

01:55:12.520 --> 01:55:14.120
You can't forget Jessica Rabbit.

01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:15.560
It was really Eddie's story.

01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:16.680
I guess that's true.

01:55:16.680 --> 01:55:18.520
It's been years since I've seen that movie.

01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:22.200
If you keep in mind the story it was based off of, Roger was dead.

01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:28.760
All right, moving on to Dark Charger who says I saw this with my young son yesterday.

01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:31.720
It's a great video game movie and a good movie overall.

01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:35.720
While it doesn't belong in the pantheon of animated films, it is a great love letter

01:55:35.720 --> 01:55:39.720
to every sort of gamer, especially to those that live through the golden age of the arcade

01:55:39.720 --> 01:55:41.800
who may enjoy this film even more.

01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:46.600
I think that it drives strength in its narrative by not simply focusing on video games, but

01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:48.840
by not forgetting about the characters.

01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:49.720
It's a pretty good review.

01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:51.800
Before I forget.

01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:52.280
Yeah.

01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:55.240
The original story was who censored Roger Rabbit.

01:55:55.240 --> 01:55:55.960
I'd forgotten.

01:55:55.960 --> 01:55:57.480
I thought it was plugged, but no word.

01:55:57.480 --> 01:55:58.040
All right.

01:55:58.040 --> 01:56:00.920
Chiggers replied and said, I really liked Wreck-It Ralph.

01:56:00.920 --> 01:56:05.880
My only complaint is that I wish they would have had more of the other classic game character.

01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:06.760
Excuse me.

01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:10.200
I think you meant to say more of the classic game characters had more of a role.

01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:16.840
I respect their decision to not do that because I think it would have taken away.

01:56:17.640 --> 01:56:23.800
It was very interesting to me that one of the media supporting roles went to, and again,

01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:24.920
I don't think this is spoiling anything.

01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:26.040
I think I'm okay saying this.

01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:31.160
One of the media supporting roles went to Qbert because Qbert's one of those characters

01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:39.800
where it's like, he's not a Mario or a Sonic per se, but he's very recognizable.

01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:43.640
If you were alive in the eighties or if you have a knowledge of eighties gaming, you know

01:56:43.640 --> 01:56:44.520
what I mean?

01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:45.880
Like, did you kind of feel that way, Jamie?

01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:49.160
That was a very interesting character to have be a supporting character.

01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:49.640
Yeah.

01:56:49.640 --> 01:56:51.000
Yeah, but it worked.

01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:56.360
So anyhow, let's see, moving on.

01:56:56.360 --> 01:57:00.920
The Rob D says it's undoubtedly a great thing for video games and gamers alike.

01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:05.800
It's the first time that a company on the scale of Disney has deftly waived a great

01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:09.880
story involving video games without resorting to cheap sensationalism.

01:57:09.880 --> 01:57:14.600
As a lifelong gamer, I find it refreshing to see them treated as the creative medium

01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:18.760
and source of enjoyment for so many that they are, not something that only nerds and

01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:20.200
basement dwellers partake in.

01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:22.600
For me, the bottom line is this.

01:57:22.600 --> 01:57:26.360
Wreck-It Ralph treats both video games and gamers with respect.

01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:30.680
The people who created it did a wonderful job of capturing the joy of games and the

01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:32.600
world's Wii gamers experience.

01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:36.360
This is the first time that's ever happened and they should be lauded for it.

01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:39.640
Let's hope that this is the start of a trend and not an aberration.

01:57:39.640 --> 01:57:41.640
That's a very solid comment.

01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:42.200
I like that.

01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:45.720
Uh, one more comment here from Degenerate Johnny.

01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:48.120
This is also a very interesting comment.

01:57:48.120 --> 01:57:51.880
I like this one a lot and this is the last one I'm going to read here from Facebook.com

01:57:51.880 --> 01:57:53.480
slash Orange Lounge Radio.

01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:57.720
Degenerate Johnny says, I will admit that the movie was quite entertaining and I think

01:57:57.720 --> 01:58:01.400
that it places video games in a better light, which is something the industry needs.

01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:05.320
However, I'm not sure if Wreck-It Ralph is a good thing for the progression of video

01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:06.040
games.

01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:10.280
The industry has grown up considerably since its inception, but it is still considered

01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:14.760
by many media outlets, i.e. Fox News and CNN as a child's toy.

01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:19.560
Therefore, having a successful family-friendly video game movie may be a form of support

01:58:19.560 --> 01:58:23.720
to those who heavily criticize the industry for its violent games.

01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:28.280
Interactive entertainment is the entertainment of this age, as was Motion Pictures, the

01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:30.440
entertainment of the industrial age.

01:58:30.440 --> 01:58:34.280
Honestly, I don't think that it's fair to interpret an entertainment industry based

01:58:34.280 --> 01:58:37.240
on its interactions with other forms of entertainment.

01:58:37.800 --> 01:58:42.200
We don't interpret William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet through that horrid excuse

01:58:42.200 --> 01:58:44.440
of a movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio.

01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:47.800
The views and opinions of OLR's fans do not reflect that of OLR.

01:58:47.800 --> 01:58:48.680
Damn right they don't.

01:58:48.680 --> 01:58:49.640
I love that movie.

01:58:49.640 --> 01:58:50.280
I'm sorry.

01:58:50.280 --> 01:58:53.480
I hate that play so much because they're both stupid.

01:58:53.480 --> 01:58:56.680
I do agree there's better Shakespeare plays than Romeo and Juliet for sure.

01:58:56.680 --> 01:58:56.920
Really?

01:58:56.920 --> 01:58:57.880
The theme of that?

01:58:57.880 --> 01:58:58.680
Hi, we're stupid.

01:58:58.680 --> 01:58:59.400
Let's kill each other.

01:58:59.400 --> 01:58:59.720
The end.

01:59:00.680 --> 01:59:04.840
Wreck-It Ralph was simply a fun-filled children's movie that I hope to God will only be viewed

01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:09.720
as such if interactive entertainment is to be accepted as the next form of entertainment.

01:59:10.280 --> 01:59:13.960
I thought that was a very interesting comment because of the whole, and this is the part

01:59:13.960 --> 01:59:18.280
that really got me, I don't think it's fair to interpret an entertainment industry based

01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:21.560
on its interactions with other forms of entertainment.

01:59:21.560 --> 01:59:23.080
What do you think about that statement?

01:59:23.080 --> 01:59:25.000
Do you think that's a good statement that he's making there?

01:59:26.120 --> 01:59:31.320
It does seem like, it does seem like gamers, especially in gaming blogs and the things

01:59:31.320 --> 01:59:36.280
we read on the internet, it does seem like gamers are really obsessed with how does the

01:59:36.280 --> 01:59:38.040
news report on us?

01:59:38.040 --> 01:59:40.600
How do we get portrayed in movies?

01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:46.360
What, you know, it does seem like that always peaks a curiosity and in this comment that's

01:59:46.360 --> 01:59:50.680
kind of being called out as to why do we do that?

01:59:50.680 --> 01:59:56.360
What other industry has success measured on how it's interpreted in other forms of art?

01:59:58.280 --> 01:59:59.720
I just thought it was a neat way of looking at it.

02:00:01.320 --> 02:00:05.560
Mm hmm.

02:00:07.720 --> 02:00:11.000
It's very kind of, it actually strikes me as somewhat abstract.

02:00:11.960 --> 02:00:12.360
Yeah.

02:00:12.360 --> 02:00:21.480
I mean, if you look at taking one genre and portraying it in another genre, then any type

02:00:21.480 --> 02:00:29.880
of biography about artists, about, shoot, toy story, toys coming to life and, and doing

02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:30.280
stuff.

02:00:31.800 --> 02:00:32.760
I guess that's true.

02:00:32.760 --> 02:00:37.000
Some, some forms of art need each other to exist.

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:41.640
And I might be, I might be going way off the page of what this commenter intended.

02:00:41.640 --> 02:00:42.600
So I apologize.

02:00:43.160 --> 02:00:46.280
But some forms of entertainment need each other to exist.

02:00:46.280 --> 02:00:54.040
For example, music and movies, because silent movies were way different than movies today.

02:00:54.040 --> 02:00:59.000
Hell, even when there was silent movies, you needed, uh, the piano guy sitting there at

02:00:59.000 --> 02:01:03.480
the front playing, you know, those two industries have always really needed each other.

02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:06.440
And some of the best music was inspired by movies.

02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:13.000
Or have you, well, music just goes with, like, here's going to be a really dumb example.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:15.320
Have you ever written California Screamin' without the soundtrack?

02:01:16.040 --> 02:01:16.360
Yeah.

02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:17.560
When my chair was broken.

02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:19.960
Was it not a little different?

02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:21.320
It was not as good.

02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:22.040
Yeah.

02:01:22.040 --> 02:01:24.920
Or changing the music and things.

02:01:24.920 --> 02:01:30.360
That's why I really like how a lot of times for showing a suspenseful part in a movie

02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:36.600
or a game, they'll just use silence instead of, you know, they'll let you focus on the

02:01:36.600 --> 02:01:41.400
sounds going on, not just, you know, scary music to let you know it's scary.

02:01:44.040 --> 02:01:48.520
And of course, we'll end it on this comment in the chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

02:01:48.520 --> 02:01:52.200
Xenocore says, Rob, the answer to your question is porn.

02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:56.920
And Robert M. also says that there are a lot of classic toys in Toy Story.

02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:04.440
You know, what about books?

02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:06.680
I mean, we've kind of had the Neverending Story.

02:02:06.680 --> 02:02:07.240
What was that?

02:02:07.240 --> 02:02:08.280
The Page Master?

02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:10.760
I mean, that people were into that movie.

02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:19.480
I hate to say it, you know, you had or even take comics, you know, take different genre

02:02:19.480 --> 02:02:22.680
of story and like, for example, the whole Fable series.

02:02:23.320 --> 02:02:26.600
Actually, you just you just really hit on something because something that's really

02:02:26.600 --> 02:02:32.760
huge now that wasn't as big years ago was the comics and movies.

02:02:32.760 --> 02:02:34.600
That's like a huge thing in the industry now.

02:02:34.600 --> 02:02:40.840
And really, like before the past few years, like you would occasionally have like Superman

02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:46.520
was huge in the 70s and like Batman was huge in the 90s, the Burton series.

02:02:46.520 --> 02:02:51.640
But like comics are kind of big in movies now in a way we haven't seen.

02:02:51.640 --> 02:02:53.560
I have a reason to see Guardians of the Galaxy now.

02:02:54.120 --> 02:02:54.840
Rocket Raccoon.

02:02:56.040 --> 02:03:00.440
Anyway, but well, the whole reason I think with that and also why I think Rocket Ralph

02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:09.560
is doing well is that the audience, the target audience being also the same age group of

02:03:09.560 --> 02:03:14.440
an audience that's going to have the money and, you know, maybe have kids, but also be

02:03:14.440 --> 02:03:15.720
the people who are going to get it.

02:03:16.520 --> 02:03:19.000
That's the ones you want to market to is our age demographic.

02:03:20.280 --> 02:03:25.880
And on top of that, we grew up, I grew up reading X-Men and Avengers, you know, I didn't

02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:27.560
read DC because DC sucks.

02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:33.480
Sorry, my allergies, my sinus infections getting the best of me.

02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:37.720
But, you know, we grew up playing these games.

02:03:37.720 --> 02:03:41.640
It's we are at the age that we are the ones with money and the influence.

02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:45.480
Not in the corporate world, of course, because that's bullshit.

02:03:46.200 --> 02:03:46.700
Occupy.

02:03:48.040 --> 02:03:57.400
But as far as what dictates what's popular in pop culture, in modern popular culture,

02:03:58.520 --> 02:03:59.480
we're the age group.

02:04:01.240 --> 02:04:03.880
There are too many deep discussions happening on tonight's show.

02:04:03.880 --> 02:04:04.440
I don't understand.

02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:04.760
What is it?

02:04:04.760 --> 02:04:05.880
What is in the air tonight?

02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:08.120
Where am I taking fart jokes that I came here for?

02:04:08.120 --> 02:04:09.240
I don't get it.

02:04:09.240 --> 02:04:09.880
Don't worry.

02:04:09.880 --> 02:04:11.800
My next story has raccoon penis in it.

02:04:11.800 --> 02:04:13.080
OK, phew.

02:04:13.080 --> 02:04:15.560
Well, before we get to your story, then we got to do a couple more.

02:04:15.560 --> 02:04:16.920
So let's get back into some news.

02:04:16.920 --> 02:04:20.760
Loki, we will be opening up the Skype line later if you want to call and voice your opinion

02:04:20.760 --> 02:04:21.560
on any of this.

02:04:21.560 --> 02:04:25.400
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.

02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:25.960
Sorry, Loki.

02:04:25.960 --> 02:04:28.520
I needed to plug that before we get to the problem.

02:04:29.160 --> 02:04:35.800
Since a lot of the whole online plan for the Wii U has been kind of nonexistent or hidden

02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:41.560
or secret or whatever, it is kind of refreshing to see that there's some information, including

02:04:41.560 --> 02:04:43.240
now what their web browser is going to be.

02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:48.280
And I don't know if there's anything to really be excited about, but well, here we go.

02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:54.280
So basically it's based off the whole net front browser, which has been used in pretty

02:04:54.280 --> 02:05:01.240
much all the portable gaming systems, the DS, 3DS, PSP, Vita, and of course, you know,

02:05:01.240 --> 02:05:01.800
the Wii U.

02:05:04.040 --> 02:05:08.760
It's based a little bit off of, you know, they've got Mozilla kind of backing a little

02:05:08.760 --> 02:05:10.520
bit of the Apple WebKit as well.

02:05:12.120 --> 02:05:16.360
And then a little bit of, I guess, the Nintendo browser, which is good or bad.

02:05:16.360 --> 02:05:18.360
It will support HTML5.

02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:23.000
Of course, no Flash because, you know, everyone's kind of saying HTML5 is the way to go anyways.

02:05:23.880 --> 02:05:28.360
Because if we had Flash, we'd be able to play all of those virtual console games for free.

02:05:28.360 --> 02:05:30.200
And Nintendo has to know this.

02:05:30.200 --> 02:05:31.160
They have to know this.

02:05:31.160 --> 02:05:31.960
Of course, of course.

02:05:31.960 --> 02:05:44.760
It's going to support MP4 files as well as live streaming, MPEG4, AVC video, the H.2.64

02:05:45.560 --> 02:05:47.880
format, although some may not be playable.

02:05:47.880 --> 02:05:56.520
And of course, it will support, you know, just the regular level HTML4, 5, XHTML 1.1,

02:05:56.520 --> 02:06:01.960
CSS 1, 2, or 2.1 and 3, although those are partially functioning.

02:06:01.960 --> 02:06:03.560
I guess 3 is partially functioning.

02:06:04.120 --> 02:06:11.880
And they say even like video web storage is partially functioning, web messaging, and

02:06:12.680 --> 02:06:13.640
some other stuff there.

02:06:16.120 --> 02:06:20.360
No plugins, obviously, because it's built into the system there.

02:06:20.360 --> 02:06:25.240
And I guess they're saying that the browser will support some, you know, touch events

02:06:25.240 --> 02:06:28.360
stuff like a touch, start, touch, and move, cancel.

02:06:28.360 --> 02:06:30.760
I'm assuming it's all the stuff that you would have with a touchpad.

02:06:30.760 --> 02:06:31.800
Here's the thing.

02:06:31.800 --> 02:06:35.640
Will it be fast and responsive and easy?

02:06:35.640 --> 02:06:40.600
Because the problem with so many of these browsers on the TV and all this stuff is that

02:06:40.600 --> 02:06:42.200
they run like shit.

02:06:42.200 --> 02:06:45.480
It's faster to just whip my phone out of my pocket and get what I need.

02:06:45.480 --> 02:06:53.160
Well, they're saying right now that it's supposed to be, I guess, you know, it does

02:06:53.160 --> 02:06:54.920
support HTML 5.

02:06:54.920 --> 02:07:01.000
And I guess because it renders HTML 5 websites more effectively than any other console, and

02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:08.360
they say even faster than Internet Explorer, they're saying that it's pretty good, I guess.

02:07:09.240 --> 02:07:14.360
That's good because Internet Explorer on Xbox kind of blows because I mean, it's one of

02:07:14.360 --> 02:07:16.280
the better browsers a system has had yet.

02:07:16.280 --> 02:07:21.240
But like, it's so irritating that like when you go to vognetwork.com, even though we have

02:07:21.240 --> 02:07:25.640
an HTML 5 player that will work on a smartphone, it will not work on the Xbox.

02:07:25.640 --> 02:07:29.880
Like, OK, for example, they've got they have these ranking sites and I don't really know

02:07:29.880 --> 02:07:35.080
how they got this information, but it's HTML 5 test and they have a gaming tab on there.

02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:41.000
And right now, you know, the two I mean, there's not a lot of gaming browsers that support

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:44.040
HTML 5 through the 3DS and Xbox 360.

02:07:44.040 --> 02:07:48.120
3DS got a 109, Xbox 360 is a 120.

02:07:48.120 --> 02:07:52.680
And then, of course, the other browsers right now, I guess we does support a little bit

02:07:52.680 --> 02:07:58.680
that we got a 94 in the DSI, a 94 in the Vita, a 58.

02:07:59.960 --> 02:08:05.240
You know, in the course right now, they're saying, although it lists the Vita again,

02:08:05.240 --> 02:08:10.040
I guess, for HTML 5, maybe that's like HTML 4 scores or something like that.

02:08:10.040 --> 02:08:14.760
But for in the future or in development, the Wii U, a 323.

02:08:15.400 --> 02:08:19.800
And I guess the Vita is a 243, I'm assuming that's maybe an update or something.

02:08:19.800 --> 02:08:22.680
So I don't know, like I said, where they're getting their

02:08:22.680 --> 02:08:25.880
information as far as how they're scoring that.

02:08:25.880 --> 02:08:30.120
But. Interesting, I guess.

02:08:31.640 --> 02:08:35.480
I'm trying to see if there's any other comparisons with like tablets.

02:08:35.480 --> 02:08:38.120
OK, so let's let's look at tablets real quick.

02:08:38.120 --> 02:08:41.480
And as you would expect, the tablets are better.

02:08:42.200 --> 02:08:45.160
You know, the 323 is the Wii U's benchmark there.

02:08:45.160 --> 02:08:49.320
And right now, you know, they have Opera Mobile 12.

02:08:49.320 --> 02:08:51.880
That's a 406 and Chrome's 390.

02:08:53.880 --> 02:08:56.120
Trying to see what else would be the closest there.

02:08:57.400 --> 02:09:00.680
Even Windows Phone 8 is close 320.

02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:03.480
IOS 6 is a 386.

02:09:03.480 --> 02:09:05.400
Firefox mobile 388.

02:09:05.400 --> 02:09:10.760
So it does sound like that your phone's going to be better at, you know, rendering those

02:09:10.760 --> 02:09:12.760
pages, but it's not.

02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:14.760
Not as bad even.

02:09:15.400 --> 02:09:17.560
Fuck, even TV's are better at.

02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:21.800
But for gaming out of gaming consoles, it is the best.

02:09:22.600 --> 02:09:23.320
I don't know.

02:09:23.320 --> 02:09:23.880
I don't know.

02:09:23.880 --> 02:09:26.920
I don't know if that's really saying much, but all right.

02:09:28.040 --> 02:09:29.960
When I can get my hands on it and try it.

02:09:29.960 --> 02:09:32.840
That's when I can't really say say one way or the other.

02:09:32.840 --> 02:09:34.200
Yeah, I just like a three.

02:09:34.200 --> 02:09:35.320
I don't even know where they're getting.

02:09:35.320 --> 02:09:38.520
Like it doesn't say what they're what they're testing.

02:09:38.520 --> 02:09:43.480
I don't really know what they're testing and how how they're even testing it.

02:09:43.480 --> 02:09:45.000
A system that's not out yet.

02:09:46.440 --> 02:09:46.680
All right.

02:09:46.680 --> 02:09:51.080
I have some potpourri news involving Nintendo, and it means I have a few little things I

02:09:51.080 --> 02:09:51.800
want to get out here.

02:09:52.600 --> 02:09:57.640
One of them is about some finally some details on what exactly the Nintendo Network premium

02:09:57.640 --> 02:09:58.120
involves.

02:09:58.840 --> 02:10:03.160
You remember the Wii U Deluxe Edition that has Nintendo Land as a packing game also gets

02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:05.400
this whole Nintendo Network premium.

02:10:05.400 --> 02:10:07.000
So what the hell is this all about?

02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:13.480
Well, basically, you get 10% back in points that you spend on the Wii U shop.

02:10:13.480 --> 02:10:18.600
So if you get the 32 gig Wii U with the game, you get Nintendo Network premium and you get

02:10:18.600 --> 02:10:22.440
10% back in points if you buy a Wii U game on the eShop.

02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:25.480
So let's say you buy a game for $59.99.

02:10:26.040 --> 02:10:28.280
10% of that's $5.99 points.

02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:29.400
So there you go.

02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:33.080
You get $5 in eShop credit for every 500 points.

02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:40.760
So, you know, basically buying a game like what?

02:10:40.760 --> 02:10:47.880
New Super Mario Brothers Wii U online would get you enough points to buy the original

02:10:47.880 --> 02:10:49.400
Mario Brothers on the Virtual Console.

02:10:50.760 --> 02:10:53.160
You know, so a little something there.

02:10:53.160 --> 02:10:57.480
It's very similar to what the Vita does already, where you get 10% off.

02:10:57.480 --> 02:11:02.600
But that 10% that you save is not tied to their store.

02:11:02.600 --> 02:11:09.480
It's just money in your pocket versus having this money, you know, be honestly, I don't

02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:11.720
see downloading games as kind of an option.

02:11:11.720 --> 02:11:15.560
I mean, I don't know, like with how fickle I get with games and stuff like that.

02:11:15.560 --> 02:11:19.720
Like you would want to have the option to sell it back or something.

02:11:19.720 --> 02:11:23.960
And I just there's not really much that of an incentive, I guess.

02:11:24.680 --> 02:11:25.000
All right.

02:11:25.000 --> 02:11:27.640
Some details coming out on New Super Mario Brothers U.

02:11:28.600 --> 02:11:32.280
There is some more information on some of the different modes in the game,

02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:37.640
including challenge mode, where you will have to do specific objectives like get the course

02:11:37.640 --> 02:11:41.960
without touching the ground once or without ever picking up a coin.

02:11:42.680 --> 02:11:47.320
There's categories that include time attack, coin collection, one up rally and special,

02:11:47.320 --> 02:11:49.000
which is basically miscellaneous.

02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:52.680
There's also boost mode challenges that will require two players.

02:11:52.680 --> 02:11:56.840
Once you complete a challenge, a replay is saved so you can show that off.

02:11:56.840 --> 02:12:00.600
There's also coin battle where up to four players will go through the course and see

02:12:00.600 --> 02:12:01.960
who can collect the most coins.

02:12:02.440 --> 02:12:05.240
Not unlike the recent 3DS release.

02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:12.600
Another player can use the Wii U game pad in boost mode to place boost blocks to help

02:12:12.600 --> 02:12:14.840
grab a hard to reach coin.

02:12:14.840 --> 02:12:20.520
You can use the game pad to edit and customize the coin layout in dedicated courses.

02:12:20.520 --> 02:12:25.160
That layout can then be saved and played by players using the Wii remote controllers.

02:12:27.480 --> 02:12:30.040
At least that sounds kind of new and interesting.

02:12:30.040 --> 02:12:31.880
I'm curious how that plays out.

02:12:31.880 --> 02:12:32.760
Coins everywhere!

02:12:34.520 --> 02:12:35.160
World map.

02:12:36.120 --> 02:12:42.040
This is the first game since Super Mario World that is a seamless world map with named worlds

02:12:42.040 --> 02:12:45.240
and courses, secret exits which can change the map.

02:12:45.240 --> 02:12:48.600
So it sounds like it's really modeled off of Super Mario World.

02:12:48.600 --> 02:12:49.480
Not a bad thing.

02:12:50.520 --> 02:12:51.640
And nabbit.

02:12:52.440 --> 02:12:56.280
A creature named nabbit from time to time will appear on the world map if you enter

02:12:56.280 --> 02:13:00.520
the course and catch nabbit to recover items stolen from Toad.

02:13:01.160 --> 02:13:05.720
If you get nabbit you get a P acorn which will allow you to fly continuously through

02:13:05.720 --> 02:13:06.600
an entire stage.

02:13:06.600 --> 02:13:10.040
I'm assuming that is like the P wing from Mario 3.

02:13:12.600 --> 02:13:13.800
And one other thing.

02:13:14.520 --> 02:13:17.800
You know, Loki, you give Nintendo a lot of shit on this show.

02:13:17.800 --> 02:13:20.680
But you got to applaud Nintendo for this comment this week.

02:13:21.640 --> 02:13:28.120
Satoru Iwata in talking about Animal Crossing New Leaf on the Nintendo 3DS mentioning all

02:13:28.120 --> 02:13:34.760
of the download content will be free because charging consumers for the DLC would not be

02:13:34.760 --> 02:13:35.160
cool.

02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:40.600
Quote, that sort of element paid DLC is absolutely not being added.

02:13:40.600 --> 02:13:43.480
He went so far as to call it unwholesome.

02:13:43.480 --> 02:13:47.800
So basically like, you know, they could have charged for new patterns and silly.

02:13:47.800 --> 02:13:48.600
They're not going to do it.

02:13:49.880 --> 02:13:53.160
They thought about it, but they decided not to do it.

02:13:54.040 --> 02:13:58.920
Loki, Nintendo's biggest critic on this show, wasn't that the right call to make?

02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:02.840
Well, yeah, it's the most common sense call to make.

02:14:02.840 --> 02:14:07.640
And let's be honest, the first party companies aren't really the ones that are being known

02:14:07.640 --> 02:14:09.320
for all this on disc content.

02:14:09.320 --> 02:14:13.640
I don't think that Sony has a whole lot of games that kind of nickel and dime you for

02:14:13.640 --> 02:14:14.200
things.

02:14:14.200 --> 02:14:18.840
And I don't think that Microsoft has any similar games like that as well.

02:14:18.840 --> 02:14:20.120
So cool.

02:14:20.120 --> 02:14:22.280
You're on equal standing with everybody else.

02:14:22.360 --> 02:14:23.320
Third party companies.

02:14:23.320 --> 02:14:25.320
Well, that's a whole nother story.

02:14:25.320 --> 02:14:28.040
They're kind of in their own ruleset, I guess.

02:14:29.640 --> 02:14:31.240
All right, let's move on.

02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:31.880
Dar Sakura.

02:14:33.080 --> 02:14:37.320
Well, I brought it up.

02:14:37.960 --> 02:14:39.000
I said it was true.

02:14:39.640 --> 02:14:41.400
This story has to do with Raccoon Penis.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:45.880
What does Raccoon Penis have to do with video games?

02:14:45.880 --> 02:14:52.920
It actually has to do with a digital art group called Massive Black.

02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:59.880
And they've done a lot of concept art for Lord of the Rings Online, Infamous 2, Silent

02:14:59.880 --> 02:15:01.880
Hill Shattered Memories, and Transformers 3.

02:15:02.760 --> 02:15:05.720
They also developed their own game.

02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:12.440
They have an artistic demo out called Moth Head that they're using to show the Unity

02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:12.920
platform.

02:15:13.320 --> 02:15:17.320
I downloaded this because, honestly, I had heard of the art piece that it was based off

02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:17.880
of.

02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:29.080
It's based off of a sculpture that is, well, it has a giant phallus on it made from the

02:15:29.080 --> 02:15:30.840
real bone of a raccoon penis.

02:15:32.040 --> 02:15:36.120
And if no one believes me, I will pull up the image and show everybody.

02:15:36.120 --> 02:15:37.240
Oh, no, no, I believe you.

02:15:37.240 --> 02:15:37.720
It's fine.

02:15:37.720 --> 02:15:43.640
But they've done a demo called Moth Head, which is what the figure is called.

02:15:43.640 --> 02:15:48.280
And basically, it's the figure headless with a moth attached to it.

02:15:48.280 --> 02:15:54.440
You basically play as a moth going through this cavern, and then you merge with the creature

02:15:55.000 --> 02:16:01.240
that looks like it was put together with different materials, and has kind of shiny insect skin.

02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:03.640
And you solve puzzles as this creature.

02:16:03.720 --> 02:16:09.080
It's actually supposed to be similar to, and I'm going to mispronounce this as Botanicula,

02:16:09.080 --> 02:16:09.560
I think.

02:16:11.240 --> 02:16:12.680
It's still a demo.

02:16:12.680 --> 02:16:14.040
I mean, the controls aren't great.

02:16:14.040 --> 02:16:15.080
I downloaded it.

02:16:15.720 --> 02:16:20.200
It was originally conceived as a full length game, and they still want to do it.

02:16:20.200 --> 02:16:27.160
But right now, it's sort of on hold while they finish their client's work, because they

02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:30.680
still have huge groups that they're doing artwork for.

02:16:30.760 --> 02:16:32.520
It's absolutely gorgeous to me.

02:16:32.520 --> 02:16:40.520
I freaking love concept art, and just the fact that they would take this sculpture and

02:16:40.520 --> 02:16:44.520
turn it into a figure in a game, just is sort of like combining two of my favorite things.

02:16:45.160 --> 02:16:47.400
Find modern art and video games.

02:16:47.400 --> 02:16:52.040
I'll post the link of the image in the chat room.

02:16:53.560 --> 02:16:54.120
All right.

02:16:54.120 --> 02:16:55.240
Let's move on, Loki.

02:16:55.240 --> 02:16:55.740
All right.

02:16:56.600 --> 02:16:58.840
So I don't know.

02:16:58.840 --> 02:17:04.360
We talked about, we talked a lot about recent video, I don't even really call it a video

02:17:04.360 --> 02:17:06.920
game movie, but a video game based movie.

02:17:08.600 --> 02:17:11.800
Let's talk about another one that probably won't turn out as well.

02:17:11.800 --> 02:17:16.040
And that would be Castle Wolfenstein, the movie.

02:17:16.040 --> 02:17:21.480
Apparently, they've got Roger Avery back on his role as the writer and director for

02:17:21.480 --> 02:17:21.980
the movie.

02:17:22.520 --> 02:17:27.960
And this was a movie that was announced, what, five years ago?

02:17:31.080 --> 02:17:38.120
So, yeah, I don't know if anyone's going to even remember what Castle Wolfenstein was,

02:17:38.120 --> 02:17:43.320
at least any teenagers be seeing such a movie, but-

02:17:43.320 --> 02:17:44.200
Doom level skip.

02:17:46.200 --> 02:17:46.760
I don't know.

02:17:47.640 --> 02:17:52.200
But anyways, their plot, if we must go back in there, a young U.S.

02:17:52.200 --> 02:17:59.160
Army captain and British special agent are on a top secret mission to Castle Wolfenstein

02:17:59.160 --> 02:18:01.160
where Hitler, who is a young U.S.

02:18:01.160 --> 02:18:08.040
Army captain and British special agent, are on a top secret mission to Castle Wolfenstein

02:18:08.040 --> 02:18:11.400
where Hitler will be unveiling a new secret weapon.

02:18:12.760 --> 02:18:13.960
That sounds awfully generic.

02:18:13.960 --> 02:18:16.760
Does this mean the Hitler robot that was the boss of one of the-

02:18:16.760 --> 02:18:17.400
I hope so.

02:18:17.400 --> 02:18:17.960
Oh, boy.

02:18:19.560 --> 02:18:20.440
It could be.

02:18:20.440 --> 02:18:22.040
I think it could be dumb fun.

02:18:22.040 --> 02:18:24.120
As long as it's not attached to it, which he is.

02:18:24.120 --> 02:18:25.160
Emphasis on dumb.

02:18:26.520 --> 02:18:27.020
Yeah.

02:18:28.200 --> 02:18:28.520
All right.

02:18:28.520 --> 02:18:30.280
Well, I think this is kind of neat.

02:18:30.280 --> 02:18:36.360
Now, you know, Sega is no stranger to repackaging their old shit and they've done it a lot, a

02:18:36.360 --> 02:18:37.080
lot.

02:18:37.080 --> 02:18:43.640
And, you know, the various collections, whether it be download, PC, or these little hook them

02:18:43.640 --> 02:18:45.640
up directly to your TV things, right?

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:49.080
There's a new one on the way out.

02:18:49.080 --> 02:18:54.040
It's called the Sega Genesis Ultimate Portable Game Player, and it's coming out November

02:18:54.040 --> 02:18:54.600
13th.

02:18:54.600 --> 02:18:57.160
It's going to cost $59.99.

02:18:57.160 --> 02:19:01.080
That's 60 bucks for a Genesis, but it has 80 games built in.

02:19:01.080 --> 02:19:02.440
That was fakely like a nomad.

02:19:03.320 --> 02:19:06.040
37 of them are going to be from Sega.

02:19:06.040 --> 02:19:06.600
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:19:06.600 --> 02:19:07.080
It is not.

02:19:07.080 --> 02:19:09.320
It's this one that you plug into your TV.

02:19:09.320 --> 02:19:11.000
No, it looks like a portable system, doesn't it?

02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:11.720
Might be both.

02:19:11.720 --> 02:19:12.680
It could be both.

02:19:13.400 --> 02:19:14.760
Do it with the nomad.

02:19:15.640 --> 02:19:15.880
Yeah.

02:19:15.880 --> 02:19:17.080
I'm trying to see real quick at that.

02:19:18.040 --> 02:19:18.600
I'm not sure.

02:19:18.600 --> 02:19:25.080
Anyway, there's 37 of these games from Sega, three from Capcom, and 40 from assortment

02:19:25.080 --> 02:19:26.440
of other publishers.

02:19:26.440 --> 02:19:27.240
Here's the thing.

02:19:27.240 --> 02:19:32.600
One of those Capcom games that's going to be on this player, Mega Man, the Wily Wars.

02:19:33.560 --> 02:19:39.080
Now, if you don't know what this game is, it's remakes of the first three Mega Mans

02:19:39.080 --> 02:19:44.360
on the NES, along with a game called Wily Tower, like a little mini game.

02:19:44.920 --> 02:19:47.160
It only ever actually came out in Japan and Europe.

02:19:47.720 --> 02:19:54.040
It was on the Sega channel in the US, but how many people actually had the Sega channel?

02:19:54.040 --> 02:19:57.160
So most people missed this when it was first out.

02:19:57.160 --> 02:20:01.400
So it's very interesting that all these years later, the Wily Wars is actually going to

02:20:01.400 --> 02:20:01.720
be out.

02:20:01.720 --> 02:20:05.960
Now, I'm sure half of you out there have already emulated this at this point, but it's

02:20:05.960 --> 02:20:10.760
still worth saying that this is on its way out and who knows what else, what other goodies

02:20:10.760 --> 02:20:11.320
could be in there.

02:20:11.320 --> 02:20:13.960
The only way we know about this one is it's on the box.

02:20:13.960 --> 02:20:15.400
So who knows what else is in there?

02:20:15.400 --> 02:20:17.480
That's pretty awesome.

02:20:18.040 --> 02:20:19.880
That really is, honestly.

02:20:19.880 --> 02:20:20.760
I mean, I've played it.

02:20:20.760 --> 02:20:21.160
It's fun.

02:20:21.720 --> 02:20:22.120
Yeah.

02:20:22.120 --> 02:20:24.760
I remember the first three games are great.

02:20:24.760 --> 02:20:29.720
Now, granted, there was also that PlayStation 2 GameCube collection that was also the...

02:20:29.720 --> 02:20:32.680
And wasn't that the Wily Wars versions of the game?

02:20:32.680 --> 02:20:33.640
Correct me if I'm wrong.

02:20:33.640 --> 02:20:34.680
It's been a long time.

02:20:36.920 --> 02:20:39.400
It's a 2.8 inch LCD screen.

02:20:39.400 --> 02:20:40.840
It's a handheld player.

02:20:40.840 --> 02:20:45.080
Rechargeable battery built in, USB cable included for charging battery.

02:20:45.080 --> 02:20:46.600
Doesn't look like you can hook it up to the TV.

02:20:46.600 --> 02:20:48.440
I still recommend Power Battle.

02:20:50.440 --> 02:20:51.080
You never know.

02:20:53.320 --> 02:20:53.960
All right.

02:20:53.960 --> 02:20:54.600
So there you go.

02:20:55.720 --> 02:20:57.960
Something new all these years later in the US.

02:20:58.600 --> 02:20:59.800
Let's go to the email bag.

02:20:59.800 --> 02:21:04.040
Every week we collect your emails at mailbag at orangelawntrader.com.

02:21:04.040 --> 02:21:05.000
All one of them.

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:05.640
All one of them.

02:21:05.640 --> 02:21:08.440
The Darkstalker is going to dive into the email bag and say,

02:21:08.440 --> 02:21:09.160
Hello.

02:21:09.160 --> 02:21:09.560
Hello.

02:21:10.120 --> 02:21:11.240
And then she'll look on the ground.

02:21:11.240 --> 02:21:13.480
Oh, one lone little email in here.

02:21:13.480 --> 02:21:15.400
It got stuck to my toes.

02:21:15.400 --> 02:21:17.560
Let me just reach down here and pick it up.

02:21:18.520 --> 02:21:21.880
And she'll read that one email on the air here tonight.

02:21:21.880 --> 02:21:22.680
And here it is.

02:21:23.640 --> 02:21:28.680
I see that the stores have Wreck-It Ralph toys, but only three characters in the first wave.

02:21:28.680 --> 02:21:33.320
Ralph Fix-It Felix Jr. and Ralph in the Hero's Duty armor.

02:21:34.120 --> 02:21:34.520
Duty.

02:21:35.240 --> 02:21:39.080
I understand why they can't flood the shelves of Bowser's, Clyde's and Cubert's.

02:21:39.720 --> 02:21:41.480
Who even holds that license now?

02:21:41.480 --> 02:21:45.080
I know a New York holding company licenses the Gotlight Pinball Tables.

02:21:45.080 --> 02:21:47.320
But what about the arcade cabinet games?

02:21:47.320 --> 02:21:51.480
But right now more of the movie's original characters seem to be Disney Store only.

02:21:52.120 --> 02:21:56.440
And just to ask Loki, seriously this time, you mentioned suffering from weekend headaches.

02:21:57.160 --> 02:21:59.160
This is something affecting me as well.

02:21:59.160 --> 02:22:00.920
So what does your doctor think is causing it?

02:22:00.920 --> 02:22:02.040
Allergies or stress maybe?

02:22:02.840 --> 02:22:04.040
No, it'll go my doctor.

02:22:05.880 --> 02:22:08.360
I think it's honestly, it's a combination of a bunch of things.

02:22:08.360 --> 02:22:13.960
I think it's, it may be the fact that I wake up like every hour, a couple hours at night.

02:22:13.960 --> 02:22:18.200
And it could be my pillow is just really uncomfortable sometimes or, you know.

02:22:18.520 --> 02:22:21.000
Um, I should show you the pillow that I use.

02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:22.200
It got rid of most of my headaches.

02:22:22.760 --> 02:22:26.600
Loki also gets a lot of stress caused by this show because he

02:22:26.600 --> 02:22:29.240
pops blood vessels every time a Nintendo story comes up.

02:22:29.240 --> 02:22:29.880
Let's be real.

02:22:29.880 --> 02:22:31.240
I've seen that eye twitch.

02:22:32.280 --> 02:22:33.400
That comes from Robert M.

02:22:34.040 --> 02:22:37.480
Um, the first part of the thing about the licensed toys.

02:22:37.480 --> 02:22:41.080
Um, I think honestly that just would have cost Disney extra money.

02:22:41.080 --> 02:22:45.960
Disney doesn't want to push other people's properties.

02:22:45.960 --> 02:22:48.040
They want to push their own properties.

02:22:48.040 --> 02:22:51.080
And remember, and I don't know if you've actually seen the movie yet or what have you,

02:22:51.080 --> 02:22:55.640
but remember the movie just uses all these licensed stuff to

02:22:56.200 --> 02:23:00.840
kind of get you into the plot that involves characters that are not based off of real games.

02:23:00.840 --> 02:23:03.720
So of course Disney wants to build their own characters.

02:23:04.280 --> 02:23:07.960
So, you know, I think, I think that's what it really boils down to.

02:23:08.600 --> 02:23:13.320
So, but I think you're right about it does seem like a lot of the characters they did use again

02:23:13.320 --> 02:23:18.520
were, and a lot of the references were not necessarily the most popular games.

02:23:18.520 --> 02:23:22.200
I mean, they're, they're recognizable games that doesn't make them the most popular.

02:23:22.200 --> 02:23:24.200
For example, Dark Soccer already mentioned earlier in the show,

02:23:24.200 --> 02:23:26.520
there's a reference to roadblasters in the movie.

02:23:26.520 --> 02:23:32.440
I think everybody recognizes roadblasters, but did roadblasters really have that same

02:23:33.320 --> 02:23:36.440
financial impact and did it make that same kind of money

02:23:36.440 --> 02:23:40.280
that maybe other comparable racing games did like pole position per se?

02:23:40.920 --> 02:23:44.280
Probably not. Or Iron Man, Off-Road, Stewart, that whole thing.

02:23:44.280 --> 02:23:46.280
Probably not. But everybody recognizes it.

02:23:46.280 --> 02:23:49.560
So I think there were just some really smart choices in what was used.

02:23:49.560 --> 02:23:52.520
And because I'm sure somebody is going to mention it if I don't,

02:23:52.520 --> 02:23:54.760
there's even a DDR reference in the very beginning.

02:23:55.800 --> 02:23:59.000
Nobody's really playing DDR or anything. It's just the DDR.

02:23:59.000 --> 02:24:02.280
Uni is the one that calls out and it's in one of the trailers.

02:24:02.280 --> 02:24:06.200
Uni is the one that kind of calls out the arcades closed, you know, that type of thing.

02:24:06.200 --> 02:24:12.120
So, you know, and again, I doubt Uni cost an arm and a leg to license.

02:24:12.120 --> 02:24:15.240
I think there is an actual DDR machine in the movie.

02:24:15.240 --> 02:24:15.640
It is.

02:24:15.640 --> 02:24:16.200
Yeah, there is.

02:24:16.200 --> 02:24:17.960
There's an X2 machine, if I remember correctly.

02:24:17.960 --> 02:24:18.760
Right at the start.

02:24:18.760 --> 02:24:21.160
They licensed the likeness from Konami, I'm sure.

02:24:21.160 --> 02:24:24.120
But that probably cost them a hell of a lot less than

02:24:24.120 --> 02:24:26.600
licensing Simon Belmont would have cost, you know?

02:24:27.160 --> 02:24:29.800
So they're smart.

02:24:29.800 --> 02:24:35.960
Uh, Robert M in chat says, and technically, yes, but what I was saying was

02:24:35.960 --> 02:24:40.280
hope and hopefully vanilla girl and Sergeant Calhoun will be later characters.

02:24:40.280 --> 02:24:41.000
Oh, well, yes.

02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:43.080
I, I hope, I hope they are too.

02:24:43.080 --> 02:24:44.200
Vanellope Von Schweetz.

02:24:44.200 --> 02:24:45.160
Is that what you're talking about?

02:24:46.360 --> 02:24:47.000
You know what?

02:24:47.560 --> 02:24:50.840
She also made me think of Penelope Pitstop because the name was similar.

02:24:51.640 --> 02:24:54.920
Even if Sarah Silverman annoys the shit out of you,

02:24:54.920 --> 02:24:56.920
which I know she's a very controversial comedian.

02:24:56.920 --> 02:24:59.720
I think she's hilarious, but I, I understand that she really

02:24:59.720 --> 02:25:01.720
is like nails on a chalkboard to some people.

02:25:01.720 --> 02:25:03.800
She does a really good job voicing that character.

02:25:03.800 --> 02:25:06.600
She, she was a really good pick for that character because

02:25:06.600 --> 02:25:09.720
that character is supposed to be a little bit nails on chalkboard,

02:25:10.520 --> 02:25:12.600
but I thought that was a really good pick.

02:25:12.600 --> 02:25:15.640
In fact, all the voice actors were really good.

02:25:16.200 --> 02:25:19.880
Jane Lynch, especially was a great choice for that character.

02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:21.320
She was perfect.

02:25:21.320 --> 02:25:21.560
Yeah.

02:25:21.560 --> 02:25:25.000
And, and, uh, the, the 30 Rock guy as Fix-It Felix.

02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:26.920
I mean, this is, they were all very great, great picks.

02:25:28.200 --> 02:25:28.760
All right.

02:25:28.760 --> 02:25:31.960
Uh, since that's it for the emails, shame, shame.

02:25:31.960 --> 02:25:33.720
Mailbag at orange lounge, radio.com.

02:25:33.720 --> 02:25:35.880
Send us more emails to read next week.

02:25:35.880 --> 02:25:38.680
In the meantime, and don't tell us about, you know,

02:25:38.680 --> 02:25:41.000
inheriting money from some guy in England.

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:41.400
Yes.

02:25:41.400 --> 02:25:45.800
Or your, you know, pyramid scheme or the French spam has to stop.

02:25:46.920 --> 02:25:47.880
And the French spam.

02:25:49.160 --> 02:25:49.960
All right.

02:25:49.960 --> 02:25:51.720
Viva la French spam.

02:25:52.120 --> 02:25:52.120


02:25:53.000 --> 02:25:53.560
All right.

02:25:53.560 --> 02:25:56.520
Speaking of things that make us angsty, like French spam,

02:25:57.320 --> 02:26:04.120
it's time for the FUs of the week.

02:26:14.600 --> 02:26:19.080
My FUs are, first of all, to the end of my sinus infection,

02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:22.360
to, uh, origin.

02:26:22.360 --> 02:26:27.080
Well, actually specifically the patch for mass effect three and EA's customer

02:26:27.080 --> 02:26:32.760
service was keeping me from being able to play my game without restriction and

02:26:32.760 --> 02:26:36.120
all of it, but really I can't play it at all.

02:26:37.080 --> 02:26:44.280
Um, and, uh, I had another one, but I'm distracted by raccoon penis.

02:26:44.280 --> 02:26:55.480
Um, I guess just F you to, um, I'll F you to this whole week because we're

02:26:55.480 --> 02:26:58.440
in the whole crux of like the fourth quarter stuff.

02:26:58.440 --> 02:27:07.240
And fortunately in the position of distribution, um, see distribution

02:27:07.240 --> 02:27:12.520
right now, it seems like they don't get call of duty black ops too early enough.

02:27:12.520 --> 02:27:17.400
So the independent stores get theirs for midnight launch, which pisses off

02:27:17.400 --> 02:27:21.240
everybody and keeps having those people ask, how am I supposed to stay in

02:27:21.240 --> 02:27:23.320
business and compete against games?

02:27:23.320 --> 02:27:25.400
It's like, listen, I'm not your fucking person.

02:27:25.400 --> 02:27:27.720
That's supposed to tell you that if I told you that that'd be running your

02:27:27.720 --> 02:27:28.040
store.

02:27:28.760 --> 02:27:30.040
I'm not running your store.

02:27:30.040 --> 02:27:32.200
I don't get paid enough to run your store.

02:27:32.200 --> 02:27:36.680
You don't go up to, you know, you'll own a restaurant and go to your butcher

02:27:36.680 --> 02:27:37.400
wherever you go out.

02:27:37.400 --> 02:27:40.680
Why can't I compete with these other restaurant chains?

02:27:40.680 --> 02:27:41.640
You know, it doesn't make any sense.

02:27:42.280 --> 02:27:43.080
So it's annoying.

02:27:43.080 --> 02:27:47.000
And on top of all that, the rest of my coworkers, sales staff gets to go to

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:49.080
Napa for fun three day weekend.

02:27:50.200 --> 02:27:58.440
But because I landlocked the wife, I do not get to go to Napa.

02:27:58.440 --> 02:28:00.680
Not that I was enjoying that because it's all wine tasting.

02:28:00.680 --> 02:28:02.200
I fucking hate wine.

02:28:02.200 --> 02:28:03.320
So I like wine.

02:28:03.320 --> 02:28:04.360
No, I don't like wine.

02:28:04.360 --> 02:28:06.200
See, I was excited about it cause I was like, sweet.

02:28:06.200 --> 02:28:08.520
Second day is usually kind of that whole fun.

02:28:08.520 --> 02:28:10.360
You get to go do whatever you want.

02:28:10.360 --> 02:28:13.640
Well, they have like activities planned out, but now they only have one activity

02:28:13.640 --> 02:28:14.840
and it's wine tasting.

02:28:14.840 --> 02:28:16.920
See, my activity would be fuck all the activities.

02:28:16.920 --> 02:28:20.920
I'm driving to Menlo Park and I'm going to go to fucking Cuzar.

02:28:22.120 --> 02:28:24.440
But, uh, no, that's not gonna happen.

02:28:24.440 --> 02:28:25.080
So it's fine.

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:28.840
Um, I don't know.

02:28:28.840 --> 02:28:32.440
I have general angst this week, but not things I can really put into words.

02:28:32.440 --> 02:28:33.640
Just stuff and things.

02:28:33.640 --> 02:28:37.240
So F you to stuff things.

02:28:38.200 --> 02:28:39.000
That's all you get.

02:28:40.520 --> 02:28:41.080
All right.

02:28:41.080 --> 02:28:45.640
Uh, let's move on to a few more quick news stories and then we're going to get to your

02:28:45.640 --> 02:28:50.840
calls at 1-877-GAMO-LR and Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:28:50.840 --> 02:28:52.360
But first, two more stories for you.

02:28:52.360 --> 02:28:52.840
Loki.

02:28:52.840 --> 02:28:57.480
Well, we talked last week about some closures regarding, uh, Zynga and some of their Zynga

02:28:57.480 --> 02:28:59.480
properties kind of going buh-bye.

02:28:59.480 --> 02:29:07.080
So the first of those properties to be kind of going away, which goes to show how much

02:29:07.080 --> 02:29:10.920
of this I'm actually, um, interested in, which is none of it.

02:29:10.920 --> 02:29:12.040
Um, Fishville.

02:29:13.240 --> 02:29:15.720
I mean, seriously, this whole Ville thing's got to stop.

02:29:15.720 --> 02:29:21.400
I mean, it looks, it just sounds stupid, but Fishville and Treasure Isle are the first

02:29:21.400 --> 02:29:25.240
two games, um, that will be kind of going by.

02:29:25.240 --> 02:29:30.280
And, uh, this, they're going to stop running, um, on December 5th.

02:29:30.920 --> 02:29:37.240
And I guess Fishville is a game where people fish.

02:29:37.240 --> 02:29:38.840
I don't really, or are fish.

02:29:38.840 --> 02:29:40.040
Imagine that.

02:29:40.040 --> 02:29:40.440
I don't know.

02:29:40.440 --> 02:29:44.120
It's, it's, I don't care.

02:29:44.120 --> 02:29:45.480
Yeah, I really don't.

02:29:45.480 --> 02:29:47.240
Um, yeah.

02:29:48.360 --> 02:29:54.760
But they do refer to their players as Fishville-ers as, uh, this email from the Fishville team.

02:29:55.560 --> 02:29:56.060
Yeah.

02:29:56.680 --> 02:29:57.180
Hmm.

02:29:57.820 --> 02:29:59.100
All right.

02:29:59.100 --> 02:30:00.540
One more story for you guys.

02:30:00.540 --> 02:30:03.580
Here's one for the classic OLR fans.

02:30:03.580 --> 02:30:06.860
Uh, DDR Classroom Edition.

02:30:06.860 --> 02:30:09.740
There's some extra information coming out about DDR Classroom Edition.

02:30:09.740 --> 02:30:09.980
That's right.

02:30:09.980 --> 02:30:15.340
That's kind of where DDR lives on now is in PE programs in schools, which I think is great.

02:30:15.340 --> 02:30:18.780
You know, it's a great way to get kids involved in Dance Dance Revolution.

02:30:18.780 --> 02:30:21.020
Here's the interesting thing about DDR Classroom Edition.

02:30:21.020 --> 02:30:23.660
It's probably better than any other version of the game.

02:30:23.660 --> 02:30:30.220
300 songs in the song list, including like some weird songs.

02:30:30.220 --> 02:30:34.460
Songs have never been in DDR from like Walk It Out.

02:30:34.460 --> 02:30:36.220
You know Konami did that game Walk It Out.

02:30:36.220 --> 02:30:38.540
There's some songs from Walk It Out that are going to be in the game.

02:30:39.180 --> 02:30:41.900
New tracks from 0039.com.

02:30:41.900 --> 02:30:46.540
New dance mania licenses and several licenses from Sony Music Entertainment.

02:30:46.540 --> 02:30:47.040
What?

02:30:48.700 --> 02:30:52.380
Apparently going to get new music updates every three to six months.

02:30:52.380 --> 02:30:56.700
After some successful location tests in Southern California and some schools there.

02:30:57.580 --> 02:30:59.660
They're being very aggressive about the title.

02:30:59.660 --> 02:31:07.980
Too bad it's something for schools and not for people to like actually get.

02:31:07.980 --> 02:31:11.900
Well, here's the thing though is I think a lot of this stuff that they're probably licensing

02:31:11.900 --> 02:31:16.460
for the Dance, uh, the Classroom Edition is probably going to end up in Dance Dance Revolution.

02:31:16.460 --> 02:31:19.500
The fourth or fifth reboot of the franchise.

02:31:19.500 --> 02:31:20.700
Oh, the new one coming out.

02:31:20.700 --> 02:31:23.340
I think that'd be my guess because they're doing too many licenses.

02:31:23.340 --> 02:31:26.780
I doubt they would dump that much money into a Classroom Edition,

02:31:26.780 --> 02:31:28.940
which really doesn't need a diverse.

02:31:29.740 --> 02:31:35.900
I mean, if you think about it, do you really need a diverse soundtrack for the Classroom Edition?

02:31:36.780 --> 02:31:39.820
I mean, most, I'm assuming most of the stuff is going to be picked by the,

02:31:40.380 --> 02:31:43.500
you know, the teacher in the class and no one's going to go,

02:31:43.500 --> 02:31:49.100
Oh my goodness, I really want to hear that song by the Screaming Masks or

02:31:50.940 --> 02:31:51.740
Trailers.

02:31:51.740 --> 02:31:54.300
There's a pink song, So What?

02:31:54.300 --> 02:31:55.660
I've heard that song on the radio.

02:31:56.460 --> 02:31:58.540
Natasha Bedingfield, Pocket Full of Sunshine,

02:31:58.540 --> 02:32:03.020
although I think wasn't that in the DDR release on the most recent PlayStation?

02:32:03.020 --> 02:32:03.500
I don't know.

02:32:05.820 --> 02:32:10.060
Chris Brown's song, you know, because they really should encourage his stuff in schools.

02:32:10.700 --> 02:32:14.220
Uh, yeah, that's a huge song list though.

02:32:14.220 --> 02:32:16.220
397 songs looking at the PDF.

02:32:16.220 --> 02:32:17.660
But the question is-

02:32:17.660 --> 02:32:18.860
I'm sure it ain't cheap.

02:32:19.500 --> 02:32:24.860
Question is, and you know, thankfully they have this totally not sorted by artists.

02:32:25.900 --> 02:32:26.780
Is Holic in the game?

02:32:28.700 --> 02:32:29.980
Is Holic in there?

02:32:29.980 --> 02:32:30.940
Holic is not in there.

02:32:30.940 --> 02:32:31.980
At least I didn't see it.

02:32:31.980 --> 02:32:33.260
Maybe future DLC.

02:32:33.980 --> 02:32:35.020
Hot Limit though is.

02:32:36.460 --> 02:32:36.960
Awesome.

02:32:37.980 --> 02:32:39.340
You say Dramamine.

02:32:39.900 --> 02:32:41.820
All right, uh, let's go to the phones.

02:32:41.820 --> 02:32:45.980
1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:32:45.980 --> 02:32:47.820
The phones are now open.

02:32:48.860 --> 02:32:50.060
You can give us a call.

02:32:50.060 --> 02:32:54.620
I'm gonna go to the Twitter topics, but I gotta grab my iPad.

02:32:54.620 --> 02:32:57.260
Loki, do you have any last minute stories?

02:32:57.900 --> 02:32:59.500
No, I was just checking out-

02:32:59.500 --> 02:33:00.000
Shit.

02:33:01.660 --> 02:33:02.460
Stop it.

02:33:02.460 --> 02:33:04.620
I was just checking out some of the songs that are in here.

02:33:04.620 --> 02:33:06.700
I was just, you know, seeing what they've got here and-

02:33:08.140 --> 02:33:09.260
I'm sorry, I was asleep.

02:33:10.140 --> 02:33:14.540
They've got, um, they really don't have this in any sort of order.

02:33:15.180 --> 02:33:18.300
But, uh, I'm trying to see if Holic is in here.

02:33:18.300 --> 02:33:19.980
Holic is the best song ever.

02:33:19.980 --> 02:33:21.420
They have, uh, Silent Hill.

02:33:21.420 --> 02:33:23.180
Thomas Howard, you know, for Christmas.

02:33:23.180 --> 02:33:23.900
So that's kind of cool.

02:33:24.540 --> 02:33:25.040
Um.

02:33:26.380 --> 02:33:28.620
Is that what happens in school now during the winter?

02:33:28.620 --> 02:33:30.460
Is like DDR time?

02:33:30.460 --> 02:33:33.100
You know, I think it'd be fucking awesome.

02:33:33.820 --> 02:33:35.660
It would be really awesome to have that.

02:33:35.660 --> 02:33:39.500
Because it was what Ultimate, like, it was like dodgeball or something like that.

02:33:40.220 --> 02:33:41.420
What the hell did we used to do?

02:33:41.420 --> 02:33:42.700
Play basketball maybe?

02:33:42.700 --> 02:33:43.660
We used to do square dancing.

02:33:43.660 --> 02:33:44.540
Yeah, we used to do square dancing.

02:33:44.540 --> 02:33:45.660
Square dancing was the best.

02:33:47.340 --> 02:33:47.900
You're weird.

02:33:48.780 --> 02:33:51.500
I, it was the one thing I was good at.

02:33:53.100 --> 02:33:54.220
Grab your partner.

02:33:54.220 --> 02:33:55.260
That and pickleball.

02:33:55.260 --> 02:33:56.540
Did you guys ever play pickleball?

02:33:56.540 --> 02:33:57.180
No.

02:33:57.180 --> 02:33:58.140
That was the other thing.

02:33:58.140 --> 02:34:01.580
It was like, it was like tennis, but kind of like dumbed down a little bit.

02:34:01.580 --> 02:34:05.180
We had, we had a game that we would play that was called Sink the Bismarck.

02:34:05.820 --> 02:34:06.320
What?

02:34:06.940 --> 02:34:09.020
After the ship from the World War.

02:34:09.580 --> 02:34:16.380
But, um, but basically it was a, but you had two sides and you had a few students in the,

02:34:16.380 --> 02:34:19.580
um, middle and they were the land, they were the water mines.

02:34:20.220 --> 02:34:23.260
And so the students were all the ships crossing the ocean.

02:34:23.980 --> 02:34:28.620
And if one of the land mines managed to touch, or not land mines, but the water mines

02:34:28.620 --> 02:34:31.580
managed to touch one of the other students, then they became a mine and they had to stop

02:34:31.580 --> 02:34:32.540
where they were.

02:34:32.540 --> 02:34:34.860
And until the last one left was the winner.

02:34:35.660 --> 02:34:36.160
So.

02:34:39.900 --> 02:34:42.060
I just remember every Friday we had to run the mile.

02:34:43.020 --> 02:34:49.420
Uh, let's see, going to Twitter topics at, uh, twitter.com slash O L R.

02:34:49.420 --> 02:34:54.300
Um, thankfully there's no, let them move as to share 100.

02:34:54.300 --> 02:34:55.340
Matt linked us this story.

02:34:55.340 --> 02:34:59.500
I thought this was in our show role, but I think it just might've made not made this,

02:34:59.500 --> 02:35:00.860
uh, this week.

02:35:00.860 --> 02:35:01.500
I don't know.

02:35:01.500 --> 02:35:04.220
Take two is going to be opening a new Las Vegas office.

02:35:04.220 --> 02:35:04.460
Yeah.

02:35:04.460 --> 02:35:06.780
You know, it was one of the stories you posted that we just didn't get to tonight.

02:35:06.780 --> 02:35:11.100
Cause you, you talked to grand theft auto somewhere else, but, uh, yeah, 150 jobs in

02:35:11.100 --> 02:35:16.140
Las Vegas, a brand new downtown office, Las Vegas region development agency is offering

02:35:16.140 --> 02:35:18.540
up $600,000 in incentives to take two.

02:35:18.540 --> 02:35:24.540
If they open the branch, I'm telling you, man, Vegas is a pretty awesome cause everyone

02:35:24.540 --> 02:35:27.660
really thinks of Vegas is kind of like, Ooh, casinos and stuff like that.

02:35:27.660 --> 02:35:31.340
But it's actually a pretty cool suburb with like really cheap housing.

02:35:31.980 --> 02:35:32.860
And it's not bad.

02:35:32.860 --> 02:35:36.940
If like you're not into the whole casino thing, it's still like a nice suburb.

02:35:36.940 --> 02:35:40.300
I'm not sure if everybody who lives there would agree with you, but let's go to the

02:35:40.540 --> 02:35:40.860
scene.

02:35:40.860 --> 02:35:41.820
Like a nice suburb.

02:35:41.820 --> 02:35:42.220
I don't know.

02:35:42.220 --> 02:35:42.940
Hi, you're on orange.

02:35:42.940 --> 02:35:43.500
Don's radio.

02:35:43.500 --> 02:35:43.900
Who's this?

02:35:44.620 --> 02:35:46.460
Uh, a survivor of the hurricane.

02:35:46.460 --> 02:35:47.020
Ranma.

02:35:47.020 --> 02:35:48.300
Hey, so you came out.

02:35:48.300 --> 02:35:48.700
Okay.

02:35:48.700 --> 02:35:48.940
Huh?

02:35:49.500 --> 02:35:49.740
Yeah.

02:35:49.740 --> 02:35:50.380
Pretty much.

02:35:50.380 --> 02:35:54.700
Um, one of our studios, AKA Joe big day, uh, she lost power for a few days, but other

02:35:54.700 --> 02:35:56.380
than that came out pretty good.

02:35:56.380 --> 02:35:59.980
Well, you know, a lot worse things could happen than losing power for a few days.

02:35:59.980 --> 02:36:05.980
I'm, I'm glad to hear places are recovering, you know, it's, it's, it's really tragic

02:36:05.980 --> 02:36:09.500
seeing a lot of the stuff that's happening along the New Jersey shore and all that.

02:36:09.500 --> 02:36:15.740
Like all the jokes about reality TV aside, like seeing that roller coaster just submerged

02:36:15.740 --> 02:36:20.780
in water is just like, like jaw on floor type of thing.

02:36:20.780 --> 02:36:23.100
It's just, it's, it's, it's upsetting.

02:36:23.100 --> 02:36:29.660
But, um, you know, I know the photos of the train station is right by my house in the

02:36:29.660 --> 02:36:31.900
one few little bit down the way.

02:36:31.900 --> 02:36:33.660
So, you know, water had me spazzing.

02:36:33.660 --> 02:36:38.620
And then like on Wednesday when he started saying, you can take trains, you can take

02:36:38.700 --> 02:36:39.580
some of the buses.

02:36:39.580 --> 02:36:43.580
Me and a couple of friends went down to Coney Island to survey some of the damage.

02:36:43.580 --> 02:36:44.460
I saw the pictures.

02:36:44.460 --> 02:36:47.420
It didn't seem like it was that bad.

02:36:48.540 --> 02:36:50.700
Truth is it really wasn't.

02:36:50.700 --> 02:36:52.380
It was just mostly water.

02:36:52.380 --> 02:36:55.180
The beach itself was just, just wrecked.

02:36:55.180 --> 02:37:00.620
Um, I did shoot video and one of the people I had spoken with, he said the main thing,

02:37:00.620 --> 02:37:06.940
reason why most of Coney Island came out intact is because the, where the hurricane was coming

02:37:06.940 --> 02:37:09.420
it wasn't coming in from the, from where the beach is.

02:37:09.420 --> 02:37:11.100
It was coming in from...

02:37:11.100 --> 02:37:13.900
It was coming up through land, wasn't it?

02:37:14.540 --> 02:37:15.180
Say what?

02:37:15.180 --> 02:37:16.460
Wasn't it coming up through land?

02:37:17.180 --> 02:37:17.900
Yeah, pretty much.

02:37:17.900 --> 02:37:18.140
Yeah.

02:37:18.140 --> 02:37:23.740
So all the shops along Coney Island, like before you hit the beach, they took the brunt

02:37:23.740 --> 02:37:24.460
end of everything.

02:37:24.460 --> 02:37:26.780
By the time it got up, there was just really just a mass of wind.

02:37:27.820 --> 02:37:28.780
Yeah, pretty much.

02:37:28.780 --> 02:37:32.380
And now they're talking about another storm coming our way in about two days.

02:37:32.380 --> 02:37:33.660
Oh, goodie.

02:37:33.740 --> 02:37:36.940
Well, this is why you're supposed to fill your bathtub with water, have bleach, get

02:37:36.940 --> 02:37:38.140
canned food, buy all the bread.

02:37:38.860 --> 02:37:39.660
Tape your windows.

02:37:41.180 --> 02:37:45.340
I did all of that and we had a big ol', a big ol' bucket of hurricane to drink.

02:37:47.420 --> 02:37:51.020
But, but I, but I will tell you, welcome to my childhood.

02:37:51.020 --> 02:37:54.060
Rama, I'm sure you didn't just call in to talk about the storm, but thank you for the

02:37:54.060 --> 02:37:54.860
update.

02:37:54.860 --> 02:37:55.820
What's on your mind tonight?

02:37:56.380 --> 02:38:03.820
Um, my issues with Xbox and banning people for names and insults and stuff.

02:38:03.820 --> 02:38:07.020
I mean, I kind of see both points on this.

02:38:07.020 --> 02:38:12.460
It just feels like this is no different from being in high school and you're being bullied

02:38:12.460 --> 02:38:16.940
and you're hearing N word, F word, K, all this, all this stuff.

02:38:16.940 --> 02:38:25.020
And it's like, if you run your, if you go, go report it, this happens, that happens.

02:38:25.020 --> 02:38:30.780
In a way, I kind of feel like, you know, just let them handle, let them handle their own

02:38:30.780 --> 02:38:31.820
business, you know?

02:38:32.460 --> 02:38:37.100
But on the same token, if it's just a bunch of friends running their mouth, having a good

02:38:37.100 --> 02:38:41.180
time, you got that one person coming in, starting to freak out and then all hell breaks loose.

02:38:41.180 --> 02:38:41.340
Yeah.

02:38:41.340 --> 02:38:44.380
But if you're going to play with your friends, why would you let that one person in anyway?

02:38:45.100 --> 02:38:48.860
Because you know, it's always in that, in the group is like, you always bring that one

02:38:48.860 --> 02:38:50.300
person and like, Oh, don't worry.

02:38:50.300 --> 02:38:50.940
He's cool.

02:38:50.940 --> 02:38:51.500
He's understanding.

02:38:51.500 --> 02:38:52.380
Oh, she's cool.

02:38:52.380 --> 02:38:53.420
She's understandable.

02:38:53.420 --> 02:38:56.220
And then you're like, and you find a little, Oh shit.

02:38:56.220 --> 02:39:00.540
Or back in the day when we do PSO and only three of us were online and we wanted a fourth

02:39:00.540 --> 02:39:05.660
to do, uh, the full challenge, we would, uh, just go to open lobby, the three of us and

02:39:05.660 --> 02:39:06.860
pull another person.

02:39:06.860 --> 02:39:07.100
Yeah.

02:39:07.100 --> 02:39:11.340
You can kind of, um, also one thing to remember about the Xbox 360, cause we've done this

02:39:11.340 --> 02:39:16.140
with Mass Effect 3 a lot is that you can go into party mode and you can chat in the little

02:39:16.140 --> 02:39:21.260
party chat that's on your crossbar or whoops, that's the Sony thing, whatever they call

02:39:21.420 --> 02:39:24.620
the, you know, the main interface on Xbox dashboard, it's on your dashboard.

02:39:24.620 --> 02:39:27.980
So like, you know, like Shane and I might be playing Mass Effect and maybe we have,

02:39:27.980 --> 02:39:30.540
you know, acidic vampire, Oscar, somebody with us.

02:39:30.540 --> 02:39:34.700
It's like the three of us will be in the party chat and then we'll bring in a random fourth,

02:39:34.700 --> 02:39:39.180
but they can't hear us because we're in the party chat and that dialogue doesn't go out

02:39:39.180 --> 02:39:39.660
in game.

02:39:39.660 --> 02:39:42.780
So, you know, we have to remember the Xbox does have that infrastructure set up.

02:39:42.780 --> 02:39:46.460
So if you do want to bring in randoms to fill out your party, you know, you can still have

02:39:46.460 --> 02:39:49.660
your closed conversation without worrying about offending some stranger.

02:39:51.500 --> 02:39:52.380
There we go.

02:39:52.380 --> 02:39:52.620
Yeah.

02:39:52.620 --> 02:39:56.300
So that is, that's the solution, but still, I, I still get what you're saying, you know,

02:39:56.300 --> 02:40:01.020
where, you know, you don't want that one per, cause still you could be bringing somebody

02:40:01.020 --> 02:40:07.900
into your little party chat that maybe you kind of didn't estimate correctly and maybe

02:40:07.900 --> 02:40:08.940
we'll take offense.

02:40:08.940 --> 02:40:15.900
But I think, I don't know, I guess Microsoft to some extent maybe has a, has a responsibility

02:40:15.900 --> 02:40:19.820
to not regulate private games the same way they would regulate a public game.

02:40:20.060 --> 02:40:21.260
Well, that works for me.

02:40:21.260 --> 02:40:26.060
Just like if I want to say in the privacy of my own home, I want to say every offensive

02:40:26.060 --> 02:40:28.620
word I can think of and believe me, I know a lot of them.

02:40:28.620 --> 02:40:31.420
If I want to say those in the privacy of my own home where nobody ever hears them, but

02:40:31.420 --> 02:40:33.740
Alan, you know, that's between Alan and I, right?

02:40:34.300 --> 02:40:35.180
Yep.

02:40:35.180 --> 02:40:40.220
Although some would argue it's toxic to use those words in any circumstance, but that's

02:40:40.220 --> 02:40:42.140
a debate for another time, I suppose.

02:40:42.140 --> 02:40:42.940
Yes, definitely.

02:40:44.940 --> 02:40:47.260
So gosh, anything else still on your mind tonight, buddy?

02:40:47.900 --> 02:40:50.780
A friend of mine did a voice in Wreck-It Ralph.

02:40:50.780 --> 02:40:51.580
Oh really?

02:40:51.580 --> 02:40:52.140
What voice?

02:40:52.140 --> 02:40:52.620
Do you know?

02:40:53.340 --> 02:40:54.140
He was Ryu.

02:40:55.180 --> 02:40:56.140
Get out!

02:40:56.140 --> 02:40:57.740
That's awesome.

02:40:58.940 --> 02:41:02.300
It was a quick scene, but it was, it was funny.

02:41:02.300 --> 02:41:03.180
Everybody laughed.

02:41:04.300 --> 02:41:05.180
That's very cool.

02:41:05.180 --> 02:41:08.380
And if everything goes according to plan, I'll be going to see it this week dressed

02:41:08.380 --> 02:41:09.980
as Luigi and I will have pictures.

02:41:09.980 --> 02:41:10.620
There you go.

02:41:10.620 --> 02:41:13.500
Even though sadly, I'm sad to report, Luigi's not in the movie.

02:41:13.500 --> 02:41:14.540
It doesn't matter.

02:41:14.540 --> 02:41:15.500
It doesn't matter.

02:41:15.500 --> 02:41:17.500
Luigi's still number one, super guy.

02:41:20.460 --> 02:41:23.100
Well, we need, so you haven't seen Wreck-It Ralph yet?

02:41:23.100 --> 02:41:23.980
No, I have not.

02:41:23.980 --> 02:41:26.620
Well, we do need the movie to be black Luigi approved.

02:41:26.620 --> 02:41:28.140
So, um, you know.

02:41:28.140 --> 02:41:29.420
So will the Wii U launch.

02:41:31.260 --> 02:41:32.860
We need stories from the Wii U launch.

02:41:32.860 --> 02:41:35.100
I don't, I don't, I don't know what's going on here.

02:41:35.100 --> 02:41:38.620
Like I, everything about this launch is very mysterious to me.

02:41:38.620 --> 02:41:40.860
Like, I don't, like, it seems like it's all done in pre-orders.

02:41:40.860 --> 02:41:42.220
Like, are people even camping out?

02:41:42.220 --> 02:41:43.580
Is that a thing anymore?

02:41:44.060 --> 02:41:45.260
People are camp.

02:41:46.620 --> 02:41:48.300
My younger brother, Greg.

02:41:48.300 --> 02:41:51.980
He, upon hearing about the pre-orders and all of this, he sends me a message.

02:41:52.700 --> 02:41:55.900
You are coming with me to camp out for the Wii U, right?

02:41:56.460 --> 02:41:57.580
I guess.

02:41:57.580 --> 02:41:59.180
You are coming, right?

02:41:59.180 --> 02:41:59.900
Okay.

02:41:59.900 --> 02:42:01.020
I will be there.

02:42:01.020 --> 02:42:02.140
Just save me some soup.

02:42:02.860 --> 02:42:03.980
I don't want to camp out.

02:42:03.980 --> 02:42:06.380
I just want to go on Amazon and have him ship it.

02:42:06.380 --> 02:42:07.580
Like, I'm just lazy.

02:42:08.380 --> 02:42:09.900
I'm too old to camp out.

02:42:10.700 --> 02:42:11.980
You haven't ordered it yet?

02:42:12.780 --> 02:42:13.580
I don't care.

02:42:13.580 --> 02:42:14.460
And I don't want one.

02:42:15.420 --> 02:42:18.380
I'm hoping I have connections that can help me get one.

02:42:18.380 --> 02:42:20.540
Well, I plan on getting one, so.

02:42:20.540 --> 02:42:21.020
There you go.

02:42:21.020 --> 02:42:22.700
Well, you have to let us know how it is.

02:42:22.700 --> 02:42:23.500
Oh, by the way.

02:42:24.140 --> 02:42:26.620
I'm just, I'm buying it so I can just put it on eBay.

02:42:28.540 --> 02:42:30.140
One thing real quick about Wreck-It Ralph.

02:42:31.020 --> 02:42:35.100
The little film at the very beginning of it will give you sniffles.

02:42:35.740 --> 02:42:37.740
It was so paper man.

02:42:37.740 --> 02:42:38.700
The little short.

02:42:38.700 --> 02:42:39.820
Cause that's like a thing now.

02:42:39.820 --> 02:42:43.420
A lot of the Pixar movies and Disney, even Disney classics have these shorts in front of them.

02:42:43.420 --> 02:42:43.900
Yeah, it was really good.

02:42:43.900 --> 02:42:46.380
It was called paper man and it was really sweet.

02:42:46.380 --> 02:42:47.260
It was cute.

02:42:47.260 --> 02:42:48.140
It was cute.

02:42:48.140 --> 02:42:48.460
All right.

02:42:49.100 --> 02:42:52.380
Referring paper man to slender man, but I'll be it from me.

02:42:52.380 --> 02:42:52.620
All right.

02:42:52.620 --> 02:42:54.540
Well, Rama, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls.

02:42:54.540 --> 02:42:55.180
Okay.

02:42:55.180 --> 02:42:55.500
All right.

02:42:55.500 --> 02:42:55.820
Cool.

02:42:55.820 --> 02:42:56.060
All right.

02:42:56.060 --> 02:42:56.860
Bye.

02:42:56.860 --> 02:42:57.360
Bye.

02:42:59.020 --> 02:43:00.460
Always nice to hear from Rama.

02:43:00.460 --> 02:43:04.780
One of the hosts of anime jam session Tuesdays on the voice of geeks network.

02:43:04.780 --> 02:43:08.940
Although I didn't mention this during the show, but some of you probably picked on or I picked

02:43:08.940 --> 02:43:13.580
up on this, our feed was down for like four days this week.

02:43:13.580 --> 02:43:14.700
It was pretty crazy.

02:43:15.260 --> 02:43:18.460
So some of our programming got rolled over to next week.

02:43:18.460 --> 02:43:19.580
Critical myth.

02:43:19.580 --> 02:43:24.940
We'll be back, uh, next week with some of the episodes that got missed due to the outage.

02:43:24.940 --> 02:43:28.940
I think the Warcraft shows, unfortunately, they're just going to have to be missed.

02:43:29.740 --> 02:43:31.260
But anyway, we got another call coming in.

02:43:31.260 --> 02:43:32.220
So let's go to the phones.

02:43:32.220 --> 02:43:33.260
Hi, you're on orange launch radio.

02:43:33.260 --> 02:43:33.660
Who's this?

02:43:34.620 --> 02:43:36.860
Hey guys, it's the one and only degenerate Johnny.

02:43:37.660 --> 02:43:39.020
What is up degenerate Johnny?

02:43:39.020 --> 02:43:41.580
You wrote that comment on Facebook earlier, right?

02:43:41.580 --> 02:43:42.140
Yes, I did.

02:43:42.140 --> 02:43:44.460
I called into follow up on that.

02:43:44.460 --> 02:43:45.020
Please do.

02:43:46.460 --> 02:43:46.780
All right.

02:43:46.780 --> 02:43:55.500
So basically it seems to me that, you know, gaming in the culture that we live today,

02:43:56.140 --> 02:43:59.900
it still hasn't really gotten it through these people's heads.

02:43:59.900 --> 02:44:06.620
I mean, look back a few years back, um, Fox news, you know, I geeked out when Fox news

02:44:06.620 --> 02:44:09.980
was saying, Oh yeah, we're going to have a, we're going to talk about mass effect.

02:44:09.980 --> 02:44:11.580
I'm like, Oh my goodness.

02:44:11.580 --> 02:44:16.380
And it was nothing but a bash fest over that 30 second love scene.

02:44:16.380 --> 02:44:19.020
I'm like, what the hell is this crap?

02:44:19.020 --> 02:44:24.060
Of which, of which there is much worse stuff shown on Fox television.

02:44:25.260 --> 02:44:26.460
Like, exactly.

02:44:26.460 --> 02:44:30.140
You know, I mean, good.

02:44:30.140 --> 02:44:30.860
Oh, that's it.

02:44:30.860 --> 02:44:35.260
Just, I was just saying like glee and house and all those shows have far worse content.

02:44:36.060 --> 02:44:36.380
Right.

02:44:36.380 --> 02:44:36.860
Exactly.

02:44:36.860 --> 02:44:42.460
And even their quote unquote expert, uh, Cooper Lawrence said it herself that she saw, you

02:44:42.460 --> 02:44:48.060
know, sayings and loss that were actually more explicit than that love scene, you know.

02:44:49.980 --> 02:44:57.580
But, you know, it seems, it seems amazing to me that, you know, nothing has evolved

02:44:57.580 --> 02:45:00.700
ever since, you know, 1993.

02:45:00.700 --> 02:45:06.620
This is where I think the gaming industry has evolved from a child's toy was the moment

02:45:06.620 --> 02:45:12.940
that Congress approached the electronic software association after Mortal Kombat and Doom and

02:45:12.940 --> 02:45:14.460
saying, Hey, you know what?

02:45:14.460 --> 02:45:20.300
We appreciate, you know, what you guys are doing, but now your content has more than

02:45:20.300 --> 02:45:21.820
one form of audience.

02:45:21.820 --> 02:45:24.060
You have to separate it.

02:45:24.060 --> 02:45:30.460
And, you know, from that point, I think that was a turning point from us being a child's

02:45:30.460 --> 02:45:36.620
toy or a fad into actually becoming, you know, the next form of entertainment.

02:45:38.380 --> 02:45:41.660
And well, let me, let me, let me throw this out there just to be devil's advocate.

02:45:41.660 --> 02:45:44.540
It's not that I disagree with you, but I want to throw this thought out here and see what

02:45:44.540 --> 02:45:48.620
you think about this because 20 years ago, which, you know, 93 was almost 20 years ago

02:45:48.620 --> 02:45:54.300
at this point, another industry that faced a lot of battles in Congress was the music

02:45:54.300 --> 02:45:55.180
industry.

02:45:55.180 --> 02:45:59.420
And this is because gangster rap started to take a storm a little bit.

02:45:59.420 --> 02:46:03.420
And this is where that whole little black and white sticker that says parental advisory

02:46:03.420 --> 02:46:05.340
caution explicit lyrics came from.

02:46:05.340 --> 02:46:08.300
And a lot of this is perpetuated by the same person between the two.

02:46:08.300 --> 02:46:08.540
Yeah.

02:46:08.540 --> 02:46:09.100
Hilarious.

02:46:09.100 --> 02:46:09.580
Right.

02:46:09.580 --> 02:46:16.620
But, but, but, well, you know, where it came from regardless, you know, music doesn't get

02:46:16.620 --> 02:46:22.860
that same, pardon the pun, rap that video games does and being accepted in mainstream

02:46:22.860 --> 02:46:23.260
culture.

02:46:23.260 --> 02:46:28.060
Although I guess one could argue, there's still a lot of people that say gangster rap's

02:46:28.060 --> 02:46:28.940
not music.

02:46:28.940 --> 02:46:29.740
It's garbage.

02:46:30.860 --> 02:46:34.540
There's people out there that feel that way, whether they're right or wrong.

02:46:34.540 --> 02:46:39.180
So I, you know, it's, it's just interesting to me that, you know, music fought a lot of

02:46:39.180 --> 02:46:40.940
that stuff in the nineties too.

02:46:40.940 --> 02:46:41.260
Yet.

02:46:42.220 --> 02:46:46.700
Oh, I mean, it fought, it fought against that battle, you know, way before then.

02:46:46.700 --> 02:46:50.220
I mean, hell, the Beatles were, were considered the devil's music.

02:46:51.340 --> 02:46:52.700
Play the records backwards.

02:46:52.700 --> 02:46:53.020
Remember?

02:46:54.060 --> 02:46:54.300
Yeah.

02:46:55.740 --> 02:46:59.980
I was like, how am I worshiping the devil when I'm hearing, I want to hold your hand.

02:46:59.980 --> 02:47:00.460
What the hell?

02:47:01.740 --> 02:47:06.460
Because it's you, it's you wanting to hold the devil's hand as you walk through the lakes

02:47:06.460 --> 02:47:08.140
of fire in a fiery hell.

02:47:09.020 --> 02:47:10.700
Oh, dear Lord, Lordy.

02:47:10.700 --> 02:47:11.580
Oh my goodness.

02:47:14.620 --> 02:47:14.940
Yeah.

02:47:14.940 --> 02:47:16.700
It, you know, it just astounds me.

02:47:16.700 --> 02:47:21.420
And, you know, you know, the follow up on, you know, what I also said is that, you know,

02:47:22.220 --> 02:47:29.980
I do agree with you that entertainment today actually requires, you know, you know, technology

02:47:30.940 --> 02:47:31.900
and it has evolved.

02:47:31.900 --> 02:47:34.140
I mean, hell, that is what the saying is.

02:47:34.140 --> 02:47:36.540
Art is alive and it evolves.

02:47:36.540 --> 02:47:43.100
I mean, you know, like I said in chat was, you know, the gladiatorial arts was the entertainment

02:47:43.100 --> 02:47:51.420
for the Roman society and it now has evolved to cage fighting, boxing, if you want storyline,

02:47:51.420 --> 02:47:53.020
pro wrestling, you know.

02:47:53.020 --> 02:47:58.620
And so I've been actually studying up on this and seeing how, you know, all these forms

02:47:58.620 --> 02:48:06.940
of entertainment, obviously still some entertainments, you know, are a little, you know, they cling

02:48:08.540 --> 02:48:11.820
to their old ways, you know, tradition, which I do respect.

02:48:11.820 --> 02:48:17.820
You know, there's obviously plays and playwrights and it, you know, as a matter of fact, you

02:48:17.820 --> 02:48:23.580
know, what you and Jessica Harper recently did with Rocky Horror, you know.

02:48:23.580 --> 02:48:28.460
I mean, that is a, you know, a form of evolution from, you know, the plays and playwrights

02:48:28.460 --> 02:48:30.860
and, you know, it's becoming, you know.

02:48:32.860 --> 02:48:37.500
It's funny you bring that up because that in particular is something that is, I actually

02:48:37.500 --> 02:48:38.780
was at Rocky Horror last night.

02:48:38.780 --> 02:48:42.540
That's why I got home at five in the morning because I was with one of the Bay Area cast

02:48:42.540 --> 02:48:45.340
who was celebrating their 17th birthday as a cast.

02:48:45.340 --> 02:48:47.100
Rocky Horror, I know, right?

02:48:47.100 --> 02:48:51.900
Rocky Horror is something that's been around for 35 years, but it is interesting.

02:48:51.900 --> 02:48:52.860
You talk about it.

02:48:52.860 --> 02:48:54.620
Oh God, I could fill another show with this.

02:48:55.180 --> 02:48:56.780
You just set me on a tangent.

02:48:56.780 --> 02:49:00.860
It is interesting that that whole stuff could be considered another art form because there's

02:49:00.860 --> 02:49:06.060
other movies now that, you know, people want to kind of shadow cast and bring to that.

02:49:06.060 --> 02:49:09.900
And especially with the group I've been working with here in Sacramento, they really have

02:49:09.900 --> 02:49:10.860
made an art out of it.

02:49:10.860 --> 02:49:15.020
I mean, I know I'm talking them up, but you've got to see the way they do repo the genetic

02:49:15.020 --> 02:49:15.820
opera.

02:49:15.820 --> 02:49:19.980
I mean, like that movie for all practical purposes is kind of stupid.

02:49:19.980 --> 02:49:25.500
But when you see the stage show of it, you're like, is this shit for real?

02:49:25.500 --> 02:49:27.260
This is crazy.

02:49:27.260 --> 02:49:30.220
And I mean, words can only came and describe it.

02:49:30.220 --> 02:49:34.140
You know, it is the exactly the atmosphere.

02:49:34.140 --> 02:49:37.500
And now they're talking about doing it for, and I don't know how much I'm supposed to

02:49:37.500 --> 02:49:40.540
stay on my little radio show or not, but now they're talking about doing it for the room.

02:49:40.540 --> 02:49:43.340
And there was talk about doing Scott Pilgrim versus the world at one point.

02:49:43.340 --> 02:49:44.380
They've had to put that on hold.

02:49:44.380 --> 02:49:47.420
I think it's a rights thing, but that was like going to be a thing.

02:49:48.060 --> 02:49:53.020
So, yeah, well, Jessica said something last night on under sedation life that she was

02:49:53.020 --> 02:49:55.580
actually going to be doing something that involves the room.

02:49:55.580 --> 02:50:00.780
Yeah, I, I, I, I have mixed feelings about the room, but anyway, we'll leave that to

02:50:00.780 --> 02:50:01.420
another show.

02:50:02.300 --> 02:50:02.620
All right.

02:50:02.620 --> 02:50:04.780
But let me, let me, let me go back to video games of this.

02:50:04.780 --> 02:50:09.500
I want to ask you about this so, so we can wrap up, um, because you did kind of make

02:50:09.500 --> 02:50:11.100
the comment on Facebook.

02:50:11.180 --> 02:50:19.260
Let me ask you, what would you like to see happen next with the video game movie working

02:50:19.260 --> 02:50:21.180
hand in hand together in this fusion?

02:50:21.180 --> 02:50:23.340
What would you see like to see happen next with that?

02:50:23.340 --> 02:50:26.140
Or do you think we need to stop obsessing about it?

02:50:27.340 --> 02:50:32.940
Honestly, I think we need to stop obsessing for, uh, on it because you know, you look

02:50:32.940 --> 02:50:40.460
at the past, the two industries never really, you know, you know, they never really, you

02:50:40.460 --> 02:50:45.740
know, generate a form of like something that's really successful.

02:50:45.740 --> 02:50:51.340
There's never been a real successful video game that has been based off of movie and

02:50:51.340 --> 02:50:58.380
you have never really seen a movie, a very successful movie, uh, you know, uh, being

02:50:58.380 --> 02:50:59.500
based off of a game.

02:50:59.500 --> 02:51:05.020
I don't see Oscar winning award games and I know we all want to see Mass Effect on the

02:51:05.020 --> 02:51:08.140
big screen and you want to see Warcraft on the big screen.

02:51:09.100 --> 02:51:12.060
But those movies are gonna suck.

02:51:12.060 --> 02:51:16.300
Let's be, if you are a fan of those games, there is no possible way those movies are

02:51:16.300 --> 02:51:17.500
going to satisfy you.

02:51:17.500 --> 02:51:24.780
And I think I really do see your point here because there is no possible way, no possible

02:51:24.780 --> 02:51:29.820
way you can adapt the Mass Effect games into a movie and leave people satisfied.

02:51:29.820 --> 02:51:35.340
They will be pissed just like Harry Potter fans always are mad that the books aren't

02:51:35.340 --> 02:51:36.700
adapted correctly.

02:51:36.780 --> 02:51:40.700
I'm sure somebody's got a problem with Lord of the Rings, although to be fair, they do

02:51:40.700 --> 02:51:41.260
it okay.

02:51:41.260 --> 02:51:44.860
But I mean, it's just Mass Effect is a video game.

02:51:44.860 --> 02:51:46.460
It is not going to work as a movie.

02:51:46.460 --> 02:51:50.460
But here's why Wreck-It Ralph worked because Wreck-It Ralph wasn't a game.

02:51:50.460 --> 02:51:53.180
It was a movie about gaming culture.

02:51:53.980 --> 02:51:54.620
Exactly.

02:51:55.580 --> 02:52:02.700
And I think, and that's why Hope is just, is viewed as a story that, you know, revolve,

02:52:02.700 --> 02:52:06.860
you know, and it's a little bit, you know, involves the characters that we all love to

02:52:06.860 --> 02:52:07.580
play with.

02:52:07.580 --> 02:52:11.180
But I just hope it doesn't go past that.

02:52:11.180 --> 02:52:16.220
It's like, you know, and still is, you know, conceived as a, you know, what video games

02:52:16.220 --> 02:52:21.180
are today as, you know, a child's toy because we have progressed so much beyond that point.

02:52:22.300 --> 02:52:22.620
All right.

02:52:22.620 --> 02:52:25.820
Well, Degener, Johnny, I gotta let you go so we can see if we can get another call and

02:52:25.820 --> 02:52:26.540
wrap up the show.

02:52:26.540 --> 02:52:27.660
But great phone call.

02:52:27.660 --> 02:52:28.460
Don't be a stranger.

02:52:29.020 --> 02:52:29.420
All right.

02:52:29.420 --> 02:52:29.740
All right.

02:52:29.740 --> 02:52:30.620
Take care.

02:52:30.620 --> 02:52:31.120
Bye.

02:52:31.120 --> 02:52:32.480
Bye.

02:52:32.480 --> 02:52:33.200
Really good points.

02:52:33.200 --> 02:52:37.200
We, I, he hasn't called into the show an awful lot, but I like some of the stuff, some of

02:52:37.200 --> 02:52:38.320
the points he was raising there.

02:52:38.320 --> 02:52:40.080
So definitely worth talking to.

02:52:40.080 --> 02:52:40.720
Appreciate it.

02:52:41.440 --> 02:52:43.120
We are the show where every gamer has a voice.

02:52:43.120 --> 02:52:47.200
1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:52:47.200 --> 02:52:50.160
If we can get another call in here real quick, we'll take it.

02:52:50.160 --> 02:52:52.720
Otherwise, we might just wrap up for the night.

02:52:52.720 --> 02:52:56.640
Let me go to Twitter though, cause I still had some more of these tweets I wanted to

02:52:56.640 --> 02:53:02.240
get to, including one from Tiger Claw that talks about the Halo 4 Amex card thing.

02:53:02.960 --> 02:53:07.360
I remember reading a little bit about this, but you know, I don't have an American Express

02:53:07.360 --> 02:53:10.480
myself, so I just kind of scrolled on by.

02:53:10.480 --> 02:53:15.280
But apparently there is a, excuse me, there is a partnership between Microsoft and American

02:53:15.280 --> 02:53:19.760
Express so that if you are a card holder, you get coupons and credits for tying your

02:53:19.760 --> 02:53:22.240
account to Xbox Live and playing Halo 4.

02:53:23.840 --> 02:53:24.960
Very interesting.

02:53:24.960 --> 02:53:30.240
If you sync your Amex account to your Xbox Live account, you can get coupons to theaters,

02:53:30.240 --> 02:53:31.600
packs on, dah, dah, dah, dah.

02:53:32.240 --> 02:53:36.560
An automatic credit of $10 in the US or 10 pounds in the UK.

02:53:36.560 --> 02:53:41.040
If you play Halo 4, you get credits and coupons on your in-game achievements.

02:53:42.640 --> 02:53:46.880
If you complete the single-player campaign on normal or harder difficulty, you get a

02:53:46.880 --> 02:53:49.040
$25 statement credit.

02:53:49.120 --> 02:53:55.920
If you are one of the first 25 people in the US to complete the campaign alone on legendary

02:53:56.560 --> 02:54:03.200
difficulty, you will be entered to win a trip to the 2013 Electronic Entertainment Expo.

02:54:03.200 --> 02:54:08.960
Well, that's not irritating or anything because, you know, E3 is a very exclusive thing to

02:54:08.960 --> 02:54:12.960
be able to get into, but apparently you can win your way in through Amex.

02:54:14.320 --> 02:54:17.440
I'm glad that the integrity is being kept up.

02:54:17.440 --> 02:54:24.320
Yes, I'm so glad that we're keeping the independent press out of the events for the nasty, filthy

02:54:24.320 --> 02:54:28.720
things they'll say about it on the internet, yet we're gonna let a contest winner from

02:54:28.720 --> 02:54:31.840
American Express get their way into the show.

02:54:31.840 --> 02:54:33.280
Uh-huh, I see how it is.

02:54:35.120 --> 02:54:37.520
Let's see, you talked about the Wizard of the Coast lawsuit thing, right?

02:54:37.520 --> 02:54:39.280
Because we have a tweet on that, but you already talked about that.

02:54:40.320 --> 02:54:42.800
Let's see, another tweet from actdeft.

02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:46.400
Is DRM going too far?

02:54:47.440 --> 02:54:51.360
Sorry, I'm reading the story here real quick.

02:54:51.360 --> 02:54:51.920
Let me look at this.

02:54:53.280 --> 02:54:54.240
The title of the...

02:54:54.240 --> 02:54:55.840
This is a forum post, okay?

02:54:56.560 --> 02:54:59.600
He links us to a forum post on overclock.net.

02:54:59.600 --> 02:55:05.360
Razor Synapse 2.0 software mouse unusable if you don't have an internet connection.

02:55:06.000 --> 02:55:12.640
The poster, who goes by Channel X99, just bought a new Naga 2012 mouse, installed the

02:55:12.640 --> 02:55:16.160
software, and got greeted by a login screen right after.

02:55:16.160 --> 02:55:19.600
No option to bypass it to use the software to configure the mouse.

02:55:19.600 --> 02:55:22.720
Set the options, sensitivity, shortcuts, macros, etc.

02:55:22.720 --> 02:55:24.880
So I create an account and try to log in.

02:55:24.880 --> 02:55:25.600
Nothing.

02:55:25.600 --> 02:55:27.200
Try several more times.

02:55:27.200 --> 02:55:27.840
Nothing.

02:55:27.840 --> 02:55:28.960
Try to make new accounts.

02:55:28.960 --> 02:55:31.040
Different email addresses won't work.

02:55:31.040 --> 02:55:36.400
Finally, call Razor, who tells me the activation server is down, and I won't be able to use

02:55:36.400 --> 02:55:41.040
the mouse until it goes back up, and will only be able to use it as a standard plug

02:55:41.040 --> 02:55:42.400
and play mouse till then.

02:55:42.960 --> 02:55:47.760
I ask about a workaround to use the mouse offline, and they say there is none.

02:55:49.200 --> 02:55:50.160
That's a stupid...

02:55:50.160 --> 02:55:52.800
That's completely awful.

02:55:52.800 --> 02:55:55.280
That I would be writing a letter to the Better Business Bureau.

02:55:55.280 --> 02:55:56.960
Which I'm about to be doing for Origin.

02:55:58.720 --> 02:56:00.240
But D.R., you can't...

02:56:01.440 --> 02:56:03.680
Do they sell counterfeit mice?

02:56:03.680 --> 02:56:04.560
I mean, is that a thing?

02:56:04.560 --> 02:56:09.760
I don't want to get political, but I'm honest to God, this is the first thought that jumps

02:56:09.760 --> 02:56:10.800
into my mind.

02:56:10.880 --> 02:56:14.880
There's this very controversial proposition on the ballot in California.

02:56:14.880 --> 02:56:16.400
It's Prop 37.

02:56:16.400 --> 02:56:19.360
And it has to do with labeling certain types of food.

02:56:19.360 --> 02:56:23.120
I'm not going to get into where I'm leaning on this proposition or whatever.

02:56:23.120 --> 02:56:24.080
I'm just going to say it's...

02:56:25.520 --> 02:56:31.040
If it passes, there's going to be additional warning labels on food and restrictions on

02:56:31.040 --> 02:56:33.040
what can be called a natural food or not.

02:56:34.240 --> 02:56:38.800
The reason why I bring that up, that mouse ought to carry a fucking sticker on it.

02:56:38.800 --> 02:56:39.760
Bright and big.

02:56:39.760 --> 02:56:44.160
Will not work without an internet connection because you, the buyer, have the right to

02:56:44.160 --> 02:56:45.840
know that shit before you buy it.

02:56:47.200 --> 02:56:48.720
Take the mouse back, buddy.

02:56:48.720 --> 02:56:50.080
Especially a mouse like that.

02:56:50.080 --> 02:56:51.520
We're not talking like a $20 mouse.

02:56:51.520 --> 02:56:54.240
We're talking like $100 plus mice.

02:56:55.680 --> 02:56:57.600
There is no reason...

02:56:57.600 --> 02:56:59.680
There should be a warning label on that mouse.

02:57:00.560 --> 02:57:02.720
And any video game that requires this shit.

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:06.640
Because an internet connection is an additional fee, right?

02:57:06.640 --> 02:57:10.880
Most MMOs I've played who have a sticker requires internet connection to play.

02:57:10.880 --> 02:57:11.840
Even games.

02:57:11.840 --> 02:57:15.520
Okay, that's a little understandable that they have DRM because they want to avoid piracy.

02:57:15.520 --> 02:57:20.480
What the fuck is DRM supposed to be for like an accessory, hardware?

02:57:20.480 --> 02:57:24.640
What the fuck do you need DRM for for a mouse?

02:57:24.640 --> 02:57:25.680
Shouldn't there be like...

02:57:25.680 --> 02:57:30.480
I hate to sound stupid and I might by saying this, but I don't care.

02:57:30.480 --> 02:57:35.760
Shouldn't there be like antitrust shit involved because you're forcing somebody to log up

02:57:35.760 --> 02:57:40.240
for your crap because you bought this particular product at the store?

02:57:41.120 --> 02:57:48.240
It's like you're making somebody sign up for this other service because of your foothold

02:57:48.240 --> 02:57:49.280
in the mouse keyboard.

02:57:50.320 --> 02:57:52.480
Isn't there a questionable legality to that?

02:57:53.840 --> 02:57:56.800
I mean, maybe because we're talking about a mice and keyboard company.

02:57:56.800 --> 02:57:59.680
It's kind of a niche market at gamers.

02:57:59.680 --> 02:58:05.200
They do have their $2,500 laptop that's coming out this week as well.

02:58:05.760 --> 02:58:06.080
Hmm.

02:58:08.240 --> 02:58:08.640
Let's see.

02:58:08.640 --> 02:58:11.520
Go into our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

02:58:11.520 --> 02:58:15.120
TigerClaw says the only thing I'm doing with the mouse or keyboard is turning the LEDs

02:58:15.120 --> 02:58:16.000
on or off.

02:58:16.000 --> 02:58:19.280
So when I go to bed, I just load up the software to turn them off.

02:58:19.280 --> 02:58:23.680
All other features it has I don't use because that's mostly features associated to gaming.

02:58:25.280 --> 02:58:31.840
One more tweet from actdeft who says fairy solitaire is free to download on steam for

02:58:31.840 --> 02:58:32.560
a few days.

02:58:33.760 --> 02:58:34.400
Who knew that?

02:58:35.200 --> 02:58:35.920
Get it now.

02:58:35.920 --> 02:58:37.120
Keep it forever.

02:58:37.120 --> 02:58:42.480
If you want the addicting card game fairy solitaire where you find and raise a fairy

02:58:42.480 --> 02:58:47.760
pet and repopulate the magical land of Avalon using the resources found by clearing each

02:58:47.760 --> 02:58:48.400
level.

02:58:48.400 --> 02:58:51.360
Sounds like you can get that on steam for free right now.

02:58:52.000 --> 02:58:55.600
And honestly, you should if you're even if you're not really that interested in it, if

02:58:55.600 --> 02:58:58.160
you're mildly interested because hey, it's free.

02:58:58.160 --> 02:59:00.560
I know I'm giggling there, but you know what?

02:59:00.560 --> 02:59:02.320
Props to them making it free.

02:59:02.320 --> 02:59:03.200
How can you?

02:59:04.080 --> 02:59:05.600
I'm sure it's better than Yaris.

02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:11.360
That is a very low bar to take seed there.

02:59:13.280 --> 02:59:19.280
All right, that's going to do it for our Twitter topic tonight and the other interactive parts

02:59:19.280 --> 02:59:19.840
of our show.

02:59:21.040 --> 02:59:22.720
We're going to close up shop.

02:59:24.640 --> 02:59:26.720
And Skype just like freeze my computer.

02:59:27.840 --> 02:59:28.720
Thanks Skype.

02:59:28.720 --> 02:59:30.880
You drop the live listeners and everything.

02:59:30.880 --> 02:59:32.160
Sorry, that was Skype's fault.

02:59:32.560 --> 02:59:33.520
Not Comcast fault.

02:59:33.520 --> 02:59:34.480
That was Skype's fault.

02:59:35.040 --> 02:59:36.320
Sorry for the stream drop there.

02:59:37.280 --> 02:59:37.600
All right.

02:59:37.600 --> 02:59:41.920
Anyhow, that's going to do it for telephone calls and Twitter and all that good stuff.

02:59:41.920 --> 02:59:43.520
Let's send the show.

02:59:43.520 --> 02:59:45.280
Do you have any other last minute stories either?

02:59:45.280 --> 02:59:46.560
You guys have something to say?

02:59:46.560 --> 02:59:46.720
Yeah.

02:59:46.720 --> 02:59:48.320
What tomorrow is my mom's birthday.

02:59:48.320 --> 02:59:49.280
So happy birthday, mom.

02:59:49.280 --> 02:59:50.320
Even though you don't listen.

02:59:50.320 --> 02:59:52.960
Happy birthday to dark soccer's mom, even though she doesn't listen.

02:59:52.960 --> 02:59:53.460
Yeah.

02:59:54.160 --> 02:59:56.080
Loki, any other last minute stories or anything?

02:59:56.080 --> 02:59:57.120
It's about slow news.

02:59:57.120 --> 03:00:00.880
We have anything MXC and chat says don't knock it.

03:00:00.880 --> 03:00:04.480
I tried playing fairy solitaire on a whim and can't stop playing.

03:00:04.480 --> 03:00:05.840
It's been three hours.

03:00:08.640 --> 03:00:12.000
I have another thing to say, but I'll say it for last.

03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:13.360
I want to quickly say this.

03:00:13.360 --> 03:00:18.640
Shane, if you're listening and you're in chat, will you link the listeners that game you

03:00:18.640 --> 03:00:21.040
were talking to me earlier on Warcraft about?

03:00:21.040 --> 03:00:22.080
It was hilarious.

03:00:22.080 --> 03:00:23.840
I wish she'd called in to talk about it.

03:00:23.840 --> 03:00:25.680
It sounded hilarious.

03:00:25.680 --> 03:00:30.640
You like start playing the game and it looks like an edutainment title that's about fractions,

03:00:30.640 --> 03:00:35.680
but then he was talking about how like it just starts pulling, like it gets weirder

03:00:35.680 --> 03:00:41.520
and weirder and weirder and like suddenly you're like at the top of this government

03:00:41.520 --> 03:00:45.200
conspiracy and it turns into a text adventure game.

03:00:45.840 --> 03:00:50.320
Like he was like, I, I tried playing it for 30 seconds and I'm like, I don't get the joke.

03:00:50.320 --> 03:00:51.520
This is a stupid game.

03:00:51.520 --> 03:00:52.400
Close window.

03:00:52.400 --> 03:00:55.760
But then he was telling me about it on vent and I was like laughing because it sounded

03:00:55.760 --> 03:00:56.720
really ridiculous.

03:00:56.720 --> 03:01:00.720
So if he's not listening, I'll get the link from him and we can talk about it next week

03:01:00.720 --> 03:01:03.680
because Loki, I think you of all of us should probably play this game.

03:01:03.680 --> 03:01:04.480
It sounds like something you'd get.

03:01:04.480 --> 03:01:05.440
Sounds awesome.

03:01:05.440 --> 03:01:06.960
You like flash games that are weird.

03:01:07.600 --> 03:01:08.320
All right.

03:01:08.320 --> 03:01:09.920
Um, okay.

03:01:09.920 --> 03:01:11.680
Let's go around to get everybody's final thought.

03:01:11.680 --> 03:01:14.000
Jamie, you had something in mind already, so I'll start with you tonight.

03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:14.560
Your final thought.

03:01:14.560 --> 03:01:15.360
I'm going to wreck it.

03:01:17.600 --> 03:01:20.320
My final thought tonight is baked potato.

03:01:21.040 --> 03:01:22.400
Loki, your final thought tonight?

03:01:22.400 --> 03:01:24.480
Um, mob arena.

03:01:24.480 --> 03:01:29.440
Hopefully they'll be coming soon and otherwise check out the map that we have for the vog

03:01:29.440 --> 03:01:29.760
server.

03:01:29.760 --> 03:01:31.520
If you're not part of it, you should join.

03:01:32.480 --> 03:01:38.480
It's fun and you get to build stuff, but if you want to check out the map, vogmc.co.cc

03:01:38.480 --> 03:01:40.080
