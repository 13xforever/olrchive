7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	20400	Tonight, November 18th, 2012, the Wii U launches in North America, loyal Microsoft users are
20400	27400	rewarded with a free Xbox 360, and PlayStation Plus is set to debut on the Vita.
27400	31400	Orange Lounge Radio
31400	39400	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio.
39400	46400	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle with my buddies.
46400	49400	Say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
49400	50400	Hi.
50400	51400	Hi, how are you?
51400	53400	I'm sick of donuts.
53400	59400	Oh god, not the hostess thing. Were you one of those people clearing out 7-Eleven?
59400	78400	No, no, actually not at all. I was watching Undersedation Live last night and they were eating, well Travis was eating Ding Dongs, Twinkies, all kinds of stuff and all of a sudden I wanted donuts and this Martin Final around the corner from my house had them.
78400	85400	So I bought 10 of them and gave a pack to a homeless guy and the rest of them are now in my fridge at home.
85400	96400	So should I have the urge to eat a donut, which I really shouldn't be because wheat makes me sick, but I have them now. I ate a pack today, I wish I hadn't.
96400	112400	Here's the thing, I'm not going to get into the whole why about it, but I'm going to tell you why the closure pisses me off is because Hostess also makes, and I don't know if this is a nationwide thing, it might be a regional thing, but they make this bread called Columbo Bread, which is the sourdough bread that is so flipping good.
112400	114400	Columbo is its own brand.
114400	115400	Right, but it's part of Hostess.
115400	117400	I know, right, but Columbo also makes frozen yogurt.
117400	118400	Oh, okay.
118400	127400	Columbo also makes a bunch of other baked goods, but they also do, because it used to be a major competitor for the company that my dad used to work for.
127400	133400	My dad used to work for a distributor called W.J. Powell Company and they did a different bread for their supplier.
133400	137400	Columbo was one of the big southern competitors.
137400	142400	Oh, I always thought they were based out here because San Francisco is sourdough bread.
142400	144400	Yeah, but they also do other kinds of breads.
144400	145400	Oh, okay.
145400	152400	It's a national bread company and they also do frozen yogurt and other, let's see what I'm thinking of, mass distribution foods.
152400	158400	Well, my point was, I'm not going to be able to get that sourdough bread anymore, at least until somebody buys the company or whatever.
158400	160400	Well, you can go to Fucking Boudin and get good bread.
160400	166400	But I love Columbo Bread, you shut up. Alright. Also, say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
166400	170400	I completely was ignoring everything you guys were talking about for the last minute or two.
170400	173400	Hostess, you don't have an opinion on Twinkies?
173400	174400	I don't like them.
174400	179400	I think people are going way too crazy over this, but it's because everybody remembers them from a kid.
179400	186400	Like, I don't know about you guys, but like a Twinkie was like a staple dessert that came with your little bag lunch.
186400	189400	Holy crap, it's cake with frosting inside.
189400	193400	Wow, no one will ever be able to do that.
194400	199400	Well, Little Debbie, if you eat Little Debbie stuff, strawberry shortcakes are superior.
199400	203400	No, no, no, no. It's all about oatmeal cream pies.
203400	211400	I don't know if they actually had like a Hostess like end cap or whatever at our local grocery store, and now it's all Little Debbie stuff now.
211400	218400	They just like completely removed it all. I don't know if they have like return it all before, you know, their, you know.
218400	223400	Little Debbie was probably the one that, you know, convinced them all to join the union and all that. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I don't want to go there.
223400	229400	All right. Also say hello to the one, the only Jason is joining us in studio tonight.
229400	230400	Hello again, everybody.
230400	234400	Mr. VX Jason X V X Y Z Q R S T U P.
234400	235400	Yeah.
235400	236400	Hey for me.
236400	237400	How you doing?
238400	248400	I'm tired from zipping south of San Francisco and north of San Francisco and train for much too long as usual and you know, but I'm here. So why not?
248400	250400	And commuting back and forth from Colorado.
250400	251400	Uh huh.
251400	261400	Which by the way, being that you see, politics is pretty bad here because you know, it's bad everywhere, but like at least we're not a swing state.
261400	263400	Like everybody knew how California was going to vote.
263400	264400	Oh yeah.
264400	269400	Your state on the other hand. Oh my God. You must be really fucking sick of politics.
269400	273400	And this is I not watching TV.
273400	282400	The only exposure to politics that I had was every once in a while that Facebook either a sponsored post or you know, a friend liking something that shows up on my feed.
282400	284400	It was surprisingly minimal.
284400	289400	I didn't get too much of it and I could very easily just skim the sponsored posts.
289400	299400	But the one thing that I did get is YouTube partner channels. The ones that actually monetize their channel. Politic two minute political ads every single video.
299400	307400	And there have been a couple of gaming shows. The Continue Show, Game Grumps, and then individually John Chon and Egoraptor.
307400	310400	I've been watching a ton of their videos and they all monetize.
310400	319400	So the start of every episode, the end of every episode for whatever reason, even though you can just skip it, and the middle of particularly long episodes.
319400	323400	Political ad, political ad, political ad, political ad, political ad.
323400	327400	So it wasn't terribly specific for my region, but it still sucked.
327400	332400	This is why you don't see Wii U commercials anywhere because the politicians bought up all the ad space.
332400	333400	Yeah, they really did.
333400	334400	There it is.
334400	338400	I'm going to have fun trivia about politics since we're on the subject to get it out of the way.
338400	342400	So everybody knows the two candidates that were in all 50 states.
342400	348400	Most people know that there are actually six candidates that are in 47 of the states, I think.
348400	349400	Like Roseanne.
349400	354400	Correct. Roseanne Barr, Jill Stein, Gary Johnson, and I always forget the fourth guy.
354400	356400	Columbus voted for Jill Stein, by the way.
356400	357400	Virgil something.
357400	361400	Yeah, Virgil Goode. Virgil Goode. Somebody always remembers that name when I never do. It's the weirdest thing.
361400	363400	You know how many presidential candidates were on the Colorado ballot?
363400	364400	How many?
364400	365400	Sixteen.
365400	366400	Wow.
366400	375400	Yeah. I don't know if it was sarcastic, but somebody told me that the only thing you have to do to get on the ballot is to have some kind of party application.
375400	379400	You have to have some kind of a political party and pay $500.
379400	384400	Now, okay, I'm not going to ask you how you voted in elections because that's, you know, a touchy subject and whatever.
384400	390400	But also I do want to remind everybody, it is a video game show and there is the always present extra guest in our chat room.
390400	391400	Hi, everybody.
391400	393400	Duke Nukem says don't fuck with Roseanne.
393400	398400	We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, voguesnetwork.com.
398400	403400	Six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. It is a live experience.
403400	405400	But of course, we love the podcasties as well.
405400	407400	And he said, yeah, Duke Nukem says don't fuck with Roseanne.
407400	409400	So Duke Nukem must have been a Roseanne fan.
409400	416400	I'm not going to ask about the big one because, you know, that's still got a lot of, like, a lot of ruffled feathers and so forth.
416400	424400	But I got to know, how do you feel being in one of these states where you can get weed anywhere you want now?
424400	425400	It is legal weed.
425400	426400	Up to an ounce.
426400	427400	Up to an ounce.
427400	428400	Up to an ounce.
428400	429400	I don't, I.
429400	430400	I know you're not a smoker.
430400	433400	And to be fair, disclaimer, nobody here at OLR, like, actually smokes it.
433400	434400	But, you know, I.
434400	435400	I love brownies.
435400	437400	I find the cold.
437400	438400	I just, I.
438400	441400	That's how I found out I wasn't actually allergic to the substance.
441400	442400	I'm allergic to the smoke.
442400	446400	I actually eat all that snacky food because I'm just a fat pig.
446400	448400	Like, I'm not even smoking weed.
448400	449400	I'm just a fat pig.
449400	452400	But how do you feel about all that being in that state?
452400	464400	The best thing that's come out of this is the humor on Facebook and the local communities because of how many people I follow that live in the area go figure that the the jokes, the pictures, the memes, they are actually pretty damn funny.
464400	467400	Getting high while you are actually high in the Mile High City?
467400	470400	That's a new one to me, actually.
470400	472400	I just like the one of the fog rolling in.
472400	473400	Yes. Yes.
473400	475400	Suddenly in Colorado.
475400	485400	Well, my my my favorite as well is the whole fact that, like, it's a fucking cruel joke that hostess closes the week after they legalize marijuana in two states.
485400	490400	And it's like, what kind of fucking stupid business decision was that?
490400	493400	Maybe you own Twinkies.
493400	495400	You were sitting on a gold mine anyway.
496400	502400	No, they were too busy giving themselves raises and not worrying about things like benefits.
502400	503400	All right. All right.
503400	504400	And pensions.
504400	506400	Fucking greedy ass fuckers.
506400	520400	But since we're all look, since we're all like under the age of like 50, I'm sure we can agree that yay to those states that finally voted the right way and either legalized or stop the banning of, you know, marriage and all that.
520400	521400	So, of course.
521400	522400	Yay to Washington and all that.
522400	528400	It makes it more difficult because we have to watch out for for state officials.
528400	530400	We don't have to watch out for state officials.
530400	539400	But when we hear about a federal raid, then it becomes a little bit more dangerous because as the disclaimer goes, it is still illegal at the federal level, which ultimately supersedes state law.
539400	541400	All right. Anyhow, we got to get to video games.
541400	542400	It's been a busy week in video games.
542400	544400	We're getting too political.
544400	545400	Let's pause. Shut up.
545400	546400	Don't talk about politics.
546400	548400	I tuned in here about games.
548400	550400	Fine. We can talk games.
550400	554400	Let's talk about Wii U, obviously.
554400	561400	Everybody's heard that joke, but in part to Bobby, who does the show before us every week.
561400	564400	But Big Day in Nintendo World, the Wii U launched.
564400	566400	How are we feeling about the Wii U?
566400	569400	So I teased before the show.
569400	571400	One of us did get the Wii U.
571400	575400	Jason, was it you?
575400	577400	No, I've been busy in California.
577400	579400	Dark Soccer, did you buy the Wii U?
579400	580400	I'm not a whore.
580400	583400	So that means it's between Loki and myself.
583400	586400	Now, Loki, you do work for the distribution company.
586400	588400	I do work for a distribution company.
588400	592400	And you've been shading the shit out of Nintendo on the past few episodes of the show.
592400	593400	That's true.
593400	596400	Did you have a change of heart and did you buy a Wii U?
596400	598400	No, I already own a Wii.
598400	601400	Yes, it was me. I bought the Wii U this morning.
601400	602400	Surprise.
602400	603400	I did. Yep.
603400	606400	So let's talk about the Wii U a little bit.
606400	609400	I guess I'll start since, you know, I actually have one.
609400	610400	No, here's the thing.
610400	614400	I went back and forth on that Wii U thing a lot.
614400	617400	I made a very cryptic tweet last night talking about...
617400	618400	Because here's the thing.
618400	623400	I chose not to go out and stand in line and all that stuff for the Wii U last night
623400	627400	because Irene, who a lot of you old school OLR listeners know,
627400	628400	she used to be on the show all the time.
628400	631400	Irene was visiting and...
631400	633400	I'm trying to make it sound like she doesn't live here,
633400	635400	but she came over and we went out for her birthday.
635400	640400	So I chose to go get drunk at a gay bar rather than go stand out in line.
640400	642400	I think I made the right decision.
642400	644400	So I pretty much convinced myself, you know what?
644400	645400	I don't need a Wii U.
645400	646400	I'm not going to get one.
646400	647400	I'm over it.
647400	649400	You know, I'll get one in January or whatever.
649400	656400	And then this morning, I fire up the Target app and I just look out of curiosity.
656400	658400	It's like 11 o'clock.
658400	660400	They're still in stock at the store nearby.
660400	662400	Let's just go take a look.
662400	664400	Walk out of there with my Wii U Deluxe set.
664400	665400	Not only are you a whore...
665400	666400	I found one at noon.
666400	668400	I found one at noon, still on a shelf in Target.
668400	671400	Not only are you a whore, you're a waffling whore.
671400	676400	So they're not sold out like the Wii.
676400	677400	Oh, I guess...
677400	680400	They probably are now, to be fair, because there were two left and I bought one.
680400	681400	So...
681400	684400	See, Nintendo, Apple helps you sell your stuff.
684400	687400	If you're going to pick any mobile platform, Apple.
687400	689400	I'm sure that isn't a surprise to hear me say ever.
689400	692400	So to be honest, I've only really been able to spend like 30 minutes
692400	694400	playing actual games on the console.
694400	697400	Because as I'm sure you all heard, there's that massive 5 gigabyte update.
697400	699400	And that took an hour out.
699400	701400	And you know, I had to do other stuff to prep for the show.
701400	704400	So I didn't have a whole lot of time to really sit down with the Wii U.
704400	705400	But I'm going to tell you like this.
705400	710400	This is the impression I got of the Wii U with the little time I had playing it.
710400	713400	You know, this isn't a reference everybody's going to get.
713400	717400	If you live in Northern California, you know the Winchester Mystery House.
718400	723400	Dar Sacra, for those that don't live in Northern California, please explain the Winchester Mystery House.
723400	725400	The Winchester Mystery House is in San Jose.
725400	730400	It was built by this lady named Sarah Winchester, who was married to the Mr. Winchester,
730400	732400	who made all the guns and killed people.
732400	734400	Well, his guns killed people.
734400	740400	And, well, she thought she was being haunted by the ghost of everyone who had ever died with one of the Winchester rifles.
740400	742400	So she went to a medium who said,
742400	745400	Yeah, you're being haunted, so you have to build a house to trap all the ghosts in.
745400	747400	And if you stop building, you'll die.
747400	754400	Well, she built a house seven stories tall, with all these rooms and construction never stopped during her life.
754400	756400	Until she died, then construction stopped.
756400	760400	The top three floors were knocked off during an earthquake.
760400	764400	And now the rest of it's been turned into sort of a tourist trap.
764400	765400	But it's a really neat house.
765400	767400	There's stairs that go into the ceiling.
767400	772400	She has very small doors, and because Ms. Winchester had horrible arthritis and was very short,
772400	776400	she has these little tiny steps that go in spirals all through the house.
776400	780400	There's a seance room that has, I think, seven doors in and no doors out.
780400	783400	There's a door that opens just to the outside from the second story.
783400	785400	Oops, dead.
785400	788400	There's a huge basement. People see ghosts there, all kinds of stuff.
788400	792400	So there's a reason I have Dark Sakura tell that story, because that's how I kind of feel about the Wii U,
792400	795400	is that, like, there's these doors that you'll open and there's a wall there.
795400	798400	And there'll be, like, a half-finished tunnel.
798400	803400	And it's like, oh, you can click on Amazon Prime, and then it's like, surprise, it's fucking nothing.
803400	805400	You know, like that gif.
805400	807400	It's like, there's all these weird, unfinished things.
807400	812400	And I really feel like so much of the infrastructure, they're building as they go along.
812400	815400	Like, it was some mandate within Nintendo.
815400	819400	That fucking thing is coming out on November 18th, come hell or high water,
819400	821400	no matter what has to happen to make that happen.
821400	824400	So there's still a lot of unfinished stuff.
824400	828400	But, Loki, before you get your smart-ass comment out, I'm going to say on the plus side,
828400	834400	getting to play Mario in HD, with what little time I spent with it so far,
834400	837400	it's a pretty solid Mario game, and I'm really enjoying it.
837400	844400	And just kind of like, wow, it looks great, and it plays neat, and so far I'm enjoying it.
844400	853400	I also really love the subtle touch of the music being different on the television and on the Wii U gamepad.
853400	857400	Like, it is really cute how, like, some instruments will be on the TV and some are on the gamepad.
857400	862400	It creates this really neat 3D sound that you don't really have anywhere else.
862400	866400	And it's kind of a neat little, it's a neat little thing. I like that.
866400	871400	So yes, Loki, I know you're dying to comment on my consumer horridom, so please.
871400	875400	No, I'm just saying that I don't know why you're surprised that there's stuff that's not finished for the Wii U launch.
875400	880400	They did the same thing with the Wii, the DS, the 3DS, it's just Nintendo.
880400	885400	And they're, well, we want people to buy our stuff, but oh hey, it's not complete.
885400	890400	You know, all those wonderful features that we were pimping out during our E3 conferences,
890400	894400	hey, TV, Nintendo TV, nope, not fucking there.
894400	900400	Oh hey, Rayman Legends, really awesome launch game, launch window, by launch window he means coming out five months later.
900400	903400	I mean, come on.
903400	908400	At the end of the day though, what's the rule, the system is only as good as the games that are on it, blah blah blah, right?
908400	912400	So how solid are the games? And I think the question you have to ask yourself is do you need this new Mario game,
912400	915400	because that's clearly the all-star out of the bunch, I think for most people.
915400	919400	Although ZombiU, a lot of people are saying really nice things about that.
919400	924400	I haven't played it myself, but I'm hearing if you like old school Resident Evil games.
924400	929400	And then Nintendo Land, your typical pack-in game.
929400	934400	You know, I only did a little bit of Nintendo Land, but I like some of the variety in some of the games.
935400	941400	I don't think Wii Sports level is going to draw people in, but I think it's a neat way to show off the console.
941400	948400	I did a video chat too with Shane, and it's okay.
948400	951400	I mean, the quality is kind of comparable to FaceTime.
951400	957400	It's a little slow to connect, and then it does this really weird transition thing when you connect to the other person,
957400	960400	where it ripples in, and it plays this music like,
961400	966400	It's like this big debut, like, oh my god, I'm going to video chat!
966400	971400	And then like, oh hey, it's Shane. I haven't seen him before.
971400	976400	It's just like, oh, your princess is in another castle, but here's Shane.
980400	981400	Poor Shane.
981400	987400	But the quality was good enough that I could see his doggy running down the stairs in the back of the room,
987400	992400	and I was like, oh, although when he was looking at my setup,
992400	996400	Jason was sitting back here at the table, and I'm like, Shane, say hi to Jason.
996400	1000400	He's like, hi, he's doing that whole, I don't know who I'm saying hi to,
1000400	1003400	and he told me later, he's like, yeah, I couldn't see Jason,
1003400	1007400	but I could totally make out the Wendy's bag that was sitting on the table, so I know where he ate dinner.
1010400	1013400	And that's how I really want to be remembered. My last meal.
1014400	1021400	And then you can draw on it, but, you know, so I was writing, like, hello, and all that stupid stuff.
1021400	1026400	So anyway, my time with the Wii U has been interesting so far.
1026400	1028400	I think they're going to kind of keep adding to it.
1028400	1033400	And at the end of the day, if you want a Wii U, you just have to ask yourself, how bad do I want the games?
1033400	1036400	Because the infrastructure right now is not really where it's at.
1036400	1042400	Like, there's still a lot of, like, I want to be able to explain Miiverse to all of you.
1042400	1047400	I don't fucking understand it at all. Like, I thought it was supposed to be like Twitter,
1047400	1051400	but you don't really make public posts. You can either send messages to people,
1051400	1056400	or you comment on community posts, which in turn are public.
1056400	1059400	And people, like, I don't fucking get it.
1059400	1065400	It's okay. Nintendo doesn't fucking get it either. They just put this shit together and, like, done.
1065400	1071400	It looks like Facebook or Twitter. We're gonna just say this is our online network right here.
1072400	1075400	Raginator in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,
1075400	1078400	So, what was the TTP for the newer listeners?
1078400	1082400	It's an old OLR acronym for Time to Penis. Whenever there is a new piece of hardware,
1082400	1085400	we always measure what's going to be the time before somebody puts their dick in it.
1085400	1087400	Oh, I'm sure it was a few seconds.
1087400	1090400	No, because he's asking, what was the TTP with the video chat?
1090400	1095400	Shane and I don't, we're just friends, so that was not a thing. Sorry.
1095400	1096400	But I'm sure somebody else-
1096400	1100400	But Rob totally had a penis up on his iPhone.
1100400	1102400	I'm kidding. I don't know.
1102400	1106400	I'm like, I did? Maybe if I was looking at porn. I don't know. Alright, anyway.
1106400	1108400	But, yeah, that wasn't part of it.
1108400	1112400	So, let's see. Tigerclaw says,
1112400	1117400	One thing's for sure. Expect Rob to post nothing but kiddie pics on the Wii U.
1117400	1124400	I would love to post a broad- like, I would- if you want to follow me on the Miiverse thing,
1124400	1127400	although I'm not sure what that will accomplish, but I'm Rob Roberts.
1127400	1130400	So, all one word, Rob Roberts, so you can follow me or whatever.
1130400	1136400	And I'll be happy to post kiddie pictures publicly, but I can't- like, it won't let me do it.
1136400	1141400	Like, I don't know how- like, unless I go randomly reply to some community message,
1141400	1146400	like, oh, no one care about the Skylanders community, let me just go post my kiddie pics here.
1146400	1152400	Like, we need- all the Nintendo communities in Miiverse right now are just game communities.
1152400	1154400	Like, I need a kiddie community.
1155400	1159400	Where's my lolcat community? Anyhow.
1159400	1164400	Well, they don't understand online. It's just- it's the way it is.
1164400	1169400	Yeah, now they have online. They have something that sort of resembles what we had last generation.
1169400	1175400	You know, if we're gonna consider this another generation, but they just don't get it still.
1175400	1181400	And, I don't know, it's just- enjoy, I guess.
1181400	1187400	I'm gonna be honest. I'm gonna be honest. My early thought, and keep in mind, early impressions can sometimes change.
1187400	1190400	So here's my disclaimer. This is my early thought.
1190400	1196400	I kind of think the Wii U is not- I mean, it's not a next-gen system. It's not.
1196400	1200400	It is more the pinnacle of this generation.
1201400	1205400	I get what they're trying to do with the whole controller thing. It is kind of a neat experience.
1205400	1208400	I'll give them that. It's, you know, I hazed it a lot earlier on.
1208400	1215400	But that tablet is really fucking crystal clear, and it does enhance some of the games. It's pretty neat.
1215400	1225400	But I'm not sure, like, I really don't feel like I am in the next gen of gaming, or this is really pushing the envelope as far as graphics and everything go.
1225400	1230400	No, it's more like Nintendo's finally playing catch-up. Yay, they're caught up. You know?
1230400	1231400	Until next year.
1231400	1236400	Now I get to finally play Mario in HD and so forth. So, at least that's where I'm at right now.
1236400	1241400	Rama in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Reggie said it wasn't next gen.
1241400	1250400	And you know, that's a fair response, because we as gamers make all this shit a competition sometimes.
1250400	1256400	You know, and Nintendo is trying to say, wait a minute, wait a minute, no, we're not a next gen, we're the other gen.
1256400	1259400	It was the exact same thing with the Wii. It was the exact same thing with the Wii.
1259400	1263400	That's just an easy way to argue that your system sucks. I mean, it's-
1263400	1264400	Well, hold on though.
1264400	1269400	Oh, we're not competing with anybody, we're in our own market, therefore we're number one. I mean, that's stupid.
1269400	1275400	But the Wii sold more than PlayStations and Xboxes, that is fact. You cannot dispute that.
1275400	1279400	The Wii was the winner of those last three consoles. Whether you like it or not, that's the way it is.
1279400	1284400	Well, it's because they had a great pack-in game, everyone bought it. Not gonna happen this generation though.
1284400	1288400	Nothing wrong with that last generation, but I think I agree with him about the Wii U.
1289400	1298400	And I think I said as much when I called after I was at the launch experience, is that because of the higher tier in order to actually have a pack-in,
1298400	1304400	and the fact that there is not something that you just drop into, it's been forever since I played Wii Sports,
1304400	1310400	you turn it on, you pick a game, and you start playing. There are a lot more hurdles from what I've seen of the Wii U,
1310400	1315400	and that's unfortunately quite detrimental to the commoner.
1315400	1321400	The thing with the Wii U is that they assume they're really targeting this at people that bought Wiis.
1321400	1327400	They're not targeting this at new consumers, because if you're a new consumer, then guess what?
1327400	1332400	You can't play multiplayer, because you got one fucking controller and no other controllers with it.
1332400	1336400	You have to go buy all those $40 controllers, and all the nunchucks that go along with that,
1336400	1343400	and all the other accessories that you need to play those games, because once again, they marketed this at people that own the Wii.
1343400	1351400	And those people that own the Wii, some of whom, yes, will buy the system, but you're not gonna see old folks' homes or anything like that,
1351400	1356400	purchasing this to play Nintendo Land, no one's gonna give a fuck, because they're playing Wii Sports still.
1356400	1361400	I just, you know what, okay, I gotta wrap up, because I gotta go to the next thing, because we have another big thing coming up,
1361400	1363400	even before gaming weeks, we got another big thing.
1363400	1366400	And you know, I seriously have nothing to say about any of this.
1366400	1368400	Really? As a gamer, you have no opinion?
1368400	1371400	Because I don't have one, probably not gonna get one.
1372400	1375400	I mean, yeah, it's nice. I told Dan I kinda wanted one.
1375400	1379400	You know, but I can't talk about something that I don't own.
1379400	1384400	And it's also, it's not something, and I say this to everybody, it's not something you really, like, have to have.
1384400	1389400	No. I mean, like, you know what I'm more excited about? Fucking Omega.
1390400	1391400	And that's what you're into.
1391400	1392400	Yeah.
1392400	1395400	Here's the thing, here's the thing, and I wanna kind of start to wrap this up, and I wanna make this comment,
1395400	1398400	is that, you know, despite all of that that you guys are saying with Wii U,
1398400	1401400	I really think this thing is down a similar path as 3DS.
1401400	1404400	And I realize 3DS to some extent is struggling as well,
1404400	1407400	but I think Wii U is gonna gain a lot of steam next holiday,
1407400	1410400	because you know that big holiday game's coming out,
1410400	1414400	that Zelda's coming out next Christmas, or the big Metroid or something.
1414400	1418400	There will be a huge game, and one thing Nintendo does very well,
1418400	1422400	the characters in the story, love it or not, they have rabid fans.
1422400	1426400	And that's gonna sway a lot of people to picking those up even next holiday,
1426400	1431400	even with new Xbox and new PlayStation possibly out on the market.
1431400	1433400	And I guess this is a whole other can of worms.
1433400	1435400	I think we'll have new Xbox.
1435400	1437400	I'm not so sure right now we're gonna have a new PlayStation next year.
1437400	1440400	I don't see why they should be in a rush.
1440400	1443400	Why should there be a new Xbox by the same token?
1443400	1446400	Honestly, I don't think it's really gonna be, they're not gonna be worried about it,
1446400	1450400	because the longer they take on their systems, the better they're gonna be.
1450400	1454400	And if you think about it, if they're, okay, let's just say this system is not next-gen,
1454400	1456400	this system is current-gen.
1456400	1458400	How are you gonna compete against the Xbox?
1458400	1462400	The Xbox, or the PlayStation 3 for that matter, they have a huge library of games,
1462400	1464400	and they're probably gonna be cheaper.
1464400	1466400	So, why should I?
1466400	1470400	And that's the other problem too, is like, I have an Xbox 360 and a PlayStation 3,
1470400	1473400	and even if I just had one of those, there's no need for me to buy a Wii U,
1473400	1477400	unless I really want to play New Super Mario Brothers in HD,
1477400	1480400	which, you know, it's kind of like, you know,
1480400	1485400	I probably would have already played it on the Wii, or on the 3DS, or on the DS.
1485400	1491400	And it's just not that, no, it's just like throwing a fresh coat of paint on an old game.
1491400	1492400	It's fun.
1492400	1497400	Yeah, cool, Mario games are fun, and I can play New Super Mario Brothers on the Wii,
1497400	1499400	on the 3DS, on the DS.
1499400	1507400	I don't need to buy a brand new system for $350, plus the game, to play it.
1507400	1510400	Play it, it's not worth $410.
1510400	1515400	Alright, we have a whole nother year to debate this shit until the next console comes out.
1515400	1518400	I do want to transition to something else here, Jason, final thought.
1518400	1525400	Um, long-term claim chowder, because of his kid, Loki's gonna be surprisingly in Nintendo camp in about four years, five years?
1525400	1528400	Nah, he'll train the kid to love Call of Duty.
1528400	1530400	He's not gonna love Call of Duty.
1530400	1533400	He can love whatever he wants, but that still doesn't matter.
1533400	1536400	Because if he wants to play a Mario game, guess what?
1536400	1541400	There's the Nintendo, there's the Super Nintendo, there's the Game Boy, there's the DS, there's the Wii.
1541400	1544400	I have plenty of Nintendo consoles to play all these stupid games.
1544400	1549400	I don't need to buy a brand new system to play New Super Mario Brothers with a fresh coat of paint.
1549400	1550400	No, forget it.
1550400	1552400	Yet you already have that many of them.
1552400	1555400	No, I don't have those systems, but I have emulators.
1555400	1561400	I can emulate all those systems and I have a Wii, which, let's see, the last time I played that Wii was a few years ago.
1561400	1565400	Well, actually it was a couple months ago, but that was my wife playing the Wii.
1565400	1570400	Alright, we're gonna go to a call, because we're gonna go have a chat with Rama.
1570400	1575400	And I believe he has a friend there with him, too, from...
1575400	1577400	Hi, you there, Rama?
1577400	1578400	I'm right here.
1578400	1581400	Hey, and you have a buddy with you, right? From AJS?
1581400	1584400	Yeah, hold on for one second, I'm gonna bring him right in.
1584400	1585400	And he's right there.
1585400	1589400	Oh, hey, look at that. Conference call on Skype. Hey, how you doing?
1589400	1591400	Doing fabulous.
1591400	1594400	This is... Forgive me if I'm saying this wrong, Taiki?
1594400	1595400	Taiki.
1595400	1597400	Taiki, how you doing?
1597400	1598400	Fabulous. Fantastic.
1598400	1601400	Awesome. So you guys were at the launch event last night, right?
1601400	1603400	That's correct, sir.
1603400	1610400	And so I'm guessing, you know, all them media cameras were everywhere and it was hype, hype, hype, hype. Was it hype, hype, hype?
1610400	1612400	No.
1612400	1615400	To me it was a lot of hype and a lot of the chill, chill, chill.
1615400	1616400	Yeah?
1616400	1633400	Well, from what I observed, some media, but you know how media goes. It was a little directed. Nintendo told them where to go, what to shoot, at least as far as I could tell.
1633400	1642400	There was a lot going on in the crowd, but it seemed like the media really didn't want to be there.
1642400	1644400	Wow.
1644400	1646400	That was my, that was my, that's my opinion.
1646400	1653400	You know what though? From my limited time when I was studying to be originally in college, I was going to be a broadcast journalist. Here I am.
1653400	1663400	That doesn't surprise me. They get very unenthusiastic about a lot of things. I think it's just, you know, you build up a resistance to hype, you know, but anyway.
1663400	1664400	Right.
1664400	1673400	So you guys both went as media to cover it and so forth for AJS and OLR, but did you guys walk out of there with one? Rama?
1673400	1674400	No.
1674400	1675400	No? Taiki?
1675400	1676400	Nope.
1676400	1678400	No? What, what made you not want to do it?
1678400	1688400	I had to go see my folks next, next month. So between, between that, yeah. Plus I would also be massively jumping the line, although that would have been great.
1688400	1690400	Oh, did they sell out that night?
1690400	1704400	No, but there was a considerable line. After the event ended, we all went to McDonald's to get a little, to get a little nosh. And when we left heading back to the train station, we noticed that there were still about, I would say about 50 to 100 people still in line.
1704400	1705400	Wow.
1705400	1706400	Yeah.
1706400	1717400	And from my knowledge, the line went up until about five o'clock in the morning because some people on my Facebook, oh, let's just say one of my friends kind of went home dejected.
1717400	1719400	Oh, ouch.
1719400	1730400	That's unfortunate. All right. Well, you guys are at the event and you guys got some interviews and so forth. So we want to play those here on the show. So tell us about what I'm playing.
1730400	1735400	Well, the ones with the market share, that was Taiki's idea. Taiki, you take that one.
1735400	1753400	Okay. So we were at the Duane Reade across the street from the Nintendo World Store, you know, preparing. We had about four hours to go. So I'm thinking, it's time for some Red Bull. So we leave and I'm looking at the line and I was thinking there's probably something interesting, something interesting here.
1753400	1761400	I mean, he's got a lot of people here who obviously enjoy fun. Let's bring it down a little. Let's do something a little more fun.
1761400	1778400	My thought was we need to do something with these people in line. And, you know, you've seen those segments on Conan where they send someone like Triumph or whoever to the line and they start, you know, I was thinking we need to do something like that, but not insulting, but very funny and very much inside gaming.
1778400	1795400	So my idea was let's start asking people who, you know, look like they're a little older, who will know older consoles. What will the Wii U do to the market share for, say, the Dreamcast or the Neo Geo or the Jaguar?
1795400	1803400	All right. Let's check out some of these interviews with people and gauging the impact of the Wii U on the market share.
1803400	1806400	We found this man in line. What is your name, sir?
1807400	1809400	John, but you can call me the Hux.
1809400	1814400	The Hux? Interesting. So Wii U, what do you think?
1814400	1823400	It looks like a very interesting console. Good innovation. I'm really impressed with the changes they've made to the network specifically.
1823400	1830400	But some of the launch titles look good. I'm sure it's only going to go uphill from here. And I'm really impressed with the controller as well.
1830400	1836400	Okay. And speaking of the controller, how do you think that the Wii U is going to impact the Dreamcast market share?
1836400	1843400	The Dreamcast market share. Dreamcast is probably the best system, number one. And all I know is if I want to...
1843400	1846400	You're very brave saying that in front of the Nintendo World Store, sir.
1846400	1859400	Hey. Dreamcast. Go buy one. Buy some CD-ROMs. Go get a disc burner. I don't know what you're going to do. Put some games on there. Play that up.
1859400	1865400	This man knows what's up. This man knows what's up.
1866400	1868400	Your name, sir? Jason.
1868400	1870400	Jason, what do you think of the Wii U?
1870400	1874400	I'm really excited for the Wii U. I've always been a hardcore Nintendo fan, so...
1874400	1879400	What do you think of the new controller? I think it's awesome, dude. I think it's a big step forward in gaming in general.
1879400	1884400	So, what do you think that the Wii U is going to do to the TurboGrafx-16's market share?
1885400	1887400	So, that's a serious question?
1887400	1889400	Dead serious.
1889400	1892400	You know what? I'm not even worried about market shares.
1892400	1897400	So, wait a minute. We've got a new Mario game. How do you think that's going to compare to Bonk?
1897400	1901400	I mean, Bonk has its place. You can't take that away from Bonk.
1901400	1904400	The man knows the stuff. Let's go.
1904400	1906400	And your name, sir?
1906400	1908400	My name is Plino Bozzato.
1908400	1911400	Alright, and what do you think of the Wii U?
1911400	1916400	I think it's going to be awesome. I'm really excited about that. I really am.
1916400	1918400	What do you think of the new controller?
1918400	1922400	I think it's very innovative. It's fresh.
1922400	1928400	And it's nice because after the Wii, which was very innovative and brought something new,
1928400	1933400	I think this controller is a follow-up and it's really nice. Can't wait.
1933400	1937400	What do you think that the Wii U is going to do to the Neo Geo's market share?
1937400	1945400	Oh, wow. I don't have an idea. I hope it's going to keep the leadership that we brought.
1945400	1947400	I don't know.
1947400	1948400	Thank you.
1948400	1949400	You're welcome.
1949400	1950400	My name is Kim.
1950400	1953400	Hi, Kim. What do you think of the Wii U?
1953400	1956400	I think it's amazing. I can't wait to play it. I'm so excited.
1956400	1958400	So what do you think of the new Wii U controller?
1958400	1964400	It's actually very light. I've played it before, so it's surprisingly light and it's just amazing.
1964400	1966400	It brings the whole game to life.
1966400	1970400	So what do you think that the Wii U is going to do to the Sega Saturn's market share?
1970400	1972400	Sega Saturn?
1972400	1974400	Sega Saturn.
1974400	1980400	Panzer Dragoon, Virtuon, Virtua Fighter.
1980400	1982400	Your name, sir?
1982400	1983400	Carlos Rivera.
1983400	1985400	Carlos, what do you think of the Wii U?
1985400	1990400	Oh, I'm very excited about it. I've been reading up on it since they announced it was going to come out,
1990400	1993400	and that's why I'm here now, to get it.
1993400	1995400	Excellent, excellent. What do you think of the new controller?
1995400	1999400	Oh, I love the tablet controller. I love the fact that it's a tablet.
1999400	2004400	You can play the games on it, other than your screen. I love that.
2004400	2007400	What do you think this is going to do to the Atari Jaguar's market share?
2007400	2012400	The Atari Jaguar has that 16 numpad button controller.
2012400	2014400	Well...
2014400	2015400	That was pretty innovative.
2015400	2021400	It was pretty innovative, but I'm going to be looking into that too, of course.
2021400	2022400	Excellent, excellent.
2022400	2026400	Do you think maybe that girl might have known what an N-Gage was?
2026400	2029400	Maybe she should have checked on that market share. I don't know.
2029400	2032400	She's like, what's a Sega Saturn? I don't know.
2032400	2035400	That just makes me hurt in my heart.
2035400	2038400	Please, no one remembered what the N-Gage was.
2038400	2042400	I love the people in the background going, whoa, Wii U, whoa!
2042400	2044400	Sega Saturn, I'm not into astronomy.
2044400	2046400	I used to have an N-Gage.
2046400	2048400	Yeah, I know.
2048400	2050400	Yeah, we gave it away.
2050400	2054400	So, Loki, I thought I saw you kind of twitching over there a little bit
2054400	2057400	when they were asking about the tablets,
2057400	2059400	and some of the people were kind of giving the same answer.
2059400	2062400	So innovative, so different, so new, so fresh.
2062400	2065400	No, that's not an answer. That's just like a canned answer.
2065400	2069400	That is literally right there. That is subliminal advertising.
2069400	2074400	Basically, they keep hearing it repeated to them that this is so innovative and stuff,
2074400	2077400	and then they go and say, oh, yeah, it's so innovative.
2077400	2079400	That's what they tell their friends.
2079400	2082400	What is so fucking innovative about this tablet?
2082400	2085400	Oh, it's a tablet that exists pretty much on everything right now.
2085400	2087400	It is a shit ton better than SmartGlass, I'll tell you that.
2087400	2089400	Oh, come on. That's just stupid.
2089400	2093400	SmartGlass is just a glitchy app that's early in the development cycle right now.
2093400	2096400	I mean, this is like the vision camera.
2096400	2098400	Obviously, the vision camera is crap.
2098400	2100400	Obviously, the Kinect camera right now is crap.
2100400	2104400	So, yes, I expect SmartGlass to be kind of, eh, stupid.
2104400	2106400	All right, what would you want to say, Rama?
2106400	2111400	I said SmartGlass is nothing more than a fancy Wi-Fi remote for the 360.
2111400	2112400	That's all it is.
2113400	2115400	All right, well, before we get into that.
2115400	2118400	So, tablets, all it is is on life for the Wii.
2119400	2120400	Fair enough.
2120400	2123400	Well, not really. I mean, the big difference that you'll see with the Wii.
2123400	2125400	I think it's a huge difference too, but anyway.
2125400	2126400	It's low latency, that's all.
2126400	2128400	It's latency. It's low latency.
2129400	2131400	Anyhow, all right, let's talk about some of these other interviews.
2131400	2134400	Who else did you talk to while you were there at the show?
2134400	2139400	Well, while we were discussing the whole market share little quip,
2139400	2143400	we came across this one guy named Nick who does charity for one of his closest friends
2143400	2145400	because they were on the line for the Wii,
2145400	2148400	but unfortunately, his friend passed away from leukemia,
2148400	2151400	so they do a chocolate charity in his honor every year.
2151400	2154400	Oh, that's cool. I like that. Let's hear it from this guy.
2154400	2156400	We found this man. Your name again, sir?
2156400	2158400	My name is James Brief.
2158400	2165400	James, do you have any particular connection to the Wii and Wii launch dates?
2165400	2171400	Yeah, actually, my friends and I years ago were in the same line waiting for the Wii,
2171400	2177400	and one of our friends, Nicholas Capobianco, since then, he passed away from leukemia,
2177400	2181400	and every year since then, our friends, we get together like we did in the old days,
2181400	2185400	and we have a gaming marathon where we play games.
2185400	2191400	We can stream it live on the net at nixmarathon.org, and we raise money for Child's Play.
2191400	2195400	It's a charity that raises money for pediatric hospitals.
2195400	2201400	Very cool. Very reminiscent of Loading Ready Runs, Desert Bus for Hope.
2201400	2203400	So I think that's very cool.
2203400	2206400	Do you have any other comments about the Wii Wii U?
2206400	2208400	Oh, looking forward to it.
2208400	2211400	What do you think this is going to do to the GameCube's market share?
2211400	2214400	I think connectivity is on its way back.
2214400	2215400	Fabulous.
2215400	2217400	The connectivity is on its way back.
2217400	2220400	Well, that's a very noble cause. That's actually really awesome.
2220400	2224400	So props to that guy. That's great, and the group of friends that do that.
2224400	2228400	I hope if I inevitably leave this world too soon, you all will do something similar.
2228400	2229400	I think that's great.
2229400	2231400	You know we will, because we love you.
2231400	2232400	I'll totally show in your honor.
2232400	2234400	I'll totally start a charity to get me game systems.
2234400	2238400	Stop. All right. Moving on.
2238400	2240400	Who else did you guys talk to?
2240400	2244400	Well, the next clip I called Wii U Gives Grilled Cheese Sandwiches,
2244400	2250400	it seems that the staff was handing out drinks, food to everybody that's online.
2250400	2254400	So as we were interviewing this one parent that's on the line for Wii U,
2254400	2257400	staffer comes by, hands us grilled cheese sandwiches.
2257400	2259400	So we're like, why not? Let's roll with it.
2259400	2261400	Heck yeah. Let's hear this.
2261400	2263400	Hey, DJ Ron Mess here.
2263400	2266400	We are live, well sort of live, outside of Nintendo World
2266400	2271400	with the thousands and thousands of the Nintendo's fans.
2271400	2272400	Do you hear that?
2272400	2275400	These people are psyched for a Wii U and you know what?
2275400	2278400	The Wii U makes some real good grilled cheese sandwiches.
2278400	2280400	Look at that. Look at that.
2280400	2281400	Look at that.
2281400	2284400	The Wii U makes really good grilled cheese sandwiches.
2284400	2288400	Something that the PS3 could not do, that damn George Foreman grill.
2288400	2291400	Now we're talking to some people out here about their thoughts about the Wii U
2291400	2294400	and how long have you been on the line for this console?
2294400	2296400	Since about 2 o'clock this afternoon.
2296400	2300400	So you decided not to come out here like on a Monday or Tuesday and be like, I'm number one?
2300400	2303400	I did have to work, but you know, somebody has to pay for the Wii U.
2303400	2305400	True, but do you have kids?
2305400	2306400	Yes.
2306400	2308400	Did you think about sending the kids out here to hold the spot?
2308400	2310400	Somebody has to go to school.
2310400	2312400	Well, there's a will, there is a way.
2312400	2316400	So tell me, is this the first time you were online for a game or a console like this?
2316400	2317400	Yes.
2317400	2319400	Why are you out here for this?
2319400	2320400	Right here.
2320400	2323400	Actually, I just wanted to see how crowded it would be.
2323400	2326400	This is the best system.
2326400	2328400	And as you can see, it is very crowded.
2328400	2330400	It's just a thinned out version.
2330400	2333400	So as you know, Christmas is right around the corner,
2333400	2338400	so how much pressure are you under to get this console under the tree?
2338400	2340400	Oh, a lot of pressure, a lot of pressure.
2340400	2342400	I'm always under pressure every Christmas.
2342400	2344400	How'd you set it up today?
2344400	2345400	Today?
2345400	2348400	Yeah, I don't care if I get back at midnight, I don't care.
2348400	2350400	Well, I remember when the Super Nintendo came out,
2350400	2353400	I played it and I was told, pack it up, put it back in the box,
2353400	2355400	and put it back under the tree.
2355400	2357400	No, it will go back under the tree.
2357400	2358400	It will not.
2358400	2360400	What if you just wrapped the empty...
2360400	2361400	There you go.
2361400	2364400	Have you thought about just wrapping just the empty box under the tree?
2364400	2365400	It could work.
2365400	2367400	I think that would be a good thing.
2367400	2369400	So what games are you planning on getting out of here with?
2369400	2371400	Right now, just Nintendo Land.
2371400	2374400	I'm waiting for some of the other games to come out towards the end of this year.
2374400	2379400	I'm going to buy a new Super Mario Bros. 2, Zombie U, maybe a little later after launch.
2379400	2382400	Hey, that sounds like a plan, so thanks a lot for your time.
2382400	2383400	Thank you.
2383400	2384400	Arigato gozaimasu.
2384400	2385400	Datashimashite.
2385400	2387400	That was a very excited family.
2387400	2389400	Did I hear her right?
2389400	2391400	They set up the tree already?
2391400	2393400	The tree is set up around the corner.
2393400	2396400	The lighting ceremony is like sometimes this or next week.
2396400	2398400	Oh, the Rockefeller tree. Right, right, right.
2398400	2399400	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2399400	2400400	They usually do that over the Thanksgiving weekend.
2400400	2402400	All right, I gotcha. I gotcha.
2402400	2404400	All right, so what's this next one you got?
2404400	2408400	Well, Link was online, so I had to ask him, you know, what his thoughts were,
2408400	2412400	and did Zelda know that he left the castle?
2412400	2418400	Hey, DJ Ron Mess here at Rockefeller Center right in front of Nintendo World.
2418400	2422400	Take a look at that. That is an awesome view, ain't it?
2422400	2424400	Beautiful. Beautiful.
2424400	2426400	Right here, I'm chilling out with Link from Hyrule.
2426400	2428400	Link, what's going on, brother?
2428400	2431400	Just hanging out with my fellow diehard Nintendo fans
2431400	2434400	and enjoying the night and having a good time.
2434400	2436400	So what brings you here tonight, good friend?
2436400	2438400	Wii U, obviously.
2438400	2441400	What about the Wii U that you want so bad?
2441400	2445400	Because Nintendo, man. That's all I got to say.
2445400	2446400	Nintendo's the short answer.
2446400	2450400	The long answer is I'm really excited about the new innovation
2450400	2454400	that Nintendo's brought out with the new tablet controller.
2454400	2459400	They always set the bar with everything that they do every generation.
2459400	2462400	You know, they were the first for the joystick, the first for the shoulder buttons,
2462400	2464400	the first for the rumble feature, the first for the motion,
2464400	2467400	now they're the first for the touchscreen controller.
2467400	2470400	And that's just what they do, and they do it best.
2470400	2473400	Wow, this brother, he's diehard, really diehard.
2473400	2475400	So, Link, let me ask you.
2475400	2481400	If you're here online for the Wii U, who's watching Zelda?
2482400	2485400	That's an excellent question.
2485400	2489400	Here's the thing. Does she even know that you left the castle to be here?
2489400	2492400	No, I snuck out for a couple days, actually, yeah.
2492400	2498400	Well, I hope that Ganon doesn't try to roll up on your property, man.
2498400	2500400	She has Sheik watching her, so she'll be all right.
2500400	2503400	Sheik's a tough mother, you know.
2503400	2506400	So Sheik is watching Zelda.
2506400	2508400	Not Sheik, I'm sorry. Impa.
2509400	2511400	Because Zelda is Sheik, I made a mistake.
2511400	2512400	Impa's watching.
2512400	2514400	An old woman is watching Zelda?
2514400	2517400	Yeah, she's a Sheikah. She's tough.
2517400	2520400	Well, you can't beat that kind of logic, so thank you, good sir.
2520400	2521400	Thank you very much.
2521400	2522400	Yep, thank you very much.
2522400	2523400	Hey, no problem.
2523400	2526400	So, Loki, I know that guy, you know, at first I was like,
2526400	2529400	oh, he's just another kind of blind Nintendo fanboy.
2529400	2532400	However, he made a pretty damn good point.
2532400	2535400	Nintendo tends to set the bar with a lot of their shit.
2535400	2537400	I know you were sitting there going, joystick?
2537400	2539400	They didn't do the joystick, but they did.
2539400	2543400	You can say that Nintendo set the bar for the modern gamepad.
2543400	2545400	The Kinect would have never happened if it wasn't for the Wii.
2545400	2546400	Thoughts?
2546400	2548400	The Kinect would have happened.
2548400	2550400	I mean, it's camera technology.
2550400	2554400	The Kinect wouldn't have happened if the iToy hadn't happened.
2554400	2558400	Well, I just think that they should have stuck with the Coleco's model.
2558400	2562400	I miss my Intellivision pad.
2563400	2567400	Is the Coleco the one where you put the plastic stuff on the TV?
2567400	2568400	Or is it the fairchild?
2568400	2570400	No, you didn't put it on the TV.
2570400	2572400	You slid a little thing into the number pad.
2572400	2574400	What was the thing that you would actually have to put the overlays on the television?
2574400	2575400	Was that the fairchild?
2575400	2576400	Odyssey.
2576400	2577400	Odyssey, thank you.
2577400	2581400	Well, you know, actually the Odyssey 2 didn't have,
2581400	2584400	I had a couple games that used that, but not many that did.
2584400	2586400	Alright, we still have a few more interviews to go,
2586400	2588400	but you know I had to grill Loki on that.
2588400	2593400	Sounds like a lot of really great fans there at the event, right?
2593400	2596400	Oh yeah, especially the dancing Miis.
2596400	2598400	Oh god, really?
2598400	2599400	Yeah.
2599400	2601400	Alright, what's this next interview we got?
2601400	2602400	This is a quick one.
2602400	2605400	Well, I had ran off to do something and I came back.
2605400	2608400	Mario had picked up the microphone and started talking to people in the crowd,
2608400	2612400	and me as Luigi, I had some words for him.
2612400	2614400	So you were dressed as Black Luigi?
2614400	2615400	Yes, I was.
2615400	2617400	Alright, so this is Mario and Black Luigi. Here we go.
2617400	2620400	What am I doing in the commentary? What are you doing, Luigi?
2620400	2622400	I was also doing the commentary.
2622400	2625400	Why are you not in your mansion? You're going to get scared by the ghosts.
2625400	2628400	You should be off chasing after Peach again.
2628400	2632400	I need a break. I always chase after Peach. Peach never give me nothing.
2632400	2633400	I need a break.
2633400	2635400	So is that why she ran off with Bowser again?
2635400	2636400	Yeah.
2636400	2639400	Don't you go screwing this thing over. Bowser will take her heart.
2639400	2641400	She not take Bowser.
2641400	2643400	So how's that not my fault?
2643400	2645400	That's not your fault. You get out of here.
2645400	2646400	You get out of here.
2646400	2647400	Aww.
2650400	2653400	Rama, you know I love you. You're the biggest goddamn nerd.
2653400	2655400	Yes. Yes, I know.
2655400	2656400	Alright.
2656400	2657400	You too.
2657400	2658400	What's this next one?
2658400	2665400	This one was Taiki's idea of talking to Mario about the financial crisis in the Mushroom Kingdom.
2665400	2671400	I mean, just to give a quick recap. New Super Mario 2.
2671400	2674400	You have to collect the million coins to get the special statue.
2674400	2678400	My first thought is there's clearly a financial crisis in the Mushroom Kingdom.
2678400	2683400	Alright. Let's hear about that. Is the Mushroom Kingdom about to go off a fiscal cliff?
2683400	2684400	Uh, who knows?
2684400	2686400	Alright. Let's hear it.
2686400	2689400	What would the funny physics in the Mario...
2689400	2692400	Oh, sorry. I was playing the interview over you. Go ahead.
2692400	2696400	With the funny physics in the Mushroom Kingdom. I don't know if that's possible.
2696400	2699400	Alright. Let's hear the clip.
2699400	2702400	This is Taiki with a voice of Greeks.
2702400	2706400	And this is for special report. The financial crisis in the Mushroom Kingdom.
2706400	2711400	I have Mario here. Mario, I've been told you've been tasked to collect a million coins.
2711400	2715400	What are your thoughts on the current financial status in the Mushroom Kingdom?
2715400	2718400	Oh, it's very tough at times. Very tough at times indeed.
2718400	2723400	My new game, New Super Mario Bros. 2, is not about me fighting Bowser to fight the Princess Peach.
2723400	2728400	No. It's about me getting enough money so that Princess Peach can keep the castle.
2728400	2731400	Otherwise, no more castle. And for me, no more heroing.
2731400	2733400	No more heroing. No more games.
2733400	2735400	I need to get the coins.
2735400	2739400	Oh, it's a bigger problem. Aye, aye, aye, aye.
2739400	2743400	So the rumors that they are foreclosing on the castle at the Mushroom Kingdom is true.
2743400	2747400	What rumors? I don't hear nothing. I just have a peach.
2747400	2749400	Sir, you're avoiding the question.
2749400	2753400	What question? You look a lot like a Koopa.
2753400	2755400	What? I should stop you?
2755400	2758400	No. I'm just asking questions, sir. Just asking questions.
2758400	2765400	So what are your thoughts on the overabundance of S.T.A.R.S. and how that's affected the stock market?
2765400	2769400	Overabundance of S.T.A.R.S. makes Mario invincible.
2769400	2774400	Invincible Mario kick ass? What problem?
2774400	2778400	There's a massive price crash on S.T.A.R.S.
2778400	2781400	Oh, I see, I see.
2781400	2783400	Mario doesn't understand economics, does he?
2783400	2788400	Not very much, no. I stomp on the goombas, I kick at the Koopas.
2788400	2793400	I beat at the buzzer, I collect the coins, and I get nothing from a peach.
2793400	2795400	Not even cake?
2795400	2798400	Not even cake. Oh, woe isn't me.
2798400	2803400	And that was Taiki, voice of the geek network, signing off.
2803400	2808400	Who was that guy actually? Just like a die hard fan or what?
2808400	2810400	Pretty much.
2810400	2813400	Okay. A crazy person.
2813400	2815400	Crazy hobo.
2815400	2817400	Hobo with a shotgun?
2817400	2819400	I liked it.
2819400	2823400	Just saw him in the line getting interviewed by someone at Nintendo.
2823400	2830400	Okay. So did you guys get on some of the news stations dressed up or what happened?
2830400	2836400	Me, not really, because the only people I saw there was people from Nintendo, that was just about it.
2836400	2841400	But there was photographers and someone from Weekly Famitsu took my picture.
2841400	2843400	Oh, hey. Nice.
2843400	2845400	And Mashable was there as well.
2845400	2848400	Yeah, I was also speaking with some of the other press people there.
2848400	2854400	Yomiuri Shimbun was also there, a couple other press outlets were there too.
2854400	2857400	That's true. We do have to remember that we actually got the system before Japan.
2857400	2861400	This is one of those kind of, you know, it doesn't happen all the time, but kind of different.
2861400	2864400	Didn't it happen with the last Wii and the 3DS?
2864400	2868400	I guess it tends to happen more with Nintendo than does the other companies.
2868400	2872400	Because it seems like PlayStation and Vita and all that were out way earlier.
2872400	2874400	I know the Xbox is always coming out earlier over in Japan.
2874400	2877400	Well, Xbox makes a stud in Japan. All right.
2877400	2879400	Just they don't sell one for a few months.
2879400	2884400	Oh, whatever. All right. These last two interviews are some big ones.
2884400	2887400	So set this one up for us, Rama. What's next for us?
2887400	2894400	Well, at the front of the line was Triforce, who says he was there on the line for about a month.
2894400	2900400	And he has some bit of surprising news to let the fans know about him doing console launches.
2900400	2902400	Ooh, okay. Let's hear it.
2902400	2909400	Hey, DJ Varmus here in front of Nintendo World USA, where in just mere hours,
2909400	2913400	the new Wii U is going to hit the store shelves and take names and kick a lot of butt.
2914400	2917400	Now, as you can see behind me, there are die-hard fans out here.
2917400	2919400	How die-hard are you guys?
2922400	2923400	How long have you all been out here?
2925400	2930400	As you can see, but through the maze and through the vines, we're here with the one, the only, Triforce.
2930400	2932400	Good to meet you, sir.
2932400	2933400	What's going on, guys?
2933400	2937400	Not much. We do what we got to do. So tell me, how long have you been waiting out here?
2937400	2940400	Almost a month, since March 23.
2941400	2944400	I'm getting serious. Since March 23.
2946400	2949400	I'm still thinking about the 3DS since October 23.
2951400	2953400	October 23. Now, that's hard. That's dedication.
2955400	2957400	I tip my hat to you, good sir.
2958400	2963400	So, I do recall that you were somewhere else for the Wii, is that correct?
2963400	2967400	Yes, it was Toys R Us, and that was back in November. I can remember that date.
2967400	2971400	Oh yeah, we all remember that. So, why here instead of there?
2971400	2979400	First of all, this is my last launch that I'm going to be doing, and I took a guess.
2979400	2983400	I did some investigating, and I just felt that they were going to do the launch here.
2983400	2988400	See, that's where it is, because you know what? We talked to people about the Wii, and I kept telling everyone,
2988400	2991400	Nintendo World is the jump-off spot, because this is where the party is at.
2991400	2994400	So, how many of these launch events have you done?
2994400	2996400	This is my 8th and final one.
2996400	2998400	Why is it your final one, good sir?
2998400	3005400	I want to go and try to do some type of other marketing in the gaming community from the urban market,
3005400	3010400	you know, from the grassroots side, and although I do a lot of this,
3010400	3013400	I want to leave this for somebody else to do while I can help out elsewhere.
3013400	3020400	You know, I've done enough of it, and I'm 35 years old, so now's the time to stop.
3020400	3026400	That's not to say that I won't be at other launch parties, but the whole camping for the first, I'm going to stop it. This is it.
3026400	3033400	So, in other words, after this, someone else is going to inherit the Power Glove, like you now have the power.
3033400	3034400	Oh, they're going to fight you for it?
3034400	3039400	No, they're not getting that. They're just going to have to line up. That's it. I'm keeping the Power Glove.
3039400	3043400	Between you and me, I stomp somebody out for that to keep my Power Glove?
3043400	3045400	Well, that may happen, yeah.
3045400	3047400	So, what was your first launch?
3047400	3049400	The Nintendo DS.
3049400	3052400	And how was that compared to the launch for the Wii U?
3052400	3060400	Well, each year, Nintendo gets better with the launch. That was all the way back in 2004, and that was the first launch that I got first in.
3060400	3068400	My first ever launch was the Nintendo 64. I was the first in line, but that's what made me get into the whole launch thing.
3068400	3074400	Then after that, some unmentionables. I won't mention the name of the other competitors.
3074400	3076400	Oh, those guys.
3076400	3081400	Those guys, yeah. That's because I was working for GameStop, so I had to work the launch party.
3081400	3083400	So, it wasn't as fun?
3083400	3089400	No, I wouldn't say it wasn't as fun. I wasn't in the line for the launch. I just worked the launch party.
3089400	3094400	And then, the first launch party I became first for was the Nintendo DS.
3094400	3100400	That's wonderful. I can't believe you're doing this for so long. Eight launches, it all ends here.
3100400	3105400	So, if you're not here right now watching History in the Making, I don't know what to tell you. Peace out.
3106400	3111400	Leave me alone. I was asleep. No, that's crazy. That's his last launch.
3111400	3117400	It's interesting that he's kind of chalking it up to being 35 and all that, which is interesting because I'm kind of like,
3117400	3121400	well, I'm pretty much 35 and we're not ending OLR anytime soon.
3121400	3127400	But, I can also understand the whole like, okay, I don't need to be first anymore.
3127400	3132400	I don't have to be that guy anymore. I can let it go. I get that.
3132400	3139400	And he wants to kind of pursue the other stuff. That's certainly reasonable. So, you know, props to him for being so damn dedicated.
3139400	3144400	Yeah, it's like that line from Lethal Weapon, I'm getting too old for this shit.
3144400	3156400	Alright, we got one more interview from the event and dare I say, it's an Orange Lounge Radio VOG Network exclusive we're about to get.
3156400	3157400	Yes, we can.
3157400	3162400	Alright, and I've been teasing a little bit on Twitter that you had a pretty big interview.
3162400	3168400	But, it's short, but we wanted this to be special for the fans that actually bothered to tune in and listen tonight.
3168400	3171400	Rama, please set up this last interview.
3171400	3179400	Well, the man shows up and we all know who the man is, Reggie.
3179400	3184400	He's going through the crowd, doing autographs and saying hi to everyone.
3184400	3190400	And we catch him right before he goes inside Nintendo World and me and Taiki ask him a few couple of quick questions.
3190400	3197400	Okay, you're gonna have to set up the clip a little longer than that. The live listeners literally just got dropped.
3197400	3207400	Word must have gone up, but see, Rama, you're always the first to complain about the live stream going down and yet here we are still talking to each other. Isn't that funny?
3207400	3209400	I know.
3209400	3216400	Alright, with the apologies to the podcast listeners who are hearing this for the second time, Rama, go ahead and set it up one more time.
3216400	3226400	No problem. Well, the man of the hour, Reggie Fils-Aime, shows up and talks to the crowd in front of Nintendo World.
3226400	3236400	He's going through the crowd saying hi, doing autographs, and me and Taiki catch him right before he goes into Nintendo World and we shoot him about two or three questions.
3237400	3245400	Okay, this is gonna be really awkward, but the stream just went down again. We were up for like two seconds and then it went down.
3245400	3255400	I need you guys to kill all excess internet activity. I'm just saying, I need everybody across the board. Any chat, I need it all closed because this is killing the show with all these computers running.
3255400	3257400	So, alright.
3257400	3259400	Even my torrents of shiza porn?
3259400	3264400	Yeah, any torrents of that stuff, any dropbox that might be hiding in the background or whatever, it's gotta all go down.
3264400	3277400	So, okay. We are connected, here we go. Sorry, podcast listeners, I feel like Seacrest on American Idol, where it's like I'm drawing it out for like two minutes, the big interview, but please know it's for the live listeners' benefit.
3277400	3282400	Okay, I am showing and it's streaming again, so here we go. The big interview with Reggie.
3285400	3286400	That's good.
3286400	3287400	Absolutely.
3287400	3289400	Eric, how excited are you? How excited?
3289400	3290400	I'm very excited.
3290400	3292400	This is it, right?
3292400	3293400	This is it.
3293400	3296400	A new generation of gaming begins tonight.
3300400	3301400	What's your name?
3303400	3305400	Is that a British accent?
3305400	3306400	Yeah.
3306400	3308400	Came all the way from the UK just to be here?
3308400	3309400	No, actually.
3309400	3313400	No, come on, you could have played me. You said yes, came all the way here.
3320400	3322400	Reggie, small question.
3322400	3328400	A million coins in Newsroom Mario 2. Do you have any comments about the current economic crisis in Mushroom Kingdom?
3328400	3338400	You know, Mario's just trying to do his part. He's collecting coins. He'll go back and spend them someday, but he's trying to help out. There will be no fiscal cliff in the Mushroom Kingdom.
3338400	3339400	Thank you very much.
3339400	3340400	Thank you.
3342400	3343400	Did you get it?
3343400	3347400	All right, so you have the chance to ask Reggie one thing.
3351400	3357400	And you chose to ask him how he feels about the fiscal cliff in the Mushroom Kingdom.
3358400	3365400	But you gotta admit that he actually picked up on it and rolled with it. You got to give the man credit for that.
3366400	3373400	Orange Lounge Radio exclusive, everybody. Reggie comments on the fiscal cliff in the Mushroom Kingdom.
3374400	3381400	I mean, that's pretty cool and all. It's almost as good as me asking, you know, what Jason Enos about in the group.
3381400	3389400	But I'm sure asking them about the financial crisis in a fictional video game is fucking awesome. That's great use of time.
3390400	3394400	Well, I mean, he's going to get into the media and he's going to answer all these questions about whatever.
3394400	3395400	There needs to be a bumper.
3396400	3402400	To be fair, it will be a bumper, but to be fair, Loki, you know damn well it doesn't matter what they ask.
3402400	3409400	They would have got the same canned answer for anything. So for them to throw him a curveball, I say you guys are the biggest fucking nerds.
3409400	3411400	And I so appreciate that about you.
3412400	3413400	Thank you.
3415400	3422400	I think that was brilliant. I would rather have had that than the canned response, because if we want the canned response, we can look at press releases.
3422400	3425400	Yes, you press them for word. Yeah, whatever.
3426400	3429400	And the whole five seconds before he goes, I got to go inside. Bye.
3430400	3431400	Yeah, Loki's jealous he wasn't there. All right.
3432400	3437400	And we're not 20 20. So it's a little bit differently. And also, you could think Taiki. That was his idea. All right.
3438400	3439400	That went over damned well.
3440400	3445400	Well, you both contributed a lot to that segment, and I really appreciate you guys sharing that with OLR first.
3446400	3451400	I know you could have held on to that for AJS, but I really appreciate that VOG podcast sticking together.
3452400	3453400	It's awesome.
3453400	3454400	Hey, that's what we're here for.
3455400	3458400	Plus the band has one of the official VOG sheets.
3459400	3464400	Nice. Very nice. Well, we're an hour into the show. We haven't even got to our gaming weeks yet.
3465400	3468400	So I'm probably going to wrap this up so we can move on. But you have anything else you guys want to get out?
3469400	3472400	Taiki, great job. Anything you want to get out here before we let you go?
3473400	3476400	Can I talk about the issue of Quebec independence?
3477400	3478400	If you want.
3478400	3479400	Independence for Quebec now.
3480400	3481400	Viva Quebec!
3482400	3483400	Rama, anything you want to get out?
3484400	3490400	I think I should save it for calling back later. It has something to do with we use and shame stop.
3491400	3495400	Oh boy. All right. Well, hopefully talk to you later. Hopefully we don't run too long tonight. I can take a lot of calls. All right.
3496400	3496400	
3497400	3498400	Take care, buddy. And thanks, guys.
3499400	3499400	
3500400	3505400	You can hear Anime Jam Session Tuesdays at vognetwork.com, 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern.
3506400	3514400	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, bronze.
3515400	3521400	Big thanks to them for being out there, even though their questions were a little bit lullsy. You know what? I'll take it.
3522400	3529400	All right. Moving on. Let's get to our video game weeks. And how was our gaming week? It's only an hour into the show.
3530400	3535400	Loki! How you doing? Oh, wait. I always start with Jamie. How you doing? How was your gaming week?
3536400	3537400	I already know what she's going to say.
3538400	3539400	It was sweet.
3540400	3541400	Yeah. What's that?
3542400	3549400	I played and beat Sugar Rush on the Wreck-It Ralph website. It's fucking fun. It needs to be like a for reals game.
3550400	3556400	I mean, and I was actually really surprised by how long it was because, I mean, I was playing for a few solid hours.
3556400	3563400	It's like you have four stages with three races in each stage. And like the first two, I think, are two laps.
3564400	3569400	And then the third one is three laps. And then the last one's three laps. And it's much, much longer and complex.
3570400	3577400	And I mean, it's like a stupid little kart racer, but it was really fun. And I've decided that Rancis is the best name ever.
3578400	3583400	And my first born, if I have one, will be Rancis. Rancis Flubber Buffer, whatever his name is.
3583400	3593400	The one with the Reese's cup on his head. And then I played a bunch of Mass Effect 2. I played a bunch of it today.
3594400	3604400	And then I actually did a whole bunch of design work, but my design work had me going and pulling samples off of old video game packaging because I wanted certain colors.
3604400	3612400	Like I pulled the gold off the Nintendo cartridge, off of the Zelda cartridge, because I wanted that particular shade.
3613400	3620400	Because it's like when you sample part of it, it comes out kind of this muted brown. And that was the color I wanted.
3621400	3628400	And I was like, what do I know that reflects that color? So I was sampling NES cartridges to get the right shade of brown off of a gold Zelda cartridge.
3628400	3629400	Very cool.
3630400	3637400	And I actually logged into WoW just because I don't want to get kicked out of the guild. I hate to say that.
3638400	3649400	But I mean, I'm trying to build myself back up into actually wanting to level my troll. It's just, no one plays on Blade's Edge anymore and that's the only character I really care about is my main on there.
3650400	3656400	Ragenator at live.vognetwork.com expressing surprise. DarkSakura won't name her first born, Garrus. WTF.
3656400	3662400	No. Rancis. No. Actually, I'm probably never going to have a kid, so it doesn't matter.
3663400	3668400	No, I'm serious. At this point, I'm perfectly content with it. All you people who have kids, good luck.
3669400	3672400	You know what, you will have a new kitty to name someday. It's a very similar dilemma.
3673400	3681400	I need a cat in my life right now. But Dan's like, we have to buy a house first. So I'm like, well fine, if I can buy a house so I can get a cat.
3682400	3685400	For the cat, because the cat needs the house. It won't be your house, it'll be the cat's house.
3686400	3690400	I decided that when I get a cat, it's going to be named Mochi. I don't care, my cat will be named Mochi.
3691400	3693400	That's a good name. Alright, anything else for your gaming week?
3694400	3696400	Um, um, cooking with dog.
3697400	3704400	Okay, no, because I've been going in between playing Mass Effect 2, pausing my game, making Udon because I'm also watching cooking with dog.
3705400	3711400	And then going back and playing more Mass Effect, that's been my cycle. Mass Effect, cooking with dog, cooking. Mass Effect, cooking with dog, cooking.
3712400	3714400	Loki, how was your gaming week?
3714400	3725400	I played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, Call of Duty Black Ops 2 because I'm really getting into the single player campaign, tried some more of the multiplayer, just kind of some system link stuff at work.
3726400	3730400	The rest, we should be getting copies for everybody this week so we can play some of that.
3731400	3737400	And so far, I've loved every minute of it and it hasn't let me down at all, so I'm looking forward to that.
3739400	3742400	And I think I fit in a little bit of Minecraft this week as well.
3744400	3746400	That's pretty much it.
3747400	3750400	Jason, how about you? It's been a while since we've seen you last. What's been going on in your gaming world?
3751400	3759400	Well, for that time frame, no, not that whole time frame. I've actually been out here for work for a week at this point, just over a week.
3760400	3766400	So the literal week has been rather light because I've been having exciting San Francisco, California fun times.
3766400	3775400	But there is a setup at the office and the office favorite is FIFA 13, so I've been thoroughly trashed at that game, both by the computer and by my co-workers.
3776400	3778400	Is that the one that they're hazing for being just like FIFA 12?
3779400	3780400	Isn't that all sports games in this generation?
3781400	3782400	That's on the Wii.
3783400	3785400	I mean, like, for real, it is a carbon copy. Like, I'm not, like, no jet.
3786400	3787400	And Pro Evo are both carbon copies.
3787400	3795400	The last time I was out here, they did have FIFA 12 in the game. The only notable difference I've noticed is that they give you more interactivity during the loading screen.
3796400	3801400	But I completely admit that's completely superficial because I start a multiplayer game and go with it.
3802400	3807400	And I can't really comment to single player, you know, GM, those kind of bonus modes, anything like that. I couldn't say at all.
3808400	3818400	They did also get Halo 4 and I started a campaign by myself on, I think the tier is easy, normal, legendary, heroic, and I'm on legendary because I thought I could keep up.
3819400	3820400	No.
3821400	3822400	Oh, Dan made that mistake.
3823400	3829400	No, it might be passable with help, you know, a multiplayer legendary campaign, but me by myself, I'm still in Chapter 1.
3830400	3838400	And I gave up after playing the same checkpoint, just passed the same checkpoint about 30, 40 times, maybe more, I'm not entirely sure.
3839400	3841400	I suck at Halo and I'm very, very sad at this fact.
3844400	3851400	Otherwise, yeah, that's really it. I'm still nursing Borderlands 2 since I've been traveling quite a bit over these past two months.
3852400	3856400	And not really sit down and play meaningful games time lately, unfortunately.
3857400	3858400	Alrighty.
3859400	3865400	Most of my week, I already talked about with the Wii U launch, so in the interest of time, I'm not going to repeat myself, but I will talk about just quickly.
3866400	3872400	Played a little bit of Mass Effect 3 because we tried to set it up so that we have two TVs and two Xbox 360s here at the house.
3873400	3877400	So Alan and I were like, can we play multiplayer with each other, even though we only have one copy of the game?
3878400	3881400	And we figured out, yes, we can, because all of multiplayer is on both discs.
3881400	3883400	So we put one disc in one and one in the other.
3884400	3895400	And how we got around the online pass is I had Alan play on my usual Xbox and I played on the other one because when you have licensed content on the 360, it's licensed to the original console and your ID.
3896400	3904400	So we made it work and we played and Alan decided he hated it because having to go from keyboard and mouse to controller, apparently not a good fit.
3905400	3914400	I also played some Halo 4, finished the first five episodes of Spartan Ops playing with a friend. I think we actually did six.
3915400	3917400	So that was cool. Halo, good times.
3918400	3919400	Emphasis on with a friend.
3920400	3925400	Yes, and I think Spartan Ops we did normal. We're not too crazy now.
3925400	3934400	All right. Some housekeeping for you guys. Please remember, you can follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch radio, as well as Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R.
3935400	3937400	Meanwhile, let's get into some news.
3938400	3941400	And a quick thank you to everybody voting in the podcast awards, which are now closed.
3942400	3948400	Thank you very much. Absolutely. Yes. Thank you to everybody who voted for us in the podcast awards. And if you didn't, I hope you kept it indie.
3949400	3950400	I forgot one more game.
3951400	3952400	Oh, hurry. Very solid here.
3952400	3960400	Oh, I played that too, thanks to that tip last week. It's cute. Yeah, it's free. I can't complain. Better than Yaris.
3961400	3963400	All right. Let's get into some news, Loki.
3964400	3968400	Rob, having your head drilled open with your brains falling out is better than Yaris.
3969400	3973400	All right. So there was a, there was a system that launched today, the Wii U.
3974400	3975400	Really? I hadn't heard.
3976400	3981400	I can see how you can be confused. It is very similar to the previous generation.
3983400	3987400	You may, you may have been confused and bought another Wii, so you better double check that.
3988400	3989400	So this one's black.
3990400	3991400	They do make black Wiis now.
3994400	4003400	So, let's see. You know, you know the difference between the Wii U and the Wiis. The Wii has functioning online right now. That's pretty sad.
4004400	4012400	All right. So the Wii they claim is going to be in larger supply, probably due to less demand, but it is going to be easily more available.
4013400	4024400	They're not going to make their artificial shortage as big this time around, but he says basically their second and, you know, third, fourth replenishments are going to be more frequent holiday time.
4025400	4031400	And, you know, you'll be able to get a Wii system or Wii U system before, you know, next year or next holiday, I guess.
4033400	4034400	Which is good, I suppose.
4037400	4043400	Unfortunately, like with most Nintendo console launches of recent, it is missing a few things.
4044400	4054400	And the first being Nintendo's highly, you know, advertised and pimped out TV service, which was supposed to be launching with the console.
4054400	4057400	But, you know, it's not done, so it's going to be launching in December.
4058400	4064400	And until then, you're at the way to watch, you know, live TV through this or, you know, your on-demand stuff, Netflix, etc.
4065400	4069400	So it'll be coming in the next few weeks unless they delay it again because, you know, something they do.
4070400	4077400	And then also, of course, you know, fun. Yeah, I'm kidding. It's a fun console. It's an easy joke to make.
4078400	4079400	Yeah, it's a fun console.
4079400	4090400	And I'm sure that everybody was really happy, you know, that waited in line to get their Wii U system to get home and download your 5GB firmware update, which is fantastic.
4091400	4096400	And, of course, this would also encompass, you know, the Miiverse stuff as well.
4097400	4106400	It's funny, though, because apparently there's some people that were having issues with it downloading so slow that they thought their console was not working, so they shut it off.
4106400	4109400	Not a good idea. And now their console doesn't work.
4110400	4121400	But, yes, 5GB. So if you're thinking about it, if you've got that non-black system, you have less than half of that storage space left for stuff.
4122400	4132400	Obviously, you're not going to put an actual game on there because there's no room for it, but you're not going to be able to fit, you know, you're going to basically need to get an external storage device, which is kind of...
4132400	4140400	You kind of would have had to anyways, but still. It's not as bad. Remember when the Xbox 360 came out and everyone's like,
4141400	4148400	Oh, hey, the 20GB hard drive. What? 7GB of this is just, you know, the backwards compatibility data.
4149400	4155400	This is almost as bad, except I didn't have to wait an hour for the backwards compatibility data to exist on that hard drive.
4156400	4163400	And, of course, you know, with any network launch, this would be for MMOs and stuff, they've been having a little bit of issues.
4164400	4173400	It's been kind of up and down, probably because of the high traffic, but thankfully it is back up. Fantastic.
4174400	4183400	It worked fine for me, for what it's worth. To be fair, it did take an hour, but I expect that 5GB is going to take an hour to download, but it did work fine, and I haven't really had connectivity problems.
4184400	4193400	Well, Wii video chat was a little bumpy. We got some weird error messages that weren't even true, because we were able to connect fine. It was weird.
4194400	4198400	Warning, the person on the other end does not exist. Not quite that, but yeah.
4199400	4207400	Oh. So, there's your Wii U launch. Get excited! I'm thrilled.
4207400	4217400	Alright. Well, not too thrilled is this guy. He got caught by the police. Justin Success Brooks. Yes, his name was Success Brooks.
4218400	4228400	Well, unfortunately, he wasn't very successful in his business of selling counterfeit Nintendo games in the UK, because he got caught and sentenced to 32 months of jail time.
4228400	4236400	He was actually selling counterfeited games. He was working with some dealers in China through 18 different websites.
4237400	4247400	Nintendo had warned. The UK border agency had warned. He had his stock seized at one point. However, he continued to sell the games through a different website, so it was kind of one of those.
4247400	4258400	They weren't going to keep him out any other way, so they officially sentenced him to 32 months, although even in the UK, you don't really end up serving the entire time. He'll probably only be serving about half of it.
4259400	4272400	What's interesting, Francesca Levitt, who is one of the prosecutors on this case, claiming the victim is not really Nintendo, but legitimate online game retailers who have to compete with counterfeit sellers.
4272400	4281400	Quote, Nintendo may be big enough to weather the storm, but the damage this has done to the reputation of online retailers is untold and incalculable. That's in a statement to The Guardian.
4282400	4304400	I would take that down one more notch, that not so much Evil G and those others, but people who do use game stores or import game stores or the people who really try to carve out their niche, that oh yeah, they also sell big retail titles, mainstream titles, because you don't survive as a business any other way.
4304400	4315400	I think it is a good reminder that this kind of stuff doesn't just hurt Nintendo, it hurts everybody in the chain, from developers and makers to the people that sell them.
4316400	4317400	It hurts my feelings.
4317400	4318400	And Jamie's feelings.
4318400	4320400	And it gives Reggie hemorrhoids.
4320400	4321400	What?
4321400	4323400	Because he's all butthurt.
4323400	4327400	Oh, I see. Alright, let's move on with another story, Darzaka.
4327400	4331400	Okay, well, who likes Pokemans?
4331400	4333400	Who doesn't like Pokemans?
4334400	4337400	Of course, Loki raised his hand.
4337400	4349400	Well, actually Nintendo is doing Poke Deck IOS, which is their first paid app in the Apple Store. Of course, it's only out in Japan right now.
4349400	4361400	And it covers everything up through black and white, and it's 170 yen, which is about £1.30, so I guess here it would be maybe a $3 download.
4363400	4372400	There's also extra packs with other monsters that go up to 500 yen, so yeah, you could pay a lot of money for it.
4372400	4383400	But now there's still a free app that's the Pokemon Say Tap that was out for a little bit last year, but for right now this is their first paid app.
4384400	4403400	I have to say that, and some of it may be the language, and I know that interfaces do vary highly in between languages, but this Pokedex IOS looks kind of as crap as Pokedex 3D on the 3DS Store. I never liked it.
4403400	4414400	It may also be that I've kind of abandoned ship as far as Pokemon is concerned, and I haven't played it recently enough, so none of the creatures were familiar, but this doesn't hit me.
4414400	4417400	I heard that this thing is full of in-game purchases too.
4417400	4423400	Oh yeah, that's what I was saying. There's four extra packs, and they're 500 yen total.
4423400	4424400	They ain't free.
4424400	4427400	No, I mean, you roughly end up paying about seven bucks.
4427400	4428400	Wow.
4428400	4435400	Six or seven. I'm trying to do a little bit of conversion here, but yeah, you end up paying more like about six bucks.
4435400	4444400	So, Loki, you gotta be excited about this. It's Nintendo on an Apple product full of microtransactions. This is like made for you.
4444400	4451400	It sounds like just any other app on the IOS Apple Store or whatever.
4452400	4457400	I think it's just, what's interesting is it's not a knockoff for once.
4457400	4470400	This is true. And plus the whole, oh my gosh, it's something Nintendo on Apple, but you know, before the emails correcting us come in, we should say there's a very different relationship when it comes to the Pokemon company.
4470400	4478400	Because they, even though Nintendo somewhat controls them at the end of the day, if the Pokemon company wants to do something different, they can.
4478400	4485400	And so for them to be the ones dipping their big toe in with this IOS app is not, it's not too surprising.
4485400	4492400	And it could be interesting because if this does very well, which, who knows, maybe that will cause Nintendo? I don't know.
4492400	4502400	But then again, Nintendo's always been very much, no, ever since the CDI, never again will our characters be on another console.
4502400	4507400	Alright, moving on.
4507400	4516400	Alright, so let's talk a little bit about non-Nintendo stuff. Let's talk about Microsoft.
4516400	4521400	And of course they were celebrating the 10 year anniversary of Xbox Live.
4521400	4533400	And with that they were giving out some fancy Xbox Live 10 year anniversary themed Xbox 360s to people that had been on live for those 10 years.
4533400	4538400	Of course certain people didn't get them. Like Bobby.
4538400	4541400	Sorry Bobby.
4541400	4544400	But there's some, you know, some random users were getting them.
4545400	4552400	I don't think every 10 year user got one. You probably got entered into a drawing or something behind the scenes and they gave away like 100 of them or something.
4552400	4556400	Yeah, they never really explained it. It doesn't really make any sense to me that they would give you a console.
4556400	4562400	I mean that's kind of cool that you get a console, but wouldn't you already have a console if you're on Xbox Live? It's like hooray!
4562400	4568400	All the people that won it are the people that have lived through about 5 or 6 Red Rings and E74s.
4568400	4572400	So the next time it invariably happens to their next one, they have a replacement already.
4573400	4575400	And it looks pretty cool actually.
4577400	4579400	It's neat I guess.
4580400	4588400	So yeah, so some of you who may have been on there for 10 years will maybe be getting an email or something saying hey you got a 360 coming your way.
4588400	4595400	You probably would have already got that email or you got the email that I got that says congrats, here's your code for an avatar helmet.
4595400	4598400	I got an email and two messages.
4599400	4602400	Take the fucking helmet, Loki. Take it.
4602400	4604400	I don't want the helmet. I'm not wearing the helmet.
4604400	4607400	No, take it. Here's another message. Here's another code. Take the damn helmet.
4607400	4609400	It puts the helmet on its avatar.
4612400	4614400	Nice.
4614400	4622400	Alright, speaking of Microsoft, this is interesting because we know the PlayStation Magazine is stopping, the Nintendo Power is stopping.
4622400	4626400	Well, Xbox World is also going to cease publishing in December.
4626400	4632400	But this is what's interesting. This is one over in the UK and the last issue is going out with a bang.
4632400	4641400	Details on the next Xbox which they say is going the way of Apple and is going to be called simply Xbox.
4643400	4646400	Loki is shaking his head. What?
4646400	4647400	This is dumb.
4647400	4652400	And Sony's brand new TV called TV, it's called the new TV.
4653400	4659400	Thank you for not making it fucking confusing. We're just going to call it something else anyways.
4659400	4664400	That's just basically saying, hey, you know what, we just didn't want to market a name that people are going to make fun of.
4664400	4668400	We're just going to market a name that we already had that people can make fun of or something.
4668400	4675400	To be fair, it's rumor. We don't know. But anyway, 8 gigs of RAM, quad core processor, it will run Blu-ray discs.
4675400	4683400	Supposedly going to have in the future like some type of future add-on would be a head-mounted augmented reality device.
4683400	4688400	And there will also be a next generation Kinect which I think we all see as kind of a duh.
4688400	4693400	Anyhow, in a statement, Xbox World editor-in-chief Dan Dawkins said,
4693400	4698400	Xbox World has been at the cutting edge of Durango coverage for over 12 months.
4698400	4706400	Unless something really dramatic changes, everything we reveal in our penultimate issue will be revealed long before E3 in June.
4706400	4709400	That was in an interview with CVG overseas.
4709400	4714400	So basically they just recap the original leaked rumor thing that, you know.
4714400	4722400	Yeah, there really isn't a lot here new that wasn't in the rumor except the part about the name and the augmented reality we've sort of heard in different forms.
4722400	4729400	Because we've talked about that whole projection on the walls. I'm not hearing that here. I'm hearing it's glasses instead.
4729400	4731400	It's not going to be glasses.
4731400	4732400	You don't think, huh?
4732400	4733400	No.
4733400	4739400	That would, you'd get into a lot of accessibility issues with glasses. That's why the projection thing made more sense.
4739400	4742400	That's why 3D TVs aren't popular because you have to buy the glasses.
4742400	4743400	That's a good point.
4743400	4748400	And it's just, I don't know. It's just, no.
4749400	4757400	WhatupG in chat says, at live.vognetwork.com says, next E3 is supposed to be the coming out party for the PS4 slash 720.
4757400	4759400	You know, that's the assumption we're all making.
4759400	4763400	And it sounds like, at least in Microsoft's case, that'll be true.
4763400	4767400	But why is this necessarily true for Sony?
4767400	4772400	Is there any indication that Sony is really going to debut this or is this wishful thinking on the community's part?
4772400	4776400	I think it's all wishful thinking. I don't think anyone's going to debut a system next year.
4776400	4778400	Oh, you think Microsoft's going to hold off too?
4778400	4784400	I think that the Wii is not going to do as well. It's not going to take over like the Xbox 360 and the PS3.
4784400	4788400	So they're just like, eh, why do we have to hurry? There's really no hurry.
4788400	4794400	Yeah, but the 360 was out before the Wii. So it would not be uncharacteristic of Microsoft to launch.
4794400	4797400	Right about now is a good, you know, life cycle for them and it makes sense.
4797400	4802400	Especially if they, quote unquote, beat Sony by a year. Sony's later in the... Sony's...
4802400	4807400	I guess. I mean, if you look at what they have slated so far, what Microsoft has announced,
4807400	4812400	they only have first quarter next year that's been announced, or even the first half of next year.
4812400	4817400	And Sony's kind of similar. They've got a few things that they've announced.
4817400	4822400	They've got about three or four titles. Those could all be first half of next year, but they haven't really...
4822400	4826400	I mean, it's a little early to announce the second half because you want to have something for E3 now.
4826400	4834400	You think the last Office and the... what's that other big one? The one that keeps disappearing at various E3s?
4834400	4835400	The Last Guardian?
4835400	4840400	Last Guardian, thank you. There's no way in hell Last Guardian's out before next holiday.
4840400	4847400	And then on top of that, you still have whatever happened to 13 versus, question mark. We don't know where that is.
4847400	4848400	Who cares?
4848400	4849400	I mean, that's third party.
4849400	4850400	But who cares?
4850400	4858400	A lot of Final Fantasy fans care. And, like it or not, 14 reborn. That ain't happening until at least summer next year.
4858400	4864400	So we know there is stuff on the calendar up to the holiday, at least in Sony's department.
4864400	4866400	So, that's interesting.
4866400	4870400	Well, I mean, that's not Sony necessarily. That's third party companies.
4870400	4874400	And obviously you're going to have third parties putting out titles.
4875400	4883400	Well, that's early part next year. But you still have stuff coming out for a while on there because not everyone is going to pick up.
4883400	4889400	It's just like the Wii. The Wii is still going to have some stuff coming out. Not anything from Nintendo, but they're going to have a few things.
4889400	4894400	Interesting comment from Tigerclaw in the chat room. What about the Ouya? You would also have to deal with that when it comes out.
4894400	4902400	Well, the Ouya is kind of its own little thing. I don't think any of the other guys are taking the Ouya seriously because the Ouya is such a grassroots homebrew thing.
4902400	4908400	It's like, oh, that little basement, that kid's basement toy. I honestly think that's how they view it.
4908400	4914400	Because what's the Ouya going to do for the gaming experience? Is it really going to push the gaming experience further?
4914400	4919400	No, it's just going to open up. It's going to be the most indie friendly thing you've ever seen.
4919400	4925400	It's just going to be kind of similar to how Steam, because it's kind of the way Steam is trying to go too.
4925400	4929400	They have the whole Steam Greenlight stuff to try and get your indie games on their marketplace.
4929400	4934400	And then Steam Big Picture. So they kind of want to sell you a box, which they may eventually do.
4934400	4940400	They will eventually sell you a box that you hook up to your TV and you just get all the Steam stuff with a controller and away you go.
4940400	4943400	Which would be fantastic. I don't have a problem with that.
4943400	4950400	But I think Ouya is trying to do something similar to that where they have got the box that they sell you, which is really tiny, which is awesome.
4950400	4956400	And then of course all these games are going to be kind of exclusive to it because they're mobile games for the most part.
4957400	4965400	And you'll just have to see how it takes off. I don't think it's going to be huge. It's not going to all of a sudden just take over the Wii or anything like that.
4965400	4966400	It's not going to happen.
4966400	4971400	It'll be like a Roku. A lot of people have them, but not everybody is talking about them.
4971400	4981400	Unless, and it's obviously the Wii U doesn't have anything like this, but let's just say that one day they decide,
4981400	4987400	hey, you know what, we're going to make it so all these games that you buy from us, you can't trade them in anymore.
4987400	4992400	Or in the next consoles that come out, hey, by the way, all these games are going to be tied to your console.
4992400	4994400	Then something like that may be able to take off.
4994400	4999400	I'm seeing on Twitter that your Nintendo network ID is tied to that console. You can't move it.
4999400	5007400	Now, I'm seeing a lot of rage on Twitter about that. I kind of think that's that whole, we just haven't built how to move it yet.
5008400	5013400	I'm giving Nintendo the benefit of the doubt that they just haven't freaking built that in yet.
5013400	5018400	Once again, reiterating what we've been saying for months now, they don't fucking get online.
5018400	5022400	They have something that resembles online right now, but they still don't fucking understand it.
5022400	5025400	They're making it up as they go along.
5025400	5033400	That's a real bad, I mean, come on, this is how late into the game are we getting into like an actual functioning online?
5033400	5039400	And you still haven't figured, I mean, this is this is shit that they were, you know, fucking up years ago.
5039400	5044400	And now they're just, it's amateur shit.
5044400	5048400	All right. Dark Soccer, what do you have for us before we get to release dates?
5048400	5054400	I have stuff and things. So I'm sure people were interested in Black Ops 2.
5054400	5058400	Although when one of my friends posted about it as B02, I was like, body odor 2?
5058400	5063400	Because it's really about as much as I care about Black Ops, but they did something really awesomely stupid.
5063400	5072400	On the installation disk, it has the data for Mass Effect 2 on it instead.
5072400	5076400	So they're getting a much better game.
5076400	5080400	But that means that they can't install Black Ops 2 with the disks.
5080400	5087400	And they've, but the retail copies come with the Steam key and you can do a digital install and it takes longer.
5087400	5089400	But you know what?
5089400	5097400	Now, I heard something, and I don't know if this ended up being true or not, but I heard something about that this was being caused because these people actually...
5097400	5099400	Oh, it's PC copies, by the way.
5099400	5109400	Yeah, these people already had Mass Effect 2 installed on their PCs and Mass Effect 2 had the lock on some type of file extension that Call of Duty was also, or Black Ops was also trying to use.
5109400	5113400	And so when Black Ops would call up the file, Mass Effect was loading.
5113400	5117400	Like, it seems like it's only happening to people that already had Mass Effect 2.
5117400	5121400	At least that's what I'm hearing. I don't know if that panned out or whatever, but I know that was something they were exploring.
5121400	5124400	Well, it says it happened specifically with the second installation disk.
5124400	5125400	That's weird.
5125400	5135400	Yeah. So, and it's like people on Steam, Reddit, 4chan, although no one listens to 4chan anymore, and the Black Ops forums were complaining about it.
5135400	5145400	It can also be a pressing issue. They're all duplicated at a few duplicators, and if it just happens that they're pressing copies of Mass Effect 2 and some of those happen to get in there.
5145400	5147400	But Activision hasn't said shit about it, so...
5147400	5152400	Well, which is funny, yeah, because that would mean Activision and EA are using the same presser.
5152400	5159400	Yeah, they do. I mean, Technicolor, they press disks for the movie industry, for everything.
5159400	5172400	Yeah, there's only a few duplicators that are out there, and aside from Nintendo actually doing carts and stuff, but these all get duplicated at a few duplicators around the world, and it's just whoever they decide to use.
5172400	5179400	So yes, it's very possible that they get stuff that maybe another company is using.
5179400	5185400	Alright, let's travel around the world and look at release dates and see what's coming to a game store near you this week.
5186400	5190400	Alright, this week we've got, it's starting to slow down a little bit, so we've got a few things.
5190400	5203400	Rise of the Guardians coming out on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, the Wii, the DS, the 3DS, and yeah.
5203400	5210400	And then the 3DS version of Pro Evo Soccer 2013, although I think that date's wrong. I believe that's actually coming out next year, if I remember correctly.
5210400	5217400	Adventure time! Hey Ice King, why'd you steal our garbage? On 3DS and DS, also collector's editions for those.
5217400	5229400	Hitman Absolution on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Persona 4 Golden on the Vita, PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale on the PS3 and the Vita.
5230400	5239400	Also, let's see what else we got here. That is definitely a wrong date. Man, they really need to update their goddamn website.
5239400	5249400	The Elder Scrolls, let's see, oh and that's not coming out. What else we got here?
5249400	5261400	Alright, and let's see, we've got Scribblenauts Unlimited on PC, and the PC version came out a little bit later, and everything else.
5261400	5274400	And Family Guy, Back to the Multiverse on PS3 and 360, and Kids Learn and Play Pets and Vets. I think that's a re-release.
5274400	5276400	The thermometer goes in the butt.
5277400	5288400	And Assassin's Creed III on PC. What the hell is this, Kids Learn and Play? It's like a bundle, but I haven't ever seen these.
5288400	5293400	It's some value game. It's crap, don't buy it.
5294400	5302400	That in-depth review brought to you by Loki. Alright, let's go to the Japanese release dates and what's coming out over there.
5302400	5312400	On November 22nd on the Xbox 360, Doom 3, the BFG edition, as well as Call of Duty Black Ops 2, this is the version with subtitles, is released in Japan.
5312400	5318400	There's also an Xbox Live special membership card to celebrate the Call of Duty release in Japan.
5318400	5325400	On the PlayStation 3, Call of Duty Black Ops 2 is out there as well, same with Doom 3. There's some more stuff though as well.
5325400	5332400	Some games getting price reductions, Grand Theft Auto 4, Infamous 2, Killzone 3, LittleBigPlanet 2, all of them getting price reductions.
5332400	5339400	As far as new games go on the PlayStation 3, Mina No Golf 6, EX Troopers, Chaos Head,
5339400	5340400	That's everybody's golf.
5340400	5347400	Chaos Head Love Choo Choo, and Chaos Head Noah, as well as a double pack of both games are out there as well.
5347400	5356400	And Tehayo no Arashi Senkan Yamato Akatsuki ni Shutsugiketsu comes out.
5356400	5361400	You know what that is? Space Battleship Yamato? In other words, Star Blazers?
5361400	5366400	Oh, luxury limited edition and regular edition in Japan this week.
5366400	5375400	And a classic white slim console comes out if you need to get your Japanese PlayStation 3.
5375400	5378400	Looking at the other systems real quick, let me check on the Vita.
5378400	5384400	There's just another 3G Wi-Fi pack out this week that has Mina No Golf 6 with it.
5384400	5386400	So, there's that, yay.
5386400	5390400	On the 3DS, EX Troopers is out there as well.
5390400	5397400	On the 23rd, Pokemon Fushigi no Dungeon, I'm assuming that's the Pokemon Dungeon Crawler game.
5397400	5399400	Fushigi is mysterious.
5399400	5403400	Oh, I keep wanting to say Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon, but it's a Pokemon game.
5403400	5404400	Pokemon Mysterious Dungeon.
5404400	5406400	Pikachu's Mysterious Dungeon or whatever.
5408400	5415400	Ochi Manichi Tamagotchi on the 3DS, because Tamagotchi, yes, is still a thing, believe it or not.
5415400	5420400	You know, I saw Furbies at Toys R Us the other day, so what's old is new again.
5420400	5422400	I blocked Furby on Facebook.
5422400	5428400	Now, the Wii U, keep in mind, not out over there in Japan until December the 8th,
5428400	5433400	so we don't have those release dates for a little bit, but we'll work those into the rotation soon.
5433400	5437400	Otherwise, we'll go to Jamie for what's coming out in the UK.
5437400	5439400	Some stuff at the end. No, I'm kidding.
5439400	5447400	On the 18th, Epic Mickey 2, Power of Illusion, and the Power of 2, U-Draw Studio.
5447400	5451400	On the 20th, we have Hitman Absolution, Planetside, next.
5451400	5454400	21st, The Walking Dead Episode 5, no time left.
5454400	5461400	23rd, Assassin's Creed 3, Rise of the Guardians, Talisman Prologue.
5461400	5463400	And that's it.
5463400	5468400	All right, just a few more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.
5468400	5470400	And I think we've got some Sony news.
5470400	5473400	We've talked Nintendo, we've talked Microsoft, but Loki?
5473400	5478400	Yeah, they announced already that PlayStation Plus would be coming to the Vita,
5478400	5481400	and they've now announced which day it's going to be coming out.
5481400	5483400	It's going to be coming out tomorrow, November 19th.
5483400	5487400	And what's kind of awesome with that is they're also adding some games to the Instant Game collection
5487400	5489400	that will be available for the Vita.
5489400	5495400	And this includes some full Vita games, including Uncharted Golden Abyss,
5495400	5499400	Jet Set Radio, which is actually set to come out next week,
5499400	5505400	Wipeout 2048, Gravity Rush, Tales from Space, Mutant Blobs Attack,
5505400	5510400	and I guess Final Fantasy Tactics, The War of Lions, that was a PSP title.
5510400	5513400	And not bad.
5513400	5516400	And of course, PlayStation Plus, 18 bucks for three months,
5516400	5519400	or 50 bucks for the full year.
5519400	5523400	And I guess obviously if you have a PlayStation Plus membership,
5523400	5528400	you also get all the free wonderful games library stuff with the PS3,
5528400	5532400	and the one gigabyte of cloud storage, which is pretty awesome.
5532400	5534400	And I guess a gigabyte of cloud storage on the Vita.
5534400	5536400	I wonder if that's the same one gigabyte.
5536400	5539400	Is your Vita actually going to come out of storage now at this point?
5539400	5541400	Well, it's in my backpack.
5541400	5543400	Is it going to come out of your backpack?
5543400	5547400	No, because I have to actually become a member of PlayStation Plus,
5547400	5549400	and I just don't want to right now.
5549400	5552400	I'm excited. I'm PlayStation Plus, and I couldn't be more excited about this.
5552400	5555400	I'm like, oh my god, it's like Christmas on my Vita tomorrow.
5555400	5558400	It's going to be great. So yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
5558400	5560400	Vita's relevance is finally starting to come out.
5560400	5561400	Hooray!
5561400	5563400	Just in time for the holidays.
5563400	5565400	All right, well, also coming to the Vita,
5565400	5569400	I think this is also tomorrow with the PlayStation Plus update,
5569400	5575400	obviously a whole new firmware 2.0, a new email application for the Vita.
5575400	5578400	It's kind of interesting, but well, it makes the 3G a little more lucrative,
5578400	5580400	especially if you don't have a phone that does it.
5580400	5584400	With the coolest PlayStation's typing interface.
5584400	5588400	I get what they're doing, but no.
5588400	5591400	It's easier to use than iPhone, honestly. I think so.
5591400	5593400	On the Vita? Heck yeah.
5593400	5599400	It's easier to have the key directly instead of having to memorize what it's under.
5599400	5602400	The Vita has that tanky style mode.
5602400	5608400	You can type on the keyboard, and it's really responsive and fits a large part of the screen.
5608400	5609400	Oh, the Vita is a touch screen, isn't it?
5609400	5610400	Hello!
5610400	5611400	Okay, disregard, sorry.
5611400	5614400	You're thinking about Sony's PlayStation 3 predictive text,
5614400	5617400	which the Vita will do as well, so it has that.
5617400	5619400	I'll be over here if you need me.
5619400	5628400	That's alright. Gmail, Yahoo, and other miscellaneous providers unsaid will be supported.
5628400	5631400	Also, finally, this is so dumb that they didn't have this before.
5631400	5635400	Wirelessly transmit between the PC and the Vita.
5635400	5639400	Also, browser and video apps will now do 1080p videos,
5639400	5642400	even though it's not like it's going to magically change the output.
5642400	5645400	What about wirelessly transmitting between the PS3 and the Vita?
5645400	5650400	That's not said, but I would think if it's wireless between the PC, why not?
5650400	5652400	Yeah, I think it would be on the PlayStation 3.
5652400	5655400	I want to say I read that somewhere else, that it will do that too.
5655400	5656400	Thank God.
5656400	5658400	It makes so much more sense.
5658400	5660400	So, very cool.
5660400	5663400	That's all coming as well this week.
5663400	5666400	Alright, let's go back to a time when games were a lot simpler,
5666400	5668400	and you didn't have all this firmware.
5668400	5670400	You got your cartridge, and you liked it.
5670400	5672400	That was firmware.
5672400	5675400	You dropped it, and it still worked. That was firmware.
5675400	5680400	You flushed a cartridge in the toilet, and it still worked.
5680400	5686400	It is the classic game of the week, and I believe Dark Sakura is taking it back this week.
5686400	5687400	I am.
5687400	5692400	The game of the week is Yars' Revenge for the Atari 2600.
5692400	5695400	Yars, not Yaris.
5695400	5697400	This is a great pick, just so you know.
5697400	5703400	It's also a game that particularly illustrates the proper way to use an apostrophe with something that ends in an S.
5703400	5709400	Although, to be honest, if they were ever going to make a second Yars game, Yars' Revenge would be kind of funny.
5709400	5714400	It would be like Christine, you know, words that end with an S.
5714400	5716400	Anyway.
5716400	5725400	Anyway, it came out in 1982, and it was created by Howard Scott Warshall, who wrote Raiders of the Lost Ark and E.T.
5725400	5727400	But we forgive him because of Yars' Revenge.
5727400	5731400	That's right. For every bad game he made, there was a good game.
5731400	5734400	And let's not forget, he was under tremendous pressure with E.T.
5734400	5737400	Read his side of it. You'll feel a lot of sympathy for the guy.
5737400	5742400	Which isn't that like the plot of the Angry Video Game Nerds movie now?
5742400	5745400	Trying to find where all the cartridges of E.T. are?
5745400	5747400	Who cares? I care about the real story. No offense.
5748400	5752400	Well, anyway, it was supposed to be a licensed port of the game called Star Castle.
5752400	5757400	Which, there's a cannon that's protected by these counter-rotating shields.
5757400	5761400	And you have to shoot holes in the shields to destroy the cannon inside.
5761400	5764400	But then again, once you shoot the holes, the cannon can shoot you.
5764400	5766400	So, um...
5766400	5768400	Kill or be killed.
5768400	5770400	Anyway.
5770400	5775400	So, as they were developing the Atari version, it actually changed quite a bit.
5775400	5781400	So now your hero is called a Yar, which is like a little insect thing that nibbles through the lair.
5781400	5787400	And then it can shoot his cannon into the breach and kill the evil Kotyle.
5787400	5789400	Which I think is how it was said.
5789400	5791400	Um, who was on the side of the barrier.
5791400	5796400	Although you can be shot at through the barrier.
5796400	5798400	And, uh...
5798400	5800400	And it, uh...
5800400	5802400	And it turns into a swirl.
5802400	5805400	However, you're warned before you get shot at.
5805400	5808400	And you can go back to the other side of the little energy wall.
5808400	5813400	Which, I swear the first time I saw that I was like, is my TV fucked up?
5813400	5815400	But no. It's a party game.
5815400	5817400	Um, it's also a little safe zone.
5817400	5819400	The neutral zone.
5819400	5821400	Um, the swirls can get you, but the little torpedoes cannot.
5821400	5824400	And you cannot shoot from within the neutral zone.
5824400	5827400	So, um, you've got different scoring.
5828400	5835400	And if you, like, the highest thing you can get is if you shoot one of those swirls in mid-air with the Zorlon cannon.
5835400	5837400	Which is this little shooty thing.
5837400	5842400	You get 6,000 points and an extra life that you can get only up to nine lives.
5842400	5847400	And each level ends, um, when you kill the Kotyle or the swirl.
5847400	5853400	So, uh, basically when you reach 70,000 points the shield will turn blue.
5853400	5856400	And the swirls come out with more frequency.
5856400	5859400	If you get 150,000, the shield turns gray.
5859400	5862400	And, you know, even more crap comes up.
5862400	5864400	And you get a guided missile.
5864400	5865400	It's gonna get ya.
5865400	5873400	230,000 points, the shield turns pink, and the swirls will begin to fire three, um, times more frequently.
5873400	5875400	And not give you warnings.
5875400	5877400	There was a comic book that came out with it.
5877400	5881400	Had a mini comic book, um, that, uh, was at the game package.
5881400	5890400	And it gave the story behind the game and why it was seeking vengeance because apparently the thingy blew up their world.
5890400	5896400	And then there was an album that had a theme song and a radio drama of the comic book.
5896400	5898400	So that was kind of neat.
5898400	5907400	There's also an easter egg in the game that if you kill a swirl in mid-air, a black vertical line appears on the screen across the spot where the swirl was shot.
5907400	5913400	And the line is referred to in the manual as Ghost of Yars and warns the player to stay off the mean streak.
5913400	5920400	If the player moves vertically along that line and is about one to two inches below the middle of the screen when the explosion closes,
5920400	5928400	the game will end and go into a game select screen with the programmer's initials HSW, um, that's forward and backwards on the word select.
5928400	5934400	Um, if you do it in game six or seven, JOV appears, which is under the player's initials.
5934400	5939400	There's a remake, um, for the, uh, Game Boy Color in 1999.
5939400	5943400	In 2005, of course, it came out on the Atari Flashback II.
5943400	5946400	There's a three in one that came on the GBA in 2005.
5946400	5949400	And, um, that also came with Pong and Asteroids.
5949400	5952400	It's available in Game Room in 2010.
5952400	5955400	There's a reimagining that came out on Xbox Live Arcade.
5955400	5962400	Um, and, uh, actually I think it's not out yet on PS3. They said they were gonna be doing it.
5962400	5965400	I don't know if it ever did come out on PS3. I don't remember.
5965400	5969400	I checked it out on 360 and I was like, it is nothing like this.
5969400	5972400	Well, now the Yar is a chick with power armor.
5972400	5982400	And then there's another remake that's a prequel that's called Yar's Revenge First War that, um, was part of the Atari Go deal on April 8th, 2011 on Facebook.
5982400	5987400	And, uh, it's supposed to be a lot more like the 2600 game. I haven't played it.
5987400	5993400	And there's another one that's free on browsers that supports HTML5 that is on Atari.com.
5993400	5995400	There's other classic Atari games.
5995400	6000400	And, um, there's a sequel called Yar's Return that's on the Atari Flashback II.
6000400	6002400	The end.
6002400	6006400	There it is, your classic game of the week. A real classic going way back to the Atari 2600.
6006400	6011400	Yar's Revenge. Undoubtedly one of the best 2600 games they ever did.
6011400	6012400	Absolutely.
6012400	6015400	Alright, well we are going to take a break, guys, when we come back.
6015400	6019400	We've got more of Orange Lounge Radio to come, including rapid fire, uh, news.
6019400	6022400	The Fubo Question of the Week, uh, some other gaming related news.
6022400	6029400	And a hilarious follow up to something I said next week, or I said last week, would probably not go away.
6029400	6030400	The Futures!
6030400	6033400	It's really funny. We'll get to that in just a little bit.
6033400	6036400	When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6043400	6046400	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
6046400	6053400	Live with episode number 482 of our show for this November the 18th of 2012.
6053400	6057400	We're going to get into some rapid fire news, but first, I gotta ask Loki.
6057400	6062400	Loki's over there. He's like, alright, let me touch the Wii U tablet.
6062400	6064400	He's gonna touch the Wii.
6064400	6066400	Alright, alright, Loki, touch the Wii U tablet.
6066400	6074400	I, I like it. I think it has a good, for such a big frickin' thing, it's, it's got a really nice feel to it.
6074400	6082400	It's, I mean, as far as the placements of the analog sticks, they're comfortable, but hitting, like, the buttons below it is not quite comfortable.
6082400	6094400	It, like, if you're trying to hit the A, like, the A button, if there was a game that you were using, you know, like, first person shooters and stuff, where the A button might be used, that is a bit, you know, that could cramp up your hand pretty bad.
6094400	6107400	You know what's strange about that is that from that, that's, I felt that, wow, words, yes, I felt that in the menus that, and I think this might be more related to the Xbox 360 controller since they just flipped where the buttons are.
6107400	6114400	I kinda noticed that problem in the menus, but the little, the couple of games that I was playing through didn't really have finger placement issues.
6114400	6116400	I don't know.
6116400	6128400	Well, if you wanna follow me on Miiverse, again, I said this quickly here in the first part of the show, but if you did pick up a Wii U and you wanna follow me on Miiverse, my name on the Wii, really creative, y'all, Rob Roberts, all one word.
6128400	6130400	I know, really tough to figure out.
6130400	6139400	Alright, let's, uh, travel, uh, through some rapid fire news and talk quickly about what else is going on in the gaming world, not just a Wii.
6140400	6149400	There's StarCraft II, Heart of the Swarm, which is the next expansion for StarCraft II, and it should be coming out March 12th.
6149400	6155400	It was originally kind of alluded to or leaked out on Battle.net, and of course, they confirmed.
6155400	6157400	That'll be out March 12th.
6157400	6168400	It'll be released individually at $39.99, and of course, Digital Deluxe and Collector's Edition version will be available as well, priced at $59.99 and $79.99 respectively.
6169400	6180400	And the Digital Deluxe version, like anything else that is Blizzard, will contain stuff that, you know, doesn't necessarily apply to the game that you're buying, which doesn't make any fucking sense to me.
6180400	6188400	You get a pet for World of Warcraft and a new sigil for Diablo III, and, um, and yeah.
6188400	6196400	Why, someone explain this to me, why the fuck would I buy a Collector's Edition for one game to get shit for another game? That doesn't make any goddamn sense.
6196400	6199400	Because you're already playing the other game, especially WoW.
6199400	6209400	There's a lot of Blizzard crossover in the fandom. I would say there's more synergy within that fandom than almost any other type of company, with the exception of maybe Squeenix.
6209400	6210400	And you actually can-
6210400	6212400	Before pre-IDOS.
6212400	6214400	And you can get StarCraft pets in WoW.
6214400	6220400	Yeah, there's a lot of that crossover, but sigils, really, really-
6220400	6222400	That's a bit of a stretch.
6222400	6223400	Really.
6223400	6225400	But what else are they gonna give you, a friggin' legendary drop?
6225400	6237400	I don't know, I mean, it's just kinda dumb that they have that. Behind the scenes DVD slash Blu-Ray, and a soundtrack, also a Heart of the Swarm hardcover art book, and a Zerg Rush mousepad.
6237400	6238400	Key, key, key, key, key.
6238400	6250400	Let me put it this way, okay? Rational people out there, just don't fucking buy the Collector's Edition. You don't need to spend $40 extra for a pet in WoW and a goddamn mousepad.
6251400	6257400	It's not, just, resist. You can do it. I mean, seriously, it's just kinda-
6257400	6260400	But if you are an addict and bought it, give me the pet.
6260400	6265400	I would be glad to give you mine, because otherwise the code will be completely unredeemed.
6265400	6266400	Okay.
6266400	6269400	Do you have the one from the original StarCraft II release?
6269400	6270400	No, I do not.
6270400	6272400	Okay, I will send that your way when I get home.
6272400	6275400	Yes! So I win, I win, Rob, you can't have it.
6275400	6278400	Sorry, you're making food and not in the room. Disqualified.
6279400	6284400	So PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale comes out next week, and they've already announced their first bit of DLC.
6284400	6291400	What? Early DLC? What the fuck? Why? I'm not paying for DLC. Well, good, you don't have to, because it's actually free.
6291400	6305400	And the two characters they're going to be adding to the roster include Kat, who is from Gravity Rush, the Vita game, and I guess Emmett Graves, who is the character from Starhawk.
6305400	6312400	And what's kind of cool is apparently the unique gameplay styles from both of those games are going to cross over into it,
6312400	6326400	including Kat's ability to manipulate gravity and Emmett's ability to kind of call the support stuff from Starhawk, the build-as-you-kind-of-go type thing.
6326400	6332400	So that's pretty neat, and free DLC is always awesome, and it's kind of cool to see if they're going to be expanding this game.
6333400	6341400	Maybe when the Game of the Year edition comes out with all the characters in there, they may consider picking it up, but still pretty neat.
6341400	6349400	And last but not least, and I've actually used this company before, Fingerprints is actually doing something now with Minecraft,
6349400	6359400	where you can actually export a part of your world and have it printed in 3D. That's right, your own Minecraft world creations in 3D.
6359400	6371400	And you just have to download the app that's on the Fingerprints website, just fingerprints.com slash Minecraft, and you can go check it out.
6371400	6380400	And I guess the prices vary depending on the size of your model that you're having printed, and they kind of give some examples, and they're pretty cool looking.
6380400	6392400	I had gotten one from my Xbox 360 avatar, so I actually have a 3D avatar of myself at my desk, which is pretty awesome.
6392400	6399400	But yeah, it doesn't really say how much it would cost for your creations.
6399400	6405400	There would be some cool stuff I'd want to make from our world, but I have to see how much this is.
6405400	6414400	Looks like it may only be one chunk. I'm thinking it might be one chunk, but neat! Kind of cool.
6414400	6426400	Looks cool. Moving on, Classic Dragon Quest fans will rejoice in the news that the Heartbeat Studio that originally developed the games in the Super Nintendo and PS1 games,
6426400	6432400	that closed shortly thereafter, is up for a revival as the Genius Sonority.
6432400	6438400	They previously worked on Pokemon Colosseum, Dragon Quest Swords, and the Dinpamen, they came by wave.
6438400	6447400	Manaba Yamana revealed by Twitter that Heartbeat will be relaunched after a decade, starting early next year with a new business perspective.
6447400	6453400	According to Inside Games, Yamana said to expect a new webpage with more information next year.
6453400	6457400	Can only imagine what their debut title is going to be.
6458400	6467400	Origin has been hit by a series of security breaches as users come to find out their accounts have been cracked and personal details have been leaked.
6467400	6473400	Sigh. To make matters worse, EA's own security measures ensure victims aren't resolving the issue.
6473400	6481400	Because it's so unable to log back in, change your email address back, change your password, certain things along those lines.
6481400	6486400	Users affected by the attack are told that their email address is invalid whenever they try to log in,
6486400	6493400	and as soon as they call EA to find out what's wrong, they get shut down by representatives who can't help them without a receipt and valid date of birth.
6493400	6496400	S.M.H.
6496400	6500400	Yes, with a valid date of birth, the course is being changed by said hacker.
6500400	6508400	Because, you know, that has to be something that'll change, because you will mysteriously be born at a different date than you once were.
6508400	6510400	God bless web development.
6510400	6516400	NeoGaf has managed to compile tens of thousands of threads, well that wouldn't surprise me,
6516400	6524400	ten threads of complaints on EA's official forums and just a sample of the overall total of grief being expunged on the internet.
6524400	6532400	If you use Origin, do your due diligence, unique password, make sure all your stuff is correct so you at least have a remote chance of getting back into your account.
6532400	6534400	Be internet safe.
6534400	6541400	Since you brought up NeoGaf, I don't visit that site an awful lot because it's a little too busy and I have too much, like, ADD,
6541400	6547400	but there was, like, the most winning thread I've ever seen on a web forum was on NeoGaf this week,
6547400	6556400	and it had to do with photoshopping your favorite, or no, a descriptive, animated gif as the box art for a game.
6556400	6562400	Like, I'm describing this and I'm doing a terrible job, but like there was this great, like somebody photoshopped a box art for Tokyo Jungle,
6562400	6567400	and it was like these two kiddies in a dog hall wrestling, and it was really funny, like there was all this kind of stuff.
6567400	6575400	Grand Theft Auto 5 with a cop taking some guy out, it's like all these great animated gifs from around the internet on video game box art.
6575400	6579400	That's absolutely nothing to do with what you just talked about, but I like gifs.
6579400	6581400	Who doesn't?
6581400	6585400	And two days ago was officially Miyamoto's 60th birthday.
6585400	6588400	Not too much need to be said for a man like him.
6588400	6599400	Imagine how the state of games would be different had Shigeru Miyamoto and Nintendo and the entire uprising that has happened on the last three decades not actually occurred.
6599400	6602400	Uprising? Bad choice of words.
6602400	6604400	Up checking.
6604400	6608400	In some cases, like, the value Wii games, I suppose.
6608400	6610400	How about Oother News?
6610400	6611400	Oother News?
6611400	6618400	Tom Hardy is going to be playing the lead in Splinter Cell for the movie version, Sam Fisher.
6618400	6619400	Good.
6619400	6627400	However, he's also slated to join Michael Fassbender in an Assassin's Creed film, so.
6627400	6631400	Also, God, as if this wasn't enough.
6631400	6634400	Who remembers Barkley Shut Up and Jam?
6634400	6643400	Well, the group that did Barkley Shut Up and Jam Gaiden, the sequel that was all completely parody, have a new Kickstarter up to make a game called
6643400	6653400	Magical Realms of Tyran Anog, Escape from Necron 7, Revenge of Cocolon, the official game of the movie chapter 2 of the Hoops Barkley saga.
6653400	6654400	That's awesome.
6654400	6657400	And then Jet Set Radio Vita will be out November 20th.
6657400	6663400	And a mobile version will be out in 90s after for iOS and Android. The end.
6663400	6666400	Let's get to the foogle question of the week.
6673400	6677400	Take Facebook and Google Plus. Yes, people are on Google Plus.
6677400	6679400	And slam them together and you get foogle.
6679400	6682400	Make them do it. Make them have retarded babies.
6683400	6686400	What? Foogle.
6686400	6688400	Foogle. Go foogle yourself.
6688400	6695400	Alright, every week we ask a question on our foogle communities and we get answers.
6695400	6698400	And we read some of our favorite answers on the show.
6698400	6704400	We have a lot of responses this week because I actually planned ahead this week and asked the question a whole day early.
6704400	6707400	So you're very welcome that we get more participation this week.
6707400	6714400	Very controversial article going around the internet this week because, you know, how else do you get hits for your website?
6714400	6715400	Stir up some controversy.
6715400	6720400	Like determining the all time 100 best video games.
6720400	6726400	Now usually I wouldn't give two shits about a list like this because everybody's got one on their site, whatever.
6726400	6728400	But it's Time Magazine's website.
6728400	6733400	And so I go, okay, well Time Magazine, that's a magazine that's been around, you know, a little while.
6733400	6737400	And has a big reputation as like a news magazine.
6737400	6740400	It's in every dentist's office in the country. You've seen Time Magazine at some point.
6740400	6745400	So they put up their list of the all time best of the best 100 video games.
6745400	6748400	Now I don't have time to read the entire list here.
6748400	6752400	But just to give you an idea of some of the things they named.
6752400	6755400	The Oregon Trail was on there.
6755400	6758400	Mass Effect 3 was on there.
6758400	6760400	Yay!
6761400	6768400	When I looked at the list, I saw it as a little more like, these are influential games.
6768400	6773400	Not necessarily the best games, but games that like were felt.
6773400	6778400	And there's only two games from this decade on the entire list.
6778400	6780400	From the 2010s.
6780400	6782400	Mass Effect 3 and Batman Arkham City.
6782400	6784400	Which, well, Batman Arkham City was a pretty fucking great game too.
6784400	6786400	Bad citizens are both pretty worthy.
6786400	6788400	Both pretty worthy.
6788400	6790400	The oldest games on the list from the 1970s.
6790400	6792400	The Oregon Trail.
6792400	6794400	Hunt the Wumpus.
6794400	6796400	Does anyone remember that? I actually remember the Wumpus game.
6796400	6798400	Pong.
6798400	6800400	Breakout.
6800400	6802400	Space Invaders.
6802400	6804400	Adventure.
6804400	6806400	And Asteroids.
6806400	6808400	But some people are having issues with this list.
6808400	6810400	Because they only would do one game from a series.
6810400	6814400	So I think they did the original Zelda.
6814400	6816400	The original Mega Man.
6816400	6820400	They did Metroid, but not like any of the follow-up games.
6820400	6822400	No Guardian Legend.
6822400	6824400	They did Final Fantasy VII, and yes, no Guardian Legend.
6824400	6826400	Bastards!
6826400	6828400	They picked VII, that is amazing justification.
6828400	6830400	I can see, I can see.
6830400	6834400	Well look, we asked you guys on Google Plus and on Facebook.
6834400	6836400	We're sure many of you saw this list.
6836400	6838400	What was your impression of the list?
6838400	6844400	Being that time is more of a news organization than something that typically caters to entertainment.
6844400	6846400	Were there any glaring omissions or issues?
6846400	6850400	So here's some of the answers from Google Plus.
6850400	6852400	Kevin R. replied and said,
6852400	6856400	I think Wii Sports should not be on this list.
6856400	6860400	What about cult followings like Disgaea and .hack and Persona?
6860400	6864400	Let's see some that are not for the mainstream.
6864400	6868400	Kevin, I'm totally with you on the second half, but Wii Sports not being on the list?
6868400	6870400	Well here's the thing.
6870400	6874400	The fact that it's Time magazine is why Wii Sports is on the list.
6874400	6876400	This was not EGM or some like game.
6876400	6882400	You have to remember, Wii Sports broke the mainstream in a way very few video games have.
6882400	6884400	It is the top selling video game ever.
6884400	6886400	Am I not right?
6886400	6888400	100% agree.
6888400	6892400	Very unfortunate for us and what we do, our feelings and what we say, but
6892400	6896400	Wii Sports is the number one reason why, as you said before,
6897400	6900400	the Wii was such a runaway sale, period.
6900400	6906400	But I get it. I'm not here to argue with listeners who are commenting on Google for the first time.
6906400	6908400	I'm not doing that.
6908400	6910400	But I'm just saying, think about it this way.
6910400	6912400	Because even though as a gamer you might be like,
6912400	6915400	there really isn't much of a game here. I'm just flailing about here.
6915400	6917400	Only Wii bowling counts.
6917400	6920400	That flailing sold a hell of a lot of systems.
6921400	6923400	Elliot B says,
6934400	6936400	You know, Portal 2 I'll give you.
6936400	6938400	Minecraft, vomit.
6938400	6940400	Until someone buys me a copy.
6940400	6944400	I'm sorry, but your opinion doesn't count on Minecraft.
6944400	6948400	I know that sounds harsh, but I'm sorry.
6948400	6950400	Here's the thing I do want to say to be fair.
6950400	6952400	Portal 1 is on the list.
6952400	6954400	And so they did the whole No Sequels thing.
6954400	6958400	So I'm okay with Portal 1 topping Portal 2.
6958400	6960400	Minecraft.
6960400	6964400	I think that's one of those, let it age like a wine.
6964400	6966400	I think in five more years,
6966400	6971400	I think we haven't really felt Minecraft's influence yet.
6971400	6974400	Batman Arkham City and Minecraft 3,
6974400	6980400	Mass Effect 3, were final games in long running series.
6980400	6982400	Or the latest games in long running series.
6982400	6984400	They had a little different battle to that list.
6984400	6986400	So, hmm.
6986400	6988400	Let's see.
6988400	6990400	Robert G picked up on something.
6990400	6993400	It was a good list, but it had some editing problems.
6993400	6997400	Atari's adventure screenshot was not from the actual game.
6997400	6999400	I have to see if that is...
7001400	7003400	Is that not from the game?
7003400	7005400	I'm trying to look at it.
7005400	7007400	I guess maybe not.
7007400	7009400	It looks like a game screenshot,
7009400	7011400	but I'm thinking, when do you take the red dragon there?
7011400	7013400	Weren't they all in front of little castles?
7013400	7015400	Or could you move them around?
7015400	7017400	I think someone Googled that and said,
7017400	7019400	let's use this one.
7019400	7021400	Probably.
7021400	7023400	It could have been a hacked image or something like that.
7023400	7025400	Maybe.
7025400	7027400	We could have found a better one.
7027400	7029400	It's like when you go to the movie
7029400	7031400	and the trailer isn't in the movie.
7031400	7033400	Which happens all the time.
7033400	7035400	It happens all the time now.
7035400	7037400	That was a big thing in TV commercials for a while, too.
7037400	7039400	Yeah, TV commercials for shows.
7039400	7041400	All the time.
7041400	7043400	That was some of the answers from Google+.
7043400	7045400	I'm sorry I didn't read them all,
7045400	7047400	but there's some good stuff there,
7047400	7049400	so I hope you will check them out.
7049400	7051400	Let me read some of the answers from Facebook.
7051400	7053400	Critical Myth, also on the VOG Network,
7053400	7055400	replies, starting off,
7055400	7057400	it was a nice walk through gaming nostalgia,
7057400	7059400	could possibly take our subjective likes and dislikes
7059400	7061400	and personal histories into account
7061400	7063400	to match our expectations or preferences.
7063400	7065400	A very good reminder.
7065400	7067400	But hey,
7067400	7069400	we still have to argue about it anyway, right?
7069400	7071400	Tiara,
7071400	7073400	our good buddy Tiara from Geek-Life.com
7073400	7075400	replies and says,
7075400	7077400	don't get me wrong,
7077400	7079400	Final Fantasy Tactics is one of my favorite games,
7079400	7081400	but how did that make it on the list?
7081400	7083400	But Final Fantasy IV and VI didn't.
7083400	7085400	Overall, a lot of good choices,
7085400	7087400	but some questionable ones as well.
7087400	7089400	Well, Tiara, I'm pretty sure IV and VI
7089400	7091400	didn't make the list because VII did.
7091400	7093400	And now we're gonna go back
7093400	7095400	and have that old argument
7095400	7097400	about Final Fantasy VII,
7097400	7099400	so I'll just let that be.
7099400	7101400	Interesting that they did jump.
7101400	7103400	Not that the Final Fantasy universe
7103400	7105400	was canonical
7105400	7107400	from release to release,
7107400	7109400	but interesting that they would jump out to Tactics
7109400	7111400	in addition to VII.
7111400	7113400	Tactics, though, is a completely
7113400	7115400	different type of game.
7115400	7117400	And I think the argument I was going for
7117400	7119400	would be like
7119400	7121400	modern Mega Man games,
7121400	7123400	like Battle Network, not that I would put them
7123400	7125400	in a candidate for top 100, but just saying
7125400	7127400	the fact that there are a lot of Mega Man spinoffs
7127400	7129400	with completely different play style and whatnot.
7129400	7131400	How many other RTSs are in there?
7131400	7133400	Like, did they do Breath of Fire?
7133400	7135400	It's a big list.
7135400	7137400	It's a page list.
7137400	7139400	Well, I have a quesadilla in my mouth.
7139400	7141400	I'm just using it as an example.
7141400	7143400	Did they do Tactics Ogre,
7143400	7145400	or anything that was that same style
7145400	7147400	of gameplay?
7147400	7149400	Final Fantasy Tactics really, I think, took out
7149400	7151400	something that was an
7151400	7153400	almost niche,
7153400	7155400	just slightly outside the niche level,
7155400	7157400	and really brought it into
7157400	7159400	mainstream, because it was a big
7159400	7161400	name that everyone recognized.
7161400	7163400	I'm scanning this list real quick
7163400	7165400	trying to look for tactical games.
7165400	7167400	Desktop Tower Defense,
7167400	7169400	I don't even know what that game is.
7169400	7171400	That would be tactical.
7171400	7173400	It's Tower Defense.
7173400	7175400	That's about all you have to say.
7175400	7177400	Well, but
7177400	7179400	look at all the fucking Tower Defense games
7179400	7181400	we have now. That's a huge part of IOS.
7181400	7183400	No, I agree with it on the list.
7183400	7185400	I'm saying the genre.
7185400	7187400	How dare you disagree?
7187400	7189400	Not
7189400	7191400	a lot of other tactical games on the list.
7191400	7193400	I don't see a lot of those
7193400	7195400	other games you were mentioning.
7195400	7197400	I definitely agree with Jamie's point,
7197400	7199400	that Goful World with a Great Story
7199400	7201400	gave it a similar enough
7201400	7203400	engine, and it is one of the only
7203400	7205400	strategy games to hit as wide adoption
7205400	7207400	as it did.
7207400	7209400	Let's see, some of the other answers from
7209400	7211400	Facebook. Daniel S.
7211400	7213400	replied and said, yeah, didn't bother with the list.
7213400	7215400	They're just bait for more
7215400	7217400	page clicks. Check out IGN's
7217400	7219400	Top 100 RPGs list.
7219400	7221400	They put Persona 4 at number 90.
7221400	7223400	I stopped reading lists after that.
7223400	7225400	While I don't totally disagree with you,
7225400	7227400	one reason I picked this list in particular
7227400	7229400	is that it is Time magazine.
7229400	7231400	It's not a video game site.
7231400	7233400	It's like a news site.
7233400	7235400	While yes, to some
7235400	7237400	extent, it probably still is bait for page clicks.
7237400	7239400	Most things on the internet are.
7239400	7241400	I kind of felt there was still
7241400	7243400	that history behind the publication.
7243400	7245400	It would be different if this is something they were
7245400	7247400	putting in their magazine, in
7247400	7249400	actual print publication, but it's not.
7249400	7251400	Has
7251400	7253400	Time done an actual video
7253400	7255400	game issue?
7255400	7257400	I don't think, well, in the 80s
7257400	7259400	probably. But I don't think we've had
7259400	7261400	anything modern coming out of there where they actually
7261400	7263400	go into the economics behind it, where they go
7263400	7265400	into the social aspects behind it, because that's something
7265400	7267400	I would put more along the line of
7267400	7269400	Time magazine's caliber.
7269400	7271400	That's the type of editorial I'd want to see out of
7271400	7273400	Time magazine in relation to video games,
7273400	7275400	not a Top 100 list.
7275400	7277400	Jonathan L. with a good reply
7277400	7279400	here on Facebook, well, they're all good, but this one
7279400	7281400	particularly caught my attention.
7281400	7283400	It seems this is actually a list of
7283400	7285400	games that were original for their time,
7285400	7287400	rather than a list of the all-time best.
7287400	7289400	The Super NES library says
7289400	7291400	hi. The list also doesn't
7291400	7293400	have any treasure games, DS games,
7293400	7295400	arcade music games, 3D sports games,
7295400	7297400	3D fighting games, MOBAs, or
7297400	7299400	any of the Top 40 games on Twitch TV
7299400	7301400	right now. Therefore, it is invalid.
7301400	7303400	World of Warcraft has to be
7303400	7305400	in the Top 40 of Twitch TV, for with
7305400	7307400	all the arena matches that go on on there, so I think you
7307400	7309400	might have overlooked that one, but I get your point.
7309400	7311400	I hadn't even considered it. DDR isn't a game on the list.
7311400	7313400	No, DDR was not on the list.
7313400	7315400	Guitar Hero was.
7315400	7317400	I wonder if there's any relationship there.
7317400	7319400	Everyone knows that DDR ripped off Guitar Hero.
7319400	7321400	Here's the thing.
7321400	7323400	In America,
7323400	7325400	I know this is hard for the long-time
7325400	7327400	fans to hear, so just hold your breath
7327400	7329400	for a minute, not too long, don't choke.
7329400	7331400	Guitar Hero made a
7331400	7333400	bigger impact in the States than DDR did.
7333400	7335400	Sorry.
7335400	7337400	Truth hurts.
7337400	7339400	I mean, I won't deny
7339400	7341400	the splash that it made.
7341400	7343400	Whether it should have or not is another argument.
7343400	7345400	I won't argue that.
7345400	7347400	Guitar Hero 1 and 2, I had a
7347400	7349400	hell of a lot of fun with.
7349400	7351400	It was, you know, being
7351400	7353400	the Bimani kid all throughout the
7353400	7355400	98 release up until
7355400	7357400	when did Guitar Hero come out?
7357400	7359400	2007, I believe?
7359400	7361400	Compared to
7361400	7363400	the only other thing that was available at the time,
7363400	7365400	I completely and totally welcomed
7365400	7367400	songs that I would actually know from
7367400	7369400	my youth, a difference
7369400	7371400	in the game, and a very excellent
7371400	7373400	presentation. It's just
7373400	7375400	Guitar Hero and DDR
7375400	7377400	are not, I would not put them
7377400	7379400	close enough together, and they both
7379400	7381400	made a significant
7381400	7383400	splash for each their own
7383400	7385400	reasons. DDR was ridiculously
7385400	7387400	influential in the arcade, even
7387400	7389400	though it can't save them. Not in America, anyways.
7389400	7391400	And Guitar Hero for,
7391400	7393400	you know, less presentation,
7393400	7395400	more performance. I will say, though,
7395400	7397400	to give to the other
7397400	7399400	side of the coin, though, because I am a long-time
7399400	7401400	DDR fan, one thing that should be acknowledged
7401400	7403400	about Dance Dance Revolution that the Guitar Hero
7403400	7405400	can't lay claim to is that
7405400	7407400	none of these video games will you find in a PE
7407400	7409400	class, but
7409400	7411400	DDR is the only game to have broken that barrier.
7411400	7413400	So, you know, again,
7413400	7415400	maybe it's in that same category as Minecraft.
7415400	7417400	DDR in a PE class is
7417400	7419400	kind of a new thing. Give it five or ten
7419400	7421400	years, and maybe we will have
7421400	7423400	accepted it a little more as a culture.
7423400	7425400	Maybe Minecraft will soon become
7425400	7427400	sculpting class lessons. Who knows?
7427400	7429400	Alright, let me read, like, one more of these,
7429400	7431400	and I'm so sorry I didn't get to everybody, but
7431400	7433400	I want to read this one from Degenerate Johnny.
7433400	7435400	It appears to me that most of the
7435400	7437400	mainstream media focuses on commercial successes
7437400	7439400	or games with a cult following.
7439400	7441400	Since this is a top 100 list, it doesn't surprise
7441400	7443400	me that Time did the same thing in this scenario.
7443400	7445400	The purpose of this list was not
7445400	7447400	to inform us gamers, because this is
7447400	7449400	something that we can expect from a generalized top
7449400	7451400	100 list. This list was to inform
7451400	7453400	the magazine's target market,
7453400	7455400	which is clearly not us gamers.
7455400	7457400	Movie buffs
7457400	7459400	don't care about top 100 movie lists for
7459400	7461400	magazines such as Time and People. Why should
7461400	7463400	we? Playboy features games in
7463400	7465400	almost every issue. Should we care about
7465400	7467400	this? Only if there's a centerfold of
7467400	7469400	our favorite video game female characters,
7469400	7471400	or male if you read Playgirl.
7471400	7473400	Jamie, quit drooling over the centerfold of
7473400	7475400	Garrus. Really?
7475400	7477400	Gaming in every issue of Playboy?
7477400	7479400	Honestly? I'm pretty sure they do.
7479400	7481400	It is a magazine for men. Sure.
7481400	7483400	Wow.
7483400	7485400	That's just funny to think about. There's not enough
7485400	7487400	Turian in my life.
7487400	7489400	Okay, before the weird
7489400	7491400	turn that comment took in the second half,
7491400	7493400	I'm so with you on the first
7493400	7495400	half, is that, you know,
7495400	7497400	the mainstream media
7497400	7499400	focuses on commercial successes or games
7499400	7501400	with a cult following. That is where this list really
7501400	7503400	came from. Of course. For the record,
7503400	7505400	I have to say one thing real quick.
7505400	7507400	Do you know what Cleverbot is?
7507400	7509400	Uh, is that an AOL bot?
7509400	7511400	Kinda. It's actually a website you type stuff in and it
7511400	7513400	replies to you. Um, I typed in Turians
7513400	7515400	and it replied, I am the very model of a scientist
7515400	7517400	Larian.
7517400	7519400	Just saying. Cause some nerd
7519400	7521400	works at that website. You know it.
7521400	7523400	Oh, there's Portal ones on here too. Alright, thank you to
7523400	7525400	everybody on both Facebook and Google+. I'm
7525400	7527400	sorry if I didn't read your answer, but we are
7527400	7529400	running a little long tonight. I encourage you to visit
7529400	7531400	both of our communities on Google+.
7531400	7533400	Search for Orange Lounge Radio or
7533400	7535400	Facebook. Go to Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
7535400	7537400	I encourage you to go and read
7537400	7539400	all of the responses and click like
7539400	7541400	or plus one. Or if you're on the
7541400	7543400	Wii U, you can click YEAH!
7543400	7545400	YEAH! YEAH!
7545400	7547400	Cause that's the new, cause obviously
7547400	7549400	like and plus one are trademark terms. So there's
7549400	7551400	it was either YEAH or YEAH.
7551400	7553400	It's one of the two. Y-E-A-H.
7553400	7555400	Why do they have like plus coins or something?
7555400	7557400	That actually would have been a good idea.
7557400	7559400	Or one up. Cause Nintendo
7559400	7561400	just thought of it yesterday.
7561400	7563400	No, no, today.
7563400	7565400	Actually a one up is really fucking cute.
7565400	7567400	Yeah it is.
7567400	7569400	Loki, I think you should go work for Nintendo.
7569400	7571400	Oh because I know what the internet is.
7571400	7573400	Instead of like, what did you just
7573400	7575400	introduce? What did you speak of?
7575400	7577400	Be surprised. Why not?
7577400	7579400	Alright. We have to make
7579400	7581400	we have to make screen name.
7581400	7583400	We'll attach it to the
7583400	7585400	console and what if their console breaks?
7585400	7587400	Our consoles never break you!
7587400	7589400	Death to you! I don't know.
7589400	7591400	Alright, Loki.
7591400	7593400	How about some real news?
7593400	7595400	Some real news. Okay.
7595400	7597400	Let's talk about Black Ops 2.
7597400	7599400	Black Ops 2, big surprise.
7599400	7601400	Biggest title of the year.
7601400	7603400	It has broken all sorts of records.
7603400	7605400	You know, Modern Warfare 3 of course
7605400	7607400	sold 6.5 million copies in the
7607400	7609400	US and UK.
7609400	7611400	And you know, the previous record
7611400	7613400	was 400 million dollars
7613400	7615400	in the first day.
7615400	7617400	Black Ops 2 beat that
7617400	7619400	with 500 million
7619400	7621400	dollars in the first day.
7621400	7623400	So that's a lot of game.
7623400	7625400	And the
7625400	7627400	biggest entertainment launch in
7627400	7629400	history.
7629400	7631400	So, hooray.
7631400	7633400	And I'm sure next year you'll
7633400	7635400	maybe beat your record again.
7635400	7637400	Modern Warfare 4 will break it.
7637400	7639400	Black Ops 3 will break it.
7639400	7641400	Well, if there's new consoles
7641400	7643400	next year though, that could throw an interesting monkey
7643400	7645400	wrench in the situation. Nah, because they'll make it for the other
7645400	7647400	consoles as well. That's true. There'll be
7647400	7649400	that little while where they're making it for
7649400	7651400	everything. Because there's the Wii U version.
7651400	7653400	Are they still making PlayStation
7653400	7655400	2 versions? Nope.
7655400	7657400	That stopped with World
7657400	7659400	of War. Not as of
7659400	7661400	the big titles, but I was actually glancing
7661400	7663400	over and you guys were doing release dates and I do still see
7663400	7665400	some new title PlayStation 2 versions.
7665400	7667400	Pro Evo.
7667400	7669400	Pro Evo, just like the Wii version.
7669400	7671400	FIFA was just like the
7671400	7673400	same thing. Those are just rehashed versions
7673400	7675400	They're there, just saying.
7675400	7677400	New PlayStation 2 titles are crazy to me.
7677400	7679400	To be fair though, didn't we discuss on a prior show
7679400	7681400	that really the only PlayStation 2 game
7681400	7683400	that's left to come out is the Final Fantasy 11
7683400	7685400	expansion? I want to say that came up in a prior show.
7685400	7687400	That like, here's what you have to look forward
7687400	7689400	to in 2013.
7689400	7691400	One PlayStation 2 game.
7691400	7693400	11 expansion? Mhm.
7693400	7695400	Oh, duh. Nevermind.
7695400	7697400	Alright.
7697400	7699400	So yeah, lots of money.
7699400	7701400	Alright, moving on to
7701400	7703400	LEGO Lord of the Rings.
7703400	7705400	I know some of y'all are excited about The Hobbit.
7705400	7707400	And so of course, up comes
7707400	7709400	all the new tie-in games with this.
7709400	7711400	So there's LEGO Lord of the Rings, which I guess
7711400	7713400	granted, LEGO is kind of its own little
7713400	7715400	monster gaming series, but regardless.
7715400	7717400	The Xbox
7717400	7719400	360 version of this came out
7719400	7721400	just this past week, but here's
7721400	7723400	something crazy.
7723400	7725400	I guess some demo discs
7725400	7727400	as opposed to retail game discs
7727400	7729400	got shipped out to retailers.
7729400	7731400	Not quite.
7731400	7733400	Oh, really?
7733400	7735400	The retail discs actually got shipped
7735400	7737400	out, but they were labeled as demo discs.
7737400	7739400	So they weren't
7739400	7741400	actually demo discs, it's just
7741400	7743400	a demo copy on it. But what
7743400	7745400	a collector's item that is, because
7745400	7747400	these stories are saying, quick, you better take them back
7747400	7749400	and get them exchanged. Hell no, you
7749400	7751400	shouldn't hang onto that thing. That's gonna
7751400	7753400	be money to some
7753400	7755400	collector. It's only a small
7755400	7757400	it's not all of them, like in fact,
7757400	7759400	all the ones we got shipped were not like that.
7759400	7761400	Microsoft to Walmart, Target,
7761400	7763400	and Toys R Us is the places
7763400	7765400	you're gonna find this, so not
7765400	7767400	on pod distribution. Sorry, Loki.
7767400	7769400	Nah, sorry, I got my little big
7769400	7771400	planet.
7771400	7773400	So, yeah, very, very
7773400	7775400	interesting. So they are doing an official
7775400	7777400	recall. You can contact WB
7777400	7779400	Games either by email or by
7779400	7781400	phone, but at the same time,
7781400	7783400	if the disc really is
7783400	7785400	the game, then hooray, you have the game.
7785400	7787400	I say enjoy it
7787400	7789400	and then keep that thing in good condition
7789400	7791400	because a collector may want that someday.
7791400	7793400	Maybe. I don't know.
7793400	7795400	I mean, it might be stretching it a bit. It's no
7795400	7797400	what's that frickin'
7797400	7799400	NES game?
7799400	7801400	Stadium Events?
7801400	7803400	What's that game that was for the NES
7803400	7805400	power pad? It was World Class Track Meet before
7805400	7807400	World Class Track Meet.
7807400	7809400	I think it was Stadium Events. That thing goes for
7809400	7811400	like, buku bucks now.
7811400	7813400	Or the
7813400	7815400	competition cartridges from like
7815400	7817400	Nintendo World Championships.
7817400	7819400	Oh, I thought you were gonna say like the Blockbuster
7819400	7821400	Championship thing. Those too. All those cartridges
7821400	7823400	go for buku bucks too, so
7823400	7825400	misprints and shit.
7825400	7827400	Dark Soccer, you collect old stuff. I have a
7827400	7829400	Monopoly.
7829400	7831400	Oh. That's right, a
7831400	7833400	Monopoly. And that was on
7833400	7835400	Genesis? No, Master System.
7835400	7837400	I have two of them.
7837400	7839400	And I have an actual monopoly.
7839400	7841400	Alright.
7841400	7843400	Let's move on with some more
7843400	7845400	no, not more news.
7845400	7847400	Yes.
7847400	7849400	More news. I'm kidding.
7849400	7851400	I'm not with it tonight. Dark Soccer.
7851400	7853400	Well, in other news.
7853400	7855400	And I'm gonna
7855400	7857400	mispronounce the name of this game because I'm not sure
7857400	7859400	exactly how it's said. Is it Arm A?
7859400	7861400	Arm A3? Arma.
7861400	7863400	Arma? Arma 3? Okay. Because it's not a game I'm
7863400	7865400	super interested in, but I'm pretty pissed off
7865400	7867400	about the situation.
7867400	7869400	The developers, Ivan, I guess it's
7869400	7871400	Buchta and Martin Pezlar
7871400	7873400	are, actually
7873400	7875400	have been held in jail for
7875400	7877400	70 days in Greece.
7877400	7879400	Because they have been
7879400	7881400	charged with espionage.
7881400	7883400	They've actually now been refused bail
7883400	7885400	and have to be tried in front of a
7885400	7887400	Greek court. And this is
7887400	7889400	coming from the Czech
7889400	7891400	news site Roslas.
7891400	7893400	Excuse me.
7893400	7895400	They've been made to wake weeks
7895400	7897400	longer because of a
7897400	7899400	strike in the Greek legal system.
7899400	7901400	They've been accused of spying on
7901400	7903400	Greek military installations and face up to
7903400	7905400	20 years in jail.
7905400	7907400	The shooter itself was based on the island where
7907400	7909400	they were arrested. And they
7909400	7911400	said that they were just there on holiday.
7911400	7913400	So, um,
7913400	7915400	they're, and this is just a quote
7915400	7917400	from, um, Ivan's father.
7917400	7919400	They're in a cell with over 25 people.
7919400	7921400	They sleep on the ground. They have food twice
7921400	7923400	a day. Um, they no longer
7923400	7925400	tell us on the phone that it's alright that
7925400	7927400	they're handling it. After the
7927400	7929400	court's decision, we only hear
7929400	7931400	from them something no parent ever wants to hear.
7931400	7933400	Mom, Dad, please save us.
7933400	7935400	So, um, the
7935400	7937400	people have been, um,
7937400	7939400	writing to the Czech president
7939400	7941400	and prime minister saying that the foreign ministry
7941400	7943400	hasn't been doing enough. And the
7943400	7945400	foreign ministry spokesperson says that they're
7945400	7947400	trying to work it from all angles and trying to help
7947400	7949400	them out. So,
7949400	7951400	yeah.
7951400	7953400	Yeah.
7953400	7955400	Yeah, it's an ongoing
7955400	7957400	saga. We heard about that before.
7957400	7959400	And, um, they may be in there a little while,
7959400	7961400	huh? Well, let's hope not.
7961400	7963400	Alright, uh, let's move on.
7963400	7965400	We're almost to the mailbag. The FUs of the Week.
7965400	7967400	And soon, Skype line at 1877
7967400	7969400	Game OLR or Orange
7969400	7971400	L'Anterio on Skype. But first, Loki.
7971400	7973400	And this is kind of unfortunate on the whole
7973400	7975400	mobile front. And actually, I think it's on
7975400	7977400	PC as well, if I remember correctly. Um,
7977400	7979400	but Open Faint, the kind of
7979400	7981400	alternative to using
7981400	7983400	Gamer Room, at least on the iOS platform, and
7983400	7985400	well, it was one of
7985400	7987400	the only kind of multi-platform
7987400	7989400	kind of, uh,
7989400	7991400	hubs for
7991400	7993400	even the Android marketplace. Well,
7993400	7995400	you may remember GREE
7995400	7997400	purchased Open Faint,
7997400	7999400	its parent company, back in April
7999400	8001400	2011. Well, now,
8001400	8003400	Open Faint is gonna be
8003400	8005400	shut down. And they're
8005400	8007400	shutting down the service starting, um,
8007400	8009400	well, actually effective December 14th.
8009400	8011400	And in its place is gonna be GREE's
8011400	8013400	platform that they have, which I've
8013400	8015400	not experienced yet.
8015400	8017400	You know what's funny is, uh,
8017400	8019400	this is what I was teasing about before the break.
8019400	8021400	Um, one of our listeners, Peter Uno, he always
8021400	8023400	does these little live blogs as he's listening to the show.
8023400	8025400	And he was listening to the podcast today.
8025400	8027400	And he said about the show,
8027400	8029400	haha, you just mentioned
8029400	8031400	Open Faint not going out of business.
8031400	8033400	Because we were having that conversation last week about, like,
8033400	8035400	things coexisting. And one of us brought up,
8035400	8037400	I think it was me, brought up the whole, well, you have
8037400	8039400	Game Center, but it didn't put Open Faint out of
8039400	8041400	business. Oops. Well, it didn't.
8041400	8043400	It's just, it's, you know,
8043400	8045400	becoming something else. Yeah, it is
8045400	8047400	still a little bit funny.
8047400	8049400	And, of course, Peter Uno brings it up because
8049400	8051400	GREE is a Japanese company.
8051400	8053400	And very prominent for those titles over there.
8053400	8055400	Ah. And, you know, it didn't really
8055400	8057400	make the regional cross. I remember,
8057400	8059400	uh,
8059400	8061400	early days of the, of these
8061400	8063400	networks really coming out, Aurora Faint
8063400	8065400	turned into Open Faint. And it was
8065400	8067400	just a runaway hit. And I... Wasn't Aurora
8067400	8069400	Faint the game? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
8069400	8071400	Aurora Faint had
8071400	8073400	its little social hub network
8073400	8075400	within game. And whenever
8075400	8077400	they started... That was a huge game in the
8077400	8079400	early days of iOS. And whenever they opened
8079400	8081400	their network, their platform to other
8081400	8083400	people is how it became Open Faint
8083400	8085400	that others could use. I mean,
8085400	8087400	Open Faint in America, Open Faint
8087400	8089400	beat out N.G. Mokos++,
8089400	8091400	who I think was also bought by
8091400	8093400	GREE, um,
8093400	8095400	uh, that beat out Plus Plus. It
8095400	8097400	beat out Crystal or...
8097400	8099400	Crystal's still lagging.
8099400	8101400	I don't see it very often. But Open Faint
8101400	8103400	I see everywhere. And now,
8103400	8105400	for it to go away and
8105400	8107400	to cease functioning this
8107400	8109400	soon is kinda crazy
8109400	8111400	in my mind.
8111400	8113400	Alright. Well, let's move on
8113400	8115400	to a story about another lawsuit in the gaming
8115400	8117400	world. Jamie, I'm really interested on your take
8117400	8119400	on this as a designer. This is really
8119400	8121400	interesting and kinda somebody who has
8121400	8123400	to be aware of, like, copyright
8123400	8125400	work when it comes to design.
8125400	8127400	This has to do with tattoos.
8127400	8129400	So a tattoo artist has sued
8129400	8131400	THQ. And if there's one company
8131400	8133400	that can't afford a lawsuit right now, it's THQ.
8133400	8135400	But a tattoo artist sued
8135400	8137400	THQ over some
8137400	8139400	tattoo art that is seen in
8139400	8141400	UFC Undisputed 2010
8141400	8143400	and UFC Undisputed 3.
8143400	8145400	The tattoo artist is named Chris
8145400	8147400	Escobedo
8147400	8149400	and he filed a lawsuit against THQ
8149400	8151400	because of a tattoo
8151400	8153400	that he has copyrighted
8153400	8155400	that is on MMA fighter Carlos
8155400	8157400	Condit in these UFC
8157400	8159400	games. Now, his argument
8159400	8161400	says that even though his
8161400	8163400	tattoo is on
8163400	8165400	this public figure, the
8165400	8167400	tattoo's design still belongs to
8167400	8169400	him. He created it originally.
8169400	8171400	He never signed the rights to the
8171400	8173400	design-awaited Condit. So by
8173400	8175400	digitally recreating the design,
8175400	8177400	which, you know, THQ did,
8177400	8179400	THQ is said to
8179400	8181400	have, in this lawsuit, violated
8181400	8183400	Escobedo's copyright
8183400	8185400	on the work.
8185400	8187400	The lawsuit goes on to say that THQ using
8187400	8189400	Condit's likeness on the website
8189400	8191400	violates Escobedo's copyright
8191400	8193400	as well. The lawsuit wants
8193400	8195400	actual damages caused by THQ's
8195400	8197400	use of the artwork, as well
8197400	8199400	as an order directing THQ
8199400	8201400	to account to Mr.
8201400	8203400	Escobedo
8203400	8205400	for all gains, profits, and advantages
8205400	8207400	derived by them by their
8207400	8209400	wrongful conduct and to
8209400	8211400	disgorge all profits obtained by their
8211400	8213400	wrongful conduct.
8213400	8215400	He's got a legal point,
8215400	8217400	but, honestly, this is
8217400	8219400	just being selfish and greedy.
8219400	8221400	I mean, maybe he's got bills that need to be paid.
8221400	8223400	I don't know.
8223400	8225400	But, I mean, if I did
8225400	8227400	a design, you know,
8227400	8229400	that's... Now, if it's something
8229400	8231400	that
8231400	8233400	wasn't being worn on a human
8233400	8235400	body, like, if it was, like, say,
8235400	8237400	a banner, or something, or
8237400	8239400	some, like, actual artwork
8239400	8241400	that I put up, you know, as
8241400	8243400	something on display, and they
8243400	8245400	used that, like, as a logo, or
8245400	8247400	something you
8247400	8249400	specifically, with the intention
8249400	8251400	of making money off of it,
8251400	8253400	instead of actually recreating
8253400	8255400	a personal likeness,
8255400	8257400	then, yeah, I would, I would kinda go after
8257400	8259400	that. I would say, you know, you're using something
8259400	8261400	that I did, and making money,
8261400	8263400	using it for the express purpose of making money.
8263400	8265400	All they did was recreate
8265400	8267400	a likeness, and the guy licensed
8267400	8269400	his likeness, which includes
8269400	8271400	everything attached to his likeness.
8271400	8273400	Do you think maybe the tattoo artist
8273400	8275400	should be going after this
8275400	8277400	fighter? Because the fighter should've known
8277400	8279400	about this before he licensed it. Well, on
8279400	8281400	top of that, when you do a tattoo for
8281400	8283400	somebody, as far as I
8283400	8285400	understand, unless you
8285400	8287400	have filed a legit copyright
8287400	8289400	on this item, first
8289400	8291400	of all, the, um,
8291400	8293400	the fighter should've been up
8293400	8295400	front and said something if there was an
8295400	8297400	actual, uh,
8297400	8299400	copyright filed.
8299400	8301400	If there's not a copyright filed
8301400	8303400	on it, this guy has no ground to stand on.
8303400	8305400	You know,
8305400	8307400	in fact, I think it's any,
8307400	8309400	um, unless this guy, it's this guy's
8309400	8311400	private business, I think that any
8311400	8313400	tattoo artist, unless they're, like,
8313400	8315400	an independent contractor,
8315400	8317400	listens over their work to the studio they do
8317400	8319400	the work for. Uh, Loki, I want to get to your thoughts,
8319400	8321400	too, as well as Jason, if he has any, but, um,
8321400	8323400	going to the chat room, because this is the exact same
8323400	8325400	thing I thought of. DukeNukem at
8325400	8327400	live.vognetwork.com says, didn't the
8327400	8329400	same kind of thing happen with the Tyson tattoo
8329400	8331400	in the Hangover Part 2? I believe
8331400	8333400	it did. That's the exact same thing I thought of, is that
8333400	8335400	they had to go, like, digitally re-
8335400	8337400	re-do that guy. Uh, Loki,
8337400	8339400	your thought. Well, I was just gonna say, I don't think it's anything
8339400	8341400	that, I, can you even
8341400	8343400	do that? I mean, because if you think about it,
8343400	8345400	you, you have this copyright thing,
8345400	8347400	so he can't make any, you know, public
8347400	8349400	appearances anywhere, because if he's captured on
8349400	8351400	camera, oh, it's a, it's a copyright
8351400	8353400	violation. That seems a little stupid,
8353400	8355400	like, if you, if you're putting it on somebody.
8355400	8357400	Now, if it was something blatant, like, he
8357400	8359400	had him tattoo Nintendo's logo on
8359400	8361400	his face or something like that, then,
8361400	8363400	that's a little kind of- What about that guy who got the
8363400	8365400	Romney tattoos all over the
8365400	8367400	internet this week? I'm actually checking with one of my
8367400	8369400	favorite sites ever, Freakonomics.
8369400	8371400	I love Freakonomics.
8371400	8373400	Um, they're basically going
8373400	8375400	on here, and they're going over that case, they're talking about
8375400	8377400	the hangover part two, um,
8377400	8379400	about the art appearing without the
8379400	8381400	artist's consent.
8381400	8383400	Um, okay.
8383400	8385400	Alright, if the film-
8385400	8387400	I'm gonna read this paragraph here.
8387400	8389400	If the film had featured an etching by
8389400	8391400	Whitmill, who's the guy, the studio
8391400	8393400	would have had to get the rights to show it, and the film
8393400	8395400	cleared. That is approved by the copyright owner.
8395400	8397400	That clearance process is a major headache
8397400	8399400	for a lot of filmmakers, especially documentarians
8399400	8401400	who film real life, and
8401400	8403400	therefore capture things like songs, TV shows,
8403400	8405400	and artwork. The same rule applies to
8405400	8407400	the tattoo. So far, so good for
8407400	8409400	Whitmill. Okay. And then,
8409400	8411400	so they're basically using it
8411400	8413400	as that. Now, they're asking, does Warner Brothers
8413400	8415400	have a way out? The studio may claim that the tattoo
8415400	8417400	is not original, that it was inspired by
8417400	8419400	Maori tattoos. Um,
8419400	8421400	this is unlikely to work. Copyright's
8421400	8423400	originality threshold is very low. Even
8423400	8425400	if Whitmill adapted his design
8425400	8427400	from one in the public domain, it will
8427400	8429400	nonetheless be copyrightable if not
8429400	8431400	copied exactly. If it
8431400	8433400	is not copied exactly.
8433400	8435400	Alright, before we move on to the mailbag,
8435400	8437400	anything? Oh. One last thing. Uh-huh.
8437400	8439400	They say that it is also, though, quite
8439400	8441400	likely protected under fair use doctrine.
8441400	8443400	Oh.
8443400	8445400	Mm. Interesting.
8445400	8447400	Um. I voted for Freakonomics on Podcast
8447400	8449400	Awards.
8449400	8451400	Best one in their category that I saw. I love
8451400	8453400	I actually had the Freakonomics
8453400	8455400	desk calendar. I used it for
8455400	8457400	three years. I would get it every
8457400	8459400	year. You learn a lot
8459400	8461400	from this website. Anyway, just saying.
8461400	8463400	But yeah, that came from Freakonomics.com
8463400	8465400	Um, copyright. Blah blah.
8465400	8467400	Alright.
8467400	8469400	Yeah, I was gonna ask the same question.
8469400	8471400	Why isn't this an issue on especially
8471400	8473400	pay-per-view, uh, mixed
8473400	8475400	martial arts, pay-per-view, uh,
8475400	8477400	UFC broadcasts? Um,
8477400	8479400	you know, licensing. God
8479400	8481400	only knows what happens behind the scenes, but I'm
8481400	8483400	surprised that this hasn't come up before.
8483400	8485400	Um, scary situation.
8485400	8487400	The, before having
8487400	8489400	known those details, I was gonna say
8489400	8491400	flat out that this is, this is
8491400	8493400	Carlos Condit's problems, and he's on the hook
8493400	8495400	for this problem for any license
8495400	8497400	agreement broken or otherwise.
8497400	8499400	I kind of agree with you, is that,
8499400	8501400	you know, before you get a piece of art
8501400	8503400	permanently put on your body, you better think about
8503400	8505400	who owns that art. And you wanna say that
8505400	8507400	at the same time, you wanna say
8507400	8509400	original or not, it's a tattoo
8509400	8511400	and it's there. Unless you're getting it on
8511400	8513400	your butt where no one will ever see it.
8513400	8515400	But special people. Clearly not the
8515400	8517400	case in this situation, but of course.
8517400	8519400	Yeah, I, that, this is a,
8519400	8521400	that's a, that's a really crappy situation.
8521400	8523400	I, not having the expertise,
8523400	8525400	I don't really wanna comment anymore, but that's a scary thought.
8525400	8527400	I do still think it's a case of money-grabbing.
8527400	8529400	I'm gonna get the copyright Mike Tyson
8529400	8531400	tattoo on my butt and no one will ever
8531400	8533400	know, and I'll get away with a crime.
8533400	8535400	You know what's gonna happen is
8535400	8537400	that THQ, somebody is gonna shell out
8537400	8539400	damages and there's gonna be a patch that's gonna
8539400	8541400	be devoted to removing this in-game. Period.
8541400	8543400	That's, that's the era we live in.
8543400	8545400	You know that there's gonna be a patch that adds in
8545400	8547400	a special copyright notice.
8547400	8549400	Or licensed from
8549400	8551400	A 1K patch with tensed alterations.
8551400	8553400	This is all time that THQ could spend
8553400	8555400	working on like something to make them money.
8555400	8557400	Something to entertain people.
8557400	8559400	So, alright
8559400	8561400	let's go to the mailbag. Every week you guys
8561400	8563400	send us emails. Mailbag at
8563400	8565400	orangelaunchradio.com and we read
8565400	8567400	some of our favorites here on the show.
8567400	8569400	DarkSakura has asked me to dive
8569400	8571400	into the mailbag tonight and I said
8571400	8573400	sure! Why not?
8573400	8575400	I'll get my hands dirty. The price?
8575400	8577400	Why didn't KZDM?
8577400	8579400	Alright.
8579400	8581400	Let's go to
8581400	8583400	Redertainment who sends us our first email tonight.
8583400	8585400	Greetings podcrafters!
8585400	8587400	Over the past couple days I've experienced a
8587400	8589400	problem playing Assassin's Creed 3 on
8589400	8591400	the 360. When I turn on my 360
8591400	8593400	to play the game, I see
8593400	8595400	a screen saying open tray
8595400	8597400	where I should be seeing the screen where
8597400	8599400	play game screen usually appears.
8599400	8601400	It takes a couple times of me opening
8601400	8603400	and closing the 360 DVD tray to get
8603400	8605400	the play Assassin's Creed 3 screen to come up.
8605400	8607400	I do not believe this is a problem
8607400	8609400	with the DVD drive as other games
8609400	8611400	WWE 13, Dragon Age Origins
8611400	8613400	Rockstar Table Tennis appear as normal.
8613400	8615400	Neither do I experience
8615400	8617400	this issue with any other DVDs or
8617400	8619400	CDs I've put into the DVD drive recently.
8619400	8621400	Only Assassin's Creed 3 on
8621400	8623400	Xbox 360 has given me this problem.
8623400	8625400	My 360 is unmodded so that's not
8625400	8627400	the problem. Also the Assassin's Creed
8627400	8629400	3 game disc does not appear to be
8629400	8631400	broken, scratched, warped, chipped or otherwise
8631400	8633400	damaged. I've tried searching around
8633400	8635400	online and can't find anyone else experiencing
8635400	8637400	this problem. Or at least no one
8637400	8639400	online is bitching about this problem.
8639400	8641400	Am I an anomaly or is
8641400	8643400	anyone else experiencing this problem
8643400	8645400	with Assassin's Creed 3 on the 360?
8645400	8647400	Stay black, Redertainment.
8647400	8649400	Have you tried turning it off and
8649400	8651400	back on again? Sorry.
8651400	8653400	I would say if you're still having
8653400	8655400	trouble doing that maybe try launching it
8655400	8657400	from one of the quick launch menus.
8657400	8659400	Or hit the guide button. You can launch games
8659400	8661400	I think through that as well. But the quick launch menu
8661400	8663400	will allow you to launch it as well.
8663400	8665400	I have actually had this problem
8665400	8667400	happen. And not on Assassin's Creed 3
8667400	8669400	but another game. And
8669400	8671400	there were a lot of fingerprints on
8671400	8673400	the disc. Now I know you said you checked
8673400	8675400	out your disc and it seems to be clean.
8675400	8677400	I'm wondering if
8677400	8679400	it's something where you can't see it.
8679400	8681400	Disc rot.
8681400	8683400	Well it's Assassin's Creed 3.
8683400	8685400	I mean that just came out.
8685400	8687400	I guess you never know. You never know.
8687400	8689400	Hey, there were whole laser discs that had disc rot at shipping.
8689400	8691400	If you have the ability to do so
8691400	8693400	I would just install the game
8693400	8695400	to your drive to be safe.
8695400	8697400	Granted you still need the game to boot
8697400	8699400	the file but I think you'll have a little more
8699400	8701400	luck there. Otherwise
8701400	8703400	I would clean the disc
8703400	8705400	anyway. You might not
8705400	8707400	be able to see it. And clearly you've already
8707400	8709400	established it's not your 360.
8709400	8711400	It's the disc.
8711400	8713400	And I don't know an Assassin's Creed 3
8713400	8715400	so it was another game. Try it in another person's
8715400	8717400	system to see if it's actually the disc.
8717400	8719400	I actually want to say it was Mass Effect 2.
8719400	8721400	Because I bought that used.
8721400	8723400	And Mass Effect 2 is fucking up all the games.
8723400	8725400	Seriously.
8725400	8727400	I'm pissed off at my Mass Effect 2
8727400	8729400	because I have the version that it does with a launcher
8729400	8731400	and now I can't use text mod at the end.
8731400	8733400	Don't. Alright let's go to
8733400	8735400	an email from Ramaditya
8735400	8737400	from Indonesia.
8737400	8739400	Hi guys it's Ramaditya from Indonesia.
8739400	8741400	I don't know if you've already
8741400	8743400	known about this. I believe you're familiar
8743400	8745400	with an NES game called Blaster Master
8745400	8747400	from Sunsoft. Oh yes.
8747400	8749400	One of my all time favorites.
8749400	8751400	You know what in fact now
8751400	8753400	that you brought it up. See now
8753400	8755400	I have to. Now I have to.
8755400	8757400	You brought it up.
8757400	8759400	So now I have to dig through
8759400	8761400	the folder. Well good that means the song will be stuck
8761400	8763400	in my head. Here you go.
8765400	8771400	Much better.
8771400	8773400	In fact it was one of my favorite games
8773400	8775400	when I was a child. Several days ago
8775400	8777400	I found out the info about
8777400	8779400	the hack version of Blaster Master.
8779400	8781400	The patch allows you to play
8781400	8783400	eight completely different levels from the game.
8783400	8785400	Because I cannot see
8785400	8787400	so it's impossible to tell you how good or bad
8787400	8789400	it is. But my girlfriend the one that
8789400	8791400	tried the game informed me it was great.
8791400	8793400	To know more about it please visit the link
8793400	8795400	below and he has a link to Zofar.net
8795400	8797400	which I. My first
8797400	8799400	reaction was that site's still
8799400	8801400	around. I remember
8801400	8803400	hanging out in IRC chat rooms that
8803400	8805400	Zofar was in. That was years. I was in college
8805400	8807400	then okay. Last I knew Zofar
8807400	8809400	was ad bombed and scary
8809400	8811400	as a result to go to it. Zofar's
8811400	8813400	got to be my age.
8813400	8815400	At least. He's mid 30's
8815400	8817400	for sure. Mr. International House of
8817400	8819400	Brahms. Anyhow
8819400	8821400	to know more
8821400	8823400	about it please visit the link below. It has the info
8823400	8825400	the game trailer and the patch itself.
8825400	8827400	So hope it blasts your day.
8827400	8829400	Now the link here is kind of lengthy
8829400	8831400	so I'll just tell you to go to Zofar at
8831400	8833400	Z-O-P-H-A-R
8833400	8835400	dot net if you didn't already know. And look for
8835400	8837400	Blaster Remaster.
8837400	8839400	A lot of people in the emulation scene did
8839400	8841400	this shit with like Mario Brothers. I
8841400	8843400	can't tell you. When hacking and sprite changing
8843400	8845400	when Nesticle implemented
8845400	8847400	and yes that's what it was called.
8847400	8849400	When Nesticle implemented the sprite changing
8849400	8851400	abilities Super
8851400	8853400	Penis Brothers was out within minutes.
8853400	8855400	Like everybody
8855400	8857400	did basic hacks to the game.
8857400	8859400	But they got like more and more and more in depth
8859400	8861400	and now you've got all these level changes.
8861400	8863400	Did you ever remember the
8863400	8865400	Metroid level
8865400	8867400	editor that they made? Oh yeah.
8867400	8869400	And there's actually several now
8869400	8871400	whole new versions of Metroid.
8871400	8873400	Classic Metroid that different layouts and
8873400	8875400	everything that are really well done.
8875400	8877400	Well thank you for a blast
8877400	8879400	in the past. Maybe it'll be better than that
8879400	8881400	Wii version they did
8881400	8883400	some time ago. There you go.
8883400	8885400	Ramaditya from Indonesia.
8885400	8887400	I love being in an international show.
8887400	8889400	Alright moving on.
8889400	8891400	Let's see. Here's a cheap
8891400	8893400	plug from Travis H.
8893400	8895400	This is worth mentioning because it has
8895400	8897400	to do with our old favorite pastime.
8897400	8899400	Travis H. sent us a plug here.
8899400	8901400	I will attempt the DDR
8901400	8903400	marathon record again on
8903400	8905400	November 23rd at 5 AM
8905400	8907400	Eastern to November 24th
8907400	8909400	to 9 PM Eastern. But this time
8909400	8911400	on Doubles Play.
8911400	8913400	He links
8913400	8915400	to an event on Facebook and
8915400	8917400	something called crowdrise.com
8917400	8919400	slash DDR world
8919400	8921400	record. So he's doing
8921400	8923400	the record. Is it for charity?
8923400	8925400	That's what I want to know. He's going to do it in Knoxville, Tennessee.
8925400	8927400	Ah here we go.
8927400	8929400	It is for charity. He raised $1000 for
8929400	8931400	local charity through the event. He wants
8931400	8933400	to double his results this year.
8933400	8935400	Rescue ministries meals.
8935400	8937400	I will be pledging two meals
8937400	8939400	per one hour that I compete. Well at least
8939400	8941400	it's for a good cause at the end of the day.
8941400	8943400	So I'm all
8943400	8945400	for everybody trying to one up each other on
8945400	8947400	these marathons and Guinness Book of World Records
8947400	8949400	and stuff when it's for charity. So good on you.
8949400	8951400	Speaking of charity, am I not
8951400	8953400	correct? Desert Bus started again
8953400	8955400	this weekend. Really? Yes.
8955400	8957400	Fine. Desert Bus is going. Umlaut's
8957400	8959400	coming up of course. You've heard Jamie
8959400	8961400	talk about that. God yes. I'm
8961400	8963400	still working on badges. It's
8963400	8965400	that time of year for child's play.
8965400	8967400	By the way, I want to let you
8967400	8969400	know that I was watching some Guinness World Records stuff.
8969400	8971400	They fit 28 women into a mini.
8971400	8973400	Wow.
8973400	8975400	I know. I'm like why do people think that this
8975400	8977400	is record worthy? Oh
8977400	8979400	and the longest note on the didgeridoo was
8979400	8981400	won by a 14 year old. Just saying.
8981400	8983400	I miss
8983400	8985400	didgeridoos.
8985400	8987400	I miss techno didgeridoo.
8987400	8989400	Remember that? That was a thing on OLR
8989400	8991400	years ago. I wanted
8991400	8993400	to bring up the didgeridoo for that.
8993400	8995400	Quick charity is something
8995400	8997400	that's interesting and actually the reason
8997400	8999400	I mentioned that I've been out here in California for over a week
8999400	9001400	and I wasn't on last week's show because my
9001400	9003400	employer held a dodgeball
9003400	9005400	charity tournament for
9005400	9007400	it was basically a who's who of the
9007400	9009400	startups and you know Silicon Valley
9009400	9011400	mostly San Francisco area
9011400	9013400	competitors and it was a whole hell of a lot of
9013400	9015400	fun. I believe it was 60,000
9015400	9017400	for local San Francisco charities.
9017400	9019400	It was
9019400	9021400	you know dodgeball. What experience
9021400	9023400	do we have from dodgeball?
9023400	9025400	The NES version that was amazing and
9025400	9027400	Jim and this was
9027400	9029400	there were 20 teams. It was a
9029400	9031400	Neo Geo game too which was
9031400	9033400	amazing. 20
9033400	9035400	20 teams of
9035400	9037400	across 17 businesses
9037400	9039400	a whole day's worth of fun.
9039400	9041400	It was amazing and even the
9041400	9043400	World Dodgeball Society came out to officiate
9043400	9045400	it and everything. It was a great time.
9045400	9047400	Dodgeball was a fun game.
9047400	9049400	That was one of my favorites growing up. Absolutely.
9049400	9051400	Alright. You ready to get taken back
9051400	9053400	with this inside joke?
9063400	9065400	We're all dancing. I want the DDR guy to dance to that.
9069400	9071400	If I'm ever a wrestler that's
9071400	9073400	the music I'm coming out to.
9073400	9075400	Alright. Last email tonight from
9075400	9077400	Elliot B.
9103400	9105400	Elliot B.
9105400	9107400	I had no idea that series
9107400	9109400	was 10 years old but it makes
9109400	9111400	perfect sense. You know
9111400	9113400	if Virtual Console on
9113400	9115400	Wii U were to start making GameCube
9115400	9117400	games show up which isn't outside the realm
9117400	9119400	of possibility. That's very possible.
9119400	9121400	Metroid Prime would sure be a
9121400	9123400	prime candidate to kick things
9123400	9125400	off.
9129400	9131400	Elliot's regretting that he sent that email.
9133400	9135400	Anyhow.
9135400	9137400	That's it for
9137400	9139400	emails this week. Mailbag at
9139400	9141400	orangeloungeradio.com
9141400	9143400	A few more stories for you guys and then
9143400	9145400	the uh... Will he be having the Metroid
9145400	9147400	primaries?
9149400	9151400	Yeah. He's really regretting sending that email.
9151400	9153400	You know we're gonna have an empty mailbag again next
9153400	9155400	week and we're gonna say why isn't anybody emailing us?
9155400	9157400	Oh yeah because we always tell the stupidest
9157400	9159400	jokes. Alright.
9159400	9161400	Let's get. Now would be an appropriate
9161400	9163400	time to do the FUs of the week.
9179400	9181400	FUs of the week. Dark Sakura.
9181400	9183400	FU to uh...
9183400	9185400	me not having a cat.
9185400	9187400	I really want a cat.
9187400	9189400	My husband says that we can't get a
9189400	9191400	cat until we buy a house. So he better
9191400	9193400	hurry up and buy me a house so I can get a cat.
9193400	9195400	At the end.
9197400	9199400	I don't know. I really don't have anything I
9199400	9201400	can be angry about. I guess FUs
9201400	9203400	of the fact that earlier this week I had to take
9203400	9205400	a few days off work because my car was
9205400	9207400	broken. But it doesn't matter anymore
9207400	9209400	because I have a different car. So.
9209400	9211400	Ha. Congrats.
9211400	9213400	We're Honda buddies. Yeah. Honda.
9213400	9215400	Is it a DeLorean? It's not a DeLorean.
9215400	9217400	I will be happy with my
9217400	9219400	Ponte Yoda.
9219400	9221400	Um.
9221400	9223400	FU to the utter
9223400	9225400	lack of self control that I have
9225400	9227400	and my credit card bill next month.
9227400	9229400	But yay to those reward
9229400	9231400	points. Uh.
9231400	9233400	Jason. Um.
9233400	9235400	FU to not
9235400	9237400	having a car because we're down to one and Brian
9237400	9239400	actually has to drive to work.
9239400	9241400	FU to Wells Fargo for
9241400	9243400	reasons that I don't really need to go into but are probably
9243400	9245400	completely obvious. I can
9245400	9247400	guess based on the FU. Yeah. And related
9247400	9249400	to that FU did $2 keyboards and
9249400	9251400	$50 computers. Those you know people
9251400	9253400	places like Wells Fargo that have to buy
9253400	9255400	these cheap ass little computers because everything
9255400	9257400	runs in a web browser. I hate those
9257400	9259400	keyboards. I don't know if it's
9259400	9261400	just ingrained to me because
9261400	9263400	I've always worked desk computer
9263400	9265400	keyboard jobs. But holy crap
9265400	9267400	you have a crappy keyboard and computers become
9267400	9269400	a thing that
9269400	9271400	an impossible thing.
9271400	9273400	Oh man. I did not
9273400	9275400	realize that that's ever something they would
9275400	9277400	say to me. Um.
9277400	9279400	FU to the
9279400	9281400	there's this bridge
9281400	9283400	near Berkeley north of the
9283400	9285400	Bay Bridge. Overpass rather north of the
9285400	9287400	Bay Bridge. And every time I've been
9287400	9289400	out here and come up towards Sacramento there's a sign
9289400	9291400	up there. Investigate 9-11.
9291400	9293400	Stop the war. I get the sentiment but
9293400	9295400	you're still up there. It's Berkeley.
9295400	9297400	Just wow.
9297400	9299400	No. It's Berkeley.
9299400	9301400	And related to that FU did
9301400	9303400	We love Berkeley but they bring
9303400	9305400	the crazy. And that's why we love them.
9305400	9307400	We need a little unpredictability in our life.
9307400	9309400	And related to that FU to the
9309400	9311400	Coney burned and carved into
9311400	9313400	the hillside that I saw going up here.
9313400	9315400	How many votes did he end up getting for president?
9317400	9319400	It's a joke. Wow. What?
9319400	9321400	Oh what? Was he
9321400	9323400	on the Colorado ballot like I was talking about?
9323400	9325400	He might have been. Did I miss something?
9325400	9327400	You haven't heard that joke? I just told like
9327400	9329400	the same joke that went around Twitter all day
9329400	9331400	after election. With all the bumper
9331400	9333400	stickers on cars how many votes
9333400	9335400	did he get in the election? Wow.
9335400	9337400	It's actually pretty good. Come on.
9337400	9339400	FU to me for being out of the scene.
9339400	9341400	Lastly
9341400	9343400	FU to the Wii U for sometimes just
9343400	9345400	not having button shortcuts
9345400	9347400	so you have to let go of the
9347400	9349400	controller tap on
9349400	9351400	I just haven't built it yet.
9351400	9353400	It I'm sure
9353400	9355400	will be patched but it's just it feels
9355400	9357400	weird. That's one of those doors that goes into a room
9357400	9359400	where surprise it's nothing. I can't wait
9359400	9361400	for the next five gigabyte patch so that'll
9361400	9363400	laugh. Sorry you
9363400	9365400	we owners that have the eight gigabyte model
9365400	9367400	you're just not going to be able to have the
9367400	9369400	shortcuts because it's another five gigabytes.
9369400	9371400	Good enough.
9371400	9373400	I still don't okay I still
9373400	9375400	don't understand Miiverse. I
9375400	9377400	can't just make a post to show
9377400	9379400	all my friends. Do you really? I have to post
9379400	9381400	in the like if I want to
9381400	9383400	show my cat I've got to go to
9383400	9385400	the Mass Effect 3 community and say hey
9385400	9387400	Mass Effect 3 community. I just want to
9387400	9389400	post a picture of my cat. Do you really
9389400	9391400	want a public Nintendo operated
9391400	9393400	Twitter clone though?
9393400	9395400	Well well
9395400	9397400	well
9397400	9399400	well it
9399400	9401400	offers me something that Twitter doesn't
9401400	9403400	and that is hand drawn
9403400	9405400	stylus messages. It sounds
9405400	9407400	to me that this whole
9407400	9409400	Miiverse thing is going to like kind of
9409400	9411400	devolve into some sort of like game
9411400	9413400	facts forum
9413400	9415400	to be fair
9415400	9417400	it works better than the
9417400	9419400	Vita's thing which I still
9419400	9421400	like I don't like you know the Vita has
9421400	9423400	that whole thing like you can see like what your
9423400	9425400	friends are doing and you can even comment on
9425400	9427400	posts. Nobody fucking knows
9427400	9429400	it's there. You probably don't even know what I'm
9429400	9431400	talking about. It's under the achievements
9431400	9433400	trophy screen. Like no no when you go into the
9433400	9435400	games you hit the little thing that says
9435400	9437400	down and it shows you the feed like so and so
9437400	9439400	just got this game. So and so unlocked
9439400	9441400	a trophy and you can actually like
9441400	9443400	or you know whatever the PlayStation version of
9443400	9445400	like is you can like
9445400	9447400	posts and comment and all that
9447400	9449400	shit like it was Facebook but no ain't
9449400	9451400	nobody reading it
9451400	9453400	because it's integrated very shitty
9453400	9455400	like like I'm going to go into each
9455400	9457400	individual game I own to look at the feed like
9457400	9459400	that should be to Nintendo's
9459400	9461400	credit at least that's the thing
9461400	9463400	that comes up when I turn my Nintendo
9463400	9465400	on. I looked at some
9465400	9467400	of those video game community feeds and it's
9467400	9469400	can I should I get this game
9469400	9471400	can somebody tell me if I should get this game
9471400	9473400	should I get this game. There were a
9473400	9475400	lot of really awesome
9475400	9477400	drawn art like I was I was
9477400	9479400	paging through Ninja Gaiden and there were a
9479400	9481400	bunch of like Ninja drawings and cheap jokes
9481400	9483400	that's the most detailed penis I've
9483400	9485400	ever seen. Yeah
9485400	9487400	Tiger Claw sent me a link saying are you
9487400	9489400	sure you want this to happen and then
9489400	9491400	of course you know tada
9491400	9493400	it's a penis drawn on the Wii U
9493400	9495400	what a shock series
9495400	9497400	looks like multiple penises actually a lot
9497400	9499400	that is their upside you know what
9499400	9501400	that's the banner of dick it's just
9501400	9503400	it's it's a drawing
9503400	9505400	of an alien planet where mushrooms
9505400	9507400	grow from the ceiling that's what it is
9507400	9509400	there are I still call it the banner
9509400	9511400	of dick there are cave
9511400	9513400	formations that do this I think it's funny that it's
9513400	9515400	under archery and swordplay
9521400	9523400	well played Bravo
9523400	9525400	does that make the TTP two hours
9525400	9527400	and forty five minutes
9531400	9533400	this is just one of those shows
9533400	9535400	all right Bravo JD
9535400	9537400	one Tiger
9537400	9539400	Claw suggests maybe it is Turian
9539400	9541400	genitalia I think
9541400	9543400	that Turian cock looks different than that
9543400	9545400	yeah that would imply that like Turians
9545400	9547400	pull down their pants and it's like an octopus
9547400	9549400	down there okay from those drawings that
9549400	9551400	would imply that Turians have
9551400	9553400	foreskins
9553400	9555400	moving on and
9555400	9557400	quickly
9557400	9559400	Loki what do you have for us
9559400	9561400	before we get we're up almost to the skype line
9561400	9563400	at one eight seven seven game OLR
9563400	9565400	we're on skype orange lounge radio we're
9565400	9567400	almost there but not just yet I don't have banners
9567400	9569400	of cocks unless that's a new game
9569400	9571400	franchise that they're gonna put out get out
9571400	9573400	but Ubisoft is
9573400	9575400	you know they may be interested in
9575400	9577400	thq's assets
9577400	9579400	of course you know
9579400	9581400	their boss
9581400	9583400	is it Vess
9583400	9585400	I'm not even gonna try to pronounce it French guy
9585400	9587400	anyways
9587400	9589400	anyways he basically said
9589400	9591400	yeah they're always interested in good brands and
9591400	9593400	you know it may be something
9593400	9595400	they can consider buying some of the IP
9595400	9597400	from them
9597400	9599400	I think it's just all speculation that kind of go on
9599400	9601400	reaching out to people saying hey you know
9601400	9603400	what do you think
9603400	9605400	what do you think thq's assets
9605400	9607400	impact is gonna be on like you know
9607400	9609400	the neo geo console or
9609400	9611400	the dreamcast or something like that
9611400	9613400	but you know they're just
9613400	9615400	kind of reaching
9615400	9617400	obviously if they struggle enough then they're gonna try to
9617400	9619400	sell off IP but I think they've already
9619400	9621400	sold off IP or at least stop making
9621400	9623400	stuff I know they're still
9623400	9625400	sitting on a bunch of those you know you draw
9625400	9627400	tablets that's for sure
9627400	9629400	but
9629400	9631400	I don't know I think right now they've kind of
9631400	9633400	limited it down to what they're gonna work
9633400	9635400	with and they're gonna make some
9635400	9637400	quality games based on it or at least they're gonna
9637400	9639400	try and fail
9639400	9641400	but we'll see
9641400	9643400	I tell you one IP they're not
9643400	9645400	interested in right now
9645400	9647400	UFC Undisputed
9647400	9649400	well that's not theirs anymore
9649400	9651400	that would be EA
9651400	9653400	oh
9653400	9655400	well just kill that joke
9655400	9657400	they aren't interested in it
9657400	9659400	because EA bought it already
9661400	9663400	alrighty then
9663400	9665400	uh
9665400	9667400	I got one more story for you guys
9667400	9669400	and uh you know
9669400	9671400	I know this I know
9671400	9673400	that this is the reason that you guys tune in
9673400	9675400	to Orange Lounge Radio is that
9675400	9677400	you wanna have your news
9677400	9679400	on Beyonce
9679400	9681400	and I've got your Beyonce
9681400	9683400	news for you right here and it has to do
9683400	9685400	with that lawsuit that was going on
9685400	9687400	between Beyonce and
9687400	9689400	Gate 5 uh this was that
9689400	9691400	whole thing about Superstar Beyonce
9691400	9693400	that was gonna happen and then she backed out of the deal
9693400	9695400	so uh
9695400	9697400	here it is now the appeal
9697400	9699400	of the judgment
9699400	9701400	where Beyonce's lawyers tried
9701400	9703400	to basically get it thrown out
9703400	9705400	they wanted a summary judgment in April
9705400	9707400	saying that Gate 5 didn't pull in the financing
9707400	9709400	that appeal failed
9709400	9711400	this doesn't mean Beyonce has lost
9711400	9713400	but this means we're gonna get
9713400	9715400	the trial of the century
9715400	9717400	it's gonna go to trial and a jury
9717400	9719400	will deter if they don't settle first
9719400	9721400	yeah that was just like trial of the century
9721400	9723400	call duty and settle
9723400	9725400	where a jury will have to determine if Beyonce
9725400	9727400	was within her contract to leave the project
9727400	9729400	or if she broke the agreement
9729400	9731400	so uh we could get a trial
9731400	9733400	out of this that would be kinda fun
9733400	9735400	yeah it'll settle you know it'll settle
9737400	9739400	but all I gotta say
9739400	9741400	is man two keytars
9741400	9743400	that's just fancy
9743400	9745400	here's the thing we're looking at this little picture
9745400	9747400	of Beyonce doing her little sachet
9747400	9749400	like her one keyboard girl's really into it over here
9749400	9751400	but look at this one
9751400	9753400	this one that looks like Juliette Lewis with blonde hair
9753400	9755400	she looks like the chick
9755400	9757400	from Mean Girls or whatever
9757400	9759400	oh no no not Mean Girls
9759400	9761400	I'm sorry she looks like the chick from Glee
9761400	9763400	the one that always has the blank
9763400	9765400	oh Britney why do I know that
9765400	9767400	oh god you know what I can safely say
9767400	9769400	I've never seen an episode of that show
9769400	9771400	I am so gay
9771400	9773400	and I can say that
9773400	9775400	I watched part of the series
9775400	9777400	the first few seasons just because
9777400	9779400	it was by the guy that did Nip Tuck
9779400	9781400	although that series was weird
9781400	9783400	but yeah I got out of it after about
9783400	9785400	I think it's a couple scenes
9785400	9787400	I have seen one episode of Nip Tuck
9787400	9789400	that's where they put all the liposuction fat in the woman's car
9789400	9791400	that's the only episode I've seen
9791400	9793400	American Horror Story is much better
9793400	9795400	it's messed up
9795400	9797400	yeah it's also him
9797400	9799400	if you like the FX show
9799400	9801400	you'll like American Horror Story
9801400	9803400	which is also an FX show
9803400	9805400	alright
9805400	9807400	they're on season 2 even
9807400	9809400	yes so after all that
9809400	9811400	Beyonce and Glee news
9811400	9813400	we can finally go back to video games
9813400	9815400	and your phone calls
9815400	9817400	Skype line is open right now
9817400	9819400	1877
9819400	9821400	game
9821400	9823400	or our username on Skype
9823400	9825400	is Orange Launch Radio
9825400	9827400	all one word
9827400	9829400	I'll get to the twitter topics here in just a moment
9829400	9831400	but I thought I'd check in with Loki first
9832400	9834400	yeah this is kind of weird I guess
9834400	9836400	so Nintendo for your Nintendo ID if you're a minor
9836400	9838400	requires a credit card verification
9838400	9840400	that's going to cost you 50 cents
9840400	9842400	so which leads to the question
9842400	9844400	why don't you just say you're an adult
9844400	9846400	if you're a minor
9846400	9848400	save the fee and the hassle
9848400	9851400	which I'm sure most people will probably do
9851400	9853400	I wonder if that's a permanent thing
9853400	9855400	because stuff like that is usually
9855400	9858400	because Loki Reggie doesn't like liars
9858400	9860400	oh yeah I'm sure
9860400	9862400	all those kids too are very
9862400	9864400	you know they're very truthful
9864400	9866400	when it comes to those age gated videos as well
9866400	9868400	I'm sure no one says that they were born in like
9868400	9870400	the current date
9870400	9872400	or was it 1900
9872400	9874400	or something like that
9874400	9876400	when you go to xtube.com
9876400	9878400	sure I was January 1st 1900
9878400	9880400	yeah exactly
9880400	9882400	hey we gotta call on the line
9882400	9884400	Orange Lounge Radio who's this
9884400	9886400	Ron was back again
9886400	9888400	you again gotta go have a nice day
9888400	9890400	what's up buddy
9890400	9892400	not much um
9892400	9894400	you did bring Reggie to OLR
9894400	9896400	and ask him a really
9896400	9898400	dumb question and I mean that in like
9898400	9900400	a showgirls is dumb but I love it kind of way
9902400	9904400	so what's up buddy
9904400	9906400	something interesting
9906400	9908400	that happened with GameStop
9908400	9910400	and now with their current set of preorders
9910400	9912400	it seems that
9912400	9914400	my brother he went to preorder
9914400	9916400	his Wii paid off in full
9916400	9918400	he was going to have issues
9918400	9920400	picking it up because of work
9920400	9922400	and the store that's open
9922400	9924400	and the whole 48 hours thing
9924400	9926400	he was pretty much
9926400	9928400	told more or less that if he doesn't
9928400	9930400	pick it up in 48 hours
9930400	9932400	they're going to give it to somebody else
9934400	9936400	now it seems that
9936400	9938400	due to an issue with the
9938400	9940400	release of Assassin's Creed
9940400	9942400	it doesn't matter if
9942400	9944400	you preorder your game
9944400	9946400	or console and not paid in full or not
9946400	9948400	if somebody wants it
9948400	9950400	they can have it
9950400	9952400	well wait a minute he paid for it
9952400	9954400	in full already yes
9954400	9956400	but they're still threatening to give it away
9956400	9958400	isn't that give it away but
9958400	9960400	when he
9960400	9962400	can pick it up or whatever he'll get the
9962400	9964400	next one for like they're not
9964400	9966400	taking away his money right
9966400	9968400	no but the thing is
9968400	9970400	that
9970400	9972400	GameStop has now what's called no
9972400	9974400	person left behind
9974400	9976400	so that guarantees
9976400	9978400	even if you preorder it paid for it in
9978400	9980400	full if it's the last copy you're
9980400	9982400	coming to pick it up if someone beat
9982400	9984400	you by 10 minutes even though that's
9984400	9986400	your copy that
9986400	9988400	other person can walk out the store with it and you'll
9988400	9990400	have to wait till the next shipment and depending
9990400	9992400	on the game don't
9992400	9994400	know when it's coming then why are you
9994400	9996400	preordering
9996400	9998400	that's my point exactly
9998400	10000400	well yeah I mean I've never
10000400	10002400	been a big fan of the preorder system at all
10002400	10004400	I can't think of the last thing I preordered
10004400	10006400	and that's how I voice my
10006400	10008400	opinion I don't participate you didn't
10008400	10010400	preorder a Wii U I did not preorder a
10010400	10012400	Wii U I'm not sitting here going
10012400	10014400	nanny nanny poo poo I found one anyway
10014400	10016400	but I did find
10016400	10018400	one anyway
10018400	10020400	you know like it
10020400	10022400	could happen now you probably couldn't do it
10022400	10024400	now now that the day is over I don't think you're gonna find
10024400	10026400	one but they're
10026400	10028400	supposedly putting them out
10028400	10030400	more frequently but okay
10030400	10032400	I gotta go back to this so why
10032400	10034400	couldn't your friend get there within
10034400	10036400	48 hours?
10036400	10038400	my bro my brother sorry your brother
10038400	10040400	yeah his work schedule he
10040400	10042400	the game stopped he was able to pick it up but
10042400	10044400	today they will open
10044400	10046400	from 11 to 6 he works
10046400	10048400	11 to 7 and he's a 45
10048400	10050400	minute drive away
10050400	10052400	oh okay alright that makes
10052400	10054400	sense and especially with all the shenanigans
10054400	10056400	that have happened out there back east
10056400	10058400	I mean I'm sure they're still cleaning up some of the roads
10058400	10060400	oh
10060400	10062400	don't get me started about that
10062400	10064400	are they still rationing the gas and all that shit?
10064400	10066400	um and New York
10066400	10068400	City I think they still
10068400	10070400	are wow I'll have to double
10070400	10072400	check with that wow anyway
10072400	10074400	sorry didn't mean to change the topic on you
10074400	10076400	but um I do I
10076400	10078400	do feel like this isn't the first
10078400	10080400	I've heard of this policy I do
10080400	10082400	want to say GameStop has kind of done this before
10082400	10084400	where it's like well if you don't show up to get your stuff
10084400	10086400	we are going to give it to a customer
10086400	10088400	who's willing to you know show up and pay for it
10088400	10090400	I'm not saying it makes a right
10090400	10092400	I'm just saying I don't think this is necessarily
10092400	10094400	news
10094400	10096400	but when we're talking about
10096400	10098400	a $350 console that it's happening
10098400	10100400	with it does sting a hell of a
10100400	10102400	lot more than some $40
10102400	10104400	game exactly
10104400	10106400	stop shopping at GameStop I'm sorry
10106400	10108400	it had to be said you know well
10108400	10110400	absolutely correct this is why I shop at
10110400	10112400	Best Buy they give you at least two weeks to pick up
10112400	10114400	your stuff or
10114400	10116400	shit Walmart had that whole layaway
10116400	10118400	thing where you'd have till Christmas day to come
10118400	10120400	get it so you know
10120400	10122400	you got to look at the other options
10122400	10124400	exactly or targets where
10124400	10126400	I lucked out today did I talk
10126400	10128400	about that during the top of the show I used the target
10128400	10130400	app on iPhone to see because you can
10130400	10132400	check inventories and I saw that there was
10132400	10134400	one not my closest target
10134400	10136400	but the second closest one had had him in stock
10136400	10138400	now
10138400	10140400	I was discussing more
10140400	10142400	and that's because the argument with another person that
10142400	10144400	works at GameStop I said look
10144400	10146400	if I paid for my
10146400	10148400	Wii U in full
10148400	10150400	and when I get there
10150400	10152400	it's not there
10152400	10154400	that's theft
10154400	10156400	me personally at that point I
10156400	10158400	would want a full refund of what I paid
10158400	10160400	and I'm going somewhere else to pick up my console
10160400	10162400	now this other person is arguing
10162400	10164400	it's not theft because you're still going to get it
10164400	10166400	I'm like yes it is since you
10166400	10168400	pretty much guaranteed me
10168400	10170400	that last one belongs to me
10170400	10172400	and not nobody else
10172400	10174400	I think that's
10174400	10176400	rough
10176400	10178400	I can't make
10178400	10180400	a fairness claim because it's not
10180400	10182400	fair to anyone
10182400	10184400	it's nice that they will be willing to give
10184400	10186400	it up eventually
10186400	10188400	that they have
10188400	10190400	a window
10190400	10192400	I'm talking primarily Wii U right now
10192400	10194400	you said 48 hours
10194400	10196400	but it doesn't really cover what you were talking about
10196400	10198400	with Assassin's Creed 3
10198400	10200400	what I mean to say was because of
10200400	10202400	what happened with Assassin's Creed 3
10202400	10204400	people who pre-ordered didn't
10204400	10206400	get it because they went to other people
10206400	10208400	so an email came from corporate from that
10208400	10210400	no person left behind
10210400	10212400	doesn't matter about the 40 hour rule
10212400	10214400	it's no longer in effect
10214400	10216400	even though there's still some stores that are still doing it
10216400	10218400	let me go to a comment in our chat room
10218400	10220400	at live.vognetwork.com
10220400	10222400	Dungeon Buster says that 48 hours thing
10222400	10224400	has been with GameStop forever
10224400	10226400	particularly with products in demand
10226400	10228400	they'll promise the moon for pre-orders
10228400	10230400	but the inside policy is to move inventory
10230400	10232400	yeah that's exactly what it is
10232400	10234400	I get that from a business perspective
10234400	10236400	like I totally get that from a business
10236400	10238400	perspective but here's the question
10238400	10240400	that a lot of companies don't always
10240400	10242400	assess properly
10242400	10244400	at what customer service sacrifice
10244400	10246400	are you gonna
10246400	10248400	imply that
10248400	10250400	business perspective it's about finding balance
10250400	10252400	and GameStop's opinion
10252400	10254400	obviously at the price of 50
10254400	10256400	60 dollars GameStop can lose a few
10256400	10258400	customers and still make a profit at the same time
10258400	10260400	though they did just close 20 stores
10260400	10262400	so maybe they're not in the
10262400	10264400	best position to be turning people away but I
10264400	10266400	don't know at the same time
10266400	10268400	they pissed your brother off potentially
10268400	10270400	but they would have made someone else very happy
10270400	10272400	true so
10272400	10274400	I'm not again I'm not saying it's right I'm just
10274400	10276400	trying to weigh the different
10276400	10278400	sides of it and look at the business perspective
10278400	10280400	alright and you're right cause
10280400	10282400	I worked retail for like 15 plus years
10282400	10284400	I mean I see the business side
10284400	10286400	of it I also see the customer
10286400	10288400	side of things if it was me personally
10288400	10290400	if I knew the person and
10290400	10292400	I would do my best to hold
10292400	10294400	it for them but if my manager's telling me
10294400	10296400	give it to the next person I'm giving it to
10296400	10298400	the next person cause between you and me my
10298400	10300400	job's a little more important than what that person on the other side
10300400	10302400	of the counter wants
10302400	10304400	here's my thing personally this is how I would
10304400	10306400	do it this is how I would do it is that
10306400	10308400	and I'm not GameStop but if I
10308400	10310400	I think the balance would be if that customer
10310400	10312400	calls within the first 48
10312400	10314400	hours and says hey
10314400	10316400	I want to come get my system but I
10316400	10318400	can't can I have an extension and
10318400	10320400	tell such and such reasonable time
10320400	10322400	reasonable being within you know
10322400	10324400	another 48 hours or whatever then
10324400	10326400	grant them the stinking extension
10326400	10328400	but if a person no call no shows
10328400	10330400	then give their shit away
10330400	10332400	I think that's a fair compromise
10332400	10334400	it is it is
10334400	10336400	but as you can see GameStop's all about
10336400	10338400	making that I mean
10338400	10340400	ShameStop's all about making that
10340400	10342400	green dollar buck
10342400	10344400	I don't know what I'm just some schmo with a podcast
10344400	10346400	I don't know what I'm talking about
10346400	10348400	I know right
10348400	10350400	alright well we gotta let you go
10350400	10352400	buddy but any quick final thoughts for us
10352400	10354400	no but stay fabulous

10380400	10382400	any other last minute stories or should I get some tweets
10384400	10386400	just kind of some random stuff Tom Hardy's
10386400	10388400	gonna be in the Splinter Cell movie
10388400	10390400	she mentioned that during Rapid Fire
10390400	10392400	oh I wasn't listening I just thought I'd mention again
10392400	10394400	Tom Hardy's awesome although I haven't yet
10394400	10396400	to see the last Batman movie
10396400	10398400	so me too I really mean to
10398400	10400400	or Avengers
10400400	10402400	the last I think I said this on the show already
10402400	10404400	the last Batman movie was great but Tom Hardy's
10404400	10406400	Bane it really creeped me out how he sounded like
10406400	10408400	Count Von Count or I think this
10408400	10410400	was mentioned I'm going to destroy Gotham City
10410400	10412400	yeah I think this was mentioned last week
10412400	10414400	he sounded Belgian to me
10414400	10416400	it was Alan if you've seen that
10416400	10418400	YouTube video series now they have
10418400	10420400	Tom Hardy reading the cans of
10420400	10422400	energy drink
10422400	10424400	no I haven't seen that you need to find
10424400	10426400	that it's hilarious Tom Hardy
10426400	10428400	is hot as hell well it's not Tom Hardy it's
10428400	10430400	Bane it's Tom Hardy's Bane reading the
10430400	10432400	one fish
10432400	10434400	two fish uh uh alright
10434400	10436400	we got another call coming in let's go to the phones
10436400	10438400	hi you are on OrangeLoungeRadio who's this
10440400	10442400	it's Amiga777
10442400	10444400	I'm sorry say that again you are a little
10444400	10446400	bit quiet
10446400	10448400	Amiga777
10448400	10450400	Amiga777 now I can hear you buddy
10450400	10452400	what's on your mind
10452400	10454400	basically
10454400	10456400	the Wii U
10456400	10458400	launch yes
10458400	10460400	I was
10460400	10462400	at last night I was out you know
10462400	10464400	just driving around saying
10464400	10466400	if there was anyone you know who might
10466400	10468400	have been camping you
10468400	10470400	know you know out in
10470400	10472400	anticipation or pre-orders
10472400	10474400	anything like that and
10474400	10476400	I couldn't find
10476400	10478400	really anybody it's like if they
10478400	10480400	were out there
10480400	10482400	they're probably just
10482400	10484400	parked in the cars instead of you know
10484400	10486400	out in the tents or
10486400	10488400	whatever you know I think a lot
10488400	10490400	more stores did pre-orders this
10490400	10492400	time which was very different from last time
10492400	10494400	in 2006
10494400	10496400	I remember because we drove around and
10496400	10498400	looked at all the lines and we participated
10498400	10500400	in a line at Target and there was
10500400	10502400	a line at Walmart there was a line at
10502400	10504400	Best Buy there was a line at Toys
10504400	10506400	Us there was a line at Circuit City
10506400	10508400	well we all know why there wasn't a line
10508400	10510400	there this year but
10510400	10512400	some of these other stores I named all with the
10512400	10514400	exception of Target they all did pre-orders
10514400	10516400	they didn't do them six years ago
10516400	10518400	but they do them now Best Buy did pre-orders
10518400	10520400	Walmart did pre-orders
10520400	10522400	Target did not do pre-orders
10522400	10524400	so if you were going to find a line that was probably the
10524400	10526400	place to be but I think
10526400	10528400	most people that were really
10528400	10530400	that rabbit about it probably got their
10530400	10532400	pre-order but I sure
10532400	10534400	did see some interesting tweets
10534400	10536400	and I you know again it's Twitter so take it with a
10536400	10538400	grain of salt but I saw somebody on Twitter
10538400	10540400	who said there was a line at Walmart
10540400	10542400	and the third person in line
10542400	10544400	bought all the remaining
10544400	10546400	we use and pissed everybody else
10546400	10548400	off in line because you know she was going to flip
10548400	10550400	them on eBay and actually
10550400	10552400	the clerk I had at Target
10552400	10554400	today said somebody tried to come in and do
10554400	10556400	the same thing and they said no because
10556400	10558400	they had a policy on these items to sell
10558400	10560400	only one and I said good because
10560400	10562400	you know those are just going to end up on eBay and he's like
10562400	10564400	yeah I can't he's like I don't
10564400	10566400	those they need to do something about those eBay flippers
10566400	10568400	I'm like hell yeah they do so
10568400	10570400	anyway sorry I got a little tangenty
10570400	10572400	but so you didn't find any lines
10572400	10574400	yeah
10574400	10576400	yeah I mean I was looking for
10576400	10578400	campers you know late at night you know just
10578400	10580400	waiting it's like
10580400	10582400	like where is everybody they all
10582400	10584400	went to New York City I thought this was
10584400	10586400	a big deal
10586400	10588400	and
10588400	10590400	I'm getting a text message correcting
10590400	10592400	me from somebody listening right now
10592400	10594400	but they did do pre-orders
10594400	10596400	at Target okay
10596400	10598400	well shit they didn't do enough then
10598400	10600400	I didn't realize they did apparently not to sell
10600400	10602400	out their first run stock yeah that's that's
10602400	10604400	weird they must have done them real late in the game because
10604400	10606400	I didn't see anything on the website or nothing but alright
10606400	10608400	I'll take his word for
10608400	10610400	it maybe
10610400	10612400	they didn't all do it too could have been certain
10612400	10614400	ones but anyway
10614400	10616400	maybe the time to have seen the line
10616400	10618400	would have been earlier today I don't know
10618400	10620400	but yeah it's kind of a bummer
10620400	10622400	the line thing didn't happen because there was a lot
10622400	10624400	of community that came with it like
10624400	10626400	Jamie I know you had a real fun time you know
10626400	10628400	well I don't know about like real fun but you had a
10628400	10630400	well enough time in the line
10630400	10632400	just kind of talking to people right yeah but it
10632400	10634400	did get kind of boring yeah
10634400	10636400	and then it got really sleepy at four
10636400	10638400	in the morning it starts to get old
10638400	10640400	oh and then there was the woman who showed up like after all of
10640400	10642400	us everyone who waited got a
10642400	10644400	wee the one woman who just showed
10644400	10646400	up at five in the morning no
10646400	10648400	aww five in the morning
10648400	10650400	still really early I walked in there at
10650400	10652400	ten thirty and got a Wii U today
10652400	10654400	alright Amiga enough about us
10654400	10656400	how about you you went around and
10656400	10658400	looked at all these lines is the Wii U
10658400	10660400	something you were interested in picking up
10660400	10662400	or no
10662400	10664400	kind of sorta you know just
10664400	10666400	really curious you know just
10666400	10668400	you know it's a new new system
10668400	10670400	from Nintendo and
10670400	10672400	I was just hearing a lot about it
10672400	10674400	currently
10674400	10676400	you know don't quite have the
10676400	10678400	funds to get one of my own
10678400	10680400	at this time but you know
10680400	10682400	I was
10682400	10684400	taking with all the
10684400	10686400	hype behind it you know
10686400	10688400	and Reggie sees me being on
10688400	10690400	Late Night with Jimmy Fallon
10690400	10692400	a couple nights ago
10692400	10694400	I thought
10694400	10696400	I was gonna be seeing a lot of
10696400	10698400	avid fans
10698400	10700400	of Nintendo
10700400	10702400	I guess instead
10702400	10704400	I think I
10704400	10706400	saw it as Nintendo just
10706400	10708400	probably just planning
10708400	10710400	a light launch or something
10710400	10712400	like that then
10712400	10714400	and I think me and maybe others
10714400	10716400	might have anticipated
10716400	10718400	maybe it's something that will really
10718400	10720400	start to gear up through 2013
10720400	10722400	oh yeah you do talk about the light launch
10722400	10724400	and we don't we didn't see a lot of commercials
10724400	10726400	this year either I mean there was
10726400	10728400	like the occasional movie screen commercial that
10728400	10730400	I caught but like there's not really
10730400	10732400	been the TV commercials or that whole like
10732400	10734400	what they did last time with the we
10734400	10736400	would like to play I think
10736400	10738400	and I heard this theory on Bobby's show
10738400	10740400	and it seems
10740400	10742400	perfectly reasonable to me they're just
10742400	10744400	saving all that money to market them next year
10744400	10746400	after Christmas makes sense to me
10746400	10748400	or after Thanksgiving
10748400	10750400	the bigger holiday rush either or
10750400	10752400	but just why blow all the money
10752400	10754400	now when all your pre-orders sold out
10754400	10756400	who do you have to advertise to let the word
10756400	10758400	of mouth do its thing
10758400	10760400	very very true
10760400	10762400	very true alright Amiga77
10762400	10764400	I hope you're able to get one if you want one
10764400	10766400	hopefully maybe a luck will
10766400	10768400	turn around around the holidays but thanks
10768400	10770400	so much for calling the show alright
10770400	10772400	alright alright take care buddy
10772400	10774400	yep bye bye
10774400	10776400	thanks to
10776400	10778400	the call I haven't heard from him in a long time
10778400	10780400	appreciate hearing from some
10780400	10782400	callers we don't hear from all the time
10782400	10784400	Tigerclaw in chat says I haven't seen
10784400	10786400	any Wii U commercials I only see a lot of
10786400	10788400	commercials for that Red Dawn remake
10788400	10790400	which apparently according to the
10790400	10792400	commercial always got a lot of good reviews
10792400	10794400	ok here's the thing
10794400	10796400	there are so many movie critics
10796400	10798400	that'll say good things about any
10798400	10800400	fucking movie just to be in the commercial
10800400	10802400	and gain their own cred believe it
10802400	10804400	for the record
10804400	10806400	I'm sorry Red Dawn
10806400	10808400	was a movie in the 80's it was
10808400	10810400	that's the only thing I have to say about that
10810400	10812400	and they're remaking it because you know it's so
10812400	10814400	topical I kind of want to see the sequel
10814400	10816400	or the second one or the remake or whatever
10816400	10818400	I kind of want to see it
10818400	10820400	because it looks kind of cool
10820400	10822400	I just want the scene where the girl's dead
10822400	10824400	and she has the grenade on her and they find her and they
10824400	10826400	blow up I'm not like you know
10826400	10828400	I don't think it's going to be better than the original
10828400	10830400	or anything like that it's just going to be it's just a movie
10830400	10832400	whatever it's just a dumb popcorn
10832400	10834400	flick exactly it is a dumb
10834400	10836400	popcorn flick and
10836400	10838400	there's been a lot of dumb popcorn flicks that
10838400	10840400	have come out like you know dread
10840400	10842400	ended up being really good so
10842400	10844400	Dread was amazingly
10844400	10846400	good oh man that's it's funny
10846400	10848400	to say that's the last movie that I saw
10848400	10850400	I've missed Avengers I've missed
10850400	10852400	Prometheus I've missed I haven't seen
10852400	10854400	Wreck-It Ralph yet I want to see Skyfall I want to see
10854400	10856400	all of those for some reason I just don't see
10856400	10858400	movies enough but I was out when I was
10858400	10860400	out in New Mexico I saw Dread with some friends of mine
10860400	10862400	oh man knew nothing about it
10862400	10864400	going in other than Judge Dread and
10864400	10866400	completely worth it I used to have the pinball table
10866400	10868400	I don't know if I played
10868400	10870400	that one alright okay if anybody
10870400	10872400	else wants to call I can squeeze in one other quick
10872400	10874400	call 1877 game OLR or
10874400	10876400	username on Skype orange launch radio
10876400	10878400	any other last minute stories I still have some Twitter topics
10878400	10880400	to do but yeah
10880400	10882400	as we kind of mentioned a little bit
10882400	10884400	your Nintendo network account
10884400	10886400	is tied to your Wii U so if it
10886400	10888400	breaks I guess you've
10888400	10890400	ever sent it to Nintendo because I'm sure they can
10890400	10892400	transfer it to a new system but
10892400	10894400	if you try to go buy a new system
10894400	10896400	you're fucked so
10896400	10898400	just saying I'm giving
10898400	10900400	Nintendo the benefit of the doubt here that they
10900400	10902400	just haven't implemented that yet I hope
10902400	10904400	I hope I'm thinking that it's something
10904400	10906400	that a consumer can't
10906400	10908400	just go buy a new system that they have
10908400	10910400	to send it in Nintendo for a repair and
10910400	10912400	then they can do the transfer because that's how
10912400	10914400	it was with the Wii how do you get all your Wii
10914400	10916400	or Wii virtual console
10916400	10918400	crap transferred over that they would have to
10918400	10920400	do it and then of course somebody
10920400	10922400	accidentally found a way to get into the
10922400	10924400	dev stuff for
10924400	10926400	or the debug menu for the Wii U
10926400	10928400	thing and then there
10928400	10930400	was another one that someone put that somehow
10930400	10932400	they got into the debug thing
10932400	10934400	for the Wii U Miiverse but I think that's
10934400	10936400	photoshopped so
10936400	10938400	not going to say anything about that
10938400	10940400	but yeah the debug menu though on the
10940400	10942400	actual system I can believe that
10942400	10944400	alright let me do some
10944400	10946400	Twitter topics real quick Tigerclaw sent
10946400	10948400	in a few he also sent in the 50 cents
10948400	10950400	miners thing and the one you
10950400	10952400	just talked about
10952400	10954400	so I want to tip the hat to Tigerclaw
10954400	10956400	because he did send one other that neither
10956400	10958400	of us have hit on yet
10958400	10960400	video game industry companies getting
10960400	10962400	recognition in other areas
10962400	10964400	the human rights campaign
10964400	10966400	which champions a lot of LGBT
10966400	10968400	causes which you know
10968400	10970400	obviously huge huge month for
10970400	10972400	them with the elections
10972400	10974400	Microsoft and EA were recognized
10974400	10976400	as best places to work
10976400	10978400	for LGBT equality
10978400	10980400	and I love that the picture
10980400	10982400	on this article is
10982400	10984400	Kaiden and ManShepherd
10984400	10986400	from Mass Effect 3 which is a great example
10986400	10988400	from EA's universe
10988400	10990400	I'm telling you I don't
10990400	10992400	care how it makes me sound that's
10992400	10994400	the reason I played Mass Effect I was like
10994400	10996400	alright I do need to play Mass Effect I got to
10996400	10998400	see what this is all about
10998400	11000400	I was not disappointed but there's something
11000400	11002400	in it for everybody
11002400	11004400	and I know Microsoft
11004400	11006400	has always got kudos to this I saw
11006400	11008400	there was like an official Microsoft gamer
11008400	11010400	con video that they did and you know
11010400	11012400	I know they've always been pretty good too with this
11012400	11014400	stuff so good for them
11014400	11016400	the 2013 corporate equality
11016400	11018400	index is the national benchmarking tool
11018400	11020400	on corporate policies this is according
11020400	11022400	to the official website and
11022400	11024400	EA's chief talent officer
11024400	11026400	Gabriel Toledano
11026400	11028400	I am very pleased that EA has scored
11028400	11030400	100% rating and has been recognized by the
11030400	11032400	human rights campaign in a year where the
11032400	11034400	company has taken significant steps to remain
11034400	11036400	inclusive EA has made changes
11036400	11038400	to our medical benefits been involved
11038400	11040400	in LGBT events in our community and
11040400	11042400	taken a public stance against the Defense of Marriage
11042400	11044400	Act EA champions diversity
11044400	11046400	with a work environment where everyone feels welcome
11046400	11048400	and can be themselves
11048400	11050400	you know I sometimes forget
11050400	11052400	that like I have Alan on my
11052400	11054400	medical insurance because you know we've been together
11054400	11056400	long enough that it's basically whether we're
11056400	11058400	legally recognized or not it's like a
11058400	11060400	common law partnership at this thing I can
11060400	11062400	put him on my benefits no problem because you
11062400	11064400	know I'm in California and I work for a health insurance
11064400	11066400	company that recognizes that stuff I sometimes
11066400	11068400	forget like not everybody's that lucky
11068400	11070400	he just blows my
11070400	11072400	mind
11072400	11074400	I had one more last minute story please

11128400	11130400	have next year we'll see we'll see
11130400	11132400	I'm not disappointed
11132400	11134400	uh Spazinator
11134400	11136400	PSN tweets us
11136400	11138400	random question if you three
11138400	11140400	could only pick one to play
11140400	11142400	which would you pick I'm
11142400	11144400	gonna say you four cause he didn't know maybe
11144400	11146400	that Jason was gonna be here tonight which would you pick
11146400	11148400	PC gaming
11148400	11150400	or console and
11150400	11152400	why so you only get one
11152400	11154400	or the other ever again
11154400	11156400	PC gaming or console and why
11156400	11158400	PC why practically everything
11158400	11160400	that I want to play on the console is on the PC
11160400	11162400	I can hook up a controller
11162400	11164400	to the PC and play it as it was a
11164400	11166400	console game plus I've got a whole bunch of other
11166400	11168400	games that were made specifically for PC
11168400	11170400	so it really expands my repertoire plus
11170400	11172400	I have emulators
11172400	11174400	for classic games
11174400	11176400	so technically I could also play
11176400	11178400	console games on my PC
11178400	11180400	with the right emulator
11180400	11182400	Loki PC because
11182400	11184400	it's an open platform versus a closed
11184400	11186400	platform that is on consoles
11186400	11188400	and also as Jamie mentioned
11188400	11190400	you can hook up a controller I mean
11190400	11192400	Xbox 360 controllers pretty much work with a lot of games
11192400	11194400	out there and well and it's
11194400	11196400	basically just like playing on a console hell I played
11196400	11198400	Crysis with an Xbox 360 controller
11198400	11200400	like it was a console game and
11200400	11202400	it was fine I played DC
11202400	11204400	Universe with an Xbox 360 controller
11204400	11206400	and it worked really well
11206400	11208400	Jason
11208400	11210400	Console gaming because if there were
11210400	11212400	a computer I have
11212400	11214400	completely admittedly
11214400	11216400	the library of games I want to play would not be
11216400	11218400	on the platform
11218400	11220400	because I'm sure
11220400	11222400	people who care will understand that
11222400	11224400	I'm gonna go
11224400	11226400	with PC as well and I think
11226400	11228400	for most of the same reasons as Jamie
11228400	11230400	it's not
11230400	11232400	that I necessarily prefer
11232400	11234400	PC over console I mean
11234400	11236400	they have their perks but
11236400	11238400	there are some games on PC that just are
11238400	11240400	never gonna happen on the console like Civ
11240400	11242400	Civ V not gonna happen
11242400	11244400	Typing of the Dead World of Warcraft
11244400	11246400	hello that's like the game I play
11246400	11248400	more than anything that's
11248400	11250400	you know PC only and
11250400	11252400	I was gonna say
11252400	11254400	the bit about emulators but she took the words out
11254400	11256400	of my mouth is that most of the classics you can
11256400	11258400	still get on PC whether
11258400	11260400	you know Spazinator would consider that
11260400	11262400	cheating or not I guess
11262400	11264400	is to be seen but I would say PC
11264400	11266400	gaming so
11266400	11268400	alright that's it for Twitter how about
11268400	11270400	anything else with
11270400	11272400	last minute stories Loki
11272400	11274400	no got
11274400	11276400	nothing oh we got one more call
11276400	11278400	coming in I was just about to click the button to
11278400	11280400	close it but we have one more call coming in and sure
11280400	11282400	we'll take it hi you're on Orange Launch Radio who's
11282400	11284400	this
11284400	11286400	what
11286400	11288400	it's Strlock hey Strlock what's on your mind
11288400	11290400	buddy
11290400	11292400	um yeah not too much
11292400	11294400	um
11294400	11296400	been checking out
11296400	11298400	Wii U stuff
11298400	11300400	all day it seems pretty cool
11300400	11302400	yeah
11302400	11304400	um
11304400	11306400	I don't know I'm liking the whole
11306400	11308400	um
11308400	11310400	tablet thing and not
11310400	11312400	needing the TV on
11312400	11314400	if you don't even want to
11314400	11316400	feel like doing that
11316400	11318400	try to tell us a little bit like
11318400	11320400	you know I know that you are a listener of
11320400	11322400	ours who is blind and I
11322400	11324400	know you're very passionate about like that community
11324400	11326400	with obvious reasons of course
11326400	11328400	but tell us a little bit about
11328400	11330400	what maybe we're not all thinking about
11330400	11332400	when it comes to assessing this
11332400	11334400	new platform like what
11334400	11336400	accessibility features
11336400	11338400	does the Wii U really need to have for it
11338400	11340400	to be a console that you can sit here
11340400	11342400	and say I enjoy this
11342400	11344400	um well first of all
11344400	11346400	good games
11346400	11348400	that I care about and really
11348400	11350400	as it stands right now I don't think there's a whole lot
11350400	11352400	just like
11352400	11354400	how like the um
11354400	11356400	the Vita
11356400	11358400	kind of was you know it didn't really have
11358400	11360400	much starting
11360400	11362400	and it's slowly getting more and more games
11362400	11364400	that I care about
11364400	11366400	but um
11366400	11368400	what I like is I guess
11368400	11370400	the tablet actually does have a headphone
11370400	11372400	jack in it
11372400	11374400	so um
11374400	11376400	that's kind of cool um
11376400	11378400	obviously
11378400	11380400	um my big thing is
11380400	11382400	being able to use the
11382400	11384400	freaking buttons
11384400	11386400	you know for the menus
11386400	11388400	I honestly haven't explored that to see if that's a possibility
11388400	11390400	I um I've heard that
11390400	11392400	yeah you can for at least most things
11392400	11394400	woohoo so that's good
11394400	11396400	um I don't know if you caught my comment
11396400	11398400	earlier in the show but one of the things I really
11398400	11400400	love about the Wii U is the whole fact
11400400	11402400	that the sound on the TV
11402400	11404400	and the sound coming out
11404400	11406400	of the gamepad will
11406400	11408400	really compliment each other and I'm
11408400	11410400	not just talking about like the incidentals like we
11410400	11412400	were used to hearing with the Wii like
11412400	11414400	you know the little Wii mote would make sounds
11414400	11416400	once in a while but like the Wii U
11416400	11418400	full on like a musical soundtrack
11418400	11420400	will play out of the gamepad that compliments what's
11420400	11422400	going on on the TV and it creates
11422400	11424400	this sound experience that
11424400	11426400	no other console really has right now
11426400	11428400	I heard with Zombie U
11428400	11430400	um your radio
11430400	11432400	transmissions
11432400	11434400	like the stuff that you're getting
11434400	11436400	through you know your radio actually comes out
11436400	11438400	of the tablet which is
11438400	11440400	pretty neat yes and uh Batman
11440400	11442400	Arkham City does something similar if you are
11442400	11444400	close to the person you'll hear it from the
11444400	11446400	TV if you're far away you'll hear
11446400	11448400	it on the tablet oh that
11448400	11450400	is cool yeah yeah yeah that's very
11450400	11452400	cool um now what I'm curious about
11452400	11454400	is I wonder like
11454400	11456400	if
11456400	11458400	all of the game audio like
11458400	11460400	say if you have your
11460400	11462400	TV doing
11462400	11464400	something else and
11464400	11466400	you're just using the controller
11466400	11468400	I wonder if uh all of your game
11468400	11470400	audio is going to be uh
11470400	11472400	streamed as well or if it's just gonna be
11472400	11474400	the incidentals that's what
11474400	11476400	I'm curious about I think it depends on the game
11476400	11478400	yeah I was I would have to say I would have
11478400	11480400	to if I would have to take an educated guess
11480400	11482400	can uh Rob was playing Mario
11482400	11484400	and it was the the
11484400	11486400	gamepad experience versus the TV was
11486400	11488400	identical um I would
11488400	11490400	assume that when headphones are in there I didn't
11490400	11492400	I didn't really hear anything coming
11492400	11494400	the music was not identical because they
11494400	11496400	were complimenting each other but most
11496400	11498400	of the sound effects see you probably couldn't hear it all
11498400	11500400	the way back here because you're just hearing
11500400	11502400	all the sound from the side of the room but when you're sitting
11502400	11504400	right there you hear it it's really
11504400	11506400	cool the two things the two things
11506400	11508400	to consider really really quick with that is that one
11508400	11510400	it may it may become smarter when
11510400	11512400	it sees that headphones are plugged in
11512400	11514400	that's what I was thinking yeah and second
11514400	11516400	there are options on like when you were doing
11516400	11518400	the chat there's options to shut off
11518400	11520400	the TV so maybe when it knows one
11520400	11522400	medium is gone it brings everything to the
11522400	11524400	gamepad that's true yeah
11524400	11526400	also I wanted to bring up word of caution
11526400	11528400	for those that um
11528400	11530400	are big fans of
11530400	11532400	uh Super Smash Brothers
11532400	11534400	Brawl with um
11534400	11536400	particularly with the GameCube
11536400	11538400	controls
11538400	11540400	um don't get rid of your Wii
11541400	11543400	cause Wii U doesn't have GameCube ports
11543400	11545400	oh that's a very good point
11545400	11547400	there are no ports
11547400	11549400	and general consensus from
11549400	11551400	many many people that I've seen
11551400	11553400	is GameCube
11553400	11555400	controllers kind of the best way to play Brawl
11555400	11557400	what about the pro controller
11557400	11559400	oh I guess maybe it wouldn't work
11559400	11561400	that wouldn't work with Brawl though
11561400	11563400	yikes
11563400	11565400	they need to bring back
11565400	11567400	bring back the wave bird
11567400	11569400	no shit the wave bird was
11569400	11571400	the only thing the wave bird was missing was rumble
11571400	11573400	that would have been
11573400	11575400	that would have made it perfect
11575400	11577400	but that is probably
11577400	11579400	one of my favorite controllers
11579400	11581400	still it was a good
11581400	11583400	good controller but I think it's nice
11583400	11585400	and sturdy and just
11585400	11587400	I have my collection of
11587400	11589400	wave birds
11589400	11591400	I do actually have four wave birds
11591400	11593400	one of them is an E3
11593400	11595400	wave bird nice
11595400	11597400	that my friend sold me
11597400	11599400	alright sirlock I gotta let you go so we can wrap up
11599400	11601400	but any other comments before we let you go
11601400	11603400	um
11603400	11605400	that has nothing to do with games
11605400	11607400	but um
11607400	11609400	swear to god
11609400	11611400	saw a I don't know if it's still there
11611400	11613400	but there was
11613400	11615400	a single box of
11615400	11617400	Twinkies on eBay
11617400	11619400	with a buy it now of ten thousand
11619400	11621400	dollars I'm not kidding
11621400	11623400	fucking ridiculous
11623400	11625400	I know right
11625400	11627400	they're gold plated
11627400	11629400	you know all that shit's gonna be bought out
11629400	11631400	don't
11631400	11633400	we'll be fine
11633400	11635400	Twinkies aren't even that good anyway
11635400	11637400	shit my thing is ding dongs
11637400	11639400	little Debbie's strawberry shortcakes are the bomb
11639400	11641400	nutty bars
11641400	11643400	nutty bars are pretty fucking good too
11643400	11645400	we have two Weird Al references with hostess products
11645400	11647400	ding dong man ding dong
11647400	11649400	ding dong yo
11649400	11651400	and
11651400	11653400	the Twinkie wiener sandwich
11653400	11655400	yes
11655400	11657400	the only Twinkie that I accept
11657400	11659400	is a deep fried Twinkie
11659400	11661400	I only could eat half of one
11661400	11663400	when we did those at the tourney
11663400	11665400	I don't know that just sounds like
11665400	11667400	a part of DDR's history in Sacramento
11667400	11669400	has died
11669400	11671400	because we had the only
11671400	11673400	DDR tournament ever to sell
11673400	11675400	deep fried Twinkies
11675400	11677400	why?
11677400	11679400	why the fuck not bitch
11679400	11681400	distinguishing factor you have there
11681400	11683400	dude in Sacramento
11683400	11685400	we did it fucked up
11685400	11687400	because our first tournament was
11687400	11689400	scat Sacramento
11689400	11691400	cosplay and tournament
11691400	11693400	yes
11693400	11695400	and it was
11695400	11697400	great
11697400	11699400	there was a NES game
11699400	11701400	called scat
11701400	11703400	yes there was
11703400	11705400	it was a damn good game
11705400	11707400	well I gotta give this call the
11707400	11709400	shaft as in Sacramento hosts another fabulous
11709400	11711400	tournament and say
11711400	11713400	goodnight so take care of Sturlock
11713400	11715400	see ya
11715400	11717400	we had the best acronyms for our I mean like nobody
11717400	11719400	could top that in the DRC
11719400	11721400	yeah we were awesome
11721400	11723400	even though everybody in the bay area hated Sacramento
11723400	11725400	but nah that was mostly one or two
