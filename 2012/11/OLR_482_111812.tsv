13973	25849	Tonight, November 18th, 2012, the Wii U launches in North America, loyal Microsoft users are rewarded with a free Xbox 360, and PlayStation Plus is set to debut on the Vita.
31457	36880	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	39642	It is Orange Lounge Radio.
40102	46686	My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle with my buddies.
47026	49348	Say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
49687	49967	Hi.
50347	50947	Hi, how are you?
51908	53168	I'm sick of donuts.
54429	54909	Oh, God.
55489	56810	Not the hostess thing.
57070	59091	Were you one of those people clearing out 7-Eleven?
59431	59671	No.
59911	61071	No, actually not at all.
61231	63572	I was watching Under Sedation Live last night.
63592	64833	Oh.
67017	95699	And they were eating, well Travis was eating Ding Dongs, Twinkies, all kinds of stuff And all of a sudden I wanted donuts And this Martin Funnel around the corner from my house had them So I bought ten of them and gave a pack to a homeless guy And the rest of them are now in my fridge at home So should I have the urge to eat a donut Which I really shouldn't be because wheat makes me sick But I have them now I ate a pack today, I wish I hadn't
96593	112973	Here's the thing, like, you know, I'm not going to get into the whole why about it, but I'm going to tell you why the closure pisses me off is because Hostess also makes, and I don't know if this is a nationwide thing, it might be a regional thing, but they make this bread called Columbo bread, which is like the sourdough bread that is so flipping good.
112993	114274	Columbo is its own brand.
115003	115884	Right, but it's part of Hostess.
115944	117945	I know, right, but Columbo also makes frozen yogurt.
118325	118665	Oh, okay.
119005	127250	Columbo also makes a bunch of other baked goods, but they also do... Because it used to be a major competitor for the company that my dad used to work for.
128711	131133	My dad used to work for a distributor called W.J.
131153	133914	Powell Company, and they did a different bread for their supplier.
134335	137957	Columbo was one of the big southern competitors.
138690	139971	Oh, I always thought they were based out here.
141092	142553	Because San Francisco is sourdough bread.
143294	146096	Yeah, but they also do other kinds of breads.
146216	147617	It's a national bread company.
147998	151561	And they also do frozen yogurt and other, what's the word I'm thinking of?
152101	153122	Mass distribution foods.
153262	158606	Well, my point was, I'm not going to be able to get that sourdough bread anymore, at least until somebody buys the company or whatever.
158626	160268	Well, you can go to fucking Boudin and get good bread.
160288	160728	Yeah.
162025	163786	But I love Columbo bread, you shut up.
164246	166507	Also, say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.
166927	171210	I completely was ignoring everything you guys were talking about for the last minute or two.
171310	174011	Hostess, you don't have an opinion on Twinkies?
174271	175412	I don't like them.
176312	180314	I think people are going way too crazy over this, but it's because everybody remembers them from a kid.
180794	186857	I don't know about you guys, but a Twinkie was like a staple dessert that came with your little bag lunch.
187378	188958	Holy crap, it's cake with frosting inside.
188998	189779	Ours were Star Crunch.
190679	194061	Wow, no one will ever be able to do that.
194802	195622	Well, Little Debbie.
196383	199605	If you eat Little Debbie stuff, strawberry shortcakes are superior.
199645	200325	No, no, no.
200885	203007	It's all about oat milk cream pies.
203027	211572	I don't know if they actually had a hostess end cap or whatever at our local grocery store, and now that's all Little Debbie stuff now.
211712	213093	They just completely removed it all.
213313	216075	I don't know if they had to return it all before their...
218796	222398	Little Debbie was probably the one that, you know, convinced them all to join the union and all that.
222438	222758	No, I'm kidding.
222778	223218	I'm kidding.
223498	224038	I don't want to go there.
224058	224258	All right.
224639	229261	Also say hello to the one, the only, Jason is joining us in the studio tonight.
229421	230521	Hello again, everybody.
230781	234643	Mr. VX, Jason X, VX, YZ, QR, STUP.
234963	235663	Yeah.
235683	236384	Hey, for me.
236604	237224	How you doing?
238905	243707	I'm tired from zipping south of San Francisco and north of San Francisco and...
244387	246929	Train for much too long as usual.
247469	248810	But I'm here, so why not?
249030	250791	And commuting back and forth from Colorado.
251112	251452	Uh-huh.
252372	256735	Which, by the way, being that you... See, politics is pretty bad here.
257696	260037	Because, you know, it's bad everywhere.
260077	261858	But at least we're not a swing state.
262159	264020	Everybody knew how California was going to vote.
264080	264340	Oh, yeah.
264500	269563	Your state, on the other hand, oh my god, you must be really fucking sick of politics.
269663	270324	And this is... I...
272225	273165	Not watching TV.
273766	282649	The only exposure to politics that I had was every once in a while that Facebook, either a sponsored post or a friend liking something that shows up on my feed.
283069	284569	It was surprisingly minimal.
285290	288751	I didn't get too much of it, and I could very easily just skim the sponsored posts.
290112	299916	But the one thing that I did get is YouTube partner channels, the ones that actually monetize their channel, politic two-minute political ads every single video.
300437	307500	And there have been a couple of gaming shows, The Continue Show, Game Grumps, and then individually Jon, Sean, and Egoraptor.
307860	310662	I've been watching a ton of their videos, and they all monetize.
311022	316925	So the start of every episode, the end of every episode, for whatever reason, even though you can just skip it,
317485	323330	and the middle of particularly long episodes, political ad, political ad, political ad, political ad, political ad.
323871	327474	So it wasn't terribly specific for my region, but it still sucked.
327574	332518	This is why you don't see Wii U commercials anywhere because the politicians bought up all the ad space.
332538	333239	Yeah, they really did.
333279	333679	There it is.
334200	337923	My fun trivia about politics, since we're on the subject to get it out of the way...
338643	341445	How many presidential candidates were on the Colorado ballot?
341465	341686	How many?
341726	341966	Sixteen.
365723	366023	Wow.
366223	366644	Yeah.
367284	376231	I don't know if it was sarcastic, but somebody told me that the only thing you have to do to get on the ballot is to have some kind of party application.
376251	378552	You have to have some kind of a political party and pay $500.
378852	386418	Now, okay, I'm not going to ask you how you voted in elections because that's a touchy subject and whatever, but also I do want to remind everybody.
386678	388400	Duke Nukem says don't fuck with Roseanne
409998	417908	I'm not going to ask about the big one because that's still got a lot of ruffled feathers and so forth, but I gotta know.
419110	419851	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
442794	446295	I actually eat all that snacky food because I'm just a fat pig.
446415	448455	Like, I'm not even smoking weed.
448495	449195	I'm just a fat pig.
449615	452816	But how do you feel about all that, being in that state?
452936	464478	The best thing that's come out of this is the humor on Facebook and the local communities because of how many people I follow that live in the area go figure that the jokes, the pictures, the memes, they are actually pretty damn funny.
464618	467579	Getting high while you are actually high in the Mile High City?
469300	470401	That's a new one to me, actually.
470421	472383	I just like the one of the fog rolling in.
472623	473363	Yes, yes.
473764	474884	Suddenly in Colorado.
476085	486093	Well, my favorite as well is the whole fact that it's a fucking cruel joke that Hostess closes the week after they legalize marijuana in two states.
486133	489836	And it's like, what kind of fucking stupid business decision was that?
491449	494191	You own Twinkies.
494231	495913	You were sitting on a gold mine.
496594	504442	They were too busy giving themselves raises and not worrying about things like benefits and pensions.
504722	506464	Fucking greedy ass fuckers.
506604	520788	But since we're all under the age of 50, I'm sure we can agree that yay to those states that finally voted the right way and either legalized or stopped the banning of marriage and all that.
520928	522768	So yay to Washington and all that.
522908	528470	It makes it more difficult because we have to watch out for state officials.
528750	533651	We don't have to watch out for state officials, but when we hear about a federal raid, then it becomes a little bit more dangerous because...
534271	538814	As the disclaimer goes, it is still illegal at the federal level, which ultimately supersedes state law.
539775	540055	All right.
540115	541656	Anyhow, we got to get to video games.
541696	543177	It's been a busy week in video games.
543217	544318	We're getting too political.
545239	545559	Shut up.
545599	546760	Don't talk about politics.
546860	548101	I tuned in to hear about games.
548581	548941	Fine.
549302	550462	We can talk games.
550903	556066	Let's talk about Wii U. Obviously, Wii U. Yeah, everybody's heard that joke.
556466	561390	But in part to Bobby, who does the show before us every week.
561890	563352	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
578557	579938	DarkSakura, did you buy the Wii U?
580138	580779	I'm not a whore.
581879	584021	So that means it's between Loki and myself.
584101	587283	Now, Loki, you do work for the distribution company.
587563	589064	I do work for the distribution company.
589124	593167	And you've been shading the shit out of Nintendo on the past few episodes of the show.
593367	593907	That's true.
594027	596509	Did you have a change of heart and did you buy a Wii U?
597249	598270	No, I already own a Wii.
599665	600466	Yes, it was me.
600626	601988	I bought the Wii U this morning.
602008	602568	Surprise.
602628	603329	I did, yep.
604891	606693	So let's talk about the Wii U a little bit.
606833	609516	I guess I'll start since, you know, I actually have one.
610017	610878	No, here's the thing.
611439	614222	I went back and forth on that Wii U thing a lot.
614782	616424	I made a very cryptic tweet last night.
617285	618825	Talking about, because here's the thing.
619166	628828	I chose not to go out and stand in line and all that stuff for the Wii U last night because Irene, who a lot of you old school OLR listeners know because she used to be on the show all the time.
629328	634230	Irene was visiting and I make it sound like she doesn't live here, but she came over.
634310	635370	We went out for her birthday.
635710	640311	So I chose to go get drunk at a gay bar rather than go stand out in line.
640511	641672	I think I made the right decision.
642472	644574	So I pretty much convinced myself, you know what?
644654	646435	I don't need a Wii U. I'm not going to get one.
646695	647276	I'm over it.
647556	649137	You know, I'll get one in January or whatever.
649798	655922	And then this morning, I fire up the Target app and I just look out of curiosity.
656382	657443	It's like 11 o'clock.
658769	687155	they're still in stock at the store nearby let's just go take a look walk out of there with my Wii U Deluxe set not only are you a whore I found one at noon still on a shelf in Target not only are you a whore, you're a waffling whore so they're not sold out like the Wii oh I guess they probably are now to be fair because there were two left and I bought one see Nintendo, Apple helps you sell your stuff if you're going to pick any mobile platform Apple
687795	689756	I'm sure that isn't a surprise to hear me say, ever.
690156	701643	So to be honest, I've only really been able to spend like 30 minutes playing actual games on the console because as I'm sure you all heard, there's that massive 5GB update and that took an hour out and I had to do other stuff to prep for the show.
702003	705565	So I didn't have a whole lot of time to really sit down with the Wii U, but I'm going to tell you like this.
706205	711128	This is the impression I got of the Wii U with the little time I had playing it.
711548	713071	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
723596	725598	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
748917	749797	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
772822	773363	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
788360	788861	All that stuff.
788881	803493	There's a reason I have DarkSakura tell that story because that's how I kind of feel about the Wii U is that like there's these doors that you'll open and there's a wall there and there'll be like a half-finished tunnel and it's like, oh, you can click on Amazon Prime and then it's like, surprise, it's fucking nothing.
803974	804895	You know, like that gif.
805235	812261	It's like there's all these weird unfinished things and I really feel like so much of the infrastructure they're building as they go along.
812481	812681	Like,
813402	815385	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
829424	830926	I also really love the subtle touch.
848068	849069	It's a neat little thing.
849089	849950	I like that.
867734	871497	So yes, Loki, I know you're dying to comment on my consumer whoredom, so please.
871677	876241	No, I'm just saying that I don't know why you're surprised that there's stuff that's not finished for the Wii U launch.
876261	879863	They did the same thing with the Wii, the DS, the 3DS.
880084	885628	It's just Nintendo, and they're... Well, we want people to buy our stuff, but oh hey, it's not complete.
887506	891030	You know, all those wonderful features that we were pimping out during our E3 conferences.
891090	892131	Hey, TV!
892391	893092	Nintendo TV.
893472	894273	Nope, not fucking there.
895034	896255	Oh, hey, Rayman Legends.
896335	897476	Really awesome launch game.
897636	898237	Launch window.
898437	900980	By launch window, he means coming out five months later.
902648	903489	I mean, come on!
928829	929990	Your typical pack-in game.
930831	935415	I only did a little bit of Nintendo Land, but I like some of the variety in some of the games.
935495	941080	I don't think it's Wii Sports level going to draw people in, but I think it's a neat way to show off the console.
942661	948286	I did a video chat too with Shane, and it's okay.
948467	950849	I mean, the quality is kind of comparable to FaceTime.
951489	976859	it's a little slow to connect and then like it does this really weird transition thing when you connect to the other person where it like ripples in and it plays like this music like like it's like this big debut like oh my god I'm gonna video chat like ta-da and then like oh hey it's Shane like I haven't seen him before like you know like it's just like oh your prince is in another castle but here's Shane
980916	981456	Poor Shane.
982656	987718	But the quality was good enough that I could see his doggy running down the stairs in the back of the room.
987758	988418	And I was like, oh.
988778	995159	Although when he was looking at my setup, Jason was sitting back here at the table.
995299	996960	And I'm like, Shane, say hi to Jason.
997080	998040	He's like, hi.
998220	1000641	He's doing that whole, I don't know who I'm saying hi to.
1000961	1005902	And he told me later, he's like, yeah, I couldn't see Jason, but I could totally make out the Wendy's bag that was sitting on the table.
1005962	1006882	So I know where he ate dinner.
1008823	1009223	Yeesh.
1010503	1010743	All right.
1010783	1012244	And that's how I really want to be remembered.
1012844	1013645	My last meal.
1016206	1017386	And then you can draw on it.
1017886	1021348	But, you know, so I was writing like hello and like all that stupid stuff.
1021728	1026450	So anyway, my time with the Wii U has been interesting so far.
1026670	1028731	I think they're going to kind of keep adding to it.
1029051	1031612	And at the end of the day, if you want a Wii U, you just have to ask yourself,
1032252	1033453	How bad do I want the games?
1033814	1037316	Because the infrastructure right now is not really where it's at.
1037777	1042700	There's still a lot of... I want to be able to explain Miiverse to all of you.
1042920	1045502	I don't fucking understand it at all.
1045742	1050246	I thought it was supposed to be like Twitter, but you don't really make public posts.
1050626	1056290	You can either send messages to people or you comment on community posts, which in turn are public.
1057331	1059052	I don't fucking get it.
1059953	1060533	It's okay.
1061093	1063074	Nintendo doesn't fucking get it either.
1063474	1065855	They just put this shit together and like, done.
1066095	1068116	It looks like Facebook or Twitter.
1068496	1071317	We're gonna just say this is our online network right here.
1073037	1078679	Ragenator in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, So, what was the TTP for the newer listeners?
1078699	1081200	That's an old OLR acronym for time to penis.
1081260	1085542	Whenever there is a new piece of hardware, we always measure what's gonna be the time before somebody puts their dick in it.
1085562	1086942	Oh, I'm sure it was a few seconds, but
1087603	1090547	No, because he's asking, what was the TTP with the video chat?
1091048	1094153	Shane and I were just friends, so that was not a thing.
1094634	1099541	Sorry, but I'm sure somebody else... But Rob totally had a penis up on his iPhone.
1100883	1101765	I'm kidding, I don't know.
1102358	1106023	TigerClaw says, one thing's for sure, expect Rob to post nothing but kiddie pics on the Wii U.
1117558	1147030	um I would love to post a broad like I would tell if you want to follow me on uh the me-verse thing although I'm not sure what that will accomplish but I'm I'm Rob Roberts so it's all one word Rob Roberts so you can follow me or whatever and um I'll be happy to post kitty pictures publicly but I can't like it won't let me do it like I don't know like unless I go randomly reply to some community message like oh no one care about the uh Skylanders community let me just go post my kitty pics here
1149713	1153035	All the Nintendo communities in Miiverse right now are just game communities.
1153595	1155155	Like, I need a kitty community.
1155656	1157156	Where's my lolcat community?
1158497	1158817	Anyhow.
1159757	1162078	Well, they don't understand online.
1162438	1164059	It's just the way it is.
1164359	1166179	Yeah, now they have online.
1166199	1169541	They have something that sort of resembles what we had last generation.
1170041	1172222	You know, if we're going to consider this another generation.
1172302	1175303	But they just don't get it still.
1175883	1176043	And...
1177631	1178011	I don't know.
1178172	1181455	It's just... Enjoy, I guess.
1182196	1183076	I'm gonna be honest.
1183197	1184037	I'm gonna be honest.
1184138	1187881	My early thought, and keep in mind, early impressions can sometimes change.
1188081	1189042	So here's my disclaimer.
1189082	1190184	This is my early thought.
1191044	1195489	I kind of think the Wii U is not... I mean, it's not a next-gen system.
1195689	1196089	It's not.
1196850	1200514	It is more the pinnacle of this generation.
1202003	1229639	I get what they're trying to do with the whole controller thing it is kind of a neat experience I'll give them that it's you know I hazed it a lot earlier on but that I'll be that that tablet is really fucking crystal clear and it does it does enhance some of the games it's pretty neat but I'm not sure like I really don't feel like I am in the next gen of gaming or this is really pushing the envelope as far as graphics and everything go no it's more like Nintendo's finally playing catch up yay they're caught up
1230640	1232042	Until next year.
1232142	1234425	Now I get to finally play Mario in HD and so forth.
1235427	1236949	At least that's where I'm at right now.
1237910	1241876	Ranma in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says Reggie said it wasn't next gen.
1242659	1250443	And you know, that's a fair response, because we as gamers make all this shit a competition sometimes.
1251703	1257386	And Nintendo is trying to say, wait a minute, wait a minute, no, we're not a next gen, we're the other gen.
1257426	1259187	It was the exact same thing with the Wii.
1259307	1260347	It was the exact same thing with the Wii.
1260367	1262728	That's just an easy way to argue that your system sucks.
1262808	1263429	I mean, it's...
1264349	1264889	Hold on, though.
1265109	1266169	We're not competing with anybody.
1266189	1267350	We're in our own market.
1267370	1268570	Therefore, we're number one.
1268670	1269690	I mean, that's stupid.
1269710	1273491	But the Wii sold more than PlayStations and Xboxes.
1273571	1274492	That is fact.
1274592	1275632	You cannot dispute that.
1275672	1278272	The Wii was the winner of those last three consoles.
1278312	1279953	Whether you like it or not, that's the way it is.
1280233	1281873	Well, it's because they had a great packing game.
1281893	1282594	Everyone bought it.
1282794	1284414	Not gonna happen this generation, though.
1285454	1288515	Nothing wrong with that last generation, but I think I agree with him about the Wii U.
1289437	1306873	And I think I said as much when I called after I was at the launch experience is that because of the higher tier in order to actually have a pack-in and the fact that there is not something that you just drop into, it's been forever since I played Wii Sports, you turn it on, you pick a game, and you start playing.
1307353	1313799	There are a lot more hurdles from what I've seen of the Wii U, and that's unfortunately quite detrimental to...
1315260	1343031	and the thing with the Wii is just or the Wii U is that they assume they're really targeting this at people that bought Wiis they're not targeting this at new consumers because if you're a new consumer then guess what you can't play multiplayer because you got one fucking controller and no other controllers with it you have to go buy all those $40 controllers and all the nunchucks that go along with that and all the other accessories that you need to play those games because once again they marketed this at people that own the Wii and
1343591	1371796	and those people that own the Wii some of whom yes will buy the system but like you're not gonna see old folks homes or anything like that purchasing this to play Nintendo Land no one's gonna give a fuck because they're playing Wii Sports still I just you know what okay I gotta wrap up because I gotta go to the next thing because we have another big thing coming up even before gaming weeks we got another big thing and you know I seriously have nothing to say about any of this well really as a gamer you have no opinion because I don't have one probably not gonna get one mm-hmm
1372543	1373524	I mean, yeah, it's nice.
1374064	1379469	I told Dan I kind of want to win, you know, but I can't talk about something that I don't own.
1379929	1384613	And it's also, it's not something, and I say this to everybody, it's not something you really like have to have.
1384953	1385173	No.
1385714	1388196	I mean, like, you know what I'm more excited about?
1388656	1389297	Fucking Omega.
1390785	1391566	and that's what you're into.
1392226	1393207	Here's the thing.
1393227	1396549	I want to start to wrap this up and I want to make this comment.
1396589	1401953	Despite all of that that you guys are saying with Wii U, I really think this thing is down a similar path as 3DS.
1402113	1408518	I realize 3DS to some extent is struggling as well, but I think Wii U is going to gain a lot of steam next holiday because you know
1409198	1410619	That big holiday game's coming out.
1410659	1412320	That Zelda's coming out next Christmas.
1412560	1414801	Or the big Metroid or something.
1414821	1416282	There will be a huge game.
1416802	1423125	And one thing Nintendo does very well, the characters in the story, love it or not, they have rabid fans.
1423365	1431229	And that's gonna sway a lot of people to picking those up even next holiday, even with new Xbox and new PlayStation possibly out on the market.
1431570	1434051	And I guess this is a whole other can of worms.
1434211	1435612	I think we'll have new Xbox.
1435672	1437913	I'm not so sure right now we're gonna have new PlayStation next year.
1438513	1440954	I don't see why they should be in a rush.
1441414	1443255	Why should there be a new Xbox by the same token?
1444156	1450318	Honestly, I don't think it's really going to be... They're not going to be worried about it because the longer they take on their systems, the better they're going to be.
1450659	1454821	And if you think about it, if they're... Okay, let's just say this system is not next-gen.
1454841	1456101	This system is current-gen.
1456922	1458542	How are you going to compete against the Xbox?
1458762	1464105	The Xbox or the PlayStation 3, for that matter, they have a huge library of games and they're probably going to be cheaper.
1464765	1467808	So, why should I... And that's the other problem, too.
1468028	1476855	I have an Xbox 360 and a PlayStation 3, and even if I just had one of those, there's no need for me to buy a Wii U unless I really want to play New Super Mario Bros.
1476915	1485422	in HD, which, you know, it's kind of like, you know, I probably would have already played it on the Wii or on the 3DS or on the DS.
1486482	1487643	And it's just not that...
1488664	1491546	No, it's just like throwing a fresh coat of paint on an old game.
1491826	1492426	It's fun.
1493667	1494248	Yeah, cool.
1494288	1495468	Mario games are fun.
1495608	1497069	And I can play New Super Mario Bros.
1497249	1499451	on the Wii, on the 3DS, on the DS.
1500051	1508276	I don't need to buy a brand new system for $350 plus the game to play it.
1508356	1509137	It's not worth $410. $410.
1511218	1511519	All right.
1511559	1515384	We have a whole nother year to debate this shit until the next console comes out.
1515724	1517166	I do want to transition to something else here.
1517206	1518027	Jason, final thought.
1519429	1521852	Long-term claim chowder because of his kid.
1521913	1525818	Loki's going to be surprisingly in Nintendo camp in about four years, five years.
1526391	1528413	Nah, he'll train the kid to love Call of Duty.
1529213	1530534	He's not going to love Call of Duty.
1530894	1533976	He can love whatever he wants, but that still doesn't matter.
1534437	1536438	Because if he wants to play a Mario game, guess what?
1536959	1537799	There's the Nintendo.
1537939	1539100	There's the Super Nintendo.
1539420	1540341	There's the Game Boy.
1540381	1541082	There's the DS.
1541122	1541682	There's the Wii.
1541982	1544864	I have plenty of Nintendo consoles to play all these stupid games.
1545084	1548847	I don't need to buy a brand new system to play New Super Mario Bros.
1548867	1549808	with fresh coat of paint.
1550428	1551029	No, forget it.
1551469	1552690	Yet you already have that many of them.
1553846	1556127	No, I don't have those systems, but I have emulators.
1556287	1561869	I can emulate all those systems, and I have a Wii, which, let's see, the last time I played that Wii was a few years ago.
1562309	1566190	Well, actually, it was a couple months ago, but that was my wife playing the Wii.
1566330	1577034	All right, we're going to go to a call, because we're going to go have a chat with Rama, and I believe he has a friend there with him, too, from... Hi, you there, Rama?
1577814	1578435	I'm right here.
1578675	1580397	Hey, and you have a buddy with you, right?
1580517	1581799	From AJS?
1581859	1583281	Yeah, hold on for one second.
1583301	1585263	I'm going to bring him right in.
1585463	1586084	He's right there.
1586324	1587325	Oh, hey, look at that.
1587425	1588386	Conference call on Skype.
1588426	1589047	Hey, how you doing?
1589968	1591390	Doing fabulous.
1592972	1593933	Forgive me if I'm saying this wrong.
1593953	1594393	Taiki?
1595174	1595555	Taiki.
1595795	1596896	Taiki, how you doing?
1597830	1598330	Fabulous.
1598390	1598951	Fantastic.
1599191	1599511	Awesome.
1599551	1601793	So you guys were at the launch event last night, right?
1602613	1603174	That's correct, sir.
1603674	1609098	And so I'm guessing all them media cameras were everywhere and it was hype, hype, hype, hype.
1609138	1609999	Was it hype, hype, hype?
1611800	1612260	No.
1612460	1615362	To me it was a lot of hype and a lot of the chill, chill, chill.
1615943	1616123	Yeah?
1617076	1624119	Well, from what I observed, some media, but you know how media goes.
1624239	1627340	It was a little directed.
1627360	1633483	Nintendo told them where to go, what to shoot, at least as far as I could tell.
1635524	1642487	There was a lot going on in the crowd, but it seemed like the media really didn't want to be there.
1643827	1646829	Wow, that's my opinion.
1646969	1652492	You know what though, from my limited time when I was studying to be originally in college, I was going to be a broadcast journalist.
1652572	1653013	Here I am.
1654053	1654914	That doesn't surprise me.
1655074	1657375	They get very unenthusiastic about a lot of things.
1657515	1664319	I think it's just, you know, you build up a resistance to hype, you know, but anyway.
1664619	1672664	So you guys both went as media to cover it and so forth for AJS and OLR, but did you guys walk out of there with one?
1673064	1673224	No.
1673264	1673444	Nope.
1673605	1677067	Oh, did they sell out that night?
1691517	1693158	No, but there was a considerable line.
1694098	1697739	After the event ended, we all went to McDonald's to get a little nosh.
1697799	1704981	And when we left, heading back to the train station, we noticed that there were still about, I would say about 50 to 100 people still in line.
1705181	1705501	Wow.
1706882	1717365	And from my knowledge, the line went up until about 5 o'clock in the morning because some people on my Facebook, oh, let's just say one of my friends kind of went home dejected.
1718305	1719165	Oh, ouch.
1720206	1720946	That's unfortunate.
1721636	1725461	Alright, well you guys are at the event and you guys got some interviews and so forth.
1725541	1727444	So we want to play those here on the show.
1727544	1729787	So tell us about what I'm playing.
1731089	1734133	Well, the ones with the market share, that was Taiki's idea.
1734193	1735255	Taiki, you take that one.
1736095	1742539	Okay, so we were at the Duane Reade across the street from the Nintendo World Store, you know, preparing.
1743119	1746982	We had about four hours to go, so I'm thinking it's time for some Red Bull.
1747022	1753066	So we leave, and I'm looking at the line, and I was thinking there's probably something interesting here.
1753146	1756167	I mean, he's got a lot of people here who obviously enjoy fun.
1757949	1759269	Let's bring it down a little.
1759309	1760911	Let's do something a little more fun.
1762131	1766054	My thought was we need to do something with these people in line.
1766594	1771998	You've seen those segments on Conan where they send someone like Triumph or whoever to the line.
1772198	1778422	I was thinking we need to do something like that but not insulting but very funny and very much inside gaming.
1779602	1786487	So my idea was let's start asking people who look like they're a little older who will know older consoles or
1787116	1795762	What will the Wii U do to the market share for, say, the Dreamcast or the Neo Geo or the Jaguar?
1796182	1803207	All right, let's check out some of these interviews with people and gauging the impact of the Wii U on the market share.
1803988	1804828	We found this man in line.
1805749	1806329	What is your name, sir?
1807530	1808751	John, but you can call me the Hux.
1809451	1809852	The Hux?
1811473	1811833	Interesting.
1811873	1814275	So, Wii U, what do you think?
1815380	1816881	It looks like a very interesting console.
1817081	1817762	Good innovation.
1819263	1822925	I'm really impressed with the changes they've made to the network specifically.
1823706	1825287	But some of the launch titles look good.
1825327	1826808	I'm sure it's only going to go uphill from here.
1828309	1829930	And I'm really impressed with the controller as well.
1831211	1836074	Okay, and speaking of the controller, how do you think that the Wii U is going to impact the Dreamcast market share?
1836601	1861926	the Dreamcast market share Dreamcast is probably the best system, number one and all I know is, if I want to you're very brave saying that in front of the Nintendo World Store, sir hey Dreamcast go buy one buy some CD-ROMs go get a disc burner I don't know what you're going to do put some games on there, play that up this man knows what's up this man knows what's up
1866981	1867441	Your name, sir?
1867681	1867981	Jason.
1868521	1868902	Jason.
1868922	1870342	What do you think of the Wii U?
1870682	1875603	I'm really excited for the Wii U. I've always been a hardcore Nintendo fan, so... What do you think of the new controller?
1875843	1876844	I think it's awesome, dude.
1877064	1879004	I think it's a big step forward in gaming in general.
1879905	1884246	So, what do you think that the Wii U is going to do to the TurboGrafx-16's market share?
1886606	1887467	Is that a serious question?
1888427	1888967	Dead serious.
1890387	1890828	You know what?
1890968	1892148	I'm not even worried about market shares.
1893833	1896736	So, wait a minute, we got the new Mario game, how do you think that's going to compare to Bonk?
1898057	1899378	I mean, Bonk has its place.
1899779	1901060	You can't take that away from Bonk.
1902922	1903562	Man knows his stuff.
1904163	1904543	Let's go.
1905744	1906345	And your name, sir?
1907446	1908867	My name is Plinio Busato.
1909828	1912330	Alright, and what do you think of the Wii U?
1912350	1913532	I think it's going to be awesome.
1913692	1915033	I'm really excited about that.
1915373	1915874	I really am.
1916875	1917996	What do you think of the new controller?
1919297	1932723	I think it's very innovative, it's fresh, and it's nice because after the Wii, which was very innovative and brought something new, I think this controller is a follow-up, and it's really nice.
1932923	1933243	Can't wait.
1933944	1937085	What do you think that the Wii U is going to do to the Neo Geo's market share?
1937865	1938286	Oh, wow.
1938966	1939966	I don't have an idea.
1940426	1945849	I hope it's going to keep the leadership that the Wii brought.
1945869	1946569	I don't know.
1947770	1948030	Thank you.
1949454	1950535	My name is Kim.
1951195	1951615	Hi, Kim.
1952396	1953216	What do you think of the Wii U?
1953436	1954437	I think it's amazing.
1954497	1955657	I can't wait to play it.
1955717	1956518	I'm so excited.
1956538	1958359	So what do you think of the new Wii U controller?
1959239	1960220	It's actually very light.
1960240	1964562	I've played it before, so it's surprisingly light, and it's just amazing.
1964582	1965903	It brings the whole game to life.
1966843	1970685	So what do you think that the Wii U is going to do to the Sega Saturn's market share?
1971366	1972046	Sega Saturn?
1972587	1973127	Sega Saturn.
1975208	1978510	Panzer Dragoon, Virtua Fighter.
1981904	1982344	Your name, sir?
1982645	1983245	Carlos Rivera.
1983705	1985327	Carlos, what do you think of the Wii U?
1985947	1987148	Oh, I'm very excited about it.
1987568	1992672	I've been reading up on it since they announced it was going to come out, and that's why I'm here now, to get it.
1992692	1993813	Excellent, excellent.
1993873	1994894	What do you think of the new controller?
1995375	1996555	Oh, I love the tablet controller.
1996576	1998977	I love the fact that it's a tablet.
1999057	2002660	You can play the games on it, other than your screen.
2003061	2003441	I love that.
2004506	2007309	What do you think this is going to do to the Atari Jaguar's market share?
2007709	2011573	The Atari Jaguar has that 16, that numpad button controller.
2012754	2015317	Well... That was pretty innovative.
2015837	2020702	It was pretty innovative, but I, I mean, you know, I'm going to be looking into that too, of course.
2021511	2022052	Excellent, excellent.
2022872	2026935	Do you think maybe that girl might have known what an N-Gage was?
2027016	2028717	Maybe she should have checked on that market share.
2028757	2029137	I don't know.
2029237	2031199	She's like, what's a Sega Saturn?
2031239	2031679	I don't know.
2032300	2034061	That just makes me hurt in my heart.
2036283	2038325	Please, no one remember what the N-Gage was.
2038485	2042868	I love the people in the background going, Sega Saturn?
2042928	2044029	I'm not in this.
2044109	2046131	I used to have an N-Gage.
2046869	2047470	Yeah, I know.
2047911	2048652	Yeah, we gave it away.
2050775	2059968	So, Loki, I thought I saw you kind of twitching over there a little bit when they were asking about the tablets and some of the people were like kind of giving the same answer.
2060048	2062692	So innovative, so different, so new, so fresh.
2063032	2064633	That's no, that's not an answer.
2064673	2065874	That's just like a canned answer.
2066534	2067855	That is literally right there.
2067915	2069176	That is subliminal advertising.
2069216	2074218	That's from basically, they keep hearing it repeated to them that this is so innovative and stuff.
2074859	2078141	And then they go and say, oh yeah, it's so innovative.
2078201	2079221	That's what they tell their friends.
2079521	2082123	What is so fucking innovative about this tablet?
2082303	2085265	Oh, it's a tablet that exists pretty much on everything right now.
2085285	2087146	It is a shit ton better than smart glass, I'll tell you that.
2087646	2091809	I said smart glasses, nothing more than a fancy Wi-Fi remote for the 360, that's all it is
2114188	2134421	Alright, well, before we get into that So, the tablet's all it is is on live for the Wii Fair enough Well, not really, I mean, the big difference that you'll see with the Wii I think it's a huge difference too, but anyway It's just low latency, that's all It's latency, it's low latency Anyhow, alright, let's talk about some of these other interviews Who else did you talk to while you were there at the show?
2135305	2151809	Well, while we were discussing the whole market share quip, we came across this one guy named Nick who does charity for one of his closest friends because they were on the line for the Wii, but unfortunately his friend passed away from leukemia, so they do a chocolate charity in his honor every year.
2151969	2152550	Oh, that's cool.
2153310	2153990	I like that.
2154030	2154730	Let's hear from this guy.
2155350	2155950	We found this man.
2156010	2156631	Your name again, sir?
2157071	2158031	My name is James Brief.
2158860	2165006	James, do you have any particular connection to the Wii and Wii launch dates?
2166047	2177297	Yeah, actually, my friends and I, years ago, were in the same line waiting for the Wii, and one of our friends, Nicholas Capobianco, since then, he passed away from leukemia.
2178478	2191785	and every year since then, our friends, we get together like we did in the old days and we have a gaming marathon where we play games weekend straight, stream it live on the net at nixmarathon.org and we raise money for a child's play.
2192285	2195827	It's a charity that raises money for pediatric hospitals.
2196407	2196847	Very cool.
2196947	2201329	Very reminiscent of Loading Ready Run's Desert Bus for Hope.
2202030	2203050	So I think that's very cool.
2203891	2204131	Yeah.
2204787	2206808	Do you have any other comments about the Wii U?
2207268	2208269	Oh, looking forward to it.
2208729	2211330	What do you think this is going to do to the GameCube's market share?
2212251	2214112	I think connectivity is on its way back.
2214672	2215112	Fabulous.
2216152	2217573	The connectivity is on its way back.
2217793	2219254	Well, that's a very noble cause.
2219354	2220435	That's actually really awesome.
2220575	2222556	So props to that guy.
2222576	2223096	That's great.
2223176	2224416	And the group of friends that do that.
2224477	2228659	I hope if I inevitably leave this world too soon, y'all will do something similar.
2228699	2229299	I think that's great.
2229983	2231164	You know we will because we love you.
2231284	2234446	I'll totally start a charity to get me game systems.
2235206	2235607	Stop.
2235767	2236187	Alright.
2237168	2238008	Moving on.
2238529	2240110	Who else did you guys talk to?
2241030	2244692	Well, the next clip I called Wii U Gets Grilled Cheese Sandwiches.
2245213	2250316	It seems that the staff was handing out drinks, food, to everybody that's online.
2250516	2257541	So as we were interviewing this one parent that's on the line for Wii U, staffer comes by, hands us grilled cheese sandwiches.
2257721	2258561	So we're like, why not?
2258581	2259182	Let's roll with it.
2259949	2260890	Heck yeah, let's hear this.
2261912	2263154	Hey, DJ Ranma S here.
2263374	2269943	We are live, well, sort of live, outside of Nintendo World with the thousands and thousands of the Nintendo's fans.
2271670	2272450	Do you hear that?
2272651	2275272	These people are psyched for a Wii U and you know what?
2276453	2278614	The Wii U makes some real good grilled cheese sandwiches.
2278634	2279014	Look at that.
2279354	2279795	Look at that.
2280455	2280915	Look at that.
2281315	2284277	The Wii U makes really good grilled cheese sandwiches.
2284297	2287959	Something that the PS3 could not do, that damn George Foreman grill.
2288419	2293943	Now, we're talking to some people out here about their thoughts about the Wii U and how long have you been on the line for this console?
2294523	2296144	Since about 2 o'clock this afternoon.
2296764	2300206	Well, so you decided not to come out here on a Monday or Tuesday and be like, I'm number one?
2300326	2305128	I did have to work, but somebody has to pay for the Wii U. True, but do you have kids?
2305348	2305548	Yes.
2306489	2308350	Did you think about sending the kids out here to hold the spot?
2308570	2310991	Somebody has to go to school.
2311011	2312492	Well, there's a will, there is a way.
2312732	2316614	So tell me, is this the first time you are online for a game or a console like this?
2316714	2316934	Yes.
2317614	2318835	Why are you out here for this?
2319175	2319615	Right here.
2320536	2322457	Actually, I just wanted to see how crowded it would be.
2324058	2324638	As you can...
2326656	2328778	And as you can see, it is very crowded.
2328798	2330339	It's just a thinned out version.
2330659	2333641	So as you know, Christmas is right around the corner.
2333721	2338345	So how much pressure are you under to get this console under the tree?
2338905	2339826	Oh, a lot of pressure.
2340206	2340846	A lot of pressure.
2340886	2342508	I'm always under pressure every Christmas.
2342728	2343769	I'd set it up today.
2344629	2345030	Today?
2345330	2347611	Yeah, I don't care if I get back at like midnight.
2347631	2348272	I don't care.
2348852	2350874	Well, I remember when the Super Nintendo came out.
2351294	2354917	I played it and I was told, pack it up, put it back in the box and put it back under the tree.
2355097	2356098	It would go back under the tree.
2357881	2360782	What have you just wrapped the empty... There you go!
2361122	2363622	Have you thought about just wrapping just the empty box under the tree?
2364363	2365023	It could work.
2365763	2369364	I think that would be a good thing, so what games are you planning on getting out of here with?
2369744	2371044	Right now, just Nintendo Land.
2371084	2374665	I'm waiting for some of the other games to come out towards the end of this year.
2375085	2376626	I'm going to buy a new Super Mario Bros.
2376906	2379447	2, Zombie U, maybe a little later after launch.
2380467	2382587	Hey, that sounds like a plan, so thanks a lot for your time!
2383147	2384108	Arigato gozaimasu!
2384288	2384988	Datashimashite!
2385515	2387156	I was a very excited family.
2388577	2389378	Did I hear her right?
2389418	2390879	They set up the tree already?
2391720	2393541	The tree is set up around the corner.
2393561	2396243	The lighting ceremony is like sometime this or next week.
2396263	2397744	Oh, the Rockefeller tree.
2397944	2398785	Right, right, right.
2398825	2399345	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
2399365	2400946	They usually do that over the Thanksgiving weekend.
2400986	2401707	All right, I gotcha.
2401867	2402287	I gotcha.
2402607	2403808	All right, so what's this next one you got?
2404529	2411574	Well, Link was online, so I had to ask him what his thoughts were, and did Zelda know that he left the castle?
2413004	2417845	Hey, DJ Ranma S here at Rockefeller Center right in front of Nintendo World.
2418725	2419406	Take a look at that.
2419546	2421066	That is an awesome view, ain't it?
2422726	2423187	Beautiful.
2423787	2424227	Beautiful.
2424627	2426967	Right here, I'm chilling out with Link from Hyrule.
2427147	2428108	Link, what's going on, brother?
2428368	2434149	Just hanging out with my fellow diehard Nintendo fans and enjoying the night and having a good time.
2434649	2436570	So what brings you here tonight, good friend?
2436990	2437990	Wii U, obviously.
2438910	2441131	What about the Wii U that you want so bad?
2441974	2443895	because Nintendo, man.
2444115	2445396	That's all I got to say.
2445416	2446476	Nintendo's the short answer.
2446857	2452860	The long answer is I'm really excited about the new innovation that Nintendo's brought out with the new tablet controller.
2454521	2458783	They always set the bar with everything that they do, every generation.
2459623	2466827	They were the first for the joystick, the first for the shoulder buttons, the first for the rumble feature, the first for the motion, now they're the first for the touchscreen controller.
2468028	2469749	And that's just what they do, and they do it best.
2470762	2473624	Wow, this brother, he's die hard, really die hard.
2473784	2482489	So Link, let me ask you, if you're here online for the Wii U, who's watching Zelda?
2484290	2485110	That's an excellent question.
2486311	2489273	Here's the thing, does she even know that you left the castle to be here?
2489393	2491594	No, I snuck out for a couple days, actually, yeah.
2493526	2498467	Well, I hope that Ganon doesn't try to roll up on your property, man.
2498487	2500348	She has Sheik watching her, so she'll be alright.
2501068	2502788	Sheik's a tough mother, you know.
2504328	2506649	So, Sheik is watching Zelda.
2506669	2507369	Not Sheik, I'm sorry.
2507789	2508049	Impa.
2508209	2510590	Zelda is Sheik.
2510670	2511190	I made a mistake.
2511850	2512410	Impa's watching.
2512490	2514771	An old woman is watching Zelda.
2515191	2516111	Yeah, she's a Sheikah.
2518356	2521144	Well, you can't beat that kind of logic, so thank you, good sir.
2521224	2521906	Thank you very much.
2522347	2523109	Thank you very much.
2523390	2523891	No problem.
2524537	2530040	So Loki, I know that guy, you know, at first I was like, oh, he's just another kind of blind Nintendo fanboy.
2530120	2532701	However, he made a pretty damn good point.
2532821	2535862	Nintendo tends to set the bar with a lot of their shit.
2536223	2537823	I know you were sitting there going joystick.
2537863	2539924	They didn't do the joystick, but they did.
2540245	2543466	You can say that Nintendo set the bar for the modern gamepad.
2543866	2545987	The Kinect would have never happened if it wasn't for the Wii.
2546467	2546808	Thoughts?
2547789	2548892	The Kinect would have happened.
2549535	2551200	I mean, it's camera technology.
2551521	2554331	The Kinect wouldn't have happened if the eye toy hadn't happened.
2556021	2558743	Well, I just think that they should have stuck with the Coleco's model.
2560564	2563266	I miss my Intellivision pad.
2563566	2567929	Is the Coleco the one where you put the plastic stuff on the TV?
2568049	2569089	Or is it the Fairchild?
2569109	2570430	No, you didn't put it on the TV.
2570470	2572211	You slid a little thing into the number pad.
2572591	2575053	What was the thing that you would actually have to put the overlays on the television?
2575153	2576514	Was that the Fairchild?
2576594	2577014	Odyssey.
2577294	2577715	Thank you.
2578255	2584499	Well, you know, actually the Odyssey 2, though, didn't have... I had a couple games that used that, but not many that did.
2584719	2585159	I like Odyssey, too.
2614690	2615210	Yes, I was.
2615330	2617091	Alright, so this is Mario and Black Luigi.
2617131	2617471	Here we go.
2618472	2619472	I'm doing a commentary.
2619632	2620553	What are you doing, Luigi?
2621313	2622633	I was also doing the commentary.
2622894	2623854	Why are you not in your mansion?
2623994	2625655	You're going to get scared by the ghosts.
2626815	2629136	You should be off chasing after Peach again.
2629376	2630057	I need a break.
2630197	2631297	I always chase after Peach.
2631457	2632658	Peach never gives me nothing.
2633098	2633758	I need a break.
2634199	2635899	So is that why she ran off with Bowser again?
2637600	2639101	Don't you go screwing this thing over.
2639421	2640281	Bowser will take her.
2640661	2641522	She won't take Bowser.
2643240	2644301	So how's that the my fault?
2644501	2645341	That's not the other fault.
2645361	2647522	You get out of here.
2647803	2648283	Aww.
2650284	2652926	Ranma, you know I love you, but you're the biggest goddamn nerd.
2653706	2653966	Yes.
2654226	2654767	Yes, I know.
2655347	2655587	All right.
2656027	2656348	You too.
2656668	2657748	What's this next one?
2658829	2665233	This one was Taiki's idea of talking to Mario about the financial crisis in the Mushroom Kingdom.
2665733	2665853	What?
2667034	2669075	Is the Mushroom Kingdom about to go off a fiscal cliff?
2684116	2684456	Who knows?
2684877	2688941	Let's hear it.
2689001	2691403	Oh, sorry, I was playing the interview over you.
2691463	2691763	Go ahead.
2692984	2695827	With the funny physics in the Mushroom Kingdom, I don't know if that's possible.
2696888	2697869	Alright, let's hear the clip.
2699372	2700733	This is Taiki with the voice of Greeks.
2702774	2706055	And this is for a special report, the financial crisis in the Mushroom Kingdom.
2706655	2707356	I have Mario here.
2707816	2710637	Mario, I've been told you've been tasked to collect a million coins.
2711657	2714899	What are your thoughts on the current financial status in the Mushroom Kingdom?
2715393	2719376	So the rumors that they are foreclosing on the castle at the Mushroom Kingdom is true.
2744506	2745187	What rumors?
2745447	2746187	I don't hear nothing.
2746307	2747128	I'm just at the beach.
2747929	2748969	Sir, you're avoiding the question.
2749630	2750210	What question?
2751711	2752972	You look a lot like a Koopa.
2753873	2755074	Want I to stop you?
2755834	2757055	No, I'm just asking questions, sir.
2757936	2758757	Just asking questions.
2759077	2765141	So what are your thoughts on the overabundance of stars and how that's affected the stock market?
2766602	2767723	Overabundance of stars?
2768404	2769545	Make Mario invincible?
2770025	2770946	Invincible Mario kick ass?
2775602	2777663	There's a massive price crash on stars.
2779804	2780824	Oh, I see, I see.
2782104	2783645	Mario doesn't understand economics, does he?
2784205	2785385	Not very much, no.
2786306	2788926	I kick, I stomp on the goombas, I kick at the koopas.
2789346	2793307	I beat at the buzzer, I collect the coins, I no get a nothing from a peach.
2794528	2795108	Not even cake?
2795568	2796448	Not even cake.
2797609	2798409	Oh, woe is on me.
2799918	2804000	And that was Taiki, Voice of Geeks Network, signing off.
2824624	2829566	So did you guys get on some of the news stations dressed up or what?
2829706	2830147	What happened?
2831447	2836109	Me, not really because the only people I saw there was people from Nintendo.
2836129	2836849	That was just about it.
2836889	2841971	But there was photographers and someone from Weekly Famitsu took my picture.
2842532	2842912	Oh, hey.
2843212	2843552	Nice.
2844252	2845513	And Mashable was there as well.
2846380	2846800	Yomiuri Shimbun
2865585	2872467	I guess it tends to happen more with Nintendo than it does the other companies because it seems like PlayStation and Vita and all that were out way earlier.
2872527	2875087	I know the Xbox is always coming out earlier over in Japan.
2875107	2877248	Well, Xbox makes a stud in Japan.
2877288	2877548	All right.
2877808	2879668	Just they don't sell one for a few months.
2879688	2880408	Oh, whatever.
2880488	2880788	All right.
2880868	2884909	Let's get these last two interviews are some big ones.
2885169	2887170	So set this one up for us, Ranma.
2887190	2887850	What's next for us?
2888790	2900568	Well, at the front of the line was Triforce who says he was there on the line for about a month and he has some bit of surprising news to let the fans know about him doing console launches.
2901649	2902511	Ooh, okay, let's hear it.
2903959	2914041	Hey, DJ Ranma S here in front of Nintendo World USA where in just mere hours the new Wii U is going to hit the store shelves and take names and kick a lot of butt.
2914341	2917922	Now as you can see behind me, there are diehard fans out here.
2918302	2919782	How diehard are you guys?
2922443	2923483	How long y'all been out here?
2925484	2931105	As you can see, but through the maze and through the vines, we're here with the one, the only, Triforce.
2931305	2932245	Good to meet you, sir.
2932998	2933558	What's going on guys?
2934038	2937719	Not much, we're doing what we gotta do, so tell me, how long have you been waiting out here?
2938660	2940380	Almost a month since March 23rd.
2942421	2947482	I'm dead serious, since March 23rd.
2947522	2949883	I'm still thinking about the 3DS since October 23rd.
2951703	2953904	October 23rd, now that's hard, that's dedication.
2955664	2957285	I tip my hat to you good sir.
2958655	2963179	So, I do recall that you were somewhere else for the Wii, is that correct?
2963459	2966562	Yes, it was Toys R Us, and that was back in November.
2966762	2967603	I can remember that date.
2968143	2969404	Oh yeah, we all remember that.
2969465	2972387	So, why here instead of there?
2972627	2983457	I thought, well, first of all, this is my last launch that I'm going to be doing, and I took a guess, I did some investigating, and I just felt that they were going to do the launch here.
2984321	2986203	See, that's where it is, because you know what?
2986504	2992051	We talked to people about the Wii, and I kept telling everyone, Nintendo World is the jump-off spot, because this is where the party is at.
2992331	2994934	So, how many of these launch events have you done?
2995315	2996957	This is my eighth and final one.
2997698	2999040	Why is it your final one, good sir?
2999900	3007842	I want to go and try to do some type of other marketing in the gaming community from the urban market, from the grassroots side.
3008442	3014023	Although I do a lot of this, I want to leave this for somebody else to do while I can help out elsewhere.
3014643	3021065	I've done enough of it, and I'm 35 years old, so now's the time to stop.
3021345	3026146	That's not to say that I won't be at other launch parties, but the whole camping for the first, I'm going to stop it.
3026186	3026606	This is it.
3027276	3033398	So in other words, after this, you're going to take, someone else is going to inherit the Power Glove, but you now have the power.
3033418	3034839	Oh, they're going to have to fight you for it.
3035159	3036440	No, they're not getting that.
3036460	3038160	They're just going to have to line up.
3038901	3039821	I'm keeping the Power Glove.
3040421	3043222	Between you and me, I'd stomp somebody out for that to keep my Power Glove.
3044003	3045503	Well, that may happen, yeah.
3045723	3047444	So what was your first launch?
3048444	3049585	The Nintendo DS.
3050458	3052780	And how was that compared to the launch for the Wii U?
3053101	3055183	Well, each year Nintendo gets better with the launch.
3055203	3056924	That was all the way back in 2004.
3057285	3060989	And that was the first launch that I got first in.
3061049	3063992	My first ever launch was a Nintendo 64.
3065053	3069017	I wasn't first in line, but that's what made me get into the whole launch thing.
3069437	3071659	Then after that, some unmentionables.
3071699	3074182	I won't mention the name of the other competitors.
3074682	3076363	Oh, those guys.
3076583	3078064	Those guys, yeah.
3078104	3081486	That's because I was working for GameStop, so I had to work the launch party.
3081886	3082926	So it wasn't as fun?
3083827	3085608	No, I wouldn't say it wasn't as fun.
3085988	3087669	I wasn't in the line for the launch.
3087709	3089249	I just worked the launch party.
3089830	3093992	And then the first launch party I became first for was the Nintendo DS.
3095339	3096259	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3122344	3123385	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3140451	3156781	it's like that line from Lethal Weapon I'm getting too old for this shit alright we got one more interview from the event and dare I say it's a Orange Lounge Radio VOG Network exclusive we're about to get
3157581	3168608	Alright, and I've been teasing a little bit on Twitter that you had a pretty big interview, but it's short, but we wanted this to be special for the fans that actually bothered to tune in and listen tonight.
3169108	3170829	Ranma, please set up this last interview.
3171849	3174211	Well, the man...
3175908	3179069	shows up, and we all know who the man is, Reggie.
3179690	3184171	He's going through the crowd, doing autographs, and saying hi to everyone.
3184612	3190454	And we catch him right before he goes inside Nintendo World, and me and Taiki ask him a couple of quick questions.
3191767	3194509	Okay, you're going to have to set up the clip a little longer than that.
3194549	3197151	The live listeners literally just got dropped.
3199613	3200253	Word must have gone up.
3200273	3204836	But see, yes, Ranma, you're always the first to complain about the live stream going down.
3204876	3206798	And yet here we are still talking to each other.
3206898	3207498	Isn't that funny?
3208339	3208999	I know.
3210761	3211061	All right.
3211261	3211461	All right.
3211501	3216805	With the apologies to the podcast listeners who are hearing this for the second time, Ranma, go ahead and set it up one more time.
3217847	3218768	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3237998	3240779	Okay, this is going to be really awkward, but the stream just went down again.
3242380	3245081	We were up for like two seconds, and then it went down.
3245501	3247982	I need you guys to kill all excess internet activity.
3248142	3248882	I'm not doing anything.
3248942	3250883	I'm just saying I need everybody across the board.
3251163	3255665	Any chat, I need it all closed, because this is killing the show with all these computers running.
3256185	3257125	So, all right.
3257185	3258386	Even my torrents of Shiza porn?
3259847	3261227	Yeah, any torrents of that stuff.
3261328	3263529	Any Dropbox that might be hiding in the background or whatever.
3263569	3264449	It's got to all go down.
3264930	3265570	So, okay.
3266991	3267831	We are connected.
3267891	3268432	Here we go.
3268952	3270153	Sorry, podcast listeners.
3270193	3275236	I feel like Seacrest on American Idol where it's like I'm drawing it out for like two minutes, the big interview.
3275296	3277377	But please know it's for the live listeners' benefit.
3277757	3279618	Okay, I am showing it as streaming again.
3280018	3280919	So here we go.
3281459	3282620	The big interview with Reggie.
3285353	3285934	That's good.
3285974	3286854	You'll be here as well, right?
3286994	3287515	Absolutely.
3287535	3288896	Everybody, how excited are you?
3289116	3289716	How excited?
3289776	3290657	I'm very excited.
3291758	3292478	This is it, right?
3292658	3293819	This is it.
3293879	3296141	A new generation of gaming begins tonight.
3297321	3302645	What's your name?
3302705	3305127	Is that a British accent?
3305247	3305487	Yeah.
3305967	3307789	Came all the way from the UK just to be here?
3308249	3309750	No, actually.
3309770	3310250	No, come on.
3310270	3310911	You could have played me.
3310951	3313253	You could have said, yes, came all the way here.
3315915	3322504	There's a small question.
3322564	3323825	Million Coins and New Super Mario 2.
3323865	3327751	Do you have any comments about the current economic crisis in Mushroom Kingdom?
3329144	3331205	You know, Mario's just trying to do his part.
3331265	3332406	He's collecting coins.
3332606	3335948	He'll go back and spend them someday, but he's trying to help out.
3335968	3338669	There will be no fiscal cliff in the Mushroom Kingdom.
3339109	3339990	Thank you very much!
3340010	3342611	Did you get it?
3343812	3347714	Alright, so you have the chance to ask Reggie one thing.
3352105	3358027	and you chose to ask him how he feels about the fiscal cliff in the Mushroom Kingdom.
3358868	3363630	But you gotta admit that he actually picked up on it and rolled with it.
3363670	3365831	You got to give the man credit for that.
3367251	3369452	Orange Lounge Radio exclusive, everybody.
3369532	3373834	Reggie comments on the fiscal cliff in the Mushroom Kingdom.
3374794	3376715	I mean, that's pretty cool and all.
3377635	3381617	It's almost as good as me asking Jason Enos about In The Groove, but
3382429	3387696	I'm sure asking them about the financial crisis in a fictional video game is fucking awesome.
3388377	3389538	That's great use of time.
3391300	3394785	He's going to get into the media and he's going to answer all these questions about whatever.
3394805	3395266	To be fair,
3397008	3402674	To be fair, it will be a bumper, but to be fair, Loki, you know damn well it doesn't matter what they ask.
3402774	3404856	They would have got the same canned answer for anything.
3404916	3412023	So for them to throw him a curveball, I say you guys are the biggest fucking nerds, and I so appreciate that about you.
3412843	3413184	Thank you.
3415769	3416829	I think that was brilliant.
3418710	3421011	I would rather have had that than the canned response.
3421311	3423171	If we want the canned response, we can look at press releases.
3424051	3426232	You press them for more, whatever.
3426552	3430573	Yeah, and the whole five seconds before he goes, I gotta go inside, bye.
3430593	3431994	Yeah, Loki's jealous he wasn't there.
3432294	3434174	Alright, we're not 2020, so.
3434314	3438835	It's a little bit differently, and also, you can thank Taiki, that was his idea, alright?
3439176	3440716	That went over damned well.
3440996	3446980	Well, you both contributed a lot to that segment, and I really appreciate you guys sharing that with OLR first.
3447041	3450243	I know you could have held on to that for AJS, but I really appreciate that.
3450963	3452364	VOG podcast sticking together.
3452404	3452885	It's awesome.
3453846	3454646	Hey, that's what we're here for.
3454666	3458389	Plus, the band has one of the official VOG sheets.
3459159	3459860	Nice.
3460400	3461061	Very nice.
3461922	3465045	Well, we're an hour into the show and we haven't even got to our gaming weeks yet.
3465106	3467368	So I'm probably going to wrap this up so we can move on.
3467428	3469330	But you have anything else you guys want to get out?
3469370	3470371	Taiki, great job.
3471072	3473014	Anything you want to get out here before we let you go?
3474235	3476598	Can I talk about the issue of Quebec independence?
3477439	3477959	If you want.
3478780	3479901	Independence for Quebec now.
3480582	3481123	Viva Quebec.
3482783	3484063	Ramma, anything you want to get out?
3484483	3485604	They can succeed a little with Texas.
3485624	3487984	Yeah, but I think I should save it for calling back later.
3488004	3490465	It has something to do with Wii U's and ShameStop.
3491165	3491645	Oh, boy.
3491765	3492085	All right.
3492185	3493345	Well, hopefully talk to you later.
3493385	3495506	Hopefully you don't run too long tonight and I can take a lot of calls.
3495606	3495886	All right.
3496246	3496706	No problem.
3496726	3497166	Take care, buddy.
3497566	3498546	And thanks, guys.
3499026	3499387	No problem.
3500147	3504008	You can hear Anime Jam Session Tuesdays at vognetwork.com, 630 Pacific, 930 Eastern.
3508447	3520315	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com Use the passphrase, bronze Big thanks to them for being out there Even though their questions were a little bit lulzy You know what?
3522176	3529241	I'll take it Alright, moving on Let's get to our video game weeks And how was our gaming week?
3529281	3531062	It's only an hour into the show Loki!
3532363	3532963	How you doing?
3533163	3534844	Oh wait, I always start with Jamie How you doing?
3534884	3535665	How was your gaming week?
3536466	3538149	I already know what she's going to say.
3538169	3538810	It was sweet.
3540513	3541254	Yeah, what's that?
3541832	3546254	I played and beat Sugar Rush on the Wreck-It Ralph website.
3547255	3548355	It was fucking fun.
3548455	3550136	It needs to be like a for-reals game.
3550536	3556799	I mean, and I was actually really surprised by how long it was, because I mean, I was playing for a few solid hours.
3556959	3567424	It's like you have four stages with three races in each stage, and like the first two, I think, are two laps, and then the third one is three laps, and then the last one's three laps.
3568045	3570386	And it's much longer and complex.
3570546	3570646	And
3571366	3580454	I mean, it's like a stupid little kart racer, but it was really fun, and I've decided that Rancis is the best name ever, and my firstborn, if I have one, will be Rancis.
3581134	3584057	Rancis Flubberbuffer, whatever his name is.
3584657	3586399	The one with the Reese's Cup on his head.
3587419	3587700	And then...
3589804	3592526	Then I played a bunch of Mass Effect 2.
3592646	3593646	I played a bunch of it today.
3594206	3594447	Nice.
3595007	3596848	And then I actually did a whole bunch of design work.
3597048	3603831	But my design work had me going and pulling samples off of old video game packaging.
3603932	3605332	Because I wanted certain colors.
3605993	3608014	Like I pulled the gold off the Nintendo cartridge.
3608454	3609474	Off of the Zelda cartridge.
3609935	3610055	Oh.
3610615	3612856	because I wanted that particular shade.
3613136	3618537	Because it's like when you sample part of it, it comes out kind of this muted brown.
3619578	3620638	And that was the color I wanted.
3621298	3623499	And I was like, what do I know that reflects that color?
3623539	3628640	So I was sampling NES cartridges to get the right shade of brown off of a gold Zelda cartridge.
3628940	3629420	Very cool.
3630040	3634982	And I actually logged into WoW just because I don't want to get kicked out of the guild.
3635002	3635662	Okay.
3636375	3663110	I hate to say that but I mean I'm trying to build myself back up into actually wanting to level my troll it's just no one plays on Blade's Edge anymore and that's the only character I have I really care about is my main on there Ragenator at live.vognetwork.com expressing surprise DarkSakura won't name her firstborn Garrus WTF no Rancis no actually I'm probably never going to have a kid so it doesn't matter oh no
3663579	3664599	No, I'm serious.
3664819	3666520	At this point, I'm perfectly content with it.
3666900	3669321	All you people who have kids, good luck.
3669381	3669761	You know what?
3669781	3671442	You will have a new kitty to name someday.
3671502	3673122	It's a very similar dilemma.
3673323	3674763	I need a cat in my life right now.
3675763	3678745	But Dan's like, we have to buy a house first.
3679525	3680465	So I'm like, well, fine.
3680505	3681886	If I can buy a house, I can get a cat.
3681986	3684487	For the cat, because the cat needs the house.
3684527	3685207	It won't be your house.
3685247	3686047	It'll be the cat's house.
3686267	3689048	I've decided that when I get a cat, it's going to be named Mochi.
3689448	3689829	I don't care.
3689969	3690849	My cat will be named Mochi.
3691269	3691709	It's a good name.
3692470	3695491	Anything else for your gaming week?
3695751	3696411	Cooking with dog.
3697752	3698573	Okay, no.
3699553	3704775	Going in between playing Mass Effect 2, pausing my game, making udon because I'm also watching cooking with dog.
3705516	3706936	And then going back and playing more Mass Effect.
3706956	3707737	That's been my cycle.
3708037	3709738	Mass Effect, cooking with dog, cooking.
3710258	3711759	Mass Effect, cooking with dog, cooking.
3713079	3714280	Loki, how was your gaming week?
3715172	3743043	I played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 Call of Duty Black Ops 2 because I'm really getting into the single player campaign tried some more of the multiplayer just kind of some system link stuff at work the rest we should be getting copies for everybody this week so we can play some of that and so far loved every minute of it hasn't let me down at all so I'm looking forward to that and I think I fit in a little bit of Minecraft this week as well
3745242	3746383	That's pretty much it.
3747123	3747923	Jason, how about you?
3747963	3749304	It's been a while since we've seen you last.
3749344	3750584	What's been going on in your gaming world?
3750785	3753846	Well, for that time frame... No, not that whole time frame.
3754846	3759849	I've actually been out here for work for a week at this point, just over a week.
3760709	3766392	So the literal week has been rather light because I've been having exciting San Francisco, California fun times.
3766872	3769953	But there is a setup at the office, and the office favorite is FIFA 13, so I've...
3771294	3775677	I've been thoroughly trashed at that game, both by the computer and by my coworkers.
3775837	3778218	Is that the one that they're hazing for being just like FIFA 12?
3778578	3780379	Isn't that all sports games in this generation?
3780399	3781020	That's on the Wii.
3781260	3783661	I mean, like, for real, it is a carbon copy.
3783701	3785222	Like, I'm not, like, no joke.
3785242	3787223	That and Pro Evo are both carbon copies.
3787423	3795608	The last time I was out here, they did have FIFA 12, and the game, the only notable difference I've noticed is that they give you more interactivity during the loading screen.
3796108	3806652	But I completely admit that's completely superficial because I start a multiplayer game and go with it and I can't really comment to single player, you know, GM, those kind of bonus modes, anything like that.
3806692	3807592	I couldn't say at all.
3808712	3818496	They did also get Halo 4 and I started a campaign by myself on, I think the tier is easy, normal, legendary, heroic and I'm on legendary because I thought I could keep up.
3819977	3842130	uh no oh Dan made that mistake no I'm it might be passable with help you know a multiplayer legendary campaign but me by myself I'm still in chapter one and I gave up after playing the same checkpoint just past the same checkpoint about 30 40 times maybe more I'm not entirely sure I suck at Halo and I'm very very sad at this fact
3844364	3846586	Otherwise, yeah, that's really it.
3846867	3851851	I'm still nursing Borderlands 2 since I've been traveling quite a bit over these past two months.
3852612	3856916	And not really sit down and play meaningful games time lately, unfortunately.
3857897	3858298	Alrighty.
3859319	3865605	Most of my week I already talked about with the Wii U launch, so in the interest of time I'm not going to repeat myself, but I will talk about just quickly...
3866105	3873171	Played a little bit of Mass Effect 3 because we tried to set it up so that we have two TVs and two Xbox 360s here at the house.
3873551	3878195	So Alan and I were like, can we play multiplayer with each other even though we only have one copy of the game?
3878255	3882058	And we figured out yes we can because all of multiplayer is on both discs.
3882438	3896447	So we put one disc in one and one in the other and how we got around the online pass is I had Alan play on my usual Xbox and I played on the other one because when you have licensed content on the 360 it's licensed to the original console and your ID.
3896867	3905252	So we made it work and we played and Alan decided he hated it because having to go from keyboard and mouse to controller apparently not a good fit.
3905832	3913981	I also played some Halo 4, finished the first five episodes of Spartan Ops playing with a friend, so that was fun.
3914001	3916304	I think we actually did six, so that was cool.
3916824	3917785	Yeah, Halo, good times.
3917985	3919107	Emphasis on with a friend.
3919647	3922630	Yes, and we play on, I think Spartan Ops we did normal.
3923328	3948182	you know so you know we don't we are not too crazy now all right uh some housekeeping for you guys please remember you can follow us on facebook facebook.com slash orange launch radio as well as twitter twitter.com slash olr meanwhile let's get into some news and a quick thank you to everybody voting in the podcast awards which are now closed thank you very much absolutely yes so thank you to everybody who voted for us in the podcast awards and if you didn't i hope you kept it indie
3949335	3975053	I forgot one more game oh hurry Fairy Solitaire oh I played that too thanks to that tip last week it's cute yeah it's free I can't complain better than Yaris all right let's get into some news Loki Rob having your head drilled open with your brains falling out is better than Yaris all right so there was a there was a system that launched today the Wii U and really I hadn't
3978519	3979760	I can see how you can be confused.
3979800	3981761	It is very similar to the previous generation.
3984823	3988665	You may have been confused and bought another Wii, so you better double check that.
3988885	3989966	No, this one's black.
3991106	3992167	They do make black Wiis now.
3995329	3996589	So, let's see.
3997630	4000192	You know the difference between the Wii U and the Wiis.
4000252	4002813	The Wii has functioning online right now.
4003013	4003814	That's pretty sad.
4005242	4013446	Alright, so the Wii they claim is going to be in larger supply, probably due to less demand, but it is going to be easily more available.
4013986	4032314	They're not going to make their artificial shortage as big this time around, but he says basically their second and third, fourth replenishments are going to be more frequent at holiday time, and you'll be able to get a Wii system or Wii U system before next year, or next holiday, I guess.
4033475	4035236	Which is good, I suppose.
4037477	4044321	Unfortunately, like with most Nintendo console launches of recent, it is missing a few things.
4044601	4057009	And the first being Nintendo's highly advertised and pimped out TV service, which was supposed to be launching with the console, but oh, you know, it's not done, so...
4057449	4065516	It's going to be launching in December, and until then, you're at the wait to watch live TV through this, or your on-demand stuff, Netflix, etc.
4066577	4070260	So it'll be coming in the next few weeks, unless they delay it again, because that's something they do.
4072102	4074023	And then also, of course... Fun!
4075464	4076886	I'm kidding, it's a fun console.
4077466	4078447	It's an easy joke to make.
4078627	4079888	Yeah, it's a fun console.
4080948	4091012	And I'm sure that everybody was really happy that waited in line to get their Wii U system to get home and download your 5GB firmware update, which is fantastic.
4091732	4096654	And, of course, this would also encompass the Miiverse stuff as well.
4097414	4106578	It's funny, though, because apparently there's some people that were having issues with it downloading so slow they thought their console was not working, so they shut it off
4107698	4128702	not a good idea and now their console doesn't work but uh yes five gigabytes so if you're thinking about it if you got that non-black system you have less than half of that storage space left for stuff obviously you're not going to put an actual game on there because there's no room for it but you're not going to be able to fit you know
4129782	4136523	You're going to basically need to get an external storage device, which is kind of... You kind of would have had to anyways, but still.
4137283	4138164	It's not as bad.
4138184	4142724	Remember when the Xbox 360 came out and everyone's like, Oh, hey, the 20 gig hard drives.
4142784	4142985	What?
4144605	4148506	7 gigabytes of this is just the backwards compatibility data.
4149586	4150626	This is almost as bad.
4151406	4156107	Except they didn't have to wait an hour for the backwards compatibility data to exist on that hard drive.
4157589	4172777	and, um, of course, you know, with any network launch, this would be for MMOs and stuff, they've been having a little bit of issues, uh, it's been kind of up and down, probably because of the, you know, high traffic, but thankfully it is back up, so.
4174117	4174597	Fantastic.
4174677	4176178	It worked fine for me, for what it's worth.
4176418	4180679	To be fair, it did take an hour, but I expect that 5 gigs is going to take an hour to download.
4181159	4184099	But it did work fine, and I haven't really had connectivity problems.
4185579	4188120	Well, Wii video chat was a little bumpy.
4188560	4193061	We got some weird error messages that weren't even true, because we were able to connect fine.
4193081	4193561	It was weird.
4194101	4196142	Warning, the person on the other end does not exist.
4197202	4198162	Not quite that, but yeah.
4201124	4202306	I don't know.
4202466	4204508	So, there's your Wii U launch.
4205409	4206070	Get excited.
4207091	4207872	I'm thrilled.
4208813	4209133	Alright.
4209674	4211496	Well, not too thrilled is this guy.
4211996	4213298	He got caught by the police.
4214392	4216193	Justin Success Brooks.
4216773	4218474	Yes, his name was Success Brooks.
4219115	4229341	Well, unfortunately, he wasn't very successful in his business of selling counterfeit Nintendo games in the UK because he got caught and sentenced to 32 months of jail time.
4229881	4231982	He was actually selling counterfeited games.
4232382	4236665	He was working with some dealers in China through 18 different websites.
4237265	4259101	Nintendo had warned, the UK border agency had warned, he had his stock seized at one point however he continued to sell the games through a different website so it was kind of one of those, they weren't going to keep him out any other way so they officially sentenced him to 32 months although even in the UK you don't really end up serving the entire time he'll probably only be serving about half of it
4260754	4272447	What's interesting, Francesca Levitt, who is one of the prosecutors on this case, claiming the victim is not really Nintendo, but legitimate online game retailers who have to compete with counterfeit sellers.
4272968	4273228	Quote,
4275871	4304086	but the damage this has done to the reputation of online retailers is untold and incalculable that's in a statement to the Guardian I would take that down one last one more notch that not so much Evil G and those others but people who do like the use game stores or import game stores or the people who really try to carve out their niche that oh yeah they also sell big retail titles mainstream titles because you don't survive as a business any other way
4305538	4311139	I think it is a good reminder that this kind of stuff doesn't just hurt Nintendo.
4311179	4315360	It hurts everybody in the chain from developers and makers to the people that sell them.
4316501	4317381	It hurts my feelings.
4318121	4318981	And Jamie's feelings.
4319021	4320341	And it gives Reggie hemorrhoids.
4321182	4321442	What?
4322682	4323542	Because he's all butthurt.
4324082	4324482	Oh, I see.
4325183	4325503	All right.
4325823	4327463	Let's move on with another story, DarkSakura.
4328503	4328983	Okay.
4329163	4331324	Well, who likes Pokemans?
4332025	4335588	Who doesn't like Pokemans?
4335888	4337269	Of course Loki raised his hand.
4337729	4346815	Well, actually Nintendo is doing Pokedex iOS, which is their first paid app in the Apple Store.
4346916	4349117	Of course, it's only out in Japan right now.
4349958	4353780	And it covers everything up through black and white.
4354581	4357423	And it's 170 yen, which is about £1.30.
4357623	4360405	So I guess here it would be maybe a $3 download.
4361986	4369053	Um, there's also extra packs with other monsters that, um, go up to, uh, 500 yen.
4369514	4372597	So, uh, yeah, you could pay a lot of money for it.
4372897	4383808	Um, but now, uh, there's still, um, a free app that's the Pokemon Say Tap that was, uh, out for a little bit last year, but for right now, this is their first paid app.
4384505	4401873	I have to say that in some of it may be the language and I know that interfaces do vary highly in between languages but this Pokedex iOS looks kind of as crap as Pokedex 3D on the 3DS store.
4402074	4403454	I never liked it.
4404215	4413019	It may also be that I've kind of abandoned ship as far as Pokemon is concerned and I haven't played it recently enough so I didn't none of the creatures were familiar but this doesn't
4415380	4417980	I heard that this thing is full of in-game purchases, too.
4418241	4419381	Oh, yeah, that's what I was saying.
4419901	4423642	There's four extra packs, and they're 500 yen total.
4423682	4424342	They ain't free.
4424883	4427723	No, I mean, you roughly end up paying about seven bucks.
4428464	4428724	Wow.
4429144	4429764	Six or seven.
4431164	4435946	I'm trying to do a little bit of conversion here, but yeah, you end up paying more like about six bucks.
4436306	4438827	So Loki, you got to be excited about this.
4438907	4442969	It's Nintendo on an Apple product full of microtransactions.
4443029	4444689	This is like made for you.
4446110	4452092	It sounds like just any other app on the iOS, Apple Store or whatever.
4453433	4457174	I think it's just what's interesting is it's not a knockoff for once.
4458075	4458615	This is true.
4459535	4462537	And plus the whole, oh my gosh, it's something Nintendo on Apple.
4462577	4470202	But before the emails correcting us come in, we should say there's a very different relationship when it comes to the Pokemon company.
4470622	4478948	Because even though Nintendo somewhat controls them at the end of the day, if the Pokemon company wants to do something different, they can.
4479288	4483150	And so for them to be the ones dipping their big toe in with this iOS app is not...
4484271	4485452	It's not too surprising.
4485472	4492397	And it could be interesting because if this does very well, which, who knows, maybe that will cause Nintendo?
4492517	4492857	I don't know.
4492897	4502504	But then again, Nintendo's always been very much, no, ever since the CDI, never again will our characters be on another console.
4503305	4503485	So...
4504385	4507226	All right, moving on.
4508727	4509027	All right.
4509547	4514369	So let's talk a little bit about non-Nintendo stuff.
4514910	4516470	Let's talk about Microsoft.
4516530	4521332	And of course, they were celebrating the 10-year anniversary of Xbox Live.
4521812	4532977	And with that, they were giving out some fancy Xbox Live 10-year anniversary themed Xbox 360s to people that had been on live for those 10 years.
4534451	4535731	Of course, certain people didn't get them.
4537952	4538452	Like Bobby.
4540793	4541273	Sorry, Bobby.
4542173	4545294	But there's some random users were getting them.
4545374	4547855	I don't think every 10-year user got one.
4547895	4552736	You probably got entered into a drawing or something behind the scenes and they gave away like 100 of them or something.
4552936	4554056	Yeah, they never really explained it.
4554556	4557197	It doesn't really make any sense to me that they would give you a console.
4557217	4561138	I mean, that's kind of cool that you get a console, but wouldn't you already have a console if you're on Xbox Live?
4561178	4562779	It's like, hooray!
4562799	4563219	My red ringed.
4564119	4572267	All the people that won it are the people that have lived through about five or six Red Rings and E74s, so the next time it invariably happens to their next one, they have a replacement already.
4573648	4575170	And it looks pretty cool, actually.
4575501	4577142	I don't know.
4577882	4580443	It's neat, I guess.
4581523	4589146	Some of you who may have been on there for 10 years will maybe get in an email or something saying, hey, you got a 360 coming your way.
4589186	4595548	You probably would have already got that email or you got the email that I got that says, congrats, here's your code for an avatar helmet.
4596408	4598229	I got an email and two messages.
4598249	4598989	What?
4600444	4602008	Take the fucking helmet, Loki.
4602269	4602990	I don't want the helmet.
4603171	4603472	Take it.
4603652	4604474	I'm not wearing the helmet.
4604594	4604795	No.
4605036	4605276	Take it.
4605296	4605958	Here's another message.
4605998	4606660	Here's another code.
4606720	4607462	Take the damn helmet.
4607482	4609246	It puts the helmet on its avatar.
4613391	4613651	Nice.
4615293	4622859	All right, speaking of Microsoft, this is interesting because we know the PlayStation magazine's stopping, the Nintendo Power's stopping.
4622919	4626762	Well, Xbox World is also going to cease publishing in December.
4627222	4628123	But this is what's interesting.
4628143	4632387	This is one over in the UK, and the last issue is going out with a bang.
4633628	4641114	Details on the next Xbox, which they say is going the way of Apple and is going to be called simply Xbox.
4643835	4645276	Loki is shaking his head.
4645797	4646057	What?
4646617	4647338	That's just dumb.
4648038	4652221	And Sony's brand new TV called TV... It's called the new TV.
4652561	4657085	It's like... Thank you for not making it fucking confusing.
4657565	4659587	We're just gonna call it something else anyways.
4659747	4661448	That's just basically saying, hey, you know what?
4661768	4664210	We just didn't want to market a name that people are gonna make fun of.
4664230	4668193	We're just gonna market a name that we already had that people can make fun of or something.
4668253	4669634	To be fair, it's rumor.
4669734	4670234	We don't know.
4670314	4670795	But anyway...
4671315	4687766	8 gigs of RAM, quad core processor, it will run Blu-ray discs, supposedly going to have in the future, like some type of future add-on would be a head-mounted augmented reality device, and there will also be a next generation Kinect, which I think we all see as kind of a duh.
4688706	4697989	Anyhow, in a statement, Xbox World Editor-in-Chief Dan Dawkins said, Xbox World has been at the cutting edge of Durango coverage for over 12 months.
4698410	4706392	Unless something really dramatic changes, everything we reveal in our penultimate issue will be revealed long before E3 in June.
4706432	4709673	That was in an interview with CVG overseas.
4709854	4714015	So basically they just recapped the original leaked rumor thing that, you know.
4714244	4714924	It's not going to be glasses.
4714944	4714984	No.
4735235	4737900	You'd get into a lot of accessibility issues with glasses.
4738561	4740184	That's why the projection thing made more sense.
4740204	4743190	That's why 3D TVs aren't popular because you have to buy the glasses.
4743310	4743871	That's a good point.
4744492	4745354	And it's just...
4747395	4747775	I don't know.
4748096	4750037	It's just... No.
4750097	4756563	WhatUpG in chat says at live.vognetwork.com says Next E3 is supposed to be the coming out party for the PS4 slash 720.
4757564	4759606	You know, that's the assumption we're all making.
4760026	4763289	And it sounds like at least in Microsoft's case that'll be true.
4763869	4764089	But...
4765170	4767391	Why is this necessarily true for Sony?
4767871	4770932	Is there any indication that Sony is really going to debut this?
4770992	4772912	Or is this wishful thinking on the community's part?
4772992	4773993	I think it's all wishful thinking.
4774033	4776273	I don't think anyone's going to debut a system next year.
4776773	4778754	Oh, you think Microsoft's going to hold off too?
4778814	4780935	I think that the Wii is not going to do as well.
4781075	4784156	It's not going to take over the Xbox 360 and the PS3.
4784656	4785436	So they're just like, meh.
4785956	4786897	Why do we have to hurry?
4787397	4788418	There's really no hurry.
4803308	4803769	I guess.
4803789	4812896	I mean, if you look at what they have slated so far, what Microsoft has announced, they only have first quarter next year that's been announced, or even the first half of next year.
4813416	4815898	And Sony's kind of similar.
4815979	4818020	They've got a few things that they've announced.
4818100	4819862	They've got about three or four titles.
4820302	4824725	Those could all be first half of next year, but they haven't really... I mean, it's a little early to now.
4824765	4826747	It's the second half because you want to have something for E3.
4826767	4830529	You think The Last Office and the... What's that other big one?
4830609	4834372	The one that keeps disappearing at various E3s.
4834772	4835473	The Last Guardian?
4835553	4836553	Last Guardian, thank you.
4837214	4839856	There's no way in hell Last Guardian's out before next holiday.
4840897	4842338	And then on top of that, you still have...
4843258	4846623	Whatever happened to 13 Versus?
4846683	4847684	We don't know where that is.
4847704	4851990	I mean, that's third party, but a lot of Final Fantasy fans care.
4852210	4857377	And like it or not, 14 Reborn, that ain't happened until at least summer next year.
4858888	4863915	So, we know there is stuff on the calendar up to the holiday, at least in Sony's department.
4865096	4866318	So, that's interesting.
4866678	4869302	Well, I mean, that's not Sony, though, necessarily.
4869342	4870723	That's third-party companies.
4870763	4873888	And, obviously, you're going to have third parties, you know, putting out titles.
4873928	4877092	I mean, Tomb Raider is supposed to be... Well, that's early part of next year, but...
4878152	4883676	You still have stuff coming out for a while on there because not everyone's going to pick up.
4883956	4884856	It's just like the Wii.
4884876	4886297	The Wii's still going to have some stuff coming out.
4886537	4889339	Not anything from Nintendo, but they're going to have a few things.
4889619	4891520	Interesting comment from TigerClaw in the chat room.
4891580	4892440	What about the Ouya?
4892781	4894642	You would also have to deal with that when it comes out.
4894722	4896443	Well, the Ouya's kind of its own little thing.
4896503	4902066	I don't think any of the other guys are taking the Ouya seriously because the Ouya is such a grassroots homebrew thing.
4903046	4908368	It's like, oh, that little basement, that kid's basement toy, I honestly think that's how they view it.
4908669	4912170	Because what's the Wii going to do for the gaming experience?
4912230	4914791	Is it really going to push the gaming experience further?
4915551	4917052	No, it's just going to open up.
4917112	4919693	It's going to be like the most indie-friendly thing you've ever seen.
4919893	4925237	It's just going to be kind of similar to like how Steam, I mean, because it's kind of the way Steam's trying to go too.
4925257	4942470	I mean, they have the whole Steam Greenlight stuff to try and get your indie games on their marketplace, and then Steam Big Picture, so they kind of want to sell you a box, which they may eventually do, you know, they will eventually sell you a box that you can hook up to your TV and you just get all the Steam stuff with a controller and away you go, which would be fantastic.
4942570	4943591	I don't have a problem with that, but...
4944151	4967271	I think OUYA is trying to do something similar to that where they have got the box that they sell you which is really tiny which is awesome and then of course all these games are going to be kind of exclusive to it because they're mobile games for the most part and you'll just have to see how it takes off I don't think it's going to be huge it's not going to all of a sudden just take over the Wii or anything like that it's not going to happen it'll be like a
4967691	4968172	Roku.
4968472	4971975	A lot of people have them, but not everybody's talking about them.
4972276	4979023	Unless, you know, and it's obviously the Wii U doesn't have anything like this, but let's just say that, you know...
4980228	4988031	Let's just say that one day they decide, hey, you know what, we're going to make it so all these games that you buy from us, yeah, you can't trade them in anymore.
4988211	4992272	Or in the next consoles that come out, hey, by the way, all these games are going to be tied to your console.
4992693	4994813	Then something like that may be able to take off.
4994853	4998875	I'm seeing on Twitter that your Nintendo Network ID is tied to that console.
4998915	4999715	You can't move it.
5000095	5003036	Now, I'm seeing a lot of rage on Twitter about that.
5003236	5007698	I kind of think that's that whole, we just haven't built how to move it yet concept.
5009059	5013364	I'm giving Nintendo the benefit of the doubt that they just haven't freaking built that in yet.
5013729	5018172	Once again, reiterating what we've been saying for months now, they don't fucking get online.
5018372	5022475	I mean, they have something that resembles online right now, but they still don't fucking understand it.
5022575	5025757	And that's a real... They're making it up as they go along.
5025797	5028459	That's a real bad... I mean, come on.
5029139	5042188	This is... How late into the game are we getting into an actual functioning online and you still haven't figured... I mean, this is... This is shit that they were fucking up years ago and now they're just... I don't know.
5042388	5043569	It's amateur shit.
5045095	5048027	Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us before we get to release dates?
5048672	5050213	I have stuff and things.
5050794	5054476	So I'm sure people were interested in Black Ops 2.
5055117	5058499	Although when one of my friends posted about it as BO2, I was like, Body Odor 2?
5058960	5060861	Because that's really about as much as I care about Black Ops.
5061201	5063243	But they did something really awesomely stupid.
5064304	5072109	On the installation disk, it has the data for Mass Effect 2 on it instead.
5072570	5074191	So they're getting a much better game.
5076755	5076975	Black Ops 2
5090376	5098899	Now, I heard something, and I don't know if this ended up being true or not, but I heard something about that this was being caused because these people actually already... Oh, it's PC copies, by the way.
5099220	5099340	Yeah.
5099640	5110264	These people already had Mass Effect 2 installed on their PCs, and Mass Effect 2 had the lock on some type of file extension that Call of Duty was also, or Black Ops was also trying to use.
5110624	5113545	And so when Black Ops would call up the file, Mass Effect was loading.
5114085	5116947	Like, it seems like it's only happening to people that already had Mass Effect 2.
5118047	5118827	At least that's what I'm hearing.
5118867	5121328	I don't know if that panned out or whatever, but I know that was from the newer score.
5121469	5123850	It happened specifically with the second installation disc.
5124770	5125390	That's weird.
5125650	5126991	Yeah.
5127651	5135175	It's like people on Steam, Reddit, 4chan, they don't know who listens to 4chan anymore, and the Black Ops forums were complaining about it.
5135575	5137095	It can also be a pressing issue.
5138436	5145759	They're all duplicated, a few duplicators, and if it just happens that they're pressing copies of Mass Effect 2 and some of those happen to get in there.
5145999	5147360	Activision hasn't said shit about it, so
5147682	5152047	Well, which is funny, yeah, because that would mean Activision and EA are using the same presser.
5152688	5153529	Yeah, they do.
5154290	5159616	I mean, Technicolor, they press discs for the movie industry, for everything.
5160037	5164963	Yeah, there's only a few duplicators that are out there, and aside from Nintendo actually doing carts and stuff, but...
5167866	5171228	These all get duplicated at a few duplicators around the world.
5171488	5173069	It's just whoever they decide to use.
5173930	5179534	It's very possible that they get stuff that maybe another company is using.
5180614	5185898	Let's travel around the world and look at release dates and see what's coming to a game store near you this week.
5186471	5190493	All right, this week we've got, it's starting to slow down a little bit, so we've got a few things.
5190574	5203201	Rise of the Guardians coming out on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, the Wii, the DS, the 3DS, and yeah.
5203762	5208144	And then the 3DS version of Pro Evo Soccer 2013, although I think that date's wrong.
5208264	5210866	I believe that's actually coming out next year, if I remember correctly.
5211366	5233000	Adventure Time, Hey Ice King, Why'd You Steal Our Garbage on 3DS and DS, also collector's editions for those, Hitman Absolution on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Persona 4 Golden on the Vita, PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale on the PS3 and the Vita, also, let's see what else we got here,
5234346	5235067	Scribblenauts Unlimited on PC
5258155	5276117	PC version came out a little bit later and everything else and Family Guy Back to the Multiverse on PS3 and 360 and kids learn and play Pets and Vets I think that's a re-release the thermometer goes in the butt
5278417	5280719	and Assassin's Creed 3 on PC.
5281400	5282681	And that, I believe, is it?
5282701	5283722	What the hell is this?
5283943	5284904	Kids learn and play.
5285664	5288287	It's like a bundle, but I have never seen these.
5289068	5292070	Oh, yeah, it's some value games.
5292671	5293051	It's crap.
5293091	5293432	Don't buy it.
5295794	5297915	That in-depth review brought to you by Loki.
5297976	5298236	All right.
5299096	5302398	Let's go to the Japanese release dates and what's coming out over there.
5302459	5312225	On November 22nd on the Xbox 360, Doom 3, the BFG edition, as well as Call of Duty Black Ops 2, this is the version with subtitles, is released in Japan.
5312265	5318049	There's also an Xbox Live special membership card to celebrate the Call of Duty release in Japan.
5319350	5323012	On the PlayStation 3, Call of Duty Black Ops 2 is out there as well.
5323052	5323933	Same with Doom 3.
5324033	5325214	There's some more stuff, though, as well.
5325774	5327275	Some games getting price reductions.
5327395	5330996	Grand Theft Auto 4, Infamous 2, Killzone 3, LittleBigPlanet 2.
5331136	5332417	All of them getting price reductions.
5332797	5339019	As far as new games go on the PlayStation 3, Mina No Golf 6, EX Troopers, Chaos Head.
5339039	5340200	That's everybody's golf.
5340640	5347562	Chaos Head Love Choo Choo and Chaos Head Noah as well as a double pack of both games are out there as well.
5348203	5348343	And...
5349844	5357775	You know what that is?
5358536	5359778	Space Battleship Yamato?
5359798	5360338	Oh.
5360358	5361560	In other words, Starblazers?
5362481	5362602	Oh.
5362802	5366207	Luxury limited edition and regular edition in Japan this week.
5367663	5374789	and a classic white slim console comes out if you need to get your Japanese PlayStation 3.
5376210	5378872	Looking at the other systems real quick, let me check on the Vita.
5379693	5384576	There's just another 3G Wi-Fi pack out this week that has Mineno Golf 6 with it.
5385157	5386258	So there's that, yay.
5387118	5388098	on the 3DS.
5388639	5390439	EX Troopers is out there as well.
5391520	5395921	On the 23rd, Pokemon Fushigi no Dungeon.
5396101	5398002	I'm assuming that's the Pokemon Dungeon Crawler game.
5398642	5399662	Fushigi is mysterious.
5400182	5404084	Oh, I keep wanting to say Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon, but it's a Pokemon game.
5404104	5405064	Pokemon Mysterious Dungeon.
5405084	5406504	Pikachu's Mysterious Dungeon or whatever.
5408866	5416028	Ochi, Manichi, Tamagotchi on the 3DS because Tamagotchi, yes, is still a thing, believe it or not.
5416348	5420769	You know, I saw Furbies at Toys R Us the other day, so what's old is new again.
5420869	5422169	I blocked Furby on Facebook.
5422829	5433371	Now, the Wii U, keep in mind, not out over there in Japan until December the 8th, so we don't have those release dates for a little bit, but we'll work those into the rotation soon.
5433771	5436892	Otherwise, we'll go to Jamie for what's coming out in the UK.
5437702	5438283	Some stuff.
5438743	5439023	The end.
5439083	5439444	No, I'm kidding.
5440344	5447731	On the 18th, Epic Mickey 2, Power of Illusion, and The Power of Two, Udraw Studio.
5448051	5451954	On the 20th, we have Hitman Absolution, Planetside, Next.
5452234	5454256	21st, The Walking Dead, Episode 5, No Time Left.
5455397	5461142	23rd, Assassin's Creed 3, Rise of the Guardians, Talisman Prologue.
5462243	5463044	And that's it.
5464522	5468865	All right, just a few more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.
5469245	5470686	And I think we've got some Sony news.
5470746	5473208	We've talked Nintendo, we've talked Microsoft, but Loki?
5473868	5481593	Yeah, they're finally, well, they announced already that PlayStation Plus would be coming to the Vita, and they've now announced which day it's going to be coming out.
5481613	5483574	It's going to be coming out tomorrow, on the November 19th.
5484194	5489558	And what's kind of awesome with that is they're also adding some games to the Instant Game Collection that will be available for the Vita.
5490338	5512417	and this includes some full Vita games including Uncharted, Golden Abyss, Jet Set Radio which is actually set to come out next week, Wipeout 2048, Gravity Rush, Tales from Space, Mutant Blobs Attack and I guess Final Fantasy Tactics, The War of the Lions that was a PSP title and that's
5512837	5513277	Not bad.
5513678	5519161	Of course, PlayStation Plus, $18 for three months or $50 for the full year.
5519361	5532248	And I guess, obviously, if you have a PlayStation Plus membership, you also get all the free wonderful games library stuff with the PS3 and the one gigabyte of cloud storage, which is pretty awesome.
5532668	5534429	And I guess a gigabyte of cloud storage on the Vita.
5534489	5535950	I wonder if that's the same one gigabyte.
5536711	5539012	Is your Vita actually going to come out of storage now at this point?
5539488	5540368	Well, it's in my backpack.
5540668	5542449	Is it going to come out of your backpack?
5543909	5548931	No, because I have to actually become a member of PlayStation Plus and I just don't want to right now.
5549251	5550051	I'm excited.
5550151	5552872	I'm PlayStation Plus and I couldn't be more excited about this.
5552952	5555533	I'm like, oh my god, it's like Christmas on my Vita tomorrow.
5555573	5556373	It's going to be great.
5556913	5558653	So yeah, I'm looking forward to it.
5558934	5560554	Vita's relevance is finally starting to come out.
5561587	5562628	Just in time for the holidays.
5563669	5570093	Alright, well, also coming to the Vita, I think this is also tomorrow with the PlayStation Plus update, obviously.
5570633	5572515	A whole new firmware, 2.0.
5573395	5575897	A new email application for the Vita.
5575917	5581101	That's kind of interesting, but, well, it makes the 3G a little more lucrative, especially if you don't have a phone that does it.
5581261	5582202	With the coolest...
5582962	5584343	PlayStation's typing interface.
5585223	5586964	I get what they're doing.
5588565	5590346	It's easier to use than iPhone, honestly.
5590906	5591346	I think so.
5592226	5592807	On the Vita?
5593147	5593767	Heck yeah.
5594768	5599510	It's easier to have the key directly instead of having to memorize what it's under.
5601251	5603594	The Vita has that tanky style mode.
5603615	5608621	You can type on the keyboard and it's really responsive and fits a large part of the screen.
5608641	5609963	Oh, the Vita is a touchscreen, isn't it?
5610243	5611425	Okay, disregard.
5611465	5616492	You're thinking about Sony's PlayStation 3 predictive text, which the Vita will do as well.
5617113	5617874	So it has that.
5618334	5619335	I'll be over here if you need me.
5620617	5621679	That's alright.
5621779	5627987	Gmail, Yahoo, and other miscellaneous providers unsaid will be supported.
5628808	5631732	Also, finally, this is so dumb that they didn't have this before.
5632213	5635798	Wirelessly transmit between the PC and the Vita.
5636338	5642723	Also, browser and video apps will now do 1080p videos even though it's not like it's going to magically change the output.
5642763	5645445	What about wireless transmitting between the PS3 and the Vita?
5646045	5650448	That's not said, but I would think if it's wireless between the PC, why not?
5650488	5651989	Yeah, I think it would be on the PlayStation 3.
5652089	5655051	I want to say I read that somewhere else that it will do that too.
5655111	5655732	Thank God.
5656312	5657573	Makes so much more sense.
5658234	5659715	So, very cool.
5659955	5662276	That's all coming as well this week.
5663177	5664517	DarkSakura is taking it back this week.
5686707	5687207	I am.
5687788	5691989	The game of the week is Yars' Revenge for the Atari 2600.
5692570	5694110	Yars, not Yaris.
5696211	5697292	This is a great pick.
5697832	5709297	It's also a game that particularly illustrates the proper way to use an apostrophe with something that ends in an S. Although, to be honest, if they were ever going to make a second Yars game, Yars' Revenge would be kind of fun to play.
5710396	5711436	Be like Christine.
5712417	5715338	You know, words that don't seem to be ours.
5715438	5715978	Anyway.
5716598	5724742	Anyway, it came out in 1982 and it was created by Howard Scott Warshall who wrote Raiders of the Lost Ark and E.T.
5726246	5728047	But we forgive him because of Yars' Revenge.
5728067	5728907	That's right.
5729047	5731428	For every bad game he made, there was a good game.
5731528	5734509	And let's not forget he was under tremendous pressure with E.T.
5735009	5736049	Read his side of it.
5736149	5737890	You'll feel a lot of sympathy for the guy.
5737930	5742231	Which isn't that like the plot of the Angry Video Game Nerds movie now?
5742691	5745132	Trying to find where all the cartridges of E.T.
5745232	5745332	are?
5745392	5745892	Who cares?
5746012	5747253	I care about the real story.
5747293	5747753	No offense.
5748473	5760840	Well, anyway, it was supposed to be a licensed port of a game called Star Castle, which there's a cannon that's protected by these counter-rotating shields, and you have to shoot holes in the shields to destroy the cannon inside.
5761740	5764162	But then again, once you shoot the holes, the cannon can shoot you.
5765302	5765923	So, um...
5767099	5768380	Kill or be killed.
5769500	5775223	Anyway, so as they were developing the Atari version, it actually changed quite a bit.
5775663	5789410	So now your hero is called a yar, which is like a little insect thing that nibbles through the layer, and then it can shoot his cannon into the breach and kill the evil Kotile, which I think is how it was said.
5790551	5791711	who is on the other side of the barrier.
5792712	5802939	Although you can be shot at through the barrier, and it turns into a swirl.
5803440	5808824	However, you're warned before you get shot at, and you can go back to the other side of the little energy wall.
5809684	5813227	Which, I swear the first time I saw that I was like, is my TV fucked up?
5814335	5816396	but no, it's a party game.
5816456	5817857	It's also a little safe zone.
5817937	5820098	The neutral zone.
5820318	5824360	The swirls can get you but the little torpedoes cannot and you cannot shoot from within the neutral zone.
5825996	5841840	So you've got different scoring, and the highest thing you can get is if you shoot one of those swirls in mid-air with the Zorlon Cannon, which is this little shooty thing, you get 6,000 points and an extra life, but you can get only up to 9 lives.
5842601	5847002	And each level ends when you kill the Kotyl or the swirl.
5848002	5856345	So, uh, basically when you reach 70,000 points, the shield will turn blue, and the swirls come out with more frequency.
5856465	5866409	If you get 150,000, the shield turns gray, and, you know, even more crap comes out, and you get a guided missile, it's gonna get ya.
5866429	5874633	230,000 points, the shield turns pink, and the swirls will begin to fire three times more frequently, and not give you warnings.
5875333	5876655	There was a comic book that came out with it.
5877215	5889789	It had a mini comic book that was in the game package and it gave the story behind the game and why it was seeking vengeance because apparently the thingy blew up their world.
5891579	5892779	And then there was an album.
5893400	5896601	It had a theme song and a radio drama of the comic book.
5897621	5898341	So that was kind of neat.
5898361	5900922	There's also an Easter egg in the game.
5901002	5907004	If you kill a swirl in midair, a black vertical line appears on the screen across the spot where the swirl was shot.
5908544	5914049	The line is referred to in the manual as Ghost of Yars and warns the player to stay off the mean streak.
5914589	5928400	If the player moves vertically along that line and is about 1-2 inches below the middle of the screen when the explosion closes, the game will end and go into a game select screen with the programmer's initials HSW that's forward and backwards on the word select.
5929941	5934625	If you do it in game 6 or 7, JOV appears which is under the creator's initials.
5935285	5938668	There was a remake for the Game Boy Color in 1999.
5939108	5943031	In 2005, of course, it came out on the Atari Flashback 2.
5943651	5946093	There's a 3 and 1 that came on the GBA in 2005.
5947314	5949576	And that also came with Pong and Asteroids.
5950376	5951837	It's available on Game Room in 2010.
5951897	5955540	There's a reimagining that came out on Xbox Live Arcade.
5957702	5960744	And actually, I think it's not out yet on PS3.
5960764	5961925	They said they were going to be doing it.
5962842	5963663	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5982756	5985679	and it's supposed to be a lot more like the 2600 game.
5985719	5986360	I haven't played it.
5987341	5995390	And there's another one that's free on browsers that supports HTML5 that is on Atari.com with other classic Atari games.
5996371	6000856	And there's a sequel called Yar's Return that's on the Atari Flashback too.
6001437	6001697	The end.
6002725	6004005	There it is, your classic game of the week.
6004065	6006746	A real classic going way back to the Atari 2600.
6006846	6008087	Yars' Revenge.
6008267	6010688	Undoubtedly one of the best 2600 games they ever did.
6011988	6012548	Absolutely.
6013129	6013569	All right.
6013609	6014929	Well, we are going to take a break, guys.
6014949	6030235	When we come back, we've got more of Orange Laundry to come, including rapid-fire news, the Google Question of the Week, some other gaming-related news, and a hilarious follow-up to something I said last week would probably not go away anytime soon.
6030255	6030615	The futures!
6031356	6032038	It's really funny.
6032058	6036209	We'll get to that in just a little bit when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6043548	6052114	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live with episode number 482 of our show for this November the 18th of 2012.
6052914	6057517	We're going to get into some rapid fire news, but first I got to ask Loki.
6057577	6058338	Loki's over there.
6058758	6061920	He's like, all right, let me touch the Wii U tablet.
6062800	6064121	He's going to touch the Wii.
6064882	6066623	All right, Loki, touch the Wii U tablet.
6067351	6067912	I like it.
6068072	6074376	I think it has a good, for such a big frickin' thing, it's got a really nice feel to it.
6075257	6082822	It's, I mean, as far as the placements of the analog sticks, they're comfortable, but hitting, like, the buttons below it is not quite comfortable.
6083262	6094670	Like, if you're trying to hit the A, like, the A button, if there was a game that you were using, you know, like First Versus Shooters and stuff, where the A button might be used, that is a bit, you know, that could cramp up your hand pretty bad.
6094830	6098491	You know what's strange about that?
6100291	6107473	I felt that in the menus, and I think this might be more related to the Xbox 360 controller since they just flipped where the buttons are.
6107933	6114555	I kind of noticed that problem in the menus, but the couple of games that I was playing through didn't really have finger placement issues.
6116875	6126937	Well, if you want to follow me on Miiverse, again, I said this quickly in the first part of the show, but if you did pick up a Wii U and you want to follow me on Miiverse, my name on the Wii, really creative, y'all, Rob Roberts.
6127698	6128218	All one word.
6128918	6129158	I know.
6129478	6130298	Really tough to figure out.
6130938	6131218	All right.
6131658	6138540	Let's travel through some rapid-fire news and talk quickly about what else is going on in the gaming world.
6138620	6139300	Not just a Wii.
6141454	6143336	StarCraft II, Heart of the Swarm
6161915	6169003	and of course the Digital Deluxe and Collector's Edition version will be available as well priced at $59.99 and $79.99 respectively.
6170264	6180516	And the Digital Deluxe version like anything else that is Blizzard will contain stuff that doesn't necessarily apply to the game that you're buying which doesn't make any fucking sense to me.
6181096	6194890	You get a pet for World of Warcraft and a new sigil for Diablo 3 Someone explain this to me Why the fuck would I buy a collector's edition for one game to get shit for another game?
6194910	6198894	That doesn't make any goddamn sense Because you're already playing the other game, especially WoW
6199494	6202155	There's a lot of Blizzard crossover in the fandom.
6202515	6210796	I would say there's more synergy within that fandom than almost any other type of company with the exception of maybe Squeenix.
6211456	6212296	Pre-Eidos.
6212597	6214977	And you can get StarCraft Pets in WoW.
6215437	6217077	Yeah, there's a lot of that crossover.
6217137	6219498	But Sigils, really?
6220338	6220738	Really?
6221778	6222718	That's a bit of a stretch.
6223519	6224439	But what else are they going to give you?
6224499	6225559	A freaking legendary drop?
6226064	6226544	I don't know.
6226604	6229045	I mean, it's just kind of dumb that they have that.
6229625	6233946	Behind the scenes DVD slash Blu-ray and soundtrack.
6234106	6237827	Also, Heart of the Swarm hardcover art book and Zerg Rush mouse pad.
6238908	6240148	Let me put it this way, okay?
6241128	6244449	Rational people out there, just don't fucking buy the collector's edition.
6244489	6250711	You don't need to spend $40 extra for a pet in WoW and a goddamn mouse pad.
6251391	6252572	It's not just...
6254012	6254612	Resist.
6254973	6255653	You can do it.
6255813	6256693	I mean, seriously.
6257534	6259955	But if you are an addict and bought it, give me the pet.
6261255	6264637	I would be glad to give you mine because otherwise the code will be completely unredeemed.
6265878	6266198	Okay.
6266398	6269219	Do you have the one from the original StarCraft 2 release?
6269359	6269799	No, I do not.
6269879	6270079	Okay.
6270320	6271720	I will send that your way when I get home.
6272300	6272761	Yes.
6273281	6274101	So I win.
6274241	6274701	I win.
6274782	6275502	Rob, you can't have it.
6275542	6276983	Sorry, you're making food and not in the room.
6277323	6277903	Disqualified.
6280590	6285432	Um, so PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale comes out next week, and they've already announced their first bit of DLC.
6285492	6286152	What, D?
6286592	6287553	Early DLC?
6287633	6288493	What the fuck?
6288633	6288933	Why?
6289033	6289833	I'm not paying for DLC.
6289953	6291934	Well, good, you don't have to, because it's actually free.
6292454	6306159	And the two characters they're going to be adding to the roster include, um, Kat, who is from Gravity Rush, the Vita game, and, um, I guess Emmett Graves, who is the character from Starhawk.
6306619	6332772	and what's kind of cool is apparently the unique gameplay styles from both of those games are going to cross over into it including Kat's ability to manipulate gravity and Emmet's ability to kind of call the support stuff from Starhawk the build as you kind of go type thing so that's pretty neat and free DLC is always awesome and it's kind of cool to see if they're going to be expanding this game so
6334452	6343175	Maybe when the Game of the Year edition comes out with all the characters and they're making certain picking it up, but still pretty neat.
6343315	6351939	And last but not least, and I've actually used this company before, FigurePrints is actually doing something now with Minecraft where you can actually export a part of your world
6352879	6355261	and have it printed in 3D.
6355822	6359726	That's right, your own Minecraft world creations in 3D.
6360467	6368875	And you just have to download the app that's on the Fingerprints website, just fingerprints.com slash Minecraft.
6369956	6392350	and you can go check it out and I guess the price is very depending on the size of your model that you're having printed and they kind of give some examples and they're pretty cool looking I had gotten one from my Xbox 360 avatar so I actually have an avatar you know 3D avatar of myself at my desk which is pretty awesome
6393170	6398954	But, yeah, it doesn't really say how much it would cost for your creations.
6399414	6405058	I mean, there would be some cool stuff I'd want to make from our world, but I'd have to see how much this is.
6406279	6408060	Looks like it may only be like one chunk.
6409441	6413443	I'm thinking it might be one chunk, but neat.
6414224	6414684	Kind of cool.
6414844	6415224	Looks cool.
6415504	6415665	Yeah.
6416710	6432557	Moving on, classic Dragon Quest fans will rejoice in the news that the Heartbeat Studio that originally developed the games in the Super Nintendo and PS1 games that closed shortly thereafter is up for a revival as the Genius Sonority.
6433357	6437559	They previously worked on Pokemon Colosseum, Dragon Quest Swords, and the Dinpamin.
6437719	6439060	They came by wave.
6439800	6448210	Manaba Yamana revealed by Twitter that Heartbeat will be relaunched after a decade, starting early next year with a new business perspective.
6448811	6453957	According to Inside Games, Yamana said to expect a new webpage with more information next year.
6454397	6457100	Can only imagine what their debut title is going to be.
6458799	6461660	Origin has been hit by a series of security breaches.
6461780	6466663	As users come to find out, their accounts have been cracked and personal details have been leaked.
6467703	6468263	Sigh.
6468503	6473465	To make matters worse, EA's own security measures ensure victims aren't resolving the issue.
6473525	6481189	Because it's so unable to log back in, change your email address back, change your password, certain things along those lines.
6482069	6493353	Users affected by the attack are told that their email address is invalid whenever they try to log in, and as soon as they call EA to find out what's wrong, they get shut down by representatives who can't help them without a receipt and valid date of birth.
6494173	6495954	S. M. H.
6496385	6499787	Yes, with validated birth courses being changed by said hacker.
6500827	6507670	Because, you know, that has to be something that will change because you will mysteriously be born at a different date than you once were.
6508731	6510151	God bless web development.
6510491	6515314	NeoGAF has managed to compile tens of thousands of threads.
6515334	6516214	Well, that wouldn't surprise me.
6516274	6524458	Ten threads of complaints on EA's official forums and just a sample of the overall total of grief being expunged on the internet.
6524998	6526941	If you use Origin, do your due diligence.
6527282	6532669	Unique password, make sure all your stuff is correct so you at least have a remote chance of getting back into your account.
6533430	6534171	Be internet safe.
6534792	6540160	Since you brought up NeoGAF, I don't visit that site an awful lot because it's a little too busy and I have too much ADD.
6541781	6567351	but there was like the most winning thread I've ever seen on a web forum was on NeoGAF this week and it had to do with photoshopping your favorite or no a descriptive animated gif as the box art for a game like I'm describing this and I'm doing a terrible job but like there was this great like somebody photoshopped a box art for Tokyo Jungle and it was like these two kitties and a dog all wrestling and it was really funny like there was just all this kind of stuff
6567871	6570632	Grand Theft Auto 5 with a cop taking some guy out.
6570873	6574995	It's like all these great animated GIFs from around the internet on video game box art.
6575175	6578396	That's absolutely nothing to do with what you just talked about, but I like GIFs.
6579497	6580097	Who doesn't?
6581598	6585159	And two days ago was officially Miyamoto's 60th birthday.
6585960	6588401	Not too much need to be said for a man like him.
6588621	6596225	Imagine how the state of games would be different had Shigeru Miyamoto and Nintendo and the entire uprising that has happened on the last...
6597105	6599486	Three decades not actually occurred.
6600926	6601366	Uprising?
6602087	6602747	Bad choice of words.
6602787	6603307	Upchucking?
6604387	6608408	In some cases, like the value Wii games, I suppose.
6608829	6610109	How about Uther News?
6610849	6611309	Uther News?
6611629	6617031	Tom Hardy is going to be playing the lead in Splinter Cell for the movie version.
6617171	6617731	Sam Fisher.
6618612	6618912	Good.
6619512	6625934	However, he's also slated to join Michael Fassbender in an Assassin's Creed film.
6626294	6626434	So...
6628355	6654095	also god as if this wasn't enough who remembers Barkley Shut Up and Jam well the group that did Barkley Shut Up and Jam Gaiden the sequel that was all completely parody have a new kickstarter up to make a game called Magical Realms of Tirnanog Escape from Necron 7 Revenge of Kokolin the official game of the movie chapter 2 of the Hoops Barkley saga that's awesome
6655259	6657580	And then Jet Set Radio Vita will be out November 20th.
6658161	6661763	And a mobile version will be out in nine days after for iOS and Android.
6662043	6662383	The end.
6663764	6665865	Let's get to the foogle question of the week.
6674089	6677771	Take Facebook and Google Plus and slam... Yes, people are on Google Plus.
6678031	6679852	And slam them together and you get foogle.
6679872	6680673	Make him do it.
6680713	6682034	Make him have retarded babies.
6683835	6684095	What?
6686465	6686965	Fugle.
6687306	6688266	Go Fugle yourself.
6689207	6689527	All right.
6691549	6697874	Every week we ask a question on our Fugle communities and we get answers and we read some of our favorite answers on the show.
6699575	6704219	We have a lot of responses this week because I actually planned ahead this week and asked the question a whole day early.
6704319	6706801	So you're very welcome that we get more participation this week.
6707481	6714468	Very controversial article going around the internet this week because, you know, how else do you get hits for your website?
6714508	6720354	Stir up some controversy like determining the all-time 100 best video games.
6720435	6726201	Now, usually, I wouldn't give two shits about a list like this because everybody's got one on their site, whatever.
6727181	6728222	Timemagazine.com
6746139	6752387	Now, I don't have time to read the entire list here, but just to give you an idea of some of the things they named.
6753048	6754710	The Oregon Trail was on there.
6756753	6758475	Mass Effect 3 was on there.
6761814	6787240	when I looked at the list I saw it as a little more like these are influential games not necessarily the best games but games that were felt and there's only two games from this decade on the entire list from the 2010s Mass Effect 3 and Batman Arkham City which, well, Batman Arkham City was a pretty fucking great game too both pretty worthy both pretty worthy
6788501	6794469	The oldest games on the list from the 1970s The Oregon Trail, Hunt the Wumpus Does anyone remember that?
6794569	6802679	I actually remember the Wumpus game Pong, Breakout, Space Invaders, Adventure, and Asteroids
6803120	6803641	No Guardian Legend
6821337	6823779	They did Final Fantasy 7, and yes, no Guardian Legend.
6824079	6824780	Bastards!
6825280	6826261	They picked 7.
6826301	6827743	That is amazing justification.
6827983	6828603	I can see.
6828683	6828984	I can see.
6829004	6829264	All right.
6829864	6835509	Well, look, we asked you guys on Google Plus and on Facebook, we're sure many of you saw this list.
6835589	6842936	What was your impression of the list, being that Time is more of a news organization than something that typically caters to entertainment?
6843296	6844437	Were they mostly right?
6844637	6846739	Were there any glaring omissions or issues?
6847499	6849902	Here's some of the answers from Google+.
6851063	6856149	Kevin R replied and said, I think Wii Sports should not be on this list.
6856870	6860894	What about cult followings like Disgaea and .hack and Persona?
6861314	6863557	Let's see some that are not for the mainstream.
6865086	6869448	Kevin, I'm totally with you on the second half, but Wii Sports not being on the list.
6869488	6870829	Well, here's the thing.
6872530	6875892	The fact that it's Time Magazine is why Wii Sports is on the list.
6876072	6878393	This was not EGM or some game.
6878773	6884036	You have to remember, Wii Sports broke the mainstream in a way very few video games have.
6884116	6886317	It is the top-selling video game ever.
6887137	6887858	Am I not right?
6887878	6889219	100% agree.
6890959	6900902	Very unfortunate for us and what we do, our feelings and what we say, but Wii Sports is the number one reason why, as you said before, the Wii was such a runaway sale, period.
6901042	6901902	But I get it.
6901922	6906523	I'm not here to argue with listeners who are commenting on Google for the first time.
6906804	6907584	I'm not doing that.
6907984	6913645	But I'm just saying, think about it this way, because even though it's a gamer, you might be like, there really isn't much of a game here.
6913685	6915306	I'm just flailing about here, but...
6915806	6917027	Only way bowling counts.
6917347	6920388	That flailing got sold a hell of a lot of systems.
6922269	6929133	Elliot B says, I disagree that Batman Arkham City and Mass Effect 3 are the best games of the 2010s.
6929573	6932415	Portal 2 and Minecraft are far better.
6933855	6935876	You know, Portal 2 I'll give you.
6936357	6937897	Minecraft, vomit.
6938938	6940359	Until someone buys me a copy.
6941319	6943820	I'm sorry, but your opinion doesn't count on Minecraft.
6945538	6947720	I know that sounds harsh, but I'm sorry.
6948740	6949781	Here's the thing I do want to say.
6949821	6951823	To be fair, Portal 1 is on the list.
6952303	6954585	And so they did the whole no sequels thing.
6954665	6958107	So I'm okay with Portal 1 topping Portal 2.
6959348	6963992	Minecraft, I think that's one of those let it age like a wine games.
6965211	6971075	I think in five more years, I think we haven't really felt Minecraft's influence yet.
6971755	6982442	Batman Arkham City and Mass Effect 3 were final games in long-running series, or the latest games in long-running series.
6982522	6984523	They had a little different battle to that list.
6987085	6987385	Let's see.
6989412	6991034	Robert G picked up on something.
6991374	6993676	It was a good list, but it had some editing problems.
6993916	6997200	Atari's adventure screenshot was not from the actual game.
6997780	7003105	I have to see if that is... Is that not from the game?
7003165	7003946	I'm trying to look at it.
7004367	7005448	I guess maybe not.
7005568	7010232	I mean, it looks like a game screenshot, but I'm thinking like, when do you take the red dragon there?
7010292	7011894	Weren't they all in front of little castles?
7012314	7013876	Or could you move them around?
7015370	7036103	I think someone like googled that and said let's use this one probably probably it could have been like you know it could have been like a hacked image or something like that maybe so I think they could have found a better one it's like when you go to the movie and like the scene you saw in the trailer isn't in the movie which happens all the time it happens all the time now that was a big thing in TV commercials for a while too
7037931	7039232	Yeah, TV commercials for shows.
7039272	7040072	Yeah, all the time.
7040293	7040673	All the time.
7040993	7043455	All right, that was some of the answers from Google+.
7043475	7046577	I'm sorry I didn't read them all, but there's some good stuff there, so I hope you will check them out.
7047177	7048838	Let me read some of the answers from Facebook.
7048958	7063768	Critical Myth, also on the VOG Network, replies, starting off, It was a nice walk through gaming nostalgia, but whenever it comes to lists like these, they can't possibly take our subjective likes and dislikes and personal histories into account to match our expectations or preferences.
7064529	7065649	A very good reminder.
7067773	7070339	But hey, we still have to argue about it anyway, right?
7071331	7084438	Tiara, our good buddy Tiara from geek-life.com replies and says, Don't get me wrong, Final Fantasy Tactics is one of my favorite games, but how did that make it on the list, but Final Fantasy 4 and 6 didn't?
7084998	7087780	Overall, a lot of good choices, but some questionable ones as well.
7088260	7092442	Well, Tiara, I'm pretty sure 4 and 6 didn't make the list because 7 did.
7092663	7092903	Yes.
7093243	7099486	And now we're going to go back and have that old argument about Final Fantasy 7, so I'll just let that be.
7099806	7100827	Interesting that they did jump.
7103391	7110742	Not that the Final Fantasy universe was canonical from release to release, but interesting that they would jump out to Tactics in addition to 7.
7111553	7111973	Breath of Fire
7134944	7137006	It's a big list.
7137046	7138727	Well, I have a quesadilla in my mouth.
7138967	7141769	Well, I mean, I'm just using it as an example.
7141809	7146352	Did they do Tactics Ogre or anything that was that same style of gameplay?
7146753	7160542	Because Final Fantasy Tactics really, I think, took out sort of something that was almost niche, like just slightly outside the niche level, and really brought it into mainstream because it was a big name that everyone recognized.
7160562	7161223	I would agree with that.
7161503	7164784	I'm scanning this list real quick trying to look for tactical games.
7165104	7166684	Desktop Tower Defense.
7167504	7168725	I don't even know what that game is.
7168805	7171545	It sounds like it could be tactical.
7172266	7173086	It's Tower Defense.
7173106	7174066	That's about all you have to say.
7176086	7179927	Well, but look at all the fucking Tower Defense games we have now.
7180367	7181388	That's a huge part of iOS.
7182128	7183288	No, I agree with it on the list.
7183428	7186089	I'm saying the genre... How dare you disagree?
7189192	7205674	not a lot of other tactical games on the list I don't see a lot of those other games you were mentioning I definitely agree with Jamie's point is that they took a beautiful world with a great story gave it a similar enough engine and it is one of the only strategy games to hit as wide adoption as it did
7207118	7209741	Let's see some of the other answers from Facebook.
7210501	7213224	Daniel S replied and said, yeah, didn't bother with the list.
7213604	7215926	They're just bait for more page clicks.
7216406	7219029	Check out IGN's top 100 RPGs list.
7219309	7220690	They put Persona 4 at number 90.
7221251	7222612	I stopped reading lists after that.
7223112	7229533	While I don't totally disagree with you, one reason I picked this list in particular is that it is Time Magazine.
7229714	7231594	It's not a video game site.
7231714	7232654	It's like a news site.
7232754	7237575	So, you know, while yes, to some extent, it probably still is bait for page clicks.
7237635	7238676	Most things on the internet are.
7239316	7243737	I kind of felt there was still that history behind the publication.
7243817	7246337	It would be different if this is something they were putting in their magazine.
7247257	7249558	In actual print publication, but it's not.
7250842	7254564	I don't... Has Time done an actual video game issue?
7255405	7257846	I don't think... Well, in the 80s probably.
7258587	7264610	But I don't think we've had anything modern coming out there where they actually go into the economics behind it, where they go into the social aspects behind it.
7264630	7268893	Because that's something I would put more along the line of Time Magazine's caliber.
7269393	7273936	That's the type of editorial I'd want to see out of Time Magazine in relation to video games, not a top 100 list.
7275681	7304592	Jonathan L with a good reply here on Facebook well they're all good but this one particularly caught my attention this seems it seems this is actually a list of games that were original for their time rather than a list of the all-time best the super NES library says hi the list also doesn't have any treasure games DS games arcade music games 3d sports games 3d fighting games MOBAs or any of the top 40 games on twitch TV right now therefore it is invalid World of Warcraft has to be in the top 40 of twitch TV
7305352	7306993	with all the arena matches that go on on there.
7307033	7309313	So I think you might have overlooked that one, but I get your point.
7309433	7310414	I hadn't even considered it.
7310494	7311734	DDR isn't a game on the list.
7311854	7314075	No, DDR was not on the list, but Guitar Hero was.
7314955	7315135	Huh.
7315155	7316415	I wonder if there's any relationship there.
7316495	7319456	Everyone knows that DDR ripped off Guitar Hero.
7320796	7321597	Here's the thing.
7322377	7328058	In America, I know this is hard for the longtime fans to hear, so just hold your breath for a minute.
7328098	7328559	Not too long.
7328599	7328959	Don't choke.
7330039	7333460	Guitar Hero made a bigger impact in the States than DDR did.
7334454	7334854	Sorry.
7334954	7335354	No?
7335474	7335794	Gray?
7336295	7336875	Truth hurts.
7337175	7337795	Sorry, guys.
7337855	7341016	I mean, I won't deny the splash that it made.
7341036	7343897	Whether it should have or not is another argument.
7344037	7345177	And I won't argue that.
7345277	7348658	Guitar Hero 1 and 2 I had a hell of a lot of fun with.
7348778	7357461	It was, you know, being the Bimani kid all throughout the 98 release up until... Oh, when did Guitar Hero come out?
7357481	7359062	07, I believe?
7359082	7359422	Yeah.
7360362	7361662	Thank you for watching!
7390351	7394375	and Guitar Hero for less presentation, more performance.
7394895	7408006	I will say, though, to give to the other side of the coin, though, because I am a longtime DDR fan, one thing that should be acknowledged about Dance Dance Revolution that the Guitar Hero can't lay claim to is that none of these video games will you find in a PE class.
7409207	7411870	But DDR is the only game to have broken that barrier, so...
7413511	7414812	D.D.R.
7414872	7416913	and a P.E.
7416953	7418294	class is kind of a new thing.
7418694	7423577	Give it five or ten years and maybe we will have accepted it a little more as a culture.
7423757	7426418	Maybe Minecraft will soon become sculpting class lessons.
7426438	7426819	Who knows?
7426999	7427279	Who knows?
7427559	7429480	All right, let me read like one more of these.
7429500	7433343	And I'm so sorry I didn't get to everybody, but I want to read this one from Degenerate Johnny.
7434363	7438886	It appears to me that most of the mainstream media focuses on commercial successes or games with a cult following.
7439306	7443569	Since this is a top 100 list, it doesn't surprise me that Time did the same thing in this scenario.
7443989	7450114	The purpose of this list was not to inform us gamers, because this is something that we can expect from a generalized top 100 list.
7450534	7455758	This list was to inform the magazine's target market, which is clearly not us gamers.
7456138	7460804	Movie buffs don't care about top 100 movie lists from magazines such as Time and People.
7461104	7461725	Why should we?
7462125	7464348	Playboy features games in almost every issue.
7464688	7465830	Should we care about this?
7466290	7471176	Only if there's a centerfold of our favorite video game female characters, or male if you read Playgirl.
7471596	7473659	Jamie, quit drooling over the centerfold of Garrus.
7474341	7474661	Really?
7475842	7477624	Gaming in every issue of Playboy?
7477804	7478164	Honestly?
7478584	7479445	I'm pretty sure they do.
7479585	7480766	It is a magazine for men.
7480946	7481287	Sure.
7482828	7483188	Wow.
7484009	7485049	It's just funny to think about.
7485069	7486330	There's not enough Turian in my life.
7487331	7493936	Okay, before the weird turn that comment took in the second half, I'm so with you on the first half.
7494036	7494317	It was...
7496378	7500343	The mainstream media focuses on commercial successes or games of the cult following.
7500383	7502205	That is where this list really came from.
7502225	7504768	For the record, I have to say one thing real quick.
7505208	7506149	Do you know what Cleverbot is?
7507631	7508192	Is that an AOL bot?
7509136	7509536	Kind of.
7509596	7510337	It's actually a website.
7510357	7511638	You type stuff in and it replies to you.
7512318	7515360	I typed in Turians and it replied, I am the very model of a scientist, Larian.
7517882	7518282	Just saying.
7518302	7520263	Because some nerd works at that website.
7520303	7520803	You know it.
7521024	7522164	Oh, there's portal ones on here too.
7522384	7522625	All right.
7522645	7524826	Thank you to everybody on both Facebook and Google+.
7524906	7528068	I'm sorry if I didn't read your answer, but we are running a little long tonight.
7528148	7531170	I encourage you to visit both of our communities on Google+.
7531230	7532431	Search for Orange Lounge Radio.
7532891	7535633	or on Facebook, go to facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio.
7535914	7540257	I encourage you to go and read all of the responses and click like or plus one.
7540698	7543200	Or if you're on the Wii U, you can click yeah.
7544753	7544974	Yeah!
7545014	7545234	Yeah!
7567255	7569677	Loki, I think you should go work for Nintendo.
7570037	7571398	Oh, because I know what the internet is?
7571938	7575060	Instead of like, what is this internet you speak of?
7575500	7576341	You'd be surprised.
7576541	7576961	Why not?
7578822	7581384	We have to make screen name.
7581424	7586707	We'll attach it to the console and if their console breaks... Our consoles never break!
7586887	7587007	You...
7588268	7588908	Death to you!
7588968	7589349	I don't know.
7591050	7591690	Alright, Loki.
7592410	7593191	How about some real news?
7593971	7594792	Some real news?
7594992	7595292	Okay.
7595872	7597453	Let's talk about Black Ops 2.
7597513	7599394	Black Ops 2, big surprise.
7599475	7601536	Biggest title of the year.
7602176	7603677	It has broken all sorts of records.
7604257	7610641	Modern Warfare 3, of course, sold 6.5 million copies in the US and UK.
7610661	7615704	The previous record was $400 million in the first day.
7616084	7617365	Black Ops 2 beat that
7617845	7621048	with $500 million in the first day.
7621189	7628116	So that's a lot of game and the biggest entertainment launch in history.
7629901	7654726	so hooray and I'm sure next year you'll maybe beat your record again Modern Warfare 4 will break it Black Ops 3 will break it well if there's new consoles next year though that could throw an interesting monkey wrench in the situation nah because they'll make it for the other consoles as well that's true there'll be that little while where they're making it for everything cause there's a Wii U version no Wii version are they still making Playstation 2 versions nope
7656545	7657766	That stopped with World of War.
7658186	7665248	Not as of the big titles, but I was actually glancing over when you guys were doing release dates, and I do still see some new title PlayStation 2 versions.
7665268	7666009	Pro Evo.
7667109	7671871	Which is Pro Evo, just like the Wii version, and FIFA was just like the same thing.
7672211	7673452	Those are just rehashed versions.
7673632	7674992	They're there, just saying.
7675012	7677133	New PlayStation 2 titles, crazy to me.
7677253	7684018	To be fair though, didn't we discuss on a prior show that really the only PlayStation 2 game that's left to come out is the Final Fantasy XI expansion?
7684058	7685579	I want to say that came up in a prior show.
7685959	7687961	That like, here's what you have to look forward to in 2013.
7689522	7690443	One PlayStation 2 game.
7691243	7692104	XI expansion?
7692404	7692704	Mm-hmm.
7693245	7694165	Oh, duh.
7694225	7694526	Never mind.
7694766	7694886	Yeah.
7695791	7696151	All right.
7697112	7698853	So yeah, lots of money.
7700014	7700354	All right.
7700734	7703456	Moving on to LEGO Lord of the Rings.
7703556	7705237	I know some of y'all are excited about The Hobbit.
7706058	7709100	And so, of course, up comes all the new tie-in games with this.
7709480	7715004	So there's LEGO Lord of the Rings, which I guess, granted, LEGO is kind of its own little monster gaming series.
7715164	7720567	But regardless, the Xbox 360 version of this came out just this past week.
7720908	7722268	But here's something crazy.
7723402	7730524	I guess some demo discs, as opposed to retail game discs, got shipped out to retailers.
7730804	7731124	Not quite.
7731805	7732225	Oh, really?
7732885	7739147	The retail discs actually got shipped out, but they were labeled as demo discs.
7739187	7742608	They weren't actually demo discs, it's just a demo copy on it.
7742768	7748353	But what a collector's item that is, because these stories are saying, quick, you better take them back and get them exchanged.
7748753	7749774	Hell no, you shouldn't.
7749834	7750855	Hang on to that thing.
7750895	7754298	That's going to be money to some collector.
7754559	7756240	It's only a small, it's not all of them.
7756380	7759263	Like, in fact, all the ones we got shipped were not like that.
7759803	7764207	Microsoft to Walmart, Target, and Toys R Us is the places you're going to find this.
7764347	7766349	So not mom pod distribution.
7766389	7766850	Sorry, Loki.
7768603	7769703	Sorry, I got my little big planet.
7771404	7773725	So, yeah, very interesting.
7773785	7775966	So they are doing an official recall.
7776266	7779747	You can contact WB Games either by email or by phone.
7779807	7785549	But at the same time, if the disc really is the game, then hooray, you have the game.
7786149	7791191	I say enjoy it and then keep that thing in good condition because a collector may want that someday.
7791451	7791671	Maybe.
7792931	7793231	I don't know.
7811520	7817063	or the competition cartridges from Nintendo World Championships.
7817804	7820185	Oh, I thought you were going to say the Blockbuster Championship thing.
7820205	7820725	Those too.
7820865	7823206	All those cartridges go for Buku Bucks too.
7823727	7824967	Miss Prince and shit.
7825328	7826968	DarkSakura, you collect old stuff.
7827008	7828129	I have a Monopoly.
7829570	7832011	Oh, that's right, a Monopoly.
7832471	7833992	And that was on Genesis?
7834332	7835273	No, Master System.
7835833	7836754	I have two of them.
7837994	7839135	And I have an actual Monopoly.
7841283	7851006	Alright, let's move on with some more, no, not more news Yes, more news, I'm kidding I'm not with it tonight, DarkSakura
7852577	7858379	Well, in other news, and I'm going to mispronounce the name of this game because I'm not sure exactly how it's said.
7858539	7860459	Is it Arm A?
7860499	7860739	Arm A3?
7861039	7861259	Arma?
7861540	7861740	Arma 3?
7861780	7861980	Okay.
7862140	7866361	Because it's not a game I'm super interested in, but I'm pretty pissed off about the situation.
7867281	7880505	The developers, Ivan, I guess it's Busta, and Martin Peslar, have actually been held in jail for 70 days in Greece because they have been charged with espionage.
7881245	7881986	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7905247	7912992	The shooter itself was based on the island where they were arrested and they said that they were just there on holiday.
7914192	7917674	This is just a quote from Ivan's father.
7918034	7919695	They're in a cell with over 25 people.
7919755	7920616	They sleep on the ground.
7920636	7921777	They have food twice a day.
7922837	7926359	They no longer tell us on the phone that it's alright, that they're handling it.
7926959	7931402	After the court's decision, we only hear from them something no parent ever wants to hear.
7931482	7932563	Mom, Dad, please save us.
7933623	7942288	So, the people have been writing to the Czech president and prime minister saying that the foreign ministry hasn't been doing enough.
7942948	7947831	And the foreign ministry spokesperson says they're trying to work it from all angles and trying to help them out.
7948851	7951193	So, yeah.
7954334	7956115	Yeah, it's an ongoing saga.
7956315	7959777	We heard about that before and they may be in there a little while, huh?
7960278	7960978	Well, let's hope not.
7962079	7963661	Skypline at 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Launch Radio on Skype
7977796	7992642	But OpenFaint, the kind of alternative to using Game Room, at least on the iOS platform, and, well, it was one of the only kind of multi-platform kind of hubs for even the Android marketplace.
7992682	7999465	Well, you may remember Gris purchased OpenFaint, its parent company, back in April 2011.
7999525	7999765	Well, now...
8001946	8004267	OpenFaint is going to be shut down.
8004708	8009150	And they're shutting down the service starting, well, actually effective December 14th.
8009591	8015534	And in its place is going to be Grease platform that they have, which I've not experienced yet.
8016234	8019396	You know what's funny is this is what I was teasing about before the break.
8019836	8022438	One of our listeners, Picaruno, he always does these little live blogs.
8022498	8023458	He's listening to the show.
8023819	8025380	And he was listening to the podcast today.
8026100	8031103	And he said about the show, Ha ha, you just mentioned OpenFaint not going out of business.
8031503	8032624	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8060184	8066226	Early days of these networks really coming out, Aurora Faint turned into Open Faint and it was just a runaway hit.
8066946	8068327	Wasn't Aurora Faint the game?
8068347	8070247	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
8070327	8078390	Aurora Faint had its little social hub network within game and whenever they started... That was a huge game in the early days of iOS.
8078430	8084733	And whenever they opened their network, their platform to other people is how it became Open Faint that others could use.
8084833	8085693	I mean, Open Faint...
8086113	8088715	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8112062	8113144	Copyright Work Tattoos
8127463	8133546	So a tattoo artist has sued THQ, and if there's one company that can't afford a lawsuit right now, it's THQ.
8134006	8142410	But a tattoo artist sued THQ over some tattoo art that is seen in UFC Undisputed 2010 and UFC Undisputed 3.
8142510	8156057	The tattoo artist is named Chris Escobedo, and he filed a lawsuit against THQ because of a tattoo that he has copyrighted that is on MMA fighter Carlos Condit.
8156637	8157938	in these UFC games.
8158479	8167686	Now, his argument says that even though his tattoo is on this public figure, the tattoo's design still belongs to him.
8168106	8169427	He created it originally.
8169748	8172790	He never signed the rights to the design away to Condon.
8173130	8184419	So by digitally recreating the design, which THQ did, THQ is said to have, in this lawsuit, violated Escobedo's copyright on the work.
8185180	8185380	Jesus.
8185400	8185520	Jesus.
8213544	8218889	He's got a legal point, but honestly, this is just being selfish and greedy.
8219750	8221472	I mean, maybe he's got bills that need to be paid.
8221512	8223334	I don't know.
8223894	8229740	But I mean, if I did a design, you know, that's... Now, if it's something that...
8231653	8251506	wasn't being worn on a human body like if it was like say a banner or something or some like actual artwork that I put up you know as something on display and they use that like as a logo or something you specifically with the intention of making money off of it
8252125	8258190	All they did was recreate a likeness and the guy licensed his likeness, which includes everything attached to his likeness.
8271721	8273562	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8299640	8304625	If there's not a copyright filed on it, this guy has no ground to stand on.
8306407	8310271	In fact, I think it's this guy's private business.
8310751	8317678	I think that any tattoo artist, unless they're an independent contractor, license over their work to the studio they do the work for.
8318255	8323902	Loki, I want to get to your thoughts too as well as Jason if he has any but I'm going to the chat room because this is the exact same thing I thought of.
8324303	8330430	Duke Newcomb at live.vognetwork.com says, didn't the same kind of thing happen with the Tyson tattoo in the Hangover Part 2?
8330490	8331792	I believe it did.
8331852	8336438	That's the exact same thing I thought of is that they had to go like digitally redo that guy.
8336938	8337579	Loki, your thoughts?
8337659	8342120	Well, I was just going to say, I don't think it's anything that... Can you even do that?
8342160	8352184	I mean, because if you think about it, you have this copyright thing, so he can't make any public appearances anywhere because if he's captured on camera, oh, it's a copyright violation.
8352224	8355385	That seems a little stupid, like if you're putting it on somebody.
8355485	8364507	Now, if it was something blatant, like he had him tattoo Nintendo's logo on his face or something like that, then that's a little kind of... What about that guy who got the Romney tattoo?
8364527	8365988	It was all over the internet this week.
8366408	8368810	I'm actually checking with one of my favorite sites ever, Freakonomics.
8369470	8370591	I love Freakonomics.
8373072	8380497	And they're going over that case you're talking about, The Hangover Part 2, about the art appearing without the artist's consent.
8383259	8383519	Okay.
8384980	8386741	I'm going to read this paragraph here.
8387341	8387461	Okay.
8408989	8432790	and then so they're basically using it as that now they're asking does Warner Brothers have a way out the studio may claim that the tattoo is not original that it was inspired by Maori tattoos this is unlikely to work copyrights originality threshold is very low even if Whitmill adapted his design from one in the public domain it will nonetheless be copyrightable if not copied exactly if it is not copied exactly
8433922	8435806	Alright, before we move on to the mailbag, anything?
8436427	8436848	One last thing.
8437630	8441618	They say that it is also, though, quite likely protected under the Fair Use Doctrine.
8443794	8445655	Oh, interesting.
8445875	8448016	I voted for Freakonomics on Podcast Awards.
8449757	8450897	Best one in their category that I saw.
8451037	8454218	I actually had the Freakonomics desk calendar.
8454358	8456900	I used it for three years.
8456960	8457780	I would get it every year.
8458560	8460281	You learn a lot from this website.
8460821	8461521	Anyway, just saying.
8461861	8463602	But yeah, that came from Freakonomics.com.
8464423	8465523	Copyright, blah, blah.
8468179	8469400	I was going to ask the same question.
8469440	8478528	Why isn't this an issue on especially pay-per-view, mixed martial arts, pay-per-view UFC broadcasts?
8478648	8482991	Licensing, God only knows what happens behind the scenes, but I'm surprised that this hasn't come up before.
8484513	8485453	Scary situation.
8485493	8485674	The
8486694	8497002	Before having known those details, I was going to say flat out that this is Carlos Condit's problems and he's on the hook for this problem for any license agreement broken or otherwise.
8497442	8499564	I kind of agree with you.
8499824	8504888	Before you get a piece of art permanently put on your body, you better think about who owns that art.
8505008	8510252	At the same time, you want to say original or not, it's a tattoo and it's there.
8510612	8512993	Unless you're getting it on your butt where no one will ever see it.
8513633	8514593	But special people.
8514794	8517294	Clearly not the case in this situation, but of course.
8517875	8521536	Yeah, that's a really crappy situation.
8522476	8525377	Not having the expertise, I don't really want to comment anymore, but that's a scary thought.
8525417	8527018	I do still think it's a case of money grabbing.
8527418	8532921	I'm gonna get the copyright Mike Tyson tattoo on my butt and no one will ever know and I'll get away with a crime.
8534282	8540926	You know what's gonna happen is that THQ, somebody is gonna shell out damages and there's gonna be a patch that's gonna be devoted to removing this in-game.
8541106	8541466	Period.
8542006	8542707	That's the era we live in.
8542727	8547109	Either that or it's gonna be a patch that adds in a special copyright notice.
8547489	8551352	Or licensed from... A 1K patch with text alterations.
8551372	8555554	This is all time that THQ could spend working on something to make them money.
8556644	8563768	DarkSakura has asked me to dive into the mailbag tonight And I said, sure, why not I'll get my hands dirty
8574833	8578738	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8590393	8590913	DarkSakura.com
8614230	8619415	Neither do I experience this issue with any other DVDs or CDs I've put into the DVD drive recently.
8619915	8623158	Only Assassin's Creed 3 on Xbox 360 has given me this problem.
8623578	8625960	My 360 is unmodded, so that's not the problem.
8626501	8631846	Also, the Assassin's Creed 3 game disc does not appear to be broken, scratched, warped, chipped, or otherwise damaged.
8632466	8636247	I've tried searching around online and can't find anyone else experiencing this problem.
8636727	8639448	Or at least no one online is bitching about this problem.
8639869	8644830	Am I an anomaly or is anyone else experiencing this problem with Assassin's Creed 3 under 360?
8645671	8646931	Stay black, Redertainment.
8648240	8649001	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8668939	8670000	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8689355	8694681	If you have the ability to do so, I would just install the game to your drive to be safe.
8695021	8699986	Granted, you still need the game to boot the file, but I think you'll have a little more luck there.
8700927	8703891	Otherwise, I would clean the disc anyway.
8704992	8708355	You might not be able to see it, and clearly you've already established it's not your 360.
8708395	8708676	It's the disc.
8712388	8714471	and I don't own Assassin's Creed 3 so it was another game.
8714491	8717274	Try the disc in another person's system to see if it's actually the disc.
8717374	8721679	I actually want to say it was Mass Effect 2 because I bought that used and I think I had that problem.
8721699	8723381	Mass Effect 2 is fucking up all the games.
8723441	8724062	Seriously.
8725844	8730889	I'm pissed off at my Mass Effect 2 because I have the version that it does with a launcher and now I can't use text mod at the end.
8731070	8731310	Dope.
8732423	8736806	Alright, let's go to an email from Ramaditya from Indonesia.
8737627	8739588	Hi guys, it's Ramaditya from Indonesia.
8740148	8742230	I don't know if you've already known about this.
8742430	8746532	I believe you're familiar with an NES game called Blaster Master from Sunsoft.
8746753	8747093	Oh yes.
8747753	8748814	One of my all-time favorites.
8750415	8750835	You know what?
8750875	8754077	In fact, now that you brought it up, see, now I have to.
8754758	8755538	Now I have to.
8756659	8760262	You brought it up, so now I have to dig through the folder.
8760302	8761943	That means the song will be stuck in my head.
8763153	8763538	Here you go.
8770464	8770984	Much better.
8771745	8774086	In fact, it was one of my favorite games when I was a child.
8774587	8779530	Several days ago, I found out the info about the hack version of Blaster Master.
8780010	8783613	The patch allows you to play eight completely different levels from the game.
8784093	8791378	Because I cannot see, so it's impossible to tell you how good or bad it is, but my girlfriend, the one that tried the game, informed me it was great.
8791858	8800024	To know more about it, please visit the link below, and he has a link to Zofar.net, which I... My first reaction was, that site's still around?
8801045	8804088	I remember hanging out in IRC chat rooms that Zophar was in.
8804108	8804929	That was years ago.
8804969	8806230	I was in college then, okay?
8806390	8810795	Last I knew, Zophar was ad-bombed and scary as a result to go to it.
8810895	8812477	Zophar's gotta be my age.
8813357	8813838	At least.
8814258	8815860	He's mid-thirties, for sure.
8816040	8817862	Mr. International House of Roms.
8818242	8818463	Fuck.
8819023	8822666	Anyhow, to know more about it, please visit the link below.
8822686	8825488	It has the info, the game trailer, and the patch itself.
8825568	8827450	So hope it blasts your day.
8827870	8834455	Now the link here is kind of lengthy, so I'll just tell you to go to Zophar at Z-O-P-H-A-R.net if you didn't already know.
8834875	8836856	and look for Blaster Remaster.
8837476	8841077	A lot of people in the emulation scene did this shit with Mario Brothers.
8841297	8842157	I can't tell you.
8842237	8853501	When hacking and sprite changing, when Nesticle implemented, and yes, that's what it was called, when Nesticle implemented the sprite changing abilities, Super Penis Brothers was out within minutes.
8854541	8856742	Everybody did basic hacks to the game.
8857236	8861739	But they got more and more and more in depth and now you've got all these level changes.
8861939	8866242	Do you ever remember the Metroid level editor that they made?
8866622	8866942	Oh yeah.
8867403	8875488	And there's actually several now whole new versions of Metroid, classic Metroid, that different layouts and everything that are really well done.
8876431	8877852	Well, thank you for a blast from the past.
8877912	8882374	Maybe it'll be better than that Wii version they did some time ago.
8883034	8883474	There you go.
8883554	8885015	Ramaditya from Indonesia.
8885255	8886776	I'd love being an international show.
8887936	8888897	All right, moving on.
8889577	8889977	Let's see.
8890458	8892979	Here's a cheap plug from Travis H.
8893699	8897181	This is worth mentioning because it has to do with our old favorite pastime.
8897522	8899063	Travis H sent us a plug here.
8899743	8905607	I will attempt the DDR marathon record again on November 23rd at 5 a.m.
8905727	8908449	Eastern to November 24th to 9 p.m.
8908529	8911251	Eastern, but this time on doubles play.
8913052	8920137	He links to an event on Facebook and something called CrowdRise.com slash DDR World Record.
8920637	8922058	So he's doing the record.
8922599	8923219	Is it for charity?
8923239	8923840	That's what I want to know.
8923860	8925321	He's going to do it in Knoxville, Tennessee.
8926502	8927022	Ah, here we go.
8927342	8928163	It is for charity.
8928203	8930725	He raised $1,000 for local charity through the event.
8931045	8933127	He wants to double his results this year.
8933627	8935729	Rescue Ministries Meals.
8936209	8938711	I will be pledging two meals per one hour that I compete.
8939051	8941074	Well, at least it's for a good cause at the end of the day.
8941515	8948524	So, I'm all for everybody trying to one-up each other on these marathons and Guinness Book of World Records and stuff when it's for charity.
8948645	8949346	So, good on you.
8949666	8951929	Speaking of charity, am I not correct?
8951969	8954333	Desert Bus started again this weekend.
8954453	8954673	Yes.
8956260	8957061	Desert Bust is going.
8957161	8958501	Umlaut's coming up, of course.
8958541	8960223	You've heard Jamie talking about that.
8961023	8962444	I'm still working on badges.
8963204	8964986	It's that time of year for child's play.
8966026	8969448	By the way, I want to let you know that I was watching some Guinness World Records stuff.
8969789	8971310	They fit 28 women into a mini.
8972710	8973011	Wow.
8973531	8973751	I know.
8973791	8976373	I'm like, why do people think that this is record worthy?
8977273	8980475	Oh, and the longest note on a didgeridoo was won by a 14-year-old.
8981036	8981396	Just saying.
8982990	8984071	I miss didgeridoos.
8986353	8987734	I miss techno didgeridoo.
8987774	8988274	Remember that?
8988334	8989796	That was a thing on OLR years ago.
8990796	8992918	I wanted to bring up the didgeridoo for that.
8993178	8993479	All right.
8993779	8995981	Quick charity is something that's interesting.
8996001	9004227	Actually, the reason I mentioned that I've been out here in California for over a week, and I wasn't on last week's show because my employer held a dodgeball charity tournament.
9005408	9009672	It was basically a who's who of the startups and Silicon Valley startups
9010052	9013662	mostly San Francisco area competitors and it was a whole hell of a lot of fun.
9014665	9017472	I believe it was $60,000 for local San Francisco charities.
9017633	9017853	It was...
9019626	9022727	You know, Dodgeball, what experience do we have from Dodgeball?
9023588	9026048	The NES version that was amazing and Jim.
9026749	9028869	And this was, there were 20 teams.
9028949	9032170	It was a Neo Geo game too, which was amazing.
9033211	9037532	20 teams across 17 businesses.
9038292	9039373	A whole day's worth of fun.
9039473	9040453	It was amazing.
9040693	9044134	And even the World Dodgeball Society came out to officiate it and everything.
9044514	9045375	It was a great time.
9046275	9052421	Dodgeball was a fun game, that was one of my favorites growing up Absolutely Alright, you ready to get taken back with this inside joke?
9052982	9054944	We're all dancing I want the DDR guy to dance to that
9069978	9072487	If I'm ever a wrestler, that's the music I'm coming out to.
9073310	9075818	Alright, last email tonight from Elliot B.
9077028	9079289	Dear OLR, just a quick email here.
9079709	9086010	I'd like to celebrate the fact that yesterday was the 10th anniversary of Metroid Prime, my personal favorite game ever.
9086150	9086470	Really?
9086791	9087171	10 years?
9088071	9088571	Jesus.
9089131	9092332	I played it again a few weeks ago and it's barely aged a day.
9092712	9096113	The controls are pitch perfect and the graphics still look good.
9096533	9101234	Here's hoping the series gets resurrected sometime soon after Metroid Other M's Kiss of Death.
9104275	9110158	Elliot B. I had no idea that series was 10 years old, but it makes perfect sense.
9110458	9123784	You know, if Virtual Console on Wii U were to start making GameCube games show up, which isn't outside the realm of possibility, Metroid Prime would sure be a prime candidate to kick things off.
9128860	9146060	Elliot's regretting that he sent that email right now Anyhow, that's it for emails this week Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com A few more stories for you guys Can we be having the Metroid primaries?
9149605	9151428	Yeah, he's really regretting sending that email.
9151448	9155554	You know, we're going to have an empty mailbag again next week, and we're going to say, why isn't anybody emailing us?
9155694	9157737	Oh, yeah, because we always tell the stupidest jokes.
9157817	9160080	All right.
9160400	9162704	Now would be an appropriate time to do the FUs of the week.
9179384	9195059	FU's of the week, DarkSakura FU to me not having a cat I really want a cat My husband says that we can't get a cat until we buy a house So you better hurry up and buy me a house so I can get a cat The end
9197608	9201569	F you to the utter lack of self-control that I have and my credit card bill next month.
9228194	9231316	but yay to those reward points.
9231396	9231757	Jason.
9234799	9238482	FU to not having a car because we're down to one and Brian actually has to drive to work.
9239983	9244366	FU to Wells Fargo for reasons that I don't really need to go into but are probably completely obvious.
9244606	9246888	I can guess based on the FU, yeah.
9246948	9250350	And related to that, FU to $2 keyboards and $50 computers.
9250450	9256355	There's, you know, people, places like Wells Fargo that have to buy these cheap-ass little computers because everything just runs on a web browser.
9256795	9257896	I hate those keyboards.
9258036	9270181	I don't know if it's just ingrained to me because I've always worked desk computer keyboard jobs, but holy crap, you have a crappy keyboard and computers become an impossible thing.
9271602	9280026	Oh man, I did not realize that that's ever something they would say to me.
9280066	9285809	There's this bridge near Berkeley, north of the Bay Bridge, an overpass rather, north of the Bay Bridge,
9286549	9292033	And every time I've been out here and come up towards Sacramento, there's a sign up there, Investigate 9-11, Stop the War.
9292333	9294594	I get the sentiment, but you're still up there.
9294815	9295475	It's Berkeley.
9296255	9296916	Just, wow.
9297056	9298557	Berserkly.
9300118	9304141	And related to that, FU to... We love Berkeley, but they bring the crazy.
9304321	9305301	And that's why we love them.
9305341	9307303	We need a little unpredictability in our life.
9307423	9313206	And related to that, FU to the coney burned and carved into the hillside that I saw going up here.
9313687	9315508	How many votes did he end up getting for president?
9318368	9320610	Wow, what?
9321191	9323132	Was he on the Colorado ballot like I was talking about?
9323152	9323933	He might have been.
9323953	9325234	Did I miss something?
9325274	9326715	You haven't heard that joke?
9326775	9330238	I just told the same joke that went around Twitter all day after election.
9330799	9334802	With all the bumper stickers on cars, how many votes did he get in the election?
9334862	9336163	Wow, it's actually pretty good.
9337584	9339286	F you to me for being out of the scene.
9340748	9349897	Lastly, F you to the Wii U for sometimes just not having button shortcuts, so you have to let go of the controller, tap on the gamepad screen, and just...
9352599	9355742	It, I'm sure, will be patched, but it's just, it feels weird sometimes.
9355762	9359024	That's one of those doors that goes into a room where, surprise, it's nothing.
9359064	9361586	I can't wait for the next 5 gigabyte patch that I'll have.
9362267	9369753	Sorry, you owners that have the 8 gigabyte model, you're just not going to be able to have the shortcuts because it's another 5 gigabytes.
9369773	9370153	Good enough.
9371987	9374170	I still don't understand.
9374530	9375091	Me-verse.
9375351	9378094	I can't just make a post to show all my friends.
9378214	9388165	I have to post in the... If I want to show my cat, I've got to go to the Mass Effect 3 community and say, Hey, Mass Effect 3 community, I just want to post a picture of my cat.
9388706	9392010	Do you really want a public Nintendo-operated Twitter clone, though?
9393693	9404105	Well, well, well, well, it offers me something that Twitter doesn't, and that is hand-drawn stylus messages.
9404706	9413336	It sounds to me that this whole Miiverse thing is going to kind of devolve into some sort of GameFAQs forum thing.
9414560	9430435	to be fair it works better than the Vita's thing which I still like I don't like you know the Vita has that whole thing like you can see like what your friends are doing and you can even comment on posts nobody fucking knows it's there you probably don't even know what I'm talking about it's under the achieve
9430435	9432417	Achievements, create a trophy screen.
9432497	9438363	No, when you go into the games, you hit the little thing that says down and it shows you the feed like so-and-so just got this game.
9438704	9440045	So-and-so unlocked a trophy.
9440165	9443769	And you can actually like or whatever the PlayStation version of like is.
9444089	9450196	You can like posts and comment and all that shit like it was Facebook, but ain't nobody reading it.
9451377	9453318	because it's integrated, very shitty.
9453998	9456919	Like I'm going to go into each individual game I own to look at the feed.
9456999	9463722	Like that should be, to Nintendo's credit, at least that's the thing that comes up when I turn my Nintendo on.
9464457	9464917	Thanks for watching!
9485191	9489075	Yeah, Tigerclaw sent me a link saying, are you sure you want this to happen?
9489135	9494421	And then, of course, you know, ta-da, it's a penis drawn on the Wii U. What a shock.
9494941	9495402	A series of them.
9495422	9496923	That looks like multiple penises, actually.
9496943	9497464	That's a lot.
9497504	9498865	That is, they're upside down.
9498905	9499346	You know what?
9499386	9500627	That's the banner of dick.
9500867	9506233	It's just, it's a drawing of an alien planet where mushrooms grow from the ceiling.
9506413	9507033	That's what it is.
9508214	9509675	I still call it the banner of dick.
9510316	9512277	There are cave formations that do look like this.
9512317	9514338	I think it's funny that it's under archery and swordplay.
9521362	9523763	Well played.
9523783	9526225	Does that make the TTP two hours and 45 minutes?
9531227	9533529	This is just one of those shows.
9533629	9534649	Bravo, JD1.
9536941	9539523	TigerClaw suggests maybe it is Turian genitalia.
9540784	9542806	I think that Turian cock looks different than that.
9543246	9547870	Yeah, that would imply that Turians pull down their pants and it's like an octopus down there.
9548350	9551653	From those drawings, that would imply that Turians have foreskins.
9553815	9555857	Moving on and quickly.
9557313	9558754	Loki, what do you have for us?
9559575	9565098	Before we get, we're up almost to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
9565118	9566619	We're almost there, but not just yet.
9566699	9570422	I don't have banners of cocks unless that's a new game franchise that they're going to put out.
9570442	9570982	Well, get out!
9572183	9577306	But Ubisoft is, you know, they may be interested in THQ's assets.
9578227	9582170	Of course, you know, their boss, was it Vess?
9582470	9584571	I'm not even going to try to pronounce it.
9584691	9585132	French guy.
9585552	9585832	Anyways.
9587453	9595765	Anyways, he basically said, yeah, they're always interested in good brands, and it may be something they can consider buying some of the IP from.
9597328	9601554	I think it's just all speculation, the kind of going, reaching out to people, saying, hey, you know...
9603052	9610739	What do you think THQ's assets impact is going to be on the Neo Geo console or the Dreamcast or something like that?
9612641	9614583	But they're just kind of reaching.
9615263	9618286	Obviously, if they struggle enough, then they're going to try to sell off IP.
9618306	9621849	But I think they've already sold off IP or at least stopped making stuff.
9622770	9626854	I know they're still sitting on a bunch of those Udraw tablets, that's for sure.
9626874	9627775	Yeah.
9629412	9630193	But I don't know.
9630293	9636837	I think right now they've kind of limited it down to what they're going to work with and they're going to make some quality games based on it.
9636877	9638739	Or at least they're going to try and fail.
9639659	9641421	But we'll see.
9642341	9644563	I tell you one IP they're not interested in right now.
9645403	9646184	UFC Undisputed.
9647084	9648185	Well, that's not theirs anymore.
9649406	9650287	That would be EA.
9651848	9651948	Oh.
9654740	9656282	Kill that joke.
9656302	9659665	They aren't interested in it because EA bought it already.
9662728	9663449	Alrighty then.
9666385	9694181	I got one more story for you guys and you know I know this I know that this is the reason that you guys tune into Orange Lounge Radio is that you want to have your news on Beyonce and I've got your Beyonce news for you right here and it has to do with that lawsuit that was going on between Beyonce and Gate 5 this was that whole thing about Superstar Beyonce the game that was going to happen and then she backed out of the deal so
9696343	9696903	Here it is now.
9696963	9703369	The appeal of the judgment where Beyonce's lawyers tried to basically get it thrown out.
9703389	9707452	They wanted a summary judgment in April saying the Gate 5 didn't pull in the financing.
9707753	9708934	That appeal failed.
9709194	9715079	This doesn't mean Beyonce has lost, but this means we're going to get the trial of the century.
9715219	9719263	It's going to go to trial, and a jury will determine if they don't settle first.
9719503	9723006	Yeah, it's just like, trial of the century, call of duty, and settle.
9723346	9729429	or a jury will have to determine if Beyonce was within her contract to leave the project or if she broke the agreement.
9729829	9731950	So we could get a trial out of this.
9731990	9732851	That would be kind of fun.
9732971	9733791	Probably won't, though.
9733811	9734532	Yeah, it'll settle.
9734672	9735332	You know it'll settle.
9738544	9740846	But all I gotta say is, man, two keytars?
9741106	9741947	That's just fancy.
9741987	9742828	I know, that's awesome.
9742928	9750274	Here's the thing, is that we're looking at this little picture of Beyonce doing her little sachet, and her one keyboard girl's really into it over here, but look at this one.
9750934	9753216	This one that looks like Juliette Lewis with blonde hair.
9753336	9756839	She looks like the chick from Mean Girls or whatever.
9757419	9759441	No, not Mean Girls, I'm sorry.
9759481	9762243	She looks like the chick from Glee, the one that always has the blank...
9762483	9763603	Oh, Brittany!
9763643	9764924	Why do I know that?
9765184	9766104	Oh, God!
9766224	9766604	You know what?
9766664	9769205	I can safely say I've never seen an episode of that show.
9769225	9770065	I am so gay.
9771306	9772226	And I can say that.
9772826	9773186	Hey, no.
9773566	9779868	I watched part of the series, at least the first few seasons, just because it was by the guy that did Nip Tuck, although that series was weird.
9780709	9784110	But yeah, I got out of it after about, I think, a couple seasons.
9784170	9785750	I've seen one episode of Nip Tuck.
9785790	9788091	That's where they put all the liposuction fat in the woman's car.
9789639	9790340	That's the only episode I've seen.
9790360	9791400	That could be any episode, really.
9791440	9792922	American Horror Story is much better.
9793542	9794022	It's messed up.
9794062	9794643	Is that also him?
9794983	9795624	Yeah, it's also him.
9796004	9796364	Much better.
9796384	9803089	Like, if you like the FX show, you'll like American Horror Story, which is also an FX show, just so you know.
9803890	9804190	All right.
9805091	9806011	They're on season two, even.
9807512	9815458	Uh, yes, so, after all that Beyonce and Glee news, we can finally go back to video games And your phone calls!
9815658	9832169	Skype line's open right now, 1-877-1-877-GAME-OLR Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, all one word I'll get to the Twitter topics here in just a moment, but I thought I'd check in with Loki first to see if there's any last minute stories
9832506	9833246	Yeah, this is kind of weird.
9833307	9840871	I guess Nintendo, for your Nintendo ID, if you're a minor, requires a credit card verification that's going to cost you 50 cents.
9841031	9845314	Which leads to the question, why don't you just say you're an adult if you're a minor?
9846375	9848376	Save the fee and the hassle.
9848936	9851498	Which I'm sure most people will probably do.
9852739	9855081	I wonder if that's a permanent thing, because stuff like that is usually refunded.
9855121	9858464	Because Loki, Reggie doesn't like liars.
9858965	9866692	Oh yeah, I'm sure that all those kids too are very truthful when it comes to those age-gated videos as well.
9866912	9873699	I'm sure no one says that they were born in the current date, 1900 or something like that.
9874079	9877022	When you go to Xtube.com, sure I was January 1st, 1900.
9878203	9878803	Yeah, exactly.
9878943	9880504	Hey, we got a call on the line.
9881104	9882704	Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
9883684	9884805	Ranma's back again.
9884865	9885465	You again.
9885545	9886125	Gotta go.
9886225	9886865	Have a nice day.
9886925	9887325	No, I'm kidding.
9887365	9887906	Hey!
9888006	9888866	What's up, buddy?
9889966	9890586	Not much.
9891887	9900029	You did bring Reggie to OLR and ask him a really dumb question, and I mean that in like a showgirls is dumb but I love it kind of way.
9902810	9903830	So, what's up, buddy?
9905103	9932399	something interesting that happened with GameStop and now with their current set of pre-orders it seems that my brother he went to pre-order his Wii paid off in full he was going to have issues picking it up because of work and the store that's open and the whole 48 hours thing he was pretty much was told more or less that if he doesn't pick it up in 48 hours they're going to give it to somebody else
9934816	9946504	Now, it seems that due to an issue with the release of Assassin's Creed, it doesn't matter if you pre-order your game or console paid in full or not.
9947125	9949166	If somebody wants it, they can have it.
9951089	9951870	No, but the thing is that...
9970523	9973867	GameStop has now what's called no person left behind.
9974367	9981273	So that guarantees, even if you pre-order it, paid for it in full, if it's the last copy, you're coming to pick it up.
9981714	9989541	If someone beats you by 10 minutes, even though that's your copy, that other person can walk out the store with it and you'll have to wait until the next shipment.
9990001	9993044	And depending on the game, don't know when it's coming.
9993144	9994846	Then why are you pre-ordering?
9996853	9998634	That's my point, exactly.
9999254	10002535	Well, yeah, I mean, I've never been a big fan of the pre-order system at all.
10002595	10006777	I can't think of the last thing I pre-ordered, and that's how I voice my opinion.
10006897	10007777	I don't participate.
10008177	10017200	You didn't pre-order a Wii U. I did not pre-order a Wii U. I'm not sitting here going nanny nanny poo poo, I found one anyway, but I did find one anyway.
10018461	10021081	You know, like, it could happen.
10021462	10022642	Now, you probably couldn't do it now.
10022742	10024783	Now that the day is over, I don't think you're going to find one, but...
10026284	10029487	They're supposedly putting them out more frequently.
10029827	10031649	But, okay, I gotta go back to this.
10031829	10034552	So why couldn't your friend get there within 48 hours?
10036728	10037248	My bro.
10037468	10038329	Sorry, your brother.
10039130	10040070	It's work schedule.
10040591	10045214	The GameStop, he was able to pick it up, but today they were open from 11 to 6.
10046015	10049618	He works 11 to 7, and he's a 45-minute drive away.
10051019	10051560	Oh, okay.
10051800	10055803	Alright, that makes sense, and especially with all the shenanigans that have happened out there back east.
10056343	10058525	I mean, I'm sure they're still cleaning up some of the roads.
10061367	10062388	Don't get me started about that.
10062448	10064450	Are they still rationing the gas and all that shit?
10065579	10068701	Um, and New York City, I think they still are.
10068901	10069421	Wow.
10069722	10071002	I'll have to double check with that.
10071162	10071543	Wow.
10072163	10079827	Anyway, sorry, didn't mean to change the topic on you, but I do feel like this isn't the first I've heard of this policy.
10080048	10088673	I do want to say GameStop has kind of done this before, where it's like, well, if you don't show up to get your stuff, we are going to give it to a customer who's willing to, you know, show up and pay for it.
10088973	10090053	I'm not saying it makes it right.
10090454	10092695	I'm just saying I don't think this is necessarily...
10093235	10102846	News, but when we're talking about a $350 console that it's happening with, it does sting a hell of a lot more than some $40 game.
10103727	10104327	Exactly.
10104367	10105789	Stop shopping at GameStop!
10105889	10107271	I'm sorry, it had to be said.
10107911	10109293	Loki, you are absolutely correct.
10109313	10110794	This is why I shop at Best Buy.
10110814	10112997	They give you at least two weeks to pick up your stuff.
10114153	10118777	Or shit, Walmart had that whole layaway thing where you'd have to tell Christmas Day to come get it.
10118877	10122199	So, you know, you got to look at the other options.
10122840	10123420	Exactly.
10123620	10125221	Or Target's where I looked out today.
10125682	10127403	Did I talk about that during the show?
10127503	10131126	I use the Target app on iPhone to see because you can check inventories.
10131626	10136550	And I saw that there was one, not my closest Target, but the second closest one had them in stock.
10138407	10143351	Now, I was discussing, more or less discussing, arguing with another person that works at GameStop.
10143752	10153721	I said, look, if I paid for my Wii U in full, and when I get there, it's not there, that's theft.
10154562	10160526	Me personally, at that point, I will want a full refund of what I paid, and I'm going somewhere else to pick up my console.
10160926	10164308	Now, this other person is arguing, it's not theft because you're still going to get it.
10164368	10171432	I'm like, yes it is, since you pretty much guaranteed me one, that last one belongs to me, and not nobody else.
10173624	10178065	I think that's rough.
10178245	10181706	I can't make a fairness claim because it's not fair to anyone.
10182626	10189368	It's nice that they will be willing to give it up eventually, that they give you a window.
10189868	10191929	Okay, so I'm talking primarily Wii U right now.
10191969	10195610	You said 48 hours, but it doesn't really cover what you were talking about.
10195690	10196430	Assassin's Creed 3, it's...
10197270	10197951	No, no, no.
10197991	10205938	What I mean to say was because of what happened with Assassin's Creed 3, people who pre-ordered didn't get it because it went to other people.
10206198	10209241	So an email came from corporate from that no person left behind.
10209481	10212064	Does it matter about the 40-hour rule is...
10213425	10216830	No longer in effect, even though there's still some stores that are still doing it.
10231008	10232290	Yeah, that's exactly what it is.
10232450	10234932	I get that from a business perspective.
10235573	10237495	I totally get that from a business perspective.
10237535	10241739	But here's the question that a lot of companies don't always assess properly.
10242320	10249407	At what customer service sacrifice are you going to imply that business perspective?
10249447	10250709	It's about finding balance.
10251556	10254137	and GameStop's opinion, obviously at the price of $50, $60.
10255377	10257938	GameStop can lose a few customers and still make a profit.
10257978	10260018	At the same time, though, they did just close 20 stores.
10260398	10264679	So maybe they're not in the best position to be turning people away, but I don't know.
10265620	10270541	At the same time, they pissed your brother off, potentially, but they would have made someone else very happy.
10271181	10271501	True.
10271842	10273863	So again, I'm not saying it's right.
10273963	10277966	I'm just trying to weigh the different sides of it and look at the business perspective.
10278326	10278586	All right.
10279327	10282669	And you're right because I worked retail for like 15 plus years.
10282970	10284691	I mean I see the business side of it.
10284851	10287253	I also see the customer side of things.
10287513	10292857	If it was me personally, if I knew the person and it was like – I would do my best to hold it for them.
10292997	10295659	But my manager is telling me give it to the next person.
10295999	10296540	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
10314079	10316860	Hey, I want to come get my system, but I can't.
10317120	10320742	Can I have an extension until such and such reasonable time?
10321022	10323923	Reasonable being within another 48 hours or whatever.
10324284	10326524	Then grant them the stinking extension.
10326825	10329806	But if a person no call no shows, then give their shit away.
10330486	10332167	I think that's a fair compromise.
10332927	10333207	It is.
10333448	10333768	It is.
10334728	10341157	But as you can see, GameStop's all about making that, I mean, ShameStop's all about making that green dollar buck.
10341478	10344842	Yeah, well, and I don't know what, I'm just some schmo with a podcast.
10344922	10345984	I don't know what I'm talking about.
10346653	10347834	I know, right?
10349335	10352217	Alright, well, we gotta let you go, buddy, but any quick final thoughts for us?
10353177	10354578	No, but stay fabulous.
10354878	10357360	I will, and stay black, and thank you for all your hard work this week.
10357880	10358961	Hey, no problem, that's what we're here for.
10359081	10361562	And pass along thank you to Taiki as well, of course.
10362083	10362443	Will do.
10362583	10363103	Alright, bye-bye.
10364084	10366085	And be sure to prepare yourself for the physical cliff.
10368968	10369949	1-877-GAME-OLR.
10370830	10373753	Ain't no one getting a Wii U if that thing doesn't get resolved, right?
10374233	10374613	All right.
10374633	10378698	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10378818	10379538	All one word.
10380620	10382542	Any other last minute stories or should I get some tweets?
10384564	10385805	Just kind of some random stuff.
10385845	10388167	Tom Hardy's going to be in the Splinter Cell movie.
10388187	10388808	She mentioned that.
10389790	10390671	Oh, I wasn't listening.
10391252	10393214	I just thought I'd mention it again because Tom Hardy's awesome.
10393575	10396058	Although I have yet to see the last Batman movie.
10397139	10397580	Me too.
10397620	10398161	I really need to.
10398481	10400483	Or Avengers.
10400644	10402005	I think I said this on the show already.
10402085	10407092	The last Batman movie was great, but Tom Hardy's Bane, it really creeped me out how he sounded like Count Von Count.
10408092	10410734	I'm going to destroy Gotham City!
10410754	10413076	He sounded Belgian to me.
10413856	10417899	I don't know if you've seen that YouTube video series now.
10417939	10421121	They have Tom Hardy reading the cans of Monster Energy drink.
10422061	10423302	No, I haven't seen that.
10423682	10451347	you need to find that it's hilarious Tom Hardy is hot as hell well it's not Tom Hardy it's Bane it's Tom Hardy's Bane reading the one fish two fish alright we got another call coming in let's go to the phones hi you are on Orange Launch Radio who's this it's Amiga 777 I'm sorry say that again you are a little bit quiet Amiga 777 Amiga 777 now I can hear you buddy what's on your mind
10453444	10456966	Basically, the Wii U launch.
10457846	10458306	Yes.
10460707	10467290	Last night I was out, you know, just driving around seeing if there was anyone, you know, who might have been camping.
10468270	10473253	You know, out in anticipation or pre-orders, anything like that.
10475214	10477515	I couldn't find really anybody.
10477595	10478375	It's like if they...
10487428	10492329	You know, I think a lot more stores did pre-orders this time, which was very different from last time.
10493090	10506674	In 2006, I remember because we drove around and looked at all the lines, and we participated in a line at Target, and there was a line at Walmart, there was a line at Best Buy, there was a line at Toys R Us, there was a line at Circuit City.
10507074	10508815	Well, we all know why there wasn't a line there this year.
10509295	10512038	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10531716	10533877	But I sure did see some interesting tweets.
10534377	10536978	And again, it's Twitter, so take it with a grain of salt.
10537278	10546882	But I saw somebody on Twitter who said there was a line at Walmart and the third person in line bought all the remaining Wii U's and pissed everybody else off in line.
10547222	10548963	Because you know she was going to flip them on eBay.
10549543	10550624	And actually...
10551184	10558948	The clerk I had at Target today said somebody tried to come in and do the same thing, and they said no, because they had a policy on these items to sell only one.
10559248	10561949	And I said, good, because you know those are just going to end up on eBay.
10561989	10566731	And he's like, yeah, they need to do something about those eBay flippers.
10566771	10567752	I'm like, hell yeah they do.
10568552	10571333	Anyway, sorry, I got a little tangenty.
10571393	10572454	So you didn't find any lines?
10574635	10578857	Yeah, I mean, I was looking for campers late at night, just waiting.
10578877	10579417	It's like,
10580273	10581717	I was like, where is everybody?
10582018	10583341	They all went to New York City.
10583582	10585266	I thought this was a big deal.
10587031	10587171	And...
10588812	10592474	I'm getting a text message correcting me from somebody listening right now.
10593194	10594995	They did do pre-orders at Target.
10595996	10598557	Okay, well, shit, they didn't do enough then.
10598757	10599517	I didn't realize they did.
10599698	10601438	Apparently not to sell out their first-run stock.
10601498	10602619	Yeah, that's weird.
10602659	10605941	They must have done them real late in the game because I didn't see anything on the website or nothing.
10606001	10609503	But all right, I'll take his word for it.
10609923	10611804	Maybe they didn't all do it, too.
10611824	10612644	It could have been certain ones.
10612724	10613104	But anyway...
10614745	10617346	Maybe the time to have seen the line would have been earlier today.
10617606	10617966	I don't know.
10618426	10623867	But yeah, it's kind of a bummer the line thing didn't happen because there was a lot of community that came with it.
10624088	10625528	Jamie, I know you had a real fun time.
10625968	10631770	Well, I don't know about real fun, but you had a well enough time in the line just kind of talking to people, right?
10631890	10633290	Yeah, but it did get kind of boring.
10633860	10634220	Oh, yeah.
10634861	10636041	And then I got really sleepy.
10636081	10638062	At four in the morning, it starts to get old.
10638362	10640563	Oh, and then there was the woman who showed up like after all of us.
10640723	10642424	Everyone who waited got a Wii.
10643184	10645525	The one woman who just showed up at five in the morning?
10645985	10646185	No.
10647266	10647406	Aw.
10647706	10649027	Five in the morning is still really early.
10649627	10652048	I walked in there at 1030 and got a Wii U today.
10652348	10652528	All right.
10653209	10654569	Amiga, enough about us.
10654949	10655630	How about you?
10655790	10657410	You went around and looked at all these lines.
10657991	10660832	Is the Wii U something you were interested in picking up or no?
10662779	10672107	Kind of, sort of, you know, just really curious, you know, just, you know, it's a new system from Nintendo and I'm just hearing a lot about it.
10674088	10691722	Currently, you know, don't quite have the funds to get one of my own at this time, but, you know, I was taken with all the hype behind it, you know, and Reggie sees amazing on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon a couple nights ago.
10691963	10692223	Mm-hmm.
10694305	10699831	I thought I was going to be seeing a lot of avid fans of Nintendo.
10701553	10710943	I guess instead, I saw it as Nintendo probably just planning a light launch or something like that.
10711343	10715688	And I think me and maybe others might have anticipated it.
10716525	10746177	maybe it's something that will really start to gear up through 2013 oh yeah you do talk about the light launch and we didn't see a lot of commercials this year either I mean there was like the occasional movie screen commercial that I caught but like there's not really been the TV commercials or that whole like what they did last time with the we would like to play I think and I heard this theory on Bobby's show and it seems perfectly reasonable to me they're just saving all that money to market them next year after Christmas makes sense to me
10747373	10749794	or after Thanksgiving, the bigger holiday rush.
10750094	10750534	Either or.
10750954	10753995	But just why blow all the money now when all your pre-orders sold out?
10754655	10755715	Who do you have to advertise to?
10756095	10757356	Let the word of mouth do its thing.
10759536	10760557	Very true.
10760757	10761137	Very true.
10761377	10764598	Alright, Amiga77, I hope you're able to get one if you want one.
10764998	10767478	Hopefully, maybe your luck will turn around around the holidays.
10767899	10769379	But thanks so much for calling the show, alright?
10770754	10772435	Alright, take care, buddy.
10772615	10772775	Yep.
10773616	10773936	Bye-bye.
10776117	10776798	Thanks for the call.
10776938	10778299	I haven't heard from him in a long time.
10778579	10781961	Appreciate hearing from some callers we don't hear from all the time.
10782781	10785503	TigerClaw in chat says, I haven't seen any Wii U commercials.
10785563	10788385	I only see a lot of commercials for that Red Dawn remake.
10789165	10792670	which apparently, according to the commercial, always got a lot of good reviews.
10793091	10794393	Okay, here's the thing.
10794854	10801704	There are so many movie critics that'll say good things about any fucking movie just to be in the commercial and gain their own cred.
10802024	10802505	Believe it.
10804002	10807124	For the record, I'm sorry, Red Dawn was a movie in the 80s.
10807144	10807384	It was.
10807964	10808444	That's all.
10808644	10810165	That's the only thing I have to say about that.
10810245	10812787	And they're remaking it because you know it's so topical.
10812807	10816569	I kind of want to see the sequel or the second one or the remake or whatever you want to call it.
10816749	10817749	I kind of want to see it.
10817809	10818129	Really?
10818169	10819150	Because it looks kind of cool.
10819610	10819930	Really?
10820551	10824593	I just want the scene where the girl's dead and she has the grenade on her and they find her and they blow up.
10825173	10828795	I'm not like, you know, I don't think it's going to be better than the original or anything like that.
10828815	10830356	It's just going to be, it's just a movie.
10830496	10830896	Whatever.
10831256	10832537	It's just a dumb popcorn flick.
10833095	10833595	Exactly.
10833795	10835136	It is a dumb popcorn flick.
10836116	10841859	And there's been a lot of dumb popcorn flicks that have come out, like Dread, that ended up being really good.
10842579	10844881	Dread was amazingly good.
10845141	10845781	Oh, man.
10846161	10848322	It's funny to say, that's the last movie that I saw.
10848462	10849543	I've missed Avengers.
10849703	10851244	I've missed Prometheus.
10851644	10853104	I haven't seen Wreck-It Ralph yet.
10853144	10853925	I want to see Skyfall.
10853965	10854985	I want to see all of those.
10855465	10857106	For some reason, I just don't see movies enough.
10857586	10860328	But when I was out in New Mexico, I saw Dread with some friends of mine.
10860488	10860648	Oh, man.
10860888	10865232	Man, knew nothing about it going in other than Judge Dredd and completely worth it.
10865252	10866334	I used to have the pinball table.
10866354	10868836	I don't know if I played that one.
10869136	10869457	All right.
10869477	10869997	It's okay.
10870117	10872700	If anybody else wants to call, I can squeeze in one other quick call.
10872720	10875923	1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
10876464	10877385	Any other last minute stories?
10877425	10878946	I still have some Twitter topics to do, but...
10879947	10895655	Yeah, as we kind of mentioned a little bit, your Nintendo Network account is tied to your Wii U, so if it breaks, I guess you better send it to Nintendo, because I'm sure they can transfer it to a new system, but if you try to go buy a new system, you're fucked.
10896275	10897196	So, just saying.
10898436	10901818	I'm giving Nintendo the benefit of the doubt here that they just haven't implemented that yet.
10902179	10902519	I hope.
10902699	10903059	I hope.
10903199	10913285	I'm thinking that it's something that a consumer can't just go buy a new system that they have to send it in Nintendo for a repair and then they can do the transfer because that's how it was with the Wii.
10913465	10918768	How do you get all your Wii or Wii virtual console crap transferred over that they would have to do it.
10919268	10942522	and then of course somebody accidentally found a way to get into the dev stuff or the debug menu for the Wii U thing and then there was another one that someone put that somehow they got into the debug thing for the Wii U Miiverse but I think that's photoshopped so I'm not going to say anything about that but yeah the debug menu though on the actual system I can believe that
10943817	10944137	TigerClaw.com
10963257	10971603	The Human Rights Campaign, which champions a lot of LGBT causes, which, you know, obviously huge, huge month for them with the elections.
10972563	10978407	Microsoft and EA were recognized as best places to work for LGBT equality.
10978849	10987439	And I love that the picture on this article is Kaiden and Man Shepard from Mass Effect 3, which is a great example from EA's universe.
10989481	10991704	I'm telling you, I don't care how it makes me sound.
10992124	10994127	That's the reason I played Mass Effect.
10994187	10996009	I was like, alright, I do need to play Mass Effect.
10996049	10997550	I gotta see what this is all about.
10998472	10999413	I was not disappointed.
10999873	11001195	But there's something in it for everybody.
11003577	11005800	And I know Microsoft has always got kudos to this.
11006080	11009864	I saw there was like an official Microsoft gamer con video that they did.
11009924	11012787	And I know they've always been pretty good too with this stuff.
11013208	11013828	So good for them.
11014849	11019555	The 2013 Corporate Equality Index is the national benchmarking tool on corporate policies.
11019895	11021597	This is according to the official website.
11022237	11026479	and EA's Chief Talent Officer, Gabrielle Toledano.
11026919	11035083	I am very pleased that EA has scored 100% rating and has been recognized by the Human Rights Campaign in a year where the company has taken significant steps to remain inclusive.
11035543	11042706	EA has made changes to our medical benefits, been involved in LGBT events in our community and taken a public stance against the Defense of Marriage Act.
11043166	11047728	EA champions diversity with a work environment where everyone feels welcome and can be themselves.
11048288	11058070	You know, I sometimes forget that like I have Alan on my medical insurance because, you know, we've been together long enough that it's basically whether we're legally recognized or not.
11058110	11059851	It's like a common law partnership at this thing.
11060231	11061311	I can put him on my benefits.
11061371	11061891	No problem.
11061911	11065552	Because, you know, I'm in California and I work for a health insurance company that recognize that stuff.
11065952	11068392	I sometimes forget like not everybody's that lucky.
11069153	11070693	He just blows my mind.
11072635	11085835	I had one more last minute story please it's kind of cool it's a Black Ops 2 easter egg in the Nuketown 2025 map if you shoot off all the mannequins heads on that map in under 60 seconds it unlocks an Atari 2600
11087937	11101310	on the TV in the game, the Nuketown TV, the big old screen TV, and you can play Activision games, including Hero, Pitfall, and Kaboom were some of the ones I did see screenshots for.
11101530	11101810	Nice.
11102871	11103532	Or video on.
11104482	11119629	a couple questions and comments on Twitter from Osfer on Twitter not sold on the Wii U wait until some relevant games come out I think you're in camp Loki over there I think Loki will be swayed if the right games come out but we ain't there yet Bayonetta 2
11121635	11122776	Ways off still.
11122956	11129181	But I bet there's going to be that Zelda or that big game is going to be a must-have next year.
11129281	11129681	We'll see.
11130061	11130421	We'll see.
11131943	11132743	I'm not disappointed.
11134064	11135745	Spazinator PSN tweets us.
11136686	11137386	Random question.
11137807	11141669	If you three could only pick one to play, which would you pick?
11142330	11145412	I'm going to say you four because he didn't know maybe that Jason was going to be here tonight.
11145732	11146553	Which would you pick?
11146933	11149735	PC gaming or console games?
11150215	11150675	and why?
11151375	11154156	So you only get one or the other ever again.
11154476	11156376	PC gaming or console and why?
11156616	11156996	PC.
11157576	11157756	Why?
11157816	11160077	Practically everything that I want to play on the console is on the PC.
11161257	11164958	I can hook up a controller to the PC and play it as it was a console game.
11165318	11169878	Plus I've got a whole bunch of other games that were made specifically for PC so it really expands my repertoire.
11170278	11179260	Plus I have emulators for classic games so technically I could also play console games on my PC with the right emulator.
11180529	11181469	DC Universe Jason
11208396	11217329	Console gaming, because if there were a computer, I have completely admittedly the library of games I want to play would not be on the platform.
11218411	11222116	Because I'm sure people who care will understand that.
11222800	11240880	Um, I'm gonna go with PC as well, and I think, uh, for most of the same reasons as Jamie, I, it's not, it's not that I necessarily prefer PC over console, I mean, they, they have their perks, but there are some games on PC that just are never gonna happen on the console, like Civ, Civ V.
11241821	11265790	Not gonna happen Typing of the Dead World of Warcraft Hello, that's like the game I play more than anything That's, you know, PC only And I was gonna say the bit about emulators But she took the words out of my mouth Is that most of the classics you can still get on PC Whether, you know, Spazinator would consider that cheating or not I guess it's to be seen But I would say PC gaming So
11266488	11267908	Alright, that's it for Twitter.
11268108	11271369	How about anything else with last minute stories, Loki?
11272929	11274690	Uh, no, got nothing.
11275430	11276810	Oh, we got one more call coming in.
11276850	11280831	I was just about to click the button to close it, but we have one more call coming in and sure we'll take it.
11281151	11282151	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
11282171	11282511	Who's this?
11283291	11284471	Wolverines!
11285372	11285992	What?
11286432	11287092	It's Sterlok.
11287272	11288712	Hey, Sterlok, what's on your mind, buddy?
11291073	11292573	Um, yeah, not too much.
11293073	11293173	Um,
11295430	11299172	I've been checking out Wii U stuff all day.
11299232	11302554	It seems pretty cool.
11304755	11305035	I don't know.
11305155	11315261	I'm liking the whole tablet thing and not needing the TV on if you don't even want to feel like doing that.
11316584	11316624	Um...
11343530	11347493	Well, first of all, good games that I care about.
11347573	11350755	And really, as it stands right now, I don't think there's a whole lot.
11352196	11357240	Just like how the Vita kind of was.
11357961	11364265	It didn't really have much starting, and it's slowly getting more and more games that I care about.
11366627	11371771	What I like is, I guess the tablet actually does have a headphone jack in it.
11373109	11382947	so that's kind of cool obviously my big thing is being able to use the freaking buttons
11385186	11385786	for the menus.
11385926	11388567	I honestly haven't explored that to see if that's a possibility.
11389767	11392608	I've heard that, yeah, you can for at least most things.
11393648	11394228	So that's good.
11395369	11407692	I don't know if you caught my comment earlier in the show, but one of the things I really love about the Wii U is the whole fact that the sound on the TV and the sound coming out of the gamepad will really complement each other.
11408052	11411793	And I'm not just talking about the incidentals like we were used to hearing with the Wii.
11412193	11413194	I heard with Zombie U, your radio...
11431225	11438853	Transmissions, like the stuff that you're getting through, you know, your radio actually comes out of the tablet, which is pretty neat.
11439313	11441915	Yes, and Batman Arkham City does something similar.
11442056	11444958	If you are close to the person, you'll hear it from the TV.
11445078	11448021	If you're far away, you'll hear it on the tablet as a radio transmission.
11448041	11449022	Oh, that is cool.
11449162	11449803	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
11450103	11450844	That's very cool.
11451465	11453446	Now, what I'm curious about is I wonder, like,
11455243	11472499	If all of the game audio, like say if you have your TV doing something else and you're just using the controller, I wonder if all of your game audio is going to be streamed as well or if it's just going to be the...
11473357	11475038	Incidentals, that's what I'm curious about.
11475218	11476279	I think it depends on the game.
11476519	11487447	Yeah, I would have to say, if I would have to take an educated guess, Rob was playing Mario, and the gamepad experience versus the TV was identical.
11488207	11492571	I would assume that when headphones are in there, I didn't really hear anything coming out of the gamepad.
11492591	11495793	The music was not identical, because they were complementing each other.
11495953	11501737	But most of the sound effects, you probably couldn't hear it all the way back here, because you're just hearing all the sound from the side of the room.
11501897	11502378	Thanks for watching!
11524421	11532543	Also, I wanted to bring up a word of caution for those that are big fans of Super Smash Bros.
11532623	11536724	Brawl, particularly with the GameCube controls.
11539225	11543346	Don't get rid of your Wii, because Wii U doesn't have GameCube ports.
11543466	11544726	Oh, that's a very good point.
11545626	11551408	And general consensus from many, many people that I've seen is
11553086	11555468	GameCube controller is kind of the best way to play Brawl.
11555728	11557789	What about the Pro controller?
11557809	11559350	Oh, I guess maybe it wouldn't work.
11559650	11560871	That wouldn't work with Brawl, though.
11561732	11562092	Yikes.
11563013	11563333	Yeah.
11564254	11566715	They need to bring back the Wave Bird.
11567736	11568216	No shit.
11568236	11571138	The only thing the Wave Bird was missing was Rumble.
11571899	11573920	That would have made it perfect.
11574120	11574580	That's true.
11575181	11579584	But that is probably one of my favorite controllers still.
11580327	11608046	it was a good controller just nice and sturdy and just I have my collection of wave birds I do actually have four wave birds one of them is an E3 wave bird that my friend sold me alright well Sterlok I gotta let you go so we can wrap up but any other comments before we let you go um it has nothing to do with games but um swear to god
11610259	11618443	I don't know if it's still there, but there was a single box of Twinkies on eBay with a buy it now of $10,000.
11620144	11620924	I'm not kidding.
11621504	11622445	Fucking ridiculous.
11623245	11623686	I know, right?
11624206	11626667	And I hope they're gold-plated Twinkies.
11626687	11629769	You know all that shit's going to be bought out and don't...
11630858	11631939	Bimbo will do it.
11632259	11632960	We'll be fine.
11633000	11634902	Twinkies aren't even that good anyway.
11634982	11635722	I am telling you.
11636023	11637164	Shit, my thing is Ding Dongs.
11637304	11639986	Little Debbie Strawberry Shortcakes are the bomb.
11640046	11640586	Nutty Bars.
11641007	11645551	But remember, we have two Weird Al references with Hostess products.
11645611	11645991	What's that?
11646131	11648233	Ding Dong Man, Ding Dong, Ding Dong Yo.
11649134	11653037	And the Twinkie Wiener Sandwich.
11654093	11654473	Yes.
11655013	11658694	The only Twinkie that I accept is a deep-fried Twinkie.
11659034	11662835	I only could eat half of one when we did those at the tourney.
11663055	11674257	I don't know, that just sounds like... A part of DDR's history in Sacramento has died because we had the only DDR tournament ever to sell deep-fried Twinkies.
11675477	11675857	Why?
11676697	11677797	Why the fuck not, bitch?
11677817	11680398	What a distinguishing factor you have there.
11682079	11684822	Dude, in Sacramento, we did it fucked up.
11684982	11690828	Because our first tournament was SCAT, Sacramento Cosplay and Tournament.
11693431	11693691	Yes.
11694071	11695853	And it was great.
11695873	11697034	There was an NES game called SCAT.
11701859	11702460	Yes, there was.
11702540	11703640	That was a damn good game.
11703940	11704301	All right.
11704661	11711885	Well, I got to give this call the shaft, as in Sacramento hosts another fabulous tournament, and say goodnight.
11712005	11712945	So take care, Sterlok.
11713265	11713586	See ya.
11713786	11714086	See ya.
11715026	11718148	We had the best acronyms for our... I mean, like, nobody could top that in the DDR.
11718168	11719189	Yeah, we were awesome.
11719229	11719789	We were awesome.
11720638	11723219	Even though everybody in the Bay Area hated Sacramento.
11723979	11726579	Nah, that was mostly one or two dickhead loudmouths.
11726919	11727680	Alright, anyhow.
11729220	11730680	Let's not dig up 10-year-old drama.
11730720	11731680	Burn them bridges.
11732381	11733901	But we're here and they're somewhere else.
11734261	11734881	Alright, anyhow.
11735901	11737662	Let's close up shop for the night.
11737982	11739182	We're done with last-minute stories.
11739202	11740002	We're done with Twitters.
11740322	11741103	We're done with calls.

11777660	11778681	Oh, that's a good question.
11779422	11780503	It's actually kind of a hard question.
11780723	11782564	Besides social networks, I don't really care.
11782584	11783845	Twitter.com is the old standard.
11785046	11787568	Follow your life in 140 characters.
11787589	11788249	140 characters at a time.
11788269	11788810	Twitter.com.
11788930	11790451	There you go.

11804042	11804503	How about Jamie?
11804623	11805844	Jamie, your final thought tonight.
11807923	11827240	Boycott Black Friday My final thought is sounds good to me because I'm going to sleep in Cyber Monday Boycott Black Friday If you're going to get your consumerism on do it on Cyber Monday Buy all your stuff online Hand make a gift Make your cards Hire me to design your cards
11828181	11831983	but do something that isn't going to give in to the whole corporate bullshit.
11832223	11832783	I'm sick of it.
11832843	11838145	Let's just show them that people aren't going to live by being... Oh, I forgot Rob.
11838326	11838646	Sorry.
11840246	11841667	By being consumer whores.
11842747	11847630	My final thought is Jamie's going to be moving to Berkeley pretty soon so she can go be with her people.
11849590	11851992	Shut up.
11852172	11855213	Also, there's no excuse to belt a child ever.
11856121	11858321	My final thought is reject false icons.
11859922	11861522	Loki, your final thought tonight.
11862842	11864083	Try to play more Minecraft, I guess.
11865363	11866363	Go play on the VOG server.
11867263	11872644	I know it's ironic I'm saying that, but I'm telling the audience, not you, I know you're going to play on the VOG server, but just got upgraded, right?
11873685	11875525	Yeah, it's 1.44 now.
11876105	11884007	And it looks like they're getting ready for 1.45, which is yet another bug fix, but I'm not updating that yet because it's not out yet, so I don't need to.
11885390	11886211	Alright, we're done.
11886331	11886851	We're out of here.
11887032	11887912	Thank you guys so much.
