Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:20.000
Tonight, November 25th, 2012, could a new scaled down Xbox 360 be on the way?

00:20.000 --> 00:27.000
Sony's credit rating is reduced, and Japan bans the sale of a controversial cartridge.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.000
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.000 --> 00:37.000
Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:45.000
It is Orange Lounge Radio, live with this episode number 483 for November 25th, 2012.

00:45.000 --> 00:53.000
My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here to talk to you guys about video games and what's going on in gaming culture and so forth with my co-host.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
Say hello, first off, to the one, the only, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
You should really watch where that glass is.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
Oh, with the mic cords and everything?

01:01.000 --> 01:07.000
I didn't want to knock it off and then onto your knee and have you curse loudly, although that might have been funny, but it would have been very poor radio.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.000
Yes, broken glass going into my foot, not a good radio time.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
No, but it would have been hilarious here.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Not really. Heart, heart, heart, heart.

01:15.000 --> 01:19.000
Also say hello, what is it, less than slash three.

01:19.000 --> 01:23.000
Also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
Hi.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
How are you, Loki?

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
Good.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
Alright, what's new with you?

01:27.000 --> 01:28.000
Not much.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Did you have a good holiday?

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Yeah, it was fun.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
Eat a lot?

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
Yes.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Good, good times.

01:33.000 --> 01:37.000
I read about the adventures of your child sitting under the tree eating spaghetti.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
A spaghetti Thanksgiving?

01:39.000 --> 01:40.000
Nellie posted something.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
How does that work?

01:41.000 --> 01:42.000
Eating spaghetti under the tree.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Or eating some food under the tree.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Maybe turkey?

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
Maybe turkey?

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Alright.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
Anyhow, also say hello to the ever present fourth guest in our chat room.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.000
Live.vognetwork.com is the place to be where you can read comments such as Jason who says,

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
Rob sounds particularly more energetic tonight.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
And Brad from Pod Culture says, probably lots of coffee.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
That's true.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Yes, four cups today.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
That's true.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.000
Alright, we do have another guest joining us in studio.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Somebody new to the show.

02:09.000 --> 02:13.000
Can you believe there's still people in Sacramento who play video games who haven't been on this

02:13.000 --> 02:14.000
show?

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
But we do have somebody new to the show tonight.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
I don't know if you have a nickname you'd like to go by.

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
What do you want me to introduce you to tonight?

02:20.000 --> 02:23.000
Wordpress handle is Rakshasa Rani.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Rakshasa.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Are you a Kingdom Hearts girl?

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
Is that where Rakshasa comes from?

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
No, no.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
It's Rakshasa Rani.

02:28.000 --> 02:32.000
It basically translates to Ogre Queen, but I'm sure it's improperly conjugated.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
Okay, that's alright.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
That's alright.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000
Well, hello and welcome to the show.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Don't expect me to be able to repeat that.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Can I call you by your first name?

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Yes, go right ahead.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
I'm gonna call you Rachel because that's what your name is.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
So hi Rachel, welcome to the show.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Not Indian at all.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
But a good-

02:45.000 --> 02:47.000
But we could go rahel.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.000
A good plug for your Wordpress right at the top of the show.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.000
That's the way to sell your site here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
So, welcome to the show.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
You and Jamie go to school together or something like that, right?

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
We slave away on the magazine together.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Okay.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Good times.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.000
And we're both kind of subbing on the other side pretty much.

03:06.000 --> 03:10.000
You know, I've always felt more part of the writing process.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
But this year I'm on the design team whereas Jamie, who is an excellent designer, is now

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
on the English side of it.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.000
Yeah, so we're sort of crossed over.

03:18.000 --> 03:25.000
But that means we both see what goes on on each side and then go, what's up with that?

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
So, you guys are frenzies from school.

03:28.000 --> 03:33.000
So, how did you guys- obviously you guys connected because you're both obviously geeky gals,

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
which is great.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
We love geeky gals.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
How did you guys kind of find that connection?

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
Through many rides home.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Yes.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
And series of conversations the first semester.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
And yarn.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
Yes.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Oh, yes.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
And yarn.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.000
Which I'm working on during the show again.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Lots of you.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
More crochet.

03:49.000 --> 03:53.000
You were mentioning earlier that you are very experienced with yarn and all that stuff.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
So, very cool.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
And she's a fantastic potter.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Oh, thank you.

03:57.000 --> 04:02.000
And that's really my only contribution to the yarn store is because my mother's more

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
of a crocheter.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
My sister knits.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
I do these things called yarn bowls.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.000
And basically it's just, you know, yarn accessories works out pretty well for me.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
Well, all this talk about knitting and crocheting and pottery is going to go over great with

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
our teen male audience.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
But-

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
Hi, boys.

04:17.000 --> 04:22.000
Let me ask you a little- I play games and I do pottery.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Let's talk about games for a minute.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
Do pottery, not pot.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.000
We were talking a little bit before the show and you mentioned you have a love of Silent

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Hill.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Oh, yes.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
Yes.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
It's going to be really fun for us here at OLR.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
What's your favorite out of the series?

04:36.000 --> 04:39.000
Ooh, it's kind of a toss up.

04:39.000 --> 04:43.000
I kind of like 3 and 4.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.000
I love 4 for its story more than its gameplay aspects.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Interesting.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
You don't hear a lot of people sticking up for 4.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.000
I think 4 was better than people say it was.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
It was intriguing.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
But weird that you didn't say 2.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.000
I can't get past the voice acting.

05:00.000 --> 05:04.000
Did you ever try that Silent Hill HD collection where they redid it all?

05:04.000 --> 05:05.000
No.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
I haven't played it either because my understanding is they somehow made it worse.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
So, I don't know.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Go with that.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
What other games do you play?

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
What other games do you like?

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
What are you a fan of?

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
I've been playing a lot of Portal recently.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
I love Portal, but it's really on my 4-year-old nephew's account too.

05:20.000 --> 05:25.000
He's a huge fan of Portal 2 and that is literally the first thing out of his mouth any time

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
he comes over to visit.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
I've got that pretty much.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
I could navigate that in my sleep.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Nice.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
No wonder you and Jamie get along.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.000
She would not shut up about Portal until she discovered Mass Effect.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Yeah.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
So, now I've got to get her.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Oh, God.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
Did she suck you into that too?

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Not yet.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
I've been telling her about it.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
I've got Becky.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
Becky's already beaten the third game now.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Wait a minute.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
She's playing through Leviathan now.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Did Becky play a lot of video games before?

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
No.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
None.

05:53.000 --> 05:56.000
I should tell her that we're talking about her because she's actually making dinner for

05:56.000 --> 05:57.000
Julian right now.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
Oh, okay.

05:58.000 --> 06:02.000
But she's like, I found out that the controllers are ergonomic.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
They don't hurt.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
So, she's been playing through everything on Xbox 360.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
I figured it out.

06:08.000 --> 06:12.000
Mass Effect 3, or Mass Effect the series, is like Fifty Shades of Grey.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
It's like Fifty Shades of Garris.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Fifty Shades of Garris.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
There you go.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
A.K.A.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Turian Pene.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
Shade 1, calibrations.

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
Shade 2, more calibrations.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Shade 3.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Can you come back later?

06:27.000 --> 06:30.000
I'm trying to do some calibration.

06:30.000 --> 06:35.000
No, but I'm actually super looking forward to Omega.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.000
You have to play Mass Effect.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
The first one's free.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Go into our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com where you can participate.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
A supporter, Rachel, in the chatroom.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
Shane Olenko says, yay, someone else likes 4.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
4 was awesome.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.000
4 was pretty cool.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.000
Shane is a huge Silent Hill fan.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
So, let's see.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Enact Deft.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
Portal is the most fun.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
Portal is the most fun.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.000
Portal 2 is the best.

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
Those two statements contradict each other in an oddly positive way.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
I like it.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
I like it.

07:02.000 --> 07:06.000
Tigerclaw says, I don't even want to know what Turian Vag looks like.

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
You'll find out in the Omega DLC this week.

07:09.000 --> 07:15.000
Actually, there is an artist that I follow that did a very, very good comic called First Contact.

07:15.000 --> 07:19.000
It's about the whole, you know, Shepard Garris.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
It's not like First Contact with her butt, is it?

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
No.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
No, it's Turian Pain.

07:25.000 --> 07:30.000
But anyway, she also did a series of drawings of what she thinks the Vag of other species looks like.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
Why?

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Why, why, why?

07:33.000 --> 07:36.000
Because inquiring minds want to know.

07:36.000 --> 07:41.000
But the thing is, she's actually a super, super good artist.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.000
And that's what she spends her talents on.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
So her work is actually rather realistic.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
And it would make logical sense.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Oh my god.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
I can't.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.000
Did someone say portfolio?

07:55.000 --> 08:00.000
Anyhow, let me bring up another random comment in the chat room to try and stir this conversation in a different direction.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.000
I'm going to bring up another game I know you told me about earlier, Rachel.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
Brad from Pod Culture says, ooh, Steam has Arkham City for $7.50.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
That's another game series you said you were into, right?

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Oh, yes, yes.

08:11.000 --> 08:17.000
As a matter of fact, first time I installed Arkham Asylum, I did one complete playthrough throughout two days

08:17.000 --> 08:24.000
because I didn't want to have to, you know, yeah, I installed it and then I didn't register it or whatever.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.000
So I couldn't save it.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
So I basically just played the thing for two days straight.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
And then Arkham City came out, I played that thing into the ground.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.000
And like, I'm, you know, I come from a family of completionists.

08:35.000 --> 08:39.000
So it's like I was in there doing like every single Riddler challenge.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.000
And oh my god, I lost so much sleep.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
It's like I could feel my eyes just ready to fall out of my skull at that point.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
But you did it.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.000
Did you do all the DLC too?

08:47.000 --> 08:49.000
No, no, I'm saving those for a special occasion.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
And you haven't really finished it.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
I know.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Twitch, Twitch, Twitch.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
I was trying to see if I could get her to Twitch.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.000
Were you a fan of the comics before playing the game?

08:56.000 --> 08:58.000
Um, you know, not so much the comics.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
I got into the games mainly because of the cartoon connection.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Kevin Conroy, awesome.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.000
Ah, okay, the anime series.

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
Oh yeah.

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
And you know, him and Mark Hamill, they are basically Batman and the Joker for me.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.000
It's all kinds of happies.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.000
There's a lot of people on your team when it comes to that.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
So, awesome.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.000
Um, well, let's see.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.000
I was mad at the DLC.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Huh.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.000
I didn't play all the DLC.

09:22.000 --> 09:27.000
Well, you know the thing with, um, okay, the game's been out forever so I'm just gonna freaking say it.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.000
About, um, Harley.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
Jump ahead, quick.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
If you don't want spoilers, jump ahead.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Mute for one minute.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
About Harley's pregnancy test.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.000
And then, like, in the DLC there's like 20 bajillion of them that are all negative.

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
Oh, they're trying to fix that for a possible third game or something.

09:43.000 --> 09:46.000
Except, like, there was the ending where she was singing a lullaby.

09:46.000 --> 09:48.000
So, um, whatever.

09:48.000 --> 09:55.000
Or, you know, that would be like a defining character moment where she thinks she's pregnant but she's really gone even crazier.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
So it's like a Joker doll that she's calling her baby.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.000
I kind of like if it would move in that direction.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.000
Interesting.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.000
Interesting.

10:02.000 --> 10:07.000
She sounds like one of those crazy women, like the type that would draw vaginas of alien races and post them on her Tumblr.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
You know what?

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
I linked the Tumblr in the chat room.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.000
Oh, great.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.000
Thank you, thank you so much for that.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
I'm sure Loki's pulling it up right now.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Alright.

10:15.000 --> 10:23.000
For the record, Rob, despite the comic being fairly graphic, it actually is very...

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
It's artsy.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
It actually tells a story.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
We'll leave it at that.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.000
We'll leave it at that.

10:28.000 --> 10:33.000
Alright, I would have to ask you before we move on to a real kickoff topic.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Rachel, what's your gaming platform of choice?

10:35.000 --> 10:39.000
Do you have a particular console you tend to play stuff on or are you more PC gal?

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
Where do you lean?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Shiznite.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
Shiznite.

10:42.000 --> 10:48.000
You know, I tend to gravitate towards PC just because I'm big on retro games and a lot of emulators available there.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Ah, I see.

10:49.000 --> 10:55.000
Yeah, but if you twist my arm and force me to pick, I'd have to go with a Nintendo console just out of sheer loyalty.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
Oh, okay.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
You're one of those.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.000
No, I'm just kidding.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
Yeah, I'm one of those.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
Loki will love you.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
Alright.

11:01.000 --> 11:04.000
I don't know anything wrong with Nintendo consoles.

11:04.000 --> 11:08.000
Just, you know, the Wii U's just not worth the money.

11:08.000 --> 11:14.000
Well, we'll get into plenty more of that in a minute, but I did want to talk about some other kickoff topics here real quick.

11:14.000 --> 11:21.000
Obviously, we hope all you guys here in the States had a happy Thanksgiving holiday, you know, and around the world.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Hope you had a good week.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.000
Obviously, retail madness over the weekend.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.000
I kind of hate that that stuff is starting to eclipse Thanksgiving.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.000
I think a lot of people are growing very frustrated with it.

11:31.000 --> 11:37.000
But it is the time to get some good deals and the Steam sale, obviously, is another good place to get deals.

11:37.000 --> 11:42.000
Civ V, which I never showed up about on this show, great deal going on right now.

11:42.000 --> 11:45.000
I was really tempted to get Borderlands 2, which I know is on sale.

11:45.000 --> 11:50.000
I'm curious if you guys picked up any gaming deals over these past few days.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
Oh, yes.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
What'd you get?

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
What'd you get, Dark Sakura?

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
I bought They Bleed Pixels and Awesomenauts.

11:56.000 --> 12:03.000
And then I bought Dragon Age Origins, the deluxe edition through Origin, although I wish I'd waited and just gotten it through Steam.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
Because Steam was a penny cheaper.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
One whole penny?

12:06.000 --> 12:09.000
But I hate Origin. I prefer playing through Steam.

12:09.000 --> 12:14.000
And then I actually just bought Sonic Generations on Steam, because it's eight freaking bucks.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
And it's Sonic Generations.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.000
With a really screwed up last level, seriously.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
Because Dan and I sat and watched the whole playthrough.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.000
Nice.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.000
Rachel, did you take advantage of any of the gaming deals this weekend?

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
I did not.

12:28.000 --> 12:34.000
I was actually working through Black Friday, even though it wasn't really Black Friday-ish for our shop.

12:34.000 --> 12:39.000
I still saw a bit of ugliness, so I was more preoccupied with the working part of that.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
That's fair enough. Fair enough. It happens.

12:41.000 --> 12:50.000
You brave, brave retail people that had to work those front lines on Friday, I don't envy you in the slightest, because people are crazy.

12:50.000 --> 12:55.000
Although, I was telling you guys before the show, I went out on Black Friday at about eight o'clock at night.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
Because we needed stuff from Target. I needed shampoo.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
So we went to Target at eight o'clock. It's fine.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
We go out at night on Black Friday and after all the crazies have gone to bed.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.000
Totally fine. Just like any other day.

13:06.000 --> 13:10.000
Even went to Fry's and got some upgrades for the studio I'll talk about in a minute.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
Loki, did you take advantage of any deals?

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
I bought nothing because I have no money to buy things with.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.000
That's what happens when you're a parent. You have no money.

13:19.000 --> 13:23.000
I don't think it's just being a parent. You're also a homeowner and you just bought a new car.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
That's a big one.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
I don't know. I just feel like giving people crap for small reasons.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
Congrats on the used car.

13:32.000 --> 13:37.000
And also the other thing too, the last Steam sale I bought a bunch of games.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
I still haven't played most of them.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.000
And I haven't played most of the games that I got through my Humble Bundle.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
So I'm just kind of like, hey, that's cool.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
Borderlands 2 is down to like 30 bucks, whatever.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Am I really going to play it? Probably not.

13:49.000 --> 13:54.000
So it's just kind of answering the question, is this really something I'm going to play?

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
And a lot of times it's no, I'm probably not going to play that.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
So that's why I haven't really been buying anything.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.000
I didn't really buy anything either.

14:03.000 --> 14:07.000
I did buy another Wii U game when I was at Fry's picking up the new router.

14:07.000 --> 14:15.000
I got Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed for the Wii U just because some of my other friends had it and was giving it positive reviews.

14:15.000 --> 14:20.000
It's only a deal because it's one of the two non $60 games, I think.

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
I think $50.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
It's $40 actually.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
So I think I paid $40 for it.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Maybe I did get a deal and didn't realize it.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
Yeah, I think I only paid $40 for it.

14:28.000 --> 14:32.000
And I might have been a deal then because I think that was supposed to be like a $50 game.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
And I did get a deal.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Yeah, I only paid $40 for it, I'm pretty sure.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
So that's pretty cool.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
And there was one other game that was cheaper than the others.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
I don't remember what it was.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
Oh, well.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.000
Anyhow, let's talk about, since we are talking about the games we got deals on,

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
let's talk about our actual gaming weeks and the games we've been playing this week.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.000
Dark Sakura, why don't you start?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.000
Mass Effect 3.

14:56.000 --> 14:59.000
I beat 2. I'm on 3 again for like my fifth playthrough.

14:59.000 --> 15:04.000
My fifth playthrough in what, four months?

15:04.000 --> 15:08.000
And I actually touched some WoW.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.000
So you guys wouldn't kick me out of the guild.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.000
Going back to Mass Effect a minute, I mean obviously you've talked tons about it on the show,

15:14.000 --> 15:17.000
but I found the modding you were doing this week interesting.

15:17.000 --> 15:21.000
Because you were posting to our little rabid fan community we have on Facebook.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
And you had like these different colored skinned shepherds.

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
Like you went in and had like a green skinned shepherd and this weird stuff.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
Okay, I'll tell you where this came about.

15:30.000 --> 15:36.000
And this is actually me using a little bit of what I've actually learned in college about colors.

15:36.000 --> 15:42.000
And trying to make, I'm trying to actually match Zaid's skin tone.

15:42.000 --> 15:47.000
But a little bit lighter because I'm trying to get that, it's actually closer to Aller's.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
Because I want that kind of golden skin tone.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.000
I'm working on making a somewhat middle eastern looking shepherd.

15:52.000 --> 15:56.000
And I've tweaked the eyes, I've tweaked the nose, and now I'm tweaking the skin tone.

15:56.000 --> 16:01.000
But it's either coming out like too much of a muted chocolate.

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
You know, like the plain milk chocolate with no extra skin tone to it.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Nothing blushing, nothing under that.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
And so I'm playing with blushes, I'm playing with all this.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
And then I had an idea.

16:12.000 --> 16:18.000
I was like, well if all of this is showing through whatever the skin is, can I make a blue shepherd?

16:18.000 --> 16:22.000
So I changed all the values to blue.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.000
Which is 255 blue, 0 red, 0 green.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Blue shepherd.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.000
It worked.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
So then I did red shepherd.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
Then I did green shepherd.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
Then I did yellow shepherd, which looks more like puke green shepherd.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
But I could get it to work.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Because I've gotten purple hair.

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
The hair works.

16:38.000 --> 16:43.000
Congratulations for now fusing the fan communities of Avatar and Mass Effect.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
There already were blue people in Mass Effect though.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.000
There were a sorry.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.000
It doesn't matter, you don't need more blue people.

16:50.000 --> 16:53.000
But I was actually planning on giving her white hair.

16:53.000 --> 16:57.000
And then making her blue and calling her, you know, shepherd smurf.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
But no.

16:58.000 --> 17:02.000
But I mean that means I could play through my whole game with a blue shepherd.

17:02.000 --> 17:11.000
And I went back to, and I got a really nice skin tone that unfortunately only looks really nice in bright light.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.000
It's the picture that I posted from the Citadel where she looked kind of badass.

17:14.000 --> 17:19.000
And I've modified my coalesced ion eye to add extra outfits.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
There is a naked skin for female shepherd.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.000
However, she has no real butt crack.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.000
There's a naked one for the guys but I can't find it.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
What is it with the girls in the nudity tonight?

17:30.000 --> 17:34.000
It's no problem. You can fix that butt crack problem by just editing the texture.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
There actually is an edited texture.

17:36.000 --> 17:39.000
Buy her bigger panties. That's how you fix the butt crack problem.

17:39.000 --> 17:44.000
It's like there's no bits to show and no coloration in certain places.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
And someone has made, by the way.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.000
I found that ages ago but I didn't know that it actually was based off of real texture.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
And you can unlock the texture and it's like okay whatever.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.000
And who'd have thunk it? It's the person that draws the vaginas.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.000
No, it's not the same person.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
It's not the same person.

17:59.000 --> 18:06.000
But there's actually, did you know that there are two different fabric textures for the underwear?

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
There's shiny and matte.

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
I just learned something that I never thought I'd ever know in my life.

18:11.000 --> 18:15.000
But I've had my shepherd running around in an all black uniform.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.000
You know, it's actually black and a lighter black for the camo.

18:19.000 --> 18:28.000
I have seen some hilarious gifs on Tumblr of, I guess there's a way to hack it so that you can play male shepherd in his underwear through the whole game.

18:28.000 --> 18:35.000
And there's some hilarious gifs of like, you know, male shepherd like jumping out of a starship and he's like in his underwear.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
It looks really funny.

18:37.000 --> 18:46.000
No, you can actually, in the coalesced I&I, because basically all you do, you can add lines to have it pull different textures for different outfits.

18:46.000 --> 18:50.000
So you can actually wear armor in casual look and wear casual clothes into armor.

18:50.000 --> 18:55.000
There's also a way to use Ashley's clothes, but I went and looked through the actual meshes.

18:55.000 --> 19:00.000
The reason why there's a big problem with people using Ashley's face is first of all, it's fully colored.

19:00.000 --> 19:06.000
So if you have it over a colored face already, it's going to show up orange and part of her chest is rendered.

19:06.000 --> 19:11.000
So you'd actually get shepherd with a hole in her chest if you try to use Ashley's clothes with no boobs pretty much.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
Oh boy. All right.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Yeah, this is what I spent all week doing.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.000
You're going to need your own podcast about Mass Effect at some point.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
Just wait.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
All right. Moving on.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
But I did play another game.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
Oh, what else?

19:21.000 --> 19:22.000
Dragon Age Origins.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.000
And I made a Dalish, which I sometimes want to call a Danish.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
She's a redhead, kind of cool.

19:28.000 --> 19:32.000
And I don't know that I like the game so much yet, but I'm going to give it a try.

19:32.000 --> 19:38.000
You know, it might be one of those games that, you know, I didn't really love it the first time I played it, but I went back later and I liked it a little more.

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
Like it's just kind of sometimes games don't really hit you the first time.

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
I'm just really not a big fan of combat in it.

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
But I might go back and see about getting Dragon Age 2.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Gotcha.

19:48.000 --> 19:56.000
I mean, which I started playing on Xbox 360 and got pretty far in until that stupid battle where Fenris is like, I'm going to be emo and kill you.

19:56.000 --> 19:59.000
Now, see, that's really weird because most of the fandom really doesn't like Dragon Age 2.

19:59.000 --> 20:02.000
But it plays like Mass Effect.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
I mean, really, I like the way it plays. It handles like Mass Effect.

20:05.000 --> 20:09.000
That's why I could get into Mass Effect so easily is because it handled the same way.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
Well, you know, there's a third one coming out. Maybe it'll be somewhere in the middle.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Maybe.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.000
Let's see. All right.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
And I played very solitaire.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.000
Of course you did. Of course you did.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
It sucks.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
All right. Let me move on.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
Rachel, since you're our guest, why don't you go next?

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
What kind of games, what's gaming week look like for you?

20:24.000 --> 20:29.000
You know, since school is on, you know, I have a lot of time preoccupied just by schoolwork.

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
So the only time I really get to play games is when the kids are around.

20:33.000 --> 20:39.000
So it's, you know, more cinematic stuff like Pikmin, Portal 2, things with a lot of really bright characters.

20:39.000 --> 20:44.000
I am, you know, I am really, you know, I could never get enough replaying of Portal 2, though,

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
just because the mythos behind it is so fascinating.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
Because I'm a writer. I'm not sure if you knew that.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
I just learned something.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
There you go.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
The more you know.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
Yeah.

20:55.000 --> 21:00.000
So, and I just, you know, there's, I find something new in every single replay.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.000
Like, there's always one more secret door I haven't gone through.

21:03.000 --> 21:07.000
There's one more connection to Half-Life and just, you know, the way they paint their characters.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
It's, everything's pretty three-dimensional.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
So I appreciate it on a couple different levels.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
You should talk to Alan about Half-Life at some point.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.000
I was going to say, are you a big Half-Life fan as well?

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
You know, I haven't gotten into it yet.

21:16.000 --> 21:22.000
I'm, you know, I'm saving up a big chunk of time where I can just play, blow through the entire series so far.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
Now's a great time with the Black Mesa source being out there.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
Definitely look that up.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
I am. I'm going to blow through it.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.000
Then I can get pissed off that there's not an episode two.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
All right.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.000
Well, if that's all you want to share about your week, then I'll move on to Loki.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
How was your gaming week?

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
I played Black Ops 2 a bit.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
That was fun.

21:42.000 --> 21:46.000
And then a little bit of Modern Warfare 3, although this week we should be switching over to Black Ops 2.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
Just waiting for our copies from Activision to come in.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
And then a lot of Minecraft.

21:52.000 --> 21:59.000
Just been working on trying to set up the rest of the mob arena and also some other stuff.

21:59.000 --> 22:09.000
Because the website I had set up had went down because the free URL forwarding company, co.cc, went under.

22:09.000 --> 22:13.000
And all the, like, five million domains that they had are poof, gone.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
So I actually got a legit domain now.

22:15.000 --> 22:19.000
So it's now at vog-minecraft.com.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
And there's not really anything there other than the map right now.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.000
But eventually there'll be something there.

22:24.000 --> 22:25.000
So I put that in our chat room.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
Vog-minecraft.com.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
And there's also a Twitter account to go along with that.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.000
So, vog-minecraft at Twitter.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.000
Look at you!

22:34.000 --> 22:35.000
So, yeah.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.000
That's great.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
And, yeah.

22:37.000 --> 22:41.000
So I've been kind of busy with stuff this week.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.000
And then hopefully I'll get working on the website soon.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.000
I don't really know what I want to do with it, but I've got it for a while.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
So we'll play around with that.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
And then, what else did I do this week?

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
I don't think I played anything else.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
No, that was it.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
That was all I played.

22:56.000 --> 23:00.000
I actually had a lot of time to play some games thanks to the holiday break.

23:00.000 --> 23:04.000
And I didn't have too much going on outside of Thanksgiving Day itself.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.000
Obviously I've been able to spend more time with the Wii U.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
Because on the last show it was launch day.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.000
I had only really spent like an hour with it.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
So now I've been able to spend some quality time with the Wii U.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
And I've played three different games on the Wii U.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
And two of them are the ones that everybody's been playing.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.000
I'll talk first about Nintendo Land.

23:21.000 --> 23:24.000
Nintendo Land is a collection of mini-games, basically.

23:24.000 --> 23:28.000
I think it's framed a lot better than Wii Sports was.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.000
I think Monita, though, as a character will get a little bit irritating to some people.

23:32.000 --> 23:39.000
But she serves her purpose, especially for trying to get those that are not as familiar with how to play a video game acquainted with the games.

23:39.000 --> 23:42.000
There are some pretty neat games in there.

23:42.000 --> 23:47.000
I think I like the mini-games in it more than I like Wii Sports.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.000
Because let's be real.

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
At the end of the day, Wii Tennis was about flailing.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
There wasn't a lot of skill to it.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
There wasn't a lot that went into it.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
It was just like imagination with the help of this controller.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.000
Wii Bowling was slightly a little better.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
You felt like you were a little more in control of your actions.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.000
But it was kind of, eh, at the end of the day as well.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
I mean, Wii Sports, when all is said and done,

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
I know not everybody's going to agree with this comment.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
I understand why it ends up on the top 100 gaming list and all that.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
It was a very influential game.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
I don't think Wii Sports is actually a really good game.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.000
Especially if you're more of a hardcore gamer.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
It's really not a good game.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
It's a great technological feat.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
But it's not really a good game.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
I like Nintendo Land because as a gamer,

24:28.000 --> 24:31.000
I feel like there's more game in it.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
There's more to actually achieve.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
The Metroid Blast was fun.

24:37.000 --> 24:41.000
The F-Zero Race, it's certainly not F-Zero,

24:41.000 --> 24:43.000
but it's simple enough.

24:43.000 --> 24:47.000
Kind of like Atari 2600 basic, but all of these modern graphics.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
It's fun.

24:48.000 --> 24:52.000
The Donkey Kong course is surprisingly,

24:52.000 --> 24:56.000
like, it's like one of those Mega Man hard games

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
and all it is is tilting.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
But it's surprisingly quite a bit of fun.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.000
And some of the different mini games,

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
especially in a party environment,

25:05.000 --> 25:10.000
the Mario Chase, the Animal Crossing, Luigi's Mansion, all hilarious.

25:10.000 --> 25:13.000
We played those on Thanksgiving Day and they were all just a ton of fun.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
I think Mario Chase was my personal favorite out of the bunch,

25:16.000 --> 25:19.000
though Luigi's Mansion is really good as well,

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
and Animal Crossing is its own thing.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.000
But, I mean, at its core,

25:24.000 --> 25:28.000
those three games are all kind of chase games.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.000
They're just like a different twist on the chase element.

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
Like in Luigi's Mansion, you're hidden

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
and you're trying to grab the others before they grab you.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.000
In Mario Chase, they're just trying to grab you.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
In Animal Crossing, you control two people

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
and there's the whole eating the pellets.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
I mean, I guess it's a little more different.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
Tigerclaw brings up in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com,

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
what about that Pachinko in Nintendo Land, the Pachinko game?

25:53.000 --> 25:56.000
I call it Plinko, but yeah, it's pretty much the same thing.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Because, you know, they're pretty much the same thing.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
Pa-plinko?

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
No, Plinko.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
I know, I was saying Pa-plinko.

26:01.000 --> 26:02.000
Pa-plinko?

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
Instead of Pachinko, Pa-plinko.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
Pa-plinko? Yeah, okay, that works.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
But there's a Pa-plinko game you play to get the unlocks,

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
but, eh, I could give or take it.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
The unlock is a little bit silly.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.000
But as a pack-in game, overall, it's fine.

26:15.000 --> 26:18.000
I would see myself revisiting this game

26:18.000 --> 26:22.000
far more than I would revisit Wii Sports.

26:22.000 --> 26:27.000
Mario U, Super Mario Wii U, is great.

26:27.000 --> 26:30.000
It's HD Mario, it's what you'd expect.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
What I love about it is that it's not just a game

26:33.000 --> 26:35.000
with the depth of Super Mario World,

26:35.000 --> 26:38.000
but it has all these little extra modes as well

26:38.000 --> 26:41.000
to kind of enhance it, like the course

26:41.000 --> 26:43.000
for get from start to finish

26:43.000 --> 26:46.000
by getting the least number of coins possible,

26:46.000 --> 26:49.000
or speed runs, or all these other types of twists

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
that are built into it.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.000
And supposedly, it has some type of spot pass feature.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.000
I don't know if it's going to have leaderboards or what.

26:54.000 --> 26:56.000
But even if it didn't have all that,

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
I like playing those little side missions as well.

26:58.000 --> 27:01.000
The difficulty level of the game ramps up surprisingly quick,

27:01.000 --> 27:03.000
and there's some really hard stuff.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.000
I had to use an FAQ to get past one of the levels.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.000
I couldn't find the stinking door out of the ghost house.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.000
And then come to find out, there's like a second one

27:09.000 --> 27:11.000
I probably would have never have found.

27:11.000 --> 27:17.000
So I'm liking Mario Wii U as a really solid Mario game,

27:17.000 --> 27:21.000
even more than I think the one that was previously out on Wii,

27:21.000 --> 27:22.000
Wii Regular.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.000
And I don't know if that's just because

27:24.000 --> 27:26.000
the huge step up in the graphics or what.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
The only negatives I can see to the game?

27:28.000 --> 27:29.000
Go ahead.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.000
I'm sorry, just what popped right into my head

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
when you said Wii Regular.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000
What?

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
Does that mean that the Wii U needs fiber?

27:34.000 --> 27:35.000
Stop.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.000
All right.

27:36.000 --> 27:40.000
The screen doesn't do a lot for Mario.

27:40.000 --> 27:42.000
It does in multiplayer, as I understand,

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
because you can create blocks and all that stuff.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.000
But as a single player, all the screen does

27:47.000 --> 27:49.000
is mirror what's on your TV.

27:49.000 --> 27:53.000
If you want to do the whole I play something on my Wii U

27:53.000 --> 27:55.000
while you watch something on TV, that's great.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
If you have control of your TV,

27:57.000 --> 27:59.000
it doesn't really add a lot to the experience.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Luckily, it's a gorgeous game to look at,

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
even with all the little touches in the background.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.000
They have little dancing Miis that show up in the background and stuff.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.000
Just all these little touches that are really cool.

28:08.000 --> 28:12.000
And the sound thing that I really hyped up last week is great.

28:12.000 --> 28:16.000
The surround sound it kind of creates

28:16.000 --> 28:19.000
between the pad and the regular stereo is pretty cool.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.000
So, yeah, Mario is solid,

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
and I'm sure most people that will get a Wii U

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
will pick this game up, and it makes sense.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
Absolutely.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
One other game I've been playing on the Wii U

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
that was one of the launch titles.

28:33.000 --> 28:37.000
Sonic Racing, no, Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed,

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000
which is a game that's actually on the Xbox 360

28:39.000 --> 28:41.000
and the PlayStation 3 as well.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
They also have the Wii U version.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
This is the game we've been talking about on the show.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
We've kind of been joking about it and having fun with it

28:47.000 --> 28:50.000
because it has Danica Patrick very randomly as a character.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
It's an amazing eyeliner.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
And Wreck-It Ralph, and all these other Sega characters,

28:55.000 --> 28:58.000
like Metal Sonic, Beat,

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
one of the taxi cab drivers from Crazy Taxi,

29:01.000 --> 29:04.000
supposedly Alex Kidd gets unlocked at some point.

29:04.000 --> 29:10.000
I'm really surprised at how much I'm enjoying this game.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
And I took a look at some of the reviews online

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
and some of the talk in Miiverse and so forth,

29:15.000 --> 29:18.000
and a lot of people razzing it for being buggy,

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
and I will admit there's been some odd collision detection things,

29:22.000 --> 29:25.000
but nothing that detracted from the experience so much.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
I was, like, hating the game.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
In fact, I found myself most of the time

29:29.000 --> 29:32.000
actually really impressed with some of the level design.

29:32.000 --> 29:35.000
The stages are all huge stages,

29:35.000 --> 29:40.000
and they will seamlessly go from go-karting to flying a plane,

29:40.000 --> 29:43.000
and Danica Patrick's car turns into, like, an afterburner jet,

29:43.000 --> 29:46.000
which is kind of funny, and on the water,

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
and it kind of just seamlessly transitions between all these different phases.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
And I was liking it.

29:51.000 --> 29:53.000
I was showing you girls before the show tonight,

29:53.000 --> 29:56.000
I showed you the Skies of Arcadia level,

29:56.000 --> 29:58.000
and you saw how, like, you'll do the first lap

29:58.000 --> 30:02.000
and then in the second lap, the pirate ships, like, start attacking the town

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
and are blowing up the road and all this stuff,

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
and there's a lot going on.

30:06.000 --> 30:08.000
I was really into it.

30:08.000 --> 30:10.000
I got to admit, I'm kind of liking this game,

30:10.000 --> 30:13.000
I think, a little more than the online impressions.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
I mean, it's got not just a regular mode,

30:16.000 --> 30:18.000
but all these, like, special little games in it,

30:18.000 --> 30:20.000
like boost mode and kill the other people first,

30:20.000 --> 30:22.000
and there's a battle mode.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
You can play it online on the Wii U.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Apparently, the advantage that the Wii U has over the other versions

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
is that the Wii U is up to five players, thanks to the second screen.

30:31.000 --> 30:35.000
It's not just a copy of the first screen in single-player mode

30:35.000 --> 30:37.000
unless you want it to be.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
If you swipe the screen, you get a copy of the TV,

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
but if you don't, you get a rear-view mirror and a map,

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
you know, kind of what you'd expect in your racing game on the second screen.

30:45.000 --> 30:48.000
So, yeah, I was really surprised.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
I was kind of like playing it going,

30:50.000 --> 30:55.000
you know, Sega did help with that F-Zero game that was on the GameCube,

30:55.000 --> 30:58.000
and I got to say, this feels like kind of the closest thing

30:58.000 --> 31:00.000
I'm going to get to an F-Zero game for a little while,

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
unless maybe they're going to work on it, which I really hope they do.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.000
Sugar Rush.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000
Or, yeah, or just flat out do a Sugar Rush game.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.000
Sugar Rush.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.000
It's weird because the Wreck-It Ralph thing, like, I don't,

31:11.000 --> 31:15.000
I mean, it's cool that Wreck-It Ralph and Danica Patrick are in there, I guess,

31:15.000 --> 31:17.000
but there's not really a lot else.

31:17.000 --> 31:20.000
Like, you don't have the Sugar Rush stage, or at least I haven't got it yet,

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
or any of that, so it's interesting.

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
Going to some of the comments from our chatters at live.vognetwork.com,

31:26.000 --> 31:29.000
Tigerclaw says, the new Sonic racing game is a lot of fun,

31:29.000 --> 31:31.000
but boy, it gets pretty hard when doing the medium difficulty

31:31.000 --> 31:33.000
on many of the races and difficulty.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.000
I can't get past the drift challenges on medium.

31:36.000 --> 31:40.000
Yeah, I can do some of it on medium, but, like, the boost challenge,

31:40.000 --> 31:43.000
I couldn't even do that on regular.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
And here's a little tip for anybody struggling with a game.

31:45.000 --> 31:49.000
If you flop on a stage four times, it'll let you just skip it on the map.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.000
So, you know, but you'll still need stars.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.000
You'll have to compensate the stars from somewhere else

31:54.000 --> 31:57.000
in order to be able to get the unlock, so I don't know.

31:57.000 --> 32:01.000
Tigerclaw suggests that maybe some of the Wreck-It Ralph stuff will be DLC.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.000
Well, I don't know how the Wii U is going to handle that,

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
and I will say that part of it kind of concerns me

32:06.000 --> 32:09.000
that the Wii U doesn't seem to have a DLC system in place.

32:09.000 --> 32:12.000
It's the reason I haven't picked up Mass Effect 3

32:12.000 --> 32:15.000
is I hear that none of the multiplayer enhancements

32:15.000 --> 32:17.000
they've done since launch are available.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.000
And I'm like, well, then what's the friggin' point?

32:19.000 --> 32:22.000
Like, part of the reason the Mass Effect 3 multiplayer is so amazing

32:22.000 --> 32:25.000
is because of all the constant DLC they've been putting out.

32:25.000 --> 32:28.000
And I understand that some of the single-player DLC is included,

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
but they're not going to get Omega. Why?

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Because Nintendo can't do DLC yet.

32:32.000 --> 32:36.000
Or if they can, they're not doing it a lot or something. I don't know.

32:36.000 --> 32:40.000
So that part of it, with all the positive I'm saying about the Wii U

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
and overall I am satisfied with my purchase,

32:43.000 --> 32:48.000
I would be in love with my purchase if some of these other things were corrected.

32:48.000 --> 32:53.000
But, I don't know, Nintendo has, over the past week,

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000
been building a lot into the system.

32:55.000 --> 32:59.000
We got, over the past week, we got the Netflix, the Amazon, the YouTube,

32:59.000 --> 33:03.000
the Hulu, and all that showed up, like, you know, just day after day after day.

33:03.000 --> 33:06.000
And I gotta say, the YouTube app in particular,

33:06.000 --> 33:10.000
very different look from the other, the PS3 and the Xbox ones.

33:10.000 --> 33:11.000
It's not bad.

33:11.000 --> 33:12.000
Bobby said he didn't care for it, right?

33:12.000 --> 33:13.000
Huh?

33:13.000 --> 33:14.000
Bobby said he didn't care for it, right?

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
I don't remember what he said about YouTube,

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
but the look of it is weird because it doesn't really have any Nintendo branding

33:20.000 --> 33:22.000
and it doesn't really have Microsoft or something.

33:22.000 --> 33:26.000
It's just, it's kind of different and it works pretty well,

33:26.000 --> 33:28.000
especially if you're logged in.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.000
I enjoyed it more than the Xbox version of it,

33:31.000 --> 33:37.000
even though it functions similarly, but it still felt easier to use

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
and maybe part of that is having the touch pad, I don't know.

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
But, yeah.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000
I don't know.

33:42.000 --> 33:45.000
Tiger Claw on chat says Nintendo is just taking baby steps.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
This is a whole new thing for them, the online community.

33:48.000 --> 33:52.000
Well, yes, but at some point you have to stop letting that be an excuse.

33:52.000 --> 33:57.000
And I think a lot of us have said, oh, Nintendo, you're just new to the party,

33:57.000 --> 33:58.000
and so we forgive you.

33:58.000 --> 34:02.000
And it's kind of like, okay, that's true, but it's not an excuse.

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
Like, playing catch-up, you know, you've had a lot of time to play catch-up.

34:06.000 --> 34:10.000
You know, you should have thought about some of this during the Wii being out there.

34:10.000 --> 34:17.000
But there's some parts about the Wii U like Miiverse is surprisingly interesting.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.000
Like, it's actually something I keep going back to and looking at.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.000
I like looking at the activity feed of my friends

34:23.000 --> 34:25.000
and what they've been posting in the games.

34:25.000 --> 34:30.000
The first-party games really urge you to make public posts in Miiverse to interact with,

34:30.000 --> 34:33.000
and I find, like, I want to see what my friends are posting,

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
and the artwork people are doing is amazing.

34:36.000 --> 34:39.000
And I don't know if you guys know this, but in the Wii U, when you turn it on,

34:39.000 --> 34:43.000
if you have your Wii U always connected to the internet,

34:43.000 --> 34:48.000
it downloads artwork from around, you know, the community,

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
like things that have been popular voted.

34:50.000 --> 34:53.000
So when you turn on your Wii, you'll see a helping of, like, random games,

34:53.000 --> 34:56.000
and then you'll see some of the popular comments.

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
And they're all these artwork that is, like, really well done and funny.

35:00.000 --> 35:06.000
And so I find it really neat, and I don't know if this is what Nintendo intended,

35:06.000 --> 35:08.000
but you've got to hand it to them.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.000
This is something Microsoft and Sony aren't doing with their online,

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
so let's give Nintendo some credit here.

35:14.000 --> 35:20.000
The first thing you get when you turn on your system is community.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
You don't even get that with Xbox and Sony.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
That's surprising.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.000
So if there's one thing Nintendo is doing right when it comes to online,

35:27.000 --> 35:31.000
community is the first thing you see.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.000
Interesting.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.000
Agreed.

35:34.000 --> 35:37.000
Now, obviously, they have some slow steps in other places,

35:37.000 --> 35:39.000
but that's one step in the right direction.

35:39.000 --> 35:43.000
So going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.000
Raginator in chat says,

35:45.000 --> 35:48.000
Interesting or just a novelty that you'll forget about in a month or two?

35:48.000 --> 35:50.000
That's a very good question, Raginator,

35:50.000 --> 35:54.000
and I think a lot of that depends on how well will the games in the future support it.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.000
You know, and what else will come out?

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
What download content is going to come out?

35:59.000 --> 36:02.000
You know, what's going to keep the people talking?

36:02.000 --> 36:05.000
What's going to keep the people providing those funny pictures and so forth?

36:05.000 --> 36:09.000
And will they allow you to add cat pics later on?

36:09.000 --> 36:13.000
Well, apparently, like, people have been doing really random stuff.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.000
Like, I was reading something on my Facebook.

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
The Destructoid community took over one of the,

36:18.000 --> 36:22.000
I think it was the Rabbids game community with pictures of Willem Dafoe.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
I don't know what the joke is there,

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
but, like, they were drawing Willem Dafoe and writing.

36:26.000 --> 36:30.000
I mean, I don't, sorry, I don't have time to read every single website on the internet,

36:30.000 --> 36:33.000
but, like, I thought it was funny that they're kind of, like, trying to do that.

36:33.000 --> 36:37.000
But, you know, so yeah, people come up with their own ways to entertain themselves.

36:37.000 --> 36:43.000
So it's turning into Game Facts, basically, where they'll take over, like, a message board.

36:43.000 --> 36:47.000
I don't know how well they've succeeded, but yes, possibly.

36:47.000 --> 36:51.000
Fantastic. That's what Nintendo needs is more Game Facts.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.000
Mm-hmm.

36:52.000 --> 36:55.000
Bobby in our chat room wants to clarify some stuff.

36:55.000 --> 36:59.000
Blackwell says, okay, A, Nintendo has a DLC system in place.

36:59.000 --> 37:02.000
New Super Mario Brothers U will have DLC, for instance.

37:02.000 --> 37:05.000
Okay, that may be true, but where is it?

37:05.000 --> 37:07.000
It's not here at launch.

37:07.000 --> 37:10.000
That leaves me to think it's still being built.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
Remember my Winchester House comparison from last week?

37:12.000 --> 37:14.000
I think that's what's happening.

37:14.000 --> 37:18.000
I don't have any proof, but at the same time, where is the DLC?

37:18.000 --> 37:20.000
It's going to be there at launch.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
Remember, they've got six more years.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.000
Okay. Let's see.

37:24.000 --> 37:29.000
And Blackwell said, B, I think YouTube videos look better in the internet browser than in the app.

37:29.000 --> 37:33.000
And you can watch videos on the gamepad from the browser not available in the app.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.000
Blackwell also clarifying, I guess he reads more destructively than I do.

37:37.000 --> 37:40.000
Blackwell says, the initial joke was Jim Sterling said,

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
I am remaking the community to be about Willem Dafoe

37:43.000 --> 37:46.000
because that's a better use of this community than the game.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
The post got moderated away.

37:49.000 --> 37:53.000
Did you not see how many people were pissed off at day one DLC?

37:53.000 --> 37:57.000
How pissed would you be if there was day one DLC for New Super Mario Brothers U?

37:57.000 --> 38:03.000
But Bobby, I am pissed off that there isn't day one DLC for the other games to play catch up,

38:03.000 --> 38:05.000
especially when that DLC is free.

38:05.000 --> 38:10.000
So in the case of Mass Effect 3, yes, I do feel like 100% of the game isn't there,

38:10.000 --> 38:13.000
especially when you're trying to be competitive with these other consoles.

38:13.000 --> 38:18.000
I get that some of the single player DLC, but when you're kind of trying to play catch up,

38:18.000 --> 38:22.000
you know, I think that part is missing.

38:22.000 --> 38:26.000
I get what you're saying about the whole, you don't want day one DLC for New Super Mario Brothers Wii U.

38:26.000 --> 38:31.000
I get that, but that's also first party versus third party.

38:31.000 --> 38:35.000
And, you know, maybe Nintendo hasn't built it because they don't need it for themselves yet,

38:35.000 --> 38:38.000
so screw everybody else, I don't know.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.000
Anyway.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Alright, I've talked enough about the Wii U.

38:41.000 --> 38:45.000
Sorry guys, but it's with the hot thing that's going on in gaming right now.

38:45.000 --> 38:48.000
The other thing I want to talk about in my gaming video, just real quick, I'll just throw this out there.

38:48.000 --> 38:52.000
Despite the fact that I have a shiny new console, it doesn't mean I'm not going to play other stuff.

38:52.000 --> 38:55.000
I've been participating in the Mass Effect 3 weekend challenge like a good player,

38:55.000 --> 39:01.000
and I played an epic nine hour match of Civilization V, start to finish.

39:01.000 --> 39:04.000
And I know some people are going only nine hours.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Yeah, we did kind of an easier skill level,

39:06.000 --> 39:10.000
and we agreed the three of us that were playing would not military strike each other,

39:10.000 --> 39:11.000
but it was a lot of fun.

39:11.000 --> 39:17.000
It was my first Gods and Kings game, start to finish, so I was, you know, thankful I played it.

39:17.000 --> 39:22.000
And I am still enjoying Civ V, and it's on sale right now on Steam,

39:22.000 --> 39:27.000
and I would support a purchase of that if you wanted to do that.

39:27.000 --> 39:32.000
So, all right. Anyhow, that is all I want to say about my gaming week.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.000
Housekeeping tonight.

39:34.000 --> 39:38.000
Obviously, we always like to plug our Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r, and our Facebook,

39:38.000 --> 39:43.000
facebook.com slash orangelaungeradio, and our Google Plus, search for Orangelaungeradio.

39:43.000 --> 39:47.000
Also, this one's for the live listeners, more so than the podcast listeners.

39:47.000 --> 39:51.000
I'm hoping so far tonight, live listeners, we haven't had any dropouts on the feed.

39:51.000 --> 39:57.000
I know the fact that the stream has been dropping out lately has been very frustrating,

39:57.000 --> 40:01.000
and so we didn't really know if it was us or if it was the host,

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
but there's a good chance that it's us here in studio.

40:04.000 --> 40:10.000
So what we did on Friday, Alan and I went out and we got a new router for the studio here.

40:10.000 --> 40:13.000
So we have like a brand new, it's not like top of the line because I'm sorry,

40:13.000 --> 40:18.000
I didn't have 200 bucks to drop on a router, but we did get one of those like, what is it, 600?

40:18.000 --> 40:22.000
It's like 300 plus 300, it's a huge step up from what we had.

40:22.000 --> 40:27.000
Our last router couldn't even do wireless end, so we did upgrade that.

40:27.000 --> 40:30.000
We had this whole thing going on where you actually had two networks in the house,

40:30.000 --> 40:32.000
and one was daisy chained to the other.

40:32.000 --> 40:36.000
Now it's parent router and bridge.

40:36.000 --> 40:41.000
I wrote a post in the VOG Network forums in more detail if you want to see all the parts there,

40:41.000 --> 40:46.000
but I think so far the stream hasn't dropped, and the evil protagonist in our chat says,

40:46.000 --> 40:49.000
sounds great tonight, so maybe it was us.

40:49.000 --> 40:54.000
I didn't want to let that go forever without trying to fix it, so fingers crossed.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
Now that I've talked about it, it's going to drop in the next two minutes.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
Just watch.

40:57.000 --> 41:03.000
But hey, that's better than 20 times during the show like last week, which was very, very frustrating.

41:03.000 --> 41:08.000
So thank you to our loyal live listeners who have stuck it out throughout all those drops.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
We're trying to make the situation better for you guys.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.000
I hope it works tonight.

41:13.000 --> 41:17.000
Yeah, Raginator brings up, you know, by bringing up the stream dropping, you just jinxed yourself.

41:17.000 --> 41:25.000
Well, hey, you know what, we got through 48 minutes without one, which beats last week, so let's just hope.

41:25.000 --> 41:32.000
Also, it's a slow news week tonight, you guys, with the holiday going on and everything here in the States,

41:32.000 --> 41:37.000
but I will tease the coming up in Part B tonight, Match Game.

41:37.000 --> 41:40.000
We haven't done Match Game in at least a year, so we're going to do Match Game tonight.

41:40.000 --> 41:44.000
So we will have contestants, one via Skype, one via the chat.

41:44.000 --> 41:50.000
So if you want to be potentially our Skype player, make sure you have Orange Lounge Radio all one word added on Skype.

41:50.000 --> 41:55.000
Again, we're not doing that now. We'll get into it in Part B. I'll let you know when to call.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.000
All right, let's move on into some gaming news.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.000
All right.

41:59.000 --> 42:00.000
All right.

42:00.000 --> 42:07.000
So let's talk a little bit about this Xbox set-top box, which actually was a rumor that we've been hearing about for a while now,

42:07.000 --> 42:12.000
where there is supposed to be some slimmed down Xbox system that the rumor was, I think, originally,

42:12.000 --> 42:19.000
that it was only going to be able to play Xbox Live Arcade stuff, which would be a little weird, but I could see that.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
I mean, they have a lot of the whole Xbox.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.000
All the symphony of the night you can stand.

42:24.000 --> 42:28.000
True. Or, you know, if this is going to be like-

42:28.000 --> 42:29.000
So much Yaris.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
If there's going to be-

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
I'm interested in this.

42:31.000 --> 42:36.000
If there's going to be like a digital Xbox where it's not going to have a disk drive or something like that,

42:36.000 --> 42:39.000
it's going to be built into a TV like as an app.

42:39.000 --> 42:42.000
I could see it maybe like, you know, with games on demand stuff.

42:42.000 --> 42:45.000
I was just about to say, couldn't they do games on demand still, though?

42:45.000 --> 42:46.000
That's possible.

42:46.000 --> 42:50.000
All it needs is a USB port and you can suddenly, oh, magical 64 gigs.

42:50.000 --> 42:57.000
So they're saying, of course, anonymous sources are telling them that it's going to be dubbed Xbox TV.

42:57.000 --> 43:01.000
It's going to support casual games and run on Windows 8.

43:01.000 --> 43:07.000
I think it's just going to be kind of like running on, you know, the dashboard that's out there that kind of looks like Windows 8.

43:07.000 --> 43:13.000
And I guess some sort of, you know, chips that is going to allow for quick boot ups and that kind of stuff.

43:13.000 --> 43:27.000
And they're saying that it's also going to be able to kind of like, I don't know, maybe kind of incorporate, you know, surface stuff or smart glass or anything like that.

43:27.000 --> 43:33.000
And I guess, you know, Microsoft made a statement regarding the set up box plans.

43:33.000 --> 43:44.000
They're saying Xbox 360 has found new ways to extend the console lifecycle by introducing controller free experiences with Kinect and reinventing the console with a new dashboard, new entertainment content.

43:44.000 --> 43:49.000
The typical bullshit line they're going to give when the Christmas season is going on and they don't want people to...

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
Yeah, we are always thinking about what is next for our platform.

43:52.000 --> 43:54.000
In other words, yeah, that's probably going to be true.

43:54.000 --> 44:01.000
Yeah, in other words, don't think about what's coming out next year. Think about putting a Kinect under your Christmas tree this year. That's exactly what it is.

44:01.000 --> 44:06.000
I wouldn't put a Kinect under your Christmas tree unless you're into dancing games because all the games that have come out have been kind of crap.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.000
You know what I mean.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.000
I'm just saying, yeah.

44:09.000 --> 44:15.000
Okay, here, okay, I know this is going to sound stupid and I'm going to sound like an idiot, but hear me out here.

44:15.000 --> 44:20.000
Could this be a very corporate challenge to the Ouya?

44:20.000 --> 44:25.000
And I know that comparison is really weird because I know the Ouya's whole thing is open source and all this.

44:25.000 --> 44:35.000
But do you think still maybe Microsoft took a look at that whole thing and said, maybe people want a $99 thing they just took up to their TV and play games with.

44:35.000 --> 44:39.000
And although we sure as hell aren't going to make it open source, maybe we'll make it look like a PC.

44:39.000 --> 44:42.000
Is this maybe a response to the Ouya, if true?

44:42.000 --> 44:48.000
Probably not. I don't think they feel any threat from the Ouya yet because there's no real system there.

44:48.000 --> 44:51.000
I mean, you can't feel a threat about something that's not out yet.

44:51.000 --> 44:56.000
Not a threat, but it's doing what Microsoft does, taking an idea and trying to make it better.

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
For better or for worse.

44:57.000 --> 45:08.000
I think if anything, they would be kind of going with the whole, well, we've seen some of these integrated like, maybe even looking at Apple TV or something like that.

45:08.000 --> 45:14.000
Obviously, they're just a step away from actually having a system that runs apps and stuff.

45:15.000 --> 45:19.000
I don't know if it's really going to be anything.

45:19.000 --> 45:23.000
I mean, because if you think about it, let's say this comes out a year from now.

45:23.000 --> 45:33.000
Why would I want to buy a stripped down version of the Xbox 360 when the regular Xbox 360 is probably going to be under $100 or just about $100?

45:33.000 --> 45:36.000
I mean, if you think about it, yes, you may not be able to get the brand new system that's out right now.

45:36.000 --> 45:40.000
But those older systems, they're already at about $100 or just over $100.

45:40.000 --> 45:44.000
So why would I want to, you know, put out something that's going to...

45:44.000 --> 45:48.000
Maybe if it's one of those funky partnerships where it's all built into the TV.

45:48.000 --> 45:53.000
But see, why would you buy something like that that's built into the TV?

45:53.000 --> 45:56.000
Because why do people buy TVs with built-in Blu-ray players?

45:56.000 --> 45:59.000
Why do people buy TVs with built-in Roku and so forth?

45:59.000 --> 46:02.000
It's like those laserdisc players that had the Sega CD built in it.

46:02.000 --> 46:06.000
It's dumb. You should never buy a TV with something built into it.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.000
You know who buys that stuff? My parents.

46:08.000 --> 46:13.000
Because they don't release it. They just want the damn thing to work.

46:13.000 --> 46:20.000
This is what older people think about. Not to stereotype, but in my dealings with it, it's been true.

46:20.000 --> 46:23.000
They don't have time to figure out how to hook it up.

46:23.000 --> 46:28.000
They don't have all this. They want it to fucking work. That's it.

46:28.000 --> 46:32.000
And so now maybe you're recognizing, if you're targeting casual games especially,

46:32.000 --> 46:39.000
even though the thing might be capable of doing all this other stuff you're talking about with the more geometry wars and so forth,

46:39.000 --> 46:47.000
maybe the push is to grandma who enjoys Farmville now maybe wants apples to apples on her TV.

46:47.000 --> 46:51.000
Or whatever else Microsoft might reveal in the next year game-wise.

46:51.000 --> 46:55.000
I gotta be honest though. If you're saying that that's the reason that people would buy these TVs,

46:55.000 --> 47:00.000
I don't think those type of people would buy a web-enabled TV or anything like that.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
Because it's too complicated for them.

47:02.000 --> 47:09.000
Why spend the money to get this really expensive TV with a console built into it, like a gaming console,

47:09.000 --> 47:16.000
that first off is gonna use these really complicated controllers that grandma's not gonna have any idea how to fucking navigate.

47:16.000 --> 47:22.000
Well, because it won't just be a gaming console. It'll play the casual games.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.000
But it's gonna have all of Microsoft's other stuff too.

47:24.000 --> 47:31.000
It'll have all those channels with the built-in Hulu and the Netflix and all that same shit.

47:31.000 --> 47:36.000
I just don't think they're gonna do that. The only reason I don't think they're gonna do that is because other people have done it better already.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.000
And there's no reason to-

47:37.000 --> 47:39.000
Why wouldn't they want a piece of it then?

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Why wouldn't they want a piece of it? Because I don't think that they-

47:41.000 --> 47:45.000
Has that worked out well for them in the whole mobile phone department?

47:45.000 --> 47:50.000
Have they really taken a large chunk of the business from Android and iOS?

47:50.000 --> 47:52.000
Nope.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
When does that ever stop Microsoft from trying?

47:55.000 --> 48:03.000
Well, I think that they're definitely not trying as hard with Windows Phone 8 and stuff.

48:03.000 --> 48:07.000
I mean, it's probably selling alright, but I don't hear people going,

48:07.000 --> 48:11.000
Oh, I need a Windows Phone 8. It's more like, I need an iPhone 5.

48:11.000 --> 48:15.000
Or I need the next spiffy Android phone that's gonna come out.

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
I just don't-

48:16.000 --> 48:20.000
Yeah, it's a possibility that they'll come out with something like this to try to get people in,

48:20.000 --> 48:24.000
but I mean, I don't know why you would do it.

48:24.000 --> 48:32.000
But let's just say that, you know, there are people that will buy things that don't make sense.

48:32.000 --> 48:34.000
So, why not?

48:34.000 --> 48:35.000
Why not?

48:35.000 --> 48:38.000
Alright, well let me move on with some more news,

48:38.000 --> 48:44.000
and this is about some things that have gone on in the Wii U front since the console launch.

48:44.000 --> 48:49.000
Some folks talking about a Miiverse hack, and that Miiverse was hacked and all this.

48:49.000 --> 48:51.000
That's not really what happened.

48:51.000 --> 48:54.000
Somebody on NeoGaf said that they were screwing around with Miiverse,

48:54.000 --> 49:00.000
and they were able to get into the debug and admin options of Miiverse.

49:00.000 --> 49:04.000
Sounds like that wasn't really what it is, at least that's what Nintendo's claiming.

49:04.000 --> 49:10.000
Nintendo's saying it was a prototype that Nintendo did send out a statement to gamesindustry.biz

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
saying that what the user found was a mock-up menu.

49:13.000 --> 49:16.000
It's no longer there. It's inaccessible.

49:16.000 --> 49:25.000
And that could be believable enough, especially if MiU at its core is basically running off a web protocol,

49:25.000 --> 49:27.000
which is certainly possible.

49:27.000 --> 49:30.000
I think that's absolutely possible. The whole damn thing is running off a web-type based protocol,

49:30.000 --> 49:32.000
and we just kind of don't see it.

49:32.000 --> 49:33.000
Why not?

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
I hope that's not the case.

49:34.000 --> 49:35.000
It's probably very easy.

49:35.000 --> 49:39.000
So, whatever. I mean, I'm spouting like I know what I'm talking about,

49:39.000 --> 49:45.000
but it probably wasn't hard to find something like this in there,

49:45.000 --> 49:48.000
and I don't think it's very serious, especially if it was a mock-up.

49:48.000 --> 49:53.000
I mean, even just kind of looking at all the information on the screen, I don't think it's a big deal.

49:53.000 --> 49:56.000
Anyway, if you want to know the full statement, quote,

49:56.000 --> 50:00.000
It has come to our attention that some of the people were able to access a mock-up menu on Miiverse

50:00.000 --> 50:02.000
following the launch of Wii U in the U.S.

50:02.000 --> 50:07.000
Please note that this is only a mock-up menu and has now been removed and is not accessible.

50:07.000 --> 50:11.000
Remember how we were talking about those doors that you open up and just, wham, you run into a wall?

50:11.000 --> 50:14.000
Yeah, there's another one of those trapdoors right there.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.000
Someone stumbled.

50:17.000 --> 50:22.000
One other bit on the Wii U. I actually, you know, you've got to give Nintendo credit for this.

50:22.000 --> 50:28.000
This is a comment from Frozenbyte who made Trine 2, which is one of the download titles available on Wii U.

50:28.000 --> 50:33.000
You may not know this because it hasn't been talked about as much as the launch game,

50:33.000 --> 50:37.000
but there are like five download-only games available on the Wii U.

50:37.000 --> 50:42.000
I'm not talking about the retail land, but I'm talking about like $15 download games available on Wii U right now.

50:42.000 --> 50:46.000
I personally have not tried any yet, but they're available. I've had friends that talk about it.

50:46.000 --> 50:48.000
Do they have demos?

50:48.000 --> 50:50.000
Not now, no.

50:50.000 --> 50:55.000
Wow, Nintendo way to be in the forefront of, you know, digital content. Fuck, you know what?

50:55.000 --> 50:57.000
Again, I'm gonna get...

50:57.000 --> 50:58.000
PlayStation 1 had demos, I mean...

50:58.000 --> 51:03.000
Well, but the Wii has demos, so again, I'm gonna say, was it ready to go by November 18th?

51:03.000 --> 51:06.000
Look for it in December and January. That's the way it's gonna be.

51:06.000 --> 51:09.000
It'll happen. It just wasn't ready November 18th.

51:09.000 --> 51:14.000
But, okay, so they may not have demos, whatever, but let me get to this, because I do think this is worth mentioning.

51:14.000 --> 51:19.000
So, Frozenbyte, they made Trine 2, which is probably one of the more visible titles that's there.

51:19.000 --> 51:25.000
A quote from Mikael Haveri, who's the marketing manager, quote,

51:25.000 --> 51:32.000
We have the power to price our products as we please, with just some basic guidelines from the big guys.

51:32.000 --> 51:38.000
The step to this is purely from Nintendo's side, and they can clearly see that their previous installments have not been up to par.

51:38.000 --> 51:44.000
We can set our own pricing, and actually continuing on that by setting our own sales whenever we want.

51:44.000 --> 51:50.000
It is very close to what Apple and Steam are doing at the moment, and very indie-friendly.

51:50.000 --> 51:58.000
So, in other words, Nintendo's tried to fix some of this and make the DLC part of the, or the, you know,

51:58.000 --> 52:02.000
download distribution component of the Wii U a little bit lucrative.

52:02.000 --> 52:06.000
Free patches! You can do patching all you want for free.

52:06.000 --> 52:14.000
Considering we've heard the bitches from folks who make the Xbox Live Arcade games complain about the pricing of the patching over there,

52:14.000 --> 52:18.000
that suddenly makes this very lucrative. Being able to put your own game on sale when you want and all that,

52:18.000 --> 52:21.000
that's going to make this a lot more attractive.

52:21.000 --> 52:28.000
It will be interesting to see if, you know, if it actually leads to the games being made, because that's what it's really about.

52:28.000 --> 52:33.000
If that happens, though, if there will be any response from Microsoft and Sony.

52:33.000 --> 52:37.000
But you've got to admit, Nintendo's doing the right thing there.

52:37.000 --> 52:38.000
Yeah.

52:38.000 --> 52:42.000
So, very interesting.

52:42.000 --> 52:43.000
It makes good sense.

52:43.000 --> 52:50.000
Yep. They've told us there are no basic payments for each patch, and we can update our game almost as much as we want.

52:50.000 --> 52:53.000
For indie developers, this is huge.

52:53.000 --> 52:57.000
I wonder if that might be a lure for Minecraft. Who knows?

52:57.000 --> 53:01.000
Who knows? I like to just throw making up stuff out there.

53:01.000 --> 53:06.000
SSJ100Matt in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com wanted to bring this up about the demos.

53:06.000 --> 53:11.000
Wii U has kiosk demos. I'm sure it will happen soon.

53:11.000 --> 53:17.000
Jason wants to point out, Loki, iOS doesn't have demos.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
That's not true.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.000
That's not true either.

53:20.000 --> 53:21.000
It's up to the developer.

53:21.000 --> 53:22.000
There's light versions.

53:22.000 --> 53:26.000
Yeah, there's that whole light thing that they do, and now the whole in-app purchases.

53:26.000 --> 53:33.000
You don't think about it because it's different than how Xbox and PlayStation does demos, but developers found a way to do it.

53:33.000 --> 53:38.000
It'll be interesting to see how that plays out on Wii U if it does.

53:38.000 --> 53:40.000
All right, moving on with more news. DarkSakura.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.000
Oh, wait. I was going to add one last thing.

53:42.000 --> 53:43.000
Yeah, go ahead.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
There is actually some Wii hacks that actually happened.

53:45.000 --> 53:46.000
Oh.

53:46.000 --> 53:52.000
Legit stuff that it's not necessarily the Wii U, but it's run in the Wii U.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
I fucking hate how they have this.

53:55.000 --> 54:01.000
The Wii Channel on the Wii U, because that makes all the sense in the world.

54:01.000 --> 54:05.000
I will say, I might be the only person who didn't transfer their Wii stuff over.

54:05.000 --> 54:09.000
Like, I don't see the benefit of doing that right now.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.000
Can a chatter sway me that I'm wrong on that?

54:11.000 --> 54:13.000
Why would I want to do that?

54:13.000 --> 54:15.000
I don't know.

54:15.000 --> 54:24.000
There's a loader that was available for the Wii using Super Smash Bros. Brawl called Stack Smash.

54:24.000 --> 54:34.000
What it basically does is it uses a modified, I want to say a modified Brawl stage save file to run unsigned code.

54:34.000 --> 54:38.000
That exploit still works on the Wii U.

54:38.000 --> 54:44.000
So you can actually run Wii Homebrew through the Wii Channel on the Wii U.

54:44.000 --> 54:49.000
There was a game that was played in one of the videos I saw here.

54:49.000 --> 54:52.000
Also, they were saying that basically not everything works.

54:52.000 --> 54:57.000
You can't use the hacks to create the Homebrew Channel and stuff like that.

54:57.000 --> 55:09.000
They're saying right now, nothing that requires Hack Mii uses the current kernel exploits or uses AHB prot will work.

55:09.000 --> 55:14.000
It says that includes Devolution, USB Loader, CIOS installers, and Wii Linux.

55:14.000 --> 55:19.000
But it says Nintendo cannot patch Stack Smash using their current architecture.

55:19.000 --> 55:23.000
While it's technically possible, it would require a lot of work on their part.

55:23.000 --> 55:27.000
It could result in Super Smash Bros. Brawl being unstable for all users.

55:27.000 --> 55:33.000
Plus, it's most likely they knew that it would work before the guy posted the video.

55:33.000 --> 55:36.000
So in other words, hackers gonna hack.

55:36.000 --> 55:39.000
They're looking frantically for a way in that device.

55:39.000 --> 55:43.000
The clock is running. How fast can they find the way into the Wii U?

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
They already have found kind of a way in.

55:45.000 --> 55:48.000
Yeah, they found a kind of way in and they've also...

55:48.000 --> 55:55.000
There was a video here that I guess they're dumping the console keys from the Wii mode stuff.

55:55.000 --> 56:00.000
I don't really know what exactly they would use with that, but still interesting I guess.

56:00.000 --> 56:05.000
Interesting to note though, Nintendo is kind of doing something where, you know...

56:05.000 --> 56:08.000
Well, I guess Microsoft kind of does this too whenever you connect to Live.

56:08.000 --> 56:11.000
Is that it's gonna automatically download firmware.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.000
I mean, it'll download it overnight when it's not on and all that.

56:13.000 --> 56:17.000
So it's kind of like more how PlayStation Plus kind of does it.

56:17.000 --> 56:20.000
In theory, I mean, we haven't seen it happen first hand yet.

56:20.000 --> 56:24.000
Because there's only been the one patch which most people do when you first turn on the system.

56:24.000 --> 56:29.000
But in theory, this is gonna download things when you're asleep and they'll be there ready to install.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.000
We'll see how that plays out.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
Wasn't that what they were supposed to be doing at the Wii?

56:33.000 --> 56:36.000
I remember that you were supposed to leave it on and, you know...

56:36.000 --> 56:39.000
It would download stuff and you'd have that little ring light flashing.

56:39.000 --> 56:42.000
Which I really wish they had the ring light stuff on there.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.000
There were the messages.

56:44.000 --> 56:48.000
It's now the home button on the pad is a blue light.

56:48.000 --> 56:51.000
And whenever friends sign on and off, that little light lights up.

56:51.000 --> 56:53.000
Yeah, that's just not as sexy as it was on the Wii.

56:53.000 --> 56:57.000
It's not, but I just want to point out it's sort of there.

56:57.000 --> 56:59.000
Sort of there.

57:00.000 --> 57:03.000
Alright, now we'll move on to Dark Sakura and what she was gonna talk about.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.000
Yeah, I just started crocheting again too.

57:05.000 --> 57:09.000
Well, going back to some kind of old news.

57:09.000 --> 57:11.000
We all know what the R4 cartridge is, right?

57:12.000 --> 57:13.000
It is the little...

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
No, I don't know. Please educate me.

57:15.000 --> 57:19.000
The R4, it's a flash cartridge that works on the DS.

57:19.000 --> 57:23.000
You can use homebrew or pirated games on the system.

57:23.000 --> 57:26.000
And there's also ones called like...

57:26.000 --> 57:30.000
I had a Ninja Pass was one that I had that doesn't work anymore.

57:32.000 --> 57:38.000
But now Nintendo has really got a push on and got it with the Japanese government.

57:38.000 --> 57:41.000
That the R4 is now illegal to sell in Japan.

57:42.000 --> 57:48.000
Actually, it's completely banned by the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.

57:48.000 --> 57:55.000
It was illegal to sell since 2009, but importing it is completely illegal now.

57:56.000 --> 58:03.000
As far as other places that it's been banned, it's now banned in France and the UK.

58:03.000 --> 58:08.000
Amazon and eBay are no longer allowing this cartridge to be sold.

58:09.000 --> 58:16.000
And different Australian distributors have been successfully sued by Nintendo.

58:17.000 --> 58:24.000
I'm assuming it's still pretty available in the age-old venue of discreet brown paper bags in lavatories.

58:24.000 --> 58:25.000
Probably, yeah.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
I mean, if I wanted one, I could go get one.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.000
There's ways to get it. You can order them online.

58:30.000 --> 58:36.000
But it's now specifically illegal to import them in Japan.

58:36.000 --> 58:41.000
Not just sell them like it was the rule. You can't import it.

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
I mean, you could, but you could go to jail.

58:44.000 --> 58:48.000
Or have them stare at you sternly and force you to kill yourself.

58:48.000 --> 58:52.000
Well, probably a lot of it has to do with how out there you're being too.

58:52.000 --> 58:59.000
Because in Australia, I think it wasn't illegal to import the M-rated games because they had been banned in Australia.

58:59.000 --> 59:01.000
Like, I remember Mortal Kombat and the new one.

59:01.000 --> 59:03.000
Like, isn't it illegal to send that?

59:03.000 --> 59:09.000
I mean, now maybe it's not because of the whole new rating board, but before it was illegal to send a copy over there.

59:09.000 --> 59:13.000
But, like, how are they really going to find each and every person that does it?

59:13.000 --> 59:14.000
Not that I'm encouraging it.

59:14.000 --> 59:17.000
I think we all know why the R4 cart is being banned.

59:17.000 --> 59:18.000
Although...

59:19.000 --> 59:20.000
You can still buy them, of course.

59:20.000 --> 59:21.000
Of course you can.

59:21.000 --> 59:35.000
We remember the beginning of 2010, there was that UK guy who went to jail for a year for importing 26,000 games to set up with an R4.

59:37.000 --> 59:41.000
There's a difference between 26,000 games and me going on Craigslist.

59:41.000 --> 59:47.000
Yeah. Well, regardless, if people want something badly enough, they're going to find a way to make it happen.

59:48.000 --> 59:53.000
It's just that now it's officially a punishable crime. The end.

59:54.000 --> 59:56.000
And Nintendo just wants to put more hurdles up.

59:56.000 --> 59:57.000
They want to make it harder.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.000
Well, they want to protect their product.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
They're certainly well within their rights to do it.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
I get it.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:12.000
I mean, if you think about it, and I hate to say this, it was how easily replicated games were for Dreamcast that contributed to the Dreamcast failure.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Nintendo's already sitting kind of in a precarious position.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Right.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
So, of course they're going to want to protect their investment.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Which is a bummer because, you know, the homebrew element of it, you want to embrace, you want to be able to say, like, yeah, people should be able to run homebrew on it, but...

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Unfortunately, 95% of the people I pulled that number completely out of my ass aren't really using it for...

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000
Well, they're using it for homebrew and other things, you know.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000
See, I wanted to play fan translations.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
But, you know, it's not in the cards.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Although technically that's illegal too, if you think about it.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Yeah, well, they can bite my ass.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Yeah, I know that that's always, like, I'm always feel like that too.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
And I've talked about this on the show.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:54.000
That's when I feel justified in piracy, like, and I know that's a controversial opinion.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:57.000
I know you may not agree with me there and what have you.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:08.000
But like, if a company just isn't going to do it, then let me just freaking get the translation version or, you know, let me get it from the other country.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.000
You know, I went off on this casino blade.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:16.000
You know, it's people who really like a series that's going to put that fun and, you know, that effort into it.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:22.000
You know, and it really should actually more send a signal to the companies that fans want this.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
I mean, like, what happened with, um...

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Crap, what was that game that was on the Wii?

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Xenoblade.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Xenoblade, yeah.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Of course people wanted Xenoblade.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
And it was already, you know, in English.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.000
But no one knew it and then they did it because, you know, they realized, hey, it's stupid.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
People do want it, you know.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Apparently Last Story is doing...

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000
It's not like, oh my gosh, take off, amazing.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000
But it's one... I think it's like XSeed's biggest selling title.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Yeah.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Is the Last Story.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.000
So I really wanted to play that.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:58.000
And some people are saying it's not a bad thing because right now you can get it for 20 bucks most places.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:06.000
It's not a bad thing to pick up with a Wii U because it's kind of like, hey, has your Wii been collecting dust for three years but you're picking up a Wii U anyway?

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Here's a Wii game you might have missed.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Smart strategy.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Very smart strategy.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Frisbee seems to agree with us in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:21.000
If you don't sell a product to a country, they can't complain about lost sales due to downloading.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000
I know that's a controversial opinion. I know it stinks.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000
But I'm kind of like, you know what?

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000
It's technically right.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:31.000
The internet puts us in a more global community than companies want to sometimes acknowledge.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000
And that's just the reality.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000
And if you feel so bad about it, why don't you freaking import it?

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Import fees are so freaking expensive though.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000
And then region locking and all that crap.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Where's my disaster day in crisis?

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
There was another game that was in English.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Alright, let's move on with more news.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000
So Sony's credit rating is kind of crap.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:00.000
You know, they're probably going to have to go to one of those credit agencies that they advertise on TV.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000
But not really.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:12.000
So apparently one of the credit rating boards, I guess, out there, agencies, Fitch Ratings has rated them junk status.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Also, there was another company, I guess, Moody's, who I've never heard of.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
I haven't heard either one of them.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000
They've dropped theirs to, I guess, one notch above junk.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.000
So I guess it would be some people.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Some may call this junk, but I call them treasures, I guess.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000
That level.

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:45.000
They said the downgrade reflects Fitch's belief that the meaningful recovery will be slow given the company's loss of technology, leadership, and key products.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:50.000
High competition, weak economic conditions in developed markets, and the strong yen.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000
So, yeah.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000
So it's a company saying that they're going to fail.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:01.000
And I guess we just wait for them to either do so or not.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Am I correct, though?

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:09.000
I mean, I'm not up and up on all my financial world stuff, but I believe this doesn't mean Sony is failing.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:15.000
It means that the analysts believe it's going to tank because they see the downward trend.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Yeah, it's basically saying, hey, banks that are lending Sony money, they're at more risk on, you know, not being able to pay those loans back, even though they're a big company.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Big companies file bankruptcy all the time.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000
So just Twinkies.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Yeah, the hostess company.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
I mean, so.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Yeah, but also how many of Sony's CEOs are giving themselves raises every four months?

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Well, I don't know, but also you're talking about more of a global company than hostess was.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Sony's based in Japan. It's very different culture there.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000
True.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:54.000
But I mean, it's still if they have sound business practices and deal ethically, then I think that they can turn around.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:59.000
What happened with hostess was a pure bout of greed and poor regulation.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000
Well, one thing with Sony is that they're more than games, too.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000
We have to remember there's a whole lot of other facets of Sony.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:12.000
And even though their games may be doing OK, although I think people wish the PlayStation three were doing better, especially the Vita.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
It sounds like they're not doing well.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Well, I think that they weren't doing well.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:22.000
And just like some of the other fields, like, for example, Sony phones are Ericsson's not really a big thing anymore.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000
TVs.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Everybody goes off brand and gets the Black Friday 200 dollar TV.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:33.000
However, Toshiba and Panasonic and Samsung have really pushed in LG, especially.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Those brands have really surpassed Sony in quality, though.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:42.000
And I don't think people are buying cameras as much anymore because now the cameras and camera phones are all right.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000
I mean, they're, you know, multi megapixel cameras.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
And for a lot of people, that's just enough.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.000
They don't need anything dedicated to just a camera unless you're actually really in the photography.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Well, I'll tell you this.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:59.000
My iPhone camera is tons better than the digital rebel that my husband has bought four years ago.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Dungeon Buster in our chat room.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Sony has a lot of internal issues that contributed to their failure.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000
They have had a lot of shifting and things going on lately.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Bob Coffee says the strong yen is what's fucking Japanese companies bad.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000
That exchange rate.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Dungeon Buster also clarifies his earlier comment saying all of their competitors hired who they tried to force into early retirement.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Hmm.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:26.000
So, yeah, we have to remember Sony is more than just games.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.000
But it's not like their games are performing, especially the Vita.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.000
I mean, that that's not looking pretty for Sony right now.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Another thing, too, is that companies in Japan don't have those the rules regarding single types of products to like,

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:46.000
for example, Toyota also makes housing house housing siding.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Takara, you know, makes toys and wine.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:54.000
You know, it's the companies are allowed to branch out into other areas and expand.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:00.000
I mean, how else I think could Nintendo go from a card company to a, you know.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:06.000
A computer entertainment company. But I think the point is, though, is that first of all,

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000
I agree with the comment regarding the strength of the yen,

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:15.000
especially when you're dealing on an international market with other economies that you're relying on that don't have as strong

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Fundage, then, yeah, you're going to run into a lot of problems on the exchange as well.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Since I brought up the Vita, I do want to remind people, if you've been neglecting your Vita,

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:29.000
PlayStation Plus just came out on the Vita and there was a 2.0 patch for everybody.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.000
So just, you know, go turn on your Vita if you haven't in a while.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
I didn't play enough of this game to really review it this week.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:38.000
I'll talk about it next week. But my early impressions of Gravity Rush,

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000
which is one of the free games on Plus right now.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Neat. I'm really liking what I see. It's like one of these games I'm like,

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000
I think people totally missed this. I mean, I know it has its fans.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
I've heard some people talking about it on Twitter and so forth.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.000
But like, more people should be talking about Gravity Rush.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.000
It's pretty great from what I've played of it so far.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000
And that's a free one on PlayStation Plus and the Uncharted game, of course.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
And Wipeout. Wipeout is supposed to be one of the best.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
It was one of the best looking games at launch.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.000
And Tactics PSP, which, you know, some of you might not have even bothered to pick up or whatever.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.000
It's free. So PlayStation Plus on Vita, looking nice right now.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
So if you have a Vita and you happen to have PlayStation Plus,

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
I would really urge you to go check that free shit out.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:23.000
Even if you don't want to, the 2.0 upgrade allows the wireless transmissions,

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:25.000
which is one of those duh, this thing should have been there in the beginning.

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.000
And all those features, which is great. So there you go.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:34.000
And ShadowNextGen does want to say in chat, actually PlayStation is losing Sony money right now.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000
The Vita has hurt them a lot. Yeah, I mentioned the Vita earlier.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:43.000
And I just, the sales in Japan and the US and everywhere really don't look good.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:48.000
I think their opportunity with some of these games, I think was it,

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:53.000
the company that worked on Resistance and did the Call of Duty PS Vita versions.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000
That was bad. They hurt them bad.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Because Resistance is a great first person shooter franchise from Sony.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:04.000
And it just, it sucked on the Vita.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.000
And then, come to find out, and I was just very cautious,

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:12.000
I was like, ooh, black ops on the Vita, that's going to be awesome.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Then I saw what I was making, I was like, oh, wait a second.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:19.000
Maybe I'll wait until the reviews come out. And sure enough, total crap.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Yeah, it's like, what happened to that, what was it?

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Was it Game Developers Conference or one of those other,

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.000
where Sony just came out and said, we've got over 100 games coming to the Vita.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Where are they? What happened?

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Final Fantasy X, we're going to remake that. When?

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000
I don't know.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Uh-oh, are people abandoning ship? What's happening?

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:52.000
So, yeah, that's what I'm worried about, is that as the Vita kind of continues to not perform so well,

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000
those parties are going to get off that sinking ship.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000
You know what's going to really help it?

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000
In February, when Defense Force 2017 portable comes out.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.000
Yeah, there you go. Keep on hoping. Keep on hoping.

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:06.000
All right, let me move on here. I want to talk about this.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000
I noticed when I was playing Curiosity this week, well, you don't really play Curiosity.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Yeah, I tried playing that while waiting for my car to be looked at,

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:18.000
because I took it to a dealership, just to say, hey, is there anything wrong with this?

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Can you take a look at it, just to see if there's anything wrong with the car?

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Wasn't anything, which is good.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:29.000
But, yeah, I tried playing that, and it's like, oh, hey, cool, it's not updating. Awesome.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:36.000
It works all right for me, and it's more like, again, I think I called it bubble wrap on last week's show,

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.000
and that's pretty much what it is. There's not really a game there. It's just tap, tap, tap.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:47.000
You can do combos. Come on. It's pressing squares to make them disappear. It's not rocket science.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:56.000
I was very intrigued that one of the layers on the Cube this week was an ad for a Kickstarter called Godus,

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:03.000
or not like Godus, like a female god, but like Godus, G-O-D-U-S, Godus.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Not really. It's Godus, which is supposed to be a reinvention of Populous.

01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:15.000
I thought, actually, I got to be honest, as much as I think Curiosity is interesting and all,

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.000
that was tacky as shit, having that Kickstarter in there.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:25.000
I wouldn't put it past Molyneux, though. The more I was thinking about it, I was like,

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:31.000
that is so a thing for him to do. But, anyway, I just found that tacky as shit.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:37.000
But, regardless, I think it's neat that he's revisiting the Populous idea,

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.000
because I think that game in particular was a great game.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:47.000
So, that is something that he started a Kickstarter for. It's available on, of course, Kickstarter.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:57.000
They want 450,000 pounds to do the Rebirth of God games for PC, iOS, and Android.

01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:03.000
And, you know, you can look at more details on the Kickstarter if you want about what all you can get from it.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.000
But that is on his plate for games he wants to do.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.000
I thought the 22 Cans had these other games lined up. Like, I remember reading about one.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.000
I thought the next game was supposed to be Cooperation or something was supposed to be the next game for 22 Cans.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:20.000
So, I don't know where this fits into it, if this is, like, an actual 22.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Because, remember, 22 Cans is because Molyneux's got 22 ideas for iOS games.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Whatever. I don't know where this fits into it. I don't know if this is one of the 22 or if this is, like, a bonus or what.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000
I hope it's as good as Populous. I guess that's all I can say.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.000
I'm not giving him any money. No.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:48.000
I just, I was kind of turned off by the ad in Curiosity. Like, I don't, I can't explain it. Like, it just, it was tacky.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:55.000
I don't know. It turned me off to Curiosity, too. Is that what we're tapping away at? The big mystery in advertisement?

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000
Hmm.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000
Alright, let's move on. Dark Sakura.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.000
My computer just did something bizarre. Hold on. There we go.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:18.000
So, as was teased earlier when we talked to Bobby, there's a game that I'm super excited about that's coming out on the 3DS through the Nintendo eShop.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:24.000
And that is Space Harrier! Yay!

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Mind you, it's not, like, I think the Sega Ages one. It's a currently redone 3D version of Space Harrier.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.000
So I'm pretty excited about that because it's one of my favorite games ever.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:52.000
And I'd actually, I think I've put it as, like, number three on my top games list. Like, number one being The Guardian Legend, number two being Fantasy Zone, and number three being Space Harrier.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:56.000
So, welcome to the Fantasy Zone. Get ready.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Now you gotta get a 3DS.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:05.000
You wanna know what's funny, Rob? I have about seven versions of Space Harrier at home.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
Tell me you don't want this one.

01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:11.000
I actually do have a 3D version of this game.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.000
But you don't want the fancy new one? You don't want the 2012 or 2013 version?

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:18.000
But keep in mind, the 3DS does give me headaches.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000
You don't have to play in 3D mode.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Then I could just play my Sega Ages one.

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.000
One of my Sega Ages ones.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:33.000
Alright, let's move on and travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out a little sooner than Space Harrier 3DS.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:39.000
With release dates, I don't know if it's slowing down now or what's happening, but Loki, tell us about release dates.

01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:42.000
Yeah, it's quite slowed down now.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Not a whole ton coming out this week. In fact, pretty much just a couple things.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:52.000
You've got the American Mensa Academy on the 3DS.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:58.000
Ratchet and Clank Full Frontal Assault on PS3.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:04.000
Kids learn and play Pets and Vets on the DS and...

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000
I think that actually might be it.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.000
Oh, Scribblenauts Unlimited on PC.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:18.000
I guess that wasn't ready to go yet.

01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:22.000
Alright, well, traveling to Japan, since it's a little different over there and they didn't really have Black Friday.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:25.000
You still have some games coming out in Japan.

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:29.000
Darkciders 2 comes out, as well as Love Tor.

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Love Torre, probably. Mint version in limited and regular editions.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.000
And this is a sequel to Sweet.

01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000
For a moment, I thought you said Toire.

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:42.000
Which means toilet.

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:43.000
Love Toilet?

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.000
Yeah.

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000
No, I don't think these girls are having fun in Love Toire.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.000
That's what it says. Toire.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Toire.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.000
Let's see. Let me read the little description for this.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000
Hold on. Go away, box art. Go back to the description here.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.000
I think I would play a game called Love Toilet.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Box description.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
It's already been brought in.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000
Box description.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.000
Gigantic, soulless eyes.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.000
Kinda.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000
Alright, let's move on to the PlayStation 3.

01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:38.000
On the PlayStation 3, Darkciders 2 is there as well.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000
As well as Power Smash 4 going into the Sega The Best collection.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Shin Sangoku Musou Online, Ryujin Orambu 5th Anniversary Pack.

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:50.000
That's probably just a repackaging of Shin Sangoku.

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Sports Champions 2 makes its way to Japan on the 29th as well.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:02.000
And Dai 2G Super Robot Taisen Original Generations in the regular and Blu-ray disc box.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.000
So that's probably one of them combo packs.

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000
Looking at the PlayStation Vita this week.

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.000
Fate Stay Night, Power Smash 4.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.000
Price reduction there as well.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.000
And Samurai and Dragons, Ryuzoku Kurin.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:26.000
As well as a new game called Totori no Atlier Plus Arland no Renken Jutsuji 2 comes out over there as well.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:32.000
Sorry to interrupt, but is Samurai and Dragons pretty much their version of Cowboys and Aliens?

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
It very well might be, I don't know.

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.000
I've heard these Atlier games though. There's one of them on PlayStation 3 out here.

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:40.000
There's a few out on PlayStation 3 out here.

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Look at these two.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:45.000
I don't think these two chicks who are embracing in this picture are wearing a top.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.000
Just pointing out.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.000
Or legal.

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.000
Or legal.

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000
Just saying.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000
They're embracing in a bath house, I'm sure.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:55.000
The graphics look pretty though outside of that picture.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:17:57.000
Very cel shading and all that.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:02.000
Let's see, Totori brings her tools, her books, and everything colorful to the PS Vita.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:05.000
Forget about saving the world, you have more important business to attend to.

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:12.000
Namely, collecting your ingredients, learning new recipes, creating powerful items, and completing missions set by the guild.

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.000
In this game where you have a schedule to follow, every moment counts.

01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.000
The PS Vita game includes new modes and upgrades.

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:24.000
People who adore Totori's motherly elder sister, Cici, can include her in the playing team right away.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.000
There's also new enhancements and contents exclusive to the PS Vita version.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:29.000
So maybe this is like a redo of that PS3 game.

01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:34.000
Bob Coffee actually went back and made a comment about the love tote.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:35.000
Yeah.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:39.000
You got served cross bring it on equals moe moe pawa.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:45.000
On the Wii U in Japan, not yet. December 8th is the big day.

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:48.000
So we got another week to go before we talk about Wii U in Japan.

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:54.000
But we can talk about the Nintendo 3DS and Naruto SD Powerful Shippuden.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.000
Because what would the week be without a Naruto game?

01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:02.000
Also, Layton Kaiju vs. Gaikuten Saiban comes out from level 5.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.000
Oh hell yeah.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.000
Yes! That needs to hurry up and come out over here so quickly.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.000
You know who that is, right?

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:10.000
That's Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright.

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:12.000
Phoenix Wright. Hell yeah.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:14.000
I didn't even, like I heard this.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:16.000
Didn't you see the trailer?

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000
I thought this was a thing like in development.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000
I didn't realize this was like coming out in Japan now.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.000
Yeah.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:24.000
Did you watch the trailer for this?

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
I think I did a long time ago now that you talked about it.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000
Pretty epic.

01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000
Really?

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.000
It's pretty cool.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.000
Sort of semi off topic.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000
There's now a Phoenix Wright movie.

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.000
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.000
Yes.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:39.000
Hopefully something will get here a little easier to obtain.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.000
Oh yes.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.000
Well I guess the internet's not much easier than that but you know.

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:45.000
Alright, that's going to do it for Japanese releases.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.000
Let's go over to the UK, Dark Sakura.

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.000
On the 26th we have LEGO Lord of the Rings.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:54.000
On the 27th we have Battlefield 3 Aftermath and Mass Effect 3 Omega.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:58.000
I'm glad that like for DLC it gets its own release date.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.000
That just makes me so happy.

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:02.000
Because they respect Mass Effect.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:11.000
On the 20th of November Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition, Miasmada on PC and Stealth Bastard Deluxe.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.000
That's the best name.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:13.000
Stealth Bastard.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.000
Or maybe it would be Stealth Busted.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.000
You know, Eddie Iser just to be believed.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000
On the 29th, Arrow Porter on 3DS.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:31.000
The 30th, Ben 10 Omniverse, Epic Mickey 2, The Power of 2, Far Cry 3, FIFA 13, Little Inferno, Warriors of Roshi 3 Hyper.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000
The Wii U.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:36.000
The Zone of the Enders HD Collection.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:43.000
And let me see what I've got for, if there's anything on December 1st, hold on.

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.000
God, I can't believe it's already almost December.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.000
No, nothing until the 4th.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:54.000
Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000
But first, Loki.

01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000
Yes.

01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:59.000
So let's talk a little bit about Telltale Games.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:06.000
And thankfully it's not about them closing down, but actually they're expanding starting spring 2013.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:11.000
And what they're going to do is, I guess, they're moving out of their current office.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:16.000
They're going to, I guess, get an office that's almost twice as big.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:26.000
And right now they're looking to up their staff by, it looks like, 35 people starting in March and April of 2013.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.000
And I guess that's good news that they're doing well.

01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000
So they've got, of course, a lot of games out right now.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:35.000
They just finished up the second season of Walking Dead.

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.000
Or I guess, yeah, they're working on the second season of Walking Dead.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:47.000
The first season just finished and actually should be coming out on a disc retail version two weeks from now.

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:51.000
So, pretty cool.

01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000
I agree with Bobby.

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:57.000
I hear great things about the Walking Dead.

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000
I have heard so much good stuff about that.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:03.000
A lot of people saying that's the game of the year right there is the Walking Dead.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000
I just haven't had a chance to play it.

01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000
There's so much stuff going on right now.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.000
There's, you know, a new game every day.

01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:14.000
But I want to take the time to sit down and play the Walking Dead at some point.

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:21.000
I am, some people on Twitter went so far as to say it is the best ending ever in a video game.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.000
Kira, I don't want to see your spoilers, but I'm very curious.

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000
I haven't watched any of the show, so...

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000
It's not based on the show. It's based on the books.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.000
Or the comics or whatever.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:34.000
So you don't need to watch the show to understand it.

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.000
That was made pretty clear when the game first came out.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.000
So it's very different.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:46.000
But obviously, a lot of people who are into the show, which is a very popular show, are into this for similar reasons.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.000
Regardless, it sounds like it came out better than Jurassic Park.

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000
To be fair, I didn't play that either.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000
Now that song is stuck in my head.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Jurassic Park is frightening in the dark.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:58.000
Jurassic Park is frightening in the dark.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000
Alright, let's see.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:06.000
One more on Ubisoft and a comment they made this week about this current console generation.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:11.000
Ubisoft doesn't want the next console generation to go quite as long.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:14.000
This was in a talk with Polygon.

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.000
I can never say this guy's name right. Sorry in advance.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
Yves Guillemot?

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.000
I don't know. It's French, so...

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000
How would you say that? Right there.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000
Wilmot?

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.000
Wilmot?

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000
Well, that's basically...

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Yves Guillemot!

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000
I think it would be Yves.

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
Yeah, he's the CEO at Ubisoft.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000
It's Yves. Haha, I'm French!

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.000
Stop it.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:46.000
Alright, he's the CEO at Ubisoft and he said that basically it's kind of taken a while for hardware to come out.

01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:52.000
Quote, we are used to the changing machines every five years.

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:59.000
When a console is out for a long time, you don't take as much risks on totally new IPs because even if they are good, they don't sell as well.

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:03.000
That's kind of an interesting comment because...

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Zombie U is an Ubisoft game on the Wii U.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:12.000
I'm not hearing a lot of good things from critics, but I'm hearing a lot of great things from players.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:18.000
I obviously will trust the players a little more and I'll trust the critics, but I'm very curious about that game because it seems to be very polarizing.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
And it's like a new thing.

01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.000
A lot of people saying it's like an old Resident Evil game kind of mixed with Dark Souls.

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000
Which sounds very scary.

01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:28.000
But yeah.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:35.000
So, he's basically saying that when a console is out for a long time, you don't want to take risks because they don't sell as well.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:42.000
Is that the reason that it feels like this cycle has gone on way too long?

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:45.000
Or is that the rise of the mobile phone industry? I'm not sure.

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:50.000
I really get bothered though when I keep seeing traditional game companies.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:57.000
I saw one article somewhere this week that was like, if you're a traditional game company, you're going to be dead in the water if you're not developing for mobile.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.000
Your thing is dying.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.000
And I'm just kind of like, no it's not.

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:10.000
I'm like, there's an audience that does, I mean it might not be as big or whatever, but there's definitely an audience that doesn't want that mobile gaming stuff.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.000
I can't get what I need on mobile phone.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.000
The Apple iPhone cannot game the way a console can.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.000
When I get Mass Effect fully on my phone, maybe, but Infiltrator doesn't cut it.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:22.000
No, Infiltrator kind of sucks.

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.000
Like it looks good, but the controls ruin it.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.000
I touched it, but eh.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:28.000
The controls ruin it.

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.000
Oh Rob, I touched it.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:38.000
I don't know, but how can the next console generation be shorter?

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:42.000
They're not going to sell consoles saying, oh well we'll have a new one out in just four years.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:48.000
They kind of want to encourage people that this next console may have to be the last one they ever buy.

01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000
Although we all know that's not true.

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:52.000
I mean you'll still be upgrading your PCs.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:58.000
But even Alan kind of made a point the other day that even PC upgrades have kind of slowed a little bit.

01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:02.000
Especially now versus maybe where we were at ten years ago.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:06.000
We've kind of hit this cap.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:08.000
I don't know.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.000
Alright.

01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:14.000
BlackWolf in our chatroom says, gaming on my TV will never die.

01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Amen to that.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.000
Let's see.

01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.000
ActDeaf talking about the Walking Dead game.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:24.000
The game is really damn great, though I've only played the first two episodes.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:28.000
Duke Nukem wants a Breaking Bad game after the series ends.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000
That's another one I hear a lot about.

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:32.000
No thank you, that show is awful.

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000
You didn't like it?

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000
I fucking hate that show.

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:38.000
I also hate Sons of Anarchy.

01:26:38.000 --> 01:26:40.000
The acting in both are great.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000
I hate the subject matter.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000
I hate how the episodes go.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:50.000
I hate basically awful, horrible people being put in a positive spotlight.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:52.000
You know.

01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:54.000
Okay yeah, Hitler was an artist, but that doesn't mean I'm a fan.

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Pinning an apartment in one afternoon, two coats.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:02.000
I only have time to watch RuPaul's Drag Race.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.000
Alright.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:12.000
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, mouse.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.000
Let's travel to a time when we didn't even have these mobile phones.

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000
They were called car phones, not mobile phones.

01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.000
Not even when this was out, I think.

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.000
You had a brick in the car.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000
16 bits and we liked it.

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:30.000
That's right, you had your gaming in 16 or 8 or whatever bits and you liked it that way.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:38.000
It's the classic game of the week where Dark Soccer is going to climb into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, play it.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000
It's a little sticky.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.000
This one, most of you have probably already played.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.000
But if you haven't, you're fucking missing out.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:48.000
It was also hopefully chosen by Rachel.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000
The game is Earthbound.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000
Yeah, I know. I've done Mother before.

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.000
I haven't done Mother 2, so shut up.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000
Don't judge me.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000
This one was...

01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:04.000
I don't think there's very many people that are going to judge you for doing another Mother game.

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
This series is beloved by a lot of people.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Yeah, I need to actually break out my copy and play it.

01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:12.000
Yes, I do have this game.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:16.000
But in Japan, it was Mother 2 Gigu no Gyakushu.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.000
Which, I don't know what Gyakushu means, so somebody translate for me.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:22.000
Oh, I knew that once.

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:24.000
Probably...

01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:26.000
...Gig's Revenge.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.000
Something like that.

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:34.000
At any rate, when it came out with the attract demo, there were two different names.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:38.000
One was Earthbound, the war against Giygas.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000
And the other one was Mother 2.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.000
However they've written it, G-Y-I-Y-G, that's a weird way to spell it.

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.000
Strikes Back.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:52.000
It was designed by Shigesato Itoi.

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:56.000
And it was actually the sequel to Mother.

01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000
I was going to say, he was the last boss in the game.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.000
That's why he's named that.

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:02.000
Okay.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
Well, no, I know that was his name.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000
I didn't know why they spelled it that way.

01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000
Because it's very weird.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:16.000
At any rate, the game was released on August 27th, 1994 in Japan.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.000
And in America as Earthbound on June 5th, 1995.

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.000
As a standalone, as not a sequel to anything.

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000
Because we didn't know.

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:28.000
We had an import back then, huh?

01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:30.000
We had Final Fantasy 6 as Final Fantasy 3.

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.000
Come on.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.000
Yeah.

01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000
And then we had our spoon bards.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:38.000
Yes.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000
In Final Fantasy 2.4.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000
Bouldlerized translations.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000
It's actually evident in a few places in Earthbound.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:52.000
There's a sequence fairly close to the beginning where they replaced a beating sound with a scolding sound.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:56.000
And that's your nemesis, basically.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000
He comes home and he gets his ass whooped by his parents.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Thus launching into the game proper, I think.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:06.000
Well, the game did not sell very well.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:08.000
And it was new.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:16.000
However, everyone loved it because they really liked the satire of American culture.

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:22.000
And the different parodies showing up for the RPG genre.

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:26.000
It's so quintessentially Japanese.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000
There's just something so unique about it.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:32.000
You could not have something like Mr. Saturn in an American game.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:34.000
That's true.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:40.000
I like Mr. Saturn in Smash Brothers because you can hit people with him.

01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.000
Or the cultist. That was my favorite part of the game.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:44.000
Ah, yes.

01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000
This shit was hilarious.

01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000
Or a boss made out of vomit.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.000
I do like running around in your pajamas, but in the original, you were naked.

01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000
Oh, yes.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:31:00.000
It's just such a unique game. That's one of the things that drew me toward it.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:04.000
They had a sequel planned for the Nintendo 64 double D.

01:31:04.000 --> 01:31:06.000
Which was Earthbound 64.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:10.000
And it had been in development for a while before it was cancelled.

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:14.000
And then it came out as a GBA game called Mother 3.

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000
And it only came out in Japan.

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000
However, there are fan translations.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:22.000
They have a very loose connection to Mother 2.

01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000
But you can play it on its own.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000
There's actually a few returning characters.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:32.000
Yes, and you know, playing the prequel to it does make for a much richer experience.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.000
It will punch you in the emotions.

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
I assure you. It'll get you in the feels.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.000
Yes.

01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Now, it actually uses a kind of different sort of projection for playing the game.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:48.000
It uses what's called oblique projection instead of the top down.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:54.000
So that you're sort of skewed on a different level with all of the things around it.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:32:02.000
So it gives the world, even though it is purely 2D, it gives it some sort of...

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:06.000
It really makes it seamless as you go from place to place.

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:08.000
You know, I think Pokemon uses kind of a similar...

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000
Pretty similar, yeah, style.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:16.000
But I really liked its use of the color palette on the SNES.

01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:18.000
Because I thought it was just gorgeous.

01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:20.000
Oh yes, yes.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:22.000
It's not just color, it's how they use it.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:27.000
But it also doesn't use random encounters like the first Mother game did.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000
Oh yeah.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:32.000
And it is not every three steps like the original Mother.

01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.000
Yes.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:38.000
So basically, you beat them down to zero.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.000
For their hit points, they get killed.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:45.000
And if you defeat a specific type of enemy, there's a chance you'll get an item.

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:48.000
Also, my favorite part about it was the rolling counter.

01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:53.000
You could get mortally hit and still finish a fight and live.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:59.000
So if you gave yourself enough time, especially towards the end when you're upwards of 300 life,

01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.000
that was pretty sweet.

01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:07.000
I like how it compares your hit points box to an odometer.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000
Oh yeah.

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:16.000
And then of course you had your psi attacks that used your psychic points.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:19.000
I guess PK fire.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:23.000
I heard that way too many times playing Smash Brothers.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.000
PK fire! PK fire!

01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:27.000
It just never goes away.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:32.000
As far as your weapons go, and yeah, your main character is Ness,

01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:36.000
but different weapons were available such as baseball bats, yo-yos, and frying pans.

01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:40.000
Except for one character named Pooh, who can use a sword.

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.000
But that was only way at the end.

01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:45.000
For most of the game, he's just using his fists.

01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000
And this is like, what, a 12-year-old?

01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:48.000
Yeah.

01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:50.000
Give him props for that.

01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:52.000
Well, when you're fighting, vomit.

01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:58.000
And miniaturized UFOs, wearing bows, and yes, all sorts of critters.

01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000
You had all kinds of neat places in the game too.

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:06.000
You had Onett, you know, Toussaint 3 to 4side, you know.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:07.000
They were named.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:13.000
You also had Winters, Summers, and Dallam, Scaraba, you know,

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
different places that were meant to mimic different areas.

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000
Highly creative names.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:23.000
And then you had to, you know, beat the Star Men and everything.

01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:27.000
What I really like is looking at the concept art for this game.

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.000
Oh, yes.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.000
I don't know if you've ever seen any of the concept art for this.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000
It's quite whimsical, and it's just aching and beautiful.

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000
It makes me think of a child's storybook.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
Oh, yes, especially I...

01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:38.000
This would be a fucked up story.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:42.000
But my favorite was always Dungeon Man, because, you know,

01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:45.000
you could see just this like really whimsical turn to it.

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:48.000
And it's also, there's so much detail in it and so much life.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:50.000
It's like, this is such a life affirming game.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.000
That's one reason I always went back to it.

01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:00.000
There was part of the dialogue for the final battle,

01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.000
and this was actually, I was reading,

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:07.000
is this something that I'd read before about the military policemen

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000
and the dismembered beauty?

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:13.000
Yes, and it's not actually a rape scene, as is often misquoted,

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:16.000
but it's a sex scene which turns into a murder scene,

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:21.000
which, you know, is not really a point for splitting money hairs.

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:26.000
But it's always said that it had such an impact on him

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000
that he incorporated it into the game.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.000
And it works really well.

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.000
It's very disjointed, and it's kind of horrifying,

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.000
because there's just this sense of out-of-place-ness there

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000
that you don't get in many games.

01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000
But I like that when they marketed this in Japan,

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:44.000
they actually used a member of SMOP to advertise the game.

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:48.000
They had scratches of stickers that came out with it.

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:51.000
They did all kinds of stuff with weekly Famitsu

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000
to promote the hell out of this game,

01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:56.000
and of course, sadly, it didn't sell up to expectations.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:01.000
But in America, it sold 140,000 copies and twice that many in Japan,

01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000
which is still not all that great,

01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:06.000
not for how SNES games were selling at the time.

01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:11.000
But, you know, it's like many things that are underappreciated when they're new.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000
They go back and get that cult status.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000
Oh, yes.

01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:19.000
And now, you know, it's just considered one of the top games ever.

01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:22.000
In 2006, there was a poll in Famitsu,

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:25.000
and it was rated the 37th best game of all time out of 100.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:32.000
And it was listed from Gamasutra as one of the top 20 essential Japanese RPGs.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000
I really love this game, for the record,

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000
because, you know, and I remember playing this.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.000
I rented this at least, like, four times from the store and stuff like that,

01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000
just playing the shit out of it.

01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.000
One reason I really liked it is that, you know,

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:47.000
I was really into Final Fantasy and all those games on the Super Nintendo,

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000
and this was very kind of, it was like that,

01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:52.000
but very, like, it wasn't swords and sorcery and stuff.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.000
It was just like kids being stupid.

01:36:54.000 --> 01:36:55.000
And I loved that.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000
Like, it was very cartoonish,

01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:00.000
like the most cartoony thing you could really play on the Super Nintendo at the time,

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.000
but yet it was like this Final Fantasy RPG.

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000
That's what I always really loved about it.

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000
I really should break out my copy again and play it.

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:08.000
Good times.

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:13.000
But, yeah, I actually have, I believe this is one of the ones I have in the box still.

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:16.000
I have to admit, I came into this, you know, afterwards.

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.000
This was not one of the ones we had on the console.

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
I actually completed this on emulator, so, you know,

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.000
sorry if that disqualifies me as a serious gamer, but...

01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.000
I think a lot of people just kind of discovered it that way.

01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:29.000
It's really hard to find it for less than 60 bucks.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.000
Yes, yes.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.000
But, you know, at the same time,

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:37.000
I feel, you know, kind of glad that it's, you know, found such popularity on an emulator,

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000
because it has reached a much wider audience,

01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:44.000
and it does make for a richer experience that you can get it out to different people,

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:48.000
and you find all these little secrets and things you hadn't seen before.

01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:50.000
Did you see the embryos?

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.000
You know...

01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:52.000
In the very last stage?

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.000
I've seen that, yeah, but you know what?

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000
I don't think that is intentional.

01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000
Like, I don't think that's an intentional design thing.

01:37:57.000 --> 01:38:02.000
That's a bit like, you know, the backwards tribute to Satan in the Led Zeppelin song.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.000
It's not...

01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:09.000
Yeah, but I could, but given E-toys history, maybe I could see it happening.

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:12.000
I just don't know how you didn't actually get that,

01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000
because it's not just one static image.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.000
It's sort of a rolling thing.

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:18.000
But it's a repeating. It's a tile.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.000
But it's like, it's moving.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.000
So I don't...

01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000
I don't know.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:28.000
I mean, at any rate, for other things that have happened with the series,

01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:32.000
of course, it...

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:38.000
Definitely Ness and other characters have shown up in the Super Smash Bros. series,

01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.000
and...

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:43.000
Well, Ness was a hidden character, but everyone freaking used him.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:47.000
And Onett was actually a stage in Brawl,

01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:51.000
and New Pork City in Mother 3 showed up in Brawl as well,

01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:54.000
to the rejoice of all who wanted to see it in 3D.

01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.000
Yes.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:59.000
There were also trophies for Paula, Jeff, and Pooh.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:03.000
And Jeff is an assist trophy in Super Smash Bros. Brawl.

01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:09.000
And his multi-bottle rockets were involved as well.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:13.000
And Mr. Saturn, you could throw him at people, because that was awesome.

01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:16.000
Why was... Mr. Saturn should have been our Pikachu.

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:19.000
Mr. Saturn, however, you got special...

01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:22.000
It was like, you got an achievement for Mr. Saturn-love,

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:24.000
or you got points for it,

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:27.000
when you let him wander around the screen and didn't throw him at people.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000
I always thought it was funny.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000
And Mr. Saturn only wants to help.

01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000
You can't help it that he's just a butt on legs.

01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:34.000
With Bo.

01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000
Well, at any rate, like I said earlier,

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:42.000
there was supposed to be a sequel in 96 on the 64DD,

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:45.000
but it kept having production problems,

01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:48.000
and didn't show at E3 and other gaming conventions.

01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:51.000
So Nintendo cancelled it on August 21st, 2000,

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:54.000
but it resurfaced as a GBA title,

01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:56.000
and it was only released in Japan.

01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:01.000
And also Itoi said he had no more plans to develop the series any further.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:06.000
There was an ESRB rating that said that it might come out on Wii,

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000
but there are still no official plans.

01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:13.000
And I want to give further props to the fan translation community,

01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:17.000
because in their fight to translate this,

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:21.000
they also found a lot of cool, unused things.

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:24.000
Just sort of artifacts that were left in the data.

01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:25.000
Vomit?

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000
Yes. Well, unfortunately, no.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:31.000
Just things that, you know, unused bosses and unused sprites,

01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:36.000
they make you wonder at what was originally planned for this,

01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:40.000
because there were a few places that the creator said

01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:43.000
he actually had to scale it back a bit because it was frightening him.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:47.000
I'm, of course, referring to the extended mushroom trip,

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000
like sort of halfway through the game.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:52.000
I actually need to sit down and play E3,

01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.000
because I just haven't had time.

01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:56.000
Well, there's an extended mushroom trip.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.000
And the final boss.

01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:58.000
I like extended mushroom trips.

01:40:58.000 --> 01:41:01.000
The final boss, there is an unused boss battle,

01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:04.000
which is, I think it's available on YouTube,

01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:10.000
which is deeply unsettling, despite my lack of understanding Japanese.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:15.000
But as it stands, the Mother 3 game is a very emotionally engaging

01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000
and rich game, I find.

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:24.000
And it's got its predecessor's balance of horror and just awesomeness.

01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Well, this also, I think, is kind of cool.

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:31.000
The sound designer for Earthbound, Keiichi Suzuki,

01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:35.000
he actually said that the biggest influence for the music for him

01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000
was John Lennon.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:38.000
Excellent.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000
You know, in the YouTube we're watching here,

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000
I just saw a reference to the Beatles,

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000
and it's like one of those funny little jokes, like,

01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:47.000
do you know the name of this Beatles song?

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000
Blank Blank Blank Turday.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000
And the options are yes and no.

01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:54.000
Like, it's a funny joke because you can say yes.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000
You're right, it's yesterday.

01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:57.000
Anyway.

01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000
And, you know, music references, sadly,

01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:03.000
are one of the reasons they'd have trouble releasing Mother 3 in the U.S.

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:08.000
Because there is the Runaway 5 in Earthbound.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:11.000
It was actually originally kind of a Blues Brother-y tribute,

01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:14.000
which it's kind of evident in the finished product of the game.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:18.000
But I can't remember, it's the DMC or something like that?

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.000
There's Pinball. I just saw Pinball.

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.000
I forgot there was Pinball in the arcade.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.000
Sweet.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:30.000
But there's also the band in Mother 3 is also kind of clearly ripped off another band.

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.000
Escapes me.

01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:34.000
Well, that's the game.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:40.000
Mother 2 slash Earthbound with strong hints towards Mother 3.

01:42:40.000 --> 01:42:42.000
All right, there it is, your classic game of the week.

01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:44.000
Earthbound, Mother 2.

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:47.000
And a little dash of Mother 3, but we have to save that for another week.

01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:50.000
We should do a Gaiden version called Daddy.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:53.000
Anyhow, that's going to do it for Part A, but don't go anywhere.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.000
We have plenty more to come.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.000
We may not have a whole lot of news, but we do have the rapid-fire news.

01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000
We have your Fugu question of the week coming up as well.

01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:04.000
Mailbag and Match Game coming back tonight in Part B.

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:05.000
Don't go anywhere, guys.

01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:08.000
We'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:17.000
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:23.000
Live here on November the 25th of 2012 with the 483rd episode of our show.

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:26.000
It's a little bit of a slower news week this week,

01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:28.000
but that's all right.

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:30.000
We still have some news stories to talk about,

01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:33.000
including the rapid-fire news, which is coming up right now.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:34.000
Loki.

01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:35.000
Yes.

01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:40.000
So let's talk about my favorite gaming series, Grand Theft Auto.

01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:45.000
Grand Theft Auto had a wonderful release on iOS and Android of Grand Theft Auto 3,

01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:49.000
celebrating the 10th anniversary earlier this year, maybe even last year.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:50.000
I can't remember.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:54.000
But soon enough, you'll be able to get some more Grand Theft Auto love

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:58.000
on your portable devices with Grand Theft Auto Vice City,

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:02.000
the HD treatment for the 10th anniversary of that game as well.

01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:07.000
So I'm hoping that San Andreas is only a couple more years away.

01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:11.000
And that'll be available on December 6th,

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:17.000
and apparently it's going to cost you $5 on both Android or iOS.

01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:21.000
That's fantastic.

01:44:21.000 --> 01:44:23.000
I cannot wait.

01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:27.000
Except I can, because I'm not actually going to play it on the phone,

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:30.000
because gaming on the phone sucks.

01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:32.000
And then to kind of go along with that,

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:40.000
there's kind of a fan campaign to try to get Grand Theft Auto 5 onto PC and the Wii U.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:45.000
And of course, developers are like, well, anything is up for consideration.

01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:47.000
And of course, they haven't announced anything.

01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:54.000
Right now, they're mainly focused on getting the game out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:57.000
It's hard to say if there's actually going to be a PC version for the game.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:01.000
The scene is that there wasn't one for Red Dead Redemption,

01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:03.000
although there was one for L.A. Noire.

01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000
So I don't know.

01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:08.000
It'd be kind of cool if it was on PC, because that game looks fantastic.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.000
I don't know.

01:45:11.000 --> 01:45:14.000
I may need to get a new PC for that if they do end up getting one.

01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:19.000
And then also, of course, Reggie threw in his two cents saying,

01:45:19.000 --> 01:45:22.000
yeah, we'd totally love Grand Theft Auto 5 on the Wii U.

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:25.000
Yes, that would probably be a nice system selling game now, wouldn't it?

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:28.000
Except right now, it's still up in the air.

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:32.000
And last but not least, I'm not sure this should make you angry or excited,

01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:34.000
the fact that this is coming out over here.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:42.000
The Bayonetta DLC that was available in Japan is coming to North America.

01:45:42.000 --> 01:45:46.000
However, it's coming to North America as a GameStop exclusive.

01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:50.000
And I guess it will be kind of a day one limited edition.

01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:57.000
Also in Europe, the U.S., you're going to have to wait until it comes out in January.

01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:03.000
And if you really want that DLC, you're going to have to wait and purchase it from GameStop.

01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.000
And the game is supposed to be a lot cheaper.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:09.000
It's only $29.99 as opposed to a full-price game.

01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:15.000
It is kind of disappointing, though, that GameStop locked in the DLC for that.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:17.000
I hate that. Whatever.

01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:19.000
I mean, you never know. That stuff could come out later on.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:20.000
They could sell it later.

01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:27.000
But just throwing GameStop alone, I guess, and giving them exclusive DLC.

01:46:27.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Not going to hold my breath.

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:32.000
All right. Well, moving on.

01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.000
This is pretty good.

01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:35.000
I mean, I know we've talked about some Vita hardships,

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:37.000
but there's a lot of good stuff to talk about on Vita right now,

01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:40.000
not just the free games, but price reductions.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:45.000
November 27th is going to see some price reductions on the PlayStation Network for the download.

01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:48.000
You know, if you have a memory card large enough to hold some games,

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:51.000
you can get some games for a lot cheaper than they used to be.

01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:57.000
For $17.99, Hot Shots Golf, Little Deviants, MLB 12 The Show, ModNation Racers,

01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:00.000
Reality Fighters, and Wipeout 2048.

01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:05.000
$26.99, Resistance Burning Skies, Smart As, not to be confused with Smart As,

01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:09.000
and Unit 13, and then $35.99 for Uncharted Golden Abyss,

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:13.000
but as mentioned before, you could get that free with PlayStation Plus.

01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:15.000
You would just have to kind of juggle, like, you know,

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:19.000
remember when you are on PlayStation Plus, if you let your account lapse,

01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:20.000
you'll lose all those free games.

01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:24.000
So you kind of have to weigh, is that something I really want to be locked into?

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:26.000
I don't mind it, personally, because I don't, you know,

01:47:26.000 --> 01:47:28.000
the games I'm getting for free aren't things that, like,

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:32.000
if I really want a game bad enough that I can revisit whenever, I'll buy it.

01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:37.000
But I like that PlayStation Plus kind of allows me to play games I might have missed from a couple years ago.

01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:40.000
So, I don't know, I don't want to sound like a mouthpiece for Sony,

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:45.000
but I'm glad to see that they're reducing the price of some of these games.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:48.000
Might be what the system needs right now.

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:51.000
Darkstalker Resurrection, some folks looking forward to this.

01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:56.000
This is the Darkstalker games for Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:57.000
Happy, happy, happy.

01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:58.000
This is that collection.

01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Yep, there's also going to be a new tournament, an online tournament mode coming in the game.

01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000
This is according to Capcom Unity.

01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:06.000
The online mode is going to support eight players.

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:09.000
Sudden Death, One Takes All, Best of Two or Best of Three.

01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:14.000
Resurrection will also include the usual ranked and player matches.

01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:17.000
Resurrection, of course, being the name of this download game.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:19.000
Pretty cool there.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:24.000
And you can do replays on YouTube, so can't wait for YouTube to get flooded with this stuff.

01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:25.000
So that's pretty cool.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:31.000
14.99 on PlayStation Network, 1200 Microsoft points on Xbox Live Arcade when it comes out in 2013.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:36.000
If you're a fan of Half-Minute Hero, maybe you're wondering when are we getting Half-Minute Hero 2.

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:42.000
Well, Marvelous producer Esteban Salazar told Siliconera that,

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:45.000
quote, it's considerably more expensive to put out the sequel,

01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:50.000
and they need to sell a lot more of the first game on PC to begin to justify it.

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:53.000
If this is something you're interested in, you might want to, quote,

01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:57.000
encourage your friends to buy the Steam version or buy it for them.

01:48:57.000 --> 01:49:00.000
P.S., the game's 40% off on Steam right now.

01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.000
Actually, that wasn't in the quote, but that sure seemed to be convenient.

01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:09.000
So, yep, you want Half-Minute Hero 2, buy part one for friends.

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:12.000
Half-Minute Hero was kind of fun.

01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:14.000
I mean, I'm not going to cry if the sequel never comes out,

01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:18.000
but I'm surprised it didn't sell enough to necessitate the sequel.

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:19.000
Dark Sakura.

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Stuff happened. The end. No, I'm kidding.

01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:31.000
For fans of the AM2 games, they are going to be out on Xbox Live Arcade

01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:33.000
and PlayStation Network during the week.

01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:37.000
We have Fighting Vipers, Sonic the Fighters, which I'm more excited about,

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:40.000
and Virtua Fighter 2, which I could give less than a crap about,

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:44.000
but I'm usually very alone in that.

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.000
The games are going to have their own achievements and trophies

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:49.000
and will support online multiplayer.

01:49:49.000 --> 01:50:00.000
They will be about five bucks each and about 4.49 euro in Europe.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:07.000
So they'll be out on November 27th in North America and December 5th in Europe.

01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:11.000
Man, I have Fighters Megamix at home,

01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:17.000
and I wish that they would update Fighters Megamix. Wouldn't that be awesome?

01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:22.000
So anyway, Capcom's also getting back into more fighting game stuff.

01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:25.000
They've registered the name Fighters of Capcom.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:31.000
It's a trademark, actually, and they haven't really said what it's about,

01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:36.000
but maybe it'll be good. Hopefully.

01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:40.000
And moving forward, on the Korean ratings board,

01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:47.000
Resident Evil Revelations has been listed for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3,

01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:52.000
so that means we might actually be getting the version out for the bigger consoles.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:55.000
Who knows? And that is that.

01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:59.000
All right. Let's take a trip over to Facebook and Google Plus,

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:02.000
and when you slam those words together, you get Boogle.

01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:11.000
The Foogle Question of the Week.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:15.000
We ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities and look for some answers.

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:20.000
And of course, it's got to be about the Wii U again this week, but with good reason.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:24.000
This is about kind of how we're feeling post launch of the Wii U.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:27.000
Here's the question from our Facebook community at facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio

01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:30.000
and our Google Plus community. Search for Orange Launch Radio.

01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:33.000
Now that the console has been out for a week,

01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:38.000
have you found that your opinion has changed on the Wii U from the pre-release hype?

01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:43.000
Perhaps you weren't so excited about it before, but you ended up buying one for a reason,

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:47.000
or you were really excited after E3, but found that maybe you'll hold off for a while.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:50.000
Why did or didn't your opinion change?

01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:53.000
Let's go to some comments first off from Facebook.

01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:57.000
Wicked said, originally I wasn't too keen on the Wii U.

01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:02.000
It seemed like it was coming out too early for it to be a next-gen console,

01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:05.000
especially since the graphics wasn't much better than what was out now.

01:52:05.000 --> 01:52:10.000
Also, sequelizing a console the way they did, essentially requiring the Wii to fully utilize the Wii U's potential,

01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.000
seemed like a cop-out.

01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:14.000
Wow, I was wrong.

01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:20.000
The graphics are definitely top notch, and the Wii's usual stigma of waggle wand was significantly downplayed.

01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:25.000
The games are amazing, especially Zombie U and Nintendo Land, which could easily be the party game of the year.

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:29.000
As lukewarm as I was for the Wii U, I must say, after having it in my hands,

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:34.000
which the tablet controller feels perfectly fine in, I am definitely on the bandwagon now.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:40.000
Virtual Phil said, I was excited for it, but also a bit meh regarding the annoying hype.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:45.000
However, now that I've played the console, and have had a ton of fun with Nintendo Land's multiplayer games,

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:50.000
I'm loving it. I just wish the catalog of games was bigger from the outset.

01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:56.000
Dark Charger said, Nintendo continues to struggle with online, and despite a good number of launch titles,

01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:59.000
there is really nothing worth buying the system for, yet.

01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:04.000
Eventually there will hopefully be an F-Zero, Earthbound, yeah right, Metroid, or even better yet,

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:06.000
some new IPs that will make me want to pick it up.

01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:11.000
Playing yesterday's games that I can already play on my PS3 or 360 isn't going to do it.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:17.000
Doug T said, I'm holding off on buying the Wii U. I'm waiting for more high quality first party games.

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:23.000
I have a PS3, which is my favorite console, so when games are released on all three consoles, I will buy it for my PS3.

01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:28.000
Also, I was disappointed with my Wii, so I'm waiting to see how the Wii U does over time.

01:53:28.000 --> 01:53:34.000
AZHP said, before the console launched, I was really hopeful that Nintendo had figured out online.

01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:37.000
Pause for Loki to scoff.

01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:42.000
They figured out that it's there. How to use it, maybe.

01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:47.000
Now that I'm hearing reports of how purchases are tied to the console instead of the Wii profile,

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:52.000
that there are separate wallets for Wii and Wii U online purchases that are on the same console,

01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:56.000
and that profiles can't be transferred between consoles, I'm just disappointed in Nintendo.

01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:02.000
The 360 did online right, and they did it seven years ago. Shame on Nintendo.

01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:06.000
This answer is a little lengthy from dinner at Johnny's, so I'm not going to read the whole thing,

01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:12.000
but basically said, you know, when Reggie said that they're going to cater to hardcore gamers, he was very excited.

01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:20.000
Now that it's launched, my anticipation dropped considerably, partially because the console lacks focus on an achievement and trophy system.

01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:23.000
Nintendo did this for the benefit of the developers.

01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:29.000
And he kind of goes on to talk about how it's like a standard thing now, how Blizzard and all this does this.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:32.000
I'm kind of disappointed they missed the boat on that, too.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:38.000
Especially because, you know, on the 3DS, they have the whole accomplishments thing in the plaza.

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.000
I thought they were going this direction.

01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:43.000
You know, it's... Oops.

01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:47.000
We're not ready for the mailbag yet. Be quiet, music.

01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:50.000
Sorry about that. Live radio, it's fun.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:56.000
So, yeah, I, you know, I don't think it's like a deal breaker for the system.

01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:01.000
It's disappointing, but what do you want to bet it's one of those things that just suddenly shows up later?

01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:03.000
Let's see.

01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:08.000
I'm looking at some of the comments in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:13.000
BlackWolf said, to be fair, Nintendo said that you'll be able to transfer profiles yourself soon.

01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:16.000
And that they can already transfer them if you call them.

01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:22.000
But yes, it's not there on launch day, because obviously we all bought multiple Wii U's and really want to be able to transfer our profiles in the first week.

01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:29.000
BlackWolf, again, it's the hole they're building it as they go along, and how obvious is it?

01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:34.000
I mean, I get it. You're right. It's not like we all have multiple Wii U's right now.

01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:39.000
But, I mean, you know, people still make their decisions. Anyway.

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:42.000
Pete Garuno says, I was cautiously optimistic when it was announced.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:46.000
Indifferent when more details emerged, but then I tried a demo unit and could see the potential.

01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:55.000
One of my friends bought it on launch, and seeing that the social aspects of sending picture messages, asking other players for help on a specific point is kind of selling it for me.

01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:02.000
Can't really justify the purchase at the moment, though, so it's currently on my wait for a major price reduction pile.

01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:09.000
Let's see, going to Code Man. I haven't bought one yet, but I've played with one here, and they're at different electronic stores.

01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:14.000
I have to say that the tech is pretty cool, and being a designer, the interface is well done as well.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:20.000
What's keeping me from buying it, though, is I don't believe Nintendo is done with it, and tried to rush it out before the holiday season.

01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:24.000
So until everything is working correctly, I would love to get my hands on one.

01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:28.000
The only flaw in your logic I see is that, again, it's about the games.

01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:34.000
It's not necessarily about the hardware, or even the firmware that's on said hardware.

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:41.000
I mean, if they're writing that as they go along, it's weird, but it's not really a deal breaker if Mario HD is still going to be Mario HD at the end of the day.

01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.000
Think about that. That's all I'm saying.

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:49.000
But I can see what he's saying, though, because if you look at the Wii, remember the Wii came out, and then they're all,

01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:53.000
Oh, MotionPlus, because we really wanted these controllers more sensitive.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:56.000
So now we have Wii MotionPlus, and oh, you bought MotionPlus.

01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:00.000
You know what? Now we have this fancy controller that already has it incorporated into it.

01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:07.000
Yay. Oh, wait, now we need this other controller to do something, and you need that for this game.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:13.000
That's fair. I understand that. The whole Wii MotionPlus, or the Vitality Sensor.

01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:15.000
Ooh. LOL.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000
Okay, Google Plus time.

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Evil says, hype level has generally been the same.

01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:23.000
Actually, it's E3VL, but it says evil to me.

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000
Hype level has been generally the same.

01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:28.000
Nintendo's consoles will always be my go-to for first-party content.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:34.000
My only concern is that if the Wii U will be my main console after Microsoft and Sony releases their next system,

01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:37.000
seeing if Nintendo is consistent with quality of third-party ports.

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.000
Retertainment says my opinion has not changed.

01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:43.000
I still have priorities that are higher on my list than buying a Wii U.

01:57:43.000 --> 01:57:46.000
Not that I think a Wii U would be good buy or a bad buy.

01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:48.000
I'd just rather save for a house right now.

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.000
I don't think I'm alone in this opinion.

01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:52.000
Priorities are important. I'll give you that.

01:57:52.000 --> 01:57:57.000
Rabababa says, now that I've played it a few days, the pad is better than expected.

01:57:57.000 --> 01:58:01.000
It can do a lot of unique things. Best of all, it can look up hints on the internet without an extra device.

01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:04.000
Very few games take advantage of it.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:08.000
Flaco Jones says, I got a chance to play it for a few hours, and my opinion hasn't changed much.

01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:11.000
I still think it's way overpriced when comparing it to the competition,

01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:16.000
and the controller didn't sway me with the small selection of games that utilize it halfway decently.

01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:19.000
Better games would definitely be the best way to change my mind.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:25.000
Sean F. replied and said, I was never really excited. My PS3 and PSP are enough for me.

01:58:25.000 --> 01:58:29.000
And Nick M. said, yeah, it went from being a polished, well-presented turd

01:58:29.000 --> 01:58:32.000
to just a turd that sits in the corner of my living room.

01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000
So you bought one?

01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:38.000
I'd be curious to hear more about you bought one and it's sitting in your living room unused.

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:42.000
I want to hear more about that. Please elaborate for later.

01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:45.000
And I want to hear about your collection of polished turds. No, I'm kidding.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:51.000
But I haven't heard of anybody who's bought one that said, yeah, it's already collecting dust in the corner.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:55.000
I'm very curious to explore that further, so please send an email or something.

01:58:55.000 --> 01:59:00.000
It's very possible it collected fingerprints because I'm sure it can collect fingerprints quite well.

01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:03.000
Yeah, it does. Especially the black ones.

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:06.000
Alright, I read all the comments tonight because I'm nice.

01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:10.000
Code Man is in chat, by the way, saying, to kind of clarify the comment,

01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:13.000
I really want to check out Zombie You. And I do agree it's about the games, Rob,

01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:17.000
but I do think they should get the console into control before a good title can be released.

01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:21.000
In light of what Loki said, I get a little more what you're saying now.

01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:26.000
Alright, couple stories for you guys and then we're going to get to the match game. Yay!

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:31.000
Alright, so we had a little bit of a comment before about talking about console generations

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:35.000
and kind of how they want things to change.

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:39.000
Well, THQ kind of got themselves into a little, well, it's not even really THQ,

01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:46.000
but like the publisher, 4A, and I guess one of the THQ PR guys,

01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:52.000
they've been trying to cover up, cover up I guess, defuse a situation that happened on Twitter.

01:59:52.000 --> 01:59:56.000
I think it was on Twitter. Anyways, during an interview,

01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:03.000
It's always Twitter. Take away people's PR people and like they say the dumbest shit.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:06.000
That's why Twitter is great. Honestly.

02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:14.000
So I think at least part of it took place on Twitter. It's basically talking about how the Wii U's CPU is slow.

02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:19.000
And the quote is actually, the Wii U has a horrible, slow CPU.

02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:23.000
And that's why they're saying that Metro Last Light is not going to be ported to the Wii U

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:30.000
is because the game system has a slow CPU and that it would just be impossible.

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:37.000
So, of course, THQ doesn't want to have this whole stigma of,

02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:43.000
Oh, yeah, we just totally dogged in that system, but we want to put some games out on it.

02:00:43.000 --> 02:00:48.000
And have Nintendo go, yeah, fuck you guys. You're not going on our system.

02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:51.000
But if you think about it, THQ doesn't have a whole ton of,

02:00:51.000 --> 02:00:55.000
I mean, they have a few games, I guess, that were launched. There was Darksiders 2.

02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:04.000
And it's not out yet, but they've got Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy that they're porting over to that.

02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:09.000
Not necessarily CPU intensive games. I mean, Darksiders may be a little bit, but you know,

02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:12.000
Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune, not quite so much.

02:01:13.000 --> 02:01:19.000
So, I don't know. It's interesting, though, they have basically the developer saying one thing

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:25.000
and then THQ is kind of like saying, Oh, well, it's not necessarily what they meant.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:28.000
They're just saying that, oh, it's a very CPU intensive game.

02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:36.000
And, you know, that, I don't know, maybe that this, you know, we use CPU wouldn't be able to handle this or something.

02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:40.000
And then there's some other developers saying, well, you know, sounds like, you know,

02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:44.000
they just couldn't even bother, you know, trying to port the game, you know, port over,

02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:50.000
because it does have a faster GPU and a lot more RAM than the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360.

02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:57.000
And of course, you know, it's this Gustav Halling saying, you know, yeah, you know, GPU and RAM's nice.

02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:00.000
They have shaders and textures loaded, but physics and gameplay are on CPU.

02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:04.000
So, I don't know. Will that be a problem? Possibly.

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:10.000
I don't know. It'd be interesting to see if we get, you know, if Grand Theft Auto 5 doesn't come to the Wii U

02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:16.000
because it's got a slow CPU and can't load, you know, can't load the world fast enough or something like that.

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:20.000
Tigerclaw with a fair thought in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:24.000
Maybe the Wii U having a better GPU and a slow CPU is a tradeoff.

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:30.000
Nintendo wanted a system with really great graphics, but had to sacrifice CPU in order to bring the cost of the system down,

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:34.000
which is why some games like Arkham City have frame rate drops.

02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:41.000
That's not good. I mean, I understand that you, if you're going to make sacrifices and you're not ready,

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:45.000
then you need to wait until that tech comes down in price.

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:49.000
You know, maybe when the console will be more finished, but that's going to be a problem

02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:54.000
because if you're not willing to put the technology into it, you're going to have these next-gen systems come out

02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000
and they're just going to run circles around you.

02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:59.000
Yeah. And I, you know, the frame rate drop in Arkham City,

02:02:59.000 --> 02:03:03.000
I'm chalking that up to the fact that it's a port of a game that wasn't designed for the console.

02:03:03.000 --> 02:03:06.000
I'm really curious what 2013's games are going to look like.

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000
That's really what's going to define the Wii U, honestly.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000
And I'm sure the first-party games will look nice.

02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000
That's what they always kind of base their sales off of.

02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:13.000
That's what always happens with Nintendo.

02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:17.000
So, I mean, that'll look nice because they're developing for the system,

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:21.000
but you're going to have to wonder with some of these game systems that are already out there now

02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:24.000
and you're going to have a Wii U version coming out at the same time.

02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:30.000
And honestly, it's just, for me, it seems like it's like, okay, Nintendo told these publishers,

02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:34.000
hey, by the way, you've got to have this gimmick that's thrown in there.

02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:41.000
Like, for example, NBA 2K13, you can hold up the Wii U's game pad to see which of your, you know,

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:47.000
athletes or whatever are tired, which is funny because you can do the same thing on any of the other consoles

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:51.000
by pressing start and that same information comes up there.

02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:55.000
It's like, it's not necessary to have that.

02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:59.000
It's kind of the same thing that you have with some of these games that support Kinect,

02:03:59.000 --> 02:04:03.000
where you have voice commands to do shit that you can do with the button press.

02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:08.000
It's just, it's there to use the hardware so they can say, hey, we've got, you know,

02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:14.000
this game that supports these extra features or whatever, but really these features aren't needed for this gameplay.

02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000
It's not adding anything really new.

02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:19.000
And you're going to see a lot of this, I think, with the Wii U

02:04:19.000 --> 02:04:24.000
because you saw a lot of this with the DS and the 3DS is that they don't know how to use this extra screen.

02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:28.000
So you're going to have the stuff that was originally in the start menu on the other screen.

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:31.000
And yeah, it's cool that you don't have to stop gameplay,

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:38.000
but you're still going to have to take your eyes off the screen to fiddle with your inventory or something like that.

02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:43.000
That, you know, pushing start and pausing the game so you have time to do that

02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:48.000
might not be a bad thing instead of getting killed by something while you're having to look off screen.

02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:53.000
Going to our chat room with some comments at live.vognetwork.com.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:56.000
Rama says, I'm waiting for Mario Kart and Bayonetta 2.

02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:59.000
And Dungeon Buster says, I'm mostly waiting on Bayonetta 2.

02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:04.000
Rama says, by the way, I feel bad for people eBaying Wii U's. It's pointless.

02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:07.000
Don't feel bad for them. Point and laugh at them.

02:05:07.000 --> 02:05:10.000
I think it's hilarious that that whole scheme is backfiring

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:15.000
because those people that are buying consoles just to flip them and take them away from somebody who might really want them,

02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:17.000
fuck them. I hope they lose a lot of money.

02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:21.000
I hope they get stuck with all those Twinkies too and have to eat them.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:24.000
So you know what? I feel no sympathy for them.

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:28.000
Unless it was like legitimately bought and maybe being flipped around

02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:32.000
because a person decided, well, I don't want this polished turd sitting in the corner of my room anymore.

02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:35.000
That's different, like a used Wii U already or whatever.

02:05:35.000 --> 02:05:40.000
But like somebody who bought it just to try and flip it for an increased cost, middle finger to you.

02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000
I don't care that you're out $400.

02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:45.000
They'll take them back to the store and get their money back, which is also bullshit.

02:05:45.000 --> 02:05:47.000
But, you know, it is what it is.

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:50.000
Anyhow, piggybacking on this a little bit.

02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:55.000
There's a piece in the New York Times that is kind of a, like, it's in the New York Times.

02:05:55.000 --> 02:06:01.000
It's not really an opinion article, but it certainly kind of looks at, did Nintendo do the right thing?

02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:03.000
Is the Wii U a good system?

02:06:03.000 --> 02:06:09.000
And they go to a familiar name for a quote, which, you know, this little quote from the New York Times article is making its way around the game blogs.

02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:12.000
And the quote is from Nolan Bushnell.

02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:13.000
You recognize that name?

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:14.000
Yep.

02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.000
Yeah, what did he do, Jamie?

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:18.000
Um, Chuck E. Cheese.

02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:20.000
Yes, and Pong. Pong, too.

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:21.000
Yes.

02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:22.000
Yes, and Chuck E. Cheese. That's important, too.

02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:27.000
Well, quote, I am actually, I actually am baffled by it.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:30.000
I don't think it's going to be a big success.

02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000
That's the quote.

02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000
Let's see, what else did he say here?

02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:40.000
Quote, these things will continue to sputter along, but I really don't think they'll be of major import ever again.

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000
It feels like the end of an era to me.

02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:48.000
And, of course, that has all the game blogs going, Nolan Bushnell thinks the Wii U is an end of an era, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:59.000
And the, it's important to note that this article also kind of takes the stance of, that mobile, it's another one of those pieces that say mobile gaming's going to kill it all.

02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:02.000
And, you know, Nintendo's just trying to get into tablet gaming with this.

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:09.000
And so, I don't know how I feel about all this, but it is interesting that Nolan Bushnell kind of throws his two cents out there.

02:07:09.000 --> 02:07:16.000
Granted, it's one small quote out of what I hope was a larger interview, but is it the end of an era?

02:07:16.000 --> 02:07:20.000
Is the Wii U the swan song of console gaming as we know it?

02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:21.000
No.

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:22.000
I hardly think so.

02:07:22.000 --> 02:07:23.000
No.

02:07:24.000 --> 02:07:32.000
It's just stupid, I mean, because you're just, once again, you're kind of assuming that everyone's going to buy into it or not going to buy into it and go,

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.000
Oh, no, what am I going to game on now?

02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:39.000
I just don't understand, like, why everyone thinks if these next-gen consoles fail that the whole industry's going to fail.

02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:41.000
Hey, you have some consoles that still work.

02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:43.000
You know what happens if a console fails?

02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:46.000
Guess what, they just make games for other consoles.

02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:47.000
It's just like the Vita.

02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:51.000
If the Vita fails, guess what, they'll just make games for the 3DS and the DS.

02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:56.000
Black Wolf kind of puts Nolan's words in another light here, saying,

02:07:56.000 --> 02:07:59.000
No more TV gaming all going handheld mobile now.

02:07:59.000 --> 02:08:01.000
That's what Nolan thinks.

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:04.000
More people play mobile games than ever played console games.

02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:11.000
So maybe he's thinking, maybe Nolan is going this way because of the Wii U invoking the tablet thing,

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.000
kind of trying to get that piece of mobile game.

02:08:13.000 --> 02:08:18.000
But for me, the part that people miss when they jump to that conclusion is that they're not putting,

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:22.000
I mean, the Wii U kind of can't do those same tablet games.

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:26.000
It really is a second screen that does have limited touch controls.

02:08:26.000 --> 02:08:28.000
It just means you can play while you pee.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:30.000
Partially.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:33.000
Well, I told you about that shirt that I saw.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.000
My iPhone has changed the way I go to the bathroom.

02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:36.000
Right.

02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:37.000
Well, I mean, think about it.

02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:39.000
It's gaming anywhere that you want to.

02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:43.000
And there's an attraction there, but I mean, I don't think it's the end of an era.

02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:47.000
It's just an evolution of access.

02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:48.000
Yeah.

02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:51.000
There's only so much of, like, Cut the Rope and Angry Birds I can tolerate.

02:08:51.000 --> 02:08:54.000
And those aren't the games I want to play when I'm sitting on my couch.

02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:59.000
I guarantee there's going to be DS virtual console games by next year.

02:08:59.000 --> 02:09:00.000
Oh.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:03.000
Oh, with the whole, yeah, because since there is second screen anyway.

02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:05.000
The screen is set up exactly like a DS.

02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:06.000
Why not?

02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:13.000
I think clearly it all indicates a return to animatronic restaurants.

02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:17.000
Blackwill following up saying, well, what he's saying is that the new console isn't selling out.

02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:20.000
So people have stopped buying new game consoles.

02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:21.000
I think it is actually selling out.

02:09:21.000 --> 02:09:23.000
It's just that they're replenishing a lot faster.

02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:28.000
And Nintendo's also not advertising it because maybe, you know, and there's a lot of theories behind that.

02:09:28.000 --> 02:09:32.000
But, you know, maybe to their benefit, they know they're going to be limited.

02:09:32.000 --> 02:09:35.000
So why, I mean, the people that want to buy them already know about it.

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:37.000
So why have that advertising push behind it?

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:44.000
Let that grow a little more organically and then do the big advertising push in January, February when you need it.

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:45.000
Spend your gift card on a Wii U.

02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:47.000
You know, that stuff.

02:09:50.000 --> 02:09:54.000
Blackwolf continuing on trying to push the points here.

02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:59.000
But Cut the Rope and Angry Birds are the games that majority of game buyers want to play.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:01.000
We're the minority now.

02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:13.000
Yes and no to me because I feel like the majority audience that's buying Cut the Rope and Angry Birds is an audience that didn't exist before.

02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:18.000
Did people really switch from console gaming to exclusive mobile gaming?

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:21.000
I don't really think that's what happened.

02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:27.000
Yeah, people into Angry Birds are, you know, people like my aunt who is well into her 60s.

02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:31.000
And it's, you know, you're basically not your average gamer.

02:10:31.000 --> 02:10:35.000
It's people getting into it who have never gotten into gaming before.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:39.000
So, yeah, I can understand that, okay, that's where a lot of money is at and so forth.

02:10:39.000 --> 02:10:48.000
But the console industry has been afloat for the years since 1978 with, say, the video game crash of 83, 84.

02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:51.000
The video game industry has been afloat without that audience.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:55.000
So, I don't know. Anyhow.

02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:58.000
Alright, let's move on.

02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:03.000
Bojikawa wants to say, I keep hearing that the Wii U hasn't been advertised.

02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:05.000
I don't watch TV but I do watch Hulu.

02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:09.000
I've seen the commercial for the Wii U many a times there the last couple of weeks.

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:12.000
It's also your audience is most likely to be aware of things like that.

02:11:12.000 --> 02:11:15.000
Like that's still targeting like your tech crowd.

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:20.000
There's a big difference between running Wii U commercials there and running Wii U commercials on Saturday morning cartoons.

02:11:20.000 --> 02:11:22.000
But anyway, I digress.

02:11:22.000 --> 02:11:24.000
Let's play some match game.

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.000
We need to do match game.

02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:29.000
We haven't done match game in forever on this show.

02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:37.000
Alright, if you want to play match game in our chat room, let's see.

02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:46.000
If you want to play match game, then type the name of the second town in Earthbound, our classic game of the week tonight.

02:11:46.000 --> 02:11:48.000
It's really easy, you guys. It's really easy.

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:51.000
Type the name of that in the chat. We'll pick one player at random.

02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:54.000
We'll also open the Skype line in just a minute.

02:11:54.000 --> 02:11:57.000
But I want to introduce our celebrities tonight for match game.

02:11:57.000 --> 02:12:01.000
Joining us for the match game tonight, Dark Sakura.

02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:03.000
You've never heard her before.

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:04.000
Hi.

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:07.000
Also joining us for the match game tonight is Tech Master Loki.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:08.000
Hi.

02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:11.000
And I'm going to be joining you for the match game tonight.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:12.000
Woo hoo.

02:12:12.000 --> 02:12:15.000
Also joining us for the match game tonight, Say Hello 2.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000
It's your first time on the show. Be gentle.

02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:18.000
Rachel.

02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:19.000
Howdy.

02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:20.000
How you doing?

02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:24.000
Are you here to promote anything tonight? Is there a new movie coming out that you need to promote?

02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:25.000
Or a book?

02:12:25.000 --> 02:12:27.000
Uh, quick blog plug?

02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:28.000
Yeah, sure.

02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:31.000
Uh, greetings from the wasteland at WordPress.

02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:32.000
There you go.

02:12:32.000 --> 02:12:34.000
Uh, greetings from the wasteland. Sorry.

02:12:34.000 --> 02:12:39.000
But it doesn't stop there. We have one more person playing match game with us tonight.

02:12:39.000 --> 02:12:41.000
Say hello, everybody, to Alan.

02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:44.000
Raspberry.

02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:45.000
How are you doing, Alan?

02:12:45.000 --> 02:12:46.000
Good.

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:48.000
Is there anything?

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:50.000
Are you doing your Carol Channing for us tonight?

02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:53.000
Is that, uh, is that, uh, what you're going to do match game as?

02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:54.000
No, I'm fine.

02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:56.000
Do you have anything you want to promote tonight?

02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:58.000
No.

02:12:58.000 --> 02:13:00.000
Do you want to promote Fabulous Flank?

02:13:00.000 --> 02:13:02.000
Oh, I'm really sorry about that.

02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:07.000
I want to promote new internet that's not dropping out.

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.000
Yeah, apparently it's doing pretty well.

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:10.000
So, hooray to that.

02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.000
Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line.

02:13:12.000 --> 02:13:16.000
If you want to, remember, we're going to have one contestant in the chat room, one on the Skype line.

02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:19.000
If you want to play match game, call us in the Skype line right now.

02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:24.000
Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:27.000
So, we're going to pick one person on the phones and another from our chat room.

02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:30.000
Uh, it looks like we have a few correct answers right now.

02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:35.000
So, again, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username in Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:38.000
While we wait for that call, because there is a little bit of a delay still,

02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:41.000
and I think the delay got longer because of our setup,

02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:44.000
but that's okay, I'd rather it be a longer delay and not drop out as much.

02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:49.000
Um, so, anyhow, what I want to, oh, we got a call coming in.

02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:52.000
Let's, let's see.

02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:55.000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:13:55.000 --> 02:13:57.000
Hey, this is SSJ100 Matt.

02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:59.000
Hey, SSJ100 Matt, how you doing?

02:13:59.000 --> 02:14:00.000
Hi, how are you?

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:02.000
I feel like I haven't heard from you in a while.

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.000
You did alright through Sandy and all that?

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:06.000
I did, actually.

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:07.000
Good, good, I'm glad to hear it.

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:09.000
Well, are you ready to play some match game with us tonight?

02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:10.000
Hells yeah.

02:14:10.000 --> 02:14:11.000
Hells yeah.

02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:12.000
Hells yeah.

02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:16.000
Alright, it looks like we have only four people in chat that want to play along,

02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:18.000
so, uh, let's see.

02:14:18.000 --> 02:14:21.000
Alan, since you can't see chat, pick a number between one and four.

02:14:21.000 --> 02:14:22.000
Two.

02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:26.000
Two, meaning actdeft is going to play along in our chat room.

02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:31.000
So, actdeft is our chatter tonight, so let me just send him a message.

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:33.000
Stand by.

02:14:33.000 --> 02:14:36.000
Okay, so, here we go.

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:42.000
We have actdeft versus SSJ100 Matt, because we haven't played this in a long time.

02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:43.000
Here's how it works.

02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:47.000
We're going to read a question, and that question will have a blank.

02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:51.000
Your job is to match the stars here in studio.

02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:53.000
You're going to come up with the answer that goes in that blank,

02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:56.000
and for every person that you match, you get a point.

02:14:56.000 --> 02:14:59.000
Keep in mind, actdeft is playing against you in the chat room.

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.000
He'll be sending his answers over a private message,

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.000
and you will be giving yours over the phone,

02:15:03.000 --> 02:15:09.000
but remember, please do not give your answers until we have a ding from everybody here in the studio.

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:12.000
All right, do you understand the rules, SSJ100 Matt?

02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:13.000
I do.

02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:14.000
All right, that's because you've played before.

02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:15.000
All right, yes, Alan?

02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:16.000
Yeah.

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:18.000
I just want to add that we're all really bad at this,

02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:20.000
because I remember the last time we played this,

02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:23.000
and not a single one of us matched shit with anyone.

02:15:23.000 --> 02:15:25.000
That's the joke.

02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.000
No, it's not.

02:15:27.000 --> 02:15:29.000
All right, here we go.

02:15:29.000 --> 02:15:33.000
Let's get into tonight's first question.

02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:35.000
Drum roll, please.

02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:36.000
Here we go.

02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:37.000
Tonight's first question.

02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:39.000
Four questions tonight.

02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:43.000
As Space Harrier's biggest fan,

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:48.000
Jamie is very excited about Space Harrier coming to the 3DS.

02:15:48.000 --> 02:15:52.000
She found it odd, though, that in her honor,

02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:55.000
the designers changed the opening line from

02:15:55.000 --> 02:15:58.000
welcome to the fantasy zone, get ready,

02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:09.000
to welcome to the blank, get ready.

02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:10.000
As Space Harrier's biggest fan,

02:16:10.000 --> 02:16:13.000
Jamie is very excited about Space Harrier coming to the 3DS.

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:16.000
She found it odd, though, that in her honor,

02:16:16.000 --> 02:16:19.000
the designers changed the opening line from

02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:21.000
welcome to the fantasy zone, get ready,

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:24.000
to welcome to the...

02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:25.000
What the fuck was that?

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:28.000
Welcome to the blank, get ready.

02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:30.000
I'm sorry you've been beeped.

02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:34.000
Apparently, I got censored by this crappy Think Music MP3,

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:35.000
so we'll pause that.

02:16:35.000 --> 02:16:39.000
All right, so I'm going to say ding.

02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:40.000
Ding.

02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:41.000
Ding.

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:42.000
Ding, Alan.

02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:43.000
Ding.

02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:44.000
Ding.

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:45.000
Okay, so we have five.

02:16:45.000 --> 02:16:46.000
Okay, I see the answer in chat.

02:16:46.000 --> 02:16:49.000
SSJ100, Matt, do you have an answer?

02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:50.000
I do.

02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:51.000
Welcome to the...

02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:53.000
Welcome to the Citadel.

02:16:53.000 --> 02:16:56.000
Welcome to the Citadel, get ready.

02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000
Ah, going for the Mass Effect joke there.

02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.000
Well, let's check in with the woman herself.

02:17:00.000 --> 02:17:02.000
They're changing it from welcome to the fantasy zone,

02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:04.000
get ready, to welcome to the...

02:17:04.000 --> 02:17:05.000
Fantasy zone.

02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:06.000
What?

02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:10.000
PH8, fantasy zone, the RPG.

02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:13.000
Oh, look at you, clever gal.

02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:17.000
Because I'm fucking clever.

02:17:17.000 --> 02:17:19.000
Somebody put that down as the quote of the night,

02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:21.000
because I'm fucking clever.

02:17:21.000 --> 02:17:22.000
Rachel.

02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:23.000
Frenzy from school.

02:17:23.000 --> 02:17:25.000
How well do we know Jamie?

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:26.000
Welcome to the...

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:27.000
Wii U.

02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:30.000
Welcome to the Wii U, get ready.

02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:31.000
Wait, what was...

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:32.000
Act Def.

02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:33.000
Oh, I'm so sorry.

02:17:33.000 --> 02:17:34.000
Act Def.

02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:35.000
I'm not ignoring Act Def.

02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000
Act Def said...

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:38.000
Garrus zone.

02:17:38.000 --> 02:17:39.000
I'm a little rusty.

02:17:39.000 --> 02:17:40.000
I'm out of practice.

02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:41.000
We haven't played this in over a year.

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:44.000
Welcome to the Garrus zone, get ready.

02:17:44.000 --> 02:17:47.000
So two Mass Effect answers, but a little different there.

02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.000
So we have welcome to the Citadel, welcome to the Garrus zone.

02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:51.000
All right, Loki, welcome to the...

02:17:51.000 --> 02:17:52.000
I have Citadel.

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:53.000
Did you really?

02:17:53.000 --> 02:17:54.000
I did.

02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:56.000
A point for SSJ 100 mass.

02:17:56.000 --> 02:17:57.000
Look at that, Alan.

02:17:57.000 --> 02:17:59.000
Look at that, a point.

02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:00.000
I have it.

02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:01.000
It's typed on my screen and everything.

02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:03.000
All right, there it is.

02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:04.000
All right.

02:18:04.000 --> 02:18:10.000
Speaking of Alan, who says that these things always end in a 0-0 tie, welcome to the...

02:18:10.000 --> 02:18:11.000
Pinkberry.

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:13.000
That was a good answer.

02:18:13.000 --> 02:18:15.000
I should have said Pinkberry.

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:16.000
That is a good answer.

02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:18.000
Welcome to the Pinkberry, get ready.

02:18:18.000 --> 02:18:23.000
And my answer was welcome to the Normandy, get ready.

02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:24.000
So close.

02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:25.000
So close.

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:26.000
So close.

02:18:26.000 --> 02:18:27.000
But you know what?

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000
I'm not taking pity because you already got a point.

02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:30.000
So there it is.

02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:33.000
The score all in the lead there.

02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:35.000
SSJ 100 mass has one point.

02:18:35.000 --> 02:18:37.000
Act Def has zero.

02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000
All right, here we go.

02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:41.000
On to the next question.

02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:42.000
Question number two.

02:18:42.000 --> 02:18:45.000
You feeling good about that lead, SSJ 100 mass?

02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:46.000
I'm feeling great.

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:47.000
All right, feeling great.

02:18:47.000 --> 02:18:50.000
Here we go to question number two.

02:18:50.000 --> 02:19:00.000
THQ might have said that the Wii U has a horrible slow CPU, but Loki is on record saying that

02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:05.000
the Wii U has a horrible slow blank.

02:19:08.000 --> 02:19:14.000
THQ might have said that the Wii U has a horrible slow CPU, but Loki is on record saying that

02:19:14.000 --> 02:19:18.000
the Wii U has a horrible slow blank.

02:19:23.000 --> 02:19:24.000
Ding.

02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:25.000
Ding.

02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:26.000
Ding.

02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:31.000
I don't know if I can make this smaller now.

02:19:31.000 --> 02:19:33.000
Has a horrible slow.

02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:34.000
Ding.

02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:35.000
I'll just.

02:19:35.000 --> 02:19:36.000
I'll do it live.

02:19:36.000 --> 02:19:38.000
No, you have to write the answer down.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:39.000
All right, fine.

02:19:39.000 --> 02:19:42.000
Or else Alan's going to come over there and say, you rigged it.

02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:43.000
You rigged it.

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:49.000
Alan is the Mass Effect po-po, you know.

02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:50.000
All right.

02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:51.000
Right, Alan?

02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:53.000
All right.

02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:54.000
Okay, here we go.

02:19:54.000 --> 02:19:55.000
Does that mean he's seasick?

02:19:55.000 --> 02:19:56.000
We have an answer.

02:19:56.000 --> 02:19:57.000
Shut up.

02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:00.000
We have an answer for MacDeft, so that means we are ready to go.

02:20:00.000 --> 02:20:02.000
SSJ 100, Matt, you have that answer in your mind?

02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:03.000
Yep, I do.

02:20:03.000 --> 02:20:04.000
All right, here we go.

02:20:04.000 --> 02:20:09.000
THQ might have said that the Wii U has a horrible slow CPU, but Loki is on record saying that

02:20:09.000 --> 02:20:12.000
the Wii U has a horrible slow.

02:20:12.000 --> 02:20:14.000
Rendering of tits slash boobs.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:16.000
Rendering of boobs.

02:20:16.000 --> 02:20:17.000
Tits.

02:20:17.000 --> 02:20:18.000
Okay, good.

02:20:18.000 --> 02:20:24.000
ActDeft says a horrible slow maker or company.

02:20:24.000 --> 02:20:25.000
He's saying Nintendo is slow.

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:26.000
Get it?

02:20:26.000 --> 02:20:27.000
I get it.

02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:28.000
I get it.

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:29.000
We'll see.

02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:30.000
We'll see how that pays off.

02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:31.000
All right.

02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:33.000
Has a horrible slow dark soccer.

02:20:33.000 --> 02:20:34.000
Boob jiggle.

02:20:34.000 --> 02:20:36.000
Boob jiggle.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.000
Oh, that's really close.

02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:39.000
I'd say half a point.

02:20:39.000 --> 02:20:40.000
That's really close.

02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:44.000
And I wouldn't even say that a slow boob jiggle would be a bad thing.

02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:50.000
Alan is the unofficial, I almost said Mass Effect Judge, as the unofficial match game

02:20:50.000 --> 02:20:51.000
judge.

02:20:51.000 --> 02:20:53.000
Do you think boob jiggle is a match with boob rendering?

02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:54.000
I will allow it.

02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:56.000
I will allow it.

02:20:56.000 --> 02:20:58.000
Two points for SSJ 100, Matt.

02:20:58.000 --> 02:21:00.000
No points for ActDeft.

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:01.000
That's okay, ActDeft.

02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:02.000
That's okay.

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000
Rachel, a horrible slow.

02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:05.000
Booty.

02:21:05.000 --> 02:21:06.000
Booty.

02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:09.000
Booty and boobies are very different.

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:10.000
Some people are tits.

02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:11.000
Some people are ass.

02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:13.000
So those are two different answers for sure.

02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:15.000
If we gave them one, we're not going to give them both.

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:16.000
All right.

02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:17.000
Loki.

02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:25.000
Loki, you are on record saying the Wii U has a horrible slow.

02:21:25.000 --> 02:21:27.000
Adoption of online protocols.

02:21:27.000 --> 02:21:31.000
Adoption of online protocols.

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:34.000
Good answer, but not a match.

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:37.000
Has a horrible slow.

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:38.000
Bacon grilling peripheral.

02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000
Bacon grilling peripheral.

02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:42.000
A very good Loki answer, but not a match.

02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:46.000
No, we don't want a horrible bacon grilling.

02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:52.000
And I said the Wii U has a horrible slow ego.

02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:53.000
Ego.

02:21:53.000 --> 02:21:54.000
Not a match.

02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:55.000
Not a match.

02:21:55.000 --> 02:21:57.000
All right, so the score is two to zero.

02:21:57.000 --> 02:21:59.000
ActDeft, you still have two questions.

02:21:59.000 --> 02:22:01.000
You still have two questions.

02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:03.000
You could tie it up easy if you get one on each of these.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:07.000
All right, here we go to question number three.

02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000
Question number three.

02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:17.000
Rob was shocked to hear that the R4 cartridges were being banned everywhere.

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:22.000
Upon hearing of the latest ban, Rob shouted at Allen,

02:22:22.000 --> 02:22:27.000
quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of blank.

02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:36.000
Rob shouted at Allen, quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of blank.

02:22:36.000 --> 02:22:38.000
I don't even know what to say for this one.

02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:44.000
In my stash of, OK, I got one.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:48.000
Quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of blank.

02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.000
Loki says ding.

02:22:50.000 --> 02:22:51.000
Rachel's still thinking.

02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:52.000
Allen says ding.

02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:53.000
That's all right, Rachel.

02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:54.000
I know we just met earlier tonight.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000
It might be hard to think of a way to razz me.

02:22:56.000 --> 02:22:58.000
She's looking around.

02:22:58.000 --> 02:23:00.000
What the hell is this guy like?

02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:01.000
It's all right.

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:02.000
You can make something up.

02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:03.000
They'll never know.

02:23:03.000 --> 02:23:04.000
All right.

02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:05.000
Ding.

02:23:05.000 --> 02:23:06.000
All right, ding it is.

02:23:06.000 --> 02:23:09.000
All right, and I see a ding from actdeft.

02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.000
SSJ100, Matt, you ready to answer?

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:12.000
Yeah, I got one.

02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:13.000
All right, here we go.

02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:16.000
Rob was shocked to hear that the R4 cartridges were being banned everywhere.

02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:25.000
Upon hearing of the latest ban, Rob shouted at Allen, quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of blank.

02:23:25.000 --> 02:23:29.000
Rob shouted at Allen, quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of blank.

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:35.000
Rob shouted at Allen, quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of blank.

02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:41.000
I'm going to go with a classic match game answer with non-silon-occupied Caprica.

02:23:41.000 --> 02:23:47.000
Non-silon-occupied Caprica in my stash of non-silon-occupied Caprica.

02:23:47.000 --> 02:23:53.000
I don't know how well that's going to go over with somebody who is brand new to the show tonight, but we'll see what happens.

02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:57.000
All right, actdeft says dating sims and hentai games.

02:23:57.000 --> 02:24:03.000
You have to understand, there are so many people that are like, what does non-silon-occupied Caprica even mean?

02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000
I can't even say it right anymore.

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:06.000
It's an old-ass joke.

02:24:06.000 --> 02:24:07.000
It's a really funny joke.

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:12.000
Like, it would have been just about as funny as if he said, in my stash of big black cocks, but he didn't.

02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:24.000
All right, anyhow, quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of...

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:25.000
Dark Sakura?

02:24:25.000 --> 02:24:26.000
Big black cocks?

02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:28.000
Big black cocks!

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:31.000
Oh, and I didn't let him change the answer.

02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:36.000
All right, quick, hide the... Did I really read your mind?

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.000
All right, quick.

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:43.000
What do you expect? Someone that was talking about, you know, drawings of vaginas earlier.

02:24:43.000 --> 02:24:45.000
That's true, that's true. She's got porn on the...

02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:50.000
It sounds like actdeft's answer of dating sims and hentai games almost was a match there.

02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000
Dating sims and hentai games.

02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:56.000
All right, Rachel, my stash of...

02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:57.000
Twilight books.

02:24:57.000 --> 02:25:02.000
Twilight books? Get out!

02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:05.000
I don't own Twilight books. You made that up.

02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:08.000
I could have said Fifty Shades of Grey. Look on the bright side.

02:25:08.000 --> 02:25:09.000
That's true. All right, I'll give you that.

02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:12.000
Really? Does Rob look like a 14-year-old Mormon girl?

02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:15.000
Well...

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000
If only it were a TV show.

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:21.000
All right, Loki, quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of...

02:25:21.000 --> 02:25:22.000
Cat pictures.

02:25:22.000 --> 02:25:26.000
Cat pictures! Good answer. Not a match.

02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:30.000
Alan, quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of...

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:33.000
New, still in box, President Cat merchandise.

02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:38.000
New, still in box, President Cat merchandise. Not a match.

02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:41.000
And my answer, the most important one, clearly.

02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:47.000
Quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of... Disney pins?

02:25:47.000 --> 02:25:49.000
That's very accurate.

02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:52.000
I know. Sorry I played it straight on that one.

02:25:52.000 --> 02:25:55.000
All right. Womp womp. All right.

02:25:55.000 --> 02:25:58.000
Act Deaf, it is still 2-0.

02:25:58.000 --> 02:26:01.000
Let's see, Shane is in chat. Shane Alinko in chat says,

02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:04.000
I own the Twilight books and I'm not a 14-year-old Mormon girl.

02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:05.000
Yes, you are.

02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:07.000
You make me a very sad person on chat.

02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:10.000
Act Deaf says, fuck, I was gonna say President Cat.

02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000
Woulda, coulda, shoulda.

02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:15.000
Dating Sims is a pretty good answer, though, even though I don't own any.

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:16.000
All right.

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:18.000
I have Dating Sims. They're yowie.

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:21.000
Here's your chance to close the gap, Act Deaf.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:24.000
You feeling pretty good about this, SSJ100 Matt?

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:25.000
I'm feeling golden.

02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:28.000
You're feeling golden. Here you go. One more question.

02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:31.000
Here we go. Last question.

02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:39.000
Peter Molyneux recently advertised Goddess on the Cube in Curiosity.

02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:47.000
It turns out that what Peter put inside the Cube is actually just an ad for blank.

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:49.000
Blank.

02:26:49.000 --> 02:26:52.000
Y'all know Curiosity, what's in the Cube?

02:26:52.000 --> 02:27:03.000
Well, Goddess was advertised on the Cube and it turns out what Peter put in the Cube is actually just an ad for blank.

02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:07.000
What is in the Cube is actually just an ad for blank.

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:09.000
Ding in a major way.

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:11.000
Ding.

02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:13.000
Ding.

02:27:13.000 --> 02:27:15.000
Ding.

02:27:16.000 --> 02:27:19.000
Yes, I did. In a major way. Way to listen, Rob.

02:27:19.000 --> 02:27:21.000
I wasn't listening to you because I was thinking of an answer.

02:27:21.000 --> 02:27:25.000
Even though I think of the questions before the show, I don't think of the answers.

02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:28.000
You know what? That's a likely story. I don't believe you.

02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:31.000
All right. An ad for blank.

02:27:31.000 --> 02:27:36.000
All right. Looks like Act Deaf is Ding and SSJ100 Matt, you ready with an answer?

02:27:36.000 --> 02:27:37.000
Yep.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:41.000
All right. Peter Molyneux recently advertised Goddess on the Cube in Curiosity.

02:27:41.000 --> 02:27:47.000
It turns out that what Peter put in the Cube is actually just an ad for...

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:48.000
Ovaltine.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:52.000
Ovaltine.

02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:55.000
I like Ovaltine.

02:27:55.000 --> 02:27:56.000
That's great.

02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:58.000
That's a far better answer than you guys deserve.

02:27:58.000 --> 02:27:59.000
That is true, yes.

02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:03.000
All right. Well, let's go to Act Deaf. He has an answer too, you know.

02:28:03.000 --> 02:28:07.000
What he put in the Cube is actually just an ad for...

02:28:08.000 --> 02:28:13.000
Hoping that we'll be ready to self-promote here on OLR tonight.

02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:16.000
So an ad for the VoG network in the Cube. Let's take a look.

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:17.000
DarkSakura.

02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:21.000
What he put in the Cube is actually just an ad for...

02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:22.000
Propel.

02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:23.000
Propel.

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:25.000
I'm going old school tonight.

02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:29.000
Oh, you guys and the references. All right. Good answer. Not a match.

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:33.000
All right. What Peter put in the Cube is actually just an ad for...

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:34.000
Rachel?

02:28:34.000 --> 02:28:36.000
Goddess catch them all.

02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:39.000
Goddess catch them all.

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:44.000
It burns, doesn't it? It's not a good burn.

02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:49.000
Ladies and gentlemen, who knew that Rachel was the 24th Magus, everybody?

02:28:49.000 --> 02:28:51.000
Here in studio.

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:53.000
I will explain this to you.

02:28:53.000 --> 02:28:56.000
Yeah, you'll have to explain that later. All right.

02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:59.000
Is she going to break a soundboard table now?

02:28:59.000 --> 02:29:00.000
She might.

02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:03.000
I don't know. This table's a lot sturdier than the one that Drew broke.

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:07.000
After nobody matches her, she might just flip the table over. We'll see.

02:29:07.000 --> 02:29:12.000
All right, Loki, what Peter put in the Cube is actually just an ad for...

02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:16.000
You know, I don't know how to pronounce this, but I'm going to try to. It's...

02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:17.000
Schrodinger.

02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:21.000
Would it be Schrodinger or Schrodinger's cat?

02:29:21.000 --> 02:29:25.000
No. Everyone likes cats, so it's just Schrodinger.

02:29:25.000 --> 02:29:27.000
See how he likes it!

02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:33.000
Clever answer. That's too intellectual for you, Loki. All right.

02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:36.000
Should I have said penises or like, you know...

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:39.000
You are a Mensa member after all. All right.

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:41.000
It is just an ad for...

02:29:41.000 --> 02:29:42.000
Alan?

02:29:42.000 --> 02:29:45.000
Pure unsubstantiated hype the video game.

02:29:45.000 --> 02:29:49.000
Pure unsubstantiated hype the video game.

02:29:49.000 --> 02:29:51.000
You know, that's not as good as they say.

02:29:51.000 --> 02:29:57.000
All right. And lastly, my answer, we'll see if it's a match for Act Deft with the VOG Network or...

02:29:57.000 --> 02:30:00.000
Whatever Matt said, I can't even remember now.

02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:01.000
Ovaltine.

02:30:01.000 --> 02:30:02.000
Ovaltine.

02:30:03.000 --> 02:30:08.000
Here it is. Peter Molyneux recently advertised Goddess on the Cube in curiosity.

02:30:08.000 --> 02:30:13.000
It turns out that what Peter put in the Cube is actually just an ad for...

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:14.000
Douche.

02:30:15.000 --> 02:30:16.000
Good night, everybody!

02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:21.000
That's gonna conclude the match game tonight.

02:30:21.000 --> 02:30:24.000
SSJ 100 Matt wins!

02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:28.000
In a score of 2 to 0.

02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
Alan, 2 to 0.

02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:31.000
All right.

02:30:33.000 --> 02:30:37.000
Act Deft, thank you so much for playing, but sorry you're a loser. There's the door.

02:30:37.000 --> 02:30:41.000
SSJ 100 Matt, congratulations. You win.

02:30:41.000 --> 02:30:46.000
And as the winner, you get to pimp or promote anything you want to on the program tonight.

02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:52.000
Well, I don't really have anything to promote, so I'm just gonna promote the VOG Network.

02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:57.000
Oh, it's like the ad was really in the center after all.

02:30:57.000 --> 02:30:58.000
All right.

02:30:58.000 --> 02:30:59.000
Feel the love.

02:30:59.000 --> 02:31:00.000
You're so nice.

02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000
Oh, the feels. The feels. All right.

02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:03.000
All the feels.

02:31:03.000 --> 02:31:09.000
SSJ 100 Matt, congratulations. You won the first match game on OLR in like a year and a half, so walk away with that trophy.

02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:12.000
And maybe somebody will try to take it from you in 2013.

02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:13.000
We'll see.

02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000
All right. Have a good night, buddy.

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:16.000
Have a good night, guys.

02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:17.000
All right. Bye.

02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:19.000
All right. That was fun. That was fun.

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:24.000
Thank you, Alan, for walking in and doing a cameo. Not like I pressured you into it or anything.

02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:25.000
You're welcome.

02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:28.000
By the way, the taquitos were A+. Thank you.

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:30.000
It was quite delicious. Thank you.

02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:32.000
Alan takes good care of us during the show. We appreciate it.

02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:33.000
All right.

02:31:33.000 --> 02:31:34.000
All right.

02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:37.000
Let us move on with a few more stories.

02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:43.000
And then we're going to open up the Skype line for regular calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:46.000
Or, of course, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.

02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:53.000
Oh, we have more stuff we've got to get to before we get to the stories, though, such as the mailbag.

02:31:56.000 --> 02:32:00.000
Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us your e-mails.

02:32:00.000 --> 02:32:04.000
And DarkSakura will dive into the mailbag headfirst and read a few e-mails that tickles your fancy.

02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:06.000
Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.

02:32:06.000 --> 02:32:07.000
Okay.

02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.000
What's inside the mailbag?

02:32:09.000 --> 02:32:10.000
Cock.

02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:11.000
Okay.

02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:12.000
Um, have you...

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:17.000
Okay, this comes from Alex. I'm just going to say Alex.

02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:22.000
Have you ever tried placing your games in a numbered list and picking a number at random?

02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:29.000
I've been surprised on many occasions to find out how much fun I've had playing an old game or playing a game I thought I was not in the mood for, thanks to this method.

02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:31.000
One more thing.

02:32:31.000 --> 02:32:34.000
MMORPGs get a number for each character.

02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:36.000
Okay.

02:32:36.000 --> 02:32:38.000
Take care and happy gaming.

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:39.000
I've never done that.

02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:40.000
No, I get what he's saying.

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:45.000
He's saying, like, you know, for the MMOs you play, give a number to each of your characters and throw them in the mix.

02:32:45.000 --> 02:32:48.000
For the record, making something plural, you do not use an apostrophe.

02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:49.000
Stop.

02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:50.000
You know what?

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000
I think it's a neat idea, actually.

02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:54.000
I think the idea is, like, really rad.

02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:59.000
Can you imagine if you had a spreadsheet of every game in the vault, one through, like, a thousand?

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:06.000
We tried this and got so wiped out trying to list every freaking game that we own that, no.

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:08.000
It spread out to imaginary numbers.

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:10.000
There was algebra involved and it wasn't pretty.

02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:15.000
You had to use the E plus 10 and all that stuff to get the games in there.

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:16.000
I think it's a great idea.

02:33:16.000 --> 02:33:19.000
Like, I think that would make an awesome, like, marathon idea.

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:23.000
Like, you know, I know, OLR, we've been teasing the idea of doing a marathon for, like, ten years.

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:29.000
But I think it would be great to, like, number all the games in the vault and then have our donators pick a random number.

02:33:29.000 --> 02:33:31.000
And that would be the game we'd be forced to play.

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000
Wouldn't that be fun, DarkSagra?

02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:34.000
Yes.

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:35.000
Like, can you imagine if somebody-

02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:37.000
As long as we don't put shit on the list.

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:38.000
Or, like, ET?

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:40.000
Do you own ET?

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:42.000
I think I do, actually.

02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:43.000
Now, here's the other question.

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000
Would each copy of Space Harrier get a number?

02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:48.000
All right.

02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:49.000
Next email.

02:33:50.000 --> 02:33:51.000
Next up.

02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:53.000
Oh, that was the one I just read.

02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:56.000
They're very small.

02:33:57.000 --> 02:33:59.000
This one comes from Will.

02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:04.000
I strangely enjoy when Rob breaks into the show to give the VoG passphrase.

02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:05.000
He sounds so serious.

02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:07.000
That's it?

02:34:08.000 --> 02:34:11.000
Today's password is cheeseball.

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:12.000
That's not really the password.

02:34:12.000 --> 02:34:13.000
No.

02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:14.000
I don't pick that.

02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:15.000
The password-

02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:16.000
It's randomly generated.

02:34:16.000 --> 02:34:21.000
Yeah, the passphrases get picked for me after the show with a little thing that Bobby wrote.

02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:23.000
Today's passcode is cock.

02:34:23.000 --> 02:34:24.000
No, it's not.

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:25.000
Don't put that in the box.

02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:27.000
She doesn't know it, because we don't know it's allowed in the show.

02:34:27.000 --> 02:34:28.000
What if the weapon did pop up?

02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:32.000
It's not going to have cock, because Bobby filtered all the adult words off of it, I'm sure.

02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:33.000
Aw.

02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:34.000
Dang it, Bobby.

02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:37.000
It'll be spelled with a zero and a five in place of the S.

02:34:37.000 --> 02:34:38.000
For April-

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:39.000
You know what, Bobby?

02:34:39.000 --> 02:34:40.000
Remind me.

02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:45.000
April Fool's Day next year, people who put naughty words in the box unlock a bar of soap trophy.

02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:46.000
Can we make that happen?

02:34:46.000 --> 02:34:47.000
All right.

02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:48.000
Anyhow-

02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:49.000
You got four months to work on it.

02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:53.000
Here's a chance for me to re-pimp this, though, because we haven't talked about it in a while.

02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:58.000
If you listen to the shows live at vognetwork.com, you can check into the show as the show is

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:02.000
happening and get your five vog points, which go for the loot.

02:35:02.000 --> 02:35:04.000
And what do vog points get you?

02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:05.000
Absolutely nothing.

02:35:05.000 --> 02:35:06.000
It's just a fun-

02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.000
But what does Foursquare and Facebook check-ins give you?

02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:10.000
It's just a fun little game within a game.

02:35:10.000 --> 02:35:14.000
Someday, there may be more to come from it in 2013.

02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:17.000
We're throwing around ideas.

02:35:17.000 --> 02:35:25.000
But for those that can't join us live, what we do is we put a passphrase somewhere in the show.

02:35:25.000 --> 02:35:27.000
You might have already heard it earlier in the show.

02:35:27.000 --> 02:35:29.000
You might hear it still coming up.

02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:31.000
It's always in a random point in the show.

02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:35.000
If you put that passphrase into a box you see on the front page of vognetwork.com,

02:35:35.000 --> 02:35:39.000
you can get those same five points that you would have got if you listened live.

02:35:39.000 --> 02:35:40.000
It's like you get the same credit.

02:35:40.000 --> 02:35:43.000
So please note, you can't get the five points twice.

02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:48.000
Although you still can check in just to register yourself as you listen to the podcast

02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:50.000
and you listen live just to see if there were any differences.

02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000
But you don't get the extra points.

02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000
But anyhow, we hope you'll play along.

02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000
It's just a fun thing to do at vognetwork.com.

02:35:56.000 --> 02:36:00.000
And we do look to adding some fun little note prizes.

02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:05.000
Like maybe the person with the most amount of points will get to program the station for a day.

02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:07.000
I'm throwing it out there.

02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:08.000
These aren't actual things.

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:09.000
But we're looking at doing things like that.

02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:12.000
Translated to give Bobby a migraine for a day.

02:36:14.000 --> 02:36:18.000
And Tigerclaw and Act Deaf in chat remind us bragging rights is what you get.

02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:19.000
Bragging rights.

02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:23.000
I like note prizes like Marvel used to do where the people would just get a blank envelope.

02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:28.000
I think maybe in 2013 what we should do, especially since we're all getting into,

02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:31.000
like you're doing crocheting and all these different projects,

02:36:31.000 --> 02:36:36.000
we should give our leaderboard leader every month a homemade prize.

02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:38.000
That means I have to make it.

02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:40.000
No, no. It doesn't have to be you every time. You can do one.

02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:42.000
We can make something out of popsicle sticks.

02:36:42.000 --> 02:36:44.000
But remember, there's more than just us on VOG.

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:45.000
Hello.

02:36:45.000 --> 02:36:47.000
It could be like one week.

02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:52.000
It could be maybe Brad from Pod Culture could send something homemade.

02:36:52.000 --> 02:36:53.000
This is what we should do.

02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:55.000
Have a contest. It starts in January.

02:36:56.000 --> 02:37:02.000
Whoever gets the top of a leaderboard the most times in the period of a year

02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:04.000
gets an orange beanie crocheted by me.

02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
That could be one of the prizes.

02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:10.000
No, I'm making this a contest.

02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:13.000
We need to talk about this off-air first.

02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:14.000
We've got to coordinate it with Bob.

02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:15.000
Bobby is the game master after all.

02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:17.000
He might be like, wait.

02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:18.000
So we'll talk off-air.

02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:20.000
But yes, we're going to keep enhancing the game.

02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:21.000
It's always in progress.

02:37:21.000 --> 02:37:22.000
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:24.000
Always in beta, just like Gmail.

02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000
Last email.

02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:29.000
This comes from Travis.

02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:31.000
Donovan?

02:37:31.000 --> 02:37:33.000
No, not Donovan.

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:34.000
Hey, gang.

02:37:34.000 --> 02:37:35.000
Haven't wrote or called in a while.

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:38.000
Thought I would drop a line and say, hey, I got a Wii U over the weekend

02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:40.000
and heard Rob talking about his last episode.

02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:42.000
I'm happy with it so far.

02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:47.000
I have an 8-Yo, sorry, year-old, and he absolutely loves it.

02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:50.000
Also, friends and family have a blast with it too.

02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:54.000
Just wondering, after a week of having it, what do you think?

02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:56.000
Rob, get out of the fridge.

02:37:56.000 --> 02:37:57.000
Come answer the question.

02:37:57.000 --> 02:37:58.000
I wanted an Oreo.

02:37:58.000 --> 02:37:59.000
I want an Oreo.

02:37:59.000 --> 02:38:00.000
Thank you.

02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:03.000
You want an Oreo too, Rachel?

02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:04.000
I'll get you an Oreo later.

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:05.000
I'm good.

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:06.000
All right.

02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:09.000
Well, I talked about the Wii U at the top of the show.

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:11.000
I don't think I have a lot else to add.

02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:14.000
I am not disappointed with my investment.

02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:19.000
But, again, how important is Mario and Nintendo Land

02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:20.000
and some of these like ZombiU?

02:38:20.000 --> 02:38:22.000
How important are those games to you?

02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:25.000
If you think you can wait on those games until 2013, then wait.

02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:27.000
But if you want to play them now,

02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:30.000
and you have the financial resources available to play them now,

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:31.000
then go get one.

02:38:31.000 --> 02:38:32.000
It's fun.

02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:34.000
Keep talking.

02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:37.000
No, I'm done.

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:38.000
That's all I have to say on the Wii U.

02:38:38.000 --> 02:38:40.000
I talked for like 40 minutes during part A.

02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:41.000
Okay.

02:38:42.000 --> 02:38:44.000
Oreos from the fridge are the best.

02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:45.000
Okay.

02:38:45.000 --> 02:38:46.000
Matt, you want one?

02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:47.000
No.

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:49.000
I do not want an Oreo.

02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:53.000
I'm pretty excited about Lego City, a new Zelda, and an F-Zero game.

02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:55.000
Being a PlayStation fanboy and a PC gamer,

02:38:55.000 --> 02:38:59.000
I have to say I'm not blown away, but still very impressed with it.

02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:00.000
Those are all in caps.

02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:01.000
How am I supposed to emote that?

02:39:03.000 --> 02:39:05.000
Oh, by the way, my friend requested you,

02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000
but we'll have to do it again under a different name.

02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:09.000
Long story short, I had to get a replacement system

02:39:09.000 --> 02:39:11.000
as my first one I purchased was faulty.

02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:12.000
Quoty.

02:39:12.000 --> 02:39:13.000
Faulty.

02:39:14.000 --> 02:39:15.000
That sucks.

02:39:15.000 --> 02:39:17.000
You had some bad luck.

02:39:17.000 --> 02:39:18.000
Done.

02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:26.000
Jason is quick to correct me in the chat room at live.vognetwork.com.

02:39:26.000 --> 02:39:29.000
Gmail hasn't been in beta for more than a few years now.

02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:30.000
Whatever.

02:39:31.000 --> 02:39:34.000
We've been in beta for like, what, eight months?

02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:37.000
Gmail was in beta for like six years.

02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:39.000
We have a ways to go.

02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:40.000
Hyperbole what now?

02:39:42.000 --> 02:39:43.000
All right.

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.000
Let's get into the FUs of the week.

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:01.000
This is fucked up.

02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:04.000
Now Rachel, since you're new to the FUs of the week,

02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:06.000
I don't know if Jamie told you about this in the car ride,

02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:08.000
but this is the part of the show where we just get to,

02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:09.000
we just get to rant.

02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:10.000
Why?

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:12.000
Well, because we have your attention.

02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:14.000
And when I have your attention, I like to rant.

02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:15.000
So it's the FUs of the week.

02:40:15.000 --> 02:40:16.000
Uh, Dersogra.

02:40:16.000 --> 02:40:18.000
I don't particularly have an FU.

02:40:18.000 --> 02:40:21.000
Um, I have a thank you to someone for saving me the trouble

02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.000
of doing what I planned on doing anyway.

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:26.000
Hiding a body?

02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:28.000
No.

02:40:28.000 --> 02:40:29.000
All right.

02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:30.000
Uh, Loki.

02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:33.000
I have to do the whole ride over here because for some reason,

02:40:33.000 --> 02:40:36.000
like everybody was out to try to kill me or something on the road.

02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:39.000
Like there's a dude, I hate it when they do this.

02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:41.000
Like when there's people waiting to like pull out of an,

02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:46.000
either like a plaza or like a driveway or something like that.

02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:49.000
And they're like kind of trying to time it so that they just pull out

02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:53.000
right after you pass, except they have no sense of timing whatsoever.

02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:55.000
So it's like, oh, hey, you're coming.

02:40:55.000 --> 02:40:56.000
I'm backing out right now.

02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:59.000
You know, and you have to dive into the other lane.

02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:01.000
So I had that happen twice on the way here.

02:41:01.000 --> 02:41:05.000
And then there was, um, what was the other dude?

02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.000
Oh, some other dude that was drifting into my lane.

02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:10.000
It's just paying fucking attention, people.

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:13.000
Seriously, you're going to kill somebody and hopefully not me.

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:18.000
Uh, my FU of the week goes to Oreos for being so delicious and addicting.

02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:19.000
Oh my God.

02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:21.000
But no, the other thing about that is I want to give an FU to the fact

02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:25.000
that I never got to have the birthday cake Oreos because they disappeared

02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:29.000
from shelves so fast and, and real problems, guys.

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.000
I never got to have the candy corn Oreos because they disappeared

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:33.000
from shelves so fast.

02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:35.000
Why can't I make these special Oreos if I can't find them?

02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:39.000
And while I'm at it, FU to the fact that there are no pumpkin kisses

02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:40.000
this, this year.

02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:42.000
That is a travesty.

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:44.000
True travesty.

02:41:44.000 --> 02:41:47.000
Didn't you hold on to like a pack of those for like six months?

02:41:47.000 --> 02:41:49.000
I did, and they were still delicious.

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:50.000
Sorry, not sorry.

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:52.000
I, I partook of them too.

02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000
eBay changed their logo.

02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000
Yeah, like months ago.

02:41:56.000 --> 02:42:00.000
Yeah, but I looked at eBay and fuck.

02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:01.000
All right.

02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.000
And last but not least, Rachel, do you have any FUs you want to get out?

02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:07.000
Uh, you know, I'd like to say FU to Michael Bay cause you know,

02:42:07.000 --> 02:42:09.000
you can never FU that guy enough.

02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:11.000
You know, on eBay, they are.

02:42:11.000 --> 02:42:12.000
That is a worthy first FU.

02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:13.000
Good job.

02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:14.000
Good job.

02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:17.000
You know, on eBay, they are selling those candy corn Oreos.

02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:18.000
Fuck eBay.

02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:21.000
And limited edition, like 15 bucks.

02:42:21.000 --> 02:42:26.000
Brad from Pod Culture says, Rob Roberts, try the gingerbread Oreos.

02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:28.000
They have gingerbread Oreos.

02:42:28.000 --> 02:42:30.000
I need this in my life.

02:42:30.000 --> 02:42:31.000
Ermahgerd.

02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:32.000
I need this in my life.

02:42:32.000 --> 02:42:35.000
Ermahgerd.

02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000
Let's go to some more stories.

02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:38.000
I need a cat in my life, Rob.

02:42:38.000 --> 02:42:43.000
And then you at 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.

02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:44.000
Loki.

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:51.000
So, the studio that puts out Football Manager 2013 says that, you know,

02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:58.000
their efforts to stop piracy by adding DRM has actually benefited them.

02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:05.000
They are saying that, you know, Football Manager 12 was pirated within the first two weeks of its release.

02:43:05.000 --> 02:43:09.000
However, because, you know, not day one cause of their DRM.

02:43:09.000 --> 02:43:18.000
They said, though, that the extra sales that they got at the time had helped them have new staff members for this year's release for Football Manager 13.

02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:26.000
And, you know, had they been pirated day one, they probably wouldn't have the money to have the extra staff.

02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:35.000
So, yeah, right now, I guess the new game has a new DRM system and as of right now hasn't been cracked.

02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:38.000
Although, they haven't, I don't know when it came out.

02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:45.000
And they said that if they can hold on for three or four more weeks, then it'll really benefit retailers and themselves.

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:49.000
Is it working?

02:43:49.000 --> 02:43:58.000
I mean, it's good when it works in the effort to, you know, get people to actually legitimately buy your copies of your games.

02:43:58.000 --> 02:44:07.000
However, when you have it implemented in a way like Ubisoft does, where it hurts the actual consumers that buy your games and kind of punishes them.

02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:11.000
Whereas, you know, the person that has the cracked copy has no issues and that's the problem.

02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000
So, you just kind of have to find that happy medium in there.

02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:21.000
I kind of think it's interesting how they talk about that like, you know, as long as we can hold off like three weeks before we get cracked, then we'll be good.

02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000
We'll still sell a lot of copies of the game.

02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:29.000
I find it interesting that they just kind of give in to the fact that like, yeah, hackers gonna hack, they're gonna get into the game eventually.

02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:36.000
But, it also, you know, that mentality that the majority, the vast majority of games are in their first week.

02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:43.000
So, I find it very interesting that it's like, as long as we can hold off to week three, enough people will have bought it by then, whatever, at that point.

02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:45.000
Very interesting.

02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:48.000
But, yeah, I also agree with what Loki said.

02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:53.000
As long as, you know, anti-piracy, you gotta do what you gotta do, but as long as it works.

02:44:54.000 --> 02:44:58.000
So, alright, moving on to one more story tonight.

02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:06.000
I can't believe this, but if you're in Finland, you've got some weird taste, that's all I gotta say.

02:45:06.000 --> 02:45:08.000
No offense, but you guys have some weird taste.

02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:10.000
Does it say panties?

02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:13.000
No, well, yes, but it means something different in Finnish.

02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:19.000
Anyway, she's referring to what is written on the can for Angry Birds Soda.

02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:22.000
You know, Angry Birds has been licensed for everything.

02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:28.000
I'm sure there's Angry Birds diapers at this point and whatever, even here in America.

02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:33.000
But, over in Finland, they have Angry Birds Soda, and here's the crazy thing about it.

02:45:33.000 --> 02:45:39.000
It's actually outselling Coke and Pepsi in Finland.

02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:41.000
What?

02:45:42.000 --> 02:45:44.000
Alright, then.

02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:50.000
Peter Vesterbakka from Rovio says that the soda will make its way to Australia and New Zealand in the near future.

02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:55.000
And they say it will probably come to the US eventually as well.

02:45:55.000 --> 02:46:00.000
So, could Angry Birds someday outsell Coke and Pepsi here in America?

02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:02.000
I can only hope it's smelt flavored.

02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:04.000
In Alabama, everything is a Coke.

02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:06.000
It doesn't matter what drink it is, it's Coke.

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:07.000
So, I doubt it.

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:09.000
Unless you're in the Midwest, then it becomes pop.

02:46:09.000 --> 02:46:10.000
Everything's pop.

02:46:10.000 --> 02:46:11.000
Oh, I hate that.

02:46:11.000 --> 02:46:12.000
Oh, it's like nails on chalkboard.

02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:13.000
I hate pop.

02:46:13.000 --> 02:46:14.000
I hate...

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:15.000
Pop is what you do to bubblegum.

02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:16.000
Not soda.

02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:18.000
How about soda pop?

02:46:18.000 --> 02:46:19.000
No!

02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:24.000
Soda pop was the name of one of the boxers in the original Punch Out.

02:46:24.000 --> 02:46:27.000
And that's where it stays.

02:46:27.000 --> 02:46:35.000
It's gonna be weird one of these days when Mario becomes less recognizable to Red Bird.

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:37.000
Give the birds fucking names!

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:38.000
I mean, seriously.

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:39.000
They're just...

02:46:39.000 --> 02:46:43.000
It's gonna continue a trend of streamlining the shape and the name to the point where

02:46:43.000 --> 02:46:47.000
it's just gonna be a dot on the screen and it will be because it's, you know, spelling

02:46:47.000 --> 02:46:49.000
the entire word is tiring.

02:46:49.000 --> 02:46:55.000
The Skype line is now open at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is ORANGELOUNGERADIO,

02:46:55.000 --> 02:46:57.000
all one word.

02:46:57.000 --> 02:47:01.000
Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, ORANGELOUNGERADIO, all one word.

02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:03.000
The Skype line is open.

02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:04.000
And there you go, Nintendo.

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:08.000
Nintendo, you could totally rip off Angry Birds by creating Bullet Bills and then having,

02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:14.000
you know, its own game, you know, where you're just firing Bullet Bills and have them, I

02:47:14.000 --> 02:47:17.000
don't know, do something.

02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:19.000
You can combat this.

02:47:19.000 --> 02:47:22.000
Any last minute stories while we wait for some calls to come in?

02:47:22.000 --> 02:47:24.000
I'll get to the Twitters in a minute, but...

02:47:24.000 --> 02:47:27.000
Yeah, actually there was a few things coming out of MineCon because that just happened

02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:28.000
this weekend.

02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:29.000
Oh, was that this weekend?

02:47:29.000 --> 02:47:30.000
Yes, it was.

02:47:30.000 --> 02:47:32.000
Oh, well hold that thought because we got a call coming in.

02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:33.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:47:33.000 --> 02:47:34.000
Who's this?

02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:40.000
Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Launch Radio.

02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:42.000
I think you're muted.

02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:44.000
Hello, hello.

02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:46.000
One more time.

02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:48.000
Oh, you got to call it.

02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:49.000
Go one, two, three.

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:50.000
All right.

02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:51.000
Let's try another call.

02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:52.000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:47:52.000 --> 02:47:53.000
Who's this?

02:47:53.000 --> 02:47:55.000
Hey, this is Duke Newcomb.

02:47:55.000 --> 02:48:00.000
I was wondering what's your guys' favorite Thanksgiving item because I don't think it's

02:48:00.000 --> 02:48:02.000
been mentioned yet this episode.

02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:07.000
Duke Newcomb wants to know what is everybody's favorite Thanksgiving item because we haven't

02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000
mentioned it yet this episode.

02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:10.000
What a good question.

02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:13.000
I'm so happy it has absolutely nothing to do with video games, but we like to take a

02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:14.000
break once in a while.

02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:18.000
What's more important than video games, Duke Newcomb?

02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:19.000
Food.

02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:20.000
Food.

02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:21.000
That's the answer.

02:48:21.000 --> 02:48:22.000
What did you say?

02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:23.000
Never mind.

02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:24.000
You said what?

02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:28.000
I said what's more important than video games, Duke Newcomb?

02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:29.000
Pie.

02:48:29.000 --> 02:48:30.000
No, the answer is pie.

02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:32.000
No, the answer is cocks.

02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:33.000
Yeah.

02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:34.000
All right.

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:35.000
All right.

02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:36.000
Let's go around and get everybody's...

02:48:36.000 --> 02:48:37.000
Sorry, my phone is going out.

02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:38.000
That's all right.

02:48:38.000 --> 02:48:39.000
That's all right.

02:48:39.000 --> 02:48:40.000
We'll go around and get everybody's answers here for you.

02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:43.000
So what is everybody's favorite Thanksgiving item?

02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:44.000
Dark Sakura.

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:45.000
Garrus.

02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:46.000
Cooked Garrus?

02:48:46.000 --> 02:48:47.000
No.

02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:48.000
Oh, cooked?

02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:51.000
Calibrated to a crisp brown...

02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:56.000
You know, it has to be actually the chocolate chip pumpkin pie that Becky helped me make.

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000
Chocolate chip pumpkin pie.

02:48:58.000 --> 02:48:59.000
It was epic.

02:48:59.000 --> 02:49:00.000
All right.

02:49:00.000 --> 02:49:01.000
All right.

02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:02.000
Rachel.

02:49:02.000 --> 02:49:03.000
Turkey skin.

02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:04.000
Wait, what?

02:49:04.000 --> 02:49:05.000
Duke Newcomb?

02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:09.000
Somebody has to claim the bacon-wrapped turkey.

02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:11.000
Yes, that's right.

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:12.000
All right.

02:49:12.000 --> 02:49:13.000
That's just nasty.

02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:14.000
Swanson, yes.

02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:15.000
I'm sorry.

02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:18.000
And one more time, Rachel, because I got distracted by you.

02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:20.000
It's turkey skin.

02:49:20.000 --> 02:49:21.000
Turkey skin.

02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:25.000
You have to say it like that, because otherwise, what is even the point?

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:26.000
All right.

02:49:26.000 --> 02:49:27.000
Loki.

02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:28.000
Mashed potatoes.

02:49:28.000 --> 02:49:29.000
Mashed potatoes.

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:30.000
Are we good mashed potatoes?

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:33.000
But the Swanson sounds awesome.

02:49:33.000 --> 02:49:34.000
All right.

02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:39.000
My answer is the pumpkin mousse dessert that Allen makes.

02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:43.000
And there might be some in the fridge right now for after the show.

02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:44.000
Just saying.

02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:45.000
So there you go.

02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:46.000
Those are our answers.

02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:51.000
What's your favorite Thanksgiving food, Duke Newcomb?

02:49:51.000 --> 02:49:52.000
Yams.

02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:54.000
Yams and pumpkin pie.

02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:55.000
I don't know why.

02:49:55.000 --> 02:50:02.000
It's just like they have this sweet yet sour kind of flavor, the way my grandma makes them.

02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:04.000
She puts a little bit of lemon juice in there.

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:08.000
It's just like this thing that you don't have any other day of the year.

02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:09.000
And you always look forward to it.

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:13.000
Just that one dish is worth the other 364 days.

02:50:13.000 --> 02:50:15.000
That's a really sweet, sentimental answer.

02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:20.000
But I can tell that you're an imposter, Duke Newcomb, because the real Duke Newcomb would have said,

02:50:21.000 --> 02:50:25.000
My favorite Thanksgiving food is kicking ass.

02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:26.000
No.

02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:28.000
His favorite Thanksgiving food would be bubble gum.

02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:30.000
He would be chewing it.

02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:33.000
The one day of the year he actually gets to chew gum.

02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:34.000
All right.

02:50:34.000 --> 02:50:37.000
Any other thoughts for the listeners before I let you go?

02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:38.000
No.

02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000
Just happy holidays, you guys.

02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:42.000
And keep on listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:50:42.000 --> 02:50:43.000
I love this show.

02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:45.000
We will keep listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:46.000
You too.

02:50:46.000 --> 02:50:49.000
I don't listen to this damn thing anybody else in the show says.

02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:50.000
I'm sorry.

02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:51.000
What's that?

02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:56.000
He said the listeners, not the people who are putting it out there, of course.

02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:57.000
Not you guys.

02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:58.000
You guys are the hosts.

02:50:58.000 --> 02:50:59.000
Fine.

02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:00.000
I'll stop listening.

02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:01.000
Seriously.

02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:02.000
Fuck those guys.

02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:03.000
All right.

02:51:03.000 --> 02:51:04.000
No.

02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:05.000
We really appreciate it, Duke Newcomb.

02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:06.000
Thank you.

02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:07.000
Thanks for the question and take care.

02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:08.000
Yeah.

02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:09.000
Take care.

02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:10.000
Bye.

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:11.000
You know what?

02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:12.000
It's fun to get a non-gaming question once in a while.

02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:16.000
It says politicians are the weeds of the galaxy for ten bucks.

02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:18.000
I want one.

02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:19.000
1877 game OLR.

02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:22.000
Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:51:22.000 --> 02:51:23.000
So, MineCon, Loki.

02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:24.000
Yes.

02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:26.000
So, there's a few things from MineCon.

02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:31.000
First off, there's some details about patch update 1.4 or 1.5.

02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:34.000
And that's going to be called the Redstone update.

02:51:34.000 --> 02:51:36.000
It's supposed to be coming out in January.

02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:41.000
And some of the features they're going to be adding are analog Redstone switches,

02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:42.000
which is kind of cool.

02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:44.000
They're going to be doing some tweaks.

02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:46.000
They're going to have a new capacitor block.

02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:50.000
Also, they're saying variable signal strength stuff,

02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:53.000
as well as some additions to the minecarts,

02:51:53.000 --> 02:51:56.000
ways to link minecarts together.

02:51:56.000 --> 02:51:58.000
Also, they're saying they're going to have a special block

02:51:58.000 --> 02:52:01.000
that's going to allow people to dump off cargo.

02:52:01.000 --> 02:52:04.000
It sounds like a lot of stuff that are kind of inspired by Tekkit,

02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:08.000
where they're going to have piping systems for you moving stuff to chests

02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:10.000
and that kind of thing.

02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:12.000
Pretty cool.

02:52:12.000 --> 02:52:17.000
And also some new Nether-based ore that I guess will be used to make capacitors.

02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:19.000
All right, let me hold that thought while we go to the phones.

02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:20.000
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio.

02:52:20.000 --> 02:52:21.000
Who's this?

02:52:23.000 --> 02:52:25.000
This is the dead call again.

02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:26.000
I think you're muted.

02:52:26.000 --> 02:52:27.000
Hello?

02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:28.000
Hello?

02:52:28.000 --> 02:52:30.000
Hello?

02:52:30.000 --> 02:52:31.000
Goodbye.

02:52:31.000 --> 02:52:33.000
Let's try another one here.

02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:34.000
Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio.

02:52:34.000 --> 02:52:35.000
Who's this?

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:36.000
This is the one and only Ranma.

02:52:36.000 --> 02:52:37.000
Hey, Ranma.

02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:38.000
I'm a good runmer.

02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:41.000
Ermahger Uche.

02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:43.000
How you doing, Ranma?

02:52:43.000 --> 02:52:48.000
Alive, awake, stuffed, and full.

02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:50.000
Full of what?

02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:52.000
Ermahger Thanksgiving dinner.

02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:58.000
What's your favorite Thanksgiving meal or Thanksgiving dish?

02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:00.000
Sweet potato pie.

02:53:00.000 --> 02:53:01.000
Sweet potatoes.

02:53:01.000 --> 02:53:02.000
Oh, lovely.

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:03.000
Sweet potatoes.

02:53:03.000 --> 02:53:06.000
Our Friendsgiving had mashed sweet potatoes.

02:53:06.000 --> 02:53:07.000
Good stuff.

02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:10.000
So what's on your mind, buddy?

02:53:10.000 --> 02:53:11.000
Why'd you call?

02:53:11.000 --> 02:53:17.000
Well, first off, in response to talking about eating Oreos earlier, I can't eat one.

02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:19.000
It's considered cannibalism.

02:53:19.000 --> 02:53:21.000
Do not repeat the joke you made in chat.

02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:23.000
I don't want an explicit tag this week.

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.000
I'll leave it just like that.

02:53:25.000 --> 02:53:27.000
All right.

02:53:27.000 --> 02:53:30.000
I know, this is a PG-13 podcast.

02:53:30.000 --> 02:53:31.000
Yes, yes, exactly.

02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:32.000
Well, what else is on your mind?

02:53:32.000 --> 02:53:36.000
However, I'll allow you to say it if you get me that $65 Garris figure.

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:38.000
Don't listen to her.

02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:43.000
You have to talk to my accountant right now, so yeah.

02:53:43.000 --> 02:53:47.000
So what's going on in your gaming world, Ranma?

02:53:47.000 --> 02:53:50.000
Not too much.

02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:53.000
The only game I've been doing has been on my tablet.

02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:57.000
And I was checking eBay on Saturday and I'm like, wow.

02:53:57.000 --> 02:54:02.000
I really kind of feel bad for those people who sit on those long lines to grab a Wii U

02:54:02.000 --> 02:54:04.000
just to flip it because you know what?

02:54:04.000 --> 02:54:06.000
That was going to be me.

02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:10.000
I ain't got pity in the world for those people.

02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:17.000
Even if you had done it yourself, Ranma, I would have said, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

02:54:17.000 --> 02:54:18.000
Hey, Ranma.

02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:19.000
Yes.

02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:20.000
Ha.

02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:27.000
Because the most expensive one I saw was $405 with 70 bids.

02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:28.000
Wow.

02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:36.000
Well, I mean, it's just either people are resisting or it's not that hard to come by right now.

02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:40.000
You can still find basics on shelves in some places and some people are just saying,

02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:43.000
you know what, I'd rather buy a basic than buy from an eBay flipper.

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:44.000
I know.

02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:52.000
And I remember during the whole Wii U sales, they were going as high as $2,500, $3,000.

02:54:52.000 --> 02:55:02.000
And I saw ads where you would get Wii, all the released games, 5.1 surround sound system, 50 inch LCD TV.

02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:07.000
I'll dress up as Santa and bring it to your house and deliver it for your kids on Christmas day.

02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:10.000
Good lord, how much did that go for?

02:55:10.000 --> 02:55:13.000
Those were going as high as $3,000.

02:55:13.000 --> 02:55:16.000
That's not a bad deal for all that shit.

02:55:16.000 --> 02:55:20.000
I expect to see something like that run the holidays for the Wii U.

02:55:20.000 --> 02:55:24.000
Rama, will you dress up as Santa and come over to my house and give out the presents?

02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:29.000
Does it come with full release?

02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:30.000
Wow.

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:37.000
Does my visit from Santa come with a happy ending?

02:55:37.000 --> 02:55:40.000
Rob, that was bad and you should feel bad.

02:55:40.000 --> 02:55:42.000
I do.

02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:43.000
It ain't black Santa.

02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:48.000
It's Mary Kwanzaa, fool.

02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:52.000
I pity the fool that don't like candles.

02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:53.000
How's that?

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:54.000
Close enough.

02:55:54.000 --> 02:55:56.000
It's time for me to wear my Mary Kwanzaa bitches shirt again.

02:55:56.000 --> 02:56:01.000
How about I send you over to Jamie's house on Christmas because that would be hilarious.

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:07.000
If you send me to Jamie's house for Christmas, I might not leave because you know she has that Southern cooking I love.

02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:09.000
You know I can do it too.

02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:15.000
I will make grits and mashed potatoes.

02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:28.000
I'm not going to totally advertise this to all the listeners everywhere, but Alan and I have been talking about starting a new Christmas tradition out of the one we started last year.

02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:33.000
And that is taking our Jewish friends to Asian food on Christmas.

02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:34.000
That's right, we did that.

02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:35.000
We did that last year.

02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:37.000
We went out for pho, didn't we?

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:40.000
Yeah, we didn't. So Alan and I want to extend that again this year.

02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:41.000
I'm down for that.

02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:43.000
We might try to get some other people to come along this year.

02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:44.000
We even sort of made a half joke.

02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:50.000
Two gay men and a Jew walk into a Vietnamese restaurant.

02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:53.000
It's a new sitcom. Two gay men and a Jew at a Vietnamese restaurant.

02:56:53.000 --> 02:56:56.000
I don't know the punchline, but there's one in there somewhere.

02:56:56.000 --> 02:57:01.000
Jumas has been a long-timing tradition in my house for the last seven years.

02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:02.000
Chris Maquanzica.

02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:04.000
There you go.

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:05.000
There you go.

02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:06.000
All right, Rama.

02:57:06.000 --> 02:57:07.000
I was calling it holiday mass.

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.000
Mary Festivus to you.

02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:11.000
The rest of us.

02:57:11.000 --> 02:57:12.000
The rest of us.

02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:15.000
If there's nothing else, then I'm going to let you go.

02:57:15.000 --> 02:57:16.000
Works for me.

02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:17.000
All right, take care, buddy.

02:57:17.000 --> 02:57:18.000
Later.

02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:19.000
Bye.

02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:21.000
I'm telling you guys, the Oreo joke was really bad.

02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:23.000
All right, that's going to do it for the Skypline.

02:57:23.000 --> 02:57:25.000
We're running way over three hours tonight, so I'm going to wrap it up.

02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:27.000
Sorry to those that didn't get through, but if you didn't get through,

02:57:27.000 --> 02:57:29.000
you should send us an email.

02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:32.000
Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.

02:57:32.000 --> 02:57:35.000
Or you can always send us a tweet or any of that stuff.

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:37.000
I want to let Loki finish up the last minute stories.

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:38.000
All right.

02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:39.000
I've got to get to Twitter topics, too.

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:40.000
One last thing.

02:57:40.000 --> 02:57:44.000
There was another app that was announced called Minecraft Reality.

02:57:44.000 --> 02:57:48.000
It's an augmented reality app for iOS,

02:57:48.000 --> 02:57:51.000
and it can display 3D Minecraft images in the real world,

02:57:51.000 --> 02:57:53.000
and you can walk around them and stuff.

02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:56.000
It looked pretty cool from the little trailer that they had.

02:57:56.000 --> 02:57:58.000
You can check that out.

02:57:58.000 --> 02:58:01.000
It's two bucks to download.

02:58:01.000 --> 02:58:03.000
All right.

02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:05.000
I actually have a last minute story because this just finished

02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:07.000
while we were doing the show tonight.

02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:10.000
The Kickstarter for the Shadow Gate reboot has ended,

02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:12.000
and they made it.

02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:15.000
So the Shadow Gate reimagining is going to be happening.

02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:17.000
Which one?

02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:19.000
The one that we talked about.

02:58:19.000 --> 02:58:20.000
Oh, Shadow Gate. I'm sorry.

02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:22.000
Shadow Gate, not Shadow Run.

02:58:22.000 --> 02:58:23.000
How many of those do they have?

02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:26.000
The old school NES game and Mac game from back in the day,

02:58:26.000 --> 02:58:27.000
deja vu, et cetera.

02:58:27.000 --> 02:58:30.000
Not only did they make their $120,000 for the base game,

02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:33.000
but they made their first stretch goal of $130,000,

02:58:33.000 --> 02:58:36.000
meaning they're going to expand on the castle

02:58:36.000 --> 02:58:40.000
and add some rooms and puzzles, 15% more game.

02:58:40.000 --> 02:58:42.000
So pretty cool.

02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:46.000
Congratulations to the team there who make Shadow Gate.

02:58:46.000 --> 02:58:48.000
Let's get to the Twitter topics.

02:58:48.000 --> 02:58:50.000
I'm really excited about that Shadow Gate reboot, though.

02:58:50.000 --> 02:58:53.000
Actually, that's only the second Kickstarter I've ever given to.

02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:56.000
So I've done GamerCon, and I did that one.

02:58:56.000 --> 02:58:58.000
So we'll see.

02:58:58.000 --> 02:59:00.000
There's part of me that wants to give to the Molyneux project,

02:59:00.000 --> 02:59:03.000
but then I'm like, that guy is such a...

02:59:03.000 --> 02:59:06.000
The advertisement, again, really, really turned me off a little bit.

02:59:06.000 --> 02:59:08.000
All right.

02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:09.000
Let's see.

02:59:09.000 --> 02:59:13.000
Going to some tweets.

02:59:13.000 --> 02:59:15.000
Twitter.com slash O-L-R.

02:59:15.000 --> 02:59:17.000
ActDeft wants to remind us the Gold Nunchuck

02:59:17.000 --> 02:59:20.000
will make its return to Club Nintendo tomorrow.

02:59:20.000 --> 02:59:22.000
900 points for the Golden Nunchuck,

02:59:22.000 --> 02:59:24.000
because they need to get rid of them.

02:59:24.000 --> 02:59:26.000
I really need this in my life, Rob.

02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:27.000
You don't understand.

02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:28.000
What, the Golden Nunchuck?

02:59:28.000 --> 02:59:29.000
No.

02:59:29.000 --> 02:59:30.000
What?

02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:33.000
The Garris figure that's...

02:59:33.000 --> 02:59:35.000
A sex doll.

02:59:35.000 --> 02:59:37.000
Hm?

02:59:37.000 --> 02:59:38.000
That's what?

02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:39.000
A sex doll.

02:59:39.000 --> 02:59:40.000
No.

02:59:40.000 --> 02:59:42.000
It's...

02:59:42.000 --> 02:59:47.000
Someone linked it to me for cheaper.

02:59:47.000 --> 02:59:48.000
All right.

02:59:48.000 --> 02:59:49.000
And let's see.

02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:53.000
Moving on to the next tweet from Tigerclaw.

02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:55.000
Oh, I did read about this.

02:59:55.000 --> 03:00:00.000
007 Legends studio Eurocom laid off a big chunk of its staff this week,

03:00:00.000 --> 03:00:04.000
and he links us to a story I'm trying to bring up right now.

03:00:04.000 --> 03:00:08.000
The Eurocom studio, which is based in the UK,

03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:12.000
laid off the majority of its workforce as part of restructuring.

03:00:12.000 --> 03:00:14.000
The studio has been around since 88.

03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:16.000
Yeah, they made a lot of games besides just this,

03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:17.000
but that's...

03:00:17.000 --> 03:00:20.000
They also did 007 Reloaded and then, of course, Legends,

03:00:20.000 --> 03:00:22.000
which wasn't very well received, unfortunately.

03:00:22.000 --> 03:00:25.000
Eurocom director Hugh Binns said that, quote,

03:00:25.000 --> 03:00:27.000
Eurocom are undertaking a restructuring,

03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:30.000
which I regret to say has meant we've made the majority of our workforce

03:00:30.000 --> 03:00:31.000
redundant today.

03:00:31.000 --> 03:00:33.000
That's the British word for laying off.

03:00:33.000 --> 03:00:37.000
This includes many very experienced, talented, and highly skilled employees,

03:00:37.000 --> 03:00:41.000
and we'd like to thank them all for your hard work and efforts.

03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:44.000
And they say this is because of the decline in the video game market.

03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:47.000
The studio had to cancel a number of projects.

03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:49.000
That sucks.

03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:53.000
And lastly, SSJ100Matt sends us a tweet about,

03:00:53.000 --> 03:00:56.000
we all know playing games while driving is a terrible idea,

03:00:56.000 --> 03:00:59.000
but one game is trying to change that.

03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:03.000
BrightDriver is what it's called.

03:01:03.000 --> 03:01:05.000
It's an iPhone app called BrightDriver.

03:01:05.000 --> 03:01:09.000
It's a platform that supports audio games people play in the car

03:01:09.000 --> 03:01:13.000
to keep their attention from lagging during long rides.

03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:16.000
It uses GPS functionality to keep track of the user's driving

03:01:16.000 --> 03:01:20.000
using metrics like speed, break rate, and stressful conditions like traffic,

03:01:20.000 --> 03:01:24.000
and the games modify their pace appropriately.

03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:26.000
That is crazy.

03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:30.000
That's kind of cool, like an audio game that you interact with.

03:01:30.000 --> 03:01:32.000
I want to hear more about this.

03:01:32.000 --> 03:01:34.000
I'll have to read the rest of the story for a future week,

03:01:34.000 --> 03:01:36.000
but that sounds kind of cool.

03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:40.000
So that's it for the tweets tonight at twitter.com slash O-L-R.

03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:44.000
And this means we're at the end of the show.

03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:48.000
Rachel, thank you very much for coming to the show tonight.

03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:49.000
Thank you for having me.

03:01:49.000 --> 03:01:51.000
And sitting in. Come back any time.

03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:52.000
I surely will.

03:01:52.000 --> 03:01:54.000
And we'll talk to you again.

03:01:54.000 --> 03:01:57.000
It may have taken you 480 episodes to get here,

03:01:57.000 --> 03:01:59.000
but it doesn't look like we're going to go anywhere any time soon.

03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:01.000
Duke Nukem told us we need to keep listening,

03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:03.000
so I guess we're here for a little while.

03:02:03.000 --> 03:02:06.000
Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:10.000
Yeah.

03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:11.000
Yeah.

03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:12.000
Quick plug?

03:02:12.000 --> 03:02:13.000
Sure, of course.

03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:15.000
Greetings from the wasteland at WordPress.

03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:19.000
I do creepypasta, and I do write about video games occasionally.

03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:21.000
There you go. Awesome.

03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:25.000
Um, Loki, any last thoughts, final thoughts from you tonight?

03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:28.000
I just, I don't know.

03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:31.000
Hopefully we'll be playing some Black Ops 2 multiplayer this week,

03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:33.000
aside from just, you know, myself and my coworker.

03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:34.000
Alrighty.

03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:36.000
Uh, DarkSagra.

03:02:36.000 --> 03:02:39.000
Someone really needs to get me the Geras figure.

03:02:39.000 --> 03:02:40.000
I'm not even kidding.

03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:42.000
Does it come with full release?

03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:46.000
Yeah, does it come with Tumblr rendered vajay?

03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:47.000
Alright.

03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:49.000
And, uh, my final thought tonight, as always,

03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:52.000
thank you all for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:55.000
If you enjoyed the show, please tell a friend or two or 20 about the show.

03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:58.000
Help us spread the word, because we don't have any major websites behind us.

03:02:58.000 --> 03:03:02.000
Or, I mean, we have the VoG network, but let's be real,

03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:05.000
it's not exactly a 1UP.com or a giant bomb.

03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:07.000
So, uh, you know, help spread the word.

03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:09.000
A website that generates revenue.

03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:10.000
Exactly, exactly.

03:03:10.000 --> 03:03:11.000
It's a fun project.

03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:12.000
But you know what?

03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:14.000
There are more great shows on VoG.

03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:15.000
It is not just us.

03:03:15.000 --> 03:03:17.000
There are lots and lots of great shows on VoG.

03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:20.000
Bobby Black Wolf before us, Sunday nights.

03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:23.000
Uh, Understation Live on Saturday nights.

03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:27.000
Mondays are full of Pod Culture, British Invaders, and Critical Myth.

03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:30.000
Critical Myth, the hardworking guys, they're on three times a week on the network.

03:03:30.000 --> 03:03:32.000
Anime Jam session on Tuesday.

03:03:32.000 --> 03:03:35.000
Uh, Girls Gone Wow on Wednesday.

03:03:35.000 --> 03:03:37.000
And Horde House, they're okay.

03:03:37.000 --> 03:03:38.000
Also on Wednesday.

03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:40.000
So, there you go, yes.

03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:42.000
As Black Wolf says in chat, VoG network.

03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:44.000
It's a website.

03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:46.000
That's a good final thought.

03:03:46.000 --> 03:03:48.000
It's a website.

03:03:48.000 --> 03:03:49.000
We'll see you next time.

03:03:49.000 --> 03:03:51.000
On our website.

03:03:51.000 --> 03:03:52.000
Have a good night, everybody.

03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:53.000
Bye.

03:03:54.000 --> 03:03:57.000
