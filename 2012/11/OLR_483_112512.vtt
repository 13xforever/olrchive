00:14.184 --> 00:19.627
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, November 25, 2012, could a new scaled-down Xbox 360 be on the way?

00:19.987 --> 00:24.950
[SPEAKER_01]: Sony's credit rating is reduced, and Japan bans the sale of a controversial cartridge.

00:31.707 --> 00:36.791
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:36.851 --> 00:43.936
[SPEAKER_04]: It is Orange Lounge Radio live with this episode number 483 for November the 25th of 2012.

00:44.997 --> 00:52.963
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here to talk to you guys about video games and what's going on in gaming culture and so forth with my co-host.

00:53.343 --> 00:56.626
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello first off to the one, the only, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:56.846 --> 00:58.267
[SPEAKER_10]: You should really watch where that glass is.

00:58.987 --> 01:00.348
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, with the mic cords and everything?

01:01.649 --> 01:04.731
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't want to knock it off and then onto your knee and have you curse loudly.

01:04.771 --> 01:07.052
[SPEAKER_10]: Although that might have been funny, but it would have been very poor radio.

01:07.112 --> 01:07.352
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

01:07.832 --> 01:09.253
[SPEAKER_04]: Broken glass going into my foot.

01:09.413 --> 01:10.654
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a good radio time.

01:10.994 --> 01:12.475
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but it would have been hilarious here.

01:12.855 --> 01:13.155
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:13.195 --> 01:13.536
[SPEAKER_04]: Not really.

01:14.136 --> 01:15.096
[SPEAKER_04]: Heart, heart, heart, heart.

01:15.277 --> 01:17.778
[SPEAKER_04]: Also say hello less, or what is it?

01:17.898 --> 01:19.679
[SPEAKER_04]: Less than slash three.

01:19.819 --> 01:20.039
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

01:21.520 --> 01:23.601
[SPEAKER_04]: Also say hello to Techmaster Loki.

01:23.761 --> 01:24.021
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

01:24.262 --> 01:24.882
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you, Loki?

01:25.102 --> 01:25.342
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

01:25.822 --> 01:26.182
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:26.343 --> 01:26.963
[SPEAKER_04]: What's new with you?

01:28.163 --> 01:28.544
[SPEAKER_04]: Not much.

01:28.564 --> 01:29.344
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have a good holiday?

01:29.644 --> 01:30.485
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was fun.

01:30.585 --> 01:31.025
[SPEAKER_04]: Eat a lot?

01:31.565 --> 01:31.765
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

01:32.085 --> 01:32.326
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

01:32.426 --> 01:32.946
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times.

01:33.026 --> 01:36.528
[SPEAKER_10]: I read about the adventures of your child sitting under the tree eating spaghetti.

01:38.088 --> 01:39.029
[SPEAKER_04]: A spaghetti Thanksgiving?

01:39.528 --> 01:40.529
[SPEAKER_10]: Nelly posted something.

01:40.569 --> 01:41.730
[SPEAKER_04]: How does that work?

01:41.790 --> 01:43.793
[SPEAKER_10]: Or eating some food under the tree.

01:43.853 --> 01:44.393
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe turkey?

01:44.533 --> 01:45.735
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:45.835 --> 01:49.679
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, also say hello to the ever-present fourth guest in our chat room.

01:50.500 --> 01:58.368
[SPEAKER_04]: Live.VogNetwork.com is the place to be where you can read comments such as Jason, who says, Rob sounds particularly more energetic tonight.

01:58.908 --> 02:01.131
[SPEAKER_04]: And Brad from PodCulture says, probably lots of coffee.

02:01.511 --> 02:02.051
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

02:02.231 --> 02:03.552
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, four cups today.

02:03.792 --> 02:04.752
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

02:04.832 --> 02:05.252
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo-hoo.

02:05.552 --> 02:07.432
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we do have another guest joining us in studio.

02:07.973 --> 02:09.013
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody new to the show.

02:09.293 --> 02:12.994
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you believe there's still people in Sacramento who play video games who haven't been on this show?

02:13.954 --> 02:15.534
[SPEAKER_04]: But we do have somebody new to the show tonight.

02:15.554 --> 02:17.455
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you have a nickname you'd like to go by.

02:17.475 --> 02:19.055
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you want me to introduce you as tonight?

02:20.195 --> 02:22.196
[SPEAKER_12]: WordPress handle is Rakshasarani.

02:22.956 --> 02:24.957
[SPEAKER_04]: Rock Shas, are you a Kingdom Hearts girl?

02:25.177 --> 02:26.377
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that where Rock Shas comes from?

02:26.517 --> 02:28.618
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, it's Rock Shasa Rani.

02:28.658 --> 02:32.479
[SPEAKER_12]: It basically translates to Ogre Queen, but I'm sure it's improperly conjugated.

02:32.659 --> 02:33.779
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's all right.

02:34.059 --> 02:35.420
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hello and welcome to the show.

02:35.520 --> 02:36.960
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't expect me to be able to repeat that.

02:36.980 --> 02:37.921
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I call you by your first name?

02:38.101 --> 02:38.881
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, go right ahead.

02:38.901 --> 02:40.481
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to call you Rachel because that's what your name is.

02:41.102 --> 02:41.802
[SPEAKER_04]: So hi, Rachel.

02:41.842 --> 02:42.542
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the show.

02:43.222 --> 02:44.043
[SPEAKER_12]: Not Indian at all.

02:44.223 --> 02:46.265
[SPEAKER_12]: But we could go Rachel.

02:47.366 --> 02:50.548
[SPEAKER_04]: A good plug for your WordPress right at the top of the show.

02:51.609 --> 02:54.011
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way to sell your site here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:54.592 --> 02:56.653
[SPEAKER_04]: So, welcome to the show.

02:56.753 --> 02:59.215
[SPEAKER_04]: You and Jamie go to school together or something like that, right?

02:59.255 --> 03:00.697
[SPEAKER_10]: We slave away on the magazine together.

03:00.877 --> 03:01.998
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, good times.

03:02.038 --> 03:05.901
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and we're both kind of subbing on the other side pretty much.

03:06.421 --> 03:12.186
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I always felt more part of the writing process, but this year I'm on the design team, whereas...

03:12.526 --> 03:15.549
[SPEAKER_12]: Jamie, who is an excellent designer, is now on the English side of it.

03:15.789 --> 03:17.510
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so we're sort of crossed over.

03:18.191 --> 03:23.695
[SPEAKER_10]: But that means we both see what goes on on each side and then go, what's up with that?

03:25.396 --> 03:28.158
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys are frenzies from school.

03:28.279 --> 03:33.483
[SPEAKER_04]: So how did you guys, obviously you guys connected because you're both obviously geeky gals, which is great.

03:33.523 --> 03:34.303
[SPEAKER_04]: We love geeky gals.

03:34.964 --> 03:36.285
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you guys kind of find that connection?

03:37.751 --> 03:56.672
[SPEAKER_10]: through many rides home and series of conversations and yarn which I'm working on during the show again more crochet you were mentioning earlier that you are very experienced with yarn and all that stuff and she's a fantastic potter oh thank you

03:57.032 --> 04:03.498
[SPEAKER_12]: and that's really my only contribution to the yarn store is because my mother's more of a crocheter, my sister knits.

04:03.978 --> 04:10.164
[SPEAKER_12]: I do these things called yarn bowls and basically it's just, you know, yarn accessories works out pretty well for me.

04:10.224 --> 04:15.128
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, all this talk about knitting and crocheting and pottery is going to go over great with our teen male audience, but...

04:16.509 --> 04:17.210
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, boys.

04:19.491 --> 04:21.132
[SPEAKER_04]: I play games and I do pottery.

04:22.212 --> 04:23.513
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about games for a minute.

04:23.553 --> 04:24.694
[SPEAKER_08]: Do pottery, not pot.

04:25.774 --> 04:29.357
[SPEAKER_04]: We were talking a little bit before the show and you mentioned you have a love of Silent Hill.

04:29.777 --> 04:30.857
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yes, yes.

04:31.318 --> 04:33.619
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is very fond for us here at OLR.

04:34.199 --> 04:35.320
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your favorite out of the series?

04:36.292 --> 04:38.733
[SPEAKER_12]: Ooh, it's kind of a toss-up.

04:40.493 --> 04:42.574
[SPEAKER_12]: I kind of like 3 and 4.

04:43.514 --> 04:47.215
[SPEAKER_12]: I love 4 for its story more than its gameplay aspects.

04:47.375 --> 04:47.755
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

04:47.775 --> 04:49.455
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't hear a lot of people sticking up for 4.

04:49.615 --> 04:52.776
[SPEAKER_04]: I think 4 was better than people say it was.

04:52.936 --> 04:53.556
[SPEAKER_04]: It was intriguing.

04:53.616 --> 04:54.817
[SPEAKER_04]: But weird that you didn't say 2.

04:56.684 --> 04:57.184
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

04:57.224 --> 04:57.545
[SPEAKER_12]: Go with that.

04:57.565 --> 04:58.625
[SPEAKER_12]: What other games do you play?

04:58.705 --> 05:00.046
[SPEAKER_12]: What other games do you like?

05:00.066 --> 05:00.887
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you a fan of?

05:14.435 --> 05:15.956
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been playing a lot of Portal recently.

05:16.897 --> 05:20.179
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I love Portal, but it's really on my four-year-old nephew's account, too.

05:20.259 --> 05:26.104
[SPEAKER_12]: He's a huge fan of Portal, too, and that is literally the first thing out of his mouth any time he comes over to visit.

05:26.865 --> 05:29.888
[SPEAKER_12]: So I've got that pretty much, like, I could navigate that in my sleep.

05:30.488 --> 05:31.209
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice, nice.

05:31.249 --> 05:32.690
[SPEAKER_04]: No wonder you and Jamie get along.

05:33.931 --> 05:37.354
[SPEAKER_04]: She would not shut up about Portal until she discovered Mass Effect.

05:38.593 --> 05:40.034
[SPEAKER_10]: So now I've got to get her... Oh, God.

05:40.075 --> 05:41.516
[SPEAKER_04]: Did she suck you into that, too?

05:41.676 --> 05:41.956
[SPEAKER_04]: Not yet.

05:41.976 --> 05:42.937
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been telling her about it.

05:43.117 --> 05:43.838
[SPEAKER_10]: I've got Becky.

05:44.058 --> 05:45.620
[SPEAKER_10]: Becky's already beaten the third game now.

05:47.041 --> 05:47.381
[SPEAKER_10]: Wait a minute.

05:47.962 --> 05:49.143
[SPEAKER_10]: She's playing through Leviathan now.

05:49.463 --> 05:51.285
[SPEAKER_10]: Did Becky play a lot of video games before?

05:51.445 --> 05:51.686
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

05:52.026 --> 05:52.286
[SPEAKER_10]: None.

05:54.348 --> 05:57.631
[SPEAKER_10]: I should tell her that we're talking about her because she's actually making dinner for Julian right now.

05:57.811 --> 05:58.172
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

05:58.272 --> 06:02.276
[SPEAKER_10]: But she's like, I found out that the controllers are ergonomic.

06:02.376 --> 06:03.136
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't hurt.

06:03.156 --> 06:03.617
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

06:04.257 --> 06:06.359
[SPEAKER_10]: So she's been playing through everything on Xbox 360.

06:06.800 --> 06:07.441
[SPEAKER_03]: I figured it out.

06:08.341 --> 06:13.847
[SPEAKER_03]: Mass Effect 3, or Mass Effect the series, is like Fifty Shades of Grey, but a different version of it.

06:14.147 --> 06:15.288
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Fifty Shades of Garrus.

06:15.308 --> 06:16.289
[SPEAKER_03]: Fifty Shades of Garrus!

06:16.349 --> 06:16.549
[SPEAKER_03]: A.K.A.

06:16.609 --> 06:17.210
[SPEAKER_03]: Turian Peen.

06:21.574 --> 06:23.335
[SPEAKER_04]: Shade 1, calibrations.

06:23.996 --> 06:25.977
[SPEAKER_04]: Shade 2, more calibrations.

06:26.818 --> 06:28.299
[SPEAKER_04]: Shade 3, can you come back later?

06:28.339 --> 06:29.580
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to do some calibrations.

06:31.801 --> 06:35.504
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but I'm actually super looking forward to Omega.

06:36.624 --> 06:37.565
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to play Mass Effect.

06:37.985 --> 06:38.786
[SPEAKER_04]: The first one's free.

06:39.086 --> 06:42.310
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com where you can participate.

06:42.870 --> 06:46.374
[SPEAKER_04]: A supporter, Rachel, in the chatroom, Shayna Linko says, yay, someone else likes 4.

06:46.675 --> 06:47.495
[SPEAKER_04]: 4 was awesome.

06:48.136 --> 06:49.097
[SPEAKER_10]: 4 was pretty cool.

06:49.257 --> 06:52.140
[SPEAKER_04]: Shayna's a huge Silent Hill fan, so let's see.

06:52.421 --> 06:55.264
[SPEAKER_04]: And Actdeft, Portal is the most fun, Portal 2 is the best.

06:57.486 --> 06:58.107
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

07:16.390 --> 07:19.132
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about the whole, you know, Shepard, Garrus.

07:19.332 --> 07:21.274
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like first contact with her butt, is it?

07:22.615 --> 07:24.797
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's Turian pain.

07:25.077 --> 07:30.662
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyway, she also did a series of drawings of what she thinks the vag of other species is.

07:30.922 --> 07:31.043
[SPEAKER_10]: Why?

07:31.083 --> 07:33.024
[SPEAKER_11]: Why, why, why?

07:33.525 --> 07:35.486
[SPEAKER_11]: Because inquiring minds want to know.

07:36.607 --> 07:39.350
[SPEAKER_10]: But the thing is, she's actually a super, super good artist.

07:41.656 --> 07:53.440
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's what she spends her talents on so her work is actually rather realistic and it would make like logical sense oh my god I can't did someone say portfolio?

07:55.461 --> 08:09.886
[SPEAKER_04]: anyhow let me bring up another random comment to try and stir this conversation in a different direction I'm going to bring up another game I know you told me about earlier Rachel Brad from PodCulture says ooh Steam has Arkham City for $7.50 that's another game series you said you were into right?

08:10.434 --> 08:11.055
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yes, yes.

08:11.135 --> 08:19.614
[SPEAKER_12]: As a matter of fact, first time I installed Arkham Asylum, I did one complete playthrough throughout two days because I didn't want to have to, you know...

08:21.348 --> 08:44.418
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah I installed it and then I didn't register it or whatever so I couldn't save it so I basically just played the thing for two days straight and then Arkham City came out I played that thing into the ground and like I'm you know I come from a family of completionists so it's like I was in there doing like every single Riddler challenge and oh my god I lost so much sleep it's like I could feel my eyes just ready to fall out of my skull.

08:44.438 --> 08:45.018
[SPEAKER_04]: But you did it!

08:45.558 --> 08:46.879
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you do all the DLC too?

08:47.459 --> 08:49.300
[SPEAKER_12]: No, no, I'm saving those for a special occasion.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.800
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you haven't really finished it.

08:51.000 --> 08:51.681
[SPEAKER_12]: I know.

08:51.721 --> 08:52.521
[SPEAKER_12]: Twitch, Twitch, Twitch.

08:52.541 --> 08:53.801
[SPEAKER_04]: I was trying to see if I could get her to Twitch.

08:54.282 --> 08:56.002
[SPEAKER_12]: Were you a fan of the comics before playing the game?

08:57.063 --> 08:58.143
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, not so much the comics.

08:58.223 --> 09:02.044
[SPEAKER_12]: I got into the games mainly because of the Cartoon Connection.

09:02.544 --> 09:03.845
[SPEAKER_12]: Kevin Conroy, awesome.

09:04.375 --> 09:05.495
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, okay, the animated series.

09:05.696 --> 09:06.016
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

09:06.456 --> 09:10.257
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, him and Mark Hamill, they are basically Batman and the Joker for me.

09:10.437 --> 09:11.858
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all kinds of happies.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.138
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of people on your team when it comes to that.

09:14.579 --> 09:17.440
[SPEAKER_04]: So, awesome.

09:17.540 --> 09:20.141
[SPEAKER_10]: I was mad at the DLC.

09:20.341 --> 09:20.581
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

09:21.441 --> 09:22.521
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't play all the DLC.

09:22.681 --> 09:27.123
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know the thing with... Okay, the game's been out forever, so I'm just going to freaking say it.

09:27.563 --> 09:31.144
[SPEAKER_10]: About Harley... Jump ahead quick if you don't want spoilers.

09:31.164 --> 09:31.665
[SPEAKER_04]: Jump ahead.

09:31.705 --> 09:32.645
[SPEAKER_04]: Mute for one minute.

09:32.825 --> 09:34.186
[SPEAKER_10]: about Harley's pregnancy test.

09:34.846 --> 09:38.248
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, like, in the DLC, there's, like, 20 bajillion of them that are all negative.

09:39.809 --> 09:43.732
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they're trying to fix that for a possible third game or something, maybe.

09:43.792 --> 09:48.214
[SPEAKER_12]: Except, like, there was the ending where she's singing a lullaby, so... Whatever.

09:48.655 --> 09:55.579
[SPEAKER_12]: Or, you know, that would be, like, a defining character moment where she thinks she's pregnant, but she's really gone even crazier, so it's like a...

09:56.139 --> 09:57.440
[SPEAKER_12]: Joker doll that she's calling her.

09:57.660 --> 09:59.801
[SPEAKER_12]: I kind of like if it would move in that direction.

10:01.181 --> 10:01.601
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

10:02.462 --> 10:07.704
[SPEAKER_04]: She sounds like one of those crazy women, like the type that would draw vaginas of alien races and post them on her Tumblr.

10:07.724 --> 10:08.344
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

10:08.644 --> 10:10.165
[SPEAKER_10]: I linked the Tumblr in the chat room.

10:10.325 --> 10:10.805
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, great.

10:10.885 --> 10:11.306
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

10:11.386 --> 10:12.466
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for that.

10:12.546 --> 10:14.047
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure Loki's pulling it up right now.

10:14.987 --> 10:17.308
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

10:17.348 --> 10:23.451
[SPEAKER_10]: For the record, Rob, despite the comic being fairly graphic, it actually is very...

10:24.431 --> 10:24.952
[SPEAKER_04]: It's artsy.

10:25.012 --> 10:25.873
[SPEAKER_10]: It actually tells a story.

10:27.194 --> 10:27.994
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll leave it at that.

10:28.034 --> 10:28.675
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll leave it at that.

10:29.055 --> 10:30.056
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

10:30.376 --> 10:33.299
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have to ask you before we move on to our real kickoff topic.

10:33.359 --> 10:35.781
[SPEAKER_04]: Rachel, what's your gaming platform of choice?

10:36.061 --> 10:39.304
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a particular console you tend to play stuff on or are you more PC gal?

10:39.704 --> 10:40.224
[SPEAKER_04]: Where do you lean?

10:40.705 --> 10:41.185
[SPEAKER_12]: Shiznight.

10:41.866 --> 10:45.929
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I tend to gravitate towards PC just because I'm big on retro games and I

10:46.629 --> 10:48.090
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of emulators available there.

10:48.370 --> 10:49.011
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, I see.

10:49.131 --> 10:55.215
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but if you twist my arm and force me to pick, I'd have to go with a Nintendo console, just out of sheer loyalty.

10:55.906 --> 10:56.807
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, you're one of those.

10:57.067 --> 10:57.567
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just kidding.

10:57.688 --> 10:58.628
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm one of those.

10:58.648 --> 10:59.489
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki will love you!

10:59.509 --> 11:04.032
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want anything wrong with Nintendo consoles.

11:04.933 --> 11:07.475
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, you know, the Wii U is just not worth the money.

11:08.396 --> 11:13.840
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll get into plenty more of that in a minute, but I did want to talk about some other kickoff topics here real quick.

11:14.340 --> 11:19.064
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, we hope all you guys here in the States had a happy Thanksgiving holiday.

11:20.165 --> 11:21.946
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and around the world, hope you had a good week.

11:22.186 --> 11:22.706
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously...

11:23.707 --> 11:25.688
[SPEAKER_04]: retail madness over the weekend.

11:25.728 --> 11:28.429
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of hate that that stuff is starting to eclipse Thanksgiving.

11:28.469 --> 11:30.730
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of people are growing very frustrated with it.

11:31.150 --> 11:34.012
[SPEAKER_04]: But it is the time to get some good deals.

11:34.572 --> 11:37.393
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Steam sale, obviously, is another good place to get deals.

11:38.494 --> 11:42.515
[SPEAKER_04]: Civ V, which I never shut up about on this show, great deal going on right now.

11:42.655 --> 11:45.757
[SPEAKER_04]: I was really tempted to get Borderlands 2, which I know is on sale.

11:46.137 --> 11:50.099
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious if you guys picked up any gaming deals over these past few days.

11:50.559 --> 11:50.899
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes.

11:51.319 --> 11:51.859
[SPEAKER_04]: What'd you get?

11:52.160 --> 11:52.920
[SPEAKER_04]: What'd you get, DarkSakura?

11:53.631 --> 12:15.876
[SPEAKER_10]: I bought They Bleed Pixels and Awesome Knots And then I bought Dragon Age Origins, the Deluxe Edition through Origin Although I wish I had waited and just gotten it through Steam Because Steam was a penny cheaper One whole penny But I hate Origin, I prefer playing through Steam And then I actually just bought Sonic Generations on Steam Because it's eight freaking bucks And it's Sonic Generations

12:16.776 --> 12:19.679
[SPEAKER_10]: with a really screwed up last level, seriously.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.922
[SPEAKER_10]: Because Dan and I sat and watched the whole playthrough.

12:24.163 --> 12:24.403
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

12:25.344 --> 12:27.727
[SPEAKER_04]: Rachel, did you take advantage of any of the gaming deals this weekend?

12:28.067 --> 12:28.547
[SPEAKER_12]: I did not.

12:28.587 --> 12:33.592
[SPEAKER_12]: I was actually working through Black Friday, even though it wasn't really Black Friday-ish for our shop.

12:34.753 --> 12:38.756
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I still saw a bit of ugliness, so I was more preoccupied with the working part of that.

12:39.017 --> 12:40.398
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's fair enough, fair enough.

12:40.438 --> 12:40.858
[SPEAKER_04]: It happens.

12:42.099 --> 12:49.786
[SPEAKER_04]: You brave, brave retail people that had to work those front lines on Friday, I don't envy you in the slightest, because people are crazy.

12:50.206 --> 12:56.868
[SPEAKER_04]: Although, I was telling you guys before the show, I went out on Black Friday at about 8 o'clock at night because we needed stuff from Target.

12:56.908 --> 12:57.629
[SPEAKER_04]: I needed shampoo.

12:58.069 --> 12:59.910
[SPEAKER_04]: So we went to Target at 8 o'clock.

12:59.970 --> 13:00.350
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fine.

13:00.690 --> 13:04.351
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go out at night on Black Friday and after all the crazies have gone to bed, totally fine.

13:04.371 --> 13:05.091
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like any other day.

13:05.692 --> 13:09.373
[SPEAKER_04]: Even went to Fry's and got some upgrades for the studio I'll talk about in a minute.

13:10.733 --> 13:12.134
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, did you take advantage of any deals?

13:12.294 --> 13:16.334
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought nothing because I have no money to buy things with.

13:16.414 --> 13:17.815
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what happens when you're a parent.

13:17.875 --> 13:18.555
[SPEAKER_09]: You have no money.

13:18.615 --> 13:19.855
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's just being a parent.

13:20.295 --> 13:22.556
[SPEAKER_04]: You're also a homeowner and you just bought a new car.

13:22.856 --> 13:23.616
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a big one.

13:24.796 --> 13:25.176
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

13:25.196 --> 13:29.117
[SPEAKER_10]: I just feel like giving people crap for small reasons.

13:29.397 --> 13:31.618
[SPEAKER_04]: Congrats on the used car.

13:31.918 --> 13:32.658
[SPEAKER_03]: New to you car.

13:33.058 --> 14:00.605
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just um and also the other thing too is like the last steam sale i bought a bunch of games i still haven't played most of them and i haven't played most of the games that i got through my humble bundle so i'm just kind of like you know hey that's cool borderlands 2 is down to like 30 bucks whatever am i really gonna play it probably not so it's just you know kind of answering the question is this really something i'm going to play and a lot of times it's no i'm probably not going to play that so that's why i haven't really been buying anything

14:01.889 --> 14:03.809
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't really buy anything either.

14:04.310 --> 14:07.710
[SPEAKER_04]: I did buy another Wii U game when I was at Fry's picking up the new router.

14:07.850 --> 14:15.292
[SPEAKER_04]: I got Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed for the Wii U just because some of my other friends had it and was giving it positive reviews.

14:16.012 --> 14:20.173
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only a deal because it's one of the two non-$60 games, I think.

14:20.733 --> 14:20.973
[SPEAKER_04]: I think 50.

14:21.634 --> 14:22.814
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 40, actually.

14:23.434 --> 14:25.274
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think I paid 40 for it.

14:25.314 --> 14:26.635
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe I did get a deal and didn't realize it.

14:26.655 --> 14:27.495
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think I only paid 40 for it.

14:27.955 --> 14:31.856
[SPEAKER_03]: And I might have been a deal then because I think that was supposed to be like a $50 game.

14:31.876 --> 14:32.717
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I did get a deal!

14:34.197 --> 14:35.698
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I only paid $44 and I'm pretty sure.

14:35.758 --> 14:36.898
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty cool.

14:37.898 --> 14:40.939
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was one other game that was cheaper than the others.

14:40.999 --> 14:41.760
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember what it was.

14:43.240 --> 14:45.961
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

15:06.270 --> 15:10.734
[SPEAKER_10]: and I actually touched some WoW so you guys wouldn't kick me out of the guild.

15:12.015 --> 15:28.387
[SPEAKER_04]: Going back to Mass Effect in a minute I mean obviously you've talked tons about it on the show but I found the modding you were doing this week interesting because you were posting to our little rabid fan community we have on Facebook and you had like these different colored skinned shepherds like you went in and had like a green skinned shepherd and this weird stuff.

15:28.407 --> 15:33.211
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay I'll tell you where this came about is because and this is actually me using a little bit

15:33.271 --> 15:35.933
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm working on making a somewhat Middle Eastern looking shepherd.

15:52.723 --> 16:06.695
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've tweaked the eyes, I've tweaked the nose, and now I'm tweaking the skin tone, but it's either coming out like too much of a muted chocolate, you know, like the plain milk chocolate with no extra skin tone to it, nothing blushing, nothing under that.

16:07.396 --> 16:11.059
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I'm playing with blushes, I'm playing with all this, and then I had an idea.

16:11.079 --> 16:17.705
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, well, if all of this is showing through whatever the skin is, can I make a Blue Shepard?

16:18.385 --> 16:19.027
[SPEAKER_10]: Blue Shepard

16:27.054 --> 16:27.474
[SPEAKER_10]: It worked.

16:27.514 --> 16:28.735
[SPEAKER_10]: So then I did Red Shepard.

16:29.135 --> 16:30.315
[SPEAKER_10]: Then I did Green Shepard.

16:30.435 --> 16:33.316
[SPEAKER_10]: Then I did Yellow Shepard, which looks more like Puke Green Shepard.

16:33.516 --> 16:36.878
[SPEAKER_10]: But I could get it to work because I've gotten purple hair.

16:37.858 --> 16:38.538
[SPEAKER_10]: The hair works.

16:38.658 --> 16:43.320
[SPEAKER_03]: Congratulations for now fusing the fan communities of Avatar and Mass Effect.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.781
[SPEAKER_03]: There already were blue people in Mass Effect, though.

16:46.861 --> 16:47.701
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't matter.

16:47.741 --> 16:48.982
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need more blue people.

16:50.757 --> 16:51.778
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

17:15.301 --> 17:19.303
[SPEAKER_10]: and I've modified my coalesced INI to add extra outfits.

17:19.343 --> 17:21.004
[SPEAKER_10]: There is a naked skin for female Shepard.

17:23.105 --> 17:24.565
[SPEAKER_10]: However, she has no real butt crack.

17:26.046 --> 17:27.947
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a naked one for the guys but I can't find it.

17:27.967 --> 17:30.108
[SPEAKER_10]: What is it with the girls and the nudity tonight?

17:31.068 --> 17:31.649
[SPEAKER_03]: It's no problem.

17:31.669 --> 17:34.853
[SPEAKER_03]: You can fix that butt crack problem by just editing the texture.

17:34.893 --> 17:36.615
[SPEAKER_10]: There actually is an edited texture.

17:36.635 --> 17:37.556
[SPEAKER_03]: Buy her bigger panties.

17:37.576 --> 17:39.599
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how you fix the butt crack problem.

17:39.879 --> 17:44.504
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like there's no bits to show and no coloration in certain places.

17:44.985 --> 17:49.631
[SPEAKER_10]: And someone has made, by the way, I found that ages ago, but I didn't know that it actually was based off of real texture.

17:50.271 --> 17:52.171
[SPEAKER_10]: and you can unlock the texture and it's like, okay, whatever.

17:52.191 --> 17:52.912
[SPEAKER_03]: And who'd have thunk it?

17:52.972 --> 17:54.872
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the person that draws the vaginas for you.

17:54.892 --> 17:56.532
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's not the same person.

17:57.433 --> 17:58.593
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not the same person.

17:59.793 --> 18:05.914
[SPEAKER_10]: But there's actually, did you know that there are two different fabric textures for the underwear?

18:06.875 --> 18:07.835
[SPEAKER_10]: There's shiny and matte.

18:08.155 --> 18:11.536
[SPEAKER_04]: I just learned something that I never thought I'd ever know in my life.

18:11.796 --> 18:14.936
[SPEAKER_10]: But I've had my shepherd running around in an all black uniform.

18:15.356 --> 18:18.497
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's actually black and a lighter black for the camo.

18:19.484 --> 18:35.019
[SPEAKER_04]: I have seen some hilarious gifs on Tumblr of I guess there's a way to hack it so that you can play male Shepard in his underwear through the whole game and there's some hilarious gifs of male Shepard jumping out of a starship and he's in his underwear.

18:35.039 --> 18:36.240
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks really funny.

18:36.500 --> 18:46.169
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you can actually, in the Coalesce Dye and Eye, because basically all you do, you can add lines to have it pull different textures for different outfits.

18:46.429 --> 18:50.353
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can actually wear armor in casual look and wear casual clothes into armor.

18:50.653 --> 18:54.917
[SPEAKER_10]: There's also a way to use Ashley's clothes, but I went and looked through the actual meshes.

18:55.878 --> 19:10.963
[SPEAKER_10]: The reason why there's a big problem with people using Ashley's face is first of all it's fully colored so if you have it over a colored face already it's going to show up orange and part of her chest is rendered so you'd actually get Shepard with a hole in her chest if you try to use Ashley's clothes with no boobs pretty much.

19:11.423 --> 19:12.424
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh boy, alright.

19:12.504 --> 19:14.346
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, this is what I spent all week doing.

19:14.486 --> 19:17.029
[SPEAKER_04]: You're gonna need your own podcast about Mass Effect at some point.

19:17.129 --> 19:17.509
[SPEAKER_10]: Just wait.

19:17.749 --> 19:18.790
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, moving on.

19:19.011 --> 19:19.731
[SPEAKER_10]: But I did play another game.

19:19.911 --> 19:20.272
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, what else?

19:20.712 --> 19:26.238
[SPEAKER_10]: Dragon Age Origins, and I made a Dalish, which I sometimes want to call a Danish.

19:26.698 --> 19:31.503
[SPEAKER_10]: She's a redhead, kind of cool, and I don't know that I like the game so much yet, but I'm gonna give it a try.

19:31.863 --> 19:37.993
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it might be one of those games that, you know, I didn't really love it the first time I played it, but I went back later and I liked it a little more.

19:38.193 --> 19:40.677
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's just kind of, sometimes games don't really hit you the first time.

19:41.217 --> 19:42.880
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just really not a big fan of the combat in it.

19:43.381 --> 19:46.425
[SPEAKER_10]: But I might go back and see about getting Dragon Age 2.

19:48.445 --> 20:15.781
[SPEAKER_10]: which I started playing on Xbox 360 and got pretty far in until that stupid battle where Fenris is like I'm gonna be emo and kill you now see that's really weird because most of the fandom really doesn't like Dragon Age 2 but it plays like Mass Effect I mean really I like the way it plays that's why I could get into Mass Effect so easily because it handled the same way well you know there's a third one coming out maybe it'll be somewhere in the middle and I played very solitaire

20:16.201 --> 20:16.501
[SPEAKER_04]: Game Sucks

20:37.930 --> 20:40.131
[SPEAKER_12]: I just learned something there you go the more you know

20:56.177 --> 21:00.780
[SPEAKER_12]: I find something new in every single replay.

21:00.800 --> 21:03.001
[SPEAKER_12]: There's always one more secret door I haven't gone through.

21:03.121 --> 21:04.842
[SPEAKER_12]: There's one more connection to Half-Life.

21:06.143 --> 21:11.687
[SPEAKER_12]: The way they paint their characters, everything's pretty three-dimensional, so I appreciate it on a couple different levels.

21:11.707 --> 21:13.268
[SPEAKER_12]: You should talk to Alan about Half-Life at some point.

21:13.288 --> 21:14.649
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you a big Half-Life fan as well?

21:15.029 --> 21:15.869
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

21:41.122 --> 21:42.443
[SPEAKER_03]: Modern Warfare 3 Modern Warfare 3

21:57.692 --> 22:12.820
[SPEAKER_03]: and also some other stuff because the website I had set up had went down because the free URL forwarding company, co.cc, went under and all the like 5 million domains that they had are poof, gone.

22:13.220 --> 22:14.941
[SPEAKER_03]: So I actually got a legit domain now.

22:15.021 --> 22:21.004
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's now at vog-minecraft.com and there's not really anything there other than the map right now.

22:21.204 --> 22:23.325
[SPEAKER_03]: But eventually there'll be something there.

22:23.965 --> 22:27.127
[SPEAKER_03]: So I put that in our chat room, vog-minecraft.com

22:27.683 --> 22:30.684
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's also a Twitter account to go along with that.

22:31.485 --> 22:33.705
[SPEAKER_03]: VOG Minecraft at Twitter.

22:33.866 --> 22:34.406
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at you.

22:35.366 --> 22:38.367
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

22:38.387 --> 22:44.690
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been kind of busy with stuff this week and then hopefully I'll get working on the website soon.

22:44.930 --> 22:50.032
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know what I want to do with it but I've got it for a while so we'll play around with that.

22:50.472 --> 22:51.533
[SPEAKER_03]: What else did I do this week?

22:52.473 --> 22:53.493
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I played anything else.

22:53.753 --> 22:54.314
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that was it.

22:54.394 --> 22:55.034
[SPEAKER_03]: That was all I played.

22:56.899 --> 23:03.783
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually had a lot of time to play some games thanks to the holiday break and I didn't have too much going on outside of Thanksgiving Day itself.

23:05.204 --> 23:09.867
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously I've been able to spend more time with the Wii U because on the last show it was launch day.

23:10.267 --> 23:12.028
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd only really spent like an hour with it.

23:12.108 --> 23:19.433
[SPEAKER_04]: So now I've been able to spend some quality time with the Wii U and I've played three different games on the Wii U and two of them are the ones that everybody's been playing.

23:19.453 --> 23:21.014
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll talk first about Nintendo Land.

23:21.814 --> 23:49.220
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo Land is a collection of minigames basically I think it's framed a lot better than Wii Sports was I think Monita though as a character will get a little bit irritating to some people but she serves her purpose especially for trying to get those that are not as familiar with how to play a video game acquainted with the games there are some pretty neat games in there I think I like the minigames in it more than I like Wii Sports because let's be real at the end of the day

23:50.100 --> 23:51.841
[SPEAKER_04]: WeTennis was about flailing.

23:51.961 --> 23:53.282
[SPEAKER_04]: There wasn't a lot of skill to it.

23:53.542 --> 23:54.783
[SPEAKER_04]: There wasn't a lot that went into it.

23:54.863 --> 23:57.864
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like imagination with the help of this controller.

23:58.304 --> 24:00.586
[SPEAKER_04]: WeBowling was slightly a little better.

24:00.646 --> 24:05.188
[SPEAKER_04]: You felt like you were a little more in control of your actions, but it was kind of eh at the end of the day as well.

24:05.228 --> 24:09.610
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Wii Sports, when all is said and done, I know not everybody's going to agree with this comment.

24:09.710 --> 24:12.692
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand why it ends up on the top 100 gaming list and all that.

24:12.732 --> 24:14.133
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a very influential game.

24:14.473 --> 24:16.334
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think Wii Sports is actually a really good game.

24:17.054 --> 24:19.658
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Nintendo Land because as a gamer, I feel like there's more game in it.

24:32.496 --> 24:34.537
[SPEAKER_04]: There's more to actually achieve.

24:35.898 --> 24:38.019
[SPEAKER_04]: The Metroid Blast was fun.

24:38.099 --> 24:43.542
[SPEAKER_04]: The F-Zero race, it's certainly not F-Zero, but it's simple enough.

24:43.702 --> 24:47.204
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of like Atari 2600 basic, but all of these modern graphics.

24:47.284 --> 24:48.125
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun.

24:49.425 --> 24:58.230
[SPEAKER_04]: The Donkey Kong course is surprisingly like... It's like one of those Mega Man hard games, and all it is is tilting.

24:58.570 --> 25:00.291
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's surprisingly quite a bit of fun.

25:00.972 --> 25:01.032
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

25:02.092 --> 25:20.929
[SPEAKER_04]: and you know some of the some of the different minigames especially in a party environment the party games the Mario Chase, Animal Crossing, Luigi's Mansion all hilarious we played those on Thanksgiving Day and they were all just a ton of fun especially I think Mario Chase was my personal favorite out of the bunch though Luigi's Mansion is really good as well and Animal Crossing is its own thing

25:21.529 --> 25:28.191
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but I mean, at its core, those three games are all kind of chase games.

25:28.331 --> 25:31.012
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just like a different twist on the chase element.

25:31.572 --> 25:37.493
[SPEAKER_04]: Like in Luigi's Mansion, you're hidden and you're trying to grab the others before they grab you.

25:37.914 --> 25:40.094
[SPEAKER_04]: In Mario Chase, they're just trying to grab you.

25:40.534 --> 25:44.455
[SPEAKER_04]: In Animal Crossing, you control two people and there's the whole eating the pellets.

25:44.495 --> 25:46.736
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I guess it's a little more, uh, different.

25:47.696 --> 25:52.520
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw brings up in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com What about that Pachinko in Nintendo Land?

25:52.540 --> 25:53.321
[SPEAKER_04]: The Pachinko game.

25:53.401 --> 25:55.642
[SPEAKER_04]: I call it Plinko, but yeah, it's pretty much the same thing.

25:56.163 --> 25:57.724
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, they're pretty much the same thing.

25:57.824 --> 25:58.304
[SPEAKER_04]: Paplinko?

25:58.945 --> 25:59.465
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Plinko.

25:59.866 --> 26:01.026
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, but I was saying Paplinko.

26:01.447 --> 26:01.907
[SPEAKER_04]: Paplinko?

26:02.007 --> 26:03.168
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead of Pachinko, Paplinko.

26:03.328 --> 26:03.768
[SPEAKER_04]: Paplinko?

26:03.969 --> 26:04.769
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, okay, that works.

26:05.110 --> 26:09.453
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a Paplinko game you play to get the unlocks, but eh, I could give or take it.

26:09.493 --> 26:10.794
[SPEAKER_04]: The unlock is a little bit silly.

26:11.474 --> 26:11.554
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

26:12.575 --> 26:15.536
[SPEAKER_04]: But as a pack-in game overall, it's fine.

26:16.196 --> 26:21.838
[SPEAKER_04]: I would see myself revisiting this game far more than I would revisit Wii Sports.

26:23.679 --> 26:27.000
[SPEAKER_04]: Mario U, Super Mario Wii U, is great.

26:27.500 --> 26:28.561
[SPEAKER_04]: It's HD Mario.

26:29.041 --> 26:30.041
[SPEAKER_04]: It's what you'd expect.

26:30.361 --> 26:39.565
[SPEAKER_04]: What I love about it is that it's not just a game with the depth of Super Mario World, but it has all these little extra modes as well to kind of enhance it, like the...

26:40.445 --> 26:42.026
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

26:58.897 --> 27:03.120
[SPEAKER_04]: The difficulty level of the game ramps up surprisingly quick, and there's some really hard stuff.

27:03.380 --> 27:05.361
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to use an FAQ to get past one of the levels.

27:05.701 --> 27:07.683
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't find the stinking door out of the ghost house.

27:08.003 --> 27:11.005
[SPEAKER_04]: And then come to find out, there's like a second one I probably would have never have found.

27:11.405 --> 27:22.432
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm liking Mario Wii U as a really solid Mario game, even more than I think the one that was previously out on Wii, Wii Regular.

27:22.712 --> 27:25.634
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if that's just because the huge step up in the graphics or what.

27:26.354 --> 27:27.194
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

27:46.602 --> 27:49.244
[SPEAKER_04]: All the screen does is mirror what's on your TV.

27:50.064 --> 27:55.868
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to do the whole, I play something on my Wii U while you watch something on TV, that's great.

27:56.328 --> 27:59.650
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have control of your TV, it doesn't really add a lot to the experience.

27:59.790 --> 28:04.213
[SPEAKER_04]: Luckily, it's a gorgeous game to look at, even with all the little touches in the background.

28:04.233 --> 28:06.595
[SPEAKER_04]: They have little dancing Miis that show up in the background and stuff.

28:06.615 --> 28:08.196
[SPEAKER_04]: Just all these little touches that are really cool.

28:08.796 --> 28:12.601
[SPEAKER_04]: and the sound thing that I really hyped up last week is great.

28:14.022 --> 28:19.108
[SPEAKER_04]: The surround sound it kind of creates between the pad and the regular stereo is pretty cool.

28:19.729 --> 28:26.076
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, Mario's solid and I'm sure most people that will get a Wii U will pick this game up and it makes sense.

28:26.317 --> 28:26.757
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

28:27.678 --> 28:51.541
[SPEAKER_04]: um one other game I've been playing on the Wii U that was one of the launch titles uh Sonic Racing no Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed which is a game that's actually on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 as well it's just you know they also have the Wii U version this is the game we've been talking about on the show we kind of been joking about it and having fun with it because it has Danica Patrick very randomly as a character and it's amazing eyeliner

28:52.141 --> 29:03.684
[SPEAKER_04]: and Wreck-It Ralph and all these other Sega characters like Metal Sonic, Beat, one of the taxi cab drivers from Crazy Taxi, supposedly Alex Kidd gets unlocked at some point.

29:06.445 --> 29:09.826
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really surprised at how much I'm enjoying this game.

29:10.886 --> 29:37.390
[SPEAKER_04]: and I took a look at some of the reviews online and some of the talk in Miiverse and so forth and a lot of people razzing it for being buggy and I will admit there's been some odd collision detection things but nothing that detracted from the experience so much I was like hating the game in fact I found myself most of the time actually really impressed with some of the level design the stages are all huge stages and they will seamlessly go from

29:37.910 --> 29:44.153
[SPEAKER_04]: Go-karting to flying a plane and Danica Patrick's car turns into like an afterburner jet, which is kind of funny.

29:44.653 --> 29:45.853
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the water.

29:45.893 --> 29:48.895
[SPEAKER_04]: And it kind of just seamlessly transitions between all these different phases.

29:49.475 --> 29:50.575
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was liking it.

29:51.476 --> 29:56.158
[SPEAKER_04]: I was showing you girls before the show tonight, I showed you the Skies of Arcadia level.

29:56.498 --> 30:03.921
[SPEAKER_04]: And you saw how you'll do the first lap and then in the second lap, the pirate ships start attacking the town and are blowing up the road and all this stuff.

30:03.941 --> 30:04.921
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot going on.

30:04.941 --> 30:04.961
[SPEAKER_04]: I

30:07.282 --> 30:24.091
[SPEAKER_04]: I was really into it I gotta admit I'm kind of liking this game I think a little more than the online impressions I mean it's it's got not just a regular mode but all these like special little games in it like boost mode and kill the other people first and there's a battle mode you can play it online on the Wii U

30:25.171 --> 30:30.616
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently the advantage that the Wii U has over the other versions is that the Wii U is up to five players thanks to the second screen.

30:31.997 --> 30:36.261
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just a copy of the first screen in single player mode unless you want it to be.

30:36.602 --> 30:39.104
[SPEAKER_04]: If you swipe the screen, you get a copy of the TV.

30:39.464 --> 30:41.726
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you don't, you get a rear view mirror and a map.

30:42.147 --> 30:44.529
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, kind of what you'd expect in your racing game on the second screen.

30:44.969 --> 30:48.012
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I was really surprised.

30:48.252 --> 30:49.393
[SPEAKER_04]: I was kind of like playing it going...

30:50.174 --> 31:00.048
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Sega did help with that F-Zero game that was on the GameCube and I gotta say, this feels like kind of the closest thing I'm gonna get to an F-Zero game for a little while.

31:00.669 --> 31:03.112
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless maybe they're gonna work on it, which I really hope they do.

31:03.513 --> 31:03.973
[SPEAKER_11]: Sugar Rush.

31:04.033 --> 31:05.936
[SPEAKER_04]: Or yeah, or just flat out do a Sugar Rush game.

31:05.956 --> 31:06.297
[SPEAKER_04]: Sugar Rush!

31:07.805 --> 31:16.574
[SPEAKER_04]: It's weird because the Wreck-It Ralph thing, like, I don't... I mean, it's cool that Wreck-It Ralph and Danica Patrick are in there, I guess, but there's not really a lot else.

31:16.674 --> 31:20.659
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, you don't have the sugar rest stage, or at least I haven't got it yet, or any of that.

31:20.739 --> 31:22.480
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's interesting.

31:23.361 --> 31:33.244
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to some of the comments from our chatters at live.vognetwork.com, Tigerclaw says, the new Sonic racing game is a lot of fun, but boy, it gets pretty hard when doing the medium difficulty on many of the races in difficulty.

31:33.644 --> 31:35.864
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't get past the drift challenges on medium.

31:36.245 --> 31:41.226
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can do some of it on medium, but like the boost challenge, I couldn't even do that on...

31:41.946 --> 31:56.869
[SPEAKER_04]: regular and here's a little tip for anybody struggling with the game if you flop on a stage four times it'll let you just skip it on the map so you know but you'll still need stars you'll have to compensate the stars from somewhere else in order to be able to get the unlock so I don't know

31:57.890 --> 32:01.111
[SPEAKER_04]: Tiger Claw suggests that maybe some of the Wreck-It-Ralph stuff will be DLC.

32:01.591 --> 32:03.572
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know how the Wii U is going to handle that.

32:04.052 --> 32:09.313
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will say that part of it kind of concerns me that the Wii U doesn't seem to have a DLC system in place.

32:09.814 --> 32:17.216
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the reason I haven't picked up Mass Effect 3 is I hear that none of the multiplayer enhancements they've done since launch are available.

32:17.616 --> 32:19.336
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, well, then what's the frigging point?

32:19.696 --> 32:25.798
[SPEAKER_04]: Like part of the reason the Mass Effect 3 multiplayer is so amazing is because of all the constant DLC they've been putting out.

32:26.158 --> 32:30.100
[SPEAKER_04]: and I understand that some of the single player DLC is included but they're not going to get Omega.

32:30.300 --> 32:30.560
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

32:30.580 --> 32:32.241
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Nintendo can't do DLC yet.

32:33.502 --> 32:36.683
[SPEAKER_04]: Or if they can, they're not doing it a lot or something.

32:36.723 --> 32:37.063
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

32:37.103 --> 32:37.964
[SPEAKER_04]: So that part of it...

32:39.048 --> 33:05.689
[SPEAKER_04]: with all the positive I'm saying about the Wii U and overall I am satisfied with my purchase I would be in love with my purchase if some of these other things were corrected but I don't know Nintendo has over the past week been building a lot into the system we got over the past week we got the Netflix the Amazon the YouTube the Hulu and all that showed up like you know just day after day after day and I gotta say the YouTube app in particular

33:06.329 --> 33:10.350
[SPEAKER_04]: Very different look from the other, the PS3 and the Xbox Ones.

33:10.390 --> 33:10.710
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not bad.

33:10.730 --> 33:12.110
[SPEAKER_09]: Bobby said he didn't care for it, right?

33:12.290 --> 33:12.470
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

33:12.610 --> 33:13.811
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby said he didn't care for it, right?

33:14.231 --> 33:22.652
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember what he said about YouTube, but the look of it is weird because it doesn't really have any Nintendo branding and it doesn't really have Microsoft.

33:23.212 --> 33:27.553
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of different and it works pretty well, especially if you're logged in.

33:28.674 --> 33:34.935
[SPEAKER_04]: I enjoyed it more than the Xbox version of it, even though it functions similarly to

33:35.575 --> 33:37.197
[SPEAKER_04]: But it still felt easier to use.

33:37.257 --> 33:38.898
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe part of that is having the touchpad.

33:38.938 --> 33:39.339
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

33:39.899 --> 33:40.280
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah.

33:41.414 --> 33:42.514
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

33:42.855 --> 33:45.476
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw on chat says, Nintendo is just taking baby steps.

33:45.516 --> 33:47.676
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a whole new thing for them, the online community.

33:48.136 --> 33:51.718
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yes, but at some point you have to stop letting that be an excuse.

33:52.298 --> 33:58.360
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think a lot of us have said, oh, Nintendo, you're just new to the party and so we forgive you.

33:58.400 --> 34:01.561
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's kind of like, okay, that's true, but it's not an excuse.

34:02.162 --> 34:05.923
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, playing catch-up, you know, you've had a lot of time to play catch-up.

34:06.403 --> 34:09.624
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you should have thought about some of this during the Wii being out there.

34:10.165 --> 34:10.445
[SPEAKER_04]: But,

34:11.445 --> 34:17.087
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some parts about the Wii U like Miiverse is surprisingly interesting.

34:17.347 --> 34:20.168
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's actually something I keep going back to and looking at.

34:20.788 --> 34:24.810
[SPEAKER_04]: I like looking at the activity feed of my friends and what they've been posting in the games.

34:25.210 --> 34:29.892
[SPEAKER_04]: The first party games really urge you to make public posts in Miiverse to interact with.

34:30.472 --> 34:32.953
[SPEAKER_04]: And I find like I want to see what my friends are posting.

34:33.293 --> 34:35.714
[SPEAKER_04]: And the artwork people are doing is amazing.

34:36.474 --> 34:49.599
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know if you guys know this, but in the Wii U, when you turn it on, if you have your Wii U always connected to the internet, it downloads artwork from around the community, like things that have been popular or voted.

34:49.919 --> 34:55.821
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you turn on your Wii, you'll see a helping of random games, and then you'll see some of the popular comments.

34:55.921 --> 35:00.022
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're all these artwork that is really well done and funny.

35:00.543 --> 35:00.883
[SPEAKER_04]: And so...

35:02.003 --> 35:29.501
[SPEAKER_04]: I find it really neat and I don't know if this is what Nintendo intended but you gotta hand it to them this is something Microsoft and Sony aren't doing with their online so let's give Nintendo some credit here the first thing you get when you turn on your system is community you don't even get that with Xbox and Sony that's surprising so if there's one thing Nintendo is doing right when it comes to online community is the first thing you see

35:31.744 --> 35:32.205
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

35:33.727 --> 35:33.988
[SPEAKER_10]: Agreed.

35:34.569 --> 35:38.815
[SPEAKER_04]: Now obviously they have some slow steps in other places, but that's one step in the right direction.

35:41.715 --> 36:08.708
[SPEAKER_04]: going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com Ragenator in chat says interesting or just a novelty that you'll forget about in a month or two that's a very good question Ragenator and I think a lot of that depends on how well will the games in the future support it and what else will come what download content is going to come out what's going to keep the people talking what's going to keep the people providing those funny pictures and so forth and will they allow you to add cat pics later on

36:09.420 --> 36:13.161
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, apparently, like, people have been doing really random stuff.

36:13.241 --> 36:15.502
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I was reading something on my Facebook.

36:15.522 --> 36:22.084
[SPEAKER_04]: The Destructoid community took over one of the... I think it was the Rabbids game community with pictures of Willem Dafoe.

36:22.505 --> 36:30.287
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what the joke is there, but, like, they were drawing Willem Dafoe and writing... I mean, I don't... Sorry, I don't... I don't have time to read every single website on the internet.

36:30.587 --> 36:33.288
[SPEAKER_04]: But, like, I thought it was funny that they're kind of, like, trying to do that.

36:33.388 --> 36:35.229
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, so...

36:35.709 --> 36:37.970
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, people come up with their own ways to entertain themselves.

36:37.990 --> 36:43.152
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's turning into GameFAQs, basically, where they'll take over a message board.

36:44.293 --> 36:46.974
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how well they've succeeded, but yes, possibly.

36:47.634 --> 36:48.235
[SPEAKER_03]: Fantastic.

36:49.275 --> 36:51.496
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what Nintendo needs is more GameFAQs.

36:52.957 --> 36:55.359
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby in our chatroom wants to clarify some stuff.

36:55.459 --> 36:59.243
[SPEAKER_04]: BlackWolf says, Okay, A, Nintendo has a DLC system in place.

36:59.623 --> 37:00.664
[SPEAKER_04]: New Super Mario Bros.

37:00.824 --> 37:02.546
[SPEAKER_04]: U will have DLC, for instance.

37:03.066 --> 37:05.308
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that may be true, but where is it?

37:05.748 --> 37:06.769
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not here at launch.

37:07.110 --> 37:08.271
[SPEAKER_04]: That leads me to think...

37:08.971 --> 37:09.993
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still being built.

37:10.133 --> 37:12.756
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember my Winchester House comparison from last week?

37:12.997 --> 37:14.138
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's what's happening.

37:14.459 --> 37:18.625
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have any proof, but at the same time, where is the DLC?

37:18.645 --> 37:19.706
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gonna be there at launch.

37:20.147 --> 37:21.609
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, they've got six more years.

37:22.546 --> 37:24.187
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, let's see.

37:24.447 --> 37:28.988
[SPEAKER_04]: And Blackwolf said, B, I think YouTube videos look better in the internet browser than in the app.

37:29.909 --> 37:34.370
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can watch videos on the gamepad from the browser not available in the app.

37:34.430 --> 37:37.792
[SPEAKER_04]: Blackwolf also clarifying, I guess he reads more Destructoid than I do.

37:38.112 --> 37:46.275
[SPEAKER_04]: Blackwolf says, the initial joke was Jim Sterling said, I am remaking the community to be about Willem Dafoe because that's a better use of this community than the game.

37:46.655 --> 37:47.235
Okay.

37:47.915 --> 37:49.576
[SPEAKER_04]: The post got moderated away.

37:50.177 --> 37:53.358
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you not see how many people were pissed off at Day 1 DLC?

37:53.699 --> 37:57.001
[SPEAKER_04]: How pissed would you be if there was Day 1 DLC for New Super Mario Bros.

37:57.161 --> 37:57.261
[SPEAKER_04]: U?

37:58.321 --> 38:05.225
[SPEAKER_04]: But Bobby, I am pissed off that there isn't Day 1 DLC for the other games to play catch-up, especially when that DLC is free.

38:05.686 --> 38:13.310
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the case of Mass Effect 3, yes, I do feel like 100% of the game isn't there, especially when you're trying to be competitive with these other consoles.

38:13.670 --> 38:38.756
[SPEAKER_04]: I get that some of the single player DLC but when you're kind of trying to play catch up you know I think that part is missing I get what you're saying about the whole you don't want day one DLC for new Super Mario Brothers Wii U I get that but that's also first party versus third party and you know maybe Nintendo hasn't built it because they don't need it for themselves yet so screw everybody else I don't know anyway

38:40.219 --> 38:45.102
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, I've talked enough about the Wii U. Sorry, guys, but it's with the hot thing that's going on in gaming right now.

38:45.322 --> 38:47.944
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing I want to talk about in my gaming week, just real quick, I'll throw this out there.

38:48.624 --> 38:51.886
[SPEAKER_04]: Despite the fact that I have a shiny new console, it doesn't mean I'm not going to play other stuff.

38:52.306 --> 39:01.652
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been participating in the Mass Effect 3 weekend challenge like a good player, and I played an epic nine-hour match of Civilization V, start to finish.

39:01.972 --> 39:04.233
[SPEAKER_04]: and I know some people are going only nine hours.

39:04.593 --> 39:11.514
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we did kind of an easier skill level and we agreed the three of us that were playing would not military strike each other but it was a lot of fun.

39:11.654 --> 39:26.078
[SPEAKER_04]: It was my first Gods and Kings game start to finish so I was, you know, thankful I played it and I am still enjoying Civ V and it's on sale right now on Steam and I would support a purchase of that if you wanted to do that.

39:27.198 --> 39:27.298
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

39:27.978 --> 39:28.258
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

39:28.999 --> 39:31.880
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, that is all I want to say about my gaming week.

39:32.140 --> 39:33.041
[SPEAKER_04]: Housekeeping tonight.

39:34.381 --> 39:42.145
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, we always like to plug our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, and our Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, and our Google+, search for Orange Lounge Radio.

39:43.305 --> 39:46.427
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, this one's for the live listeners more so than the podcast listeners.

39:47.147 --> 39:50.909
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hoping so far tonight, live listeners, we haven't had any dropouts on the feed.

39:51.830 --> 39:56.632
[SPEAKER_04]: I know the fact that the stream has been dropping out lately has been very frustrating, but

39:57.592 --> 40:03.373
[SPEAKER_04]: and so we didn't really know if it was us or if it was the host but there's a good chance that it's us here in studio.

40:03.953 --> 40:09.694
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we did on Friday, Alan and I went out and we got a new router for the studio here.

40:09.774 --> 40:17.515
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have like a brand new, it's not like top of the line because I'm sorry, I didn't have 200 bucks to drop on a router but we did get one of those like, what is it, 600?

40:17.996 --> 40:18.976
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like 300 plus 300.

40:19.916 --> 40:21.976
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a huge step up from what we had.

40:22.236 --> 40:26.437
[SPEAKER_04]: Our last router couldn't even do wireless N so we did upgrade that

40:26.997 --> 40:32.180
[SPEAKER_04]: We had this whole thing going on where you actually had two networks in the house and one was daisy-chained to the other.

40:32.641 --> 40:35.943
[SPEAKER_04]: Now it's parent router and bridge.

40:36.463 --> 40:40.866
[SPEAKER_04]: I wrote a post in the VOG Network forums in more detail if you want to see all the parts there.

40:41.286 --> 40:41.907
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think...

40:42.387 --> 41:10.970
[SPEAKER_04]: so far the stream hasn't dropped and the evil protagonist in our chat says sounds great tonight so maybe it was us I didn't want to let that go forever without trying to fix it so fingers crossed now that I've talked about it it's going to drop in the next two minutes just watch but hey that's better than 20 times during the show like last week which was very very frustrating so thank you to our loyal live listeners who have stuck it out throughout all those drops we're trying to make the situation better for you guys I hope it works tonight

41:11.690 --> 41:11.950
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

41:13.811 --> 41:17.353
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Ragenator brings up, you know, by bringing up the stream dropping, you just jinxed yourself.

41:17.613 --> 41:18.393
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, hey, you know what?

41:18.413 --> 41:21.355
[SPEAKER_04]: We got through 48 minutes without one, which beats last week.

41:21.455 --> 41:24.757
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's just hope.

41:25.877 --> 41:26.297
[SPEAKER_04]: Also...

41:27.558 --> 41:32.381
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a slow news week tonight, you guys, with the holiday going on and everything here in the States.

41:32.801 --> 41:37.304
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will tease the coming up in Part B tonight, Match Game.

41:37.364 --> 41:40.686
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't done Match Game in at least a year, so we're going to do Match Game tonight.

41:40.766 --> 41:44.208
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will have contestants, one via Skype, one via the chat.

41:44.248 --> 41:50.252
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want to be potentially our Skype player, make sure you have Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, added on Skype.

41:50.532 --> 41:51.553
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, we're not doing that now.

41:51.773 --> 41:54.715
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll get into it in Part B. I'll let you know when to call.

41:55.683 --> 41:57.604
[SPEAKER_04]: All the symphony of the night you can stand.

42:25.256 --> 42:29.298
[SPEAKER_03]: True, or, you know, if this is going to be like... So much Yaris.

42:29.698 --> 42:31.079
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's going to be... I'm interested in this.

42:31.599 --> 42:38.902
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's going to be like a digital, like a digital Xbox where it's not going to have a disk drive or something like that, it's going to be built into a TV, like as an app.

42:39.803 --> 42:42.584
[SPEAKER_03]: I could see it maybe like, you know, with the games on demand stuff.

42:42.604 --> 42:45.005
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just about to say, couldn't they do games on demand still though?

42:45.325 --> 42:45.966
[SPEAKER_03]: That's possible.

42:46.226 --> 42:49.927
[SPEAKER_04]: All it needs is a USB port and you can suddenly, oh, magical 64 gigs.

42:51.088 --> 42:52.609
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're saying, of course...

42:53.789 --> 42:57.471
[SPEAKER_03]: Anonymous sources are telling them that it's going to be dubbed Xbox TV.

42:57.671 --> 43:01.093
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to support casual games and run on Windows 8.

43:01.373 --> 43:06.355
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's just going to be running on the dashboard that's out there that kind of looks like Windows 8.

43:07.456 --> 43:12.999
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess some sort of chipset is going to allow for quick bootups and that kind of stuff.

43:13.639 --> 43:24.712
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're saying that it's also going to be able to kind of like, I don't know, maybe kind of incorporate surface stuff or smart glass or anything like that.

43:27.482 --> 43:32.746
[SPEAKER_03]: and I guess, you know, Microsoft made a statement regarding the set-up box plans.

43:32.766 --> 43:44.233
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying Xbox 360 has found new ways to extend the console lifecycle by introducing controller-free experiences with Kinect and reinventing the console with a new dashboard and new entertainment content partnerships.

43:44.253 --> 43:49.717
[SPEAKER_04]: The typical bullshit line they're going to give when the Christmas season is going on and they don't want people to neglect what's happening now.

43:49.777 --> 43:51.818
[SPEAKER_03]: We are always thinking about what is next for our platform.

43:51.858 --> 43:53.679
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, yeah, that's probably going to be true.

43:54.620 --> 43:57.742
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, in other words, don't think about what's coming out next year.

43:57.882 --> 44:00.124
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about putting a Kinect under your Christmas tree this year.

44:00.644 --> 44:01.544
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly what it is.

44:01.645 --> 44:06.428
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't put a Kinect under your Christmas tree unless you're into dancing games because all the games that have come out have been kind of crap.

44:06.448 --> 44:07.448
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean.

44:07.768 --> 44:08.489
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying.

44:10.470 --> 44:15.391
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I know this is going to sound stupid and I'm going to sound like an idiot, but hear me out here.

44:15.492 --> 44:19.973
[SPEAKER_04]: Could this be a very corporate challenge to the Ouya?

44:20.693 --> 44:30.156
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that comparison is really weird because I know the Ouya's whole thing is open source and all this, but do you think still maybe Microsoft took a look at that whole thing and said...

44:30.956 --> 44:35.782
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe people want a $99 thing they just took up to their TV and play games with.

44:35.822 --> 44:39.587
[SPEAKER_04]: And although we sure as hell aren't going to make it open source, maybe we'll make it look like a PC.

44:39.727 --> 44:42.411
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, is this maybe a response to the Ouya, if true?

44:43.658 --> 44:44.158
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably not.

44:44.198 --> 44:48.341
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they feel any threat from the OUYA yet, because there's no real system there.

44:48.361 --> 44:50.722
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you can't feel a threat about something that's not out yet.

44:51.643 --> 44:56.986
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a threat, but it's doing what Microsoft does, taking an idea and trying to make it better, for better or for worse.

44:57.006 --> 44:57.326
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.

44:57.346 --> 45:00.688
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, if anything, they would be kind of going with the whole...

45:01.548 --> 45:08.792
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we've seen some of these integrated, maybe even looking at Apple TV or something like that.

45:08.912 --> 45:13.954
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, they're just a step away from actually having a system that runs apps and stuff.

45:15.075 --> 45:16.776
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's really going to...

45:18.340 --> 45:19.041
[SPEAKER_03]: Be anything.

45:19.081 --> 45:22.703
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because if you think about it, let's say this comes out a year from now.

45:22.923 --> 45:32.149
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would I want to buy a stripped down version of the Xbox 360 when the regular Xbox 360 is probably going to be under $100 or just about $100?

45:32.189 --> 45:38.953
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you think about it, yes, you may not be able to get the brand new system that's out right now, but those older systems, they're already at about $100 or just over $100.

45:39.013 --> 45:39.894
[SPEAKER_03]: So why would I want to...

45:42.435 --> 45:48.739
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, put out something that's gonna... Maybe if it's one of those funky partnerships where it's all built into the TV.

45:49.559 --> 45:53.582
[SPEAKER_04]: But, see, that's... Why would you buy something like that that's built into the TV?

45:53.622 --> 45:56.404
[SPEAKER_04]: Because... Why do people buy TVs with built-in Blu-ray players?

45:56.444 --> 45:59.105
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do people buy TVs with built-in Roku and so forth?

45:59.385 --> 46:02.387
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like those LaserDisc players that had the Sega CD built in it.

46:02.547 --> 46:02.927
[SPEAKER_03]: It's dumb.

46:02.947 --> 46:06.289
[SPEAKER_03]: You should never buy a TV with something built into it.

46:06.870 --> 46:07.970
[SPEAKER_04]: You know who buys that stuff?

46:08.031 --> 46:08.491
[SPEAKER_04]: My parents.

46:08.931 --> 46:09.691
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

46:33.821 --> 46:51.286
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though the thing might be capable of doing all this other stuff you're talking about with the more geometry wars and so forth, maybe the push is to grandma who enjoys Farmville now maybe wants apples to apples on her TV or whatever else Microsoft might reveal in the next year game-wise.

46:51.326 --> 46:52.587
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to be honest, though.

46:52.667 --> 46:57.208
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're saying that that's the reason that people would buy these TVs, I don't think those type of people would buy...

46:57.888 --> 46:58.508
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

47:16.577 --> 47:24.265
[SPEAKER_04]: So, well, because it won't just be a gaming console, it'll play the casual games, but it's going to have all of Microsoft's other stuff too.

47:24.305 --> 47:31.872
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll have all those channels with the, you know, the built-in Hulu and the Netflix and all that same shit you see on every console.

47:31.892 --> 47:33.073
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't think that they're going to do that.

47:33.093 --> 47:36.136
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only reason I don't think they're going to do that is because other people have done it better already.

47:36.356 --> 47:38.939
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's no reason to... Why wouldn't they want a piece of it then?

47:39.179 --> 47:40.140
[SPEAKER_03]: Why wouldn't they want a piece of it?

47:40.180 --> 47:41.121
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I don't think that they...

47:41.901 --> 47:45.384
[SPEAKER_03]: Has that worked out well for them in the whole mobile phone department?

47:45.504 --> 47:50.628
[SPEAKER_03]: Have they really taken a large chunk of the business from Android and iOS?

47:51.729 --> 47:51.949
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

47:52.189 --> 47:54.491
[SPEAKER_03]: When does that ever stop Microsoft from trying?

47:55.852 --> 47:56.072
[SPEAKER_03]: Well...

47:57.433 --> 48:03.116
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that they're definitely not trying as hard with Windows Phone 8 and stuff.

48:03.636 --> 48:08.539
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably selling alright, but I don't hear people going, Oh, I need a Windows Phone 8.

48:08.999 --> 48:15.703
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more like, I need an iPhone 5, or I need the next spiffy Android phone that's going to come out.

48:15.763 --> 48:23.207
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a possibility that they'll come out with something like this to try to get people in, but I don't know why you would do it.

48:25.060 --> 48:33.442
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just say that there are people that will buy things that don't make sense.

48:34.022 --> 48:34.442
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

48:35.343 --> 48:37.603
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me move on with some more news.

48:37.743 --> 48:43.205
[SPEAKER_04]: This is about some things that have gone on in the Wii U front since the console launched.

48:44.705 --> 48:49.469
[SPEAKER_04]: Some folks talking about a Miiverse hack and that Miiverse was hacked and all this.

48:49.549 --> 48:51.111
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not really what happened.

48:51.691 --> 48:57.737
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody on NeoGAF said that they were screwing around with Miiverse and they were able to get into the debug and admin options of Miiverse.

49:00.739 --> 49:02.441
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like that wasn't really what it is.

49:03.242 --> 49:04.563
[SPEAKER_04]: At least that's what Nintendo's claiming.

49:04.923 --> 49:06.985
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo's saying it was a prototype.

49:07.705 --> 49:13.590
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo did send out a statement to GamesIndustry.biz saying that what the user found was a mock-up menu.

49:13.751 --> 49:14.832
[SPEAKER_04]: It's no longer there.

49:15.572 --> 49:16.433
[SPEAKER_04]: It's inaccessible.

49:17.033 --> 49:26.462
[SPEAKER_04]: And that could be believable enough, especially if Miu, at its core, is basically running off a web protocol, which is certainly possible.

49:27.142 --> 49:28.344
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's absolutely possible.

49:28.384 --> 49:32.211
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole damn thing is running off a web-type-based protocol and we just kind of don't see it.

49:32.732 --> 49:33.092
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

49:34.334 --> 49:35.236
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably very easy.

49:35.617 --> 49:36.157
[SPEAKER_04]: So whatever.

49:36.218 --> 49:38.782
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm spouting like I know what I'm talking about.

49:42.515 --> 49:48.159
[SPEAKER_04]: It probably wasn't hard to find something like this in there, and I don't think it's very serious, especially if it was a mock-up.

49:48.219 --> 49:52.782
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, even just kind of looking at all the information on the screen, I don't think it's a big deal.

49:54.343 --> 50:02.390
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, if you want to know the full statement, quote, It has come to our attention that some of the people were able to access a mock-up menu on Miiverse following the launch of Wii U in the U.S.

50:02.750 --> 50:06.793
[SPEAKER_04]: Please know that this is only a mock-up menu and has now been removed and is not accessible.

50:07.033 --> 50:10.796
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember how we were talking about those doors that you open up and just, wham, you run into a wall?

50:11.137 --> 50:13.729
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's another one of those trap doors right there.

50:13.749 --> 50:15.195
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

50:15.777 --> 50:16.558
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone stumbled.

50:17.878 --> 50:21.921
[SPEAKER_04]: One other bit on the Wii U. You've got to give Nintendo credit for this.

50:22.601 --> 50:42.353
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a comment from Frozenbyte who made Trine 2, which is one of the download titles available on Wii U. You may not know this because it hasn't been talked about as much as the launch game, but there are five download-only games available on the Wii U. I'm not talking about the retail end, but I'm talking about $15 download games available on Wii U right now.

50:42.753 --> 50:44.174
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally have not tried any yet.

50:45.034 --> 50:45.875
[SPEAKER_04]: but they're available.

50:45.915 --> 50:47.375
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had friends Do they have demos?

50:48.636 --> 50:49.477
[SPEAKER_04]: Not now, no.

50:49.817 --> 50:54.779
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, Nintendo way to be in the forefront of digital content.

50:54.839 --> 50:55.640
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck.

50:56.400 --> 50:57.901
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation 1 had demos.

50:58.161 --> 50:59.482
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, but the Wii has demos.

50:59.722 --> 51:02.963
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, I'm going to say, was it ready to go by November 18th?

51:03.243 --> 51:04.624
[SPEAKER_04]: Look for it in December and January.

51:04.704 --> 51:05.525
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way it's going to be.

51:06.926 --> 51:07.406
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll happen.

51:07.746 --> 51:09.248
[SPEAKER_04]: It just wasn't ready November 18th.

51:09.928 --> 51:12.210
[SPEAKER_04]: But, okay, so they may not have demos, whatever.

51:12.230 --> 51:14.372
[SPEAKER_04]: But let me get to this, because I do think this is worth mentioning.

51:14.753 --> 51:18.716
[SPEAKER_04]: So Frozen Byte, they made Trine 2, which is probably one of the more visible titles that's there.

51:19.417 --> 51:31.909
[SPEAKER_04]: A quote from Mikael Haveri, who's the marketing manager, quote, "...we have the power to price our products as we please, with just some basic guidelines from the big guys."

51:32.389 --> 51:38.792
[SPEAKER_04]: The step to this is purely from Nintendo's side and they can clearly see that their previous installments have not been up to par.

51:39.392 --> 51:44.654
[SPEAKER_04]: We can set our own pricing and actually continuing on that by setting our own sales whenever we want.

51:45.114 --> 51:50.597
[SPEAKER_04]: It is very close to what Apple and Steam are doing at the moment and very indie friendly.

51:51.777 --> 51:52.638
[SPEAKER_04]: So in other words...

51:53.778 --> 52:01.984
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo's tried to fix some of this and make the DLC part of the download distribution component of the Wii U a little bit lucrative.

52:02.524 --> 52:03.345
[SPEAKER_04]: Free patches!

52:04.065 --> 52:05.946
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do patching all you want for free.

52:06.987 --> 52:15.673
[SPEAKER_04]: Considering we've heard the bitches from folks who make the Xbox Live Arcade games complain about the pricing of the patching over there, that suddenly makes this very lucrative.

52:15.713 --> 52:20.936
[SPEAKER_04]: Being able to put your own game on sale when you want and all that, that's going to make this a lot more attractive.

52:21.377 --> 52:22.918
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be interesting to see if

52:24.059 --> 52:43.102
[SPEAKER_04]: you know if it actually leads to the games being made because that's what it's really about if that happens though if there'll be any response from Microsoft and Sony but you got to admit Nintendo's doing the right thing there yeah so very interesting it makes good sense

52:43.672 --> 52:50.355
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, they've told us there are no basic payments for each patch and we can update our game almost as much as we want.

52:50.715 --> 52:52.556
[SPEAKER_04]: For indie developers, this is huge.

52:52.576 --> 52:55.457
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if that might be a lure for Minecraft.

52:55.517 --> 52:55.877
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

52:57.218 --> 52:57.598
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

52:58.018 --> 53:00.379
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to just throw making up stuff out there.

53:01.360 --> 53:05.962
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Map in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com wanted to bring this up about the demos.

53:06.462 --> 53:08.423
[SPEAKER_04]: Wii U has kiosk demos.

53:08.883 --> 53:10.124
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure it will happen soon.

53:11.784 --> 53:15.567
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason wants to point out, Loki, iOS doesn't have demos.

53:17.668 --> 53:18.568
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not true.

53:18.748 --> 53:19.569
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not true either.

53:19.749 --> 53:20.910
[SPEAKER_04]: It's up to the developer.

53:20.930 --> 53:21.890
[SPEAKER_04]: There's light versions.

53:22.070 --> 53:26.233
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's that whole light thing that they do, and now the whole in-app purchases.

53:26.253 --> 53:33.297
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't think about it because it's different than how Xbox and PlayStation does demos, but developers found a way to do it.

53:35.259 --> 53:38.162
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be interesting to see how that plays out on Wii U if it does.

53:38.863 --> 53:39.844
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, moving on with more news.

53:39.884 --> 53:40.344
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

53:40.664 --> 53:41.025
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait.

53:41.065 --> 53:42.146
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to add one last thing.

53:42.186 --> 53:42.546
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, go ahead.

53:42.666 --> 53:44.929
[SPEAKER_03]: There is actually some Wii hacks that actually happen.

53:45.209 --> 53:45.750
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

53:45.990 --> 53:51.395
[SPEAKER_03]: Legit stuff that... It's not necessarily the Wii U, but it's in the Wii...

53:53.257 --> 53:54.358
[SPEAKER_03]: I fucking hate how they have this.

53:55.199 --> 54:00.686
[SPEAKER_03]: The Wii Channel on the Wii U because that makes all the sense in the world.

54:01.567 --> 54:05.331
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say, I might be the only person who didn't transfer their Wii stuff over.

54:05.571 --> 54:08.935
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't see the benefit of doing that right now.

54:09.776 --> 54:11.698
[SPEAKER_04]: Can a chatter sway me that I'm wrong on that?

54:11.878 --> 54:13.020
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would I want to do that?

54:13.928 --> 54:14.689
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

54:15.189 --> 54:21.014
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a loader that was available for the Wii using Super Smash Bros.

54:21.074 --> 54:23.696
[SPEAKER_03]: Brawl called Stack Smash.

54:23.796 --> 54:28.000
[SPEAKER_03]: And what it basically does is it uses a modified brawl stage.

54:30.441 --> 54:56.856
[SPEAKER_03]: save file to run unsigned code and that exploit still works on the Wii U and so you can actually run Wii Homebrew through the Wii channel on the Wii U and they've even gotten there was a game that was played in one of the videos I saw here also they're saying that basically not everything works like you can't use the hacks you know to create like the Homebrew channel and stuff like that

54:57.416 --> 55:08.860
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're saying right now, nothing that requires HackMe uses, I guess, the current kernel exploits or uses AHB prods will work.

55:09.200 --> 55:13.582
[SPEAKER_03]: It says that includes Devolution, USB Loader, CIOS installers, and WeLinux.

55:14.342 --> 55:18.707
[SPEAKER_03]: But it says Nintendo cannot patch StackSmash using their current architecture.

55:18.827 --> 55:25.255
[SPEAKER_03]: While it's technically possible, it would require a lot of work on their part, and it could result in Super Smash Bros.

55:25.335 --> 55:27.657
[SPEAKER_03]: Brawl being unstable for all users.

55:27.778 --> 55:33.244
[SPEAKER_03]: Plus, it's most likely they knew that that would work before the guy posted the video.

55:33.584 --> 55:45.315
[SPEAKER_04]: so in other words hackers gonna hack they're looking frantically for a way in that device the clock is running how fast can they find the way into the Wii U and they already have found kind of a way in

55:45.683 --> 55:54.990
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they found a kind of way in and they've also, there was a video here that I guess they're dumping the console keys from the Wii mode stuff.

55:56.111 --> 55:59.773
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really know what exactly they would use with that, but still interesting, I guess.

56:01.074 --> 56:08.740
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting to note, though, Nintendo is kind of doing something where, you know, well, I guess Microsoft kind of does this, too, whenever you connect to live games.

56:08.960 --> 56:10.882
[SPEAKER_04]: is that it's going to automatically download firmware.

56:10.962 --> 56:13.364
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it'll download it overnight when it's not on and all that.

56:13.464 --> 56:16.586
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of like more how PlayStation Plus kind of does it.

56:18.087 --> 56:24.112
[SPEAKER_04]: In theory, I mean, we haven't seen it happen firsthand yet because there's only been the one patch, which most people do when you first turn on the system.

56:24.352 --> 56:24.993
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

56:39.628 --> 56:42.231
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I really wish they had the ring light stuff on there.

56:42.331 --> 56:43.673
[SPEAKER_04]: There were the messages.

56:44.534 --> 56:48.218
[SPEAKER_04]: You have the blue, it's now the home button on the pad is a blue light.

56:48.518 --> 56:51.121
[SPEAKER_04]: And whenever friends sign on and off, that little light lights up.

56:51.221 --> 56:53.263
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's just not as sexy as it was on the Wii.

56:53.404 --> 56:57.048
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not, but I just want to point out it's sort of there.

56:57.889 --> 56:58.329
[SPEAKER_04]: Sort of there.

57:00.604 --> 57:01.806
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

57:16.187 --> 57:19.412
[SPEAKER_10]: The R4 is a flash cartridge that works on the DS.

57:19.532 --> 57:22.838
[SPEAKER_10]: You can use homebrew or pirated games on the system.

57:23.919 --> 57:30.330
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's also ones called, like, I had a Ninja Pass was one that I had that doesn't work anymore.

57:32.272 --> 57:57.607
[SPEAKER_10]: but now Nintendo has really got a push on and got it with the Japanese government that the R4 is now illegal to sell in Japan actually like it's completely banned by the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry it was illegal to sell since 2009 but importing it is completely illegal now as far as

57:59.168 --> 58:00.489
[SPEAKER_10]: Other places that it's been banned.

58:00.529 --> 58:02.690
[SPEAKER_10]: It's now banned in France and the UK.

58:03.331 --> 58:08.354
[SPEAKER_10]: Amazon and eBay are no longer allowing this cartridge to be sold.

58:09.214 --> 58:16.279
[SPEAKER_10]: And different Australian distributors have been successfully sued by Nintendo.

58:17.119 --> 58:23.904
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm assuming it's still pretty available in the age-old venue of discreet brown paper bags in lavatories.

58:24.364 --> 58:24.824
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably.

58:24.984 --> 58:25.465
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, probably.

58:26.005 --> 58:28.146
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if I wanted one, I could go get one.

58:28.606 --> 58:29.346
[SPEAKER_10]: There's ways to get it.

58:29.386 --> 58:30.447
[SPEAKER_10]: You can order them online.

58:31.247 --> 58:36.589
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's now specifically illegal to import them in Japan.

58:37.029 --> 58:40.090
[SPEAKER_10]: Not just sell them like it was the rule.

58:40.290 --> 58:41.250
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't import it.

58:41.810 --> 58:43.631
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, you could, but you could go to jail.

58:44.918 --> 58:48.501
[SPEAKER_10]: or have them stare at you sternly and force you to kill yourself.

58:48.682 --> 59:00.052
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, probably a lot of it has to do with, you know, how out there you're being too because, like, in Australia, you weren't... I think it wasn't illegal to import the M-rated games because they had been banned in Australia.

59:00.072 --> 59:01.593
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I remember Mortal Kombat, the new one.

59:02.214 --> 59:09.281
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, isn't it, like, illegal to, like, send... I mean, now maybe it's not because of the whole new rating board but before it was, like, illegal to send a copy over there.

59:09.661 --> 59:10.001
[SPEAKER_04]: But, like...

59:11.062 --> 59:13.864
[SPEAKER_04]: How are they really going to find each and every person that does it?

59:13.964 --> 59:14.985
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that I'm encouraging it.

59:15.205 --> 59:17.487
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we all know why the R4 cart's being banned.

59:18.528 --> 59:20.909
[SPEAKER_03]: Although... You can still buy them, of course.

59:21.170 --> 59:21.790
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course you can.

59:22.030 --> 59:31.637
[SPEAKER_10]: We remember the beginning of 2010, there was that UK guy who went to jail for a year for importing 26,000 games to set up with an R4.

59:37.779 --> 59:41.802
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a difference between 26,000 games and me going on Craigslist.

59:42.302 --> 59:42.542
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

59:43.483 --> 59:47.626
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, regardless, if people want something badly enough, they're going to find a way to make it happen.

59:48.086 --> 59:51.529
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just that now it's officially a punishable crime.

59:52.409 --> 59:52.710
[SPEAKER_10]: The end.

59:54.291 --> 59:56.012
[SPEAKER_04]: And Nintendo just wants to put more hurdles up.

59:56.612 --> 59:57.393
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to make it harder.

59:57.413 --> 59:59.254
[SPEAKER_10]: They want to protect their product.

59:59.815 --> 01:00:01.476
[SPEAKER_10]: They're certainly well within their rights to do it.

01:00:02.805 --> 01:00:03.185
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.

01:00:03.646 --> 01:00:11.832
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, if you think about it, and I hate to say this, it was how easily replicated games were for Dreamcast that contributed to the Dreamcast failure.

01:00:12.272 --> 01:00:15.475
[SPEAKER_10]: Nintendo is already sitting kind of in a precarious position.

01:00:15.755 --> 01:00:15.955
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

01:00:16.255 --> 01:00:18.537
[SPEAKER_10]: So, of course they're going to want to protect their investment.

01:00:18.908 --> 01:00:27.599
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is a bummer because, you know, the homebrew element of it, you want to embrace, you want to be able to say like, yeah, people should be able to run homebrew on it.

01:00:27.659 --> 01:00:36.129
[SPEAKER_04]: But unfortunately, 95% of people, I pulled that number completely out of my ass, aren't really using it for, well, they're using it for homebrew and other things, you know.

01:00:36.670 --> 01:00:38.452
[SPEAKER_10]: See, I wanted to play fan translations.

01:00:40.237 --> 01:00:42.298
[SPEAKER_10]: But, you know, it's not in the cards.

01:00:42.318 --> 01:00:44.458
[SPEAKER_04]: Although technically that's illegal too, if you think about it.

01:00:44.798 --> 01:00:46.239
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well, they can bite my ass.

01:00:46.359 --> 01:00:46.999
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know.

01:00:47.079 --> 01:00:50.800
[SPEAKER_04]: That's always... I always feel like that too, and I've talked about this on the show.

01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:52.701
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when I feel justified in piracy.

01:00:53.501 --> 01:00:54.902
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that's a controversial opinion.

01:00:54.942 --> 01:00:57.402
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you may not agree with me there and what have you.

01:00:57.442 --> 01:01:01.964
[SPEAKER_04]: But if a company just isn't going to do it, then...

01:01:03.024 --> 01:01:08.347
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me just freaking get the translation version or, you know, let me get it from the other country.

01:01:08.407 --> 01:01:10.429
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I went off on this with Xenoblade.

01:01:11.709 --> 01:01:22.516
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's people who really like a series that's going to put that fun, you know, that effort into it, you know, and it really should actually more send a signal to the companies that fans want this.

01:01:22.576 --> 01:01:26.479
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, like what happened with, crap, what was that game that was on the Wii?

01:01:27.059 --> 01:01:27.479
[SPEAKER_04]: Xenoblade.

01:01:27.599 --> 01:01:28.300
[SPEAKER_10]: Xenoblade, yeah.

01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:29.881
[SPEAKER_10]: Of course people wanted Xenoblade.

01:01:30.761 --> 01:01:32.503
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was already, you know, in English.

01:01:33.544 --> 01:01:34.805
[SPEAKER_10]: But no one really knew it.

01:01:34.825 --> 01:01:37.628
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they did it because, you know, they realized, hey, it's stupid.

01:01:37.848 --> 01:01:38.649
[SPEAKER_10]: People do want it.

01:01:41.091 --> 01:01:42.273
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, last story.

01:01:43.359 --> 01:01:45.020
[SPEAKER_04]: Smart Strategy Smart Strategy

01:02:13.526 --> 01:02:16.687
[SPEAKER_04]: Frisbee seems to agree with us in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.

01:02:16.988 --> 01:02:21.349
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't sell a product to a country, they can't complain about lost sales due to downloading.

01:02:21.869 --> 01:02:23.210
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that's a controversial opinion.

01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:24.991
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it stinks, but I'm kind of like, you know what?

01:02:25.011 --> 01:02:25.851
[SPEAKER_10]: It's technically right.

01:02:26.051 --> 01:02:32.414
[SPEAKER_04]: The internet puts us in a more global community than companies want to sometimes acknowledge, and that's just the reality.

01:02:32.714 --> 01:02:35.615
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you feel so bad about it, why don't you freaking import it?

01:02:37.113 --> 01:02:40.975
[SPEAKER_04]: Import fees are so freaking expensive, though, and then region locking and all that crap.

01:02:40.995 --> 01:02:42.856
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's my Disaster, Dead, and Crisis?

01:02:43.537 --> 01:02:45.177
[SPEAKER_03]: There was another game that was in English.

01:02:45.458 --> 01:02:50.580
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's move on with more news.

01:02:51.481 --> 01:02:54.382
[SPEAKER_03]: So Sony's credit rating is kind of crap.

01:02:55.863 --> 01:02:57.504
[SPEAKER_03]: They're probably going to have to go to one of those...

01:02:58.084 --> 01:03:01.885
[SPEAKER_03]: Credit agencies that they advertise on TV, but not really.

01:03:02.766 --> 01:03:12.268
[SPEAKER_03]: So apparently one of the credit rating boards, I guess, out there, agencies, Fitch Ratings has rated them junk status.

01:03:12.729 --> 01:03:16.390
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, there was another company, I guess, Moody's, who I've never heard of.

01:03:17.110 --> 01:03:18.750
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually haven't heard either one of them.

01:03:19.231 --> 01:03:22.392
[SPEAKER_03]: They've dropped theirs to, I guess, one notch above junk.

01:03:22.492 --> 01:03:23.072
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess...

01:03:24.733 --> 01:03:27.575
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be some people.

01:03:28.235 --> 01:03:31.717
[SPEAKER_03]: Some may call this junk, but I call them treasures, I guess.

01:03:32.278 --> 01:03:37.001
[SPEAKER_03]: That level.

01:03:37.041 --> 01:03:44.946
[SPEAKER_03]: They said the downgrade reflects Fitch's belief that the meaningful recovery will be slow given the company's loss of technology, leadership, and key products.

01:03:45.346 --> 01:03:49.769
[SPEAKER_03]: High competition, weak economic conditions in developed markets, and the strong yen.

01:03:52.085 --> 01:03:53.246
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.

01:03:53.846 --> 01:03:59.949
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a company saying that they're going to fail, and I guess we just have to wait for them to either do so or not.

01:04:00.049 --> 01:04:00.410
[SPEAKER_03]: Amix?

01:04:01.850 --> 01:04:02.591
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I correct, though?

01:04:02.631 --> 01:04:07.674
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm not upping up on all my financial world stuff, but I believe this doesn't mean Sony...

01:04:08.454 --> 01:04:15.899
[SPEAKER_04]: is failing, it means that the analysts believe it's going to tank because they see the downward trend.

01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:24.805
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically saying, hey, banks that are lending Sony money, they're at more of a risk on not being able to pay those loans back.

01:04:26.226 --> 01:04:29.728
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though they're a big company, big companies file bankruptcy all the time.

01:04:30.689 --> 01:04:32.010
[SPEAKER_03]: Twinkies.

01:04:32.290 --> 01:04:37.974
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but also, how many of Sony's CEOs are giving themselves raises every four months?

01:04:39.639 --> 01:04:46.254
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, but also you're talking about more of a global company than Hostess was Sony's based in Japan, it's a very different culture there

01:04:46.624 --> 01:04:53.509
[SPEAKER_10]: True, but I mean, it's still, if they have sound business practices and deal ethically, then I think that they can turn around.

01:04:54.790 --> 01:04:58.973
[SPEAKER_10]: What happened with Hostess was a pure bout of greed and poor regulation.

01:04:59.193 --> 01:05:02.475
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, one thing with Sony is that they're more than games, too.

01:05:02.515 --> 01:05:03.316
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to remember.

01:05:03.356 --> 01:05:11.862
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a whole lot of other facets of Sony, and even though their games may be doing okay, although I think people wish the PlayStation 3 were doing better, especially the Vita.

01:05:12.182 --> 01:05:13.663
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like they're not doing well on the Vita.

01:05:13.863 --> 01:05:36.151
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that they weren't doing well in just like some of the other fields like for example Sony phones aren't you know Ericsson's not really a big thing anymore TVs they everybody goes off brand and gets the the Black Friday $200 TVs however Toshiba and Panasonic and Samsung have really pushed in LG especially those brands have really surpassed Sony in quality though

01:05:36.371 --> 01:05:41.933
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think people are buying cameras as much anymore because now the cameras and camera phones are alright.

01:05:42.093 --> 01:05:46.954
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're multi-megapixel cameras and for a lot of people that's just enough.

01:05:46.974 --> 01:05:50.976
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't need anything dedicated to just a camera unless you're actually really into photography.

01:05:51.236 --> 01:05:52.576
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I'll tell you this.

01:05:52.976 --> 01:05:58.358
[SPEAKER_10]: My iPhone camera is tons better than the Digital Rebel that my husband bought four years ago.

01:05:59.888 --> 01:06:04.472
[SPEAKER_04]: Dungeon Buster in our chat room, Sony has a lot of internal issues that contributed to their failure.

01:06:04.532 --> 01:06:06.594
[SPEAKER_04]: They have had a lot of shifting and things going on lately.

01:06:07.234 --> 01:06:12.319
[SPEAKER_04]: Bob Coffee says the strong yen is what's fucking Japanese companies bad, that exchange rate.

01:06:14.741 --> 01:06:20.926
[SPEAKER_04]: Dungeon Buster also clarifies his earlier comment saying all of their competitors hired who they tried to force into early retirement.

01:06:23.633 --> 01:06:30.358
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, we have to remember Sony is more than just games, but it's not like their games are performing, especially the Vita.

01:06:30.538 --> 01:06:34.260
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's not looking pretty for Sony right now.

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:41.085
[SPEAKER_10]: Another thing, too, is that companies in Japan don't have the rules regarding single types of products, too.

01:06:41.105 --> 01:06:45.989
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, for example, Toyota also makes housing siding.

01:06:46.469 --> 01:06:48.651
[SPEAKER_10]: Takara makes toys and wine.

01:06:49.291 --> 01:06:54.055
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the companies are allowed to branch out into other areas and expand.

01:06:54.095 --> 01:07:01.241
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, how else, I think, could Nintendo go from a card company to a computer entertainment company?

01:07:02.562 --> 01:07:16.453
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think the point is, though, is that first of all, I agree with the comment regarding the strength of the yen, but especially when you're dealing on an international market with other economies that you're relying on that don't have as strong fundage

01:07:17.233 --> 01:07:19.734
[SPEAKER_10]: Then, yeah, you're going to run into a lot of problems on the exchange as well.

01:07:21.275 --> 01:07:28.597
[SPEAKER_04]: Since I brought up the Vita, I do want to remind people, if you've been neglecting your Vita, PlayStation Plus just came out on the Vita, and there was a 2.0 patch for everybody.

01:07:29.298 --> 01:07:32.059
[SPEAKER_04]: So just, you know, go turn on your Vita if you haven't in a while.

01:07:32.439 --> 01:07:34.840
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't play enough of this game to really review it this week.

01:07:34.880 --> 01:07:35.840
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll talk about it next week.

01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:39.722
[SPEAKER_04]: But my early impressions of Gravity Rush, which is one of the free games on Plus right now...

01:07:41.622 --> 01:07:43.143
[SPEAKER_04]: Neat.

01:07:43.383 --> 01:07:44.703
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really liking what I see.

01:07:44.923 --> 01:07:48.984
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like one of these games I'm like, I think people totally missed this.

01:07:49.024 --> 01:07:50.205
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I know it has its fans.

01:07:50.565 --> 01:07:52.605
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard some people talking about it on Twitter and so forth.

01:07:52.665 --> 01:07:56.206
[SPEAKER_04]: But more people should be talking about Gravity Rush.

01:07:56.266 --> 01:07:58.007
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty great from what I've played of it so far.

01:07:58.667 --> 01:08:01.948
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a free one on PlayStation Plus and the Uncharted game, of course.

01:08:01.968 --> 01:08:02.448
[SPEAKER_03]: And Wipeout.

01:08:02.548 --> 01:08:04.989
[SPEAKER_03]: Wipeout was one of the best looking games that launched.

01:08:06.929 --> 01:08:10.732
[SPEAKER_04]: and Tactics PSP, which, you know, some of you might not have even bothered to pick up or whatever.

01:08:10.772 --> 01:08:11.352
[SPEAKER_04]: It's free.

01:08:11.592 --> 01:08:14.154
[SPEAKER_04]: So PlayStation Plus on Vita, looking nice right now.

01:08:14.214 --> 01:08:18.677
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have a Vita and you happen to have PlayStation Plus, I would really urge you to go check that free shit out.

01:08:19.418 --> 01:08:27.464
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you don't want to, the 2.0 upgrade allows the wireless transmissions, which is one of those, duh, this thing should have been there in the beginning and all those features, which is great.

01:08:27.784 --> 01:08:29.245
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

01:08:29.918 --> 01:08:34.842
[SPEAKER_04]: and Shadow Next Gen does want to say in chat, actually, PlayStation is losing Sony money right now.

01:08:35.223 --> 01:08:36.604
[SPEAKER_04]: The Vita has hurt them a lot.

01:08:36.684 --> 01:08:43.190
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mentioned the Vita earlier and I just, the sales in Japan and the US and everywhere really don't look good.

01:08:43.290 --> 01:08:53.999
[SPEAKER_03]: I think their opportunity with some of these games I think was that the company that worked on Resistance and did the Call of Duty Vita versions, it's

01:08:54.179 --> 01:08:55.799
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:09:18.405 --> 01:09:19.345
[SPEAKER_03]: Total crap.

01:09:19.885 --> 01:09:22.266
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's like, what happened to that?

01:09:22.366 --> 01:09:22.786
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it?

01:09:22.826 --> 01:09:28.388
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it Game Developers Conference or one of those where Sony just came out and said, we've got over 100 games coming to the Vita.

01:09:30.708 --> 01:09:31.168
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are they?

01:09:33.309 --> 01:09:33.769
[SPEAKER_04]: What happened?

01:09:35.330 --> 01:09:37.130
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy X, we're going to remake that.

01:09:37.670 --> 01:09:37.910
[SPEAKER_04]: When?

01:09:39.951 --> 01:09:40.291
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:09:41.791 --> 01:09:42.031
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh.

01:09:42.151 --> 01:09:43.272
[SPEAKER_04]: Are people abandoning ship?

01:09:43.312 --> 01:09:43.872
[SPEAKER_04]: What's happening?

01:09:44.152 --> 01:09:44.232
Oh.

01:09:45.714 --> 01:09:47.596
[SPEAKER_04]: Earth Defense Force 2017, Portable comes out.

01:10:02.552 --> 01:10:04.814
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:10:24.349 --> 01:10:27.650
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried playing that, and it's like, oh, hey, cool, it's not updating.

01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:29.151
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

01:10:30.011 --> 01:10:32.112
[SPEAKER_04]: It works all right for me.

01:10:33.072 --> 01:10:37.014
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I think I called it bubble wrap on last week's show, and that's pretty much what it is.

01:10:37.454 --> 01:10:38.615
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not really a game there.

01:10:38.675 --> 01:10:39.575
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just tap, tap, tap.

01:10:39.936 --> 01:10:41.616
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do combos.

01:10:42.497 --> 01:10:42.857
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on.

01:10:43.097 --> 01:10:45.998
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pressing squares to make them disappear.

01:10:46.058 --> 01:10:46.999
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not rocket science.

01:10:48.081 --> 01:10:49.523
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for watching!

01:11:06.405 --> 01:11:08.827
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, which is supposed to be a reinvention of Populous.

01:11:09.727 --> 01:11:18.833
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought, actually, I gotta be honest, as much as I think Curiosity is interesting and all, that was tacky as shit, having that Kickstarter in there.

01:11:19.673 --> 01:11:27.918
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't put it past Molyneux, though, you know, as the more I was thinking about it, I was like, that is so a thing for him to do.

01:11:28.618 --> 01:11:30.519
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, I just found that tacky as shit.

01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:31.340
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:40.106
[SPEAKER_04]: And regardless, I think it's neat that he's revisiting the Populous idea because I think that game in particular was a great game.

01:11:41.247 --> 01:11:44.149
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is something that he started a Kickstarter for.

01:11:44.349 --> 01:11:46.211
[SPEAKER_04]: It's available on, of course, Kickstarter.

01:11:47.752 --> 01:11:54.197
[SPEAKER_04]: They want 450,000 pounds to do the Rebirth of God games for PC only.

01:11:54.597 --> 01:11:56.058
[SPEAKER_04]: IOS, and Android.

01:11:57.340 --> 01:12:02.424
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can look at more details on the Kickstarter if you want about what all you can get from it.

01:12:02.804 --> 01:12:05.947
[SPEAKER_04]: But that is on his plate for games he wants to do.

01:12:06.467 --> 01:12:11.432
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought that 22 Cans had these other games lined up.

01:12:11.492 --> 01:12:12.653
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember reading about one.

01:12:12.693 --> 01:12:16.176
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought the next game was supposed to be Cooperation or something was supposed to be the next game for 22 Cans.

01:12:16.796 --> 01:12:18.016
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know where this fits into it.

01:12:18.177 --> 01:12:25.239
[SPEAKER_04]: If this is like an actual 22... Because remember, 22 cans is because Molyneux's got 22 ideas for iOS games.

01:12:26.679 --> 01:12:27.019
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:29.420
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know where this fits into it.

01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:34.042
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if this is one of the 22 or if this is like a bonus or what, but... No.

01:12:34.322 --> 01:12:35.742
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope it's as good as Populous.

01:12:35.802 --> 01:12:36.442
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's all I can say.

01:12:36.462 --> 01:12:37.423
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not giving him any money.

01:12:37.683 --> 01:12:37.783
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

01:12:39.375 --> 01:12:43.078
[SPEAKER_04]: I just... I was kind of turned off by the ad in Curiosity.

01:12:43.819 --> 01:12:46.141
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I don't... I can't explain it.

01:12:46.221 --> 01:12:47.642
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it just... It was tacky.

01:12:48.683 --> 01:12:49.003
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:12:49.344 --> 01:12:51.065
[SPEAKER_04]: It turned me off to Curiosity, too.

01:12:51.505 --> 01:12:52.907
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what we're tapping away at?

01:12:52.947 --> 01:12:54.548
[SPEAKER_04]: The big mystery in advertisement?

01:12:55.429 --> 01:12:55.729
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

01:12:57.050 --> 01:12:57.771
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, let's move on.

01:12:58.351 --> 01:12:58.812
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

01:12:59.833 --> 01:13:01.214
[SPEAKER_10]: My computer just did something bizarre.

01:13:01.334 --> 01:13:01.614
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on.

01:13:02.835 --> 01:13:03.215
[SPEAKER_10]: There we go.

01:13:04.076 --> 01:13:04.276
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

01:13:06.551 --> 01:13:18.621
[SPEAKER_10]: So, as was teased earlier when we talked to Bobby, there's a game that I'm super excited about that's coming out on the 3DS through the Nintendo eShop.

01:13:19.301 --> 01:13:22.364
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is Space Harrier!

01:13:23.164 --> 01:13:24.285
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay!

01:13:25.366 --> 01:13:30.509
[SPEAKER_10]: Mind you, it's not like I think the Sega Ages one.

01:13:30.689 --> 01:13:36.753
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a currently redone 3D version of Space Harrier.

01:13:37.354 --> 01:13:40.396
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm pretty excited about that because it's one of my favorite games ever.

01:13:41.196 --> 01:13:41.296
[SPEAKER_10]: And...

01:13:42.637 --> 01:13:46.320
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd actually, I think I've put it as like number three on my top games list.

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:52.204
[SPEAKER_10]: Like number one being The Guardian Legend, number two being Fantasy Zone, and number three being Space Harrier.

01:13:53.505 --> 01:13:55.346
[SPEAKER_10]: So, welcome to the Fantasy Zone.

01:13:55.806 --> 01:13:56.126
[SPEAKER_10]: Get ready.

01:13:58.008 --> 01:13:59.049
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you gotta get a 3DS.

01:14:01.390 --> 01:14:02.471
[SPEAKER_10]: You wanna know what's funny, Rob?

01:14:02.791 --> 01:14:04.973
[SPEAKER_10]: I have about seven versions of Space Harrier at home.

01:14:05.813 --> 01:14:06.854
[SPEAKER_04]: Tell me you don't want this one.

01:14:08.143 --> 01:14:08.844
[SPEAKER_11]: One of my Sega Ages 1s.

01:14:27.617 --> 01:14:29.758
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:14:45.166 --> 01:14:46.327
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much just a couple things.

01:14:46.827 --> 01:14:50.149
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got the American Mensa Academy on the 3DS.

01:14:51.949 --> 01:14:56.051
[SPEAKER_03]: Ratchet and Clank Full Frontal Assault on PS3.

01:14:58.032 --> 01:15:00.873
[SPEAKER_03]: Kids Learn and Play Pets and Vets on the DS.

01:15:03.374 --> 01:15:08.036
[SPEAKER_03]: And... I think that actually might be it.

01:15:08.997 --> 01:15:09.217
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

01:15:12.018 --> 01:15:16.519
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Scribblenot's Unlimited on PC because I guess that wasn't ready to go yet.

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:24.061
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, traveling to Japan, since it's a little different over there and they didn't really have Black Friday, you still have some games coming out in Japan.

01:15:24.762 --> 01:15:33.724
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting on the Xbox 360, you have Darksiders 2 comes out as well as Love Tor, Love Toray probably, mint version in limited and regular editions.

01:15:34.344 --> 01:15:36.685
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a sequel to Sweet.

01:15:37.965 --> 01:15:41.126
[SPEAKER_10]: For a moment, I thought you said Toire, which means toilet.

01:15:42.179 --> 01:15:42.819
[SPEAKER_04]: Love Toilet?

01:15:43.039 --> 01:15:43.300
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:45.741
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't think these girls are having fun in the Love Toilet.

01:15:45.761 --> 01:15:46.881
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it says, Toray.

01:15:46.901 --> 01:15:47.962
[SPEAKER_04]: Toray.

01:15:48.042 --> 01:15:48.322
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

01:15:48.682 --> 01:15:50.503
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me read the little description for this.

01:15:50.543 --> 01:15:51.243
[SPEAKER_04]: Hold on.

01:15:51.323 --> 01:15:52.024
[SPEAKER_04]: Go away, box art.

01:15:52.044 --> 01:15:53.304
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go back to the description here.

01:15:53.344 --> 01:15:55.285
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I would play a game called Love Toilet.

01:15:56.666 --> 01:15:57.967
[SPEAKER_04]: You are faced with a new problem.

01:15:57.987 --> 01:16:00.768
[SPEAKER_04]: The school wants you to win the National Dance Championship.

01:16:01.088 --> 01:16:04.970
[SPEAKER_04]: The girls are not used to disciplined practices and the student club president is against you.

01:16:05.410 --> 01:16:13.253
[SPEAKER_04]: The biggest problem, however, is that you enter the championship as pairs, and the girl you want to dance with would most certainly prefer pairing up with another girl than dancing with you.

01:16:13.654 --> 01:16:17.475
[SPEAKER_04]: However, protecting the club is your job, so swallow your pride and dance on.

01:16:17.755 --> 01:16:19.676
[SPEAKER_04]: This is like the plot to, like, Bring It On 3.

01:16:21.437 --> 01:16:23.258
[SPEAKER_12]: Box description, gigantic soulless eyes.

01:16:31.561 --> 01:16:31.961
[SPEAKER_12]: Kinda.

01:16:32.742 --> 01:16:34.863
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's move on to the PlayStation 3.

01:16:35.363 --> 01:16:41.265
[SPEAKER_04]: On the PlayStation 3, Darksiders 2 is there as well, as well as Power Smash 4 going into the Sega The Best collection.

01:16:41.905 --> 01:16:46.327
[SPEAKER_04]: Shinsengoku Musou Online Ryujin Oranbu 5th Anniversary Pack.

01:16:46.387 --> 01:16:50.269
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably just a repackaging of Shinsengoku.

01:16:50.909 --> 01:16:54.510
[SPEAKER_04]: Sports Champions 2 makes its way to Japan on the 29th as well.

01:16:55.030 --> 01:16:58.592
[SPEAKER_04]: And Dai 2G Super Robot Taisen Original Generations.

01:16:59.412 --> 01:17:02.035
[SPEAKER_04]: in the regular and Blu-ray disc box.

01:17:02.095 --> 01:17:04.037
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's probably one of them combo packs.

01:17:05.238 --> 01:17:16.310
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking at the PlayStation Vita this week, Fate Stay Night, Power Smash 4, price reduction there as well, and Samurai and Dragons, Ryuzoku Kuren.

01:17:17.623 --> 01:17:26.536
[SPEAKER_04]: as well as a new game called Totori no Atelier Plus, Arland no Renken Sushi 2 comes out over there as well.

01:17:26.797 --> 01:17:31.483
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry to interrupt, but is Samurais and Dragons pretty much their version of Cowboys and Aliens?

01:17:32.805 --> 01:17:33.585
[SPEAKER_04]: It very well might be.

01:17:33.645 --> 01:17:34.005
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:17:34.066 --> 01:17:34.366
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:17:34.726 --> 01:17:36.066
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard these Atelier games, though.

01:17:36.086 --> 01:17:38.027
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one of them on PlayStation 3 out here.

01:17:38.107 --> 01:17:40.188
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a few out on PlayStation 3 out here.

01:17:40.268 --> 01:17:40.888
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at these two.

01:17:41.908 --> 01:17:45.369
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think these two chicks who are embracing in this picture are wearing a top.

01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:46.710
[SPEAKER_04]: Just pointing out.

01:17:46.850 --> 01:17:47.330
[SPEAKER_04]: Or illegal.

01:17:48.190 --> 01:17:48.711
[SPEAKER_04]: Or illegal.

01:17:48.831 --> 01:17:49.331
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

01:17:49.731 --> 01:17:52.092
[SPEAKER_04]: They're embracing in a bathhouse, I'm sure.

01:17:53.312 --> 01:17:55.373
[SPEAKER_04]: The graphics look pretty, though, outside of that picture.

01:17:55.473 --> 01:17:56.854
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cel shading and all that.

01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:02.416
[SPEAKER_04]: Tatori brings her tools, her books, and everything colorful to the PS Vita.

01:18:02.796 --> 01:18:05.858
[SPEAKER_04]: Forget about saving the world, you have more important business to attend to.

01:18:06.278 --> 01:18:12.741
[SPEAKER_04]: Namely, collecting your ingredients, learning new recipes, creating powerful items, and completing missions set by the guild.

01:18:13.041 --> 01:18:15.963
[SPEAKER_04]: In this game where you have a schedule to follow, every moment counts.

01:18:16.363 --> 01:18:18.204
[SPEAKER_04]: You got served cross bring it on equals moe moe powa

01:18:41.625 --> 01:18:44.006
[SPEAKER_04]: On the Wii U in Japan, not yet.

01:18:44.267 --> 01:18:48.650
[SPEAKER_04]: December 8th is the big day, so we got another week to go before we talk about Wii U in Japan.

01:18:49.310 --> 01:18:54.694
[SPEAKER_04]: But we can talk about the Nintendo 3DS and Naruto SD Powerful Shippuden.

01:18:55.215 --> 01:18:57.276
[SPEAKER_04]: Because what would the week be without a Naruto game?

01:18:57.677 --> 01:18:59.838
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, Leighton Kaiju vs...

01:19:00.779 --> 01:19:03.201
[SPEAKER_04]: and Gaikoten Saiban comes out for level 5.

01:19:16.337 --> 01:19:18.920
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought this was a thing in development.

01:19:19.001 --> 01:19:21.544
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't realize this was coming out in Japan now.

01:19:21.564 --> 01:19:21.964
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

01:19:22.645 --> 01:19:23.827
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you watch the trailer for this?

01:19:24.227 --> 01:19:26.010
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I did a long time ago now that you talk about it.

01:19:26.030 --> 01:19:26.791
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty epic.

01:19:27.472 --> 01:19:27.972
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty cool.

01:19:29.134 --> 01:19:31.917
[SPEAKER_12]: Sort of semi-off topic, there is now a Phoenix Wright movie.

01:19:32.418 --> 01:19:32.979
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, oh yeah.

01:19:33.059 --> 01:19:33.359
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

01:19:35.061 --> 01:19:38.862
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully something will get here a little easier to obtain.

01:19:39.622 --> 01:19:42.723
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess the internet's not much easier than that, but you know.

01:19:43.904 --> 01:19:45.604
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's going to do it for Japanese releases.

01:19:45.664 --> 01:19:47.065
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go over to the UK, DarkSakura.

01:19:47.265 --> 01:19:49.746
[SPEAKER_10]: On the 26th, we have LEGO Lord of the Rings.

01:19:49.866 --> 01:19:53.827
[SPEAKER_10]: On the 27th, we have Battlefield 3 Aftermath and Mass Effect 3 Omega!

01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:57.563
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad that for DLC it gets its own release date.

01:19:57.983 --> 01:19:58.984
[SPEAKER_10]: That just makes me so happy.

01:19:59.664 --> 01:20:01.386
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they respect Mass Effect.

01:20:02.847 --> 01:20:10.934
[SPEAKER_10]: On the 20th of November, Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition, Miyazmata on PC, and Stealth Bastard Deluxe.

01:20:11.234 --> 01:20:13.075
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the best name, Stealth Bastard.

01:20:13.876 --> 01:20:15.457
[SPEAKER_10]: Or maybe it'd be Stealth Bastard.

01:20:16.999 --> 01:20:19.401
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, Eddie Izzard is to be believed.

01:20:21.050 --> 01:20:36.217
[SPEAKER_10]: On the 29th, Aeroporter on 3DS, the 30th, Ben 10 Omniverse, Epic Mickey 2, The Power of 2, Far Cry 3, FIFA 13, Little Inferno, Warriors Orochi 3 Hyper, the Wii U, Zone of the Enders HD Collection.

01:20:37.178 --> 01:20:43.001
[SPEAKER_10]: And let me see what I've got for if there's anything on December 1st.

01:20:43.041 --> 01:20:43.441
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold on.

01:20:44.542 --> 01:20:46.383
[SPEAKER_10]: God, I can't believe it's already almost December.

01:20:48.284 --> 01:20:48.924
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope, nothing until the 4th.

01:20:50.782 --> 01:20:54.143
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, just a couple more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

01:20:54.243 --> 01:20:54.903
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, Loki.

01:20:55.463 --> 01:20:55.643
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

01:20:56.243 --> 01:20:59.584
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk a little bit about Telltale Games.

01:21:00.024 --> 01:21:05.505
[SPEAKER_03]: And thankfully, it's not about them closing down, but actually, they're expanding starting spring 2013.

01:21:07.025 --> 01:21:11.366
[SPEAKER_03]: And what they're going to do is, I guess, they're moving out of their current office.

01:21:11.566 --> 01:21:15.767
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to, I guess, get an office that's almost twice as big.

01:21:16.627 --> 01:21:36.100
[SPEAKER_03]: and right now they're looking to um up their staff by looks like 35 people um starting in March and April of 2013 and I guess um that's good news that they're doing well so they've got you know of course a lot of games out right now they just finished up the second season of walking or I guess

01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:38.462
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're working on the second season of Walking Dead.

01:21:38.482 --> 01:21:39.924
[SPEAKER_03]: The first season just finished.

01:21:40.564 --> 01:21:47.091
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it should be coming out on a disc retail version two weeks from now.

01:21:49.253 --> 01:21:49.573
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty cool.

01:21:53.913 --> 01:21:57.293
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear great things about The Walking Dead.

01:21:57.513 --> 01:21:59.754
[SPEAKER_04]: I have heard so much good stuff about that.

01:21:59.774 --> 01:22:03.135
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people saying that's the game of the year right there is The Walking Dead.

01:22:03.595 --> 01:22:05.175
[SPEAKER_04]: I just haven't had a chance to play it.

01:22:05.195 --> 01:22:07.016
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so much stuff going on right now.

01:22:07.176 --> 01:22:10.297
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a new game every day.

01:22:10.757 --> 01:22:14.378
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want to take the time to sit down and play The Walking Dead at some point.

01:22:15.758 --> 01:22:20.159
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people on Twitter went so far as to say it is the best ending ever in a video game.

01:22:21.556 --> 01:22:22.336
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:22:46.127 --> 01:22:48.389
[SPEAKER_04]: Regardless, it sounds like it came out better than Jurassic Park.

01:22:48.870 --> 01:22:50.492
[SPEAKER_04]: But to be fair, I didn't play that either.

01:22:51.172 --> 01:22:52.674
[SPEAKER_10]: Now that song is stuck in my head.

01:22:52.914 --> 01:22:54.456
[SPEAKER_04]: What, Jurassic Park is Frightening in the Dark?

01:22:54.896 --> 01:22:57.559
[SPEAKER_10]: Jurassic Park is Frightening in the Dark.

01:22:58.340 --> 01:22:58.680
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:22:59.901 --> 01:23:00.322
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

01:23:00.782 --> 01:23:05.887
[SPEAKER_04]: One more on Ubisoft and a comment they made this week about this current console generation.

01:23:06.588 --> 01:23:10.811
[SPEAKER_04]: Ubisoft doesn't want the next console generation to go quite as long.

01:23:11.552 --> 01:23:13.773
[SPEAKER_04]: This was in a talk with Polygon.

01:23:14.434 --> 01:23:16.615
[SPEAKER_04]: I can never say this guy's name right.

01:23:16.675 --> 01:23:17.296
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry in advance.

01:23:17.556 --> 01:23:19.197
[SPEAKER_04]: Yves Guillemot?

01:23:19.217 --> 01:23:19.958
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:23:19.978 --> 01:23:22.019
[SPEAKER_04]: It's French.

01:23:22.059 --> 01:23:23.260
[SPEAKER_04]: How would you say that right there?

01:23:24.341 --> 01:23:24.721
[SPEAKER_10]: Wimote?

01:23:26.205 --> 01:23:26.745
[SPEAKER_04]: William Maltz?

01:23:26.886 --> 01:23:30.567
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, because that's basically... Y.V.S.

01:23:30.687 --> 01:23:31.348
[SPEAKER_04]: Guillemot.

01:23:33.669 --> 01:23:34.689
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would be Yves.

01:23:35.330 --> 01:23:37.071
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he's the CEO at Ubisoft.

01:23:37.231 --> 01:23:37.411
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

01:23:37.491 --> 01:23:37.991
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Yves.

01:23:38.071 --> 01:23:39.172
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha ha, I'm French.

01:23:39.592 --> 01:23:39.972
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop it.

01:23:40.352 --> 01:23:45.775
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, he's the CEO at Ubisoft, and he said that basically, you know, it's kind of taken a while for hardware to come out.

01:23:46.935 --> 01:23:51.057
[SPEAKER_04]: Quote, we are used to the changing machines every five years.

01:23:52.477 --> 01:23:59.259
[SPEAKER_04]: When a console is out for a long time, you don't take as much risks on totally new IPs because even if they are good, they don't sell as well.

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:06.182
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of an interesting comment because Zombie U is an Ubisoft game on the Wii U.

01:24:07.389 --> 01:24:08.030
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:24:27.873 --> 01:24:34.578
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's basically saying that when a console's out for a long time, you don't want to take risks because they don't sell as well.

01:24:37.140 --> 01:24:41.884
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the reason that it feels like this cycle has gone on way too long?

01:24:41.924 --> 01:24:44.166
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is that the rise of the mobile phone industry?

01:24:44.206 --> 01:24:44.787
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.

01:24:45.487 --> 01:24:49.851
[SPEAKER_04]: I really get bothered though when I keep seeing like, oh, traditional game companies.

01:24:50.191 --> 01:24:52.173
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw one article somewhere this week that was like,

01:24:52.873 --> 01:24:53.413
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for watching!

01:25:12.466 --> 01:25:15.609
[SPEAKER_04]: The Apple iPhone cannot game the way a console can.

01:25:15.629 --> 01:25:19.794
[SPEAKER_10]: When I get Mass Effect fully on my phone, maybe, but Infiltrator doesn't cut it.

01:25:20.214 --> 01:25:22.096
[SPEAKER_04]: Infiltrator kind of sucks.

01:25:22.156 --> 01:25:23.738
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it looks good, but the controls ruin it.

01:25:23.758 --> 01:25:26.141
[SPEAKER_04]: I touched it, but... The controls ruin it.

01:25:26.341 --> 01:25:27.302
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Rob, I touched it.

01:25:29.584 --> 01:25:29.744
[SPEAKER_04]: So...

01:25:34.068 --> 01:25:38.391
[SPEAKER_04]: How can the next console generation be shorter?

01:25:38.411 --> 01:25:42.434
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to sell consoles saying, oh, well, we'll have a new one out in just four years.

01:25:42.855 --> 01:25:48.119
[SPEAKER_04]: They kind of want to encourage people that this next console may have to be the last one they ever buy.

01:25:48.991 --> 01:25:50.191
[SPEAKER_04]: Although we all know that's not true.

01:25:50.231 --> 01:25:52.192
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you'll still be upgrading your PCs.

01:25:52.652 --> 01:25:58.434
[SPEAKER_04]: But even, you know, Alan kind of made a point the other day that even PC upgrades have kind of slowed a little bit.

01:25:59.095 --> 01:26:03.576
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, especially like now versus maybe where we were at 10 years ago in like the same time.

01:26:03.856 --> 01:26:06.457
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's, you know, we've kind of hit this cap.

01:26:08.158 --> 01:26:08.458
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

01:26:09.938 --> 01:26:10.218
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:26:11.419 --> 01:26:14.940
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Wolf in our chat room says, gaming on my TV will never die.

01:26:16.661 --> 01:26:17.261
[SPEAKER_04]: Amen to that.

01:26:18.727 --> 01:26:19.929
[SPEAKER_04]: I fucking hate that show.

01:26:19.969 --> 01:26:20.790
[SPEAKER_04]: I also hate Sons of Anarchy.

01:26:36.287 --> 01:26:38.609
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, yeah, okay, the acting in both are great.

01:26:38.910 --> 01:26:40.231
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate the subject matter.

01:26:40.831 --> 01:26:42.152
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate how the episodes go.

01:26:42.273 --> 01:26:48.939
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate basically awful, horrible people being put in a positive spotlight.

01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:54.203
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, okay, yeah, Hitler was an artist, but that doesn't mean I'm a fan.

01:26:55.384 --> 01:26:58.007
[SPEAKER_12]: Painting an apartment in one afternoon, two coats.

01:27:00.389 --> 01:27:01.970
[SPEAKER_04]: I only have time to watch RuPaul's Drag Race.

01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:02.730
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:27:04.951 --> 01:27:12.214
[SPEAKER_04]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on vognetwork.com, use the passphrase mouse.

01:27:13.295 --> 01:27:16.956
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's travel to a time when we didn't even have these mobile phones.

01:27:16.976 --> 01:27:19.177
[SPEAKER_04]: They were called car phones, not mobile phones.

01:27:19.197 --> 01:27:20.638
[SPEAKER_08]: Not even when this was out of date.

01:27:21.789 --> 01:27:22.149
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

01:27:37.862 --> 01:27:45.008
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think there's very many people that are going to judge you for doing another mother game.

01:27:45.048 --> 01:27:48.470
[SPEAKER_10]: This series is beloved by a lot of people.

01:28:07.867 --> 01:28:09.909
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I need to actually break out my copy and play it.

01:28:11.391 --> 01:28:13.453
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I do have this game.

01:28:14.174 --> 01:28:22.203
[SPEAKER_10]: But in Japan, it was Mother 2 Giga no Gyakushu, which I don't know what Gyakushu means, so somebody translate for me.

01:28:22.904 --> 01:28:23.905
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I knew that once.

01:28:25.406 --> 01:28:25.767
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably...

01:28:27.288 --> 01:28:28.049
[SPEAKER_12]: Giggs Revenge.

01:28:29.570 --> 01:28:30.270
[SPEAKER_10]: Something like that.

01:28:31.011 --> 01:28:36.434
[SPEAKER_10]: At any rate, when it came out with the Attract demo, there were two different names.

01:28:36.554 --> 01:28:41.758
[SPEAKER_10]: One was Earthbound, The War Against Giygas, and the other one was Mother 2.

01:28:44.260 --> 01:28:48.743
[SPEAKER_10]: However they've written it, G-Y-I-Y-G, that's a weird way to spell it, strikes back.

01:28:50.524 --> 01:28:56.708
[SPEAKER_10]: It was designed by Shigesato Itoi, and it was actually the sequel to Mother.

01:28:57.769 --> 01:29:00.112
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, he was the last boss in the game.

01:29:00.132 --> 01:29:01.394
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why he's named that.

01:29:03.097 --> 01:29:05.080
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, no, I know that was his name.

01:29:05.741 --> 01:29:07.163
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't know why they spelled it that way.

01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:09.611
[SPEAKER_10]: because it's very weird.

01:29:10.992 --> 01:29:26.745
[SPEAKER_10]: At any rate, the game was released on August 27, 1994 in Japan and in America as Earthbound on June 5, 1995 as a standalone, as not a sequel to anything because we didn't know.

01:29:26.825 --> 01:29:28.486
[SPEAKER_10]: Who did we have to import back then, huh?

01:29:29.027 --> 01:29:32.049
[SPEAKER_12]: We had Final Fantasy VI as Final Fantasy III.

01:29:32.109 --> 01:29:32.689
[SPEAKER_12]: Come on.

01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:33.190
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

01:29:33.210 --> 01:29:33.290
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

01:29:34.810 --> 01:29:38.071
[SPEAKER_10]: and then we had our Spoonie Bards in Final Fantasy 2-4.

01:29:38.492 --> 01:29:41.453
[SPEAKER_12]: Our beloved boldlerized translations.

01:29:42.033 --> 01:29:44.994
[SPEAKER_12]: It's actually evident in a few places in Earthbound.

01:29:45.415 --> 01:29:55.639
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, there's a sequence fairly close to the beginning where they replaced a, you know, beating sound with a scolding sound and, you know, that's, you know, your nemesis, basically.

01:29:55.679 --> 01:30:01.161
[SPEAKER_12]: He comes home and he gets his ass whipped by his parents, thus, you know, launching into the game proper, I think.

01:30:01.602 --> 01:30:01.902
Mm-hmm.

01:30:03.622 --> 01:30:06.764
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the game did not sell very well when it was new.

01:30:07.684 --> 01:30:21.811
[SPEAKER_10]: However, everyone loved it because they really liked the satire of American culture and the different parodies showing up for the RPG genre.

01:30:22.451 --> 01:30:25.073
[SPEAKER_12]: It's so quintessentially Japanese.

01:30:25.213 --> 01:30:28.254
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, there's just something so unique about it.

01:30:28.314 --> 01:30:31.916
[SPEAKER_12]: You could not have something like Mr. Saturn in an American game.

01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:33.581
[SPEAKER_10]: That's true.

01:30:34.302 --> 01:30:39.088
[SPEAKER_10]: I like Mr. Saturn in Smash Brothers because you can hit people with him.

01:30:39.949 --> 01:30:40.890
[SPEAKER_04]: Or the cultist.

01:30:40.930 --> 01:30:42.432
[SPEAKER_04]: That was my favorite part of the game.

01:30:42.473 --> 01:30:42.773
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, yes.

01:30:42.833 --> 01:30:43.374
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god.

01:30:43.854 --> 01:30:44.996
[SPEAKER_12]: That shit was hilarious.

01:30:45.537 --> 01:30:46.898
[SPEAKER_12]: Or a boss made out of vomit.

01:30:47.259 --> 01:30:47.519
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean...

01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:51.582
[SPEAKER_10]: I do like running around in your pajamas, but in the original, you were naked.

01:30:51.882 --> 01:30:52.223
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yes.

01:30:52.843 --> 01:30:56.465
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's just such a unique game.

01:30:56.585 --> 01:30:58.507
[SPEAKER_12]: That's one of the things that drew me toward it.

01:31:00.728 --> 01:31:08.853
[SPEAKER_10]: They had a sequel planned for the Nintendo 64DD, which was Earthbound 64, and it had been in development for a while before it was cancelled.

01:31:09.434 --> 01:31:13.296
[SPEAKER_10]: And then it came out as a GBA game called Mother 3.

01:31:13.596 --> 01:31:14.617
[SPEAKER_10]: It only came out in Japan.

01:31:15.077 --> 01:31:23.462
[SPEAKER_10]: However, there are fan translations, and it does have a very loose connection to Mother 2, but you can play it on its own.

01:31:24.162 --> 01:31:25.523
[SPEAKER_10]: There's actually a few returning characters.

01:31:26.143 --> 01:31:31.766
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, and you know, playing the prequel to it does make for a much richer experience.

01:31:31.866 --> 01:31:34.267
[SPEAKER_12]: It will punch you in the emotions, I assure you.

01:31:35.068 --> 01:31:35.988
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll get you in the feels.

01:31:36.268 --> 01:31:36.508
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

01:31:37.789 --> 01:31:43.454
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, it actually uses a kind of different sort of projection for playing the game.

01:31:43.534 --> 01:31:53.581
[SPEAKER_10]: It uses what's called oblique projection instead of the top-down, so that you're sort of skewed on a different level with all of the things around it.

01:31:54.642 --> 01:32:05.070
[SPEAKER_10]: So it gives the world, even though it is purely 2D, it gives it some sort of... It really makes it seamless as you go from place to place.

01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:09.833
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I think Pokemon uses kind of a similar... Pretty similar, yeah, style.

01:32:10.994 --> 01:32:18.760
[SPEAKER_10]: But I really liked its use of the color palette on the SNES, because I thought it was just gorgeous.

01:32:19.081 --> 01:32:19.881
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yes, yes.

01:32:20.922 --> 01:32:23.504
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not just color, it's how they use it.

01:32:23.524 --> 01:32:27.527
[SPEAKER_10]: It also doesn't use random encounters like the first Mother game did.

01:32:27.787 --> 01:32:28.968
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah.

01:32:29.209 --> 01:32:32.191
[SPEAKER_12]: And it is not every three steps like the original Mother.

01:32:32.891 --> 01:32:33.051
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

01:32:34.132 --> 01:32:40.054
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so basically, you know, you beat them down to zero, they, you know, for their hit points, they get killed.

01:32:40.454 --> 01:32:44.275
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you defeat a specific type of enemy, there's a chance you'll get an item.

01:32:44.935 --> 01:32:47.776
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, my favorite part about it was the rolling counter.

01:32:48.216 --> 01:32:52.617
[SPEAKER_12]: You, you know, you could get mortally hit and still finish a fight and live.

01:32:53.237 --> 01:33:00.199
[SPEAKER_12]: So if you gave yourself enough time, especially towards the end when you're, you know, upwards of 300 life, you know, that was pretty sweet.

01:33:02.019 --> 01:33:06.321
[SPEAKER_10]: I like how it compares your hit points box to an odometer.

01:33:07.141 --> 01:33:14.523
[SPEAKER_10]: And then of course you had your psi attacks that used your psychic points.

01:33:16.464 --> 01:33:17.644
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess PK fire.

01:33:19.806 --> 01:33:22.429
[SPEAKER_10]: I heard that way too many times playing Smash Bros.

01:33:22.710 --> 01:33:23.431
[SPEAKER_10]: PK Fire!

01:33:23.551 --> 01:33:24.192
[SPEAKER_10]: PK Fire!

01:33:36.429 --> 01:33:39.492
[SPEAKER_10]: And except for one character named Pooh, who can use a sword.

01:33:40.473 --> 01:33:41.794
[SPEAKER_12]: But that was only way at the end.

01:33:41.854 --> 01:33:45.177
[SPEAKER_12]: Towards, you know, for most of the game, he's just using his fists.

01:33:45.217 --> 01:33:46.718
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is like, what, a 12-year-old?

01:33:47.178 --> 01:33:48.740
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, give him props for that.

01:33:50.001 --> 01:33:51.162
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, when you're fighting, vomit.

01:33:52.763 --> 01:33:55.085
[SPEAKER_12]: And miniaturized UFOs wearing bows and...

01:33:56.354 --> 01:33:57.494
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, all sorts of critters.

01:33:57.934 --> 01:33:59.935
[SPEAKER_10]: You had all kinds of neat places in the game, too.

01:33:59.955 --> 01:34:07.137
[SPEAKER_10]: You had Onet, you know, Tucson, Threed, Foreside, you know, they were named.

01:34:07.297 --> 01:34:15.139
[SPEAKER_10]: You also had Winters, Summers, and Dalam, Scaraba, you know, different places that were meant to mimic different areas.

01:34:15.199 --> 01:34:16.340
[SPEAKER_04]: Highly creative names.

01:34:16.460 --> 01:34:16.800
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

01:34:20.223 --> 01:34:23.526
[SPEAKER_10]: And then you had to beat the Starmen and everything.

01:34:24.307 --> 01:34:27.130
[SPEAKER_10]: What I really like is looking at the concept art for this game.

01:34:27.751 --> 01:34:29.973
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you've ever seen any of the concept art for this.

01:34:30.093 --> 01:34:32.555
[SPEAKER_12]: It's quite whimsical and just making it beautiful.

01:34:32.596 --> 01:34:34.658
[SPEAKER_10]: It makes me think of a child's storybook.

01:34:35.018 --> 01:34:35.899
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yes, especially.

01:34:35.919 --> 01:34:37.661
[SPEAKER_10]: This would be a fucked up story.

01:34:39.342 --> 01:34:45.345
[SPEAKER_12]: My favorite was always Dungeon Man because you could see this really whimsical turn to it.

01:34:45.885 --> 01:34:47.886
[SPEAKER_12]: There's so much detail in it and so much life.

01:34:48.006 --> 01:34:50.527
[SPEAKER_12]: This is such a life-affirming game.

01:34:50.667 --> 01:34:52.888
[SPEAKER_12]: That's one reason I always went back to it.

01:34:56.890 --> 01:35:01.452
[SPEAKER_10]: Part of the dialogue for the final battle in this was actually...

01:35:03.392 --> 01:35:08.617
[SPEAKER_10]: I was reading, because this is something that I'd read before, about the military policemen and the dismembered beauty.

01:35:09.158 --> 01:35:21.369
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, and it's not actually a rape scene, as is often misquoted, but it's a sex scene which turns into a murder scene, which, you know, is not, it's not really a point for splitting many hairs, but...

01:35:21.989 --> 01:35:28.658
[SPEAKER_10]: But Itoi said that it had such an impact on him that he incorporated it into the game.

01:35:28.759 --> 01:35:30.541
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and it works really well.

01:35:30.601 --> 01:35:36.970
[SPEAKER_12]: It's very disjointed and it's kind of horrifying because there's just this sense of out-of-placeness there that you don't get in many games.

01:35:37.350 --> 01:35:44.075
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that when they marketed this in Japan, they actually used a member of SMOP to advertise the game.

01:35:45.235 --> 01:35:48.337
[SPEAKER_10]: They had scratches of stickers that came out with it.

01:35:48.377 --> 01:35:53.141
[SPEAKER_10]: They did all kinds of stuff with Weekly Famitsu to promote the hell out of this game.

01:35:53.181 --> 01:35:55.662
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, sadly, it didn't sell up to expectations.

01:35:56.303 --> 01:36:03.928
[SPEAKER_10]: But in America, it sold 140,000 copies and twice that many in Japan, which is still not all that great.

01:36:04.008 --> 01:36:05.969
[SPEAKER_10]: Not for how SNES games were selling at the time.

01:36:07.730 --> 01:36:10.632
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's like many things that are underappreciated when they're new.

01:36:11.312 --> 01:36:13.113
[SPEAKER_10]: They go back and get that cult status.

01:36:13.533 --> 01:36:13.873
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yes.

01:36:14.774 --> 01:36:18.896
[SPEAKER_10]: And now, you know, it's just considered one of the top games ever.

01:36:20.137 --> 01:36:24.939
[SPEAKER_10]: In 2006, there was a pull in Famitsu and it was rated the 37th best game of all time out of 100.

01:36:24.999 --> 01:36:31.963
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was listed from Gamasutra as one of the top 20 essential Japanese RPGs.

01:36:33.041 --> 01:36:40.950
[SPEAKER_04]: I really love this game for the record because, you know, and I remember playing this, I rented this at least like four times from the store and stuff like that, just playing the shit out of it.

01:36:42.932 --> 01:36:52.663
[SPEAKER_04]: One reason I really liked it is that, you know, I was really into Final Fantasy and all those games on Super Nintendo and this was very kind of, it was like that, but very, like it wasn't swords and sorcery and stuff, it was just like...

01:36:53.183 --> 01:36:55.324
[SPEAKER_04]: Kids being stupid, and I loved that.

01:36:55.524 --> 01:37:02.986
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it was very cartoonish, like the most cartoony thing you could really play on the Super Nintendo at the time, but yet it was like this Final Fantasy RPG.

01:37:03.406 --> 01:37:04.707
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I always really loved about it.

01:37:05.227 --> 01:37:07.147
[SPEAKER_10]: I really should break out my copy again and play it.

01:37:07.327 --> 01:37:07.808
[SPEAKER_10]: Good times.

01:37:08.568 --> 01:37:12.049
[SPEAKER_10]: But, yeah, I actually have, I believe this is one of the ones I have in the box.

01:37:13.009 --> 01:37:15.850
[SPEAKER_12]: I have to admit, I came into this afterwards.

01:37:16.150 --> 01:37:17.851
[SPEAKER_12]: This was not one of the ones we had on the console.

01:37:17.871 --> 01:37:23.132
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually completed this on emulator, so sorry if that disqualifies me as a serious gamer.

01:37:23.472 --> 01:37:26.513
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of people at this point have discovered it that way.

01:37:26.533 --> 01:37:28.654
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really hard to find it for less than $60.

01:37:30.314 --> 01:37:47.763
[SPEAKER_12]: But at the same time, I feel kind of glad that it's found such popularity on an emulator because it has reached a much wider audience and it does make for a richer experience that you can get it out to different people and you find all these little secrets and things you hadn't seen before.

01:37:47.803 --> 01:37:48.763
[SPEAKER_12]: Did you see the embryos?

01:37:50.174 --> 01:37:53.259
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, in the very last stage... I've seen that, yeah, but you know what?

01:37:53.339 --> 01:37:55.021
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think that is intentional.

01:37:55.061 --> 01:37:56.904
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, I don't think that's an intentional design thing.

01:37:56.924 --> 01:38:01.931
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a bit like, you know, the backwards tribute to Satan in a Led Zeppelin song.

01:38:01.972 --> 01:38:04.936
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but I could... But given Itoi's...

01:38:06.599 --> 01:38:07.060
[SPEAKER_10]: History?

01:38:07.420 --> 01:38:09.423
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe I could see it happening.

01:38:09.604 --> 01:38:11.887
[SPEAKER_12]: I just don't know how you intentionally get that.

01:38:12.147 --> 01:38:14.390
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it's not just one static image.

01:38:14.451 --> 01:38:16.413
[SPEAKER_12]: It's sort of a rolling thing.

01:38:16.514 --> 01:38:17.074
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a tile.

01:38:18.476 --> 01:38:19.838
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's moving.

01:38:20.319 --> 01:38:21.160
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't know.

01:38:23.354 --> 01:38:36.727
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, at any rate, for other things that have happened with the series, of course, definitely Ness and other characters have shown up in the Super Smash Bros.

01:38:36.767 --> 01:38:37.167
[SPEAKER_10]: series.

01:38:39.389 --> 01:38:42.172
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Ness was a hidden character, but everyone freaking used him.

01:38:42.812 --> 01:38:53.659
[SPEAKER_10]: and, um, Onet was actually a stage in Brawl and New Pork City in Mother 3 showed up in Brawl as well with the Chimera to the rejoice of all who wanted to see it in 3D.

01:38:54.060 --> 01:38:54.280
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

01:38:55.241 --> 01:39:02.645
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, there were also trophies for Paula, Jeff, and Pooh and, um, Jeff is an assist trophy in Super Smash Bros.

01:39:02.686 --> 01:39:12.232
[SPEAKER_10]: Brawl and, uh, his, uh, multi-bottle rockets were involved as well and Mr. Saturn, you could throw him at people because that was awesome.

01:39:13.232 --> 01:39:15.913
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, why was, Mr. Saturn should have been our Pikachu.

01:39:16.653 --> 01:39:26.996
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Saturn, however, you got special, um, it was like, you got an achievement for Mr. Saturn love, or you got points for it, when you let him wander around the screen and didn't throw him at people.

01:39:28.236 --> 01:39:29.017
[SPEAKER_10]: I always thought it was funny.

01:39:29.297 --> 01:39:30.817
[SPEAKER_12]: And Mr. Saturn only wants to help.

01:39:31.437 --> 01:39:34.178
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't help it that he's just a butt on legs, with a bow.

01:39:35.258 --> 01:39:36.039
[SPEAKER_12]: A butt on, yeah.

01:39:37.279 --> 01:39:48.023
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, at any rate, like I said earlier, there was supposed to be a sequel in 96 on the 64DD, but it kept having production problems and didn't show at E3 and other gaming conventions.

01:39:48.443 --> 01:39:56.466
[SPEAKER_10]: So Nintendo cancelled it on August 21st, 2000, but it resurfaced as a GBA title and it was only released in Japan.

01:39:57.106 --> 01:40:01.208
[SPEAKER_10]: And also Itoi said he had no more plans to develop the series any further.

01:40:02.328 --> 01:40:08.116
[SPEAKER_10]: There was an ESRB rating that said that it might come out on Wii but there are still no official plans.

01:40:09.306 --> 01:40:21.651
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want to give further props to the fan translation community because in their fight to translate this, they also found a lot of cool, like, kind of unused things.

01:40:22.172 --> 01:40:25.593
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, just sort of, you know, artifacts that were left in the data.

01:40:26.013 --> 01:40:26.193
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

01:40:26.354 --> 01:40:27.554
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, unfortunately, no.

01:40:27.654 --> 01:40:38.259
[SPEAKER_12]: Just things that, you know, unused bosses and unused sprites that just, they make you wonder at how, you know, what was originally planned for this because, you know, there were a few places...

01:40:39.619 --> 01:40:43.721
[SPEAKER_12]: The creator said he actually had to scale it back a bit because it was frightening him.

01:40:44.341 --> 01:40:49.983
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm of course referring to the extended mushroom trip, like sort of halfway through the game.

01:40:50.043 --> 01:40:54.324
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually need to sit down and play level 3 because I just haven't had time.

01:40:54.564 --> 01:40:58.125
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, there's an extended mushroom trip and the final boss.

01:40:58.145 --> 01:40:59.386
[SPEAKER_12]: I like extended mushroom trips.

01:40:59.446 --> 01:41:04.808
[SPEAKER_12]: The final boss, there is an unused boss battle, which I think it's available on YouTube, which...

01:41:06.068 --> 01:41:10.090
[SPEAKER_12]: is deeply unsettling, despite my lack of understanding Japanese.

01:41:11.031 --> 01:41:17.954
[SPEAKER_12]: But as it stands, the Mother 3 game is a very emotionally engaging and rich game, I find.

01:41:18.414 --> 01:41:24.297
[SPEAKER_12]: It's got its predecessor's balance of horror and just awesomeness.

01:41:25.618 --> 01:41:28.079
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, this also I think is kind of cool.

01:41:28.299 --> 01:41:37.083
[SPEAKER_10]: The sound designer for Earthbound, Keiichi Suzuki, he actually said that the biggest influence for the music for him was John Lennon.

01:41:37.904 --> 01:41:38.304
[SPEAKER_10]: Excellent.

01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:41.801
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, in the YouTube we're watching here, I just saw a reference to the Beatles.

01:41:42.161 --> 01:41:43.602
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's like one of those funny little jokes.

01:41:43.642 --> 01:41:47.043
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, do you know the name of this Beatles song?

01:41:47.603 --> 01:41:49.203
[SPEAKER_04]: Blank, blank, blank, today.

01:41:49.664 --> 01:41:51.364
[SPEAKER_04]: And your options are yes and no.

01:41:51.484 --> 01:41:54.105
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's a funny joke because you can say yes.

01:41:54.605 --> 01:41:55.005
[SPEAKER_04]: You're right.

01:41:55.105 --> 01:41:55.766
[SPEAKER_04]: It's yesterday.

01:41:55.786 --> 01:41:56.626
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

01:41:56.986 --> 01:42:02.568
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, music references, sadly, are one of the reasons they'd have trouble releasing Mother 3 in the U.S.

01:42:03.309 --> 01:42:07.831
[SPEAKER_12]: Because there is the Runaway 5 in Earthbound.

01:42:08.151 --> 01:42:13.833
[SPEAKER_12]: It was actually originally kind of a Blues Brother-y tribute, which it's kind of evident in the finished product of the game.

01:42:13.913 --> 01:42:18.495
[SPEAKER_12]: But I can't remember, it's the DMC or something like that?

01:42:18.975 --> 01:42:19.456
[SPEAKER_10]: There's Pinball.

01:42:19.476 --> 01:42:20.016
[SPEAKER_10]: I just called Pinball.

01:42:20.056 --> 01:42:20.876
[SPEAKER_10]: I forgot there were Pinball.

01:42:20.896 --> 01:42:21.837
[SPEAKER_10]: There's Pinball in the arcade.

01:42:21.897 --> 01:42:22.237
[SPEAKER_10]: Sweet.

01:42:23.021 --> 01:42:29.403
[SPEAKER_12]: but there's also the band in Mother 3 is also kind of clearly ripped off another band.

01:42:32.404 --> 01:42:33.345
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's the game.

01:42:34.305 --> 01:42:38.827
[SPEAKER_10]: Mother 2 slash Earthbound with strong hints towards Mother 3.

01:42:40.387 --> 01:42:42.008
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.

01:42:42.148 --> 01:42:47.130
[SPEAKER_04]: Earthbound, Mother 2 and a little dash of Mother 3 but we have to save that for another week.

01:42:47.150 --> 01:42:48.450
[SPEAKER_10]: We should do a Gaiden version called Daddy.

01:42:50.612 --> 01:42:52.914
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow, that's going to do it for Part A, but don't go anywhere.

01:42:52.954 --> 01:42:53.996
[SPEAKER_04]: We have plenty more to come.

01:42:54.176 --> 01:42:56.779
[SPEAKER_04]: We may not have a whole lot of news, but we do have the rapid-fire news.

01:42:57.139 --> 01:43:04.968
[SPEAKER_04]: We have your Fugo Question of the Week coming up as well, Mailbag, and Match Game coming back tonight in Part B. Don't go anywhere, guys.

01:43:04.988 --> 01:43:08.292
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:43:14.423 --> 01:43:23.331
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live here on November the 25th of 2012 with the 483rd episode of our show.

01:43:24.032 --> 01:43:27.836
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit of a slower news week this week, but that's alright.

01:43:27.896 --> 01:43:33.581
[SPEAKER_04]: We still have some news stories to talk about, including the rapid fire news, which is coming up right now.

01:43:33.821 --> 01:43:34.062
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

01:43:34.082 --> 01:43:34.462
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki.

01:43:34.782 --> 01:43:34.962
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

01:43:35.523 --> 01:43:39.806
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's talk about my favorite gaming series, Grand Theft Auto.

01:43:40.386 --> 01:43:47.471
[SPEAKER_03]: Grand Theft Auto had a wonderful release on iOS and Android of Grand Theft Auto 3 celebrating the 10th anniversary earlier this year.

01:43:47.852 --> 01:43:49.353
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe even been last year, can't remember.

01:43:50.233 --> 01:44:02.801
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but, soon enough, you'll be able to get some more Grand Theft Auto Love on your portable devices with Grand Theft Auto Vice City, the HD treatment for the 10th anniversary of that game as well.

01:44:03.002 --> 01:44:07.184
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm hoping that San Andreas is only a couple more years away.

01:44:08.025 --> 01:44:17.471
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, that'll be available on, um, December 6th, and apparently it's gonna cost you $5 on, uh, both Android or iOS.

01:44:19.690 --> 01:44:20.971
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fantastic.

01:44:21.391 --> 01:44:22.451
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot wait.

01:44:23.311 --> 01:44:25.452
[SPEAKER_03]: Except I can, because I'm not actually going to play it on the phone.

01:44:26.893 --> 01:44:29.774
[SPEAKER_03]: Because gaming on the phone sucks.

01:44:30.574 --> 01:44:42.359
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, to kind of go along with that, there's kind of a fan campaign to try to get Grand Theft Auto V onto PC and the Wii U. And, of course, developers are like, well, they're...

01:44:42.779 --> 01:45:02.374
[SPEAKER_03]: anything is up for consideration of course they haven't announced anything and um you know right now they're mainly focused on getting the game out on you know the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 it's hard to say if there's actually going to be a PC version for the game seeing as that you know there wasn't one for Red Dead Redemption although there was one for L.A.

01:45:02.394 --> 01:45:07.878
[SPEAKER_03]: Noire so it's I don't know it'd be kind of cool if it was on PC because that game looks fantastic and

01:45:10.498 --> 01:45:11.058
[SPEAKER_03]: Bayonetta DLC Japan

01:45:40.757 --> 01:46:03.138
[SPEAKER_03]: is coming to North America however it's coming to North America as a GameStop exclusive and I guess it will be kind of a day one limited edition also in Europe the US you're going to have to wait until you know comes out in January and if you really want that DLC you're going to have to wait until you know wait and purchase it from GameStop

01:46:04.139 --> 01:46:05.660
[SPEAKER_03]: And the game is supposed to be a lot cheaper.

01:46:05.700 --> 01:46:08.543
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only $29.99 as opposed to a full price game.

01:46:09.724 --> 01:46:14.788
[SPEAKER_03]: It is kind of disappointing though that GameStop locked in the DLC for that.

01:46:15.368 --> 01:46:15.969
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate that.

01:46:16.629 --> 01:46:16.949
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

01:46:17.009 --> 01:46:17.670
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, never know.

01:46:17.710 --> 01:46:18.991
[SPEAKER_03]: That stuff could come out later on.

01:46:19.031 --> 01:46:19.912
[SPEAKER_03]: They could sell it later.

01:46:20.312 --> 01:46:26.617
[SPEAKER_03]: But just, you know, throwing GameStop a bone, I guess, and giving them exclusive DLC.

01:46:27.038 --> 01:46:27.918
[SPEAKER_03]: Not going to hold my breath.

01:46:28.659 --> 01:46:28.779
Yeah.

01:46:30.515 --> 01:46:31.635
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, moving on.

01:46:32.156 --> 01:46:32.876
[SPEAKER_04]: This is pretty good.

01:46:32.936 --> 01:46:37.158
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I know we've talked about some Vita hardships, but there's a lot of good stuff to talk about on Vita right now.

01:46:37.258 --> 01:46:39.599
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just the free games, but price reductions.

01:46:40.219 --> 01:46:45.681
[SPEAKER_04]: November 27th is going to see some price reductions on the PlayStation Network for the download.

01:46:45.701 --> 01:46:51.143
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you have a memory card large enough to hold some games, you can get some games for a lot cheaper than they used to be for $17.99.

01:46:53.384 --> 01:47:00.829
[SPEAKER_04]: Hot Shots Golf, Little Deviants, MLB 12 The Show, Mod Nation Racers, Reality Fighters, and Wipeout 2048.

01:47:01.430 --> 01:47:06.173
[SPEAKER_04]: $26.99, Resistance Burning Skies, Smart Ass, not to be confused with Smart Ass, and Unit 13.

01:47:06.713 --> 01:47:13.338
[SPEAKER_04]: And then $35.99 for Uncharted Golden Abyss, but as mentioned before, you could get that free with PlayStation Plus.

01:47:13.358 --> 01:47:20.403
[SPEAKER_04]: You would just have to kind of juggle like, you know, remember when you are on PlayStation Plus, if you let your account lapse, you'll lose all those free games.

01:47:20.803 --> 01:47:23.825
[SPEAKER_04]: So you kind of have to weigh, is that something I really want to be locked into?

01:47:24.086 --> 01:47:31.711
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mind it, personally, because the games I'm getting for free aren't things that, like, if I really want a game bad enough that I can revisit whenever, I'll buy it.

01:47:32.772 --> 01:47:37.515
[SPEAKER_04]: But I like that PlayStation Plus kind of allows me to play games I might have missed from a couple years ago.

01:47:37.715 --> 01:47:38.756
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know.

01:47:38.876 --> 01:47:45.181
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to sound like a mouthpiece for Sony, but I'm glad to see that they're reducing the price of some of these games.

01:47:46.001 --> 01:47:47.402
[SPEAKER_04]: Might be what the system needs right now.

01:47:48.803 --> 01:48:17.140
[SPEAKER_04]: Darkstalker Resurrection Some folks looking forward to this This is the Darkstalker games for Xbox Live and Playstation Network There's also going to be a new tournament and online tournament mode coming in the game This is according to Capcom Unity The online mode is going to support 8 players Sudden Death, One Takes All, Best of 2 or Best of 3 Resurrection will also include the usual ranked and player matches Resurrection of course being the name of this download game

01:48:18.301 --> 01:48:18.921
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty cool there.

01:48:19.201 --> 01:48:23.565
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can do replays on YouTube, so can't wait for YouTube to get flooded with this stuff.

01:48:24.505 --> 01:48:25.186
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's pretty cool.

01:48:25.206 --> 01:48:30.430
[SPEAKER_04]: $14.99 on PlayStation Network, 1,200 Microsoft points on Xbox Live Arcade when it comes out in 2013.

01:48:31.731 --> 01:48:35.834
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're a fan of Half Minute Hero, maybe you're wondering when are we getting Half Minute Hero 2?

01:48:36.895 --> 01:48:41.919
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, marvelous producer Esteban Salazar told Siliconera that...

01:48:42.339 --> 01:48:49.701
[SPEAKER_04]: quote, it's considerably more expensive to put out the sequel, and they need to sell a lot more of the first game on PC to begin to justify it.

01:48:50.782 --> 01:48:56.343
[SPEAKER_04]: If this is something you're interested in, you might want to quote, encourage your friends to buy the Steam version, or buy it for them.

01:48:57.264 --> 01:48:59.604
[SPEAKER_04]: P.S., the game's 40% off on Steam right now.

01:48:59.885 --> 01:49:03.126
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, that wasn't in the quote, but that sure seemed to be convenient.

01:49:03.706 --> 01:49:05.506
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yep, you want Half Minute Hero 2?

01:49:06.367 --> 01:49:07.887
[SPEAKER_04]: Buy Part 1 for friends.

01:49:08.767 --> 01:49:09.848
[SPEAKER_04]: Half Minute Hero was kind of fun.

01:49:11.843 --> 01:49:17.071
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm not going to cry if the sequel never comes out, but I'm surprised it didn't sell enough to necessitate the sequel.

01:49:17.812 --> 01:49:18.333
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

01:49:19.274 --> 01:49:19.875
[SPEAKER_10]: Stuff happened.

01:49:19.915 --> 01:49:20.156
[SPEAKER_10]: The end.

01:49:20.176 --> 01:49:20.676
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm kidding.

01:49:21.918 --> 01:49:23.541
[SPEAKER_10]: For fans of the...

01:49:26.781 --> 01:49:42.948
[SPEAKER_10]: of the AM2 games they are going to be out on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network during the week we have Fighting Vipers Sonic the Fighters which I'm more excited about and Virtua Fighter 2 which I could give less than a crap about but I'm usually very alone in that

01:49:44.429 --> 01:49:48.451
[SPEAKER_10]: The games are going to have their own achievements and trophies and will support online multiplayer.

01:49:49.071 --> 01:49:59.697
[SPEAKER_10]: They will be about five bucks each and about 4.49 euro in Europe.

01:49:59.877 --> 01:50:04.860
[SPEAKER_10]: So they'll be out on November 27th in North America and December 5th in Europe.

01:50:07.003 --> 01:50:10.366
[SPEAKER_10]: Man, I have Fighter's Megamix at home.

01:50:11.067 --> 01:50:15.831
[SPEAKER_10]: And I wish that they would update Fighter's Megamix.

01:50:15.851 --> 01:50:16.491
[SPEAKER_10]: Wouldn't that be awesome?

01:50:17.652 --> 01:50:22.236
[SPEAKER_10]: So anyway, Capcom's also getting back into more fighting game stuff.

01:50:22.296 --> 01:50:25.599
[SPEAKER_10]: They've registered the name Fighters of Capcom.

01:50:25.719 --> 01:50:26.820
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a trademark, actually.

01:50:27.661 --> 01:50:31.985
[SPEAKER_10]: And they haven't really said what it's about, but...

01:50:33.524 --> 01:50:34.424
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it'll be good.

01:50:35.245 --> 01:50:35.665
[SPEAKER_10]: Hopefully.

01:50:36.845 --> 01:50:47.210
[SPEAKER_10]: And moving forward, on the Korean ratings board, Resident Evil Revelations has been listed for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:52.592
[SPEAKER_10]: So that means we might actually be getting the version out for the bigger consoles.

01:50:52.892 --> 01:50:53.212
[SPEAKER_10]: Who knows?

01:50:54.373 --> 01:50:54.973
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is that.

01:50:56.153 --> 01:50:56.453
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:50:56.934 --> 01:50:59.795
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's take a trip over to Facebook and Google+.

01:50:59.995 --> 01:51:02.436
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you slam those words together, you get Boogle.

01:51:09.966 --> 01:51:11.067
[SPEAKER_04]: The Google Question of the Week.

01:51:11.107 --> 01:51:15.210
[SPEAKER_04]: We ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities and look for some answers.

01:51:15.891 --> 01:51:19.974
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, it's got to be about the Wii U again this week, but with good reason.

01:51:20.835 --> 01:51:28.661
[SPEAKER_04]: This is about kind of how we're feeling post-launch of the Wii U. Here's the question from our Facebook community at Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio and our Google Plus community.

01:51:28.681 --> 01:51:29.621
[SPEAKER_04]: Search for Orange Launch Radio.

01:51:30.482 --> 01:51:38.526
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that the console has been out for a week, have you found that your opinion has changed on the Wii U from the pre-release hype?

01:51:38.786 --> 01:51:42.767
[SPEAKER_04]: Perhaps you weren't so excited about it before, but you ended up buying one for a reason.

01:51:43.308 --> 01:51:47.370
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you were really excited after E3, but found that maybe it'll hold off for a while.

01:51:47.470 --> 01:51:49.550
[SPEAKER_04]: Why did or didn't your opinion change?

01:51:50.491 --> 01:51:52.572
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to some comments first off from Facebook.

01:51:53.706 --> 01:51:54.907
[SPEAKER_04]: Wicked said, Wow, I was wrong.

01:52:14.554 --> 01:52:19.976
[SPEAKER_04]: The graphics are definitely top notch and the Wii's usual stigma of waggle wand was significantly downplayed.

01:52:20.336 --> 01:52:25.298
[SPEAKER_04]: The games are amazing, especially Zombie U and Nintendo Land which could easily be the party game of the year.

01:52:25.778 --> 01:52:34.021
[SPEAKER_04]: As lukewarm as I was for the Wii U, I must say after having it in my hands, which the tablet controller feels perfectly fine in, I am definitely on the bandwagon now.

01:52:35.301 --> 01:52:40.126
[SPEAKER_04]: VirtualPhil said I was excited for it but also a bit meh regarding the annoying hype.

01:52:40.547 --> 01:52:46.713
[SPEAKER_04]: However, now that I've played the console and have had a ton of fun with Nintendo Land's multiplayer games, I'm loving it.

01:52:47.093 --> 01:52:49.535
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wish the catalog of games was bigger from the outset.

01:52:50.456 --> 01:52:51.337
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkCharger said,

01:53:11.747 --> 01:53:16.930
[SPEAKER_04]: Doug T said, I'm holding off on buying the Wii U. I'm waiting for more high-quality first-party games.

01:53:17.110 --> 01:53:22.773
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a PS3, which is my favorite console, so when games are released on all three consoles, I'll buy it for my PS3.

01:53:23.313 --> 01:53:27.415
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I was disappointed with my Wii, so I'm waiting to see how the Wii U does over time.

01:53:28.615 --> 01:53:33.658
[SPEAKER_04]: AZHP said, before the console launched, I was really hopeful that Nintendo had figured out online.

01:53:34.178 --> 01:53:35.699
[SPEAKER_04]: Pause for Loki to scoff.

01:53:37.810 --> 01:53:39.651
[SPEAKER_03]: They figured out that it's there.

01:53:40.911 --> 01:53:41.831
[SPEAKER_03]: How to use it, maybe.

01:53:42.431 --> 01:53:56.235
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that I'm hearing reports of how purchases are tied to the console instead of the Mii profile, that there are separate wallets for Wii and Wii U online purchases that are on the same console, and that profiles can't be transferred between consoles, I'm just disappointed in Nintendo.

01:53:56.756 --> 01:53:59.916
[SPEAKER_04]: The 360 did online right, and they did it seven years ago.

01:54:00.137 --> 01:54:01.017
[SPEAKER_04]: Shame on Nintendo.

01:54:02.638 --> 01:54:12.225
[SPEAKER_04]: This answer is a little lengthy from Degenerate Johnny, so I'm not going to read the whole thing, but basically said, you know, when Reggie said that they're going to cater to hardcore gamers, he was very excited.

01:54:12.606 --> 01:54:19.972
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that it's launched, my anticipation dropped considerably, partially because the console lacks focus on achievement and trophy system.

01:54:21.007 --> 01:54:23.028
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo did this for the benefit of the developers.

01:54:24.048 --> 01:54:28.770
[SPEAKER_04]: And he kind of goes on to talk about how it's like a standard thing now, how Blizzard and all this does this.

01:54:29.731 --> 01:54:38.275
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of disappointed they missed the boat on that too, especially because, you know, on the 3DS, they have the whole accomplishments thing in the plaza.

01:54:38.415 --> 01:54:40.355
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought they were going this direction.

01:54:40.916 --> 01:54:42.296
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's... Oops.

01:54:43.917 --> 01:54:45.298
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not ready for the mailbag yet.

01:54:45.338 --> 01:54:46.178
[SPEAKER_04]: Be quiet, music.

01:54:47.639 --> 01:54:48.159
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.

01:54:48.799 --> 01:54:49.620
[SPEAKER_04]: Live radio, it's fun.

01:54:52.310 --> 01:54:56.293
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I don't think it's a deal breaker for the system.

01:54:56.353 --> 01:55:00.196
[SPEAKER_04]: It's disappointing, but what do you want to bet it's one of those things that just suddenly shows up later?

01:55:01.937 --> 01:55:02.297
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

01:55:05.347 --> 01:55:15.553
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at some of the comments in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com BlackWolf said, to be fair, Nintendo said that you'll be able to transfer profiles yourself soon and that they can already transfer them if you call them.

01:55:15.974 --> 01:55:21.857
[SPEAKER_04]: But yes, it's not there on launch day because obviously we all bought multiple Wii U's and really want to be able to transfer our profiles in the first week.

01:55:22.718 --> 01:55:28.441
[SPEAKER_04]: BlackWolf, again, it's the whole they're building it as they go along and how obvious is it?

01:55:28.782 --> 01:55:29.362
[SPEAKER_04]: Just saying.

01:55:36.181 --> 01:55:46.427
[SPEAKER_04]: Pete Garuno says, I was cautiously optimistic when it was announced, indifferent when more details emerged, but then I tried a demo unit and could see the potential.

01:55:46.968 --> 01:55:55.493
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my friends bought it on launch, and seeing the social aspects of sending picture messages, asking other players for help on a specific point is kind of selling it for me.

01:55:56.033 --> 01:56:01.596
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't really justify the purchase at the moment though, so it's currently on my wait for a major price reduction pile.

01:56:03.336 --> 01:56:09.019
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see, going to Codeman, I haven't bought one yet, but I've played with one here and they're at different electronic stores.

01:56:09.439 --> 01:56:13.641
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to say that the tech is pretty cool and being a designer, the interface is well done as well.

01:56:14.141 --> 01:56:19.844
[SPEAKER_04]: What's keeping me from buying it though is I don't believe Nintendo is done with it and tried to rush it out before the holiday season.

01:56:20.264 --> 01:56:23.966
[SPEAKER_04]: So until everything is working correctly, I would love to get my hands on one.

01:56:25.026 --> 01:56:28.230
[SPEAKER_04]: The only flaw in your logic I see is that, again, it's about the games.

01:56:29.151 --> 01:56:34.036
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not necessarily about the hardware or even the firmware that's on said hardware.

01:56:34.136 --> 01:56:41.425
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if they're writing that as they go along, it's weird, but it's not really a deal breaker if Mario HD is still going to be Mario HD at the end of the day.

01:56:41.805 --> 01:56:42.306
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about that.

01:56:42.366 --> 01:56:42.946
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm saying.

01:56:44.147 --> 01:56:53.394
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can see what he's saying, though, because if you look at the Wii, remember the Wii came out, and then they're all, oh, Motion Plus, because, you know, we really wanted these controllers more sensitive.

01:56:53.735 --> 01:56:56.217
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we have Wii Motion Plus, and oh, you bought Motion Plus?

01:56:56.657 --> 01:56:57.057
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

01:56:57.117 --> 01:57:00.180
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we have this fancy controller that already has it incorporated into it.

01:57:00.260 --> 01:57:01.000
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

01:57:01.361 --> 01:57:07.045
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait, now we need this other controller to do something, and you need that for this game, and...

01:57:08.346 --> 01:57:08.946
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fair.

01:57:09.166 --> 01:57:09.566
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fair.

01:57:09.986 --> 01:57:10.667
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand that.

01:57:10.707 --> 01:57:13.067
[SPEAKER_04]: The whole Wii Motion Plus or the Vitality Sensor.

01:57:13.167 --> 01:57:13.547
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh.

01:57:14.407 --> 01:57:14.687
[SPEAKER_04]: LOL.

01:57:15.247 --> 01:57:16.188
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Google Plus time.

01:57:16.988 --> 01:57:19.908
[SPEAKER_04]: Evil says, Hype level has generally been the same.

01:57:20.168 --> 01:57:22.629
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, it's E3VL, but it says evil to me.

01:57:23.129 --> 01:57:24.829
[SPEAKER_04]: Hype level has been generally the same.

01:57:25.610 --> 01:57:28.530
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo's consoles will always be my go-to for first-party content.

01:57:28.670 --> 01:57:36.732
[SPEAKER_04]: My only concern is that if the Wii U will be my main console after Microsoft and Sony releases their next system, seeing if Nintendo is consistent with quality of third-party ports.

01:57:37.632 --> 01:57:39.473
[SPEAKER_04]: Redertainment says, My opinion has not changed.

01:57:39.833 --> 01:57:45.494
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have priorities that are higher on my list than buying a Wii U. It's not that I think a Wii U would be a good buy or a bad buy.

01:57:45.835 --> 01:57:47.555
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd just rather save for a house right now.

01:57:47.895 --> 01:57:49.316
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I'm alone in this opinion.

01:57:49.936 --> 01:57:50.896
[SPEAKER_04]: Priorities are important.

01:57:50.956 --> 01:57:51.396
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you that.

01:57:52.317 --> 01:57:56.798
[SPEAKER_04]: Rabababa says, Now that I've played it a few days, the pad is better than expected.

01:57:56.958 --> 01:57:58.258
[SPEAKER_04]: It can do a lot of unique things.

01:57:58.398 --> 01:58:01.159
[SPEAKER_04]: Best of all, I can look up hints on the internet without an extra device.

01:58:01.659 --> 01:58:03.200
[SPEAKER_04]: Very few games take advantage of it.

01:58:04.059 --> 01:58:08.100
[SPEAKER_04]: Flaco Jones says, I got a chance to play it for a few hours and my opinion hasn't changed much.

01:58:08.620 --> 01:58:15.722
[SPEAKER_04]: I still think it's way overpriced when comparing it to the competition and the controller didn't sway me with the small selection of games that utilize it halfway decently.

01:58:16.222 --> 01:58:18.963
[SPEAKER_04]: Better games would definitely be the best way to change my mind.

01:58:19.823 --> 01:58:22.443
[SPEAKER_04]: Sean F replied and said, I was never really excited.

01:58:22.703 --> 01:58:24.424
[SPEAKER_04]: My PS3 and PSP are enough for me.

01:58:25.164 --> 01:58:31.405
[SPEAKER_04]: And Nick M said, yeah, it went from being a polished, well-presented turd to just a turd that sits in the corner of my living room.

01:58:32.146 --> 01:58:32.906
[SPEAKER_04]: So you bought one?

01:58:33.886 --> 01:58:38.468
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be curious to hear more about you bought one and it's sitting in your living room unused.

01:58:38.608 --> 01:58:40.329
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to hear more about that.

01:58:41.109 --> 01:58:42.370
[SPEAKER_04]: Please elaborate for later.

01:58:43.130 --> 01:58:45.111
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to hear about your collection of polished turds.

01:58:45.131 --> 01:58:45.551
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm kidding.

01:58:46.812 --> 01:58:50.814
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't heard of anybody who's bought one that said, yeah, it's already collecting dust in the corner.

01:58:52.595 --> 01:58:55.657
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very curious to explore that further, so please send an email or something.

01:58:55.957 --> 01:59:00.301
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very possible it collected fingerprints, because I'm sure it can collect fingerprints quite well.

01:59:00.481 --> 01:59:02.122
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it does.

01:59:02.142 --> 01:59:02.983
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially the black ones.

01:59:03.263 --> 01:59:05.825
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I read all the comments tonight, because I'm nice.

01:59:06.845 --> 01:59:10.606
[SPEAKER_04]: Code Band is in chat, by the way, to kind of clarify the comment.

01:59:10.666 --> 01:59:17.468
[SPEAKER_04]: I really want to check out Zombie U. And I do agree it's about the games, Rob, but I do think they should get the console under control before a good title can be released.

01:59:17.948 --> 01:59:21.309
[SPEAKER_04]: In light of what Loki said, I get a little more what you're saying now.

01:59:22.050 --> 01:59:22.290
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:59:22.310 --> 01:59:25.671
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple of stories for you guys, and then we're going to get to the match game.

01:59:25.711 --> 01:59:26.131
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

01:59:27.574 --> 01:59:27.874
[SPEAKER_03]: THQ PR Guys

01:59:46.895 --> 01:59:52.317
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been trying to cover up, well, cover up, I guess, defuse a situation that happened on Twitter.

01:59:53.697 --> 01:59:54.537
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was on Twitter.

01:59:55.137 --> 01:59:56.558
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, during an interview.

01:59:56.578 --> 01:59:58.118
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always Twitter.

01:59:58.538 --> 02:00:00.279
[SPEAKER_04]: Take away people's PR, people.

02:00:01.499 --> 02:00:02.919
[SPEAKER_04]: And, like, they say the dumbest shit.

02:00:02.979 --> 02:00:04.300
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why Twitter is great.

02:00:05.160 --> 02:00:05.520
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly.

02:00:06.481 --> 02:00:08.682
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think at least part of it took place on Twitter.

02:00:08.842 --> 02:00:13.705
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically talking about how the Wii U's CPU is slow.

02:00:14.625 --> 02:00:18.647
[SPEAKER_03]: And the quote is actually, the Wii U has a horrible, slow CPU.

02:00:19.167 --> 02:00:29.513
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why they're saying that Metro Last Light is not going to be ported to the Wii U is because the game system has a slow CPU and that it would just be impossible.

02:00:30.633 --> 02:00:30.893
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

02:00:32.478 --> 02:00:45.261
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, THQ doesn't want to have this whole stigma of, oh, yeah, we just totally dogged in that system, but we want to put some games out on it and have Nintendo go, yeah, fuck you guys.

02:00:46.082 --> 02:00:47.262
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going on our system.

02:00:48.262 --> 02:00:53.324
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you think about it, THQ doesn't have a whole ton of... I mean, they have a few games, I guess, that were launched.

02:00:53.344 --> 02:00:56.604
[SPEAKER_03]: There was Darksiders 2 and...

02:00:59.205 --> 02:01:12.721
[SPEAKER_03]: they it's not out yet but they've got Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy that they're porting over to that not necessarily CPU intensive games I mean Darksiders maybe a little bit but you know Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune not quite so much um

02:01:14.222 --> 02:01:29.830
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know, it's interesting though, they have basically the developer saying one thing and then THQ's kind of like saying, oh, well, it's not necessarily what they meant, they're just saying that, oh, it's a very CPU intensive game and, you know, that...

02:01:31.070 --> 02:01:35.833
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, maybe that this, you know, Wii U CPU wouldn't be able to handle this or something.

02:01:36.233 --> 02:01:49.600
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's some other developers saying, well, you know, sounds like, you know, they just couldn't even bother, you know, trying to port the game system, you know, port over because it does have a faster GPU and a lot more RAM than the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360.

02:01:50.801 --> 02:01:54.643
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, you know, it's this Gustav Holling thing.

02:01:55.043 --> 02:01:57.545
[SPEAKER_03]: saying, oh, yeah, you know, GPU and RAM's nice.

02:01:57.605 --> 02:02:00.466
[SPEAKER_03]: I have shaders and textures loaded, but physics and gameplay run CPU.

02:02:00.486 --> 02:02:01.507
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I don't know.

02:02:02.127 --> 02:02:03.168
[SPEAKER_03]: Will that be a problem?

02:02:03.829 --> 02:02:04.429
[SPEAKER_03]: Possibly.

02:02:04.709 --> 02:02:05.029
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

02:02:05.069 --> 02:02:15.636
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be interesting to see if we get, you know, if Grand Theft Auto V doesn't come to the Wii U because it's got a slow CPU and can't load, you know, can't load the world fast enough or something like that.

02:02:16.451 --> 02:02:23.895
[SPEAKER_04]: TigerClaw with a fair thought in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Maybe the Wii U having a better GPU and a slow CPU is a trade-off.

02:02:24.275 --> 02:02:33.820
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo wanted a system with really great graphics, but had to sacrifice CPU in order to bring the cost of the system down, which is why some games like Arkham City have frame rate drops.

02:02:34.941 --> 02:02:36.401
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not good.

02:02:36.782 --> 02:02:41.024
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I understand that if you're going to make sacrifices, then you're not ready.

02:02:41.324 --> 02:02:45.186
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you need to wait until that tech comes down in price.

02:02:45.966 --> 02:02:47.887
[SPEAKER_03]: and maybe one of the consoles will be more finished.

02:02:48.367 --> 02:02:56.049
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's going to be a problem because if you're not willing to put the technology into it, you're going to have these next-gen systems come out and they're just going to run circles around you.

02:02:56.449 --> 02:03:02.911
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and the frame rate drop in Arkham City, I'm chalking that up to the fact that it's a port of a game that wasn't designed for the console.

02:03:03.351 --> 02:03:05.992
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really curious what 2013's games are going to look like.

02:03:06.052 --> 02:03:08.233
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really what's going to define the Wii U, honestly.

02:03:08.433 --> 02:03:10.114
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure the first party games will look nice.

02:03:10.154 --> 02:03:12.055
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they've always kind of based their sales off of.

02:03:12.075 --> 02:03:13.396
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what always happens for Nintendo.

02:03:13.636 --> 02:03:24.063
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, that'll look nice because they're developing for the system, but you're going to have to wonder with some of these game systems that are already out there now, and you're going to have a Wii U version coming out at the same time.

02:03:24.663 --> 02:03:33.969
[SPEAKER_03]: and honestly, for me, it seems like it's like, okay, Nintendo told these publishers, hey, by the way, you gotta have this gimmick that's thrown in there.

02:03:34.009 --> 02:03:42.894
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, for example, NBA 2K13, you can hold up the Wii U's gamepad to see which of your athletes or whatever are tired.

02:03:44.395 --> 02:03:45.035
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

02:04:03.766 --> 02:04:04.887
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:04:27.848 --> 02:04:28.589
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:04:50.628 --> 02:05:17.151
[SPEAKER_04]: going to our chat room with some comments at live.vognetwork.com Ranma says I'm waiting for Mario Kart and Bayonetta 2 and Dungeon Buster says I'm mostly waiting on Bayonetta 2 Ranma says by the way I feel bad for people eBaying Wii U's it's pointless don't feel bad for them point and laugh at them I think it's hilarious that that whole scheme is backfiring because those people that are buying consoles just to flip them and take them away from somebody who might really want them fuck them I hope they lose a lot of money

02:05:18.672 --> 02:05:46.829
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope they get stuck with all those Twinkies too and have to eat them so you know what I feel no sympathy for them unless it was like legitimately bought and maybe being flipped around because a person decided well I don't want this polished turd sitting in the corner of my room anymore that's different like a used Wii U already or whatever but like somebody who bought it just to try and flip it for an increased cost middle finger to you I don't care that you're out $400 they'll take them back to the store and get their money back which is also bullshit but you know it is what it is

02:05:47.972 --> 02:06:15.579
[SPEAKER_04]: anyhow uh piggybacking on this a little bit there's a piece in the New York Times that is kind of a like it's in the New York Times it's not really an opinion article but it certainly kind of kind of looks at is did Nintendo do the right thing is the Wii U a good system and they go to a familiar name for a quote which you know this little quote from the New York Times article is making its way around the game blogs and the quote is from Nolan Bushnell you recognize that name yep yeah what did he do Jamie

02:06:17.026 --> 02:06:18.128
[SPEAKER_09]: and Chuck E. Cheese.

02:06:18.688 --> 02:06:20.490
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and Pond too.

02:06:20.691 --> 02:06:21.391
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, and Chuck E. Cheese.

02:06:21.411 --> 02:06:22.092
[SPEAKER_04]: That's important too.

02:06:22.613 --> 02:06:27.539
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, quote, I actually am baffled by it.

02:06:28.300 --> 02:06:29.962
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's going to be a big success.

02:06:31.857 --> 02:06:32.478
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the quote.

02:06:32.898 --> 02:06:33.218
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

02:06:33.819 --> 02:06:34.680
[SPEAKER_04]: What else did he say here?

02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:40.306
[SPEAKER_04]: Quote, these things will continue to sputter along, but I really don't think they'll be of major import ever again.

02:06:40.767 --> 02:06:42.689
[SPEAKER_04]: It feels like the end of an era to me.

02:06:42.709 --> 02:06:48.214
[SPEAKER_04]: And, of course, that has all the game blogs going, Nolan Bushnell thinks the Wii U is the end of an era, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

02:06:49.315 --> 02:07:14.232
[SPEAKER_04]: and the the it's important to note that this article also kind of takes the stance of uh that mobile it's it's another one of those pieces that say mobile gaming is going to kill it all and and you know Nintendo's just trying to get into tablet gaming with this and so I don't know how I feel about all this but it is interesting that Nolan Bushnell kind of throws his two cents out there granted it's one small quote out of what I hope was a larger interview but um

02:07:15.072 --> 02:07:16.573
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it the end of an era?

02:07:17.074 --> 02:07:20.856
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the Wii U the swan song of console gaming as we know it?

02:07:21.497 --> 02:07:22.417
[SPEAKER_04]: I hardly think so.

02:07:24.038 --> 02:07:25.239
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just stupid.

02:07:26.140 --> 02:07:33.885
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, you're kind of assuming that everyone's going to buy into it or not going to buy into it and go, Oh no, what am I going to game on now?

02:07:34.306 --> 02:07:39.229
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't understand why everyone thinks if these next-gen consoles fail that the whole industry is going to fail.

02:07:39.529 --> 02:07:41.451
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, you have some consoles that still work.

02:07:41.471 --> 02:07:43.152
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what happens if a console fails?

02:07:43.692 --> 02:07:43.993
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what?

02:07:44.013 --> 02:07:45.755
[SPEAKER_03]: They just make games for other consoles.

02:07:46.075 --> 02:07:46.716
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like the Vita.

02:07:46.917 --> 02:07:48.519
[SPEAKER_03]: If the Vita fails, guess what?

02:07:48.539 --> 02:07:50.642
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll just make games for the 3DS and the DS.

02:07:51.628 --> 02:07:59.633
[SPEAKER_04]: Black Wolf kind of puts Nolan's words in another light here, saying, no more TV gaming, all going handheld mobile now.

02:07:59.753 --> 02:08:00.993
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what Nolan thinks.

02:08:01.414 --> 02:08:04.395
[SPEAKER_04]: More people play mobile games than ever played console games.

02:08:04.755 --> 02:08:13.200
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe he's thinking, maybe Nolan is going this way because of the Wii U invoking the tablet thing, kind of trying to get that piece of mobile game.

02:08:13.240 --> 02:08:14.081
[SPEAKER_04]: But for me, like...

02:08:15.061 --> 02:08:22.108
[SPEAKER_04]: The part that people miss when they jump to that conclusion is that they're not putting I mean, the Wii U kind of can't do those same tablet games.

02:08:22.228 --> 02:08:26.032
[SPEAKER_04]: It really is a second screen that does have limited touch controls.

02:08:26.132 --> 02:08:27.613
[SPEAKER_10]: It just means you can play while you pee.

02:08:29.775 --> 02:08:31.797
[SPEAKER_04]: I guarantee there's going to be DS Virtual Console games by next year.

02:08:59.745 --> 02:09:23.228
[SPEAKER_04]: oh oh with the whole yeah because since there is second screen anyway and why not screen is set up exactly like a ds why not i think clearly it all indicates a return to animatronic restaurants uh blackwell following up saying well what he's saying is that the new console isn't selling out so people have stopped buying new game consoles i think it is actually selling now it's just they're replenishing a lot faster

02:09:23.328 --> 02:09:46.516
[SPEAKER_04]: and Nintendo's also not advertising it because maybe you know and there's a lot of theories behind that but you know maybe to their benefit they know they're going to be limited so why I mean the people that want to buy them already know about it so why have that advertising push behind it let that grow a little more organically and then do the big advertising push in January February when when you need it spend your gift card on a Wii U you know that that stuff

02:09:50.215 --> 02:09:54.037
[SPEAKER_04]: BlackWolf continuing on trying to push the points here.

02:09:54.718 --> 02:09:59.261
[SPEAKER_04]: But Cut the Rope and Angry Birds are the games that majority of game buyers want to play.

02:09:59.661 --> 02:10:00.862
[SPEAKER_04]: We're the minority now.

02:10:03.864 --> 02:10:12.651
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes and no to me because I feel like the majority audience that's buying Cut the Rope and Angry Birds is an audience that didn't exist before.

02:10:13.531 --> 02:10:18.035
[SPEAKER_04]: Did people really switch from console gaming to exclusive mobile gaming?

02:10:19.110 --> 02:10:20.933
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really think that's what happened

02:10:35.976 --> 02:10:47.805
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I can understand that, okay, that's where a lot of money is at and so forth, but the console industry has been afloat for the years since 1978 with, say, the video game crash of 83, 84.

02:10:49.046 --> 02:10:51.208
[SPEAKER_04]: The video game industry has been afloat without that audience.

02:10:52.825 --> 02:10:53.806
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know.

02:10:54.587 --> 02:10:54.847
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

02:10:55.588 --> 02:10:55.849
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:10:56.569 --> 02:10:57.150
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move on.

02:10:59.253 --> 02:11:02.717
[SPEAKER_04]: Bojikawa wants to say, I keep hearing that the Wii U hasn't been advertised.

02:11:03.037 --> 02:11:05.159
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't watch TV, but I do watch Hulu.

02:11:05.480 --> 02:11:08.583
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen the commercial for the Wii U many times there the last couple weeks.

02:11:09.444 --> 02:11:12.707
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also your audience that's most likely to be aware of things like that.

02:11:12.967 --> 02:11:15.108
[SPEAKER_04]: That's still targeting your tech crowd.

02:11:15.749 --> 02:11:19.852
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a big difference between running Wii U commercials there and running Wii U commercials on Saturday morning cartoons.

02:11:20.432 --> 02:11:21.713
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, I digress.

02:11:22.534 --> 02:11:23.815
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's play some Match Game.

02:11:24.035 --> 02:11:25.096
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to do Match Game.

02:11:26.317 --> 02:11:28.198
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't done Match Game in forever on this show.

02:11:31.540 --> 02:11:31.821
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:11:32.401 --> 02:11:36.044
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to play Match Game in our chat room...

02:11:36.949 --> 02:11:37.690
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:12:03.228 --> 02:12:03.708
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

02:12:04.809 --> 02:12:07.389
[SPEAKER_04]: Also joining us for the Match Game tonight is Tech Master Loki.

02:12:07.910 --> 02:12:08.230
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

02:12:09.070 --> 02:12:11.291
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to be joining you for the Match Game tonight.

02:12:11.331 --> 02:12:11.971
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo-hoo.

02:12:12.731 --> 02:12:17.753
[SPEAKER_04]: Also joining us for the Match Game tonight, say hello to, it's your first time on the show, be gentle, Rachel.

02:12:18.053 --> 02:12:18.453
[SPEAKER_04]: Howdy.

02:12:18.693 --> 02:12:19.173
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

02:12:20.134 --> 02:12:21.694
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you here to promote anything tonight?

02:12:21.734 --> 02:12:23.835
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a new movie coming out that you need to promote?

02:12:24.715 --> 02:12:25.235
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a book?

02:12:25.836 --> 02:12:26.516
[SPEAKER_04]: Quick blog plug.

02:12:27.196 --> 02:12:27.676
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sure.

02:12:28.536 --> 02:12:30.457
[SPEAKER_12]: Greetings at the Wasteland at WordPress.

02:12:31.017 --> 02:12:31.577
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

02:12:31.737 --> 02:12:32.897
[SPEAKER_12]: Greetings from the Wasteland.

02:12:33.177 --> 02:12:33.717
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

02:12:34.197 --> 02:12:35.237
[SPEAKER_04]: But it doesn't stop there.

02:12:35.277 --> 02:12:39.198
[SPEAKER_04]: We have one more person playing match game with us tonight.

02:12:39.538 --> 02:12:41.278
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello, everybody, to Alan.

02:12:41.739 --> 02:12:43.119
[SPEAKER_05]: Raspberries.

02:12:44.359 --> 02:12:45.159
[SPEAKER_04]: How are you doing, Alan?

02:12:45.959 --> 02:12:46.259
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.

02:12:46.679 --> 02:12:50.180
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything... Are you doing your Carol Channing for us tonight?

02:12:50.240 --> 02:12:52.760
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what you're going to do match game as?

02:12:52.940 --> 02:12:54.381
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm fine.

02:12:54.441 --> 02:12:55.781
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have anything you want to promote tonight?

02:12:58.530 --> 02:13:00.051
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to promote Fabulous Flame?

02:13:00.451 --> 02:13:01.592
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm really sorry about that.

02:13:02.813 --> 02:13:04.874
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to promote new internet.

02:13:05.495 --> 02:13:06.736
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not dropping out.

02:13:07.396 --> 02:13:08.537
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, apparently it's doing pretty well.

02:13:08.877 --> 02:13:10.038
[SPEAKER_04]: So, hooray to that.

02:13:10.418 --> 02:13:12.540
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we're going to open up the Skype line.

02:13:12.920 --> 02:13:15.942
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember, we're going to have one contestant in the chat room, one on the Skype line.

02:13:16.302 --> 02:13:19.424
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want to play a match game, call us on the Skype line right now.

02:13:19.584 --> 02:13:21.706
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.

02:13:22.346 --> 02:13:24.628
[SPEAKER_04]: or 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:13:24.668 --> 02:13:27.370
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to pick one person on the phones and another from our chat room.

02:13:28.190 --> 02:13:30.352
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like we have a few correct answers right now.

02:13:30.872 --> 02:13:32.433
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:13:32.473 --> 02:13:35.195
[SPEAKER_04]: Use name in Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:13:35.616 --> 02:13:41.940
[SPEAKER_04]: While we wait for that call, because there is a little bit of a delay still, and I think the delay got longer because of our setup, but that's okay.

02:13:41.980 --> 02:13:44.502
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather it be a longer delay and not drop out as much.

02:13:46.503 --> 02:13:49.806
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyhow, what I want to... Oh, we got a call coming in.

02:13:49.966 --> 02:13:50.126
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's...

02:13:51.437 --> 02:13:51.837
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

02:13:53.337 --> 02:13:54.318
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

02:13:54.338 --> 02:13:54.718
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

02:13:55.698 --> 02:13:57.178
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, this is SSJ100 Matt.

02:13:57.218 --> 02:13:58.458
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, SSJ100 Matt.

02:13:58.478 --> 02:13:59.078
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

02:13:59.198 --> 02:13:59.758
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

02:13:59.938 --> 02:14:00.579
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good.

02:14:00.719 --> 02:14:02.339
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I haven't heard from you in a while.

02:14:02.719 --> 02:14:04.159
[SPEAKER_04]: You did all right through Sandy and all that?

02:14:05.319 --> 02:14:05.959
[SPEAKER_07]: I did, actually.

02:14:06.160 --> 02:14:06.620
[SPEAKER_04]: Good, good.

02:14:06.660 --> 02:14:07.280
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad to hear it.

02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:09.360
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, are you ready to play some match game with us tonight?

02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:10.740
[SPEAKER_04]: Hells yeah.

02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:11.880
[SPEAKER_04]: Hells yeah.

02:14:12.261 --> 02:14:12.501
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:14:12.541 --> 02:14:16.021
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like we have only four people in chat that want to play along.

02:14:16.101 --> 02:14:17.541
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's see.

02:14:18.162 --> 02:14:20.602
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan, since you can't see chat, pick a number between one and four.

02:14:21.903 --> 02:14:22.764
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft

02:14:38.524 --> 02:14:39.264
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft vs. SSJ100Map

02:14:55.703 --> 02:14:56.423
[SPEAKER_04]: You get a point.

02:14:56.723 --> 02:14:59.204
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep in mind, Actdeft is playing against you in the chat room.

02:14:59.444 --> 02:15:03.666
[SPEAKER_04]: He'll be sending his answers over private message and you will be giving yours over the phone.

02:15:03.706 --> 02:15:09.228
[SPEAKER_04]: But remember, please do not give your answers until we have a ding from everybody here in the studio.

02:15:09.868 --> 02:15:11.329
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, do you understand the rules, SSJ100 Matt?

02:15:12.649 --> 02:15:12.949
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.

02:15:13.109 --> 02:15:14.511
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's because you've played before.

02:15:14.871 --> 02:15:15.651
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, yes Alan.

02:15:16.072 --> 02:15:22.356
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to add that we're all really bad at this because I remember the last time we played this and not a single one of us matched shit with anyone.

02:15:23.137 --> 02:15:24.238
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the joke.

02:15:26.059 --> 02:15:26.860
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's not.

02:15:27.941 --> 02:15:28.661
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here we go.

02:15:30.002 --> 02:15:33.145
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into tonight's first question.

02:15:33.705 --> 02:15:34.846
[SPEAKER_04]: Drumroll please.

02:15:34.986 --> 02:15:35.466
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

02:15:35.546 --> 02:15:36.367
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight's first question.

02:15:36.407 --> 02:15:37.448
[SPEAKER_04]: Four questions tonight.

02:15:39.361 --> 02:15:47.088
[SPEAKER_04]: As Space Harrier's biggest fan, Jamie is very excited about Space Harrier coming to the 3DS.

02:15:48.189 --> 02:16:01.502
[SPEAKER_04]: She found it odd, though, that in her honor, the designers changed the opening line from Welcome to the Fantasy Zone, get ready, to Welcome to the blank, get ready.

02:16:08.977 --> 02:16:13.180
[SPEAKER_04]: Space Harrier's biggest fan, Jamie, is very excited about Space Harrier coming to the 3DS.

02:16:13.520 --> 02:16:24.508
[SPEAKER_04]: She found it odd, though, that in her honor, the designers changed the opening line from Welcome to the Fantasy Zone, get ready, to Welcome to the... What the fuck was that?

02:16:24.588 --> 02:16:27.210
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the blank, get ready.

02:16:27.450 --> 02:16:28.931
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, you've been beeped.

02:16:30.192 --> 02:16:34.435
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently I got censored by this crappy Think Music MP3, so we'll pause that.

02:16:34.856 --> 02:16:37.318
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so I'm going to say...

02:16:39.022 --> 02:16:39.263
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding.

02:16:39.403 --> 02:16:39.744
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding.

02:16:39.804 --> 02:16:40.145
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding.

02:16:40.325 --> 02:16:41.187
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding, Alan.

02:16:41.227 --> 02:16:41.448
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding.

02:16:42.169 --> 02:16:42.510
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding.

02:16:42.610 --> 02:16:43.673
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so we have five.

02:16:44.014 --> 02:16:45.517
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I see the answer in chat.

02:16:46.139 --> 02:16:48.083
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100Matt, do you have an answer?

02:16:48.123 --> 02:16:48.584
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.

02:16:48.605 --> 02:16:49.146
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the...

02:16:50.814 --> 02:16:51.735
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to the Citadel

02:17:17.344 --> 02:17:21.333
[SPEAKER_04]: somebody put that down as the quote of the night because I'm fucking clever Rachel

02:17:22.423 --> 02:17:23.484
[SPEAKER_04]: Frenzy from school.

02:17:23.684 --> 02:17:24.725
[SPEAKER_04]: How well do we know Jamie?

02:17:24.825 --> 02:17:25.665
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the?

02:17:26.266 --> 02:17:29.908
[SPEAKER_04]: Wii U. Welcome to the Wii U. Get ready.

02:17:30.128 --> 02:17:32.310
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, what was Actdeft's?

02:17:32.670 --> 02:17:33.550
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm so sorry.

02:17:33.691 --> 02:17:35.192
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, I'm not ignoring Actdeft.

02:17:35.572 --> 02:17:38.214
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft said Garrus Zone.

02:17:38.634 --> 02:17:39.474
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a little rusty.

02:17:39.494 --> 02:17:40.235
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm out of practice.

02:17:40.255 --> 02:17:41.216
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't played this in over a year.

02:17:41.576 --> 02:17:43.397
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the Garrus Zone.

02:17:43.637 --> 02:17:44.118
[SPEAKER_04]: Get ready.

02:17:44.178 --> 02:17:46.479
[SPEAKER_04]: So two Mass Effect answers, but a little different there.

02:17:47.360 --> 02:17:49.161
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have Welcome to the Citadel and Welcome to the Garrus Zone.

02:17:49.441 --> 02:17:51.082
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Loki, welcome to the?

02:17:51.402 --> 02:17:52.143
[SPEAKER_04]: I have Citadel.

02:17:52.583 --> 02:17:53.364
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you really?

02:17:53.524 --> 02:17:53.925
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.

02:17:54.085 --> 02:17:55.887
[SPEAKER_04]: A point for SSJ100Match.

02:17:56.107 --> 02:17:56.988
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that, Alan.

02:17:57.329 --> 02:17:58.250
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that, a point.

02:17:59.371 --> 02:17:59.771
[SPEAKER_03]: I have it.

02:17:59.811 --> 02:18:01.373
[SPEAKER_03]: It's typed on my screen and everything.

02:18:01.553 --> 02:18:02.374
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, there it is.

02:18:03.295 --> 02:18:03.636
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:18:04.477 --> 02:18:09.703
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of Alan, who says that these things always end in a 0-0 tie, welcome to the...

02:18:10.302 --> 02:18:11.002
[SPEAKER_05]: Pinkberry.

02:18:11.022 --> 02:18:12.703
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome to the Pinkberry.

02:18:12.763 --> 02:18:13.663
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a good answer.

02:18:13.683 --> 02:18:14.663
[SPEAKER_05]: I should have said Pinkberry.

02:18:15.424 --> 02:18:16.284
[SPEAKER_04]: That is a good answer.

02:18:16.324 --> 02:18:17.224
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the Pinkberry.

02:18:17.284 --> 02:18:17.644
[SPEAKER_04]: Get ready.

02:18:18.084 --> 02:18:22.466
[SPEAKER_04]: And my answer was welcome to the Normandy.

02:18:22.866 --> 02:18:23.426
[SPEAKER_04]: Get ready.

02:18:23.566 --> 02:18:24.927
[SPEAKER_04]: So close.

02:18:24.987 --> 02:18:25.467
[SPEAKER_11]: So close.

02:18:25.527 --> 02:18:26.407
[SPEAKER_04]: So close.

02:18:26.447 --> 02:18:27.047
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what?

02:18:27.107 --> 02:18:29.288
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not taking pity because you already got a point.

02:18:29.768 --> 02:18:30.228
[SPEAKER_04]: So there it is.

02:18:30.448 --> 02:18:32.949
[SPEAKER_04]: The score all in the lead there.

02:18:33.069 --> 02:18:34.550
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100MAT has one point.

02:18:35.110 --> 02:18:36.790
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft has zero.

02:18:37.791 --> 02:18:38.071
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:18:38.131 --> 02:18:38.471
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

02:18:39.773 --> 02:18:40.714
[SPEAKER_04]: On to the next question.

02:18:41.714 --> 02:18:42.575
[SPEAKER_04]: Question number two.

02:18:42.615 --> 02:18:44.636
[SPEAKER_04]: You feeling good about that lead, SSJ100Matt?

02:18:45.337 --> 02:18:46.698
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm feeling great.

02:18:46.878 --> 02:18:47.618
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, feeling great.

02:18:47.658 --> 02:18:49.359
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go to question number two.

02:18:50.941 --> 02:19:05.030
[SPEAKER_04]: THQ might have said that the Wii U has a horrible slow CPU, but Loki is on record saying that the Wii U has a horrible slow blank CPU.

02:19:08.615 --> 02:19:18.461
[SPEAKER_04]: THQ might have said that the Wii U has a horrible slow CPU, but Loki is on record saying that the Wii U has a horrible slow blank.

02:19:18.481 --> 02:19:22.924
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I can make this small enough.

02:19:31.775 --> 02:19:35.598
[SPEAKER_04]: has a horrible slow... I'll do it live!

02:19:37.079 --> 02:19:39.280
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you have to write the answer down.

02:19:39.681 --> 02:19:45.005
[SPEAKER_04]: Or else Alan's going to come over there and say, he rigged it, he rigged it.

02:19:46.826 --> 02:19:48.467
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan is the Mass Effect po-po, you know.

02:19:49.068 --> 02:19:49.368
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

02:19:50.068 --> 02:19:50.409
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, Alan?

02:19:52.289 --> 02:19:52.589
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:19:53.270 --> 02:19:53.770
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here we go.

02:19:53.790 --> 02:19:54.850
[SPEAKER_11]: Does that mean he's C-Sec?

02:19:55.130 --> 02:19:55.750
[SPEAKER_04]: We have an answer.

02:19:56.230 --> 02:19:56.490
[SPEAKER_04]: Shut up.

02:19:56.770 --> 02:19:58.091
[SPEAKER_04]: We have an answer from Actdeft.

02:19:58.511 --> 02:20:00.091
[SPEAKER_04]: So that means we are ready to go.

02:20:00.291 --> 02:20:02.172
[SPEAKER_04]: SJ100 Matt, you have that answer in your mind?

02:20:02.312 --> 02:20:02.912
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, I do.

02:20:02.992 --> 02:20:03.632
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, here we go.

02:20:04.112 --> 02:20:10.494
[SPEAKER_04]: THQ might have said that the Wii U has a horrible slow CPU, but Loki is on record saying that the Wii U has a horrible slow...

02:20:12.122 --> 02:20:14.104
[SPEAKER_07]: Rendering of tits slash boobs.

02:20:14.384 --> 02:20:15.786
[SPEAKER_04]: Rendering of boobs.

02:20:16.106 --> 02:20:16.467
[SPEAKER_04]: Tits.

02:20:16.887 --> 02:20:17.367
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, good.

02:20:18.088 --> 02:20:23.374
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft says a horrible, slow maker or company.

02:20:24.174 --> 02:20:25.676
[SPEAKER_04]: He's saying Nintendo is slow.

02:20:25.816 --> 02:20:26.076
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it?

02:20:26.537 --> 02:20:26.877
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.

02:20:26.917 --> 02:20:27.258
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it.

02:20:27.478 --> 02:20:27.778
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

02:20:27.818 --> 02:20:28.619
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see how that pays off.

02:20:29.240 --> 02:20:29.540
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:20:29.960 --> 02:20:32.903
[SPEAKER_04]: Has a horrible, slow DarkSakura.

02:20:33.464 --> 02:20:34.005
[SPEAKER_04]: Boob jiggle.

02:20:34.775 --> 02:20:35.736
[SPEAKER_04]: Boob Jiggle!

02:20:36.376 --> 02:20:38.238
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, that's really close.

02:20:38.538 --> 02:20:39.359
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd say half a point.

02:20:39.599 --> 02:20:40.139
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really close.

02:20:40.159 --> 02:20:42.981
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wouldn't even say that a slow Boob Jiggle would be a bad thing.

02:20:43.021 --> 02:20:48.005
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because, you know... Alan is the unofficial... I almost said Mass Effect judge.

02:20:48.345 --> 02:20:52.669
[SPEAKER_04]: As the unofficial match game judge, do you think Boob Jiggle is a match with Boob Rendering?

02:20:53.389 --> 02:20:54.070
[SPEAKER_04]: I will allow it.

02:20:54.530 --> 02:20:55.351
[SPEAKER_04]: I will allow it!

02:20:55.931 --> 02:20:58.013
[SPEAKER_04]: Two points for SSJ100 Matt.

02:20:58.733 --> 02:20:59.594
[SPEAKER_04]: No points for Actdeft.

02:20:59.734 --> 02:21:00.354
[SPEAKER_04]: It's okay, Actdeft.

02:21:00.394 --> 02:21:00.715
[SPEAKER_04]: It's okay.

02:21:01.714 --> 02:21:04.395
[SPEAKER_04]: Rachel, a horrible, slow... Booty.

02:21:05.095 --> 02:21:05.715
[SPEAKER_04]: Booty!

02:21:07.476 --> 02:21:09.477
[SPEAKER_04]: Booty and boobies are very different.

02:21:09.577 --> 02:21:11.377
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people are tits, some people are ass.

02:21:11.437 --> 02:21:13.538
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are two different answers for sure.

02:21:13.598 --> 02:21:15.038
[SPEAKER_04]: If we gave them one, we're not going to give them both.

02:21:15.419 --> 02:21:15.699
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:21:16.639 --> 02:21:22.041

02:22:11.170 --> 02:22:17.536
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob was shocked to hear that the R4 cartridges were being banned everywhere.

02:22:18.697 --> 02:22:27.286
[SPEAKER_04]: Upon hearing of the latest ban, Rob shouted at Alan, quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of blanks.

02:22:31.307 --> 02:22:38.254
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob shouted at Alan, Quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of blank.

02:22:38.915 --> 02:22:41.237

[SPEAKER_04]: It's all right, Rachel.

02:22:59.753 --> 02:23:00.973
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we just met earlier tonight.

02:23:01.013 --> 02:23:03.154
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be hard to think of a way to razz me.

02:23:03.915 --> 02:23:04.715
[SPEAKER_04]: She's looking around.

02:23:04.955 --> 02:23:06.376
[SPEAKER_04]: What the hell is this guy like?

02:23:06.576 --> 02:23:07.677
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of stashes here.

02:23:07.697 --> 02:23:09.978
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just trying to, you know.

02:23:10.178 --> 02:23:10.618
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all right.

02:23:11.038 --> 02:23:12.099
[SPEAKER_04]: You can make something up.

02:23:12.139 --> 02:23:12.759
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll never know.

02:23:12.959 --> 02:23:13.159
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:23:13.179 --> 02:23:13.680

[SPEAKER_04]: And I see a ding from Actdeft.

02:23:20.899 --> 02:23:21.179
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I got one.

02:23:21.199 --> 02:23:22.041
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go with a classic match game.

02:23:38.115 --> 02:23:41.137
[SPEAKER_07]: Answer with Non-Cylon Occupied Caprica.

02:23:41.397 --> 02:23:43.999
[SPEAKER_04]: Non-Cylon Occupied Caprica.

02:23:44.280 --> 02:23:46.921
[SPEAKER_04]: My stash of Non-Cylon Occupied Caprica.

02:23:47.322 --> 02:23:52.586
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how well that's going to go over with somebody who is brand new to the show tonight, but we'll see what happens.

02:23:53.226 --> 02:23:56.808
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft says, dating sims and hentai games.

02:23:57.129 --> 02:24:03.373
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to understand there are so many people that are like, what is non-Sylon, Apricide, Caprica, even me?

02:24:03.433 --> 02:24:04.553
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't even say it right anymore.

02:24:04.713 --> 02:24:05.714
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an old ass joke.

02:24:05.754 --> 02:24:07.035
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a really funny joke.

02:24:07.115 --> 02:24:10.477
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it would have been just about as funny as if he said a mustache of big black cocks.

02:24:11.017 --> 02:24:12.418
[SPEAKER_04]: But he didn't.

02:24:12.558 --> 02:24:12.859
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:24:12.999 --> 02:24:13.339
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyhow.

02:24:14.440 --> 02:24:14.700
[SPEAKER_07]: Quick.

02:24:14.720 --> 02:24:15.160
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

02:24:17.179 --> 02:24:18.220
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I change my answer to that?

02:24:18.240 --> 02:24:18.700
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you cannot.

02:24:18.760 --> 02:24:19.560
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here we go.

02:24:19.961 --> 02:24:20.361
[SPEAKER_04]: Quick.

[SPEAKER_11]: Big black cocks.

02:24:26.584 --> 02:24:27.865
[SPEAKER_04]: Big black cocks.

02:24:29.186 --> 02:24:31.067
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, and I didn't let him change the answer.

02:24:31.987 --> 02:24:32.447
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

02:24:32.928 --> 02:24:33.288
[SPEAKER_04]: Quick.

02:24:33.768 --> 02:24:35.609
[SPEAKER_04]: Hide the... Did I really read your mind?

02:24:37.650 --> 02:24:38.331
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, quick.

02:24:38.731 --> 02:24:39.552
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you expect?

02:24:39.572 --> 02:24:43.075
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone was talking about, you know, drawings of vaginas earlier.

02:24:43.175 --> 02:24:44.376
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true, that's true.

02:24:44.416 --> 02:24:50.522
[SPEAKER_04]: She's got porn on the... It sounds like Actdeft's answer of Dating Sims and Hentai Games almost was a match there.

02:24:51.102 --> 02:24:52.203
[SPEAKER_04]: Dating Sims and Hentai Games.

02:24:52.523 --> 02:24:57.187
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Rachel, my stash of... Twilight Books.

02:24:57.628 --> 02:24:58.689
[SPEAKER_04]: Twilight Books?

02:24:58.849 --> 02:24:59.329
[SPEAKER_04]: Get out!

02:25:02.952 --> 02:25:04.033
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't own Twilight Books.

02:25:04.113 --> 02:25:04.814
[SPEAKER_04]: You made that up.

02:25:05.248 --> 02:25:06.910
[SPEAKER_12]: I could have said Fifty Shades of Grey.

02:25:06.970 --> 02:25:07.671
[SPEAKER_12]: Look on the bright side.

02:25:08.172 --> 02:25:08.632
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

02:25:08.692 --> 02:25:08.912
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:25:08.932 --> 02:25:09.413
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you that.

02:25:09.553 --> 02:25:11.856
[SPEAKER_10]: Does Rob look like a 14-year-old Mormon girl?

02:25:12.817 --> 02:25:16.642
[SPEAKER_04]: Well... If only we were a TV show.

02:25:16.922 --> 02:25:17.262
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:25:17.643 --> 02:25:18.444
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, quick.

02:25:18.544 --> 02:25:21.748
[SPEAKER_04]: Hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of... Cat pictures.

02:25:22.248 --> 02:25:23.650
[SPEAKER_04]: Cat pictures.

02:25:23.830 --> 02:25:24.831
[SPEAKER_04]: Good answer.

02:25:24.951 --> 02:25:25.332
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a match.

02:25:26.750 --> 02:25:33.157
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan, quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of... New, still-in-box President Cat merchandise.

02:25:33.977 --> 02:25:37.121
[SPEAKER_04]: New, still-in-box President Cat merchandise.

02:25:37.421 --> 02:25:37.981
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a match.

02:25:38.902 --> 02:25:40.884
[SPEAKER_04]: And my answer, the most important one, clearly.

02:25:41.625 --> 02:25:46.770
[SPEAKER_04]: Quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of... Disney pins?

02:25:48.396 --> 02:25:49.418
[SPEAKER_11]: That's very accurate.

02:25:49.498 --> 02:25:49.839
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

02:25:50.240 --> 02:25:52.024
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry I played it straight on that one.

02:25:53.507 --> 02:25:54.389
[SPEAKER_04]: Womp womp.

02:25:55.130 --> 02:25:56.072
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, it is still 2-0.

02:25:58.342 --> 02:25:58.642
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

02:25:58.742 --> 02:25:59.563
[SPEAKER_04]: Shane is in chat.

02:25:59.583 --> 02:26:03.606
[SPEAKER_04]: Shane Alinko in chat says, I own the Twilight books and I'm not a 14-year-old Mormon girl.

02:26:03.766 --> 02:26:04.227
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, you are.

02:26:04.987 --> 02:26:07.269
[SPEAKER_12]: You make me very sad, person on chat.

02:26:07.809 --> 02:26:10.171
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft says, fuck, I was going to say President Cat.

02:26:10.271 --> 02:26:11.292
[SPEAKER_04]: Woulda, coulda, shoulda.

02:26:12.393 --> 02:26:14.715
[SPEAKER_04]: Dating Sims is a pretty good answer, though, even though I don't own any.

02:26:15.295 --> 02:26:15.596
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:26:16.036 --> 02:26:17.017
[SPEAKER_09]: I have Dating Sims.

02:26:17.577 --> 02:26:18.117
[SPEAKER_09]: They're yowie.

02:26:18.438 --> 02:26:21.600
[SPEAKER_04]: Here is your chance to close the gap, Actdeft.

02:26:21.800 --> 02:26:23.302
[SPEAKER_04]: You feeling pretty good about this, SSJ100Map?

02:26:24.512 --> 02:26:25.273
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm feeling golden.

02:26:25.333 --> 02:26:26.193
[SPEAKER_04]: You're feeling golden.

02:26:26.213 --> 02:26:26.654
[SPEAKER_04]: Here you go.

02:26:26.994 --> 02:26:28.415
[SPEAKER_04]: One more question.

02:26:28.475 --> 02:26:29.036
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

02:26:29.496 --> 02:26:30.177
[SPEAKER_04]: Last question.

02:26:31.918 --> 02:26:38.723
[SPEAKER_04]: Peter Molyneux recently advertised Goddess on the Cube in Curiosity.

02:26:39.784 --> 02:26:47.630
[SPEAKER_04]: It turns out that what Peter put inside the Cube is actually just an ad for blank.

02:26:49.738 --> 02:26:51.640
[SPEAKER_04]: Y'all know Curiosity, What's in the Cube?

02:26:52.160 --> 02:26:59.966
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Goddess was advertised on the Cube, and it turns out what Peter put in the Cube is actually just an ad for blank.

02:27:03.049 --> 02:27:06.472
[SPEAKER_04]: What is in the Cube is actually just an ad for blank.

02:27:06.932 --> 02:27:08.293
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding in a major way.

02:27:08.654 --> 02:27:09.074
[SPEAKER_12]: Ding.

02:27:09.835 --> 02:27:10.155
Ding.

02:27:13.666 --> 02:27:13.966
[SPEAKER_04]: Ding.

02:27:14.207 --> 02:27:15.528
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you say Ding, Jamie?

02:27:15.608 --> 02:27:16.148
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I did.

02:27:16.208 --> 02:27:19.131
[SPEAKER_10]: I said, in a major way, on top of, way to listen, Rob.

02:27:19.291 --> 02:27:21.113
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't listening to you because I was thinking of an answer.

02:27:22.194 --> 02:27:24.776
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though I think of the questions before the show, I don't think of the answers.

02:27:25.617 --> 02:27:26.117
[SPEAKER_10]: You know what?

02:27:26.137 --> 02:27:27.819
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a likely story, but I don't believe you.

02:27:28.139 --> 02:27:28.480
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:27:29.020 --> 02:27:30.441
[SPEAKER_04]: An ad for Blank.

02:27:31.102 --> 02:27:31.462
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:27:31.923 --> 02:27:35.266
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like Actdeft is Ding and SSJ100, Matt, you ready with an answer?

02:27:36.192 --> 02:27:36.432
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

02:27:36.632 --> 02:27:36.993
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:27:37.093 --> 02:27:40.675
[SPEAKER_04]: Peter Molyneux recently advertised Goddess on the Cube in Curiosity.

02:27:41.016 --> 02:27:47.801
[SPEAKER_04]: It turns out that what Peter put in the Cube is actually just an ad for... Ovaltine.

02:27:48.181 --> 02:27:49.222
[SPEAKER_04]: Ovaltine.

02:27:49.242 --> 02:27:53.065
[SPEAKER_04]: I like Ovaltine.

02:27:54.858 --> 02:27:55.278
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura

02:28:18.007 --> 02:28:20.989
[SPEAKER_04]: What he put in the cube is actually just an ad for?

02:28:21.289 --> 02:28:21.709
[SPEAKER_04]: Propel.

02:28:22.150 --> 02:28:22.930
[SPEAKER_04]: Propel!

02:28:24.391 --> 02:28:25.552
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going old school tonight.

02:28:25.572 --> 02:28:27.233
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you guys and the references.

02:28:27.313 --> 02:28:27.733
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:28:28.193 --> 02:28:28.734
[SPEAKER_04]: Good answer.

02:28:28.834 --> 02:28:29.294
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a match.

02:28:29.694 --> 02:28:29.915
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:28:29.955 --> 02:28:33.517
[SPEAKER_04]: What Peter put in the cube is actually just an ad for?

02:28:33.637 --> 02:28:33.917
[SPEAKER_04]: Rachel?

02:28:34.778 --> 02:28:36.118
[SPEAKER_04]: Goddess Catch Em All.

02:28:36.579 --> 02:28:38.360
[SPEAKER_04]: Goddess Catch Em All!

02:28:41.371 --> 02:28:42.291
[SPEAKER_12]: It burns, doesn't it?

02:28:43.052 --> 02:28:43.952
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a good burn.

02:28:44.592 --> 02:28:49.335
[SPEAKER_04]: Ladies and gentlemen, who knew that Rachel was the 24th Magus, everybody?

02:28:49.615 --> 02:28:50.416
[SPEAKER_04]: Here in studio.

02:28:52.097 --> 02:28:53.398
[SPEAKER_10]: I will explain this to you.

02:28:53.418 --> 02:28:54.558
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you'll have to explain that later.

02:28:54.979 --> 02:28:55.539
[SPEAKER_10]: Off radio.

02:28:57.554 --> 02:28:58.994
[SPEAKER_07]: Is she going to break a soundboard table now?

02:28:59.575 --> 02:29:00.095
[SPEAKER_04]: She might.

02:29:00.335 --> 02:29:00.675
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

02:29:00.715 --> 02:29:03.316
[SPEAKER_04]: This table's a lot sturdier than the one that Drew broke.

02:29:03.576 --> 02:29:06.857
[SPEAKER_04]: After nobody matches her, she might just flip the table over.

02:29:06.897 --> 02:29:07.277
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

02:29:07.657 --> 02:29:11.699
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Loki, what Peter put in the cube is actually just an ad for?

02:29:12.279 --> 02:29:14.980
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't know how to pronounce this, but I'm going to try to.

02:29:15.200 --> 02:29:17.161
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Schrodinger.

02:29:19.761 --> 02:29:21.242
[SPEAKER_10]: Would it be Schrodinger, Schrodinger's cat?

02:29:22.082 --> 02:29:24.943
[SPEAKER_03]: No, everyone likes cats, so it's just Schrodinger.

02:29:25.764 --> 02:29:26.924
[SPEAKER_11]: See how he likes it.

02:29:28.779 --> 02:29:29.819
[SPEAKER_04]: Clever answer.

02:29:29.859 --> 02:29:31.900
[SPEAKER_04]: That's too intellectual for you, Loki.

02:29:31.960 --> 02:29:32.260
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:29:32.280 --> 02:29:34.121
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.

02:29:34.141 --> 02:29:36.161
[SPEAKER_03]: Should I have said penises or like, you know?

02:29:36.221 --> 02:29:37.742
[SPEAKER_04]: You are a Mensa member after all.

02:29:37.842 --> 02:29:38.182
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:29:39.162 --> 02:29:41.503
[SPEAKER_04]: It is just an ad for, Alan?

02:29:42.303 --> 02:29:44.784
[SPEAKER_05]: Pure, unsubstantiated hype, the video game.

02:29:45.424 --> 02:29:48.625
[SPEAKER_04]: Pure, unsubstantiated hype, the video game.

02:29:49.045 --> 02:29:50.446
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, that's not as good as they say.

02:29:50.867 --> 02:29:51.227
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:29:51.748 --> 02:29:53.089
[SPEAKER_04]: And lastly, my answer.

02:29:53.129 --> 02:29:59.135
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see if it's a match for Actdeft with the VOG Network or whatever Matt said.

02:29:59.175 --> 02:30:00.216
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't even remember now.

02:30:00.336 --> 02:30:00.736
[SPEAKER_04]: Ovaltine.

02:30:00.937 --> 02:30:01.517
[SPEAKER_04]: Ovaltine.

02:30:03.779 --> 02:30:04.160
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is.

02:30:04.380 --> 02:30:08.244
[SPEAKER_04]: Peter Molyneux recently advertised Goddess on the Cube in Curiosity.

02:30:08.884 --> 02:30:13.128
[SPEAKER_04]: It turns out that what Peter put in the cube is actually just an ad for...

02:30:14.107 --> 02:30:14.488
[SPEAKER_04]: Douche.

02:30:15.089 --> 02:30:15.931
[SPEAKER_04]: Good night, everybody.

02:30:18.956 --> 02:30:21.601
[SPEAKER_04]: That's going to conclude the match game tonight.

02:30:22.122 --> 02:30:22.964
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100 Matt wins!

02:30:26.109 --> 02:30:30.151
[SPEAKER_04]: in a score of 2-0, Alan.

02:30:30.171 --> 02:30:30.531
[SPEAKER_04]: 2-0.

02:30:31.232 --> 02:30:31.552
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:30:33.453 --> 02:30:36.995
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, thank you so much for playing, but sorry you're a loser.

02:30:37.035 --> 02:30:37.595
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the door.

02:30:38.195 --> 02:30:40.377
[SPEAKER_04]: SSJ100, Matt, congratulations.

02:30:40.557 --> 02:30:46.040
[SPEAKER_04]: You win, and as the winner, you get to pimp or promote anything you want to on the program tonight.

02:30:48.341 --> 02:30:52.343
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't really have anything to promote, so I'm just going to promote the VOG Network.

02:30:53.867 --> 02:30:57.088
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw, it's like the ad was really in the center after all.

02:30:57.649 --> 02:30:57.989
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:30:58.009 --> 02:30:58.489
[SPEAKER_04]: Feel the love.

02:30:58.509 --> 02:30:59.689
[SPEAKER_11]: You're so nice.

02:30:59.849 --> 02:31:00.710
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the feels.

02:31:01.010 --> 02:31:01.550
[SPEAKER_04]: The feels.

02:31:01.650 --> 02:31:01.950
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:31:02.230 --> 02:31:02.890
[SPEAKER_04]: All the feels.

02:31:03.210 --> 02:31:04.671
[SPEAKER_04]: S2100Mac, congratulations.

02:31:04.691 --> 02:31:07.132
[SPEAKER_04]: You won the first match game on OLR in like a year and a half.

02:31:07.192 --> 02:31:08.952
[SPEAKER_04]: So walk away with that trophy.

02:31:09.392 --> 02:31:11.353
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe somebody will try to take it from you in 2013.

02:31:11.413 --> 02:31:11.953
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

02:31:13.134 --> 02:31:13.594
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

02:31:13.634 --> 02:31:14.214
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good night, buddy.

02:31:15.748 --> 02:31:16.388
[SPEAKER_07]: Have a good night, guys.

02:31:16.488 --> 02:31:16.989
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, bye.

02:31:17.889 --> 02:31:18.889
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, that was fun.

02:31:18.929 --> 02:31:19.249
[SPEAKER_04]: That was fun.

02:31:19.269 --> 02:31:19.990
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to do that again tonight.

02:31:20.230 --> 02:31:24.251
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Alan, for walking in and doing a cameo, not like I pressured you into it or anything.

02:31:24.992 --> 02:31:25.412
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome.

02:31:25.812 --> 02:31:27.873
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, the taquitos were A+.

02:31:28.013 --> 02:31:28.293
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

02:31:28.846 --> 02:31:29.727
[SPEAKER_10]: It was quite delicious.

02:31:29.767 --> 02:31:30.147
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

02:31:30.307 --> 02:31:31.768
[SPEAKER_04]: Alan takes good care of us during the show.

02:31:31.808 --> 02:31:32.449
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate it.

02:31:33.150 --> 02:31:33.470
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:31:34.911 --> 02:31:46.200
[SPEAKER_04]: Let us move on with a few more stories and then we're going to open up the Skype line for regular calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or of course our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:31:46.600 --> 02:31:52.345
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we have more stuff we've got to get to before we get to the stories though such as the mailbag.

02:31:56.588 --> 02:32:06.972
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us your emails and DarkSakura will dive into the mailbag head first and read a few emails that tickles your fancy.

02:32:07.052 --> 02:32:08.293
[SPEAKER_04]: What's inside the mailbag?

02:32:12.233 --> 02:32:21.696
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you ever tried placing your games in a numbered list and picking a number at random?

02:32:22.236 --> 02:32:29.158
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been surprised on many occasions to find out how much fun I've had playing an old game or playing a game I thought I was not in the mood for thanks to this method.

02:32:30.078 --> 02:32:33.679
[SPEAKER_10]: MMORPGs get a number for each character.

02:32:36.408 --> 02:32:37.549
[SPEAKER_10]: Take care and happy gaming.

02:32:59.434 --> 02:33:06.118
[SPEAKER_10]: We tried this and got so wiped out trying to list every freaking game that we own that no.

02:33:06.718 --> 02:33:08.219
[SPEAKER_12]: It spread out to imaginary numbers.

02:33:08.239 --> 02:33:10.061
[SPEAKER_12]: There was algebra involved and it wasn't pretty.

02:33:11.241 --> 02:33:15.124
[SPEAKER_04]: You had to use the E plus 10 and all that stuff to get the games in there.

02:33:15.424 --> 02:33:16.184
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:33:41.291 --> 02:33:42.411
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I do, actually.

02:33:42.672 --> 02:33:43.492
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, here's the other question.

02:33:43.512 --> 02:33:45.292
[SPEAKER_04]: Would each copy of Space Harrier get a number?

02:33:47.813 --> 02:33:48.093
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:33:48.573 --> 02:33:49.133
[SPEAKER_04]: Next email.

02:33:51.214 --> 02:33:52.534
[SPEAKER_10]: Next up.

02:33:53.274 --> 02:33:54.175
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, that was the one I just read.

02:33:56.015 --> 02:33:57.096
[SPEAKER_10]: They're very small.

02:33:57.556 --> 02:33:59.716
[SPEAKER_10]: This one comes from Will.

02:34:01.177 --> 02:34:04.718
[SPEAKER_10]: I strangely enjoy when Rob breaks into the show to give the VOG passphrase.

02:34:04.758 --> 02:34:05.778
[SPEAKER_10]: He sounds so serious.

02:34:07.250 --> 02:34:07.710
[SPEAKER_10]: That's it?

02:34:08.571 --> 02:34:11.874
[SPEAKER_04]: Today's password is cheeseball.

02:34:11.994 --> 02:34:13.295
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not really the password.

02:34:13.515 --> 02:34:13.755
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

02:34:14.416 --> 02:34:14.936
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't pick that.

02:34:14.996 --> 02:34:16.878
[SPEAKER_04]: The password... It's randomly generated.

02:34:16.918 --> 02:34:22.022
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the passphrases get picked for me after the show with a little thing that Bobby wrote.

02:34:22.042 --> 02:34:23.744
[SPEAKER_08]: Today's passcode is cock.

02:34:24.424 --> 02:34:25.045
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's not.

02:34:25.185 --> 02:34:26.066
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't put that in the box.

02:34:26.306 --> 02:34:27.927
[SPEAKER_04]: She doesn't know it because we don't know it until after the show.

02:34:27.947 --> 02:34:28.728
[SPEAKER_08]: What if a elephant did pop up?

02:34:29.008 --> 02:34:32.773
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to have cock because Bobby filtered all the adult words off of it, I'm sure.

02:34:33.253 --> 02:34:34.135
[SPEAKER_12]: Dang it, Bobby!

02:34:35.096 --> 02:34:39.481
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll be spelled with a zero and a five in place of the S. You know what, Bobby?

02:34:39.541 --> 02:34:40.002
[SPEAKER_04]: Remind me.

02:34:40.122 --> 02:34:45.469
[SPEAKER_04]: April Fool's Day next year, people who put naughty words in the box unlock a bar of soap trophy.

02:34:45.569 --> 02:34:46.310
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we make that happen?

02:34:47.150 --> 02:34:48.792
[SPEAKER_10]: You got four months to work on it.

02:34:49.593 --> 02:34:52.836
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a chance for me to re-pimp this, though, because we haven't talked about it in a while.

02:34:53.356 --> 02:35:01.884
[SPEAKER_04]: If you listen to the shows live at vognetwork.com, you can check into the show as the show is happening and get your five VOG points, which go for the loot.

02:35:02.205 --> 02:35:03.466
[SPEAKER_04]: And what do VOG points get you?

02:35:03.966 --> 02:35:05.188
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely nothing.

02:35:05.648 --> 02:35:07.711
[SPEAKER_04]: But what does Foursquare and Facebook check-ins give you?

02:35:07.751 --> 02:35:09.713
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a fun little game within a game.

02:35:10.114 --> 02:35:13.378
[SPEAKER_04]: And someday there may be more to come from it in 2013.

02:35:13.438 --> 02:35:15.160
[SPEAKER_04]: We're throwing around ideas.

02:35:15.180 --> 02:35:15.240
[SPEAKER_04]: But...

02:35:19.665 --> 02:35:20.946
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:35:43.408 --> 02:35:50.350
[SPEAKER_04]: Although you still can check in just to register yourself as you listen to the podcast and you listen live just to see if there were any differences.

02:35:51.050 --> 02:35:52.171
[SPEAKER_04]: But you don't get the extra points.

02:35:52.431 --> 02:35:54.031
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyhow, we hope you'll play along.

02:35:54.291 --> 02:36:01.193
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a fun thing to do at vognetwork.com and we do look to adding some fun little no prizes.

02:36:01.253 --> 02:36:05.675
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe the person with the most amount of points will get to program the station for a day.

02:36:05.795 --> 02:36:06.935
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm throwing it out there.

02:36:07.335 --> 02:36:08.195
[SPEAKER_04]: These aren't actual things.

02:36:08.476 --> 02:36:09.656
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're looking to doing things like that.

02:36:09.716 --> 02:36:12.317
[SPEAKER_10]: Translated to give Bobby a migraine for a day.

02:36:14.197 --> 02:36:18.599
[SPEAKER_04]: And Tiger Claw and Actdeft in chat remind us, bragging rights is what you get.

02:36:18.840 --> 02:36:19.620
[SPEAKER_04]: Bragging rights.

02:36:19.980 --> 02:36:24.542
[SPEAKER_10]: I like no prizes like Marvel used to do where the people would just get a blank envelope.

02:36:24.822 --> 02:36:36.808
[SPEAKER_04]: I think maybe in 2013 what we should do, especially since we're all getting into, like you're doing crocheting and all these different projects, we should give our leaderboard leader every month a homemade prize for

02:36:37.208 --> 02:36:38.629
[SPEAKER_04]: That means I have to make it.

02:36:38.649 --> 02:36:39.949
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, it doesn't have to be you every time.

02:36:40.089 --> 02:36:40.429
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do one.

02:36:40.449 --> 02:36:41.910
[SPEAKER_09]: We can make something out of popsicle sticks.

02:36:42.410 --> 02:36:44.451
[SPEAKER_04]: But remember, there's more than just us on VOG.

02:36:44.651 --> 02:36:44.991
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.

02:36:45.791 --> 02:36:47.111
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be like, you know, one week.

02:36:47.171 --> 02:36:51.553
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be maybe Brad from PodCulture could send, you know, something homemade.

02:36:51.573 --> 02:36:52.393
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what we should do.

02:36:53.294 --> 02:36:53.994
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a contest.

02:36:54.074 --> 02:36:55.034
[SPEAKER_10]: It starts in January.

02:36:55.634 --> 02:36:55.975
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay?

02:36:56.535 --> 02:37:04.397
[SPEAKER_10]: Whoever gets the top of the leaderboard the most times in the period of a year gets an orange beanie crocheted by me.

02:37:04.417 --> 02:37:04.838
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

02:37:06.328 --> 02:37:07.229
[SPEAKER_04]: Last email, this comes from Travis

02:37:31.127 --> 02:37:32.248
[SPEAKER_10]: No, not Donovan.

02:37:33.408 --> 02:37:34.049
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, gang.

02:37:34.169 --> 02:37:35.369
[SPEAKER_10]: Haven't wrote or called in a while.

02:37:35.449 --> 02:37:40.112
[SPEAKER_10]: Thought I would drop a line and say, hey, I got a Wii U over the weekend and heard Rob talking about his last episode.

02:37:40.732 --> 02:37:41.893
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm happy with it so far.

02:37:42.093 --> 02:37:43.253
[SPEAKER_10]: I have an eight-yo.

02:37:43.654 --> 02:37:44.234
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, year old.

02:37:46.096 --> 02:37:47.577
[SPEAKER_10]: and he absolutely loves it.

02:37:47.697 --> 02:37:49.639
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, friends and family have a blast with it too.

02:37:50.199 --> 02:37:54.182
[SPEAKER_10]: Just wondering, after a week of having it, what do you think?

02:37:54.983 --> 02:37:55.303
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob?

02:37:56.024 --> 02:37:56.764
[SPEAKER_11]: Get out of the fridge.

02:37:56.784 --> 02:37:57.605
[SPEAKER_11]: Come answer the question.

02:37:57.625 --> 02:37:58.606
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted an Oreo.

02:37:58.686 --> 02:37:59.427
[SPEAKER_11]: I want an Oreo.

02:37:59.987 --> 02:38:00.327
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

02:38:02.188 --> 02:38:03.169
[SPEAKER_04]: You want an Oreo too, Rachel?

02:38:03.449 --> 02:38:04.009
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get you an Oreo later.

02:38:04.069 --> 02:38:04.349
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm good.

02:38:04.509 --> 02:38:05.309
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:38:07.370 --> 02:38:09.170
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I talked about the Wii U at the top of the show.

02:38:09.210 --> 02:38:10.551
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think I have a lot else to add.

02:38:11.051 --> 02:38:13.832
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not disappointed with my investment.

02:38:14.192 --> 02:38:20.554
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, how important is Mario and Nintendo Land and some of these like Zombie U?

02:38:20.614 --> 02:38:22.155
[SPEAKER_04]: How important are those games to you?

02:38:22.275 --> 02:38:25.356
[SPEAKER_04]: If you think you can wait on those games till 2013, then wait.

02:38:25.776 --> 02:38:29.777
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you want to play them now and you have the financial resources available to play them now,

02:38:29.997 --> 02:38:30.658
[SPEAKER_04]: Then go get one.

02:38:31.459 --> 02:38:31.880
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun.

02:38:33.602 --> 02:38:34.143
[SPEAKER_09]: Keep talking.

02:38:36.466 --> 02:38:37.147
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm done.

02:38:37.167 --> 02:38:44.177
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I have to say on the Wii U. I talked for like 40 minutes during part A. Oreos from the fridge are the best.

02:38:45.178 --> 02:38:46.320
[SPEAKER_11]: Matt, you want one?

02:38:47.000 --> 02:38:47.181
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

02:38:48.041 --> 02:38:49.002
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not want an Oreo.

02:38:49.442 --> 02:38:52.725
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm pretty excited about Lego City, a new Zelda and an F-Zero game.

02:38:53.705 --> 02:38:59.590
[SPEAKER_10]: Being a PlayStation fanboy and a PC gamer, I have to say I'm not blown away, but still very impressed with it.

02:38:59.610 --> 02:39:00.331
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's all in caps.

02:39:00.351 --> 02:39:01.531
[SPEAKER_10]: How else am I supposed to emote that?

02:39:03.213 --> 02:39:07.416
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, by the way, I friend requested you, but we'll have to do it again under a different name.

02:39:07.456 --> 02:39:11.179
[SPEAKER_10]: Long story short, I had to get a replacement system as my first one I purchased was faulty.

02:39:11.699 --> 02:39:11.959
[SPEAKER_10]: Quoty.

02:39:12.200 --> 02:39:12.500
[SPEAKER_10]: Faulty.

02:39:14.161 --> 02:39:14.982
[SPEAKER_04]: That sucks.

02:39:15.802 --> 02:39:16.963
[SPEAKER_04]: You have some bad luck.

02:39:17.564 --> 02:39:17.744
[SPEAKER_09]: Done.

02:39:21.678 --> 02:39:29.040
[SPEAKER_04]: Jason is quick to correct me in the chat room at live.vognetwork.com Gmail hasn't been in beta for more than a few years now.

02:39:29.440 --> 02:39:30.060
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever.

02:39:31.220 --> 02:39:34.341
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been in beta for like, what, eight months?

02:39:35.341 --> 02:39:37.561
[SPEAKER_04]: Gmail was in beta for like six years.

02:39:38.481 --> 02:39:39.342
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a ways to go.

02:39:39.722 --> 02:39:40.702
[SPEAKER_12]: Hyperbole what now?

02:39:42.662 --> 02:39:42.942
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:39:44.203 --> 02:39:46.063
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get into the FUs of the week.

02:40:01.892 --> 02:40:09.036
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, Rachel, since you're new to the FUs of the Week, I don't know if Jamie told you about this in the car ride, but this is the part of the show where we just get to rant.

02:40:09.616 --> 02:40:09.976
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

02:40:10.517 --> 02:40:11.677
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, because we have your attention.

02:40:11.857 --> 02:40:13.799
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I have your attention, I like to rant.

02:40:14.199 --> 02:40:14.979
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's the FUs of the Week.

02:40:15.660 --> 02:40:16.160
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura?

02:40:16.560 --> 02:40:18.221
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't particularly have an FU.

02:40:18.961 --> 02:40:23.104
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a thank you to someone for saving me the trouble of doing what I planned on doing anyway.

02:40:25.625 --> 02:40:26.285
[SPEAKER_04]: Hiding a body?

02:40:27.026 --> 02:40:27.146
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

02:40:28.055 --> 02:40:28.476
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

02:40:29.197 --> 02:40:29.637
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Loki.

02:40:30.618 --> 02:40:36.426
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to do the whole ride over here because for some reason, like, everybody was out to try to kill me or something on the road.

02:40:36.846 --> 02:40:38.829
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, there's a dude... I hate it when they do this.

02:40:39.109 --> 02:40:42.613
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, when there's people waiting to, like, pull out of an inner... either, like, a...

02:40:43.254 --> 02:40:44.314
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

02:41:08.991 --> 02:41:10.534
[SPEAKER_03]: Take fucking attention, people.

02:41:10.575 --> 02:41:11.958
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, you're going to kill somebody.

02:41:12.920 --> 02:41:13.621
[SPEAKER_03]: And hopefully not me.

02:41:14.922 --> 02:41:35.366
[SPEAKER_04]: My FU of the week goes to Oreos for being so delicious and addicting Oh my god, but no, the other thing about that is I want to give an FU to the fact that I never got to have the birthday cake Oreos because they disappeared from shelves so fast and, and, real problems guys I never got to have the candy corn Oreos because they disappeared from shelves so fast Why can I make these special Oreos if I can't find them?

02:41:35.606 --> 02:41:41.887
[SPEAKER_04]: And while I'm at it, FU to the fact that there are no pumpkin kisses this year That is a travesty

02:41:43.109 --> 02:41:44.089
[SPEAKER_04]: True Travesty.

02:41:44.449 --> 02:41:47.190
[SPEAKER_10]: Didn't you hold on to like a pack of those for like six months?

02:41:47.250 --> 02:41:48.770
[SPEAKER_04]: I did and they were still delicious.

02:41:49.490 --> 02:41:50.291
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry not sorry.

02:41:51.331 --> 02:41:52.551
[SPEAKER_10]: I partook of them too.

02:41:52.931 --> 02:41:54.172
[SPEAKER_10]: eBay changed their logo!

02:41:54.792 --> 02:41:55.932
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like months ago.

02:41:56.052 --> 02:41:59.313
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but I haven't looked at eBay in months.

02:42:00.413 --> 02:42:03.234
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, and last but not least, Rachel, do you have any FUs you want to get out?

02:42:04.414 --> 02:42:09.135
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you know, I'd like to say FU to Michael Bay because, you know, you can never FU that guy enough.

02:42:09.827 --> 02:42:12.428
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, on eBay, they are... That is a worthy first FU.

02:42:12.468 --> 02:42:12.888
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job.

02:42:12.928 --> 02:42:13.268
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job.

02:42:13.328 --> 02:42:16.209
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, on eBay, they are selling those candy corn Oreos.

02:42:17.510 --> 02:42:18.110
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck eBay.

02:42:18.990 --> 02:42:20.971
[SPEAKER_04]: Limited edition, like... 15 bucks.

02:42:21.191 --> 02:42:24.992
[SPEAKER_04]: Brad from PodCulture says, Rob Roberts, try the gingerbread Oreos.

02:42:26.293 --> 02:42:28.193
[SPEAKER_04]: They have gingerbread Oreos?

02:42:28.733 --> 02:42:29.774
[SPEAKER_10]: I need this in my life.

02:42:30.014 --> 02:42:30.734
[SPEAKER_10]: Ermager!

02:42:31.734 --> 02:42:32.435
[SPEAKER_10]: I need this in my life.

02:42:32.455 --> 02:42:32.975
[SPEAKER_04]: Gingerbread!

02:42:36.010 --> 02:42:38.192
[SPEAKER_10]: I need a cat in my life, Rob.

02:43:05.151 --> 02:43:09.153
[SPEAKER_03]: However, because, no, not day one, because of their DRM.

02:43:09.813 --> 02:43:17.836
[SPEAKER_03]: They said, though, that the extra sales that they got at that time had helped them have new staff members for this year's release for Football Manager 13.

02:43:18.896 --> 02:43:25.959
[SPEAKER_03]: And had they been hired day one, they probably wouldn't have the money to have the extra staff.

02:43:26.699 --> 02:43:27.020
[SPEAKER_03]: So...

02:43:28.260 --> 02:43:44.906
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right now, I guess the new game has a new DRM system, and as of right now, hasn't been cracked, although they haven't, I don't know when that came out, and they said that if they can hold on for three or four more weeks, then it'll really benefit retailers and themselves.

02:43:48.186 --> 02:43:48.826
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it working?

02:43:50.187 --> 02:43:58.511
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's good when it works in the effort to get people to actually legitimately buy your copies of your games.

02:43:59.131 --> 02:44:11.617
[SPEAKER_03]: However, when you have it implemented in a way like Ubisoft does, where it hurts the actual consumers that buy your games and kind of punishes them, whereas the person that has the cracked copy has no issues, then that's the problem.

02:44:11.637 --> 02:44:13.418
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just kind of have to find that happy medium in there.

02:44:13.965 --> 02:44:21.808
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of think it's interesting how they talk about that like, you know, as long as we can hold off like three weeks before we get cracked, then we'll be good.

02:44:21.888 --> 02:44:23.529
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll still sell a lot of copies of the game.

02:44:23.889 --> 02:44:27.891
[SPEAKER_04]: I find it interesting that they just kind of give into the fact that like, yeah, hackers gonna hack.

02:44:28.111 --> 02:44:29.631
[SPEAKER_04]: They're gonna get into the game eventually.

02:44:30.112 --> 02:44:36.034
[SPEAKER_04]: But it also, you know, that mentality that the majority, the vast majority of games are in their first week.

02:44:36.654 --> 02:44:43.037
[SPEAKER_04]: So I find it very interesting that it's like, as long as we can hold off to week three, enough people will have bought it by then that whatever at that point.

02:44:43.937 --> 02:45:08.908
[SPEAKER_04]: very interesting but uh yeah I also agree with what Loki said as long as you know anti-piracy you got to do what you got to do but as long as it works so all right uh moving on to one more story tonight I can't believe this but uh if you're in Finland you've got some weird taste that's all I gotta say no offense but you guys have some weird taste you know what panties

02:45:09.928 --> 02:45:10.148
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

02:45:10.909 --> 02:45:13.329
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yes, but it means something different in Finnish.

02:45:13.790 --> 02:45:18.871
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, she's referring to what is written on the can for Angry Birds Soda.

02:45:19.552 --> 02:45:22.533
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Angry Birds has been licensed for everything.

02:45:22.613 --> 02:45:27.935
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure there's Angry Birds diapers at this point and whatever, even here in America.

02:45:28.035 --> 02:45:31.176
[SPEAKER_04]: But over in Finland, they have Angry Birds Soda.

02:45:31.816 --> 02:45:33.437
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's the crazy thing about it.

02:45:34.777 --> 02:45:38.779
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually outselling Coke and Pepsi in Finland.

02:45:40.132 --> 02:45:40.453
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

02:45:42.443 --> 02:45:42.905
[SPEAKER_12]: Alright then.

02:45:43.856 --> 02:45:50.339
[SPEAKER_04]: Peter Vesterbacca from Rovio says that the soda will make its way to Australia and New Zealand in the near future.

02:45:51.119 --> 02:45:53.240
[SPEAKER_04]: And they say it will probably come to the U.S.

02:45:53.300 --> 02:45:54.641
[SPEAKER_04]: eventually as well.

02:45:55.461 --> 02:45:59.663
[SPEAKER_04]: So could Angry Birds someday outsell Coke and Pepsi here in America?

02:45:59.983 --> 02:46:01.444
[SPEAKER_12]: I can only hope it's smelt flavored.

02:46:02.385 --> 02:46:03.885
[SPEAKER_10]: In Alabama, everything is a Coke.

02:46:04.345 --> 02:46:05.726
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't matter what drink it is, it's Coke.

02:46:05.746 --> 02:46:06.786
[SPEAKER_12]: So I doubt it.

02:46:07.487 --> 02:46:09.148
[SPEAKER_12]: Unless you're in the Midwest, then it becomes pop.

02:46:09.448 --> 02:46:10.088
[SPEAKER_12]: Everything's pop.

02:46:10.268 --> 02:46:10.929
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I hate that.

02:46:11.029 --> 02:46:12.010
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's like nails on chalkboard.

02:46:12.030 --> 02:46:12.550
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate pop.

02:46:12.650 --> 02:46:16.053
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate... Pop is what you do to bubble gum, not soda.

02:46:16.293 --> 02:46:17.574
[SPEAKER_03]: How about a sody pop?

02:46:17.934 --> 02:46:18.695
[SPEAKER_04]: No!

02:46:19.376 --> 02:46:23.119
[SPEAKER_04]: Soda pop was the name of one of the boxers in the original Punch-Out!!

02:46:24.440 --> 02:46:25.721
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where it stays.

02:46:27.082 --> 02:46:33.107
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna be weird one of these days when Mario becomes less recognizable to Red Bird.

02:46:35.222 --> 02:46:36.864
[SPEAKER_03]: Give the birds fucking names!

02:46:37.224 --> 02:46:38.165
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, seriously.

02:46:39.006 --> 02:46:48.135
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to continue a trend of streamlining the shape and the name to the point where it's just going to be a dot on the screen and it will be because spelling the entire word is tiring.

02:46:49.161 --> 02:46:56.747
[SPEAKER_04]: The Skype line is now open at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

02:46:57.307 --> 02:47:01.790
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.

02:47:01.850 --> 02:47:03.091
[SPEAKER_04]: The Skype line is open.

02:47:03.251 --> 02:47:04.252
[SPEAKER_03]: And there you go, Nintendo.

02:47:04.272 --> 02:47:16.121
[SPEAKER_03]: You can totally rip off Angry Birds by creating bullet bills and then having its own game where you're just firing bullet bills and have them, I don't know, do something.

02:47:17.482 --> 02:47:18.423
[SPEAKER_03]: You can combat this.

02:47:19.321 --> 02:47:20.062
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, hello One more time

02:47:46.961 --> 02:47:48.301
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you got to call Echo123.

02:47:48.721 --> 02:47:49.001
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:47:49.842 --> 02:47:50.822
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's try another call.

02:47:50.882 --> 02:47:51.902
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:47:51.922 --> 02:47:52.302
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

02:47:53.942 --> 02:47:55.343
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, this is Duke Nukem.

02:47:56.583 --> 02:47:59.444
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering, what's your guys' favorite Thanksgiving item?

02:47:59.464 --> 02:48:01.804
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't think it's been mentioned yet this episode.

02:48:02.624 --> 02:48:06.945
[SPEAKER_04]: Duke Nukem wants to know, what is everybody's favorite Thanksgiving item?

02:48:06.985 --> 02:48:09.126
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we haven't mentioned it yet this episode.

02:48:09.486 --> 02:48:10.346
[SPEAKER_04]: What a good question.

02:48:10.366 --> 02:48:12.626
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so happy it has absolutely nothing to do with video games.

02:48:12.666 --> 02:48:13.966
[SPEAKER_04]: But we like to take a break once in a while.

02:48:14.267 --> 02:48:16.247
[SPEAKER_04]: What's more important than video games, Duke Nukem?

02:48:18.766 --> 02:48:19.126
[SPEAKER_04]: Food!

02:48:19.447 --> 02:48:19.807
[SPEAKER_04]: Food!

02:48:19.907 --> 02:48:20.488
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the answer.

02:48:20.749 --> 02:48:22.291
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you say?

02:48:22.771 --> 02:48:24.093
[SPEAKER_04]: Never mind.

02:48:24.333 --> 02:48:26.376
[SPEAKER_04]: What's more important than video games, Duke Nukem?

02:48:28.427 --> 02:48:30.128
[SPEAKER_10]: Pie, the answer is pie.

02:48:30.248 --> 02:48:31.608
[SPEAKER_10]: No, the answer is Cox.

02:48:31.848 --> 02:48:32.068
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

02:48:32.649 --> 02:48:33.509
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, all right.

02:48:34.009 --> 02:48:36.390
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go around and get everybody's... Sorry, my phone is going out.

02:48:36.670 --> 02:48:37.490
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all right, that's all right.

02:48:37.750 --> 02:48:39.851
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go around and get everybody's answers here for you.

02:48:39.911 --> 02:48:42.312
[SPEAKER_04]: So what is everybody's favorite Thanksgiving item?

02:48:42.832 --> 02:48:43.552
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

02:48:43.752 --> 02:48:44.113
[SPEAKER_11]: Garris.

02:48:45.853 --> 02:48:46.694
[SPEAKER_04]: Cooked Garris?

02:48:47.574 --> 02:48:48.314
[SPEAKER_11]: No, oh, cooked?

02:48:48.334 --> 02:48:55.797
[SPEAKER_10]: Calibrated to a crisp brown... You know, it has to be actually the chocolate chip pumpkin pie that Becky helped me make.

02:48:56.557 --> 02:48:57.938
[SPEAKER_04]: Chocolate chip pumpkin pie.

02:48:58.178 --> 02:48:58.759
[SPEAKER_10]: It was epic.

02:48:59.119 --> 02:48:59.479
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:48:59.779 --> 02:49:00.020
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:49:00.620 --> 02:49:00.940
[SPEAKER_04]: Rachel.

02:49:01.060 --> 02:49:03.742
[SPEAKER_04]: Turkey skin.

02:49:03.962 --> 02:49:04.903
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, what, Duke Nukem?

02:49:06.933 --> 02:49:08.975
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody has to claim the bacon-wrapped turkey.

02:49:09.956 --> 02:49:10.577
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's right.

02:49:12.318 --> 02:49:13.179
[SPEAKER_09]: That's just nasty.

02:49:13.940 --> 02:49:14.680
[SPEAKER_04]: Swanson, yes.

02:49:14.780 --> 02:49:15.161
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

02:49:15.781 --> 02:49:19.465
[SPEAKER_04]: One more time, Rachel, because I got distracted by... It's turkey skin.

02:49:19.485 --> 02:49:21.366
[SPEAKER_12]: Turkey skin.

02:49:21.527 --> 02:49:24.249
[SPEAKER_12]: You have to say it like that, because otherwise, what is even the point?

02:49:24.930 --> 02:49:25.210
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:49:25.230 --> 02:49:25.911
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

02:49:26.011 --> 02:49:26.251
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

02:49:27.120 --> 02:49:30.903
[SPEAKER_03]: Yams and pumpkin pie I don't know why, it's just like they...

02:49:56.838 --> 02:50:02.301
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, they have this sweet yet, I don't know, sour kind of flavor the way my grandma makes them.

02:50:03.082 --> 02:50:04.762
[SPEAKER_00]: She puts a little bit of lemon juice in there.

02:50:04.782 --> 02:50:07.904
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like this thing that you don't have any other day of the year.

02:50:08.745 --> 02:50:09.985
[SPEAKER_00]: And you always look forward to it.

02:50:10.025 --> 02:50:13.207
[SPEAKER_00]: Just that one dish is worth another 364 days.

02:50:14.007 --> 02:50:15.989
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a really sweet, sentimental answer.

02:50:16.069 --> 02:50:23.673
[SPEAKER_04]: But I can tell that you're an imposter, Duke Nukem, because the real Duke Nukem would have said, my favorite Thanksgiving food is kicking ass.

02:50:25.600 --> 02:50:30.462
[SPEAKER_00]: No, his favorite Thanksgiving food would be bubble gum and he'd be chewing it.

02:50:30.482 --> 02:50:32.583
[SPEAKER_04]: The one day of the year he actually gets to chew gum.

02:50:32.923 --> 02:50:35.424
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, any other thoughts for the listeners before I let you go?

02:50:37.745 --> 02:50:41.967
[SPEAKER_00]: No, just happy holidays you guys and keep on listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:50:41.987 --> 02:50:43.288
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this show.

02:50:43.388 --> 02:50:45.289
[SPEAKER_04]: We will keep listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:50:45.349 --> 02:50:45.769
[SPEAKER_04]: You too.

02:50:45.929 --> 02:50:49.390
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't listen to a damn thing anybody else on this show says.

02:50:49.951 --> 02:50:50.651
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, what's that?

02:50:51.917 --> 02:50:56.100
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so the listeners, not the people who keep putting it out there, of course.

02:50:56.220 --> 02:50:57.762
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are the hosts.

02:50:58.042 --> 02:50:59.363
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine, I'll stop listening.

02:50:59.683 --> 02:51:01.965
[SPEAKER_10]: Seriously, fuck those guys.

02:51:02.625 --> 02:51:04.107
[SPEAKER_04]: We really appreciate it, Duke Newcomb.

02:51:04.367 --> 02:51:05.648
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for the question and take care.

02:51:06.977 --> 02:51:07.637
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, take care

02:51:23.542 --> 02:51:24.223
[SPEAKER_03]: Patch Update 1.5

02:51:46.243 --> 02:51:55.087
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, they're saying variable signal strength stuff, as well as some additions to the minecarts, ways to link minecarts together.

02:51:56.288 --> 02:52:01.450
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, they're saying they're going to have a special block that's going to allow people to dump off cargo.

02:52:01.810 --> 02:52:09.134
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like a lot of stuff they were kind of inspired by Tekkit, where they're going to have piping systems for you moving stuff to chests and that kind of thing.

02:52:11.035 --> 02:52:11.475
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty cool.

02:52:11.535 --> 02:52:16.698
[SPEAKER_03]: And also some new nether-based ore that I guess will be used to make capacitors.

02:52:16.838 --> 02:52:19.179
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let me hold that thought while we go to the phones.

02:52:19.239 --> 02:52:20.199
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:52:20.219 --> 02:52:20.599
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

02:52:23.181 --> 02:52:24.821
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the dead call again.

02:52:25.622 --> 02:52:26.222
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you're muted.

02:52:26.262 --> 02:52:26.702
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

02:52:27.383 --> 02:52:27.903
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

02:52:28.903 --> 02:52:29.364
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

02:52:30.324 --> 02:52:30.744
[SPEAKER_04]: Goodbye.

02:52:31.425 --> 02:52:32.825
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's try another one here.

02:52:33.206 --> 02:52:34.186
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

02:52:34.206 --> 02:52:34.586
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's this?

02:52:35.227 --> 02:52:36.327
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one and only Ranma.

02:52:36.487 --> 02:52:36.967
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Ranma.

02:52:37.027 --> 02:52:37.848
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a good Ranma!

02:52:41.455 --> 02:52:42.396
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing, Ranma?

02:52:43.836 --> 02:52:47.256
[SPEAKER_06]: Alive, awake, stuffed, and full.

02:52:48.157 --> 02:52:48.837
[SPEAKER_06]: Full of what?

02:52:50.177 --> 02:52:53.397
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, Thanksgiving dinner.

02:52:53.878 --> 02:52:55.558
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your favorite Thanksgiving meal?

02:52:56.078 --> 02:52:57.038
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Thanksgiving dish?

02:52:58.278 --> 02:53:00.099
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet potato pie.

02:53:00.219 --> 02:53:01.219
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet potatoes.

02:53:01.239 --> 02:53:01.899
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, lovely.

02:53:02.219 --> 02:53:02.879
[SPEAKER_04]: Sweet potatoes.

02:53:03.199 --> 02:53:05.519
[SPEAKER_04]: Our Friendsgiving had mashed sweet potatoes.

02:53:06.120 --> 02:53:06.640
[SPEAKER_11]: Good stuff.

02:53:08.993 --> 02:53:09.793
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's on your mind, buddy?

02:53:09.993 --> 02:53:10.494
[SPEAKER_06]: Why'd you call?

02:53:11.154 --> 02:53:17.617
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, first off, in response about talking about eating Oreos earlier, I can't eat one.

02:53:17.657 --> 02:53:18.797
[SPEAKER_06]: It's considered cannibalism.

02:53:19.177 --> 02:53:21.618
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not repeat the joke you made in chat.

02:53:21.998 --> 02:53:23.199
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want an explicit tag this week.

02:53:23.219 --> 02:53:24.279
[SPEAKER_06]: Leave me just like that.

02:53:25.500 --> 02:53:25.900
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:53:28.101 --> 02:53:30.122
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, this is a PG-13 podcast.

02:53:30.222 --> 02:53:31.302
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, yes, exactly.

02:53:31.342 --> 02:53:32.142
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what else is on your mind?

02:53:32.182 --> 02:53:34.523
[SPEAKER_10]: However, I'll allow you to say it if you get me that $65 Garris figure.

02:53:37.025 --> 02:53:37.685
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't listen to her.

02:53:38.566 --> 02:53:42.048
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to talk to my accountant right now, so yeah.

02:53:43.689 --> 02:53:45.750
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's going on in your gaming world, Ranma?

02:53:48.152 --> 02:53:48.992
[SPEAKER_06]: Not too much.

02:53:50.513 --> 02:54:04.182
[SPEAKER_06]: The only game I've been doing has been on my tablet, and I was checking eBay on Saturday, and I'm like, wow, I really kind of feel bad for those people who stood on those long lines to grab a Wii U just to flip it, because you know what?

02:54:04.702 --> 02:54:05.863
[SPEAKER_06]: That was going to be me.

02:54:08.438 --> 02:54:10.520
[SPEAKER_04]: I ain't got pity in the world for those people.

02:54:10.620 --> 02:54:16.966
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if you had done it yourself, Ranma, I would have said, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

02:54:17.807 --> 02:54:18.287
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Ranma.

02:54:19.008 --> 02:54:19.268
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

02:54:19.348 --> 02:54:19.669
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha.

02:54:21.571 --> 02:54:23.733
[SPEAKER_06]: The most expensive one I saw was $405 with 70 bids.

02:54:28.191 --> 02:54:28.471
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

02:54:28.531 --> 02:54:36.180
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, you know, it's just either people are resisting or it's just it's not that hard to come by right now.

02:54:36.641 --> 02:54:43.108
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you can still find basics on shelves in some places and some people are just saying, you know what, I'd rather buy a basic than buy from an eBay flipper.

02:54:44.019 --> 02:54:44.399
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

02:54:44.719 --> 02:54:49.482
[SPEAKER_06]: And I remember during the whole Wii U sales, they were going as high as $2,500, $3,000.

02:54:51.763 --> 02:55:02.009
[SPEAKER_06]: And I saw ads where you would get Wii, all the released games, 5.1 surround sound system, 50-inch LCD TV.

02:55:02.289 --> 02:55:07.012
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll dress up as Santa and bring it to your house and deliver it for your kids on Christmas Day.

02:55:07.992 --> 02:55:08.973
[SPEAKER_04]: Good Lord.

02:55:09.113 --> 02:55:10.194
[SPEAKER_04]: How much did that go for?

02:55:10.916 --> 02:55:11.937
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are going as high as $3,000.

02:55:11.997 --> 02:55:15.520
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a bad deal for all that shit.

02:55:16.981 --> 02:55:24.388
[SPEAKER_04]: I expect to see something like that around the holidays for the Wii U. Ranma, will you dress up as Santa and come over to my house and give out the presents?

02:55:25.048 --> 02:55:26.249
[SPEAKER_12]: Does it come with full release?

02:55:29.933 --> 02:55:30.313
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

02:55:32.255 --> 02:55:34.517
[SPEAKER_04]: Does my visit from Santa come with a happy ending?

02:55:37.907 --> 02:55:40.527
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob, that was bad and you should feel bad.

02:55:41.008 --> 02:55:41.448
[SPEAKER_04]: I do.

02:55:42.488 --> 02:55:44.268
[SPEAKER_06]: It ain't Black Santa, it's Mary Kwanzaa, fool!

02:55:48.529 --> 02:55:49.989
[SPEAKER_10]: I pity you through the dual light candles.

02:55:51.949 --> 02:55:52.370
[SPEAKER_06]: How's that?

02:55:53.510 --> 02:55:54.070
[SPEAKER_06]: Close enough.

02:55:54.090 --> 02:55:56.410
[SPEAKER_06]: Time for me to wear my Mary Kwanzaa bitch's shirt again.

02:55:56.690 --> 02:56:00.151
[SPEAKER_04]: How about I send you over to Jamie's house on Christmas because that would be hilarious.

02:56:02.111 --> 02:56:06.632
[SPEAKER_06]: If you send me to Jamie's house for Christmas, I might not leave because you know she has that southern cooking I love.

02:56:07.968 --> 02:56:09.109
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I can do it too.

02:56:10.550 --> 02:56:13.732
[SPEAKER_10]: I will make grits and mashed potatoes.

02:56:15.854 --> 02:56:17.555
[SPEAKER_04]: Grits and mashed potatoes!

02:56:17.995 --> 02:56:28.363
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to totally advertise this to all the listeners everywhere, but Alan and I have been talking about starting a new Christmas tradition out of the one we started last year.

02:56:28.783 --> 02:56:31.005
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is taking our Jewish friends...

02:56:31.505 --> 02:56:33.566
[SPEAKER_04]: to Asian food on Christmas.

02:56:33.747 --> 02:56:34.207
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

02:56:34.247 --> 02:56:34.807
[SPEAKER_10]: We did that.

02:56:34.827 --> 02:56:35.388
[SPEAKER_04]: We did that last year.

02:56:35.648 --> 02:56:36.989
[SPEAKER_10]: We went out for pho, didn't we?

02:56:37.009 --> 02:56:37.509
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we did.

02:56:37.589 --> 02:56:39.831
[SPEAKER_04]: So Alan and I want to extend that again this year.

02:56:39.851 --> 02:56:41.171
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm down for that.

02:56:41.312 --> 02:56:42.933
[SPEAKER_04]: We might try to get some other people to come along this year.

02:56:42.953 --> 02:56:44.754
[SPEAKER_10]: We even sort of made a half joke.

02:56:45.654 --> 02:56:50.117
[SPEAKER_10]: Two gay men and a Jew walk into a Vietnamese restaurant.

02:56:50.137 --> 02:56:51.238
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a new sitcom.

02:56:51.398 --> 02:56:53.680
[SPEAKER_04]: Two gay men and a Jew at a Vietnamese restaurant.

02:56:53.700 --> 02:56:56.241
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know the punchline, but there's one in there somewhere.

02:56:57.182 --> 02:57:01.345
[SPEAKER_06]: Jumas has been a long-time tradition in my house for the last seven years.

02:57:01.745 --> 02:57:02.706
[SPEAKER_06]: Chris McQuanzica.

02:57:03.486 --> 02:57:04.187
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

02:57:04.307 --> 02:57:04.787
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

02:57:05.167 --> 02:57:05.888
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Ranma.

02:57:05.988 --> 02:57:07.549
[SPEAKER_10]: I was calling it Holiday Mass.

02:57:07.829 --> 02:57:09.550
[SPEAKER_04]: Merry Festivus to you.

02:57:09.570 --> 02:57:13.132
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for the rest of us.

02:57:13.212 --> 02:57:14.914
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's nothing else, then I'm going to let you go.

02:57:15.754 --> 02:57:16.214
[SPEAKER_04]: Works for me.

02:57:16.495 --> 02:57:17.155
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, take care, buddy.

02:57:17.695 --> 02:57:17.916
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

02:57:18.116 --> 02:57:18.336
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

02:57:19.477 --> 02:57:21.378
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm telling you guys, the Oreo joke was really bad.

02:57:21.778 --> 02:57:22.938
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line.

02:57:22.958 --> 02:57:25.319
[SPEAKER_04]: We're running way over three hours tonight, so I'm going to wrap it up.

02:57:25.359 --> 02:57:28.780
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry to those that didn't get through, but if you didn't get through, you should send us an email.

02:57:28.840 --> 02:57:34.722
[SPEAKER_04]: Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Or you can always send us a tweet or any of that stuff.

02:57:35.143 --> 02:57:37.083
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to let Loki finish up the last minute stories.

02:57:37.764 --> 02:57:38.964
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got to get to Twitter topics too.

02:57:39.524 --> 02:57:44.188
[SPEAKER_03]: One last thing, there was another app that was announced called Minecraft Reality.

02:57:44.648 --> 02:57:53.015
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an augmented reality app for iOS, and it can display 3D Minecraft images in the real world, and you can walk around them and stuff.

02:57:53.536 --> 02:57:55.617
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looked pretty cool from the little trailer that they had.

02:57:56.238 --> 02:57:57.859
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can check that out.

02:57:57.999 --> 02:58:00.341
[SPEAKER_03]: It's $2 to download.

02:58:03.217 --> 02:58:07.099
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually have a last minute story because this just finished while we were doing the show tonight.

02:58:07.139 --> 02:58:11.540
[SPEAKER_04]: The Kickstarter for the Shadowgate reboot has ended and they made it.

02:58:12.201 --> 02:58:15.062
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Shadowgate reimagining is going to be happening.

02:58:15.642 --> 02:58:16.262
[SPEAKER_03]: Which one?

02:58:18.851 --> 02:58:27.133
[SPEAKER_04]: Shadowgate Shadowrun The old school NES game and Mac game Deja Vu, etc.

02:58:27.473 --> 02:58:44.896
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only did they make their $120,000 for the base game, but they made their first stretch goal of $130,000 meaning they're going to expand on the castle and add some rooms and puzzles 15% more game So, pretty cool Congratulations to the team there who make Shadowgate

02:58:46.277 --> 02:58:47.357
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's get to the Twitter topics.

02:58:48.318 --> 02:58:50.119
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really excited about that Shadowgate reboot, though.

02:58:50.239 --> 02:58:53.120
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually, that's only the second Kickstarter I've ever given to.

02:58:53.221 --> 02:58:55.002
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've done GamerCon, and I did that one.

02:58:55.962 --> 02:58:56.622
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see.

02:58:57.543 --> 02:59:05.788
[SPEAKER_04]: There's part of me that wants to give to the Molyneux project, but then I'm like, that guy is such a... The advertisement, again, really, really turned me off a little bit.

02:59:06.568 --> 02:59:06.848
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

02:59:08.289 --> 02:59:08.749
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

02:59:08.889 --> 02:59:11.049
[SPEAKER_04]: Going to some tweets.

02:59:13.650 --> 02:59:14.870
[SPEAKER_04]: Twitter.com slash OLR.

02:59:15.270 --> 02:59:20.532
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft wants to remind us the Gold Nunchuck will make its return to Club Nintendo tomorrow.

02:59:20.792 --> 02:59:23.532
[SPEAKER_04]: 900 points for the Golden Nunchuck because they need to get rid of him.

02:59:24.633 --> 02:59:26.093
[SPEAKER_10]: I really need this in my life, Rob.

02:59:26.393 --> 02:59:27.093
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't understand.

02:59:27.153 --> 02:59:27.973
[SPEAKER_04]: What, the Golden Nunchuck?

02:59:28.133 --> 02:59:28.334
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

02:59:28.554 --> 02:59:29.874
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

02:59:30.594 --> 02:59:34.155
[SPEAKER_10]: The Garrus figure that's... A Zekstal?

02:59:37.077 --> 02:59:37.517
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what?

02:59:37.817 --> 02:59:38.437
[SPEAKER_03]: A sex doll.

02:59:38.898 --> 02:59:39.218
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

02:59:40.478 --> 02:59:43.500
[SPEAKER_10]: It's someone linked it to me for cheaper.

02:59:47.141 --> 02:59:47.562
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:59:47.842 --> 02:59:48.922
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's see.

02:59:49.042 --> 02:59:53.324
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on to the next tweet from Tiger Claw.

02:59:53.825 --> 02:59:54.865
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I did read about this.

02:59:56.326 --> 03:00:00.287
[SPEAKER_04]: 007 Legends Studio Eurocom laid off a big chunk of its staff this week.

03:00:01.028 --> 03:00:03.229
[SPEAKER_04]: And he links us to a story I'm trying to bring up right now.

03:00:04.910 --> 03:00:12.077
[SPEAKER_04]: The Eurocom Studio, which is based in the UK, laid off the majority of its workforce as part of restructuring.

03:00:12.377 --> 03:00:13.558
[SPEAKER_04]: The studio has been around since 88.

03:00:13.978 --> 03:00:16.421
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they made a lot of games besides just this.

03:00:16.561 --> 03:00:22.146
[SPEAKER_04]: They also did 007 Reloaded and then, of course, Legends, which wasn't very well received, unfortunately.

03:00:23.066 --> 03:00:31.788
[SPEAKER_04]: Eurocom director Hugh Binns said that, quote, Eurocom are undertaking a restructuring which I regret to say has meant we've made the majority of our workforce redundant today.

03:00:31.848 --> 03:00:33.348
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the British word for laying off.

03:00:34.369 --> 03:00:41.290
[SPEAKER_04]: This includes many very experienced, talented, and highly skilled employees, and we'd like to thank them all for your hard work and efforts.

03:00:41.790 --> 03:00:44.511
[SPEAKER_04]: And they say this is because of the decline in the video game market.

03:00:45.271 --> 03:00:47.192
[SPEAKER_04]: The studio had to cancel a number of projects.

03:00:47.992 --> 03:00:49.072
[SPEAKER_04]: That sucks.

03:00:50.714 --> 03:00:58.437
[SPEAKER_04]: And lastly, SSJ100 Matt sends us this tweet about, we all know playing games while driving is a terrible idea, but one game is trying to change that.

03:01:00.918 --> 03:01:01.959
[SPEAKER_04]: Bright Driver.

03:01:02.822 --> 03:01:03.462
[SPEAKER_04]: is what it's called.

03:01:03.522 --> 03:01:05.203
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an iPhone app called Bright Driver.

03:01:05.303 --> 03:01:12.706
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a platform that supports audio games people play in the car to keep their attention from lagging during long rides.

03:01:13.206 --> 03:01:23.949
[SPEAKER_04]: It uses GPS functionality to keep track of the user's driving using metrics like speed, break rate, and stressful conditions like traffic and the games modify their pace appropriately.

03:01:24.370 --> 03:01:25.470
[SPEAKER_04]: That is crazy.

03:01:26.430 --> 03:01:27.271
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of cool.

03:01:27.751 --> 03:01:29.812
[SPEAKER_04]: Like an audio game that you interact with.

03:01:30.552 --> 03:01:30.792
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

03:01:31.372 --> 03:01:32.432
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to hear more about this.

03:01:32.452 --> 03:01:35.353
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to read the rest of the story for a future week, but that sounds kind of cool.

03:01:36.614 --> 03:01:40.315
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's it for the tweets tonight at twitter.com slash OLR.

03:01:40.715 --> 03:01:43.856
[SPEAKER_04]: And this means we're at the end of the show.

03:01:44.656 --> 03:01:44.797
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw.

03:01:45.997 --> 03:01:48.358
[SPEAKER_04]: Rachel, thank you very much for coming to the show tonight.

03:01:48.778 --> 03:01:49.518
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for having me.

03:01:49.558 --> 03:01:50.118
[SPEAKER_04]: And sitting in.

03:01:50.158 --> 03:01:50.919
[SPEAKER_04]: Come back anytime.

03:01:51.579 --> 03:01:52.099
[SPEAKER_04]: I surely will.

03:01:52.359 --> 03:01:54.060
[SPEAKER_04]: and we'll talk to you again.

03:01:55.240 --> 03:01:59.803
[SPEAKER_04]: It may have taken you 480 episodes to get here but it doesn't look like we're going to go anywhere anytime soon.

03:01:59.843 --> 03:02:02.984
[SPEAKER_04]: Duke Nukem told us we need to keep listening so I guess we're here for a little while.

03:02:03.945 --> 03:02:05.465
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?

03:02:10.548 --> 03:02:11.588
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

03:02:11.788 --> 03:02:12.189
[SPEAKER_12]: Quick plug?

03:02:12.629 --> 03:02:13.189
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, of course.

03:02:13.409 --> 03:02:14.990
[SPEAKER_12]: Greetings from the wasteland at WordPress.

03:02:15.210 --> 03:02:19.052
[SPEAKER_12]: I do creepypasta and I do write about video games occasionally.

03:02:19.397 --> 03:02:19.697
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura

03:02:37.506 --> 03:02:39.226
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone really needs to get me the Garrus figure.

03:02:39.406 --> 03:02:40.367
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not even kidding.

03:02:40.887 --> 03:02:43.547
[SPEAKER_10]: Does it come with full release?

03:02:43.587 --> 03:02:45.808
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it come with Tumblr rendered VJ?

03:02:45.848 --> 03:02:46.648
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

03:02:47.168 --> 03:02:51.889
[SPEAKER_04]: And my final thought tonight, as always, thank you all for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

03:02:52.249 --> 03:02:55.530
[SPEAKER_04]: If you enjoyed the show, please tell a friend or two or 20 about the show.

03:02:55.890 --> 03:02:58.790
[SPEAKER_04]: Help us spread the word because we don't have any major websites behind us.

03:02:59.171 --> 03:03:00.971
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we have the VOG Network, but let's be...

03:03:01.491 --> 03:03:05.373
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's be real, it's not exactly a oneup.com or a giant bomb.

03:03:05.833 --> 03:03:07.494
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, help spread the word.

03:03:07.514 --> 03:03:08.714
[SPEAKER_03]: A website that generates revenue.

03:03:08.814 --> 03:03:09.955
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, exactly.

03:03:10.255 --> 03:03:11.215
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a fun project.

03:03:11.255 --> 03:03:11.675
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know what?

03:03:11.695 --> 03:03:13.996
[SPEAKER_04]: There are more great shows on VOG.

03:03:14.036 --> 03:03:14.857
[SPEAKER_04]: It is not just us.

03:03:15.197 --> 03:03:16.998
[SPEAKER_04]: There are lots and lots of great shows on VOG.

03:03:18.018 --> 03:03:20.039
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobby Blackwolf before us Sunday nights.

03:03:21.099 --> 03:03:22.660
[SPEAKER_04]: Under Station Live on Saturday nights.

03:03:23.420 --> 03:03:26.882
[SPEAKER_04]: Mondays are full of pod culture, British invaders, and critical myth.

03:03:27.222 --> 03:03:30.563
[SPEAKER_04]: Critical Myth, the hardworking guys, they're on three times a week on the network.

03:03:30.963 --> 03:03:32.483
[SPEAKER_04]: Anime Jam Session on Tuesday.

03:03:33.243 --> 03:03:34.824
[SPEAKER_04]: Girls Gone Wow on Wednesday.

03:03:35.164 --> 03:03:36.524
[SPEAKER_04]: And Horde House, they're okay.

03:03:37.084 --> 03:03:38.025
[SPEAKER_04]: Also on Wednesday.

03:03:39.165 --> 03:03:39.785
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.

03:03:39.825 --> 03:03:43.266
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, as Black Wolf says in chat, VOG Network, it's a website.

03:03:45.106 --> 03:03:46.026
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good final thought.

03:03:46.346 --> 03:03:47.087
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a website.

03:03:48.067 --> 03:03:50.727
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see you next time on our website.

03:03:51.548 --> 03:03:52.348
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good night, everybody.

03:03:52.768 --> 03:03:53.048
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

03:03:54.116 --> 03:03:57.138
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

03:03:57.778 --> 03:04:02.001
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.

03:04:02.582 --> 03:04:11.448

03:04:12.088 --> 03:04:23.516
