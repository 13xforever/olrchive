Orange Lounge Radio
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice
It is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 481 for this November the 11th of 2012
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and all that good stuff
With my co-hosts, first off, the one, the only, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers
Hi
How are you, Jamie Summers?
Um, I'm okay
Your knitting rainbow things over here are crocheting
I'm crocheting the gayest scarf ever, all it needs is KY jelly and it'll be gayer
Are you planning in advance of Gay Pride Month? Are you planning to sell these?
No, this is actually, it's a scheme that I've had for a while and I thought was kind of a different bit of yarn
But, um, I've been taking orders for scrap scarves
Basically I'm working through all of my old cheap yarn
And this was actually a fairly cheap scheme, I just didn't realize that it was going to crochet up so pretty
So I'm actually going to go back and buy more of them to make people scarves and things for various pride events and whatnots
Or like the holidays? Because, you know, everybody likes a homemade holiday gift, I do
Well, that's actually why I texted you a while back and asked if you or Alan were allergic to wool
Yay! Awesome
Because I'm broke
Well, also say hello to somebody that I'm sure is making lots of homemade gifts for the holiday, Techmaster Loki
Um, no, I'm not
You're not going to bake cookies for everybody for the holidays?
No, I don't do much baking
Well, how have you-
Let's order some cookies from Colorado
Right? How have you been doing, Loki?
Oh, fantastic with my car not working and everything
Oh, yeah, sorry to hear about that
Yeah, it was the Ford we expect
Fix or repair daily, right?
Yeah
Well, it's not just the three of us on the show every week, it's you guys joining us live in our chat room
If you want to join us in the chat room, head on over to live.vognetwork.com
And if you're listening on the podcast feed, just a reminder, we do tape live every Sunday night at about 6 o'clock Pacific, 9 o'clock Eastern
Right after the Bobby Black Wolf show at the Voice of Geeks Network or vognetwork.com
And again, our chat room live.vognetwork.com
You know, there is another thing that Ford can stand for
What?
Found on Road Dead
Yeah, I've heard that one too
From a parking lot
But it doesn't work
Yeah
Alright, so we're going to get into some news and what we've been playing this week
And some big interviews tonight that I will talk about in just a moment
But I do want to start off the show first because we have some interviews tonight
I know we might have a few new listeners because of that
I want to say hello, welcome to the show
Reintroduce ourselves a little bit
We try to do that once every few months or so for those folks that are new to Orange Lounge Radio
But if you are new to Orange Lounge Radio, hello
We're a show, we created this show, myself, Dark Soccer and Loki all created this show
Ten years ago, over ten years ago
We all met playing a little game you might have heard of in the arcades
Stomping arrows called Dance Dance Revolution
And we used to play that pretty aggressively here in the south
I don't know what other words you used to describe it
We were angry DDR players
Damn these arrows, damn them
And birthday parties
At Roseville Golf Land where we sat on the floor in front of the fourth mix and ate cake
That was my birthday
I still remember one of the first dream games we ever had on Orange Lounge Radio
Was inspired by Golf Land trips
You called it birthday party sniper
Something like that
Yeah, Roseville Golf Land is an interesting place
It still is today, interesting is a good word to describe it
Like people who pick their nose and eat it
It's interesting
I went not too long ago and wore myself out by DDR
I was like, I got old
I know right
But anyway, ten years ago we all met playing DDR
And we were really into that scene
It wasn't just DDR
It was a lot of the imports coming from Japan
We used to have the Bamani parties here locally
The sacramentals having the Bamani parties
Where we'd bust out the Beatmania 5 key, the Beatmania 2DX
Guitar freaks
I remember I couldn't get that name because a Catholic organization took it
Really?
Yeah
I forgot about that
Well anyway
So we decided to make this little show
Because I have some prior radio experience dating back to college
And another show I was on many years ago called Undersedation Live
And myself, Dark Soccer, and Loki after a long day at the arcade
No matter what we were playing at the time
Whether it be DDR, Initial D, or something like that
We used to go to a little restaurant that was in the parking lot
And we'd just kind of sit around, order things that were bad for us
Like mozzarella sticks
And just talk some shit about video games
And what was going on
And so that was really the type of thing we wanted to bring here to the internets
Is this giant virtual table
Where we're all sitting on one side of it here in the studio
Talking our stuff
And then you guys kind of make up the rest of that table
Sitting here with us in the chat room
And via the Skype line and so forth
Just talking some good stuff about video games
And just having fun with it
Because that's what video games are all about
Fun and
Talking smack about stupid people
DDR and that whole thing and Beatmania
Bimani in general
Music games was really all about community
So segueing a little bit into
One of the interviews we're going to have tonight
Is with our buddy Eddie
He runs a website you might have heard of
If you've played music games before
It's called BimaniStyle.com
And that site's been around a very long time
In fact I think it's older than us
By a few months
So we're going to talk to Eddie tonight
About community
Because he has
Especially now that DDR Freak is sunsetted
It's no more
He probably has the largest music game community that's out there
So I want to talk to him just kind of about
The past
The future
And so forth
And have some fun commentary with him on that
So we'll be talking to him in about 15 minutes or so
Also on tonight's show
We have another interview
A taped interview we're going to play tonight during our break
Where the music usually is
This is something that DJ Rama S did for us
And I'll talk more about this
This whole
That we have other people doing interviews
I'll talk more about that later
But this is an exciting interview
It's Jen
From a website called Girl Gamer Vogue
GG Vogue.com
She's going to talk about
Her girl gaming community
In the tri-state area back east
And why she made it
And what it's all about
So we're going to have that a little later on in the show
Probably closer to about 8 o'clock
Before we get to the interviews and so forth
We're going to get into our gaming weeks
But I want to talk
A little bit here
At the top of the show about something personal
Because we did talk about
The shows are all about community
And over these 10 years that we've been doing this show
We have a lot of the same people that show up in our chat room week after week
And they like to hear the little insights that are going on in our personal lives
Both the good and the bad
And I have to share something with you guys tonight
That kind of happened
I just want to get off my chest
Because the weird thing about this is
And I'm going to apologize to Jamie in advance for this
Because a lot of this is very deja vu
To a story that she told
Not even three weeks ago
Perfectly okay
Just forgive me if I get sniffy
It's fine
The whole thing's just weird
So you guys can probably guess where I'm going with this
If I'm referencing that
As many of you know
I moved in with my boyfriend Allen
About, gosh it was probably about
Almost two years ago now
And we
Actually more like a year and a half
But anyway
He brought with him two cats that he's had for a long time
Since 2000 I think
I think he got them around October of 2000
And they were about four or six months old at the time
Probably fudging some of these details
But I wasn't around back then
And their names are
Maruko and Sanrio
And Maruko was a male black cat
And Sanrio's a tan cat
Female
And you know I've grown very close to these cats as well
And you've probably heard them referenced on the show sometimes
In fact it was really weird
Just the other day
I was listening to a playback
Yes I do listen to OLR once in a while
It's a really good way to kind of be a
Critic of yourself
I was listening to the show a couple weeks ago
And I believe Maruko came out
Because I heard Jamie like
Oh hey Maruko like you were petting him
They were very unlike Shirmi
Where they don't come out during the shows
Because they're very shy
And they don't like people
She was like already there you can't move her
This is my couch
You don't like it get out
Maruko always pranced around with his tail in the air
So I always called him Mr. Priss
But he was also very vocal
And was a really fun cat
And I really have grown to appreciate Maruko
And he loves Sanrio's food
No doubt
You can sadly guess where this is going
We got blindsided a little bit
The past couple days
Maruko started showing some really bad symptoms
On Thursday and Friday
He just wasn't himself
I can't even describe it
His meows were different
He was always a very vocal cat
The way he was breathing was very different as well
So I told Alan well of course let's go see the vet
Right away
We got to the vet's office pretty much thinking
Oh you know we just need to get some medication
He'll be alright whatever
But we get the x-rays back and the news is really bad
He had a lot of fluid in his body
In places it shouldn't be
Basically so much around his lung
That it was basically pushing on his lung
And he was having a hard time breathing
That was causing it
Unfortunately
A tough decision had to be made
And we put him down yesterday
And it was
What can I say?
It was devastating
Just the shock of it all
Just the fact that this came out
Of literally nowhere
Even though this thing that he'd been developing
Apparently was silently developing for years
But even if we had
The thousands of dollars to pursue
A diagnosis and figure out
What was causing it
The veterinarian made it pretty clear that
It's probably heart failure
It's probably cancer
I have another friend that just lost a cat to FIP
Not that long ago
So it's just like
It's tough
With Shermy she was wheezing
When we got back from Disneyland
And then I wrapped her up in hot towels
For a few days
And she perked right back up
And then suddenly she just
Keeled over
But the symptoms sound very serious
And it's just like
It's just like
But the symptoms sound very serious
She was having respiratory issues
Since some folks in the chat room
Are asking at live.vognetwork.com
The Maruko was 12 and a half
So a little old
In kitty ears
For an indoor cat
Maybe not super old
But definitely old enough
For complications to start coming in
So I don't know what else to say
I just want to get that off my chest
So that way if I'm gonna sniffle up
And not while we're trying to interview somebody
Hi Eddie how are you?
He was a very good kitty
And he sat in my lap a couple times
Well you used to cat sit
So I know you were one of the first people I called in the parking lot
And I was like
I'm driving
I was actually literally
This was at what Florin Mall used to be
If you want to know where I was
And I was having the thing to pull out
Into the street when you called
And I was trying to be considerate
And I was like okay fine
And then it went on to FaceTime
I was like oh shit have I been on FaceTime this entire time
And turn around and pull in
And I had my friend with me
And then I just did a circle in the parking lot
Anyway I want to try and move on
I don't want to dwell on this too much
But I do want to address
Some of the comments that are in chatroom
At live.vognetwork.com
Lots of condolences and thank you very much
I will pass those along to Alan as well
I was only fortunate enough to know Maruko for about 3 years
But he did live for 12 and a half
Tigerclaw says my condolences
Losing a pet is the hardest thing a person could ever go through
It is definitely one of the worst
Tigerclaw asks how about Sanrio
How is she health wise
Obviously the plan is
When we have money
Because yesterday set us back a little bit
But when we have some money we do want to go in and get her checked
And make sure she didn't contract the same virus
That's one of the first things we want to try and rule out
She's doing okay
She's hard to read right now
I think she knows something's up
She's kind of looking around
Acting a little differently
I think she knows something's missing
But that's to be expected
But she still has some of her playfulness
I took a really cute video earlier today
Of her playing with a string
So you know
We'll see
We'll try to get her in as soon as we can
When we can financially
Take care of it
Going to some other comments in our chatroom
I like this from Breakman it's very good
Cats and dogs are such a great part of our life
But they are so fragile
And their time with us is far too short
Ain't that the truth
Gamegrew says I'm sorry about your cat
I've lost my last cat a few months ago
It's tough
And especially
The suddenness of it all
Is tough
I want to move on
How do we escape from reality
By playing video games
Well not in my case I drank and cried
For a night
We haven't quite had that phase
Yet and I'm hoping we'll be alright
But if we have to have that we will
Sometimes it doesn't hit you
For a little while
Let's talk about video games and some of the other
Distractions and things that are better
And again if you do want to join us in our chatroom
Live.vognetwork.com is the place
To be
DarkSagra why don't you start us off tonight
I have a very happy announcement of something
That I've played
Mass Effect 3
What a shock
The ghost patch
Is what we're calling it
Because I just decided on a whim
To check on it after a fresh boot
And it patched something
And I'm like really?
And so I loaded it and of course it rewrote
My hack file which is fine
And I
I loaded it up
And lo and behold I had zero
Problems none of the lag none of any of that
So I was
Quite happily surprised
And I
Even checked it
You know with other people
I you know did a bunch of
Other stuff to make sure it wasn't just a
A
You know
What's the word I'm thinking of?
Not a whim
But just a one off
Thing and
It kept working and so I was like
Everyone get a multiplayer right now
So I played for a while with
Shane and Tim
And then I played again
With Shane and
Tim and Spike the other day
And with my friend George
And everything was fine I still kind of suck at it
But I'm getting better and
Got a few levels in did the N7
Challenge thing
Fun so you got a banner
And I wore my N7 shirt
That day and
I also went in just to
See if it was like a completely new patch
So I tried to um to hack my game
Again and well more like
Hex edit it so that I could get the console to
Unlock and the same it's at
The same sector it still works so
But everyone if you're trying to do
The hex edit based on what's on
The mass effect wiki it's
Not F4 for the last two
Numbers it's F3 just letting
You know I
Did that on screw that up no I did it
Because there's no F4 I did
I did the F3 on a win because I found the
Same sector and it worked so
They have it on there wrong
So um as
I just said Tigerclaw um probably
Didn't hear but I can play online again
And I went back in on my DLC
Works and so that means I'm good
To go for Omega but we're calling
It the ghost patch because
They didn't announce anything
They didn't even acknowledge that there
Was a problem the only acknowledgement
That I got was from
Some guy
In customer service
Who actually worked with me for a long time
And he said yeah we're noticing that there's
A problem here we just can't say anything else about it
Right now oh really
I can't say
No comment I can't
Say anything on that he was
He did more for me than the other people
Did but
It did give me a nice little
30%
Off code which I'm going to use for the Omega
DLC
So I'm very happy
And um I played
Through Mass Effect 2 I actually did
Touch WoW long enough to
Log out while I was trying to make
Plans with you to go see Silent Hill
I completely forgot that I was logged in and
Talking to you
Did you guys go see Silent Hill? No we still haven't made it out
To see it
You need to do that
BlackWolf has a smart ass comment
In our chat room at live.vognetwork.com
In response to your fact
That the information on the wiki is wrong
He says if only it was a wiki
And everyone could edit it
That means I have to log in for an account on it and I don't
Fucking feel like it
That means I have to do work
Well the other thing
And I think I mentioned it last week is now that I have a job
Like a real job
That's going to pay me some good money
Hooray for money
That I kind of haven't had much
Garris
I haven't had a whole bunch of time
To really do much except
That the good thing about my job is that since I don't usually have to
Be in until 9 in the morning
I can stay up till midnight and sleep in
And so I can actually
Because who really feels like
Waking up early in the morning and gaming
Before work? Seriously?
Gaming is something you stay up all night
And do. You play games in the morning, Logie?
I would if I didn't have to get
The baby up
I like to stay up all night
I don't have children, that's awesome
I've stayed up all night and done that still
He's not really a baby anymore either
He's more of a toddler
Just saying
At any rate
At any rate
My schedule has actually been pretty perfect
For gaming except that
My work environment is so fast paced
And I don't get paid days off which makes me a little sad
But it's all good
That's my work
It's in a small office in a house
And I have so much freedom
For my scheduling and for things that need to happen
And I can wear socks
I ask permission to wear my fuzzy socks in the office
And I can do it
It's great. Anyways
My work allows me more game time
So I will be playing more stuff
Awesome. Logie, how was your gaming week?
I played Call of Duty Black Ops 2
Yes, I know it's not out yet
How's that gonna stop me?
When you work in games distribution
You can sometimes
You know, do things early
Anyways, so, got the play
Obviously haven't been playing any multiplayer
On it, well, no
Internet multiplayer because the servers aren't up
And also you want to be careful
Because everyone, after the whole Halo leaking out a month
Early and stuff like that
So
Been playing mainly the single player campaign
And really that's kind of cool
Because I haven't played a lot
Of the single player campaigns
I played a bit of Modern Warfare 3 single player campaign
And totally hated it
Because they were
Really penalizing you with shooting your teammates
Not that I'm trying to shoot my teammates
But everyone kind of blends in
When it's so chaotic and stuff
And it seems like Black Ops 2 isn't so
At least
I'm playing on a super easy difficulty too
Because I just really care about the story
I don't give a shit about the challenge
But
You know, I haven't had that problem
Where, oh, you accidentally killed a teammate
Because, you know, he ran in front of you
When you're firing a missile or something like that
You know, so that's kind of cool
But the story is fucking awesome
It's just like, it's really action packed
And just, I really enjoy it
And that's saying a lot
Considering that a lot of times
People consider the, like, single player
Campaign for these kind of games
To be kind of just a throw away
It's just, oh, well they have it on there
Actually, the single player is pretty awesome
Like, and I actually want to check out
The first Black Ops game
Because I never played it
But, you know, obviously carrying on with the characters
That they have from the first game
But it just, like, for example
There's one scene, it kind of flips back and forth
Between the past and the future
Warfare
So, the first kind of future warfare
One that you're in, you're kind of swinging along
This, it's like a mountainside
Or something like that
And you're tethered to this other guy
And you have these nanogloves that you can grip onto the rocks and stuff
And they're scouting out this
This base that's, you know, kind of in a temple
Or something like that
And so, they put on their wingsuits
And they fly down there
And just that sequence is so fucking awesome
It's just, like, I saw them
It's like, this is so awesome
Does it have, like, 80's metal playing in the background?
No, there's no 80's metal playing
It's very, like, cinematic
Because, uh, Knight, was it Trent Reznor
Oh, that's right!
It's just really awesome
Like, you're flying down there
And I know it's not really, like, a quick time thing and stuff
I mean, there are some quick time stuff in there
But it wasn't that big a deal
But, um, it was just really cool
And then you get into this, like, secret thing under the base
And it's like, oh, it's this, you know, nanobot factory thing
That's pretty awesome
And then there's also the one that you've seen in the trailer
Where you're riding on a horseback
And it's one of the flashback missions that you're on
But you're playing on a horseback
Like, almost the whole mission
And it's awesome, because you're just
Blowing up tanks with a rocket launcher on the back of a horse
And there's, like, helicopters flying over
Wait, say that again?
Blowing up tanks
You're blowing up tanks on the back of a horse
You're holding a rocket launcher and riding a horse
I swear to God, that was a scene in Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter
That was sort of a scene in the commercial
Except the girl had grenades
But it's just
It's so, like, chaotic and awesome
It's a really
I love it, I love the campaign
And it really kind of makes me want to go back and try some of the other
Single player campaigns of the different games
But just for some reason, this, like, kind of
Near future combat stuff is just really
Cool, like, the storyline's actually
I think really well done
So, um, definitely worth checking out
I mean, even if you're kind of thinking twice about
Eh, it's just another Modern Warfare shooter game
Check out the storyline
They actually did a pretty good job on it
So besides that, played a little bit more Minecraft
Been just trying to get, you know, plugins and stuff
To work correctly with each other
I'm working on finishing up the mob arena stuff
So I have this Magic Spells
Um, plugin that I added in there
But I didn't realize it had a dependent
Plugin with this vault thing that I had to install
In there, so I'm still trying to get that all worked out
And get the permissions set correctly
Still kind of new to the whole bucket plugin stuff
Um, and then I noticed that
One of our other users
Hitstun had turned in the Mr. Freeze
And had frozen the jungles
Everybody chill
Seriously
Wait a second, why can't I see off the roof of this
Mob arena I created
What's going on here, is it just not drawing in
I realize it's snow
Leave it to Hitstun or somebody to bring
The League of Super-Villains into the
It was an accident
He was working with World Edit
It's always an accident
That's how villains get created
Hey, it was easy to fix
Joker fell into that vat
This is what happens when you play God
And it was fixed
He was making a snow globe
In the nether
I don't know how that
Got out onto everything else
But there's snow in a bunch of the
Different chunks there
So I had to fix that
I thought it was hilarious, there was snow in the jungle
Yes, there was snow all over the jungle
I was like, this is not right
I had to find the corners and then
Welcome to the jungle, we got lots of snow
So I fixed all that
I tried playing a little bit of Curiosity
But it wasn't working
So that was that
And Call of Duty Black Ops
Or not Black Ops, Modern Warfare 3
We've been playing multiplayer of that
And that's pretty fun
I actually played a little bit of multiplayer in Black Ops 2 as well
The split screen stuff
Actually the split screen stuff
Because I was bored, I decided to take on
Nine AI characters that were the
Veteran difficulty, which is the hardest
Because it's AI
And you figure out the weaknesses in their
Pathfinding and away you go
So that was that
I forgot one other game I played
Very Solitaire
That's right because it was free, I played that too
It was actually fun
For a free game, better than Yaris
It was a good time killer
I actually had fun with it because I like card games
Yeah
It reminded me of Neopets
I wouldn't have minded paying a little bit of money for it
But it was cute
I used to play Pyramid Solitaire on Neopets all the time
That was a good tip Act F by the way last week
Oh and the last thing, one of the things that they've been hyping up
About Black Ops 2 is these whole
This kind of like strike force missions
They fucking suck
I hate the strike force missions
And the reason why is because they're on the multiplayer maps
It's basically kind of like this strategy thing
Where you get a bunch of different troops and stuff
And you can kind of, okay go here defend this
Go here attack this
And you can jump into each of them
It's supposed to add this kind of strategy element to it
The problem is though
Is the controlling of that stuff is really terrible
And so you're telling your troops to go here
And then you're trying to select one soldier
And it's selecting all of them
It's pain in the ass
I found it more efficient for me to go into a soldier
And just do the mission myself
So that's kind of the only
Poopoo thing about Black Ops 2 right now
Halo Man in our chat room
At live.vognetwork.com says
Today's headline, Loki loves a game
The Mayans have been proven to be right
Dude I love games all the time
Grand Theft Auto
Hello
By the way Halo 4 made me nauseous
If you're done with your gaming week
I want to quickly talk about mine
I don't have a whole lot of time
Because we're running a little late for Eddie's interview
Because we got a late start tonight
But I want to quickly talk about
A couple games because I did play some new stuff this week
One of them is Halo 4
Yes, me
Halo, uh huh, I bought it
Keep in mind
I've been out of the Halo franchise for a little bit
I didn't buy ODST, I didn't buy Anniversary
I didn't buy Reach, the last Halo game I bought was Halo 3
And I didn't love Halo 3
Because I didn't have a lot of friends
That were online playing the multiplayer
And for me that's kind of where it's at in Halo
I don't get into the story mode too much
So Halo 4
Is kind of a new boot to the series
Because it's a new developer
It's 343 Industries
I'm only through like the first two chapters
So I'm not going to try to speak with authority or anything
But I will say
It's interesting
I feel a little lost
Because I'm not as familiar with all the backstory
And so forth
But I can pick up enough of what's going on
That I'm not like hating it
And at the end of the day
The story is really about the relationship between
Master Chief and Cortana
Any review outlet that's talked about this game
Is going to tell you that
There's too much more to really get into the series
But for me
It's always been multiplayer
Is where it's at
And I've been having fun
There's a group of about four of us that have been playing multiplayer online
And we've been trying out all the modes
You know, King of the Hill, Oddball
All the stuff you know from the old games
Of course Slayer
But there's a couple fun new ones
And I gotta say
I had a great time playing Flood
Which is one of the new game modes
Flood, some of you are the Spartans
Like the normal guys
But some of you become the Flood
You become these like creatures that run really fast
And have swords
And basically it is a
Kill the Spartans as fast as you can
And then once you kill a Spartan
They become a Flood
So it's kind of one of those like devour
You know everybody as fast as you can
And convert them and whoever can survive the longest
Ultimately wins
But for some random ass reason
The creatures make horsey noises
Like they go
They make these noises like horses
When they're dying and stuff
It's the creepiest thing in the world
And hilarious
So for a good time
Just add Flood
And then there was this other mode we played
I think it was like Griffonball or something like that
Griffball
All the other ones have description
And for Griffball it said
Just add awesome
Something like that
So we go in this mode and all it is
Is you have the gigantic gravity hammers
You can either have a hammer
Or a sword
And it's just a game of
Get the ball into the goal
But you have these giant hammers
That you're either knocking the ball around with
Or the other players
And so that shit was really funny actually
Even though we got beat bad
Like it was Shane and I
Versus Spike
And Tim
It was two on two
They wiped the floor with us
Like five points to nothing
It was depressing
But yeah that was a good time
I enjoyed myself
So if multiplayer is where Halo is at for you
Then you're definitely going to enjoy
Halo 4 I think
The graphics are a step up
It's just fun again
But keep in mind I've been away from Halo
For a good three years
I'm sure the story mode is great too
You know
Everybody says great things about it on the internet
But I'm not as into the lore and all that stuff
So I'm like okay yeah
The presentation is really good
There's a pretty cool scene in the beginning
Where you're climbing up a wall and it's kind of neat
The other game I want to talk quickly about
Little Big Planet Karting I picked up on the PlayStation 3
I haven't played a lot of it
Because I've been too busy with multiplayer on Halo 4
But I like it
It really does feel like a fusion
Of ModNation Racers
And Little Big Planet
Which is to obviously no one's surprise
Because it's the same developers of ModNation Racers
With all the Little Big Planet stuff in it
It controls great
It's fun
I noticed there weren't a lot of people online to race against
I'm not sure what's up with that
Maybe because the game is so new and everybody is distracted with Halo 4
I was just on at a weird time
But yeah
So far I'm liking Little Big Planet Karting
But I need more time with it
To give you my full opinions
The other games I'll talk about real quick
Curiosity What's in the Cube
I don't think that's really a game
We shouldn't call it a game
It's just a weird thing
They're having those server problems left and right
Which is really unfortunate
But I like the zenness
Of being able to just sit there and
Pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop
And kind of figure out the way to get
Huge combos of coins and so forth
I was able to get enough coins
You can buy items that will let you break bricks faster
See that was a thing the shop wouldn't even open up for me
Because it was so lagged out
I got this pick
That let you do 3x3
Bricks when you would tap
And you can rack up your combos so much faster
When you do that
Doing the little random tappings are much more fruitful
When you do that so kind of neat
But anyway
Curiosity not really a game
And they're having a lot of server problems
But it's free
Bemani better than Yaris
Little bit
The one other thing I want to talk about
Since we are about to have a
Bemani-centric interview here in a minute
Reflectbeat is out on the
iOS systems now
And you can get that on iPad or iPhone
I've been playing a little bit of Reflectbeat on the iPad
I did not know much about this game honestly
I've been out of the loop of a lot of the Bemani stuff
So you know again
It's free you only get 3 songs
Because they're trying to sell you the song packs
But it was different
I want to try some like
Versus and try to like play against somebody
Because I think that would be where the game would
Because there's more of a versus element to it
Where if you hit certain notes
They'll actually bounce back to the other side
And the other player has to hit them so that's kind of neat
It was kind of fun
A little different
Alright anyhow
We are going to, I'm running a little late here
So I want to get this in here
An interview
And I'm so happy to welcome to the show
Eddie from BemaniStyle.com
A long running website about music gaming
And music game culture
I want to bring him on the line and talk to him about
What's going on in the music game world
Hey Eddie you there?
Yeah can you hear me?
Yeah we can hear you just fine, how you doing Eddie?
I'm doing alright
Thank you so much for coming on the show
It only took about 10 years right?
Just about yeah
We got an E3 and so forth
But just never really thought to get you on the show
Until now so welcome
Thanks I appreciate it
Alright well let's just
Let's start with some questions
If you guys have questions for Eddie I know we probably have some of the
BemaniStyle community listening tonight
And I know we have some long time fans of music gaming
Listening tonight
If you want to ask a question at live.bognetwork.com
Just pop into the chat room and ask away
We'll read some of the questions here
A little later
What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?
No no you have to ask him on topic
Not a six hour show
So Eddie tell us
A little bit about your website
Tell us about where BemaniStyle.com
Came from, how did it start?
Funny enough
It actually started
Kind of as a result of
DDR spot, I don't know if you guys remember that
Site or not but some of the old NorCal
Players started that up years ago
Kind of like a competitor to
DDRFreak and
Mike No
Was in Michigan for a tournament
Way back in like 2001
And we ran into each other
And got to talking and at the time it was like
Me, him
The owner of TeamGuilo.net
Which was a Canadian site and
A friend of mine from the New England
Area named Malcolm, we were all talking about making this
Just gigantic site
To cover all music games
Because as it had standed
DDR was being talked about
Like everyone was kind of ignoring the other games
And that wasn't really what I was jiving with personally
Because I liked the Five Key stuff a lot
And there was
A lot of ego that got in the way
From the other two sites
And nothing bad
It wasn't like we were fighting or anything
But there were a lot of arguments about the name and everything
So Malcolm and I just kind of splintered off
And decided to start BemaniStyle
You know, on our own
And it was an early effort by
Me, him, some guys from the Midwest
And a handful of people we knew in Japan
To just get more
You know, word out about the other series that people
Weren't playing at the time
You've been very successful with BemaniStyle.com
Because it's really evolved into a place now where
I know for a while you were doing
You were doing some type of record distribution
Or record stuff, right?
I'm still doing that actually
It was kind of like a weird situation
I did
Slakes CD in the US
Back in like 2006
And a year later we got in touch with
DJ Chucky and the guys from Groovy
About bringing them
Out to the US to play at Anime Central
And that kind of spiraled
Into us distributing their albums
In North America
More Japanese hardcore stuff
Not Bemani-centric
But ever since we did that we've had
M Project
DJ Chucky, No Chin, Groovy
Chorus K, Red Alice
Jackazid
Just a number of people have been featured in all these music games
Out to Chicago for the Anime Central
Show that we do every year
So that's kind of like where that project is
We're actually right now in the planning stages
For our 2013 show
So it's still going on
Awesome, so that's kind of the place to be as Anime Central
If you want to see some of these artists that kind of
Started in music games I guess
Or I guess maybe known over here
From that or whatever you want to say
Yeah, that's pretty much it
What do you think has kept Bemani Style
I mean, you know, we just saw DDR Freak
You know, you kind of mentioned that
Bemani Style kind of started as a
It was meant to be somewhat like DDR Freak
But more inclusive of the other music games
Well, obviously DDR Spot
And before they shut down a long time ago
DDR Freak just recently in the past year
Finally sunsetted and said
You know, party's over
How do you think Bemani Style
What's kept Bemani Style
Above that and
In light of these other sites sunsetting
Well, I mean, you know, one thing
When it comes to running a website
Ultimately if it closes that's the decision of the person
Who owns the website and quite frankly
You know, my feelings on it are
Even when I have my low points
Which, you know
Got us talking, what, a week ago
A Facebook post that I made about how
The community has been lately
Even when I've had my low points
I just look at it as though I've been doing this site for 10 years
How can you just walk away from something like that
Especially when people are still using it
So I think it's just a
There's a genuine interest from a lot of people
Who are really die hard fans for that
Information on, you know, the more
Global games, stuff that's not released over here
And then at the same time there are people who are more
Casual that are into maybe
Just the music and they like knowing when
New songs are coming out, they don't play the
Games, they just want to know about the music
I think it's a variety of things, but the community's kind of stuck with us
And I'm just really not
Ready to let it go, so
Just sticking with it as long as I can
Since you brought up Facebook
And all that, where is
The community at these days, you think
What is the music game community
It's split, it's kind of weird because
You kind of have splinter groups now
In regards to what games people are playing
And what mentalities everybody has
Konami
Has not really been doing a lot to help
The community over here in the US
They never really have
There have been attempts in the past
With Beatmania
And the home version DDR's that came out
Early on and DDR continuing on
For years, but ultimately
The hardcore fans
Kind of get the short
End of the stick in the sense that
They're very vocal about
What they want from the games and Konami
Has to kind of
Appease both the mainstream
And the hardcore fans
And I think they lean a little bit too much towards
The mainstream and not enough towards
The hardcore fans
So the hardcore fans have just kind of gotten
Sick of it, a lot of them
It's just like any other internet community
The more negative people
Tend to be the ones that stand out more
In conversation, as opposed to the people who are
Praising the work of the people making the games
Or whatever the subject matter is
So
On the outside it looks
As though the community has just
Degenerated to this massive
Negativity
They're just tired of not getting
Any of the games and being
Ignored and so on and so forth
So you run into situations like what's
Happening right now with the DJ Max
Community, who for the most part
Ever since Technica came out have just been
Growing at an exponential rate
And a lot of them are really fantastic people
But you'll see people that
Once anything goes wrong or something
Doesn't go their way
Everyone starts complaining
Or starts just outright
Talking shit about the company that makes the game
Not really looking at it from their perspective
But saying like, hey, this is what I want
Why aren't you doing what I want you to do
And so that tends to stand out over the people
Who are a little bit more
Positive and understanding about everything
So from the outside looking in
I think the music game community kind of comes off
As though it's not very
Welcoming as of late
And I've had my criticisms over
Just the general
Attitudes of people for a long time
I think there's still just a ton of love
For the games and the hardcore players
Are a little bit more vocal about
What they expect than the people who play them
A little bit more casually
Since you were talking about Konami
And kind of like the difficult position
They've been in for many years
Although I don't know, I kind of think that
All the United States progress
For DDR, anything they had going
For it kind of went away when
Redmond and Hawaii both went away
That was pretty much the end of that, right?
I wouldn't necessarily say that
I think that
From a player expectation
A lot of that went away because they lost that connection
I mean, when they were doing
The games in Redmond especially
The guys working on the games
Were fans of DDR
A lot of them were really old school
NorCal and SoCal players
So that connection to the community
Definitely went away and I think that caused
A lot of problems, but
I don't think that the momentum
Went away, so to speak
I think the momentum went away when
Konami wasn't really being as
Hands-on with certain projects
As they used to be
So you'd see things like the Wii games
Coming out, I think were a fantastic effort
I think they did a really good job with those
The Xbox and the PS3 versions were kind of
Whatever, the song lists weren't fantastic
But I mean, they were still very traditional
DDR games, so then you look at the arcade side of things
And
After not ever
Making an attempt in North America with the
Arcade releases
Before Extreme, I mean, there was
The original DDR 1.5 in the US
And then there was DDR USA
But honestly, neither of them were really
Valiant efforts on their behalf
They kind of ignored everything for a long time
And then the In the Groove thing happened
And there was a lot of just
I think a lot of people really resented
Them for that because they felt like
If you're not going to do anything, why are you taking away
Our only outlet for these games?
And then they did Supernova and Supernova 2
Which I personally think were great
And those two
Like those two games in particular I think were a really good
Effort on their behalf, but then X and X2
Came out and it was just letting the wrong
People handle the franchise
Handle the development of these cabinets
And do the release and everything
So we got kind of like a shoddy product
I mean, not even kind of a shoddy product
It was really a shoddy product
And a lot of people just
Kind of got fed up with it and walked away from it
And I mean, I want to clear this up too
In regards to the arcade stuff because I know a lot of people bring this up
But DDRX2
Kind of had the same problems as DDRX1
Did where they were
Lowering the cost of production
On the games and you could tell that
You know, the quality went down a lot
Especially in the dance pads and they made
A conscious effort to try
To fix the problems from X
To X2 because
Myself and some friends of mine were brought in
To consult with them specifically on the
Arcade release to make sure certain things were up to snuff
And when we had seen them
Everything was functioning
Perfectly fine and timing
Was fantastic and the games were actually really good quality
And X2 as a mix is like one of my favorites
In a long time and then
Somewhere between when we did our testing
Work with them and the actual release
Something changed and the
Final product that we got just ended up being this
Shoddy mess that, you know, constantly
Ends up in a state of disrepair and is almost
Unplayable
Let me go to the chat because there's quite a few comments
Going on in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com
First off, Shane Olinko
Is saying, we worked at Redwood City
Not Redmond, oops, my bad, sorry, I was thinking of the
Wrong video game company apparently, my bad, my bad
Mass effect on the brain?
Apparently, apparently
YYR saying, I still
Believe that Supernova happened because
In The Groove happened and a few folks agreeing
With him, what do you think?
I don't think that that's the case
At all actually, a lot of people
Look at that because of the timing
Of the whole thing, but
A lot of people also don't remember
What it was like when Extreme came out
And when Extreme was in testing
They had always been saying that
Extreme was kind of like a reboot for them
The whole, we're starting all over and
You know, kind of giving it a last hurrah
On that hardware, but I think a lot of what
Caused them to take a break for so long was
Just the rampant bootlegging of that game
Just all over the world, they were losing
So much money on it, so many potential sales
And a lot of time
Went into developing a little bit
More secure of a system
And in between
The period of time from Extreme to Supernova
They had released Dancing Stage Fusion
In the UK, which used kind of like the
Middleware hardware
It was the same hardware that Pop and Music
Used, so it was a PS2 based hardware
And it didn't use
Magic Gate Protection, but it was still pretty
Uncrackable, and finally
They settled on the hardware that was used
Which was basically a PS2 in a box
With an IO board that plugged into everything
And, you know, had its issues with
Hard drives dying and all that other crap
But I think a lot of the delay had more
To do with them just trying to get a lockdown
On the issues with all the bootlegging
Since we're talking about like
Reboots and all this stuff and where DDR
Is heading, you know, this news came up very
Recently, even after I asked you to come
On the show originally, that is that
There is this Dance Dance Revolution
Reboot that's location testing in Japan
Right now, what do you think about this?
Good idea for the series?
Bad idea? Not gonna go anywhere?
What do you think? Well, I think too many people are
Looking at it the wrong way. I mean, just because
They went back to naming it Dance Dance
Revolution doesn't necessarily mean it's a reboot
Um, you know
Pop and Music recently lost its
Numbering system. They dropped
The newest version is
Technically the 21st version, but there's no
21 anywhere on the banner
And Guitar Freaks and
Drum Mania are getting reset as
GITADORA, which is basically just like the
XG games in a shiny white cabinet
And no second player guitar on the Guitar Freaks
version. Are you saying that everything's going the way
Of Apple, where now it's the new DDR?
Uh, well
I think that's what people are gonna end up calling it
DDR 2013, which is
What people are calling it right now, but
I think that what they're doing is
They're actually kind of going the rock band model
With everything, and they're setting it up to be
A platform as opposed to being
Something that you get yearly upgrades
On. They have a new pricing
Model for the arcades in Japan that they just
Rolled out with the newest BeatMania, where
The arcades pay a subsidized rate
For the hardware and
The game itself, and then Konami
Kind of forces a profit share on the game
Through their Paselli and EMUsment networks
So every month the arcades
Give up a certain amount of their profits, but they're
Paying so much less for the game as a whole
And then throughout the course of the product's
Life, they'll upload a bunch of new
Songs and add some features
To the online network, do more unlock games
Or whatever the case may be, and they've already
Said that with the new DDR game, they've stated
That every
Six months or so, they're gonna push out
Another 30 or 40 songs and a UI
Update and possibly new features
And stuff, so I think that this is less
Of a reboot and more of a way to
Kind of
Restructure the way they do things
Based on how the arcade market
Has been declining everywhere
In the world, like it's like a conscious
Effort to try to do something that
Arcade operators can work with but doesn't
Leave them in the hole at the end of the day
So this is like
The 11th doctor of DDR
Kinda, sorta
It just sounds like they're forcing them basically to buy
An upgrade each year because it's being subsidized
Throughout the entire year, and with
The good faith that they're actually gonna put out
30 to 40 songs or whatever for the
Next update, which, let's be honest
Compared to what I've seen with the home
Releases and what they support DLC wise
That's
I'll be interested to see if they actually
Continue on with that after at least
One update
Honestly though, I don't think that that's gonna be the case
I don't think the CS games are at all
Indicative of what they're doing with the arcade stuff
Because they've been doing download content on the
Arcade games for a few versions now
2DX18 had
Like an add-on patch really really
Really late into its life with a bunch of
Ubeat and Reflectbeat songs on it and then
Linkle came out and Linkle had like 2 or 3
Song updates, so I don't think
That they're gonna give up on this
And you've gotta look at it from the perspective of
They're not really selling them upgrades anymore
It's
Cutting the cost of production and it's also
Cutting the cost of development on these titles
So there's no reason for them to not stick with it
Because it's constant profit
If people are continuing to play the
Games, then the operators are gonna
Stick with the service and they're gonna stay
Subscribed to the amusement network and everything
So it doesn't really benefit Konami at all
To not stick with it and at the same time
It costs them way less in development
To do something like this than it would for them
To crank out a new game every 8-12 months
Like they've done for the past 10 years
Of the series existence
How does something like that work though
For importers over in the US?
It's kind of left to be
Unsaid right now, I mean they haven't
They haven't been making any of the games really available
For a while, DDR was available
But it was available in such sketchy
Circumstances
You had to buy, for X and X2
You had to buy a new machine from Betzen
And then there were these crap machines that would break down
So you'd end up spending more money and repairing
The game than you would make back
And you would never pay off the machine
That happened to a lot of arcades out here
In regards to 2DX and Popin' Music
And Guitar Fricks and Drummania
UBeat and Reflectbeat don't even really exist
Over here outside of like
3 locations
One of them isn't even an arcade that have a UBeat machine
They've never been available
Out here as upgrade kits
Because historically there just wasn't a lot of interest
From the arcade operators
For it, like even when they did the location tests
For 2DX14
And they did the UBeat location tests down here in Southern California
So
For importers, it really
It's not
Changing the situation
For them at all
Because it's not like people have been importing the games for years anyway
I think the last one that was really readily imported
As like a legit game
Was maybe 2DX Red
And that was, I don't know, 2003, 2004
So
I don't think it's really going to affect them at all
At the same time though
I really can't get too much into it
But there is some stuff going on
In regards to Konami's American
Arcade operations
That I've, you know, become privy to
And it's not really so much of a guarantee
As much as it is
They're showing genuine interest in getting the stuff out here
Because round one
Which had just opened up its second location here in Southern California
The music games are actually
Like hand over fist making more money
Than any other arcade games in the location
This is including Redemption
So they've pretty much put a mandate out
That like all of their music games have to be up 100%
Of the time and if something goes down
It needs to be fixed like immediately
Even if the parts need to be ordered from Japan
And Konami's kind of latched on to this
And they've been shopping
They've been shopping the games around
There are arcade distributors out here
Nothing's, you know, set in stone
Or anything like that
But ever since they dropped the bets in as their lead distributor
They have been making attempts to try to find someone else out here
To handle the stuff
So it's really just kind of hard to say where it's going to go
At this point, you know
It's the state of the arcade industry
In North America
That nobody wants to take risks on anything
That's going to cost money
And I think that might end up hurting it more
Than Konami's unwillingness to release anything
Am I to infer from this a little bit
That maybe the, you know, we've talked about
Arcade, the arcade scene has been hurting
For such a long time here in the states
At least certainly the way we used to know it
Am I to infer from this that maybe music games
Are a way to get
Quote, quote, I'm using my quotey fingers
Real games back in the arcade
Well, you know, think back to 10 years ago
When DDR first started getting popular in the US
Arcades had been dead since
You know, Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter 2
So it's
I see it as a cycle
I see the whole arcade industry as a cycle
And not to deviate too much from the conversation
But, you know, the arcade industry
Just doesn't
A lot of the operators are old
Older guys, there's a handful of younger guys
Who have been starting up their own places
But a lot of arcade operators are older guys
That just don't want to take risks on stuff anymore
So redemption kind of rules
That's the king of the arcade space right now
Because that's what's making money
But there's a lot of laws that have been
Brought to light, not really
They're not actually laws, but there's a lot of laws that are being
Proposed right now to kind of kill the
Redemption market because it's essentially
Gambling for children
If something like that passes, it's going to
Cause a huge change in the arcade market
But, you know, there are certain
Things like, I listened to the last few episodes
And you guys are talking about Wreck-It Ralph
And I think
That the arcade industry as a whole
Missed its entire mark with that movie
I think that that would have been
A perfect chance for them to
Maybe appeal to Disney to do some more
Cross-promotion and get people out to their locations
And bring some life back to the arcades again
And nobody capitalized that at all
There's always a DVD release
Yeah, but, you know, it's still going to be limited
At that point, I think it's better to strike
When the iron's hot, I went to a movie
Theater up here to see it, and they had
Like two arcade games in the entire place
You'd think that a movie theater who's
Expected, and it's like the number one movie in America
Right now, like, wouldn't that get
You to go to your route operators
And be like, hey, get some more stuff in here right away
We've got some extra space for you, bring in
Like a Pac-Man or bring in a racing game
Or something like that
Or one of those Wreck-It Ralph cabinets that they made
You know, just for fun
They're limited, though, I think they only put out like 30 of them
Well, why? Why not make more?
It wouldn't be that expensive to set something up
I mean, if you can run the game on an iPad, then
Yeah, you know, it's a promotional thing
The game was free on iPad
I know you're big on Disney like all of us
But the thing about Electronica was that little arcade they had there
With all the perfect machines
Yeah, well
I still think Electronica kind of missed its point
A little bit, too
I mean, like, I'm really critical of the arcade industry
So I'm not really the right guy to talk about something like that
That's fine
You know, they
The thing with the Wreck-It Ralph machines is that
They're converted Donkey Kong cabinets
So it's not like there's like a
Pleather of those available for them to just
You know, fix up and clean up
And throw the game into
I'm sure they worked within their means to get that released
So, I mean, yeah, they could hobble
Something together and release it
But, you know, where I think they really missed the mark
And me and a friend of mine was talking about this at an arcade auction
Last week
Why didn't they make a game based on Sugar Rush?
How hard would it be to
Throw a skin on a racing game
And add in some of the features that were featured
In the movie that were kind of talked about with that game
And then push it out as an arcade game
Like, that's the missed
Cross-promotion opportunity of the year right there
You know, you market that in Japan
With AKB48 doing the soundtrack
And you're set
Well, it'd be the new maximum tune
I swear, I was listening to the end credits
Going, is that AKB48?
It is AKB48
Well, that was kind of big news in the J-pop community
Like, kind of how
Perfume being in Cars 2 was
You know, they kind of got a lot of people talking
I just think they're, I love the movie
It was fantastic, but I think the whole industry
Kind of missed a lot of points
All the cameos were fantastic
But I think, you know, people didn't really handle
The release of that movie properly
I don't think there was enough faith placed in it
I got just a couple more questions for you
And then I want to go to the chat to see if they have anything
I already see a few things popping up here
But I've been dying to ask you this for years
And this is a very controversial question
Within the community, but I have to know
What you think about this one being
You know, so vested in the community and so forth
So, and it's about Guitar Hero
Because, you know, and I know this is like
Hello five years ago, but
When this game took off, there was a lot of people
In the community, they thought
You know, Konami was robbed of Guitar Freaks
And Guitar Hero has just come in
And taken all the credit
We all remember that review that X-Play did
Of Beatmania that was ridiculous
Where they said it was ripping off Guitar Hero
And all that, do you think Guitar Hero
At the end of the day, was it a good thing?
Or was it a bad thing?
For American fans of Japanese music games?
I think Guitar Hero
Before Red Octane was purchased
By Activision was a fantastic thing
For the music game community in the US
When the game
Before the game was even announced
To the public, I got a chance
To see it
I was hooked up with the guys at Red Octane
They brought me in to see it like shortly after
In the Groove PS2 launch party
And I walked out of that
That viewing just completely blown away by it
Because it was
As far as a music game goes
In North America, it was exactly what it needed to be
Because it's got enough
There for both the hardcore player
Who wants to challenge
But it's got the music that the mainstream player
Can kind of latch onto
I still play rock band like crazy
So I think that it was a great thing
But I think once Activision took a hold of it
And then started milking the franchise
For everything it was worth
The eventual downfall of the whole
Band based music game
Like all together
I think that that was really kind of where they missed
Their mark and handled it
They didn't handle it right at all
But I think initially it was a great idea
And it's not really like Konami was robbed of it
They knew the game was coming out
And they made the conscious effort not to release it
And a lot of people don't remember this either
But back in 2000, Guitar Freaks was slated for release
In the US, I still have a receipt
Some here in all my random music game
Collectibles for a pre-order that I placed at
FYE in Cleveland, Ohio
Back in like, I want to say
March of 2000 for that game
And then it got cancelled like last minute
Well I remember playing the arcade version
All the time, the US releases
You know, and
What was it that someone was telling me
When I was still playing it
Oh yeah, I got my pre-order in
Basically what you were saying
But I remember when we got contacted
For them to do something for the local news
For Guitar Hero
At my house and they made me hide
My Guitar Freaks stuff
I think that's more of like a
Lawsuit issue than anything else
You know, Activision did kind of go
Not Activision, but Red Octane went around that whole issue
The right way
They worked with Konami to get the licensing cleared
For the release on that, unlike
Some previous music games have been done
So that's kind of weird to hear
Now I don't think Konami was really robbed of anything
I think that, you know, that was their fault
For not releasing the game when they had the opportunity
And really grabbing hold of that market early on
Absolutely
Especially if they were, if Red Octane was working with
Konami over the licensing then
They saw, they had their eyes open the whole time
Well yeah, and that's why Konami ended up
Producing the arcade cabinet
Part of the licensing agreement
That they had for that game
Was that Konami would take over the rights to produce
And, you know, build the arcade cabinets
For that title
Max Ninja in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com
Guitar Heroes 1, 2, and 3 are the best Guitar Hero games
After that, it just sucked
I wouldn't even really say
Guitar Hero 3 was that great
That was still never soft
It was better than any of their other offerings
But I still wouldn't say that it was like
The top tier of the franchise
It was definitely the cliff teetering game
Where it's like, oh, here we go, we're on our way down
Yeah, pretty much
I was gonna say, I wonder what part of the agreement
Between Activision and Konami
That they decided that they're gonna put out a really terrible
Music game called Rock Revolution
And then help the sales of Guitar Heroes
The stories I could tell you
That I've heard about that one
Cause I know guys that worked on that on both sides
In America and Japan
And the guys in America were like
Gung-ho, they wanted to make this
The best effort they ever possibly could have
And I don't know if you guys
Ever played the drum portion of that game
With the actual controller
But the drum controller that they made for Rock Revolution
Is the best
Retail drum controller
That comes packaged with one
Like it's better than the Guitar Hero
Drum controller, it's better than the Rock Band
Drum controller, it was awesome
But they produced so few of them
Like nobody really got a chance to get a hold of those
But one of the stories that I had heard about that game
Was that the guy who started that whole project
In Japan
Was actually doing it as like a quote unquote
Revenge project
Against the companies in America
That had put out these rock games
And I don't really know
What his meaning of revenge was
Like was it to release a really bad game
And punish the fans or was it like
To try to put something out that would
Take all the sales
That sounds like Wile E. Coyote kind of revenge
Where he builds the elaborate
Trap only to have a blow up in his face
Pretty much
We obviously
Would not be able to get through an interview with you
Without talking at least a little bit about
DJ Max
I have loved music games
For a very long time
When OLR went through
It's creative shift a few years ago
We kind of opened ourselves up to the different types of games
I have not been following the DJ Max
News as rabidly as I was
The earlier Konami series
Although when I saw
The Technica machine in the arcade
I thought it was a good time
And I know there's a lot of stuff that they've been trying to do
With the Vita and so forth
What do you think maybe an old school music game fan
Like me who's kind of turned away
From that scene a little bit
What do you think
Maybe I should be looking at in
DJ Max? Why should I maybe come back and
Give DJ Max a look?
Well it depends on which one you're going to play
If you're going to play Technica
Then that's kind of like a whole different can of worms
Than if you're going to play the portable games
Which obviously would take a little bit of
Importing and dusting off your PSP
I think with DJ Max
As a franchise
There's a lot of people out there that know that I work for Pentavision
So I don't want anyone to think that this is like a
Company shill kind of thing here
My attraction to the DJ Max franchise
Is kind of the same attraction that I have
To Konami's Bimani games
And that's the music that they use
In the game
It's a lot of original producers
Producing stuff under different genres
And there's a lot of variety to the music
In and of itself
My attraction to music games personally
Has a lot less to do with the gameplay
And a lot less to do with the music that they use
So that's kind of where I think the strong point of the DJ Max franchise
Is that they really have like a
Very very diverse
Song list across all of the games
Whereas a lot of the Konami games
Shy of pop and music stick with the genre
That is kind of reflective of the gameplay
Itself, so 2DX is a lot of
Electronic music, Guitar Freak Syndrome
And he has a lot of rock, so on and so forth
Now DJ Max has got everything from
Like hip-hop to R&B to like
A plethora
Of electronic genres
And you know
Hard rock music, punk rock music
Hardcore
Classic, I mean like it's
That's really where it shines for me
The gameplay in Technica
If you're speaking of that specifically
It's different
You know there's a lot to it that's similar to the other games
But the whole touchscreen interface
And the way that the interface of the game itself
Functions is different
And it was kind of fresh at the time that it came out
Obviously it's been you know 4 years since then
But it's very fresh
Compared to a lot of other music game interfaces
Out there and it's not too hard to
Pick up and just the way
That you interact with the game is very fun
So I would say you know if you're a fan
Of the music that's what you should be looking forward to
The most because there's just a ton of
Really fantastic music in those games
Alright well we've had Eddie on like way longer
Than we said we were going to have him on
But if he's down with it I want to get
A few questions from the chat room out
So live.vognetwork.com is the place to ask your questions
Let me ask this one
That was asked earlier from DasBacon
Who asked
You got a left check
I'm going to say beforehand by the way
He's my roommate and he works on the website
So his question is kind of like a midpoint
Loaded question alright
I'll ask it anyway since I didn't know that
And I thought it was a good question
What is the future of Bomani Style?
Well we're just
Kind of keep pushing forward really
We had a huge server outage earlier
In the year and
It caused us to lose all the
Original data
It's still out there it's not like the
Original hard drives died or anything like that
But we don't have access to the server that the site used to be
Hosted on due to a complication with our old host
So
You know there was like a good
Six months or so where I
Just kind of gave up on everything
And nothing was getting done
But just recently you know I've got
That bug again and I've got a few people helping us out
And we're going to just kind of push
Forward in getting the most
Recent version that we had been developing
For like the past two years finished and online
With the resources that we have available
And people will start seeing that soon
With the headline section rolling out
We've got a new machine location database
On deck
Score trackers
For just about every single game out there
I mean even ridiculous stuff
Like pop and stage will have a score tracker on the website
We're going to do
Like a greatly expanded
Sim file database because that was like one of the most
Popular things we had on the site with
New sorting options and just like
A lot better ways to promote
Your files than what we had
Before because there was a lot of really
Good stuff that would just get hidden amongst like
A sea of crap and
That's one of the things we definitely want to change
This time around once we get that going
Legend of Zaku wants to know is the
Bimani Land Ranch still open?
We moved
From the Bimani Land Ranch
Now we live in what we call the Bimani Land Resort
Second style
It's a
The old house was a ranch house in Anaheim
California and it was just a really big place
And we had like 30 arcade cabinets there
And the new house
It's not as open to the public as it used to be
Just because of space and we sold off some of the machines
But we still have all of the key machines
You know we keep them updated
And now we have a pool
A hot tub and a koi pond
And a nice atrium so it's like a
Really kind of a relaxed place to hang out
It's still open
If you contact me via email or Facebook
Or whatever if you're going to be in town
We can arrange to have you come over and hang out
Heck yeah we come to Disneyland down there all the time
We're going to come storm the place
If you guys come down here
And not hang out at my house
Let's see
Shane Olinko
Is asking a question
I'm young and cheek but I'll ask it anyway
Because a lot of people always kind of want to know
How do I break into the industry
How can I get hired at Pentavision
I don't even know if this is the one you can answer
I honestly don't even know man
I got hired on accident
Like honestly speaking I got brought in
With a bunch of friends of mine
To consult for Technica 2
When it first came out and we were helping them
With the Technica 2.5
Project that never actually ended up happening
And in one of the meetings
They were basically staying
They really liked
Or they appreciated all the help that we were giving them
And were like well we wish we could compensate you some way
And I was working for this just
Awful bankruptcy law firm
Doing all their online marketing and I was just like
Give me a job, get me out of my job
And it's cool, I'll do all this stuff for free
And they brought me on
Nice
So you just got to beg and ask a lot
Well it wasn't really
Like a begging kind of situation
They put it on the table first
I just said hey hire me
And it just ended up working out that way
You know Pentavision is a company
Here in the US specifically
They're really in tune
With the fans, they like listening to input
A lot and they really feel bad
When they do something that ends up disappointing
People
So really it's just a matter of like I'm sure
Whenever we end up hiring
Which isn't really something we have on deck right now
But whenever we end up hiring I'm sure
The doors will be open to members of the community
Who are passionate enough that have the skills
To want to work with us
So I guess just keep an eye out on the Pentavision
Global website
If we ever throw up any job postings
Give us a contact
Let me ask this question from somebody
They didn't change their nickname so I'll just call them 693
Because that's the number they got
What do you think is the future
What do you think is the future of console
Rhythm music games
And he follows up and says specifically
Ronnie CS games but I'm kind of interested
In the general sense
What do you think is the future of console music games
In North America
I really couldn't even give you
An honest answer
The market in the US has
Just proven itself to not be there
Especially as of late
Harmonix has a good thing going with
The Rock Band 3 setup
The game doesn't need anything else added to it
So just cranking out new songs is perfect
For their existing user base
And Dance Central
Dance Central and Just Dance
Those will probably continue to be
Yearly games just because of the necessity
Of releasing them on a disc
There's a lot of data that goes into
The moves and choreographing
The characters and stuff
So I'm sure those will continue to be on disc
But as far as hardcore music games
I can't be 100% certain
Of this and I know I'm gonna
Break wide open
Some news here but
Konami didn't show DDR at E3
This year and when I
Had asked them about it they had stated
That it was because they wanted to take the franchise
Back to the drawing board and figure out
A new way to do it that could
Cross both types of rhythm
Gamers
I've wanted to pitch that
I've been talking about that for a long time
Well they clearly stole it from you
Damn it I wanted to pitch something that was a cross
Between Dance Dance Revolution and Dance Masters
Basically kind of like what Dance Central is
So you've got some of the appeals to arcade fans
Some of the appeals to like
Just Dance stuff and then also on top of that
Have some sort of
I had envisioned
This kind of revolution adventure
Kind of taking their adventure mode
But way beyond where they had it
Alright let the man finish I want to hear E3 gossip
So anyway
They had told me that they wanted to take it back to the drawing board
I don't really know what that meant
And this wasn't really a confirmation from them
But through a mutual friend of mine
Or ours I should say
I found out
Maybe
Three or four weeks ago
That right around E3
I think maybe two weeks beforehand
That Naoki had quit Konami
And it's speculative on my behalf
But I would not be surprised
If that had something to do with the delay
In the game this year because he was the one
That was heading up that entire project
So I know since then
Things have been handed off to U1
Who's heading up DDR 2013
In the arcades
But yeah
As far as the US goes I really couldn't say
It's too hard to tell
I mean Pentavision we're releasing
DJ Max Technica Tune soon
But realistically
We're just not sure
How it's going to sell because the Vita
Is not a very widely performing
Platform right now
And it's been really hard
To market that game as a result of some of the
Contracts we have in place with our worldwide
Partners so the word hasn't gotten
Out about that title enough
In terms of Japanese music games
I don't
My honest opinion is I don't think they really
Need to do console versions for them
Anymore because they have the arcades
And I think that when you do
A console version of a game that is primarily
An arcade game like it is over there
You're just taking
Activity away from the arcades at that point
And so it's not to say
That I don't think Konami will ever do another
Console music game because obviously they're doing
You know Ubeat and Reflectbeat on the iPad
But I don't think that they really need to do
The console games I know that a lot of North
American fans hate me for saying that
And it definitely feel like they're owed
Those console games but that's not the way
The market works in Japan and since the games
Are primarily Japanese I think that
You know that's just kind of the state of
Where they're at
But without the console version of DDR how will I make my
Data
See they made that really
Crappy flash utility
For DDRX in the US
And a whole five people used it
So I'm sure there's
Ways around it it's not like people aren't clever
There's a guy out there that wrote a utility
That lets you create edits in StepMania
And then export them as data that you could use in the
Arcade cabinets so
People in the Bimani community are way too
Clever for their own good sometimes
See I know what the solution to everything is
To Para Para
Dance Masters is though
I actually like Dance Masters
Because of the Para Para
Well Dance Evolution came out as an arcade cabinet in Japan
And apparently it's one of those
Games that's not talked about widely but they get regular
Updates with new songs
So it's still kind of doing
Well I guess and it you know that was one of the
Questions that I asked Naoki when we talked at
E3 a few years ago when Dance Masters
Had been first released I said you know
I noticed that Night of Fire is in this game
And just you use the original
Routine for it
Is this influenced by Para Para
At all? And he was like no
No I worked on Para Para but it's not the same game
But it's Para Para it's essentially like the
Connect version of Para
Especially since they opened the old location of
Valfar up as Nikufar
You know the Para Para scene is coming back so
Yeah well they never really died
It just kind of like shrunk and now it's
Expanding again so
You know it's just one of those things I guess
Maybe when it gets big enough
To make them make notice again
And it's got like a type of music that it
Latches onto once again because I think
I don't know if like the Hyper
Or was it Hyper Techno stuff I don't know if that's
Still really as relevant as it was a few years ago
But I think if they latch onto
A new style of music and it becomes popular
In the mainstream of Japan again you could possibly
See another Para Para game get released
Well Eddie you've been a really good sport
On the show tonight I know we
Said we'd have you on for about 20 minutes
We're closer to 40 almost 45 now
So I want to thank you for taking the extra time
On the show tonight before we wrap up there is
A question I always ask all the guests that come on
The show what are
You playing these days and it doesn't even have to
Be music games unless it happens to be music games
What video games are you into right now?
I've been playing
A little bit of
New Super Mario Brothers 2
Although I haven't been able to get into it as much as
The original one for the DS
Actually
I feel kind of weird saying it
But I've been really addicted
To the Adventure Time turbo jumping
Fin game on iOS lately
It's such like a
It's an easy pick up and play like I could play it
For two minutes anywhere and then like I'm all
Over that and I love Adventure Time
I'm obsessed with it and I can't wait for the game coming out
Later this month but
Other than that
I'm going to start playing
Halo 4 soon and
I'm planning to pick up Super Paper Mario Sticker Star
Later on this week
Nice, well Eddie before we let you go
I want to get the plugs out there for your stuff
If you don't already know about this website
And you're into music game fans
Or if you're into music games I'm not sure how that's possible
But bimanistyle.com
Is the place to get all the latest and greatest
And what's going on in the music game scene especially
Overseas and so forth right?
Oh yeah I mean well
I don't want to be
Egotistical about it there are other
Resources out there that have been doing a better job
Than us lately but we try our best
And we have a lot of
Friends in the industry so we come up with some
Pretty interesting stuff from time to time
So I'd say we're worth checking out
Anything else you want to plug while you're here on the show tonight?
If you guys are in the Chicago
Land area this upcoming May
I'm not really too sure of the dates I'd go check it out on
Asen.org but we are doing
Another show at Anime Central this upcoming year
With the Japanese guys
We haven't announced the roster
Yet but the guys we have on deck a lot of them
Have had music in the most recent Konami
Music games and the parties we do are
A really good time you can ask anybody who's been there
So check out
Anime Central next year in Chicago
And come party it up with us
Alright I'm going to close tonight with a question
From Miko in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com
Eddie
Does solo suck anyway?
Dude
You don't even need to ask me the question
Or the answer to that question everybody knows
That solo does suck anyway
And before I leave I do want to say this too
Apparently DJ Hung
Has been found working the shoe
Department of Nordstrom's in
Northern California recently
He was spotted not too long ago
And I really wanted to run into the
Department store and ask him that question
But he wasn't working the day that I was in town
I have memories
Good times. Eddie from
BimaniStyle.com thank you so much for being on the show
And talking what
We started all about
And one of our original loves the music game scene
And good luck with everything over at Pentavision
And with the website and so forth alright?
I really appreciate it
And anytime you guys want to have me on just hit me up
Absolutely we'll have you back soon
Alright sounds good. Alright take care buddy
Yep see you later. Bye

Thanks to Eddie from BimaniStyle.com
For coming on the show appreciate that
He works at the shoe department
At Nordstrom's that guy
Hey you know what
A couple of the
People that you know
The step squad ladies are now moms
You know
A few people have
Shed whole people
It's really amazing to look
At like some of those people that we knew
Ten years ago and would see at the DER tournaments
And so forth and like what they're all doing now
And it's funny like some of them went to go work in the industry
Like you know Mel B and Shane and some of those people
And some of them I look at and they're like
Getting married and stuff and I'm like I knew you
When you were 13
Yikes
Alright anyhow that was a very long interview
But it was great worth every minute
But we do want to keep moving on with the show

Keep it indie that's all we ask
To register participation
For this week's episode of orange lounge radio
At vog network dot com
Use the pass phrase detail
Let's move on with some news
Finally Loki
Hey that's alright it was a great great show
So far tonight absolutely fantastic
So let's talk a little bit about the Wii U because
We're right we're very close
To the Wii U launch one week from today
And of course there's still
Some of that stuff
Out there that we don't yet know
But mainly kind of tied with the whole network stuff
So first off what is
Nintendo network ID
And they actually have this whole kind of
Either Nintendo
Direct press conference
Or not even press conference like
Consumer conferencing
Stream web video whatever you want to call it
Anyways so they talked a little bit about it
Basically what it is is that the friend code
System has kind of been
It's gone away and now it's being replaced by this
Nintendo network ID
And what the ID is going to be used for is
Basically like the 3DS
They say smartphones
And PCs
Also of course
The Wii U
And it's going to be basically tied so that
You know you have all your software
You know logged into one thing
In layman's terms
It's basically going to be an account name
So like you know you have an Xbox Live
Or Playstation Network you have an account
All that stuff is tied to you're going to have an account
That's going to be a name and tie it to that
And you can make
Your friends and do all that stuff
So fantastic
Getting with the 21st century
And getting rid of stupid friend codes
Welcome to the big kids table
Nintendo yay
Mommy wow
Yes so it says basically
Users can exchange
You know the
Number of whatever this number is
Or
I guess just like a friends code
But then also they'll also be able to
Register friends I guess
They meet with Mevers so there may be a
Number still tied to your account
However I think they're going to have
A name to that as well
Or it's going to be just one number
That you're going to have for all future
Nintendo consoles or whatever
So there's that and then of course
That sounds a lot like the battle net battle tags
Just so you know like where you have like the
Name and then the random numbers at the end
So then also of course they've got
The Wii U chat stuff and they said that
Of course you're going to be able to talk to each other
Using chat they say that
I guess users
Will be able to draw images on the chat
Window while they talk and
Instant hilarity
Just add cocks
Because you know
That's what's going to happen. What else are people
Going to draw on the screens?
Like I'm going to have a video chat with
Loki and I'm going to draw a big dick
Right next to his head and it'll be hilarious
I think that
Photo I took at Fry's spells it out
Which one is this?
The one where I walked by the monitor and there was a big
Dick on it that someone drew
Of course
So yeah they have that stuff
Also they're saying that
That I guess people can
Place calls to each other through the Wii U chat
And there's going to be a light on the gamepad
They'll blink to indicate that there's an incoming
Call or something like that
It just sounds like it's very basic stuff that they're
Just describing in a very complex way that
You know makes it sound like
Oh hey look we've got video chat on our system
Now that everybody's had
This for years now but hey it's a new thing
And it's cutting edge because
We're now doing it
And then of course also
They have the new Mii Plaza
Which is now Mii Wara Wara
Or Wara Wara Plaza which I guess
Wara Wara means bustling
In Japanese
Was it Wara Wara?
Yes. Yeah that's going to change for the US
Yeah it's
Well actually apparently
The English name will be the
Wara Wara Plaza
I'm fine with that
Which the distant cousin of
Wuhu Island
Which why can't it be Mii Plaza?
Or the Wii U Plaza
Or the home screen
Or something like that
Why does it have to be something ridiculous?
No it should be Mii Gusta
But anyways
Yeah so it looks like
Basically your Mii Plaza that you had had
On the Wii
Now there's titles that
You may have played in the Wii U games
And stuff like that that they're huddling around
Which
I don't know
I'm not that excited about
But whatever
Not for me and also
Like they said before
This is going to be a day one download so
It won't actually come on your system
So if you don't have connection to the internet
Obviously you're not going to have any friends that are going to be on there
Well if you don't have a connection to the internet you're probably not
Going to be hearing this show
Well you may have a connection at work
Or something like that
I'm just saying
You may not have a connection to the internet at home
Or you know your console
May not be in an area
Maybe you're in the dark ages and you don't have
A wifi router or something like that
Or it just doesn't work through
Your walls or something
You may have connectivity issues
Either way
So you're going to have to download this as a day one
And I believe the internet browser
Is going to be part of that
So
Well
Moving on into other news
About Valve
I know we're all excited about whatever Valve's got
Going on next even though we have no idea what it could possibly be
Although I think we're all hoping it's like Half Life 3
Maybe
Gabe Newell apparently got a visit
This past week from
A bunch of users from 4chan.org
Uh oh
But the Vboard
Specifically went to go visit Gabe Newell
For his birthday
That's pretty hilarious
And asked him some questions
And of course there's YouTubes of it all over the internet
Newell did say no Half Life 3 questions
So that wasn't out there
But that doesn't mean they couldn't get some other questions
Such as is Valve working on a new
Source engine
And Newell said we've been working on a new engine stuff for a while
There was some
Garbled audio with subtitles that say
We've just been waiting for a game to roll it out with
And uh
There was another question asked saying
Is it more than just an extension to Source
Like is it an entirely new engine
And Gabe Newell said
Yeah
Apparently the rumor mill's still
Pumping out there on Source 2
This is after the uncovered code in August
Wouldn't Source 2 be awesome
For like you know launching a console
That they would be making themselves
Perhaps with a game called Half Life 3
That would sell a lot of consoles
Or you know whatever they're gonna be
I want Half Life Ponies
Well the game they are making is Ricochet 2
That was something that Gabe Newell did confirm
Is in development
Maybe that's the first game on the engine
That could be the game for 2014
Who knows
Alright let's move on with some more news
Dark Sakura
Oh Square
Oh Square
We need sad music
I don't know
What about Aerith dying music
Alright we can do
Alright I'll get some sad music
But that's happy music for me
Aerith living
Aerith living
Aerith living music I don't know
Yeah well Aerith dying music was happy for me
Because I hated her
Should just be the sound of the sword
Shink shink
Ten hours of
That's better
That's better
So Final Fantasy 14
Has come to an end
Dun dun dun
And um
Yeah instead of
Some of the stuff that people were promised
What they had was basically
Server farting
They got a really nice cinematic
I'm just imagining
I'm just imagining actual
Literal server farting
This is the end
Oh well this is
Unexpected
You shouldn't be making fart noises
Over this very sad song
This is happy music
Remember vote for us at the podcast awards
Yay she's
Dead awesome
My favorite part
My save file still works by the way
Anyway
People were basically
Logging on you
Those few loyal
Deluded people who were still
Into the game Hey I have friends that were still playing
Final Fantasy 14
You like what you like
I can't make fun of anybody this week
Because I've popped so many squares
On that curiosity cube
I can't judge anybody I'm sorry
What was the line from
Money Python? Don't know much about art
But I know what I like
So
I'm just going to read the quote
From one of the players
There were so many waiting to
Log in and fight in the promised epic battles
That Square Enix had to start
Turning players away based on subscription
End date
So those who were in had bad lag
Especially in menus and couldn't
Form parties
When they actually did get
To fight some of these epic
Monsters they were promised
They were
It was like these
Level 100 monsters that were only ever
Seen in cutscenes
They really couldn't get much
About it so basically the last server message
Just pretty much bleeped over and over
Again
Confound contact with main host
What a way to go
Yeah but there's a pretty nice
Cinematic up on Kotaku so go watch that
That's the only good thing to ever come out of Final Fantasy 14
Actually by pretty nice
Pretty fucking amazing
If you do watch the mag it's pretty epic
I'm very curious about
This realm reborn
I can't believe they went so far
As to just pull the fucking plug on 14
As it was and saying alright
Hold up you guys we got this
Just give us about 6 months to get it up and running again
Crazy
Alright we'll just do a real
Update this time instead of just
Poopooing out something
Alright well we'll see what happens
If it was worth the wait or if it is
Poopoo
In the meantime something a little closer
To look forward to this week's release dates

That's awful
With a lot of weird sound effects
Can we talk Skylanders Giants for a minute?
I went to Toys R Us randomly the other day
Oh my god
There was just an entire
wall filled with
all that stuff
Dang, they are making bank off
Whoever thought of that
idea to charge people

Alright, let's go
There's a lot of talk in our chat room
I want to acknowledge the chat at live.vognetwork.com
kind of talking about Final Fantasy 14
to Jamie's story
Stan in chat asks
So Final Fantasy 14 is completely dead now
or is reborn replacing it?
The latter, reborn is replacing it
and yes, 14 is dead now
There is this gap happening
and YYR mentions it a little earlier in chat
with, what did he say?
They're really going to have to start over
Shouldn't they have wanted to at least retain
the small audience they had?
They are hoping they'll come back
and I think the ones that were
loyal to 14 until the very end
I think they will come back
I mean, for them to have held out on that game that long
they'll come back
Here's my prediction for the whole thing
I'll come back when they make 11
free to play
I'll withhold judgement until I see it
You know, if 14
the real one
which is really what this is now
I know they're calling it reborn
but they want us to see it as Final Fantasy 14
No, really this time
If it's a good game, then it's a good game
and I've got to play a good game, right?
We'll see
Alright, anyhow, moving to
Japan and the releases over there
there's quite a bit over there as well
Assassin's Creed 3 gets its Japanese release on the 15th
Some Platinum Collection titles
Dance Central connects sports, including
Season 2 and what they call the Ultimate Collection
which is both
Need for Speed Most Wanted gets a Criterion
release, Nike and Connect
Training and Steins Gate
Hiyoko Ruri no Darling
also gets a price reduction as well
so lots of price reductions and
Assassin's Creed 3, just in time for
the holidays. On the Playstation 3
also Assassin's Creed 3
Need for Speed Most Wanted and
Dream Club Complete
Edi Pion gets a release
that's from D3 on the Playstation 3
Going to the handhelds on the
Playstation Vita, Assassin's Creed 3
Lady Liberty is there, as well
as a Need for Speed Most Wanted release
and some new Vita
packs are coming out
the 3G Wi-Fi model
in Cosmic Red and Sapphire Blue
I remember reading about those earlier
those are finally seeing their release in Japan this week
so if you've been waiting for that pretty blue
PS Vita, Shane, there it is
On the
3DS
Aikatsu Cinderella lesson
comes out
I don't know what lesson they'll be teaching
Clean the toilets!
Change the firewood!
It's a game to teach you how to clean your house
That'd be hilarious
On the 3DS
Clean your house, or else no man will love you
Stop it
Unchained Blades Exiv comes out
Inazuma 11-123
Endou Mamoru Densetsu
and Monster Hunter 3G
gets a price reduction
that might be of interest to some people
Now, I'm looking at this and I don't think
this is like Cinderella like the fairy tale
This girl dressed up
in the little Playboy bunny outfit and pink
skirt, that's not what I think of
and I think of Cinderella
It looks like overtly shoujo manga style
Yeah, so I don't think
Disney Cinderella
I'm thinking something else
Isn't the lesson still the same?
Cinderella's lesson was if you want that man
you go get him
And you take lots of drugs
so you think that you're being
met by fairy godmothers
There's no Q
16th we have Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed
and Sims 3 The Seasons
You know what?
I quit Sims 3 after World Adventures
because I had way too much
custom content that it lagged my game
It was really
El Cubo is the re-release
of the GameCube, the Latin America version
For England
Well
they like to mix it up a bit
Somehow I don't think that's Castilian
Spanish
Hey, I may be an expert in Spanish
but that sounds pretty sound to me
El anything
is Spanish
It could be Portuguese
It could be
Or it could be
Moving On With More News, the classic game of the week
coming up real soon
Alright
As I kind of alluded to earlier
with the need to sell some of those
combo packs for UFC
THQ is not doing real well
In fact you may remember that
a while ago they actually had
unsplit
their stocks, a reverse
stock split, 10 to 1
taking all their, you know, 51 cent
share stocks and
combining them together to equal
$5.16 share
stocks
You know, because their stock price
fell so low that it was going to be delisted
Problem is
Now their stock has dropped
down to $1.74
42%
So
If you think about it
those stocks really wouldn't be worth crap
They'd be worth like $0.17
Good times
Good times, yeah
So that is unfortunate
And of course I'm sure it's not helping by the fact that
a lot of those
games have kind of
You know, oh I'm sorry
It closed down to $1.50
It dropped even further
So 50%
It's probably not helping that a lot of the games
that they were going to be coming out with
have been delayed
I understand why they're doing it
It's admirable
but at the same time
I'm kind of wondering
Damn, I hope you guys survive
all these delays
Well what's interesting, Legend of Zaku in our chatroom
at live.vognetwork.com says
Seriously, they'll be dead in six months
But Shadow Next Gen follows that up with
people said that six months ago
That's true, and the whole thing now
is that they want to
focus on quality, which is great
So South Park, Metro Last Light, and
Company of Heroes 2 have all been delayed
to the next fiscal year
So that doesn't necessarily mean that
they're not coming out, it just means that they're
delayed a few months
because originally this stuff was supposed to come out in the first quarter
of 2013
and even as
I alluded to
they were saying
When I joined THQ, the company made a public commitment
to the quality of titles
and we've always expected that
in some cases this would mean that more time
would be needed to make sure that every title
is of the highest possible quality
and our fourth quarter releases
are the first titles that I have
that have the ability to
materially impact an experience
told me that
games needed additional
development time to be market ready
Thank you for releasing games that
are polished as opposed to
just putting them out there because
eh, we won't make money
So let's hope that that actually
pays off and these games are even
better than what they would have been had they just
put them out when they were
ready to put them out
So we'll see
However, that's still not helping the fact that they
defaulted on their 50 million dollar loan
that they had
with Wells Fargo
So, not
too good
Sad trombone
Yes, so apparently they had
borrowed I guess 21 million
dollars from the credit that they had
and
I guess they had like this 50 million
dollar revolving credit and
yeah, not good
so
Hopefully they will be able to
recoup from all these losses and stuff
and put out some good games
I mean after all, South Park looks awesome
I'm not a big fan of Company of Heroes
but Metro Last Light looks pretty sweet
And you need a Saints Row 4
Right? That's what Rama in our chat room
just said
Rama in the chat, they better
give me my Saints Row 4 before
they go down like the claims
Saints Row, you know
what they were planning to do with that, the whole
enter the dominatrix thing, which to be honest
looked like shit
I would have still bought it, but it still looks like shit
but they're making a fourth
game that's supposed to be better
but at the same time they're saying they're kind of incorporating
all the stuff that was going to be in Saints Row
you know, enter the dominatrix
so it makes me worry that Saints Row
4 is going to just kind of feel like an expansion
on 3, which
not different enough for me, but I still
will buy it because I like Saints Row
but I will still be pissed off if it's just
a cash grab like the other
games have been, but hopefully they kind of learn from their
lesson, or didn't learn from their lesson because they made a lot
of money off of all the DLC
Alright, let's move on to some
announcements from Blizzard, who also had an earnings
call this week, Starcraft
2 Heart of the Swarm, this expansion
they've been working on for quite a while
is finally due out in the first
half of 2013
that's according to Mike Morhaime, who is the head
of Blizzard, he did make that announcement during
Activision's earnings call, saying that they are
quote, working hard towards a first half
2013 launch, that wouldn't be
too surprising to anyone who's been following Blizzard
for a while, they put out two big games
this year already between Diablo 3 and
Mists of Pandaria, so them
holding onto this for 2013 is no
surprise at all, I would think though it's
going to happen after the end of the fiscal quarter
to give them something to buoy up the next
fiscal year, but we'll see
we'll see, speaking of Diablo
3, they have surpassed 10 million
sold, and it was confirmed
to I'm sure no one's surprise
an expansion for Diablo 3
is in the works, I'd be
very curious to see how that expansion
does though, because let's not forget a lot of those
Diablo 3's, well, maybe that's not
I was going to say a lot, but it's more like
a million came through that annual
pass, and I guess 1 million out of 10 million
still 10% is pretty
you know, but I'd be very curious
Diablo 3 hasn't exactly had the warmest
reception either, it has its
fans, certainly, but I
just don't hear about it the same way
I heard the enthusiasm for Diablo 2
and I know some Diablo fans might want to challenge
me on that, and that's fine, but I just
I don't hear that same enthusiasm
that I heard behind part 2
so I'd be very curious how an expansion is going to do
for them, but I'm sure
it would be as well received as Starcraft 2
I mean, Starcraft 2 also, you know
it's popular, but not popular
like Starcraft 1 was
does that make sense? I don't know
also, a class action
lawsuit being filed against
Blizzard
you know, they make World of Warcraft
Starcraft, Diablo 3, and it has to
do with the authenticators
apparently
who are the guys that are
filing this lawsuit here?
it's
Carney, William Bates, Pullum
and Bowman PLLC
they are litigating Benjamin
Bell et al. versus Blizzard
Entertainment, saying that
all of this is negligent and deceptive
practices related to
Blizzard's customers' account security
the fact that for a while
you had to buy a keychain
authenticator for $6.50
technically you still do have to buy that
authenticator if you really want to protect your account
however, what I'm not hearing about
in this lawsuit is, oh yeah, there's the
free one on the smartphones
and so forth. Don't they have a PC app now?
I don't think so, just on smartphones
maybe, I don't know
I've had the smartphone one for so long, I don't know
the claim is drawing
against the August 9th
battle net breach
where Blizzard, they actually
disclosed that yes, people got in
they didn't get any sensitive information
but were making people reset their passwords
anyways, and the
lawsuit saying that Blizzard's negligence
in maintaining proper
security protocols is resulting
in deceptive upselling
so in other words, because Blizzard
can't protect their shit, or is
negligent in protecting their shit, they're selling
you an authenticator so that
they're making you buy this to protect
your shit. That's gonna get thrown out because
honestly, my
I've had an authenticator
for years and it hasn't done
a damn thing for
anyone getting it and getting any information
that had, the authenticator
had nothing to do with it
it wasn't
like, I think that
they got encrypted data
was it nothing solid? And it was anything
that could have been changed immediately
that wouldn't have changed his present level of
security. Well, here's the thing though
I mean, as much as I do think
I agree with you, it's gonna get thrown out of court
but I would like to know
why were so many Blizzard
accounts hacked before authenticators
before the mobile authenticator
came out? Because there was about a year gap
where you only had the
$6.50 ones, and as a Warcraft
player, I did feel like
why are they making me buy an
authenticator when they can't protect my shit?
You know, and I was like
why are so many people getting hacked? What happened
here? How did all our passwords get out?
I kinda would like that to come to light
I would like to know, how many million people
have had to call Blizzard because of an account breach?
Granted, I think
that the authenticator was more put out as something
that was for peace of mind
because I've done remote work
where I had to have an onsite
authenticator to get into the server
so it's basically an added
layer of protection on
user side. I think that
it doesn't really matter
how much security you
have on the website. If someone wants to get in, they're gonna
get in. So this
basically just gives you an extra
layer.
If anything, I would think that the authenticator price
was just to cover the cost of the actual authenticator
I don't think they were actually profiting off of it because
it was
something that required having
a device
in your hands to basically
pair the random numbers
with so
it's not like something that you
obviously, once smartphones
came out to the masses
and everything like that, they could do an app
instead but
that's probably why they had to sell it in the first place
because they don't want to lose $6.50 on every single
one they send out for people. Granted
it didn't seem to help for it. They should have just
included it in the collector's edition though
I don't know, I don't understand why they just didn't
include it. Did they do that actually in some of them? No.
I thought that they had one of the expansions that had an
authenticator in there. I don't think it was
Warcraft.
Might have been Starcraft, but I don't remember.
I don't know, they were just handing them out at cons.
Yeah, but that's different.
Alright, anyhow, we need to
take a time back into
classic gaming and classic games history
and remember when things weren't so
simple and so much shit was getting hacked.
At least I don't think this game
ever got hacked.
It stole your credit card information.
It's the classic game of the week.
Every week DarkSakura goes into the vault
and finds a classic game that she thinks, hey
you little brats.
This one smells like rotten fruit. Play this game
or I'll kill you.
Get off my lawn. Go play a game.
I'll kill you like you're Eris.
Eris.
Hey, even in Wreck-It Ralph
they got it right. Murica.
In
Murica we say Eris.
Alright, what is the classic game of the week?
Super Pac-Man.
I like this one.
I'm surprised I haven't done it because I actually
really like Super Pac-Man.
Actually the thing that I linked is basically
someone figuring out the ghost patterns in the game.
And totally manipulating
a full game.
But anyway
in Super Pac-Man it was
the second game
in the series that was actually done by
Namco. Ms. Pac-Man
was done by Midway.
So this is a true
Namco sequel
but you know people didn't really care
for it as much because it changed the gameplay
really radically.
It actually
in the game you actually went around
and ate fruit.
Instead of the little power pills.
And then you did get
special pellets.
You had your
regular power pills which you could use to
eat ghosts. You had keys
that you could get to unlock doors
so that you could get to the fruits
inside. And then
you had super pellets. And if you got the super
pellet then you would turn into Super
Pac-Man and could go through doors and fly
over everything. And you had a button
that would make you go faster.
On top of that
there was a little neat, I thought it was a
neat little effect where the ghosts would kind of flatten
down a bit to make it look like you were really
flying over them.
Now
you could not eat a ghost
as Super Pac-Man
but if you ate a power pill
like a regular power pill
while you were
in super mode then you could eat ghosts.
The big thing about
that is you also had bonus
levels too after every
second level. Where basically you just try
to go through and eat the fruit and everything
as fast as you can.
With this one
it's actually one
of the first Pac-Man games
that used the Motorola 6809 processor.
The previous one used the
Z80. And so this went
into the same category as
Galaxian for the conversion class.
However, it didn't
really prove to be very successful
because it was actually
very different than the usual
gameplay. It was kind of fucking weird actually.
It was. Pac-Man Plus
which was just an updated version of the original
I mean kind of like Ms. Pac-Man
basically
outsold it. Midway also
did Junior Pac-Man which
also went on the old Z80
processor and
that one also went to be a very
successful Pac-Man game.
However, they do say that the AI
for Super Pac-Man is
one of the best of that time.
Super
Pac-Man has been out on a lot of
different systems. In 84 there was
a port for the Atari 5200
but it never came out because
the video game crashed. Why is he eating shoes
in this level? You don't eat shoes. I don't
know. I get the donuts and the burgers
and the apples but shoes?
Don't eat shoes. Leather.
In
1988 there was a Dawson Commodore 64
version that came out by Thunder Mountain.
Did you have this file? F yeah.
In
96 it showed up
on the A for the Namco
Museum arcade compilation
on the Playstation. In 98
it came out for Namco History volume 3
and that was
on the PC in Japan only. In 99
Super Pac-Man was released
with Ms. Pac-Man in Ms. Pac-Man
Special Color Edition for the Game Boy Color.
I had that. I played the crap out of it.
2006
there was a plug and play Super Pac-Man
that included that along with
Pac-Man, Pac-Man Plus, and Pac and Pal
which honestly Pac and Pal is seriously
not one of my favorites.
It also
came in the TV Games Pac-Man
Gold edition and the Retro Arcade.
Namco has also done
a portable version for cell phones
that come out on
that are put out by Sprint.
Sprint and Namco actually
had a sweepstakes where you could win
a Volkswagen new Beetle customized
Super Pac-Man art and
it was on display at E3 in 2006.
Do you remember this?
The Beetle with the
Super Pac-Man stuff? I do.
Yeah.
It ended
on July 31, 2006.
There was a Palm PDA version
that was Super Pac-Man at Handango.
Whatever.
There was another
release with Pac and Pal, Pac and Roll, and Pac-Mania
on Namco Museum
Remix.
Super Pac-Man is now out
on mobile films with 3D graphics
and better sound effects.
And then we have it on the Namco Museum Virtual Arcade
for Xbox 360 that came out in 2008.
So there you go.
Super Pac-Man. There it is, your classic
game of the week, Super Pac-Man.
I liked this one, even though it was really weird.
It was weird. I liked it.
You know how I feel about
weird. I love that cut scene.
He's like, grin.
Where a giant ball of
Pac-Man falls on the ghost, they turn blue and squish.
Don't eat mushrooms! Some of them are
poisonous! But what if they're shiitake?
Shiitake are delicious. I guess that's alright.
I made the best dinner that was
shiitake mushrooms, enoki mushrooms,
and, um,
I can't remember, but
there are these other little mushrooms that kind of join at the base
and you have to cut the base off. It was so good, anyway.
The front lawn mushrooms.
No, not front lawn mushrooms.
Alright, anyhow.
Alright, Super Pac-Man,
your classic game of the week,
in a million different Namco
collections, as Jamie mentioned
there a little bit ago.
We're actually not taking a break tonight.
We have another interview,
and this one's prior taped.
This is actually coming to us from
DJ Rama S,
and Anime Jam Session,
which is a show you can hear at the Voice
of Geeks Network, or vognetwork.com,
on Tuesday nights, replaying
on Thursday mornings, and
at a recent convention,
Rama got this interview with
Jen, and she is with
the website, I don't want to
mess this up, it's ggvogue.com
ggvogue.com
That is girl gamer
vogue, and Rama is gonna
ask her in this interview some questions about
the website, and why she started
it, and all that good stuff, so
take it away. DJ Rama S will be back
after this interview with more of
Orange Lounge Radio. It's about a ten minute interview,
so we'll be back after this.
Absolutely, we definitely try to get
girls from all over the tri-state area
to kind of just get together,
to meet other girls, to find other venues
and genres that they play with,
and just to have an atmosphere and a community
that they feel pretty proud and comfortable
in. Our
number one passion and mission
is to just provide
a wonderful atmosphere for girl gamers
and empower and inspire them actually,
because ultimately, we
girls need that community,
we need to find
other girls who play games
and just play.
That sounds pretty cool, so what
made you come up with this whole idea?
To be honest, I've
been gaming ever since I was like five.
I remember having an
NES and just playing it,
and it was actually taken away from me by my uncle,
but I was really
a hardcore Sega fan. I'm a hardcore
Sega fan, up until the Dreamcast when it
actually kind of just fell off the face of the earth.
I mean, now they're more of a software company,
but I always realized and remembered
feeling that I never
had a girl that I could always play with.
I went to an all-girls school, up into
high school, and I never
had the companionship, and
I saw that the world lacked that,
a place where you could find that companionship.
It's like, yeah, you can go to forums,
but there isn't a specific venue that you can
kind of just find a girl
that is looking for a Guild Wars 2
Guild mate, or
even if it's just Call of Duty.
That sounds pretty cool.
So what makes Girl Game Evolved
different from other female
gamer clans like the D20 girls
or something like that?
It makes it kind of different.
Well, we're not a clan, per se.
We're a means to an end,
if anything. If you're looking for a clan,
if you're looking for a friend,
we're the place that you would go to
in order to find that clan.
So you're pretty much like the liaison
to connect other gaming girls
to other groups and
clans and teams and so forth.
Okay. I mean, the
website is pretty much kind of like a
magazine. We do previews and reviews of
games. We do video games psychology, so we
teach girls about other
types of genre games, so if you're not
familiar with First Person Shooter, we
kind of talk about that. We also
do kind of like
101 gaming for moms,
so if you're a mom out there and your child
is a son or a daughter who's really into
games, we teach you about the ESRB
rating. We teach you about what games are
good for your child. We also talk
about games you can play as
a mom who's not very familiar with games as well.
That sounds pretty
cool. So how long have you
been running this organization?
Officially, it's been running since
November 2011, but
it's always been a dream and a passion ever since
I can remember.
So where do you see this
site going? What's your vision
for it?
To be honest with anything,
I don't have any expectations
when it comes to this. It's kind of just like
I want to do more.
We definitely want to be able to just
bring more women and more girls and
more gamers into this community because
we want to become
a positive
representation of the gaming community
because in actuality, that's
how the gaming community started. It started
out with gamers
very passionate about their hobbies
and promoting it.
Right now, I'm not
going to say it's unbalanced, but I feel like there's
not a lot of representations for females.
There's not a lot of places that they can go
to to either A.
get the kind of news feeds they want
or B. get the kind of
information they need.
We talk about video game fashion and
we talk about this is actually
a Legend of Zelda
Fire from Ocarina of Time.
It's a jewel, but it's been made out of a necklace.
We showcase things like that because
they're important.
Particularly a girl, if she wanted to
buy that, she could be able to
find it on our website.
That's pretty cool. I like that
concept. I just like
the idea of it and what
you're working with and
where it's going so far.
Outside of this, what kind of games
do you like to play?
Right now,
I'm playing Guild Wars 2
and I love Guild Wars 2 because
I played Aeon and World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy
and I played LOL.
It's just
I love, I don't like
the I hit you, you
hit me kind of gaming.
I actually write for Game Tire and I wrote
an article about the top 15 qualities
for an MMORPG
and Guild Wars 2
just seems to be nailing 85
to 90% of anything that I was
asking for an MMORPG.
Granted, it's not like WoW.
WoW will always, I mean like the
end game is just
like the end game like Instance and Raids
and World of Warcraft.
You can't get that in Guild Wars 2 but
Guild Wars 2 has just so much
more opportunities for you to explore.
You get
points and you get rewarding experiences
for helping out and I feel like
Guild Wars 2 actually has this social aspect.
I play
mostly PS3 and PS2 and PS1
games, I ain't no Sony fan, but
I'm completely a diehard Sega fan.
I still have my Sega Dreamcast, I still have my Gensys.
I didn't get a Saturn but I do
have a Game Gear.
But do you also have a Master System?
I don't have a Master System.
We might have to get her a Master System.
I would love a Master System.
I might know someone may have a spare but I'll have to double
check with that. It's not that
I didn't have it because I didn't want it.
I didn't have it because of funs reasons.
It's all good.
Now, while running World of Warcraft
have you ever reached any difficulties
or any guys going
what?
You know to be honest
yeah, but if I
stopped when I came
I wouldn't be where I am right now.
You really need to understand
that you will come across
people that want you to fail
but you got to understand that you're doing
something that's you.
You are a gamer. I'm a gamer.
I know I'm a gamer and I know what I'm doing
regardless of what anyone does makes me happy.
Well there you go.
I can't argue with that type of logic.
So, when we get out of here, do you have any last words
for any game girls out there who are like
well, I don't know.
You know
to be honest, you can
deny being a gamer all you want.
But the moment you
embrace it and be who you are
even if you play Farmville
even if you play a 3DS
you know, it doesn't
matter. If you're playing something
that is immersed
into a digital world
you're playing a game and you shouldn't
A. demote it
as not being a gamer and B.
you shouldn't diminish anybody else
that's following that.
The video game community is changing
to include everything from
science to medicine
to psychology
to even the industry booming in business.
I mean, even fashion is becoming a big
part of it and the moment
that you discriminate and divide
yourself, you're becoming a factor
in the divide in the gaming industry
that me and many other people
are fighting against.
Wow, those are some strong
powerful words.
Okay, so let me ask you
girl gamer
gamer girl
doesn't really matter.
It doesn't matter. What matters mostly
is that if you say you're a girl gamer
or a gamer girl and then you start posting
photos with you with like controllers
covering your boobs
you're giving
a terrible interpretation of what a
girl gamer is. That is
the line. If you are not
a girl gamer and you're out there and you're
promoting that you're a girl gamer and you're doing
very sensual, provocative
images and representation
you are hindering what we're working for.
I am fighting so hard
and many other women are fighting so hard
to give a positive representation
of girl gamers. And if you're
also directed to all you ladies that are out
there that are doing this, stop.
Because we're fighting
through the right type of gamers
and if you're hurting us
you're an obstacle. And to be
honest, we will try
everything possible to overrun it.
Because what you're doing is you're
defeating us and you're
contradicting what we're working so
hard for. There are people that are spending time
money and effort. There are women who are
spending so much time, money and effort. And if
you're out there, just please stop.
If you want to be sensual
if you want to be provocative, fine.
Do it without a controller. Do it without saying
that you're a girl gamer or a gamer girl.
Because you're putting us in a bad light.
And it's disrespectful
it's hurtful
and it's obnoxious.
Wow, like I said, those are some really
powerful words. So
for everyone that's out
there watching, listening, where can
you find more information about
Girl Gamer Vogue? Well, we're at
GG Vogue, like GG's in Gorilla.
GGVogue.com or Girl Gamer Vogue
you can find us on Facebook, on Twitter,
on Tumblr, on Instagram, on
Flickr. I forget
what other place we're associated with.
But by all means, we need more girls
who are just as passionate and prominent
that are looking for a place to call home.
Most of the people, if not
all, probably like 99%,
they are very comfortable people. You want to
talk about games by all means. We're
associated with a bunch of other communities
as well. And if you want to play
Call of Duty, Guild Wars,
you know, whatever it is, we'll find you a place to
find people, to find girls
that you can be best friends with. And that's
what we only want to be. We want to be good friends with you.
Wow, that's pretty good.
Well, Jen, thank you for your time. Thank you for having
me. Thanks for coming.
No problem. At least we can do.
Whatever we can do for you, we're here for you.
DJ Rama S, signing off.
Welcome back, everybody, to
Orange Lounge Radio.
And thank you, DJ Rama S, for that
interview. And especially
Jen from Girl Gamer
Vogue. I like her.
She's really trying to do a good thing for the
community. I like when she was talking about
educating people about the ESRB
system. And I really think
and I hope everybody's listening to her when she talks
about how, you know,
our community is
kind of growing and really embraced
that, you know, you've got all these different types
of casual gamers and gaming is something
they do in all these different industries and so forth.
So, yeah.
Thanks to
Rama for getting that interview for us.
And thanks to Jen for being on the show,
even though maybe she didn't know she was going to be on Orange Lounge Radio
when she first did that interview.
So, a big thank you all around.
And I want to get
our listeners thinking about this.
Because I really liked what just
happened there. I like that a listener
kind of contributed that
particular segment. And it gave us
something to play on the show that
we could actually put on the podcast
that was interesting to listen to.
And it was, you know, something a little different and the listener
created. So, we
want to try, come December
or so forth, we would like to try
opening up our breaks
to listener created content.
Now, that particular
piece was a little bit long.
But we're talking, think about something maybe
a minute and a half to two minutes long.
Maybe a news update
on a particular game or series that you enjoy.
Or, you know, maybe
some community updates for a particular
community that you're a fan of.
Or something along those lines.
We're not going to start playing those next week.
But it's something we're looking at for December.
Something where the users create content.
Now, I do want to be clear on a few
things.
You won't be able to actually represent
OLR and go get
interviews and say, oh, my interview is going to be
on OLR. No, no, that's
for myself, Dark Soccer, and Loki to do.
But, you know, talk to us
if you have some ideas along those lines.
We'll see what we can arrange. We just, you know, if
you're going to represent OLR, we have to make sure that you're
not going to do something that could
anger a potential guest or what have you.
So, just be thinking about that.
We'll give you more details in the coming weeks.
But that's something we're hoping
to do on the show is institute
user-created content
in our breaks. So, awesome.
And remember, I am
Omega.
Damn, apparently
the live listeners lost the feed for a moment
while I was making that pitch. But once again,
we're looking at doing listener-created content
during the breaks instead of music in little
two-minute chunks or less
for, you know, whatever community it is
that you're passionate about. After all,
it's the show where every gamer has a
voice, and I think we've been neglecting
one big way to get
your voices on the show. Yeah,
OLR reporters, OLR freelancers.
I'm loving those terms in chat. Perfect.
So, more information to come in the
coming weeks. That's something we want to implement in
January, or excuse me, December.
Meanwhile, let's
get back into some rapid-fire
news. Loki, start us off.
Alright. So, let's see.
Let's talk a little bit about Black Ops
2 since that's going to be coming out this week.
One of the things that they just recently announced
before they had the whole
streaming that you can do of your gameplay
with the League play and stuff like that.
Well, now it's been confirmed that
that's going to be linked in with
YouTube live streaming. So, you're going to
build a live stream on Xbox
360, PlayStation 3, and
on the PC version as well.
No word on the Wii U yet because
a lot of the integration that they have with Elite and stuff
like that on the Wii U doesn't quite work.
But, it's pretty cool. Also, I guess
you're going to be able to see the player's gamer card
of whoever you're streaming and some other
additional information like class loadouts
and stats and stuff like that.
It's pretty cool. I actually did spot
some of this stuff when I was doing the
local play stuff.
They had some options for that, but
really neat that you'll be able to live stream games.
I kind of wish they had that for Grand Theft Auto, but
that's still a ways away.
Neat.
It's a neat idea. I know live streaming
is pretty popular nowadays.
I think that's a neat thing to build into the game, too.
Yeah,
I'm curious what this is going to bring.
It's neat. Well, it's cool, too,
because a lot of people don't have the hardware
to kind of video capture everything that they're doing,
so this is kind of built into the game, which
I think is pretty cool. Well, it's fascinating how the
industry is really embracing it, too. I would have
assumed there was going to be resistance to it,
especially, you know, we talked about the Microsoft policy
and all that stuff some time ago,
which is kind of this strange in the middle
place, but it is very interesting
how, you know, instead of
the game companies going to
try and shut down places like Twitch TV
and the other streaming sites, they're really saying,
alright, this is something people want to do.
It's promotion for our game. Let's do it.
Yeah. Now, here's a weird
promotion. They're doing something with Halo 4
and their multiplayer, where
they're actually allowing players to
get Microsoft
points for playing multiplayer,
and here's how it works. Okay, so
basically, if you get Halo 4
and you play 35
hours plus, and this is between
launch until the end of this month,
so November 30th is a cutoff for it,
but if you play over 35
hours, you're going to get 100 Microsoft
points. If you...
Whoopee! I know. Whoopee shit.
Ooh, a dollar and like
20 cents or something. Okay, so then
if you play
$1.25, that's what it was,
70 hours,
guess what?
You're going to double that.
Or, I'm sorry, you're going to triple that. You're going to get
300 Microsoft points.
Yay, a denomination that
totally doesn't round out anything.
So, you're going to have
300 Microsoft points possible
there for you guys.
Also, if you happen to play over
140 hours...
Was this only online multiplayer?
This is only online multiplayer.
Halo 4 multiplayer... Matchmaking
or customer, does it say? It's multiplayer
over Xbox Live. So,
I could make a custom match,
set the timer to unlimited,
have it run all day,
have me and my friends set up a custom match
have the timer run all day, and I could do that, right?
If I wanted to be...
I don't know if they'd let you do that.
I mean, it would be a big waste of time,
but I guess I suppose you could do that.
Also,
I guess they're also doing...
It's going to be up to 800 Microsoft points.
So, I'm kind of confused to where they're going to get this
800 Microsoft points, I guess.
Oh, I'm sorry, the extra
200 is coming from spending
at least 3,000 Microsoft points on the
Halo Marketplace content.
Woohoo,
200 points back after spending...
So, it's like a dinky two-buck rebate.
Yeah, 3,000 Microsoft
points, which is the
equivalent of almost...
What is that?
40 bucks?
Almost?
I don't know.
All the point values are just...
It's annoying.
So, yeah, there you have it.
Some money back if you do that.
Oh, and I guess also if you...
If you spend,
I guess, 1,500 Microsoft points,
you get 100 Microsoft points back.
Fantastic, I guess.
But it is kind of neat, though, to see
that you can earn some Microsoft points
for playing a game for a long period of time.
YYR says it's more like a thank you
to the people who are going to do it anyway.
I think it's just trying to get people to play
a long time so that they can try to beat up
Black Ops 2, which is probably going to dominate
multiplayer, and they want
to have it look nice when
Halo 4 is at the top of the charts there, but
it's going to be tough.
And last but not least,
there's been a lot of information
regarding Grand Theft Auto 5 coming out.
All of this coming from the brand new issue
of Game Informer.
And a lot of details
regarding kind of the single player
campaign, including,
you know,
first off, the game's
map itself is going to be
over... It's going to be bigger
than Grand Theft Auto 4, San Andreas,
and Red Dead Redemption combined.
It's just the
largest map in any of the games
at all.
So, that's fantastic.
There's going to be three
different people that you get to play as.
Three different protagonists, including
let's see here,
I'm trying to remember the names of these guys.
I don't remember.
Well, anyways, that's not important.
But three different people you get to play as.
Also, they're going to have some different
locations available in the game.
Some of the stuff, obviously, you've seen in the
trailers, including
stuff based off of the
vineyard areas.
Obviously, Rockford Hills,
which is like Beverly Hills.
Blaine County, which is kind of like this
desert. They say they have bikers
and meth heads in there.
Oh, goodie! Vespucci Beach,
which is similar, I guess, to Venice Beach.
Also, some beach fronts
and stuff like that. They're saying also
the game's going to have
a Salton Sea region, a military base,
suburban hills.
There's a Mount Chiliad,
I guess, which is
a large wilderness area where you can
explore all that. They're also going to have
underwater areas that you can
scuba dive in and stuff like that.
They've got this
brand new engine that has
multi-mile draw distances
in there. I guess also, you're
going to be able to do all sorts of things
from, they have a golf course that you can play
a full round of golf in, if you really want to.
Wow.
All sorts of details.
As long as I can beat people with my clubs.
They have
bowling, strip clubs,
stand-up comedy acts, TV shows,
internet cafes, kind of all similar to
what they had before.
You can also, I guess,
go to the gym. You can attend a sermon.
They've got yoga, triathlons
that you can do, base jumping,
tennis, jet skiing.
Also, they're getting rid of
the romance stuff in there because
God was fucking annoying.
One of the things I thought was really cool about it, though, is
the three main characters,
when you're switching between them, they
go off on their own thing and do
whatever. They'll
go on their own business.
It zooms out of the map
like Google Earth, I guess, and then goes into
these different characters.
The three characters,
Michael, who I guess is
the guy who did the voiceover in the first trailer.
He's a retired bank robber, and
now he's kind of on the FIB,
the FBI
Witness Protection
Program.
He's
hiding out.
Also, there's a guy named Trevor,
who is this crazy meth
head, who
is this crazy
war veteran or whatever.
Franklin, who is a repo man.
It's kind of all them
coming together to
do these heists.
But,
lots of screenshots. Looks fantastic.
New trailer
is going to be coming out on the 14th this week.
Very excited
by that. This is definitely
a game I'm highly, highly
looking forward to. No fanboy involved.
No, no, not at all. It's the biggest game next year.
All right.
Some rapid fire news for me.
Gamefly's digital PC client
is now out. It was in beta for a while,
but it is now officially out.
You can download this if you're anybody.
You don't have to be a Gamefly subscriber to get it.
Anybody can have it. Over 1,500
Windows and Mac titles. This is sounding a little bit
like a commercial, but it's been around on the game
blogs. If you are
a member, you should be aware, because I know a lot
of you guys are. You can do the whole unlimited PC
play. It's pretty much GameTap.
In a way.
Except I don't think it's a lot of the classic games,
but more kind of like the games that are,
you know, they're not super old,
but they're old enough to not really be selling anymore.
Like, Saints Row 2 is
unlimited PC play. Right?
So, there you go.
Oh, apparently,
2K games giving
everybody who downloads the
client a free copy of Bioshock.
I don't know if that's still going, but it was going for a while.
It probably only was on the launch day. It's probably done now.
But still.
I could just play that on PS3.
That's true. Or, you know,
a lot of folks bought the collection on Steam
or what have you. Anyhow,
Xbox 360 USB data storage.
It was capped at 16 gigabytes.
I don't know if you know that for the USB storage.
They actually raised that.
In this recent update that happened, it wasn't
really out there, but it has been
increased to 32 gigabytes.
So, it has been
confirmed with Microsoft that this was
intentional. So, there
you go. That's great news for those folks
that need to make way for
data to install their Halo 4
They should just not have a cap.
Oh, I understand.
I understand they want to sell their overly expensive
hard drives for these systems,
but it shouldn't have a cap.
I mean, they're just selling these
laptop SATA drives
and charging a really
huge premium on that stuff when
I
understand you can use external drives to
supplement that, but only get 32 gigs of
pop, whereas you can get 2 terabyte
drive for half the price of like their
320 drive. So,
why even bother?
Well, in my last
story here for rapid fire news,
oh, you gotta love
porno inspired by video games.
Yes, Lollipop
Chainsaw is
inspiring a new porno in
Japan called Tia's Geek
Cosplay Fuck, and I
love that fuck is all in capital letters
with an exclamation point.
And she dresses up as some of the
various characters in Lollipop Chainsaw
including a giant chainsaw
and she cosplays
and presumably fucks.
Well, that is true.
It's all the same character,
it's just all of her alternate costumes from
the game, so if I remember
correctly,
and judging by the back picture
here, I don't think she dresses up
like anybody else. It's hard to tell because the
pictures are really small, but I do notice
that
it's definitely a lot of the alternate costumes.
Although, that one might be, no, no, no,
that's still...
Who cares? Naked chick dressing up.
Exactly. She's allowed to make some mistakes.
And she has a giant really weird looking chainsaw.
That has a heart at the end of it, but I guess that's
from the game.
So, there you go.
That chainsaw just looks really weird.
Cosplay Fuck!
Dark Sakura.
Try to follow that.
Well, I did get
Final Fuck 10 or X
or whatever.
Six mix.
Mental note. Ask Eddie about Dance Dance Fuck
next time he comes on the show.
Well,
a little girl named Maya
gets to play Legend of Zelda
The Wind Waker as a girl.
Basically,
her dad is developer Mike Hoy
who
basically hex-edited the game to
replace all of the dialogue to be feminine
in regards to Link's gender.
So, instead of
Swordman, it's Swordmane
and Milady instead of My Lad and Master.
And he's actually
put the disc image up that you can play.
And it's pretty
neat. I think that's nice.
So his daughter can have an adventure
that feels more believable
to a little girl. To be fair, he's not
actually putting up the disc image because that would be piracy,
but he's putting up the patch file that if you
find the disc image with a certain MD5
hash, you can patch it.
Lollipop Chainsaw stars a girl.
Just saying.
Yeah, and the game was also awful.
That game is almost porn only as it is.
It's pretty bad though, but it's just...
Yeah. How old will Josh have to be
before you let him play Lollipop Chainsaw?
I won't let him play it because it's really
terrible. I mean, it is a terrible
game. He doesn't get to play bad games.
Listen, if you're gonna waste your time on the game,
just go on the internet and watch porn because seriously
it's a better use of your time than playing this game.
I mean, this game is just
lame. Next story.
Yes. The Angry Video Game
Nerd. Now for anyone who's kept up with that Kickstarter,
you know, there was a Kickstarter to do
a movie, and there's a trailer up.
I watched it yesterday.
And I was like, really?
Ugh.
It looks like a bad 90s
comedy. I know, I'm gonna watch it just
for that. But, I don't know, there were some
parts that made me laugh, like the guy going,
Where the fuck is my arm?
Isn't that guy from something
because he looks like, he looks like,
was it the, um, the boss that they had
in one of the Mega Man games where he had like the,
you know, the tank body type thing?
I, maybe, I don't know.
Maybe he's supposed to be a really screwed
up American Dr. Wily. It looks cheesy
like that Gamers movie. Remember
there's a lot of people that thought that Gamers movie
was so awesome and then they made a sequel
to it for God knows what reason. It's probably
because they made a lot of money off of it.
But, yeah, it's,
whatever. It's supposed to be cheesy.
People buy it if, you know, or if it's
a Kickstarter, he's gonna make money from it.
Well, um, you know how before
we talked about Minecraft being used in schools?
Well, another game is being used in schools, and that's
Happy Action Theater. The big,
uh, double fine green screen
game, um, they're using it in
schools now to help kids with autism
since verbal language is difficult for
autistic kids, then, um,
they use it for different types of communication
and it's actually, they're getting some, uh,
significant results with it.
I think that's really cool. And
I'm dead.
Alright, let's get to the FUGL Question
of the Week.
It's right here.
Every week, we
ask a question on our fan communities on
Facebook and Google Plus.
Smoosh them together, you get FUGL.
So, uh, here it is.
Uh, in honor of the fact that we talked a lot about
music games tonight. Our show was
born of the music gaming community,
but we know we've picked up a variety of listeners
since our debut over ten years ago and
our shift to a general gaming show
several years ago. So what is your
current thoughts on music gaming?
Is that a genre of game you are into?
Do you think it was a fad that has faded with
the rise and fall of Guitar Hero in the States?
Or is the best yet to come?
Now, because our show is running a little long
tonight, I'm gonna keep this really short. I'm only
gonna read a few of these answers, but I really
encourage you guys to read the full responses
on our Google Plus community, Orange Lounge Radio,
and Facebook.com
slash Orange Lounge Radio. Uh, going
to Google Plus, I'm gonna read this one from
Redertainment. Like fashion music
and my exercise group, things run
in cycles. Music gaming will
have its comeback, then fizzle out,
then comeback, then fizzle out again.
However, ABBA is
forever. Preach.
Of course you like that one. Preach.
Of course I read that one.
How to get Rob to read your comment.
Uh, Nick M. replies
and said, Music is a way for us to all
express ourselves and tap
into those feel-good emotions.
So it really meshes with about any form
of entertainment. For this reason,
I believe the music genre
will continue to grow with gaming.
It will never die. Technology
innovations and creativity will allow
music-driven games to make a huge revival
leaving the best to come.
Those are some answers from our Google Plus
community. Let's do a couple from Facebook
over at Facebook.com
slash Orange Lounge Radio.
Uh, Matt J. replied and said,
I love music gaming still.
My rock band library has grown to
over 1700 songs and I'm playing
almost every day that I can
with a close group of friends. It's been
sad to see people leave the community, but I'm
still able to find new people I haven't played with.
While my enthusiasm has
died down significantly over the years,
I'm still very much involved because of the
social aspect, even online. There's
such a wonderful, but small, group of people
playing and it's such an enjoyable experience
to play along to old-time favorites
with friends or even to discover
new music.
Um, going on to some more
answers here. Oh, I want to hear from
this guy here, DJ Melvis.
Yay!
The popularity of music gaming now
compared to 10 years ago is really
night and day, or is nearly night and day.
What propelled the music gaming crowd then
was the gamer community, who propelled
it from a cult following to something
mainstream. Competitive tournaments,
video footage of said tourneys, it was
something people looked forward to and buzzed about.
Konami, in America,
failed to capitalize on that momentum and
assumed the fans would eat up anything they put out.
Instead of working with and cultivating
their fanbase, they turned a blind eye to them.
That ultimately killed a majority
of their following. Combine that with the demise
of arcade gaming in America, the tournament
scene died and the community grew further
apart. Rockband is pretty much
music gaming's last stand.
At least they nailed the whole microtransaction
process with DLC, and events
like UmLoud validate its popularity.
Go harmonics!
Good plug for UmLoud, by the way,
which is coming up real soon.
Tell me about it.
Um,
let's see, I'll do one more here from
Facebook. Again, I'm really sorry I'm limiting this
tonight, but we're just running long night.
Chiggers replies and says,
I've been saying the same thing.
I wonder, too, if they could do something like
trumpet smith or sitar smith.
I do think they need to somehow incorporate
music theory into some of the games, though, too.
Sure, it's fun to play some of your favorite
songs by memory, but you can't pick up the guitar
and read music and play something that's not on
the game. For the record, there has been
Sitar Hero. That was
a joke, though, right? That was on
the Austin Powers 3
website as a Flash game.
But it did exist.
Very interesting. Alright, so. Was it Austin Powers
3 or was it the, uh,
the Love Guru? It was the Love Guru,
that was right, yeah.
Everybody forgot about that game.
Everybody should forget about that movie.
So, there you go.
Quickly, I'll go around the room.
What's your current thoughts on music gaming?
I think it'll always
have a niche. We have to remember it didn't really
start with DDR or Beatmania.
It was dance aerobics.
But, you know, I think games,
especially in America, games like Parappa
the Rappa, and
I know I loved Bust a Move
or Bust a Groove or whatever they called it over here.
We need to totally break that out.
What? Oh, I know, but it was a great game.
So, I mean, I kind of
feel like there were games before, and there will still be
games in the future. I think
it, kind of like that originally, that first
comment I read where, like, it comes, it goes, it comes,
it goes. I think, um,
that's kind of how I feel. Loki, Dark Saga?
Now the Facts of Life theme is stuck in my head.
You take the good, you take the bad.
No.
Um, I
love music games, so I don't
really, I think it's gonna just
kind of, right now, coast along with
a lot of the dancing franchises with
Just Dance and Dance Central and that kind of stuff.
Um,
maybe with the new systems they'll find new
ways to kind of incorporate
whatever type of peripherals
that they have into it, like, you know, with
the Wii U tablet or something like that.
Um, I
just, you know, I hope it doesn't, I
assume it's just gonna keep, you know, staying around
for a while, because you still have, you know, a niche
audience that's really into it, and
sometimes that's all it takes is just a niche
audience, because, I mean, look at a lot of the Atlas
products and stuff like that that don't sell millions
of copies, and you have
dozens and dozens of sequels.
Alright, let's move on with some more
news, and then we'll get to the mailbag and
some quick calls tonight. So,
uh, Loki. Alright.
So, let's talk a little bit about
some really weird
patents, and
Microsoft has one now
that, it's basically this kind of
DRM system that's gonna use
a Kinect-like camera
to basically monitor
the number of users that are watching
a display of a certain performance
or content or whatever,
and, um,
basically, you know,
tracking the faces of those
viewers to see if they have appropriately
licensed it. So, for example,
I mean, it
sounds kind of stupid, but, like, let's say
I rented a movie or something like that,
and then I have to go to the bathroom
and I leave, that the movie would
stop or something because I'm no
longer in the room, and it's like, oh, shit, the person
that, you know,
registered this content is no longer in the
room. I mean, that sounds a little ridiculous,
but,
I mean, I don't know if this is
necessarily gonna be something that they do.
Um, you know,
mentions, I guess, gaming and gaming
media, also mobile devices.
Maybe my thought is that
it's like, you know, your computer
will lock, I mean, they have it right
now already with, like, some of those
biometric sensors and
stuff, but maybe it's something where your computer
will lock down if, like,
you know, it doesn't recognize you. Although
that's gonna suck if you get in a car accident and your face
gets defigured, but, you know,
I don't know. Or, you know, um, I know
a lot of the live listeners are complaining that the
OLR feed is going up, what did they say?
Uh, Raginator said, OLR is going
down faster and more frequently than
White House interns when Clinton was in office.
Well, you know, I like to,
uh, grow and shave a beard
pretty frequently as well.
I like having a beard,
but then I'll shave it when I have to do Rocky
or something, an onstage part that requires me to
shave it. So, you know,
how's that gonna pick that up?
I'm gonna put it this way. It's not that sophisticated.
It's basically looking at
facial geometry, like, you know,
the proportions between, you know, space
between your eyes. So the, you know, bone
structure and that kind of stuff. It's like, okay,
your face is this wide, your eyes are this far
apart. Yeah, but that technology's not gonna work.
That's the problem. The, you know,
the Kinect was supposed to do all this stuff
and it doesn't really work in
the real world. And who really likes signing
into Xbox Live
by staring at the Kinect for
like 30 seconds?
Or hitting A and signing
in, like, you know, right away?
I really hope this technology is only
being patented to harness it
so that nobody can ever use it.
That is my real true hope.
But I'm not gonna hold my breath.
We'll see.
We had news earlier in the year that
Nintendo Power was gonna be having its last
issue ever. And, uh,
guess what? PlayStation,
the official magazine, following right behind.
The holiday 2012
issue will be the last issue of the official,
or, excuse me, PlayStation, the
official magazine.
That is not long after Future
US, who also published Nintendo Power,
announced that shutdown.
So, uh, bye-bye.
Magazine's
going bye-bye. There's two.
Out the door.
It's unfortunate we don't have, like,
an iPad version
of it or something that lives on. I don't know.
Maybe. It makes me very
depressed because print is beautiful.
And ink smells good.
I know, but, well, what do you think
can be done to save this dying industry?
We still have Play, don't we?
I think so. I love that magazine.
Play better not go anywhere.
But, uh, what would, I mean,
do you think this is
something that could
make a renaissance someday, where we get,
or is this done because of technology?
Well, we got EGM again, right?
Is this just done because of tablets?
I know you don't like to think about it, but...
It's a shift.
Somebody's gotta design the tablet document
if we go there. It really is. The nature
of media is really
turning digital, which is good and bad.
I mean, I can
produce digital content.
The method's the same way.
I'm more worried about how stuff
like that is going to affect printers
and the print shops that rely
on having a steady client, a big
client, especially one like Sony, or not
Sony, but, you know, the magazine,
you know, it's
just gonna put a couple
more, you know, little nails in
while they're building that coffin.
What do you think about this comment from Dan Shadow
in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com?
No one reads, and the internet is full of pictures.
Speak
for yourself. Well, here's
something like, you know, the whole
shift from digital, or
from print to digital.
Game Informer has a digital
version. How did they get me
to switch over to the digital version
from print? The
Grand Theft Auto information came out this week on
the digital version, and two weeks later
on print. So I want
the digital version.
And so that's what it is.
It doesn't matter anyways. I thumbed through it once, and then
I put it aside, and then I throw
them away months later. Loki brings up a
good point. Is it that need-to-know-
right-now mentality, especially
in the gaming culture, that might be
hurting magazines a little bit? Well, yeah.
Here's the thing, too. It probably doesn't help.
All that Grand Theft Auto
information, immediately as soon as it hit
the digital version,
it hit the NeoGAF
forums, and then it hit all the
blogs, and it hit all the websites.
So even if you didn't subscribe to that magazine,
unless you wanted to read the article by
yourself, you got all the information that
was right there. To wait for
it to be in print is just ridiculous.
Why would you do that?
I mean, other than appreciating
the art of printing and all that stuff.
And pretty pictures to look at.
But now that you have digital versions,
there's really nothing that's exclusive
anymore to them, momentarily
at least.
Hell,
let's be honest. It took them a day
or two to get my digital version
converted over.
I looked at screen caps,
because you can do screen caps
on your iPod or iPhone
or on your iPad,
and I looked at screen caps
of the whole articles. I didn't even need the
digital version to read that stuff.
So,
yeah, it's like, it's
kind of, you know,
unless you have these exclusive articles
that are in your magazine, and you're not sharing
this stuff, you know, online, and even then,
when the print article comes out,
people are just going to post it on a forum, which is
going to get posted everywhere else.
It just, it moves too fast
for print.
Alright, let's move on to
Well, this is,
as soon as it works,
this is, um, an old
format that had a
game released in 2010.
Um, have you ever heard of
Pier Solar?
It was released in 2010 for the Sega Mega Drive,
or, as we know it, the Genesis,
and it's, uh,
like, a 64 megabyte
cartridge. It was huge.
And it was
very well received. Now, the
group Watermelon, the developer,
has a Kickstarter to release
an HD version to come out
for Xbox 360, PC, Mac,
Linux, and Dreamcast.
Um, the game already
has, uh, over 50 hours
of gameplay, 300 locations,
and 800 NPCs.
I actually watched
the, um, the little, uh,
interview on here, and it looks
pretty neat. There, um,
if you pledge $15, you'll receive
a copy of, uh,
the game when it's released
for whatever platform you wish, and $45
get a limited edition
4 CD copy of the soundtrack
or a digital bundle consisting of the game
on Xbox 360,
PC, Mac,
Linux, one of the three,
as well as a digital copy of the soundtrack.
There's also a limited edition for $125.
There's a hard copy of the game
for either Dreamcast or PC,
Mac, Linux,
and, um, the Pierce Solar
guidebook, signed, uh,
lithograph, and three figurines.
There's only going to be 250
of them, uh, produced,
and as of, uh,
when I was reading this, there were, uh,
just under a hundred pre-ordered. This actually
might be the first one I put money into.
The game looks awesome.
Um,
and, uh,
there were, uh,
the, uh, $999
Kickstarter
exclusive Dreamcast ones,
um, have already been
ordered, so,
they are currently at $76,468
out of their $139,000
goal.
And they have 26 days to go,
so I want this, and
I think everyone should check it out.
Bye.
Alright, just a few more stories,
then we'll get to the mailbag and the FUs of the week.
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com
Alright, so,
um, I think we talked about this
before, but there was some
whole controversy about
the Navy SEALs actually
helping the developers of
Medal of Honor Warfighter with some of the
details of the game and stuff like that,
and it probably doesn't help that they have
the whole DLC tying in with that movie
Zero Dark Thirty, which is about the whole,
you know, SEAL Team 6
infiltrating
Osama Bin Laden's camp and stuff like that.
So anyways,
apparently, um,
seven SEALs so far have received
letters of reprimand,
effectively denying them of
promotion and also
knocking off half their salaries for,
or docking them half their salaries for two months.
Which, you know, obviously they're
probably getting paid by EA anyways, but,
um,
but yeah, so, that's
I don't know, I guess
four of the seven affected
are still engaging in, um,
active duty and are still under investigation.
But, um,
that kind of sucks.
But then again, if you're in the military and you're
revealing military secrets to a game company,
it's
kind of a problem.
This is having some huge
ramifications, too. This is the type of thing
I'm hearing reported on CNN.
Yeah. You know? So.
Well, I mean, that's kind of like
even a breach of security as far as
national security.
You know, if you're talking like
tactics and stuff like that, that
your SEAL team deployed
to infiltrate, you know,
this compound and stuff, that's just
you're not supposed to be sharing
that stuff. Right. Right.
How historically
accurate is too historically accurate?
Especially when it's so
recent, you know? Yeah.
Well, moving on to something completely
different. Capcom is
apparently going to be hiring 1000
people. That's pretty cool.
1000 people over the course of 10
years. But that would be adding to the
1500 game developers that are on staff
currently. This is a
Capcom representative saying, quote,
we want to further improve the quality of our games
by maintaining an internal game development
team. The purpose of
increasing our game developer team is to create
a larger percentage of our games internally.
Therefore, we believe that there will be
no significant change in total development
expenditures, mainly because we will
be shifting outsourced operations to
our own workforce. That's
pretty neat because, you know, there's
a lot of that outsourcing that goes on in the gaming
industry as well. And, you know, for all the
Capcom is evil chats that go on
and, you know, certainly they've made some pretty shitty
decisions over the past couple of years. Let's be real.
This is
pretty cool that they are going to be bringing a lot
of jobs back.
Do notice, though, that that
doesn't necessarily mean it's a thousand jobs here.
It's probably a thousand jobs in Japan.
But, you know, still, more
internally developed games, I think, means they can
kind of keep a closer eye on things and hopefully
get some
better products. We'll see.
Interesting.
So,
Capcom. Sounds like they're almost
it's almost double, but not
quite. So.
All right. Well, let's get to our
mailbag segment.
Every week you guys send us emails
mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com
and we read some of our
favorites here on the air.
Dark Soccer, why don't you
dive into the mailbag head first and read some
emails for us. Just three.
Just three?
First of all, this one's a little
long, but I'll try to get through it quickly.
Hey, OLR, AZHP here. I heard you guys talk
about Rhode Island suing 38 Studios for
$75 million, basically assuming that Rhode Island was
in the right for lawsuit. It seemed like there
were some assumptions being made, so I wanted to clear up some
misconceptions. The lawsuit is
not as straightforward as 38 Studios didn't put out
a game and we want our money. 38 Studios
declared bankruptcy, which typically prevents
a company from being pursued by creditors, in this
case the state of Rhode Island. However, Rhode Island
suit claims that 38 Studios and Kurt
Schilling misled Rhode Island
as to the difficulties involved with putting
out an MMO, and because Rhode Island was
misled that $75 million was loaned in
poor trust and should be repaid.
There's another misconception I wanted to clear up.
Rhode Island approached 38 Studios
promising the $75 million
loan and tax breaks if 38 Studios
would move their operation to
Rhode Island in the first place. Basically, they
wanted 38 Studios to come to Rhode Island.
This is basically like a bank saying,
hey, we'll give you a good deal on a
loan to buy a house, lending you the money,
you losing your job, going bankrupt and foreclosing
due to unforeseen circumstances, and the bank saying
whoa, whoa, whoa, you didn't tell me there was a possibility
you would lose your job. We want our money back.
We're going to take your house.
So as you guys can see, it's not as
clear cut that Rhode Island deserves any money
at all. If you make an investment and it
doesn't pay off, in my opinion, you should go suck it up
and take your lumps. But try telling that to
the governor of Rhode Island. Just my two cents on the matter
is HP OLR's premier gold star
recipient. You know, I think that's a
good point that he brings up, is that, you know,
Rhode Island did, and I thought we kind of
touched on this a little bit last week because,
and I'm going to say it again now,
why was it so goddamn important
that they get this guy in the first place?
You know, and I remember I mentioned last week,
were we blinded by our sports culture?
Where we hold these sportsmen
that do so well in such high regard.
You know,
was that really Rhode Island's mistake
possibly? And yeah,
if that was their mistake, then they in turn need
to pay for that. You know, I don't know.
But like some of our chatters were
saying last week, you know, I say all this,
you know, and I know it sounds really
cold and really mean, and then I'm like anti-
sport. I'm not. I'm not any of those things.
I am. I'm kidding.
And I think
Curt Schilling and all them meant
well, but
you know, I would like
to do a lot of things. Are you going to give
me 75 million dollars because I mean well
and I have good intentions and some real good ideas?
Probably not.
You're going to expect to see some things.
You know, I just, I
I just think
the celebrity of it all
is what's really to blame at the end of the day.
But, anyhow.
Next one is
and I'm going to save the biggest
for last, so. Next one
is just a quick update on a game I talked about
last time I emailed.
And this comes from Catastrophic Moggy, by the way.
It's Persona 4 Arena
will not make it to Europe this year.
I heard about that. You guys got screwed
because that's the region locked one, huh?
That is so messed up. And people wondered
why we bitched about it being region locked.
I was a pretty big Shin Megami Tensei fan.
I was really looking forward
to this game and we still have no idea
when it will be released. Only that it won't be
this year. Sigh.
Excuse me.
You guys got hosed.
That's really unfortunate.
I really don't know what
else to say except that, you know,
I wouldn't fault you for
pirating it at that point.
I'm not supposed to encourage that.
You can't really if it's region locked.
Are you suggesting
that people can't work around that?
Well, you can, but you need
a J-Tech system on Xbox 360
or a recent glitch hack system.
That's what I thought.
And the last email
comes from your boyfriend.
Loki's boyfriend?
No.
Yes, Loki's boyfriend.
That was too easy.
Hi, Alan.
I know you don't. Hi, Alan.
This question is for Dr. Sakurai
and it's related to Mass Effect.
So the upcoming
Omega DLC looks pretty rad, but starting
with ME3 proper, Bioware
made some really glaring weird sexist mistakes
both in Fem Shep's handling
as well as her relationship soiling
Kayden for a lot of shippers who don't give a fuck
about Dude Shep. Me included.
Thanks to this,
many in the fandom have joked that the female
versions of Mass Effect aliens will end up
being male face plus bad perm plus
stock tits armor.
My question is, how do you feel
about Nereen having proper
separated breasts in screenshots
instead of just a larger breastplate region
in her robe, considering that Turians are
clearly supposed to be avian, reptilian, or both?
I'm not asking if you're offended
personally, though if you are, let it out,
but from a design perspective, since
they otherwise did a good job on her face
and had detailing. And that's from Alan.
First of all,
I actually didn't notice she had boobs.
I thought she just had plating.
Or maybe like a
kind of segmented chest plate type of thing.
Because, and I
didn't even really look, think to look
because of cut dialogue
in Mass Effect 2.
And that's what I linked to you earlier.
That I wanted to play.
Oh, yeah, sure.
You're like looking at me like
what? Yes, yes,
keep talking. Alright, hold on, what am I playing
here? It's the groundskeeper
on the Citadel in Mass Effect
2.
Good evening
human. It is evening
isn't it? Without day and night
I lose track.
I shipped in from Pallavin last month.
I'm still getting my bearings.
You'd be surprised how much a trained
horticulturalist can earn here.
The nicest thing about being on the Citadel
has to be the drinks.
You might not believe it, but my
species hasn't invented many
intoxicants. I'm constantly
amazed by human creativity
when it comes to brewing and distilling.
Ever had aquarian thruster
fuel? Must be 99%
alcohol. I think they
distill it from raw antimatter.
Antimatter alcohol.
Excuse me for asking, but
you're a female, right?
You got those funny bumps.
Like an asari. Every time I come
in here some asari asks me to dance.
First of all, turians don't
dance. Second of all, asari
have those funny bumps that get
in the way.
That's what I was trying to get to.
That was cut
dialogue. Basically, you know where
you go talk to him after the croak and ask if
there's fish in the reservoir?
That was cut dialogue for
him. You got some funny bumps, Dark
Sakura. Shut up.
Those are some big bumps.
Shut
up.
You know, I actually did have a kitten stand on
my boobs yesterday. Did you?
My friend drove me to PetSmart and I
was close to throwing down 60 bucks for this kitten
because it reminds me of Shermy, but
that wouldn't be fair to Shermy's memory.
But yeah, the kitten passed the standing on boobs test.
Just stood there and then
curled up and purred. Like, okay. I'll have to hold you.
But yeah, back to
Mass Effect.
So I actually didn't even look, and I have
some of the comics.
I didn't read some of the
I looked at pictures of what the female
turians looked like
in some of those comics and
I had the
Yeah, oh my god.
I'm sorry for
She
doesn't look like super endowed.
Yeah, it's not like overly sexualized.
I think is important to keep in mind.
It's not like she's got some tig old biddies.
You know, it's just like, okay, she's got some
funny bumps. That's it.
It looks like it
I mean, they kind of look
flattish. Like, more like an extended ribcage.
Yeah. Like a, well I mean
in general, I think turian ribcage is supposed to be
really high if you ever looked at the naked model.
It's a fucking alien race. Why are we
so, like
in a fake video game, it's a fake
alien race. Like, why are we so like, oh, but
it's not lizard accurate. Well, it's not a
fucking lizard. Those are the worst
press I've seen on lizard yet.
Well, I mean, my point was
it's not something I noticed because
first of all, I didn't really see evidence of it
in the comics. And there was
that cut dialogue. I didn't think to look
for boobs. You know,
I was like, okay, turian chicks don't
have boobs. Good for them. They
probably regurgitate to feed their
young. If they're based off of birds or
lizards, then that's kind of gross, but
Alan is in our chat room right now and
says, it's more of an issue that they are hard
and rough and scaly, but suddenly
soft jubilees. How do you know
those aren't some rough, scaly boobs?
How do you know they're not all like, how do you know
those aren't the slimiest tits you'll ever see?
Remember Morden and his chafing?
We'll prescribe analgesics.
May cause chafing.
But, um,
but, um,
I think that it's not
so much of a big deal. I think
I may
feel differently when I actually play it
and see them in action,
see if they bounce. But
it didn't look like boob boobs, you
know? It just looked like
a hint of boob.
Alan in chat is apologizing. Sorry
I asked. I thought it was interesting. No, it is
I'm yelling at the internet.
I'm not yelling at you. I would never
yell at you. I cannot wait, by the way, to
play through Omega with FemShep.
With Team Badass Bitch.
Cause Aria
and Nereen.
Yeah, Omega has one rule.
Don't fuck with Aria.
That's my rule too. Don't
fuck with me.
Good times.
Yeah, and Tigerclaw is right. Javok
did call Solarian's lizard
people and also said that
raw Solarian liver
is a delicacy.
And that they used to eat flies.
Alright, let's get, is that it for emails?
Yes, it is. Let's get to the FUs
of the week. Every week we rant
on this show because we can.
This is bad.
Here is justice. Here is punishment.
Don't care.
This is fucked up.
I have a huge FU that goes
to a condition called angular
calitis.
Which some people can use
for cold source or canker source.
What they are is when you get a lesion
in the corner of your mouth
that forms kind of a pussy scab.
And it happens to lots of people.
But the thing that I hate about it
you know, yeah this happened. It happens
from a vitamin deficiency
and basically a lot of stress.
But
what I hate is waking up in the morning
and having to yawn and forgetting all about it
and then just it hurt really badly.
And also drivers
in the parking lot and Whole Foods
you know, screw all you entitled rich people.
Loki.
Fuck you to Ford in my car.
He's breaking.
Like, I had the last
last time I took it in to get repaired
which you know was about $1200 for the repairs
I think. You know, he took a bunch of stuff
and then broke down a month later.
The guy there who had this
really weird growth on his face
said, oh yeah I've seen
those cars last for
300,000 miles. Yeah, after you replace
every goddamn part in the car
four times
it's probably lasted that long.
But then again, it's not the original car
anymore now is it?
That's it.
If you want to know my FU of the week, refer to the top of the show.
It was kind of a shitty weekend.
I don't want to go back to work tomorrow.
Wham.
But I guess we have to be funny.
Alright, a couple more
news stories for you guys and then we'll open up the
Skype line quickly at 1877 Game OLR.
I emphasize quickly, we might only do
one or two calls tonight depending on who
all tries to get in. And of course
Twitter topics, we'll get through as many of those as we can.
Twitter.com slash OLR. Loki.
So, Silicon Knights, you remember they were
suing Epic Games
over the whole, you know,
oh Unreal 3 is so hard
to use.
And they made our game shit.
Not because we suck or anything.
But they lost.
Boop.
So on top of that,
not only did they lose
but the new ruling
I guess doubled the damages
from 4.5 million to
9 million. And on top
of that they also have to destroy
any games that they
have, any
unsold games that they have
using the Unreal 3 engine.
So,
I don't know.
So I guess that means
two human
X-Men, Destiny,
Siren in Maelstorm,
The Sandman, and The Box
slash Ritualus.
All these games I was
a really big fan of.
So if they're destroying all these games
would that mean that they have to con-
They're going in a landfill.
By destroying, does that mean that they just
get to work on them a little bit longer?
Yeah.
That's what you get
when you place the blame on somebody else.
When, you know, really it was just your
inability to program these games.
Alright, well one more story for you guys.
Then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1877
Game OLR or our username on
Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. This is
a story about Charles Hwang.
If you don't know that name you probably know
something he co-created. It's Guitar Hero.
Well what's he doing now?
Is he doing another music game or doing
something else with gaming?
Not exactly.
It's called Green Throttle Games
is the company
he's working on.
It's a mobile to TV app and
controller. What it's trying to do is turning
smartphone games into a
big screen experience by connecting
a mobile device directly to an
HDTV. This would be
playable on wireless, Bluetooth controllers
via what's called the Green
Throttle Arena app.
In other words, you know,
I think it's a great idea but
Apple could knock this out of business in a
heartbeat. It's a dangerous territory
I think. There's a lot of people have been saying
Apple TV is only
moments away from doing something like this.
I don't know.
That's all fan wank and Apple hasn't
done it. My only issue with this
and great for him to
do something like this but
you can do this with any Bluetooth controller.
Seriously, you take a Bluetooth
controller, you pair it with
your phone or device,
you get the TV out cable
hook it up to your TV via
HDMI. Boom. You have
exactly what he's selling.
Except, you know, now they're going to have all these
apps that are within this other app
that are basically going to all support
this device.
But you can do that right now
with any controller. In fact,
you can not only do it with any controller, you can
do it with a controller you already have. Like
a DualShock 3 controller or
a Wii U or
a Wii Remote
with the Classic Controller Pro
or something like that tied in with it.
They have a lot of games that do support these things
and with a TV out
cable
you can do this already. But
they're wrapping in a nice package I guess
so that, you know, it's easy for consumers
to find all the games that support this controller.
And it's important to note they are also
developing their own games in house.
So, you know, even if Apple were to
push a button and really fuck this idea
over, they'd still have, hopefully, some
solid games to fall back on.
I'm surprised they haven't done anything like that.
And, to be fair, I want to throw this out here
to give this whole thing a break
because I don't want to sound like I'm poo-pooing the idea
because I'm not. I would love
to be able to play smartphone games on the TV.
There's a lot I would like to be able to do that with.
Um,
but, um,
oh, that's my train of thought. Where was I going with this?
The, um,
Radio Guy's Worst Enemy
Derailed Train
I think a lot of the games, also, it seems like
a lot of them are touch-based. Well, not necessarily
the games that they're pitching, but like, um,
you know, like Angry Birds or something like that.
I don't know what I was going to say.
Open Faint is like an Apple,
or is an iOS
thing that a lot of gaming, you know, companies
use to plug into their games to do online
leaderboards and so forth. Game Center
hasn't put that out of business because
Open Faint, I guess, offers
either it's easier to implement or it's a richer
package. Multi-platform.
Multi-platform as well and so forth.
So, you know, who knows?
Green Throttle could go multi-platform too, I would think.
Hypothetically, you know,
with Android tablets or whatever. I don't think even if
they did something like that where, you know,
Apple TV or whatever had
some sort of Bluetooth support, which
I, honestly,
I'm surprised that that device doesn't have
Bluetooth support, you know, the whole Apple TV.
You know, what they could do,
which would be interesting, is have
if you have an Apple TV,
because doesn't the Apple TV support
like streaming, like you can content
stream stuff from your iPod
or iPad to
the TV. Maybe say you
content stream something to
the TV and then you use a Bluetooth
controller with that and then you can
basically use the
iPad or
iPod or iPhone device
as like a tether, almost like, you know,
using the Wii
Classic Controller,
Classic Controller Pro with the Wii.
You have to use the Wii Remote as kind of like
the Bluetooth tether to that.
Alright, well, we're
going to move on to the Skype line. 1877
Game OLR or our username
on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. It is open
for business now. In the meantime,
we'll get some last minute stories
and I want to do some Twitter topics
as well. Things that were sent into
twitter.com slash
OLR. I want
to do this one first. This is from
dammit, come on, load.
Here we go. This one's from
actdeft. Give a listen
to the Wii U menu music.
It's really good and entrancing.
I did not know that this was
out, but apparently here it is.
Here's the thing though.
I want to go into skeptic mode here because
I noticed that the YouTube here
has a link to a website where it says
full album available and
then it says check out more Wii U music
and news at such and such website and
it's not an official Nintendo site either.
Now I'm not saying maybe these guys didn't get a Wii U
but I'm always kind of curious
when it's this much blatant
like go here, go to this site.
I don't know. I'm just saying.
I'm just saying.
Could be legit.
What do you think?
Is this it? Is this the real deal?
It sounds pretty Nintendo-y.
It does sound a little pretty Nintendo-y. I believe it.
Yeah, I'm not sure.
We'll know within days
because those things
are going to be out very, very,
very soon.
Uh, let's go to phones.
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?
Hey, so we're Nate. How's it going?
Hey, good. How are you, Nate?
Going good. Listen to all y'all
talks about vaporware and
green throttle and Wii U music.
Yeah.
I just wanted to ask you all
who do you think is going to win the upcoming console war?
Who's going to win the upcoming console war?
And to answer your question
whether that was legit or not, yes, it is.
We actually have more menu music.
Because Kotaku, they were reviewing
they have their own Wii U thing
and they wouldn't post a story like that if it was completely
wrong, you know, because they have a Wii U
to compare that to.
Ah, I see. Okay, thank you for that clarification.
I'm always a little skeptical when it's the internet.
Alright, so Nate's
loaded question. No, I'm kidding.
It's not a loaded question. It's a tough question.
Who's going to win the upcoming console war?
Nate, I think it's too damn early to tell.
And I think you only have one console.
Well, here's the thing
because we don't know what
PlayStation 4 and what the new
Xbox have under their belt.
We're not
really going to know that until E3.
Right now we have to also
evaluate, you know, how is the Wii U
going to do? We're hearing
about sellouts and pre-order
stuff and that they're hard to get
but how much
of that is legitimately
everybody wants them in demand and how much of that
is Nintendo is slowly
like a faucet
drip letting these consoles out
to create that artificial
demand. Well, I'm going to tell you
right now who's going to win the whole console wars
here and it's going to come out of left field
here. It's the GE Micro Box
microwave slash
console.
Because we're talking about the future and no one knows what the
future is, that's what's going to win. Microwave console.
Okay, another question.
Alright.
Okay, so I'll
hear you all talking about Green Throttle.
If you
have to pick between Green Throttle and
Ouya, who would you vote for?
Oh, damn.
That's a pretty good question because I don't really
know enough about Green Throttle
yet.
Based on presentation
and power and
fame, glory, money.
I'm going to have to go Ouya.
Only reason because it's an actual console
versus basically
Green Throttle is just, okay, we have a controller
that's paired with some games that we're making.
But it doesn't have any hardware platform
that it's meant for. They don't have like their
own Android device or something.
So you're going to get varied performance depending
on what kind of Android device that you have.
So that's the only problem there is it's
not a standardized platform. Whereas the
Ouya is actually going to be a
device that they make games for that they know will
run well on that platform.
I'm going to say the Ouya as well because
again, I'm a little concerned about
Apple could really
knock this Green Throttle thing down a
few pegs by doing their own thing.
Whereas the Ouya is going to be a little tougher.
I think the Ouya is kind of trying to beat Apple
at it's own game in a way.
I think it's a little different. So I'm going to
go Ouya as well.
Okay, last question.
What
game are you giving
the best game to come out
between now
and summer?
Now and summer. So of all these games
that got pushed back to 2013
that make up the first and second
quarter releases, what's going to be the best game
to come out? I'm going to say Mass Effect Trilogy
on PS3.
No, no, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
I am really
looking forward to the Tomb Raider
reboot. That's not coming out before
summer. Oh, get out.
I thought it was pushed back to like March.
Yeah, yeah, go look that up in your
Funkin' Wagonals.
I'm looking forward
to Omega. Omega
DLC, Mass Effect. Are there any games?
Come on. Oh! Omega.
I don't know if it'll make summer, Nate,
but the Final Fantasy XIV
Realm Reborn. No, that's fall next year.
I'm damn curious about that.
Okay, awesome.
Okay, I'll get off your Skype line.
I think other people might want to call in.
That's alright, buddy. Clearly the
correct answer is Grand Theft Auto V.
I was going to say, I'm not even going to ask Loki
because I know the answer is Grand Theft Auto V.
So there you go, a wide variety of answers.
With a close second being Bioshock Infinite.
Oh, yeah, that's going to be a win, too.
Well, Nate, I'm going to turn the tables on you.
I got a question for you.
Um, I don't, I don't give questions.
But, yes.
Ask away.
Alright, you've asked us about
console wars and what we're looking
forward to and all this stuff.
What do you want to see happen in gaming
in 2013?
Okay, so,
um, I'm just going to be a little
vague because there's other things I could talk
about but I want to talk about now.
Um, I would like to see,
um, the rise
of indie gaming and also, um,
like, far less
social games and all these, like, small,
like, touchscreen games.
I would like to see less of in 2013.
Alright, so you want to see
indie games come up, but you want to see social
games go away. I got to tell you, though, buddy,
that's where a lot of indies get their start
right now is on iPhone and all that stuff.
Are you okay with the mobile games?
Um, I don't have a
smartphone, so that's, that's like
a no. So, so
screw everybody else.
Um, I'm a consoleer, PCer,
um,
I try to play Angry Birds, but that's
PC. That's, you know what, there's
indie, of course, has a huge
life on PC and lots of great indie stuff
gets their start on PC, so, and
I'm with you. I'd like to see some more
indie games make it big. You know, uh,
the best games to come, we probably
don't even know about yet. Think about that.
Alright, Nate, thank you
for the questions. We appreciate it. Have a
good one, buddy, okay? Alright, talk to you later.
Alright, you too. Bye.
See, I like that. I like the whole
you're gonna ask me questions? Oh, yeah, buddy,
I got a question for you.
Our job sucks,
huh? No, I'm kidding. No, I loved it.
I love getting questions. 1877
Game OLR, or our username on
Skype. Orange Lounge Radio!
Let's go to the phones.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?
Legend Zaku here. Zaku, you must have
loved that interview tonight.
Huh? Did you, did you hear our interview
with Eddie tonight?
Um, yeah, yeah, definitely. I, I
just caught, like, the, I guess, the tail end
of it. Oh. After, like, watching
Walking Dead. For, oh, oh, oh,
we got, we got shafted for walking.
I, I, I hear it through the show. I'm sorry, but
that's kind of, like, religion here.
We don't, we don't have blood and guts and
zombies yet. I had a stein full of, like, beer ready to go
and my snacks. But, yeah,
um, I guess
this is probably gonna be out of the ordinary, but
I've had this, uh,
this thing that, had, like,
my Steam collection that I've been wanting to,
like, wrangle down because I've, like,
gotten so many games that I have a
backlog. It's created,
created such a backlog that I'm not sure
how to actually systematically
approach having to tackle
all these games that I have. I'm gonna post it right
now in the chat room.
And I'm just, like,
like, I have some of them already. I'm putting
time on them, but there's still,
there's still plenty, like, that I just bought
because they were cheap at that point and I just got them
for the sake of getting them. But now
it's, like, I don't know,
like, I'm, like, preventing myself from getting games
because of, because it's gonna add,
it's gonna add more fuel to the fire.
Well, you're doing the right thing by investing
99 hours in Skyrim.
52 hours Team 76, Battlefield
Bad Company. Alright, you got your priorities
right. I'm just trying to see if there's a game
you're not playing enough.
Okay, Torchlight? What's up with this?
Less than an hour on Torchlight. You gotta fix that, buddy.
Um, I have put in more time,
but that was on my Mac.
And that was, that was when I was heading
down, you know,
when I was heading down to Otacon on the train and I
didn't even have, like, a connection, so I was playing offline.
So that count,
that time didn't get counted for yet.
Uh, you would make Allen
a very sad puppy with all these Half-Life
games you own that you haven't even played yet.
I know, I know, I'm guilty
of that. Alright. And I'm also in
between, like, Battlefield 3
and Hawks, which is, like, crapping out on me,
so I had to switch up to other games. And, uh,
Loki, look at this.
Loki, look, look, look what he's got here,
sitting in his collection untouched. Right there,
you see that? Grand Theft Auto 4
and episodes from Liberty City. What do you have to
say about that? Probably got him really cheap.
Yes.
You can do that.
You know what, if I were to show you my Steam
collection and you were to rate me on that same scale,
you would be like, Rob, I'm taking that
podcast away from you, so you have time to go play these games.
Dude, I've got so many indie games that I've
bought from all these Humble bundles that I have
never played. We're sitting here hazing
you on all the stuff you haven't played, but we are
the worst when it comes to this
stuff. So, you know what, buddy?
It's all good. At least you're, uh,
supporting these developers.
Alright, one more
thing. Seeing that Black Friday
and the holiday shopping season is upon us,
I'm kind of at a crossroads
where, like, I don't know what
else to invest on my 360 that
isn't already out on PC and isn't already
on another platform. Like,
every time I go to GameStop or any video
game store, I'm always hard, I'm always
pressed as to trying to find something
that, A, obviously isn't
PC or on a PS3, and
B, isn't, like, a first-person shooter.
So it's kind of like finding those,
like, that small scope of
console exclusives
that I can't really play that I wouldn't
normally otherwise play on another platform.
Honestly, Zaku,
if Xbox Live isn't doing it for you
and the community on there, and, um,
you know, the indie games and some of the stuff that
you can download on Xbox, uh,
and all that, maybe you should
think about offloading your Xbox, because
yeah, when it comes to exclusives, you know,
Microsoft's got, you know,
again, there's Kinect. A PS3 is
definitely, yeah, I know, I
understand that, you know, I'm kind of
contemplating it, but on the
other hand, I am
long overdue for a PS3. Let's
just say that my girlfriend was hinting at
trying to avoid, you know, telling me to avoid
getting one in the next couple of
weeks, so I pretty much, I can
pretty much say with certainty that she's
probably hinting towards getting me,
you know, something like that.
What a nice girl. So, I might be able to
exploit that
avenue in terms of playing the
PS3 exclusives that I missed
out on, like Gran Turismo 5,
the Uncharted series, uh, Metal Gear Solid
4. No, Gran Turismo 5 never came out.
Did?
It's a running joke.
That's not what Bobby said.
That's not what Bobby said.
It did, but it's like,
yeah, it's kind of like that
red-headed stepchild, but I mean,
with GT5, I could plug in, like,
a high-end racing wheel.
I wouldn't be able to do a Forza,
for example, since it's like,
I'm not going to play with some virtual,
like, wireless wheel that I have to
pretend like doing air steering,
which I have, which is garbage.
You don't have to do air steering with Forza, though.
Forza, I, you know, I,
Bobby was very kind to Forza, and he wrote
the review on vognetwork.com, and
I know Actif's a big fan of it as well. I
played the demo. I liked it, but
I just spent $120 on
games this week, so I won't be picking up Forza
anytime soon, but I'm interested in it. Forza's
pretty good for what it's worth on
the 360, but in terms of actually,
like, for a hardcore game, you know, for
a hardcore racing gamer
who wants to, like, plug in their Logitech
G27 in there, which is not
even possible because it only supports PC
and PS3, I'm only,
you know, I'm basically, like,
forced to buy their,
like, you know, their bullshit
wireless wheel that
is just like, it's just like a yoke
shaped thing that just,
you could just, like, hold it up and just
stare, and it basically does it for you,
but it's not cutting it, because it's
like, I want to have that feel
and the shock of actually, um,
driving a car, shifting the
gears, and so
forth. Then go out and drive a car.
Well, drive a car
at high speeds without getting pulled over,
sure, sure.
Sure, buddy. It's worth a shot.
Go to Montana, ain't no one care out there.
Alright, Saku, I gotta let you go so we
can wrap up the show, maybe get one more call, alright?
Alright. Take care. Have a good one.
Bye, you too.
Alright, 1877 Game OLR, our
username on Skype is OrangeLaunchRadio. I
suppose we have time for one more
call, but I want to do some more of these tweets
here real quick, and then I'll let
Loki do last minute stories. Uh, TigerClaw
is sending us a couple tweets. I remember
reading about this one, and for some reason, they
make our show roll, but getting it out there,
what, uh, TigerClaw linked us to on
GamePolitics.com. Capcom
can no longer make new Tatsunoko
games. If you do not own
the Tatsunoko versus Capcom game,
uh, you better hurry up and find
it in a bargain bin somewhere, because Capcom
no longer holds the rights
to publish Tatsunoko games.
That was a limited deal, so,
uh, if you're hoping-
I have mine.
If you're hoping for a part two,
keep right on hoping.
This is really interesting. TigerClaw
linked into another story on, uh,
uh, Twitter.
I almost said Skype.
He didn't link on Skype, he linked on Twitter.
Foxconn rumored to be planning
US plants?
Isn't Foxconn that company in China
that all those controversial stories-
Is this a Goodwill thing, or, or
what is this? But, yeah.
Apparently, uh, they are evaluating Detroit
and LA for new operations.
Um, this is, uh-
Is there outsourcing here? Are we cheaper
labor? I- Hold on, I'll get back
to the story in a minute, but we got one more,
one more call coming in. I'll take this call, and then we'll go back to the story.
Hi, you're on Orange Honest Radio. Who's this?
Hey, this is Act Deft.
Act Deft? What's on your mind, buddy?
Well, I want to talk about
Forza Horizon 2.
Something that Zaku said.
Uh-oh. Alright, what'd you want to say in response
to what Zaku said?
Uh, he says, uh, Forza
isn't, or, Forza Horizon
isn't made for, uh,
well, playing with, playing
it with a, with a real controller,
er, racing controller. Mm-hmm.
And he's pretty wrong on that.
He's wrong? You're calling him out?
Why is he wrong?
Well, basically, uh, one of the, one of my
friends I play, uh, Forza,
uh, frequently with,
he has a fantastic controller,
and those controllers are, like, really
expensive, uh,
they have a lot of, uh, stuff
that, that makes it, makes
it feel like a li-, uh, you're driving
a real car, so,
uh, basically, you can,
uh, play, uh, play,
sorry, or, uh,
play with a real controller,
a good controller, uh, even though
it, it does feel different,
from, uh, even from Forza
4, but
you can still play it.
Now, Zaku in chat is, is clarifying,
I didn't bash Forza Horizon,
Forza 4 sucked ass on the 360
wireless steering wheel. Well, that's...
Well, that's different. I, I, I don't know
about the, the 360 controller,
but you can play. Yeah, Forza Horizon,
the demo played alright to me. I liked
that it, it was really stupid
proof, like, the demo was really stupid
proof, like, I played on Easy, and it was like,
here, let me break the car
for you. It's like having a driving instructor
sitting right next to you. I'm like, oh,
this is what I needed to be able to play Forza,
this is great. I'm totally,
I am being totally honest.
Well, uh, I have played,
uh, since Forza 2, and I,
and I loved it because
it's so easy to pretty much pick
up and play, even though, uh,
it does, uh, get harder on
later races for the
difficulty. Sure. It's pretty much
easy to play because you have
so much things, uh, that help
the, the driver, the
player, that
you can much, uh, pretty,
uh, pretty much screw up a race and
even though, uh,
the game will help you to correct
that and be a better player.
So, you, you give,
uh, Forza Horizon your stamp of approval
as well. I know I saw Bobby gave it a good review on
the site. Did you give it a good review too?
Yeah, I pretty much
gave, uh, the same points as
Bobby, even though, uh,
the difficulty in Forza Horizon can be
pretty unforgiving,
but it's still a great game.
Uh, even single player or
multiplayer, it's really good.
Alright. And, uh, it looks like they
just want to clarify one more thing. Not bashing the
game, says Black Wolf. He's bashing Microsoft's
controller standards.
No, I know. I know, but
like I said, if you have a good controller,
it will work. Yeah, 360 does have some,
some, uh, that controller does leave some things
to be desired, especially when it comes to that D-pad.
Alright, act deft. I'm going to let you go
so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much, buddy. Okay?
Thank you. Alright, take care.
Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.
I'm going to close it up because we are running a little
long. I want to finish up Twitter and
then I'll let, uh, uh, Loki do any last
minute stories or Jamie. Um,
uh, that Foxconn story, let's see,
it's a Digitimes report saying that
Foxconn Electronics plans to set up
manufacturing plants in the US, looking
at Detroit and Los Angeles.
Uh, market watchers are the source of
the news. Uh, these facilities
would be expected to handle LCD
TV manufacturing. It's a
simpler and more automated process.
So, um,
It requires a lot less suicide.
Stop it.
Take that with a gigantic grain of
salt, but there you go.
Um, one other tweet I want to read
here is from Spazinator PSN on
Twitter. Sky, I'm challenging
to top some of my high
scores in Game Room.
Yes, I said Game Room.
What? What's that? We're going to party like it's 2010.
Woo! What's a Game Room?
He's talking about Microsoft Game Room.
You know, I haven't touched Game Room in a while
and I should. I'm
going to go back and, and
I'll go back and, you know, I did spend money
on a lot of those games and a lot more
than I really should be admitting. So I do
need to go back and show Spazinator
how it's done. So, uh,
fine. Challenge accepted.
Probably be able to set some high scores because
no one plays it anymore. Challenge accepted!
Loki, any last
minute stories? Uh, just a couple.
There was a comment about
Minecraft. They
were, um, basically saying that
the future of Minecraft is
the consumer. And the reason that is
is because one of the things that they're working on is
the whole new mod
interface that
they're going to allow people to be able to
mod Minecraft a lot easier.
Because right now it's a little bit difficult. You kind
of have to replace files in the jar file
and stuff like that and it's just not
user friendly. But they are
working on new framework that's going to allow
the creating and installing of mods to
be easier and also, um,
releasing an official editing suite.
Also, they're thinking about
hosting their own private servers so that they
can have groups of people to build
their own persistent worlds and
experiment.
So that's kind of neat.
And then there was another comment.
Ubisoft wants to get
their full retail
games onto the Wii
U eShop
as soon as possible.
I can understand why because they
had a good portion of the games for the
Vita launch and I bet a lot of those sold digitally.
Yeah, when there's nothing
else to buy, your games look pretty appealing.
They have a lot of games.
Push button, get game.
You never even have to hand anybody money.
Of course, the problem with downloading the games
is remember you need to have
storage space which, uh,
you know, really, you're only going to be able to
get about one or two games on the
premium
model there. You're going to need an external hard drive
and it's
an extra step. I understand it's not
necessarily an expensive step but
it's still an extra step to have
a hard drive to
put those games
on.
That's it.
Alright. Well that does it.
It's almost a three and a half hour show
tonight. Well it helps that we
actually get to play the break tonight so
it helps give more
content on the podcast and
something for the worker bees who listen to our show on
Mondays and Tuesdays and throughout the week.
Something to listen to. I really want to
thank you all for tuning in tonight. I want to
thank Eddie for coming on the show and staying
for 45 minutes, close to
much more than the 15 to 20
I told him it would be. So big thanks to him
for coming out tonight. BimaniStyle.com
I want to thank Jen
from Girl Gamer Vogue for doing
that interview with DJ Rama S as well. It was great
to meet her through Rama
and I want to thank my
co-hosts for being here tonight too.
You're welcome.
I want to thank myself for being
here. Thank you Rob. Thank you
Rob because if it weren't for you I wouldn't be
here tonight. I wasn't even
supposed to be here today.
And I want to thank the listeners for showing
up through apparently seven
drops of the feed. They stayed with
the show tonight. I know right.
We got to figure out what the hell's. And like
Alan's not here so there's no bandwidth
coming out of the office tonight. No I don't think it's us
because I'm not getting disconnected
from chat so.
Something's up. I'm not running anything either so.
But anyway thank you
guys again for your support and if you got to the
whole end of the show you're listening on the podcast
you know what thank you too for listening to all
three and a half hours of it. You guys rock.
Of course I could be really evil and vindictive and put
the pass phrase like right here at the very very end so
people have to like. Oh just kidding.
Boogers. No it's not. Don't listen. It's not it.
Alright. Anyhow
let's go around and get everybody's
final thought. DarkSakura what's your final thought
tonight? I just got wind a certain bit
of news that I
actually think is super cool.
Have you ever heard of the company
Bob's Red Mill?
It makes like grains and cereals
and gluten free stuff and.
No but okay. You can find it like in the health
section that type of thing. Well
the owner actually just handed over the company
to the employees to make it employee
stock owned. Oh.
Meaning that all of
the stock
increases go directly into their retirement
funds. Nice. As a trust they can
also borrow from which I wish more
companies would be like that you know to
work for the benefit of their employees.
So just saying not all rich
people are assholes I guess.
Saying. Loki your final thought
tonight. My car sucks.
Hopefully I get a new car though.
Because we're looking at new cars now. Or
new to me cars.
Not necessarily new cars.
Less old.
Not necessarily.
Less mileage hopefully.
I want to thank everybody for listening
to the show tonight and sticking with it
and remember if you like our show just
tell a friend or two about the show. Help spread
the word. That's all we ask. We don't charge
for it or anything like that. So
just help spread the word about the VoG network
and what we're doing here. And that's
all we want. Just help grow our community.
That and vote in the podcast awards
if you can. It would be nice. It would be nice too.
Vote every day and then
get another IP and vote there too.
Don't cheat. Don't cheat.
Don't cheat. Just vote enthusiastically.
Just support multiple personalities.
You'll never know that you voted twice.
Alright stop. Alright.
That does it. My final thought.
I'm gonna go with an old classic.
My final thought tonight.
Be good to yourself. And
each other.
Be excellent to each other.
Have a wonderful week everybody. We'll be back
to do it all again next time. Same bat
time. Same bat channel.
Good night everybody.
