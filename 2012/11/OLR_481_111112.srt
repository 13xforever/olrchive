00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Tonight, November 11th, 2012, Nintendo reveals some more details about the Wii U

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
THQ delays games as stocks fall, and could the Kinect soon police your content licenses?

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Orange Lounge Radio

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 481 for this November the 11th of 2012

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and all that good stuff

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
With my co-hosts, first off, the one, the only, DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hi

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
How are you, Jamie Summers?

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Um, I'm okay

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Your knitting rainbow things over here are crocheting

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm crocheting the gayest scarf ever, all it needs is KY jelly and it'll be gayer

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Are you planning in advance of Gay Pride Month? Are you planning to sell these?

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
No, this is actually, it's a scheme that I've had for a while and I thought was kind of a different bit of yarn

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But, um, I've been taking orders for scrap scarves

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Basically I'm working through all of my old cheap yarn

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And this was actually a fairly cheap scheme, I just didn't realize that it was going to crochet up so pretty

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So I'm actually going to go back and buy more of them to make people scarves and things for various pride events and whatnots

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Or like the holidays? Because, you know, everybody likes a homemade holiday gift, I do

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Well, that's actually why I texted you a while back and asked if you or Alan were allergic to wool

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yay! Awesome

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Because I'm broke

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Well, also say hello to somebody that I'm sure is making lots of homemade gifts for the holiday, Techmaster Loki

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Um, no, I'm not

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You're not going to bake cookies for everybody for the holidays?

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
No, I don't do much baking

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Well, how have you-

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Let's order some cookies from Colorado

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Right? How have you been doing, Loki?

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Oh, fantastic with my car not working and everything

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Oh, yeah, sorry to hear about that

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yeah, it was the Ford we expect

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Fix or repair daily, right?

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Well, it's not just the three of us on the show every week, it's you guys joining us live in our chat room

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
And again, our chat room live.vognetwork.com

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You know, there is another thing that Ford can stand for

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What?

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Found on Road Dead

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yeah, I've heard that one too

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
From a parking lot

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But it doesn't work

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yeah

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Alright, so we're going to get into some news and what we've been playing this week

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And some big interviews tonight that I will talk about in just a moment

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But I do want to start off the show first because we have some interviews tonight

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I know we might have a few new listeners because of that

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I want to say hello, welcome to the show

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Reintroduce ourselves a little bit

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
We try to do that once every few months or so for those folks that are new to Orange Lounge Radio

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But if you are new to Orange Lounge Radio, hello

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We're a show, we created this show, myself, Dark Soccer and Loki all created this show

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Ten years ago, over ten years ago

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We all met playing a little game you might have heard of in the arcades

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Stomping arrows called Dance Dance Revolution

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And we used to play that pretty aggressively here in the south

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I don't know what other words you used to describe it

63
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
We were angry DDR players

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Damn these arrows, damn them

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And birthday parties

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
At Roseville Golf Land where we sat on the floor in front of the fourth mix and ate cake

67
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That was my birthday

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I still remember one of the first dream games we ever had on Orange Lounge Radio

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Was inspired by Golf Land trips

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You called it birthday party sniper

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Something like that

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Yeah, Roseville Golf Land is an interesting place

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
It still is today, interesting is a good word to describe it

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Like people who pick their nose and eat it

75
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's interesting

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I went not too long ago and wore myself out by DDR

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I was like, I got old

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I know right

79
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But anyway, ten years ago we all met playing DDR

80
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And we were really into that scene

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It wasn't just DDR

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It was a lot of the imports coming from Japan

83
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
We used to have the Bamani parties here locally

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The sacramentals having the Bamani parties

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Where we'd bust out the Beatmania 5 key, the Beatmania 2DX

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Guitar freaks

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I remember I couldn't get that name because a Catholic organization took it

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Really?

89
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yeah

90
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I forgot about that

91
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Well anyway

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
So we decided to make this little show

93
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Because I have some prior radio experience dating back to college

94
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
And another show I was on many years ago called Undersedation Live

95
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
And myself, Dark Soccer, and Loki after a long day at the arcade

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
No matter what we were playing at the time

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Whether it be DDR, Initial D, or something like that

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
We used to go to a little restaurant that was in the parking lot

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
And we'd just kind of sit around, order things that were bad for us

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Like mozzarella sticks

101
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And just talk some shit about video games

102
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And what was going on

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And so that was really the type of thing we wanted to bring here to the internets

104
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Is this giant virtual table

105
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Where we're all sitting on one side of it here in the studio

106
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Talking our stuff

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And then you guys kind of make up the rest of that table

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Sitting here with us in the chat room

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And via the Skype line and so forth

110
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Just talking some good stuff about video games

111
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And just having fun with it

112
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Because that's what video games are all about

113
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Fun and

114
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Talking smack about stupid people

115
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
DDR and that whole thing and Beatmania

116
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Bimani in general

117
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Music games was really all about community

118
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
So segueing a little bit into

119
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
One of the interviews we're going to have tonight

120
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Is with our buddy Eddie

121
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He runs a website you might have heard of

122
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
If you've played music games before

123
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's called BimaniStyle.com

124
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And that site's been around a very long time

125
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
In fact I think it's older than us

126
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
By a few months

127
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So we're going to talk to Eddie tonight

128
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
About community

129
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Because he has

130
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Especially now that DDR Freak is sunsetted

131
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's no more

132
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
He probably has the largest music game community that's out there

133
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
So I want to talk to him just kind of about

134
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The past

135
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The future

136
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
And so forth

137
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
And have some fun commentary with him on that

138
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
So we'll be talking to him in about 15 minutes or so

139
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Also on tonight's show

140
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
We have another interview

141
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
A taped interview we're going to play tonight during our break

142
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Where the music usually is

143
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
This is something that DJ Rama S did for us

144
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And I'll talk more about this

145
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
This whole

146
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
That we have other people doing interviews

147
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'll talk more about that later

148
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But this is an exciting interview

149
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's Jen

150
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
From a website called Girl Gamer Vogue

151
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
GG Vogue.com

152
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
She's going to talk about

153
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Her girl gaming community

154
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
In the tri-state area back east

155
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And why she made it

156
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And what it's all about

157
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So we're going to have that a little later on in the show

158
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Probably closer to about 8 o'clock

159
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Before we get to the interviews and so forth

160
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We're going to get into our gaming weeks

161
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But I want to talk

162
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
A little bit here

163
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
At the top of the show about something personal

164
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Because we did talk about

165
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The shows are all about community

166
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
And over these 10 years that we've been doing this show

167
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
We have a lot of the same people that show up in our chat room week after week

168
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And they like to hear the little insights that are going on in our personal lives

169
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Both the good and the bad

170
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
And I have to share something with you guys tonight

171
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That kind of happened

172
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I just want to get off my chest

173
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Because the weird thing about this is

174
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And I'm going to apologize to Jamie in advance for this

175
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Because a lot of this is very deja vu

176
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
To a story that she told

177
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Not even three weeks ago

178
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Perfectly okay

179
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Just forgive me if I get sniffy

180
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
It's fine

181
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The whole thing's just weird

182
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
So you guys can probably guess where I'm going with this

183
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
If I'm referencing that

184
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
As many of you know

185
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I moved in with my boyfriend Allen

186
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
About, gosh it was probably about

187
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Almost two years ago now

188
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And we

189
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Actually more like a year and a half

190
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But anyway

191
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
He brought with him two cats that he's had for a long time

192
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Since 2000 I think

193
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I think he got them around October of 2000

194
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And they were about four or six months old at the time

195
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Probably fudging some of these details

196
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
But I wasn't around back then

197
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And their names are

198
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Maruko and Sanrio

199
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And Maruko was a male black cat

200
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
And Sanrio's a tan cat

201
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Female

202
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
And you know I've grown very close to these cats as well

203
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And you've probably heard them referenced on the show sometimes

204
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
In fact it was really weird

205
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Just the other day

206
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I was listening to a playback

207
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Yes I do listen to OLR once in a while

208
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's a really good way to kind of be a

209
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Critic of yourself

210
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I was listening to the show a couple weeks ago

211
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And I believe Maruko came out

212
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Because I heard Jamie like

213
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Oh hey Maruko like you were petting him

214
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
They were very unlike Shirmi

215
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Where they don't come out during the shows

216
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Because they're very shy

217
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And they don't like people

218
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
She was like already there you can't move her

219
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
This is my couch

220
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You don't like it get out

221
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Maruko always pranced around with his tail in the air

222
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
So I always called him Mr. Priss

223
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But he was also very vocal

224
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
And was a really fun cat

225
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And I really have grown to appreciate Maruko

226
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And he loves Sanrio's food

227
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
No doubt

228
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You can sadly guess where this is going

229
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
We got blindsided a little bit

230
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The past couple days

231
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Maruko started showing some really bad symptoms

232
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
On Thursday and Friday

233
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
He just wasn't himself

234
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I can't even describe it

235
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
His meows were different

236
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
He was always a very vocal cat

237
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The way he was breathing was very different as well

238
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
So I told Alan well of course let's go see the vet

239
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Right away

240
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
We got to the vet's office pretty much thinking

241
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Oh you know we just need to get some medication

242
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
He'll be alright whatever

243
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
But we get the x-rays back and the news is really bad

244
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
He had a lot of fluid in his body

245
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
In places it shouldn't be

246
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Basically so much around his lung

247
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
That it was basically pushing on his lung

248
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
And he was having a hard time breathing

249
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That was causing it

250
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Unfortunately

251
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
A tough decision had to be made

252
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And we put him down yesterday

253
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And it was

254
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What can I say?

255
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It was devastating

256
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Just the shock of it all

257
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Just the fact that this came out

258
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Of literally nowhere

259
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Even though this thing that he'd been developing

260
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Apparently was silently developing for years

261
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
But even if we had

262
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The thousands of dollars to pursue

263
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
A diagnosis and figure out

264
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What was causing it

265
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
The veterinarian made it pretty clear that

266
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It's probably heart failure

267
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's probably cancer

268
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I have another friend that just lost a cat to FIP

269
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Not that long ago

270
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So it's just like

271
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's tough

272
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
With Shermy she was wheezing

273
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
When we got back from Disneyland

274
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And then I wrapped her up in hot towels

275
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
For a few days

276
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And she perked right back up

277
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And then suddenly she just

278
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Keeled over

279
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
But the symptoms sound very serious

280
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And it's just like

281
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's just like

282
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
But the symptoms sound very serious

283
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
She was having respiratory issues

284
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Since some folks in the chat room

285
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Are asking at live.vognetwork.com

286
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The Maruko was 12 and a half

287
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So a little old

288
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
In kitty ears

289
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
For an indoor cat

290
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Maybe not super old

291
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
But definitely old enough

292
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
For complications to start coming in

293
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
So I don't know what else to say

294
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I just want to get that off my chest

295
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So that way if I'm gonna sniffle up

296
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And not while we're trying to interview somebody

297
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Hi Eddie how are you?

298
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
He was a very good kitty

299
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And he sat in my lap a couple times

300
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Well you used to cat sit

301
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So I know you were one of the first people I called in the parking lot

302
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And I was like

303
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm driving

304
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I was actually literally

305
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
This was at what Florin Mall used to be

306
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
If you want to know where I was

307
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And I was having the thing to pull out

308
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Into the street when you called

309
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And I was trying to be considerate

310
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And I was like okay fine

311
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
And then it went on to FaceTime

312
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I was like oh shit have I been on FaceTime this entire time

313
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
And turn around and pull in

314
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And I had my friend with me

315
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
And then I just did a circle in the parking lot

316
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Anyway I want to try and move on

317
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I don't want to dwell on this too much

318
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
But I do want to address

319
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Some of the comments that are in chatroom

320
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
At live.vognetwork.com

321
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Lots of condolences and thank you very much

322
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I will pass those along to Alan as well

323
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I was only fortunate enough to know Maruko for about 3 years

324
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
But he did live for 12 and a half

325
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Tigerclaw says my condolences

326
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Losing a pet is the hardest thing a person could ever go through

327
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It is definitely one of the worst

328
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Tigerclaw asks how about Sanrio

329
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
How is she health wise

330
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Obviously the plan is

331
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
When we have money

332
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Because yesterday set us back a little bit

333
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But when we have some money we do want to go in and get her checked

334
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And make sure she didn't contract the same virus

335
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
That's one of the first things we want to try and rule out

336
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
She's doing okay

337
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
She's hard to read right now

338
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I think she knows something's up

339
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
She's kind of looking around

340
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Acting a little differently

341
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I think she knows something's missing

342
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
But that's to be expected

343
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
But she still has some of her playfulness

344
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I took a really cute video earlier today

345
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Of her playing with a string

346
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
So you know

347
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
We'll see

348
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
We'll try to get her in as soon as we can

349
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
When we can financially

350
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Take care of it

351
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Going to some other comments in our chatroom

352
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I like this from Breakman it's very good

353
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Cats and dogs are such a great part of our life

354
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
But they are so fragile

355
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And their time with us is far too short

356
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Ain't that the truth

357
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Gamegrew says I'm sorry about your cat

358
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I've lost my last cat a few months ago

359
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's tough

360
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And especially

361
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The suddenness of it all

362
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Is tough

363
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I want to move on

364
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
How do we escape from reality

365
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
By playing video games

366
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Well not in my case I drank and cried

367
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
For a night

368
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
We haven't quite had that phase

369
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yet and I'm hoping we'll be alright

370
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
But if we have to have that we will

371
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Sometimes it doesn't hit you

372
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
For a little while

373
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Let's talk about video games and some of the other

374
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Distractions and things that are better

375
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And again if you do want to join us in our chatroom

376
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Live.vognetwork.com is the place

377
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
To be

378
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
DarkSagra why don't you start us off tonight

379
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I have a very happy announcement of something

380
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
That I've played

381
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Mass Effect 3

382
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
What a shock

383
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
The ghost patch

384
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Is what we're calling it

385
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Because I just decided on a whim

386
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
To check on it after a fresh boot

387
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And it patched something

388
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And I'm like really?

389
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
And so I loaded it and of course it rewrote

390
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
My hack file which is fine

391
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And I

392
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I loaded it up

393
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And lo and behold I had zero

394
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Problems none of the lag none of any of that

395
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So I was

396
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Quite happily surprised

397
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
And I

398
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Even checked it

399
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You know with other people

400
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I you know did a bunch of

401
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Other stuff to make sure it wasn't just a

402
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
A

403
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You know

404
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
What's the word I'm thinking of?

405
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Not a whim

406
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
But just a one off

407
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Thing and

408
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It kept working and so I was like

409
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Everyone get a multiplayer right now

410
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
So I played for a while with

411
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Shane and Tim

412
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
And then I played again

413
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
With Shane and

414
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Tim and Spike the other day

415
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
And with my friend George

416
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
And everything was fine I still kind of suck at it

417
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
But I'm getting better and

418
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Got a few levels in did the N7

419
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Challenge thing

420
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Fun so you got a banner

421
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And I wore my N7 shirt

422
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
That day and

423
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I also went in just to

424
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
See if it was like a completely new patch

425
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
So I tried to um to hack my game

426
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Again and well more like

427
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Hex edit it so that I could get the console to

428
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Unlock and the same it's at

429
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
The same sector it still works so

430
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
But everyone if you're trying to do

431
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
The hex edit based on what's on

432
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The mass effect wiki it's

433
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Not F4 for the last two

434
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Numbers it's F3 just letting

435
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You know I

436
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Did that on screw that up no I did it

437
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Because there's no F4 I did

438
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I did the F3 on a win because I found the

439
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Same sector and it worked so

440
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
They have it on there wrong

441
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
So um as

442
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I just said Tigerclaw um probably

443
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Didn't hear but I can play online again

444
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
And I went back in on my DLC

445
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Works and so that means I'm good

446
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
To go for Omega but we're calling

447
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It the ghost patch because

448
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
They didn't announce anything

449
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
They didn't even acknowledge that there

450
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Was a problem the only acknowledgement

451
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
That I got was from

452
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Some guy

453
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
In customer service

454
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Who actually worked with me for a long time

455
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
And he said yeah we're noticing that there's

456
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
A problem here we just can't say anything else about it

457
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Right now oh really

458
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I can't say

459
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
No comment I can't

460
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Say anything on that he was

461
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
He did more for me than the other people

462
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Did but

463
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
It did give me a nice little

464
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
30%

465
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Off code which I'm going to use for the Omega

466
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
DLC

467
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
So I'm very happy

468
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
And um I played

469
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Through Mass Effect 2 I actually did

470
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Touch WoW long enough to

471
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Log out while I was trying to make

472
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Plans with you to go see Silent Hill

473
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I completely forgot that I was logged in and

474
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Talking to you

475
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Did you guys go see Silent Hill? No we still haven't made it out

476
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
To see it

477
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You need to do that

478
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
BlackWolf has a smart ass comment

479
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
In our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

480
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
In response to your fact

481
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
That the information on the wiki is wrong

482
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
He says if only it was a wiki

483
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And everyone could edit it

484
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
That means I have to log in for an account on it and I don't

485
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Fucking feel like it

486
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
That means I have to do work

487
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Well the other thing

488
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
And I think I mentioned it last week is now that I have a job

489
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Like a real job

490
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
That's going to pay me some good money

491
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Hooray for money

492
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
That I kind of haven't had much

493
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Garris

494
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I haven't had a whole bunch of time

495
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
To really do much except

496
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
That the good thing about my job is that since I don't usually have to

497
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Be in until 9 in the morning

498
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I can stay up till midnight and sleep in

499
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
And so I can actually

500
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Because who really feels like

501
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Waking up early in the morning and gaming

502
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Before work? Seriously?

503
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Gaming is something you stay up all night

504
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
And do. You play games in the morning, Logie?

505
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I would if I didn't have to get

506
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
The baby up

507
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I like to stay up all night

508
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I don't have children, that's awesome

509
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I've stayed up all night and done that still

510
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
He's not really a baby anymore either

511
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
He's more of a toddler

512
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Just saying

513
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
At any rate

514
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
At any rate

515
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
My schedule has actually been pretty perfect

516
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
For gaming except that

517
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
My work environment is so fast paced

518
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
And I don't get paid days off which makes me a little sad

519
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
But it's all good

520
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
That's my work

521
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
It's in a small office in a house

522
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And I have so much freedom

523
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
For my scheduling and for things that need to happen

524
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And I can wear socks

525
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I ask permission to wear my fuzzy socks in the office

526
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
And I can do it

527
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's great. Anyways

528
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
My work allows me more game time

529
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
So I will be playing more stuff

530
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Awesome. Logie, how was your gaming week?

531
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I played Call of Duty Black Ops 2

532
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Yes, I know it's not out yet

533
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
How's that gonna stop me?

534
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
When you work in games distribution

535
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
You can sometimes

536
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
You know, do things early

537
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Anyways, so, got the play

538
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Obviously haven't been playing any multiplayer

539
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
On it, well, no

540
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Internet multiplayer because the servers aren't up

541
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And also you want to be careful

542
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Because everyone, after the whole Halo leaking out a month

543
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Early and stuff like that

544
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
So

545
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Been playing mainly the single player campaign

546
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And really that's kind of cool

547
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Because I haven't played a lot

548
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Of the single player campaigns

549
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I played a bit of Modern Warfare 3 single player campaign

550
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
And totally hated it

551
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Because they were

552
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Really penalizing you with shooting your teammates

553
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Not that I'm trying to shoot my teammates

554
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
But everyone kind of blends in

555
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
When it's so chaotic and stuff

556
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
And it seems like Black Ops 2 isn't so

557
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
At least

558
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I'm playing on a super easy difficulty too

559
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Because I just really care about the story

560
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I don't give a shit about the challenge

561
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
But

562
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You know, I haven't had that problem

563
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Where, oh, you accidentally killed a teammate

564
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Because, you know, he ran in front of you

565
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
When you're firing a missile or something like that

566
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
You know, so that's kind of cool

567
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
But the story is fucking awesome

568
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It's just like, it's really action packed

569
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
And just, I really enjoy it

570
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
And that's saying a lot

571
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Considering that a lot of times

572
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
People consider the, like, single player

573
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Campaign for these kind of games

574
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
To be kind of just a throw away

575
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It's just, oh, well they have it on there

576
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Actually, the single player is pretty awesome

577
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Like, and I actually want to check out

578
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
The first Black Ops game

579
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Because I never played it

580
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
But, you know, obviously carrying on with the characters

581
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
That they have from the first game

582
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
But it just, like, for example

583
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
There's one scene, it kind of flips back and forth

584
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Between the past and the future

585
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Warfare

586
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
So, the first kind of future warfare

587
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
One that you're in, you're kind of swinging along

588
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
This, it's like a mountainside

589
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Or something like that

590
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
And you're tethered to this other guy

591
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And you have these nanogloves that you can grip onto the rocks and stuff

592
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
And they're scouting out this

593
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
This base that's, you know, kind of in a temple

594
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Or something like that

595
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
And so, they put on their wingsuits

596
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And they fly down there

597
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
And just that sequence is so fucking awesome

598
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It's just, like, I saw them

599
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It's like, this is so awesome

600
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Does it have, like, 80's metal playing in the background?

601
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
No, there's no 80's metal playing

602
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
It's very, like, cinematic

603
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Because, uh, Knight, was it Trent Reznor

604
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Oh, that's right!

605
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's just really awesome

606
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Like, you're flying down there

607
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
And I know it's not really, like, a quick time thing and stuff

608
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I mean, there are some quick time stuff in there

609
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
But it wasn't that big a deal

610
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
But, um, it was just really cool

611
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
And then you get into this, like, secret thing under the base

612
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And it's like, oh, it's this, you know, nanobot factory thing

613
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
That's pretty awesome

614
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And then there's also the one that you've seen in the trailer

615
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Where you're riding on a horseback

616
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
And it's one of the flashback missions that you're on

617
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
But you're playing on a horseback

618
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Like, almost the whole mission

619
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
And it's awesome, because you're just

620
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Blowing up tanks with a rocket launcher on the back of a horse

621
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
And there's, like, helicopters flying over

622
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Wait, say that again?

623
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Blowing up tanks

624
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
You're blowing up tanks on the back of a horse

625
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
You're holding a rocket launcher and riding a horse

626
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I swear to God, that was a scene in Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter

627
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
That was sort of a scene in the commercial

628
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Except the girl had grenades

629
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
But it's just

630
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It's so, like, chaotic and awesome

631
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
It's a really

632
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I love it, I love the campaign

633
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And it really kind of makes me want to go back and try some of the other

634
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Single player campaigns of the different games

635
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
But just for some reason, this, like, kind of

636
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Near future combat stuff is just really

637
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Cool, like, the storyline's actually

638
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I think really well done

639
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
So, um, definitely worth checking out

640
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I mean, even if you're kind of thinking twice about

641
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Eh, it's just another Modern Warfare shooter game

642
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Check out the storyline

643
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
They actually did a pretty good job on it

644
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
So besides that, played a little bit more Minecraft

645
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Been just trying to get, you know, plugins and stuff

646
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
To work correctly with each other

647
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I'm working on finishing up the mob arena stuff

648
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
So I have this Magic Spells

649
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Um, plugin that I added in there

650
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
But I didn't realize it had a dependent

651
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Plugin with this vault thing that I had to install

652
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
In there, so I'm still trying to get that all worked out

653
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
And get the permissions set correctly

654
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Still kind of new to the whole bucket plugin stuff

655
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Um, and then I noticed that

656
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
One of our other users

657
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Hitstun had turned in the Mr. Freeze

658
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
And had frozen the jungles

659
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Everybody chill

660
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Seriously

661
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Wait a second, why can't I see off the roof of this

662
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Mob arena I created

663
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
What's going on here, is it just not drawing in

664
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I realize it's snow

665
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Leave it to Hitstun or somebody to bring

666
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
The League of Super-Villains into the

667
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
It was an accident

668
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
He was working with World Edit

669
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
It's always an accident

670
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
That's how villains get created

671
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Hey, it was easy to fix

672
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Joker fell into that vat

673
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
This is what happens when you play God

674
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
And it was fixed

675
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
He was making a snow globe

676
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
In the nether

677
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I don't know how that

678
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Got out onto everything else

679
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
But there's snow in a bunch of the

680
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Different chunks there

681
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
So I had to fix that

682
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I thought it was hilarious, there was snow in the jungle

683
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Yes, there was snow all over the jungle

684
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I was like, this is not right

685
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I had to find the corners and then

686
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Welcome to the jungle, we got lots of snow

687
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
So I fixed all that

688
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I tried playing a little bit of Curiosity

689
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
But it wasn't working

690
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
So that was that

691
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
And Call of Duty Black Ops

692
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Or not Black Ops, Modern Warfare 3

693
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
We've been playing multiplayer of that

694
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
And that's pretty fun

695
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I actually played a little bit of multiplayer in Black Ops 2 as well

696
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
The split screen stuff

697
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Actually the split screen stuff

698
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Because I was bored, I decided to take on

699
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Nine AI characters that were the

700
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Veteran difficulty, which is the hardest

701
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Because it's AI

702
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
And you figure out the weaknesses in their

703
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Pathfinding and away you go

704
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
So that was that

705
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I forgot one other game I played

706
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Very Solitaire

707
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
That's right because it was free, I played that too

708
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
It was actually fun

709
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
For a free game, better than Yaris

710
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
It was a good time killer

711
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I actually had fun with it because I like card games

712
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Yeah

713
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
It reminded me of Neopets

714
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I wouldn't have minded paying a little bit of money for it

715
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
But it was cute

716
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I used to play Pyramid Solitaire on Neopets all the time

717
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
That was a good tip Act F by the way last week

718
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Oh and the last thing, one of the things that they've been hyping up

719
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
About Black Ops 2 is these whole

720
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
This kind of like strike force missions

721
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
They fucking suck

722
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I hate the strike force missions

723
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
And the reason why is because they're on the multiplayer maps

724
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
It's basically kind of like this strategy thing

725
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Where you get a bunch of different troops and stuff

726
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And you can kind of, okay go here defend this

727
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Go here attack this

728
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
And you can jump into each of them

729
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
It's supposed to add this kind of strategy element to it

730
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
The problem is though

731
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Is the controlling of that stuff is really terrible

732
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
And so you're telling your troops to go here

733
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
And then you're trying to select one soldier

734
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
And it's selecting all of them

735
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
It's pain in the ass

736
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I found it more efficient for me to go into a soldier

737
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
And just do the mission myself

738
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
So that's kind of the only

739
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Poopoo thing about Black Ops 2 right now

740
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Halo Man in our chat room

741
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
At live.vognetwork.com says

742
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Today's headline, Loki loves a game

743
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
The Mayans have been proven to be right

744
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Dude I love games all the time

745
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Grand Theft Auto

746
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Hello

747
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
By the way Halo 4 made me nauseous

748
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
If you're done with your gaming week

749
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I want to quickly talk about mine

750
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I don't have a whole lot of time

751
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Because we're running a little late for Eddie's interview

752
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Because we got a late start tonight

753
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
But I want to quickly talk about

754
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
A couple games because I did play some new stuff this week

755
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
One of them is Halo 4

756
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Yes, me

757
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Halo, uh huh, I bought it

758
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Keep in mind

759
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I've been out of the Halo franchise for a little bit

760
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I didn't buy ODST, I didn't buy Anniversary

761
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I didn't buy Reach, the last Halo game I bought was Halo 3

762
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
And I didn't love Halo 3

763
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Because I didn't have a lot of friends

764
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
That were online playing the multiplayer

765
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
And for me that's kind of where it's at in Halo

766
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I don't get into the story mode too much

767
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
So Halo 4

768
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Is kind of a new boot to the series

769
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Because it's a new developer

770
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
It's 343 Industries

771
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I'm only through like the first two chapters

772
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
So I'm not going to try to speak with authority or anything

773
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
But I will say

774
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
It's interesting

775
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I feel a little lost

776
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Because I'm not as familiar with all the backstory

777
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
And so forth

778
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
But I can pick up enough of what's going on

779
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
That I'm not like hating it

780
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
And at the end of the day

781
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
The story is really about the relationship between

782
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Master Chief and Cortana

783
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Any review outlet that's talked about this game

784
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Is going to tell you that

785
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
There's too much more to really get into the series

786
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
But for me

787
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
It's always been multiplayer

788
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Is where it's at

789
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And I've been having fun

790
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
There's a group of about four of us that have been playing multiplayer online

791
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
And we've been trying out all the modes

792
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
You know, King of the Hill, Oddball

793
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
All the stuff you know from the old games

794
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Of course Slayer

795
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
But there's a couple fun new ones

796
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
And I gotta say

797
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I had a great time playing Flood

798
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Which is one of the new game modes

799
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Flood, some of you are the Spartans

800
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Like the normal guys

801
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
But some of you become the Flood

802
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
You become these like creatures that run really fast

803
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
And have swords

804
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
And basically it is a

805
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Kill the Spartans as fast as you can

806
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
And then once you kill a Spartan

807
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
They become a Flood

808
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
So it's kind of one of those like devour

809
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
You know everybody as fast as you can

810
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
And convert them and whoever can survive the longest

811
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Ultimately wins

812
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
But for some random ass reason

813
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
The creatures make horsey noises

814
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Like they go

815
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
They make these noises like horses

816
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
When they're dying and stuff

817
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
It's the creepiest thing in the world

818
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
And hilarious

819
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
So for a good time

820
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Just add Flood

821
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
And then there was this other mode we played

822
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I think it was like Griffonball or something like that

823
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Griffball

824
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
All the other ones have description

825
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
And for Griffball it said

826
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Just add awesome

827
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Something like that

828
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
So we go in this mode and all it is

829
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Is you have the gigantic gravity hammers

830
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
You can either have a hammer

831
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Or a sword

832
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
And it's just a game of

833
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Get the ball into the goal

834
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
But you have these giant hammers

835
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
That you're either knocking the ball around with

836
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Or the other players

837
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
And so that shit was really funny actually

838
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Even though we got beat bad

839
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Like it was Shane and I

840
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Versus Spike

841
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
And Tim

842
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
It was two on two

843
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
They wiped the floor with us

844
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Like five points to nothing

845
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
It was depressing

846
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
But yeah that was a good time

847
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I enjoyed myself

848
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
So if multiplayer is where Halo is at for you

849
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Then you're definitely going to enjoy

850
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Halo 4 I think

851
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
The graphics are a step up

852
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
It's just fun again

853
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
But keep in mind I've been away from Halo

854
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
For a good three years

855
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I'm sure the story mode is great too

856
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
You know

857
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Everybody says great things about it on the internet

858
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
But I'm not as into the lore and all that stuff

859
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
So I'm like okay yeah

860
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
The presentation is really good

861
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
There's a pretty cool scene in the beginning

862
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Where you're climbing up a wall and it's kind of neat

863
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
The other game I want to talk quickly about

864
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Little Big Planet Karting I picked up on the PlayStation 3

865
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I haven't played a lot of it

866
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Because I've been too busy with multiplayer on Halo 4

867
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
But I like it

868
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
It really does feel like a fusion

869
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Of ModNation Racers

870
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
And Little Big Planet

871
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Which is to obviously no one's surprise

872
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Because it's the same developers of ModNation Racers

873
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
With all the Little Big Planet stuff in it

874
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
It controls great

875
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
It's fun

876
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
I noticed there weren't a lot of people online to race against

877
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I'm not sure what's up with that

878
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Maybe because the game is so new and everybody is distracted with Halo 4

879
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I was just on at a weird time

880
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
But yeah

881
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
So far I'm liking Little Big Planet Karting

882
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
But I need more time with it

883
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
To give you my full opinions

884
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
The other games I'll talk about real quick

885
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Curiosity What's in the Cube

886
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I don't think that's really a game

887
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
We shouldn't call it a game

888
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
It's just a weird thing

889
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
They're having those server problems left and right

890
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Which is really unfortunate

891
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
But I like the zenness

892
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Of being able to just sit there and

893
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop

894
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
And kind of figure out the way to get

895
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Huge combos of coins and so forth

896
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
I was able to get enough coins

897
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
You can buy items that will let you break bricks faster

898
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
See that was a thing the shop wouldn't even open up for me

899
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Because it was so lagged out

900
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I got this pick

901
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
That let you do 3x3

902
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Bricks when you would tap

903
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
And you can rack up your combos so much faster

904
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
When you do that

905
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Doing the little random tappings are much more fruitful

906
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
When you do that so kind of neat

907
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
But anyway

908
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Curiosity not really a game

909
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
And they're having a lot of server problems

910
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
But it's free

911
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Bemani better than Yaris

912
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Little bit

913
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
The one other thing I want to talk about

914
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Since we are about to have a

915
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Bemani-centric interview here in a minute

916
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Reflectbeat is out on the

917
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
iOS systems now

918
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
And you can get that on iPad or iPhone

919
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
I've been playing a little bit of Reflectbeat on the iPad

920
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I did not know much about this game honestly

921
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I've been out of the loop of a lot of the Bemani stuff

922
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
So you know again

923
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
It's free you only get 3 songs

924
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Because they're trying to sell you the song packs

925
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
But it was different

926
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I want to try some like

927
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Versus and try to like play against somebody

928
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Because I think that would be where the game would

929
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Because there's more of a versus element to it

930
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Where if you hit certain notes

931
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
They'll actually bounce back to the other side

932
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
And the other player has to hit them so that's kind of neat

933
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
It was kind of fun

934
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
A little different

935
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Alright anyhow

936
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
We are going to, I'm running a little late here

937
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
So I want to get this in here

938
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
An interview

939
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
And I'm so happy to welcome to the show

940
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Eddie from BemaniStyle.com

941
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
A long running website about music gaming

942
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
And music game culture

943
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I want to bring him on the line and talk to him about

944
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
What's going on in the music game world

945
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Hey Eddie you there?

946
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
Yeah can you hear me?

947
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Yeah we can hear you just fine, how you doing Eddie?

948
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
I'm doing alright

949
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Thank you so much for coming on the show

950
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
It only took about 10 years right?

951
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Just about yeah

952
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
We got an E3 and so forth

953
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
But just never really thought to get you on the show

954
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Until now so welcome

955
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Thanks I appreciate it

956
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Alright well let's just

957
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Let's start with some questions

958
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
If you guys have questions for Eddie I know we probably have some of the

959
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
BemaniStyle community listening tonight

960
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
And I know we have some long time fans of music gaming

961
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Listening tonight

962
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
If you want to ask a question at live.bognetwork.com

963
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Just pop into the chat room and ask away

964
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
We'll read some of the questions here

965
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
A little later

966
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?

967
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
No no you have to ask him on topic

968
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Not a six hour show

969
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
So Eddie tell us

970
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
A little bit about your website

971
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Tell us about where BemaniStyle.com

972
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Came from, how did it start?

973
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Funny enough

974
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
It actually started

975
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Kind of as a result of

976
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
DDR spot, I don't know if you guys remember that

977
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Site or not but some of the old NorCal

978
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Players started that up years ago

979
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Kind of like a competitor to

980
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
DDRFreak and

981
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Mike No

982
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Was in Michigan for a tournament

983
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Way back in like 2001

984
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
And we ran into each other

985
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
And got to talking and at the time it was like

986
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Me, him

987
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
The owner of TeamGuilo.net

988
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Which was a Canadian site and

989
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
A friend of mine from the New England

990
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Area named Malcolm, we were all talking about making this

991
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Just gigantic site

992
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
To cover all music games

993
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Because as it had standed

994
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
DDR was being talked about

995
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Like everyone was kind of ignoring the other games

996
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
And that wasn't really what I was jiving with personally

997
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Because I liked the Five Key stuff a lot

998
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
And there was

999
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
A lot of ego that got in the way

1000
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
From the other two sites

1001
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
And nothing bad

1002
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
It wasn't like we were fighting or anything

1003
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
But there were a lot of arguments about the name and everything

1004
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
So Malcolm and I just kind of splintered off

1005
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And decided to start BemaniStyle

1006
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
You know, on our own

1007
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
And it was an early effort by

1008
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Me, him, some guys from the Midwest

1009
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
And a handful of people we knew in Japan

1010
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
To just get more

1011
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
You know, word out about the other series that people

1012
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Weren't playing at the time

1013
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
You've been very successful with BemaniStyle.com

1014
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Because it's really evolved into a place now where

1015
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I know for a while you were doing

1016
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
You were doing some type of record distribution

1017
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Or record stuff, right?

1018
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I'm still doing that actually

1019
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
It was kind of like a weird situation

1020
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I did

1021
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Slakes CD in the US

1022
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Back in like 2006

1023
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
And a year later we got in touch with

1024
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
DJ Chucky and the guys from Groovy

1025
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
About bringing them

1026
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Out to the US to play at Anime Central

1027
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
And that kind of spiraled

1028
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Into us distributing their albums

1029
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
In North America

1030
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
More Japanese hardcore stuff

1031
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Not Bemani-centric

1032
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
But ever since we did that we've had

1033
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
M Project

1034
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
DJ Chucky, No Chin, Groovy

1035
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Chorus K, Red Alice

1036
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Jackazid

1037
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Just a number of people have been featured in all these music games

1038
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Out to Chicago for the Anime Central

1039
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Show that we do every year

1040
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
So that's kind of like where that project is

1041
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
We're actually right now in the planning stages

1042
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
For our 2013 show

1043
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
So it's still going on

1044
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Awesome, so that's kind of the place to be as Anime Central

1045
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
If you want to see some of these artists that kind of

1046
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Started in music games I guess

1047
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Or I guess maybe known over here

1048
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
From that or whatever you want to say

1049
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Yeah, that's pretty much it

1050
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
What do you think has kept Bemani Style

1051
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I mean, you know, we just saw DDR Freak

1052
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
You know, you kind of mentioned that

1053
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Bemani Style kind of started as a

1054
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
It was meant to be somewhat like DDR Freak

1055
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
But more inclusive of the other music games

1056
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Well, obviously DDR Spot

1057
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
And before they shut down a long time ago

1058
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
DDR Freak just recently in the past year

1059
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Finally sunsetted and said

1060
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
You know, party's over

1061
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
How do you think Bemani Style

1062
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
What's kept Bemani Style

1063
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Above that and

1064
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
In light of these other sites sunsetting

1065
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Well, I mean, you know, one thing

1066
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
When it comes to running a website

1067
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Ultimately if it closes that's the decision of the person

1068
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Who owns the website and quite frankly

1069
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
You know, my feelings on it are

1070
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Even when I have my low points

1071
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Which, you know

1072
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Got us talking, what, a week ago

1073
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
A Facebook post that I made about how

1074
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
The community has been lately

1075
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Even when I've had my low points

1076
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
I just look at it as though I've been doing this site for 10 years

1077
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
How can you just walk away from something like that

1078
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Especially when people are still using it

1079
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
So I think it's just a

1080
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
There's a genuine interest from a lot of people

1081
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Who are really die hard fans for that

1082
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Information on, you know, the more

1083
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Global games, stuff that's not released over here

1084
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
And then at the same time there are people who are more

1085
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Casual that are into maybe

1086
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
Just the music and they like knowing when

1087
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
New songs are coming out, they don't play the

1088
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Games, they just want to know about the music

1089
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I think it's a variety of things, but the community's kind of stuck with us

1090
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
And I'm just really not

1091
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Ready to let it go, so

1092
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Just sticking with it as long as I can

1093
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Since you brought up Facebook

1094
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
And all that, where is

1095
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
The community at these days, you think

1096
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
What is the music game community

1097
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
It's split, it's kind of weird because

1098
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
You kind of have splinter groups now

1099
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
In regards to what games people are playing

1100
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
And what mentalities everybody has

1101
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Konami

1102
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Has not really been doing a lot to help

1103
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
The community over here in the US

1104
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
They never really have

1105
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
There have been attempts in the past

1106
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
With Beatmania

1107
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
And the home version DDR's that came out

1108
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Early on and DDR continuing on

1109
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
For years, but ultimately

1110
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
The hardcore fans

1111
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Kind of get the short

1112
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
End of the stick in the sense that

1113
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
They're very vocal about

1114
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
What they want from the games and Konami

1115
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Has to kind of

1116
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Appease both the mainstream

1117
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
And the hardcore fans

1118
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
And I think they lean a little bit too much towards

1119
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
The mainstream and not enough towards

1120
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
The hardcore fans

1121
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
So the hardcore fans have just kind of gotten

1122
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Sick of it, a lot of them

1123
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
It's just like any other internet community

1124
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
The more negative people

1125
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Tend to be the ones that stand out more

1126
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
In conversation, as opposed to the people who are

1127
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Praising the work of the people making the games

1128
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Or whatever the subject matter is

1129
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
So

1130
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
On the outside it looks

1131
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
As though the community has just

1132
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Degenerated to this massive

1133
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Negativity

1134
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
They're just tired of not getting

1135
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
Any of the games and being

1136
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Ignored and so on and so forth

1137
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
So you run into situations like what's

1138
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Happening right now with the DJ Max

1139
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Community, who for the most part

1140
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
Ever since Technica came out have just been

1141
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Growing at an exponential rate

1142
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
And a lot of them are really fantastic people

1143
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
But you'll see people that

1144
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Once anything goes wrong or something

1145
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Doesn't go their way

1146
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Everyone starts complaining

1147
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Or starts just outright

1148
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Talking shit about the company that makes the game

1149
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Not really looking at it from their perspective

1150
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
But saying like, hey, this is what I want

1151
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Why aren't you doing what I want you to do

1152
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
And so that tends to stand out over the people

1153
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Who are a little bit more

1154
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Positive and understanding about everything

1155
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
So from the outside looking in

1156
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I think the music game community kind of comes off

1157
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
As though it's not very

1158
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Welcoming as of late

1159
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
And I've had my criticisms over

1160
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Just the general

1161
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Attitudes of people for a long time

1162
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I think there's still just a ton of love

1163
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
For the games and the hardcore players

1164
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Are a little bit more vocal about

1165
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
What they expect than the people who play them

1166
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
A little bit more casually

1167
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Since you were talking about Konami

1168
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
And kind of like the difficult position

1169
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
They've been in for many years

1170
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Although I don't know, I kind of think that

1171
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
All the United States progress

1172
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
For DDR, anything they had going

1173
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
For it kind of went away when

1174
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Redmond and Hawaii both went away

1175
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
That was pretty much the end of that, right?

1176
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I wouldn't necessarily say that

1177
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I think that

1178
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
From a player expectation

1179
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
A lot of that went away because they lost that connection

1180
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I mean, when they were doing

1181
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
The games in Redmond especially

1182
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
The guys working on the games

1183
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Were fans of DDR

1184
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
A lot of them were really old school

1185
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
NorCal and SoCal players

1186
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
So that connection to the community

1187
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Definitely went away and I think that caused

1188
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
A lot of problems, but

1189
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
I don't think that the momentum

1190
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
Went away, so to speak

1191
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I think the momentum went away when

1192
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Konami wasn't really being as

1193
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Hands-on with certain projects

1194
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
As they used to be

1195
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
So you'd see things like the Wii games

1196
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Coming out, I think were a fantastic effort

1197
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I think they did a really good job with those

1198
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
The Xbox and the PS3 versions were kind of

1199
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Whatever, the song lists weren't fantastic

1200
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
But I mean, they were still very traditional

1201
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
DDR games, so then you look at the arcade side of things

1202
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
And

1203
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
After not ever

1204
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Making an attempt in North America with the

1205
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Arcade releases

1206
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Before Extreme, I mean, there was

1207
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
The original DDR 1.5 in the US

1208
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
And then there was DDR USA

1209
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
But honestly, neither of them were really

1210
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Valiant efforts on their behalf

1211
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
They kind of ignored everything for a long time

1212
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
And then the In the Groove thing happened

1213
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
And there was a lot of just

1214
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
I think a lot of people really resented

1215
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Them for that because they felt like

1216
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
If you're not going to do anything, why are you taking away

1217
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Our only outlet for these games?

1218
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
And then they did Supernova and Supernova 2

1219
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Which I personally think were great

1220
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,000
And those two

1221
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Like those two games in particular I think were a really good

1222
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Effort on their behalf, but then X and X2

1223
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Came out and it was just letting the wrong

1224
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
People handle the franchise

1225
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Handle the development of these cabinets

1226
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
And do the release and everything

1227
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
So we got kind of like a shoddy product

1228
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I mean, not even kind of a shoddy product

1229
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
It was really a shoddy product

1230
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
And a lot of people just

1231
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Kind of got fed up with it and walked away from it

1232
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
And I mean, I want to clear this up too

1233
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
In regards to the arcade stuff because I know a lot of people bring this up

1234
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
But DDRX2

1235
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Kind of had the same problems as DDRX1

1236
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Did where they were

1237
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Lowering the cost of production

1238
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
On the games and you could tell that

1239
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
You know, the quality went down a lot

1240
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Especially in the dance pads and they made

1241
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
A conscious effort to try

1242
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
To fix the problems from X

1243
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
To X2 because

1244
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Myself and some friends of mine were brought in

1245
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
To consult with them specifically on the

1246
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Arcade release to make sure certain things were up to snuff

1247
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
And when we had seen them

1248
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Everything was functioning

1249
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Perfectly fine and timing

1250
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Was fantastic and the games were actually really good quality

1251
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
And X2 as a mix is like one of my favorites

1252
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
In a long time and then

1253
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Somewhere between when we did our testing

1254
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Work with them and the actual release

1255
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Something changed and the

1256
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Final product that we got just ended up being this

1257
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Shoddy mess that, you know, constantly

1258
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Ends up in a state of disrepair and is almost

1259
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Unplayable

1260
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Let me go to the chat because there's quite a few comments

1261
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Going on in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

1262
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
First off, Shane Olinko

1263
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Is saying, we worked at Redwood City

1264
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Not Redmond, oops, my bad, sorry, I was thinking of the

1265
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Wrong video game company apparently, my bad, my bad

1266
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Mass effect on the brain?

1267
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Apparently, apparently

1268
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
YYR saying, I still

1269
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Believe that Supernova happened because

1270
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
In The Groove happened and a few folks agreeing

1271
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
With him, what do you think?

1272
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I don't think that that's the case

1273
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
At all actually, a lot of people

1274
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Look at that because of the timing

1275
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Of the whole thing, but

1276
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
A lot of people also don't remember

1277
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
What it was like when Extreme came out

1278
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
And when Extreme was in testing

1279
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
They had always been saying that

1280
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Extreme was kind of like a reboot for them

1281
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
The whole, we're starting all over and

1282
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
You know, kind of giving it a last hurrah

1283
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
On that hardware, but I think a lot of what

1284
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Caused them to take a break for so long was

1285
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Just the rampant bootlegging of that game

1286
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Just all over the world, they were losing

1287
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
So much money on it, so many potential sales

1288
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
And a lot of time

1289
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Went into developing a little bit

1290
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
More secure of a system

1291
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
And in between

1292
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
The period of time from Extreme to Supernova

1293
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
They had released Dancing Stage Fusion

1294
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
In the UK, which used kind of like the

1295
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Middleware hardware

1296
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
It was the same hardware that Pop and Music

1297
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Used, so it was a PS2 based hardware

1298
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
And it didn't use

1299
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Magic Gate Protection, but it was still pretty

1300
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Uncrackable, and finally

1301
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
They settled on the hardware that was used

1302
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Which was basically a PS2 in a box

1303
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
With an IO board that plugged into everything

1304
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
And, you know, had its issues with

1305
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Hard drives dying and all that other crap

1306
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
But I think a lot of the delay had more

1307
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
To do with them just trying to get a lockdown

1308
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
On the issues with all the bootlegging

1309
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Since we're talking about like

1310
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Reboots and all this stuff and where DDR

1311
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Is heading, you know, this news came up very

1312
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Recently, even after I asked you to come

1313
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
On the show originally, that is that

1314
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
There is this Dance Dance Revolution

1315
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Reboot that's location testing in Japan

1316
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Right now, what do you think about this?

1317
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Good idea for the series?

1318
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Bad idea? Not gonna go anywhere?

1319
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
What do you think? Well, I think too many people are

1320
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Looking at it the wrong way. I mean, just because

1321
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
They went back to naming it Dance Dance

1322
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Revolution doesn't necessarily mean it's a reboot

1323
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Um, you know

1324
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Pop and Music recently lost its

1325
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Numbering system. They dropped

1326
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
The newest version is

1327
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Technically the 21st version, but there's no

1328
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
21 anywhere on the banner

1329
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
And Guitar Freaks and

1330
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Drum Mania are getting reset as

1331
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
GITADORA, which is basically just like the

1332
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
XG games in a shiny white cabinet

1333
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
And no second player guitar on the Guitar Freaks

1334
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
version. Are you saying that everything's going the way

1335
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Of Apple, where now it's the new DDR?

1336
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Uh, well

1337
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
I think that's what people are gonna end up calling it

1338
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
DDR 2013, which is

1339
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
What people are calling it right now, but

1340
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I think that what they're doing is

1341
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
They're actually kind of going the rock band model

1342
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
With everything, and they're setting it up to be

1343
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
A platform as opposed to being

1344
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Something that you get yearly upgrades

1345
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
On. They have a new pricing

1346
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Model for the arcades in Japan that they just

1347
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Rolled out with the newest BeatMania, where

1348
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
The arcades pay a subsidized rate

1349
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
For the hardware and

1350
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
The game itself, and then Konami

1351
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
Kind of forces a profit share on the game

1352
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Through their Paselli and EMUsment networks

1353
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
So every month the arcades

1354
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Give up a certain amount of their profits, but they're

1355
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Paying so much less for the game as a whole

1356
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
And then throughout the course of the product's

1357
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Life, they'll upload a bunch of new

1358
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Songs and add some features

1359
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
To the online network, do more unlock games

1360
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Or whatever the case may be, and they've already

1361
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
Said that with the new DDR game, they've stated

1362
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
That every

1363
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Six months or so, they're gonna push out

1364
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Another 30 or 40 songs and a UI

1365
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Update and possibly new features

1366
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
And stuff, so I think that this is less

1367
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Of a reboot and more of a way to

1368
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Kind of

1369
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Restructure the way they do things

1370
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Based on how the arcade market

1371
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Has been declining everywhere

1372
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
In the world, like it's like a conscious

1373
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Effort to try to do something that

1374
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Arcade operators can work with but doesn't

1375
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Leave them in the hole at the end of the day

1376
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,000
So this is like

1377
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
The 11th doctor of DDR

1378
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Kinda, sorta

1379
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
It just sounds like they're forcing them basically to buy

1380
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
An upgrade each year because it's being subsidized

1381
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Throughout the entire year, and with

1382
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
The good faith that they're actually gonna put out

1383
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
30 to 40 songs or whatever for the

1384
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Next update, which, let's be honest

1385
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Compared to what I've seen with the home

1386
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Releases and what they support DLC wise

1387
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
That's

1388
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I'll be interested to see if they actually

1389
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Continue on with that after at least

1390
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
One update

1391
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Honestly though, I don't think that that's gonna be the case

1392
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
I don't think the CS games are at all

1393
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Indicative of what they're doing with the arcade stuff

1394
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Because they've been doing download content on the

1395
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Arcade games for a few versions now

1396
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
2DX18 had

1397
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Like an add-on patch really really

1398
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Really late into its life with a bunch of

1399
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Ubeat and Reflectbeat songs on it and then

1400
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Linkle came out and Linkle had like 2 or 3

1401
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Song updates, so I don't think

1402
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
That they're gonna give up on this

1403
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
And you've gotta look at it from the perspective of

1404
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
They're not really selling them upgrades anymore

1405
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
It's

1406
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Cutting the cost of production and it's also

1407
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Cutting the cost of development on these titles

1408
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
So there's no reason for them to not stick with it

1409
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Because it's constant profit

1410
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
If people are continuing to play the

1411
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Games, then the operators are gonna

1412
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Stick with the service and they're gonna stay

1413
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Subscribed to the amusement network and everything

1414
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
So it doesn't really benefit Konami at all

1415
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
To not stick with it and at the same time

1416
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
It costs them way less in development

1417
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
To do something like this than it would for them

1418
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
To crank out a new game every 8-12 months

1419
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Like they've done for the past 10 years

1420
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Of the series existence

1421
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
How does something like that work though

1422
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
For importers over in the US?

1423
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
It's kind of left to be

1424
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Unsaid right now, I mean they haven't

1425
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
They haven't been making any of the games really available

1426
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,000
For a while, DDR was available

1427
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
But it was available in such sketchy

1428
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Circumstances

1429
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
You had to buy, for X and X2

1430
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
You had to buy a new machine from Betzen

1431
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
And then there were these crap machines that would break down

1432
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,000
So you'd end up spending more money and repairing

1433
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,000
The game than you would make back

1434
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
And you would never pay off the machine

1435
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
That happened to a lot of arcades out here

1436
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
In regards to 2DX and Popin' Music

1437
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
And Guitar Fricks and Drummania

1438
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
UBeat and Reflectbeat don't even really exist

1439
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Over here outside of like

1440
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
3 locations

1441
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
One of them isn't even an arcade that have a UBeat machine

1442
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
They've never been available

1443
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Out here as upgrade kits

1444
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Because historically there just wasn't a lot of interest

1445
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
From the arcade operators

1446
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
For it, like even when they did the location tests

1447
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
For 2DX14

1448
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
And they did the UBeat location tests down here in Southern California

1449
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
So

1450
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
For importers, it really

1451
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
It's not

1452
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Changing the situation

1453
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
For them at all

1454
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Because it's not like people have been importing the games for years anyway

1455
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
I think the last one that was really readily imported

1456
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
As like a legit game

1457
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Was maybe 2DX Red

1458
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
And that was, I don't know, 2003, 2004

1459
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
So

1460
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I don't think it's really going to affect them at all

1461
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
At the same time though

1462
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
I really can't get too much into it

1463
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
But there is some stuff going on

1464
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,000
In regards to Konami's American

1465
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Arcade operations

1466
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
That I've, you know, become privy to

1467
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,000
And it's not really so much of a guarantee

1468
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
As much as it is

1469
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
They're showing genuine interest in getting the stuff out here

1470
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Because round one

1471
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Which had just opened up its second location here in Southern California

1472
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,000
The music games are actually

1473
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
Like hand over fist making more money

1474
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Than any other arcade games in the location

1475
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
This is including Redemption

1476
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
So they've pretty much put a mandate out

1477
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
That like all of their music games have to be up 100%

1478
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Of the time and if something goes down

1479
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
It needs to be fixed like immediately

1480
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Even if the parts need to be ordered from Japan

1481
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
And Konami's kind of latched on to this

1482
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
And they've been shopping

1483
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
They've been shopping the games around

1484
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
There are arcade distributors out here

1485
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Nothing's, you know, set in stone

1486
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Or anything like that

1487
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
But ever since they dropped the bets in as their lead distributor

1488
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
They have been making attempts to try to find someone else out here

1489
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,000
To handle the stuff

1490
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
So it's really just kind of hard to say where it's going to go

1491
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
At this point, you know

1492
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
It's the state of the arcade industry

1493
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
In North America

1494
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
That nobody wants to take risks on anything

1495
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
That's going to cost money

1496
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
And I think that might end up hurting it more

1497
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Than Konami's unwillingness to release anything

1498
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Am I to infer from this a little bit

1499
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
That maybe the, you know, we've talked about

1500
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Arcade, the arcade scene has been hurting

1501
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
For such a long time here in the states

1502
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
At least certainly the way we used to know it

1503
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Am I to infer from this that maybe music games

1504
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Are a way to get

1505
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Quote, quote, I'm using my quotey fingers

1506
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Real games back in the arcade

1507
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Well, you know, think back to 10 years ago

1508
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
When DDR first started getting popular in the US

1509
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Arcades had been dead since

1510
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
You know, Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter 2

1511
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
So it's

1512
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I see it as a cycle

1513
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
I see the whole arcade industry as a cycle

1514
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
And not to deviate too much from the conversation

1515
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
But, you know, the arcade industry

1516
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Just doesn't

1517
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
A lot of the operators are old

1518
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Older guys, there's a handful of younger guys

1519
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Who have been starting up their own places

1520
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
But a lot of arcade operators are older guys

1521
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
That just don't want to take risks on stuff anymore

1522
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
So redemption kind of rules

1523
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
That's the king of the arcade space right now

1524
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Because that's what's making money

1525
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
But there's a lot of laws that have been

1526
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Brought to light, not really

1527
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
They're not actually laws, but there's a lot of laws that are being

1528
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Proposed right now to kind of kill the

1529
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Redemption market because it's essentially

1530
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Gambling for children

1531
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:47,000
If something like that passes, it's going to

1532
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Cause a huge change in the arcade market

1533
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
But, you know, there are certain

1534
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Things like, I listened to the last few episodes

1535
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
And you guys are talking about Wreck-It Ralph

1536
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
And I think

1537
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
That the arcade industry as a whole

1538
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Missed its entire mark with that movie

1539
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
I think that that would have been

1540
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
A perfect chance for them to

1541
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Maybe appeal to Disney to do some more

1542
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Cross-promotion and get people out to their locations

1543
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
And bring some life back to the arcades again

1544
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
And nobody capitalized that at all

1545
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
There's always a DVD release

1546
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Yeah, but, you know, it's still going to be limited

1547
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
At that point, I think it's better to strike

1548
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
When the iron's hot, I went to a movie

1549
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Theater up here to see it, and they had

1550
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Like two arcade games in the entire place

1551
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
You'd think that a movie theater who's

1552
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Expected, and it's like the number one movie in America

1553
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Right now, like, wouldn't that get

1554
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
You to go to your route operators

1555
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:35,000
And be like, hey, get some more stuff in here right away

1556
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,000
We've got some extra space for you, bring in

1557
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Like a Pac-Man or bring in a racing game

1558
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Or something like that

1559
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Or one of those Wreck-It Ralph cabinets that they made

1560
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
You know, just for fun

1561
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
They're limited, though, I think they only put out like 30 of them

1562
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Well, why? Why not make more?

1563
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
It wouldn't be that expensive to set something up

1564
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
I mean, if you can run the game on an iPad, then

1565
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Yeah, you know, it's a promotional thing

1566
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
The game was free on iPad

1567
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I know you're big on Disney like all of us

1568
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
But the thing about Electronica was that little arcade they had there

1569
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
With all the perfect machines

1570
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Yeah, well

1571
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I still think Electronica kind of missed its point

1572
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
A little bit, too

1573
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
I mean, like, I'm really critical of the arcade industry

1574
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
So I'm not really the right guy to talk about something like that

1575
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
That's fine

1576
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
You know, they

1577
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
The thing with the Wreck-It Ralph machines is that

1578
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
They're converted Donkey Kong cabinets

1579
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
So it's not like there's like a

1580
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Pleather of those available for them to just

1581
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
You know, fix up and clean up

1582
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
And throw the game into

1583
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
I'm sure they worked within their means to get that released

1584
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
So, I mean, yeah, they could hobble

1585
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Something together and release it

1586
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
But, you know, where I think they really missed the mark

1587
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
And me and a friend of mine was talking about this at an arcade auction

1588
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Last week

1589
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Why didn't they make a game based on Sugar Rush?

1590
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
How hard would it be to

1591
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Throw a skin on a racing game

1592
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
And add in some of the features that were featured

1593
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
In the movie that were kind of talked about with that game

1594
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
And then push it out as an arcade game

1595
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Like, that's the missed

1596
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Cross-promotion opportunity of the year right there

1597
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
You know, you market that in Japan

1598
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
With AKB48 doing the soundtrack

1599
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
And you're set

1600
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Well, it'd be the new maximum tune

1601
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I swear, I was listening to the end credits

1602
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Going, is that AKB48?

1603
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
It is AKB48

1604
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Well, that was kind of big news in the J-pop community

1605
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Like, kind of how

1606
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Perfume being in Cars 2 was

1607
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
You know, they kind of got a lot of people talking

1608
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
I just think they're, I love the movie

1609
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
It was fantastic, but I think the whole industry

1610
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Kind of missed a lot of points

1611
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
All the cameos were fantastic

1612
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
But I think, you know, people didn't really handle

1613
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
The release of that movie properly

1614
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I don't think there was enough faith placed in it

1615
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I got just a couple more questions for you

1616
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
And then I want to go to the chat to see if they have anything

1617
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
I already see a few things popping up here

1618
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,000
But I've been dying to ask you this for years

1619
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,000
And this is a very controversial question

1620
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Within the community, but I have to know

1621
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
What you think about this one being

1622
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
You know, so vested in the community and so forth

1623
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,000
So, and it's about Guitar Hero

1624
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Because, you know, and I know this is like

1625
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Hello five years ago, but

1626
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
When this game took off, there was a lot of people

1627
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
In the community, they thought

1628
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
You know, Konami was robbed of Guitar Freaks

1629
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
And Guitar Hero has just come in

1630
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,000
And taken all the credit

1631
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,000
We all remember that review that X-Play did

1632
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,000
Of Beatmania that was ridiculous

1633
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Where they said it was ripping off Guitar Hero

1634
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
And all that, do you think Guitar Hero

1635
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
At the end of the day, was it a good thing?

1636
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
Or was it a bad thing?

1637
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
For American fans of Japanese music games?

1638
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
I think Guitar Hero

1639
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Before Red Octane was purchased

1640
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,000
By Activision was a fantastic thing

1641
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
For the music game community in the US

1642
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
When the game

1643
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Before the game was even announced

1644
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,000
To the public, I got a chance

1645
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,000
To see it

1646
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
I was hooked up with the guys at Red Octane

1647
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
They brought me in to see it like shortly after

1648
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
In the Groove PS2 launch party

1649
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,000
And I walked out of that

1650
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,000
That viewing just completely blown away by it

1651
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Because it was

1652
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,000
As far as a music game goes

1653
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,000
In North America, it was exactly what it needed to be

1654
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Because it's got enough

1655
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,000
There for both the hardcore player

1656
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Who wants to challenge

1657
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
But it's got the music that the mainstream player

1658
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Can kind of latch onto

1659
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
I still play rock band like crazy

1660
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,000
So I think that it was a great thing

1661
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,000
But I think once Activision took a hold of it

1662
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
And then started milking the franchise

1663
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
For everything it was worth

1664
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
The eventual downfall of the whole

1665
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Band based music game

1666
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Like all together

1667
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I think that that was really kind of where they missed

1668
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Their mark and handled it

1669
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,000
They didn't handle it right at all

1670
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
But I think initially it was a great idea

1671
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
And it's not really like Konami was robbed of it

1672
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
They knew the game was coming out

1673
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
And they made the conscious effort not to release it

1674
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
And a lot of people don't remember this either

1675
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
But back in 2000, Guitar Freaks was slated for release

1676
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,000
In the US, I still have a receipt

1677
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Some here in all my random music game

1678
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Collectibles for a pre-order that I placed at

1679
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
FYE in Cleveland, Ohio

1680
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Back in like, I want to say

1681
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
March of 2000 for that game

1682
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
And then it got cancelled like last minute

1683
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Well I remember playing the arcade version

1684
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
All the time, the US releases

1685
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,000
You know, and

1686
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,000
What was it that someone was telling me

1687
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
When I was still playing it

1688
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Oh yeah, I got my pre-order in

1689
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Basically what you were saying

1690
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
But I remember when we got contacted

1691
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,000
For them to do something for the local news

1692
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,000
For Guitar Hero

1693
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
At my house and they made me hide

1694
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
My Guitar Freaks stuff

1695
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
I think that's more of like a

1696
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Lawsuit issue than anything else

1697
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
You know, Activision did kind of go

1698
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Not Activision, but Red Octane went around that whole issue

1699
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
The right way

1700
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
They worked with Konami to get the licensing cleared

1701
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
For the release on that, unlike

1702
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Some previous music games have been done

1703
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
So that's kind of weird to hear

1704
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
Now I don't think Konami was really robbed of anything

1705
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I think that, you know, that was their fault

1706
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,000
For not releasing the game when they had the opportunity

1707
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
And really grabbing hold of that market early on

1708
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Absolutely

1709
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Especially if they were, if Red Octane was working with

1710
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Konami over the licensing then

1711
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
They saw, they had their eyes open the whole time

1712
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,000
Well yeah, and that's why Konami ended up

1713
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Producing the arcade cabinet

1714
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
Part of the licensing agreement

1715
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
That they had for that game

1716
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Was that Konami would take over the rights to produce

1717
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
And, you know, build the arcade cabinets

1718
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
For that title

1719
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Max Ninja in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com

1720
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Guitar Heroes 1, 2, and 3 are the best Guitar Hero games

1721
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
After that, it just sucked

1722
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
I wouldn't even really say

1723
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
Guitar Hero 3 was that great

1724
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
That was still never soft

1725
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,000
It was better than any of their other offerings

1726
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
But I still wouldn't say that it was like

1727
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
The top tier of the franchise

1728
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:26,000
It was definitely the cliff teetering game

1729
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Where it's like, oh, here we go, we're on our way down

1730
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Yeah, pretty much

1731
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
I was gonna say, I wonder what part of the agreement

1732
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Between Activision and Konami

1733
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
That they decided that they're gonna put out a really terrible

1734
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Music game called Rock Revolution

1735
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
And then help the sales of Guitar Heroes

1736
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
The stories I could tell you

1737
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
That I've heard about that one

1738
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Cause I know guys that worked on that on both sides

1739
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
In America and Japan

1740
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
And the guys in America were like

1741
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Gung-ho, they wanted to make this

1742
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
The best effort they ever possibly could have

1743
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
And I don't know if you guys

1744
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Ever played the drum portion of that game

1745
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,000
With the actual controller

1746
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
But the drum controller that they made for Rock Revolution

1747
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Is the best

1748
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Retail drum controller

1749
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
That comes packaged with one

1750
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Like it's better than the Guitar Hero

1751
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
Drum controller, it's better than the Rock Band

1752
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Drum controller, it was awesome

1753
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
But they produced so few of them

1754
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Like nobody really got a chance to get a hold of those

1755
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
But one of the stories that I had heard about that game

1756
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Was that the guy who started that whole project

1757
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
In Japan

1758
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Was actually doing it as like a quote unquote

1759
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Revenge project

1760
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Against the companies in America

1761
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
That had put out these rock games

1762
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
And I don't really know

1763
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
What his meaning of revenge was

1764
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Like was it to release a really bad game

1765
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
And punish the fans or was it like

1766
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
To try to put something out that would

1767
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Take all the sales

1768
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
That sounds like Wile E. Coyote kind of revenge

1769
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Where he builds the elaborate

1770
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Trap only to have a blow up in his face

1771
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Pretty much

1772
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
We obviously

1773
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Would not be able to get through an interview with you

1774
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Without talking at least a little bit about

1775
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
DJ Max

1776
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
I have loved music games

1777
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
For a very long time

1778
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
When OLR went through

1779
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
It's creative shift a few years ago

1780
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
We kind of opened ourselves up to the different types of games

1781
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
I have not been following the DJ Max

1782
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
News as rabidly as I was

1783
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
The earlier Konami series

1784
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Although when I saw

1785
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
The Technica machine in the arcade

1786
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
I thought it was a good time

1787
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
And I know there's a lot of stuff that they've been trying to do

1788
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
With the Vita and so forth

1789
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
What do you think maybe an old school music game fan

1790
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Like me who's kind of turned away

1791
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
From that scene a little bit

1792
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,000
What do you think

1793
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Maybe I should be looking at in

1794
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
DJ Max? Why should I maybe come back and

1795
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Give DJ Max a look?

1796
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Well it depends on which one you're going to play

1797
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
If you're going to play Technica

1798
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Then that's kind of like a whole different can of worms

1799
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Than if you're going to play the portable games

1800
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Which obviously would take a little bit of

1801
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Importing and dusting off your PSP

1802
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
I think with DJ Max

1803
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
As a franchise

1804
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
There's a lot of people out there that know that I work for Pentavision

1805
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
So I don't want anyone to think that this is like a

1806
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Company shill kind of thing here

1807
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
My attraction to the DJ Max franchise

1808
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Is kind of the same attraction that I have

1809
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
To Konami's Bimani games

1810
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
And that's the music that they use

1811
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
In the game

1812
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
It's a lot of original producers

1813
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Producing stuff under different genres

1814
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
And there's a lot of variety to the music

1815
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
In and of itself

1816
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
My attraction to music games personally

1817
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Has a lot less to do with the gameplay

1818
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,000
And a lot less to do with the music that they use

1819
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
So that's kind of where I think the strong point of the DJ Max franchise

1820
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Is that they really have like a

1821
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Very very diverse

1822
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Song list across all of the games

1823
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Whereas a lot of the Konami games

1824
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Shy of pop and music stick with the genre

1825
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
That is kind of reflective of the gameplay

1826
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Itself, so 2DX is a lot of

1827
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
Electronic music, Guitar Freak Syndrome

1828
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
And he has a lot of rock, so on and so forth

1829
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Now DJ Max has got everything from

1830
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Like hip-hop to R&B to like

1831
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
A plethora

1832
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Of electronic genres

1833
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
And you know

1834
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Hard rock music, punk rock music

1835
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Hardcore

1836
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Classic, I mean like it's

1837
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
That's really where it shines for me

1838
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000
The gameplay in Technica

1839
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
If you're speaking of that specifically

1840
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
It's different

1841
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,000
You know there's a lot to it that's similar to the other games

1842
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
But the whole touchscreen interface

1843
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
And the way that the interface of the game itself

1844
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
Functions is different

1845
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
And it was kind of fresh at the time that it came out

1846
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Obviously it's been you know 4 years since then

1847
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
But it's very fresh

1848
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Compared to a lot of other music game interfaces

1849
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Out there and it's not too hard to

1850
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Pick up and just the way

1851
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
That you interact with the game is very fun

1852
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
So I would say you know if you're a fan

1853
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Of the music that's what you should be looking forward to

1854
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,000
The most because there's just a ton of

1855
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,000
Really fantastic music in those games

1856
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Alright well we've had Eddie on like way longer

1857
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
Than we said we were going to have him on

1858
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
But if he's down with it I want to get

1859
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
A few questions from the chat room out

1860
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
So live.vognetwork.com is the place to ask your questions

1861
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Let me ask this one

1862
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
That was asked earlier from DasBacon

1863
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Who asked

1864
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
You got a left check

1865
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,000
I'm going to say beforehand by the way

1866
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,000
He's my roommate and he works on the website

1867
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
So his question is kind of like a midpoint

1868
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Loaded question alright

1869
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
I'll ask it anyway since I didn't know that

1870
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
And I thought it was a good question

1871
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
What is the future of Bomani Style?

1872
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Well we're just

1873
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
Kind of keep pushing forward really

1874
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
We had a huge server outage earlier

1875
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
In the year and

1876
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
It caused us to lose all the

1877
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Original data

1878
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
It's still out there it's not like the

1879
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Original hard drives died or anything like that

1880
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
But we don't have access to the server that the site used to be

1881
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Hosted on due to a complication with our old host

1882
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
So

1883
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
You know there was like a good

1884
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Six months or so where I

1885
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Just kind of gave up on everything

1886
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
And nothing was getting done

1887
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
But just recently you know I've got

1888
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
That bug again and I've got a few people helping us out

1889
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:48,000
And we're going to just kind of push

1890
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Forward in getting the most

1891
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Recent version that we had been developing

1892
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
For like the past two years finished and online

1893
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
With the resources that we have available

1894
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,000
And people will start seeing that soon

1895
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
With the headline section rolling out

1896
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
We've got a new machine location database

1897
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
On deck

1898
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Score trackers

1899
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
For just about every single game out there

1900
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I mean even ridiculous stuff

1901
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Like pop and stage will have a score tracker on the website

1902
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
We're going to do

1903
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Like a greatly expanded

1904
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Sim file database because that was like one of the most

1905
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Popular things we had on the site with

1906
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
New sorting options and just like

1907
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
A lot better ways to promote

1908
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Your files than what we had

1909
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Before because there was a lot of really

1910
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Good stuff that would just get hidden amongst like

1911
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
A sea of crap and

1912
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
That's one of the things we definitely want to change

1913
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
This time around once we get that going

1914
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Legend of Zaku wants to know is the

1915
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Bimani Land Ranch still open?

1916
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,000
We moved

1917
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,000
From the Bimani Land Ranch

1918
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Now we live in what we call the Bimani Land Resort

1919
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Second style

1920
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:50,000
It's a

1921
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
The old house was a ranch house in Anaheim

1922
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
California and it was just a really big place

1923
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
And we had like 30 arcade cabinets there

1924
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
And the new house

1925
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
It's not as open to the public as it used to be

1926
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Just because of space and we sold off some of the machines

1927
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
But we still have all of the key machines

1928
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
You know we keep them updated

1929
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
And now we have a pool

1930
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,000
A hot tub and a koi pond

1931
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
And a nice atrium so it's like a

1932
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Really kind of a relaxed place to hang out

1933
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
It's still open

1934
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,000
If you contact me via email or Facebook

1935
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Or whatever if you're going to be in town

1936
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
We can arrange to have you come over and hang out

1937
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Heck yeah we come to Disneyland down there all the time

1938
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
We're going to come storm the place

1939
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
If you guys come down here

1940
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
And not hang out at my house

1941
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
Let's see

1942
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Shane Olinko

1943
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Is asking a question

1944
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
I'm young and cheek but I'll ask it anyway

1945
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,000
Because a lot of people always kind of want to know

1946
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:42,000
How do I break into the industry

1947
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
How can I get hired at Pentavision

1948
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I don't even know if this is the one you can answer

1949
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I honestly don't even know man

1950
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,000
I got hired on accident

1951
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Like honestly speaking I got brought in

1952
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
With a bunch of friends of mine

1953
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
To consult for Technica 2

1954
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,000
When it first came out and we were helping them

1955
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:00,000
With the Technica 2.5

1956
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Project that never actually ended up happening

1957
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
And in one of the meetings

1958
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
They were basically staying

1959
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
They really liked

1960
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Or they appreciated all the help that we were giving them

1961
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
And were like well we wish we could compensate you some way

1962
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
And I was working for this just

1963
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Awful bankruptcy law firm

1964
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,000
Doing all their online marketing and I was just like

1965
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Give me a job, get me out of my job

1966
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
And it's cool, I'll do all this stuff for free

1967
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
And they brought me on

1968
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Nice

1969
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,000
So you just got to beg and ask a lot

1970
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Well it wasn't really

1971
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Like a begging kind of situation

1972
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
They put it on the table first

1973
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
I just said hey hire me

1974
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,000
And it just ended up working out that way

1975
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,000
You know Pentavision is a company

1976
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Here in the US specifically

1977
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
They're really in tune

1978
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
With the fans, they like listening to input

1979
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,000
A lot and they really feel bad

1980
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
When they do something that ends up disappointing

1981
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,000
People

1982
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
So really it's just a matter of like I'm sure

1983
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
Whenever we end up hiring

1984
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Which isn't really something we have on deck right now

1985
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,000
But whenever we end up hiring I'm sure

1986
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,000
The doors will be open to members of the community

1987
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Who are passionate enough that have the skills

1988
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
To want to work with us

1989
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
So I guess just keep an eye out on the Pentavision

1990
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:10,000
Global website

1991
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
If we ever throw up any job postings

1992
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Give us a contact

1993
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Let me ask this question from somebody

1994
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
They didn't change their nickname so I'll just call them 693

1995
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,000
Because that's the number they got

1996
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
What do you think is the future

1997
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
What do you think is the future of console

1998
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Rhythm music games

1999
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
And he follows up and says specifically

2000
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Ronnie CS games but I'm kind of interested

2001
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
In the general sense

2002
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
What do you think is the future of console music games

2003
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
In North America

2004
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
I really couldn't even give you

2005
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
An honest answer

2006
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
The market in the US has

2007
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Just proven itself to not be there

2008
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Especially as of late

2009
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Harmonix has a good thing going with

2010
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,000
The Rock Band 3 setup

2011
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
The game doesn't need anything else added to it

2012
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
So just cranking out new songs is perfect

2013
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
For their existing user base

2014
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
And Dance Central

2015
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Dance Central and Just Dance

2016
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Those will probably continue to be

2017
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Yearly games just because of the necessity

2018
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Of releasing them on a disc

2019
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
There's a lot of data that goes into

2020
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
The moves and choreographing

2021
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,000
The characters and stuff

2022
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
So I'm sure those will continue to be on disc

2023
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:18,000
But as far as hardcore music games

2024
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I can't be 100% certain

2025
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
Of this and I know I'm gonna

2026
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,000
Break wide open

2027
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Some news here but

2028
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Konami didn't show DDR at E3

2029
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
This year and when I

2030
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,000
Had asked them about it they had stated

2031
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
That it was because they wanted to take the franchise

2032
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Back to the drawing board and figure out

2033
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
A new way to do it that could

2034
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Cross both types of rhythm

2035
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Gamers

2036
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
I've wanted to pitch that

2037
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
I've been talking about that for a long time

2038
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Well they clearly stole it from you

2039
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Damn it I wanted to pitch something that was a cross

2040
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Between Dance Dance Revolution and Dance Masters

2041
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Basically kind of like what Dance Central is

2042
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
So you've got some of the appeals to arcade fans

2043
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
Some of the appeals to like

2044
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Just Dance stuff and then also on top of that

2045
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Have some sort of

2046
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
I had envisioned

2047
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
This kind of revolution adventure

2048
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Kind of taking their adventure mode

2049
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:10,000
But way beyond where they had it

2050
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Alright let the man finish I want to hear E3 gossip

2051
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,000
So anyway

2052
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
They had told me that they wanted to take it back to the drawing board

2053
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
I don't really know what that meant

2054
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
And this wasn't really a confirmation from them

2055
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
But through a mutual friend of mine

2056
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Or ours I should say

2057
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
I found out

2058
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Maybe

2059
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Three or four weeks ago

2060
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
That right around E3

2061
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
I think maybe two weeks beforehand

2062
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,000
That Naoki had quit Konami

2063
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
And it's speculative on my behalf

2064
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
But I would not be surprised

2065
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
If that had something to do with the delay

2066
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
In the game this year because he was the one

2067
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
That was heading up that entire project

2068
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:48,000
So I know since then

2069
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Things have been handed off to U1

2070
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Who's heading up DDR 2013

2071
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
In the arcades

2072
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
But yeah

2073
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
As far as the US goes I really couldn't say

2074
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
It's too hard to tell

2075
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
I mean Pentavision we're releasing

2076
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
DJ Max Technica Tune soon

2077
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,000
But realistically

2078
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,000
We're just not sure

2079
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
How it's going to sell because the Vita

2080
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
Is not a very widely performing

2081
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Platform right now

2082
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
And it's been really hard

2083
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:18,000
To market that game as a result of some of the

2084
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Contracts we have in place with our worldwide

2085
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Partners so the word hasn't gotten

2086
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Out about that title enough

2087
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
In terms of Japanese music games

2088
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
I don't

2089
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
My honest opinion is I don't think they really

2090
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Need to do console versions for them

2091
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Anymore because they have the arcades

2092
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
And I think that when you do

2093
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,000
A console version of a game that is primarily

2094
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
An arcade game like it is over there

2095
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:42,000
You're just taking

2096
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Activity away from the arcades at that point

2097
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
And so it's not to say

2098
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
That I don't think Konami will ever do another

2099
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Console music game because obviously they're doing

2100
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:52,000
You know Ubeat and Reflectbeat on the iPad

2101
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:54,000
But I don't think that they really need to do

2102
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
The console games I know that a lot of North

2103
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
American fans hate me for saying that

2104
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
And it definitely feel like they're owed

2105
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
Those console games but that's not the way

2106
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
The market works in Japan and since the games

2107
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,000
Are primarily Japanese I think that

2108
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
You know that's just kind of the state of

2109
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
Where they're at

2110
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,000
But without the console version of DDR how will I make my

2111
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Data

2112
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
See they made that really

2113
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Crappy flash utility

2114
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,000
For DDRX in the US

2115
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
And a whole five people used it

2116
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
So I'm sure there's

2117
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Ways around it it's not like people aren't clever

2118
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
There's a guy out there that wrote a utility

2119
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
That lets you create edits in StepMania

2120
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
And then export them as data that you could use in the

2121
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Arcade cabinets so

2122
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
People in the Bimani community are way too

2123
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Clever for their own good sometimes

2124
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
See I know what the solution to everything is

2125
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
To Para Para

2126
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Dance Masters is though

2127
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,000
I actually like Dance Masters

2128
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Because of the Para Para

2129
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Well Dance Evolution came out as an arcade cabinet in Japan

2130
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
And apparently it's one of those

2131
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Games that's not talked about widely but they get regular

2132
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Updates with new songs

2133
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
So it's still kind of doing

2134
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Well I guess and it you know that was one of the

2135
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Questions that I asked Naoki when we talked at

2136
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
E3 a few years ago when Dance Masters

2137
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Had been first released I said you know

2138
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:08,000
I noticed that Night of Fire is in this game

2139
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
And just you use the original

2140
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Routine for it

2141
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Is this influenced by Para Para

2142
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
At all? And he was like no

2143
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
No I worked on Para Para but it's not the same game

2144
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
But it's Para Para it's essentially like the

2145
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
Connect version of Para

2146
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Especially since they opened the old location of

2147
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Valfar up as Nikufar

2148
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
You know the Para Para scene is coming back so

2149
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Yeah well they never really died

2150
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
It just kind of like shrunk and now it's

2151
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:34,000
Expanding again so

2152
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,000
You know it's just one of those things I guess

2153
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Maybe when it gets big enough

2154
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
To make them make notice again

2155
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
And it's got like a type of music that it

2156
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Latches onto once again because I think

2157
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
I don't know if like the Hyper

2158
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Or was it Hyper Techno stuff I don't know if that's

2159
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Still really as relevant as it was a few years ago

2160
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
But I think if they latch onto

2161
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,000
A new style of music and it becomes popular

2162
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,000
In the mainstream of Japan again you could possibly

2163
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
See another Para Para game get released

2164
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Well Eddie you've been a really good sport

2165
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
On the show tonight I know we

2166
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
Said we'd have you on for about 20 minutes

2167
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
We're closer to 40 almost 45 now

2168
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
So I want to thank you for taking the extra time

2169
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,000
On the show tonight before we wrap up there is

2170
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
A question I always ask all the guests that come on

2171
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
The show what are

2172
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
You playing these days and it doesn't even have to

2173
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Be music games unless it happens to be music games

2174
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
What video games are you into right now?

2175
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
I've been playing

2176
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,000
A little bit of

2177
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
New Super Mario Brothers 2

2178
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Although I haven't been able to get into it as much as

2179
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,000
The original one for the DS

2180
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Actually

2181
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
I feel kind of weird saying it

2182
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
But I've been really addicted

2183
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,000
To the Adventure Time turbo jumping

2184
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:40,000
Fin game on iOS lately

2185
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
It's such like a

2186
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,000
It's an easy pick up and play like I could play it

2187
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,000
For two minutes anywhere and then like I'm all

2188
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Over that and I love Adventure Time

2189
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
I'm obsessed with it and I can't wait for the game coming out

2190
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
Later this month but

2191
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Other than that

2192
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,000
I'm going to start playing

2193
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Halo 4 soon and

2194
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
I'm planning to pick up Super Paper Mario Sticker Star

2195
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Later on this week

2196
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Nice, well Eddie before we let you go

2197
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
I want to get the plugs out there for your stuff

2198
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
If you don't already know about this website

2199
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
And you're into music game fans

2200
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Or if you're into music games I'm not sure how that's possible

2201
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
But bimanistyle.com

2202
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Is the place to get all the latest and greatest

2203
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
And what's going on in the music game scene especially

2204
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Overseas and so forth right?

2205
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
Oh yeah I mean well

2206
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
I don't want to be

2207
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Egotistical about it there are other

2208
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Resources out there that have been doing a better job

2209
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Than us lately but we try our best

2210
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
And we have a lot of

2211
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Friends in the industry so we come up with some

2212
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Pretty interesting stuff from time to time

2213
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
So I'd say we're worth checking out

2214
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Anything else you want to plug while you're here on the show tonight?

2215
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
If you guys are in the Chicago

2216
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Land area this upcoming May

2217
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
I'm not really too sure of the dates I'd go check it out on

2218
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Asen.org but we are doing

2219
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,000
Another show at Anime Central this upcoming year

2220
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
With the Japanese guys

2221
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
We haven't announced the roster

2222
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Yet but the guys we have on deck a lot of them

2223
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Have had music in the most recent Konami

2224
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
Music games and the parties we do are

2225
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,000
A really good time you can ask anybody who's been there

2226
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,000
So check out

2227
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Anime Central next year in Chicago

2228
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
And come party it up with us

2229
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Alright I'm going to close tonight with a question

2230
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
From Miko in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com

2231
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Eddie

2232
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Does solo suck anyway?

2233
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Dude

2234
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
You don't even need to ask me the question

2235
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Or the answer to that question everybody knows

2236
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
That solo does suck anyway

2237
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
And before I leave I do want to say this too

2238
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Apparently DJ Hung

2239
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Has been found working the shoe

2240
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Department of Nordstrom's in

2241
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Northern California recently

2242
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
He was spotted not too long ago

2243
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
And I really wanted to run into the

2244
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Department store and ask him that question

2245
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
But he wasn't working the day that I was in town

2246
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
I have memories

2247
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Good times. Eddie from

2248
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,000

We started all about

2251
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,000
And one of our original loves the music game scene

2252
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,000
And good luck with everything over at Pentavision

2253
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,000
And with the website and so forth alright?

2254
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000

2260
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,000
Thanks to Eddie from BimaniStyle.com

2261
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
For coming on the show appreciate that

2262
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
He works at the shoe department

2263
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
At Nordstrom's that guy

2264
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Hey you know what

2265
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
A couple of the

2266
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
People that you know

2267
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
The step squad ladies are now moms

2268
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
You know

2269
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
A few people have

2270
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Shed whole people

2271
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
It's really amazing to look

2272
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
At like some of those people that we knew

2273
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Ten years ago and would see at the DER tournaments

2274
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,000
And so forth and like what they're all doing now

2275
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
And it's funny like some of them went to go work in the industry

2276
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Like you know Mel B and Shane and some of those people

2277
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:46,000
And some of them I look at and they're like

2278
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Getting married and stuff and I'm like I knew you

2279
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
When you were 13

2280
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Yikes

2281
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Alright anyhow that was a very long interview

2282
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
But it was great worth every minute

2283
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
But we do want to keep moving on with the show

2284
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
We have some news to get into

2285
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Let me just get the housekeeping out of the way because I plug this every week

2286
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Twitter twitter.com slash olr

2287
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
And our Facebook facebook.com slash orange lounge radio

2288
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
And of course we are nominated

2289
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
In the podcast awards

2290
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Awards at podcastawards.com

2291
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
There's only about I think 4 days left

2292
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
To vote through the 15th

2293
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
You can vote every day we are nominated as best

2294
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Gaming and we would really

2295
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Appreciate your support obviously

2296
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
We don't have the financial backing of

2297
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
A large commercially funded website

2298
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
So word of mouth is all we got

2299
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
So we really do appreciate every vote

2300
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Please even if you're not going to vote for us

2301
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Keep it indie that's all we ask

2302
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
To register participation

2303
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
For this week's episode of orange lounge radio

2304
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
At vog network dot com

2305
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Use the pass phrase detail

2306
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Let's move on with some news

2307
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Finally Loki

2308
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Hey that's alright it was a great great show

2309
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,000
So far tonight absolutely fantastic

2310
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:52,000
So let's talk a little bit about the Wii U because

2311
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
We're right we're very close

2312
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,000
To the Wii U launch one week from today

2313
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
And of course there's still

2314
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,000
Some of that stuff

2315
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Out there that we don't yet know

2316
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,000
But mainly kind of tied with the whole network stuff

2317
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
So first off what is

2318
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Nintendo network ID

2319
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
And they actually have this whole kind of

2320
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Either Nintendo

2321
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Direct press conference

2322
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
Or not even press conference like

2323
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Consumer conferencing

2324
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Stream web video whatever you want to call it

2325
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,000
Anyways so they talked a little bit about it

2326
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,000
Basically what it is is that the friend code

2327
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
System has kind of been

2328
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,000
It's gone away and now it's being replaced by this

2329
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
Nintendo network ID

2330
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
And what the ID is going to be used for is

2331
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Basically like the 3DS

2332
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
They say smartphones

2333
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,000
And PCs

2334
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,000
Also of course

2335
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,000
The Wii U

2336
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,000
And it's going to be basically tied so that

2337
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
You know you have all your software

2338
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:48,000
You know logged into one thing

2339
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
In layman's terms

2340
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
It's basically going to be an account name

2341
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
So like you know you have an Xbox Live

2342
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
Or Playstation Network you have an account

2343
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
All that stuff is tied to you're going to have an account

2344
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
That's going to be a name and tie it to that

2345
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
And you can make

2346
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Your friends and do all that stuff

2347
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
So fantastic

2348
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Getting with the 21st century

2349
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
And getting rid of stupid friend codes

2350
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Welcome to the big kids table

2351
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Nintendo yay

2352
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Mommy wow

2353
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,000
Yes so it says basically

2354
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Users can exchange

2355
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,000
You know the

2356
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Number of whatever this number is

2357
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,000
Or

2358
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:28,000
I guess just like a friends code

2359
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
But then also they'll also be able to

2360
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
Register friends I guess

2361
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
They meet with Mevers so there may be a

2362
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,000
Number still tied to your account

2363
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:38,000
However I think they're going to have

2364
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,000
A name to that as well

2365
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Or it's going to be just one number

2366
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
That you're going to have for all future

2367
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Nintendo consoles or whatever

2368
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
So there's that and then of course

2369
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,000
That sounds a lot like the battle net battle tags

2370
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
Just so you know like where you have like the

2371
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Name and then the random numbers at the end

2372
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
So then also of course they've got

2373
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,000
The Wii U chat stuff and they said that

2374
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Of course you're going to be able to talk to each other

2375
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Using chat they say that

2376
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,000
I guess users

2377
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,000
Will be able to draw images on the chat

2378
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,000
Window while they talk and

2379
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Instant hilarity

2380
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Just add cocks

2381
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Because you know

2382
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
That's what's going to happen. What else are people

2383
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Going to draw on the screens?

2384
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
Like I'm going to have a video chat with

2385
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Loki and I'm going to draw a big dick

2386
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,000
Right next to his head and it'll be hilarious

2387
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,000
I think that

2388
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Photo I took at Fry's spells it out

2389
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,000
Which one is this?

2390
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
The one where I walked by the monitor and there was a big

2391
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Dick on it that someone drew

2392
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Of course

2393
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,000
So yeah they have that stuff

2394
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,000
Also they're saying that

2395
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,000
That I guess people can

2396
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Place calls to each other through the Wii U chat

2397
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
And there's going to be a light on the gamepad

2398
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
They'll blink to indicate that there's an incoming

2399
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Call or something like that

2400
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
It just sounds like it's very basic stuff that they're

2401
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Just describing in a very complex way that

2402
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,000
You know makes it sound like

2403
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
Oh hey look we've got video chat on our system

2404
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Now that everybody's had

2405
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
This for years now but hey it's a new thing

2406
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
And it's cutting edge because

2407
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
We're now doing it

2408
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
And then of course also

2409
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
They have the new Mii Plaza

2410
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Which is now Mii Wara Wara

2411
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Or Wara Wara Plaza which I guess

2412
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Wara Wara means bustling

2413
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
In Japanese

2414
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Was it Wara Wara?

2415
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Yes. Yeah that's going to change for the US

2416
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Yeah it's

2417
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Well actually apparently

2418
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
The English name will be the

2419
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Wara Wara Plaza

2420
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
I'm fine with that

2421
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
Which the distant cousin of

2422
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Wuhu Island

2423
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
Which why can't it be Mii Plaza?

2424
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,000
Or the Wii U Plaza

2425
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Or the home screen

2426
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Or something like that

2427
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
Why does it have to be something ridiculous?

2428
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
No it should be Mii Gusta

2429
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
But anyways

2430
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Yeah so it looks like

2431
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Basically your Mii Plaza that you had had

2432
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
On the Wii

2433
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,000
Now there's titles that

2434
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,000
You may have played in the Wii U games

2435
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
And stuff like that that they're huddling around

2436
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Which

2437
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
I don't know

2438
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
I'm not that excited about

2439
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
But whatever

2440
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Not for me and also

2441
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Like they said before

2442
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
This is going to be a day one download so

2443
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
It won't actually come on your system

2444
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
So if you don't have connection to the internet

2445
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Obviously you're not going to have any friends that are going to be on there

2446
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Well if you don't have a connection to the internet you're probably not

2447
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Going to be hearing this show

2448
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Well you may have a connection at work

2449
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Or something like that

2450
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
I'm just saying

2451
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
You may not have a connection to the internet at home

2452
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Or you know your console

2453
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
May not be in an area

2454
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Maybe you're in the dark ages and you don't have

2455
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
A wifi router or something like that

2456
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Or it just doesn't work through

2457
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Your walls or something

2458
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
You may have connectivity issues

2459
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Either way

2460
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
So you're going to have to download this as a day one

2461
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
And I believe the internet browser

2462
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Is going to be part of that

2463
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
So

2464
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
Well

2465
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Moving on into other news

2466
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
About Valve

2467
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
I know we're all excited about whatever Valve's got

2468
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Going on next even though we have no idea what it could possibly be

2469
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Although I think we're all hoping it's like Half Life 3

2470
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Maybe

2471
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Gabe Newell apparently got a visit

2472
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
This past week from

2473
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
A bunch of users from 4chan.org

2474
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Uh oh

2475
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
But the Vboard

2476
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Specifically went to go visit Gabe Newell

2477
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,000
For his birthday

2478
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
That's pretty hilarious

2479
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
And asked him some questions

2480
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
And of course there's YouTubes of it all over the internet

2481
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Newell did say no Half Life 3 questions

2482
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
So that wasn't out there

2483
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
But that doesn't mean they couldn't get some other questions

2484
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Such as is Valve working on a new

2485
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Source engine

2486
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
And Newell said we've been working on a new engine stuff for a while

2487
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
There was some

2488
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Garbled audio with subtitles that say

2489
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
We've just been waiting for a game to roll it out with

2490
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
And uh

2491
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
There was another question asked saying

2492
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Is it more than just an extension to Source

2493
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Like is it an entirely new engine

2494
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
And Gabe Newell said

2495
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Yeah

2496
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Apparently the rumor mill's still

2497
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Pumping out there on Source 2

2498
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
This is after the uncovered code in August

2499
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Wouldn't Source 2 be awesome

2500
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
For like you know launching a console

2501
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
That they would be making themselves

2502
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Perhaps with a game called Half Life 3

2503
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
That would sell a lot of consoles

2504
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Or you know whatever they're gonna be

2505
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
I want Half Life Ponies

2506
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Well the game they are making is Ricochet 2

2507
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
That was something that Gabe Newell did confirm

2508
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Is in development

2509
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Maybe that's the first game on the engine

2510
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
That could be the game for 2014

2511
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Who knows

2512
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Alright let's move on with some more news

2513
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Dark Sakura

2514
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Oh Square

2515
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Oh Square

2516
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
We need sad music

2517
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
I don't know

2518
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
What about Aerith dying music

2519
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Alright we can do

2520
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Alright I'll get some sad music

2521
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
But that's happy music for me

2522
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Aerith living

2523
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Aerith living

2524
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Aerith living music I don't know

2525
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Yeah well Aerith dying music was happy for me

2526
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Because I hated her

2527
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Should just be the sound of the sword

2528
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Shink shink

2529
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Ten hours of

2530
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
That's better

2531
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
That's better

2532
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
So Final Fantasy 14

2533
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Has come to an end

2534
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Dun dun dun

2535
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
And um

2536
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Yeah instead of

2537
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Some of the stuff that people were promised

2538
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
What they had was basically

2539
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Server farting

2540
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
They got a really nice cinematic

2541
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
I'm just imagining

2542
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
I'm just imagining actual

2543
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Literal server farting

2544
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
This is the end

2545
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Oh well this is

2546
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Unexpected

2547
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
You shouldn't be making fart noises

2548
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Over this very sad song

2549
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
This is happy music

2550
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
Remember vote for us at the podcast awards

2551
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Yay she's

2552
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Dead awesome

2553
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
My favorite part

2554
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
My save file still works by the way

2555
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
Anyway

2556
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
People were basically

2557
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Logging on you

2558
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Those few loyal

2559
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Deluded people who were still

2560
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Into the game Hey I have friends that were still playing

2561
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Final Fantasy 14

2562
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
You like what you like

2563
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
I can't make fun of anybody this week

2564
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Because I've popped so many squares

2565
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
On that curiosity cube

2566
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
I can't judge anybody I'm sorry

2567
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
What was the line from

2568
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Money Python? Don't know much about art

2569
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
But I know what I like

2570
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
So

2571
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
I'm just going to read the quote

2572
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
From one of the players

2573
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
There were so many waiting to

2574
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Log in and fight in the promised epic battles

2575
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
That Square Enix had to start

2576
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Turning players away based on subscription

2577
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
End date

2578
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
So those who were in had bad lag

2579
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Especially in menus and couldn't

2580
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Form parties

2581
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
When they actually did get

2582
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
To fight some of these epic

2583
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Monsters they were promised

2584
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
They were

2585
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
It was like these

2586
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Level 100 monsters that were only ever

2587
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
Seen in cutscenes

2588
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
They really couldn't get much

2589
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
About it so basically the last server message

2590
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Just pretty much bleeped over and over

2591
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
Again

2592
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Confound contact with main host

2593
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
What a way to go

2594
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Yeah but there's a pretty nice

2595
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Cinematic up on Kotaku so go watch that

2596
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
That's the only good thing to ever come out of Final Fantasy 14

2597
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Actually by pretty nice

2598
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
Pretty fucking amazing

2599
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
If you do watch the mag it's pretty epic

2600
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
I'm very curious about

2601
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
This realm reborn

2602
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
I can't believe they went so far

2603
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
As to just pull the fucking plug on 14

2604
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
As it was and saying alright

2605
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Hold up you guys we got this

2606
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Just give us about 6 months to get it up and running again

2607
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
Crazy

2608
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,000
Alright we'll just do a real

2609
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Update this time instead of just

2610
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Poopooing out something

2611
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,000
Alright well we'll see what happens

2612
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
If it was worth the wait or if it is

2613
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Poopoo

2614
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
In the meantime something a little closer

2615
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
To look forward to this week's release dates

2616
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Oh my god

2617
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
There's a little bit happening in the states this week

2618
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Just a tad

2619
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Bit considering that we've got the Wii U

2620
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
Launched so there's like every god damn

2621
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
Game coming out on the Wii U

2622
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
All at one time let's talk about the big stuff

2623
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
First of course obviously

2624
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
The biggest game of the year

2625
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
And this is probably by sales this is not

2626
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
Necessarily unpopularity but it is pretty popular

2627
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
As well Call of Duty Black Ops 2

2628
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Coming out on

2629
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,000

2630
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
The Wii U

2631
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
And PC

2632
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
And very big title

2633
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Very popular of course the Care Package

2634
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
And

2635
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Hardened editions of that as well

2636
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Coming out this week

2637
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
And the Care Package with that quadcopter

2638
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
Which looks cool

2639
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
But I guarantee is very cheap

2640
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Cause they usually

2641
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Forget who they source to make that stuff

2642
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
But it's been the same company each year

2643
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
They make kids toys folks

2644
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Just saying

2645
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Also

2646
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000

01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
THQ cause I'm not doing very well

2705
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000

2706
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:10,000

on PS3 this week

2708
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Should've just been reading Rainbow

2709
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
You sure it's not Superbook?

2710
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
You know where it takes you to Jesus times?

2711
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
No

2712
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000

2718
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000

01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,000
We've also got

2723
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:44,000
What else here

2724
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:46,000
I know

2725
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,000
I'm forgetting some stuff here

2726
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000

01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
as well

2731
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
And remember that also has Wreck-It Ralph in there

2732
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Nice little tie-in

2733
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Game Party Champions

2734
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
There's that striking when the iron's hot

2735
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
two weeks after release

2736
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
There's that kind of Sugar Rush game

2737
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:12,000
but not quite, it's with Sonic and some other people

2738
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
and Danica Patrick

2739
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
for some

2740
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
god

01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000

2745
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000

2746
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
Transformers Prime on the Wii U

2747
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Wipeout 3 on the Wii U

2748
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Not the cool Wipeout 3

2749
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
but the one based off the TV show that no one cares about

2750
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
Funky Barnum

2751
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
There was a TV show

2752
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
It's like a Takashi's castle

2753
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
but Americanized

2754
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
It's not good, don't worry about it

2755
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
That's awful

2756
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,000
With a lot of weird sound effects

2757
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Can we talk Skylanders Giants for a minute?

2758
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
I went to Toys R Us randomly the other day

2759
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Oh my god

2760
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,000
There was just an entire

2761
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,000
wall filled with

2762
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,000
all that stuff

2763
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Dang, they are making bank off

2764
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
Whoever thought of that

2765
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:08,000
idea to charge people

2766
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
$15 for on disk locked content

2767
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
by throwing in a Happy Meal toy

2768
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Oh my god, billionaire

2769
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Billionaire

2770
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Imagine though, flash forward

2771
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:20,000
7 months from now

2772
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
in Disney Infinity

2773
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
and how fucking ridiculous

2774
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
that's gonna get

2775
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
I can't wait to own it all

2776
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
I'm gonna be one of those mothers

2777
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
banging down the McDonald's door

2778
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I want my beanie baby

2779
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Rob wants to be the very best

2780
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Alright

2781
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Almost done here

2782
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000

on the Wii U

2792
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
That's the only reason for me to want that system

2793
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
That is a pretty awesome game

2794
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Tekken Tag Tournament 2

2795
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000

and for

2803
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
the love of god, that is it

2804
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Alright, let's go

2805
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
There's a lot of talk in our chat room

2806
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
I want to acknowledge the chat at live.vognetwork.com

2807
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
kind of talking about Final Fantasy 14

2808
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
to Jamie's story

2809
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Stan in chat asks

2810
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:38,000
So Final Fantasy 14 is completely dead now

2811
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
or is reborn replacing it?

2812
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
The latter, reborn is replacing it

2813
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
and yes, 14 is dead now

2814
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
There is this gap happening

2815
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
and YYR mentions it a little earlier in chat

2816
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
with, what did he say?

2817
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
They're really going to have to start over

2818
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Shouldn't they have wanted to at least retain

2819
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
the small audience they had?

2820
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
They are hoping they'll come back

2821
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
and I think the ones that were

2822
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
loyal to 14 until the very end

2823
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
I think they will come back

2824
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
I mean, for them to have held out on that game that long

2825
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,000
they'll come back

2826
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Here's my prediction for the whole thing

2827
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
I'll come back when they make 11

2828
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
free to play

2829
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
I'll withhold judgement until I see it

2830
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
You know, if 14

2831
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,000
the real one

2832
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,000
which is really what this is now

2833
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
I know they're calling it reborn

2834
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
but they want us to see it as Final Fantasy 14

2835
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
No, really this time

2836
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:30,000
If it's a good game, then it's a good game

2837
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
and I've got to play a good game, right?

2838
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
We'll see

2839
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Alright, anyhow, moving to

2840
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Japan and the releases over there

2841
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
there's quite a bit over there as well

2842
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Assassin's Creed 3 gets its Japanese release on the 15th

2843
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000

Season 2 and what they call the Ultimate Collection

2846
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
which is both

2847
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Need for Speed Most Wanted gets a Criterion

2848
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
release, Nike and Connect

2849
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Training and Steins Gate

2850
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Hiyoko Ruri no Darling

2851
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,000
also gets a price reduction as well

2852
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
so lots of price reductions and

2853
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Assassin's Creed 3, just in time for

2854
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000

Need for Speed Most Wanted and

2857
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Dream Club Complete

2858
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Edi Pion gets a release

2859
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
that's from D3 on the Playstation 3

2860
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Going to the handhelds on the

2861
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000

2867
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
in Cosmic Red and Sapphire Blue

2868
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
I remember reading about those earlier

2869
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,000
those are finally seeing their release in Japan this week

2870
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,000
so if you've been waiting for that pretty blue

2871
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
PS Vita, Shane, there it is

2872
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000

2876
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,000

Clean the toilets!

2878
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,000
Change the firewood!

2879
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,000
It's a game to teach you how to clean your house

2880
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
That'd be hilarious

2881
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
On the 3DS

2882
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Clean your house, or else no man will love you

2883
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Stop it

Endou Mamoru Densetsu

2887
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
and Monster Hunter 3G

2888
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
gets a price reduction

2889
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,000
that might be of interest to some people

2890
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Now, I'm looking at this and I don't think

2891
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
this is like Cinderella like the fairy tale

2892
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,000
This girl dressed up

2893
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
in the little Playboy bunny outfit and pink

2894
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
skirt, that's not what I think of

2895
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
and I think of Cinderella

2896
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
It looks like overtly shoujo manga style

2897
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
Yeah, so I don't think

2898
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Disney Cinderella

2899
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
I'm thinking something else

2900
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Isn't the lesson still the same?

2901
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Cinderella's lesson was if you want that man

2902
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
you go get him

2903
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
And you take lots of drugs

2904
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
so you think that you're being

2905
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
met by fairy godmothers

2906
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
There's no Q

2907
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
16th we have Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed

2908
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
and Sims 3 The Seasons

2909
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
You know what?

2910
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
I quit Sims 3 after World Adventures

2911
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
because I had way too much

2912
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
custom content that it lagged my game

2913
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
It was really

2914
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
El Cubo is the re-release

2915
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,000
of the GameCube, the Latin America version

2916
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,000
For England

2917
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
Well

2918
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
they like to mix it up a bit

2919
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Somehow I don't think that's Castilian

2920
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Spanish

2921
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Hey, I may be an expert in Spanish

2922
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,000
but that sounds pretty sound to me

2923
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,000
El anything

2924
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
is Spanish

2925
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
It could be Portuguese

2926
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
It could be

2927
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Or it could be

2928
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Moving On With More News, the classic game of the week

2929
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
coming up real soon

2930
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Alright

2931
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
As I kind of alluded to earlier

2932
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:12,000
with the need to sell some of those

2933
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,000
combo packs for UFC

2934
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
THQ is not doing real well

2935
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
In fact you may remember that

2936
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
a while ago they actually had

2937
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
unsplit

2938
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
their stocks, a reverse

2939
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
stock split, 10 to 1

2940
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
taking all their, you know, 51 cent

2941
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
share stocks and

2942
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
combining them together to equal

2943
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:34,000
$5.16 share

2944
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,000
stocks

2945
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
You know, because their stock price

2946
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
fell so low that it was going to be delisted

2947
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Problem is

2948
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Now their stock has dropped

2949
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
down to $1.74

2950
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
42%

2951
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
So

2952
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
If you think about it

2953
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
those stocks really wouldn't be worth crap

2954
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
They'd be worth like $0.17

2955
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Good times

2956
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
Good times, yeah

2957
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
So that is unfortunate

2958
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,000
And of course I'm sure it's not helping by the fact that

2959
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
a lot of those

2960
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
games have kind of

2961
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
You know, oh I'm sorry

2962
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
It closed down to $1.50

2963
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
It dropped even further

2964
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
So 50%

2965
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
It's probably not helping that a lot of the games

2966
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
that they were going to be coming out with

2967
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
have been delayed

2968
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
I understand why they're doing it

2969
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
It's admirable

2970
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,000
but at the same time

2971
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
I'm kind of wondering

2972
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Damn, I hope you guys survive

2973
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
all these delays

2974
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Well what's interesting, Legend of Zaku in our chatroom

2975
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
at live.vognetwork.com says

2976
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Seriously, they'll be dead in six months

2977
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:43,000
But Shadow Next Gen follows that up with

2978
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
people said that six months ago

2979
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
That's true, and the whole thing now

2980
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
is that they want to

2981
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
focus on quality, which is great

2982
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
So South Park, Metro Last Light, and

2983
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
Company of Heroes 2 have all been delayed

2984
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,000
to the next fiscal year

2985
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
So that doesn't necessarily mean that

2986
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
they're not coming out, it just means that they're

2987
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,000
delayed a few months

2988
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:05,000
because originally this stuff was supposed to come out in the first quarter

2989
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,000
of 2013

2990
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
and even as

2991
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,000
I alluded to

2992
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
they were saying

2993
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
When I joined THQ, the company made a public commitment

2994
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,000
to the quality of titles

2995
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,000
and we've always expected that

2996
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,000
in some cases this would mean that more time

2997
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:23,000
would be needed to make sure that every title

2998
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
is of the highest possible quality

2999
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:27,000
and our fourth quarter releases

3000
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,000
are the first titles that I have

3001
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,000
that have the ability to

3002
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
materially impact an experience

3003
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
told me that

3004
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
games needed additional

3005
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
development time to be market ready

3006
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Thank you for releasing games that

3007
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
are polished as opposed to

3008
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
just putting them out there because

3009
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
eh, we won't make money

3010
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
So let's hope that that actually

3011
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
pays off and these games are even

3012
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
better than what they would have been had they just

3013
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
put them out when they were

3014
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
ready to put them out

3015
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
So we'll see

3016
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
However, that's still not helping the fact that they

3017
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
defaulted on their 50 million dollar loan

3018
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
that they had

3019
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
with Wells Fargo

3020
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
So, not

3021
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
too good

3022
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Sad trombone

3023
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Yes, so apparently they had

3024
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
borrowed I guess 21 million

3025
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
dollars from the credit that they had

3026
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
and

3027
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
I guess they had like this 50 million

3028
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
dollar revolving credit and

3029
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
yeah, not good

3030
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
so

3031
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
Hopefully they will be able to

3032
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
recoup from all these losses and stuff

3033
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
and put out some good games

3034
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
I mean after all, South Park looks awesome

3035
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
I'm not a big fan of Company of Heroes

3036
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:41,000
but Metro Last Light looks pretty sweet

3037
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
And you need a Saints Row 4

3038
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,000
Right? That's what Rama in our chat room

3039
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
just said

3040
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Rama in the chat, they better

3041
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
give me my Saints Row 4 before

3042
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:53,000
they go down like the claims

3043
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Saints Row, you know

3044
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
what they were planning to do with that, the whole

3045
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
enter the dominatrix thing, which to be honest

3046
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
looked like shit

3047
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000
I would have still bought it, but it still looks like shit

3048
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,000
but they're making a fourth

3049
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:07,000
game that's supposed to be better

3050
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
but at the same time they're saying they're kind of incorporating

3051
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:11,000
all the stuff that was going to be in Saints Row

3052
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
you know, enter the dominatrix

3053
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
so it makes me worry that Saints Row

3054
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
4 is going to just kind of feel like an expansion

3055
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,000
on 3, which

3056
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
not different enough for me, but I still

3057
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
will buy it because I like Saints Row

3058
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:25,000
but I will still be pissed off if it's just

3059
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
a cash grab like the other

3060
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
games have been, but hopefully they kind of learn from their

3061
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
lesson, or didn't learn from their lesson because they made a lot

3062
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
of money off of all the DLC

3063
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Alright, let's move on to some

3064
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:37,000
announcements from Blizzard, who also had an earnings

3065
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
call this week, Starcraft

3066
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
2 Heart of the Swarm, this expansion

3067
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
they've been working on for quite a while

3068
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
is finally due out in the first

3069
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,000
half of 2013

3070
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
that's according to Mike Morhaime, who is the head

3071
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
of Blizzard, he did make that announcement during

3072
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Activision's earnings call, saying that they are

3073
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
quote, working hard towards a first half

3074
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
2013 launch, that wouldn't be

3075
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
too surprising to anyone who's been following Blizzard

3076
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:01,000
for a while, they put out two big games

3077
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,000
this year already between Diablo 3 and

3078
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Mists of Pandaria, so them

3079
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
holding onto this for 2013 is no

3080
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:09,000
surprise at all, I would think though it's

3081
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
going to happen after the end of the fiscal quarter

3082
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:13,000
to give them something to buoy up the next

3083
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:15,000
fiscal year, but we'll see

3084
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:17,000
we'll see, speaking of Diablo

3085
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
3, they have surpassed 10 million

3086
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,000
sold, and it was confirmed

3087
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:23,000
to I'm sure no one's surprise

3088
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:25,000
an expansion for Diablo 3

3089
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,000
is in the works, I'd be

3090
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,000
very curious to see how that expansion

3091
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:31,000
does though, because let's not forget a lot of those

3092
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,000
Diablo 3's, well, maybe that's not

3093
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:35,000
I was going to say a lot, but it's more like

3094
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,000
a million came through that annual

3095
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,000
pass, and I guess 1 million out of 10 million

3096
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
still 10% is pretty

3097
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:43,000
you know, but I'd be very curious

3098
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Diablo 3 hasn't exactly had the warmest

3099
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
reception either, it has its

3100
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
fans, certainly, but I

3101
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
just don't hear about it the same way

3102
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
I heard the enthusiasm for Diablo 2

3103
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:55,000
and I know some Diablo fans might want to challenge

3104
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
me on that, and that's fine, but I just

3105
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
I don't hear that same enthusiasm

3106
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:01,000
that I heard behind part 2

3107
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,000
so I'd be very curious how an expansion is going to do

3108
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:05,000
for them, but I'm sure

3109
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
it would be as well received as Starcraft 2

3110
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:09,000
I mean, Starcraft 2 also, you know

3111
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:11,000
it's popular, but not popular

3112
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:13,000
like Starcraft 1 was

3113
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:15,000
does that make sense? I don't know

3114
01:46:15,000 --> 01:46:17,000
also, a class action

3115
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,000
lawsuit being filed against

3116
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:21,000
Blizzard

3117
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:23,000
you know, they make World of Warcraft

3118
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Starcraft, Diablo 3, and it has to

3119
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
do with the authenticators

3120
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
apparently

3121
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,000
who are the guys that are

3122
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,000
filing this lawsuit here?

3123
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:35,000
it's

3124
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Carney, William Bates, Pullum

3125
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:39,000
and Bowman PLLC

3126
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,000
they are litigating Benjamin

3127
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Bell et al. versus Blizzard

3128
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Entertainment, saying that

3129
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:47,000
all of this is negligent and deceptive

3130
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
practices related to

3131
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Blizzard's customers' account security

3132
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
the fact that for a while

3133
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
you had to buy a keychain

3134
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
authenticator for $6.50

3135
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
technically you still do have to buy that

3136
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:01,000
authenticator if you really want to protect your account

3137
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
however, what I'm not hearing about

3138
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
in this lawsuit is, oh yeah, there's the

3139
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
free one on the smartphones

3140
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
and so forth. Don't they have a PC app now?

3141
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
I don't think so, just on smartphones

3142
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
maybe, I don't know

3143
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
I've had the smartphone one for so long, I don't know

3144
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
the claim is drawing

3145
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
against the August 9th

3146
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
battle net breach

3147
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
where Blizzard, they actually

3148
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
disclosed that yes, people got in

3149
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
they didn't get any sensitive information

3150
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
but were making people reset their passwords

3151
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
anyways, and the

3152
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
lawsuit saying that Blizzard's negligence

3153
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,000
in maintaining proper

3154
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
security protocols is resulting

3155
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
in deceptive upselling

3156
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
so in other words, because Blizzard

3157
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
can't protect their shit, or is

3158
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
negligent in protecting their shit, they're selling

3159
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
you an authenticator so that

3160
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:49,000
they're making you buy this to protect

3161
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:51,000
your shit. That's gonna get thrown out because

3162
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
honestly, my

3163
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
I've had an authenticator

3164
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
for years and it hasn't done

3165
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
a damn thing for

3166
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
anyone getting it and getting any information

3167
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,000
that had, the authenticator

3168
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
had nothing to do with it

3169
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
it wasn't

3170
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
like, I think that

3171
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:11,000
they got encrypted data

3172
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
was it nothing solid? And it was anything

3173
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:15,000
that could have been changed immediately

3174
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
that wouldn't have changed his present level of

3175
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,000
security. Well, here's the thing though

3176
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,000
I mean, as much as I do think

3177
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
I agree with you, it's gonna get thrown out of court

3178
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:25,000
but I would like to know

3179
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
why were so many Blizzard

3180
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:29,000
accounts hacked before authenticators

3181
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
before the mobile authenticator

3182
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
came out? Because there was about a year gap

3183
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:35,000
where you only had the

3184
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:37,000
$6.50 ones, and as a Warcraft

3185
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
player, I did feel like

3186
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
why are they making me buy an

3187
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
authenticator when they can't protect my shit?

3188
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
You know, and I was like

3189
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
why are so many people getting hacked? What happened

3190
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
here? How did all our passwords get out?

3191
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
I kinda would like that to come to light

3192
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
I would like to know, how many million people

3193
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
have had to call Blizzard because of an account breach?

3194
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
Granted, I think

3195
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,000
that the authenticator was more put out as something

3196
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,000
that was for peace of mind

3197
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
because I've done remote work

3198
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
where I had to have an onsite

3199
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
authenticator to get into the server

3200
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
so it's basically an added

3201
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
layer of protection on

3202
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
user side. I think that

3203
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
it doesn't really matter

3204
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
how much security you

3205
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
have on the website. If someone wants to get in, they're gonna

3206
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
get in. So this

3207
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
basically just gives you an extra

3208
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
layer.

3209
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:27,000
If anything, I would think that the authenticator price

3210
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
was just to cover the cost of the actual authenticator

3211
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
I don't think they were actually profiting off of it because

3212
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
it was

3213
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
something that required having

3214
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
a device

3215
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
in your hands to basically

3216
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
pair the random numbers

3217
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:43,000
with so

3218
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,000
it's not like something that you

3219
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
obviously, once smartphones

3220
01:49:47,000 --> 01:49:49,000
came out to the masses

3221
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:51,000
and everything like that, they could do an app

3222
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:53,000
instead but

3223
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
that's probably why they had to sell it in the first place

3224
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
because they don't want to lose $6.50 on every single

3225
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
one they send out for people. Granted

3226
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
it didn't seem to help for it. They should have just

3227
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
included it in the collector's edition though

3228
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
I don't know, I don't understand why they just didn't

3229
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,000
include it. Did they do that actually in some of them? No.

3230
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:09,000
I thought that they had one of the expansions that had an

3231
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
authenticator in there. I don't think it was

3232
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
Warcraft.

3233
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:15,000
Might have been Starcraft, but I don't remember.

3234
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
I don't know, they were just handing them out at cons.

3235
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Yeah, but that's different.

3236
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Alright, anyhow, we need to

3237
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
take a time back into

3238
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:25,000
classic gaming and classic games history

3239
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:27,000
and remember when things weren't so

3240
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
simple and so much shit was getting hacked.

3241
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
At least I don't think this game

3242
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:33,000
ever got hacked.

3243
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:35,000
It stole your credit card information.

3244
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:37,000
It's the classic game of the week.

3245
01:50:37,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Every week DarkSakura goes into the vault

3246
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
and finds a classic game that she thinks, hey

3247
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:43,000
you little brats.

3248
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
This one smells like rotten fruit. Play this game

3249
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:47,000
or I'll kill you.

3250
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,000
Get off my lawn. Go play a game.

3251
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,000
I'll kill you like you're Eris.

3252
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Eris.

3253
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Hey, even in Wreck-It Ralph

3254
01:50:55,000 --> 01:50:57,000
they got it right. Murica.

3255
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
In

3256
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,000
Murica we say Eris.

3257
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,000
Alright, what is the classic game of the week?

3258
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,000
Super Pac-Man.

3259
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,000
I like this one.

3260
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
I'm surprised I haven't done it because I actually

3261
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
really like Super Pac-Man.

3262
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:13,000
Actually the thing that I linked is basically

3263
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
someone figuring out the ghost patterns in the game.

3264
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
And totally manipulating

3265
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
a full game.

3266
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,000
But anyway

3267
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
in Super Pac-Man it was

3268
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,000
the second game

3269
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
in the series that was actually done by

3270
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:29,000
Namco. Ms. Pac-Man

3271
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:31,000
was done by Midway.

3272
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:33,000
So this is a true

3273
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:35,000
Namco sequel

3274
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
but you know people didn't really care

3275
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,000
for it as much because it changed the gameplay

3276
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:41,000
really radically.

3277
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:43,000
It actually

3278
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
in the game you actually went around

3279
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:47,000
and ate fruit.

3280
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Instead of the little power pills.

3281
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
And then you did get

3282
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:53,000
special pellets.

3283
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:55,000
You had your

3284
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
regular power pills which you could use to

3285
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
eat ghosts. You had keys

3286
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:01,000
that you could get to unlock doors

3287
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,000
so that you could get to the fruits

3288
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:05,000
inside. And then

3289
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
you had super pellets. And if you got the super

3290
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
pellet then you would turn into Super

3291
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Pac-Man and could go through doors and fly

3292
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:13,000
over everything. And you had a button

3293
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
that would make you go faster.

3294
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
On top of that

3295
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:19,000
there was a little neat, I thought it was a

3296
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:21,000
neat little effect where the ghosts would kind of flatten

3297
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
down a bit to make it look like you were really

3298
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:25,000
flying over them.

3299
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:27,000
Now

3300
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
you could not eat a ghost

3301
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
as Super Pac-Man

3302
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:33,000
but if you ate a power pill

3303
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
like a regular power pill

3304
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:37,000
while you were

3305
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:39,000
in super mode then you could eat ghosts.

3306
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,000
The big thing about

3307
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
that is you also had bonus

3308
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:47,000
levels too after every

3309
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
second level. Where basically you just try

3310
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,000
to go through and eat the fruit and everything

3311
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
as fast as you can.

3312
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:55,000
With this one

3313
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:57,000
it's actually one

3314
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
of the first Pac-Man games

3315
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,000
that used the Motorola 6809 processor.

3316
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
The previous one used the

3317
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Z80. And so this went

3318
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
into the same category as

3319
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Galaxian for the conversion class.

3320
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
However, it didn't

3321
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,000
really prove to be very successful

3322
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
because it was actually

3323
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:19,000
very different than the usual

3324
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
gameplay. It was kind of fucking weird actually.

3325
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
It was. Pac-Man Plus

3326
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
which was just an updated version of the original

3327
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,000
I mean kind of like Ms. Pac-Man

3328
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,000
basically

3329
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
outsold it. Midway also

3330
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:33,000
did Junior Pac-Man which

3331
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:35,000
also went on the old Z80

3332
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:37,000
processor and

3333
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
that one also went to be a very

3334
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:41,000
successful Pac-Man game.

3335
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
However, they do say that the AI

3336
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
for Super Pac-Man is

3337
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
one of the best of that time.

3338
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Super

3339
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Pac-Man has been out on a lot of

3340
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
different systems. In 84 there was

3341
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:55,000
a port for the Atari 5200

3342
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,000
but it never came out because

3343
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
the video game crashed. Why is he eating shoes

3344
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
in this level? You don't eat shoes. I don't

3345
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:03,000
know. I get the donuts and the burgers

3346
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
and the apples but shoes?

3347
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Don't eat shoes. Leather.

3348
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
In

3349
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,000
1988 there was a Dawson Commodore 64

3350
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:13,000
version that came out by Thunder Mountain.

3351
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
Did you have this file? F yeah.

3352
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:17,000
In

3353
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:19,000
96 it showed up

3354
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:21,000
on the A for the Namco

3355
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Museum arcade compilation

3356
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,000
on the Playstation. In 98

3357
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:27,000
it came out for Namco History volume 3

3358
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
and that was

3359
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
on the PC in Japan only. In 99

3360
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,000
Super Pac-Man was released

3361
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
with Ms. Pac-Man in Ms. Pac-Man

3362
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:37,000
Special Color Edition for the Game Boy Color.

3363
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:39,000
I had that. I played the crap out of it.

3364
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,000
2006

3365
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
there was a plug and play Super Pac-Man

3366
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
that included that along with

3367
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Pac-Man, Pac-Man Plus, and Pac and Pal

3368
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:49,000
which honestly Pac and Pal is seriously

3369
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,000
not one of my favorites.

3370
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,000
It also

3371
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
came in the TV Games Pac-Man

3372
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Gold edition and the Retro Arcade.

3373
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:59,000
Namco has also done

3374
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:01,000
a portable version for cell phones

3375
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:03,000
that come out on

3376
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:05,000
that are put out by Sprint.

3377
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
Sprint and Namco actually

3378
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,000
had a sweepstakes where you could win

3379
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
a Volkswagen new Beetle customized

3380
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Super Pac-Man art and

3381
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
it was on display at E3 in 2006.

3382
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
Do you remember this?

3383
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:19,000
The Beetle with the

3384
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
Super Pac-Man stuff? I do.

3385
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,000
Yeah.

3386
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:25,000
It ended

3387
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:27,000
on July 31, 2006.

3388
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,000
There was a Palm PDA version

3389
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:31,000
that was Super Pac-Man at Handango.

3390
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Whatever.

3391
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
There was another

3392
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,000
release with Pac and Pal, Pac and Roll, and Pac-Mania

3393
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:39,000
on Namco Museum

3394
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
Remix.

3395
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:43,000
Super Pac-Man is now out

3396
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:45,000
on mobile films with 3D graphics

3397
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:47,000
and better sound effects.

3398
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:49,000
And then we have it on the Namco Museum Virtual Arcade

3399
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:51,000
for Xbox 360 that came out in 2008.

3400
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:53,000
So there you go.

3401
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
Super Pac-Man. There it is, your classic

3402
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:57,000
game of the week, Super Pac-Man.

3403
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,000
I liked this one, even though it was really weird.

3404
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
It was weird. I liked it.

3405
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
You know how I feel about

3406
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,000
weird. I love that cut scene.

3407
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:07,000
He's like, grin.

3408
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:09,000
Where a giant ball of

3409
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Pac-Man falls on the ghost, they turn blue and squish.

3410
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Don't eat mushrooms! Some of them are

3411
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
poisonous! But what if they're shiitake?

3412
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,000
Shiitake are delicious. I guess that's alright.

3413
01:56:17,000 --> 01:56:19,000
I made the best dinner that was

3414
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
shiitake mushrooms, enoki mushrooms,

3415
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
and, um,

3416
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,000
I can't remember, but

3417
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:27,000
there are these other little mushrooms that kind of join at the base

3418
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
and you have to cut the base off. It was so good, anyway.

3419
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
The front lawn mushrooms.

3420
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,000
No, not front lawn mushrooms.

3421
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Alright, anyhow.

3422
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Alright, Super Pac-Man,

3423
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:39,000
your classic game of the week,

3424
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,000
in a million different Namco

3425
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:43,000
collections, as Jamie mentioned

3426
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
there a little bit ago.

3427
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:47,000
We're actually not taking a break tonight.

3428
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:49,000
We have another interview,

3429
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
and this one's prior taped.

3430
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:53,000
This is actually coming to us from

3431
01:56:53,000 --> 01:56:55,000
DJ Rama S,

3432
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:57,000
and Anime Jam Session,

3433
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:59,000
which is a show you can hear at the Voice

3434
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,000
of Geeks Network, or vognetwork.com,

3435
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:03,000
on Tuesday nights, replaying

3436
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,000
on Thursday mornings, and

3437
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000
at a recent convention,

3438
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Rama got this interview with

3439
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Jen, and she is with

3440
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:13,000
the website, I don't want to

3441
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:15,000
mess this up, it's ggvogue.com

3442
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:17,000
ggvogue.com

3443
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:19,000
That is girl gamer

3444
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,000
vogue, and Rama is gonna

3445
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
ask her in this interview some questions about

3446
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
the website, and why she started

3447
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000
it, and all that good stuff, so

3448
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:29,000
take it away. DJ Rama S will be back

3449
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
after this interview with more of

3450
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:33,000
Orange Lounge Radio. It's about a ten minute interview,

3451
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:35,000
so we'll be back after this.

3452
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Absolutely, we definitely try to get

3453
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:05,000
girls from all over the tri-state area

3454
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,000
to kind of just get together,

3455
01:58:07,000 --> 01:58:09,000
to meet other girls, to find other venues

3456
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:11,000
and genres that they play with,

3457
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
and just to have an atmosphere and a community

3458
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:15,000
that they feel pretty proud and comfortable

3459
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
in. Our

3460
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
number one passion and mission

3461
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
is to just provide

3462
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:23,000
a wonderful atmosphere for girl gamers

3463
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
and empower and inspire them actually,

3464
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:27,000
because ultimately, we

3465
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,000
girls need that community,

3466
01:58:29,000 --> 01:58:31,000
we need to find

3467
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
other girls who play games

3468
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
and just play.

3469
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
That sounds pretty cool, so what

3470
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:39,000
made you come up with this whole idea?

3471
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:41,000
To be honest, I've

3472
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,000
been gaming ever since I was like five.

3473
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:45,000
I remember having an

3474
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:47,000
NES and just playing it,

3475
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,000
and it was actually taken away from me by my uncle,

3476
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:51,000
but I was really

3477
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:53,000
a hardcore Sega fan. I'm a hardcore

3478
01:58:53,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Sega fan, up until the Dreamcast when it

3479
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,000
actually kind of just fell off the face of the earth.

3480
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,000
I mean, now they're more of a software company,

3481
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
but I always realized and remembered

3482
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
feeling that I never

3483
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:05,000
had a girl that I could always play with.

3484
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000
I went to an all-girls school, up into

3485
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:09,000
high school, and I never

3486
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:11,000
had the companionship, and

3487
01:59:11,000 --> 01:59:13,000
I saw that the world lacked that,

3488
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
a place where you could find that companionship.

3489
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
It's like, yeah, you can go to forums,

3490
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:19,000
but there isn't a specific venue that you can

3491
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:21,000
kind of just find a girl

3492
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:23,000
that is looking for a Guild Wars 2

3493
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:25,000
Guild mate, or

3494
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
even if it's just Call of Duty.

3495
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:29,000
That sounds pretty cool.

3496
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:31,000
So what makes Girl Game Evolved

3497
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:33,000
different from other female

3498
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
gamer clans like the D20 girls

3499
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,000
or something like that?

3500
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,000
It makes it kind of different.

3501
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:41,000
Well, we're not a clan, per se.

3502
01:59:41,000 --> 01:59:43,000
We're a means to an end,

3503
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:45,000
if anything. If you're looking for a clan,

3504
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
if you're looking for a friend,

3505
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:49,000
we're the place that you would go to

3506
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
in order to find that clan.

3507
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
So you're pretty much like the liaison

3508
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
to connect other gaming girls

3509
01:59:55,000 --> 01:59:57,000
to other groups and

3510
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
clans and teams and so forth.

3511
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Okay. I mean, the

3512
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:03,000
website is pretty much kind of like a

3513
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:05,000
magazine. We do previews and reviews of

3514
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:07,000
games. We do video games psychology, so we

3515
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,000
teach girls about other

3516
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:11,000
types of genre games, so if you're not

3517
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,000
familiar with First Person Shooter, we

3518
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
kind of talk about that. We also

3519
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
do kind of like

3520
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:19,000
101 gaming for moms,

3521
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,000
so if you're a mom out there and your child

3522
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:23,000
is a son or a daughter who's really into

3523
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:25,000
games, we teach you about the ESRB

3524
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,000
rating. We teach you about what games are

3525
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:29,000
good for your child. We also talk

3526
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
about games you can play as

3527
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
a mom who's not very familiar with games as well.

3528
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:35,000
That sounds pretty

3529
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,000
cool. So how long have you

3530
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:39,000
been running this organization?

3531
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
Officially, it's been running since

3532
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:43,000
November 2011, but

3533
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:45,000
it's always been a dream and a passion ever since

3534
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:47,000
I can remember.

3535
02:00:47,000 --> 02:00:49,000
So where do you see this

3536
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,000
site going? What's your vision

3537
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:53,000
for it?

3538
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
To be honest with anything,

3539
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
I don't have any expectations

3540
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:59,000
when it comes to this. It's kind of just like

3541
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:01,000
I want to do more.

3542
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:03,000
We definitely want to be able to just

3543
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
bring more women and more girls and

3544
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:07,000
more gamers into this community because

3545
02:01:07,000 --> 02:01:09,000
we want to become

3546
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:11,000
a positive

3547
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:13,000
representation of the gaming community

3548
02:01:13,000 --> 02:01:15,000
because in actuality, that's

3549
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:17,000
how the gaming community started. It started

3550
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
out with gamers

3551
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
very passionate about their hobbies

3552
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,000
and promoting it.

3553
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Right now, I'm not

3554
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:27,000
going to say it's unbalanced, but I feel like there's

3555
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:29,000
not a lot of representations for females.

3556
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
There's not a lot of places that they can go

3557
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
to to either A.

3558
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:35,000
get the kind of news feeds they want

3559
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000
or B. get the kind of

3560
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
information they need.

3561
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:41,000
We talk about video game fashion and

3562
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:43,000
we talk about this is actually

3563
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
a Legend of Zelda

3564
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,000
Fire from Ocarina of Time.

3565
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:49,000
It's a jewel, but it's been made out of a necklace.

3566
02:01:49,000 --> 02:01:51,000
We showcase things like that because

3567
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
they're important.

3568
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:55,000
Particularly a girl, if she wanted to

3569
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:57,000
buy that, she could be able to

3570
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
find it on our website.

3571
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:01,000
That's pretty cool. I like that

3572
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:03,000
concept. I just like

3573
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
the idea of it and what

3574
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
you're working with and

3575
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,000
where it's going so far.

3576
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
Outside of this, what kind of games

3577
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:13,000
do you like to play?

3578
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
Right now,

3579
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:17,000
I'm playing Guild Wars 2

3580
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:19,000
and I love Guild Wars 2 because

3581
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
I played Aeon and World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy

3582
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
and I played LOL.

3583
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:25,000
It's just

3584
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
I love, I don't like

3585
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
the I hit you, you

3586
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
hit me kind of gaming.

3587
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
I actually write for Game Tire and I wrote

3588
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
an article about the top 15 qualities

3589
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:37,000
for an MMORPG

3590
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
and Guild Wars 2

3591
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
just seems to be nailing 85

3592
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:43,000
to 90% of anything that I was

3593
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
asking for an MMORPG.

3594
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
Granted, it's not like WoW.

3595
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
WoW will always, I mean like the

3596
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
end game is just

3597
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:53,000
like the end game like Instance and Raids

3598
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
and World of Warcraft.

3599
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
You can't get that in Guild Wars 2 but

3600
02:02:57,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Guild Wars 2 has just so much

3601
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
more opportunities for you to explore.

3602
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
You get

3603
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
points and you get rewarding experiences

3604
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
for helping out and I feel like

3605
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,000
Guild Wars 2 actually has this social aspect.

3606
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:11,000
I play

3607
02:03:11,000 --> 02:03:13,000
mostly PS3 and PS2 and PS1

3608
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
games, I ain't no Sony fan, but

3609
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
I'm completely a diehard Sega fan.

3610
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:19,000
I still have my Sega Dreamcast, I still have my Gensys.

3611
02:03:19,000 --> 02:03:21,000
I didn't get a Saturn but I do

3612
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
have a Game Gear.

3613
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:25,000
But do you also have a Master System?

3614
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,000
I don't have a Master System.

3615
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
We might have to get her a Master System.

3616
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:31,000
I would love a Master System.

3617
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
I might know someone may have a spare but I'll have to double

3618
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:35,000
check with that. It's not that

3619
02:03:35,000 --> 02:03:37,000
I didn't have it because I didn't want it.

3620
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:39,000
I didn't have it because of funs reasons.

3621
02:03:39,000 --> 02:03:41,000
It's all good.

3622
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
Now, while running World of Warcraft

3623
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
have you ever reached any difficulties

3624
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
or any guys going

3625
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
what?

3626
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:51,000
You know to be honest

3627
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
yeah, but if I

3628
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,000
stopped when I came

3629
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:57,000
I wouldn't be where I am right now.

3630
02:03:57,000 --> 02:03:59,000
You really need to understand

3631
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
that you will come across

3632
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
people that want you to fail

3633
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:05,000
but you got to understand that you're doing

3634
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
something that's you.

3635
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:09,000
You are a gamer. I'm a gamer.

3636
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:11,000
I know I'm a gamer and I know what I'm doing

3637
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
regardless of what anyone does makes me happy.

3638
02:04:13,000 --> 02:04:15,000
Well there you go.

3639
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:17,000
I can't argue with that type of logic.

3640
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,000
So, when we get out of here, do you have any last words

3641
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
for any game girls out there who are like

3642
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,000
well, I don't know.

3643
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
You know

3644
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
to be honest, you can

3645
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
deny being a gamer all you want.

3646
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
But the moment you

3647
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
embrace it and be who you are

3648
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
even if you play Farmville

3649
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
even if you play a 3DS

3650
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
you know, it doesn't

3651
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
matter. If you're playing something

3652
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,000
that is immersed

3653
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
into a digital world

3654
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
you're playing a game and you shouldn't

3655
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,000
A. demote it

3656
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:51,000
as not being a gamer and B.

3657
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
you shouldn't diminish anybody else

3658
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:55,000
that's following that.

3659
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,000
The video game community is changing

3660
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,000
to include everything from

3661
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
science to medicine

3662
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:03,000
to psychology

3663
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
to even the industry booming in business.

3664
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
I mean, even fashion is becoming a big

3665
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:09,000
part of it and the moment

3666
02:05:09,000 --> 02:05:11,000
that you discriminate and divide

3667
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
yourself, you're becoming a factor

3668
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
in the divide in the gaming industry

3669
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:17,000
that me and many other people

3670
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
are fighting against.

3671
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Wow, those are some strong

3672
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
powerful words.

3673
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:25,000
Okay, so let me ask you

3674
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:27,000
girl gamer

3675
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
gamer girl

3676
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:31,000
doesn't really matter.

3677
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
It doesn't matter. What matters mostly

3678
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,000
is that if you say you're a girl gamer

3679
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
or a gamer girl and then you start posting

3680
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,000
photos with you with like controllers

3681
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:41,000
covering your boobs

3682
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:43,000
you're giving

3683
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
a terrible interpretation of what a

3684
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:47,000
girl gamer is. That is

3685
02:05:47,000 --> 02:05:49,000
the line. If you are not

3686
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:51,000
a girl gamer and you're out there and you're

3687
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:53,000
promoting that you're a girl gamer and you're doing

3688
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:55,000
very sensual, provocative

3689
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
images and representation

3690
02:05:57,000 --> 02:05:59,000
you are hindering what we're working for.

3691
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
I am fighting so hard

3692
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,000
and many other women are fighting so hard

3693
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
to give a positive representation

3694
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
of girl gamers. And if you're

3695
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:09,000
also directed to all you ladies that are out

3696
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:11,000
there that are doing this, stop.

3697
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:13,000
Because we're fighting

3698
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:15,000
through the right type of gamers

3699
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,000
and if you're hurting us

3700
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:19,000
you're an obstacle. And to be

3701
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,000
honest, we will try

3702
02:06:21,000 --> 02:06:23,000
everything possible to overrun it.

3703
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:25,000
Because what you're doing is you're

3704
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:27,000
defeating us and you're

3705
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
contradicting what we're working so

3706
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
hard for. There are people that are spending time

3707
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
money and effort. There are women who are

3708
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:35,000
spending so much time, money and effort. And if

3709
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
you're out there, just please stop.

3710
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:39,000
If you want to be sensual

3711
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:41,000
if you want to be provocative, fine.

3712
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,000
Do it without a controller. Do it without saying

3713
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:45,000
that you're a girl gamer or a gamer girl.

3714
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:47,000
Because you're putting us in a bad light.

3715
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:49,000
And it's disrespectful

3716
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,000
it's hurtful

3717
02:06:51,000 --> 02:06:53,000
and it's obnoxious.

3718
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
Wow, like I said, those are some really

3719
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:57,000
powerful words. So

3720
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,000
for everyone that's out

3721
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:01,000
there watching, listening, where can

3722
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:03,000
you find more information about

3723
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:05,000
Girl Gamer Vogue? Well, we're at

3724
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:07,000
GG Vogue, like GG's in Gorilla.

3725
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
GGVogue.com or Girl Gamer Vogue

3726
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
you can find us on Facebook, on Twitter,

3727
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
on Tumblr, on Instagram, on

3728
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Flickr. I forget

3729
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
what other place we're associated with.

3730
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:19,000
But by all means, we need more girls

3731
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
who are just as passionate and prominent

3732
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
that are looking for a place to call home.

3733
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:25,000
Most of the people, if not

3734
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:27,000
all, probably like 99%,

3735
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:29,000
they are very comfortable people. You want to

3736
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:31,000
talk about games by all means. We're

3737
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,000
associated with a bunch of other communities

3738
02:07:33,000 --> 02:07:35,000
as well. And if you want to play

3739
02:07:35,000 --> 02:07:37,000
Call of Duty, Guild Wars,

3740
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:39,000
you know, whatever it is, we'll find you a place to

3741
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
find people, to find girls

3742
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
that you can be best friends with. And that's

3743
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
what we only want to be. We want to be good friends with you.

3744
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:47,000
Wow, that's pretty good.

3745
02:07:47,000 --> 02:07:49,000
Well, Jen, thank you for your time. Thank you for having

3746
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:51,000
me. Thanks for coming.

3747
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
No problem. At least we can do.

3748
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
Whatever we can do for you, we're here for you.

3749
02:07:55,000 --> 02:07:57,000
DJ Rama S, signing off.

3750
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,000
Welcome back, everybody, to

3751
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Orange Lounge Radio.

3752
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
And thank you, DJ Rama S, for that

3753
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:09,000
interview. And especially

3754
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:11,000
Jen from Girl Gamer

3755
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
Vogue. I like her.

3756
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,000
She's really trying to do a good thing for the

3757
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:17,000
community. I like when she was talking about

3758
02:08:17,000 --> 02:08:19,000
educating people about the ESRB

3759
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
system. And I really think

3760
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:23,000
and I hope everybody's listening to her when she talks

3761
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
about how, you know,

3762
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:27,000
our community is

3763
02:08:27,000 --> 02:08:29,000
kind of growing and really embraced

3764
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:31,000
that, you know, you've got all these different types

3765
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:33,000
of casual gamers and gaming is something

3766
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
they do in all these different industries and so forth.

3767
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
So, yeah.

3768
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:39,000
Thanks to

3769
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
Rama for getting that interview for us.

3770
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:43,000
And thanks to Jen for being on the show,

3771
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:45,000
even though maybe she didn't know she was going to be on Orange Lounge Radio

3772
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
when she first did that interview.

3773
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
So, a big thank you all around.

3774
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:51,000
And I want to get

3775
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:53,000
our listeners thinking about this.

3776
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:55,000
Because I really liked what just

3777
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,000
happened there. I like that a listener

3778
02:08:57,000 --> 02:08:59,000
kind of contributed that

3779
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:01,000
particular segment. And it gave us

3780
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
something to play on the show that

3781
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
we could actually put on the podcast

3782
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
that was interesting to listen to.

3783
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:09,000
And it was, you know, something a little different and the listener

3784
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,000
created. So, we

3785
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
want to try, come December

3786
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
or so forth, we would like to try

3787
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:17,000
opening up our breaks

3788
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
to listener created content.

3789
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:21,000
Now, that particular

3790
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:23,000
piece was a little bit long.

3791
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
But we're talking, think about something maybe

3792
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
a minute and a half to two minutes long.

3793
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
Maybe a news update

3794
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:31,000
on a particular game or series that you enjoy.

3795
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:33,000
Or, you know, maybe

3796
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:35,000
some community updates for a particular

3797
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:37,000
community that you're a fan of.

3798
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:39,000
Or something along those lines.

3799
02:09:39,000 --> 02:09:41,000
We're not going to start playing those next week.

3800
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:43,000
But it's something we're looking at for December.

3801
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:45,000
Something where the users create content.

3802
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:47,000
Now, I do want to be clear on a few

3803
02:09:47,000 --> 02:09:49,000
things.

3804
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
You won't be able to actually represent

3805
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
OLR and go get

3806
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
interviews and say, oh, my interview is going to be

3807
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:57,000
on OLR. No, no, that's

3808
02:09:57,000 --> 02:09:59,000
for myself, Dark Soccer, and Loki to do.

3809
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:01,000
But, you know, talk to us

3810
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,000
if you have some ideas along those lines.

3811
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:05,000
We'll see what we can arrange. We just, you know, if

3812
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:07,000
you're going to represent OLR, we have to make sure that you're

3813
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,000
not going to do something that could

3814
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
anger a potential guest or what have you.

3815
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:13,000
So, just be thinking about that.

3816
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
We'll give you more details in the coming weeks.

3817
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
But that's something we're hoping

3818
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
to do on the show is institute

3819
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:21,000
user-created content

3820
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:23,000
in our breaks. So, awesome.

3821
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
And remember, I am

3822
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
Omega.

3823
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
Damn, apparently

3824
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:31,000
the live listeners lost the feed for a moment

3825
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
while I was making that pitch. But once again,

3826
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:35,000
we're looking at doing listener-created content

3827
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:37,000
during the breaks instead of music in little

3828
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
two-minute chunks or less

3829
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:41,000
for, you know, whatever community it is

3830
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:43,000
that you're passionate about. After all,

3831
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:45,000
it's the show where every gamer has a

3832
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
voice, and I think we've been neglecting

3833
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:49,000
one big way to get

3834
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
your voices on the show. Yeah,

3835
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
OLR reporters, OLR freelancers.

3836
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
I'm loving those terms in chat. Perfect.

3837
02:10:55,000 --> 02:10:57,000
So, more information to come in the

3838
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
coming weeks. That's something we want to implement in

3839
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,000
January, or excuse me, December.

3840
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:03,000
Meanwhile, let's

3841
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,000
get back into some rapid-fire

3842
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:07,000
news. Loki, start us off.

3843
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
Alright. So, let's see.

3844
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:11,000
Let's talk a little bit about Black Ops

3845
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
2 since that's going to be coming out this week.

3846
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
One of the things that they just recently announced

3847
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:17,000
before they had the whole

3848
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:19,000
streaming that you can do of your gameplay

3849
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:21,000
with the League play and stuff like that.

3850
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
Well, now it's been confirmed that

3851
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
that's going to be linked in with

3852
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,000
YouTube live streaming. So, you're going to

3853
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,000
build a live stream on Xbox

3854
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:31,000
360, PlayStation 3, and

3855
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:33,000
on the PC version as well.

3856
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:35,000
No word on the Wii U yet because

3857
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
a lot of the integration that they have with Elite and stuff

3858
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
like that on the Wii U doesn't quite work.

3859
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,000
But, it's pretty cool. Also, I guess

3860
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:43,000
you're going to be able to see the player's gamer card

3861
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
of whoever you're streaming and some other

3862
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
additional information like class loadouts

3863
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:49,000
and stats and stuff like that.

3864
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:51,000
It's pretty cool. I actually did spot

3865
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
some of this stuff when I was doing the

3866
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
local play stuff.

3867
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
They had some options for that, but

3868
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
really neat that you'll be able to live stream games.

3869
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
I kind of wish they had that for Grand Theft Auto, but

3870
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,000
that's still a ways away.

3871
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:05,000
Neat.

3872
02:12:05,000 --> 02:12:07,000
It's a neat idea. I know live streaming

3873
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,000
is pretty popular nowadays.

3874
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,000
I think that's a neat thing to build into the game, too.

3875
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
Yeah,

3876
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
I'm curious what this is going to bring.

3877
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
It's neat. Well, it's cool, too,

3878
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:21,000
because a lot of people don't have the hardware

3879
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
to kind of video capture everything that they're doing,

3880
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
so this is kind of built into the game, which

3881
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
I think is pretty cool. Well, it's fascinating how the

3882
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:29,000
industry is really embracing it, too. I would have

3883
02:12:29,000 --> 02:12:31,000
assumed there was going to be resistance to it,

3884
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:33,000
especially, you know, we talked about the Microsoft policy

3885
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:35,000
and all that stuff some time ago,

3886
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:37,000
which is kind of this strange in the middle

3887
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:39,000
place, but it is very interesting

3888
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:41,000
how, you know, instead of

3889
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
the game companies going to

3890
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:45,000
try and shut down places like Twitch TV

3891
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:47,000
and the other streaming sites, they're really saying,

3892
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
alright, this is something people want to do.

3893
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:51,000
It's promotion for our game. Let's do it.

3894
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Yeah. Now, here's a weird

3895
02:12:53,000 --> 02:12:55,000
promotion. They're doing something with Halo 4

3896
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:57,000
and their multiplayer, where

3897
02:12:57,000 --> 02:12:59,000
they're actually allowing players to

3898
02:12:59,000 --> 02:13:01,000
get Microsoft

3899
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:03,000
points for playing multiplayer,

3900
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:05,000
and here's how it works. Okay, so

3901
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
basically, if you get Halo 4

3902
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:09,000
and you play 35

3903
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:11,000
hours plus, and this is between

3904
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
launch until the end of this month,

3905
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,000
so November 30th is a cutoff for it,

3906
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:17,000
but if you play over 35

3907
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:19,000
hours, you're going to get 100 Microsoft

3908
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
points. If you...

3909
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
Whoopee! I know. Whoopee shit.

3910
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:25,000
Ooh, a dollar and like

3911
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:27,000
20 cents or something. Okay, so then

3912
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,000
if you play

3913
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,000
$1.25, that's what it was,

3914
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:33,000
70 hours,

3915
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:35,000
guess what?

3916
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
You're going to double that.

3917
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:39,000
Or, I'm sorry, you're going to triple that. You're going to get

3918
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:41,000
300 Microsoft points.

3919
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:43,000
Yay, a denomination that

3920
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:45,000
totally doesn't round out anything.

3921
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
So, you're going to have

3922
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
300 Microsoft points possible

3923
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
there for you guys.

3924
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
Also, if you happen to play over

3925
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
140 hours...

3926
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
Was this only online multiplayer?

3927
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
This is only online multiplayer.

3928
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
Halo 4 multiplayer... Matchmaking

3929
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
or customer, does it say? It's multiplayer

3930
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:05,000
over Xbox Live. So,

3931
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:07,000
I could make a custom match,

3932
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:09,000
set the timer to unlimited,

3933
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:11,000
have it run all day,

3934
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,000
have me and my friends set up a custom match

3935
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:15,000
have the timer run all day, and I could do that, right?

3936
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:17,000
If I wanted to be...

3937
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
I don't know if they'd let you do that.

3938
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
I mean, it would be a big waste of time,

3939
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
but I guess I suppose you could do that.

3940
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
Also,

3941
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
I guess they're also doing...

3942
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
It's going to be up to 800 Microsoft points.

3943
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:31,000
So, I'm kind of confused to where they're going to get this

3944
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
800 Microsoft points, I guess.

3945
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:35,000
Oh, I'm sorry, the extra

3946
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:37,000
200 is coming from spending

3947
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:39,000
at least 3,000 Microsoft points on the

3948
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,000
Halo Marketplace content.

3949
02:14:41,000 --> 02:14:43,000
Woohoo,

3950
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
200 points back after spending...

3951
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:47,000
So, it's like a dinky two-buck rebate.

3952
02:14:47,000 --> 02:14:49,000
Yeah, 3,000 Microsoft

3953
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:51,000
points, which is the

3954
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,000
equivalent of almost...

3955
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
What is that?

3956
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,000
40 bucks?

3957
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
Almost?

3958
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:01,000
I don't know.

3959
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
All the point values are just...

3960
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
It's annoying.

3961
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:07,000
So, yeah, there you have it.

3962
02:15:07,000 --> 02:15:09,000
Some money back if you do that.

3963
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
Oh, and I guess also if you...

3964
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:13,000
If you spend,

3965
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:15,000
I guess, 1,500 Microsoft points,

3966
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
you get 100 Microsoft points back.

3967
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Fantastic, I guess.

3968
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:22,000
But it is kind of neat, though, to see

3969
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,000
that you can earn some Microsoft points

3970
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
for playing a game for a long period of time.

3971
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
YYR says it's more like a thank you

3972
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:30,000
to the people who are going to do it anyway.

3973
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:32,000
I think it's just trying to get people to play

3974
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,000
a long time so that they can try to beat up

3975
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Black Ops 2, which is probably going to dominate

3976
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
multiplayer, and they want

3977
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
to have it look nice when

3978
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
Halo 4 is at the top of the charts there, but

3979
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
it's going to be tough.

3980
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
And last but not least,

3981
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
there's been a lot of information

3982
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
regarding Grand Theft Auto 5 coming out.

3983
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:52,000
All of this coming from the brand new issue

3984
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
of Game Informer.

3985
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
And a lot of details

3986
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
regarding kind of the single player

3987
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
campaign, including,

3988
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
you know,

3989
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
first off, the game's

3990
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
map itself is going to be

3991
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:08,000
over... It's going to be bigger

3992
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:10,000
than Grand Theft Auto 4, San Andreas,

3993
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:12,000
and Red Dead Redemption combined.

3994
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:14,000
It's just the

3995
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,000
largest map in any of the games

3996
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,000
at all.

3997
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
So, that's fantastic.

3998
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:22,000
There's going to be three

3999
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:24,000
different people that you get to play as.

4000
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,000
Three different protagonists, including

4001
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,000
let's see here,

4002
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
I'm trying to remember the names of these guys.

4003
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
I don't remember.

4004
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:36,000
Well, anyways, that's not important.

4005
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
But three different people you get to play as.

4006
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:40,000
Also, they're going to have some different

4007
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
locations available in the game.

4008
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,000
Some of the stuff, obviously, you've seen in the

4009
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:46,000
trailers, including

4010
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
stuff based off of the

4011
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:52,000
vineyard areas.

4012
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Obviously, Rockford Hills,

4013
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:56,000
which is like Beverly Hills.

4014
02:16:56,000 --> 02:16:58,000
Blaine County, which is kind of like this

4015
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:00,000
desert. They say they have bikers

4016
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
and meth heads in there.

4017
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Oh, goodie! Vespucci Beach,

4018
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,000
which is similar, I guess, to Venice Beach.

4019
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:08,000
Also, some beach fronts

4020
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:10,000
and stuff like that. They're saying also

4021
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
the game's going to have

4022
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
a Salton Sea region, a military base,

4023
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
suburban hills.

4024
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:18,000
There's a Mount Chiliad,

4025
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
I guess, which is

4026
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:22,000
a large wilderness area where you can

4027
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
explore all that. They're also going to have

4028
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:26,000
underwater areas that you can

4029
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
scuba dive in and stuff like that.

4030
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:30,000
They've got this

4031
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:32,000
brand new engine that has

4032
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
multi-mile draw distances

4033
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:36,000
in there. I guess also, you're

4034
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:38,000
going to be able to do all sorts of things

4035
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:40,000
from, they have a golf course that you can play

4036
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:42,000
a full round of golf in, if you really want to.

4037
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Wow.

4038
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,000
All sorts of details.

4039
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:48,000
As long as I can beat people with my clubs.

4040
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
They have

4041
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,000
bowling, strip clubs,

4042
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,000
stand-up comedy acts, TV shows,

4043
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
internet cafes, kind of all similar to

4044
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
what they had before.

4045
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,000
You can also, I guess,

4046
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,000
go to the gym. You can attend a sermon.

4047
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:04,000
They've got yoga, triathlons

4048
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
that you can do, base jumping,

4049
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:08,000
tennis, jet skiing.

4050
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:10,000
Also, they're getting rid of

4051
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:12,000
the romance stuff in there because

4052
02:18:12,000 --> 02:18:14,000
God was fucking annoying.

4053
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,000
One of the things I thought was really cool about it, though, is

4054
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:18,000
the three main characters,

4055
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
when you're switching between them, they

4056
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
go off on their own thing and do

4057
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:24,000
whatever. They'll

4058
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
go on their own business.

4059
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
It zooms out of the map

4060
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
like Google Earth, I guess, and then goes into

4061
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:32,000
these different characters.

4062
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:34,000
The three characters,

4063
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
Michael, who I guess is

4064
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
the guy who did the voiceover in the first trailer.

4065
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
He's a retired bank robber, and

4066
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:42,000
now he's kind of on the FIB,

4067
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:44,000
the FBI

4068
02:18:44,000 --> 02:18:46,000
Witness Protection

4069
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:48,000
Program.

4070
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:50,000
He's

4071
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:52,000
hiding out.

4072
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:54,000
Also, there's a guy named Trevor,

4073
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:56,000
who is this crazy meth

4074
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
head, who

4075
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
is this crazy

4076
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,000
war veteran or whatever.

4077
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:04,000
Franklin, who is a repo man.

4078
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:06,000
It's kind of all them

4079
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:08,000
coming together to

4080
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:10,000
do these heists.

4081
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:12,000
But,

4082
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
lots of screenshots. Looks fantastic.

4083
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:16,000
New trailer

4084
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:18,000
is going to be coming out on the 14th this week.

4085
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:20,000
Very excited

4086
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
by that. This is definitely

4087
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
a game I'm highly, highly

4088
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:26,000
looking forward to. No fanboy involved.

4089
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:28,000
No, no, not at all. It's the biggest game next year.

4090
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:30,000
All right.

4091
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
Some rapid fire news for me.

4092
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
Gamefly's digital PC client

4093
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:36,000
is now out. It was in beta for a while,

4094
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:38,000
but it is now officially out.

4095
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:40,000
You can download this if you're anybody.

4096
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
You don't have to be a Gamefly subscriber to get it.

4097
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:44,000
Anybody can have it. Over 1,500

4098
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:46,000
Windows and Mac titles. This is sounding a little bit

4099
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
like a commercial, but it's been around on the game

4100
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
blogs. If you are

4101
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:52,000
a member, you should be aware, because I know a lot

4102
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,000
of you guys are. You can do the whole unlimited PC

4103
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
play. It's pretty much GameTap.

4104
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:58,000
In a way.

4105
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,000
Except I don't think it's a lot of the classic games,

4106
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,000
but more kind of like the games that are,

4107
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:04,000
you know, they're not super old,

4108
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
but they're old enough to not really be selling anymore.

4109
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:08,000
Like, Saints Row 2 is

4110
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
unlimited PC play. Right?

4111
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:12,000
So, there you go.

4112
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,000
Oh, apparently,

4113
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:16,000
2K games giving

4114
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:18,000
everybody who downloads the

4115
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,000
client a free copy of Bioshock.

4116
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,000
I don't know if that's still going, but it was going for a while.

4117
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:24,000
It probably only was on the launch day. It's probably done now.

4118
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:26,000
But still.

4119
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,000
I could just play that on PS3.

4120
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:30,000
That's true. Or, you know,

4121
02:20:30,000 --> 02:20:32,000
a lot of folks bought the collection on Steam

4122
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:34,000
or what have you. Anyhow,

4123
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
Xbox 360 USB data storage.

4124
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:38,000
It was capped at 16 gigabytes.

4125
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,000
I don't know if you know that for the USB storage.

4126
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:42,000
They actually raised that.

4127
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:44,000
In this recent update that happened, it wasn't

4128
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
really out there, but it has been

4129
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
increased to 32 gigabytes.

4130
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:50,000
So, it has been

4131
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:52,000
confirmed with Microsoft that this was

4132
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:54,000
intentional. So, there

4133
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:56,000
you go. That's great news for those folks

4134
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:58,000
that need to make way for

4135
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,000
data to install their Halo 4

4136
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:02,000
They should just not have a cap.

4137
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:04,000
Oh, I understand.

4138
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:06,000
I understand they want to sell their overly expensive

4139
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
hard drives for these systems,

4140
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,000
but it shouldn't have a cap.

4141
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,000
I mean, they're just selling these

4142
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:14,000
laptop SATA drives

4143
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,000
and charging a really

4144
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
huge premium on that stuff when

4145
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:20,000
I

4146
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,000
understand you can use external drives to

4147
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,000
supplement that, but only get 32 gigs of

4148
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:26,000
pop, whereas you can get 2 terabyte

4149
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:28,000
drive for half the price of like their

4150
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
320 drive. So,

4151
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,000
why even bother?

4152
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
Well, in my last

4153
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
story here for rapid fire news,

4154
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
oh, you gotta love

4155
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:40,000
porno inspired by video games.

4156
02:21:40,000 --> 02:21:42,000
Yes, Lollipop

4157
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
Chainsaw is

4158
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
inspiring a new porno in

4159
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:48,000
Japan called Tia's Geek

4160
02:21:48,000 --> 02:21:50,000
Cosplay Fuck, and I

4161
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:52,000
love that fuck is all in capital letters

4162
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,000
with an exclamation point.

4163
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:56,000
And she dresses up as some of the

4164
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
various characters in Lollipop Chainsaw

4165
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:00,000
including a giant chainsaw

4166
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
and she cosplays

4167
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
and presumably fucks.

4168
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
Well, that is true.

4169
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:08,000
It's all the same character,

4170
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
it's just all of her alternate costumes from

4171
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,000
the game, so if I remember

4172
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,000
correctly,

4173
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:16,000
and judging by the back picture

4174
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:18,000
here, I don't think she dresses up

4175
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:20,000
like anybody else. It's hard to tell because the

4176
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:22,000
pictures are really small, but I do notice

4177
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
that

4178
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
it's definitely a lot of the alternate costumes.

4179
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
Although, that one might be, no, no, no,

4180
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:30,000
that's still...

4181
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:32,000
Who cares? Naked chick dressing up.

4182
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:34,000
Exactly. She's allowed to make some mistakes.

4183
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:36,000
And she has a giant really weird looking chainsaw.

4184
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,000
That has a heart at the end of it, but I guess that's

4185
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
from the game.

4186
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
So, there you go.

4187
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
That chainsaw just looks really weird.

4188
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
Cosplay Fuck!

4189
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
Dark Sakura.

4190
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
Try to follow that.

4191
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
Well, I did get

4192
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,000
Final Fuck 10 or X

4193
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:56,000
or whatever.

4194
02:22:56,000 --> 02:22:58,000
Six mix.

4195
02:22:58,000 --> 02:23:00,000
Mental note. Ask Eddie about Dance Dance Fuck

4196
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:02,000
next time he comes on the show.

4197
02:23:02,000 --> 02:23:04,000
Well,

4198
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,000
a little girl named Maya

4199
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:08,000
gets to play Legend of Zelda

4200
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:10,000
The Wind Waker as a girl.

4201
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:12,000
Basically,

4202
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:14,000
her dad is developer Mike Hoy

4203
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,000
who

4204
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
basically hex-edited the game to

4205
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:20,000
replace all of the dialogue to be feminine

4206
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:22,000
in regards to Link's gender.

4207
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:24,000
So, instead of

4208
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:26,000
Swordman, it's Swordmane

4209
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:28,000
and Milady instead of My Lad and Master.

4210
02:23:28,000 --> 02:23:30,000
And he's actually

4211
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:32,000
put the disc image up that you can play.

4212
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
And it's pretty

4213
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:36,000
neat. I think that's nice.

4214
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:38,000
So his daughter can have an adventure

4215
02:23:38,000 --> 02:23:40,000
that feels more believable

4216
02:23:40,000 --> 02:23:42,000
to a little girl. To be fair, he's not

4217
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:44,000
actually putting up the disc image because that would be piracy,

4218
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
but he's putting up the patch file that if you

4219
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:48,000
find the disc image with a certain MD5

4220
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,000
hash, you can patch it.

4221
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
Lollipop Chainsaw stars a girl.

4222
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,000
Just saying.

4223
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:56,000
Yeah, and the game was also awful.

4224
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:58,000
That game is almost porn only as it is.

4225
02:23:58,000 --> 02:24:00,000
It's pretty bad though, but it's just...

4226
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:02,000
Yeah. How old will Josh have to be

4227
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,000
before you let him play Lollipop Chainsaw?

4228
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:06,000
I won't let him play it because it's really

4229
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
terrible. I mean, it is a terrible

4230
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
game. He doesn't get to play bad games.

4231
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
Listen, if you're gonna waste your time on the game,

4232
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,000
just go on the internet and watch porn because seriously

4233
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
it's a better use of your time than playing this game.

4234
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:18,000
I mean, this game is just

4235
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,000
lame. Next story.

4236
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:22,000
Yes. The Angry Video Game

4237
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:24,000
Nerd. Now for anyone who's kept up with that Kickstarter,

4238
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:26,000
you know, there was a Kickstarter to do

4239
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:28,000
a movie, and there's a trailer up.

4240
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
I watched it yesterday.

4241
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:32,000
And I was like, really?

4242
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,000
Ugh.

4243
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:36,000
It looks like a bad 90s

4244
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
comedy. I know, I'm gonna watch it just

4245
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
for that. But, I don't know, there were some

4246
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:42,000
parts that made me laugh, like the guy going,

4247
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
Where the fuck is my arm?

4248
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
Isn't that guy from something

4249
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:48,000
because he looks like, he looks like,

4250
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
was it the, um, the boss that they had

4251
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:52,000
in one of the Mega Man games where he had like the,

4252
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
you know, the tank body type thing?

4253
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:56,000
I, maybe, I don't know.

4254
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:58,000
Maybe he's supposed to be a really screwed

4255
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
up American Dr. Wily. It looks cheesy

4256
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:02,000
like that Gamers movie. Remember

4257
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
there's a lot of people that thought that Gamers movie

4258
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:06,000
was so awesome and then they made a sequel

4259
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,000
to it for God knows what reason. It's probably

4260
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:10,000
because they made a lot of money off of it.

4261
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:12,000
But, yeah, it's,

4262
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:14,000
whatever. It's supposed to be cheesy.

4263
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:16,000
People buy it if, you know, or if it's

4264
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:18,000
a Kickstarter, he's gonna make money from it.

4265
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:20,000
Well, um, you know how before

4266
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
we talked about Minecraft being used in schools?

4267
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:24,000
Well, another game is being used in schools, and that's

4268
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:26,000
Happy Action Theater. The big,

4269
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,000
uh, double fine green screen

4270
02:25:28,000 --> 02:25:30,000
game, um, they're using it in

4271
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
schools now to help kids with autism

4272
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
since verbal language is difficult for

4273
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
autistic kids, then, um,

4274
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,000
they use it for different types of communication

4275
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:40,000
and it's actually, they're getting some, uh,

4276
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:42,000
significant results with it.

4277
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
I think that's really cool. And

4278
02:25:44,000 --> 02:25:46,000
I'm dead.

4279
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:48,000
Alright, let's get to the FUGL Question

4280
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:50,000
of the Week.

4281
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:52,000
It's right here.

4282
02:25:56,000 --> 02:25:58,000
Every week, we

4283
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
ask a question on our fan communities on

4284
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,000
Facebook and Google Plus.

4285
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,000
Smoosh them together, you get FUGL.

4286
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:06,000
So, uh, here it is.

4287
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
Uh, in honor of the fact that we talked a lot about

4288
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
music games tonight. Our show was

4289
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:12,000
born of the music gaming community,

4290
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,000
but we know we've picked up a variety of listeners

4291
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:16,000
since our debut over ten years ago and

4292
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
our shift to a general gaming show

4293
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:20,000
several years ago. So what is your

4294
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:22,000
current thoughts on music gaming?

4295
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:24,000
Is that a genre of game you are into?

4296
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,000
Do you think it was a fad that has faded with

4297
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,000
the rise and fall of Guitar Hero in the States?

4298
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
Or is the best yet to come?

4299
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:32,000
Now, because our show is running a little long

4300
02:26:32,000 --> 02:26:34,000
tonight, I'm gonna keep this really short. I'm only

4301
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:36,000
gonna read a few of these answers, but I really

4302
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:38,000
encourage you guys to read the full responses

4303
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:40,000
on our Google Plus community, Orange Lounge Radio,

4304
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:42,000
and Facebook.com

4305
02:26:42,000 --> 02:26:44,000
slash Orange Lounge Radio. Uh, going

4306
02:26:44,000 --> 02:26:46,000
to Google Plus, I'm gonna read this one from

4307
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,000
Redertainment. Like fashion music

4308
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,000
and my exercise group, things run

4309
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
in cycles. Music gaming will

4310
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,000
have its comeback, then fizzle out,

4311
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
then comeback, then fizzle out again.

4312
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
However, ABBA is

4313
02:26:58,000 --> 02:27:00,000
forever. Preach.

4314
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:02,000
Of course you like that one. Preach.

4315
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
Of course I read that one.

4316
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:06,000
How to get Rob to read your comment.

4317
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,000
Uh, Nick M. replies

4318
02:27:08,000 --> 02:27:10,000
and said, Music is a way for us to all

4319
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:12,000
express ourselves and tap

4320
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:14,000
into those feel-good emotions.

4321
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:16,000
So it really meshes with about any form

4322
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
of entertainment. For this reason,

4323
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,000
I believe the music genre

4324
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:22,000
will continue to grow with gaming.

4325
02:27:22,000 --> 02:27:24,000
It will never die. Technology

4326
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,000
innovations and creativity will allow

4327
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,000
music-driven games to make a huge revival

4328
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:30,000
leaving the best to come.

4329
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,000
Those are some answers from our Google Plus

4330
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:34,000
community. Let's do a couple from Facebook

4331
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
over at Facebook.com

4332
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,000
slash Orange Lounge Radio.

4333
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:40,000
Uh, Matt J. replied and said,

4334
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,000
I love music gaming still.

4335
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
My rock band library has grown to

4336
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
over 1700 songs and I'm playing

4337
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
almost every day that I can

4338
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
with a close group of friends. It's been

4339
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:52,000
sad to see people leave the community, but I'm

4340
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:54,000
still able to find new people I haven't played with.

4341
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:56,000
While my enthusiasm has

4342
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:58,000
died down significantly over the years,

4343
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:00,000
I'm still very much involved because of the

4344
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:02,000
social aspect, even online. There's

4345
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:04,000
such a wonderful, but small, group of people

4346
02:28:04,000 --> 02:28:06,000
playing and it's such an enjoyable experience

4347
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:08,000
to play along to old-time favorites

4348
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:10,000
with friends or even to discover

4349
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
new music.

4350
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,000
Um, going on to some more

4351
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
answers here. Oh, I want to hear from

4352
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:18,000
this guy here, DJ Melvis.

4353
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:20,000
Yay!

4354
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:22,000
The popularity of music gaming now

4355
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
compared to 10 years ago is really

4356
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,000
night and day, or is nearly night and day.

4357
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:28,000
What propelled the music gaming crowd then

4358
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,000
was the gamer community, who propelled

4359
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:32,000
it from a cult following to something

4360
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
mainstream. Competitive tournaments,

4361
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:36,000
video footage of said tourneys, it was

4362
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:38,000
something people looked forward to and buzzed about.

4363
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:40,000
Konami, in America,

4364
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
failed to capitalize on that momentum and

4365
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
assumed the fans would eat up anything they put out.

4366
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:46,000
Instead of working with and cultivating

4367
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:48,000
their fanbase, they turned a blind eye to them.

4368
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
That ultimately killed a majority

4369
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
of their following. Combine that with the demise

4370
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:54,000
of arcade gaming in America, the tournament

4371
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:56,000
scene died and the community grew further

4372
02:28:56,000 --> 02:28:58,000
apart. Rockband is pretty much

4373
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:00,000
music gaming's last stand.

4374
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:02,000
At least they nailed the whole microtransaction

4375
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:04,000
process with DLC, and events

4376
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:06,000
like UmLoud validate its popularity.

4377
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:08,000
Go harmonics!

4378
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:10,000
Good plug for UmLoud, by the way,

4379
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
which is coming up real soon.

4380
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:14,000
Tell me about it.

4381
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
Um,

4382
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:18,000
let's see, I'll do one more here from

4383
02:29:18,000 --> 02:29:20,000
Facebook. Again, I'm really sorry I'm limiting this

4384
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:22,000
tonight, but we're just running long night.

4385
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Chiggers replies and says,

4386
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
I've been saying the same thing.

4387
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:40,000
I wonder, too, if they could do something like

4388
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
trumpet smith or sitar smith.

4389
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
I do think they need to somehow incorporate

4390
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:46,000
music theory into some of the games, though, too.

4391
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,000
Sure, it's fun to play some of your favorite

4392
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:50,000
songs by memory, but you can't pick up the guitar

4393
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:52,000
and read music and play something that's not on

4394
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:54,000
the game. For the record, there has been

4395
02:29:54,000 --> 02:29:56,000
Sitar Hero. That was

4396
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
a joke, though, right? That was on

4397
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:00,000
the Austin Powers 3

4398
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:02,000
website as a Flash game.

4399
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:04,000
But it did exist.

4400
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
Very interesting. Alright, so. Was it Austin Powers

4401
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,000
3 or was it the, uh,

4402
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
the Love Guru? It was the Love Guru,

4403
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
that was right, yeah.

4404
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:14,000
Everybody forgot about that game.

4405
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:16,000
Everybody should forget about that movie.

4406
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:18,000
So, there you go.

4407
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:20,000
Quickly, I'll go around the room.

4408
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,000
What's your current thoughts on music gaming?

4409
02:30:22,000 --> 02:30:24,000
I think it'll always

4410
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:26,000
have a niche. We have to remember it didn't really

4411
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
start with DDR or Beatmania.

4412
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
It was dance aerobics.

4413
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:32,000
But, you know, I think games,

4414
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,000
especially in America, games like Parappa

4415
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:36,000
the Rappa, and

4416
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:38,000
I know I loved Bust a Move

4417
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:40,000
or Bust a Groove or whatever they called it over here.

4418
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,000
We need to totally break that out.

4419
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:44,000
What? Oh, I know, but it was a great game.

4420
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
So, I mean, I kind of

4421
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,000
feel like there were games before, and there will still be

4422
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:50,000
games in the future. I think

4423
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,000
it, kind of like that originally, that first

4424
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
comment I read where, like, it comes, it goes, it comes,

4425
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
it goes. I think, um,

4426
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,000
that's kind of how I feel. Loki, Dark Saga?

4427
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:00,000
Now the Facts of Life theme is stuck in my head.

4428
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:02,000
You take the good, you take the bad.

4429
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:04,000
No.

4430
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:06,000
Um, I

4431
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,000
love music games, so I don't

4432
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:10,000
really, I think it's gonna just

4433
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
kind of, right now, coast along with

4434
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:14,000
a lot of the dancing franchises with

4435
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:16,000
Just Dance and Dance Central and that kind of stuff.

4436
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
Um,

4437
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:20,000
maybe with the new systems they'll find new

4438
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:22,000
ways to kind of incorporate

4439
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
whatever type of peripherals

4440
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:26,000
that they have into it, like, you know, with

4441
02:31:26,000 --> 02:31:28,000
the Wii U tablet or something like that.

4442
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
Um, I

4443
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:32,000
just, you know, I hope it doesn't, I

4444
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:34,000
assume it's just gonna keep, you know, staying around

4445
02:31:34,000 --> 02:31:36,000
for a while, because you still have, you know, a niche

4446
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
audience that's really into it, and

4447
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,000
sometimes that's all it takes is just a niche

4448
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:42,000
audience, because, I mean, look at a lot of the Atlas

4449
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,000
products and stuff like that that don't sell millions

4450
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
of copies, and you have

4451
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,000
dozens and dozens of sequels.

4452
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
Alright, let's move on with some more

4453
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:54,000
news, and then we'll get to the mailbag and

4454
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:56,000
some quick calls tonight. So,

4455
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,000
uh, Loki. Alright.

4456
02:31:58,000 --> 02:32:00,000
So, let's talk a little bit about

4457
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:02,000
some really weird

4458
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
patents, and

4459
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:06,000
Microsoft has one now

4460
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:08,000
that, it's basically this kind of

4461
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,000
DRM system that's gonna use

4462
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:12,000
a Kinect-like camera

4463
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,000
to basically monitor

4464
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:16,000
the number of users that are watching

4465
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:18,000
a display of a certain performance

4466
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
or content or whatever,

4467
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:22,000
and, um,

4468
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:24,000
basically, you know,

4469
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:26,000
tracking the faces of those

4470
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:28,000
viewers to see if they have appropriately

4471
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:30,000
licensed it. So, for example,

4472
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:32,000
I mean, it

4473
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,000
sounds kind of stupid, but, like, let's say

4474
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:36,000
I rented a movie or something like that,

4475
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,000
and then I have to go to the bathroom

4476
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
and I leave, that the movie would

4477
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,000
stop or something because I'm no

4478
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
longer in the room, and it's like, oh, shit, the person

4479
02:32:44,000 --> 02:32:46,000
that, you know,

4480
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:48,000
registered this content is no longer in the

4481
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:50,000
room. I mean, that sounds a little ridiculous,

4482
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:52,000
but,

4483
02:32:52,000 --> 02:32:54,000
I mean, I don't know if this is

4484
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
necessarily gonna be something that they do.

4485
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:58,000
Um, you know,

4486
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:00,000
mentions, I guess, gaming and gaming

4487
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:02,000
media, also mobile devices.

4488
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,000
Maybe my thought is that

4489
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:06,000
it's like, you know, your computer

4490
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:08,000
will lock, I mean, they have it right

4491
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:10,000
now already with, like, some of those

4492
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:12,000
biometric sensors and

4493
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
stuff, but maybe it's something where your computer

4494
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,000
will lock down if, like,

4495
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:18,000
you know, it doesn't recognize you. Although

4496
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:20,000
that's gonna suck if you get in a car accident and your face

4497
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
gets defigured, but, you know,

4498
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:24,000
I don't know. Or, you know, um, I know

4499
02:33:24,000 --> 02:33:26,000
a lot of the live listeners are complaining that the

4500
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
OLR feed is going up, what did they say?

4501
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:30,000
Uh, Raginator said, OLR is going

4502
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:32,000
down faster and more frequently than

4503
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
White House interns when Clinton was in office.

4504
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:36,000
Well, you know, I like to,

4505
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:38,000
uh, grow and shave a beard

4506
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:40,000
pretty frequently as well.

4507
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:42,000
I like having a beard,

4508
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:44,000
but then I'll shave it when I have to do Rocky

4509
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,000
or something, an onstage part that requires me to

4510
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
shave it. So, you know,

4511
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:50,000
how's that gonna pick that up?

4512
02:33:50,000 --> 02:33:52,000
I'm gonna put it this way. It's not that sophisticated.

4513
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,000
It's basically looking at

4514
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,000
facial geometry, like, you know,

4515
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,000
the proportions between, you know, space

4516
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:00,000
between your eyes. So the, you know, bone

4517
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
structure and that kind of stuff. It's like, okay,

4518
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,000
your face is this wide, your eyes are this far

4519
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:06,000
apart. Yeah, but that technology's not gonna work.

4520
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:08,000
That's the problem. The, you know,

4521
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:10,000
the Kinect was supposed to do all this stuff

4522
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:12,000
and it doesn't really work in

4523
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,000
the real world. And who really likes signing

4524
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
into Xbox Live

4525
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:18,000
by staring at the Kinect for

4526
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:20,000
like 30 seconds?

4527
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,000
Or hitting A and signing

4528
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:24,000
in, like, you know, right away?

4529
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:26,000
I really hope this technology is only

4530
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
being patented to harness it

4531
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,000
so that nobody can ever use it.

4532
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:32,000
That is my real true hope.

4533
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:34,000
But I'm not gonna hold my breath.

4534
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:38,000
We'll see.

4535
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:40,000
We had news earlier in the year that

4536
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,000
Nintendo Power was gonna be having its last

4537
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:44,000
issue ever. And, uh,

4538
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
guess what? PlayStation,

4539
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
the official magazine, following right behind.

4540
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
The holiday 2012

4541
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,000
issue will be the last issue of the official,

4542
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:54,000
or, excuse me, PlayStation, the

4543
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:56,000
official magazine.

4544
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
That is not long after Future

4545
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
US, who also published Nintendo Power,

4546
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
announced that shutdown.

4547
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
So, uh, bye-bye.

4548
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
Magazine's

4549
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
going bye-bye. There's two.

4550
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:10,000
Out the door.

4551
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,000
It's unfortunate we don't have, like,

4552
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:14,000
an iPad version

4553
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
of it or something that lives on. I don't know.

4554
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
Maybe. It makes me very

4555
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
depressed because print is beautiful.

4556
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
And ink smells good.

4557
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
I know, but, well, what do you think

4558
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
can be done to save this dying industry?

4559
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:28,000
We still have Play, don't we?

4560
02:35:28,000 --> 02:35:30,000
I think so. I love that magazine.

4561
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:32,000
Play better not go anywhere.

4562
02:35:32,000 --> 02:35:34,000
But, uh, what would, I mean,

4563
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
do you think this is

4564
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
something that could

4565
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
make a renaissance someday, where we get,

4566
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
or is this done because of technology?

4567
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:44,000
Well, we got EGM again, right?

4568
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,000
Is this just done because of tablets?

4569
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
I know you don't like to think about it, but...

4570
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
It's a shift.

4571
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
Somebody's gotta design the tablet document

4572
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
if we go there. It really is. The nature

4573
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
of media is really

4574
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
turning digital, which is good and bad.

4575
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
I mean, I can

4576
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
produce digital content.

4577
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
The method's the same way.

4578
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
I'm more worried about how stuff

4579
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
like that is going to affect printers

4580
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
and the print shops that rely

4581
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
on having a steady client, a big

4582
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
client, especially one like Sony, or not

4583
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
Sony, but, you know, the magazine,

4584
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
you know, it's

4585
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
just gonna put a couple

4586
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
more, you know, little nails in

4587
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
while they're building that coffin.

4588
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
What do you think about this comment from Dan Shadow

4589
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com?

4590
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
No one reads, and the internet is full of pictures.

4591
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
Speak

4592
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
for yourself. Well, here's

4593
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:36,000
something like, you know, the whole

4594
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:38,000
shift from digital, or

4595
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
from print to digital.

4596
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
Game Informer has a digital

4597
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
version. How did they get me

4598
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
to switch over to the digital version

4599
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
from print? The

4600
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
Grand Theft Auto information came out this week on

4601
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
the digital version, and two weeks later

4602
02:36:52,000 --> 02:36:54,000
on print. So I want

4603
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:56,000
the digital version.

4604
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:58,000
And so that's what it is.

4605
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
It doesn't matter anyways. I thumbed through it once, and then

4606
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:02,000
I put it aside, and then I throw

4607
02:37:02,000 --> 02:37:04,000
them away months later. Loki brings up a

4608
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
good point. Is it that need-to-know-

4609
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
right-now mentality, especially

4610
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
in the gaming culture, that might be

4611
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
hurting magazines a little bit? Well, yeah.

4612
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
Here's the thing, too. It probably doesn't help.

4613
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
All that Grand Theft Auto

4614
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
information, immediately as soon as it hit

4615
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
the digital version,

4616
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
it hit the NeoGAF

4617
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
forums, and then it hit all the

4618
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
blogs, and it hit all the websites.

4619
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
So even if you didn't subscribe to that magazine,

4620
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
unless you wanted to read the article by

4621
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
yourself, you got all the information that

4622
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:34,000
was right there. To wait for

4623
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:36,000
it to be in print is just ridiculous.

4624
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,000
Why would you do that?

4625
02:37:38,000 --> 02:37:40,000
I mean, other than appreciating

4626
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
the art of printing and all that stuff.

4627
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
And pretty pictures to look at.

4628
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
But now that you have digital versions,

4629
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:48,000
there's really nothing that's exclusive

4630
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:50,000
anymore to them, momentarily

4631
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
at least.

4632
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
Hell,

4633
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
let's be honest. It took them a day

4634
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
or two to get my digital version

4635
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
converted over.

4636
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
I looked at screen caps,

4637
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
because you can do screen caps

4638
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
on your iPod or iPhone

4639
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:08,000
or on your iPad,

4640
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:10,000
and I looked at screen caps

4641
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:12,000
of the whole articles. I didn't even need the

4642
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
digital version to read that stuff.

4643
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
So,

4644
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
yeah, it's like, it's

4645
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:20,000
kind of, you know,

4646
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,000
unless you have these exclusive articles

4647
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:24,000
that are in your magazine, and you're not sharing

4648
02:38:24,000 --> 02:38:26,000
this stuff, you know, online, and even then,

4649
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:28,000
when the print article comes out,

4650
02:38:28,000 --> 02:38:30,000
people are just going to post it on a forum, which is

4651
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:32,000
going to get posted everywhere else.

4652
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:34,000
It just, it moves too fast

4653
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
for print.

4654
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
Alright, let's move on to

4655
02:38:39,000 --> 02:38:41,000
Well, this is,

4656
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:43,000
as soon as it works,

4657
02:38:43,000 --> 02:38:45,000
this is, um, an old

4658
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:47,000
format that had a

4659
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:49,000
game released in 2010.

4660
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
Um, have you ever heard of

4661
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:53,000
Pier Solar?

4662
02:38:53,000 --> 02:38:55,000
It was released in 2010 for the Sega Mega Drive,

4663
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
or, as we know it, the Genesis,

4664
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
and it's, uh,

4665
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
like, a 64 megabyte

4666
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:03,000
cartridge. It was huge.

4667
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,000
And it was

4668
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
very well received. Now, the

4669
02:39:07,000 --> 02:39:09,000
group Watermelon, the developer,

4670
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:11,000
has a Kickstarter to release

4671
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,000
an HD version to come out

4672
02:39:13,000 --> 02:39:15,000
for Xbox 360, PC, Mac,

4673
02:39:15,000 --> 02:39:17,000
Linux, and Dreamcast.

4674
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,000
Um, the game already

4675
02:39:19,000 --> 02:39:21,000
has, uh, over 50 hours

4676
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
of gameplay, 300 locations,

4677
02:39:23,000 --> 02:39:25,000
and 800 NPCs.

4678
02:39:25,000 --> 02:39:27,000
I actually watched

4679
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,000
the, um, the little, uh,

4680
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
interview on here, and it looks

4681
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
pretty neat. There, um,

4682
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
if you pledge $15, you'll receive

4683
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:37,000
a copy of, uh,

4684
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:39,000
the game when it's released

4685
02:39:39,000 --> 02:39:41,000
for whatever platform you wish, and $45

4686
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
get a limited edition

4687
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:45,000
4 CD copy of the soundtrack

4688
02:39:45,000 --> 02:39:47,000
or a digital bundle consisting of the game

4689
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
on Xbox 360,

4690
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,000
PC, Mac,

4691
02:39:51,000 --> 02:39:53,000
Linux, one of the three,

4692
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:55,000
as well as a digital copy of the soundtrack.

4693
02:39:55,000 --> 02:39:57,000
There's also a limited edition for $125.

4694
02:39:57,000 --> 02:39:59,000
There's a hard copy of the game

4695
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,000
for either Dreamcast or PC,

4696
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:03,000
Mac, Linux,

4697
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
and, um, the Pierce Solar

4698
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:07,000
guidebook, signed, uh,

4699
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:09,000
lithograph, and three figurines.

4700
02:40:09,000 --> 02:40:11,000
There's only going to be 250

4701
02:40:11,000 --> 02:40:13,000
of them, uh, produced,

4702
02:40:13,000 --> 02:40:15,000
and as of, uh,

4703
02:40:15,000 --> 02:40:17,000
when I was reading this, there were, uh,

4704
02:40:17,000 --> 02:40:19,000
just under a hundred pre-ordered. This actually

4705
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
might be the first one I put money into.

4706
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:23,000
The game looks awesome.

4707
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:25,000
Um,

4708
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
and, uh,

4709
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:29,000
there were, uh,

4710
02:40:29,000 --> 02:40:31,000
the, uh, $999

4711
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:33,000
Kickstarter

4712
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
exclusive Dreamcast ones,

4713
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:37,000
um, have already been

4714
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
ordered, so,

4715
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:41,000
they are currently at $76,468

4716
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
out of their $139,000

4717
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:45,000
goal.

4718
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:47,000
And they have 26 days to go,

4719
02:40:47,000 --> 02:40:49,000
so I want this, and

4720
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
I think everyone should check it out.

4721
02:40:51,000 --> 02:40:53,000
Bye.

4722
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:55,000
Alright, just a few more stories,

4723
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:57,000
then we'll get to the mailbag and the FUs of the week.

4724
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:59,000
Mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com

4725
02:41:01,000 --> 02:41:03,000
Alright, so,

4726
02:41:03,000 --> 02:41:05,000
um, I think we talked about this

4727
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:07,000
before, but there was some

4728
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:09,000
whole controversy about

4729
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
the Navy SEALs actually

4730
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:13,000
helping the developers of

4731
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:15,000
Medal of Honor Warfighter with some of the

4732
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
details of the game and stuff like that,

4733
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:19,000
and it probably doesn't help that they have

4734
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:21,000
the whole DLC tying in with that movie

4735
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:23,000
Zero Dark Thirty, which is about the whole,

4736
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:25,000
you know, SEAL Team 6

4737
02:41:25,000 --> 02:41:27,000
infiltrating

4738
02:41:27,000 --> 02:41:29,000
Osama Bin Laden's camp and stuff like that.

4739
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
So anyways,

4740
02:41:31,000 --> 02:41:33,000
apparently, um,

4741
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
seven SEALs so far have received

4742
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:37,000
letters of reprimand,

4743
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:39,000
effectively denying them of

4744
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
promotion and also

4745
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,000
knocking off half their salaries for,

4746
02:41:43,000 --> 02:41:45,000
or docking them half their salaries for two months.

4747
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:47,000
Which, you know, obviously they're

4748
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:49,000
probably getting paid by EA anyways, but,

4749
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
um,

4750
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,000
but yeah, so, that's

4751
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:55,000
I don't know, I guess

4752
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:57,000
four of the seven affected

4753
02:41:57,000 --> 02:41:59,000
are still engaging in, um,

4754
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:01,000
active duty and are still under investigation.

4755
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:03,000
But, um,

4756
02:42:03,000 --> 02:42:05,000
that kind of sucks.

4757
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
But then again, if you're in the military and you're

4758
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:09,000
revealing military secrets to a game company,

4759
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:11,000
it's

4760
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,000
kind of a problem.

4761
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
This is having some huge

4762
02:42:17,000 --> 02:42:19,000
ramifications, too. This is the type of thing

4763
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
I'm hearing reported on CNN.

4764
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:23,000
Yeah. You know? So.

4765
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:25,000
Well, I mean, that's kind of like

4766
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:27,000
even a breach of security as far as

4767
02:42:27,000 --> 02:42:29,000
national security.

4768
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:31,000
You know, if you're talking like

4769
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:33,000
tactics and stuff like that, that

4770
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:35,000
your SEAL team deployed

4771
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:37,000
to infiltrate, you know,

4772
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
this compound and stuff, that's just

4773
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
you're not supposed to be sharing

4774
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:43,000
that stuff. Right. Right.

4775
02:42:43,000 --> 02:42:45,000
How historically

4776
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
accurate is too historically accurate?

4777
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
Especially when it's so

4778
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
recent, you know? Yeah.

4779
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
Well, moving on to something completely

4780
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
different. Capcom is

4781
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
apparently going to be hiring 1000

4782
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
people. That's pretty cool.

4783
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
1000 people over the course of 10

4784
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
years. But that would be adding to the

4785
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
1500 game developers that are on staff

4786
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
currently. This is a

4787
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
Capcom representative saying, quote,

4788
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:11,000
we want to further improve the quality of our games

4789
02:43:11,000 --> 02:43:13,000
by maintaining an internal game development

4790
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
team. The purpose of

4791
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
increasing our game developer team is to create

4792
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
a larger percentage of our games internally.

4793
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
Therefore, we believe that there will be

4794
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,000
no significant change in total development

4795
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
expenditures, mainly because we will

4796
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:27,000
be shifting outsourced operations to

4797
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:29,000
our own workforce. That's

4798
02:43:29,000 --> 02:43:31,000
pretty neat because, you know, there's

4799
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:33,000
a lot of that outsourcing that goes on in the gaming

4800
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
industry as well. And, you know, for all the

4801
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:37,000
Capcom is evil chats that go on

4802
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:39,000
and, you know, certainly they've made some pretty shitty

4803
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
decisions over the past couple of years. Let's be real.

4804
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
This is

4805
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:45,000
pretty cool that they are going to be bringing a lot

4806
02:43:45,000 --> 02:43:47,000
of jobs back.

4807
02:43:47,000 --> 02:43:49,000
Do notice, though, that that

4808
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:51,000
doesn't necessarily mean it's a thousand jobs here.

4809
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
It's probably a thousand jobs in Japan.

4810
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:55,000
But, you know, still, more

4811
02:43:55,000 --> 02:43:57,000
internally developed games, I think, means they can

4812
02:43:57,000 --> 02:43:59,000
kind of keep a closer eye on things and hopefully

4813
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:01,000
get some

4814
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
better products. We'll see.

4815
02:44:03,000 --> 02:44:05,000
Interesting.

4816
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000
So,

4817
02:44:07,000 --> 02:44:09,000
Capcom. Sounds like they're almost

4818
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:11,000
it's almost double, but not

4819
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:13,000
quite. So.

4820
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
All right. Well, let's get to our

4821
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
mailbag segment.

4822
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
Every week you guys send us emails

4823
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:21,000
mailbag at orangeloungeradio.com

4824
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:23,000
and we read some of our

4825
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:25,000
favorites here on the air.

4826
02:44:25,000 --> 02:44:27,000
Dark Soccer, why don't you

4827
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:29,000
dive into the mailbag head first and read some

4828
02:44:29,000 --> 02:44:31,000
emails for us. Just three.

4829
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,000
Just three?

4830
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
First of all, this one's a little

4831
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
long, but I'll try to get through it quickly.

4832
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
Hey, OLR, AZHP here. I heard you guys talk

4833
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
about Rhode Island suing 38 Studios for

4834
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:43,000
$75 million, basically assuming that Rhode Island was

4835
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000
in the right for lawsuit. It seemed like there

4836
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000
were some assumptions being made, so I wanted to clear up some

4837
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
misconceptions. The lawsuit is

4838
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:51,000
not as straightforward as 38 Studios didn't put out

4839
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
a game and we want our money. 38 Studios

4840
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
declared bankruptcy, which typically prevents

4841
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
a company from being pursued by creditors, in this

4842
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
case the state of Rhode Island. However, Rhode Island

4843
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
suit claims that 38 Studios and Kurt

4844
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
Schilling misled Rhode Island

4845
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
as to the difficulties involved with putting

4846
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
out an MMO, and because Rhode Island was

4847
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
misled that $75 million was loaned in

4848
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
poor trust and should be repaid.

4849
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:13,000
There's another misconception I wanted to clear up.

4850
02:45:13,000 --> 02:45:15,000
Rhode Island approached 38 Studios

4851
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
promising the $75 million

4852
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:19,000
loan and tax breaks if 38 Studios

4853
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
would move their operation to

4854
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
Rhode Island in the first place. Basically, they

4855
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
wanted 38 Studios to come to Rhode Island.

4856
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
This is basically like a bank saying,

4857
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
hey, we'll give you a good deal on a

4858
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:31,000
loan to buy a house, lending you the money,

4859
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:33,000
you losing your job, going bankrupt and foreclosing

4860
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
due to unforeseen circumstances, and the bank saying

4861
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
whoa, whoa, whoa, you didn't tell me there was a possibility

4862
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
you would lose your job. We want our money back.

4863
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
We're going to take your house.

4864
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
So as you guys can see, it's not as

4865
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,000
clear cut that Rhode Island deserves any money

4866
02:45:45,000 --> 02:45:47,000
at all. If you make an investment and it

4867
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
doesn't pay off, in my opinion, you should go suck it up

4868
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
and take your lumps. But try telling that to

4869
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:53,000
the governor of Rhode Island. Just my two cents on the matter

4870
02:45:53,000 --> 02:45:55,000
is HP OLR's premier gold star

4871
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
recipient. You know, I think that's a

4872
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,000
good point that he brings up, is that, you know,

4873
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:01,000
Rhode Island did, and I thought we kind of

4874
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:03,000
touched on this a little bit last week because,

4875
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:05,000
and I'm going to say it again now,

4876
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
why was it so goddamn important

4877
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:09,000
that they get this guy in the first place?

4878
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,000
You know, and I remember I mentioned last week,

4879
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
were we blinded by our sports culture?

4880
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:15,000
Where we hold these sportsmen

4881
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:17,000
that do so well in such high regard.

4882
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:19,000
You know,

4883
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:21,000
was that really Rhode Island's mistake

4884
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
possibly? And yeah,

4885
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
if that was their mistake, then they in turn need

4886
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
to pay for that. You know, I don't know.

4887
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
But like some of our chatters were

4888
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
saying last week, you know, I say all this,

4889
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:33,000
you know, and I know it sounds really

4890
02:46:33,000 --> 02:46:35,000
cold and really mean, and then I'm like anti-

4891
02:46:35,000 --> 02:46:37,000
sport. I'm not. I'm not any of those things.

4892
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
I am. I'm kidding.

4893
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
And I think

4894
02:46:41,000 --> 02:46:43,000
Curt Schilling and all them meant

4895
02:46:43,000 --> 02:46:45,000
well, but

4896
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
you know, I would like

4897
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
to do a lot of things. Are you going to give

4898
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
me 75 million dollars because I mean well

4899
02:46:51,000 --> 02:46:53,000
and I have good intentions and some real good ideas?

4900
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
Probably not.

4901
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
You're going to expect to see some things.

4902
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
You know, I just, I

4903
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:03,000
I just think

4904
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:05,000
the celebrity of it all

4905
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:07,000
is what's really to blame at the end of the day.

4906
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
But, anyhow.

4907
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:11,000
Next one is

4908
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
and I'm going to save the biggest

4909
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:15,000
for last, so. Next one

4910
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:17,000
is just a quick update on a game I talked about

4911
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:19,000
last time I emailed.

4912
02:47:19,000 --> 02:47:21,000
And this comes from Catastrophic Moggy, by the way.

4913
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:23,000
It's Persona 4 Arena

4914
02:47:23,000 --> 02:47:25,000
will not make it to Europe this year.

4915
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:27,000
I heard about that. You guys got screwed

4916
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:29,000
because that's the region locked one, huh?

4917
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:31,000
That is so messed up. And people wondered

4918
02:47:31,000 --> 02:47:33,000
why we bitched about it being region locked.

4919
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:35,000
I was a pretty big Shin Megami Tensei fan.

4920
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:37,000
I was really looking forward

4921
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:39,000
to this game and we still have no idea

4922
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
when it will be released. Only that it won't be

4923
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:43,000
this year. Sigh.

4924
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:45,000
Excuse me.

4925
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
You guys got hosed.

4926
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,000
That's really unfortunate.

4927
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
I really don't know what

4928
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:53,000
else to say except that, you know,

4929
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
I wouldn't fault you for

4930
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
pirating it at that point.

4931
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
I'm not supposed to encourage that.

4932
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:01,000
You can't really if it's region locked.

4933
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:03,000
Are you suggesting

4934
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:05,000
that people can't work around that?

4935
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:07,000
Well, you can, but you need

4936
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
a J-Tech system on Xbox 360

4937
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
or a recent glitch hack system.

4938
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
That's what I thought.

4939
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:15,000
And the last email

4940
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:17,000
comes from your boyfriend.

4941
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:19,000
Loki's boyfriend?

4942
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:21,000
No.

4943
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
Yes, Loki's boyfriend.

4944
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
That was too easy.

4945
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:27,000
Hi, Alan.

4946
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:29,000
I know you don't. Hi, Alan.

4947
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:31,000
This question is for Dr. Sakurai

4948
02:48:31,000 --> 02:48:33,000
and it's related to Mass Effect.

4949
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
So the upcoming

4950
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:37,000
Omega DLC looks pretty rad, but starting

4951
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:39,000
with ME3 proper, Bioware

4952
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,000
made some really glaring weird sexist mistakes

4953
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:43,000
both in Fem Shep's handling

4954
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:45,000
as well as her relationship soiling

4955
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,000
Kayden for a lot of shippers who don't give a fuck

4956
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:49,000
about Dude Shep. Me included.

4957
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000
Thanks to this,

4958
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:53,000
many in the fandom have joked that the female

4959
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,000
versions of Mass Effect aliens will end up

4960
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
being male face plus bad perm plus

4961
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,000
stock tits armor.

4962
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:01,000
My question is, how do you feel

4963
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:03,000
about Nereen having proper

4964
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,000
separated breasts in screenshots

4965
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
instead of just a larger breastplate region

4966
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
in her robe, considering that Turians are

4967
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
clearly supposed to be avian, reptilian, or both?

4968
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
I'm not asking if you're offended

4969
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
personally, though if you are, let it out,

4970
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
but from a design perspective, since

4971
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
they otherwise did a good job on her face

4972
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,000
and had detailing. And that's from Alan.

4973
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:23,000
First of all,

4974
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
I actually didn't notice she had boobs.

4975
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
I thought she just had plating.

4976
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
Or maybe like a

4977
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
kind of segmented chest plate type of thing.

4978
02:49:31,000 --> 02:49:33,000
Because, and I

4979
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:35,000
didn't even really look, think to look

4980
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
because of cut dialogue

4981
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
in Mass Effect 2.

4982
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
And that's what I linked to you earlier.

4983
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:43,000
That I wanted to play.

4984
02:49:43,000 --> 02:49:45,000
Oh, yeah, sure.

4985
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
You're like looking at me like

4986
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
what? Yes, yes,

4987
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:51,000
keep talking. Alright, hold on, what am I playing

4988
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,000
here? It's the groundskeeper

4989
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
on the Citadel in Mass Effect

4990
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:57,000
2.

4991
02:49:57,000 --> 02:49:59,000
Good evening

4992
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:01,000
human. It is evening

4993
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:03,000
isn't it? Without day and night

4994
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:05,000
I lose track.

4995
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:07,000
I shipped in from Pallavin last month.

4996
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,000
I'm still getting my bearings.

4997
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,000
You'd be surprised how much a trained

4998
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,000
horticulturalist can earn here.

4999
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
The nicest thing about being on the Citadel

5000
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
has to be the drinks.

5001
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
You might not believe it, but my

5002
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
species hasn't invented many

5003
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
intoxicants. I'm constantly

5004
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
amazed by human creativity

5005
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:27,000
when it comes to brewing and distilling.

5006
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:29,000
Ever had aquarian thruster

5007
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:31,000
fuel? Must be 99%

5008
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:33,000
alcohol. I think they

5009
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,000
distill it from raw antimatter.

5010
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
Antimatter alcohol.

5011
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
Excuse me for asking, but

5012
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
you're a female, right?

5013
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
You got those funny bumps.

5014
02:50:43,000 --> 02:50:45,000
Like an asari. Every time I come

5015
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,000
in here some asari asks me to dance.

5016
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:49,000
First of all, turians don't

5017
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:51,000
dance. Second of all, asari

5018
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,000
have those funny bumps that get

5019
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
in the way.

5020
02:50:55,000 --> 02:50:57,000
That's what I was trying to get to.

5021
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:59,000
That was cut

5022
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000
dialogue. Basically, you know where

5023
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:03,000
you go talk to him after the croak and ask if

5024
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
there's fish in the reservoir?

5025
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:07,000
That was cut dialogue for

5026
02:51:07,000 --> 02:51:09,000
him. You got some funny bumps, Dark

5027
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:11,000
Sakura. Shut up.

5028
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,000
Those are some big bumps.

5029
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:15,000
Shut

5030
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
up.

5031
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:19,000
You know, I actually did have a kitten stand on

5032
02:51:19,000 --> 02:51:21,000
my boobs yesterday. Did you?

5033
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:23,000
My friend drove me to PetSmart and I

5034
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
was close to throwing down 60 bucks for this kitten

5035
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:27,000
because it reminds me of Shermy, but

5036
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
that wouldn't be fair to Shermy's memory.

5037
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,000
But yeah, the kitten passed the standing on boobs test.

5038
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:33,000
Just stood there and then

5039
02:51:33,000 --> 02:51:35,000
curled up and purred. Like, okay. I'll have to hold you.

5040
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
But yeah, back to

5041
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:39,000
Mass Effect.

5042
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:41,000
So I actually didn't even look, and I have

5043
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:43,000
some of the comics.

5044
02:51:43,000 --> 02:51:45,000
I didn't read some of the

5045
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:47,000
I looked at pictures of what the female

5046
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:49,000
turians looked like

5047
02:51:49,000 --> 02:51:51,000
in some of those comics and

5048
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,000
I had the

5049
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:55,000
Yeah, oh my god.

5050
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:57,000
I'm sorry for

5051
02:51:57,000 --> 02:51:59,000
She

5052
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:01,000
doesn't look like super endowed.

5053
02:52:01,000 --> 02:52:03,000
Yeah, it's not like overly sexualized.

5054
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:05,000
I think is important to keep in mind.

5055
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,000
It's not like she's got some tig old biddies.

5056
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:09,000
You know, it's just like, okay, she's got some

5057
02:52:09,000 --> 02:52:11,000
funny bumps. That's it.

5058
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:13,000
It looks like it

5059
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:15,000
I mean, they kind of look

5060
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:17,000
flattish. Like, more like an extended ribcage.

5061
02:52:17,000 --> 02:52:19,000
Yeah. Like a, well I mean

5062
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:21,000
in general, I think turian ribcage is supposed to be

5063
02:52:21,000 --> 02:52:23,000
really high if you ever looked at the naked model.

5064
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:25,000
It's a fucking alien race. Why are we

5065
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:27,000
so, like

5066
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:29,000
in a fake video game, it's a fake

5067
02:52:29,000 --> 02:52:31,000
alien race. Like, why are we so like, oh, but

5068
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:33,000
it's not lizard accurate. Well, it's not a

5069
02:52:33,000 --> 02:52:35,000
fucking lizard. Those are the worst

5070
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
press I've seen on lizard yet.

5071
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:39,000
Well, I mean, my point was

5072
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:41,000
it's not something I noticed because

5073
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:43,000
first of all, I didn't really see evidence of it

5074
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:45,000
in the comics. And there was

5075
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:47,000
that cut dialogue. I didn't think to look

5076
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:49,000
for boobs. You know,

5077
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:51,000
I was like, okay, turian chicks don't

5078
02:52:51,000 --> 02:52:53,000
have boobs. Good for them. They

5079
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:55,000
probably regurgitate to feed their

5080
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:57,000
young. If they're based off of birds or

5081
02:52:57,000 --> 02:52:59,000
lizards, then that's kind of gross, but

5082
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:01,000
Alan is in our chat room right now and

5083
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:03,000
says, it's more of an issue that they are hard

5084
02:53:03,000 --> 02:53:05,000
and rough and scaly, but suddenly

5085
02:53:05,000 --> 02:53:07,000
soft jubilees. How do you know

5086
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
those aren't some rough, scaly boobs?

5087
02:53:09,000 --> 02:53:11,000
How do you know they're not all like, how do you know

5088
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:13,000
those aren't the slimiest tits you'll ever see?

5089
02:53:13,000 --> 02:53:15,000
Remember Morden and his chafing?

5090
02:53:15,000 --> 02:53:17,000
We'll prescribe analgesics.

5091
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:19,000
May cause chafing.

5092
02:53:19,000 --> 02:53:21,000
But, um,

5093
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:23,000
but, um,

5094
02:53:23,000 --> 02:53:25,000
I think that it's not

5095
02:53:25,000 --> 02:53:27,000
so much of a big deal. I think

5096
02:53:27,000 --> 02:53:29,000
I may

5097
02:53:29,000 --> 02:53:31,000
feel differently when I actually play it

5098
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:33,000
and see them in action,

5099
02:53:33,000 --> 02:53:35,000
see if they bounce. But

5100
02:53:35,000 --> 02:53:37,000
it didn't look like boob boobs, you

5101
02:53:37,000 --> 02:53:39,000
know? It just looked like

5102
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:41,000
a hint of boob.

5103
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:43,000
Alan in chat is apologizing. Sorry

5104
02:53:43,000 --> 02:53:45,000
I asked. I thought it was interesting. No, it is

5105
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:47,000
I'm yelling at the internet.

5106
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:49,000
I'm not yelling at you. I would never

5107
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:51,000
yell at you. I cannot wait, by the way, to

5108
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:53,000
play through Omega with FemShep.

5109
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:55,000
With Team Badass Bitch.

5110
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:57,000
Cause Aria

5111
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:59,000
and Nereen.

5112
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:01,000
Yeah, Omega has one rule.

5113
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:03,000
Don't fuck with Aria.

5114
02:54:03,000 --> 02:54:05,000
That's my rule too. Don't

5115
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,000
fuck with me.

5116
02:54:07,000 --> 02:54:09,000
Good times.

5117
02:54:09,000 --> 02:54:11,000
Yeah, and Tigerclaw is right. Javok

5118
02:54:11,000 --> 02:54:13,000
did call Solarian's lizard

5119
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,000
people and also said that

5120
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:17,000
raw Solarian liver

5121
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:19,000
is a delicacy.

5122
02:54:19,000 --> 02:54:21,000
And that they used to eat flies.

5123
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:23,000
Alright, let's get, is that it for emails?

5124
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:25,000
Yes, it is. Let's get to the FUs

5125
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
of the week. Every week we rant

5126
02:54:27,000 --> 02:54:29,000
on this show because we can.

5127
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:37,000
This is bad.

5128
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:39,000
Here is justice. Here is punishment.

5129
02:54:39,000 --> 02:54:41,000
Don't care.

5130
02:54:41,000 --> 02:54:43,000
This is fucked up.

5131
02:54:47,000 --> 02:54:49,000
I have a huge FU that goes

5132
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:51,000
to a condition called angular

5133
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,000
calitis.

5134
02:54:53,000 --> 02:54:55,000
Which some people can use

5135
02:54:55,000 --> 02:54:57,000
for cold source or canker source.

5136
02:54:57,000 --> 02:54:59,000
What they are is when you get a lesion

5137
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:01,000
in the corner of your mouth

5138
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:03,000
that forms kind of a pussy scab.

5139
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:05,000
And it happens to lots of people.

5140
02:55:05,000 --> 02:55:07,000
But the thing that I hate about it

5141
02:55:07,000 --> 02:55:09,000
you know, yeah this happened. It happens

5142
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:11,000
from a vitamin deficiency

5143
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:13,000
and basically a lot of stress.

5144
02:55:13,000 --> 02:55:15,000
But

5145
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:17,000
what I hate is waking up in the morning

5146
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:19,000
and having to yawn and forgetting all about it

5147
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:21,000
and then just it hurt really badly.

5148
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:23,000
And also drivers

5149
02:55:23,000 --> 02:55:25,000
in the parking lot and Whole Foods

5150
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:27,000
you know, screw all you entitled rich people.

5151
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:29,000
Loki.

5152
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:31,000
Fuck you to Ford in my car.

5153
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:33,000
He's breaking.

5154
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:35,000
Like, I had the last

5155
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:37,000
last time I took it in to get repaired

5156
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:39,000
which you know was about $1200 for the repairs

5157
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:41,000
I think. You know, he took a bunch of stuff

5158
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:43,000
and then broke down a month later.

5159
02:55:43,000 --> 02:55:45,000
The guy there who had this

5160
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:47,000
really weird growth on his face

5161
02:55:47,000 --> 02:55:49,000
said, oh yeah I've seen

5162
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:51,000
those cars last for

5163
02:55:51,000 --> 02:55:53,000
300,000 miles. Yeah, after you replace

5164
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:55,000
every goddamn part in the car

5165
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:57,000
four times

5166
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:59,000
it's probably lasted that long.

5167
02:55:59,000 --> 02:56:01,000
But then again, it's not the original car

5168
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:03,000
anymore now is it?

5169
02:56:03,000 --> 02:56:05,000
That's it.

5170
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:07,000
If you want to know my FU of the week, refer to the top of the show.

5171
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:09,000
It was kind of a shitty weekend.

5172
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:11,000
I don't want to go back to work tomorrow.

5173
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:13,000
Wham.

5174
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:15,000
But I guess we have to be funny.

5175
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:17,000
Alright, a couple more

5176
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:19,000
news stories for you guys and then we'll open up the

5177
02:56:19,000 --> 02:56:21,000
Skype line quickly at 1877 Game OLR.

5178
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:23,000
I emphasize quickly, we might only do

5179
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:25,000
one or two calls tonight depending on who

5180
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:27,000
all tries to get in. And of course

5181
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:29,000
Twitter topics, we'll get through as many of those as we can.

5182
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:31,000
Twitter.com slash OLR. Loki.

5183
02:56:31,000 --> 02:56:33,000
So, Silicon Knights, you remember they were

5184
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:35,000
suing Epic Games

5185
02:56:35,000 --> 02:56:37,000
over the whole, you know,

5186
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:39,000
oh Unreal 3 is so hard

5187
02:56:39,000 --> 02:56:41,000
to use.

5188
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:43,000
And they made our game shit.

5189
02:56:43,000 --> 02:56:45,000
Not because we suck or anything.

5190
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:47,000
But they lost.

5191
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:49,000
Boop.

5192
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:51,000
So on top of that,

5193
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:53,000
not only did they lose

5194
02:56:53,000 --> 02:56:55,000
but the new ruling

5195
02:56:55,000 --> 02:56:57,000
I guess doubled the damages

5196
02:56:57,000 --> 02:56:59,000
from 4.5 million to

5197
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:01,000
9 million. And on top

5198
02:57:01,000 --> 02:57:03,000
of that they also have to destroy

5199
02:57:03,000 --> 02:57:05,000
any games that they

5200
02:57:05,000 --> 02:57:07,000
have, any

5201
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:09,000
unsold games that they have

5202
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:11,000
using the Unreal 3 engine.

5203
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:13,000
So,

5204
02:57:13,000 --> 02:57:15,000
I don't know.

5205
02:57:15,000 --> 02:57:17,000
So I guess that means

5206
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:19,000
two human

5207
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:21,000
X-Men, Destiny,

5208
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:23,000
Siren in Maelstorm,

5209
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:25,000
The Sandman, and The Box

5210
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:27,000
slash Ritualus.

5211
02:57:29,000 --> 02:57:31,000
All these games I was

5212
02:57:31,000 --> 02:57:33,000
a really big fan of.

5213
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:35,000
So if they're destroying all these games

5214
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:37,000
would that mean that they have to con-

5215
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:39,000
They're going in a landfill.

5216
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:41,000
By destroying, does that mean that they just

5217
02:57:41,000 --> 02:57:43,000
get to work on them a little bit longer?

5218
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:45,000
Yeah.

5219
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:49,000
That's what you get

5220
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:51,000
when you place the blame on somebody else.

5221
02:57:51,000 --> 02:57:53,000
When, you know, really it was just your

5222
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:55,000
inability to program these games.

5223
02:57:57,000 --> 02:57:59,000
Alright, well one more story for you guys.

5224
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:01,000
Then we're going to open up the Skype line at 1877

5225
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:03,000
Game OLR or our username on

5226
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:05,000
Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. This is

5227
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:07,000
a story about Charles Hwang.

5228
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:09,000
If you don't know that name you probably know

5229
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:11,000
something he co-created. It's Guitar Hero.

5230
02:58:11,000 --> 02:58:13,000
Well what's he doing now?

5231
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:15,000
Is he doing another music game or doing

5232
02:58:15,000 --> 02:58:17,000
something else with gaming?

5233
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:19,000
Not exactly.

5234
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:21,000
It's called Green Throttle Games

5235
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:23,000
is the company

5236
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:25,000
he's working on.

5237
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:27,000
It's a mobile to TV app and

5238
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:29,000
controller. What it's trying to do is turning

5239
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:31,000
smartphone games into a

5240
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:33,000
big screen experience by connecting

5241
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:35,000
a mobile device directly to an

5242
02:58:35,000 --> 02:58:37,000
HDTV. This would be

5243
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:39,000
playable on wireless, Bluetooth controllers

5244
02:58:39,000 --> 02:58:41,000
via what's called the Green

5245
02:58:41,000 --> 02:58:43,000
Throttle Arena app.

5246
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:45,000
In other words, you know,

5247
02:58:45,000 --> 02:58:47,000
I think it's a great idea but

5248
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:49,000
Apple could knock this out of business in a

5249
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:51,000
heartbeat. It's a dangerous territory

5250
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:53,000
I think. There's a lot of people have been saying

5251
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:55,000
Apple TV is only

5252
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:57,000
moments away from doing something like this.

5253
02:58:57,000 --> 02:58:59,000
I don't know.

5254
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:01,000
That's all fan wank and Apple hasn't

5255
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:03,000
done it. My only issue with this

5256
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:05,000
and great for him to

5257
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:07,000
do something like this but

5258
02:59:07,000 --> 02:59:09,000
you can do this with any Bluetooth controller.

5259
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:11,000
Seriously, you take a Bluetooth

5260
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:13,000
controller, you pair it with

5261
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:15,000
your phone or device,

5262
02:59:15,000 --> 02:59:17,000
you get the TV out cable

5263
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:19,000
hook it up to your TV via

5264
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:21,000
HDMI. Boom. You have

5265
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:23,000
exactly what he's selling.

5266
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:25,000
Except, you know, now they're going to have all these

5267
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:27,000
apps that are within this other app

5268
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:29,000
that are basically going to all support

5269
02:59:29,000 --> 02:59:31,000
this device.

5270
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:33,000
But you can do that right now

5271
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:35,000
with any controller. In fact,

5272
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:37,000
you can not only do it with any controller, you can

5273
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:39,000
do it with a controller you already have. Like

5274
02:59:39,000 --> 02:59:41,000
a DualShock 3 controller or

5275
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:43,000
a Wii U or

5276
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:45,000
a Wii Remote

5277
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:47,000
with the Classic Controller Pro

5278
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:49,000
or something like that tied in with it.

5279
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:51,000
They have a lot of games that do support these things

5280
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:53,000
and with a TV out

5281
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:55,000
cable

5282
02:59:55,000 --> 02:59:57,000
you can do this already. But

5283
02:59:57,000 --> 02:59:59,000
they're wrapping in a nice package I guess

5284
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:01,000
so that, you know, it's easy for consumers

5285
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:03,000
to find all the games that support this controller.

5286
03:00:03,000 --> 03:00:05,000
And it's important to note they are also

5287
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:07,000
developing their own games in house.

5288
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:09,000
So, you know, even if Apple were to

5289
03:00:09,000 --> 03:00:11,000
push a button and really fuck this idea

5290
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:13,000
over, they'd still have, hopefully, some

5291
03:00:13,000 --> 03:00:15,000
solid games to fall back on.

5292
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:17,000
I'm surprised they haven't done anything like that.

5293
03:00:17,000 --> 03:00:19,000
And, to be fair, I want to throw this out here

5294
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:21,000
to give this whole thing a break

5295
03:00:21,000 --> 03:00:23,000
because I don't want to sound like I'm poo-pooing the idea

5296
03:00:23,000 --> 03:00:25,000
because I'm not. I would love

5297
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:27,000
to be able to play smartphone games on the TV.

5298
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:29,000
There's a lot I would like to be able to do that with.

5299
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:31,000
Um,

5300
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:33,000
but, um,

5301
03:00:33,000 --> 03:00:35,000
oh, that's my train of thought. Where was I going with this?

5302
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:37,000
The, um,

5303
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:39,000
Radio Guy's Worst Enemy

5304
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:41,000
Derailed Train

5305
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:43,000
I think a lot of the games, also, it seems like

5306
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:45,000
a lot of them are touch-based. Well, not necessarily

5307
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:47,000
the games that they're pitching, but like, um,

5308
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:49,000
you know, like Angry Birds or something like that.

5309
03:00:49,000 --> 03:00:51,000
I don't know what I was going to say.

5310
03:00:51,000 --> 03:00:53,000
Open Faint is like an Apple,

5311
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:55,000
or is an iOS

5312
03:00:55,000 --> 03:00:57,000
thing that a lot of gaming, you know, companies

5313
03:00:57,000 --> 03:00:59,000
use to plug into their games to do online

5314
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:01,000
leaderboards and so forth. Game Center

5315
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:03,000
hasn't put that out of business because

5316
03:01:03,000 --> 03:01:05,000
Open Faint, I guess, offers

5317
03:01:05,000 --> 03:01:07,000
either it's easier to implement or it's a richer

5318
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:09,000
package. Multi-platform.

5319
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:11,000
Multi-platform as well and so forth.

5320
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:13,000
So, you know, who knows?

5321
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:15,000
Green Throttle could go multi-platform too, I would think.

5322
03:01:15,000 --> 03:01:17,000
Hypothetically, you know,

5323
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:19,000
with Android tablets or whatever. I don't think even if

5324
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:21,000
they did something like that where, you know,

5325
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:23,000
Apple TV or whatever had

5326
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:25,000
some sort of Bluetooth support, which

5327
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:27,000
I, honestly,

5328
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:29,000
I'm surprised that that device doesn't have

5329
03:01:29,000 --> 03:01:31,000
Bluetooth support, you know, the whole Apple TV.

5330
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:33,000
You know, what they could do,

5331
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:35,000
which would be interesting, is have

5332
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:37,000
if you have an Apple TV,

5333
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:39,000
because doesn't the Apple TV support

5334
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:41,000
like streaming, like you can content

5335
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:43,000
stream stuff from your iPod

5336
03:01:43,000 --> 03:01:45,000
or iPad to

5337
03:01:45,000 --> 03:01:47,000
the TV. Maybe say you

5338
03:01:47,000 --> 03:01:49,000
content stream something to

5339
03:01:49,000 --> 03:01:51,000
the TV and then you use a Bluetooth

5340
03:01:51,000 --> 03:01:53,000
controller with that and then you can

5341
03:01:53,000 --> 03:01:55,000
basically use the

5342
03:01:55,000 --> 03:01:57,000
iPad or

5343
03:01:57,000 --> 03:01:59,000
iPod or iPhone device

5344
03:01:59,000 --> 03:02:01,000
as like a tether, almost like, you know,

5345
03:02:01,000 --> 03:02:03,000
using the Wii

5346
03:02:03,000 --> 03:02:05,000
Classic Controller,

5347
03:02:05,000 --> 03:02:07,000
Classic Controller Pro with the Wii.

5348
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:09,000
You have to use the Wii Remote as kind of like

5349
03:02:09,000 --> 03:02:11,000
the Bluetooth tether to that.

5350
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:15,000
Alright, well, we're

5351
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:17,000
going to move on to the Skype line. 1877

5352
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:19,000
Game OLR or our username

5353
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:21,000
on Skype, OrangeLoungeRadio. It is open

5354
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:23,000
for business now. In the meantime,

5355
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:25,000
we'll get some last minute stories

5356
03:02:25,000 --> 03:02:27,000
and I want to do some Twitter topics

5357
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:29,000
as well. Things that were sent into

5358
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:31,000
twitter.com slash

5359
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:33,000
OLR. I want

5360
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:35,000
to do this one first. This is from

5361
03:02:35,000 --> 03:02:37,000
dammit, come on, load.

5362
03:02:37,000 --> 03:02:39,000
Here we go. This one's from

5363
03:02:39,000 --> 03:02:41,000
actdeft. Give a listen

5364
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:43,000
to the Wii U menu music.

5365
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:45,000
It's really good and entrancing.

5366
03:02:45,000 --> 03:02:47,000
I did not know that this was

5367
03:02:47,000 --> 03:02:49,000
out, but apparently here it is.

5368
03:02:49,000 --> 03:03:01,000
Here's the thing though.

5369
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:03,000
I want to go into skeptic mode here because

5370
03:03:03,000 --> 03:03:05,000
I noticed that the YouTube here

5371
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:07,000
has a link to a website where it says

5372
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:09,000
full album available and

5373
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:11,000
then it says check out more Wii U music

5374
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:13,000
and news at such and such website and

5375
03:03:13,000 --> 03:03:15,000
it's not an official Nintendo site either.

5376
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:17,000
Now I'm not saying maybe these guys didn't get a Wii U

5377
03:03:17,000 --> 03:03:19,000
but I'm always kind of curious

5378
03:03:19,000 --> 03:03:21,000
when it's this much blatant

5379
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:23,000
like go here, go to this site.

5380
03:03:23,000 --> 03:03:25,000
I don't know. I'm just saying.

5381
03:03:25,000 --> 03:03:27,000
I'm just saying.

5382
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:29,000
Could be legit.

5383
03:03:29,000 --> 03:03:31,000
What do you think?

5384
03:03:31,000 --> 03:03:33,000
Is this it? Is this the real deal?

5385
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:35,000
It sounds pretty Nintendo-y.

5386
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:37,000
It does sound a little pretty Nintendo-y. I believe it.

5387
03:03:37,000 --> 03:03:39,000
Yeah, I'm not sure.

5388
03:03:39,000 --> 03:03:41,000
We'll know within days

5389
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:43,000
because those things

5390
03:03:43,000 --> 03:03:45,000
are going to be out very, very,

5391
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:47,000
very soon.

5392
03:03:47,000 --> 03:03:49,000
Uh, let's go to phones.

5393
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:51,000
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

5394
03:03:51,000 --> 03:03:53,000
Hey, so we're Nate. How's it going?

5395
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:55,000
Hey, good. How are you, Nate?

5396
03:03:55,000 --> 03:03:57,000
Going good. Listen to all y'all

5397
03:03:57,000 --> 03:03:59,000
talks about vaporware and

5398
03:03:59,000 --> 03:04:01,000
green throttle and Wii U music.

5399
03:04:01,000 --> 03:04:03,000
Yeah.

5400
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:05,000
I just wanted to ask you all

5401
03:04:05,000 --> 03:04:07,000
who do you think is going to win the upcoming console war?

5402
03:04:07,000 --> 03:04:09,000
Who's going to win the upcoming console war?

5403
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:11,000
And to answer your question

5404
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:13,000
whether that was legit or not, yes, it is.

5405
03:04:13,000 --> 03:04:15,000
We actually have more menu music.

5406
03:04:15,000 --> 03:04:17,000
Because Kotaku, they were reviewing

5407
03:04:17,000 --> 03:04:19,000
they have their own Wii U thing

5408
03:04:19,000 --> 03:04:21,000
and they wouldn't post a story like that if it was completely

5409
03:04:21,000 --> 03:04:23,000
wrong, you know, because they have a Wii U

5410
03:04:23,000 --> 03:04:25,000
to compare that to.

5411
03:04:25,000 --> 03:04:27,000
Ah, I see. Okay, thank you for that clarification.

5412
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:29,000
I'm always a little skeptical when it's the internet.

5413
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:31,000
Alright, so Nate's

5414
03:04:31,000 --> 03:04:33,000
loaded question. No, I'm kidding.

5415
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:35,000
It's not a loaded question. It's a tough question.

5416
03:04:35,000 --> 03:04:37,000
Who's going to win the upcoming console war?

5417
03:04:37,000 --> 03:04:39,000
Nate, I think it's too damn early to tell.

5418
03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:41,000
And I think you only have one console.

5419
03:04:42,000 --> 03:04:44,000
Well, here's the thing

5420
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:46,000
because we don't know what

5421
03:04:46,000 --> 03:04:48,000
PlayStation 4 and what the new

5422
03:04:48,000 --> 03:04:50,000
Xbox have under their belt.

5423
03:04:50,000 --> 03:04:52,000
We're not

5424
03:04:52,000 --> 03:04:54,000
really going to know that until E3.

5425
03:04:58,000 --> 03:05:00,000
Right now we have to also

5426
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:02,000
evaluate, you know, how is the Wii U

5427
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:04,000
going to do? We're hearing

5428
03:05:04,000 --> 03:05:06,000
about sellouts and pre-order

5429
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:08,000
stuff and that they're hard to get

5430
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:10,000
but how much

5431
03:05:10,000 --> 03:05:12,000
of that is legitimately

5432
03:05:12,000 --> 03:05:14,000
everybody wants them in demand and how much of that

5433
03:05:14,000 --> 03:05:16,000
is Nintendo is slowly

5434
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:18,000
like a faucet

5435
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:20,000
drip letting these consoles out

5436
03:05:20,000 --> 03:05:22,000
to create that artificial

5437
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:24,000
demand. Well, I'm going to tell you

5438
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:26,000
right now who's going to win the whole console wars

5439
03:05:26,000 --> 03:05:28,000
here and it's going to come out of left field

5440
03:05:28,000 --> 03:05:30,000
here. It's the GE Micro Box

5441
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:32,000
microwave slash

5442
03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:34,000
console.

5443
03:05:34,000 --> 03:05:36,000
Because we're talking about the future and no one knows what the

5444
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:38,000
future is, that's what's going to win. Microwave console.

5445
03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:42,000
Okay, another question.

5446
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:44,000
Alright.

5447
03:05:44,000 --> 03:05:46,000
Okay, so I'll

5448
03:05:46,000 --> 03:05:48,000
hear you all talking about Green Throttle.

5449
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:50,000
If you

5450
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:52,000
have to pick between Green Throttle and

5451
03:05:52,000 --> 03:05:54,000
Ouya, who would you vote for?

5452
03:05:54,000 --> 03:05:56,000
Oh, damn.

5453
03:05:56,000 --> 03:05:58,000
That's a pretty good question because I don't really

5454
03:05:58,000 --> 03:06:00,000
know enough about Green Throttle

5455
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:02,000
yet.

5456
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:04,000
Based on presentation

5457
03:06:04,000 --> 03:06:06,000
and power and

5458
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:08,000
fame, glory, money.

5459
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:10,000
I'm going to have to go Ouya.

5460
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:12,000
Only reason because it's an actual console

5461
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:14,000
versus basically

5462
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:16,000
Green Throttle is just, okay, we have a controller

5463
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:18,000
that's paired with some games that we're making.

5464
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:20,000
But it doesn't have any hardware platform

5465
03:06:20,000 --> 03:06:22,000
that it's meant for. They don't have like their

5466
03:06:22,000 --> 03:06:24,000
own Android device or something.

5467
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:26,000
So you're going to get varied performance depending

5468
03:06:26,000 --> 03:06:28,000
on what kind of Android device that you have.

5469
03:06:28,000 --> 03:06:30,000
So that's the only problem there is it's

5470
03:06:30,000 --> 03:06:32,000
not a standardized platform. Whereas the

5471
03:06:32,000 --> 03:06:34,000
Ouya is actually going to be a

5472
03:06:34,000 --> 03:06:36,000
device that they make games for that they know will

5473
03:06:36,000 --> 03:06:38,000
run well on that platform.

5474
03:06:38,000 --> 03:06:40,000
I'm going to say the Ouya as well because

5475
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:42,000
again, I'm a little concerned about

5476
03:06:42,000 --> 03:06:44,000
Apple could really

5477
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:46,000
knock this Green Throttle thing down a

5478
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:48,000
few pegs by doing their own thing.

5479
03:06:48,000 --> 03:06:50,000
Whereas the Ouya is going to be a little tougher.

5480
03:06:50,000 --> 03:06:52,000
I think the Ouya is kind of trying to beat Apple

5481
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:54,000
at it's own game in a way.

5482
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:56,000
I think it's a little different. So I'm going to

5483
03:06:56,000 --> 03:06:58,000
go Ouya as well.

5484
03:06:58,000 --> 03:07:00,000
Okay, last question.

5485
03:07:00,000 --> 03:07:02,000
What

5486
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:04,000
game are you giving

5487
03:07:04,000 --> 03:07:06,000
the best game to come out

5488
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:08,000
between now

5489
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:10,000
and summer?

5490
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:12,000
Now and summer. So of all these games

5491
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:14,000
that got pushed back to 2013

5492
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:16,000
that make up the first and second

5493
03:07:16,000 --> 03:07:18,000
quarter releases, what's going to be the best game

5494
03:07:18,000 --> 03:07:20,000
to come out? I'm going to say Mass Effect Trilogy

5495
03:07:20,000 --> 03:07:22,000
on PS3.

5496
03:07:22,000 --> 03:07:24,000
No, no, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

5497
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:26,000
I am really

5498
03:07:26,000 --> 03:07:28,000
looking forward to the Tomb Raider

5499
03:07:28,000 --> 03:07:30,000
reboot. That's not coming out before

5500
03:07:30,000 --> 03:07:32,000
summer. Oh, get out.

5501
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:34,000
I thought it was pushed back to like March.

5502
03:07:36,000 --> 03:07:38,000
Yeah, yeah, go look that up in your

5503
03:07:38,000 --> 03:07:40,000
Funkin' Wagonals.

5504
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:42,000
I'm looking forward

5505
03:07:42,000 --> 03:07:44,000
to Omega. Omega

5506
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:46,000
DLC, Mass Effect. Are there any games?

5507
03:07:46,000 --> 03:07:48,000
Come on. Oh! Omega.

5508
03:07:48,000 --> 03:07:50,000
I don't know if it'll make summer, Nate,

5509
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:52,000
but the Final Fantasy XIV

5510
03:07:52,000 --> 03:07:54,000
Realm Reborn. No, that's fall next year.

5511
03:07:54,000 --> 03:07:56,000
I'm damn curious about that.

5512
03:07:56,000 --> 03:07:58,000
Okay, awesome.

5513
03:07:58,000 --> 03:08:00,000
Okay, I'll get off your Skype line.

5514
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:02,000
I think other people might want to call in.

5515
03:08:02,000 --> 03:08:04,000
That's alright, buddy. Clearly the

5516
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:06,000
correct answer is Grand Theft Auto V.

5517
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:08,000
I was going to say, I'm not even going to ask Loki

5518
03:08:08,000 --> 03:08:10,000
because I know the answer is Grand Theft Auto V.

5519
03:08:10,000 --> 03:08:12,000
So there you go, a wide variety of answers.

5520
03:08:12,000 --> 03:08:14,000
With a close second being Bioshock Infinite.

5521
03:08:14,000 --> 03:08:16,000
Oh, yeah, that's going to be a win, too.

5522
03:08:16,000 --> 03:08:18,000
Well, Nate, I'm going to turn the tables on you.

5523
03:08:18,000 --> 03:08:20,000
I got a question for you.

5524
03:08:20,000 --> 03:08:22,000
Um, I don't, I don't give questions.

5525
03:08:22,000 --> 03:08:24,000
But, yes.

5526
03:08:24,000 --> 03:08:26,000
Ask away.

5527
03:08:26,000 --> 03:08:28,000
Alright, you've asked us about

5528
03:08:28,000 --> 03:08:30,000
console wars and what we're looking

5529
03:08:30,000 --> 03:08:32,000
forward to and all this stuff.

5530
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:34,000
What do you want to see happen in gaming

5531
03:08:34,000 --> 03:08:36,000
in 2013?

5532
03:08:36,000 --> 03:08:38,000
Okay, so,

5533
03:08:38,000 --> 03:08:40,000
um, I'm just going to be a little

5534
03:08:40,000 --> 03:08:42,000
vague because there's other things I could talk

5535
03:08:42,000 --> 03:08:44,000
about but I want to talk about now.

5536
03:08:44,000 --> 03:08:46,000
Um, I would like to see,

5537
03:08:46,000 --> 03:08:48,000
um, the rise

5538
03:08:48,000 --> 03:08:50,000
of indie gaming and also, um,

5539
03:08:50,000 --> 03:08:52,000
like, far less

5540
03:08:52,000 --> 03:08:54,000
social games and all these, like, small,

5541
03:08:54,000 --> 03:08:56,000
like, touchscreen games.

5542
03:08:56,000 --> 03:08:58,000
I would like to see less of in 2013.

5543
03:08:58,000 --> 03:09:00,000
Alright, so you want to see

5544
03:09:00,000 --> 03:09:02,000
indie games come up, but you want to see social

5545
03:09:02,000 --> 03:09:04,000
games go away. I got to tell you, though, buddy,

5546
03:09:04,000 --> 03:09:06,000
that's where a lot of indies get their start

5547
03:09:06,000 --> 03:09:08,000
right now is on iPhone and all that stuff.

5548
03:09:08,000 --> 03:09:10,000
Are you okay with the mobile games?

5549
03:09:10,000 --> 03:09:12,000
Um, I don't have a

5550
03:09:12,000 --> 03:09:14,000
smartphone, so that's, that's like

5551
03:09:14,000 --> 03:09:16,000
a no. So, so

5552
03:09:16,000 --> 03:09:18,000
screw everybody else.

5553
03:09:18,000 --> 03:09:20,000
Um, I'm a consoleer, PCer,

5554
03:09:20,000 --> 03:09:22,000
um,

5555
03:09:22,000 --> 03:09:24,000
I try to play Angry Birds, but that's

5556
03:09:24,000 --> 03:09:26,000
PC. That's, you know what, there's

5557
03:09:26,000 --> 03:09:28,000
indie, of course, has a huge

5558
03:09:28,000 --> 03:09:30,000
life on PC and lots of great indie stuff

5559
03:09:30,000 --> 03:09:32,000
gets their start on PC, so, and

5560
03:09:32,000 --> 03:09:34,000
I'm with you. I'd like to see some more

5561
03:09:34,000 --> 03:09:36,000
indie games make it big. You know, uh,

5562
03:09:36,000 --> 03:09:38,000
the best games to come, we probably

5563
03:09:38,000 --> 03:09:40,000
don't even know about yet. Think about that.

5564
03:09:40,000 --> 03:09:42,000
Alright, Nate, thank you

5565
03:09:42,000 --> 03:09:44,000
for the questions. We appreciate it. Have a

5566
03:09:44,000 --> 03:09:46,000
good one, buddy, okay? Alright, talk to you later.

5567
03:09:46,000 --> 03:09:48,000
Alright, you too. Bye.

5568
03:09:48,000 --> 03:09:50,000
See, I like that. I like the whole

5569
03:09:50,000 --> 03:09:52,000
you're gonna ask me questions? Oh, yeah, buddy,

5570
03:09:52,000 --> 03:09:54,000
I got a question for you.

5571
03:09:54,000 --> 03:09:56,000
Our job sucks,

5572
03:09:56,000 --> 03:09:58,000
huh? No, I'm kidding. No, I loved it.

5573
03:09:58,000 --> 03:10:00,000
I love getting questions. 1877

5574
03:10:00,000 --> 03:10:02,000
Game OLR, or our username on

5575
03:10:02,000 --> 03:10:04,000
Skype. Orange Lounge Radio!

5576
03:10:04,000 --> 03:10:06,000
Let's go to the phones.

5577
03:10:08,000 --> 03:10:10,000
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio. Who's this?

5578
03:10:10,000 --> 03:10:12,000
Legend Zaku here. Zaku, you must have

5579
03:10:12,000 --> 03:10:14,000
loved that interview tonight.

5580
03:10:14,000 --> 03:10:16,000
Huh? Did you, did you hear our interview

5581
03:10:16,000 --> 03:10:18,000
with Eddie tonight?

5582
03:10:18,000 --> 03:10:20,000
Um, yeah, yeah, definitely. I, I

5583
03:10:20,000 --> 03:10:22,000
just caught, like, the, I guess, the tail end

5584
03:10:22,000 --> 03:10:24,000
of it. Oh. After, like, watching

5585
03:10:24,000 --> 03:10:26,000
Walking Dead. For, oh, oh, oh,

5586
03:10:26,000 --> 03:10:28,000
we got, we got shafted for walking.

5587
03:10:28,000 --> 03:10:30,000
I, I, I hear it through the show. I'm sorry, but

5588
03:10:30,000 --> 03:10:32,000
that's kind of, like, religion here.

5589
03:10:32,000 --> 03:10:34,000
We don't, we don't have blood and guts and

5590
03:10:34,000 --> 03:10:36,000
zombies yet. I had a stein full of, like, beer ready to go

5591
03:10:36,000 --> 03:10:38,000
and my snacks. But, yeah,

5592
03:10:38,000 --> 03:10:40,000
um, I guess

5593
03:10:40,000 --> 03:10:42,000
this is probably gonna be out of the ordinary, but

5594
03:10:42,000 --> 03:10:44,000
I've had this, uh,

5595
03:10:44,000 --> 03:10:46,000
this thing that, had, like,

5596
03:10:46,000 --> 03:10:48,000
my Steam collection that I've been wanting to,

5597
03:10:48,000 --> 03:10:50,000
like, wrangle down because I've, like,

5598
03:10:50,000 --> 03:10:52,000
gotten so many games that I have a

5599
03:10:52,000 --> 03:10:54,000
backlog. It's created,

5600
03:10:54,000 --> 03:10:56,000
created such a backlog that I'm not sure

5601
03:10:56,000 --> 03:10:58,000
how to actually systematically

5602
03:10:58,000 --> 03:11:00,000
approach having to tackle

5603
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:02,000
all these games that I have. I'm gonna post it right

5604
03:11:02,000 --> 03:11:04,000
now in the chat room.

5605
03:11:04,000 --> 03:11:06,000
And I'm just, like,

5606
03:11:06,000 --> 03:11:08,000
like, I have some of them already. I'm putting

5607
03:11:08,000 --> 03:11:10,000
time on them, but there's still,

5608
03:11:10,000 --> 03:11:12,000
there's still plenty, like, that I just bought

5609
03:11:12,000 --> 03:11:14,000
because they were cheap at that point and I just got them

5610
03:11:14,000 --> 03:11:16,000
for the sake of getting them. But now

5611
03:11:16,000 --> 03:11:18,000
it's, like, I don't know,

5612
03:11:18,000 --> 03:11:20,000
like, I'm, like, preventing myself from getting games

5613
03:11:20,000 --> 03:11:22,000
because of, because it's gonna add,

5614
03:11:22,000 --> 03:11:24,000
it's gonna add more fuel to the fire.

5615
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:26,000
Well, you're doing the right thing by investing

5616
03:11:26,000 --> 03:11:28,000
99 hours in Skyrim.

5617
03:11:28,000 --> 03:11:30,000
52 hours Team 76, Battlefield

5618
03:11:30,000 --> 03:11:32,000
Bad Company. Alright, you got your priorities

5619
03:11:32,000 --> 03:11:34,000
right. I'm just trying to see if there's a game

5620
03:11:34,000 --> 03:11:36,000
you're not playing enough.

5621
03:11:36,000 --> 03:11:38,000
Okay, Torchlight? What's up with this?

5622
03:11:38,000 --> 03:11:40,000
Less than an hour on Torchlight. You gotta fix that, buddy.

5623
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:42,000
Um, I have put in more time,

5624
03:11:42,000 --> 03:11:44,000
but that was on my Mac.

5625
03:11:44,000 --> 03:11:46,000
And that was, that was when I was heading

5626
03:11:46,000 --> 03:11:48,000
down, you know,

5627
03:11:48,000 --> 03:11:50,000
when I was heading down to Otacon on the train and I

5628
03:11:50,000 --> 03:11:52,000
didn't even have, like, a connection, so I was playing offline.

5629
03:11:52,000 --> 03:11:54,000
So that count,

5630
03:11:54,000 --> 03:11:56,000
that time didn't get counted for yet.

5631
03:11:56,000 --> 03:11:58,000
Uh, you would make Allen

5632
03:11:58,000 --> 03:12:00,000
a very sad puppy with all these Half-Life

5633
03:12:00,000 --> 03:12:02,000
games you own that you haven't even played yet.

5634
03:12:02,000 --> 03:12:04,000
I know, I know, I'm guilty

5635
03:12:04,000 --> 03:12:06,000
of that. Alright. And I'm also in

5636
03:12:06,000 --> 03:12:08,000
between, like, Battlefield 3

5637
03:12:08,000 --> 03:12:10,000
and Hawks, which is, like, crapping out on me,

5638
03:12:10,000 --> 03:12:12,000
so I had to switch up to other games. And, uh,

5639
03:12:12,000 --> 03:12:14,000
Loki, look at this.

5640
03:12:14,000 --> 03:12:16,000
Loki, look, look, look what he's got here,

5641
03:12:16,000 --> 03:12:18,000
sitting in his collection untouched. Right there,

5642
03:12:18,000 --> 03:12:20,000
you see that? Grand Theft Auto 4

5643
03:12:20,000 --> 03:12:22,000
and episodes from Liberty City. What do you have to

5644
03:12:22,000 --> 03:12:24,000
say about that? Probably got him really cheap.

5645
03:12:24,000 --> 03:12:26,000
Yes.

5646
03:12:26,000 --> 03:12:28,000
You can do that.

5647
03:12:28,000 --> 03:12:30,000
You know what, if I were to show you my Steam

5648
03:12:30,000 --> 03:12:32,000
collection and you were to rate me on that same scale,

5649
03:12:32,000 --> 03:12:34,000
you would be like, Rob, I'm taking that

5650
03:12:34,000 --> 03:12:36,000
podcast away from you, so you have time to go play these games.

5651
03:12:36,000 --> 03:12:38,000
Dude, I've got so many indie games that I've

5652
03:12:38,000 --> 03:12:40,000
bought from all these Humble bundles that I have

5653
03:12:40,000 --> 03:12:42,000
never played. We're sitting here hazing

5654
03:12:42,000 --> 03:12:44,000
you on all the stuff you haven't played, but we are

5655
03:12:44,000 --> 03:12:46,000
the worst when it comes to this

5656
03:12:46,000 --> 03:12:48,000
stuff. So, you know what, buddy?

5657
03:12:48,000 --> 03:12:50,000
It's all good. At least you're, uh,

5658
03:12:50,000 --> 03:12:52,000
supporting these developers.

5659
03:12:52,000 --> 03:12:54,000
Alright, one more

5660
03:12:54,000 --> 03:12:56,000
thing. Seeing that Black Friday

5661
03:12:56,000 --> 03:12:58,000
and the holiday shopping season is upon us,

5662
03:12:58,000 --> 03:13:00,000
I'm kind of at a crossroads

5663
03:13:00,000 --> 03:13:02,000
where, like, I don't know what

5664
03:13:02,000 --> 03:13:04,000
else to invest on my 360 that

5665
03:13:04,000 --> 03:13:06,000
isn't already out on PC and isn't already

5666
03:13:06,000 --> 03:13:08,000
on another platform. Like,

5667
03:13:08,000 --> 03:13:10,000
every time I go to GameStop or any video

5668
03:13:10,000 --> 03:13:12,000
game store, I'm always hard, I'm always

5669
03:13:12,000 --> 03:13:14,000
pressed as to trying to find something

5670
03:13:14,000 --> 03:13:16,000
that, A, obviously isn't

5671
03:13:16,000 --> 03:13:18,000
PC or on a PS3, and

5672
03:13:18,000 --> 03:13:20,000
B, isn't, like, a first-person shooter.

5673
03:13:20,000 --> 03:13:22,000
So it's kind of like finding those,

5674
03:13:22,000 --> 03:13:24,000
like, that small scope of

5675
03:13:24,000 --> 03:13:26,000
console exclusives

5676
03:13:26,000 --> 03:13:28,000
that I can't really play that I wouldn't

5677
03:13:28,000 --> 03:13:30,000
normally otherwise play on another platform.

5678
03:13:30,000 --> 03:13:32,000
Honestly, Zaku,

5679
03:13:32,000 --> 03:13:34,000
if Xbox Live isn't doing it for you

5680
03:13:34,000 --> 03:13:36,000
and the community on there, and, um,

5681
03:13:36,000 --> 03:13:38,000
you know, the indie games and some of the stuff that

5682
03:13:38,000 --> 03:13:40,000
you can download on Xbox, uh,

5683
03:13:40,000 --> 03:13:42,000
and all that, maybe you should

5684
03:13:42,000 --> 03:13:44,000
think about offloading your Xbox, because

5685
03:13:44,000 --> 03:13:46,000
yeah, when it comes to exclusives, you know,

5686
03:13:46,000 --> 03:13:48,000
Microsoft's got, you know,

5687
03:13:48,000 --> 03:13:50,000
again, there's Kinect. A PS3 is

5688
03:13:50,000 --> 03:13:52,000
definitely, yeah, I know, I

5689
03:13:52,000 --> 03:13:54,000
understand that, you know, I'm kind of

5690
03:13:54,000 --> 03:13:56,000
contemplating it, but on the

5691
03:13:56,000 --> 03:13:58,000
other hand, I am

5692
03:13:58,000 --> 03:14:00,000
long overdue for a PS3. Let's

5693
03:14:00,000 --> 03:14:02,000
just say that my girlfriend was hinting at

5694
03:14:02,000 --> 03:14:04,000
trying to avoid, you know, telling me to avoid

5695
03:14:04,000 --> 03:14:06,000
getting one in the next couple of

5696
03:14:06,000 --> 03:14:08,000
weeks, so I pretty much, I can

5697
03:14:08,000 --> 03:14:10,000
pretty much say with certainty that she's

5698
03:14:10,000 --> 03:14:12,000
probably hinting towards getting me,

5699
03:14:12,000 --> 03:14:14,000
you know, something like that.

5700
03:14:14,000 --> 03:14:16,000
What a nice girl. So, I might be able to

5701
03:14:16,000 --> 03:14:18,000
exploit that

5702
03:14:18,000 --> 03:14:20,000
avenue in terms of playing the

5703
03:14:20,000 --> 03:14:22,000
PS3 exclusives that I missed

5704
03:14:22,000 --> 03:14:24,000
out on, like Gran Turismo 5,

5705
03:14:24,000 --> 03:14:26,000
the Uncharted series, uh, Metal Gear Solid

5706
03:14:26,000 --> 03:14:28,000
4. No, Gran Turismo 5 never came out.

5707
03:14:28,000 --> 03:14:30,000
Did?

5708
03:14:30,000 --> 03:14:32,000
It's a running joke.

5709
03:14:32,000 --> 03:14:34,000
That's not what Bobby said.

5710
03:14:34,000 --> 03:14:36,000
That's not what Bobby said.

5711
03:14:36,000 --> 03:14:38,000
It did, but it's like,

5712
03:14:38,000 --> 03:14:40,000
yeah, it's kind of like that

5713
03:14:40,000 --> 03:14:42,000
red-headed stepchild, but I mean,

5714
03:14:42,000 --> 03:14:44,000
with GT5, I could plug in, like,

5715
03:14:44,000 --> 03:14:46,000
a high-end racing wheel.

5716
03:14:46,000 --> 03:14:48,000
I wouldn't be able to do a Forza,

5717
03:14:48,000 --> 03:14:50,000
for example, since it's like,

5718
03:14:50,000 --> 03:14:52,000
I'm not going to play with some virtual,

5719
03:14:52,000 --> 03:14:54,000
like, wireless wheel that I have to

5720
03:14:54,000 --> 03:14:56,000
pretend like doing air steering,

5721
03:14:56,000 --> 03:14:58,000
which I have, which is garbage.

5722
03:14:58,000 --> 03:15:00,000
You don't have to do air steering with Forza, though.

5723
03:15:00,000 --> 03:15:02,000
Forza, I, you know, I,

5724
03:15:02,000 --> 03:15:04,000
Bobby was very kind to Forza, and he wrote

5725
03:15:04,000 --> 03:15:06,000
the review on vognetwork.com, and

5726
03:15:06,000 --> 03:15:08,000
I know Actif's a big fan of it as well. I

5727
03:15:08,000 --> 03:15:10,000
played the demo. I liked it, but

5728
03:15:10,000 --> 03:15:12,000
I just spent $120 on

5729
03:15:12,000 --> 03:15:14,000
games this week, so I won't be picking up Forza

5730
03:15:14,000 --> 03:15:16,000
anytime soon, but I'm interested in it. Forza's

5731
03:15:16,000 --> 03:15:18,000
pretty good for what it's worth on

5732
03:15:18,000 --> 03:15:20,000
the 360, but in terms of actually,

5733
03:15:20,000 --> 03:15:22,000
like, for a hardcore game, you know, for

5734
03:15:22,000 --> 03:15:24,000
a hardcore racing gamer

5735
03:15:24,000 --> 03:15:26,000
who wants to, like, plug in their Logitech

5736
03:15:26,000 --> 03:15:28,000
G27 in there, which is not

5737
03:15:28,000 --> 03:15:30,000
even possible because it only supports PC

5738
03:15:30,000 --> 03:15:32,000
and PS3, I'm only,

5739
03:15:32,000 --> 03:15:34,000
you know, I'm basically, like,

5740
03:15:34,000 --> 03:15:36,000
forced to buy their,

5741
03:15:36,000 --> 03:15:38,000
like, you know, their bullshit

5742
03:15:38,000 --> 03:15:40,000
wireless wheel that

5743
03:15:40,000 --> 03:15:42,000
is just like, it's just like a yoke

5744
03:15:42,000 --> 03:15:44,000
shaped thing that just,

5745
03:15:44,000 --> 03:15:46,000
you could just, like, hold it up and just

5746
03:15:46,000 --> 03:15:48,000
stare, and it basically does it for you,

5747
03:15:48,000 --> 03:15:50,000
but it's not cutting it, because it's

5748
03:15:50,000 --> 03:15:52,000
like, I want to have that feel

5749
03:15:52,000 --> 03:15:54,000
and the shock of actually, um,

5750
03:15:54,000 --> 03:15:56,000
driving a car, shifting the

5751
03:15:56,000 --> 03:15:58,000
gears, and so

5752
03:15:58,000 --> 03:16:00,000
forth. Then go out and drive a car.

5753
03:16:00,000 --> 03:16:02,000
Well, drive a car

5754
03:16:02,000 --> 03:16:04,000
at high speeds without getting pulled over,

5755
03:16:04,000 --> 03:16:06,000
sure, sure.

5756
03:16:06,000 --> 03:16:08,000
Sure, buddy. It's worth a shot.

5757
03:16:08,000 --> 03:16:10,000
Go to Montana, ain't no one care out there.

5758
03:16:10,000 --> 03:16:12,000
Alright, Saku, I gotta let you go so we

5759
03:16:12,000 --> 03:16:14,000
can wrap up the show, maybe get one more call, alright?

5760
03:16:14,000 --> 03:16:16,000
Alright. Take care. Have a good one.

5761
03:16:16,000 --> 03:16:18,000
Bye, you too.

5762
03:16:18,000 --> 03:16:20,000
Alright, 1877 Game OLR, our

5763
03:16:20,000 --> 03:16:22,000
username on Skype is OrangeLaunchRadio. I

5764
03:16:22,000 --> 03:16:24,000
suppose we have time for one more

5765
03:16:24,000 --> 03:16:26,000
call, but I want to do some more of these tweets

5766
03:16:26,000 --> 03:16:28,000
here real quick, and then I'll let

5767
03:16:28,000 --> 03:16:30,000
Loki do last minute stories. Uh, TigerClaw

5768
03:16:30,000 --> 03:16:32,000
is sending us a couple tweets. I remember

5769
03:16:32,000 --> 03:16:34,000
reading about this one, and for some reason, they

5770
03:16:34,000 --> 03:16:36,000
make our show roll, but getting it out there,

5771
03:16:36,000 --> 03:16:38,000
what, uh, TigerClaw linked us to on

5772
03:16:38,000 --> 03:16:40,000
GamePolitics.com. Capcom

5773
03:16:40,000 --> 03:16:42,000
can no longer make new Tatsunoko

5774
03:16:42,000 --> 03:16:44,000
games. If you do not own

5775
03:16:44,000 --> 03:16:46,000
the Tatsunoko versus Capcom game,

5776
03:16:46,000 --> 03:16:48,000
uh, you better hurry up and find

5777
03:16:48,000 --> 03:16:50,000
it in a bargain bin somewhere, because Capcom

5778
03:16:50,000 --> 03:16:52,000
no longer holds the rights

5779
03:16:52,000 --> 03:16:54,000
to publish Tatsunoko games.

5780
03:16:54,000 --> 03:16:56,000
That was a limited deal, so,

5781
03:16:56,000 --> 03:16:58,000
uh, if you're hoping-

5782
03:16:58,000 --> 03:17:00,000
I have mine.

5783
03:17:00,000 --> 03:17:02,000
If you're hoping for a part two,

5784
03:17:02,000 --> 03:17:04,000
keep right on hoping.

5785
03:17:04,000 --> 03:17:06,000
This is really interesting. TigerClaw

5786
03:17:06,000 --> 03:17:08,000
linked into another story on, uh,

5787
03:17:08,000 --> 03:17:10,000
uh, Twitter.

5788
03:17:10,000 --> 03:17:12,000
I almost said Skype.

5789
03:17:12,000 --> 03:17:14,000
He didn't link on Skype, he linked on Twitter.

5790
03:17:14,000 --> 03:17:16,000
Foxconn rumored to be planning

5791
03:17:16,000 --> 03:17:18,000
US plants?

5792
03:17:18,000 --> 03:17:20,000
Isn't Foxconn that company in China

5793
03:17:20,000 --> 03:17:22,000
that all those controversial stories-

5794
03:17:22,000 --> 03:17:24,000
Is this a Goodwill thing, or, or

5795
03:17:24,000 --> 03:17:26,000
what is this? But, yeah.

5796
03:17:26,000 --> 03:17:28,000
Apparently, uh, they are evaluating Detroit

5797
03:17:28,000 --> 03:17:30,000
and LA for new operations.

5798
03:17:30,000 --> 03:17:32,000
Um, this is, uh-

5799
03:17:32,000 --> 03:17:34,000
Is there outsourcing here? Are we cheaper

5800
03:17:34,000 --> 03:17:36,000
labor? I- Hold on, I'll get back

5801
03:17:36,000 --> 03:17:38,000
to the story in a minute, but we got one more,

5802
03:17:38,000 --> 03:17:40,000
one more call coming in. I'll take this call, and then we'll go back to the story.

5803
03:17:40,000 --> 03:17:42,000
Hi, you're on Orange Honest Radio. Who's this?

5804
03:17:42,000 --> 03:17:44,000
Hey, this is Act Deft.

5805
03:17:44,000 --> 03:17:46,000
Act Deft? What's on your mind, buddy?

5806
03:17:46,000 --> 03:17:48,000
Well, I want to talk about

5807
03:17:48,000 --> 03:17:50,000
Forza Horizon 2.

5808
03:17:50,000 --> 03:17:52,000
Something that Zaku said.

5809
03:17:52,000 --> 03:17:54,000
Uh-oh. Alright, what'd you want to say in response

5810
03:17:54,000 --> 03:17:56,000
to what Zaku said?

5811
03:17:56,000 --> 03:17:58,000
Uh, he says, uh, Forza

5812
03:17:58,000 --> 03:18:00,000
isn't, or, Forza Horizon

5813
03:18:00,000 --> 03:18:02,000
isn't made for, uh,

5814
03:18:02,000 --> 03:18:04,000
well, playing with, playing

5815
03:18:04,000 --> 03:18:06,000
it with a, with a real controller,

5816
03:18:06,000 --> 03:18:08,000
er, racing controller. Mm-hmm.

5817
03:18:08,000 --> 03:18:10,000
And he's pretty wrong on that.

5818
03:18:10,000 --> 03:18:12,000
He's wrong? You're calling him out?

5819
03:18:12,000 --> 03:18:14,000
Why is he wrong?

5820
03:18:14,000 --> 03:18:16,000
Well, basically, uh, one of the, one of my

5821
03:18:16,000 --> 03:18:18,000
friends I play, uh, Forza,

5822
03:18:18,000 --> 03:18:20,000
uh, frequently with,

5823
03:18:20,000 --> 03:18:22,000
he has a fantastic controller,

5824
03:18:22,000 --> 03:18:24,000
and those controllers are, like, really

5825
03:18:24,000 --> 03:18:26,000
expensive, uh,

5826
03:18:26,000 --> 03:18:28,000
they have a lot of, uh, stuff

5827
03:18:28,000 --> 03:18:30,000
that, that makes it, makes

5828
03:18:30,000 --> 03:18:32,000
it feel like a li-, uh, you're driving

5829
03:18:32,000 --> 03:18:34,000
a real car, so,

5830
03:18:34,000 --> 03:18:36,000
uh, basically, you can,

5831
03:18:36,000 --> 03:18:38,000
uh, play, uh, play,

5832
03:18:38,000 --> 03:18:40,000
sorry, or, uh,

5833
03:18:40,000 --> 03:18:42,000
play with a real controller,

5834
03:18:42,000 --> 03:18:44,000
a good controller, uh, even though

5835
03:18:44,000 --> 03:18:46,000
it, it does feel different,

5836
03:18:46,000 --> 03:18:48,000
from, uh, even from Forza

5837
03:18:48,000 --> 03:18:50,000
4, but

5838
03:18:50,000 --> 03:18:52,000
you can still play it.

5839
03:18:52,000 --> 03:18:54,000
Now, Zaku in chat is, is clarifying,

5840
03:18:54,000 --> 03:18:56,000
I didn't bash Forza Horizon,

5841
03:18:56,000 --> 03:18:58,000
Forza 4 sucked ass on the 360

5842
03:18:58,000 --> 03:19:00,000
wireless steering wheel. Well, that's...

5843
03:19:02,000 --> 03:19:04,000
Well, that's different. I, I, I don't know

5844
03:19:04,000 --> 03:19:06,000
about the, the 360 controller,

5845
03:19:06,000 --> 03:19:08,000
but you can play. Yeah, Forza Horizon,

5846
03:19:08,000 --> 03:19:10,000
the demo played alright to me. I liked

5847
03:19:10,000 --> 03:19:12,000
that it, it was really stupid

5848
03:19:12,000 --> 03:19:14,000
proof, like, the demo was really stupid

5849
03:19:14,000 --> 03:19:16,000
proof, like, I played on Easy, and it was like,

5850
03:19:16,000 --> 03:19:18,000
here, let me break the car

5851
03:19:18,000 --> 03:19:20,000
for you. It's like having a driving instructor

5852
03:19:20,000 --> 03:19:22,000
sitting right next to you. I'm like, oh,

5853
03:19:22,000 --> 03:19:24,000
this is what I needed to be able to play Forza,

5854
03:19:24,000 --> 03:19:26,000
this is great. I'm totally,

5855
03:19:26,000 --> 03:19:28,000
I am being totally honest.

5856
03:19:28,000 --> 03:19:30,000
Well, uh, I have played,

5857
03:19:30,000 --> 03:19:32,000
uh, since Forza 2, and I,

5858
03:19:32,000 --> 03:19:34,000
and I loved it because

5859
03:19:34,000 --> 03:19:36,000
it's so easy to pretty much pick

5860
03:19:36,000 --> 03:19:38,000
up and play, even though, uh,

5861
03:19:38,000 --> 03:19:40,000
it does, uh, get harder on

5862
03:19:40,000 --> 03:19:42,000
later races for the

5863
03:19:42,000 --> 03:19:44,000
difficulty. Sure. It's pretty much

5864
03:19:44,000 --> 03:19:46,000
easy to play because you have

5865
03:19:46,000 --> 03:19:48,000
so much things, uh, that help

5866
03:19:48,000 --> 03:19:50,000
the, the driver, the

5867
03:19:50,000 --> 03:19:52,000
player, that

5868
03:19:52,000 --> 03:19:54,000
you can much, uh, pretty,

5869
03:19:54,000 --> 03:19:56,000
uh, pretty much screw up a race and

5870
03:19:56,000 --> 03:19:58,000
even though, uh,

5871
03:19:58,000 --> 03:20:00,000
the game will help you to correct

5872
03:20:00,000 --> 03:20:02,000
that and be a better player.

5873
03:20:02,000 --> 03:20:04,000
So, you, you give,

5874
03:20:04,000 --> 03:20:06,000
uh, Forza Horizon your stamp of approval

5875
03:20:06,000 --> 03:20:08,000
as well. I know I saw Bobby gave it a good review on

5876
03:20:08,000 --> 03:20:10,000
the site. Did you give it a good review too?

5877
03:20:10,000 --> 03:20:12,000
Yeah, I pretty much

5878
03:20:12,000 --> 03:20:14,000
gave, uh, the same points as

5879
03:20:14,000 --> 03:20:16,000
Bobby, even though, uh,

5880
03:20:16,000 --> 03:20:18,000
the difficulty in Forza Horizon can be

5881
03:20:18,000 --> 03:20:20,000
pretty unforgiving,

5882
03:20:20,000 --> 03:20:22,000
but it's still a great game.

5883
03:20:22,000 --> 03:20:24,000
Uh, even single player or

5884
03:20:24,000 --> 03:20:26,000
multiplayer, it's really good.

5885
03:20:26,000 --> 03:20:28,000
Alright. And, uh, it looks like they

5886
03:20:28,000 --> 03:20:30,000
just want to clarify one more thing. Not bashing the

5887
03:20:30,000 --> 03:20:32,000
game, says Black Wolf. He's bashing Microsoft's

5888
03:20:32,000 --> 03:20:34,000
controller standards.

5889
03:20:34,000 --> 03:20:36,000
No, I know. I know, but

5890
03:20:36,000 --> 03:20:38,000
like I said, if you have a good controller,

5891
03:20:38,000 --> 03:20:40,000
it will work. Yeah, 360 does have some,

5892
03:20:40,000 --> 03:20:42,000
some, uh, that controller does leave some things

5893
03:20:42,000 --> 03:20:44,000
to be desired, especially when it comes to that D-pad.

5894
03:20:44,000 --> 03:20:46,000
Alright, act deft. I'm going to let you go

5895
03:20:46,000 --> 03:20:48,000
so we can wrap up the show, but thanks so much, buddy. Okay?

5896
03:20:48,000 --> 03:20:50,000
Thank you. Alright, take care.

5897
03:20:50,000 --> 03:20:52,000
Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line tonight.

5898
03:20:52,000 --> 03:20:54,000
I'm going to close it up because we are running a little

5899
03:20:54,000 --> 03:20:56,000
long. I want to finish up Twitter and

5900
03:20:56,000 --> 03:20:58,000
then I'll let, uh, uh, Loki do any last

5901
03:20:58,000 --> 03:21:00,000
minute stories or Jamie. Um,

5902
03:21:00,000 --> 03:21:02,000
uh, that Foxconn story, let's see,

5903
03:21:02,000 --> 03:21:04,000
it's a Digitimes report saying that

5904
03:21:04,000 --> 03:21:06,000
Foxconn Electronics plans to set up

5905
03:21:06,000 --> 03:21:08,000
manufacturing plants in the US, looking

5906
03:21:08,000 --> 03:21:10,000
at Detroit and Los Angeles.

5907
03:21:10,000 --> 03:21:12,000
Uh, market watchers are the source of

5908
03:21:12,000 --> 03:21:14,000
the news. Uh, these facilities

5909
03:21:14,000 --> 03:21:16,000
would be expected to handle LCD

5910
03:21:16,000 --> 03:21:18,000
TV manufacturing. It's a

5911
03:21:18,000 --> 03:21:20,000
simpler and more automated process.

5912
03:21:20,000 --> 03:21:22,000
So, um,

5913
03:21:22,000 --> 03:21:24,000
It requires a lot less suicide.

5914
03:21:24,000 --> 03:21:26,000
Stop it.

5915
03:21:26,000 --> 03:21:28,000
Take that with a gigantic grain of

5916
03:21:28,000 --> 03:21:30,000
salt, but there you go.

5917
03:21:30,000 --> 03:21:32,000
Um, one other tweet I want to read

5918
03:21:32,000 --> 03:21:34,000
here is from Spazinator PSN on

5919
03:21:34,000 --> 03:21:36,000
Twitter. Sky, I'm challenging

5920
03:21:36,000 --> 03:21:38,000
to top some of my high

5921
03:21:38,000 --> 03:21:40,000
scores in Game Room.

5922
03:21:40,000 --> 03:21:42,000
Yes, I said Game Room.

5923
03:21:42,000 --> 03:21:44,000
What? What's that? We're going to party like it's 2010.

5924
03:21:44,000 --> 03:21:46,000
Woo! What's a Game Room?

5925
03:21:46,000 --> 03:21:48,000
He's talking about Microsoft Game Room.

5926
03:21:48,000 --> 03:21:50,000
You know, I haven't touched Game Room in a while

5927
03:21:50,000 --> 03:21:52,000
and I should. I'm

5928
03:21:52,000 --> 03:21:54,000
going to go back and, and

5929
03:21:54,000 --> 03:21:56,000
I'll go back and, you know, I did spend money

5930
03:21:56,000 --> 03:21:58,000
on a lot of those games and a lot more

5931
03:21:58,000 --> 03:22:00,000
than I really should be admitting. So I do

5932
03:22:00,000 --> 03:22:02,000
need to go back and show Spazinator

5933
03:22:02,000 --> 03:22:04,000
how it's done. So, uh,

5934
03:22:04,000 --> 03:22:06,000
fine. Challenge accepted.

5935
03:22:06,000 --> 03:22:08,000
Probably be able to set some high scores because

5936
03:22:08,000 --> 03:22:10,000
no one plays it anymore. Challenge accepted!

5937
03:22:10,000 --> 03:22:12,000
Loki, any last

5938
03:22:12,000 --> 03:22:14,000
minute stories? Uh, just a couple.

5939
03:22:14,000 --> 03:22:16,000
There was a comment about

5940
03:22:16,000 --> 03:22:18,000
Minecraft. They

5941
03:22:18,000 --> 03:22:20,000
were, um, basically saying that

5942
03:22:20,000 --> 03:22:22,000
the future of Minecraft is

5943
03:22:22,000 --> 03:22:24,000
the consumer. And the reason that is

5944
03:22:24,000 --> 03:22:26,000
is because one of the things that they're working on is

5945
03:22:26,000 --> 03:22:28,000
the whole new mod

5946
03:22:28,000 --> 03:22:30,000
interface that

5947
03:22:30,000 --> 03:22:32,000
they're going to allow people to be able to

5948
03:22:32,000 --> 03:22:34,000
mod Minecraft a lot easier.

5949
03:22:34,000 --> 03:22:36,000
Because right now it's a little bit difficult. You kind

5950
03:22:36,000 --> 03:22:38,000
of have to replace files in the jar file

5951
03:22:38,000 --> 03:22:40,000
and stuff like that and it's just not

5952
03:22:40,000 --> 03:22:42,000
user friendly. But they are

5953
03:22:42,000 --> 03:22:44,000
working on new framework that's going to allow

5954
03:22:44,000 --> 03:22:46,000
the creating and installing of mods to

5955
03:22:46,000 --> 03:22:48,000
be easier and also, um,

5956
03:22:48,000 --> 03:22:50,000
releasing an official editing suite.

5957
03:22:50,000 --> 03:22:52,000
Also, they're thinking about

5958
03:22:52,000 --> 03:22:54,000
hosting their own private servers so that they

5959
03:22:54,000 --> 03:22:56,000
can have groups of people to build

5960
03:22:56,000 --> 03:22:58,000
their own persistent worlds and

5961
03:22:58,000 --> 03:23:00,000
experiment.

5962
03:23:00,000 --> 03:23:02,000
So that's kind of neat.

5963
03:23:02,000 --> 03:23:04,000
And then there was another comment.

5964
03:23:04,000 --> 03:23:06,000
Ubisoft wants to get

5965
03:23:06,000 --> 03:23:08,000
their full retail

5966
03:23:08,000 --> 03:23:10,000
games onto the Wii

5967
03:23:10,000 --> 03:23:12,000
U eShop

5968
03:23:12,000 --> 03:23:14,000
as soon as possible.

5969
03:23:14,000 --> 03:23:16,000
I can understand why because they

5970
03:23:16,000 --> 03:23:18,000
had a good portion of the games for the

5971
03:23:18,000 --> 03:23:20,000
Vita launch and I bet a lot of those sold digitally.

5972
03:23:20,000 --> 03:23:22,000
Yeah, when there's nothing

5973
03:23:22,000 --> 03:23:24,000
else to buy, your games look pretty appealing.

5974
03:23:24,000 --> 03:23:26,000
They have a lot of games.

5975
03:23:26,000 --> 03:23:28,000
Push button, get game.

5976
03:23:28,000 --> 03:23:30,000
You never even have to hand anybody money.

5977
03:23:30,000 --> 03:23:32,000
Of course, the problem with downloading the games

5978
03:23:32,000 --> 03:23:34,000
is remember you need to have

5979
03:23:34,000 --> 03:23:36,000
storage space which, uh,

5980
03:23:36,000 --> 03:23:38,000
you know, really, you're only going to be able to

5981
03:23:38,000 --> 03:23:40,000
get about one or two games on the

5982
03:23:40,000 --> 03:23:42,000
premium

5983
03:23:42,000 --> 03:23:44,000
model there. You're going to need an external hard drive

5984
03:23:44,000 --> 03:23:46,000
and it's

5985
03:23:46,000 --> 03:23:48,000
an extra step. I understand it's not

5986
03:23:48,000 --> 03:23:50,000
necessarily an expensive step but

5987
03:23:50,000 --> 03:23:52,000
it's still an extra step to have

5988
03:23:52,000 --> 03:23:54,000
a hard drive to

5989
03:23:54,000 --> 03:23:56,000
put those games

5990
03:23:56,000 --> 03:23:58,000
on.

5991
03:23:58,000 --> 03:24:00,000
That's it.

5992
03:24:00,000 --> 03:24:02,000
Alright. Well that does it.

5993
03:24:02,000 --> 03:24:04,000
It's almost a three and a half hour show

5994
03:24:04,000 --> 03:24:06,000
tonight. Well it helps that we

5995
03:24:06,000 --> 03:24:08,000
actually get to play the break tonight so

5996
03:24:08,000 --> 03:24:10,000
it helps give more

5997
03:24:10,000 --> 03:24:12,000
content on the podcast and

5998
03:24:12,000 --> 03:24:14,000
something for the worker bees who listen to our show on

5999
03:24:14,000 --> 03:24:16,000
Mondays and Tuesdays and throughout the week.

6000
03:24:16,000 --> 03:24:18,000
Something to listen to. I really want to

6001
03:24:18,000 --> 03:24:20,000
thank you all for tuning in tonight. I want to

6002
03:24:20,000 --> 03:24:22,000
thank Eddie for coming on the show and staying

6003
03:24:22,000 --> 03:24:24,000
for 45 minutes, close to

6004
03:24:24,000 --> 03:24:26,000
much more than the 15 to 20

6005
03:24:26,000 --> 03:24:28,000
I told him it would be. So big thanks to him

6006
03:24:28,000 --> 03:24:30,000
for coming out tonight. BimaniStyle.com

6007
03:24:30,000 --> 03:24:32,000
I want to thank Jen

6008
03:24:32,000 --> 03:24:34,000
from Girl Gamer Vogue for doing

6009
03:24:34,000 --> 03:24:36,000
that interview with DJ Rama S as well. It was great

6010
03:24:36,000 --> 03:24:38,000
to meet her through Rama

6011
03:24:38,000 --> 03:24:40,000
and I want to thank my

6012
03:24:40,000 --> 03:24:42,000
co-hosts for being here tonight too.

6013
03:24:42,000 --> 03:24:44,000
You're welcome.

6014
03:24:44,000 --> 03:24:46,000
I want to thank myself for being

6015
03:24:46,000 --> 03:24:48,000
here. Thank you Rob. Thank you

6016
03:24:48,000 --> 03:24:50,000
Rob because if it weren't for you I wouldn't be

6017
03:24:50,000 --> 03:24:52,000
here tonight. I wasn't even

6018
03:24:52,000 --> 03:24:54,000
supposed to be here today.

6019
03:24:54,000 --> 03:24:56,000
And I want to thank the listeners for showing

6020
03:24:56,000 --> 03:24:58,000
up through apparently seven

6021
03:24:58,000 --> 03:25:00,000
drops of the feed. They stayed with

6022
03:25:00,000 --> 03:25:02,000
the show tonight. I know right.

6023
03:25:02,000 --> 03:25:04,000
We got to figure out what the hell's. And like

6024
03:25:04,000 --> 03:25:06,000
Alan's not here so there's no bandwidth

6025
03:25:06,000 --> 03:25:08,000
coming out of the office tonight. No I don't think it's us

6026
03:25:08,000 --> 03:25:10,000
because I'm not getting disconnected

6027
03:25:10,000 --> 03:25:12,000
from chat so.

6028
03:25:12,000 --> 03:25:14,000
Something's up. I'm not running anything either so.

6029
03:25:14,000 --> 03:25:16,000
But anyway thank you

6030
03:25:16,000 --> 03:25:18,000
guys again for your support and if you got to the

6031
03:25:18,000 --> 03:25:20,000
whole end of the show you're listening on the podcast

6032
03:25:20,000 --> 03:25:22,000
you know what thank you too for listening to all

6033
03:25:22,000 --> 03:25:24,000
three and a half hours of it. You guys rock.

6034
03:25:24,000 --> 03:25:26,000
Of course I could be really evil and vindictive and put

6035
03:25:26,000 --> 03:25:28,000
the pass phrase like right here at the very very end so

6036
03:25:28,000 --> 03:25:30,000
people have to like. Oh just kidding.

6037
03:25:30,000 --> 03:25:32,000
Boogers. No it's not. Don't listen. It's not it.

6038
03:25:32,000 --> 03:25:34,000
Alright. Anyhow

6039
03:25:34,000 --> 03:25:36,000
let's go around and get everybody's

6040
03:25:36,000 --> 03:25:38,000
final thought. DarkSakura what's your final thought

6041
03:25:38,000 --> 03:25:40,000
tonight? I just got wind a certain bit

6042
03:25:40,000 --> 03:25:42,000
of news that I

6043
03:25:42,000 --> 03:25:44,000
actually think is super cool.

6044
03:25:44,000 --> 03:25:46,000
Have you ever heard of the company

6045
03:25:46,000 --> 03:25:48,000
Bob's Red Mill?

6046
03:25:48,000 --> 03:25:50,000
It makes like grains and cereals

6047
03:25:50,000 --> 03:25:52,000
and gluten free stuff and.

6048
03:25:52,000 --> 03:25:54,000
No but okay. You can find it like in the health

6049
03:25:54,000 --> 03:25:56,000
section that type of thing. Well

6050
03:25:56,000 --> 03:25:58,000
the owner actually just handed over the company

6051
03:25:58,000 --> 03:26:00,000
to the employees to make it employee

6052
03:26:00,000 --> 03:26:02,000
stock owned. Oh.

6053
03:26:02,000 --> 03:26:04,000
Meaning that all of

6054
03:26:04,000 --> 03:26:06,000
the stock

6055
03:26:06,000 --> 03:26:08,000
increases go directly into their retirement

6056
03:26:08,000 --> 03:26:10,000
funds. Nice. As a trust they can

6057
03:26:10,000 --> 03:26:12,000
also borrow from which I wish more

6058
03:26:12,000 --> 03:26:14,000
companies would be like that you know to

6059
03:26:14,000 --> 03:26:16,000
work for the benefit of their employees.

6060
03:26:16,000 --> 03:26:18,000
So just saying not all rich

6061
03:26:18,000 --> 03:26:20,000
people are assholes I guess.

6062
03:26:20,000 --> 03:26:22,000
Saying. Loki your final thought

6063
03:26:22,000 --> 03:26:24,000
tonight. My car sucks.

6064
03:26:24,000 --> 03:26:26,000
Hopefully I get a new car though.

6065
03:26:26,000 --> 03:26:28,000
Because we're looking at new cars now. Or

6066
03:26:28,000 --> 03:26:30,000
new to me cars.

6067
03:26:30,000 --> 03:26:32,000
Not necessarily new cars.

6068
03:26:32,000 --> 03:26:34,000
Less old.

6069
03:26:34,000 --> 03:26:36,000
Not necessarily.

6070
03:26:36,000 --> 03:26:38,000
Less mileage hopefully.

6071
03:26:38,000 --> 03:26:40,000
I want to thank everybody for listening

6072
03:26:40,000 --> 03:26:42,000
to the show tonight and sticking with it

6073
03:26:42,000 --> 03:26:44,000
and remember if you like our show just

6074
03:26:44,000 --> 03:26:46,000
tell a friend or two about the show. Help spread

6075
03:26:46,000 --> 03:26:48,000
the word. That's all we ask. We don't charge

6076
03:26:48,000 --> 03:26:50,000
for it or anything like that. So

6077
03:26:50,000 --> 03:26:52,000
just help spread the word about the VoG network

6078
03:26:52,000 --> 03:26:54,000
and what we're doing here. And that's

6079
03:26:54,000 --> 03:26:56,000
all we want. Just help grow our community.

6080
03:26:56,000 --> 03:26:58,000
That and vote in the podcast awards

6081
03:26:58,000 --> 03:27:00,000
if you can. It would be nice. It would be nice too.

6082
03:27:00,000 --> 03:27:02,000
Vote every day and then

6083
03:27:02,000 --> 03:27:04,000
get another IP and vote there too.

6084
03:27:04,000 --> 03:27:06,000
Don't cheat. Don't cheat.

6085
03:27:06,000 --> 03:27:08,000
Don't cheat. Just vote enthusiastically.

6086
03:27:08,000 --> 03:27:10,000
Just support multiple personalities.

6087
03:27:10,000 --> 03:27:12,000
You'll never know that you voted twice.

6088
03:27:12,000 --> 03:27:14,000
Alright stop. Alright.

6089
03:27:14,000 --> 03:27:16,000
That does it. My final thought.

6090
03:27:16,000 --> 03:27:18,000
I'm gonna go with an old classic.

6091
03:27:18,000 --> 03:27:20,000
My final thought tonight.

6092
03:27:20,000 --> 03:27:22,000
Be good to yourself. And

6093
03:27:22,000 --> 03:27:24,000
each other.

6094
03:27:24,000 --> 03:27:26,000
Be excellent to each other.

6095
03:27:26,000 --> 03:27:28,000
Have a wonderful week everybody. We'll be back

6096
03:27:28,000 --> 03:27:30,000
to do it all again next time. Same bat

6097
03:27:30,000 --> 03:27:32,000
time. Same bat channel.

6098
03:27:32,000 --> 03:27:34,000
Good night everybody.
