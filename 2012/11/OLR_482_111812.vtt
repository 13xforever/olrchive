WEBVTT

00:13.973 --> 00:25.849
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight, November 18th, 2012, the Wii U launches in North America, loyal Microsoft users are rewarded with a free Xbox 360, and PlayStation Plus is set to debut on the Vita.

00:31.457 --> 00:36.880
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.642
[SPEAKER_15]: It is Orange Lounge Radio.

00:40.102 --> 00:46.686
[SPEAKER_15]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle with my buddies.

00:47.026 --> 00:49.348
[SPEAKER_15]: Say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:49.687 --> 00:49.967
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

00:50.347 --> 00:50.947
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, how are you?

00:51.908 --> 00:53.168
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sick of donuts.

00:54.429 --> 00:54.909
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, God.

00:55.489 --> 00:56.810
[SPEAKER_15]: Not the hostess thing.

00:57.070 --> 00:59.091
[SPEAKER_15]: Were you one of those people clearing out 7-Eleven?

00:59.431 --> 00:59.671
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

00:59.911 --> 01:01.071
[SPEAKER_07]: No, actually not at all.

01:01.231 --> 01:03.572
[SPEAKER_07]: I was watching Under Sedation Live last night.

01:03.592 --> 01:04.833
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

01:07.017 --> 01:35.699
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were eating, well Travis was eating Ding Dongs, Twinkies, all kinds of stuff And all of a sudden I wanted donuts And this Martin Funnel around the corner from my house had them So I bought ten of them and gave a pack to a homeless guy And the rest of them are now in my fridge at home So should I have the urge to eat a donut Which I really shouldn't be because wheat makes me sick But I have them now I ate a pack today, I wish I hadn't

01:36.593 --> 01:52.973
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's the thing, like, you know, I'm not going to get into the whole why about it, but I'm going to tell you why the closure pisses me off is because Hostess also makes, and I don't know if this is a nationwide thing, it might be a regional thing, but they make this bread called Columbo bread, which is like the sourdough bread that is so flipping good.

01:52.993 --> 01:54.274
[SPEAKER_07]: Columbo is its own brand.

01:55.003 --> 01:55.884
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, but it's part of Hostess.

01:55.944 --> 01:57.945
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, right, but Columbo also makes frozen yogurt.

01:58.325 --> 01:58.665
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay.

01:59.005 --> 02:07.250
[SPEAKER_07]: Columbo also makes a bunch of other baked goods, but they also do... Because it used to be a major competitor for the company that my dad used to work for.

02:08.711 --> 02:11.133
[SPEAKER_07]: My dad used to work for a distributor called W.J.

02:11.153 --> 02:13.914
[SPEAKER_07]: Powell Company, and they did a different bread for their supplier.

02:14.335 --> 02:17.957
[SPEAKER_07]: Columbo was one of the big southern competitors.

02:18.690 --> 02:19.971
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I always thought they were based out here.

02:21.092 --> 02:22.553
[SPEAKER_14]: Because San Francisco is sourdough bread.

02:23.294 --> 02:26.096
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but they also do other kinds of breads.

02:26.216 --> 02:27.617
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a national bread company.

02:27.998 --> 02:31.561
[SPEAKER_07]: And they also do frozen yogurt and other, what's the word I'm thinking of?

02:32.101 --> 02:33.122
[SPEAKER_07]: Mass distribution foods.

02:33.262 --> 02:38.606
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, my point was, I'm not going to be able to get that sourdough bread anymore, at least until somebody buys the company or whatever.

02:38.626 --> 02:40.268
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you can go to fucking Boudin and get good bread.

02:40.288 --> 02:40.728
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

02:42.025 --> 02:43.786
[SPEAKER_15]: But I love Columbo bread, you shut up.

02:44.246 --> 02:46.507
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

02:46.927 --> 02:51.210
[SPEAKER_15]: I completely was ignoring everything you guys were talking about for the last minute or two.

02:51.310 --> 02:54.011
[SPEAKER_15]: Hostess, you don't have an opinion on Twinkies?

02:54.271 --> 02:55.412
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't like them.

02:56.312 --> 03:00.314
[SPEAKER_15]: I think people are going way too crazy over this, but it's because everybody remembers them from a kid.

03:00.794 --> 03:06.857
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know about you guys, but a Twinkie was like a staple dessert that came with your little bag lunch.

03:07.378 --> 03:08.958
[SPEAKER_13]: Holy crap, it's cake with frosting inside.

03:08.998 --> 03:09.779
[SPEAKER_13]: Ours were Star Crunch.

03:10.679 --> 03:14.061
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow, no one will ever be able to do that.

03:14.802 --> 03:15.622
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Little Debbie.

03:16.383 --> 03:19.605
[SPEAKER_15]: If you eat Little Debbie stuff, strawberry shortcakes are superior.

03:19.645 --> 03:20.325
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.

03:20.885 --> 03:23.007
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all about oat milk cream pies.

03:23.027 --> 03:31.572
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if they actually had a hostess end cap or whatever at our local grocery store, and now that's all Little Debbie stuff now.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.093
[SPEAKER_13]: They just completely removed it all.

03:33.313 --> 03:36.075
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if they had to return it all before their...

03:38.796 --> 03:42.398
[SPEAKER_15]: Little Debbie was probably the one that, you know, convinced them all to join the union and all that.

03:42.438 --> 03:42.758
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I'm kidding.

03:42.778 --> 03:43.218
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm kidding.

03:43.498 --> 03:44.038
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want to go there.

03:44.058 --> 03:44.258
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

03:44.639 --> 03:49.261
[SPEAKER_15]: Also say hello to the one, the only, Jason is joining us in the studio tonight.

03:49.421 --> 03:50.521
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello again, everybody.

03:50.781 --> 03:54.643
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. VX, Jason X, VX, YZ, QR, STUP.

03:54.963 --> 03:55.663
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

03:55.683 --> 03:56.384
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, for me.

03:56.604 --> 03:57.224
[SPEAKER_16]: How you doing?

03:58.905 --> 04:03.707
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm tired from zipping south of San Francisco and north of San Francisco and...

04:04.387 --> 04:06.929
[SPEAKER_16]: Train for much too long as usual.

04:07.469 --> 04:08.810
[SPEAKER_16]: But I'm here, so why not?

04:09.030 --> 04:10.791
[SPEAKER_15]: And commuting back and forth from Colorado.

04:11.112 --> 04:11.452
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh-huh.

04:12.372 --> 04:16.735
[SPEAKER_15]: Which, by the way, being that you... See, politics is pretty bad here.

04:17.696 --> 04:20.037
[SPEAKER_15]: Because, you know, it's bad everywhere.

04:20.077 --> 04:21.858
[SPEAKER_15]: But at least we're not a swing state.

04:22.159 --> 04:24.020
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody knew how California was going to vote.

04:24.080 --> 04:24.340
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah.

04:24.500 --> 04:29.563
[SPEAKER_15]: Your state, on the other hand, oh my god, you must be really fucking sick of politics.

04:29.663 --> 04:30.324
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is... I...

04:32.225 --> 04:33.165
[SPEAKER_16]: Not watching TV.

04:33.766 --> 04:42.649
[SPEAKER_16]: The only exposure to politics that I had was every once in a while that Facebook, either a sponsored post or a friend liking something that shows up on my feed.

04:43.069 --> 04:44.569
[SPEAKER_16]: It was surprisingly minimal.

04:45.290 --> 04:48.751
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't get too much of it, and I could very easily just skim the sponsored posts.

04:50.112 --> 04:59.916
[SPEAKER_16]: But the one thing that I did get is YouTube partner channels, the ones that actually monetize their channel, politic two-minute political ads every single video.

05:00.437 --> 05:07.500
[SPEAKER_16]: And there have been a couple of gaming shows, The Continue Show, Game Grumps, and then individually Jon, Sean, and Egoraptor.

05:07.860 --> 05:10.662
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been watching a ton of their videos, and they all monetize.

05:11.022 --> 05:16.925
[SPEAKER_16]: So the start of every episode, the end of every episode, for whatever reason, even though you can just skip it,

05:17.485 --> 05:23.330
[SPEAKER_16]: and the middle of particularly long episodes, political ad, political ad, political ad, political ad, political ad.

05:23.871 --> 05:27.474
[SPEAKER_16]: So it wasn't terribly specific for my region, but it still sucked.

05:27.574 --> 05:32.518
[SPEAKER_15]: This is why you don't see Wii U commercials anywhere because the politicians bought up all the ad space.

05:32.538 --> 05:33.239
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, they really did.

05:33.279 --> 05:33.679
[SPEAKER_16]: There it is.

05:34.200 --> 05:37.923
[SPEAKER_16]: My fun trivia about politics, since we're on the subject to get it out of the way...

05:38.643 --> 05:41.445
[SPEAKER_16]: How many presidential candidates were on the Colorado ballot?

05:41.465 --> 05:41.686
[SPEAKER_16]: How many?

05:41.726 --> 05:41.966
[SPEAKER_16]: Sixteen.

06:05.723 --> 06:06.023
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow.

06:06.223 --> 06:06.644
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

06:07.284 --> 06:16.231
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if it was sarcastic, but somebody told me that the only thing you have to do to get on the ballot is to have some kind of party application.

06:16.251 --> 06:18.552
[SPEAKER_16]: You have to have some kind of a political party and pay $500.

06:18.852 --> 06:26.418
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, okay, I'm not going to ask you how you voted in elections because that's a touchy subject and whatever, but also I do want to remind everybody.

06:26.678 --> 06:28.400
[SPEAKER_15]: Duke Nukem says don't fuck with Roseanne

06:49.998 --> 06:57.908
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not going to ask about the big one because that's still got a lot of ruffled feathers and so forth, but I gotta know.

06:59.110 --> 06:59.851
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

07:22.794 --> 07:26.295
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually eat all that snacky food because I'm just a fat pig.

07:26.415 --> 07:28.455
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, I'm not even smoking weed.

07:28.495 --> 07:29.195
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just a fat pig.

07:29.615 --> 07:32.816
[SPEAKER_16]: But how do you feel about all that, being in that state?

07:32.936 --> 07:44.478
[SPEAKER_16]: The best thing that's come out of this is the humor on Facebook and the local communities because of how many people I follow that live in the area go figure that the jokes, the pictures, the memes, they are actually pretty damn funny.

07:44.618 --> 07:47.579
[SPEAKER_15]: Getting high while you are actually high in the Mile High City?

07:49.300 --> 07:50.401
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a new one to me, actually.

07:50.421 --> 07:52.383
[SPEAKER_07]: I just like the one of the fog rolling in.

07:52.623 --> 07:53.363
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, yes.

07:53.764 --> 07:54.884
[SPEAKER_16]: Suddenly in Colorado.

07:56.085 --> 08:06.093
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, my favorite as well is the whole fact that it's a fucking cruel joke that Hostess closes the week after they legalize marijuana in two states.

08:06.133 --> 08:09.836
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's like, what kind of fucking stupid business decision was that?

08:11.449 --> 08:14.191
[SPEAKER_15]: You own Twinkies.

08:14.231 --> 08:15.913
[SPEAKER_15]: You were sitting on a gold mine.

08:16.594 --> 08:24.442
[SPEAKER_07]: They were too busy giving themselves raises and not worrying about things like benefits and pensions.

08:24.722 --> 08:26.464
[SPEAKER_15]: Fucking greedy ass fuckers.

08:26.604 --> 08:40.788
[SPEAKER_15]: But since we're all under the age of 50, I'm sure we can agree that yay to those states that finally voted the right way and either legalized or stopped the banning of marriage and all that.

08:40.928 --> 08:42.768
[SPEAKER_15]: So yay to Washington and all that.

08:42.908 --> 08:48.470
[SPEAKER_16]: It makes it more difficult because we have to watch out for state officials.

08:48.750 --> 08:53.651
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't have to watch out for state officials, but when we hear about a federal raid, then it becomes a little bit more dangerous because...

08:54.271 --> 08:58.814
[SPEAKER_16]: As the disclaimer goes, it is still illegal at the federal level, which ultimately supersedes state law.

08:59.775 --> 09:00.055
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

09:00.115 --> 09:01.656
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyhow, we got to get to video games.

09:01.696 --> 09:03.177
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been a busy week in video games.

09:03.217 --> 09:04.318
[SPEAKER_15]: We're getting too political.

09:05.239 --> 09:05.559
[SPEAKER_15]: Shut up.

09:05.599 --> 09:06.760
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't talk about politics.

09:06.860 --> 09:08.101
[SPEAKER_15]: I tuned in to hear about games.

09:08.581 --> 09:08.941
[SPEAKER_15]: Fine.

09:09.302 --> 09:10.462
[SPEAKER_15]: We can talk games.

09:10.903 --> 09:16.066
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's talk about Wii U. Obviously, Wii U. Yeah, everybody's heard that joke.

09:16.466 --> 09:21.390
[SPEAKER_15]: But in part to Bobby, who does the show before us every week.

09:21.890 --> 09:23.352
[SPEAKER_15]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

09:38.557 --> 09:39.938
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, did you buy the Wii U?

09:40.138 --> 09:40.779
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not a whore.

09:41.879 --> 09:44.021
[SPEAKER_15]: So that means it's between Loki and myself.

09:44.101 --> 09:47.283
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, Loki, you do work for the distribution company.

09:47.563 --> 09:49.064
[SPEAKER_15]: I do work for the distribution company.

09:49.124 --> 09:53.167
[SPEAKER_15]: And you've been shading the shit out of Nintendo on the past few episodes of the show.

09:53.367 --> 09:53.907
[SPEAKER_15]: That's true.

09:54.027 --> 09:56.509
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you have a change of heart and did you buy a Wii U?

09:57.249 --> 09:58.270
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I already own a Wii.

09:59.665 --> 10:00.466
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, it was me.

10:00.626 --> 10:01.988
[SPEAKER_15]: I bought the Wii U this morning.

10:02.008 --> 10:02.568
[SPEAKER_15]: Surprise.

10:02.628 --> 10:03.329
[SPEAKER_15]: I did, yep.

10:04.891 --> 10:06.693
[SPEAKER_15]: So let's talk about the Wii U a little bit.

10:06.833 --> 10:09.516
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess I'll start since, you know, I actually have one.

10:10.017 --> 10:10.878
[SPEAKER_15]: No, here's the thing.

10:11.439 --> 10:14.222
[SPEAKER_15]: I went back and forth on that Wii U thing a lot.

10:14.782 --> 10:16.424
[SPEAKER_15]: I made a very cryptic tweet last night.

10:17.285 --> 10:18.825
[SPEAKER_15]: Talking about, because here's the thing.

10:19.166 --> 10:28.828
[SPEAKER_15]: I chose not to go out and stand in line and all that stuff for the Wii U last night because Irene, who a lot of you old school OLR listeners know because she used to be on the show all the time.

10:29.328 --> 10:34.230
[SPEAKER_15]: Irene was visiting and I make it sound like she doesn't live here, but she came over.

10:34.310 --> 10:35.370
[SPEAKER_15]: We went out for her birthday.

10:35.710 --> 10:40.311
[SPEAKER_15]: So I chose to go get drunk at a gay bar rather than go stand out in line.

10:40.511 --> 10:41.672
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I made the right decision.

10:42.472 --> 10:44.574
[SPEAKER_15]: So I pretty much convinced myself, you know what?

10:44.654 --> 10:46.435
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't need a Wii U. I'm not going to get one.

10:46.695 --> 10:47.276
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm over it.

10:47.556 --> 10:49.137
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I'll get one in January or whatever.

10:49.798 --> 10:55.922
[SPEAKER_15]: And then this morning, I fire up the Target app and I just look out of curiosity.

10:56.382 --> 10:57.443
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like 11 o'clock.

10:58.769 --> 11:27.155
[SPEAKER_15]: they're still in stock at the store nearby let's just go take a look walk out of there with my Wii U Deluxe set not only are you a whore I found one at noon still on a shelf in Target not only are you a whore, you're a waffling whore so they're not sold out like the Wii oh I guess they probably are now to be fair because there were two left and I bought one see Nintendo, Apple helps you sell your stuff if you're going to pick any mobile platform Apple

11:27.795 --> 11:29.756
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure that isn't a surprise to hear me say, ever.

11:30.156 --> 11:41.643
[SPEAKER_15]: So to be honest, I've only really been able to spend like 30 minutes playing actual games on the console because as I'm sure you all heard, there's that massive 5GB update and that took an hour out and I had to do other stuff to prep for the show.

11:42.003 --> 11:45.565
[SPEAKER_15]: So I didn't have a whole lot of time to really sit down with the Wii U, but I'm going to tell you like this.

11:46.205 --> 11:51.128
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the impression I got of the Wii U with the little time I had playing it.

11:51.548 --> 11:53.071
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

12:03.596 --> 12:05.598
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

12:28.917 --> 12:29.797
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

12:52.822 --> 12:53.363
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

13:08.360 --> 13:08.861
[SPEAKER_07]: All that stuff.

13:08.881 --> 13:23.493
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a reason I have DarkSakura tell that story because that's how I kind of feel about the Wii U is that like there's these doors that you'll open and there's a wall there and there'll be like a half-finished tunnel and it's like, oh, you can click on Amazon Prime and then it's like, surprise, it's fucking nothing.

13:23.974 --> 13:24.895
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, like that gif.

13:25.235 --> 13:32.261
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like there's all these weird unfinished things and I really feel like so much of the infrastructure they're building as they go along.

13:32.481 --> 13:32.681
[SPEAKER_15]: Like,

13:33.402 --> 13:35.385
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

13:49.424 --> 13:50.926
[SPEAKER_15]: I also really love the subtle touch.

14:08.068 --> 14:09.069
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a neat little thing.

14:09.089 --> 14:09.950
[SPEAKER_15]: I like that.

14:27.734 --> 14:31.497
[SPEAKER_15]: So yes, Loki, I know you're dying to comment on my consumer whoredom, so please.

14:31.677 --> 14:36.241
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm just saying that I don't know why you're surprised that there's stuff that's not finished for the Wii U launch.

14:36.261 --> 14:39.863
[SPEAKER_13]: They did the same thing with the Wii, the DS, the 3DS.

14:40.084 --> 14:45.628
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just Nintendo, and they're... Well, we want people to buy our stuff, but oh hey, it's not complete.

14:47.506 --> 14:51.030
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, all those wonderful features that we were pimping out during our E3 conferences.

14:51.090 --> 14:52.131
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, TV!

14:52.391 --> 14:53.092
[SPEAKER_13]: Nintendo TV.

14:53.472 --> 14:54.273
[SPEAKER_13]: Nope, not fucking there.

14:55.034 --> 14:56.255
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, hey, Rayman Legends.

14:56.335 --> 14:57.476
[SPEAKER_13]: Really awesome launch game.

14:57.636 --> 14:58.237
[SPEAKER_13]: Launch window.

14:58.437 --> 15:00.980
[SPEAKER_13]: By launch window, he means coming out five months later.

15:02.648 --> 15:03.489
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, come on!

15:28.829 --> 15:29.990
[SPEAKER_15]: Your typical pack-in game.

15:30.831 --> 15:35.415
[SPEAKER_15]: I only did a little bit of Nintendo Land, but I like some of the variety in some of the games.

15:35.495 --> 15:41.080
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think it's Wii Sports level going to draw people in, but I think it's a neat way to show off the console.

15:42.661 --> 15:48.286
[SPEAKER_15]: I did a video chat too with Shane, and it's okay.

15:48.467 --> 15:50.849
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, the quality is kind of comparable to FaceTime.

15:51.489 --> 16:16.859
[SPEAKER_15]: it's a little slow to connect and then like it does this really weird transition thing when you connect to the other person where it like ripples in and it plays like this music like like it's like this big debut like oh my god I'm gonna video chat like ta-da and then like oh hey it's Shane like I haven't seen him before like you know like it's just like oh your prince is in another castle but here's Shane

16:20.916 --> 16:21.456
[SPEAKER_13]: Poor Shane.

16:22.656 --> 16:27.718
[SPEAKER_15]: But the quality was good enough that I could see his doggy running down the stairs in the back of the room.

16:27.758 --> 16:28.418
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was like, oh.

16:28.778 --> 16:35.159
[SPEAKER_15]: Although when he was looking at my setup, Jason was sitting back here at the table.

16:35.299 --> 16:36.960
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm like, Shane, say hi to Jason.

16:37.080 --> 16:38.040
[SPEAKER_15]: He's like, hi.

16:38.220 --> 16:40.641
[SPEAKER_15]: He's doing that whole, I don't know who I'm saying hi to.

16:40.961 --> 16:45.902
[SPEAKER_15]: And he told me later, he's like, yeah, I couldn't see Jason, but I could totally make out the Wendy's bag that was sitting on the table.

16:45.962 --> 16:46.882
[SPEAKER_15]: So I know where he ate dinner.

16:48.823 --> 16:49.223
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeesh.

16:50.503 --> 16:50.743
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

16:50.783 --> 16:52.244
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's how I really want to be remembered.

16:52.844 --> 16:53.645
[SPEAKER_16]: My last meal.

16:56.206 --> 16:57.386
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you can draw on it.

16:57.886 --> 17:01.348
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, so I was writing like hello and like all that stupid stuff.

17:01.728 --> 17:06.450
[SPEAKER_15]: So anyway, my time with the Wii U has been interesting so far.

17:06.670 --> 17:08.731
[SPEAKER_15]: I think they're going to kind of keep adding to it.

17:09.051 --> 17:11.612
[SPEAKER_15]: And at the end of the day, if you want a Wii U, you just have to ask yourself,

17:12.252 --> 17:13.453
[SPEAKER_15]: How bad do I want the games?

17:13.814 --> 17:17.316
[SPEAKER_15]: Because the infrastructure right now is not really where it's at.

17:17.777 --> 17:22.700
[SPEAKER_15]: There's still a lot of... I want to be able to explain Miiverse to all of you.

17:22.920 --> 17:25.502
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't fucking understand it at all.

17:25.742 --> 17:30.246
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought it was supposed to be like Twitter, but you don't really make public posts.

17:30.626 --> 17:36.290
[SPEAKER_15]: You can either send messages to people or you comment on community posts, which in turn are public.

17:37.331 --> 17:39.052
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't fucking get it.

17:39.953 --> 17:40.533
[SPEAKER_13]: It's okay.

17:41.093 --> 17:43.074
[SPEAKER_13]: Nintendo doesn't fucking get it either.

17:43.474 --> 17:45.855
[SPEAKER_13]: They just put this shit together and like, done.

17:46.095 --> 17:48.116
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks like Facebook or Twitter.

17:48.496 --> 17:51.317
[SPEAKER_13]: We're gonna just say this is our online network right here.

17:53.037 --> 17:58.679
[SPEAKER_15]: Ragenator in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, So, what was the TTP for the newer listeners?

17:58.699 --> 18:01.200
[SPEAKER_15]: That's an old OLR acronym for time to penis.

18:01.260 --> 18:05.542
[SPEAKER_15]: Whenever there is a new piece of hardware, we always measure what's gonna be the time before somebody puts their dick in it.

18:05.562 --> 18:06.942
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I'm sure it was a few seconds, but

18:07.603 --> 18:10.547
[SPEAKER_15]: No, because he's asking, what was the TTP with the video chat?

18:11.048 --> 18:14.153
[SPEAKER_15]: Shane and I were just friends, so that was not a thing.

18:14.634 --> 18:19.541
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, but I'm sure somebody else... But Rob totally had a penis up on his iPhone.

18:20.883 --> 18:21.765
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kidding, I don't know.

18:22.358 --> 18:26.023
[SPEAKER_15]: TigerClaw says, one thing's for sure, expect Rob to post nothing but kiddie pics on the Wii U.

18:37.558 --> 19:07.030
[SPEAKER_15]: um I would love to post a broad like I would tell if you want to follow me on uh the me-verse thing although I'm not sure what that will accomplish but I'm I'm Rob Roberts so it's all one word Rob Roberts so you can follow me or whatever and um I'll be happy to post kitty pictures publicly but I can't like it won't let me do it like I don't know like unless I go randomly reply to some community message like oh no one care about the uh Skylanders community let me just go post my kitty pics here

19:09.713 --> 19:13.035
[SPEAKER_15]: All the Nintendo communities in Miiverse right now are just game communities.

19:13.595 --> 19:15.155
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, I need a kitty community.

19:15.656 --> 19:17.156
[SPEAKER_15]: Where's my lolcat community?

19:18.497 --> 19:18.817
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyhow.

19:19.757 --> 19:22.078
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, they don't understand online.

19:22.438 --> 19:24.059
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just the way it is.

19:24.359 --> 19:26.179
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, now they have online.

19:26.199 --> 19:29.541
[SPEAKER_13]: They have something that sort of resembles what we had last generation.

19:30.041 --> 19:32.222
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, if we're going to consider this another generation.

19:32.302 --> 19:35.303
[SPEAKER_13]: But they just don't get it still.

19:35.883 --> 19:36.043
[SPEAKER_13]: And...

19:37.631 --> 19:38.011
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

19:38.172 --> 19:41.455
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just... Enjoy, I guess.

19:42.196 --> 19:43.076
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm gonna be honest.

19:43.197 --> 19:44.037
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm gonna be honest.

19:44.138 --> 19:47.881
[SPEAKER_15]: My early thought, and keep in mind, early impressions can sometimes change.

19:48.081 --> 19:49.042
[SPEAKER_15]: So here's my disclaimer.

19:49.082 --> 19:50.184
[SPEAKER_15]: This is my early thought.

19:51.044 --> 19:55.489
[SPEAKER_15]: I kind of think the Wii U is not... I mean, it's not a next-gen system.

19:55.689 --> 19:56.089
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not.

19:56.850 --> 20:00.514
[SPEAKER_15]: It is more the pinnacle of this generation.

20:02.003 --> 20:29.639
[SPEAKER_15]: I get what they're trying to do with the whole controller thing it is kind of a neat experience I'll give them that it's you know I hazed it a lot earlier on but that I'll be that that tablet is really fucking crystal clear and it does it does enhance some of the games it's pretty neat but I'm not sure like I really don't feel like I am in the next gen of gaming or this is really pushing the envelope as far as graphics and everything go no it's more like Nintendo's finally playing catch up yay they're caught up

20:30.640 --> 20:32.042
[SPEAKER_15]: Until next year.

20:32.142 --> 20:34.425
[SPEAKER_15]: Now I get to finally play Mario in HD and so forth.

20:35.427 --> 20:36.949
[SPEAKER_15]: At least that's where I'm at right now.

20:37.910 --> 20:41.876
[SPEAKER_15]: Ranma in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says Reggie said it wasn't next gen.

20:42.659 --> 20:50.443
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know, that's a fair response, because we as gamers make all this shit a competition sometimes.

20:51.703 --> 20:57.386
[SPEAKER_15]: And Nintendo is trying to say, wait a minute, wait a minute, no, we're not a next gen, we're the other gen.

20:57.426 --> 20:59.187
[SPEAKER_15]: It was the exact same thing with the Wii.

20:59.307 --> 21:00.347
[SPEAKER_15]: It was the exact same thing with the Wii.

21:00.367 --> 21:02.728
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just an easy way to argue that your system sucks.

21:02.808 --> 21:03.429
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's...

21:04.349 --> 21:04.889
[SPEAKER_13]: Hold on, though.

21:05.109 --> 21:06.169
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not competing with anybody.

21:06.189 --> 21:07.350
[SPEAKER_13]: We're in our own market.

21:07.370 --> 21:08.570
[SPEAKER_13]: Therefore, we're number one.

21:08.670 --> 21:09.690
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that's stupid.

21:09.710 --> 21:13.491
[SPEAKER_15]: But the Wii sold more than PlayStations and Xboxes.

21:13.571 --> 21:14.492
[SPEAKER_15]: That is fact.

21:14.592 --> 21:15.632
[SPEAKER_15]: You cannot dispute that.

21:15.672 --> 21:18.272
[SPEAKER_15]: The Wii was the winner of those last three consoles.

21:18.312 --> 21:19.953
[SPEAKER_15]: Whether you like it or not, that's the way it is.

21:20.233 --> 21:21.873
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's because they had a great packing game.

21:21.893 --> 21:22.594
[SPEAKER_13]: Everyone bought it.

21:22.794 --> 21:24.414
[SPEAKER_16]: Not gonna happen this generation, though.

21:25.454 --> 21:28.515
[SPEAKER_16]: Nothing wrong with that last generation, but I think I agree with him about the Wii U.

21:29.437 --> 21:46.873
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think I said as much when I called after I was at the launch experience is that because of the higher tier in order to actually have a pack-in and the fact that there is not something that you just drop into, it's been forever since I played Wii Sports, you turn it on, you pick a game, and you start playing.

21:47.353 --> 21:53.799
[SPEAKER_16]: There are a lot more hurdles from what I've seen of the Wii U, and that's unfortunately quite detrimental to...

21:55.260 --> 22:23.031
[SPEAKER_13]: and the thing with the Wii is just or the Wii U is that they assume they're really targeting this at people that bought Wiis they're not targeting this at new consumers because if you're a new consumer then guess what you can't play multiplayer because you got one fucking controller and no other controllers with it you have to go buy all those $40 controllers and all the nunchucks that go along with that and all the other accessories that you need to play those games because once again they marketed this at people that own the Wii and

22:23.591 --> 22:51.796
[SPEAKER_13]: and those people that own the Wii some of whom yes will buy the system but like you're not gonna see old folks homes or anything like that purchasing this to play Nintendo Land no one's gonna give a fuck because they're playing Wii Sports still I just you know what okay I gotta wrap up because I gotta go to the next thing because we have another big thing coming up even before gaming weeks we got another big thing and you know I seriously have nothing to say about any of this well really as a gamer you have no opinion because I don't have one probably not gonna get one mm-hmm

22:52.543 --> 22:53.524
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, yeah, it's nice.

22:54.064 --> 22:59.469
[SPEAKER_07]: I told Dan I kind of want to win, you know, but I can't talk about something that I don't own.

22:59.929 --> 23:04.613
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's also, it's not something, and I say this to everybody, it's not something you really like have to have.

23:04.953 --> 23:05.173
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

23:05.714 --> 23:08.196
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, like, you know what I'm more excited about?

23:08.656 --> 23:09.297
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking Omega.

23:10.785 --> 23:11.566
[SPEAKER_15]: and that's what you're into.

23:12.226 --> 23:13.207
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's the thing.

23:13.227 --> 23:16.549
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to start to wrap this up and I want to make this comment.

23:16.589 --> 23:21.953
[SPEAKER_15]: Despite all of that that you guys are saying with Wii U, I really think this thing is down a similar path as 3DS.

23:22.113 --> 23:28.518
[SPEAKER_15]: I realize 3DS to some extent is struggling as well, but I think Wii U is going to gain a lot of steam next holiday because you know

23:29.198 --> 23:30.619
[SPEAKER_15]: That big holiday game's coming out.

23:30.659 --> 23:32.320
[SPEAKER_15]: That Zelda's coming out next Christmas.

23:32.560 --> 23:34.801
[SPEAKER_15]: Or the big Metroid or something.

23:34.821 --> 23:36.282
[SPEAKER_15]: There will be a huge game.

23:36.802 --> 23:43.125
[SPEAKER_15]: And one thing Nintendo does very well, the characters in the story, love it or not, they have rabid fans.

23:43.365 --> 23:51.229
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's gonna sway a lot of people to picking those up even next holiday, even with new Xbox and new PlayStation possibly out on the market.

23:51.570 --> 23:54.051
[SPEAKER_15]: And I guess this is a whole other can of worms.

23:54.211 --> 23:55.612
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we'll have new Xbox.

23:55.672 --> 23:57.913
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not so sure right now we're gonna have new PlayStation next year.

23:58.513 --> 24:00.954
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't see why they should be in a rush.

24:01.414 --> 24:03.255
[SPEAKER_16]: Why should there be a new Xbox by the same token?

24:04.156 --> 24:10.318
[SPEAKER_13]: Honestly, I don't think it's really going to be... They're not going to be worried about it because the longer they take on their systems, the better they're going to be.

24:10.659 --> 24:14.821
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you think about it, if they're... Okay, let's just say this system is not next-gen.

24:14.841 --> 24:16.101
[SPEAKER_13]: This system is current-gen.

24:16.922 --> 24:18.542
[SPEAKER_13]: How are you going to compete against the Xbox?

24:18.762 --> 24:24.105
[SPEAKER_13]: The Xbox or the PlayStation 3, for that matter, they have a huge library of games and they're probably going to be cheaper.

24:24.765 --> 24:27.808
[SPEAKER_13]: So, why should I... And that's the other problem, too.

24:28.028 --> 24:36.855
[SPEAKER_13]: I have an Xbox 360 and a PlayStation 3, and even if I just had one of those, there's no need for me to buy a Wii U unless I really want to play New Super Mario Bros.

24:36.915 --> 24:45.422
[SPEAKER_13]: in HD, which, you know, it's kind of like, you know, I probably would have already played it on the Wii or on the 3DS or on the DS.

24:46.482 --> 24:47.643
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's just not that...

24:48.664 --> 24:51.546
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's just like throwing a fresh coat of paint on an old game.

24:51.826 --> 24:52.426
[SPEAKER_13]: It's fun.

24:53.667 --> 24:54.248
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, cool.

24:54.288 --> 24:55.468
[SPEAKER_13]: Mario games are fun.

24:55.608 --> 24:57.069
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can play New Super Mario Bros.

24:57.249 --> 24:59.451
[SPEAKER_13]: on the Wii, on the 3DS, on the DS.

25:00.051 --> 25:08.276
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't need to buy a brand new system for $350 plus the game to play it.

25:08.356 --> 25:09.137
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not worth $410. $410.

25:11.218 --> 25:11.519
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

25:11.559 --> 25:15.384
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a whole nother year to debate this shit until the next console comes out.

25:15.724 --> 25:17.166
[SPEAKER_15]: I do want to transition to something else here.

25:17.206 --> 25:18.027
[SPEAKER_16]: Jason, final thought.

25:19.429 --> 25:21.852
[SPEAKER_16]: Long-term claim chowder because of his kid.

25:21.913 --> 25:25.818
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki's going to be surprisingly in Nintendo camp in about four years, five years.

25:26.391 --> 25:28.413
[SPEAKER_16]: Nah, he'll train the kid to love Call of Duty.

25:29.213 --> 25:30.534
[SPEAKER_13]: He's not going to love Call of Duty.

25:30.894 --> 25:33.976
[SPEAKER_13]: He can love whatever he wants, but that still doesn't matter.

25:34.437 --> 25:36.438
[SPEAKER_13]: Because if he wants to play a Mario game, guess what?

25:36.959 --> 25:37.799
[SPEAKER_13]: There's the Nintendo.

25:37.939 --> 25:39.100
[SPEAKER_13]: There's the Super Nintendo.

25:39.420 --> 25:40.341
[SPEAKER_13]: There's the Game Boy.

25:40.381 --> 25:41.082
[SPEAKER_13]: There's the DS.

25:41.122 --> 25:41.682
[SPEAKER_13]: There's the Wii.

25:41.982 --> 25:44.864
[SPEAKER_13]: I have plenty of Nintendo consoles to play all these stupid games.

25:45.084 --> 25:48.847
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't need to buy a brand new system to play New Super Mario Bros.

25:48.867 --> 25:49.808
[SPEAKER_13]: with fresh coat of paint.

25:50.428 --> 25:51.029
[SPEAKER_13]: No, forget it.

25:51.469 --> 25:52.690
[SPEAKER_13]: Yet you already have that many of them.

25:53.846 --> 25:56.127
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I don't have those systems, but I have emulators.

25:56.287 --> 26:01.869
[SPEAKER_13]: I can emulate all those systems, and I have a Wii, which, let's see, the last time I played that Wii was a few years ago.

26:02.309 --> 26:06.190
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, actually, it was a couple months ago, but that was my wife playing the Wii.

26:06.330 --> 26:17.034
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, we're going to go to a call, because we're going to go have a chat with Rama, and I believe he has a friend there with him, too, from... Hi, you there, Rama?

26:17.814 --> 26:18.435
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm right here.

26:18.675 --> 26:20.397
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, and you have a buddy with you, right?

26:20.517 --> 26:21.799
[SPEAKER_15]: From AJS?

26:21.859 --> 26:23.281
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, hold on for one second.

26:23.301 --> 26:25.263
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to bring him right in.

26:25.463 --> 26:26.084
[SPEAKER_04]: He's right there.

26:26.324 --> 26:27.325
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, hey, look at that.

26:27.425 --> 26:28.386
[SPEAKER_15]: Conference call on Skype.

26:28.426 --> 26:29.047
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, how you doing?

26:29.968 --> 26:31.390
[SPEAKER_15]: Doing fabulous.

26:32.972 --> 26:33.933
[SPEAKER_15]: Forgive me if I'm saying this wrong.

26:33.953 --> 26:34.393
[SPEAKER_15]: Taiki?

26:35.174 --> 26:35.555
[SPEAKER_15]: Taiki.

26:35.795 --> 26:36.896
[SPEAKER_15]: Taiki, how you doing?

26:37.830 --> 26:38.330
[SPEAKER_15]: Fabulous.

26:38.390 --> 26:38.951
[SPEAKER_15]: Fantastic.

26:39.191 --> 26:39.511
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome.

26:39.551 --> 26:41.793
[SPEAKER_15]: So you guys were at the launch event last night, right?

26:42.613 --> 26:43.174
[SPEAKER_15]: That's correct, sir.

26:43.674 --> 26:49.098
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I'm guessing all them media cameras were everywhere and it was hype, hype, hype, hype.

26:49.138 --> 26:49.999
[SPEAKER_15]: Was it hype, hype, hype?

26:51.800 --> 26:52.260
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

26:52.460 --> 26:55.362
[SPEAKER_04]: To me it was a lot of hype and a lot of the chill, chill, chill.

26:55.943 --> 26:56.123
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah?

26:57.076 --> 27:04.119
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, from what I observed, some media, but you know how media goes.

27:04.239 --> 27:07.340
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a little directed.

27:07.360 --> 27:13.483
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo told them where to go, what to shoot, at least as far as I could tell.

27:15.524 --> 27:22.487
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a lot going on in the crowd, but it seemed like the media really didn't want to be there.

27:23.827 --> 27:26.829
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that's my opinion.

27:26.969 --> 27:32.492
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what though, from my limited time when I was studying to be originally in college, I was going to be a broadcast journalist.

27:32.572 --> 27:33.013
[SPEAKER_15]: Here I am.

27:34.053 --> 27:34.914
[SPEAKER_15]: That doesn't surprise me.

27:35.074 --> 27:37.375
[SPEAKER_15]: They get very unenthusiastic about a lot of things.

27:37.515 --> 27:44.319
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's just, you know, you build up a resistance to hype, you know, but anyway.

27:44.619 --> 27:52.664
[SPEAKER_15]: So you guys both went as media to cover it and so forth for AJS and OLR, but did you guys walk out of there with one?

27:53.064 --> 27:53.224
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

27:53.264 --> 27:53.444
[SPEAKER_15]: Nope.

27:53.605 --> 27:57.067
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, did they sell out that night?

28:11.517 --> 28:13.158
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but there was a considerable line.

28:14.098 --> 28:17.739
[SPEAKER_06]: After the event ended, we all went to McDonald's to get a little nosh.

28:17.799 --> 28:24.981
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we left, heading back to the train station, we noticed that there were still about, I would say about 50 to 100 people still in line.

28:25.181 --> 28:25.501
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

28:26.882 --> 28:37.365
[SPEAKER_04]: And from my knowledge, the line went up until about 5 o'clock in the morning because some people on my Facebook, oh, let's just say one of my friends kind of went home dejected.

28:38.305 --> 28:39.165
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, ouch.

28:40.206 --> 28:40.946
[SPEAKER_15]: That's unfortunate.

28:41.636 --> 28:45.461
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, well you guys are at the event and you guys got some interviews and so forth.

28:45.541 --> 28:47.444
[SPEAKER_15]: So we want to play those here on the show.

28:47.544 --> 28:49.787
[SPEAKER_15]: So tell us about what I'm playing.

28:51.089 --> 28:54.133
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the ones with the market share, that was Taiki's idea.

28:54.193 --> 28:55.255
[SPEAKER_04]: Taiki, you take that one.

28:56.095 --> 29:02.539
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so we were at the Duane Reade across the street from the Nintendo World Store, you know, preparing.

29:03.119 --> 29:06.982
[SPEAKER_06]: We had about four hours to go, so I'm thinking it's time for some Red Bull.

29:07.022 --> 29:13.066
[SPEAKER_06]: So we leave, and I'm looking at the line, and I was thinking there's probably something interesting here.

29:13.146 --> 29:16.167
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, he's got a lot of people here who obviously enjoy fun.

29:17.949 --> 29:19.269
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's bring it down a little.

29:19.309 --> 29:20.911
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do something a little more fun.

29:22.131 --> 29:26.054
[SPEAKER_06]: My thought was we need to do something with these people in line.

29:26.594 --> 29:31.998
[SPEAKER_06]: You've seen those segments on Conan where they send someone like Triumph or whoever to the line.

29:32.198 --> 29:38.422
[SPEAKER_06]: I was thinking we need to do something like that but not insulting but very funny and very much inside gaming.

29:39.602 --> 29:46.487
[SPEAKER_06]: So my idea was let's start asking people who look like they're a little older who will know older consoles or

29:47.116 --> 29:55.762
[SPEAKER_06]: What will the Wii U do to the market share for, say, the Dreamcast or the Neo Geo or the Jaguar?

29:56.182 --> 30:03.207
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, let's check out some of these interviews with people and gauging the impact of the Wii U on the market share.

30:03.988 --> 30:04.828
[SPEAKER_06]: We found this man in line.

30:05.749 --> 30:06.329
[SPEAKER_06]: What is your name, sir?

30:07.530 --> 30:08.751
[SPEAKER_06]: John, but you can call me the Hux.

30:09.451 --> 30:09.852
[SPEAKER_06]: The Hux?

30:11.473 --> 30:11.833
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

30:11.873 --> 30:14.275
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Wii U, what do you think?

30:15.380 --> 30:16.881
[SPEAKER_21]: It looks like a very interesting console.

30:17.081 --> 30:17.762
[SPEAKER_21]: Good innovation.

30:19.263 --> 30:22.925
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm really impressed with the changes they've made to the network specifically.

30:23.706 --> 30:25.287
[SPEAKER_21]: But some of the launch titles look good.

30:25.327 --> 30:26.808
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sure it's only going to go uphill from here.

30:28.309 --> 30:29.930
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm really impressed with the controller as well.

30:31.211 --> 30:36.074
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, and speaking of the controller, how do you think that the Wii U is going to impact the Dreamcast market share?

30:36.601 --> 31:01.926
[SPEAKER_21]: the Dreamcast market share Dreamcast is probably the best system, number one and all I know is, if I want to you're very brave saying that in front of the Nintendo World Store, sir hey Dreamcast go buy one buy some CD-ROMs go get a disc burner I don't know what you're going to do put some games on there, play that up this man knows what's up this man knows what's up

31:06.981 --> 31:07.441
[SPEAKER_06]: Your name, sir?

31:07.681 --> 31:07.981
[SPEAKER_22]: Jason.

31:08.521 --> 31:08.902
[SPEAKER_06]: Jason.

31:08.922 --> 31:10.342
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think of the Wii U?

31:10.682 --> 31:15.603
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm really excited for the Wii U. I've always been a hardcore Nintendo fan, so... What do you think of the new controller?

31:15.843 --> 31:16.844
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's awesome, dude.

31:17.064 --> 31:19.004
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's a big step forward in gaming in general.

31:19.905 --> 31:24.246
[SPEAKER_06]: So, what do you think that the Wii U is going to do to the TurboGrafx-16's market share?

31:26.606 --> 31:27.467
[SPEAKER_23]: Is that a serious question?

31:28.427 --> 31:28.967
[SPEAKER_06]: Dead serious.

31:30.387 --> 31:30.828
[SPEAKER_23]: You know what?

31:30.968 --> 31:32.148
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not even worried about market shares.

31:33.833 --> 31:36.736
[SPEAKER_06]: So, wait a minute, we got the new Mario game, how do you think that's going to compare to Bonk?

31:38.057 --> 31:39.378
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, Bonk has its place.

31:39.779 --> 31:41.060
[SPEAKER_23]: You can't take that away from Bonk.

31:42.922 --> 31:43.562
[SPEAKER_06]: Man knows his stuff.

31:44.163 --> 31:44.543
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's go.

31:45.744 --> 31:46.345
[SPEAKER_06]: And your name, sir?

31:47.446 --> 31:48.867
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Plinio Busato.

31:49.828 --> 31:52.330
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, and what do you think of the Wii U?

31:52.350 --> 31:53.532
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's going to be awesome.

31:53.692 --> 31:55.033
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm really excited about that.

31:55.373 --> 31:55.874
[SPEAKER_12]: I really am.

31:56.875 --> 31:57.996
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think of the new controller?

31:59.297 --> 32:12.723
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's very innovative, it's fresh, and it's nice because after the Wii, which was very innovative and brought something new, I think this controller is a follow-up, and it's really nice.

32:12.923 --> 32:13.243
[SPEAKER_12]: Can't wait.

32:13.944 --> 32:17.085
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think that the Wii U is going to do to the Neo Geo's market share?

32:17.865 --> 32:18.286
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, wow.

32:18.966 --> 32:19.966
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have an idea.

32:20.426 --> 32:25.849
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope it's going to keep the leadership that the Wii brought.

32:25.869 --> 32:26.569
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

32:27.770 --> 32:28.030
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

32:29.454 --> 32:30.535
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Kim.

32:31.195 --> 32:31.615
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Kim.

32:32.396 --> 32:33.216
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think of the Wii U?

32:33.436 --> 32:34.437
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's amazing.

32:34.497 --> 32:35.657
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to play it.

32:35.717 --> 32:36.518
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so excited.

32:36.538 --> 32:38.359
[SPEAKER_06]: So what do you think of the new Wii U controller?

32:39.239 --> 32:40.220
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually very light.

32:40.240 --> 32:44.562
[SPEAKER_00]: I've played it before, so it's surprisingly light, and it's just amazing.

32:44.582 --> 32:45.903
[SPEAKER_00]: It brings the whole game to life.

32:46.843 --> 32:50.685
[SPEAKER_06]: So what do you think that the Wii U is going to do to the Sega Saturn's market share?

32:51.366 --> 32:52.046
[SPEAKER_00]: Sega Saturn?

32:52.587 --> 32:53.127
[SPEAKER_06]: Sega Saturn.

32:55.208 --> 32:58.510
[SPEAKER_06]: Panzer Dragoon, Virtua Fighter.

33:01.904 --> 33:02.344
[SPEAKER_01]: Your name, sir?

33:02.645 --> 33:03.245
[SPEAKER_01]: Carlos Rivera.

33:03.705 --> 33:05.327
[SPEAKER_06]: Carlos, what do you think of the Wii U?

33:05.947 --> 33:07.148
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm very excited about it.

33:07.568 --> 33:12.672
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been reading up on it since they announced it was going to come out, and that's why I'm here now, to get it.

33:12.692 --> 33:13.813
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent, excellent.

33:13.873 --> 33:14.894
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think of the new controller?

33:15.375 --> 33:16.555
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I love the tablet controller.

33:16.576 --> 33:18.977
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the fact that it's a tablet.

33:19.057 --> 33:22.660
[SPEAKER_01]: You can play the games on it, other than your screen.

33:23.061 --> 33:23.441
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.

33:24.506 --> 33:27.309
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think this is going to do to the Atari Jaguar's market share?

33:27.709 --> 33:31.573
[SPEAKER_06]: The Atari Jaguar has that 16, that numpad button controller.

33:32.754 --> 33:35.317
[SPEAKER_01]: Well... That was pretty innovative.

33:35.837 --> 33:40.702
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty innovative, but I, I mean, you know, I'm going to be looking into that too, of course.

33:41.511 --> 33:42.052
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent, excellent.

33:42.872 --> 33:46.935
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you think maybe that girl might have known what an N-Gage was?

33:47.016 --> 33:48.717
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe she should have checked on that market share.

33:48.757 --> 33:49.137
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

33:49.237 --> 33:51.199
[SPEAKER_15]: She's like, what's a Sega Saturn?

33:51.239 --> 33:51.679
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

33:52.300 --> 33:54.061
[SPEAKER_10]: That just makes me hurt in my heart.

33:56.283 --> 33:58.325
[SPEAKER_06]: Please, no one remember what the N-Gage was.

33:58.485 --> 34:02.868
[SPEAKER_15]: I love the people in the background going, Sega Saturn?

34:02.928 --> 34:04.029
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not in this.

34:04.109 --> 34:06.131
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to have an N-Gage.

34:06.869 --> 34:07.470
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I know.

34:07.911 --> 34:08.652
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we gave it away.

34:10.775 --> 34:19.968
[SPEAKER_15]: So, Loki, I thought I saw you kind of twitching over there a little bit when they were asking about the tablets and some of the people were like kind of giving the same answer.

34:20.048 --> 34:22.692
[SPEAKER_15]: So innovative, so different, so new, so fresh.

34:23.032 --> 34:24.633
[SPEAKER_13]: That's no, that's not an answer.

34:24.673 --> 34:25.874
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just like a canned answer.

34:26.534 --> 34:27.855
[SPEAKER_13]: That is literally right there.

34:27.915 --> 34:29.176
[SPEAKER_13]: That is subliminal advertising.

34:29.216 --> 34:34.218
[SPEAKER_13]: That's from basically, they keep hearing it repeated to them that this is so innovative and stuff.

34:34.859 --> 34:38.141
[SPEAKER_13]: And then they go and say, oh yeah, it's so innovative.

34:38.201 --> 34:39.221
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what they tell their friends.

34:39.521 --> 34:42.123
[SPEAKER_13]: What is so fucking innovative about this tablet?

34:42.303 --> 34:45.265
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, it's a tablet that exists pretty much on everything right now.

34:45.285 --> 34:47.146
[SPEAKER_15]: It is a shit ton better than smart glass, I'll tell you that.

34:47.646 --> 34:51.809
[SPEAKER_15]: I said smart glasses, nothing more than a fancy Wi-Fi remote for the 360, that's all it is

35:14.188 --> 35:34.421
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, well, before we get into that So, the tablet's all it is is on live for the Wii Fair enough Well, not really, I mean, the big difference that you'll see with the Wii I think it's a huge difference too, but anyway It's just low latency, that's all It's latency, it's low latency Anyhow, alright, let's talk about some of these other interviews Who else did you talk to while you were there at the show?

35:35.305 --> 35:51.809
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, while we were discussing the whole market share quip, we came across this one guy named Nick who does charity for one of his closest friends because they were on the line for the Wii, but unfortunately his friend passed away from leukemia, so they do a chocolate charity in his honor every year.

35:51.969 --> 35:52.550
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's cool.

35:53.310 --> 35:53.990
[SPEAKER_15]: I like that.

35:54.030 --> 35:54.730
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's hear from this guy.

35:55.350 --> 35:55.950
[SPEAKER_06]: We found this man.

35:56.010 --> 35:56.631
[SPEAKER_06]: Your name again, sir?

35:57.071 --> 35:58.031
[SPEAKER_20]: My name is James Brief.

35:58.860 --> 36:05.006
[SPEAKER_06]: James, do you have any particular connection to the Wii and Wii launch dates?

36:06.047 --> 36:17.297
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, actually, my friends and I, years ago, were in the same line waiting for the Wii, and one of our friends, Nicholas Capobianco, since then, he passed away from leukemia.

36:18.478 --> 36:31.785
[SPEAKER_20]: and every year since then, our friends, we get together like we did in the old days and we have a gaming marathon where we play games weekend straight, stream it live on the net at nixmarathon.org and we raise money for a child's play.

36:32.285 --> 36:35.827
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a charity that raises money for pediatric hospitals.

36:36.407 --> 36:36.847
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

36:36.947 --> 36:41.329
[SPEAKER_06]: Very reminiscent of Loading Ready Run's Desert Bus for Hope.

36:42.030 --> 36:43.050
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that's very cool.

36:43.891 --> 36:44.131
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

36:44.787 --> 36:46.808
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any other comments about the Wii U?

36:47.268 --> 36:48.269
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, looking forward to it.

36:48.729 --> 36:51.330
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think this is going to do to the GameCube's market share?

36:52.251 --> 36:54.112
[SPEAKER_20]: I think connectivity is on its way back.

36:54.672 --> 36:55.112
[SPEAKER_06]: Fabulous.

36:56.152 --> 36:57.573
[SPEAKER_15]: The connectivity is on its way back.

36:57.793 --> 36:59.254
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that's a very noble cause.

36:59.354 --> 37:00.435
[SPEAKER_15]: That's actually really awesome.

37:00.575 --> 37:02.556
[SPEAKER_15]: So props to that guy.

37:02.576 --> 37:03.096
[SPEAKER_15]: That's great.

37:03.176 --> 37:04.416
[SPEAKER_15]: And the group of friends that do that.

37:04.477 --> 37:08.659
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope if I inevitably leave this world too soon, y'all will do something similar.

37:08.699 --> 37:09.299
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's great.

37:09.983 --> 37:11.164
[SPEAKER_04]: You know we will because we love you.

37:11.284 --> 37:14.446
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll totally start a charity to get me game systems.

37:15.206 --> 37:15.607
[SPEAKER_13]: Stop.

37:15.767 --> 37:16.187
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

37:17.168 --> 37:18.008
[SPEAKER_15]: Moving on.

37:18.529 --> 37:20.110
[SPEAKER_15]: Who else did you guys talk to?

37:21.030 --> 37:24.692
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the next clip I called Wii U Gets Grilled Cheese Sandwiches.

37:25.213 --> 37:30.316
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems that the staff was handing out drinks, food, to everybody that's online.

37:30.516 --> 37:37.541
[SPEAKER_04]: So as we were interviewing this one parent that's on the line for Wii U, staffer comes by, hands us grilled cheese sandwiches.

37:37.721 --> 37:38.561
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're like, why not?

37:38.581 --> 37:39.182
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's roll with it.

37:39.949 --> 37:40.890
[SPEAKER_15]: Heck yeah, let's hear this.

37:41.912 --> 37:43.154
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, DJ Ranma S here.

37:43.374 --> 37:49.943
[SPEAKER_04]: We are live, well, sort of live, outside of Nintendo World with the thousands and thousands of the Nintendo's fans.

37:51.670 --> 37:52.450
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you hear that?

37:52.651 --> 37:55.272
[SPEAKER_04]: These people are psyched for a Wii U and you know what?

37:56.453 --> 37:58.614
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wii U makes some real good grilled cheese sandwiches.

37:58.634 --> 37:59.014
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.

37:59.354 --> 37:59.795
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.

38:00.455 --> 38:00.915
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.

38:01.315 --> 38:04.277
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wii U makes really good grilled cheese sandwiches.

38:04.297 --> 38:07.959
[SPEAKER_04]: Something that the PS3 could not do, that damn George Foreman grill.

38:08.419 --> 38:13.943
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, we're talking to some people out here about their thoughts about the Wii U and how long have you been on the line for this console?

38:14.523 --> 38:16.144
[SPEAKER_09]: Since about 2 o'clock this afternoon.

38:16.764 --> 38:20.206
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, so you decided not to come out here on a Monday or Tuesday and be like, I'm number one?

38:20.326 --> 38:25.128
[SPEAKER_09]: I did have to work, but somebody has to pay for the Wii U. True, but do you have kids?

38:25.348 --> 38:25.548
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

38:26.489 --> 38:28.350
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you think about sending the kids out here to hold the spot?

38:28.570 --> 38:30.991
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody has to go to school.

38:31.011 --> 38:32.492
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's a will, there is a way.

38:32.732 --> 38:36.614
[SPEAKER_04]: So tell me, is this the first time you are online for a game or a console like this?

38:36.714 --> 38:36.934
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

38:37.614 --> 38:38.835
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you out here for this?

38:39.175 --> 38:39.615
[SPEAKER_02]: Right here.

38:40.536 --> 38:42.457
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I just wanted to see how crowded it would be.

38:44.058 --> 38:44.638
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can...

38:46.656 --> 38:48.778
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you can see, it is very crowded.

38:48.798 --> 38:50.339
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a thinned out version.

38:50.659 --> 38:53.641
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you know, Christmas is right around the corner.

38:53.721 --> 38:58.345
[SPEAKER_04]: So how much pressure are you under to get this console under the tree?

38:58.905 --> 38:59.826
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, a lot of pressure.

39:00.206 --> 39:00.846
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of pressure.

39:00.886 --> 39:02.508
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm always under pressure every Christmas.

39:02.728 --> 39:03.769
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd set it up today.

39:04.629 --> 39:05.030
[SPEAKER_04]: Today?

39:05.330 --> 39:07.611
Yeah, I don't care if I get back at like midnight.

39:07.631 --> 39:08.272
I don't care.

39:08.852 --> 39:10.874
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I remember when the Super Nintendo came out.

39:11.294 --> 39:14.917
[SPEAKER_04]: I played it and I was told, pack it up, put it back in the box and put it back under the tree.

39:15.097 --> 39:16.098
[SPEAKER_09]: It would go back under the tree.

39:17.881 --> 39:20.782
[SPEAKER_04]: What have you just wrapped the empty... There you go!

39:21.122 --> 39:23.622
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you thought about just wrapping just the empty box under the tree?

39:24.363 --> 39:25.023
[SPEAKER_02]: It could work.

39:25.763 --> 39:29.364
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would be a good thing, so what games are you planning on getting out of here with?

39:29.744 --> 39:31.044
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, just Nintendo Land.

39:31.084 --> 39:34.665
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm waiting for some of the other games to come out towards the end of this year.

39:35.085 --> 39:36.626
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to buy a new Super Mario Bros.

39:36.906 --> 39:39.447
[SPEAKER_02]: 2, Zombie U, maybe a little later after launch.

39:40.467 --> 39:42.587
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, that sounds like a plan, so thanks a lot for your time!

39:43.147 --> 39:44.108
Arigato gozaimasu!

39:44.288 --> 39:44.988
[SPEAKER_04]: Datashimashite!

39:45.515 --> 39:47.156
[SPEAKER_15]: I was a very excited family.

39:48.577 --> 39:49.378
[SPEAKER_15]: Did I hear her right?

39:49.418 --> 39:50.879
[SPEAKER_15]: They set up the tree already?

39:51.720 --> 39:53.541
[SPEAKER_04]: The tree is set up around the corner.

39:53.561 --> 39:56.243
[SPEAKER_04]: The lighting ceremony is like sometime this or next week.

39:56.263 --> 39:57.744
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, the Rockefeller tree.

39:57.944 --> 39:58.785
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, right, right.

39:58.825 --> 39:59.345
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:59.365 --> 40:00.946
[SPEAKER_15]: They usually do that over the Thanksgiving weekend.

40:00.986 --> 40:01.707
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, I gotcha.

40:01.867 --> 40:02.287
[SPEAKER_15]: I gotcha.

40:02.607 --> 40:03.808
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, so what's this next one you got?

40:04.529 --> 40:11.574
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Link was online, so I had to ask him what his thoughts were, and did Zelda know that he left the castle?

40:13.004 --> 40:17.845
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, DJ Ranma S here at Rockefeller Center right in front of Nintendo World.

40:18.725 --> 40:19.406
[SPEAKER_04]: Take a look at that.

40:19.546 --> 40:21.066
[SPEAKER_04]: That is an awesome view, ain't it?

40:22.726 --> 40:23.187
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.

40:23.787 --> 40:24.227
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.

40:24.627 --> 40:26.967
[SPEAKER_04]: Right here, I'm chilling out with Link from Hyrule.

40:27.147 --> 40:28.108
[SPEAKER_19]: Link, what's going on, brother?

40:28.368 --> 40:34.149
[SPEAKER_19]: Just hanging out with my fellow diehard Nintendo fans and enjoying the night and having a good time.

40:34.649 --> 40:36.570
[SPEAKER_19]: So what brings you here tonight, good friend?

40:36.990 --> 40:37.990
[SPEAKER_19]: Wii U, obviously.

40:38.910 --> 40:41.131
[SPEAKER_19]: What about the Wii U that you want so bad?

40:41.974 --> 40:43.895
[SPEAKER_19]: because Nintendo, man.

40:44.115 --> 40:45.396
[SPEAKER_19]: That's all I got to say.

40:45.416 --> 40:46.476
[SPEAKER_19]: Nintendo's the short answer.

40:46.857 --> 40:52.860
[SPEAKER_19]: The long answer is I'm really excited about the new innovation that Nintendo's brought out with the new tablet controller.

40:54.521 --> 40:58.783
[SPEAKER_19]: They always set the bar with everything that they do, every generation.

40:59.623 --> 41:06.827
[SPEAKER_19]: They were the first for the joystick, the first for the shoulder buttons, the first for the rumble feature, the first for the motion, now they're the first for the touchscreen controller.

41:08.028 --> 41:09.749
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's just what they do, and they do it best.

41:10.762 --> 41:13.624
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, this brother, he's die hard, really die hard.

41:13.784 --> 41:22.489
[SPEAKER_04]: So Link, let me ask you, if you're here online for the Wii U, who's watching Zelda?

41:24.290 --> 41:25.110
[SPEAKER_19]: That's an excellent question.

41:26.311 --> 41:29.273
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing, does she even know that you left the castle to be here?

41:29.393 --> 41:31.594
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I snuck out for a couple days, actually, yeah.

41:33.526 --> 41:38.467
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I hope that Ganon doesn't try to roll up on your property, man.

41:38.487 --> 41:40.348
[SPEAKER_19]: She has Sheik watching her, so she'll be alright.

41:41.068 --> 41:42.788
[SPEAKER_19]: Sheik's a tough mother, you know.

41:44.328 --> 41:46.649
[SPEAKER_19]: So, Sheik is watching Zelda.

41:46.669 --> 41:47.369
[SPEAKER_19]: Not Sheik, I'm sorry.

41:47.789 --> 41:48.049
[SPEAKER_19]: Impa.

41:48.209 --> 41:50.590
[SPEAKER_19]: Zelda is Sheik.

41:50.670 --> 41:51.190
[SPEAKER_19]: I made a mistake.

41:51.850 --> 41:52.410
[SPEAKER_19]: Impa's watching.

41:52.490 --> 41:54.771
[SPEAKER_04]: An old woman is watching Zelda.

41:55.191 --> 41:56.111
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, she's a Sheikah.

41:58.356 --> 42:01.144
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you can't beat that kind of logic, so thank you, good sir.

42:01.224 --> 42:01.906
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

42:02.347 --> 42:03.109
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much.

42:03.390 --> 42:03.891
[SPEAKER_19]: No problem.

42:04.537 --> 42:10.040
[SPEAKER_15]: So Loki, I know that guy, you know, at first I was like, oh, he's just another kind of blind Nintendo fanboy.

42:10.120 --> 42:12.701
[SPEAKER_15]: However, he made a pretty damn good point.

42:12.821 --> 42:15.862
[SPEAKER_15]: Nintendo tends to set the bar with a lot of their shit.

42:16.223 --> 42:17.823
[SPEAKER_15]: I know you were sitting there going joystick.

42:17.863 --> 42:19.924
[SPEAKER_15]: They didn't do the joystick, but they did.

42:20.245 --> 42:23.466
[SPEAKER_15]: You can say that Nintendo set the bar for the modern gamepad.

42:23.866 --> 42:25.987
[SPEAKER_15]: The Kinect would have never happened if it wasn't for the Wii.

42:26.467 --> 42:26.808
[SPEAKER_15]: Thoughts?

42:27.789 --> 42:28.892
[SPEAKER_13]: The Kinect would have happened.

42:29.535 --> 42:31.200
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's camera technology.

42:31.521 --> 42:34.331
[SPEAKER_13]: The Kinect wouldn't have happened if the eye toy hadn't happened.

42:36.021 --> 42:38.743
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I just think that they should have stuck with the Coleco's model.

42:40.564 --> 42:43.266
[SPEAKER_15]: I miss my Intellivision pad.

42:43.566 --> 42:47.929
[SPEAKER_15]: Is the Coleco the one where you put the plastic stuff on the TV?

42:48.049 --> 42:49.089
[SPEAKER_15]: Or is it the Fairchild?

42:49.109 --> 42:50.430
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you didn't put it on the TV.

42:50.470 --> 42:52.211
[SPEAKER_07]: You slid a little thing into the number pad.

42:52.591 --> 42:55.053
[SPEAKER_15]: What was the thing that you would actually have to put the overlays on the television?

42:55.153 --> 42:56.514
[SPEAKER_15]: Was that the Fairchild?

42:56.594 --> 42:57.014
[SPEAKER_00]: Odyssey.

42:57.294 --> 42:57.715
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

42:58.255 --> 43:04.499
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, actually the Odyssey 2, though, didn't have... I had a couple games that used that, but not many that did.

43:04.719 --> 43:05.159
[SPEAKER_15]: I like Odyssey, too.

43:34.690 --> 43:35.210
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I was.

43:35.330 --> 43:37.091
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, so this is Mario and Black Luigi.

43:37.131 --> 43:37.471
[SPEAKER_15]: Here we go.

43:38.472 --> 43:39.472
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm doing a commentary.

43:39.632 --> 43:40.553
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you doing, Luigi?

43:41.313 --> 43:42.633
[SPEAKER_08]: I was also doing the commentary.

43:42.894 --> 43:43.854
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are you not in your mansion?

43:43.994 --> 43:45.655
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to get scared by the ghosts.

43:46.815 --> 43:49.136
[SPEAKER_08]: You should be off chasing after Peach again.

43:49.376 --> 43:50.057
[SPEAKER_08]: I need a break.

43:50.197 --> 43:51.297
[SPEAKER_08]: I always chase after Peach.

43:51.457 --> 43:52.658
[SPEAKER_08]: Peach never gives me nothing.

43:53.098 --> 43:53.758
[SPEAKER_08]: I need a break.

43:54.199 --> 43:55.899
[SPEAKER_08]: So is that why she ran off with Bowser again?

43:57.600 --> 43:59.101
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't you go screwing this thing over.

43:59.421 --> 44:00.281
[SPEAKER_08]: Bowser will take her.

44:00.661 --> 44:01.522
[SPEAKER_08]: She won't take Bowser.

44:03.240 --> 44:04.301
[SPEAKER_08]: So how's that the my fault?

44:04.501 --> 44:05.341
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not the other fault.

44:05.361 --> 44:07.522
[SPEAKER_08]: You get out of here.

44:07.803 --> 44:08.283
[SPEAKER_10]: Aww.

44:10.284 --> 44:12.926
[SPEAKER_15]: Ranma, you know I love you, but you're the biggest goddamn nerd.

44:13.706 --> 44:13.966
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

44:14.226 --> 44:14.767
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I know.

44:15.347 --> 44:15.587
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

44:16.027 --> 44:16.348
[SPEAKER_04]: You too.

44:16.668 --> 44:17.748
[SPEAKER_04]: What's this next one?

44:18.829 --> 44:25.233
[SPEAKER_04]: This one was Taiki's idea of talking to Mario about the financial crisis in the Mushroom Kingdom.

44:25.733 --> 44:25.853
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

44:27.034 --> 44:29.075
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the Mushroom Kingdom about to go off a fiscal cliff?

44:44.116 --> 44:44.456
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

44:44.877 --> 44:48.941
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's hear it.

44:49.001 --> 44:51.403
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sorry, I was playing the interview over you.

44:51.463 --> 44:51.763
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

44:52.984 --> 44:55.827
[SPEAKER_06]: With the funny physics in the Mushroom Kingdom, I don't know if that's possible.

44:56.888 --> 44:57.869
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's hear the clip.

44:59.372 --> 45:00.733
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Taiki with the voice of Greeks.

45:02.774 --> 45:06.055
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is for a special report, the financial crisis in the Mushroom Kingdom.

45:06.655 --> 45:07.356
[SPEAKER_06]: I have Mario here.

45:07.816 --> 45:10.637
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario, I've been told you've been tasked to collect a million coins.

45:11.657 --> 45:14.899
[SPEAKER_06]: What are your thoughts on the current financial status in the Mushroom Kingdom?

45:15.393 --> 45:19.376
[SPEAKER_08]: So the rumors that they are foreclosing on the castle at the Mushroom Kingdom is true.

45:44.506 --> 45:45.187
[SPEAKER_08]: What rumors?

45:45.447 --> 45:46.187
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't hear nothing.

45:46.307 --> 45:47.128
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just at the beach.

45:47.929 --> 45:48.969
[SPEAKER_06]: Sir, you're avoiding the question.

45:49.630 --> 45:50.210
[SPEAKER_08]: What question?

45:51.711 --> 45:52.972
[SPEAKER_08]: You look a lot like a Koopa.

45:53.873 --> 45:55.074
[SPEAKER_08]: Want I to stop you?

45:55.834 --> 45:57.055
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm just asking questions, sir.

45:57.936 --> 45:58.757
[SPEAKER_06]: Just asking questions.

45:59.077 --> 46:05.141
[SPEAKER_06]: So what are your thoughts on the overabundance of stars and how that's affected the stock market?

46:06.602 --> 46:07.723
[SPEAKER_08]: Overabundance of stars?

46:08.404 --> 46:09.545
[SPEAKER_08]: Make Mario invincible?

46:10.025 --> 46:10.946
[SPEAKER_08]: Invincible Mario kick ass?

46:15.602 --> 46:17.663
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a massive price crash on stars.

46:19.804 --> 46:20.824
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I see, I see.

46:22.104 --> 46:23.645
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario doesn't understand economics, does he?

46:24.205 --> 46:25.385
[SPEAKER_08]: Not very much, no.

46:26.306 --> 46:28.926
[SPEAKER_08]: I kick, I stomp on the goombas, I kick at the koopas.

46:29.346 --> 46:33.307
[SPEAKER_08]: I beat at the buzzer, I collect the coins, I no get a nothing from a peach.

46:34.528 --> 46:35.108
[SPEAKER_08]: Not even cake?

46:35.568 --> 46:36.448
[SPEAKER_08]: Not even cake.

46:37.609 --> 46:38.409
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, woe is on me.

46:39.918 --> 46:44.000
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was Taiki, Voice of Geeks Network, signing off.

47:04.624 --> 47:09.566
[SPEAKER_15]: So did you guys get on some of the news stations dressed up or what?

47:09.706 --> 47:10.147
[SPEAKER_15]: What happened?

47:11.447 --> 47:16.109
[SPEAKER_04]: Me, not really because the only people I saw there was people from Nintendo.

47:16.129 --> 47:16.849
[SPEAKER_04]: That was just about it.

47:16.889 --> 47:21.971
[SPEAKER_04]: But there was photographers and someone from Weekly Famitsu took my picture.

47:22.532 --> 47:22.912
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hey.

47:23.212 --> 47:23.552
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

47:24.252 --> 47:25.513
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mashable was there as well.

47:26.380 --> 47:26.800
[SPEAKER_06]: Yomiuri Shimbun

47:45.585 --> 47:52.467
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess it tends to happen more with Nintendo than it does the other companies because it seems like PlayStation and Vita and all that were out way earlier.

47:52.527 --> 47:55.087
[SPEAKER_13]: I know the Xbox is always coming out earlier over in Japan.

47:55.107 --> 47:57.248
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, Xbox makes a stud in Japan.

47:57.288 --> 47:57.548
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

47:57.808 --> 47:59.668
[SPEAKER_13]: Just they don't sell one for a few months.

47:59.688 --> 48:00.408
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, whatever.

48:00.488 --> 48:00.788
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

48:00.868 --> 48:04.909
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's get these last two interviews are some big ones.

48:05.169 --> 48:07.170
[SPEAKER_15]: So set this one up for us, Ranma.

48:07.190 --> 48:07.850
[SPEAKER_15]: What's next for us?

48:08.790 --> 48:20.568
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, at the front of the line was Triforce who says he was there on the line for about a month and he has some bit of surprising news to let the fans know about him doing console launches.

48:21.649 --> 48:22.511
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, okay, let's hear it.

48:23.959 --> 48:34.041
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, DJ Ranma S here in front of Nintendo World USA where in just mere hours the new Wii U is going to hit the store shelves and take names and kick a lot of butt.

48:34.341 --> 48:37.922
[SPEAKER_04]: Now as you can see behind me, there are diehard fans out here.

48:38.302 --> 48:39.782
[SPEAKER_04]: How diehard are you guys?

48:42.443 --> 48:43.483
[SPEAKER_04]: How long y'all been out here?

48:45.484 --> 48:51.105
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can see, but through the maze and through the vines, we're here with the one, the only, Triforce.

48:51.305 --> 48:52.245
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to meet you, sir.

48:52.998 --> 48:53.558
[SPEAKER_18]: What's going on guys?

48:54.038 --> 48:57.719
[SPEAKER_04]: Not much, we're doing what we gotta do, so tell me, how long have you been waiting out here?

48:58.660 --> 49:00.380
[SPEAKER_18]: Almost a month since March 23rd.

49:02.421 --> 49:07.482
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm dead serious, since March 23rd.

49:07.522 --> 49:09.883
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm still thinking about the 3DS since October 23rd.

49:11.703 --> 49:13.904
[SPEAKER_04]: October 23rd, now that's hard, that's dedication.

49:15.664 --> 49:17.285
[SPEAKER_04]: I tip my hat to you good sir.

49:18.655 --> 49:23.179
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I do recall that you were somewhere else for the Wii, is that correct?

49:23.459 --> 49:26.562
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, it was Toys R Us, and that was back in November.

49:26.762 --> 49:27.603
[SPEAKER_18]: I can remember that date.

49:28.143 --> 49:29.404
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, we all remember that.

49:29.465 --> 49:32.387
[SPEAKER_04]: So, why here instead of there?

49:32.627 --> 49:43.457
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought, well, first of all, this is my last launch that I'm going to be doing, and I took a guess, I did some investigating, and I just felt that they were going to do the launch here.

49:44.321 --> 49:46.203
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that's where it is, because you know what?

49:46.504 --> 49:52.051
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked to people about the Wii, and I kept telling everyone, Nintendo World is the jump-off spot, because this is where the party is at.

49:52.331 --> 49:54.934
[SPEAKER_04]: So, how many of these launch events have you done?

49:55.315 --> 49:56.957
[SPEAKER_18]: This is my eighth and final one.

49:57.698 --> 49:59.040
[SPEAKER_18]: Why is it your final one, good sir?

49:59.900 --> 50:07.842
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to go and try to do some type of other marketing in the gaming community from the urban market, from the grassroots side.

50:08.442 --> 50:14.023
[SPEAKER_18]: Although I do a lot of this, I want to leave this for somebody else to do while I can help out elsewhere.

50:14.643 --> 50:21.065
[SPEAKER_18]: I've done enough of it, and I'm 35 years old, so now's the time to stop.

50:21.345 --> 50:26.146
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not to say that I won't be at other launch parties, but the whole camping for the first, I'm going to stop it.

50:26.186 --> 50:26.606
[SPEAKER_18]: This is it.

50:27.276 --> 50:33.398
[SPEAKER_04]: So in other words, after this, you're going to take, someone else is going to inherit the Power Glove, but you now have the power.

50:33.418 --> 50:34.839
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they're going to have to fight you for it.

50:35.159 --> 50:36.440
[SPEAKER_18]: No, they're not getting that.

50:36.460 --> 50:38.160
[SPEAKER_18]: They're just going to have to line up.

50:38.901 --> 50:39.821
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm keeping the Power Glove.

50:40.421 --> 50:43.222
[SPEAKER_04]: Between you and me, I'd stomp somebody out for that to keep my Power Glove.

50:44.003 --> 50:45.503
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, that may happen, yeah.

50:45.723 --> 50:47.444
[SPEAKER_18]: So what was your first launch?

50:48.444 --> 50:49.585
[SPEAKER_18]: The Nintendo DS.

50:50.458 --> 50:52.780
[SPEAKER_18]: And how was that compared to the launch for the Wii U?

50:53.101 --> 50:55.183
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, each year Nintendo gets better with the launch.

50:55.203 --> 50:56.924
[SPEAKER_18]: That was all the way back in 2004.

50:57.285 --> 51:00.989
[SPEAKER_18]: And that was the first launch that I got first in.

51:01.049 --> 51:03.992
[SPEAKER_18]: My first ever launch was a Nintendo 64.

51:05.053 --> 51:09.017
[SPEAKER_18]: I wasn't first in line, but that's what made me get into the whole launch thing.

51:09.437 --> 51:11.659
[SPEAKER_18]: Then after that, some unmentionables.

51:11.699 --> 51:14.182
[SPEAKER_18]: I won't mention the name of the other competitors.

51:14.682 --> 51:16.363
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, those guys.

51:16.583 --> 51:18.064
[SPEAKER_18]: Those guys, yeah.

51:18.104 --> 51:21.486
[SPEAKER_18]: That's because I was working for GameStop, so I had to work the launch party.

51:21.886 --> 51:22.926
[SPEAKER_18]: So it wasn't as fun?

51:23.827 --> 51:25.608
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I wouldn't say it wasn't as fun.

51:25.988 --> 51:27.669
[SPEAKER_18]: I wasn't in the line for the launch.

51:27.709 --> 51:29.249
[SPEAKER_18]: I just worked the launch party.

51:29.830 --> 51:33.992
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the first launch party I became first for was the Nintendo DS.

51:35.339 --> 51:36.259
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

52:02.344 --> 52:03.385
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

52:20.451 --> 52:36.781
[SPEAKER_15]: it's like that line from Lethal Weapon I'm getting too old for this shit alright we got one more interview from the event and dare I say it's a Orange Lounge Radio VOG Network exclusive we're about to get

52:37.581 --> 52:48.608
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, and I've been teasing a little bit on Twitter that you had a pretty big interview, but it's short, but we wanted this to be special for the fans that actually bothered to tune in and listen tonight.

52:49.108 --> 52:50.829
[SPEAKER_15]: Ranma, please set up this last interview.

52:51.849 --> 52:54.211
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the man...

52:55.908 --> 52:59.069
[SPEAKER_04]: shows up, and we all know who the man is, Reggie.

52:59.690 --> 53:04.171
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going through the crowd, doing autographs, and saying hi to everyone.

53:04.612 --> 53:10.454
[SPEAKER_04]: And we catch him right before he goes inside Nintendo World, and me and Taiki ask him a couple of quick questions.

53:11.767 --> 53:14.509
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, you're going to have to set up the clip a little longer than that.

53:14.549 --> 53:17.151
[SPEAKER_15]: The live listeners literally just got dropped.

53:19.613 --> 53:20.253
[SPEAKER_15]: Word must have gone up.

53:20.273 --> 53:24.836
[SPEAKER_15]: But see, yes, Ranma, you're always the first to complain about the live stream going down.

53:24.876 --> 53:26.798
[SPEAKER_15]: And yet here we are still talking to each other.

53:26.898 --> 53:27.498
[SPEAKER_15]: Isn't that funny?

53:28.339 --> 53:28.999
[SPEAKER_15]: I know.

53:30.761 --> 53:31.061
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

53:31.261 --> 53:31.461
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

53:31.501 --> 53:36.805
[SPEAKER_15]: With the apologies to the podcast listeners who are hearing this for the second time, Ranma, go ahead and set it up one more time.

53:37.847 --> 53:38.768
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

53:57.998 --> 54:00.779
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, this is going to be really awkward, but the stream just went down again.

54:02.380 --> 54:05.081
[SPEAKER_15]: We were up for like two seconds, and then it went down.

54:05.501 --> 54:07.982
[SPEAKER_15]: I need you guys to kill all excess internet activity.

54:08.142 --> 54:08.882
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not doing anything.

54:08.942 --> 54:10.883
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just saying I need everybody across the board.

54:11.163 --> 54:15.665
[SPEAKER_15]: Any chat, I need it all closed, because this is killing the show with all these computers running.

54:16.185 --> 54:17.125
[SPEAKER_15]: So, all right.

54:17.185 --> 54:18.386
[SPEAKER_15]: Even my torrents of Shiza porn?

54:19.847 --> 54:21.227
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, any torrents of that stuff.

54:21.328 --> 54:23.529
[SPEAKER_15]: Any Dropbox that might be hiding in the background or whatever.

54:23.569 --> 54:24.449
[SPEAKER_15]: It's got to all go down.

54:24.930 --> 54:25.570
[SPEAKER_15]: So, okay.

54:26.991 --> 54:27.831
[SPEAKER_15]: We are connected.

54:27.891 --> 54:28.432
[SPEAKER_15]: Here we go.

54:28.952 --> 54:30.153
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, podcast listeners.

54:30.193 --> 54:35.236
[SPEAKER_15]: I feel like Seacrest on American Idol where it's like I'm drawing it out for like two minutes, the big interview.

54:35.296 --> 54:37.377
[SPEAKER_15]: But please know it's for the live listeners' benefit.

54:37.757 --> 54:39.618
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I am showing it as streaming again.

54:40.018 --> 54:40.919
[SPEAKER_15]: So here we go.

54:41.459 --> 54:42.620
[SPEAKER_15]: The big interview with Reggie.

54:45.353 --> 54:45.934
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good.

54:45.974 --> 54:46.854
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll be here as well, right?

54:46.994 --> 54:47.515
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

54:47.535 --> 54:48.896
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody, how excited are you?

54:49.116 --> 54:49.716
[SPEAKER_05]: How excited?

54:49.776 --> 54:50.657
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very excited.

54:51.758 --> 54:52.478
[SPEAKER_05]: This is it, right?

54:52.658 --> 54:53.819
[SPEAKER_05]: This is it.

54:53.879 --> 54:56.141
[SPEAKER_05]: A new generation of gaming begins tonight.

54:57.321 --> 55:02.645
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your name?

55:02.705 --> 55:05.127
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that a British accent?

55:05.247 --> 55:05.487
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

55:05.967 --> 55:07.789
[SPEAKER_05]: Came all the way from the UK just to be here?

55:08.249 --> 55:09.750
[SPEAKER_05]: No, actually.

55:09.770 --> 55:10.250
[SPEAKER_05]: No, come on.

55:10.270 --> 55:10.911
[SPEAKER_05]: You could have played me.

55:10.951 --> 55:13.253
[SPEAKER_05]: You could have said, yes, came all the way here.

55:15.915 --> 55:22.504
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a small question.

55:22.564 --> 55:23.825
[SPEAKER_06]: Million Coins and New Super Mario 2.

55:23.865 --> 55:27.751
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any comments about the current economic crisis in Mushroom Kingdom?

55:29.144 --> 55:31.205
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Mario's just trying to do his part.

55:31.265 --> 55:32.406
[SPEAKER_05]: He's collecting coins.

55:32.606 --> 55:35.948
[SPEAKER_05]: He'll go back and spend them someday, but he's trying to help out.

55:35.968 --> 55:38.669
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be no fiscal cliff in the Mushroom Kingdom.

55:39.109 --> 55:39.990
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much!

55:40.010 --> 55:42.611
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you get it?

55:43.812 --> 55:47.714
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, so you have the chance to ask Reggie one thing.

55:52.105 --> 55:58.027
[SPEAKER_15]: and you chose to ask him how he feels about the fiscal cliff in the Mushroom Kingdom.

55:58.868 --> 56:03.630
[SPEAKER_04]: But you gotta admit that he actually picked up on it and rolled with it.

56:03.670 --> 56:05.831
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to give the man credit for that.

56:07.251 --> 56:09.452
[SPEAKER_15]: Orange Lounge Radio exclusive, everybody.

56:09.532 --> 56:13.834
[SPEAKER_15]: Reggie comments on the fiscal cliff in the Mushroom Kingdom.

56:14.794 --> 56:16.715
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that's pretty cool and all.

56:17.635 --> 56:21.617
[SPEAKER_13]: It's almost as good as me asking Jason Enos about In The Groove, but

56:22.429 --> 56:27.696
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure asking them about the financial crisis in a fictional video game is fucking awesome.

56:28.377 --> 56:29.538
[SPEAKER_13]: That's great use of time.

56:31.300 --> 56:34.785
[SPEAKER_06]: He's going to get into the media and he's going to answer all these questions about whatever.

56:34.805 --> 56:35.266
[SPEAKER_07]: To be fair,

56:37.008 --> 56:42.674
[SPEAKER_15]: To be fair, it will be a bumper, but to be fair, Loki, you know damn well it doesn't matter what they ask.

56:42.774 --> 56:44.856
[SPEAKER_15]: They would have got the same canned answer for anything.

56:44.916 --> 56:52.023
[SPEAKER_15]: So for them to throw him a curveball, I say you guys are the biggest fucking nerds, and I so appreciate that about you.

56:52.843 --> 56:53.184
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

56:55.769 --> 56:56.829
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that was brilliant.

56:58.710 --> 57:01.011
[SPEAKER_07]: I would rather have had that than the canned response.

57:01.311 --> 57:03.171
[SPEAKER_07]: If we want the canned response, we can look at press releases.

57:04.051 --> 57:06.232
[SPEAKER_13]: You press them for more, whatever.

57:06.552 --> 57:10.573
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and the whole five seconds before he goes, I gotta go inside, bye.

57:10.593 --> 57:11.994
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, Loki's jealous he wasn't there.

57:12.294 --> 57:14.174
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we're not 2020, so.

57:14.314 --> 57:18.835
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit differently, and also, you can thank Taiki, that was his idea, alright?

57:19.176 --> 57:20.716
[SPEAKER_04]: That went over damned well.

57:20.996 --> 57:26.980
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you both contributed a lot to that segment, and I really appreciate you guys sharing that with OLR first.

57:27.041 --> 57:30.243
[SPEAKER_15]: I know you could have held on to that for AJS, but I really appreciate that.

57:30.963 --> 57:32.364
[SPEAKER_15]: VOG podcast sticking together.

57:32.404 --> 57:32.885
[SPEAKER_15]: It's awesome.

57:33.846 --> 57:34.646
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, that's what we're here for.

57:34.666 --> 57:38.389
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, the band has one of the official VOG sheets.

57:39.159 --> 57:39.860
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice.

57:40.400 --> 57:41.061
[SPEAKER_15]: Very nice.

57:41.922 --> 57:45.045
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we're an hour into the show and we haven't even got to our gaming weeks yet.

57:45.106 --> 57:47.368
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm probably going to wrap this up so we can move on.

57:47.428 --> 57:49.330
[SPEAKER_15]: But you have anything else you guys want to get out?

57:49.370 --> 57:50.371
[SPEAKER_15]: Taiki, great job.

57:51.072 --> 57:53.014
[SPEAKER_15]: Anything you want to get out here before we let you go?

57:54.235 --> 57:56.598
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I talk about the issue of Quebec independence?

57:57.439 --> 57:57.959
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want.

57:58.780 --> 57:59.901
[SPEAKER_06]: Independence for Quebec now.

58:00.582 --> 58:01.123
[SPEAKER_06]: Viva Quebec.

58:02.783 --> 58:04.063
[SPEAKER_15]: Ramma, anything you want to get out?

58:04.483 --> 58:05.604
[SPEAKER_07]: They can succeed a little with Texas.

58:05.624 --> 58:07.984
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I think I should save it for calling back later.

58:08.004 --> 58:10.465
[SPEAKER_04]: It has something to do with Wii U's and ShameStop.

58:11.165 --> 58:11.645
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, boy.

58:11.765 --> 58:12.085
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

58:12.185 --> 58:13.345
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, hopefully talk to you later.

58:13.385 --> 58:15.506
[SPEAKER_15]: Hopefully you don't run too long tonight and I can take a lot of calls.

58:15.606 --> 58:15.886
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

58:16.246 --> 58:16.706
[SPEAKER_15]: No problem.

58:16.726 --> 58:17.166
[SPEAKER_15]: Take care, buddy.

58:17.566 --> 58:18.546
[SPEAKER_15]: And thanks, guys.

58:19.026 --> 58:19.387
[SPEAKER_15]: No problem.

58:20.147 --> 58:24.008
[SPEAKER_15]: You can hear Anime Jam Session Tuesdays at vognetwork.com, 630 Pacific, 930 Eastern.

58:28.447 --> 58:40.315
[SPEAKER_15]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com Use the passphrase, bronze Big thanks to them for being out there Even though their questions were a little bit lulzy You know what?

58:42.176 --> 58:49.241
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll take it Alright, moving on Let's get to our video game weeks And how was our gaming week?

58:49.281 --> 58:51.062
[SPEAKER_15]: It's only an hour into the show Loki!

58:52.363 --> 58:52.963
[SPEAKER_15]: How you doing?

58:53.163 --> 58:54.844
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh wait, I always start with Jamie How you doing?

58:54.884 --> 58:55.665
[SPEAKER_15]: How was your gaming week?

58:56.466 --> 58:58.149
[SPEAKER_15]: I already know what she's going to say.

58:58.169 --> 58:58.810
[SPEAKER_07]: It was sweet.

59:00.513 --> 59:01.254
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, what's that?

59:01.832 --> 59:06.254
[SPEAKER_07]: I played and beat Sugar Rush on the Wreck-It Ralph website.

59:07.255 --> 59:08.355
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fucking fun.

59:08.455 --> 59:10.136
[SPEAKER_07]: It needs to be like a for-reals game.

59:10.536 --> 59:16.799
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, and I was actually really surprised by how long it was, because I mean, I was playing for a few solid hours.

59:16.959 --> 59:27.424
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like you have four stages with three races in each stage, and like the first two, I think, are two laps, and then the third one is three laps, and then the last one's three laps.

59:28.045 --> 59:30.386
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's much longer and complex.

59:30.546 --> 59:30.646
[SPEAKER_07]: And

59:31.366 --> 59:40.454
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's like a stupid little kart racer, but it was really fun, and I've decided that Rancis is the best name ever, and my firstborn, if I have one, will be Rancis.

59:41.134 --> 59:44.057
[SPEAKER_07]: Rancis Flubberbuffer, whatever his name is.

59:44.657 --> 59:46.399
[SPEAKER_07]: The one with the Reese's Cup on his head.

59:47.419 --> 59:47.700
[SPEAKER_07]: And then...

59:49.804 --> 59:52.526
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I played a bunch of Mass Effect 2.

59:52.646 --> 59:53.646
[SPEAKER_07]: I played a bunch of it today.

59:54.206 --> 59:54.447
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

59:55.007 --> 59:56.848
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I actually did a whole bunch of design work.

59:57.048 --> 01:00:03.831
[SPEAKER_07]: But my design work had me going and pulling samples off of old video game packaging.

01:00:03.932 --> 01:00:05.332
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I wanted certain colors.

01:00:05.993 --> 01:00:08.014
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I pulled the gold off the Nintendo cartridge.

01:00:08.454 --> 01:00:09.474
[SPEAKER_07]: Off of the Zelda cartridge.

01:00:09.935 --> 01:00:10.055
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

01:00:10.615 --> 01:00:12.856
[SPEAKER_07]: because I wanted that particular shade.

01:00:13.136 --> 01:00:18.537
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's like when you sample part of it, it comes out kind of this muted brown.

01:00:19.578 --> 01:00:20.638
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was the color I wanted.

01:00:21.298 --> 01:00:23.499
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, what do I know that reflects that color?

01:00:23.539 --> 01:00:28.640
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was sampling NES cartridges to get the right shade of brown off of a gold Zelda cartridge.

01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:29.420
[SPEAKER_14]: Very cool.

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:34.982
[SPEAKER_07]: And I actually logged into WoW just because I don't want to get kicked out of the guild.

01:00:35.002 --> 01:00:35.662
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

01:00:36.375 --> 01:01:03.110
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate to say that but I mean I'm trying to build myself back up into actually wanting to level my troll it's just no one plays on Blade's Edge anymore and that's the only character I have I really care about is my main on there Ragenator at live.vognetwork.com expressing surprise DarkSakura won't name her firstborn Garrus WTF no Rancis no actually I'm probably never going to have a kid so it doesn't matter oh no

01:01:03.579 --> 01:01:04.599
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm serious.

01:01:04.819 --> 01:01:06.520
[SPEAKER_07]: At this point, I'm perfectly content with it.

01:01:06.900 --> 01:01:09.321
[SPEAKER_07]: All you people who have kids, good luck.

01:01:09.381 --> 01:01:09.761
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

01:01:09.781 --> 01:01:11.442
[SPEAKER_15]: You will have a new kitty to name someday.

01:01:11.502 --> 01:01:13.122
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a very similar dilemma.

01:01:13.323 --> 01:01:14.763
[SPEAKER_07]: I need a cat in my life right now.

01:01:15.763 --> 01:01:18.745
[SPEAKER_07]: But Dan's like, we have to buy a house first.

01:01:19.525 --> 01:01:20.465
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm like, well, fine.

01:01:20.505 --> 01:01:21.886
[SPEAKER_07]: If I can buy a house, I can get a cat.

01:01:21.986 --> 01:01:24.487
[SPEAKER_15]: For the cat, because the cat needs the house.

01:01:24.527 --> 01:01:25.207
[SPEAKER_15]: It won't be your house.

01:01:25.247 --> 01:01:26.047
[SPEAKER_15]: It'll be the cat's house.

01:01:26.267 --> 01:01:29.048
[SPEAKER_07]: I've decided that when I get a cat, it's going to be named Mochi.

01:01:29.448 --> 01:01:29.829
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.

01:01:29.969 --> 01:01:30.849
[SPEAKER_07]: My cat will be named Mochi.

01:01:31.269 --> 01:01:31.709
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a good name.

01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:35.491
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else for your gaming week?

01:01:35.751 --> 01:01:36.411
[SPEAKER_07]: Cooking with dog.

01:01:37.752 --> 01:01:38.573
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, no.

01:01:39.553 --> 01:01:44.775
[SPEAKER_07]: Going in between playing Mass Effect 2, pausing my game, making udon because I'm also watching cooking with dog.

01:01:45.516 --> 01:01:46.936
[SPEAKER_07]: And then going back and playing more Mass Effect.

01:01:46.956 --> 01:01:47.737
[SPEAKER_07]: That's been my cycle.

01:01:48.037 --> 01:01:49.738
[SPEAKER_07]: Mass Effect, cooking with dog, cooking.

01:01:50.258 --> 01:01:51.759
[SPEAKER_07]: Mass Effect, cooking with dog, cooking.

01:01:53.079 --> 01:01:54.280
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

01:01:55.172 --> 01:02:23.043
[SPEAKER_13]: I played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 Call of Duty Black Ops 2 because I'm really getting into the single player campaign tried some more of the multiplayer just kind of some system link stuff at work the rest we should be getting copies for everybody this week so we can play some of that and so far loved every minute of it hasn't let me down at all so I'm looking forward to that and I think I fit in a little bit of Minecraft this week as well

01:02:25.242 --> 01:02:26.383
[SPEAKER_13]: That's pretty much it.

01:02:27.123 --> 01:02:27.923
[SPEAKER_15]: Jason, how about you?

01:02:27.963 --> 01:02:29.304
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been a while since we've seen you last.

01:02:29.344 --> 01:02:30.584
[SPEAKER_15]: What's been going on in your gaming world?

01:02:30.785 --> 01:02:33.846
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, for that time frame... No, not that whole time frame.

01:02:34.846 --> 01:02:39.849
[SPEAKER_16]: I've actually been out here for work for a week at this point, just over a week.

01:02:40.709 --> 01:02:46.392
[SPEAKER_16]: So the literal week has been rather light because I've been having exciting San Francisco, California fun times.

01:02:46.872 --> 01:02:49.953
[SPEAKER_16]: But there is a setup at the office, and the office favorite is FIFA 13, so I've...

01:02:51.294 --> 01:02:55.677
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been thoroughly trashed at that game, both by the computer and by my coworkers.

01:02:55.837 --> 01:02:58.218
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that the one that they're hazing for being just like FIFA 12?

01:02:58.578 --> 01:03:00.379
[SPEAKER_16]: Isn't that all sports games in this generation?

01:03:00.399 --> 01:03:01.020
[SPEAKER_15]: That's on the Wii.

01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:03.661
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, like, for real, it is a carbon copy.

01:03:03.701 --> 01:03:05.222
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, I'm not, like, no joke.

01:03:05.242 --> 01:03:07.223
[SPEAKER_15]: That and Pro Evo are both carbon copies.

01:03:07.423 --> 01:03:15.608
[SPEAKER_16]: The last time I was out here, they did have FIFA 12, and the game, the only notable difference I've noticed is that they give you more interactivity during the loading screen.

01:03:16.108 --> 01:03:26.652
[SPEAKER_16]: But I completely admit that's completely superficial because I start a multiplayer game and go with it and I can't really comment to single player, you know, GM, those kind of bonus modes, anything like that.

01:03:26.692 --> 01:03:27.592
[SPEAKER_16]: I couldn't say at all.

01:03:28.712 --> 01:03:38.496
[SPEAKER_16]: They did also get Halo 4 and I started a campaign by myself on, I think the tier is easy, normal, legendary, heroic and I'm on legendary because I thought I could keep up.

01:03:39.977 --> 01:04:02.130
[SPEAKER_16]: uh no oh Dan made that mistake no I'm it might be passable with help you know a multiplayer legendary campaign but me by myself I'm still in chapter one and I gave up after playing the same checkpoint just past the same checkpoint about 30 40 times maybe more I'm not entirely sure I suck at Halo and I'm very very sad at this fact

01:04:04.364 --> 01:04:06.586
[SPEAKER_16]: Otherwise, yeah, that's really it.

01:04:06.867 --> 01:04:11.851
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm still nursing Borderlands 2 since I've been traveling quite a bit over these past two months.

01:04:12.612 --> 01:04:16.916
[SPEAKER_16]: And not really sit down and play meaningful games time lately, unfortunately.

01:04:17.897 --> 01:04:18.298
[SPEAKER_15]: Alrighty.

01:04:19.319 --> 01:04:25.605
[SPEAKER_15]: Most of my week I already talked about with the Wii U launch, so in the interest of time I'm not going to repeat myself, but I will talk about just quickly...

01:04:26.105 --> 01:04:33.171
[SPEAKER_15]: Played a little bit of Mass Effect 3 because we tried to set it up so that we have two TVs and two Xbox 360s here at the house.

01:04:33.551 --> 01:04:38.195
[SPEAKER_15]: So Alan and I were like, can we play multiplayer with each other even though we only have one copy of the game?

01:04:38.255 --> 01:04:42.058
[SPEAKER_15]: And we figured out yes we can because all of multiplayer is on both discs.

01:04:42.438 --> 01:04:56.447
[SPEAKER_15]: So we put one disc in one and one in the other and how we got around the online pass is I had Alan play on my usual Xbox and I played on the other one because when you have licensed content on the 360 it's licensed to the original console and your ID.

01:04:56.867 --> 01:05:05.252
[SPEAKER_15]: So we made it work and we played and Alan decided he hated it because having to go from keyboard and mouse to controller apparently not a good fit.

01:05:05.832 --> 01:05:13.981
[SPEAKER_15]: I also played some Halo 4, finished the first five episodes of Spartan Ops playing with a friend, so that was fun.

01:05:14.001 --> 01:05:16.304
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we actually did six, so that was cool.

01:05:16.824 --> 01:05:17.785
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, Halo, good times.

01:05:17.985 --> 01:05:19.107
[SPEAKER_16]: Emphasis on with a friend.

01:05:19.647 --> 01:05:22.630
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, and we play on, I think Spartan Ops we did normal.

01:05:23.328 --> 01:05:48.182
[SPEAKER_15]: you know so you know we don't we are not too crazy now all right uh some housekeeping for you guys please remember you can follow us on facebook facebook.com slash orange launch radio as well as twitter twitter.com slash olr meanwhile let's get into some news and a quick thank you to everybody voting in the podcast awards which are now closed thank you very much absolutely yes so thank you to everybody who voted for us in the podcast awards and if you didn't i hope you kept it indie

01:05:49.335 --> 01:06:15.053
[SPEAKER_15]: I forgot one more game oh hurry Fairy Solitaire oh I played that too thanks to that tip last week it's cute yeah it's free I can't complain better than Yaris all right let's get into some news Loki Rob having your head drilled open with your brains falling out is better than Yaris all right so there was a there was a system that launched today the Wii U and really I hadn't

01:06:18.519 --> 01:06:19.760
[SPEAKER_13]: I can see how you can be confused.

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:21.761
[SPEAKER_13]: It is very similar to the previous generation.

01:06:24.823 --> 01:06:28.665
[SPEAKER_13]: You may have been confused and bought another Wii, so you better double check that.

01:06:28.885 --> 01:06:29.966
[SPEAKER_07]: No, this one's black.

01:06:31.106 --> 01:06:32.167
[SPEAKER_13]: They do make black Wiis now.

01:06:35.329 --> 01:06:36.589
[SPEAKER_13]: So, let's see.

01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:40.192
[SPEAKER_13]: You know the difference between the Wii U and the Wiis.

01:06:40.252 --> 01:06:42.813
[SPEAKER_13]: The Wii has functioning online right now.

01:06:43.013 --> 01:06:43.814
[SPEAKER_13]: That's pretty sad.

01:06:45.242 --> 01:06:53.446
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, so the Wii they claim is going to be in larger supply, probably due to less demand, but it is going to be easily more available.

01:06:53.986 --> 01:07:12.314
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not going to make their artificial shortage as big this time around, but he says basically their second and third, fourth replenishments are going to be more frequent at holiday time, and you'll be able to get a Wii system or Wii U system before next year, or next holiday, I guess.

01:07:13.475 --> 01:07:15.236
[SPEAKER_13]: Which is good, I suppose.

01:07:17.477 --> 01:07:24.321
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, like with most Nintendo console launches of recent, it is missing a few things.

01:07:24.601 --> 01:07:37.009
[SPEAKER_13]: And the first being Nintendo's highly advertised and pimped out TV service, which was supposed to be launching with the console, but oh, you know, it's not done, so...

01:07:37.449 --> 01:07:45.516
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to be launching in December, and until then, you're at the wait to watch live TV through this, or your on-demand stuff, Netflix, etc.

01:07:46.577 --> 01:07:50.260
[SPEAKER_13]: So it'll be coming in the next few weeks, unless they delay it again, because that's something they do.

01:07:52.102 --> 01:07:54.023
[SPEAKER_13]: And then also, of course... Fun!

01:07:55.464 --> 01:07:56.886
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm kidding, it's a fun console.

01:07:57.466 --> 01:07:58.447
[SPEAKER_15]: It's an easy joke to make.

01:07:58.627 --> 01:07:59.888
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's a fun console.

01:08:00.948 --> 01:08:11.012
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm sure that everybody was really happy that waited in line to get their Wii U system to get home and download your 5GB firmware update, which is fantastic.

01:08:11.732 --> 01:08:16.654
[SPEAKER_13]: And, of course, this would also encompass the Miiverse stuff as well.

01:08:17.414 --> 01:08:26.578
[SPEAKER_13]: It's funny, though, because apparently there's some people that were having issues with it downloading so slow they thought their console was not working, so they shut it off

01:08:27.698 --> 01:08:48.702
[SPEAKER_13]: not a good idea and now their console doesn't work but uh yes five gigabytes so if you're thinking about it if you got that non-black system you have less than half of that storage space left for stuff obviously you're not going to put an actual game on there because there's no room for it but you're not going to be able to fit you know

01:08:49.782 --> 01:08:56.523
[SPEAKER_13]: You're going to basically need to get an external storage device, which is kind of... You kind of would have had to anyways, but still.

01:08:57.283 --> 01:08:58.164
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not as bad.

01:08:58.184 --> 01:09:02.724
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember when the Xbox 360 came out and everyone's like, Oh, hey, the 20 gig hard drives.

01:09:02.784 --> 01:09:02.985
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

01:09:04.605 --> 01:09:08.506
[SPEAKER_13]: 7 gigabytes of this is just the backwards compatibility data.

01:09:09.586 --> 01:09:10.626
[SPEAKER_13]: This is almost as bad.

01:09:11.406 --> 01:09:16.107
[SPEAKER_13]: Except they didn't have to wait an hour for the backwards compatibility data to exist on that hard drive.

01:09:17.589 --> 01:09:32.777
[SPEAKER_13]: and, um, of course, you know, with any network launch, this would be for MMOs and stuff, they've been having a little bit of issues, uh, it's been kind of up and down, probably because of the, you know, high traffic, but thankfully it is back up, so.

01:09:34.117 --> 01:09:34.597
[SPEAKER_13]: Fantastic.

01:09:34.677 --> 01:09:36.178
[SPEAKER_15]: It worked fine for me, for what it's worth.

01:09:36.418 --> 01:09:40.679
[SPEAKER_15]: To be fair, it did take an hour, but I expect that 5 gigs is going to take an hour to download.

01:09:41.159 --> 01:09:44.099
[SPEAKER_15]: But it did work fine, and I haven't really had connectivity problems.

01:09:45.579 --> 01:09:48.120
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Wii video chat was a little bumpy.

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:53.061
[SPEAKER_15]: We got some weird error messages that weren't even true, because we were able to connect fine.

01:09:53.081 --> 01:09:53.561
[SPEAKER_15]: It was weird.

01:09:54.101 --> 01:09:56.142
[SPEAKER_07]: Warning, the person on the other end does not exist.

01:09:57.202 --> 01:09:58.162
[SPEAKER_13]: Not quite that, but yeah.

01:10:01.124 --> 01:10:02.306
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

01:10:02.466 --> 01:10:04.508
[SPEAKER_13]: So, there's your Wii U launch.

01:10:05.409 --> 01:10:06.070
[SPEAKER_13]: Get excited.

01:10:07.091 --> 01:10:07.872
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm thrilled.

01:10:08.813 --> 01:10:09.133
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

01:10:09.674 --> 01:10:11.496
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, not too thrilled is this guy.

01:10:11.996 --> 01:10:13.298
[SPEAKER_15]: He got caught by the police.

01:10:14.392 --> 01:10:16.193
[SPEAKER_15]: Justin Success Brooks.

01:10:16.773 --> 01:10:18.474
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, his name was Success Brooks.

01:10:19.115 --> 01:10:29.341
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, unfortunately, he wasn't very successful in his business of selling counterfeit Nintendo games in the UK because he got caught and sentenced to 32 months of jail time.

01:10:29.881 --> 01:10:31.982
[SPEAKER_15]: He was actually selling counterfeited games.

01:10:32.382 --> 01:10:36.665
[SPEAKER_15]: He was working with some dealers in China through 18 different websites.

01:10:37.265 --> 01:10:59.101
[SPEAKER_15]: Nintendo had warned, the UK border agency had warned, he had his stock seized at one point however he continued to sell the games through a different website so it was kind of one of those, they weren't going to keep him out any other way so they officially sentenced him to 32 months although even in the UK you don't really end up serving the entire time he'll probably only be serving about half of it

01:11:00.754 --> 01:11:12.447
[SPEAKER_15]: What's interesting, Francesca Levitt, who is one of the prosecutors on this case, claiming the victim is not really Nintendo, but legitimate online game retailers who have to compete with counterfeit sellers.

01:11:12.968 --> 01:11:13.228
[SPEAKER_15]: Quote,

01:11:15.871 --> 01:11:44.086
[SPEAKER_16]: but the damage this has done to the reputation of online retailers is untold and incalculable that's in a statement to the Guardian I would take that down one last one more notch that not so much Evil G and those others but people who do like the use game stores or import game stores or the people who really try to carve out their niche that oh yeah they also sell big retail titles mainstream titles because you don't survive as a business any other way

01:11:45.538 --> 01:11:51.139
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it is a good reminder that this kind of stuff doesn't just hurt Nintendo.

01:11:51.179 --> 01:11:55.360
[SPEAKER_15]: It hurts everybody in the chain from developers and makers to the people that sell them.

01:11:56.501 --> 01:11:57.381
[SPEAKER_07]: It hurts my feelings.

01:11:58.121 --> 01:11:58.981
[SPEAKER_15]: And Jamie's feelings.

01:11:59.021 --> 01:12:00.341
[SPEAKER_07]: And it gives Reggie hemorrhoids.

01:12:01.182 --> 01:12:01.442
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

01:12:02.682 --> 01:12:03.542
[SPEAKER_07]: Because he's all butthurt.

01:12:04.082 --> 01:12:04.482
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I see.

01:12:05.183 --> 01:12:05.503
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

01:12:05.823 --> 01:12:07.463
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's move on with another story, DarkSakura.

01:12:08.503 --> 01:12:08.983
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

01:12:09.163 --> 01:12:11.324
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, who likes Pokemans?

01:12:12.025 --> 01:12:15.588
[SPEAKER_15]: Who doesn't like Pokemans?

01:12:15.888 --> 01:12:17.269
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course Loki raised his hand.

01:12:17.729 --> 01:12:26.815
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, actually Nintendo is doing Pokedex iOS, which is their first paid app in the Apple Store.

01:12:26.916 --> 01:12:29.117
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, it's only out in Japan right now.

01:12:29.958 --> 01:12:33.780
[SPEAKER_07]: And it covers everything up through black and white.

01:12:34.581 --> 01:12:37.423
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's 170 yen, which is about £1.30.

01:12:37.623 --> 01:12:40.405
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess here it would be maybe a $3 download.

01:12:41.986 --> 01:12:49.053
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, there's also extra packs with other monsters that, um, go up to, uh, 500 yen.

01:12:49.514 --> 01:12:52.597
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, yeah, you could pay a lot of money for it.

01:12:52.897 --> 01:13:03.808
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but now, uh, there's still, um, a free app that's the Pokemon Say Tap that was, uh, out for a little bit last year, but for right now, this is their first paid app.

01:13:04.505 --> 01:13:21.873
[SPEAKER_16]: I have to say that in some of it may be the language and I know that interfaces do vary highly in between languages but this Pokedex iOS looks kind of as crap as Pokedex 3D on the 3DS store.

01:13:22.074 --> 01:13:23.454
[SPEAKER_16]: I never liked it.

01:13:24.215 --> 01:13:33.019
[SPEAKER_16]: It may also be that I've kind of abandoned ship as far as Pokemon is concerned and I haven't played it recently enough so I didn't none of the creatures were familiar but this doesn't

01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:37.980
[SPEAKER_15]: I heard that this thing is full of in-game purchases, too.

01:13:38.241 --> 01:13:39.381
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, that's what I was saying.

01:13:39.901 --> 01:13:43.642
[SPEAKER_07]: There's four extra packs, and they're 500 yen total.

01:13:43.682 --> 01:13:44.342
[SPEAKER_15]: They ain't free.

01:13:44.883 --> 01:13:47.723
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I mean, you roughly end up paying about seven bucks.

01:13:48.464 --> 01:13:48.724
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

01:13:49.144 --> 01:13:49.764
[SPEAKER_07]: Six or seven.

01:13:51.164 --> 01:13:55.946
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to do a little bit of conversion here, but yeah, you end up paying more like about six bucks.

01:13:56.306 --> 01:13:58.827
[SPEAKER_15]: So Loki, you got to be excited about this.

01:13:58.907 --> 01:14:02.969
[SPEAKER_15]: It's Nintendo on an Apple product full of microtransactions.

01:14:03.029 --> 01:14:04.689
[SPEAKER_15]: This is like made for you.

01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:12.092
[SPEAKER_13]: It sounds like just any other app on the iOS, Apple Store or whatever.

01:14:13.433 --> 01:14:17.174
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's just what's interesting is it's not a knockoff for once.

01:14:18.075 --> 01:14:18.615
[SPEAKER_15]: This is true.

01:14:19.535 --> 01:14:22.537
[SPEAKER_15]: And plus the whole, oh my gosh, it's something Nintendo on Apple.

01:14:22.577 --> 01:14:30.202
[SPEAKER_15]: But before the emails correcting us come in, we should say there's a very different relationship when it comes to the Pokemon company.

01:14:30.622 --> 01:14:38.948
[SPEAKER_15]: Because even though Nintendo somewhat controls them at the end of the day, if the Pokemon company wants to do something different, they can.

01:14:39.288 --> 01:14:43.150
[SPEAKER_15]: And so for them to be the ones dipping their big toe in with this iOS app is not...

01:14:44.271 --> 01:14:45.452
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not too surprising.

01:14:45.472 --> 01:14:52.397
[SPEAKER_15]: And it could be interesting because if this does very well, which, who knows, maybe that will cause Nintendo?

01:14:52.517 --> 01:14:52.857
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

01:14:52.897 --> 01:15:02.504
[SPEAKER_15]: But then again, Nintendo's always been very much, no, ever since the CDI, never again will our characters be on another console.

01:15:03.305 --> 01:15:03.485
[SPEAKER_15]: So...

01:15:04.385 --> 01:15:07.226
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, moving on.

01:15:08.727 --> 01:15:09.027
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

01:15:09.547 --> 01:15:14.369
[SPEAKER_13]: So let's talk a little bit about non-Nintendo stuff.

01:15:14.910 --> 01:15:16.470
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's talk about Microsoft.

01:15:16.530 --> 01:15:21.332
[SPEAKER_13]: And of course, they were celebrating the 10-year anniversary of Xbox Live.

01:15:21.812 --> 01:15:32.977
[SPEAKER_13]: And with that, they were giving out some fancy Xbox Live 10-year anniversary themed Xbox 360s to people that had been on live for those 10 years.

01:15:34.451 --> 01:15:35.731
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, certain people didn't get them.

01:15:37.952 --> 01:15:38.452
[SPEAKER_13]: Like Bobby.

01:15:40.793 --> 01:15:41.273
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, Bobby.

01:15:42.173 --> 01:15:45.294
[SPEAKER_13]: But there's some random users were getting them.

01:15:45.374 --> 01:15:47.855
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think every 10-year user got one.

01:15:47.895 --> 01:15:52.736
[SPEAKER_15]: You probably got entered into a drawing or something behind the scenes and they gave away like 100 of them or something.

01:15:52.936 --> 01:15:54.056
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, they never really explained it.

01:15:54.556 --> 01:15:57.197
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't really make any sense to me that they would give you a console.

01:15:57.217 --> 01:16:01.138
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that's kind of cool that you get a console, but wouldn't you already have a console if you're on Xbox Live?

01:16:01.178 --> 01:16:02.779
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, hooray!

01:16:02.799 --> 01:16:03.219
[SPEAKER_13]: My red ringed.

01:16:04.119 --> 01:16:12.267
[SPEAKER_16]: All the people that won it are the people that have lived through about five or six Red Rings and E74s, so the next time it invariably happens to their next one, they have a replacement already.

01:16:13.648 --> 01:16:15.170
[SPEAKER_16]: And it looks pretty cool, actually.

01:16:15.501 --> 01:16:17.142
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

01:16:17.882 --> 01:16:20.443
[SPEAKER_13]: It's neat, I guess.

01:16:21.523 --> 01:16:29.146
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of you who may have been on there for 10 years will maybe get in an email or something saying, hey, you got a 360 coming your way.

01:16:29.186 --> 01:16:35.548
[SPEAKER_15]: You probably would have already got that email or you got the email that I got that says, congrats, here's your code for an avatar helmet.

01:16:36.408 --> 01:16:38.229
[SPEAKER_13]: I got an email and two messages.

01:16:38.249 --> 01:16:38.989
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

01:16:40.444 --> 01:16:42.008
[SPEAKER_15]: Take the fucking helmet, Loki.

01:16:42.269 --> 01:16:42.990
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want the helmet.

01:16:43.171 --> 01:16:43.472
[SPEAKER_15]: Take it.

01:16:43.652 --> 01:16:44.474
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not wearing the helmet.

01:16:44.594 --> 01:16:44.795
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

01:16:45.036 --> 01:16:45.276
[SPEAKER_15]: Take it.

01:16:45.296 --> 01:16:45.958
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's another message.

01:16:45.998 --> 01:16:46.660
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's another code.

01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:47.462
[SPEAKER_15]: Take the damn helmet.

01:16:47.482 --> 01:16:49.246
[SPEAKER_07]: It puts the helmet on its avatar.

01:16:53.391 --> 01:16:53.651
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice.

01:16:55.293 --> 01:17:02.859
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, speaking of Microsoft, this is interesting because we know the PlayStation magazine's stopping, the Nintendo Power's stopping.

01:17:02.919 --> 01:17:06.762
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Xbox World is also going to cease publishing in December.

01:17:07.222 --> 01:17:08.123
[SPEAKER_15]: But this is what's interesting.

01:17:08.143 --> 01:17:12.387
[SPEAKER_15]: This is one over in the UK, and the last issue is going out with a bang.

01:17:13.628 --> 01:17:21.114
[SPEAKER_15]: Details on the next Xbox, which they say is going the way of Apple and is going to be called simply Xbox.

01:17:23.835 --> 01:17:25.276
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki is shaking his head.

01:17:25.797 --> 01:17:26.057
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

01:17:26.617 --> 01:17:27.338
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just dumb.

01:17:28.038 --> 01:17:32.221
[SPEAKER_13]: And Sony's brand new TV called TV... It's called the new TV.

01:17:32.561 --> 01:17:37.085
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like... Thank you for not making it fucking confusing.

01:17:37.565 --> 01:17:39.587
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just gonna call it something else anyways.

01:17:39.747 --> 01:17:41.448
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just basically saying, hey, you know what?

01:17:41.768 --> 01:17:44.210
[SPEAKER_13]: We just didn't want to market a name that people are gonna make fun of.

01:17:44.230 --> 01:17:48.193
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just gonna market a name that we already had that people can make fun of or something.

01:17:48.253 --> 01:17:49.634
[SPEAKER_15]: To be fair, it's rumor.

01:17:49.734 --> 01:17:50.234
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't know.

01:17:50.314 --> 01:17:50.795
[SPEAKER_15]: But anyway...

01:17:51.315 --> 01:18:07.766
[SPEAKER_15]: 8 gigs of RAM, quad core processor, it will run Blu-ray discs, supposedly going to have in the future, like some type of future add-on would be a head-mounted augmented reality device, and there will also be a next generation Kinect, which I think we all see as kind of a duh.

01:18:08.706 --> 01:18:17.989
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyhow, in a statement, Xbox World Editor-in-Chief Dan Dawkins said, Xbox World has been at the cutting edge of Durango coverage for over 12 months.

01:18:18.410 --> 01:18:26.392
[SPEAKER_15]: Unless something really dramatic changes, everything we reveal in our penultimate issue will be revealed long before E3 in June.

01:18:26.432 --> 01:18:29.673
[SPEAKER_15]: That was in an interview with CVG overseas.

01:18:29.854 --> 01:18:34.015
[SPEAKER_13]: So basically they just recapped the original leaked rumor thing that, you know.

01:18:34.244 --> 01:18:34.924
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not going to be glasses.

01:18:34.944 --> 01:18:34.984
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

01:18:55.235 --> 01:18:57.900
[SPEAKER_15]: You'd get into a lot of accessibility issues with glasses.

01:18:58.561 --> 01:19:00.184
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why the projection thing made more sense.

01:19:00.204 --> 01:19:03.190
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why 3D TVs aren't popular because you have to buy the glasses.

01:19:03.310 --> 01:19:03.871
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a good point.

01:19:04.492 --> 01:19:05.354
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's just...

01:19:07.395 --> 01:19:07.775
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

01:19:08.096 --> 01:19:10.037
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just... No.

01:19:10.097 --> 01:19:16.563
[SPEAKER_15]: WhatUpG in chat says at live.vognetwork.com says Next E3 is supposed to be the coming out party for the PS4 slash 720.

01:19:17.564 --> 01:19:19.606
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, that's the assumption we're all making.

01:19:20.026 --> 01:19:23.289
[SPEAKER_15]: And it sounds like at least in Microsoft's case that'll be true.

01:19:23.869 --> 01:19:24.089
[SPEAKER_15]: But...

01:19:25.170 --> 01:19:27.391
[SPEAKER_15]: Why is this necessarily true for Sony?

01:19:27.871 --> 01:19:30.932
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there any indication that Sony is really going to debut this?

01:19:30.992 --> 01:19:32.912
[SPEAKER_15]: Or is this wishful thinking on the community's part?

01:19:32.992 --> 01:19:33.993
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's all wishful thinking.

01:19:34.033 --> 01:19:36.273
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think anyone's going to debut a system next year.

01:19:36.773 --> 01:19:38.754
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you think Microsoft's going to hold off too?

01:19:38.814 --> 01:19:40.935
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that the Wii is not going to do as well.

01:19:41.075 --> 01:19:44.156
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not going to take over the Xbox 360 and the PS3.

01:19:44.656 --> 01:19:45.436
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're just like, meh.

01:19:45.956 --> 01:19:46.897
[SPEAKER_13]: Why do we have to hurry?

01:19:47.397 --> 01:19:48.418
[SPEAKER_13]: There's really no hurry.

01:20:03.308 --> 01:20:03.769
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess.

01:20:03.789 --> 01:20:12.896
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, if you look at what they have slated so far, what Microsoft has announced, they only have first quarter next year that's been announced, or even the first half of next year.

01:20:13.416 --> 01:20:15.898
[SPEAKER_13]: And Sony's kind of similar.

01:20:15.979 --> 01:20:18.020
[SPEAKER_13]: They've got a few things that they've announced.

01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:19.862
[SPEAKER_13]: They've got about three or four titles.

01:20:20.302 --> 01:20:24.725
[SPEAKER_13]: Those could all be first half of next year, but they haven't really... I mean, it's a little early to now.

01:20:24.765 --> 01:20:26.747
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the second half because you want to have something for E3.

01:20:26.767 --> 01:20:30.529
[SPEAKER_15]: You think The Last Office and the... What's that other big one?

01:20:30.609 --> 01:20:34.372
[SPEAKER_15]: The one that keeps disappearing at various E3s.

01:20:34.772 --> 01:20:35.473
[SPEAKER_15]: The Last Guardian?

01:20:35.553 --> 01:20:36.553
[SPEAKER_15]: Last Guardian, thank you.

01:20:37.214 --> 01:20:39.856
[SPEAKER_15]: There's no way in hell Last Guardian's out before next holiday.

01:20:40.897 --> 01:20:42.338
[SPEAKER_15]: And then on top of that, you still have...

01:20:43.258 --> 01:20:46.623
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever happened to 13 Versus?

01:20:46.683 --> 01:20:47.684
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't know where that is.

01:20:47.704 --> 01:20:51.990
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, that's third party, but a lot of Final Fantasy fans care.

01:20:52.210 --> 01:20:57.377
[SPEAKER_15]: And like it or not, 14 Reborn, that ain't happened until at least summer next year.

01:20:58.888 --> 01:21:03.915
[SPEAKER_15]: So, we know there is stuff on the calendar up to the holiday, at least in Sony's department.

01:21:05.096 --> 01:21:06.318
[SPEAKER_15]: So, that's interesting.

01:21:06.678 --> 01:21:09.302
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I mean, that's not Sony, though, necessarily.

01:21:09.342 --> 01:21:10.723
[SPEAKER_13]: That's third-party companies.

01:21:10.763 --> 01:21:13.888
[SPEAKER_13]: And, obviously, you're going to have third parties, you know, putting out titles.

01:21:13.928 --> 01:21:17.092
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, Tomb Raider is supposed to be... Well, that's early part of next year, but...

01:21:18.152 --> 01:21:23.676
[SPEAKER_13]: You still have stuff coming out for a while on there because not everyone's going to pick up.

01:21:23.956 --> 01:21:24.856
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just like the Wii.

01:21:24.876 --> 01:21:26.297
[SPEAKER_13]: The Wii's still going to have some stuff coming out.

01:21:26.537 --> 01:21:29.339
[SPEAKER_13]: Not anything from Nintendo, but they're going to have a few things.

01:21:29.619 --> 01:21:31.520
[SPEAKER_15]: Interesting comment from TigerClaw in the chat room.

01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:32.440
[SPEAKER_15]: What about the Ouya?

01:21:32.781 --> 01:21:34.642
[SPEAKER_15]: You would also have to deal with that when it comes out.

01:21:34.722 --> 01:21:36.443
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, the Ouya's kind of its own little thing.

01:21:36.503 --> 01:21:42.066
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think any of the other guys are taking the Ouya seriously because the Ouya is such a grassroots homebrew thing.

01:21:43.046 --> 01:21:48.368
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, oh, that little basement, that kid's basement toy, I honestly think that's how they view it.

01:21:48.669 --> 01:21:52.170
[SPEAKER_15]: Because what's the Wii going to do for the gaming experience?

01:21:52.230 --> 01:21:54.791
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it really going to push the gaming experience further?

01:21:55.551 --> 01:21:57.052
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's just going to open up.

01:21:57.112 --> 01:21:59.693
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to be like the most indie-friendly thing you've ever seen.

01:21:59.893 --> 01:22:05.237
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just going to be kind of similar to like how Steam, I mean, because it's kind of the way Steam's trying to go too.

01:22:05.257 --> 01:22:22.470
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, they have the whole Steam Greenlight stuff to try and get your indie games on their marketplace, and then Steam Big Picture, so they kind of want to sell you a box, which they may eventually do, you know, they will eventually sell you a box that you can hook up to your TV and you just get all the Steam stuff with a controller and away you go, which would be fantastic.

01:22:22.570 --> 01:22:23.591
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have a problem with that, but...

01:22:24.151 --> 01:22:47.271
[SPEAKER_13]: I think OUYA is trying to do something similar to that where they have got the box that they sell you which is really tiny which is awesome and then of course all these games are going to be kind of exclusive to it because they're mobile games for the most part and you'll just have to see how it takes off I don't think it's going to be huge it's not going to all of a sudden just take over the Wii or anything like that it's not going to happen it'll be like a

01:22:47.691 --> 01:22:48.172
[SPEAKER_15]: Roku.

01:22:48.472 --> 01:22:51.975
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of people have them, but not everybody's talking about them.

01:22:52.276 --> 01:22:59.023
[SPEAKER_13]: Unless, you know, and it's obviously the Wii U doesn't have anything like this, but let's just say that, you know...

01:23:00.228 --> 01:23:08.031
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's just say that one day they decide, hey, you know what, we're going to make it so all these games that you buy from us, yeah, you can't trade them in anymore.

01:23:08.211 --> 01:23:12.272
[SPEAKER_13]: Or in the next consoles that come out, hey, by the way, all these games are going to be tied to your console.

01:23:12.693 --> 01:23:14.813
[SPEAKER_13]: Then something like that may be able to take off.

01:23:14.853 --> 01:23:18.875
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm seeing on Twitter that your Nintendo Network ID is tied to that console.

01:23:18.915 --> 01:23:19.715
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't move it.

01:23:20.095 --> 01:23:23.036
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, I'm seeing a lot of rage on Twitter about that.

01:23:23.236 --> 01:23:27.698
[SPEAKER_15]: I kind of think that's that whole, we just haven't built how to move it yet concept.

01:23:29.059 --> 01:23:33.364
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm giving Nintendo the benefit of the doubt that they just haven't freaking built that in yet.

01:23:33.729 --> 01:23:38.172
[SPEAKER_13]: Once again, reiterating what we've been saying for months now, they don't fucking get online.

01:23:38.372 --> 01:23:42.475
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, they have something that resembles online right now, but they still don't fucking understand it.

01:23:42.575 --> 01:23:45.757
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's a real... They're making it up as they go along.

01:23:45.797 --> 01:23:48.459
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a real bad... I mean, come on.

01:23:49.139 --> 01:24:02.188
[SPEAKER_13]: This is... How late into the game are we getting into an actual functioning online and you still haven't figured... I mean, this is... This is shit that they were fucking up years ago and now they're just... I don't know.

01:24:02.388 --> 01:24:03.569
[SPEAKER_13]: It's amateur shit.

01:24:05.095 --> 01:24:08.027
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us before we get to release dates?

01:24:08.672 --> 01:24:10.213
[SPEAKER_07]: I have stuff and things.

01:24:10.794 --> 01:24:14.476
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm sure people were interested in Black Ops 2.

01:24:15.117 --> 01:24:18.499
[SPEAKER_07]: Although when one of my friends posted about it as BO2, I was like, Body Odor 2?

01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:20.861
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's really about as much as I care about Black Ops.

01:24:21.201 --> 01:24:23.243
[SPEAKER_07]: But they did something really awesomely stupid.

01:24:24.304 --> 01:24:32.109
[SPEAKER_07]: On the installation disk, it has the data for Mass Effect 2 on it instead.

01:24:32.570 --> 01:24:34.191
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're getting a much better game.

01:24:36.755 --> 01:24:36.975
[SPEAKER_07]: Black Ops 2

01:24:50.376 --> 01:24:58.899
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, I heard something, and I don't know if this ended up being true or not, but I heard something about that this was being caused because these people actually already... Oh, it's PC copies, by the way.

01:24:59.220 --> 01:24:59.340
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:10.264
[SPEAKER_15]: These people already had Mass Effect 2 installed on their PCs, and Mass Effect 2 had the lock on some type of file extension that Call of Duty was also, or Black Ops was also trying to use.

01:25:10.624 --> 01:25:13.545
[SPEAKER_15]: And so when Black Ops would call up the file, Mass Effect was loading.

01:25:14.085 --> 01:25:16.947
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, it seems like it's only happening to people that already had Mass Effect 2.

01:25:18.047 --> 01:25:18.827
[SPEAKER_15]: At least that's what I'm hearing.

01:25:18.867 --> 01:25:21.328
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if that panned out or whatever, but I know that was from the newer score.

01:25:21.469 --> 01:25:23.850
[SPEAKER_07]: It happened specifically with the second installation disc.

01:25:24.770 --> 01:25:25.390
[SPEAKER_15]: That's weird.

01:25:25.650 --> 01:25:26.991
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

01:25:27.651 --> 01:25:35.175
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like people on Steam, Reddit, 4chan, they don't know who listens to 4chan anymore, and the Black Ops forums were complaining about it.

01:25:35.575 --> 01:25:37.095
[SPEAKER_13]: It can also be a pressing issue.

01:25:38.436 --> 01:25:45.759
[SPEAKER_13]: They're all duplicated, a few duplicators, and if it just happens that they're pressing copies of Mass Effect 2 and some of those happen to get in there.

01:25:45.999 --> 01:25:47.360
[SPEAKER_07]: Activision hasn't said shit about it, so

01:25:47.682 --> 01:25:52.047
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, which is funny, yeah, because that would mean Activision and EA are using the same presser.

01:25:52.688 --> 01:25:53.529
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, they do.

01:25:54.290 --> 01:25:59.616
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, Technicolor, they press discs for the movie industry, for everything.

01:26:00.037 --> 01:26:04.963
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, there's only a few duplicators that are out there, and aside from Nintendo actually doing carts and stuff, but...

01:26:07.866 --> 01:26:11.228
[SPEAKER_13]: These all get duplicated at a few duplicators around the world.

01:26:11.488 --> 01:26:13.069
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just whoever they decide to use.

01:26:13.930 --> 01:26:19.534
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very possible that they get stuff that maybe another company is using.

01:26:20.614 --> 01:26:25.898
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's travel around the world and look at release dates and see what's coming to a game store near you this week.

01:26:26.471 --> 01:26:30.493
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, this week we've got, it's starting to slow down a little bit, so we've got a few things.

01:26:30.574 --> 01:26:43.201
[SPEAKER_13]: Rise of the Guardians coming out on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, the Wii, the DS, the 3DS, and yeah.

01:26:43.762 --> 01:26:48.144
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the 3DS version of Pro Evo Soccer 2013, although I think that date's wrong.

01:26:48.264 --> 01:26:50.866
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe that's actually coming out next year, if I remember correctly.

01:26:51.366 --> 01:27:13.000
[SPEAKER_13]: Adventure Time, Hey Ice King, Why'd You Steal Our Garbage on 3DS and DS, also collector's editions for those, Hitman Absolution on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Persona 4 Golden on the Vita, PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale on the PS3 and the Vita, also, let's see what else we got here,

01:27:14.346 --> 01:27:15.067
[SPEAKER_13]: Scribblenauts Unlimited on PC

01:27:38.155 --> 01:27:56.117
[SPEAKER_13]: PC version came out a little bit later and everything else and Family Guy Back to the Multiverse on PS3 and 360 and kids learn and play Pets and Vets I think that's a re-release the thermometer goes in the butt

01:27:58.417 --> 01:28:00.719
[SPEAKER_13]: and Assassin's Creed 3 on PC.

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:02.681
[SPEAKER_13]: And that, I believe, is it?

01:28:02.701 --> 01:28:03.722
[SPEAKER_13]: What the hell is this?

01:28:03.943 --> 01:28:04.904
[SPEAKER_13]: Kids learn and play.

01:28:05.664 --> 01:28:08.287
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like a bundle, but I have never seen these.

01:28:09.068 --> 01:28:12.070
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah, it's some value games.

01:28:12.671 --> 01:28:13.051
[SPEAKER_13]: It's crap.

01:28:13.091 --> 01:28:13.432
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't buy it.

01:28:15.794 --> 01:28:17.915
[SPEAKER_15]: That in-depth review brought to you by Loki.

01:28:17.976 --> 01:28:18.236
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

01:28:19.096 --> 01:28:22.398
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's go to the Japanese release dates and what's coming out over there.

01:28:22.459 --> 01:28:32.225
[SPEAKER_15]: On November 22nd on the Xbox 360, Doom 3, the BFG edition, as well as Call of Duty Black Ops 2, this is the version with subtitles, is released in Japan.

01:28:32.265 --> 01:28:38.049
[SPEAKER_15]: There's also an Xbox Live special membership card to celebrate the Call of Duty release in Japan.

01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:43.012
[SPEAKER_15]: On the PlayStation 3, Call of Duty Black Ops 2 is out there as well.

01:28:43.052 --> 01:28:43.933
[SPEAKER_15]: Same with Doom 3.

01:28:44.033 --> 01:28:45.214
[SPEAKER_15]: There's some more stuff, though, as well.

01:28:45.774 --> 01:28:47.275
[SPEAKER_15]: Some games getting price reductions.

01:28:47.395 --> 01:28:50.996
[SPEAKER_15]: Grand Theft Auto 4, Infamous 2, Killzone 3, LittleBigPlanet 2.

01:28:51.136 --> 01:28:52.417
[SPEAKER_15]: All of them getting price reductions.

01:28:52.797 --> 01:28:59.019
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as new games go on the PlayStation 3, Mina No Golf 6, EX Troopers, Chaos Head.

01:28:59.039 --> 01:29:00.200
[SPEAKER_07]: That's everybody's golf.

01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:07.562
[SPEAKER_15]: Chaos Head Love Choo Choo and Chaos Head Noah as well as a double pack of both games are out there as well.

01:29:08.203 --> 01:29:08.343
[SPEAKER_15]: And...

01:29:09.844 --> 01:29:17.775
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what that is?

01:29:18.536 --> 01:29:19.778
[SPEAKER_07]: Space Battleship Yamato?

01:29:19.798 --> 01:29:20.338
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

01:29:20.358 --> 01:29:21.560
[SPEAKER_07]: In other words, Starblazers?

01:29:22.481 --> 01:29:22.602
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh.

01:29:22.802 --> 01:29:26.207
[SPEAKER_15]: Luxury limited edition and regular edition in Japan this week.

01:29:27.663 --> 01:29:34.789
[SPEAKER_15]: and a classic white slim console comes out if you need to get your Japanese PlayStation 3.

01:29:36.210 --> 01:29:38.872
[SPEAKER_15]: Looking at the other systems real quick, let me check on the Vita.

01:29:39.693 --> 01:29:44.576
[SPEAKER_15]: There's just another 3G Wi-Fi pack out this week that has Mineno Golf 6 with it.

01:29:45.157 --> 01:29:46.258
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's that, yay.

01:29:47.118 --> 01:29:48.098
[SPEAKER_15]: on the 3DS.

01:29:48.639 --> 01:29:50.439
[SPEAKER_15]: EX Troopers is out there as well.

01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:55.921
[SPEAKER_15]: On the 23rd, Pokemon Fushigi no Dungeon.

01:29:56.101 --> 01:29:58.002
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm assuming that's the Pokemon Dungeon Crawler game.

01:29:58.642 --> 01:29:59.662
[SPEAKER_07]: Fushigi is mysterious.

01:30:00.182 --> 01:30:04.084
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I keep wanting to say Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon, but it's a Pokemon game.

01:30:04.104 --> 01:30:05.064
[SPEAKER_07]: Pokemon Mysterious Dungeon.

01:30:05.084 --> 01:30:06.504
[SPEAKER_15]: Pikachu's Mysterious Dungeon or whatever.

01:30:08.866 --> 01:30:16.028
[SPEAKER_15]: Ochi, Manichi, Tamagotchi on the 3DS because Tamagotchi, yes, is still a thing, believe it or not.

01:30:16.348 --> 01:30:20.769
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I saw Furbies at Toys R Us the other day, so what's old is new again.

01:30:20.869 --> 01:30:22.169
[SPEAKER_07]: I blocked Furby on Facebook.

01:30:22.829 --> 01:30:33.371
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, the Wii U, keep in mind, not out over there in Japan until December the 8th, so we don't have those release dates for a little bit, but we'll work those into the rotation soon.

01:30:33.771 --> 01:30:36.892
[SPEAKER_15]: Otherwise, we'll go to Jamie for what's coming out in the UK.

01:30:37.702 --> 01:30:38.283
[SPEAKER_07]: Some stuff.

01:30:38.743 --> 01:30:39.023
[SPEAKER_07]: The end.

01:30:39.083 --> 01:30:39.444
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding.

01:30:40.344 --> 01:30:47.731
[SPEAKER_07]: On the 18th, Epic Mickey 2, Power of Illusion, and The Power of Two, Udraw Studio.

01:30:48.051 --> 01:30:51.954
[SPEAKER_07]: On the 20th, we have Hitman Absolution, Planetside, Next.

01:30:52.234 --> 01:30:54.256
[SPEAKER_07]: 21st, The Walking Dead, Episode 5, No Time Left.

01:30:55.397 --> 01:31:01.142
[SPEAKER_07]: 23rd, Assassin's Creed 3, Rise of the Guardians, Talisman Prologue.

01:31:02.243 --> 01:31:03.044
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's it.

01:31:04.522 --> 01:31:08.865
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, just a few more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

01:31:09.245 --> 01:31:10.686
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think we've got some Sony news.

01:31:10.746 --> 01:31:13.208
[SPEAKER_15]: We've talked Nintendo, we've talked Microsoft, but Loki?

01:31:13.868 --> 01:31:21.593
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, they're finally, well, they announced already that PlayStation Plus would be coming to the Vita, and they've now announced which day it's going to be coming out.

01:31:21.613 --> 01:31:23.574
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to be coming out tomorrow, on the November 19th.

01:31:24.194 --> 01:31:29.558
[SPEAKER_13]: And what's kind of awesome with that is they're also adding some games to the Instant Game Collection that will be available for the Vita.

01:31:30.338 --> 01:31:52.417
[SPEAKER_13]: and this includes some full Vita games including Uncharted, Golden Abyss, Jet Set Radio which is actually set to come out next week, Wipeout 2048, Gravity Rush, Tales from Space, Mutant Blobs Attack and I guess Final Fantasy Tactics, The War of the Lions that was a PSP title and that's

01:31:52.837 --> 01:31:53.277
[SPEAKER_13]: Not bad.

01:31:53.678 --> 01:31:59.161
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, PlayStation Plus, $18 for three months or $50 for the full year.

01:31:59.361 --> 01:32:12.248
[SPEAKER_13]: And I guess, obviously, if you have a PlayStation Plus membership, you also get all the free wonderful games library stuff with the PS3 and the one gigabyte of cloud storage, which is pretty awesome.

01:32:12.668 --> 01:32:14.429
[SPEAKER_13]: And I guess a gigabyte of cloud storage on the Vita.

01:32:14.489 --> 01:32:15.950
[SPEAKER_13]: I wonder if that's the same one gigabyte.

01:32:16.711 --> 01:32:19.012
[SPEAKER_16]: Is your Vita actually going to come out of storage now at this point?

01:32:19.488 --> 01:32:20.368
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's in my backpack.

01:32:20.668 --> 01:32:22.449
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it going to come out of your backpack?

01:32:23.909 --> 01:32:28.931
[SPEAKER_13]: No, because I have to actually become a member of PlayStation Plus and I just don't want to right now.

01:32:29.251 --> 01:32:30.051
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm excited.

01:32:30.151 --> 01:32:32.872
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm PlayStation Plus and I couldn't be more excited about this.

01:32:32.952 --> 01:32:35.533
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, oh my god, it's like Christmas on my Vita tomorrow.

01:32:35.573 --> 01:32:36.373
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to be great.

01:32:36.913 --> 01:32:38.653
[SPEAKER_15]: So yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

01:32:38.934 --> 01:32:40.554
[SPEAKER_15]: Vita's relevance is finally starting to come out.

01:32:41.587 --> 01:32:42.628
[SPEAKER_15]: Just in time for the holidays.

01:32:43.669 --> 01:32:50.093
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, well, also coming to the Vita, I think this is also tomorrow with the PlayStation Plus update, obviously.

01:32:50.633 --> 01:32:52.515
[SPEAKER_15]: A whole new firmware, 2.0.

01:32:53.395 --> 01:32:55.897
[SPEAKER_15]: A new email application for the Vita.

01:32:55.917 --> 01:33:01.101
[SPEAKER_15]: That's kind of interesting, but, well, it makes the 3G a little more lucrative, especially if you don't have a phone that does it.

01:33:01.261 --> 01:33:02.202
[SPEAKER_16]: With the coolest...

01:33:02.962 --> 01:33:04.343
[SPEAKER_16]: PlayStation's typing interface.

01:33:05.223 --> 01:33:06.964
[SPEAKER_16]: I get what they're doing.

01:33:08.565 --> 01:33:10.346
[SPEAKER_15]: It's easier to use than iPhone, honestly.

01:33:10.906 --> 01:33:11.346
[SPEAKER_15]: I think so.

01:33:12.226 --> 01:33:12.807
[SPEAKER_15]: On the Vita?

01:33:13.147 --> 01:33:13.767
[SPEAKER_15]: Heck yeah.

01:33:14.768 --> 01:33:19.510
[SPEAKER_16]: It's easier to have the key directly instead of having to memorize what it's under.

01:33:21.251 --> 01:33:23.594
[SPEAKER_16]: The Vita has that tanky style mode.

01:33:23.615 --> 01:33:28.621
[SPEAKER_15]: You can type on the keyboard and it's really responsive and fits a large part of the screen.

01:33:28.641 --> 01:33:29.963
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, the Vita is a touchscreen, isn't it?

01:33:30.243 --> 01:33:31.425
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, disregard.

01:33:31.465 --> 01:33:36.492
[SPEAKER_15]: You're thinking about Sony's PlayStation 3 predictive text, which the Vita will do as well.

01:33:37.113 --> 01:33:37.874
[SPEAKER_15]: So it has that.

01:33:38.334 --> 01:33:39.335
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll be over here if you need me.

01:33:40.617 --> 01:33:41.679
[SPEAKER_15]: That's alright.

01:33:41.779 --> 01:33:47.987
[SPEAKER_15]: Gmail, Yahoo, and other miscellaneous providers unsaid will be supported.

01:33:48.808 --> 01:33:51.732
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, finally, this is so dumb that they didn't have this before.

01:33:52.213 --> 01:33:55.798
[SPEAKER_15]: Wirelessly transmit between the PC and the Vita.

01:33:56.338 --> 01:34:02.723
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, browser and video apps will now do 1080p videos even though it's not like it's going to magically change the output.

01:34:02.763 --> 01:34:05.445
[SPEAKER_13]: What about wireless transmitting between the PS3 and the Vita?

01:34:06.045 --> 01:34:10.448
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not said, but I would think if it's wireless between the PC, why not?

01:34:10.488 --> 01:34:11.989
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I think it would be on the PlayStation 3.

01:34:12.089 --> 01:34:15.051
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to say I read that somewhere else that it will do that too.

01:34:15.111 --> 01:34:15.732
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank God.

01:34:16.312 --> 01:34:17.573
[SPEAKER_15]: Makes so much more sense.

01:34:18.234 --> 01:34:19.715
[SPEAKER_15]: So, very cool.

01:34:19.955 --> 01:34:22.276
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all coming as well this week.

01:34:23.177 --> 01:34:24.517
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura is taking it back this week.

01:34:46.707 --> 01:34:47.207
[SPEAKER_07]: I am.

01:34:47.788 --> 01:34:51.989
[SPEAKER_07]: The game of the week is Yars' Revenge for the Atari 2600.

01:34:52.570 --> 01:34:54.110
[SPEAKER_16]: Yars, not Yaris.

01:34:56.211 --> 01:34:57.292
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a great pick.

01:34:57.832 --> 01:35:09.297
[SPEAKER_13]: It's also a game that particularly illustrates the proper way to use an apostrophe with something that ends in an S. Although, to be honest, if they were ever going to make a second Yars game, Yars' Revenge would be kind of fun to play.

01:35:10.396 --> 01:35:11.436
[SPEAKER_07]: Be like Christine.

01:35:12.417 --> 01:35:15.338
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, words that don't seem to be ours.

01:35:15.438 --> 01:35:15.978
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

01:35:16.598 --> 01:35:24.742
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, it came out in 1982 and it was created by Howard Scott Warshall who wrote Raiders of the Lost Ark and E.T.

01:35:26.246 --> 01:35:28.047
[SPEAKER_07]: But we forgive him because of Yars' Revenge.

01:35:28.067 --> 01:35:28.907
[SPEAKER_15]: That's right.

01:35:29.047 --> 01:35:31.428
[SPEAKER_15]: For every bad game he made, there was a good game.

01:35:31.528 --> 01:35:34.509
[SPEAKER_15]: And let's not forget he was under tremendous pressure with E.T.

01:35:35.009 --> 01:35:36.049
[SPEAKER_15]: Read his side of it.

01:35:36.149 --> 01:35:37.890
[SPEAKER_15]: You'll feel a lot of sympathy for the guy.

01:35:37.930 --> 01:35:42.231
[SPEAKER_07]: Which isn't that like the plot of the Angry Video Game Nerds movie now?

01:35:42.691 --> 01:35:45.132
[SPEAKER_07]: Trying to find where all the cartridges of E.T.

01:35:45.232 --> 01:35:45.332
[SPEAKER_07]: are?

01:35:45.392 --> 01:35:45.892
[SPEAKER_15]: Who cares?

01:35:46.012 --> 01:35:47.253
[SPEAKER_15]: I care about the real story.

01:35:47.293 --> 01:35:47.753
[SPEAKER_07]: No offense.

01:35:48.473 --> 01:36:00.840
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, anyway, it was supposed to be a licensed port of a game called Star Castle, which there's a cannon that's protected by these counter-rotating shields, and you have to shoot holes in the shields to destroy the cannon inside.

01:36:01.740 --> 01:36:04.162
[SPEAKER_07]: But then again, once you shoot the holes, the cannon can shoot you.

01:36:05.302 --> 01:36:05.923
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um...

01:36:07.099 --> 01:36:08.380
[SPEAKER_15]: Kill or be killed.

01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:15.223
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so as they were developing the Atari version, it actually changed quite a bit.

01:36:15.663 --> 01:36:29.410
[SPEAKER_07]: So now your hero is called a yar, which is like a little insect thing that nibbles through the layer, and then it can shoot his cannon into the breach and kill the evil Kotile, which I think is how it was said.

01:36:30.551 --> 01:36:31.711
[SPEAKER_07]: who is on the other side of the barrier.

01:36:32.712 --> 01:36:42.939
[SPEAKER_07]: Although you can be shot at through the barrier, and it turns into a swirl.

01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:48.824
[SPEAKER_07]: However, you're warned before you get shot at, and you can go back to the other side of the little energy wall.

01:36:49.684 --> 01:36:53.227
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, I swear the first time I saw that I was like, is my TV fucked up?

01:36:54.335 --> 01:36:56.396
[SPEAKER_07]: but no, it's a party game.

01:36:56.456 --> 01:36:57.857
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also a little safe zone.

01:36:57.937 --> 01:37:00.098
[SPEAKER_07]: The neutral zone.

01:37:00.318 --> 01:37:04.360
[SPEAKER_07]: The swirls can get you but the little torpedoes cannot and you cannot shoot from within the neutral zone.

01:37:05.996 --> 01:37:21.840
[SPEAKER_07]: So you've got different scoring, and the highest thing you can get is if you shoot one of those swirls in mid-air with the Zorlon Cannon, which is this little shooty thing, you get 6,000 points and an extra life, but you can get only up to 9 lives.

01:37:22.601 --> 01:37:27.002
[SPEAKER_07]: And each level ends when you kill the Kotyl or the swirl.

01:37:28.002 --> 01:37:36.345
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, basically when you reach 70,000 points, the shield will turn blue, and the swirls come out with more frequency.

01:37:36.465 --> 01:37:46.409
[SPEAKER_07]: If you get 150,000, the shield turns gray, and, you know, even more crap comes out, and you get a guided missile, it's gonna get ya.

01:37:46.429 --> 01:37:54.633
[SPEAKER_07]: 230,000 points, the shield turns pink, and the swirls will begin to fire three times more frequently, and not give you warnings.

01:37:55.333 --> 01:37:56.655
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a comic book that came out with it.

01:37:57.215 --> 01:38:09.789
[SPEAKER_07]: It had a mini comic book that was in the game package and it gave the story behind the game and why it was seeking vengeance because apparently the thingy blew up their world.

01:38:11.579 --> 01:38:12.779
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there was an album.

01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:16.601
[SPEAKER_07]: It had a theme song and a radio drama of the comic book.

01:38:17.621 --> 01:38:18.341
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was kind of neat.

01:38:18.361 --> 01:38:20.922
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also an Easter egg in the game.

01:38:21.002 --> 01:38:27.004
[SPEAKER_07]: If you kill a swirl in midair, a black vertical line appears on the screen across the spot where the swirl was shot.

01:38:28.544 --> 01:38:34.049
[SPEAKER_07]: The line is referred to in the manual as Ghost of Yars and warns the player to stay off the mean streak.

01:38:34.589 --> 01:38:48.400
[SPEAKER_07]: If the player moves vertically along that line and is about 1-2 inches below the middle of the screen when the explosion closes, the game will end and go into a game select screen with the programmer's initials HSW that's forward and backwards on the word select.

01:38:49.941 --> 01:38:54.625
[SPEAKER_07]: If you do it in game 6 or 7, JOV appears which is under the creator's initials.

01:38:55.285 --> 01:38:58.668
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a remake for the Game Boy Color in 1999.

01:38:59.108 --> 01:39:03.031
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2005, of course, it came out on the Atari Flashback 2.

01:39:03.651 --> 01:39:06.093
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a 3 and 1 that came on the GBA in 2005.

01:39:07.314 --> 01:39:09.576
[SPEAKER_07]: And that also came with Pong and Asteroids.

01:39:10.376 --> 01:39:11.837
[SPEAKER_07]: It's available on Game Room in 2010.

01:39:11.897 --> 01:39:15.540
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a reimagining that came out on Xbox Live Arcade.

01:39:17.702 --> 01:39:20.744
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, I think it's not out yet on PS3.

01:39:20.764 --> 01:39:21.925
[SPEAKER_07]: They said they were going to be doing it.

01:39:22.842 --> 01:39:23.663
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:39:42.756 --> 01:39:45.679
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's supposed to be a lot more like the 2600 game.

01:39:45.719 --> 01:39:46.360
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't played it.

01:39:47.341 --> 01:39:55.390
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's another one that's free on browsers that supports HTML5 that is on Atari.com with other classic Atari games.

01:39:56.371 --> 01:40:00.856
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a sequel called Yar's Return that's on the Atari Flashback too.

01:40:01.437 --> 01:40:01.697
[SPEAKER_07]: The end.

01:40:02.725 --> 01:40:04.005
[SPEAKER_15]: There it is, your classic game of the week.

01:40:04.065 --> 01:40:06.746
[SPEAKER_15]: A real classic going way back to the Atari 2600.

01:40:06.846 --> 01:40:08.087
[SPEAKER_15]: Yars' Revenge.

01:40:08.267 --> 01:40:10.688
[SPEAKER_15]: Undoubtedly one of the best 2600 games they ever did.

01:40:11.988 --> 01:40:12.548
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.

01:40:13.129 --> 01:40:13.569
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

01:40:13.609 --> 01:40:14.929
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we are going to take a break, guys.

01:40:14.949 --> 01:40:30.235
[SPEAKER_15]: When we come back, we've got more of Orange Laundry to come, including rapid-fire news, the Google Question of the Week, some other gaming-related news, and a hilarious follow-up to something I said last week would probably not go away anytime soon.

01:40:30.255 --> 01:40:30.615
[SPEAKER_10]: The futures!

01:40:31.356 --> 01:40:32.038
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really funny.

01:40:32.058 --> 01:40:36.209
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll get to that in just a little bit when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:40:43.548 --> 01:40:52.114
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live with episode number 482 of our show for this November the 18th of 2012.

01:40:52.914 --> 01:40:57.517
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to get into some rapid fire news, but first I got to ask Loki.

01:40:57.577 --> 01:40:58.338
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki's over there.

01:40:58.758 --> 01:41:01.920
[SPEAKER_15]: He's like, all right, let me touch the Wii U tablet.

01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:04.121
[SPEAKER_07]: He's going to touch the Wii.

01:41:04.882 --> 01:41:06.623
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, Loki, touch the Wii U tablet.

01:41:07.351 --> 01:41:07.912
[SPEAKER_15]: I like it.

01:41:08.072 --> 01:41:14.376
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it has a good, for such a big frickin' thing, it's got a really nice feel to it.

01:41:15.257 --> 01:41:22.822
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, I mean, as far as the placements of the analog sticks, they're comfortable, but hitting, like, the buttons below it is not quite comfortable.

01:41:23.262 --> 01:41:34.670
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, if you're trying to hit the A, like, the A button, if there was a game that you were using, you know, like First Versus Shooters and stuff, where the A button might be used, that is a bit, you know, that could cramp up your hand pretty bad.

01:41:34.830 --> 01:41:38.491
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what's strange about that?

01:41:40.291 --> 01:41:47.473
[SPEAKER_16]: I felt that in the menus, and I think this might be more related to the Xbox 360 controller since they just flipped where the buttons are.

01:41:47.933 --> 01:41:54.555
[SPEAKER_16]: I kind of noticed that problem in the menus, but the couple of games that I was playing through didn't really have finger placement issues.

01:41:56.875 --> 01:42:06.937
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, if you want to follow me on Miiverse, again, I said this quickly in the first part of the show, but if you did pick up a Wii U and you want to follow me on Miiverse, my name on the Wii, really creative, y'all, Rob Roberts.

01:42:07.698 --> 01:42:08.218
[SPEAKER_15]: All one word.

01:42:08.918 --> 01:42:09.158
[SPEAKER_15]: I know.

01:42:09.478 --> 01:42:10.298
[SPEAKER_15]: Really tough to figure out.

01:42:10.938 --> 01:42:11.218
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

01:42:11.658 --> 01:42:18.540
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's travel through some rapid-fire news and talk quickly about what else is going on in the gaming world.

01:42:18.620 --> 01:42:19.300
[SPEAKER_15]: Not just a Wii.

01:42:21.454 --> 01:42:23.336
[SPEAKER_13]: StarCraft II, Heart of the Swarm

01:42:41.915 --> 01:42:49.003
[SPEAKER_13]: and of course the Digital Deluxe and Collector's Edition version will be available as well priced at $59.99 and $79.99 respectively.

01:42:50.264 --> 01:43:00.516
[SPEAKER_13]: And the Digital Deluxe version like anything else that is Blizzard will contain stuff that doesn't necessarily apply to the game that you're buying which doesn't make any fucking sense to me.

01:43:01.096 --> 01:43:14.890
[SPEAKER_13]: You get a pet for World of Warcraft and a new sigil for Diablo 3 Someone explain this to me Why the fuck would I buy a collector's edition for one game to get shit for another game?

01:43:14.910 --> 01:43:18.894
[SPEAKER_13]: That doesn't make any goddamn sense Because you're already playing the other game, especially WoW

01:43:19.494 --> 01:43:22.155
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a lot of Blizzard crossover in the fandom.

01:43:22.515 --> 01:43:30.796
[SPEAKER_15]: I would say there's more synergy within that fandom than almost any other type of company with the exception of maybe Squeenix.

01:43:31.456 --> 01:43:32.296
[SPEAKER_15]: Pre-Eidos.

01:43:32.597 --> 01:43:34.977
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can get StarCraft Pets in WoW.

01:43:35.437 --> 01:43:37.077
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, there's a lot of that crossover.

01:43:37.137 --> 01:43:39.498
[SPEAKER_15]: But Sigils, really?

01:43:40.338 --> 01:43:40.738
[SPEAKER_15]: Really?

01:43:41.778 --> 01:43:42.718
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a bit of a stretch.

01:43:43.519 --> 01:43:44.439
[SPEAKER_16]: But what else are they going to give you?

01:43:44.499 --> 01:43:45.559
[SPEAKER_16]: A freaking legendary drop?

01:43:46.064 --> 01:43:46.544
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

01:43:46.604 --> 01:43:49.045
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's just kind of dumb that they have that.

01:43:49.625 --> 01:43:53.946
[SPEAKER_13]: Behind the scenes DVD slash Blu-ray and soundtrack.

01:43:54.106 --> 01:43:57.827
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, Heart of the Swarm hardcover art book and Zerg Rush mouse pad.

01:43:58.908 --> 01:44:00.148
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me put it this way, okay?

01:44:01.128 --> 01:44:04.449
[SPEAKER_13]: Rational people out there, just don't fucking buy the collector's edition.

01:44:04.489 --> 01:44:10.711
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't need to spend $40 extra for a pet in WoW and a goddamn mouse pad.

01:44:11.391 --> 01:44:12.572
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not just...

01:44:14.012 --> 01:44:14.612
[SPEAKER_13]: Resist.

01:44:14.973 --> 01:44:15.653
[SPEAKER_13]: You can do it.

01:44:15.813 --> 01:44:16.693
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, seriously.

01:44:17.534 --> 01:44:19.955
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you are an addict and bought it, give me the pet.

01:44:21.255 --> 01:44:24.637
[SPEAKER_16]: I would be glad to give you mine because otherwise the code will be completely unredeemed.

01:44:25.878 --> 01:44:26.198
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

01:44:26.398 --> 01:44:29.219
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you have the one from the original StarCraft 2 release?

01:44:29.359 --> 01:44:29.799
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I do not.

01:44:29.879 --> 01:44:30.079
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:31.720
[SPEAKER_16]: I will send that your way when I get home.

01:44:32.300 --> 01:44:32.761
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

01:44:33.281 --> 01:44:34.101
[SPEAKER_07]: So I win.

01:44:34.241 --> 01:44:34.701
[SPEAKER_07]: I win.

01:44:34.782 --> 01:44:35.502
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, you can't have it.

01:44:35.542 --> 01:44:36.983
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, you're making food and not in the room.

01:44:37.323 --> 01:44:37.903
[SPEAKER_16]: Disqualified.

01:44:40.590 --> 01:44:45.432
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale comes out next week, and they've already announced their first bit of DLC.

01:44:45.492 --> 01:44:46.152
[SPEAKER_13]: What, D?

01:44:46.592 --> 01:44:47.553
[SPEAKER_13]: Early DLC?

01:44:47.633 --> 01:44:48.493
[SPEAKER_13]: What the fuck?

01:44:48.633 --> 01:44:48.933
[SPEAKER_13]: Why?

01:44:49.033 --> 01:44:49.833
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not paying for DLC.

01:44:49.953 --> 01:44:51.934
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, good, you don't have to, because it's actually free.

01:44:52.454 --> 01:45:06.159
[SPEAKER_13]: And the two characters they're going to be adding to the roster include, um, Kat, who is from Gravity Rush, the Vita game, and, um, I guess Emmett Graves, who is the character from Starhawk.

01:45:06.619 --> 01:45:32.772
[SPEAKER_13]: and what's kind of cool is apparently the unique gameplay styles from both of those games are going to cross over into it including Kat's ability to manipulate gravity and Emmet's ability to kind of call the support stuff from Starhawk the build as you kind of go type thing so that's pretty neat and free DLC is always awesome and it's kind of cool to see if they're going to be expanding this game so

01:45:34.452 --> 01:45:43.175
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe when the Game of the Year edition comes out with all the characters and they're making certain picking it up, but still pretty neat.

01:45:43.315 --> 01:45:51.939
[SPEAKER_13]: And last but not least, and I've actually used this company before, FigurePrints is actually doing something now with Minecraft where you can actually export a part of your world

01:45:52.879 --> 01:45:55.261
[SPEAKER_13]: and have it printed in 3D.

01:45:55.822 --> 01:45:59.726
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right, your own Minecraft world creations in 3D.

01:46:00.467 --> 01:46:08.875
[SPEAKER_13]: And you just have to download the app that's on the Fingerprints website, just fingerprints.com slash Minecraft.

01:46:09.956 --> 01:46:32.350
[SPEAKER_13]: and you can go check it out and I guess the price is very depending on the size of your model that you're having printed and they kind of give some examples and they're pretty cool looking I had gotten one from my Xbox 360 avatar so I actually have an avatar you know 3D avatar of myself at my desk which is pretty awesome

01:46:33.170 --> 01:46:38.954
[SPEAKER_13]: But, yeah, it doesn't really say how much it would cost for your creations.

01:46:39.414 --> 01:46:45.058
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, there would be some cool stuff I'd want to make from our world, but I'd have to see how much this is.

01:46:46.279 --> 01:46:48.060
[SPEAKER_13]: Looks like it may only be like one chunk.

01:46:49.441 --> 01:46:53.443
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm thinking it might be one chunk, but neat.

01:46:54.224 --> 01:46:54.684
[SPEAKER_13]: Kind of cool.

01:46:54.844 --> 01:46:55.224
[SPEAKER_13]: Looks cool.

01:46:55.504 --> 01:46:55.665
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

01:46:56.710 --> 01:47:12.557
[SPEAKER_16]: Moving on, classic Dragon Quest fans will rejoice in the news that the Heartbeat Studio that originally developed the games in the Super Nintendo and PS1 games that closed shortly thereafter is up for a revival as the Genius Sonority.

01:47:13.357 --> 01:47:17.559
[SPEAKER_16]: They previously worked on Pokemon Colosseum, Dragon Quest Swords, and the Dinpamin.

01:47:17.719 --> 01:47:19.060
[SPEAKER_16]: They came by wave.

01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:28.210
[SPEAKER_16]: Manaba Yamana revealed by Twitter that Heartbeat will be relaunched after a decade, starting early next year with a new business perspective.

01:47:28.811 --> 01:47:33.957
[SPEAKER_16]: According to Inside Games, Yamana said to expect a new webpage with more information next year.

01:47:34.397 --> 01:47:37.100
[SPEAKER_16]: Can only imagine what their debut title is going to be.

01:47:38.799 --> 01:47:41.660
[SPEAKER_16]: Origin has been hit by a series of security breaches.

01:47:41.780 --> 01:47:46.663
[SPEAKER_16]: As users come to find out, their accounts have been cracked and personal details have been leaked.

01:47:47.703 --> 01:47:48.263
[SPEAKER_16]: Sigh.

01:47:48.503 --> 01:47:53.465
[SPEAKER_16]: To make matters worse, EA's own security measures ensure victims aren't resolving the issue.

01:47:53.525 --> 01:48:01.189
[SPEAKER_16]: Because it's so unable to log back in, change your email address back, change your password, certain things along those lines.

01:48:02.069 --> 01:48:13.353
[SPEAKER_16]: Users affected by the attack are told that their email address is invalid whenever they try to log in, and as soon as they call EA to find out what's wrong, they get shut down by representatives who can't help them without a receipt and valid date of birth.

01:48:14.173 --> 01:48:15.954
[SPEAKER_13]: S. M. H.

01:48:16.385 --> 01:48:19.787
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, with validated birth courses being changed by said hacker.

01:48:20.827 --> 01:48:27.670
[SPEAKER_16]: Because, you know, that has to be something that will change because you will mysteriously be born at a different date than you once were.

01:48:28.731 --> 01:48:30.151
[SPEAKER_16]: God bless web development.

01:48:30.491 --> 01:48:35.314
[SPEAKER_16]: NeoGAF has managed to compile tens of thousands of threads.

01:48:35.334 --> 01:48:36.214
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, that wouldn't surprise me.

01:48:36.274 --> 01:48:44.458
[SPEAKER_16]: Ten threads of complaints on EA's official forums and just a sample of the overall total of grief being expunged on the internet.

01:48:44.998 --> 01:48:46.941
[SPEAKER_16]: If you use Origin, do your due diligence.

01:48:47.282 --> 01:48:52.669
[SPEAKER_16]: Unique password, make sure all your stuff is correct so you at least have a remote chance of getting back into your account.

01:48:53.430 --> 01:48:54.171
[SPEAKER_16]: Be internet safe.

01:48:54.792 --> 01:49:00.160
[SPEAKER_15]: Since you brought up NeoGAF, I don't visit that site an awful lot because it's a little too busy and I have too much ADD.

01:49:01.781 --> 01:49:27.351
[SPEAKER_15]: but there was like the most winning thread I've ever seen on a web forum was on NeoGAF this week and it had to do with photoshopping your favorite or no a descriptive animated gif as the box art for a game like I'm describing this and I'm doing a terrible job but like there was this great like somebody photoshopped a box art for Tokyo Jungle and it was like these two kitties and a dog all wrestling and it was really funny like there was just all this kind of stuff

01:49:27.871 --> 01:49:30.632
[SPEAKER_15]: Grand Theft Auto 5 with a cop taking some guy out.

01:49:30.873 --> 01:49:34.995
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like all these great animated GIFs from around the internet on video game box art.

01:49:35.175 --> 01:49:38.396
[SPEAKER_15]: That's absolutely nothing to do with what you just talked about, but I like GIFs.

01:49:39.497 --> 01:49:40.097
[SPEAKER_15]: Who doesn't?

01:49:41.598 --> 01:49:45.159
[SPEAKER_16]: And two days ago was officially Miyamoto's 60th birthday.

01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:48.401
[SPEAKER_16]: Not too much need to be said for a man like him.

01:49:48.621 --> 01:49:56.225
[SPEAKER_16]: Imagine how the state of games would be different had Shigeru Miyamoto and Nintendo and the entire uprising that has happened on the last...

01:49:57.105 --> 01:49:59.486
[SPEAKER_16]: Three decades not actually occurred.

01:50:00.926 --> 01:50:01.366
[SPEAKER_16]: Uprising?

01:50:02.087 --> 01:50:02.747
[SPEAKER_16]: Bad choice of words.

01:50:02.787 --> 01:50:03.307
[SPEAKER_07]: Upchucking?

01:50:04.387 --> 01:50:08.408
[SPEAKER_16]: In some cases, like the value Wii games, I suppose.

01:50:08.829 --> 01:50:10.109
[SPEAKER_07]: How about Uther News?

01:50:10.849 --> 01:50:11.309
[SPEAKER_16]: Uther News?

01:50:11.629 --> 01:50:17.031
[SPEAKER_07]: Tom Hardy is going to be playing the lead in Splinter Cell for the movie version.

01:50:17.171 --> 01:50:17.731
[SPEAKER_07]: Sam Fisher.

01:50:18.612 --> 01:50:18.912
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

01:50:19.512 --> 01:50:25.934
[SPEAKER_07]: However, he's also slated to join Michael Fassbender in an Assassin's Creed film.

01:50:26.294 --> 01:50:26.434
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

01:50:28.355 --> 01:50:54.095
[SPEAKER_07]: also god as if this wasn't enough who remembers Barkley Shut Up and Jam well the group that did Barkley Shut Up and Jam Gaiden the sequel that was all completely parody have a new kickstarter up to make a game called Magical Realms of Tirnanog Escape from Necron 7 Revenge of Kokolin the official game of the movie chapter 2 of the Hoops Barkley saga that's awesome

01:50:55.259 --> 01:50:57.580
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Jet Set Radio Vita will be out November 20th.

01:50:58.161 --> 01:51:01.763
[SPEAKER_07]: And a mobile version will be out in nine days after for iOS and Android.

01:51:02.043 --> 01:51:02.383
[SPEAKER_07]: The end.

01:51:03.764 --> 01:51:05.865
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's get to the foogle question of the week.

01:51:14.089 --> 01:51:17.771
[SPEAKER_15]: Take Facebook and Google Plus and slam... Yes, people are on Google Plus.

01:51:18.031 --> 01:51:19.852
[SPEAKER_15]: And slam them together and you get foogle.

01:51:19.872 --> 01:51:20.673
[SPEAKER_07]: Make him do it.

01:51:20.713 --> 01:51:22.034
[SPEAKER_07]: Make him have retarded babies.

01:51:23.835 --> 01:51:24.095
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

01:51:26.465 --> 01:51:26.965
[SPEAKER_15]: Fugle.

01:51:27.306 --> 01:51:28.266
[SPEAKER_15]: Go Fugle yourself.

01:51:29.207 --> 01:51:29.527
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

01:51:31.549 --> 01:51:37.874
[SPEAKER_15]: Every week we ask a question on our Fugle communities and we get answers and we read some of our favorite answers on the show.

01:51:39.575 --> 01:51:44.219
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a lot of responses this week because I actually planned ahead this week and asked the question a whole day early.

01:51:44.319 --> 01:51:46.801
[SPEAKER_15]: So you're very welcome that we get more participation this week.

01:51:47.481 --> 01:51:54.468
[SPEAKER_15]: Very controversial article going around the internet this week because, you know, how else do you get hits for your website?

01:51:54.508 --> 01:52:00.354
[SPEAKER_15]: Stir up some controversy like determining the all-time 100 best video games.

01:52:00.435 --> 01:52:06.201
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, usually, I wouldn't give two shits about a list like this because everybody's got one on their site, whatever.

01:52:07.181 --> 01:52:08.222
[SPEAKER_15]: Timemagazine.com

01:52:26.139 --> 01:52:32.387
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, I don't have time to read the entire list here, but just to give you an idea of some of the things they named.

01:52:33.048 --> 01:52:34.710
[SPEAKER_15]: The Oregon Trail was on there.

01:52:36.753 --> 01:52:38.475
[SPEAKER_15]: Mass Effect 3 was on there.

01:52:41.814 --> 01:53:07.240
[SPEAKER_15]: when I looked at the list I saw it as a little more like these are influential games not necessarily the best games but games that were felt and there's only two games from this decade on the entire list from the 2010s Mass Effect 3 and Batman Arkham City which, well, Batman Arkham City was a pretty fucking great game too both pretty worthy both pretty worthy

01:53:08.501 --> 01:53:14.469
[SPEAKER_15]: The oldest games on the list from the 1970s The Oregon Trail, Hunt the Wumpus Does anyone remember that?

01:53:14.569 --> 01:53:22.679
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually remember the Wumpus game Pong, Breakout, Space Invaders, Adventure, and Asteroids

01:53:23.120 --> 01:53:23.641
[SPEAKER_15]: No Guardian Legend

01:53:41.337 --> 01:53:43.779
[SPEAKER_15]: They did Final Fantasy 7, and yes, no Guardian Legend.

01:53:44.079 --> 01:53:44.780
[SPEAKER_15]: Bastards!

01:53:45.280 --> 01:53:46.261
[SPEAKER_16]: They picked 7.

01:53:46.301 --> 01:53:47.743
[SPEAKER_16]: That is amazing justification.

01:53:47.983 --> 01:53:48.603
[SPEAKER_15]: I can see.

01:53:48.683 --> 01:53:48.984
[SPEAKER_15]: I can see.

01:53:49.004 --> 01:53:49.264
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

01:53:49.864 --> 01:53:55.509
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, look, we asked you guys on Google Plus and on Facebook, we're sure many of you saw this list.

01:53:55.589 --> 01:54:02.936
[SPEAKER_15]: What was your impression of the list, being that Time is more of a news organization than something that typically caters to entertainment?

01:54:03.296 --> 01:54:04.437
[SPEAKER_15]: Were they mostly right?

01:54:04.637 --> 01:54:06.739
[SPEAKER_15]: Were there any glaring omissions or issues?

01:54:07.499 --> 01:54:09.902
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's some of the answers from Google+.

01:54:11.063 --> 01:54:16.149
[SPEAKER_15]: Kevin R replied and said, I think Wii Sports should not be on this list.

01:54:16.870 --> 01:54:20.894
[SPEAKER_15]: What about cult followings like Disgaea and .hack and Persona?

01:54:21.314 --> 01:54:23.557
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see some that are not for the mainstream.

01:54:25.086 --> 01:54:29.448
[SPEAKER_15]: Kevin, I'm totally with you on the second half, but Wii Sports not being on the list.

01:54:29.488 --> 01:54:30.829
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, here's the thing.

01:54:32.530 --> 01:54:35.892
[SPEAKER_15]: The fact that it's Time Magazine is why Wii Sports is on the list.

01:54:36.072 --> 01:54:38.393
[SPEAKER_15]: This was not EGM or some game.

01:54:38.773 --> 01:54:44.036
[SPEAKER_15]: You have to remember, Wii Sports broke the mainstream in a way very few video games have.

01:54:44.116 --> 01:54:46.317
[SPEAKER_15]: It is the top-selling video game ever.

01:54:47.137 --> 01:54:47.858
[SPEAKER_15]: Am I not right?

01:54:47.878 --> 01:54:49.219
[SPEAKER_15]: 100% agree.

01:54:50.959 --> 01:55:00.902
[SPEAKER_16]: Very unfortunate for us and what we do, our feelings and what we say, but Wii Sports is the number one reason why, as you said before, the Wii was such a runaway sale, period.

01:55:01.042 --> 01:55:01.902
[SPEAKER_15]: But I get it.

01:55:01.922 --> 01:55:06.523
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not here to argue with listeners who are commenting on Google for the first time.

01:55:06.804 --> 01:55:07.584
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not doing that.

01:55:07.984 --> 01:55:13.645
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm just saying, think about it this way, because even though it's a gamer, you might be like, there really isn't much of a game here.

01:55:13.685 --> 01:55:15.306
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just flailing about here, but...

01:55:15.806 --> 01:55:17.027
[SPEAKER_07]: Only way bowling counts.

01:55:17.347 --> 01:55:20.388
[SPEAKER_15]: That flailing got sold a hell of a lot of systems.

01:55:22.269 --> 01:55:29.133
[SPEAKER_15]: Elliot B says, I disagree that Batman Arkham City and Mass Effect 3 are the best games of the 2010s.

01:55:29.573 --> 01:55:32.415
[SPEAKER_15]: Portal 2 and Minecraft are far better.

01:55:33.855 --> 01:55:35.876
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Portal 2 I'll give you.

01:55:36.357 --> 01:55:37.897
[SPEAKER_07]: Minecraft, vomit.

01:55:38.938 --> 01:55:40.359
[SPEAKER_07]: Until someone buys me a copy.

01:55:41.319 --> 01:55:43.820
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry, but your opinion doesn't count on Minecraft.

01:55:45.538 --> 01:55:47.720
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that sounds harsh, but I'm sorry.

01:55:48.740 --> 01:55:49.781
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's the thing I do want to say.

01:55:49.821 --> 01:55:51.823
[SPEAKER_15]: To be fair, Portal 1 is on the list.

01:55:52.303 --> 01:55:54.585
[SPEAKER_15]: And so they did the whole no sequels thing.

01:55:54.665 --> 01:55:58.107
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm okay with Portal 1 topping Portal 2.

01:55:59.348 --> 01:56:03.992
[SPEAKER_15]: Minecraft, I think that's one of those let it age like a wine games.

01:56:05.211 --> 01:56:11.075
[SPEAKER_15]: I think in five more years, I think we haven't really felt Minecraft's influence yet.

01:56:11.755 --> 01:56:22.442
[SPEAKER_15]: Batman Arkham City and Mass Effect 3 were final games in long-running series, or the latest games in long-running series.

01:56:22.522 --> 01:56:24.523
[SPEAKER_15]: They had a little different battle to that list.

01:56:27.085 --> 01:56:27.385
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see.

01:56:29.412 --> 01:56:31.034
[SPEAKER_15]: Robert G picked up on something.

01:56:31.374 --> 01:56:33.676
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a good list, but it had some editing problems.

01:56:33.916 --> 01:56:37.200
[SPEAKER_15]: Atari's adventure screenshot was not from the actual game.

01:56:37.780 --> 01:56:43.105
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to see if that is... Is that not from the game?

01:56:43.165 --> 01:56:43.946
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm trying to look at it.

01:56:44.367 --> 01:56:45.448
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess maybe not.

01:56:45.568 --> 01:56:50.232
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it looks like a game screenshot, but I'm thinking like, when do you take the red dragon there?

01:56:50.292 --> 01:56:51.894
[SPEAKER_15]: Weren't they all in front of little castles?

01:56:52.314 --> 01:56:53.876
[SPEAKER_15]: Or could you move them around?

01:56:55.370 --> 01:57:16.103
[SPEAKER_15]: I think someone like googled that and said let's use this one probably probably it could have been like you know it could have been like a hacked image or something like that maybe so I think they could have found a better one it's like when you go to the movie and like the scene you saw in the trailer isn't in the movie which happens all the time it happens all the time now that was a big thing in TV commercials for a while too

01:57:17.931 --> 01:57:19.232
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, TV commercials for shows.

01:57:19.272 --> 01:57:20.072
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, all the time.

01:57:20.293 --> 01:57:20.673
[SPEAKER_15]: All the time.

01:57:20.993 --> 01:57:23.455
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, that was some of the answers from Google+.

01:57:23.475 --> 01:57:26.577
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry I didn't read them all, but there's some good stuff there, so I hope you will check them out.

01:57:27.177 --> 01:57:28.838
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me read some of the answers from Facebook.

01:57:28.958 --> 01:57:43.768
[SPEAKER_15]: Critical Myth, also on the VOG Network, replies, starting off, It was a nice walk through gaming nostalgia, but whenever it comes to lists like these, they can't possibly take our subjective likes and dislikes and personal histories into account to match our expectations or preferences.

01:57:44.529 --> 01:57:45.649
[SPEAKER_15]: A very good reminder.

01:57:47.773 --> 01:57:50.339
[SPEAKER_15]: But hey, we still have to argue about it anyway, right?

01:57:51.331 --> 01:58:04.438
[SPEAKER_15]: Tiara, our good buddy Tiara from geek-life.com replies and says, Don't get me wrong, Final Fantasy Tactics is one of my favorite games, but how did that make it on the list, but Final Fantasy 4 and 6 didn't?

01:58:04.998 --> 01:58:07.780
[SPEAKER_15]: Overall, a lot of good choices, but some questionable ones as well.

01:58:08.260 --> 01:58:12.442
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Tiara, I'm pretty sure 4 and 6 didn't make the list because 7 did.

01:58:12.663 --> 01:58:12.903
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

01:58:13.243 --> 01:58:19.486
[SPEAKER_15]: And now we're going to go back and have that old argument about Final Fantasy 7, so I'll just let that be.

01:58:19.806 --> 01:58:20.827
[SPEAKER_16]: Interesting that they did jump.

01:58:23.391 --> 01:58:30.742
[SPEAKER_16]: Not that the Final Fantasy universe was canonical from release to release, but interesting that they would jump out to Tactics in addition to 7.

01:58:31.553 --> 01:58:31.973
[SPEAKER_07]: Breath of Fire

01:58:54.944 --> 01:58:57.006
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a big list.

01:58:57.046 --> 01:58:58.727
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I have a quesadilla in my mouth.

01:58:58.967 --> 01:59:01.769
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, I'm just using it as an example.

01:59:01.809 --> 01:59:06.352
[SPEAKER_07]: Did they do Tactics Ogre or anything that was that same style of gameplay?

01:59:06.753 --> 01:59:20.542
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Final Fantasy Tactics really, I think, took out sort of something that was almost niche, like just slightly outside the niche level, and really brought it into mainstream because it was a big name that everyone recognized.

01:59:20.562 --> 01:59:21.223
[SPEAKER_15]: I would agree with that.

01:59:21.503 --> 01:59:24.784
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm scanning this list real quick trying to look for tactical games.

01:59:25.104 --> 01:59:26.684
[SPEAKER_15]: Desktop Tower Defense.

01:59:27.504 --> 01:59:28.725
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't even know what that game is.

01:59:28.805 --> 01:59:31.545
[SPEAKER_15]: It sounds like it could be tactical.

01:59:32.266 --> 01:59:33.086
[SPEAKER_16]: It's Tower Defense.

01:59:33.106 --> 01:59:34.066
[SPEAKER_16]: That's about all you have to say.

01:59:36.086 --> 01:59:39.927
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, but look at all the fucking Tower Defense games we have now.

01:59:40.367 --> 01:59:41.388
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a huge part of iOS.

01:59:42.128 --> 01:59:43.288
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I agree with it on the list.

01:59:43.428 --> 01:59:46.089
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm saying the genre... How dare you disagree?

01:59:49.192 --> 02:00:05.674
[SPEAKER_16]: not a lot of other tactical games on the list I don't see a lot of those other games you were mentioning I definitely agree with Jamie's point is that they took a beautiful world with a great story gave it a similar enough engine and it is one of the only strategy games to hit as wide adoption as it did

02:00:07.118 --> 02:00:09.741
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see some of the other answers from Facebook.

02:00:10.501 --> 02:00:13.224
[SPEAKER_15]: Daniel S replied and said, yeah, didn't bother with the list.

02:00:13.604 --> 02:00:15.926
[SPEAKER_15]: They're just bait for more page clicks.

02:00:16.406 --> 02:00:19.029
[SPEAKER_15]: Check out IGN's top 100 RPGs list.

02:00:19.309 --> 02:00:20.690
[SPEAKER_15]: They put Persona 4 at number 90.

02:00:21.251 --> 02:00:22.612
[SPEAKER_15]: I stopped reading lists after that.

02:00:23.112 --> 02:00:29.533
[SPEAKER_15]: While I don't totally disagree with you, one reason I picked this list in particular is that it is Time Magazine.

02:00:29.714 --> 02:00:31.594
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not a video game site.

02:00:31.714 --> 02:00:32.654
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like a news site.

02:00:32.754 --> 02:00:37.575
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, while yes, to some extent, it probably still is bait for page clicks.

02:00:37.635 --> 02:00:38.676
[SPEAKER_15]: Most things on the internet are.

02:00:39.316 --> 02:00:43.737
[SPEAKER_15]: I kind of felt there was still that history behind the publication.

02:00:43.817 --> 02:00:46.337
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be different if this is something they were putting in their magazine.

02:00:47.257 --> 02:00:49.558
[SPEAKER_07]: In actual print publication, but it's not.

02:00:50.842 --> 02:00:54.564
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't... Has Time done an actual video game issue?

02:00:55.405 --> 02:00:57.846
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think... Well, in the 80s probably.

02:00:58.587 --> 02:01:04.610
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't think we've had anything modern coming out there where they actually go into the economics behind it, where they go into the social aspects behind it.

02:01:04.630 --> 02:01:08.893
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's something I would put more along the line of Time Magazine's caliber.

02:01:09.393 --> 02:01:13.936
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the type of editorial I'd want to see out of Time Magazine in relation to video games, not a top 100 list.

02:01:15.681 --> 02:01:44.592
[SPEAKER_15]: Jonathan L with a good reply here on Facebook well they're all good but this one particularly caught my attention this seems it seems this is actually a list of games that were original for their time rather than a list of the all-time best the super NES library says hi the list also doesn't have any treasure games DS games arcade music games 3d sports games 3d fighting games MOBAs or any of the top 40 games on twitch TV right now therefore it is invalid World of Warcraft has to be in the top 40 of twitch TV

02:01:45.352 --> 02:01:46.993
[SPEAKER_15]: with all the arena matches that go on on there.

02:01:47.033 --> 02:01:49.313
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think you might have overlooked that one, but I get your point.

02:01:49.433 --> 02:01:50.414
[SPEAKER_16]: I hadn't even considered it.

02:01:50.494 --> 02:01:51.734
[SPEAKER_16]: DDR isn't a game on the list.

02:01:51.854 --> 02:01:54.075
[SPEAKER_16]: No, DDR was not on the list, but Guitar Hero was.

02:01:54.955 --> 02:01:55.135
[SPEAKER_16]: Huh.

02:01:55.155 --> 02:01:56.415
[SPEAKER_16]: I wonder if there's any relationship there.

02:01:56.495 --> 02:01:59.456
[SPEAKER_15]: Everyone knows that DDR ripped off Guitar Hero.

02:02:00.796 --> 02:02:01.597
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's the thing.

02:02:02.377 --> 02:02:08.058
[SPEAKER_15]: In America, I know this is hard for the longtime fans to hear, so just hold your breath for a minute.

02:02:08.098 --> 02:02:08.559
[SPEAKER_15]: Not too long.

02:02:08.599 --> 02:02:08.959
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't choke.

02:02:10.039 --> 02:02:13.460
[SPEAKER_15]: Guitar Hero made a bigger impact in the States than DDR did.

02:02:14.454 --> 02:02:14.854
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry.

02:02:14.954 --> 02:02:15.354
[SPEAKER_16]: No?

02:02:15.474 --> 02:02:15.794
[SPEAKER_16]: Gray?

02:02:16.295 --> 02:02:16.875
[SPEAKER_16]: Truth hurts.

02:02:17.175 --> 02:02:17.795
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, guys.

02:02:17.855 --> 02:02:21.016
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I won't deny the splash that it made.

02:02:21.036 --> 02:02:23.897
[SPEAKER_15]: Whether it should have or not is another argument.

02:02:24.037 --> 02:02:25.177
[SPEAKER_16]: And I won't argue that.

02:02:25.277 --> 02:02:28.658
[SPEAKER_16]: Guitar Hero 1 and 2 I had a hell of a lot of fun with.

02:02:28.778 --> 02:02:37.461
[SPEAKER_16]: It was, you know, being the Bimani kid all throughout the 98 release up until... Oh, when did Guitar Hero come out?

02:02:37.481 --> 02:02:39.062
[SPEAKER_16]: 07, I believe?

02:02:39.082 --> 02:02:39.422
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

02:02:40.362 --> 02:02:41.662
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for watching!

02:03:10.351 --> 02:03:14.375
[SPEAKER_16]: and Guitar Hero for less presentation, more performance.

02:03:14.895 --> 02:03:28.006
[SPEAKER_15]: I will say, though, to give to the other side of the coin, though, because I am a longtime DDR fan, one thing that should be acknowledged about Dance Dance Revolution that the Guitar Hero can't lay claim to is that none of these video games will you find in a PE class.

02:03:29.207 --> 02:03:31.870
[SPEAKER_15]: But DDR is the only game to have broken that barrier, so...

02:03:33.511 --> 02:03:34.812
[SPEAKER_15]: D.D.R.

02:03:34.872 --> 02:03:36.913
[SPEAKER_15]: and a P.E.

02:03:36.953 --> 02:03:38.294
[SPEAKER_15]: class is kind of a new thing.

02:03:38.694 --> 02:03:43.577
[SPEAKER_15]: Give it five or ten years and maybe we will have accepted it a little more as a culture.

02:03:43.757 --> 02:03:46.418
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe Minecraft will soon become sculpting class lessons.

02:03:46.438 --> 02:03:46.819
[SPEAKER_15]: Who knows?

02:03:46.999 --> 02:03:47.279
[SPEAKER_15]: Who knows?

02:03:47.559 --> 02:03:49.480
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, let me read like one more of these.

02:03:49.500 --> 02:03:53.343
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm so sorry I didn't get to everybody, but I want to read this one from Degenerate Johnny.

02:03:54.363 --> 02:03:58.886
[SPEAKER_15]: It appears to me that most of the mainstream media focuses on commercial successes or games with a cult following.

02:03:59.306 --> 02:04:03.569
[SPEAKER_15]: Since this is a top 100 list, it doesn't surprise me that Time did the same thing in this scenario.

02:04:03.989 --> 02:04:10.114
[SPEAKER_15]: The purpose of this list was not to inform us gamers, because this is something that we can expect from a generalized top 100 list.

02:04:10.534 --> 02:04:15.758
[SPEAKER_15]: This list was to inform the magazine's target market, which is clearly not us gamers.

02:04:16.138 --> 02:04:20.804
[SPEAKER_15]: Movie buffs don't care about top 100 movie lists from magazines such as Time and People.

02:04:21.104 --> 02:04:21.725
[SPEAKER_15]: Why should we?

02:04:22.125 --> 02:04:24.348
[SPEAKER_15]: Playboy features games in almost every issue.

02:04:24.688 --> 02:04:25.830
[SPEAKER_15]: Should we care about this?

02:04:26.290 --> 02:04:31.176
[SPEAKER_15]: Only if there's a centerfold of our favorite video game female characters, or male if you read Playgirl.

02:04:31.596 --> 02:04:33.659
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie, quit drooling over the centerfold of Garrus.

02:04:34.341 --> 02:04:34.661
[SPEAKER_16]: Really?

02:04:35.842 --> 02:04:37.624
[SPEAKER_16]: Gaming in every issue of Playboy?

02:04:37.804 --> 02:04:38.164
[SPEAKER_16]: Honestly?

02:04:38.584 --> 02:04:39.445
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm pretty sure they do.

02:04:39.585 --> 02:04:40.766
[SPEAKER_15]: It is a magazine for men.

02:04:40.946 --> 02:04:41.287
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

02:04:42.828 --> 02:04:43.188
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

02:04:44.009 --> 02:04:45.049
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just funny to think about.

02:04:45.069 --> 02:04:46.330
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not enough Turian in my life.

02:04:47.331 --> 02:04:53.936
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, before the weird turn that comment took in the second half, I'm so with you on the first half.

02:04:54.036 --> 02:04:54.317
[SPEAKER_15]: It was...

02:04:56.378 --> 02:05:00.343
[SPEAKER_15]: The mainstream media focuses on commercial successes or games of the cult following.

02:05:00.383 --> 02:05:02.205
[SPEAKER_15]: That is where this list really came from.

02:05:02.225 --> 02:05:04.768
[SPEAKER_07]: For the record, I have to say one thing real quick.

02:05:05.208 --> 02:05:06.149
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know what Cleverbot is?

02:05:07.631 --> 02:05:08.192
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that an AOL bot?

02:05:09.136 --> 02:05:09.536
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of.

02:05:09.596 --> 02:05:10.337
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually a website.

02:05:10.357 --> 02:05:11.638
[SPEAKER_07]: You type stuff in and it replies to you.

02:05:12.318 --> 02:05:15.360
[SPEAKER_07]: I typed in Turians and it replied, I am the very model of a scientist, Larian.

02:05:17.882 --> 02:05:18.282
[SPEAKER_07]: Just saying.

02:05:18.302 --> 02:05:20.263
[SPEAKER_15]: Because some nerd works at that website.

02:05:20.303 --> 02:05:20.803

[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there's portal ones on here too.

[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah!

02:05:45.014 --> 02:05:45.234
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah!

02:06:07.255 --> 02:06:09.677
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, I think you should go work for Nintendo.

02:06:10.037 --> 02:06:11.398
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, because I know what the internet is?

02:06:11.938 --> 02:06:15.060
[SPEAKER_13]: Instead of like, what is this internet you speak of?

02:06:15.500 --> 02:06:16.341
[SPEAKER_16]: You'd be surprised.

02:06:16.541 --> 02:06:16.961
[SPEAKER_13]: Why not?

02:06:18.822 --> 02:06:21.384
[SPEAKER_13]: We have to make screen name.

02:06:21.424 --> 02:06:26.707
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll attach it to the console and if their console breaks... Our consoles never break!

02:06:26.887 --> 02:06:27.007
[SPEAKER_13]: You...

02:06:28.268 --> 02:06:28.908
[SPEAKER_13]: Death to you!

02:06:28.968 --> 02:06:29.349
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

02:06:31.050 --> 02:06:31.690
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, Loki.

02:06:32.410 --> 02:06:33.191
[SPEAKER_13]: How about some real news?

02:06:33.971 --> 02:06:34.792
[SPEAKER_13]: Some real news?

02:06:34.992 --> 02:06:35.292
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

02:06:35.872 --> 02:06:37.453
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's talk about Black Ops 2.

02:06:37.513 --> 02:06:39.394
[SPEAKER_13]: Black Ops 2, big surprise.

02:06:39.475 --> 02:06:41.536
[SPEAKER_13]: Biggest title of the year.

02:06:42.176 --> 02:06:43.677
[SPEAKER_13]: It has broken all sorts of records.

02:06:44.257 --> 02:06:50.641
[SPEAKER_13]: Modern Warfare 3, of course, sold 6.5 million copies in the US and UK.

02:06:50.661 --> 02:06:55.704
[SPEAKER_13]: The previous record was $400 million in the first day.

02:06:56.084 --> 02:06:57.365
[SPEAKER_13]: Black Ops 2 beat that

02:06:57.845 --> 02:07:01.048
[SPEAKER_13]: with $500 million in the first day.

02:07:01.189 --> 02:07:08.116
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's a lot of game and the biggest entertainment launch in history.

02:07:09.901 --> 02:07:34.726
[SPEAKER_15]: so hooray and I'm sure next year you'll maybe beat your record again Modern Warfare 4 will break it Black Ops 3 will break it well if there's new consoles next year though that could throw an interesting monkey wrench in the situation nah because they'll make it for the other consoles as well that's true there'll be that little while where they're making it for everything cause there's a Wii U version no Wii version are they still making Playstation 2 versions nope

02:07:36.545 --> 02:07:37.766
[SPEAKER_16]: That stopped with World of War.

02:07:38.186 --> 02:07:45.248
[SPEAKER_16]: Not as of the big titles, but I was actually glancing over when you guys were doing release dates, and I do still see some new title PlayStation 2 versions.

02:07:45.268 --> 02:07:46.009
[SPEAKER_13]: Pro Evo.

02:07:47.109 --> 02:07:51.871
[SPEAKER_13]: Which is Pro Evo, just like the Wii version, and FIFA was just like the same thing.

02:07:52.211 --> 02:07:53.452
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are just rehashed versions.

02:07:53.632 --> 02:07:54.992
[SPEAKER_13]: They're there, just saying.

02:07:55.012 --> 02:07:57.133
[SPEAKER_13]: New PlayStation 2 titles, crazy to me.

02:07:57.253 --> 02:08:04.018
[SPEAKER_15]: To be fair though, didn't we discuss on a prior show that really the only PlayStation 2 game that's left to come out is the Final Fantasy XI expansion?

02:08:04.058 --> 02:08:05.579
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to say that came up in a prior show.

02:08:05.959 --> 02:08:07.961
[SPEAKER_15]: That like, here's what you have to look forward to in 2013.

02:08:09.522 --> 02:08:10.443
[SPEAKER_15]: One PlayStation 2 game.

02:08:11.243 --> 02:08:12.104
[SPEAKER_15]: XI expansion?

02:08:12.404 --> 02:08:12.704
[SPEAKER_15]: Mm-hmm.

02:08:13.245 --> 02:08:14.165
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, duh.

02:08:14.225 --> 02:08:14.526
[SPEAKER_13]: Never mind.

02:08:14.766 --> 02:08:14.886
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

02:08:15.791 --> 02:08:16.151
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

02:08:17.112 --> 02:08:18.853
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, lots of money.

02:08:20.014 --> 02:08:20.354
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

02:08:20.734 --> 02:08:23.456
[SPEAKER_15]: Moving on to LEGO Lord of the Rings.

02:08:23.556 --> 02:08:25.237
[SPEAKER_15]: I know some of y'all are excited about The Hobbit.

02:08:26.058 --> 02:08:29.100
[SPEAKER_15]: And so, of course, up comes all the new tie-in games with this.

02:08:29.480 --> 02:08:35.004
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's LEGO Lord of the Rings, which I guess, granted, LEGO is kind of its own little monster gaming series.

02:08:35.164 --> 02:08:40.567
[SPEAKER_15]: But regardless, the Xbox 360 version of this came out just this past week.

02:08:40.908 --> 02:08:42.268
[SPEAKER_15]: But here's something crazy.

02:08:43.402 --> 02:08:50.524
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess some demo discs, as opposed to retail game discs, got shipped out to retailers.

02:08:50.804 --> 02:08:51.124
[SPEAKER_13]: Not quite.

02:08:51.805 --> 02:08:52.225
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, really?

02:08:52.885 --> 02:08:59.147
[SPEAKER_13]: The retail discs actually got shipped out, but they were labeled as demo discs.

02:08:59.187 --> 02:09:02.608
[SPEAKER_13]: They weren't actually demo discs, it's just a demo copy on it.

02:09:02.768 --> 02:09:08.353
[SPEAKER_15]: But what a collector's item that is, because these stories are saying, quick, you better take them back and get them exchanged.

02:09:08.753 --> 02:09:09.774
[SPEAKER_15]: Hell no, you shouldn't.

02:09:09.834 --> 02:09:10.855
[SPEAKER_15]: Hang on to that thing.

02:09:10.895 --> 02:09:14.298
[SPEAKER_15]: That's going to be money to some collector.

02:09:14.559 --> 02:09:16.240
[SPEAKER_13]: It's only a small, it's not all of them.

02:09:16.380 --> 02:09:19.263
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, in fact, all the ones we got shipped were not like that.

02:09:19.803 --> 02:09:24.207
[SPEAKER_15]: Microsoft to Walmart, Target, and Toys R Us is the places you're going to find this.

02:09:24.347 --> 02:09:26.349
[SPEAKER_15]: So not mom pod distribution.

02:09:26.389 --> 02:09:26.850
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, Loki.

02:09:28.603 --> 02:09:29.703
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, I got my little big planet.

02:09:31.404 --> 02:09:33.725
[SPEAKER_15]: So, yeah, very interesting.

02:09:33.785 --> 02:09:35.966
[SPEAKER_15]: So they are doing an official recall.

02:09:36.266 --> 02:09:39.747
[SPEAKER_15]: You can contact WB Games either by email or by phone.

02:09:39.807 --> 02:09:45.549
[SPEAKER_15]: But at the same time, if the disc really is the game, then hooray, you have the game.

02:09:46.149 --> 02:09:51.191
[SPEAKER_15]: I say enjoy it and then keep that thing in good condition because a collector may want that someday.

02:09:51.451 --> 02:09:51.671
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe.

02:09:52.931 --> 02:09:53.231
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

02:10:11.520 --> 02:10:17.063
[SPEAKER_15]: or the competition cartridges from Nintendo World Championships.

02:10:17.804 --> 02:10:20.185
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I thought you were going to say the Blockbuster Championship thing.

02:10:20.205 --> 02:10:20.725
[SPEAKER_15]: Those too.

02:10:20.865 --> 02:10:23.206
[SPEAKER_15]: All those cartridges go for Buku Bucks too.

02:10:23.727 --> 02:10:24.967
[SPEAKER_15]: Miss Prince and shit.

02:10:25.328 --> 02:10:26.968
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, you collect old stuff.

02:10:27.008 --> 02:10:28.129
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a Monopoly.

02:10:29.570 --> 02:10:32.011
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, that's right, a Monopoly.

02:10:32.471 --> 02:10:33.992
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was on Genesis?

02:10:34.332 --> 02:10:35.273
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Master System.

02:10:35.833 --> 02:10:36.754
[SPEAKER_07]: I have two of them.

02:10:37.994 --> 02:10:39.135
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have an actual Monopoly.

02:10:41.283 --> 02:10:51.006
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, let's move on with some more, no, not more news Yes, more news, I'm kidding I'm not with it tonight, DarkSakura

02:10:52.577 --> 02:10:58.379
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, in other news, and I'm going to mispronounce the name of this game because I'm not sure exactly how it's said.

02:10:58.539 --> 02:11:00.459
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it Arm A?

02:11:00.499 --> 02:11:00.739
[SPEAKER_07]: Arm A3?

02:11:01.039 --> 02:11:01.259
[SPEAKER_07]: Arma?

02:11:01.540 --> 02:11:01.740
[SPEAKER_07]: Arma 3?

02:11:01.780 --> 02:11:01.980
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

02:11:02.140 --> 02:11:06.361
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's not a game I'm super interested in, but I'm pretty pissed off about the situation.

02:11:07.281 --> 02:11:20.505
[SPEAKER_07]: The developers, Ivan, I guess it's Busta, and Martin Peslar, have actually been held in jail for 70 days in Greece because they have been charged with espionage.

02:11:21.245 --> 02:11:21.986
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:11:45.247 --> 02:11:52.992
[SPEAKER_07]: The shooter itself was based on the island where they were arrested and they said that they were just there on holiday.

02:11:54.192 --> 02:11:57.674
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just a quote from Ivan's father.

02:11:58.034 --> 02:11:59.695
[SPEAKER_07]: They're in a cell with over 25 people.

02:11:59.755 --> 02:12:00.616
[SPEAKER_07]: They sleep on the ground.

02:12:00.636 --> 02:12:01.777
[SPEAKER_07]: They have food twice a day.

02:12:02.837 --> 02:12:06.359
[SPEAKER_07]: They no longer tell us on the phone that it's alright, that they're handling it.

02:12:06.959 --> 02:12:11.402
[SPEAKER_07]: After the court's decision, we only hear from them something no parent ever wants to hear.

02:12:11.482 --> 02:12:12.563
[SPEAKER_07]: Mom, Dad, please save us.

02:12:13.623 --> 02:12:22.288
[SPEAKER_07]: So, the people have been writing to the Czech president and prime minister saying that the foreign ministry hasn't been doing enough.

02:12:22.948 --> 02:12:27.831
[SPEAKER_07]: And the foreign ministry spokesperson says they're trying to work it from all angles and trying to help them out.

02:12:28.851 --> 02:12:31.193
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.

02:12:34.334 --> 02:12:36.115
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's an ongoing saga.

02:12:36.315 --> 02:12:39.777
[SPEAKER_15]: We heard about that before and they may be in there a little while, huh?

02:12:40.278 --> 02:12:40.978
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's hope not.

02:12:42.079 --> 02:12:43.661
[SPEAKER_15]: Skypline at 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Launch Radio on Skype

02:12:57.796 --> 02:13:12.642
[SPEAKER_13]: But OpenFaint, the kind of alternative to using Game Room, at least on the iOS platform, and, well, it was one of the only kind of multi-platform kind of hubs for even the Android marketplace.

02:13:12.682 --> 02:13:19.465
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you may remember Gris purchased OpenFaint, its parent company, back in April 2011.

02:13:19.525 --> 02:13:19.765
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, now...

02:13:21.946 --> 02:13:24.267
[SPEAKER_13]: OpenFaint is going to be shut down.

02:13:24.708 --> 02:13:29.150
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're shutting down the service starting, well, actually effective December 14th.

02:13:29.591 --> 02:13:35.534
[SPEAKER_13]: And in its place is going to be Grease platform that they have, which I've not experienced yet.

02:13:36.234 --> 02:13:39.396
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what's funny is this is what I was teasing about before the break.

02:13:39.836 --> 02:13:42.438
[SPEAKER_15]: One of our listeners, Picaruno, he always does these little live blogs.

02:13:42.498 --> 02:13:43.458
[SPEAKER_15]: He's listening to the show.

02:13:43.819 --> 02:13:45.380
[SPEAKER_15]: And he was listening to the podcast today.

02:13:46.100 --> 02:13:51.103
[SPEAKER_15]: And he said about the show, Ha ha, you just mentioned OpenFaint not going out of business.

02:13:51.503 --> 02:13:52.624
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:14:20.184 --> 02:14:26.226
[SPEAKER_16]: Early days of these networks really coming out, Aurora Faint turned into Open Faint and it was just a runaway hit.

02:14:26.946 --> 02:14:28.327
[SPEAKER_16]: Wasn't Aurora Faint the game?

02:14:28.347 --> 02:14:30.247
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:14:30.327 --> 02:14:38.390
[SPEAKER_16]: Aurora Faint had its little social hub network within game and whenever they started... That was a huge game in the early days of iOS.

02:14:38.430 --> 02:14:44.733
[SPEAKER_16]: And whenever they opened their network, their platform to other people is how it became Open Faint that others could use.

02:14:44.833 --> 02:14:45.693
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, Open Faint...

02:14:46.113 --> 02:14:48.715
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:15:12.062 --> 02:15:13.144
[SPEAKER_15]: Copyright Work Tattoos

02:15:27.463 --> 02:15:33.546
[SPEAKER_15]: So a tattoo artist has sued THQ, and if there's one company that can't afford a lawsuit right now, it's THQ.

02:15:34.006 --> 02:15:42.410
[SPEAKER_15]: But a tattoo artist sued THQ over some tattoo art that is seen in UFC Undisputed 2010 and UFC Undisputed 3.

02:15:42.510 --> 02:15:56.057
[SPEAKER_15]: The tattoo artist is named Chris Escobedo, and he filed a lawsuit against THQ because of a tattoo that he has copyrighted that is on MMA fighter Carlos Condit.

02:15:56.637 --> 02:15:57.938
[SPEAKER_15]: in these UFC games.

02:15:58.479 --> 02:16:07.686
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, his argument says that even though his tattoo is on this public figure, the tattoo's design still belongs to him.

02:16:08.106 --> 02:16:09.427
[SPEAKER_15]: He created it originally.

02:16:09.748 --> 02:16:12.790
[SPEAKER_15]: He never signed the rights to the design away to Condon.

02:16:13.130 --> 02:16:24.419
[SPEAKER_15]: So by digitally recreating the design, which THQ did, THQ is said to have, in this lawsuit, violated Escobedo's copyright on the work.

02:16:25.180 --> 02:16:25.380
[SPEAKER_15]: Jesus.

02:16:25.400 --> 02:16:25.520
[SPEAKER_15]: Jesus.

02:16:53.544 --> 02:16:58.889
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got a legal point, but honestly, this is just being selfish and greedy.

02:16:59.750 --> 02:17:01.472
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, maybe he's got bills that need to be paid.

02:17:01.512 --> 02:17:03.334
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

02:17:03.894 --> 02:17:09.740
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, if I did a design, you know, that's... Now, if it's something that...

02:17:11.653 --> 02:17:31.506
[SPEAKER_07]: wasn't being worn on a human body like if it was like say a banner or something or some like actual artwork that I put up you know as something on display and they use that like as a logo or something you specifically with the intention of making money off of it

02:17:32.125 --> 02:17:38.190
[SPEAKER_07]: All they did was recreate a likeness and the guy licensed his likeness, which includes everything attached to his likeness.

02:17:51.721 --> 02:17:53.562
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:18:19.640 --> 02:18:24.625
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's not a copyright filed on it, this guy has no ground to stand on.

02:18:26.407 --> 02:18:30.271
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I think it's this guy's private business.

02:18:30.751 --> 02:18:37.678
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that any tattoo artist, unless they're an independent contractor, license over their work to the studio they do the work for.

02:18:38.255 --> 02:18:43.902
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, I want to get to your thoughts too as well as Jason if he has any but I'm going to the chat room because this is the exact same thing I thought of.

02:18:44.303 --> 02:18:50.430
[SPEAKER_15]: Duke Newcomb at live.vognetwork.com says, didn't the same kind of thing happen with the Tyson tattoo in the Hangover Part 2?

02:18:50.490 --> 02:18:51.792
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe it did.

02:18:51.852 --> 02:18:56.438
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the exact same thing I thought of is that they had to go like digitally redo that guy.

02:18:56.938 --> 02:18:57.579
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, your thoughts?

02:18:57.659 --> 02:19:02.120
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I was just going to say, I don't think it's anything that... Can you even do that?

02:19:02.160 --> 02:19:12.184
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, because if you think about it, you have this copyright thing, so he can't make any public appearances anywhere because if he's captured on camera, oh, it's a copyright violation.

02:19:12.224 --> 02:19:15.385
[SPEAKER_13]: That seems a little stupid, like if you're putting it on somebody.

02:19:15.485 --> 02:19:24.507
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, if it was something blatant, like he had him tattoo Nintendo's logo on his face or something like that, then that's a little kind of... What about that guy who got the Romney tattoo?

02:19:24.527 --> 02:19:25.988
[SPEAKER_15]: It was all over the internet this week.

02:19:26.408 --> 02:19:28.810
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually checking with one of my favorite sites ever, Freakonomics.

02:19:29.470 --> 02:19:30.591
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Freakonomics.

02:19:33.072 --> 02:19:40.497
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're going over that case you're talking about, The Hangover Part 2, about the art appearing without the artist's consent.

02:19:43.259 --> 02:19:43.519
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

02:19:44.980 --> 02:19:46.741
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to read this paragraph here.

02:19:47.341 --> 02:19:47.461
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

02:20:08.989 --> 02:20:32.790
[SPEAKER_07]: and then so they're basically using it as that now they're asking does Warner Brothers have a way out the studio may claim that the tattoo is not original that it was inspired by Maori tattoos this is unlikely to work copyrights originality threshold is very low even if Whitmill adapted his design from one in the public domain it will nonetheless be copyrightable if not copied exactly if it is not copied exactly

02:20:33.922 --> 02:20:35.806
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, before we move on to the mailbag, anything?

02:20:36.427 --> 02:20:36.848
[SPEAKER_07]: One last thing.

02:20:37.630 --> 02:20:41.618
[SPEAKER_07]: They say that it is also, though, quite likely protected under the Fair Use Doctrine.

02:20:43.794 --> 02:20:45.655
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, interesting.

02:20:45.875 --> 02:20:48.016
[SPEAKER_16]: I voted for Freakonomics on Podcast Awards.

02:20:49.757 --> 02:20:50.897
[SPEAKER_16]: Best one in their category that I saw.

02:20:51.037 --> 02:20:54.218
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually had the Freakonomics desk calendar.

02:20:54.358 --> 02:20:56.900
[SPEAKER_07]: I used it for three years.

02:20:56.960 --> 02:20:57.780
[SPEAKER_07]: I would get it every year.

02:20:58.560 --> 02:21:00.281
[SPEAKER_07]: You learn a lot from this website.

02:21:00.821 --> 02:21:01.521
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, just saying.

02:21:01.861 --> 02:21:03.602
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, that came from Freakonomics.com.

02:21:04.423 --> 02:21:05.523
[SPEAKER_07]: Copyright, blah, blah.

02:21:08.179 --> 02:21:09.400
[SPEAKER_16]: I was going to ask the same question.

02:21:09.440 --> 02:21:18.528
[SPEAKER_16]: Why isn't this an issue on especially pay-per-view, mixed martial arts, pay-per-view UFC broadcasts?

02:21:18.648 --> 02:21:22.991
[SPEAKER_16]: Licensing, God only knows what happens behind the scenes, but I'm surprised that this hasn't come up before.

02:21:24.513 --> 02:21:25.453
[SPEAKER_16]: Scary situation.

02:21:25.493 --> 02:21:25.674
[SPEAKER_16]: The

02:21:26.694 --> 02:21:37.002
[SPEAKER_16]: Before having known those details, I was going to say flat out that this is Carlos Condit's problems and he's on the hook for this problem for any license agreement broken or otherwise.

02:21:37.442 --> 02:21:39.564
[SPEAKER_15]: I kind of agree with you.

02:21:39.824 --> 02:21:44.888
[SPEAKER_15]: Before you get a piece of art permanently put on your body, you better think about who owns that art.

02:21:45.008 --> 02:21:50.252
[SPEAKER_16]: At the same time, you want to say original or not, it's a tattoo and it's there.

02:21:50.612 --> 02:21:52.993
[SPEAKER_15]: Unless you're getting it on your butt where no one will ever see it.

02:21:53.633 --> 02:21:54.593
[SPEAKER_16]: But special people.

02:21:54.794 --> 02:21:57.294
[SPEAKER_16]: Clearly not the case in this situation, but of course.

02:21:57.875 --> 02:22:01.536
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that's a really crappy situation.

02:22:02.476 --> 02:22:05.377
[SPEAKER_16]: Not having the expertise, I don't really want to comment anymore, but that's a scary thought.

02:22:05.417 --> 02:22:07.018
[SPEAKER_07]: I do still think it's a case of money grabbing.

02:22:07.418 --> 02:22:12.921
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm gonna get the copyright Mike Tyson tattoo on my butt and no one will ever know and I'll get away with a crime.

02:22:14.282 --> 02:22:20.926
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what's gonna happen is that THQ, somebody is gonna shell out damages and there's gonna be a patch that's gonna be devoted to removing this in-game.

02:22:21.106 --> 02:22:21.466
[SPEAKER_16]: Period.

02:22:22.006 --> 02:22:22.707
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the era we live in.

02:22:22.727 --> 02:22:27.109
[SPEAKER_07]: Either that or it's gonna be a patch that adds in a special copyright notice.

02:22:27.489 --> 02:22:31.352
[SPEAKER_15]: Or licensed from... A 1K patch with text alterations.

02:22:31.372 --> 02:22:35.554
[SPEAKER_15]: This is all time that THQ could spend working on something to make them money.

02:22:36.644 --> 02:22:43.768
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura has asked me to dive into the mailbag tonight And I said, sure, why not I'll get my hands dirty

02:22:54.833 --> 02:22:58.738
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:23:10.393 --> 02:23:10.913
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura.com

02:23:34.230 --> 02:23:39.415
[SPEAKER_15]: Neither do I experience this issue with any other DVDs or CDs I've put into the DVD drive recently.

02:23:39.915 --> 02:23:43.158
[SPEAKER_15]: Only Assassin's Creed 3 on Xbox 360 has given me this problem.

02:23:43.578 --> 02:23:45.960
[SPEAKER_15]: My 360 is unmodded, so that's not the problem.

02:23:46.501 --> 02:23:51.846
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, the Assassin's Creed 3 game disc does not appear to be broken, scratched, warped, chipped, or otherwise damaged.

02:23:52.466 --> 02:23:56.247
[SPEAKER_15]: I've tried searching around online and can't find anyone else experiencing this problem.

02:23:56.727 --> 02:23:59.448
[SPEAKER_15]: Or at least no one online is bitching about this problem.

02:23:59.869 --> 02:24:04.830
[SPEAKER_15]: Am I an anomaly or is anyone else experiencing this problem with Assassin's Creed 3 under 360?

02:24:05.671 --> 02:24:06.931
[SPEAKER_15]: Stay black, Redertainment.

02:24:08.240 --> 02:24:09.001
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:24:28.939 --> 02:24:30.000
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:24:49.355 --> 02:24:54.681
[SPEAKER_15]: If you have the ability to do so, I would just install the game to your drive to be safe.

02:24:55.021 --> 02:24:59.986
[SPEAKER_15]: Granted, you still need the game to boot the file, but I think you'll have a little more luck there.

02:25:00.927 --> 02:25:03.891
[SPEAKER_15]: Otherwise, I would clean the disc anyway.

02:25:04.992 --> 02:25:08.355
[SPEAKER_15]: You might not be able to see it, and clearly you've already established it's not your 360.

02:25:08.395 --> 02:25:08.676
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the disc.

02:25:12.388 --> 02:25:14.471
[SPEAKER_15]: and I don't own Assassin's Creed 3 so it was another game.

02:25:14.491 --> 02:25:17.274
[SPEAKER_13]: Try the disc in another person's system to see if it's actually the disc.

02:25:17.374 --> 02:25:21.679
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually want to say it was Mass Effect 2 because I bought that used and I think I had that problem.

02:25:21.699 --> 02:25:23.381
[SPEAKER_13]: Mass Effect 2 is fucking up all the games.

02:25:23.441 --> 02:25:24.062
[SPEAKER_13]: Seriously.

02:25:25.844 --> 02:25:30.889
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pissed off at my Mass Effect 2 because I have the version that it does with a launcher and now I can't use text mod at the end.

02:25:31.070 --> 02:25:31.310
[SPEAKER_15]: Dope.

02:25:32.423 --> 02:25:36.806
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, let's go to an email from Ramaditya from Indonesia.

02:25:37.627 --> 02:25:39.588
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi guys, it's Ramaditya from Indonesia.

02:25:40.148 --> 02:25:42.230
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if you've already known about this.

02:25:42.430 --> 02:25:46.532
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe you're familiar with an NES game called Blaster Master from Sunsoft.

02:25:46.753 --> 02:25:47.093
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yes.

02:25:47.753 --> 02:25:48.814
[SPEAKER_15]: One of my all-time favorites.

02:25:50.415 --> 02:25:50.835
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

02:25:50.875 --> 02:25:54.077
[SPEAKER_15]: In fact, now that you brought it up, see, now I have to.

02:25:54.758 --> 02:25:55.538
[SPEAKER_15]: Now I have to.

02:25:56.659 --> 02:26:00.262
[SPEAKER_15]: You brought it up, so now I have to dig through the folder.

02:26:00.302 --> 02:26:01.943
[SPEAKER_07]: That means the song will be stuck in my head.

02:26:03.153 --> 02:26:03.538
[SPEAKER_15]: Here you go.

02:26:10.464 --> 02:26:10.984
[SPEAKER_15]: Much better.

02:26:11.745 --> 02:26:14.086
[SPEAKER_15]: In fact, it was one of my favorite games when I was a child.

02:26:14.587 --> 02:26:19.530
[SPEAKER_15]: Several days ago, I found out the info about the hack version of Blaster Master.

02:26:20.010 --> 02:26:23.613
[SPEAKER_15]: The patch allows you to play eight completely different levels from the game.

02:26:24.093 --> 02:26:31.378
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I cannot see, so it's impossible to tell you how good or bad it is, but my girlfriend, the one that tried the game, informed me it was great.

02:26:31.858 --> 02:26:40.024
[SPEAKER_15]: To know more about it, please visit the link below, and he has a link to Zofar.net, which I... My first reaction was, that site's still around?

02:26:41.045 --> 02:26:44.088
[SPEAKER_15]: I remember hanging out in IRC chat rooms that Zophar was in.

02:26:44.108 --> 02:26:44.929
[SPEAKER_15]: That was years ago.

02:26:44.969 --> 02:26:46.230
[SPEAKER_15]: I was in college then, okay?

02:26:46.390 --> 02:26:50.795
[SPEAKER_16]: Last I knew, Zophar was ad-bombed and scary as a result to go to it.

02:26:50.895 --> 02:26:52.477
[SPEAKER_15]: Zophar's gotta be my age.

02:26:53.357 --> 02:26:53.838
[SPEAKER_15]: At least.

02:26:54.258 --> 02:26:55.860
[SPEAKER_15]: He's mid-thirties, for sure.

02:26:56.040 --> 02:26:57.862
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. International House of Roms.

02:26:58.242 --> 02:26:58.463
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck.

02:26:59.023 --> 02:27:02.666
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyhow, to know more about it, please visit the link below.

02:27:02.686 --> 02:27:05.488
[SPEAKER_15]: It has the info, the game trailer, and the patch itself.

02:27:05.568 --> 02:27:07.450
[SPEAKER_15]: So hope it blasts your day.

02:27:07.870 --> 02:27:14.455
[SPEAKER_15]: Now the link here is kind of lengthy, so I'll just tell you to go to Zophar at Z-O-P-H-A-R.net if you didn't already know.

02:27:14.875 --> 02:27:16.856
[SPEAKER_15]: and look for Blaster Remaster.

02:27:17.476 --> 02:27:21.077
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of people in the emulation scene did this shit with Mario Brothers.

02:27:21.297 --> 02:27:22.157
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't tell you.

02:27:22.237 --> 02:27:33.501
[SPEAKER_15]: When hacking and sprite changing, when Nesticle implemented, and yes, that's what it was called, when Nesticle implemented the sprite changing abilities, Super Penis Brothers was out within minutes.

02:27:34.541 --> 02:27:36.742
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody did basic hacks to the game.

02:27:37.236 --> 02:27:41.739
[SPEAKER_15]: But they got more and more and more in depth and now you've got all these level changes.

02:27:41.939 --> 02:27:46.242
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you ever remember the Metroid level editor that they made?

02:27:46.622 --> 02:27:46.942
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah.

02:27:47.403 --> 02:27:55.488
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's actually several now whole new versions of Metroid, classic Metroid, that different layouts and everything that are really well done.

02:27:56.431 --> 02:27:57.852
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, thank you for a blast from the past.

02:27:57.912 --> 02:28:02.374
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe it'll be better than that Wii version they did some time ago.

02:28:03.034 --> 02:28:03.474
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.

02:28:03.554 --> 02:28:05.015
[SPEAKER_15]: Ramaditya from Indonesia.

02:28:05.255 --> 02:28:06.776
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd love being an international show.

02:28:07.936 --> 02:28:08.897
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, moving on.

02:28:09.577 --> 02:28:09.977
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see.

02:28:10.458 --> 02:28:12.979
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's a cheap plug from Travis H.

02:28:13.699 --> 02:28:17.181
[SPEAKER_15]: This is worth mentioning because it has to do with our old favorite pastime.

02:28:17.522 --> 02:28:19.063
[SPEAKER_15]: Travis H sent us a plug here.

02:28:19.743 --> 02:28:25.607
[SPEAKER_15]: I will attempt the DDR marathon record again on November 23rd at 5 a.m.

02:28:25.727 --> 02:28:28.449
[SPEAKER_15]: Eastern to November 24th to 9 p.m.

02:28:28.529 --> 02:28:31.251
[SPEAKER_15]: Eastern, but this time on doubles play.

02:28:33.052 --> 02:28:40.137
[SPEAKER_15]: He links to an event on Facebook and something called CrowdRise.com slash DDR World Record.

02:28:40.637 --> 02:28:42.058
[SPEAKER_15]: So he's doing the record.

02:28:42.599 --> 02:28:43.219
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it for charity?

02:28:43.239 --> 02:28:43.840
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what I want to know.

02:28:43.860 --> 02:28:45.321
[SPEAKER_15]: He's going to do it in Knoxville, Tennessee.

02:28:46.502 --> 02:28:47.022
[SPEAKER_15]: Ah, here we go.

02:28:47.342 --> 02:28:48.163
[SPEAKER_15]: It is for charity.

02:28:48.203 --> 02:28:50.725
[SPEAKER_15]: He raised $1,000 for local charity through the event.

02:28:51.045 --> 02:28:53.127
[SPEAKER_15]: He wants to double his results this year.

02:28:53.627 --> 02:28:55.729
[SPEAKER_15]: Rescue Ministries Meals.

02:28:56.209 --> 02:28:58.711
[SPEAKER_15]: I will be pledging two meals per one hour that I compete.

02:28:59.051 --> 02:29:01.074
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, at least it's for a good cause at the end of the day.

02:29:01.515 --> 02:29:08.524
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I'm all for everybody trying to one-up each other on these marathons and Guinness Book of World Records and stuff when it's for charity.

02:29:08.645 --> 02:29:09.346
[SPEAKER_15]: So, good on you.

02:29:09.666 --> 02:29:11.929
[SPEAKER_15]: Speaking of charity, am I not correct?

02:29:11.969 --> 02:29:14.333
[SPEAKER_15]: Desert Bus started again this weekend.

02:29:14.453 --> 02:29:14.673
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

02:29:16.260 --> 02:29:17.061
[SPEAKER_15]: Desert Bust is going.

02:29:17.161 --> 02:29:18.501
[SPEAKER_15]: Umlaut's coming up, of course.

02:29:18.541 --> 02:29:20.223
[SPEAKER_15]: You've heard Jamie talking about that.

02:29:21.023 --> 02:29:22.444
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still working on badges.

02:29:23.204 --> 02:29:24.986
[SPEAKER_15]: It's that time of year for child's play.

02:29:26.026 --> 02:29:29.448
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, I want to let you know that I was watching some Guinness World Records stuff.

02:29:29.789 --> 02:29:31.310
[SPEAKER_07]: They fit 28 women into a mini.

02:29:32.710 --> 02:29:33.011
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

02:29:33.531 --> 02:29:33.751
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

02:29:33.791 --> 02:29:36.373
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, why do people think that this is record worthy?

02:29:37.273 --> 02:29:40.475
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and the longest note on a didgeridoo was won by a 14-year-old.

02:29:41.036 --> 02:29:41.396
[SPEAKER_07]: Just saying.

02:29:42.990 --> 02:29:44.071
[SPEAKER_15]: I miss didgeridoos.

02:29:46.353 --> 02:29:47.734
[SPEAKER_15]: I miss techno didgeridoo.

02:29:47.774 --> 02:29:48.274
[SPEAKER_15]: Remember that?

02:29:48.334 --> 02:29:49.796
[SPEAKER_15]: That was a thing on OLR years ago.

02:29:50.796 --> 02:29:52.918
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to bring up the didgeridoo for that.

02:29:53.178 --> 02:29:53.479
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

02:29:53.779 --> 02:29:55.981
[SPEAKER_16]: Quick charity is something that's interesting.

02:29:56.001 --> 02:30:04.227
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, the reason I mentioned that I've been out here in California for over a week, and I wasn't on last week's show because my employer held a dodgeball charity tournament.

02:30:05.408 --> 02:30:09.672
[SPEAKER_16]: It was basically a who's who of the startups and Silicon Valley startups

02:30:10.052 --> 02:30:13.662
[SPEAKER_16]: mostly San Francisco area competitors and it was a whole hell of a lot of fun.

02:30:14.665 --> 02:30:17.472
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe it was $60,000 for local San Francisco charities.

02:30:17.633 --> 02:30:17.853
[SPEAKER_16]: It was...

02:30:19.626 --> 02:30:22.727
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, Dodgeball, what experience do we have from Dodgeball?

02:30:23.588 --> 02:30:26.048
[SPEAKER_16]: The NES version that was amazing and Jim.

02:30:26.749 --> 02:30:28.869
[SPEAKER_16]: And this was, there were 20 teams.

02:30:28.949 --> 02:30:32.170
[SPEAKER_16]: It was a Neo Geo game too, which was amazing.

02:30:33.211 --> 02:30:37.532
[SPEAKER_16]: 20 teams across 17 businesses.

02:30:38.292 --> 02:30:39.373
[SPEAKER_16]: A whole day's worth of fun.

02:30:39.473 --> 02:30:40.453
[SPEAKER_16]: It was amazing.

02:30:40.693 --> 02:30:44.134
[SPEAKER_16]: And even the World Dodgeball Society came out to officiate it and everything.

02:30:44.514 --> 02:30:45.375
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a great time.

02:30:46.275 --> 02:30:52.421
[SPEAKER_15]: Dodgeball was a fun game, that was one of my favorites growing up Absolutely Alright, you ready to get taken back with this inside joke?

02:30:52.982 --> 02:30:54.944
We're all dancing I want the DDR guy to dance to that

02:31:09.978 --> 02:31:12.487
[SPEAKER_15]: If I'm ever a wrestler, that's the music I'm coming out to.

02:31:13.310 --> 02:31:15.818
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, last email tonight from Elliot B.

02:31:17.028 --> 02:31:19.289
[SPEAKER_15]: Dear OLR, just a quick email here.

02:31:19.709 --> 02:31:26.010
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to celebrate the fact that yesterday was the 10th anniversary of Metroid Prime, my personal favorite game ever.

02:31:26.150 --> 02:31:26.470
[SPEAKER_15]: Really?

02:31:26.791 --> 02:31:27.171
[SPEAKER_15]: 10 years?

02:31:28.071 --> 02:31:28.571
[SPEAKER_15]: Jesus.

02:31:29.131 --> 02:31:32.332
[SPEAKER_15]: I played it again a few weeks ago and it's barely aged a day.

02:31:32.712 --> 02:31:36.113
[SPEAKER_15]: The controls are pitch perfect and the graphics still look good.

02:31:36.533 --> 02:31:41.234
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's hoping the series gets resurrected sometime soon after Metroid Other M's Kiss of Death.

02:31:44.275 --> 02:31:50.158
[SPEAKER_15]: Elliot B. I had no idea that series was 10 years old, but it makes perfect sense.

02:31:50.458 --> 02:32:03.784
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, if Virtual Console on Wii U were to start making GameCube games show up, which isn't outside the realm of possibility, Metroid Prime would sure be a prime candidate to kick things off.

02:32:08.860 --> 02:32:26.060
[SPEAKER_15]: Elliot's regretting that he sent that email right now Anyhow, that's it for emails this week Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com A few more stories for you guys Can we be having the Metroid primaries?

02:32:29.605 --> 02:32:31.428
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, he's really regretting sending that email.

02:32:31.448 --> 02:32:35.554
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, we're going to have an empty mailbag again next week, and we're going to say, why isn't anybody emailing us?

02:32:35.694 --> 02:32:37.737
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah, because we always tell the stupidest jokes.

02:32:37.817 --> 02:32:40.080
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

02:32:40.400 --> 02:32:42.704
[SPEAKER_15]: Now would be an appropriate time to do the FUs of the week.

02:32:59.384 --> 02:33:15.059
[SPEAKER_07]: FU's of the week, DarkSakura FU to me not having a cat I really want a cat My husband says that we can't get a cat until we buy a house So you better hurry up and buy me a house so I can get a cat The end

02:33:17.608 --> 02:33:21.569
[SPEAKER_13]: F you to the utter lack of self-control that I have and my credit card bill next month.

02:33:48.194 --> 02:33:51.316
[SPEAKER_15]: but yay to those reward points.

02:33:51.396 --> 02:33:51.757
[SPEAKER_16]: Jason.

02:33:54.799 --> 02:33:58.482
[SPEAKER_16]: FU to not having a car because we're down to one and Brian actually has to drive to work.

02:33:59.983 --> 02:34:04.366
[SPEAKER_16]: FU to Wells Fargo for reasons that I don't really need to go into but are probably completely obvious.

02:34:04.606 --> 02:34:06.888
[SPEAKER_16]: I can guess based on the FU, yeah.

02:34:06.948 --> 02:34:10.350
[SPEAKER_16]: And related to that, FU to $2 keyboards and $50 computers.

02:34:10.450 --> 02:34:16.355
[SPEAKER_16]: There's, you know, people, places like Wells Fargo that have to buy these cheap-ass little computers because everything just runs on a web browser.

02:34:16.795 --> 02:34:17.896
[SPEAKER_16]: I hate those keyboards.

02:34:18.036 --> 02:34:30.181
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if it's just ingrained to me because I've always worked desk computer keyboard jobs, but holy crap, you have a crappy keyboard and computers become an impossible thing.

02:34:31.602 --> 02:34:40.026
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh man, I did not realize that that's ever something they would say to me.

02:34:40.066 --> 02:34:45.809
[SPEAKER_16]: There's this bridge near Berkeley, north of the Bay Bridge, an overpass rather, north of the Bay Bridge,

02:34:46.549 --> 02:34:52.033
[SPEAKER_16]: And every time I've been out here and come up towards Sacramento, there's a sign up there, Investigate 9-11, Stop the War.

02:34:52.333 --> 02:34:54.594
[SPEAKER_16]: I get the sentiment, but you're still up there.

02:34:54.815 --> 02:34:55.475
[SPEAKER_16]: It's Berkeley.

02:34:56.255 --> 02:34:56.916
[SPEAKER_16]: Just, wow.

02:34:57.056 --> 02:34:58.557
[SPEAKER_07]: Berserkly.

02:35:00.118 --> 02:35:04.141
[SPEAKER_15]: And related to that, FU to... We love Berkeley, but they bring the crazy.

02:35:04.321 --> 02:35:05.301
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's why we love them.

02:35:05.341 --> 02:35:07.303
[SPEAKER_15]: We need a little unpredictability in our life.

02:35:07.423 --> 02:35:13.206
[SPEAKER_16]: And related to that, FU to the coney burned and carved into the hillside that I saw going up here.

02:35:13.687 --> 02:35:15.508
[SPEAKER_15]: How many votes did he end up getting for president?

02:35:18.368 --> 02:35:20.610
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow, what?

02:35:21.191 --> 02:35:23.132
[SPEAKER_16]: Was he on the Colorado ballot like I was talking about?

02:35:23.152 --> 02:35:23.933
[SPEAKER_16]: He might have been.

02:35:23.953 --> 02:35:25.234
[SPEAKER_16]: Did I miss something?

02:35:25.274 --> 02:35:26.715
[SPEAKER_15]: You haven't heard that joke?

02:35:26.775 --> 02:35:30.238
[SPEAKER_15]: I just told the same joke that went around Twitter all day after election.

02:35:30.799 --> 02:35:34.802
[SPEAKER_15]: With all the bumper stickers on cars, how many votes did he get in the election?

02:35:34.862 --> 02:35:36.163
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow, it's actually pretty good.

02:35:37.584 --> 02:35:39.286
[SPEAKER_16]: F you to me for being out of the scene.

02:35:40.748 --> 02:35:49.897
[SPEAKER_16]: Lastly, F you to the Wii U for sometimes just not having button shortcuts, so you have to let go of the controller, tap on the gamepad screen, and just...

02:35:52.599 --> 02:35:55.742
[SPEAKER_16]: It, I'm sure, will be patched, but it's just, it feels weird sometimes.

02:35:55.762 --> 02:35:59.024
[SPEAKER_15]: That's one of those doors that goes into a room where, surprise, it's nothing.

02:35:59.064 --> 02:36:01.586
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't wait for the next 5 gigabyte patch that I'll have.

02:36:02.267 --> 02:36:09.753
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, you owners that have the 8 gigabyte model, you're just not going to be able to have the shortcuts because it's another 5 gigabytes.

02:36:09.773 --> 02:36:10.153
[SPEAKER_13]: Good enough.

02:36:11.987 --> 02:36:14.170
[SPEAKER_15]: I still don't understand.

02:36:14.530 --> 02:36:15.091
[SPEAKER_15]: Me-verse.

02:36:15.351 --> 02:36:18.094
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't just make a post to show all my friends.

02:36:18.214 --> 02:36:28.165
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to post in the... If I want to show my cat, I've got to go to the Mass Effect 3 community and say, Hey, Mass Effect 3 community, I just want to post a picture of my cat.

02:36:28.706 --> 02:36:32.010
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you really want a public Nintendo-operated Twitter clone, though?

02:36:33.693 --> 02:36:44.105
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, well, well, well, it offers me something that Twitter doesn't, and that is hand-drawn stylus messages.

02:36:44.706 --> 02:36:53.336
[SPEAKER_13]: It sounds to me that this whole Miiverse thing is going to kind of devolve into some sort of GameFAQs forum thing.

02:36:54.560 --> 02:37:10.435
[SPEAKER_15]: to be fair it works better than the Vita's thing which I still like I don't like you know the Vita has that whole thing like you can see like what your friends are doing and you can even comment on posts nobody fucking knows it's there you probably don't even know what I'm talking about it's under the achieve

02:37:10.435 --> 02:37:12.417
[SPEAKER_13]: Achievements, create a trophy screen.

02:37:12.497 --> 02:37:18.363
[SPEAKER_15]: No, when you go into the games, you hit the little thing that says down and it shows you the feed like so-and-so just got this game.

02:37:18.704 --> 02:37:20.045
[SPEAKER_15]: So-and-so unlocked a trophy.

02:37:20.165 --> 02:37:23.769
[SPEAKER_15]: And you can actually like or whatever the PlayStation version of like is.

02:37:24.089 --> 02:37:30.196
[SPEAKER_15]: You can like posts and comment and all that shit like it was Facebook, but ain't nobody reading it.

02:37:31.377 --> 02:37:33.318
[SPEAKER_15]: because it's integrated, very shitty.

02:37:33.998 --> 02:37:36.919
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I'm going to go into each individual game I own to look at the feed.

02:37:36.999 --> 02:37:43.722
[SPEAKER_15]: Like that should be, to Nintendo's credit, at least that's the thing that comes up when I turn my Nintendo on.

02:37:44.457 --> 02:37:44.917
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for watching!

02:38:05.191 --> 02:38:09.075
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, Tigerclaw sent me a link saying, are you sure you want this to happen?

02:38:09.135 --> 02:38:14.421
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, of course, you know, ta-da, it's a penis drawn on the Wii U. What a shock.

02:38:14.941 --> 02:38:15.402
[SPEAKER_15]: A series of them.

02:38:15.422 --> 02:38:16.923
[SPEAKER_15]: That looks like multiple penises, actually.

02:38:16.943 --> 02:38:17.464
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a lot.

02:38:17.504 --> 02:38:18.865
[SPEAKER_15]: That is, they're upside down.

02:38:18.905 --> 02:38:19.346
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

02:38:19.386 --> 02:38:20.627
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the banner of dick.

02:38:20.867 --> 02:38:26.233
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just, it's a drawing of an alien planet where mushrooms grow from the ceiling.

02:38:26.413 --> 02:38:27.033
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what it is.

02:38:28.214 --> 02:38:29.675
[SPEAKER_07]: I still call it the banner of dick.

02:38:30.316 --> 02:38:32.277
[SPEAKER_13]: There are cave formations that do look like this.

02:38:32.317 --> 02:38:34.338
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's funny that it's under archery and swordplay.

02:38:41.362 --> 02:38:43.763
[SPEAKER_16]: Well played.

02:38:43.783 --> 02:38:46.225
[SPEAKER_16]: Does that make the TTP two hours and 45 minutes?

02:38:51.227 --> 02:38:53.529
[SPEAKER_13]: This is just one of those shows.

02:38:53.629 --> 02:38:54.649
[SPEAKER_15]: Bravo, JD1.

02:38:56.941 --> 02:38:59.523
[SPEAKER_15]: TigerClaw suggests maybe it is Turian genitalia.

02:39:00.784 --> 02:39:02.806
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that Turian cock looks different than that.

02:39:03.246 --> 02:39:07.870
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that would imply that Turians pull down their pants and it's like an octopus down there.

02:39:08.350 --> 02:39:11.653
[SPEAKER_07]: From those drawings, that would imply that Turians have foreskins.

02:39:13.815 --> 02:39:15.857
[SPEAKER_15]: Moving on and quickly.

02:39:17.313 --> 02:39:18.754
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, what do you have for us?

02:39:19.575 --> 02:39:25.098
[SPEAKER_15]: Before we get, we're up almost to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

02:39:25.118 --> 02:39:26.619
[SPEAKER_15]: We're almost there, but not just yet.

02:39:26.699 --> 02:39:30.422
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have banners of cocks unless that's a new game franchise that they're going to put out.

02:39:30.442 --> 02:39:30.982
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, get out!

02:39:32.183 --> 02:39:37.306
[SPEAKER_13]: But Ubisoft is, you know, they may be interested in THQ's assets.

02:39:38.227 --> 02:39:42.170
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, you know, their boss, was it Vess?

02:39:42.470 --> 02:39:44.571
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not even going to try to pronounce it.

02:39:44.691 --> 02:39:45.132
[SPEAKER_13]: French guy.

02:39:45.552 --> 02:39:45.832
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways.

02:39:47.453 --> 02:39:55.765
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, he basically said, yeah, they're always interested in good brands, and it may be something they can consider buying some of the IP from.

02:39:57.328 --> 02:40:01.554
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's just all speculation, the kind of going, reaching out to people, saying, hey, you know...

02:40:03.052 --> 02:40:10.739
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you think THQ's assets impact is going to be on the Neo Geo console or the Dreamcast or something like that?

02:40:12.641 --> 02:40:14.583
[SPEAKER_13]: But they're just kind of reaching.

02:40:15.263 --> 02:40:18.286
[SPEAKER_13]: Obviously, if they struggle enough, then they're going to try to sell off IP.

02:40:18.306 --> 02:40:21.849
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think they've already sold off IP or at least stopped making stuff.

02:40:22.770 --> 02:40:26.854
[SPEAKER_13]: I know they're still sitting on a bunch of those Udraw tablets, that's for sure.

02:40:26.874 --> 02:40:27.775
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

02:40:29.412 --> 02:40:30.193
[SPEAKER_13]: But I don't know.

02:40:30.293 --> 02:40:36.837
[SPEAKER_13]: I think right now they've kind of limited it down to what they're going to work with and they're going to make some quality games based on it.

02:40:36.877 --> 02:40:38.739
[SPEAKER_13]: Or at least they're going to try and fail.

02:40:39.659 --> 02:40:41.421
[SPEAKER_13]: But we'll see.

02:40:42.341 --> 02:40:44.563
[SPEAKER_16]: I tell you one IP they're not interested in right now.

02:40:45.403 --> 02:40:46.184
[SPEAKER_16]: UFC Undisputed.

02:40:47.084 --> 02:40:48.185
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's not theirs anymore.

02:40:49.406 --> 02:40:50.287
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be EA.

02:40:51.848 --> 02:40:51.948
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh.

02:40:54.740 --> 02:40:56.282
[SPEAKER_13]: Kill that joke.

02:40:56.302 --> 02:40:59.665
[SPEAKER_13]: They aren't interested in it because EA bought it already.

02:41:02.728 --> 02:41:03.449
[SPEAKER_15]: Alrighty then.

02:41:06.385 --> 02:41:34.181
[SPEAKER_15]: I got one more story for you guys and you know I know this I know that this is the reason that you guys tune into Orange Lounge Radio is that you want to have your news on Beyonce and I've got your Beyonce news for you right here and it has to do with that lawsuit that was going on between Beyonce and Gate 5 this was that whole thing about Superstar Beyonce the game that was going to happen and then she backed out of the deal so

02:41:36.343 --> 02:41:36.903
[SPEAKER_15]: Here it is now.

02:41:36.963 --> 02:41:43.369
[SPEAKER_15]: The appeal of the judgment where Beyonce's lawyers tried to basically get it thrown out.

02:41:43.389 --> 02:41:47.452
[SPEAKER_15]: They wanted a summary judgment in April saying the Gate 5 didn't pull in the financing.

02:41:47.753 --> 02:41:48.934
[SPEAKER_15]: That appeal failed.

02:41:49.194 --> 02:41:55.079
[SPEAKER_15]: This doesn't mean Beyonce has lost, but this means we're going to get the trial of the century.

02:41:55.219 --> 02:41:59.263
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to go to trial, and a jury will determine if they don't settle first.

02:41:59.503 --> 02:42:03.006
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's just like, trial of the century, call of duty, and settle.

02:42:03.346 --> 02:42:09.429
[SPEAKER_15]: or a jury will have to determine if Beyonce was within her contract to leave the project or if she broke the agreement.

02:42:09.829 --> 02:42:11.950
[SPEAKER_15]: So we could get a trial out of this.

02:42:11.990 --> 02:42:12.851
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be kind of fun.

02:42:12.971 --> 02:42:13.791
[SPEAKER_15]: Probably won't, though.

02:42:13.811 --> 02:42:14.532
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it'll settle.

02:42:14.672 --> 02:42:15.332
[SPEAKER_15]: You know it'll settle.

02:42:18.544 --> 02:42:20.846
[SPEAKER_13]: But all I gotta say is, man, two keytars?

02:42:21.106 --> 02:42:21.947
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just fancy.

02:42:21.987 --> 02:42:22.828
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, that's awesome.

02:42:22.928 --> 02:42:30.274
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's the thing, is that we're looking at this little picture of Beyonce doing her little sachet, and her one keyboard girl's really into it over here, but look at this one.

02:42:30.934 --> 02:42:33.216
[SPEAKER_15]: This one that looks like Juliette Lewis with blonde hair.

02:42:33.336 --> 02:42:36.839
[SPEAKER_13]: She looks like the chick from Mean Girls or whatever.

02:42:37.419 --> 02:42:39.441
[SPEAKER_13]: No, not Mean Girls, I'm sorry.

02:42:39.481 --> 02:42:42.243
[SPEAKER_13]: She looks like the chick from Glee, the one that always has the blank...

02:42:42.483 --> 02:42:43.603
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Brittany!

02:42:43.643 --> 02:42:44.924
[SPEAKER_13]: Why do I know that?

02:42:45.184 --> 02:42:46.104
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, God!

02:42:46.224 --> 02:42:46.604
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

02:42:46.664 --> 02:42:49.205
[SPEAKER_07]: I can safely say I've never seen an episode of that show.

02:42:49.225 --> 02:42:50.065
[SPEAKER_15]: I am so gay.

02:42:51.306 --> 02:42:52.226
[SPEAKER_15]: And I can say that.

02:42:52.826 --> 02:42:53.186
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, no.

02:42:53.566 --> 02:42:59.868
[SPEAKER_13]: I watched part of the series, at least the first few seasons, just because it was by the guy that did Nip Tuck, although that series was weird.

02:43:00.709 --> 02:43:04.110
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, I got out of it after about, I think, a couple seasons.

02:43:04.170 --> 02:43:05.750
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen one episode of Nip Tuck.

02:43:05.790 --> 02:43:08.091
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where they put all the liposuction fat in the woman's car.

02:43:09.639 --> 02:43:10.340
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the only episode I've seen.

02:43:10.360 --> 02:43:11.400
[SPEAKER_15]: That could be any episode, really.

02:43:11.440 --> 02:43:12.922
[SPEAKER_15]: American Horror Story is much better.

02:43:13.542 --> 02:43:14.022
[SPEAKER_15]: It's messed up.

02:43:14.062 --> 02:43:14.643
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that also him?

02:43:14.983 --> 02:43:15.624
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's also him.

02:43:16.004 --> 02:43:16.364
[SPEAKER_15]: Much better.

02:43:16.384 --> 02:43:23.089
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, if you like the FX show, you'll like American Horror Story, which is also an FX show, just so you know.

02:43:23.890 --> 02:43:24.190
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

02:43:25.091 --> 02:43:26.011
[SPEAKER_15]: They're on season two, even.

02:43:27.512 --> 02:43:35.458
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, yes, so, after all that Beyonce and Glee news, we can finally go back to video games And your phone calls!

02:43:35.658 --> 02:43:52.169
[SPEAKER_15]: Skype line's open right now, 1-877-1-877-GAME-OLR Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, all one word I'll get to the Twitter topics here in just a moment, but I thought I'd check in with Loki first to see if there's any last minute stories

02:43:52.506 --> 02:43:53.246
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, this is kind of weird.

02:43:53.307 --> 02:44:00.871
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess Nintendo, for your Nintendo ID, if you're a minor, requires a credit card verification that's going to cost you 50 cents.

02:44:01.031 --> 02:44:05.314
[SPEAKER_13]: Which leads to the question, why don't you just say you're an adult if you're a minor?

02:44:06.375 --> 02:44:08.376
[SPEAKER_13]: Save the fee and the hassle.

02:44:08.936 --> 02:44:11.498
[SPEAKER_13]: Which I'm sure most people will probably do.

02:44:12.739 --> 02:44:15.081
[SPEAKER_16]: I wonder if that's a permanent thing, because stuff like that is usually refunded.

02:44:15.121 --> 02:44:18.464
[SPEAKER_15]: Because Loki, Reggie doesn't like liars.

02:44:18.965 --> 02:44:26.692
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah, I'm sure that all those kids too are very truthful when it comes to those age-gated videos as well.

02:44:26.912 --> 02:44:33.699
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure no one says that they were born in the current date, 1900 or something like that.

02:44:34.079 --> 02:44:37.022
[SPEAKER_15]: When you go to Xtube.com, sure I was January 1st, 1900.

02:44:38.203 --> 02:44:38.803
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, exactly.

02:44:38.943 --> 02:44:40.504
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, we got a call on the line.

02:44:41.104 --> 02:44:42.704
[SPEAKER_15]: Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

02:44:43.684 --> 02:44:44.805
[SPEAKER_15]: Ranma's back again.

02:44:44.865 --> 02:44:45.465
[SPEAKER_15]: You again.

02:44:45.545 --> 02:44:46.125
[SPEAKER_15]: Gotta go.

02:44:46.225 --> 02:44:46.865
[SPEAKER_15]: Have a nice day.

02:44:46.925 --> 02:44:47.325
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I'm kidding.

02:44:47.365 --> 02:44:47.906
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey!

02:44:48.006 --> 02:44:48.866
[SPEAKER_15]: What's up, buddy?

02:44:49.966 --> 02:44:50.586
[SPEAKER_04]: Not much.

02:44:51.887 --> 02:45:00.029
[SPEAKER_15]: You did bring Reggie to OLR and ask him a really dumb question, and I mean that in like a showgirls is dumb but I love it kind of way.

02:45:02.810 --> 02:45:03.830
[SPEAKER_15]: So, what's up, buddy?

02:45:05.103 --> 02:45:32.399
[SPEAKER_04]: something interesting that happened with GameStop and now with their current set of pre-orders it seems that my brother he went to pre-order his Wii paid off in full he was going to have issues picking it up because of work and the store that's open and the whole 48 hours thing he was pretty much was told more or less that if he doesn't pick it up in 48 hours they're going to give it to somebody else

02:45:34.816 --> 02:45:46.504
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, it seems that due to an issue with the release of Assassin's Creed, it doesn't matter if you pre-order your game or console paid in full or not.

02:45:47.125 --> 02:45:49.166
[SPEAKER_04]: If somebody wants it, they can have it.

02:45:51.089 --> 02:45:51.870
[SPEAKER_15]: No, but the thing is that...

02:46:10.523 --> 02:46:13.867
[SPEAKER_04]: GameStop has now what's called no person left behind.

02:46:14.367 --> 02:46:21.273
[SPEAKER_04]: So that guarantees, even if you pre-order it, paid for it in full, if it's the last copy, you're coming to pick it up.

02:46:21.714 --> 02:46:29.541
[SPEAKER_04]: If someone beats you by 10 minutes, even though that's your copy, that other person can walk out the store with it and you'll have to wait until the next shipment.

02:46:30.001 --> 02:46:33.044
[SPEAKER_04]: And depending on the game, don't know when it's coming.

02:46:33.144 --> 02:46:34.846
[SPEAKER_13]: Then why are you pre-ordering?

02:46:36.853 --> 02:46:38.634
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my point, exactly.

02:46:39.254 --> 02:46:42.535
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, yeah, I mean, I've never been a big fan of the pre-order system at all.

02:46:42.595 --> 02:46:46.777
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't think of the last thing I pre-ordered, and that's how I voice my opinion.

02:46:46.897 --> 02:46:47.777
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't participate.

02:46:48.177 --> 02:46:57.200
[SPEAKER_15]: You didn't pre-order a Wii U. I did not pre-order a Wii U. I'm not sitting here going nanny nanny poo poo, I found one anyway, but I did find one anyway.

02:46:58.461 --> 02:47:01.081
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, like, it could happen.

02:47:01.462 --> 02:47:02.642
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, you probably couldn't do it now.

02:47:02.742 --> 02:47:04.783
[SPEAKER_15]: Now that the day is over, I don't think you're going to find one, but...

02:47:06.284 --> 02:47:09.487
[SPEAKER_15]: They're supposedly putting them out more frequently.

02:47:09.827 --> 02:47:11.649
[SPEAKER_15]: But, okay, I gotta go back to this.

02:47:11.829 --> 02:47:14.552
[SPEAKER_15]: So why couldn't your friend get there within 48 hours?

02:47:16.728 --> 02:47:17.248
[SPEAKER_04]: My bro.

02:47:17.468 --> 02:47:18.329
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, your brother.

02:47:19.130 --> 02:47:20.070
[SPEAKER_04]: It's work schedule.

02:47:20.591 --> 02:47:25.214
[SPEAKER_04]: The GameStop, he was able to pick it up, but today they were open from 11 to 6.

02:47:26.015 --> 02:47:29.618
[SPEAKER_04]: He works 11 to 7, and he's a 45-minute drive away.

02:47:31.019 --> 02:47:31.560
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, okay.

02:47:31.800 --> 02:47:35.803
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, that makes sense, and especially with all the shenanigans that have happened out there back east.

02:47:36.343 --> 02:47:38.525
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I'm sure they're still cleaning up some of the roads.

02:47:41.367 --> 02:47:42.388
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get me started about that.

02:47:42.448 --> 02:47:44.450
[SPEAKER_15]: Are they still rationing the gas and all that shit?

02:47:45.579 --> 02:47:48.701
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and New York City, I think they still are.

02:47:48.901 --> 02:47:49.421
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

02:47:49.722 --> 02:47:51.002
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to double check with that.

02:47:51.162 --> 02:47:51.543
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

02:47:52.163 --> 02:47:59.827
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, sorry, didn't mean to change the topic on you, but I do feel like this isn't the first I've heard of this policy.

02:48:00.048 --> 02:48:08.673
[SPEAKER_15]: I do want to say GameStop has kind of done this before, where it's like, well, if you don't show up to get your stuff, we are going to give it to a customer who's willing to, you know, show up and pay for it.

02:48:08.973 --> 02:48:10.053
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not saying it makes it right.

02:48:10.454 --> 02:48:12.695
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just saying I don't think this is necessarily...

02:48:13.235 --> 02:48:22.846
[SPEAKER_15]: News, but when we're talking about a $350 console that it's happening with, it does sting a hell of a lot more than some $40 game.

02:48:23.727 --> 02:48:24.327
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.

02:48:24.367 --> 02:48:25.789
[SPEAKER_13]: Stop shopping at GameStop!

02:48:25.889 --> 02:48:27.271
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, it had to be said.

02:48:27.911 --> 02:48:29.293
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you are absolutely correct.

02:48:29.313 --> 02:48:30.794
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why I shop at Best Buy.

02:48:30.814 --> 02:48:32.997
[SPEAKER_04]: They give you at least two weeks to pick up your stuff.

02:48:34.153 --> 02:48:38.777
[SPEAKER_15]: Or shit, Walmart had that whole layaway thing where you'd have to tell Christmas Day to come get it.

02:48:38.877 --> 02:48:42.199
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, you got to look at the other options.

02:48:42.840 --> 02:48:43.420
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly.

02:48:43.620 --> 02:48:45.221
[SPEAKER_15]: Or Target's where I looked out today.

02:48:45.682 --> 02:48:47.403
[SPEAKER_15]: Did I talk about that during the show?

02:48:47.503 --> 02:48:51.126
[SPEAKER_15]: I use the Target app on iPhone to see because you can check inventories.

02:48:51.626 --> 02:48:56.550
[SPEAKER_15]: And I saw that there was one, not my closest Target, but the second closest one had them in stock.

02:48:58.407 --> 02:49:03.351
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I was discussing, more or less discussing, arguing with another person that works at GameStop.

02:49:03.752 --> 02:49:13.721
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, look, if I paid for my Wii U in full, and when I get there, it's not there, that's theft.

02:49:14.562 --> 02:49:20.526
[SPEAKER_04]: Me personally, at that point, I will want a full refund of what I paid, and I'm going somewhere else to pick up my console.

02:49:20.926 --> 02:49:24.308
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this other person is arguing, it's not theft because you're still going to get it.

02:49:24.368 --> 02:49:31.432
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, yes it is, since you pretty much guaranteed me one, that last one belongs to me, and not nobody else.

02:49:33.624 --> 02:49:38.065
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's rough.

02:49:38.245 --> 02:49:41.706
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't make a fairness claim because it's not fair to anyone.

02:49:42.626 --> 02:49:49.368
[SPEAKER_16]: It's nice that they will be willing to give it up eventually, that they give you a window.

02:49:49.868 --> 02:49:51.929
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so I'm talking primarily Wii U right now.

02:49:51.969 --> 02:49:55.610
[SPEAKER_16]: You said 48 hours, but it doesn't really cover what you were talking about.

02:49:55.690 --> 02:49:56.430
[SPEAKER_16]: Assassin's Creed 3, it's...

02:49:57.270 --> 02:49:57.951
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

02:49:57.991 --> 02:50:05.938
[SPEAKER_04]: What I mean to say was because of what happened with Assassin's Creed 3, people who pre-ordered didn't get it because it went to other people.

02:50:06.198 --> 02:50:09.241
[SPEAKER_04]: So an email came from corporate from that no person left behind.

02:50:09.481 --> 02:50:12.064
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it matter about the 40-hour rule is...

02:50:13.425 --> 02:50:16.830
[SPEAKER_04]: No longer in effect, even though there's still some stores that are still doing it.

02:50:31.008 --> 02:50:32.290
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

02:50:32.450 --> 02:50:34.932
[SPEAKER_15]: I get that from a business perspective.

02:50:35.573 --> 02:50:37.495
[SPEAKER_15]: I totally get that from a business perspective.

02:50:37.535 --> 02:50:41.739
[SPEAKER_15]: But here's the question that a lot of companies don't always assess properly.

02:50:42.320 --> 02:50:49.407
[SPEAKER_15]: At what customer service sacrifice are you going to imply that business perspective?

02:50:49.447 --> 02:50:50.709
[SPEAKER_15]: It's about finding balance.

02:50:51.556 --> 02:50:54.137
[SPEAKER_16]: and GameStop's opinion, obviously at the price of $50, $60.

02:50:55.377 --> 02:50:57.938
[SPEAKER_15]: GameStop can lose a few customers and still make a profit.

02:50:57.978 --> 02:51:00.018
[SPEAKER_15]: At the same time, though, they did just close 20 stores.

02:51:00.398 --> 02:51:04.679
[SPEAKER_15]: So maybe they're not in the best position to be turning people away, but I don't know.

02:51:05.620 --> 02:51:10.541
[SPEAKER_15]: At the same time, they pissed your brother off, potentially, but they would have made someone else very happy.

02:51:11.181 --> 02:51:11.501
[SPEAKER_04]: True.

02:51:11.842 --> 02:51:13.863
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, I'm not saying it's right.

02:51:13.963 --> 02:51:17.966
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just trying to weigh the different sides of it and look at the business perspective.

02:51:18.326 --> 02:51:18.586
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

02:51:19.327 --> 02:51:22.669
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're right because I worked retail for like 15 plus years.

02:51:22.970 --> 02:51:24.691
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean I see the business side of it.

02:51:24.851 --> 02:51:27.253
[SPEAKER_04]: I also see the customer side of things.

02:51:27.513 --> 02:51:32.857
[SPEAKER_04]: If it was me personally, if I knew the person and it was like – I would do my best to hold it for them.

02:51:32.997 --> 02:51:35.659
[SPEAKER_04]: But my manager is telling me give it to the next person.

02:51:35.999 --> 02:51:36.540
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:51:54.079 --> 02:51:56.860
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, I want to come get my system, but I can't.

02:51:57.120 --> 02:52:00.742
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I have an extension until such and such reasonable time?

02:52:01.022 --> 02:52:03.923
[SPEAKER_15]: Reasonable being within another 48 hours or whatever.

02:52:04.284 --> 02:52:06.524
[SPEAKER_15]: Then grant them the stinking extension.

02:52:06.825 --> 02:52:09.806
[SPEAKER_15]: But if a person no call no shows, then give their shit away.

02:52:10.486 --> 02:52:12.167
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's a fair compromise.

02:52:12.927 --> 02:52:13.207
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

02:52:13.448 --> 02:52:13.768
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

02:52:14.728 --> 02:52:21.157
[SPEAKER_04]: But as you can see, GameStop's all about making that, I mean, ShameStop's all about making that green dollar buck.

02:52:21.478 --> 02:52:24.842
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, well, and I don't know what, I'm just some schmo with a podcast.

02:52:24.922 --> 02:52:25.984
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know what I'm talking about.

02:52:26.653 --> 02:52:27.834
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, right?

02:52:29.335 --> 02:52:32.217
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, well, we gotta let you go, buddy, but any quick final thoughts for us?

02:52:33.177 --> 02:52:34.578
[SPEAKER_15]: No, but stay fabulous.

02:52:34.878 --> 02:52:37.360
[SPEAKER_15]: I will, and stay black, and thank you for all your hard work this week.

02:52:37.880 --> 02:52:38.961
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, no problem, that's what we're here for.

02:52:39.081 --> 02:52:41.562
[SPEAKER_15]: And pass along thank you to Taiki as well, of course.

02:52:42.083 --> 02:52:42.443
[SPEAKER_16]: Will do.

02:52:42.583 --> 02:52:43.103
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, bye-bye.

02:52:44.084 --> 02:52:46.085
[SPEAKER_16]: And be sure to prepare yourself for the physical cliff.

02:52:48.968 --> 02:52:49.949
[SPEAKER_15]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

02:52:50.830 --> 02:52:53.753
[SPEAKER_15]: Ain't no one getting a Wii U if that thing doesn't get resolved, right?

02:52:54.233 --> 02:52:54.613
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

02:52:54.633 --> 02:52:58.698
[SPEAKER_15]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

02:52:58.818 --> 02:52:59.538
[SPEAKER_15]: All one word.

02:53:00.620 --> 02:53:02.542
[SPEAKER_15]: Any other last minute stories or should I get some tweets?

02:53:04.564 --> 02:53:05.805
[SPEAKER_13]: Just kind of some random stuff.

02:53:05.845 --> 02:53:08.167
[SPEAKER_13]: Tom Hardy's going to be in the Splinter Cell movie.

02:53:08.187 --> 02:53:08.808
[SPEAKER_13]: She mentioned that.

02:53:09.790 --> 02:53:10.671
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I wasn't listening.

02:53:11.252 --> 02:53:13.214
[SPEAKER_13]: I just thought I'd mention it again because Tom Hardy's awesome.

02:53:13.575 --> 02:53:16.058
[SPEAKER_13]: Although I have yet to see the last Batman movie.

02:53:17.139 --> 02:53:17.580
[SPEAKER_13]: Me too.

02:53:17.620 --> 02:53:18.161
[SPEAKER_13]: I really need to.

02:53:18.481 --> 02:53:20.483
[SPEAKER_15]: Or Avengers.

02:53:20.644 --> 02:53:22.005
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I said this on the show already.

02:53:22.085 --> 02:53:27.092
[SPEAKER_15]: The last Batman movie was great, but Tom Hardy's Bane, it really creeped me out how he sounded like Count Von Count.

02:53:28.092 --> 02:53:30.734
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to destroy Gotham City!

02:53:30.754 --> 02:53:33.076
[SPEAKER_13]: He sounded Belgian to me.

02:53:33.856 --> 02:53:37.899
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if you've seen that YouTube video series now.

02:53:37.939 --> 02:53:41.121
[SPEAKER_13]: They have Tom Hardy reading the cans of Monster Energy drink.

02:53:42.061 --> 02:53:43.302
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I haven't seen that.

02:53:43.682 --> 02:54:11.347
[SPEAKER_15]: you need to find that it's hilarious Tom Hardy is hot as hell well it's not Tom Hardy it's Bane it's Tom Hardy's Bane reading the one fish two fish alright we got another call coming in let's go to the phones hi you are on Orange Launch Radio who's this it's Amiga 777 I'm sorry say that again you are a little bit quiet Amiga 777 Amiga 777 now I can hear you buddy what's on your mind

02:54:13.444 --> 02:54:16.966
[SPEAKER_17]: Basically, the Wii U launch.

02:54:17.846 --> 02:54:18.306
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

02:54:20.707 --> 02:54:27.290
[SPEAKER_17]: Last night I was out, you know, just driving around seeing if there was anyone, you know, who might have been camping.

02:54:28.270 --> 02:54:33.253
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, out in anticipation or pre-orders, anything like that.

02:54:35.214 --> 02:54:37.515
[SPEAKER_17]: I couldn't find really anybody.

02:54:37.595 --> 02:54:38.375
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like if they...

02:54:47.428 --> 02:54:52.329
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I think a lot more stores did pre-orders this time, which was very different from last time.

02:54:53.090 --> 02:55:06.674
[SPEAKER_15]: In 2006, I remember because we drove around and looked at all the lines, and we participated in a line at Target, and there was a line at Walmart, there was a line at Best Buy, there was a line at Toys R Us, there was a line at Circuit City.

02:55:07.074 --> 02:55:08.815
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we all know why there wasn't a line there this year.

02:55:09.295 --> 02:55:12.038
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:55:31.716 --> 02:55:33.877
[SPEAKER_15]: But I sure did see some interesting tweets.

02:55:34.377 --> 02:55:36.978
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, it's Twitter, so take it with a grain of salt.

02:55:37.278 --> 02:55:46.882
[SPEAKER_15]: But I saw somebody on Twitter who said there was a line at Walmart and the third person in line bought all the remaining Wii U's and pissed everybody else off in line.

02:55:47.222 --> 02:55:48.963
[SPEAKER_15]: Because you know she was going to flip them on eBay.

02:55:49.543 --> 02:55:50.624
[SPEAKER_15]: And actually...

02:55:51.184 --> 02:55:58.948
[SPEAKER_15]: The clerk I had at Target today said somebody tried to come in and do the same thing, and they said no, because they had a policy on these items to sell only one.

02:55:59.248 --> 02:56:01.949
[SPEAKER_15]: And I said, good, because you know those are just going to end up on eBay.

02:56:01.989 --> 02:56:06.731
[SPEAKER_15]: And he's like, yeah, they need to do something about those eBay flippers.

02:56:06.771 --> 02:56:07.752
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, hell yeah they do.

02:56:08.552 --> 02:56:11.333
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, sorry, I got a little tangenty.

02:56:11.393 --> 02:56:12.454
[SPEAKER_15]: So you didn't find any lines?

02:56:14.635 --> 02:56:18.857
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I mean, I was looking for campers late at night, just waiting.

02:56:18.877 --> 02:56:19.417
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like,

02:56:20.273 --> 02:56:21.717
[SPEAKER_17]: I was like, where is everybody?

02:56:22.018 --> 02:56:23.341
[SPEAKER_15]: They all went to New York City.

02:56:23.582 --> 02:56:25.266
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought this was a big deal.

02:56:27.031 --> 02:56:27.171
[SPEAKER_17]: And...

02:56:28.812 --> 02:56:32.474
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm getting a text message correcting me from somebody listening right now.

02:56:33.194 --> 02:56:34.995
[SPEAKER_15]: They did do pre-orders at Target.

02:56:35.996 --> 02:56:38.557
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, well, shit, they didn't do enough then.

02:56:38.757 --> 02:56:39.517
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't realize they did.

02:56:39.698 --> 02:56:41.438
[SPEAKER_16]: Apparently not to sell out their first-run stock.

02:56:41.498 --> 02:56:42.619
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that's weird.

02:56:42.659 --> 02:56:45.941
[SPEAKER_15]: They must have done them real late in the game because I didn't see anything on the website or nothing.

02:56:46.001 --> 02:56:49.503
[SPEAKER_15]: But all right, I'll take his word for it.

02:56:49.923 --> 02:56:51.804
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe they didn't all do it, too.

02:56:51.824 --> 02:56:52.644
[SPEAKER_15]: It could have been certain ones.

02:56:52.724 --> 02:56:53.104
[SPEAKER_15]: But anyway...

02:56:54.745 --> 02:56:57.346
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe the time to have seen the line would have been earlier today.

02:56:57.606 --> 02:56:57.966
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

02:56:58.426 --> 02:57:03.867
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, it's kind of a bummer the line thing didn't happen because there was a lot of community that came with it.

02:57:04.088 --> 02:57:05.528
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie, I know you had a real fun time.

02:57:05.968 --> 02:57:11.770
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I don't know about real fun, but you had a well enough time in the line just kind of talking to people, right?

02:57:11.890 --> 02:57:13.290
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but it did get kind of boring.

02:57:13.860 --> 02:57:14.220
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah.

02:57:14.861 --> 02:57:16.041
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I got really sleepy.

02:57:16.081 --> 02:57:18.062
[SPEAKER_15]: At four in the morning, it starts to get old.

02:57:18.362 --> 02:57:20.563
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and then there was the woman who showed up like after all of us.

02:57:20.723 --> 02:57:22.424
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone who waited got a Wii.

02:57:23.184 --> 02:57:25.525
[SPEAKER_07]: The one woman who just showed up at five in the morning?

02:57:25.985 --> 02:57:26.185
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

02:57:27.266 --> 02:57:27.406
[SPEAKER_15]: Aw.

02:57:27.706 --> 02:57:29.027
[SPEAKER_15]: Five in the morning is still really early.

02:57:29.627 --> 02:57:32.048
[SPEAKER_15]: I walked in there at 1030 and got a Wii U today.

02:57:32.348 --> 02:57:32.528
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

02:57:33.209 --> 02:57:34.569
[SPEAKER_15]: Amiga, enough about us.

02:57:34.949 --> 02:57:35.630
[SPEAKER_15]: How about you?

02:57:35.790 --> 02:57:37.410
[SPEAKER_15]: You went around and looked at all these lines.

02:57:37.991 --> 02:57:40.832
[SPEAKER_15]: Is the Wii U something you were interested in picking up or no?

02:57:42.779 --> 02:57:52.107
[SPEAKER_17]: Kind of, sort of, you know, just really curious, you know, just, you know, it's a new system from Nintendo and I'm just hearing a lot about it.

02:57:54.088 --> 02:58:11.722
[SPEAKER_17]: Currently, you know, don't quite have the funds to get one of my own at this time, but, you know, I was taken with all the hype behind it, you know, and Reggie sees amazing on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon a couple nights ago.

02:58:11.963 --> 02:58:12.223
[SPEAKER_10]: Mm-hmm.

02:58:14.305 --> 02:58:19.831
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought I was going to be seeing a lot of avid fans of Nintendo.

02:58:21.553 --> 02:58:30.943
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess instead, I saw it as Nintendo probably just planning a light launch or something like that.

02:58:31.343 --> 02:58:35.688
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think me and maybe others might have anticipated it.

02:58:36.525 --> 02:59:06.177
[SPEAKER_15]: maybe it's something that will really start to gear up through 2013 oh yeah you do talk about the light launch and we didn't see a lot of commercials this year either I mean there was like the occasional movie screen commercial that I caught but like there's not really been the TV commercials or that whole like what they did last time with the we would like to play I think and I heard this theory on Bobby's show and it seems perfectly reasonable to me they're just saving all that money to market them next year after Christmas makes sense to me

02:59:07.373 --> 02:59:09.794
[SPEAKER_16]: or after Thanksgiving, the bigger holiday rush.

02:59:10.094 --> 02:59:10.534
[SPEAKER_15]: Either or.

02:59:10.954 --> 02:59:13.995
[SPEAKER_15]: But just why blow all the money now when all your pre-orders sold out?

02:59:14.655 --> 02:59:15.715
[SPEAKER_15]: Who do you have to advertise to?

02:59:16.095 --> 02:59:17.356
[SPEAKER_15]: Let the word of mouth do its thing.

02:59:19.536 --> 02:59:20.557
[SPEAKER_17]: Very true.

02:59:20.757 --> 02:59:21.137
[SPEAKER_15]: Very true.

02:59:21.377 --> 02:59:24.598
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, Amiga77, I hope you're able to get one if you want one.

02:59:24.998 --> 02:59:27.478
[SPEAKER_15]: Hopefully, maybe your luck will turn around around the holidays.

02:59:27.899 --> 02:59:29.379
[SPEAKER_15]: But thanks so much for calling the show, alright?

02:59:30.754 --> 02:59:32.435
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, take care, buddy.

02:59:32.615 --> 02:59:32.775
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.

02:59:33.616 --> 02:59:33.936
[SPEAKER_15]: Bye-bye.

02:59:36.117 --> 02:59:36.798
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for the call.

02:59:36.938 --> 02:59:38.299
[SPEAKER_15]: I haven't heard from him in a long time.

02:59:38.579 --> 02:59:41.961
[SPEAKER_15]: Appreciate hearing from some callers we don't hear from all the time.

02:59:42.781 --> 02:59:45.503
[SPEAKER_15]: TigerClaw in chat says, I haven't seen any Wii U commercials.

02:59:45.563 --> 02:59:48.385
[SPEAKER_15]: I only see a lot of commercials for that Red Dawn remake.

02:59:49.165 --> 02:59:52.670
[SPEAKER_15]: which apparently, according to the commercial, always got a lot of good reviews.

02:59:53.091 --> 02:59:54.393
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, here's the thing.

02:59:54.854 --> 03:00:01.704
[SPEAKER_15]: There are so many movie critics that'll say good things about any fucking movie just to be in the commercial and gain their own cred.

03:00:02.024 --> 03:00:02.505
[SPEAKER_15]: Believe it.

03:00:04.002 --> 03:00:07.124
[SPEAKER_07]: For the record, I'm sorry, Red Dawn was a movie in the 80s.

03:00:07.144 --> 03:00:07.384
[SPEAKER_07]: It was.

03:00:07.964 --> 03:00:08.444
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all.

03:00:08.644 --> 03:00:10.165
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the only thing I have to say about that.

03:00:10.245 --> 03:00:12.787
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're remaking it because you know it's so topical.

03:00:12.807 --> 03:00:16.569
[SPEAKER_13]: I kind of want to see the sequel or the second one or the remake or whatever you want to call it.

03:00:16.749 --> 03:00:17.749
[SPEAKER_13]: I kind of want to see it.

03:00:17.809 --> 03:00:18.129
[SPEAKER_13]: Really?

03:00:18.169 --> 03:00:19.150
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it looks kind of cool.

03:00:19.610 --> 03:00:19.930
Really?

03:00:20.551 --> 03:00:24.593
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want the scene where the girl's dead and she has the grenade on her and they find her and they blow up.

03:00:25.173 --> 03:00:28.795
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not like, you know, I don't think it's going to be better than the original or anything like that.

03:00:28.815 --> 03:00:30.356
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just going to be, it's just a movie.

03:00:30.496 --> 03:00:30.896
[SPEAKER_13]: Whatever.

03:00:31.256 --> 03:00:32.537
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just a dumb popcorn flick.

03:00:33.095 --> 03:00:33.595
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.

03:00:33.795 --> 03:00:35.136
[SPEAKER_13]: It is a dumb popcorn flick.

03:00:36.116 --> 03:00:41.859
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's been a lot of dumb popcorn flicks that have come out, like Dread, that ended up being really good.

03:00:42.579 --> 03:00:44.881
[SPEAKER_16]: Dread was amazingly good.

03:00:45.141 --> 03:00:45.781
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, man.

03:00:46.161 --> 03:00:48.322
[SPEAKER_16]: It's funny to say, that's the last movie that I saw.

03:00:48.462 --> 03:00:49.543
[SPEAKER_16]: I've missed Avengers.

03:00:49.703 --> 03:00:51.244
[SPEAKER_16]: I've missed Prometheus.

03:00:51.644 --> 03:00:53.104
[SPEAKER_16]: I haven't seen Wreck-It Ralph yet.

03:00:53.144 --> 03:00:53.925
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to see Skyfall.

03:00:53.965 --> 03:00:54.985
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to see all of those.

03:00:55.465 --> 03:00:57.106
[SPEAKER_16]: For some reason, I just don't see movies enough.

03:00:57.586 --> 03:01:00.328
[SPEAKER_16]: But when I was out in New Mexico, I saw Dread with some friends of mine.

03:01:00.488 --> 03:01:00.648
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, man.

03:01:00.888 --> 03:01:05.232
[SPEAKER_16]: Man, knew nothing about it going in other than Judge Dredd and completely worth it.

03:01:05.252 --> 03:01:06.334
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to have the pinball table.

03:01:06.354 --> 03:01:08.836
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if I played that one.

03:01:09.136 --> 03:01:09.457
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

03:01:09.477 --> 03:01:09.997
[SPEAKER_15]: It's okay.

03:01:10.117 --> 03:01:12.700
[SPEAKER_15]: If anybody else wants to call, I can squeeze in one other quick call.

03:01:12.720 --> 03:01:15.923
[SPEAKER_15]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

03:01:16.464 --> 03:01:17.385
[SPEAKER_15]: Any other last minute stories?

03:01:17.425 --> 03:01:18.946
[SPEAKER_15]: I still have some Twitter topics to do, but...

03:01:19.947 --> 03:01:35.655
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, as we kind of mentioned a little bit, your Nintendo Network account is tied to your Wii U, so if it breaks, I guess you better send it to Nintendo, because I'm sure they can transfer it to a new system, but if you try to go buy a new system, you're fucked.

03:01:36.275 --> 03:01:37.196
[SPEAKER_13]: So, just saying.

03:01:38.436 --> 03:01:41.818
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm giving Nintendo the benefit of the doubt here that they just haven't implemented that yet.

03:01:42.179 --> 03:01:42.519
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope.

03:01:42.699 --> 03:01:43.059
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope.

03:01:43.199 --> 03:01:53.285
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm thinking that it's something that a consumer can't just go buy a new system that they have to send it in Nintendo for a repair and then they can do the transfer because that's how it was with the Wii.

03:01:53.465 --> 03:01:58.768
[SPEAKER_13]: How do you get all your Wii or Wii virtual console crap transferred over that they would have to do it.

03:01:59.268 --> 03:02:22.522
[SPEAKER_13]: and then of course somebody accidentally found a way to get into the dev stuff or the debug menu for the Wii U thing and then there was another one that someone put that somehow they got into the debug thing for the Wii U Miiverse but I think that's photoshopped so I'm not going to say anything about that but yeah the debug menu though on the actual system I can believe that

03:02:23.817 --> 03:02:24.137
[SPEAKER_15]: TigerClaw.com

03:02:43.257 --> 03:02:51.603
[SPEAKER_15]: The Human Rights Campaign, which champions a lot of LGBT causes, which, you know, obviously huge, huge month for them with the elections.

03:02:52.563 --> 03:02:58.407
[SPEAKER_15]: Microsoft and EA were recognized as best places to work for LGBT equality.

03:02:58.849 --> 03:03:07.439
[SPEAKER_15]: And I love that the picture on this article is Kaiden and Man Shepard from Mass Effect 3, which is a great example from EA's universe.

03:03:09.481 --> 03:03:11.704
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm telling you, I don't care how it makes me sound.

03:03:12.124 --> 03:03:14.127
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the reason I played Mass Effect.

03:03:14.187 --> 03:03:16.009
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, alright, I do need to play Mass Effect.

03:03:16.049 --> 03:03:17.550
[SPEAKER_15]: I gotta see what this is all about.

03:03:18.472 --> 03:03:19.413
[SPEAKER_15]: I was not disappointed.

03:03:19.873 --> 03:03:21.195
[SPEAKER_15]: But there's something in it for everybody.

03:03:23.577 --> 03:03:25.800
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know Microsoft has always got kudos to this.

03:03:26.080 --> 03:03:29.864
[SPEAKER_15]: I saw there was like an official Microsoft gamer con video that they did.

03:03:29.924 --> 03:03:32.787
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know they've always been pretty good too with this stuff.

03:03:33.208 --> 03:03:33.828
[SPEAKER_15]: So good for them.

03:03:34.849 --> 03:03:39.555
[SPEAKER_15]: The 2013 Corporate Equality Index is the national benchmarking tool on corporate policies.

03:03:39.895 --> 03:03:41.597
[SPEAKER_15]: This is according to the official website.

03:03:42.237 --> 03:03:46.479
[SPEAKER_15]: and EA's Chief Talent Officer, Gabrielle Toledano.

03:03:46.919 --> 03:03:55.083
[SPEAKER_15]: I am very pleased that EA has scored 100% rating and has been recognized by the Human Rights Campaign in a year where the company has taken significant steps to remain inclusive.

03:03:55.543 --> 03:04:02.706
[SPEAKER_15]: EA has made changes to our medical benefits, been involved in LGBT events in our community and taken a public stance against the Defense of Marriage Act.

03:04:03.166 --> 03:04:07.728
[SPEAKER_15]: EA champions diversity with a work environment where everyone feels welcome and can be themselves.

03:04:08.288 --> 03:04:18.070
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I sometimes forget that like I have Alan on my medical insurance because, you know, we've been together long enough that it's basically whether we're legally recognized or not.

03:04:18.110 --> 03:04:19.851
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like a common law partnership at this thing.

03:04:20.231 --> 03:04:21.311
[SPEAKER_15]: I can put him on my benefits.

03:04:21.371 --> 03:04:21.891
[SPEAKER_15]: No problem.

03:04:21.911 --> 03:04:25.552
[SPEAKER_15]: Because, you know, I'm in California and I work for a health insurance company that recognize that stuff.

03:04:25.952 --> 03:04:28.392
[SPEAKER_15]: I sometimes forget like not everybody's that lucky.

03:04:29.153 --> 03:04:30.693
[SPEAKER_15]: He just blows my mind.

03:04:32.635 --> 03:04:45.835
[SPEAKER_13]: I had one more last minute story please it's kind of cool it's a Black Ops 2 easter egg in the Nuketown 2025 map if you shoot off all the mannequins heads on that map in under 60 seconds it unlocks an Atari 2600

03:04:47.937 --> 03:05:01.310
[SPEAKER_13]: on the TV in the game, the Nuketown TV, the big old screen TV, and you can play Activision games, including Hero, Pitfall, and Kaboom were some of the ones I did see screenshots for.

03:05:01.530 --> 03:05:01.810
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.

03:05:02.871 --> 03:05:03.532
[SPEAKER_13]: Or video on.

03:05:04.482 --> 03:05:19.629
[SPEAKER_15]: a couple questions and comments on Twitter from Osfer on Twitter not sold on the Wii U wait until some relevant games come out I think you're in camp Loki over there I think Loki will be swayed if the right games come out but we ain't there yet Bayonetta 2

03:05:21.635 --> 03:05:22.776
[SPEAKER_15]: Ways off still.

03:05:22.956 --> 03:05:29.181
[SPEAKER_15]: But I bet there's going to be that Zelda or that big game is going to be a must-have next year.

03:05:29.281 --> 03:05:29.681
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll see.

03:05:30.061 --> 03:05:30.421
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll see.

03:05:31.943 --> 03:05:32.743
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not disappointed.

03:05:34.064 --> 03:05:35.745
[SPEAKER_15]: Spazinator PSN tweets us.

03:05:36.686 --> 03:05:37.386
[SPEAKER_15]: Random question.

03:05:37.807 --> 03:05:41.669
[SPEAKER_15]: If you three could only pick one to play, which would you pick?

03:05:42.330 --> 03:05:45.412
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to say you four because he didn't know maybe that Jason was going to be here tonight.

03:05:45.732 --> 03:05:46.553
[SPEAKER_15]: Which would you pick?

03:05:46.933 --> 03:05:49.735
[SPEAKER_15]: PC gaming or console games?

03:05:50.215 --> 03:05:50.675
[SPEAKER_15]: and why?

03:05:51.375 --> 03:05:54.156
[SPEAKER_15]: So you only get one or the other ever again.

03:05:54.476 --> 03:05:56.376
[SPEAKER_15]: PC gaming or console and why?

03:05:56.616 --> 03:05:56.996
[SPEAKER_07]: PC.

03:05:57.576 --> 03:05:57.756
[SPEAKER_15]: Why?

03:05:57.816 --> 03:06:00.077
[SPEAKER_07]: Practically everything that I want to play on the console is on the PC.

03:06:01.257 --> 03:06:04.958
[SPEAKER_07]: I can hook up a controller to the PC and play it as it was a console game.

03:06:05.318 --> 03:06:09.878
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus I've got a whole bunch of other games that were made specifically for PC so it really expands my repertoire.

03:06:10.278 --> 03:06:19.260
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus I have emulators for classic games so technically I could also play console games on my PC with the right emulator.

03:06:20.529 --> 03:06:21.469
[SPEAKER_15]: DC Universe Jason

03:06:48.396 --> 03:06:57.329
[SPEAKER_16]: Console gaming, because if there were a computer, I have completely admittedly the library of games I want to play would not be on the platform.

03:06:58.411 --> 03:07:02.116
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I'm sure people who care will understand that.

03:07:02.800 --> 03:07:20.880
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I'm gonna go with PC as well, and I think, uh, for most of the same reasons as Jamie, I, it's not, it's not that I necessarily prefer PC over console, I mean, they, they have their perks, but there are some games on PC that just are never gonna happen on the console, like Civ, Civ V.

03:07:21.821 --> 03:07:45.790
[SPEAKER_15]: Not gonna happen Typing of the Dead World of Warcraft Hello, that's like the game I play more than anything That's, you know, PC only And I was gonna say the bit about emulators But she took the words out of my mouth Is that most of the classics you can still get on PC Whether, you know, Spazinator would consider that cheating or not I guess it's to be seen But I would say PC gaming So

03:07:46.488 --> 03:07:47.908
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, that's it for Twitter.

03:07:48.108 --> 03:07:51.369
[SPEAKER_15]: How about anything else with last minute stories, Loki?

03:07:52.929 --> 03:07:54.690
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, no, got nothing.

03:07:55.430 --> 03:07:56.810
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, we got one more call coming in.

03:07:56.850 --> 03:08:00.831
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just about to click the button to close it, but we have one more call coming in and sure we'll take it.

03:08:01.151 --> 03:08:02.151
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

03:08:02.171 --> 03:08:02.511
[SPEAKER_15]: Who's this?

03:08:03.291 --> 03:08:04.471
[SPEAKER_15]: Wolverines!

03:08:05.372 --> 03:08:05.992
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

03:08:06.432 --> 03:08:07.092
[SPEAKER_15]: It's Sterlok.

03:08:07.272 --> 03:08:08.712
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, Sterlok, what's on your mind, buddy?

03:08:11.073 --> 03:08:12.573
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, yeah, not too much.

03:08:13.073 --> 03:08:13.173
[SPEAKER_11]: Um,

03:08:15.430 --> 03:08:19.172
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been checking out Wii U stuff all day.

03:08:19.232 --> 03:08:22.554
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems pretty cool.

03:08:24.755 --> 03:08:25.035
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

03:08:25.155 --> 03:08:35.261
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm liking the whole tablet thing and not needing the TV on if you don't even want to feel like doing that.

03:08:36.584 --> 03:08:36.624
[SPEAKER_15]: Um...

03:09:03.530 --> 03:09:07.493
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, first of all, good games that I care about.

03:09:07.573 --> 03:09:10.755
[SPEAKER_11]: And really, as it stands right now, I don't think there's a whole lot.

03:09:12.196 --> 03:09:17.240
[SPEAKER_11]: Just like how the Vita kind of was.

03:09:17.961 --> 03:09:24.265
[SPEAKER_11]: It didn't really have much starting, and it's slowly getting more and more games that I care about.

03:09:26.627 --> 03:09:31.771
[SPEAKER_11]: What I like is, I guess the tablet actually does have a headphone jack in it.

03:09:33.109 --> 03:09:42.947
[SPEAKER_11]: so that's kind of cool obviously my big thing is being able to use the freaking buttons

03:09:45.186 --> 03:09:45.786
[SPEAKER_11]: for the menus.

03:09:45.926 --> 03:09:48.567
[SPEAKER_15]: I honestly haven't explored that to see if that's a possibility.

03:09:49.767 --> 03:09:52.608
[SPEAKER_11]: I've heard that, yeah, you can for at least most things.

03:09:53.648 --> 03:09:54.228
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's good.

03:09:55.369 --> 03:10:07.692
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if you caught my comment earlier in the show, but one of the things I really love about the Wii U is the whole fact that the sound on the TV and the sound coming out of the gamepad will really complement each other.

03:10:08.052 --> 03:10:11.793
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm not just talking about the incidentals like we were used to hearing with the Wii.

03:10:12.193 --> 03:10:13.194
[SPEAKER_15]: I heard with Zombie U, your radio...

03:10:31.225 --> 03:10:38.853
[SPEAKER_11]: Transmissions, like the stuff that you're getting through, you know, your radio actually comes out of the tablet, which is pretty neat.

03:10:39.313 --> 03:10:41.915
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, and Batman Arkham City does something similar.

03:10:42.056 --> 03:10:44.958
[SPEAKER_15]: If you are close to the person, you'll hear it from the TV.

03:10:45.078 --> 03:10:48.021
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're far away, you'll hear it on the tablet as a radio transmission.

03:10:48.041 --> 03:10:49.022
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that is cool.

03:10:49.162 --> 03:10:49.803
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:10:50.103 --> 03:10:50.844
[SPEAKER_15]: That's very cool.

03:10:51.465 --> 03:10:53.446
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, what I'm curious about is I wonder, like,

03:10:55.243 --> 03:11:12.499
[SPEAKER_11]: If all of the game audio, like say if you have your TV doing something else and you're just using the controller, I wonder if all of your game audio is going to be streamed as well or if it's just going to be the...

03:11:13.357 --> 03:11:15.038
[SPEAKER_11]: Incidentals, that's what I'm curious about.

03:11:15.218 --> 03:11:16.279
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it depends on the game.

03:11:16.519 --> 03:11:27.447
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I would have to say, if I would have to take an educated guess, Rob was playing Mario, and the gamepad experience versus the TV was identical.

03:11:28.207 --> 03:11:32.571
[SPEAKER_16]: I would assume that when headphones are in there, I didn't really hear anything coming out of the gamepad.

03:11:32.591 --> 03:11:35.793
[SPEAKER_15]: The music was not identical, because they were complementing each other.

03:11:35.953 --> 03:11:41.737
[SPEAKER_15]: But most of the sound effects, you probably couldn't hear it all the way back here, because you're just hearing all the sound from the side of the room.

03:11:41.897 --> 03:11:42.378
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for watching!

03:12:04.421 --> 03:12:12.543
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, I wanted to bring up a word of caution for those that are big fans of Super Smash Bros.

03:12:12.623 --> 03:12:16.724
[SPEAKER_11]: Brawl, particularly with the GameCube controls.

03:12:19.225 --> 03:12:23.346
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't get rid of your Wii, because Wii U doesn't have GameCube ports.

03:12:23.466 --> 03:12:24.726
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, that's a very good point.

03:12:25.626 --> 03:12:31.408
[SPEAKER_11]: And general consensus from many, many people that I've seen is

03:12:33.086 --> 03:12:35.468
[SPEAKER_11]: GameCube controller is kind of the best way to play Brawl.

03:12:35.728 --> 03:12:37.789
[SPEAKER_15]: What about the Pro controller?

03:12:37.809 --> 03:12:39.350
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I guess maybe it wouldn't work.

03:12:39.650 --> 03:12:40.871
[SPEAKER_11]: That wouldn't work with Brawl, though.

03:12:41.732 --> 03:12:42.092
[SPEAKER_15]: Yikes.

03:12:43.013 --> 03:12:43.333
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

03:12:44.254 --> 03:12:46.715
[SPEAKER_15]: They need to bring back the Wave Bird.

03:12:47.736 --> 03:12:48.216
[SPEAKER_11]: No shit.

03:12:48.236 --> 03:12:51.138
[SPEAKER_11]: The only thing the Wave Bird was missing was Rumble.

03:12:51.899 --> 03:12:53.920
[SPEAKER_11]: That would have made it perfect.

03:12:54.120 --> 03:12:54.580
[SPEAKER_11]: That's true.

03:12:55.181 --> 03:12:59.584
[SPEAKER_11]: But that is probably one of my favorite controllers still.

03:13:00.327 --> 03:13:28.046
[SPEAKER_11]: it was a good controller just nice and sturdy and just I have my collection of wave birds I do actually have four wave birds one of them is an E3 wave bird that my friend sold me alright well Sterlok I gotta let you go so we can wrap up but any other comments before we let you go um it has nothing to do with games but um swear to god

03:13:30.259 --> 03:13:38.443
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if it's still there, but there was a single box of Twinkies on eBay with a buy it now of $10,000.

03:13:40.144 --> 03:13:40.924
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not kidding.

03:13:41.504 --> 03:13:42.445
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking ridiculous.

03:13:43.245 --> 03:13:43.686
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, right?

03:13:44.206 --> 03:13:46.667
[SPEAKER_15]: And I hope they're gold-plated Twinkies.

03:13:46.687 --> 03:13:49.769
[SPEAKER_11]: You know all that shit's going to be bought out and don't...

03:13:50.858 --> 03:13:51.939
[SPEAKER_11]: Bimbo will do it.

03:13:52.259 --> 03:13:52.960
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll be fine.

03:13:53.000 --> 03:13:54.902
[SPEAKER_15]: Twinkies aren't even that good anyway.

03:13:54.982 --> 03:13:55.722
[SPEAKER_15]: I am telling you.

03:13:56.023 --> 03:13:57.164
[SPEAKER_15]: Shit, my thing is Ding Dongs.

03:13:57.304 --> 03:13:59.986
[SPEAKER_15]: Little Debbie Strawberry Shortcakes are the bomb.

03:14:00.046 --> 03:14:00.586
[SPEAKER_15]: Nutty Bars.

03:14:01.007 --> 03:14:05.551
[SPEAKER_07]: But remember, we have two Weird Al references with Hostess products.

03:14:05.611 --> 03:14:05.991
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

03:14:06.131 --> 03:14:08.233
[SPEAKER_07]: Ding Dong Man, Ding Dong, Ding Dong Yo.

03:14:09.134 --> 03:14:13.037
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Twinkie Wiener Sandwich.

03:14:14.093 --> 03:14:14.473
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

03:14:15.013 --> 03:14:18.694
[SPEAKER_15]: The only Twinkie that I accept is a deep-fried Twinkie.

03:14:19.034 --> 03:14:22.835
[SPEAKER_07]: I only could eat half of one when we did those at the tourney.

03:14:23.055 --> 03:14:34.257
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know, that just sounds like... A part of DDR's history in Sacramento has died because we had the only DDR tournament ever to sell deep-fried Twinkies.

03:14:35.477 --> 03:14:35.857
[SPEAKER_15]: Why?

03:14:36.697 --> 03:14:37.797
[SPEAKER_15]: Why the fuck not, bitch?

03:14:37.817 --> 03:14:40.398
[SPEAKER_11]: What a distinguishing factor you have there.

03:14:42.079 --> 03:14:44.822
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, in Sacramento, we did it fucked up.

03:14:44.982 --> 03:14:50.828
[SPEAKER_15]: Because our first tournament was SCAT, Sacramento Cosplay and Tournament.

03:14:53.431 --> 03:14:53.691
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

03:14:54.071 --> 03:14:55.853
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was great.

03:14:55.873 --> 03:14:57.034
[SPEAKER_11]: There was an NES game called SCAT.

03:15:01.859 --> 03:15:02.460
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, there was.

03:15:02.540 --> 03:15:03.640
[SPEAKER_15]: That was a damn good game.

03:15:03.940 --> 03:15:04.301
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

03:15:04.661 --> 03:15:11.885
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I got to give this call the shaft, as in Sacramento hosts another fabulous tournament, and say goodnight.

03:15:12.005 --> 03:15:12.945
[SPEAKER_15]: So take care, Sterlok.

03:15:13.265 --> 03:15:13.586
[SPEAKER_00]: See ya.

03:15:13.786 --> 03:15:14.086
[SPEAKER_15]: See ya.

03:15:15.026 --> 03:15:18.148
[SPEAKER_15]: We had the best acronyms for our... I mean, like, nobody could top that in the DDR.

03:15:18.168 --> 03:15:19.189
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we were awesome.

03:15:19.229 --> 03:15:19.789
[SPEAKER_15]: We were awesome.

03:15:20.638 --> 03:15:23.219
[SPEAKER_15]: Even though everybody in the Bay Area hated Sacramento.

03:15:23.979 --> 03:15:26.579
[SPEAKER_15]: Nah, that was mostly one or two dickhead loudmouths.

03:15:26.919 --> 03:15:27.680
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, anyhow.

03:15:29.220 --> 03:15:30.680
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's not dig up 10-year-old drama.

03:15:30.720 --> 03:15:31.680
[SPEAKER_15]: Burn them bridges.

03:15:32.381 --> 03:15:33.901
[SPEAKER_15]: But we're here and they're somewhere else.

03:15:34.261 --> 03:15:34.881
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, anyhow.

03:15:35.901 --> 03:15:37.662
