Orange Lounge Radio

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki

00:14.000 --> 00:20.400
Tonight, November 18th, 2012, the Wii U launches in North America, loyal Microsoft users are

00:20.400 --> 00:27.400
rewarded with a free Xbox 360, and PlayStation Plus is set to debut on the Vita.

00:27.400 --> 00:31.400
Orange Lounge Radio

00:31.400 --> 00:39.400
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio.

00:39.400 --> 00:46.400
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle with my buddies.

00:46.400 --> 00:49.400
Say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

00:49.400 --> 00:50.400
Hi.

00:50.400 --> 00:51.400
Hi, how are you?

00:51.400 --> 00:53.400
I'm sick of donuts.

00:53.400 --> 00:59.400
Oh god, not the hostess thing. Were you one of those people clearing out 7-Eleven?

00:59.400 --> 01:18.400
No, no, actually not at all. I was watching Undersedation Live last night and they were eating, well Travis was eating Ding Dongs, Twinkies, all kinds of stuff and all of a sudden I wanted donuts and this Martin Final around the corner from my house had them.

01:18.400 --> 01:25.400
So I bought 10 of them and gave a pack to a homeless guy and the rest of them are now in my fridge at home.

01:25.400 --> 01:36.400
So should I have the urge to eat a donut, which I really shouldn't be because wheat makes me sick, but I have them now. I ate a pack today, I wish I hadn't.

01:36.400 --> 01:52.400
Here's the thing, I'm not going to get into the whole why about it, but I'm going to tell you why the closure pisses me off is because Hostess also makes, and I don't know if this is a nationwide thing, it might be a regional thing, but they make this bread called Columbo Bread, which is the sourdough bread that is so flipping good.

01:52.400 --> 01:54.400
Columbo is its own brand.

01:54.400 --> 01:55.400
Right, but it's part of Hostess.

01:55.400 --> 01:57.400
I know, right, but Columbo also makes frozen yogurt.

01:57.400 --> 01:58.400
Oh, okay.

01:58.400 --> 02:07.400
Columbo also makes a bunch of other baked goods, but they also do, because it used to be a major competitor for the company that my dad used to work for.

02:07.400 --> 02:13.400
My dad used to work for a distributor called W.J. Powell Company and they did a different bread for their supplier.

02:13.400 --> 02:17.400
Columbo was one of the big southern competitors.

02:17.400 --> 02:22.400
Oh, I always thought they were based out here because San Francisco is sourdough bread.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.400
Yeah, but they also do other kinds of breads.

02:24.400 --> 02:25.400
Oh, okay.

02:25.400 --> 02:32.400
It's a national bread company and they also do frozen yogurt and other, let's see what I'm thinking of, mass distribution foods.

02:32.400 --> 02:38.400
Well, my point was, I'm not going to be able to get that sourdough bread anymore, at least until somebody buys the company or whatever.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.400
Well, you can go to Fucking Boudin and get good bread.

02:40.400 --> 02:46.400
But I love Columbo Bread, you shut up. Alright. Also, say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

02:46.400 --> 02:50.400
I completely was ignoring everything you guys were talking about for the last minute or two.

02:50.400 --> 02:53.400
Hostess, you don't have an opinion on Twinkies?

02:53.400 --> 02:54.400
I don't like them.

02:54.400 --> 02:59.400
I think people are going way too crazy over this, but it's because everybody remembers them from a kid.

02:59.400 --> 03:06.400
Like, I don't know about you guys, but like a Twinkie was like a staple dessert that came with your little bag lunch.

03:06.400 --> 03:09.400
Holy crap, it's cake with frosting inside.

03:09.400 --> 03:13.400
Wow, no one will ever be able to do that.

03:14.400 --> 03:19.400
Well, Little Debbie, if you eat Little Debbie stuff, strawberry shortcakes are superior.

03:19.400 --> 03:23.400
No, no, no, no. It's all about oatmeal cream pies.

03:23.400 --> 03:31.400
I don't know if they actually had like a Hostess like end cap or whatever at our local grocery store, and now it's all Little Debbie stuff now.

03:31.400 --> 03:38.400
They just like completely removed it all. I don't know if they have like return it all before, you know, their, you know.

03:38.400 --> 03:43.400
Little Debbie was probably the one that, you know, convinced them all to join the union and all that. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I don't want to go there.

03:43.400 --> 03:49.400
All right. Also say hello to the one, the only Jason is joining us in studio tonight.

03:49.400 --> 03:50.400
Hello again, everybody.

03:50.400 --> 03:54.400
Mr. VX Jason X V X Y Z Q R S T U P.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.400
Yeah.

03:55.400 --> 03:56.400
Hey for me.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.400
How you doing?

03:58.400 --> 04:08.400
I'm tired from zipping south of San Francisco and north of San Francisco and train for much too long as usual and you know, but I'm here. So why not?

04:08.400 --> 04:10.400
And commuting back and forth from Colorado.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.400
Uh huh.

04:11.400 --> 04:21.400
Which by the way, being that you see, politics is pretty bad here because you know, it's bad everywhere, but like at least we're not a swing state.

04:21.400 --> 04:23.400
Like everybody knew how California was going to vote.

04:23.400 --> 04:24.400
Oh yeah.

04:24.400 --> 04:29.400
Your state on the other hand. Oh my God. You must be really fucking sick of politics.

04:29.400 --> 04:33.400
And this is I not watching TV.

04:33.400 --> 04:42.400
The only exposure to politics that I had was every once in a while that Facebook either a sponsored post or you know, a friend liking something that shows up on my feed.

04:42.400 --> 04:44.400
It was surprisingly minimal.

04:44.400 --> 04:49.400
I didn't get too much of it and I could very easily just skim the sponsored posts.

04:49.400 --> 04:59.400
But the one thing that I did get is YouTube partner channels. The ones that actually monetize their channel. Politic two minute political ads every single video.

04:59.400 --> 05:07.400
And there have been a couple of gaming shows. The Continue Show, Game Grumps, and then individually John Chon and Egoraptor.

05:07.400 --> 05:10.400
I've been watching a ton of their videos and they all monetize.

05:10.400 --> 05:19.400
So the start of every episode, the end of every episode for whatever reason, even though you can just skip it, and the middle of particularly long episodes.

05:19.400 --> 05:23.400
Political ad, political ad, political ad, political ad, political ad.

05:23.400 --> 05:27.400
So it wasn't terribly specific for my region, but it still sucked.

05:27.400 --> 05:32.400
This is why you don't see Wii U commercials anywhere because the politicians bought up all the ad space.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.400
Yeah, they really did.

05:33.400 --> 05:34.400
There it is.

05:34.400 --> 05:38.400
I'm going to have fun trivia about politics since we're on the subject to get it out of the way.

05:38.400 --> 05:42.400
So everybody knows the two candidates that were in all 50 states.

05:42.400 --> 05:48.400
Most people know that there are actually six candidates that are in 47 of the states, I think.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.400
Like Roseanne.

05:49.400 --> 05:54.400
Correct. Roseanne Barr, Jill Stein, Gary Johnson, and I always forget the fourth guy.

05:54.400 --> 05:56.400
Columbus voted for Jill Stein, by the way.

05:56.400 --> 05:57.400
Virgil something.

05:57.400 --> 06:01.400
Yeah, Virgil Goode. Virgil Goode. Somebody always remembers that name when I never do. It's the weirdest thing.

06:01.400 --> 06:03.400
You know how many presidential candidates were on the Colorado ballot?

06:03.400 --> 06:04.400
How many?

06:04.400 --> 06:05.400
Sixteen.

06:05.400 --> 06:06.400
Wow.

06:06.400 --> 06:15.400
Yeah. I don't know if it was sarcastic, but somebody told me that the only thing you have to do to get on the ballot is to have some kind of party application.

06:15.400 --> 06:19.400
You have to have some kind of a political party and pay $500.

06:19.400 --> 06:24.400
Now, okay, I'm not going to ask you how you voted in elections because that's, you know, a touchy subject and whatever.

06:24.400 --> 06:30.400
But also I do want to remind everybody, it is a video game show and there is the always present extra guest in our chat room.

06:30.400 --> 06:31.400
Hi, everybody.

06:31.400 --> 06:33.400
Duke Nukem says don't fuck with Roseanne.

06:33.400 --> 06:38.400
We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, voguesnetwork.com.

06:38.400 --> 06:43.400
Six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. It is a live experience.

06:43.400 --> 06:45.400
But of course, we love the podcasties as well.

06:45.400 --> 06:47.400
And he said, yeah, Duke Nukem says don't fuck with Roseanne.

06:47.400 --> 06:49.400
So Duke Nukem must have been a Roseanne fan.

06:49.400 --> 06:56.400
I'm not going to ask about the big one because, you know, that's still got a lot of, like, a lot of ruffled feathers and so forth.

06:56.400 --> 07:04.400
But I got to know, how do you feel being in one of these states where you can get weed anywhere you want now?

07:04.400 --> 07:05.400
It is legal weed.

07:05.400 --> 07:06.400
Up to an ounce.

07:06.400 --> 07:07.400
Up to an ounce.

07:07.400 --> 07:08.400
Up to an ounce.

07:08.400 --> 07:09.400
I don't, I.

07:09.400 --> 07:10.400
I know you're not a smoker.

07:10.400 --> 07:13.400
And to be fair, disclaimer, nobody here at OLR, like, actually smokes it.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.400
But, you know, I.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.400
I love brownies.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.400
I find the cold.

07:17.400 --> 07:18.400
I just, I.

07:18.400 --> 07:21.400
That's how I found out I wasn't actually allergic to the substance.

07:21.400 --> 07:22.400
I'm allergic to the smoke.

07:22.400 --> 07:26.400
I actually eat all that snacky food because I'm just a fat pig.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.400
Like, I'm not even smoking weed.

07:28.400 --> 07:29.400
I'm just a fat pig.

07:29.400 --> 07:32.400
But how do you feel about all that being in that state?

07:32.400 --> 07:44.400
The best thing that's come out of this is the humor on Facebook and the local communities because of how many people I follow that live in the area go figure that the the jokes, the pictures, the memes, they are actually pretty damn funny.

07:44.400 --> 07:47.400
Getting high while you are actually high in the Mile High City?

07:47.400 --> 07:50.400
That's a new one to me, actually.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.400
I just like the one of the fog rolling in.

07:52.400 --> 07:53.400
Yes. Yes.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.400
Suddenly in Colorado.

07:55.400 --> 08:05.400
Well, my my my favorite as well is the whole fact that, like, it's a fucking cruel joke that hostess closes the week after they legalize marijuana in two states.

08:05.400 --> 08:10.400
And it's like, what kind of fucking stupid business decision was that?

08:10.400 --> 08:13.400
Maybe you own Twinkies.

08:13.400 --> 08:15.400
You were sitting on a gold mine anyway.

08:16.400 --> 08:22.400
No, they were too busy giving themselves raises and not worrying about things like benefits.

08:22.400 --> 08:23.400
All right. All right.

08:23.400 --> 08:24.400
And pensions.

08:24.400 --> 08:26.400
Fucking greedy ass fuckers.

08:26.400 --> 08:40.400
But since we're all look, since we're all like under the age of like 50, I'm sure we can agree that yay to those states that finally voted the right way and either legalized or stop the banning of, you know, marriage and all that.

08:40.400 --> 08:41.400
So, of course.

08:41.400 --> 08:42.400
Yay to Washington and all that.

08:42.400 --> 08:48.400
It makes it more difficult because we have to watch out for for state officials.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.400
We don't have to watch out for state officials.

08:50.400 --> 08:59.400
But when we hear about a federal raid, then it becomes a little bit more dangerous because as the disclaimer goes, it is still illegal at the federal level, which ultimately supersedes state law.

08:59.400 --> 09:01.400
All right. Anyhow, we got to get to video games.

09:01.400 --> 09:02.400
It's been a busy week in video games.

09:02.400 --> 09:04.400
We're getting too political.

09:04.400 --> 09:05.400
Let's pause. Shut up.

09:05.400 --> 09:06.400
Don't talk about politics.

09:06.400 --> 09:08.400
I tuned in here about games.

09:08.400 --> 09:10.400
Fine. We can talk games.

09:10.400 --> 09:14.400
Let's talk about Wii U, obviously.

09:14.400 --> 09:21.400
Everybody's heard that joke, but in part to Bobby, who does the show before us every week.

09:21.400 --> 09:24.400
But Big Day in Nintendo World, the Wii U launched.

09:24.400 --> 09:26.400
How are we feeling about the Wii U?

09:26.400 --> 09:29.400
So I teased before the show.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.400
One of us did get the Wii U.

09:31.400 --> 09:35.400
Jason, was it you?

09:35.400 --> 09:37.400
No, I've been busy in California.

09:37.400 --> 09:39.400
Dark Soccer, did you buy the Wii U?

09:39.400 --> 09:40.400
I'm not a whore.

09:40.400 --> 09:43.400
So that means it's between Loki and myself.

09:43.400 --> 09:46.400
Now, Loki, you do work for the distribution company.

09:46.400 --> 09:48.400
I do work for a distribution company.

09:48.400 --> 09:52.400
And you've been shading the shit out of Nintendo on the past few episodes of the show.

09:52.400 --> 09:53.400
That's true.

09:53.400 --> 09:56.400
Did you have a change of heart and did you buy a Wii U?

09:56.400 --> 09:58.400
No, I already own a Wii.

09:58.400 --> 10:01.400
Yes, it was me. I bought the Wii U this morning.

10:01.400 --> 10:02.400
Surprise.

10:02.400 --> 10:03.400
I did. Yep.

10:03.400 --> 10:06.400
So let's talk about the Wii U a little bit.

10:06.400 --> 10:09.400
I guess I'll start since, you know, I actually have one.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.400
No, here's the thing.

10:10.400 --> 10:14.400
I went back and forth on that Wii U thing a lot.

10:14.400 --> 10:17.400
I made a very cryptic tweet last night talking about...

10:17.400 --> 10:18.400
Because here's the thing.

10:18.400 --> 10:23.400
I chose not to go out and stand in line and all that stuff for the Wii U last night

10:23.400 --> 10:27.400
because Irene, who a lot of you old school OLR listeners know,

10:27.400 --> 10:28.400
she used to be on the show all the time.

10:28.400 --> 10:31.400
Irene was visiting and...

10:31.400 --> 10:33.400
I'm trying to make it sound like she doesn't live here,

10:33.400 --> 10:35.400
but she came over and we went out for her birthday.

10:35.400 --> 10:40.400
So I chose to go get drunk at a gay bar rather than go stand out in line.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.400
I think I made the right decision.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.400
So I pretty much convinced myself, you know what?

10:44.400 --> 10:45.400
I don't need a Wii U.

10:45.400 --> 10:46.400
I'm not going to get one.

10:46.400 --> 10:47.400
I'm over it.

10:47.400 --> 10:49.400
You know, I'll get one in January or whatever.

10:49.400 --> 10:56.400
And then this morning, I fire up the Target app and I just look out of curiosity.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.400
It's like 11 o'clock.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.400
They're still in stock at the store nearby.

11:00.400 --> 11:02.400
Let's just go take a look.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.400
Walk out of there with my Wii U Deluxe set.

11:04.400 --> 11:05.400
Not only are you a whore...

11:05.400 --> 11:06.400
I found one at noon.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.400
I found one at noon, still on a shelf in Target.

11:08.400 --> 11:11.400
Not only are you a whore, you're a waffling whore.

11:11.400 --> 11:16.400
So they're not sold out like the Wii.

11:16.400 --> 11:17.400
Oh, I guess...

11:17.400 --> 11:20.400
They probably are now, to be fair, because there were two left and I bought one.

11:20.400 --> 11:21.400
So...

11:21.400 --> 11:24.400
See, Nintendo, Apple helps you sell your stuff.

11:24.400 --> 11:27.400
If you're going to pick any mobile platform, Apple.

11:27.400 --> 11:29.400
I'm sure that isn't a surprise to hear me say ever.

11:29.400 --> 11:32.400
So to be honest, I've only really been able to spend like 30 minutes

11:32.400 --> 11:34.400
playing actual games on the console.

11:34.400 --> 11:37.400
Because as I'm sure you all heard, there's that massive 5 gigabyte update.

11:37.400 --> 11:39.400
And that took an hour out.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.400
And you know, I had to do other stuff to prep for the show.

11:41.400 --> 11:44.400
So I didn't have a whole lot of time to really sit down with the Wii U.

11:44.400 --> 11:45.400
But I'm going to tell you like this.

11:45.400 --> 11:50.400
This is the impression I got of the Wii U with the little time I had playing it.

11:50.400 --> 11:53.400
You know, this isn't a reference everybody's going to get.

11:53.400 --> 11:57.400
If you live in Northern California, you know the Winchester Mystery House.

11:58.400 --> 12:03.400
Dar Sacra, for those that don't live in Northern California, please explain the Winchester Mystery House.

12:03.400 --> 12:05.400
The Winchester Mystery House is in San Jose.

12:05.400 --> 12:10.400
It was built by this lady named Sarah Winchester, who was married to the Mr. Winchester,

12:10.400 --> 12:12.400
who made all the guns and killed people.

12:12.400 --> 12:14.400
Well, his guns killed people.

12:14.400 --> 12:20.400
And, well, she thought she was being haunted by the ghost of everyone who had ever died with one of the Winchester rifles.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.400
So she went to a medium who said,

12:22.400 --> 12:25.400
Yeah, you're being haunted, so you have to build a house to trap all the ghosts in.

12:25.400 --> 12:27.400
And if you stop building, you'll die.

12:27.400 --> 12:34.400
Well, she built a house seven stories tall, with all these rooms and construction never stopped during her life.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.400
Until she died, then construction stopped.

12:36.400 --> 12:40.400
The top three floors were knocked off during an earthquake.

12:40.400 --> 12:44.400
And now the rest of it's been turned into sort of a tourist trap.

12:44.400 --> 12:45.400
But it's a really neat house.

12:45.400 --> 12:47.400
There's stairs that go into the ceiling.

12:47.400 --> 12:52.400
She has very small doors, and because Ms. Winchester had horrible arthritis and was very short,

12:52.400 --> 12:56.400
she has these little tiny steps that go in spirals all through the house.

12:56.400 --> 13:00.400
There's a seance room that has, I think, seven doors in and no doors out.

13:00.400 --> 13:03.400
There's a door that opens just to the outside from the second story.

13:03.400 --> 13:05.400
Oops, dead.

13:05.400 --> 13:08.400
There's a huge basement. People see ghosts there, all kinds of stuff.

13:08.400 --> 13:12.400
So there's a reason I have Dark Sakura tell that story, because that's how I kind of feel about the Wii U,

13:12.400 --> 13:15.400
is that, like, there's these doors that you'll open and there's a wall there.

13:15.400 --> 13:18.400
And there'll be, like, a half-finished tunnel.

13:18.400 --> 13:23.400
And it's like, oh, you can click on Amazon Prime, and then it's like, surprise, it's fucking nothing.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.400
You know, like that gif.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.400
It's like, there's all these weird, unfinished things.

13:27.400 --> 13:32.400
And I really feel like so much of the infrastructure, they're building as they go along.

13:32.400 --> 13:35.400
Like, it was some mandate within Nintendo.

13:35.400 --> 13:39.400
That fucking thing is coming out on November 18th, come hell or high water,

13:39.400 --> 13:41.400
no matter what has to happen to make that happen.

13:41.400 --> 13:44.400
So there's still a lot of unfinished stuff.

13:44.400 --> 13:48.400
But, Loki, before you get your smart-ass comment out, I'm going to say on the plus side,

13:48.400 --> 13:54.400
getting to play Mario in HD, with what little time I spent with it so far,

13:54.400 --> 13:57.400
it's a pretty solid Mario game, and I'm really enjoying it.

13:57.400 --> 14:04.400
And just kind of like, wow, it looks great, and it plays neat, and so far I'm enjoying it.

14:04.400 --> 14:13.400
I also really love the subtle touch of the music being different on the television and on the Wii U gamepad.

14:13.400 --> 14:17.400
Like, it is really cute how, like, some instruments will be on the TV and some are on the gamepad.

14:17.400 --> 14:22.400
It creates this really neat 3D sound that you don't really have anywhere else.

14:22.400 --> 14:26.400
And it's kind of a neat little, it's a neat little thing. I like that.

14:26.400 --> 14:31.400
So yes, Loki, I know you're dying to comment on my consumer horridom, so please.

14:31.400 --> 14:35.400
No, I'm just saying that I don't know why you're surprised that there's stuff that's not finished for the Wii U launch.

14:35.400 --> 14:40.400
They did the same thing with the Wii, the DS, the 3DS, it's just Nintendo.

14:40.400 --> 14:45.400
And they're, well, we want people to buy our stuff, but oh hey, it's not complete.

14:45.400 --> 14:50.400
You know, all those wonderful features that we were pimping out during our E3 conferences,

14:50.400 --> 14:54.400
hey, TV, Nintendo TV, nope, not fucking there.

14:54.400 --> 15:00.400
Oh hey, Rayman Legends, really awesome launch game, launch window, by launch window he means coming out five months later.

15:00.400 --> 15:03.400
I mean, come on.

15:03.400 --> 15:08.400
At the end of the day though, what's the rule, the system is only as good as the games that are on it, blah blah blah, right?

15:08.400 --> 15:12.400
So how solid are the games? And I think the question you have to ask yourself is do you need this new Mario game,

15:12.400 --> 15:15.400
because that's clearly the all-star out of the bunch, I think for most people.

15:15.400 --> 15:19.400
Although ZombiU, a lot of people are saying really nice things about that.

15:19.400 --> 15:24.400
I haven't played it myself, but I'm hearing if you like old school Resident Evil games.

15:24.400 --> 15:29.400
And then Nintendo Land, your typical pack-in game.

15:29.400 --> 15:34.400
You know, I only did a little bit of Nintendo Land, but I like some of the variety in some of the games.

15:35.400 --> 15:41.400
I don't think Wii Sports level is going to draw people in, but I think it's a neat way to show off the console.

15:41.400 --> 15:48.400
I did a video chat too with Shane, and it's okay.

15:48.400 --> 15:51.400
I mean, the quality is kind of comparable to FaceTime.

15:51.400 --> 15:57.400
It's a little slow to connect, and then it does this really weird transition thing when you connect to the other person,

15:57.400 --> 16:00.400
where it ripples in, and it plays this music like,

16:01.400 --> 16:06.400
It's like this big debut, like, oh my god, I'm going to video chat!

16:06.400 --> 16:11.400
And then like, oh hey, it's Shane. I haven't seen him before.

16:11.400 --> 16:16.400
It's just like, oh, your princess is in another castle, but here's Shane.

16:20.400 --> 16:21.400
Poor Shane.

16:21.400 --> 16:27.400
But the quality was good enough that I could see his doggy running down the stairs in the back of the room,

16:27.400 --> 16:32.400
and I was like, oh, although when he was looking at my setup,

16:32.400 --> 16:36.400
Jason was sitting back here at the table, and I'm like, Shane, say hi to Jason.

16:36.400 --> 16:40.400
He's like, hi, he's doing that whole, I don't know who I'm saying hi to,

16:40.400 --> 16:43.400
and he told me later, he's like, yeah, I couldn't see Jason,

16:43.400 --> 16:47.400
but I could totally make out the Wendy's bag that was sitting on the table, so I know where he ate dinner.

16:50.400 --> 16:53.400
And that's how I really want to be remembered. My last meal.

16:54.400 --> 17:01.400
And then you can draw on it, but, you know, so I was writing, like, hello, and all that stupid stuff.

17:01.400 --> 17:06.400
So anyway, my time with the Wii U has been interesting so far.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.400
I think they're going to kind of keep adding to it.

17:08.400 --> 17:13.400
And at the end of the day, if you want a Wii U, you just have to ask yourself, how bad do I want the games?

17:13.400 --> 17:16.400
Because the infrastructure right now is not really where it's at.

17:16.400 --> 17:22.400
Like, there's still a lot of, like, I want to be able to explain Miiverse to all of you.

17:22.400 --> 17:27.400
I don't fucking understand it at all. Like, I thought it was supposed to be like Twitter,

17:27.400 --> 17:31.400
but you don't really make public posts. You can either send messages to people,

17:31.400 --> 17:36.400
or you comment on community posts, which in turn are public.

17:36.400 --> 17:39.400
And people, like, I don't fucking get it.

17:39.400 --> 17:45.400
It's okay. Nintendo doesn't fucking get it either. They just put this shit together and, like, done.

17:45.400 --> 17:51.400
It looks like Facebook or Twitter. We're gonna just say this is our online network right here.

17:52.400 --> 17:55.400
Raginator in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,

17:55.400 --> 17:58.400
So, what was the TTP for the newer listeners?

17:58.400 --> 18:02.400
It's an old OLR acronym for Time to Penis. Whenever there is a new piece of hardware,

18:02.400 --> 18:05.400
we always measure what's going to be the time before somebody puts their dick in it.

18:05.400 --> 18:07.400
Oh, I'm sure it was a few seconds.

18:07.400 --> 18:10.400
No, because he's asking, what was the TTP with the video chat?

18:10.400 --> 18:15.400
Shane and I don't, we're just friends, so that was not a thing. Sorry.

18:15.400 --> 18:16.400
But I'm sure somebody else-

18:16.400 --> 18:20.400
But Rob totally had a penis up on his iPhone.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.400
I'm kidding. I don't know.

18:22.400 --> 18:26.400
I'm like, I did? Maybe if I was looking at porn. I don't know. Alright, anyway.

18:26.400 --> 18:28.400
But, yeah, that wasn't part of it.

18:28.400 --> 18:32.400
So, let's see. Tigerclaw says,

18:32.400 --> 18:37.400
One thing's for sure. Expect Rob to post nothing but kiddie pics on the Wii U.

18:37.400 --> 18:44.400
I would love to post a broad- like, I would- if you want to follow me on the Miiverse thing,

18:44.400 --> 18:47.400
although I'm not sure what that will accomplish, but I'm Rob Roberts.

18:47.400 --> 18:50.400
So, all one word, Rob Roberts, so you can follow me or whatever.

18:50.400 --> 18:56.400
And I'll be happy to post kiddie pictures publicly, but I can't- like, it won't let me do it.

18:56.400 --> 19:01.400
Like, I don't know how- like, unless I go randomly reply to some community message,

19:01.400 --> 19:06.400
like, oh, no one care about the Skylanders community, let me just go post my kiddie pics here.

19:06.400 --> 19:12.400
Like, we need- all the Nintendo communities in Miiverse right now are just game communities.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.400
Like, I need a kiddie community.

19:15.400 --> 19:19.400
Where's my lolcat community? Anyhow.

19:19.400 --> 19:24.400
Well, they don't understand online. It's just- it's the way it is.

19:24.400 --> 19:29.400
Yeah, now they have online. They have something that sort of resembles what we had last generation.

19:29.400 --> 19:35.400
You know, if we're gonna consider this another generation, but they just don't get it still.

19:35.400 --> 19:41.400
And, I don't know, it's just- enjoy, I guess.

19:41.400 --> 19:47.400
I'm gonna be honest. I'm gonna be honest. My early thought, and keep in mind, early impressions can sometimes change.

19:47.400 --> 19:50.400
So here's my disclaimer. This is my early thought.

19:50.400 --> 19:56.400
I kind of think the Wii U is not- I mean, it's not a next-gen system. It's not.

19:56.400 --> 20:00.400
It is more the pinnacle of this generation.

20:01.400 --> 20:05.400
I get what they're trying to do with the whole controller thing. It is kind of a neat experience.

20:05.400 --> 20:08.400
I'll give them that. It's, you know, I hazed it a lot earlier on.

20:08.400 --> 20:15.400
But that tablet is really fucking crystal clear, and it does enhance some of the games. It's pretty neat.

20:15.400 --> 20:25.400
But I'm not sure, like, I really don't feel like I am in the next gen of gaming, or this is really pushing the envelope as far as graphics and everything go.

20:25.400 --> 20:30.400
No, it's more like Nintendo's finally playing catch-up. Yay, they're caught up. You know?

20:30.400 --> 20:31.400
Until next year.

20:31.400 --> 20:36.400
Now I get to finally play Mario in HD and so forth. So, at least that's where I'm at right now.

20:36.400 --> 20:41.400
Rama in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Reggie said it wasn't next gen.

20:41.400 --> 20:50.400
And you know, that's a fair response, because we as gamers make all this shit a competition sometimes.

20:50.400 --> 20:56.400
You know, and Nintendo is trying to say, wait a minute, wait a minute, no, we're not a next gen, we're the other gen.

20:56.400 --> 20:59.400
It was the exact same thing with the Wii. It was the exact same thing with the Wii.

20:59.400 --> 21:03.400
That's just an easy way to argue that your system sucks. I mean, it's-

21:03.400 --> 21:04.400
Well, hold on though.

21:04.400 --> 21:09.400
Oh, we're not competing with anybody, we're in our own market, therefore we're number one. I mean, that's stupid.

21:09.400 --> 21:15.400
But the Wii sold more than PlayStations and Xboxes, that is fact. You cannot dispute that.

21:15.400 --> 21:19.400
The Wii was the winner of those last three consoles. Whether you like it or not, that's the way it is.

21:19.400 --> 21:24.400
Well, it's because they had a great pack-in game, everyone bought it. Not gonna happen this generation though.

21:24.400 --> 21:28.400
Nothing wrong with that last generation, but I think I agree with him about the Wii U.

21:29.400 --> 21:38.400
And I think I said as much when I called after I was at the launch experience, is that because of the higher tier in order to actually have a pack-in,

21:38.400 --> 21:44.400
and the fact that there is not something that you just drop into, it's been forever since I played Wii Sports,

21:44.400 --> 21:50.400
you turn it on, you pick a game, and you start playing. There are a lot more hurdles from what I've seen of the Wii U,

21:50.400 --> 21:55.400
and that's unfortunately quite detrimental to the commoner.

21:55.400 --> 22:01.400
The thing with the Wii U is that they assume they're really targeting this at people that bought Wiis.

22:01.400 --> 22:07.400
They're not targeting this at new consumers, because if you're a new consumer, then guess what?

22:07.400 --> 22:12.400
You can't play multiplayer, because you got one fucking controller and no other controllers with it.

22:12.400 --> 22:16.400
You have to go buy all those $40 controllers, and all the nunchucks that go along with that,

22:16.400 --> 22:23.400
and all the other accessories that you need to play those games, because once again, they marketed this at people that own the Wii.

22:23.400 --> 22:31.400
And those people that own the Wii, some of whom, yes, will buy the system, but you're not gonna see old folks' homes or anything like that,

22:31.400 --> 22:36.400
purchasing this to play Nintendo Land, no one's gonna give a fuck, because they're playing Wii Sports still.

22:36.400 --> 22:41.400
I just, you know what, okay, I gotta wrap up, because I gotta go to the next thing, because we have another big thing coming up,

22:41.400 --> 22:43.400
even before gaming weeks, we got another big thing.

22:43.400 --> 22:46.400
And you know, I seriously have nothing to say about any of this.

22:46.400 --> 22:48.400
Really? As a gamer, you have no opinion?

22:48.400 --> 22:51.400
Because I don't have one, probably not gonna get one.

22:52.400 --> 22:55.400
I mean, yeah, it's nice. I told Dan I kinda wanted one.

22:55.400 --> 22:59.400
You know, but I can't talk about something that I don't own.

22:59.400 --> 23:04.400
And it's also, it's not something, and I say this to everybody, it's not something you really, like, have to have.

23:04.400 --> 23:09.400
No. I mean, like, you know what I'm more excited about? Fucking Omega.

23:10.400 --> 23:11.400
And that's what you're into.

23:11.400 --> 23:12.400
Yeah.

23:12.400 --> 23:15.400
Here's the thing, here's the thing, and I wanna kind of start to wrap this up, and I wanna make this comment,

23:15.400 --> 23:18.400
is that, you know, despite all of that that you guys are saying with Wii U,

23:18.400 --> 23:21.400
I really think this thing is down a similar path as 3DS.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.400
And I realize 3DS to some extent is struggling as well,

23:24.400 --> 23:27.400
but I think Wii U is gonna gain a lot of steam next holiday,

23:27.400 --> 23:30.400
because you know that big holiday game's coming out,

23:30.400 --> 23:34.400
that Zelda's coming out next Christmas, or the big Metroid or something.

23:34.400 --> 23:38.400
There will be a huge game, and one thing Nintendo does very well,

23:38.400 --> 23:42.400
the characters in the story, love it or not, they have rabid fans.

23:42.400 --> 23:46.400
And that's gonna sway a lot of people to picking those up even next holiday,

23:46.400 --> 23:51.400
even with new Xbox and new PlayStation possibly out on the market.

23:51.400 --> 23:53.400
And I guess this is a whole other can of worms.

23:53.400 --> 23:55.400
I think we'll have new Xbox.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.400
I'm not so sure right now we're gonna have a new PlayStation next year.

23:57.400 --> 24:00.400
I don't see why they should be in a rush.

24:00.400 --> 24:03.400
Why should there be a new Xbox by the same token?

24:03.400 --> 24:06.400
Honestly, I don't think it's really gonna be, they're not gonna be worried about it,

24:06.400 --> 24:10.400
because the longer they take on their systems, the better they're gonna be.

24:10.400 --> 24:14.400
And if you think about it, if they're, okay, let's just say this system is not next-gen,

24:14.400 --> 24:16.400
this system is current-gen.

24:16.400 --> 24:18.400
How are you gonna compete against the Xbox?

24:18.400 --> 24:22.400
The Xbox, or the PlayStation 3 for that matter, they have a huge library of games,

24:22.400 --> 24:24.400
and they're probably gonna be cheaper.

24:24.400 --> 24:26.400
So, why should I?

24:26.400 --> 24:30.400
And that's the other problem too, is like, I have an Xbox 360 and a PlayStation 3,

24:30.400 --> 24:33.400
and even if I just had one of those, there's no need for me to buy a Wii U,

24:33.400 --> 24:37.400
unless I really want to play New Super Mario Brothers in HD,

24:37.400 --> 24:40.400
which, you know, it's kind of like, you know,

24:40.400 --> 24:45.400
I probably would have already played it on the Wii, or on the 3DS, or on the DS.

24:45.400 --> 24:51.400
And it's just not that, no, it's just like throwing a fresh coat of paint on an old game.

24:51.400 --> 24:52.400
It's fun.

24:52.400 --> 24:57.400
Yeah, cool, Mario games are fun, and I can play New Super Mario Brothers on the Wii,

24:57.400 --> 24:59.400
on the 3DS, on the DS.

24:59.400 --> 25:07.400
I don't need to buy a brand new system for $350, plus the game, to play it.

25:07.400 --> 25:10.400
Play it, it's not worth $410.

25:10.400 --> 25:15.400
Alright, we have a whole nother year to debate this shit until the next console comes out.

25:15.400 --> 25:18.400
I do want to transition to something else here, Jason, final thought.

25:18.400 --> 25:25.400
Um, long-term claim chowder, because of his kid, Loki's gonna be surprisingly in Nintendo camp in about four years, five years?

25:25.400 --> 25:28.400
Nah, he'll train the kid to love Call of Duty.

25:28.400 --> 25:30.400
He's not gonna love Call of Duty.

25:30.400 --> 25:33.400
He can love whatever he wants, but that still doesn't matter.

25:33.400 --> 25:36.400
Because if he wants to play a Mario game, guess what?

25:36.400 --> 25:41.400
There's the Nintendo, there's the Super Nintendo, there's the Game Boy, there's the DS, there's the Wii.

25:41.400 --> 25:44.400
I have plenty of Nintendo consoles to play all these stupid games.

25:44.400 --> 25:49.400
I don't need to buy a brand new system to play New Super Mario Brothers with a fresh coat of paint.

25:49.400 --> 25:50.400
No, forget it.

25:50.400 --> 25:52.400
Yet you already have that many of them.

25:52.400 --> 25:55.400
No, I don't have those systems, but I have emulators.

25:55.400 --> 26:01.400
I can emulate all those systems and I have a Wii, which, let's see, the last time I played that Wii was a few years ago.

26:01.400 --> 26:05.400
Well, actually it was a couple months ago, but that was my wife playing the Wii.

26:05.400 --> 26:10.400
Alright, we're gonna go to a call, because we're gonna go have a chat with Rama.

26:10.400 --> 26:15.400
And I believe he has a friend there with him, too, from...

26:15.400 --> 26:17.400
Hi, you there, Rama?

26:17.400 --> 26:18.400
I'm right here.

26:18.400 --> 26:21.400
Hey, and you have a buddy with you, right? From AJS?

26:21.400 --> 26:24.400
Yeah, hold on for one second, I'm gonna bring him right in.

26:24.400 --> 26:25.400
And he's right there.

26:25.400 --> 26:29.400
Oh, hey, look at that. Conference call on Skype. Hey, how you doing?

26:29.400 --> 26:31.400
Doing fabulous.

26:31.400 --> 26:34.400
This is... Forgive me if I'm saying this wrong, Taiki?

26:34.400 --> 26:35.400
Taiki.

26:35.400 --> 26:37.400
Taiki, how you doing?

26:37.400 --> 26:38.400
Fabulous. Fantastic.

26:38.400 --> 26:41.400
Awesome. So you guys were at the launch event last night, right?

26:41.400 --> 26:43.400
That's correct, sir.

26:43.400 --> 26:50.400
And so I'm guessing, you know, all them media cameras were everywhere and it was hype, hype, hype, hype. Was it hype, hype, hype?

26:50.400 --> 26:52.400
No.

26:52.400 --> 26:55.400
To me it was a lot of hype and a lot of the chill, chill, chill.

26:55.400 --> 26:56.400
Yeah?

26:56.400 --> 27:13.400
Well, from what I observed, some media, but you know how media goes. It was a little directed. Nintendo told them where to go, what to shoot, at least as far as I could tell.

27:13.400 --> 27:22.400
There was a lot going on in the crowd, but it seemed like the media really didn't want to be there.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.400
Wow.

27:24.400 --> 27:26.400
That was my, that was my, that's my opinion.

27:26.400 --> 27:33.400
You know what though? From my limited time when I was studying to be originally in college, I was going to be a broadcast journalist. Here I am.

27:33.400 --> 27:43.400
That doesn't surprise me. They get very unenthusiastic about a lot of things. I think it's just, you know, you build up a resistance to hype, you know, but anyway.

27:43.400 --> 27:44.400
Right.

27:44.400 --> 27:53.400
So you guys both went as media to cover it and so forth for AJS and OLR, but did you guys walk out of there with one? Rama?

27:53.400 --> 27:54.400
No.

27:54.400 --> 27:55.400
No? Taiki?

27:55.400 --> 27:56.400
Nope.

27:56.400 --> 27:58.400
No? What, what made you not want to do it?

27:58.400 --> 28:08.400
I had to go see my folks next, next month. So between, between that, yeah. Plus I would also be massively jumping the line, although that would have been great.

28:08.400 --> 28:10.400
Oh, did they sell out that night?

28:10.400 --> 28:24.400
No, but there was a considerable line. After the event ended, we all went to McDonald's to get a little, to get a little nosh. And when we left heading back to the train station, we noticed that there were still about, I would say about 50 to 100 people still in line.

28:24.400 --> 28:25.400
Wow.

28:25.400 --> 28:26.400
Yeah.

28:26.400 --> 28:37.400
And from my knowledge, the line went up until about five o'clock in the morning because some people on my Facebook, oh, let's just say one of my friends kind of went home dejected.

28:37.400 --> 28:39.400
Oh, ouch.

28:39.400 --> 28:50.400
That's unfortunate. All right. Well, you guys are at the event and you guys got some interviews and so forth. So we want to play those here on the show. So tell us about what I'm playing.

28:50.400 --> 28:55.400
Well, the ones with the market share, that was Taiki's idea. Taiki, you take that one.

28:55.400 --> 29:13.400
Okay. So we were at the Duane Reade across the street from the Nintendo World Store, you know, preparing. We had about four hours to go. So I'm thinking, it's time for some Red Bull. So we leave and I'm looking at the line and I was thinking there's probably something interesting, something interesting here.

29:13.400 --> 29:21.400
I mean, he's got a lot of people here who obviously enjoy fun. Let's bring it down a little. Let's do something a little more fun.

29:21.400 --> 29:38.400
My thought was we need to do something with these people in line. And, you know, you've seen those segments on Conan where they send someone like Triumph or whoever to the line and they start, you know, I was thinking we need to do something like that, but not insulting, but very funny and very much inside gaming.

29:38.400 --> 29:55.400
So my idea was let's start asking people who, you know, look like they're a little older, who will know older consoles. What will the Wii U do to the market share for, say, the Dreamcast or the Neo Geo or the Jaguar?

29:55.400 --> 30:03.400
All right. Let's check out some of these interviews with people and gauging the impact of the Wii U on the market share.

30:03.400 --> 30:06.400
We found this man in line. What is your name, sir?

30:07.400 --> 30:09.400
John, but you can call me the Hux.

30:09.400 --> 30:14.400
The Hux? Interesting. So Wii U, what do you think?

30:14.400 --> 30:23.400
It looks like a very interesting console. Good innovation. I'm really impressed with the changes they've made to the network specifically.

30:23.400 --> 30:30.400
But some of the launch titles look good. I'm sure it's only going to go uphill from here. And I'm really impressed with the controller as well.

30:30.400 --> 30:36.400
Okay. And speaking of the controller, how do you think that the Wii U is going to impact the Dreamcast market share?

30:36.400 --> 30:43.400
The Dreamcast market share. Dreamcast is probably the best system, number one. And all I know is if I want to...

30:43.400 --> 30:46.400
You're very brave saying that in front of the Nintendo World Store, sir.

30:46.400 --> 30:59.400
Hey. Dreamcast. Go buy one. Buy some CD-ROMs. Go get a disc burner. I don't know what you're going to do. Put some games on there. Play that up.

30:59.400 --> 31:05.400
This man knows what's up. This man knows what's up.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.400
Your name, sir? Jason.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.400
Jason, what do you think of the Wii U?

31:10.400 --> 31:14.400
I'm really excited for the Wii U. I've always been a hardcore Nintendo fan, so...

31:14.400 --> 31:19.400
What do you think of the new controller? I think it's awesome, dude. I think it's a big step forward in gaming in general.

31:19.400 --> 31:24.400
So, what do you think that the Wii U is going to do to the TurboGrafx-16's market share?

31:25.400 --> 31:27.400
So, that's a serious question?

31:27.400 --> 31:29.400
Dead serious.

31:29.400 --> 31:32.400
You know what? I'm not even worried about market shares.

31:32.400 --> 31:37.400
So, wait a minute. We've got a new Mario game. How do you think that's going to compare to Bonk?

31:37.400 --> 31:41.400
I mean, Bonk has its place. You can't take that away from Bonk.

31:41.400 --> 31:44.400
The man knows the stuff. Let's go.

31:44.400 --> 31:46.400
And your name, sir?

31:46.400 --> 31:48.400
My name is Plino Bozzato.

31:48.400 --> 31:51.400
Alright, and what do you think of the Wii U?

31:51.400 --> 31:56.400
I think it's going to be awesome. I'm really excited about that. I really am.

31:56.400 --> 31:58.400
What do you think of the new controller?

31:58.400 --> 32:02.400
I think it's very innovative. It's fresh.

32:02.400 --> 32:08.400
And it's nice because after the Wii, which was very innovative and brought something new,

32:08.400 --> 32:13.400
I think this controller is a follow-up and it's really nice. Can't wait.

32:13.400 --> 32:17.400
What do you think that the Wii U is going to do to the Neo Geo's market share?

32:17.400 --> 32:25.400
Oh, wow. I don't have an idea. I hope it's going to keep the leadership that we brought.

32:25.400 --> 32:27.400
I don't know.

32:27.400 --> 32:28.400
Thank you.

32:28.400 --> 32:29.400
You're welcome.

32:29.400 --> 32:30.400
My name is Kim.

32:30.400 --> 32:33.400
Hi, Kim. What do you think of the Wii U?

32:33.400 --> 32:36.400
I think it's amazing. I can't wait to play it. I'm so excited.

32:36.400 --> 32:38.400
So what do you think of the new Wii U controller?

32:38.400 --> 32:44.400
It's actually very light. I've played it before, so it's surprisingly light and it's just amazing.

32:44.400 --> 32:46.400
It brings the whole game to life.

32:46.400 --> 32:50.400
So what do you think that the Wii U is going to do to the Sega Saturn's market share?

32:50.400 --> 32:52.400
Sega Saturn?

32:52.400 --> 32:54.400
Sega Saturn.

32:54.400 --> 33:00.400
Panzer Dragoon, Virtuon, Virtua Fighter.

33:00.400 --> 33:02.400
Your name, sir?

33:02.400 --> 33:03.400
Carlos Rivera.

33:03.400 --> 33:05.400
Carlos, what do you think of the Wii U?

33:05.400 --> 33:10.400
Oh, I'm very excited about it. I've been reading up on it since they announced it was going to come out,

33:10.400 --> 33:13.400
and that's why I'm here now, to get it.

33:13.400 --> 33:15.400
Excellent, excellent. What do you think of the new controller?

33:15.400 --> 33:19.400
Oh, I love the tablet controller. I love the fact that it's a tablet.

33:19.400 --> 33:24.400
You can play the games on it, other than your screen. I love that.

33:24.400 --> 33:27.400
What do you think this is going to do to the Atari Jaguar's market share?

33:27.400 --> 33:32.400
The Atari Jaguar has that 16 numpad button controller.

33:32.400 --> 33:34.400
Well...

33:34.400 --> 33:35.400
That was pretty innovative.

33:35.400 --> 33:41.400
It was pretty innovative, but I'm going to be looking into that too, of course.

33:41.400 --> 33:42.400
Excellent, excellent.

33:42.400 --> 33:46.400
Do you think maybe that girl might have known what an N-Gage was?

33:46.400 --> 33:49.400
Maybe she should have checked on that market share. I don't know.

33:49.400 --> 33:52.400
She's like, what's a Sega Saturn? I don't know.

33:52.400 --> 33:55.400
That just makes me hurt in my heart.

33:55.400 --> 33:58.400
Please, no one remembered what the N-Gage was.

33:58.400 --> 34:02.400
I love the people in the background going, whoa, Wii U, whoa!

34:02.400 --> 34:04.400
Sega Saturn, I'm not into astronomy.

34:04.400 --> 34:06.400
I used to have an N-Gage.

34:06.400 --> 34:08.400
Yeah, I know.

34:08.400 --> 34:10.400
Yeah, we gave it away.

34:10.400 --> 34:14.400
So, Loki, I thought I saw you kind of twitching over there a little bit

34:14.400 --> 34:17.400
when they were asking about the tablets,

34:17.400 --> 34:19.400
and some of the people were kind of giving the same answer.

34:19.400 --> 34:22.400
So innovative, so different, so new, so fresh.

34:22.400 --> 34:25.400
No, that's not an answer. That's just like a canned answer.

34:25.400 --> 34:29.400
That is literally right there. That is subliminal advertising.

34:29.400 --> 34:34.400
Basically, they keep hearing it repeated to them that this is so innovative and stuff,

34:34.400 --> 34:37.400
and then they go and say, oh, yeah, it's so innovative.

34:37.400 --> 34:39.400
That's what they tell their friends.

34:39.400 --> 34:42.400
What is so fucking innovative about this tablet?

34:42.400 --> 34:45.400
Oh, it's a tablet that exists pretty much on everything right now.

34:45.400 --> 34:47.400
It is a shit ton better than SmartGlass, I'll tell you that.

34:47.400 --> 34:49.400
Oh, come on. That's just stupid.

34:49.400 --> 34:53.400
SmartGlass is just a glitchy app that's early in the development cycle right now.

34:53.400 --> 34:56.400
I mean, this is like the vision camera.

34:56.400 --> 34:58.400
Obviously, the vision camera is crap.

34:58.400 --> 35:00.400
Obviously, the Kinect camera right now is crap.

35:00.400 --> 35:04.400
So, yes, I expect SmartGlass to be kind of, eh, stupid.

35:04.400 --> 35:06.400
All right, what would you want to say, Rama?

35:06.400 --> 35:11.400
I said SmartGlass is nothing more than a fancy Wi-Fi remote for the 360.

35:11.400 --> 35:12.400
That's all it is.

35:13.400 --> 35:15.400
All right, well, before we get into that.

35:15.400 --> 35:18.400
So, tablets, all it is is on life for the Wii.

35:19.400 --> 35:20.400
Fair enough.

35:20.400 --> 35:23.400
Well, not really. I mean, the big difference that you'll see with the Wii.

35:23.400 --> 35:25.400
I think it's a huge difference too, but anyway.

35:25.400 --> 35:26.400
It's low latency, that's all.

35:26.400 --> 35:28.400
It's latency. It's low latency.

35:29.400 --> 35:31.400
Anyhow, all right, let's talk about some of these other interviews.

35:31.400 --> 35:34.400
Who else did you talk to while you were there at the show?

35:34.400 --> 35:39.400
Well, while we were discussing the whole market share little quip,

35:39.400 --> 35:43.400
we came across this one guy named Nick who does charity for one of his closest friends

35:43.400 --> 35:45.400
because they were on the line for the Wii,

35:45.400 --> 35:48.400
but unfortunately, his friend passed away from leukemia,

35:48.400 --> 35:51.400
so they do a chocolate charity in his honor every year.

35:51.400 --> 35:54.400
Oh, that's cool. I like that. Let's hear it from this guy.

35:54.400 --> 35:56.400
We found this man. Your name again, sir?

35:56.400 --> 35:58.400
My name is James Brief.

35:58.400 --> 36:05.400
James, do you have any particular connection to the Wii and Wii launch dates?

36:05.400 --> 36:11.400
Yeah, actually, my friends and I years ago were in the same line waiting for the Wii,

36:11.400 --> 36:17.400
and one of our friends, Nicholas Capobianco, since then, he passed away from leukemia,

36:17.400 --> 36:21.400
and every year since then, our friends, we get together like we did in the old days,

36:21.400 --> 36:25.400
and we have a gaming marathon where we play games.

36:25.400 --> 36:31.400
We can stream it live on the net at nixmarathon.org, and we raise money for Child's Play.

36:31.400 --> 36:35.400
It's a charity that raises money for pediatric hospitals.

36:35.400 --> 36:41.400
Very cool. Very reminiscent of Loading Ready Runs, Desert Bus for Hope.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.400
So I think that's very cool.

36:43.400 --> 36:46.400
Do you have any other comments about the Wii Wii U?

36:46.400 --> 36:48.400
Oh, looking forward to it.

36:48.400 --> 36:51.400
What do you think this is going to do to the GameCube's market share?

36:51.400 --> 36:54.400
I think connectivity is on its way back.

36:54.400 --> 36:55.400
Fabulous.

36:55.400 --> 36:57.400
The connectivity is on its way back.

36:57.400 --> 37:00.400
Well, that's a very noble cause. That's actually really awesome.

37:00.400 --> 37:04.400
So props to that guy. That's great, and the group of friends that do that.

37:04.400 --> 37:08.400
I hope if I inevitably leave this world too soon, you all will do something similar.

37:08.400 --> 37:09.400
I think that's great.

37:09.400 --> 37:11.400
You know we will, because we love you.

37:11.400 --> 37:12.400
I'll totally show in your honor.

37:12.400 --> 37:14.400
I'll totally start a charity to get me game systems.

37:14.400 --> 37:18.400
Stop. All right. Moving on.

37:18.400 --> 37:20.400
Who else did you guys talk to?

37:20.400 --> 37:24.400
Well, the next clip I called Wii U Gives Grilled Cheese Sandwiches,

37:24.400 --> 37:30.400
it seems that the staff was handing out drinks, food to everybody that's online.

37:30.400 --> 37:34.400
So as we were interviewing this one parent that's on the line for Wii U,

37:34.400 --> 37:37.400
staffer comes by, hands us grilled cheese sandwiches.

37:37.400 --> 37:39.400
So we're like, why not? Let's roll with it.

37:39.400 --> 37:41.400
Heck yeah. Let's hear this.

37:41.400 --> 37:43.400
Hey, DJ Ron Mess here.

37:43.400 --> 37:46.400
We are live, well sort of live, outside of Nintendo World

37:46.400 --> 37:51.400
with the thousands and thousands of the Nintendo's fans.

37:51.400 --> 37:52.400
Do you hear that?

37:52.400 --> 37:55.400
These people are psyched for a Wii U and you know what?

37:55.400 --> 37:58.400
The Wii U makes some real good grilled cheese sandwiches.

37:58.400 --> 38:00.400
Look at that. Look at that.

38:00.400 --> 38:01.400
Look at that.

38:01.400 --> 38:04.400
The Wii U makes really good grilled cheese sandwiches.

38:04.400 --> 38:08.400
Something that the PS3 could not do, that damn George Foreman grill.

38:08.400 --> 38:11.400
Now we're talking to some people out here about their thoughts about the Wii U

38:11.400 --> 38:14.400
and how long have you been on the line for this console?

38:14.400 --> 38:16.400
Since about 2 o'clock this afternoon.

38:16.400 --> 38:20.400
So you decided not to come out here like on a Monday or Tuesday and be like, I'm number one?

38:20.400 --> 38:23.400
I did have to work, but you know, somebody has to pay for the Wii U.

38:23.400 --> 38:25.400
True, but do you have kids?

38:25.400 --> 38:26.400
Yes.

38:26.400 --> 38:28.400
Did you think about sending the kids out here to hold the spot?

38:28.400 --> 38:30.400
Somebody has to go to school.

38:30.400 --> 38:32.400
Well, there's a will, there is a way.

38:32.400 --> 38:36.400
So tell me, is this the first time you were online for a game or a console like this?

38:36.400 --> 38:37.400
Yes.

38:37.400 --> 38:39.400
Why are you out here for this?

38:39.400 --> 38:40.400
Right here.

38:40.400 --> 38:43.400
Actually, I just wanted to see how crowded it would be.

38:43.400 --> 38:46.400
This is the best system.

38:46.400 --> 38:48.400
And as you can see, it is very crowded.

38:48.400 --> 38:50.400
It's just a thinned out version.

38:50.400 --> 38:53.400
So as you know, Christmas is right around the corner,

38:53.400 --> 38:58.400
so how much pressure are you under to get this console under the tree?

38:58.400 --> 39:00.400
Oh, a lot of pressure, a lot of pressure.

39:00.400 --> 39:02.400
I'm always under pressure every Christmas.

39:02.400 --> 39:04.400
How'd you set it up today?

39:04.400 --> 39:05.400
Today?

39:05.400 --> 39:08.400
Yeah, I don't care if I get back at midnight, I don't care.

39:08.400 --> 39:10.400
Well, I remember when the Super Nintendo came out,

39:10.400 --> 39:13.400
I played it and I was told, pack it up, put it back in the box,

39:13.400 --> 39:15.400
and put it back under the tree.

39:15.400 --> 39:17.400
No, it will go back under the tree.

39:17.400 --> 39:18.400
It will not.

39:18.400 --> 39:20.400
What if you just wrapped the empty...

39:20.400 --> 39:21.400
There you go.

39:21.400 --> 39:24.400
Have you thought about just wrapping just the empty box under the tree?

39:24.400 --> 39:25.400
It could work.

39:25.400 --> 39:27.400
I think that would be a good thing.

39:27.400 --> 39:29.400
So what games are you planning on getting out of here with?

39:29.400 --> 39:31.400
Right now, just Nintendo Land.

39:31.400 --> 39:34.400
I'm waiting for some of the other games to come out towards the end of this year.

39:34.400 --> 39:39.400
I'm going to buy a new Super Mario Bros. 2, Zombie U, maybe a little later after launch.

39:39.400 --> 39:42.400
Hey, that sounds like a plan, so thanks a lot for your time.

39:42.400 --> 39:43.400
Thank you.

39:43.400 --> 39:44.400
Arigato gozaimasu.

39:44.400 --> 39:45.400
Datashimashite.

39:45.400 --> 39:47.400
That was a very excited family.

39:47.400 --> 39:49.400
Did I hear her right?

39:49.400 --> 39:51.400
They set up the tree already?

39:51.400 --> 39:53.400
The tree is set up around the corner.

39:53.400 --> 39:56.400
The lighting ceremony is like sometimes this or next week.

39:56.400 --> 39:58.400
Oh, the Rockefeller tree. Right, right, right.

39:58.400 --> 39:59.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:59.400 --> 40:00.400
They usually do that over the Thanksgiving weekend.

40:00.400 --> 40:02.400
All right, I gotcha. I gotcha.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.400
All right, so what's this next one you got?

40:04.400 --> 40:08.400
Well, Link was online, so I had to ask him, you know, what his thoughts were,

40:08.400 --> 40:12.400
and did Zelda know that he left the castle?

40:12.400 --> 40:18.400
Hey, DJ Ron Mess here at Rockefeller Center right in front of Nintendo World.

40:18.400 --> 40:22.400
Take a look at that. That is an awesome view, ain't it?

40:22.400 --> 40:24.400
Beautiful. Beautiful.

40:24.400 --> 40:26.400
Right here, I'm chilling out with Link from Hyrule.

40:26.400 --> 40:28.400
Link, what's going on, brother?

40:28.400 --> 40:31.400
Just hanging out with my fellow diehard Nintendo fans

40:31.400 --> 40:34.400
and enjoying the night and having a good time.

40:34.400 --> 40:36.400
So what brings you here tonight, good friend?

40:36.400 --> 40:38.400
Wii U, obviously.

40:38.400 --> 40:41.400
What about the Wii U that you want so bad?

40:41.400 --> 40:45.400
Because Nintendo, man. That's all I got to say.

40:45.400 --> 40:46.400
Nintendo's the short answer.

40:46.400 --> 40:50.400
The long answer is I'm really excited about the new innovation

40:50.400 --> 40:54.400
that Nintendo's brought out with the new tablet controller.

40:54.400 --> 40:59.400
They always set the bar with everything that they do every generation.

40:59.400 --> 41:02.400
You know, they were the first for the joystick, the first for the shoulder buttons,

41:02.400 --> 41:04.400
the first for the rumble feature, the first for the motion,

41:04.400 --> 41:07.400
now they're the first for the touchscreen controller.

41:07.400 --> 41:10.400
And that's just what they do, and they do it best.

41:10.400 --> 41:13.400
Wow, this brother, he's diehard, really diehard.

41:13.400 --> 41:15.400
So, Link, let me ask you.

41:15.400 --> 41:21.400
If you're here online for the Wii U, who's watching Zelda?

41:22.400 --> 41:25.400
That's an excellent question.

41:25.400 --> 41:29.400
Here's the thing. Does she even know that you left the castle to be here?

41:29.400 --> 41:32.400
No, I snuck out for a couple days, actually, yeah.

41:32.400 --> 41:38.400
Well, I hope that Ganon doesn't try to roll up on your property, man.

41:38.400 --> 41:40.400
She has Sheik watching her, so she'll be all right.

41:40.400 --> 41:43.400
Sheik's a tough mother, you know.

41:43.400 --> 41:46.400
So Sheik is watching Zelda.

41:46.400 --> 41:48.400
Not Sheik, I'm sorry. Impa.

41:49.400 --> 41:51.400
Because Zelda is Sheik, I made a mistake.

41:51.400 --> 41:52.400
Impa's watching.

41:52.400 --> 41:54.400
An old woman is watching Zelda?

41:54.400 --> 41:57.400
Yeah, she's a Sheikah. She's tough.

41:57.400 --> 42:00.400
Well, you can't beat that kind of logic, so thank you, good sir.

42:00.400 --> 42:01.400
Thank you very much.

42:01.400 --> 42:02.400
Yep, thank you very much.

42:02.400 --> 42:03.400
Hey, no problem.

42:03.400 --> 42:06.400
So, Loki, I know that guy, you know, at first I was like,

42:06.400 --> 42:09.400
oh, he's just another kind of blind Nintendo fanboy.

42:09.400 --> 42:12.400
However, he made a pretty damn good point.

42:12.400 --> 42:15.400
Nintendo tends to set the bar with a lot of their shit.

42:15.400 --> 42:17.400
I know you were sitting there going, joystick?

42:17.400 --> 42:19.400
They didn't do the joystick, but they did.

42:19.400 --> 42:23.400
You can say that Nintendo set the bar for the modern gamepad.

42:23.400 --> 42:25.400
The Kinect would have never happened if it wasn't for the Wii.

42:25.400 --> 42:26.400
Thoughts?

42:26.400 --> 42:28.400
The Kinect would have happened.

42:28.400 --> 42:30.400
I mean, it's camera technology.

42:30.400 --> 42:34.400
The Kinect wouldn't have happened if the iToy hadn't happened.

42:34.400 --> 42:38.400
Well, I just think that they should have stuck with the Coleco's model.

42:38.400 --> 42:42.400
I miss my Intellivision pad.

42:43.400 --> 42:47.400
Is the Coleco the one where you put the plastic stuff on the TV?

42:47.400 --> 42:48.400
Or is it the fairchild?

42:48.400 --> 42:50.400
No, you didn't put it on the TV.

42:50.400 --> 42:52.400
You slid a little thing into the number pad.

42:52.400 --> 42:54.400
What was the thing that you would actually have to put the overlays on the television?

42:54.400 --> 42:55.400
Was that the fairchild?

42:55.400 --> 42:56.400
Odyssey.

42:56.400 --> 42:57.400
Odyssey, thank you.

42:57.400 --> 43:01.400
Well, you know, actually the Odyssey 2 didn't have,

43:01.400 --> 43:04.400
I had a couple games that used that, but not many that did.

43:04.400 --> 43:06.400
Alright, we still have a few more interviews to go,

43:06.400 --> 43:08.400
but you know I had to grill Loki on that.

43:08.400 --> 43:13.400
Sounds like a lot of really great fans there at the event, right?

43:13.400 --> 43:16.400
Oh yeah, especially the dancing Miis.

43:16.400 --> 43:18.400
Oh god, really?

43:18.400 --> 43:19.400
Yeah.

43:19.400 --> 43:21.400
Alright, what's this next interview we got?

43:21.400 --> 43:22.400
This is a quick one.

43:22.400 --> 43:25.400
Well, I had ran off to do something and I came back.

43:25.400 --> 43:28.400
Mario had picked up the microphone and started talking to people in the crowd,

43:28.400 --> 43:32.400
and me as Luigi, I had some words for him.

43:32.400 --> 43:34.400
So you were dressed as Black Luigi?

43:34.400 --> 43:35.400
Yes, I was.

43:35.400 --> 43:37.400
Alright, so this is Mario and Black Luigi. Here we go.

43:37.400 --> 43:40.400
What am I doing in the commentary? What are you doing, Luigi?

43:40.400 --> 43:42.400
I was also doing the commentary.

43:42.400 --> 43:45.400
Why are you not in your mansion? You're going to get scared by the ghosts.

43:45.400 --> 43:48.400
You should be off chasing after Peach again.

43:48.400 --> 43:52.400
I need a break. I always chase after Peach. Peach never give me nothing.

43:52.400 --> 43:53.400
I need a break.

43:53.400 --> 43:55.400
So is that why she ran off with Bowser again?

43:55.400 --> 43:56.400
Yeah.

43:56.400 --> 43:59.400
Don't you go screwing this thing over. Bowser will take her heart.

43:59.400 --> 44:01.400
She not take Bowser.

44:01.400 --> 44:03.400
So how's that not my fault?

44:03.400 --> 44:05.400
That's not your fault. You get out of here.

44:05.400 --> 44:06.400
You get out of here.

44:06.400 --> 44:07.400
Aww.

44:10.400 --> 44:13.400
Rama, you know I love you. You're the biggest goddamn nerd.

44:13.400 --> 44:15.400
Yes. Yes, I know.

44:15.400 --> 44:16.400
Alright.

44:16.400 --> 44:17.400
You too.

44:17.400 --> 44:18.400
What's this next one?

44:18.400 --> 44:25.400
This one was Taiki's idea of talking to Mario about the financial crisis in the Mushroom Kingdom.

44:25.400 --> 44:31.400
I mean, just to give a quick recap. New Super Mario 2.

44:31.400 --> 44:34.400
You have to collect the million coins to get the special statue.

44:34.400 --> 44:38.400
My first thought is there's clearly a financial crisis in the Mushroom Kingdom.

44:38.400 --> 44:43.400
Alright. Let's hear about that. Is the Mushroom Kingdom about to go off a fiscal cliff?

44:43.400 --> 44:44.400
Uh, who knows?

44:44.400 --> 44:46.400
Alright. Let's hear it.

44:46.400 --> 44:49.400
What would the funny physics in the Mario...

44:49.400 --> 44:52.400
Oh, sorry. I was playing the interview over you. Go ahead.

44:52.400 --> 44:56.400
With the funny physics in the Mushroom Kingdom. I don't know if that's possible.

44:56.400 --> 44:59.400
Alright. Let's hear the clip.

44:59.400 --> 45:02.400
This is Taiki with a voice of Greeks.

45:02.400 --> 45:06.400
And this is for special report. The financial crisis in the Mushroom Kingdom.

45:06.400 --> 45:11.400
I have Mario here. Mario, I've been told you've been tasked to collect a million coins.

45:11.400 --> 45:15.400
What are your thoughts on the current financial status in the Mushroom Kingdom?

45:15.400 --> 45:18.400
Oh, it's very tough at times. Very tough at times indeed.

45:18.400 --> 45:23.400
My new game, New Super Mario Bros. 2, is not about me fighting Bowser to fight the Princess Peach.

45:23.400 --> 45:28.400
No. It's about me getting enough money so that Princess Peach can keep the castle.

45:28.400 --> 45:31.400
Otherwise, no more castle. And for me, no more heroing.

45:31.400 --> 45:33.400
No more heroing. No more games.

45:33.400 --> 45:35.400
I need to get the coins.

45:35.400 --> 45:39.400
Oh, it's a bigger problem. Aye, aye, aye, aye.

45:39.400 --> 45:43.400
So the rumors that they are foreclosing on the castle at the Mushroom Kingdom is true.

45:43.400 --> 45:47.400
What rumors? I don't hear nothing. I just have a peach.

45:47.400 --> 45:49.400
Sir, you're avoiding the question.

45:49.400 --> 45:53.400
What question? You look a lot like a Koopa.

45:53.400 --> 45:55.400
What? I should stop you?

45:55.400 --> 45:58.400
No. I'm just asking questions, sir. Just asking questions.

45:58.400 --> 46:05.400
So what are your thoughts on the overabundance of S.T.A.R.S. and how that's affected the stock market?

46:05.400 --> 46:09.400
Overabundance of S.T.A.R.S. makes Mario invincible.

46:09.400 --> 46:14.400
Invincible Mario kick ass? What problem?

46:14.400 --> 46:18.400
There's a massive price crash on S.T.A.R.S.

46:18.400 --> 46:21.400
Oh, I see, I see.

46:21.400 --> 46:23.400
Mario doesn't understand economics, does he?

46:23.400 --> 46:28.400
Not very much, no. I stomp on the goombas, I kick at the Koopas.

46:28.400 --> 46:33.400
I beat at the buzzer, I collect the coins, and I get nothing from a peach.

46:33.400 --> 46:35.400
Not even cake?

46:35.400 --> 46:38.400
Not even cake. Oh, woe isn't me.

46:38.400 --> 46:43.400
And that was Taiki, voice of the geek network, signing off.

46:43.400 --> 46:48.400
Who was that guy actually? Just like a die hard fan or what?

46:48.400 --> 46:50.400
Pretty much.

46:50.400 --> 46:53.400
Okay. A crazy person.

46:53.400 --> 46:55.400
Crazy hobo.

46:55.400 --> 46:57.400
Hobo with a shotgun?

46:57.400 --> 46:59.400
I liked it.

46:59.400 --> 47:03.400
Just saw him in the line getting interviewed by someone at Nintendo.

47:03.400 --> 47:10.400
Okay. So did you guys get on some of the news stations dressed up or what happened?

47:10.400 --> 47:16.400
Me, not really, because the only people I saw there was people from Nintendo, that was just about it.

47:16.400 --> 47:21.400
But there was photographers and someone from Weekly Famitsu took my picture.

47:21.400 --> 47:23.400
Oh, hey. Nice.

47:23.400 --> 47:25.400
And Mashable was there as well.

47:25.400 --> 47:28.400
Yeah, I was also speaking with some of the other press people there.

47:28.400 --> 47:34.400
Yomiuri Shimbun was also there, a couple other press outlets were there too.

47:34.400 --> 47:37.400
That's true. We do have to remember that we actually got the system before Japan.

47:37.400 --> 47:41.400
This is one of those kind of, you know, it doesn't happen all the time, but kind of different.

47:41.400 --> 47:44.400
Didn't it happen with the last Wii and the 3DS?

47:44.400 --> 47:48.400
I guess it tends to happen more with Nintendo than does the other companies.

47:48.400 --> 47:52.400
Because it seems like PlayStation and Vita and all that were out way earlier.

47:52.400 --> 47:54.400
I know the Xbox is always coming out earlier over in Japan.

47:54.400 --> 47:57.400
Well, Xbox makes a stud in Japan. All right.

47:57.400 --> 47:59.400
Just they don't sell one for a few months.

47:59.400 --> 48:04.400
Oh, whatever. All right. These last two interviews are some big ones.

48:04.400 --> 48:07.400
So set this one up for us, Rama. What's next for us?

48:07.400 --> 48:14.400
Well, at the front of the line was Triforce, who says he was there on the line for about a month.

48:14.400 --> 48:20.400
And he has some bit of surprising news to let the fans know about him doing console launches.

48:20.400 --> 48:22.400
Ooh, okay. Let's hear it.

48:22.400 --> 48:29.400
Hey, DJ Varmus here in front of Nintendo World USA, where in just mere hours,

48:29.400 --> 48:33.400
the new Wii U is going to hit the store shelves and take names and kick a lot of butt.

48:34.400 --> 48:37.400
Now, as you can see behind me, there are die-hard fans out here.

48:37.400 --> 48:39.400
How die-hard are you guys?

48:42.400 --> 48:43.400
How long have you all been out here?

48:45.400 --> 48:50.400
As you can see, but through the maze and through the vines, we're here with the one, the only, Triforce.

48:50.400 --> 48:52.400
Good to meet you, sir.

48:52.400 --> 48:53.400
What's going on, guys?

48:53.400 --> 48:57.400
Not much. We do what we got to do. So tell me, how long have you been waiting out here?

48:57.400 --> 49:00.400
Almost a month, since March 23.

49:01.400 --> 49:04.400
I'm getting serious. Since March 23.

49:06.400 --> 49:09.400
I'm still thinking about the 3DS since October 23.

49:11.400 --> 49:13.400
October 23. Now, that's hard. That's dedication.

49:15.400 --> 49:17.400
I tip my hat to you, good sir.

49:18.400 --> 49:23.400
So, I do recall that you were somewhere else for the Wii, is that correct?

49:23.400 --> 49:27.400
Yes, it was Toys R Us, and that was back in November. I can remember that date.

49:27.400 --> 49:31.400
Oh yeah, we all remember that. So, why here instead of there?

49:31.400 --> 49:39.400
First of all, this is my last launch that I'm going to be doing, and I took a guess.

49:39.400 --> 49:43.400
I did some investigating, and I just felt that they were going to do the launch here.

49:43.400 --> 49:48.400
See, that's where it is, because you know what? We talked to people about the Wii, and I kept telling everyone,

49:48.400 --> 49:51.400
Nintendo World is the jump-off spot, because this is where the party is at.

49:51.400 --> 49:54.400
So, how many of these launch events have you done?

49:54.400 --> 49:56.400
This is my 8th and final one.

49:56.400 --> 49:58.400
Why is it your final one, good sir?

49:58.400 --> 50:05.400
I want to go and try to do some type of other marketing in the gaming community from the urban market,

50:05.400 --> 50:10.400
you know, from the grassroots side, and although I do a lot of this,

50:10.400 --> 50:13.400
I want to leave this for somebody else to do while I can help out elsewhere.

50:13.400 --> 50:20.400
You know, I've done enough of it, and I'm 35 years old, so now's the time to stop.

50:20.400 --> 50:26.400
That's not to say that I won't be at other launch parties, but the whole camping for the first, I'm going to stop it. This is it.

50:26.400 --> 50:33.400
So, in other words, after this, someone else is going to inherit the Power Glove, like you now have the power.

50:33.400 --> 50:34.400
Oh, they're going to fight you for it?

50:34.400 --> 50:39.400
No, they're not getting that. They're just going to have to line up. That's it. I'm keeping the Power Glove.

50:39.400 --> 50:43.400
Between you and me, I stomp somebody out for that to keep my Power Glove?

50:43.400 --> 50:45.400
Well, that may happen, yeah.

50:45.400 --> 50:47.400
So, what was your first launch?

50:47.400 --> 50:49.400
The Nintendo DS.

50:49.400 --> 50:52.400
And how was that compared to the launch for the Wii U?

50:52.400 --> 51:00.400
Well, each year, Nintendo gets better with the launch. That was all the way back in 2004, and that was the first launch that I got first in.

51:00.400 --> 51:08.400
My first ever launch was the Nintendo 64. I was the first in line, but that's what made me get into the whole launch thing.

51:08.400 --> 51:14.400
Then after that, some unmentionables. I won't mention the name of the other competitors.

51:14.400 --> 51:16.400
Oh, those guys.

51:16.400 --> 51:21.400
Those guys, yeah. That's because I was working for GameStop, so I had to work the launch party.

51:21.400 --> 51:23.400
So, it wasn't as fun?

51:23.400 --> 51:29.400
No, I wouldn't say it wasn't as fun. I wasn't in the line for the launch. I just worked the launch party.

51:29.400 --> 51:34.400
And then, the first launch party I became first for was the Nintendo DS.

51:34.400 --> 51:40.400
That's wonderful. I can't believe you're doing this for so long. Eight launches, it all ends here.

51:40.400 --> 51:45.400
So, if you're not here right now watching History in the Making, I don't know what to tell you. Peace out.

51:46.400 --> 51:51.400
Leave me alone. I was asleep. No, that's crazy. That's his last launch.

51:51.400 --> 51:57.400
It's interesting that he's kind of chalking it up to being 35 and all that, which is interesting because I'm kind of like,

51:57.400 --> 52:01.400
well, I'm pretty much 35 and we're not ending OLR anytime soon.

52:01.400 --> 52:07.400
But, I can also understand the whole like, okay, I don't need to be first anymore.

52:07.400 --> 52:12.400
I don't have to be that guy anymore. I can let it go. I get that.

52:12.400 --> 52:19.400
And he wants to kind of pursue the other stuff. That's certainly reasonable. So, you know, props to him for being so damn dedicated.

52:19.400 --> 52:24.400
Yeah, it's like that line from Lethal Weapon, I'm getting too old for this shit.

52:24.400 --> 52:36.400
Alright, we got one more interview from the event and dare I say, it's an Orange Lounge Radio VOG Network exclusive we're about to get.

52:36.400 --> 52:37.400
Yes, we can.

52:37.400 --> 52:42.400
Alright, and I've been teasing a little bit on Twitter that you had a pretty big interview.

52:42.400 --> 52:48.400
But, it's short, but we wanted this to be special for the fans that actually bothered to tune in and listen tonight.

52:48.400 --> 52:51.400
Rama, please set up this last interview.

52:51.400 --> 52:59.400
Well, the man shows up and we all know who the man is, Reggie.

52:59.400 --> 53:04.400
He's going through the crowd, doing autographs and saying hi to everyone.

53:04.400 --> 53:10.400
And we catch him right before he goes inside Nintendo World and me and Taiki ask him a few couple of quick questions.

53:10.400 --> 53:17.400
Okay, you're gonna have to set up the clip a little longer than that. The live listeners literally just got dropped.

53:17.400 --> 53:27.400
Word must have gone up, but see, Rama, you're always the first to complain about the live stream going down and yet here we are still talking to each other. Isn't that funny?

53:27.400 --> 53:29.400
I know.

53:29.400 --> 53:36.400
Alright, with the apologies to the podcast listeners who are hearing this for the second time, Rama, go ahead and set it up one more time.

53:36.400 --> 53:46.400
No problem. Well, the man of the hour, Reggie Fils-Aime, shows up and talks to the crowd in front of Nintendo World.

53:46.400 --> 53:56.400
He's going through the crowd saying hi, doing autographs, and me and Taiki catch him right before he goes into Nintendo World and we shoot him about two or three questions.

53:57.400 --> 54:05.400
Okay, this is gonna be really awkward, but the stream just went down again. We were up for like two seconds and then it went down.

54:05.400 --> 54:15.400
I need you guys to kill all excess internet activity. I'm just saying, I need everybody across the board. Any chat, I need it all closed because this is killing the show with all these computers running.

54:15.400 --> 54:17.400
So, alright.

54:17.400 --> 54:19.400
Even my torrents of shiza porn?

54:19.400 --> 54:24.400
Yeah, any torrents of that stuff, any dropbox that might be hiding in the background or whatever, it's gotta all go down.

54:24.400 --> 54:37.400
So, okay. We are connected, here we go. Sorry, podcast listeners, I feel like Seacrest on American Idol, where it's like I'm drawing it out for like two minutes, the big interview, but please know it's for the live listeners' benefit.

54:37.400 --> 54:42.400
Okay, I am showing and it's streaming again, so here we go. The big interview with Reggie.

54:45.400 --> 54:46.400
That's good.

54:46.400 --> 54:47.400
Absolutely.

54:47.400 --> 54:49.400
Eric, how excited are you? How excited?

54:49.400 --> 54:50.400
I'm very excited.

54:50.400 --> 54:52.400
This is it, right?

54:52.400 --> 54:53.400
This is it.

54:53.400 --> 54:56.400
A new generation of gaming begins tonight.

55:00.400 --> 55:01.400
What's your name?

55:03.400 --> 55:05.400
Is that a British accent?

55:05.400 --> 55:06.400
Yeah.

55:06.400 --> 55:08.400
Came all the way from the UK just to be here?

55:08.400 --> 55:09.400
No, actually.

55:09.400 --> 55:13.400
No, come on, you could have played me. You said yes, came all the way here.

55:20.400 --> 55:22.400
Reggie, small question.

55:22.400 --> 55:28.400
A million coins in Newsroom Mario 2. Do you have any comments about the current economic crisis in Mushroom Kingdom?

55:28.400 --> 55:38.400
You know, Mario's just trying to do his part. He's collecting coins. He'll go back and spend them someday, but he's trying to help out. There will be no fiscal cliff in the Mushroom Kingdom.

55:38.400 --> 55:39.400
Thank you very much.

55:39.400 --> 55:40.400
Thank you.

55:42.400 --> 55:43.400
Did you get it?

55:43.400 --> 55:47.400
All right, so you have the chance to ask Reggie one thing.

55:51.400 --> 55:57.400
And you chose to ask him how he feels about the fiscal cliff in the Mushroom Kingdom.

55:58.400 --> 56:05.400
But you gotta admit that he actually picked up on it and rolled with it. You got to give the man credit for that.

56:06.400 --> 56:13.400
Orange Lounge Radio exclusive, everybody. Reggie comments on the fiscal cliff in the Mushroom Kingdom.

56:14.400 --> 56:21.400
I mean, that's pretty cool and all. It's almost as good as me asking, you know, what Jason Enos about in the group.

56:21.400 --> 56:29.400
But I'm sure asking them about the financial crisis in a fictional video game is fucking awesome. That's great use of time.

56:30.400 --> 56:34.400
Well, I mean, he's going to get into the media and he's going to answer all these questions about whatever.

56:34.400 --> 56:35.400
There needs to be a bumper.

56:36.400 --> 56:42.400
To be fair, it will be a bumper, but to be fair, Loki, you know damn well it doesn't matter what they ask.

56:42.400 --> 56:49.400
They would have got the same canned answer for anything. So for them to throw him a curveball, I say you guys are the biggest fucking nerds.

56:49.400 --> 56:51.400
And I so appreciate that about you.

56:52.400 --> 56:53.400
Thank you.

56:55.400 --> 57:02.400
I think that was brilliant. I would rather have had that than the canned response, because if we want the canned response, we can look at press releases.

57:02.400 --> 57:05.400
Yes, you press them for word. Yeah, whatever.

57:06.400 --> 57:09.400
And the whole five seconds before he goes, I got to go inside. Bye.

57:10.400 --> 57:11.400
Yeah, Loki's jealous he wasn't there. All right.

57:12.400 --> 57:17.400
And we're not 20 20. So it's a little bit differently. And also, you could think Taiki. That was his idea. All right.

57:18.400 --> 57:19.400
That went over damned well.

57:20.400 --> 57:25.400
Well, you both contributed a lot to that segment, and I really appreciate you guys sharing that with OLR first.

57:26.400 --> 57:31.400
I know you could have held on to that for AJS, but I really appreciate that VOG podcast sticking together.

57:32.400 --> 57:33.400
It's awesome.

57:33.400 --> 57:34.400
Hey, that's what we're here for.

57:35.400 --> 57:38.400
Plus the band has one of the official VOG sheets.

57:39.400 --> 57:44.400
Nice. Very nice. Well, we're an hour into the show. We haven't even got to our gaming weeks yet.

57:45.400 --> 57:48.400
So I'm probably going to wrap this up so we can move on. But you have anything else you guys want to get out?

57:49.400 --> 57:52.400
Taiki, great job. Anything you want to get out here before we let you go?

57:53.400 --> 57:56.400
Can I talk about the issue of Quebec independence?

57:57.400 --> 57:58.400
If you want.

57:58.400 --> 57:59.400
Independence for Quebec now.

58:00.400 --> 58:01.400
Viva Quebec!

58:02.400 --> 58:03.400
Rama, anything you want to get out?

58:04.400 --> 58:10.400
I think I should save it for calling back later. It has something to do with we use and shame stop.

58:11.400 --> 58:15.400
Oh boy. All right. Well, hopefully talk to you later. Hopefully we don't run too long tonight. I can take a lot of calls. All right.

58:16.400 --> 58:16.400


58:17.400 --> 58:18.400
Take care, buddy. And thanks, guys.

58:19.400 --> 58:19.400


58:20.400 --> 58:25.400
You can hear Anime Jam Session Tuesdays at vognetwork.com, 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern.

58:26.400 --> 58:34.400
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, bronze.

58:35.400 --> 58:41.400
Big thanks to them for being out there, even though their questions were a little bit lullsy. You know what? I'll take it.

58:42.400 --> 58:49.400
All right. Moving on. Let's get to our video game weeks. And how was our gaming week? It's only an hour into the show.

58:50.400 --> 58:55.400
Loki! How you doing? Oh, wait. I always start with Jamie. How you doing? How was your gaming week?

58:56.400 --> 58:57.400
I already know what she's going to say.

58:58.400 --> 58:59.400
It was sweet.

59:00.400 --> 59:01.400
Yeah. What's that?

59:02.400 --> 59:09.400
I played and beat Sugar Rush on the Wreck-It Ralph website. It's fucking fun. It needs to be like a for reals game.

59:10.400 --> 59:16.400
I mean, and I was actually really surprised by how long it was because, I mean, I was playing for a few solid hours.

59:16.400 --> 59:23.400
It's like you have four stages with three races in each stage. And like the first two, I think, are two laps.

59:24.400 --> 59:29.400
And then the third one is three laps. And then the last one's three laps. And it's much, much longer and complex.

59:30.400 --> 59:37.400
And I mean, it's like a stupid little kart racer, but it was really fun. And I've decided that Rancis is the best name ever.

59:38.400 --> 59:43.400
And my first born, if I have one, will be Rancis. Rancis Flubber Buffer, whatever his name is.

59:43.400 --> 59:53.400
The one with the Reese's cup on his head. And then I played a bunch of Mass Effect 2. I played a bunch of it today.

59:54.400 --> 01:00:04.400
And then I actually did a whole bunch of design work, but my design work had me going and pulling samples off of old video game packaging because I wanted certain colors.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:12.400
Like I pulled the gold off the Nintendo cartridge, off of the Zelda cartridge, because I wanted that particular shade.

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:20.400
Because it's like when you sample part of it, it comes out kind of this muted brown. And that was the color I wanted.

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:28.400
And I was like, what do I know that reflects that color? So I was sampling NES cartridges to get the right shade of brown off of a gold Zelda cartridge.

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:29.400
Very cool.

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:37.400
And I actually logged into WoW just because I don't want to get kicked out of the guild. I hate to say that.

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:49.400
But I mean, I'm trying to build myself back up into actually wanting to level my troll. It's just, no one plays on Blade's Edge anymore and that's the only character I really care about is my main on there.

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:56.400
Ragenator at live.vognetwork.com expressing surprise. DarkSakura won't name her first born, Garrus. WTF.

01:00:56.400 --> 01:01:02.400
No. Rancis. No. Actually, I'm probably never going to have a kid, so it doesn't matter.

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:08.400
No, I'm serious. At this point, I'm perfectly content with it. All you people who have kids, good luck.

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:12.400
You know what, you will have a new kitty to name someday. It's a very similar dilemma.

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:21.400
I need a cat in my life right now. But Dan's like, we have to buy a house first. So I'm like, well fine, if I can buy a house so I can get a cat.

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:25.400
For the cat, because the cat needs the house. It won't be your house, it'll be the cat's house.

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:30.400
I decided that when I get a cat, it's going to be named Mochi. I don't care, my cat will be named Mochi.

01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.400
That's a good name. Alright, anything else for your gaming week?

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.400
Um, um, cooking with dog.

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:44.400
Okay, no, because I've been going in between playing Mass Effect 2, pausing my game, making Udon because I'm also watching cooking with dog.

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:51.400
And then going back and playing more Mass Effect, that's been my cycle. Mass Effect, cooking with dog, cooking. Mass Effect, cooking with dog, cooking.

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:54.400
Loki, how was your gaming week?

01:01:54.400 --> 01:02:05.400
I played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, Call of Duty Black Ops 2 because I'm really getting into the single player campaign, tried some more of the multiplayer, just kind of some system link stuff at work.

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:10.400
The rest, we should be getting copies for everybody this week so we can play some of that.

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:17.400
And so far, I've loved every minute of it and it hasn't let me down at all, so I'm looking forward to that.

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:22.400
And I think I fit in a little bit of Minecraft this week as well.

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:26.400
That's pretty much it.

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:30.400
Jason, how about you? It's been a while since we've seen you last. What's been going on in your gaming world?

01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:39.400
Well, for that time frame, no, not that whole time frame. I've actually been out here for work for a week at this point, just over a week.

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:46.400
So the literal week has been rather light because I've been having exciting San Francisco, California fun times.

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:55.400
But there is a setup at the office and the office favorite is FIFA 13, so I've been thoroughly trashed at that game, both by the computer and by my co-workers.

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.400
Is that the one that they're hazing for being just like FIFA 12?

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:00.400
Isn't that all sports games in this generation?

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:02.400
That's on the Wii.

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:05.400
I mean, like, for real, it is a carbon copy. Like, I'm not, like, no jet.

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:07.400
And Pro Evo are both carbon copies.

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:15.400
The last time I was out here, they did have FIFA 12 in the game. The only notable difference I've noticed is that they give you more interactivity during the loading screen.

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:21.400
But I completely admit that's completely superficial because I start a multiplayer game and go with it.

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:27.400
And I can't really comment to single player, you know, GM, those kind of bonus modes, anything like that. I couldn't say at all.

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:38.400
They did also get Halo 4 and I started a campaign by myself on, I think the tier is easy, normal, legendary, heroic, and I'm on legendary because I thought I could keep up.

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:40.400
No.

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:42.400
Oh, Dan made that mistake.

01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:49.400
No, it might be passable with help, you know, a multiplayer legendary campaign, but me by myself, I'm still in Chapter 1.

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:58.400
And I gave up after playing the same checkpoint, just passed the same checkpoint about 30, 40 times, maybe more, I'm not entirely sure.

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:01.400
I suck at Halo and I'm very, very sad at this fact.

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:11.400
Otherwise, yeah, that's really it. I'm still nursing Borderlands 2 since I've been traveling quite a bit over these past two months.

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:16.400
And not really sit down and play meaningful games time lately, unfortunately.

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:18.400
Alrighty.

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:25.400
Most of my week, I already talked about with the Wii U launch, so in the interest of time, I'm not going to repeat myself, but I will talk about just quickly.

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:32.400
Played a little bit of Mass Effect 3 because we tried to set it up so that we have two TVs and two Xbox 360s here at the house.

01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:37.400
So Alan and I were like, can we play multiplayer with each other, even though we only have one copy of the game?

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:41.400
And we figured out, yes, we can, because all of multiplayer is on both discs.

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:43.400
So we put one disc in one and one in the other.

01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:55.400
And how we got around the online pass is I had Alan play on my usual Xbox and I played on the other one because when you have licensed content on the 360, it's licensed to the original console and your ID.

01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:04.400
So we made it work and we played and Alan decided he hated it because having to go from keyboard and mouse to controller, apparently not a good fit.

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:14.400
I also played some Halo 4, finished the first five episodes of Spartan Ops playing with a friend. I think we actually did six.

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:17.400
So that was cool. Halo, good times.

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:19.400
Emphasis on with a friend.

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:25.400
Yes, and I think Spartan Ops we did normal. We're not too crazy now.

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:34.400
All right. Some housekeeping for you guys. Please remember, you can follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch radio, as well as Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R.

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:37.400
Meanwhile, let's get into some news.

01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:41.400
And a quick thank you to everybody voting in the podcast awards, which are now closed.

01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:48.400
Thank you very much. Absolutely. Yes. Thank you to everybody who voted for us in the podcast awards. And if you didn't, I hope you kept it indie.

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:50.400
I forgot one more game.

01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:52.400
Oh, hurry. Very solid here.

01:05:52.400 --> 01:06:00.400
Oh, I played that too, thanks to that tip last week. It's cute. Yeah, it's free. I can't complain. Better than Yaris.

01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:03.400
All right. Let's get into some news, Loki.

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:08.400
Rob, having your head drilled open with your brains falling out is better than Yaris.

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:13.400
All right. So there was a, there was a system that launched today, the Wii U.

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:15.400
Really? I hadn't heard.

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:21.400
I can see how you can be confused. It is very similar to the previous generation.

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:27.400
You may, you may have been confused and bought another Wii, so you better double check that.

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:29.400
So this one's black.

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:31.400
They do make black Wiis now.

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:43.400
So, let's see. You know, you know the difference between the Wii U and the Wiis. The Wii has functioning online right now. That's pretty sad.

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:52.400
All right. So the Wii they claim is going to be in larger supply, probably due to less demand, but it is going to be easily more available.

01:06:53.400 --> 01:07:04.400
They're not going to make their artificial shortage as big this time around, but he says basically their second and, you know, third, fourth replenishments are going to be more frequent holiday time.

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:11.400
And, you know, you'll be able to get a Wii system or Wii U system before, you know, next year or next holiday, I guess.

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:14.400
Which is good, I suppose.

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:23.400
Unfortunately, like with most Nintendo console launches of recent, it is missing a few things.

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:34.400
And the first being Nintendo's highly, you know, advertised and pimped out TV service, which was supposed to be launching with the console.

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:37.400
But, you know, it's not done, so it's going to be launching in December.

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:44.400
And until then, you're at the way to watch, you know, live TV through this or, you know, your on-demand stuff, Netflix, etc.

01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:49.400
So it'll be coming in the next few weeks unless they delay it again because, you know, something they do.

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:57.400
And then also, of course, you know, fun. Yeah, I'm kidding. It's a fun console. It's an easy joke to make.

01:07:58.400 --> 01:07:59.400
Yeah, it's a fun console.

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:10.400
And I'm sure that everybody was really happy, you know, that waited in line to get their Wii U system to get home and download your 5GB firmware update, which is fantastic.

01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:16.400
And, of course, this would also encompass, you know, the Miiverse stuff as well.

01:08:17.400 --> 01:08:26.400
It's funny, though, because apparently there's some people that were having issues with it downloading so slow that they thought their console was not working, so they shut it off.

01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:29.400
Not a good idea. And now their console doesn't work.

01:08:30.400 --> 01:08:41.400
But, yes, 5GB. So if you're thinking about it, if you've got that non-black system, you have less than half of that storage space left for stuff.

01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:52.400
Obviously, you're not going to put an actual game on there because there's no room for it, but you're not going to be able to fit, you know, you're going to basically need to get an external storage device, which is kind of...

01:08:52.400 --> 01:09:00.400
You kind of would have had to anyways, but still. It's not as bad. Remember when the Xbox 360 came out and everyone's like,

01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:08.400
Oh, hey, the 20GB hard drive. What? 7GB of this is just, you know, the backwards compatibility data.

01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:15.400
This is almost as bad, except I didn't have to wait an hour for the backwards compatibility data to exist on that hard drive.

01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:23.400
And, of course, you know, with any network launch, this would be for MMOs and stuff, they've been having a little bit of issues.

01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:33.400
It's been kind of up and down, probably because of the high traffic, but thankfully it is back up. Fantastic.

01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:43.400
It worked fine for me, for what it's worth. To be fair, it did take an hour, but I expect that 5GB is going to take an hour to download, but it did work fine, and I haven't really had connectivity problems.

01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:53.400
Well, Wii video chat was a little bumpy. We got some weird error messages that weren't even true, because we were able to connect fine. It was weird.

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:58.400
Warning, the person on the other end does not exist. Not quite that, but yeah.

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:07.400
Oh. So, there's your Wii U launch. Get excited! I'm thrilled.

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:17.400
Alright. Well, not too thrilled is this guy. He got caught by the police. Justin Success Brooks. Yes, his name was Success Brooks.

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:28.400
Well, unfortunately, he wasn't very successful in his business of selling counterfeit Nintendo games in the UK, because he got caught and sentenced to 32 months of jail time.

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:36.400
He was actually selling counterfeited games. He was working with some dealers in China through 18 different websites.

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:47.400
Nintendo had warned. The UK border agency had warned. He had his stock seized at one point. However, he continued to sell the games through a different website, so it was kind of one of those.

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:58.400
They weren't going to keep him out any other way, so they officially sentenced him to 32 months, although even in the UK, you don't really end up serving the entire time. He'll probably only be serving about half of it.

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:12.400
What's interesting, Francesca Levitt, who is one of the prosecutors on this case, claiming the victim is not really Nintendo, but legitimate online game retailers who have to compete with counterfeit sellers.

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:21.400
Quote, Nintendo may be big enough to weather the storm, but the damage this has done to the reputation of online retailers is untold and incalculable. That's in a statement to The Guardian.

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:44.400
I would take that down one more notch, that not so much Evil G and those others, but people who do use game stores or import game stores or the people who really try to carve out their niche, that oh yeah, they also sell big retail titles, mainstream titles, because you don't survive as a business any other way.

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:55.400
I think it is a good reminder that this kind of stuff doesn't just hurt Nintendo, it hurts everybody in the chain, from developers and makers to the people that sell them.

01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:57.400
It hurts my feelings.

01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:58.400
And Jamie's feelings.

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.400
And it gives Reggie hemorrhoids.

01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:01.400
What?

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:03.400
Because he's all butthurt.

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:07.400
Oh, I see. Alright, let's move on with another story, Darzaka.

01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:11.400
Okay, well, who likes Pokemans?

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:13.400
Who doesn't like Pokemans?

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:17.400
Of course, Loki raised his hand.

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:29.400
Well, actually Nintendo is doing Poke Deck IOS, which is their first paid app in the Apple Store. Of course, it's only out in Japan right now.

01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:41.400
And it covers everything up through black and white, and it's 170 yen, which is about £1.30, so I guess here it would be maybe a $3 download.

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:52.400
There's also extra packs with other monsters that go up to 500 yen, so yeah, you could pay a lot of money for it.

01:12:52.400 --> 01:13:03.400
But now there's still a free app that's the Pokemon Say Tap that was out for a little bit last year, but for right now this is their first paid app.

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:23.400
I have to say that, and some of it may be the language, and I know that interfaces do vary highly in between languages, but this Pokedex IOS looks kind of as crap as Pokedex 3D on the 3DS Store. I never liked it.

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:34.400
It may also be that I've kind of abandoned ship as far as Pokemon is concerned, and I haven't played it recently enough, so none of the creatures were familiar, but this doesn't hit me.

01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:37.400
I heard that this thing is full of in-game purchases too.

01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:43.400
Oh yeah, that's what I was saying. There's four extra packs, and they're 500 yen total.

01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:44.400
They ain't free.

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:47.400
No, I mean, you roughly end up paying about seven bucks.

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:48.400
Wow.

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:55.400
Six or seven. I'm trying to do a little bit of conversion here, but yeah, you end up paying more like about six bucks.

01:13:55.400 --> 01:14:04.400
So, Loki, you gotta be excited about this. It's Nintendo on an Apple product full of microtransactions. This is like made for you.

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:11.400
It sounds like just any other app on the IOS Apple Store or whatever.

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:17.400
I think it's just, what's interesting is it's not a knockoff for once.

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:30.400
This is true. And plus the whole, oh my gosh, it's something Nintendo on Apple, but you know, before the emails correcting us come in, we should say there's a very different relationship when it comes to the Pokemon company.

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:38.400
Because they, even though Nintendo somewhat controls them at the end of the day, if the Pokemon company wants to do something different, they can.

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:45.400
And so for them to be the ones dipping their big toe in with this IOS app is not, it's not too surprising.

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:52.400
And it could be interesting because if this does very well, which, who knows, maybe that will cause Nintendo? I don't know.

01:14:52.400 --> 01:15:02.400
But then again, Nintendo's always been very much, no, ever since the CDI, never again will our characters be on another console.

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:07.400
Alright, moving on.

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:16.400
Alright, so let's talk a little bit about non-Nintendo stuff. Let's talk about Microsoft.

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:21.400
And of course they were celebrating the 10 year anniversary of Xbox Live.

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:33.400
And with that they were giving out some fancy Xbox Live 10 year anniversary themed Xbox 360s to people that had been on live for those 10 years.

01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:38.400
Of course certain people didn't get them. Like Bobby.

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:41.400
Sorry Bobby.

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:44.400
But there's some, you know, some random users were getting them.

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:52.400
I don't think every 10 year user got one. You probably got entered into a drawing or something behind the scenes and they gave away like 100 of them or something.

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:56.400
Yeah, they never really explained it. It doesn't really make any sense to me that they would give you a console.

01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:02.400
I mean that's kind of cool that you get a console, but wouldn't you already have a console if you're on Xbox Live? It's like hooray!

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:08.400
All the people that won it are the people that have lived through about 5 or 6 Red Rings and E74s.

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:12.400
So the next time it invariably happens to their next one, they have a replacement already.

01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:15.400
And it looks pretty cool actually.

01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:19.400
It's neat I guess.

01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:28.400
So yeah, so some of you who may have been on there for 10 years will maybe be getting an email or something saying hey you got a 360 coming your way.

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:35.400
You probably would have already got that email or you got the email that I got that says congrats, here's your code for an avatar helmet.

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:38.400
I got an email and two messages.

01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:42.400
Take the fucking helmet, Loki. Take it.

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.400
I don't want the helmet. I'm not wearing the helmet.

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:47.400
No, take it. Here's another message. Here's another code. Take the damn helmet.

01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:49.400
It puts the helmet on its avatar.

01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:54.400
Nice.

01:16:54.400 --> 01:17:02.400
Alright, speaking of Microsoft, this is interesting because we know the PlayStation Magazine is stopping, the Nintendo Power is stopping.

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:06.400
Well, Xbox World is also going to cease publishing in December.

01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:12.400
But this is what's interesting. This is one over in the UK and the last issue is going out with a bang.

01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:21.400
Details on the next Xbox which they say is going the way of Apple and is going to be called simply Xbox.

01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:26.400
Loki is shaking his head. What?

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:27.400
This is dumb.

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:32.400
And Sony's brand new TV called TV, it's called the new TV.

01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:39.400
Thank you for not making it fucking confusing. We're just going to call it something else anyways.

01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:44.400
That's just basically saying, hey, you know what, we just didn't want to market a name that people are going to make fun of.

01:17:44.400 --> 01:17:48.400
We're just going to market a name that we already had that people can make fun of or something.

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:55.400
To be fair, it's rumor. We don't know. But anyway, 8 gigs of RAM, quad core processor, it will run Blu-ray discs.

01:17:55.400 --> 01:18:03.400
Supposedly going to have in the future like some type of future add-on would be a head-mounted augmented reality device.

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:08.400
And there will also be a next generation Kinect which I think we all see as kind of a duh.

01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:13.400
Anyhow, in a statement, Xbox World editor-in-chief Dan Dawkins said,

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:18.400
Xbox World has been at the cutting edge of Durango coverage for over 12 months.

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:26.400
Unless something really dramatic changes, everything we reveal in our penultimate issue will be revealed long before E3 in June.

01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:29.400
That was in an interview with CVG overseas.

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:34.400
So basically they just recap the original leaked rumor thing that, you know.

01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:42.400
Yeah, there really isn't a lot here new that wasn't in the rumor except the part about the name and the augmented reality we've sort of heard in different forms.

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:49.400
Because we've talked about that whole projection on the walls. I'm not hearing that here. I'm hearing it's glasses instead.

01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:51.400
It's not going to be glasses.

01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:52.400
You don't think, huh?

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:53.400
No.

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:59.400
That would, you'd get into a lot of accessibility issues with glasses. That's why the projection thing made more sense.

01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:02.400
That's why 3D TVs aren't popular because you have to buy the glasses.

01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:03.400
That's a good point.

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:08.400
And it's just, I don't know. It's just, no.

01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:17.400
WhatupG in chat says, at live.vognetwork.com says, next E3 is supposed to be the coming out party for the PS4 slash 720.

01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:19.400
You know, that's the assumption we're all making.

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:23.400
And it sounds like, at least in Microsoft's case, that'll be true.

01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:27.400
But why is this necessarily true for Sony?

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:32.400
Is there any indication that Sony is really going to debut this or is this wishful thinking on the community's part?

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:36.400
I think it's all wishful thinking. I don't think anyone's going to debut a system next year.

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:38.400
Oh, you think Microsoft's going to hold off too?

01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:44.400
I think that the Wii is not going to do as well. It's not going to take over like the Xbox 360 and the PS3.

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:48.400
So they're just like, eh, why do we have to hurry? There's really no hurry.

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:54.400
Yeah, but the 360 was out before the Wii. So it would not be uncharacteristic of Microsoft to launch.

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:57.400
Right about now is a good, you know, life cycle for them and it makes sense.

01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:02.400
Especially if they, quote unquote, beat Sony by a year. Sony's later in the... Sony's...

01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:07.400
I guess. I mean, if you look at what they have slated so far, what Microsoft has announced,

01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:12.400
they only have first quarter next year that's been announced, or even the first half of next year.

01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:17.400
And Sony's kind of similar. They've got a few things that they've announced.

01:20:17.400 --> 01:20:22.400
They've got about three or four titles. Those could all be first half of next year, but they haven't really...

01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:26.400
I mean, it's a little early to announce the second half because you want to have something for E3 now.

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:34.400
You think the last Office and the... what's that other big one? The one that keeps disappearing at various E3s?

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:35.400
The Last Guardian?

01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:40.400
Last Guardian, thank you. There's no way in hell Last Guardian's out before next holiday.

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:47.400
And then on top of that, you still have whatever happened to 13 versus, question mark. We don't know where that is.

01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:48.400
Who cares?

01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:49.400
I mean, that's third party.

01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:50.400
But who cares?

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:58.400
A lot of Final Fantasy fans care. And, like it or not, 14 reborn. That ain't happening until at least summer next year.

01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:04.400
So we know there is stuff on the calendar up to the holiday, at least in Sony's department.

01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:06.400
So, that's interesting.

01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:10.400
Well, I mean, that's not Sony necessarily. That's third party companies.

01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:14.400
And obviously you're going to have third parties putting out titles.

01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:23.400
Well, that's early part next year. But you still have stuff coming out for a while on there because not everyone is going to pick up.

01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:29.400
It's just like the Wii. The Wii is still going to have some stuff coming out. Not anything from Nintendo, but they're going to have a few things.

01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:34.400
Interesting comment from Tigerclaw in the chat room. What about the Ouya? You would also have to deal with that when it comes out.

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:42.400
Well, the Ouya is kind of its own little thing. I don't think any of the other guys are taking the Ouya seriously because the Ouya is such a grassroots homebrew thing.

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:48.400
It's like, oh, that little basement, that kid's basement toy. I honestly think that's how they view it.

01:21:48.400 --> 01:21:54.400
Because what's the Ouya going to do for the gaming experience? Is it really going to push the gaming experience further?

01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:59.400
No, it's just going to open up. It's going to be the most indie friendly thing you've ever seen.

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:05.400
It's just going to be kind of similar to how Steam, because it's kind of the way Steam is trying to go too.

01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:09.400
They have the whole Steam Greenlight stuff to try and get your indie games on their marketplace.

01:22:09.400 --> 01:22:14.400
And then Steam Big Picture. So they kind of want to sell you a box, which they may eventually do.

01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:20.400
They will eventually sell you a box that you hook up to your TV and you just get all the Steam stuff with a controller and away you go.

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:23.400
Which would be fantastic. I don't have a problem with that.

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:30.400
But I think Ouya is trying to do something similar to that where they have got the box that they sell you, which is really tiny, which is awesome.

01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:36.400
And then of course all these games are going to be kind of exclusive to it because they're mobile games for the most part.

01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:45.400
And you'll just have to see how it takes off. I don't think it's going to be huge. It's not going to all of a sudden just take over the Wii or anything like that.

01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:46.400
It's not going to happen.

01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:51.400
It'll be like a Roku. A lot of people have them, but not everybody is talking about them.

01:22:51.400 --> 01:23:01.400
Unless, and it's obviously the Wii U doesn't have anything like this, but let's just say that one day they decide,

01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:07.400
hey, you know what, we're going to make it so all these games that you buy from us, you can't trade them in anymore.

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:12.400
Or in the next consoles that come out, hey, by the way, all these games are going to be tied to your console.

01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:14.400
Then something like that may be able to take off.

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:19.400
I'm seeing on Twitter that your Nintendo network ID is tied to that console. You can't move it.

01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:27.400
Now, I'm seeing a lot of rage on Twitter about that. I kind of think that's that whole, we just haven't built how to move it yet.

01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:33.400
I'm giving Nintendo the benefit of the doubt that they just haven't freaking built that in yet.

01:23:33.400 --> 01:23:38.400
Once again, reiterating what we've been saying for months now, they don't fucking get online.

01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:42.400
They have something that resembles online right now, but they still don't fucking understand it.

01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:45.400
They're making it up as they go along.

01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:53.400
That's a real bad, I mean, come on, this is how late into the game are we getting into like an actual functioning online?

01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:59.400
And you still haven't figured, I mean, this is this is shit that they were, you know, fucking up years ago.

01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:04.400
And now they're just, it's amateur shit.

01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:08.400
All right. Dark Soccer, what do you have for us before we get to release dates?

01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:14.400
I have stuff and things. So I'm sure people were interested in Black Ops 2.

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:18.400
Although when one of my friends posted about it as B02, I was like, body odor 2?

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:23.400
Because it's really about as much as I care about Black Ops, but they did something really awesomely stupid.

01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:32.400
On the installation disk, it has the data for Mass Effect 2 on it instead.

01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:36.400
So they're getting a much better game.

01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:40.400
But that means that they can't install Black Ops 2 with the disks.

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:47.400
And they've, but the retail copies come with the Steam key and you can do a digital install and it takes longer.

01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:49.400
But you know what?

01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:57.400
Now, I heard something, and I don't know if this ended up being true or not, but I heard something about that this was being caused because these people actually...

01:24:57.400 --> 01:24:59.400
Oh, it's PC copies, by the way.

01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:09.400
Yeah, these people already had Mass Effect 2 installed on their PCs and Mass Effect 2 had the lock on some type of file extension that Call of Duty was also, or Black Ops was also trying to use.

01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:13.400
And so when Black Ops would call up the file, Mass Effect was loading.

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:17.400
Like, it seems like it's only happening to people that already had Mass Effect 2.

01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:21.400
At least that's what I'm hearing. I don't know if that panned out or whatever, but I know that was something they were exploring.

01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:24.400
Well, it says it happened specifically with the second installation disk.

01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:25.400
That's weird.

01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:35.400
Yeah. So, and it's like people on Steam, Reddit, 4chan, although no one listens to 4chan anymore, and the Black Ops forums were complaining about it.

01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:45.400
It can also be a pressing issue. They're all duplicated at a few duplicators, and if it just happens that they're pressing copies of Mass Effect 2 and some of those happen to get in there.

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:47.400
But Activision hasn't said shit about it, so...

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:52.400
Well, which is funny, yeah, because that would mean Activision and EA are using the same presser.

01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:59.400
Yeah, they do. I mean, Technicolor, they press disks for the movie industry, for everything.

01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:12.400
Yeah, there's only a few duplicators that are out there, and aside from Nintendo actually doing carts and stuff, but these all get duplicated at a few duplicators around the world, and it's just whoever they decide to use.

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:19.400
So yes, it's very possible that they get stuff that maybe another company is using.

01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:25.400
Alright, let's travel around the world and look at release dates and see what's coming to a game store near you this week.

01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:30.400
Alright, this week we've got, it's starting to slow down a little bit, so we've got a few things.

01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:43.400
Rise of the Guardians coming out on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, the Wii, the DS, the 3DS, and yeah.

01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:50.400
And then the 3DS version of Pro Evo Soccer 2013, although I think that date's wrong. I believe that's actually coming out next year, if I remember correctly.

01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:57.400
Adventure time! Hey Ice King, why'd you steal our garbage? On 3DS and DS, also collector's editions for those.

01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:09.400
Hitman Absolution on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Persona 4 Golden on the Vita, PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale on the PS3 and the Vita.

01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:19.400
Also, let's see what else we got here. That is definitely a wrong date. Man, they really need to update their goddamn website.

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:29.400
The Elder Scrolls, let's see, oh and that's not coming out. What else we got here?

01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:41.400
Alright, and let's see, we've got Scribblenauts Unlimited on PC, and the PC version came out a little bit later, and everything else.

01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:54.400
And Family Guy, Back to the Multiverse on PS3 and 360, and Kids Learn and Play Pets and Vets. I think that's a re-release.

01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:56.400
The thermometer goes in the butt.

01:27:57.400 --> 01:28:08.400
And Assassin's Creed III on PC. What the hell is this, Kids Learn and Play? It's like a bundle, but I haven't ever seen these.

01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:13.400
It's some value game. It's crap, don't buy it.

01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:22.400
That in-depth review brought to you by Loki. Alright, let's go to the Japanese release dates and what's coming out over there.

01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:32.400
On November 22nd on the Xbox 360, Doom 3, the BFG edition, as well as Call of Duty Black Ops 2, this is the version with subtitles, is released in Japan.

01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:38.400
There's also an Xbox Live special membership card to celebrate the Call of Duty release in Japan.

01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:45.400
On the PlayStation 3, Call of Duty Black Ops 2 is out there as well, same with Doom 3. There's some more stuff though as well.

01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:52.400
Some games getting price reductions, Grand Theft Auto 4, Infamous 2, Killzone 3, LittleBigPlanet 2, all of them getting price reductions.

01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:59.400
As far as new games go on the PlayStation 3, Mina No Golf 6, EX Troopers, Chaos Head,

01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:00.400
That's everybody's golf.

01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:07.400
Chaos Head Love Choo Choo, and Chaos Head Noah, as well as a double pack of both games are out there as well.

01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:16.400
And Tehayo no Arashi Senkan Yamato Akatsuki ni Shutsugiketsu comes out.

01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:21.400
You know what that is? Space Battleship Yamato? In other words, Star Blazers?

01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:26.400
Oh, luxury limited edition and regular edition in Japan this week.

01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:35.400
And a classic white slim console comes out if you need to get your Japanese PlayStation 3.

01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:38.400
Looking at the other systems real quick, let me check on the Vita.

01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:44.400
There's just another 3G Wi-Fi pack out this week that has Mina No Golf 6 with it.

01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:46.400
So, there's that, yay.

01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:50.400
On the 3DS, EX Troopers is out there as well.

01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:57.400
On the 23rd, Pokemon Fushigi no Dungeon, I'm assuming that's the Pokemon Dungeon Crawler game.

01:29:57.400 --> 01:29:59.400
Fushigi is mysterious.

01:29:59.400 --> 01:30:03.400
Oh, I keep wanting to say Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon, but it's a Pokemon game.

01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:04.400
Pokemon Mysterious Dungeon.

01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:06.400
Pikachu's Mysterious Dungeon or whatever.

01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:15.400
Ochi Manichi Tamagotchi on the 3DS, because Tamagotchi, yes, is still a thing, believe it or not.

01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:20.400
You know, I saw Furbies at Toys R Us the other day, so what's old is new again.

01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:22.400
I blocked Furby on Facebook.

01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:28.400
Now, the Wii U, keep in mind, not out over there in Japan until December the 8th,

01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:33.400
so we don't have those release dates for a little bit, but we'll work those into the rotation soon.

01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:37.400
Otherwise, we'll go to Jamie for what's coming out in the UK.

01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:39.400
Some stuff at the end. No, I'm kidding.

01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:47.400
On the 18th, Epic Mickey 2, Power of Illusion, and the Power of 2, U-Draw Studio.

01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:51.400
On the 20th, we have Hitman Absolution, Planetside, next.

01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:54.400
21st, The Walking Dead Episode 5, no time left.

01:30:54.400 --> 01:31:01.400
23rd, Assassin's Creed 3, Rise of the Guardians, Talisman Prologue.

01:31:01.400 --> 01:31:03.400
And that's it.

01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:08.400
All right, just a few more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:10.400
And I think we've got some Sony news.

01:31:10.400 --> 01:31:13.400
We've talked Nintendo, we've talked Microsoft, but Loki?

01:31:13.400 --> 01:31:18.400
Yeah, they announced already that PlayStation Plus would be coming to the Vita,

01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:21.400
and they've now announced which day it's going to be coming out.

01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:23.400
It's going to be coming out tomorrow, November 19th.

01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:27.400
And what's kind of awesome with that is they're also adding some games to the Instant Game collection

01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:29.400
that will be available for the Vita.

01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:35.400
And this includes some full Vita games, including Uncharted Golden Abyss,

01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:39.400
Jet Set Radio, which is actually set to come out next week,

01:31:39.400 --> 01:31:45.400
Wipeout 2048, Gravity Rush, Tales from Space, Mutant Blobs Attack,

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:50.400
and I guess Final Fantasy Tactics, The War of Lions, that was a PSP title.

01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:53.400
And not bad.

01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:56.400
And of course, PlayStation Plus, 18 bucks for three months,

01:31:56.400 --> 01:31:59.400
or 50 bucks for the full year.

01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:03.400
And I guess obviously if you have a PlayStation Plus membership,

01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:08.400
you also get all the free wonderful games library stuff with the PS3,

01:32:08.400 --> 01:32:12.400
and the one gigabyte of cloud storage, which is pretty awesome.

01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:14.400
And I guess a gigabyte of cloud storage on the Vita.

01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:16.400
I wonder if that's the same one gigabyte.

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:19.400
Is your Vita actually going to come out of storage now at this point?

01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:21.400
Well, it's in my backpack.

01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:23.400
Is it going to come out of your backpack?

01:32:23.400 --> 01:32:27.400
No, because I have to actually become a member of PlayStation Plus,

01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:29.400
and I just don't want to right now.

01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:32.400
I'm excited. I'm PlayStation Plus, and I couldn't be more excited about this.

01:32:32.400 --> 01:32:35.400
I'm like, oh my god, it's like Christmas on my Vita tomorrow.

01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:38.400
It's going to be great. So yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:40.400
Vita's relevance is finally starting to come out.

01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:41.400
Hooray!

01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:43.400
Just in time for the holidays.

01:32:43.400 --> 01:32:45.400
All right, well, also coming to the Vita,

01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:49.400
I think this is also tomorrow with the PlayStation Plus update,

01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:55.400
obviously a whole new firmware 2.0, a new email application for the Vita.

01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:58.400
It's kind of interesting, but well, it makes the 3G a little more lucrative,

01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:00.400
especially if you don't have a phone that does it.

01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:04.400
With the coolest PlayStation's typing interface.

01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:08.400
I get what they're doing, but no.

01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:11.400
It's easier to use than iPhone, honestly. I think so.

01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:13.400
On the Vita? Heck yeah.

01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:19.400
It's easier to have the key directly instead of having to memorize what it's under.

01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:22.400
The Vita has that tanky style mode.

01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:28.400
You can type on the keyboard, and it's really responsive and fits a large part of the screen.

01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:29.400
Oh, the Vita is a touch screen, isn't it?

01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:30.400
Hello!

01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:31.400
Okay, disregard, sorry.

01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:34.400
You're thinking about Sony's PlayStation 3 predictive text,

01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:37.400
which the Vita will do as well, so it has that.

01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:39.400
I'll be over here if you need me.

01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:48.400
That's alright. Gmail, Yahoo, and other miscellaneous providers unsaid will be supported.

01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:51.400
Also, finally, this is so dumb that they didn't have this before.

01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:55.400
Wirelessly transmit between the PC and the Vita.

01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:59.400
Also, browser and video apps will now do 1080p videos,

01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:02.400
even though it's not like it's going to magically change the output.

01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:05.400
What about wirelessly transmitting between the PS3 and the Vita?

01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:10.400
That's not said, but I would think if it's wireless between the PC, why not?

01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:12.400
Yeah, I think it would be on the PlayStation 3.

01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:15.400
I want to say I read that somewhere else, that it will do that too.

01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:16.400
Thank God.

01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:18.400
It makes so much more sense.

01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:20.400
So, very cool.

01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:23.400
That's all coming as well this week.

01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:26.400
Alright, let's go back to a time when games were a lot simpler,

01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:28.400
and you didn't have all this firmware.

01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:30.400
You got your cartridge, and you liked it.

01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:32.400
That was firmware.

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:35.400
You dropped it, and it still worked. That was firmware.

01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:40.400
You flushed a cartridge in the toilet, and it still worked.

01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:46.400
It is the classic game of the week, and I believe Dark Sakura is taking it back this week.

01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:47.400
I am.

01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:52.400
The game of the week is Yars' Revenge for the Atari 2600.

01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:55.400
Yars, not Yaris.

01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:57.400
This is a great pick, just so you know.

01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:03.400
It's also a game that particularly illustrates the proper way to use an apostrophe with something that ends in an S.

01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:09.400
Although, to be honest, if they were ever going to make a second Yars game, Yars' Revenge would be kind of funny.

01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:14.400
It would be like Christine, you know, words that end with an S.

01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:16.400
Anyway.

01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:25.400
Anyway, it came out in 1982, and it was created by Howard Scott Warshall, who wrote Raiders of the Lost Ark and E.T.

01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:27.400
But we forgive him because of Yars' Revenge.

01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:31.400
That's right. For every bad game he made, there was a good game.

01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:34.400
And let's not forget, he was under tremendous pressure with E.T.

01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:37.400
Read his side of it. You'll feel a lot of sympathy for the guy.

01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:42.400
Which isn't that like the plot of the Angry Video Game Nerds movie now?

01:35:42.400 --> 01:35:45.400
Trying to find where all the cartridges of E.T. are?

01:35:45.400 --> 01:35:47.400
Who cares? I care about the real story. No offense.

01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:52.400
Well, anyway, it was supposed to be a licensed port of the game called Star Castle.

01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:57.400
Which, there's a cannon that's protected by these counter-rotating shields.

01:35:57.400 --> 01:36:01.400
And you have to shoot holes in the shields to destroy the cannon inside.

01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:04.400
But then again, once you shoot the holes, the cannon can shoot you.

01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:06.400
So, um...

01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:08.400
Kill or be killed.

01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:10.400
Anyway.

01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:15.400
So, as they were developing the Atari version, it actually changed quite a bit.

01:36:15.400 --> 01:36:21.400
So now your hero is called a Yar, which is like a little insect thing that nibbles through the lair.

01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:27.400
And then it can shoot his cannon into the breach and kill the evil Kotyle.

01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:29.400
Which I think is how it was said.

01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:31.400
Um, who was on the side of the barrier.

01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:36.400
Although you can be shot at through the barrier.

01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:38.400
And, uh...

01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:40.400
And it, uh...

01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:42.400
And it turns into a swirl.

01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:45.400
However, you're warned before you get shot at.

01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:48.400
And you can go back to the other side of the little energy wall.

01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:53.400
Which, I swear the first time I saw that I was like, is my TV fucked up?

01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:55.400
But no. It's a party game.

01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:57.400
Um, it's also a little safe zone.

01:36:57.400 --> 01:36:59.400
The neutral zone.

01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:01.400
Um, the swirls can get you, but the little torpedoes cannot.

01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:04.400
And you cannot shoot from within the neutral zone.

01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:07.400
So, um, you've got different scoring.

01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:15.400
And if you, like, the highest thing you can get is if you shoot one of those swirls in mid-air with the Zorlon cannon.

01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:17.400
Which is this little shooty thing.

01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:22.400
You get 6,000 points and an extra life that you can get only up to nine lives.

01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:27.400
And each level ends, um, when you kill the Kotyle or the swirl.

01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:33.400
So, uh, basically when you reach 70,000 points the shield will turn blue.

01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:36.400
And the swirls come out with more frequency.

01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:39.400
If you get 150,000, the shield turns gray.

01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:42.400
And, you know, even more crap comes up.

01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:44.400
And you get a guided missile.

01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:45.400
It's gonna get ya.

01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:53.400
230,000 points, the shield turns pink, and the swirls will begin to fire three, um, times more frequently.

01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:55.400
And not give you warnings.

01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:57.400
There was a comic book that came out with it.

01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:01.400
Had a mini comic book, um, that, uh, was at the game package.

01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:10.400
And it gave the story behind the game and why it was seeking vengeance because apparently the thingy blew up their world.

01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:16.400
And then there was an album that had a theme song and a radio drama of the comic book.

01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:18.400
So that was kind of neat.

01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:27.400
There's also an easter egg in the game that if you kill a swirl in mid-air, a black vertical line appears on the screen across the spot where the swirl was shot.

01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:33.400
And the line is referred to in the manual as Ghost of Yars and warns the player to stay off the mean streak.

01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:40.400
If the player moves vertically along that line and is about one to two inches below the middle of the screen when the explosion closes,

01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:48.400
the game will end and go into a game select screen with the programmer's initials HSW, um, that's forward and backwards on the word select.

01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:54.400
Um, if you do it in game six or seven, JOV appears, which is under the player's initials.

01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:59.400
There's a remake, um, for the, uh, Game Boy Color in 1999.

01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:03.400
In 2005, of course, it came out on the Atari Flashback II.

01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:06.400
There's a three in one that came on the GBA in 2005.

01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:09.400
And, um, that also came with Pong and Asteroids.

01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:12.400
It's available in Game Room in 2010.

01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:15.400
There's a reimagining that came out on Xbox Live Arcade.

01:39:15.400 --> 01:39:22.400
Um, and, uh, actually I think it's not out yet on PS3. They said they were gonna be doing it.

01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:25.400
I don't know if it ever did come out on PS3. I don't remember.

01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:29.400
I checked it out on 360 and I was like, it is nothing like this.

01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:32.400
Well, now the Yar is a chick with power armor.

01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:42.400
And then there's another remake that's a prequel that's called Yar's Revenge First War that, um, was part of the Atari Go deal on April 8th, 2011 on Facebook.

01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:47.400
And, uh, it's supposed to be a lot more like the 2600 game. I haven't played it.

01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:53.400
And there's another one that's free on browsers that supports HTML5 that is on Atari.com.

01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:55.400
There's other classic Atari games.

01:39:55.400 --> 01:40:00.400
And, um, there's a sequel called Yar's Return that's on the Atari Flashback II.

01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:02.400
The end.

01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:06.400
There it is, your classic game of the week. A real classic going way back to the Atari 2600.

01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:11.400
Yar's Revenge. Undoubtedly one of the best 2600 games they ever did.

01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:12.400
Absolutely.

01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:15.400
Alright, well we are going to take a break, guys, when we come back.

01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:19.400
We've got more of Orange Lounge Radio to come, including rapid fire, uh, news.

01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:22.400
The Fubo Question of the Week, uh, some other gaming related news.

01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:29.400
And a hilarious follow up to something I said next week, or I said last week, would probably not go away.

01:40:29.400 --> 01:40:30.400
The Futures!

01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:33.400
It's really funny. We'll get to that in just a little bit.

01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:36.400
When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

01:40:43.400 --> 01:40:46.400
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:53.400
Live with episode number 482 of our show for this November the 18th of 2012.

01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:57.400
We're going to get into some rapid fire news, but first, I gotta ask Loki.

01:40:57.400 --> 01:41:02.400
Loki's over there. He's like, alright, let me touch the Wii U tablet.

01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:04.400
He's gonna touch the Wii.

01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:06.400
Alright, alright, Loki, touch the Wii U tablet.

01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:14.400
I, I like it. I think it has a good, for such a big frickin' thing, it's, it's got a really nice feel to it.

01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:22.400
It's, I mean, as far as the placements of the analog sticks, they're comfortable, but hitting, like, the buttons below it is not quite comfortable.

01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:34.400
It, like, if you're trying to hit the A, like, the A button, if there was a game that you were using, you know, like, first person shooters and stuff, where the A button might be used, that is a bit, you know, that could cramp up your hand pretty bad.

01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:47.400
You know what's strange about that is that from that, that's, I felt that, wow, words, yes, I felt that in the menus that, and I think this might be more related to the Xbox 360 controller since they just flipped where the buttons are.

01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:54.400
I kinda noticed that problem in the menus, but the little, the couple of games that I was playing through didn't really have finger placement issues.

01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:56.400
I don't know.

01:41:56.400 --> 01:42:08.400
Well, if you wanna follow me on Miiverse, again, I said this quickly here in the first part of the show, but if you did pick up a Wii U and you wanna follow me on Miiverse, my name on the Wii, really creative, y'all, Rob Roberts, all one word.

01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:10.400
I know, really tough to figure out.

01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:19.400
Alright, let's, uh, travel, uh, through some rapid fire news and talk quickly about what else is going on in the gaming world, not just a Wii.

01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:29.400
There's StarCraft II, Heart of the Swarm, which is the next expansion for StarCraft II, and it should be coming out March 12th.

01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:35.400
It was originally kind of alluded to or leaked out on Battle.net, and of course, they confirmed.

01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:37.400
That'll be out March 12th.

01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:48.400
It'll be released individually at $39.99, and of course, Digital Deluxe and Collector's Edition version will be available as well, priced at $59.99 and $79.99 respectively.

01:42:49.400 --> 01:43:00.400
And the Digital Deluxe version, like anything else that is Blizzard, will contain stuff that, you know, doesn't necessarily apply to the game that you're buying, which doesn't make any fucking sense to me.

01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:08.400
You get a pet for World of Warcraft and a new sigil for Diablo III, and, um, and yeah.

01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:16.400
Why, someone explain this to me, why the fuck would I buy a Collector's Edition for one game to get shit for another game? That doesn't make any goddamn sense.

01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:19.400
Because you're already playing the other game, especially WoW.

01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:29.400
There's a lot of Blizzard crossover in the fandom. I would say there's more synergy within that fandom than almost any other type of company, with the exception of maybe Squeenix.

01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:30.400
And you actually can-

01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:32.400
Before pre-IDOS.

01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:34.400
And you can get StarCraft pets in WoW.

01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:40.400
Yeah, there's a lot of that crossover, but sigils, really, really-

01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:42.400
That's a bit of a stretch.

01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:43.400
Really.

01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:45.400
But what else are they gonna give you, a friggin' legendary drop?

01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:57.400
I don't know, I mean, it's just kinda dumb that they have that. Behind the scenes DVD slash Blu-Ray, and a soundtrack, also a Heart of the Swarm hardcover art book, and a Zerg Rush mousepad.

01:43:57.400 --> 01:43:58.400
Key, key, key, key, key.

01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:10.400
Let me put it this way, okay? Rational people out there, just don't fucking buy the Collector's Edition. You don't need to spend $40 extra for a pet in WoW and a goddamn mousepad.

01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:17.400
It's not, just, resist. You can do it. I mean, seriously, it's just kinda-

01:44:17.400 --> 01:44:20.400
But if you are an addict and bought it, give me the pet.

01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:25.400
I would be glad to give you mine, because otherwise the code will be completely unredeemed.

01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:26.400
Okay.

01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:29.400
Do you have the one from the original StarCraft II release?

01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:30.400
No, I do not.

01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:32.400
Okay, I will send that your way when I get home.

01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:35.400
Yes! So I win, I win, Rob, you can't have it.

01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:38.400
Sorry, you're making food and not in the room. Disqualified.

01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:44.400
So PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale comes out next week, and they've already announced their first bit of DLC.

01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:51.400
What? Early DLC? What the fuck? Why? I'm not paying for DLC. Well, good, you don't have to, because it's actually free.

01:44:51.400 --> 01:45:05.400
And the two characters they're going to be adding to the roster include Kat, who is from Gravity Rush, the Vita game, and I guess Emmett Graves, who is the character from Starhawk.

01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:12.400
And what's kind of cool is apparently the unique gameplay styles from both of those games are going to cross over into it,

01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:26.400
including Kat's ability to manipulate gravity and Emmett's ability to kind of call the support stuff from Starhawk, the build-as-you-kind-of-go type thing.

01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:32.400
So that's pretty neat, and free DLC is always awesome, and it's kind of cool to see if they're going to be expanding this game.

01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:41.400
Maybe when the Game of the Year edition comes out with all the characters in there, they may consider picking it up, but still pretty neat.

01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:49.400
And last but not least, and I've actually used this company before, Fingerprints is actually doing something now with Minecraft,

01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:59.400
where you can actually export a part of your world and have it printed in 3D. That's right, your own Minecraft world creations in 3D.

01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:11.400
And you just have to download the app that's on the Fingerprints website, just fingerprints.com slash Minecraft, and you can go check it out.

01:46:11.400 --> 01:46:20.400
And I guess the prices vary depending on the size of your model that you're having printed, and they kind of give some examples, and they're pretty cool looking.

01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:32.400
I had gotten one from my Xbox 360 avatar, so I actually have a 3D avatar of myself at my desk, which is pretty awesome.

01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:39.400
But yeah, it doesn't really say how much it would cost for your creations.

01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:45.400
There would be some cool stuff I'd want to make from our world, but I have to see how much this is.

01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:54.400
Looks like it may only be one chunk. I'm thinking it might be one chunk, but neat! Kind of cool.

01:46:54.400 --> 01:47:06.400
Looks cool. Moving on, Classic Dragon Quest fans will rejoice in the news that the Heartbeat Studio that originally developed the games in the Super Nintendo and PS1 games,

01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:12.400
that closed shortly thereafter, is up for a revival as the Genius Sonority.

01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:18.400
They previously worked on Pokemon Colosseum, Dragon Quest Swords, and the Dinpamen, they came by wave.

01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:27.400
Manaba Yamana revealed by Twitter that Heartbeat will be relaunched after a decade, starting early next year with a new business perspective.

01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:33.400
According to Inside Games, Yamana said to expect a new webpage with more information next year.

01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:37.400
Can only imagine what their debut title is going to be.

01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:47.400
Origin has been hit by a series of security breaches as users come to find out their accounts have been cracked and personal details have been leaked.

01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:53.400
Sigh. To make matters worse, EA's own security measures ensure victims aren't resolving the issue.

01:47:53.400 --> 01:48:01.400
Because it's so unable to log back in, change your email address back, change your password, certain things along those lines.

01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:06.400
Users affected by the attack are told that their email address is invalid whenever they try to log in,

01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:13.400
and as soon as they call EA to find out what's wrong, they get shut down by representatives who can't help them without a receipt and valid date of birth.

01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:16.400
S.M.H.

01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:20.400
Yes, with a valid date of birth, the course is being changed by said hacker.

01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:28.400
Because, you know, that has to be something that'll change, because you will mysteriously be born at a different date than you once were.

01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:30.400
God bless web development.

01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:36.400
NeoGaf has managed to compile tens of thousands of threads, well that wouldn't surprise me,

01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:44.400
ten threads of complaints on EA's official forums and just a sample of the overall total of grief being expunged on the internet.

01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:52.400
If you use Origin, do your due diligence, unique password, make sure all your stuff is correct so you at least have a remote chance of getting back into your account.

01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:54.400
Be internet safe.

01:48:54.400 --> 01:49:01.400
Since you brought up NeoGaf, I don't visit that site an awful lot because it's a little too busy and I have too much, like, ADD,

01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:07.400
but there was, like, the most winning thread I've ever seen on a web forum was on NeoGaf this week,

01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:16.400
and it had to do with photoshopping your favorite, or no, a descriptive, animated gif as the box art for a game.

01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:22.400
Like, I'm describing this and I'm doing a terrible job, but like there was this great, like somebody photoshopped a box art for Tokyo Jungle,

01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:27.400
and it was like these two kiddies in a dog hall wrestling, and it was really funny, like there was all this kind of stuff.

01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:35.400
Grand Theft Auto 5 with a cop taking some guy out, it's like all these great animated gifs from around the internet on video game box art.

01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:39.400
That's absolutely nothing to do with what you just talked about, but I like gifs.

01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:41.400
Who doesn't?

01:49:41.400 --> 01:49:45.400
And two days ago was officially Miyamoto's 60th birthday.

01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:48.400
Not too much need to be said for a man like him.

01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:59.400
Imagine how the state of games would be different had Shigeru Miyamoto and Nintendo and the entire uprising that has happened on the last three decades not actually occurred.

01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:02.400
Uprising? Bad choice of words.

01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:04.400
Up checking.

01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:08.400
In some cases, like, the value Wii games, I suppose.

01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:10.400
How about Oother News?

01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:11.400
Oother News?

01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:18.400
Tom Hardy is going to be playing the lead in Splinter Cell for the movie version, Sam Fisher.

01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:19.400
Good.

01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:27.400
However, he's also slated to join Michael Fassbender in an Assassin's Creed film, so.

01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:31.400
Also, God, as if this wasn't enough.

01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:34.400
Who remembers Barkley Shut Up and Jam?

01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:43.400
Well, the group that did Barkley Shut Up and Jam Gaiden, the sequel that was all completely parody, have a new Kickstarter up to make a game called

01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:53.400
Magical Realms of Tyran Anog, Escape from Necron 7, Revenge of Cocolon, the official game of the movie chapter 2 of the Hoops Barkley saga.

01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:54.400
That's awesome.

01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:57.400
And then Jet Set Radio Vita will be out November 20th.

01:50:57.400 --> 01:51:03.400
And a mobile version will be out in 90s after for iOS and Android. The end.

01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:06.400
Let's get to the foogle question of the week.

01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:17.400
Take Facebook and Google Plus. Yes, people are on Google Plus.

01:51:17.400 --> 01:51:19.400
And slam them together and you get foogle.

01:51:19.400 --> 01:51:22.400
Make them do it. Make them have retarded babies.

01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:26.400
What? Foogle.

01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:28.400
Foogle. Go foogle yourself.

01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:35.400
Alright, every week we ask a question on our foogle communities and we get answers.

01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:38.400
And we read some of our favorite answers on the show.

01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:44.400
We have a lot of responses this week because I actually planned ahead this week and asked the question a whole day early.

01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:47.400
So you're very welcome that we get more participation this week.

01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:54.400
Very controversial article going around the internet this week because, you know, how else do you get hits for your website?

01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:55.400
Stir up some controversy.

01:51:55.400 --> 01:52:00.400
Like determining the all time 100 best video games.

01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:06.400
Now usually I wouldn't give two shits about a list like this because everybody's got one on their site, whatever.

01:52:06.400 --> 01:52:08.400
But it's Time Magazine's website.

01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:13.400
And so I go, okay, well Time Magazine, that's a magazine that's been around, you know, a little while.

01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:17.400
And has a big reputation as like a news magazine.

01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:20.400
It's in every dentist's office in the country. You've seen Time Magazine at some point.

01:52:20.400 --> 01:52:25.400
So they put up their list of the all time best of the best 100 video games.

01:52:25.400 --> 01:52:28.400
Now I don't have time to read the entire list here.

01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:32.400
But just to give you an idea of some of the things they named.

01:52:32.400 --> 01:52:35.400
The Oregon Trail was on there.

01:52:35.400 --> 01:52:38.400
Mass Effect 3 was on there.

01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:40.400
Yay!

01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:48.400
When I looked at the list, I saw it as a little more like, these are influential games.

01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:53.400
Not necessarily the best games, but games that like were felt.

01:52:53.400 --> 01:52:58.400
And there's only two games from this decade on the entire list.

01:52:58.400 --> 01:53:00.400
From the 2010s.

01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:02.400
Mass Effect 3 and Batman Arkham City.

01:53:02.400 --> 01:53:04.400
Which, well, Batman Arkham City was a pretty fucking great game too.

01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:06.400
Bad citizens are both pretty worthy.

01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:08.400
Both pretty worthy.

01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:10.400
The oldest games on the list from the 1970s.

01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:12.400
The Oregon Trail.

01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:14.400
Hunt the Wumpus.

01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:16.400
Does anyone remember that? I actually remember the Wumpus game.

01:53:16.400 --> 01:53:18.400
Pong.

01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:20.400
Breakout.

01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:22.400
Space Invaders.

01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:24.400
Adventure.

01:53:24.400 --> 01:53:26.400
And Asteroids.

01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:28.400
But some people are having issues with this list.

01:53:28.400 --> 01:53:30.400
Because they only would do one game from a series.

01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:34.400
So I think they did the original Zelda.

01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:36.400
The original Mega Man.

01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:40.400
They did Metroid, but not like any of the follow-up games.

01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:42.400
No Guardian Legend.

01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:44.400
They did Final Fantasy VII, and yes, no Guardian Legend.

01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:46.400
Bastards!

01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:48.400
They picked VII, that is amazing justification.

01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:50.400
I can see, I can see.

01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:54.400
Well look, we asked you guys on Google Plus and on Facebook.

01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:56.400
We're sure many of you saw this list.

01:53:56.400 --> 01:53:58.400
What was your impression of the list?

01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:04.400
Being that time is more of a news organization than something that typically caters to entertainment.

01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:06.400
Were there any glaring omissions or issues?

01:54:06.400 --> 01:54:10.400
So here's some of the answers from Google Plus.

01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:12.400
Kevin R. replied and said,

01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:16.400
I think Wii Sports should not be on this list.

01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:20.400
What about cult followings like Disgaea and .hack and Persona?

01:54:20.400 --> 01:54:24.400
Let's see some that are not for the mainstream.

01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:28.400
Kevin, I'm totally with you on the second half, but Wii Sports not being on the list?

01:54:28.400 --> 01:54:30.400
Well here's the thing.

01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:34.400
The fact that it's Time magazine is why Wii Sports is on the list.

01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:36.400
This was not EGM or some like game.

01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:42.400
You have to remember, Wii Sports broke the mainstream in a way very few video games have.

01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:44.400
It is the top selling video game ever.

01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:46.400
Am I not right?

01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:48.400
100% agree.

01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:52.400
Very unfortunate for us and what we do, our feelings and what we say, but

01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:56.400
Wii Sports is the number one reason why, as you said before,

01:54:57.400 --> 01:55:00.400
the Wii was such a runaway sale, period.

01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:06.400
But I get it. I'm not here to argue with listeners who are commenting on Google for the first time.

01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:08.400
I'm not doing that.

01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:10.400
But I'm just saying, think about it this way.

01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:12.400
Because even though as a gamer you might be like,

01:55:12.400 --> 01:55:15.400
there really isn't much of a game here. I'm just flailing about here.

01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:17.400
Only Wii bowling counts.

01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:20.400
That flailing sold a hell of a lot of systems.

01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:23.400
Elliot B says,

01:55:34.400 --> 01:55:36.400
You know, Portal 2 I'll give you.

01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:38.400
Minecraft, vomit.

01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:40.400
Until someone buys me a copy.

01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:44.400
I'm sorry, but your opinion doesn't count on Minecraft.

01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:48.400
I know that sounds harsh, but I'm sorry.

01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:50.400
Here's the thing I do want to say to be fair.

01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:52.400
Portal 1 is on the list.

01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:54.400
And so they did the whole No Sequels thing.

01:55:54.400 --> 01:55:58.400
So I'm okay with Portal 1 topping Portal 2.

01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:00.400
Minecraft.

01:56:00.400 --> 01:56:04.400
I think that's one of those, let it age like a wine.

01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:06.400
I think in five more years,

01:56:06.400 --> 01:56:11.400
I think we haven't really felt Minecraft's influence yet.

01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:14.400
Batman Arkham City and Minecraft 3,

01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:20.400
Mass Effect 3, were final games in long running series.

01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:22.400
Or the latest games in long running series.

01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:24.400
They had a little different battle to that list.

01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:26.400
So, hmm.

01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:28.400
Let's see.

01:56:28.400 --> 01:56:30.400
Robert G picked up on something.

01:56:30.400 --> 01:56:33.400
It was a good list, but it had some editing problems.

01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:37.400
Atari's adventure screenshot was not from the actual game.

01:56:37.400 --> 01:56:39.400
I have to see if that is...

01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:43.400
Is that not from the game?

01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:45.400
I'm trying to look at it.

01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:47.400
I guess maybe not.

01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:49.400
It looks like a game screenshot,

01:56:49.400 --> 01:56:51.400
but I'm thinking, when do you take the red dragon there?

01:56:51.400 --> 01:56:53.400
Weren't they all in front of little castles?

01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:55.400
Or could you move them around?

01:56:55.400 --> 01:56:57.400
I think someone Googled that and said,

01:56:57.400 --> 01:56:59.400
let's use this one.

01:56:59.400 --> 01:57:01.400
Probably.

01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:03.400
It could have been a hacked image or something like that.

01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:05.400
Maybe.

01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:07.400
We could have found a better one.

01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:09.400
It's like when you go to the movie

01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:11.400
and the trailer isn't in the movie.

01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:13.400
Which happens all the time.

01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:15.400
It happens all the time now.

01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:17.400
That was a big thing in TV commercials for a while, too.

01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:19.400
Yeah, TV commercials for shows.

01:57:19.400 --> 01:57:21.400
All the time.

01:57:21.400 --> 01:57:23.400
That was some of the answers from Google+.

01:57:23.400 --> 01:57:25.400
I'm sorry I didn't read them all,

01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:27.400
but there's some good stuff there,

01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:29.400
so I hope you will check them out.

01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:31.400
Let me read some of the answers from Facebook.

01:57:31.400 --> 01:57:33.400
Critical Myth, also on the VOG Network,

01:57:33.400 --> 01:57:35.400
replies, starting off,

01:57:35.400 --> 01:57:37.400
it was a nice walk through gaming nostalgia,

01:57:37.400 --> 01:57:39.400
could possibly take our subjective likes and dislikes

01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:41.400
and personal histories into account

01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:43.400
to match our expectations or preferences.

01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:45.400
A very good reminder.

01:57:45.400 --> 01:57:47.400
But hey,

01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:49.400
we still have to argue about it anyway, right?

01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:51.400
Tiara,

01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:53.400
our good buddy Tiara from Geek-Life.com

01:57:53.400 --> 01:57:55.400
replies and says,

01:57:55.400 --> 01:57:57.400
don't get me wrong,

01:57:57.400 --> 01:57:59.400
Final Fantasy Tactics is one of my favorite games,

01:57:59.400 --> 01:58:01.400
but how did that make it on the list?

01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:03.400
But Final Fantasy IV and VI didn't.

01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:05.400
Overall, a lot of good choices,

01:58:05.400 --> 01:58:07.400
but some questionable ones as well.

01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:09.400
Well, Tiara, I'm pretty sure IV and VI

01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:11.400
didn't make the list because VII did.

01:58:11.400 --> 01:58:13.400
And now we're gonna go back

01:58:13.400 --> 01:58:15.400
and have that old argument

01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:17.400
about Final Fantasy VII,

01:58:17.400 --> 01:58:19.400
so I'll just let that be.

01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:21.400
Interesting that they did jump.

01:58:21.400 --> 01:58:23.400
Not that the Final Fantasy universe

01:58:23.400 --> 01:58:25.400
was canonical

01:58:25.400 --> 01:58:27.400
from release to release,

01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:29.400
but interesting that they would jump out to Tactics

01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:31.400
in addition to VII.

01:58:31.400 --> 01:58:33.400
Tactics, though, is a completely

01:58:33.400 --> 01:58:35.400
different type of game.

01:58:35.400 --> 01:58:37.400
And I think the argument I was going for

01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:39.400
would be like

01:58:39.400 --> 01:58:41.400
modern Mega Man games,

01:58:41.400 --> 01:58:43.400
like Battle Network, not that I would put them

01:58:43.400 --> 01:58:45.400
in a candidate for top 100, but just saying

01:58:45.400 --> 01:58:47.400
the fact that there are a lot of Mega Man spinoffs

01:58:47.400 --> 01:58:49.400
with completely different play style and whatnot.

01:58:49.400 --> 01:58:51.400
How many other RTSs are in there?

01:58:51.400 --> 01:58:53.400
Like, did they do Breath of Fire?

01:58:53.400 --> 01:58:55.400
It's a big list.

01:58:55.400 --> 01:58:57.400
It's a page list.

01:58:57.400 --> 01:58:59.400
Well, I have a quesadilla in my mouth.

01:58:59.400 --> 01:59:01.400
I'm just using it as an example.

01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:03.400
Did they do Tactics Ogre,

01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:05.400
or anything that was that same style

01:59:05.400 --> 01:59:07.400
of gameplay?

01:59:07.400 --> 01:59:09.400
Final Fantasy Tactics really, I think, took out

01:59:09.400 --> 01:59:11.400
something that was an

01:59:11.400 --> 01:59:13.400
almost niche,

01:59:13.400 --> 01:59:15.400
just slightly outside the niche level,

01:59:15.400 --> 01:59:17.400
and really brought it into

01:59:17.400 --> 01:59:19.400
mainstream, because it was a big

01:59:19.400 --> 01:59:21.400
name that everyone recognized.

01:59:21.400 --> 01:59:23.400
I'm scanning this list real quick

01:59:23.400 --> 01:59:25.400
trying to look for tactical games.

01:59:25.400 --> 01:59:27.400
Desktop Tower Defense,

01:59:27.400 --> 01:59:29.400
I don't even know what that game is.

01:59:29.400 --> 01:59:31.400
That would be tactical.

01:59:31.400 --> 01:59:33.400
It's Tower Defense.

01:59:33.400 --> 01:59:35.400
That's about all you have to say.

01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:37.400
Well, but

01:59:37.400 --> 01:59:39.400
look at all the fucking Tower Defense games

01:59:39.400 --> 01:59:41.400
we have now. That's a huge part of IOS.

01:59:41.400 --> 01:59:43.400
No, I agree with it on the list.

01:59:43.400 --> 01:59:45.400
I'm saying the genre.

01:59:45.400 --> 01:59:47.400
How dare you disagree?

01:59:47.400 --> 01:59:49.400
Not

01:59:49.400 --> 01:59:51.400
a lot of other tactical games on the list.

01:59:51.400 --> 01:59:53.400
I don't see a lot of those

01:59:53.400 --> 01:59:55.400
other games you were mentioning.

01:59:55.400 --> 01:59:57.400
I definitely agree with Jamie's point,

01:59:57.400 --> 01:59:59.400
that Goful World with a Great Story

01:59:59.400 --> 02:00:01.400
gave it a similar enough

02:00:01.400 --> 02:00:03.400
engine, and it is one of the only

02:00:03.400 --> 02:00:05.400
strategy games to hit as wide adoption

02:00:05.400 --> 02:00:07.400
as it did.

02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:09.400
Let's see, some of the other answers from

02:00:09.400 --> 02:00:11.400
Facebook. Daniel S.

02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:13.400
replied and said, yeah, didn't bother with the list.

02:00:13.400 --> 02:00:15.400
They're just bait for more

02:00:15.400 --> 02:00:17.400
page clicks. Check out IGN's

02:00:17.400 --> 02:00:19.400
Top 100 RPGs list.

02:00:19.400 --> 02:00:21.400
They put Persona 4 at number 90.

02:00:21.400 --> 02:00:23.400
I stopped reading lists after that.

02:00:23.400 --> 02:00:25.400
While I don't totally disagree with you,

02:00:25.400 --> 02:00:27.400
one reason I picked this list in particular

02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:29.400
is that it is Time magazine.

02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:31.400
It's not a video game site.

02:00:31.400 --> 02:00:33.400
It's like a news site.

02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:35.400
While yes, to some

02:00:35.400 --> 02:00:37.400
extent, it probably still is bait for page clicks.

02:00:37.400 --> 02:00:39.400
Most things on the internet are.

02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:41.400
I kind of felt there was still

02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:43.400
that history behind the publication.

02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:45.400
It would be different if this is something they were

02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:47.400
putting in their magazine, in

02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:49.400
actual print publication, but it's not.

02:00:49.400 --> 02:00:51.400
Has

02:00:51.400 --> 02:00:53.400
Time done an actual video

02:00:53.400 --> 02:00:55.400
game issue?

02:00:55.400 --> 02:00:57.400
I don't think, well, in the 80s

02:00:57.400 --> 02:00:59.400
probably. But I don't think we've had

02:00:59.400 --> 02:01:01.400
anything modern coming out of there where they actually

02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:03.400
go into the economics behind it, where they go

02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:05.400
into the social aspects behind it, because that's something

02:01:05.400 --> 02:01:07.400
I would put more along the line of

02:01:07.400 --> 02:01:09.400
Time magazine's caliber.

02:01:09.400 --> 02:01:11.400
That's the type of editorial I'd want to see out of

02:01:11.400 --> 02:01:13.400
Time magazine in relation to video games,

02:01:13.400 --> 02:01:15.400
not a Top 100 list.

02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:17.400
Jonathan L. with a good reply

02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:19.400
here on Facebook, well, they're all good, but this one

02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:21.400
particularly caught my attention.

02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:23.400
It seems this is actually a list of

02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:25.400
games that were original for their time,

02:01:25.400 --> 02:01:27.400
rather than a list of the all-time best.

02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:29.400
The Super NES library says

02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:31.400
hi. The list also doesn't

02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:33.400
have any treasure games, DS games,

02:01:33.400 --> 02:01:35.400
arcade music games, 3D sports games,

02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:37.400
3D fighting games, MOBAs, or

02:01:37.400 --> 02:01:39.400
any of the Top 40 games on Twitch TV

02:01:39.400 --> 02:01:41.400
right now. Therefore, it is invalid.

02:01:41.400 --> 02:01:43.400
World of Warcraft has to be

02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:45.400
in the Top 40 of Twitch TV, for with

02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:47.400
all the arena matches that go on on there, so I think you

02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:49.400
might have overlooked that one, but I get your point.

02:01:49.400 --> 02:01:51.400
I hadn't even considered it. DDR isn't a game on the list.

02:01:51.400 --> 02:01:53.400
No, DDR was not on the list.

02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:55.400
Guitar Hero was.

02:01:55.400 --> 02:01:57.400
I wonder if there's any relationship there.

02:01:57.400 --> 02:01:59.400
Everyone knows that DDR ripped off Guitar Hero.

02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:01.400
Here's the thing.

02:02:01.400 --> 02:02:03.400
In America,

02:02:03.400 --> 02:02:05.400
I know this is hard for the long-time

02:02:05.400 --> 02:02:07.400
fans to hear, so just hold your breath

02:02:07.400 --> 02:02:09.400
for a minute, not too long, don't choke.

02:02:09.400 --> 02:02:11.400
Guitar Hero made a

02:02:11.400 --> 02:02:13.400
bigger impact in the States than DDR did.

02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:15.400
Sorry.

02:02:15.400 --> 02:02:17.400
Truth hurts.

02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:19.400
I mean, I won't deny

02:02:19.400 --> 02:02:21.400
the splash that it made.

02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:23.400
Whether it should have or not is another argument.

02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:25.400
I won't argue that.

02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:27.400
Guitar Hero 1 and 2, I had a

02:02:27.400 --> 02:02:29.400
hell of a lot of fun with.

02:02:29.400 --> 02:02:31.400
It was, you know, being

02:02:31.400 --> 02:02:33.400
the Bimani kid all throughout the

02:02:33.400 --> 02:02:35.400
98 release up until

02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:37.400
when did Guitar Hero come out?

02:02:37.400 --> 02:02:39.400
2007, I believe?

02:02:39.400 --> 02:02:41.400
Compared to

02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:43.400
the only other thing that was available at the time,

02:02:43.400 --> 02:02:45.400
I completely and totally welcomed

02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:47.400
songs that I would actually know from

02:02:47.400 --> 02:02:49.400
my youth, a difference

02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:51.400
in the game, and a very excellent

02:02:51.400 --> 02:02:53.400
presentation. It's just

02:02:53.400 --> 02:02:55.400
Guitar Hero and DDR

02:02:55.400 --> 02:02:57.400
are not, I would not put them

02:02:57.400 --> 02:02:59.400
close enough together, and they both

02:02:59.400 --> 02:03:01.400
made a significant

02:03:01.400 --> 02:03:03.400
splash for each their own

02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:05.400
reasons. DDR was ridiculously

02:03:05.400 --> 02:03:07.400
influential in the arcade, even

02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:09.400
though it can't save them. Not in America, anyways.

02:03:09.400 --> 02:03:11.400
And Guitar Hero for,

02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:13.400
you know, less presentation,

02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:15.400
more performance. I will say, though,

02:03:15.400 --> 02:03:17.400
to give to the other

02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:19.400
side of the coin, though, because I am a long-time

02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:21.400
DDR fan, one thing that should be acknowledged

02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:23.400
about Dance Dance Revolution that the Guitar Hero

02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:25.400
can't lay claim to is that

02:03:25.400 --> 02:03:27.400
none of these video games will you find in a PE

02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:29.400
class, but

02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:31.400
DDR is the only game to have broken that barrier.

02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:33.400
So, you know, again,

02:03:33.400 --> 02:03:35.400
maybe it's in that same category as Minecraft.

02:03:35.400 --> 02:03:37.400
DDR in a PE class is

02:03:37.400 --> 02:03:39.400
kind of a new thing. Give it five or ten

02:03:39.400 --> 02:03:41.400
years, and maybe we will have

02:03:41.400 --> 02:03:43.400
accepted it a little more as a culture.

02:03:43.400 --> 02:03:45.400
Maybe Minecraft will soon become

02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:47.400
sculpting class lessons. Who knows?

02:03:47.400 --> 02:03:49.400
Alright, let me read, like, one more of these,

02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:51.400
and I'm so sorry I didn't get to everybody, but

02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:53.400
I want to read this one from Degenerate Johnny.

02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:55.400
It appears to me that most of the

02:03:55.400 --> 02:03:57.400
mainstream media focuses on commercial successes

02:03:57.400 --> 02:03:59.400
or games with a cult following.

02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:01.400
Since this is a top 100 list, it doesn't surprise

02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:03.400
me that Time did the same thing in this scenario.

02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:05.400
The purpose of this list was not

02:04:05.400 --> 02:04:07.400
to inform us gamers, because this is

02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:09.400
something that we can expect from a generalized top

02:04:09.400 --> 02:04:11.400
100 list. This list was to inform

02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:13.400
the magazine's target market,

02:04:13.400 --> 02:04:15.400
which is clearly not us gamers.

02:04:15.400 --> 02:04:17.400
Movie buffs

02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:19.400
don't care about top 100 movie lists for

02:04:19.400 --> 02:04:21.400
magazines such as Time and People. Why should

02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:23.400
we? Playboy features games in

02:04:23.400 --> 02:04:25.400
almost every issue. Should we care about

02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:27.400
this? Only if there's a centerfold of

02:04:27.400 --> 02:04:29.400
our favorite video game female characters,

02:04:29.400 --> 02:04:31.400
or male if you read Playgirl.

02:04:31.400 --> 02:04:33.400
Jamie, quit drooling over the centerfold of

02:04:33.400 --> 02:04:35.400
Garrus. Really?

02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:37.400
Gaming in every issue of Playboy?

02:04:37.400 --> 02:04:39.400
Honestly? I'm pretty sure they do.

02:04:39.400 --> 02:04:41.400
It is a magazine for men. Sure.

02:04:41.400 --> 02:04:43.400
Wow.

02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:45.400
That's just funny to think about. There's not enough

02:04:45.400 --> 02:04:47.400
Turian in my life.

02:04:47.400 --> 02:04:49.400
Okay, before the weird

02:04:49.400 --> 02:04:51.400
turn that comment took in the second half,

02:04:51.400 --> 02:04:53.400
I'm so with you on the first

02:04:53.400 --> 02:04:55.400
half, is that, you know,

02:04:55.400 --> 02:04:57.400
the mainstream media

02:04:57.400 --> 02:04:59.400
focuses on commercial successes or games

02:04:59.400 --> 02:05:01.400
with a cult following. That is where this list really

02:05:01.400 --> 02:05:03.400
came from. Of course. For the record,

02:05:03.400 --> 02:05:05.400
I have to say one thing real quick.

02:05:05.400 --> 02:05:07.400
Do you know what Cleverbot is?

02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:09.400
Uh, is that an AOL bot?

02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:11.400
Kinda. It's actually a website you type stuff in and it

02:05:11.400 --> 02:05:13.400
replies to you. Um, I typed in Turians

02:05:13.400 --> 02:05:15.400
and it replied, I am the very model of a scientist

02:05:15.400 --> 02:05:17.400
Larian.

02:05:17.400 --> 02:05:19.400
Just saying. Cause some nerd

02:05:19.400 --> 02:05:21.400
works at that website. You know it.

02:05:21.400 --> 02:05:23.400
Oh, there's Portal ones on here too. Alright, thank you to

02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:25.400
everybody on both Facebook and Google+. I'm

02:05:25.400 --> 02:05:27.400
sorry if I didn't read your answer, but we are

02:05:27.400 --> 02:05:29.400
running a little long tonight. I encourage you to visit

02:05:29.400 --> 02:05:31.400
both of our communities on Google+.

02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:33.400
Search for Orange Lounge Radio or

02:05:33.400 --> 02:05:35.400
Facebook. Go to Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:37.400
I encourage you to go and read

02:05:37.400 --> 02:05:39.400
all of the responses and click like

02:05:39.400 --> 02:05:41.400
or plus one. Or if you're on the

02:05:41.400 --> 02:05:43.400
Wii U, you can click YEAH!

02:05:43.400 --> 02:05:45.400
YEAH! YEAH!

02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:47.400
Cause that's the new, cause obviously

02:05:47.400 --> 02:05:49.400
like and plus one are trademark terms. So there's

02:05:49.400 --> 02:05:51.400
it was either YEAH or YEAH.

02:05:51.400 --> 02:05:53.400
It's one of the two. Y-E-A-H.

02:05:53.400 --> 02:05:55.400
Why do they have like plus coins or something?

02:05:55.400 --> 02:05:57.400
That actually would have been a good idea.

02:05:57.400 --> 02:05:59.400
Or one up. Cause Nintendo

02:05:59.400 --> 02:06:01.400
just thought of it yesterday.

02:06:01.400 --> 02:06:03.400
No, no, today.

02:06:03.400 --> 02:06:05.400
Actually a one up is really fucking cute.

02:06:05.400 --> 02:06:07.400
Yeah it is.

02:06:07.400 --> 02:06:09.400
Loki, I think you should go work for Nintendo.

02:06:09.400 --> 02:06:11.400
Oh because I know what the internet is.

02:06:11.400 --> 02:06:13.400
Instead of like, what did you just

02:06:13.400 --> 02:06:15.400
introduce? What did you speak of?

02:06:15.400 --> 02:06:17.400
Be surprised. Why not?

02:06:17.400 --> 02:06:19.400
Alright. We have to make

02:06:19.400 --> 02:06:21.400
we have to make screen name.

02:06:21.400 --> 02:06:23.400
We'll attach it to the

02:06:23.400 --> 02:06:25.400
console and what if their console breaks?

02:06:25.400 --> 02:06:27.400
Our consoles never break you!

02:06:27.400 --> 02:06:29.400
Death to you! I don't know.

02:06:29.400 --> 02:06:31.400
Alright, Loki.

02:06:31.400 --> 02:06:33.400
How about some real news?

02:06:33.400 --> 02:06:35.400
Some real news. Okay.

02:06:35.400 --> 02:06:37.400
Let's talk about Black Ops 2.

02:06:37.400 --> 02:06:39.400
Black Ops 2, big surprise.

02:06:39.400 --> 02:06:41.400
Biggest title of the year.

02:06:41.400 --> 02:06:43.400
It has broken all sorts of records.

02:06:43.400 --> 02:06:45.400
You know, Modern Warfare 3 of course

02:06:45.400 --> 02:06:47.400
sold 6.5 million copies in the

02:06:47.400 --> 02:06:49.400
US and UK.

02:06:49.400 --> 02:06:51.400
And you know, the previous record

02:06:51.400 --> 02:06:53.400
was 400 million dollars

02:06:53.400 --> 02:06:55.400
in the first day.

02:06:55.400 --> 02:06:57.400
Black Ops 2 beat that

02:06:57.400 --> 02:06:59.400
with 500 million

02:06:59.400 --> 02:07:01.400
dollars in the first day.

02:07:01.400 --> 02:07:03.400
So that's a lot of game.

02:07:03.400 --> 02:07:05.400
And the

02:07:05.400 --> 02:07:07.400
biggest entertainment launch in

02:07:07.400 --> 02:07:09.400
history.

02:07:09.400 --> 02:07:11.400
So, hooray.

02:07:11.400 --> 02:07:13.400
And I'm sure next year you'll

02:07:13.400 --> 02:07:15.400
maybe beat your record again.

02:07:15.400 --> 02:07:17.400
Modern Warfare 4 will break it.

02:07:17.400 --> 02:07:19.400
Black Ops 3 will break it.

02:07:19.400 --> 02:07:21.400
Well, if there's new consoles

02:07:21.400 --> 02:07:23.400
next year though, that could throw an interesting monkey

02:07:23.400 --> 02:07:25.400
wrench in the situation. Nah, because they'll make it for the other

02:07:25.400 --> 02:07:27.400
consoles as well. That's true. There'll be

02:07:27.400 --> 02:07:29.400
that little while where they're making it for

02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:31.400
everything. Because there's the Wii U version.

02:07:31.400 --> 02:07:33.400
Are they still making PlayStation

02:07:33.400 --> 02:07:35.400
2 versions? Nope.

02:07:35.400 --> 02:07:37.400
That stopped with World

02:07:37.400 --> 02:07:39.400
of War. Not as of

02:07:39.400 --> 02:07:41.400
the big titles, but I was actually glancing

02:07:41.400 --> 02:07:43.400
over and you guys were doing release dates and I do still see

02:07:43.400 --> 02:07:45.400
some new title PlayStation 2 versions.

02:07:45.400 --> 02:07:47.400
Pro Evo.

02:07:47.400 --> 02:07:49.400
Pro Evo, just like the Wii version.

02:07:49.400 --> 02:07:51.400
FIFA was just like the

02:07:51.400 --> 02:07:53.400
same thing. Those are just rehashed versions

02:07:53.400 --> 02:07:55.400
They're there, just saying.

02:07:55.400 --> 02:07:57.400
New PlayStation 2 titles are crazy to me.

02:07:57.400 --> 02:07:59.400
To be fair though, didn't we discuss on a prior show

02:07:59.400 --> 02:08:01.400
that really the only PlayStation 2 game

02:08:01.400 --> 02:08:03.400
that's left to come out is the Final Fantasy 11

02:08:03.400 --> 02:08:05.400
expansion? I want to say that came up in a prior show.

02:08:05.400 --> 02:08:07.400
That like, here's what you have to look forward

02:08:07.400 --> 02:08:09.400
to in 2013.

02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:11.400
One PlayStation 2 game.

02:08:11.400 --> 02:08:13.400
11 expansion? Mhm.

02:08:13.400 --> 02:08:15.400
Oh, duh. Nevermind.

02:08:15.400 --> 02:08:17.400
Alright.

02:08:17.400 --> 02:08:19.400
So yeah, lots of money.

02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:21.400
Alright, moving on to

02:08:21.400 --> 02:08:23.400
LEGO Lord of the Rings.

02:08:23.400 --> 02:08:25.400
I know some of y'all are excited about The Hobbit.

02:08:25.400 --> 02:08:27.400
And so of course, up comes

02:08:27.400 --> 02:08:29.400
all the new tie-in games with this.

02:08:29.400 --> 02:08:31.400
So there's LEGO Lord of the Rings, which I guess

02:08:31.400 --> 02:08:33.400
granted, LEGO is kind of its own little

02:08:33.400 --> 02:08:35.400
monster gaming series, but regardless.

02:08:35.400 --> 02:08:37.400
The Xbox

02:08:37.400 --> 02:08:39.400
360 version of this came out

02:08:39.400 --> 02:08:41.400
just this past week, but here's

02:08:41.400 --> 02:08:43.400
something crazy.

02:08:43.400 --> 02:08:45.400
I guess some demo discs

02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:47.400
as opposed to retail game discs

02:08:47.400 --> 02:08:49.400
got shipped out to retailers.

02:08:49.400 --> 02:08:51.400
Not quite.

02:08:51.400 --> 02:08:53.400
Oh, really?

02:08:53.400 --> 02:08:55.400
The retail discs actually got shipped

02:08:55.400 --> 02:08:57.400
out, but they were labeled as demo discs.

02:08:57.400 --> 02:08:59.400
So they weren't

02:08:59.400 --> 02:09:01.400
actually demo discs, it's just

02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:03.400
a demo copy on it. But what

02:09:03.400 --> 02:09:05.400
a collector's item that is, because

02:09:05.400 --> 02:09:07.400
these stories are saying, quick, you better take them back

02:09:07.400 --> 02:09:09.400
and get them exchanged. Hell no, you

02:09:09.400 --> 02:09:11.400
shouldn't hang onto that thing. That's gonna

02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:13.400
be money to some

02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:15.400
collector. It's only a small

02:09:15.400 --> 02:09:17.400
it's not all of them, like in fact,

02:09:17.400 --> 02:09:19.400
all the ones we got shipped were not like that.

02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:21.400
Microsoft to Walmart, Target,

02:09:21.400 --> 02:09:23.400
and Toys R Us is the places

02:09:23.400 --> 02:09:25.400
you're gonna find this, so not

02:09:25.400 --> 02:09:27.400
on pod distribution. Sorry, Loki.

02:09:27.400 --> 02:09:29.400
Nah, sorry, I got my little big

02:09:29.400 --> 02:09:31.400
planet.

02:09:31.400 --> 02:09:33.400
So, yeah, very, very

02:09:33.400 --> 02:09:35.400
interesting. So they are doing an official

02:09:35.400 --> 02:09:37.400
recall. You can contact WB

02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:39.400
Games either by email or by

02:09:39.400 --> 02:09:41.400
phone, but at the same time,

02:09:41.400 --> 02:09:43.400
if the disc really is

02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:45.400
the game, then hooray, you have the game.

02:09:45.400 --> 02:09:47.400
I say enjoy it

02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:49.400
and then keep that thing in good condition

02:09:49.400 --> 02:09:51.400
because a collector may want that someday.

02:09:51.400 --> 02:09:53.400
Maybe. I don't know.

02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:55.400
I mean, it might be stretching it a bit. It's no

02:09:55.400 --> 02:09:57.400
what's that frickin'

02:09:57.400 --> 02:09:59.400
NES game?

02:09:59.400 --> 02:10:01.400
Stadium Events?

02:10:01.400 --> 02:10:03.400
What's that game that was for the NES

02:10:03.400 --> 02:10:05.400
power pad? It was World Class Track Meet before

02:10:05.400 --> 02:10:07.400
World Class Track Meet.

02:10:07.400 --> 02:10:09.400
I think it was Stadium Events. That thing goes for

02:10:09.400 --> 02:10:11.400
like, buku bucks now.

02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:13.400
Or the

02:10:13.400 --> 02:10:15.400
competition cartridges from like

02:10:15.400 --> 02:10:17.400
Nintendo World Championships.

02:10:17.400 --> 02:10:19.400
Oh, I thought you were gonna say like the Blockbuster

02:10:19.400 --> 02:10:21.400
Championship thing. Those too. All those cartridges

02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:23.400
go for buku bucks too, so

02:10:23.400 --> 02:10:25.400
misprints and shit.

02:10:25.400 --> 02:10:27.400
Dark Soccer, you collect old stuff. I have a

02:10:27.400 --> 02:10:29.400
Monopoly.

02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:31.400
Oh. That's right, a

02:10:31.400 --> 02:10:33.400
Monopoly. And that was on

02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:35.400
Genesis? No, Master System.

02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:37.400
I have two of them.

02:10:37.400 --> 02:10:39.400
And I have an actual monopoly.

02:10:39.400 --> 02:10:41.400
Alright.

02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:43.400
Let's move on with some more

02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:45.400
no, not more news.

02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:47.400
Yes.

02:10:47.400 --> 02:10:49.400
More news. I'm kidding.

02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:51.400
I'm not with it tonight. Dark Soccer.

02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:53.400
Well, in other news.

02:10:53.400 --> 02:10:55.400
And I'm gonna

02:10:55.400 --> 02:10:57.400
mispronounce the name of this game because I'm not sure

02:10:57.400 --> 02:10:59.400
exactly how it's said. Is it Arm A?

02:10:59.400 --> 02:11:01.400
Arm A3? Arma.

02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:03.400
Arma? Arma 3? Okay. Because it's not a game I'm

02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:05.400
super interested in, but I'm pretty pissed off

02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:07.400
about the situation.

02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:09.400
The developers, Ivan, I guess it's

02:11:09.400 --> 02:11:11.400
Buchta and Martin Pezlar

02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:13.400
are, actually

02:11:13.400 --> 02:11:15.400
have been held in jail for

02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:17.400
70 days in Greece.

02:11:17.400 --> 02:11:19.400
Because they have been

02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:21.400
charged with espionage.

02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:23.400
They've actually now been refused bail

02:11:23.400 --> 02:11:25.400
and have to be tried in front of a

02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:27.400
Greek court. And this is

02:11:27.400 --> 02:11:29.400
coming from the Czech

02:11:29.400 --> 02:11:31.400
news site Roslas.

02:11:31.400 --> 02:11:33.400
Excuse me.

02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:35.400
They've been made to wake weeks

02:11:35.400 --> 02:11:37.400
longer because of a

02:11:37.400 --> 02:11:39.400
strike in the Greek legal system.

02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:41.400
They've been accused of spying on

02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:43.400
Greek military installations and face up to

02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:45.400
20 years in jail.

02:11:45.400 --> 02:11:47.400
The shooter itself was based on the island where

02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:49.400
they were arrested. And they

02:11:49.400 --> 02:11:51.400
said that they were just there on holiday.

02:11:51.400 --> 02:11:53.400
So, um,

02:11:53.400 --> 02:11:55.400
they're, and this is just a quote

02:11:55.400 --> 02:11:57.400
from, um, Ivan's father.

02:11:57.400 --> 02:11:59.400
They're in a cell with over 25 people.

02:11:59.400 --> 02:12:01.400
They sleep on the ground. They have food twice

02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:03.400
a day. Um, they no longer

02:12:03.400 --> 02:12:05.400
tell us on the phone that it's alright that

02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:07.400
they're handling it. After the

02:12:07.400 --> 02:12:09.400
court's decision, we only hear

02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:11.400
from them something no parent ever wants to hear.

02:12:11.400 --> 02:12:13.400
Mom, Dad, please save us.

02:12:13.400 --> 02:12:15.400
So, um, the

02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:17.400
people have been, um,

02:12:17.400 --> 02:12:19.400
writing to the Czech president

02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:21.400
and prime minister saying that the foreign ministry

02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:23.400
hasn't been doing enough. And the

02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:25.400
foreign ministry spokesperson says that they're

02:12:25.400 --> 02:12:27.400
trying to work it from all angles and trying to help

02:12:27.400 --> 02:12:29.400
them out. So,

02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:31.400
yeah.

02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:33.400
Yeah.

02:12:33.400 --> 02:12:35.400
Yeah, it's an ongoing

02:12:35.400 --> 02:12:37.400
saga. We heard about that before.

02:12:37.400 --> 02:12:39.400
And, um, they may be in there a little while,

02:12:39.400 --> 02:12:41.400
huh? Well, let's hope not.

02:12:41.400 --> 02:12:43.400
Alright, uh, let's move on.

02:12:43.400 --> 02:12:45.400
We're almost to the mailbag. The FUs of the Week.

02:12:45.400 --> 02:12:47.400
And soon, Skype line at 1877

02:12:47.400 --> 02:12:49.400
Game OLR or Orange

02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:51.400
L'Anterio on Skype. But first, Loki.

02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:53.400
And this is kind of unfortunate on the whole

02:12:53.400 --> 02:12:55.400
mobile front. And actually, I think it's on

02:12:55.400 --> 02:12:57.400
PC as well, if I remember correctly. Um,

02:12:57.400 --> 02:12:59.400
but Open Faint, the kind of

02:12:59.400 --> 02:13:01.400
alternative to using

02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:03.400
Gamer Room, at least on the iOS platform, and

02:13:03.400 --> 02:13:05.400
well, it was one of

02:13:05.400 --> 02:13:07.400
the only kind of multi-platform

02:13:07.400 --> 02:13:09.400
kind of, uh,

02:13:09.400 --> 02:13:11.400
hubs for

02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:13.400
even the Android marketplace. Well,

02:13:13.400 --> 02:13:15.400
you may remember GREE

02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:17.400
purchased Open Faint,

02:13:17.400 --> 02:13:19.400
its parent company, back in April

02:13:19.400 --> 02:13:21.400
2011. Well, now,

02:13:21.400 --> 02:13:23.400
Open Faint is gonna be

02:13:23.400 --> 02:13:25.400
shut down. And they're

02:13:25.400 --> 02:13:27.400
shutting down the service starting, um,

02:13:27.400 --> 02:13:29.400
well, actually effective December 14th.

02:13:29.400 --> 02:13:31.400
And in its place is gonna be GREE's

02:13:31.400 --> 02:13:33.400
platform that they have, which I've

02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:35.400
not experienced yet.

02:13:35.400 --> 02:13:37.400
You know what's funny is, uh,

02:13:37.400 --> 02:13:39.400
this is what I was teasing about before the break.

02:13:39.400 --> 02:13:41.400
Um, one of our listeners, Peter Uno, he always

02:13:41.400 --> 02:13:43.400
does these little live blogs as he's listening to the show.

02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:45.400
And he was listening to the podcast today.

02:13:45.400 --> 02:13:47.400
And he said about the show,

02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:49.400
haha, you just mentioned

02:13:49.400 --> 02:13:51.400
Open Faint not going out of business.

02:13:51.400 --> 02:13:53.400
Because we were having that conversation last week about, like,

02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:55.400
things coexisting. And one of us brought up,

02:13:55.400 --> 02:13:57.400
I think it was me, brought up the whole, well, you have

02:13:57.400 --> 02:13:59.400
Game Center, but it didn't put Open Faint out of

02:13:59.400 --> 02:14:01.400
business. Oops. Well, it didn't.

02:14:01.400 --> 02:14:03.400
It's just, it's, you know,

02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:05.400
becoming something else. Yeah, it is

02:14:05.400 --> 02:14:07.400
still a little bit funny.

02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:09.400
And, of course, Peter Uno brings it up because

02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:11.400
GREE is a Japanese company.

02:14:11.400 --> 02:14:13.400
And very prominent for those titles over there.

02:14:13.400 --> 02:14:15.400
Ah. And, you know, it didn't really

02:14:15.400 --> 02:14:17.400
make the regional cross. I remember,

02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:19.400
uh,

02:14:19.400 --> 02:14:21.400
early days of the, of these

02:14:21.400 --> 02:14:23.400
networks really coming out, Aurora Faint

02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:25.400
turned into Open Faint. And it was

02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:27.400
just a runaway hit. And I... Wasn't Aurora

02:14:27.400 --> 02:14:29.400
Faint the game? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:14:29.400 --> 02:14:31.400
Aurora Faint had

02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:33.400
its little social hub network

02:14:33.400 --> 02:14:35.400
within game. And whenever

02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:37.400
they started... That was a huge game in the

02:14:37.400 --> 02:14:39.400
early days of iOS. And whenever they opened

02:14:39.400 --> 02:14:41.400
their network, their platform to other

02:14:41.400 --> 02:14:43.400
people is how it became Open Faint

02:14:43.400 --> 02:14:45.400
that others could use. I mean,

02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:47.400
Open Faint in America, Open Faint

02:14:47.400 --> 02:14:49.400
beat out N.G. Mokos++,

02:14:49.400 --> 02:14:51.400
who I think was also bought by

02:14:51.400 --> 02:14:53.400
GREE, um,

02:14:53.400 --> 02:14:55.400
uh, that beat out Plus Plus. It

02:14:55.400 --> 02:14:57.400
beat out Crystal or...

02:14:57.400 --> 02:14:59.400
Crystal's still lagging.

02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:01.400
I don't see it very often. But Open Faint

02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:03.400
I see everywhere. And now,

02:15:03.400 --> 02:15:05.400
for it to go away and

02:15:05.400 --> 02:15:07.400
to cease functioning this

02:15:07.400 --> 02:15:09.400
soon is kinda crazy

02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:11.400
in my mind.

02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:13.400
Alright. Well, let's move on

02:15:13.400 --> 02:15:15.400
to a story about another lawsuit in the gaming

02:15:15.400 --> 02:15:17.400
world. Jamie, I'm really interested on your take

02:15:17.400 --> 02:15:19.400
on this as a designer. This is really

02:15:19.400 --> 02:15:21.400
interesting and kinda somebody who has

02:15:21.400 --> 02:15:23.400
to be aware of, like, copyright

02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:25.400
work when it comes to design.

02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:27.400
This has to do with tattoos.

02:15:27.400 --> 02:15:29.400
So a tattoo artist has sued

02:15:29.400 --> 02:15:31.400
THQ. And if there's one company

02:15:31.400 --> 02:15:33.400
that can't afford a lawsuit right now, it's THQ.

02:15:33.400 --> 02:15:35.400
But a tattoo artist sued

02:15:35.400 --> 02:15:37.400
THQ over some

02:15:37.400 --> 02:15:39.400
tattoo art that is seen in

02:15:39.400 --> 02:15:41.400
UFC Undisputed 2010

02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:43.400
and UFC Undisputed 3.

02:15:43.400 --> 02:15:45.400
The tattoo artist is named Chris

02:15:45.400 --> 02:15:47.400
Escobedo

02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:49.400
and he filed a lawsuit against THQ

02:15:49.400 --> 02:15:51.400
because of a tattoo

02:15:51.400 --> 02:15:53.400
that he has copyrighted

02:15:53.400 --> 02:15:55.400
that is on MMA fighter Carlos

02:15:55.400 --> 02:15:57.400
Condit in these UFC

02:15:57.400 --> 02:15:59.400
games. Now, his argument

02:15:59.400 --> 02:16:01.400
says that even though his

02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:03.400
tattoo is on

02:16:03.400 --> 02:16:05.400
this public figure, the

02:16:05.400 --> 02:16:07.400
tattoo's design still belongs to

02:16:07.400 --> 02:16:09.400
him. He created it originally.

02:16:09.400 --> 02:16:11.400
He never signed the rights to the

02:16:11.400 --> 02:16:13.400
design-awaited Condit. So by

02:16:13.400 --> 02:16:15.400
digitally recreating the design,

02:16:15.400 --> 02:16:17.400
which, you know, THQ did,

02:16:17.400 --> 02:16:19.400
THQ is said to

02:16:19.400 --> 02:16:21.400
have, in this lawsuit, violated

02:16:21.400 --> 02:16:23.400
Escobedo's copyright

02:16:23.400 --> 02:16:25.400
on the work.

02:16:25.400 --> 02:16:27.400
The lawsuit goes on to say that THQ using

02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:29.400
Condit's likeness on the website

02:16:29.400 --> 02:16:31.400
violates Escobedo's copyright

02:16:31.400 --> 02:16:33.400
as well. The lawsuit wants

02:16:33.400 --> 02:16:35.400
actual damages caused by THQ's

02:16:35.400 --> 02:16:37.400
use of the artwork, as well

02:16:37.400 --> 02:16:39.400
as an order directing THQ

02:16:39.400 --> 02:16:41.400
to account to Mr.

02:16:41.400 --> 02:16:43.400
Escobedo

02:16:43.400 --> 02:16:45.400
for all gains, profits, and advantages

02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:47.400
derived by them by their

02:16:47.400 --> 02:16:49.400
wrongful conduct and to

02:16:49.400 --> 02:16:51.400
disgorge all profits obtained by their

02:16:51.400 --> 02:16:53.400
wrongful conduct.

02:16:53.400 --> 02:16:55.400
He's got a legal point,

02:16:55.400 --> 02:16:57.400
but, honestly, this is

02:16:57.400 --> 02:16:59.400
just being selfish and greedy.

02:16:59.400 --> 02:17:01.400
I mean, maybe he's got bills that need to be paid.

02:17:01.400 --> 02:17:03.400
I don't know.

02:17:03.400 --> 02:17:05.400
But, I mean, if I did

02:17:05.400 --> 02:17:07.400
a design, you know,

02:17:07.400 --> 02:17:09.400
that's... Now, if it's something

02:17:09.400 --> 02:17:11.400
that

02:17:11.400 --> 02:17:13.400
wasn't being worn on a human

02:17:13.400 --> 02:17:15.400
body, like, if it was, like, say,

02:17:15.400 --> 02:17:17.400
a banner, or something, or

02:17:17.400 --> 02:17:19.400
some, like, actual artwork

02:17:19.400 --> 02:17:21.400
that I put up, you know, as

02:17:21.400 --> 02:17:23.400
something on display, and they

02:17:23.400 --> 02:17:25.400
used that, like, as a logo, or

02:17:25.400 --> 02:17:27.400
something you

02:17:27.400 --> 02:17:29.400
specifically, with the intention

02:17:29.400 --> 02:17:31.400
of making money off of it,

02:17:31.400 --> 02:17:33.400
instead of actually recreating

02:17:33.400 --> 02:17:35.400
a personal likeness,

02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:37.400
then, yeah, I would, I would kinda go after

02:17:37.400 --> 02:17:39.400
that. I would say, you know, you're using something

02:17:39.400 --> 02:17:41.400
that I did, and making money,

02:17:41.400 --> 02:17:43.400
using it for the express purpose of making money.

02:17:43.400 --> 02:17:45.400
All they did was recreate

02:17:45.400 --> 02:17:47.400
a likeness, and the guy licensed

02:17:47.400 --> 02:17:49.400
his likeness, which includes

02:17:49.400 --> 02:17:51.400
everything attached to his likeness.

02:17:51.400 --> 02:17:53.400
Do you think maybe the tattoo artist

02:17:53.400 --> 02:17:55.400
should be going after this

02:17:55.400 --> 02:17:57.400
fighter? Because the fighter should've known

02:17:57.400 --> 02:17:59.400
about this before he licensed it. Well, on

02:17:59.400 --> 02:18:01.400
top of that, when you do a tattoo for

02:18:01.400 --> 02:18:03.400
somebody, as far as I

02:18:03.400 --> 02:18:05.400
understand, unless you

02:18:05.400 --> 02:18:07.400
have filed a legit copyright

02:18:07.400 --> 02:18:09.400
on this item, first

02:18:09.400 --> 02:18:11.400
of all, the, um,

02:18:11.400 --> 02:18:13.400
the fighter should've been up

02:18:13.400 --> 02:18:15.400
front and said something if there was an

02:18:15.400 --> 02:18:17.400
actual, uh,

02:18:17.400 --> 02:18:19.400
copyright filed.

02:18:19.400 --> 02:18:21.400
If there's not a copyright filed

02:18:21.400 --> 02:18:23.400
on it, this guy has no ground to stand on.

02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:25.400
You know,

02:18:25.400 --> 02:18:27.400
in fact, I think it's any,

02:18:27.400 --> 02:18:29.400
um, unless this guy, it's this guy's

02:18:29.400 --> 02:18:31.400
private business, I think that any

02:18:31.400 --> 02:18:33.400
tattoo artist, unless they're, like,

02:18:33.400 --> 02:18:35.400
an independent contractor,

02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:37.400
listens over their work to the studio they do

02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:39.400
the work for. Uh, Loki, I want to get to your thoughts,

02:18:39.400 --> 02:18:41.400
too, as well as Jason, if he has any, but, um,

02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:43.400
going to the chat room, because this is the exact same

02:18:43.400 --> 02:18:45.400
thing I thought of. DukeNukem at

02:18:45.400 --> 02:18:47.400
live.vognetwork.com says, didn't the

02:18:47.400 --> 02:18:49.400
same kind of thing happen with the Tyson tattoo

02:18:49.400 --> 02:18:51.400
in the Hangover Part 2? I believe

02:18:51.400 --> 02:18:53.400
it did. That's the exact same thing I thought of, is that

02:18:53.400 --> 02:18:55.400
they had to go, like, digitally re-

02:18:55.400 --> 02:18:57.400
re-do that guy. Uh, Loki,

02:18:57.400 --> 02:18:59.400
your thought. Well, I was just gonna say, I don't think it's anything

02:18:59.400 --> 02:19:01.400
that, I, can you even

02:19:01.400 --> 02:19:03.400
do that? I mean, because if you think about it,

02:19:03.400 --> 02:19:05.400
you, you have this copyright thing,

02:19:05.400 --> 02:19:07.400
so he can't make any, you know, public

02:19:07.400 --> 02:19:09.400
appearances anywhere, because if he's captured on

02:19:09.400 --> 02:19:11.400
camera, oh, it's a, it's a copyright

02:19:11.400 --> 02:19:13.400
violation. That seems a little stupid,

02:19:13.400 --> 02:19:15.400
like, if you, if you're putting it on somebody.

02:19:15.400 --> 02:19:17.400
Now, if it was something blatant, like, he

02:19:17.400 --> 02:19:19.400
had him tattoo Nintendo's logo on

02:19:19.400 --> 02:19:21.400
his face or something like that, then,

02:19:21.400 --> 02:19:23.400
that's a little kind of- What about that guy who got the

02:19:23.400 --> 02:19:25.400
Romney tattoos all over the

02:19:25.400 --> 02:19:27.400
internet this week? I'm actually checking with one of my

02:19:27.400 --> 02:19:29.400
favorite sites ever, Freakonomics.

02:19:29.400 --> 02:19:31.400
I love Freakonomics.

02:19:31.400 --> 02:19:33.400
Um, they're basically going

02:19:33.400 --> 02:19:35.400
on here, and they're going over that case, they're talking about

02:19:35.400 --> 02:19:37.400
the hangover part two, um,

02:19:37.400 --> 02:19:39.400
about the art appearing without the

02:19:39.400 --> 02:19:41.400
artist's consent.

02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:43.400
Um, okay.

02:19:43.400 --> 02:19:45.400
Alright, if the film-

02:19:45.400 --> 02:19:47.400
I'm gonna read this paragraph here.

02:19:47.400 --> 02:19:49.400
If the film had featured an etching by

02:19:49.400 --> 02:19:51.400
Whitmill, who's the guy, the studio

02:19:51.400 --> 02:19:53.400
would have had to get the rights to show it, and the film

02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:55.400
cleared. That is approved by the copyright owner.

02:19:55.400 --> 02:19:57.400
That clearance process is a major headache

02:19:57.400 --> 02:19:59.400
for a lot of filmmakers, especially documentarians

02:19:59.400 --> 02:20:01.400
who film real life, and

02:20:01.400 --> 02:20:03.400
therefore capture things like songs, TV shows,

02:20:03.400 --> 02:20:05.400
and artwork. The same rule applies to

02:20:05.400 --> 02:20:07.400
the tattoo. So far, so good for

02:20:07.400 --> 02:20:09.400
Whitmill. Okay. And then,

02:20:09.400 --> 02:20:11.400
so they're basically using it

02:20:11.400 --> 02:20:13.400
as that. Now, they're asking, does Warner Brothers

02:20:13.400 --> 02:20:15.400
have a way out? The studio may claim that the tattoo

02:20:15.400 --> 02:20:17.400
is not original, that it was inspired by

02:20:17.400 --> 02:20:19.400
Maori tattoos. Um,

02:20:19.400 --> 02:20:21.400
this is unlikely to work. Copyright's

02:20:21.400 --> 02:20:23.400
originality threshold is very low. Even

02:20:23.400 --> 02:20:25.400
if Whitmill adapted his design

02:20:25.400 --> 02:20:27.400
from one in the public domain, it will

02:20:27.400 --> 02:20:29.400
nonetheless be copyrightable if not

02:20:29.400 --> 02:20:31.400
copied exactly. If it

02:20:31.400 --> 02:20:33.400
is not copied exactly.

02:20:33.400 --> 02:20:35.400
Alright, before we move on to the mailbag,

02:20:35.400 --> 02:20:37.400
anything? Oh. One last thing. Uh-huh.

02:20:37.400 --> 02:20:39.400
They say that it is also, though, quite

02:20:39.400 --> 02:20:41.400
likely protected under fair use doctrine.

02:20:41.400 --> 02:20:43.400
Oh.

02:20:43.400 --> 02:20:45.400
Mm. Interesting.

02:20:45.400 --> 02:20:47.400
Um. I voted for Freakonomics on Podcast

02:20:47.400 --> 02:20:49.400
Awards.

02:20:49.400 --> 02:20:51.400
Best one in their category that I saw. I love

02:20:51.400 --> 02:20:53.400
I actually had the Freakonomics

02:20:53.400 --> 02:20:55.400
desk calendar. I used it for

02:20:55.400 --> 02:20:57.400
three years. I would get it every

02:20:57.400 --> 02:20:59.400
year. You learn a lot

02:20:59.400 --> 02:21:01.400
from this website. Anyway, just saying.

02:21:01.400 --> 02:21:03.400
But yeah, that came from Freakonomics.com

02:21:03.400 --> 02:21:05.400
Um, copyright. Blah blah.

02:21:05.400 --> 02:21:07.400
Alright.

02:21:07.400 --> 02:21:09.400
Yeah, I was gonna ask the same question.

02:21:09.400 --> 02:21:11.400
Why isn't this an issue on especially

02:21:11.400 --> 02:21:13.400
pay-per-view, uh, mixed

02:21:13.400 --> 02:21:15.400
martial arts, pay-per-view, uh,

02:21:15.400 --> 02:21:17.400
UFC broadcasts? Um,

02:21:17.400 --> 02:21:19.400
you know, licensing. God

02:21:19.400 --> 02:21:21.400
only knows what happens behind the scenes, but I'm

02:21:21.400 --> 02:21:23.400
surprised that this hasn't come up before.

02:21:23.400 --> 02:21:25.400
Um, scary situation.

02:21:25.400 --> 02:21:27.400
The, before having

02:21:27.400 --> 02:21:29.400
known those details, I was gonna say

02:21:29.400 --> 02:21:31.400
flat out that this is, this is

02:21:31.400 --> 02:21:33.400
Carlos Condit's problems, and he's on the hook

02:21:33.400 --> 02:21:35.400
for this problem for any license

02:21:35.400 --> 02:21:37.400
agreement broken or otherwise.

02:21:37.400 --> 02:21:39.400
I kind of agree with you, is that,

02:21:39.400 --> 02:21:41.400
you know, before you get a piece of art

02:21:41.400 --> 02:21:43.400
permanently put on your body, you better think about

02:21:43.400 --> 02:21:45.400
who owns that art. And you wanna say that

02:21:45.400 --> 02:21:47.400
at the same time, you wanna say

02:21:47.400 --> 02:21:49.400
original or not, it's a tattoo

02:21:49.400 --> 02:21:51.400
and it's there. Unless you're getting it on

02:21:51.400 --> 02:21:53.400
your butt where no one will ever see it.

02:21:53.400 --> 02:21:55.400
But special people. Clearly not the

02:21:55.400 --> 02:21:57.400
case in this situation, but of course.

02:21:57.400 --> 02:21:59.400
Yeah, I, that, this is a,

02:21:59.400 --> 02:22:01.400
that's a, that's a really crappy situation.

02:22:01.400 --> 02:22:03.400
I, not having the expertise,

02:22:03.400 --> 02:22:05.400
I don't really wanna comment anymore, but that's a scary thought.

02:22:05.400 --> 02:22:07.400
I do still think it's a case of money-grabbing.

02:22:07.400 --> 02:22:09.400
I'm gonna get the copyright Mike Tyson

02:22:09.400 --> 02:22:11.400
tattoo on my butt and no one will ever

02:22:11.400 --> 02:22:13.400
know, and I'll get away with a crime.

02:22:13.400 --> 02:22:15.400
You know what's gonna happen is

02:22:15.400 --> 02:22:17.400
that THQ, somebody is gonna shell out

02:22:17.400 --> 02:22:19.400
damages and there's gonna be a patch that's gonna

02:22:19.400 --> 02:22:21.400
be devoted to removing this in-game. Period.

02:22:21.400 --> 02:22:23.400
That's, that's the era we live in.

02:22:23.400 --> 02:22:25.400
You know that there's gonna be a patch that adds in

02:22:25.400 --> 02:22:27.400
a special copyright notice.

02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:29.400
Or licensed from

02:22:29.400 --> 02:22:31.400
A 1K patch with tensed alterations.

02:22:31.400 --> 02:22:33.400
This is all time that THQ could spend

02:22:33.400 --> 02:22:35.400
working on like something to make them money.

02:22:35.400 --> 02:22:37.400
Something to entertain people.

02:22:37.400 --> 02:22:39.400
So, alright

02:22:39.400 --> 02:22:41.400
let's go to the mailbag. Every week you guys

02:22:41.400 --> 02:22:43.400
send us emails. Mailbag at

02:22:43.400 --> 02:22:45.400
orangelaunchradio.com and we read

02:22:45.400 --> 02:22:47.400
some of our favorites here on the show.

02:22:47.400 --> 02:22:49.400
DarkSakura has asked me to dive

02:22:49.400 --> 02:22:51.400
into the mailbag tonight and I said

02:22:51.400 --> 02:22:53.400
sure! Why not?

02:22:53.400 --> 02:22:55.400
I'll get my hands dirty. The price?

02:22:55.400 --> 02:22:57.400
Why didn't KZDM?

02:22:57.400 --> 02:22:59.400
Alright.

02:22:59.400 --> 02:23:01.400
Let's go to

02:23:01.400 --> 02:23:03.400
Redertainment who sends us our first email tonight.

02:23:03.400 --> 02:23:05.400
Greetings podcrafters!

02:23:05.400 --> 02:23:07.400
Over the past couple days I've experienced a

02:23:07.400 --> 02:23:09.400
problem playing Assassin's Creed 3 on

02:23:09.400 --> 02:23:11.400
the 360. When I turn on my 360

02:23:11.400 --> 02:23:13.400
to play the game, I see

02:23:13.400 --> 02:23:15.400
a screen saying open tray

02:23:15.400 --> 02:23:17.400
where I should be seeing the screen where

02:23:17.400 --> 02:23:19.400
play game screen usually appears.

02:23:19.400 --> 02:23:21.400
It takes a couple times of me opening

02:23:21.400 --> 02:23:23.400
and closing the 360 DVD tray to get

02:23:23.400 --> 02:23:25.400
the play Assassin's Creed 3 screen to come up.

02:23:25.400 --> 02:23:27.400
I do not believe this is a problem

02:23:27.400 --> 02:23:29.400
with the DVD drive as other games

02:23:29.400 --> 02:23:31.400
WWE 13, Dragon Age Origins

02:23:31.400 --> 02:23:33.400
Rockstar Table Tennis appear as normal.

02:23:33.400 --> 02:23:35.400
Neither do I experience

02:23:35.400 --> 02:23:37.400
this issue with any other DVDs or

02:23:37.400 --> 02:23:39.400
CDs I've put into the DVD drive recently.

02:23:39.400 --> 02:23:41.400
Only Assassin's Creed 3 on

02:23:41.400 --> 02:23:43.400
Xbox 360 has given me this problem.

02:23:43.400 --> 02:23:45.400
My 360 is unmodded so that's not

02:23:45.400 --> 02:23:47.400
the problem. Also the Assassin's Creed

02:23:47.400 --> 02:23:49.400
3 game disc does not appear to be

02:23:49.400 --> 02:23:51.400
broken, scratched, warped, chipped or otherwise

02:23:51.400 --> 02:23:53.400
damaged. I've tried searching around

02:23:53.400 --> 02:23:55.400
online and can't find anyone else experiencing

02:23:55.400 --> 02:23:57.400
this problem. Or at least no one

02:23:57.400 --> 02:23:59.400
online is bitching about this problem.

02:23:59.400 --> 02:24:01.400
Am I an anomaly or is

02:24:01.400 --> 02:24:03.400
anyone else experiencing this problem

02:24:03.400 --> 02:24:05.400
with Assassin's Creed 3 on the 360?

02:24:05.400 --> 02:24:07.400
Stay black, Redertainment.

02:24:07.400 --> 02:24:09.400
Have you tried turning it off and

02:24:09.400 --> 02:24:11.400
back on again? Sorry.

02:24:11.400 --> 02:24:13.400
I would say if you're still having

02:24:13.400 --> 02:24:15.400
trouble doing that maybe try launching it

02:24:15.400 --> 02:24:17.400
from one of the quick launch menus.

02:24:17.400 --> 02:24:19.400
Or hit the guide button. You can launch games

02:24:19.400 --> 02:24:21.400
I think through that as well. But the quick launch menu

02:24:21.400 --> 02:24:23.400
will allow you to launch it as well.

02:24:23.400 --> 02:24:25.400
I have actually had this problem

02:24:25.400 --> 02:24:27.400
happen. And not on Assassin's Creed 3

02:24:27.400 --> 02:24:29.400
but another game. And

02:24:29.400 --> 02:24:31.400
there were a lot of fingerprints on

02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:33.400
the disc. Now I know you said you checked

02:24:33.400 --> 02:24:35.400
out your disc and it seems to be clean.

02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:37.400
I'm wondering if

02:24:37.400 --> 02:24:39.400
it's something where you can't see it.

02:24:39.400 --> 02:24:41.400
Disc rot.

02:24:41.400 --> 02:24:43.400
Well it's Assassin's Creed 3.

02:24:43.400 --> 02:24:45.400
I mean that just came out.

02:24:45.400 --> 02:24:47.400
I guess you never know. You never know.

02:24:47.400 --> 02:24:49.400
Hey, there were whole laser discs that had disc rot at shipping.

02:24:49.400 --> 02:24:51.400
If you have the ability to do so

02:24:51.400 --> 02:24:53.400
I would just install the game

02:24:53.400 --> 02:24:55.400
to your drive to be safe.

02:24:55.400 --> 02:24:57.400
Granted you still need the game to boot

02:24:57.400 --> 02:24:59.400
the file but I think you'll have a little more

02:24:59.400 --> 02:25:01.400
luck there. Otherwise

02:25:01.400 --> 02:25:03.400
I would clean the disc

02:25:03.400 --> 02:25:05.400
anyway. You might not

02:25:05.400 --> 02:25:07.400
be able to see it. And clearly you've already

02:25:07.400 --> 02:25:09.400
established it's not your 360.

02:25:09.400 --> 02:25:11.400
It's the disc.

02:25:11.400 --> 02:25:13.400
And I don't know an Assassin's Creed 3

02:25:13.400 --> 02:25:15.400
so it was another game. Try it in another person's

02:25:15.400 --> 02:25:17.400
system to see if it's actually the disc.

02:25:17.400 --> 02:25:19.400
I actually want to say it was Mass Effect 2.

02:25:19.400 --> 02:25:21.400
Because I bought that used.

02:25:21.400 --> 02:25:23.400
And Mass Effect 2 is fucking up all the games.

02:25:23.400 --> 02:25:25.400
Seriously.

02:25:25.400 --> 02:25:27.400
I'm pissed off at my Mass Effect 2

02:25:27.400 --> 02:25:29.400
because I have the version that it does with a launcher

02:25:29.400 --> 02:25:31.400
and now I can't use text mod at the end.

02:25:31.400 --> 02:25:33.400
Don't. Alright let's go to

02:25:33.400 --> 02:25:35.400
an email from Ramaditya

02:25:35.400 --> 02:25:37.400
from Indonesia.

02:25:37.400 --> 02:25:39.400
Hi guys it's Ramaditya from Indonesia.

02:25:39.400 --> 02:25:41.400
I don't know if you've already

02:25:41.400 --> 02:25:43.400
known about this. I believe you're familiar

02:25:43.400 --> 02:25:45.400
with an NES game called Blaster Master

02:25:45.400 --> 02:25:47.400
from Sunsoft. Oh yes.

02:25:47.400 --> 02:25:49.400
One of my all time favorites.

02:25:49.400 --> 02:25:51.400
You know what in fact now

02:25:51.400 --> 02:25:53.400
that you brought it up. See now

02:25:53.400 --> 02:25:55.400
I have to. Now I have to.

02:25:55.400 --> 02:25:57.400
You brought it up.

02:25:57.400 --> 02:25:59.400
So now I have to dig through

02:25:59.400 --> 02:26:01.400
the folder. Well good that means the song will be stuck

02:26:01.400 --> 02:26:03.400
in my head. Here you go.

02:26:05.400 --> 02:26:11.400
Much better.

02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:13.400
In fact it was one of my favorite games

02:26:13.400 --> 02:26:15.400
when I was a child. Several days ago

02:26:15.400 --> 02:26:17.400
I found out the info about

02:26:17.400 --> 02:26:19.400
the hack version of Blaster Master.

02:26:19.400 --> 02:26:21.400
The patch allows you to play

02:26:21.400 --> 02:26:23.400
eight completely different levels from the game.

02:26:23.400 --> 02:26:25.400
Because I cannot see

02:26:25.400 --> 02:26:27.400
so it's impossible to tell you how good or bad

02:26:27.400 --> 02:26:29.400
it is. But my girlfriend the one that

02:26:29.400 --> 02:26:31.400
tried the game informed me it was great.

02:26:31.400 --> 02:26:33.400
To know more about it please visit the link

02:26:33.400 --> 02:26:35.400
below and he has a link to Zofar.net

02:26:35.400 --> 02:26:37.400
which I. My first

02:26:37.400 --> 02:26:39.400
reaction was that site's still

02:26:39.400 --> 02:26:41.400
around. I remember

02:26:41.400 --> 02:26:43.400
hanging out in IRC chat rooms that

02:26:43.400 --> 02:26:45.400
Zofar was in. That was years. I was in college

02:26:45.400 --> 02:26:47.400
then okay. Last I knew Zofar

02:26:47.400 --> 02:26:49.400
was ad bombed and scary

02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:51.400
as a result to go to it. Zofar's

02:26:51.400 --> 02:26:53.400
got to be my age.

02:26:53.400 --> 02:26:55.400
At least. He's mid 30's

02:26:55.400 --> 02:26:57.400
for sure. Mr. International House of

02:26:57.400 --> 02:26:59.400
Brahms. Anyhow

02:26:59.400 --> 02:27:01.400
to know more

02:27:01.400 --> 02:27:03.400
about it please visit the link below. It has the info

02:27:03.400 --> 02:27:05.400
the game trailer and the patch itself.

02:27:05.400 --> 02:27:07.400
So hope it blasts your day.

02:27:07.400 --> 02:27:09.400
Now the link here is kind of lengthy

02:27:09.400 --> 02:27:11.400
so I'll just tell you to go to Zofar at

02:27:11.400 --> 02:27:13.400
Z-O-P-H-A-R

02:27:13.400 --> 02:27:15.400
dot net if you didn't already know. And look for

02:27:15.400 --> 02:27:17.400
Blaster Remaster.

02:27:17.400 --> 02:27:19.400
A lot of people in the emulation scene did

02:27:19.400 --> 02:27:21.400
this shit with like Mario Brothers. I

02:27:21.400 --> 02:27:23.400
can't tell you. When hacking and sprite changing

02:27:23.400 --> 02:27:25.400
when Nesticle implemented

02:27:25.400 --> 02:27:27.400
and yes that's what it was called.

02:27:27.400 --> 02:27:29.400
When Nesticle implemented the sprite changing

02:27:29.400 --> 02:27:31.400
abilities Super

02:27:31.400 --> 02:27:33.400
Penis Brothers was out within minutes.

02:27:33.400 --> 02:27:35.400
Like everybody

02:27:35.400 --> 02:27:37.400
did basic hacks to the game.

02:27:37.400 --> 02:27:39.400
But they got like more and more and more in depth

02:27:39.400 --> 02:27:41.400
and now you've got all these level changes.

02:27:41.400 --> 02:27:43.400
Did you ever remember the

02:27:43.400 --> 02:27:45.400
Metroid level

02:27:45.400 --> 02:27:47.400
editor that they made? Oh yeah.

02:27:47.400 --> 02:27:49.400
And there's actually several now

02:27:49.400 --> 02:27:51.400
whole new versions of Metroid.

02:27:51.400 --> 02:27:53.400
Classic Metroid that different layouts and

02:27:53.400 --> 02:27:55.400
everything that are really well done.

02:27:55.400 --> 02:27:57.400
Well thank you for a blast

02:27:57.400 --> 02:27:59.400
in the past. Maybe it'll be better than that

02:27:59.400 --> 02:28:01.400
Wii version they did

02:28:01.400 --> 02:28:03.400
some time ago. There you go.

02:28:03.400 --> 02:28:05.400
Ramaditya from Indonesia.

02:28:05.400 --> 02:28:07.400
I love being in an international show.

02:28:07.400 --> 02:28:09.400
Alright moving on.

02:28:09.400 --> 02:28:11.400
Let's see. Here's a cheap

02:28:11.400 --> 02:28:13.400
plug from Travis H.

02:28:13.400 --> 02:28:15.400
This is worth mentioning because it has

02:28:15.400 --> 02:28:17.400
to do with our old favorite pastime.

02:28:17.400 --> 02:28:19.400
Travis H. sent us a plug here.

02:28:19.400 --> 02:28:21.400
I will attempt the DDR

02:28:21.400 --> 02:28:23.400
marathon record again on

02:28:23.400 --> 02:28:25.400
November 23rd at 5 AM

02:28:25.400 --> 02:28:27.400
Eastern to November 24th

02:28:27.400 --> 02:28:29.400
to 9 PM Eastern. But this time

02:28:29.400 --> 02:28:31.400
on Doubles Play.

02:28:31.400 --> 02:28:33.400
He links

02:28:33.400 --> 02:28:35.400
to an event on Facebook and

02:28:35.400 --> 02:28:37.400
something called crowdrise.com

02:28:37.400 --> 02:28:39.400
slash DDR world

02:28:39.400 --> 02:28:41.400
record. So he's doing

02:28:41.400 --> 02:28:43.400
the record. Is it for charity?

02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:45.400
That's what I want to know. He's going to do it in Knoxville, Tennessee.

02:28:45.400 --> 02:28:47.400
Ah here we go.

02:28:47.400 --> 02:28:49.400
It is for charity. He raised $1000 for

02:28:49.400 --> 02:28:51.400
local charity through the event. He wants

02:28:51.400 --> 02:28:53.400
to double his results this year.

02:28:53.400 --> 02:28:55.400
Rescue ministries meals.

02:28:55.400 --> 02:28:57.400
I will be pledging two meals

02:28:57.400 --> 02:28:59.400
per one hour that I compete. Well at least

02:28:59.400 --> 02:29:01.400
it's for a good cause at the end of the day.

02:29:01.400 --> 02:29:03.400
So I'm all

02:29:03.400 --> 02:29:05.400
for everybody trying to one up each other on

02:29:05.400 --> 02:29:07.400
these marathons and Guinness Book of World Records

02:29:07.400 --> 02:29:09.400
and stuff when it's for charity. So good on you.

02:29:09.400 --> 02:29:11.400
Speaking of charity, am I not

02:29:11.400 --> 02:29:13.400
correct? Desert Bus started again

02:29:13.400 --> 02:29:15.400
this weekend. Really? Yes.

02:29:15.400 --> 02:29:17.400
Fine. Desert Bus is going. Umlaut's

02:29:17.400 --> 02:29:19.400
coming up of course. You've heard Jamie

02:29:19.400 --> 02:29:21.400
talk about that. God yes. I'm

02:29:21.400 --> 02:29:23.400
still working on badges. It's

02:29:23.400 --> 02:29:25.400
that time of year for child's play.

02:29:25.400 --> 02:29:27.400
By the way, I want to let you

02:29:27.400 --> 02:29:29.400
know that I was watching some Guinness World Records stuff.

02:29:29.400 --> 02:29:31.400
They fit 28 women into a mini.

02:29:31.400 --> 02:29:33.400
Wow.

02:29:33.400 --> 02:29:35.400
I know. I'm like why do people think that this

02:29:35.400 --> 02:29:37.400
is record worthy? Oh

02:29:37.400 --> 02:29:39.400
and the longest note on the didgeridoo was

02:29:39.400 --> 02:29:41.400
won by a 14 year old. Just saying.

02:29:41.400 --> 02:29:43.400
I miss

02:29:43.400 --> 02:29:45.400
didgeridoos.

02:29:45.400 --> 02:29:47.400
I miss techno didgeridoo.

02:29:47.400 --> 02:29:49.400
Remember that? That was a thing on OLR

02:29:49.400 --> 02:29:51.400
years ago. I wanted

02:29:51.400 --> 02:29:53.400
to bring up the didgeridoo for that.

02:29:53.400 --> 02:29:55.400
Quick charity is something

02:29:55.400 --> 02:29:57.400
that's interesting and actually the reason

02:29:57.400 --> 02:29:59.400
I mentioned that I've been out here in California for over a week

02:29:59.400 --> 02:30:01.400
and I wasn't on last week's show because my

02:30:01.400 --> 02:30:03.400
employer held a dodgeball

02:30:03.400 --> 02:30:05.400
charity tournament for

02:30:05.400 --> 02:30:07.400
it was basically a who's who of the

02:30:07.400 --> 02:30:09.400
startups and you know Silicon Valley

02:30:09.400 --> 02:30:11.400
mostly San Francisco area

02:30:11.400 --> 02:30:13.400
competitors and it was a whole hell of a lot of

02:30:13.400 --> 02:30:15.400
fun. I believe it was 60,000

02:30:15.400 --> 02:30:17.400
for local San Francisco charities.

02:30:17.400 --> 02:30:19.400
It was

02:30:19.400 --> 02:30:21.400
you know dodgeball. What experience

02:30:21.400 --> 02:30:23.400
do we have from dodgeball?

02:30:23.400 --> 02:30:25.400
The NES version that was amazing and

02:30:25.400 --> 02:30:27.400
Jim and this was

02:30:27.400 --> 02:30:29.400
there were 20 teams. It was a

02:30:29.400 --> 02:30:31.400
Neo Geo game too which was

02:30:31.400 --> 02:30:33.400
amazing. 20

02:30:33.400 --> 02:30:35.400
20 teams of

02:30:35.400 --> 02:30:37.400
across 17 businesses

02:30:37.400 --> 02:30:39.400
a whole day's worth of fun.

02:30:39.400 --> 02:30:41.400
It was amazing and even the

02:30:41.400 --> 02:30:43.400
World Dodgeball Society came out to officiate

02:30:43.400 --> 02:30:45.400
it and everything. It was a great time.

02:30:45.400 --> 02:30:47.400
Dodgeball was a fun game.

02:30:47.400 --> 02:30:49.400
That was one of my favorites growing up. Absolutely.

02:30:49.400 --> 02:30:51.400
Alright. You ready to get taken back

02:30:51.400 --> 02:30:53.400
with this inside joke?

02:31:03.400 --> 02:31:05.400
We're all dancing. I want the DDR guy to dance to that.

02:31:09.400 --> 02:31:11.400
If I'm ever a wrestler that's

02:31:11.400 --> 02:31:13.400
the music I'm coming out to.

02:31:13.400 --> 02:31:15.400
Alright. Last email tonight from

02:31:15.400 --> 02:31:17.400
Elliot B.

02:31:43.400 --> 02:31:45.400
Elliot B.

02:31:45.400 --> 02:31:47.400
I had no idea that series

02:31:47.400 --> 02:31:49.400
was 10 years old but it makes

02:31:49.400 --> 02:31:51.400
perfect sense. You know

02:31:51.400 --> 02:31:53.400
if Virtual Console on

02:31:53.400 --> 02:31:55.400
Wii U were to start making GameCube

02:31:55.400 --> 02:31:57.400
games show up which isn't outside the realm

02:31:57.400 --> 02:31:59.400
of possibility. That's very possible.

02:31:59.400 --> 02:32:01.400
Metroid Prime would sure be a

02:32:01.400 --> 02:32:03.400
prime candidate to kick things

02:32:03.400 --> 02:32:05.400
off.

02:32:09.400 --> 02:32:11.400
Elliot's regretting that he sent that email.

02:32:13.400 --> 02:32:15.400
Anyhow.

02:32:15.400 --> 02:32:17.400
That's it for

02:32:17.400 --> 02:32:19.400
emails this week. Mailbag at

02:32:19.400 --> 02:32:21.400
orangeloungeradio.com

02:32:21.400 --> 02:32:23.400
A few more stories for you guys and then

02:32:23.400 --> 02:32:25.400
the uh... Will he be having the Metroid

02:32:25.400 --> 02:32:27.400
primaries?

02:32:29.400 --> 02:32:31.400
Yeah. He's really regretting sending that email.

02:32:31.400 --> 02:32:33.400
You know we're gonna have an empty mailbag again next

02:32:33.400 --> 02:32:35.400
week and we're gonna say why isn't anybody emailing us?

02:32:35.400 --> 02:32:37.400
Oh yeah because we always tell the stupidest

02:32:37.400 --> 02:32:39.400
jokes. Alright.

02:32:39.400 --> 02:32:41.400
Let's get. Now would be an appropriate

02:32:41.400 --> 02:32:43.400
time to do the FUs of the week.

02:32:59.400 --> 02:33:01.400
FUs of the week. Dark Sakura.

02:33:01.400 --> 02:33:03.400
FU to uh...

02:33:03.400 --> 02:33:05.400
me not having a cat.

02:33:05.400 --> 02:33:07.400
I really want a cat.

02:33:07.400 --> 02:33:09.400
My husband says that we can't get a

02:33:09.400 --> 02:33:11.400
cat until we buy a house. So he better

02:33:11.400 --> 02:33:13.400
hurry up and buy me a house so I can get a cat.

02:33:13.400 --> 02:33:15.400
At the end.

02:33:17.400 --> 02:33:19.400
I don't know. I really don't have anything I

02:33:19.400 --> 02:33:21.400
can be angry about. I guess FUs

02:33:21.400 --> 02:33:23.400
of the fact that earlier this week I had to take

02:33:23.400 --> 02:33:25.400
a few days off work because my car was

02:33:25.400 --> 02:33:27.400
broken. But it doesn't matter anymore

02:33:27.400 --> 02:33:29.400
because I have a different car. So.

02:33:29.400 --> 02:33:31.400
Ha. Congrats.

02:33:31.400 --> 02:33:33.400
We're Honda buddies. Yeah. Honda.

02:33:33.400 --> 02:33:35.400
Is it a DeLorean? It's not a DeLorean.

02:33:35.400 --> 02:33:37.400
I will be happy with my

02:33:37.400 --> 02:33:39.400
Ponte Yoda.

02:33:39.400 --> 02:33:41.400
Um.

02:33:41.400 --> 02:33:43.400
FU to the utter

02:33:43.400 --> 02:33:45.400
lack of self control that I have

02:33:45.400 --> 02:33:47.400
and my credit card bill next month.

02:33:47.400 --> 02:33:49.400
But yay to those reward

02:33:49.400 --> 02:33:51.400
points. Uh.

02:33:51.400 --> 02:33:53.400
Jason. Um.

02:33:53.400 --> 02:33:55.400
FU to not

02:33:55.400 --> 02:33:57.400
having a car because we're down to one and Brian

02:33:57.400 --> 02:33:59.400
actually has to drive to work.

02:33:59.400 --> 02:34:01.400
FU to Wells Fargo for

02:34:01.400 --> 02:34:03.400
reasons that I don't really need to go into but are probably

02:34:03.400 --> 02:34:05.400
completely obvious. I can

02:34:05.400 --> 02:34:07.400
guess based on the FU. Yeah. And related

02:34:07.400 --> 02:34:09.400
to that FU did $2 keyboards and

02:34:09.400 --> 02:34:11.400
$50 computers. Those you know people

02:34:11.400 --> 02:34:13.400
places like Wells Fargo that have to buy

02:34:13.400 --> 02:34:15.400
these cheap ass little computers because everything

02:34:15.400 --> 02:34:17.400
runs in a web browser. I hate those

02:34:17.400 --> 02:34:19.400
keyboards. I don't know if it's

02:34:19.400 --> 02:34:21.400
just ingrained to me because

02:34:21.400 --> 02:34:23.400
I've always worked desk computer

02:34:23.400 --> 02:34:25.400
keyboard jobs. But holy crap

02:34:25.400 --> 02:34:27.400
you have a crappy keyboard and computers become

02:34:27.400 --> 02:34:29.400
a thing that

02:34:29.400 --> 02:34:31.400
an impossible thing.

02:34:31.400 --> 02:34:33.400
Oh man. I did not

02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:35.400
realize that that's ever something they would

02:34:35.400 --> 02:34:37.400
say to me. Um.

02:34:37.400 --> 02:34:39.400
FU to the

02:34:39.400 --> 02:34:41.400
there's this bridge

02:34:41.400 --> 02:34:43.400
near Berkeley north of the

02:34:43.400 --> 02:34:45.400
Bay Bridge. Overpass rather north of the

02:34:45.400 --> 02:34:47.400
Bay Bridge. And every time I've been

02:34:47.400 --> 02:34:49.400
out here and come up towards Sacramento there's a sign

02:34:49.400 --> 02:34:51.400
up there. Investigate 9-11.

02:34:51.400 --> 02:34:53.400
Stop the war. I get the sentiment but

02:34:53.400 --> 02:34:55.400
you're still up there. It's Berkeley.

02:34:55.400 --> 02:34:57.400
Just wow.

02:34:57.400 --> 02:34:59.400
No. It's Berkeley.

02:34:59.400 --> 02:35:01.400
And related to that FU did

02:35:01.400 --> 02:35:03.400
We love Berkeley but they bring

02:35:03.400 --> 02:35:05.400
the crazy. And that's why we love them.

02:35:05.400 --> 02:35:07.400
We need a little unpredictability in our life.

02:35:07.400 --> 02:35:09.400
And related to that FU to the

02:35:09.400 --> 02:35:11.400
Coney burned and carved into

02:35:11.400 --> 02:35:13.400
the hillside that I saw going up here.

02:35:13.400 --> 02:35:15.400
How many votes did he end up getting for president?

02:35:17.400 --> 02:35:19.400
It's a joke. Wow. What?

02:35:19.400 --> 02:35:21.400
Oh what? Was he

02:35:21.400 --> 02:35:23.400
on the Colorado ballot like I was talking about?

02:35:23.400 --> 02:35:25.400
He might have been. Did I miss something?

02:35:25.400 --> 02:35:27.400
You haven't heard that joke? I just told like

02:35:27.400 --> 02:35:29.400
the same joke that went around Twitter all day

02:35:29.400 --> 02:35:31.400
after election. With all the bumper

02:35:31.400 --> 02:35:33.400
stickers on cars how many votes

02:35:33.400 --> 02:35:35.400
did he get in the election? Wow.

02:35:35.400 --> 02:35:37.400
It's actually pretty good. Come on.

02:35:37.400 --> 02:35:39.400
FU to me for being out of the scene.

02:35:39.400 --> 02:35:41.400
Lastly

02:35:41.400 --> 02:35:43.400
FU to the Wii U for sometimes just

02:35:43.400 --> 02:35:45.400
not having button shortcuts

02:35:45.400 --> 02:35:47.400
so you have to let go of the

02:35:47.400 --> 02:35:49.400
controller tap on

02:35:49.400 --> 02:35:51.400
I just haven't built it yet.

02:35:51.400 --> 02:35:53.400
It I'm sure

02:35:53.400 --> 02:35:55.400
will be patched but it's just it feels

02:35:55.400 --> 02:35:57.400
weird. That's one of those doors that goes into a room

02:35:57.400 --> 02:35:59.400
where surprise it's nothing. I can't wait

02:35:59.400 --> 02:36:01.400
for the next five gigabyte patch so that'll

02:36:01.400 --> 02:36:03.400
laugh. Sorry you

02:36:03.400 --> 02:36:05.400
we owners that have the eight gigabyte model

02:36:05.400 --> 02:36:07.400
you're just not going to be able to have the

02:36:07.400 --> 02:36:09.400
shortcuts because it's another five gigabytes.

02:36:09.400 --> 02:36:11.400
Good enough.

02:36:11.400 --> 02:36:13.400
I still don't okay I still

02:36:13.400 --> 02:36:15.400
don't understand Miiverse. I

02:36:15.400 --> 02:36:17.400
can't just make a post to show

02:36:17.400 --> 02:36:19.400
all my friends. Do you really? I have to post

02:36:19.400 --> 02:36:21.400
in the like if I want to

02:36:21.400 --> 02:36:23.400
show my cat I've got to go to

02:36:23.400 --> 02:36:25.400
the Mass Effect 3 community and say hey

02:36:25.400 --> 02:36:27.400
Mass Effect 3 community. I just want to

02:36:27.400 --> 02:36:29.400
post a picture of my cat. Do you really

02:36:29.400 --> 02:36:31.400
want a public Nintendo operated

02:36:31.400 --> 02:36:33.400
Twitter clone though?

02:36:33.400 --> 02:36:35.400
Well well

02:36:35.400 --> 02:36:37.400
well

02:36:37.400 --> 02:36:39.400
well it

02:36:39.400 --> 02:36:41.400
offers me something that Twitter doesn't

02:36:41.400 --> 02:36:43.400
and that is hand drawn

02:36:43.400 --> 02:36:45.400
stylus messages. It sounds

02:36:45.400 --> 02:36:47.400
to me that this whole

02:36:47.400 --> 02:36:49.400
Miiverse thing is going to like kind of

02:36:49.400 --> 02:36:51.400
devolve into some sort of like game

02:36:51.400 --> 02:36:53.400
facts forum

02:36:53.400 --> 02:36:55.400
to be fair

02:36:55.400 --> 02:36:57.400
it works better than the

02:36:57.400 --> 02:36:59.400
Vita's thing which I still

02:36:59.400 --> 02:37:01.400
like I don't like you know the Vita has

02:37:01.400 --> 02:37:03.400
that whole thing like you can see like what your

02:37:03.400 --> 02:37:05.400
friends are doing and you can even comment on

02:37:05.400 --> 02:37:07.400
posts. Nobody fucking knows

02:37:07.400 --> 02:37:09.400
it's there. You probably don't even know what I'm

02:37:09.400 --> 02:37:11.400
talking about. It's under the achievements

02:37:11.400 --> 02:37:13.400
trophy screen. Like no no when you go into the

02:37:13.400 --> 02:37:15.400
games you hit the little thing that says

02:37:15.400 --> 02:37:17.400
down and it shows you the feed like so and so

02:37:17.400 --> 02:37:19.400
just got this game. So and so unlocked

02:37:19.400 --> 02:37:21.400
a trophy and you can actually like

02:37:21.400 --> 02:37:23.400
or you know whatever the PlayStation version of

02:37:23.400 --> 02:37:25.400
like is you can like

02:37:25.400 --> 02:37:27.400
posts and comment and all that

02:37:27.400 --> 02:37:29.400
shit like it was Facebook but no ain't

02:37:29.400 --> 02:37:31.400
nobody reading it

02:37:31.400 --> 02:37:33.400
because it's integrated very shitty

02:37:33.400 --> 02:37:35.400
like like I'm going to go into each

02:37:35.400 --> 02:37:37.400
individual game I own to look at the feed like

02:37:37.400 --> 02:37:39.400
that should be to Nintendo's

02:37:39.400 --> 02:37:41.400
credit at least that's the thing

02:37:41.400 --> 02:37:43.400
that comes up when I turn my Nintendo

02:37:43.400 --> 02:37:45.400
on. I looked at some

02:37:45.400 --> 02:37:47.400
of those video game community feeds and it's

02:37:47.400 --> 02:37:49.400
can I should I get this game

02:37:49.400 --> 02:37:51.400
can somebody tell me if I should get this game

02:37:51.400 --> 02:37:53.400
should I get this game. There were a

02:37:53.400 --> 02:37:55.400
lot of really awesome

02:37:55.400 --> 02:37:57.400
drawn art like I was I was

02:37:57.400 --> 02:37:59.400
paging through Ninja Gaiden and there were a

02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:01.400
bunch of like Ninja drawings and cheap jokes

02:38:01.400 --> 02:38:03.400
that's the most detailed penis I've

02:38:03.400 --> 02:38:05.400
ever seen. Yeah

02:38:05.400 --> 02:38:07.400
Tiger Claw sent me a link saying are you

02:38:07.400 --> 02:38:09.400
sure you want this to happen and then

02:38:09.400 --> 02:38:11.400
of course you know tada

02:38:11.400 --> 02:38:13.400
it's a penis drawn on the Wii U

02:38:13.400 --> 02:38:15.400
what a shock series

02:38:15.400 --> 02:38:17.400
looks like multiple penises actually a lot

02:38:17.400 --> 02:38:19.400
that is their upside you know what

02:38:19.400 --> 02:38:21.400
that's the banner of dick it's just

02:38:21.400 --> 02:38:23.400
it's it's a drawing

02:38:23.400 --> 02:38:25.400
of an alien planet where mushrooms

02:38:25.400 --> 02:38:27.400
grow from the ceiling that's what it is

02:38:27.400 --> 02:38:29.400
there are I still call it the banner

02:38:29.400 --> 02:38:31.400
of dick there are cave

02:38:31.400 --> 02:38:33.400
formations that do this I think it's funny that it's

02:38:33.400 --> 02:38:35.400
under archery and swordplay

02:38:41.400 --> 02:38:43.400
well played Bravo

02:38:43.400 --> 02:38:45.400
does that make the TTP two hours

02:38:45.400 --> 02:38:47.400
and forty five minutes

02:38:51.400 --> 02:38:53.400
this is just one of those shows

02:38:53.400 --> 02:38:55.400
all right Bravo JD

02:38:55.400 --> 02:38:57.400
one Tiger

02:38:57.400 --> 02:38:59.400
Claw suggests maybe it is Turian

02:38:59.400 --> 02:39:01.400
genitalia I think

02:39:01.400 --> 02:39:03.400
that Turian cock looks different than that

02:39:03.400 --> 02:39:05.400
yeah that would imply that like Turians

02:39:05.400 --> 02:39:07.400
pull down their pants and it's like an octopus

02:39:07.400 --> 02:39:09.400
down there okay from those drawings that

02:39:09.400 --> 02:39:11.400
would imply that Turians have

02:39:11.400 --> 02:39:13.400
foreskins

02:39:13.400 --> 02:39:15.400
moving on and

02:39:15.400 --> 02:39:17.400
quickly

02:39:17.400 --> 02:39:19.400
Loki what do you have for us

02:39:19.400 --> 02:39:21.400
before we get we're up almost to the skype line

02:39:21.400 --> 02:39:23.400
at one eight seven seven game OLR

02:39:23.400 --> 02:39:25.400
we're on skype orange lounge radio we're

02:39:25.400 --> 02:39:27.400
almost there but not just yet I don't have banners

02:39:27.400 --> 02:39:29.400
of cocks unless that's a new game

02:39:29.400 --> 02:39:31.400
franchise that they're gonna put out get out

02:39:31.400 --> 02:39:33.400
but Ubisoft is

02:39:33.400 --> 02:39:35.400
you know they may be interested in

02:39:35.400 --> 02:39:37.400
thq's assets

02:39:37.400 --> 02:39:39.400
of course you know

02:39:39.400 --> 02:39:41.400
their boss

02:39:41.400 --> 02:39:43.400
is it Vess

02:39:43.400 --> 02:39:45.400
I'm not even gonna try to pronounce it French guy

02:39:45.400 --> 02:39:47.400
anyways

02:39:47.400 --> 02:39:49.400
anyways he basically said

02:39:49.400 --> 02:39:51.400
yeah they're always interested in good brands and

02:39:51.400 --> 02:39:53.400
you know it may be something

02:39:53.400 --> 02:39:55.400
they can consider buying some of the IP

02:39:55.400 --> 02:39:57.400
from them

02:39:57.400 --> 02:39:59.400
I think it's just all speculation that kind of go on

02:39:59.400 --> 02:40:01.400
reaching out to people saying hey you know

02:40:01.400 --> 02:40:03.400
what do you think

02:40:03.400 --> 02:40:05.400
what do you think thq's assets

02:40:05.400 --> 02:40:07.400
impact is gonna be on like you know

02:40:07.400 --> 02:40:09.400
the neo geo console or

02:40:09.400 --> 02:40:11.400
the dreamcast or something like that

02:40:11.400 --> 02:40:13.400
but you know they're just

02:40:13.400 --> 02:40:15.400
kind of reaching

02:40:15.400 --> 02:40:17.400
obviously if they struggle enough then they're gonna try to

02:40:17.400 --> 02:40:19.400
sell off IP but I think they've already

02:40:19.400 --> 02:40:21.400
sold off IP or at least stop making

02:40:21.400 --> 02:40:23.400
stuff I know they're still

02:40:23.400 --> 02:40:25.400
sitting on a bunch of those you know you draw

02:40:25.400 --> 02:40:27.400
tablets that's for sure

02:40:27.400 --> 02:40:29.400
but

02:40:29.400 --> 02:40:31.400
I don't know I think right now they've kind of

02:40:31.400 --> 02:40:33.400
limited it down to what they're gonna work

02:40:33.400 --> 02:40:35.400
with and they're gonna make some

02:40:35.400 --> 02:40:37.400
quality games based on it or at least they're gonna

02:40:37.400 --> 02:40:39.400
try and fail

02:40:39.400 --> 02:40:41.400
but we'll see

02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:43.400
I tell you one IP they're not

02:40:43.400 --> 02:40:45.400
interested in right now

02:40:45.400 --> 02:40:47.400
UFC Undisputed

02:40:47.400 --> 02:40:49.400
well that's not theirs anymore

02:40:49.400 --> 02:40:51.400
that would be EA

02:40:51.400 --> 02:40:53.400
oh

02:40:53.400 --> 02:40:55.400
well just kill that joke

02:40:55.400 --> 02:40:57.400
they aren't interested in it

02:40:57.400 --> 02:40:59.400
because EA bought it already

02:41:01.400 --> 02:41:03.400
alrighty then

02:41:03.400 --> 02:41:05.400
uh

02:41:05.400 --> 02:41:07.400
I got one more story for you guys

02:41:07.400 --> 02:41:09.400
and uh you know

02:41:09.400 --> 02:41:11.400
I know this I know

02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:13.400
that this is the reason that you guys tune in

02:41:13.400 --> 02:41:15.400
to Orange Lounge Radio is that

02:41:15.400 --> 02:41:17.400
you wanna have your news

02:41:17.400 --> 02:41:19.400
on Beyonce

02:41:19.400 --> 02:41:21.400
and I've got your Beyonce

02:41:21.400 --> 02:41:23.400
news for you right here and it has to do

02:41:23.400 --> 02:41:25.400
with that lawsuit that was going on

02:41:25.400 --> 02:41:27.400
between Beyonce and

02:41:27.400 --> 02:41:29.400
Gate 5 uh this was that

02:41:29.400 --> 02:41:31.400
whole thing about Superstar Beyonce

02:41:31.400 --> 02:41:33.400
that was gonna happen and then she backed out of the deal

02:41:33.400 --> 02:41:35.400
so uh

02:41:35.400 --> 02:41:37.400
here it is now the appeal

02:41:37.400 --> 02:41:39.400
of the judgment

02:41:39.400 --> 02:41:41.400
where Beyonce's lawyers tried

02:41:41.400 --> 02:41:43.400
to basically get it thrown out

02:41:43.400 --> 02:41:45.400
they wanted a summary judgment in April

02:41:45.400 --> 02:41:47.400
saying that Gate 5 didn't pull in the financing

02:41:47.400 --> 02:41:49.400
that appeal failed

02:41:49.400 --> 02:41:51.400
this doesn't mean Beyonce has lost

02:41:51.400 --> 02:41:53.400
but this means we're gonna get

02:41:53.400 --> 02:41:55.400
the trial of the century

02:41:55.400 --> 02:41:57.400
it's gonna go to trial and a jury

02:41:57.400 --> 02:41:59.400
will deter if they don't settle first

02:41:59.400 --> 02:42:01.400
yeah that was just like trial of the century

02:42:01.400 --> 02:42:03.400
call duty and settle

02:42:03.400 --> 02:42:05.400
where a jury will have to determine if Beyonce

02:42:05.400 --> 02:42:07.400
was within her contract to leave the project

02:42:07.400 --> 02:42:09.400
or if she broke the agreement

02:42:09.400 --> 02:42:11.400
so uh we could get a trial

02:42:11.400 --> 02:42:13.400
out of this that would be kinda fun

02:42:13.400 --> 02:42:15.400
yeah it'll settle you know it'll settle

02:42:17.400 --> 02:42:19.400
but all I gotta say

02:42:19.400 --> 02:42:21.400
is man two keytars

02:42:21.400 --> 02:42:23.400
that's just fancy

02:42:23.400 --> 02:42:25.400
here's the thing we're looking at this little picture

02:42:25.400 --> 02:42:27.400
of Beyonce doing her little sachet

02:42:27.400 --> 02:42:29.400
like her one keyboard girl's really into it over here

02:42:29.400 --> 02:42:31.400
but look at this one

02:42:31.400 --> 02:42:33.400
this one that looks like Juliette Lewis with blonde hair

02:42:33.400 --> 02:42:35.400
she looks like the chick

02:42:35.400 --> 02:42:37.400
from Mean Girls or whatever

02:42:37.400 --> 02:42:39.400
oh no no not Mean Girls

02:42:39.400 --> 02:42:41.400
I'm sorry she looks like the chick from Glee

02:42:41.400 --> 02:42:43.400
the one that always has the blank

02:42:43.400 --> 02:42:45.400
oh Britney why do I know that

02:42:45.400 --> 02:42:47.400
oh god you know what I can safely say

02:42:47.400 --> 02:42:49.400
I've never seen an episode of that show

02:42:49.400 --> 02:42:51.400
I am so gay

02:42:51.400 --> 02:42:53.400
and I can say that

02:42:53.400 --> 02:42:55.400
I watched part of the series

02:42:55.400 --> 02:42:57.400
the first few seasons just because

02:42:57.400 --> 02:42:59.400
it was by the guy that did Nip Tuck

02:42:59.400 --> 02:43:01.400
although that series was weird

02:43:01.400 --> 02:43:03.400
but yeah I got out of it after about

02:43:03.400 --> 02:43:05.400
I think it's a couple scenes

02:43:05.400 --> 02:43:07.400
I have seen one episode of Nip Tuck

02:43:07.400 --> 02:43:09.400
that's where they put all the liposuction fat in the woman's car

02:43:09.400 --> 02:43:11.400
that's the only episode I've seen

02:43:11.400 --> 02:43:13.400
American Horror Story is much better

02:43:13.400 --> 02:43:15.400
it's messed up

02:43:15.400 --> 02:43:17.400
yeah it's also him

02:43:17.400 --> 02:43:19.400
if you like the FX show

02:43:19.400 --> 02:43:21.400
you'll like American Horror Story

02:43:21.400 --> 02:43:23.400
which is also an FX show

02:43:23.400 --> 02:43:25.400
alright

02:43:25.400 --> 02:43:27.400
they're on season 2 even

02:43:27.400 --> 02:43:29.400
yes so after all that

02:43:29.400 --> 02:43:31.400
Beyonce and Glee news

02:43:31.400 --> 02:43:33.400
we can finally go back to video games

02:43:33.400 --> 02:43:35.400
and your phone calls

02:43:35.400 --> 02:43:37.400
Skype line is open right now

02:43:37.400 --> 02:43:39.400
1877

02:43:39.400 --> 02:43:41.400
game

02:43:41.400 --> 02:43:43.400
or our username on Skype

02:43:43.400 --> 02:43:45.400
is Orange Launch Radio

02:43:45.400 --> 02:43:47.400
all one word

02:43:47.400 --> 02:43:49.400
I'll get to the twitter topics here in just a moment

02:43:49.400 --> 02:43:51.400
but I thought I'd check in with Loki first

02:43:52.400 --> 02:43:54.400
yeah this is kind of weird I guess

02:43:54.400 --> 02:43:56.400
so Nintendo for your Nintendo ID if you're a minor

02:43:56.400 --> 02:43:58.400
requires a credit card verification

02:43:58.400 --> 02:44:00.400
that's going to cost you 50 cents

02:44:00.400 --> 02:44:02.400
so which leads to the question

02:44:02.400 --> 02:44:04.400
why don't you just say you're an adult

02:44:04.400 --> 02:44:06.400
if you're a minor

02:44:06.400 --> 02:44:08.400
save the fee and the hassle

02:44:08.400 --> 02:44:11.400
which I'm sure most people will probably do

02:44:11.400 --> 02:44:13.400
I wonder if that's a permanent thing

02:44:13.400 --> 02:44:15.400
because stuff like that is usually

02:44:15.400 --> 02:44:18.400
because Loki Reggie doesn't like liars

02:44:18.400 --> 02:44:20.400
oh yeah I'm sure

02:44:20.400 --> 02:44:22.400
all those kids too are very

02:44:22.400 --> 02:44:24.400
you know they're very truthful

02:44:24.400 --> 02:44:26.400
when it comes to those age gated videos as well

02:44:26.400 --> 02:44:28.400
I'm sure no one says that they were born in like

02:44:28.400 --> 02:44:30.400
the current date

02:44:30.400 --> 02:44:32.400
or was it 1900

02:44:32.400 --> 02:44:34.400
or something like that

02:44:34.400 --> 02:44:36.400
when you go to xtube.com

02:44:36.400 --> 02:44:38.400
sure I was January 1st 1900

02:44:38.400 --> 02:44:40.400
yeah exactly

02:44:40.400 --> 02:44:42.400
hey we gotta call on the line

02:44:42.400 --> 02:44:44.400
Orange Lounge Radio who's this

02:44:44.400 --> 02:44:46.400
Ron was back again

02:44:46.400 --> 02:44:48.400
you again gotta go have a nice day

02:44:48.400 --> 02:44:50.400
what's up buddy

02:44:50.400 --> 02:44:52.400
not much um

02:44:52.400 --> 02:44:54.400
you did bring Reggie to OLR

02:44:54.400 --> 02:44:56.400
and ask him a really

02:44:56.400 --> 02:44:58.400
dumb question and I mean that in like

02:44:58.400 --> 02:45:00.400
a showgirls is dumb but I love it kind of way

02:45:02.400 --> 02:45:04.400
so what's up buddy

02:45:04.400 --> 02:45:06.400
something interesting

02:45:06.400 --> 02:45:08.400
that happened with GameStop

02:45:08.400 --> 02:45:10.400
and now with their current set of preorders

02:45:10.400 --> 02:45:12.400
it seems that

02:45:12.400 --> 02:45:14.400
my brother he went to preorder

02:45:14.400 --> 02:45:16.400
his Wii paid off in full

02:45:16.400 --> 02:45:18.400
he was going to have issues

02:45:18.400 --> 02:45:20.400
picking it up because of work

02:45:20.400 --> 02:45:22.400
and the store that's open

02:45:22.400 --> 02:45:24.400
and the whole 48 hours thing

02:45:24.400 --> 02:45:26.400
he was pretty much

02:45:26.400 --> 02:45:28.400
told more or less that if he doesn't

02:45:28.400 --> 02:45:30.400
pick it up in 48 hours

02:45:30.400 --> 02:45:32.400
they're going to give it to somebody else

02:45:34.400 --> 02:45:36.400
now it seems that

02:45:36.400 --> 02:45:38.400
due to an issue with the

02:45:38.400 --> 02:45:40.400
release of Assassin's Creed

02:45:40.400 --> 02:45:42.400
it doesn't matter if

02:45:42.400 --> 02:45:44.400
you preorder your game

02:45:44.400 --> 02:45:46.400
or console and not paid in full or not

02:45:46.400 --> 02:45:48.400
if somebody wants it

02:45:48.400 --> 02:45:50.400
they can have it

02:45:50.400 --> 02:45:52.400
well wait a minute he paid for it

02:45:52.400 --> 02:45:54.400
in full already yes

02:45:54.400 --> 02:45:56.400
but they're still threatening to give it away

02:45:56.400 --> 02:45:58.400
isn't that give it away but

02:45:58.400 --> 02:46:00.400
when he

02:46:00.400 --> 02:46:02.400
can pick it up or whatever he'll get the

02:46:02.400 --> 02:46:04.400
next one for like they're not

02:46:04.400 --> 02:46:06.400
taking away his money right

02:46:06.400 --> 02:46:08.400
no but the thing is

02:46:08.400 --> 02:46:10.400
that

02:46:10.400 --> 02:46:12.400
GameStop has now what's called no

02:46:12.400 --> 02:46:14.400
person left behind

02:46:14.400 --> 02:46:16.400
so that guarantees

02:46:16.400 --> 02:46:18.400
even if you preorder it paid for it in

02:46:18.400 --> 02:46:20.400
full if it's the last copy you're

02:46:20.400 --> 02:46:22.400
coming to pick it up if someone beat

02:46:22.400 --> 02:46:24.400
you by 10 minutes even though that's

02:46:24.400 --> 02:46:26.400
your copy that

02:46:26.400 --> 02:46:28.400
other person can walk out the store with it and you'll

02:46:28.400 --> 02:46:30.400
have to wait till the next shipment and depending

02:46:30.400 --> 02:46:32.400
on the game don't

02:46:32.400 --> 02:46:34.400
know when it's coming then why are you

02:46:34.400 --> 02:46:36.400
preordering

02:46:36.400 --> 02:46:38.400
that's my point exactly

02:46:38.400 --> 02:46:40.400
well yeah I mean I've never

02:46:40.400 --> 02:46:42.400
been a big fan of the preorder system at all

02:46:42.400 --> 02:46:44.400
I can't think of the last thing I preordered

02:46:44.400 --> 02:46:46.400
and that's how I voice my

02:46:46.400 --> 02:46:48.400
opinion I don't participate you didn't

02:46:48.400 --> 02:46:50.400
preorder a Wii U I did not preorder a

02:46:50.400 --> 02:46:52.400
Wii U I'm not sitting here going

02:46:52.400 --> 02:46:54.400
nanny nanny poo poo I found one anyway

02:46:54.400 --> 02:46:56.400
but I did find

02:46:56.400 --> 02:46:58.400
one anyway

02:46:58.400 --> 02:47:00.400
you know like it

02:47:00.400 --> 02:47:02.400
could happen now you probably couldn't do it

02:47:02.400 --> 02:47:04.400
now now that the day is over I don't think you're gonna find

02:47:04.400 --> 02:47:06.400
one but they're

02:47:06.400 --> 02:47:08.400
supposedly putting them out

02:47:08.400 --> 02:47:10.400
more frequently but okay

02:47:10.400 --> 02:47:12.400
I gotta go back to this so why

02:47:12.400 --> 02:47:14.400
couldn't your friend get there within

02:47:14.400 --> 02:47:16.400
48 hours?

02:47:16.400 --> 02:47:18.400
my bro my brother sorry your brother

02:47:18.400 --> 02:47:20.400
yeah his work schedule he

02:47:20.400 --> 02:47:22.400
the game stopped he was able to pick it up but

02:47:22.400 --> 02:47:24.400
today they will open

02:47:24.400 --> 02:47:26.400
from 11 to 6 he works

02:47:26.400 --> 02:47:28.400
11 to 7 and he's a 45

02:47:28.400 --> 02:47:30.400
minute drive away

02:47:30.400 --> 02:47:32.400
oh okay alright that makes

02:47:32.400 --> 02:47:34.400
sense and especially with all the shenanigans

02:47:34.400 --> 02:47:36.400
that have happened out there back east

02:47:36.400 --> 02:47:38.400
I mean I'm sure they're still cleaning up some of the roads

02:47:38.400 --> 02:47:40.400
oh

02:47:40.400 --> 02:47:42.400
don't get me started about that

02:47:42.400 --> 02:47:44.400
are they still rationing the gas and all that shit?

02:47:44.400 --> 02:47:46.400
um and New York

02:47:46.400 --> 02:47:48.400
City I think they still

02:47:48.400 --> 02:47:50.400
are wow I'll have to double

02:47:50.400 --> 02:47:52.400
check with that wow anyway

02:47:52.400 --> 02:47:54.400
sorry didn't mean to change the topic on you

02:47:54.400 --> 02:47:56.400
but um I do I

02:47:56.400 --> 02:47:58.400
do feel like this isn't the first

02:47:58.400 --> 02:48:00.400
I've heard of this policy I do

02:48:00.400 --> 02:48:02.400
want to say GameStop has kind of done this before

02:48:02.400 --> 02:48:04.400
where it's like well if you don't show up to get your stuff

02:48:04.400 --> 02:48:06.400
we are going to give it to a customer

02:48:06.400 --> 02:48:08.400
who's willing to you know show up and pay for it

02:48:08.400 --> 02:48:10.400
I'm not saying it makes a right

02:48:10.400 --> 02:48:12.400
I'm just saying I don't think this is necessarily

02:48:12.400 --> 02:48:14.400
news

02:48:14.400 --> 02:48:16.400
but when we're talking about

02:48:16.400 --> 02:48:18.400
a $350 console that it's happening

02:48:18.400 --> 02:48:20.400
with it does sting a hell of a

02:48:20.400 --> 02:48:22.400
lot more than some $40

02:48:22.400 --> 02:48:24.400
game exactly

02:48:24.400 --> 02:48:26.400
stop shopping at GameStop I'm sorry

02:48:26.400 --> 02:48:28.400
it had to be said you know well

02:48:28.400 --> 02:48:30.400
absolutely correct this is why I shop at

02:48:30.400 --> 02:48:32.400
Best Buy they give you at least two weeks to pick up

02:48:32.400 --> 02:48:34.400
your stuff or

02:48:34.400 --> 02:48:36.400
shit Walmart had that whole layaway

02:48:36.400 --> 02:48:38.400
thing where you'd have till Christmas day to come

02:48:38.400 --> 02:48:40.400
get it so you know

02:48:40.400 --> 02:48:42.400
you got to look at the other options

02:48:42.400 --> 02:48:44.400
exactly or targets where

02:48:44.400 --> 02:48:46.400
I lucked out today did I talk

02:48:46.400 --> 02:48:48.400
about that during the top of the show I used the target

02:48:48.400 --> 02:48:50.400
app on iPhone to see because you can

02:48:50.400 --> 02:48:52.400
check inventories and I saw that there was

02:48:52.400 --> 02:48:54.400
one not my closest target

02:48:54.400 --> 02:48:56.400
but the second closest one had had him in stock

02:48:56.400 --> 02:48:58.400
now

02:48:58.400 --> 02:49:00.400
I was discussing more

02:49:00.400 --> 02:49:02.400
and that's because the argument with another person that

02:49:02.400 --> 02:49:04.400
works at GameStop I said look

02:49:04.400 --> 02:49:06.400
if I paid for my

02:49:06.400 --> 02:49:08.400
Wii U in full

02:49:08.400 --> 02:49:10.400
and when I get there

02:49:10.400 --> 02:49:12.400
it's not there

02:49:12.400 --> 02:49:14.400
that's theft

02:49:14.400 --> 02:49:16.400
me personally at that point I

02:49:16.400 --> 02:49:18.400
would want a full refund of what I paid

02:49:18.400 --> 02:49:20.400
and I'm going somewhere else to pick up my console

02:49:20.400 --> 02:49:22.400
now this other person is arguing

02:49:22.400 --> 02:49:24.400
it's not theft because you're still going to get it

02:49:24.400 --> 02:49:26.400
I'm like yes it is since you

02:49:26.400 --> 02:49:28.400
pretty much guaranteed me

02:49:28.400 --> 02:49:30.400
that last one belongs to me

02:49:30.400 --> 02:49:32.400
and not nobody else

02:49:32.400 --> 02:49:34.400
I think that's

02:49:34.400 --> 02:49:36.400
rough

02:49:36.400 --> 02:49:38.400
I can't make

02:49:38.400 --> 02:49:40.400
a fairness claim because it's not

02:49:40.400 --> 02:49:42.400
fair to anyone

02:49:42.400 --> 02:49:44.400
it's nice that they will be willing to give

02:49:44.400 --> 02:49:46.400
it up eventually

02:49:46.400 --> 02:49:48.400
that they have

02:49:48.400 --> 02:49:50.400
a window

02:49:50.400 --> 02:49:52.400
I'm talking primarily Wii U right now

02:49:52.400 --> 02:49:54.400
you said 48 hours

02:49:54.400 --> 02:49:56.400
but it doesn't really cover what you were talking about

02:49:56.400 --> 02:49:58.400
with Assassin's Creed 3

02:49:58.400 --> 02:50:00.400
what I mean to say was because of

02:50:00.400 --> 02:50:02.400
what happened with Assassin's Creed 3

02:50:02.400 --> 02:50:04.400
people who pre-ordered didn't

02:50:04.400 --> 02:50:06.400
get it because they went to other people

02:50:06.400 --> 02:50:08.400
so an email came from corporate from that

02:50:08.400 --> 02:50:10.400
no person left behind

02:50:10.400 --> 02:50:12.400
doesn't matter about the 40 hour rule

02:50:12.400 --> 02:50:14.400
it's no longer in effect

02:50:14.400 --> 02:50:16.400
even though there's still some stores that are still doing it

02:50:16.400 --> 02:50:18.400
let me go to a comment in our chat room

02:50:18.400 --> 02:50:20.400
at live.vognetwork.com

02:50:20.400 --> 02:50:22.400
Dungeon Buster says that 48 hours thing

02:50:22.400 --> 02:50:24.400
has been with GameStop forever

02:50:24.400 --> 02:50:26.400
particularly with products in demand

02:50:26.400 --> 02:50:28.400
they'll promise the moon for pre-orders

02:50:28.400 --> 02:50:30.400
but the inside policy is to move inventory

02:50:30.400 --> 02:50:32.400
yeah that's exactly what it is

02:50:32.400 --> 02:50:34.400
I get that from a business perspective

02:50:34.400 --> 02:50:36.400
like I totally get that from a business

02:50:36.400 --> 02:50:38.400
perspective but here's the question

02:50:38.400 --> 02:50:40.400
that a lot of companies don't always

02:50:40.400 --> 02:50:42.400
assess properly

02:50:42.400 --> 02:50:44.400
at what customer service sacrifice

02:50:44.400 --> 02:50:46.400
are you gonna

02:50:46.400 --> 02:50:48.400
imply that

02:50:48.400 --> 02:50:50.400
business perspective it's about finding balance

02:50:50.400 --> 02:50:52.400
and GameStop's opinion

02:50:52.400 --> 02:50:54.400
obviously at the price of 50

02:50:54.400 --> 02:50:56.400
60 dollars GameStop can lose a few

02:50:56.400 --> 02:50:58.400
customers and still make a profit at the same time

02:50:58.400 --> 02:51:00.400
though they did just close 20 stores

02:51:00.400 --> 02:51:02.400
so maybe they're not in the

02:51:02.400 --> 02:51:04.400
best position to be turning people away but I

02:51:04.400 --> 02:51:06.400
don't know at the same time

02:51:06.400 --> 02:51:08.400
they pissed your brother off potentially

02:51:08.400 --> 02:51:10.400
but they would have made someone else very happy

02:51:10.400 --> 02:51:12.400
true so

02:51:12.400 --> 02:51:14.400
I'm not again I'm not saying it's right I'm just

02:51:14.400 --> 02:51:16.400
trying to weigh the different

02:51:16.400 --> 02:51:18.400
sides of it and look at the business perspective

02:51:18.400 --> 02:51:20.400
alright and you're right cause

02:51:20.400 --> 02:51:22.400
I worked retail for like 15 plus years

02:51:22.400 --> 02:51:24.400
I mean I see the business side

02:51:24.400 --> 02:51:26.400
of it I also see the customer

02:51:26.400 --> 02:51:28.400
side of things if it was me personally

02:51:28.400 --> 02:51:30.400
if I knew the person and

02:51:30.400 --> 02:51:32.400
I would do my best to hold

02:51:32.400 --> 02:51:34.400
it for them but if my manager's telling me

02:51:34.400 --> 02:51:36.400
give it to the next person I'm giving it to

02:51:36.400 --> 02:51:38.400
the next person cause between you and me my

02:51:38.400 --> 02:51:40.400
job's a little more important than what that person on the other side

02:51:40.400 --> 02:51:42.400
of the counter wants

02:51:42.400 --> 02:51:44.400
here's my thing personally this is how I would

02:51:44.400 --> 02:51:46.400
do it this is how I would do it is that

02:51:46.400 --> 02:51:48.400
and I'm not GameStop but if I

02:51:48.400 --> 02:51:50.400
I think the balance would be if that customer

02:51:50.400 --> 02:51:52.400
calls within the first 48

02:51:52.400 --> 02:51:54.400
hours and says hey

02:51:54.400 --> 02:51:56.400
I want to come get my system but I

02:51:56.400 --> 02:51:58.400
can't can I have an extension and

02:51:58.400 --> 02:52:00.400
tell such and such reasonable time

02:52:00.400 --> 02:52:02.400
reasonable being within you know

02:52:02.400 --> 02:52:04.400
another 48 hours or whatever then

02:52:04.400 --> 02:52:06.400
grant them the stinking extension

02:52:06.400 --> 02:52:08.400
but if a person no call no shows

02:52:08.400 --> 02:52:10.400
then give their shit away

02:52:10.400 --> 02:52:12.400
I think that's a fair compromise

02:52:12.400 --> 02:52:14.400
it is it is

02:52:14.400 --> 02:52:16.400
but as you can see GameStop's all about

02:52:16.400 --> 02:52:18.400
making that I mean

02:52:18.400 --> 02:52:20.400
ShameStop's all about making that

02:52:20.400 --> 02:52:22.400
green dollar buck

02:52:22.400 --> 02:52:24.400
I don't know what I'm just some schmo with a podcast

02:52:24.400 --> 02:52:26.400
I don't know what I'm talking about

02:52:26.400 --> 02:52:28.400
I know right

02:52:28.400 --> 02:52:30.400
alright well we gotta let you go

02:52:30.400 --> 02:52:32.400
buddy but any quick final thoughts for us

02:52:32.400 --> 02:52:34.400

02:52:50.400 --> 02:52:52.400
ain't no one getting a Wii U if that

02:52:52.400 --> 02:52:54.400

02:52:56.400 --> 02:52:58.400
or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio

02:52:58.400 --> 02:53:00.400
all one word

02:53:00.400 --> 02:53:02.400
any other last minute stories or should I get some tweets

02:53:04.400 --> 02:53:06.400
just kind of some random stuff Tom Hardy's

02:53:06.400 --> 02:53:08.400
gonna be in the Splinter Cell movie

02:53:08.400 --> 02:53:10.400
she mentioned that during Rapid Fire

02:53:10.400 --> 02:53:12.400
oh I wasn't listening I just thought I'd mention again

02:53:12.400 --> 02:53:14.400
Tom Hardy's awesome although I haven't yet

02:53:14.400 --> 02:53:16.400
to see the last Batman movie

02:53:16.400 --> 02:53:18.400
so me too I really mean to

02:53:18.400 --> 02:53:20.400
or Avengers

02:53:20.400 --> 02:53:22.400
the last I think I said this on the show already

02:53:22.400 --> 02:53:24.400
the last Batman movie was great but Tom Hardy's

02:53:24.400 --> 02:53:26.400
Bane it really creeped me out how he sounded like

02:53:26.400 --> 02:53:28.400
Count Von Count or I think this

02:53:28.400 --> 02:53:30.400
was mentioned I'm going to destroy Gotham City

02:53:30.400 --> 02:53:32.400
yeah I think this was mentioned last week

02:53:32.400 --> 02:53:34.400
he sounded Belgian to me

02:53:34.400 --> 02:53:36.400
it was Alan if you've seen that

02:53:36.400 --> 02:53:38.400
YouTube video series now they have

02:53:38.400 --> 02:53:40.400
Tom Hardy reading the cans of

02:53:40.400 --> 02:53:42.400
energy drink

02:53:42.400 --> 02:53:44.400
no I haven't seen that you need to find

02:53:44.400 --> 02:53:46.400
that it's hilarious Tom Hardy

02:53:46.400 --> 02:53:48.400
is hot as hell well it's not Tom Hardy it's

02:53:48.400 --> 02:53:50.400

bit quiet

02:54:20.400 --> 02:54:22.400
at last night I was out you know

02:54:22.400 --> 02:54:24.400
just driving around saying

02:54:24.400 --> 02:54:26.400
if there was anyone you know who might

02:54:26.400 --> 02:54:28.400
have been camping you

02:54:28.400 --> 02:54:30.400
know you know out in

02:54:30.400 --> 02:54:32.400
anticipation or pre-orders

02:54:32.400 --> 02:54:34.400
anything like that and

02:54:34.400 --> 02:54:36.400
I couldn't find

02:54:36.400 --> 02:54:38.400
really anybody it's like if they

02:54:38.400 --> 02:54:40.400
were out there

02:54:40.400 --> 02:54:42.400
they're probably just

02:54:42.400 --> 02:54:44.400
parked in the cars instead of you know

02:54:44.400 --> 02:54:46.400
out in the tents or

02:54:46.400 --> 02:54:48.400
whatever you know I think a lot

02:54:48.400 --> 02:54:50.400
more stores did pre-orders this

02:54:50.400 --> 02:54:52.400
time which was very different from last time

02:54:52.400 --> 02:54:54.400
in 2006

02:54:54.400 --> 02:54:56.400
I remember because we drove around and

02:54:56.400 --> 02:54:58.400
looked at all the lines and we participated

02:54:58.400 --> 02:55:00.400
in a line at Target and there was

02:55:00.400 --> 02:55:02.400
a line at Walmart there was a line at

02:55:02.400 --> 02:55:04.400
Best Buy there was a line at Toys

02:55:04.400 --> 02:55:06.400
Us there was a line at Circuit City

02:55:06.400 --> 02:55:08.400
well we all know why there wasn't a line

02:55:08.400 --> 02:55:10.400
there this year but

02:55:10.400 --> 02:55:12.400
some of these other stores I named all with the

02:55:12.400 --> 02:55:14.400
exception of Target they all did pre-orders

02:55:14.400 --> 02:55:16.400
they didn't do them six years ago

02:55:16.400 --> 02:55:18.400
but they do them now Best Buy did pre-orders

02:55:18.400 --> 02:55:20.400
Walmart did pre-orders

02:55:20.400 --> 02:55:22.400
Target did not do pre-orders

02:55:22.400 --> 02:55:24.400
so if you were going to find a line that was probably the

02:55:24.400 --> 02:55:26.400
place to be but I think

02:55:26.400 --> 02:55:28.400
most people that were really

02:55:28.400 --> 02:55:30.400
that rabbit about it probably got their

02:55:30.400 --> 02:55:32.400
pre-order but I sure

02:55:32.400 --> 02:55:34.400
did see some interesting tweets

02:55:34.400 --> 02:55:36.400
and I you know again it's Twitter so take it with a

02:55:36.400 --> 02:55:38.400
grain of salt but I saw somebody on Twitter

02:55:38.400 --> 02:55:40.400
who said there was a line at Walmart

02:55:40.400 --> 02:55:42.400
and the third person in line

02:55:42.400 --> 02:55:44.400
bought all the remaining

02:55:44.400 --> 02:55:46.400
we use and pissed everybody else

02:55:46.400 --> 02:55:48.400
off in line because you know she was going to flip

02:55:48.400 --> 02:55:50.400
them on eBay and actually

02:55:50.400 --> 02:55:52.400
the clerk I had at Target

02:55:52.400 --> 02:55:54.400
today said somebody tried to come in and do

02:55:54.400 --> 02:55:56.400
the same thing and they said no because

02:55:56.400 --> 02:55:58.400
they had a policy on these items to sell

02:55:58.400 --> 02:56:00.400
only one and I said good because

02:56:00.400 --> 02:56:02.400
you know those are just going to end up on eBay and he's like

02:56:02.400 --> 02:56:04.400
yeah I can't he's like I don't

02:56:04.400 --> 02:56:06.400
those they need to do something about those eBay flippers

02:56:06.400 --> 02:56:08.400
I'm like hell yeah they do so

02:56:08.400 --> 02:56:10.400
anyway sorry I got a little tangenty

02:56:10.400 --> 02:56:12.400
but so you didn't find any lines

02:56:12.400 --> 02:56:14.400
yeah

02:56:14.400 --> 02:56:16.400
yeah I mean I was looking for

02:56:16.400 --> 02:56:18.400
campers you know late at night you know just

02:56:18.400 --> 02:56:20.400
waiting it's like

02:56:20.400 --> 02:56:22.400
like where is everybody they all

02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:24.400
went to New York City I thought this was

02:56:24.400 --> 02:56:26.400
a big deal

02:56:26.400 --> 02:56:28.400
and

02:56:28.400 --> 02:56:30.400
I'm getting a text message correcting

02:56:30.400 --> 02:56:32.400
me from somebody listening right now

02:56:32.400 --> 02:56:34.400
but they did do pre-orders

02:56:34.400 --> 02:56:36.400
at Target okay

02:56:36.400 --> 02:56:38.400
well shit they didn't do enough then

02:56:38.400 --> 02:56:40.400
I didn't realize they did apparently not to sell

02:56:40.400 --> 02:56:42.400
out their first run stock yeah that's that's

02:56:42.400 --> 02:56:44.400
weird they must have done them real late in the game because

02:56:44.400 --> 02:56:46.400
I didn't see anything on the website or nothing but alright

02:56:46.400 --> 02:56:48.400
I'll take his word for

02:56:48.400 --> 02:56:50.400
it maybe

02:56:50.400 --> 02:56:52.400
they didn't all do it too could have been certain

02:56:52.400 --> 02:56:54.400
ones but anyway

02:56:54.400 --> 02:56:56.400
maybe the time to have seen the line

02:56:56.400 --> 02:56:58.400
would have been earlier today I don't know

02:56:58.400 --> 02:57:00.400
but yeah it's kind of a bummer

02:57:00.400 --> 02:57:02.400
the line thing didn't happen because there was a lot

02:57:02.400 --> 02:57:04.400
of community that came with it like

02:57:04.400 --> 02:57:06.400
Jamie I know you had a real fun time you know

02:57:06.400 --> 02:57:08.400
well I don't know about like real fun but you had a

02:57:08.400 --> 02:57:10.400
well enough time in the line

02:57:10.400 --> 02:57:12.400
just kind of talking to people right yeah but it

02:57:12.400 --> 02:57:14.400
did get kind of boring yeah

02:57:14.400 --> 02:57:16.400
and then it got really sleepy at four

02:57:16.400 --> 02:57:18.400
in the morning it starts to get old

02:57:18.400 --> 02:57:20.400
oh and then there was the woman who showed up like after all of

02:57:20.400 --> 02:57:22.400
us everyone who waited got a

02:57:22.400 --> 02:57:24.400
wee the one woman who just showed

02:57:24.400 --> 02:57:26.400
up at five in the morning no

02:57:26.400 --> 02:57:28.400
aww five in the morning

02:57:28.400 --> 02:57:30.400
still really early I walked in there at

02:57:30.400 --> 02:57:32.400
ten thirty and got a Wii U today

02:57:32.400 --> 02:57:34.400
alright Amiga enough about us

02:57:34.400 --> 02:57:36.400
how about you you went around and

02:57:36.400 --> 02:57:38.400
looked at all these lines is the Wii U

02:57:38.400 --> 02:57:40.400
something you were interested in picking up

02:57:40.400 --> 02:57:42.400
or no

02:57:42.400 --> 02:57:44.400
kind of sorta you know just

02:57:44.400 --> 02:57:46.400
really curious you know just

02:57:46.400 --> 02:57:48.400
you know it's a new new system

02:57:48.400 --> 02:57:50.400
from Nintendo and

02:57:50.400 --> 02:57:52.400
I was just hearing a lot about it

02:57:52.400 --> 02:57:54.400
currently

02:57:54.400 --> 02:57:56.400
you know don't quite have the

02:57:56.400 --> 02:57:58.400
funds to get one of my own

02:57:58.400 --> 02:58:00.400
at this time but you know

02:58:00.400 --> 02:58:02.400
I was

02:58:02.400 --> 02:58:04.400
taking with all the

02:58:04.400 --> 02:58:06.400
hype behind it you know

02:58:06.400 --> 02:58:08.400
and Reggie sees me being on

02:58:08.400 --> 02:58:10.400
Late Night with Jimmy Fallon

02:58:10.400 --> 02:58:12.400
a couple nights ago

02:58:12.400 --> 02:58:14.400
I thought

02:58:14.400 --> 02:58:16.400
I was gonna be seeing a lot of

02:58:16.400 --> 02:58:18.400
avid fans

02:58:18.400 --> 02:58:20.400
of Nintendo

02:58:20.400 --> 02:58:22.400
I guess instead

02:58:22.400 --> 02:58:24.400
I think I

02:58:24.400 --> 02:58:26.400
saw it as Nintendo just

02:58:26.400 --> 02:58:28.400
probably just planning

02:58:28.400 --> 02:58:30.400
a light launch or something

02:58:30.400 --> 02:58:32.400
like that then

02:58:32.400 --> 02:58:34.400
and I think me and maybe others

02:58:34.400 --> 02:58:36.400
might have anticipated

02:58:36.400 --> 02:58:38.400
maybe it's something that will really

02:58:38.400 --> 02:58:40.400
start to gear up through 2013

02:58:40.400 --> 02:58:42.400
oh yeah you do talk about the light launch

02:58:42.400 --> 02:58:44.400
and we don't we didn't see a lot of commercials

02:58:44.400 --> 02:58:46.400
this year either I mean there was

02:58:46.400 --> 02:58:48.400
like the occasional movie screen commercial that

02:58:48.400 --> 02:58:50.400
I caught but like there's not really

02:58:50.400 --> 02:58:52.400
been the TV commercials or that whole like

02:58:52.400 --> 02:58:54.400
what they did last time with the we

02:58:54.400 --> 02:58:56.400
would like to play I think

02:58:56.400 --> 02:58:58.400
and I heard this theory on Bobby's show

02:58:58.400 --> 02:59:00.400
and it seems

02:59:00.400 --> 02:59:02.400
perfectly reasonable to me they're just

02:59:02.400 --> 02:59:04.400
saving all that money to market them next year

02:59:04.400 --> 02:59:06.400
after Christmas makes sense to me

02:59:06.400 --> 02:59:08.400
or after Thanksgiving

02:59:08.400 --> 02:59:10.400
the bigger holiday rush either or

02:59:10.400 --> 02:59:12.400
but just why blow all the money

02:59:12.400 --> 02:59:14.400
now when all your pre-orders sold out

02:59:14.400 --> 02:59:16.400
who do you have to advertise to let the word

02:59:16.400 --> 02:59:18.400
of mouth do its thing

02:59:18.400 --> 02:59:20.400
very very true

02:59:20.400 --> 02:59:22.400
very true alright Amiga77

02:59:22.400 --> 02:59:24.400
I hope you're able to get one if you want one

02:59:24.400 --> 02:59:26.400
hopefully maybe a luck will

02:59:26.400 --> 02:59:28.400
turn around around the holidays but thanks

02:59:28.400 --> 02:59:30.400
so much for calling the show alright

02:59:30.400 --> 02:59:32.400
alright alright take care buddy

02:59:32.400 --> 02:59:34.400
yep bye bye

02:59:34.400 --> 02:59:36.400
thanks to

02:59:36.400 --> 02:59:38.400
the call I haven't heard from him in a long time

02:59:38.400 --> 02:59:40.400
appreciate hearing from some

02:59:40.400 --> 02:59:42.400
callers we don't hear from all the time

02:59:42.400 --> 02:59:44.400
Tigerclaw in chat says I haven't seen

02:59:44.400 --> 02:59:46.400
any Wii U commercials I only see a lot of

02:59:46.400 --> 02:59:48.400
commercials for that Red Dawn remake

02:59:48.400 --> 02:59:50.400
which apparently according to the

02:59:50.400 --> 02:59:52.400
commercial always got a lot of good reviews

02:59:52.400 --> 02:59:54.400
ok here's the thing

02:59:54.400 --> 02:59:56.400
there are so many movie critics

02:59:56.400 --> 02:59:58.400
that'll say good things about any

02:59:58.400 --> 03:00:00.400
fucking movie just to be in the commercial

03:00:00.400 --> 03:00:02.400
and gain their own cred believe it

03:00:02.400 --> 03:00:04.400
for the record

03:00:04.400 --> 03:00:06.400
I'm sorry Red Dawn

03:00:06.400 --> 03:00:08.400
was a movie in the 80's it was

03:00:08.400 --> 03:00:10.400
that's the only thing I have to say about that

03:00:10.400 --> 03:00:12.400
and they're remaking it because you know it's so

03:00:12.400 --> 03:00:14.400
topical I kind of want to see the sequel

03:00:14.400 --> 03:00:16.400
or the second one or the remake or whatever

03:00:16.400 --> 03:00:18.400
I kind of want to see it

03:00:18.400 --> 03:00:20.400
because it looks kind of cool

03:00:20.400 --> 03:00:22.400
I just want the scene where the girl's dead

03:00:22.400 --> 03:00:24.400
and she has the grenade on her and they find her and they

03:00:24.400 --> 03:00:26.400
blow up I'm not like you know

03:00:26.400 --> 03:00:28.400
I don't think it's going to be better than the original

03:00:28.400 --> 03:00:30.400
or anything like that it's just going to be it's just a movie

03:00:30.400 --> 03:00:32.400
whatever it's just a dumb popcorn

03:00:32.400 --> 03:00:34.400
flick exactly it is a dumb

03:00:34.400 --> 03:00:36.400
popcorn flick and

03:00:36.400 --> 03:00:38.400
there's been a lot of dumb popcorn flicks that

03:00:38.400 --> 03:00:40.400
have come out like you know dread

03:00:40.400 --> 03:00:42.400
ended up being really good so

03:00:42.400 --> 03:00:44.400
Dread was amazingly

03:00:44.400 --> 03:00:46.400
good oh man that's it's funny

03:00:46.400 --> 03:00:48.400
to say that's the last movie that I saw

03:00:48.400 --> 03:00:50.400
I've missed Avengers I've missed

03:00:50.400 --> 03:00:52.400
Prometheus I've missed I haven't seen

03:00:52.400 --> 03:00:54.400
Wreck-It Ralph yet I want to see Skyfall I want to see

03:00:54.400 --> 03:00:56.400
all of those for some reason I just don't see

03:00:56.400 --> 03:00:58.400
movies enough but I was out when I was

03:00:58.400 --> 03:01:00.400
out in New Mexico I saw Dread with some friends of mine

03:01:00.400 --> 03:01:02.400
oh man knew nothing about it

03:01:02.400 --> 03:01:04.400
going in other than Judge Dread and

03:01:04.400 --> 03:01:06.400
completely worth it I used to have the pinball table

03:01:06.400 --> 03:01:08.400
I don't know if I played

03:01:08.400 --> 03:01:10.400

any other last minute stories I still have some Twitter topics

03:01:18.400 --> 03:01:20.400
to do but yeah

03:01:20.400 --> 03:01:22.400
as we kind of mentioned a little bit

03:01:22.400 --> 03:01:24.400
your Nintendo network account

03:01:24.400 --> 03:01:26.400
is tied to your Wii U so if it

03:01:26.400 --> 03:01:28.400
breaks I guess you've

03:01:28.400 --> 03:01:30.400
ever sent it to Nintendo because I'm sure they can

03:01:30.400 --> 03:01:32.400
transfer it to a new system but

03:01:32.400 --> 03:01:34.400
if you try to go buy a new system

03:01:34.400 --> 03:01:36.400
you're fucked so

03:01:36.400 --> 03:01:38.400
just saying I'm giving

03:01:38.400 --> 03:01:40.400
Nintendo the benefit of the doubt here that they

03:01:40.400 --> 03:01:42.400
just haven't implemented that yet I hope

03:01:42.400 --> 03:01:44.400
I hope I'm thinking that it's something

03:01:44.400 --> 03:01:46.400
that a consumer can't

03:01:46.400 --> 03:01:48.400
just go buy a new system that they have

03:01:48.400 --> 03:01:50.400
to send it in Nintendo for a repair and

03:01:50.400 --> 03:01:52.400
then they can do the transfer because that's how

03:01:52.400 --> 03:01:54.400
it was with the Wii how do you get all your Wii

03:01:54.400 --> 03:01:56.400
or Wii virtual console

03:01:56.400 --> 03:01:58.400
crap transferred over that they would have to

03:01:58.400 --> 03:02:00.400
do it and then of course somebody

03:02:00.400 --> 03:02:02.400
accidentally found a way to get into the

03:02:02.400 --> 03:02:04.400
dev stuff for

03:02:04.400 --> 03:02:06.400
or the debug menu for the Wii U

03:02:06.400 --> 03:02:08.400
thing and then there

03:02:08.400 --> 03:02:10.400
was another one that someone put that somehow

03:02:10.400 --> 03:02:12.400
they got into the debug thing

03:02:12.400 --> 03:02:14.400
for the Wii U Miiverse but I think that's

03:02:14.400 --> 03:02:16.400
photoshopped so

03:02:16.400 --> 03:02:18.400
not going to say anything about that

03:02:18.400 --> 03:02:20.400
but yeah the debug menu though on the

03:02:20.400 --> 03:02:22.400
actual system I can believe that

03:02:22.400 --> 03:02:24.400
alright let me do some

03:02:24.400 --> 03:02:26.400
Twitter topics real quick Tigerclaw sent

03:02:26.400 --> 03:02:28.400
in a few he also sent in the 50 cents

03:02:28.400 --> 03:02:30.400
miners thing and the one you

03:02:30.400 --> 03:02:32.400
just talked about

03:02:32.400 --> 03:02:34.400
so I want to tip the hat to Tigerclaw

03:02:34.400 --> 03:02:36.400
because he did send one other that neither

03:02:36.400 --> 03:02:38.400
of us have hit on yet

03:02:38.400 --> 03:02:40.400
video game industry companies getting

03:02:40.400 --> 03:02:42.400
recognition in other areas

03:02:42.400 --> 03:02:44.400
the human rights campaign

03:02:44.400 --> 03:02:46.400
which champions a lot of LGBT

03:02:46.400 --> 03:02:48.400
causes which you know

03:02:48.400 --> 03:02:50.400
obviously huge huge month for

03:02:50.400 --> 03:02:52.400
them with the elections

03:02:52.400 --> 03:02:54.400
Microsoft and EA were recognized

03:02:54.400 --> 03:02:56.400
as best places to work

03:02:56.400 --> 03:02:58.400
for LGBT equality

03:02:58.400 --> 03:03:00.400
and I love that the picture

03:03:00.400 --> 03:03:02.400
on this article is

03:03:02.400 --> 03:03:04.400
Kaiden and ManShepherd

03:03:04.400 --> 03:03:06.400
from Mass Effect 3 which is a great example

03:03:06.400 --> 03:03:08.400
from EA's universe

03:03:08.400 --> 03:03:10.400
I'm telling you I don't

03:03:10.400 --> 03:03:12.400
care how it makes me sound that's

03:03:12.400 --> 03:03:14.400
the reason I played Mass Effect I was like

03:03:14.400 --> 03:03:16.400
alright I do need to play Mass Effect I got to

03:03:16.400 --> 03:03:18.400
see what this is all about

03:03:18.400 --> 03:03:20.400
I was not disappointed but there's something

03:03:20.400 --> 03:03:22.400
in it for everybody

03:03:22.400 --> 03:03:24.400
and I know Microsoft

03:03:24.400 --> 03:03:26.400
has always got kudos to this I saw

03:03:26.400 --> 03:03:28.400
there was like an official Microsoft gamer

03:03:28.400 --> 03:03:30.400
con video that they did and you know

03:03:30.400 --> 03:03:32.400
I know they've always been pretty good too with this

03:03:32.400 --> 03:03:34.400
stuff so good for them

03:03:34.400 --> 03:03:36.400
the 2013 corporate equality

03:03:36.400 --> 03:03:38.400
index is the national benchmarking tool

03:03:38.400 --> 03:03:40.400
on corporate policies this is according

03:03:40.400 --> 03:03:42.400
to the official website and

03:03:42.400 --> 03:03:44.400
EA's chief talent officer

03:03:44.400 --> 03:03:46.400
Gabriel Toledano

03:03:46.400 --> 03:03:48.400
I am very pleased that EA has scored

03:03:48.400 --> 03:03:50.400
100% rating and has been recognized by the

03:03:50.400 --> 03:03:52.400
human rights campaign in a year where the

03:03:52.400 --> 03:03:54.400
company has taken significant steps to remain

03:03:54.400 --> 03:03:56.400
inclusive EA has made changes

03:03:56.400 --> 03:03:58.400
to our medical benefits been involved

03:03:58.400 --> 03:04:00.400
in LGBT events in our community and

03:04:00.400 --> 03:04:02.400
taken a public stance against the Defense of Marriage

03:04:02.400 --> 03:04:04.400
Act EA champions diversity

03:04:04.400 --> 03:04:06.400
with a work environment where everyone feels welcome

03:04:06.400 --> 03:04:08.400
and can be themselves

03:04:08.400 --> 03:04:10.400
you know I sometimes forget

03:04:10.400 --> 03:04:12.400
that like I have Alan on my

03:04:12.400 --> 03:04:14.400
medical insurance because you know we've been together

03:04:14.400 --> 03:04:16.400
long enough that it's basically whether we're

03:04:16.400 --> 03:04:18.400
legally recognized or not it's like a

03:04:18.400 --> 03:04:20.400
common law partnership at this thing I can

03:04:20.400 --> 03:04:22.400
put him on my benefits no problem because you

03:04:22.400 --> 03:04:24.400
know I'm in California and I work for a health insurance

03:04:24.400 --> 03:04:26.400
company that recognizes that stuff I sometimes

03:04:26.400 --> 03:04:28.400
forget like not everybody's that lucky

03:04:28.400 --> 03:04:30.400
he just blows my

03:04:30.400 --> 03:04:32.400
mind

03:04:32.400 --> 03:04:34.400
I had one more last minute story please

03:04:34.400 --> 03:04:36.400
it's kind of cool it's a black ops 2

03:04:36.400 --> 03:04:38.400
easter egg in the nuketown

03:04:38.400 --> 03:04:40.400
2025 map if you shoot

03:04:40.400 --> 03:04:42.400
off all the mannequins heads on that

03:04:42.400 --> 03:04:44.400
map in under 60 seconds

03:04:44.400 --> 03:04:46.400
it unlocks an atari 2600

03:04:46.400 --> 03:04:48.400
on the TV

03:04:48.400 --> 03:04:50.400
in the game the nuketown TV the big old

03:04:50.400 --> 03:04:52.400
screen TV and you can play Activision

03:04:52.400 --> 03:04:54.400
games including hero

03:04:54.400 --> 03:04:56.400
Pitfall and

03:04:56.400 --> 03:04:58.400
Kaboom

03:04:58.400 --> 03:05:00.400
were some of the ones I did see

03:05:00.400 --> 03:05:02.400
screenshots for nice

03:05:02.400 --> 03:05:04.400
or a video

03:05:04.400 --> 03:05:06.400
couple questions and comments on Twitter

03:05:06.400 --> 03:05:08.400
from Oscar on Twitter

03:05:08.400 --> 03:05:10.400
not sold on the Wii U

03:05:10.400 --> 03:05:12.400
wait until some relevant games come out

03:05:12.400 --> 03:05:14.400
I think you're in Camp Loki over there

03:05:14.400 --> 03:05:16.400
I think Loki will be swayed if the right games

03:05:16.400 --> 03:05:18.400
come out but we ain't there yet

03:05:18.400 --> 03:05:20.400
Bayonetta 2

03:05:20.400 --> 03:05:22.400
no ways off

03:05:22.400 --> 03:05:24.400
still but I bet

03:05:24.400 --> 03:05:26.400
there's gonna be that Zelda or that

03:05:26.400 --> 03:05:28.400
you know big game is gonna be a must

03:05:28.400 --> 03:05:30.400
have next year we'll see we'll see

03:05:30.400 --> 03:05:32.400
I'm not disappointed

03:05:32.400 --> 03:05:34.400
uh Spazinator

03:05:34.400 --> 03:05:36.400
PSN tweets us

03:05:36.400 --> 03:05:38.400
random question if you three

03:05:38.400 --> 03:05:40.400
could only pick one to play

03:05:40.400 --> 03:05:42.400
which would you pick I'm

03:05:42.400 --> 03:05:44.400
gonna say you four cause he didn't know maybe

03:05:44.400 --> 03:05:46.400
that Jason was gonna be here tonight which would you pick

03:05:46.400 --> 03:05:48.400
PC gaming

03:05:48.400 --> 03:05:50.400
or console and

03:05:50.400 --> 03:05:52.400
why so you only get one

03:05:52.400 --> 03:05:54.400
or the other ever again

03:05:54.400 --> 03:05:56.400
PC gaming or console and why

03:05:56.400 --> 03:05:58.400
PC why practically everything

03:05:58.400 --> 03:06:00.400
that I want to play on the console is on the PC

03:06:00.400 --> 03:06:02.400
I can hook up a controller

03:06:02.400 --> 03:06:04.400
to the PC and play it as it was a

03:06:04.400 --> 03:06:06.400
console game plus I've got a whole bunch of other

03:06:06.400 --> 03:06:08.400
games that were made specifically for PC

03:06:08.400 --> 03:06:10.400
so it really expands my repertoire plus

03:06:10.400 --> 03:06:12.400
I have emulators

03:06:12.400 --> 03:06:14.400
for classic games

03:06:14.400 --> 03:06:16.400
so technically I could also play

03:06:16.400 --> 03:06:18.400
console games on my PC

03:06:18.400 --> 03:06:20.400
with the right emulator

03:06:20.400 --> 03:06:22.400
Loki PC because

03:06:22.400 --> 03:06:24.400
it's an open platform versus a closed

03:06:24.400 --> 03:06:26.400
platform that is on consoles

03:06:26.400 --> 03:06:28.400
and also as Jamie mentioned

03:06:28.400 --> 03:06:30.400
you can hook up a controller I mean

03:06:30.400 --> 03:06:32.400
Xbox 360 controllers pretty much work with a lot of games

03:06:32.400 --> 03:06:34.400
out there and well and it's

03:06:34.400 --> 03:06:36.400
basically just like playing on a console hell I played

03:06:36.400 --> 03:06:38.400
Crysis with an Xbox 360 controller

03:06:38.400 --> 03:06:40.400
like it was a console game and

03:06:40.400 --> 03:06:42.400
it was fine I played DC

03:06:42.400 --> 03:06:44.400
Universe with an Xbox 360 controller

03:06:44.400 --> 03:06:46.400
and it worked really well

03:06:46.400 --> 03:06:48.400
Jason

03:06:48.400 --> 03:06:50.400
Console gaming because if there were

03:06:50.400 --> 03:06:52.400
a computer I have

03:06:52.400 --> 03:06:54.400
completely admittedly

03:06:54.400 --> 03:06:56.400
the library of games I want to play would not be

03:06:56.400 --> 03:06:58.400
on the platform

03:06:58.400 --> 03:07:00.400
because I'm sure

03:07:00.400 --> 03:07:02.400
people who care will understand that

03:07:02.400 --> 03:07:04.400
I'm gonna go

03:07:04.400 --> 03:07:06.400
with PC as well and I think

03:07:06.400 --> 03:07:08.400
for most of the same reasons as Jamie

03:07:08.400 --> 03:07:10.400
it's not

03:07:10.400 --> 03:07:12.400
that I necessarily prefer

03:07:12.400 --> 03:07:14.400
PC over console I mean

03:07:14.400 --> 03:07:16.400
they have their perks but

03:07:16.400 --> 03:07:18.400
there are some games on PC that just are

03:07:18.400 --> 03:07:20.400
never gonna happen on the console like Civ

03:07:20.400 --> 03:07:22.400
Civ V not gonna happen

03:07:22.400 --> 03:07:24.400
Typing of the Dead World of Warcraft

03:07:24.400 --> 03:07:26.400
hello that's like the game I play

03:07:26.400 --> 03:07:28.400
more than anything that's

03:07:28.400 --> 03:07:30.400
you know PC only and

03:07:30.400 --> 03:07:32.400
I was gonna say

03:07:32.400 --> 03:07:34.400
the bit about emulators but she took the words out

03:07:34.400 --> 03:07:36.400
of my mouth is that most of the classics you can

03:07:36.400 --> 03:07:38.400
still get on PC whether

03:07:38.400 --> 03:07:40.400
you know Spazinator would consider that

03:07:40.400 --> 03:07:42.400
cheating or not I guess

03:07:42.400 --> 03:07:44.400
is to be seen but I would say PC

03:07:44.400 --> 03:07:46.400
gaming so

03:07:46.400 --> 03:07:48.400
alright that's it for Twitter how about

03:07:48.400 --> 03:07:50.400

try to tell us a little bit like

03:08:38.400 --> 03:08:40.400
you know I know that you are a listener of

03:08:40.400 --> 03:08:42.400
ours who is blind and I

03:08:42.400 --> 03:08:44.400
know you're very passionate about like that community

03:08:44.400 --> 03:08:46.400
with obvious reasons of course

03:08:46.400 --> 03:08:48.400
but tell us a little bit about

03:08:48.400 --> 03:08:50.400
what maybe we're not all thinking about

03:08:50.400 --> 03:08:52.400
when it comes to assessing this

03:08:52.400 --> 03:08:54.400
new platform like what

03:08:54.400 --> 03:08:56.400
accessibility features

03:08:56.400 --> 03:08:58.400
does the Wii U really need to have for it

03:08:58.400 --> 03:09:00.400
to be a console that you can sit here

03:09:00.400 --> 03:09:02.400
and say I enjoy this

03:09:02.400 --> 03:09:04.400
um well first of all

03:09:04.400 --> 03:09:06.400
good games

03:09:06.400 --> 03:09:08.400
that I care about and really

03:09:08.400 --> 03:09:10.400
as it stands right now I don't think there's a whole lot

03:09:10.400 --> 03:09:12.400
just like

03:09:12.400 --> 03:09:14.400
how like the um

03:09:14.400 --> 03:09:16.400
the Vita

03:09:16.400 --> 03:09:18.400
kind of was you know it didn't really have

03:09:18.400 --> 03:09:20.400
much starting

03:09:20.400 --> 03:09:22.400
and it's slowly getting more and more games

03:09:22.400 --> 03:09:24.400
that I care about

03:09:24.400 --> 03:09:26.400
but um

03:09:26.400 --> 03:09:28.400
what I like is I guess

03:09:28.400 --> 03:09:30.400
the tablet actually does have a headphone

03:09:30.400 --> 03:09:32.400
jack in it

03:09:32.400 --> 03:09:34.400
so um

03:09:34.400 --> 03:09:36.400
that's kind of cool um

03:09:36.400 --> 03:09:38.400
obviously

03:09:38.400 --> 03:09:40.400
um my big thing is

03:09:40.400 --> 03:09:42.400
being able to use the

03:09:42.400 --> 03:09:44.400
freaking buttons

03:09:44.400 --> 03:09:46.400
you know for the menus

03:09:46.400 --> 03:09:48.400
I honestly haven't explored that to see if that's a possibility

03:09:48.400 --> 03:09:50.400
I um I've heard that

03:09:50.400 --> 03:09:52.400
yeah you can for at least most things

03:09:52.400 --> 03:09:54.400
woohoo so that's good

03:09:54.400 --> 03:09:56.400
um I don't know if you caught my comment

03:09:56.400 --> 03:09:58.400
earlier in the show but one of the things I really

03:09:58.400 --> 03:10:00.400
love about the Wii U is the whole fact

03:10:00.400 --> 03:10:02.400
that the sound on the TV

03:10:02.400 --> 03:10:04.400
and the sound coming out

03:10:04.400 --> 03:10:06.400
of the gamepad will

03:10:06.400 --> 03:10:08.400
really compliment each other and I'm

03:10:08.400 --> 03:10:10.400
not just talking about like the incidentals like we

03:10:10.400 --> 03:10:12.400
were used to hearing with the Wii like

03:10:12.400 --> 03:10:14.400
you know the little Wii mote would make sounds

03:10:14.400 --> 03:10:16.400
once in a while but like the Wii U

03:10:16.400 --> 03:10:18.400
full on like a musical soundtrack

03:10:18.400 --> 03:10:20.400
will play out of the gamepad that compliments what's

03:10:20.400 --> 03:10:22.400
going on on the TV and it creates

03:10:22.400 --> 03:10:24.400
this sound experience that

03:10:24.400 --> 03:10:26.400
no other console really has right now

03:10:26.400 --> 03:10:28.400
I heard with Zombie U

03:10:28.400 --> 03:10:30.400
um your radio

03:10:30.400 --> 03:10:32.400
transmissions

03:10:32.400 --> 03:10:34.400
like the stuff that you're getting

03:10:34.400 --> 03:10:36.400
through you know your radio actually comes out

03:10:36.400 --> 03:10:38.400
of the tablet which is

03:10:38.400 --> 03:10:40.400
pretty neat yes and uh Batman

03:10:40.400 --> 03:10:42.400
Arkham City does something similar if you are

03:10:42.400 --> 03:10:44.400
close to the person you'll hear it from the

03:10:44.400 --> 03:10:46.400
TV if you're far away you'll hear

03:10:46.400 --> 03:10:48.400
it on the tablet oh that

03:10:48.400 --> 03:10:50.400
is cool yeah yeah yeah that's very

03:10:50.400 --> 03:10:52.400
cool um now what I'm curious about

03:10:52.400 --> 03:10:54.400
is I wonder like

03:10:54.400 --> 03:10:56.400
if

03:10:56.400 --> 03:10:58.400
all of the game audio like

03:10:58.400 --> 03:11:00.400
say if you have your

03:11:00.400 --> 03:11:02.400
TV doing

03:11:02.400 --> 03:11:04.400
something else and

03:11:04.400 --> 03:11:06.400
you're just using the controller

03:11:06.400 --> 03:11:08.400
I wonder if uh all of your game

03:11:08.400 --> 03:11:10.400
audio is going to be uh

03:11:10.400 --> 03:11:12.400
streamed as well or if it's just gonna be

03:11:12.400 --> 03:11:14.400
the incidentals that's what

03:11:14.400 --> 03:11:16.400
I'm curious about I think it depends on the game

03:11:16.400 --> 03:11:18.400
yeah I was I would have to say I would have

03:11:18.400 --> 03:11:20.400
to if I would have to take an educated guess

03:11:20.400 --> 03:11:22.400
can uh Rob was playing Mario

03:11:22.400 --> 03:11:24.400
and it was the the

03:11:24.400 --> 03:11:26.400
gamepad experience versus the TV was

03:11:26.400 --> 03:11:28.400
identical um I would

03:11:28.400 --> 03:11:30.400
assume that when headphones are in there I didn't

03:11:30.400 --> 03:11:32.400
I didn't really hear anything coming

03:11:32.400 --> 03:11:34.400
the music was not identical because they

03:11:34.400 --> 03:11:36.400
were complimenting each other but most

03:11:36.400 --> 03:11:38.400
of the sound effects see you probably couldn't hear it all

03:11:38.400 --> 03:11:40.400
the way back here because you're just hearing

03:11:40.400 --> 03:11:42.400
all the sound from the side of the room but when you're sitting

03:11:42.400 --> 03:11:44.400
right there you hear it it's really

03:11:44.400 --> 03:11:46.400
cool the two things the two things

03:11:46.400 --> 03:11:48.400
to consider really really quick with that is that one

03:11:48.400 --> 03:11:50.400
it may it may become smarter when

03:11:50.400 --> 03:11:52.400
it sees that headphones are plugged in

03:11:52.400 --> 03:11:54.400
that's what I was thinking yeah and second

03:11:54.400 --> 03:11:56.400
there are options on like when you were doing

03:11:56.400 --> 03:11:58.400
the chat there's options to shut off

03:11:58.400 --> 03:12:00.400
the TV so maybe when it knows one

03:12:00.400 --> 03:12:02.400
medium is gone it brings everything to the

03:12:02.400 --> 03:12:04.400
gamepad that's true yeah

03:12:04.400 --> 03:12:06.400
also I wanted to bring up word of caution

03:12:06.400 --> 03:12:08.400
for those that um

03:12:08.400 --> 03:12:10.400
are big fans of

03:12:10.400 --> 03:12:12.400
uh Super Smash Brothers

03:12:12.400 --> 03:12:14.400
Brawl with um

03:12:14.400 --> 03:12:16.400
particularly with the GameCube

03:12:16.400 --> 03:12:18.400
controls

03:12:18.400 --> 03:12:20.400
um don't get rid of your Wii

03:12:21.400 --> 03:12:23.400
cause Wii U doesn't have GameCube ports

03:12:23.400 --> 03:12:25.400
oh that's a very good point

03:12:25.400 --> 03:12:27.400
there are no ports

03:12:27.400 --> 03:12:29.400
and general consensus from

03:12:29.400 --> 03:12:31.400
many many people that I've seen

03:12:31.400 --> 03:12:33.400
is GameCube

03:12:33.400 --> 03:12:35.400
controllers kind of the best way to play Brawl

03:12:35.400 --> 03:12:37.400
what about the pro controller

03:12:37.400 --> 03:12:39.400
oh I guess maybe it wouldn't work

03:12:39.400 --> 03:12:41.400
that wouldn't work with Brawl though

03:12:41.400 --> 03:12:43.400
yikes

03:12:43.400 --> 03:12:45.400
they need to bring back

03:12:45.400 --> 03:12:47.400
bring back the wave bird

03:12:47.400 --> 03:12:49.400
no shit the wave bird was

03:12:49.400 --> 03:12:51.400
the only thing the wave bird was missing was rumble

03:12:51.400 --> 03:12:53.400
that would have been

03:12:53.400 --> 03:12:55.400
that would have made it perfect

03:12:55.400 --> 03:12:57.400
but that is probably

03:12:57.400 --> 03:12:59.400
one of my favorite controllers

03:12:59.400 --> 03:13:01.400
still it was a good

03:13:01.400 --> 03:13:03.400
good controller but I think it's nice

03:13:03.400 --> 03:13:05.400
and sturdy and just

03:13:05.400 --> 03:13:07.400
I have my collection of

03:13:07.400 --> 03:13:09.400
wave birds

03:13:09.400 --> 03:13:11.400
I do actually have four wave birds

03:13:11.400 --> 03:13:13.400
one of them is an E3

03:13:13.400 --> 03:13:15.400
wave bird nice

03:13:15.400 --> 03:13:17.400
that my friend sold me

03:13:17.400 --> 03:13:19.400
alright sirlock I gotta let you go so we can wrap up

03:13:19.400 --> 03:13:21.400
but any other comments before we let you go

03:13:21.400 --> 03:13:23.400
um

03:13:23.400 --> 03:13:25.400
that has nothing to do with games

03:13:25.400 --> 03:13:27.400
but um

03:13:27.400 --> 03:13:29.400
swear to god

03:13:29.400 --> 03:13:31.400
saw a I don't know if it's still there

03:13:31.400 --> 03:13:33.400
but there was

03:13:33.400 --> 03:13:35.400
a single box of

03:13:35.400 --> 03:13:37.400
Twinkies on eBay

03:13:37.400 --> 03:13:39.400
with a buy it now of ten thousand

03:13:39.400 --> 03:13:41.400
dollars I'm not kidding

03:13:41.400 --> 03:13:43.400
fucking ridiculous

03:13:43.400 --> 03:13:45.400
I know right

03:13:45.400 --> 03:13:47.400
they're gold plated

03:13:47.400 --> 03:13:49.400
you know all that shit's gonna be bought out

03:13:49.400 --> 03:13:51.400
don't

03:13:51.400 --> 03:13:53.400
we'll be fine

03:13:53.400 --> 03:13:55.400
Twinkies aren't even that good anyway

03:13:55.400 --> 03:13:57.400
shit my thing is ding dongs

03:13:57.400 --> 03:13:59.400
little Debbie's strawberry shortcakes are the bomb

03:13:59.400 --> 03:14:01.400
nutty bars

03:14:01.400 --> 03:14:03.400
nutty bars are pretty fucking good too

03:14:03.400 --> 03:14:05.400
we have two Weird Al references with hostess products

03:14:05.400 --> 03:14:07.400
ding dong man ding dong

03:14:07.400 --> 03:14:09.400
ding dong yo

03:14:09.400 --> 03:14:11.400
and

03:14:11.400 --> 03:14:13.400
the Twinkie wiener sandwich

03:14:13.400 --> 03:14:15.400
yes

03:14:15.400 --> 03:14:17.400
the only Twinkie that I accept

03:14:17.400 --> 03:14:19.400
is a deep fried Twinkie

03:14:19.400 --> 03:14:21.400
I only could eat half of one

03:14:21.400 --> 03:14:23.400
when we did those at the tourney

03:14:23.400 --> 03:14:25.400
I don't know that just sounds like

03:14:25.400 --> 03:14:27.400
a part of DDR's history in Sacramento

03:14:27.400 --> 03:14:29.400
has died

03:14:29.400 --> 03:14:31.400
because we had the only

03:14:31.400 --> 03:14:33.400
DDR tournament ever to sell

03:14:33.400 --> 03:14:35.400
deep fried Twinkies

03:14:35.400 --> 03:14:37.400
why?

03:14:37.400 --> 03:14:39.400
why the fuck not bitch

03:14:39.400 --> 03:14:41.400
distinguishing factor you have there

03:14:41.400 --> 03:14:43.400
dude in Sacramento

03:14:43.400 --> 03:14:45.400
we did it fucked up

03:14:45.400 --> 03:14:47.400
because our first tournament was

03:14:47.400 --> 03:14:49.400
scat Sacramento

03:14:49.400 --> 03:14:51.400
cosplay and tournament

03:14:51.400 --> 03:14:53.400
yes

03:14:53.400 --> 03:14:55.400
and it was

03:14:55.400 --> 03:14:57.400
great

03:14:57.400 --> 03:14:59.400
there was a NES game

03:14:59.400 --> 03:15:01.400
called scat

03:15:01.400 --> 03:15:03.400
yes there was

03:15:03.400 --> 03:15:05.400
it was a damn good game

03:15:05.400 --> 03:15:07.400
well I gotta give this call the

03:15:07.400 --> 03:15:09.400
shaft as in Sacramento hosts another fabulous

03:15:09.400 --> 03:15:11.400
tournament and say

03:15:11.400 --> 03:15:13.400
goodnight so take care of Sturlock

03:15:13.400 --> 03:15:15.400
see ya

03:15:15.400 --> 03:15:17.400
we had the best acronyms for our I mean like nobody

03:15:17.400 --> 03:15:19.400
could top that in the DRC

03:15:19.400 --> 03:15:21.400
yeah we were awesome

03:15:21.400 --> 03:15:23.400
even though everybody in the bay area hated Sacramento

03:15:23.400 --> 03:15:25.400
but nah that was mostly one or two

03:15:25.400 --> 03:15:27.400
dickhead loudmouths

03:15:27.400 --> 03:15:29.400
alright anyhow

03:15:29.400 --> 03:15:31.400
lets not dig up ten year old drama

03:15:31.400 --> 03:15:33.400
burn them bridges

03:15:33.400 --> 03:15:35.400
alright but we're here and they're somewhere else

03:15:35.400 --> 03:15:37.400

oh that's a good question

03:16:19.400 --> 03:16:21.400
it's actually kind of a hard question besides

03:16:21.400 --> 03:16:23.400
social networks I don't really care

03:16:23.400 --> 03:16:25.400

Boycott Black Friday

03:16:49.400 --> 03:16:51.400
my final thought

03:16:51.400 --> 03:16:53.400
is sounds good to me

03:16:53.400 --> 03:16:55.400

03:16:55.400 --> 03:16:57.400

03:16:57.400 --> 03:16:59.400
Boycott Black Friday if you're going to get your retail

03:16:59.400 --> 03:17:01.400
consumerism on

03:17:01.400 --> 03:17:03.400
do it on Cyber Monday buy all your stuff online

03:17:03.400 --> 03:17:05.400

03:17:07.400 --> 03:17:09.400
but do something

03:17:09.400 --> 03:17:11.400
that isn't going to give in to the whole corporate

03:17:11.400 --> 03:17:13.400
bullshit I'm sick of it let's just

03:17:13.400 --> 03:17:15.400
show them that people aren't going to

03:17:15.400 --> 03:17:17.400

03:17:19.400 --> 03:17:21.400
by being consumer horse

03:17:21.400 --> 03:17:23.400
my final thought

03:17:23.400 --> 03:17:25.400
is Jamie's going to be moving to Berkeley

03:17:25.400 --> 03:17:27.400
