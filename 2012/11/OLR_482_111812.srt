00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:39,400
Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice. It is Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:46,400
My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle with my buddies.

8
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,400
Say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,400
Hi.

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,400
Hi, how are you?

11
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,400
I'm sick of donuts.

12
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:59,400
Oh god, not the hostess thing. Were you one of those people clearing out 7-Eleven?

13
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:18,400
No, no, actually not at all. I was watching Undersedation Live last night and they were eating, well Travis was eating Ding Dongs, Twinkies, all kinds of stuff and all of a sudden I wanted donuts and this Martin Final around the corner from my house had them.

14
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:25,400
So I bought 10 of them and gave a pack to a homeless guy and the rest of them are now in my fridge at home.

15
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:36,400
So should I have the urge to eat a donut, which I really shouldn't be because wheat makes me sick, but I have them now. I ate a pack today, I wish I hadn't.

16
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:52,400
Here's the thing, I'm not going to get into the whole why about it, but I'm going to tell you why the closure pisses me off is because Hostess also makes, and I don't know if this is a nationwide thing, it might be a regional thing, but they make this bread called Columbo Bread, which is the sourdough bread that is so flipping good.

17
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,400
Columbo is its own brand.

18
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,400
Right, but it's part of Hostess.

19
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,400
I know, right, but Columbo also makes frozen yogurt.

20
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,400
Oh, okay.

21
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:07,400
Columbo also makes a bunch of other baked goods, but they also do, because it used to be a major competitor for the company that my dad used to work for.

22
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:13,400
My dad used to work for a distributor called W.J. Powell Company and they did a different bread for their supplier.

23
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,400
Columbo was one of the big southern competitors.

24
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,400
Oh, I always thought they were based out here because San Francisco is sourdough bread.

25
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,400
Yeah, but they also do other kinds of breads.

26
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
Oh, okay.

27
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:32,400
It's a national bread company and they also do frozen yogurt and other, let's see what I'm thinking of, mass distribution foods.

28
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,400
Well, my point was, I'm not going to be able to get that sourdough bread anymore, at least until somebody buys the company or whatever.

29
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,400
Well, you can go to Fucking Boudin and get good bread.

30
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,400
But I love Columbo Bread, you shut up. Alright. Also, say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

31
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,400
I completely was ignoring everything you guys were talking about for the last minute or two.

32
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,400
Hostess, you don't have an opinion on Twinkies?

33
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,400
I don't like them.

34
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,400
I think people are going way too crazy over this, but it's because everybody remembers them from a kid.

35
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:06,400
Like, I don't know about you guys, but like a Twinkie was like a staple dessert that came with your little bag lunch.

36
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,400
Holy crap, it's cake with frosting inside.

37
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,400
Wow, no one will ever be able to do that.

38
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,400
Well, Little Debbie, if you eat Little Debbie stuff, strawberry shortcakes are superior.

39
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,400
No, no, no, no. It's all about oatmeal cream pies.

40
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:31,400
I don't know if they actually had like a Hostess like end cap or whatever at our local grocery store, and now it's all Little Debbie stuff now.

41
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:38,400
They just like completely removed it all. I don't know if they have like return it all before, you know, their, you know.

42
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,400
Little Debbie was probably the one that, you know, convinced them all to join the union and all that. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I don't want to go there.

43
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:49,400
All right. Also say hello to the one, the only Jason is joining us in studio tonight.

44
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
Hello again, everybody.

45
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,400
Mr. VX Jason X V X Y Z Q R S T U P.

46
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
Yeah.

47
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,400
Hey for me.

48
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,400
How you doing?

49
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:08,400
I'm tired from zipping south of San Francisco and north of San Francisco and train for much too long as usual and you know, but I'm here. So why not?

50
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,400
And commuting back and forth from Colorado.

51
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,400
Uh huh.

52
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:21,400
Which by the way, being that you see, politics is pretty bad here because you know, it's bad everywhere, but like at least we're not a swing state.

53
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,400
Like everybody knew how California was going to vote.

54
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,400
Oh yeah.

55
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,400
Your state on the other hand. Oh my God. You must be really fucking sick of politics.

56
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,400
And this is I not watching TV.

57
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:42,400
The only exposure to politics that I had was every once in a while that Facebook either a sponsored post or you know, a friend liking something that shows up on my feed.

58
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,400
It was surprisingly minimal.

59
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,400
I didn't get too much of it and I could very easily just skim the sponsored posts.

60
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:59,400
But the one thing that I did get is YouTube partner channels. The ones that actually monetize their channel. Politic two minute political ads every single video.

61
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:07,400
And there have been a couple of gaming shows. The Continue Show, Game Grumps, and then individually John Chon and Egoraptor.

62
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,400
I've been watching a ton of their videos and they all monetize.

63
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:19,400
So the start of every episode, the end of every episode for whatever reason, even though you can just skip it, and the middle of particularly long episodes.

64
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,400
Political ad, political ad, political ad, political ad, political ad.

65
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,400
So it wasn't terribly specific for my region, but it still sucked.

66
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,400
This is why you don't see Wii U commercials anywhere because the politicians bought up all the ad space.

67
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,400
Yeah, they really did.

68
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,400
There it is.

69
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,400
I'm going to have fun trivia about politics since we're on the subject to get it out of the way.

70
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,400
So everybody knows the two candidates that were in all 50 states.

71
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,400
Most people know that there are actually six candidates that are in 47 of the states, I think.

72
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,400
Like Roseanne.

73
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,400
Correct. Roseanne Barr, Jill Stein, Gary Johnson, and I always forget the fourth guy.

74
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,400
Columbus voted for Jill Stein, by the way.

75
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
Virgil something.

76
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,400
Yeah, Virgil Goode. Virgil Goode. Somebody always remembers that name when I never do. It's the weirdest thing.

77
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,400
You know how many presidential candidates were on the Colorado ballot?

78
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,400
How many?

79
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,400
Sixteen.

80
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,400
Wow.

81
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:15,400
Yeah. I don't know if it was sarcastic, but somebody told me that the only thing you have to do to get on the ballot is to have some kind of party application.

82
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,400
You have to have some kind of a political party and pay $500.

83
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,400
Now, okay, I'm not going to ask you how you voted in elections because that's, you know, a touchy subject and whatever.

84
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,400
But also I do want to remind everybody, it is a video game show and there is the always present extra guest in our chat room.

85
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,400
Hi, everybody.

86
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,400
Duke Nukem says don't fuck with Roseanne.

87
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,400
We do tape live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network, voguesnetwork.com.

88
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,400
Six o'clock Pacific, nine o'clock Eastern, right after the Bobby Black Wolf show. It is a live experience.

89
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,400
But of course, we love the podcasties as well.

90
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,400
And he said, yeah, Duke Nukem says don't fuck with Roseanne.

91
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,400
So Duke Nukem must have been a Roseanne fan.

92
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:56,400
I'm not going to ask about the big one because, you know, that's still got a lot of, like, a lot of ruffled feathers and so forth.

93
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:04,400
But I got to know, how do you feel being in one of these states where you can get weed anywhere you want now?

94
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,400
It is legal weed.

95
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,400
Up to an ounce.

96
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,400
Up to an ounce.

97
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,400
Up to an ounce.

98
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,400
I don't, I.

99
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,400
I know you're not a smoker.

100
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,400
And to be fair, disclaimer, nobody here at OLR, like, actually smokes it.

101
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,400
But, you know, I.

102
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,400
I love brownies.

103
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,400
I find the cold.

104
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,400
I just, I.

105
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,400
That's how I found out I wasn't actually allergic to the substance.

106
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,400
I'm allergic to the smoke.

107
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,400
I actually eat all that snacky food because I'm just a fat pig.

108
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
Like, I'm not even smoking weed.

109
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,400
I'm just a fat pig.

110
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,400
But how do you feel about all that being in that state?

111
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:44,400
The best thing that's come out of this is the humor on Facebook and the local communities because of how many people I follow that live in the area go figure that the the jokes, the pictures, the memes, they are actually pretty damn funny.

112
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,400
Getting high while you are actually high in the Mile High City?

113
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,400
That's a new one to me, actually.

114
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
I just like the one of the fog rolling in.

115
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,400
Yes. Yes.

116
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,400
Suddenly in Colorado.

117
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:05,400
Well, my my my favorite as well is the whole fact that, like, it's a fucking cruel joke that hostess closes the week after they legalize marijuana in two states.

118
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:10,400
And it's like, what kind of fucking stupid business decision was that?

119
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,400
Maybe you own Twinkies.

120
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,400
You were sitting on a gold mine anyway.

121
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,400
No, they were too busy giving themselves raises and not worrying about things like benefits.

122
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
All right. All right.

123
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,400
And pensions.

124
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
Fucking greedy ass fuckers.

125
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:40,400
But since we're all look, since we're all like under the age of like 50, I'm sure we can agree that yay to those states that finally voted the right way and either legalized or stop the banning of, you know, marriage and all that.

126
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,400
So, of course.

127
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
Yay to Washington and all that.

128
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:48,400
It makes it more difficult because we have to watch out for for state officials.

129
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,400
We don't have to watch out for state officials.

130
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:59,400
But when we hear about a federal raid, then it becomes a little bit more dangerous because as the disclaimer goes, it is still illegal at the federal level, which ultimately supersedes state law.

131
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,400
All right. Anyhow, we got to get to video games.

132
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,400
It's been a busy week in video games.

133
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
We're getting too political.

134
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,400
Let's pause. Shut up.

135
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,400
Don't talk about politics.

136
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,400
I tuned in here about games.

137
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Fine. We can talk games.

138
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,400
Let's talk about Wii U, obviously.

139
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:21,400
Everybody's heard that joke, but in part to Bobby, who does the show before us every week.

140
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,400
But Big Day in Nintendo World, the Wii U launched.

141
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,400
How are we feeling about the Wii U?

142
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,400
So I teased before the show.

143
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,400
One of us did get the Wii U.

144
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,400
Jason, was it you?

145
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,400
No, I've been busy in California.

146
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,400
Dark Soccer, did you buy the Wii U?

147
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,400
I'm not a whore.

148
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,400
So that means it's between Loki and myself.

149
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,400
Now, Loki, you do work for the distribution company.

150
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,400
I do work for a distribution company.

151
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,400
And you've been shading the shit out of Nintendo on the past few episodes of the show.

152
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,400
That's true.

153
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,400
Did you have a change of heart and did you buy a Wii U?

154
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,400
No, I already own a Wii.

155
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,400
Yes, it was me. I bought the Wii U this morning.

156
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
Surprise.

157
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
I did. Yep.

158
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,400
So let's talk about the Wii U a little bit.

159
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:09,400
I guess I'll start since, you know, I actually have one.

160
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,400
No, here's the thing.

161
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,400
I went back and forth on that Wii U thing a lot.

162
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,400
I made a very cryptic tweet last night talking about...

163
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,400
Because here's the thing.

164
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,400
I chose not to go out and stand in line and all that stuff for the Wii U last night

165
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,400
because Irene, who a lot of you old school OLR listeners know,

166
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,400
she used to be on the show all the time.

167
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,400
Irene was visiting and...

168
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
I'm trying to make it sound like she doesn't live here,

169
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,400
but she came over and we went out for her birthday.

170
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,400
So I chose to go get drunk at a gay bar rather than go stand out in line.

171
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
I think I made the right decision.

172
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,400
So I pretty much convinced myself, you know what?

173
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,400
I don't need a Wii U.

174
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,400
I'm not going to get one.

175
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,400
I'm over it.

176
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,400
You know, I'll get one in January or whatever.

177
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:56,400
And then this morning, I fire up the Target app and I just look out of curiosity.

178
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,400
It's like 11 o'clock.

179
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,400
They're still in stock at the store nearby.

180
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,400
Let's just go take a look.

181
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,400
Walk out of there with my Wii U Deluxe set.

182
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,400
Not only are you a whore...

183
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,400
I found one at noon.

184
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,400
I found one at noon, still on a shelf in Target.

185
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,400
Not only are you a whore, you're a waffling whore.

186
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:16,400
So they're not sold out like the Wii.

187
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
Oh, I guess...

188
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,400
They probably are now, to be fair, because there were two left and I bought one.

189
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,400
So...

190
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,400
See, Nintendo, Apple helps you sell your stuff.

191
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,400
If you're going to pick any mobile platform, Apple.

192
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,400
I'm sure that isn't a surprise to hear me say ever.

193
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,400
So to be honest, I've only really been able to spend like 30 minutes

194
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,400
playing actual games on the console.

195
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,400
Because as I'm sure you all heard, there's that massive 5 gigabyte update.

196
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,400
And that took an hour out.

197
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,400
And you know, I had to do other stuff to prep for the show.

198
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,400
So I didn't have a whole lot of time to really sit down with the Wii U.

199
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,400
But I'm going to tell you like this.

200
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:50,400
This is the impression I got of the Wii U with the little time I had playing it.

201
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,400
You know, this isn't a reference everybody's going to get.

202
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:57,400
If you live in Northern California, you know the Winchester Mystery House.

203
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,400
Dar Sacra, for those that don't live in Northern California, please explain the Winchester Mystery House.

204
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,400
The Winchester Mystery House is in San Jose.

205
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:10,400
It was built by this lady named Sarah Winchester, who was married to the Mr. Winchester,

206
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,400
who made all the guns and killed people.

207
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,400
Well, his guns killed people.

208
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:20,400
And, well, she thought she was being haunted by the ghost of everyone who had ever died with one of the Winchester rifles.

209
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,400
So she went to a medium who said,

210
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,400
Yeah, you're being haunted, so you have to build a house to trap all the ghosts in.

211
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,400
And if you stop building, you'll die.

212
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:34,400
Well, she built a house seven stories tall, with all these rooms and construction never stopped during her life.

213
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,400
Until she died, then construction stopped.

214
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:40,400
The top three floors were knocked off during an earthquake.

215
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:44,400
And now the rest of it's been turned into sort of a tourist trap.

216
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,400
But it's a really neat house.

217
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,400
There's stairs that go into the ceiling.

218
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:52,400
She has very small doors, and because Ms. Winchester had horrible arthritis and was very short,

219
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,400
she has these little tiny steps that go in spirals all through the house.

220
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,400
There's a seance room that has, I think, seven doors in and no doors out.

221
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,400
There's a door that opens just to the outside from the second story.

222
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,400
Oops, dead.

223
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,400
There's a huge basement. People see ghosts there, all kinds of stuff.

224
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,400
So there's a reason I have Dark Sakura tell that story, because that's how I kind of feel about the Wii U,

225
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,400
is that, like, there's these doors that you'll open and there's a wall there.

226
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,400
And there'll be, like, a half-finished tunnel.

227
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:23,400
And it's like, oh, you can click on Amazon Prime, and then it's like, surprise, it's fucking nothing.

228
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,400
You know, like that gif.

229
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,400
It's like, there's all these weird, unfinished things.

230
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:32,400
And I really feel like so much of the infrastructure, they're building as they go along.

231
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,400
Like, it was some mandate within Nintendo.

232
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,400
That fucking thing is coming out on November 18th, come hell or high water,

233
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,400
no matter what has to happen to make that happen.

234
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,400
So there's still a lot of unfinished stuff.

235
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,400
But, Loki, before you get your smart-ass comment out, I'm going to say on the plus side,

236
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:54,400
getting to play Mario in HD, with what little time I spent with it so far,

237
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,400
it's a pretty solid Mario game, and I'm really enjoying it.

238
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:04,400
And just kind of like, wow, it looks great, and it plays neat, and so far I'm enjoying it.

239
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:13,400
I also really love the subtle touch of the music being different on the television and on the Wii U gamepad.

240
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,400
Like, it is really cute how, like, some instruments will be on the TV and some are on the gamepad.

241
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:22,400
It creates this really neat 3D sound that you don't really have anywhere else.

242
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,400
And it's kind of a neat little, it's a neat little thing. I like that.

243
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,400
So yes, Loki, I know you're dying to comment on my consumer horridom, so please.

244
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,400
No, I'm just saying that I don't know why you're surprised that there's stuff that's not finished for the Wii U launch.

245
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:40,400
They did the same thing with the Wii, the DS, the 3DS, it's just Nintendo.

246
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,400
And they're, well, we want people to buy our stuff, but oh hey, it's not complete.

247
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:50,400
You know, all those wonderful features that we were pimping out during our E3 conferences,

248
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,400
hey, TV, Nintendo TV, nope, not fucking there.

249
00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:00,400
Oh hey, Rayman Legends, really awesome launch game, launch window, by launch window he means coming out five months later.

250
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,400
I mean, come on.

251
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:08,400
At the end of the day though, what's the rule, the system is only as good as the games that are on it, blah blah blah, right?

252
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:12,400
So how solid are the games? And I think the question you have to ask yourself is do you need this new Mario game,

253
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,400
because that's clearly the all-star out of the bunch, I think for most people.

254
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,400
Although ZombiU, a lot of people are saying really nice things about that.

255
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:24,400
I haven't played it myself, but I'm hearing if you like old school Resident Evil games.

256
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,400
And then Nintendo Land, your typical pack-in game.

257
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:34,400
You know, I only did a little bit of Nintendo Land, but I like some of the variety in some of the games.

258
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:41,400
I don't think Wii Sports level is going to draw people in, but I think it's a neat way to show off the console.

259
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:48,400
I did a video chat too with Shane, and it's okay.

260
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,400
I mean, the quality is kind of comparable to FaceTime.

261
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:57,400
It's a little slow to connect, and then it does this really weird transition thing when you connect to the other person,

262
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,400
where it ripples in, and it plays this music like,

263
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:06,400
It's like this big debut, like, oh my god, I'm going to video chat!

264
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:11,400
And then like, oh hey, it's Shane. I haven't seen him before.

265
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,400
It's just like, oh, your princess is in another castle, but here's Shane.

266
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,400
Poor Shane.

267
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:27,400
But the quality was good enough that I could see his doggy running down the stairs in the back of the room,

268
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:32,400
and I was like, oh, although when he was looking at my setup,

269
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:36,400
Jason was sitting back here at the table, and I'm like, Shane, say hi to Jason.

270
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,400
He's like, hi, he's doing that whole, I don't know who I'm saying hi to,

271
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,400
and he told me later, he's like, yeah, I couldn't see Jason,

272
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,400
but I could totally make out the Wendy's bag that was sitting on the table, so I know where he ate dinner.

273
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,400
And that's how I really want to be remembered. My last meal.

274
00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:01,400
And then you can draw on it, but, you know, so I was writing, like, hello, and all that stupid stuff.

275
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:06,400
So anyway, my time with the Wii U has been interesting so far.

276
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,400
I think they're going to kind of keep adding to it.

277
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,400
And at the end of the day, if you want a Wii U, you just have to ask yourself, how bad do I want the games?

278
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,400
Because the infrastructure right now is not really where it's at.

279
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:22,400
Like, there's still a lot of, like, I want to be able to explain Miiverse to all of you.

280
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,400
I don't fucking understand it at all. Like, I thought it was supposed to be like Twitter,

281
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,400
but you don't really make public posts. You can either send messages to people,

282
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:36,400
or you comment on community posts, which in turn are public.

283
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,400
And people, like, I don't fucking get it.

284
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:45,400
It's okay. Nintendo doesn't fucking get it either. They just put this shit together and, like, done.

285
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:51,400
It looks like Facebook or Twitter. We're gonna just say this is our online network right here.

286
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,400
Raginator in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says,

287
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,400
So, what was the TTP for the newer listeners?

288
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,400
It's an old OLR acronym for Time to Penis. Whenever there is a new piece of hardware,

289
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,400
we always measure what's going to be the time before somebody puts their dick in it.

290
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,400
Oh, I'm sure it was a few seconds.

291
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,400
No, because he's asking, what was the TTP with the video chat?

292
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,400
Shane and I don't, we're just friends, so that was not a thing. Sorry.

293
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,400
But I'm sure somebody else-

294
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,400
But Rob totally had a penis up on his iPhone.

295
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
I'm kidding. I don't know.

296
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,400
I'm like, I did? Maybe if I was looking at porn. I don't know. Alright, anyway.

297
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
But, yeah, that wasn't part of it.

298
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,400
So, let's see. Tigerclaw says,

299
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,400
One thing's for sure. Expect Rob to post nothing but kiddie pics on the Wii U.

300
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:44,400
I would love to post a broad- like, I would- if you want to follow me on the Miiverse thing,

301
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,400
although I'm not sure what that will accomplish, but I'm Rob Roberts.

302
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,400
So, all one word, Rob Roberts, so you can follow me or whatever.

303
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,400
And I'll be happy to post kiddie pictures publicly, but I can't- like, it won't let me do it.

304
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,400
Like, I don't know how- like, unless I go randomly reply to some community message,

305
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,400
like, oh, no one care about the Skylanders community, let me just go post my kiddie pics here.

306
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,400
Like, we need- all the Nintendo communities in Miiverse right now are just game communities.

307
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,400
Like, I need a kiddie community.

308
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,400
Where's my lolcat community? Anyhow.

309
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:24,400
Well, they don't understand online. It's just- it's the way it is.

310
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,400
Yeah, now they have online. They have something that sort of resembles what we had last generation.

311
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:35,400
You know, if we're gonna consider this another generation, but they just don't get it still.

312
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:41,400
And, I don't know, it's just- enjoy, I guess.

313
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:47,400
I'm gonna be honest. I'm gonna be honest. My early thought, and keep in mind, early impressions can sometimes change.

314
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,400
So here's my disclaimer. This is my early thought.

315
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,400
I kind of think the Wii U is not- I mean, it's not a next-gen system. It's not.

316
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,400
It is more the pinnacle of this generation.

317
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:05,400
I get what they're trying to do with the whole controller thing. It is kind of a neat experience.

318
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,400
I'll give them that. It's, you know, I hazed it a lot earlier on.

319
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:15,400
But that tablet is really fucking crystal clear, and it does enhance some of the games. It's pretty neat.

320
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:25,400
But I'm not sure, like, I really don't feel like I am in the next gen of gaming, or this is really pushing the envelope as far as graphics and everything go.

321
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,400
No, it's more like Nintendo's finally playing catch-up. Yay, they're caught up. You know?

322
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,400
Until next year.

323
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:36,400
Now I get to finally play Mario in HD and so forth. So, at least that's where I'm at right now.

324
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,400
Rama in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, Reggie said it wasn't next gen.

325
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:50,400
And you know, that's a fair response, because we as gamers make all this shit a competition sometimes.

326
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:56,400
You know, and Nintendo is trying to say, wait a minute, wait a minute, no, we're not a next gen, we're the other gen.

327
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,400
It was the exact same thing with the Wii. It was the exact same thing with the Wii.

328
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,400
That's just an easy way to argue that your system sucks. I mean, it's-

329
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,400
Well, hold on though.

330
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,400
Oh, we're not competing with anybody, we're in our own market, therefore we're number one. I mean, that's stupid.

331
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:15,400
But the Wii sold more than PlayStations and Xboxes, that is fact. You cannot dispute that.

332
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,400
The Wii was the winner of those last three consoles. Whether you like it or not, that's the way it is.

333
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:24,400
Well, it's because they had a great pack-in game, everyone bought it. Not gonna happen this generation though.

334
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,400
Nothing wrong with that last generation, but I think I agree with him about the Wii U.

335
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:38,400
And I think I said as much when I called after I was at the launch experience, is that because of the higher tier in order to actually have a pack-in,

336
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,400
and the fact that there is not something that you just drop into, it's been forever since I played Wii Sports,

337
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:50,400
you turn it on, you pick a game, and you start playing. There are a lot more hurdles from what I've seen of the Wii U,

338
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,400
and that's unfortunately quite detrimental to the commoner.

339
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:01,400
The thing with the Wii U is that they assume they're really targeting this at people that bought Wiis.

340
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:07,400
They're not targeting this at new consumers, because if you're a new consumer, then guess what?

341
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:12,400
You can't play multiplayer, because you got one fucking controller and no other controllers with it.

342
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,400
You have to go buy all those $40 controllers, and all the nunchucks that go along with that,

343
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:23,400
and all the other accessories that you need to play those games, because once again, they marketed this at people that own the Wii.

344
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:31,400
And those people that own the Wii, some of whom, yes, will buy the system, but you're not gonna see old folks' homes or anything like that,

345
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:36,400
purchasing this to play Nintendo Land, no one's gonna give a fuck, because they're playing Wii Sports still.

346
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,400
I just, you know what, okay, I gotta wrap up, because I gotta go to the next thing, because we have another big thing coming up,

347
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,400
even before gaming weeks, we got another big thing.

348
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,400
And you know, I seriously have nothing to say about any of this.

349
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
Really? As a gamer, you have no opinion?

350
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,400
Because I don't have one, probably not gonna get one.

351
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,400
I mean, yeah, it's nice. I told Dan I kinda wanted one.

352
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,400
You know, but I can't talk about something that I don't own.

353
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,400
And it's also, it's not something, and I say this to everybody, it's not something you really, like, have to have.

354
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:09,400
No. I mean, like, you know what I'm more excited about? Fucking Omega.

355
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,400
And that's what you're into.

356
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,400
Yeah.

357
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,400
Here's the thing, here's the thing, and I wanna kind of start to wrap this up, and I wanna make this comment,

358
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,400
is that, you know, despite all of that that you guys are saying with Wii U,

359
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,400
I really think this thing is down a similar path as 3DS.

360
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,400
And I realize 3DS to some extent is struggling as well,

361
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,400
but I think Wii U is gonna gain a lot of steam next holiday,

362
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,400
because you know that big holiday game's coming out,

363
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,400
that Zelda's coming out next Christmas, or the big Metroid or something.

364
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,400
There will be a huge game, and one thing Nintendo does very well,

365
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,400
the characters in the story, love it or not, they have rabid fans.

366
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,400
And that's gonna sway a lot of people to picking those up even next holiday,

367
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,400
even with new Xbox and new PlayStation possibly out on the market.

368
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,400
And I guess this is a whole other can of worms.

369
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,400
I think we'll have new Xbox.

370
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,400
I'm not so sure right now we're gonna have a new PlayStation next year.

371
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,400
I don't see why they should be in a rush.

372
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,400
Why should there be a new Xbox by the same token?

373
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,400
Honestly, I don't think it's really gonna be, they're not gonna be worried about it,

374
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,400
because the longer they take on their systems, the better they're gonna be.

375
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,400
And if you think about it, if they're, okay, let's just say this system is not next-gen,

376
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,400
this system is current-gen.

377
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
How are you gonna compete against the Xbox?

378
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,400
The Xbox, or the PlayStation 3 for that matter, they have a huge library of games,

379
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,400
and they're probably gonna be cheaper.

380
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,400
So, why should I?

381
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,400
And that's the other problem too, is like, I have an Xbox 360 and a PlayStation 3,

382
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,400
and even if I just had one of those, there's no need for me to buy a Wii U,

383
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,400
unless I really want to play New Super Mario Brothers in HD,

384
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,400
which, you know, it's kind of like, you know,

385
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,400
I probably would have already played it on the Wii, or on the 3DS, or on the DS.

386
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:51,400
And it's just not that, no, it's just like throwing a fresh coat of paint on an old game.

387
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,400
It's fun.

388
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,400
Yeah, cool, Mario games are fun, and I can play New Super Mario Brothers on the Wii,

389
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,400
on the 3DS, on the DS.

390
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:07,400
I don't need to buy a brand new system for $350, plus the game, to play it.

391
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,400
Play it, it's not worth $410.

392
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,400
Alright, we have a whole nother year to debate this shit until the next console comes out.

393
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,400
I do want to transition to something else here, Jason, final thought.

394
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:25,400
Um, long-term claim chowder, because of his kid, Loki's gonna be surprisingly in Nintendo camp in about four years, five years?

395
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,400
Nah, he'll train the kid to love Call of Duty.

396
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,400
He's not gonna love Call of Duty.

397
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,400
He can love whatever he wants, but that still doesn't matter.

398
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,400
Because if he wants to play a Mario game, guess what?

399
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,400
There's the Nintendo, there's the Super Nintendo, there's the Game Boy, there's the DS, there's the Wii.

400
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,400
I have plenty of Nintendo consoles to play all these stupid games.

401
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,400
I don't need to buy a brand new system to play New Super Mario Brothers with a fresh coat of paint.

402
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,400
No, forget it.

403
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,400
Yet you already have that many of them.

404
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,400
No, I don't have those systems, but I have emulators.

405
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:01,400
I can emulate all those systems and I have a Wii, which, let's see, the last time I played that Wii was a few years ago.

406
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,400
Well, actually it was a couple months ago, but that was my wife playing the Wii.

407
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,400
Alright, we're gonna go to a call, because we're gonna go have a chat with Rama.

408
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,400
And I believe he has a friend there with him, too, from...

409
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,400
Hi, you there, Rama?

410
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,400
I'm right here.

411
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,400
Hey, and you have a buddy with you, right? From AJS?

412
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,400
Yeah, hold on for one second, I'm gonna bring him right in.

413
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,400
And he's right there.

414
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,400
Oh, hey, look at that. Conference call on Skype. Hey, how you doing?

415
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,400
Doing fabulous.

416
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,400
This is... Forgive me if I'm saying this wrong, Taiki?

417
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,400
Taiki.

418
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,400
Taiki, how you doing?

419
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,400
Fabulous. Fantastic.

420
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,400
Awesome. So you guys were at the launch event last night, right?

421
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,400
That's correct, sir.

422
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:50,400
And so I'm guessing, you know, all them media cameras were everywhere and it was hype, hype, hype, hype. Was it hype, hype, hype?

423
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,400
No.

424
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,400
To me it was a lot of hype and a lot of the chill, chill, chill.

425
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,400
Yeah?

426
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:13,400
Well, from what I observed, some media, but you know how media goes. It was a little directed. Nintendo told them where to go, what to shoot, at least as far as I could tell.

427
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:22,400
There was a lot going on in the crowd, but it seemed like the media really didn't want to be there.

428
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,400
Wow.

429
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,400
That was my, that was my, that's my opinion.

430
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:33,400
You know what though? From my limited time when I was studying to be originally in college, I was going to be a broadcast journalist. Here I am.

431
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:43,400
That doesn't surprise me. They get very unenthusiastic about a lot of things. I think it's just, you know, you build up a resistance to hype, you know, but anyway.

432
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,400
Right.

433
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:53,400
So you guys both went as media to cover it and so forth for AJS and OLR, but did you guys walk out of there with one? Rama?

434
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,400
No.

435
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,400
No? Taiki?

436
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,400
Nope.

437
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,400
No? What, what made you not want to do it?

438
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:08,400
I had to go see my folks next, next month. So between, between that, yeah. Plus I would also be massively jumping the line, although that would have been great.

439
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,400
Oh, did they sell out that night?

440
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:24,400
No, but there was a considerable line. After the event ended, we all went to McDonald's to get a little, to get a little nosh. And when we left heading back to the train station, we noticed that there were still about, I would say about 50 to 100 people still in line.

441
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,400
Wow.

442
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Yeah.

443
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:37,400
And from my knowledge, the line went up until about five o'clock in the morning because some people on my Facebook, oh, let's just say one of my friends kind of went home dejected.

444
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,400
Oh, ouch.

445
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:50,400
That's unfortunate. All right. Well, you guys are at the event and you guys got some interviews and so forth. So we want to play those here on the show. So tell us about what I'm playing.

446
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,400
Well, the ones with the market share, that was Taiki's idea. Taiki, you take that one.

447
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:13,400
Okay. So we were at the Duane Reade across the street from the Nintendo World Store, you know, preparing. We had about four hours to go. So I'm thinking, it's time for some Red Bull. So we leave and I'm looking at the line and I was thinking there's probably something interesting, something interesting here.

448
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:21,400
I mean, he's got a lot of people here who obviously enjoy fun. Let's bring it down a little. Let's do something a little more fun.

449
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:38,400
My thought was we need to do something with these people in line. And, you know, you've seen those segments on Conan where they send someone like Triumph or whoever to the line and they start, you know, I was thinking we need to do something like that, but not insulting, but very funny and very much inside gaming.

450
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:55,400
So my idea was let's start asking people who, you know, look like they're a little older, who will know older consoles. What will the Wii U do to the market share for, say, the Dreamcast or the Neo Geo or the Jaguar?

451
00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:03,400
All right. Let's check out some of these interviews with people and gauging the impact of the Wii U on the market share.

452
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,400
We found this man in line. What is your name, sir?

453
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,400
John, but you can call me the Hux.

454
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:14,400
The Hux? Interesting. So Wii U, what do you think?

455
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:23,400
It looks like a very interesting console. Good innovation. I'm really impressed with the changes they've made to the network specifically.

456
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:30,400
But some of the launch titles look good. I'm sure it's only going to go uphill from here. And I'm really impressed with the controller as well.

457
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:36,400
Okay. And speaking of the controller, how do you think that the Wii U is going to impact the Dreamcast market share?

458
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:43,400
The Dreamcast market share. Dreamcast is probably the best system, number one. And all I know is if I want to...

459
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,400
You're very brave saying that in front of the Nintendo World Store, sir.

460
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:59,400
Hey. Dreamcast. Go buy one. Buy some CD-ROMs. Go get a disc burner. I don't know what you're going to do. Put some games on there. Play that up.

461
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:05,400
This man knows what's up. This man knows what's up.

462
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,400
Your name, sir? Jason.

463
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,400
Jason, what do you think of the Wii U?

464
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,400
I'm really excited for the Wii U. I've always been a hardcore Nintendo fan, so...

465
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:19,400
What do you think of the new controller? I think it's awesome, dude. I think it's a big step forward in gaming in general.

466
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:24,400
So, what do you think that the Wii U is going to do to the TurboGrafx-16's market share?

467
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,400
So, that's a serious question?

468
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,400
Dead serious.

469
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,400
You know what? I'm not even worried about market shares.

470
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:37,400
So, wait a minute. We've got a new Mario game. How do you think that's going to compare to Bonk?

471
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,400
I mean, Bonk has its place. You can't take that away from Bonk.

472
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,400
The man knows the stuff. Let's go.

473
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,400
And your name, sir?

474
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,400
My name is Plino Bozzato.

475
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,400
Alright, and what do you think of the Wii U?

476
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:56,400
I think it's going to be awesome. I'm really excited about that. I really am.

477
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,400
What do you think of the new controller?

478
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,400
I think it's very innovative. It's fresh.

479
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:08,400
And it's nice because after the Wii, which was very innovative and brought something new,

480
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:13,400
I think this controller is a follow-up and it's really nice. Can't wait.

481
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,400
What do you think that the Wii U is going to do to the Neo Geo's market share?

482
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:25,400
Oh, wow. I don't have an idea. I hope it's going to keep the leadership that we brought.

483
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,400
I don't know.

484
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,400
Thank you.

485
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,400
You're welcome.

486
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,400
My name is Kim.

487
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,400
Hi, Kim. What do you think of the Wii U?

488
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,400
I think it's amazing. I can't wait to play it. I'm so excited.

489
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,400
So what do you think of the new Wii U controller?

490
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:44,400
It's actually very light. I've played it before, so it's surprisingly light and it's just amazing.

491
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,400
It brings the whole game to life.

492
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,400
So what do you think that the Wii U is going to do to the Sega Saturn's market share?

493
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,400
Sega Saturn?

494
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,400
Sega Saturn.

495
00:32:54,400 --> 00:33:00,400
Panzer Dragoon, Virtuon, Virtua Fighter.

496
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,400
Your name, sir?

497
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,400
Carlos Rivera.

498
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,400
Carlos, what do you think of the Wii U?

499
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:10,400
Oh, I'm very excited about it. I've been reading up on it since they announced it was going to come out,

500
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,400
and that's why I'm here now, to get it.

501
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,400
Excellent, excellent. What do you think of the new controller?

502
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,400
Oh, I love the tablet controller. I love the fact that it's a tablet.

503
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:24,400
You can play the games on it, other than your screen. I love that.

504
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,400
What do you think this is going to do to the Atari Jaguar's market share?

505
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:32,400
The Atari Jaguar has that 16 numpad button controller.

506
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,400
Well...

507
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,400
That was pretty innovative.

508
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:41,400
It was pretty innovative, but I'm going to be looking into that too, of course.

509
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,400
Excellent, excellent.

510
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,400
Do you think maybe that girl might have known what an N-Gage was?

511
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,400
Maybe she should have checked on that market share. I don't know.

512
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,400
She's like, what's a Sega Saturn? I don't know.

513
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,400
That just makes me hurt in my heart.

514
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,400
Please, no one remembered what the N-Gage was.

515
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,400
I love the people in the background going, whoa, Wii U, whoa!

516
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,400
Sega Saturn, I'm not into astronomy.

517
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,400
I used to have an N-Gage.

518
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,400
Yeah, I know.

519
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,400
Yeah, we gave it away.

520
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,400
So, Loki, I thought I saw you kind of twitching over there a little bit

521
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,400
when they were asking about the tablets,

522
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,400
and some of the people were kind of giving the same answer.

523
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,400
So innovative, so different, so new, so fresh.

524
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,400
No, that's not an answer. That's just like a canned answer.

525
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:29,400
That is literally right there. That is subliminal advertising.

526
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:34,400
Basically, they keep hearing it repeated to them that this is so innovative and stuff,

527
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,400
and then they go and say, oh, yeah, it's so innovative.

528
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,400
That's what they tell their friends.

529
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,400
What is so fucking innovative about this tablet?

530
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,400
Oh, it's a tablet that exists pretty much on everything right now.

531
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,400
It is a shit ton better than SmartGlass, I'll tell you that.

532
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,400
Oh, come on. That's just stupid.

533
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:53,400
SmartGlass is just a glitchy app that's early in the development cycle right now.

534
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,400
I mean, this is like the vision camera.

535
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,400
Obviously, the vision camera is crap.

536
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,400
Obviously, the Kinect camera right now is crap.

537
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,400
So, yes, I expect SmartGlass to be kind of, eh, stupid.

538
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,400
All right, what would you want to say, Rama?

539
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,400
I said SmartGlass is nothing more than a fancy Wi-Fi remote for the 360.

540
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,400
That's all it is.

541
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,400
All right, well, before we get into that.

542
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,400
So, tablets, all it is is on life for the Wii.

543
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,400
Fair enough.

544
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,400
Well, not really. I mean, the big difference that you'll see with the Wii.

545
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,400
I think it's a huge difference too, but anyway.

546
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,400
It's low latency, that's all.

547
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,400
It's latency. It's low latency.

548
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,400
Anyhow, all right, let's talk about some of these other interviews.

549
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,400
Who else did you talk to while you were there at the show?

550
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,400
Well, while we were discussing the whole market share little quip,

551
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,400
we came across this one guy named Nick who does charity for one of his closest friends

552
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,400
because they were on the line for the Wii,

553
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,400
but unfortunately, his friend passed away from leukemia,

554
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,400
so they do a chocolate charity in his honor every year.

555
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,400
Oh, that's cool. I like that. Let's hear it from this guy.

556
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,400
We found this man. Your name again, sir?

557
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,400
My name is James Brief.

558
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:05,400
James, do you have any particular connection to the Wii and Wii launch dates?

559
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:11,400
Yeah, actually, my friends and I years ago were in the same line waiting for the Wii,

560
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:17,400
and one of our friends, Nicholas Capobianco, since then, he passed away from leukemia,

561
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,400
and every year since then, our friends, we get together like we did in the old days,

562
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,400
and we have a gaming marathon where we play games.

563
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:31,400
We can stream it live on the net at nixmarathon.org, and we raise money for Child's Play.

564
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,400
It's a charity that raises money for pediatric hospitals.

565
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:41,400
Very cool. Very reminiscent of Loading Ready Runs, Desert Bus for Hope.

566
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,400
So I think that's very cool.

567
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,400
Do you have any other comments about the Wii Wii U?

568
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,400
Oh, looking forward to it.

569
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,400
What do you think this is going to do to the GameCube's market share?

570
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,400
I think connectivity is on its way back.

571
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,400
Fabulous.

572
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,400
The connectivity is on its way back.

573
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,400
Well, that's a very noble cause. That's actually really awesome.

574
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,400
So props to that guy. That's great, and the group of friends that do that.

575
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,400
I hope if I inevitably leave this world too soon, you all will do something similar.

576
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,400
I think that's great.

577
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,400
You know we will, because we love you.

578
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,400
I'll totally show in your honor.

579
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,400
I'll totally start a charity to get me game systems.

580
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,400
Stop. All right. Moving on.

581
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,400
Who else did you guys talk to?

582
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,400
Well, the next clip I called Wii U Gives Grilled Cheese Sandwiches,

583
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:30,400
it seems that the staff was handing out drinks, food to everybody that's online.

584
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,400
So as we were interviewing this one parent that's on the line for Wii U,

585
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,400
staffer comes by, hands us grilled cheese sandwiches.

586
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,400
So we're like, why not? Let's roll with it.

587
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,400
Heck yeah. Let's hear this.

588
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,400
Hey, DJ Ron Mess here.

589
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,400
We are live, well sort of live, outside of Nintendo World

590
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,400
with the thousands and thousands of the Nintendo's fans.

591
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,400
Do you hear that?

592
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,400
These people are psyched for a Wii U and you know what?

593
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,400
The Wii U makes some real good grilled cheese sandwiches.

594
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,400
Look at that. Look at that.

595
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,400
Look at that.

596
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,400
The Wii U makes really good grilled cheese sandwiches.

597
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,400
Something that the PS3 could not do, that damn George Foreman grill.

598
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,400
Now we're talking to some people out here about their thoughts about the Wii U

599
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,400
and how long have you been on the line for this console?

600
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,400
Since about 2 o'clock this afternoon.

601
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,400
So you decided not to come out here like on a Monday or Tuesday and be like, I'm number one?

602
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,400
I did have to work, but you know, somebody has to pay for the Wii U.

603
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,400
True, but do you have kids?

604
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,400
Yes.

605
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,400
Did you think about sending the kids out here to hold the spot?

606
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,400
Somebody has to go to school.

607
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,400
Well, there's a will, there is a way.

608
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,400
So tell me, is this the first time you were online for a game or a console like this?

609
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,400
Yes.

610
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,400
Why are you out here for this?

611
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,400
Right here.

612
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,400
Actually, I just wanted to see how crowded it would be.

613
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,400
This is the best system.

614
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,400
And as you can see, it is very crowded.

615
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,400
It's just a thinned out version.

616
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,400
So as you know, Christmas is right around the corner,

617
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:58,400
so how much pressure are you under to get this console under the tree?

618
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,400
Oh, a lot of pressure, a lot of pressure.

619
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,400
I'm always under pressure every Christmas.

620
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,400
How'd you set it up today?

621
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,400
Today?

622
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,400
Yeah, I don't care if I get back at midnight, I don't care.

623
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,400
Well, I remember when the Super Nintendo came out,

624
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,400
I played it and I was told, pack it up, put it back in the box,

625
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,400
and put it back under the tree.

626
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,400
No, it will go back under the tree.

627
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,400
It will not.

628
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,400
What if you just wrapped the empty...

629
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,400
There you go.

630
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,400
Have you thought about just wrapping just the empty box under the tree?

631
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,400
It could work.

632
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,400
I think that would be a good thing.

633
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,400
So what games are you planning on getting out of here with?

634
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,400
Right now, just Nintendo Land.

635
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:34,400
I'm waiting for some of the other games to come out towards the end of this year.

636
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:39,400
I'm going to buy a new Super Mario Bros. 2, Zombie U, maybe a little later after launch.

637
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,400
Hey, that sounds like a plan, so thanks a lot for your time.

638
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,400
Thank you.

639
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,400
Arigato gozaimasu.

640
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,400
Datashimashite.

641
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,400
That was a very excited family.

642
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,400
Did I hear her right?

643
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,400
They set up the tree already?

644
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,400
The tree is set up around the corner.

645
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,400
The lighting ceremony is like sometimes this or next week.

646
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,400
Oh, the Rockefeller tree. Right, right, right.

647
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

648
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,400
They usually do that over the Thanksgiving weekend.

649
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,400
All right, I gotcha. I gotcha.

650
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,400
All right, so what's this next one you got?

651
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,400
Well, Link was online, so I had to ask him, you know, what his thoughts were,

652
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,400
and did Zelda know that he left the castle?

653
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:18,400
Hey, DJ Ron Mess here at Rockefeller Center right in front of Nintendo World.

654
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,400
Take a look at that. That is an awesome view, ain't it?

655
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,400
Beautiful. Beautiful.

656
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,400
Right here, I'm chilling out with Link from Hyrule.

657
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,400
Link, what's going on, brother?

658
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,400
Just hanging out with my fellow diehard Nintendo fans

659
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,400
and enjoying the night and having a good time.

660
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,400
So what brings you here tonight, good friend?

661
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,400
Wii U, obviously.

662
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,400
What about the Wii U that you want so bad?

663
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,400
Because Nintendo, man. That's all I got to say.

664
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,400
Nintendo's the short answer.

665
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,400
The long answer is I'm really excited about the new innovation

666
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,400
that Nintendo's brought out with the new tablet controller.

667
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,400
They always set the bar with everything that they do every generation.

668
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,400
You know, they were the first for the joystick, the first for the shoulder buttons,

669
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,400
the first for the rumble feature, the first for the motion,

670
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,400
now they're the first for the touchscreen controller.

671
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,400
And that's just what they do, and they do it best.

672
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,400
Wow, this brother, he's diehard, really diehard.

673
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,400
So, Link, let me ask you.

674
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:21,400
If you're here online for the Wii U, who's watching Zelda?

675
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,400
That's an excellent question.

676
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,400
Here's the thing. Does she even know that you left the castle to be here?

677
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,400
No, I snuck out for a couple days, actually, yeah.

678
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:38,400
Well, I hope that Ganon doesn't try to roll up on your property, man.

679
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,400
She has Sheik watching her, so she'll be all right.

680
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,400
Sheik's a tough mother, you know.

681
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,400
So Sheik is watching Zelda.

682
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,400
Not Sheik, I'm sorry. Impa.

683
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,400
Because Zelda is Sheik, I made a mistake.

684
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,400
Impa's watching.

685
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,400
An old woman is watching Zelda?

686
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,400
Yeah, she's a Sheikah. She's tough.

687
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,400
Well, you can't beat that kind of logic, so thank you, good sir.

688
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,400
Thank you very much.

689
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,400
Yep, thank you very much.

690
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,400
Hey, no problem.

691
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,400
So, Loki, I know that guy, you know, at first I was like,

692
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,400
oh, he's just another kind of blind Nintendo fanboy.

693
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,400
However, he made a pretty damn good point.

694
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,400
Nintendo tends to set the bar with a lot of their shit.

695
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,400
I know you were sitting there going, joystick?

696
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,400
They didn't do the joystick, but they did.

697
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:23,400
You can say that Nintendo set the bar for the modern gamepad.

698
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,400
The Kinect would have never happened if it wasn't for the Wii.

699
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,400
Thoughts?

700
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,400
The Kinect would have happened.

701
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,400
I mean, it's camera technology.

702
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,400
The Kinect wouldn't have happened if the iToy hadn't happened.

703
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,400
Well, I just think that they should have stuck with the Coleco's model.

704
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,400
I miss my Intellivision pad.

705
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:47,400
Is the Coleco the one where you put the plastic stuff on the TV?

706
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,400
Or is it the fairchild?

707
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,400
No, you didn't put it on the TV.

708
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,400
You slid a little thing into the number pad.

709
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,400
What was the thing that you would actually have to put the overlays on the television?

710
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,400
Was that the fairchild?

711
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,400
Odyssey.

712
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,400
Odyssey, thank you.

713
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,400
Well, you know, actually the Odyssey 2 didn't have,

714
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,400
I had a couple games that used that, but not many that did.

715
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,400
Alright, we still have a few more interviews to go,

716
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,400
but you know I had to grill Loki on that.

717
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:13,400
Sounds like a lot of really great fans there at the event, right?

718
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,400
Oh yeah, especially the dancing Miis.

719
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,400
Oh god, really?

720
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,400
Yeah.

721
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,400
Alright, what's this next interview we got?

722
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,400
This is a quick one.

723
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,400
Well, I had ran off to do something and I came back.

724
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,400
Mario had picked up the microphone and started talking to people in the crowd,

725
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,400
and me as Luigi, I had some words for him.

726
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,400
So you were dressed as Black Luigi?

727
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,400
Yes, I was.

728
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,400
Alright, so this is Mario and Black Luigi. Here we go.

729
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,400
What am I doing in the commentary? What are you doing, Luigi?

730
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,400
I was also doing the commentary.

731
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,400
Why are you not in your mansion? You're going to get scared by the ghosts.

732
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,400
You should be off chasing after Peach again.

733
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:52,400
I need a break. I always chase after Peach. Peach never give me nothing.

734
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,400
I need a break.

735
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,400
So is that why she ran off with Bowser again?

736
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,400
Yeah.

737
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,400
Don't you go screwing this thing over. Bowser will take her heart.

738
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,400
She not take Bowser.

739
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,400
So how's that not my fault?

740
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,400
That's not your fault. You get out of here.

741
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,400
You get out of here.

742
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,400
Aww.

743
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,400
Rama, you know I love you. You're the biggest goddamn nerd.

744
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,400
Yes. Yes, I know.

745
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,400
Alright.

746
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,400
You too.

747
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,400
What's this next one?

748
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:25,400
This one was Taiki's idea of talking to Mario about the financial crisis in the Mushroom Kingdom.

749
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:31,400
I mean, just to give a quick recap. New Super Mario 2.

750
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,400
You have to collect the million coins to get the special statue.

751
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:38,400
My first thought is there's clearly a financial crisis in the Mushroom Kingdom.

752
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,400
Alright. Let's hear about that. Is the Mushroom Kingdom about to go off a fiscal cliff?

753
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,400
Uh, who knows?

754
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,400
Alright. Let's hear it.

755
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,400
What would the funny physics in the Mario...

756
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:52,400
Oh, sorry. I was playing the interview over you. Go ahead.

757
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,400
With the funny physics in the Mushroom Kingdom. I don't know if that's possible.

758
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,400
Alright. Let's hear the clip.

759
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,400
This is Taiki with a voice of Greeks.

760
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,400
And this is for special report. The financial crisis in the Mushroom Kingdom.

761
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,400
I have Mario here. Mario, I've been told you've been tasked to collect a million coins.

762
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,400
What are your thoughts on the current financial status in the Mushroom Kingdom?

763
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,400
Oh, it's very tough at times. Very tough at times indeed.

764
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:23,400
My new game, New Super Mario Bros. 2, is not about me fighting Bowser to fight the Princess Peach.

765
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:28,400
No. It's about me getting enough money so that Princess Peach can keep the castle.

766
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,400
Otherwise, no more castle. And for me, no more heroing.

767
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,400
No more heroing. No more games.

768
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,400
I need to get the coins.

769
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:39,400
Oh, it's a bigger problem. Aye, aye, aye, aye.

770
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:43,400
So the rumors that they are foreclosing on the castle at the Mushroom Kingdom is true.

771
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:47,400
What rumors? I don't hear nothing. I just have a peach.

772
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,400
Sir, you're avoiding the question.

773
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:53,400
What question? You look a lot like a Koopa.

774
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:55,400
What? I should stop you?

775
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,400
No. I'm just asking questions, sir. Just asking questions.

776
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:05,400
So what are your thoughts on the overabundance of S.T.A.R.S. and how that's affected the stock market?

777
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:09,400
Overabundance of S.T.A.R.S. makes Mario invincible.

778
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:14,400
Invincible Mario kick ass? What problem?

779
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:18,400
There's a massive price crash on S.T.A.R.S.

780
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,400
Oh, I see, I see.

781
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,400
Mario doesn't understand economics, does he?

782
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:28,400
Not very much, no. I stomp on the goombas, I kick at the Koopas.

783
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,400
I beat at the buzzer, I collect the coins, and I get nothing from a peach.

784
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,400
Not even cake?

785
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,400
Not even cake. Oh, woe isn't me.

786
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:43,400
And that was Taiki, voice of the geek network, signing off.

787
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:48,400
Who was that guy actually? Just like a die hard fan or what?

788
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,400
Pretty much.

789
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:53,400
Okay. A crazy person.

790
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,400
Crazy hobo.

791
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:57,400
Hobo with a shotgun?

792
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,400
I liked it.

793
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,400
Just saw him in the line getting interviewed by someone at Nintendo.

794
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:10,400
Okay. So did you guys get on some of the news stations dressed up or what happened?

795
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:16,400
Me, not really, because the only people I saw there was people from Nintendo, that was just about it.

796
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:21,400
But there was photographers and someone from Weekly Famitsu took my picture.

797
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,400
Oh, hey. Nice.

798
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:25,400
And Mashable was there as well.

799
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,400
Yeah, I was also speaking with some of the other press people there.

800
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:34,400
Yomiuri Shimbun was also there, a couple other press outlets were there too.

801
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,400
That's true. We do have to remember that we actually got the system before Japan.

802
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:41,400
This is one of those kind of, you know, it doesn't happen all the time, but kind of different.

803
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,400
Didn't it happen with the last Wii and the 3DS?

804
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,400
I guess it tends to happen more with Nintendo than does the other companies.

805
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,400
Because it seems like PlayStation and Vita and all that were out way earlier.

806
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,400
I know the Xbox is always coming out earlier over in Japan.

807
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,400
Well, Xbox makes a stud in Japan. All right.

808
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:59,400
Just they don't sell one for a few months.

809
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:04,400
Oh, whatever. All right. These last two interviews are some big ones.

810
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,400
So set this one up for us, Rama. What's next for us?

811
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:14,400
Well, at the front of the line was Triforce, who says he was there on the line for about a month.

812
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:20,400
And he has some bit of surprising news to let the fans know about him doing console launches.

813
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,400
Ooh, okay. Let's hear it.

814
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:29,400
Hey, DJ Varmus here in front of Nintendo World USA, where in just mere hours,

815
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,400
the new Wii U is going to hit the store shelves and take names and kick a lot of butt.

816
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,400
Now, as you can see behind me, there are die-hard fans out here.

817
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,400
How die-hard are you guys?

818
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,400
How long have you all been out here?

819
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:50,400
As you can see, but through the maze and through the vines, we're here with the one, the only, Triforce.

820
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,400
Good to meet you, sir.

821
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,400
What's going on, guys?

822
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,400
Not much. We do what we got to do. So tell me, how long have you been waiting out here?

823
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,400
Almost a month, since March 23.

824
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,400
I'm getting serious. Since March 23.

825
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,400
I'm still thinking about the 3DS since October 23.

826
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,400
October 23. Now, that's hard. That's dedication.

827
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,400
I tip my hat to you, good sir.

828
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,400
So, I do recall that you were somewhere else for the Wii, is that correct?

829
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:27,400
Yes, it was Toys R Us, and that was back in November. I can remember that date.

830
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:31,400
Oh yeah, we all remember that. So, why here instead of there?

831
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:39,400
First of all, this is my last launch that I'm going to be doing, and I took a guess.

832
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:43,400
I did some investigating, and I just felt that they were going to do the launch here.

833
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:48,400
See, that's where it is, because you know what? We talked to people about the Wii, and I kept telling everyone,

834
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,400
Nintendo World is the jump-off spot, because this is where the party is at.

835
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,400
So, how many of these launch events have you done?

836
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,400
This is my 8th and final one.

837
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,400
Why is it your final one, good sir?

838
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:05,400
I want to go and try to do some type of other marketing in the gaming community from the urban market,

839
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:10,400
you know, from the grassroots side, and although I do a lot of this,

840
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,400
I want to leave this for somebody else to do while I can help out elsewhere.

841
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:20,400
You know, I've done enough of it, and I'm 35 years old, so now's the time to stop.

842
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:26,400
That's not to say that I won't be at other launch parties, but the whole camping for the first, I'm going to stop it. This is it.

843
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:33,400
So, in other words, after this, someone else is going to inherit the Power Glove, like you now have the power.

844
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,400
Oh, they're going to fight you for it?

845
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:39,400
No, they're not getting that. They're just going to have to line up. That's it. I'm keeping the Power Glove.

846
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:43,400
Between you and me, I stomp somebody out for that to keep my Power Glove?

847
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:45,400
Well, that may happen, yeah.

848
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,400
So, what was your first launch?

849
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,400
The Nintendo DS.

850
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,400
And how was that compared to the launch for the Wii U?

851
00:50:52,400 --> 00:51:00,400
Well, each year, Nintendo gets better with the launch. That was all the way back in 2004, and that was the first launch that I got first in.

852
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:08,400
My first ever launch was the Nintendo 64. I was the first in line, but that's what made me get into the whole launch thing.

853
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:14,400
Then after that, some unmentionables. I won't mention the name of the other competitors.

854
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,400
Oh, those guys.

855
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:21,400
Those guys, yeah. That's because I was working for GameStop, so I had to work the launch party.

856
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,400
So, it wasn't as fun?

857
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:29,400
No, I wouldn't say it wasn't as fun. I wasn't in the line for the launch. I just worked the launch party.

858
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:34,400
And then, the first launch party I became first for was the Nintendo DS.

859
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:40,400
That's wonderful. I can't believe you're doing this for so long. Eight launches, it all ends here.

860
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:45,400
So, if you're not here right now watching History in the Making, I don't know what to tell you. Peace out.

861
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,400
Leave me alone. I was asleep. No, that's crazy. That's his last launch.

862
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:57,400
It's interesting that he's kind of chalking it up to being 35 and all that, which is interesting because I'm kind of like,

863
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:01,400
well, I'm pretty much 35 and we're not ending OLR anytime soon.

864
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:07,400
But, I can also understand the whole like, okay, I don't need to be first anymore.

865
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:12,400
I don't have to be that guy anymore. I can let it go. I get that.

866
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:19,400
And he wants to kind of pursue the other stuff. That's certainly reasonable. So, you know, props to him for being so damn dedicated.

867
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:24,400
Yeah, it's like that line from Lethal Weapon, I'm getting too old for this shit.

868
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:36,400
Alright, we got one more interview from the event and dare I say, it's an Orange Lounge Radio VOG Network exclusive we're about to get.

869
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,400
Yes, we can.

870
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:42,400
Alright, and I've been teasing a little bit on Twitter that you had a pretty big interview.

871
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:48,400
But, it's short, but we wanted this to be special for the fans that actually bothered to tune in and listen tonight.

872
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,400
Rama, please set up this last interview.

873
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:59,400
Well, the man shows up and we all know who the man is, Reggie.

874
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:04,400
He's going through the crowd, doing autographs and saying hi to everyone.

875
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:10,400
And we catch him right before he goes inside Nintendo World and me and Taiki ask him a few couple of quick questions.

876
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:17,400
Okay, you're gonna have to set up the clip a little longer than that. The live listeners literally just got dropped.

877
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:27,400
Word must have gone up, but see, Rama, you're always the first to complain about the live stream going down and yet here we are still talking to each other. Isn't that funny?

878
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,400
I know.

879
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:36,400
Alright, with the apologies to the podcast listeners who are hearing this for the second time, Rama, go ahead and set it up one more time.

880
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:46,400
No problem. Well, the man of the hour, Reggie Fils-Aime, shows up and talks to the crowd in front of Nintendo World.

881
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:56,400
He's going through the crowd saying hi, doing autographs, and me and Taiki catch him right before he goes into Nintendo World and we shoot him about two or three questions.

882
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:05,400
Okay, this is gonna be really awkward, but the stream just went down again. We were up for like two seconds and then it went down.

883
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:15,400
I need you guys to kill all excess internet activity. I'm just saying, I need everybody across the board. Any chat, I need it all closed because this is killing the show with all these computers running.

884
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,400
So, alright.

885
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,400
Even my torrents of shiza porn?

886
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:24,400
Yeah, any torrents of that stuff, any dropbox that might be hiding in the background or whatever, it's gotta all go down.

887
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:37,400
So, okay. We are connected, here we go. Sorry, podcast listeners, I feel like Seacrest on American Idol, where it's like I'm drawing it out for like two minutes, the big interview, but please know it's for the live listeners' benefit.

888
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:42,400
Okay, I am showing and it's streaming again, so here we go. The big interview with Reggie.

889
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,400
That's good.

890
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,400
Absolutely.

891
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,400
Eric, how excited are you? How excited?

892
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:50,400
I'm very excited.

893
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,400
This is it, right?

894
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:53,400
This is it.

895
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,400
A new generation of gaming begins tonight.

896
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,400
What's your name?

897
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,400
Is that a British accent?

898
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,400
Yeah.

899
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,400
Came all the way from the UK just to be here?

900
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,400
No, actually.

901
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:13,400
No, come on, you could have played me. You said yes, came all the way here.

902
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,400
Reggie, small question.

903
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:28,400
A million coins in Newsroom Mario 2. Do you have any comments about the current economic crisis in Mushroom Kingdom?

904
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:38,400
You know, Mario's just trying to do his part. He's collecting coins. He'll go back and spend them someday, but he's trying to help out. There will be no fiscal cliff in the Mushroom Kingdom.

905
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,400
Thank you very much.

906
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,400
Thank you.

907
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,400
Did you get it?

908
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:47,400
All right, so you have the chance to ask Reggie one thing.

909
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:57,400
And you chose to ask him how he feels about the fiscal cliff in the Mushroom Kingdom.

910
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:05,400
But you gotta admit that he actually picked up on it and rolled with it. You got to give the man credit for that.

911
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:13,400
Orange Lounge Radio exclusive, everybody. Reggie comments on the fiscal cliff in the Mushroom Kingdom.

912
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:21,400
I mean, that's pretty cool and all. It's almost as good as me asking, you know, what Jason Enos about in the group.

913
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:29,400
But I'm sure asking them about the financial crisis in a fictional video game is fucking awesome. That's great use of time.

914
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,400
Well, I mean, he's going to get into the media and he's going to answer all these questions about whatever.

915
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,400
There needs to be a bumper.

916
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:42,400
To be fair, it will be a bumper, but to be fair, Loki, you know damn well it doesn't matter what they ask.

917
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:49,400
They would have got the same canned answer for anything. So for them to throw him a curveball, I say you guys are the biggest fucking nerds.

918
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,400
And I so appreciate that about you.

919
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:53,400
Thank you.

920
00:56:55,400 --> 00:57:02,400
I think that was brilliant. I would rather have had that than the canned response, because if we want the canned response, we can look at press releases.

921
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,400
Yes, you press them for word. Yeah, whatever.

922
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,400
And the whole five seconds before he goes, I got to go inside. Bye.

923
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,400
Yeah, Loki's jealous he wasn't there. All right.

924
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:17,400
And we're not 20 20. So it's a little bit differently. And also, you could think Taiki. That was his idea. All right.

925
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,400
That went over damned well.

926
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:25,400
Well, you both contributed a lot to that segment, and I really appreciate you guys sharing that with OLR first.

927
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:31,400
I know you could have held on to that for AJS, but I really appreciate that VOG podcast sticking together.

928
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,400
It's awesome.

929
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,400
Hey, that's what we're here for.

930
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,400
Plus the band has one of the official VOG sheets.

931
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:44,400
Nice. Very nice. Well, we're an hour into the show. We haven't even got to our gaming weeks yet.

932
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,400
So I'm probably going to wrap this up so we can move on. But you have anything else you guys want to get out?

933
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:52,400
Taiki, great job. Anything you want to get out here before we let you go?

934
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,400
Can I talk about the issue of Quebec independence?

935
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,400
If you want.

936
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,400
Independence for Quebec now.

937
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,400
Viva Quebec!

938
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,400
Rama, anything you want to get out?

939
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:10,400
I think I should save it for calling back later. It has something to do with we use and shame stop.

940
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:15,400
Oh boy. All right. Well, hopefully talk to you later. Hopefully we don't run too long tonight. I can take a lot of calls. All right.

941
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:16,400


942
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,400
Take care, buddy. And thanks, guys.

943
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:19,400


944
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:25,400
You can hear Anime Jam Session Tuesdays at vognetwork.com, 6.30 Pacific, 9.30 Eastern.

945
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:34,400
To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, bronze.

946
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:41,400
Big thanks to them for being out there, even though their questions were a little bit lullsy. You know what? I'll take it.

947
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:49,400
All right. Moving on. Let's get to our video game weeks. And how was our gaming week? It's only an hour into the show.

948
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:55,400
Loki! How you doing? Oh, wait. I always start with Jamie. How you doing? How was your gaming week?

949
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,400
I already know what she's going to say.

950
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,400
It was sweet.

951
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:01,400
Yeah. What's that?

952
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:09,400
I played and beat Sugar Rush on the Wreck-It Ralph website. It's fucking fun. It needs to be like a for reals game.

953
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:16,400
I mean, and I was actually really surprised by how long it was because, I mean, I was playing for a few solid hours.

954
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:23,400
It's like you have four stages with three races in each stage. And like the first two, I think, are two laps.

955
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:29,400
And then the third one is three laps. And then the last one's three laps. And it's much, much longer and complex.

956
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:37,400
And I mean, it's like a stupid little kart racer, but it was really fun. And I've decided that Rancis is the best name ever.

957
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:43,400
And my first born, if I have one, will be Rancis. Rancis Flubber Buffer, whatever his name is.

958
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:53,400
The one with the Reese's cup on his head. And then I played a bunch of Mass Effect 2. I played a bunch of it today.

959
00:59:54,400 --> 01:00:04,400
And then I actually did a whole bunch of design work, but my design work had me going and pulling samples off of old video game packaging because I wanted certain colors.

960
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:12,400
Like I pulled the gold off the Nintendo cartridge, off of the Zelda cartridge, because I wanted that particular shade.

961
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:20,400
Because it's like when you sample part of it, it comes out kind of this muted brown. And that was the color I wanted.

962
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:28,400
And I was like, what do I know that reflects that color? So I was sampling NES cartridges to get the right shade of brown off of a gold Zelda cartridge.

963
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,400
Very cool.

964
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:37,400
And I actually logged into WoW just because I don't want to get kicked out of the guild. I hate to say that.

965
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:49,400
But I mean, I'm trying to build myself back up into actually wanting to level my troll. It's just, no one plays on Blade's Edge anymore and that's the only character I really care about is my main on there.

966
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:56,400
Ragenator at live.vognetwork.com expressing surprise. DarkSakura won't name her first born, Garrus. WTF.

967
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:02,400
No. Rancis. No. Actually, I'm probably never going to have a kid, so it doesn't matter.

968
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:08,400
No, I'm serious. At this point, I'm perfectly content with it. All you people who have kids, good luck.

969
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:12,400
You know what, you will have a new kitty to name someday. It's a very similar dilemma.

970
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:21,400
I need a cat in my life right now. But Dan's like, we have to buy a house first. So I'm like, well fine, if I can buy a house so I can get a cat.

971
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:25,400
For the cat, because the cat needs the house. It won't be your house, it'll be the cat's house.

972
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:30,400
I decided that when I get a cat, it's going to be named Mochi. I don't care, my cat will be named Mochi.

973
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:33,400
That's a good name. Alright, anything else for your gaming week?

974
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:36,400
Um, um, cooking with dog.

975
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:44,400
Okay, no, because I've been going in between playing Mass Effect 2, pausing my game, making Udon because I'm also watching cooking with dog.

976
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:51,400
And then going back and playing more Mass Effect, that's been my cycle. Mass Effect, cooking with dog, cooking. Mass Effect, cooking with dog, cooking.

977
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,400
Loki, how was your gaming week?

978
01:01:54,400 --> 01:02:05,400
I played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, Call of Duty Black Ops 2 because I'm really getting into the single player campaign, tried some more of the multiplayer, just kind of some system link stuff at work.

979
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:10,400
The rest, we should be getting copies for everybody this week so we can play some of that.

980
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:17,400
And so far, I've loved every minute of it and it hasn't let me down at all, so I'm looking forward to that.

981
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:22,400
And I think I fit in a little bit of Minecraft this week as well.

982
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,400
That's pretty much it.

983
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,400
Jason, how about you? It's been a while since we've seen you last. What's been going on in your gaming world?

984
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:39,400
Well, for that time frame, no, not that whole time frame. I've actually been out here for work for a week at this point, just over a week.

985
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:46,400
So the literal week has been rather light because I've been having exciting San Francisco, California fun times.

986
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:55,400
But there is a setup at the office and the office favorite is FIFA 13, so I've been thoroughly trashed at that game, both by the computer and by my co-workers.

987
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,400
Is that the one that they're hazing for being just like FIFA 12?

988
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,400
Isn't that all sports games in this generation?

989
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,400
That's on the Wii.

990
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,400
I mean, like, for real, it is a carbon copy. Like, I'm not, like, no jet.

991
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,400
And Pro Evo are both carbon copies.

992
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:15,400
The last time I was out here, they did have FIFA 12 in the game. The only notable difference I've noticed is that they give you more interactivity during the loading screen.

993
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:21,400
But I completely admit that's completely superficial because I start a multiplayer game and go with it.

994
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:27,400
And I can't really comment to single player, you know, GM, those kind of bonus modes, anything like that. I couldn't say at all.

995
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:38,400
They did also get Halo 4 and I started a campaign by myself on, I think the tier is easy, normal, legendary, heroic, and I'm on legendary because I thought I could keep up.

996
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,400
No.

997
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,400
Oh, Dan made that mistake.

998
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:49,400
No, it might be passable with help, you know, a multiplayer legendary campaign, but me by myself, I'm still in Chapter 1.

999
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:58,400
And I gave up after playing the same checkpoint, just passed the same checkpoint about 30, 40 times, maybe more, I'm not entirely sure.

1000
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,400
I suck at Halo and I'm very, very sad at this fact.

1001
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:11,400
Otherwise, yeah, that's really it. I'm still nursing Borderlands 2 since I've been traveling quite a bit over these past two months.

1002
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:16,400
And not really sit down and play meaningful games time lately, unfortunately.

1003
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:18,400
Alrighty.

1004
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:25,400
Most of my week, I already talked about with the Wii U launch, so in the interest of time, I'm not going to repeat myself, but I will talk about just quickly.

1005
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:32,400
Played a little bit of Mass Effect 3 because we tried to set it up so that we have two TVs and two Xbox 360s here at the house.

1006
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:37,400
So Alan and I were like, can we play multiplayer with each other, even though we only have one copy of the game?

1007
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,400
And we figured out, yes, we can, because all of multiplayer is on both discs.

1008
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,400
So we put one disc in one and one in the other.

1009
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:55,400
And how we got around the online pass is I had Alan play on my usual Xbox and I played on the other one because when you have licensed content on the 360, it's licensed to the original console and your ID.

1010
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:04,400
So we made it work and we played and Alan decided he hated it because having to go from keyboard and mouse to controller, apparently not a good fit.

1011
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:14,400
I also played some Halo 4, finished the first five episodes of Spartan Ops playing with a friend. I think we actually did six.

1012
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,400
So that was cool. Halo, good times.

1013
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,400
Emphasis on with a friend.

1014
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:25,400
Yes, and I think Spartan Ops we did normal. We're not too crazy now.

1015
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:34,400
All right. Some housekeeping for you guys. Please remember, you can follow us on Facebook, facebook.com slash orange launch radio, as well as Twitter, twitter.com slash O L R.

1016
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,400
Meanwhile, let's get into some news.

1017
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,400
And a quick thank you to everybody voting in the podcast awards, which are now closed.

1018
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:48,400
Thank you very much. Absolutely. Yes. Thank you to everybody who voted for us in the podcast awards. And if you didn't, I hope you kept it indie.

1019
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,400
I forgot one more game.

1020
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:52,400
Oh, hurry. Very solid here.

1021
01:05:52,400 --> 01:06:00,400
Oh, I played that too, thanks to that tip last week. It's cute. Yeah, it's free. I can't complain. Better than Yaris.

1022
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,400
All right. Let's get into some news, Loki.

1023
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:08,400
Rob, having your head drilled open with your brains falling out is better than Yaris.

1024
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:13,400
All right. So there was a, there was a system that launched today, the Wii U.

1025
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:15,400
Really? I hadn't heard.

1026
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:21,400
I can see how you can be confused. It is very similar to the previous generation.

1027
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:27,400
You may, you may have been confused and bought another Wii, so you better double check that.

1028
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:29,400
So this one's black.

1029
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:31,400
They do make black Wiis now.

1030
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:43,400
So, let's see. You know, you know the difference between the Wii U and the Wiis. The Wii has functioning online right now. That's pretty sad.

1031
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:52,400
All right. So the Wii they claim is going to be in larger supply, probably due to less demand, but it is going to be easily more available.

1032
01:06:53,400 --> 01:07:04,400
They're not going to make their artificial shortage as big this time around, but he says basically their second and, you know, third, fourth replenishments are going to be more frequent holiday time.

1033
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:11,400
And, you know, you'll be able to get a Wii system or Wii U system before, you know, next year or next holiday, I guess.

1034
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:14,400
Which is good, I suppose.

1035
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:23,400
Unfortunately, like with most Nintendo console launches of recent, it is missing a few things.

1036
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:34,400
And the first being Nintendo's highly, you know, advertised and pimped out TV service, which was supposed to be launching with the console.

1037
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:37,400
But, you know, it's not done, so it's going to be launching in December.

1038
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:44,400
And until then, you're at the way to watch, you know, live TV through this or, you know, your on-demand stuff, Netflix, etc.

1039
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:49,400
So it'll be coming in the next few weeks unless they delay it again because, you know, something they do.

1040
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:57,400
And then also, of course, you know, fun. Yeah, I'm kidding. It's a fun console. It's an easy joke to make.

1041
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,400
Yeah, it's a fun console.

1042
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:10,400
And I'm sure that everybody was really happy, you know, that waited in line to get their Wii U system to get home and download your 5GB firmware update, which is fantastic.

1043
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:16,400
And, of course, this would also encompass, you know, the Miiverse stuff as well.

1044
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:26,400
It's funny, though, because apparently there's some people that were having issues with it downloading so slow that they thought their console was not working, so they shut it off.

1045
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:29,400
Not a good idea. And now their console doesn't work.

1046
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:41,400
But, yes, 5GB. So if you're thinking about it, if you've got that non-black system, you have less than half of that storage space left for stuff.

1047
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:52,400
Obviously, you're not going to put an actual game on there because there's no room for it, but you're not going to be able to fit, you know, you're going to basically need to get an external storage device, which is kind of...

1048
01:08:52,400 --> 01:09:00,400
You kind of would have had to anyways, but still. It's not as bad. Remember when the Xbox 360 came out and everyone's like,

1049
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:08,400
Oh, hey, the 20GB hard drive. What? 7GB of this is just, you know, the backwards compatibility data.

1050
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:15,400
This is almost as bad, except I didn't have to wait an hour for the backwards compatibility data to exist on that hard drive.

1051
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:23,400
And, of course, you know, with any network launch, this would be for MMOs and stuff, they've been having a little bit of issues.

1052
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:33,400
It's been kind of up and down, probably because of the high traffic, but thankfully it is back up. Fantastic.

1053
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:43,400
It worked fine for me, for what it's worth. To be fair, it did take an hour, but I expect that 5GB is going to take an hour to download, but it did work fine, and I haven't really had connectivity problems.

1054
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:53,400
Well, Wii video chat was a little bumpy. We got some weird error messages that weren't even true, because we were able to connect fine. It was weird.

1055
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:58,400
Warning, the person on the other end does not exist. Not quite that, but yeah.

1056
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:07,400
Oh. So, there's your Wii U launch. Get excited! I'm thrilled.

1057
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:17,400
Alright. Well, not too thrilled is this guy. He got caught by the police. Justin Success Brooks. Yes, his name was Success Brooks.

1058
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:28,400
Well, unfortunately, he wasn't very successful in his business of selling counterfeit Nintendo games in the UK, because he got caught and sentenced to 32 months of jail time.

1059
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:36,400
He was actually selling counterfeited games. He was working with some dealers in China through 18 different websites.

1060
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:47,400
Nintendo had warned. The UK border agency had warned. He had his stock seized at one point. However, he continued to sell the games through a different website, so it was kind of one of those.

1061
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:58,400
They weren't going to keep him out any other way, so they officially sentenced him to 32 months, although even in the UK, you don't really end up serving the entire time. He'll probably only be serving about half of it.

1062
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:12,400
What's interesting, Francesca Levitt, who is one of the prosecutors on this case, claiming the victim is not really Nintendo, but legitimate online game retailers who have to compete with counterfeit sellers.

1063
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:21,400
Quote, Nintendo may be big enough to weather the storm, but the damage this has done to the reputation of online retailers is untold and incalculable. That's in a statement to The Guardian.

1064
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:44,400
I would take that down one more notch, that not so much Evil G and those others, but people who do use game stores or import game stores or the people who really try to carve out their niche, that oh yeah, they also sell big retail titles, mainstream titles, because you don't survive as a business any other way.

1065
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:55,400
I think it is a good reminder that this kind of stuff doesn't just hurt Nintendo, it hurts everybody in the chain, from developers and makers to the people that sell them.

1066
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:57,400
It hurts my feelings.

1067
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:58,400
And Jamie's feelings.

1068
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:00,400
And it gives Reggie hemorrhoids.

1069
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:01,400
What?

1070
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,400
Because he's all butthurt.

1071
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:07,400
Oh, I see. Alright, let's move on with another story, Darzaka.

1072
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:11,400
Okay, well, who likes Pokemans?

1073
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:13,400
Who doesn't like Pokemans?

1074
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:17,400
Of course, Loki raised his hand.

1075
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:29,400
Well, actually Nintendo is doing Poke Deck IOS, which is their first paid app in the Apple Store. Of course, it's only out in Japan right now.

1076
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:41,400
And it covers everything up through black and white, and it's 170 yen, which is about £1.30, so I guess here it would be maybe a $3 download.

1077
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:52,400
There's also extra packs with other monsters that go up to 500 yen, so yeah, you could pay a lot of money for it.

1078
01:12:52,400 --> 01:13:03,400
But now there's still a free app that's the Pokemon Say Tap that was out for a little bit last year, but for right now this is their first paid app.

1079
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:23,400
I have to say that, and some of it may be the language, and I know that interfaces do vary highly in between languages, but this Pokedex IOS looks kind of as crap as Pokedex 3D on the 3DS Store. I never liked it.

1080
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:34,400
It may also be that I've kind of abandoned ship as far as Pokemon is concerned, and I haven't played it recently enough, so none of the creatures were familiar, but this doesn't hit me.

1081
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:37,400
I heard that this thing is full of in-game purchases too.

1082
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:43,400
Oh yeah, that's what I was saying. There's four extra packs, and they're 500 yen total.

1083
01:13:43,400 --> 01:13:44,400
They ain't free.

1084
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:47,400
No, I mean, you roughly end up paying about seven bucks.

1085
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:48,400
Wow.

1086
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:55,400
Six or seven. I'm trying to do a little bit of conversion here, but yeah, you end up paying more like about six bucks.

1087
01:13:55,400 --> 01:14:04,400
So, Loki, you gotta be excited about this. It's Nintendo on an Apple product full of microtransactions. This is like made for you.

1088
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:11,400
It sounds like just any other app on the IOS Apple Store or whatever.

1089
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:17,400
I think it's just, what's interesting is it's not a knockoff for once.

1090
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:30,400
This is true. And plus the whole, oh my gosh, it's something Nintendo on Apple, but you know, before the emails correcting us come in, we should say there's a very different relationship when it comes to the Pokemon company.

1091
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:38,400
Because they, even though Nintendo somewhat controls them at the end of the day, if the Pokemon company wants to do something different, they can.

1092
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:45,400
And so for them to be the ones dipping their big toe in with this IOS app is not, it's not too surprising.

1093
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:52,400
And it could be interesting because if this does very well, which, who knows, maybe that will cause Nintendo? I don't know.

1094
01:14:52,400 --> 01:15:02,400
But then again, Nintendo's always been very much, no, ever since the CDI, never again will our characters be on another console.

1095
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:07,400
Alright, moving on.

1096
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:16,400
Alright, so let's talk a little bit about non-Nintendo stuff. Let's talk about Microsoft.

1097
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:21,400
And of course they were celebrating the 10 year anniversary of Xbox Live.

1098
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:33,400
And with that they were giving out some fancy Xbox Live 10 year anniversary themed Xbox 360s to people that had been on live for those 10 years.

1099
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:38,400
Of course certain people didn't get them. Like Bobby.

1100
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,400
Sorry Bobby.

1101
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:44,400
But there's some, you know, some random users were getting them.

1102
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:52,400
I don't think every 10 year user got one. You probably got entered into a drawing or something behind the scenes and they gave away like 100 of them or something.

1103
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:56,400
Yeah, they never really explained it. It doesn't really make any sense to me that they would give you a console.

1104
01:15:56,400 --> 01:16:02,400
I mean that's kind of cool that you get a console, but wouldn't you already have a console if you're on Xbox Live? It's like hooray!

1105
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:08,400
All the people that won it are the people that have lived through about 5 or 6 Red Rings and E74s.

1106
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:12,400
So the next time it invariably happens to their next one, they have a replacement already.

1107
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:15,400
And it looks pretty cool actually.

1108
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:19,400
It's neat I guess.

1109
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:28,400
So yeah, so some of you who may have been on there for 10 years will maybe be getting an email or something saying hey you got a 360 coming your way.

1110
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:35,400
You probably would have already got that email or you got the email that I got that says congrats, here's your code for an avatar helmet.

1111
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:38,400
I got an email and two messages.

1112
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:42,400
Take the fucking helmet, Loki. Take it.

1113
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,400
I don't want the helmet. I'm not wearing the helmet.

1114
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:47,400
No, take it. Here's another message. Here's another code. Take the damn helmet.

1115
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:49,400
It puts the helmet on its avatar.

1116
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,400
Nice.

1117
01:16:54,400 --> 01:17:02,400
Alright, speaking of Microsoft, this is interesting because we know the PlayStation Magazine is stopping, the Nintendo Power is stopping.

1118
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:06,400
Well, Xbox World is also going to cease publishing in December.

1119
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:12,400
But this is what's interesting. This is one over in the UK and the last issue is going out with a bang.

1120
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:21,400
Details on the next Xbox which they say is going the way of Apple and is going to be called simply Xbox.

1121
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:26,400
Loki is shaking his head. What?

1122
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:27,400
This is dumb.

1123
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:32,400
And Sony's brand new TV called TV, it's called the new TV.

1124
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:39,400
Thank you for not making it fucking confusing. We're just going to call it something else anyways.

1125
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:44,400
That's just basically saying, hey, you know what, we just didn't want to market a name that people are going to make fun of.

1126
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:48,400
We're just going to market a name that we already had that people can make fun of or something.

1127
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:55,400
To be fair, it's rumor. We don't know. But anyway, 8 gigs of RAM, quad core processor, it will run Blu-ray discs.

1128
01:17:55,400 --> 01:18:03,400
Supposedly going to have in the future like some type of future add-on would be a head-mounted augmented reality device.

1129
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:08,400
And there will also be a next generation Kinect which I think we all see as kind of a duh.

1130
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:13,400
Anyhow, in a statement, Xbox World editor-in-chief Dan Dawkins said,

1131
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:18,400
Xbox World has been at the cutting edge of Durango coverage for over 12 months.

1132
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:26,400
Unless something really dramatic changes, everything we reveal in our penultimate issue will be revealed long before E3 in June.

1133
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:29,400
That was in an interview with CVG overseas.

1134
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:34,400
So basically they just recap the original leaked rumor thing that, you know.

1135
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:42,400
Yeah, there really isn't a lot here new that wasn't in the rumor except the part about the name and the augmented reality we've sort of heard in different forms.

1136
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:49,400
Because we've talked about that whole projection on the walls. I'm not hearing that here. I'm hearing it's glasses instead.

1137
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,400
It's not going to be glasses.

1138
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:52,400
You don't think, huh?

1139
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:53,400
No.

1140
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:59,400
That would, you'd get into a lot of accessibility issues with glasses. That's why the projection thing made more sense.

1141
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:02,400
That's why 3D TVs aren't popular because you have to buy the glasses.

1142
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:03,400
That's a good point.

1143
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:08,400
And it's just, I don't know. It's just, no.

1144
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:17,400
WhatupG in chat says, at live.vognetwork.com says, next E3 is supposed to be the coming out party for the PS4 slash 720.

1145
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:19,400
You know, that's the assumption we're all making.

1146
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:23,400
And it sounds like, at least in Microsoft's case, that'll be true.

1147
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:27,400
But why is this necessarily true for Sony?

1148
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:32,400
Is there any indication that Sony is really going to debut this or is this wishful thinking on the community's part?

1149
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:36,400
I think it's all wishful thinking. I don't think anyone's going to debut a system next year.

1150
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,400
Oh, you think Microsoft's going to hold off too?

1151
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:44,400
I think that the Wii is not going to do as well. It's not going to take over like the Xbox 360 and the PS3.

1152
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:48,400
So they're just like, eh, why do we have to hurry? There's really no hurry.

1153
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:54,400
Yeah, but the 360 was out before the Wii. So it would not be uncharacteristic of Microsoft to launch.

1154
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:57,400
Right about now is a good, you know, life cycle for them and it makes sense.

1155
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:02,400
Especially if they, quote unquote, beat Sony by a year. Sony's later in the... Sony's...

1156
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:07,400
I guess. I mean, if you look at what they have slated so far, what Microsoft has announced,

1157
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:12,400
they only have first quarter next year that's been announced, or even the first half of next year.

1158
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:17,400
And Sony's kind of similar. They've got a few things that they've announced.

1159
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:22,400
They've got about three or four titles. Those could all be first half of next year, but they haven't really...

1160
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:26,400
I mean, it's a little early to announce the second half because you want to have something for E3 now.

1161
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:34,400
You think the last Office and the... what's that other big one? The one that keeps disappearing at various E3s?

1162
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:35,400
The Last Guardian?

1163
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:40,400
Last Guardian, thank you. There's no way in hell Last Guardian's out before next holiday.

1164
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:47,400
And then on top of that, you still have whatever happened to 13 versus, question mark. We don't know where that is.

1165
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:48,400
Who cares?

1166
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:49,400
I mean, that's third party.

1167
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:50,400
But who cares?

1168
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:58,400
A lot of Final Fantasy fans care. And, like it or not, 14 reborn. That ain't happening until at least summer next year.

1169
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:04,400
So we know there is stuff on the calendar up to the holiday, at least in Sony's department.

1170
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:06,400
So, that's interesting.

1171
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:10,400
Well, I mean, that's not Sony necessarily. That's third party companies.

1172
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:14,400
And obviously you're going to have third parties putting out titles.

1173
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:23,400
Well, that's early part next year. But you still have stuff coming out for a while on there because not everyone is going to pick up.

1174
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:29,400
It's just like the Wii. The Wii is still going to have some stuff coming out. Not anything from Nintendo, but they're going to have a few things.

1175
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:34,400
Interesting comment from Tigerclaw in the chat room. What about the Ouya? You would also have to deal with that when it comes out.

1176
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:42,400
Well, the Ouya is kind of its own little thing. I don't think any of the other guys are taking the Ouya seriously because the Ouya is such a grassroots homebrew thing.

1177
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:48,400
It's like, oh, that little basement, that kid's basement toy. I honestly think that's how they view it.

1178
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:54,400
Because what's the Ouya going to do for the gaming experience? Is it really going to push the gaming experience further?

1179
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:59,400
No, it's just going to open up. It's going to be the most indie friendly thing you've ever seen.

1180
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:05,400
It's just going to be kind of similar to how Steam, because it's kind of the way Steam is trying to go too.

1181
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:09,400
They have the whole Steam Greenlight stuff to try and get your indie games on their marketplace.

1182
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:14,400
And then Steam Big Picture. So they kind of want to sell you a box, which they may eventually do.

1183
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:20,400
They will eventually sell you a box that you hook up to your TV and you just get all the Steam stuff with a controller and away you go.

1184
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:23,400
Which would be fantastic. I don't have a problem with that.

1185
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:30,400
But I think Ouya is trying to do something similar to that where they have got the box that they sell you, which is really tiny, which is awesome.

1186
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:36,400
And then of course all these games are going to be kind of exclusive to it because they're mobile games for the most part.

1187
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:45,400
And you'll just have to see how it takes off. I don't think it's going to be huge. It's not going to all of a sudden just take over the Wii or anything like that.

1188
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:46,400
It's not going to happen.

1189
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:51,400
It'll be like a Roku. A lot of people have them, but not everybody is talking about them.

1190
01:22:51,400 --> 01:23:01,400
Unless, and it's obviously the Wii U doesn't have anything like this, but let's just say that one day they decide,

1191
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:07,400
hey, you know what, we're going to make it so all these games that you buy from us, you can't trade them in anymore.

1192
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:12,400
Or in the next consoles that come out, hey, by the way, all these games are going to be tied to your console.

1193
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,400
Then something like that may be able to take off.

1194
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:19,400
I'm seeing on Twitter that your Nintendo network ID is tied to that console. You can't move it.

1195
01:23:19,400 --> 01:23:27,400
Now, I'm seeing a lot of rage on Twitter about that. I kind of think that's that whole, we just haven't built how to move it yet.

1196
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:33,400
I'm giving Nintendo the benefit of the doubt that they just haven't freaking built that in yet.

1197
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:38,400
Once again, reiterating what we've been saying for months now, they don't fucking get online.

1198
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:42,400
They have something that resembles online right now, but they still don't fucking understand it.

1199
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:45,400
They're making it up as they go along.

1200
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:53,400
That's a real bad, I mean, come on, this is how late into the game are we getting into like an actual functioning online?

1201
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:59,400
And you still haven't figured, I mean, this is this is shit that they were, you know, fucking up years ago.

1202
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:04,400
And now they're just, it's amateur shit.

1203
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:08,400
All right. Dark Soccer, what do you have for us before we get to release dates?

1204
01:24:08,400 --> 01:24:14,400
I have stuff and things. So I'm sure people were interested in Black Ops 2.

1205
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:18,400
Although when one of my friends posted about it as B02, I was like, body odor 2?

1206
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:23,400
Because it's really about as much as I care about Black Ops, but they did something really awesomely stupid.

1207
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:32,400
On the installation disk, it has the data for Mass Effect 2 on it instead.

1208
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:36,400
So they're getting a much better game.

1209
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:40,400
But that means that they can't install Black Ops 2 with the disks.

1210
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:47,400
And they've, but the retail copies come with the Steam key and you can do a digital install and it takes longer.

1211
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:49,400
But you know what?

1212
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:57,400
Now, I heard something, and I don't know if this ended up being true or not, but I heard something about that this was being caused because these people actually...

1213
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,400
Oh, it's PC copies, by the way.

1214
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:09,400
Yeah, these people already had Mass Effect 2 installed on their PCs and Mass Effect 2 had the lock on some type of file extension that Call of Duty was also, or Black Ops was also trying to use.

1215
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:13,400
And so when Black Ops would call up the file, Mass Effect was loading.

1216
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:17,400
Like, it seems like it's only happening to people that already had Mass Effect 2.

1217
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:21,400
At least that's what I'm hearing. I don't know if that panned out or whatever, but I know that was something they were exploring.

1218
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:24,400
Well, it says it happened specifically with the second installation disk.

1219
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:25,400
That's weird.

1220
01:25:25,400 --> 01:25:35,400
Yeah. So, and it's like people on Steam, Reddit, 4chan, although no one listens to 4chan anymore, and the Black Ops forums were complaining about it.

1221
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:45,400
It can also be a pressing issue. They're all duplicated at a few duplicators, and if it just happens that they're pressing copies of Mass Effect 2 and some of those happen to get in there.

1222
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,400
But Activision hasn't said shit about it, so...

1223
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:52,400
Well, which is funny, yeah, because that would mean Activision and EA are using the same presser.

1224
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:59,400
Yeah, they do. I mean, Technicolor, they press disks for the movie industry, for everything.

1225
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:12,400
Yeah, there's only a few duplicators that are out there, and aside from Nintendo actually doing carts and stuff, but these all get duplicated at a few duplicators around the world, and it's just whoever they decide to use.

1226
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:19,400
So yes, it's very possible that they get stuff that maybe another company is using.

1227
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:25,400
Alright, let's travel around the world and look at release dates and see what's coming to a game store near you this week.

1228
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:30,400
Alright, this week we've got, it's starting to slow down a little bit, so we've got a few things.

1229
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:43,400
Rise of the Guardians coming out on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, the Wii, the DS, the 3DS, and yeah.

1230
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:50,400
And then the 3DS version of Pro Evo Soccer 2013, although I think that date's wrong. I believe that's actually coming out next year, if I remember correctly.

1231
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:57,400
Adventure time! Hey Ice King, why'd you steal our garbage? On 3DS and DS, also collector's editions for those.

1232
01:26:57,400 --> 01:27:09,400
Hitman Absolution on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Persona 4 Golden on the Vita, PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale on the PS3 and the Vita.

1233
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:19,400
Also, let's see what else we got here. That is definitely a wrong date. Man, they really need to update their goddamn website.

1234
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:29,400
The Elder Scrolls, let's see, oh and that's not coming out. What else we got here?

1235
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:41,400
Alright, and let's see, we've got Scribblenauts Unlimited on PC, and the PC version came out a little bit later, and everything else.

1236
01:27:41,400 --> 01:27:54,400
And Family Guy, Back to the Multiverse on PS3 and 360, and Kids Learn and Play Pets and Vets. I think that's a re-release.

1237
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,400
The thermometer goes in the butt.

1238
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:08,400
And Assassin's Creed III on PC. What the hell is this, Kids Learn and Play? It's like a bundle, but I haven't ever seen these.

1239
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:13,400
It's some value game. It's crap, don't buy it.

1240
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:22,400
That in-depth review brought to you by Loki. Alright, let's go to the Japanese release dates and what's coming out over there.

1241
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:32,400
On November 22nd on the Xbox 360, Doom 3, the BFG edition, as well as Call of Duty Black Ops 2, this is the version with subtitles, is released in Japan.

1242
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:38,400
There's also an Xbox Live special membership card to celebrate the Call of Duty release in Japan.

1243
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:45,400
On the PlayStation 3, Call of Duty Black Ops 2 is out there as well, same with Doom 3. There's some more stuff though as well.

1244
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:52,400
Some games getting price reductions, Grand Theft Auto 4, Infamous 2, Killzone 3, LittleBigPlanet 2, all of them getting price reductions.

1245
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:59,400
As far as new games go on the PlayStation 3, Mina No Golf 6, EX Troopers, Chaos Head,

1246
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:00,400
That's everybody's golf.

1247
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:07,400
Chaos Head Love Choo Choo, and Chaos Head Noah, as well as a double pack of both games are out there as well.

1248
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:16,400
And Tehayo no Arashi Senkan Yamato Akatsuki ni Shutsugiketsu comes out.

1249
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:21,400
You know what that is? Space Battleship Yamato? In other words, Star Blazers?

1250
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:26,400
Oh, luxury limited edition and regular edition in Japan this week.

1251
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:35,400
And a classic white slim console comes out if you need to get your Japanese PlayStation 3.

1252
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:38,400
Looking at the other systems real quick, let me check on the Vita.

1253
01:29:38,400 --> 01:29:44,400
There's just another 3G Wi-Fi pack out this week that has Mina No Golf 6 with it.

1254
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:46,400
So, there's that, yay.

1255
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:50,400
On the 3DS, EX Troopers is out there as well.

1256
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:57,400
On the 23rd, Pokemon Fushigi no Dungeon, I'm assuming that's the Pokemon Dungeon Crawler game.

1257
01:29:57,400 --> 01:29:59,400
Fushigi is mysterious.

1258
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:03,400
Oh, I keep wanting to say Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon, but it's a Pokemon game.

1259
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:04,400
Pokemon Mysterious Dungeon.

1260
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:06,400
Pikachu's Mysterious Dungeon or whatever.

1261
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:15,400
Ochi Manichi Tamagotchi on the 3DS, because Tamagotchi, yes, is still a thing, believe it or not.

1262
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:20,400
You know, I saw Furbies at Toys R Us the other day, so what's old is new again.

1263
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,400
I blocked Furby on Facebook.

1264
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:28,400
Now, the Wii U, keep in mind, not out over there in Japan until December the 8th,

1265
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:33,400
so we don't have those release dates for a little bit, but we'll work those into the rotation soon.

1266
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:37,400
Otherwise, we'll go to Jamie for what's coming out in the UK.

1267
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:39,400
Some stuff at the end. No, I'm kidding.

1268
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:47,400
On the 18th, Epic Mickey 2, Power of Illusion, and the Power of 2, U-Draw Studio.

1269
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:51,400
On the 20th, we have Hitman Absolution, Planetside, next.

1270
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:54,400
21st, The Walking Dead Episode 5, no time left.

1271
01:30:54,400 --> 01:31:01,400
23rd, Assassin's Creed 3, Rise of the Guardians, Talisman Prologue.

1272
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:03,400
And that's it.

1273
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:08,400
All right, just a few more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

1274
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:10,400
And I think we've got some Sony news.

1275
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:13,400
We've talked Nintendo, we've talked Microsoft, but Loki?

1276
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:18,400
Yeah, they announced already that PlayStation Plus would be coming to the Vita,

1277
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:21,400
and they've now announced which day it's going to be coming out.

1278
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:23,400
It's going to be coming out tomorrow, November 19th.

1279
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:27,400
And what's kind of awesome with that is they're also adding some games to the Instant Game collection

1280
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:29,400
that will be available for the Vita.

1281
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:35,400
And this includes some full Vita games, including Uncharted Golden Abyss,

1282
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:39,400
Jet Set Radio, which is actually set to come out next week,

1283
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:45,400
Wipeout 2048, Gravity Rush, Tales from Space, Mutant Blobs Attack,

1284
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:50,400
and I guess Final Fantasy Tactics, The War of Lions, that was a PSP title.

1285
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:53,400
And not bad.

1286
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:56,400
And of course, PlayStation Plus, 18 bucks for three months,

1287
01:31:56,400 --> 01:31:59,400
or 50 bucks for the full year.

1288
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:03,400
And I guess obviously if you have a PlayStation Plus membership,

1289
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:08,400
you also get all the free wonderful games library stuff with the PS3,

1290
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:12,400
and the one gigabyte of cloud storage, which is pretty awesome.

1291
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:14,400
And I guess a gigabyte of cloud storage on the Vita.

1292
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:16,400
I wonder if that's the same one gigabyte.

1293
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:19,400
Is your Vita actually going to come out of storage now at this point?

1294
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:21,400
Well, it's in my backpack.

1295
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:23,400
Is it going to come out of your backpack?

1296
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:27,400
No, because I have to actually become a member of PlayStation Plus,

1297
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:29,400
and I just don't want to right now.

1298
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:32,400
I'm excited. I'm PlayStation Plus, and I couldn't be more excited about this.

1299
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:35,400
I'm like, oh my god, it's like Christmas on my Vita tomorrow.

1300
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:38,400
It's going to be great. So yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

1301
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:40,400
Vita's relevance is finally starting to come out.

1302
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:41,400
Hooray!

1303
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:43,400
Just in time for the holidays.

1304
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:45,400
All right, well, also coming to the Vita,

1305
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:49,400
I think this is also tomorrow with the PlayStation Plus update,

1306
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:55,400
obviously a whole new firmware 2.0, a new email application for the Vita.

1307
01:32:55,400 --> 01:32:58,400
It's kind of interesting, but well, it makes the 3G a little more lucrative,

1308
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:00,400
especially if you don't have a phone that does it.

1309
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:04,400
With the coolest PlayStation's typing interface.

1310
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:08,400
I get what they're doing, but no.

1311
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:11,400
It's easier to use than iPhone, honestly. I think so.

1312
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:13,400
On the Vita? Heck yeah.

1313
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:19,400
It's easier to have the key directly instead of having to memorize what it's under.

1314
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:22,400
The Vita has that tanky style mode.

1315
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:28,400
You can type on the keyboard, and it's really responsive and fits a large part of the screen.

1316
01:33:28,400 --> 01:33:29,400
Oh, the Vita is a touch screen, isn't it?

1317
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:30,400
Hello!

1318
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:31,400
Okay, disregard, sorry.

1319
01:33:31,400 --> 01:33:34,400
You're thinking about Sony's PlayStation 3 predictive text,

1320
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:37,400
which the Vita will do as well, so it has that.

1321
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:39,400
I'll be over here if you need me.

1322
01:33:39,400 --> 01:33:48,400
That's alright. Gmail, Yahoo, and other miscellaneous providers unsaid will be supported.

1323
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:51,400
Also, finally, this is so dumb that they didn't have this before.

1324
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:55,400
Wirelessly transmit between the PC and the Vita.

1325
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:59,400
Also, browser and video apps will now do 1080p videos,

1326
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:02,400
even though it's not like it's going to magically change the output.

1327
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:05,400
What about wirelessly transmitting between the PS3 and the Vita?

1328
01:34:05,400 --> 01:34:10,400
That's not said, but I would think if it's wireless between the PC, why not?

1329
01:34:10,400 --> 01:34:12,400
Yeah, I think it would be on the PlayStation 3.

1330
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:15,400
I want to say I read that somewhere else, that it will do that too.

1331
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:16,400
Thank God.

1332
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:18,400
It makes so much more sense.

1333
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:20,400
So, very cool.

1334
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:23,400
That's all coming as well this week.

1335
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:26,400
Alright, let's go back to a time when games were a lot simpler,

1336
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,400
and you didn't have all this firmware.

1337
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:30,400
You got your cartridge, and you liked it.

1338
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,400
That was firmware.

1339
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:35,400
You dropped it, and it still worked. That was firmware.

1340
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:40,400
You flushed a cartridge in the toilet, and it still worked.

1341
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:46,400
It is the classic game of the week, and I believe Dark Sakura is taking it back this week.

1342
01:34:46,400 --> 01:34:47,400
I am.

1343
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:52,400
The game of the week is Yars' Revenge for the Atari 2600.

1344
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:55,400
Yars, not Yaris.

1345
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:57,400
This is a great pick, just so you know.

1346
01:34:57,400 --> 01:35:03,400
It's also a game that particularly illustrates the proper way to use an apostrophe with something that ends in an S.

1347
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:09,400
Although, to be honest, if they were ever going to make a second Yars game, Yars' Revenge would be kind of funny.

1348
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:14,400
It would be like Christine, you know, words that end with an S.

1349
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:16,400
Anyway.

1350
01:35:16,400 --> 01:35:25,400
Anyway, it came out in 1982, and it was created by Howard Scott Warshall, who wrote Raiders of the Lost Ark and E.T.

1351
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:27,400
But we forgive him because of Yars' Revenge.

1352
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:31,400
That's right. For every bad game he made, there was a good game.

1353
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:34,400
And let's not forget, he was under tremendous pressure with E.T.

1354
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:37,400
Read his side of it. You'll feel a lot of sympathy for the guy.

1355
01:35:37,400 --> 01:35:42,400
Which isn't that like the plot of the Angry Video Game Nerds movie now?

1356
01:35:42,400 --> 01:35:45,400
Trying to find where all the cartridges of E.T. are?

1357
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:47,400
Who cares? I care about the real story. No offense.

1358
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:52,400
Well, anyway, it was supposed to be a licensed port of the game called Star Castle.

1359
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:57,400
Which, there's a cannon that's protected by these counter-rotating shields.

1360
01:35:57,400 --> 01:36:01,400
And you have to shoot holes in the shields to destroy the cannon inside.

1361
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:04,400
But then again, once you shoot the holes, the cannon can shoot you.

1362
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:06,400
So, um...

1363
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,400
Kill or be killed.

1364
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:10,400
Anyway.

1365
01:36:10,400 --> 01:36:15,400
So, as they were developing the Atari version, it actually changed quite a bit.

1366
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:21,400
So now your hero is called a Yar, which is like a little insect thing that nibbles through the lair.

1367
01:36:21,400 --> 01:36:27,400
And then it can shoot his cannon into the breach and kill the evil Kotyle.

1368
01:36:27,400 --> 01:36:29,400
Which I think is how it was said.

1369
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:31,400
Um, who was on the side of the barrier.

1370
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:36,400
Although you can be shot at through the barrier.

1371
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:38,400
And, uh...

1372
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:40,400
And it, uh...

1373
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:42,400
And it turns into a swirl.

1374
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:45,400
However, you're warned before you get shot at.

1375
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:48,400
And you can go back to the other side of the little energy wall.

1376
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:53,400
Which, I swear the first time I saw that I was like, is my TV fucked up?

1377
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:55,400
But no. It's a party game.

1378
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:57,400
Um, it's also a little safe zone.

1379
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:59,400
The neutral zone.

1380
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:01,400
Um, the swirls can get you, but the little torpedoes cannot.

1381
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:04,400
And you cannot shoot from within the neutral zone.

1382
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:07,400
So, um, you've got different scoring.

1383
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:15,400
And if you, like, the highest thing you can get is if you shoot one of those swirls in mid-air with the Zorlon cannon.

1384
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:17,400
Which is this little shooty thing.

1385
01:37:17,400 --> 01:37:22,400
You get 6,000 points and an extra life that you can get only up to nine lives.

1386
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:27,400
And each level ends, um, when you kill the Kotyle or the swirl.

1387
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:33,400
So, uh, basically when you reach 70,000 points the shield will turn blue.

1388
01:37:33,400 --> 01:37:36,400
And the swirls come out with more frequency.

1389
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:39,400
If you get 150,000, the shield turns gray.

1390
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:42,400
And, you know, even more crap comes up.

1391
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,400
And you get a guided missile.

1392
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:45,400
It's gonna get ya.

1393
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:53,400
230,000 points, the shield turns pink, and the swirls will begin to fire three, um, times more frequently.

1394
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:55,400
And not give you warnings.

1395
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:57,400
There was a comic book that came out with it.

1396
01:37:57,400 --> 01:38:01,400
Had a mini comic book, um, that, uh, was at the game package.

1397
01:38:01,400 --> 01:38:10,400
And it gave the story behind the game and why it was seeking vengeance because apparently the thingy blew up their world.

1398
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:16,400
And then there was an album that had a theme song and a radio drama of the comic book.

1399
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:18,400
So that was kind of neat.

1400
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:27,400
There's also an easter egg in the game that if you kill a swirl in mid-air, a black vertical line appears on the screen across the spot where the swirl was shot.

1401
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:33,400
And the line is referred to in the manual as Ghost of Yars and warns the player to stay off the mean streak.

1402
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:40,400
If the player moves vertically along that line and is about one to two inches below the middle of the screen when the explosion closes,

1403
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:48,400
the game will end and go into a game select screen with the programmer's initials HSW, um, that's forward and backwards on the word select.

1404
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:54,400
Um, if you do it in game six or seven, JOV appears, which is under the player's initials.

1405
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:59,400
There's a remake, um, for the, uh, Game Boy Color in 1999.

1406
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:03,400
In 2005, of course, it came out on the Atari Flashback II.

1407
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:06,400
There's a three in one that came on the GBA in 2005.

1408
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:09,400
And, um, that also came with Pong and Asteroids.

1409
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:12,400
It's available in Game Room in 2010.

1410
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:15,400
There's a reimagining that came out on Xbox Live Arcade.

1411
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:22,400
Um, and, uh, actually I think it's not out yet on PS3. They said they were gonna be doing it.

1412
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:25,400
I don't know if it ever did come out on PS3. I don't remember.

1413
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:29,400
I checked it out on 360 and I was like, it is nothing like this.

1414
01:39:29,400 --> 01:39:32,400
Well, now the Yar is a chick with power armor.

1415
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:42,400
And then there's another remake that's a prequel that's called Yar's Revenge First War that, um, was part of the Atari Go deal on April 8th, 2011 on Facebook.

1416
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:47,400
And, uh, it's supposed to be a lot more like the 2600 game. I haven't played it.

1417
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:53,400
And there's another one that's free on browsers that supports HTML5 that is on Atari.com.

1418
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:55,400
There's other classic Atari games.

1419
01:39:55,400 --> 01:40:00,400
And, um, there's a sequel called Yar's Return that's on the Atari Flashback II.

1420
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,400
The end.

1421
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:06,400
There it is, your classic game of the week. A real classic going way back to the Atari 2600.

1422
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:11,400
Yar's Revenge. Undoubtedly one of the best 2600 games they ever did.

1423
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:12,400
Absolutely.

1424
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:15,400
Alright, well we are going to take a break, guys, when we come back.

1425
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:19,400
We've got more of Orange Lounge Radio to come, including rapid fire, uh, news.

1426
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:22,400
The Fubo Question of the Week, uh, some other gaming related news.

1427
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:29,400
And a hilarious follow up to something I said next week, or I said last week, would probably not go away.

1428
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:30,400
The Futures!

1429
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:33,400
It's really funny. We'll get to that in just a little bit.

1430
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:36,400
When we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1431
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:46,400
Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.

1432
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:53,400
Live with episode number 482 of our show for this November the 18th of 2012.

1433
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:57,400
We're going to get into some rapid fire news, but first, I gotta ask Loki.

1434
01:40:57,400 --> 01:41:02,400
Loki's over there. He's like, alright, let me touch the Wii U tablet.

1435
01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:04,400
He's gonna touch the Wii.

1436
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:06,400
Alright, alright, Loki, touch the Wii U tablet.

1437
01:41:06,400 --> 01:41:14,400
I, I like it. I think it has a good, for such a big frickin' thing, it's, it's got a really nice feel to it.

1438
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:22,400
It's, I mean, as far as the placements of the analog sticks, they're comfortable, but hitting, like, the buttons below it is not quite comfortable.

1439
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:34,400
It, like, if you're trying to hit the A, like, the A button, if there was a game that you were using, you know, like, first person shooters and stuff, where the A button might be used, that is a bit, you know, that could cramp up your hand pretty bad.

1440
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:47,400
You know what's strange about that is that from that, that's, I felt that, wow, words, yes, I felt that in the menus that, and I think this might be more related to the Xbox 360 controller since they just flipped where the buttons are.

1441
01:41:47,400 --> 01:41:54,400
I kinda noticed that problem in the menus, but the little, the couple of games that I was playing through didn't really have finger placement issues.

1442
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:56,400
I don't know.

1443
01:41:56,400 --> 01:42:08,400
Well, if you wanna follow me on Miiverse, again, I said this quickly here in the first part of the show, but if you did pick up a Wii U and you wanna follow me on Miiverse, my name on the Wii, really creative, y'all, Rob Roberts, all one word.

1444
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:10,400
I know, really tough to figure out.

1445
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:19,400
Alright, let's, uh, travel, uh, through some rapid fire news and talk quickly about what else is going on in the gaming world, not just a Wii.

1446
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:29,400
There's StarCraft II, Heart of the Swarm, which is the next expansion for StarCraft II, and it should be coming out March 12th.

1447
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:35,400
It was originally kind of alluded to or leaked out on Battle.net, and of course, they confirmed.

1448
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:37,400
That'll be out March 12th.

1449
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:48,400
It'll be released individually at $39.99, and of course, Digital Deluxe and Collector's Edition version will be available as well, priced at $59.99 and $79.99 respectively.

1450
01:42:49,400 --> 01:43:00,400
And the Digital Deluxe version, like anything else that is Blizzard, will contain stuff that, you know, doesn't necessarily apply to the game that you're buying, which doesn't make any fucking sense to me.

1451
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:08,400
You get a pet for World of Warcraft and a new sigil for Diablo III, and, um, and yeah.

1452
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:16,400
Why, someone explain this to me, why the fuck would I buy a Collector's Edition for one game to get shit for another game? That doesn't make any goddamn sense.

1453
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:19,400
Because you're already playing the other game, especially WoW.

1454
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:29,400
There's a lot of Blizzard crossover in the fandom. I would say there's more synergy within that fandom than almost any other type of company, with the exception of maybe Squeenix.

1455
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:30,400
And you actually can-

1456
01:43:30,400 --> 01:43:32,400
Before pre-IDOS.

1457
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:34,400
And you can get StarCraft pets in WoW.

1458
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:40,400
Yeah, there's a lot of that crossover, but sigils, really, really-

1459
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:42,400
That's a bit of a stretch.

1460
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:43,400
Really.

1461
01:43:43,400 --> 01:43:45,400
But what else are they gonna give you, a friggin' legendary drop?

1462
01:43:45,400 --> 01:43:57,400
I don't know, I mean, it's just kinda dumb that they have that. Behind the scenes DVD slash Blu-Ray, and a soundtrack, also a Heart of the Swarm hardcover art book, and a Zerg Rush mousepad.

1463
01:43:57,400 --> 01:43:58,400
Key, key, key, key, key.

1464
01:43:58,400 --> 01:44:10,400
Let me put it this way, okay? Rational people out there, just don't fucking buy the Collector's Edition. You don't need to spend $40 extra for a pet in WoW and a goddamn mousepad.

1465
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:17,400
It's not, just, resist. You can do it. I mean, seriously, it's just kinda-

1466
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:20,400
But if you are an addict and bought it, give me the pet.

1467
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:25,400
I would be glad to give you mine, because otherwise the code will be completely unredeemed.

1468
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:26,400
Okay.

1469
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:29,400
Do you have the one from the original StarCraft II release?

1470
01:44:29,400 --> 01:44:30,400
No, I do not.

1471
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:32,400
Okay, I will send that your way when I get home.

1472
01:44:32,400 --> 01:44:35,400
Yes! So I win, I win, Rob, you can't have it.

1473
01:44:35,400 --> 01:44:38,400
Sorry, you're making food and not in the room. Disqualified.

1474
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:44,400
So PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale comes out next week, and they've already announced their first bit of DLC.

1475
01:44:44,400 --> 01:44:51,400
What? Early DLC? What the fuck? Why? I'm not paying for DLC. Well, good, you don't have to, because it's actually free.

1476
01:44:51,400 --> 01:45:05,400
And the two characters they're going to be adding to the roster include Kat, who is from Gravity Rush, the Vita game, and I guess Emmett Graves, who is the character from Starhawk.

1477
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:12,400
And what's kind of cool is apparently the unique gameplay styles from both of those games are going to cross over into it,

1478
01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:26,400
including Kat's ability to manipulate gravity and Emmett's ability to kind of call the support stuff from Starhawk, the build-as-you-kind-of-go type thing.

1479
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:32,400
So that's pretty neat, and free DLC is always awesome, and it's kind of cool to see if they're going to be expanding this game.

1480
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:41,400
Maybe when the Game of the Year edition comes out with all the characters in there, they may consider picking it up, but still pretty neat.

1481
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:49,400
And last but not least, and I've actually used this company before, Fingerprints is actually doing something now with Minecraft,

1482
01:45:49,400 --> 01:45:59,400
where you can actually export a part of your world and have it printed in 3D. That's right, your own Minecraft world creations in 3D.

1483
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:11,400
And you just have to download the app that's on the Fingerprints website, just fingerprints.com slash Minecraft, and you can go check it out.

1484
01:46:11,400 --> 01:46:20,400
And I guess the prices vary depending on the size of your model that you're having printed, and they kind of give some examples, and they're pretty cool looking.

1485
01:46:20,400 --> 01:46:32,400
I had gotten one from my Xbox 360 avatar, so I actually have a 3D avatar of myself at my desk, which is pretty awesome.

1486
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:39,400
But yeah, it doesn't really say how much it would cost for your creations.

1487
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:45,400
There would be some cool stuff I'd want to make from our world, but I have to see how much this is.

1488
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:54,400
Looks like it may only be one chunk. I'm thinking it might be one chunk, but neat! Kind of cool.

1489
01:46:54,400 --> 01:47:06,400
Looks cool. Moving on, Classic Dragon Quest fans will rejoice in the news that the Heartbeat Studio that originally developed the games in the Super Nintendo and PS1 games,

1490
01:47:06,400 --> 01:47:12,400
that closed shortly thereafter, is up for a revival as the Genius Sonority.

1491
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:18,400
They previously worked on Pokemon Colosseum, Dragon Quest Swords, and the Dinpamen, they came by wave.

1492
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:27,400
Manaba Yamana revealed by Twitter that Heartbeat will be relaunched after a decade, starting early next year with a new business perspective.

1493
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:33,400
According to Inside Games, Yamana said to expect a new webpage with more information next year.

1494
01:47:33,400 --> 01:47:37,400
Can only imagine what their debut title is going to be.

1495
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:47,400
Origin has been hit by a series of security breaches as users come to find out their accounts have been cracked and personal details have been leaked.

1496
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:53,400
Sigh. To make matters worse, EA's own security measures ensure victims aren't resolving the issue.

1497
01:47:53,400 --> 01:48:01,400
Because it's so unable to log back in, change your email address back, change your password, certain things along those lines.

1498
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:06,400
Users affected by the attack are told that their email address is invalid whenever they try to log in,

1499
01:48:06,400 --> 01:48:13,400
and as soon as they call EA to find out what's wrong, they get shut down by representatives who can't help them without a receipt and valid date of birth.

1500
01:48:13,400 --> 01:48:16,400
S.M.H.

1501
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:20,400
Yes, with a valid date of birth, the course is being changed by said hacker.

1502
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:28,400
Because, you know, that has to be something that'll change, because you will mysteriously be born at a different date than you once were.

1503
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:30,400
God bless web development.

1504
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:36,400
NeoGaf has managed to compile tens of thousands of threads, well that wouldn't surprise me,

1505
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:44,400
ten threads of complaints on EA's official forums and just a sample of the overall total of grief being expunged on the internet.

1506
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:52,400
If you use Origin, do your due diligence, unique password, make sure all your stuff is correct so you at least have a remote chance of getting back into your account.

1507
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:54,400
Be internet safe.

1508
01:48:54,400 --> 01:49:01,400
Since you brought up NeoGaf, I don't visit that site an awful lot because it's a little too busy and I have too much, like, ADD,

1509
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:07,400
but there was, like, the most winning thread I've ever seen on a web forum was on NeoGaf this week,

1510
01:49:07,400 --> 01:49:16,400
and it had to do with photoshopping your favorite, or no, a descriptive, animated gif as the box art for a game.

1511
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:22,400
Like, I'm describing this and I'm doing a terrible job, but like there was this great, like somebody photoshopped a box art for Tokyo Jungle,

1512
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:27,400
and it was like these two kiddies in a dog hall wrestling, and it was really funny, like there was all this kind of stuff.

1513
01:49:27,400 --> 01:49:35,400
Grand Theft Auto 5 with a cop taking some guy out, it's like all these great animated gifs from around the internet on video game box art.

1514
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:39,400
That's absolutely nothing to do with what you just talked about, but I like gifs.

1515
01:49:39,400 --> 01:49:41,400
Who doesn't?

1516
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:45,400
And two days ago was officially Miyamoto's 60th birthday.

1517
01:49:45,400 --> 01:49:48,400
Not too much need to be said for a man like him.

1518
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:59,400
Imagine how the state of games would be different had Shigeru Miyamoto and Nintendo and the entire uprising that has happened on the last three decades not actually occurred.

1519
01:49:59,400 --> 01:50:02,400
Uprising? Bad choice of words.

1520
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:04,400
Up checking.

1521
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:08,400
In some cases, like, the value Wii games, I suppose.

1522
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:10,400
How about Oother News?

1523
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:11,400
Oother News?

1524
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:18,400
Tom Hardy is going to be playing the lead in Splinter Cell for the movie version, Sam Fisher.

1525
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:19,400
Good.

1526
01:50:19,400 --> 01:50:27,400
However, he's also slated to join Michael Fassbender in an Assassin's Creed film, so.

1527
01:50:27,400 --> 01:50:31,400
Also, God, as if this wasn't enough.

1528
01:50:31,400 --> 01:50:34,400
Who remembers Barkley Shut Up and Jam?

1529
01:50:34,400 --> 01:50:43,400
Well, the group that did Barkley Shut Up and Jam Gaiden, the sequel that was all completely parody, have a new Kickstarter up to make a game called

1530
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:53,400
Magical Realms of Tyran Anog, Escape from Necron 7, Revenge of Cocolon, the official game of the movie chapter 2 of the Hoops Barkley saga.

1531
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:54,400
That's awesome.

1532
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:57,400
And then Jet Set Radio Vita will be out November 20th.

1533
01:50:57,400 --> 01:51:03,400
And a mobile version will be out in 90s after for iOS and Android. The end.

1534
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:06,400
Let's get to the foogle question of the week.

1535
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:17,400
Take Facebook and Google Plus. Yes, people are on Google Plus.

1536
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:19,400
And slam them together and you get foogle.

1537
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:22,400
Make them do it. Make them have retarded babies.

1538
01:51:23,400 --> 01:51:26,400
What? Foogle.

1539
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:28,400
Foogle. Go foogle yourself.

1540
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:35,400
Alright, every week we ask a question on our foogle communities and we get answers.

1541
01:51:35,400 --> 01:51:38,400
And we read some of our favorite answers on the show.

1542
01:51:38,400 --> 01:51:44,400
We have a lot of responses this week because I actually planned ahead this week and asked the question a whole day early.

1543
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:47,400
So you're very welcome that we get more participation this week.

1544
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:54,400
Very controversial article going around the internet this week because, you know, how else do you get hits for your website?

1545
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:55,400
Stir up some controversy.

1546
01:51:55,400 --> 01:52:00,400
Like determining the all time 100 best video games.

1547
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:06,400
Now usually I wouldn't give two shits about a list like this because everybody's got one on their site, whatever.

1548
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:08,400
But it's Time Magazine's website.

1549
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:13,400
And so I go, okay, well Time Magazine, that's a magazine that's been around, you know, a little while.

1550
01:52:13,400 --> 01:52:17,400
And has a big reputation as like a news magazine.

1551
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:20,400
It's in every dentist's office in the country. You've seen Time Magazine at some point.

1552
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:25,400
So they put up their list of the all time best of the best 100 video games.

1553
01:52:25,400 --> 01:52:28,400
Now I don't have time to read the entire list here.

1554
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:32,400
But just to give you an idea of some of the things they named.

1555
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:35,400
The Oregon Trail was on there.

1556
01:52:35,400 --> 01:52:38,400
Mass Effect 3 was on there.

1557
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:40,400
Yay!

1558
01:52:41,400 --> 01:52:48,400
When I looked at the list, I saw it as a little more like, these are influential games.

1559
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:53,400
Not necessarily the best games, but games that like were felt.

1560
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:58,400
And there's only two games from this decade on the entire list.

1561
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:00,400
From the 2010s.

1562
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:02,400
Mass Effect 3 and Batman Arkham City.

1563
01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:04,400
Which, well, Batman Arkham City was a pretty fucking great game too.

1564
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:06,400
Bad citizens are both pretty worthy.

1565
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:08,400
Both pretty worthy.

1566
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:10,400
The oldest games on the list from the 1970s.

1567
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:12,400
The Oregon Trail.

1568
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:14,400
Hunt the Wumpus.

1569
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:16,400
Does anyone remember that? I actually remember the Wumpus game.

1570
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:18,400
Pong.

1571
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:20,400
Breakout.

1572
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:22,400
Space Invaders.

1573
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:24,400
Adventure.

1574
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:26,400
And Asteroids.

1575
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:28,400
But some people are having issues with this list.

1576
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:30,400
Because they only would do one game from a series.

1577
01:53:30,400 --> 01:53:34,400
So I think they did the original Zelda.

1578
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:36,400
The original Mega Man.

1579
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:40,400
They did Metroid, but not like any of the follow-up games.

1580
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:42,400
No Guardian Legend.

1581
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:44,400
They did Final Fantasy VII, and yes, no Guardian Legend.

1582
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:46,400
Bastards!

1583
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:48,400
They picked VII, that is amazing justification.

1584
01:53:48,400 --> 01:53:50,400
I can see, I can see.

1585
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:54,400
Well look, we asked you guys on Google Plus and on Facebook.

1586
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:56,400
We're sure many of you saw this list.

1587
01:53:56,400 --> 01:53:58,400
What was your impression of the list?

1588
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:04,400
Being that time is more of a news organization than something that typically caters to entertainment.

1589
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:06,400
Were there any glaring omissions or issues?

1590
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:10,400
So here's some of the answers from Google Plus.

1591
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:12,400
Kevin R. replied and said,

1592
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:16,400
I think Wii Sports should not be on this list.

1593
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:20,400
What about cult followings like Disgaea and .hack and Persona?

1594
01:54:20,400 --> 01:54:24,400
Let's see some that are not for the mainstream.

1595
01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:28,400
Kevin, I'm totally with you on the second half, but Wii Sports not being on the list?

1596
01:54:28,400 --> 01:54:30,400
Well here's the thing.

1597
01:54:30,400 --> 01:54:34,400
The fact that it's Time magazine is why Wii Sports is on the list.

1598
01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:36,400
This was not EGM or some like game.

1599
01:54:36,400 --> 01:54:42,400
You have to remember, Wii Sports broke the mainstream in a way very few video games have.

1600
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:44,400
It is the top selling video game ever.

1601
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:46,400
Am I not right?

1602
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:48,400
100% agree.

1603
01:54:48,400 --> 01:54:52,400
Very unfortunate for us and what we do, our feelings and what we say, but

1604
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:56,400
Wii Sports is the number one reason why, as you said before,

1605
01:54:57,400 --> 01:55:00,400
the Wii was such a runaway sale, period.

1606
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:06,400
But I get it. I'm not here to argue with listeners who are commenting on Google for the first time.

1607
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:08,400
I'm not doing that.

1608
01:55:08,400 --> 01:55:10,400
But I'm just saying, think about it this way.

1609
01:55:10,400 --> 01:55:12,400
Because even though as a gamer you might be like,

1610
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:15,400
there really isn't much of a game here. I'm just flailing about here.

1611
01:55:15,400 --> 01:55:17,400
Only Wii bowling counts.

1612
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:20,400
That flailing sold a hell of a lot of systems.

1613
01:55:21,400 --> 01:55:23,400
Elliot B says,

1614
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:36,400
You know, Portal 2 I'll give you.

1615
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:38,400
Minecraft, vomit.

1616
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:40,400
Until someone buys me a copy.

1617
01:55:40,400 --> 01:55:44,400
I'm sorry, but your opinion doesn't count on Minecraft.

1618
01:55:44,400 --> 01:55:48,400
I know that sounds harsh, but I'm sorry.

1619
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:50,400
Here's the thing I do want to say to be fair.

1620
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:52,400
Portal 1 is on the list.

1621
01:55:52,400 --> 01:55:54,400
And so they did the whole No Sequels thing.

1622
01:55:54,400 --> 01:55:58,400
So I'm okay with Portal 1 topping Portal 2.

1623
01:55:58,400 --> 01:56:00,400
Minecraft.

1624
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:04,400
I think that's one of those, let it age like a wine.

1625
01:56:04,400 --> 01:56:06,400
I think in five more years,

1626
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:11,400
I think we haven't really felt Minecraft's influence yet.

1627
01:56:11,400 --> 01:56:14,400
Batman Arkham City and Minecraft 3,

1628
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:20,400
Mass Effect 3, were final games in long running series.

1629
01:56:20,400 --> 01:56:22,400
Or the latest games in long running series.

1630
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:24,400
They had a little different battle to that list.

1631
01:56:24,400 --> 01:56:26,400
So, hmm.

1632
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:28,400
Let's see.

1633
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:30,400
Robert G picked up on something.

1634
01:56:30,400 --> 01:56:33,400
It was a good list, but it had some editing problems.

1635
01:56:33,400 --> 01:56:37,400
Atari's adventure screenshot was not from the actual game.

1636
01:56:37,400 --> 01:56:39,400
I have to see if that is...

1637
01:56:41,400 --> 01:56:43,400
Is that not from the game?

1638
01:56:43,400 --> 01:56:45,400
I'm trying to look at it.

1639
01:56:45,400 --> 01:56:47,400
I guess maybe not.

1640
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:49,400
It looks like a game screenshot,

1641
01:56:49,400 --> 01:56:51,400
but I'm thinking, when do you take the red dragon there?

1642
01:56:51,400 --> 01:56:53,400
Weren't they all in front of little castles?

1643
01:56:53,400 --> 01:56:55,400
Or could you move them around?

1644
01:56:55,400 --> 01:56:57,400
I think someone Googled that and said,

1645
01:56:57,400 --> 01:56:59,400
let's use this one.

1646
01:56:59,400 --> 01:57:01,400
Probably.

1647
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:03,400
It could have been a hacked image or something like that.

1648
01:57:03,400 --> 01:57:05,400
Maybe.

1649
01:57:05,400 --> 01:57:07,400
We could have found a better one.

1650
01:57:07,400 --> 01:57:09,400
It's like when you go to the movie

1651
01:57:09,400 --> 01:57:11,400
and the trailer isn't in the movie.

1652
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:13,400
Which happens all the time.

1653
01:57:13,400 --> 01:57:15,400
It happens all the time now.

1654
01:57:15,400 --> 01:57:17,400
That was a big thing in TV commercials for a while, too.

1655
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:19,400
Yeah, TV commercials for shows.

1656
01:57:19,400 --> 01:57:21,400
All the time.

1657
01:57:21,400 --> 01:57:23,400
That was some of the answers from Google+.

1658
01:57:23,400 --> 01:57:25,400
I'm sorry I didn't read them all,

1659
01:57:25,400 --> 01:57:27,400
but there's some good stuff there,

1660
01:57:27,400 --> 01:57:29,400
so I hope you will check them out.

1661
01:57:29,400 --> 01:57:31,400
Let me read some of the answers from Facebook.

1662
01:57:31,400 --> 01:57:33,400
Critical Myth, also on the VOG Network,

1663
01:57:33,400 --> 01:57:35,400
replies, starting off,

1664
01:57:35,400 --> 01:57:37,400
it was a nice walk through gaming nostalgia,

1665
01:57:37,400 --> 01:57:39,400
could possibly take our subjective likes and dislikes

1666
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:41,400
and personal histories into account

1667
01:57:41,400 --> 01:57:43,400
to match our expectations or preferences.

1668
01:57:43,400 --> 01:57:45,400
A very good reminder.

1669
01:57:45,400 --> 01:57:47,400
But hey,

1670
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:49,400
we still have to argue about it anyway, right?

1671
01:57:49,400 --> 01:57:51,400
Tiara,

1672
01:57:51,400 --> 01:57:53,400
our good buddy Tiara from Geek-Life.com

1673
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:55,400
replies and says,

1674
01:57:55,400 --> 01:57:57,400
don't get me wrong,

1675
01:57:57,400 --> 01:57:59,400
Final Fantasy Tactics is one of my favorite games,

1676
01:57:59,400 --> 01:58:01,400
but how did that make it on the list?

1677
01:58:01,400 --> 01:58:03,400
But Final Fantasy IV and VI didn't.

1678
01:58:03,400 --> 01:58:05,400
Overall, a lot of good choices,

1679
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:07,400
but some questionable ones as well.

1680
01:58:07,400 --> 01:58:09,400
Well, Tiara, I'm pretty sure IV and VI

1681
01:58:09,400 --> 01:58:11,400
didn't make the list because VII did.

1682
01:58:11,400 --> 01:58:13,400
And now we're gonna go back

1683
01:58:13,400 --> 01:58:15,400
and have that old argument

1684
01:58:15,400 --> 01:58:17,400
about Final Fantasy VII,

1685
01:58:17,400 --> 01:58:19,400
so I'll just let that be.

1686
01:58:19,400 --> 01:58:21,400
Interesting that they did jump.

1687
01:58:21,400 --> 01:58:23,400
Not that the Final Fantasy universe

1688
01:58:23,400 --> 01:58:25,400
was canonical

1689
01:58:25,400 --> 01:58:27,400
from release to release,

1690
01:58:27,400 --> 01:58:29,400
but interesting that they would jump out to Tactics

1691
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:31,400
in addition to VII.

1692
01:58:31,400 --> 01:58:33,400
Tactics, though, is a completely

1693
01:58:33,400 --> 01:58:35,400
different type of game.

1694
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:37,400
And I think the argument I was going for

1695
01:58:37,400 --> 01:58:39,400
would be like

1696
01:58:39,400 --> 01:58:41,400
modern Mega Man games,

1697
01:58:41,400 --> 01:58:43,400
like Battle Network, not that I would put them

1698
01:58:43,400 --> 01:58:45,400
in a candidate for top 100, but just saying

1699
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:47,400
the fact that there are a lot of Mega Man spinoffs

1700
01:58:47,400 --> 01:58:49,400
with completely different play style and whatnot.

1701
01:58:49,400 --> 01:58:51,400
How many other RTSs are in there?

1702
01:58:51,400 --> 01:58:53,400
Like, did they do Breath of Fire?

1703
01:58:53,400 --> 01:58:55,400
It's a big list.

1704
01:58:55,400 --> 01:58:57,400
It's a page list.

1705
01:58:57,400 --> 01:58:59,400
Well, I have a quesadilla in my mouth.

1706
01:58:59,400 --> 01:59:01,400
I'm just using it as an example.

1707
01:59:01,400 --> 01:59:03,400
Did they do Tactics Ogre,

1708
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:05,400
or anything that was that same style

1709
01:59:05,400 --> 01:59:07,400
of gameplay?

1710
01:59:07,400 --> 01:59:09,400
Final Fantasy Tactics really, I think, took out

1711
01:59:09,400 --> 01:59:11,400
something that was an

1712
01:59:11,400 --> 01:59:13,400
almost niche,

1713
01:59:13,400 --> 01:59:15,400
just slightly outside the niche level,

1714
01:59:15,400 --> 01:59:17,400
and really brought it into

1715
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:19,400
mainstream, because it was a big

1716
01:59:19,400 --> 01:59:21,400
name that everyone recognized.

1717
01:59:21,400 --> 01:59:23,400
I'm scanning this list real quick

1718
01:59:23,400 --> 01:59:25,400
trying to look for tactical games.

1719
01:59:25,400 --> 01:59:27,400
Desktop Tower Defense,

1720
01:59:27,400 --> 01:59:29,400
I don't even know what that game is.

1721
01:59:29,400 --> 01:59:31,400
That would be tactical.

1722
01:59:31,400 --> 01:59:33,400
It's Tower Defense.

1723
01:59:33,400 --> 01:59:35,400
That's about all you have to say.

1724
01:59:35,400 --> 01:59:37,400
Well, but

1725
01:59:37,400 --> 01:59:39,400
look at all the fucking Tower Defense games

1726
01:59:39,400 --> 01:59:41,400
we have now. That's a huge part of IOS.

1727
01:59:41,400 --> 01:59:43,400
No, I agree with it on the list.

1728
01:59:43,400 --> 01:59:45,400
I'm saying the genre.

1729
01:59:45,400 --> 01:59:47,400
How dare you disagree?

1730
01:59:47,400 --> 01:59:49,400
Not

1731
01:59:49,400 --> 01:59:51,400
a lot of other tactical games on the list.

1732
01:59:51,400 --> 01:59:53,400
I don't see a lot of those

1733
01:59:53,400 --> 01:59:55,400
other games you were mentioning.

1734
01:59:55,400 --> 01:59:57,400
I definitely agree with Jamie's point,

1735
01:59:57,400 --> 01:59:59,400
that Goful World with a Great Story

1736
01:59:59,400 --> 02:00:01,400
gave it a similar enough

1737
02:00:01,400 --> 02:00:03,400
engine, and it is one of the only

1738
02:00:03,400 --> 02:00:05,400
strategy games to hit as wide adoption

1739
02:00:05,400 --> 02:00:07,400
as it did.

1740
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:09,400
Let's see, some of the other answers from

1741
02:00:09,400 --> 02:00:11,400
Facebook. Daniel S.

1742
02:00:11,400 --> 02:00:13,400
replied and said, yeah, didn't bother with the list.

1743
02:00:13,400 --> 02:00:15,400
They're just bait for more

1744
02:00:15,400 --> 02:00:17,400
page clicks. Check out IGN's

1745
02:00:17,400 --> 02:00:19,400
Top 100 RPGs list.

1746
02:00:19,400 --> 02:00:21,400
They put Persona 4 at number 90.

1747
02:00:21,400 --> 02:00:23,400
I stopped reading lists after that.

1748
02:00:23,400 --> 02:00:25,400
While I don't totally disagree with you,

1749
02:00:25,400 --> 02:00:27,400
one reason I picked this list in particular

1750
02:00:27,400 --> 02:00:29,400
is that it is Time magazine.

1751
02:00:29,400 --> 02:00:31,400
It's not a video game site.

1752
02:00:31,400 --> 02:00:33,400
It's like a news site.

1753
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:35,400
While yes, to some

1754
02:00:35,400 --> 02:00:37,400
extent, it probably still is bait for page clicks.

1755
02:00:37,400 --> 02:00:39,400
Most things on the internet are.

1756
02:00:39,400 --> 02:00:41,400
I kind of felt there was still

1757
02:00:41,400 --> 02:00:43,400
that history behind the publication.

1758
02:00:43,400 --> 02:00:45,400
It would be different if this is something they were

1759
02:00:45,400 --> 02:00:47,400
putting in their magazine, in

1760
02:00:47,400 --> 02:00:49,400
actual print publication, but it's not.

1761
02:00:49,400 --> 02:00:51,400
Has

1762
02:00:51,400 --> 02:00:53,400
Time done an actual video

1763
02:00:53,400 --> 02:00:55,400
game issue?

1764
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:57,400
I don't think, well, in the 80s

1765
02:00:57,400 --> 02:00:59,400
probably. But I don't think we've had

1766
02:00:59,400 --> 02:01:01,400
anything modern coming out of there where they actually

1767
02:01:01,400 --> 02:01:03,400
go into the economics behind it, where they go

1768
02:01:03,400 --> 02:01:05,400
into the social aspects behind it, because that's something

1769
02:01:05,400 --> 02:01:07,400
I would put more along the line of

1770
02:01:07,400 --> 02:01:09,400
Time magazine's caliber.

1771
02:01:09,400 --> 02:01:11,400
That's the type of editorial I'd want to see out of

1772
02:01:11,400 --> 02:01:13,400
Time magazine in relation to video games,

1773
02:01:13,400 --> 02:01:15,400
not a Top 100 list.

1774
02:01:15,400 --> 02:01:17,400
Jonathan L. with a good reply

1775
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:19,400
here on Facebook, well, they're all good, but this one

1776
02:01:19,400 --> 02:01:21,400
particularly caught my attention.

1777
02:01:21,400 --> 02:01:23,400
It seems this is actually a list of

1778
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:25,400
games that were original for their time,

1779
02:01:25,400 --> 02:01:27,400
rather than a list of the all-time best.

1780
02:01:27,400 --> 02:01:29,400
The Super NES library says

1781
02:01:29,400 --> 02:01:31,400
hi. The list also doesn't

1782
02:01:31,400 --> 02:01:33,400
have any treasure games, DS games,

1783
02:01:33,400 --> 02:01:35,400
arcade music games, 3D sports games,

1784
02:01:35,400 --> 02:01:37,400
3D fighting games, MOBAs, or

1785
02:01:37,400 --> 02:01:39,400
any of the Top 40 games on Twitch TV

1786
02:01:39,400 --> 02:01:41,400
right now. Therefore, it is invalid.

1787
02:01:41,400 --> 02:01:43,400
World of Warcraft has to be

1788
02:01:43,400 --> 02:01:45,400
in the Top 40 of Twitch TV, for with

1789
02:01:45,400 --> 02:01:47,400
all the arena matches that go on on there, so I think you

1790
02:01:47,400 --> 02:01:49,400
might have overlooked that one, but I get your point.

1791
02:01:49,400 --> 02:01:51,400
I hadn't even considered it. DDR isn't a game on the list.

1792
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:53,400
No, DDR was not on the list.

1793
02:01:53,400 --> 02:01:55,400
Guitar Hero was.

1794
02:01:55,400 --> 02:01:57,400
I wonder if there's any relationship there.

1795
02:01:57,400 --> 02:01:59,400
Everyone knows that DDR ripped off Guitar Hero.

1796
02:01:59,400 --> 02:02:01,400
Here's the thing.

1797
02:02:01,400 --> 02:02:03,400
In America,

1798
02:02:03,400 --> 02:02:05,400
I know this is hard for the long-time

1799
02:02:05,400 --> 02:02:07,400
fans to hear, so just hold your breath

1800
02:02:07,400 --> 02:02:09,400
for a minute, not too long, don't choke.

1801
02:02:09,400 --> 02:02:11,400
Guitar Hero made a

1802
02:02:11,400 --> 02:02:13,400
bigger impact in the States than DDR did.

1803
02:02:13,400 --> 02:02:15,400
Sorry.

1804
02:02:15,400 --> 02:02:17,400
Truth hurts.

1805
02:02:17,400 --> 02:02:19,400
I mean, I won't deny

1806
02:02:19,400 --> 02:02:21,400
the splash that it made.

1807
02:02:21,400 --> 02:02:23,400
Whether it should have or not is another argument.

1808
02:02:23,400 --> 02:02:25,400
I won't argue that.

1809
02:02:25,400 --> 02:02:27,400
Guitar Hero 1 and 2, I had a

1810
02:02:27,400 --> 02:02:29,400
hell of a lot of fun with.

1811
02:02:29,400 --> 02:02:31,400
It was, you know, being

1812
02:02:31,400 --> 02:02:33,400
the Bimani kid all throughout the

1813
02:02:33,400 --> 02:02:35,400
98 release up until

1814
02:02:35,400 --> 02:02:37,400
when did Guitar Hero come out?

1815
02:02:37,400 --> 02:02:39,400
2007, I believe?

1816
02:02:39,400 --> 02:02:41,400
Compared to

1817
02:02:41,400 --> 02:02:43,400
the only other thing that was available at the time,

1818
02:02:43,400 --> 02:02:45,400
I completely and totally welcomed

1819
02:02:45,400 --> 02:02:47,400
songs that I would actually know from

1820
02:02:47,400 --> 02:02:49,400
my youth, a difference

1821
02:02:49,400 --> 02:02:51,400
in the game, and a very excellent

1822
02:02:51,400 --> 02:02:53,400
presentation. It's just

1823
02:02:53,400 --> 02:02:55,400
Guitar Hero and DDR

1824
02:02:55,400 --> 02:02:57,400
are not, I would not put them

1825
02:02:57,400 --> 02:02:59,400
close enough together, and they both

1826
02:02:59,400 --> 02:03:01,400
made a significant

1827
02:03:01,400 --> 02:03:03,400
splash for each their own

1828
02:03:03,400 --> 02:03:05,400
reasons. DDR was ridiculously

1829
02:03:05,400 --> 02:03:07,400
influential in the arcade, even

1830
02:03:07,400 --> 02:03:09,400
though it can't save them. Not in America, anyways.

1831
02:03:09,400 --> 02:03:11,400
And Guitar Hero for,

1832
02:03:11,400 --> 02:03:13,400
you know, less presentation,

1833
02:03:13,400 --> 02:03:15,400
more performance. I will say, though,

1834
02:03:15,400 --> 02:03:17,400
to give to the other

1835
02:03:17,400 --> 02:03:19,400
side of the coin, though, because I am a long-time

1836
02:03:19,400 --> 02:03:21,400
DDR fan, one thing that should be acknowledged

1837
02:03:21,400 --> 02:03:23,400
about Dance Dance Revolution that the Guitar Hero

1838
02:03:23,400 --> 02:03:25,400
can't lay claim to is that

1839
02:03:25,400 --> 02:03:27,400
none of these video games will you find in a PE

1840
02:03:27,400 --> 02:03:29,400
class, but

1841
02:03:29,400 --> 02:03:31,400
DDR is the only game to have broken that barrier.

1842
02:03:31,400 --> 02:03:33,400
So, you know, again,

1843
02:03:33,400 --> 02:03:35,400
maybe it's in that same category as Minecraft.

1844
02:03:35,400 --> 02:03:37,400
DDR in a PE class is

1845
02:03:37,400 --> 02:03:39,400
kind of a new thing. Give it five or ten

1846
02:03:39,400 --> 02:03:41,400
years, and maybe we will have

1847
02:03:41,400 --> 02:03:43,400
accepted it a little more as a culture.

1848
02:03:43,400 --> 02:03:45,400
Maybe Minecraft will soon become

1849
02:03:45,400 --> 02:03:47,400
sculpting class lessons. Who knows?

1850
02:03:47,400 --> 02:03:49,400
Alright, let me read, like, one more of these,

1851
02:03:49,400 --> 02:03:51,400
and I'm so sorry I didn't get to everybody, but

1852
02:03:51,400 --> 02:03:53,400
I want to read this one from Degenerate Johnny.

1853
02:03:53,400 --> 02:03:55,400
It appears to me that most of the

1854
02:03:55,400 --> 02:03:57,400
mainstream media focuses on commercial successes

1855
02:03:57,400 --> 02:03:59,400
or games with a cult following.

1856
02:03:59,400 --> 02:04:01,400
Since this is a top 100 list, it doesn't surprise

1857
02:04:01,400 --> 02:04:03,400
me that Time did the same thing in this scenario.

1858
02:04:03,400 --> 02:04:05,400
The purpose of this list was not

1859
02:04:05,400 --> 02:04:07,400
to inform us gamers, because this is

1860
02:04:07,400 --> 02:04:09,400
something that we can expect from a generalized top

1861
02:04:09,400 --> 02:04:11,400
100 list. This list was to inform

1862
02:04:11,400 --> 02:04:13,400
the magazine's target market,

1863
02:04:13,400 --> 02:04:15,400
which is clearly not us gamers.

1864
02:04:15,400 --> 02:04:17,400
Movie buffs

1865
02:04:17,400 --> 02:04:19,400
don't care about top 100 movie lists for

1866
02:04:19,400 --> 02:04:21,400
magazines such as Time and People. Why should

1867
02:04:21,400 --> 02:04:23,400
we? Playboy features games in

1868
02:04:23,400 --> 02:04:25,400
almost every issue. Should we care about

1869
02:04:25,400 --> 02:04:27,400
this? Only if there's a centerfold of

1870
02:04:27,400 --> 02:04:29,400
our favorite video game female characters,

1871
02:04:29,400 --> 02:04:31,400
or male if you read Playgirl.

1872
02:04:31,400 --> 02:04:33,400
Jamie, quit drooling over the centerfold of

1873
02:04:33,400 --> 02:04:35,400
Garrus. Really?

1874
02:04:35,400 --> 02:04:37,400
Gaming in every issue of Playboy?

1875
02:04:37,400 --> 02:04:39,400
Honestly? I'm pretty sure they do.

1876
02:04:39,400 --> 02:04:41,400
It is a magazine for men. Sure.

1877
02:04:41,400 --> 02:04:43,400
Wow.

1878
02:04:43,400 --> 02:04:45,400
That's just funny to think about. There's not enough

1879
02:04:45,400 --> 02:04:47,400
Turian in my life.

1880
02:04:47,400 --> 02:04:49,400
Okay, before the weird

1881
02:04:49,400 --> 02:04:51,400
turn that comment took in the second half,

1882
02:04:51,400 --> 02:04:53,400
I'm so with you on the first

1883
02:04:53,400 --> 02:04:55,400
half, is that, you know,

1884
02:04:55,400 --> 02:04:57,400
the mainstream media

1885
02:04:57,400 --> 02:04:59,400
focuses on commercial successes or games

1886
02:04:59,400 --> 02:05:01,400
with a cult following. That is where this list really

1887
02:05:01,400 --> 02:05:03,400
came from. Of course. For the record,

1888
02:05:03,400 --> 02:05:05,400
I have to say one thing real quick.

1889
02:05:05,400 --> 02:05:07,400
Do you know what Cleverbot is?

1890
02:05:07,400 --> 02:05:09,400
Uh, is that an AOL bot?

1891
02:05:09,400 --> 02:05:11,400
Kinda. It's actually a website you type stuff in and it

1892
02:05:11,400 --> 02:05:13,400
replies to you. Um, I typed in Turians

1893
02:05:13,400 --> 02:05:15,400
and it replied, I am the very model of a scientist

1894
02:05:15,400 --> 02:05:17,400
Larian.

1895
02:05:17,400 --> 02:05:19,400
Just saying. Cause some nerd

1896
02:05:19,400 --> 02:05:21,400
works at that website. You know it.

1897
02:05:21,400 --> 02:05:23,400
Oh, there's Portal ones on here too. Alright, thank you to

1898
02:05:23,400 --> 02:05:25,400
everybody on both Facebook and Google+. I'm

1899
02:05:25,400 --> 02:05:27,400
sorry if I didn't read your answer, but we are

1900
02:05:27,400 --> 02:05:29,400
running a little long tonight. I encourage you to visit

1901
02:05:29,400 --> 02:05:31,400
both of our communities on Google+.

1902
02:05:31,400 --> 02:05:33,400
Search for Orange Lounge Radio or

1903
02:05:33,400 --> 02:05:35,400
Facebook. Go to Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

1904
02:05:35,400 --> 02:05:37,400
I encourage you to go and read

1905
02:05:37,400 --> 02:05:39,400
all of the responses and click like

1906
02:05:39,400 --> 02:05:41,400
or plus one. Or if you're on the

1907
02:05:41,400 --> 02:05:43,400
Wii U, you can click YEAH!

1908
02:05:43,400 --> 02:05:45,400
YEAH! YEAH!

1909
02:05:45,400 --> 02:05:47,400
Cause that's the new, cause obviously

1910
02:05:47,400 --> 02:05:49,400
like and plus one are trademark terms. So there's

1911
02:05:49,400 --> 02:05:51,400
it was either YEAH or YEAH.

1912
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:53,400
It's one of the two. Y-E-A-H.

1913
02:05:53,400 --> 02:05:55,400
Why do they have like plus coins or something?

1914
02:05:55,400 --> 02:05:57,400
That actually would have been a good idea.

1915
02:05:57,400 --> 02:05:59,400
Or one up. Cause Nintendo

1916
02:05:59,400 --> 02:06:01,400
just thought of it yesterday.

1917
02:06:01,400 --> 02:06:03,400
No, no, today.

1918
02:06:03,400 --> 02:06:05,400
Actually a one up is really fucking cute.

1919
02:06:05,400 --> 02:06:07,400
Yeah it is.

1920
02:06:07,400 --> 02:06:09,400
Loki, I think you should go work for Nintendo.

1921
02:06:09,400 --> 02:06:11,400
Oh because I know what the internet is.

1922
02:06:11,400 --> 02:06:13,400
Instead of like, what did you just

1923
02:06:13,400 --> 02:06:15,400
introduce? What did you speak of?

1924
02:06:15,400 --> 02:06:17,400
Be surprised. Why not?

1925
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:19,400
Alright. We have to make

1926
02:06:19,400 --> 02:06:21,400
we have to make screen name.

1927
02:06:21,400 --> 02:06:23,400
We'll attach it to the

1928
02:06:23,400 --> 02:06:25,400
console and what if their console breaks?

1929
02:06:25,400 --> 02:06:27,400
Our consoles never break you!

1930
02:06:27,400 --> 02:06:29,400
Death to you! I don't know.

1931
02:06:29,400 --> 02:06:31,400
Alright, Loki.

1932
02:06:31,400 --> 02:06:33,400
How about some real news?

1933
02:06:33,400 --> 02:06:35,400
Some real news. Okay.

1934
02:06:35,400 --> 02:06:37,400
Let's talk about Black Ops 2.

1935
02:06:37,400 --> 02:06:39,400
Black Ops 2, big surprise.

1936
02:06:39,400 --> 02:06:41,400
Biggest title of the year.

1937
02:06:41,400 --> 02:06:43,400
It has broken all sorts of records.

1938
02:06:43,400 --> 02:06:45,400
You know, Modern Warfare 3 of course

1939
02:06:45,400 --> 02:06:47,400
sold 6.5 million copies in the

1940
02:06:47,400 --> 02:06:49,400
US and UK.

1941
02:06:49,400 --> 02:06:51,400
And you know, the previous record

1942
02:06:51,400 --> 02:06:53,400
was 400 million dollars

1943
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:55,400
in the first day.

1944
02:06:55,400 --> 02:06:57,400
Black Ops 2 beat that

1945
02:06:57,400 --> 02:06:59,400
with 500 million

1946
02:06:59,400 --> 02:07:01,400
dollars in the first day.

1947
02:07:01,400 --> 02:07:03,400
So that's a lot of game.

1948
02:07:03,400 --> 02:07:05,400
And the

1949
02:07:05,400 --> 02:07:07,400
biggest entertainment launch in

1950
02:07:07,400 --> 02:07:09,400
history.

1951
02:07:09,400 --> 02:07:11,400
So, hooray.

1952
02:07:11,400 --> 02:07:13,400
And I'm sure next year you'll

1953
02:07:13,400 --> 02:07:15,400
maybe beat your record again.

1954
02:07:15,400 --> 02:07:17,400
Modern Warfare 4 will break it.

1955
02:07:17,400 --> 02:07:19,400
Black Ops 3 will break it.

1956
02:07:19,400 --> 02:07:21,400
Well, if there's new consoles

1957
02:07:21,400 --> 02:07:23,400
next year though, that could throw an interesting monkey

1958
02:07:23,400 --> 02:07:25,400
wrench in the situation. Nah, because they'll make it for the other

1959
02:07:25,400 --> 02:07:27,400
consoles as well. That's true. There'll be

1960
02:07:27,400 --> 02:07:29,400
that little while where they're making it for

1961
02:07:29,400 --> 02:07:31,400
everything. Because there's the Wii U version.

1962
02:07:31,400 --> 02:07:33,400
Are they still making PlayStation

1963
02:07:33,400 --> 02:07:35,400
2 versions? Nope.

1964
02:07:35,400 --> 02:07:37,400
That stopped with World

1965
02:07:37,400 --> 02:07:39,400
of War. Not as of

1966
02:07:39,400 --> 02:07:41,400
the big titles, but I was actually glancing

1967
02:07:41,400 --> 02:07:43,400
over and you guys were doing release dates and I do still see

1968
02:07:43,400 --> 02:07:45,400
some new title PlayStation 2 versions.

1969
02:07:45,400 --> 02:07:47,400
Pro Evo.

1970
02:07:47,400 --> 02:07:49,400
Pro Evo, just like the Wii version.

1971
02:07:49,400 --> 02:07:51,400
FIFA was just like the

1972
02:07:51,400 --> 02:07:53,400
same thing. Those are just rehashed versions

1973
02:07:53,400 --> 02:07:55,400
They're there, just saying.

1974
02:07:55,400 --> 02:07:57,400
New PlayStation 2 titles are crazy to me.

1975
02:07:57,400 --> 02:07:59,400
To be fair though, didn't we discuss on a prior show

1976
02:07:59,400 --> 02:08:01,400
that really the only PlayStation 2 game

1977
02:08:01,400 --> 02:08:03,400
that's left to come out is the Final Fantasy 11

1978
02:08:03,400 --> 02:08:05,400
expansion? I want to say that came up in a prior show.

1979
02:08:05,400 --> 02:08:07,400
That like, here's what you have to look forward

1980
02:08:07,400 --> 02:08:09,400
to in 2013.

1981
02:08:09,400 --> 02:08:11,400
One PlayStation 2 game.

1982
02:08:11,400 --> 02:08:13,400
11 expansion? Mhm.

1983
02:08:13,400 --> 02:08:15,400
Oh, duh. Nevermind.

1984
02:08:15,400 --> 02:08:17,400
Alright.

1985
02:08:17,400 --> 02:08:19,400
So yeah, lots of money.

1986
02:08:19,400 --> 02:08:21,400
Alright, moving on to

1987
02:08:21,400 --> 02:08:23,400
LEGO Lord of the Rings.

1988
02:08:23,400 --> 02:08:25,400
I know some of y'all are excited about The Hobbit.

1989
02:08:25,400 --> 02:08:27,400
And so of course, up comes

1990
02:08:27,400 --> 02:08:29,400
all the new tie-in games with this.

1991
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:31,400
So there's LEGO Lord of the Rings, which I guess

1992
02:08:31,400 --> 02:08:33,400
granted, LEGO is kind of its own little

1993
02:08:33,400 --> 02:08:35,400
monster gaming series, but regardless.

1994
02:08:35,400 --> 02:08:37,400
The Xbox

1995
02:08:37,400 --> 02:08:39,400
360 version of this came out

1996
02:08:39,400 --> 02:08:41,400
just this past week, but here's

1997
02:08:41,400 --> 02:08:43,400
something crazy.

1998
02:08:43,400 --> 02:08:45,400
I guess some demo discs

1999
02:08:45,400 --> 02:08:47,400
as opposed to retail game discs

2000
02:08:47,400 --> 02:08:49,400
got shipped out to retailers.

2001
02:08:49,400 --> 02:08:51,400
Not quite.

2002
02:08:51,400 --> 02:08:53,400
Oh, really?

2003
02:08:53,400 --> 02:08:55,400
The retail discs actually got shipped

2004
02:08:55,400 --> 02:08:57,400
out, but they were labeled as demo discs.

2005
02:08:57,400 --> 02:08:59,400
So they weren't

2006
02:08:59,400 --> 02:09:01,400
actually demo discs, it's just

2007
02:09:01,400 --> 02:09:03,400
a demo copy on it. But what

2008
02:09:03,400 --> 02:09:05,400
a collector's item that is, because

2009
02:09:05,400 --> 02:09:07,400
these stories are saying, quick, you better take them back

2010
02:09:07,400 --> 02:09:09,400
and get them exchanged. Hell no, you

2011
02:09:09,400 --> 02:09:11,400
shouldn't hang onto that thing. That's gonna

2012
02:09:11,400 --> 02:09:13,400
be money to some

2013
02:09:13,400 --> 02:09:15,400
collector. It's only a small

2014
02:09:15,400 --> 02:09:17,400
it's not all of them, like in fact,

2015
02:09:17,400 --> 02:09:19,400
all the ones we got shipped were not like that.

2016
02:09:19,400 --> 02:09:21,400
Microsoft to Walmart, Target,

2017
02:09:21,400 --> 02:09:23,400
and Toys R Us is the places

2018
02:09:23,400 --> 02:09:25,400
you're gonna find this, so not

2019
02:09:25,400 --> 02:09:27,400
on pod distribution. Sorry, Loki.

2020
02:09:27,400 --> 02:09:29,400
Nah, sorry, I got my little big

2021
02:09:29,400 --> 02:09:31,400
planet.

2022
02:09:31,400 --> 02:09:33,400
So, yeah, very, very

2023
02:09:33,400 --> 02:09:35,400
interesting. So they are doing an official

2024
02:09:35,400 --> 02:09:37,400
recall. You can contact WB

2025
02:09:37,400 --> 02:09:39,400
Games either by email or by

2026
02:09:39,400 --> 02:09:41,400
phone, but at the same time,

2027
02:09:41,400 --> 02:09:43,400
if the disc really is

2028
02:09:43,400 --> 02:09:45,400
the game, then hooray, you have the game.

2029
02:09:45,400 --> 02:09:47,400
I say enjoy it

2030
02:09:47,400 --> 02:09:49,400
and then keep that thing in good condition

2031
02:09:49,400 --> 02:09:51,400
because a collector may want that someday.

2032
02:09:51,400 --> 02:09:53,400
Maybe. I don't know.

2033
02:09:53,400 --> 02:09:55,400
I mean, it might be stretching it a bit. It's no

2034
02:09:55,400 --> 02:09:57,400
what's that frickin'

2035
02:09:57,400 --> 02:09:59,400
NES game?

2036
02:09:59,400 --> 02:10:01,400
Stadium Events?

2037
02:10:01,400 --> 02:10:03,400
What's that game that was for the NES

2038
02:10:03,400 --> 02:10:05,400
power pad? It was World Class Track Meet before

2039
02:10:05,400 --> 02:10:07,400
World Class Track Meet.

2040
02:10:07,400 --> 02:10:09,400
I think it was Stadium Events. That thing goes for

2041
02:10:09,400 --> 02:10:11,400
like, buku bucks now.

2042
02:10:11,400 --> 02:10:13,400
Or the

2043
02:10:13,400 --> 02:10:15,400
competition cartridges from like

2044
02:10:15,400 --> 02:10:17,400
Nintendo World Championships.

2045
02:10:17,400 --> 02:10:19,400
Oh, I thought you were gonna say like the Blockbuster

2046
02:10:19,400 --> 02:10:21,400
Championship thing. Those too. All those cartridges

2047
02:10:21,400 --> 02:10:23,400
go for buku bucks too, so

2048
02:10:23,400 --> 02:10:25,400
misprints and shit.

2049
02:10:25,400 --> 02:10:27,400
Dark Soccer, you collect old stuff. I have a

2050
02:10:27,400 --> 02:10:29,400
Monopoly.

2051
02:10:29,400 --> 02:10:31,400
Oh. That's right, a

2052
02:10:31,400 --> 02:10:33,400
Monopoly. And that was on

2053
02:10:33,400 --> 02:10:35,400
Genesis? No, Master System.

2054
02:10:35,400 --> 02:10:37,400
I have two of them.

2055
02:10:37,400 --> 02:10:39,400
And I have an actual monopoly.

2056
02:10:39,400 --> 02:10:41,400
Alright.

2057
02:10:41,400 --> 02:10:43,400
Let's move on with some more

2058
02:10:43,400 --> 02:10:45,400
no, not more news.

2059
02:10:45,400 --> 02:10:47,400
Yes.

2060
02:10:47,400 --> 02:10:49,400
More news. I'm kidding.

2061
02:10:49,400 --> 02:10:51,400
I'm not with it tonight. Dark Soccer.

2062
02:10:51,400 --> 02:10:53,400
Well, in other news.

2063
02:10:53,400 --> 02:10:55,400
And I'm gonna

2064
02:10:55,400 --> 02:10:57,400
mispronounce the name of this game because I'm not sure

2065
02:10:57,400 --> 02:10:59,400
exactly how it's said. Is it Arm A?

2066
02:10:59,400 --> 02:11:01,400
Arm A3? Arma.

2067
02:11:01,400 --> 02:11:03,400
Arma? Arma 3? Okay. Because it's not a game I'm

2068
02:11:03,400 --> 02:11:05,400
super interested in, but I'm pretty pissed off

2069
02:11:05,400 --> 02:11:07,400
about the situation.

2070
02:11:07,400 --> 02:11:09,400
The developers, Ivan, I guess it's

2071
02:11:09,400 --> 02:11:11,400
Buchta and Martin Pezlar

2072
02:11:11,400 --> 02:11:13,400
are, actually

2073
02:11:13,400 --> 02:11:15,400
have been held in jail for

2074
02:11:15,400 --> 02:11:17,400
70 days in Greece.

2075
02:11:17,400 --> 02:11:19,400
Because they have been

2076
02:11:19,400 --> 02:11:21,400
charged with espionage.

2077
02:11:21,400 --> 02:11:23,400
They've actually now been refused bail

2078
02:11:23,400 --> 02:11:25,400
and have to be tried in front of a

2079
02:11:25,400 --> 02:11:27,400
Greek court. And this is

2080
02:11:27,400 --> 02:11:29,400
coming from the Czech

2081
02:11:29,400 --> 02:11:31,400
news site Roslas.

2082
02:11:31,400 --> 02:11:33,400
Excuse me.

2083
02:11:33,400 --> 02:11:35,400
They've been made to wake weeks

2084
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:37,400
longer because of a

2085
02:11:37,400 --> 02:11:39,400
strike in the Greek legal system.

2086
02:11:39,400 --> 02:11:41,400
They've been accused of spying on

2087
02:11:41,400 --> 02:11:43,400
Greek military installations and face up to

2088
02:11:43,400 --> 02:11:45,400
20 years in jail.

2089
02:11:45,400 --> 02:11:47,400
The shooter itself was based on the island where

2090
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:49,400
they were arrested. And they

2091
02:11:49,400 --> 02:11:51,400
said that they were just there on holiday.

2092
02:11:51,400 --> 02:11:53,400
So, um,

2093
02:11:53,400 --> 02:11:55,400
they're, and this is just a quote

2094
02:11:55,400 --> 02:11:57,400
from, um, Ivan's father.

2095
02:11:57,400 --> 02:11:59,400
They're in a cell with over 25 people.

2096
02:11:59,400 --> 02:12:01,400
They sleep on the ground. They have food twice

2097
02:12:01,400 --> 02:12:03,400
a day. Um, they no longer

2098
02:12:03,400 --> 02:12:05,400
tell us on the phone that it's alright that

2099
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:07,400
they're handling it. After the

2100
02:12:07,400 --> 02:12:09,400
court's decision, we only hear

2101
02:12:09,400 --> 02:12:11,400
from them something no parent ever wants to hear.

2102
02:12:11,400 --> 02:12:13,400
Mom, Dad, please save us.

2103
02:12:13,400 --> 02:12:15,400
So, um, the

2104
02:12:15,400 --> 02:12:17,400
people have been, um,

2105
02:12:17,400 --> 02:12:19,400
writing to the Czech president

2106
02:12:19,400 --> 02:12:21,400
and prime minister saying that the foreign ministry

2107
02:12:21,400 --> 02:12:23,400
hasn't been doing enough. And the

2108
02:12:23,400 --> 02:12:25,400
foreign ministry spokesperson says that they're

2109
02:12:25,400 --> 02:12:27,400
trying to work it from all angles and trying to help

2110
02:12:27,400 --> 02:12:29,400
them out. So,

2111
02:12:29,400 --> 02:12:31,400
yeah.

2112
02:12:31,400 --> 02:12:33,400
Yeah.

2113
02:12:33,400 --> 02:12:35,400
Yeah, it's an ongoing

2114
02:12:35,400 --> 02:12:37,400
saga. We heard about that before.

2115
02:12:37,400 --> 02:12:39,400
And, um, they may be in there a little while,

2116
02:12:39,400 --> 02:12:41,400
huh? Well, let's hope not.

2117
02:12:41,400 --> 02:12:43,400
Alright, uh, let's move on.

2118
02:12:43,400 --> 02:12:45,400
We're almost to the mailbag. The FUs of the Week.

2119
02:12:45,400 --> 02:12:47,400
And soon, Skype line at 1877

2120
02:12:47,400 --> 02:12:49,400
Game OLR or Orange

2121
02:12:49,400 --> 02:12:51,400
L'Anterio on Skype. But first, Loki.

2122
02:12:51,400 --> 02:12:53,400
And this is kind of unfortunate on the whole

2123
02:12:53,400 --> 02:12:55,400
mobile front. And actually, I think it's on

2124
02:12:55,400 --> 02:12:57,400
PC as well, if I remember correctly. Um,

2125
02:12:57,400 --> 02:12:59,400
but Open Faint, the kind of

2126
02:12:59,400 --> 02:13:01,400
alternative to using

2127
02:13:01,400 --> 02:13:03,400
Gamer Room, at least on the iOS platform, and

2128
02:13:03,400 --> 02:13:05,400
well, it was one of

2129
02:13:05,400 --> 02:13:07,400
the only kind of multi-platform

2130
02:13:07,400 --> 02:13:09,400
kind of, uh,

2131
02:13:09,400 --> 02:13:11,400
hubs for

2132
02:13:11,400 --> 02:13:13,400
even the Android marketplace. Well,

2133
02:13:13,400 --> 02:13:15,400
you may remember GREE

2134
02:13:15,400 --> 02:13:17,400
purchased Open Faint,

2135
02:13:17,400 --> 02:13:19,400
its parent company, back in April

2136
02:13:19,400 --> 02:13:21,400
2011. Well, now,

2137
02:13:21,400 --> 02:13:23,400
Open Faint is gonna be

2138
02:13:23,400 --> 02:13:25,400
shut down. And they're

2139
02:13:25,400 --> 02:13:27,400
shutting down the service starting, um,

2140
02:13:27,400 --> 02:13:29,400
well, actually effective December 14th.

2141
02:13:29,400 --> 02:13:31,400
And in its place is gonna be GREE's

2142
02:13:31,400 --> 02:13:33,400
platform that they have, which I've

2143
02:13:33,400 --> 02:13:35,400
not experienced yet.

2144
02:13:35,400 --> 02:13:37,400
You know what's funny is, uh,

2145
02:13:37,400 --> 02:13:39,400
this is what I was teasing about before the break.

2146
02:13:39,400 --> 02:13:41,400
Um, one of our listeners, Peter Uno, he always

2147
02:13:41,400 --> 02:13:43,400
does these little live blogs as he's listening to the show.

2148
02:13:43,400 --> 02:13:45,400
And he was listening to the podcast today.

2149
02:13:45,400 --> 02:13:47,400
And he said about the show,

2150
02:13:47,400 --> 02:13:49,400
haha, you just mentioned

2151
02:13:49,400 --> 02:13:51,400
Open Faint not going out of business.

2152
02:13:51,400 --> 02:13:53,400
Because we were having that conversation last week about, like,

2153
02:13:53,400 --> 02:13:55,400
things coexisting. And one of us brought up,

2154
02:13:55,400 --> 02:13:57,400
I think it was me, brought up the whole, well, you have

2155
02:13:57,400 --> 02:13:59,400
Game Center, but it didn't put Open Faint out of

2156
02:13:59,400 --> 02:14:01,400
business. Oops. Well, it didn't.

2157
02:14:01,400 --> 02:14:03,400
It's just, it's, you know,

2158
02:14:03,400 --> 02:14:05,400
becoming something else. Yeah, it is

2159
02:14:05,400 --> 02:14:07,400
still a little bit funny.

2160
02:14:07,400 --> 02:14:09,400
And, of course, Peter Uno brings it up because

2161
02:14:09,400 --> 02:14:11,400
GREE is a Japanese company.

2162
02:14:11,400 --> 02:14:13,400
And very prominent for those titles over there.

2163
02:14:13,400 --> 02:14:15,400
Ah. And, you know, it didn't really

2164
02:14:15,400 --> 02:14:17,400
make the regional cross. I remember,

2165
02:14:17,400 --> 02:14:19,400
uh,

2166
02:14:19,400 --> 02:14:21,400
early days of the, of these

2167
02:14:21,400 --> 02:14:23,400
networks really coming out, Aurora Faint

2168
02:14:23,400 --> 02:14:25,400
turned into Open Faint. And it was

2169
02:14:25,400 --> 02:14:27,400
just a runaway hit. And I... Wasn't Aurora

2170
02:14:27,400 --> 02:14:29,400
Faint the game? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2171
02:14:29,400 --> 02:14:31,400
Aurora Faint had

2172
02:14:31,400 --> 02:14:33,400
its little social hub network

2173
02:14:33,400 --> 02:14:35,400
within game. And whenever

2174
02:14:35,400 --> 02:14:37,400
they started... That was a huge game in the

2175
02:14:37,400 --> 02:14:39,400
early days of iOS. And whenever they opened

2176
02:14:39,400 --> 02:14:41,400
their network, their platform to other

2177
02:14:41,400 --> 02:14:43,400
people is how it became Open Faint

2178
02:14:43,400 --> 02:14:45,400
that others could use. I mean,

2179
02:14:45,400 --> 02:14:47,400
Open Faint in America, Open Faint

2180
02:14:47,400 --> 02:14:49,400
beat out N.G. Mokos++,

2181
02:14:49,400 --> 02:14:51,400
who I think was also bought by

2182
02:14:51,400 --> 02:14:53,400
GREE, um,

2183
02:14:53,400 --> 02:14:55,400
uh, that beat out Plus Plus. It

2184
02:14:55,400 --> 02:14:57,400
beat out Crystal or...

2185
02:14:57,400 --> 02:14:59,400
Crystal's still lagging.

2186
02:14:59,400 --> 02:15:01,400
I don't see it very often. But Open Faint

2187
02:15:01,400 --> 02:15:03,400
I see everywhere. And now,

2188
02:15:03,400 --> 02:15:05,400
for it to go away and

2189
02:15:05,400 --> 02:15:07,400
to cease functioning this

2190
02:15:07,400 --> 02:15:09,400
soon is kinda crazy

2191
02:15:09,400 --> 02:15:11,400
in my mind.

2192
02:15:11,400 --> 02:15:13,400
Alright. Well, let's move on

2193
02:15:13,400 --> 02:15:15,400
to a story about another lawsuit in the gaming

2194
02:15:15,400 --> 02:15:17,400
world. Jamie, I'm really interested on your take

2195
02:15:17,400 --> 02:15:19,400
on this as a designer. This is really

2196
02:15:19,400 --> 02:15:21,400
interesting and kinda somebody who has

2197
02:15:21,400 --> 02:15:23,400
to be aware of, like, copyright

2198
02:15:23,400 --> 02:15:25,400
work when it comes to design.

2199
02:15:25,400 --> 02:15:27,400
This has to do with tattoos.

2200
02:15:27,400 --> 02:15:29,400
So a tattoo artist has sued

2201
02:15:29,400 --> 02:15:31,400
THQ. And if there's one company

2202
02:15:31,400 --> 02:15:33,400
that can't afford a lawsuit right now, it's THQ.

2203
02:15:33,400 --> 02:15:35,400
But a tattoo artist sued

2204
02:15:35,400 --> 02:15:37,400
THQ over some

2205
02:15:37,400 --> 02:15:39,400
tattoo art that is seen in

2206
02:15:39,400 --> 02:15:41,400
UFC Undisputed 2010

2207
02:15:41,400 --> 02:15:43,400
and UFC Undisputed 3.

2208
02:15:43,400 --> 02:15:45,400
The tattoo artist is named Chris

2209
02:15:45,400 --> 02:15:47,400
Escobedo

2210
02:15:47,400 --> 02:15:49,400
and he filed a lawsuit against THQ

2211
02:15:49,400 --> 02:15:51,400
because of a tattoo

2212
02:15:51,400 --> 02:15:53,400
that he has copyrighted

2213
02:15:53,400 --> 02:15:55,400
that is on MMA fighter Carlos

2214
02:15:55,400 --> 02:15:57,400
Condit in these UFC

2215
02:15:57,400 --> 02:15:59,400
games. Now, his argument

2216
02:15:59,400 --> 02:16:01,400
says that even though his

2217
02:16:01,400 --> 02:16:03,400
tattoo is on

2218
02:16:03,400 --> 02:16:05,400
this public figure, the

2219
02:16:05,400 --> 02:16:07,400
tattoo's design still belongs to

2220
02:16:07,400 --> 02:16:09,400
him. He created it originally.

2221
02:16:09,400 --> 02:16:11,400
He never signed the rights to the

2222
02:16:11,400 --> 02:16:13,400
design-awaited Condit. So by

2223
02:16:13,400 --> 02:16:15,400
digitally recreating the design,

2224
02:16:15,400 --> 02:16:17,400
which, you know, THQ did,

2225
02:16:17,400 --> 02:16:19,400
THQ is said to

2226
02:16:19,400 --> 02:16:21,400
have, in this lawsuit, violated

2227
02:16:21,400 --> 02:16:23,400
Escobedo's copyright

2228
02:16:23,400 --> 02:16:25,400
on the work.

2229
02:16:25,400 --> 02:16:27,400
The lawsuit goes on to say that THQ using

2230
02:16:27,400 --> 02:16:29,400
Condit's likeness on the website

2231
02:16:29,400 --> 02:16:31,400
violates Escobedo's copyright

2232
02:16:31,400 --> 02:16:33,400
as well. The lawsuit wants

2233
02:16:33,400 --> 02:16:35,400
actual damages caused by THQ's

2234
02:16:35,400 --> 02:16:37,400
use of the artwork, as well

2235
02:16:37,400 --> 02:16:39,400
as an order directing THQ

2236
02:16:39,400 --> 02:16:41,400
to account to Mr.

2237
02:16:41,400 --> 02:16:43,400
Escobedo

2238
02:16:43,400 --> 02:16:45,400
for all gains, profits, and advantages

2239
02:16:45,400 --> 02:16:47,400
derived by them by their

2240
02:16:47,400 --> 02:16:49,400
wrongful conduct and to

2241
02:16:49,400 --> 02:16:51,400
disgorge all profits obtained by their

2242
02:16:51,400 --> 02:16:53,400
wrongful conduct.

2243
02:16:53,400 --> 02:16:55,400
He's got a legal point,

2244
02:16:55,400 --> 02:16:57,400
but, honestly, this is

2245
02:16:57,400 --> 02:16:59,400
just being selfish and greedy.

2246
02:16:59,400 --> 02:17:01,400
I mean, maybe he's got bills that need to be paid.

2247
02:17:01,400 --> 02:17:03,400
I don't know.

2248
02:17:03,400 --> 02:17:05,400
But, I mean, if I did

2249
02:17:05,400 --> 02:17:07,400
a design, you know,

2250
02:17:07,400 --> 02:17:09,400
that's... Now, if it's something

2251
02:17:09,400 --> 02:17:11,400
that

2252
02:17:11,400 --> 02:17:13,400
wasn't being worn on a human

2253
02:17:13,400 --> 02:17:15,400
body, like, if it was, like, say,

2254
02:17:15,400 --> 02:17:17,400
a banner, or something, or

2255
02:17:17,400 --> 02:17:19,400
some, like, actual artwork

2256
02:17:19,400 --> 02:17:21,400
that I put up, you know, as

2257
02:17:21,400 --> 02:17:23,400
something on display, and they

2258
02:17:23,400 --> 02:17:25,400
used that, like, as a logo, or

2259
02:17:25,400 --> 02:17:27,400
something you

2260
02:17:27,400 --> 02:17:29,400
specifically, with the intention

2261
02:17:29,400 --> 02:17:31,400
of making money off of it,

2262
02:17:31,400 --> 02:17:33,400
instead of actually recreating

2263
02:17:33,400 --> 02:17:35,400
a personal likeness,

2264
02:17:35,400 --> 02:17:37,400
then, yeah, I would, I would kinda go after

2265
02:17:37,400 --> 02:17:39,400
that. I would say, you know, you're using something

2266
02:17:39,400 --> 02:17:41,400
that I did, and making money,

2267
02:17:41,400 --> 02:17:43,400
using it for the express purpose of making money.

2268
02:17:43,400 --> 02:17:45,400
All they did was recreate

2269
02:17:45,400 --> 02:17:47,400
a likeness, and the guy licensed

2270
02:17:47,400 --> 02:17:49,400
his likeness, which includes

2271
02:17:49,400 --> 02:17:51,400
everything attached to his likeness.

2272
02:17:51,400 --> 02:17:53,400
Do you think maybe the tattoo artist

2273
02:17:53,400 --> 02:17:55,400
should be going after this

2274
02:17:55,400 --> 02:17:57,400
fighter? Because the fighter should've known

2275
02:17:57,400 --> 02:17:59,400
about this before he licensed it. Well, on

2276
02:17:59,400 --> 02:18:01,400
top of that, when you do a tattoo for

2277
02:18:01,400 --> 02:18:03,400
somebody, as far as I

2278
02:18:03,400 --> 02:18:05,400
understand, unless you

2279
02:18:05,400 --> 02:18:07,400
have filed a legit copyright

2280
02:18:07,400 --> 02:18:09,400
on this item, first

2281
02:18:09,400 --> 02:18:11,400
of all, the, um,

2282
02:18:11,400 --> 02:18:13,400
the fighter should've been up

2283
02:18:13,400 --> 02:18:15,400
front and said something if there was an

2284
02:18:15,400 --> 02:18:17,400
actual, uh,

2285
02:18:17,400 --> 02:18:19,400
copyright filed.

2286
02:18:19,400 --> 02:18:21,400
If there's not a copyright filed

2287
02:18:21,400 --> 02:18:23,400
on it, this guy has no ground to stand on.

2288
02:18:23,400 --> 02:18:25,400
You know,

2289
02:18:25,400 --> 02:18:27,400
in fact, I think it's any,

2290
02:18:27,400 --> 02:18:29,400
um, unless this guy, it's this guy's

2291
02:18:29,400 --> 02:18:31,400
private business, I think that any

2292
02:18:31,400 --> 02:18:33,400
tattoo artist, unless they're, like,

2293
02:18:33,400 --> 02:18:35,400
an independent contractor,

2294
02:18:35,400 --> 02:18:37,400
listens over their work to the studio they do

2295
02:18:37,400 --> 02:18:39,400
the work for. Uh, Loki, I want to get to your thoughts,

2296
02:18:39,400 --> 02:18:41,400
too, as well as Jason, if he has any, but, um,

2297
02:18:41,400 --> 02:18:43,400
going to the chat room, because this is the exact same

2298
02:18:43,400 --> 02:18:45,400
thing I thought of. DukeNukem at

2299
02:18:45,400 --> 02:18:47,400
live.vognetwork.com says, didn't the

2300
02:18:47,400 --> 02:18:49,400
same kind of thing happen with the Tyson tattoo

2301
02:18:49,400 --> 02:18:51,400
in the Hangover Part 2? I believe

2302
02:18:51,400 --> 02:18:53,400
it did. That's the exact same thing I thought of, is that

2303
02:18:53,400 --> 02:18:55,400
they had to go, like, digitally re-

2304
02:18:55,400 --> 02:18:57,400
re-do that guy. Uh, Loki,

2305
02:18:57,400 --> 02:18:59,400
your thought. Well, I was just gonna say, I don't think it's anything

2306
02:18:59,400 --> 02:19:01,400
that, I, can you even

2307
02:19:01,400 --> 02:19:03,400
do that? I mean, because if you think about it,

2308
02:19:03,400 --> 02:19:05,400
you, you have this copyright thing,

2309
02:19:05,400 --> 02:19:07,400
so he can't make any, you know, public

2310
02:19:07,400 --> 02:19:09,400
appearances anywhere, because if he's captured on

2311
02:19:09,400 --> 02:19:11,400
camera, oh, it's a, it's a copyright

2312
02:19:11,400 --> 02:19:13,400
violation. That seems a little stupid,

2313
02:19:13,400 --> 02:19:15,400
like, if you, if you're putting it on somebody.

2314
02:19:15,400 --> 02:19:17,400
Now, if it was something blatant, like, he

2315
02:19:17,400 --> 02:19:19,400
had him tattoo Nintendo's logo on

2316
02:19:19,400 --> 02:19:21,400
his face or something like that, then,

2317
02:19:21,400 --> 02:19:23,400
that's a little kind of- What about that guy who got the

2318
02:19:23,400 --> 02:19:25,400
Romney tattoos all over the

2319
02:19:25,400 --> 02:19:27,400
internet this week? I'm actually checking with one of my

2320
02:19:27,400 --> 02:19:29,400
favorite sites ever, Freakonomics.

2321
02:19:29,400 --> 02:19:31,400
I love Freakonomics.

2322
02:19:31,400 --> 02:19:33,400
Um, they're basically going

2323
02:19:33,400 --> 02:19:35,400
on here, and they're going over that case, they're talking about

2324
02:19:35,400 --> 02:19:37,400
the hangover part two, um,

2325
02:19:37,400 --> 02:19:39,400
about the art appearing without the

2326
02:19:39,400 --> 02:19:41,400
artist's consent.

2327
02:19:41,400 --> 02:19:43,400
Um, okay.

2328
02:19:43,400 --> 02:19:45,400
Alright, if the film-

2329
02:19:45,400 --> 02:19:47,400
I'm gonna read this paragraph here.

2330
02:19:47,400 --> 02:19:49,400
If the film had featured an etching by

2331
02:19:49,400 --> 02:19:51,400
Whitmill, who's the guy, the studio

2332
02:19:51,400 --> 02:19:53,400
would have had to get the rights to show it, and the film

2333
02:19:53,400 --> 02:19:55,400
cleared. That is approved by the copyright owner.

2334
02:19:55,400 --> 02:19:57,400
That clearance process is a major headache

2335
02:19:57,400 --> 02:19:59,400
for a lot of filmmakers, especially documentarians

2336
02:19:59,400 --> 02:20:01,400
who film real life, and

2337
02:20:01,400 --> 02:20:03,400
therefore capture things like songs, TV shows,

2338
02:20:03,400 --> 02:20:05,400
and artwork. The same rule applies to

2339
02:20:05,400 --> 02:20:07,400
the tattoo. So far, so good for

2340
02:20:07,400 --> 02:20:09,400
Whitmill. Okay. And then,

2341
02:20:09,400 --> 02:20:11,400
so they're basically using it

2342
02:20:11,400 --> 02:20:13,400
as that. Now, they're asking, does Warner Brothers

2343
02:20:13,400 --> 02:20:15,400
have a way out? The studio may claim that the tattoo

2344
02:20:15,400 --> 02:20:17,400
is not original, that it was inspired by

2345
02:20:17,400 --> 02:20:19,400
Maori tattoos. Um,

2346
02:20:19,400 --> 02:20:21,400
this is unlikely to work. Copyright's

2347
02:20:21,400 --> 02:20:23,400
originality threshold is very low. Even

2348
02:20:23,400 --> 02:20:25,400
if Whitmill adapted his design

2349
02:20:25,400 --> 02:20:27,400
from one in the public domain, it will

2350
02:20:27,400 --> 02:20:29,400
nonetheless be copyrightable if not

2351
02:20:29,400 --> 02:20:31,400
copied exactly. If it

2352
02:20:31,400 --> 02:20:33,400
is not copied exactly.

2353
02:20:33,400 --> 02:20:35,400
Alright, before we move on to the mailbag,

2354
02:20:35,400 --> 02:20:37,400
anything? Oh. One last thing. Uh-huh.

2355
02:20:37,400 --> 02:20:39,400
They say that it is also, though, quite

2356
02:20:39,400 --> 02:20:41,400
likely protected under fair use doctrine.

2357
02:20:41,400 --> 02:20:43,400
Oh.

2358
02:20:43,400 --> 02:20:45,400
Mm. Interesting.

2359
02:20:45,400 --> 02:20:47,400
Um. I voted for Freakonomics on Podcast

2360
02:20:47,400 --> 02:20:49,400
Awards.

2361
02:20:49,400 --> 02:20:51,400
Best one in their category that I saw. I love

2362
02:20:51,400 --> 02:20:53,400
I actually had the Freakonomics

2363
02:20:53,400 --> 02:20:55,400
desk calendar. I used it for

2364
02:20:55,400 --> 02:20:57,400
three years. I would get it every

2365
02:20:57,400 --> 02:20:59,400
year. You learn a lot

2366
02:20:59,400 --> 02:21:01,400
from this website. Anyway, just saying.

2367
02:21:01,400 --> 02:21:03,400
But yeah, that came from Freakonomics.com

2368
02:21:03,400 --> 02:21:05,400
Um, copyright. Blah blah.

2369
02:21:05,400 --> 02:21:07,400
Alright.

2370
02:21:07,400 --> 02:21:09,400
Yeah, I was gonna ask the same question.

2371
02:21:09,400 --> 02:21:11,400
Why isn't this an issue on especially

2372
02:21:11,400 --> 02:21:13,400
pay-per-view, uh, mixed

2373
02:21:13,400 --> 02:21:15,400
martial arts, pay-per-view, uh,

2374
02:21:15,400 --> 02:21:17,400
UFC broadcasts? Um,

2375
02:21:17,400 --> 02:21:19,400
you know, licensing. God

2376
02:21:19,400 --> 02:21:21,400
only knows what happens behind the scenes, but I'm

2377
02:21:21,400 --> 02:21:23,400
surprised that this hasn't come up before.

2378
02:21:23,400 --> 02:21:25,400
Um, scary situation.

2379
02:21:25,400 --> 02:21:27,400
The, before having

2380
02:21:27,400 --> 02:21:29,400
known those details, I was gonna say

2381
02:21:29,400 --> 02:21:31,400
flat out that this is, this is

2382
02:21:31,400 --> 02:21:33,400
Carlos Condit's problems, and he's on the hook

2383
02:21:33,400 --> 02:21:35,400
for this problem for any license

2384
02:21:35,400 --> 02:21:37,400
agreement broken or otherwise.

2385
02:21:37,400 --> 02:21:39,400
I kind of agree with you, is that,

2386
02:21:39,400 --> 02:21:41,400
you know, before you get a piece of art

2387
02:21:41,400 --> 02:21:43,400
permanently put on your body, you better think about

2388
02:21:43,400 --> 02:21:45,400
who owns that art. And you wanna say that

2389
02:21:45,400 --> 02:21:47,400
at the same time, you wanna say

2390
02:21:47,400 --> 02:21:49,400
original or not, it's a tattoo

2391
02:21:49,400 --> 02:21:51,400
and it's there. Unless you're getting it on

2392
02:21:51,400 --> 02:21:53,400
your butt where no one will ever see it.

2393
02:21:53,400 --> 02:21:55,400
But special people. Clearly not the

2394
02:21:55,400 --> 02:21:57,400
case in this situation, but of course.

2395
02:21:57,400 --> 02:21:59,400
Yeah, I, that, this is a,

2396
02:21:59,400 --> 02:22:01,400
that's a, that's a really crappy situation.

2397
02:22:01,400 --> 02:22:03,400
I, not having the expertise,

2398
02:22:03,400 --> 02:22:05,400
I don't really wanna comment anymore, but that's a scary thought.

2399
02:22:05,400 --> 02:22:07,400
I do still think it's a case of money-grabbing.

2400
02:22:07,400 --> 02:22:09,400
I'm gonna get the copyright Mike Tyson

2401
02:22:09,400 --> 02:22:11,400
tattoo on my butt and no one will ever

2402
02:22:11,400 --> 02:22:13,400
know, and I'll get away with a crime.

2403
02:22:13,400 --> 02:22:15,400
You know what's gonna happen is

2404
02:22:15,400 --> 02:22:17,400
that THQ, somebody is gonna shell out

2405
02:22:17,400 --> 02:22:19,400
damages and there's gonna be a patch that's gonna

2406
02:22:19,400 --> 02:22:21,400
be devoted to removing this in-game. Period.

2407
02:22:21,400 --> 02:22:23,400
That's, that's the era we live in.

2408
02:22:23,400 --> 02:22:25,400
You know that there's gonna be a patch that adds in

2409
02:22:25,400 --> 02:22:27,400
a special copyright notice.

2410
02:22:27,400 --> 02:22:29,400
Or licensed from

2411
02:22:29,400 --> 02:22:31,400
A 1K patch with tensed alterations.

2412
02:22:31,400 --> 02:22:33,400
This is all time that THQ could spend

2413
02:22:33,400 --> 02:22:35,400
working on like something to make them money.

2414
02:22:35,400 --> 02:22:37,400
Something to entertain people.

2415
02:22:37,400 --> 02:22:39,400
So, alright

2416
02:22:39,400 --> 02:22:41,400
let's go to the mailbag. Every week you guys

2417
02:22:41,400 --> 02:22:43,400
send us emails. Mailbag at

2418
02:22:43,400 --> 02:22:45,400
orangelaunchradio.com and we read

2419
02:22:45,400 --> 02:22:47,400
some of our favorites here on the show.

2420
02:22:47,400 --> 02:22:49,400
DarkSakura has asked me to dive

2421
02:22:49,400 --> 02:22:51,400
into the mailbag tonight and I said

2422
02:22:51,400 --> 02:22:53,400
sure! Why not?

2423
02:22:53,400 --> 02:22:55,400
I'll get my hands dirty. The price?

2424
02:22:55,400 --> 02:22:57,400
Why didn't KZDM?

2425
02:22:57,400 --> 02:22:59,400
Alright.

2426
02:22:59,400 --> 02:23:01,400
Let's go to

2427
02:23:01,400 --> 02:23:03,400
Redertainment who sends us our first email tonight.

2428
02:23:03,400 --> 02:23:05,400
Greetings podcrafters!

2429
02:23:05,400 --> 02:23:07,400
Over the past couple days I've experienced a

2430
02:23:07,400 --> 02:23:09,400
problem playing Assassin's Creed 3 on

2431
02:23:09,400 --> 02:23:11,400
the 360. When I turn on my 360

2432
02:23:11,400 --> 02:23:13,400
to play the game, I see

2433
02:23:13,400 --> 02:23:15,400
a screen saying open tray

2434
02:23:15,400 --> 02:23:17,400
where I should be seeing the screen where

2435
02:23:17,400 --> 02:23:19,400
play game screen usually appears.

2436
02:23:19,400 --> 02:23:21,400
It takes a couple times of me opening

2437
02:23:21,400 --> 02:23:23,400
and closing the 360 DVD tray to get

2438
02:23:23,400 --> 02:23:25,400
the play Assassin's Creed 3 screen to come up.

2439
02:23:25,400 --> 02:23:27,400
I do not believe this is a problem

2440
02:23:27,400 --> 02:23:29,400
with the DVD drive as other games

2441
02:23:29,400 --> 02:23:31,400
WWE 13, Dragon Age Origins

2442
02:23:31,400 --> 02:23:33,400
Rockstar Table Tennis appear as normal.

2443
02:23:33,400 --> 02:23:35,400
Neither do I experience

2444
02:23:35,400 --> 02:23:37,400
this issue with any other DVDs or

2445
02:23:37,400 --> 02:23:39,400
CDs I've put into the DVD drive recently.

2446
02:23:39,400 --> 02:23:41,400
Only Assassin's Creed 3 on

2447
02:23:41,400 --> 02:23:43,400
Xbox 360 has given me this problem.

2448
02:23:43,400 --> 02:23:45,400
My 360 is unmodded so that's not

2449
02:23:45,400 --> 02:23:47,400
the problem. Also the Assassin's Creed

2450
02:23:47,400 --> 02:23:49,400
3 game disc does not appear to be

2451
02:23:49,400 --> 02:23:51,400
broken, scratched, warped, chipped or otherwise

2452
02:23:51,400 --> 02:23:53,400
damaged. I've tried searching around

2453
02:23:53,400 --> 02:23:55,400
online and can't find anyone else experiencing

2454
02:23:55,400 --> 02:23:57,400
this problem. Or at least no one

2455
02:23:57,400 --> 02:23:59,400
online is bitching about this problem.

2456
02:23:59,400 --> 02:24:01,400
Am I an anomaly or is

2457
02:24:01,400 --> 02:24:03,400
anyone else experiencing this problem

2458
02:24:03,400 --> 02:24:05,400
with Assassin's Creed 3 on the 360?

2459
02:24:05,400 --> 02:24:07,400
Stay black, Redertainment.

2460
02:24:07,400 --> 02:24:09,400
Have you tried turning it off and

2461
02:24:09,400 --> 02:24:11,400
back on again? Sorry.

2462
02:24:11,400 --> 02:24:13,400
I would say if you're still having

2463
02:24:13,400 --> 02:24:15,400
trouble doing that maybe try launching it

2464
02:24:15,400 --> 02:24:17,400
from one of the quick launch menus.

2465
02:24:17,400 --> 02:24:19,400
Or hit the guide button. You can launch games

2466
02:24:19,400 --> 02:24:21,400
I think through that as well. But the quick launch menu

2467
02:24:21,400 --> 02:24:23,400
will allow you to launch it as well.

2468
02:24:23,400 --> 02:24:25,400
I have actually had this problem

2469
02:24:25,400 --> 02:24:27,400
happen. And not on Assassin's Creed 3

2470
02:24:27,400 --> 02:24:29,400
but another game. And

2471
02:24:29,400 --> 02:24:31,400
there were a lot of fingerprints on

2472
02:24:31,400 --> 02:24:33,400
the disc. Now I know you said you checked

2473
02:24:33,400 --> 02:24:35,400
out your disc and it seems to be clean.

2474
02:24:35,400 --> 02:24:37,400
I'm wondering if

2475
02:24:37,400 --> 02:24:39,400
it's something where you can't see it.

2476
02:24:39,400 --> 02:24:41,400
Disc rot.

2477
02:24:41,400 --> 02:24:43,400
Well it's Assassin's Creed 3.

2478
02:24:43,400 --> 02:24:45,400
I mean that just came out.

2479
02:24:45,400 --> 02:24:47,400
I guess you never know. You never know.

2480
02:24:47,400 --> 02:24:49,400
Hey, there were whole laser discs that had disc rot at shipping.

2481
02:24:49,400 --> 02:24:51,400
If you have the ability to do so

2482
02:24:51,400 --> 02:24:53,400
I would just install the game

2483
02:24:53,400 --> 02:24:55,400
to your drive to be safe.

2484
02:24:55,400 --> 02:24:57,400
Granted you still need the game to boot

2485
02:24:57,400 --> 02:24:59,400
the file but I think you'll have a little more

2486
02:24:59,400 --> 02:25:01,400
luck there. Otherwise

2487
02:25:01,400 --> 02:25:03,400
I would clean the disc

2488
02:25:03,400 --> 02:25:05,400
anyway. You might not

2489
02:25:05,400 --> 02:25:07,400
be able to see it. And clearly you've already

2490
02:25:07,400 --> 02:25:09,400
established it's not your 360.

2491
02:25:09,400 --> 02:25:11,400
It's the disc.

2492
02:25:11,400 --> 02:25:13,400
And I don't know an Assassin's Creed 3

2493
02:25:13,400 --> 02:25:15,400
so it was another game. Try it in another person's

2494
02:25:15,400 --> 02:25:17,400
system to see if it's actually the disc.

2495
02:25:17,400 --> 02:25:19,400
I actually want to say it was Mass Effect 2.

2496
02:25:19,400 --> 02:25:21,400
Because I bought that used.

2497
02:25:21,400 --> 02:25:23,400
And Mass Effect 2 is fucking up all the games.

2498
02:25:23,400 --> 02:25:25,400
Seriously.

2499
02:25:25,400 --> 02:25:27,400
I'm pissed off at my Mass Effect 2

2500
02:25:27,400 --> 02:25:29,400
because I have the version that it does with a launcher

2501
02:25:29,400 --> 02:25:31,400
and now I can't use text mod at the end.

2502
02:25:31,400 --> 02:25:33,400
Don't. Alright let's go to

2503
02:25:33,400 --> 02:25:35,400
an email from Ramaditya

2504
02:25:35,400 --> 02:25:37,400
from Indonesia.

2505
02:25:37,400 --> 02:25:39,400
Hi guys it's Ramaditya from Indonesia.

2506
02:25:39,400 --> 02:25:41,400
I don't know if you've already

2507
02:25:41,400 --> 02:25:43,400
known about this. I believe you're familiar

2508
02:25:43,400 --> 02:25:45,400
with an NES game called Blaster Master

2509
02:25:45,400 --> 02:25:47,400
from Sunsoft. Oh yes.

2510
02:25:47,400 --> 02:25:49,400
One of my all time favorites.

2511
02:25:49,400 --> 02:25:51,400
You know what in fact now

2512
02:25:51,400 --> 02:25:53,400
that you brought it up. See now

2513
02:25:53,400 --> 02:25:55,400
I have to. Now I have to.

2514
02:25:55,400 --> 02:25:57,400
You brought it up.

2515
02:25:57,400 --> 02:25:59,400
So now I have to dig through

2516
02:25:59,400 --> 02:26:01,400
the folder. Well good that means the song will be stuck

2517
02:26:01,400 --> 02:26:03,400
in my head. Here you go.

2518
02:26:05,400 --> 02:26:11,400
Much better.

2519
02:26:11,400 --> 02:26:13,400
In fact it was one of my favorite games

2520
02:26:13,400 --> 02:26:15,400
when I was a child. Several days ago

2521
02:26:15,400 --> 02:26:17,400
I found out the info about

2522
02:26:17,400 --> 02:26:19,400
the hack version of Blaster Master.

2523
02:26:19,400 --> 02:26:21,400
The patch allows you to play

2524
02:26:21,400 --> 02:26:23,400
eight completely different levels from the game.

2525
02:26:23,400 --> 02:26:25,400
Because I cannot see

2526
02:26:25,400 --> 02:26:27,400
so it's impossible to tell you how good or bad

2527
02:26:27,400 --> 02:26:29,400
it is. But my girlfriend the one that

2528
02:26:29,400 --> 02:26:31,400
tried the game informed me it was great.

2529

which I. My first

2532
02:26:37,400 --> 02:26:39,400
reaction was that site's still

2533
02:26:39,400 --> 02:26:41,400
around. I remember

2534
02:26:41,400 --> 02:26:43,400
hanging out in IRC chat rooms that

2535
02:26:43,400 --> 02:26:45,400
Zofar was in. That was years. I was in college

2536
02:26:45,400 --> 02:26:47,400
then okay. Last I knew Zofar

2537
02:26:47,400 --> 02:26:49,400
was ad bombed and scary

2538
02:26:49,400 --> 02:26:51,400
as a result to go to it. Zofar's

2539
02:26:51,400 --> 02:26:53,400
got to be my age.

2540
02:26:53,400 --> 02:26:55,400
At least. He's mid 30's

2541
02:26:55,400 --> 02:26:57,400
for sure. Mr. International House of

2542
02:26:57,400 --> 02:26:59,400
Brahms. Anyhow

2543
02:26:59,400 --> 02:27:01,400

2544
02:27:01,400 --> 02:27:03,400

02:27:03,400 --> 02:27:05,400
the game trailer and the patch itself.

2546
02:27:05,400 --> 02:27:07,400
So hope it blasts your day.

2547
02:27:07,400 --> 02:27:09,400
Now the link here is kind of lengthy

2548
02:27:09,400 --> 02:27:11,400
so I'll just tell you to go to Zofar at

2549
02:27:11,400 --> 02:27:13,400
Z-O-P-H-A-R

2550
02:27:13,400 --> 02:27:15,400
dot net if you didn't already know. And look for

2551
02:27:15,400 --> 02:27:17,400
Blaster Remaster.

2552
02:27:17,400 --> 02:27:19,400
A lot of people in the emulation scene did

2553
02:27:19,400 --> 02:27:21,400
this shit with like Mario Brothers. I

2554
02:27:21,400 --> 02:27:23,400
can't tell you. When hacking and sprite changing

2555
02:27:23,400 --> 02:27:25,400
when Nesticle implemented

2556
02:27:25,400 --> 02:27:27,400
and yes that's what it was called.

2557
02:27:27,400 --> 02:27:29,400
When Nesticle implemented the sprite changing

2558
02:27:29,400 --> 02:27:31,400
abilities Super

2559
02:27:31,400 --> 02:27:33,400
Penis Brothers was out within minutes.

2560
02:27:33,400 --> 02:27:35,400
Like everybody

2561
02:27:35,400 --> 02:27:37,400
did basic hacks to the game.

2562
02:27:37,400 --> 02:27:39,400
But they got like more and more and more in depth

2563
02:27:39,400 --> 02:27:41,400
and now you've got all these level changes.

2564
02:27:41,400 --> 02:27:43,400
Did you ever remember the

2565
02:27:43,400 --> 02:27:45,400
Metroid level

2566
02:27:45,400 --> 02:27:47,400
editor that they made? Oh yeah.

2567
02:27:47,400 --> 02:27:49,400
And there's actually several now

2568
02:27:49,400 --> 02:27:51,400
whole new versions of Metroid.

2569
02:27:51,400 --> 02:27:53,400
Classic Metroid that different layouts and

2570
02:27:53,400 --> 02:27:55,400
everything that are really well done.

2571
02:27:55,400 --> 02:27:57,400
Well thank you for a blast

2572
02:27:57,400 --> 02:27:59,400
in the past. Maybe it'll be better than that

2573
02:27:59,400 --> 02:28:01,400
Wii version they did

2574
02:28:01,400 --> 02:28:03,400
some time ago. There you go.

2575
02:28:03,400 --> 02:28:05,400
Ramaditya from Indonesia.

2576
02:28:05,400 --> 02:28:07,400
I love being in an international show.

2577
02:28:07,400 --> 02:28:09,400
Alright moving on.

2578
02:28:09,400 --> 02:28:11,400
Let's see. Here's a cheap

2579
02:28:11,400 --> 02:28:13,400
plug from Travis H.

2580
02:28:13,400 --> 02:28:15,400
This is worth mentioning because it has

2581
02:28:15,400 --> 02:28:17,400
to do with our old favorite pastime.

2582
02:28:17,400 --> 02:28:19,400
Travis H. sent us a plug here.

2583
02:28:19,400 --> 02:28:21,400
I will attempt the DDR

2584
02:28:21,400 --> 02:28:23,400
marathon record again on

2585
02:28:23,400 --> 02:28:25,400
November 23rd at 5 AM

2586
02:28:25,400 --> 02:28:27,400
Eastern to November 24th

2587
02:28:27,400 --> 02:28:29,400
to 9 PM Eastern. But this time

2588
02:28:29,400 --> 02:28:31,400
on Doubles Play.

2589
02:28:31,400 --> 02:28:33,400
He links

2590
02:28:33,400 --> 02:28:35,400
to an event on Facebook and

2591
02:28:35,400 --> 02:28:37,400
something called crowdrise.com

2592
02:28:37,400 --> 02:28:39,400
slash DDR world

2593
02:28:39,400 --> 02:28:41,400
record. So he's doing

2594
02:28:41,400 --> 02:28:43,400
the record. Is it for charity?

2595
02:28:43,400 --> 02:28:45,400
That's what I want to know. He's going to do it in Knoxville, Tennessee.

2596
02:28:45,400 --> 02:28:47,400
Ah here we go.

2597
02:28:47,400 --> 02:28:49,400
It is for charity. He raised $1000 for

2598
02:28:49,400 --> 02:28:51,400
local charity through the event. He wants

2599
02:28:51,400 --> 02:28:53,400
to double his results this year.

2600
02:28:53,400 --> 02:28:55,400
Rescue ministries meals.

2601
02:28:55,400 --> 02:28:57,400
I will be pledging two meals

2602
02:28:57,400 --> 02:28:59,400
per one hour that I compete. Well at least

2603
02:28:59,400 --> 02:29:01,400
it's for a good cause at the end of the day.

2604
02:29:01,400 --> 02:29:03,400
So I'm all

2605
02:29:03,400 --> 02:29:05,400
for everybody trying to one up each other on

2606
02:29:05,400 --> 02:29:07,400
these marathons and Guinness Book of World Records

2607
02:29:07,400 --> 02:29:09,400
and stuff when it's for charity. So good on you.

2608
02:29:09,400 --> 02:29:11,400
Speaking of charity, am I not

2609
02:29:11,400 --> 02:29:13,400
correct? Desert Bus started again

2610
02:29:13,400 --> 02:29:15,400
this weekend. Really? Yes.

2611
02:29:15,400 --> 02:29:17,400
Fine. Desert Bus is going. Umlaut's

2612
02:29:17,400 --> 02:29:19,400
coming up of course. You've heard Jamie

2613
02:29:19,400 --> 02:29:21,400
talk about that. God yes. I'm

2614
02:29:21,400 --> 02:29:23,400
still working on badges. It's

2615
02:29:23,400 --> 02:29:25,400
that time of year for child's play.

2616
02:29:25,400 --> 02:29:27,400
By the way, I want to let you

2617
02:29:27,400 --> 02:29:29,400
know that I was watching some Guinness World Records stuff.

2618
02:29:29,400 --> 02:29:31,400
They fit 28 women into a mini.

2619
02:29:31,400 --> 02:29:33,400
Wow.

2620
02:29:33,400 --> 02:29:35,400
I know. I'm like why do people think that this

2621
02:29:35,400 --> 02:29:37,400
is record worthy? Oh

2622
02:29:37,400 --> 02:29:39,400
and the longest note on the didgeridoo was

2623
02:29:39,400 --> 02:29:41,400
won by a 14 year old. Just saying.

2624
02:29:41,400 --> 02:29:43,400
I miss

2625
02:29:43,400 --> 02:29:45,400
didgeridoos.

2626
02:29:45,400 --> 02:29:47,400
I miss techno didgeridoo.

2627
02:29:47,400 --> 02:29:49,400
Remember that? That was a thing on OLR

2628
02:29:49,400 --> 02:29:51,400
years ago. I wanted

2629
02:29:51,400 --> 02:29:53,400
to bring up the didgeridoo for that.

2630
02:29:53,400 --> 02:29:55,400
Quick charity is something

2631
02:29:55,400 --> 02:29:57,400
that's interesting and actually the reason

2632
02:29:57,400 --> 02:29:59,400
I mentioned that I've been out here in California for over a week

2633
02:29:59,400 --> 02:30:01,400
and I wasn't on last week's show because my

2634
02:30:01,400 --> 02:30:03,400
employer held a dodgeball

2635
02:30:03,400 --> 02:30:05,400
charity tournament for

2636
02:30:05,400 --> 02:30:07,400
it was basically a who's who of the

2637
02:30:07,400 --> 02:30:09,400
startups and you know Silicon Valley

2638
02:30:09,400 --> 02:30:11,400
mostly San Francisco area

2639
02:30:11,400 --> 02:30:13,400
competitors and it was a whole hell of a lot of

2640
02:30:13,400 --> 02:30:15,400
fun. I believe it was 60,000

2641
02:30:15,400 --> 02:30:17,400
for local San Francisco charities.

2642
02:30:17,400 --> 02:30:19,400
It was

2643
02:30:19,400 --> 02:30:21,400
you know dodgeball. What experience

2644
02:30:21,400 --> 02:30:23,400
do we have from dodgeball?

2645
02:30:23,400 --> 02:30:25,400
The NES version that was amazing and

2646
02:30:25,400 --> 02:30:27,400
Jim and this was

2647
02:30:27,400 --> 02:30:29,400
there were 20 teams. It was a

2648
02:30:29,400 --> 02:30:31,400
Neo Geo game too which was

2649
02:30:31,400 --> 02:30:33,400
amazing. 20

2650
02:30:33,400 --> 02:30:35,400
20 teams of

2651
02:30:35,400 --> 02:30:37,400
across 17 businesses

2652
02:30:37,400 --> 02:30:39,400
a whole day's worth of fun.

2653
02:30:39,400 --> 02:30:41,400
It was amazing and even the

2654
02:30:41,400 --> 02:30:43,400
World Dodgeball Society came out to officiate

2655
02:30:43,400 --> 02:30:45,400
it and everything. It was a great time.

2656
02:30:45,400 --> 02:30:47,400
Dodgeball was a fun game.

2657
02:30:47,400 --> 02:30:49,400
That was one of my favorites growing up. Absolutely.

2658
02:30:49,400 --> 02:30:51,400
Alright. You ready to get taken back

2659
02:30:51,400 --> 02:30:53,400
with this inside joke?

2660
02:31:03,400 --> 02:31:05,400
We're all dancing. I want the DDR guy to dance to that.

2661
02:31:09,400 --> 02:31:11,400
If I'm ever a wrestler that's

2662
02:31:11,400 --> 02:31:13,400
the music I'm coming out to.

2663
02:31:13,400 --> 02:31:15,400
Alright. Last email tonight from

2664
02:31:15,400 --> 02:31:17,400
Elliot B.

2665
02:31:43,400 --> 02:31:45,400
Elliot B.

2666
02:31:45,400 --> 02:31:47,400
I had no idea that series

2667
02:31:47,400 --> 02:31:49,400
was 10 years old but it makes

2668
02:31:49,400 --> 02:31:51,400
perfect sense. You know

2669
02:31:51,400 --> 02:31:53,400
if Virtual Console on

2670
02:31:53,400 --> 02:31:55,400
Wii U were to start making GameCube

2671
02:31:55,400 --> 02:31:57,400
games show up which isn't outside the realm

2672
02:31:57,400 --> 02:31:59,400
of possibility. That's very possible.

2673
02:31:59,400 --> 02:32:01,400
Metroid Prime would sure be a

2674
02:32:01,400 --> 02:32:03,400
prime candidate to kick things

2675
02:32:03,400 --> 02:32:05,400
off.

2676
02:32:09,400 --> 02:32:11,400
Elliot's regretting that he sent that email.

2677
02:32:13,400 --> 02:32:15,400
Anyhow.

2678
02:32:15,400 --> 02:32:17,400
That's it for

2679
02:32:17,400 --> 02:32:19,400
emails this week. Mailbag at

2680
02:32:19,400 --> 02:32:21,400
orangeloungeradio.com

2681
02:32:21,400 --> 02:32:23,400
A few more stories for you guys and then

2682
02:32:23,400 --> 02:32:25,400
the uh... Will he be having the Metroid

2683
02:32:25,400 --> 02:32:27,400
primaries?

2684
02:32:29,400 --> 02:32:31,400
Yeah. He's really regretting sending that email.

2685
02:32:31,400 --> 02:32:33,400
You know we're gonna have an empty mailbag again next

2686
02:32:33,400 --> 02:32:35,400
week and we're gonna say why isn't anybody emailing us?

2687
02:32:35,400 --> 02:32:37,400
Oh yeah because we always tell the stupidest

2688
02:32:37,400 --> 02:32:39,400
jokes. Alright.

2689
02:32:39,400 --> 02:32:41,400
Let's get. Now would be an appropriate

2690
02:32:41,400 --> 02:32:43,400
time to do the FUs of the week.

2691
02:32:59,400 --> 02:33:01,400
FUs of the week. Dark Sakura.

2692
02:33:01,400 --> 02:33:03,400
FU to uh...

2693
02:33:03,400 --> 02:33:05,400
me not having a cat.

2694
02:33:05,400 --> 02:33:07,400
I really want a cat.

2695
02:33:07,400 --> 02:33:09,400
My husband says that we can't get a

2696
02:33:09,400 --> 02:33:11,400
cat until we buy a house. So he better

2697
02:33:11,400 --> 02:33:13,400
hurry up and buy me a house so I can get a cat.

2698
02:33:13,400 --> 02:33:15,400
At the end.

2699
02:33:17,400 --> 02:33:19,400
I don't know. I really don't have anything I

2700
02:33:19,400 --> 02:33:21,400
can be angry about. I guess FUs

2701
02:33:21,400 --> 02:33:23,400
of the fact that earlier this week I had to take

2702
02:33:23,400 --> 02:33:25,400
a few days off work because my car was

2703
02:33:25,400 --> 02:33:27,400
broken. But it doesn't matter anymore

2704
02:33:27,400 --> 02:33:29,400
because I have a different car. So.

2705
02:33:29,400 --> 02:33:31,400
Ha. Congrats.

2706
02:33:31,400 --> 02:33:33,400
We're Honda buddies. Yeah. Honda.

2707
02:33:33,400 --> 02:33:35,400
Is it a DeLorean? It's not a DeLorean.

2708
02:33:35,400 --> 02:33:37,400
I will be happy with my

2709
02:33:37,400 --> 02:33:39,400
Ponte Yoda.

2710
02:33:39,400 --> 02:33:41,400
Um.

2711
02:33:41,400 --> 02:33:43,400
FU to the utter

2712
02:33:43,400 --> 02:33:45,400
lack of self control that I have

2713
02:33:45,400 --> 02:33:47,400
and my credit card bill next month.

2714
02:33:47,400 --> 02:33:49,400
But yay to those reward

2715
02:33:49,400 --> 02:33:51,400
points. Uh.

2716
02:33:51,400 --> 02:33:53,400
Jason. Um.

2717
02:33:53,400 --> 02:33:55,400
FU to not

2718
02:33:55,400 --> 02:33:57,400
having a car because we're down to one and Brian

2719
02:33:57,400 --> 02:33:59,400
actually has to drive to work.

2720
02:33:59,400 --> 02:34:01,400
FU to Wells Fargo for

2721
02:34:01,400 --> 02:34:03,400
reasons that I don't really need to go into but are probably

2722
02:34:03,400 --> 02:34:05,400
completely obvious. I can

2723
02:34:05,400 --> 02:34:07,400
guess based on the FU. Yeah. And related

2724
02:34:07,400 --> 02:34:09,400
to that FU did $2 keyboards and

2725
02:34:09,400 --> 02:34:11,400
$50 computers. Those you know people

2726
02:34:11,400 --> 02:34:13,400
places like Wells Fargo that have to buy

2727
02:34:13,400 --> 02:34:15,400
these cheap ass little computers because everything

2728
02:34:15,400 --> 02:34:17,400
runs in a web browser. I hate those

2729
02:34:17,400 --> 02:34:19,400
keyboards. I don't know if it's

2730
02:34:19,400 --> 02:34:21,400
just ingrained to me because

2731
02:34:21,400 --> 02:34:23,400
I've always worked desk computer

2732
02:34:23,400 --> 02:34:25,400
keyboard jobs. But holy crap

2733
02:34:25,400 --> 02:34:27,400
you have a crappy keyboard and computers become

2734
02:34:27,400 --> 02:34:29,400
a thing that

2735
02:34:29,400 --> 02:34:31,400
an impossible thing.

2736
02:34:31,400 --> 02:34:33,400
Oh man. I did not

2737
02:34:33,400 --> 02:34:35,400
realize that that's ever something they would

2738
02:34:35,400 --> 02:34:37,400
say to me. Um.

2739
02:34:37,400 --> 02:34:39,400
FU to the

2740
02:34:39,400 --> 02:34:41,400
there's this bridge

2741
02:34:41,400 --> 02:34:43,400
near Berkeley north of the

2742
02:34:43,400 --> 02:34:45,400
Bay Bridge. Overpass rather north of the

2743
02:34:45,400 --> 02:34:47,400
Bay Bridge. And every time I've been

2744
02:34:47,400 --> 02:34:49,400
out here and come up towards Sacramento there's a sign

2745
02:34:49,400 --> 02:34:51,400
up there. Investigate 9-11.

2746
02:34:51,400 --> 02:34:53,400
Stop the war. I get the sentiment but

2747
02:34:53,400 --> 02:34:55,400
you're still up there. It's Berkeley.

2748
02:34:55,400 --> 02:34:57,400
Just wow.

2749
02:34:57,400 --> 02:34:59,400
No. It's Berkeley.

2750
02:34:59,400 --> 02:35:01,400
And related to that FU did

2751
02:35:01,400 --> 02:35:03,400
We love Berkeley but they bring

2752
02:35:03,400 --> 02:35:05,400
the crazy. And that's why we love them.

2753
02:35:05,400 --> 02:35:07,400
We need a little unpredictability in our life.

2754
02:35:07,400 --> 02:35:09,400
And related to that FU to the

2755
02:35:09,400 --> 02:35:11,400
Coney burned and carved into

2756
02:35:11,400 --> 02:35:13,400
the hillside that I saw going up here.

2757
02:35:13,400 --> 02:35:15,400
How many votes did he end up getting for president?

2758
02:35:17,400 --> 02:35:19,400
It's a joke. Wow. What?

2759
02:35:19,400 --> 02:35:21,400
Oh what? Was he

2760
02:35:21,400 --> 02:35:23,400
on the Colorado ballot like I was talking about?

2761
02:35:23,400 --> 02:35:25,400
He might have been. Did I miss something?

2762
02:35:25,400 --> 02:35:27,400
You haven't heard that joke? I just told like

2763
02:35:27,400 --> 02:35:29,400
the same joke that went around Twitter all day

2764
02:35:29,400 --> 02:35:31,400
after election. With all the bumper

2765
02:35:31,400 --> 02:35:33,400
stickers on cars how many votes

2766
02:35:33,400 --> 02:35:35,400
did he get in the election? Wow.

2767
02:35:35,400 --> 02:35:37,400
It's actually pretty good. Come on.

2768
02:35:37,400 --> 02:35:39,400
FU to me for being out of the scene.

2769
02:35:39,400 --> 02:35:41,400
Lastly

2770
02:35:41,400 --> 02:35:43,400
FU to the Wii U for sometimes just

2771
02:35:43,400 --> 02:35:45,400
not having button shortcuts

2772
02:35:45,400 --> 02:35:47,400
so you have to let go of the

2773
02:35:47,400 --> 02:35:49,400
controller tap on

2774
02:35:49,400 --> 02:35:51,400
I just haven't built it yet.

2775
02:35:51,400 --> 02:35:53,400
It I'm sure

2776
02:35:53,400 --> 02:35:55,400
will be patched but it's just it feels

2777
02:35:55,400 --> 02:35:57,400
weird. That's one of those doors that goes into a room

2778
02:35:57,400 --> 02:35:59,400
where surprise it's nothing. I can't wait

2779
02:35:59,400 --> 02:36:01,400
for the next five gigabyte patch so that'll

2780
02:36:01,400 --> 02:36:03,400
laugh. Sorry you

2781
02:36:03,400 --> 02:36:05,400
we owners that have the eight gigabyte model

2782
02:36:05,400 --> 02:36:07,400
you're just not going to be able to have the

2783
02:36:07,400 --> 02:36:09,400
shortcuts because it's another five gigabytes.

2784
02:36:09,400 --> 02:36:11,400
Good enough.

2785
02:36:11,400 --> 02:36:13,400
I still don't okay I still

2786
02:36:13,400 --> 02:36:15,400
don't understand Miiverse. I

2787
02:36:15,400 --> 02:36:17,400
can't just make a post to show

2788
02:36:17,400 --> 02:36:19,400
all my friends. Do you really? I have to post

2789
02:36:19,400 --> 02:36:21,400
in the like if I want to

2790
02:36:21,400 --> 02:36:23,400
show my cat I've got to go to

2791
02:36:23,400 --> 02:36:25,400
the Mass Effect 3 community and say hey

2792
02:36:25,400 --> 02:36:27,400
Mass Effect 3 community. I just want to

2793
02:36:27,400 --> 02:36:29,400
post a picture of my cat. Do you really

2794
02:36:29,400 --> 02:36:31,400
want a public Nintendo operated

2795
02:36:31,400 --> 02:36:33,400
Twitter clone though?

2796
02:36:33,400 --> 02:36:35,400
Well well

2797
02:36:35,400 --> 02:36:37,400
well

2798
02:36:37,400 --> 02:36:39,400
well it

2799
02:36:39,400 --> 02:36:41,400
offers me something that Twitter doesn't

2800
02:36:41,400 --> 02:36:43,400
and that is hand drawn

2801
02:36:43,400 --> 02:36:45,400
stylus messages. It sounds

2802
02:36:45,400 --> 02:36:47,400
to me that this whole

2803
02:36:47,400 --> 02:36:49,400
Miiverse thing is going to like kind of

2804
02:36:49,400 --> 02:36:51,400
devolve into some sort of like game

2805
02:36:51,400 --> 02:36:53,400
facts forum

2806
02:36:53,400 --> 02:36:55,400
to be fair

2807
02:36:55,400 --> 02:36:57,400
it works better than the

2808
02:36:57,400 --> 02:36:59,400
Vita's thing which I still

2809
02:36:59,400 --> 02:37:01,400
like I don't like you know the Vita has

2810
02:37:01,400 --> 02:37:03,400
that whole thing like you can see like what your

2811
02:37:03,400 --> 02:37:05,400
friends are doing and you can even comment on

2812
02:37:05,400 --> 02:37:07,400
posts. Nobody fucking knows

2813
02:37:07,400 --> 02:37:09,400
it's there. You probably don't even know what I'm

2814
02:37:09,400 --> 02:37:11,400
talking about. It's under the achievements

2815
02:37:11,400 --> 02:37:13,400
trophy screen. Like no no when you go into the

2816
02:37:13,400 --> 02:37:15,400
games you hit the little thing that says

2817
02:37:15,400 --> 02:37:17,400
down and it shows you the feed like so and so

2818
02:37:17,400 --> 02:37:19,400
just got this game. So and so unlocked

2819
02:37:19,400 --> 02:37:21,400
a trophy and you can actually like

2820
02:37:21,400 --> 02:37:23,400
or you know whatever the PlayStation version of

2821
02:37:23,400 --> 02:37:25,400
like is you can like

2822
02:37:25,400 --> 02:37:27,400
posts and comment and all that

2823
02:37:27,400 --> 02:37:29,400
shit like it was Facebook but no ain't

2824
02:37:29,400 --> 02:37:31,400
nobody reading it

2825
02:37:31,400 --> 02:37:33,400
because it's integrated very shitty

2826
02:37:33,400 --> 02:37:35,400
like like I'm going to go into each

2827
02:37:35,400 --> 02:37:37,400
individual game I own to look at the feed like

2828
02:37:37,400 --> 02:37:39,400
that should be to Nintendo's

2829
02:37:39,400 --> 02:37:41,400
credit at least that's the thing

2830
02:37:41,400 --> 02:37:43,400
that comes up when I turn my Nintendo

2831
02:37:43,400 --> 02:37:45,400
on. I looked at some

2832
02:37:45,400 --> 02:37:47,400
of those video game community feeds and it's

2833
02:37:47,400 --> 02:37:49,400
can I should I get this game

2834
02:37:49,400 --> 02:37:51,400
can somebody tell me if I should get this game

2835
02:37:51,400 --> 02:37:53,400
should I get this game. There were a

2836
02:37:53,400 --> 02:37:55,400
lot of really awesome

2837
02:37:55,400 --> 02:37:57,400
drawn art like I was I was

2838
02:37:57,400 --> 02:37:59,400
paging through Ninja Gaiden and there were a

2839
02:37:59,400 --> 02:38:01,400
bunch of like Ninja drawings and cheap jokes

2840
02:38:01,400 --> 02:38:03,400
that's the most detailed penis I've

2841
02:38:03,400 --> 02:38:05,400
ever seen. Yeah

2842
02:38:05,400 --> 02:38:07,400
Tiger Claw sent me a link saying are you

2843
02:38:07,400 --> 02:38:09,400
sure you want this to happen and then

2844
02:38:09,400 --> 02:38:11,400
of course you know tada

2845
02:38:11,400 --> 02:38:13,400
it's a penis drawn on the Wii U

2846
02:38:13,400 --> 02:38:15,400
what a shock series

2847
02:38:15,400 --> 02:38:17,400
looks like multiple penises actually a lot

2848
02:38:17,400 --> 02:38:19,400
that is their upside you know what

2849
02:38:19,400 --> 02:38:21,400
that's the banner of dick it's just

2850
02:38:21,400 --> 02:38:23,400
it's it's a drawing

2851
02:38:23,400 --> 02:38:25,400
of an alien planet where mushrooms

2852
02:38:25,400 --> 02:38:27,400
grow from the ceiling that's what it is

2853
02:38:27,400 --> 02:38:29,400
there are I still call it the banner

2854
02:38:29,400 --> 02:38:31,400
of dick there are cave

2855
02:38:31,400 --> 02:38:33,400
formations that do this I think it's funny that it's

2856
02:38:33,400 --> 02:38:35,400
under archery and swordplay

2857
02:38:41,400 --> 02:38:43,400
well played Bravo

2858
02:38:43,400 --> 02:38:45,400
does that make the TTP two hours

2859
02:38:45,400 --> 02:38:47,400
and forty five minutes

2860
02:38:51,400 --> 02:38:53,400
this is just one of those shows

2861
02:38:53,400 --> 02:38:55,400
all right Bravo JD

2862
02:38:55,400 --> 02:38:57,400
one Tiger

2863
02:38:57,400 --> 02:38:59,400
Claw suggests maybe it is Turian

2864
02:38:59,400 --> 02:39:01,400
genitalia I think

2865
02:39:01,400 --> 02:39:03,400
that Turian cock looks different than that

2866
02:39:03,400 --> 02:39:05,400
yeah that would imply that like Turians

2867
02:39:05,400 --> 02:39:07,400
pull down their pants and it's like an octopus

2868
02:39:07,400 --> 02:39:09,400
down there okay from those drawings that

2869
02:39:09,400 --> 02:39:11,400
would imply that Turians have

2870
02:39:11,400 --> 02:39:13,400
foreskins

2871
02:39:13,400 --> 02:39:15,400
moving on and

2872
02:39:15,400 --> 02:39:17,400
quickly

2873
02:39:17,400 --> 02:39:19,400
Loki what do you have for us

2874
02:39:19,400 --> 02:39:21,400
before we get we're up almost to the skype line

2875
02:39:21,400 --> 02:39:23,400
at one eight seven seven game OLR

2876
02:39:23,400 --> 02:39:25,400
we're on skype orange lounge radio we're

2877
02:39:25,400 --> 02:39:27,400
almost there but not just yet I don't have banners

2878
02:39:27,400 --> 02:39:29,400
of cocks unless that's a new game

2879
02:39:29,400 --> 02:39:31,400
franchise that they're gonna put out get out

2880
02:39:31,400 --> 02:39:33,400
but Ubisoft is

2881
02:39:33,400 --> 02:39:35,400
you know they may be interested in

2882
02:39:35,400 --> 02:39:37,400
thq's assets

2883
02:39:37,400 --> 02:39:39,400

2884
02:39:39,400 --> 02:39:41,400
their boss

2885
02:39:41,400 --> 02:39:43,400
is it Vess

2886
02:39:43,400 --> 02:39:45,400
I'm not even gonna try to pronounce it French guy

2887
02:39:45,400 --> 02:39:47,400
anyways

2888
02:39:47,400 --> 02:39:49,400
anyways he basically said

2889
02:39:49,400 --> 02:39:51,400
yeah they're always interested in good brands and

2890
02:39:51,400 --> 02:39:53,400
you know it may be something

2891
02:39:53,400 --> 02:39:55,400
they can consider buying some of the IP

2892
02:39:55,400 --> 02:39:57,400
from them

2893
02:39:57,400 --> 02:39:59,400
I think it's just all speculation that kind of go on

2894
02:39:59,400 --> 02:40:01,400
reaching out to people saying hey you know

2895
02:40:01,400 --> 02:40:03,400
what do you think

2896
02:40:03,400 --> 02:40:05,400
what do you think thq's assets

2897
02:40:05,400 --> 02:40:07,400
impact is gonna be on like you know

2898
02:40:07,400 --> 02:40:09,400
the neo geo console or

2899
02:40:09,400 --> 02:40:11,400
the dreamcast or something like that

2900
02:40:11,400 --> 02:40:13,400
but you know they're just

2901
02:40:13,400 --> 02:40:15,400
kind of reaching

2902
02:40:15,400 --> 02:40:17,400
obviously if they struggle enough then they're gonna try to

2903
02:40:17,400 --> 02:40:19,400
sell off IP but I think they've already

2904
02:40:19,400 --> 02:40:21,400
sold off IP or at least stop making

2905
02:40:21,400 --> 02:40:23,400
stuff I know they're still

2906
02:40:23,400 --> 02:40:25,400
sitting on a bunch of those you know you draw

2907
02:40:25,400 --> 02:40:27,400
tablets that's for sure

2908
02:40:27,400 --> 02:40:29,400
but

2909
02:40:29,400 --> 02:40:31,400
I don't know I think right now they've kind of

2910
02:40:31,400 --> 02:40:33,400
limited it down to what they're gonna work

2911
02:40:33,400 --> 02:40:35,400
with and they're gonna make some

2912
02:40:35,400 --> 02:40:37,400
quality games based on it or at least they're gonna

2913
02:40:37,400 --> 02:40:39,400
try and fail

2914
02:40:39,400 --> 02:40:41,400
but we'll see

2915
02:40:41,400 --> 02:40:43,400
I tell you one IP they're not

2916
02:40:43,400 --> 02:40:45,400
interested in right now

2917
02:40:45,400 --> 02:40:47,400
UFC Undisputed

2918
02:40:47,400 --> 02:40:49,400
well that's not theirs anymore

2919
02:40:49,400 --> 02:40:51,400
that would be EA

2920
02:40:51,400 --> 02:40:53,400
oh

2921
02:40:53,400 --> 02:40:55,400
well just kill that joke

2922
02:40:55,400 --> 02:40:57,400
they aren't interested in it

2923
02:40:57,400 --> 02:40:59,400
because EA bought it already

2924
02:41:01,400 --> 02:41:03,400
alrighty then

2925
02:41:03,400 --> 02:41:05,400
uh

2926
02:41:05,400 --> 02:41:07,400
I got one more story for you guys

2927
02:41:07,400 --> 02:41:09,400
and uh you know

2928
02:41:09,400 --> 02:41:11,400
I know this I know

2929
02:41:11,400 --> 02:41:13,400
that this is the reason that you guys tune in

2930
02:41:13,400 --> 02:41:15,400
to Orange Lounge Radio is that

2931
02:41:15,400 --> 02:41:17,400
you wanna have your news

2932
02:41:17,400 --> 02:41:19,400
on Beyonce

2933
02:41:19,400 --> 02:41:21,400
and I've got your Beyonce

2934
02:41:21,400 --> 02:41:23,400
news for you right here and it has to do

2935
02:41:23,400 --> 02:41:25,400
with that lawsuit that was going on

2936
02:41:25,400 --> 02:41:27,400
between Beyonce and

2937
02:41:27,400 --> 02:41:29,400
Gate 5 uh this was that

2938
02:41:29,400 --> 02:41:31,400
whole thing about Superstar Beyonce

2939
02:41:31,400 --> 02:41:33,400
that was gonna happen and then she backed out of the deal

2940
02:41:33,400 --> 02:41:35,400
so uh

2941
02:41:35,400 --> 02:41:37,400
here it is now the appeal

2942
02:41:37,400 --> 02:41:39,400
of the judgment

2943
02:41:39,400 --> 02:41:41,400
where Beyonce's lawyers tried

2944
02:41:41,400 --> 02:41:43,400
to basically get it thrown out

2945
02:41:43,400 --> 02:41:45,400
they wanted a summary judgment in April

2946
02:41:45,400 --> 02:41:47,400
saying that Gate 5 didn't pull in the financing

2947
02:41:47,400 --> 02:41:49,400
that appeal failed

2948
02:41:49,400 --> 02:41:51,400
this doesn't mean Beyonce has lost

2949
02:41:51,400 --> 02:41:53,400
but this means we're gonna get

2950
02:41:53,400 --> 02:41:55,400
the trial of the century

2951
02:41:55,400 --> 02:41:57,400
it's gonna go to trial and a jury

2952
02:41:57,400 --> 02:41:59,400
will deter if they don't settle first

2953
02:41:59,400 --> 02:42:01,400
yeah that was just like trial of the century

2954
02:42:01,400 --> 02:42:03,400
call duty and settle

2955
02:42:03,400 --> 02:42:05,400
where a jury will have to determine if Beyonce

2956
02:42:05,400 --> 02:42:07,400
was within her contract to leave the project

2957
02:42:07,400 --> 02:42:09,400
or if she broke the agreement

2958
02:42:09,400 --> 02:42:11,400
so uh we could get a trial

2959
02:42:11,400 --> 02:42:13,400
out of this that would be kinda fun

2960
02:42:13,400 --> 02:42:15,400
yeah it'll settle you know it'll settle

2961
02:42:17,400 --> 02:42:19,400
but all I gotta say

2962
02:42:19,400 --> 02:42:21,400
is man two keytars

2963
02:42:21,400 --> 02:42:23,400
that's just fancy

2964
02:42:23,400 --> 02:42:25,400
here's the thing we're looking at this little picture

2965
02:42:25,400 --> 02:42:27,400
of Beyonce doing her little sachet

2966
02:42:27,400 --> 02:42:29,400
like her one keyboard girl's really into it over here

2967
02:42:29,400 --> 02:42:31,400
but look at this one

2968
02:42:31,400 --> 02:42:33,400
this one that looks like Juliette Lewis with blonde hair

2969
02:42:33,400 --> 02:42:35,400
she looks like the chick

2970
02:42:35,400 --> 02:42:37,400
from Mean Girls or whatever

2971
02:42:37,400 --> 02:42:39,400
oh no no not Mean Girls

2972
02:42:39,400 --> 02:42:41,400
I'm sorry she looks like the chick from Glee

2973
02:42:41,400 --> 02:42:43,400
the one that always has the blank

2974
02:42:43,400 --> 02:42:45,400
oh Britney why do I know that

2975
02:42:45,400 --> 02:42:47,400
oh god you know what I can safely say

2976
02:42:47,400 --> 02:42:49,400
I've never seen an episode of that show

2977
02:42:49,400 --> 02:42:51,400
I am so gay

2978
02:42:51,400 --> 02:42:53,400
and I can say that

2979
02:42:53,400 --> 02:42:55,400
I watched part of the series

2980
02:42:55,400 --> 02:42:57,400
the first few seasons just because

2981
02:42:57,400 --> 02:42:59,400
it was by the guy that did Nip Tuck

2982
02:42:59,400 --> 02:43:01,400
although that series was weird

2983
02:43:01,400 --> 02:43:03,400
but yeah I got out of it after about

2984
02:43:03,400 --> 02:43:05,400
I think it's a couple scenes

2985
02:43:05,400 --> 02:43:07,400
I have seen one episode of Nip Tuck

2986
02:43:07,400 --> 02:43:09,400
that's where they put all the liposuction fat in the woman's car

2987
02:43:09,400 --> 02:43:11,400
that's the only episode I've seen

2988
02:43:11,400 --> 02:43:13,400
American Horror Story is much better

2989
02:43:13,400 --> 02:43:15,400
it's messed up

2990
02:43:15,400 --> 02:43:17,400
yeah it's also him

2991
02:43:17,400 --> 02:43:19,400
if you like the FX show

2992
02:43:19,400 --> 02:43:21,400
you'll like American Horror Story

2993
02:43:21,400 --> 02:43:23,400
which is also an FX show

2994
02:43:23,400 --> 02:43:25,400
alright

2995
02:43:25,400 --> 02:43:27,400
they're on season 2 even

2996
02:43:27,400 --> 02:43:29,400
yes so after all that

2997
02:43:29,400 --> 02:43:31,400
Beyonce and Glee news

2998
02:43:31,400 --> 02:43:33,400
we can finally go back to video games

2999
02:43:33,400 --> 02:43:35,400
and your phone calls

3000
02:43:35,400 --> 02:43:37,400
Skype line is open right now

3001
02:43:37,400 --> 02:43:39,400
1877

3002
02:43:39,400 --> 02:43:41,400
game

3003
02:43:41,400 --> 02:43:43,400
or our username on Skype

3004
02:43:43,400 --> 02:43:45,400
is Orange Launch Radio

3005
02:43:45,400 --> 02:43:47,400
all one word

3006
02:43:47,400 --> 02:43:49,400
I'll get to the twitter topics here in just a moment

3007
02:43:49,400 --> 02:43:51,400
but I thought I'd check in with Loki first

3008
02:43:52,400 --> 02:43:54,400
yeah this is kind of weird I guess

3009
02:43:54,400 --> 02:43:56,400
so Nintendo for your Nintendo ID if you're a minor

3010
02:43:56,400 --> 02:43:58,400
requires a credit card verification

3011
02:43:58,400 --> 02:44:00,400
that's going to cost you 50 cents

3012
02:44:00,400 --> 02:44:02,400
so which leads to the question

3013
02:44:02,400 --> 02:44:04,400
why don't you just say you're an adult

3014
02:44:04,400 --> 02:44:06,400
if you're a minor

3015
02:44:06,400 --> 02:44:08,400
save the fee and the hassle

3016
02:44:08,400 --> 02:44:11,400
which I'm sure most people will probably do

3017
02:44:11,400 --> 02:44:13,400
I wonder if that's a permanent thing

3018
02:44:13,400 --> 02:44:15,400
because stuff like that is usually

3019
02:44:15,400 --> 02:44:18,400
because Loki Reggie doesn't like liars

3020
02:44:18,400 --> 02:44:20,400
oh yeah I'm sure

3021
02:44:20,400 --> 02:44:22,400
all those kids too are very

3022
02:44:22,400 --> 02:44:24,400
you know they're very truthful

3023
02:44:24,400 --> 02:44:26,400
when it comes to those age gated videos as well

3024
02:44:26,400 --> 02:44:28,400
I'm sure no one says that they were born in like

3025
02:44:28,400 --> 02:44:30,400
the current date

3026
02:44:30,400 --> 02:44:32,400
or was it 1900

3027
02:44:32,400 --> 02:44:34,400
or something like that

3028
02:44:34,400 --> 02:44:36,400
when you go to xtube.com

3029
02:44:36,400 --> 02:44:38,400
sure I was January 1st 1900

3030
02:44:38,400 --> 02:44:40,400
yeah exactly

3031
02:44:40,400 --> 02:44:42,400
hey we gotta call on the line

3032
02:44:42,400 --> 02:44:44,400
Orange Lounge Radio who's this

3033
02:44:44,400 --> 02:44:46,400
Ron was back again

3034
02:44:46,400 --> 02:44:48,400
you again gotta go have a nice day

3035
02:44:48,400 --> 02:44:50,400
what's up buddy

3036
02:44:50,400 --> 02:44:52,400
not much um

3037
02:44:52,400 --> 02:44:54,400
you did bring Reggie to OLR

3038
02:44:54,400 --> 02:44:56,400
and ask him a really

3039
02:44:56,400 --> 02:44:58,400
dumb question and I mean that in like

3040
02:44:58,400 --> 02:45:00,400
a showgirls is dumb but I love it kind of way

3041
02:45:02,400 --> 02:45:04,400
so what's up buddy

3042
02:45:04,400 --> 02:45:06,400
something interesting

3043
02:45:06,400 --> 02:45:08,400
that happened with GameStop

3044
02:45:08,400 --> 02:45:10,400
and now with their current set of preorders

3045
02:45:10,400 --> 02:45:12,400
it seems that

3046
02:45:12,400 --> 02:45:14,400
my brother he went to preorder

3047
02:45:14,400 --> 02:45:16,400
his Wii paid off in full

3048
02:45:16,400 --> 02:45:18,400
he was going to have issues

3049
02:45:18,400 --> 02:45:20,400
picking it up because of work

3050
02:45:20,400 --> 02:45:22,400
and the store that's open

3051
02:45:22,400 --> 02:45:24,400
and the whole 48 hours thing

3052
02:45:24,400 --> 02:45:26,400
he was pretty much

3053
02:45:26,400 --> 02:45:28,400
told more or less that if he doesn't

3054
02:45:28,400 --> 02:45:30,400
pick it up in 48 hours

3055
02:45:30,400 --> 02:45:32,400
they're going to give it to somebody else

3056
02:45:34,400 --> 02:45:36,400
now it seems that

3057
02:45:36,400 --> 02:45:38,400
due to an issue with the

3058
02:45:38,400 --> 02:45:40,400
release of Assassin's Creed

3059
02:45:40,400 --> 02:45:42,400
it doesn't matter if

3060
02:45:42,400 --> 02:45:44,400
you preorder your game

3061
02:45:44,400 --> 02:45:46,400
or console and not paid in full or not

3062
02:45:46,400 --> 02:45:48,400
if somebody wants it

3063
02:45:48,400 --> 02:45:50,400
they can have it

3064
02:45:50,400 --> 02:45:52,400
well wait a minute he paid for it

3065
02:45:52,400 --> 02:45:54,400
in full already yes

3066
02:45:54,400 --> 02:45:56,400
but they're still threatening to give it away

3067
02:45:56,400 --> 02:45:58,400
isn't that give it away but

3068
02:45:58,400 --> 02:46:00,400
when he

3069
02:46:00,400 --> 02:46:02,400
can pick it up or whatever he'll get the

3070
02:46:02,400 --> 02:46:04,400
next one for like they're not

3071
02:46:04,400 --> 02:46:06,400
taking away his money right

3072
02:46:06,400 --> 02:46:08,400
no but the thing is

3073
02:46:08,400 --> 02:46:10,400
that

3074
02:46:10,400 --> 02:46:12,400
GameStop has now what's called no

3075
02:46:12,400 --> 02:46:14,400
person left behind

3076
02:46:14,400 --> 02:46:16,400
so that guarantees

3077
02:46:16,400 --> 02:46:18,400
even if you preorder it paid for it in

3078
02:46:18,400 --> 02:46:20,400
full if it's the last copy you're

3079
02:46:20,400 --> 02:46:22,400
coming to pick it up if someone beat

3080
02:46:22,400 --> 02:46:24,400
you by 10 minutes even though that's

3081
02:46:24,400 --> 02:46:26,400
your copy that

3082
02:46:26,400 --> 02:46:28,400
other person can walk out the store with it and you'll

3083
02:46:28,400 --> 02:46:30,400
have to wait till the next shipment and depending

3084
02:46:30,400 --> 02:46:32,400
on the game don't

3085
02:46:32,400 --> 02:46:34,400
know when it's coming then why are you

3086
02:46:34,400 --> 02:46:36,400
preordering

3087
02:46:36,400 --> 02:46:38,400
that's my point exactly

3088
02:46:38,400 --> 02:46:40,400
well yeah I mean I've never

3089
02:46:40,400 --> 02:46:42,400
been a big fan of the preorder system at all

3090
02:46:42,400 --> 02:46:44,400
I can't think of the last thing I preordered

3091
02:46:44,400 --> 02:46:46,400
and that's how I voice my

3092
02:46:46,400 --> 02:46:48,400
opinion I don't participate you didn't

3093
02:46:48,400 --> 02:46:50,400
preorder a Wii U I did not preorder a

3094
02:46:50,400 --> 02:46:52,400
Wii U I'm not sitting here going

3095
02:46:52,400 --> 02:46:54,400
nanny nanny poo poo I found one anyway

3096
02:46:54,400 --> 02:46:56,400
but I did find

3097
02:46:56,400 --> 02:46:58,400
one anyway

3098
02:46:58,400 --> 02:47:00,400
you know like it

3099
02:47:00,400 --> 02:47:02,400
could happen now you probably couldn't do it

3100
02:47:02,400 --> 02:47:04,400
now now that the day is over I don't think you're gonna find

3101
02:47:04,400 --> 02:47:06,400
one but they're

3102
02:47:06,400 --> 02:47:08,400
supposedly putting them out

3103
02:47:08,400 --> 02:47:10,400
more frequently but okay

3104
02:47:10,400 --> 02:47:12,400
I gotta go back to this so why

3105
02:47:12,400 --> 02:47:14,400
couldn't your friend get there within

3106
02:47:14,400 --> 02:47:16,400
48 hours?

3107
02:47:16,400 --> 02:47:18,400
my bro my brother sorry your brother

3108
02:47:18,400 --> 02:47:20,400
yeah his work schedule he

3109
02:47:20,400 --> 02:47:22,400
the game stopped he was able to pick it up but

3110
02:47:22,400 --> 02:47:24,400
today they will open

3111
02:47:24,400 --> 02:47:26,400
from 11 to 6 he works

3112
02:47:26,400 --> 02:47:28,400
11 to 7 and he's a 45

3113
02:47:28,400 --> 02:47:30,400
minute drive away

3114
02:47:30,400 --> 02:47:32,400
oh okay alright that makes

3115
02:47:32,400 --> 02:47:34,400
sense and especially with all the shenanigans

3116
02:47:34,400 --> 02:47:36,400
that have happened out there back east

3117
02:47:36,400 --> 02:47:38,400
I mean I'm sure they're still cleaning up some of the roads

3118
02:47:38,400 --> 02:47:40,400
oh

3119
02:47:40,400 --> 02:47:42,400
don't get me started about that

3120
02:47:42,400 --> 02:47:44,400
are they still rationing the gas and all that shit?

3121
02:47:44,400 --> 02:47:46,400
um and New York

3122
02:47:46,400 --> 02:47:48,400
City I think they still

3123
02:47:48,400 --> 02:47:50,400
are wow I'll have to double

3124
02:47:50,400 --> 02:47:52,400
check with that wow anyway

3125
02:47:52,400 --> 02:47:54,400
sorry didn't mean to change the topic on you

3126
02:47:54,400 --> 02:47:56,400
but um I do I

3127
02:47:56,400 --> 02:47:58,400
do feel like this isn't the first

3128
02:47:58,400 --> 02:48:00,400
I've heard of this policy I do

3129
02:48:00,400 --> 02:48:02,400
want to say GameStop has kind of done this before

3130
02:48:02,400 --> 02:48:04,400
where it's like well if you don't show up to get your stuff

3131
02:48:04,400 --> 02:48:06,400
we are going to give it to a customer

3132
02:48:06,400 --> 02:48:08,400
who's willing to you know show up and pay for it

3133
02:48:08,400 --> 02:48:10,400
I'm not saying it makes a right

3134
02:48:10,400 --> 02:48:12,400
I'm just saying I don't think this is necessarily

3135
02:48:12,400 --> 02:48:14,400
news

3136
02:48:14,400 --> 02:48:16,400
but when we're talking about

3137
02:48:16,400 --> 02:48:18,400
a $350 console that it's happening

3138
02:48:18,400 --> 02:48:20,400
with it does sting a hell of a

3139
02:48:20,400 --> 02:48:22,400
lot more than some $40

3140
02:48:22,400 --> 02:48:24,400
game exactly

3141
02:48:24,400 --> 02:48:26,400
stop shopping at GameStop I'm sorry

3142
02:48:26,400 --> 02:48:28,400
it had to be said you know well

3143
02:48:28,400 --> 02:48:30,400
absolutely correct this is why I shop at

3144
02:48:30,400 --> 02:48:32,400
Best Buy they give you at least two weeks to pick up

3145
02:48:32,400 --> 02:48:34,400
your stuff or

3146
02:48:34,400 --> 02:48:36,400
shit Walmart had that whole layaway

3147
02:48:36,400 --> 02:48:38,400
thing where you'd have till Christmas day to come

3148
02:48:38,400 --> 02:48:40,400
get it so you know

3149
02:48:40,400 --> 02:48:42,400
you got to look at the other options

3150
02:48:42,400 --> 02:48:44,400
exactly or targets where

3151
02:48:44,400 --> 02:48:46,400
I lucked out today did I talk

3152
02:48:46,400 --> 02:48:48,400
about that during the top of the show I used the target

3153
02:48:48,400 --> 02:48:50,400
app on iPhone to see because you can

3154
02:48:50,400 --> 02:48:52,400
check inventories and I saw that there was

3155
02:48:52,400 --> 02:48:54,400
one not my closest target

3156
02:48:54,400 --> 02:48:56,400
but the second closest one had had him in stock

3157
02:48:56,400 --> 02:48:58,400
now

3158
02:48:58,400 --> 02:49:00,400
I was discussing more

3159
02:49:00,400 --> 02:49:02,400
and that's because the argument with another person that

3160
02:49:02,400 --> 02:49:04,400
works at GameStop I said look

3161
02:49:04,400 --> 02:49:06,400
if I paid for my

3162
02:49:06,400 --> 02:49:08,400
Wii U in full

3163
02:49:08,400 --> 02:49:10,400
and when I get there

3164
02:49:10,400 --> 02:49:12,400
it's not there

3165
02:49:12,400 --> 02:49:14,400
that's theft

3166
02:49:14,400 --> 02:49:16,400
me personally at that point I

3167
02:49:16,400 --> 02:49:18,400
would want a full refund of what I paid

3168
02:49:18,400 --> 02:49:20,400
and I'm going somewhere else to pick up my console

3169
02:49:20,400 --> 02:49:22,400
now this other person is arguing

3170
02:49:22,400 --> 02:49:24,400
it's not theft because you're still going to get it

3171
02:49:24,400 --> 02:49:26,400
I'm like yes it is since you

3172
02:49:26,400 --> 02:49:28,400
pretty much guaranteed me

3173
02:49:28,400 --> 02:49:30,400
that last one belongs to me

3174
02:49:30,400 --> 02:49:32,400
and not nobody else

3175
02:49:32,400 --> 02:49:34,400
I think that's

3176
02:49:34,400 --> 02:49:36,400
rough

3177
02:49:36,400 --> 02:49:38,400
I can't make

3178
02:49:38,400 --> 02:49:40,400
a fairness claim because it's not

3179
02:49:40,400 --> 02:49:42,400
fair to anyone

3180
02:49:42,400 --> 02:49:44,400
it's nice that they will be willing to give

3181
02:49:44,400 --> 02:49:46,400
it up eventually

3182
02:49:46,400 --> 02:49:48,400
that they have

3183
02:49:48,400 --> 02:49:50,400
a window

3184
02:49:50,400 --> 02:49:52,400
I'm talking primarily Wii U right now

3185
02:49:52,400 --> 02:49:54,400
you said 48 hours

3186
02:49:54,400 --> 02:49:56,400
but it doesn't really cover what you were talking about

3187
02:49:56,400 --> 02:49:58,400
with Assassin's Creed 3

3188
02:49:58,400 --> 02:50:00,400
what I mean to say was because of

3189
02:50:00,400 --> 02:50:02,400
what happened with Assassin's Creed 3

3190
02:50:02,400 --> 02:50:04,400
people who pre-ordered didn't

3191
02:50:04,400 --> 02:50:06,400
get it because they went to other people

3192
02:50:06,400 --> 02:50:08,400
so an email came from corporate from that

3193
02:50:08,400 --> 02:50:10,400
no person left behind

3194
02:50:10,400 --> 02:50:12,400
doesn't matter about the 40 hour rule

3195
02:50:12,400 --> 02:50:14,400
it's no longer in effect

3196
02:50:14,400 --> 02:50:16,400
even though there's still some stores that are still doing it

3197
02:50:16,400 --> 02:50:18,400
let me go to a comment in our chat room

3198
02:50:18,400 --> 02:50:20,400
at live.vognetwork.com

3199
02:50:20,400 --> 02:50:22,400
Dungeon Buster says that 48 hours thing

3200
02:50:22,400 --> 02:50:24,400
has been with GameStop forever

3201
02:50:24,400 --> 02:50:26,400
particularly with products in demand

3202
02:50:26,400 --> 02:50:28,400
they'll promise the moon for pre-orders

3203
02:50:28,400 --> 02:50:30,400
but the inside policy is to move inventory

3204
02:50:30,400 --> 02:50:32,400
yeah that's exactly what it is

3205
02:50:32,400 --> 02:50:34,400
I get that from a business perspective

3206
02:50:34,400 --> 02:50:36,400
like I totally get that from a business

3207
02:50:36,400 --> 02:50:38,400
perspective but here's the question

3208
02:50:38,400 --> 02:50:40,400
that a lot of companies don't always

3209
02:50:40,400 --> 02:50:42,400
assess properly

3210
02:50:42,400 --> 02:50:44,400
at what customer service sacrifice

3211
02:50:44,400 --> 02:50:46,400
are you gonna

3212
02:50:46,400 --> 02:50:48,400
imply that

3213
02:50:48,400 --> 02:50:50,400
business perspective it's about finding balance

3214
02:50:50,400 --> 02:50:52,400
and GameStop's opinion

3215
02:50:52,400 --> 02:50:54,400
obviously at the price of 50

3216
02:50:54,400 --> 02:50:56,400
60 dollars GameStop can lose a few

3217
02:50:56,400 --> 02:50:58,400
customers and still make a profit at the same time

3218
02:50:58,400 --> 02:51:00,400
though they did just close 20 stores

3219
02:51:00,400 --> 02:51:02,400
so maybe they're not in the

3220
02:51:02,400 --> 02:51:04,400
best position to be turning people away but I

3221
02:51:04,400 --> 02:51:06,400
don't know at the same time

3222
02:51:06,400 --> 02:51:08,400
they pissed your brother off potentially

3223
02:51:08,400 --> 02:51:10,400
but they would have made someone else very happy

3224
02:51:10,400 --> 02:51:12,400
true so

3225
02:51:12,400 --> 02:51:14,400
I'm not again I'm not saying it's right I'm just

3226
02:51:14,400 --> 02:51:16,400
trying to weigh the different

3227
02:51:16,400 --> 02:51:18,400
sides of it and look at the business perspective

3228
02:51:18,400 --> 02:51:20,400
alright and you're right cause

3229
02:51:20,400 --> 02:51:22,400
I worked retail for like 15 plus years

3230
02:51:22,400 --> 02:51:24,400
I mean I see the business side

3231
02:51:24,400 --> 02:51:26,400
of it I also see the customer

3232
02:51:26,400 --> 02:51:28,400
side of things if it was me personally

3233
02:51:28,400 --> 02:51:30,400
if I knew the person and

3234
02:51:30,400 --> 02:51:32,400
I would do my best to hold

3235
02:51:32,400 --> 02:51:34,400
it for them but if my manager's telling me

3236
02:51:34,400 --> 02:51:36,400
give it to the next person I'm giving it to

3237
02:51:36,400 --> 02:51:38,400
the next person cause between you and me my

3238
02:51:38,400 --> 02:51:40,400
job's a little more important than what that person on the other side

3239
02:51:40,400 --> 02:51:42,400
of the counter wants

3240
02:51:42,400 --> 02:51:44,400
here's my thing personally this is how I would

3241
02:51:44,400 --> 02:51:46,400
do it this is how I would do it is that

3242
02:51:46,400 --> 02:51:48,400
and I'm not GameStop but if I

3243
02:51:48,400 --> 02:51:50,400
I think the balance would be if that customer

3244
02:51:50,400 --> 02:51:52,400
calls within the first 48

3245
02:51:52,400 --> 02:51:54,400
hours and says hey

3246
02:51:54,400 --> 02:51:56,400
I want to come get my system but I

3247
02:51:56,400 --> 02:51:58,400
can't can I have an extension and

3248
02:51:58,400 --> 02:52:00,400
tell such and such reasonable time

3249
02:52:00,400 --> 02:52:02,400
reasonable being within you know

3250
02:52:02,400 --> 02:52:04,400
another 48 hours or whatever then

3251
02:52:04,400 --> 02:52:06,400
grant them the stinking extension

3252
02:52:06,400 --> 02:52:08,400
but if a person no call no shows

3253
02:52:08,400 --> 02:52:10,400
then give their shit away

3254
02:52:10,400 --> 02:52:12,400
I think that's a fair compromise

3255
02:52:12,400 --> 02:52:14,400
it is it is

3256
02:52:14,400 --> 02:52:16,400
but as you can see GameStop's all about

3257
02:52:16,400 --> 02:52:18,400
making that I mean

3258
02:52:18,400 --> 02:52:20,400
ShameStop's all about making that

3259
02:52:20,400 --> 02:52:22,400
green dollar buck

3260
02:52:22,400 --> 02:52:24,400
I don't know what I'm just some schmo with a podcast

3261
02:52:24,400 --> 02:52:26,400
I don't know what I'm talking about

3262
02:52:26,400 --> 02:52:28,400

3263
02:52:28,400 --> 02:52:30,400

02:52:50,400 --> 02:52:52,400

3274
02:52:52,400 --> 02:52:54,400

3278
02:53:00,400 --> 02:53:02,400
any other last minute stories or should I get some tweets

3279
02:53:04,400 --> 02:53:06,400
just kind of some random stuff Tom Hardy's

3280
02:53:06,400 --> 02:53:08,400
gonna be in the Splinter Cell movie

3281
02:53:08,400 --> 02:53:10,400
she mentioned that during Rapid Fire

3282
02:53:10,400 --> 02:53:12,400
oh I wasn't listening I just thought I'd mention again

3283
02:53:12,400 --> 02:53:14,400
Tom Hardy's awesome although I haven't yet

3284
02:53:14,400 --> 02:53:16,400
to see the last Batman movie

3285
02:53:16,400 --> 02:53:18,400
so me too I really mean to

3286
02:53:18,400 --> 02:53:20,400
or Avengers

3287
02:53:20,400 --> 02:53:22,400
the last I think I said this on the show already

3288
02:53:22,400 --> 02:53:24,400
the last Batman movie was great but Tom Hardy's

3289
02:53:24,400 --> 02:53:26,400
Bane it really creeped me out how he sounded like

3290
02:53:26,400 --> 02:53:28,400
Count Von Count or I think this

3291
02:53:28,400 --> 02:53:30,400
was mentioned I'm going to destroy Gotham City

3292
02:53:30,400 --> 02:53:32,400
yeah I think this was mentioned last week

3293
02:53:32,400 --> 02:53:34,400
he sounded Belgian to me

3294
02:53:34,400 --> 02:53:36,400
it was Alan if you've seen that

3295
02:53:36,400 --> 02:53:38,400
YouTube video series now they have

3296
02:53:38,400 --> 02:53:40,400
Tom Hardy reading the cans of

3297
02:53:40,400 --> 02:53:42,400
energy drink

3298
02:53:42,400 --> 02:53:44,400
no I haven't seen that you need to find

3299
02:53:44,400 --> 02:53:46,400
that it's hilarious Tom Hardy

3300
02:53:46,400 --> 02:53:48,400
is hot as hell well it's not Tom Hardy it's

3301
02:53:48,400 --> 02:53:50,400
Bane it's Tom Hardy's Bane reading the

3302
02:53:50,400 --> 02:53:52,400
one fish

3303
02:53:52,400 --> 02:53:54,400

3305
02:53:56,400 --> 02:53:58,400
hi you are on OrangeLoungeRadio who's this

3306
02:54:00,400 --> 02:54:02,400
it's Amiga777

3307
02:54:02,400 --> 02:54:04,400
I'm sorry say that again you are a little

3308
02:54:04,400 --> 02:54:06,400
bit quiet

3309
02:54:06,400 --> 02:54:08,400
Amiga777

3310
02:54:08,400 --> 02:54:10,400
Amiga777 now I can hear you buddy

3311
02:54:10,400 --> 02:54:12,400
what's on your mind

3312
02:54:12,400 --> 02:54:14,400
basically

3313
02:54:14,400 --> 02:54:16,400
the Wii U

3314
02:54:16,400 --> 02:54:18,400
launch yes

3315
02:54:18,400 --> 02:54:20,400
I was

3316
02:54:20,400 --> 02:54:22,400
at last night I was out you know

3317
02:54:22,400 --> 02:54:24,400
just driving around saying

3318
02:54:24,400 --> 02:54:26,400
if there was anyone you know who might

3319
02:54:26,400 --> 02:54:28,400
have been camping you

3320
02:54:28,400 --> 02:54:30,400
know you know out in

3321
02:54:30,400 --> 02:54:32,400
anticipation or pre-orders

3322
02:54:32,400 --> 02:54:34,400
anything like that and

3323
02:54:34,400 --> 02:54:36,400
I couldn't find

3324
02:54:36,400 --> 02:54:38,400
really anybody it's like if they

3325
02:54:38,400 --> 02:54:40,400
were out there

3326
02:54:40,400 --> 02:54:42,400
they're probably just

3327
02:54:42,400 --> 02:54:44,400
parked in the cars instead of you know

3328
02:54:44,400 --> 02:54:46,400
out in the tents or

3329
02:54:46,400 --> 02:54:48,400
whatever you know I think a lot

3330
02:54:48,400 --> 02:54:50,400
more stores did pre-orders this

3331
02:54:50,400 --> 02:54:52,400
time which was very different from last time

3332
02:54:52,400 --> 02:54:54,400
in 2006

3333
02:54:54,400 --> 02:54:56,400
I remember because we drove around and

3334
02:54:56,400 --> 02:54:58,400
looked at all the lines and we participated

3335
02:54:58,400 --> 02:55:00,400
in a line at Target and there was

3336
02:55:00,400 --> 02:55:02,400
a line at Walmart there was a line at

3337
02:55:02,400 --> 02:55:04,400
Best Buy there was a line at Toys

3338
02:55:04,400 --> 02:55:06,400
Us there was a line at Circuit City

3339
02:55:06,400 --> 02:55:08,400
well we all know why there wasn't a line

3340
02:55:08,400 --> 02:55:10,400
there this year but

3341
02:55:10,400 --> 02:55:12,400
some of these other stores I named all with the

3342
02:55:12,400 --> 02:55:14,400
exception of Target they all did pre-orders

3343
02:55:14,400 --> 02:55:16,400
they didn't do them six years ago

3344
02:55:16,400 --> 02:55:18,400
but they do them now Best Buy did pre-orders

3345
02:55:18,400 --> 02:55:20,400
Walmart did pre-orders

3346
02:55:20,400 --> 02:55:22,400
Target did not do pre-orders

3347
02:55:22,400 --> 02:55:24,400
so if you were going to find a line that was probably the

3348
02:55:24,400 --> 02:55:26,400
place to be but I think

3349
02:55:26,400 --> 02:55:28,400
most people that were really

3350
02:55:28,400 --> 02:55:30,400
that rabbit about it probably got their

3351
02:55:30,400 --> 02:55:32,400
pre-order but I sure

3352
02:55:32,400 --> 02:55:34,400
did see some interesting tweets

3353
02:55:34,400 --> 02:55:36,400
and I you know again it's Twitter so take it with a

3354
02:55:36,400 --> 02:55:38,400
grain of salt but I saw somebody on Twitter

3355
02:55:38,400 --> 02:55:40,400
who said there was a line at Walmart

3356
02:55:40,400 --> 02:55:42,400
and the third person in line

3357
02:55:42,400 --> 02:55:44,400
bought all the remaining

3358
02:55:44,400 --> 02:55:46,400
we use and pissed everybody else

3359
02:55:46,400 --> 02:55:48,400
off in line because you know she was going to flip

3360
02:55:48,400 --> 02:55:50,400
them on eBay and actually

3361
02:55:50,400 --> 02:55:52,400
the clerk I had at Target

3362
02:55:52,400 --> 02:55:54,400
today said somebody tried to come in and do

3363
02:55:54,400 --> 02:55:56,400
the same thing and they said no because

3364
02:55:56,400 --> 02:55:58,400
they had a policy on these items to sell

3365
02:55:58,400 --> 02:56:00,400
only one and I said good because

3366
02:56:00,400 --> 02:56:02,400
you know those are just going to end up on eBay and he's like

3367
02:56:02,400 --> 02:56:04,400
yeah I can't he's like I don't

3368
02:56:04,400 --> 02:56:06,400
those they need to do something about those eBay flippers

3369
02:56:06,400 --> 02:56:08,400
I'm like hell yeah they do so

3370
02:56:08,400 --> 02:56:10,400
anyway sorry I got a little tangenty

3371
02:56:10,400 --> 02:56:12,400
but so you didn't find any lines

3372
02:56:12,400 --> 02:56:14,400
yeah

3373
02:56:14,400 --> 02:56:16,400
yeah I mean I was looking for

3374
02:56:16,400 --> 02:56:18,400
campers you know late at night you know just

3375
02:56:18,400 --> 02:56:20,400
waiting it's like

3376
02:56:20,400 --> 02:56:22,400
like where is everybody they all

3377
02:56:22,400 --> 02:56:24,400
went to New York City I thought this was

3378
02:56:24,400 --> 02:56:26,400
a big deal

3379
02:56:26,400 --> 02:56:28,400
and

3380
02:56:28,400 --> 02:56:30,400
I'm getting a text message correcting

3381
02:56:30,400 --> 02:56:32,400
me from somebody listening right now

3382
02:56:32,400 --> 02:56:34,400
but they did do pre-orders

3383
02:56:34,400 --> 02:56:36,400
at Target okay

3384
02:56:36,400 --> 02:56:38,400
well shit they didn't do enough then

3385
02:56:38,400 --> 02:56:40,400
I didn't realize they did apparently not to sell

3386
02:56:40,400 --> 02:56:42,400
out their first run stock yeah that's that's

3387
02:56:42,400 --> 02:56:44,400
weird they must have done them real late in the game because

3388
02:56:44,400 --> 02:56:46,400
I didn't see anything on the website or nothing but alright

3389
02:56:46,400 --> 02:56:48,400
I'll take his word for

3390
02:56:48,400 --> 02:56:50,400
it maybe

3391
02:56:50,400 --> 02:56:52,400
they didn't all do it too could have been certain

3392
02:56:52,400 --> 02:56:54,400
ones but anyway

3393
02:56:54,400 --> 02:56:56,400
maybe the time to have seen the line

3394
02:56:56,400 --> 02:56:58,400
would have been earlier today I don't know

3395
02:56:58,400 --> 02:57:00,400
but yeah it's kind of a bummer

3396
02:57:00,400 --> 02:57:02,400
the line thing didn't happen because there was a lot

3397
02:57:02,400 --> 02:57:04,400
of community that came with it like

3398
02:57:04,400 --> 02:57:06,400
Jamie I know you had a real fun time you know

3399
02:57:06,400 --> 02:57:08,400
well I don't know about like real fun but you had a

3400
02:57:08,400 --> 02:57:10,400
well enough time in the line

3401
02:57:10,400 --> 02:57:12,400
just kind of talking to people right yeah but it

3402
02:57:12,400 --> 02:57:14,400
did get kind of boring yeah

3403
02:57:14,400 --> 02:57:16,400
and then it got really sleepy at four

3404
02:57:16,400 --> 02:57:18,400
in the morning it starts to get old

3405
02:57:18,400 --> 02:57:20,400
oh and then there was the woman who showed up like after all of

3406
02:57:20,400 --> 02:57:22,400

3407
02:57:22,400 --> 02:57:24,400

3416
02:57:40,400 --> 02:57:42,400

3417
02:57:42,400 --> 02:57:44,400

02:57:44,400 --> 02:57:46,400
really curious you know just

3420
02:57:48,400 --> 02:57:50,400
from Nintendo and

3421
02:57:50,400 --> 02:57:52,400
I was just hearing a lot about it

3422
02:57:52,400 --> 02:57:54,400
currently

3423
02:57:54,400 --> 02:57:56,400

taking with all the

3428
02:58:04,400 --> 02:58:06,400
hype behind it you know

3429
02:58:06,400 --> 02:58:08,400
and Reggie sees me being on

3430
02:58:08,400 --> 02:58:10,400
Late Night with Jimmy Fallon

3431
02:58:10,400 --> 02:58:12,400
a couple nights ago

3432
02:58:12,400 --> 02:58:14,400
I thought

3433
02:58:14,400 --> 02:58:16,400
I was gonna be seeing a lot of

3434
02:58:16,400 --> 02:58:18,400
avid fans

3435
02:58:18,400 --> 02:58:20,400
of Nintendo

3436
02:58:20,400 --> 02:58:22,400
I guess instead

3437
02:58:22,400 --> 02:58:24,400
I think I

3438
02:58:24,400 --> 02:58:26,400
saw it as Nintendo just

3439
02:58:26,400 --> 02:58:28,400
probably just planning

3440
02:58:28,400 --> 02:58:30,400
a light launch or something

3441
02:58:30,400 --> 02:58:32,400
like that then

3442
02:58:32,400 --> 02:58:34,400
and I think me and maybe others

3443
02:58:34,400 --> 02:58:36,400
might have anticipated

3444
02:58:36,400 --> 02:58:38,400
maybe it's something that will really

3445
02:58:38,400 --> 02:58:40,400
start to gear up through 2013

3446
02:58:40,400 --> 02:58:42,400
oh yeah you do talk about the light launch

3447
02:58:42,400 --> 02:58:44,400
and we don't we didn't see a lot of commercials

3448
02:58:44,400 --> 02:58:46,400
this year either I mean there was

3449
02:58:46,400 --> 02:58:48,400
like the occasional movie screen commercial that

3450
02:58:48,400 --> 02:58:50,400
I caught but like there's not really

3451
02:58:50,400 --> 02:58:52,400
been the TV commercials or that whole like

3452
02:58:52,400 --> 02:58:54,400
what they did last time with the we

3453
02:58:54,400 --> 02:58:56,400
would like to play I think

3454
02:58:56,400 --> 02:58:58,400
and I heard this theory on Bobby's show

3455
02:58:58,400 --> 02:59:00,400
and it seems

3456
02:59:00,400 --> 02:59:02,400
perfectly reasonable to me they're just

3457
02:59:02,400 --> 02:59:04,400
saving all that money to market them next year

3458
02:59:04,400 --> 02:59:06,400
after Christmas makes sense to me

3459
02:59:06,400 --> 02:59:08,400
or after Thanksgiving

3460
02:59:08,400 --> 02:59:10,400
the bigger holiday rush either or

3461
02:59:10,400 --> 02:59:12,400
but just why blow all the money

3462
02:59:12,400 --> 02:59:14,400
now when all your pre-orders sold out

3463
02:59:14,400 --> 02:59:16,400
who do you have to advertise to let the word

3464
02:59:16,400 --> 02:59:18,400
of mouth do its thing

3465
02:59:18,400 --> 02:59:20,400
very very true

3466
02:59:20,400 --> 02:59:22,400
very true alright Amiga77

3467
02:59:22,400 --> 02:59:24,400
I hope you're able to get one if you want one

3468
02:59:24,400 --> 02:59:26,400
hopefully maybe a luck will

3469
02:59:26,400 --> 02:59:28,400
turn around around the holidays but thanks

3470
02:59:28,400 --> 02:59:30,400
so much for calling the show alright

3471
02:59:30,400 --> 02:59:32,400
alright alright take care buddy

3472
02:59:32,400 --> 02:59:34,400
yep bye bye

3473
02:59:34,400 --> 02:59:36,400
thanks to

3474
02:59:36,400 --> 02:59:38,400
the call I haven't heard from him in a long time

3475
02:59:38,400 --> 02:59:40,400
appreciate hearing from some

3476
02:59:40,400 --> 02:59:42,400
callers we don't hear from all the time

3477
02:59:42,400 --> 02:59:44,400
Tigerclaw in chat says I haven't seen

3478
02:59:44,400 --> 02:59:46,400
any Wii U commercials I only see a lot of

3479
02:59:46,400 --> 02:59:48,400
commercials for that Red Dawn remake

3480
02:59:48,400 --> 02:59:50,400
which apparently according to the

3481
02:59:50,400 --> 02:59:52,400
commercial always got a lot of good reviews

3482
02:59:52,400 --> 02:59:54,400
ok here's the thing

3483
02:59:54,400 --> 02:59:56,400
there are so many movie critics

3484
02:59:56,400 --> 02:59:58,400
that'll say good things about any

3485
02:59:58,400 --> 03:00:00,400
fucking movie just to be in the commercial

3486
03:00:00,400 --> 03:00:02,400
and gain their own cred believe it

3487
03:00:02,400 --> 03:00:04,400
for the record

3488
03:00:04,400 --> 03:00:06,400
I'm sorry Red Dawn

3489
03:00:06,400 --> 03:00:08,400
was a movie in the 80's it was

3490
03:00:08,400 --> 03:00:10,400
that's the only thing I have to say about that

3491
03:00:10,400 --> 03:00:12,400
and they're remaking it because you know it's so

3492
03:00:12,400 --> 03:00:14,400
topical I kind of want to see the sequel

3493
03:00:14,400 --> 03:00:16,400
or the second one or the remake or whatever

3494
03:00:16,400 --> 03:00:18,400
I kind of want to see it

3495
03:00:18,400 --> 03:00:20,400
because it looks kind of cool

3496
03:00:20,400 --> 03:00:22,400
I just want the scene where the girl's dead

3497
03:00:22,400 --> 03:00:24,400
and she has the grenade on her and they find her and they

3498
03:00:24,400 --> 03:00:26,400
blow up I'm not like you know

3499
03:00:26,400 --> 03:00:28,400
I don't think it's going to be better than the original

3500
03:00:28,400 --> 03:00:30,400
or anything like that it's just going to be it's just a movie

3501
03:00:30,400 --> 03:00:32,400
whatever it's just a dumb popcorn

3502
03:00:32,400 --> 03:00:34,400
flick exactly it is a dumb

3503
03:00:34,400 --> 03:00:36,400
popcorn flick and

3504
03:00:36,400 --> 03:00:38,400
there's been a lot of dumb popcorn flicks that

3505
03:00:38,400 --> 03:00:40,400
have come out like you know dread

3506
03:00:40,400 --> 03:00:42,400
ended up being really good so

3507
03:00:42,400 --> 03:00:44,400
Dread was amazingly

3508
03:00:44,400 --> 03:00:46,400
good oh man that's it's funny

3509
03:00:46,400 --> 03:00:48,400
to say that's the last movie that I saw

3510
03:00:48,400 --> 03:00:50,400
I've missed Avengers I've missed

3511
03:00:50,400 --> 03:00:52,400
Prometheus I've missed I haven't seen

3512
03:00:52,400 --> 03:00:54,400
Wreck-It Ralph yet I want to see Skyfall I want to see

3513
03:00:54,400 --> 03:00:56,400
all of those for some reason I just don't see

3514
03:00:56,400 --> 03:00:58,400
movies enough but I was out when I was

3515
03:00:58,400 --> 03:01:00,400
out in New Mexico I saw Dread with some friends of mine

3516
03:01:00,400 --> 03:01:02,400
oh man knew nothing about it

3517
03:01:02,400 --> 03:01:04,400
going in other than Judge Dread and

3518
03:01:04,400 --> 03:01:06,400
completely worth it I used to have the pinball table

3519
03:01:06,400 --> 03:01:08,400
I don't know if I played

3520
03:01:08,400 --> 03:01:10,400
that one alright okay if anybody

3521
03:01:10,400 --> 03:01:12,400
else wants to call I can squeeze in one other quick

3522
03:01:12,400 --> 03:01:14,400
call 1877 game OLR or

3523
03:01:14,400 --> 03:01:16,400
username on Skype orange launch radio

3524
03:01:16,400 --> 03:01:18,400
any other last minute stories I still have some Twitter topics

3525
03:01:18,400 --> 03:01:20,400
to do but yeah

3526
03:01:20,400 --> 03:01:22,400
as we kind of mentioned a little bit

3527
03:01:22,400 --> 03:01:24,400
your Nintendo network account

3528
03:01:24,400 --> 03:01:26,400
is tied to your Wii U so if it

3529
03:01:26,400 --> 03:01:28,400
breaks I guess you've

3530
03:01:28,400 --> 03:01:30,400
ever sent it to Nintendo because I'm sure they can

3531
03:01:30,400 --> 03:01:32,400
transfer it to a new system but

3532
03:01:32,400 --> 03:01:34,400
if you try to go buy a new system

3533
03:01:34,400 --> 03:01:36,400
you're fucked so

3534
03:01:36,400 --> 03:01:38,400
just saying I'm giving

3535
03:01:38,400 --> 03:01:40,400
Nintendo the benefit of the doubt here that they

3536
03:01:40,400 --> 03:01:42,400
just haven't implemented that yet I hope

3537
03:01:42,400 --> 03:01:44,400
I hope I'm thinking that it's something

3538
03:01:44,400 --> 03:01:46,400
that a consumer can't

3539
03:01:46,400 --> 03:01:48,400
just go buy a new system that they have

3540
03:01:48,400 --> 03:01:50,400
to send it in Nintendo for a repair and

3541
03:01:50,400 --> 03:01:52,400
then they can do the transfer because that's how

3542
03:01:52,400 --> 03:01:54,400
it was with the Wii how do you get all your Wii

3543
03:01:54,400 --> 03:01:56,400
or Wii virtual console

3544
03:01:56,400 --> 03:01:58,400
crap transferred over that they would have to

3545
03:01:58,400 --> 03:02:00,400
do it and then of course somebody

3546
03:02:00,400 --> 03:02:02,400
accidentally found a way to get into the

3547
03:02:02,400 --> 03:02:04,400
dev stuff for

3548
03:02:04,400 --> 03:02:06,400
or the debug menu for the Wii U

3549
03:02:06,400 --> 03:02:08,400
thing and then there

3550
03:02:08,400 --> 03:02:10,400
was another one that someone put that somehow

3551
03:02:10,400 --> 03:02:12,400
they got into the debug thing

3552
03:02:12,400 --> 03:02:14,400
for the Wii U Miiverse but I think that's

3553
03:02:14,400 --> 03:02:16,400
photoshopped so

3554
03:02:16,400 --> 03:02:18,400
not going to say anything about that

3555
03:02:18,400 --> 03:02:20,400
but yeah the debug menu though on the

3556
03:02:20,400 --> 03:02:22,400
actual system I can believe that

3557
03:02:22,400 --> 03:02:24,400
alright let me do some

3558
03:02:24,400 --> 03:02:26,400
Twitter topics real quick Tigerclaw sent

3559
03:02:26,400 --> 03:02:28,400
in a few he also sent in the 50 cents

3560
03:02:28,400 --> 03:02:30,400
miners thing and the one you

3561
03:02:30,400 --> 03:02:32,400
just talked about

3562
03:02:32,400 --> 03:02:34,400
so I want to tip the hat to Tigerclaw

3563
03:02:34,400 --> 03:02:36,400
because he did send one other that neither

3564
03:02:36,400 --> 03:02:38,400
of us have hit on yet

3565
03:02:38,400 --> 03:02:40,400
video game industry companies getting

3566
03:02:40,400 --> 03:02:42,400
recognition in other areas

3567
03:02:42,400 --> 03:02:44,400
the human rights campaign

3568
03:02:44,400 --> 03:02:46,400
which champions a lot of LGBT

3569
03:02:46,400 --> 03:02:48,400
causes which you know

3570
03:02:48,400 --> 03:02:50,400
obviously huge huge month for

3571
03:02:50,400 --> 03:02:52,400
them with the elections

3572
03:02:52,400 --> 03:02:54,400
Microsoft and EA were recognized

3573
03:02:54,400 --> 03:02:56,400
as best places to work

3574
03:02:56,400 --> 03:02:58,400
for LGBT equality

3575
03:02:58,400 --> 03:03:00,400
and I love that the picture

3576
03:03:00,400 --> 03:03:02,400
on this article is

3577
03:03:02,400 --> 03:03:04,400
Kaiden and ManShepherd

3578
03:03:04,400 --> 03:03:06,400
from Mass Effect 3 which is a great example

3579
03:03:06,400 --> 03:03:08,400
from EA's universe

3580
03:03:08,400 --> 03:03:10,400
I'm telling you I don't

3581
03:03:10,400 --> 03:03:12,400
care how it makes me sound that's

3582
03:03:12,400 --> 03:03:14,400
the reason I played Mass Effect I was like

3583
03:03:14,400 --> 03:03:16,400
alright I do need to play Mass Effect I got to

3584
03:03:16,400 --> 03:03:18,400
see what this is all about

3585
03:03:18,400 --> 03:03:20,400
I was not disappointed but there's something

3586
03:03:20,400 --> 03:03:22,400
in it for everybody

3587
03:03:22,400 --> 03:03:24,400
and I know Microsoft

3588
03:03:24,400 --> 03:03:26,400
has always got kudos to this I saw

3589
03:03:26,400 --> 03:03:28,400
there was like an official Microsoft gamer

3590
03:03:28,400 --> 03:03:30,400
con video that they did and you know

3591
03:03:30,400 --> 03:03:32,400
I know they've always been pretty good too with this

3592
03:03:32,400 --> 03:03:34,400
stuff so good for them

3593
03:03:34,400 --> 03:03:36,400
the 2013 corporate equality

3594
03:03:36,400 --> 03:03:38,400
index is the national benchmarking tool

3595
03:03:38,400 --> 03:03:40,400
on corporate policies this is according

3596
03:03:40,400 --> 03:03:42,400
to the official website and

3597
03:03:42,400 --> 03:03:44,400
EA's chief talent officer

3598
03:03:44,400 --> 03:03:46,400
Gabriel Toledano

3599
03:03:46,400 --> 03:03:48,400
I am very pleased that EA has scored

3600
03:03:48,400 --> 03:03:50,400
100% rating and has been recognized by the

3601
03:03:50,400 --> 03:03:52,400
human rights campaign in a year where the

3602
03:03:52,400 --> 03:03:54,400
company has taken significant steps to remain

3603
03:03:54,400 --> 03:03:56,400
inclusive EA has made changes

3604
03:03:56,400 --> 03:03:58,400
to our medical benefits been involved

3605
03:03:58,400 --> 03:04:00,400
in LGBT events in our community and

3606
03:04:00,400 --> 03:04:02,400
taken a public stance against the Defense of Marriage

3607
03:04:02,400 --> 03:04:04,400
Act EA champions diversity

3608
03:04:04,400 --> 03:04:06,400
with a work environment where everyone feels welcome

3609
03:04:06,400 --> 03:04:08,400
and can be themselves

3610
03:04:08,400 --> 03:04:10,400
you know I sometimes forget

3611
03:04:10,400 --> 03:04:12,400
that like I have Alan on my

3612
03:04:12,400 --> 03:04:14,400
medical insurance because you know we've been together

3613
03:04:14,400 --> 03:04:16,400
long enough that it's basically whether we're

3614
03:04:16,400 --> 03:04:18,400
legally recognized or not it's like a

3615
03:04:18,400 --> 03:04:20,400
common law partnership at this thing I can

3616
03:04:20,400 --> 03:04:22,400
put him on my benefits no problem because you

3617
03:04:22,400 --> 03:04:24,400
know I'm in California and I work for a health insurance

3618
03:04:24,400 --> 03:04:26,400
company that recognizes that stuff I sometimes

3619
03:04:26,400 --> 03:04:28,400
forget like not everybody's that lucky

3620
03:04:28,400 --> 03:04:30,400
he just blows my

3621
03:04:30,400 --> 03:04:32,400
mind

3622
03:04:32,400 --> 03:04:34,400
I had one more last minute story please

3623
03:04:34,400 --> 03:04:36,400
it's kind of cool it's a black ops 2

3624
03:04:36,400 --> 03:04:38,400
easter egg in the nuketown

3625
03:04:38,400 --> 03:04:40,400
2025 map if you shoot

3626
03:04:40,400 --> 03:04:42,400
off all the mannequins heads on that

3627
03:04:42,400 --> 03:04:44,400
map in under 60 seconds

3628
03:04:44,400 --> 03:04:46,400
it unlocks an atari 2600

3629
03:04:46,400 --> 03:04:48,400
on the TV

3630
03:04:48,400 --> 03:04:50,400
in the game the nuketown TV the big old

3631
03:04:50,400 --> 03:04:52,400
screen TV and you can play Activision

3632
03:04:52,400 --> 03:04:54,400
games including hero

3633
03:04:54,400 --> 03:04:56,400
Pitfall and

3634
03:04:56,400 --> 03:04:58,400
Kaboom

3635
03:04:58,400 --> 03:05:00,400
were some of the ones I did see

3636
03:05:00,400 --> 03:05:02,400
screenshots for nice

3637
03:05:02,400 --> 03:05:04,400
or a video

3638
03:05:04,400 --> 03:05:06,400
couple questions and comments on Twitter

3639
03:05:06,400 --> 03:05:08,400
from Oscar on Twitter

3640
03:05:08,400 --> 03:05:10,400
not sold on the Wii U

3641
03:05:10,400 --> 03:05:12,400
wait until some relevant games come out

3642
03:05:12,400 --> 03:05:14,400
I think you're in Camp Loki over there

3643
03:05:14,400 --> 03:05:16,400
I think Loki will be swayed if the right games

3644
03:05:16,400 --> 03:05:18,400
come out but we ain't there yet

3645
03:05:18,400 --> 03:05:20,400
Bayonetta 2

3646
03:05:20,400 --> 03:05:22,400
no ways off

3647
03:05:22,400 --> 03:05:24,400
still but I bet

3648
03:05:24,400 --> 03:05:26,400
there's gonna be that Zelda or that

3649
03:05:26,400 --> 03:05:28,400
you know big game is gonna be a must

3650
03:05:28,400 --> 03:05:30,400
have next year we'll see we'll see

3651
03:05:30,400 --> 03:05:32,400
I'm not disappointed

3652
03:05:32,400 --> 03:05:34,400
uh Spazinator

3653
03:05:34,400 --> 03:05:36,400
PSN tweets us

3654
03:05:36,400 --> 03:05:38,400
random question if you three

3655
03:05:38,400 --> 03:05:40,400
could only pick one to play

3656
03:05:40,400 --> 03:05:42,400
which would you pick I'm

3657
03:05:42,400 --> 03:05:44,400
gonna say you four cause he didn't know maybe

3658
03:05:44,400 --> 03:05:46,400
that Jason was gonna be here tonight which would you pick

3659
03:05:46,400 --> 03:05:48,400
PC gaming

3660
03:05:48,400 --> 03:05:50,400
or console and

3661
03:05:50,400 --> 03:05:52,400
why so you only get one

3662
03:05:52,400 --> 03:05:54,400
or the other ever again

3663
03:05:54,400 --> 03:05:56,400
PC gaming or console and why

3664
03:05:56,400 --> 03:05:58,400
PC why practically everything

3665
03:05:58,400 --> 03:06:00,400
that I want to play on the console is on the PC

3666
03:06:00,400 --> 03:06:02,400
I can hook up a controller

3667
03:06:02,400 --> 03:06:04,400
to the PC and play it as it was a

3668
03:06:04,400 --> 03:06:06,400
console game plus I've got a whole bunch of other

3669
03:06:06,400 --> 03:06:08,400
games that were made specifically for PC

3670
03:06:08,400 --> 03:06:10,400
so it really expands my repertoire plus

3671
03:06:10,400 --> 03:06:12,400
I have emulators

3672
03:06:12,400 --> 03:06:14,400
for classic games

3673
03:06:14,400 --> 03:06:16,400
so technically I could also play

3674
03:06:16,400 --> 03:06:18,400
console games on my PC

3675
03:06:18,400 --> 03:06:20,400
with the right emulator

3676
03:06:20,400 --> 03:06:22,400
Loki PC because

3677
03:06:22,400 --> 03:06:24,400
it's an open platform versus a closed

3678
03:06:24,400 --> 03:06:26,400
platform that is on consoles

3679
03:06:26,400 --> 03:06:28,400
and also as Jamie mentioned

3680
03:06:28,400 --> 03:06:30,400
you can hook up a controller I mean

3681
03:06:30,400 --> 03:06:32,400
Xbox 360 controllers pretty much work with a lot of games

3682
03:06:32,400 --> 03:06:34,400
out there and well and it's

3683
03:06:34,400 --> 03:06:36,400
basically just like playing on a console hell I played

3684
03:06:36,400 --> 03:06:38,400
Crysis with an Xbox 360 controller

3685
03:06:38,400 --> 03:06:40,400
like it was a console game and

3686
03:06:40,400 --> 03:06:42,400
it was fine I played DC

3687
03:06:42,400 --> 03:06:44,400
Universe with an Xbox 360 controller

3688
03:06:44,400 --> 03:06:46,400
and it worked really well

3689
03:06:46,400 --> 03:06:48,400
Jason

3690
03:06:48,400 --> 03:06:50,400
Console gaming because if there were

3691
03:06:50,400 --> 03:06:52,400
a computer I have

3692
03:06:52,400 --> 03:06:54,400
completely admittedly

3693
03:06:54,400 --> 03:06:56,400
the library of games I want to play would not be

3694
03:06:56,400 --> 03:06:58,400
on the platform

3695
03:06:58,400 --> 03:07:00,400
because I'm sure

3696
03:07:00,400 --> 03:07:02,400
people who care will understand that

3697
03:07:02,400 --> 03:07:04,400
I'm gonna go

3698
03:07:04,400 --> 03:07:06,400
with PC as well and I think

3699
03:07:06,400 --> 03:07:08,400
for most of the same reasons as Jamie

3700
03:07:08,400 --> 03:07:10,400
it's not

3701
03:07:10,400 --> 03:07:12,400
that I necessarily prefer

3702
03:07:12,400 --> 03:07:14,400
PC over console I mean

3703
03:07:14,400 --> 03:07:16,400
they have their perks but

3704
03:07:16,400 --> 03:07:18,400
there are some games on PC that just are

3705
03:07:18,400 --> 03:07:20,400
never gonna happen on the console like Civ

3706
03:07:20,400 --> 03:07:22,400
Civ V not gonna happen

3707
03:07:22,400 --> 03:07:24,400
Typing of the Dead World of Warcraft

3708
03:07:24,400 --> 03:07:26,400
hello that's like the game I play

3709
03:07:26,400 --> 03:07:28,400
more than anything that's

3710
03:07:28,400 --> 03:07:30,400
you know PC only and

3711
03:07:30,400 --> 03:07:32,400
I was gonna say

3712
03:07:32,400 --> 03:07:34,400
the bit about emulators but she took the words out

3713
03:07:34,400 --> 03:07:36,400
of my mouth is that most of the classics you can

3714
03:07:36,400 --> 03:07:38,400
still get on PC whether

3715
03:07:38,400 --> 03:07:40,400
you know Spazinator would consider that

3716
03:07:40,400 --> 03:07:42,400
cheating or not I guess

3717
03:07:42,400 --> 03:07:44,400
is to be seen but I would say PC

3718
03:07:44,400 --> 03:07:46,400
gaming so

3719
03:07:46,400 --> 03:07:48,400
alright that's it for Twitter how about

3720
03:07:48,400 --> 03:07:50,400
anything else with

3721
03:07:50,400 --> 03:07:52,400
last minute stories Loki

3722
03:07:52,400 --> 03:07:54,400

um

3733
03:08:14,400 --> 03:08:16,400
been checking out

3734
03:08:16,400 --> 03:08:18,400
Wii U stuff

3735
03:08:18,400 --> 03:08:20,400
all day it seems pretty cool

3736
03:08:20,400 --> 03:08:22,400
yeah

3737
03:08:22,400 --> 03:08:24,400
um

3738
03:08:24,400 --> 03:08:26,400
I don't know I'm liking the whole

3739
03:08:26,400 --> 03:08:28,400
um

3740
03:08:28,400 --> 03:08:30,400
tablet thing and not

3741
03:08:30,400 --> 03:08:32,400
needing the TV on

3742
03:08:32,400 --> 03:08:34,400
if you don't even want to

3743
03:08:34,400 --> 03:08:36,400
feel like doing that

3744
03:08:36,400 --> 03:08:38,400
try to tell us a little bit like

3745
03:08:38,400 --> 03:08:40,400
you know I know that you are a listener of

3746
03:08:40,400 --> 03:08:42,400
ours who is blind and I

3747
03:08:42,400 --> 03:08:44,400
know you're very passionate about like that community

3748
03:08:44,400 --> 03:08:46,400
with obvious reasons of course

3749
03:08:46,400 --> 03:08:48,400
but tell us a little bit about

3750
03:08:48,400 --> 03:08:50,400
what maybe we're not all thinking about

3751
03:08:50,400 --> 03:08:52,400
when it comes to assessing this

3752
03:08:52,400 --> 03:08:54,400
new platform like what

3753
03:08:54,400 --> 03:08:56,400
accessibility features

3754
03:08:56,400 --> 03:08:58,400
does the Wii U really need to have for it

3755
03:08:58,400 --> 03:09:00,400
to be a console that you can sit here

3756
03:09:00,400 --> 03:09:02,400
and say I enjoy this

3757
03:09:02,400 --> 03:09:04,400
um well first of all

3758
03:09:04,400 --> 03:09:06,400
good games

3759
03:09:06,400 --> 03:09:08,400
that I care about and really

3760
03:09:08,400 --> 03:09:10,400
as it stands right now I don't think there's a whole lot

3761
03:09:10,400 --> 03:09:12,400
just like

3762
03:09:12,400 --> 03:09:14,400
how like the um

3763
03:09:14,400 --> 03:09:16,400
the Vita

3764
03:09:16,400 --> 03:09:18,400
kind of was you know it didn't really have

3765
03:09:18,400 --> 03:09:20,400
much starting

3766
03:09:20,400 --> 03:09:22,400
and it's slowly getting more and more games

3767
03:09:22,400 --> 03:09:24,400
that I care about

3768
03:09:24,400 --> 03:09:26,400
but um

3769
03:09:26,400 --> 03:09:28,400
what I like is I guess

3770
03:09:28,400 --> 03:09:30,400
the tablet actually does have a headphone

3771
03:09:30,400 --> 03:09:32,400
jack in it

3772
03:09:32,400 --> 03:09:34,400
so um

3773
03:09:34,400 --> 03:09:36,400
that's kind of cool um

3774
03:09:36,400 --> 03:09:38,400
obviously

3775
03:09:38,400 --> 03:09:40,400
um my big thing is

3776
03:09:40,400 --> 03:09:42,400
being able to use the

3777
03:09:42,400 --> 03:09:44,400
freaking buttons

3778
03:09:44,400 --> 03:09:46,400
you know for the menus

3779
03:09:46,400 --> 03:09:48,400
I honestly haven't explored that to see if that's a possibility

3780
03:09:48,400 --> 03:09:50,400
I um I've heard that

3781
03:09:50,400 --> 03:09:52,400
yeah you can for at least most things

3782
03:09:52,400 --> 03:09:54,400
woohoo so that's good

3783
03:09:54,400 --> 03:09:56,400
um I don't know if you caught my comment

3784
03:09:56,400 --> 03:09:58,400
earlier in the show but one of the things I really

3785
03:09:58,400 --> 03:10:00,400
love about the Wii U is the whole fact

3786
03:10:00,400 --> 03:10:02,400
that the sound on the TV

3787
03:10:02,400 --> 03:10:04,400
and the sound coming out

3788
03:10:04,400 --> 03:10:06,400
of the gamepad will

3789
03:10:06,400 --> 03:10:08,400
really compliment each other and I'm

3790
03:10:08,400 --> 03:10:10,400
not just talking about like the incidentals like we

3791
03:10:10,400 --> 03:10:12,400
were used to hearing with the Wii like

3792
03:10:12,400 --> 03:10:14,400
you know the little Wii mote would make sounds

3793
03:10:14,400 --> 03:10:16,400
once in a while but like the Wii U

3794
03:10:16,400 --> 03:10:18,400
full on like a musical soundtrack

3795
03:10:18,400 --> 03:10:20,400
will play out of the gamepad that compliments what's

3796
03:10:20,400 --> 03:10:22,400
going on on the TV and it creates

3797
03:10:22,400 --> 03:10:24,400
this sound experience that

3798
03:10:24,400 --> 03:10:26,400
no other console really has right now

3799
03:10:26,400 --> 03:10:28,400
I heard with Zombie U

3800
03:10:28,400 --> 03:10:30,400
um your radio

3801
03:10:30,400 --> 03:10:32,400
transmissions

3802
03:10:32,400 --> 03:10:34,400
like the stuff that you're getting

3803
03:10:34,400 --> 03:10:36,400
through you know your radio actually comes out

3804
03:10:36,400 --> 03:10:38,400
of the tablet which is

3805
03:10:38,400 --> 03:10:40,400
pretty neat yes and uh Batman

3806
03:10:40,400 --> 03:10:42,400
Arkham City does something similar if you are

3807
03:10:42,400 --> 03:10:44,400
close to the person you'll hear it from the

3808
03:10:44,400 --> 03:10:46,400
TV if you're far away you'll hear

3809
03:10:46,400 --> 03:10:48,400
it on the tablet oh that

3810
03:10:48,400 --> 03:10:50,400
is cool yeah yeah yeah that's very

3811
03:10:50,400 --> 03:10:52,400
cool um now what I'm curious about

3812
03:10:52,400 --> 03:10:54,400
is I wonder like

3813
03:10:54,400 --> 03:10:56,400
if

3814
03:10:56,400 --> 03:10:58,400
all of the game audio like

3815
03:10:58,400 --> 03:11:00,400
say if you have your

3816
03:11:00,400 --> 03:11:02,400
TV doing

3817
03:11:02,400 --> 03:11:04,400
something else and

3818
03:11:04,400 --> 03:11:06,400
you're just using the controller

3819
03:11:06,400 --> 03:11:08,400
I wonder if uh all of your game

3820
03:11:08,400 --> 03:11:10,400
audio is going to be uh

3821
03:11:10,400 --> 03:11:12,400
streamed as well or if it's just gonna be

3822
03:11:12,400 --> 03:11:14,400
the incidentals that's what

3823
03:11:14,400 --> 03:11:16,400
I'm curious about I think it depends on the game

3824
03:11:16,400 --> 03:11:18,400
yeah I was I would have to say I would have

3825
03:11:18,400 --> 03:11:20,400
to if I would have to take an educated guess

3826
03:11:20,400 --> 03:11:22,400
can uh Rob was playing Mario

3827
03:11:22,400 --> 03:11:24,400
and it was the the

3828
03:11:24,400 --> 03:11:26,400
gamepad experience versus the TV was

3829
03:11:26,400 --> 03:11:28,400
identical um I would

3830
03:11:28,400 --> 03:11:30,400
assume that when headphones are in there I didn't

3831
03:11:30,400 --> 03:11:32,400
I didn't really hear anything coming

3832
03:11:32,400 --> 03:11:34,400
the music was not identical because they

3833
03:11:34,400 --> 03:11:36,400
were complimenting each other but most

3834
03:11:36,400 --> 03:11:38,400
of the sound effects see you probably couldn't hear it all

3835
03:11:38,400 --> 03:11:40,400
the way back here because you're just hearing

3836
03:11:40,400 --> 03:11:42,400
all the sound from the side of the room but when you're sitting

3837
03:11:42,400 --> 03:11:44,400
right there you hear it it's really

3838
03:11:44,400 --> 03:11:46,400
cool the two things the two things

3839
03:11:46,400 --> 03:11:48,400
to consider really really quick with that is that one

3840
03:11:48,400 --> 03:11:50,400
it may it may become smarter when

3841
03:11:50,400 --> 03:11:52,400
it sees that headphones are plugged in

3842
03:11:52,400 --> 03:11:54,400
that's what I was thinking yeah and second

3843
03:11:54,400 --> 03:11:56,400
there are options on like when you were doing

3844
03:11:56,400 --> 03:11:58,400
the chat there's options to shut off

3845
03:11:58,400 --> 03:12:00,400
the TV so maybe when it knows one

3846
03:12:00,400 --> 03:12:02,400
medium is gone it brings everything to the

3847
03:12:02,400 --> 03:12:04,400
gamepad that's true yeah

3848
03:12:04,400 --> 03:12:06,400
also I wanted to bring up word of caution

3849
03:12:06,400 --> 03:12:08,400
for those that um

3850
03:12:08,400 --> 03:12:10,400
are big fans of

3851
03:12:10,400 --> 03:12:12,400
uh Super Smash Brothers

3852
03:12:12,400 --> 03:12:14,400
Brawl with um

3853
03:12:14,400 --> 03:12:16,400
particularly with the GameCube

3854
03:12:16,400 --> 03:12:18,400
controls

3855
03:12:18,400 --> 03:12:20,400
um don't get rid of your Wii

3856
03:12:21,400 --> 03:12:23,400
cause Wii U doesn't have GameCube ports

3857
03:12:23,400 --> 03:12:25,400
oh that's a very good point

3858
03:12:25,400 --> 03:12:27,400
there are no ports

3859
03:12:27,400 --> 03:12:29,400
and general consensus from

3860
03:12:29,400 --> 03:12:31,400
many many people that I've seen

3861
03:12:31,400 --> 03:12:33,400
is GameCube

3862
03:12:33,400 --> 03:12:35,400
controllers kind of the best way to play Brawl

3863
03:12:35,400 --> 03:12:37,400
what about the pro controller

3864
03:12:37,400 --> 03:12:39,400
oh I guess maybe it wouldn't work

3865
03:12:39,400 --> 03:12:41,400
that wouldn't work with Brawl though

3866
03:12:41,400 --> 03:12:43,400
yikes

3867
03:12:43,400 --> 03:12:45,400
they need to bring back

3868
03:12:45,400 --> 03:12:47,400
bring back the wave bird

3869
03:12:47,400 --> 03:12:49,400
no shit the wave bird was

3870
03:12:49,400 --> 03:12:51,400
the only thing the wave bird was missing was rumble

3871
03:12:51,400 --> 03:12:53,400
that would have been

3872
03:12:53,400 --> 03:12:55,400
that would have made it perfect

3873
03:12:55,400 --> 03:12:57,400
but that is probably

3874
03:12:57,400 --> 03:12:59,400
one of my favorite controllers

3875
03:12:59,400 --> 03:13:01,400
still it was a good

3876
03:13:01,400 --> 03:13:03,400
good controller but I think it's nice

3877
03:13:03,400 --> 03:13:05,400
and sturdy and just

3878
03:13:05,400 --> 03:13:07,400
I have my collection of

3879
03:13:07,400 --> 03:13:09,400
wave birds

3880
03:13:09,400 --> 03:13:11,400
I do actually have four wave birds

3881
03:13:11,400 --> 03:13:13,400
one of them is an E3

3882
03:13:13,400 --> 03:13:15,400
wave bird nice

3883
03:13:15,400 --> 03:13:17,400
that my friend sold me

3884
03:13:17,400 --> 03:13:19,400
alright sirlock I gotta let you go so we can wrap up

3885
03:13:19,400 --> 03:13:21,400
but any other comments before we let you go

3886
03:13:21,400 --> 03:13:23,400
um

3887
03:13:23,400 --> 03:13:25,400
that has nothing to do with games

3888
03:13:25,400 --> 03:13:27,400
but um

3889
03:13:27,400 --> 03:13:29,400
swear to god

3890
03:13:29,400 --> 03:13:31,400
saw a I don't know if it's still there

3891
03:13:31,400 --> 03:13:33,400
but there was

3892
03:13:33,400 --> 03:13:35,400
a single box of

3893
03:13:35,400 --> 03:13:37,400
Twinkies on eBay

3894
03:13:37,400 --> 03:13:39,400
with a buy it now of ten thousand

3895
03:13:39,400 --> 03:13:41,400
dollars I'm not kidding

3896
03:13:41,400 --> 03:13:43,400
fucking ridiculous

3897
03:13:43,400 --> 03:13:45,400
I know right

3898
03:13:45,400 --> 03:13:47,400
they're gold plated

3899
03:13:47,400 --> 03:13:49,400
you know all that shit's gonna be bought out

3900
03:13:49,400 --> 03:13:51,400
don't

3901
03:13:51,400 --> 03:13:53,400
we'll be fine

3902
03:13:53,400 --> 03:13:55,400
Twinkies aren't even that good anyway

3903
03:13:55,400 --> 03:13:57,400
shit my thing is ding dongs

3904
03:13:57,400 --> 03:13:59,400
little Debbie's strawberry shortcakes are the bomb

3905
03:13:59,400 --> 03:14:01,400
nutty bars

3906
03:14:01,400 --> 03:14:03,400
nutty bars are pretty fucking good too

3907
03:14:03,400 --> 03:14:05,400
we have two Weird Al references with hostess products

3908
03:14:05,400 --> 03:14:07,400
ding dong man ding dong

3909
03:14:07,400 --> 03:14:09,400
ding dong yo

3910
03:14:09,400 --> 03:14:11,400
and

3911
03:14:11,400 --> 03:14:13,400
the Twinkie wiener sandwich

3912
03:14:13,400 --> 03:14:15,400
yes

3913
03:14:15,400 --> 03:14:17,400
the only Twinkie that I accept

3914
03:14:17,400 --> 03:14:19,400
is a deep fried Twinkie

3915
03:14:19,400 --> 03:14:21,400
I only could eat half of one

3916
03:14:21,400 --> 03:14:23,400
when we did those at the tourney

3917
03:14:23,400 --> 03:14:25,400
I don't know that just sounds like

3918
03:14:25,400 --> 03:14:27,400
a part of DDR's history in Sacramento

3919
03:14:27,400 --> 03:14:29,400
has died

3920
03:14:29,400 --> 03:14:31,400
because we had the only

3921
03:14:31,400 --> 03:14:33,400
DDR tournament ever to sell

3922
03:14:33,400 --> 03:14:35,400
deep fried Twinkies

3923
03:14:35,400 --> 03:14:37,400
why?

3924
03:14:37,400 --> 03:14:39,400
why the fuck not bitch

3925
03:14:39,400 --> 03:14:41,400
distinguishing factor you have there

3926
03:14:41,400 --> 03:14:43,400
dude in Sacramento

3927
03:14:43,400 --> 03:14:45,400
we did it fucked up

3928
03:14:45,400 --> 03:14:47,400
because our first tournament was

3929
03:14:47,400 --> 03:14:49,400
scat Sacramento

3930
03:14:49,400 --> 03:14:51,400
cosplay and tournament

3931
03:14:51,400 --> 03:14:53,400

3932
03:14:53,400 --> 03:14:55,400
and it was

3933
03:14:55,400 --> 03:14:57,400
great

3934
03:14:57,400 --> 03:14:59,400
there was a NES game

3935
03:14:59,400 --> 03:15:01,400
called scat

3936
03:15:01,400 --> 03:15:03,400
yes there was

3937
03:15:03,400 --> 03:15:05,400

03:15:05,400 --> 03:15:07,400
well I gotta give this call the

3939

3947
03:15:23,400 --> 03:15:25,400

it's actually kind of a hard question besides

3976
03:16:21,400 --> 03:16:23,400
social networks I don't really care

3977
03:16:23,400 --> 03:16:25,400
twitter.com is the old standard

3978
03:16:25,400 --> 03:16:27,400
follow your life in 140 characters

3979
03:16:27,400 --> 03:16:29,400
140 characters at a time twitter.com

3980
03:16:29,400 --> 03:16:31,400
there you go or just

3981
03:16:31,400 --> 03:16:33,400
come to the chat room and say hey

3982
03:16:33,400 --> 03:16:35,400

3983
03:16:35,400 --> 03:16:37,400

3984
03:16:37,400 --> 03:16:39,400

03:16:45,400 --> 03:16:47,400
Jamie your final thought tonight

3989
03:16:47,400 --> 03:16:49,400
Boycott Black Friday

3990
03:16:49,400 --> 03:16:51,400
my final thought

3991
03:16:51,400 --> 03:16:53,400
is sounds good to me

3992
03:16:53,400 --> 03:16:55,400
because I'm going to sleep in

3993
03:16:55,400 --> 03:16:57,400
Cyber Monday

3994
03:16:57,400 --> 03:16:59,400
Boycott Black Friday if you're going to get your retail

3995
03:16:59,400 --> 03:17:01,400
consumerism on

3996
03:17:01,400 --> 03:17:03,400
do it on Cyber Monday buy all your stuff online

3997
03:17:03,400 --> 03:17:05,400
hand make a gift make your cards

3998
03:17:05,400 --> 03:17:07,400
hire me to design your cards

3999
03:17:07,400 --> 03:17:09,400
but do something

4000
03:17:09,400 --> 03:17:11,400
that isn't going to give in to the whole corporate

4001
03:17:11,400 --> 03:17:13,400
bullshit I'm sick of it let's just

4002
03:17:13,400 --> 03:17:15,400
show them that people aren't going to

4003
03:17:15,400 --> 03:17:17,400
live by being

4004
03:17:17,400 --> 03:17:19,400
oh I forgot Rob sorry

4005
03:17:19,400 --> 03:17:21,400
by being consumer horse

4006
03:17:21,400 --> 03:17:23,400
my final thought

4007
03:17:23,400 --> 03:17:25,400
is Jamie's going to be moving to Berkeley

4008
03:17:25,400 --> 03:17:27,400
pretty soon so she can go be with her people

4009
03:17:27,400 --> 03:17:29,400

4010
03:17:29,400 --> 03:17:31,400
also also

4011
03:17:31,400 --> 03:17:33,400
there's no excuse to belt a child

4012
03:17:33,400 --> 03:17:35,400
ever

4013
03:17:35,400 --> 03:17:37,400
my final thought is reject

03:17:37,400 --> 03:17:39,400
