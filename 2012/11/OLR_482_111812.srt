00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:25,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight, November 18th, 2012, the Wii U launches in North America, loyal Microsoft users are rewarded with a free Xbox 360, and PlayStation Plus is set to debut on the Vita.

2
00:00:31,457 --> 00:00:36,880
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,642
[SPEAKER_15]: It is Orange Lounge Radio.

4
00:00:40,102 --> 00:00:46,686
[SPEAKER_15]: My name is Rob Roberts and I'll be joining you over the next few hours to talk about video games and gaming culture and the gamer lifestyle with my buddies.

5
00:00:47,026 --> 00:00:49,348
[SPEAKER_15]: Say hello first off to DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.

6
00:00:49,687 --> 00:00:49,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

7
00:00:50,347 --> 00:00:50,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, how are you?

8
00:00:51,908 --> 00:00:53,168
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sick of donuts.

9
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:54,909
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, God.

10
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:56,810
[SPEAKER_15]: Not the hostess thing.

11
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,091
[SPEAKER_15]: Were you one of those people clearing out 7-Eleven?

12
00:00:59,431 --> 00:00:59,671
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

13
00:00:59,911 --> 00:01:01,071
[SPEAKER_07]: No, actually not at all.

14
00:01:01,231 --> 00:01:03,572
[SPEAKER_07]: I was watching Under Sedation Live last night.

15
00:01:03,592 --> 00:01:04,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

16
00:01:07,017 --> 00:01:35,699
[SPEAKER_07]: And they were eating, well Travis was eating Ding Dongs, Twinkies, all kinds of stuff And all of a sudden I wanted donuts And this Martin Funnel around the corner from my house had them So I bought ten of them and gave a pack to a homeless guy And the rest of them are now in my fridge at home So should I have the urge to eat a donut Which I really shouldn't be because wheat makes me sick But I have them now I ate a pack today, I wish I hadn't

17
00:01:36,593 --> 00:01:52,973
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's the thing, like, you know, I'm not going to get into the whole why about it, but I'm going to tell you why the closure pisses me off is because Hostess also makes, and I don't know if this is a nationwide thing, it might be a regional thing, but they make this bread called Columbo bread, which is like the sourdough bread that is so flipping good.

18
00:01:52,993 --> 00:01:54,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Columbo is its own brand.

19
00:01:55,003 --> 00:01:55,884
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, but it's part of Hostess.

20
00:01:55,944 --> 00:01:57,945
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, right, but Columbo also makes frozen yogurt.

21
00:01:58,325 --> 00:01:58,665
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay.

22
00:01:59,005 --> 00:02:07,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Columbo also makes a bunch of other baked goods, but they also do... Because it used to be a major competitor for the company that my dad used to work for.

23
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:11,133
[SPEAKER_07]: My dad used to work for a distributor called W.J.

24
00:02:11,153 --> 00:02:13,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Powell Company, and they did a different bread for their supplier.

25
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:17,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Columbo was one of the big southern competitors.

26
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,971
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I always thought they were based out here.

27
00:02:21,092 --> 00:02:22,553
[SPEAKER_14]: Because San Francisco is sourdough bread.

28
00:02:23,294 --> 00:02:26,096
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but they also do other kinds of breads.

29
00:02:26,216 --> 00:02:27,617
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a national bread company.

30
00:02:27,998 --> 00:02:31,561
[SPEAKER_07]: And they also do frozen yogurt and other, what's the word I'm thinking of?

31
00:02:32,101 --> 00:02:33,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Mass distribution foods.

32
00:02:33,262 --> 00:02:38,606
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, my point was, I'm not going to be able to get that sourdough bread anymore, at least until somebody buys the company or whatever.

33
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:40,268
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you can go to fucking Boudin and get good bread.

34
00:02:40,288 --> 00:02:40,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

35
00:02:42,025 --> 00:02:43,786
[SPEAKER_15]: But I love Columbo bread, you shut up.

36
00:02:44,246 --> 00:02:46,507
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, say hello to the one and only Techmaster Loki.

37
00:02:46,927 --> 00:02:51,210
[SPEAKER_15]: I completely was ignoring everything you guys were talking about for the last minute or two.

38
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,011
[SPEAKER_15]: Hostess, you don't have an opinion on Twinkies?

39
00:02:54,271 --> 00:02:55,412
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't like them.

40
00:02:56,312 --> 00:03:00,314
[SPEAKER_15]: I think people are going way too crazy over this, but it's because everybody remembers them from a kid.

41
00:03:00,794 --> 00:03:06,857
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know about you guys, but a Twinkie was like a staple dessert that came with your little bag lunch.

42
00:03:07,378 --> 00:03:08,958
[SPEAKER_13]: Holy crap, it's cake with frosting inside.

43
00:03:08,998 --> 00:03:09,779
[SPEAKER_13]: Ours were Star Crunch.

44
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:14,061
[SPEAKER_13]: Wow, no one will ever be able to do that.

45
00:03:14,802 --> 00:03:15,622
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Little Debbie.

46
00:03:16,383 --> 00:03:19,605
[SPEAKER_15]: If you eat Little Debbie stuff, strawberry shortcakes are superior.

47
00:03:19,645 --> 00:03:20,325
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.

48
00:03:20,885 --> 00:03:23,007
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all about oat milk cream pies.

49
00:03:23,027 --> 00:03:31,572
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if they actually had a hostess end cap or whatever at our local grocery store, and now that's all Little Debbie stuff now.

50
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,093
[SPEAKER_13]: They just completely removed it all.

51
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:36,075
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if they had to return it all before their...

52
00:03:38,796 --> 00:03:42,398
[SPEAKER_15]: Little Debbie was probably the one that, you know, convinced them all to join the union and all that.

53
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:42,758
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I'm kidding.

54
00:03:42,778 --> 00:03:43,218
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm kidding.

55
00:03:43,498 --> 00:03:44,038
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want to go there.

56
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:44,258
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

57
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,261
[SPEAKER_15]: Also say hello to the one, the only, Jason is joining us in the studio tonight.

58
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:50,521
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello again, everybody.

59
00:03:50,781 --> 00:03:54,643
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. VX, Jason X, VX, YZ, QR, STUP.

60
00:03:54,963 --> 00:03:55,663
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

61
00:03:55,683 --> 00:03:56,384
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, for me.

62
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:57,224
[SPEAKER_16]: How you doing?

63
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:03,707
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm tired from zipping south of San Francisco and north of San Francisco and...

64
00:04:04,387 --> 00:04:06,929
[SPEAKER_16]: Train for much too long as usual.

65
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:08,810
[SPEAKER_16]: But I'm here, so why not?

66
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,791
[SPEAKER_15]: And commuting back and forth from Colorado.

67
00:04:11,112 --> 00:04:11,452
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh-huh.

68
00:04:12,372 --> 00:04:16,735
[SPEAKER_15]: Which, by the way, being that you... See, politics is pretty bad here.

69
00:04:17,696 --> 00:04:20,037
[SPEAKER_15]: Because, you know, it's bad everywhere.

70
00:04:20,077 --> 00:04:21,858
[SPEAKER_15]: But at least we're not a swing state.

71
00:04:22,159 --> 00:04:24,020
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody knew how California was going to vote.

72
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,340
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah.

73
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,563
[SPEAKER_15]: Your state, on the other hand, oh my god, you must be really fucking sick of politics.

74
00:04:29,663 --> 00:04:30,324
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is... I...

75
00:04:32,225 --> 00:04:33,165
[SPEAKER_16]: Not watching TV.

76
00:04:33,766 --> 00:04:42,649
[SPEAKER_16]: The only exposure to politics that I had was every once in a while that Facebook, either a sponsored post or a friend liking something that shows up on my feed.

77
00:04:43,069 --> 00:04:44,569
[SPEAKER_16]: It was surprisingly minimal.

78
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,751
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't get too much of it, and I could very easily just skim the sponsored posts.

79
00:04:50,112 --> 00:04:59,916
[SPEAKER_16]: But the one thing that I did get is YouTube partner channels, the ones that actually monetize their channel, politic two-minute political ads every single video.

80
00:05:00,437 --> 00:05:07,500
[SPEAKER_16]: And there have been a couple of gaming shows, The Continue Show, Game Grumps, and then individually Jon, Sean, and Egoraptor.

81
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,662
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been watching a ton of their videos, and they all monetize.

82
00:05:11,022 --> 00:05:16,925
[SPEAKER_16]: So the start of every episode, the end of every episode, for whatever reason, even though you can just skip it,

83
00:05:17,485 --> 00:05:23,330
[SPEAKER_16]: and the middle of particularly long episodes, political ad, political ad, political ad, political ad, political ad.

84
00:05:23,871 --> 00:05:27,474
[SPEAKER_16]: So it wasn't terribly specific for my region, but it still sucked.

85
00:05:27,574 --> 00:05:32,518
[SPEAKER_15]: This is why you don't see Wii U commercials anywhere because the politicians bought up all the ad space.

86
00:05:32,538 --> 00:05:33,239
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, they really did.

87
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:33,679
[SPEAKER_16]: There it is.

88
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,923
[SPEAKER_16]: My fun trivia about politics, since we're on the subject to get it out of the way...

89
00:05:38,643 --> 00:05:41,445
[SPEAKER_16]: How many presidential candidates were on the Colorado ballot?

90
00:05:41,465 --> 00:05:41,686
[SPEAKER_16]: How many?

91
00:05:41,726 --> 00:05:41,966
[SPEAKER_16]: Sixteen.

92
00:06:05,723 --> 00:06:06,023
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow.

93
00:06:06,223 --> 00:06:06,644
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

94
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:16,231
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if it was sarcastic, but somebody told me that the only thing you have to do to get on the ballot is to have some kind of party application.

95
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,552
[SPEAKER_16]: You have to have some kind of a political party and pay $500.

96
00:06:18,852 --> 00:06:26,418
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, okay, I'm not going to ask you how you voted in elections because that's a touchy subject and whatever, but also I do want to remind everybody.

97
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,400
[SPEAKER_15]: Duke Nukem says don't fuck with Roseanne

98
00:06:49,998 --> 00:06:57,908
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not going to ask about the big one because that's still got a lot of ruffled feathers and so forth, but I gotta know.

99
00:06:59,110 --> 00:06:59,851
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

100
00:07:22,794 --> 00:07:26,295
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually eat all that snacky food because I'm just a fat pig.

101
00:07:26,415 --> 00:07:28,455
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, I'm not even smoking weed.

102
00:07:28,495 --> 00:07:29,195
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just a fat pig.

103
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,816
[SPEAKER_16]: But how do you feel about all that, being in that state?

104
00:07:32,936 --> 00:07:44,478
[SPEAKER_16]: The best thing that's come out of this is the humor on Facebook and the local communities because of how many people I follow that live in the area go figure that the jokes, the pictures, the memes, they are actually pretty damn funny.

105
00:07:44,618 --> 00:07:47,579
[SPEAKER_15]: Getting high while you are actually high in the Mile High City?

106
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,401
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a new one to me, actually.

107
00:07:50,421 --> 00:07:52,383
[SPEAKER_07]: I just like the one of the fog rolling in.

108
00:07:52,623 --> 00:07:53,363
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, yes.

109
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:54,884
[SPEAKER_16]: Suddenly in Colorado.

110
00:07:56,085 --> 00:08:06,093
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, my favorite as well is the whole fact that it's a fucking cruel joke that Hostess closes the week after they legalize marijuana in two states.

111
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:09,836
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's like, what kind of fucking stupid business decision was that?

112
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,191
[SPEAKER_15]: You own Twinkies.

113
00:08:14,231 --> 00:08:15,913
[SPEAKER_15]: You were sitting on a gold mine.

114
00:08:16,594 --> 00:08:24,442
[SPEAKER_07]: They were too busy giving themselves raises and not worrying about things like benefits and pensions.

115
00:08:24,722 --> 00:08:26,464
[SPEAKER_15]: Fucking greedy ass fuckers.

116
00:08:26,604 --> 00:08:40,788
[SPEAKER_15]: But since we're all under the age of 50, I'm sure we can agree that yay to those states that finally voted the right way and either legalized or stopped the banning of marriage and all that.

117
00:08:40,928 --> 00:08:42,768
[SPEAKER_15]: So yay to Washington and all that.

118
00:08:42,908 --> 00:08:48,470
[SPEAKER_16]: It makes it more difficult because we have to watch out for state officials.

119
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:53,651
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't have to watch out for state officials, but when we hear about a federal raid, then it becomes a little bit more dangerous because...

120
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:58,814
[SPEAKER_16]: As the disclaimer goes, it is still illegal at the federal level, which ultimately supersedes state law.

121
00:08:59,775 --> 00:09:00,055
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

122
00:09:00,115 --> 00:09:01,656
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyhow, we got to get to video games.

123
00:09:01,696 --> 00:09:03,177
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been a busy week in video games.

124
00:09:03,217 --> 00:09:04,318
[SPEAKER_15]: We're getting too political.

125
00:09:05,239 --> 00:09:05,559
[SPEAKER_15]: Shut up.

126
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:06,760
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't talk about politics.

127
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,101
[SPEAKER_15]: I tuned in to hear about games.

128
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:08,941
[SPEAKER_15]: Fine.

129
00:09:09,302 --> 00:09:10,462
[SPEAKER_15]: We can talk games.

130
00:09:10,903 --> 00:09:16,066
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's talk about Wii U. Obviously, Wii U. Yeah, everybody's heard that joke.

131
00:09:16,466 --> 00:09:21,390
[SPEAKER_15]: But in part to Bobby, who does the show before us every week.

132
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,352
[SPEAKER_15]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

133
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:39,938
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, did you buy the Wii U?

134
00:09:40,138 --> 00:09:40,779
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not a whore.

135
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:44,021
[SPEAKER_15]: So that means it's between Loki and myself.

136
00:09:44,101 --> 00:09:47,283
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, Loki, you do work for the distribution company.

137
00:09:47,563 --> 00:09:49,064
[SPEAKER_15]: I do work for the distribution company.

138
00:09:49,124 --> 00:09:53,167
[SPEAKER_15]: And you've been shading the shit out of Nintendo on the past few episodes of the show.

139
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:53,907
[SPEAKER_15]: That's true.

140
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:56,509
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you have a change of heart and did you buy a Wii U?

141
00:09:57,249 --> 00:09:58,270
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I already own a Wii.

142
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:00,466
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, it was me.

143
00:10:00,626 --> 00:10:01,988
[SPEAKER_15]: I bought the Wii U this morning.

144
00:10:02,008 --> 00:10:02,568
[SPEAKER_15]: Surprise.

145
00:10:02,628 --> 00:10:03,329
[SPEAKER_15]: I did, yep.

146
00:10:04,891 --> 00:10:06,693
[SPEAKER_15]: So let's talk about the Wii U a little bit.

147
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,516
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess I'll start since, you know, I actually have one.

148
00:10:10,017 --> 00:10:10,878
[SPEAKER_15]: No, here's the thing.

149
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:14,222
[SPEAKER_15]: I went back and forth on that Wii U thing a lot.

150
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:16,424
[SPEAKER_15]: I made a very cryptic tweet last night.

151
00:10:17,285 --> 00:10:18,825
[SPEAKER_15]: Talking about, because here's the thing.

152
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:28,828
[SPEAKER_15]: I chose not to go out and stand in line and all that stuff for the Wii U last night because Irene, who a lot of you old school OLR listeners know because she used to be on the show all the time.

153
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:34,230
[SPEAKER_15]: Irene was visiting and I make it sound like she doesn't live here, but she came over.

154
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,370
[SPEAKER_15]: We went out for her birthday.

155
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:40,311
[SPEAKER_15]: So I chose to go get drunk at a gay bar rather than go stand out in line.

156
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,672
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I made the right decision.

157
00:10:42,472 --> 00:10:44,574
[SPEAKER_15]: So I pretty much convinced myself, you know what?

158
00:10:44,654 --> 00:10:46,435
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't need a Wii U. I'm not going to get one.

159
00:10:46,695 --> 00:10:47,276
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm over it.

160
00:10:47,556 --> 00:10:49,137
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I'll get one in January or whatever.

161
00:10:49,798 --> 00:10:55,922
[SPEAKER_15]: And then this morning, I fire up the Target app and I just look out of curiosity.

162
00:10:56,382 --> 00:10:57,443
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like 11 o'clock.

163
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:27,155
[SPEAKER_15]: they're still in stock at the store nearby let's just go take a look walk out of there with my Wii U Deluxe set not only are you a whore I found one at noon still on a shelf in Target not only are you a whore, you're a waffling whore so they're not sold out like the Wii oh I guess they probably are now to be fair because there were two left and I bought one see Nintendo, Apple helps you sell your stuff if you're going to pick any mobile platform Apple

164
00:11:27,795 --> 00:11:29,756
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure that isn't a surprise to hear me say, ever.

165
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:41,643
[SPEAKER_15]: So to be honest, I've only really been able to spend like 30 minutes playing actual games on the console because as I'm sure you all heard, there's that massive 5GB update and that took an hour out and I had to do other stuff to prep for the show.

166
00:11:42,003 --> 00:11:45,565
[SPEAKER_15]: So I didn't have a whole lot of time to really sit down with the Wii U, but I'm going to tell you like this.

167
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:51,128
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the impression I got of the Wii U with the little time I had playing it.

168
00:11:51,548 --> 00:11:53,071
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

169
00:12:03,596 --> 00:12:05,598
[SPEAKER_07]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

170
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:29,797
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

171
00:12:52,822 --> 00:12:53,363
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

172
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:08,861
[SPEAKER_07]: All that stuff.

173
00:13:08,881 --> 00:13:23,493
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a reason I have DarkSakura tell that story because that's how I kind of feel about the Wii U is that like there's these doors that you'll open and there's a wall there and there'll be like a half-finished tunnel and it's like, oh, you can click on Amazon Prime and then it's like, surprise, it's fucking nothing.

174
00:13:23,974 --> 00:13:24,895
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, like that gif.

175
00:13:25,235 --> 00:13:32,261
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like there's all these weird unfinished things and I really feel like so much of the infrastructure they're building as they go along.

176
00:13:32,481 --> 00:13:32,681
[SPEAKER_15]: Like,

177
00:13:33,402 --> 00:13:35,385
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

178
00:13:49,424 --> 00:13:50,926
[SPEAKER_15]: I also really love the subtle touch.

179
00:14:08,068 --> 00:14:09,069
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a neat little thing.

180
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:09,950
[SPEAKER_15]: I like that.

181
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:31,497
[SPEAKER_15]: So yes, Loki, I know you're dying to comment on my consumer whoredom, so please.

182
00:14:31,677 --> 00:14:36,241
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm just saying that I don't know why you're surprised that there's stuff that's not finished for the Wii U launch.

183
00:14:36,261 --> 00:14:39,863
[SPEAKER_13]: They did the same thing with the Wii, the DS, the 3DS.

184
00:14:40,084 --> 00:14:45,628
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just Nintendo, and they're... Well, we want people to buy our stuff, but oh hey, it's not complete.

185
00:14:47,506 --> 00:14:51,030
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, all those wonderful features that we were pimping out during our E3 conferences.

186
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:52,131
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, TV!

187
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,092
[SPEAKER_13]: Nintendo TV.

188
00:14:53,472 --> 00:14:54,273
[SPEAKER_13]: Nope, not fucking there.

189
00:14:55,034 --> 00:14:56,255
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, hey, Rayman Legends.

190
00:14:56,335 --> 00:14:57,476
[SPEAKER_13]: Really awesome launch game.

191
00:14:57,636 --> 00:14:58,237
[SPEAKER_13]: Launch window.

192
00:14:58,437 --> 00:15:00,980
[SPEAKER_13]: By launch window, he means coming out five months later.

193
00:15:02,648 --> 00:15:03,489
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, come on!

194
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:29,990
[SPEAKER_15]: Your typical pack-in game.

195
00:15:30,831 --> 00:15:35,415
[SPEAKER_15]: I only did a little bit of Nintendo Land, but I like some of the variety in some of the games.

196
00:15:35,495 --> 00:15:41,080
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think it's Wii Sports level going to draw people in, but I think it's a neat way to show off the console.

197
00:15:42,661 --> 00:15:48,286
[SPEAKER_15]: I did a video chat too with Shane, and it's okay.

198
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:50,849
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, the quality is kind of comparable to FaceTime.

199
00:15:51,489 --> 00:16:16,859
[SPEAKER_15]: it's a little slow to connect and then like it does this really weird transition thing when you connect to the other person where it like ripples in and it plays like this music like like it's like this big debut like oh my god I'm gonna video chat like ta-da and then like oh hey it's Shane like I haven't seen him before like you know like it's just like oh your prince is in another castle but here's Shane

200
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:21,456
[SPEAKER_13]: Poor Shane.

201
00:16:22,656 --> 00:16:27,718
[SPEAKER_15]: But the quality was good enough that I could see his doggy running down the stairs in the back of the room.

202
00:16:27,758 --> 00:16:28,418
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was like, oh.

203
00:16:28,778 --> 00:16:35,159
[SPEAKER_15]: Although when he was looking at my setup, Jason was sitting back here at the table.

204
00:16:35,299 --> 00:16:36,960
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm like, Shane, say hi to Jason.

205
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,040
[SPEAKER_15]: He's like, hi.

206
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,641
[SPEAKER_15]: He's doing that whole, I don't know who I'm saying hi to.

207
00:16:40,961 --> 00:16:45,902
[SPEAKER_15]: And he told me later, he's like, yeah, I couldn't see Jason, but I could totally make out the Wendy's bag that was sitting on the table.

208
00:16:45,962 --> 00:16:46,882
[SPEAKER_15]: So I know where he ate dinner.

209
00:16:48,823 --> 00:16:49,223
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeesh.

210
00:16:50,503 --> 00:16:50,743
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

211
00:16:50,783 --> 00:16:52,244
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's how I really want to be remembered.

212
00:16:52,844 --> 00:16:53,645
[SPEAKER_16]: My last meal.

213
00:16:56,206 --> 00:16:57,386
[SPEAKER_15]: And then you can draw on it.

214
00:16:57,886 --> 00:17:01,348
[SPEAKER_15]: But, you know, so I was writing like hello and like all that stupid stuff.

215
00:17:01,728 --> 00:17:06,450
[SPEAKER_15]: So anyway, my time with the Wii U has been interesting so far.

216
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,731
[SPEAKER_15]: I think they're going to kind of keep adding to it.

217
00:17:09,051 --> 00:17:11,612
[SPEAKER_15]: And at the end of the day, if you want a Wii U, you just have to ask yourself,

218
00:17:12,252 --> 00:17:13,453
[SPEAKER_15]: How bad do I want the games?

219
00:17:13,814 --> 00:17:17,316
[SPEAKER_15]: Because the infrastructure right now is not really where it's at.

220
00:17:17,777 --> 00:17:22,700
[SPEAKER_15]: There's still a lot of... I want to be able to explain Miiverse to all of you.

221
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,502
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't fucking understand it at all.

222
00:17:25,742 --> 00:17:30,246
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought it was supposed to be like Twitter, but you don't really make public posts.

223
00:17:30,626 --> 00:17:36,290
[SPEAKER_15]: You can either send messages to people or you comment on community posts, which in turn are public.

224
00:17:37,331 --> 00:17:39,052
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't fucking get it.

225
00:17:39,953 --> 00:17:40,533
[SPEAKER_13]: It's okay.

226
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,074
[SPEAKER_13]: Nintendo doesn't fucking get it either.

227
00:17:43,474 --> 00:17:45,855
[SPEAKER_13]: They just put this shit together and like, done.

228
00:17:46,095 --> 00:17:48,116
[SPEAKER_13]: It looks like Facebook or Twitter.

229
00:17:48,496 --> 00:17:51,317
[SPEAKER_13]: We're gonna just say this is our online network right here.

230
00:17:53,037 --> 00:17:58,679
[SPEAKER_15]: Ragenator in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, So, what was the TTP for the newer listeners?

231
00:17:58,699 --> 00:18:01,200
[SPEAKER_15]: That's an old OLR acronym for time to penis.

232
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:05,542
[SPEAKER_15]: Whenever there is a new piece of hardware, we always measure what's gonna be the time before somebody puts their dick in it.

233
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:06,942
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I'm sure it was a few seconds, but

234
00:18:07,603 --> 00:18:10,547
[SPEAKER_15]: No, because he's asking, what was the TTP with the video chat?

235
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:14,153
[SPEAKER_15]: Shane and I were just friends, so that was not a thing.

236
00:18:14,634 --> 00:18:19,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, but I'm sure somebody else... But Rob totally had a penis up on his iPhone.

237
00:18:20,883 --> 00:18:21,765
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kidding, I don't know.

238
00:18:22,358 --> 00:18:26,023
[SPEAKER_15]: TigerClaw says, one thing's for sure, expect Rob to post nothing but kiddie pics on the Wii U.

239
00:18:37,558 --> 00:19:07,030
[SPEAKER_15]: um I would love to post a broad like I would tell if you want to follow me on uh the me-verse thing although I'm not sure what that will accomplish but I'm I'm Rob Roberts so it's all one word Rob Roberts so you can follow me or whatever and um I'll be happy to post kitty pictures publicly but I can't like it won't let me do it like I don't know like unless I go randomly reply to some community message like oh no one care about the uh Skylanders community let me just go post my kitty pics here

240
00:19:09,713 --> 00:19:13,035
[SPEAKER_15]: All the Nintendo communities in Miiverse right now are just game communities.

241
00:19:13,595 --> 00:19:15,155
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, I need a kitty community.

242
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:17,156
[SPEAKER_15]: Where's my lolcat community?

243
00:19:18,497 --> 00:19:18,817
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyhow.

244
00:19:19,757 --> 00:19:22,078
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, they don't understand online.

245
00:19:22,438 --> 00:19:24,059
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just the way it is.

246
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:26,179
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, now they have online.

247
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:29,541
[SPEAKER_13]: They have something that sort of resembles what we had last generation.

248
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,222
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, if we're going to consider this another generation.

249
00:19:32,302 --> 00:19:35,303
[SPEAKER_13]: But they just don't get it still.

250
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:36,043
[SPEAKER_13]: And...

251
00:19:37,631 --> 00:19:38,011
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

252
00:19:38,172 --> 00:19:41,455
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just... Enjoy, I guess.

253
00:19:42,196 --> 00:19:43,076
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm gonna be honest.

254
00:19:43,197 --> 00:19:44,037
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm gonna be honest.

255
00:19:44,138 --> 00:19:47,881
[SPEAKER_15]: My early thought, and keep in mind, early impressions can sometimes change.

256
00:19:48,081 --> 00:19:49,042
[SPEAKER_15]: So here's my disclaimer.

257
00:19:49,082 --> 00:19:50,184
[SPEAKER_15]: This is my early thought.

258
00:19:51,044 --> 00:19:55,489
[SPEAKER_15]: I kind of think the Wii U is not... I mean, it's not a next-gen system.

259
00:19:55,689 --> 00:19:56,089
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not.

260
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:00,514
[SPEAKER_15]: It is more the pinnacle of this generation.

261
00:20:02,003 --> 00:20:29,639
[SPEAKER_15]: I get what they're trying to do with the whole controller thing it is kind of a neat experience I'll give them that it's you know I hazed it a lot earlier on but that I'll be that that tablet is really fucking crystal clear and it does it does enhance some of the games it's pretty neat but I'm not sure like I really don't feel like I am in the next gen of gaming or this is really pushing the envelope as far as graphics and everything go no it's more like Nintendo's finally playing catch up yay they're caught up

262
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,042
[SPEAKER_15]: Until next year.

263
00:20:32,142 --> 00:20:34,425
[SPEAKER_15]: Now I get to finally play Mario in HD and so forth.

264
00:20:35,427 --> 00:20:36,949
[SPEAKER_15]: At least that's where I'm at right now.

265
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:41,876
[SPEAKER_15]: Ranma in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says Reggie said it wasn't next gen.

266
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:50,443
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know, that's a fair response, because we as gamers make all this shit a competition sometimes.

267
00:20:51,703 --> 00:20:57,386
[SPEAKER_15]: And Nintendo is trying to say, wait a minute, wait a minute, no, we're not a next gen, we're the other gen.

268
00:20:57,426 --> 00:20:59,187
[SPEAKER_15]: It was the exact same thing with the Wii.

269
00:20:59,307 --> 00:21:00,347
[SPEAKER_15]: It was the exact same thing with the Wii.

270
00:21:00,367 --> 00:21:02,728
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just an easy way to argue that your system sucks.

271
00:21:02,808 --> 00:21:03,429
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's...

272
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:04,889
[SPEAKER_13]: Hold on, though.

273
00:21:05,109 --> 00:21:06,169
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not competing with anybody.

274
00:21:06,189 --> 00:21:07,350
[SPEAKER_13]: We're in our own market.

275
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,570
[SPEAKER_13]: Therefore, we're number one.

276
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:09,690
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that's stupid.

277
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:13,491
[SPEAKER_15]: But the Wii sold more than PlayStations and Xboxes.

278
00:21:13,571 --> 00:21:14,492
[SPEAKER_15]: That is fact.

279
00:21:14,592 --> 00:21:15,632
[SPEAKER_15]: You cannot dispute that.

280
00:21:15,672 --> 00:21:18,272
[SPEAKER_15]: The Wii was the winner of those last three consoles.

281
00:21:18,312 --> 00:21:19,953
[SPEAKER_15]: Whether you like it or not, that's the way it is.

282
00:21:20,233 --> 00:21:21,873
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's because they had a great packing game.

283
00:21:21,893 --> 00:21:22,594
[SPEAKER_13]: Everyone bought it.

284
00:21:22,794 --> 00:21:24,414
[SPEAKER_16]: Not gonna happen this generation, though.

285
00:21:25,454 --> 00:21:28,515
[SPEAKER_16]: Nothing wrong with that last generation, but I think I agree with him about the Wii U.

286
00:21:29,437 --> 00:21:46,873
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think I said as much when I called after I was at the launch experience is that because of the higher tier in order to actually have a pack-in and the fact that there is not something that you just drop into, it's been forever since I played Wii Sports, you turn it on, you pick a game, and you start playing.

287
00:21:47,353 --> 00:21:53,799
[SPEAKER_16]: There are a lot more hurdles from what I've seen of the Wii U, and that's unfortunately quite detrimental to...

288
00:21:55,260 --> 00:22:23,031
[SPEAKER_13]: and the thing with the Wii is just or the Wii U is that they assume they're really targeting this at people that bought Wiis they're not targeting this at new consumers because if you're a new consumer then guess what you can't play multiplayer because you got one fucking controller and no other controllers with it you have to go buy all those $40 controllers and all the nunchucks that go along with that and all the other accessories that you need to play those games because once again they marketed this at people that own the Wii and

289
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:51,796
[SPEAKER_13]: and those people that own the Wii some of whom yes will buy the system but like you're not gonna see old folks homes or anything like that purchasing this to play Nintendo Land no one's gonna give a fuck because they're playing Wii Sports still I just you know what okay I gotta wrap up because I gotta go to the next thing because we have another big thing coming up even before gaming weeks we got another big thing and you know I seriously have nothing to say about any of this well really as a gamer you have no opinion because I don't have one probably not gonna get one mm-hmm

290
00:22:52,543 --> 00:22:53,524
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, yeah, it's nice.

291
00:22:54,064 --> 00:22:59,469
[SPEAKER_07]: I told Dan I kind of want to win, you know, but I can't talk about something that I don't own.

292
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:04,613
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's also, it's not something, and I say this to everybody, it's not something you really like have to have.

293
00:23:04,953 --> 00:23:05,173
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

294
00:23:05,714 --> 00:23:08,196
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, like, you know what I'm more excited about?

295
00:23:08,656 --> 00:23:09,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking Omega.

296
00:23:10,785 --> 00:23:11,566
[SPEAKER_15]: and that's what you're into.

297
00:23:12,226 --> 00:23:13,207
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's the thing.

298
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:16,549
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to start to wrap this up and I want to make this comment.

299
00:23:16,589 --> 00:23:21,953
[SPEAKER_15]: Despite all of that that you guys are saying with Wii U, I really think this thing is down a similar path as 3DS.

300
00:23:22,113 --> 00:23:28,518
[SPEAKER_15]: I realize 3DS to some extent is struggling as well, but I think Wii U is going to gain a lot of steam next holiday because you know

301
00:23:29,198 --> 00:23:30,619
[SPEAKER_15]: That big holiday game's coming out.

302
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,320
[SPEAKER_15]: That Zelda's coming out next Christmas.

303
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,801
[SPEAKER_15]: Or the big Metroid or something.

304
00:23:34,821 --> 00:23:36,282
[SPEAKER_15]: There will be a huge game.

305
00:23:36,802 --> 00:23:43,125
[SPEAKER_15]: And one thing Nintendo does very well, the characters in the story, love it or not, they have rabid fans.

306
00:23:43,365 --> 00:23:51,229
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's gonna sway a lot of people to picking those up even next holiday, even with new Xbox and new PlayStation possibly out on the market.

307
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:54,051
[SPEAKER_15]: And I guess this is a whole other can of worms.

308
00:23:54,211 --> 00:23:55,612
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we'll have new Xbox.

309
00:23:55,672 --> 00:23:57,913
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not so sure right now we're gonna have new PlayStation next year.

310
00:23:58,513 --> 00:24:00,954
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't see why they should be in a rush.

311
00:24:01,414 --> 00:24:03,255
[SPEAKER_16]: Why should there be a new Xbox by the same token?

312
00:24:04,156 --> 00:24:10,318
[SPEAKER_13]: Honestly, I don't think it's really going to be... They're not going to be worried about it because the longer they take on their systems, the better they're going to be.

313
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:14,821
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you think about it, if they're... Okay, let's just say this system is not next-gen.

314
00:24:14,841 --> 00:24:16,101
[SPEAKER_13]: This system is current-gen.

315
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:18,542
[SPEAKER_13]: How are you going to compete against the Xbox?

316
00:24:18,762 --> 00:24:24,105
[SPEAKER_13]: The Xbox or the PlayStation 3, for that matter, they have a huge library of games and they're probably going to be cheaper.

317
00:24:24,765 --> 00:24:27,808
[SPEAKER_13]: So, why should I... And that's the other problem, too.

318
00:24:28,028 --> 00:24:36,855
[SPEAKER_13]: I have an Xbox 360 and a PlayStation 3, and even if I just had one of those, there's no need for me to buy a Wii U unless I really want to play New Super Mario Bros.

319
00:24:36,915 --> 00:24:45,422
[SPEAKER_13]: in HD, which, you know, it's kind of like, you know, I probably would have already played it on the Wii or on the 3DS or on the DS.

320
00:24:46,482 --> 00:24:47,643
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's just not that...

321
00:24:48,664 --> 00:24:51,546
[SPEAKER_13]: No, it's just like throwing a fresh coat of paint on an old game.

322
00:24:51,826 --> 00:24:52,426
[SPEAKER_13]: It's fun.

323
00:24:53,667 --> 00:24:54,248
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, cool.

324
00:24:54,288 --> 00:24:55,468
[SPEAKER_13]: Mario games are fun.

325
00:24:55,608 --> 00:24:57,069
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can play New Super Mario Bros.

326
00:24:57,249 --> 00:24:59,451
[SPEAKER_13]: on the Wii, on the 3DS, on the DS.

327
00:25:00,051 --> 00:25:08,276
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't need to buy a brand new system for $350 plus the game to play it.

328
00:25:08,356 --> 00:25:09,137
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not worth $410. $410.

329
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:11,519
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

330
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:15,384
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a whole nother year to debate this shit until the next console comes out.

331
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:17,166
[SPEAKER_15]: I do want to transition to something else here.

332
00:25:17,206 --> 00:25:18,027
[SPEAKER_16]: Jason, final thought.

333
00:25:19,429 --> 00:25:21,852
[SPEAKER_16]: Long-term claim chowder because of his kid.

334
00:25:21,913 --> 00:25:25,818
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki's going to be surprisingly in Nintendo camp in about four years, five years.

335
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:28,413
[SPEAKER_16]: Nah, he'll train the kid to love Call of Duty.

336
00:25:29,213 --> 00:25:30,534
[SPEAKER_13]: He's not going to love Call of Duty.

337
00:25:30,894 --> 00:25:33,976
[SPEAKER_13]: He can love whatever he wants, but that still doesn't matter.

338
00:25:34,437 --> 00:25:36,438
[SPEAKER_13]: Because if he wants to play a Mario game, guess what?

339
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:37,799
[SPEAKER_13]: There's the Nintendo.

340
00:25:37,939 --> 00:25:39,100
[SPEAKER_13]: There's the Super Nintendo.

341
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,341
[SPEAKER_13]: There's the Game Boy.

342
00:25:40,381 --> 00:25:41,082
[SPEAKER_13]: There's the DS.

343
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:41,682
[SPEAKER_13]: There's the Wii.

344
00:25:41,982 --> 00:25:44,864
[SPEAKER_13]: I have plenty of Nintendo consoles to play all these stupid games.

345
00:25:45,084 --> 00:25:48,847
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't need to buy a brand new system to play New Super Mario Bros.

346
00:25:48,867 --> 00:25:49,808
[SPEAKER_13]: with fresh coat of paint.

347
00:25:50,428 --> 00:25:51,029
[SPEAKER_13]: No, forget it.

348
00:25:51,469 --> 00:25:52,690
[SPEAKER_13]: Yet you already have that many of them.

349
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:56,127
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I don't have those systems, but I have emulators.

350
00:25:56,287 --> 00:26:01,869
[SPEAKER_13]: I can emulate all those systems, and I have a Wii, which, let's see, the last time I played that Wii was a few years ago.

351
00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:06,190
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, actually, it was a couple months ago, but that was my wife playing the Wii.

352
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:17,034
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, we're going to go to a call, because we're going to go have a chat with Rama, and I believe he has a friend there with him, too, from... Hi, you there, Rama?

353
00:26:17,814 --> 00:26:18,435
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm right here.

354
00:26:18,675 --> 00:26:20,397
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, and you have a buddy with you, right?

355
00:26:20,517 --> 00:26:21,799
[SPEAKER_15]: From AJS?

356
00:26:21,859 --> 00:26:23,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, hold on for one second.

357
00:26:23,301 --> 00:26:25,263
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to bring him right in.

358
00:26:25,463 --> 00:26:26,084
[SPEAKER_04]: He's right there.

359
00:26:26,324 --> 00:26:27,325
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, hey, look at that.

360
00:26:27,425 --> 00:26:28,386
[SPEAKER_15]: Conference call on Skype.

361
00:26:28,426 --> 00:26:29,047
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, how you doing?

362
00:26:29,968 --> 00:26:31,390
[SPEAKER_15]: Doing fabulous.

363
00:26:32,972 --> 00:26:33,933
[SPEAKER_15]: Forgive me if I'm saying this wrong.

364
00:26:33,953 --> 00:26:34,393
[SPEAKER_15]: Taiki?

365
00:26:35,174 --> 00:26:35,555
[SPEAKER_15]: Taiki.

366
00:26:35,795 --> 00:26:36,896
[SPEAKER_15]: Taiki, how you doing?

367
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,330
[SPEAKER_15]: Fabulous.

368
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:38,951
[SPEAKER_15]: Fantastic.

369
00:26:39,191 --> 00:26:39,511
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome.

370
00:26:39,551 --> 00:26:41,793
[SPEAKER_15]: So you guys were at the launch event last night, right?

371
00:26:42,613 --> 00:26:43,174
[SPEAKER_15]: That's correct, sir.

372
00:26:43,674 --> 00:26:49,098
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I'm guessing all them media cameras were everywhere and it was hype, hype, hype, hype.

373
00:26:49,138 --> 00:26:49,999
[SPEAKER_15]: Was it hype, hype, hype?

374
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,260
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

375
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,362
[SPEAKER_04]: To me it was a lot of hype and a lot of the chill, chill, chill.

376
00:26:55,943 --> 00:26:56,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah?

377
00:26:57,076 --> 00:27:04,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, from what I observed, some media, but you know how media goes.

378
00:27:04,239 --> 00:27:07,340
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a little directed.

379
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:13,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo told them where to go, what to shoot, at least as far as I could tell.

380
00:27:15,524 --> 00:27:22,487
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a lot going on in the crowd, but it seemed like the media really didn't want to be there.

381
00:27:23,827 --> 00:27:26,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that's my opinion.

382
00:27:26,969 --> 00:27:32,492
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what though, from my limited time when I was studying to be originally in college, I was going to be a broadcast journalist.

383
00:27:32,572 --> 00:27:33,013
[SPEAKER_15]: Here I am.

384
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:34,914
[SPEAKER_15]: That doesn't surprise me.

385
00:27:35,074 --> 00:27:37,375
[SPEAKER_15]: They get very unenthusiastic about a lot of things.

386
00:27:37,515 --> 00:27:44,319
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's just, you know, you build up a resistance to hype, you know, but anyway.

387
00:27:44,619 --> 00:27:52,664
[SPEAKER_15]: So you guys both went as media to cover it and so forth for AJS and OLR, but did you guys walk out of there with one?

388
00:27:53,064 --> 00:27:53,224
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

389
00:27:53,264 --> 00:27:53,444
[SPEAKER_15]: Nope.

390
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:57,067
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, did they sell out that night?

391
00:28:11,517 --> 00:28:13,158
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but there was a considerable line.

392
00:28:14,098 --> 00:28:17,739
[SPEAKER_06]: After the event ended, we all went to McDonald's to get a little nosh.

393
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:24,981
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we left, heading back to the train station, we noticed that there were still about, I would say about 50 to 100 people still in line.

394
00:28:25,181 --> 00:28:25,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

395
00:28:26,882 --> 00:28:37,365
[SPEAKER_04]: And from my knowledge, the line went up until about 5 o'clock in the morning because some people on my Facebook, oh, let's just say one of my friends kind of went home dejected.

396
00:28:38,305 --> 00:28:39,165
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, ouch.

397
00:28:40,206 --> 00:28:40,946
[SPEAKER_15]: That's unfortunate.

398
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:45,461
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, well you guys are at the event and you guys got some interviews and so forth.

399
00:28:45,541 --> 00:28:47,444
[SPEAKER_15]: So we want to play those here on the show.

400
00:28:47,544 --> 00:28:49,787
[SPEAKER_15]: So tell us about what I'm playing.

401
00:28:51,089 --> 00:28:54,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the ones with the market share, that was Taiki's idea.

402
00:28:54,193 --> 00:28:55,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Taiki, you take that one.

403
00:28:56,095 --> 00:29:02,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so we were at the Duane Reade across the street from the Nintendo World Store, you know, preparing.

404
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:06,982
[SPEAKER_06]: We had about four hours to go, so I'm thinking it's time for some Red Bull.

405
00:29:07,022 --> 00:29:13,066
[SPEAKER_06]: So we leave, and I'm looking at the line, and I was thinking there's probably something interesting here.

406
00:29:13,146 --> 00:29:16,167
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, he's got a lot of people here who obviously enjoy fun.

407
00:29:17,949 --> 00:29:19,269
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's bring it down a little.

408
00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:20,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do something a little more fun.

409
00:29:22,131 --> 00:29:26,054
[SPEAKER_06]: My thought was we need to do something with these people in line.

410
00:29:26,594 --> 00:29:31,998
[SPEAKER_06]: You've seen those segments on Conan where they send someone like Triumph or whoever to the line.

411
00:29:32,198 --> 00:29:38,422
[SPEAKER_06]: I was thinking we need to do something like that but not insulting but very funny and very much inside gaming.

412
00:29:39,602 --> 00:29:46,487
[SPEAKER_06]: So my idea was let's start asking people who look like they're a little older who will know older consoles or

413
00:29:47,116 --> 00:29:55,762
[SPEAKER_06]: What will the Wii U do to the market share for, say, the Dreamcast or the Neo Geo or the Jaguar?

414
00:29:56,182 --> 00:30:03,207
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, let's check out some of these interviews with people and gauging the impact of the Wii U on the market share.

415
00:30:03,988 --> 00:30:04,828
[SPEAKER_06]: We found this man in line.

416
00:30:05,749 --> 00:30:06,329
[SPEAKER_06]: What is your name, sir?

417
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:08,751
[SPEAKER_06]: John, but you can call me the Hux.

418
00:30:09,451 --> 00:30:09,852
[SPEAKER_06]: The Hux?

419
00:30:11,473 --> 00:30:11,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

420
00:30:11,873 --> 00:30:14,275
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Wii U, what do you think?

421
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,881
[SPEAKER_21]: It looks like a very interesting console.

422
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:17,762
[SPEAKER_21]: Good innovation.

423
00:30:19,263 --> 00:30:22,925
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm really impressed with the changes they've made to the network specifically.

424
00:30:23,706 --> 00:30:25,287
[SPEAKER_21]: But some of the launch titles look good.

425
00:30:25,327 --> 00:30:26,808
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sure it's only going to go uphill from here.

426
00:30:28,309 --> 00:30:29,930
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm really impressed with the controller as well.

427
00:30:31,211 --> 00:30:36,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, and speaking of the controller, how do you think that the Wii U is going to impact the Dreamcast market share?

428
00:30:36,601 --> 00:31:01,926
[SPEAKER_21]: the Dreamcast market share Dreamcast is probably the best system, number one and all I know is, if I want to you're very brave saying that in front of the Nintendo World Store, sir hey Dreamcast go buy one buy some CD-ROMs go get a disc burner I don't know what you're going to do put some games on there, play that up this man knows what's up this man knows what's up

429
00:31:06,981 --> 00:31:07,441
[SPEAKER_06]: Your name, sir?

430
00:31:07,681 --> 00:31:07,981
[SPEAKER_22]: Jason.

431
00:31:08,521 --> 00:31:08,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Jason.

432
00:31:08,922 --> 00:31:10,342
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think of the Wii U?

433
00:31:10,682 --> 00:31:15,603
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm really excited for the Wii U. I've always been a hardcore Nintendo fan, so... What do you think of the new controller?

434
00:31:15,843 --> 00:31:16,844
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's awesome, dude.

435
00:31:17,064 --> 00:31:19,004
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's a big step forward in gaming in general.

436
00:31:19,905 --> 00:31:24,246
[SPEAKER_06]: So, what do you think that the Wii U is going to do to the TurboGrafx-16's market share?

437
00:31:26,606 --> 00:31:27,467
[SPEAKER_23]: Is that a serious question?

438
00:31:28,427 --> 00:31:28,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Dead serious.

439
00:31:30,387 --> 00:31:30,828
[SPEAKER_23]: You know what?

440
00:31:30,968 --> 00:31:32,148
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not even worried about market shares.

441
00:31:33,833 --> 00:31:36,736
[SPEAKER_06]: So, wait a minute, we got the new Mario game, how do you think that's going to compare to Bonk?

442
00:31:38,057 --> 00:31:39,378
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, Bonk has its place.

443
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:41,060
[SPEAKER_23]: You can't take that away from Bonk.

444
00:31:42,922 --> 00:31:43,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Man knows his stuff.

445
00:31:44,163 --> 00:31:44,543
[SPEAKER_23]: Let's go.

446
00:31:45,744 --> 00:31:46,345
[SPEAKER_06]: And your name, sir?

447
00:31:47,446 --> 00:31:48,867
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Plinio Busato.

448
00:31:49,828 --> 00:31:52,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, and what do you think of the Wii U?

449
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:53,532
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's going to be awesome.

450
00:31:53,692 --> 00:31:55,033
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm really excited about that.

451
00:31:55,373 --> 00:31:55,874
[SPEAKER_12]: I really am.

452
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:57,996
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think of the new controller?

453
00:31:59,297 --> 00:32:12,723
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's very innovative, it's fresh, and it's nice because after the Wii, which was very innovative and brought something new, I think this controller is a follow-up, and it's really nice.

454
00:32:12,923 --> 00:32:13,243
[SPEAKER_12]: Can't wait.

455
00:32:13,944 --> 00:32:17,085
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think that the Wii U is going to do to the Neo Geo's market share?

456
00:32:17,865 --> 00:32:18,286
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, wow.

457
00:32:18,966 --> 00:32:19,966
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have an idea.

458
00:32:20,426 --> 00:32:25,849
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope it's going to keep the leadership that the Wii brought.

459
00:32:25,869 --> 00:32:26,569
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

460
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:28,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

461
00:32:29,454 --> 00:32:30,535
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Kim.

462
00:32:31,195 --> 00:32:31,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Kim.

463
00:32:32,396 --> 00:32:33,216
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think of the Wii U?

464
00:32:33,436 --> 00:32:34,437
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's amazing.

465
00:32:34,497 --> 00:32:35,657
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait to play it.

466
00:32:35,717 --> 00:32:36,518
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so excited.

467
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,359
[SPEAKER_06]: So what do you think of the new Wii U controller?

468
00:32:39,239 --> 00:32:40,220
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually very light.

469
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,562
[SPEAKER_00]: I've played it before, so it's surprisingly light, and it's just amazing.

470
00:32:44,582 --> 00:32:45,903
[SPEAKER_00]: It brings the whole game to life.

471
00:32:46,843 --> 00:32:50,685
[SPEAKER_06]: So what do you think that the Wii U is going to do to the Sega Saturn's market share?

472
00:32:51,366 --> 00:32:52,046
[SPEAKER_00]: Sega Saturn?

473
00:32:52,587 --> 00:32:53,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Sega Saturn.

474
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:58,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Panzer Dragoon, Virtua Fighter.

475
00:33:01,904 --> 00:33:02,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Your name, sir?

476
00:33:02,645 --> 00:33:03,245
[SPEAKER_01]: Carlos Rivera.

477
00:33:03,705 --> 00:33:05,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Carlos, what do you think of the Wii U?

478
00:33:05,947 --> 00:33:07,148
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm very excited about it.

479
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:12,672
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been reading up on it since they announced it was going to come out, and that's why I'm here now, to get it.

480
00:33:12,692 --> 00:33:13,813
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent, excellent.

481
00:33:13,873 --> 00:33:14,894
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think of the new controller?

482
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:16,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I love the tablet controller.

483
00:33:16,576 --> 00:33:18,977
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the fact that it's a tablet.

484
00:33:19,057 --> 00:33:22,660
[SPEAKER_01]: You can play the games on it, other than your screen.

485
00:33:23,061 --> 00:33:23,441
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.

486
00:33:24,506 --> 00:33:27,309
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think this is going to do to the Atari Jaguar's market share?

487
00:33:27,709 --> 00:33:31,573
[SPEAKER_06]: The Atari Jaguar has that 16, that numpad button controller.

488
00:33:32,754 --> 00:33:35,317
[SPEAKER_01]: Well... That was pretty innovative.

489
00:33:35,837 --> 00:33:40,702
[SPEAKER_01]: It was pretty innovative, but I, I mean, you know, I'm going to be looking into that too, of course.

490
00:33:41,511 --> 00:33:42,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent, excellent.

491
00:33:42,872 --> 00:33:46,935
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you think maybe that girl might have known what an N-Gage was?

492
00:33:47,016 --> 00:33:48,717
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe she should have checked on that market share.

493
00:33:48,757 --> 00:33:49,137
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

494
00:33:49,237 --> 00:33:51,199
[SPEAKER_15]: She's like, what's a Sega Saturn?

495
00:33:51,239 --> 00:33:51,679
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

496
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,061
[SPEAKER_10]: That just makes me hurt in my heart.

497
00:33:56,283 --> 00:33:58,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Please, no one remember what the N-Gage was.

498
00:33:58,485 --> 00:34:02,868
[SPEAKER_15]: I love the people in the background going, Sega Saturn?

499
00:34:02,928 --> 00:34:04,029
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not in this.

500
00:34:04,109 --> 00:34:06,131
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to have an N-Gage.

501
00:34:06,869 --> 00:34:07,470
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I know.

502
00:34:07,911 --> 00:34:08,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we gave it away.

503
00:34:10,775 --> 00:34:19,968
[SPEAKER_15]: So, Loki, I thought I saw you kind of twitching over there a little bit when they were asking about the tablets and some of the people were like kind of giving the same answer.

504
00:34:20,048 --> 00:34:22,692
[SPEAKER_15]: So innovative, so different, so new, so fresh.

505
00:34:23,032 --> 00:34:24,633
[SPEAKER_13]: That's no, that's not an answer.

506
00:34:24,673 --> 00:34:25,874
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just like a canned answer.

507
00:34:26,534 --> 00:34:27,855
[SPEAKER_13]: That is literally right there.

508
00:34:27,915 --> 00:34:29,176
[SPEAKER_13]: That is subliminal advertising.

509
00:34:29,216 --> 00:34:34,218
[SPEAKER_13]: That's from basically, they keep hearing it repeated to them that this is so innovative and stuff.

510
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:38,141
[SPEAKER_13]: And then they go and say, oh yeah, it's so innovative.

511
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,221
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what they tell their friends.

512
00:34:39,521 --> 00:34:42,123
[SPEAKER_13]: What is so fucking innovative about this tablet?

513
00:34:42,303 --> 00:34:45,265
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, it's a tablet that exists pretty much on everything right now.

514
00:34:45,285 --> 00:34:47,146
[SPEAKER_15]: It is a shit ton better than smart glass, I'll tell you that.

515
00:34:47,646 --> 00:34:51,809
[SPEAKER_15]: I said smart glasses, nothing more than a fancy Wi-Fi remote for the 360, that's all it is

516
00:35:14,188 --> 00:35:34,421
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, well, before we get into that So, the tablet's all it is is on live for the Wii Fair enough Well, not really, I mean, the big difference that you'll see with the Wii I think it's a huge difference too, but anyway It's just low latency, that's all It's latency, it's low latency Anyhow, alright, let's talk about some of these other interviews Who else did you talk to while you were there at the show?

517
00:35:35,305 --> 00:35:51,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, while we were discussing the whole market share quip, we came across this one guy named Nick who does charity for one of his closest friends because they were on the line for the Wii, but unfortunately his friend passed away from leukemia, so they do a chocolate charity in his honor every year.

518
00:35:51,969 --> 00:35:52,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's cool.

519
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:53,990
[SPEAKER_15]: I like that.

520
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:54,730
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's hear from this guy.

521
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:55,950
[SPEAKER_06]: We found this man.

522
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:56,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Your name again, sir?

523
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,031
[SPEAKER_20]: My name is James Brief.

524
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:05,006
[SPEAKER_06]: James, do you have any particular connection to the Wii and Wii launch dates?

525
00:36:06,047 --> 00:36:17,297
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, actually, my friends and I, years ago, were in the same line waiting for the Wii, and one of our friends, Nicholas Capobianco, since then, he passed away from leukemia.

526
00:36:18,478 --> 00:36:31,785
[SPEAKER_20]: and every year since then, our friends, we get together like we did in the old days and we have a gaming marathon where we play games weekend straight, stream it live on the net at nixmarathon.org and we raise money for a child's play.

527
00:36:32,285 --> 00:36:35,827
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a charity that raises money for pediatric hospitals.

528
00:36:36,407 --> 00:36:36,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

529
00:36:36,947 --> 00:36:41,329
[SPEAKER_06]: Very reminiscent of Loading Ready Run's Desert Bus for Hope.

530
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,050
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that's very cool.

531
00:36:43,891 --> 00:36:44,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

532
00:36:44,787 --> 00:36:46,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any other comments about the Wii U?

533
00:36:47,268 --> 00:36:48,269
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, looking forward to it.

534
00:36:48,729 --> 00:36:51,330
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think this is going to do to the GameCube's market share?

535
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,112
[SPEAKER_20]: I think connectivity is on its way back.

536
00:36:54,672 --> 00:36:55,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Fabulous.

537
00:36:56,152 --> 00:36:57,573
[SPEAKER_15]: The connectivity is on its way back.

538
00:36:57,793 --> 00:36:59,254
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that's a very noble cause.

539
00:36:59,354 --> 00:37:00,435
[SPEAKER_15]: That's actually really awesome.

540
00:37:00,575 --> 00:37:02,556
[SPEAKER_15]: So props to that guy.

541
00:37:02,576 --> 00:37:03,096
[SPEAKER_15]: That's great.

542
00:37:03,176 --> 00:37:04,416
[SPEAKER_15]: And the group of friends that do that.

543
00:37:04,477 --> 00:37:08,659
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope if I inevitably leave this world too soon, y'all will do something similar.

544
00:37:08,699 --> 00:37:09,299
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's great.

545
00:37:09,983 --> 00:37:11,164
[SPEAKER_04]: You know we will because we love you.

546
00:37:11,284 --> 00:37:14,446
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll totally start a charity to get me game systems.

547
00:37:15,206 --> 00:37:15,607
[SPEAKER_13]: Stop.

548
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:16,187
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

549
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:18,008
[SPEAKER_15]: Moving on.

550
00:37:18,529 --> 00:37:20,110
[SPEAKER_15]: Who else did you guys talk to?

551
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the next clip I called Wii U Gets Grilled Cheese Sandwiches.

552
00:37:25,213 --> 00:37:30,316
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems that the staff was handing out drinks, food, to everybody that's online.

553
00:37:30,516 --> 00:37:37,541
[SPEAKER_04]: So as we were interviewing this one parent that's on the line for Wii U, staffer comes by, hands us grilled cheese sandwiches.

554
00:37:37,721 --> 00:37:38,561
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're like, why not?

555
00:37:38,581 --> 00:37:39,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's roll with it.

556
00:37:39,949 --> 00:37:40,890
[SPEAKER_15]: Heck yeah, let's hear this.

557
00:37:41,912 --> 00:37:43,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, DJ Ranma S here.

558
00:37:43,374 --> 00:37:49,943
[SPEAKER_04]: We are live, well, sort of live, outside of Nintendo World with the thousands and thousands of the Nintendo's fans.

559
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:52,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you hear that?

560
00:37:52,651 --> 00:37:55,272
[SPEAKER_04]: These people are psyched for a Wii U and you know what?

561
00:37:56,453 --> 00:37:58,614
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wii U makes some real good grilled cheese sandwiches.

562
00:37:58,634 --> 00:37:59,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.

563
00:37:59,354 --> 00:37:59,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.

564
00:38:00,455 --> 00:38:00,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that.

565
00:38:01,315 --> 00:38:04,277
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wii U makes really good grilled cheese sandwiches.

566
00:38:04,297 --> 00:38:07,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Something that the PS3 could not do, that damn George Foreman grill.

567
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:13,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, we're talking to some people out here about their thoughts about the Wii U and how long have you been on the line for this console?

568
00:38:14,523 --> 00:38:16,144
[SPEAKER_09]: Since about 2 o'clock this afternoon.

569
00:38:16,764 --> 00:38:20,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, so you decided not to come out here on a Monday or Tuesday and be like, I'm number one?

570
00:38:20,326 --> 00:38:25,128
[SPEAKER_09]: I did have to work, but somebody has to pay for the Wii U. True, but do you have kids?

571
00:38:25,348 --> 00:38:25,548
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

572
00:38:26,489 --> 00:38:28,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you think about sending the kids out here to hold the spot?

573
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:30,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody has to go to school.

574
00:38:31,011 --> 00:38:32,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there's a will, there is a way.

575
00:38:32,732 --> 00:38:36,614
[SPEAKER_04]: So tell me, is this the first time you are online for a game or a console like this?

576
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:36,934
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

577
00:38:37,614 --> 00:38:38,835
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are you out here for this?

578
00:38:39,175 --> 00:38:39,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Right here.

579
00:38:40,536 --> 00:38:42,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I just wanted to see how crowded it would be.

580
00:38:44,058 --> 00:38:44,638
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can...

581
00:38:46,656 --> 00:38:48,778
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you can see, it is very crowded.

582
00:38:48,798 --> 00:38:50,339
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a thinned out version.

583
00:38:50,659 --> 00:38:53,641
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you know, Christmas is right around the corner.

584
00:38:53,721 --> 00:38:58,345
[SPEAKER_04]: So how much pressure are you under to get this console under the tree?

585
00:38:58,905 --> 00:38:59,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, a lot of pressure.

586
00:39:00,206 --> 00:39:00,846
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of pressure.

587
00:39:00,886 --> 00:39:02,508
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm always under pressure every Christmas.

588
00:39:02,728 --> 00:39:03,769
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd set it up today.

589
00:39:04,629 --> 00:39:05,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Today?

590
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:07,611
Yeah, I don't care if I get back at like midnight.

591
00:39:07,631 --> 00:39:08,272
I don't care.

592
00:39:08,852 --> 00:39:10,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I remember when the Super Nintendo came out.

593
00:39:11,294 --> 00:39:14,917
[SPEAKER_04]: I played it and I was told, pack it up, put it back in the box and put it back under the tree.

594
00:39:15,097 --> 00:39:16,098
[SPEAKER_09]: It would go back under the tree.

595
00:39:17,881 --> 00:39:20,782
[SPEAKER_04]: What have you just wrapped the empty... There you go!

596
00:39:21,122 --> 00:39:23,622
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you thought about just wrapping just the empty box under the tree?

597
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:25,023
[SPEAKER_02]: It could work.

598
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:29,364
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would be a good thing, so what games are you planning on getting out of here with?

599
00:39:29,744 --> 00:39:31,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, just Nintendo Land.

600
00:39:31,084 --> 00:39:34,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm waiting for some of the other games to come out towards the end of this year.

601
00:39:35,085 --> 00:39:36,626
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to buy a new Super Mario Bros.

602
00:39:36,906 --> 00:39:39,447
[SPEAKER_02]: 2, Zombie U, maybe a little later after launch.

603
00:39:40,467 --> 00:39:42,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, that sounds like a plan, so thanks a lot for your time!

604
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:44,108
Arigato gozaimasu!

605
00:39:44,288 --> 00:39:44,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Datashimashite!

606
00:39:45,515 --> 00:39:47,156
[SPEAKER_15]: I was a very excited family.

607
00:39:48,577 --> 00:39:49,378
[SPEAKER_15]: Did I hear her right?

608
00:39:49,418 --> 00:39:50,879
[SPEAKER_15]: They set up the tree already?

609
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,541
[SPEAKER_04]: The tree is set up around the corner.

610
00:39:53,561 --> 00:39:56,243
[SPEAKER_04]: The lighting ceremony is like sometime this or next week.

611
00:39:56,263 --> 00:39:57,744
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, the Rockefeller tree.

612
00:39:57,944 --> 00:39:58,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, right, right.

613
00:39:58,825 --> 00:39:59,345
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

614
00:39:59,365 --> 00:40:00,946
[SPEAKER_15]: They usually do that over the Thanksgiving weekend.

615
00:40:00,986 --> 00:40:01,707
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, I gotcha.

616
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:02,287
[SPEAKER_15]: I gotcha.

617
00:40:02,607 --> 00:40:03,808
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, so what's this next one you got?

618
00:40:04,529 --> 00:40:11,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Link was online, so I had to ask him what his thoughts were, and did Zelda know that he left the castle?

619
00:40:13,004 --> 00:40:17,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, DJ Ranma S here at Rockefeller Center right in front of Nintendo World.

620
00:40:18,725 --> 00:40:19,406
[SPEAKER_04]: Take a look at that.

621
00:40:19,546 --> 00:40:21,066
[SPEAKER_04]: That is an awesome view, ain't it?

622
00:40:22,726 --> 00:40:23,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.

623
00:40:23,787 --> 00:40:24,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Beautiful.

624
00:40:24,627 --> 00:40:26,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Right here, I'm chilling out with Link from Hyrule.

625
00:40:27,147 --> 00:40:28,108
[SPEAKER_19]: Link, what's going on, brother?

626
00:40:28,368 --> 00:40:34,149
[SPEAKER_19]: Just hanging out with my fellow diehard Nintendo fans and enjoying the night and having a good time.

627
00:40:34,649 --> 00:40:36,570
[SPEAKER_19]: So what brings you here tonight, good friend?

628
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:37,990
[SPEAKER_19]: Wii U, obviously.

629
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:41,131
[SPEAKER_19]: What about the Wii U that you want so bad?

630
00:40:41,974 --> 00:40:43,895
[SPEAKER_19]: because Nintendo, man.

631
00:40:44,115 --> 00:40:45,396
[SPEAKER_19]: That's all I got to say.

632
00:40:45,416 --> 00:40:46,476
[SPEAKER_19]: Nintendo's the short answer.

633
00:40:46,857 --> 00:40:52,860
[SPEAKER_19]: The long answer is I'm really excited about the new innovation that Nintendo's brought out with the new tablet controller.

634
00:40:54,521 --> 00:40:58,783
[SPEAKER_19]: They always set the bar with everything that they do, every generation.

635
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:06,827
[SPEAKER_19]: They were the first for the joystick, the first for the shoulder buttons, the first for the rumble feature, the first for the motion, now they're the first for the touchscreen controller.

636
00:41:08,028 --> 00:41:09,749
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's just what they do, and they do it best.

637
00:41:10,762 --> 00:41:13,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, this brother, he's die hard, really die hard.

638
00:41:13,784 --> 00:41:22,489
[SPEAKER_04]: So Link, let me ask you, if you're here online for the Wii U, who's watching Zelda?

639
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:25,110
[SPEAKER_19]: That's an excellent question.

640
00:41:26,311 --> 00:41:29,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing, does she even know that you left the castle to be here?

641
00:41:29,393 --> 00:41:31,594
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I snuck out for a couple days, actually, yeah.

642
00:41:33,526 --> 00:41:38,467
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I hope that Ganon doesn't try to roll up on your property, man.

643
00:41:38,487 --> 00:41:40,348
[SPEAKER_19]: She has Sheik watching her, so she'll be alright.

644
00:41:41,068 --> 00:41:42,788
[SPEAKER_19]: Sheik's a tough mother, you know.

645
00:41:44,328 --> 00:41:46,649
[SPEAKER_19]: So, Sheik is watching Zelda.

646
00:41:46,669 --> 00:41:47,369
[SPEAKER_19]: Not Sheik, I'm sorry.

647
00:41:47,789 --> 00:41:48,049
[SPEAKER_19]: Impa.

648
00:41:48,209 --> 00:41:50,590
[SPEAKER_19]: Zelda is Sheik.

649
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:51,190
[SPEAKER_19]: I made a mistake.

650
00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:52,410
[SPEAKER_19]: Impa's watching.

651
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:54,771
[SPEAKER_04]: An old woman is watching Zelda.

652
00:41:55,191 --> 00:41:56,111
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, she's a Sheikah.

653
00:41:58,356 --> 00:42:01,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you can't beat that kind of logic, so thank you, good sir.

654
00:42:01,224 --> 00:42:01,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

655
00:42:02,347 --> 00:42:03,109
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much.

656
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:03,891
[SPEAKER_19]: No problem.

657
00:42:04,537 --> 00:42:10,040
[SPEAKER_15]: So Loki, I know that guy, you know, at first I was like, oh, he's just another kind of blind Nintendo fanboy.

658
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,701
[SPEAKER_15]: However, he made a pretty damn good point.

659
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:15,862
[SPEAKER_15]: Nintendo tends to set the bar with a lot of their shit.

660
00:42:16,223 --> 00:42:17,823
[SPEAKER_15]: I know you were sitting there going joystick.

661
00:42:17,863 --> 00:42:19,924
[SPEAKER_15]: They didn't do the joystick, but they did.

662
00:42:20,245 --> 00:42:23,466
[SPEAKER_15]: You can say that Nintendo set the bar for the modern gamepad.

663
00:42:23,866 --> 00:42:25,987
[SPEAKER_15]: The Kinect would have never happened if it wasn't for the Wii.

664
00:42:26,467 --> 00:42:26,808
[SPEAKER_15]: Thoughts?

665
00:42:27,789 --> 00:42:28,892
[SPEAKER_13]: The Kinect would have happened.

666
00:42:29,535 --> 00:42:31,200
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's camera technology.

667
00:42:31,521 --> 00:42:34,331
[SPEAKER_13]: The Kinect wouldn't have happened if the eye toy hadn't happened.

668
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:38,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I just think that they should have stuck with the Coleco's model.

669
00:42:40,564 --> 00:42:43,266
[SPEAKER_15]: I miss my Intellivision pad.

670
00:42:43,566 --> 00:42:47,929
[SPEAKER_15]: Is the Coleco the one where you put the plastic stuff on the TV?

671
00:42:48,049 --> 00:42:49,089
[SPEAKER_15]: Or is it the Fairchild?

672
00:42:49,109 --> 00:42:50,430
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you didn't put it on the TV.

673
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:52,211
[SPEAKER_07]: You slid a little thing into the number pad.

674
00:42:52,591 --> 00:42:55,053
[SPEAKER_15]: What was the thing that you would actually have to put the overlays on the television?

675
00:42:55,153 --> 00:42:56,514
[SPEAKER_15]: Was that the Fairchild?

676
00:42:56,594 --> 00:42:57,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Odyssey.

677
00:42:57,294 --> 00:42:57,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

678
00:42:58,255 --> 00:43:04,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know, actually the Odyssey 2, though, didn't have... I had a couple games that used that, but not many that did.

679
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:05,159
[SPEAKER_15]: I like Odyssey, too.

680
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:35,210
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I was.

681
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:37,091
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, so this is Mario and Black Luigi.

682
00:43:37,131 --> 00:43:37,471
[SPEAKER_15]: Here we go.

683
00:43:38,472 --> 00:43:39,472
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm doing a commentary.

684
00:43:39,632 --> 00:43:40,553
[SPEAKER_08]: What are you doing, Luigi?

685
00:43:41,313 --> 00:43:42,633
[SPEAKER_08]: I was also doing the commentary.

686
00:43:42,894 --> 00:43:43,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Why are you not in your mansion?

687
00:43:43,994 --> 00:43:45,655
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to get scared by the ghosts.

688
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:49,136
[SPEAKER_08]: You should be off chasing after Peach again.

689
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:50,057
[SPEAKER_08]: I need a break.

690
00:43:50,197 --> 00:43:51,297
[SPEAKER_08]: I always chase after Peach.

691
00:43:51,457 --> 00:43:52,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Peach never gives me nothing.

692
00:43:53,098 --> 00:43:53,758
[SPEAKER_08]: I need a break.

693
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:55,899
[SPEAKER_08]: So is that why she ran off with Bowser again?

694
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't you go screwing this thing over.

695
00:43:59,421 --> 00:44:00,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Bowser will take her.

696
00:44:00,661 --> 00:44:01,522
[SPEAKER_08]: She won't take Bowser.

697
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,301
[SPEAKER_08]: So how's that the my fault?

698
00:44:04,501 --> 00:44:05,341
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not the other fault.

699
00:44:05,361 --> 00:44:07,522
[SPEAKER_08]: You get out of here.

700
00:44:07,803 --> 00:44:08,283
[SPEAKER_10]: Aww.

701
00:44:10,284 --> 00:44:12,926
[SPEAKER_15]: Ranma, you know I love you, but you're the biggest goddamn nerd.

702
00:44:13,706 --> 00:44:13,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

703
00:44:14,226 --> 00:44:14,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I know.

704
00:44:15,347 --> 00:44:15,587
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

705
00:44:16,027 --> 00:44:16,348
[SPEAKER_04]: You too.

706
00:44:16,668 --> 00:44:17,748
[SPEAKER_04]: What's this next one?

707
00:44:18,829 --> 00:44:25,233
[SPEAKER_04]: This one was Taiki's idea of talking to Mario about the financial crisis in the Mushroom Kingdom.

708
00:44:25,733 --> 00:44:25,853
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

709
00:44:27,034 --> 00:44:29,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Is the Mushroom Kingdom about to go off a fiscal cliff?

710
00:44:44,116 --> 00:44:44,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Who knows?

711
00:44:44,877 --> 00:44:48,941
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's hear it.

712
00:44:49,001 --> 00:44:51,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sorry, I was playing the interview over you.

713
00:44:51,463 --> 00:44:51,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.

714
00:44:52,984 --> 00:44:55,827
[SPEAKER_06]: With the funny physics in the Mushroom Kingdom, I don't know if that's possible.

715
00:44:56,888 --> 00:44:57,869
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's hear the clip.

716
00:44:59,372 --> 00:45:00,733
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Taiki with the voice of Greeks.

717
00:45:02,774 --> 00:45:06,055
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is for a special report, the financial crisis in the Mushroom Kingdom.

718
00:45:06,655 --> 00:45:07,356
[SPEAKER_06]: I have Mario here.

719
00:45:07,816 --> 00:45:10,637
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario, I've been told you've been tasked to collect a million coins.

720
00:45:11,657 --> 00:45:14,899
[SPEAKER_06]: What are your thoughts on the current financial status in the Mushroom Kingdom?

721
00:45:15,393 --> 00:45:19,376
[SPEAKER_08]: So the rumors that they are foreclosing on the castle at the Mushroom Kingdom is true.

722
00:45:44,506 --> 00:45:45,187
[SPEAKER_08]: What rumors?

723
00:45:45,447 --> 00:45:46,187
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't hear nothing.

724
00:45:46,307 --> 00:45:47,128
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just at the beach.

725
00:45:47,929 --> 00:45:48,969
[SPEAKER_06]: Sir, you're avoiding the question.

726
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:50,210
[SPEAKER_08]: What question?

727
00:45:51,711 --> 00:45:52,972
[SPEAKER_08]: You look a lot like a Koopa.

728
00:45:53,873 --> 00:45:55,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Want I to stop you?

729
00:45:55,834 --> 00:45:57,055
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm just asking questions, sir.

730
00:45:57,936 --> 00:45:58,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Just asking questions.

731
00:45:59,077 --> 00:46:05,141
[SPEAKER_06]: So what are your thoughts on the overabundance of stars and how that's affected the stock market?

732
00:46:06,602 --> 00:46:07,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Overabundance of stars?

733
00:46:08,404 --> 00:46:09,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Make Mario invincible?

734
00:46:10,025 --> 00:46:10,946
[SPEAKER_08]: Invincible Mario kick ass?

735
00:46:15,602 --> 00:46:17,663
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a massive price crash on stars.

736
00:46:19,804 --> 00:46:20,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I see, I see.

737
00:46:22,104 --> 00:46:23,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Mario doesn't understand economics, does he?

738
00:46:24,205 --> 00:46:25,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Not very much, no.

739
00:46:26,306 --> 00:46:28,926
[SPEAKER_08]: I kick, I stomp on the goombas, I kick at the koopas.

740
00:46:29,346 --> 00:46:33,307
[SPEAKER_08]: I beat at the buzzer, I collect the coins, I no get a nothing from a peach.

741
00:46:34,528 --> 00:46:35,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Not even cake?

742
00:46:35,568 --> 00:46:36,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Not even cake.

743
00:46:37,609 --> 00:46:38,409
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, woe is on me.

744
00:46:39,918 --> 00:46:44,000
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was Taiki, Voice of Geeks Network, signing off.

745
00:47:04,624 --> 00:47:09,566
[SPEAKER_15]: So did you guys get on some of the news stations dressed up or what?

746
00:47:09,706 --> 00:47:10,147
[SPEAKER_15]: What happened?

747
00:47:11,447 --> 00:47:16,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Me, not really because the only people I saw there was people from Nintendo.

748
00:47:16,129 --> 00:47:16,849
[SPEAKER_04]: That was just about it.

749
00:47:16,889 --> 00:47:21,971
[SPEAKER_04]: But there was photographers and someone from Weekly Famitsu took my picture.

750
00:47:22,532 --> 00:47:22,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hey.

751
00:47:23,212 --> 00:47:23,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.

752
00:47:24,252 --> 00:47:25,513
[SPEAKER_04]: And Mashable was there as well.

753
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:26,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Yomiuri Shimbun

754
00:47:45,585 --> 00:47:52,467
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess it tends to happen more with Nintendo than it does the other companies because it seems like PlayStation and Vita and all that were out way earlier.

755
00:47:52,527 --> 00:47:55,087
[SPEAKER_13]: I know the Xbox is always coming out earlier over in Japan.

756
00:47:55,107 --> 00:47:57,248
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, Xbox makes a stud in Japan.

757
00:47:57,288 --> 00:47:57,548
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

758
00:47:57,808 --> 00:47:59,668
[SPEAKER_13]: Just they don't sell one for a few months.

759
00:47:59,688 --> 00:48:00,408
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, whatever.

760
00:48:00,488 --> 00:48:00,788
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

761
00:48:00,868 --> 00:48:04,909
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's get these last two interviews are some big ones.

762
00:48:05,169 --> 00:48:07,170
[SPEAKER_15]: So set this one up for us, Ranma.

763
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:07,850
[SPEAKER_15]: What's next for us?

764
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:20,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, at the front of the line was Triforce who says he was there on the line for about a month and he has some bit of surprising news to let the fans know about him doing console launches.

765
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:22,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, okay, let's hear it.

766
00:48:23,959 --> 00:48:34,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, DJ Ranma S here in front of Nintendo World USA where in just mere hours the new Wii U is going to hit the store shelves and take names and kick a lot of butt.

767
00:48:34,341 --> 00:48:37,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Now as you can see behind me, there are diehard fans out here.

768
00:48:38,302 --> 00:48:39,782
[SPEAKER_04]: How diehard are you guys?

769
00:48:42,443 --> 00:48:43,483
[SPEAKER_04]: How long y'all been out here?

770
00:48:45,484 --> 00:48:51,105
[SPEAKER_04]: As you can see, but through the maze and through the vines, we're here with the one, the only, Triforce.

771
00:48:51,305 --> 00:48:52,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Good to meet you, sir.

772
00:48:52,998 --> 00:48:53,558
[SPEAKER_18]: What's going on guys?

773
00:48:54,038 --> 00:48:57,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Not much, we're doing what we gotta do, so tell me, how long have you been waiting out here?

774
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:00,380
[SPEAKER_18]: Almost a month since March 23rd.

775
00:49:02,421 --> 00:49:07,482
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm dead serious, since March 23rd.

776
00:49:07,522 --> 00:49:09,883
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm still thinking about the 3DS since October 23rd.

777
00:49:11,703 --> 00:49:13,904
[SPEAKER_04]: October 23rd, now that's hard, that's dedication.

778
00:49:15,664 --> 00:49:17,285
[SPEAKER_04]: I tip my hat to you good sir.

779
00:49:18,655 --> 00:49:23,179
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I do recall that you were somewhere else for the Wii, is that correct?

780
00:49:23,459 --> 00:49:26,562
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, it was Toys R Us, and that was back in November.

781
00:49:26,762 --> 00:49:27,603
[SPEAKER_18]: I can remember that date.

782
00:49:28,143 --> 00:49:29,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, we all remember that.

783
00:49:29,465 --> 00:49:32,387
[SPEAKER_04]: So, why here instead of there?

784
00:49:32,627 --> 00:49:43,457
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought, well, first of all, this is my last launch that I'm going to be doing, and I took a guess, I did some investigating, and I just felt that they were going to do the launch here.

785
00:49:44,321 --> 00:49:46,203
[SPEAKER_04]: See, that's where it is, because you know what?

786
00:49:46,504 --> 00:49:52,051
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked to people about the Wii, and I kept telling everyone, Nintendo World is the jump-off spot, because this is where the party is at.

787
00:49:52,331 --> 00:49:54,934
[SPEAKER_04]: So, how many of these launch events have you done?

788
00:49:55,315 --> 00:49:56,957
[SPEAKER_18]: This is my eighth and final one.

789
00:49:57,698 --> 00:49:59,040
[SPEAKER_18]: Why is it your final one, good sir?

790
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:07,842
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to go and try to do some type of other marketing in the gaming community from the urban market, from the grassroots side.

791
00:50:08,442 --> 00:50:14,023
[SPEAKER_18]: Although I do a lot of this, I want to leave this for somebody else to do while I can help out elsewhere.

792
00:50:14,643 --> 00:50:21,065
[SPEAKER_18]: I've done enough of it, and I'm 35 years old, so now's the time to stop.

793
00:50:21,345 --> 00:50:26,146
[SPEAKER_18]: That's not to say that I won't be at other launch parties, but the whole camping for the first, I'm going to stop it.

794
00:50:26,186 --> 00:50:26,606
[SPEAKER_18]: This is it.

795
00:50:27,276 --> 00:50:33,398
[SPEAKER_04]: So in other words, after this, you're going to take, someone else is going to inherit the Power Glove, but you now have the power.

796
00:50:33,418 --> 00:50:34,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they're going to have to fight you for it.

797
00:50:35,159 --> 00:50:36,440
[SPEAKER_18]: No, they're not getting that.

798
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:38,160
[SPEAKER_18]: They're just going to have to line up.

799
00:50:38,901 --> 00:50:39,821
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm keeping the Power Glove.

800
00:50:40,421 --> 00:50:43,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Between you and me, I'd stomp somebody out for that to keep my Power Glove.

801
00:50:44,003 --> 00:50:45,503
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, that may happen, yeah.

802
00:50:45,723 --> 00:50:47,444
[SPEAKER_18]: So what was your first launch?

803
00:50:48,444 --> 00:50:49,585
[SPEAKER_18]: The Nintendo DS.

804
00:50:50,458 --> 00:50:52,780
[SPEAKER_18]: And how was that compared to the launch for the Wii U?

805
00:50:53,101 --> 00:50:55,183
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, each year Nintendo gets better with the launch.

806
00:50:55,203 --> 00:50:56,924
[SPEAKER_18]: That was all the way back in 2004.

807
00:50:57,285 --> 00:51:00,989
[SPEAKER_18]: And that was the first launch that I got first in.

808
00:51:01,049 --> 00:51:03,992
[SPEAKER_18]: My first ever launch was a Nintendo 64.

809
00:51:05,053 --> 00:51:09,017
[SPEAKER_18]: I wasn't first in line, but that's what made me get into the whole launch thing.

810
00:51:09,437 --> 00:51:11,659
[SPEAKER_18]: Then after that, some unmentionables.

811
00:51:11,699 --> 00:51:14,182
[SPEAKER_18]: I won't mention the name of the other competitors.

812
00:51:14,682 --> 00:51:16,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, those guys.

813
00:51:16,583 --> 00:51:18,064
[SPEAKER_18]: Those guys, yeah.

814
00:51:18,104 --> 00:51:21,486
[SPEAKER_18]: That's because I was working for GameStop, so I had to work the launch party.

815
00:51:21,886 --> 00:51:22,926
[SPEAKER_18]: So it wasn't as fun?

816
00:51:23,827 --> 00:51:25,608
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I wouldn't say it wasn't as fun.

817
00:51:25,988 --> 00:51:27,669
[SPEAKER_18]: I wasn't in the line for the launch.

818
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:29,249
[SPEAKER_18]: I just worked the launch party.

819
00:51:29,830 --> 00:51:33,992
[SPEAKER_18]: And then the first launch party I became first for was the Nintendo DS.

820
00:51:35,339 --> 00:51:36,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

821
00:52:02,344 --> 00:52:03,385
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

822
00:52:20,451 --> 00:52:36,781
[SPEAKER_15]: it's like that line from Lethal Weapon I'm getting too old for this shit alright we got one more interview from the event and dare I say it's a Orange Lounge Radio VOG Network exclusive we're about to get

823
00:52:37,581 --> 00:52:48,608
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, and I've been teasing a little bit on Twitter that you had a pretty big interview, but it's short, but we wanted this to be special for the fans that actually bothered to tune in and listen tonight.

824
00:52:49,108 --> 00:52:50,829
[SPEAKER_15]: Ranma, please set up this last interview.

825
00:52:51,849 --> 00:52:54,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the man...

826
00:52:55,908 --> 00:52:59,069
[SPEAKER_04]: shows up, and we all know who the man is, Reggie.

827
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:04,171
[SPEAKER_04]: He's going through the crowd, doing autographs, and saying hi to everyone.

828
00:53:04,612 --> 00:53:10,454
[SPEAKER_04]: And we catch him right before he goes inside Nintendo World, and me and Taiki ask him a couple of quick questions.

829
00:53:11,767 --> 00:53:14,509
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, you're going to have to set up the clip a little longer than that.

830
00:53:14,549 --> 00:53:17,151
[SPEAKER_15]: The live listeners literally just got dropped.

831
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:20,253
[SPEAKER_15]: Word must have gone up.

832
00:53:20,273 --> 00:53:24,836
[SPEAKER_15]: But see, yes, Ranma, you're always the first to complain about the live stream going down.

833
00:53:24,876 --> 00:53:26,798
[SPEAKER_15]: And yet here we are still talking to each other.

834
00:53:26,898 --> 00:53:27,498
[SPEAKER_15]: Isn't that funny?

835
00:53:28,339 --> 00:53:28,999
[SPEAKER_15]: I know.

836
00:53:30,761 --> 00:53:31,061
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

837
00:53:31,261 --> 00:53:31,461
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

838
00:53:31,501 --> 00:53:36,805
[SPEAKER_15]: With the apologies to the podcast listeners who are hearing this for the second time, Ranma, go ahead and set it up one more time.

839
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:38,768
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

840
00:53:57,998 --> 00:54:00,779
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, this is going to be really awkward, but the stream just went down again.

841
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:05,081
[SPEAKER_15]: We were up for like two seconds, and then it went down.

842
00:54:05,501 --> 00:54:07,982
[SPEAKER_15]: I need you guys to kill all excess internet activity.

843
00:54:08,142 --> 00:54:08,882
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not doing anything.

844
00:54:08,942 --> 00:54:10,883
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just saying I need everybody across the board.

845
00:54:11,163 --> 00:54:15,665
[SPEAKER_15]: Any chat, I need it all closed, because this is killing the show with all these computers running.

846
00:54:16,185 --> 00:54:17,125
[SPEAKER_15]: So, all right.

847
00:54:17,185 --> 00:54:18,386
[SPEAKER_15]: Even my torrents of Shiza porn?

848
00:54:19,847 --> 00:54:21,227
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, any torrents of that stuff.

849
00:54:21,328 --> 00:54:23,529
[SPEAKER_15]: Any Dropbox that might be hiding in the background or whatever.

850
00:54:23,569 --> 00:54:24,449
[SPEAKER_15]: It's got to all go down.

851
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:25,570
[SPEAKER_15]: So, okay.

852
00:54:26,991 --> 00:54:27,831
[SPEAKER_15]: We are connected.

853
00:54:27,891 --> 00:54:28,432
[SPEAKER_15]: Here we go.

854
00:54:28,952 --> 00:54:30,153
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, podcast listeners.

855
00:54:30,193 --> 00:54:35,236
[SPEAKER_15]: I feel like Seacrest on American Idol where it's like I'm drawing it out for like two minutes, the big interview.

856
00:54:35,296 --> 00:54:37,377
[SPEAKER_15]: But please know it's for the live listeners' benefit.

857
00:54:37,757 --> 00:54:39,618
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I am showing it as streaming again.

858
00:54:40,018 --> 00:54:40,919
[SPEAKER_15]: So here we go.

859
00:54:41,459 --> 00:54:42,620
[SPEAKER_15]: The big interview with Reggie.

860
00:54:45,353 --> 00:54:45,934
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good.

861
00:54:45,974 --> 00:54:46,854
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll be here as well, right?

862
00:54:46,994 --> 00:54:47,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

863
00:54:47,535 --> 00:54:48,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody, how excited are you?

864
00:54:49,116 --> 00:54:49,716
[SPEAKER_05]: How excited?

865
00:54:49,776 --> 00:54:50,657
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very excited.

866
00:54:51,758 --> 00:54:52,478
[SPEAKER_05]: This is it, right?

867
00:54:52,658 --> 00:54:53,819
[SPEAKER_05]: This is it.

868
00:54:53,879 --> 00:54:56,141
[SPEAKER_05]: A new generation of gaming begins tonight.

869
00:54:57,321 --> 00:55:02,645
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your name?

870
00:55:02,705 --> 00:55:05,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that a British accent?

871
00:55:05,247 --> 00:55:05,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

872
00:55:05,967 --> 00:55:07,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Came all the way from the UK just to be here?

873
00:55:08,249 --> 00:55:09,750
[SPEAKER_05]: No, actually.

874
00:55:09,770 --> 00:55:10,250
[SPEAKER_05]: No, come on.

875
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:10,911
[SPEAKER_05]: You could have played me.

876
00:55:10,951 --> 00:55:13,253
[SPEAKER_05]: You could have said, yes, came all the way here.

877
00:55:15,915 --> 00:55:22,504
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a small question.

878
00:55:22,564 --> 00:55:23,825
[SPEAKER_06]: Million Coins and New Super Mario 2.

879
00:55:23,865 --> 00:55:27,751
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any comments about the current economic crisis in Mushroom Kingdom?

880
00:55:29,144 --> 00:55:31,205
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Mario's just trying to do his part.

881
00:55:31,265 --> 00:55:32,406
[SPEAKER_05]: He's collecting coins.

882
00:55:32,606 --> 00:55:35,948
[SPEAKER_05]: He'll go back and spend them someday, but he's trying to help out.

883
00:55:35,968 --> 00:55:38,669
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be no fiscal cliff in the Mushroom Kingdom.

884
00:55:39,109 --> 00:55:39,990
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much!

885
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:42,611
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you get it?

886
00:55:43,812 --> 00:55:47,714
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, so you have the chance to ask Reggie one thing.

887
00:55:52,105 --> 00:55:58,027
[SPEAKER_15]: and you chose to ask him how he feels about the fiscal cliff in the Mushroom Kingdom.

888
00:55:58,868 --> 00:56:03,630
[SPEAKER_04]: But you gotta admit that he actually picked up on it and rolled with it.

889
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:05,831
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to give the man credit for that.

890
00:56:07,251 --> 00:56:09,452
[SPEAKER_15]: Orange Lounge Radio exclusive, everybody.

891
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:13,834
[SPEAKER_15]: Reggie comments on the fiscal cliff in the Mushroom Kingdom.

892
00:56:14,794 --> 00:56:16,715
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that's pretty cool and all.

893
00:56:17,635 --> 00:56:21,617
[SPEAKER_13]: It's almost as good as me asking Jason Enos about In The Groove, but

894
00:56:22,429 --> 00:56:27,696
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure asking them about the financial crisis in a fictional video game is fucking awesome.

895
00:56:28,377 --> 00:56:29,538
[SPEAKER_13]: That's great use of time.

896
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:34,785
[SPEAKER_06]: He's going to get into the media and he's going to answer all these questions about whatever.

897
00:56:34,805 --> 00:56:35,266
[SPEAKER_07]: To be fair,

898
00:56:37,008 --> 00:56:42,674
[SPEAKER_15]: To be fair, it will be a bumper, but to be fair, Loki, you know damn well it doesn't matter what they ask.

899
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,856
[SPEAKER_15]: They would have got the same canned answer for anything.

900
00:56:44,916 --> 00:56:52,023
[SPEAKER_15]: So for them to throw him a curveball, I say you guys are the biggest fucking nerds, and I so appreciate that about you.

901
00:56:52,843 --> 00:56:53,184
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

902
00:56:55,769 --> 00:56:56,829
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that was brilliant.

903
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:01,011
[SPEAKER_07]: I would rather have had that than the canned response.

904
00:57:01,311 --> 00:57:03,171
[SPEAKER_07]: If we want the canned response, we can look at press releases.

905
00:57:04,051 --> 00:57:06,232
[SPEAKER_13]: You press them for more, whatever.

906
00:57:06,552 --> 00:57:10,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and the whole five seconds before he goes, I gotta go inside, bye.

907
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:11,994
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, Loki's jealous he wasn't there.

908
00:57:12,294 --> 00:57:14,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we're not 2020, so.

909
00:57:14,314 --> 00:57:18,835
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little bit differently, and also, you can thank Taiki, that was his idea, alright?

910
00:57:19,176 --> 00:57:20,716
[SPEAKER_04]: That went over damned well.

911
00:57:20,996 --> 00:57:26,980
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, you both contributed a lot to that segment, and I really appreciate you guys sharing that with OLR first.

912
00:57:27,041 --> 00:57:30,243
[SPEAKER_15]: I know you could have held on to that for AJS, but I really appreciate that.

913
00:57:30,963 --> 00:57:32,364
[SPEAKER_15]: VOG podcast sticking together.

914
00:57:32,404 --> 00:57:32,885
[SPEAKER_15]: It's awesome.

915
00:57:33,846 --> 00:57:34,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, that's what we're here for.

916
00:57:34,666 --> 00:57:38,389
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, the band has one of the official VOG sheets.

917
00:57:39,159 --> 00:57:39,860
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice.

918
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,061
[SPEAKER_15]: Very nice.

919
00:57:41,922 --> 00:57:45,045
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we're an hour into the show and we haven't even got to our gaming weeks yet.

920
00:57:45,106 --> 00:57:47,368
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm probably going to wrap this up so we can move on.

921
00:57:47,428 --> 00:57:49,330
[SPEAKER_15]: But you have anything else you guys want to get out?

922
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:50,371
[SPEAKER_15]: Taiki, great job.

923
00:57:51,072 --> 00:57:53,014
[SPEAKER_15]: Anything you want to get out here before we let you go?

924
00:57:54,235 --> 00:57:56,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I talk about the issue of Quebec independence?

925
00:57:57,439 --> 00:57:57,959
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want.

926
00:57:58,780 --> 00:57:59,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Independence for Quebec now.

927
00:58:00,582 --> 00:58:01,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Viva Quebec.

928
00:58:02,783 --> 00:58:04,063
[SPEAKER_15]: Ramma, anything you want to get out?

929
00:58:04,483 --> 00:58:05,604
[SPEAKER_07]: They can succeed a little with Texas.

930
00:58:05,624 --> 00:58:07,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but I think I should save it for calling back later.

931
00:58:08,004 --> 00:58:10,465
[SPEAKER_04]: It has something to do with Wii U's and ShameStop.

932
00:58:11,165 --> 00:58:11,645
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, boy.

933
00:58:11,765 --> 00:58:12,085
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

934
00:58:12,185 --> 00:58:13,345
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, hopefully talk to you later.

935
00:58:13,385 --> 00:58:15,506
[SPEAKER_15]: Hopefully you don't run too long tonight and I can take a lot of calls.

936
00:58:15,606 --> 00:58:15,886
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

937
00:58:16,246 --> 00:58:16,706
[SPEAKER_15]: No problem.

938
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:17,166
[SPEAKER_15]: Take care, buddy.

939
00:58:17,566 --> 00:58:18,546
[SPEAKER_15]: And thanks, guys.

940
00:58:19,026 --> 00:58:19,387
[SPEAKER_15]: No problem.

941
00:58:20,147 --> 00:58:24,008
[SPEAKER_15]: You can hear Anime Jam Session Tuesdays at vognetwork.com, 630 Pacific, 930 Eastern.

942
00:58:28,447 --> 00:58:40,315
[SPEAKER_15]: To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio at vognetwork.com Use the passphrase, bronze Big thanks to them for being out there Even though their questions were a little bit lulzy You know what?

943
00:58:42,176 --> 00:58:49,241
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll take it Alright, moving on Let's get to our video game weeks And how was our gaming week?

944
00:58:49,281 --> 00:58:51,062
[SPEAKER_15]: It's only an hour into the show Loki!

945
00:58:52,363 --> 00:58:52,963
[SPEAKER_15]: How you doing?

946
00:58:53,163 --> 00:58:54,844
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh wait, I always start with Jamie How you doing?

947
00:58:54,884 --> 00:58:55,665
[SPEAKER_15]: How was your gaming week?

948
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:58,149
[SPEAKER_15]: I already know what she's going to say.

949
00:58:58,169 --> 00:58:58,810
[SPEAKER_07]: It was sweet.

950
00:59:00,513 --> 00:59:01,254
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, what's that?

951
00:59:01,832 --> 00:59:06,254
[SPEAKER_07]: I played and beat Sugar Rush on the Wreck-It Ralph website.

952
00:59:07,255 --> 00:59:08,355
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fucking fun.

953
00:59:08,455 --> 00:59:10,136
[SPEAKER_07]: It needs to be like a for-reals game.

954
00:59:10,536 --> 00:59:16,799
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, and I was actually really surprised by how long it was, because I mean, I was playing for a few solid hours.

955
00:59:16,959 --> 00:59:27,424
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like you have four stages with three races in each stage, and like the first two, I think, are two laps, and then the third one is three laps, and then the last one's three laps.

956
00:59:28,045 --> 00:59:30,386
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's much longer and complex.

957
00:59:30,546 --> 00:59:30,646
[SPEAKER_07]: And

958
00:59:31,366 --> 00:59:40,454
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's like a stupid little kart racer, but it was really fun, and I've decided that Rancis is the best name ever, and my firstborn, if I have one, will be Rancis.

959
00:59:41,134 --> 00:59:44,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Rancis Flubberbuffer, whatever his name is.

960
00:59:44,657 --> 00:59:46,399
[SPEAKER_07]: The one with the Reese's Cup on his head.

961
00:59:47,419 --> 00:59:47,700
[SPEAKER_07]: And then...

962
00:59:49,804 --> 00:59:52,526
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I played a bunch of Mass Effect 2.

963
00:59:52,646 --> 00:59:53,646
[SPEAKER_07]: I played a bunch of it today.

964
00:59:54,206 --> 00:59:54,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.

965
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:56,848
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I actually did a whole bunch of design work.

966
00:59:57,048 --> 01:00:03,831
[SPEAKER_07]: But my design work had me going and pulling samples off of old video game packaging.

967
01:00:03,932 --> 01:00:05,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I wanted certain colors.

968
01:00:05,993 --> 01:00:08,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I pulled the gold off the Nintendo cartridge.

969
01:00:08,454 --> 01:00:09,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Off of the Zelda cartridge.

970
01:00:09,935 --> 01:00:10,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

971
01:00:10,615 --> 01:00:12,856
[SPEAKER_07]: because I wanted that particular shade.

972
01:00:13,136 --> 01:00:18,537
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's like when you sample part of it, it comes out kind of this muted brown.

973
01:00:19,578 --> 01:00:20,638
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was the color I wanted.

974
01:00:21,298 --> 01:00:23,499
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, what do I know that reflects that color?

975
01:00:23,539 --> 01:00:28,640
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was sampling NES cartridges to get the right shade of brown off of a gold Zelda cartridge.

976
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:29,420
[SPEAKER_14]: Very cool.

977
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:34,982
[SPEAKER_07]: And I actually logged into WoW just because I don't want to get kicked out of the guild.

978
01:00:35,002 --> 01:00:35,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

979
01:00:36,375 --> 01:01:03,110
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate to say that but I mean I'm trying to build myself back up into actually wanting to level my troll it's just no one plays on Blade's Edge anymore and that's the only character I have I really care about is my main on there Ragenator at live.vognetwork.com expressing surprise DarkSakura won't name her firstborn Garrus WTF no Rancis no actually I'm probably never going to have a kid so it doesn't matter oh no

980
01:01:03,579 --> 01:01:04,599
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm serious.

981
01:01:04,819 --> 01:01:06,520
[SPEAKER_07]: At this point, I'm perfectly content with it.

982
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:09,321
[SPEAKER_07]: All you people who have kids, good luck.

983
01:01:09,381 --> 01:01:09,761
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

984
01:01:09,781 --> 01:01:11,442
[SPEAKER_15]: You will have a new kitty to name someday.

985
01:01:11,502 --> 01:01:13,122
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a very similar dilemma.

986
01:01:13,323 --> 01:01:14,763
[SPEAKER_07]: I need a cat in my life right now.

987
01:01:15,763 --> 01:01:18,745
[SPEAKER_07]: But Dan's like, we have to buy a house first.

988
01:01:19,525 --> 01:01:20,465
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm like, well, fine.

989
01:01:20,505 --> 01:01:21,886
[SPEAKER_07]: If I can buy a house, I can get a cat.

990
01:01:21,986 --> 01:01:24,487
[SPEAKER_15]: For the cat, because the cat needs the house.

991
01:01:24,527 --> 01:01:25,207
[SPEAKER_15]: It won't be your house.

992
01:01:25,247 --> 01:01:26,047
[SPEAKER_15]: It'll be the cat's house.

993
01:01:26,267 --> 01:01:29,048
[SPEAKER_07]: I've decided that when I get a cat, it's going to be named Mochi.

994
01:01:29,448 --> 01:01:29,829
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't care.

995
01:01:29,969 --> 01:01:30,849
[SPEAKER_07]: My cat will be named Mochi.

996
01:01:31,269 --> 01:01:31,709
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a good name.

997
01:01:32,470 --> 01:01:35,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything else for your gaming week?

998
01:01:35,751 --> 01:01:36,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Cooking with dog.

999
01:01:37,752 --> 01:01:38,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, no.

1000
01:01:39,553 --> 01:01:44,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Going in between playing Mass Effect 2, pausing my game, making udon because I'm also watching cooking with dog.

1001
01:01:45,516 --> 01:01:46,936
[SPEAKER_07]: And then going back and playing more Mass Effect.

1002
01:01:46,956 --> 01:01:47,737
[SPEAKER_07]: That's been my cycle.

1003
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Mass Effect, cooking with dog, cooking.

1004
01:01:50,258 --> 01:01:51,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Mass Effect, cooking with dog, cooking.

1005
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:54,280
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, how was your gaming week?

1006
01:01:55,172 --> 01:02:23,043
[SPEAKER_13]: I played Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 Call of Duty Black Ops 2 because I'm really getting into the single player campaign tried some more of the multiplayer just kind of some system link stuff at work the rest we should be getting copies for everybody this week so we can play some of that and so far loved every minute of it hasn't let me down at all so I'm looking forward to that and I think I fit in a little bit of Minecraft this week as well

1007
01:02:25,242 --> 01:02:26,383
[SPEAKER_13]: That's pretty much it.

1008
01:02:27,123 --> 01:02:27,923
[SPEAKER_15]: Jason, how about you?

1009
01:02:27,963 --> 01:02:29,304
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been a while since we've seen you last.

1010
01:02:29,344 --> 01:02:30,584
[SPEAKER_15]: What's been going on in your gaming world?

1011
01:02:30,785 --> 01:02:33,846
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, for that time frame... No, not that whole time frame.

1012
01:02:34,846 --> 01:02:39,849
[SPEAKER_16]: I've actually been out here for work for a week at this point, just over a week.

1013
01:02:40,709 --> 01:02:46,392
[SPEAKER_16]: So the literal week has been rather light because I've been having exciting San Francisco, California fun times.

1014
01:02:46,872 --> 01:02:49,953
[SPEAKER_16]: But there is a setup at the office, and the office favorite is FIFA 13, so I've...

1015
01:02:51,294 --> 01:02:55,677
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been thoroughly trashed at that game, both by the computer and by my coworkers.

1016
01:02:55,837 --> 01:02:58,218
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that the one that they're hazing for being just like FIFA 12?

1017
01:02:58,578 --> 01:03:00,379
[SPEAKER_16]: Isn't that all sports games in this generation?

1018
01:03:00,399 --> 01:03:01,020
[SPEAKER_15]: That's on the Wii.

1019
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:03,661
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, like, for real, it is a carbon copy.

1020
01:03:03,701 --> 01:03:05,222
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, I'm not, like, no joke.

1021
01:03:05,242 --> 01:03:07,223
[SPEAKER_15]: That and Pro Evo are both carbon copies.

1022
01:03:07,423 --> 01:03:15,608
[SPEAKER_16]: The last time I was out here, they did have FIFA 12, and the game, the only notable difference I've noticed is that they give you more interactivity during the loading screen.

1023
01:03:16,108 --> 01:03:26,652
[SPEAKER_16]: But I completely admit that's completely superficial because I start a multiplayer game and go with it and I can't really comment to single player, you know, GM, those kind of bonus modes, anything like that.

1024
01:03:26,692 --> 01:03:27,592
[SPEAKER_16]: I couldn't say at all.

1025
01:03:28,712 --> 01:03:38,496
[SPEAKER_16]: They did also get Halo 4 and I started a campaign by myself on, I think the tier is easy, normal, legendary, heroic and I'm on legendary because I thought I could keep up.

1026
01:03:39,977 --> 01:04:02,130
[SPEAKER_16]: uh no oh Dan made that mistake no I'm it might be passable with help you know a multiplayer legendary campaign but me by myself I'm still in chapter one and I gave up after playing the same checkpoint just past the same checkpoint about 30 40 times maybe more I'm not entirely sure I suck at Halo and I'm very very sad at this fact

1027
01:04:04,364 --> 01:04:06,586
[SPEAKER_16]: Otherwise, yeah, that's really it.

1028
01:04:06,867 --> 01:04:11,851
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm still nursing Borderlands 2 since I've been traveling quite a bit over these past two months.

1029
01:04:12,612 --> 01:04:16,916
[SPEAKER_16]: And not really sit down and play meaningful games time lately, unfortunately.

1030
01:04:17,897 --> 01:04:18,298
[SPEAKER_15]: Alrighty.

1031
01:04:19,319 --> 01:04:25,605
[SPEAKER_15]: Most of my week I already talked about with the Wii U launch, so in the interest of time I'm not going to repeat myself, but I will talk about just quickly...

1032
01:04:26,105 --> 01:04:33,171
[SPEAKER_15]: Played a little bit of Mass Effect 3 because we tried to set it up so that we have two TVs and two Xbox 360s here at the house.

1033
01:04:33,551 --> 01:04:38,195
[SPEAKER_15]: So Alan and I were like, can we play multiplayer with each other even though we only have one copy of the game?

1034
01:04:38,255 --> 01:04:42,058
[SPEAKER_15]: And we figured out yes we can because all of multiplayer is on both discs.

1035
01:04:42,438 --> 01:04:56,447
[SPEAKER_15]: So we put one disc in one and one in the other and how we got around the online pass is I had Alan play on my usual Xbox and I played on the other one because when you have licensed content on the 360 it's licensed to the original console and your ID.

1036
01:04:56,867 --> 01:05:05,252
[SPEAKER_15]: So we made it work and we played and Alan decided he hated it because having to go from keyboard and mouse to controller apparently not a good fit.

1037
01:05:05,832 --> 01:05:13,981
[SPEAKER_15]: I also played some Halo 4, finished the first five episodes of Spartan Ops playing with a friend, so that was fun.

1038
01:05:14,001 --> 01:05:16,304
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we actually did six, so that was cool.

1039
01:05:16,824 --> 01:05:17,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, Halo, good times.

1040
01:05:17,985 --> 01:05:19,107
[SPEAKER_16]: Emphasis on with a friend.

1041
01:05:19,647 --> 01:05:22,630
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, and we play on, I think Spartan Ops we did normal.

1042
01:05:23,328 --> 01:05:48,182
[SPEAKER_15]: you know so you know we don't we are not too crazy now all right uh some housekeeping for you guys please remember you can follow us on facebook facebook.com slash orange launch radio as well as twitter twitter.com slash olr meanwhile let's get into some news and a quick thank you to everybody voting in the podcast awards which are now closed thank you very much absolutely yes so thank you to everybody who voted for us in the podcast awards and if you didn't i hope you kept it indie

1043
01:05:49,335 --> 01:06:15,053
[SPEAKER_15]: I forgot one more game oh hurry Fairy Solitaire oh I played that too thanks to that tip last week it's cute yeah it's free I can't complain better than Yaris all right let's get into some news Loki Rob having your head drilled open with your brains falling out is better than Yaris all right so there was a there was a system that launched today the Wii U and really I hadn't

1044
01:06:18,519 --> 01:06:19,760
[SPEAKER_13]: I can see how you can be confused.

1045
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,761
[SPEAKER_13]: It is very similar to the previous generation.

1046
01:06:24,823 --> 01:06:28,665
[SPEAKER_13]: You may have been confused and bought another Wii, so you better double check that.

1047
01:06:28,885 --> 01:06:29,966
[SPEAKER_07]: No, this one's black.

1048
01:06:31,106 --> 01:06:32,167
[SPEAKER_13]: They do make black Wiis now.

1049
01:06:35,329 --> 01:06:36,589
[SPEAKER_13]: So, let's see.

1050
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:40,192
[SPEAKER_13]: You know the difference between the Wii U and the Wiis.

1051
01:06:40,252 --> 01:06:42,813
[SPEAKER_13]: The Wii has functioning online right now.

1052
01:06:43,013 --> 01:06:43,814
[SPEAKER_13]: That's pretty sad.

1053
01:06:45,242 --> 01:06:53,446
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, so the Wii they claim is going to be in larger supply, probably due to less demand, but it is going to be easily more available.

1054
01:06:53,986 --> 01:07:12,314
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not going to make their artificial shortage as big this time around, but he says basically their second and third, fourth replenishments are going to be more frequent at holiday time, and you'll be able to get a Wii system or Wii U system before next year, or next holiday, I guess.

1055
01:07:13,475 --> 01:07:15,236
[SPEAKER_13]: Which is good, I suppose.

1056
01:07:17,477 --> 01:07:24,321
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, like with most Nintendo console launches of recent, it is missing a few things.

1057
01:07:24,601 --> 01:07:37,009
[SPEAKER_13]: And the first being Nintendo's highly advertised and pimped out TV service, which was supposed to be launching with the console, but oh, you know, it's not done, so...

1058
01:07:37,449 --> 01:07:45,516
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to be launching in December, and until then, you're at the wait to watch live TV through this, or your on-demand stuff, Netflix, etc.

1059
01:07:46,577 --> 01:07:50,260
[SPEAKER_13]: So it'll be coming in the next few weeks, unless they delay it again, because that's something they do.

1060
01:07:52,102 --> 01:07:54,023
[SPEAKER_13]: And then also, of course... Fun!

1061
01:07:55,464 --> 01:07:56,886
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm kidding, it's a fun console.

1062
01:07:57,466 --> 01:07:58,447
[SPEAKER_15]: It's an easy joke to make.

1063
01:07:58,627 --> 01:07:59,888
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's a fun console.

1064
01:08:00,948 --> 01:08:11,012
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm sure that everybody was really happy that waited in line to get their Wii U system to get home and download your 5GB firmware update, which is fantastic.

1065
01:08:11,732 --> 01:08:16,654
[SPEAKER_13]: And, of course, this would also encompass the Miiverse stuff as well.

1066
01:08:17,414 --> 01:08:26,578
[SPEAKER_13]: It's funny, though, because apparently there's some people that were having issues with it downloading so slow they thought their console was not working, so they shut it off

1067
01:08:27,698 --> 01:08:48,702
[SPEAKER_13]: not a good idea and now their console doesn't work but uh yes five gigabytes so if you're thinking about it if you got that non-black system you have less than half of that storage space left for stuff obviously you're not going to put an actual game on there because there's no room for it but you're not going to be able to fit you know

1068
01:08:49,782 --> 01:08:56,523
[SPEAKER_13]: You're going to basically need to get an external storage device, which is kind of... You kind of would have had to anyways, but still.

1069
01:08:57,283 --> 01:08:58,164
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not as bad.

1070
01:08:58,184 --> 01:09:02,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember when the Xbox 360 came out and everyone's like, Oh, hey, the 20 gig hard drives.

1071
01:09:02,784 --> 01:09:02,985
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

1072
01:09:04,605 --> 01:09:08,506
[SPEAKER_13]: 7 gigabytes of this is just the backwards compatibility data.

1073
01:09:09,586 --> 01:09:10,626
[SPEAKER_13]: This is almost as bad.

1074
01:09:11,406 --> 01:09:16,107
[SPEAKER_13]: Except they didn't have to wait an hour for the backwards compatibility data to exist on that hard drive.

1075
01:09:17,589 --> 01:09:32,777
[SPEAKER_13]: and, um, of course, you know, with any network launch, this would be for MMOs and stuff, they've been having a little bit of issues, uh, it's been kind of up and down, probably because of the, you know, high traffic, but thankfully it is back up, so.

1076
01:09:34,117 --> 01:09:34,597
[SPEAKER_13]: Fantastic.

1077
01:09:34,677 --> 01:09:36,178
[SPEAKER_15]: It worked fine for me, for what it's worth.

1078
01:09:36,418 --> 01:09:40,679
[SPEAKER_15]: To be fair, it did take an hour, but I expect that 5 gigs is going to take an hour to download.

1079
01:09:41,159 --> 01:09:44,099
[SPEAKER_15]: But it did work fine, and I haven't really had connectivity problems.

1080
01:09:45,579 --> 01:09:48,120
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Wii video chat was a little bumpy.

1081
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:53,061
[SPEAKER_15]: We got some weird error messages that weren't even true, because we were able to connect fine.

1082
01:09:53,081 --> 01:09:53,561
[SPEAKER_15]: It was weird.

1083
01:09:54,101 --> 01:09:56,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Warning, the person on the other end does not exist.

1084
01:09:57,202 --> 01:09:58,162
[SPEAKER_13]: Not quite that, but yeah.

1085
01:10:01,124 --> 01:10:02,306
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1086
01:10:02,466 --> 01:10:04,508
[SPEAKER_13]: So, there's your Wii U launch.

1087
01:10:05,409 --> 01:10:06,070
[SPEAKER_13]: Get excited.

1088
01:10:07,091 --> 01:10:07,872
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm thrilled.

1089
01:10:08,813 --> 01:10:09,133
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

1090
01:10:09,674 --> 01:10:11,496
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, not too thrilled is this guy.

1091
01:10:11,996 --> 01:10:13,298
[SPEAKER_15]: He got caught by the police.

1092
01:10:14,392 --> 01:10:16,193
[SPEAKER_15]: Justin Success Brooks.

1093
01:10:16,773 --> 01:10:18,474
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, his name was Success Brooks.

1094
01:10:19,115 --> 01:10:29,341
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, unfortunately, he wasn't very successful in his business of selling counterfeit Nintendo games in the UK because he got caught and sentenced to 32 months of jail time.

1095
01:10:29,881 --> 01:10:31,982
[SPEAKER_15]: He was actually selling counterfeited games.

1096
01:10:32,382 --> 01:10:36,665
[SPEAKER_15]: He was working with some dealers in China through 18 different websites.

1097
01:10:37,265 --> 01:10:59,101
[SPEAKER_15]: Nintendo had warned, the UK border agency had warned, he had his stock seized at one point however he continued to sell the games through a different website so it was kind of one of those, they weren't going to keep him out any other way so they officially sentenced him to 32 months although even in the UK you don't really end up serving the entire time he'll probably only be serving about half of it

1098
01:11:00,754 --> 01:11:12,447
[SPEAKER_15]: What's interesting, Francesca Levitt, who is one of the prosecutors on this case, claiming the victim is not really Nintendo, but legitimate online game retailers who have to compete with counterfeit sellers.

1099
01:11:12,968 --> 01:11:13,228
[SPEAKER_15]: Quote,

1100
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:44,086
[SPEAKER_16]: but the damage this has done to the reputation of online retailers is untold and incalculable that's in a statement to the Guardian I would take that down one last one more notch that not so much Evil G and those others but people who do like the use game stores or import game stores or the people who really try to carve out their niche that oh yeah they also sell big retail titles mainstream titles because you don't survive as a business any other way

1101
01:11:45,538 --> 01:11:51,139
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it is a good reminder that this kind of stuff doesn't just hurt Nintendo.

1102
01:11:51,179 --> 01:11:55,360
[SPEAKER_15]: It hurts everybody in the chain from developers and makers to the people that sell them.

1103
01:11:56,501 --> 01:11:57,381
[SPEAKER_07]: It hurts my feelings.

1104
01:11:58,121 --> 01:11:58,981
[SPEAKER_15]: And Jamie's feelings.

1105
01:11:59,021 --> 01:12:00,341
[SPEAKER_07]: And it gives Reggie hemorrhoids.

1106
01:12:01,182 --> 01:12:01,442
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1107
01:12:02,682 --> 01:12:03,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Because he's all butthurt.

1108
01:12:04,082 --> 01:12:04,482
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I see.

1109
01:12:05,183 --> 01:12:05,503
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1110
01:12:05,823 --> 01:12:07,463
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's move on with another story, DarkSakura.

1111
01:12:08,503 --> 01:12:08,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1112
01:12:09,163 --> 01:12:11,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, who likes Pokemans?

1113
01:12:12,025 --> 01:12:15,588
[SPEAKER_15]: Who doesn't like Pokemans?

1114
01:12:15,888 --> 01:12:17,269
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course Loki raised his hand.

1115
01:12:17,729 --> 01:12:26,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, actually Nintendo is doing Pokedex iOS, which is their first paid app in the Apple Store.

1116
01:12:26,916 --> 01:12:29,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, it's only out in Japan right now.

1117
01:12:29,958 --> 01:12:33,780
[SPEAKER_07]: And it covers everything up through black and white.

1118
01:12:34,581 --> 01:12:37,423
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's 170 yen, which is about £1.30.

1119
01:12:37,623 --> 01:12:40,405
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess here it would be maybe a $3 download.

1120
01:12:41,986 --> 01:12:49,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, there's also extra packs with other monsters that, um, go up to, uh, 500 yen.

1121
01:12:49,514 --> 01:12:52,597
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, yeah, you could pay a lot of money for it.

1122
01:12:52,897 --> 01:13:03,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but now, uh, there's still, um, a free app that's the Pokemon Say Tap that was, uh, out for a little bit last year, but for right now, this is their first paid app.

1123
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:21,873
[SPEAKER_16]: I have to say that in some of it may be the language and I know that interfaces do vary highly in between languages but this Pokedex iOS looks kind of as crap as Pokedex 3D on the 3DS store.

1124
01:13:22,074 --> 01:13:23,454
[SPEAKER_16]: I never liked it.

1125
01:13:24,215 --> 01:13:33,019
[SPEAKER_16]: It may also be that I've kind of abandoned ship as far as Pokemon is concerned and I haven't played it recently enough so I didn't none of the creatures were familiar but this doesn't

1126
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:37,980
[SPEAKER_15]: I heard that this thing is full of in-game purchases, too.

1127
01:13:38,241 --> 01:13:39,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, that's what I was saying.

1128
01:13:39,901 --> 01:13:43,642
[SPEAKER_07]: There's four extra packs, and they're 500 yen total.

1129
01:13:43,682 --> 01:13:44,342
[SPEAKER_15]: They ain't free.

1130
01:13:44,883 --> 01:13:47,723
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I mean, you roughly end up paying about seven bucks.

1131
01:13:48,464 --> 01:13:48,724
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

1132
01:13:49,144 --> 01:13:49,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Six or seven.

1133
01:13:51,164 --> 01:13:55,946
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm trying to do a little bit of conversion here, but yeah, you end up paying more like about six bucks.

1134
01:13:56,306 --> 01:13:58,827
[SPEAKER_15]: So Loki, you got to be excited about this.

1135
01:13:58,907 --> 01:14:02,969
[SPEAKER_15]: It's Nintendo on an Apple product full of microtransactions.

1136
01:14:03,029 --> 01:14:04,689
[SPEAKER_15]: This is like made for you.

1137
01:14:06,110 --> 01:14:12,092
[SPEAKER_13]: It sounds like just any other app on the iOS, Apple Store or whatever.

1138
01:14:13,433 --> 01:14:17,174
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's just what's interesting is it's not a knockoff for once.

1139
01:14:18,075 --> 01:14:18,615
[SPEAKER_15]: This is true.

1140
01:14:19,535 --> 01:14:22,537
[SPEAKER_15]: And plus the whole, oh my gosh, it's something Nintendo on Apple.

1141
01:14:22,577 --> 01:14:30,202
[SPEAKER_15]: But before the emails correcting us come in, we should say there's a very different relationship when it comes to the Pokemon company.

1142
01:14:30,622 --> 01:14:38,948
[SPEAKER_15]: Because even though Nintendo somewhat controls them at the end of the day, if the Pokemon company wants to do something different, they can.

1143
01:14:39,288 --> 01:14:43,150
[SPEAKER_15]: And so for them to be the ones dipping their big toe in with this iOS app is not...

1144
01:14:44,271 --> 01:14:45,452
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not too surprising.

1145
01:14:45,472 --> 01:14:52,397
[SPEAKER_15]: And it could be interesting because if this does very well, which, who knows, maybe that will cause Nintendo?

1146
01:14:52,517 --> 01:14:52,857
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

1147
01:14:52,897 --> 01:15:02,504
[SPEAKER_15]: But then again, Nintendo's always been very much, no, ever since the CDI, never again will our characters be on another console.

1148
01:15:03,305 --> 01:15:03,485
[SPEAKER_15]: So...

1149
01:15:04,385 --> 01:15:07,226
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, moving on.

1150
01:15:08,727 --> 01:15:09,027
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1151
01:15:09,547 --> 01:15:14,369
[SPEAKER_13]: So let's talk a little bit about non-Nintendo stuff.

1152
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:16,470
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's talk about Microsoft.

1153
01:15:16,530 --> 01:15:21,332
[SPEAKER_13]: And of course, they were celebrating the 10-year anniversary of Xbox Live.

1154
01:15:21,812 --> 01:15:32,977
[SPEAKER_13]: And with that, they were giving out some fancy Xbox Live 10-year anniversary themed Xbox 360s to people that had been on live for those 10 years.

1155
01:15:34,451 --> 01:15:35,731
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, certain people didn't get them.

1156
01:15:37,952 --> 01:15:38,452
[SPEAKER_13]: Like Bobby.

1157
01:15:40,793 --> 01:15:41,273
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, Bobby.

1158
01:15:42,173 --> 01:15:45,294
[SPEAKER_13]: But there's some random users were getting them.

1159
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:47,855
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think every 10-year user got one.

1160
01:15:47,895 --> 01:15:52,736
[SPEAKER_15]: You probably got entered into a drawing or something behind the scenes and they gave away like 100 of them or something.

1161
01:15:52,936 --> 01:15:54,056
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, they never really explained it.

1162
01:15:54,556 --> 01:15:57,197
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't really make any sense to me that they would give you a console.

1163
01:15:57,217 --> 01:16:01,138
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, that's kind of cool that you get a console, but wouldn't you already have a console if you're on Xbox Live?

1164
01:16:01,178 --> 01:16:02,779
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like, hooray!

1165
01:16:02,799 --> 01:16:03,219
[SPEAKER_13]: My red ringed.

1166
01:16:04,119 --> 01:16:12,267
[SPEAKER_16]: All the people that won it are the people that have lived through about five or six Red Rings and E74s, so the next time it invariably happens to their next one, they have a replacement already.

1167
01:16:13,648 --> 01:16:15,170
[SPEAKER_16]: And it looks pretty cool, actually.

1168
01:16:15,501 --> 01:16:17,142
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1169
01:16:17,882 --> 01:16:20,443
[SPEAKER_13]: It's neat, I guess.

1170
01:16:21,523 --> 01:16:29,146
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of you who may have been on there for 10 years will maybe get in an email or something saying, hey, you got a 360 coming your way.

1171
01:16:29,186 --> 01:16:35,548
[SPEAKER_15]: You probably would have already got that email or you got the email that I got that says, congrats, here's your code for an avatar helmet.

1172
01:16:36,408 --> 01:16:38,229
[SPEAKER_13]: I got an email and two messages.

1173
01:16:38,249 --> 01:16:38,989
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

1174
01:16:40,444 --> 01:16:42,008
[SPEAKER_15]: Take the fucking helmet, Loki.

1175
01:16:42,269 --> 01:16:42,990
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want the helmet.

1176
01:16:43,171 --> 01:16:43,472
[SPEAKER_15]: Take it.

1177
01:16:43,652 --> 01:16:44,474
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not wearing the helmet.

1178
01:16:44,594 --> 01:16:44,795
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1179
01:16:45,036 --> 01:16:45,276
[SPEAKER_15]: Take it.

1180
01:16:45,296 --> 01:16:45,958
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's another message.

1181
01:16:45,998 --> 01:16:46,660
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's another code.

1182
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:47,462
[SPEAKER_15]: Take the damn helmet.

1183
01:16:47,482 --> 01:16:49,246
[SPEAKER_07]: It puts the helmet on its avatar.

1184
01:16:53,391 --> 01:16:53,651
[SPEAKER_15]: Nice.

1185
01:16:55,293 --> 01:17:02,859
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, speaking of Microsoft, this is interesting because we know the PlayStation magazine's stopping, the Nintendo Power's stopping.

1186
01:17:02,919 --> 01:17:06,762
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Xbox World is also going to cease publishing in December.

1187
01:17:07,222 --> 01:17:08,123
[SPEAKER_15]: But this is what's interesting.

1188
01:17:08,143 --> 01:17:12,387
[SPEAKER_15]: This is one over in the UK, and the last issue is going out with a bang.

1189
01:17:13,628 --> 01:17:21,114
[SPEAKER_15]: Details on the next Xbox, which they say is going the way of Apple and is going to be called simply Xbox.

1190
01:17:23,835 --> 01:17:25,276
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki is shaking his head.

1191
01:17:25,797 --> 01:17:26,057
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

1192
01:17:26,617 --> 01:17:27,338
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just dumb.

1193
01:17:28,038 --> 01:17:32,221
[SPEAKER_13]: And Sony's brand new TV called TV... It's called the new TV.

1194
01:17:32,561 --> 01:17:37,085
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like... Thank you for not making it fucking confusing.

1195
01:17:37,565 --> 01:17:39,587
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just gonna call it something else anyways.

1196
01:17:39,747 --> 01:17:41,448
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just basically saying, hey, you know what?

1197
01:17:41,768 --> 01:17:44,210
[SPEAKER_13]: We just didn't want to market a name that people are gonna make fun of.

1198
01:17:44,230 --> 01:17:48,193
[SPEAKER_13]: We're just gonna market a name that we already had that people can make fun of or something.

1199
01:17:48,253 --> 01:17:49,634
[SPEAKER_15]: To be fair, it's rumor.

1200
01:17:49,734 --> 01:17:50,234
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't know.

1201
01:17:50,314 --> 01:17:50,795
[SPEAKER_15]: But anyway...

1202
01:17:51,315 --> 01:18:07,766
[SPEAKER_15]: 8 gigs of RAM, quad core processor, it will run Blu-ray discs, supposedly going to have in the future, like some type of future add-on would be a head-mounted augmented reality device, and there will also be a next generation Kinect, which I think we all see as kind of a duh.

1203
01:18:08,706 --> 01:18:17,989
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyhow, in a statement, Xbox World Editor-in-Chief Dan Dawkins said, Xbox World has been at the cutting edge of Durango coverage for over 12 months.

1204
01:18:18,410 --> 01:18:26,392
[SPEAKER_15]: Unless something really dramatic changes, everything we reveal in our penultimate issue will be revealed long before E3 in June.

1205
01:18:26,432 --> 01:18:29,673
[SPEAKER_15]: That was in an interview with CVG overseas.

1206
01:18:29,854 --> 01:18:34,015
[SPEAKER_13]: So basically they just recapped the original leaked rumor thing that, you know.

1207
01:18:34,244 --> 01:18:34,924
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not going to be glasses.

1208
01:18:34,944 --> 01:18:34,984
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1209
01:18:55,235 --> 01:18:57,900
[SPEAKER_15]: You'd get into a lot of accessibility issues with glasses.

1210
01:18:58,561 --> 01:19:00,184
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why the projection thing made more sense.

1211
01:19:00,204 --> 01:19:03,190
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why 3D TVs aren't popular because you have to buy the glasses.

1212
01:19:03,310 --> 01:19:03,871
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a good point.

1213
01:19:04,492 --> 01:19:05,354
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's just...

1214
01:19:07,395 --> 01:19:07,775
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1215
01:19:08,096 --> 01:19:10,037
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just... No.

1216
01:19:10,097 --> 01:19:16,563
[SPEAKER_15]: WhatUpG in chat says at live.vognetwork.com says Next E3 is supposed to be the coming out party for the PS4 slash 720.

1217
01:19:17,564 --> 01:19:19,606
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, that's the assumption we're all making.

1218
01:19:20,026 --> 01:19:23,289
[SPEAKER_15]: And it sounds like at least in Microsoft's case that'll be true.

1219
01:19:23,869 --> 01:19:24,089
[SPEAKER_15]: But...

1220
01:19:25,170 --> 01:19:27,391
[SPEAKER_15]: Why is this necessarily true for Sony?

1221
01:19:27,871 --> 01:19:30,932
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there any indication that Sony is really going to debut this?

1222
01:19:30,992 --> 01:19:32,912
[SPEAKER_15]: Or is this wishful thinking on the community's part?

1223
01:19:32,992 --> 01:19:33,993
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's all wishful thinking.

1224
01:19:34,033 --> 01:19:36,273
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think anyone's going to debut a system next year.

1225
01:19:36,773 --> 01:19:38,754
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you think Microsoft's going to hold off too?

1226
01:19:38,814 --> 01:19:40,935
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that the Wii is not going to do as well.

1227
01:19:41,075 --> 01:19:44,156
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not going to take over the Xbox 360 and the PS3.

1228
01:19:44,656 --> 01:19:45,436
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're just like, meh.

1229
01:19:45,956 --> 01:19:46,897
[SPEAKER_13]: Why do we have to hurry?

1230
01:19:47,397 --> 01:19:48,418
[SPEAKER_13]: There's really no hurry.

1231
01:20:03,308 --> 01:20:03,769
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess.

1232
01:20:03,789 --> 01:20:12,896
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, if you look at what they have slated so far, what Microsoft has announced, they only have first quarter next year that's been announced, or even the first half of next year.

1233
01:20:13,416 --> 01:20:15,898
[SPEAKER_13]: And Sony's kind of similar.

1234
01:20:15,979 --> 01:20:18,020
[SPEAKER_13]: They've got a few things that they've announced.

1235
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:19,862
[SPEAKER_13]: They've got about three or four titles.

1236
01:20:20,302 --> 01:20:24,725
[SPEAKER_13]: Those could all be first half of next year, but they haven't really... I mean, it's a little early to now.

1237
01:20:24,765 --> 01:20:26,747
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the second half because you want to have something for E3.

1238
01:20:26,767 --> 01:20:30,529
[SPEAKER_15]: You think The Last Office and the... What's that other big one?

1239
01:20:30,609 --> 01:20:34,372
[SPEAKER_15]: The one that keeps disappearing at various E3s.

1240
01:20:34,772 --> 01:20:35,473
[SPEAKER_15]: The Last Guardian?

1241
01:20:35,553 --> 01:20:36,553
[SPEAKER_15]: Last Guardian, thank you.

1242
01:20:37,214 --> 01:20:39,856
[SPEAKER_15]: There's no way in hell Last Guardian's out before next holiday.

1243
01:20:40,897 --> 01:20:42,338
[SPEAKER_15]: And then on top of that, you still have...

1244
01:20:43,258 --> 01:20:46,623
[SPEAKER_15]: Whatever happened to 13 Versus?

1245
01:20:46,683 --> 01:20:47,684
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't know where that is.

1246
01:20:47,704 --> 01:20:51,990
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, that's third party, but a lot of Final Fantasy fans care.

1247
01:20:52,210 --> 01:20:57,377
[SPEAKER_15]: And like it or not, 14 Reborn, that ain't happened until at least summer next year.

1248
01:20:58,888 --> 01:21:03,915
[SPEAKER_15]: So, we know there is stuff on the calendar up to the holiday, at least in Sony's department.

1249
01:21:05,096 --> 01:21:06,318
[SPEAKER_15]: So, that's interesting.

1250
01:21:06,678 --> 01:21:09,302
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I mean, that's not Sony, though, necessarily.

1251
01:21:09,342 --> 01:21:10,723
[SPEAKER_13]: That's third-party companies.

1252
01:21:10,763 --> 01:21:13,888
[SPEAKER_13]: And, obviously, you're going to have third parties, you know, putting out titles.

1253
01:21:13,928 --> 01:21:17,092
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, Tomb Raider is supposed to be... Well, that's early part of next year, but...

1254
01:21:18,152 --> 01:21:23,676
[SPEAKER_13]: You still have stuff coming out for a while on there because not everyone's going to pick up.

1255
01:21:23,956 --> 01:21:24,856
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just like the Wii.

1256
01:21:24,876 --> 01:21:26,297
[SPEAKER_13]: The Wii's still going to have some stuff coming out.

1257
01:21:26,537 --> 01:21:29,339
[SPEAKER_13]: Not anything from Nintendo, but they're going to have a few things.

1258
01:21:29,619 --> 01:21:31,520
[SPEAKER_15]: Interesting comment from TigerClaw in the chat room.

1259
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:32,440
[SPEAKER_15]: What about the Ouya?

1260
01:21:32,781 --> 01:21:34,642
[SPEAKER_15]: You would also have to deal with that when it comes out.

1261
01:21:34,722 --> 01:21:36,443
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, the Ouya's kind of its own little thing.

1262
01:21:36,503 --> 01:21:42,066
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think any of the other guys are taking the Ouya seriously because the Ouya is such a grassroots homebrew thing.

1263
01:21:43,046 --> 01:21:48,368
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, oh, that little basement, that kid's basement toy, I honestly think that's how they view it.

1264
01:21:48,669 --> 01:21:52,170
[SPEAKER_15]: Because what's the Wii going to do for the gaming experience?

1265
01:21:52,230 --> 01:21:54,791
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it really going to push the gaming experience further?

1266
01:21:55,551 --> 01:21:57,052
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's just going to open up.

1267
01:21:57,112 --> 01:21:59,693
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to be like the most indie-friendly thing you've ever seen.

1268
01:21:59,893 --> 01:22:05,237
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just going to be kind of similar to like how Steam, I mean, because it's kind of the way Steam's trying to go too.

1269
01:22:05,257 --> 01:22:22,470
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, they have the whole Steam Greenlight stuff to try and get your indie games on their marketplace, and then Steam Big Picture, so they kind of want to sell you a box, which they may eventually do, you know, they will eventually sell you a box that you can hook up to your TV and you just get all the Steam stuff with a controller and away you go, which would be fantastic.

1270
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:23,591
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have a problem with that, but...

1271
01:22:24,151 --> 01:22:47,271
[SPEAKER_13]: I think OUYA is trying to do something similar to that where they have got the box that they sell you which is really tiny which is awesome and then of course all these games are going to be kind of exclusive to it because they're mobile games for the most part and you'll just have to see how it takes off I don't think it's going to be huge it's not going to all of a sudden just take over the Wii or anything like that it's not going to happen it'll be like a

1272
01:22:47,691 --> 01:22:48,172
[SPEAKER_15]: Roku.

1273
01:22:48,472 --> 01:22:51,975
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of people have them, but not everybody's talking about them.

1274
01:22:52,276 --> 01:22:59,023
[SPEAKER_13]: Unless, you know, and it's obviously the Wii U doesn't have anything like this, but let's just say that, you know...

1275
01:23:00,228 --> 01:23:08,031
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's just say that one day they decide, hey, you know what, we're going to make it so all these games that you buy from us, yeah, you can't trade them in anymore.

1276
01:23:08,211 --> 01:23:12,272
[SPEAKER_13]: Or in the next consoles that come out, hey, by the way, all these games are going to be tied to your console.

1277
01:23:12,693 --> 01:23:14,813
[SPEAKER_13]: Then something like that may be able to take off.

1278
01:23:14,853 --> 01:23:18,875
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm seeing on Twitter that your Nintendo Network ID is tied to that console.

1279
01:23:18,915 --> 01:23:19,715
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't move it.

1280
01:23:20,095 --> 01:23:23,036
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, I'm seeing a lot of rage on Twitter about that.

1281
01:23:23,236 --> 01:23:27,698
[SPEAKER_15]: I kind of think that's that whole, we just haven't built how to move it yet concept.

1282
01:23:29,059 --> 01:23:33,364
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm giving Nintendo the benefit of the doubt that they just haven't freaking built that in yet.

1283
01:23:33,729 --> 01:23:38,172
[SPEAKER_13]: Once again, reiterating what we've been saying for months now, they don't fucking get online.

1284
01:23:38,372 --> 01:23:42,475
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, they have something that resembles online right now, but they still don't fucking understand it.

1285
01:23:42,575 --> 01:23:45,757
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's a real... They're making it up as they go along.

1286
01:23:45,797 --> 01:23:48,459
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a real bad... I mean, come on.

1287
01:23:49,139 --> 01:24:02,188
[SPEAKER_13]: This is... How late into the game are we getting into an actual functioning online and you still haven't figured... I mean, this is... This is shit that they were fucking up years ago and now they're just... I don't know.

1288
01:24:02,388 --> 01:24:03,569
[SPEAKER_13]: It's amateur shit.

1289
01:24:05,095 --> 01:24:08,027
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, DarkSakura, what do you have for us before we get to release dates?

1290
01:24:08,672 --> 01:24:10,213
[SPEAKER_07]: I have stuff and things.

1291
01:24:10,794 --> 01:24:14,476
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm sure people were interested in Black Ops 2.

1292
01:24:15,117 --> 01:24:18,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Although when one of my friends posted about it as BO2, I was like, Body Odor 2?

1293
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:20,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's really about as much as I care about Black Ops.

1294
01:24:21,201 --> 01:24:23,243
[SPEAKER_07]: But they did something really awesomely stupid.

1295
01:24:24,304 --> 01:24:32,109
[SPEAKER_07]: On the installation disk, it has the data for Mass Effect 2 on it instead.

1296
01:24:32,570 --> 01:24:34,191
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're getting a much better game.

1297
01:24:36,755 --> 01:24:36,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Black Ops 2

1298
01:24:50,376 --> 01:24:58,899
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, I heard something, and I don't know if this ended up being true or not, but I heard something about that this was being caused because these people actually already... Oh, it's PC copies, by the way.

1299
01:24:59,220 --> 01:24:59,340
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1300
01:24:59,640 --> 01:25:10,264
[SPEAKER_15]: These people already had Mass Effect 2 installed on their PCs, and Mass Effect 2 had the lock on some type of file extension that Call of Duty was also, or Black Ops was also trying to use.

1301
01:25:10,624 --> 01:25:13,545
[SPEAKER_15]: And so when Black Ops would call up the file, Mass Effect was loading.

1302
01:25:14,085 --> 01:25:16,947
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, it seems like it's only happening to people that already had Mass Effect 2.

1303
01:25:18,047 --> 01:25:18,827
[SPEAKER_15]: At least that's what I'm hearing.

1304
01:25:18,867 --> 01:25:21,328
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if that panned out or whatever, but I know that was from the newer score.

1305
01:25:21,469 --> 01:25:23,850
[SPEAKER_07]: It happened specifically with the second installation disc.

1306
01:25:24,770 --> 01:25:25,390
[SPEAKER_15]: That's weird.

1307
01:25:25,650 --> 01:25:26,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1308
01:25:27,651 --> 01:25:35,175
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like people on Steam, Reddit, 4chan, they don't know who listens to 4chan anymore, and the Black Ops forums were complaining about it.

1309
01:25:35,575 --> 01:25:37,095
[SPEAKER_13]: It can also be a pressing issue.

1310
01:25:38,436 --> 01:25:45,759
[SPEAKER_13]: They're all duplicated, a few duplicators, and if it just happens that they're pressing copies of Mass Effect 2 and some of those happen to get in there.

1311
01:25:45,999 --> 01:25:47,360
[SPEAKER_07]: Activision hasn't said shit about it, so

1312
01:25:47,682 --> 01:25:52,047
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, which is funny, yeah, because that would mean Activision and EA are using the same presser.

1313
01:25:52,688 --> 01:25:53,529
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, they do.

1314
01:25:54,290 --> 01:25:59,616
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, Technicolor, they press discs for the movie industry, for everything.

1315
01:26:00,037 --> 01:26:04,963
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, there's only a few duplicators that are out there, and aside from Nintendo actually doing carts and stuff, but...

1316
01:26:07,866 --> 01:26:11,228
[SPEAKER_13]: These all get duplicated at a few duplicators around the world.

1317
01:26:11,488 --> 01:26:13,069
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just whoever they decide to use.

1318
01:26:13,930 --> 01:26:19,534
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very possible that they get stuff that maybe another company is using.

1319
01:26:20,614 --> 01:26:25,898
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's travel around the world and look at release dates and see what's coming to a game store near you this week.

1320
01:26:26,471 --> 01:26:30,493
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, this week we've got, it's starting to slow down a little bit, so we've got a few things.

1321
01:26:30,574 --> 01:26:43,201
[SPEAKER_13]: Rise of the Guardians coming out on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, the Wii, the DS, the 3DS, and yeah.

1322
01:26:43,762 --> 01:26:48,144
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the 3DS version of Pro Evo Soccer 2013, although I think that date's wrong.

1323
01:26:48,264 --> 01:26:50,866
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe that's actually coming out next year, if I remember correctly.

1324
01:26:51,366 --> 01:27:13,000
[SPEAKER_13]: Adventure Time, Hey Ice King, Why'd You Steal Our Garbage on 3DS and DS, also collector's editions for those, Hitman Absolution on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Persona 4 Golden on the Vita, PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale on the PS3 and the Vita, also, let's see what else we got here,

1325
01:27:14,346 --> 01:27:15,067
[SPEAKER_13]: Scribblenauts Unlimited on PC

1326
01:27:38,155 --> 01:27:56,117
[SPEAKER_13]: PC version came out a little bit later and everything else and Family Guy Back to the Multiverse on PS3 and 360 and kids learn and play Pets and Vets I think that's a re-release the thermometer goes in the butt

1327
01:27:58,417 --> 01:28:00,719
[SPEAKER_13]: and Assassin's Creed 3 on PC.

1328
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:02,681
[SPEAKER_13]: And that, I believe, is it?

1329
01:28:02,701 --> 01:28:03,722
[SPEAKER_13]: What the hell is this?

1330
01:28:03,943 --> 01:28:04,904
[SPEAKER_13]: Kids learn and play.

1331
01:28:05,664 --> 01:28:08,287
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like a bundle, but I have never seen these.

1332
01:28:09,068 --> 01:28:12,070
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah, it's some value games.

1333
01:28:12,671 --> 01:28:13,051
[SPEAKER_13]: It's crap.

1334
01:28:13,091 --> 01:28:13,432
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't buy it.

1335
01:28:15,794 --> 01:28:17,915
[SPEAKER_15]: That in-depth review brought to you by Loki.

1336
01:28:17,976 --> 01:28:18,236
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1337
01:28:19,096 --> 01:28:22,398
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's go to the Japanese release dates and what's coming out over there.

1338
01:28:22,459 --> 01:28:32,225
[SPEAKER_15]: On November 22nd on the Xbox 360, Doom 3, the BFG edition, as well as Call of Duty Black Ops 2, this is the version with subtitles, is released in Japan.

1339
01:28:32,265 --> 01:28:38,049
[SPEAKER_15]: There's also an Xbox Live special membership card to celebrate the Call of Duty release in Japan.

1340
01:28:39,350 --> 01:28:43,012
[SPEAKER_15]: On the PlayStation 3, Call of Duty Black Ops 2 is out there as well.

1341
01:28:43,052 --> 01:28:43,933
[SPEAKER_15]: Same with Doom 3.

1342
01:28:44,033 --> 01:28:45,214
[SPEAKER_15]: There's some more stuff, though, as well.

1343
01:28:45,774 --> 01:28:47,275
[SPEAKER_15]: Some games getting price reductions.

1344
01:28:47,395 --> 01:28:50,996
[SPEAKER_15]: Grand Theft Auto 4, Infamous 2, Killzone 3, LittleBigPlanet 2.

1345
01:28:51,136 --> 01:28:52,417
[SPEAKER_15]: All of them getting price reductions.

1346
01:28:52,797 --> 01:28:59,019
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as new games go on the PlayStation 3, Mina No Golf 6, EX Troopers, Chaos Head.

1347
01:28:59,039 --> 01:29:00,200
[SPEAKER_07]: That's everybody's golf.

1348
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:07,562
[SPEAKER_15]: Chaos Head Love Choo Choo and Chaos Head Noah as well as a double pack of both games are out there as well.

1349
01:29:08,203 --> 01:29:08,343
[SPEAKER_15]: And...

1350
01:29:09,844 --> 01:29:17,775
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what that is?

1351
01:29:18,536 --> 01:29:19,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Space Battleship Yamato?

1352
01:29:19,798 --> 01:29:20,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

1353
01:29:20,358 --> 01:29:21,560
[SPEAKER_07]: In other words, Starblazers?

1354
01:29:22,481 --> 01:29:22,602
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh.

1355
01:29:22,802 --> 01:29:26,207
[SPEAKER_15]: Luxury limited edition and regular edition in Japan this week.

1356
01:29:27,663 --> 01:29:34,789
[SPEAKER_15]: and a classic white slim console comes out if you need to get your Japanese PlayStation 3.

1357
01:29:36,210 --> 01:29:38,872
[SPEAKER_15]: Looking at the other systems real quick, let me check on the Vita.

1358
01:29:39,693 --> 01:29:44,576
[SPEAKER_15]: There's just another 3G Wi-Fi pack out this week that has Mineno Golf 6 with it.

1359
01:29:45,157 --> 01:29:46,258
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's that, yay.

1360
01:29:47,118 --> 01:29:48,098
[SPEAKER_15]: on the 3DS.

1361
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:50,439
[SPEAKER_15]: EX Troopers is out there as well.

1362
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:55,921
[SPEAKER_15]: On the 23rd, Pokemon Fushigi no Dungeon.

1363
01:29:56,101 --> 01:29:58,002
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm assuming that's the Pokemon Dungeon Crawler game.

1364
01:29:58,642 --> 01:29:59,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Fushigi is mysterious.

1365
01:30:00,182 --> 01:30:04,084
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I keep wanting to say Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon, but it's a Pokemon game.

1366
01:30:04,104 --> 01:30:05,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Pokemon Mysterious Dungeon.

1367
01:30:05,084 --> 01:30:06,504
[SPEAKER_15]: Pikachu's Mysterious Dungeon or whatever.

1368
01:30:08,866 --> 01:30:16,028
[SPEAKER_15]: Ochi, Manichi, Tamagotchi on the 3DS because Tamagotchi, yes, is still a thing, believe it or not.

1369
01:30:16,348 --> 01:30:20,769
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I saw Furbies at Toys R Us the other day, so what's old is new again.

1370
01:30:20,869 --> 01:30:22,169
[SPEAKER_07]: I blocked Furby on Facebook.

1371
01:30:22,829 --> 01:30:33,371
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, the Wii U, keep in mind, not out over there in Japan until December the 8th, so we don't have those release dates for a little bit, but we'll work those into the rotation soon.

1372
01:30:33,771 --> 01:30:36,892
[SPEAKER_15]: Otherwise, we'll go to Jamie for what's coming out in the UK.

1373
01:30:37,702 --> 01:30:38,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Some stuff.

1374
01:30:38,743 --> 01:30:39,023
[SPEAKER_07]: The end.

1375
01:30:39,083 --> 01:30:39,444
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm kidding.

1376
01:30:40,344 --> 01:30:47,731
[SPEAKER_07]: On the 18th, Epic Mickey 2, Power of Illusion, and The Power of Two, Udraw Studio.

1377
01:30:48,051 --> 01:30:51,954
[SPEAKER_07]: On the 20th, we have Hitman Absolution, Planetside, Next.

1378
01:30:52,234 --> 01:30:54,256
[SPEAKER_07]: 21st, The Walking Dead, Episode 5, No Time Left.

1379
01:30:55,397 --> 01:31:01,142
[SPEAKER_07]: 23rd, Assassin's Creed 3, Rise of the Guardians, Talisman Prologue.

1380
01:31:02,243 --> 01:31:03,044
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's it.

1381
01:31:04,522 --> 01:31:08,865
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, just a few more stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.

1382
01:31:09,245 --> 01:31:10,686
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think we've got some Sony news.

1383
01:31:10,746 --> 01:31:13,208
[SPEAKER_15]: We've talked Nintendo, we've talked Microsoft, but Loki?

1384
01:31:13,868 --> 01:31:21,593
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, they're finally, well, they announced already that PlayStation Plus would be coming to the Vita, and they've now announced which day it's going to be coming out.

1385
01:31:21,613 --> 01:31:23,574
[SPEAKER_13]: It's going to be coming out tomorrow, on the November 19th.

1386
01:31:24,194 --> 01:31:29,558
[SPEAKER_13]: And what's kind of awesome with that is they're also adding some games to the Instant Game Collection that will be available for the Vita.

1387
01:31:30,338 --> 01:31:52,417
[SPEAKER_13]: and this includes some full Vita games including Uncharted, Golden Abyss, Jet Set Radio which is actually set to come out next week, Wipeout 2048, Gravity Rush, Tales from Space, Mutant Blobs Attack and I guess Final Fantasy Tactics, The War of the Lions that was a PSP title and that's

1388
01:31:52,837 --> 01:31:53,277
[SPEAKER_13]: Not bad.

1389
01:31:53,678 --> 01:31:59,161
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, PlayStation Plus, $18 for three months or $50 for the full year.

1390
01:31:59,361 --> 01:32:12,248
[SPEAKER_13]: And I guess, obviously, if you have a PlayStation Plus membership, you also get all the free wonderful games library stuff with the PS3 and the one gigabyte of cloud storage, which is pretty awesome.

1391
01:32:12,668 --> 01:32:14,429
[SPEAKER_13]: And I guess a gigabyte of cloud storage on the Vita.

1392
01:32:14,489 --> 01:32:15,950
[SPEAKER_13]: I wonder if that's the same one gigabyte.

1393
01:32:16,711 --> 01:32:19,012
[SPEAKER_16]: Is your Vita actually going to come out of storage now at this point?

1394
01:32:19,488 --> 01:32:20,368
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, it's in my backpack.

1395
01:32:20,668 --> 01:32:22,449
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it going to come out of your backpack?

1396
01:32:23,909 --> 01:32:28,931
[SPEAKER_13]: No, because I have to actually become a member of PlayStation Plus and I just don't want to right now.

1397
01:32:29,251 --> 01:32:30,051
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm excited.

1398
01:32:30,151 --> 01:32:32,872
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm PlayStation Plus and I couldn't be more excited about this.

1399
01:32:32,952 --> 01:32:35,533
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, oh my god, it's like Christmas on my Vita tomorrow.

1400
01:32:35,573 --> 01:32:36,373
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to be great.

1401
01:32:36,913 --> 01:32:38,653
[SPEAKER_15]: So yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

1402
01:32:38,934 --> 01:32:40,554
[SPEAKER_15]: Vita's relevance is finally starting to come out.

1403
01:32:41,587 --> 01:32:42,628
[SPEAKER_15]: Just in time for the holidays.

1404
01:32:43,669 --> 01:32:50,093
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, well, also coming to the Vita, I think this is also tomorrow with the PlayStation Plus update, obviously.

1405
01:32:50,633 --> 01:32:52,515
[SPEAKER_15]: A whole new firmware, 2.0.

1406
01:32:53,395 --> 01:32:55,897
[SPEAKER_15]: A new email application for the Vita.

1407
01:32:55,917 --> 01:33:01,101
[SPEAKER_15]: That's kind of interesting, but, well, it makes the 3G a little more lucrative, especially if you don't have a phone that does it.

1408
01:33:01,261 --> 01:33:02,202
[SPEAKER_16]: With the coolest...

1409
01:33:02,962 --> 01:33:04,343
[SPEAKER_16]: PlayStation's typing interface.

1410
01:33:05,223 --> 01:33:06,964
[SPEAKER_16]: I get what they're doing.

1411
01:33:08,565 --> 01:33:10,346
[SPEAKER_15]: It's easier to use than iPhone, honestly.

1412
01:33:10,906 --> 01:33:11,346
[SPEAKER_15]: I think so.

1413
01:33:12,226 --> 01:33:12,807
[SPEAKER_15]: On the Vita?

1414
01:33:13,147 --> 01:33:13,767
[SPEAKER_15]: Heck yeah.

1415
01:33:14,768 --> 01:33:19,510
[SPEAKER_16]: It's easier to have the key directly instead of having to memorize what it's under.

1416
01:33:21,251 --> 01:33:23,594
[SPEAKER_16]: The Vita has that tanky style mode.

1417
01:33:23,615 --> 01:33:28,621
[SPEAKER_15]: You can type on the keyboard and it's really responsive and fits a large part of the screen.

1418
01:33:28,641 --> 01:33:29,963
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, the Vita is a touchscreen, isn't it?

1419
01:33:30,243 --> 01:33:31,425
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, disregard.

1420
01:33:31,465 --> 01:33:36,492
[SPEAKER_15]: You're thinking about Sony's PlayStation 3 predictive text, which the Vita will do as well.

1421
01:33:37,113 --> 01:33:37,874
[SPEAKER_15]: So it has that.

1422
01:33:38,334 --> 01:33:39,335
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll be over here if you need me.

1423
01:33:40,617 --> 01:33:41,679
[SPEAKER_15]: That's alright.

1424
01:33:41,779 --> 01:33:47,987
[SPEAKER_15]: Gmail, Yahoo, and other miscellaneous providers unsaid will be supported.

1425
01:33:48,808 --> 01:33:51,732
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, finally, this is so dumb that they didn't have this before.

1426
01:33:52,213 --> 01:33:55,798
[SPEAKER_15]: Wirelessly transmit between the PC and the Vita.

1427
01:33:56,338 --> 01:34:02,723
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, browser and video apps will now do 1080p videos even though it's not like it's going to magically change the output.

1428
01:34:02,763 --> 01:34:05,445
[SPEAKER_13]: What about wireless transmitting between the PS3 and the Vita?

1429
01:34:06,045 --> 01:34:10,448
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not said, but I would think if it's wireless between the PC, why not?

1430
01:34:10,488 --> 01:34:11,989
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I think it would be on the PlayStation 3.

1431
01:34:12,089 --> 01:34:15,051
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to say I read that somewhere else that it will do that too.

1432
01:34:15,111 --> 01:34:15,732
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank God.

1433
01:34:16,312 --> 01:34:17,573
[SPEAKER_15]: Makes so much more sense.

1434
01:34:18,234 --> 01:34:19,715
[SPEAKER_15]: So, very cool.

1435
01:34:19,955 --> 01:34:22,276
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all coming as well this week.

1436
01:34:23,177 --> 01:34:24,517
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura is taking it back this week.

1437
01:34:46,707 --> 01:34:47,207
[SPEAKER_07]: I am.

1438
01:34:47,788 --> 01:34:51,989
[SPEAKER_07]: The game of the week is Yars' Revenge for the Atari 2600.

1439
01:34:52,570 --> 01:34:54,110
[SPEAKER_16]: Yars, not Yaris.

1440
01:34:56,211 --> 01:34:57,292
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a great pick.

1441
01:34:57,832 --> 01:35:09,297
[SPEAKER_13]: It's also a game that particularly illustrates the proper way to use an apostrophe with something that ends in an S. Although, to be honest, if they were ever going to make a second Yars game, Yars' Revenge would be kind of fun to play.

1442
01:35:10,396 --> 01:35:11,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Be like Christine.

1443
01:35:12,417 --> 01:35:15,338
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, words that don't seem to be ours.

1444
01:35:15,438 --> 01:35:15,978
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway.

1445
01:35:16,598 --> 01:35:24,742
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, it came out in 1982 and it was created by Howard Scott Warshall who wrote Raiders of the Lost Ark and E.T.

1446
01:35:26,246 --> 01:35:28,047
[SPEAKER_07]: But we forgive him because of Yars' Revenge.

1447
01:35:28,067 --> 01:35:28,907
[SPEAKER_15]: That's right.

1448
01:35:29,047 --> 01:35:31,428
[SPEAKER_15]: For every bad game he made, there was a good game.

1449
01:35:31,528 --> 01:35:34,509
[SPEAKER_15]: And let's not forget he was under tremendous pressure with E.T.

1450
01:35:35,009 --> 01:35:36,049
[SPEAKER_15]: Read his side of it.

1451
01:35:36,149 --> 01:35:37,890
[SPEAKER_15]: You'll feel a lot of sympathy for the guy.

1452
01:35:37,930 --> 01:35:42,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Which isn't that like the plot of the Angry Video Game Nerds movie now?

1453
01:35:42,691 --> 01:35:45,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Trying to find where all the cartridges of E.T.

1454
01:35:45,232 --> 01:35:45,332
[SPEAKER_07]: are?

1455
01:35:45,392 --> 01:35:45,892
[SPEAKER_15]: Who cares?

1456
01:35:46,012 --> 01:35:47,253
[SPEAKER_15]: I care about the real story.

1457
01:35:47,293 --> 01:35:47,753
[SPEAKER_07]: No offense.

1458
01:35:48,473 --> 01:36:00,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, anyway, it was supposed to be a licensed port of a game called Star Castle, which there's a cannon that's protected by these counter-rotating shields, and you have to shoot holes in the shields to destroy the cannon inside.

1459
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:04,162
[SPEAKER_07]: But then again, once you shoot the holes, the cannon can shoot you.

1460
01:36:05,302 --> 01:36:05,923
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um...

1461
01:36:07,099 --> 01:36:08,380
[SPEAKER_15]: Kill or be killed.

1462
01:36:09,500 --> 01:36:15,223
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, so as they were developing the Atari version, it actually changed quite a bit.

1463
01:36:15,663 --> 01:36:29,410
[SPEAKER_07]: So now your hero is called a yar, which is like a little insect thing that nibbles through the layer, and then it can shoot his cannon into the breach and kill the evil Kotile, which I think is how it was said.

1464
01:36:30,551 --> 01:36:31,711
[SPEAKER_07]: who is on the other side of the barrier.

1465
01:36:32,712 --> 01:36:42,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Although you can be shot at through the barrier, and it turns into a swirl.

1466
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:48,824
[SPEAKER_07]: However, you're warned before you get shot at, and you can go back to the other side of the little energy wall.

1467
01:36:49,684 --> 01:36:53,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, I swear the first time I saw that I was like, is my TV fucked up?

1468
01:36:54,335 --> 01:36:56,396
[SPEAKER_07]: but no, it's a party game.

1469
01:36:56,456 --> 01:36:57,857
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also a little safe zone.

1470
01:36:57,937 --> 01:37:00,098
[SPEAKER_07]: The neutral zone.

1471
01:37:00,318 --> 01:37:04,360
[SPEAKER_07]: The swirls can get you but the little torpedoes cannot and you cannot shoot from within the neutral zone.

1472
01:37:05,996 --> 01:37:21,840
[SPEAKER_07]: So you've got different scoring, and the highest thing you can get is if you shoot one of those swirls in mid-air with the Zorlon Cannon, which is this little shooty thing, you get 6,000 points and an extra life, but you can get only up to 9 lives.

1473
01:37:22,601 --> 01:37:27,002
[SPEAKER_07]: And each level ends when you kill the Kotyl or the swirl.

1474
01:37:28,002 --> 01:37:36,345
[SPEAKER_07]: So, uh, basically when you reach 70,000 points, the shield will turn blue, and the swirls come out with more frequency.

1475
01:37:36,465 --> 01:37:46,409
[SPEAKER_07]: If you get 150,000, the shield turns gray, and, you know, even more crap comes out, and you get a guided missile, it's gonna get ya.

1476
01:37:46,429 --> 01:37:54,633
[SPEAKER_07]: 230,000 points, the shield turns pink, and the swirls will begin to fire three times more frequently, and not give you warnings.

1477
01:37:55,333 --> 01:37:56,655
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a comic book that came out with it.

1478
01:37:57,215 --> 01:38:09,789
[SPEAKER_07]: It had a mini comic book that was in the game package and it gave the story behind the game and why it was seeking vengeance because apparently the thingy blew up their world.

1479
01:38:11,579 --> 01:38:12,779
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there was an album.

1480
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:16,601
[SPEAKER_07]: It had a theme song and a radio drama of the comic book.

1481
01:38:17,621 --> 01:38:18,341
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was kind of neat.

1482
01:38:18,361 --> 01:38:20,922
[SPEAKER_07]: There's also an Easter egg in the game.

1483
01:38:21,002 --> 01:38:27,004
[SPEAKER_07]: If you kill a swirl in midair, a black vertical line appears on the screen across the spot where the swirl was shot.

1484
01:38:28,544 --> 01:38:34,049
[SPEAKER_07]: The line is referred to in the manual as Ghost of Yars and warns the player to stay off the mean streak.

1485
01:38:34,589 --> 01:38:48,400
[SPEAKER_07]: If the player moves vertically along that line and is about 1-2 inches below the middle of the screen when the explosion closes, the game will end and go into a game select screen with the programmer's initials HSW that's forward and backwards on the word select.

1486
01:38:49,941 --> 01:38:54,625
[SPEAKER_07]: If you do it in game 6 or 7, JOV appears which is under the creator's initials.

1487
01:38:55,285 --> 01:38:58,668
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a remake for the Game Boy Color in 1999.

1488
01:38:59,108 --> 01:39:03,031
[SPEAKER_07]: In 2005, of course, it came out on the Atari Flashback 2.

1489
01:39:03,651 --> 01:39:06,093
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a 3 and 1 that came on the GBA in 2005.

1490
01:39:07,314 --> 01:39:09,576
[SPEAKER_07]: And that also came with Pong and Asteroids.

1491
01:39:10,376 --> 01:39:11,837
[SPEAKER_07]: It's available on Game Room in 2010.

1492
01:39:11,897 --> 01:39:15,540
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a reimagining that came out on Xbox Live Arcade.

1493
01:39:17,702 --> 01:39:20,744
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, I think it's not out yet on PS3.

1494
01:39:20,764 --> 01:39:21,925
[SPEAKER_07]: They said they were going to be doing it.

1495
01:39:22,842 --> 01:39:23,663
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1496
01:39:42,756 --> 01:39:45,679
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's supposed to be a lot more like the 2600 game.

1497
01:39:45,719 --> 01:39:46,360
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't played it.

1498
01:39:47,341 --> 01:39:55,390
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's another one that's free on browsers that supports HTML5 that is on Atari.com with other classic Atari games.

1499
01:39:56,371 --> 01:40:00,856
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a sequel called Yar's Return that's on the Atari Flashback too.

1500
01:40:01,437 --> 01:40:01,697
[SPEAKER_07]: The end.

1501
01:40:02,725 --> 01:40:04,005
[SPEAKER_15]: There it is, your classic game of the week.

1502
01:40:04,065 --> 01:40:06,746
[SPEAKER_15]: A real classic going way back to the Atari 2600.

1503
01:40:06,846 --> 01:40:08,087
[SPEAKER_15]: Yars' Revenge.

1504
01:40:08,267 --> 01:40:10,688
[SPEAKER_15]: Undoubtedly one of the best 2600 games they ever did.

1505
01:40:11,988 --> 01:40:12,548
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.

1506
01:40:13,129 --> 01:40:13,569
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1507
01:40:13,609 --> 01:40:14,929
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we are going to take a break, guys.

1508
01:40:14,949 --> 01:40:30,235
[SPEAKER_15]: When we come back, we've got more of Orange Laundry to come, including rapid-fire news, the Google Question of the Week, some other gaming-related news, and a hilarious follow-up to something I said last week would probably not go away anytime soon.

1509
01:40:30,255 --> 01:40:30,615
[SPEAKER_10]: The futures!

1510
01:40:31,356 --> 01:40:32,038
[SPEAKER_15]: It's really funny.

1511
01:40:32,058 --> 01:40:36,209
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll get to that in just a little bit when we come back with more of Orange Lounge Radio.

1512
01:40:43,548 --> 01:40:52,114
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live with episode number 482 of our show for this November the 18th of 2012.

1513
01:40:52,914 --> 01:40:57,517
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to get into some rapid fire news, but first I got to ask Loki.

1514
01:40:57,577 --> 01:40:58,338
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki's over there.

1515
01:40:58,758 --> 01:41:01,920
[SPEAKER_15]: He's like, all right, let me touch the Wii U tablet.

1516
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:04,121
[SPEAKER_07]: He's going to touch the Wii.

1517
01:41:04,882 --> 01:41:06,623
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, Loki, touch the Wii U tablet.

1518
01:41:07,351 --> 01:41:07,912
[SPEAKER_15]: I like it.

1519
01:41:08,072 --> 01:41:14,376
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it has a good, for such a big frickin' thing, it's got a really nice feel to it.

1520
01:41:15,257 --> 01:41:22,822
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, I mean, as far as the placements of the analog sticks, they're comfortable, but hitting, like, the buttons below it is not quite comfortable.

1521
01:41:23,262 --> 01:41:34,670
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, if you're trying to hit the A, like, the A button, if there was a game that you were using, you know, like First Versus Shooters and stuff, where the A button might be used, that is a bit, you know, that could cramp up your hand pretty bad.

1522
01:41:34,830 --> 01:41:38,491
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what's strange about that?

1523
01:41:40,291 --> 01:41:47,473
[SPEAKER_16]: I felt that in the menus, and I think this might be more related to the Xbox 360 controller since they just flipped where the buttons are.

1524
01:41:47,933 --> 01:41:54,555
[SPEAKER_16]: I kind of noticed that problem in the menus, but the couple of games that I was playing through didn't really have finger placement issues.

1525
01:41:56,875 --> 01:42:06,937
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, if you want to follow me on Miiverse, again, I said this quickly in the first part of the show, but if you did pick up a Wii U and you want to follow me on Miiverse, my name on the Wii, really creative, y'all, Rob Roberts.

1526
01:42:07,698 --> 01:42:08,218
[SPEAKER_15]: All one word.

1527
01:42:08,918 --> 01:42:09,158
[SPEAKER_15]: I know.

1528
01:42:09,478 --> 01:42:10,298
[SPEAKER_15]: Really tough to figure out.

1529
01:42:10,938 --> 01:42:11,218
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1530
01:42:11,658 --> 01:42:18,540
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's travel through some rapid-fire news and talk quickly about what else is going on in the gaming world.

1531
01:42:18,620 --> 01:42:19,300
[SPEAKER_15]: Not just a Wii.

1532
01:42:21,454 --> 01:42:23,336
[SPEAKER_13]: StarCraft II, Heart of the Swarm

1533
01:42:41,915 --> 01:42:49,003
[SPEAKER_13]: and of course the Digital Deluxe and Collector's Edition version will be available as well priced at $59.99 and $79.99 respectively.

1534
01:42:50,264 --> 01:43:00,516
[SPEAKER_13]: And the Digital Deluxe version like anything else that is Blizzard will contain stuff that doesn't necessarily apply to the game that you're buying which doesn't make any fucking sense to me.

1535
01:43:01,096 --> 01:43:14,890
[SPEAKER_13]: You get a pet for World of Warcraft and a new sigil for Diablo 3 Someone explain this to me Why the fuck would I buy a collector's edition for one game to get shit for another game?

1536
01:43:14,910 --> 01:43:18,894
[SPEAKER_13]: That doesn't make any goddamn sense Because you're already playing the other game, especially WoW

1537
01:43:19,494 --> 01:43:22,155
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a lot of Blizzard crossover in the fandom.

1538
01:43:22,515 --> 01:43:30,796
[SPEAKER_15]: I would say there's more synergy within that fandom than almost any other type of company with the exception of maybe Squeenix.

1539
01:43:31,456 --> 01:43:32,296
[SPEAKER_15]: Pre-Eidos.

1540
01:43:32,597 --> 01:43:34,977
[SPEAKER_07]: And you can get StarCraft Pets in WoW.

1541
01:43:35,437 --> 01:43:37,077
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, there's a lot of that crossover.

1542
01:43:37,137 --> 01:43:39,498
[SPEAKER_15]: But Sigils, really?

1543
01:43:40,338 --> 01:43:40,738
[SPEAKER_15]: Really?

1544
01:43:41,778 --> 01:43:42,718
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a bit of a stretch.

1545
01:43:43,519 --> 01:43:44,439
[SPEAKER_16]: But what else are they going to give you?

1546
01:43:44,499 --> 01:43:45,559
[SPEAKER_16]: A freaking legendary drop?

1547
01:43:46,064 --> 01:43:46,544
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1548
01:43:46,604 --> 01:43:49,045
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's just kind of dumb that they have that.

1549
01:43:49,625 --> 01:43:53,946
[SPEAKER_13]: Behind the scenes DVD slash Blu-ray and soundtrack.

1550
01:43:54,106 --> 01:43:57,827
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, Heart of the Swarm hardcover art book and Zerg Rush mouse pad.

1551
01:43:58,908 --> 01:44:00,148
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me put it this way, okay?

1552
01:44:01,128 --> 01:44:04,449
[SPEAKER_13]: Rational people out there, just don't fucking buy the collector's edition.

1553
01:44:04,489 --> 01:44:10,711
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't need to spend $40 extra for a pet in WoW and a goddamn mouse pad.

1554
01:44:11,391 --> 01:44:12,572
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not just...

1555
01:44:14,012 --> 01:44:14,612
[SPEAKER_13]: Resist.

1556
01:44:14,973 --> 01:44:15,653
[SPEAKER_13]: You can do it.

1557
01:44:15,813 --> 01:44:16,693
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, seriously.

1558
01:44:17,534 --> 01:44:19,955
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you are an addict and bought it, give me the pet.

1559
01:44:21,255 --> 01:44:24,637
[SPEAKER_16]: I would be glad to give you mine because otherwise the code will be completely unredeemed.

1560
01:44:25,878 --> 01:44:26,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1561
01:44:26,398 --> 01:44:29,219
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you have the one from the original StarCraft 2 release?

1562
01:44:29,359 --> 01:44:29,799
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I do not.

1563
01:44:29,879 --> 01:44:30,079
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1564
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:31,720
[SPEAKER_16]: I will send that your way when I get home.

1565
01:44:32,300 --> 01:44:32,761
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1566
01:44:33,281 --> 01:44:34,101
[SPEAKER_07]: So I win.

1567
01:44:34,241 --> 01:44:34,701
[SPEAKER_07]: I win.

1568
01:44:34,782 --> 01:44:35,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, you can't have it.

1569
01:44:35,542 --> 01:44:36,983
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, you're making food and not in the room.

1570
01:44:37,323 --> 01:44:37,903
[SPEAKER_16]: Disqualified.

1571
01:44:40,590 --> 01:44:45,432
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale comes out next week, and they've already announced their first bit of DLC.

1572
01:44:45,492 --> 01:44:46,152
[SPEAKER_13]: What, D?

1573
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:47,553
[SPEAKER_13]: Early DLC?

1574
01:44:47,633 --> 01:44:48,493
[SPEAKER_13]: What the fuck?

1575
01:44:48,633 --> 01:44:48,933
[SPEAKER_13]: Why?

1576
01:44:49,033 --> 01:44:49,833
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not paying for DLC.

1577
01:44:49,953 --> 01:44:51,934
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, good, you don't have to, because it's actually free.

1578
01:44:52,454 --> 01:45:06,159
[SPEAKER_13]: And the two characters they're going to be adding to the roster include, um, Kat, who is from Gravity Rush, the Vita game, and, um, I guess Emmett Graves, who is the character from Starhawk.

1579
01:45:06,619 --> 01:45:32,772
[SPEAKER_13]: and what's kind of cool is apparently the unique gameplay styles from both of those games are going to cross over into it including Kat's ability to manipulate gravity and Emmet's ability to kind of call the support stuff from Starhawk the build as you kind of go type thing so that's pretty neat and free DLC is always awesome and it's kind of cool to see if they're going to be expanding this game so

1580
01:45:34,452 --> 01:45:43,175
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe when the Game of the Year edition comes out with all the characters and they're making certain picking it up, but still pretty neat.

1581
01:45:43,315 --> 01:45:51,939
[SPEAKER_13]: And last but not least, and I've actually used this company before, FigurePrints is actually doing something now with Minecraft where you can actually export a part of your world

1582
01:45:52,879 --> 01:45:55,261
[SPEAKER_13]: and have it printed in 3D.

1583
01:45:55,822 --> 01:45:59,726
[SPEAKER_13]: That's right, your own Minecraft world creations in 3D.

1584
01:46:00,467 --> 01:46:08,875
[SPEAKER_13]: And you just have to download the app that's on the Fingerprints website, just fingerprints.com slash Minecraft.

1585
01:46:09,956 --> 01:46:32,350
[SPEAKER_13]: and you can go check it out and I guess the price is very depending on the size of your model that you're having printed and they kind of give some examples and they're pretty cool looking I had gotten one from my Xbox 360 avatar so I actually have an avatar you know 3D avatar of myself at my desk which is pretty awesome

1586
01:46:33,170 --> 01:46:38,954
[SPEAKER_13]: But, yeah, it doesn't really say how much it would cost for your creations.

1587
01:46:39,414 --> 01:46:45,058
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, there would be some cool stuff I'd want to make from our world, but I'd have to see how much this is.

1588
01:46:46,279 --> 01:46:48,060
[SPEAKER_13]: Looks like it may only be like one chunk.

1589
01:46:49,441 --> 01:46:53,443
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm thinking it might be one chunk, but neat.

1590
01:46:54,224 --> 01:46:54,684
[SPEAKER_13]: Kind of cool.

1591
01:46:54,844 --> 01:46:55,224
[SPEAKER_13]: Looks cool.

1592
01:46:55,504 --> 01:46:55,665
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1593
01:46:56,710 --> 01:47:12,557
[SPEAKER_16]: Moving on, classic Dragon Quest fans will rejoice in the news that the Heartbeat Studio that originally developed the games in the Super Nintendo and PS1 games that closed shortly thereafter is up for a revival as the Genius Sonority.

1594
01:47:13,357 --> 01:47:17,559
[SPEAKER_16]: They previously worked on Pokemon Colosseum, Dragon Quest Swords, and the Dinpamin.

1595
01:47:17,719 --> 01:47:19,060
[SPEAKER_16]: They came by wave.

1596
01:47:19,800 --> 01:47:28,210
[SPEAKER_16]: Manaba Yamana revealed by Twitter that Heartbeat will be relaunched after a decade, starting early next year with a new business perspective.

1597
01:47:28,811 --> 01:47:33,957
[SPEAKER_16]: According to Inside Games, Yamana said to expect a new webpage with more information next year.

1598
01:47:34,397 --> 01:47:37,100
[SPEAKER_16]: Can only imagine what their debut title is going to be.

1599
01:47:38,799 --> 01:47:41,660
[SPEAKER_16]: Origin has been hit by a series of security breaches.

1600
01:47:41,780 --> 01:47:46,663
[SPEAKER_16]: As users come to find out, their accounts have been cracked and personal details have been leaked.

1601
01:47:47,703 --> 01:47:48,263
[SPEAKER_16]: Sigh.

1602
01:47:48,503 --> 01:47:53,465
[SPEAKER_16]: To make matters worse, EA's own security measures ensure victims aren't resolving the issue.

1603
01:47:53,525 --> 01:48:01,189
[SPEAKER_16]: Because it's so unable to log back in, change your email address back, change your password, certain things along those lines.

1604
01:48:02,069 --> 01:48:13,353
[SPEAKER_16]: Users affected by the attack are told that their email address is invalid whenever they try to log in, and as soon as they call EA to find out what's wrong, they get shut down by representatives who can't help them without a receipt and valid date of birth.

1605
01:48:14,173 --> 01:48:15,954
[SPEAKER_13]: S. M. H.

1606
01:48:16,385 --> 01:48:19,787
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, with validated birth courses being changed by said hacker.

1607
01:48:20,827 --> 01:48:27,670
[SPEAKER_16]: Because, you know, that has to be something that will change because you will mysteriously be born at a different date than you once were.

1608
01:48:28,731 --> 01:48:30,151
[SPEAKER_16]: God bless web development.

1609
01:48:30,491 --> 01:48:35,314
[SPEAKER_16]: NeoGAF has managed to compile tens of thousands of threads.

1610
01:48:35,334 --> 01:48:36,214
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, that wouldn't surprise me.

1611
01:48:36,274 --> 01:48:44,458
[SPEAKER_16]: Ten threads of complaints on EA's official forums and just a sample of the overall total of grief being expunged on the internet.

1612
01:48:44,998 --> 01:48:46,941
[SPEAKER_16]: If you use Origin, do your due diligence.

1613
01:48:47,282 --> 01:48:52,669
[SPEAKER_16]: Unique password, make sure all your stuff is correct so you at least have a remote chance of getting back into your account.

1614
01:48:53,430 --> 01:48:54,171
[SPEAKER_16]: Be internet safe.

1615
01:48:54,792 --> 01:49:00,160
[SPEAKER_15]: Since you brought up NeoGAF, I don't visit that site an awful lot because it's a little too busy and I have too much ADD.

1616
01:49:01,781 --> 01:49:27,351
[SPEAKER_15]: but there was like the most winning thread I've ever seen on a web forum was on NeoGAF this week and it had to do with photoshopping your favorite or no a descriptive animated gif as the box art for a game like I'm describing this and I'm doing a terrible job but like there was this great like somebody photoshopped a box art for Tokyo Jungle and it was like these two kitties and a dog all wrestling and it was really funny like there was just all this kind of stuff

1617
01:49:27,871 --> 01:49:30,632
[SPEAKER_15]: Grand Theft Auto 5 with a cop taking some guy out.

1618
01:49:30,873 --> 01:49:34,995
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like all these great animated GIFs from around the internet on video game box art.

1619
01:49:35,175 --> 01:49:38,396
[SPEAKER_15]: That's absolutely nothing to do with what you just talked about, but I like GIFs.

1620
01:49:39,497 --> 01:49:40,097
[SPEAKER_15]: Who doesn't?

1621
01:49:41,598 --> 01:49:45,159
[SPEAKER_16]: And two days ago was officially Miyamoto's 60th birthday.

1622
01:49:45,960 --> 01:49:48,401
[SPEAKER_16]: Not too much need to be said for a man like him.

1623
01:49:48,621 --> 01:49:56,225
[SPEAKER_16]: Imagine how the state of games would be different had Shigeru Miyamoto and Nintendo and the entire uprising that has happened on the last...

1624
01:49:57,105 --> 01:49:59,486
[SPEAKER_16]: Three decades not actually occurred.

1625
01:50:00,926 --> 01:50:01,366
[SPEAKER_16]: Uprising?

1626
01:50:02,087 --> 01:50:02,747
[SPEAKER_16]: Bad choice of words.

1627
01:50:02,787 --> 01:50:03,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Upchucking?

1628
01:50:04,387 --> 01:50:08,408
[SPEAKER_16]: In some cases, like the value Wii games, I suppose.

1629
01:50:08,829 --> 01:50:10,109
[SPEAKER_07]: How about Uther News?

1630
01:50:10,849 --> 01:50:11,309
[SPEAKER_16]: Uther News?

1631
01:50:11,629 --> 01:50:17,031
[SPEAKER_07]: Tom Hardy is going to be playing the lead in Splinter Cell for the movie version.

1632
01:50:17,171 --> 01:50:17,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Sam Fisher.

1633
01:50:18,612 --> 01:50:18,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

1634
01:50:19,512 --> 01:50:25,934
[SPEAKER_07]: However, he's also slated to join Michael Fassbender in an Assassin's Creed film.

1635
01:50:26,294 --> 01:50:26,434
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

1636
01:50:28,355 --> 01:50:54,095
[SPEAKER_07]: also god as if this wasn't enough who remembers Barkley Shut Up and Jam well the group that did Barkley Shut Up and Jam Gaiden the sequel that was all completely parody have a new kickstarter up to make a game called Magical Realms of Tirnanog Escape from Necron 7 Revenge of Kokolin the official game of the movie chapter 2 of the Hoops Barkley saga that's awesome

1637
01:50:55,259 --> 01:50:57,580
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Jet Set Radio Vita will be out November 20th.

1638
01:50:58,161 --> 01:51:01,763
[SPEAKER_07]: And a mobile version will be out in nine days after for iOS and Android.

1639
01:51:02,043 --> 01:51:02,383
[SPEAKER_07]: The end.

1640
01:51:03,764 --> 01:51:05,865
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's get to the foogle question of the week.

1641
01:51:14,089 --> 01:51:17,771
[SPEAKER_15]: Take Facebook and Google Plus and slam... Yes, people are on Google Plus.

1642
01:51:18,031 --> 01:51:19,852
[SPEAKER_15]: And slam them together and you get foogle.

1643
01:51:19,872 --> 01:51:20,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Make him do it.

1644
01:51:20,713 --> 01:51:22,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Make him have retarded babies.

1645
01:51:23,835 --> 01:51:24,095
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

1646
01:51:26,465 --> 01:51:26,965
[SPEAKER_15]: Fugle.

1647
01:51:27,306 --> 01:51:28,266
[SPEAKER_15]: Go Fugle yourself.

1648
01:51:29,207 --> 01:51:29,527
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1649
01:51:31,549 --> 01:51:37,874
[SPEAKER_15]: Every week we ask a question on our Fugle communities and we get answers and we read some of our favorite answers on the show.

1650
01:51:39,575 --> 01:51:44,219
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a lot of responses this week because I actually planned ahead this week and asked the question a whole day early.

1651
01:51:44,319 --> 01:51:46,801
[SPEAKER_15]: So you're very welcome that we get more participation this week.

1652
01:51:47,481 --> 01:51:54,468
[SPEAKER_15]: Very controversial article going around the internet this week because, you know, how else do you get hits for your website?

1653
01:51:54,508 --> 01:52:00,354
[SPEAKER_15]: Stir up some controversy like determining the all-time 100 best video games.

1654
01:52:00,435 --> 01:52:06,201
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, usually, I wouldn't give two shits about a list like this because everybody's got one on their site, whatever.

1655
01:52:07,181 --> 01:52:08,222
[SPEAKER_15]: Timemagazine.com

1656
01:52:26,139 --> 01:52:32,387
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, I don't have time to read the entire list here, but just to give you an idea of some of the things they named.

1657
01:52:33,048 --> 01:52:34,710
[SPEAKER_15]: The Oregon Trail was on there.

1658
01:52:36,753 --> 01:52:38,475
[SPEAKER_15]: Mass Effect 3 was on there.

1659
01:52:41,814 --> 01:53:07,240
[SPEAKER_15]: when I looked at the list I saw it as a little more like these are influential games not necessarily the best games but games that were felt and there's only two games from this decade on the entire list from the 2010s Mass Effect 3 and Batman Arkham City which, well, Batman Arkham City was a pretty fucking great game too both pretty worthy both pretty worthy

1660
01:53:08,501 --> 01:53:14,469
[SPEAKER_15]: The oldest games on the list from the 1970s The Oregon Trail, Hunt the Wumpus Does anyone remember that?

1661
01:53:14,569 --> 01:53:22,679
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually remember the Wumpus game Pong, Breakout, Space Invaders, Adventure, and Asteroids

1662
01:53:23,120 --> 01:53:23,641
[SPEAKER_15]: No Guardian Legend

1663
01:53:41,337 --> 01:53:43,779
[SPEAKER_15]: They did Final Fantasy 7, and yes, no Guardian Legend.

1664
01:53:44,079 --> 01:53:44,780
[SPEAKER_15]: Bastards!

1665
01:53:45,280 --> 01:53:46,261
[SPEAKER_16]: They picked 7.

1666
01:53:46,301 --> 01:53:47,743
[SPEAKER_16]: That is amazing justification.

1667
01:53:47,983 --> 01:53:48,603
[SPEAKER_15]: I can see.

1668
01:53:48,683 --> 01:53:48,984
[SPEAKER_15]: I can see.

1669
01:53:49,004 --> 01:53:49,264
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1670
01:53:49,864 --> 01:53:55,509
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, look, we asked you guys on Google Plus and on Facebook, we're sure many of you saw this list.

1671
01:53:55,589 --> 01:54:02,936
[SPEAKER_15]: What was your impression of the list, being that Time is more of a news organization than something that typically caters to entertainment?

1672
01:54:03,296 --> 01:54:04,437
[SPEAKER_15]: Were they mostly right?

1673
01:54:04,637 --> 01:54:06,739
[SPEAKER_15]: Were there any glaring omissions or issues?

1674
01:54:07,499 --> 01:54:09,902
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's some of the answers from Google+.

1675
01:54:11,063 --> 01:54:16,149
[SPEAKER_15]: Kevin R replied and said, I think Wii Sports should not be on this list.

1676
01:54:16,870 --> 01:54:20,894
[SPEAKER_15]: What about cult followings like Disgaea and .hack and Persona?

1677
01:54:21,314 --> 01:54:23,557
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see some that are not for the mainstream.

1678
01:54:25,086 --> 01:54:29,448
[SPEAKER_15]: Kevin, I'm totally with you on the second half, but Wii Sports not being on the list.

1679
01:54:29,488 --> 01:54:30,829
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, here's the thing.

1680
01:54:32,530 --> 01:54:35,892
[SPEAKER_15]: The fact that it's Time Magazine is why Wii Sports is on the list.

1681
01:54:36,072 --> 01:54:38,393
[SPEAKER_15]: This was not EGM or some game.

1682
01:54:38,773 --> 01:54:44,036
[SPEAKER_15]: You have to remember, Wii Sports broke the mainstream in a way very few video games have.

1683
01:54:44,116 --> 01:54:46,317
[SPEAKER_15]: It is the top-selling video game ever.

1684
01:54:47,137 --> 01:54:47,858
[SPEAKER_15]: Am I not right?

1685
01:54:47,878 --> 01:54:49,219
[SPEAKER_15]: 100% agree.

1686
01:54:50,959 --> 01:55:00,902
[SPEAKER_16]: Very unfortunate for us and what we do, our feelings and what we say, but Wii Sports is the number one reason why, as you said before, the Wii was such a runaway sale, period.

1687
01:55:01,042 --> 01:55:01,902
[SPEAKER_15]: But I get it.

1688
01:55:01,922 --> 01:55:06,523
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not here to argue with listeners who are commenting on Google for the first time.

1689
01:55:06,804 --> 01:55:07,584
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not doing that.

1690
01:55:07,984 --> 01:55:13,645
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm just saying, think about it this way, because even though it's a gamer, you might be like, there really isn't much of a game here.

1691
01:55:13,685 --> 01:55:15,306
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just flailing about here, but...

1692
01:55:15,806 --> 01:55:17,027
[SPEAKER_07]: Only way bowling counts.

1693
01:55:17,347 --> 01:55:20,388
[SPEAKER_15]: That flailing got sold a hell of a lot of systems.

1694
01:55:22,269 --> 01:55:29,133
[SPEAKER_15]: Elliot B says, I disagree that Batman Arkham City and Mass Effect 3 are the best games of the 2010s.

1695
01:55:29,573 --> 01:55:32,415
[SPEAKER_15]: Portal 2 and Minecraft are far better.

1696
01:55:33,855 --> 01:55:35,876
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Portal 2 I'll give you.

1697
01:55:36,357 --> 01:55:37,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Minecraft, vomit.

1698
01:55:38,938 --> 01:55:40,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Until someone buys me a copy.

1699
01:55:41,319 --> 01:55:43,820
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry, but your opinion doesn't count on Minecraft.

1700
01:55:45,538 --> 01:55:47,720
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that sounds harsh, but I'm sorry.

1701
01:55:48,740 --> 01:55:49,781
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's the thing I do want to say.

1702
01:55:49,821 --> 01:55:51,823
[SPEAKER_15]: To be fair, Portal 1 is on the list.

1703
01:55:52,303 --> 01:55:54,585
[SPEAKER_15]: And so they did the whole no sequels thing.

1704
01:55:54,665 --> 01:55:58,107
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm okay with Portal 1 topping Portal 2.

1705
01:55:59,348 --> 01:56:03,992
[SPEAKER_15]: Minecraft, I think that's one of those let it age like a wine games.

1706
01:56:05,211 --> 01:56:11,075
[SPEAKER_15]: I think in five more years, I think we haven't really felt Minecraft's influence yet.

1707
01:56:11,755 --> 01:56:22,442
[SPEAKER_15]: Batman Arkham City and Mass Effect 3 were final games in long-running series, or the latest games in long-running series.

1708
01:56:22,522 --> 01:56:24,523
[SPEAKER_15]: They had a little different battle to that list.

1709
01:56:27,085 --> 01:56:27,385
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see.

1710
01:56:29,412 --> 01:56:31,034
[SPEAKER_15]: Robert G picked up on something.

1711
01:56:31,374 --> 01:56:33,676
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a good list, but it had some editing problems.

1712
01:56:33,916 --> 01:56:37,200
[SPEAKER_15]: Atari's adventure screenshot was not from the actual game.

1713
01:56:37,780 --> 01:56:43,105
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to see if that is... Is that not from the game?

1714
01:56:43,165 --> 01:56:43,946
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm trying to look at it.

1715
01:56:44,367 --> 01:56:45,448
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess maybe not.

1716
01:56:45,568 --> 01:56:50,232
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, it looks like a game screenshot, but I'm thinking like, when do you take the red dragon there?

1717
01:56:50,292 --> 01:56:51,894
[SPEAKER_15]: Weren't they all in front of little castles?

1718
01:56:52,314 --> 01:56:53,876
[SPEAKER_15]: Or could you move them around?

1719
01:56:55,370 --> 01:57:16,103
[SPEAKER_15]: I think someone like googled that and said let's use this one probably probably it could have been like you know it could have been like a hacked image or something like that maybe so I think they could have found a better one it's like when you go to the movie and like the scene you saw in the trailer isn't in the movie which happens all the time it happens all the time now that was a big thing in TV commercials for a while too

1720
01:57:17,931 --> 01:57:19,232
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, TV commercials for shows.

1721
01:57:19,272 --> 01:57:20,072
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, all the time.

1722
01:57:20,293 --> 01:57:20,673
[SPEAKER_15]: All the time.

1723
01:57:20,993 --> 01:57:23,455
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, that was some of the answers from Google+.

1724
01:57:23,475 --> 01:57:26,577
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry I didn't read them all, but there's some good stuff there, so I hope you will check them out.

1725
01:57:27,177 --> 01:57:28,838
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me read some of the answers from Facebook.

1726
01:57:28,958 --> 01:57:43,768
[SPEAKER_15]: Critical Myth, also on the VOG Network, replies, starting off, It was a nice walk through gaming nostalgia, but whenever it comes to lists like these, they can't possibly take our subjective likes and dislikes and personal histories into account to match our expectations or preferences.

1727
01:57:44,529 --> 01:57:45,649
[SPEAKER_15]: A very good reminder.

1728
01:57:47,773 --> 01:57:50,339
[SPEAKER_15]: But hey, we still have to argue about it anyway, right?

1729
01:57:51,331 --> 01:58:04,438
[SPEAKER_15]: Tiara, our good buddy Tiara from geek-life.com replies and says, Don't get me wrong, Final Fantasy Tactics is one of my favorite games, but how did that make it on the list, but Final Fantasy 4 and 6 didn't?

1730
01:58:04,998 --> 01:58:07,780
[SPEAKER_15]: Overall, a lot of good choices, but some questionable ones as well.

1731
01:58:08,260 --> 01:58:12,442
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Tiara, I'm pretty sure 4 and 6 didn't make the list because 7 did.

1732
01:58:12,663 --> 01:58:12,903
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1733
01:58:13,243 --> 01:58:19,486
[SPEAKER_15]: And now we're going to go back and have that old argument about Final Fantasy 7, so I'll just let that be.

1734
01:58:19,806 --> 01:58:20,827
[SPEAKER_16]: Interesting that they did jump.

1735
01:58:23,391 --> 01:58:30,742
[SPEAKER_16]: Not that the Final Fantasy universe was canonical from release to release, but interesting that they would jump out to Tactics in addition to 7.

1736
01:58:31,553 --> 01:58:31,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Breath of Fire

1737
01:58:54,944 --> 01:58:57,006
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a big list.

1738
01:58:57,046 --> 01:58:58,727
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I have a quesadilla in my mouth.

1739
01:58:58,967 --> 01:59:01,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, I'm just using it as an example.

1740
01:59:01,809 --> 01:59:06,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Did they do Tactics Ogre or anything that was that same style of gameplay?

1741
01:59:06,753 --> 01:59:20,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Because Final Fantasy Tactics really, I think, took out sort of something that was almost niche, like just slightly outside the niche level, and really brought it into mainstream because it was a big name that everyone recognized.

1742
01:59:20,562 --> 01:59:21,223
[SPEAKER_15]: I would agree with that.

1743
01:59:21,503 --> 01:59:24,784
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm scanning this list real quick trying to look for tactical games.

1744
01:59:25,104 --> 01:59:26,684
[SPEAKER_15]: Desktop Tower Defense.

1745
01:59:27,504 --> 01:59:28,725
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't even know what that game is.

1746
01:59:28,805 --> 01:59:31,545
[SPEAKER_15]: It sounds like it could be tactical.

1747
01:59:32,266 --> 01:59:33,086
[SPEAKER_16]: It's Tower Defense.

1748
01:59:33,106 --> 01:59:34,066
[SPEAKER_16]: That's about all you have to say.

1749
01:59:36,086 --> 01:59:39,927
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, but look at all the fucking Tower Defense games we have now.

1750
01:59:40,367 --> 01:59:41,388
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a huge part of iOS.

1751
01:59:42,128 --> 01:59:43,288
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I agree with it on the list.

1752
01:59:43,428 --> 01:59:46,089
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm saying the genre... How dare you disagree?

1753
01:59:49,192 --> 02:00:05,674
[SPEAKER_16]: not a lot of other tactical games on the list I don't see a lot of those other games you were mentioning I definitely agree with Jamie's point is that they took a beautiful world with a great story gave it a similar enough engine and it is one of the only strategy games to hit as wide adoption as it did

1754
02:00:07,118 --> 02:00:09,741
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see some of the other answers from Facebook.

1755
02:00:10,501 --> 02:00:13,224
[SPEAKER_15]: Daniel S replied and said, yeah, didn't bother with the list.

1756
02:00:13,604 --> 02:00:15,926
[SPEAKER_15]: They're just bait for more page clicks.

1757
02:00:16,406 --> 02:00:19,029
[SPEAKER_15]: Check out IGN's top 100 RPGs list.

1758
02:00:19,309 --> 02:00:20,690
[SPEAKER_15]: They put Persona 4 at number 90.

1759
02:00:21,251 --> 02:00:22,612
[SPEAKER_15]: I stopped reading lists after that.

1760
02:00:23,112 --> 02:00:29,533
[SPEAKER_15]: While I don't totally disagree with you, one reason I picked this list in particular is that it is Time Magazine.

1761
02:00:29,714 --> 02:00:31,594
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not a video game site.

1762
02:00:31,714 --> 02:00:32,654
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like a news site.

1763
02:00:32,754 --> 02:00:37,575
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, while yes, to some extent, it probably still is bait for page clicks.

1764
02:00:37,635 --> 02:00:38,676
[SPEAKER_15]: Most things on the internet are.

1765
02:00:39,316 --> 02:00:43,737
[SPEAKER_15]: I kind of felt there was still that history behind the publication.

1766
02:00:43,817 --> 02:00:46,337
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be different if this is something they were putting in their magazine.

1767
02:00:47,257 --> 02:00:49,558
[SPEAKER_07]: In actual print publication, but it's not.

1768
02:00:50,842 --> 02:00:54,564
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't... Has Time done an actual video game issue?

1769
02:00:55,405 --> 02:00:57,846
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think... Well, in the 80s probably.

1770
02:00:58,587 --> 02:01:04,610
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't think we've had anything modern coming out there where they actually go into the economics behind it, where they go into the social aspects behind it.

1771
02:01:04,630 --> 02:01:08,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's something I would put more along the line of Time Magazine's caliber.

1772
02:01:09,393 --> 02:01:13,936
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the type of editorial I'd want to see out of Time Magazine in relation to video games, not a top 100 list.

1773
02:01:15,681 --> 02:01:44,592
[SPEAKER_15]: Jonathan L with a good reply here on Facebook well they're all good but this one particularly caught my attention this seems it seems this is actually a list of games that were original for their time rather than a list of the all-time best the super NES library says hi the list also doesn't have any treasure games DS games arcade music games 3d sports games 3d fighting games MOBAs or any of the top 40 games on twitch TV right now therefore it is invalid World of Warcraft has to be in the top 40 of twitch TV

1774
02:01:45,352 --> 02:01:46,993
[SPEAKER_15]: with all the arena matches that go on on there.

1775
02:01:47,033 --> 02:01:49,313
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think you might have overlooked that one, but I get your point.

1776
02:01:49,433 --> 02:01:50,414
[SPEAKER_16]: I hadn't even considered it.

1777
02:01:50,494 --> 02:01:51,734
[SPEAKER_16]: DDR isn't a game on the list.

1778
02:01:51,854 --> 02:01:54,075
[SPEAKER_16]: No, DDR was not on the list, but Guitar Hero was.

1779
02:01:54,955 --> 02:01:55,135
[SPEAKER_16]: Huh.

1780
02:01:55,155 --> 02:01:56,415
[SPEAKER_16]: I wonder if there's any relationship there.

1781
02:01:56,495 --> 02:01:59,456
[SPEAKER_15]: Everyone knows that DDR ripped off Guitar Hero.

1782
02:02:00,796 --> 02:02:01,597
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's the thing.

1783
02:02:02,377 --> 02:02:08,058
[SPEAKER_15]: In America, I know this is hard for the longtime fans to hear, so just hold your breath for a minute.

1784
02:02:08,098 --> 02:02:08,559
[SPEAKER_15]: Not too long.

1785
02:02:08,599 --> 02:02:08,959
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't choke.

1786
02:02:10,039 --> 02:02:13,460
[SPEAKER_15]: Guitar Hero made a bigger impact in the States than DDR did.

1787
02:02:14,454 --> 02:02:14,854
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry.

1788
02:02:14,954 --> 02:02:15,354
[SPEAKER_16]: No?

1789
02:02:15,474 --> 02:02:15,794
[SPEAKER_16]: Gray?

1790
02:02:16,295 --> 02:02:16,875
[SPEAKER_16]: Truth hurts.

1791
02:02:17,175 --> 02:02:17,795
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, guys.

1792
02:02:17,855 --> 02:02:21,016
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I won't deny the splash that it made.

1793
02:02:21,036 --> 02:02:23,897
[SPEAKER_15]: Whether it should have or not is another argument.

1794
02:02:24,037 --> 02:02:25,177
[SPEAKER_16]: And I won't argue that.

1795
02:02:25,277 --> 02:02:28,658
[SPEAKER_16]: Guitar Hero 1 and 2 I had a hell of a lot of fun with.

1796
02:02:28,778 --> 02:02:37,461
[SPEAKER_16]: It was, you know, being the Bimani kid all throughout the 98 release up until... Oh, when did Guitar Hero come out?

1797
02:02:37,481 --> 02:02:39,062
[SPEAKER_16]: 07, I believe?

1798
02:02:39,082 --> 02:02:39,422
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1799
02:02:40,362 --> 02:02:41,662
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for watching!

1800
02:03:10,351 --> 02:03:14,375
[SPEAKER_16]: and Guitar Hero for less presentation, more performance.

1801
02:03:14,895 --> 02:03:28,006
[SPEAKER_15]: I will say, though, to give to the other side of the coin, though, because I am a longtime DDR fan, one thing that should be acknowledged about Dance Dance Revolution that the Guitar Hero can't lay claim to is that none of these video games will you find in a PE class.

1802
02:03:29,207 --> 02:03:31,870
[SPEAKER_15]: But DDR is the only game to have broken that barrier, so...

1803
02:03:33,511 --> 02:03:34,812
[SPEAKER_15]: D.D.R.

1804
02:03:34,872 --> 02:03:36,913
[SPEAKER_15]: and a P.E.

1805
02:03:36,953 --> 02:03:38,294
[SPEAKER_15]: class is kind of a new thing.

1806
02:03:38,694 --> 02:03:43,577
[SPEAKER_15]: Give it five or ten years and maybe we will have accepted it a little more as a culture.

1807
02:03:43,757 --> 02:03:46,418
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe Minecraft will soon become sculpting class lessons.

1808
02:03:46,438 --> 02:03:46,819
[SPEAKER_15]: Who knows?

1809
02:03:46,999 --> 02:03:47,279
[SPEAKER_15]: Who knows?

1810
02:03:47,559 --> 02:03:49,480
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, let me read like one more of these.

1811
02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:53,343
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm so sorry I didn't get to everybody, but I want to read this one from Degenerate Johnny.

1812
02:03:54,363 --> 02:03:58,886
[SPEAKER_15]: It appears to me that most of the mainstream media focuses on commercial successes or games with a cult following.

1813
02:03:59,306 --> 02:04:03,569
[SPEAKER_15]: Since this is a top 100 list, it doesn't surprise me that Time did the same thing in this scenario.

1814
02:04:03,989 --> 02:04:10,114
[SPEAKER_15]: The purpose of this list was not to inform us gamers, because this is something that we can expect from a generalized top 100 list.

1815
02:04:10,534 --> 02:04:15,758
[SPEAKER_15]: This list was to inform the magazine's target market, which is clearly not us gamers.

1816
02:04:16,138 --> 02:04:20,804
[SPEAKER_15]: Movie buffs don't care about top 100 movie lists from magazines such as Time and People.

1817
02:04:21,104 --> 02:04:21,725
[SPEAKER_15]: Why should we?

1818
02:04:22,125 --> 02:04:24,348
[SPEAKER_15]: Playboy features games in almost every issue.

1819
02:04:24,688 --> 02:04:25,830
[SPEAKER_15]: Should we care about this?

1820
02:04:26,290 --> 02:04:31,176
[SPEAKER_15]: Only if there's a centerfold of our favorite video game female characters, or male if you read Playgirl.

1821
02:04:31,596 --> 02:04:33,659
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie, quit drooling over the centerfold of Garrus.

1822
02:04:34,341 --> 02:04:34,661
[SPEAKER_16]: Really?

1823
02:04:35,842 --> 02:04:37,624
[SPEAKER_16]: Gaming in every issue of Playboy?

1824
02:04:37,804 --> 02:04:38,164
[SPEAKER_16]: Honestly?

1825
02:04:38,584 --> 02:04:39,445
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm pretty sure they do.

1826
02:04:39,585 --> 02:04:40,766
[SPEAKER_15]: It is a magazine for men.

1827
02:04:40,946 --> 02:04:41,287
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

1828
02:04:42,828 --> 02:04:43,188
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

1829
02:04:44,009 --> 02:04:45,049
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just funny to think about.

1830
02:04:45,069 --> 02:04:46,330
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not enough Turian in my life.

1831
02:04:47,331 --> 02:04:53,936
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, before the weird turn that comment took in the second half, I'm so with you on the first half.

1832
02:04:54,036 --> 02:04:54,317
[SPEAKER_15]: It was...

1833
02:04:56,378 --> 02:05:00,343
[SPEAKER_15]: The mainstream media focuses on commercial successes or games of the cult following.

1834
02:05:00,383 --> 02:05:02,205
[SPEAKER_15]: That is where this list really came from.

1835
02:05:02,225 --> 02:05:04,768
[SPEAKER_07]: For the record, I have to say one thing real quick.

1836
02:05:05,208 --> 02:05:06,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know what Cleverbot is?

1837
02:05:07,631 --> 02:05:08,192
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that an AOL bot?

1838
02:05:09,136 --> 02:05:09,536
[SPEAKER_07]: Kind of.

1839
02:05:09,596 --> 02:05:10,337
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually a website.

1840
02:05:10,357 --> 02:05:11,638
[SPEAKER_07]: You type stuff in and it replies to you.

1841
02:05:12,318 --> 02:05:15,360
[SPEAKER_07]: I typed in Turians and it replied, I am the very model of a scientist, Larian.

1842
02:05:17,882 --> 02:05:18,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Just saying.

1843
02:05:18,302 --> 02:05:20,263
[SPEAKER_15]: Because some nerd works at that website.

1844
02:05:20,303 --> 02:05:20,803
[SPEAKER_15]: You know it.

1845
02:05:21,024 --> 02:05:22,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there's portal ones on here too.

1846
02:05:22,384 --> 02:05:22,625
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah!

1856
02:06:07,255 --> 02:06:09,677
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, I think you should go work for Nintendo.

1857
02:06:10,037 --> 02:06:11,398
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, because I know what the internet is?

1858
02:06:11,938 --> 02:06:15,060
[SPEAKER_13]: Instead of like, what is this internet you speak of?

1859
02:06:15,500 --> 02:06:16,341
[SPEAKER_16]: You'd be surprised.

1860
02:06:16,541 --> 02:06:16,961
[SPEAKER_13]: Why not?

1861
02:06:18,822 --> 02:06:21,384
[SPEAKER_13]: We have to make screen name.

1862
02:06:21,424 --> 02:06:26,707
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll attach it to the console and if their console breaks... Our consoles never break!

1863
02:06:26,887 --> 02:06:27,007
[SPEAKER_13]: You...

1864
02:06:28,268 --> 02:06:28,908
[SPEAKER_13]: Death to you!

1865
02:06:28,968 --> 02:06:29,349
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

1866
02:06:31,050 --> 02:06:31,690
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright, Loki.

1867
02:06:32,410 --> 02:06:33,191
[SPEAKER_13]: How about some real news?

1868
02:06:33,971 --> 02:06:34,792
[SPEAKER_13]: Some real news?

1869
02:06:34,992 --> 02:06:35,292
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1870
02:06:35,872 --> 02:06:37,453
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's talk about Black Ops 2.

1871
02:06:37,513 --> 02:06:39,394
[SPEAKER_13]: Black Ops 2, big surprise.

1872
02:06:39,475 --> 02:06:41,536
[SPEAKER_13]: Biggest title of the year.

1873
02:06:42,176 --> 02:06:43,677
[SPEAKER_13]: It has broken all sorts of records.

1874
02:06:44,257 --> 02:06:50,641
[SPEAKER_13]: Modern Warfare 3, of course, sold 6.5 million copies in the US and UK.

1875
02:06:50,661 --> 02:06:55,704
[SPEAKER_13]: The previous record was $400 million in the first day.

1876
02:06:56,084 --> 02:06:57,365
[SPEAKER_13]: Black Ops 2 beat that

1877
02:06:57,845 --> 02:07:01,048
[SPEAKER_13]: with $500 million in the first day.

1878
02:07:01,189 --> 02:07:08,116
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's a lot of game and the biggest entertainment launch in history.

1879
02:07:09,901 --> 02:07:34,726
[SPEAKER_15]: so hooray and I'm sure next year you'll maybe beat your record again Modern Warfare 4 will break it Black Ops 3 will break it well if there's new consoles next year though that could throw an interesting monkey wrench in the situation nah because they'll make it for the other consoles as well that's true there'll be that little while where they're making it for everything cause there's a Wii U version no Wii version are they still making Playstation 2 versions nope

1880
02:07:36,545 --> 02:07:37,766
[SPEAKER_16]: That stopped with World of War.

1881
02:07:38,186 --> 02:07:45,248
[SPEAKER_16]: Not as of the big titles, but I was actually glancing over when you guys were doing release dates, and I do still see some new title PlayStation 2 versions.

1882
02:07:45,268 --> 02:07:46,009
[SPEAKER_13]: Pro Evo.

1883
02:07:47,109 --> 02:07:51,871
[SPEAKER_13]: Which is Pro Evo, just like the Wii version, and FIFA was just like the same thing.

1884
02:07:52,211 --> 02:07:53,452
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are just rehashed versions.

1885
02:07:53,632 --> 02:07:54,992
[SPEAKER_13]: They're there, just saying.

1886
02:07:55,012 --> 02:07:57,133
[SPEAKER_13]: New PlayStation 2 titles, crazy to me.

1887
02:07:57,253 --> 02:08:04,018
[SPEAKER_15]: To be fair though, didn't we discuss on a prior show that really the only PlayStation 2 game that's left to come out is the Final Fantasy XI expansion?

1888
02:08:04,058 --> 02:08:05,579
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to say that came up in a prior show.

1889
02:08:05,959 --> 02:08:07,961
[SPEAKER_15]: That like, here's what you have to look forward to in 2013.

1890
02:08:09,522 --> 02:08:10,443
[SPEAKER_15]: One PlayStation 2 game.

1891
02:08:11,243 --> 02:08:12,104
[SPEAKER_15]: XI expansion?

1892
02:08:12,404 --> 02:08:12,704
[SPEAKER_15]: Mm-hmm.

1893
02:08:13,245 --> 02:08:14,165
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, duh.

1894
02:08:14,225 --> 02:08:14,526
[SPEAKER_13]: Never mind.

1895
02:08:14,766 --> 02:08:14,886
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1896
02:08:15,791 --> 02:08:16,151
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

1897
02:08:17,112 --> 02:08:18,853
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, lots of money.

1898
02:08:20,014 --> 02:08:20,354
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1899
02:08:20,734 --> 02:08:23,456
[SPEAKER_15]: Moving on to LEGO Lord of the Rings.

1900
02:08:23,556 --> 02:08:25,237
[SPEAKER_15]: I know some of y'all are excited about The Hobbit.

1901
02:08:26,058 --> 02:08:29,100
[SPEAKER_15]: And so, of course, up comes all the new tie-in games with this.

1902
02:08:29,480 --> 02:08:35,004
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's LEGO Lord of the Rings, which I guess, granted, LEGO is kind of its own little monster gaming series.

1903
02:08:35,164 --> 02:08:40,567
[SPEAKER_15]: But regardless, the Xbox 360 version of this came out just this past week.

1904
02:08:40,908 --> 02:08:42,268
[SPEAKER_15]: But here's something crazy.

1905
02:08:43,402 --> 02:08:50,524
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess some demo discs, as opposed to retail game discs, got shipped out to retailers.

1906
02:08:50,804 --> 02:08:51,124
[SPEAKER_13]: Not quite.

1907
02:08:51,805 --> 02:08:52,225
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, really?

1908
02:08:52,885 --> 02:08:59,147
[SPEAKER_13]: The retail discs actually got shipped out, but they were labeled as demo discs.

1909
02:08:59,187 --> 02:09:02,608
[SPEAKER_13]: They weren't actually demo discs, it's just a demo copy on it.

1910
02:09:02,768 --> 02:09:08,353
[SPEAKER_15]: But what a collector's item that is, because these stories are saying, quick, you better take them back and get them exchanged.

1911
02:09:08,753 --> 02:09:09,774
[SPEAKER_15]: Hell no, you shouldn't.

1912
02:09:09,834 --> 02:09:10,855
[SPEAKER_15]: Hang on to that thing.

1913
02:09:10,895 --> 02:09:14,298
[SPEAKER_15]: That's going to be money to some collector.

1914
02:09:14,559 --> 02:09:16,240
[SPEAKER_13]: It's only a small, it's not all of them.

1915
02:09:16,380 --> 02:09:19,263
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, in fact, all the ones we got shipped were not like that.

1916
02:09:19,803 --> 02:09:24,207
[SPEAKER_15]: Microsoft to Walmart, Target, and Toys R Us is the places you're going to find this.

1917
02:09:24,347 --> 02:09:26,349
[SPEAKER_15]: So not mom pod distribution.

1918
02:09:26,389 --> 02:09:26,850
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, Loki.

1919
02:09:28,603 --> 02:09:29,703
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, I got my little big planet.

1920
02:09:31,404 --> 02:09:33,725
[SPEAKER_15]: So, yeah, very interesting.

1921
02:09:33,785 --> 02:09:35,966
[SPEAKER_15]: So they are doing an official recall.

1922
02:09:36,266 --> 02:09:39,747
[SPEAKER_15]: You can contact WB Games either by email or by phone.

1923
02:09:39,807 --> 02:09:45,549
[SPEAKER_15]: But at the same time, if the disc really is the game, then hooray, you have the game.

1924
02:09:46,149 --> 02:09:51,191
[SPEAKER_15]: I say enjoy it and then keep that thing in good condition because a collector may want that someday.

1925
02:09:51,451 --> 02:09:51,671
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe.

1926
02:09:52,931 --> 02:09:53,231
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

1927
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:17,063
[SPEAKER_15]: or the competition cartridges from Nintendo World Championships.

1928
02:10:17,804 --> 02:10:20,185
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, I thought you were going to say the Blockbuster Championship thing.

1929
02:10:20,205 --> 02:10:20,725
[SPEAKER_15]: Those too.

1930
02:10:20,865 --> 02:10:23,206
[SPEAKER_15]: All those cartridges go for Buku Bucks too.

1931
02:10:23,727 --> 02:10:24,967
[SPEAKER_15]: Miss Prince and shit.

1932
02:10:25,328 --> 02:10:26,968
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, you collect old stuff.

1933
02:10:27,008 --> 02:10:28,129
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a Monopoly.

1934
02:10:29,570 --> 02:10:32,011
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, that's right, a Monopoly.

1935
02:10:32,471 --> 02:10:33,992
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was on Genesis?

1936
02:10:34,332 --> 02:10:35,273
[SPEAKER_07]: No, Master System.

1937
02:10:35,833 --> 02:10:36,754
[SPEAKER_07]: I have two of them.

1938
02:10:37,994 --> 02:10:39,135
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have an actual Monopoly.

1939
02:10:41,283 --> 02:10:51,006
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, let's move on with some more, no, not more news Yes, more news, I'm kidding I'm not with it tonight, DarkSakura

1940
02:10:52,577 --> 02:10:58,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, in other news, and I'm going to mispronounce the name of this game because I'm not sure exactly how it's said.

1941
02:10:58,539 --> 02:11:00,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it Arm A?

1942
02:11:00,499 --> 02:11:00,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Arm A3?

1943
02:11:01,039 --> 02:11:01,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Arma?

1944
02:11:01,540 --> 02:11:01,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Arma 3?

1945
02:11:01,780 --> 02:11:01,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1946
02:11:02,140 --> 02:11:06,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's not a game I'm super interested in, but I'm pretty pissed off about the situation.

1947
02:11:07,281 --> 02:11:20,505
[SPEAKER_07]: The developers, Ivan, I guess it's Busta, and Martin Peslar, have actually been held in jail for 70 days in Greece because they have been charged with espionage.

1948
02:11:21,245 --> 02:11:21,986
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1949
02:11:45,247 --> 02:11:52,992
[SPEAKER_07]: The shooter itself was based on the island where they were arrested and they said that they were just there on holiday.

1950
02:11:54,192 --> 02:11:57,674
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just a quote from Ivan's father.

1951
02:11:58,034 --> 02:11:59,695
[SPEAKER_07]: They're in a cell with over 25 people.

1952
02:11:59,755 --> 02:12:00,616
[SPEAKER_07]: They sleep on the ground.

1953
02:12:00,636 --> 02:12:01,777
[SPEAKER_07]: They have food twice a day.

1954
02:12:02,837 --> 02:12:06,359
[SPEAKER_07]: They no longer tell us on the phone that it's alright, that they're handling it.

1955
02:12:06,959 --> 02:12:11,402
[SPEAKER_07]: After the court's decision, we only hear from them something no parent ever wants to hear.

1956
02:12:11,482 --> 02:12:12,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Mom, Dad, please save us.

1957
02:12:13,623 --> 02:12:22,288
[SPEAKER_07]: So, the people have been writing to the Czech president and prime minister saying that the foreign ministry hasn't been doing enough.

1958
02:12:22,948 --> 02:12:27,831
[SPEAKER_07]: And the foreign ministry spokesperson says they're trying to work it from all angles and trying to help them out.

1959
02:12:28,851 --> 02:12:31,193
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah.

1960
02:12:34,334 --> 02:12:36,115
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's an ongoing saga.

1961
02:12:36,315 --> 02:12:39,777
[SPEAKER_15]: We heard about that before and they may be in there a little while, huh?

1962
02:12:40,278 --> 02:12:40,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's hope not.

1963
02:12:42,079 --> 02:12:43,661
[SPEAKER_15]: Skypline at 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Launch Radio on Skype

1964
02:12:57,796 --> 02:13:12,642
[SPEAKER_13]: But OpenFaint, the kind of alternative to using Game Room, at least on the iOS platform, and, well, it was one of the only kind of multi-platform kind of hubs for even the Android marketplace.

1965
02:13:12,682 --> 02:13:19,465
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you may remember Gris purchased OpenFaint, its parent company, back in April 2011.

1966
02:13:19,525 --> 02:13:19,765
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, now...

1967
02:13:21,946 --> 02:13:24,267
[SPEAKER_13]: OpenFaint is going to be shut down.

1968
02:13:24,708 --> 02:13:29,150
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're shutting down the service starting, well, actually effective December 14th.

1969
02:13:29,591 --> 02:13:35,534
[SPEAKER_13]: And in its place is going to be Grease platform that they have, which I've not experienced yet.

1970
02:13:36,234 --> 02:13:39,396
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what's funny is this is what I was teasing about before the break.

1971
02:13:39,836 --> 02:13:42,438
[SPEAKER_15]: One of our listeners, Picaruno, he always does these little live blogs.

1972
02:13:42,498 --> 02:13:43,458
[SPEAKER_15]: He's listening to the show.

1973
02:13:43,819 --> 02:13:45,380
[SPEAKER_15]: And he was listening to the podcast today.

1974
02:13:46,100 --> 02:13:51,103
[SPEAKER_15]: And he said about the show, Ha ha, you just mentioned OpenFaint not going out of business.

1975
02:13:51,503 --> 02:13:52,624
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1976
02:14:20,184 --> 02:14:26,226
[SPEAKER_16]: Early days of these networks really coming out, Aurora Faint turned into Open Faint and it was just a runaway hit.

1977
02:14:26,946 --> 02:14:28,327
[SPEAKER_16]: Wasn't Aurora Faint the game?

1978
02:14:28,347 --> 02:14:30,247
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1979
02:14:30,327 --> 02:14:38,390
[SPEAKER_16]: Aurora Faint had its little social hub network within game and whenever they started... That was a huge game in the early days of iOS.

1980
02:14:38,430 --> 02:14:44,733
[SPEAKER_16]: And whenever they opened their network, their platform to other people is how it became Open Faint that others could use.

1981
02:14:44,833 --> 02:14:45,693
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, Open Faint...

1982
02:14:46,113 --> 02:14:48,715
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1983
02:15:12,062 --> 02:15:13,144
[SPEAKER_15]: Copyright Work Tattoos

1984
02:15:27,463 --> 02:15:33,546
[SPEAKER_15]: So a tattoo artist has sued THQ, and if there's one company that can't afford a lawsuit right now, it's THQ.

1985
02:15:34,006 --> 02:15:42,410
[SPEAKER_15]: But a tattoo artist sued THQ over some tattoo art that is seen in UFC Undisputed 2010 and UFC Undisputed 3.

1986
02:15:42,510 --> 02:15:56,057
[SPEAKER_15]: The tattoo artist is named Chris Escobedo, and he filed a lawsuit against THQ because of a tattoo that he has copyrighted that is on MMA fighter Carlos Condit.

1987
02:15:56,637 --> 02:15:57,938
[SPEAKER_15]: in these UFC games.

1988
02:15:58,479 --> 02:16:07,686
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, his argument says that even though his tattoo is on this public figure, the tattoo's design still belongs to him.

1989
02:16:08,106 --> 02:16:09,427
[SPEAKER_15]: He created it originally.

1990
02:16:09,748 --> 02:16:12,790
[SPEAKER_15]: He never signed the rights to the design away to Condon.

1991
02:16:13,130 --> 02:16:24,419
[SPEAKER_15]: So by digitally recreating the design, which THQ did, THQ is said to have, in this lawsuit, violated Escobedo's copyright on the work.

1992
02:16:25,180 --> 02:16:25,380
[SPEAKER_15]: Jesus.

1993
02:16:25,400 --> 02:16:25,520
[SPEAKER_15]: Jesus.

1994
02:16:53,544 --> 02:16:58,889
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got a legal point, but honestly, this is just being selfish and greedy.

1995
02:16:59,750 --> 02:17:01,472
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, maybe he's got bills that need to be paid.

1996
02:17:01,512 --> 02:17:03,334
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1997
02:17:03,894 --> 02:17:09,740
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, if I did a design, you know, that's... Now, if it's something that...

1998
02:17:11,653 --> 02:17:31,506
[SPEAKER_07]: wasn't being worn on a human body like if it was like say a banner or something or some like actual artwork that I put up you know as something on display and they use that like as a logo or something you specifically with the intention of making money off of it

1999
02:17:32,125 --> 02:17:38,190
[SPEAKER_07]: All they did was recreate a likeness and the guy licensed his likeness, which includes everything attached to his likeness.

2000
02:17:51,721 --> 02:17:53,562
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2001
02:18:19,640 --> 02:18:24,625
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's not a copyright filed on it, this guy has no ground to stand on.

2002
02:18:26,407 --> 02:18:30,271
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, I think it's this guy's private business.

2003
02:18:30,751 --> 02:18:37,678
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that any tattoo artist, unless they're an independent contractor, license over their work to the studio they do the work for.

2004
02:18:38,255 --> 02:18:43,902
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, I want to get to your thoughts too as well as Jason if he has any but I'm going to the chat room because this is the exact same thing I thought of.

2005
02:18:44,303 --> 02:18:50,430
[SPEAKER_15]: Duke Newcomb at live.vognetwork.com says, didn't the same kind of thing happen with the Tyson tattoo in the Hangover Part 2?

2006
02:18:50,490 --> 02:18:51,792
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe it did.

2007
02:18:51,852 --> 02:18:56,438
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the exact same thing I thought of is that they had to go like digitally redo that guy.

2008
02:18:56,938 --> 02:18:57,579
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, your thoughts?

2009
02:18:57,659 --> 02:19:02,120
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I was just going to say, I don't think it's anything that... Can you even do that?

2010
02:19:02,160 --> 02:19:12,184
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, because if you think about it, you have this copyright thing, so he can't make any public appearances anywhere because if he's captured on camera, oh, it's a copyright violation.

2011
02:19:12,224 --> 02:19:15,385
[SPEAKER_13]: That seems a little stupid, like if you're putting it on somebody.

2012
02:19:15,485 --> 02:19:24,507
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, if it was something blatant, like he had him tattoo Nintendo's logo on his face or something like that, then that's a little kind of... What about that guy who got the Romney tattoo?

2013
02:19:24,527 --> 02:19:25,988
[SPEAKER_15]: It was all over the internet this week.

2014
02:19:26,408 --> 02:19:28,810
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually checking with one of my favorite sites ever, Freakonomics.

2015
02:19:29,470 --> 02:19:30,591
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Freakonomics.

2016
02:19:33,072 --> 02:19:40,497
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're going over that case you're talking about, The Hangover Part 2, about the art appearing without the artist's consent.

2017
02:19:43,259 --> 02:19:43,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2018
02:19:44,980 --> 02:19:46,741
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to read this paragraph here.

2019
02:19:47,341 --> 02:19:47,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

2020
02:20:08,989 --> 02:20:32,790
[SPEAKER_07]: and then so they're basically using it as that now they're asking does Warner Brothers have a way out the studio may claim that the tattoo is not original that it was inspired by Maori tattoos this is unlikely to work copyrights originality threshold is very low even if Whitmill adapted his design from one in the public domain it will nonetheless be copyrightable if not copied exactly if it is not copied exactly

2021
02:20:33,922 --> 02:20:35,806
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, before we move on to the mailbag, anything?

2022
02:20:36,427 --> 02:20:36,848
[SPEAKER_07]: One last thing.

2023
02:20:37,630 --> 02:20:41,618
[SPEAKER_07]: They say that it is also, though, quite likely protected under the Fair Use Doctrine.

2024
02:20:43,794 --> 02:20:45,655
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, interesting.

2025
02:20:45,875 --> 02:20:48,016
[SPEAKER_16]: I voted for Freakonomics on Podcast Awards.

2026
02:20:49,757 --> 02:20:50,897
[SPEAKER_16]: Best one in their category that I saw.

2027
02:20:51,037 --> 02:20:54,218
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually had the Freakonomics desk calendar.

2028
02:20:54,358 --> 02:20:56,900
[SPEAKER_07]: I used it for three years.

2029
02:20:56,960 --> 02:20:57,780
[SPEAKER_07]: I would get it every year.

2030
02:20:58,560 --> 02:21:00,281
[SPEAKER_07]: You learn a lot from this website.

2031
02:21:00,821 --> 02:21:01,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, just saying.

2032
02:21:01,861 --> 02:21:03,602
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, that came from Freakonomics.com.

2033
02:21:04,423 --> 02:21:05,523
[SPEAKER_07]: Copyright, blah, blah.

2034
02:21:08,179 --> 02:21:09,400
[SPEAKER_16]: I was going to ask the same question.

2035
02:21:09,440 --> 02:21:18,528
[SPEAKER_16]: Why isn't this an issue on especially pay-per-view, mixed martial arts, pay-per-view UFC broadcasts?

2036
02:21:18,648 --> 02:21:22,991
[SPEAKER_16]: Licensing, God only knows what happens behind the scenes, but I'm surprised that this hasn't come up before.

2037
02:21:24,513 --> 02:21:25,453
[SPEAKER_16]: Scary situation.

2038
02:21:25,493 --> 02:21:25,674
[SPEAKER_16]: The

2039
02:21:26,694 --> 02:21:37,002
[SPEAKER_16]: Before having known those details, I was going to say flat out that this is Carlos Condit's problems and he's on the hook for this problem for any license agreement broken or otherwise.

2040
02:21:37,442 --> 02:21:39,564
[SPEAKER_15]: I kind of agree with you.

2041
02:21:39,824 --> 02:21:44,888
[SPEAKER_15]: Before you get a piece of art permanently put on your body, you better think about who owns that art.

2042
02:21:45,008 --> 02:21:50,252
[SPEAKER_16]: At the same time, you want to say original or not, it's a tattoo and it's there.

2043
02:21:50,612 --> 02:21:52,993
[SPEAKER_15]: Unless you're getting it on your butt where no one will ever see it.

2044
02:21:53,633 --> 02:21:54,593
[SPEAKER_16]: But special people.

2045
02:21:54,794 --> 02:21:57,294
[SPEAKER_16]: Clearly not the case in this situation, but of course.

2046
02:21:57,875 --> 02:22:01,536
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that's a really crappy situation.

2047
02:22:02,476 --> 02:22:05,377
[SPEAKER_16]: Not having the expertise, I don't really want to comment anymore, but that's a scary thought.

2048
02:22:05,417 --> 02:22:07,018
[SPEAKER_07]: I do still think it's a case of money grabbing.

2049
02:22:07,418 --> 02:22:12,921
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm gonna get the copyright Mike Tyson tattoo on my butt and no one will ever know and I'll get away with a crime.

2050
02:22:14,282 --> 02:22:20,926
[SPEAKER_16]: You know what's gonna happen is that THQ, somebody is gonna shell out damages and there's gonna be a patch that's gonna be devoted to removing this in-game.

2051
02:22:21,106 --> 02:22:21,466
[SPEAKER_16]: Period.

2052
02:22:22,006 --> 02:22:22,707
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the era we live in.

2053
02:22:22,727 --> 02:22:27,109
[SPEAKER_07]: Either that or it's gonna be a patch that adds in a special copyright notice.

2054
02:22:27,489 --> 02:22:31,352
[SPEAKER_15]: Or licensed from... A 1K patch with text alterations.

2055
02:22:31,372 --> 02:22:35,554
[SPEAKER_15]: This is all time that THQ could spend working on something to make them money.

2056
02:22:36,644 --> 02:22:43,768
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura has asked me to dive into the mailbag tonight And I said, sure, why not I'll get my hands dirty

2057
02:22:54,833 --> 02:22:58,738
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2058
02:23:10,393 --> 02:23:10,913
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura.com

2059
02:23:34,230 --> 02:23:39,415
[SPEAKER_15]: Neither do I experience this issue with any other DVDs or CDs I've put into the DVD drive recently.

2060
02:23:39,915 --> 02:23:43,158
[SPEAKER_15]: Only Assassin's Creed 3 on Xbox 360 has given me this problem.

2061
02:23:43,578 --> 02:23:45,960
[SPEAKER_15]: My 360 is unmodded, so that's not the problem.

2062
02:23:46,501 --> 02:23:51,846
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, the Assassin's Creed 3 game disc does not appear to be broken, scratched, warped, chipped, or otherwise damaged.

2063
02:23:52,466 --> 02:23:56,247
[SPEAKER_15]: I've tried searching around online and can't find anyone else experiencing this problem.

2064
02:23:56,727 --> 02:23:59,448
[SPEAKER_15]: Or at least no one online is bitching about this problem.

2065
02:23:59,869 --> 02:24:04,830
[SPEAKER_15]: Am I an anomaly or is anyone else experiencing this problem with Assassin's Creed 3 under 360?

2066
02:24:05,671 --> 02:24:06,931
[SPEAKER_15]: Stay black, Redertainment.

2067
02:24:08,240 --> 02:24:09,001
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2068
02:24:28,939 --> 02:24:30,000
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2069
02:24:49,355 --> 02:24:54,681
[SPEAKER_15]: If you have the ability to do so, I would just install the game to your drive to be safe.

2070
02:24:55,021 --> 02:24:59,986
[SPEAKER_15]: Granted, you still need the game to boot the file, but I think you'll have a little more luck there.

2071
02:25:00,927 --> 02:25:03,891
[SPEAKER_15]: Otherwise, I would clean the disc anyway.

2072
02:25:04,992 --> 02:25:08,355
[SPEAKER_15]: You might not be able to see it, and clearly you've already established it's not your 360.

2073
02:25:08,395 --> 02:25:08,676
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the disc.

2074
02:25:12,388 --> 02:25:14,471
[SPEAKER_15]: and I don't own Assassin's Creed 3 so it was another game.

2075
02:25:14,491 --> 02:25:17,274
[SPEAKER_13]: Try the disc in another person's system to see if it's actually the disc.

2076
02:25:17,374 --> 02:25:21,679
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually want to say it was Mass Effect 2 because I bought that used and I think I had that problem.

2077
02:25:21,699 --> 02:25:23,381
[SPEAKER_13]: Mass Effect 2 is fucking up all the games.

2078
02:25:23,441 --> 02:25:24,062
[SPEAKER_13]: Seriously.

2079
02:25:25,844 --> 02:25:30,889
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pissed off at my Mass Effect 2 because I have the version that it does with a launcher and now I can't use text mod at the end.

2080
02:25:31,070 --> 02:25:31,310
[SPEAKER_15]: Dope.

2081
02:25:32,423 --> 02:25:36,806
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, let's go to an email from Ramaditya from Indonesia.

2082
02:25:37,627 --> 02:25:39,588
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi guys, it's Ramaditya from Indonesia.

2083
02:25:40,148 --> 02:25:42,230
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if you've already known about this.

2084
02:25:42,430 --> 02:25:46,532
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe you're familiar with an NES game called Blaster Master from Sunsoft.

2085
02:25:46,753 --> 02:25:47,093
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yes.

2086
02:25:47,753 --> 02:25:48,814
[SPEAKER_15]: One of my all-time favorites.

2087
02:25:50,415 --> 02:25:50,835
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

2088
02:25:50,875 --> 02:25:54,077
[SPEAKER_15]: In fact, now that you brought it up, see, now I have to.

2089
02:25:54,758 --> 02:25:55,538
[SPEAKER_15]: Now I have to.

2090
02:25:56,659 --> 02:26:00,262
[SPEAKER_15]: You brought it up, so now I have to dig through the folder.

2091
02:26:00,302 --> 02:26:01,943
[SPEAKER_07]: That means the song will be stuck in my head.

2092
02:26:03,153 --> 02:26:03,538
[SPEAKER_15]: Here you go.

2093
02:26:10,464 --> 02:26:10,984
[SPEAKER_15]: Much better.

2094
02:26:11,745 --> 02:26:14,086
[SPEAKER_15]: In fact, it was one of my favorite games when I was a child.

2095
02:26:14,587 --> 02:26:19,530
[SPEAKER_15]: Several days ago, I found out the info about the hack version of Blaster Master.

2096
02:26:20,010 --> 02:26:23,613
[SPEAKER_15]: The patch allows you to play eight completely different levels from the game.

2097
02:26:24,093 --> 02:26:31,378
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I cannot see, so it's impossible to tell you how good or bad it is, but my girlfriend, the one that tried the game, informed me it was great.

2098
02:26:31,858 --> 02:26:40,024
[SPEAKER_15]: To know more about it, please visit the link below, and he has a link to Zofar.net, which I... My first reaction was, that site's still around?

2099
02:26:41,045 --> 02:26:44,088
[SPEAKER_15]: I remember hanging out in IRC chat rooms that Zophar was in.

2100
02:26:44,108 --> 02:26:44,929
[SPEAKER_15]: That was years ago.

2101
02:26:44,969 --> 02:26:46,230
[SPEAKER_15]: I was in college then, okay?

2102
02:26:46,390 --> 02:26:50,795
[SPEAKER_16]: Last I knew, Zophar was ad-bombed and scary as a result to go to it.

2103
02:26:50,895 --> 02:26:52,477
[SPEAKER_15]: Zophar's gotta be my age.

2104
02:26:53,357 --> 02:26:53,838
[SPEAKER_15]: At least.

2105
02:26:54,258 --> 02:26:55,860
[SPEAKER_15]: He's mid-thirties, for sure.

2106
02:26:56,040 --> 02:26:57,862
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. International House of Roms.

2107
02:26:58,242 --> 02:26:58,463
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck.

2108
02:26:59,023 --> 02:27:02,666
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyhow, to know more about it, please visit the link below.

2109
02:27:02,686 --> 02:27:05,488
[SPEAKER_15]: It has the info, the game trailer, and the patch itself.

2110
02:27:05,568 --> 02:27:07,450
[SPEAKER_15]: So hope it blasts your day.

2111
02:27:07,870 --> 02:27:14,455
[SPEAKER_15]: Now the link here is kind of lengthy, so I'll just tell you to go to Zophar at Z-O-P-H-A-R.net if you didn't already know.

2112
02:27:14,875 --> 02:27:16,856
[SPEAKER_15]: and look for Blaster Remaster.

2113
02:27:17,476 --> 02:27:21,077
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of people in the emulation scene did this shit with Mario Brothers.

2114
02:27:21,297 --> 02:27:22,157
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't tell you.

2115
02:27:22,237 --> 02:27:33,501
[SPEAKER_15]: When hacking and sprite changing, when Nesticle implemented, and yes, that's what it was called, when Nesticle implemented the sprite changing abilities, Super Penis Brothers was out within minutes.

2116
02:27:34,541 --> 02:27:36,742
[SPEAKER_15]: Everybody did basic hacks to the game.

2117
02:27:37,236 --> 02:27:41,739
[SPEAKER_15]: But they got more and more and more in depth and now you've got all these level changes.

2118
02:27:41,939 --> 02:27:46,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you ever remember the Metroid level editor that they made?

2119
02:27:46,622 --> 02:27:46,942
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah.

2120
02:27:47,403 --> 02:27:55,488
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's actually several now whole new versions of Metroid, classic Metroid, that different layouts and everything that are really well done.

2121
02:27:56,431 --> 02:27:57,852
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, thank you for a blast from the past.

2122
02:27:57,912 --> 02:28:02,374
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe it'll be better than that Wii version they did some time ago.

2123
02:28:03,034 --> 02:28:03,474
[SPEAKER_15]: There you go.

2124
02:28:03,554 --> 02:28:05,015
[SPEAKER_15]: Ramaditya from Indonesia.

2125
02:28:05,255 --> 02:28:06,776
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd love being an international show.

2126
02:28:07,936 --> 02:28:08,897
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, moving on.

2127
02:28:09,577 --> 02:28:09,977
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see.

2128
02:28:10,458 --> 02:28:12,979
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's a cheap plug from Travis H.

2129
02:28:13,699 --> 02:28:17,181
[SPEAKER_15]: This is worth mentioning because it has to do with our old favorite pastime.

2130
02:28:17,522 --> 02:28:19,063
[SPEAKER_15]: Travis H sent us a plug here.

2131
02:28:19,743 --> 02:28:25,607
[SPEAKER_15]: I will attempt the DDR marathon record again on November 23rd at 5 a.m.

2132
02:28:25,727 --> 02:28:28,449
[SPEAKER_15]: Eastern to November 24th to 9 p.m.

2133
02:28:28,529 --> 02:28:31,251
[SPEAKER_15]: Eastern, but this time on doubles play.

2134
02:28:33,052 --> 02:28:40,137
[SPEAKER_15]: He links to an event on Facebook and something called CrowdRise.com slash DDR World Record.

2135
02:28:40,637 --> 02:28:42,058
[SPEAKER_15]: So he's doing the record.

2136
02:28:42,599 --> 02:28:43,219
[SPEAKER_15]: Is it for charity?

2137
02:28:43,239 --> 02:28:43,840
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what I want to know.

2138
02:28:43,860 --> 02:28:45,321
[SPEAKER_15]: He's going to do it in Knoxville, Tennessee.

2139
02:28:46,502 --> 02:28:47,022
[SPEAKER_15]: Ah, here we go.

2140
02:28:47,342 --> 02:28:48,163
[SPEAKER_15]: It is for charity.

2141
02:28:48,203 --> 02:28:50,725
[SPEAKER_15]: He raised $1,000 for local charity through the event.

2142
02:28:51,045 --> 02:28:53,127
[SPEAKER_15]: He wants to double his results this year.

2143
02:28:53,627 --> 02:28:55,729
[SPEAKER_15]: Rescue Ministries Meals.

2144
02:28:56,209 --> 02:28:58,711
[SPEAKER_15]: I will be pledging two meals per one hour that I compete.

2145
02:28:59,051 --> 02:29:01,074
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, at least it's for a good cause at the end of the day.

2146
02:29:01,515 --> 02:29:08,524
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I'm all for everybody trying to one-up each other on these marathons and Guinness Book of World Records and stuff when it's for charity.

2147
02:29:08,645 --> 02:29:09,346
[SPEAKER_15]: So, good on you.

2148
02:29:09,666 --> 02:29:11,929
[SPEAKER_15]: Speaking of charity, am I not correct?

2149
02:29:11,969 --> 02:29:14,333
[SPEAKER_15]: Desert Bus started again this weekend.

2150
02:29:14,453 --> 02:29:14,673
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2151
02:29:16,260 --> 02:29:17,061
[SPEAKER_15]: Desert Bust is going.

2152
02:29:17,161 --> 02:29:18,501
[SPEAKER_15]: Umlaut's coming up, of course.

2153
02:29:18,541 --> 02:29:20,223
[SPEAKER_15]: You've heard Jamie talking about that.

2154
02:29:21,023 --> 02:29:22,444
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still working on badges.

2155
02:29:23,204 --> 02:29:24,986
[SPEAKER_15]: It's that time of year for child's play.

2156
02:29:26,026 --> 02:29:29,448
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, I want to let you know that I was watching some Guinness World Records stuff.

2157
02:29:29,789 --> 02:29:31,310
[SPEAKER_07]: They fit 28 women into a mini.

2158
02:29:32,710 --> 02:29:33,011
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

2159
02:29:33,531 --> 02:29:33,751
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

2160
02:29:33,791 --> 02:29:36,373
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, why do people think that this is record worthy?

2161
02:29:37,273 --> 02:29:40,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and the longest note on a didgeridoo was won by a 14-year-old.

2162
02:29:41,036 --> 02:29:41,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Just saying.

2163
02:29:42,990 --> 02:29:44,071
[SPEAKER_15]: I miss didgeridoos.

2164
02:29:46,353 --> 02:29:47,734
[SPEAKER_15]: I miss techno didgeridoo.

2165
02:29:47,774 --> 02:29:48,274
[SPEAKER_15]: Remember that?

2166
02:29:48,334 --> 02:29:49,796
[SPEAKER_15]: That was a thing on OLR years ago.

2167
02:29:50,796 --> 02:29:52,918
[SPEAKER_07]: I wanted to bring up the didgeridoo for that.

2168
02:29:53,178 --> 02:29:53,479
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

2169
02:29:53,779 --> 02:29:55,981
[SPEAKER_16]: Quick charity is something that's interesting.

2170
02:29:56,001 --> 02:30:04,227
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, the reason I mentioned that I've been out here in California for over a week, and I wasn't on last week's show because my employer held a dodgeball charity tournament.

2171
02:30:05,408 --> 02:30:09,672
[SPEAKER_16]: It was basically a who's who of the startups and Silicon Valley startups

2172
02:30:10,052 --> 02:30:13,662
[SPEAKER_16]: mostly San Francisco area competitors and it was a whole hell of a lot of fun.

2173
02:30:14,665 --> 02:30:17,472
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe it was $60,000 for local San Francisco charities.

2174
02:30:17,633 --> 02:30:17,853
[SPEAKER_16]: It was...

2175
02:30:19,626 --> 02:30:22,727
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, Dodgeball, what experience do we have from Dodgeball?

2176
02:30:23,588 --> 02:30:26,048
[SPEAKER_16]: The NES version that was amazing and Jim.

2177
02:30:26,749 --> 02:30:28,869
[SPEAKER_16]: And this was, there were 20 teams.

2178
02:30:28,949 --> 02:30:32,170
[SPEAKER_16]: It was a Neo Geo game too, which was amazing.

2179
02:30:33,211 --> 02:30:37,532
[SPEAKER_16]: 20 teams across 17 businesses.

2180
02:30:38,292 --> 02:30:39,373
[SPEAKER_16]: A whole day's worth of fun.

2181
02:30:39,473 --> 02:30:40,453
[SPEAKER_16]: It was amazing.

2182
02:30:40,693 --> 02:30:44,134
[SPEAKER_16]: And even the World Dodgeball Society came out to officiate it and everything.

2183
02:30:44,514 --> 02:30:45,375
[SPEAKER_15]: It was a great time.

2184
02:30:46,275 --> 02:30:52,421
[SPEAKER_15]: Dodgeball was a fun game, that was one of my favorites growing up Absolutely Alright, you ready to get taken back with this inside joke?

2185
02:30:52,982 --> 02:30:54,944
We're all dancing I want the DDR guy to dance to that

2186
02:31:09,978 --> 02:31:12,487
[SPEAKER_15]: If I'm ever a wrestler, that's the music I'm coming out to.

2187
02:31:13,310 --> 02:31:15,818
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, last email tonight from Elliot B.

2188
02:31:17,028 --> 02:31:19,289
[SPEAKER_15]: Dear OLR, just a quick email here.

2189
02:31:19,709 --> 02:31:26,010
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to celebrate the fact that yesterday was the 10th anniversary of Metroid Prime, my personal favorite game ever.

2190
02:31:26,150 --> 02:31:26,470
[SPEAKER_15]: Really?

2191
02:31:26,791 --> 02:31:27,171
[SPEAKER_15]: 10 years?

2192
02:31:28,071 --> 02:31:28,571
[SPEAKER_15]: Jesus.

2193
02:31:29,131 --> 02:31:32,332
[SPEAKER_15]: I played it again a few weeks ago and it's barely aged a day.

2194
02:31:32,712 --> 02:31:36,113
[SPEAKER_15]: The controls are pitch perfect and the graphics still look good.

2195
02:31:36,533 --> 02:31:41,234
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's hoping the series gets resurrected sometime soon after Metroid Other M's Kiss of Death.

2196
02:31:44,275 --> 02:31:50,158
[SPEAKER_15]: Elliot B. I had no idea that series was 10 years old, but it makes perfect sense.

2197
02:31:50,458 --> 02:32:03,784
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, if Virtual Console on Wii U were to start making GameCube games show up, which isn't outside the realm of possibility, Metroid Prime would sure be a prime candidate to kick things off.

2198
02:32:08,860 --> 02:32:26,060
[SPEAKER_15]: Elliot's regretting that he sent that email right now Anyhow, that's it for emails this week Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com A few more stories for you guys Can we be having the Metroid primaries?

2199
02:32:29,605 --> 02:32:31,428
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, he's really regretting sending that email.

2200
02:32:31,448 --> 02:32:35,554
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, we're going to have an empty mailbag again next week, and we're going to say, why isn't anybody emailing us?

2201
02:32:35,694 --> 02:32:37,737
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah, because we always tell the stupidest jokes.

2202
02:32:37,817 --> 02:32:40,080
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

2203
02:32:40,400 --> 02:32:42,704
[SPEAKER_15]: Now would be an appropriate time to do the FUs of the week.

2204
02:32:59,384 --> 02:33:15,059
[SPEAKER_07]: FU's of the week, DarkSakura FU to me not having a cat I really want a cat My husband says that we can't get a cat until we buy a house So you better hurry up and buy me a house so I can get a cat The end

2205
02:33:17,608 --> 02:33:21,569
[SPEAKER_13]: F you to the utter lack of self-control that I have and my credit card bill next month.

2206
02:33:48,194 --> 02:33:51,316
[SPEAKER_15]: but yay to those reward points.

2207
02:33:51,396 --> 02:33:51,757
[SPEAKER_16]: Jason.

2208
02:33:54,799 --> 02:33:58,482
[SPEAKER_16]: FU to not having a car because we're down to one and Brian actually has to drive to work.

2209
02:33:59,983 --> 02:34:04,366
[SPEAKER_16]: FU to Wells Fargo for reasons that I don't really need to go into but are probably completely obvious.

2210
02:34:04,606 --> 02:34:06,888
[SPEAKER_16]: I can guess based on the FU, yeah.

2211
02:34:06,948 --> 02:34:10,350
[SPEAKER_16]: And related to that, FU to $2 keyboards and $50 computers.

2212
02:34:10,450 --> 02:34:16,355
[SPEAKER_16]: There's, you know, people, places like Wells Fargo that have to buy these cheap-ass little computers because everything just runs on a web browser.

2213
02:34:16,795 --> 02:34:17,896
[SPEAKER_16]: I hate those keyboards.

2214
02:34:18,036 --> 02:34:30,181
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if it's just ingrained to me because I've always worked desk computer keyboard jobs, but holy crap, you have a crappy keyboard and computers become an impossible thing.

2215
02:34:31,602 --> 02:34:40,026
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh man, I did not realize that that's ever something they would say to me.

2216
02:34:40,066 --> 02:34:45,809
[SPEAKER_16]: There's this bridge near Berkeley, north of the Bay Bridge, an overpass rather, north of the Bay Bridge,

2217
02:34:46,549 --> 02:34:52,033
[SPEAKER_16]: And every time I've been out here and come up towards Sacramento, there's a sign up there, Investigate 9-11, Stop the War.

2218
02:34:52,333 --> 02:34:54,594
[SPEAKER_16]: I get the sentiment, but you're still up there.

2219
02:34:54,815 --> 02:34:55,475
[SPEAKER_16]: It's Berkeley.

2220
02:34:56,255 --> 02:34:56,916
[SPEAKER_16]: Just, wow.

2221
02:34:57,056 --> 02:34:58,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Berserkly.

2222
02:35:00,118 --> 02:35:04,141
[SPEAKER_15]: And related to that, FU to... We love Berkeley, but they bring the crazy.

2223
02:35:04,321 --> 02:35:05,301
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's why we love them.

2224
02:35:05,341 --> 02:35:07,303
[SPEAKER_15]: We need a little unpredictability in our life.

2225
02:35:07,423 --> 02:35:13,206
[SPEAKER_16]: And related to that, FU to the coney burned and carved into the hillside that I saw going up here.

2226
02:35:13,687 --> 02:35:15,508
[SPEAKER_15]: How many votes did he end up getting for president?

2227
02:35:18,368 --> 02:35:20,610
[SPEAKER_16]: Wow, what?

2228
02:35:21,191 --> 02:35:23,132
[SPEAKER_16]: Was he on the Colorado ballot like I was talking about?

2229
02:35:23,152 --> 02:35:23,933
[SPEAKER_16]: He might have been.

2230
02:35:23,953 --> 02:35:25,234
[SPEAKER_16]: Did I miss something?

2231
02:35:25,274 --> 02:35:26,715
[SPEAKER_15]: You haven't heard that joke?

2232
02:35:26,775 --> 02:35:30,238
[SPEAKER_15]: I just told the same joke that went around Twitter all day after election.

2233
02:35:30,799 --> 02:35:34,802
[SPEAKER_15]: With all the bumper stickers on cars, how many votes did he get in the election?

2234
02:35:34,862 --> 02:35:36,163
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow, it's actually pretty good.

2235
02:35:37,584 --> 02:35:39,286
[SPEAKER_16]: F you to me for being out of the scene.

2236
02:35:40,748 --> 02:35:49,897
[SPEAKER_16]: Lastly, F you to the Wii U for sometimes just not having button shortcuts, so you have to let go of the controller, tap on the gamepad screen, and just...

2237
02:35:52,599 --> 02:35:55,742
[SPEAKER_16]: It, I'm sure, will be patched, but it's just, it feels weird sometimes.

2238
02:35:55,762 --> 02:35:59,024
[SPEAKER_15]: That's one of those doors that goes into a room where, surprise, it's nothing.

2239
02:35:59,064 --> 02:36:01,586
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't wait for the next 5 gigabyte patch that I'll have.

2240
02:36:02,267 --> 02:36:09,753
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, you owners that have the 8 gigabyte model, you're just not going to be able to have the shortcuts because it's another 5 gigabytes.

2241
02:36:09,773 --> 02:36:10,153
[SPEAKER_13]: Good enough.

2242
02:36:11,987 --> 02:36:14,170
[SPEAKER_15]: I still don't understand.

2243
02:36:14,530 --> 02:36:15,091
[SPEAKER_15]: Me-verse.

2244
02:36:15,351 --> 02:36:18,094
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't just make a post to show all my friends.

2245
02:36:18,214 --> 02:36:28,165
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to post in the... If I want to show my cat, I've got to go to the Mass Effect 3 community and say, Hey, Mass Effect 3 community, I just want to post a picture of my cat.

2246
02:36:28,706 --> 02:36:32,010
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you really want a public Nintendo-operated Twitter clone, though?

2247
02:36:33,693 --> 02:36:44,105
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, well, well, well, it offers me something that Twitter doesn't, and that is hand-drawn stylus messages.

2248
02:36:44,706 --> 02:36:53,336
[SPEAKER_13]: It sounds to me that this whole Miiverse thing is going to kind of devolve into some sort of GameFAQs forum thing.

2249
02:36:54,560 --> 02:37:10,435
[SPEAKER_15]: to be fair it works better than the Vita's thing which I still like I don't like you know the Vita has that whole thing like you can see like what your friends are doing and you can even comment on posts nobody fucking knows it's there you probably don't even know what I'm talking about it's under the achieve

2250
02:37:10,435 --> 02:37:12,417
[SPEAKER_13]: Achievements, create a trophy screen.

2251
02:37:12,497 --> 02:37:18,363
[SPEAKER_15]: No, when you go into the games, you hit the little thing that says down and it shows you the feed like so-and-so just got this game.

2252
02:37:18,704 --> 02:37:20,045
[SPEAKER_15]: So-and-so unlocked a trophy.

2253
02:37:20,165 --> 02:37:23,769
[SPEAKER_15]: And you can actually like or whatever the PlayStation version of like is.

2254
02:37:24,089 --> 02:37:30,196
[SPEAKER_15]: You can like posts and comment and all that shit like it was Facebook, but ain't nobody reading it.

2255
02:37:31,377 --> 02:37:33,318
[SPEAKER_15]: because it's integrated, very shitty.

2256
02:37:33,998 --> 02:37:36,919
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I'm going to go into each individual game I own to look at the feed.

2257
02:37:36,999 --> 02:37:43,722
[SPEAKER_15]: Like that should be, to Nintendo's credit, at least that's the thing that comes up when I turn my Nintendo on.

2258
02:37:44,457 --> 02:37:44,917
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for watching!

2259
02:38:05,191 --> 02:38:09,075
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, Tigerclaw sent me a link saying, are you sure you want this to happen?

2260
02:38:09,135 --> 02:38:14,421
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, of course, you know, ta-da, it's a penis drawn on the Wii U. What a shock.

2261
02:38:14,941 --> 02:38:15,402
[SPEAKER_15]: A series of them.

2262
02:38:15,422 --> 02:38:16,923
[SPEAKER_15]: That looks like multiple penises, actually.

2263
02:38:16,943 --> 02:38:17,464
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a lot.

2264
02:38:17,504 --> 02:38:18,865
[SPEAKER_15]: That is, they're upside down.

2265
02:38:18,905 --> 02:38:19,346
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

2266
02:38:19,386 --> 02:38:20,627
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the banner of dick.

2267
02:38:20,867 --> 02:38:26,233
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just, it's a drawing of an alien planet where mushrooms grow from the ceiling.

2268
02:38:26,413 --> 02:38:27,033
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what it is.

2269
02:38:28,214 --> 02:38:29,675
[SPEAKER_07]: I still call it the banner of dick.

2270
02:38:30,316 --> 02:38:32,277
[SPEAKER_13]: There are cave formations that do look like this.

2271
02:38:32,317 --> 02:38:34,338
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's funny that it's under archery and swordplay.

2272
02:38:41,362 --> 02:38:43,763
[SPEAKER_16]: Well played.

2273
02:38:43,783 --> 02:38:46,225
[SPEAKER_16]: Does that make the TTP two hours and 45 minutes?

2274
02:38:51,227 --> 02:38:53,529
[SPEAKER_13]: This is just one of those shows.

2275
02:38:53,629 --> 02:38:54,649
[SPEAKER_15]: Bravo, JD1.

2276
02:38:56,941 --> 02:38:59,523
[SPEAKER_15]: TigerClaw suggests maybe it is Turian genitalia.

2277
02:39:00,784 --> 02:39:02,806
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that Turian cock looks different than that.

2278
02:39:03,246 --> 02:39:07,870
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that would imply that Turians pull down their pants and it's like an octopus down there.

2279
02:39:08,350 --> 02:39:11,653
[SPEAKER_07]: From those drawings, that would imply that Turians have foreskins.

2280
02:39:13,815 --> 02:39:15,857
[SPEAKER_15]: Moving on and quickly.

2281
02:39:17,313 --> 02:39:18,754
[SPEAKER_15]: Loki, what do you have for us?

2282
02:39:19,575 --> 02:39:25,098
[SPEAKER_15]: Before we get, we're up almost to the Skype line at 1-877-GAME-OLR or on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2283
02:39:25,118 --> 02:39:26,619
[SPEAKER_15]: We're almost there, but not just yet.

2284
02:39:26,699 --> 02:39:30,422
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't have banners of cocks unless that's a new game franchise that they're going to put out.

2285
02:39:30,442 --> 02:39:30,982
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, get out!

2286
02:39:32,183 --> 02:39:37,306
[SPEAKER_13]: But Ubisoft is, you know, they may be interested in THQ's assets.

2287
02:39:38,227 --> 02:39:42,170
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, you know, their boss, was it Vess?

2288
02:39:42,470 --> 02:39:44,571
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not even going to try to pronounce it.

2289
02:39:44,691 --> 02:39:45,132
[SPEAKER_13]: French guy.

2290
02:39:45,552 --> 02:39:45,832
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways.

2291
02:39:47,453 --> 02:39:55,765
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyways, he basically said, yeah, they're always interested in good brands, and it may be something they can consider buying some of the IP from.

2292
02:39:57,328 --> 02:40:01,554
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's just all speculation, the kind of going, reaching out to people, saying, hey, you know...

2293
02:40:03,052 --> 02:40:10,739
[SPEAKER_13]: What do you think THQ's assets impact is going to be on the Neo Geo console or the Dreamcast or something like that?

2294
02:40:12,641 --> 02:40:14,583
[SPEAKER_13]: But they're just kind of reaching.

2295
02:40:15,263 --> 02:40:18,286
[SPEAKER_13]: Obviously, if they struggle enough, then they're going to try to sell off IP.

2296
02:40:18,306 --> 02:40:21,849
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think they've already sold off IP or at least stopped making stuff.

2297
02:40:22,770 --> 02:40:26,854
[SPEAKER_13]: I know they're still sitting on a bunch of those Udraw tablets, that's for sure.

2298
02:40:26,874 --> 02:40:27,775
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

2299
02:40:29,412 --> 02:40:30,193
[SPEAKER_13]: But I don't know.

2300
02:40:30,293 --> 02:40:36,837
[SPEAKER_13]: I think right now they've kind of limited it down to what they're going to work with and they're going to make some quality games based on it.

2301
02:40:36,877 --> 02:40:38,739
[SPEAKER_13]: Or at least they're going to try and fail.

2302
02:40:39,659 --> 02:40:41,421
[SPEAKER_13]: But we'll see.

2303
02:40:42,341 --> 02:40:44,563
[SPEAKER_16]: I tell you one IP they're not interested in right now.

2304
02:40:45,403 --> 02:40:46,184
[SPEAKER_16]: UFC Undisputed.

2305
02:40:47,084 --> 02:40:48,185
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's not theirs anymore.

2306
02:40:49,406 --> 02:40:50,287
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be EA.

2307
02:40:51,848 --> 02:40:51,948
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh.

2308
02:40:54,740 --> 02:40:56,282
[SPEAKER_13]: Kill that joke.

2309
02:40:56,302 --> 02:40:59,665
[SPEAKER_13]: They aren't interested in it because EA bought it already.

2310
02:41:02,728 --> 02:41:03,449
[SPEAKER_15]: Alrighty then.

2311
02:41:06,385 --> 02:41:34,181
[SPEAKER_15]: I got one more story for you guys and you know I know this I know that this is the reason that you guys tune into Orange Lounge Radio is that you want to have your news on Beyonce and I've got your Beyonce news for you right here and it has to do with that lawsuit that was going on between Beyonce and Gate 5 this was that whole thing about Superstar Beyonce the game that was going to happen and then she backed out of the deal so

2312
02:41:36,343 --> 02:41:36,903
[SPEAKER_15]: Here it is now.

2313
02:41:36,963 --> 02:41:43,369
[SPEAKER_15]: The appeal of the judgment where Beyonce's lawyers tried to basically get it thrown out.

2314
02:41:43,389 --> 02:41:47,452
[SPEAKER_15]: They wanted a summary judgment in April saying the Gate 5 didn't pull in the financing.

2315
02:41:47,753 --> 02:41:48,934
[SPEAKER_15]: That appeal failed.

2316
02:41:49,194 --> 02:41:55,079
[SPEAKER_15]: This doesn't mean Beyonce has lost, but this means we're going to get the trial of the century.

2317
02:41:55,219 --> 02:41:59,263
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to go to trial, and a jury will determine if they don't settle first.

2318
02:41:59,503 --> 02:42:03,006
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's just like, trial of the century, call of duty, and settle.

2319
02:42:03,346 --> 02:42:09,429
[SPEAKER_15]: or a jury will have to determine if Beyonce was within her contract to leave the project or if she broke the agreement.

2320
02:42:09,829 --> 02:42:11,950
[SPEAKER_15]: So we could get a trial out of this.

2321
02:42:11,990 --> 02:42:12,851
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be kind of fun.

2322
02:42:12,971 --> 02:42:13,791
[SPEAKER_15]: Probably won't, though.

2323
02:42:13,811 --> 02:42:14,532
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it'll settle.

2324
02:42:14,672 --> 02:42:15,332
[SPEAKER_15]: You know it'll settle.

2325
02:42:18,544 --> 02:42:20,846
[SPEAKER_13]: But all I gotta say is, man, two keytars?

2326
02:42:21,106 --> 02:42:21,947
[SPEAKER_13]: That's just fancy.

2327
02:42:21,987 --> 02:42:22,828
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, that's awesome.

2328
02:42:22,928 --> 02:42:30,274
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's the thing, is that we're looking at this little picture of Beyonce doing her little sachet, and her one keyboard girl's really into it over here, but look at this one.

2329
02:42:30,934 --> 02:42:33,216
[SPEAKER_15]: This one that looks like Juliette Lewis with blonde hair.

2330
02:42:33,336 --> 02:42:36,839
[SPEAKER_13]: She looks like the chick from Mean Girls or whatever.

2331
02:42:37,419 --> 02:42:39,441
[SPEAKER_13]: No, not Mean Girls, I'm sorry.

2332
02:42:39,481 --> 02:42:42,243
[SPEAKER_13]: She looks like the chick from Glee, the one that always has the blank...

2333
02:42:42,483 --> 02:42:43,603
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, Brittany!

2334
02:42:43,643 --> 02:42:44,924
[SPEAKER_13]: Why do I know that?

2335
02:42:45,184 --> 02:42:46,104
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, God!

2336
02:42:46,224 --> 02:42:46,604
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

2337
02:42:46,664 --> 02:42:49,205
[SPEAKER_07]: I can safely say I've never seen an episode of that show.

2338
02:42:49,225 --> 02:42:50,065
[SPEAKER_15]: I am so gay.

2339
02:42:51,306 --> 02:42:52,226
[SPEAKER_15]: And I can say that.

2340
02:42:52,826 --> 02:42:53,186
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, no.

2341
02:42:53,566 --> 02:42:59,868
[SPEAKER_13]: I watched part of the series, at least the first few seasons, just because it was by the guy that did Nip Tuck, although that series was weird.

2342
02:43:00,709 --> 02:43:04,110
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, I got out of it after about, I think, a couple seasons.

2343
02:43:04,170 --> 02:43:05,750
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen one episode of Nip Tuck.

2344
02:43:05,790 --> 02:43:08,091
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where they put all the liposuction fat in the woman's car.

2345
02:43:09,639 --> 02:43:10,340
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the only episode I've seen.

2346
02:43:10,360 --> 02:43:11,400
[SPEAKER_15]: That could be any episode, really.

2347
02:43:11,440 --> 02:43:12,922
[SPEAKER_15]: American Horror Story is much better.

2348
02:43:13,542 --> 02:43:14,022
[SPEAKER_15]: It's messed up.

2349
02:43:14,062 --> 02:43:14,643
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that also him?

2350
02:43:14,983 --> 02:43:15,624
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's also him.

2351
02:43:16,004 --> 02:43:16,364
[SPEAKER_15]: Much better.

2352
02:43:16,384 --> 02:43:23,089
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, if you like the FX show, you'll like American Horror Story, which is also an FX show, just so you know.

2353
02:43:23,890 --> 02:43:24,190
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

2354
02:43:25,091 --> 02:43:26,011
[SPEAKER_15]: They're on season two, even.

2355
02:43:27,512 --> 02:43:35,458
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, yes, so, after all that Beyonce and Glee news, we can finally go back to video games And your phone calls!

2356
02:43:35,658 --> 02:43:52,169
[SPEAKER_15]: Skype line's open right now, 1-877-1-877-GAME-OLR Or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, all one word I'll get to the Twitter topics here in just a moment, but I thought I'd check in with Loki first to see if there's any last minute stories

2357
02:43:52,506 --> 02:43:53,246
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, this is kind of weird.

2358
02:43:53,307 --> 02:44:00,871
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess Nintendo, for your Nintendo ID, if you're a minor, requires a credit card verification that's going to cost you 50 cents.

2359
02:44:01,031 --> 02:44:05,314
[SPEAKER_13]: Which leads to the question, why don't you just say you're an adult if you're a minor?

2360
02:44:06,375 --> 02:44:08,376
[SPEAKER_13]: Save the fee and the hassle.

2361
02:44:08,936 --> 02:44:11,498
[SPEAKER_13]: Which I'm sure most people will probably do.

2362
02:44:12,739 --> 02:44:15,081
[SPEAKER_16]: I wonder if that's a permanent thing, because stuff like that is usually refunded.

2363
02:44:15,121 --> 02:44:18,464
[SPEAKER_15]: Because Loki, Reggie doesn't like liars.

2364
02:44:18,965 --> 02:44:26,692
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh yeah, I'm sure that all those kids too are very truthful when it comes to those age-gated videos as well.

2365
02:44:26,912 --> 02:44:33,699
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sure no one says that they were born in the current date, 1900 or something like that.

2366
02:44:34,079 --> 02:44:37,022
[SPEAKER_15]: When you go to Xtube.com, sure I was January 1st, 1900.

2367
02:44:38,203 --> 02:44:38,803
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, exactly.

2368
02:44:38,943 --> 02:44:40,504
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, we got a call on the line.

2369
02:44:41,104 --> 02:44:42,704
[SPEAKER_15]: Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

2370
02:44:43,684 --> 02:44:44,805
[SPEAKER_15]: Ranma's back again.

2371
02:44:44,865 --> 02:44:45,465
[SPEAKER_15]: You again.

2372
02:44:45,545 --> 02:44:46,125
[SPEAKER_15]: Gotta go.

2373
02:44:46,225 --> 02:44:46,865
[SPEAKER_15]: Have a nice day.

2374
02:44:46,925 --> 02:44:47,325
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I'm kidding.

2375
02:44:47,365 --> 02:44:47,906
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey!

2376
02:44:48,006 --> 02:44:48,866
[SPEAKER_15]: What's up, buddy?

2377
02:44:49,966 --> 02:44:50,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Not much.

2378
02:44:51,887 --> 02:45:00,029
[SPEAKER_15]: You did bring Reggie to OLR and ask him a really dumb question, and I mean that in like a showgirls is dumb but I love it kind of way.

2379
02:45:02,810 --> 02:45:03,830
[SPEAKER_15]: So, what's up, buddy?

2380
02:45:05,103 --> 02:45:32,399
[SPEAKER_04]: something interesting that happened with GameStop and now with their current set of pre-orders it seems that my brother he went to pre-order his Wii paid off in full he was going to have issues picking it up because of work and the store that's open and the whole 48 hours thing he was pretty much was told more or less that if he doesn't pick it up in 48 hours they're going to give it to somebody else

2381
02:45:34,816 --> 02:45:46,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, it seems that due to an issue with the release of Assassin's Creed, it doesn't matter if you pre-order your game or console paid in full or not.

2382
02:45:47,125 --> 02:45:49,166
[SPEAKER_04]: If somebody wants it, they can have it.

2383
02:45:51,089 --> 02:45:51,870
[SPEAKER_15]: No, but the thing is that...

2384
02:46:10,523 --> 02:46:13,867
[SPEAKER_04]: GameStop has now what's called no person left behind.

2385
02:46:14,367 --> 02:46:21,273
[SPEAKER_04]: So that guarantees, even if you pre-order it, paid for it in full, if it's the last copy, you're coming to pick it up.

2386
02:46:21,714 --> 02:46:29,541
[SPEAKER_04]: If someone beats you by 10 minutes, even though that's your copy, that other person can walk out the store with it and you'll have to wait until the next shipment.

2387
02:46:30,001 --> 02:46:33,044
[SPEAKER_04]: And depending on the game, don't know when it's coming.

2388
02:46:33,144 --> 02:46:34,846
[SPEAKER_13]: Then why are you pre-ordering?

2389
02:46:36,853 --> 02:46:38,634
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my point, exactly.

2390
02:46:39,254 --> 02:46:42,535
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, yeah, I mean, I've never been a big fan of the pre-order system at all.

2391
02:46:42,595 --> 02:46:46,777
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't think of the last thing I pre-ordered, and that's how I voice my opinion.

2392
02:46:46,897 --> 02:46:47,777
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't participate.

2393
02:46:48,177 --> 02:46:57,200
[SPEAKER_15]: You didn't pre-order a Wii U. I did not pre-order a Wii U. I'm not sitting here going nanny nanny poo poo, I found one anyway, but I did find one anyway.

2394
02:46:58,461 --> 02:47:01,081
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, like, it could happen.

2395
02:47:01,462 --> 02:47:02,642
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, you probably couldn't do it now.

2396
02:47:02,742 --> 02:47:04,783
[SPEAKER_15]: Now that the day is over, I don't think you're going to find one, but...

2397
02:47:06,284 --> 02:47:09,487
[SPEAKER_15]: They're supposedly putting them out more frequently.

2398
02:47:09,827 --> 02:47:11,649
[SPEAKER_15]: But, okay, I gotta go back to this.

2399
02:47:11,829 --> 02:47:14,552
[SPEAKER_15]: So why couldn't your friend get there within 48 hours?

2400
02:47:16,728 --> 02:47:17,248
[SPEAKER_04]: My bro.

2401
02:47:17,468 --> 02:47:18,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, your brother.

2402
02:47:19,130 --> 02:47:20,070
[SPEAKER_04]: It's work schedule.

2403
02:47:20,591 --> 02:47:25,214
[SPEAKER_04]: The GameStop, he was able to pick it up, but today they were open from 11 to 6.

2404
02:47:26,015 --> 02:47:29,618
[SPEAKER_04]: He works 11 to 7, and he's a 45-minute drive away.

2405
02:47:31,019 --> 02:47:31,560
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, okay.

2406
02:47:31,800 --> 02:47:35,803
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, that makes sense, and especially with all the shenanigans that have happened out there back east.

2407
02:47:36,343 --> 02:47:38,525
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I'm sure they're still cleaning up some of the roads.

2408
02:47:41,367 --> 02:47:42,388
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get me started about that.

2409
02:47:42,448 --> 02:47:44,450
[SPEAKER_15]: Are they still rationing the gas and all that shit?

2410
02:47:45,579 --> 02:47:48,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and New York City, I think they still are.

2411
02:47:48,901 --> 02:47:49,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

2412
02:47:49,722 --> 02:47:51,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have to double check with that.

2413
02:47:51,162 --> 02:47:51,543
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow.

2414
02:47:52,163 --> 02:47:59,827
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, sorry, didn't mean to change the topic on you, but I do feel like this isn't the first I've heard of this policy.

2415
02:48:00,048 --> 02:48:08,673
[SPEAKER_15]: I do want to say GameStop has kind of done this before, where it's like, well, if you don't show up to get your stuff, we are going to give it to a customer who's willing to, you know, show up and pay for it.

2416
02:48:08,973 --> 02:48:10,053
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not saying it makes it right.

2417
02:48:10,454 --> 02:48:12,695
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just saying I don't think this is necessarily...

2418
02:48:13,235 --> 02:48:22,846
[SPEAKER_15]: News, but when we're talking about a $350 console that it's happening with, it does sting a hell of a lot more than some $40 game.

2419
02:48:23,727 --> 02:48:24,327
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.

2420
02:48:24,367 --> 02:48:25,789
[SPEAKER_13]: Stop shopping at GameStop!

2421
02:48:25,889 --> 02:48:27,271
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, it had to be said.

2422
02:48:27,911 --> 02:48:29,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, you are absolutely correct.

2423
02:48:29,313 --> 02:48:30,794
[SPEAKER_04]: This is why I shop at Best Buy.

2424
02:48:30,814 --> 02:48:32,997
[SPEAKER_04]: They give you at least two weeks to pick up your stuff.

2425
02:48:34,153 --> 02:48:38,777
[SPEAKER_15]: Or shit, Walmart had that whole layaway thing where you'd have to tell Christmas Day to come get it.

2426
02:48:38,877 --> 02:48:42,199
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, you got to look at the other options.

2427
02:48:42,840 --> 02:48:43,420
[SPEAKER_15]: Exactly.

2428
02:48:43,620 --> 02:48:45,221
[SPEAKER_15]: Or Target's where I looked out today.

2429
02:48:45,682 --> 02:48:47,403
[SPEAKER_15]: Did I talk about that during the show?

2430
02:48:47,503 --> 02:48:51,126
[SPEAKER_15]: I use the Target app on iPhone to see because you can check inventories.

2431
02:48:51,626 --> 02:48:56,550
[SPEAKER_15]: And I saw that there was one, not my closest Target, but the second closest one had them in stock.

2432
02:48:58,407 --> 02:49:03,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I was discussing, more or less discussing, arguing with another person that works at GameStop.

2433
02:49:03,752 --> 02:49:13,721
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, look, if I paid for my Wii U in full, and when I get there, it's not there, that's theft.

2434
02:49:14,562 --> 02:49:20,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Me personally, at that point, I will want a full refund of what I paid, and I'm going somewhere else to pick up my console.

2435
02:49:20,926 --> 02:49:24,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this other person is arguing, it's not theft because you're still going to get it.

2436
02:49:24,368 --> 02:49:31,432
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, yes it is, since you pretty much guaranteed me one, that last one belongs to me, and not nobody else.

2437
02:49:33,624 --> 02:49:38,065
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's rough.

2438
02:49:38,245 --> 02:49:41,706
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't make a fairness claim because it's not fair to anyone.

2439
02:49:42,626 --> 02:49:49,368
[SPEAKER_16]: It's nice that they will be willing to give it up eventually, that they give you a window.

2440
02:49:49,868 --> 02:49:51,929
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so I'm talking primarily Wii U right now.

2441
02:49:51,969 --> 02:49:55,610
[SPEAKER_16]: You said 48 hours, but it doesn't really cover what you were talking about.

2442
02:49:55,690 --> 02:49:56,430
[SPEAKER_16]: Assassin's Creed 3, it's...

2443
02:49:57,270 --> 02:49:57,951
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

2444
02:49:57,991 --> 02:50:05,938
[SPEAKER_04]: What I mean to say was because of what happened with Assassin's Creed 3, people who pre-ordered didn't get it because it went to other people.

2445
02:50:06,198 --> 02:50:09,241
[SPEAKER_04]: So an email came from corporate from that no person left behind.

2446
02:50:09,481 --> 02:50:12,064
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it matter about the 40-hour rule is...

2447
02:50:13,425 --> 02:50:16,830
[SPEAKER_04]: No longer in effect, even though there's still some stores that are still doing it.

2448
02:50:31,008 --> 02:50:32,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's exactly what it is.

2449
02:50:32,450 --> 02:50:34,932
[SPEAKER_15]: I get that from a business perspective.

2450
02:50:35,573 --> 02:50:37,495
[SPEAKER_15]: I totally get that from a business perspective.

2451
02:50:37,535 --> 02:50:41,739
[SPEAKER_15]: But here's the question that a lot of companies don't always assess properly.

2452
02:50:42,320 --> 02:50:49,407
[SPEAKER_15]: At what customer service sacrifice are you going to imply that business perspective?

2453
02:50:49,447 --> 02:50:50,709
[SPEAKER_15]: It's about finding balance.

2454
02:50:51,556 --> 02:50:54,137
[SPEAKER_16]: and GameStop's opinion, obviously at the price of $50, $60.

2455
02:50:55,377 --> 02:50:57,938
[SPEAKER_15]: GameStop can lose a few customers and still make a profit.

2456
02:50:57,978 --> 02:51:00,018
[SPEAKER_15]: At the same time, though, they did just close 20 stores.

2457
02:51:00,398 --> 02:51:04,679
[SPEAKER_15]: So maybe they're not in the best position to be turning people away, but I don't know.

2458
02:51:05,620 --> 02:51:10,541
[SPEAKER_15]: At the same time, they pissed your brother off, potentially, but they would have made someone else very happy.

2459
02:51:11,181 --> 02:51:11,501
[SPEAKER_04]: True.

2460
02:51:11,842 --> 02:51:13,863
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, I'm not saying it's right.

2461
02:51:13,963 --> 02:51:17,966
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just trying to weigh the different sides of it and look at the business perspective.

2462
02:51:18,326 --> 02:51:18,586
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

2463
02:51:19,327 --> 02:51:22,669
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're right because I worked retail for like 15 plus years.

2464
02:51:22,970 --> 02:51:24,691
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean I see the business side of it.

2465
02:51:24,851 --> 02:51:27,253
[SPEAKER_04]: I also see the customer side of things.

2466
02:51:27,513 --> 02:51:32,857
[SPEAKER_04]: If it was me personally, if I knew the person and it was like – I would do my best to hold it for them.

2467
02:51:32,997 --> 02:51:35,659
[SPEAKER_04]: But my manager is telling me give it to the next person.

2468
02:51:35,999 --> 02:51:36,540
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2469
02:51:54,079 --> 02:51:56,860
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, I want to come get my system, but I can't.

2470
02:51:57,120 --> 02:52:00,742
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I have an extension until such and such reasonable time?

2471
02:52:01,022 --> 02:52:03,923
[SPEAKER_15]: Reasonable being within another 48 hours or whatever.

2472
02:52:04,284 --> 02:52:06,524
[SPEAKER_15]: Then grant them the stinking extension.

2473
02:52:06,825 --> 02:52:09,806
[SPEAKER_15]: But if a person no call no shows, then give their shit away.

2474
02:52:10,486 --> 02:52:12,167
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's a fair compromise.

2475
02:52:12,927 --> 02:52:13,207
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

2476
02:52:13,448 --> 02:52:13,768
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

2477
02:52:14,728 --> 02:52:21,157
[SPEAKER_04]: But as you can see, GameStop's all about making that, I mean, ShameStop's all about making that green dollar buck.

2478
02:52:21,478 --> 02:52:24,842
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, well, and I don't know what, I'm just some schmo with a podcast.

2479
02:52:24,922 --> 02:52:25,984
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know what I'm talking about.

2480
02:52:26,653 --> 02:52:27,834
[SPEAKER_15]: I know, right?

2481
02:52:29,335 --> 02:52:32,217
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, well, we gotta let you go, buddy, but any quick final thoughts for us?

2482
02:52:33,177 --> 02:52:34,578
[SPEAKER_15]: No, but stay fabulous.

2483
02:52:34,878 --> 02:52:37,360
[SPEAKER_15]: I will, and stay black, and thank you for all your hard work this week.

2484
02:52:37,880 --> 02:52:38,961
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, no problem, that's what we're here for.

2485
02:52:39,081 --> 02:52:41,562
[SPEAKER_15]: And pass along thank you to Taiki as well, of course.

2486
02:52:42,083 --> 02:52:42,443
[SPEAKER_16]: Will do.

2487
02:52:42,583 --> 02:52:43,103
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, bye-bye.

2488
02:52:44,084 --> 02:52:46,085
[SPEAKER_16]: And be sure to prepare yourself for the physical cliff.

2489
02:52:48,968 --> 02:52:49,949
[SPEAKER_15]: 1-877-GAME-OLR.

2490
02:52:50,830 --> 02:52:53,753
[SPEAKER_15]: Ain't no one getting a Wii U if that thing doesn't get resolved, right?

2491
02:52:54,233 --> 02:52:54,613
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

2492
02:52:54,633 --> 02:52:58,698
[SPEAKER_15]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.

2493
02:52:58,818 --> 02:52:59,538
[SPEAKER_15]: All one word.

2494
02:53:00,620 --> 02:53:02,542
[SPEAKER_15]: Any other last minute stories or should I get some tweets?

2495
02:53:04,564 --> 02:53:05,805
[SPEAKER_13]: Just kind of some random stuff.

2496
02:53:05,845 --> 02:53:08,167
[SPEAKER_13]: Tom Hardy's going to be in the Splinter Cell movie.

2497
02:53:08,187 --> 02:53:08,808
[SPEAKER_13]: She mentioned that.

2498
02:53:09,790 --> 02:53:10,671
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I wasn't listening.

2499
02:53:11,252 --> 02:53:13,214
[SPEAKER_13]: I just thought I'd mention it again because Tom Hardy's awesome.

2500
02:53:13,575 --> 02:53:16,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Although I have yet to see the last Batman movie.

2501
02:53:17,139 --> 02:53:17,580
[SPEAKER_13]: Me too.

2502
02:53:17,620 --> 02:53:18,161
[SPEAKER_13]: I really need to.

2503
02:53:18,481 --> 02:53:20,483
[SPEAKER_15]: Or Avengers.

2504
02:53:20,644 --> 02:53:22,005
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I said this on the show already.

2505
02:53:22,085 --> 02:53:27,092
[SPEAKER_15]: The last Batman movie was great, but Tom Hardy's Bane, it really creeped me out how he sounded like Count Von Count.

2506
02:53:28,092 --> 02:53:30,734
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to destroy Gotham City!

2507
02:53:30,754 --> 02:53:33,076
[SPEAKER_13]: He sounded Belgian to me.

2508
02:53:33,856 --> 02:53:37,899
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if you've seen that YouTube video series now.

2509
02:53:37,939 --> 02:53:41,121
[SPEAKER_13]: They have Tom Hardy reading the cans of Monster Energy drink.

2510
02:53:42,061 --> 02:53:43,302
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I haven't seen that.

2511
02:53:43,682 --> 02:54:11,347
[SPEAKER_15]: you need to find that it's hilarious Tom Hardy is hot as hell well it's not Tom Hardy it's Bane it's Tom Hardy's Bane reading the one fish two fish alright we got another call coming in let's go to the phones hi you are on Orange Launch Radio who's this it's Amiga 777 I'm sorry say that again you are a little bit quiet Amiga 777 Amiga 777 now I can hear you buddy what's on your mind

[SPEAKER_17]: Basically, the Wii U launch.

2513
02:54:17,846 --> 02:54:18,306
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2514
02:54:20,707 --> 02:54:27,290
[SPEAKER_17]: Last night I was out, you know, just driving around seeing if there was anyone, you know, who might have been camping.

2515
02:54:28,270 --> 02:54:33,253
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, out in anticipation or pre-orders, anything like that.

2516
02:54:35,214 --> 02:54:37,515
[SPEAKER_17]: I couldn't find really anybody.

2517
02:54:37,595 --> 02:54:38,375
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like if they...

2518
02:54:47,428 --> 02:54:52,329
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I think a lot more stores did pre-orders this time, which was very different from last time.

2519
02:54:53,090 --> 02:55:06,674
[SPEAKER_15]: In 2006, I remember because we drove around and looked at all the lines, and we participated in a line at Target, and there was a line at Walmart, there was a line at Best Buy, there was a line at Toys R Us, there was a line at Circuit City.

2520
02:55:07,074 --> 02:55:08,815
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, we all know why there wasn't a line there this year.

2521
02:55:09,295 --> 02:55:12,038
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2522
02:55:31,716 --> 02:55:33,877
[SPEAKER_15]: But I sure did see some interesting tweets.

2523
02:55:34,377 --> 02:55:36,978
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, it's Twitter, so take it with a grain of salt.

2524
02:55:37,278 --> 02:55:46,882
[SPEAKER_15]: But I saw somebody on Twitter who said there was a line at Walmart and the third person in line bought all the remaining Wii U's and pissed everybody else off in line.

2525
02:55:47,222 --> 02:55:48,963
[SPEAKER_15]: Because you know she was going to flip them on eBay.

2526
02:55:49,543 --> 02:55:50,624
[SPEAKER_15]: And actually...

2527
02:55:51,184 --> 02:55:58,948
[SPEAKER_15]: The clerk I had at Target today said somebody tried to come in and do the same thing, and they said no, because they had a policy on these items to sell only one.

2528
02:55:59,248 --> 02:56:01,949
[SPEAKER_15]: And I said, good, because you know those are just going to end up on eBay.

2529
02:56:01,989 --> 02:56:06,731
[SPEAKER_15]: And he's like, yeah, they need to do something about those eBay flippers.

2530
02:56:06,771 --> 02:56:07,752
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, hell yeah they do.

2531
02:56:08,552 --> 02:56:11,333
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyway, sorry, I got a little tangenty.

2532
02:56:11,393 --> 02:56:12,454
[SPEAKER_15]: So you didn't find any lines?

2533
02:56:14,635 --> 02:56:18,857
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I mean, I was looking for campers late at night, just waiting.

2534
02:56:18,877 --> 02:56:19,417
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like,

2535
02:56:20,273 --> 02:56:21,717
[SPEAKER_17]: I was like, where is everybody?

2536
02:56:22,018 --> 02:56:23,341
[SPEAKER_15]: They all went to New York City.

2537
02:56:23,582 --> 02:56:25,266
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought this was a big deal.

2538
02:56:27,031 --> 02:56:27,171
[SPEAKER_17]: And...

2539
02:56:28,812 --> 02:56:32,474
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm getting a text message correcting me from somebody listening right now.

2540
02:56:33,194 --> 02:56:34,995
[SPEAKER_15]: They did do pre-orders at Target.

2541
02:56:35,996 --> 02:56:38,557
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, well, shit, they didn't do enough then.

2542
02:56:38,757 --> 02:56:39,517
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't realize they did.

2543
02:56:39,698 --> 02:56:41,438
[SPEAKER_16]: Apparently not to sell out their first-run stock.

2544
02:56:41,498 --> 02:56:42,619
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that's weird.

2545
02:56:42,659 --> 02:56:45,941
[SPEAKER_15]: They must have done them real late in the game because I didn't see anything on the website or nothing.

2546
02:56:46,001 --> 02:56:49,503
[SPEAKER_15]: But all right, I'll take his word for it.

2547
02:56:49,923 --> 02:56:51,804
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe they didn't all do it, too.

2548
02:56:51,824 --> 02:56:52,644
[SPEAKER_15]: It could have been certain ones.

2549
02:56:52,724 --> 02:56:53,104
[SPEAKER_15]: But anyway...

2550
02:56:54,745 --> 02:56:57,346
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe the time to have seen the line would have been earlier today.

2551
02:56:57,606 --> 02:56:57,966
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

2552
02:56:58,426 --> 02:57:03,867
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, it's kind of a bummer the line thing didn't happen because there was a lot of community that came with it.

2553
02:57:04,088 --> 02:57:05,528
[SPEAKER_15]: Jamie, I know you had a real fun time.

2554
02:57:05,968 --> 02:57:11,770
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I don't know about real fun, but you had a well enough time in the line just kind of talking to people, right?

2555
02:57:11,890 --> 02:57:13,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but it did get kind of boring.

2556
02:57:13,860 --> 02:57:14,220
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah.

2557
02:57:14,861 --> 02:57:16,041
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I got really sleepy.

2558
02:57:16,081 --> 02:57:18,062
[SPEAKER_15]: At four in the morning, it starts to get old.

2559
02:57:18,362 --> 02:57:20,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and then there was the woman who showed up like after all of us.

2560
02:57:20,723 --> 02:57:22,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone who waited got a Wii.

2561
02:57:23,184 --> 02:57:25,525
[SPEAKER_07]: The one woman who just showed up at five in the morning?

2562
02:57:25,985 --> 02:57:26,185
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

2563
02:57:27,266 --> 02:57:27,406
[SPEAKER_15]: Aw.

2564
02:57:27,706 --> 02:57:29,027
[SPEAKER_15]: Five in the morning is still really early.

2565
02:57:29,627 --> 02:57:32,048
[SPEAKER_15]: I walked in there at 1030 and got a Wii U today.

2566
02:57:32,348 --> 02:57:32,528
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

2567
02:57:33,209 --> 02:57:34,569
[SPEAKER_15]: Amiga, enough about us.

2568
02:57:34,949 --> 02:57:35,630
[SPEAKER_15]: How about you?

2569
02:57:35,790 --> 02:57:37,410
[SPEAKER_15]: You went around and looked at all these lines.

2570
02:57:37,991 --> 02:57:40,832
[SPEAKER_15]: Is the Wii U something you were interested in picking up or no?

2571
02:57:42,779 --> 02:57:52,107
[SPEAKER_17]: Kind of, sort of, you know, just really curious, you know, just, you know, it's a new system from Nintendo and I'm just hearing a lot about it.

2572
02:57:54,088 --> 02:58:11,722
[SPEAKER_17]: Currently, you know, don't quite have the funds to get one of my own at this time, but, you know, I was taken with all the hype behind it, you know, and Reggie sees amazing on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon a couple nights ago.

2573
02:58:11,963 --> 02:58:12,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Mm-hmm.

2574
02:58:14,305 --> 02:58:19,831
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought I was going to be seeing a lot of avid fans of Nintendo.

2575
02:58:21,553 --> 02:58:30,943
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess instead, I saw it as Nintendo probably just planning a light launch or something like that.

2576
02:58:31,343 --> 02:58:35,688
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think me and maybe others might have anticipated it.

2577
02:58:36,525 --> 02:59:06,177
[SPEAKER_15]: maybe it's something that will really start to gear up through 2013 oh yeah you do talk about the light launch and we didn't see a lot of commercials this year either I mean there was like the occasional movie screen commercial that I caught but like there's not really been the TV commercials or that whole like what they did last time with the we would like to play I think and I heard this theory on Bobby's show and it seems perfectly reasonable to me they're just saving all that money to market them next year after Christmas makes sense to me

2578
02:59:07,373 --> 02:59:09,794
[SPEAKER_16]: or after Thanksgiving, the bigger holiday rush.

2579
02:59:10,094 --> 02:59:10,534
[SPEAKER_15]: Either or.

2580
02:59:10,954 --> 02:59:13,995
[SPEAKER_15]: But just why blow all the money now when all your pre-orders sold out?

2581
02:59:14,655 --> 02:59:15,715
[SPEAKER_15]: Who do you have to advertise to?

2582
02:59:16,095 --> 02:59:17,356
[SPEAKER_15]: Let the word of mouth do its thing.

2583
02:59:19,536 --> 02:59:20,557
[SPEAKER_17]: Very true.

2584
02:59:20,757 --> 02:59:21,137
[SPEAKER_15]: Very true.

2585
02:59:21,377 --> 02:59:24,598
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, Amiga77, I hope you're able to get one if you want one.

2586
02:59:24,998 --> 02:59:27,478
[SPEAKER_15]: Hopefully, maybe your luck will turn around around the holidays.

2587
02:59:27,899 --> 02:59:29,379
[SPEAKER_15]: But thanks so much for calling the show, alright?

2588
02:59:30,754 --> 02:59:32,435
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, take care, buddy.

2589
02:59:32,615 --> 02:59:32,775
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.

2590
02:59:33,616 --> 02:59:33,936
[SPEAKER_15]: Bye-bye.

2591
02:59:36,117 --> 02:59:36,798
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for the call.

2592
02:59:36,938 --> 02:59:38,299
[SPEAKER_15]: I haven't heard from him in a long time.

2593
02:59:38,579 --> 02:59:41,961
[SPEAKER_15]: Appreciate hearing from some callers we don't hear from all the time.

2594
02:59:42,781 --> 02:59:45,503
[SPEAKER_15]: TigerClaw in chat says, I haven't seen any Wii U commercials.

2595
02:59:45,563 --> 02:59:48,385
[SPEAKER_15]: I only see a lot of commercials for that Red Dawn remake.

2596
02:59:49,165 --> 02:59:52,670
[SPEAKER_15]: which apparently, according to the commercial, always got a lot of good reviews.

2597
02:59:53,091 --> 02:59:54,393
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, here's the thing.

2598
02:59:54,854 --> 03:00:01,704
[SPEAKER_15]: There are so many movie critics that'll say good things about any fucking movie just to be in the commercial and gain their own cred.

2599
03:00:02,024 --> 03:00:02,505
[SPEAKER_15]: Believe it.

2600
03:00:04,002 --> 03:00:07,124
[SPEAKER_07]: For the record, I'm sorry, Red Dawn was a movie in the 80s.

2601
03:00:07,144 --> 03:00:07,384
[SPEAKER_07]: It was.

2602
03:00:07,964 --> 03:00:08,444
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all.

2603
03:00:08,644 --> 03:00:10,165
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the only thing I have to say about that.

2604
03:00:10,245 --> 03:00:12,787
[SPEAKER_13]: And they're remaking it because you know it's so topical.

2605
03:00:12,807 --> 03:00:16,569
[SPEAKER_13]: I kind of want to see the sequel or the second one or the remake or whatever you want to call it.

2606
03:00:16,749 --> 03:00:17,749
[SPEAKER_13]: I kind of want to see it.

2607
03:00:17,809 --> 03:00:18,129
[SPEAKER_13]: Really?

2608
03:00:18,169 --> 03:00:19,150
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it looks kind of cool.

2609
03:00:19,610 --> 03:00:19,930
Really?

2610
03:00:20,551 --> 03:00:24,593
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want the scene where the girl's dead and she has the grenade on her and they find her and they blow up.

2611
03:00:25,173 --> 03:00:28,795
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not like, you know, I don't think it's going to be better than the original or anything like that.

2612
03:00:28,815 --> 03:00:30,356
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just going to be, it's just a movie.

2613
03:00:30,496 --> 03:00:30,896
[SPEAKER_13]: Whatever.

2614
03:00:31,256 --> 03:00:32,537
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just a dumb popcorn flick.

2615
03:00:33,095 --> 03:00:33,595
[SPEAKER_13]: Exactly.

2616
03:00:33,795 --> 03:00:35,136
[SPEAKER_13]: It is a dumb popcorn flick.

2617
03:00:36,116 --> 03:00:41,859
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's been a lot of dumb popcorn flicks that have come out, like Dread, that ended up being really good.

2618
03:00:42,579 --> 03:00:44,881
[SPEAKER_16]: Dread was amazingly good.

2619
03:00:45,141 --> 03:00:45,781
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, man.

2620
03:00:46,161 --> 03:00:48,322
[SPEAKER_16]: It's funny to say, that's the last movie that I saw.

2621
03:00:48,462 --> 03:00:49,543
[SPEAKER_16]: I've missed Avengers.

2622
03:00:49,703 --> 03:00:51,244
[SPEAKER_16]: I've missed Prometheus.

2623
03:00:51,644 --> 03:00:53,104
[SPEAKER_16]: I haven't seen Wreck-It Ralph yet.

2624
03:00:53,144 --> 03:00:53,925
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to see Skyfall.

2625
03:00:53,965 --> 03:00:54,985
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to see all of those.

2626
03:00:55,465 --> 03:00:57,106
[SPEAKER_16]: For some reason, I just don't see movies enough.

2627
03:00:57,586 --> 03:01:00,328
[SPEAKER_16]: But when I was out in New Mexico, I saw Dread with some friends of mine.

2628
03:01:00,488 --> 03:01:00,648
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, man.

2629
03:01:00,888 --> 03:01:05,232
[SPEAKER_16]: Man, knew nothing about it going in other than Judge Dredd and completely worth it.

2630
03:01:05,252 --> 03:01:06,334
[SPEAKER_07]: I used to have the pinball table.

2631
03:01:06,354 --> 03:01:08,836
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if I played that one.

2632
03:01:09,136 --> 03:01:09,457
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

2633
03:01:09,477 --> 03:01:09,997
[SPEAKER_15]: It's okay.

2634
03:01:10,117 --> 03:01:12,700
[SPEAKER_15]: If anybody else wants to call, I can squeeze in one other quick call.

2635
03:01:12,720 --> 03:01:15,923
[SPEAKER_15]: 1-877-GAME-OLR or a username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.

2636
03:01:16,464 --> 03:01:17,385
[SPEAKER_15]: Any other last minute stories?

2637
03:01:17,425 --> 03:01:18,946
[SPEAKER_15]: I still have some Twitter topics to do, but...

2638
03:01:19,947 --> 03:01:35,655
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, as we kind of mentioned a little bit, your Nintendo Network account is tied to your Wii U, so if it breaks, I guess you better send it to Nintendo, because I'm sure they can transfer it to a new system, but if you try to go buy a new system, you're fucked.

2639
03:01:36,275 --> 03:01:37,196
[SPEAKER_13]: So, just saying.

2640
03:01:38,436 --> 03:01:41,818
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm giving Nintendo the benefit of the doubt here that they just haven't implemented that yet.

2641
03:01:42,179 --> 03:01:42,519
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope.

2642
03:01:42,699 --> 03:01:43,059
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope.

2643
03:01:43,199 --> 03:01:53,285
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm thinking that it's something that a consumer can't just go buy a new system that they have to send it in Nintendo for a repair and then they can do the transfer because that's how it was with the Wii.

2644
03:01:53,465 --> 03:01:58,768
[SPEAKER_13]: How do you get all your Wii or Wii virtual console crap transferred over that they would have to do it.

2645
03:01:59,268 --> 03:02:22,522
[SPEAKER_13]: and then of course somebody accidentally found a way to get into the dev stuff or the debug menu for the Wii U thing and then there was another one that someone put that somehow they got into the debug thing for the Wii U Miiverse but I think that's photoshopped so I'm not going to say anything about that but yeah the debug menu though on the actual system I can believe that

2646
03:02:23,817 --> 03:02:24,137
[SPEAKER_15]: TigerClaw.com

2647
03:02:43,257 --> 03:02:51,603
[SPEAKER_15]: The Human Rights Campaign, which champions a lot of LGBT causes, which, you know, obviously huge, huge month for them with the elections.

2648
03:02:52,563 --> 03:02:58,407
[SPEAKER_15]: Microsoft and EA were recognized as best places to work for LGBT equality.

2649
03:02:58,849 --> 03:03:07,439
[SPEAKER_15]: And I love that the picture on this article is Kaiden and Man Shepard from Mass Effect 3, which is a great example from EA's universe.

2650
03:03:09,481 --> 03:03:11,704
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm telling you, I don't care how it makes me sound.

2651
03:03:12,124 --> 03:03:14,127
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the reason I played Mass Effect.

2652
03:03:14,187 --> 03:03:16,009
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, alright, I do need to play Mass Effect.

2653
03:03:16,049 --> 03:03:17,550
[SPEAKER_15]: I gotta see what this is all about.

2654
03:03:18,472 --> 03:03:19,413
[SPEAKER_15]: I was not disappointed.

2655
03:03:19,873 --> 03:03:21,195
[SPEAKER_15]: But there's something in it for everybody.

2656
03:03:23,577 --> 03:03:25,800
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know Microsoft has always got kudos to this.

2657
03:03:26,080 --> 03:03:29,864
[SPEAKER_15]: I saw there was like an official Microsoft gamer con video that they did.

2658
03:03:29,924 --> 03:03:32,787
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know they've always been pretty good too with this stuff.

2659
03:03:33,208 --> 03:03:33,828
[SPEAKER_15]: So good for them.

2660
03:03:34,849 --> 03:03:39,555
[SPEAKER_15]: The 2013 Corporate Equality Index is the national benchmarking tool on corporate policies.

2661
03:03:39,895 --> 03:03:41,597
[SPEAKER_15]: This is according to the official website.

2662
03:03:42,237 --> 03:03:46,479
[SPEAKER_15]: and EA's Chief Talent Officer, Gabrielle Toledano.

2663
03:03:46,919 --> 03:03:55,083
[SPEAKER_15]: I am very pleased that EA has scored 100% rating and has been recognized by the Human Rights Campaign in a year where the company has taken significant steps to remain inclusive.

2664
03:03:55,543 --> 03:04:02,706
[SPEAKER_15]: EA has made changes to our medical benefits, been involved in LGBT events in our community and taken a public stance against the Defense of Marriage Act.

2665
03:04:03,166 --> 03:04:07,728
[SPEAKER_15]: EA champions diversity with a work environment where everyone feels welcome and can be themselves.

2666
03:04:08,288 --> 03:04:18,070
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I sometimes forget that like I have Alan on my medical insurance because, you know, we've been together long enough that it's basically whether we're legally recognized or not.

2667
03:04:18,110 --> 03:04:19,851
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like a common law partnership at this thing.

2668
03:04:20,231 --> 03:04:21,311
[SPEAKER_15]: I can put him on my benefits.

2669
03:04:21,371 --> 03:04:21,891
[SPEAKER_15]: No problem.

2670
03:04:21,911 --> 03:04:25,552
[SPEAKER_15]: Because, you know, I'm in California and I work for a health insurance company that recognize that stuff.

2671
03:04:25,952 --> 03:04:28,392
[SPEAKER_15]: I sometimes forget like not everybody's that lucky.

2672
03:04:29,153 --> 03:04:30,693
[SPEAKER_15]: He just blows my mind.

2673
03:04:32,635 --> 03:04:45,835
[SPEAKER_13]: I had one more last minute story please it's kind of cool it's a Black Ops 2 easter egg in the Nuketown 2025 map if you shoot off all the mannequins heads on that map in under 60 seconds it unlocks an Atari 2600

2674
03:04:47,937 --> 03:05:01,310
[SPEAKER_13]: on the TV in the game, the Nuketown TV, the big old screen TV, and you can play Activision games, including Hero, Pitfall, and Kaboom were some of the ones I did see screenshots for.

2675
03:05:01,530 --> 03:05:01,810
[SPEAKER_13]: Nice.

2676
03:05:02,871 --> 03:05:03,532
[SPEAKER_13]: Or video on.

2677
03:05:04,482 --> 03:05:19,629
[SPEAKER_15]: a couple questions and comments on Twitter from Osfer on Twitter not sold on the Wii U wait until some relevant games come out I think you're in camp Loki over there I think Loki will be swayed if the right games come out but we ain't there yet Bayonetta 2

2678
03:05:21,635 --> 03:05:22,776
[SPEAKER_15]: Ways off still.

2679
03:05:22,956 --> 03:05:29,181
[SPEAKER_15]: But I bet there's going to be that Zelda or that big game is going to be a must-have next year.

2680
03:05:29,281 --> 03:05:29,681
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll see.

2681
03:05:30,061 --> 03:05:30,421
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll see.

2682
03:05:31,943 --> 03:05:32,743
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not disappointed.

2683
03:05:34,064 --> 03:05:35,745
[SPEAKER_15]: Spazinator PSN tweets us.

2684
03:05:36,686 --> 03:05:37,386
[SPEAKER_15]: Random question.

2685
03:05:37,807 --> 03:05:41,669
[SPEAKER_15]: If you three could only pick one to play, which would you pick?

2686
03:05:42,330 --> 03:05:45,412
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to say you four because he didn't know maybe that Jason was going to be here tonight.

2687
03:05:45,732 --> 03:05:46,553
[SPEAKER_15]: Which would you pick?

2688
03:05:46,933 --> 03:05:49,735
[SPEAKER_15]: PC gaming or console games?

2689
03:05:50,215 --> 03:05:50,675
[SPEAKER_15]: and why?

2690
03:05:51,375 --> 03:05:54,156
[SPEAKER_15]: So you only get one or the other ever again.

2691
03:05:54,476 --> 03:05:56,376
[SPEAKER_15]: PC gaming or console and why?

2692
03:05:56,616 --> 03:05:56,996
[SPEAKER_07]: PC.

2693
03:05:57,576 --> 03:05:57,756
[SPEAKER_15]: Why?

2694
03:05:57,816 --> 03:06:00,077
[SPEAKER_07]: Practically everything that I want to play on the console is on the PC.

2695
03:06:01,257 --> 03:06:04,958
[SPEAKER_07]: I can hook up a controller to the PC and play it as it was a console game.

2696
03:06:05,318 --> 03:06:09,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus I've got a whole bunch of other games that were made specifically for PC so it really expands my repertoire.

2697
03:06:10,278 --> 03:06:19,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus I have emulators for classic games so technically I could also play console games on my PC with the right emulator.

2698
03:06:20,529 --> 03:06:21,469
[SPEAKER_15]: DC Universe Jason

2699
03:06:48,396 --> 03:06:57,329
[SPEAKER_16]: Console gaming, because if there were a computer, I have completely admittedly the library of games I want to play would not be on the platform.

2700
03:06:58,411 --> 03:07:02,116
[SPEAKER_16]: Because I'm sure people who care will understand that.

2701
03:07:02,800 --> 03:07:20,880
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I'm gonna go with PC as well, and I think, uh, for most of the same reasons as Jamie, I, it's not, it's not that I necessarily prefer PC over console, I mean, they, they have their perks, but there are some games on PC that just are never gonna happen on the console, like Civ, Civ V.

2702
03:07:21,821 --> 03:07:45,790
[SPEAKER_15]: Not gonna happen Typing of the Dead World of Warcraft Hello, that's like the game I play more than anything That's, you know, PC only And I was gonna say the bit about emulators But she took the words out of my mouth Is that most of the classics you can still get on PC Whether, you know, Spazinator would consider that cheating or not I guess it's to be seen But I would say PC gaming So

2703
03:07:46,488 --> 03:07:47,908
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, that's it for Twitter.

2704
03:07:48,108 --> 03:07:51,369
[SPEAKER_15]: How about anything else with last minute stories, Loki?

2705
03:07:52,929 --> 03:07:54,690
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, no, got nothing.

2706
03:07:55,430 --> 03:07:56,810
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, we got one more call coming in.

2707
03:07:56,850 --> 03:08:00,831
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just about to click the button to close it, but we have one more call coming in and sure we'll take it.

2708
03:08:01,151 --> 03:08:02,151
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2709
03:08:02,171 --> 03:08:02,511
[SPEAKER_15]: Who's this?

2710
03:08:03,291 --> 03:08:04,471
[SPEAKER_15]: Wolverines!

2711
03:08:05,372 --> 03:08:05,992
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

2712
03:08:06,432 --> 03:08:07,092
[SPEAKER_15]: It's Sterlok.

2713
03:08:07,272 --> 03:08:08,712
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, Sterlok, what's on your mind, buddy?

2714
03:08:11,073 --> 03:08:12,573
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, yeah, not too much.

2715
03:08:13,073 --> 03:08:13,173
[SPEAKER_11]: Um,

2716
03:08:15,430 --> 03:08:19,172
[SPEAKER_11]: I've been checking out Wii U stuff all day.

2717
03:08:19,232 --> 03:08:22,554
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems pretty cool.

2718
03:08:24,755 --> 03:08:25,035
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know.

2719
03:08:25,155 --> 03:08:35,261
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm liking the whole tablet thing and not needing the TV on if you don't even want to feel like doing that.

2720
03:08:36,584 --> 03:08:36,624
[SPEAKER_15]: Um...

2721
03:09:03,530 --> 03:09:07,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, first of all, good games that I care about.

2722
03:09:07,573 --> 03:09:10,755
[SPEAKER_11]: And really, as it stands right now, I don't think there's a whole lot.

2723
03:09:12,196 --> 03:09:17,240
[SPEAKER_11]: Just like how the Vita kind of was.

2724
03:09:17,961 --> 03:09:24,265
[SPEAKER_11]: It didn't really have much starting, and it's slowly getting more and more games that I care about.

2725
03:09:26,627 --> 03:09:31,771
[SPEAKER_11]: What I like is, I guess the tablet actually does have a headphone jack in it.

2726
03:09:33,109 --> 03:09:42,947
[SPEAKER_11]: so that's kind of cool obviously my big thing is being able to use the freaking buttons

2727
03:09:45,186 --> 03:09:45,786
[SPEAKER_11]: for the menus.

2728
03:09:45,926 --> 03:09:48,567
[SPEAKER_15]: I honestly haven't explored that to see if that's a possibility.

2729
03:09:49,767 --> 03:09:52,608
[SPEAKER_11]: I've heard that, yeah, you can for at least most things.

2730
03:09:53,648 --> 03:09:54,228
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's good.

2731
03:09:55,369 --> 03:10:07,692
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if you caught my comment earlier in the show, but one of the things I really love about the Wii U is the whole fact that the sound on the TV and the sound coming out of the gamepad will really complement each other.

2732
03:10:08,052 --> 03:10:11,793
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm not just talking about the incidentals like we were used to hearing with the Wii.

2733
03:10:12,193 --> 03:10:13,194
[SPEAKER_15]: I heard with Zombie U, your radio...

2734
03:10:31,225 --> 03:10:38,853
[SPEAKER_11]: Transmissions, like the stuff that you're getting through, you know, your radio actually comes out of the tablet, which is pretty neat.

2735
03:10:39,313 --> 03:10:41,915
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, and Batman Arkham City does something similar.

2736
03:10:42,056 --> 03:10:44,958
[SPEAKER_15]: If you are close to the person, you'll hear it from the TV.

2737
03:10:45,078 --> 03:10:48,021
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're far away, you'll hear it on the tablet as a radio transmission.

2738
03:10:48,041 --> 03:10:49,022
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, that is cool.

2739
03:10:49,162 --> 03:10:49,803
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2740
03:10:50,103 --> 03:10:50,844
[SPEAKER_15]: That's very cool.

2741
03:10:51,465 --> 03:10:53,446
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, what I'm curious about is I wonder, like,

2742
03:10:55,243 --> 03:11:12,499
[SPEAKER_11]: If all of the game audio, like say if you have your TV doing something else and you're just using the controller, I wonder if all of your game audio is going to be streamed as well or if it's just going to be the...

2743
03:11:13,357 --> 03:11:15,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Incidentals, that's what I'm curious about.

2744
03:11:15,218 --> 03:11:16,279
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it depends on the game.

2745
03:11:16,519 --> 03:11:27,447
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I would have to say, if I would have to take an educated guess, Rob was playing Mario, and the gamepad experience versus the TV was identical.

2746
03:11:28,207 --> 03:11:32,571
[SPEAKER_16]: I would assume that when headphones are in there, I didn't really hear anything coming out of the gamepad.

2747
03:11:32,591 --> 03:11:35,793
[SPEAKER_15]: The music was not identical, because they were complementing each other.

2748
03:11:35,953 --> 03:11:41,737
[SPEAKER_15]: But most of the sound effects, you probably couldn't hear it all the way back here, because you're just hearing all the sound from the side of the room.

2749
03:11:41,897 --> 03:11:42,378
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for watching!

2750
03:12:04,421 --> 03:12:12,543
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, I wanted to bring up a word of caution for those that are big fans of Super Smash Bros.

2751
03:12:12,623 --> 03:12:16,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Brawl, particularly with the GameCube controls.

2752
03:12:19,225 --> 03:12:23,346
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't get rid of your Wii, because Wii U doesn't have GameCube ports.

2753
03:12:23,466 --> 03:12:24,726
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, that's a very good point.

2754
03:12:25,626 --> 03:12:31,408
[SPEAKER_11]: And general consensus from many, many people that I've seen is

2755
03:12:33,086 --> 03:12:35,468
[SPEAKER_11]: GameCube controller is kind of the best way to play Brawl.

2756
03:12:35,728 --> 03:12:37,789
[SPEAKER_15]: What about the Pro controller?

2757
03:12:37,809 --> 03:12:39,350
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I guess maybe it wouldn't work.

2758
03:12:39,650 --> 03:12:40,871
[SPEAKER_11]: That wouldn't work with Brawl, though.

2759
03:12:41,732 --> 03:12:42,092
[SPEAKER_15]: Yikes.

2760
03:12:43,013 --> 03:12:43,333
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

2761
03:12:44,254 --> 03:12:46,715
[SPEAKER_15]: They need to bring back the Wave Bird.

2762
03:12:47,736 --> 03:12:48,216
[SPEAKER_11]: No shit.

2763
03:12:48,236 --> 03:12:51,138
[SPEAKER_11]: The only thing the Wave Bird was missing was Rumble.

2764
03:12:51,899 --> 03:12:53,920
[SPEAKER_11]: That would have made it perfect.

2765
03:12:54,120 --> 03:12:54,580
[SPEAKER_11]: That's true.

2766
03:12:55,181 --> 03:12:59,584
[SPEAKER_11]: But that is probably one of my favorite controllers still.

2767
03:13:00,327 --> 03:13:28,046
[SPEAKER_11]: it was a good controller just nice and sturdy and just I have my collection of wave birds I do actually have four wave birds one of them is an E3 wave bird that my friend sold me alright well Sterlok I gotta let you go so we can wrap up but any other comments before we let you go um it has nothing to do with games but um swear to god

2768
03:13:30,259 --> 03:13:38,443
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if it's still there, but there was a single box of Twinkies on eBay with a buy it now of $10,000.

2769
03:13:40,144 --> 03:13:40,924
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not kidding.

2770
03:13:41,504 --> 03:13:42,445
[SPEAKER_07]: Fucking ridiculous.

2771
03:13:43,245 --> 03:13:43,686
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, right?

2772
03:13:44,206 --> 03:13:46,667
[SPEAKER_15]: And I hope they're gold-plated Twinkies.

2773
03:13:46,687 --> 03:13:49,769
[SPEAKER_11]: You know all that shit's going to be bought out and don't...

2774
03:13:50,858 --> 03:13:51,939
[SPEAKER_11]: Bimbo will do it.

2775
03:13:52,259 --> 03:13:52,960
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll be fine.

2776
03:13:53,000 --> 03:13:54,902
[SPEAKER_15]: Twinkies aren't even that good anyway.

2777
03:13:54,982 --> 03:13:55,722
[SPEAKER_15]: I am telling you.

2778
03:13:56,023 --> 03:13:57,164
[SPEAKER_15]: Shit, my thing is Ding Dongs.

2779
03:13:57,304 --> 03:13:59,986
[SPEAKER_15]: Little Debbie Strawberry Shortcakes are the bomb.

2780
03:14:00,046 --> 03:14:00,586
[SPEAKER_15]: Nutty Bars.

2781
03:14:01,007 --> 03:14:05,551
[SPEAKER_07]: But remember, we have two Weird Al references with Hostess products.

2782
03:14:05,611 --> 03:14:05,991
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?

2783
03:14:06,131 --> 03:14:08,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Ding Dong Man, Ding Dong, Ding Dong Yo.

2784
03:14:09,134 --> 03:14:13,037
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Twinkie Wiener Sandwich.

2785
03:14:14,093 --> 03:14:14,473
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

2786
03:14:15,013 --> 03:14:18,694
[SPEAKER_15]: The only Twinkie that I accept is a deep-fried Twinkie.

2787
03:14:19,034 --> 03:14:22,835
[SPEAKER_07]: I only could eat half of one when we did those at the tourney.

2788
03:14:23,055 --> 03:14:34,257
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know, that just sounds like... A part of DDR's history in Sacramento has died because we had the only DDR tournament ever to sell deep-fried Twinkies.

2789
03:14:35,477 --> 03:14:35,857
[SPEAKER_15]: Why?

2790
03:14:36,697 --> 03:14:37,797
[SPEAKER_15]: Why the fuck not, bitch?

2791
03:14:37,817 --> 03:14:40,398
[SPEAKER_11]: What a distinguishing factor you have there.

2792
03:14:42,079 --> 03:14:44,822
[SPEAKER_15]: Dude, in Sacramento, we did it fucked up.

2793
03:14:44,982 --> 03:14:50,828
[SPEAKER_15]: Because our first tournament was SCAT, Sacramento Cosplay and Tournament.

2794
03:14:53,431 --> 03:14:53,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
