14184	19627	Tonight, November 25, 2012, could a new scaled-down Xbox 360 be on the way?
19987	24950	Sony's credit rating is reduced, and Japan bans the sale of a controversial cartridge.
31707	36791	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
36851	43936	It is Orange Lounge Radio live with this episode number 483 for November the 25th of 2012.
44997	52963	My name is Rob Roberts and I'm here to talk to you guys about video games and what's going on in gaming culture and so forth with my co-host.
53343	56626	Say hello first off to the one, the only, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
56846	58267	You should really watch where that glass is.
58987	60348	Oh, with the mic cords and everything?
61649	64731	I didn't want to knock it off and then onto your knee and have you curse loudly.
64771	67052	Although that might have been funny, but it would have been very poor radio.
67112	67352	Yes.
67832	69253	Broken glass going into my foot.
69413	70654	Not a good radio time.
70994	72475	No, but it would have been hilarious here.
72855	73155	All right.
73195	73536	Not really.
74136	75096	Heart, heart, heart, heart.
75277	77778	Also say hello less, or what is it?
77898	79679	Less than slash three.
79819	80039	Okay.
81520	83601	Also say hello to Techmaster Loki.
83761	84021	Hi.
84262	84882	How are you, Loki?
85102	85342	Good.
85822	86182	All right.
86343	86963	What's new with you?
88163	88544	Not much.
88564	89344	Did you have a good holiday?
89644	90485	Yeah, it was fun.
90585	91025	Eat a lot?
91565	91765	Yes.
92085	92326	Good.
92426	92946	Good times.
93026	96528	I read about the adventures of your child sitting under the tree eating spaghetti.
98088	99029	A spaghetti Thanksgiving?
99528	100529	Nelly posted something.
100569	101730	How does that work?
101790	103793	Or eating some food under the tree.
103853	104393	Maybe turkey?
104533	105735	All right.
105835	109679	Anyhow, also say hello to the ever-present fourth guest in our chat room.
110500	118368	Live.VogNetwork.com is the place to be where you can read comments such as Jason, who says, Rob sounds particularly more energetic tonight.
118908	121131	And Brad from PodCulture says, probably lots of coffee.
121511	122051	That's true.
122231	123552	Yes, four cups today.
123792	124752	That's true.
124832	125252	Woo-hoo.
125552	127432	All right, we do have another guest joining us in studio.
127973	129013	Somebody new to the show.
129293	132994	Can you believe there's still people in Sacramento who play video games who haven't been on this show?
133954	135534	But we do have somebody new to the show tonight.
135554	137455	I don't know if you have a nickname you'd like to go by.
137475	139055	What do you want me to introduce you as tonight?
140195	142196	WordPress handle is Rakshasarani.
142956	144957	Rock Shas, are you a Kingdom Hearts girl?
145177	146377	Is that where Rock Shas comes from?
146517	148618	No, no, it's Rock Shasa Rani.
148658	152479	It basically translates to Ogre Queen, but I'm sure it's improperly conjugated.
152659	153779	Okay, that's all right.
154059	155420	Well, hello and welcome to the show.
155520	156960	Don't expect me to be able to repeat that.
156980	157921	Can I call you by your first name?
158101	158881	Yes, go right ahead.
158901	160481	I'm going to call you Rachel because that's what your name is.
161102	161802	So hi, Rachel.
161842	162542	Welcome to the show.
163222	164043	Not Indian at all.
164223	166265	But we could go Rachel.
167366	170548	A good plug for your WordPress right at the top of the show.
171609	174011	That's the way to sell your site here on Orange Lounge Radio.
174592	176653	So, welcome to the show.
176753	179215	You and Jamie go to school together or something like that, right?
179255	180697	We slave away on the magazine together.
180877	181998	Okay, good times.
182038	185901	Yeah, and we're both kind of subbing on the other side pretty much.
186421	192186	You know, I always felt more part of the writing process, but this year I'm on the design team, whereas...
192526	195549	Jamie, who is an excellent designer, is now on the English side of it.
195789	197510	Yeah, so we're sort of crossed over.
198191	203695	But that means we both see what goes on on each side and then go, what's up with that?
205396	208158	So you guys are frenzies from school.
208279	213483	So how did you guys, obviously you guys connected because you're both obviously geeky gals, which is great.
213523	214303	We love geeky gals.
214964	216285	How did you guys kind of find that connection?
217751	236672	through many rides home and series of conversations and yarn which I'm working on during the show again more crochet you were mentioning earlier that you are very experienced with yarn and all that stuff and she's a fantastic potter oh thank you
237032	243498	and that's really my only contribution to the yarn store is because my mother's more of a crocheter, my sister knits.
243978	250164	I do these things called yarn bowls and basically it's just, you know, yarn accessories works out pretty well for me.
250224	255128	Well, all this talk about knitting and crocheting and pottery is going to go over great with our teen male audience, but...
256509	257210	Hi, boys.
259491	261132	I play games and I do pottery.
262212	263513	Let's talk about games for a minute.
263553	264694	Do pottery, not pot.
265774	269357	We were talking a little bit before the show and you mentioned you have a love of Silent Hill.
269777	270857	Oh, yes, yes.
271318	273619	Which is very fond for us here at OLR.
274199	275320	What's your favorite out of the series?
276292	278733	Ooh, it's kind of a toss-up.
280493	282574	I kind of like 3 and 4.
283514	287215	I love 4 for its story more than its gameplay aspects.
287375	287755	Interesting.
287775	289455	You don't hear a lot of people sticking up for 4.
289615	292776	I think 4 was better than people say it was.
292936	293556	It was intriguing.
293616	294817	But weird that you didn't say 2.
296684	297184	I don't know.
297224	297545	Go with that.
297565	298625	What other games do you play?
298705	300046	What other games do you like?
300066	300887	What are you a fan of?
314435	315956	I've been playing a lot of Portal recently.
316897	320179	Well, I love Portal, but it's really on my four-year-old nephew's account, too.
320259	326104	He's a huge fan of Portal, too, and that is literally the first thing out of his mouth any time he comes over to visit.
326865	329888	So I've got that pretty much, like, I could navigate that in my sleep.
330488	331209	Nice, nice.
331249	332690	No wonder you and Jamie get along.
333931	337354	She would not shut up about Portal until she discovered Mass Effect.
338593	340034	So now I've got to get her... Oh, God.
340075	341516	Did she suck you into that, too?
341676	341956	Not yet.
341976	342937	I've been telling her about it.
343117	343838	I've got Becky.
344058	345620	Becky's already beaten the third game now.
347041	347381	Wait a minute.
347962	349143	She's playing through Leviathan now.
349463	351285	Did Becky play a lot of video games before?
351445	351686	No.
352026	352286	None.
354348	357631	I should tell her that we're talking about her because she's actually making dinner for Julian right now.
357811	358172	Oh, okay.
358272	362276	But she's like, I found out that the controllers are ergonomic.
362376	363136	They don't hurt.
363156	363617	What?
364257	366359	So she's been playing through everything on Xbox 360.
366800	367441	I figured it out.
368341	373847	Mass Effect 3, or Mass Effect the series, is like Fifty Shades of Grey, but a different version of it.
374147	375288	It's like Fifty Shades of Garrus.
375308	376289	Fifty Shades of Garrus!
376349	376549	A.K.A.
376609	377210	Turian Peen.
381574	383335	Shade 1, calibrations.
383996	385977	Shade 2, more calibrations.
386818	388299	Shade 3, can you come back later?
388339	389580	I'm trying to do some calibrations.
391801	395504	No, but I'm actually super looking forward to Omega.
396624	397565	You have to play Mass Effect.
397985	398786	The first one's free.
399086	402310	Going to our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com where you can participate.
402870	406374	A supporter, Rachel, in the chatroom, Shayna Linko says, yay, someone else likes 4.
406675	407495	4 was awesome.
408136	409097	4 was pretty cool.
409257	412140	Shayna's a huge Silent Hill fan, so let's see.
412421	415264	And Actdeft, Portal is the most fun, Portal 2 is the best.
417486	418107	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
436390	439132	It's about the whole, you know, Shepard, Garrus.
439332	441274	It's not like first contact with her butt, is it?
442615	444797	No, it's Turian pain.
445077	450662	But anyway, she also did a series of drawings of what she thinks the vag of other species is.
450922	451043	Why?
451083	453024	Why, why, why?
453525	455486	Because inquiring minds want to know.
456607	459350	But the thing is, she's actually a super, super good artist.
461656	473440	and that's what she spends her talents on so her work is actually rather realistic and it would make like logical sense oh my god I can't did someone say portfolio?
475461	489886	anyhow let me bring up another random comment to try and stir this conversation in a different direction I'm going to bring up another game I know you told me about earlier Rachel Brad from PodCulture says ooh Steam has Arkham City for $7.50 that's another game series you said you were into right?
490434	491055	Oh, yes, yes.
491135	499614	As a matter of fact, first time I installed Arkham Asylum, I did one complete playthrough throughout two days because I didn't want to have to, you know...
501348	524418	Yeah I installed it and then I didn't register it or whatever so I couldn't save it so I basically just played the thing for two days straight and then Arkham City came out I played that thing into the ground and like I'm you know I come from a family of completionists so it's like I was in there doing like every single Riddler challenge and oh my god I lost so much sleep it's like I could feel my eyes just ready to fall out of my skull.
524438	525018	But you did it!
525558	526879	Did you do all the DLC too?
527459	529300	No, no, I'm saving those for a special occasion.
529320	530800	Then you haven't really finished it.
531000	531681	I know.
531721	532521	Twitch, Twitch, Twitch.
532541	533801	I was trying to see if I could get her to Twitch.
534282	536002	Were you a fan of the comics before playing the game?
537063	538143	You know, not so much the comics.
538223	542044	I got into the games mainly because of the Cartoon Connection.
542544	543845	Kevin Conroy, awesome.
544375	545495	Ah, okay, the animated series.
545696	546016	Oh, yeah.
546456	550257	And, you know, him and Mark Hamill, they are basically Batman and the Joker for me.
550437	551858	It's all kinds of happies.
552218	554138	There's a lot of people on your team when it comes to that.
554579	557440	So, awesome.
557540	560141	I was mad at the DLC.
560341	560581	Huh.
561441	562521	I didn't play all the DLC.
562681	567123	Well, you know the thing with... Okay, the game's been out forever, so I'm just going to freaking say it.
567563	571144	About Harley... Jump ahead quick if you don't want spoilers.
571164	571665	Jump ahead.
571705	572645	Mute for one minute.
572825	574186	about Harley's pregnancy test.
574846	578248	And then, like, in the DLC, there's, like, 20 bajillion of them that are all negative.
579809	583732	Oh, they're trying to fix that for a possible third game or something, maybe.
583792	588214	Except, like, there was the ending where she's singing a lullaby, so... Whatever.
588655	595579	Or, you know, that would be, like, a defining character moment where she thinks she's pregnant, but she's really gone even crazier, so it's like a...
596139	597440	Joker doll that she's calling her.
597660	599801	I kind of like if it would move in that direction.
601181	601601	Interesting.
602462	607704	She sounds like one of those crazy women, like the type that would draw vaginas of alien races and post them on her Tumblr.
607724	608344	You know what?
608644	610165	I linked the Tumblr in the chat room.
610325	610805	Oh, great.
610885	611306	Thank you.
611386	612466	Thank you so much for that.
612546	614047	I'm sure Loki's pulling it up right now.
614987	617308	All right.
617348	623451	For the record, Rob, despite the comic being fairly graphic, it actually is very...
624431	624952	It's artsy.
625012	625873	It actually tells a story.
627194	627994	We'll leave it at that.
628034	628675	We'll leave it at that.
629055	630056	All right.
630376	633299	I would have to ask you before we move on to our real kickoff topic.
633359	635781	Rachel, what's your gaming platform of choice?
636061	639304	Do you have a particular console you tend to play stuff on or are you more PC gal?
639704	640224	Where do you lean?
640705	641185	Shiznight.
641866	645929	You know, I tend to gravitate towards PC just because I'm big on retro games and I
646629	648090	A lot of emulators available there.
648370	649011	Ah, I see.
649131	655215	Yeah, but if you twist my arm and force me to pick, I'd have to go with a Nintendo console, just out of sheer loyalty.
655906	656807	Okay, you're one of those.
657067	657567	No, I'm just kidding.
657688	658628	Yeah, I'm one of those.
658648	659489	Loki will love you!
659509	664032	I don't want anything wrong with Nintendo consoles.
664933	667475	Just, you know, the Wii U is just not worth the money.
668396	673840	Well, we'll get into plenty more of that in a minute, but I did want to talk about some other kickoff topics here real quick.
674340	679064	Obviously, we hope all you guys here in the States had a happy Thanksgiving holiday.
680165	681946	You know, and around the world, hope you had a good week.
682186	682706	Obviously...
683707	685688	retail madness over the weekend.
685728	688429	I kind of hate that that stuff is starting to eclipse Thanksgiving.
688469	690730	I think a lot of people are growing very frustrated with it.
691150	694012	But it is the time to get some good deals.
694572	697393	And the Steam sale, obviously, is another good place to get deals.
698494	702515	Civ V, which I never shut up about on this show, great deal going on right now.
702655	705757	I was really tempted to get Borderlands 2, which I know is on sale.
706137	710099	I'm curious if you guys picked up any gaming deals over these past few days.
710559	710899	Oh, yes.
711319	711859	What'd you get?
712160	712920	What'd you get, DarkSakura?
713631	735876	I bought They Bleed Pixels and Awesome Knots And then I bought Dragon Age Origins, the Deluxe Edition through Origin Although I wish I had waited and just gotten it through Steam Because Steam was a penny cheaper One whole penny But I hate Origin, I prefer playing through Steam And then I actually just bought Sonic Generations on Steam Because it's eight freaking bucks And it's Sonic Generations
736776	739679	with a really screwed up last level, seriously.
741240	742922	Because Dan and I sat and watched the whole playthrough.
744163	744403	Nice.
745344	747727	Rachel, did you take advantage of any of the gaming deals this weekend?
748067	748547	I did not.
748587	753592	I was actually working through Black Friday, even though it wasn't really Black Friday-ish for our shop.
754753	758756	Yeah, I still saw a bit of ugliness, so I was more preoccupied with the working part of that.
759017	760398	Well, that's fair enough, fair enough.
760438	760858	It happens.
762099	769786	You brave, brave retail people that had to work those front lines on Friday, I don't envy you in the slightest, because people are crazy.
770206	776868	Although, I was telling you guys before the show, I went out on Black Friday at about 8 o'clock at night because we needed stuff from Target.
776908	777629	I needed shampoo.
778069	779910	So we went to Target at 8 o'clock.
779970	780350	It's fine.
780690	784351	If you go out at night on Black Friday and after all the crazies have gone to bed, totally fine.
784371	785091	Just like any other day.
785692	789373	Even went to Fry's and got some upgrades for the studio I'll talk about in a minute.
790733	792134	Loki, did you take advantage of any deals?
792294	796334	I bought nothing because I have no money to buy things with.
796414	797815	That's what happens when you're a parent.
797875	798555	You have no money.
798615	799855	I don't think it's just being a parent.
800295	802556	You're also a homeowner and you just bought a new car.
802856	803616	That's a big one.
804796	805176	I don't know.
805196	809117	I just feel like giving people crap for small reasons.
809397	811618	Congrats on the used car.
811918	812658	New to you car.
813058	840605	it's just um and also the other thing too is like the last steam sale i bought a bunch of games i still haven't played most of them and i haven't played most of the games that i got through my humble bundle so i'm just kind of like you know hey that's cool borderlands 2 is down to like 30 bucks whatever am i really gonna play it probably not so it's just you know kind of answering the question is this really something i'm going to play and a lot of times it's no i'm probably not going to play that so that's why i haven't really been buying anything
841889	843809	I didn't really buy anything either.
844310	847710	I did buy another Wii U game when I was at Fry's picking up the new router.
847850	855292	I got Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed for the Wii U just because some of my other friends had it and was giving it positive reviews.
856012	860173	It's only a deal because it's one of the two non-$60 games, I think.
860733	860973	I think 50.
861634	862814	It's 40, actually.
863434	865274	So I think I paid 40 for it.
865314	866635	Maybe I did get a deal and didn't realize it.
866655	867495	Yeah, I think I only paid 40 for it.
867955	871856	And I might have been a deal then because I think that was supposed to be like a $50 game.
871876	872717	Then I did get a deal!
874197	875698	Yeah, I only paid $44 and I'm pretty sure.
875758	876898	So that's pretty cool.
877898	880939	And there was one other game that was cheaper than the others.
880999	881760	I don't remember what it was.
883240	885961	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
906270	910734	and I actually touched some WoW so you guys wouldn't kick me out of the guild.
912015	928387	Going back to Mass Effect in a minute I mean obviously you've talked tons about it on the show but I found the modding you were doing this week interesting because you were posting to our little rabid fan community we have on Facebook and you had like these different colored skinned shepherds like you went in and had like a green skinned shepherd and this weird stuff.
928407	933211	Okay I'll tell you where this came about is because and this is actually me using a little bit
933271	935933	I'm working on making a somewhat Middle Eastern looking shepherd.
952723	966695	And I've tweaked the eyes, I've tweaked the nose, and now I'm tweaking the skin tone, but it's either coming out like too much of a muted chocolate, you know, like the plain milk chocolate with no extra skin tone to it, nothing blushing, nothing under that.
967396	971059	And so I'm playing with blushes, I'm playing with all this, and then I had an idea.
971079	977705	I was like, well, if all of this is showing through whatever the skin is, can I make a Blue Shepard?
978385	979027	Blue Shepard
987054	987474	It worked.
987514	988735	So then I did Red Shepard.
989135	990315	Then I did Green Shepard.
990435	993316	Then I did Yellow Shepard, which looks more like Puke Green Shepard.
993516	996878	But I could get it to work because I've gotten purple hair.
997858	998538	The hair works.
998658	1003320	Congratulations for now fusing the fan communities of Avatar and Mass Effect.
1004500	1006781	There already were blue people in Mass Effect, though.
1006861	1007701	It doesn't matter.
1007741	1008982	You don't need more blue people.
1010757	1011778	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1035301	1039303	and I've modified my coalesced INI to add extra outfits.
1039343	1041004	There is a naked skin for female Shepard.
1043105	1044565	However, she has no real butt crack.
1046046	1047947	There's a naked one for the guys but I can't find it.
1047967	1050108	What is it with the girls and the nudity tonight?
1051068	1051649	It's no problem.
1051669	1054853	You can fix that butt crack problem by just editing the texture.
1054893	1056615	There actually is an edited texture.
1056635	1057556	Buy her bigger panties.
1057576	1059599	That's how you fix the butt crack problem.
1059879	1064504	It's like there's no bits to show and no coloration in certain places.
1064985	1069631	And someone has made, by the way, I found that ages ago, but I didn't know that it actually was based off of real texture.
1070271	1072171	and you can unlock the texture and it's like, okay, whatever.
1072191	1072912	And who'd have thunk it?
1072972	1074872	It's the person that draws the vaginas for you.
1074892	1076532	No, it's not the same person.
1077433	1078593	It's not the same person.
1079793	1085914	But there's actually, did you know that there are two different fabric textures for the underwear?
1086875	1087835	There's shiny and matte.
1088155	1091536	I just learned something that I never thought I'd ever know in my life.
1091796	1094936	But I've had my shepherd running around in an all black uniform.
1095356	1098497	You know, it's actually black and a lighter black for the camo.
1099484	1115019	I have seen some hilarious gifs on Tumblr of I guess there's a way to hack it so that you can play male Shepard in his underwear through the whole game and there's some hilarious gifs of male Shepard jumping out of a starship and he's in his underwear.
1115039	1116240	It looks really funny.
1116500	1126169	No, you can actually, in the Coalesce Dye and Eye, because basically all you do, you can add lines to have it pull different textures for different outfits.
1126429	1130353	So you can actually wear armor in casual look and wear casual clothes into armor.
1130653	1134917	There's also a way to use Ashley's clothes, but I went and looked through the actual meshes.
1135878	1150963	The reason why there's a big problem with people using Ashley's face is first of all it's fully colored so if you have it over a colored face already it's going to show up orange and part of her chest is rendered so you'd actually get Shepard with a hole in her chest if you try to use Ashley's clothes with no boobs pretty much.
1151423	1152424	Oh boy, alright.
1152504	1154346	Yeah, this is what I spent all week doing.
1154486	1157029	You're gonna need your own podcast about Mass Effect at some point.
1157129	1157509	Just wait.
1157749	1158790	Alright, moving on.
1159011	1159731	But I did play another game.
1159911	1160272	Oh, what else?
1160712	1166238	Dragon Age Origins, and I made a Dalish, which I sometimes want to call a Danish.
1166698	1171503	She's a redhead, kind of cool, and I don't know that I like the game so much yet, but I'm gonna give it a try.
1171863	1177993	You know, it might be one of those games that, you know, I didn't really love it the first time I played it, but I went back later and I liked it a little more.
1178193	1180677	Like, it's just kind of, sometimes games don't really hit you the first time.
1181217	1182880	I'm just really not a big fan of the combat in it.
1183381	1186425	But I might go back and see about getting Dragon Age 2.
1188445	1215781	which I started playing on Xbox 360 and got pretty far in until that stupid battle where Fenris is like I'm gonna be emo and kill you now see that's really weird because most of the fandom really doesn't like Dragon Age 2 but it plays like Mass Effect I mean really I like the way it plays that's why I could get into Mass Effect so easily because it handled the same way well you know there's a third one coming out maybe it'll be somewhere in the middle and I played very solitaire
1216201	1216501	Game Sucks
1237930	1240131	I just learned something there you go the more you know
1256177	1260780	I find something new in every single replay.
1260800	1263001	There's always one more secret door I haven't gone through.
1263121	1264842	There's one more connection to Half-Life.
1266143	1271687	The way they paint their characters, everything's pretty three-dimensional, so I appreciate it on a couple different levels.
1271707	1273268	You should talk to Alan about Half-Life at some point.
1273288	1274649	Are you a big Half-Life fan as well?
1275029	1275869	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1301122	1302443	Modern Warfare 3 Modern Warfare 3
1317692	1332820	and also some other stuff because the website I had set up had went down because the free URL forwarding company, co.cc, went under and all the like 5 million domains that they had are poof, gone.
1333220	1334941	So I actually got a legit domain now.
1335021	1341004	So it's now at vog-minecraft.com and there's not really anything there other than the map right now.
1341204	1343325	But eventually there'll be something there.
1343965	1347127	So I put that in our chat room, vog-minecraft.com
1347683	1350684	and there's also a Twitter account to go along with that.
1351485	1353705	VOG Minecraft at Twitter.
1353866	1354406	Look at you.
1355366	1358367	That's great.
1358387	1364690	I've been kind of busy with stuff this week and then hopefully I'll get working on the website soon.
1364930	1370032	I don't really know what I want to do with it but I've got it for a while so we'll play around with that.
1370472	1371533	What else did I do this week?
1372473	1373493	I don't think I played anything else.
1373753	1374314	No, that was it.
1374394	1375034	That was all I played.
1376899	1383783	I actually had a lot of time to play some games thanks to the holiday break and I didn't have too much going on outside of Thanksgiving Day itself.
1385204	1389867	Obviously I've been able to spend more time with the Wii U because on the last show it was launch day.
1390267	1392028	I'd only really spent like an hour with it.
1392108	1399433	So now I've been able to spend some quality time with the Wii U and I've played three different games on the Wii U and two of them are the ones that everybody's been playing.
1399453	1401014	I'll talk first about Nintendo Land.
1401814	1429220	Nintendo Land is a collection of minigames basically I think it's framed a lot better than Wii Sports was I think Monita though as a character will get a little bit irritating to some people but she serves her purpose especially for trying to get those that are not as familiar with how to play a video game acquainted with the games there are some pretty neat games in there I think I like the minigames in it more than I like Wii Sports because let's be real at the end of the day
1430100	1431841	WeTennis was about flailing.
1431961	1433282	There wasn't a lot of skill to it.
1433542	1434783	There wasn't a lot that went into it.
1434863	1437864	It was like imagination with the help of this controller.
1438304	1440586	WeBowling was slightly a little better.
1440646	1445188	You felt like you were a little more in control of your actions, but it was kind of eh at the end of the day as well.
1445228	1449610	I mean, Wii Sports, when all is said and done, I know not everybody's going to agree with this comment.
1449710	1452692	I understand why it ends up on the top 100 gaming list and all that.
1452732	1454133	It was a very influential game.
1454473	1456334	I don't think Wii Sports is actually a really good game.
1457054	1459658	I like Nintendo Land because as a gamer, I feel like there's more game in it.
1472496	1474537	There's more to actually achieve.
1475898	1478019	The Metroid Blast was fun.
1478099	1483542	The F-Zero race, it's certainly not F-Zero, but it's simple enough.
1483702	1487204	Kind of like Atari 2600 basic, but all of these modern graphics.
1487284	1488125	It's fun.
1489425	1498230	The Donkey Kong course is surprisingly like... It's like one of those Mega Man hard games, and all it is is tilting.
1498570	1500291	But it's surprisingly quite a bit of fun.
1500972	1501032	Um...
1502092	1520929	and you know some of the some of the different minigames especially in a party environment the party games the Mario Chase, Animal Crossing, Luigi's Mansion all hilarious we played those on Thanksgiving Day and they were all just a ton of fun especially I think Mario Chase was my personal favorite out of the bunch though Luigi's Mansion is really good as well and Animal Crossing is its own thing
1521529	1528191	Um, but I mean, at its core, those three games are all kind of chase games.
1528331	1531012	They're just like a different twist on the chase element.
1531572	1537493	Like in Luigi's Mansion, you're hidden and you're trying to grab the others before they grab you.
1537914	1540094	In Mario Chase, they're just trying to grab you.
1540534	1544455	In Animal Crossing, you control two people and there's the whole eating the pellets.
1544495	1546736	I mean, I guess it's a little more, uh, different.
1547696	1552520	TigerClaw brings up in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com What about that Pachinko in Nintendo Land?
1552540	1553321	The Pachinko game.
1553401	1555642	I call it Plinko, but yeah, it's pretty much the same thing.
1556163	1557724	Because, you know, they're pretty much the same thing.
1557824	1558304	Paplinko?
1558945	1559465	No, Plinko.
1559866	1561026	I know, but I was saying Paplinko.
1561447	1561907	Paplinko?
1562007	1563168	Instead of Pachinko, Paplinko.
1563328	1563768	Paplinko?
1563969	1564769	Yeah, okay, that works.
1565110	1569453	But there's a Paplinko game you play to get the unlocks, but eh, I could give or take it.
1569493	1570794	The unlock is a little bit silly.
1571474	1571554	Um...
1572575	1575536	But as a pack-in game overall, it's fine.
1576196	1581838	I would see myself revisiting this game far more than I would revisit Wii Sports.
1583679	1587000	Mario U, Super Mario Wii U, is great.
1587500	1588561	It's HD Mario.
1589041	1590041	It's what you'd expect.
1590361	1599565	What I love about it is that it's not just a game with the depth of Super Mario World, but it has all these little extra modes as well to kind of enhance it, like the...
1600445	1602026	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1618897	1623120	The difficulty level of the game ramps up surprisingly quick, and there's some really hard stuff.
1623380	1625361	I had to use an FAQ to get past one of the levels.
1625701	1627683	I couldn't find the stinking door out of the ghost house.
1628003	1631005	And then come to find out, there's like a second one I probably would have never have found.
1631405	1642432	So I'm liking Mario Wii U as a really solid Mario game, even more than I think the one that was previously out on Wii, Wii Regular.
1642712	1645634	And I don't know if that's just because the huge step up in the graphics or what.
1646354	1647194	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1666602	1669244	All the screen does is mirror what's on your TV.
1670064	1675868	If you want to do the whole, I play something on my Wii U while you watch something on TV, that's great.
1676328	1679650	If you have control of your TV, it doesn't really add a lot to the experience.
1679790	1684213	Luckily, it's a gorgeous game to look at, even with all the little touches in the background.
1684233	1686595	They have little dancing Miis that show up in the background and stuff.
1686615	1688196	Just all these little touches that are really cool.
1688796	1692601	and the sound thing that I really hyped up last week is great.
1694022	1699108	The surround sound it kind of creates between the pad and the regular stereo is pretty cool.
1699729	1706076	So yeah, Mario's solid and I'm sure most people that will get a Wii U will pick this game up and it makes sense.
1706317	1706757	Absolutely.
1707678	1731541	um one other game I've been playing on the Wii U that was one of the launch titles uh Sonic Racing no Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed which is a game that's actually on the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 as well it's just you know they also have the Wii U version this is the game we've been talking about on the show we kind of been joking about it and having fun with it because it has Danica Patrick very randomly as a character and it's amazing eyeliner
1732141	1743684	and Wreck-It Ralph and all these other Sega characters like Metal Sonic, Beat, one of the taxi cab drivers from Crazy Taxi, supposedly Alex Kidd gets unlocked at some point.
1746445	1749826	I'm really surprised at how much I'm enjoying this game.
1750886	1777390	and I took a look at some of the reviews online and some of the talk in Miiverse and so forth and a lot of people razzing it for being buggy and I will admit there's been some odd collision detection things but nothing that detracted from the experience so much I was like hating the game in fact I found myself most of the time actually really impressed with some of the level design the stages are all huge stages and they will seamlessly go from
1777910	1784153	Go-karting to flying a plane and Danica Patrick's car turns into like an afterburner jet, which is kind of funny.
1784653	1785853	And on the water.
1785893	1788895	And it kind of just seamlessly transitions between all these different phases.
1789475	1790575	And I was liking it.
1791476	1796158	I was showing you girls before the show tonight, I showed you the Skies of Arcadia level.
1796498	1803921	And you saw how you'll do the first lap and then in the second lap, the pirate ships start attacking the town and are blowing up the road and all this stuff.
1803941	1804921	And there's a lot going on.
1804941	1804961	I
1807282	1824091	I was really into it I gotta admit I'm kind of liking this game I think a little more than the online impressions I mean it's it's got not just a regular mode but all these like special little games in it like boost mode and kill the other people first and there's a battle mode you can play it online on the Wii U
1825171	1830616	Apparently the advantage that the Wii U has over the other versions is that the Wii U is up to five players thanks to the second screen.
1831997	1836261	It's not just a copy of the first screen in single player mode unless you want it to be.
1836602	1839104	If you swipe the screen, you get a copy of the TV.
1839464	1841726	But if you don't, you get a rear view mirror and a map.
1842147	1844529	You know, kind of what you'd expect in your racing game on the second screen.
1844969	1848012	So yeah, I was really surprised.
1848252	1849393	I was kind of like playing it going...
1850174	1860048	You know, Sega did help with that F-Zero game that was on the GameCube and I gotta say, this feels like kind of the closest thing I'm gonna get to an F-Zero game for a little while.
1860669	1863112	Unless maybe they're gonna work on it, which I really hope they do.
1863513	1863973	Sugar Rush.
1864033	1865936	Or yeah, or just flat out do a Sugar Rush game.
1865956	1866297	Sugar Rush!
1867805	1876574	It's weird because the Wreck-It Ralph thing, like, I don't... I mean, it's cool that Wreck-It Ralph and Danica Patrick are in there, I guess, but there's not really a lot else.
1876674	1880659	Like, you don't have the sugar rest stage, or at least I haven't got it yet, or any of that.
1880739	1882480	So it's interesting.
1883361	1893244	Going to some of the comments from our chatters at live.vognetwork.com, Tigerclaw says, the new Sonic racing game is a lot of fun, but boy, it gets pretty hard when doing the medium difficulty on many of the races in difficulty.
1893644	1895864	I can't get past the drift challenges on medium.
1896245	1901226	Yeah, I can do some of it on medium, but like the boost challenge, I couldn't even do that on...
1901946	1916869	regular and here's a little tip for anybody struggling with the game if you flop on a stage four times it'll let you just skip it on the map so you know but you'll still need stars you'll have to compensate the stars from somewhere else in order to be able to get the unlock so I don't know
1917890	1921111	Tiger Claw suggests that maybe some of the Wreck-It-Ralph stuff will be DLC.
1921591	1923572	Well, I don't know how the Wii U is going to handle that.
1924052	1929313	And I will say that part of it kind of concerns me that the Wii U doesn't seem to have a DLC system in place.
1929814	1937216	It's the reason I haven't picked up Mass Effect 3 is I hear that none of the multiplayer enhancements they've done since launch are available.
1937616	1939336	And I'm like, well, then what's the frigging point?
1939696	1945798	Like part of the reason the Mass Effect 3 multiplayer is so amazing is because of all the constant DLC they've been putting out.
1946158	1950100	and I understand that some of the single player DLC is included but they're not going to get Omega.
1950300	1950560	Why?
1950580	1952241	Because Nintendo can't do DLC yet.
1953502	1956683	Or if they can, they're not doing it a lot or something.
1956723	1957063	I don't know.
1957103	1957964	So that part of it...
1959048	1985689	with all the positive I'm saying about the Wii U and overall I am satisfied with my purchase I would be in love with my purchase if some of these other things were corrected but I don't know Nintendo has over the past week been building a lot into the system we got over the past week we got the Netflix the Amazon the YouTube the Hulu and all that showed up like you know just day after day after day and I gotta say the YouTube app in particular
1986329	1990350	Very different look from the other, the PS3 and the Xbox Ones.
1990390	1990710	It's not bad.
1990730	1992110	Bobby said he didn't care for it, right?
1992290	1992470	Huh?
1992610	1993811	Bobby said he didn't care for it, right?
1994231	2002652	I don't remember what he said about YouTube, but the look of it is weird because it doesn't really have any Nintendo branding and it doesn't really have Microsoft.
2003212	2007553	It's kind of different and it works pretty well, especially if you're logged in.
2008674	2014935	I enjoyed it more than the Xbox version of it, even though it functions similarly to
2015575	2017197	But it still felt easier to use.
2017257	2018898	And maybe part of that is having the touchpad.
2018938	2019339	I don't know.
2019899	2020280	But yeah.
2021414	2022514	I don't know.
2022855	2025476	TigerClaw on chat says, Nintendo is just taking baby steps.
2025516	2027676	This is a whole new thing for them, the online community.
2028136	2031718	Well, yes, but at some point you have to stop letting that be an excuse.
2032298	2038360	And I think a lot of us have said, oh, Nintendo, you're just new to the party and so we forgive you.
2038400	2041561	And it's kind of like, okay, that's true, but it's not an excuse.
2042162	2045923	Like, playing catch-up, you know, you've had a lot of time to play catch-up.
2046403	2049624	You know, you should have thought about some of this during the Wii being out there.
2050165	2050445	But,
2051445	2057087	There's some parts about the Wii U like Miiverse is surprisingly interesting.
2057347	2060168	Like it's actually something I keep going back to and looking at.
2060788	2064810	I like looking at the activity feed of my friends and what they've been posting in the games.
2065210	2069892	The first party games really urge you to make public posts in Miiverse to interact with.
2070472	2072953	And I find like I want to see what my friends are posting.
2073293	2075714	And the artwork people are doing is amazing.
2076474	2089599	And I don't know if you guys know this, but in the Wii U, when you turn it on, if you have your Wii U always connected to the internet, it downloads artwork from around the community, like things that have been popular or voted.
2089919	2095821	So when you turn on your Wii, you'll see a helping of random games, and then you'll see some of the popular comments.
2095921	2100022	And they're all these artwork that is really well done and funny.
2100543	2100883	And so...
2102003	2129501	I find it really neat and I don't know if this is what Nintendo intended but you gotta hand it to them this is something Microsoft and Sony aren't doing with their online so let's give Nintendo some credit here the first thing you get when you turn on your system is community you don't even get that with Xbox and Sony that's surprising so if there's one thing Nintendo is doing right when it comes to online community is the first thing you see
2131744	2132205	Interesting.
2133727	2133988	Agreed.
2134569	2138815	Now obviously they have some slow steps in other places, but that's one step in the right direction.
2141715	2168708	going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com Ragenator in chat says interesting or just a novelty that you'll forget about in a month or two that's a very good question Ragenator and I think a lot of that depends on how well will the games in the future support it and what else will come what download content is going to come out what's going to keep the people talking what's going to keep the people providing those funny pictures and so forth and will they allow you to add cat pics later on
2169420	2173161	Well, apparently, like, people have been doing really random stuff.
2173241	2175502	Like, I was reading something on my Facebook.
2175522	2182084	The Destructoid community took over one of the... I think it was the Rabbids game community with pictures of Willem Dafoe.
2182505	2190287	I don't know what the joke is there, but, like, they were drawing Willem Dafoe and writing... I mean, I don't... Sorry, I don't... I don't have time to read every single website on the internet.
2190587	2193288	But, like, I thought it was funny that they're kind of, like, trying to do that.
2193388	2195229	But, you know, so...
2195709	2197970	So yeah, people come up with their own ways to entertain themselves.
2197990	2203152	So it's turning into GameFAQs, basically, where they'll take over a message board.
2204293	2206974	I don't know how well they've succeeded, but yes, possibly.
2207634	2208235	Fantastic.
2209275	2211496	That's what Nintendo needs is more GameFAQs.
2212957	2215359	Bobby in our chatroom wants to clarify some stuff.
2215459	2219243	BlackWolf says, Okay, A, Nintendo has a DLC system in place.
2219623	2220664	New Super Mario Bros.
2220824	2222546	U will have DLC, for instance.
2223066	2225308	Okay, that may be true, but where is it?
2225748	2226769	It's not here at launch.
2227110	2228271	That leads me to think...
2228971	2229993	It's still being built.
2230133	2232756	Remember my Winchester House comparison from last week?
2232997	2234138	I think that's what's happening.
2234459	2238625	I don't have any proof, but at the same time, where is the DLC?
2238645	2239706	It's gonna be there at launch.
2240147	2241609	Remember, they've got six more years.
2242546	2244187	Okay, let's see.
2244447	2248988	And Blackwolf said, B, I think YouTube videos look better in the internet browser than in the app.
2249909	2254370	And you can watch videos on the gamepad from the browser not available in the app.
2254430	2257792	Blackwolf also clarifying, I guess he reads more Destructoid than I do.
2258112	2266275	Blackwolf says, the initial joke was Jim Sterling said, I am remaking the community to be about Willem Dafoe because that's a better use of this community than the game.
2266655	2267235	Okay.
2267915	2269576	The post got moderated away.
2270177	2273358	Did you not see how many people were pissed off at Day 1 DLC?
2273699	2277001	How pissed would you be if there was Day 1 DLC for New Super Mario Bros.
2277161	2277261	U?
2278321	2285225	But Bobby, I am pissed off that there isn't Day 1 DLC for the other games to play catch-up, especially when that DLC is free.
2285686	2293310	So in the case of Mass Effect 3, yes, I do feel like 100% of the game isn't there, especially when you're trying to be competitive with these other consoles.
2293670	2318756	I get that some of the single player DLC but when you're kind of trying to play catch up you know I think that part is missing I get what you're saying about the whole you don't want day one DLC for new Super Mario Brothers Wii U I get that but that's also first party versus third party and you know maybe Nintendo hasn't built it because they don't need it for themselves yet so screw everybody else I don't know anyway
2320219	2325102	All right, I've talked enough about the Wii U. Sorry, guys, but it's with the hot thing that's going on in gaming right now.
2325322	2327944	The other thing I want to talk about in my gaming week, just real quick, I'll throw this out there.
2328624	2331886	Despite the fact that I have a shiny new console, it doesn't mean I'm not going to play other stuff.
2332306	2341652	I've been participating in the Mass Effect 3 weekend challenge like a good player, and I played an epic nine-hour match of Civilization V, start to finish.
2341972	2344233	and I know some people are going only nine hours.
2344593	2351514	Yeah, we did kind of an easier skill level and we agreed the three of us that were playing would not military strike each other but it was a lot of fun.
2351654	2366078	It was my first Gods and Kings game start to finish so I was, you know, thankful I played it and I am still enjoying Civ V and it's on sale right now on Steam and I would support a purchase of that if you wanted to do that.
2367198	2367298	So...
2367978	2368258	All right.
2368999	2371880	Anyhow, that is all I want to say about my gaming week.
2372140	2373041	Housekeeping tonight.
2374381	2382145	Obviously, we always like to plug our Twitter, twitter.com slash OLR, and our Facebook, facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio, and our Google+, search for Orange Lounge Radio.
2383305	2386427	Also, this one's for the live listeners more so than the podcast listeners.
2387147	2390909	I'm hoping so far tonight, live listeners, we haven't had any dropouts on the feed.
2391830	2396632	I know the fact that the stream has been dropping out lately has been very frustrating, but
2397592	2403373	and so we didn't really know if it was us or if it was the host but there's a good chance that it's us here in studio.
2403953	2409694	So what we did on Friday, Alan and I went out and we got a new router for the studio here.
2409774	2417515	So we have like a brand new, it's not like top of the line because I'm sorry, I didn't have 200 bucks to drop on a router but we did get one of those like, what is it, 600?
2417996	2418976	It's like 300 plus 300.
2419916	2421976	It's a huge step up from what we had.
2422236	2426437	Our last router couldn't even do wireless N so we did upgrade that
2426997	2432180	We had this whole thing going on where you actually had two networks in the house and one was daisy-chained to the other.
2432641	2435943	Now it's parent router and bridge.
2436463	2440866	I wrote a post in the VOG Network forums in more detail if you want to see all the parts there.
2441286	2441907	But I think...
2442387	2470970	so far the stream hasn't dropped and the evil protagonist in our chat says sounds great tonight so maybe it was us I didn't want to let that go forever without trying to fix it so fingers crossed now that I've talked about it it's going to drop in the next two minutes just watch but hey that's better than 20 times during the show like last week which was very very frustrating so thank you to our loyal live listeners who have stuck it out throughout all those drops we're trying to make the situation better for you guys I hope it works tonight
2471690	2471950	All right.
2473811	2477353	Yeah, Ragenator brings up, you know, by bringing up the stream dropping, you just jinxed yourself.
2477613	2478393	Well, hey, you know what?
2478413	2481355	We got through 48 minutes without one, which beats last week.
2481455	2484757	So let's just hope.
2485877	2486297	Also...
2487558	2492381	It's a slow news week tonight, you guys, with the holiday going on and everything here in the States.
2492801	2497304	But I will tease the coming up in Part B tonight, Match Game.
2497364	2500686	We haven't done Match Game in at least a year, so we're going to do Match Game tonight.
2500766	2504208	So we will have contestants, one via Skype, one via the chat.
2504248	2510252	So if you want to be potentially our Skype player, make sure you have Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, added on Skype.
2510532	2511553	Again, we're not doing that now.
2511773	2514715	We'll get into it in Part B. I'll let you know when to call.
2515683	2517604	All the symphony of the night you can stand.
2545256	2549298	True, or, you know, if this is going to be like... So much Yaris.
2549698	2551079	If there's going to be... I'm interested in this.
2551599	2558902	If there's going to be like a digital, like a digital Xbox where it's not going to have a disk drive or something like that, it's going to be built into a TV, like as an app.
2559803	2562584	I could see it maybe like, you know, with the games on demand stuff.
2562604	2565005	I was just about to say, couldn't they do games on demand still though?
2565325	2565966	That's possible.
2566226	2569927	All it needs is a USB port and you can suddenly, oh, magical 64 gigs.
2571088	2572609	So they're saying, of course...
2573789	2577471	Anonymous sources are telling them that it's going to be dubbed Xbox TV.
2577671	2581093	It's going to support casual games and run on Windows 8.
2581373	2586355	I think it's just going to be running on the dashboard that's out there that kind of looks like Windows 8.
2587456	2592999	And I guess some sort of chipset is going to allow for quick bootups and that kind of stuff.
2593639	2604712	And they're saying that it's also going to be able to kind of like, I don't know, maybe kind of incorporate surface stuff or smart glass or anything like that.
2607482	2612746	and I guess, you know, Microsoft made a statement regarding the set-up box plans.
2612766	2624233	They're saying Xbox 360 has found new ways to extend the console lifecycle by introducing controller-free experiences with Kinect and reinventing the console with a new dashboard and new entertainment content partnerships.
2624253	2629717	The typical bullshit line they're going to give when the Christmas season is going on and they don't want people to neglect what's happening now.
2629777	2631818	We are always thinking about what is next for our platform.
2631858	2633679	In other words, yeah, that's probably going to be true.
2634620	2637742	Yeah, in other words, don't think about what's coming out next year.
2637882	2640124	Think about putting a Kinect under your Christmas tree this year.
2640644	2641544	That's exactly what it is.
2641645	2646428	I wouldn't put a Kinect under your Christmas tree unless you're into dancing games because all the games that have come out have been kind of crap.
2646448	2647448	You know what I mean.
2647768	2648489	I'm just saying.
2650470	2655391	Okay, I know this is going to sound stupid and I'm going to sound like an idiot, but hear me out here.
2655492	2659973	Could this be a very corporate challenge to the Ouya?
2660693	2670156	And I know that comparison is really weird because I know the Ouya's whole thing is open source and all this, but do you think still maybe Microsoft took a look at that whole thing and said...
2670956	2675782	Maybe people want a $99 thing they just took up to their TV and play games with.
2675822	2679587	And although we sure as hell aren't going to make it open source, maybe we'll make it look like a PC.
2679727	2682411	Like, is this maybe a response to the Ouya, if true?
2683658	2684158	Probably not.
2684198	2688341	I don't think they feel any threat from the OUYA yet, because there's no real system there.
2688361	2690722	I mean, you can't feel a threat about something that's not out yet.
2691643	2696986	Not a threat, but it's doing what Microsoft does, taking an idea and trying to make it better, for better or for worse.
2697006	2697326	I don't think so.
2697346	2700688	I think, if anything, they would be kind of going with the whole...
2701548	2708792	Well, we've seen some of these integrated, maybe even looking at Apple TV or something like that.
2708912	2713954	Obviously, they're just a step away from actually having a system that runs apps and stuff.
2715075	2716776	I don't know if it's really going to...
2718340	2719041	Be anything.
2719081	2722703	I mean, because if you think about it, let's say this comes out a year from now.
2722923	2732149	Why would I want to buy a stripped down version of the Xbox 360 when the regular Xbox 360 is probably going to be under $100 or just about $100?
2732189	2738953	I mean, if you think about it, yes, you may not be able to get the brand new system that's out right now, but those older systems, they're already at about $100 or just over $100.
2739013	2739894	So why would I want to...
2742435	2748739	You know, put out something that's gonna... Maybe if it's one of those funky partnerships where it's all built into the TV.
2749559	2753582	But, see, that's... Why would you buy something like that that's built into the TV?
2753622	2756404	Because... Why do people buy TVs with built-in Blu-ray players?
2756444	2759105	Why do people buy TVs with built-in Roku and so forth?
2759385	2762387	It's like those LaserDisc players that had the Sega CD built in it.
2762547	2762927	It's dumb.
2762947	2766289	You should never buy a TV with something built into it.
2766870	2767970	You know who buys that stuff?
2768031	2768491	My parents.
2768931	2769691	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2793821	2811286	Even though the thing might be capable of doing all this other stuff you're talking about with the more geometry wars and so forth, maybe the push is to grandma who enjoys Farmville now maybe wants apples to apples on her TV or whatever else Microsoft might reveal in the next year game-wise.
2811326	2812587	I got to be honest, though.
2812667	2817208	If you're saying that that's the reason that people would buy these TVs, I don't think those type of people would buy...
2817888	2818508	Thanks for watching!
2836577	2844265	So, well, because it won't just be a gaming console, it'll play the casual games, but it's going to have all of Microsoft's other stuff too.
2844305	2851872	It'll have all those channels with the, you know, the built-in Hulu and the Netflix and all that same shit you see on every console.
2851892	2853073	I just don't think that they're going to do that.
2853093	2856136	And the only reason I don't think they're going to do that is because other people have done it better already.
2856356	2858939	And there's no reason to... Why wouldn't they want a piece of it then?
2859179	2860140	Why wouldn't they want a piece of it?
2860180	2861121	Because I don't think that they...
2861901	2865384	Has that worked out well for them in the whole mobile phone department?
2865504	2870628	Have they really taken a large chunk of the business from Android and iOS?
2871729	2871949	Nope.
2872189	2874491	When does that ever stop Microsoft from trying?
2875852	2876072	Well...
2877433	2883116	I think that they're definitely not trying as hard with Windows Phone 8 and stuff.
2883636	2888539	It's probably selling alright, but I don't hear people going, Oh, I need a Windows Phone 8.
2888999	2895703	It's more like, I need an iPhone 5, or I need the next spiffy Android phone that's going to come out.
2895763	2903207	Yeah, it's a possibility that they'll come out with something like this to try to get people in, but I don't know why you would do it.
2905060	2913442	Let's just say that there are people that will buy things that don't make sense.
2914022	2914442	Why not?
2915343	2917603	Let me move on with some more news.
2917743	2923205	This is about some things that have gone on in the Wii U front since the console launched.
2924705	2929469	Some folks talking about a Miiverse hack and that Miiverse was hacked and all this.
2929549	2931111	That's not really what happened.
2931691	2937737	Somebody on NeoGAF said that they were screwing around with Miiverse and they were able to get into the debug and admin options of Miiverse.
2940739	2942441	Sounds like that wasn't really what it is.
2943242	2944563	At least that's what Nintendo's claiming.
2944923	2946985	Nintendo's saying it was a prototype.
2947705	2953590	Nintendo did send out a statement to GamesIndustry.biz saying that what the user found was a mock-up menu.
2953751	2954832	It's no longer there.
2955572	2956433	It's inaccessible.
2957033	2966462	And that could be believable enough, especially if Miu, at its core, is basically running off a web protocol, which is certainly possible.
2967142	2968344	I think that's absolutely possible.
2968384	2972211	The whole damn thing is running off a web-type-based protocol and we just kind of don't see it.
2972732	2973092	Why not?
2974334	2975236	It's probably very easy.
2975617	2976157	So whatever.
2976218	2978782	I mean, I'm spouting like I know what I'm talking about.
2982515	2988159	It probably wasn't hard to find something like this in there, and I don't think it's very serious, especially if it was a mock-up.
2988219	2992782	I mean, even just kind of looking at all the information on the screen, I don't think it's a big deal.
2994343	3002390	Anyway, if you want to know the full statement, quote, It has come to our attention that some of the people were able to access a mock-up menu on Miiverse following the launch of Wii U in the U.S.
3002750	3006793	Please know that this is only a mock-up menu and has now been removed and is not accessible.
3007033	3010796	Remember how we were talking about those doors that you open up and just, wham, you run into a wall?
3011137	3013729	Here's another one of those trap doors right there.
3013749	3015195	All right.
3015777	3016558	Someone stumbled.
3017878	3021921	One other bit on the Wii U. You've got to give Nintendo credit for this.
3022601	3042353	This is a comment from Frozenbyte who made Trine 2, which is one of the download titles available on Wii U. You may not know this because it hasn't been talked about as much as the launch game, but there are five download-only games available on the Wii U. I'm not talking about the retail end, but I'm talking about $15 download games available on Wii U right now.
3042753	3044174	I personally have not tried any yet.
3045034	3045875	but they're available.
3045915	3047375	I've had friends Do they have demos?
3048636	3049477	Not now, no.
3049817	3054779	Wow, Nintendo way to be in the forefront of digital content.
3054839	3055640	Fuck.
3056400	3057901	PlayStation 1 had demos.
3058161	3059482	Well, but the Wii has demos.
3059722	3062963	So again, I'm going to say, was it ready to go by November 18th?
3063243	3064624	Look for it in December and January.
3064704	3065525	That's the way it's going to be.
3066926	3067406	It'll happen.
3067746	3069248	It just wasn't ready November 18th.
3069928	3072210	But, okay, so they may not have demos, whatever.
3072230	3074372	But let me get to this, because I do think this is worth mentioning.
3074753	3078716	So Frozen Byte, they made Trine 2, which is probably one of the more visible titles that's there.
3079417	3091909	A quote from Mikael Haveri, who's the marketing manager, quote, "...we have the power to price our products as we please, with just some basic guidelines from the big guys."
3092389	3098792	The step to this is purely from Nintendo's side and they can clearly see that their previous installments have not been up to par.
3099392	3104654	We can set our own pricing and actually continuing on that by setting our own sales whenever we want.
3105114	3110597	It is very close to what Apple and Steam are doing at the moment and very indie friendly.
3111777	3112638	So in other words...
3113778	3121984	Nintendo's tried to fix some of this and make the DLC part of the download distribution component of the Wii U a little bit lucrative.
3122524	3123345	Free patches!
3124065	3125946	You can do patching all you want for free.
3126987	3135673	Considering we've heard the bitches from folks who make the Xbox Live Arcade games complain about the pricing of the patching over there, that suddenly makes this very lucrative.
3135713	3140936	Being able to put your own game on sale when you want and all that, that's going to make this a lot more attractive.
3141377	3142918	It will be interesting to see if
3144059	3163102	you know if it actually leads to the games being made because that's what it's really about if that happens though if there'll be any response from Microsoft and Sony but you got to admit Nintendo's doing the right thing there yeah so very interesting it makes good sense
3163672	3170355	Yep, they've told us there are no basic payments for each patch and we can update our game almost as much as we want.
3170715	3172556	For indie developers, this is huge.
3172576	3175457	I wonder if that might be a lure for Minecraft.
3175517	3175877	Who knows?
3177218	3177598	Who knows?
3178018	3180379	I like to just throw making up stuff out there.
3181360	3185962	SSJ100Map in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com wanted to bring this up about the demos.
3186462	3188423	Wii U has kiosk demos.
3188883	3190124	I'm sure it will happen soon.
3191784	3195567	Jason wants to point out, Loki, iOS doesn't have demos.
3197668	3198568	That's not true.
3198748	3199569	That's not true either.
3199749	3200910	It's up to the developer.
3200930	3201890	There's light versions.
3202070	3206233	Yeah, there's that whole light thing that they do, and now the whole in-app purchases.
3206253	3213297	You don't think about it because it's different than how Xbox and PlayStation does demos, but developers found a way to do it.
3215259	3218162	It'll be interesting to see how that plays out on Wii U if it does.
3218863	3219844	All right, moving on with more news.
3219884	3220344	DarkSakura.
3220664	3221025	Oh, wait.
3221065	3222146	I was going to add one last thing.
3222186	3222546	Yeah, go ahead.
3222666	3224929	There is actually some Wii hacks that actually happen.
3225209	3225750	Oh.
3225990	3231395	Legit stuff that... It's not necessarily the Wii U, but it's in the Wii...
3233257	3234358	I fucking hate how they have this.
3235199	3240686	The Wii Channel on the Wii U because that makes all the sense in the world.
3241567	3245331	I will say, I might be the only person who didn't transfer their Wii stuff over.
3245571	3248935	Like, I don't see the benefit of doing that right now.
3249776	3251698	Can a chatter sway me that I'm wrong on that?
3251878	3253020	Why would I want to do that?
3253928	3254689	I don't know.
3255189	3261014	But there's a loader that was available for the Wii using Super Smash Bros.
3261074	3263696	Brawl called Stack Smash.
3263796	3268000	And what it basically does is it uses a modified brawl stage.
3270441	3296856	save file to run unsigned code and that exploit still works on the Wii U and so you can actually run Wii Homebrew through the Wii channel on the Wii U and they've even gotten there was a game that was played in one of the videos I saw here also they're saying that basically not everything works like you can't use the hacks you know to create like the Homebrew channel and stuff like that
3297416	3308860	But they're saying right now, nothing that requires HackMe uses, I guess, the current kernel exploits or uses AHB prods will work.
3309200	3313582	It says that includes Devolution, USB Loader, CIOS installers, and WeLinux.
3314342	3318707	But it says Nintendo cannot patch StackSmash using their current architecture.
3318827	3325255	While it's technically possible, it would require a lot of work on their part, and it could result in Super Smash Bros.
3325335	3327657	Brawl being unstable for all users.
3327778	3333244	Plus, it's most likely they knew that that would work before the guy posted the video.
3333584	3345315	so in other words hackers gonna hack they're looking frantically for a way in that device the clock is running how fast can they find the way into the Wii U and they already have found kind of a way in
3345683	3354990	Yeah, they found a kind of way in and they've also, there was a video here that I guess they're dumping the console keys from the Wii mode stuff.
3356111	3359773	I don't really know what exactly they would use with that, but still interesting, I guess.
3361074	3368740	Interesting to note, though, Nintendo is kind of doing something where, you know, well, I guess Microsoft kind of does this, too, whenever you connect to live games.
3368960	3370882	is that it's going to automatically download firmware.
3370962	3373364	I mean, it'll download it overnight when it's not on and all that.
3373464	3376586	It's kind of like more how PlayStation Plus kind of does it.
3378087	3384112	In theory, I mean, we haven't seen it happen firsthand yet because there's only been the one patch, which most people do when you first turn on the system.
3384352	3384993	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3399628	3402231	Which I really wish they had the ring light stuff on there.
3402331	3403673	There were the messages.
3404534	3408218	You have the blue, it's now the home button on the pad is a blue light.
3408518	3411121	And whenever friends sign on and off, that little light lights up.
3411221	3413263	Yeah, that's just not as sexy as it was on the Wii.
3413404	3417048	It's not, but I just want to point out it's sort of there.
3417889	3418329	Sort of there.
3420604	3421806	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3436187	3439412	The R4 is a flash cartridge that works on the DS.
3439532	3442838	You can use homebrew or pirated games on the system.
3443919	3450330	And there's also ones called, like, I had a Ninja Pass was one that I had that doesn't work anymore.
3452272	3477607	but now Nintendo has really got a push on and got it with the Japanese government that the R4 is now illegal to sell in Japan actually like it's completely banned by the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry it was illegal to sell since 2009 but importing it is completely illegal now as far as
3479168	3480489	Other places that it's been banned.
3480529	3482690	It's now banned in France and the UK.
3483331	3488354	Amazon and eBay are no longer allowing this cartridge to be sold.
3489214	3496279	And different Australian distributors have been successfully sued by Nintendo.
3497119	3503904	I'm assuming it's still pretty available in the age-old venue of discreet brown paper bags in lavatories.
3504364	3504824	Probably.
3504984	3505465	Yeah, probably.
3506005	3508146	I mean, if I wanted one, I could go get one.
3508606	3509346	There's ways to get it.
3509386	3510447	You can order them online.
3511247	3516589	But it's now specifically illegal to import them in Japan.
3517029	3520090	Not just sell them like it was the rule.
3520290	3521250	You can't import it.
3521810	3523631	I mean, you could, but you could go to jail.
3524918	3528501	or have them stare at you sternly and force you to kill yourself.
3528682	3540052	Well, probably a lot of it has to do with, you know, how out there you're being too because, like, in Australia, you weren't... I think it wasn't illegal to import the M-rated games because they had been banned in Australia.
3540072	3541593	Like, I remember Mortal Kombat, the new one.
3542214	3549281	Like, isn't it, like, illegal to, like, send... I mean, now maybe it's not because of the whole new rating board but before it was, like, illegal to send a copy over there.
3549661	3550001	But, like...
3551062	3553864	How are they really going to find each and every person that does it?
3553964	3554985	Not that I'm encouraging it.
3555205	3557487	I think we all know why the R4 cart's being banned.
3558528	3560909	Although... You can still buy them, of course.
3561170	3561790	Of course you can.
3562030	3571637	We remember the beginning of 2010, there was that UK guy who went to jail for a year for importing 26,000 games to set up with an R4.
3577779	3581802	There's a difference between 26,000 games and me going on Craigslist.
3582302	3582542	Yeah.
3583483	3587626	Well, regardless, if people want something badly enough, they're going to find a way to make it happen.
3588086	3591529	It's just that now it's officially a punishable crime.
3592409	3592710	The end.
3594291	3596012	And Nintendo just wants to put more hurdles up.
3596612	3597393	They want to make it harder.
3597413	3599254	They want to protect their product.
3599815	3601476	They're certainly well within their rights to do it.
3602805	3603185	I get it.
3603646	3611832	I mean, if you think about it, and I hate to say this, it was how easily replicated games were for Dreamcast that contributed to the Dreamcast failure.
3612272	3615475	Nintendo is already sitting kind of in a precarious position.
3615755	3615955	Right.
3616255	3618537	So, of course they're going to want to protect their investment.
3618908	3627599	Which is a bummer because, you know, the homebrew element of it, you want to embrace, you want to be able to say like, yeah, people should be able to run homebrew on it.
3627659	3636129	But unfortunately, 95% of people, I pulled that number completely out of my ass, aren't really using it for, well, they're using it for homebrew and other things, you know.
3636670	3638452	See, I wanted to play fan translations.
3640237	3642298	But, you know, it's not in the cards.
3642318	3644458	Although technically that's illegal too, if you think about it.
3644798	3646239	Yeah, well, they can bite my ass.
3646359	3646999	Yeah, I know.
3647079	3650800	That's always... I always feel like that too, and I've talked about this on the show.
3650860	3652701	That's when I feel justified in piracy.
3653501	3654902	And I know that's a controversial opinion.
3654942	3657402	I know you may not agree with me there and what have you.
3657442	3661964	But if a company just isn't going to do it, then...
3663024	3668347	Let me just freaking get the translation version or, you know, let me get it from the other country.
3668407	3670429	You know, I went off on this with Xenoblade.
3671709	3682516	You know, it's people who really like a series that's going to put that fun, you know, that effort into it, you know, and it really should actually more send a signal to the companies that fans want this.
3682576	3686479	I mean, like what happened with, crap, what was that game that was on the Wii?
3687059	3687479	Xenoblade.
3687599	3688300	Xenoblade, yeah.
3688660	3689881	Of course people wanted Xenoblade.
3690761	3692503	And it was already, you know, in English.
3693544	3694805	But no one really knew it.
3694825	3697628	And then they did it because, you know, they realized, hey, it's stupid.
3697848	3698649	People do want it.
3701091	3702273	Apparently, last story.
3703359	3705020	Smart Strategy Smart Strategy
3733526	3736687	Frisbee seems to agree with us in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com.
3736988	3741349	If you don't sell a product to a country, they can't complain about lost sales due to downloading.
3741869	3743210	I know that's a controversial opinion.
3743230	3744991	I know it stinks, but I'm kind of like, you know what?
3745011	3745851	It's technically right.
3746051	3752414	The internet puts us in a more global community than companies want to sometimes acknowledge, and that's just the reality.
3752714	3755615	And if you feel so bad about it, why don't you freaking import it?
3757113	3760975	Import fees are so freaking expensive, though, and then region locking and all that crap.
3760995	3762856	Where's my Disaster, Dead, and Crisis?
3763537	3765177	There was another game that was in English.
3765458	3770580	All right, let's move on with more news.
3771481	3774382	So Sony's credit rating is kind of crap.
3775863	3777504	They're probably going to have to go to one of those...
3778084	3781885	Credit agencies that they advertise on TV, but not really.
3782766	3792268	So apparently one of the credit rating boards, I guess, out there, agencies, Fitch Ratings has rated them junk status.
3792729	3796390	Also, there was another company, I guess, Moody's, who I've never heard of.
3797110	3798750	I actually haven't heard either one of them.
3799231	3802392	They've dropped theirs to, I guess, one notch above junk.
3802492	3803072	So I guess...
3804733	3807575	It would be some people.
3808235	3811717	Some may call this junk, but I call them treasures, I guess.
3812278	3817001	That level.
3817041	3824946	They said the downgrade reflects Fitch's belief that the meaningful recovery will be slow given the company's loss of technology, leadership, and key products.
3825346	3829769	High competition, weak economic conditions in developed markets, and the strong yen.
3832085	3833246	So, yeah.
3833846	3839949	So it's a company saying that they're going to fail, and I guess we just have to wait for them to either do so or not.
3840049	3840410	Amix?
3841850	3842591	Am I correct, though?
3842631	3847674	I mean, I'm not upping up on all my financial world stuff, but I believe this doesn't mean Sony...
3848454	3855899	is failing, it means that the analysts believe it's going to tank because they see the downward trend.
3856460	3864805	It's basically saying, hey, banks that are lending Sony money, they're at more of a risk on not being able to pay those loans back.
3866226	3869728	Even though they're a big company, big companies file bankruptcy all the time.
3870689	3872010	Twinkies.
3872290	3877974	Yeah, but also, how many of Sony's CEOs are giving themselves raises every four months?
3879639	3886254	I don't know, but also you're talking about more of a global company than Hostess was Sony's based in Japan, it's a very different culture there
3886624	3893509	True, but I mean, it's still, if they have sound business practices and deal ethically, then I think that they can turn around.
3894790	3898973	What happened with Hostess was a pure bout of greed and poor regulation.
3899193	3902475	Well, one thing with Sony is that they're more than games, too.
3902515	3903316	We have to remember.
3903356	3911862	There's a whole lot of other facets of Sony, and even though their games may be doing okay, although I think people wish the PlayStation 3 were doing better, especially the Vita.
3912182	3913663	It sounds like they're not doing well on the Vita.
3913863	3936151	I think that they weren't doing well in just like some of the other fields like for example Sony phones aren't you know Ericsson's not really a big thing anymore TVs they everybody goes off brand and gets the the Black Friday $200 TVs however Toshiba and Panasonic and Samsung have really pushed in LG especially those brands have really surpassed Sony in quality though
3936371	3941933	And I don't think people are buying cameras as much anymore because now the cameras and camera phones are alright.
3942093	3946954	I mean, they're multi-megapixel cameras and for a lot of people that's just enough.
3946974	3950976	They don't need anything dedicated to just a camera unless you're actually really into photography.
3951236	3952576	Well, I'll tell you this.
3952976	3958358	My iPhone camera is tons better than the Digital Rebel that my husband bought four years ago.
3959888	3964472	Dungeon Buster in our chat room, Sony has a lot of internal issues that contributed to their failure.
3964532	3966594	They have had a lot of shifting and things going on lately.
3967234	3972319	Bob Coffee says the strong yen is what's fucking Japanese companies bad, that exchange rate.
3974741	3980926	Dungeon Buster also clarifies his earlier comment saying all of their competitors hired who they tried to force into early retirement.
3983633	3990358	So, yeah, we have to remember Sony is more than just games, but it's not like their games are performing, especially the Vita.
3990538	3994260	I mean, that's not looking pretty for Sony right now.
3994400	4001085	Another thing, too, is that companies in Japan don't have the rules regarding single types of products, too.
4001105	4005989	Like, for example, Toyota also makes housing siding.
4006469	4008651	Takara makes toys and wine.
4009291	4014055	You know, the companies are allowed to branch out into other areas and expand.
4014095	4021241	I mean, how else, I think, could Nintendo go from a card company to a computer entertainment company?
4022562	4036453	But I think the point is, though, is that first of all, I agree with the comment regarding the strength of the yen, but especially when you're dealing on an international market with other economies that you're relying on that don't have as strong fundage
4037233	4039734	Then, yeah, you're going to run into a lot of problems on the exchange as well.
4041275	4048597	Since I brought up the Vita, I do want to remind people, if you've been neglecting your Vita, PlayStation Plus just came out on the Vita, and there was a 2.0 patch for everybody.
4049298	4052059	So just, you know, go turn on your Vita if you haven't in a while.
4052439	4054840	I didn't play enough of this game to really review it this week.
4054880	4055840	I'll talk about it next week.
4055900	4059722	But my early impressions of Gravity Rush, which is one of the free games on Plus right now...
4061622	4063143	Neat.
4063383	4064703	I'm really liking what I see.
4064923	4068984	It's like one of these games I'm like, I think people totally missed this.
4069024	4070205	I mean, I know it has its fans.
4070565	4072605	I've heard some people talking about it on Twitter and so forth.
4072665	4076206	But more people should be talking about Gravity Rush.
4076266	4078007	It's pretty great from what I've played of it so far.
4078667	4081948	And that's a free one on PlayStation Plus and the Uncharted game, of course.
4081968	4082448	And Wipeout.
4082548	4084989	Wipeout was one of the best looking games that launched.
4086929	4090732	and Tactics PSP, which, you know, some of you might not have even bothered to pick up or whatever.
4090772	4091352	It's free.
4091592	4094154	So PlayStation Plus on Vita, looking nice right now.
4094214	4098677	So if you have a Vita and you happen to have PlayStation Plus, I would really urge you to go check that free shit out.
4099418	4107464	Even if you don't want to, the 2.0 upgrade allows the wireless transmissions, which is one of those, duh, this thing should have been there in the beginning and all those features, which is great.
4107784	4109245	So there you go.
4109918	4114842	and Shadow Next Gen does want to say in chat, actually, PlayStation is losing Sony money right now.
4115223	4116604	The Vita has hurt them a lot.
4116684	4123190	Yeah, I mentioned the Vita earlier and I just, the sales in Japan and the US and everywhere really don't look good.
4123290	4133999	I think their opportunity with some of these games I think was that the company that worked on Resistance and did the Call of Duty Vita versions, it's
4134179	4135799	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4158405	4159345	Total crap.
4159885	4162266	Yeah, it's like, what happened to that?
4162366	4162786	What was it?
4162826	4168388	Was it Game Developers Conference or one of those where Sony just came out and said, we've got over 100 games coming to the Vita.
4170708	4171168	Where are they?
4173309	4173769	What happened?
4175330	4177130	Final Fantasy X, we're going to remake that.
4177670	4177910	When?
4179951	4180291	I don't know.
4181791	4182031	Uh-oh.
4182151	4183272	Are people abandoning ship?
4183312	4183872	What's happening?
4184152	4184232	Oh.
4185714	4187596	Earth Defense Force 2017, Portable comes out.
4202552	4204814	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4224349	4227650	I tried playing that, and it's like, oh, hey, cool, it's not updating.
4227950	4229151	Awesome.
4230011	4232112	It works all right for me.
4233072	4237014	Again, I think I called it bubble wrap on last week's show, and that's pretty much what it is.
4237454	4238615	There's not really a game there.
4238675	4239575	It's just tap, tap, tap.
4239936	4241616	You can do combos.
4242497	4242857	Come on.
4243097	4245998	It's pressing squares to make them disappear.
4246058	4246999	It's not rocket science.
4248081	4249523	Thank you for watching!
4266405	4268827	Um, which is supposed to be a reinvention of Populous.
4269727	4278833	I thought, actually, I gotta be honest, as much as I think Curiosity is interesting and all, that was tacky as shit, having that Kickstarter in there.
4279673	4287918	I wouldn't put it past Molyneux, though, you know, as the more I was thinking about it, I was like, that is so a thing for him to do.
4288618	4290519	But anyway, I just found that tacky as shit.
4291080	4291340	But...
4292080	4300106	And regardless, I think it's neat that he's revisiting the Populous idea because I think that game in particular was a great game.
4301247	4304149	So that is something that he started a Kickstarter for.
4304349	4306211	It's available on, of course, Kickstarter.
4307752	4314197	They want 450,000 pounds to do the Rebirth of God games for PC only.
4314597	4316058	IOS, and Android.
4317340	4322424	And you can look at more details on the Kickstarter if you want about what all you can get from it.
4322804	4325947	But that is on his plate for games he wants to do.
4326467	4331432	I thought that 22 Cans had these other games lined up.
4331492	4332653	I remember reading about one.
4332693	4336176	I thought the next game was supposed to be Cooperation or something was supposed to be the next game for 22 Cans.
4336796	4338016	So I don't know where this fits into it.
4338177	4345239	If this is like an actual 22... Because remember, 22 cans is because Molyneux's got 22 ideas for iOS games.
4346679	4347019	Whatever.
4347740	4349420	I don't know where this fits into it.
4349640	4354042	I don't know if this is one of the 22 or if this is like a bonus or what, but... No.
4354322	4355742	I hope it's as good as Populous.
4355802	4356442	I guess that's all I can say.
4356462	4357423	I'm not giving him any money.
4357683	4357783	No.
4359375	4363078	I just... I was kind of turned off by the ad in Curiosity.
4363819	4366141	Like, I don't... I can't explain it.
4366221	4367642	Like, it just... It was tacky.
4368683	4369003	I don't know.
4369344	4371065	It turned me off to Curiosity, too.
4371505	4372907	Is that what we're tapping away at?
4372947	4374548	The big mystery in advertisement?
4375429	4375729	Hmm.
4377050	4377771	All right, let's move on.
4378351	4378812	DarkSakura.
4379833	4381214	My computer just did something bizarre.
4381334	4381614	Hold on.
4382835	4383215	There we go.
4384076	4384276	So...
4386551	4398621	So, as was teased earlier when we talked to Bobby, there's a game that I'm super excited about that's coming out on the 3DS through the Nintendo eShop.
4399301	4402364	And that is Space Harrier!
4403164	4404285	Yay!
4405366	4410509	Mind you, it's not like I think the Sega Ages one.
4410689	4416753	It's a currently redone 3D version of Space Harrier.
4417354	4420396	So I'm pretty excited about that because it's one of my favorite games ever.
4421196	4421296	And...
4422637	4426320	I'd actually, I think I've put it as like number three on my top games list.
4426480	4432204	Like number one being The Guardian Legend, number two being Fantasy Zone, and number three being Space Harrier.
4433505	4435346	So, welcome to the Fantasy Zone.
4435806	4436126	Get ready.
4438008	4439049	Now you gotta get a 3DS.
4441390	4442471	You wanna know what's funny, Rob?
4442791	4444973	I have about seven versions of Space Harrier at home.
4445813	4446854	Tell me you don't want this one.
4448143	4448844	One of my Sega Ages 1s.
4467617	4469758	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4485166	4486327	Pretty much just a couple things.
4486827	4490149	You've got the American Mensa Academy on the 3DS.
4491949	4496051	Ratchet and Clank Full Frontal Assault on PS3.
4498032	4500873	Kids Learn and Play Pets and Vets on the DS.
4503374	4508036	And... I think that actually might be it.
4508997	4509217	Um...
4512018	4516519	Oh, Scribblenot's Unlimited on PC because I guess that wasn't ready to go yet.
4517920	4524061	All right, well, traveling to Japan, since it's a little different over there and they didn't really have Black Friday, you still have some games coming out in Japan.
4524762	4533724	Starting on the Xbox 360, you have Darksiders 2 comes out as well as Love Tor, Love Toray probably, mint version in limited and regular editions.
4534344	4536685	And this is a sequel to Sweet.
4537965	4541126	For a moment, I thought you said Toire, which means toilet.
4542179	4542819	Love Toilet?
4543039	4543300	Yeah.
4543560	4545741	No, I don't think these girls are having fun in the Love Toilet.
4545761	4546881	That's what it says, Toray.
4546901	4547962	Toray.
4548042	4548322	Let's see.
4548682	4550503	Let me read the little description for this.
4550543	4551243	Hold on.
4551323	4552024	Go away, box art.
4552044	4553304	I'll go back to the description here.
4553344	4555285	I think I would play a game called Love Toilet.
4556666	4557967	You are faced with a new problem.
4557987	4560768	The school wants you to win the National Dance Championship.
4561088	4564970	The girls are not used to disciplined practices and the student club president is against you.
4565410	4573253	The biggest problem, however, is that you enter the championship as pairs, and the girl you want to dance with would most certainly prefer pairing up with another girl than dancing with you.
4573654	4577475	However, protecting the club is your job, so swallow your pride and dance on.
4577755	4579676	This is like the plot to, like, Bring It On 3.
4581437	4583258	Box description, gigantic soulless eyes.
4591561	4591961	Kinda.
4592742	4594863	Alright, let's move on to the PlayStation 3.
4595363	4601265	On the PlayStation 3, Darksiders 2 is there as well, as well as Power Smash 4 going into the Sega The Best collection.
4601905	4606327	Shinsengoku Musou Online Ryujin Oranbu 5th Anniversary Pack.
4606387	4610269	That's probably just a repackaging of Shinsengoku.
4610909	4614510	Sports Champions 2 makes its way to Japan on the 29th as well.
4615030	4618592	And Dai 2G Super Robot Taisen Original Generations.
4619412	4622035	in the regular and Blu-ray disc box.
4622095	4624037	So that's probably one of them combo packs.
4625238	4636310	Looking at the PlayStation Vita this week, Fate Stay Night, Power Smash 4, price reduction there as well, and Samurai and Dragons, Ryuzoku Kuren.
4637623	4646536	as well as a new game called Totori no Atelier Plus, Arland no Renken Sushi 2 comes out over there as well.
4646797	4651483	Sorry to interrupt, but is Samurais and Dragons pretty much their version of Cowboys and Aliens?
4652805	4653585	It very well might be.
4653645	4654005	I don't know.
4654066	4654366	I don't know.
4654726	4656066	I've heard these Atelier games, though.
4656086	4658027	There's one of them on PlayStation 3 out here.
4658107	4660188	There's a few out on PlayStation 3 out here.
4660268	4660888	Look at these two.
4661908	4665369	I don't think these two chicks who are embracing in this picture are wearing a top.
4665990	4666710	Just pointing out.
4666850	4667330	Or illegal.
4668190	4668711	Or illegal.
4668831	4669331	Just saying.
4669731	4672092	They're embracing in a bathhouse, I'm sure.
4673312	4675373	The graphics look pretty, though, outside of that picture.
4675473	4676854	Very cel shading and all that.
4678674	4682416	Tatori brings her tools, her books, and everything colorful to the PS Vita.
4682796	4685858	Forget about saving the world, you have more important business to attend to.
4686278	4692741	Namely, collecting your ingredients, learning new recipes, creating powerful items, and completing missions set by the guild.
4693041	4695963	In this game where you have a schedule to follow, every moment counts.
4696363	4698204	You got served cross bring it on equals moe moe powa
4721625	4724006	On the Wii U in Japan, not yet.
4724267	4728650	December 8th is the big day, so we got another week to go before we talk about Wii U in Japan.
4729310	4734694	But we can talk about the Nintendo 3DS and Naruto SD Powerful Shippuden.
4735215	4737276	Because what would the week be without a Naruto game?
4737677	4739838	Also, Leighton Kaiju vs...
4740779	4743201	and Gaikoten Saiban comes out for level 5.
4756337	4758920	I thought this was a thing in development.
4759001	4761544	I didn't realize this was coming out in Japan now.
4761564	4761964	Yeah.
4762645	4763827	Did you watch the trailer for this?
4764227	4766010	I think I did a long time ago now that you talk about it.
4766030	4766791	Pretty epic.
4767472	4767972	It's pretty cool.
4769134	4771917	Sort of semi-off topic, there is now a Phoenix Wright movie.
4772418	4772979	Oh yeah, oh yeah.
4773059	4773359	Yes.
4775061	4778862	So hopefully something will get here a little easier to obtain.
4779622	4782723	Well, I guess the internet's not much easier than that, but you know.
4783904	4785604	Alright, that's going to do it for Japanese releases.
4785664	4787065	Let's go over to the UK, DarkSakura.
4787265	4789746	On the 26th, we have LEGO Lord of the Rings.
4789866	4793827	On the 27th, we have Battlefield 3 Aftermath and Mass Effect 3 Omega!
4794540	4797563	I'm glad that for DLC it gets its own release date.
4797983	4798984	That just makes me so happy.
4799664	4801386	Because they respect Mass Effect.
4802847	4810934	On the 20th of November, Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition, Miyazmata on PC, and Stealth Bastard Deluxe.
4811234	4813075	That's the best name, Stealth Bastard.
4813876	4815457	Or maybe it'd be Stealth Bastard.
4816999	4819401	You know, Eddie Izzard is to be believed.
4821050	4836217	On the 29th, Aeroporter on 3DS, the 30th, Ben 10 Omniverse, Epic Mickey 2, The Power of 2, Far Cry 3, FIFA 13, Little Inferno, Warriors Orochi 3 Hyper, the Wii U, Zone of the Enders HD Collection.
4837178	4843001	And let me see what I've got for if there's anything on December 1st.
4843041	4843441	Hold on.
4844542	4846383	God, I can't believe it's already almost December.
4848284	4848924	Nope, nothing until the 4th.
4850782	4854143	All right, just a couple more news stories for you guys, and then the classic game of the week.
4854243	4854903	But first, Loki.
4855463	4855643	Yes.
4856243	4859584	So let's talk a little bit about Telltale Games.
4860024	4865505	And thankfully, it's not about them closing down, but actually, they're expanding starting spring 2013.
4867025	4871366	And what they're going to do is, I guess, they're moving out of their current office.
4871566	4875767	They're going to, I guess, get an office that's almost twice as big.
4876627	4896100	and right now they're looking to um up their staff by looks like 35 people um starting in March and April of 2013 and I guess um that's good news that they're doing well so they've got you know of course a lot of games out right now they just finished up the second season of walking or I guess
4896520	4898462	Yeah, they're working on the second season of Walking Dead.
4898482	4899924	The first season just finished.
4900564	4907091	Actually, it should be coming out on a disc retail version two weeks from now.
4909253	4909573	Pretty cool.
4913913	4917293	I hear great things about The Walking Dead.
4917513	4919754	I have heard so much good stuff about that.
4919774	4923135	A lot of people saying that's the game of the year right there is The Walking Dead.
4923595	4925175	I just haven't had a chance to play it.
4925195	4927016	There's so much stuff going on right now.
4927176	4930297	There's a new game every day.
4930757	4934378	But I want to take the time to sit down and play The Walking Dead at some point.
4935758	4940159	Some people on Twitter went so far as to say it is the best ending ever in a video game.
4941556	4942336	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4966127	4968389	Regardless, it sounds like it came out better than Jurassic Park.
4968870	4970492	But to be fair, I didn't play that either.
4971172	4972674	Now that song is stuck in my head.
4972914	4974456	What, Jurassic Park is Frightening in the Dark?
4974896	4977559	Jurassic Park is Frightening in the Dark.
4978340	4978680	All right.
4979901	4980322	Let's see.
4980782	4985887	One more on Ubisoft and a comment they made this week about this current console generation.
4986588	4990811	Ubisoft doesn't want the next console generation to go quite as long.
4991552	4993773	This was in a talk with Polygon.
4994434	4996615	I can never say this guy's name right.
4996675	4997296	Sorry in advance.
4997556	4999197	Yves Guillemot?
4999217	4999958	I don't know.
4999978	5002019	It's French.
5002059	5003260	How would you say that right there?
5004341	5004721	Wimote?
5006205	5006745	William Maltz?
5006886	5010567	Well, because that's basically... Y.V.S.
5010687	5011348	Guillemot.
5013669	5014689	I think it would be Yves.
5015330	5017071	Yeah, he's the CEO at Ubisoft.
5017231	5017411	What?
5017491	5017991	It's Yves.
5018071	5019172	Ha ha, I'm French.
5019592	5019972	Stop it.
5020352	5025775	All right, he's the CEO at Ubisoft, and he said that basically, you know, it's kind of taken a while for hardware to come out.
5026935	5031057	Quote, we are used to the changing machines every five years.
5032477	5039259	When a console is out for a long time, you don't take as much risks on totally new IPs because even if they are good, they don't sell as well.
5039560	5046182	That's kind of an interesting comment because Zombie U is an Ubisoft game on the Wii U.
5047389	5048030	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5067873	5074578	So he's basically saying that when a console's out for a long time, you don't want to take risks because they don't sell as well.
5077140	5081884	Is that the reason that it feels like this cycle has gone on way too long?
5081924	5084166	Or is that the rise of the mobile phone industry?
5084206	5084787	I'm not sure.
5085487	5089851	I really get bothered though when I keep seeing like, oh, traditional game companies.
5090191	5092173	I saw one article somewhere this week that was like,
5092873	5093413	Thanks for watching!
5112466	5115609	The Apple iPhone cannot game the way a console can.
5115629	5119794	When I get Mass Effect fully on my phone, maybe, but Infiltrator doesn't cut it.
5120214	5122096	Infiltrator kind of sucks.
5122156	5123738	Like, it looks good, but the controls ruin it.
5123758	5126141	I touched it, but... The controls ruin it.
5126341	5127302	Oh, Rob, I touched it.
5129584	5129744	So...
5134068	5138391	How can the next console generation be shorter?
5138411	5142434	They're not going to sell consoles saying, oh, well, we'll have a new one out in just four years.
5142855	5148119	They kind of want to encourage people that this next console may have to be the last one they ever buy.
5148991	5150191	Although we all know that's not true.
5150231	5152192	I mean, you'll still be upgrading your PCs.
5152652	5158434	But even, you know, Alan kind of made a point the other day that even PC upgrades have kind of slowed a little bit.
5159095	5163576	Like, especially like now versus maybe where we were at 10 years ago in like the same time.
5163856	5166457	Like it's, you know, we've kind of hit this cap.
5168158	5168458	I don't know.
5169938	5170218	All right.
5171419	5174940	Black Wolf in our chat room says, gaming on my TV will never die.
5176661	5177261	Amen to that.
5178727	5179929	I fucking hate that show.
5179969	5180790	I also hate Sons of Anarchy.
5196287	5198609	I mean, yeah, okay, the acting in both are great.
5198910	5200231	I hate the subject matter.
5200831	5202152	I hate how the episodes go.
5202273	5208939	I hate basically awful, horrible people being put in a positive spotlight.
5210320	5214203	You know, okay, yeah, Hitler was an artist, but that doesn't mean I'm a fan.
5215384	5218007	Painting an apartment in one afternoon, two coats.
5220389	5221970	I only have time to watch RuPaul's Drag Race.
5222450	5222730	All right.
5224951	5232214	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on vognetwork.com, use the passphrase mouse.
5233295	5236956	Let's travel to a time when we didn't even have these mobile phones.
5236976	5239177	They were called car phones, not mobile phones.
5239197	5240638	Not even when this was out of date.
5241789	5242149	DarkSakura.com
5257862	5265008	I don't think there's very many people that are going to judge you for doing another mother game.
5265048	5268470	This series is beloved by a lot of people.
5287867	5289909	Yeah, I need to actually break out my copy and play it.
5291391	5293453	Yes, I do have this game.
5294174	5302203	But in Japan, it was Mother 2 Giga no Gyakushu, which I don't know what Gyakushu means, so somebody translate for me.
5302904	5303905	Oh, I knew that once.
5305406	5305767	Probably...
5307288	5308049	Giggs Revenge.
5309570	5310270	Something like that.
5311011	5316434	At any rate, when it came out with the Attract demo, there were two different names.
5316554	5321758	One was Earthbound, The War Against Giygas, and the other one was Mother 2.
5324260	5328743	However they've written it, G-Y-I-Y-G, that's a weird way to spell it, strikes back.
5330524	5336708	It was designed by Shigesato Itoi, and it was actually the sequel to Mother.
5337769	5340112	I was going to say, he was the last boss in the game.
5340132	5341394	That's why he's named that.
5343097	5345080	Well, no, I know that was his name.
5345741	5347163	I didn't know why they spelled it that way.
5348510	5349611	because it's very weird.
5350992	5366745	At any rate, the game was released on August 27, 1994 in Japan and in America as Earthbound on June 5, 1995 as a standalone, as not a sequel to anything because we didn't know.
5366825	5368486	Who did we have to import back then, huh?
5369027	5372049	We had Final Fantasy VI as Final Fantasy III.
5372109	5372689	Come on.
5372910	5373190	Yeah.
5373210	5373290	Yeah.
5374810	5378071	and then we had our Spoonie Bards in Final Fantasy 2-4.
5378492	5381453	Our beloved boldlerized translations.
5382033	5384994	It's actually evident in a few places in Earthbound.
5385415	5395639	You know, there's a sequence fairly close to the beginning where they replaced a, you know, beating sound with a scolding sound and, you know, that's, you know, your nemesis, basically.
5395679	5401161	He comes home and he gets his ass whipped by his parents, thus, you know, launching into the game proper, I think.
5401602	5401902	Mm-hmm.
5403622	5406764	Well, the game did not sell very well when it was new.
5407684	5421811	However, everyone loved it because they really liked the satire of American culture and the different parodies showing up for the RPG genre.
5422451	5425073	It's so quintessentially Japanese.
5425213	5428254	I mean, there's just something so unique about it.
5428314	5431916	You could not have something like Mr. Saturn in an American game.
5433160	5433581	That's true.
5434302	5439088	I like Mr. Saturn in Smash Brothers because you can hit people with him.
5439949	5440890	Or the cultist.
5440930	5442432	That was my favorite part of the game.
5442473	5442773	Ah, yes.
5442833	5443374	Oh my god.
5443854	5444996	That shit was hilarious.
5445537	5446898	Or a boss made out of vomit.
5447259	5447519	I mean...
5448800	5451582	I do like running around in your pajamas, but in the original, you were naked.
5451882	5452223	Oh, yes.
5452843	5456465	And it's just such a unique game.
5456585	5458507	That's one of the things that drew me toward it.
5460728	5468853	They had a sequel planned for the Nintendo 64DD, which was Earthbound 64, and it had been in development for a while before it was cancelled.
5469434	5473296	And then it came out as a GBA game called Mother 3.
5473596	5474617	It only came out in Japan.
5475077	5483462	However, there are fan translations, and it does have a very loose connection to Mother 2, but you can play it on its own.
5484162	5485523	There's actually a few returning characters.
5486143	5491766	Yes, and you know, playing the prequel to it does make for a much richer experience.
5491866	5494267	It will punch you in the emotions, I assure you.
5495068	5495988	It'll get you in the feels.
5496268	5496508	Yes.
5497789	5503454	Now, it actually uses a kind of different sort of projection for playing the game.
5503534	5513581	It uses what's called oblique projection instead of the top-down, so that you're sort of skewed on a different level with all of the things around it.
5514642	5525070	So it gives the world, even though it is purely 2D, it gives it some sort of... It really makes it seamless as you go from place to place.
5525510	5529833	You know, I think Pokemon uses kind of a similar... Pretty similar, yeah, style.
5530994	5538760	But I really liked its use of the color palette on the SNES, because I thought it was just gorgeous.
5539081	5539881	Oh, yes, yes.
5540922	5543504	It's not just color, it's how they use it.
5543524	5547527	It also doesn't use random encounters like the first Mother game did.
5547787	5548968	Oh, yeah.
5549209	5552191	And it is not every three steps like the original Mother.
5552891	5553051	Yes.
5554132	5560054	Um, so basically, you know, you beat them down to zero, they, you know, for their hit points, they get killed.
5560454	5564275	And if you defeat a specific type of enemy, there's a chance you'll get an item.
5564935	5567776	Also, my favorite part about it was the rolling counter.
5568216	5572617	You, you know, you could get mortally hit and still finish a fight and live.
5573237	5580199	So if you gave yourself enough time, especially towards the end when you're, you know, upwards of 300 life, you know, that was pretty sweet.
5582019	5586321	I like how it compares your hit points box to an odometer.
5587141	5594523	And then of course you had your psi attacks that used your psychic points.
5596464	5597644	I guess PK fire.
5599806	5602429	I heard that way too many times playing Smash Bros.
5602710	5603431	PK Fire!
5603551	5604192	PK Fire!
5616429	5619492	And except for one character named Pooh, who can use a sword.
5620473	5621794	But that was only way at the end.
5621854	5625177	Towards, you know, for most of the game, he's just using his fists.
5625217	5626718	And this is like, what, a 12-year-old?
5627178	5628740	Yeah, give him props for that.
5630001	5631162	Well, when you're fighting, vomit.
5632763	5635085	And miniaturized UFOs wearing bows and...
5636354	5637494	Yes, all sorts of critters.
5637934	5639935	You had all kinds of neat places in the game, too.
5639955	5647137	You had Onet, you know, Tucson, Threed, Foreside, you know, they were named.
5647297	5655139	You also had Winters, Summers, and Dalam, Scaraba, you know, different places that were meant to mimic different areas.
5655199	5656340	Highly creative names.
5656460	5656800	Yeah.
5660223	5663526	And then you had to beat the Starmen and everything.
5664307	5667130	What I really like is looking at the concept art for this game.
5667751	5669973	I don't know if you've ever seen any of the concept art for this.
5670093	5672555	It's quite whimsical and just making it beautiful.
5672596	5674658	It makes me think of a child's storybook.
5675018	5675899	Oh yes, especially.
5675919	5677661	This would be a fucked up story.
5679342	5685345	My favorite was always Dungeon Man because you could see this really whimsical turn to it.
5685885	5687886	There's so much detail in it and so much life.
5688006	5690527	This is such a life-affirming game.
5690667	5692888	That's one reason I always went back to it.
5696890	5701452	Part of the dialogue for the final battle in this was actually...
5703392	5708617	I was reading, because this is something that I'd read before, about the military policemen and the dismembered beauty.
5709158	5721369	Yes, and it's not actually a rape scene, as is often misquoted, but it's a sex scene which turns into a murder scene, which, you know, is not, it's not really a point for splitting many hairs, but...
5721989	5728658	But Itoi said that it had such an impact on him that he incorporated it into the game.
5728759	5730541	Yeah, and it works really well.
5730601	5736970	It's very disjointed and it's kind of horrifying because there's just this sense of out-of-placeness there that you don't get in many games.
5737350	5744075	I like that when they marketed this in Japan, they actually used a member of SMOP to advertise the game.
5745235	5748337	They had scratches of stickers that came out with it.
5748377	5753141	They did all kinds of stuff with Weekly Famitsu to promote the hell out of this game.
5753181	5755662	And of course, sadly, it didn't sell up to expectations.
5756303	5763928	But in America, it sold 140,000 copies and twice that many in Japan, which is still not all that great.
5764008	5765969	Not for how SNES games were selling at the time.
5767730	5770632	You know, it's like many things that are underappreciated when they're new.
5771312	5773113	They go back and get that cult status.
5773533	5773873	Oh, yes.
5774774	5778896	And now, you know, it's just considered one of the top games ever.
5780137	5784939	In 2006, there was a pull in Famitsu and it was rated the 37th best game of all time out of 100.
5784999	5791963	And it was listed from Gamasutra as one of the top 20 essential Japanese RPGs.
5793041	5800950	I really love this game for the record because, you know, and I remember playing this, I rented this at least like four times from the store and stuff like that, just playing the shit out of it.
5802932	5812663	One reason I really liked it is that, you know, I was really into Final Fantasy and all those games on Super Nintendo and this was very kind of, it was like that, but very, like it wasn't swords and sorcery and stuff, it was just like...
5813183	5815324	Kids being stupid, and I loved that.
5815524	5822986	Like, it was very cartoonish, like the most cartoony thing you could really play on the Super Nintendo at the time, but yet it was like this Final Fantasy RPG.
5823406	5824707	That's what I always really loved about it.
5825227	5827147	I really should break out my copy again and play it.
5827327	5827808	Good times.
5828568	5832049	But, yeah, I actually have, I believe this is one of the ones I have in the box.
5833009	5835850	I have to admit, I came into this afterwards.
5836150	5837851	This was not one of the ones we had on the console.
5837871	5843132	I actually completed this on emulator, so sorry if that disqualifies me as a serious gamer.
5843472	5846513	I think a lot of people at this point have discovered it that way.
5846533	5848654	It's really hard to find it for less than $60.
5850314	5867763	But at the same time, I feel kind of glad that it's found such popularity on an emulator because it has reached a much wider audience and it does make for a richer experience that you can get it out to different people and you find all these little secrets and things you hadn't seen before.
5867803	5868763	Did you see the embryos?
5870174	5873259	You know, in the very last stage... I've seen that, yeah, but you know what?
5873339	5875021	I don't think that is intentional.
5875061	5876904	Like, I don't think that's an intentional design thing.
5876924	5881931	That's a bit like, you know, the backwards tribute to Satan in a Led Zeppelin song.
5881972	5884936	Yeah, but I could... But given Itoi's...
5886599	5887060	History?
5887420	5889423	Maybe I could see it happening.
5889604	5891887	I just don't know how you intentionally get that.
5892147	5894390	Because it's not just one static image.
5894451	5896413	It's sort of a rolling thing.
5896514	5897074	It's a tile.
5898476	5899838	But it's moving.
5900319	5901160	So I don't know.
5903354	5916727	I mean, at any rate, for other things that have happened with the series, of course, definitely Ness and other characters have shown up in the Super Smash Bros.
5916767	5917167	series.
5919389	5922172	Well, Ness was a hidden character, but everyone freaking used him.
5922812	5933659	and, um, Onet was actually a stage in Brawl and New Pork City in Mother 3 showed up in Brawl as well with the Chimera to the rejoice of all who wanted to see it in 3D.
5934060	5934280	Yes.
5935241	5942645	Um, there were also trophies for Paula, Jeff, and Pooh and, um, Jeff is an assist trophy in Super Smash Bros.
5942686	5952232	Brawl and, uh, his, uh, multi-bottle rockets were involved as well and Mr. Saturn, you could throw him at people because that was awesome.
5953232	5955913	Um, why was, Mr. Saturn should have been our Pikachu.
5956653	5966996	Mr. Saturn, however, you got special, um, it was like, you got an achievement for Mr. Saturn love, or you got points for it, when you let him wander around the screen and didn't throw him at people.
5968236	5969017	I always thought it was funny.
5969297	5970817	And Mr. Saturn only wants to help.
5971437	5974178	You can't help it that he's just a butt on legs, with a bow.
5975258	5976039	A butt on, yeah.
5977279	5988023	Well, at any rate, like I said earlier, there was supposed to be a sequel in 96 on the 64DD, but it kept having production problems and didn't show at E3 and other gaming conventions.
5988443	5996466	So Nintendo cancelled it on August 21st, 2000, but it resurfaced as a GBA title and it was only released in Japan.
5997106	6001208	And also Itoi said he had no more plans to develop the series any further.
6002328	6008116	There was an ESRB rating that said that it might come out on Wii but there are still no official plans.
6009306	6021651	And I want to give further props to the fan translation community because in their fight to translate this, they also found a lot of cool, like, kind of unused things.
6022172	6025593	You know, just sort of, you know, artifacts that were left in the data.
6026013	6026193	Yes.
6026354	6027554	Well, unfortunately, no.
6027654	6038259	Just things that, you know, unused bosses and unused sprites that just, they make you wonder at how, you know, what was originally planned for this because, you know, there were a few places...
6039619	6043721	The creator said he actually had to scale it back a bit because it was frightening him.
6044341	6049983	I'm of course referring to the extended mushroom trip, like sort of halfway through the game.
6050043	6054324	I actually need to sit down and play level 3 because I just haven't had time.
6054564	6058125	Well, there's an extended mushroom trip and the final boss.
6058145	6059386	I like extended mushroom trips.
6059446	6064808	The final boss, there is an unused boss battle, which I think it's available on YouTube, which...
6066068	6070090	is deeply unsettling, despite my lack of understanding Japanese.
6071031	6077954	But as it stands, the Mother 3 game is a very emotionally engaging and rich game, I find.
6078414	6084297	It's got its predecessor's balance of horror and just awesomeness.
6085618	6088079	Well, this also I think is kind of cool.
6088299	6097083	The sound designer for Earthbound, Keiichi Suzuki, he actually said that the biggest influence for the music for him was John Lennon.
6097904	6098304	Excellent.
6098800	6101801	You know, in the YouTube we're watching here, I just saw a reference to the Beatles.
6102161	6103602	And it's like one of those funny little jokes.
6103642	6107043	Like, do you know the name of this Beatles song?
6107603	6109203	Blank, blank, blank, today.
6109664	6111364	And your options are yes and no.
6111484	6114105	Like, it's a funny joke because you can say yes.
6114605	6115005	You're right.
6115105	6115766	It's yesterday.
6115786	6116626	Anyway.
6116986	6122568	And, you know, music references, sadly, are one of the reasons they'd have trouble releasing Mother 3 in the U.S.
6123309	6127831	Because there is the Runaway 5 in Earthbound.
6128151	6133833	It was actually originally kind of a Blues Brother-y tribute, which it's kind of evident in the finished product of the game.
6133913	6138495	But I can't remember, it's the DMC or something like that?
6138975	6139456	There's Pinball.
6139476	6140016	I just called Pinball.
6140056	6140876	I forgot there were Pinball.
6140896	6141837	There's Pinball in the arcade.
6141897	6142237	Sweet.
6143021	6149403	but there's also the band in Mother 3 is also kind of clearly ripped off another band.
6152404	6153345	Well, that's the game.
6154305	6158827	Mother 2 slash Earthbound with strong hints towards Mother 3.
6160387	6162008	Alright, there it is, your classic game of the week.
6162148	6167130	Earthbound, Mother 2 and a little dash of Mother 3 but we have to save that for another week.
6167150	6168450	We should do a Gaiden version called Daddy.
6170612	6172914	Anyhow, that's going to do it for Part A, but don't go anywhere.
6172954	6173996	We have plenty more to come.
6174176	6176779	We may not have a whole lot of news, but we do have the rapid-fire news.
6177139	6184968	We have your Fugo Question of the Week coming up as well, Mailbag, and Match Game coming back tonight in Part B. Don't go anywhere, guys.
6184988	6188292	We'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6194423	6203331	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio, live here on November the 25th of 2012 with the 483rd episode of our show.
6204032	6207836	It's a little bit of a slower news week this week, but that's alright.
6207896	6213581	We still have some news stories to talk about, including the rapid fire news, which is coming up right now.
6213821	6214062	Loki.
6214082	6214462	Loki.
6214782	6214962	Yes.
6215523	6219806	So let's talk about my favorite gaming series, Grand Theft Auto.
6220386	6227471	Grand Theft Auto had a wonderful release on iOS and Android of Grand Theft Auto 3 celebrating the 10th anniversary earlier this year.
6227852	6229353	Maybe even been last year, can't remember.
6230233	6242801	Um, but, soon enough, you'll be able to get some more Grand Theft Auto Love on your portable devices with Grand Theft Auto Vice City, the HD treatment for the 10th anniversary of that game as well.
6243002	6247184	So, I'm hoping that San Andreas is only a couple more years away.
6248025	6257471	And, uh, that'll be available on, um, December 6th, and apparently it's gonna cost you $5 on, uh, both Android or iOS.
6259690	6260971	That's fantastic.
6261391	6262451	I cannot wait.
6263311	6265452	Except I can, because I'm not actually going to play it on the phone.
6266893	6269774	Because gaming on the phone sucks.
6270574	6282359	And then, to kind of go along with that, there's kind of a fan campaign to try to get Grand Theft Auto V onto PC and the Wii U. And, of course, developers are like, well, they're...
6282779	6302374	anything is up for consideration of course they haven't announced anything and um you know right now they're mainly focused on getting the game out on you know the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 it's hard to say if there's actually going to be a PC version for the game seeing as that you know there wasn't one for Red Dead Redemption although there was one for L.A.
6302394	6307878	Noire so it's I don't know it'd be kind of cool if it was on PC because that game looks fantastic and
6310498	6311058	Bayonetta DLC Japan
6340757	6363138	is coming to North America however it's coming to North America as a GameStop exclusive and I guess it will be kind of a day one limited edition also in Europe the US you're going to have to wait until you know comes out in January and if you really want that DLC you're going to have to wait until you know wait and purchase it from GameStop
6364139	6365660	And the game is supposed to be a lot cheaper.
6365700	6368543	It's only $29.99 as opposed to a full price game.
6369724	6374788	It is kind of disappointing though that GameStop locked in the DLC for that.
6375368	6375969	I hate that.
6376629	6376949	Whatever.
6377009	6377670	I mean, never know.
6377710	6378991	That stuff could come out later on.
6379031	6379912	They could sell it later.
6380312	6386617	But just, you know, throwing GameStop a bone, I guess, and giving them exclusive DLC.
6387038	6387918	Not going to hold my breath.
6388659	6388779	Yeah.
6390515	6391635	All right, well, moving on.
6392156	6392876	This is pretty good.
6392936	6397158	I mean, I know we've talked about some Vita hardships, but there's a lot of good stuff to talk about on Vita right now.
6397258	6399599	Not just the free games, but price reductions.
6400219	6405681	November 27th is going to see some price reductions on the PlayStation Network for the download.
6405701	6411143	You know, if you have a memory card large enough to hold some games, you can get some games for a lot cheaper than they used to be for $17.99.
6413384	6420829	Hot Shots Golf, Little Deviants, MLB 12 The Show, Mod Nation Racers, Reality Fighters, and Wipeout 2048.
6421430	6426173	$26.99, Resistance Burning Skies, Smart Ass, not to be confused with Smart Ass, and Unit 13.
6426713	6433338	And then $35.99 for Uncharted Golden Abyss, but as mentioned before, you could get that free with PlayStation Plus.
6433358	6440403	You would just have to kind of juggle like, you know, remember when you are on PlayStation Plus, if you let your account lapse, you'll lose all those free games.
6440803	6443825	So you kind of have to weigh, is that something I really want to be locked into?
6444086	6451711	I don't mind it, personally, because the games I'm getting for free aren't things that, like, if I really want a game bad enough that I can revisit whenever, I'll buy it.
6452772	6457515	But I like that PlayStation Plus kind of allows me to play games I might have missed from a couple years ago.
6457715	6458756	So, I don't know.
6458876	6465181	I don't want to sound like a mouthpiece for Sony, but I'm glad to see that they're reducing the price of some of these games.
6466001	6467402	Might be what the system needs right now.
6468803	6497140	Darkstalker Resurrection Some folks looking forward to this This is the Darkstalker games for Xbox Live and Playstation Network There's also going to be a new tournament and online tournament mode coming in the game This is according to Capcom Unity The online mode is going to support 8 players Sudden Death, One Takes All, Best of 2 or Best of 3 Resurrection will also include the usual ranked and player matches Resurrection of course being the name of this download game
6498301	6498921	Pretty cool there.
6499201	6503565	And you can do replays on YouTube, so can't wait for YouTube to get flooded with this stuff.
6504505	6505186	So that's pretty cool.
6505206	6510430	$14.99 on PlayStation Network, 1,200 Microsoft points on Xbox Live Arcade when it comes out in 2013.
6511731	6515834	If you're a fan of Half Minute Hero, maybe you're wondering when are we getting Half Minute Hero 2?
6516895	6521919	Well, marvelous producer Esteban Salazar told Siliconera that...
6522339	6529701	quote, it's considerably more expensive to put out the sequel, and they need to sell a lot more of the first game on PC to begin to justify it.
6530782	6536343	If this is something you're interested in, you might want to quote, encourage your friends to buy the Steam version, or buy it for them.
6537264	6539604	P.S., the game's 40% off on Steam right now.
6539885	6543126	Actually, that wasn't in the quote, but that sure seemed to be convenient.
6543706	6545506	So, yep, you want Half Minute Hero 2?
6546367	6547887	Buy Part 1 for friends.
6548767	6549848	Half Minute Hero was kind of fun.
6551843	6557071	I mean, I'm not going to cry if the sequel never comes out, but I'm surprised it didn't sell enough to necessitate the sequel.
6557812	6558333	DarkSakura.
6559274	6559875	Stuff happened.
6559915	6560156	The end.
6560176	6560676	No, I'm kidding.
6561918	6563541	For fans of the...
6566781	6582948	of the AM2 games they are going to be out on Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network during the week we have Fighting Vipers Sonic the Fighters which I'm more excited about and Virtua Fighter 2 which I could give less than a crap about but I'm usually very alone in that
6584429	6588451	The games are going to have their own achievements and trophies and will support online multiplayer.
6589071	6599697	They will be about five bucks each and about 4.49 euro in Europe.
6599877	6604860	So they'll be out on November 27th in North America and December 5th in Europe.
6607003	6610366	Man, I have Fighter's Megamix at home.
6611067	6615831	And I wish that they would update Fighter's Megamix.
6615851	6616491	Wouldn't that be awesome?
6617652	6622236	So anyway, Capcom's also getting back into more fighting game stuff.
6622296	6625599	They've registered the name Fighters of Capcom.
6625719	6626820	It's a trademark, actually.
6627661	6631985	And they haven't really said what it's about, but...
6633524	6634424	Maybe it'll be good.
6635245	6635665	Hopefully.
6636845	6647210	And moving forward, on the Korean ratings board, Resident Evil Revelations has been listed for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
6647910	6652592	So that means we might actually be getting the version out for the bigger consoles.
6652892	6653212	Who knows?
6654373	6654973	And that is that.
6656153	6656453	All right.
6656934	6659795	Let's take a trip over to Facebook and Google+.
6659995	6662436	And when you slam those words together, you get Boogle.
6669966	6671067	The Google Question of the Week.
6671107	6675210	We ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities and look for some answers.
6675891	6679974	And, of course, it's got to be about the Wii U again this week, but with good reason.
6680835	6688661	This is about kind of how we're feeling post-launch of the Wii U. Here's the question from our Facebook community at Facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio and our Google Plus community.
6688681	6689621	Search for Orange Launch Radio.
6690482	6698526	Now that the console has been out for a week, have you found that your opinion has changed on the Wii U from the pre-release hype?
6698786	6702767	Perhaps you weren't so excited about it before, but you ended up buying one for a reason.
6703308	6707370	Or you were really excited after E3, but found that maybe it'll hold off for a while.
6707470	6709550	Why did or didn't your opinion change?
6710491	6712572	Let's go to some comments first off from Facebook.
6713706	6714907	Wicked said, Wow, I was wrong.
6734554	6739976	The graphics are definitely top notch and the Wii's usual stigma of waggle wand was significantly downplayed.
6740336	6745298	The games are amazing, especially Zombie U and Nintendo Land which could easily be the party game of the year.
6745778	6754021	As lukewarm as I was for the Wii U, I must say after having it in my hands, which the tablet controller feels perfectly fine in, I am definitely on the bandwagon now.
6755301	6760126	VirtualPhil said I was excited for it but also a bit meh regarding the annoying hype.
6760547	6766713	However, now that I've played the console and have had a ton of fun with Nintendo Land's multiplayer games, I'm loving it.
6767093	6769535	I just wish the catalog of games was bigger from the outset.
6770456	6771337	DarkCharger said,
6791747	6796930	Doug T said, I'm holding off on buying the Wii U. I'm waiting for more high-quality first-party games.
6797110	6802773	I have a PS3, which is my favorite console, so when games are released on all three consoles, I'll buy it for my PS3.
6803313	6807415	Also, I was disappointed with my Wii, so I'm waiting to see how the Wii U does over time.
6808615	6813658	AZHP said, before the console launched, I was really hopeful that Nintendo had figured out online.
6814178	6815699	Pause for Loki to scoff.
6817810	6819651	They figured out that it's there.
6820911	6821831	How to use it, maybe.
6822431	6836235	Now that I'm hearing reports of how purchases are tied to the console instead of the Mii profile, that there are separate wallets for Wii and Wii U online purchases that are on the same console, and that profiles can't be transferred between consoles, I'm just disappointed in Nintendo.
6836756	6839916	The 360 did online right, and they did it seven years ago.
6840137	6841017	Shame on Nintendo.
6842638	6852225	This answer is a little lengthy from Degenerate Johnny, so I'm not going to read the whole thing, but basically said, you know, when Reggie said that they're going to cater to hardcore gamers, he was very excited.
6852606	6859972	Now that it's launched, my anticipation dropped considerably, partially because the console lacks focus on achievement and trophy system.
6861007	6863028	Nintendo did this for the benefit of the developers.
6864048	6868770	And he kind of goes on to talk about how it's like a standard thing now, how Blizzard and all this does this.
6869731	6878275	I'm kind of disappointed they missed the boat on that too, especially because, you know, on the 3DS, they have the whole accomplishments thing in the plaza.
6878415	6880355	I thought they were going this direction.
6880916	6882296	You know, it's... Oops.
6883917	6885298	We're not ready for the mailbag yet.
6885338	6886178	Be quiet, music.
6887639	6888159	Sorry about that.
6888799	6889620	Live radio, it's fun.
6892310	6896293	So yeah, I don't think it's a deal breaker for the system.
6896353	6900196	It's disappointing, but what do you want to bet it's one of those things that just suddenly shows up later?
6901937	6902297	Let's see.
6905347	6915553	I'm looking at some of the comments in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com BlackWolf said, to be fair, Nintendo said that you'll be able to transfer profiles yourself soon and that they can already transfer them if you call them.
6915974	6921857	But yes, it's not there on launch day because obviously we all bought multiple Wii U's and really want to be able to transfer our profiles in the first week.
6922718	6928441	BlackWolf, again, it's the whole they're building it as they go along and how obvious is it?
6928782	6929362	Just saying.
6936181	6946427	Pete Garuno says, I was cautiously optimistic when it was announced, indifferent when more details emerged, but then I tried a demo unit and could see the potential.
6946968	6955493	One of my friends bought it on launch, and seeing the social aspects of sending picture messages, asking other players for help on a specific point is kind of selling it for me.
6956033	6961596	Can't really justify the purchase at the moment though, so it's currently on my wait for a major price reduction pile.
6963336	6969019	Let's see, going to Codeman, I haven't bought one yet, but I've played with one here and they're at different electronic stores.
6969439	6973641	I have to say that the tech is pretty cool and being a designer, the interface is well done as well.
6974141	6979844	What's keeping me from buying it though is I don't believe Nintendo is done with it and tried to rush it out before the holiday season.
6980264	6983966	So until everything is working correctly, I would love to get my hands on one.
6985026	6988230	The only flaw in your logic I see is that, again, it's about the games.
6989151	6994036	It's not necessarily about the hardware or even the firmware that's on said hardware.
6994136	7001425	I mean, if they're writing that as they go along, it's weird, but it's not really a deal breaker if Mario HD is still going to be Mario HD at the end of the day.
7001805	7002306	Think about that.
7002366	7002946	That's all I'm saying.
7004147	7013394	But I can see what he's saying, though, because if you look at the Wii, remember the Wii came out, and then they're all, oh, Motion Plus, because, you know, we really wanted these controllers more sensitive.
7013735	7016217	So now we have Wii Motion Plus, and oh, you bought Motion Plus?
7016657	7017057	You know what?
7017117	7020180	Now we have this fancy controller that already has it incorporated into it.
7020260	7021000	Yay!
7021361	7027045	Oh, wait, now we need this other controller to do something, and you need that for this game, and...
7028346	7028946	That's fair.
7029166	7029566	That's fair.
7029986	7030667	I understand that.
7030707	7033067	The whole Wii Motion Plus or the Vitality Sensor.
7033167	7033547	Ooh.
7034407	7034687	LOL.
7035247	7036188	Okay, Google Plus time.
7036988	7039908	Evil says, Hype level has generally been the same.
7040168	7042629	Actually, it's E3VL, but it says evil to me.
7043129	7044829	Hype level has been generally the same.
7045610	7048530	Nintendo's consoles will always be my go-to for first-party content.
7048670	7056732	My only concern is that if the Wii U will be my main console after Microsoft and Sony releases their next system, seeing if Nintendo is consistent with quality of third-party ports.
7057632	7059473	Redertainment says, My opinion has not changed.
7059833	7065494	I still have priorities that are higher on my list than buying a Wii U. It's not that I think a Wii U would be a good buy or a bad buy.
7065835	7067555	I'd just rather save for a house right now.
7067895	7069316	I don't think I'm alone in this opinion.
7069936	7070896	Priorities are important.
7070956	7071396	I'll give you that.
7072317	7076798	Rabababa says, Now that I've played it a few days, the pad is better than expected.
7076958	7078258	It can do a lot of unique things.
7078398	7081159	Best of all, I can look up hints on the internet without an extra device.
7081659	7083200	Very few games take advantage of it.
7084059	7088100	Flaco Jones says, I got a chance to play it for a few hours and my opinion hasn't changed much.
7088620	7095722	I still think it's way overpriced when comparing it to the competition and the controller didn't sway me with the small selection of games that utilize it halfway decently.
7096222	7098963	Better games would definitely be the best way to change my mind.
7099823	7102443	Sean F replied and said, I was never really excited.
7102703	7104424	My PS3 and PSP are enough for me.
7105164	7111405	And Nick M said, yeah, it went from being a polished, well-presented turd to just a turd that sits in the corner of my living room.
7112146	7112906	So you bought one?
7113886	7118468	I'd be curious to hear more about you bought one and it's sitting in your living room unused.
7118608	7120329	I want to hear more about that.
7121109	7122370	Please elaborate for later.
7123130	7125111	And I want to hear about your collection of polished turds.
7125131	7125551	No, I'm kidding.
7126812	7130814	I haven't heard of anybody who's bought one that said, yeah, it's already collecting dust in the corner.
7132595	7135657	I'm very curious to explore that further, so please send an email or something.
7135957	7140301	It's very possible it collected fingerprints, because I'm sure it can collect fingerprints quite well.
7140481	7142122	Yeah, it does.
7142142	7142983	Especially the black ones.
7143263	7145825	Alright, I read all the comments tonight, because I'm nice.
7146845	7150606	Code Band is in chat, by the way, to kind of clarify the comment.
7150666	7157468	I really want to check out Zombie U. And I do agree it's about the games, Rob, but I do think they should get the console under control before a good title can be released.
7157948	7161309	In light of what Loki said, I get a little more what you're saying now.
7162050	7162290	All right.
7162310	7165671	A couple of stories for you guys, and then we're going to get to the match game.
7165711	7166131	Yay!
7167574	7167874	THQ PR Guys
7186895	7192317	They've been trying to cover up, well, cover up, I guess, defuse a situation that happened on Twitter.
7193697	7194537	I think it was on Twitter.
7195137	7196558	Anyways, during an interview.
7196578	7198118	It's always Twitter.
7198538	7200279	Take away people's PR, people.
7201499	7202919	And, like, they say the dumbest shit.
7202979	7204300	That's why Twitter is great.
7205160	7205520	Honestly.
7206481	7208682	So I think at least part of it took place on Twitter.
7208842	7213705	It's basically talking about how the Wii U's CPU is slow.
7214625	7218647	And the quote is actually, the Wii U has a horrible, slow CPU.
7219167	7229513	And that's why they're saying that Metro Last Light is not going to be ported to the Wii U is because the game system has a slow CPU and that it would just be impossible.
7230633	7230893	So...
7232478	7245261	Of course, THQ doesn't want to have this whole stigma of, oh, yeah, we just totally dogged in that system, but we want to put some games out on it and have Nintendo go, yeah, fuck you guys.
7246082	7247262	You're not going on our system.
7248262	7253324	But if you think about it, THQ doesn't have a whole ton of... I mean, they have a few games, I guess, that were launched.
7253344	7256604	There was Darksiders 2 and...
7259205	7272721	they it's not out yet but they've got Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy that they're porting over to that not necessarily CPU intensive games I mean Darksiders maybe a little bit but you know Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune not quite so much um
7274222	7289830	So, I don't know, it's interesting though, they have basically the developer saying one thing and then THQ's kind of like saying, oh, well, it's not necessarily what they meant, they're just saying that, oh, it's a very CPU intensive game and, you know, that...
7291070	7295833	I don't know, maybe that this, you know, Wii U CPU wouldn't be able to handle this or something.
7296233	7309600	And then there's some other developers saying, well, you know, sounds like, you know, they just couldn't even bother, you know, trying to port the game system, you know, port over because it does have a faster GPU and a lot more RAM than the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360.
7310801	7314643	And of course, you know, it's this Gustav Holling thing.
7315043	7317545	saying, oh, yeah, you know, GPU and RAM's nice.
7317605	7320466	I have shaders and textures loaded, but physics and gameplay run CPU.
7320486	7321507	So, I don't know.
7322127	7323168	Will that be a problem?
7323829	7324429	Possibly.
7324709	7325029	I don't know.
7325069	7335636	It'd be interesting to see if we get, you know, if Grand Theft Auto V doesn't come to the Wii U because it's got a slow CPU and can't load, you know, can't load the world fast enough or something like that.
7336451	7343895	TigerClaw with a fair thought in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com Maybe the Wii U having a better GPU and a slow CPU is a trade-off.
7344275	7353820	Nintendo wanted a system with really great graphics, but had to sacrifice CPU in order to bring the cost of the system down, which is why some games like Arkham City have frame rate drops.
7354941	7356401	That's not good.
7356782	7361024	I mean, I understand that if you're going to make sacrifices, then you're not ready.
7361324	7365186	Then you need to wait until that tech comes down in price.
7365966	7367887	and maybe one of the consoles will be more finished.
7368367	7376049	But that's going to be a problem because if you're not willing to put the technology into it, you're going to have these next-gen systems come out and they're just going to run circles around you.
7376449	7382911	Yeah, and the frame rate drop in Arkham City, I'm chalking that up to the fact that it's a port of a game that wasn't designed for the console.
7383351	7385992	I'm really curious what 2013's games are going to look like.
7386052	7388233	That's really what's going to define the Wii U, honestly.
7388433	7390114	And I'm sure the first party games will look nice.
7390154	7392055	That's what they've always kind of based their sales off of.
7392075	7393396	That's what always happens for Nintendo.
7393636	7404063	So, I mean, that'll look nice because they're developing for the system, but you're going to have to wonder with some of these game systems that are already out there now, and you're going to have a Wii U version coming out at the same time.
7404663	7413969	and honestly, for me, it seems like it's like, okay, Nintendo told these publishers, hey, by the way, you gotta have this gimmick that's thrown in there.
7414009	7422894	Like, for example, NBA 2K13, you can hold up the Wii U's gamepad to see which of your athletes or whatever are tired.
7424395	7425035	Thank you for watching!
7443766	7444887	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7467848	7468589	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7490628	7517151	going to our chat room with some comments at live.vognetwork.com Ranma says I'm waiting for Mario Kart and Bayonetta 2 and Dungeon Buster says I'm mostly waiting on Bayonetta 2 Ranma says by the way I feel bad for people eBaying Wii U's it's pointless don't feel bad for them point and laugh at them I think it's hilarious that that whole scheme is backfiring because those people that are buying consoles just to flip them and take them away from somebody who might really want them fuck them I hope they lose a lot of money
7518672	7546829	I hope they get stuck with all those Twinkies too and have to eat them so you know what I feel no sympathy for them unless it was like legitimately bought and maybe being flipped around because a person decided well I don't want this polished turd sitting in the corner of my room anymore that's different like a used Wii U already or whatever but like somebody who bought it just to try and flip it for an increased cost middle finger to you I don't care that you're out $400 they'll take them back to the store and get their money back which is also bullshit but you know it is what it is
7547972	7575579	anyhow uh piggybacking on this a little bit there's a piece in the New York Times that is kind of a like it's in the New York Times it's not really an opinion article but it certainly kind of kind of looks at is did Nintendo do the right thing is the Wii U a good system and they go to a familiar name for a quote which you know this little quote from the New York Times article is making its way around the game blogs and the quote is from Nolan Bushnell you recognize that name yep yeah what did he do Jamie
7577026	7578128	and Chuck E. Cheese.
7578688	7580490	Yes, and Pond too.
7580691	7581391	Yes, and Chuck E. Cheese.
7581411	7582092	That's important too.
7582613	7587539	Well, quote, I actually am baffled by it.
7588300	7589962	I don't think it's going to be a big success.
7591857	7592478	That's the quote.
7592898	7593218	Let's see.
7593819	7594680	What else did he say here?
7594960	7600306	Quote, these things will continue to sputter along, but I really don't think they'll be of major import ever again.
7600767	7602689	It feels like the end of an era to me.
7602709	7608214	And, of course, that has all the game blogs going, Nolan Bushnell thinks the Wii U is the end of an era, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
7609315	7634232	and the the it's important to note that this article also kind of takes the stance of uh that mobile it's it's another one of those pieces that say mobile gaming is going to kill it all and and you know Nintendo's just trying to get into tablet gaming with this and so I don't know how I feel about all this but it is interesting that Nolan Bushnell kind of throws his two cents out there granted it's one small quote out of what I hope was a larger interview but um
7635072	7636573	Is it the end of an era?
7637074	7640856	Is the Wii U the swan song of console gaming as we know it?
7641497	7642417	I hardly think so.
7644038	7645239	It's just stupid.
7646140	7653885	Once again, you're kind of assuming that everyone's going to buy into it or not going to buy into it and go, Oh no, what am I going to game on now?
7654306	7659229	I just don't understand why everyone thinks if these next-gen consoles fail that the whole industry is going to fail.
7659529	7661451	Hey, you have some consoles that still work.
7661471	7663152	You know what happens if a console fails?
7663692	7663993	Guess what?
7664013	7665755	They just make games for other consoles.
7666075	7666716	Just like the Vita.
7666917	7668519	If the Vita fails, guess what?
7668539	7670642	They'll just make games for the 3DS and the DS.
7671628	7679633	Black Wolf kind of puts Nolan's words in another light here, saying, no more TV gaming, all going handheld mobile now.
7679753	7680993	That's what Nolan thinks.
7681414	7684395	More people play mobile games than ever played console games.
7684755	7693200	So maybe he's thinking, maybe Nolan is going this way because of the Wii U invoking the tablet thing, kind of trying to get that piece of mobile game.
7693240	7694081	But for me, like...
7695061	7702108	The part that people miss when they jump to that conclusion is that they're not putting I mean, the Wii U kind of can't do those same tablet games.
7702228	7706032	It really is a second screen that does have limited touch controls.
7706132	7707613	It just means you can play while you pee.
7709775	7711797	I guarantee there's going to be DS Virtual Console games by next year.
7739745	7763228	oh oh with the whole yeah because since there is second screen anyway and why not screen is set up exactly like a ds why not i think clearly it all indicates a return to animatronic restaurants uh blackwell following up saying well what he's saying is that the new console isn't selling out so people have stopped buying new game consoles i think it is actually selling now it's just they're replenishing a lot faster
7763328	7786516	and Nintendo's also not advertising it because maybe you know and there's a lot of theories behind that but you know maybe to their benefit they know they're going to be limited so why I mean the people that want to buy them already know about it so why have that advertising push behind it let that grow a little more organically and then do the big advertising push in January February when when you need it spend your gift card on a Wii U you know that that stuff
7790215	7794037	BlackWolf continuing on trying to push the points here.
7794718	7799261	But Cut the Rope and Angry Birds are the games that majority of game buyers want to play.
7799661	7800862	We're the minority now.
7803864	7812651	Yes and no to me because I feel like the majority audience that's buying Cut the Rope and Angry Birds is an audience that didn't exist before.
7813531	7818035	Did people really switch from console gaming to exclusive mobile gaming?
7819110	7820933	I don't really think that's what happened
7835976	7847805	So, yeah, I can understand that, okay, that's where a lot of money is at and so forth, but the console industry has been afloat for the years since 1978 with, say, the video game crash of 83, 84.
7849046	7851208	The video game industry has been afloat without that audience.
7852825	7853806	So I don't know.
7854587	7854847	Anyhow.
7855588	7855849	All right.
7856569	7857150	Let's move on.
7859253	7862717	Bojikawa wants to say, I keep hearing that the Wii U hasn't been advertised.
7863037	7865159	I don't watch TV, but I do watch Hulu.
7865480	7868583	I've seen the commercial for the Wii U many times there the last couple weeks.
7869444	7872707	It's also your audience that's most likely to be aware of things like that.
7872967	7875108	That's still targeting your tech crowd.
7875749	7879852	There's a big difference between running Wii U commercials there and running Wii U commercials on Saturday morning cartoons.
7880432	7881713	But anyway, I digress.
7882534	7883815	Let's play some Match Game.
7884035	7885096	We need to do Match Game.
7886317	7888198	We haven't done Match Game in forever on this show.
7891540	7891821	All right.
7892401	7896044	If you want to play Match Game in our chat room...
7896949	7897690	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7923228	7923708	Hi.
7924809	7927389	Also joining us for the Match Game tonight is Tech Master Loki.
7927910	7928230	Hi.
7929070	7931291	And I'm going to be joining you for the Match Game tonight.
7931331	7931971	Woo-hoo.
7932731	7937753	Also joining us for the Match Game tonight, say hello to, it's your first time on the show, be gentle, Rachel.
7938053	7938453	Howdy.
7938693	7939173	How you doing?
7940134	7941694	Are you here to promote anything tonight?
7941734	7943835	Is there a new movie coming out that you need to promote?
7944715	7945235	Or a book?
7945836	7946516	Quick blog plug.
7947196	7947676	Yeah, sure.
7948536	7950457	Greetings at the Wasteland at WordPress.
7951017	7951577	There you go.
7951737	7952897	Greetings from the Wasteland.
7953177	7953717	Sorry.
7954197	7955237	But it doesn't stop there.
7955277	7959198	We have one more person playing match game with us tonight.
7959538	7961278	Say hello, everybody, to Alan.
7961739	7963119	Raspberries.
7964359	7965159	How are you doing, Alan?
7965959	7966259	Good.
7966679	7970180	Is there anything... Are you doing your Carol Channing for us tonight?
7970240	7972760	Is that what you're going to do match game as?
7972940	7974381	No, I'm fine.
7974441	7975781	Do you have anything you want to promote tonight?
7978530	7980051	Do you want to promote Fabulous Flame?
7980451	7981592	Oh, I'm really sorry about that.
7982813	7984874	I want to promote new internet.
7985495	7986736	It's not dropping out.
7987396	7988537	Yeah, apparently it's doing pretty well.
7988877	7990038	So, hooray to that.
7990418	7992540	All right, we're going to open up the Skype line.
7992920	7995942	Remember, we're going to have one contestant in the chat room, one on the Skype line.
7996302	7999424	If you want to play a match game, call us on the Skype line right now.
7999584	8001706	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
8002346	8004628	or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8004668	8007370	So we're going to pick one person on the phones and another from our chat room.
8008190	8010352	It looks like we have a few correct answers right now.
8010872	8012433	So again, 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8012473	8015195	Use name in Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8015616	8021940	While we wait for that call, because there is a little bit of a delay still, and I think the delay got longer because of our setup, but that's okay.
8021980	8024502	I'd rather it be a longer delay and not drop out as much.
8026503	8029806	So anyhow, what I want to... Oh, we got a call coming in.
8029966	8030126	Let's...
8031437	8031837	Let's see.
8033337	8034318	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
8034338	8034718	Who's this?
8035698	8037178	Hey, this is SSJ100 Matt.
8037218	8038458	Hey, SSJ100 Matt.
8038478	8039078	How you doing?
8039198	8039758	Hi.
8039938	8040579	I'm good.
8040719	8042339	I feel like I haven't heard from you in a while.
8042719	8044159	You did all right through Sandy and all that?
8045319	8045959	I did, actually.
8046160	8046620	Good, good.
8046660	8047280	I'm glad to hear it.
8047520	8049360	Well, are you ready to play some match game with us tonight?
8050240	8050740	Hells yeah.
8050920	8051880	Hells yeah.
8052261	8052501	All right.
8052541	8056021	It looks like we have only four people in chat that want to play along.
8056101	8057541	So let's see.
8058162	8060602	Alan, since you can't see chat, pick a number between one and four.
8061903	8062764	Actdeft
8078524	8079264	Actdeft vs. SSJ100Map
8095703	8096423	You get a point.
8096723	8099204	Keep in mind, Actdeft is playing against you in the chat room.
8099444	8103666	He'll be sending his answers over private message and you will be giving yours over the phone.
8103706	8109228	But remember, please do not give your answers until we have a ding from everybody here in the studio.
8109868	8111329	Alright, do you understand the rules, SSJ100 Matt?
8112649	8112949	I do.
8113109	8114511	Alright, that's because you've played before.
8114871	8115651	Alright, yes Alan.
8116072	8122356	I just want to add that we're all really bad at this because I remember the last time we played this and not a single one of us matched shit with anyone.
8123137	8124238	That's the joke.
8126059	8126860	No, it's not.
8127941	8128661	Alright, here we go.
8130002	8133145	Let's get into tonight's first question.
8133705	8134846	Drumroll please.
8134986	8135466	Here we go.
8135546	8136367	Tonight's first question.
8136407	8137448	Four questions tonight.
8139361	8147088	As Space Harrier's biggest fan, Jamie is very excited about Space Harrier coming to the 3DS.
8148189	8161502	She found it odd, though, that in her honor, the designers changed the opening line from Welcome to the Fantasy Zone, get ready, to Welcome to the blank, get ready.
8168977	8173180	Space Harrier's biggest fan, Jamie, is very excited about Space Harrier coming to the 3DS.
8173520	8184508	She found it odd, though, that in her honor, the designers changed the opening line from Welcome to the Fantasy Zone, get ready, to Welcome to the... What the fuck was that?
8184588	8187210	Welcome to the blank, get ready.
8187450	8188931	I'm sorry, you've been beeped.
8190192	8194435	Apparently I got censored by this crappy Think Music MP3, so we'll pause that.
8194856	8197318	Alright, so I'm going to say...
8199022	8199263	Ding.
8199403	8199744	Ding.
8199804	8200145	Ding.
8200325	8201187	Ding, Alan.
8201227	8201448	Ding.
8202169	8202510	Ding.
8202610	8203673	Okay, so we have five.
8204014	8205517	Okay, I see the answer in chat.
8206139	8208083	SSJ100Matt, do you have an answer?
8208123	8208584	I do.
8208605	8209146	Welcome to the...
8210814	8211735	Welcome to the Citadel
8237344	8241333	somebody put that down as the quote of the night because I'm fucking clever Rachel
8242423	8243484	Frenzy from school.
8243684	8244725	How well do we know Jamie?
8244825	8245665	Welcome to the?
8246266	8249908	Wii U. Welcome to the Wii U. Get ready.
8250128	8252310	Wait, what was Actdeft's?
8252670	8253550	Oh, I'm so sorry.
8253691	8255192	Actdeft, I'm not ignoring Actdeft.
8255572	8258214	Actdeft said Garrus Zone.
8258634	8259474	I'm a little rusty.
8259494	8260235	I'm out of practice.
8260255	8261216	We haven't played this in over a year.
8261576	8263397	Welcome to the Garrus Zone.
8263637	8264118	Get ready.
8264178	8266479	So two Mass Effect answers, but a little different there.
8267360	8269161	So we have Welcome to the Citadel and Welcome to the Garrus Zone.
8269441	8271082	All right, Loki, welcome to the?
8271402	8272143	I have Citadel.
8272583	8273364	Did you really?
8273524	8273925	I did.
8274085	8275887	A point for SSJ100Match.
8276107	8276988	Look at that, Alan.
8277329	8278250	Look at that, a point.
8279371	8279771	I have it.
8279811	8281373	It's typed on my screen and everything.
8281553	8282374	All right, there it is.
8283295	8283636	All right.
8284477	8289703	Speaking of Alan, who says that these things always end in a 0-0 tie, welcome to the...
8290302	8291002	Pinkberry.
8291022	8292703	Welcome to the Pinkberry.
8292763	8293663	That was a good answer.
8293683	8294663	I should have said Pinkberry.
8295424	8296284	That is a good answer.
8296324	8297224	Welcome to the Pinkberry.
8297284	8297644	Get ready.
8298084	8302466	And my answer was welcome to the Normandy.
8302866	8303426	Get ready.
8303566	8304927	So close.
8304987	8305467	So close.
8305527	8306407	So close.
8306447	8307047	But you know what?
8307107	8309288	I'm not taking pity because you already got a point.
8309768	8310228	So there it is.
8310448	8312949	The score all in the lead there.
8313069	8314550	SSJ100MAT has one point.
8315110	8316790	Actdeft has zero.
8317791	8318071	All right.
8318131	8318471	Here we go.
8319773	8320714	On to the next question.
8321714	8322575	Question number two.
8322615	8324636	You feeling good about that lead, SSJ100Matt?
8325337	8326698	I'm feeling great.
8326878	8327618	All right, feeling great.
8327658	8329359	Here we go to question number two.
8330941	8345030	THQ might have said that the Wii U has a horrible slow CPU, but Loki is on record saying that the Wii U has a horrible slow blank CPU.
8348615	8358461	THQ might have said that the Wii U has a horrible slow CPU, but Loki is on record saying that the Wii U has a horrible slow blank.
8358481	8362924	I don't know if I can make this small enough.
8371775	8375598	has a horrible slow... I'll do it live!
8377079	8379280	No, you have to write the answer down.
8379681	8385005	Or else Alan's going to come over there and say, he rigged it, he rigged it.
8386826	8388467	Alan is the Mass Effect po-po, you know.
8389068	8389368	Alright.
8390068	8390409	Right, Alan?
8392289	8392589	All right.
8393270	8393770	Okay, here we go.
8393790	8394850	Does that mean he's C-Sec?
8395130	8395750	We have an answer.
8396230	8396490	Shut up.
8396770	8398091	We have an answer from Actdeft.
8398511	8400091	So that means we are ready to go.
8400291	8402172	SJ100 Matt, you have that answer in your mind?
8402312	8402912	Yep, I do.
8402992	8403632	All right, here we go.
8404112	8410494	THQ might have said that the Wii U has a horrible slow CPU, but Loki is on record saying that the Wii U has a horrible slow...
8412122	8414104	Rendering of tits slash boobs.
8414384	8415786	Rendering of boobs.
8416106	8416467	Tits.
8416887	8417367	Okay, good.
8418088	8423374	Actdeft says a horrible, slow maker or company.
8424174	8425676	He's saying Nintendo is slow.
8425816	8426076	Get it?
8426537	8426877	I get it.
8426917	8427258	I get it.
8427478	8427778	We'll see.
8427818	8428619	We'll see how that pays off.
8429240	8429540	All right.
8429960	8432903	Has a horrible, slow DarkSakura.
8433464	8434005	Boob jiggle.
8434775	8435736	Boob Jiggle!
8436376	8438238	Ooh, that's really close.
8438538	8439359	I'd say half a point.
8439599	8440139	That's really close.
8440159	8442981	And I wouldn't even say that a slow Boob Jiggle would be a bad thing.
8443021	8448005	I mean, because, you know... Alan is the unofficial... I almost said Mass Effect judge.
8448345	8452669	As the unofficial match game judge, do you think Boob Jiggle is a match with Boob Rendering?
8453389	8454070	I will allow it.
8454530	8455351	I will allow it!
8455931	8458013	Two points for SSJ100 Matt.
8458733	8459594	No points for Actdeft.
8459734	8460354	It's okay, Actdeft.
8460394	8460715	It's okay.
8461714	8464395	Rachel, a horrible, slow... Booty.
8465095	8465715	Booty!
8467476	8469477	Booty and boobies are very different.
8469577	8471377	Some people are tits, some people are ass.
8471437	8473538	So those are two different answers for sure.
8473598	8475038	If we gave them one, we're not going to give them both.
8475419	8475699	All right.
8476639	8482041	Loki, you are on record saying the Wii U has a horrible, slow...
8485363	8496093	Adoption of online protocols Adoption of online protocols Good answer, but not a match Has a horrible, slow
8496977	8526284	Bacon Grilling Peripheral Bacon Grilling Peripheral A very good Loki answer No, we don't want a horrible bacon grilling And I said the Wii U has a horrible, slow ego Ego Not a match Not a match Alright, so the score is 2-0 Actdeft, you still have two questions You still have two questions You could tie it up easy if you get one on each of these Alright, here we go to question number three
8528407	8529208	Question number three.
8531170	8537536	Rob was shocked to hear that the R4 cartridges were being banned everywhere.
8538697	8547286	Upon hearing of the latest ban, Rob shouted at Alan, quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of blanks.
8551307	8558254	Rob shouted at Alan, Quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of blank.
8558915	8561237	I don't even know what to say for this one.
8561617	8568044	In my stash of... Okay, I got one.
8571527	8573709	Quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of...
8574770	8575070	Okay.
8575430	8576371	Loki says ding.
8576731	8577592	Rachel's still thinking.
8577732	8578592	Alan says ding.
8578732	8579432	It's all right, Rachel.
8579753	8580973	I know we just met earlier tonight.
8581013	8583154	It might be hard to think of a way to razz me.
8583915	8584715	She's looking around.
8584955	8586376	What the hell is this guy like?
8586576	8587677	There's a lot of stashes here.
8587697	8589978	I'm just trying to, you know.
8590178	8590618	It's all right.
8591038	8592099	You can make something up.
8592139	8592759	They'll never know.
8592959	8593159	All right.
8593179	8593680	All right, ding.
8593760	8594040	Ding.
8594100	8594920	All right, ding it is.
8595401	8595641	All right.
8595741	8597382	And I see a ding from Actdeft.
8598522	8599883	SSJ100, Matt, you ready to answer?
8600899	8601179	Yeah, I got one.
8601199	8602041	I'm going to go with a classic match game.
8618115	8621137	Answer with Non-Cylon Occupied Caprica.
8621397	8623999	Non-Cylon Occupied Caprica.
8624280	8626921	My stash of Non-Cylon Occupied Caprica.
8627322	8632586	I don't know how well that's going to go over with somebody who is brand new to the show tonight, but we'll see what happens.
8633226	8636808	Actdeft says, dating sims and hentai games.
8637129	8643373	You have to understand there are so many people that are like, what is non-Sylon, Apricide, Caprica, even me?
8643433	8644553	I can't even say it right anymore.
8644713	8645714	It's an old ass joke.
8645754	8647035	It's a really funny joke.
8647115	8650477	Like it would have been just about as funny as if he said a mustache of big black cocks.
8651017	8652418	But he didn't.
8652558	8652859	All right.
8652999	8653339	Anyhow.
8654440	8654700	Quick.
8654720	8655160	What's that?
8657179	8658220	Can I change my answer to that?
8658240	8658700	No, you cannot.
8658760	8659560	Alright, here we go.
8659961	8660361	Quick.
8660961	8664883	Hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of... DarkSakura?
8665123	8666024	Big black cocks.
8666584	8667865	Big black cocks.
8669186	8671067	Oh, and I didn't let him change the answer.
8671987	8672447	Alright.
8672928	8673288	Quick.
8673768	8675609	Hide the... Did I really read your mind?
8677650	8678331	Alright, quick.
8678731	8679552	What do you expect?
8679572	8683075	Someone was talking about, you know, drawings of vaginas earlier.
8683175	8684376	That's true, that's true.
8684416	8690522	She's got porn on the... It sounds like Actdeft's answer of Dating Sims and Hentai Games almost was a match there.
8691102	8692203	Dating Sims and Hentai Games.
8692523	8697187	Alright, Rachel, my stash of... Twilight Books.
8697628	8698689	Twilight Books?
8698849	8699329	Get out!
8702952	8704033	I don't own Twilight Books.
8704113	8704814	You made that up.
8705248	8706910	I could have said Fifty Shades of Grey.
8706970	8707671	Look on the bright side.
8708172	8708632	That's true.
8708692	8708912	All right.
8708932	8709413	I'll give you that.
8709553	8711856	Does Rob look like a 14-year-old Mormon girl?
8712817	8716642	Well... If only we were a TV show.
8716922	8717262	All right.
8717643	8718444	Loki, quick.
8718544	8721748	Hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of... Cat pictures.
8722248	8723650	Cat pictures.
8723830	8724831	Good answer.
8724951	8725332	Not a match.
8726750	8733157	Alan, quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of... New, still-in-box President Cat merchandise.
8733977	8737121	New, still-in-box President Cat merchandise.
8737421	8737981	Not a match.
8738902	8740884	And my answer, the most important one, clearly.
8741625	8746770	Quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of... Disney pins?
8748396	8749418	That's very accurate.
8749498	8749839	I know.
8750240	8752024	Sorry I played it straight on that one.
8753507	8754389	Womp womp.
8755130	8756072	Actdeft, it is still 2-0.
8758342	8758642	Let's see.
8758742	8759563	Shane is in chat.
8759583	8763606	Shane Alinko in chat says, I own the Twilight books and I'm not a 14-year-old Mormon girl.
8763766	8764227	Yes, you are.
8764987	8767269	You make me very sad, person on chat.
8767809	8770171	Actdeft says, fuck, I was going to say President Cat.
8770271	8771292	Woulda, coulda, shoulda.
8772393	8774715	Dating Sims is a pretty good answer, though, even though I don't own any.
8775295	8775596	All right.
8776036	8777017	I have Dating Sims.
8777577	8778117	They're yowie.
8778438	8781600	Here is your chance to close the gap, Actdeft.
8781800	8783302	You feeling pretty good about this, SSJ100Map?
8784512	8785273	I'm feeling golden.
8785333	8786193	You're feeling golden.
8786213	8786654	Here you go.
8786994	8788415	One more question.
8788475	8789036	Here we go.
8789496	8790177	Last question.
8791918	8798723	Peter Molyneux recently advertised Goddess on the Cube in Curiosity.
8799784	8807630	It turns out that what Peter put inside the Cube is actually just an ad for blank.
8809738	8811640	Y'all know Curiosity, What's in the Cube?
8812160	8819966	Well, Goddess was advertised on the Cube, and it turns out what Peter put in the Cube is actually just an ad for blank.
8823049	8826472	What is in the Cube is actually just an ad for blank.
8826932	8828293	Ding in a major way.
8828654	8829074	Ding.
8829835	8830155	Ding.
8833666	8833966	Ding.
8834207	8835528	Did you say Ding, Jamie?
8835608	8836148	Yes, I did.
8836208	8839131	I said, in a major way, on top of, way to listen, Rob.
8839291	8841113	I wasn't listening to you because I was thinking of an answer.
8842194	8844776	Even though I think of the questions before the show, I don't think of the answers.
8845617	8846117	You know what?
8846137	8847819	That's a likely story, but I don't believe you.
8848139	8848480	All right.
8849020	8850441	An ad for Blank.
8851102	8851462	All right.
8851923	8855266	Looks like Actdeft is Ding and SSJ100, Matt, you ready with an answer?
8856192	8856432	Yep.
8856632	8856993	All right.
8857093	8860675	Peter Molyneux recently advertised Goddess on the Cube in Curiosity.
8861016	8867801	It turns out that what Peter put in the Cube is actually just an ad for... Ovaltine.
8868181	8869222	Ovaltine.
8869242	8873065	I like Ovaltine.
8874858	8875278	DarkSakura
8898007	8900989	What he put in the cube is actually just an ad for?
8901289	8901709	Propel.
8902150	8902930	Propel!
8904391	8905552	I'm going old school tonight.
8905572	8907233	Oh, you guys and the references.
8907313	8907733	All right.
8908193	8908734	Good answer.
8908834	8909294	Not a match.
8909694	8909915	All right.
8909955	8913517	What Peter put in the cube is actually just an ad for?
8913637	8913917	Rachel?
8914778	8916118	Goddess Catch Em All.
8916579	8918360	Goddess Catch Em All!
8921371	8922291	It burns, doesn't it?
8923052	8923952	It's not a good burn.
8924592	8929335	Ladies and gentlemen, who knew that Rachel was the 24th Magus, everybody?
8929615	8930416	Here in studio.
8932097	8933398	I will explain this to you.
8933418	8934558	Yeah, you'll have to explain that later.
8934979	8935539	Off radio.
8937554	8938994	Is she going to break a soundboard table now?
8939575	8940095	She might.
8940335	8940675	I don't know.
8940715	8943316	This table's a lot sturdier than the one that Drew broke.
8943576	8946857	After nobody matches her, she might just flip the table over.
8946897	8947277	We'll see.
8947657	8951699	All right, Loki, what Peter put in the cube is actually just an ad for?
8952279	8954980	You know, I don't know how to pronounce this, but I'm going to try to.
8955200	8957161	It's Schrodinger.
8959761	8961242	Would it be Schrodinger, Schrodinger's cat?
8962082	8964943	No, everyone likes cats, so it's just Schrodinger.
8965764	8966924	See how he likes it.
8968779	8969819	Clever answer.
8969859	8971900	That's too intellectual for you, Loki.
8971960	8972260	All right.
8972280	8974121	I'm just kidding.
8974141	8976161	Should I have said penises or like, you know?
8976221	8977742	You are a Mensa member after all.
8977842	8978182	All right.
8979162	8981503	It is just an ad for, Alan?
8982303	8984784	Pure, unsubstantiated hype, the video game.
8985424	8988625	Pure, unsubstantiated hype, the video game.
8989045	8990446	You know, that's not as good as they say.
8990867	8991227	All right.
8991748	8993089	And lastly, my answer.
8993129	8999135	We'll see if it's a match for Actdeft with the VOG Network or whatever Matt said.
8999175	9000216	I can't even remember now.
9000336	9000736	Ovaltine.
9000937	9001517	Ovaltine.
9003779	9004160	Here it is.
9004380	9008244	Peter Molyneux recently advertised Goddess on the Cube in Curiosity.
9008884	9013128	It turns out that what Peter put in the cube is actually just an ad for...
9014107	9014488	Douche.
9015089	9015931	Good night, everybody.
9018956	9021601	That's going to conclude the match game tonight.
9022122	9022964	SSJ100 Matt wins!
9026109	9030151	in a score of 2-0, Alan.
9030171	9030531	2-0.
9031232	9031552	All right.
9033453	9036995	Actdeft, thank you so much for playing, but sorry you're a loser.
9037035	9037595	There's the door.
9038195	9040377	SSJ100, Matt, congratulations.
9040557	9046040	You win, and as the winner, you get to pimp or promote anything you want to on the program tonight.
9048341	9052343	Well, I don't really have anything to promote, so I'm just going to promote the VOG Network.
9053867	9057088	Aw, it's like the ad was really in the center after all.
9057649	9057989	All right.
9058009	9058489	Feel the love.
9058509	9059689	You're so nice.
9059849	9060710	Oh, the feels.
9061010	9061550	The feels.
9061650	9061950	All right.
9062230	9062890	All the feels.
9063210	9064671	S2100Mac, congratulations.
9064691	9067132	You won the first match game on OLR in like a year and a half.
9067192	9068952	So walk away with that trophy.
9069392	9071353	And maybe somebody will try to take it from you in 2013.
9071413	9071953	We'll see.
9073134	9073594	All right.
9073634	9074214	Have a good night, buddy.
9075748	9076388	Have a good night, guys.
9076488	9076989	All right, bye.
9077889	9078889	All right, that was fun.
9078929	9079249	That was fun.
9079269	9079990	We have to do that again tonight.
9080230	9084251	Thank you, Alan, for walking in and doing a cameo, not like I pressured you into it or anything.
9084992	9085412	You're welcome.
9085812	9087873	By the way, the taquitos were A+.
9088013	9088293	Thank you.
9088846	9089727	It was quite delicious.
9089767	9090147	Thank you.
9090307	9091768	Alan takes good care of us during the show.
9091808	9092449	We appreciate it.
9093150	9093470	All right.
9094911	9106200	Let us move on with a few more stories and then we're going to open up the Skype line for regular calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR or of course our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9106600	9112345	Oh, we have more stuff we've got to get to before we get to the stories though such as the mailbag.
9116588	9126972	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us your emails and DarkSakura will dive into the mailbag head first and read a few emails that tickles your fancy.
9127052	9128293	What's inside the mailbag?
9132233	9141696	Have you ever tried placing your games in a numbered list and picking a number at random?
9142236	9149158	I've been surprised on many occasions to find out how much fun I've had playing an old game or playing a game I thought I was not in the mood for thanks to this method.
9150078	9153679	MMORPGs get a number for each character.
9156408	9157549	Take care and happy gaming.
9179434	9186118	We tried this and got so wiped out trying to list every freaking game that we own that no.
9186718	9188219	It spread out to imaginary numbers.
9188239	9190061	There was algebra involved and it wasn't pretty.
9191241	9195124	You had to use the E plus 10 and all that stuff to get the games in there.
9195424	9196184	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9221291	9222411	I think I do, actually.
9222672	9223492	Now, here's the other question.
9223512	9225292	Would each copy of Space Harrier get a number?
9227813	9228093	All right.
9228573	9229133	Next email.
9231214	9232534	Next up.
9233274	9234175	Oh, that was the one I just read.
9236015	9237096	They're very small.
9237556	9239716	This one comes from Will.
9241177	9244718	I strangely enjoy when Rob breaks into the show to give the VOG passphrase.
9244758	9245778	He sounds so serious.
9247250	9247710	That's it?
9248571	9251874	Today's password is cheeseball.
9251994	9253295	That's not really the password.
9253515	9253755	No.
9254416	9254936	I don't pick that.
9254996	9256878	The password... It's randomly generated.
9256918	9262022	Yeah, the passphrases get picked for me after the show with a little thing that Bobby wrote.
9262042	9263744	Today's passcode is cock.
9264424	9265045	No, it's not.
9265185	9266066	Don't put that in the box.
9266306	9267927	She doesn't know it because we don't know it until after the show.
9267947	9268728	What if a elephant did pop up?
9269008	9272773	It's not going to have cock because Bobby filtered all the adult words off of it, I'm sure.
9273253	9274135	Dang it, Bobby!
9275096	9279481	It'll be spelled with a zero and a five in place of the S. You know what, Bobby?
9279541	9280002	Remind me.
9280122	9285469	April Fool's Day next year, people who put naughty words in the box unlock a bar of soap trophy.
9285569	9286310	Can we make that happen?
9287150	9288792	You got four months to work on it.
9289593	9292836	Here's a chance for me to re-pimp this, though, because we haven't talked about it in a while.
9293356	9301884	If you listen to the shows live at vognetwork.com, you can check into the show as the show is happening and get your five VOG points, which go for the loot.
9302205	9303466	And what do VOG points get you?
9303966	9305188	Absolutely nothing.
9305648	9307711	But what does Foursquare and Facebook check-ins give you?
9307751	9309713	It's just a fun little game within a game.
9310114	9313378	And someday there may be more to come from it in 2013.
9313438	9315160	We're throwing around ideas.
9315180	9315240	But...
9319665	9320946	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9343408	9350350	Although you still can check in just to register yourself as you listen to the podcast and you listen live just to see if there were any differences.
9351050	9352171	But you don't get the extra points.
9352431	9354031	But anyhow, we hope you'll play along.
9354291	9361193	It's just a fun thing to do at vognetwork.com and we do look to adding some fun little no prizes.
9361253	9365675	Maybe the person with the most amount of points will get to program the station for a day.
9365795	9366935	I'm throwing it out there.
9367335	9368195	These aren't actual things.
9368476	9369656	But we're looking to doing things like that.
9369716	9372317	Translated to give Bobby a migraine for a day.
9374197	9378599	And Tiger Claw and Actdeft in chat remind us, bragging rights is what you get.
9378840	9379620	Bragging rights.
9379980	9384542	I like no prizes like Marvel used to do where the people would just get a blank envelope.
9384822	9396808	I think maybe in 2013 what we should do, especially since we're all getting into, like you're doing crocheting and all these different projects, we should give our leaderboard leader every month a homemade prize for
9397208	9398629	That means I have to make it.
9398649	9399949	No, no, it doesn't have to be you every time.
9400089	9400429	You can do one.
9400449	9401910	We can make something out of popsicle sticks.
9402410	9404451	But remember, there's more than just us on VOG.
9404651	9404991	Hello.
9405791	9407111	It could be like, you know, one week.
9407171	9411553	It could be maybe Brad from PodCulture could send, you know, something homemade.
9411573	9412393	This is what we should do.
9413294	9413994	Have a contest.
9414074	9415034	It starts in January.
9415634	9415975	Okay?
9416535	9424397	Whoever gets the top of the leaderboard the most times in the period of a year gets an orange beanie crocheted by me.
9424417	9424838	Okay.
9426328	9427229	Last email, this comes from Travis
9451127	9452248	No, not Donovan.
9453408	9454049	Hey, gang.
9454169	9455369	Haven't wrote or called in a while.
9455449	9460112	Thought I would drop a line and say, hey, I got a Wii U over the weekend and heard Rob talking about his last episode.
9460732	9461893	I'm happy with it so far.
9462093	9463253	I have an eight-yo.
9463654	9464234	Sorry, year old.
9466096	9467577	and he absolutely loves it.
9467697	9469639	Also, friends and family have a blast with it too.
9470199	9474182	Just wondering, after a week of having it, what do you think?
9474983	9475303	Rob?
9476024	9476764	Get out of the fridge.
9476784	9477605	Come answer the question.
9477625	9478606	I wanted an Oreo.
9478686	9479427	I want an Oreo.
9479987	9480327	Thank you.
9482188	9483169	You want an Oreo too, Rachel?
9483449	9484009	I'll get you an Oreo later.
9484069	9484349	I'm good.
9484509	9485309	All right.
9487370	9489170	Well, I talked about the Wii U at the top of the show.
9489210	9490551	I don't think I have a lot else to add.
9491051	9493832	I am not disappointed with my investment.
9494192	9500554	But again, how important is Mario and Nintendo Land and some of these like Zombie U?
9500614	9502155	How important are those games to you?
9502275	9505356	If you think you can wait on those games till 2013, then wait.
9505776	9509777	But if you want to play them now and you have the financial resources available to play them now,
9509997	9510658	Then go get one.
9511459	9511880	It's fun.
9513602	9514143	Keep talking.
9516466	9517147	No, I'm done.
9517167	9524177	That's all I have to say on the Wii U. I talked for like 40 minutes during part A. Oreos from the fridge are the best.
9525178	9526320	Matt, you want one?
9527000	9527181	No.
9528041	9529002	I do not want an Oreo.
9529442	9532725	I'm pretty excited about Lego City, a new Zelda and an F-Zero game.
9533705	9539590	Being a PlayStation fanboy and a PC gamer, I have to say I'm not blown away, but still very impressed with it.
9539610	9540331	Well, it's all in caps.
9540351	9541531	How else am I supposed to emote that?
9543213	9547416	Oh, by the way, I friend requested you, but we'll have to do it again under a different name.
9547456	9551179	Long story short, I had to get a replacement system as my first one I purchased was faulty.
9551699	9551959	Quoty.
9552200	9552500	Faulty.
9554161	9554982	That sucks.
9555802	9556963	You have some bad luck.
9557564	9557744	Done.
9561678	9569040	Jason is quick to correct me in the chat room at live.vognetwork.com Gmail hasn't been in beta for more than a few years now.
9569440	9570060	Whatever.
9571220	9574341	We've been in beta for like, what, eight months?
9575341	9577561	Gmail was in beta for like six years.
9578481	9579342	We have a ways to go.
9579722	9580702	Hyperbole what now?
9582662	9582942	All right.
9584203	9586063	Let's get into the FUs of the week.
9601892	9609036	Now, Rachel, since you're new to the FUs of the Week, I don't know if Jamie told you about this in the car ride, but this is the part of the show where we just get to rant.
9609616	9609976	Why?
9610517	9611677	Well, because we have your attention.
9611857	9613799	And when I have your attention, I like to rant.
9614199	9614979	So it's the FUs of the Week.
9615660	9616160	DarkSakura?
9616560	9618221	I don't particularly have an FU.
9618961	9623104	I have a thank you to someone for saving me the trouble of doing what I planned on doing anyway.
9625625	9626285	Hiding a body?
9627026	9627146	No.
9628055	9628476	Alright.
9629197	9629637	Uh, Loki.
9630618	9636426	I have to do the whole ride over here because for some reason, like, everybody was out to try to kill me or something on the road.
9636846	9638829	Like, there's a dude... I hate it when they do this.
9639109	9642613	Like, when there's people waiting to, like, pull out of an inner... either, like, a...
9643254	9644314	DarkSakura.com
9668991	9670534	Take fucking attention, people.
9670575	9671958	Seriously, you're going to kill somebody.
9672920	9673621	And hopefully not me.
9674922	9695366	My FU of the week goes to Oreos for being so delicious and addicting Oh my god, but no, the other thing about that is I want to give an FU to the fact that I never got to have the birthday cake Oreos because they disappeared from shelves so fast and, and, real problems guys I never got to have the candy corn Oreos because they disappeared from shelves so fast Why can I make these special Oreos if I can't find them?
9695606	9701887	And while I'm at it, FU to the fact that there are no pumpkin kisses this year That is a travesty
9703109	9704089	True Travesty.
9704449	9707190	Didn't you hold on to like a pack of those for like six months?
9707250	9708770	I did and they were still delicious.
9709490	9710291	Sorry not sorry.
9711331	9712551	I partook of them too.
9712931	9714172	eBay changed their logo!
9714792	9715932	Yeah, like months ago.
9716052	9719313	Yeah, but I haven't looked at eBay in months.
9720413	9723234	Alright, and last but not least, Rachel, do you have any FUs you want to get out?
9724414	9729135	Oh, you know, I'd like to say FU to Michael Bay because, you know, you can never FU that guy enough.
9729827	9732428	You know, on eBay, they are... That is a worthy first FU.
9732468	9732888	Good job.
9732928	9733268	Good job.
9733328	9736209	You know, on eBay, they are selling those candy corn Oreos.
9737510	9738110	Fuck eBay.
9738990	9740971	Limited edition, like... 15 bucks.
9741191	9744992	Brad from PodCulture says, Rob Roberts, try the gingerbread Oreos.
9746293	9748193	They have gingerbread Oreos?
9748733	9749774	I need this in my life.
9750014	9750734	Ermager!
9751734	9752435	I need this in my life.
9752455	9752975	Gingerbread!
9756010	9758192	I need a cat in my life, Rob.
9785151	9789153	However, because, no, not day one, because of their DRM.
9789813	9797836	They said, though, that the extra sales that they got at that time had helped them have new staff members for this year's release for Football Manager 13.
9798896	9805959	And had they been hired day one, they probably wouldn't have the money to have the extra staff.
9806699	9807020	So...
9808260	9824906	Yeah, right now, I guess the new game has a new DRM system, and as of right now, hasn't been cracked, although they haven't, I don't know when that came out, and they said that if they can hold on for three or four more weeks, then it'll really benefit retailers and themselves.
9828186	9828826	Is it working?
9830187	9838511	I mean, it's good when it works in the effort to get people to actually legitimately buy your copies of your games.
9839131	9851617	However, when you have it implemented in a way like Ubisoft does, where it hurts the actual consumers that buy your games and kind of punishes them, whereas the person that has the cracked copy has no issues, then that's the problem.
9851637	9853418	So you just kind of have to find that happy medium in there.
9853965	9861808	I kind of think it's interesting how they talk about that like, you know, as long as we can hold off like three weeks before we get cracked, then we'll be good.
9861888	9863529	We'll still sell a lot of copies of the game.
9863889	9867891	I find it interesting that they just kind of give into the fact that like, yeah, hackers gonna hack.
9868111	9869631	They're gonna get into the game eventually.
9870112	9876034	But it also, you know, that mentality that the majority, the vast majority of games are in their first week.
9876654	9883037	So I find it very interesting that it's like, as long as we can hold off to week three, enough people will have bought it by then that whatever at that point.
9883937	9908908	very interesting but uh yeah I also agree with what Loki said as long as you know anti-piracy you got to do what you got to do but as long as it works so all right uh moving on to one more story tonight I can't believe this but uh if you're in Finland you've got some weird taste that's all I gotta say no offense but you guys have some weird taste you know what panties
9909928	9910148	No.
9910909	9913329	Well, yes, but it means something different in Finnish.
9913790	9918871	Anyway, she's referring to what is written on the can for Angry Birds Soda.
9919552	9922533	You know, Angry Birds has been licensed for everything.
9922613	9927935	I'm sure there's Angry Birds diapers at this point and whatever, even here in America.
9928035	9931176	But over in Finland, they have Angry Birds Soda.
9931816	9933437	And here's the crazy thing about it.
9934777	9938779	It's actually outselling Coke and Pepsi in Finland.
9940132	9940453	What?
9942443	9942905	Alright then.
9943856	9950339	Peter Vesterbacca from Rovio says that the soda will make its way to Australia and New Zealand in the near future.
9951119	9953240	And they say it will probably come to the U.S.
9953300	9954641	eventually as well.
9955461	9959663	So could Angry Birds someday outsell Coke and Pepsi here in America?
9959983	9961444	I can only hope it's smelt flavored.
9962385	9963885	In Alabama, everything is a Coke.
9964345	9965726	It doesn't matter what drink it is, it's Coke.
9965746	9966786	So I doubt it.
9967487	9969148	Unless you're in the Midwest, then it becomes pop.
9969448	9970088	Everything's pop.
9970268	9970929	Oh, I hate that.
9971029	9972010	Oh, it's like nails on chalkboard.
9972030	9972550	I hate pop.
9972650	9976053	I hate... Pop is what you do to bubble gum, not soda.
9976293	9977574	How about a sody pop?
9977934	9978695	No!
9979376	9983119	Soda pop was the name of one of the boxers in the original Punch-Out!!
9984440	9985721	And that's where it stays.
9987082	9993107	It's gonna be weird one of these days when Mario becomes less recognizable to Red Bird.
9995222	9996864	Give the birds fucking names!
9997224	9998165	I mean, seriously.
9999006	10008135	It's going to continue a trend of streamlining the shape and the name to the point where it's just going to be a dot on the screen and it will be because spelling the entire word is tiring.
10009161	10016747	The Skype line is now open at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
10017307	10021790	Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Lounge Radio, all one word.
10021850	10023091	The Skype line is open.
10023251	10024252	And there you go, Nintendo.
10024272	10036121	You can totally rip off Angry Birds by creating bullet bills and then having its own game where you're just firing bullet bills and have them, I don't know, do something.
10037482	10038423	You can combat this.
10039321	10040062	Hello, hello One more time
10066961	10068301	Oh, you got to call Echo123.
10068721	10069001	All right.
10069842	10070822	Let's try another call.
10070882	10071902	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10071922	10072302	Who's this?
10073942	10075343	Hey, this is Duke Nukem.
10076583	10079444	I was wondering, what's your guys' favorite Thanksgiving item?
10079464	10081804	Because I don't think it's been mentioned yet this episode.
10082624	10086945	Duke Nukem wants to know, what is everybody's favorite Thanksgiving item?
10086985	10089126	Because we haven't mentioned it yet this episode.
10089486	10090346	What a good question.
10090366	10092626	I'm so happy it has absolutely nothing to do with video games.
10092666	10093966	But we like to take a break once in a while.
10094267	10096247	What's more important than video games, Duke Nukem?
10098766	10099126	Food!
10099447	10099807	Food!
10099907	10100488	That's the answer.
10100749	10102291	What did you say?
10102771	10104093	Never mind.
10104333	10106376	What's more important than video games, Duke Nukem?
10108427	10110128	Pie, the answer is pie.
10110248	10111608	No, the answer is Cox.
10111848	10112068	Yeah.
10112649	10113509	All right, all right.
10114009	10116390	Let's go around and get everybody's... Sorry, my phone is going out.
10116670	10117490	That's all right, that's all right.
10117750	10119851	We'll go around and get everybody's answers here for you.
10119911	10122312	So what is everybody's favorite Thanksgiving item?
10122832	10123552	DarkSakura.
10123752	10124113	Garris.
10125853	10126694	Cooked Garris?
10127574	10128314	No, oh, cooked?
10128334	10135797	Calibrated to a crisp brown... You know, it has to be actually the chocolate chip pumpkin pie that Becky helped me make.
10136557	10137938	Chocolate chip pumpkin pie.
10138178	10138759	It was epic.
10139119	10139479	All right.
10139779	10140020	All right.
10140620	10140940	Rachel.
10141060	10143742	Turkey skin.
10143962	10144903	Wait, what, Duke Nukem?
10146933	10148975	Somebody has to claim the bacon-wrapped turkey.
10149956	10150577	Yes, that's right.
10152318	10153179	That's just nasty.
10153940	10154680	Swanson, yes.
10154780	10155161	I'm sorry.
10155781	10159465	One more time, Rachel, because I got distracted by... It's turkey skin.
10159485	10161366	Turkey skin.
10161527	10164249	You have to say it like that, because otherwise, what is even the point?
10164930	10165210	All right.
10165230	10165911	Loki.
10166011	10166251	Loki.
10167120	10170903	Yams and pumpkin pie I don't know why, it's just like they...
10196838	10202301	I don't know, they have this sweet yet, I don't know, sour kind of flavor the way my grandma makes them.
10203082	10204762	She puts a little bit of lemon juice in there.
10204782	10207904	It's just like this thing that you don't have any other day of the year.
10208745	10209985	And you always look forward to it.
10210025	10213207	Just that one dish is worth another 364 days.
10214007	10215989	That's a really sweet, sentimental answer.
10216069	10223673	But I can tell that you're an imposter, Duke Nukem, because the real Duke Nukem would have said, my favorite Thanksgiving food is kicking ass.
10225600	10230462	No, his favorite Thanksgiving food would be bubble gum and he'd be chewing it.
10230482	10232583	The one day of the year he actually gets to chew gum.
10232923	10235424	Alright, any other thoughts for the listeners before I let you go?
10237745	10241967	No, just happy holidays you guys and keep on listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
10241987	10243288	I love this show.
10243388	10245289	We will keep listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
10245349	10245769	You too.
10245929	10249390	I don't listen to a damn thing anybody else on this show says.
10249951	10250651	I'm sorry, what's that?
10251917	10256100	Alright, so the listeners, not the people who keep putting it out there, of course.
10256220	10257762	You guys are the hosts.
10258042	10259363	Fine, I'll stop listening.
10259683	10261965	Seriously, fuck those guys.
10262625	10264107	We really appreciate it, Duke Newcomb.
10264367	10265648	Thanks for the question and take care.
10266977	10267637	Yeah, take care
10283542	10284223	Patch Update 1.5
10306243	10315087	Also, they're saying variable signal strength stuff, as well as some additions to the minecarts, ways to link minecarts together.
10316288	10321450	Also, they're saying they're going to have a special block that's going to allow people to dump off cargo.
10321810	10329134	Sounds like a lot of stuff they were kind of inspired by Tekkit, where they're going to have piping systems for you moving stuff to chests and that kind of thing.
10331035	10331475	Pretty cool.
10331535	10336698	And also some new nether-based ore that I guess will be used to make capacitors.
10336838	10339179	Alright, let me hold that thought while we go to the phones.
10339239	10340199	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10340219	10340599	Who's this?
10343181	10344821	This is the dead call again.
10345622	10346222	I think you're muted.
10346262	10346702	Hello?
10347383	10347903	Hello?
10348903	10349364	Hello?
10350324	10350744	Goodbye.
10351425	10352825	Let's try another one here.
10353206	10354186	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10354206	10354586	Who's this?
10355227	10356327	This is one and only Ranma.
10356487	10356967	Hey, Ranma.
10357027	10357848	I'm a good Ranma!
10361455	10362396	How you doing, Ranma?
10363836	10367256	Alive, awake, stuffed, and full.
10368157	10368837	Full of what?
10370177	10373397	Oh my god, Thanksgiving dinner.
10373878	10375558	What's your favorite Thanksgiving meal?
10376078	10377038	Or Thanksgiving dish?
10378278	10380099	Sweet potato pie.
10380219	10381219	Sweet potatoes.
10381239	10381899	Oh, lovely.
10382219	10382879	Sweet potatoes.
10383199	10385519	Our Friendsgiving had mashed sweet potatoes.
10386120	10386640	Good stuff.
10388993	10389793	So what's on your mind, buddy?
10389993	10390494	Why'd you call?
10391154	10397617	Well, first off, in response about talking about eating Oreos earlier, I can't eat one.
10397657	10398797	It's considered cannibalism.
10399177	10401618	Do not repeat the joke you made in chat.
10401998	10403199	I don't want an explicit tag this week.
10403219	10404279	Leave me just like that.
10405500	10405900	All right.
10408101	10410122	I know, this is a PG-13 podcast.
10410222	10411302	Yes, yes, exactly.
10411342	10412142	Well, what else is on your mind?
10412182	10414523	However, I'll allow you to say it if you get me that $65 Garris figure.
10417025	10417685	Don't listen to her.
10418566	10422048	You have to talk to my accountant right now, so yeah.
10423689	10425750	So what's going on in your gaming world, Ranma?
10428152	10428992	Not too much.
10430513	10444182	The only game I've been doing has been on my tablet, and I was checking eBay on Saturday, and I'm like, wow, I really kind of feel bad for those people who stood on those long lines to grab a Wii U just to flip it, because you know what?
10444702	10445863	That was going to be me.
10448438	10450520	I ain't got pity in the world for those people.
10450620	10456966	Even if you had done it yourself, Ranma, I would have said, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
10457807	10458287	Hey, Ranma.
10459008	10459268	Yes.
10459348	10459669	Ha.
10461571	10463733	The most expensive one I saw was $405 with 70 bids.
10468191	10468471	Wow.
10468531	10476180	Well, I mean, you know, it's just either people are resisting or it's just it's not that hard to come by right now.
10476641	10483108	You know, you can still find basics on shelves in some places and some people are just saying, you know what, I'd rather buy a basic than buy from an eBay flipper.
10484019	10484399	I know.
10484719	10489482	And I remember during the whole Wii U sales, they were going as high as $2,500, $3,000.
10491763	10502009	And I saw ads where you would get Wii, all the released games, 5.1 surround sound system, 50-inch LCD TV.
10502289	10507012	I'll dress up as Santa and bring it to your house and deliver it for your kids on Christmas Day.
10507992	10508973	Good Lord.
10509113	10510194	How much did that go for?
10510916	10511937	Those are going as high as $3,000.
10511997	10515520	That's not a bad deal for all that shit.
10516981	10524388	I expect to see something like that around the holidays for the Wii U. Ranma, will you dress up as Santa and come over to my house and give out the presents?
10525048	10526249	Does it come with full release?
10529933	10530313	Wow.
10532255	10534517	Does my visit from Santa come with a happy ending?
10537907	10540527	Rob, that was bad and you should feel bad.
10541008	10541448	I do.
10542488	10544268	It ain't Black Santa, it's Mary Kwanzaa, fool!
10548529	10549989	I pity you through the dual light candles.
10551949	10552370	How's that?
10553510	10554070	Close enough.
10554090	10556410	Time for me to wear my Mary Kwanzaa bitch's shirt again.
10556690	10560151	How about I send you over to Jamie's house on Christmas because that would be hilarious.
10562111	10566632	If you send me to Jamie's house for Christmas, I might not leave because you know she has that southern cooking I love.
10567968	10569109	You know, I can do it too.
10570550	10573732	I will make grits and mashed potatoes.
10575854	10577555	Grits and mashed potatoes!
10577995	10588363	I'm not going to totally advertise this to all the listeners everywhere, but Alan and I have been talking about starting a new Christmas tradition out of the one we started last year.
10588783	10591005	And that is taking our Jewish friends...
10591505	10593566	to Asian food on Christmas.
10593747	10594207	That's right.
10594247	10594807	We did that.
10594827	10595388	We did that last year.
10595648	10596989	We went out for pho, didn't we?
10597009	10597509	Yeah, we did.
10597589	10599831	So Alan and I want to extend that again this year.
10599851	10601171	I'm down for that.
10601312	10602933	We might try to get some other people to come along this year.
10602953	10604754	We even sort of made a half joke.
10605654	10610117	Two gay men and a Jew walk into a Vietnamese restaurant.
10610137	10611238	It's a new sitcom.
10611398	10613680	Two gay men and a Jew at a Vietnamese restaurant.
10613700	10616241	I don't know the punchline, but there's one in there somewhere.
10617182	10621345	Jumas has been a long-time tradition in my house for the last seven years.
10621745	10622706	Chris McQuanzica.
10623486	10624187	There you go.
10624307	10624787	There you go.
10625167	10625888	All right, Ranma.
10625988	10627549	I was calling it Holiday Mass.
10627829	10629550	Merry Festivus to you.
10629570	10633132	That's for the rest of us.
10633212	10634914	If there's nothing else, then I'm going to let you go.
10635754	10636214	Works for me.
10636495	10637155	All right, take care, buddy.
10637695	10637916	Later.
10638116	10638336	Bye.
10639477	10641378	I'm telling you guys, the Oreo joke was really bad.
10641778	10642938	Alright, that's going to do it for the Skype line.
10642958	10645319	We're running way over three hours tonight, so I'm going to wrap it up.
10645359	10648780	Sorry to those that didn't get through, but if you didn't get through, you should send us an email.
10648840	10654722	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com Or you can always send us a tweet or any of that stuff.
10655143	10657083	I want to let Loki finish up the last minute stories.
10657764	10658964	I've got to get to Twitter topics too.
10659524	10664188	One last thing, there was another app that was announced called Minecraft Reality.
10664648	10673015	It's an augmented reality app for iOS, and it can display 3D Minecraft images in the real world, and you can walk around them and stuff.
10673536	10675617	And it looked pretty cool from the little trailer that they had.
10676238	10677859	So you can check that out.
10677999	10680341	It's $2 to download.
10683217	10687099	I actually have a last minute story because this just finished while we were doing the show tonight.
10687139	10691540	The Kickstarter for the Shadowgate reboot has ended and they made it.
10692201	10695062	So the Shadowgate reimagining is going to be happening.
10695642	10696262	Which one?
10698851	10707133	Shadowgate Shadowrun The old school NES game and Mac game Deja Vu, etc.
10707473	10724896	Not only did they make their $120,000 for the base game, but they made their first stretch goal of $130,000 meaning they're going to expand on the castle and add some rooms and puzzles 15% more game So, pretty cool Congratulations to the team there who make Shadowgate
10726277	10727357	Let's get to the Twitter topics.
10728318	10730119	I'm really excited about that Shadowgate reboot, though.
10730239	10733120	I actually, that's only the second Kickstarter I've ever given to.
10733221	10735002	So I've done GamerCon, and I did that one.
10735962	10736622	So we'll see.
10737543	10745788	There's part of me that wants to give to the Molyneux project, but then I'm like, that guy is such a... The advertisement, again, really, really turned me off a little bit.
10746568	10746848	Alright.
10748289	10748749	Let's see.
10748889	10751049	Going to some tweets.
10753650	10754870	Twitter.com slash OLR.
10755270	10760532	Actdeft wants to remind us the Gold Nunchuck will make its return to Club Nintendo tomorrow.
10760792	10763532	900 points for the Golden Nunchuck because they need to get rid of him.
10764633	10766093	I really need this in my life, Rob.
10766393	10767093	You don't understand.
10767153	10767973	What, the Golden Nunchuck?
10768133	10768334	No.
10768554	10769874	What?
10770594	10774155	The Garrus figure that's... A Zekstal?
10777077	10777517	That's what?
10777817	10778437	A sex doll.
10778898	10779218	No.
10780478	10783500	It's someone linked it to me for cheaper.
10787141	10787562	All right.
10787842	10788922	And let's see.
10789042	10793324	Moving on to the next tweet from Tiger Claw.
10793825	10794865	Oh, I did read about this.
10796326	10800287	007 Legends Studio Eurocom laid off a big chunk of its staff this week.
10801028	10803229	And he links us to a story I'm trying to bring up right now.
10804910	10812077	The Eurocom Studio, which is based in the UK, laid off the majority of its workforce as part of restructuring.
10812377	10813558	The studio has been around since 88.
10813978	10816421	Yeah, they made a lot of games besides just this.
10816561	10822146	They also did 007 Reloaded and then, of course, Legends, which wasn't very well received, unfortunately.
10823066	10831788	Eurocom director Hugh Binns said that, quote, Eurocom are undertaking a restructuring which I regret to say has meant we've made the majority of our workforce redundant today.
10831848	10833348	That's the British word for laying off.
10834369	10841290	This includes many very experienced, talented, and highly skilled employees, and we'd like to thank them all for your hard work and efforts.
10841790	10844511	And they say this is because of the decline in the video game market.
10845271	10847192	The studio had to cancel a number of projects.
10847992	10849072	That sucks.
10850714	10858437	And lastly, SSJ100 Matt sends us this tweet about, we all know playing games while driving is a terrible idea, but one game is trying to change that.
10860918	10861959	Bright Driver.
10862822	10863462	is what it's called.
10863522	10865203	It's an iPhone app called Bright Driver.
10865303	10872706	It's a platform that supports audio games people play in the car to keep their attention from lagging during long rides.
10873206	10883949	It uses GPS functionality to keep track of the user's driving using metrics like speed, break rate, and stressful conditions like traffic and the games modify their pace appropriately.
10884370	10885470	That is crazy.
10886430	10887271	That's kind of cool.
10887751	10889812	Like an audio game that you interact with.
10890552	10890792	Huh.
10891372	10892432	I want to hear more about this.
10892452	10895353	I'll have to read the rest of the story for a future week, but that sounds kind of cool.
10896614	10900315	So that's it for the tweets tonight at twitter.com slash OLR.
10900715	10903856	And this means we're at the end of the show.
10904656	10904797	Aw.
10905997	10908358	Rachel, thank you very much for coming to the show tonight.
10908778	10909518	Thank you for having me.
10909558	10910118	And sitting in.
10910158	10910919	Come back anytime.
10911579	10912099	I surely will.
10912359	10914060	and we'll talk to you again.
10915240	10919803	It may have taken you 480 episodes to get here but it doesn't look like we're going to go anywhere anytime soon.
10919843	10922984	Duke Nukem told us we need to keep listening so I guess we're here for a little while.
10923945	10925465	Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10930548	10931588	Yeah.
10931788	10932189	Quick plug?
10932629	10933189	Sure, of course.
10933409	10934990	Greetings from the wasteland at WordPress.
10935210	10939052	I do creepypasta and I do write about video games occasionally.
10939397	10939697	DarkSakura
10957506	10959226	Someone really needs to get me the Garrus figure.
10959406	10960367	I'm not even kidding.
10960887	10963547	Does it come with full release?
10963587	10965808	Does it come with Tumblr rendered VJ?
10965848	10966648	All right.
10967168	10971889	And my final thought tonight, as always, thank you all for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
10972249	10975530	If you enjoyed the show, please tell a friend or two or 20 about the show.
10975890	10978790	Help us spread the word because we don't have any major websites behind us.
10979171	10980971	I mean, we have the VOG Network, but let's be...
10981491	10985373	Let's be real, it's not exactly a oneup.com or a giant bomb.
10985833	10987494	So, you know, help spread the word.
10987514	10988714	A website that generates revenue.
10988814	10989955	Exactly, exactly.
10990255	10991215	It's a fun project.
10991255	10991675	But you know what?
10991695	10993996	There are more great shows on VOG.
10994036	10994857	It is not just us.
10995197	10996998	There are lots and lots of great shows on VOG.
10998018	11000039	Bobby Blackwolf before us Sunday nights.
11001099	11002660	Under Station Live on Saturday nights.
11003420	11006882	Mondays are full of pod culture, British invaders, and critical myth.
11007222	11010563	Critical Myth, the hardworking guys, they're on three times a week on the network.
11010963	11012483	Anime Jam Session on Tuesday.
11013243	11014824	Girls Gone Wow on Wednesday.
11015164	11016524	And Horde House, they're okay.
11017084	11018025	Also on Wednesday.
11019165	11019785	So there you go.
11019825	11023266	Yes, as Black Wolf says in chat, VOG Network, it's a website.
11025106	11026026	That's a good final thought.
11026346	11027087	It's a website.
11028067	11030727	We'll see you next time on our website.
11031548	11032348	Have a good night, everybody.
