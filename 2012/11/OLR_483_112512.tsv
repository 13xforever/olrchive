7000	14000	Who's your hosts? DarkSakura, Skie, and Loki
14000	20000	Tonight, November 25th, 2012, could a new scaled down Xbox 360 be on the way?
20000	27000	Sony's credit rating is reduced, and Japan bans the sale of a controversial cartridge.
27000	31000	Orange Lounge Radio
31000	37000	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37000	45000	It is Orange Lounge Radio, live with this episode number 483 for November 25th, 2012.
45000	53000	My name is Rob Roberts, and I'm here to talk to you guys about video games and what's going on in gaming culture and so forth with my co-host.
53000	57000	Say hello, first off, to the one, the only, DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
57000	59000	You should really watch where that glass is.
59000	61000	Oh, with the mic cords and everything?
61000	67000	I didn't want to knock it off and then onto your knee and have you curse loudly, although that might have been funny, but it would have been very poor radio.
67000	71000	Yes, broken glass going into my foot, not a good radio time.
71000	73000	No, but it would have been hilarious here.
73000	75000	Not really. Heart, heart, heart, heart.
75000	79000	Also say hello, what is it, less than slash three.
79000	83000	Also say hello to Techmaster Loki.
83000	84000	Hi.
84000	85000	How are you, Loki?
85000	86000	Good.
86000	87000	Alright, what's new with you?
87000	88000	Not much.
88000	89000	Did you have a good holiday?
89000	90000	Yeah, it was fun.
90000	91000	Eat a lot?
91000	92000	Yes.
92000	93000	Good, good times.
93000	97000	I read about the adventures of your child sitting under the tree eating spaghetti.
97000	99000	A spaghetti Thanksgiving?
99000	100000	Nellie posted something.
100000	101000	How does that work?
101000	102000	Eating spaghetti under the tree.
102000	103000	Or eating some food under the tree.
103000	104000	Maybe turkey?
104000	105000	Maybe turkey?
105000	106000	Alright.
106000	110000	Anyhow, also say hello to the ever present fourth guest in our chat room.
110000	116000	Live.vognetwork.com is the place to be where you can read comments such as Jason who says,
116000	119000	Rob sounds particularly more energetic tonight.
119000	121000	And Brad from Pod Culture says, probably lots of coffee.
121000	122000	That's true.
122000	124000	Yes, four cups today.
124000	125000	That's true.
125000	128000	Alright, we do have another guest joining us in studio.
128000	129000	Somebody new to the show.
129000	133000	Can you believe there's still people in Sacramento who play video games who haven't been on this
133000	134000	show?
134000	135000	But we do have somebody new to the show tonight.
135000	137000	I don't know if you have a nickname you'd like to go by.
137000	140000	What do you want me to introduce you to tonight?
140000	143000	Wordpress handle is Rakshasa Rani.
143000	144000	Rakshasa.
144000	145000	Are you a Kingdom Hearts girl?
145000	146000	Is that where Rakshasa comes from?
146000	147000	No, no.
147000	148000	It's Rakshasa Rani.
148000	152000	It basically translates to Ogre Queen, but I'm sure it's improperly conjugated.
152000	153000	Okay, that's alright.
153000	154000	That's alright.
154000	155000	Well, hello and welcome to the show.
155000	157000	Don't expect me to be able to repeat that.
157000	158000	Can I call you by your first name?
158000	159000	Yes, go right ahead.
159000	161000	I'm gonna call you Rachel because that's what your name is.
161000	163000	So hi Rachel, welcome to the show.
163000	164000	Not Indian at all.
164000	165000	But a good-
165000	167000	But we could go rahel.
167000	171000	A good plug for your Wordpress right at the top of the show.
171000	174000	That's the way to sell your site here on Orange Lounge Radio.
174000	176000	So, welcome to the show.
176000	179000	You and Jamie go to school together or something like that, right?
179000	181000	We slave away on the magazine together.
181000	182000	Okay.
182000	183000	Good times.
183000	186000	And we're both kind of subbing on the other side pretty much.
186000	190000	You know, I've always felt more part of the writing process.
190000	194000	But this year I'm on the design team whereas Jamie, who is an excellent designer, is now
194000	196000	on the English side of it.
196000	198000	Yeah, so we're sort of crossed over.
198000	205000	But that means we both see what goes on on each side and then go, what's up with that?
205000	208000	So, you guys are frenzies from school.
208000	213000	So, how did you guys- obviously you guys connected because you're both obviously geeky gals,
213000	214000	which is great.
214000	215000	We love geeky gals.
215000	217000	How did you guys kind of find that connection?
217000	219000	Through many rides home.
219000	220000	Yes.
220000	222000	And series of conversations the first semester.
222000	223000	And yarn.
223000	224000	Yes.
224000	225000	Oh, yes.
225000	226000	And yarn.
226000	227000	Which I'm working on during the show again.
227000	228000	Lots of you.
228000	229000	More crochet.
229000	233000	You were mentioning earlier that you are very experienced with yarn and all that stuff.
233000	234000	So, very cool.
234000	236000	And she's a fantastic potter.
236000	237000	Oh, thank you.
237000	242000	And that's really my only contribution to the yarn store is because my mother's more
242000	243000	of a crocheter.
243000	244000	My sister knits.
245000	246000	I do these things called yarn bowls.
246000	250000	And basically it's just, you know, yarn accessories works out pretty well for me.
250000	254000	Well, all this talk about knitting and crocheting and pottery is going to go over great with
254000	255000	our teen male audience.
255000	256000	But-
256000	257000	Hi, boys.
257000	262000	Let me ask you a little- I play games and I do pottery.
262000	264000	Let's talk about games for a minute.
264000	265000	Do pottery, not pot.
265000	269000	We were talking a little bit before the show and you mentioned you have a love of Silent
269000	270000	Hill.
270000	271000	Oh, yes.
271000	272000	Yes.
272000	274000	It's going to be really fun for us here at OLR.
274000	276000	What's your favorite out of the series?
276000	279000	Ooh, it's kind of a toss up.
279000	283000	I kind of like 3 and 4.
283000	287000	I love 4 for its story more than its gameplay aspects.
287000	288000	Interesting.
288000	290000	You don't hear a lot of people sticking up for 4.
290000	293000	I think 4 was better than people say it was.
293000	294000	It was intriguing.
294000	296000	But weird that you didn't say 2.
296000	299000	I can't get past the voice acting.
300000	304000	Did you ever try that Silent Hill HD collection where they redid it all?
304000	305000	No.
305000	308000	I haven't played it either because my understanding is they somehow made it worse.
308000	310000	So, I don't know.
310000	311000	Go with that.
311000	312000	What other games do you play?
312000	313000	What other games do you like?
313000	314000	What are you a fan of?
314000	317000	I've been playing a lot of Portal recently.
317000	320000	I love Portal, but it's really on my 4-year-old nephew's account too.
320000	325000	He's a huge fan of Portal 2 and that is literally the first thing out of his mouth any time
325000	327000	he comes over to visit.
327000	328000	I've got that pretty much.
328000	330000	I could navigate that in my sleep.
330000	331000	Nice.
331000	334000	No wonder you and Jamie get along.
334000	337000	She would not shut up about Portal until she discovered Mass Effect.
337000	338000	Yeah.
338000	339000	So, now I've got to get her.
339000	340000	Oh, God.
340000	341000	Did she suck you into that too?
341000	342000	Not yet.
342000	343000	I've been telling her about it.
343000	344000	I've got Becky.
344000	347000	Becky's already beaten the third game now.
347000	348000	Wait a minute.
348000	349000	She's playing through Leviathan now.
349000	351000	Did Becky play a lot of video games before?
351000	352000	No.
352000	353000	None.
353000	356000	I should tell her that we're talking about her because she's actually making dinner for
356000	357000	Julian right now.
357000	358000	Oh, okay.
358000	362000	But she's like, I found out that the controllers are ergonomic.
362000	363000	They don't hurt.
363000	366000	So, she's been playing through everything on Xbox 360.
366000	368000	I figured it out.
368000	372000	Mass Effect 3, or Mass Effect the series, is like Fifty Shades of Grey.
372000	375000	It's like Fifty Shades of Garris.
375000	376000	Fifty Shades of Garris.
376000	378000	There you go.
378000	379000	A.K.A.
379000	381000	Turian Pene.
381000	383000	Shade 1, calibrations.
383000	385000	Shade 2, more calibrations.
385000	386000	Shade 3.
386000	387000	Can you come back later?
387000	390000	I'm trying to do some calibration.
390000	395000	No, but I'm actually super looking forward to Omega.
395000	397000	You have to play Mass Effect.
397000	398000	The first one's free.
398000	401000	Go into our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com where you can participate.
401000	403000	A supporter, Rachel, in the chatroom.
403000	405000	Shane Olenko says, yay, someone else likes 4.
405000	406000	4 was awesome.
406000	408000	4 was pretty cool.
408000	410000	Shane is a huge Silent Hill fan.
410000	411000	So, let's see.
411000	412000	Enact Deft.
412000	413000	Portal is the most fun.
413000	414000	Portal is the most fun.
414000	417000	Portal 2 is the best.
417000	420000	Those two statements contradict each other in an oddly positive way.
420000	421000	I like it.
421000	422000	I like it.
422000	426000	Tigerclaw says, I don't even want to know what Turian Vag looks like.
426000	429000	You'll find out in the Omega DLC this week.
429000	435000	Actually, there is an artist that I follow that did a very, very good comic called First Contact.
435000	439000	It's about the whole, you know, Shepard Garris.
439000	441000	It's not like First Contact with her butt, is it?
441000	442000	No.
442000	445000	No, it's Turian Pain.
445000	450000	But anyway, she also did a series of drawings of what she thinks the Vag of other species looks like.
450000	451000	Why?
451000	453000	Why, why, why?
453000	456000	Because inquiring minds want to know.
456000	461000	But the thing is, she's actually a super, super good artist.
461000	464000	And that's what she spends her talents on.
464000	466000	So her work is actually rather realistic.
466000	468000	And it would make logical sense.
468000	470000	Oh my god.
470000	471000	I can't.
471000	475000	Did someone say portfolio?
475000	480000	Anyhow, let me bring up another random comment in the chat room to try and stir this conversation in a different direction.
480000	482000	I'm going to bring up another game I know you told me about earlier, Rachel.
482000	486000	Brad from Pod Culture says, ooh, Steam has Arkham City for $7.50.
486000	490000	That's another game series you said you were into, right?
490000	491000	Oh, yes, yes.
491000	497000	As a matter of fact, first time I installed Arkham Asylum, I did one complete playthrough throughout two days
497000	504000	because I didn't want to have to, you know, yeah, I installed it and then I didn't register it or whatever.
504000	505000	So I couldn't save it.
505000	508000	So I basically just played the thing for two days straight.
508000	511000	And then Arkham City came out, I played that thing into the ground.
511000	515000	And like, I'm, you know, I come from a family of completionists.
515000	519000	So it's like I was in there doing like every single Riddler challenge.
519000	521000	And oh my god, I lost so much sleep.
521000	524000	It's like I could feel my eyes just ready to fall out of my skull at that point.
524000	525000	But you did it.
525000	527000	Did you do all the DLC too?
527000	529000	No, no, I'm saving those for a special occasion.
529000	531000	And you haven't really finished it.
531000	532000	I know.
532000	533000	Twitch, Twitch, Twitch.
533000	534000	I was trying to see if I could get her to Twitch.
534000	536000	Were you a fan of the comics before playing the game?
536000	538000	Um, you know, not so much the comics.
538000	542000	I got into the games mainly because of the cartoon connection.
542000	544000	Kevin Conroy, awesome.
544000	545000	Ah, okay, the anime series.
545000	546000	Oh yeah.
546000	550000	And you know, him and Mark Hamill, they are basically Batman and the Joker for me.
550000	552000	It's all kinds of happies.
552000	554000	There's a lot of people on your team when it comes to that.
554000	555000	So, awesome.
555000	557000	Um, well, let's see.
557000	560000	I was mad at the DLC.
560000	561000	Huh.
561000	562000	I didn't play all the DLC.
562000	567000	Well, you know the thing with, um, okay, the game's been out forever so I'm just gonna freaking say it.
567000	569000	About, um, Harley.
569000	570000	Jump ahead, quick.
570000	571000	If you don't want spoilers, jump ahead.
571000	572000	Mute for one minute.
572000	574000	About Harley's pregnancy test.
574000	578000	And then, like, in the DLC there's like 20 bajillion of them that are all negative.
578000	583000	Oh, they're trying to fix that for a possible third game or something.
583000	586000	Except, like, there was the ending where she was singing a lullaby.
586000	588000	So, um, whatever.
588000	595000	Or, you know, that would be like a defining character moment where she thinks she's pregnant but she's really gone even crazier.
595000	597000	So it's like a Joker doll that she's calling her baby.
597000	600000	I kind of like if it would move in that direction.
600000	601000	Interesting.
601000	602000	Interesting.
602000	607000	She sounds like one of those crazy women, like the type that would draw vaginas of alien races and post them on her Tumblr.
607000	608000	You know what?
608000	610000	I linked the Tumblr in the chat room.
610000	611000	Oh, great.
611000	612000	Thank you, thank you so much for that.
612000	614000	I'm sure Loki's pulling it up right now.
614000	615000	Alright.
615000	623000	For the record, Rob, despite the comic being fairly graphic, it actually is very...
623000	624000	It's artsy.
624000	626000	It actually tells a story.
626000	627000	We'll leave it at that.
627000	628000	We'll leave it at that.
628000	633000	Alright, I would have to ask you before we move on to a real kickoff topic.
633000	635000	Rachel, what's your gaming platform of choice?
635000	639000	Do you have a particular console you tend to play stuff on or are you more PC gal?
639000	640000	Where do you lean?
640000	641000	Shiznite.
641000	642000	Shiznite.
642000	648000	You know, I tend to gravitate towards PC just because I'm big on retro games and a lot of emulators available there.
648000	649000	Ah, I see.
649000	655000	Yeah, but if you twist my arm and force me to pick, I'd have to go with a Nintendo console just out of sheer loyalty.
655000	656000	Oh, okay.
656000	657000	You're one of those.
657000	658000	No, I'm just kidding.
658000	659000	Yeah, I'm one of those.
659000	660000	Loki will love you.
660000	661000	Alright.
661000	664000	I don't know anything wrong with Nintendo consoles.
664000	668000	Just, you know, the Wii U's just not worth the money.
668000	674000	Well, we'll get into plenty more of that in a minute, but I did want to talk about some other kickoff topics here real quick.
674000	681000	Obviously, we hope all you guys here in the States had a happy Thanksgiving holiday, you know, and around the world.
681000	682000	Hope you had a good week.
682000	685000	Obviously, retail madness over the weekend.
685000	688000	I kind of hate that that stuff is starting to eclipse Thanksgiving.
688000	691000	I think a lot of people are growing very frustrated with it.
691000	697000	But it is the time to get some good deals and the Steam sale, obviously, is another good place to get deals.
697000	702000	Civ V, which I never showed up about on this show, great deal going on right now.
702000	705000	I was really tempted to get Borderlands 2, which I know is on sale.
705000	710000	I'm curious if you guys picked up any gaming deals over these past few days.
710000	711000	Oh, yes.
711000	712000	What'd you get?
712000	713000	What'd you get, Dark Sakura?
713000	716000	I bought They Bleed Pixels and Awesomenauts.
716000	723000	And then I bought Dragon Age Origins, the deluxe edition through Origin, although I wish I'd waited and just gotten it through Steam.
723000	725000	Because Steam was a penny cheaper.
725000	726000	One whole penny?
726000	729000	But I hate Origin. I prefer playing through Steam.
729000	734000	And then I actually just bought Sonic Generations on Steam, because it's eight freaking bucks.
734000	736000	And it's Sonic Generations.
736000	740000	With a really screwed up last level, seriously.
740000	743000	Because Dan and I sat and watched the whole playthrough.
743000	744000	Nice.
744000	747000	Rachel, did you take advantage of any of the gaming deals this weekend?
747000	748000	I did not.
748000	754000	I was actually working through Black Friday, even though it wasn't really Black Friday-ish for our shop.
754000	759000	I still saw a bit of ugliness, so I was more preoccupied with the working part of that.
759000	761000	That's fair enough. Fair enough. It happens.
761000	770000	You brave, brave retail people that had to work those front lines on Friday, I don't envy you in the slightest, because people are crazy.
770000	775000	Although, I was telling you guys before the show, I went out on Black Friday at about eight o'clock at night.
775000	778000	Because we needed stuff from Target. I needed shampoo.
778000	781000	So we went to Target at eight o'clock. It's fine.
781000	784000	We go out at night on Black Friday and after all the crazies have gone to bed.
784000	786000	Totally fine. Just like any other day.
786000	790000	Even went to Fry's and got some upgrades for the studio I'll talk about in a minute.
790000	792000	Loki, did you take advantage of any deals?
792000	796000	I bought nothing because I have no money to buy things with.
796000	799000	That's what happens when you're a parent. You have no money.
799000	803000	I don't think it's just being a parent. You're also a homeowner and you just bought a new car.
803000	805000	That's a big one.
805000	809000	I don't know. I just feel like giving people crap for small reasons.
809000	812000	Congrats on the used car.
812000	817000	And also the other thing too, the last Steam sale I bought a bunch of games.
817000	819000	I still haven't played most of them.
819000	822000	And I haven't played most of the games that I got through my Humble Bundle.
822000	824000	So I'm just kind of like, hey, that's cool.
824000	827000	Borderlands 2 is down to like 30 bucks, whatever.
827000	829000	Am I really going to play it? Probably not.
829000	834000	So it's just kind of answering the question, is this really something I'm going to play?
834000	837000	And a lot of times it's no, I'm probably not going to play that.
837000	840000	So that's why I haven't really been buying anything.
840000	843000	I didn't really buy anything either.
843000	847000	I did buy another Wii U game when I was at Fry's picking up the new router.
847000	855000	I got Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed for the Wii U just because some of my other friends had it and was giving it positive reviews.
855000	860000	It's only a deal because it's one of the two non $60 games, I think.
860000	861000	I think $50.
861000	863000	It's $40 actually.
863000	865000	So I think I paid $40 for it.
865000	867000	Maybe I did get a deal and didn't realize it.
867000	868000	Yeah, I think I only paid $40 for it.
868000	872000	And I might have been a deal then because I think that was supposed to be like a $50 game.
872000	874000	And I did get a deal.
874000	876000	Yeah, I only paid $40 for it, I'm pretty sure.
876000	878000	So that's pretty cool.
878000	881000	And there was one other game that was cheaper than the others.
881000	883000	I don't remember what it was.
883000	885000	Oh, well.
885000	888000	Anyhow, let's talk about, since we are talking about the games we got deals on,
888000	892000	let's talk about our actual gaming weeks and the games we've been playing this week.
892000	894000	Dark Sakura, why don't you start?
894000	896000	Mass Effect 3.
896000	899000	I beat 2. I'm on 3 again for like my fifth playthrough.
899000	904000	My fifth playthrough in what, four months?
904000	908000	And I actually touched some WoW.
908000	911000	So you guys wouldn't kick me out of the guild.
911000	914000	Going back to Mass Effect a minute, I mean obviously you've talked tons about it on the show,
914000	917000	but I found the modding you were doing this week interesting.
917000	921000	Because you were posting to our little rabid fan community we have on Facebook.
921000	924000	And you had like these different colored skinned shepherds.
924000	928000	Like you went in and had like a green skinned shepherd and this weird stuff.
928000	930000	Okay, I'll tell you where this came about.
930000	936000	And this is actually me using a little bit of what I've actually learned in college about colors.
936000	942000	And trying to make, I'm trying to actually match Zaid's skin tone.
942000	947000	But a little bit lighter because I'm trying to get that, it's actually closer to Aller's.
947000	949000	Because I want that kind of golden skin tone.
949000	952000	I'm working on making a somewhat middle eastern looking shepherd.
952000	956000	And I've tweaked the eyes, I've tweaked the nose, and now I'm tweaking the skin tone.
956000	961000	But it's either coming out like too much of a muted chocolate.
961000	965000	You know, like the plain milk chocolate with no extra skin tone to it.
965000	967000	Nothing blushing, nothing under that.
967000	970000	And so I'm playing with blushes, I'm playing with all this.
970000	972000	And then I had an idea.
972000	978000	I was like, well if all of this is showing through whatever the skin is, can I make a blue shepherd?
978000	982000	So I changed all the values to blue.
982000	985000	Which is 255 blue, 0 red, 0 green.
985000	987000	Blue shepherd.
987000	988000	It worked.
988000	989000	So then I did red shepherd.
989000	990000	Then I did green shepherd.
990000	993000	Then I did yellow shepherd, which looks more like puke green shepherd.
993000	995000	But I could get it to work.
995000	997000	Because I've gotten purple hair.
997000	998000	The hair works.
998000	1003000	Congratulations for now fusing the fan communities of Avatar and Mass Effect.
1003000	1006000	There already were blue people in Mass Effect though.
1006000	1007000	There were a sorry.
1007000	1010000	It doesn't matter, you don't need more blue people.
1010000	1013000	But I was actually planning on giving her white hair.
1013000	1017000	And then making her blue and calling her, you know, shepherd smurf.
1017000	1018000	But no.
1018000	1022000	But I mean that means I could play through my whole game with a blue shepherd.
1022000	1031000	And I went back to, and I got a really nice skin tone that unfortunately only looks really nice in bright light.
1031000	1034000	It's the picture that I posted from the Citadel where she looked kind of badass.
1034000	1039000	And I've modified my coalesced ion eye to add extra outfits.
1039000	1041000	There is a naked skin for female shepherd.
1041000	1044000	However, she has no real butt crack.
1045000	1048000	There's a naked one for the guys but I can't find it.
1048000	1050000	What is it with the girls in the nudity tonight?
1050000	1054000	It's no problem. You can fix that butt crack problem by just editing the texture.
1054000	1056000	There actually is an edited texture.
1056000	1059000	Buy her bigger panties. That's how you fix the butt crack problem.
1059000	1064000	It's like there's no bits to show and no coloration in certain places.
1064000	1066000	And someone has made, by the way.
1066000	1070000	I found that ages ago but I didn't know that it actually was based off of real texture.
1070000	1072000	And you can unlock the texture and it's like okay whatever.
1072000	1074000	And who'd have thunk it? It's the person that draws the vaginas.
1074000	1077000	No, it's not the same person.
1077000	1079000	It's not the same person.
1079000	1086000	But there's actually, did you know that there are two different fabric textures for the underwear?
1086000	1088000	There's shiny and matte.
1088000	1091000	I just learned something that I never thought I'd ever know in my life.
1091000	1095000	But I've had my shepherd running around in an all black uniform.
1095000	1099000	You know, it's actually black and a lighter black for the camo.
1099000	1108000	I have seen some hilarious gifs on Tumblr of, I guess there's a way to hack it so that you can play male shepherd in his underwear through the whole game.
1108000	1115000	And there's some hilarious gifs of like, you know, male shepherd like jumping out of a starship and he's like in his underwear.
1115000	1117000	It looks really funny.
1117000	1126000	No, you can actually, in the coalesced I&I, because basically all you do, you can add lines to have it pull different textures for different outfits.
1126000	1130000	So you can actually wear armor in casual look and wear casual clothes into armor.
1130000	1135000	There's also a way to use Ashley's clothes, but I went and looked through the actual meshes.
1135000	1140000	The reason why there's a big problem with people using Ashley's face is first of all, it's fully colored.
1140000	1146000	So if you have it over a colored face already, it's going to show up orange and part of her chest is rendered.
1146000	1151000	So you'd actually get shepherd with a hole in her chest if you try to use Ashley's clothes with no boobs pretty much.
1151000	1152000	Oh boy. All right.
1152000	1154000	Yeah, this is what I spent all week doing.
1154000	1157000	You're going to need your own podcast about Mass Effect at some point.
1157000	1158000	Just wait.
1158000	1159000	All right. Moving on.
1159000	1160000	But I did play another game.
1160000	1161000	Oh, what else?
1161000	1162000	Dragon Age Origins.
1162000	1166000	And I made a Dalish, which I sometimes want to call a Danish.
1166000	1168000	She's a redhead, kind of cool.
1168000	1172000	And I don't know that I like the game so much yet, but I'm going to give it a try.
1172000	1178000	You know, it might be one of those games that, you know, I didn't really love it the first time I played it, but I went back later and I liked it a little more.
1178000	1181000	Like it's just kind of sometimes games don't really hit you the first time.
1181000	1183000	I'm just really not a big fan of combat in it.
1183000	1187000	But I might go back and see about getting Dragon Age 2.
1187000	1188000	Gotcha.
1188000	1196000	I mean, which I started playing on Xbox 360 and got pretty far in until that stupid battle where Fenris is like, I'm going to be emo and kill you.
1196000	1199000	Now, see, that's really weird because most of the fandom really doesn't like Dragon Age 2.
1199000	1202000	But it plays like Mass Effect.
1202000	1205000	I mean, really, I like the way it plays. It handles like Mass Effect.
1205000	1209000	That's why I could get into Mass Effect so easily is because it handled the same way.
1209000	1212000	Well, you know, there's a third one coming out. Maybe it'll be somewhere in the middle.
1212000	1213000	Maybe.
1213000	1214000	Let's see. All right.
1214000	1216000	And I played very solitaire.
1216000	1217000	Of course you did. Of course you did.
1217000	1218000	It sucks.
1218000	1219000	All right. Let me move on.
1219000	1222000	Rachel, since you're our guest, why don't you go next?
1222000	1224000	What kind of games, what's gaming week look like for you?
1224000	1229000	You know, since school is on, you know, I have a lot of time preoccupied just by schoolwork.
1229000	1233000	So the only time I really get to play games is when the kids are around.
1233000	1239000	So it's, you know, more cinematic stuff like Pikmin, Portal 2, things with a lot of really bright characters.
1239000	1244000	I am, you know, I am really, you know, I could never get enough replaying of Portal 2, though,
1244000	1247000	just because the mythos behind it is so fascinating.
1247000	1250000	Because I'm a writer. I'm not sure if you knew that.
1250000	1251000	I just learned something.
1251000	1252000	There you go.
1252000	1254000	The more you know.
1254000	1255000	Yeah.
1255000	1260000	So, and I just, you know, there's, I find something new in every single replay.
1260000	1263000	Like, there's always one more secret door I haven't gone through.
1263000	1267000	There's one more connection to Half-Life and just, you know, the way they paint their characters.
1267000	1269000	It's, everything's pretty three-dimensional.
1269000	1271000	So I appreciate it on a couple different levels.
1271000	1273000	You should talk to Alan about Half-Life at some point.
1273000	1274000	I was going to say, are you a big Half-Life fan as well?
1274000	1276000	You know, I haven't gotten into it yet.
1276000	1282000	I'm, you know, I'm saving up a big chunk of time where I can just play, blow through the entire series so far.
1282000	1284000	Now's a great time with the Black Mesa source being out there.
1284000	1285000	Definitely look that up.
1285000	1287000	I am. I'm going to blow through it.
1287000	1289000	Then I can get pissed off that there's not an episode two.
1292000	1293000	All right.
1293000	1296000	Well, if that's all you want to share about your week, then I'll move on to Loki.
1296000	1297000	How was your gaming week?
1297000	1300000	I played Black Ops 2 a bit.
1300000	1302000	That was fun.
1302000	1306000	And then a little bit of Modern Warfare 3, although this week we should be switching over to Black Ops 2.
1306000	1309000	Just waiting for our copies from Activision to come in.
1309000	1312000	And then a lot of Minecraft.
1312000	1319000	Just been working on trying to set up the rest of the mob arena and also some other stuff.
1319000	1329000	Because the website I had set up had went down because the free URL forwarding company, co.cc, went under.
1329000	1333000	And all the, like, five million domains that they had are poof, gone.
1333000	1335000	So I actually got a legit domain now.
1335000	1339000	So it's now at vog-minecraft.com.
1339000	1341000	And there's not really anything there other than the map right now.
1341000	1344000	But eventually there'll be something there.
1344000	1345000	So I put that in our chat room.
1345000	1347000	Vog-minecraft.com.
1347000	1350000	And there's also a Twitter account to go along with that.
1350000	1353000	So, vog-minecraft at Twitter.
1353000	1354000	Look at you!
1354000	1355000	So, yeah.
1355000	1356000	That's great.
1356000	1357000	And, yeah.
1357000	1361000	So I've been kind of busy with stuff this week.
1361000	1364000	And then hopefully I'll get working on the website soon.
1364000	1367000	I don't really know what I want to do with it, but I've got it for a while.
1367000	1369000	So we'll play around with that.
1369000	1372000	And then, what else did I do this week?
1372000	1373000	I don't think I played anything else.
1373000	1374000	No, that was it.
1374000	1376000	That was all I played.
1376000	1380000	I actually had a lot of time to play some games thanks to the holiday break.
1380000	1384000	And I didn't have too much going on outside of Thanksgiving Day itself.
1384000	1387000	Obviously I've been able to spend more time with the Wii U.
1387000	1390000	Because on the last show it was launch day.
1390000	1392000	I had only really spent like an hour with it.
1392000	1395000	So now I've been able to spend some quality time with the Wii U.
1395000	1397000	And I've played three different games on the Wii U.
1397000	1399000	And two of them are the ones that everybody's been playing.
1399000	1401000	I'll talk first about Nintendo Land.
1401000	1404000	Nintendo Land is a collection of mini-games, basically.
1404000	1408000	I think it's framed a lot better than Wii Sports was.
1408000	1412000	I think Monita, though, as a character will get a little bit irritating to some people.
1412000	1419000	But she serves her purpose, especially for trying to get those that are not as familiar with how to play a video game acquainted with the games.
1419000	1422000	There are some pretty neat games in there.
1422000	1427000	I think I like the mini-games in it more than I like Wii Sports.
1427000	1428000	Because let's be real.
1428000	1431000	At the end of the day, Wii Tennis was about flailing.
1431000	1433000	There wasn't a lot of skill to it.
1433000	1435000	There wasn't a lot that went into it.
1435000	1438000	It was just like imagination with the help of this controller.
1438000	1440000	Wii Bowling was slightly a little better.
1440000	1442000	You felt like you were a little more in control of your actions.
1442000	1445000	But it was kind of, eh, at the end of the day as well.
1445000	1447000	I mean, Wii Sports, when all is said and done,
1447000	1449000	I know not everybody's going to agree with this comment.
1449000	1452000	I understand why it ends up on the top 100 gaming list and all that.
1452000	1454000	It was a very influential game.
1454000	1456000	I don't think Wii Sports is actually a really good game.
1456000	1459000	Especially if you're more of a hardcore gamer.
1459000	1460000	It's really not a good game.
1460000	1463000	It's a great technological feat.
1463000	1465000	But it's not really a good game.
1465000	1468000	I like Nintendo Land because as a gamer,
1468000	1471000	I feel like there's more game in it.
1471000	1474000	There's more to actually achieve.
1474000	1477000	The Metroid Blast was fun.
1477000	1481000	The F-Zero Race, it's certainly not F-Zero,
1481000	1483000	but it's simple enough.
1483000	1487000	Kind of like Atari 2600 basic, but all of these modern graphics.
1487000	1488000	It's fun.
1488000	1492000	The Donkey Kong course is surprisingly,
1492000	1496000	like, it's like one of those Mega Man hard games
1496000	1498000	and all it is is tilting.
1498000	1500000	But it's surprisingly quite a bit of fun.
1500000	1503000	And some of the different mini games,
1503000	1505000	especially in a party environment,
1505000	1510000	the Mario Chase, the Animal Crossing, Luigi's Mansion, all hilarious.
1510000	1513000	We played those on Thanksgiving Day and they were all just a ton of fun.
1513000	1516000	I think Mario Chase was my personal favorite out of the bunch,
1516000	1519000	though Luigi's Mansion is really good as well,
1519000	1521000	and Animal Crossing is its own thing.
1521000	1524000	But, I mean, at its core,
1524000	1528000	those three games are all kind of chase games.
1528000	1531000	They're just like a different twist on the chase element.
1531000	1534000	Like in Luigi's Mansion, you're hidden
1534000	1537000	and you're trying to grab the others before they grab you.
1537000	1540000	In Mario Chase, they're just trying to grab you.
1540000	1542000	In Animal Crossing, you control two people
1542000	1544000	and there's the whole eating the pellets.
1544000	1547000	I mean, I guess it's a little more different.
1547000	1550000	Tigerclaw brings up in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com,
1550000	1553000	what about that Pachinko in Nintendo Land, the Pachinko game?
1553000	1556000	I call it Plinko, but yeah, it's pretty much the same thing.
1556000	1558000	Because, you know, they're pretty much the same thing.
1558000	1559000	Pa-plinko?
1559000	1560000	No, Plinko.
1560000	1561000	I know, I was saying Pa-plinko.
1561000	1562000	Pa-plinko?
1562000	1563000	Instead of Pachinko, Pa-plinko.
1563000	1565000	Pa-plinko? Yeah, okay, that works.
1565000	1568000	But there's a Pa-plinko game you play to get the unlocks,
1568000	1569000	but, eh, I could give or take it.
1569000	1572000	The unlock is a little bit silly.
1572000	1575000	But as a pack-in game, overall, it's fine.
1575000	1578000	I would see myself revisiting this game
1578000	1582000	far more than I would revisit Wii Sports.
1582000	1587000	Mario U, Super Mario Wii U, is great.
1587000	1590000	It's HD Mario, it's what you'd expect.
1590000	1593000	What I love about it is that it's not just a game
1593000	1595000	with the depth of Super Mario World,
1595000	1598000	but it has all these little extra modes as well
1598000	1601000	to kind of enhance it, like the course
1601000	1603000	for get from start to finish
1603000	1606000	by getting the least number of coins possible,
1606000	1609000	or speed runs, or all these other types of twists
1609000	1610000	that are built into it.
1610000	1612000	And supposedly, it has some type of spot pass feature.
1612000	1614000	I don't know if it's going to have leaderboards or what.
1614000	1616000	But even if it didn't have all that,
1616000	1618000	I like playing those little side missions as well.
1618000	1621000	The difficulty level of the game ramps up surprisingly quick,
1621000	1623000	and there's some really hard stuff.
1623000	1625000	I had to use an FAQ to get past one of the levels.
1625000	1627000	I couldn't find the stinking door out of the ghost house.
1627000	1629000	And then come to find out, there's like a second one
1629000	1631000	I probably would have never have found.
1631000	1637000	So I'm liking Mario Wii U as a really solid Mario game,
1637000	1641000	even more than I think the one that was previously out on Wii,
1641000	1642000	Wii Regular.
1642000	1644000	And I don't know if that's just because
1644000	1646000	the huge step up in the graphics or what.
1646000	1648000	The only negatives I can see to the game?
1648000	1649000	Go ahead.
1649000	1651000	I'm sorry, just what popped right into my head
1651000	1652000	when you said Wii Regular.
1652000	1653000	What?
1653000	1654000	Does that mean that the Wii U needs fiber?
1654000	1655000	Stop.
1655000	1656000	All right.
1656000	1660000	The screen doesn't do a lot for Mario.
1660000	1662000	It does in multiplayer, as I understand,
1662000	1664000	because you can create blocks and all that stuff.
1664000	1667000	But as a single player, all the screen does
1667000	1669000	is mirror what's on your TV.
1669000	1673000	If you want to do the whole I play something on my Wii U
1673000	1675000	while you watch something on TV, that's great.
1675000	1677000	If you have control of your TV,
1677000	1679000	it doesn't really add a lot to the experience.
1679000	1681000	Luckily, it's a gorgeous game to look at,
1681000	1684000	even with all the little touches in the background.
1684000	1686000	They have little dancing Miis that show up in the background and stuff.
1686000	1688000	Just all these little touches that are really cool.
1688000	1692000	And the sound thing that I really hyped up last week is great.
1692000	1696000	The surround sound it kind of creates
1696000	1699000	between the pad and the regular stereo is pretty cool.
1699000	1701000	So, yeah, Mario is solid,
1701000	1703000	and I'm sure most people that will get a Wii U
1703000	1706000	will pick this game up, and it makes sense.
1706000	1707000	Absolutely.
1709000	1711000	One other game I've been playing on the Wii U
1711000	1713000	that was one of the launch titles.
1713000	1717000	Sonic Racing, no, Sonic All-Stars Racing Transformed,
1717000	1719000	which is a game that's actually on the Xbox 360
1719000	1721000	and the PlayStation 3 as well.
1721000	1723000	They also have the Wii U version.
1723000	1725000	This is the game we've been talking about on the show.
1725000	1727000	We've kind of been joking about it and having fun with it
1727000	1730000	because it has Danica Patrick very randomly as a character.
1730000	1732000	It's an amazing eyeliner.
1732000	1735000	And Wreck-It Ralph, and all these other Sega characters,
1735000	1738000	like Metal Sonic, Beat,
1738000	1741000	one of the taxi cab drivers from Crazy Taxi,
1741000	1744000	supposedly Alex Kidd gets unlocked at some point.
1744000	1750000	I'm really surprised at how much I'm enjoying this game.
1750000	1753000	And I took a look at some of the reviews online
1753000	1755000	and some of the talk in Miiverse and so forth,
1755000	1758000	and a lot of people razzing it for being buggy,
1758000	1762000	and I will admit there's been some odd collision detection things,
1762000	1765000	but nothing that detracted from the experience so much.
1765000	1767000	I was, like, hating the game.
1767000	1769000	In fact, I found myself most of the time
1769000	1772000	actually really impressed with some of the level design.
1772000	1775000	The stages are all huge stages,
1775000	1780000	and they will seamlessly go from go-karting to flying a plane,
1780000	1783000	and Danica Patrick's car turns into, like, an afterburner jet,
1783000	1786000	which is kind of funny, and on the water,
1786000	1789000	and it kind of just seamlessly transitions between all these different phases.
1789000	1791000	And I was liking it.
1791000	1793000	I was showing you girls before the show tonight,
1793000	1796000	I showed you the Skies of Arcadia level,
1796000	1798000	and you saw how, like, you'll do the first lap
1798000	1802000	and then in the second lap, the pirate ships, like, start attacking the town
1802000	1804000	and are blowing up the road and all this stuff,
1804000	1806000	and there's a lot going on.
1806000	1808000	I was really into it.
1808000	1810000	I got to admit, I'm kind of liking this game,
1810000	1813000	I think, a little more than the online impressions.
1813000	1816000	I mean, it's got not just a regular mode,
1816000	1818000	but all these, like, special little games in it,
1818000	1820000	like boost mode and kill the other people first,
1820000	1822000	and there's a battle mode.
1822000	1825000	You can play it online on the Wii U.
1825000	1827000	Apparently, the advantage that the Wii U has over the other versions
1827000	1831000	is that the Wii U is up to five players, thanks to the second screen.
1831000	1835000	It's not just a copy of the first screen in single-player mode
1835000	1837000	unless you want it to be.
1837000	1839000	If you swipe the screen, you get a copy of the TV,
1839000	1842000	but if you don't, you get a rear-view mirror and a map,
1842000	1845000	you know, kind of what you'd expect in your racing game on the second screen.
1845000	1848000	So, yeah, I was really surprised.
1848000	1850000	I was kind of like playing it going,
1850000	1855000	you know, Sega did help with that F-Zero game that was on the GameCube,
1855000	1858000	and I got to say, this feels like kind of the closest thing
1858000	1860000	I'm going to get to an F-Zero game for a little while,
1860000	1863000	unless maybe they're going to work on it, which I really hope they do.
1863000	1864000	Sugar Rush.
1864000	1866000	Or, yeah, or just flat out do a Sugar Rush game.
1866000	1868000	Sugar Rush.
1868000	1871000	It's weird because the Wreck-It Ralph thing, like, I don't,
1871000	1875000	I mean, it's cool that Wreck-It Ralph and Danica Patrick are in there, I guess,
1875000	1877000	but there's not really a lot else.
1877000	1880000	Like, you don't have the Sugar Rush stage, or at least I haven't got it yet,
1880000	1883000	or any of that, so it's interesting.
1883000	1886000	Going to some of the comments from our chatters at live.vognetwork.com,
1886000	1889000	Tigerclaw says, the new Sonic racing game is a lot of fun,
1889000	1891000	but boy, it gets pretty hard when doing the medium difficulty
1891000	1893000	on many of the races and difficulty.
1893000	1896000	I can't get past the drift challenges on medium.
1896000	1900000	Yeah, I can do some of it on medium, but, like, the boost challenge,
1900000	1903000	I couldn't even do that on regular.
1903000	1905000	And here's a little tip for anybody struggling with a game.
1905000	1909000	If you flop on a stage four times, it'll let you just skip it on the map.
1909000	1912000	So, you know, but you'll still need stars.
1912000	1914000	You'll have to compensate the stars from somewhere else
1914000	1917000	in order to be able to get the unlock, so I don't know.
1917000	1921000	Tigerclaw suggests that maybe some of the Wreck-It Ralph stuff will be DLC.
1921000	1923000	Well, I don't know how the Wii U is going to handle that,
1923000	1926000	and I will say that part of it kind of concerns me
1926000	1929000	that the Wii U doesn't seem to have a DLC system in place.
1929000	1932000	It's the reason I haven't picked up Mass Effect 3
1932000	1935000	is I hear that none of the multiplayer enhancements
1935000	1937000	they've done since launch are available.
1937000	1939000	And I'm like, well, then what's the friggin' point?
1939000	1942000	Like, part of the reason the Mass Effect 3 multiplayer is so amazing
1942000	1945000	is because of all the constant DLC they've been putting out.
1945000	1948000	And I understand that some of the single-player DLC is included,
1948000	1950000	but they're not going to get Omega. Why?
1950000	1952000	Because Nintendo can't do DLC yet.
1952000	1956000	Or if they can, they're not doing it a lot or something. I don't know.
1956000	1960000	So that part of it, with all the positive I'm saying about the Wii U
1960000	1963000	and overall I am satisfied with my purchase,
1963000	1968000	I would be in love with my purchase if some of these other things were corrected.
1968000	1973000	But, I don't know, Nintendo has, over the past week,
1973000	1975000	been building a lot into the system.
1975000	1979000	We got, over the past week, we got the Netflix, the Amazon, the YouTube,
1979000	1983000	the Hulu, and all that showed up, like, you know, just day after day after day.
1983000	1986000	And I gotta say, the YouTube app in particular,
1986000	1990000	very different look from the other, the PS3 and the Xbox ones.
1990000	1991000	It's not bad.
1991000	1992000	Bobby said he didn't care for it, right?
1992000	1993000	Huh?
1993000	1994000	Bobby said he didn't care for it, right?
1994000	1996000	I don't remember what he said about YouTube,
1996000	2000000	but the look of it is weird because it doesn't really have any Nintendo branding
2000000	2002000	and it doesn't really have Microsoft or something.
2002000	2006000	It's just, it's kind of different and it works pretty well,
2006000	2008000	especially if you're logged in.
2008000	2011000	I enjoyed it more than the Xbox version of it,
2011000	2017000	even though it functions similarly, but it still felt easier to use
2017000	2019000	and maybe part of that is having the touch pad, I don't know.
2019000	2021000	But, yeah.
2021000	2022000	I don't know.
2022000	2025000	Tiger Claw on chat says Nintendo is just taking baby steps.
2025000	2028000	This is a whole new thing for them, the online community.
2028000	2032000	Well, yes, but at some point you have to stop letting that be an excuse.
2032000	2037000	And I think a lot of us have said, oh, Nintendo, you're just new to the party,
2037000	2038000	and so we forgive you.
2038000	2042000	And it's kind of like, okay, that's true, but it's not an excuse.
2042000	2046000	Like, playing catch-up, you know, you've had a lot of time to play catch-up.
2046000	2050000	You know, you should have thought about some of this during the Wii being out there.
2050000	2057000	But there's some parts about the Wii U like Miiverse is surprisingly interesting.
2057000	2060000	Like, it's actually something I keep going back to and looking at.
2060000	2063000	I like looking at the activity feed of my friends
2063000	2065000	and what they've been posting in the games.
2065000	2070000	The first-party games really urge you to make public posts in Miiverse to interact with,
2070000	2073000	and I find, like, I want to see what my friends are posting,
2073000	2076000	and the artwork people are doing is amazing.
2076000	2079000	And I don't know if you guys know this, but in the Wii U, when you turn it on,
2079000	2083000	if you have your Wii U always connected to the internet,
2083000	2088000	it downloads artwork from around, you know, the community,
2088000	2090000	like things that have been popular voted.
2090000	2093000	So when you turn on your Wii, you'll see a helping of, like, random games,
2093000	2096000	and then you'll see some of the popular comments.
2096000	2100000	And they're all these artwork that is, like, really well done and funny.
2100000	2106000	And so I find it really neat, and I don't know if this is what Nintendo intended,
2106000	2108000	but you've got to hand it to them.
2108000	2111000	This is something Microsoft and Sony aren't doing with their online,
2111000	2114000	so let's give Nintendo some credit here.
2114000	2120000	The first thing you get when you turn on your system is community.
2120000	2122000	You don't even get that with Xbox and Sony.
2122000	2124000	That's surprising.
2124000	2127000	So if there's one thing Nintendo is doing right when it comes to online,
2127000	2131000	community is the first thing you see.
2131000	2133000	Interesting.
2133000	2134000	Agreed.
2134000	2137000	Now, obviously, they have some slow steps in other places,
2137000	2139000	but that's one step in the right direction.
2139000	2143000	So going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
2143000	2145000	Raginator in chat says,
2145000	2148000	Interesting or just a novelty that you'll forget about in a month or two?
2148000	2150000	That's a very good question, Raginator,
2150000	2154000	and I think a lot of that depends on how well will the games in the future support it.
2154000	2156000	You know, and what else will come out?
2156000	2159000	What download content is going to come out?
2159000	2162000	You know, what's going to keep the people talking?
2162000	2165000	What's going to keep the people providing those funny pictures and so forth?
2165000	2169000	And will they allow you to add cat pics later on?
2169000	2173000	Well, apparently, like, people have been doing really random stuff.
2173000	2175000	Like, I was reading something on my Facebook.
2175000	2178000	The Destructoid community took over one of the,
2178000	2182000	I think it was the Rabbids game community with pictures of Willem Dafoe.
2182000	2184000	I don't know what the joke is there,
2184000	2186000	but, like, they were drawing Willem Dafoe and writing.
2186000	2190000	I mean, I don't, sorry, I don't have time to read every single website on the internet,
2190000	2193000	but, like, I thought it was funny that they're kind of, like, trying to do that.
2193000	2197000	But, you know, so yeah, people come up with their own ways to entertain themselves.
2197000	2203000	So it's turning into Game Facts, basically, where they'll take over, like, a message board.
2203000	2207000	I don't know how well they've succeeded, but yes, possibly.
2207000	2211000	Fantastic. That's what Nintendo needs is more Game Facts.
2211000	2212000	Mm-hmm.
2212000	2215000	Bobby in our chat room wants to clarify some stuff.
2215000	2219000	Blackwell says, okay, A, Nintendo has a DLC system in place.
2219000	2222000	New Super Mario Brothers U will have DLC, for instance.
2222000	2225000	Okay, that may be true, but where is it?
2225000	2227000	It's not here at launch.
2227000	2230000	That leaves me to think it's still being built.
2230000	2232000	Remember my Winchester House comparison from last week?
2232000	2234000	I think that's what's happening.
2234000	2238000	I don't have any proof, but at the same time, where is the DLC?
2238000	2240000	It's going to be there at launch.
2240000	2242000	Remember, they've got six more years.
2242000	2244000	Okay. Let's see.
2244000	2249000	And Blackwell said, B, I think YouTube videos look better in the internet browser than in the app.
2249000	2253000	And you can watch videos on the gamepad from the browser not available in the app.
2253000	2257000	Blackwell also clarifying, I guess he reads more destructively than I do.
2257000	2260000	Blackwell says, the initial joke was Jim Sterling said,
2260000	2263000	I am remaking the community to be about Willem Dafoe
2263000	2266000	because that's a better use of this community than the game.
2266000	2269000	The post got moderated away.
2269000	2273000	Did you not see how many people were pissed off at day one DLC?
2273000	2277000	How pissed would you be if there was day one DLC for New Super Mario Brothers U?
2277000	2283000	But Bobby, I am pissed off that there isn't day one DLC for the other games to play catch up,
2283000	2285000	especially when that DLC is free.
2285000	2290000	So in the case of Mass Effect 3, yes, I do feel like 100% of the game isn't there,
2290000	2293000	especially when you're trying to be competitive with these other consoles.
2293000	2298000	I get that some of the single player DLC, but when you're kind of trying to play catch up,
2298000	2302000	you know, I think that part is missing.
2302000	2306000	I get what you're saying about the whole, you don't want day one DLC for New Super Mario Brothers Wii U.
2306000	2311000	I get that, but that's also first party versus third party.
2311000	2315000	And, you know, maybe Nintendo hasn't built it because they don't need it for themselves yet,
2315000	2318000	so screw everybody else, I don't know.
2318000	2319000	Anyway.
2319000	2321000	Alright, I've talked enough about the Wii U.
2321000	2325000	Sorry guys, but it's with the hot thing that's going on in gaming right now.
2325000	2328000	The other thing I want to talk about in my gaming video, just real quick, I'll just throw this out there.
2328000	2332000	Despite the fact that I have a shiny new console, it doesn't mean I'm not going to play other stuff.
2332000	2335000	I've been participating in the Mass Effect 3 weekend challenge like a good player,
2335000	2341000	and I played an epic nine hour match of Civilization V, start to finish.
2341000	2344000	And I know some people are going only nine hours.
2344000	2346000	Yeah, we did kind of an easier skill level,
2346000	2350000	and we agreed the three of us that were playing would not military strike each other,
2350000	2351000	but it was a lot of fun.
2351000	2357000	It was my first Gods and Kings game, start to finish, so I was, you know, thankful I played it.
2357000	2362000	And I am still enjoying Civ V, and it's on sale right now on Steam,
2362000	2367000	and I would support a purchase of that if you wanted to do that.
2367000	2372000	So, all right. Anyhow, that is all I want to say about my gaming week.
2372000	2374000	Housekeeping tonight.
2374000	2378000	Obviously, we always like to plug our Twitter, twitter.com slash o-l-r, and our Facebook,
2378000	2383000	facebook.com slash orangelaungeradio, and our Google Plus, search for Orangelaungeradio.
2383000	2387000	Also, this one's for the live listeners, more so than the podcast listeners.
2387000	2391000	I'm hoping so far tonight, live listeners, we haven't had any dropouts on the feed.
2391000	2397000	I know the fact that the stream has been dropping out lately has been very frustrating,
2397000	2401000	and so we didn't really know if it was us or if it was the host,
2401000	2404000	but there's a good chance that it's us here in studio.
2404000	2410000	So what we did on Friday, Alan and I went out and we got a new router for the studio here.
2410000	2413000	So we have like a brand new, it's not like top of the line because I'm sorry,
2413000	2418000	I didn't have 200 bucks to drop on a router, but we did get one of those like, what is it, 600?
2418000	2422000	It's like 300 plus 300, it's a huge step up from what we had.
2422000	2427000	Our last router couldn't even do wireless end, so we did upgrade that.
2427000	2430000	We had this whole thing going on where you actually had two networks in the house,
2430000	2432000	and one was daisy chained to the other.
2432000	2436000	Now it's parent router and bridge.
2436000	2441000	I wrote a post in the VOG Network forums in more detail if you want to see all the parts there,
2441000	2446000	but I think so far the stream hasn't dropped, and the evil protagonist in our chat says,
2446000	2449000	sounds great tonight, so maybe it was us.
2449000	2454000	I didn't want to let that go forever without trying to fix it, so fingers crossed.
2454000	2456000	Now that I've talked about it, it's going to drop in the next two minutes.
2456000	2457000	Just watch.
2457000	2463000	But hey, that's better than 20 times during the show like last week, which was very, very frustrating.
2463000	2468000	So thank you to our loyal live listeners who have stuck it out throughout all those drops.
2468000	2470000	We're trying to make the situation better for you guys.
2470000	2472000	I hope it works tonight.
2473000	2477000	Yeah, Raginator brings up, you know, by bringing up the stream dropping, you just jinxed yourself.
2477000	2485000	Well, hey, you know what, we got through 48 minutes without one, which beats last week, so let's just hope.
2485000	2492000	Also, it's a slow news week tonight, you guys, with the holiday going on and everything here in the States,
2492000	2497000	but I will tease the coming up in Part B tonight, Match Game.
2497000	2500000	We haven't done Match Game in at least a year, so we're going to do Match Game tonight.
2500000	2504000	So we will have contestants, one via Skype, one via the chat.
2504000	2510000	So if you want to be potentially our Skype player, make sure you have Orange Lounge Radio all one word added on Skype.
2510000	2515000	Again, we're not doing that now. We'll get into it in Part B. I'll let you know when to call.
2515000	2518000	All right, let's move on into some gaming news.
2518000	2519000	All right.
2519000	2520000	All right.
2520000	2527000	So let's talk a little bit about this Xbox set-top box, which actually was a rumor that we've been hearing about for a while now,
2527000	2532000	where there is supposed to be some slimmed down Xbox system that the rumor was, I think, originally,
2532000	2539000	that it was only going to be able to play Xbox Live Arcade stuff, which would be a little weird, but I could see that.
2539000	2542000	I mean, they have a lot of the whole Xbox.
2542000	2544000	All the symphony of the night you can stand.
2544000	2548000	True. Or, you know, if this is going to be like-
2548000	2549000	So much Yaris.
2549000	2550000	If there's going to be-
2550000	2551000	I'm interested in this.
2551000	2556000	If there's going to be like a digital Xbox where it's not going to have a disk drive or something like that,
2556000	2559000	it's going to be built into a TV like as an app.
2559000	2562000	I could see it maybe like, you know, with games on demand stuff.
2562000	2565000	I was just about to say, couldn't they do games on demand still, though?
2565000	2566000	That's possible.
2566000	2570000	All it needs is a USB port and you can suddenly, oh, magical 64 gigs.
2570000	2577000	So they're saying, of course, anonymous sources are telling them that it's going to be dubbed Xbox TV.
2577000	2581000	It's going to support casual games and run on Windows 8.
2581000	2587000	I think it's just going to be kind of like running on, you know, the dashboard that's out there that kind of looks like Windows 8.
2587000	2593000	And I guess some sort of, you know, chips that is going to allow for quick boot ups and that kind of stuff.
2593000	2607000	And they're saying that it's also going to be able to kind of like, I don't know, maybe kind of incorporate, you know, surface stuff or smart glass or anything like that.
2607000	2613000	And I guess, you know, Microsoft made a statement regarding the set up box plans.
2613000	2624000	They're saying Xbox 360 has found new ways to extend the console lifecycle by introducing controller free experiences with Kinect and reinventing the console with a new dashboard, new entertainment content.
2624000	2629000	The typical bullshit line they're going to give when the Christmas season is going on and they don't want people to...
2629000	2632000	Yeah, we are always thinking about what is next for our platform.
2632000	2634000	In other words, yeah, that's probably going to be true.
2634000	2641000	Yeah, in other words, don't think about what's coming out next year. Think about putting a Kinect under your Christmas tree this year. That's exactly what it is.
2641000	2646000	I wouldn't put a Kinect under your Christmas tree unless you're into dancing games because all the games that have come out have been kind of crap.
2646000	2647000	You know what I mean.
2647000	2649000	I'm just saying, yeah.
2649000	2655000	Okay, here, okay, I know this is going to sound stupid and I'm going to sound like an idiot, but hear me out here.
2655000	2660000	Could this be a very corporate challenge to the Ouya?
2660000	2665000	And I know that comparison is really weird because I know the Ouya's whole thing is open source and all this.
2665000	2675000	But do you think still maybe Microsoft took a look at that whole thing and said, maybe people want a $99 thing they just took up to their TV and play games with.
2675000	2679000	And although we sure as hell aren't going to make it open source, maybe we'll make it look like a PC.
2679000	2682000	Is this maybe a response to the Ouya, if true?
2682000	2688000	Probably not. I don't think they feel any threat from the Ouya yet because there's no real system there.
2688000	2691000	I mean, you can't feel a threat about something that's not out yet.
2691000	2696000	Not a threat, but it's doing what Microsoft does, taking an idea and trying to make it better.
2696000	2697000	For better or for worse.
2697000	2708000	I think if anything, they would be kind of going with the whole, well, we've seen some of these integrated like, maybe even looking at Apple TV or something like that.
2708000	2714000	Obviously, they're just a step away from actually having a system that runs apps and stuff.
2715000	2719000	I don't know if it's really going to be anything.
2719000	2723000	I mean, because if you think about it, let's say this comes out a year from now.
2723000	2733000	Why would I want to buy a stripped down version of the Xbox 360 when the regular Xbox 360 is probably going to be under $100 or just about $100?
2733000	2736000	I mean, if you think about it, yes, you may not be able to get the brand new system that's out right now.
2736000	2740000	But those older systems, they're already at about $100 or just over $100.
2740000	2744000	So why would I want to, you know, put out something that's going to...
2744000	2748000	Maybe if it's one of those funky partnerships where it's all built into the TV.
2748000	2753000	But see, why would you buy something like that that's built into the TV?
2753000	2756000	Because why do people buy TVs with built-in Blu-ray players?
2756000	2759000	Why do people buy TVs with built-in Roku and so forth?
2759000	2762000	It's like those laserdisc players that had the Sega CD built in it.
2762000	2766000	It's dumb. You should never buy a TV with something built into it.
2766000	2768000	You know who buys that stuff? My parents.
2768000	2773000	Because they don't release it. They just want the damn thing to work.
2773000	2780000	This is what older people think about. Not to stereotype, but in my dealings with it, it's been true.
2780000	2783000	They don't have time to figure out how to hook it up.
2783000	2788000	They don't have all this. They want it to fucking work. That's it.
2788000	2792000	And so now maybe you're recognizing, if you're targeting casual games especially,
2792000	2799000	even though the thing might be capable of doing all this other stuff you're talking about with the more geometry wars and so forth,
2799000	2807000	maybe the push is to grandma who enjoys Farmville now maybe wants apples to apples on her TV.
2807000	2811000	Or whatever else Microsoft might reveal in the next year game-wise.
2811000	2815000	I gotta be honest though. If you're saying that that's the reason that people would buy these TVs,
2815000	2820000	I don't think those type of people would buy a web-enabled TV or anything like that.
2820000	2822000	Because it's too complicated for them.
2822000	2829000	Why spend the money to get this really expensive TV with a console built into it, like a gaming console,
2829000	2836000	that first off is gonna use these really complicated controllers that grandma's not gonna have any idea how to fucking navigate.
2836000	2842000	Well, because it won't just be a gaming console. It'll play the casual games.
2842000	2844000	But it's gonna have all of Microsoft's other stuff too.
2844000	2851000	It'll have all those channels with the built-in Hulu and the Netflix and all that same shit.
2851000	2856000	I just don't think they're gonna do that. The only reason I don't think they're gonna do that is because other people have done it better already.
2856000	2857000	And there's no reason to-
2857000	2859000	Why wouldn't they want a piece of it then?
2859000	2861000	Why wouldn't they want a piece of it? Because I don't think that they-
2861000	2865000	Has that worked out well for them in the whole mobile phone department?
2865000	2870000	Have they really taken a large chunk of the business from Android and iOS?
2870000	2872000	Nope.
2872000	2875000	When does that ever stop Microsoft from trying?
2875000	2883000	Well, I think that they're definitely not trying as hard with Windows Phone 8 and stuff.
2883000	2887000	I mean, it's probably selling alright, but I don't hear people going,
2887000	2891000	Oh, I need a Windows Phone 8. It's more like, I need an iPhone 5.
2891000	2895000	Or I need the next spiffy Android phone that's gonna come out.
2895000	2896000	I just don't-
2896000	2900000	Yeah, it's a possibility that they'll come out with something like this to try to get people in,
2900000	2904000	but I mean, I don't know why you would do it.
2904000	2912000	But let's just say that, you know, there are people that will buy things that don't make sense.
2912000	2914000	So, why not?
2914000	2915000	Why not?
2915000	2918000	Alright, well let me move on with some more news,
2918000	2924000	and this is about some things that have gone on in the Wii U front since the console launch.
2924000	2929000	Some folks talking about a Miiverse hack, and that Miiverse was hacked and all this.
2929000	2931000	That's not really what happened.
2931000	2934000	Somebody on NeoGaf said that they were screwing around with Miiverse,
2934000	2940000	and they were able to get into the debug and admin options of Miiverse.
2940000	2944000	Sounds like that wasn't really what it is, at least that's what Nintendo's claiming.
2944000	2950000	Nintendo's saying it was a prototype that Nintendo did send out a statement to gamesindustry.biz
2950000	2953000	saying that what the user found was a mock-up menu.
2953000	2956000	It's no longer there. It's inaccessible.
2956000	2965000	And that could be believable enough, especially if MiU at its core is basically running off a web protocol,
2965000	2967000	which is certainly possible.
2967000	2970000	I think that's absolutely possible. The whole damn thing is running off a web-type based protocol,
2970000	2972000	and we just kind of don't see it.
2972000	2973000	Why not?
2973000	2974000	I hope that's not the case.
2974000	2975000	It's probably very easy.
2975000	2979000	So, whatever. I mean, I'm spouting like I know what I'm talking about,
2979000	2985000	but it probably wasn't hard to find something like this in there,
2985000	2988000	and I don't think it's very serious, especially if it was a mock-up.
2988000	2993000	I mean, even just kind of looking at all the information on the screen, I don't think it's a big deal.
2993000	2996000	Anyway, if you want to know the full statement, quote,
2996000	3000000	It has come to our attention that some of the people were able to access a mock-up menu on Miiverse
3000000	3002000	following the launch of Wii U in the U.S.
3002000	3007000	Please note that this is only a mock-up menu and has now been removed and is not accessible.
3007000	3011000	Remember how we were talking about those doors that you open up and just, wham, you run into a wall?
3011000	3014000	Yeah, there's another one of those trapdoors right there.
3015000	3017000	Someone stumbled.
3017000	3022000	One other bit on the Wii U. I actually, you know, you've got to give Nintendo credit for this.
3022000	3028000	This is a comment from Frozenbyte who made Trine 2, which is one of the download titles available on Wii U.
3028000	3033000	You may not know this because it hasn't been talked about as much as the launch game,
3033000	3037000	but there are like five download-only games available on the Wii U.
3037000	3042000	I'm not talking about the retail land, but I'm talking about like $15 download games available on Wii U right now.
3042000	3046000	I personally have not tried any yet, but they're available. I've had friends that talk about it.
3046000	3048000	Do they have demos?
3048000	3050000	Not now, no.
3050000	3055000	Wow, Nintendo way to be in the forefront of, you know, digital content. Fuck, you know what?
3055000	3057000	Again, I'm gonna get...
3057000	3058000	PlayStation 1 had demos, I mean...
3058000	3063000	Well, but the Wii has demos, so again, I'm gonna say, was it ready to go by November 18th?
3063000	3066000	Look for it in December and January. That's the way it's gonna be.
3066000	3069000	It'll happen. It just wasn't ready November 18th.
3069000	3074000	But, okay, so they may not have demos, whatever, but let me get to this, because I do think this is worth mentioning.
3074000	3079000	So, Frozenbyte, they made Trine 2, which is probably one of the more visible titles that's there.
3079000	3085000	A quote from Mikael Haveri, who's the marketing manager, quote,
3085000	3092000	We have the power to price our products as we please, with just some basic guidelines from the big guys.
3092000	3098000	The step to this is purely from Nintendo's side, and they can clearly see that their previous installments have not been up to par.
3098000	3104000	We can set our own pricing, and actually continuing on that by setting our own sales whenever we want.
3104000	3110000	It is very close to what Apple and Steam are doing at the moment, and very indie-friendly.
3110000	3118000	So, in other words, Nintendo's tried to fix some of this and make the DLC part of the, or the, you know,
3118000	3122000	download distribution component of the Wii U a little bit lucrative.
3122000	3126000	Free patches! You can do patching all you want for free.
3126000	3134000	Considering we've heard the bitches from folks who make the Xbox Live Arcade games complain about the pricing of the patching over there,
3134000	3138000	that suddenly makes this very lucrative. Being able to put your own game on sale when you want and all that,
3138000	3141000	that's going to make this a lot more attractive.
3141000	3148000	It will be interesting to see if, you know, if it actually leads to the games being made, because that's what it's really about.
3148000	3153000	If that happens, though, if there will be any response from Microsoft and Sony.
3153000	3157000	But you've got to admit, Nintendo's doing the right thing there.
3157000	3158000	Yeah.
3158000	3162000	So, very interesting.
3162000	3163000	It makes good sense.
3163000	3170000	Yep. They've told us there are no basic payments for each patch, and we can update our game almost as much as we want.
3170000	3173000	For indie developers, this is huge.
3173000	3177000	I wonder if that might be a lure for Minecraft. Who knows?
3177000	3181000	Who knows? I like to just throw making up stuff out there.
3181000	3186000	SSJ100Matt in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com wanted to bring this up about the demos.
3186000	3191000	Wii U has kiosk demos. I'm sure it will happen soon.
3191000	3197000	Jason wants to point out, Loki, iOS doesn't have demos.
3197000	3199000	That's not true.
3199000	3200000	That's not true either.
3200000	3201000	It's up to the developer.
3201000	3202000	There's light versions.
3202000	3206000	Yeah, there's that whole light thing that they do, and now the whole in-app purchases.
3206000	3213000	You don't think about it because it's different than how Xbox and PlayStation does demos, but developers found a way to do it.
3213000	3218000	It'll be interesting to see how that plays out on Wii U if it does.
3218000	3220000	All right, moving on with more news. DarkSakura.
3220000	3222000	Oh, wait. I was going to add one last thing.
3222000	3223000	Yeah, go ahead.
3223000	3225000	There is actually some Wii hacks that actually happened.
3225000	3226000	Oh.
3226000	3232000	Legit stuff that it's not necessarily the Wii U, but it's run in the Wii U.
3233000	3235000	I fucking hate how they have this.
3235000	3241000	The Wii Channel on the Wii U, because that makes all the sense in the world.
3241000	3245000	I will say, I might be the only person who didn't transfer their Wii stuff over.
3245000	3249000	Like, I don't see the benefit of doing that right now.
3249000	3251000	Can a chatter sway me that I'm wrong on that?
3251000	3253000	Why would I want to do that?
3253000	3255000	I don't know.
3255000	3264000	There's a loader that was available for the Wii using Super Smash Bros. Brawl called Stack Smash.
3264000	3274000	What it basically does is it uses a modified, I want to say a modified Brawl stage save file to run unsigned code.
3274000	3278000	That exploit still works on the Wii U.
3278000	3284000	So you can actually run Wii Homebrew through the Wii Channel on the Wii U.
3284000	3289000	There was a game that was played in one of the videos I saw here.
3289000	3292000	Also, they were saying that basically not everything works.
3292000	3297000	You can't use the hacks to create the Homebrew Channel and stuff like that.
3297000	3309000	They're saying right now, nothing that requires Hack Mii uses the current kernel exploits or uses AHB prot will work.
3309000	3314000	It says that includes Devolution, USB Loader, CIOS installers, and Wii Linux.
3314000	3319000	But it says Nintendo cannot patch Stack Smash using their current architecture.
3319000	3323000	While it's technically possible, it would require a lot of work on their part.
3323000	3327000	It could result in Super Smash Bros. Brawl being unstable for all users.
3327000	3333000	Plus, it's most likely they knew that it would work before the guy posted the video.
3333000	3336000	So in other words, hackers gonna hack.
3336000	3339000	They're looking frantically for a way in that device.
3339000	3343000	The clock is running. How fast can they find the way into the Wii U?
3343000	3345000	They already have found kind of a way in.
3345000	3348000	Yeah, they found a kind of way in and they've also...
3348000	3355000	There was a video here that I guess they're dumping the console keys from the Wii mode stuff.
3355000	3360000	I don't really know what exactly they would use with that, but still interesting I guess.
3360000	3365000	Interesting to note though, Nintendo is kind of doing something where, you know...
3365000	3368000	Well, I guess Microsoft kind of does this too whenever you connect to Live.
3368000	3371000	Is that it's gonna automatically download firmware.
3371000	3373000	I mean, it'll download it overnight when it's not on and all that.
3373000	3377000	So it's kind of like more how PlayStation Plus kind of does it.
3377000	3380000	In theory, I mean, we haven't seen it happen first hand yet.
3380000	3384000	Because there's only been the one patch which most people do when you first turn on the system.
3384000	3389000	But in theory, this is gonna download things when you're asleep and they'll be there ready to install.
3389000	3391000	We'll see how that plays out.
3391000	3393000	Wasn't that what they were supposed to be doing at the Wii?
3393000	3396000	I remember that you were supposed to leave it on and, you know...
3396000	3399000	It would download stuff and you'd have that little ring light flashing.
3399000	3402000	Which I really wish they had the ring light stuff on there.
3402000	3404000	There were the messages.
3404000	3408000	It's now the home button on the pad is a blue light.
3408000	3411000	And whenever friends sign on and off, that little light lights up.
3411000	3413000	Yeah, that's just not as sexy as it was on the Wii.
3413000	3417000	It's not, but I just want to point out it's sort of there.
3417000	3419000	Sort of there.
3420000	3423000	Alright, now we'll move on to Dark Sakura and what she was gonna talk about.
3423000	3425000	Yeah, I just started crocheting again too.
3425000	3429000	Well, going back to some kind of old news.
3429000	3431000	We all know what the R4 cartridge is, right?
3432000	3433000	It is the little...
3433000	3435000	No, I don't know. Please educate me.
3435000	3439000	The R4, it's a flash cartridge that works on the DS.
3439000	3443000	You can use homebrew or pirated games on the system.
3443000	3446000	And there's also ones called like...
3446000	3450000	I had a Ninja Pass was one that I had that doesn't work anymore.
3452000	3458000	But now Nintendo has really got a push on and got it with the Japanese government.
3458000	3461000	That the R4 is now illegal to sell in Japan.
3462000	3468000	Actually, it's completely banned by the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.
3468000	3475000	It was illegal to sell since 2009, but importing it is completely illegal now.
3476000	3483000	As far as other places that it's been banned, it's now banned in France and the UK.
3483000	3488000	Amazon and eBay are no longer allowing this cartridge to be sold.
3489000	3496000	And different Australian distributors have been successfully sued by Nintendo.
3497000	3504000	I'm assuming it's still pretty available in the age-old venue of discreet brown paper bags in lavatories.
3504000	3505000	Probably, yeah.
3506000	3508000	I mean, if I wanted one, I could go get one.
3508000	3510000	There's ways to get it. You can order them online.
3510000	3516000	But it's now specifically illegal to import them in Japan.
3516000	3521000	Not just sell them like it was the rule. You can't import it.
3521000	3523000	I mean, you could, but you could go to jail.
3524000	3528000	Or have them stare at you sternly and force you to kill yourself.
3528000	3532000	Well, probably a lot of it has to do with how out there you're being too.
3532000	3539000	Because in Australia, I think it wasn't illegal to import the M-rated games because they had been banned in Australia.
3539000	3541000	Like, I remember Mortal Kombat and the new one.
3541000	3543000	Like, isn't it illegal to send that?
3543000	3549000	I mean, now maybe it's not because of the whole new rating board, but before it was illegal to send a copy over there.
3549000	3553000	But, like, how are they really going to find each and every person that does it?
3553000	3554000	Not that I'm encouraging it.
3554000	3557000	I think we all know why the R4 cart is being banned.
3557000	3558000	Although...
3559000	3560000	You can still buy them, of course.
3560000	3561000	Of course you can.
3561000	3575000	We remember the beginning of 2010, there was that UK guy who went to jail for a year for importing 26,000 games to set up with an R4.
3577000	3581000	There's a difference between 26,000 games and me going on Craigslist.
3581000	3587000	Yeah. Well, regardless, if people want something badly enough, they're going to find a way to make it happen.
3588000	3593000	It's just that now it's officially a punishable crime. The end.
3594000	3596000	And Nintendo just wants to put more hurdles up.
3596000	3597000	They want to make it harder.
3597000	3599000	Well, they want to protect their product.
3599000	3601000	They're certainly well within their rights to do it.
3602000	3603000	I get it.
3603000	3612000	I mean, if you think about it, and I hate to say this, it was how easily replicated games were for Dreamcast that contributed to the Dreamcast failure.
3612000	3615000	Nintendo's already sitting kind of in a precarious position.
3615000	3616000	Right.
3616000	3618000	So, of course they're going to want to protect their investment.
3619000	3628000	Which is a bummer because, you know, the homebrew element of it, you want to embrace, you want to be able to say, like, yeah, people should be able to run homebrew on it, but...
3628000	3633000	Unfortunately, 95% of the people I pulled that number completely out of my ass aren't really using it for...
3633000	3636000	Well, they're using it for homebrew and other things, you know.
3636000	3638000	See, I wanted to play fan translations.
3640000	3642000	But, you know, it's not in the cards.
3642000	3644000	Although technically that's illegal too, if you think about it.
3644000	3646000	Yeah, well, they can bite my ass.
3646000	3649000	Yeah, I know that that's always, like, I'm always feel like that too.
3649000	3650000	And I've talked about this on the show.
3650000	3654000	That's when I feel justified in piracy, like, and I know that's a controversial opinion.
3654000	3657000	I know you may not agree with me there and what have you.
3657000	3668000	But like, if a company just isn't going to do it, then let me just freaking get the translation version or, you know, let me get it from the other country.
3668000	3670000	You know, I went off on this casino blade.
3671000	3676000	You know, it's people who really like a series that's going to put that fun and, you know, that effort into it.
3676000	3682000	You know, and it really should actually more send a signal to the companies that fans want this.
3682000	3684000	I mean, like, what happened with, um...
3684000	3686000	Crap, what was that game that was on the Wii?
3686000	3687000	Xenoblade.
3687000	3688000	Xenoblade, yeah.
3688000	3690000	Of course people wanted Xenoblade.
3690000	3692000	And it was already, you know, in English.
3693000	3697000	But no one knew it and then they did it because, you know, they realized, hey, it's stupid.
3697000	3699000	People do want it, you know.
3701000	3704000	Apparently Last Story is doing...
3704000	3707000	It's not like, oh my gosh, take off, amazing.
3707000	3710000	But it's one... I think it's like XSeed's biggest selling title.
3710000	3711000	Yeah.
3711000	3712000	Is the Last Story.
3712000	3713000	So I really wanted to play that.
3713000	3718000	And some people are saying it's not a bad thing because right now you can get it for 20 bucks most places.
3718000	3726000	It's not a bad thing to pick up with a Wii U because it's kind of like, hey, has your Wii been collecting dust for three years but you're picking up a Wii U anyway?
3726000	3728000	Here's a Wii game you might have missed.
3728000	3729000	Smart strategy.
3730000	3731000	Very smart strategy.
3733000	3736000	Frisbee seems to agree with us in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
3736000	3741000	If you don't sell a product to a country, they can't complain about lost sales due to downloading.
3741000	3743000	I know that's a controversial opinion. I know it stinks.
3743000	3744000	But I'm kind of like, you know what?
3744000	3745000	It's technically right.
3745000	3751000	The internet puts us in a more global community than companies want to sometimes acknowledge.
3751000	3752000	And that's just the reality.
3752000	3755000	And if you feel so bad about it, why don't you freaking import it?
3756000	3759000	Import fees are so freaking expensive though.
3759000	3761000	And then region locking and all that crap.
3761000	3763000	Where's my disaster day in crisis?
3763000	3765000	There was another game that was in English.
3765000	3770000	Alright, let's move on with more news.
3770000	3774000	So Sony's credit rating is kind of crap.
3774000	3780000	You know, they're probably going to have to go to one of those credit agencies that they advertise on TV.
3780000	3781000	But not really.
3782000	3792000	So apparently one of the credit rating boards, I guess, out there, agencies, Fitch Ratings has rated them junk status.
3792000	3796000	Also, there was another company, I guess, Moody's, who I've never heard of.
3796000	3798000	I haven't heard either one of them.
3798000	3802000	They've dropped theirs to, I guess, one notch above junk.
3802000	3807000	So I guess it would be some people.
3807000	3812000	Some may call this junk, but I call them treasures, I guess.
3812000	3813000	That level.
3816000	3825000	They said the downgrade reflects Fitch's belief that the meaningful recovery will be slow given the company's loss of technology, leadership, and key products.
3825000	3830000	High competition, weak economic conditions in developed markets, and the strong yen.
3832000	3833000	So, yeah.
3833000	3836000	So it's a company saying that they're going to fail.
3836000	3841000	And I guess we just wait for them to either do so or not.
3841000	3842000	Am I correct, though?
3842000	3849000	I mean, I'm not up and up on all my financial world stuff, but I believe this doesn't mean Sony is failing.
3849000	3855000	It means that the analysts believe it's going to tank because they see the downward trend.
3856000	3867000	Yeah, it's basically saying, hey, banks that are lending Sony money, they're at more risk on, you know, not being able to pay those loans back, even though they're a big company.
3867000	3869000	Big companies file bankruptcy all the time.
3869000	3871000	So just Twinkies.
3871000	3872000	Yeah, the hostess company.
3872000	3873000	I mean, so.
3873000	3878000	Yeah, but also how many of Sony's CEOs are giving themselves raises every four months?
3879000	3884000	Well, I don't know, but also you're talking about more of a global company than hostess was.
3884000	3886000	Sony's based in Japan. It's very different culture there.
3886000	3887000	True.
3887000	3894000	But I mean, it's still if they have sound business practices and deal ethically, then I think that they can turn around.
3894000	3899000	What happened with hostess was a pure bout of greed and poor regulation.
3899000	3902000	Well, one thing with Sony is that they're more than games, too.
3902000	3905000	We have to remember there's a whole lot of other facets of Sony.
3905000	3912000	And even though their games may be doing OK, although I think people wish the PlayStation three were doing better, especially the Vita.
3912000	3913000	It sounds like they're not doing well.
3913000	3915000	Well, I think that they weren't doing well.
3915000	3922000	And just like some of the other fields, like, for example, Sony phones are Ericsson's not really a big thing anymore.
3922000	3923000	TVs.
3923000	3928000	Everybody goes off brand and gets the Black Friday 200 dollar TV.
3928000	3933000	However, Toshiba and Panasonic and Samsung have really pushed in LG, especially.
3933000	3936000	Those brands have really surpassed Sony in quality, though.
3936000	3942000	And I don't think people are buying cameras as much anymore because now the cameras and camera phones are all right.
3942000	3945000	I mean, they're, you know, multi megapixel cameras.
3945000	3947000	And for a lot of people, that's just enough.
3947000	3951000	They don't need anything dedicated to just a camera unless you're actually really in the photography.
3951000	3952000	Well, I'll tell you this.
3952000	3959000	My iPhone camera is tons better than the digital rebel that my husband has bought four years ago.
3959000	3961000	Dungeon Buster in our chat room.
3961000	3964000	Sony has a lot of internal issues that contributed to their failure.
3964000	3967000	They have had a lot of shifting and things going on lately.
3967000	3971000	Bob Coffee says the strong yen is what's fucking Japanese companies bad.
3971000	3974000	That exchange rate.
3974000	3981000	Dungeon Buster also clarifies his earlier comment saying all of their competitors hired who they tried to force into early retirement.
3981000	3983000	Hmm.
3983000	3986000	So, yeah, we have to remember Sony is more than just games.
3986000	3990000	But it's not like their games are performing, especially the Vita.
3990000	3994000	I mean, that that's not looking pretty for Sony right now.
3994000	4001000	Another thing, too, is that companies in Japan don't have those the rules regarding single types of products to like,
4001000	4006000	for example, Toyota also makes housing house housing siding.
4006000	4009000	Takara, you know, makes toys and wine.
4009000	4014000	You know, it's the companies are allowed to branch out into other areas and expand.
4014000	4020000	I mean, how else I think could Nintendo go from a card company to a, you know.
4020000	4026000	A computer entertainment company. But I think the point is, though, is that first of all,
4026000	4029000	I agree with the comment regarding the strength of the yen,
4029000	4035000	especially when you're dealing on an international market with other economies that you're relying on that don't have as strong
4036000	4041000	Fundage, then, yeah, you're going to run into a lot of problems on the exchange as well.
4041000	4044000	Since I brought up the Vita, I do want to remind people, if you've been neglecting your Vita,
4044000	4049000	PlayStation Plus just came out on the Vita and there was a 2.0 patch for everybody.
4049000	4052000	So just, you know, go turn on your Vita if you haven't in a while.
4052000	4054000	I didn't play enough of this game to really review it this week.
4054000	4058000	I'll talk about it next week. But my early impressions of Gravity Rush,
4058000	4061000	which is one of the free games on Plus right now.
4061000	4066000	Neat. I'm really liking what I see. It's like one of these games I'm like,
4066000	4070000	I think people totally missed this. I mean, I know it has its fans.
4070000	4072000	I've heard some people talking about it on Twitter and so forth.
4072000	4076000	But like, more people should be talking about Gravity Rush.
4076000	4078000	It's pretty great from what I've played of it so far.
4078000	4081000	And that's a free one on PlayStation Plus and the Uncharted game, of course.
4081000	4084000	And Wipeout. Wipeout is supposed to be one of the best.
4084000	4086000	It was one of the best looking games at launch.
4086000	4090000	And Tactics PSP, which, you know, some of you might not have even bothered to pick up or whatever.
4090000	4094000	It's free. So PlayStation Plus on Vita, looking nice right now.
4094000	4096000	So if you have a Vita and you happen to have PlayStation Plus,
4096000	4098000	I would really urge you to go check that free shit out.
4098000	4103000	Even if you don't want to, the 2.0 upgrade allows the wireless transmissions,
4103000	4105000	which is one of those duh, this thing should have been there in the beginning.
4105000	4109000	And all those features, which is great. So there you go.
4109000	4114000	And ShadowNextGen does want to say in chat, actually PlayStation is losing Sony money right now.
4115000	4118000	The Vita has hurt them a lot. Yeah, I mentioned the Vita earlier.
4118000	4123000	And I just, the sales in Japan and the US and everywhere really don't look good.
4123000	4128000	I think their opportunity with some of these games, I think was it,
4128000	4133000	the company that worked on Resistance and did the Call of Duty PS Vita versions.
4133000	4136000	That was bad. They hurt them bad.
4136000	4140000	Because Resistance is a great first person shooter franchise from Sony.
4140000	4144000	And it just, it sucked on the Vita.
4144000	4148000	And then, come to find out, and I was just very cautious,
4148000	4152000	I was like, ooh, black ops on the Vita, that's going to be awesome.
4152000	4154000	Then I saw what I was making, I was like, oh, wait a second.
4154000	4159000	Maybe I'll wait until the reviews come out. And sure enough, total crap.
4159000	4162000	Yeah, it's like, what happened to that, what was it?
4162000	4164000	Was it Game Developers Conference or one of those other,
4164000	4168000	where Sony just came out and said, we've got over 100 games coming to the Vita.
4170000	4174000	Where are they? What happened?
4174000	4178000	Final Fantasy X, we're going to remake that. When?
4178000	4181000	I don't know.
4181000	4184000	Uh-oh, are people abandoning ship? What's happening?
4184000	4192000	So, yeah, that's what I'm worried about, is that as the Vita kind of continues to not perform so well,
4192000	4194000	those parties are going to get off that sinking ship.
4194000	4196000	You know what's going to really help it?
4196000	4199000	In February, when Defense Force 2017 portable comes out.
4199000	4202000	Yeah, there you go. Keep on hoping. Keep on hoping.
4202000	4206000	All right, let me move on here. I want to talk about this.
4206000	4210000	I noticed when I was playing Curiosity this week, well, you don't really play Curiosity.
4210000	4213000	Yeah, I tried playing that while waiting for my car to be looked at,
4213000	4218000	because I took it to a dealership, just to say, hey, is there anything wrong with this?
4218000	4221000	Can you take a look at it, just to see if there's anything wrong with the car?
4221000	4223000	Wasn't anything, which is good.
4223000	4229000	But, yeah, I tried playing that, and it's like, oh, hey, cool, it's not updating. Awesome.
4229000	4236000	It works all right for me, and it's more like, again, I think I called it bubble wrap on last week's show,
4236000	4240000	and that's pretty much what it is. There's not really a game there. It's just tap, tap, tap.
4240000	4247000	You can do combos. Come on. It's pressing squares to make them disappear. It's not rocket science.
4248000	4256000	I was very intrigued that one of the layers on the Cube this week was an ad for a Kickstarter called Godus,
4256000	4263000	or not like Godus, like a female god, but like Godus, G-O-D-U-S, Godus.
4263000	4269000	Not really. It's Godus, which is supposed to be a reinvention of Populous.
4269000	4275000	I thought, actually, I got to be honest, as much as I think Curiosity is interesting and all,
4275000	4279000	that was tacky as shit, having that Kickstarter in there.
4279000	4285000	I wouldn't put it past Molyneux, though. The more I was thinking about it, I was like,
4285000	4291000	that is so a thing for him to do. But, anyway, I just found that tacky as shit.
4291000	4297000	But, regardless, I think it's neat that he's revisiting the Populous idea,
4297000	4301000	because I think that game in particular was a great game.
4301000	4307000	So, that is something that he started a Kickstarter for. It's available on, of course, Kickstarter.
4307000	4317000	They want 450,000 pounds to do the Rebirth of God games for PC, iOS, and Android.
4317000	4323000	And, you know, you can look at more details on the Kickstarter if you want about what all you can get from it.
4323000	4327000	But that is on his plate for games he wants to do.
4328000	4332000	I thought the 22 Cans had these other games lined up. Like, I remember reading about one.
4332000	4336000	I thought the next game was supposed to be Cooperation or something was supposed to be the next game for 22 Cans.
4336000	4340000	So, I don't know where this fits into it, if this is, like, an actual 22.
4340000	4345000	Because, remember, 22 Cans is because Molyneux's got 22 ideas for iOS games.
4345000	4353000	Whatever. I don't know where this fits into it. I don't know if this is one of the 22 or if this is, like, a bonus or what.
4354000	4357000	I hope it's as good as Populous. I guess that's all I can say.
4357000	4359000	I'm not giving him any money. No.
4359000	4368000	I just, I was kind of turned off by the ad in Curiosity. Like, I don't, I can't explain it. Like, it just, it was tacky.
4368000	4375000	I don't know. It turned me off to Curiosity, too. Is that what we're tapping away at? The big mystery in advertisement?
4375000	4377000	Hmm.
4377000	4379000	Alright, let's move on. Dark Sakura.
4379000	4383000	My computer just did something bizarre. Hold on. There we go.
4383000	4398000	So, as was teased earlier when we talked to Bobby, there's a game that I'm super excited about that's coming out on the 3DS through the Nintendo eShop.
4398000	4404000	And that is Space Harrier! Yay!
4404000	4416000	Mind you, it's not, like, I think the Sega Ages one. It's a currently redone 3D version of Space Harrier.
4416000	4420000	So I'm pretty excited about that because it's one of my favorite games ever.
4421000	4432000	And I'd actually, I think I've put it as, like, number three on my top games list. Like, number one being The Guardian Legend, number two being Fantasy Zone, and number three being Space Harrier.
4432000	4436000	So, welcome to the Fantasy Zone. Get ready.
4436000	4439000	Now you gotta get a 3DS.
4439000	4445000	You wanna know what's funny, Rob? I have about seven versions of Space Harrier at home.
4445000	4447000	Tell me you don't want this one.
4448000	4451000	I actually do have a 3D version of this game.
4451000	4455000	But you don't want the fancy new one? You don't want the 2012 or 2013 version?
4455000	4458000	But keep in mind, the 3DS does give me headaches.
4458000	4460000	You don't have to play in 3D mode.
4460000	4464000	Then I could just play my Sega Ages one.
4464000	4467000	One of my Sega Ages ones.
4467000	4473000	Alright, let's move on and travel around the world and check out some games that are coming out a little sooner than Space Harrier 3DS.
4473000	4479000	With release dates, I don't know if it's slowing down now or what's happening, but Loki, tell us about release dates.
4479000	4482000	Yeah, it's quite slowed down now.
4482000	4487000	Not a whole ton coming out this week. In fact, pretty much just a couple things.
4487000	4492000	You've got the American Mensa Academy on the 3DS.
4492000	4498000	Ratchet and Clank Full Frontal Assault on PS3.
4498000	4504000	Kids learn and play Pets and Vets on the DS and...
4506000	4509000	I think that actually might be it.
4512000	4515000	Oh, Scribblenauts Unlimited on PC.
4515000	4518000	I guess that wasn't ready to go yet.
4518000	4522000	Alright, well, traveling to Japan, since it's a little different over there and they didn't really have Black Friday.
4522000	4525000	You still have some games coming out in Japan.
4526000	4529000	Darkciders 2 comes out, as well as Love Tor.
4529000	4534000	Love Torre, probably. Mint version in limited and regular editions.
4534000	4537000	And this is a sequel to Sweet.
4537000	4540000	For a moment, I thought you said Toire.
4540000	4542000	Which means toilet.
4542000	4543000	Love Toilet?
4543000	4544000	Yeah.
4544000	4546000	No, I don't think these girls are having fun in Love Toire.
4546000	4547000	That's what it says. Toire.
4547000	4548000	Toire.
4548000	4551000	Let's see. Let me read the little description for this.
4551000	4553000	Hold on. Go away, box art. Go back to the description here.
4553000	4556000	I think I would play a game called Love Toilet.
4581000	4582000	Box description.
4582000	4584000	It's already been brought in.
4584000	4585000	Box description.
4585000	4588000	Gigantic, soulless eyes.
4591000	4592000	Kinda.
4592000	4595000	Alright, let's move on to the PlayStation 3.
4595000	4598000	On the PlayStation 3, Darkciders 2 is there as well.
4598000	4601000	As well as Power Smash 4 going into the Sega The Best collection.
4601000	4606000	Shin Sangoku Musou Online, Ryujin Orambu 5th Anniversary Pack.
4606000	4610000	That's probably just a repackaging of Shin Sangoku.
4610000	4614000	Sports Champions 2 makes its way to Japan on the 29th as well.
4614000	4622000	And Dai 2G Super Robot Taisen Original Generations in the regular and Blu-ray disc box.
4622000	4624000	So that's probably one of them combo packs.
4624000	4628000	Looking at the PlayStation Vita this week.
4628000	4631000	Fate Stay Night, Power Smash 4.
4631000	4633000	Price reduction there as well.
4633000	4636000	And Samurai and Dragons, Ryuzoku Kurin.
4637000	4646000	As well as a new game called Totori no Atlier Plus Arland no Renken Jutsuji 2 comes out over there as well.
4646000	4652000	Sorry to interrupt, but is Samurai and Dragons pretty much their version of Cowboys and Aliens?
4652000	4654000	It very well might be, I don't know.
4654000	4658000	I've heard these Atlier games though. There's one of them on PlayStation 3 out here.
4658000	4660000	There's a few out on PlayStation 3 out here.
4660000	4661000	Look at these two.
4661000	4665000	I don't think these two chicks who are embracing in this picture are wearing a top.
4665000	4666000	Just pointing out.
4666000	4667000	Or legal.
4667000	4668000	Or legal.
4668000	4669000	Just saying.
4669000	4672000	They're embracing in a bath house, I'm sure.
4672000	4675000	The graphics look pretty though outside of that picture.
4675000	4677000	Very cel shading and all that.
4677000	4682000	Let's see, Totori brings her tools, her books, and everything colorful to the PS Vita.
4682000	4685000	Forget about saving the world, you have more important business to attend to.
4685000	4692000	Namely, collecting your ingredients, learning new recipes, creating powerful items, and completing missions set by the guild.
4693000	4696000	In this game where you have a schedule to follow, every moment counts.
4696000	4699000	The PS Vita game includes new modes and upgrades.
4699000	4704000	People who adore Totori's motherly elder sister, Cici, can include her in the playing team right away.
4704000	4707000	There's also new enhancements and contents exclusive to the PS Vita version.
4707000	4709000	So maybe this is like a redo of that PS3 game.
4709000	4714000	Bob Coffee actually went back and made a comment about the love tote.
4714000	4715000	Yeah.
4715000	4719000	You got served cross bring it on equals moe moe pawa.
4720000	4725000	On the Wii U in Japan, not yet. December 8th is the big day.
4725000	4728000	So we got another week to go before we talk about Wii U in Japan.
4728000	4734000	But we can talk about the Nintendo 3DS and Naruto SD Powerful Shippuden.
4734000	4737000	Because what would the week be without a Naruto game?
4737000	4742000	Also, Layton Kaiju vs. Gaikuten Saiban comes out from level 5.
4742000	4743000	Oh hell yeah.
4743000	4746000	Yes! That needs to hurry up and come out over here so quickly.
4746000	4747000	You know who that is, right?
4747000	4750000	That's Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright.
4750000	4752000	Phoenix Wright. Hell yeah.
4752000	4754000	I didn't even, like I heard this.
4754000	4756000	Didn't you see the trailer?
4756000	4759000	I thought this was a thing like in development.
4759000	4761000	I didn't realize this was like coming out in Japan now.
4761000	4762000	Yeah.
4762000	4764000	Did you watch the trailer for this?
4764000	4766000	I think I did a long time ago now that you talked about it.
4766000	4767000	Pretty epic.
4767000	4768000	Really?
4768000	4769000	It's pretty cool.
4769000	4770000	Sort of semi off topic.
4770000	4772000	There's now a Phoenix Wright movie.
4772000	4773000	Oh yeah, oh yeah.
4773000	4774000	Yes.
4775000	4779000	Hopefully something will get here a little easier to obtain.
4779000	4780000	Oh yes.
4780000	4783000	Well I guess the internet's not much easier than that but you know.
4783000	4785000	Alright, that's going to do it for Japanese releases.
4785000	4787000	Let's go over to the UK, Dark Sakura.
4787000	4790000	On the 26th we have LEGO Lord of the Rings.
4790000	4794000	On the 27th we have Battlefield 3 Aftermath and Mass Effect 3 Omega.
4794000	4798000	I'm glad that like for DLC it gets its own release date.
4798000	4799000	That just makes me so happy.
4799000	4802000	Because they respect Mass Effect.
4802000	4811000	On the 20th of November Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition, Miasmada on PC and Stealth Bastard Deluxe.
4811000	4812000	That's the best name.
4812000	4813000	Stealth Bastard.
4813000	4816000	Or maybe it would be Stealth Busted.
4816000	4820000	You know, Eddie Iser just to be believed.
4820000	4823000	On the 29th, Arrow Porter on 3DS.
4823000	4831000	The 30th, Ben 10 Omniverse, Epic Mickey 2, The Power of 2, Far Cry 3, FIFA 13, Little Inferno, Warriors of Roshi 3 Hyper.
4831000	4833000	The Wii U.
4833000	4836000	The Zone of the Enders HD Collection.
4836000	4843000	And let me see what I've got for, if there's anything on December 1st, hold on.
4843000	4846000	God, I can't believe it's already almost December.
4846000	4849000	No, nothing until the 4th.
4849000	4854000	Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys and then the classic game of the week.
4854000	4855000	But first, Loki.
4855000	4856000	Yes.
4856000	4859000	So let's talk a little bit about Telltale Games.
4859000	4866000	And thankfully it's not about them closing down, but actually they're expanding starting spring 2013.
4866000	4871000	And what they're going to do is, I guess, they're moving out of their current office.
4871000	4876000	They're going to, I guess, get an office that's almost twice as big.
4876000	4886000	And right now they're looking to up their staff by, it looks like, 35 people starting in March and April of 2013.
4886000	4890000	And I guess that's good news that they're doing well.
4890000	4892000	So they've got, of course, a lot of games out right now.
4892000	4895000	They just finished up the second season of Walking Dead.
4895000	4898000	Or I guess, yeah, they're working on the second season of Walking Dead.
4898000	4907000	The first season just finished and actually should be coming out on a disc retail version two weeks from now.
4907000	4911000	So, pretty cool.
4911000	4913000	I agree with Bobby.
4913000	4917000	I hear great things about the Walking Dead.
4917000	4919000	I have heard so much good stuff about that.
4919000	4923000	A lot of people saying that's the game of the year right there is the Walking Dead.
4923000	4925000	I just haven't had a chance to play it.
4925000	4927000	There's so much stuff going on right now.
4927000	4930000	There's, you know, a new game every day.
4930000	4934000	But I want to take the time to sit down and play the Walking Dead at some point.
4934000	4941000	I am, some people on Twitter went so far as to say it is the best ending ever in a video game.
4941000	4944000	Kira, I don't want to see your spoilers, but I'm very curious.
4944000	4946000	I haven't watched any of the show, so...
4946000	4948000	It's not based on the show. It's based on the books.
4948000	4951000	Or the comics or whatever.
4951000	4954000	So you don't need to watch the show to understand it.
4954000	4956000	That was made pretty clear when the game first came out.
4956000	4958000	So it's very different.
4958000	4966000	But obviously, a lot of people who are into the show, which is a very popular show, are into this for similar reasons.
4966000	4969000	Regardless, it sounds like it came out better than Jurassic Park.
4969000	4971000	To be fair, I didn't play that either.
4971000	4973000	Now that song is stuck in my head.
4973000	4975000	Jurassic Park is frightening in the dark.
4975000	4978000	Jurassic Park is frightening in the dark.
4978000	4980000	Alright, let's see.
4980000	4986000	One more on Ubisoft and a comment they made this week about this current console generation.
4986000	4991000	Ubisoft doesn't want the next console generation to go quite as long.
4991000	4994000	This was in a talk with Polygon.
4994000	4997000	I can never say this guy's name right. Sorry in advance.
4997000	4999000	Yves Guillemot?
4999000	5001000	I don't know. It's French, so...
5001000	5003000	How would you say that? Right there.
5003000	5005000	Wilmot?
5005000	5007000	Wilmot?
5007000	5009000	Well, that's basically...
5009000	5011000	Yves Guillemot!
5013000	5015000	I think it would be Yves.
5015000	5017000	Yeah, he's the CEO at Ubisoft.
5017000	5019000	It's Yves. Haha, I'm French!
5019000	5020000	Stop it.
5020000	5026000	Alright, he's the CEO at Ubisoft and he said that basically it's kind of taken a while for hardware to come out.
5027000	5032000	Quote, we are used to the changing machines every five years.
5032000	5039000	When a console is out for a long time, you don't take as much risks on totally new IPs because even if they are good, they don't sell as well.
5039000	5043000	That's kind of an interesting comment because...
5043000	5047000	Zombie U is an Ubisoft game on the Wii U.
5047000	5052000	I'm not hearing a lot of good things from critics, but I'm hearing a lot of great things from players.
5052000	5058000	I obviously will trust the players a little more and I'll trust the critics, but I'm very curious about that game because it seems to be very polarizing.
5058000	5060000	And it's like a new thing.
5060000	5064000	A lot of people saying it's like an old Resident Evil game kind of mixed with Dark Souls.
5064000	5066000	Which sounds very scary.
5066000	5068000	But yeah.
5068000	5075000	So, he's basically saying that when a console is out for a long time, you don't want to take risks because they don't sell as well.
5076000	5082000	Is that the reason that it feels like this cycle has gone on way too long?
5082000	5085000	Or is that the rise of the mobile phone industry? I'm not sure.
5085000	5090000	I really get bothered though when I keep seeing traditional game companies.
5090000	5097000	I saw one article somewhere this week that was like, if you're a traditional game company, you're going to be dead in the water if you're not developing for mobile.
5097000	5099000	Your thing is dying.
5099000	5102000	And I'm just kind of like, no it's not.
5102000	5110000	I'm like, there's an audience that does, I mean it might not be as big or whatever, but there's definitely an audience that doesn't want that mobile gaming stuff.
5110000	5112000	I can't get what I need on mobile phone.
5112000	5116000	The Apple iPhone cannot game the way a console can.
5116000	5120000	When I get Mass Effect fully on my phone, maybe, but Infiltrator doesn't cut it.
5120000	5122000	No, Infiltrator kind of sucks.
5122000	5124000	Like it looks good, but the controls ruin it.
5124000	5126000	I touched it, but eh.
5126000	5128000	The controls ruin it.
5128000	5130000	Oh Rob, I touched it.
5130000	5138000	I don't know, but how can the next console generation be shorter?
5138000	5142000	They're not going to sell consoles saying, oh well we'll have a new one out in just four years.
5142000	5148000	They kind of want to encourage people that this next console may have to be the last one they ever buy.
5148000	5150000	Although we all know that's not true.
5150000	5152000	I mean you'll still be upgrading your PCs.
5152000	5158000	But even Alan kind of made a point the other day that even PC upgrades have kind of slowed a little bit.
5158000	5162000	Especially now versus maybe where we were at ten years ago.
5162000	5166000	We've kind of hit this cap.
5166000	5168000	I don't know.
5168000	5170000	Alright.
5170000	5174000	BlackWolf in our chatroom says, gaming on my TV will never die.
5174000	5176000	Amen to that.
5176000	5178000	Let's see.
5178000	5180000	ActDeaf talking about the Walking Dead game.
5180000	5184000	The game is really damn great, though I've only played the first two episodes.
5184000	5188000	Duke Nukem wants a Breaking Bad game after the series ends.
5188000	5190000	That's another one I hear a lot about.
5190000	5192000	No thank you, that show is awful.
5192000	5194000	You didn't like it?
5194000	5196000	I fucking hate that show.
5196000	5198000	I also hate Sons of Anarchy.
5198000	5200000	The acting in both are great.
5200000	5202000	I hate the subject matter.
5202000	5204000	I hate how the episodes go.
5204000	5210000	I hate basically awful, horrible people being put in a positive spotlight.
5210000	5212000	You know.
5212000	5214000	Okay yeah, Hitler was an artist, but that doesn't mean I'm a fan.
5214000	5218000	Pinning an apartment in one afternoon, two coats.
5220000	5222000	I only have time to watch RuPaul's Drag Race.
5222000	5224000	Alright.
5224000	5232000	To register participation for this week's episode of Orange Lounge Radio on vognetwork.com, use the passphrase, mouse.
5232000	5236000	Let's travel to a time when we didn't even have these mobile phones.
5236000	5238000	They were called car phones, not mobile phones.
5238000	5240000	Not even when this was out, I think.
5240000	5242000	You had a brick in the car.
5242000	5244000	16 bits and we liked it.
5244000	5250000	That's right, you had your gaming in 16 or 8 or whatever bits and you liked it that way.
5250000	5258000	It's the classic game of the week where Dark Soccer is going to climb into the gaming vault and find a game that she thinks, hey, play it.
5258000	5260000	It's a little sticky.
5260000	5262000	This one, most of you have probably already played.
5262000	5264000	But if you haven't, you're fucking missing out.
5264000	5268000	It was also hopefully chosen by Rachel.
5270000	5272000	The game is Earthbound.
5272000	5274000	Yeah, I know. I've done Mother before.
5274000	5276000	I haven't done Mother 2, so shut up.
5276000	5278000	Don't judge me.
5278000	5280000	This one was...
5280000	5284000	I don't think there's very many people that are going to judge you for doing another Mother game.
5284000	5286000	This series is beloved by a lot of people.
5286000	5290000	Yeah, I need to actually break out my copy and play it.
5290000	5292000	Yes, I do have this game.
5292000	5296000	But in Japan, it was Mother 2 Gigu no Gyakushu.
5296000	5300000	Which, I don't know what Gyakushu means, so somebody translate for me.
5300000	5302000	Oh, I knew that once.
5302000	5304000	Probably...
5304000	5306000	...Gig's Revenge.
5306000	5308000	Something like that.
5308000	5314000	At any rate, when it came out with the attract demo, there were two different names.
5314000	5318000	One was Earthbound, the war against Giygas.
5318000	5320000	And the other one was Mother 2.
5322000	5326000	However they've written it, G-Y-I-Y-G, that's a weird way to spell it.
5326000	5328000	Strikes Back.
5328000	5332000	It was designed by Shigesato Itoi.
5332000	5336000	And it was actually the sequel to Mother.
5336000	5338000	I was going to say, he was the last boss in the game.
5338000	5340000	That's why he's named that.
5340000	5342000	Okay.
5342000	5344000	Well, no, I know that was his name.
5344000	5346000	I didn't know why they spelled it that way.
5346000	5348000	Because it's very weird.
5348000	5356000	At any rate, the game was released on August 27th, 1994 in Japan.
5356000	5360000	And in America as Earthbound on June 5th, 1995.
5360000	5364000	As a standalone, as not a sequel to anything.
5364000	5366000	Because we didn't know.
5366000	5368000	We had an import back then, huh?
5368000	5370000	We had Final Fantasy 6 as Final Fantasy 3.
5370000	5372000	Come on.
5372000	5374000	Yeah.
5374000	5376000	And then we had our spoon bards.
5376000	5378000	Yes.
5378000	5380000	In Final Fantasy 2.4.
5380000	5382000	Bouldlerized translations.
5382000	5384000	It's actually evident in a few places in Earthbound.
5384000	5392000	There's a sequence fairly close to the beginning where they replaced a beating sound with a scolding sound.
5392000	5396000	And that's your nemesis, basically.
5396000	5398000	He comes home and he gets his ass whooped by his parents.
5398000	5402000	Thus launching into the game proper, I think.
5402000	5406000	Well, the game did not sell very well.
5406000	5408000	And it was new.
5408000	5416000	However, everyone loved it because they really liked the satire of American culture.
5416000	5422000	And the different parodies showing up for the RPG genre.
5422000	5426000	It's so quintessentially Japanese.
5426000	5428000	There's just something so unique about it.
5428000	5432000	You could not have something like Mr. Saturn in an American game.
5432000	5434000	That's true.
5434000	5440000	I like Mr. Saturn in Smash Brothers because you can hit people with him.
5440000	5442000	Or the cultist. That was my favorite part of the game.
5442000	5444000	Ah, yes.
5444000	5446000	This shit was hilarious.
5446000	5448000	Or a boss made out of vomit.
5448000	5452000	I do like running around in your pajamas, but in the original, you were naked.
5452000	5454000	Oh, yes.
5454000	5460000	It's just such a unique game. That's one of the things that drew me toward it.
5460000	5464000	They had a sequel planned for the Nintendo 64 double D.
5464000	5466000	Which was Earthbound 64.
5466000	5470000	And it had been in development for a while before it was cancelled.
5470000	5474000	And then it came out as a GBA game called Mother 3.
5474000	5476000	And it only came out in Japan.
5476000	5478000	However, there are fan translations.
5478000	5482000	They have a very loose connection to Mother 2.
5482000	5484000	But you can play it on its own.
5484000	5486000	There's actually a few returning characters.
5486000	5492000	Yes, and you know, playing the prequel to it does make for a much richer experience.
5492000	5494000	It will punch you in the emotions.
5494000	5496000	I assure you. It'll get you in the feels.
5496000	5498000	Yes.
5498000	5504000	Now, it actually uses a kind of different sort of projection for playing the game.
5504000	5508000	It uses what's called oblique projection instead of the top down.
5508000	5514000	So that you're sort of skewed on a different level with all of the things around it.
5514000	5522000	So it gives the world, even though it is purely 2D, it gives it some sort of...
5522000	5526000	It really makes it seamless as you go from place to place.
5526000	5528000	You know, I think Pokemon uses kind of a similar...
5528000	5530000	Pretty similar, yeah, style.
5530000	5536000	But I really liked its use of the color palette on the SNES.
5536000	5538000	Because I thought it was just gorgeous.
5538000	5540000	Oh yes, yes.
5540000	5542000	It's not just color, it's how they use it.
5542000	5547000	But it also doesn't use random encounters like the first Mother game did.
5547000	5549000	Oh yeah.
5549000	5552000	And it is not every three steps like the original Mother.
5552000	5554000	Yes.
5554000	5558000	So basically, you beat them down to zero.
5558000	5560000	For their hit points, they get killed.
5560000	5565000	And if you defeat a specific type of enemy, there's a chance you'll get an item.
5565000	5568000	Also, my favorite part about it was the rolling counter.
5568000	5573000	You could get mortally hit and still finish a fight and live.
5573000	5579000	So if you gave yourself enough time, especially towards the end when you're upwards of 300 life,
5579000	5581000	that was pretty sweet.
5581000	5587000	I like how it compares your hit points box to an odometer.
5587000	5589000	Oh yeah.
5589000	5596000	And then of course you had your psi attacks that used your psychic points.
5596000	5599000	I guess PK fire.
5599000	5603000	I heard that way too many times playing Smash Brothers.
5603000	5605000	PK fire! PK fire!
5605000	5607000	It just never goes away.
5607000	5612000	As far as your weapons go, and yeah, your main character is Ness,
5612000	5616000	but different weapons were available such as baseball bats, yo-yos, and frying pans.
5616000	5620000	Except for one character named Pooh, who can use a sword.
5620000	5622000	But that was only way at the end.
5622000	5625000	For most of the game, he's just using his fists.
5625000	5627000	And this is like, what, a 12-year-old?
5627000	5628000	Yeah.
5628000	5630000	Give him props for that.
5630000	5632000	Well, when you're fighting, vomit.
5633000	5638000	And miniaturized UFOs, wearing bows, and yes, all sorts of critters.
5638000	5640000	You had all kinds of neat places in the game too.
5640000	5646000	You had Onett, you know, Toussaint 3 to 4side, you know.
5646000	5647000	They were named.
5647000	5653000	You also had Winters, Summers, and Dallam, Scaraba, you know,
5653000	5655000	different places that were meant to mimic different areas.
5655000	5657000	Highly creative names.
5658000	5663000	And then you had to, you know, beat the Star Men and everything.
5663000	5667000	What I really like is looking at the concept art for this game.
5667000	5668000	Oh, yes.
5668000	5670000	I don't know if you've ever seen any of the concept art for this.
5670000	5672000	It's quite whimsical, and it's just aching and beautiful.
5672000	5674000	It makes me think of a child's storybook.
5674000	5676000	Oh, yes, especially I...
5676000	5678000	This would be a fucked up story.
5678000	5682000	But my favorite was always Dungeon Man, because, you know,
5682000	5685000	you could see just this like really whimsical turn to it.
5685000	5688000	And it's also, there's so much detail in it and so much life.
5688000	5690000	It's like, this is such a life affirming game.
5690000	5693000	That's one reason I always went back to it.
5695000	5700000	There was part of the dialogue for the final battle,
5700000	5703000	and this was actually, I was reading,
5703000	5707000	is this something that I'd read before about the military policemen
5707000	5709000	and the dismembered beauty?
5709000	5713000	Yes, and it's not actually a rape scene, as is often misquoted,
5713000	5716000	but it's a sex scene which turns into a murder scene,
5716000	5721000	which, you know, is not really a point for splitting money hairs.
5721000	5726000	But it's always said that it had such an impact on him
5726000	5728000	that he incorporated it into the game.
5728000	5730000	And it works really well.
5730000	5732000	It's very disjointed, and it's kind of horrifying,
5732000	5735000	because there's just this sense of out-of-place-ness there
5735000	5737000	that you don't get in many games.
5737000	5739000	But I like that when they marketed this in Japan,
5739000	5744000	they actually used a member of SMOP to advertise the game.
5744000	5748000	They had scratches of stickers that came out with it.
5748000	5751000	They did all kinds of stuff with weekly Famitsu
5751000	5753000	to promote the hell out of this game,
5753000	5756000	and of course, sadly, it didn't sell up to expectations.
5756000	5761000	But in America, it sold 140,000 copies and twice that many in Japan,
5761000	5763000	which is still not all that great,
5763000	5766000	not for how SNES games were selling at the time.
5766000	5771000	But, you know, it's like many things that are underappreciated when they're new.
5771000	5773000	They go back and get that cult status.
5773000	5774000	Oh, yes.
5774000	5779000	And now, you know, it's just considered one of the top games ever.
5779000	5782000	In 2006, there was a poll in Famitsu,
5782000	5785000	and it was rated the 37th best game of all time out of 100.
5785000	5792000	And it was listed from Gamasutra as one of the top 20 essential Japanese RPGs.
5792000	5794000	I really love this game, for the record,
5794000	5796000	because, you know, and I remember playing this.
5796000	5799000	I rented this at least, like, four times from the store and stuff like that,
5799000	5801000	just playing the shit out of it.
5801000	5804000	One reason I really liked it is that, you know,
5804000	5807000	I was really into Final Fantasy and all those games on the Super Nintendo,
5807000	5809000	and this was very kind of, it was like that,
5809000	5812000	but very, like, it wasn't swords and sorcery and stuff.
5812000	5814000	It was just like kids being stupid.
5814000	5815000	And I loved that.
5815000	5817000	Like, it was very cartoonish,
5817000	5820000	like the most cartoony thing you could really play on the Super Nintendo at the time,
5820000	5823000	but yet it was like this Final Fantasy RPG.
5823000	5825000	That's what I always really loved about it.
5825000	5827000	I really should break out my copy again and play it.
5827000	5828000	Good times.
5828000	5833000	But, yeah, I actually have, I believe this is one of the ones I have in the box still.
5833000	5836000	I have to admit, I came into this, you know, afterwards.
5836000	5838000	This was not one of the ones we had on the console.
5838000	5840000	I actually completed this on emulator, so, you know,
5840000	5843000	sorry if that disqualifies me as a serious gamer, but...
5843000	5846000	I think a lot of people just kind of discovered it that way.
5846000	5849000	It's really hard to find it for less than 60 bucks.
5849000	5850000	Yes, yes.
5850000	5852000	But, you know, at the same time,
5852000	5857000	I feel, you know, kind of glad that it's, you know, found such popularity on an emulator,
5857000	5859000	because it has reached a much wider audience,
5859000	5864000	and it does make for a richer experience that you can get it out to different people,
5864000	5868000	and you find all these little secrets and things you hadn't seen before.
5868000	5870000	Did you see the embryos?
5870000	5871000	You know...
5871000	5872000	In the very last stage?
5872000	5873000	I've seen that, yeah, but you know what?
5873000	5875000	I don't think that is intentional.
5875000	5877000	Like, I don't think that's an intentional design thing.
5877000	5882000	That's a bit like, you know, the backwards tribute to Satan in the Led Zeppelin song.
5882000	5883000	It's not...
5883000	5889000	Yeah, but I could, but given E-toys history, maybe I could see it happening.
5889000	5892000	I just don't know how you didn't actually get that,
5892000	5894000	because it's not just one static image.
5894000	5896000	It's sort of a rolling thing.
5896000	5898000	But it's a repeating. It's a tile.
5898000	5900000	But it's like, it's moving.
5900000	5901000	So I don't...
5901000	5903000	I don't know.
5903000	5908000	I mean, at any rate, for other things that have happened with the series,
5908000	5912000	of course, it...
5912000	5918000	Definitely Ness and other characters have shown up in the Super Smash Bros. series,
5918000	5919000	and...
5919000	5923000	Well, Ness was a hidden character, but everyone freaking used him.
5923000	5927000	And Onett was actually a stage in Brawl,
5927000	5931000	and New Pork City in Mother 3 showed up in Brawl as well,
5932000	5934000	to the rejoice of all who wanted to see it in 3D.
5934000	5935000	Yes.
5935000	5939000	There were also trophies for Paula, Jeff, and Pooh.
5939000	5943000	And Jeff is an assist trophy in Super Smash Bros. Brawl.
5943000	5949000	And his multi-bottle rockets were involved as well.
5949000	5953000	And Mr. Saturn, you could throw him at people, because that was awesome.
5953000	5956000	Why was... Mr. Saturn should have been our Pikachu.
5956000	5959000	Mr. Saturn, however, you got special...
5959000	5962000	It was like, you got an achievement for Mr. Saturn-love,
5962000	5964000	or you got points for it,
5964000	5967000	when you let him wander around the screen and didn't throw him at people.
5967000	5969000	I always thought it was funny.
5969000	5971000	And Mr. Saturn only wants to help.
5971000	5973000	You can't help it that he's just a butt on legs.
5973000	5974000	With Bo.
5977000	5979000	Well, at any rate, like I said earlier,
5979000	5982000	there was supposed to be a sequel in 96 on the 64DD,
5982000	5985000	but it kept having production problems,
5985000	5988000	and didn't show at E3 and other gaming conventions.
5988000	5991000	So Nintendo cancelled it on August 21st, 2000,
5991000	5994000	but it resurfaced as a GBA title,
5994000	5996000	and it was only released in Japan.
5996000	6001000	And also Itoi said he had no more plans to develop the series any further.
6001000	6006000	There was an ESRB rating that said that it might come out on Wii,
6006000	6008000	but there are still no official plans.
6008000	6013000	And I want to give further props to the fan translation community,
6013000	6017000	because in their fight to translate this,
6017000	6021000	they also found a lot of cool, unused things.
6021000	6024000	Just sort of artifacts that were left in the data.
6024000	6025000	Vomit?
6025000	6027000	Yes. Well, unfortunately, no.
6027000	6031000	Just things that, you know, unused bosses and unused sprites,
6031000	6036000	they make you wonder at what was originally planned for this,
6036000	6040000	because there were a few places that the creator said
6040000	6043000	he actually had to scale it back a bit because it was frightening him.
6043000	6047000	I'm, of course, referring to the extended mushroom trip,
6047000	6049000	like sort of halfway through the game.
6049000	6052000	I actually need to sit down and play E3,
6052000	6054000	because I just haven't had time.
6054000	6056000	Well, there's an extended mushroom trip.
6056000	6057000	And the final boss.
6057000	6058000	I like extended mushroom trips.
6058000	6061000	The final boss, there is an unused boss battle,
6061000	6064000	which is, I think it's available on YouTube,
6064000	6070000	which is deeply unsettling, despite my lack of understanding Japanese.
6070000	6075000	But as it stands, the Mother 3 game is a very emotionally engaging
6075000	6077000	and rich game, I find.
6077000	6084000	And it's got its predecessor's balance of horror and just awesomeness.
6084000	6087000	Well, this also, I think, is kind of cool.
6087000	6091000	The sound designer for Earthbound, Keiichi Suzuki,
6091000	6095000	he actually said that the biggest influence for the music for him
6095000	6097000	was John Lennon.
6097000	6098000	Excellent.
6098000	6100000	You know, in the YouTube we're watching here,
6100000	6102000	I just saw a reference to the Beatles,
6102000	6104000	and it's like one of those funny little jokes, like,
6104000	6107000	do you know the name of this Beatles song?
6107000	6109000	Blank Blank Blank Turday.
6109000	6111000	And the options are yes and no.
6111000	6114000	Like, it's a funny joke because you can say yes.
6114000	6116000	You're right, it's yesterday.
6116000	6117000	Anyway.
6117000	6119000	And, you know, music references, sadly,
6119000	6123000	are one of the reasons they'd have trouble releasing Mother 3 in the U.S.
6123000	6128000	Because there is the Runaway 5 in Earthbound.
6128000	6131000	It was actually originally kind of a Blues Brother-y tribute,
6131000	6134000	which it's kind of evident in the finished product of the game.
6134000	6138000	But I can't remember, it's the DMC or something like that?
6138000	6140000	There's Pinball. I just saw Pinball.
6140000	6142000	I forgot there was Pinball in the arcade.
6142000	6143000	Sweet.
6143000	6150000	But there's also the band in Mother 3 is also kind of clearly ripped off another band.
6150000	6152000	Escapes me.
6152000	6154000	Well, that's the game.
6154000	6160000	Mother 2 slash Earthbound with strong hints towards Mother 3.
6160000	6162000	All right, there it is, your classic game of the week.
6162000	6164000	Earthbound, Mother 2.
6164000	6167000	And a little dash of Mother 3, but we have to save that for another week.
6167000	6170000	We should do a Gaiden version called Daddy.
6170000	6173000	Anyhow, that's going to do it for Part A, but don't go anywhere.
6173000	6174000	We have plenty more to come.
6174000	6177000	We may not have a whole lot of news, but we do have the rapid-fire news.
6177000	6179000	We have your Fugu question of the week coming up as well.
6179000	6184000	Mailbag and Match Game coming back tonight in Part B.
6184000	6185000	Don't go anywhere, guys.
6185000	6188000	We'll be right back after this with more of Orange Lounge Radio.
6194000	6197000	Welcome back, everybody, to Orange Lounge Radio.
6197000	6203000	Live here on November the 25th of 2012 with the 483rd episode of our show.
6203000	6206000	It's a little bit of a slower news week this week,
6206000	6208000	but that's all right.
6208000	6210000	We still have some news stories to talk about,
6210000	6213000	including the rapid-fire news, which is coming up right now.
6213000	6214000	Loki.
6214000	6215000	Yes.
6215000	6220000	So let's talk about my favorite gaming series, Grand Theft Auto.
6220000	6225000	Grand Theft Auto had a wonderful release on iOS and Android of Grand Theft Auto 3,
6225000	6229000	celebrating the 10th anniversary earlier this year, maybe even last year.
6229000	6230000	I can't remember.
6230000	6234000	But soon enough, you'll be able to get some more Grand Theft Auto love
6234000	6238000	on your portable devices with Grand Theft Auto Vice City,
6238000	6242000	the HD treatment for the 10th anniversary of that game as well.
6242000	6247000	So I'm hoping that San Andreas is only a couple more years away.
6247000	6251000	And that'll be available on December 6th,
6251000	6257000	and apparently it's going to cost you $5 on both Android or iOS.
6259000	6261000	That's fantastic.
6261000	6263000	I cannot wait.
6263000	6267000	Except I can, because I'm not actually going to play it on the phone,
6267000	6270000	because gaming on the phone sucks.
6270000	6272000	And then to kind of go along with that,
6272000	6280000	there's kind of a fan campaign to try to get Grand Theft Auto 5 onto PC and the Wii U.
6280000	6285000	And of course, developers are like, well, anything is up for consideration.
6285000	6287000	And of course, they haven't announced anything.
6288000	6294000	Right now, they're mainly focused on getting the game out on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
6294000	6297000	It's hard to say if there's actually going to be a PC version for the game.
6297000	6301000	The scene is that there wasn't one for Red Dead Redemption,
6301000	6303000	although there was one for L.A. Noire.
6303000	6305000	So I don't know.
6305000	6308000	It'd be kind of cool if it was on PC, because that game looks fantastic.
6310000	6311000	I don't know.
6311000	6314000	I may need to get a new PC for that if they do end up getting one.
6315000	6319000	And then also, of course, Reggie threw in his two cents saying,
6319000	6322000	yeah, we'd totally love Grand Theft Auto 5 on the Wii U.
6322000	6325000	Yes, that would probably be a nice system selling game now, wouldn't it?
6325000	6328000	Except right now, it's still up in the air.
6328000	6332000	And last but not least, I'm not sure this should make you angry or excited,
6332000	6334000	the fact that this is coming out over here.
6334000	6342000	The Bayonetta DLC that was available in Japan is coming to North America.
6342000	6346000	However, it's coming to North America as a GameStop exclusive.
6346000	6350000	And I guess it will be kind of a day one limited edition.
6350000	6357000	Also in Europe, the U.S., you're going to have to wait until it comes out in January.
6357000	6363000	And if you really want that DLC, you're going to have to wait and purchase it from GameStop.
6363000	6365000	And the game is supposed to be a lot cheaper.
6365000	6369000	It's only $29.99 as opposed to a full-price game.
6369000	6375000	It is kind of disappointing, though, that GameStop locked in the DLC for that.
6375000	6377000	I hate that. Whatever.
6377000	6379000	I mean, you never know. That stuff could come out later on.
6379000	6380000	They could sell it later.
6380000	6387000	But just throwing GameStop alone, I guess, and giving them exclusive DLC.
6387000	6390000	Not going to hold my breath.
6390000	6392000	All right. Well, moving on.
6392000	6393000	This is pretty good.
6393000	6395000	I mean, I know we've talked about some Vita hardships,
6395000	6397000	but there's a lot of good stuff to talk about on Vita right now,
6397000	6400000	not just the free games, but price reductions.
6400000	6405000	November 27th is going to see some price reductions on the PlayStation Network for the download.
6405000	6408000	You know, if you have a memory card large enough to hold some games,
6408000	6411000	you can get some games for a lot cheaper than they used to be.
6411000	6417000	For $17.99, Hot Shots Golf, Little Deviants, MLB 12 The Show, ModNation Racers,
6417000	6420000	Reality Fighters, and Wipeout 2048.
6420000	6425000	$26.99, Resistance Burning Skies, Smart As, not to be confused with Smart As,
6425000	6429000	and Unit 13, and then $35.99 for Uncharted Golden Abyss,
6429000	6433000	but as mentioned before, you could get that free with PlayStation Plus.
6433000	6435000	You would just have to kind of juggle, like, you know,
6435000	6439000	remember when you are on PlayStation Plus, if you let your account lapse,
6439000	6440000	you'll lose all those free games.
6440000	6444000	So you kind of have to weigh, is that something I really want to be locked into?
6444000	6446000	I don't mind it, personally, because I don't, you know,
6446000	6448000	the games I'm getting for free aren't things that, like,
6448000	6452000	if I really want a game bad enough that I can revisit whenever, I'll buy it.
6452000	6457000	But I like that PlayStation Plus kind of allows me to play games I might have missed from a couple years ago.
6457000	6460000	So, I don't know, I don't want to sound like a mouthpiece for Sony,
6460000	6465000	but I'm glad to see that they're reducing the price of some of these games.
6465000	6468000	Might be what the system needs right now.
6468000	6471000	Darkstalker Resurrection, some folks looking forward to this.
6471000	6476000	This is the Darkstalker games for Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.
6476000	6477000	Happy, happy, happy.
6477000	6478000	This is that collection.
6478000	6481000	Yep, there's also going to be a new tournament, an online tournament mode coming in the game.
6481000	6483000	This is according to Capcom Unity.
6483000	6486000	The online mode is going to support eight players.
6486000	6489000	Sudden Death, One Takes All, Best of Two or Best of Three.
6489000	6494000	Resurrection will also include the usual ranked and player matches.
6494000	6497000	Resurrection, of course, being the name of this download game.
6497000	6499000	Pretty cool there.
6499000	6504000	And you can do replays on YouTube, so can't wait for YouTube to get flooded with this stuff.
6504000	6505000	So that's pretty cool.
6505000	6511000	14.99 on PlayStation Network, 1200 Microsoft points on Xbox Live Arcade when it comes out in 2013.
6511000	6516000	If you're a fan of Half-Minute Hero, maybe you're wondering when are we getting Half-Minute Hero 2.
6516000	6522000	Well, Marvelous producer Esteban Salazar told Siliconera that,
6522000	6525000	quote, it's considerably more expensive to put out the sequel,
6525000	6530000	and they need to sell a lot more of the first game on PC to begin to justify it.
6530000	6533000	If this is something you're interested in, you might want to, quote,
6533000	6537000	encourage your friends to buy the Steam version or buy it for them.
6537000	6540000	P.S., the game's 40% off on Steam right now.
6540000	6544000	Actually, that wasn't in the quote, but that sure seemed to be convenient.
6544000	6549000	So, yep, you want Half-Minute Hero 2, buy part one for friends.
6549000	6552000	Half-Minute Hero was kind of fun.
6552000	6554000	I mean, I'm not going to cry if the sequel never comes out,
6554000	6558000	but I'm surprised it didn't sell enough to necessitate the sequel.
6558000	6559000	Dark Sakura.
6559000	6562000	Stuff happened. The end. No, I'm kidding.
6562000	6571000	For fans of the AM2 games, they are going to be out on Xbox Live Arcade
6571000	6573000	and PlayStation Network during the week.
6573000	6577000	We have Fighting Vipers, Sonic the Fighters, which I'm more excited about,
6577000	6580000	and Virtua Fighter 2, which I could give less than a crap about,
6580000	6584000	but I'm usually very alone in that.
6584000	6586000	The games are going to have their own achievements and trophies
6586000	6589000	and will support online multiplayer.
6589000	6600000	They will be about five bucks each and about 4.49 euro in Europe.
6600000	6607000	So they'll be out on November 27th in North America and December 5th in Europe.
6607000	6611000	Man, I have Fighters Megamix at home,
6611000	6617000	and I wish that they would update Fighters Megamix. Wouldn't that be awesome?
6617000	6622000	So anyway, Capcom's also getting back into more fighting game stuff.
6622000	6625000	They've registered the name Fighters of Capcom.
6625000	6631000	It's a trademark, actually, and they haven't really said what it's about,
6631000	6636000	but maybe it'll be good. Hopefully.
6636000	6640000	And moving forward, on the Korean ratings board,
6640000	6647000	Resident Evil Revelations has been listed for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3,
6647000	6652000	so that means we might actually be getting the version out for the bigger consoles.
6652000	6655000	Who knows? And that is that.
6655000	6659000	All right. Let's take a trip over to Facebook and Google Plus,
6659000	6662000	and when you slam those words together, you get Boogle.
6662000	6671000	The Foogle Question of the Week.
6671000	6675000	We ask a question of our Facebook and Google Plus communities and look for some answers.
6675000	6680000	And of course, it's got to be about the Wii U again this week, but with good reason.
6680000	6684000	This is about kind of how we're feeling post launch of the Wii U.
6684000	6687000	Here's the question from our Facebook community at facebook.com slash Orange Launch Radio
6687000	6690000	and our Google Plus community. Search for Orange Launch Radio.
6690000	6693000	Now that the console has been out for a week,
6693000	6698000	have you found that your opinion has changed on the Wii U from the pre-release hype?
6698000	6703000	Perhaps you weren't so excited about it before, but you ended up buying one for a reason,
6703000	6707000	or you were really excited after E3, but found that maybe you'll hold off for a while.
6707000	6710000	Why did or didn't your opinion change?
6710000	6713000	Let's go to some comments first off from Facebook.
6713000	6717000	Wicked said, originally I wasn't too keen on the Wii U.
6717000	6722000	It seemed like it was coming out too early for it to be a next-gen console,
6722000	6725000	especially since the graphics wasn't much better than what was out now.
6725000	6730000	Also, sequelizing a console the way they did, essentially requiring the Wii to fully utilize the Wii U's potential,
6730000	6732000	seemed like a cop-out.
6732000	6734000	Wow, I was wrong.
6734000	6740000	The graphics are definitely top notch, and the Wii's usual stigma of waggle wand was significantly downplayed.
6740000	6745000	The games are amazing, especially Zombie U and Nintendo Land, which could easily be the party game of the year.
6745000	6749000	As lukewarm as I was for the Wii U, I must say, after having it in my hands,
6749000	6754000	which the tablet controller feels perfectly fine in, I am definitely on the bandwagon now.
6754000	6760000	Virtual Phil said, I was excited for it, but also a bit meh regarding the annoying hype.
6760000	6765000	However, now that I've played the console, and have had a ton of fun with Nintendo Land's multiplayer games,
6765000	6770000	I'm loving it. I just wish the catalog of games was bigger from the outset.
6770000	6776000	Dark Charger said, Nintendo continues to struggle with online, and despite a good number of launch titles,
6776000	6779000	there is really nothing worth buying the system for, yet.
6779000	6784000	Eventually there will hopefully be an F-Zero, Earthbound, yeah right, Metroid, or even better yet,
6784000	6786000	some new IPs that will make me want to pick it up.
6786000	6791000	Playing yesterday's games that I can already play on my PS3 or 360 isn't going to do it.
6791000	6797000	Doug T said, I'm holding off on buying the Wii U. I'm waiting for more high quality first party games.
6797000	6803000	I have a PS3, which is my favorite console, so when games are released on all three consoles, I will buy it for my PS3.
6803000	6808000	Also, I was disappointed with my Wii, so I'm waiting to see how the Wii U does over time.
6808000	6814000	AZHP said, before the console launched, I was really hopeful that Nintendo had figured out online.
6814000	6817000	Pause for Loki to scoff.
6817000	6822000	They figured out that it's there. How to use it, maybe.
6822000	6827000	Now that I'm hearing reports of how purchases are tied to the console instead of the Wii profile,
6827000	6832000	that there are separate wallets for Wii and Wii U online purchases that are on the same console,
6832000	6836000	and that profiles can't be transferred between consoles, I'm just disappointed in Nintendo.
6836000	6842000	The 360 did online right, and they did it seven years ago. Shame on Nintendo.
6842000	6846000	This answer is a little lengthy from dinner at Johnny's, so I'm not going to read the whole thing,
6846000	6852000	but basically said, you know, when Reggie said that they're going to cater to hardcore gamers, he was very excited.
6852000	6860000	Now that it's launched, my anticipation dropped considerably, partially because the console lacks focus on an achievement and trophy system.
6860000	6863000	Nintendo did this for the benefit of the developers.
6863000	6869000	And he kind of goes on to talk about how it's like a standard thing now, how Blizzard and all this does this.
6869000	6872000	I'm kind of disappointed they missed the boat on that, too.
6872000	6878000	Especially because, you know, on the 3DS, they have the whole accomplishments thing in the plaza.
6878000	6880000	I thought they were going this direction.
6880000	6883000	You know, it's... Oops.
6883000	6887000	We're not ready for the mailbag yet. Be quiet, music.
6887000	6890000	Sorry about that. Live radio, it's fun.
6892000	6896000	So, yeah, I, you know, I don't think it's like a deal breaker for the system.
6896000	6901000	It's disappointing, but what do you want to bet it's one of those things that just suddenly shows up later?
6901000	6903000	Let's see.
6905000	6908000	I'm looking at some of the comments in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
6908000	6913000	BlackWolf said, to be fair, Nintendo said that you'll be able to transfer profiles yourself soon.
6913000	6916000	And that they can already transfer them if you call them.
6916000	6922000	But yes, it's not there on launch day, because obviously we all bought multiple Wii U's and really want to be able to transfer our profiles in the first week.
6922000	6929000	BlackWolf, again, it's the hole they're building it as they go along, and how obvious is it?
6929000	6934000	I mean, I get it. You're right. It's not like we all have multiple Wii U's right now.
6934000	6939000	But, I mean, you know, people still make their decisions. Anyway.
6939000	6942000	Pete Garuno says, I was cautiously optimistic when it was announced.
6942000	6946000	Indifferent when more details emerged, but then I tried a demo unit and could see the potential.
6946000	6955000	One of my friends bought it on launch, and seeing that the social aspects of sending picture messages, asking other players for help on a specific point is kind of selling it for me.
6956000	6962000	Can't really justify the purchase at the moment, though, so it's currently on my wait for a major price reduction pile.
6962000	6969000	Let's see, going to Code Man. I haven't bought one yet, but I've played with one here, and they're at different electronic stores.
6969000	6974000	I have to say that the tech is pretty cool, and being a designer, the interface is well done as well.
6974000	6980000	What's keeping me from buying it, though, is I don't believe Nintendo is done with it, and tried to rush it out before the holiday season.
6980000	6984000	So until everything is working correctly, I would love to get my hands on one.
6984000	6988000	The only flaw in your logic I see is that, again, it's about the games.
6988000	6994000	It's not necessarily about the hardware, or even the firmware that's on said hardware.
6994000	7001000	I mean, if they're writing that as they go along, it's weird, but it's not really a deal breaker if Mario HD is still going to be Mario HD at the end of the day.
7001000	7003000	Think about that. That's all I'm saying.
7003000	7009000	But I can see what he's saying, though, because if you look at the Wii, remember the Wii came out, and then they're all,
7009000	7013000	Oh, MotionPlus, because we really wanted these controllers more sensitive.
7013000	7016000	So now we have Wii MotionPlus, and oh, you bought MotionPlus.
7016000	7020000	You know what? Now we have this fancy controller that already has it incorporated into it.
7020000	7027000	Yay. Oh, wait, now we need this other controller to do something, and you need that for this game.
7027000	7033000	That's fair. I understand that. The whole Wii MotionPlus, or the Vitality Sensor.
7033000	7035000	Ooh. LOL.
7035000	7037000	Okay, Google Plus time.
7037000	7040000	Evil says, hype level has generally been the same.
7040000	7043000	Actually, it's E3VL, but it says evil to me.
7043000	7045000	Hype level has been generally the same.
7045000	7048000	Nintendo's consoles will always be my go-to for first-party content.
7048000	7054000	My only concern is that if the Wii U will be my main console after Microsoft and Sony releases their next system,
7054000	7057000	seeing if Nintendo is consistent with quality of third-party ports.
7057000	7060000	Retertainment says my opinion has not changed.
7060000	7063000	I still have priorities that are higher on my list than buying a Wii U.
7063000	7066000	Not that I think a Wii U would be good buy or a bad buy.
7066000	7068000	I'd just rather save for a house right now.
7068000	7070000	I don't think I'm alone in this opinion.
7070000	7072000	Priorities are important. I'll give you that.
7072000	7077000	Rabababa says, now that I've played it a few days, the pad is better than expected.
7077000	7081000	It can do a lot of unique things. Best of all, it can look up hints on the internet without an extra device.
7081000	7084000	Very few games take advantage of it.
7084000	7088000	Flaco Jones says, I got a chance to play it for a few hours, and my opinion hasn't changed much.
7088000	7091000	I still think it's way overpriced when comparing it to the competition,
7091000	7096000	and the controller didn't sway me with the small selection of games that utilize it halfway decently.
7096000	7099000	Better games would definitely be the best way to change my mind.
7099000	7105000	Sean F. replied and said, I was never really excited. My PS3 and PSP are enough for me.
7105000	7109000	And Nick M. said, yeah, it went from being a polished, well-presented turd
7109000	7112000	to just a turd that sits in the corner of my living room.
7112000	7114000	So you bought one?
7114000	7118000	I'd be curious to hear more about you bought one and it's sitting in your living room unused.
7118000	7122000	I want to hear more about that. Please elaborate for later.
7122000	7125000	And I want to hear about your collection of polished turds. No, I'm kidding.
7125000	7131000	But I haven't heard of anybody who's bought one that said, yeah, it's already collecting dust in the corner.
7131000	7135000	I'm very curious to explore that further, so please send an email or something.
7135000	7140000	It's very possible it collected fingerprints because I'm sure it can collect fingerprints quite well.
7140000	7143000	Yeah, it does. Especially the black ones.
7143000	7146000	Alright, I read all the comments tonight because I'm nice.
7146000	7150000	Code Man is in chat, by the way, saying, to kind of clarify the comment,
7150000	7153000	I really want to check out Zombie You. And I do agree it's about the games, Rob,
7153000	7157000	but I do think they should get the console into control before a good title can be released.
7157000	7161000	In light of what Loki said, I get a little more what you're saying now.
7161000	7166000	Alright, couple stories for you guys and then we're going to get to the match game. Yay!
7166000	7171000	Alright, so we had a little bit of a comment before about talking about console generations
7171000	7175000	and kind of how they want things to change.
7175000	7179000	Well, THQ kind of got themselves into a little, well, it's not even really THQ,
7179000	7186000	but like the publisher, 4A, and I guess one of the THQ PR guys,
7186000	7192000	they've been trying to cover up, cover up I guess, defuse a situation that happened on Twitter.
7192000	7196000	I think it was on Twitter. Anyways, during an interview,
7197000	7203000	It's always Twitter. Take away people's PR people and like they say the dumbest shit.
7203000	7206000	That's why Twitter is great. Honestly.
7206000	7214000	So I think at least part of it took place on Twitter. It's basically talking about how the Wii U's CPU is slow.
7214000	7219000	And the quote is actually, the Wii U has a horrible, slow CPU.
7219000	7223000	And that's why they're saying that Metro Last Light is not going to be ported to the Wii U
7223000	7230000	is because the game system has a slow CPU and that it would just be impossible.
7230000	7237000	So, of course, THQ doesn't want to have this whole stigma of,
7237000	7243000	Oh, yeah, we just totally dogged in that system, but we want to put some games out on it.
7243000	7248000	And have Nintendo go, yeah, fuck you guys. You're not going on our system.
7248000	7251000	But if you think about it, THQ doesn't have a whole ton of,
7251000	7255000	I mean, they have a few games, I guess, that were launched. There was Darksiders 2.
7255000	7264000	And it's not out yet, but they've got Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy that they're porting over to that.
7264000	7269000	Not necessarily CPU intensive games. I mean, Darksiders may be a little bit, but you know,
7269000	7272000	Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune, not quite so much.
7273000	7279000	So, I don't know. It's interesting, though, they have basically the developer saying one thing
7279000	7285000	and then THQ is kind of like saying, Oh, well, it's not necessarily what they meant.
7285000	7288000	They're just saying that, oh, it's a very CPU intensive game.
7288000	7296000	And, you know, that, I don't know, maybe that this, you know, we use CPU wouldn't be able to handle this or something.
7296000	7300000	And then there's some other developers saying, well, you know, sounds like, you know,
7300000	7304000	they just couldn't even bother, you know, trying to port the game, you know, port over,
7304000	7310000	because it does have a faster GPU and a lot more RAM than the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360.
7310000	7317000	And of course, you know, it's this Gustav Halling saying, you know, yeah, you know, GPU and RAM's nice.
7317000	7320000	They have shaders and textures loaded, but physics and gameplay are on CPU.
7320000	7324000	So, I don't know. Will that be a problem? Possibly.
7324000	7330000	I don't know. It'd be interesting to see if we get, you know, if Grand Theft Auto 5 doesn't come to the Wii U
7330000	7336000	because it's got a slow CPU and can't load, you know, can't load the world fast enough or something like that.
7336000	7340000	Tigerclaw with a fair thought in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
7340000	7344000	Maybe the Wii U having a better GPU and a slow CPU is a tradeoff.
7344000	7350000	Nintendo wanted a system with really great graphics, but had to sacrifice CPU in order to bring the cost of the system down,
7350000	7354000	which is why some games like Arkham City have frame rate drops.
7354000	7361000	That's not good. I mean, I understand that you, if you're going to make sacrifices and you're not ready,
7361000	7365000	then you need to wait until that tech comes down in price.
7365000	7369000	You know, maybe when the console will be more finished, but that's going to be a problem
7369000	7374000	because if you're not willing to put the technology into it, you're going to have these next-gen systems come out
7374000	7376000	and they're just going to run circles around you.
7376000	7379000	Yeah. And I, you know, the frame rate drop in Arkham City,
7379000	7383000	I'm chalking that up to the fact that it's a port of a game that wasn't designed for the console.
7383000	7386000	I'm really curious what 2013's games are going to look like.
7386000	7388000	That's really what's going to define the Wii U, honestly.
7388000	7390000	And I'm sure the first-party games will look nice.
7390000	7392000	That's what they always kind of base their sales off of.
7392000	7393000	That's what always happens with Nintendo.
7393000	7397000	So, I mean, that'll look nice because they're developing for the system,
7397000	7401000	but you're going to have to wonder with some of these game systems that are already out there now
7401000	7404000	and you're going to have a Wii U version coming out at the same time.
7404000	7410000	And honestly, it's just, for me, it seems like it's like, okay, Nintendo told these publishers,
7410000	7414000	hey, by the way, you've got to have this gimmick that's thrown in there.
7414000	7421000	Like, for example, NBA 2K13, you can hold up the Wii U's game pad to see which of your, you know,
7421000	7427000	athletes or whatever are tired, which is funny because you can do the same thing on any of the other consoles
7427000	7431000	by pressing start and that same information comes up there.
7431000	7435000	It's like, it's not necessary to have that.
7435000	7439000	It's kind of the same thing that you have with some of these games that support Kinect,
7439000	7443000	where you have voice commands to do shit that you can do with the button press.
7443000	7448000	It's just, it's there to use the hardware so they can say, hey, we've got, you know,
7448000	7454000	this game that supports these extra features or whatever, but really these features aren't needed for this gameplay.
7454000	7456000	It's not adding anything really new.
7456000	7459000	And you're going to see a lot of this, I think, with the Wii U
7459000	7464000	because you saw a lot of this with the DS and the 3DS is that they don't know how to use this extra screen.
7464000	7468000	So you're going to have the stuff that was originally in the start menu on the other screen.
7468000	7471000	And yeah, it's cool that you don't have to stop gameplay,
7471000	7478000	but you're still going to have to take your eyes off the screen to fiddle with your inventory or something like that.
7478000	7483000	That, you know, pushing start and pausing the game so you have time to do that
7483000	7488000	might not be a bad thing instead of getting killed by something while you're having to look off screen.
7489000	7493000	Going to our chat room with some comments at live.vognetwork.com.
7493000	7496000	Rama says, I'm waiting for Mario Kart and Bayonetta 2.
7496000	7499000	And Dungeon Buster says, I'm mostly waiting on Bayonetta 2.
7499000	7504000	Rama says, by the way, I feel bad for people eBaying Wii U's. It's pointless.
7504000	7507000	Don't feel bad for them. Point and laugh at them.
7507000	7510000	I think it's hilarious that that whole scheme is backfiring
7510000	7515000	because those people that are buying consoles just to flip them and take them away from somebody who might really want them,
7515000	7517000	fuck them. I hope they lose a lot of money.
7517000	7521000	I hope they get stuck with all those Twinkies too and have to eat them.
7521000	7524000	So you know what? I feel no sympathy for them.
7524000	7528000	Unless it was like legitimately bought and maybe being flipped around
7528000	7532000	because a person decided, well, I don't want this polished turd sitting in the corner of my room anymore.
7532000	7535000	That's different, like a used Wii U already or whatever.
7535000	7540000	But like somebody who bought it just to try and flip it for an increased cost, middle finger to you.
7540000	7542000	I don't care that you're out $400.
7542000	7545000	They'll take them back to the store and get their money back, which is also bullshit.
7545000	7547000	But, you know, it is what it is.
7547000	7550000	Anyhow, piggybacking on this a little bit.
7550000	7555000	There's a piece in the New York Times that is kind of a, like, it's in the New York Times.
7555000	7561000	It's not really an opinion article, but it certainly kind of looks at, did Nintendo do the right thing?
7561000	7563000	Is the Wii U a good system?
7563000	7569000	And they go to a familiar name for a quote, which, you know, this little quote from the New York Times article is making its way around the game blogs.
7569000	7572000	And the quote is from Nolan Bushnell.
7572000	7573000	You recognize that name?
7573000	7574000	Yep.
7574000	7576000	Yeah, what did he do, Jamie?
7576000	7578000	Um, Chuck E. Cheese.
7578000	7580000	Yes, and Pong. Pong, too.
7580000	7581000	Yes.
7581000	7582000	Yes, and Chuck E. Cheese. That's important, too.
7582000	7587000	Well, quote, I am actually, I actually am baffled by it.
7587000	7590000	I don't think it's going to be a big success.
7590000	7592000	That's the quote.
7592000	7594000	Let's see, what else did he say here?
7594000	7600000	Quote, these things will continue to sputter along, but I really don't think they'll be of major import ever again.
7600000	7602000	It feels like the end of an era to me.
7602000	7608000	And, of course, that has all the game blogs going, Nolan Bushnell thinks the Wii U is an end of an era, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
7608000	7619000	And the, it's important to note that this article also kind of takes the stance of, that mobile, it's another one of those pieces that say mobile gaming's going to kill it all.
7619000	7622000	And, you know, Nintendo's just trying to get into tablet gaming with this.
7622000	7629000	And so, I don't know how I feel about all this, but it is interesting that Nolan Bushnell kind of throws his two cents out there.
7629000	7636000	Granted, it's one small quote out of what I hope was a larger interview, but is it the end of an era?
7636000	7640000	Is the Wii U the swan song of console gaming as we know it?
7640000	7641000	No.
7641000	7642000	I hardly think so.
7642000	7643000	No.
7644000	7652000	It's just stupid, I mean, because you're just, once again, you're kind of assuming that everyone's going to buy into it or not going to buy into it and go,
7652000	7654000	Oh, no, what am I going to game on now?
7654000	7659000	I just don't understand, like, why everyone thinks if these next-gen consoles fail that the whole industry's going to fail.
7659000	7661000	Hey, you have some consoles that still work.
7661000	7663000	You know what happens if a console fails?
7663000	7666000	Guess what, they just make games for other consoles.
7666000	7667000	It's just like the Vita.
7667000	7671000	If the Vita fails, guess what, they'll just make games for the 3DS and the DS.
7671000	7676000	Black Wolf kind of puts Nolan's words in another light here, saying,
7676000	7679000	No more TV gaming all going handheld mobile now.
7679000	7681000	That's what Nolan thinks.
7681000	7684000	More people play mobile games than ever played console games.
7684000	7691000	So maybe he's thinking, maybe Nolan is going this way because of the Wii U invoking the tablet thing,
7691000	7693000	kind of trying to get that piece of mobile game.
7693000	7698000	But for me, the part that people miss when they jump to that conclusion is that they're not putting,
7698000	7702000	I mean, the Wii U kind of can't do those same tablet games.
7702000	7706000	It really is a second screen that does have limited touch controls.
7706000	7708000	It just means you can play while you pee.
7708000	7710000	Partially.
7710000	7713000	Well, I told you about that shirt that I saw.
7713000	7715000	My iPhone has changed the way I go to the bathroom.
7715000	7716000	Right.
7716000	7717000	Well, I mean, think about it.
7717000	7719000	It's gaming anywhere that you want to.
7719000	7723000	And there's an attraction there, but I mean, I don't think it's the end of an era.
7723000	7727000	It's just an evolution of access.
7727000	7728000	Yeah.
7728000	7731000	There's only so much of, like, Cut the Rope and Angry Birds I can tolerate.
7731000	7734000	And those aren't the games I want to play when I'm sitting on my couch.
7734000	7739000	I guarantee there's going to be DS virtual console games by next year.
7739000	7740000	Oh.
7740000	7743000	Oh, with the whole, yeah, because since there is second screen anyway.
7743000	7745000	The screen is set up exactly like a DS.
7745000	7746000	Why not?
7746000	7753000	I think clearly it all indicates a return to animatronic restaurants.
7753000	7757000	Blackwill following up saying, well, what he's saying is that the new console isn't selling out.
7757000	7760000	So people have stopped buying new game consoles.
7760000	7761000	I think it is actually selling out.
7761000	7763000	It's just that they're replenishing a lot faster.
7763000	7768000	And Nintendo's also not advertising it because maybe, you know, and there's a lot of theories behind that.
7768000	7772000	But, you know, maybe to their benefit, they know they're going to be limited.
7772000	7775000	So why, I mean, the people that want to buy them already know about it.
7775000	7777000	So why have that advertising push behind it?
7778000	7784000	Let that grow a little more organically and then do the big advertising push in January, February when you need it.
7784000	7785000	Spend your gift card on a Wii U.
7785000	7787000	You know, that stuff.
7790000	7794000	Blackwolf continuing on trying to push the points here.
7794000	7799000	But Cut the Rope and Angry Birds are the games that majority of game buyers want to play.
7799000	7801000	We're the minority now.
7802000	7813000	Yes and no to me because I feel like the majority audience that's buying Cut the Rope and Angry Birds is an audience that didn't exist before.
7813000	7818000	Did people really switch from console gaming to exclusive mobile gaming?
7818000	7821000	I don't really think that's what happened.
7821000	7827000	Yeah, people into Angry Birds are, you know, people like my aunt who is well into her 60s.
7827000	7831000	And it's, you know, you're basically not your average gamer.
7831000	7835000	It's people getting into it who have never gotten into gaming before.
7835000	7839000	So, yeah, I can understand that, okay, that's where a lot of money is at and so forth.
7839000	7848000	But the console industry has been afloat for the years since 1978 with, say, the video game crash of 83, 84.
7848000	7851000	The video game industry has been afloat without that audience.
7851000	7855000	So, I don't know. Anyhow.
7855000	7858000	Alright, let's move on.
7858000	7863000	Bojikawa wants to say, I keep hearing that the Wii U hasn't been advertised.
7863000	7865000	I don't watch TV but I do watch Hulu.
7865000	7869000	I've seen the commercial for the Wii U many a times there the last couple of weeks.
7869000	7872000	It's also your audience is most likely to be aware of things like that.
7872000	7875000	Like that's still targeting like your tech crowd.
7875000	7880000	There's a big difference between running Wii U commercials there and running Wii U commercials on Saturday morning cartoons.
7880000	7882000	But anyway, I digress.
7882000	7884000	Let's play some match game.
7884000	7886000	We need to do match game.
7886000	7889000	We haven't done match game in forever on this show.
7891000	7897000	Alright, if you want to play match game in our chat room, let's see.
7897000	7906000	If you want to play match game, then type the name of the second town in Earthbound, our classic game of the week tonight.
7906000	7908000	It's really easy, you guys. It's really easy.
7908000	7911000	Type the name of that in the chat. We'll pick one player at random.
7911000	7914000	We'll also open the Skype line in just a minute.
7914000	7917000	But I want to introduce our celebrities tonight for match game.
7917000	7921000	Joining us for the match game tonight, Dark Sakura.
7921000	7923000	You've never heard her before.
7923000	7924000	Hi.
7924000	7927000	Also joining us for the match game tonight is Tech Master Loki.
7927000	7928000	Hi.
7928000	7931000	And I'm going to be joining you for the match game tonight.
7931000	7932000	Woo hoo.
7932000	7935000	Also joining us for the match game tonight, Say Hello 2.
7935000	7937000	It's your first time on the show. Be gentle.
7937000	7938000	Rachel.
7938000	7939000	Howdy.
7939000	7940000	How you doing?
7940000	7944000	Are you here to promote anything tonight? Is there a new movie coming out that you need to promote?
7944000	7945000	Or a book?
7945000	7947000	Uh, quick blog plug?
7947000	7948000	Yeah, sure.
7948000	7951000	Uh, greetings from the wasteland at WordPress.
7951000	7952000	There you go.
7952000	7954000	Uh, greetings from the wasteland. Sorry.
7954000	7959000	But it doesn't stop there. We have one more person playing match game with us tonight.
7959000	7961000	Say hello, everybody, to Alan.
7961000	7964000	Raspberry.
7964000	7965000	How are you doing, Alan?
7965000	7966000	Good.
7966000	7968000	Is there anything?
7968000	7970000	Are you doing your Carol Channing for us tonight?
7970000	7973000	Is that, uh, is that, uh, what you're going to do match game as?
7973000	7974000	No, I'm fine.
7974000	7976000	Do you have anything you want to promote tonight?
7976000	7978000	No.
7978000	7980000	Do you want to promote Fabulous Flank?
7980000	7982000	Oh, I'm really sorry about that.
7982000	7987000	I want to promote new internet that's not dropping out.
7987000	7989000	Yeah, apparently it's doing pretty well.
7989000	7990000	So, hooray to that.
7990000	7992000	Alright, we're going to open up the Skype line.
7992000	7996000	If you want to, remember, we're going to have one contestant in the chat room, one on the Skype line.
7996000	7999000	If you want to play match game, call us in the Skype line right now.
7999000	8004000	Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype, or 1-877-GAME-OLR.
8004000	8007000	So, we're going to pick one person on the phones and another from our chat room.
8007000	8010000	Uh, it looks like we have a few correct answers right now.
8010000	8015000	So, again, 1-877-GAME-OLR, username in Skype, Orange Lounge Radio.
8015000	8018000	While we wait for that call, because there is a little bit of a delay still,
8018000	8021000	and I think the delay got longer because of our setup,
8021000	8024000	but that's okay, I'd rather it be a longer delay and not drop out as much.
8024000	8029000	Um, so, anyhow, what I want to, oh, we got a call coming in.
8029000	8032000	Let's, let's see.
8032000	8035000	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
8035000	8037000	Hey, this is SSJ100 Matt.
8037000	8039000	Hey, SSJ100 Matt, how you doing?
8039000	8040000	Hi, how are you?
8040000	8042000	I feel like I haven't heard from you in a while.
8042000	8044000	You did alright through Sandy and all that?
8044000	8046000	I did, actually.
8046000	8047000	Good, good, I'm glad to hear it.
8047000	8049000	Well, are you ready to play some match game with us tonight?
8049000	8050000	Hells yeah.
8050000	8051000	Hells yeah.
8051000	8052000	Hells yeah.
8052000	8056000	Alright, it looks like we have only four people in chat that want to play along,
8056000	8058000	so, uh, let's see.
8058000	8061000	Alan, since you can't see chat, pick a number between one and four.
8061000	8062000	Two.
8062000	8066000	Two, meaning actdeft is going to play along in our chat room.
8066000	8071000	So, actdeft is our chatter tonight, so let me just send him a message.
8071000	8073000	Stand by.
8073000	8076000	Okay, so, here we go.
8077000	8082000	We have actdeft versus SSJ100 Matt, because we haven't played this in a long time.
8082000	8083000	Here's how it works.
8083000	8087000	We're going to read a question, and that question will have a blank.
8087000	8091000	Your job is to match the stars here in studio.
8091000	8093000	You're going to come up with the answer that goes in that blank,
8093000	8096000	and for every person that you match, you get a point.
8096000	8099000	Keep in mind, actdeft is playing against you in the chat room.
8099000	8101000	He'll be sending his answers over a private message,
8101000	8103000	and you will be giving yours over the phone,
8103000	8109000	but remember, please do not give your answers until we have a ding from everybody here in the studio.
8109000	8112000	All right, do you understand the rules, SSJ100 Matt?
8112000	8113000	I do.
8113000	8114000	All right, that's because you've played before.
8114000	8115000	All right, yes, Alan?
8115000	8116000	Yeah.
8116000	8118000	I just want to add that we're all really bad at this,
8118000	8120000	because I remember the last time we played this,
8120000	8123000	and not a single one of us matched shit with anyone.
8123000	8125000	That's the joke.
8125000	8127000	No, it's not.
8127000	8129000	All right, here we go.
8129000	8133000	Let's get into tonight's first question.
8133000	8135000	Drum roll, please.
8135000	8136000	Here we go.
8136000	8137000	Tonight's first question.
8137000	8139000	Four questions tonight.
8139000	8143000	As Space Harrier's biggest fan,
8143000	8148000	Jamie is very excited about Space Harrier coming to the 3DS.
8148000	8152000	She found it odd, though, that in her honor,
8152000	8155000	the designers changed the opening line from
8155000	8158000	welcome to the fantasy zone, get ready,
8158000	8169000	to welcome to the blank, get ready.
8169000	8170000	As Space Harrier's biggest fan,
8170000	8173000	Jamie is very excited about Space Harrier coming to the 3DS.
8173000	8176000	She found it odd, though, that in her honor,
8176000	8179000	the designers changed the opening line from
8179000	8181000	welcome to the fantasy zone, get ready,
8181000	8184000	to welcome to the...
8184000	8185000	What the fuck was that?
8185000	8188000	Welcome to the blank, get ready.
8188000	8190000	I'm sorry you've been beeped.
8190000	8194000	Apparently, I got censored by this crappy Think Music MP3,
8194000	8195000	so we'll pause that.
8195000	8199000	All right, so I'm going to say ding.
8199000	8200000	Ding.
8200000	8201000	Ding.
8201000	8202000	Ding, Alan.
8202000	8203000	Ding.
8203000	8204000	Ding.
8204000	8205000	Okay, so we have five.
8205000	8206000	Okay, I see the answer in chat.
8206000	8209000	SSJ100, Matt, do you have an answer?
8209000	8210000	I do.
8210000	8211000	Welcome to the...
8211000	8213000	Welcome to the Citadel.
8213000	8216000	Welcome to the Citadel, get ready.
8216000	8218000	Ah, going for the Mass Effect joke there.
8218000	8220000	Well, let's check in with the woman herself.
8220000	8222000	They're changing it from welcome to the fantasy zone,
8222000	8224000	get ready, to welcome to the...
8224000	8225000	Fantasy zone.
8225000	8226000	What?
8226000	8230000	PH8, fantasy zone, the RPG.
8230000	8233000	Oh, look at you, clever gal.
8233000	8237000	Because I'm fucking clever.
8237000	8239000	Somebody put that down as the quote of the night,
8239000	8241000	because I'm fucking clever.
8241000	8242000	Rachel.
8242000	8243000	Frenzy from school.
8243000	8245000	How well do we know Jamie?
8245000	8246000	Welcome to the...
8246000	8247000	Wii U.
8247000	8250000	Welcome to the Wii U, get ready.
8250000	8251000	Wait, what was...
8251000	8252000	Act Def.
8252000	8253000	Oh, I'm so sorry.
8253000	8254000	Act Def.
8254000	8255000	I'm not ignoring Act Def.
8255000	8257000	Act Def said...
8257000	8258000	Garrus zone.
8258000	8259000	I'm a little rusty.
8259000	8260000	I'm out of practice.
8260000	8261000	We haven't played this in over a year.
8261000	8264000	Welcome to the Garrus zone, get ready.
8264000	8267000	So two Mass Effect answers, but a little different there.
8267000	8269000	So we have welcome to the Citadel, welcome to the Garrus zone.
8269000	8271000	All right, Loki, welcome to the...
8271000	8272000	I have Citadel.
8272000	8273000	Did you really?
8273000	8274000	I did.
8274000	8276000	A point for SSJ 100 mass.
8276000	8277000	Look at that, Alan.
8277000	8279000	Look at that, a point.
8279000	8280000	I have it.
8280000	8281000	It's typed on my screen and everything.
8281000	8283000	All right, there it is.
8283000	8284000	All right.
8284000	8290000	Speaking of Alan, who says that these things always end in a 0-0 tie, welcome to the...
8290000	8291000	Pinkberry.
8291000	8293000	That was a good answer.
8293000	8295000	I should have said Pinkberry.
8295000	8296000	That is a good answer.
8296000	8298000	Welcome to the Pinkberry, get ready.
8298000	8303000	And my answer was welcome to the Normandy, get ready.
8303000	8304000	So close.
8304000	8305000	So close.
8305000	8306000	So close.
8306000	8307000	But you know what?
8307000	8309000	I'm not taking pity because you already got a point.
8309000	8310000	So there it is.
8310000	8313000	The score all in the lead there.
8313000	8315000	SSJ 100 mass has one point.
8315000	8317000	Act Def has zero.
8317000	8319000	All right, here we go.
8319000	8321000	On to the next question.
8321000	8322000	Question number two.
8322000	8325000	You feeling good about that lead, SSJ 100 mass?
8325000	8326000	I'm feeling great.
8326000	8327000	All right, feeling great.
8327000	8330000	Here we go to question number two.
8330000	8340000	THQ might have said that the Wii U has a horrible slow CPU, but Loki is on record saying that
8340000	8345000	the Wii U has a horrible slow blank.
8348000	8354000	THQ might have said that the Wii U has a horrible slow CPU, but Loki is on record saying that
8354000	8358000	the Wii U has a horrible slow blank.
8363000	8364000	Ding.
8364000	8365000	Ding.
8365000	8366000	Ding.
8368000	8371000	I don't know if I can make this smaller now.
8371000	8373000	Has a horrible slow.
8373000	8374000	Ding.
8374000	8375000	I'll just.
8375000	8376000	I'll do it live.
8376000	8378000	No, you have to write the answer down.
8378000	8379000	All right, fine.
8379000	8382000	Or else Alan's going to come over there and say, you rigged it.
8382000	8383000	You rigged it.
8385000	8389000	Alan is the Mass Effect po-po, you know.
8389000	8390000	All right.
8390000	8391000	Right, Alan?
8392000	8393000	All right.
8393000	8394000	Okay, here we go.
8394000	8395000	Does that mean he's seasick?
8395000	8396000	We have an answer.
8396000	8397000	Shut up.
8397000	8400000	We have an answer for MacDeft, so that means we are ready to go.
8400000	8402000	SSJ 100, Matt, you have that answer in your mind?
8402000	8403000	Yep, I do.
8403000	8404000	All right, here we go.
8404000	8409000	THQ might have said that the Wii U has a horrible slow CPU, but Loki is on record saying that
8409000	8412000	the Wii U has a horrible slow.
8412000	8414000	Rendering of tits slash boobs.
8414000	8416000	Rendering of boobs.
8416000	8417000	Tits.
8417000	8418000	Okay, good.
8418000	8424000	ActDeft says a horrible slow maker or company.
8424000	8425000	He's saying Nintendo is slow.
8425000	8426000	Get it?
8426000	8427000	I get it.
8427000	8428000	I get it.
8428000	8429000	We'll see.
8429000	8430000	We'll see how that pays off.
8430000	8431000	All right.
8431000	8433000	Has a horrible slow dark soccer.
8433000	8434000	Boob jiggle.
8434000	8436000	Boob jiggle.
8436000	8438000	Oh, that's really close.
8438000	8439000	I'd say half a point.
8439000	8440000	That's really close.
8440000	8444000	And I wouldn't even say that a slow boob jiggle would be a bad thing.
8444000	8450000	Alan is the unofficial, I almost said Mass Effect Judge, as the unofficial match game
8450000	8451000	judge.
8451000	8453000	Do you think boob jiggle is a match with boob rendering?
8453000	8454000	I will allow it.
8454000	8456000	I will allow it.
8456000	8458000	Two points for SSJ 100, Matt.
8458000	8460000	No points for ActDeft.
8460000	8461000	That's okay, ActDeft.
8461000	8462000	That's okay.
8462000	8464000	Rachel, a horrible slow.
8464000	8465000	Booty.
8465000	8466000	Booty.
8466000	8469000	Booty and boobies are very different.
8469000	8470000	Some people are tits.
8470000	8471000	Some people are ass.
8471000	8473000	So those are two different answers for sure.
8473000	8475000	If we gave them one, we're not going to give them both.
8475000	8476000	All right.
8476000	8477000	Loki.
8477000	8485000	Loki, you are on record saying the Wii U has a horrible slow.
8485000	8487000	Adoption of online protocols.
8487000	8491000	Adoption of online protocols.
8491000	8494000	Good answer, but not a match.
8494000	8497000	Has a horrible slow.
8497000	8498000	Bacon grilling peripheral.
8498000	8500000	Bacon grilling peripheral.
8500000	8502000	A very good Loki answer, but not a match.
8502000	8506000	No, we don't want a horrible bacon grilling.
8506000	8512000	And I said the Wii U has a horrible slow ego.
8512000	8513000	Ego.
8513000	8514000	Not a match.
8514000	8515000	Not a match.
8515000	8517000	All right, so the score is two to zero.
8517000	8519000	ActDeft, you still have two questions.
8519000	8521000	You still have two questions.
8521000	8523000	You could tie it up easy if you get one on each of these.
8523000	8527000	All right, here we go to question number three.
8528000	8530000	Question number three.
8530000	8537000	Rob was shocked to hear that the R4 cartridges were being banned everywhere.
8537000	8542000	Upon hearing of the latest ban, Rob shouted at Allen,
8542000	8547000	quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of blank.
8551000	8556000	Rob shouted at Allen, quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of blank.
8556000	8558000	I don't even know what to say for this one.
8558000	8564000	In my stash of, OK, I got one.
8564000	8568000	Quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of blank.
8568000	8570000	Loki says ding.
8570000	8571000	Rachel's still thinking.
8571000	8572000	Allen says ding.
8572000	8573000	That's all right, Rachel.
8573000	8574000	I know we just met earlier tonight.
8574000	8576000	It might be hard to think of a way to razz me.
8576000	8578000	She's looking around.
8578000	8580000	What the hell is this guy like?
8580000	8581000	It's all right.
8581000	8582000	You can make something up.
8582000	8583000	They'll never know.
8583000	8584000	All right.
8584000	8585000	Ding.
8585000	8586000	All right, ding it is.
8586000	8589000	All right, and I see a ding from actdeft.
8589000	8591000	SSJ100, Matt, you ready to answer?
8591000	8592000	Yeah, I got one.
8592000	8593000	All right, here we go.
8593000	8596000	Rob was shocked to hear that the R4 cartridges were being banned everywhere.
8596000	8605000	Upon hearing of the latest ban, Rob shouted at Allen, quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of blank.
8605000	8609000	Rob shouted at Allen, quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of blank.
8609000	8615000	Rob shouted at Allen, quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of blank.
8615000	8621000	I'm going to go with a classic match game answer with non-silon-occupied Caprica.
8621000	8627000	Non-silon-occupied Caprica in my stash of non-silon-occupied Caprica.
8627000	8633000	I don't know how well that's going to go over with somebody who is brand new to the show tonight, but we'll see what happens.
8633000	8637000	All right, actdeft says dating sims and hentai games.
8637000	8643000	You have to understand, there are so many people that are like, what does non-silon-occupied Caprica even mean?
8643000	8645000	I can't even say it right anymore.
8645000	8646000	It's an old-ass joke.
8646000	8647000	It's a really funny joke.
8647000	8652000	Like, it would have been just about as funny as if he said, in my stash of big black cocks, but he didn't.
8652000	8664000	All right, anyhow, quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of...
8664000	8665000	Dark Sakura?
8665000	8666000	Big black cocks?
8666000	8668000	Big black cocks!
8668000	8671000	Oh, and I didn't let him change the answer.
8671000	8676000	All right, quick, hide the... Did I really read your mind?
8676000	8678000	All right, quick.
8678000	8683000	What do you expect? Someone that was talking about, you know, drawings of vaginas earlier.
8683000	8685000	That's true, that's true. She's got porn on the...
8685000	8690000	It sounds like actdeft's answer of dating sims and hentai games almost was a match there.
8690000	8692000	Dating sims and hentai games.
8692000	8696000	All right, Rachel, my stash of...
8696000	8697000	Twilight books.
8697000	8702000	Twilight books? Get out!
8702000	8705000	I don't own Twilight books. You made that up.
8705000	8708000	I could have said Fifty Shades of Grey. Look on the bright side.
8708000	8709000	That's true. All right, I'll give you that.
8709000	8712000	Really? Does Rob look like a 14-year-old Mormon girl?
8712000	8715000	Well...
8715000	8717000	If only it were a TV show.
8717000	8721000	All right, Loki, quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of...
8721000	8722000	Cat pictures.
8722000	8726000	Cat pictures! Good answer. Not a match.
8726000	8730000	Alan, quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of...
8730000	8733000	New, still in box, President Cat merchandise.
8733000	8738000	New, still in box, President Cat merchandise. Not a match.
8738000	8741000	And my answer, the most important one, clearly.
8741000	8747000	Quick, hide the R4 cartridges in my stash of... Disney pins?
8747000	8749000	That's very accurate.
8749000	8752000	I know. Sorry I played it straight on that one.
8752000	8755000	All right. Womp womp. All right.
8755000	8758000	Act Deaf, it is still 2-0.
8758000	8761000	Let's see, Shane is in chat. Shane Alinko in chat says,
8761000	8764000	I own the Twilight books and I'm not a 14-year-old Mormon girl.
8764000	8765000	Yes, you are.
8765000	8767000	You make me a very sad person on chat.
8767000	8770000	Act Deaf says, fuck, I was gonna say President Cat.
8770000	8772000	Woulda, coulda, shoulda.
8772000	8775000	Dating Sims is a pretty good answer, though, even though I don't own any.
8775000	8776000	All right.
8776000	8778000	I have Dating Sims. They're yowie.
8778000	8781000	Here's your chance to close the gap, Act Deaf.
8781000	8784000	You feeling pretty good about this, SSJ100 Matt?
8784000	8785000	I'm feeling golden.
8785000	8788000	You're feeling golden. Here you go. One more question.
8788000	8791000	Here we go. Last question.
8791000	8799000	Peter Molyneux recently advertised Goddess on the Cube in Curiosity.
8799000	8807000	It turns out that what Peter put inside the Cube is actually just an ad for blank.
8807000	8809000	Blank.
8809000	8812000	Y'all know Curiosity, what's in the Cube?
8812000	8823000	Well, Goddess was advertised on the Cube and it turns out what Peter put in the Cube is actually just an ad for blank.
8823000	8827000	What is in the Cube is actually just an ad for blank.
8827000	8829000	Ding in a major way.
8829000	8831000	Ding.
8831000	8833000	Ding.
8833000	8835000	Ding.
8836000	8839000	Yes, I did. In a major way. Way to listen, Rob.
8839000	8841000	I wasn't listening to you because I was thinking of an answer.
8841000	8845000	Even though I think of the questions before the show, I don't think of the answers.
8845000	8848000	You know what? That's a likely story. I don't believe you.
8848000	8851000	All right. An ad for blank.
8851000	8856000	All right. Looks like Act Deaf is Ding and SSJ100 Matt, you ready with an answer?
8856000	8857000	Yep.
8857000	8861000	All right. Peter Molyneux recently advertised Goddess on the Cube in Curiosity.
8861000	8867000	It turns out that what Peter put in the Cube is actually just an ad for...
8867000	8868000	Ovaltine.
8868000	8872000	Ovaltine.
8872000	8875000	I like Ovaltine.
8875000	8876000	That's great.
8876000	8878000	That's a far better answer than you guys deserve.
8878000	8879000	That is true, yes.
8879000	8883000	All right. Well, let's go to Act Deaf. He has an answer too, you know.
8883000	8887000	What he put in the Cube is actually just an ad for...
8888000	8893000	Hoping that we'll be ready to self-promote here on OLR tonight.
8893000	8896000	So an ad for the VoG network in the Cube. Let's take a look.
8896000	8897000	DarkSakura.
8897000	8901000	What he put in the Cube is actually just an ad for...
8901000	8902000	Propel.
8902000	8903000	Propel.
8903000	8905000	I'm going old school tonight.
8905000	8909000	Oh, you guys and the references. All right. Good answer. Not a match.
8909000	8913000	All right. What Peter put in the Cube is actually just an ad for...
8913000	8914000	Rachel?
8914000	8916000	Goddess catch them all.
8916000	8919000	Goddess catch them all.
8921000	8924000	It burns, doesn't it? It's not a good burn.
8924000	8929000	Ladies and gentlemen, who knew that Rachel was the 24th Magus, everybody?
8929000	8931000	Here in studio.
8931000	8933000	I will explain this to you.
8933000	8936000	Yeah, you'll have to explain that later. All right.
8937000	8939000	Is she going to break a soundboard table now?
8939000	8940000	She might.
8940000	8943000	I don't know. This table's a lot sturdier than the one that Drew broke.
8943000	8947000	After nobody matches her, she might just flip the table over. We'll see.
8947000	8952000	All right, Loki, what Peter put in the Cube is actually just an ad for...
8952000	8956000	You know, I don't know how to pronounce this, but I'm going to try to. It's...
8956000	8957000	Schrodinger.
8959000	8961000	Would it be Schrodinger or Schrodinger's cat?
8961000	8965000	No. Everyone likes cats, so it's just Schrodinger.
8965000	8967000	See how he likes it!
8968000	8973000	Clever answer. That's too intellectual for you, Loki. All right.
8974000	8976000	Should I have said penises or like, you know...
8976000	8979000	You are a Mensa member after all. All right.
8979000	8981000	It is just an ad for...
8981000	8982000	Alan?
8982000	8985000	Pure unsubstantiated hype the video game.
8985000	8989000	Pure unsubstantiated hype the video game.
8989000	8991000	You know, that's not as good as they say.
8991000	8997000	All right. And lastly, my answer, we'll see if it's a match for Act Deft with the VOG Network or...
8997000	9000000	Whatever Matt said, I can't even remember now.
9000000	9001000	Ovaltine.
9001000	9002000	Ovaltine.
9003000	9008000	Here it is. Peter Molyneux recently advertised Goddess on the Cube in curiosity.
9008000	9013000	It turns out that what Peter put in the Cube is actually just an ad for...
9013000	9014000	Douche.
9015000	9016000	Good night, everybody!
9017000	9021000	That's gonna conclude the match game tonight.
9021000	9024000	SSJ 100 Matt wins!
9026000	9028000	In a score of 2 to 0.
9028000	9030000	Alan, 2 to 0.
9030000	9031000	All right.
9033000	9037000	Act Deft, thank you so much for playing, but sorry you're a loser. There's the door.
9037000	9041000	SSJ 100 Matt, congratulations. You win.
9041000	9046000	And as the winner, you get to pimp or promote anything you want to on the program tonight.
9048000	9052000	Well, I don't really have anything to promote, so I'm just gonna promote the VOG Network.
9052000	9057000	Oh, it's like the ad was really in the center after all.
9057000	9058000	All right.
9058000	9059000	Feel the love.
9059000	9060000	You're so nice.
9060000	9062000	Oh, the feels. The feels. All right.
9062000	9063000	All the feels.
9063000	9069000	SSJ 100 Matt, congratulations. You won the first match game on OLR in like a year and a half, so walk away with that trophy.
9069000	9072000	And maybe somebody will try to take it from you in 2013.
9072000	9073000	We'll see.
9073000	9075000	All right. Have a good night, buddy.
9075000	9076000	Have a good night, guys.
9076000	9077000	All right. Bye.
9077000	9079000	All right. That was fun. That was fun.
9079000	9084000	Thank you, Alan, for walking in and doing a cameo. Not like I pressured you into it or anything.
9084000	9085000	You're welcome.
9085000	9088000	By the way, the taquitos were A+. Thank you.
9088000	9090000	It was quite delicious. Thank you.
9090000	9092000	Alan takes good care of us during the show. We appreciate it.
9092000	9093000	All right.
9093000	9094000	All right.
9094000	9097000	Let us move on with a few more stories.
9097000	9103000	And then we're going to open up the Skype line for regular calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR.
9103000	9106000	Or, of course, our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
9106000	9113000	Oh, we have more stuff we've got to get to before we get to the stories, though, such as the mailbag.
9116000	9120000	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com is the place to send us your e-mails.
9120000	9124000	And DarkSakura will dive into the mailbag headfirst and read a few e-mails that tickles your fancy.
9124000	9126000	Ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.
9126000	9127000	Okay.
9127000	9129000	What's inside the mailbag?
9129000	9130000	Cock.
9130000	9131000	Okay.
9131000	9132000	Um, have you...
9132000	9137000	Okay, this comes from Alex. I'm just going to say Alex.
9137000	9142000	Have you ever tried placing your games in a numbered list and picking a number at random?
9142000	9149000	I've been surprised on many occasions to find out how much fun I've had playing an old game or playing a game I thought I was not in the mood for, thanks to this method.
9150000	9151000	One more thing.
9151000	9154000	MMORPGs get a number for each character.
9155000	9156000	Okay.
9156000	9158000	Take care and happy gaming.
9158000	9159000	I've never done that.
9159000	9160000	No, I get what he's saying.
9160000	9165000	He's saying, like, you know, for the MMOs you play, give a number to each of your characters and throw them in the mix.
9165000	9168000	For the record, making something plural, you do not use an apostrophe.
9168000	9169000	Stop.
9169000	9170000	You know what?
9170000	9172000	I think it's a neat idea, actually.
9172000	9174000	I think the idea is, like, really rad.
9174000	9179000	Can you imagine if you had a spreadsheet of every game in the vault, one through, like, a thousand?
9179000	9186000	We tried this and got so wiped out trying to list every freaking game that we own that, no.
9186000	9188000	It spread out to imaginary numbers.
9188000	9190000	There was algebra involved and it wasn't pretty.
9191000	9195000	You had to use the E plus 10 and all that stuff to get the games in there.
9195000	9196000	I think it's a great idea.
9196000	9199000	Like, I think that would make an awesome, like, marathon idea.
9199000	9203000	Like, you know, I know, OLR, we've been teasing the idea of doing a marathon for, like, ten years.
9203000	9209000	But I think it would be great to, like, number all the games in the vault and then have our donators pick a random number.
9209000	9211000	And that would be the game we'd be forced to play.
9211000	9213000	Wouldn't that be fun, DarkSagra?
9213000	9214000	Yes.
9214000	9215000	Like, can you imagine if somebody-
9215000	9217000	As long as we don't put shit on the list.
9217000	9218000	Or, like, ET?
9219000	9220000	Do you own ET?
9221000	9222000	I think I do, actually.
9222000	9223000	Now, here's the other question.
9223000	9225000	Would each copy of Space Harrier get a number?
9227000	9228000	All right.
9228000	9229000	Next email.
9230000	9231000	Next up.
9232000	9233000	Oh, that was the one I just read.
9235000	9236000	They're very small.
9237000	9239000	This one comes from Will.
9240000	9244000	I strangely enjoy when Rob breaks into the show to give the VoG passphrase.
9244000	9245000	He sounds so serious.
9246000	9247000	That's it?
9248000	9251000	Today's password is cheeseball.
9251000	9252000	That's not really the password.
9252000	9253000	No.
9253000	9254000	I don't pick that.
9254000	9255000	The password-
9255000	9256000	It's randomly generated.
9256000	9261000	Yeah, the passphrases get picked for me after the show with a little thing that Bobby wrote.
9261000	9263000	Today's passcode is cock.
9263000	9264000	No, it's not.
9264000	9265000	Don't put that in the box.
9265000	9267000	She doesn't know it, because we don't know it's allowed in the show.
9267000	9268000	What if the weapon did pop up?
9268000	9272000	It's not going to have cock, because Bobby filtered all the adult words off of it, I'm sure.
9272000	9273000	Aw.
9273000	9274000	Dang it, Bobby.
9274000	9277000	It'll be spelled with a zero and a five in place of the S.
9277000	9278000	For April-
9278000	9279000	You know what, Bobby?
9279000	9280000	Remind me.
9280000	9285000	April Fool's Day next year, people who put naughty words in the box unlock a bar of soap trophy.
9285000	9286000	Can we make that happen?
9286000	9287000	All right.
9287000	9288000	Anyhow-
9288000	9289000	You got four months to work on it.
9289000	9293000	Here's a chance for me to re-pimp this, though, because we haven't talked about it in a while.
9293000	9298000	If you listen to the shows live at vognetwork.com, you can check into the show as the show is
9298000	9302000	happening and get your five vog points, which go for the loot.
9302000	9304000	And what do vog points get you?
9304000	9305000	Absolutely nothing.
9305000	9306000	It's just a fun-
9306000	9308000	But what does Foursquare and Facebook check-ins give you?
9308000	9310000	It's just a fun little game within a game.
9310000	9314000	Someday, there may be more to come from it in 2013.
9314000	9317000	We're throwing around ideas.
9317000	9325000	But for those that can't join us live, what we do is we put a passphrase somewhere in the show.
9325000	9327000	You might have already heard it earlier in the show.
9327000	9329000	You might hear it still coming up.
9329000	9331000	It's always in a random point in the show.
9331000	9335000	If you put that passphrase into a box you see on the front page of vognetwork.com,
9335000	9339000	you can get those same five points that you would have got if you listened live.
9339000	9340000	It's like you get the same credit.
9340000	9343000	So please note, you can't get the five points twice.
9343000	9348000	Although you still can check in just to register yourself as you listen to the podcast
9348000	9350000	and you listen live just to see if there were any differences.
9350000	9352000	But you don't get the extra points.
9352000	9354000	But anyhow, we hope you'll play along.
9354000	9356000	It's just a fun thing to do at vognetwork.com.
9356000	9360000	And we do look to adding some fun little note prizes.
9360000	9365000	Like maybe the person with the most amount of points will get to program the station for a day.
9365000	9367000	I'm throwing it out there.
9367000	9368000	These aren't actual things.
9368000	9369000	But we're looking at doing things like that.
9369000	9372000	Translated to give Bobby a migraine for a day.
9374000	9378000	And Tigerclaw and Act Deaf in chat remind us bragging rights is what you get.
9378000	9379000	Bragging rights.
9379000	9383000	I like note prizes like Marvel used to do where the people would just get a blank envelope.
9383000	9388000	I think maybe in 2013 what we should do, especially since we're all getting into,
9388000	9391000	like you're doing crocheting and all these different projects,
9391000	9396000	we should give our leaderboard leader every month a homemade prize.
9397000	9398000	That means I have to make it.
9398000	9400000	No, no. It doesn't have to be you every time. You can do one.
9400000	9402000	We can make something out of popsicle sticks.
9402000	9404000	But remember, there's more than just us on VOG.
9404000	9405000	Hello.
9405000	9407000	It could be like one week.
9407000	9412000	It could be maybe Brad from Pod Culture could send something homemade.
9412000	9413000	This is what we should do.
9413000	9415000	Have a contest. It starts in January.
9416000	9422000	Whoever gets the top of a leaderboard the most times in the period of a year
9422000	9424000	gets an orange beanie crocheted by me.
9426000	9428000	That could be one of the prizes.
9428000	9430000	No, I'm making this a contest.
9430000	9433000	We need to talk about this off-air first.
9433000	9434000	We've got to coordinate it with Bob.
9434000	9435000	Bobby is the game master after all.
9435000	9437000	He might be like, wait.
9437000	9438000	So we'll talk off-air.
9438000	9440000	But yes, we're going to keep enhancing the game.
9440000	9441000	It's always in progress.
9441000	9442000	Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
9442000	9444000	Always in beta, just like Gmail.
9444000	9446000	Last email.
9446000	9449000	This comes from Travis.
9450000	9451000	Donovan?
9451000	9453000	No, not Donovan.
9453000	9454000	Hey, gang.
9454000	9455000	Haven't wrote or called in a while.
9455000	9458000	Thought I would drop a line and say, hey, I got a Wii U over the weekend
9458000	9460000	and heard Rob talking about his last episode.
9460000	9462000	I'm happy with it so far.
9462000	9467000	I have an 8-Yo, sorry, year-old, and he absolutely loves it.
9467000	9470000	Also, friends and family have a blast with it too.
9470000	9474000	Just wondering, after a week of having it, what do you think?
9474000	9476000	Rob, get out of the fridge.
9476000	9477000	Come answer the question.
9477000	9478000	I wanted an Oreo.
9478000	9479000	I want an Oreo.
9479000	9480000	Thank you.
9481000	9483000	You want an Oreo too, Rachel?
9483000	9484000	I'll get you an Oreo later.
9484000	9485000	I'm good.
9485000	9486000	All right.
9487000	9489000	Well, I talked about the Wii U at the top of the show.
9489000	9491000	I don't think I have a lot else to add.
9491000	9494000	I am not disappointed with my investment.
9494000	9499000	But, again, how important is Mario and Nintendo Land
9499000	9500000	and some of these like ZombiU?
9500000	9502000	How important are those games to you?
9502000	9505000	If you think you can wait on those games until 2013, then wait.
9505000	9507000	But if you want to play them now,
9507000	9510000	and you have the financial resources available to play them now,
9510000	9511000	then go get one.
9511000	9512000	It's fun.
9513000	9514000	Keep talking.
9516000	9517000	No, I'm done.
9517000	9518000	That's all I have to say on the Wii U.
9518000	9520000	I talked for like 40 minutes during part A.
9520000	9521000	Okay.
9522000	9524000	Oreos from the fridge are the best.
9524000	9525000	Okay.
9525000	9526000	Matt, you want one?
9526000	9527000	No.
9527000	9529000	I do not want an Oreo.
9529000	9533000	I'm pretty excited about Lego City, a new Zelda, and an F-Zero game.
9533000	9535000	Being a PlayStation fanboy and a PC gamer,
9535000	9539000	I have to say I'm not blown away, but still very impressed with it.
9539000	9540000	Those are all in caps.
9540000	9541000	How am I supposed to emote that?
9543000	9545000	Oh, by the way, my friend requested you,
9545000	9547000	but we'll have to do it again under a different name.
9547000	9549000	Long story short, I had to get a replacement system
9549000	9551000	as my first one I purchased was faulty.
9551000	9552000	Quoty.
9552000	9553000	Faulty.
9554000	9555000	That sucks.
9555000	9557000	You had some bad luck.
9557000	9558000	Done.
9561000	9566000	Jason is quick to correct me in the chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
9566000	9569000	Gmail hasn't been in beta for more than a few years now.
9569000	9570000	Whatever.
9571000	9574000	We've been in beta for like, what, eight months?
9575000	9577000	Gmail was in beta for like six years.
9578000	9579000	We have a ways to go.
9579000	9580000	Hyperbole what now?
9582000	9583000	All right.
9584000	9586000	Let's get into the FUs of the week.
9600000	9601000	This is fucked up.
9602000	9604000	Now Rachel, since you're new to the FUs of the week,
9604000	9606000	I don't know if Jamie told you about this in the car ride,
9606000	9608000	but this is the part of the show where we just get to,
9608000	9609000	we just get to rant.
9609000	9610000	Why?
9610000	9612000	Well, because we have your attention.
9612000	9614000	And when I have your attention, I like to rant.
9614000	9615000	So it's the FUs of the week.
9615000	9616000	Uh, Dersogra.
9616000	9618000	I don't particularly have an FU.
9618000	9621000	Um, I have a thank you to someone for saving me the trouble
9621000	9623000	of doing what I planned on doing anyway.
9625000	9626000	Hiding a body?
9627000	9628000	No.
9628000	9629000	All right.
9629000	9630000	Uh, Loki.
9630000	9633000	I have to do the whole ride over here because for some reason,
9633000	9636000	like everybody was out to try to kill me or something on the road.
9636000	9639000	Like there's a dude, I hate it when they do this.
9639000	9641000	Like when there's people waiting to like pull out of an,
9641000	9646000	either like a plaza or like a driveway or something like that.
9646000	9649000	And they're like kind of trying to time it so that they just pull out
9649000	9653000	right after you pass, except they have no sense of timing whatsoever.
9653000	9655000	So it's like, oh, hey, you're coming.
9655000	9656000	I'm backing out right now.
9656000	9659000	You know, and you have to dive into the other lane.
9659000	9661000	So I had that happen twice on the way here.
9661000	9665000	And then there was, um, what was the other dude?
9665000	9667000	Oh, some other dude that was drifting into my lane.
9667000	9670000	It's just paying fucking attention, people.
9670000	9673000	Seriously, you're going to kill somebody and hopefully not me.
9674000	9678000	Uh, my FU of the week goes to Oreos for being so delicious and addicting.
9678000	9679000	Oh my God.
9679000	9681000	But no, the other thing about that is I want to give an FU to the fact
9681000	9685000	that I never got to have the birthday cake Oreos because they disappeared
9685000	9689000	from shelves so fast and, and real problems, guys.
9689000	9691000	I never got to have the candy corn Oreos because they disappeared
9691000	9693000	from shelves so fast.
9693000	9695000	Why can't I make these special Oreos if I can't find them?
9695000	9699000	And while I'm at it, FU to the fact that there are no pumpkin kisses
9699000	9700000	this, this year.
9700000	9702000	That is a travesty.
9702000	9704000	True travesty.
9704000	9707000	Didn't you hold on to like a pack of those for like six months?
9707000	9709000	I did, and they were still delicious.
9709000	9710000	Sorry, not sorry.
9710000	9712000	I, I partook of them too.
9712000	9714000	eBay changed their logo.
9714000	9716000	Yeah, like months ago.
9716000	9720000	Yeah, but I looked at eBay and fuck.
9720000	9721000	All right.
9721000	9723000	And last but not least, Rachel, do you have any FUs you want to get out?
9723000	9727000	Uh, you know, I'd like to say FU to Michael Bay cause you know,
9727000	9729000	you can never FU that guy enough.
9729000	9731000	You know, on eBay, they are.
9731000	9732000	That is a worthy first FU.
9732000	9733000	Good job.
9733000	9734000	Good job.
9734000	9737000	You know, on eBay, they are selling those candy corn Oreos.
9737000	9738000	Fuck eBay.
9738000	9741000	And limited edition, like 15 bucks.
9741000	9746000	Brad from Pod Culture says, Rob Roberts, try the gingerbread Oreos.
9746000	9748000	They have gingerbread Oreos.
9748000	9750000	I need this in my life.
9750000	9751000	Ermahgerd.
9751000	9752000	I need this in my life.
9752000	9755000	Ermahgerd.
9755000	9757000	Let's go to some more stories.
9757000	9758000	I need a cat in my life, Rob.
9758000	9763000	And then you at 1-877-GAME-OLR or Orange Lounge Radio on Skype.
9763000	9764000	Loki.
9765000	9771000	So, the studio that puts out Football Manager 2013 says that, you know,
9771000	9778000	their efforts to stop piracy by adding DRM has actually benefited them.
9778000	9785000	They are saying that, you know, Football Manager 12 was pirated within the first two weeks of its release.
9785000	9789000	However, because, you know, not day one cause of their DRM.
9789000	9798000	They said, though, that the extra sales that they got at the time had helped them have new staff members for this year's release for Football Manager 13.
9798000	9806000	And, you know, had they been pirated day one, they probably wouldn't have the money to have the extra staff.
9806000	9815000	So, yeah, right now, I guess the new game has a new DRM system and as of right now hasn't been cracked.
9815000	9818000	Although, they haven't, I don't know when it came out.
9818000	9825000	And they said that if they can hold on for three or four more weeks, then it'll really benefit retailers and themselves.
9828000	9829000	Is it working?
9829000	9838000	I mean, it's good when it works in the effort to, you know, get people to actually legitimately buy your copies of your games.
9838000	9847000	However, when you have it implemented in a way like Ubisoft does, where it hurts the actual consumers that buy your games and kind of punishes them.
9847000	9851000	Whereas, you know, the person that has the cracked copy has no issues and that's the problem.
9851000	9853000	So, you just kind of have to find that happy medium in there.
9853000	9861000	I kind of think it's interesting how they talk about that like, you know, as long as we can hold off like three weeks before we get cracked, then we'll be good.
9861000	9863000	We'll still sell a lot of copies of the game.
9863000	9869000	I find it interesting that they just kind of give in to the fact that like, yeah, hackers gonna hack, they're gonna get into the game eventually.
9869000	9876000	But, it also, you know, that mentality that the majority, the vast majority of games are in their first week.
9876000	9883000	So, I find it very interesting that it's like, as long as we can hold off to week three, enough people will have bought it by then, whatever, at that point.
9883000	9885000	Very interesting.
9886000	9888000	But, yeah, I also agree with what Loki said.
9888000	9893000	As long as, you know, anti-piracy, you gotta do what you gotta do, but as long as it works.
9894000	9898000	So, alright, moving on to one more story tonight.
9900000	9906000	I can't believe this, but if you're in Finland, you've got some weird taste, that's all I gotta say.
9906000	9908000	No offense, but you guys have some weird taste.
9908000	9910000	Does it say panties?
9910000	9913000	No, well, yes, but it means something different in Finnish.
9913000	9919000	Anyway, she's referring to what is written on the can for Angry Birds Soda.
9919000	9922000	You know, Angry Birds has been licensed for everything.
9922000	9928000	I'm sure there's Angry Birds diapers at this point and whatever, even here in America.
9928000	9933000	But, over in Finland, they have Angry Birds Soda, and here's the crazy thing about it.
9933000	9939000	It's actually outselling Coke and Pepsi in Finland.
9939000	9941000	What?
9942000	9944000	Alright, then.
9944000	9950000	Peter Vesterbakka from Rovio says that the soda will make its way to Australia and New Zealand in the near future.
9950000	9955000	And they say it will probably come to the US eventually as well.
9955000	9960000	So, could Angry Birds someday outsell Coke and Pepsi here in America?
9960000	9962000	I can only hope it's smelt flavored.
9962000	9964000	In Alabama, everything is a Coke.
9964000	9966000	It doesn't matter what drink it is, it's Coke.
9966000	9967000	So, I doubt it.
9967000	9969000	Unless you're in the Midwest, then it becomes pop.
9969000	9970000	Everything's pop.
9970000	9971000	Oh, I hate that.
9971000	9972000	Oh, it's like nails on chalkboard.
9972000	9973000	I hate pop.
9973000	9974000	I hate...
9974000	9975000	Pop is what you do to bubblegum.
9975000	9976000	Not soda.
9976000	9978000	How about soda pop?
9978000	9979000	No!
9979000	9984000	Soda pop was the name of one of the boxers in the original Punch Out.
9984000	9987000	And that's where it stays.
9987000	9995000	It's gonna be weird one of these days when Mario becomes less recognizable to Red Bird.
9995000	9997000	Give the birds fucking names!
9997000	9998000	I mean, seriously.
9998000	9999000	They're just...
9999000	10003000	It's gonna continue a trend of streamlining the shape and the name to the point where
10003000	10007000	it's just gonna be a dot on the screen and it will be because it's, you know, spelling
10007000	10009000	the entire word is tiring.
10009000	10015000	The Skype line is now open at 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is ORANGELOUNGERADIO,
10015000	10017000	all one word.
10017000	10021000	Again, that's 1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, ORANGELOUNGERADIO, all one word.
10021000	10023000	The Skype line is open.
10023000	10024000	And there you go, Nintendo.
10024000	10028000	Nintendo, you could totally rip off Angry Birds by creating Bullet Bills and then having,
10028000	10034000	you know, its own game, you know, where you're just firing Bullet Bills and have them, I
10034000	10037000	don't know, do something.
10037000	10039000	You can combat this.
10039000	10042000	Any last minute stories while we wait for some calls to come in?
10042000	10044000	I'll get to the Twitters in a minute, but...
10044000	10047000	Yeah, actually there was a few things coming out of MineCon because that just happened
10047000	10048000	this weekend.
10048000	10049000	Oh, was that this weekend?
10049000	10050000	Yes, it was.
10050000	10052000	Oh, well hold that thought because we got a call coming in.
10052000	10053000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10053000	10054000	Who's this?
10054000	10060000	Hola, bienvenidos a Orange Launch Radio.
10060000	10062000	I think you're muted.
10062000	10064000	Hello, hello.
10064000	10066000	One more time.
10066000	10068000	Oh, you got to call it.
10068000	10069000	Go one, two, three.
10069000	10070000	All right.
10070000	10071000	Let's try another call.
10071000	10072000	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
10072000	10073000	Who's this?
10073000	10075000	Hey, this is Duke Newcomb.
10075000	10080000	I was wondering what's your guys' favorite Thanksgiving item because I don't think it's
10080000	10082000	been mentioned yet this episode.
10082000	10087000	Duke Newcomb wants to know what is everybody's favorite Thanksgiving item because we haven't
10087000	10089000	mentioned it yet this episode.
10089000	10090000	What a good question.
10090000	10093000	I'm so happy it has absolutely nothing to do with video games, but we like to take a
10093000	10094000	break once in a while.
10094000	10098000	What's more important than video games, Duke Newcomb?
10098000	10099000	Food.
10099000	10100000	Food.
10100000	10101000	That's the answer.
10101000	10102000	What did you say?
10102000	10103000	Never mind.
10103000	10104000	You said what?
10104000	10108000	I said what's more important than video games, Duke Newcomb?
10108000	10109000	Pie.
10109000	10110000	No, the answer is pie.
10110000	10112000	No, the answer is cocks.
10112000	10113000	Yeah.
10113000	10114000	All right.
10114000	10115000	All right.
10115000	10116000	Let's go around and get everybody's...
10116000	10117000	Sorry, my phone is going out.
10117000	10118000	That's all right.
10118000	10119000	That's all right.
10119000	10120000	We'll go around and get everybody's answers here for you.
10120000	10123000	So what is everybody's favorite Thanksgiving item?
10123000	10124000	Dark Sakura.
10124000	10125000	Garrus.
10125000	10126000	Cooked Garrus?
10126000	10127000	No.
10127000	10128000	Oh, cooked?
10128000	10131000	Calibrated to a crisp brown...
10131000	10136000	You know, it has to be actually the chocolate chip pumpkin pie that Becky helped me make.
10136000	10138000	Chocolate chip pumpkin pie.
10138000	10139000	It was epic.
10139000	10140000	All right.
10140000	10141000	All right.
10141000	10142000	Rachel.
10142000	10143000	Turkey skin.
10143000	10144000	Wait, what?
10144000	10145000	Duke Newcomb?
10145000	10149000	Somebody has to claim the bacon-wrapped turkey.
10149000	10151000	Yes, that's right.
10151000	10152000	All right.
10152000	10153000	That's just nasty.
10153000	10154000	Swanson, yes.
10154000	10155000	I'm sorry.
10155000	10158000	And one more time, Rachel, because I got distracted by you.
10158000	10160000	It's turkey skin.
10160000	10161000	Turkey skin.
10161000	10165000	You have to say it like that, because otherwise, what is even the point?
10165000	10166000	All right.
10166000	10167000	Loki.
10167000	10168000	Mashed potatoes.
10168000	10169000	Mashed potatoes.
10169000	10170000	Are we good mashed potatoes?
10170000	10173000	But the Swanson sounds awesome.
10173000	10174000	All right.
10174000	10179000	My answer is the pumpkin mousse dessert that Allen makes.
10179000	10183000	And there might be some in the fridge right now for after the show.
10183000	10184000	Just saying.
10184000	10185000	So there you go.
10185000	10186000	Those are our answers.
10186000	10191000	What's your favorite Thanksgiving food, Duke Newcomb?
10191000	10192000	Yams.
10192000	10194000	Yams and pumpkin pie.
10194000	10195000	I don't know why.
10195000	10202000	It's just like they have this sweet yet sour kind of flavor, the way my grandma makes them.
10202000	10204000	She puts a little bit of lemon juice in there.
10204000	10208000	It's just like this thing that you don't have any other day of the year.
10208000	10209000	And you always look forward to it.
10209000	10213000	Just that one dish is worth the other 364 days.
10213000	10215000	That's a really sweet, sentimental answer.
10215000	10220000	But I can tell that you're an imposter, Duke Newcomb, because the real Duke Newcomb would have said,
10221000	10225000	My favorite Thanksgiving food is kicking ass.
10225000	10226000	No.
10226000	10228000	His favorite Thanksgiving food would be bubble gum.
10228000	10230000	He would be chewing it.
10230000	10233000	The one day of the year he actually gets to chew gum.
10233000	10234000	All right.
10234000	10237000	Any other thoughts for the listeners before I let you go?
10237000	10238000	No.
10238000	10240000	Just happy holidays, you guys.
10240000	10242000	And keep on listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
10242000	10243000	I love this show.
10243000	10245000	We will keep listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
10245000	10246000	You too.
10246000	10249000	I don't listen to this damn thing anybody else in the show says.
10249000	10250000	I'm sorry.
10250000	10251000	What's that?
10251000	10256000	He said the listeners, not the people who are putting it out there, of course.
10256000	10257000	Not you guys.
10257000	10258000	You guys are the hosts.
10258000	10259000	Fine.
10259000	10260000	I'll stop listening.
10260000	10261000	Seriously.
10261000	10262000	Fuck those guys.
10262000	10263000	All right.
10263000	10264000	No.
10264000	10265000	We really appreciate it, Duke Newcomb.
10265000	10266000	Thank you.
10266000	10267000	Thanks for the question and take care.
10267000	10268000	Yeah.
10268000	10269000	Take care.
10269000	10270000	Bye.
10270000	10271000	You know what?
10271000	10272000	It's fun to get a non-gaming question once in a while.
10273000	10276000	It says politicians are the weeds of the galaxy for ten bucks.
10276000	10278000	I want one.
10278000	10279000	1877 game OLR.
10279000	10282000	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10282000	10283000	So, MineCon, Loki.
10283000	10284000	Yes.
10284000	10286000	So, there's a few things from MineCon.
10286000	10291000	First off, there's some details about patch update 1.4 or 1.5.
10291000	10294000	And that's going to be called the Redstone update.
10294000	10296000	It's supposed to be coming out in January.
10296000	10301000	And some of the features they're going to be adding are analog Redstone switches,
10301000	10302000	which is kind of cool.
10302000	10304000	They're going to be doing some tweaks.
10304000	10306000	They're going to have a new capacitor block.
10306000	10310000	Also, they're saying variable signal strength stuff,
10310000	10313000	as well as some additions to the minecarts,
10313000	10316000	ways to link minecarts together.
10316000	10318000	Also, they're saying they're going to have a special block
10318000	10321000	that's going to allow people to dump off cargo.
10321000	10324000	It sounds like a lot of stuff that are kind of inspired by Tekkit,
10324000	10328000	where they're going to have piping systems for you moving stuff to chests
10328000	10330000	and that kind of thing.
10331000	10332000	Pretty cool.
10332000	10337000	And also some new Nether-based ore that I guess will be used to make capacitors.
10337000	10339000	All right, let me hold that thought while we go to the phones.
10339000	10340000	Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio.
10340000	10341000	Who's this?
10343000	10345000	This is the dead call again.
10345000	10346000	I think you're muted.
10346000	10347000	Hello?
10347000	10348000	Hello?
10348000	10350000	Hello?
10350000	10351000	Goodbye.
10351000	10353000	Let's try another one here.
10353000	10354000	Hi, you're on Orange Laundry Radio.
10354000	10355000	Who's this?
10355000	10356000	This is the one and only Ranma.
10356000	10357000	Hey, Ranma.
10357000	10358000	I'm a good runmer.
10358000	10361000	Ermahger Uche.
10361000	10363000	How you doing, Ranma?
10363000	10368000	Alive, awake, stuffed, and full.
10368000	10370000	Full of what?
10370000	10372000	Ermahger Thanksgiving dinner.
10372000	10378000	What's your favorite Thanksgiving meal or Thanksgiving dish?
10378000	10380000	Sweet potato pie.
10380000	10381000	Sweet potatoes.
10381000	10382000	Oh, lovely.
10382000	10383000	Sweet potatoes.
10383000	10386000	Our Friendsgiving had mashed sweet potatoes.
10386000	10387000	Good stuff.
10388000	10390000	So what's on your mind, buddy?
10390000	10391000	Why'd you call?
10391000	10397000	Well, first off, in response to talking about eating Oreos earlier, I can't eat one.
10397000	10399000	It's considered cannibalism.
10399000	10401000	Do not repeat the joke you made in chat.
10401000	10403000	I don't want an explicit tag this week.
10403000	10405000	I'll leave it just like that.
10405000	10407000	All right.
10407000	10410000	I know, this is a PG-13 podcast.
10410000	10411000	Yes, yes, exactly.
10411000	10412000	Well, what else is on your mind?
10412000	10416000	However, I'll allow you to say it if you get me that $65 Garris figure.
10416000	10418000	Don't listen to her.
10418000	10423000	You have to talk to my accountant right now, so yeah.
10423000	10427000	So what's going on in your gaming world, Ranma?
10427000	10430000	Not too much.
10430000	10433000	The only game I've been doing has been on my tablet.
10433000	10437000	And I was checking eBay on Saturday and I'm like, wow.
10437000	10442000	I really kind of feel bad for those people who sit on those long lines to grab a Wii U
10442000	10444000	just to flip it because you know what?
10444000	10446000	That was going to be me.
10446000	10450000	I ain't got pity in the world for those people.
10450000	10457000	Even if you had done it yourself, Ranma, I would have said, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
10457000	10458000	Hey, Ranma.
10458000	10459000	Yes.
10459000	10460000	Ha.
10460000	10467000	Because the most expensive one I saw was $405 with 70 bids.
10467000	10468000	Wow.
10468000	10476000	Well, I mean, it's just either people are resisting or it's not that hard to come by right now.
10476000	10480000	You can still find basics on shelves in some places and some people are just saying,
10480000	10483000	you know what, I'd rather buy a basic than buy from an eBay flipper.
10483000	10484000	I know.
10484000	10492000	And I remember during the whole Wii U sales, they were going as high as $2,500, $3,000.
10492000	10502000	And I saw ads where you would get Wii, all the released games, 5.1 surround sound system, 50 inch LCD TV.
10502000	10507000	I'll dress up as Santa and bring it to your house and deliver it for your kids on Christmas day.
10507000	10510000	Good lord, how much did that go for?
10510000	10513000	Those were going as high as $3,000.
10513000	10516000	That's not a bad deal for all that shit.
10516000	10520000	I expect to see something like that run the holidays for the Wii U.
10520000	10524000	Rama, will you dress up as Santa and come over to my house and give out the presents?
10524000	10529000	Does it come with full release?
10529000	10530000	Wow.
10530000	10537000	Does my visit from Santa come with a happy ending?
10537000	10540000	Rob, that was bad and you should feel bad.
10540000	10542000	I do.
10542000	10543000	It ain't black Santa.
10543000	10548000	It's Mary Kwanzaa, fool.
10548000	10552000	I pity the fool that don't like candles.
10552000	10553000	How's that?
10553000	10554000	Close enough.
10554000	10556000	It's time for me to wear my Mary Kwanzaa bitches shirt again.
10556000	10561000	How about I send you over to Jamie's house on Christmas because that would be hilarious.
10561000	10567000	If you send me to Jamie's house for Christmas, I might not leave because you know she has that Southern cooking I love.
10567000	10569000	You know I can do it too.
10569000	10575000	I will make grits and mashed potatoes.
10575000	10588000	I'm not going to totally advertise this to all the listeners everywhere, but Alan and I have been talking about starting a new Christmas tradition out of the one we started last year.
10588000	10593000	And that is taking our Jewish friends to Asian food on Christmas.
10593000	10594000	That's right, we did that.
10594000	10595000	We did that last year.
10595000	10597000	We went out for pho, didn't we?
10597000	10600000	Yeah, we didn't. So Alan and I want to extend that again this year.
10600000	10601000	I'm down for that.
10601000	10603000	We might try to get some other people to come along this year.
10603000	10604000	We even sort of made a half joke.
10605000	10610000	Two gay men and a Jew walk into a Vietnamese restaurant.
10610000	10613000	It's a new sitcom. Two gay men and a Jew at a Vietnamese restaurant.
10613000	10616000	I don't know the punchline, but there's one in there somewhere.
10616000	10621000	Jumas has been a long-timing tradition in my house for the last seven years.
10621000	10622000	Chris Maquanzica.
10622000	10624000	There you go.
10624000	10625000	There you go.
10625000	10626000	All right, Rama.
10626000	10627000	I was calling it holiday mass.
10627000	10629000	Mary Festivus to you.
10629000	10631000	The rest of us.
10631000	10632000	The rest of us.
10632000	10635000	If there's nothing else, then I'm going to let you go.
10635000	10636000	Works for me.
10636000	10637000	All right, take care, buddy.
10637000	10638000	Later.
10638000	10639000	Bye.
10639000	10641000	I'm telling you guys, the Oreo joke was really bad.
10641000	10643000	All right, that's going to do it for the Skypline.
10643000	10645000	We're running way over three hours tonight, so I'm going to wrap it up.
10645000	10647000	Sorry to those that didn't get through, but if you didn't get through,
10647000	10649000	you should send us an email.
10649000	10652000	Mailbag at orangelaungeradio.com.
10652000	10655000	Or you can always send us a tweet or any of that stuff.
10655000	10657000	I want to let Loki finish up the last minute stories.
10657000	10658000	All right.
10658000	10659000	I've got to get to Twitter topics, too.
10659000	10660000	One last thing.
10660000	10664000	There was another app that was announced called Minecraft Reality.
10664000	10668000	It's an augmented reality app for iOS,
10668000	10671000	and it can display 3D Minecraft images in the real world,
10671000	10673000	and you can walk around them and stuff.
10673000	10676000	It looked pretty cool from the little trailer that they had.
10676000	10678000	You can check that out.
10678000	10681000	It's two bucks to download.
10681000	10683000	All right.
10683000	10685000	I actually have a last minute story because this just finished
10685000	10687000	while we were doing the show tonight.
10687000	10690000	The Kickstarter for the Shadow Gate reboot has ended,
10690000	10692000	and they made it.
10692000	10695000	So the Shadow Gate reimagining is going to be happening.
10695000	10697000	Which one?
10697000	10699000	The one that we talked about.
10699000	10700000	Oh, Shadow Gate. I'm sorry.
10700000	10702000	Shadow Gate, not Shadow Run.
10702000	10703000	How many of those do they have?
10703000	10706000	The old school NES game and Mac game from back in the day,
10706000	10707000	deja vu, et cetera.
10707000	10710000	Not only did they make their $120,000 for the base game,
10710000	10713000	but they made their first stretch goal of $130,000,
10713000	10716000	meaning they're going to expand on the castle
10716000	10720000	and add some rooms and puzzles, 15% more game.
10720000	10722000	So pretty cool.
10722000	10726000	Congratulations to the team there who make Shadow Gate.
10726000	10728000	Let's get to the Twitter topics.
10728000	10730000	I'm really excited about that Shadow Gate reboot, though.
10730000	10733000	Actually, that's only the second Kickstarter I've ever given to.
10733000	10736000	So I've done GamerCon, and I did that one.
10736000	10738000	So we'll see.
10738000	10740000	There's part of me that wants to give to the Molyneux project,
10740000	10743000	but then I'm like, that guy is such a...
10743000	10746000	The advertisement, again, really, really turned me off a little bit.
10746000	10748000	All right.
10748000	10749000	Let's see.
10749000	10753000	Going to some tweets.
10753000	10755000	Twitter.com slash O-L-R.
10755000	10757000	ActDeft wants to remind us the Gold Nunchuck
10757000	10760000	will make its return to Club Nintendo tomorrow.
10760000	10762000	900 points for the Golden Nunchuck,
10762000	10764000	because they need to get rid of them.
10764000	10766000	I really need this in my life, Rob.
10766000	10767000	You don't understand.
10767000	10768000	What, the Golden Nunchuck?
10768000	10769000	No.
10769000	10770000	What?
10770000	10773000	The Garris figure that's...
10773000	10775000	A sex doll.
10775000	10777000	Hm?
10777000	10778000	That's what?
10778000	10779000	A sex doll.
10779000	10780000	No.
10780000	10782000	It's...
10782000	10787000	Someone linked it to me for cheaper.
10787000	10788000	All right.
10788000	10789000	And let's see.
10789000	10793000	Moving on to the next tweet from Tigerclaw.
10793000	10795000	Oh, I did read about this.
10795000	10800000	007 Legends studio Eurocom laid off a big chunk of its staff this week,
10800000	10804000	and he links us to a story I'm trying to bring up right now.
10804000	10808000	The Eurocom studio, which is based in the UK,
10808000	10812000	laid off the majority of its workforce as part of restructuring.
10812000	10814000	The studio has been around since 88.
10814000	10816000	Yeah, they made a lot of games besides just this,
10816000	10817000	but that's...
10817000	10820000	They also did 007 Reloaded and then, of course, Legends,
10820000	10822000	which wasn't very well received, unfortunately.
10822000	10825000	Eurocom director Hugh Binns said that, quote,
10825000	10827000	Eurocom are undertaking a restructuring,
10827000	10830000	which I regret to say has meant we've made the majority of our workforce
10830000	10831000	redundant today.
10831000	10833000	That's the British word for laying off.
10833000	10837000	This includes many very experienced, talented, and highly skilled employees,
10837000	10841000	and we'd like to thank them all for your hard work and efforts.
10841000	10844000	And they say this is because of the decline in the video game market.
10844000	10847000	The studio had to cancel a number of projects.
10847000	10849000	That sucks.
10850000	10853000	And lastly, SSJ100Matt sends us a tweet about,
10853000	10856000	we all know playing games while driving is a terrible idea,
10856000	10859000	but one game is trying to change that.
10860000	10863000	BrightDriver is what it's called.
10863000	10865000	It's an iPhone app called BrightDriver.
10865000	10869000	It's a platform that supports audio games people play in the car
10869000	10873000	to keep their attention from lagging during long rides.
10873000	10876000	It uses GPS functionality to keep track of the user's driving
10876000	10880000	using metrics like speed, break rate, and stressful conditions like traffic,
10880000	10884000	and the games modify their pace appropriately.
10884000	10886000	That is crazy.
10886000	10890000	That's kind of cool, like an audio game that you interact with.
10890000	10892000	I want to hear more about this.
10892000	10894000	I'll have to read the rest of the story for a future week,
10894000	10896000	but that sounds kind of cool.
10896000	10900000	So that's it for the tweets tonight at twitter.com slash O-L-R.
10900000	10904000	And this means we're at the end of the show.
10905000	10908000	Rachel, thank you very much for coming to the show tonight.
10908000	10909000	Thank you for having me.
10909000	10911000	And sitting in. Come back any time.
10911000	10912000	I surely will.
10912000	10914000	And we'll talk to you again.
10914000	10917000	It may have taken you 480 episodes to get here,
10917000	10919000	but it doesn't look like we're going to go anywhere any time soon.
10919000	10921000	Duke Nukem told us we need to keep listening,
10921000	10923000	so I guess we're here for a little while.
10923000	10926000	Do you have any final thoughts for our listeners tonight?
10929000	10930000	Yeah.
10930000	10931000	Yeah.
10931000	10932000	Quick plug?
10932000	10933000	Sure, of course.
10933000	10935000	Greetings from the wasteland at WordPress.
10935000	10939000	I do creepypasta, and I do write about video games occasionally.
10939000	10941000	There you go. Awesome.
10941000	10945000	Um, Loki, any last thoughts, final thoughts from you tonight?
10945000	10948000	I just, I don't know.
10948000	10951000	Hopefully we'll be playing some Black Ops 2 multiplayer this week,
10951000	10953000	aside from just, you know, myself and my coworker.
10953000	10954000	Alrighty.
10954000	10956000	Uh, DarkSagra.
10956000	10959000	Someone really needs to get me the Geras figure.
10959000	10960000	I'm not even kidding.
10960000	10962000	Does it come with full release?
10963000	10966000	Yeah, does it come with Tumblr rendered vajay?
10966000	10967000	Alright.
10967000	10969000	And, uh, my final thought tonight, as always,
10969000	10972000	thank you all for listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
10972000	10975000	If you enjoyed the show, please tell a friend or two or 20 about the show.
10975000	10978000	Help us spread the word, because we don't have any major websites behind us.
10978000	10982000	Or, I mean, we have the VoG network, but let's be real,
10982000	10985000	it's not exactly a 1UP.com or a giant bomb.
10985000	10987000	So, uh, you know, help spread the word.
10987000	10989000	A website that generates revenue.
10989000	10990000	Exactly, exactly.
10990000	10991000	It's a fun project.
10991000	10992000	But you know what?
10992000	10994000	There are more great shows on VoG.
10994000	10995000	It is not just us.
10995000	10997000	There are lots and lots of great shows on VoG.
10997000	11000000	Bobby Black Wolf before us, Sunday nights.
11000000	11003000	Uh, Understation Live on Saturday nights.
11003000	11007000	Mondays are full of Pod Culture, British Invaders, and Critical Myth.
11007000	11010000	Critical Myth, the hardworking guys, they're on three times a week on the network.
11010000	11012000	Anime Jam session on Tuesday.
11012000	11015000	Uh, Girls Gone Wow on Wednesday.
11015000	11017000	And Horde House, they're okay.
11017000	11018000	Also on Wednesday.
11018000	11020000	So, there you go, yes.
11020000	11022000	As Black Wolf says in chat, VoG network.
11022000	11024000	It's a website.
11025000	11026000	That's a good final thought.
11026000	11028000	It's a website.
11028000	11029000	We'll see you next time.
11029000	11031000	On our website.
11031000	11032000	Have a good night, everybody.
11032000	11033000	Bye.
11034000	11037000	You've been listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
11037000	11042000	Orange Lounge Radio is a production of OLR Studios.
