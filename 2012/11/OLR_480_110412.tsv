14138	26825	Tonight, November 4th, 2012, Sony reports a loss of close to $200 million, details emerge on Nintendo Network Premium, and one vice president of a retail gaming company pleads guilty to embezzlement.
32185	36868	Hello my friends out there on the internet and welcome back to another week of the show where every gamer has a voice.
37328	43912	It is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 480 for this November the 4th of 2012.
45493	49055	I hope for those of you guys that go out and do stuff on Halloween, you had a good Halloween.
49855	55259	And I can't believe it, but now is that time of year where we start seeing all the Christmas stuff show up in stores and all that...
57420	61963	and I'm sure wanting to comment on that is the one and only DarkSakura or Jamie Summers.
62063	66186	I still haven't seen any Hanukkah stuff and Hanukkah is like two weeks before Christmas.
67547	68667	It's just, it's not fair.
70208	72250	I think that it's, it's...
74937	77079	Bigotry, it's bigotry, it's prejudice.
77119	82823	To be fair, I haven't seen any Festivus polls, so they're hating on Festivus too.
84404	84985	Oh my god.
86366	90989	I just saw a funny thing in chat, so I'm not going to say it because I'm not talking about politics.
91309	91709	All right.
92149	92809	Thank gosh.
92849	93130	All right.
93710	95650	Also say hello to Tech Master Loki.
95910	96210	Hi.
96310	97011	How are you, Loki?
97131	97551	I'm fine.
98251	98751	Excellent.
99231	99951	What's new with you?
99971	101512	How was your week?
102132	103172	It's been all right.
103352	104313	Lots of Minecraft.
104553	105213	Lots of Minecraft.
105233	111115	You were showing me... Okay, tell me about this little thing you were... This was cool, this map thing you were showing me before the show.
111415	112115	How does that work?
112455	113116	Dynamic Map or Dynemap
140336	159257	and basically it's almost in real time there's a little bit of there's some glitches like I've noticed a few blocks not updating but it's pretty much in real time and it shows just everything that's on the server you can take a peek and see what people are building and just kind of how things look
160543	163886	Maybe get you interested in joining up on the server because it's fun.
165046	165947	So we've got that.
166187	167849	But yeah, check it out.
168369	171912	You can even see when people are playing, you can see them moving around and where they're at and stuff like that.
172652	173193	You can watch chat.
173253	174994	So it's kind of fun.
175427	191612	that's kind of neat that you can do that all live and I like being able to see kind of the like just isometric view and I even found my house on there you helped but I was able to find the house and all that yeah I haven't gotten around to labeling everything yet like some people's places I don't know who built them you know I know I was like Loki what's that
191792	192152	I don't know.
192232	192972	Loki, what's that?
193132	194573	I don't know.
194753	195533	I've seen that there.
195573	196213	I just don't remember.
196514	212839	And there was one time I did see who built it, but I don't remember who it was because they were standing there idling and I just didn't remember because some people are not responsible enough to label their houses with signs so I know who's building what.
213099	215840	Your roller coaster is epic too, by the way.
215860	216300	It's pretty large.
216320	216880	I haven't ridden it yet.
216920	218541	I'm still not going to play it until someone buys it for me.
220382	226007	What she's not going to tell you is that when she saw the map and was looking at everything, she was like, okay, maybe I do need to play this.
227748	230030	She's starting to turn around a little bit.
230070	231311	Loki's magic is working a little bit.
231391	232732	I'm going to put my foot down.
232772	234393	When someone buys it for me, then I'll play it.
235134	237096	Maybe Hanukkah Harry will bring you a copy.
238777	239698	I'd rather have the N7 hoodie
252885	253646	What stopped you from going?
253686	255247	You see all the big new movies.
255687	256768	No, I don't, actually.
256888	257728	You usually do.
257988	260070	I used to before I had a kid.
260730	262971	Oh, well, this is a kid's movie, sort of.
263111	265553	Well, I just didn't get a chance to go see it.
265613	269815	I mean, I still want to see it, but it's just I haven't gotten to go see it yet.
270046	270486	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
295182	298724	I want to note, even though it looked like a Pixar movie, it was not a Pixar movie.
298884	309409	So it did not beat all the Pixar movies, but it did beat all of the Disney classics, which includes Tangled, which was also kind of that same animation style, if you saw that movie.
309469	311951	But it made $49.1 million, at least that's the estimate.
312251	314292	Now, the interesting thing is they are crediting...
314992	344438	Hurricane Sandy for some of the reason why it did so well because a lot of kids didn't have school on Friday a lot of people wanted to just get away you know out of the nightmare they've been living the past week and go see a movie so they're actually saying it was part of the reason it had a little bit of a boost but I don't know I mean I just know a lot of people that I know were really interested in seeing this movie and it really did seem like the type of thing that was geared at families as well as you know
344938	346339	It had the classic stuff.
347279	348480	The classic stuff was great.
348620	350041	The references, if you caught them.
350962	351742	I have to go see it again.
352983	354864	I'm going to try to phrase this without spoiling it.
354924	356545	I saw it too and I had a great time.
356825	363449	And I think the great thing about it is that, well, obviously I like two things and we talk about it a lot on this show.
363529	364830	Video games and Disney.
365330	366671	And this movie was really both.
367331	373575	But the neat thing about it is that it wasn't really about the video games.
375086	376507	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
396983	422741	so I kind of think it was neat that it was this very traditional Disney story and for all practical purposes it was pretty formulaic for the rest of Disney movies not that that's a bad thing but you know it was it was it was kind of what you'd expect from a Disney movie but it took place in this universe that coexists alongside Street Fighter, Q-Bert, you know Sega games all these other things what did you think about them going to the Tapper?
423723	424603	Oh, I thought that was great.
424643	427444	Yeah, there was a scene where- I thought about you when I saw that.
427745	428785	Where they referenced Tapper.
429005	431686	And one of my friends sitting next to me was like, is Tapper a real game?
431766	433867	I'm like, oh my God, how old are you?
434107	435968	I'm like, I'm way older than you.
436068	437989	I remember Tapper when it was in the arcades.
438649	442970	Dan completely jumped at the, and I'm not going to say any more than this, the Road Blasters.
443331	444151	Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
444793	446674	A, Stay Till the Very, Very, Very End of the Credits
468380	470381	for a little, you know, like most movies.
470621	474682	It's not a big thing, but it's one of those things that when you see it, you'll be like, oh, that's clever.
474782	475242	That's funny.
475522	475802	LOL.
476763	481304	And then also, crap, what else was I going to say?
481884	482144	I don't know.
482164	482644	The graffiti.
482985	483645	Oh, yeah, the graffiti.
483865	485045	Keep an eye out for the various graffiti.
485065	487646	There's so many little jokes on the side.
488246	494268	And actually, you can see Princess Peach and Princess Toadstool are like totally in the movie, but they're like in the background.
495189	495690	But it's them.
495770	496431	It's totally them.
496471	501458	Well, there was the one scene with Chun-Li walking with the two princesses, but neither of them were...
503186	503686	Peach or Toadstool.
503766	504766	I think one of them was Peach.
504826	506047	One of them was in blue.
506067	507127	I think one was Daisy.
507387	508187	Oh, probably Pauline.
508667	508847	Yeah.
509428	509888	And Pauline.
510388	512048	So, very interesting.
512568	513509	Let's go to our chat room.
513829	518050	I'm being a very bad boy and I did not introduce our chat yet, but we do love our live chatters.
518110	519250	We love the podcast listeners.
519270	525632	We also love the people that join us live every Sunday night at the Voice of Geeks Network or vognetwork.com.
525932	531053	We do tape live every Sunday night at 6 Pacific and 9 o'clock Eastern right after the Bobby Blackwolf show.
532073	539838	and we have a live chat room that you can chat along with us at live.vognetwork.com and GameGuru in chat says it was Daisy and Rosalina.
539918	540698	That's the name.
540718	541519	I couldn't think of her name.
541959	542659	It was Rosalina.
542759	543580	From Galaxy.
544480	545501	Pauline was Donkey Kong.
545621	549864	Yeah, Pauline was Donkey Kong but I thought they retroactively made her a princess or something.
549904	551424	I don't think so.
551444	552305	She was wearing pink.
552625	556527	It's like the same thing where everybody's like, oh, Leia's a Disney princess now.
556627	557568	Leia's a Disney princess.
558048	559109	I just think that that's funny.
559369	559849	Hold on.
560150	561411	Put the brakes on that chat.
561451	562392	We'll get there in a minute.
563593	565595	But meanwhile, let's see.
565675	568717	Dan Shadow in our chat room says, I hate end credits crap.
569718	570960	I hate end credits crap.
571160	572381	Do you hate end credits crap?
572981	573262	I don't know.
573282	573822	I love it.
575063	577565	I actually make a habit of saying through the credits regardless.
578376	589427	because I think that a lot of people behind the scenes put a lot of hard work in the movie and that's sort of my nod to them and I hear good music I check the soundtrack listings I downloaded the soundtrack in the theater
592453	615348	I had a roommate in college that was very much like you where it was like whenever we would go to see the movies he's like nope we're not leaving till after the credits is over and it was nothing about bonus scenes or anything like that it was just no we're gonna watch the entire movie and I was like all right I guess everybody's got their thing you don't want it you don't want to get the jump on getting out of here get the parking lot all right all right we'll stay and watch credits it's fine so I think that's that's fine though
616408	620150	Let's see, what else did I... Let's see, some people talking about The Wizard.
620731	625573	Ragenator says, so Wreck-It Ralph was about as much about video games as The Wizard was then?
626514	628535	In a funny way, yes.
629496	639861	Like, I kind of don't like acknowledging that that reference works because The Wizard was a very different type of movie and for all practical purposes, let's be real, it wasn't a very good movie.
641002	648988	We just... We remember it being awesome because we were kids and it had that look at Super Mario 3 and, you know, the Power Glove.
649048	649769	It's so bad.
649809	652591	And all that, like, commercial shit that's, like, you know, shoved down your throat.
653212	654293	Wreck-It Ralph didn't really have that.
654333	656735	Like, Wreck-It Ralph wasn't... The Wii, it wiggles.
656815	657055	Yeah.
657455	660476	Now, I did see a Wii U commercial in the theater before the movie.
660496	662037	That's the only time I've seen a Wii U commercial.
662357	663557	They only have one.
663757	667519	Somebody was asking on Twitter today, like, why are there not Wii U commercials on TV and all this stuff?
667539	668819	I'm like, I saw one in the movie theater.
669720	672001	Putting it before Wreck-It Ralph seems like a nice place to do it.
672021	672541	You know what?
672581	682305	They did this thing for Cartoon Network live TV shows, and my husband was like, I miss that commercial that ran for five years with What's-Her-Face.
682985	683425	What was it?
683585	685246	The Closer or something?
685686	685926	Mm-hmm.
686946	716166	but then they showed the Ultimate Geek trailer because you know how lately I don't know if every theater in America does this but at least all the ones around here do they have that thing called the Fathom Events where it's like the Metropolitan Night at the Opera or I think Riff Trax does their stuff through Fathom Events but here's the big thing they're doing at the end of November they're doing two episodes of Star Trek The Next Generation in HD people cheered and everybody in the theater cheered and we're like because it's geeks show us when it's DS9 bitches
719207	721449	But just for the record, I still want to go to that.
721629	722109	Just saying.
722229	726532	We need to make plans November 29th because I love Star Trek The Next Generation.
727213	728053	All right.
728734	728994	Let's see.
730154	731655	What else did I want to say about the movie?
731735	732076	I don't know.
732556	734557	I liked it quite a bit.
734737	742642	Again, it's not like shoving the video games in your face, but I'm really glad that this part of pop culture is just –
743823	747464	It's there and it's being acknowledged without it being niche.
747884	754545	And it's really cool now that I think there's a lot of parents out there who remember a lot of these games from when they were younger.
755205	757706	And now we need a TV series, right?
758566	761387	Well, it will be interesting to see if the movie continues to do well.
761487	764527	I heard it had a very large budget, so it has a lot of money to make up.
764968	771469	But if the movie does well, which if it's had a bigger opening than Tangled and there's really not a lot of competition for the movie coming until Thanksgiving...
772189	773670	There's still another Tron movie.
799670	800113	Let's hope.
800496	800919	Let's hope.
800999	801442	I hope.
801624	802530	I don't doubt the other will do.
802827	803868	Star Wars Episode VII Fanboy Reaction
832816	837939	Lucas turned around and donated the money to education He's probably just ready to retire He's keeping his Marin properties
859031	871477	So the game developing building and his ranch, the Skywalker Ranch, is staying under his property, including everything that's on it, but the company itself.
872038	877801	Because he wanted to build a movie theater in Marin County, and all the people with their nose in the air said, Yeah, I want a movie theater.
878061	878682	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
896585	899606	How will it possibly be worse than the prequels?
899746	903788	I don't care if it is Mickey and Goofy, which it won't be.
903868	904648	We all know it won't be.
904748	906829	How can it possibly be worse than the prequels?
907029	909510	There was a statement, too, that it's changing the canon from the books.
910190	913731	Well, I seem to remember... Who reads books nowadays?
914172	916132	There are a lot of people that are into those damn Star Wars books.
916212	925256	I realize that people want those Star Wars books to be adapted, but I seem to recall around the time the prequels came out, there were many interviews with George Lucas where he said...
925856	930537	When he did the first trilogy, he always planned for there to be three trilogies.
931018	935699	And the recurring characters that would be in all nine movies would be C-3PO and R2-D2.
935999	941301	And there would be a trilogy before the original trilogy, and there would be a trilogy after the original trilogy.
941901	946042	And he always said that it was going to be nine movies.
946122	949023	But then when he was making the prequels, he was like, you know what?
949103	950984	I don't think there's going to be anything else after this.
951784	952905	Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher last year about this.
970353	973454	They're way too old to reprise the roles unless it's like way set in the future.
973634	981417	Well, or like they said that Luke Skywalker could be the Obi-Wan Kenobi type of the new movies.
981437	982398	And that would make a lot of sense.
982798	986879	But the reoccurring characters would be C-3PO and R2-D2 because they're androids.
986899	987740	They don't die.
988240	989160	And that makes a lot of sense.
991301	993102	But I'm curious enough.
993742	996103	Anyhow, sorry, I didn't mean to get on a movie tangent, but...
996443	1008928	Well, no, but the big thing is that if they're gonna... I mean, for them to realistically have those people play the same characters, they're gonna have to change the book canon anyway.
1009489	1014351	Which, honestly, the book canon was going way too crazy and I couldn't even deal with it, so...
1015571	1041969	Ragenator says how can it be worse this is how episode 7 can be centered around Jar Jar it can't 7 will be after the original trilogy Jar Jar will be dead in fact I want to point this out if you think that Disney's gonna fuck up Star Wars you need to go ride the new Star Tours ride because the best ending on that's because you know the Star Wars ride has the multiple endings the best ending is the one where they go to Jar Jar's planet because somebody somebody shoots him
1043223	1046144	Disney shot Jar Jar and you all are pissed?
1047064	1047644	By the way, Rob.
1047744	1049445	Your nerd logic doesn't make sense.
1049565	1050045	Let it go.
1050185	1051605	By the way, I finally got Hoth.
1052386	1052746	Oh, did you?
1052846	1053526	It was awesome.
1053546	1054446	Yeah, it is awesome.
1054606	1055526	The ice planet's the best.
1056447	1058127	Anyhow, let's see.
1060228	1064509	YYR says, Star Wars Episode 7 begins with the assassination of Jar Jar Binks.
1064569	1065109	You're welcome.
1066549	1067570	No, he won't be in it at all.
1067590	1068750	They're just going to look past it.
1069290	1071711	Maybe Gungan lived for hundreds of years.
1072171	1087288	SSJ100 Matt says just please don't have JJ Abrams direct the next three that would be weird because that's like the crossing the streams thing you don't cross Trek and Wars like I've seen a lot of people campaigning for Zachary Quinto to be a villain in Star Wars
1088209	1088629	He can't.
1088689	1089630	He's locked into Trek.
1089690	1092071	And I just, I think there is this nerd thing.
1092111	1093671	You don't cross Trek in Wars.
1093811	1094432	You can't do it.
1094512	1099414	However, it is completely hilarious to sing Star Trek in line for Star Wars.
1099954	1100474	Just saying.
1101214	1103235	Especially when you get the cast member singing along with you.
1104476	1104916	Let's see.
1105436	1108637	TheRobD says, Han and Leia's kids have a complete story.
1108717	1109278	Seriously.
1109378	1112339	The books go so far into the future that the story of their kids has been told.
1112939	1114259	I think it would make a lot of sense.
1114420	1115460	I swear we'll get to games.
1115580	1116641	Luke Skywalker, Han and Leia's kids
1131795	1133096	That doesn't mean it has to be on the books.
1133116	1134517	The books are not being turned into movies.
1134537	1136077	As long as Mara Jade is in it, I'm happy.
1136338	1137919	The books will not be turned into movies.
1138239	1138619	Period.
1138679	1139579	Mara Jade needs to be in it.
1140620	1141340	You're stretching it.
1141461	1148645	That may happen only because they ended up calling one of the planets Coruscant in the prequels because that came from the books.
1150125	1152627	Yeah, but they also referenced it in, I think, the first one.
1153684	1157368	Anyway, Tiger Claw says, how about Joss Whedon directing Star Wars?
1157768	1158389	I could go with that.
1158969	1164214	I think while that would make a lot of nerds happy, why don't you give him the time to do all this stuff with the Avengers?
1164354	1165135	Like, he's one guy.
1166036	1168098	He can't do everything nerd.
1169139	1169419	I would...
1170936	1173697	I'd like to see some of these, oh God, I'm going to get so much.
1173717	1174797	I want to see Kashyyyk in it.
1175137	1183860	I'm going to get so much shit for this, but I think it would be really cool to get somebody like one of the Harry Potter directors that made the really, like.
1183880	1186861	I'm looking forward to Tim Burton's adaptation of Star Trek.
1186921	1187462	No, no, no, no, no.
1187562	1189302	Alfonso Cuaron, who did the third.
1191243	1195824	Guillermo del Toro, although he didn't do a Harry Potter movie, but he's, you know, Pan's Labyrinth and all the stuff he does.
1196305	1197625	Directed by Francis Ford Cooper.
1198130	1198230	Gloom.
1224025	1224305	Maniac Mansion
1240925	1247870	They'll probably continue to contract with other developers to do Star Wars on the consoles.
1248050	1251773	Now, if we're talking like Tim Burton, that is a movie that Tim Burton would be perfect doing.
1252333	1253114	Maniac Mansion.
1253414	1254435	Oh, that would be awesome.
1255575	1256756	Oh, good points in our chat room.
1256796	1258337	Dan Shadow says ILM.
1258537	1259298	That's very true.
1259598	1261399	Tiger Claw says Skywalker Sound.
1261780	1263061	So Disney picks up all that.
1263101	1263621	That's great.
1263981	1267424	And again, I'm just going to say, how can it get any worse than...
1269565	1270327	Star Wars Connect Game
1278752	1280093	Have you played that Star Wars Connect game?
1280233	1282874	No, because I'm smart enough to know that it's terrible.
1282994	1284194	I just want to remind you.
1284414	1285355	Be quiet, advertisement.
1285655	1293578	I just want to remind you of a little sequence that's in the Star Wars Connect game, and that is the dance battle to I'm Han Solo.
1293978	1296339	Let me play a little clip of that.
1296499	1298020	All of the songs are equally terrible.
1298060	1300801	Just to remind you how bad things can be.
1302021	1303142	Just want to remind you of that here.
1309113	1310437	Have you seen this before, DarkSakura?
1310938	1312242	This is the Star Wars Connect game.
1323089	1324971	And that's going to get worse under Disney?
1326093	1327274	It can't get worse.
1327835	1328676	Famous last words.
1329057	1330318	It can't get worse.
1330438	1330639	What?
1341314	1348558	Alright, Ragenator says, just wait, Disney will buy the rights to Rocky Horror Picture Show next and then they'll blend Star Wars and Rocky Horror Picture Show and Sky would probably squeak.
1348598	1351500	No, that wouldn't happen because that would involve buying 20th Century Fox.
1351920	1355162	And I think there's laws set up for that big of an acquisition.
1355182	1359825	That means we can have meetings in space.
1359865	1360165	Let's see.
1360485	1364267	Ranma says, so how long before Disney makes Marvel a former shell of itself?
1364748	1364848	Oh!
1366616	1370539	Oh yeah, Disney really fucked up Marvel with that Avengers movie.
1370839	1372260	Oh yeah, that was terrible.
1372320	1374161	Oh, and Disney really fucked the Muppets over.
1374501	1377523	Yeah, that new Muppets movie was really bad compared to the last couple.
1380865	1381606	Dot, dot, dot.
1384788	1385188	Is your mic off?
1385208	1386209	Yeah, my mic was off, sorry.
1386669	1388250	Now they just need to buy the Mega Man franchise.
1389831	1391232	Yes, yes to that.
1391652	1392453	And Blizzard.
1393635	1394857	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1413719	1416444	Disney still has licensing rights to Indiana Jones.
1416804	1420750	How else are they going to have the ride, for one thing?
1421131	1424456	How else are they going to have all of the merchandise that they sell at Disneyland?
1424597	1426540	And on top of that, they have the pinball table.
1427472	1434097	This is how Indiana Jones... Indiana Jones will come again, but it's going to be in about 10 to 15 years.
1435458	1440542	Indiana Jones is what Disney will do after the trilogy is done, and that's going to be a good 10 years away.
1440823	1445406	They're going to do Indiana Jones next, and it will be the good old-fashioned Hollywood fix-it reboot.
1445526	1446267	Just wait for it.
1446447	1447788	We do not want a Shia LaBeouf.
1448469	1448929	Reboot.
1449329	1450290	I want a good actor.
1450931	1451731	Just saying, good actor.
1451751	1453353	A reboot could put a good actor in the role.
1453713	1454113	Just saying.
1455394	1455634	Anyhow.
1455714	1457955	But as long... It needs to be done after we're all dead.
1458195	1458435	All right.
1459015	1460695	Too much movies, not enough games.
1460796	1462276	Let's talk about video games again.
1462556	1466617	We always like to start off the show, you know, 30 minutes into it, with how was your gaming week?
1466877	1468918	Let's talk about the video games that you've been playing this week.
1468958	1469938	DarkSakura, we'll start with you.
1470798	1475219	Well, you know, I actually didn't get to play much because I started a job.
1475939	1476600	I have a job now.
1476940	1477320	Congrats.
1477640	1478060	Thank you.
1478500	1478660	And I...
1483928	1489751	I downloaded a demo for a game that I'm going to talk about in Part B. I never got a chance to play it because I've been working.
1490431	1495253	But I've been playing a bunch of Mass Effect 2 because I beat Mass Effect 1 earlier.
1495273	1497134	I finally did everything in the first Mass Effect.
1497394	1501596	So it wasn't that you played the demo because you didn't play the demo because you were working.
1501636	1503957	You didn't play the demo because you were playing Mass Effect 2.
1504057	1504757	Let's be real.
1506808	1507389	It's okay.
1507549	1510330	And I logged into WoW long enough so I wouldn't get booted from the guild.
1511951	1516313	I haven't touched WoW more than long enough to say hi to people since.
1517653	1520775	And for the record, I still can't get in my Mass Effect 3, just saying.
1521575	1522315	That's still a thing?
1522796	1523276	Yeah.
1523476	1525517	I watched that mod ending.
1527855	1529356	It was terrible.
1529656	1535079	Yeah, somebody actually made a mod that will change the ending to the happy ending.
1535119	1537921	They call it the Mass Effect 3 happy ending.
1537941	1539762	The clipping issues, though.
1539822	1547106	Well, the thing that cracked me the fuck up is that they inserted video footage, obviously, from other places in the game, but some of them had an IGN watermark.
1547426	1548107	And I was like...
1548948	1549208	Really?
1549649	1550270	Yes, really.
1550470	1551993	No, I mean, that was what I was thinking.
1552053	1552274	Really?
1552634	1553416	Really, yeah.
1553556	1557503	And on top of that, most of the footage of the space battle thing is from the low E...
1560949	1561930	Preparedness thing.
1563450	1563831	Whatever.
1564131	1565451	Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
1565471	1566372	The universe rating.
1566412	1572155	Because I've watched all the different versions of the endings to see what affected what.
1572815	1577477	And yeah, that's from the super low I did shit where the Normandy explodes and everyone dies ending.
1578198	1578858	I was like, really?
1578878	1579918	This must be a happy ending, huh?
1581719	1581999	It was...
1584085	1587707	Interesting to see it pulled off, but I'm not ready to install it.
1587807	1589908	I like my Destroy ending.
1590448	1591429	That's canon in my head.
1592689	1600733	It's very impressive to me that people can mod the ending and that that's a thing now, to mod the ending to make it the way you want.
1601033	1606356	And I'm just like, oh my god, the new trilogy can't get here fast enough, so people have something new to bitch about.
1606957	1619366	Well, the whole thing is that in theory I know how it can be done because really it would be changing code to insert sequence for pre-rendered stuff and screens for all of the little flashback-y things.
1620727	1627812	And then it would actually be taking pre-existing animations and loading different textures over them.
1629337	1638103	Which, by the way, that picture of Jacob's face over Garrus' body is absolutely hilarious because he has his mouth expanded like it was for the whole Garrus face.
1638755	1639336	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1662318	1684653	well yeah I saw that one mod or whatever that Loki was talking about a couple weeks ago on the show that changed all the characters to other gaming franchise characters but that was it yeah this is just like you have a different frame for the animation which in Mass Effect is actually a lot easier because they all use a human skeleton but not so much in Smash Brothers so anyway
1685107	1688711	TheRobD in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, I'm over Mass Effect 3.
1688891	1692635	There's too much else to enjoy to continue bitching about Mass Effect 3.
1693076	1693797	Ain't that the truth?
1694037	1697300	And multiplayer is really great in Mass Effect 3.
1697441	1698261	If it works!
1698602	1700884	Well, on Xbox it's been great.
1702426	1702886	Alright, anyhow.
1703447	1704328	Loki, how was your gaming week?
1705291	1706613	It's basically Minecraft.
1706633	1708895	I mean, that's what I've been doing most of the week.
1708915	1716023	I finally got the option to switch the server over to a bucket server, which is a server that allows mods.
1716163	1717205	So that's what I did.
1717365	1719367	I have it running on a bucket server now.
1719427	1725294	So aside from the Dynamap thing that I talked about before...
1726414	1735717	We also have now WorldEdit, which is kind of cool for making structures and stuff really fast and also for leveling mountains and that kind of fun stuff.
1736077	1736557	So we have that.
1736877	1742999	And Mob Arena, which I'm setting up right now, a PvE arena where you can fight.
1743619	1745200	Waves and Waves of Monsters
1767618	1784906	so we've got a lot of work to do on that and then I'll play a little bit of Call of Duty this week and hopefully I'll be playing Black Ops 2 in a couple weeks here and that's pretty much it I think I haven't really played a whole ton this week
1785834	1786994	Yeah, I'm kind of in the same boat as you.
1787034	1788235	I haven't played a whole ton this week.
1788995	1793277	More World of Warcraft, which I'll talk about on Horde House, the other show, a little later this week.
1793337	1797058	But a little preview, a follow-up for those of you that do listen to Horde House.
1797558	1800059	Our guild did take down the first raid boss, finally.
1800139	1800719	Yay!
1800779	1801539	Puppies are dead.
1801599	1804440	And the trick was, use three healers instead of two.
1804780	1807261	The minute we ran it with three healers, we had it down in three pulls.
1807861	1809722	As opposed to, like, the 20 before that.
1809842	1810962	So, that was the trick.
1811703	1811803	Um...
1812723	1832320	and then I did play some Mass Effect 3 multiplayer not to make this a Mass Effect show but they did have the Halloween challenge which I thought was really cute because they modded the game to make like the little beacons turned into pumpkins and the little devices that you did the upload from were all little pumpkins and you know they did that and then you had these certain little mini achievements that you get the new banner
1832680	1837122	Which I thought that was a pretty hefty reward because it's really hard and you have to play a lot to get a lot of those banners.
1837423	1839023	But the Halloween challenge unlocks a banner.
1839083	1841705	So I was like, oh, I want to get a banner for no particular reason.
1841765	1842805	My EP needs it.
1843266	1843906	So I did that.
1844166	1846267	So yeah, that was the Halloween challenge.
1847788	1849349	Screw that Vanguard challenge, though.
1849489	1853331	I'm not doing that one because I don't really like Vanguards as much as all my friends seem to.
1854711	1855792	Ooh, this is the next, next iPad.
1876658	1877358	Yeah, yeah.
1877799	1882942	I'm too addicted to the Wheel of Fortune, and it's the quiz game.
1882982	1884103	It's that damn quiz game.
1884123	1888265	I don't know if every Dave & Buster's has it, but it's like the giant quiz machine with the three buttons.
1889005	1890706	We just sit there and play that for like an hour.
1891027	1895769	Just keep putting the tickets in or swiping the card and getting tickets.
1895789	1895910	No DDR?
1897010	1899692	Um, I don't believe they have a DDR machine anymore.
1900272	1901313	Well, Dave and Buster's never did.
1901353	1905676	They always only had Pump It Up, but they replaced it with a giant Connect 4 machine.
1906096	1909659	It's like, oh my, the thing is so bright, you can see it from space.
1909979	1910559	It's crazy.
1911180	1913641	So, it's just Connect 4, whatever.
1914662	1916183	I think the one by us has an X2.
1916343	1917964	Do they?
1918364	1918785	Yeah.
1919265	1921126	They don't have Pump, I don't think.
1921607	1921947	Interesting.
1922403	1923284	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1945267	1946728	Thanks for watching!
1975267	1975547	DarkSakura.com
1995813	1997614	Master Chief wakes up after a long time.
1997634	2003197	I mean, that's pretty much kind of... Well, a lot of it depends on what friends of mine are going to be playing Halo 4.
2003317	2006799	Because Halo 2 was the best because I played it with my college buddies.
2007720	2009741	And this was a little bit after college when that game first came out.
2009781	2012403	And we would have our night that we would all play Halo 2.
2012783	2014544	And it was just us, no strangers.
2014564	2015364	And we had a great time.
2015665	2017886	When I went to Halo 3, that kind of fell apart.
2018186	2019827	And so it was mostly strangers in Halo 3.
2020067	2020668	And I was kind of like...
2024310	2028172	Having my ass handed to me by strangers isn't as much fun as when it's people you know.
2028292	2035777	Yeah, Bonds006 in our chatroom says, I just did Halo 1, 2, and 3.
2036157	2037819	Never did the ODST in Wars.
2037979	2039560	Yeah, I'm in the same boat, buddy.
2040721	2042843	Ragenator asks kind of a random question.
2042863	2045826	I'll answer this and then we'll go into housekeeping and news.
2046827	2051091	Ragenator asks, Rob, say, have you ever used the games for Windows Marketplace before?
2051571	2057177	I ask because I'm wondering if you can use MS Points on there or do you actually have to use actual dollars and cents?
2058117	2085898	maybe one of the other listeners can correct me I believe it's all dollars and cents on the marketplace I don't think they use the points the only games for Windows I did download it to get that free game Tinker or whatever it was that was in there and when I was really into Game Room you had to have games for Windows for the games that you bought that played on both platforms but that's really about my extent of knowledge of Game for Windows Live so I don't know how the points work there
2086438	2090241	I think Microsoft across the board is moving to regular currency.
2090782	2096126	I don't think you see the Microsoft points in the Windows 8 marketplace, for instance.
2096466	2099048	So I think Microsoft's transitioning away from that.
2101310	2105293	Although Bonds006 says, I have used the games for Windows and they will use your MS points.
2105494	2106474	So maybe I'm wrong.
2106694	2108436	I thought they were transitioning away from that, though.
2108796	2109757	So maybe it's one of those...
2111278	2112199	Do it while you can.
2113119	2119264	I'm sure, though, that if they do decide someday to just get rid of Microsoft Points, you can convert them somehow.
2119324	2120644	It's $80 to a dollar.
2120725	2121245	Exactly.
2121385	2122486	It won't be that difficult.
2122666	2123727	So I wouldn't worry too much about it.
2125148	2125388	Okay.
2127449	2129631	Quick housekeeping and then we'll get into tonight's news.
2130131	2134094	So we were going to have an interview tonight with Eddie from Bomani Style.
2134314	2135675	He needed to postpone that.
2135835	2139278	So if you did not see the message on Twitter, that interview will not be happening tonight.
2139378	2141259	I apologize if you were tuning in just for that.
2141619	2143081	I hope you'll enjoy the show anyway.
2143421	2144542	We are going to reschedule that.
2144622	2146083	I think we're doing it next week.
2146703	2148304	Keep an eye on our Twitter for updates.
2148424	2150106	I will post as soon as I have that confirmed.
2150366	2152588	Twitter.com slash OLR.
2152828	2153909	Real life things happen.
2153969	2155750	So Eddie had to do something else tonight.
2156150	2160753	The other housekeeping thing I want to mention.
2161494	2170440	As we mentioned in Part B last week, Orange Lounge Radio was nominated at the Podcast Awards, www.podcastawards.com, for Best Gaming Podcast.
2171021	2175164	And we're going to try really hard not to spam this like crazy.

2197920	2198820	What's this little award?
2198980	2208187	Oh, oh, we have money elsewhere Oh, we don't need it So they don't even bother promoting it But, you know, the indies are really trying to get the vote And that's a really good sign that one of them will win

2280621	2282062	Let's get into some gaming news.
2282462	2283222	Loki, start us off.
2283943	2288585	Alright, so let's talk a little bit about 38 Studios.
2288625	2291867	I know everyone's familiar with the whole debacle with...
2292727	2295028	Kingdoms of Amalur, Reckoning, and all that stuff.
2295288	2305490	Well, now, apparently, the people that were behind the whole $75 million loan, 438 Studios, are being sued by Rhode Island.
2308010	2309331	And it's kind of interesting.
2309451	2312971	So they're actually going after... What was it?
2313172	2313692	It was...
2315792	2334266	Kurt Schilling, and CEO Jennifer McLean, and I guess also the former Economic Development Corporation Director Keith Stokes and Wells Fargo Securities and Barclays Capital.
2335527	2336888	Barclays just owned the company I worked for.
2338234	2346357	I know you work hard for your paychecks, and for your tax dollars to be squandered is unacceptable.
2346717	2353119	The board's legal action was taken to rectify this grave injustice put upon the people of Rhode Island.
2354980	2357661	So they're going after them for money, and...
2360393	2360713	I don't know.
2360833	2361633	Hopefully they get it.
2362774	2364554	It would be interesting.
2364794	2370236	They're just trying to recoup any losses that they had because they're out $75 million right now.
2370356	2377078	I'm not going to pretend to know the first thing about investment or how the money worked out in this whole mess.
2377498	2384660	So I am not going to be one of those pundits that's like, yeah, take them through the ringer, get them through all their worth or the other extreme.
2384880	2386221	Because I really just don't know.
2387221	2393305	I just find this shit fascinating that the state of Rhode Island is out this money.
2393686	2396448	It's not some private company.
2396948	2402752	The state is out a large amount of money because of the failure of a video game company.
2403172	2406314	That just kind of blows my mind in a way.
2406694	2413399	It's really unfortunate because it would probably make people hesitant to invest in other video game companies, but I don't know.
2413459	2416361	It just blows my mind.
2417802	2420884	TheRobD in chat says, Kurt Schilling will need to sell everything.
2421104	2423526	I feel bad for everyone involved.
2424206	2425907	And Actdeft follows that up with, yeah.
2426507	2433712	And TheRobD follows that up at live.vognetwork.com says, Kurt Schilling was an idiot, but he didn't have evil intentions.
2434293	2437835	DarkSakura followed that up with, he'll need to sell $10 blowjobs.
2437995	2438696	Don't be immature.
2439796	2440457	Don't be immature.
2440497	2441057	Exactly.
2441097	2443819	To recoup those kind of losses, he's going to have to sell $100 blowjobs.
2443839	2443919	Stop.
2445751	2448455	Well, I was just thinking $10 so that he'd actually get business.
2450077	2457367	TheRobD, again, some good comments in our chatroom at live.vognetwork.com says, he has to pay for his idiocy though.
2457888	2459871	Actions have consequences.
2461049	2461630	Thanks for watching!
2476670	2479851	I mean, it's kind of sad.
2479871	2495395	I don't think the game was that bad, but the thing is, it's just not a lot of games do millions and millions of copies sold, and to just count on your game being like a tentpole AAA title that's huge, huge, huge, huge, it's not really realistic.
2496335	2502176	But the whole thing, all that being said, it blows my fucking mind that he was given the money in the first place.
2502676	2504737	Like, because somebody wrote him that check.
2506838	2509280	Is it because of the sports fame?
2509901	2517867	Is it because we're so fixated on sports in this country that it's like, oh yeah, when sports royalty walks in and wants to do something, we let them do it.
2518688	2519909	Is that what's to blame?
2520349	2522651	Is that sports royalty in our culture?
2523031	2530757	I'm pretty sure that in certain counties in California, like Hollywood and stuff like that, you could probably kill a man and get away with it.
2530777	2533340	They give you a gimme, and that's it.
2533680	2535021	It's true, it worked for OJ.
2536562	2541404	Yeah, a $75 million loan, I mean, that's... They're like, ah, you're good for it.
2541464	2543405	You're a baseball star, right?
2543505	2543745	No?
2546006	2548027	There's no possible way we're going to lose on this.
2549528	2552169	SSJ100 Matt in our chat says it was because he was Curt Schilling.
2552229	2553089	So you're saying I'm right?
2553770	2554250	Question mark?
2555891	2561773	Well, keep in mind this is the same country that's letting a convicted rapist go free.
2562974	2565915	And the director, the movie director...
2568557	2568797	What?
2569458	2569918	Never mind.
2570299	2570879	Paul W.S.
2570959	2571840	Anderson, I swear.
2574041	2574342	All right.
2575122	2580967	And Tiger Claw follows it up saying, yeah, it's got to be because he was a baseball player and the fact he was a World Series winning baseball player.
2581527	2591715	So anyhow, let's just like no one give like, you know, basketball stars this kind of money either for game ideas because would they have given that money to Dennis Rodman?
2592275	2593136	We did have Shaq Fu.
2595185	2601548	Hey, I wonder if Shaq Fu sold as many copies, if not more copies, than Knights of Amulet.
2602048	2604169	At least Shaq Fu recovered its costs, maybe.
2604189	2606129	Shaq Fu is a concept I can get behind.
2606309	2609171	Shaq Fu did not put Rhode Island's $75 million into debt.
2609191	2609651	That is true.
2609691	2610891	Shaq Fu was harmless.
2611291	2612692	Well, pretty harmless.
2612772	2616253	Shaq Fu just put me 75 minutes of my time into debt.
2616294	2616774	That's all.
2617574	2618555	It's not as big of a loss.
2618935	2624559	Ooh, I remember the game I wanted to talk about during my gaming week before we get into this next thing since we're talking about basketball.
2624839	2626040	Do you know what I saw at the mall?
2626620	2628962	A demo kiosk for NBA Baller Beats.
2629642	2631764	And I so badly... That looked awkward.
2632064	2636347	I so badly wanted to play it, but I was with my friend, Victoria, and she was judging me so hard.
2636367	2637648	She's like, listen, you're too white for this.
2637688	2638688	You're too white for this.
2639229	2640209	You're not going to do that.
2640249	2641010	Basically.
2641530	2644012	And thanks to SSJ100, Matt, it was Roman Pileski.
2645670	2647111	Oh, that whole thing.
2647151	2649832	Oh, yeah, that's a bit of a mess, isn't it?
2650573	2652794	Anyhow, NBA Baller Beats.
2652874	2655815	I got to say, say what you will.
2655995	2656576	Say what you would.
2656636	2658036	Judge me all you want.
2658337	2659477	I don't give a fuck.
2660238	2661038	It looked fun.
2661318	2661818	I'm sorry.
2662038	2663079	It looked fun.
2668647	2673888	I can get my boss to give me the copy that we have because it's just sitting there on his desk.
2673908	2674549	I want to play it.
2674609	2675469	I'm not going to lie.
2675729	2677729	I'm just waiting for it to go in the clearance bin.
2677990	2680030	It won't take much longer.
2680050	2681670	I'm going to check fries once a week.
2681731	2683871	It'll be a manager special before we know it.
2685171	2686592	Do they even have them for sale there?
2690362	2690963	All right, moving on.
2691583	2693264	Rhode Island's not the only one that's lost money.
2694025	2700569	Sony, talking about their finances, made a net loss of 15.5 billion yen.
2700589	2705752	That translates to just under $200 million in their second fiscal quarter.
2706113	2709575	Their gaming division has seen a year-on-year decline in profit.
2709935	2711797	This is a year-on-year reduction in loss of 42.6%.
2711877	2714999	That's an improvement over the $312 million they lost during the first quarter.
2720703	2727491	The company has lowered their projections for the end of the year for the PSP and the Vita sales significantly.
2727571	2730154	That's down to 10 million from what they originally projected.
2730234	2733158	I don't think they're going to come out too well this year to be honest.
2734319	2739062	Kaz Hirai in May indicated a fiscal year estimate of $10 million for the Vita alone.
2739502	2744205	The PS3 and the PS2 combined estimate remains untouched at $16 million.
2744906	2750009	On the bright side, software performance saw slight growth across the second quarter.
2750690	2753952	So the PS3 and PS2 sales, they've actually rose slightly.
2754352	2756373	Let's look at the fourth quarter lineup.
2756393	2758173	They don't really have any strong titles.
2758193	2760934	They have PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, which could flop.
2761194	2766075	I mean, it's all right, but it's not going to be like Uncharted or something like that.
2766595	2769616	And they've got LittleBigPlanet Karting, which also could flop.
2769816	2771997	I mean, those are both kind of mediocre.
2772717	2777298	As far as AAA titles go, they're not like Mass Effect or Halo.
2777458	2778859	It's just kind of like, huh.
2780239	2783640	They'll do all right, but they're not going to be these huge games that people are like,
2783840	2788003	Oh my god, I'm going to line up at midnight to go get my PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale.
2788284	2789064	That's a very good point.
2789325	2790005	That's a very good point.
2790025	2791166	These games are not Halo 4.
2791306	2795770	Or like they have the new Sly Cooper game, Thieves in Time?
2796971	2797251	One of those.
2797671	2800193	Anyways, so those aren't really that strong titles.
2800314	2801775	And look at what we have for the Vita.
2801795	2804237	The two big games that they've been kind of pimping for the Vita was...
2804737	2822448	Call of Duty Black Ops Declassified which I'm afraid is going to suck in fact I'm pretty sure it's going to suck because the guys that made it were the guys that made the really shitty Resistance game that they were also pimping out really hard and was very mediocre and in Assassin's Creed which I think Assassin's Creed Liberation is actually pretty good but
2823768	2824309	Here's the thing.
2824329	2827970	If Sony is losing this money, and Sony's not really selling Vitas like they thought they would...
2841756	2844499	Do we really think we're going to get a PlayStation 4 next year?
2844760	2846742	Do we still think that's something that's going to happen?
2846782	2855031	Because I'm really starting to think a lot of this stuff that we're hearing about game industry troubles because this is not the first we've heard of this.
2855091	2856633	We've heard about layoffs, etc., etc.,
2857694	2858174	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2877012	2882276	They're alright, but they're not like these big launch tentpole titles or something like that.
2882296	2883697	It's not like a new Uncharted.
2883717	2888441	I mean, they had a new Uncharted last year, but it's not like a big, huge title like that.
2888461	2896407	I think that they're having these dev teams working on something for the next system so they have a strong launch because they know they need that.
2898569	2899270	It's hard to say, though.
2899290	2902732	I mean, I think that they're going to have to probably drop the price of the Vita pretty soon because...
2903783	2906845	There's not a whole ton of stuff that's really a selling point.
2906905	2910186	Had I not gotten one, there's not really anything that would have sold me on one.
2910507	2915249	Although if they announce a portable Grand Theft Auto 5 game, I'm probably going to have to buy that.
2915349	2917110	Any Grand Theft Auto game, I'm probably going to have to buy.
2917130	2918711	I don't really care what system it's on.
2919311	2923274	YYR in our chatroom says, I played LittleBigPlanet Karting at New York Comic Con.
2923294	2924114	There were no lines.
2924154	2928417	It was actually quite fun, but I walked away thinking, will I pay $60 for this?
2928918	2929158	No.
2930178	2934321	Rob D says at live.vognetwork.com, we absolutely need a new system.
2934681	2937263	That said, we also need to reevaluate the game industry.
2937363	2941266	The problem is that companies only change things up when we get new systems.
2941306	2943967	You know, that's kind of along the same line I'm thinking of.
2944608	2947630	Not so much that we absolutely need a new system, but the whole...
2948470	2951472	I kind of think the PS3's potential hasn't really been realized.
2952373	2958157	Because the PS3 does 3D gaming, but is that really a thing that people are doing right now?
2958337	2958537	No.
2959158	2962560	So what is the PS4 going to bring us that the PS3's not doing?
2962580	2967243	You have to understand, they've already kind of gotten away from trying to promote 3D as a big thing now.
2967263	2969104	They don't even really mention it too much anymore.
2969485	2974248	And even with 3D TVs, people aren't really sold on 3D TVs, so now they're pushing that whole 4K thing.
2974948	2979789	The Ultra HD TVs So is that going to be the PlayStation 4's big thing?
2979849	2996574	Yeah, I think that was one of the rumored specs is it's going to do that 4K resolution thing But if the PlayStation 3 couldn't get people to adopt 3D successfully Although, to be fair, Blu-ray probably won in large part to the PlayStation 3
2998900	3015707	So, I mean, for every maybe failure, you could say that there's been a win But I'm just not convinced that people are going to be like, oh, I need this PlayStation 4 right fucking now Oh, and I need a new Sony Ultra HD TV as well to play... what?
3016107	3023330	Because you're going to think that any games that are coming out at launch are probably just going to be... They're probably not going to be utilizing that
3025867	3026128	One more.
3026288	3027709	Let me do one more comment here from chat.
3027749	3029310	The chat's got a lot of good points tonight.
3029450	3035615	YYR says, I really think that smartphones and the sort of success of the 3DS have killed the Vita's potential market.
3036075	3040398	I really think it's a great system and I'm really enjoying the game library despite its small size.
3040799	3045062	But how many people want one if they have smartphones, a 3DS, or both?
3045943	3047664	I don't even touch my DS at all.
3047824	3048845	I play on my phone.
3049507	3052048	I would argue that the 3DS is kind of hurting too.
3052188	3054588	I mean, we're hearing a very similar story out of Nintendo.
3054608	3059169	It might not be as dire, but Nintendo's lowered expectations of 3DS sales as well.
3060329	3072912	But I do think you're onto something that a lot of it has to do with tablets, smartphones, which is why when you bring out your device and you say it plays Netflix, that was a waste of breath.
3074332	3080694	The fact that your device, Wii U, plays Netflix, that's an expectation now.
3081694	3084915	That's as much of an expectation of it does widescreen.
3085815	3087516	It does HD.
3087616	3088436	It does Netflix.
3088836	3090176	That's like a baseline thing now.
3090897	3095838	So what makes your device better than...
3096738	3102022	A tablet or a smartphone that, you know, far more people have in their pockets and so forth.
3102342	3104583	I think that's a big part of it, too.
3105244	3106625	iPad Mini ain't gonna help.
3108006	3108806	I'm gonna be honest.
3108846	3118172	I mean, like, I've got a smartphone and I have an iPod Touch, you know, 4G, and I don't really use either of them for gaming.
3119693	3120414	Just don't.
3120534	3122215	I mean, even, like, my portable systems.
3122255	3126098	I'm kind of reevaluating whether I even need portable gaming systems because I don't.
3126718	3127599	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3143088	3151190	We used to play on the PSP because it was portable and we could get a group of people together and play Grand Theft Auto and stuff.
3151471	3162114	That may be a case where I'd want a system like that to play Grand Theft Auto or some multiplayer game so that we can move around and stuff, be a little bit nomadic.
3162694	3162874	But
3164075	3168019	I don't find the need to have that stuff anymore, it seems like.
3168139	3174146	Even with all the systems, I don't really feel the need, next generation, to own all of the systems.
3176068	3179772	Even before, I felt this expectation because I do this show, oh, I should own all of them.
3180240	3183601	Nope, not really feeling it anymore because I don't play the Wii at all.
3183781	3185282	The Wii is literally collecting dust.
3185322	3187362	I have something stacked on top of it and that was it.
3187862	3191684	We dusted off the other day just to play Sight Truck.
3191744	3192664	I should say my wife did.
3193164	3197585	But I haven't played anything on that for years now.
3197985	3199366	And the PlayStation 3, same thing.
3200466	3206048	We're looking at maybe using the PlayStation 3 for Grand Theft Auto V because it doesn't get disconnected through our firewalls quick, but
3206728	3209889	I haven't played anything on that for like a long time.
3211969	3212669	Jamie, quick thought?
3213270	3229173	Well, I was just saying I haven't really... I mean, Dan and I have actually talked about downsizing our collection, you know, because really it's anything that we've wanted to play, I can get on my PC and I can upgrade my PC at any point.
3230534	3232194	It just really isn't, you know...
3234283	3243230	and the other thing too is also look at in terms of the economy people I think this has been the case for us are really looking at needs versus wants
3244167	3245487	A gaming system is a want.
3245507	3246828	It's not something you need.
3247768	3248789	We need to pay rent.
3249389	3252410	And that became the priority.
3253230	3255311	I wasn't working at the time.
3256071	3257852	Any of my money couldn't go towards games.
3257972	3260012	It went towards buying food, paying bills.
3260852	3263413	And in this case... Damn responsibility.
3263513	3263813	Damn it.
3263853	3271196	Well, yeah, but if you look at it, the vast majority of people have been put into the circumstance, instead of having disposable income...
3271676	3274843	They're realizing that, yeah, maybe I don't need this stuff.
3274983	3276206	Maybe it's just a bonus.
3277239	3278679	Let me read a few more comments from chat.
3278699	3281860	We'll end on these chat comments and go on into DarkSakura's next story.
3282560	3285000	But there's such a good discussion going on in chat tonight.
3285020	3287301	I just got to throw these out there for the podcast listeners to hear.
3288041	3292462	YYR says, The 3DS can also fall back on Nintendo's excellent software.
3292522	3293722	Don't forget Pokemon.
3294122	3298803	We haven't really had a... The Pokemon games that just came out were for the last DS, which is fascinating.
3298823	3301884	That's how confident that they were that those games were going to do well on the 3DS.
3301924	3303224	And they're probably right, to be fair.
3303784	3306866	Dungeon Buster says, I think I butchered that sentence there, but just the whole thinking ahead point.
3328421	3353390	and lastly Doom Plague says I would be surprised if anyone made a 4k resolution game in the next 10 years it's a non-factor this coming generation all right we could talk about this for a lot longer but I think this discussion is going to be continuing through the next six months right on up to the next E3 when we know what these systems if they're coming at all for one and what they will entail in the meantime let's go to DarkSakura with the next story
3353564	3355665	How about a tale of some corporate fucking greed?
3360548	3369294	Frank Christopher Oliveira, who is the former GameStop VP of Corporate Communications and Public Affairs, got caught.
3370014	3373957	He pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud for embezzling $1,965,900 from GameStop.
3378961	3391362	And in the indictment, he sent payments from January 2009 through April 2011 to Cloud Communications LLC, which was a fictitious company he owned to transfer funds into his personal account.
3395432	3402497	GameStop is no comment, however they are fully cooperating with the federal investigation.
3403437	3409822	He pleaded not guilty and the max sentence to this is 20 years in prison and $250,000 fine.
3412143	3434601	and I hope that he gets the max you know penalty I wish that all of these corporate bastards who steal money from the companies they work for and get away with you know fraud and stealing money out of the consumers pockets get caught too instead of being given you know personhood and all this bullshit just saying people need to be held accountable
3435200	3435601	and DarkSakura.com
3446025	3454591	Just another sign of how people in positions of power in companies are really abusing their positions.
3455311	3460495	And in return, who has to pay for recouping those losses?
3460555	3462996	It goes back to the consumer when they're figuring out their money's missing.
3463577	3466939	Ranma makes a very tongue-in-cheek comment in our chatroom, but it's worth repeating.
3467319	3468500	Steal from GameStop?
3468760	3470481	Sure, they've stolen from me enough times.
3471582	3475705	Yeah, but this is a guy who probably already is a millionaire.
3477224	3485429	You have to remember this is a guy who was feeding money that they already got from you into these fake companies and what have you.
3485669	3488451	It's just amazing he was able to do that much.
3488711	3491552	I want them to nail his ass to the wall.
3493593	3495094	It goes back to a bigger problem.
3495595	3503319	It goes back to more people looking at their own personal greed as opposed to being a better person maybe.
3503519	3505444	Are you saying look at your life, look at your choices?
3505485	3506828	Yeah, look at your life, look at your choices.
3507249	3508493	Don't be a corporate douchette.
3509876	3510578	All right, fair enough.
3510679	3511360	Loki, let's move on.
3512398	3512698	All right.
3514059	3523022	So let's talk a little bit about one game I'm very looking forward to, and that would be Grand Theft Auto V. And of course... Since when were you a Grand Theft Auto fan?
3523382	3525123	You're just getting on the bandwagon.
3525163	3526363	It's been a long time.
3527384	3534666	But I'm gearing up because this month is going to be a lot of news for Grand Theft Auto V. I bet you suddenly became a Giants fan last week, too.
3534967	3538288	Yeah, I had to become a sports fan first, so that's not going to happen.
3539188	3542850	Grant the Thought of Five, of course, there was a whole bunch of rumors of when it is expected to come out.
3542950	3549514	I've already said that it's going to be April or May next year, but they've officially confirmed that, yes, spring 2003 is going to be the release window for the game.
3549914	3558759	And they have some promotional materials that are making it out to GameStops and other places, including Game and stuff internationally.
3559479	3562721	and along with that, some of the promotional stuff.
3563081	3569425	Starting on Monday, November 5th, you can actually pre-order the game from different locations.
3570005	3580130	The rumor was that they were supposed to be doing another trailer on the 5th, although because of the whole hurricane slash storm, it's put them a little bit behind as far as getting that trailer cut.
3580231	3584533	So expect the trailer next week, which I'm really expecting for next week.
3585153	3603668	and they've got some cool little promotional items if you're able to pre-order your game early enough because it's going to be extremely limited supplies you can get a keychain type thing that has like almost like a little viewfinder on there and you can check out some of the locations including they've got Vinewood Hills which is like Hollywood and
3604388	3626708	The Del Perro Pier, like Santa Monica The Vespucci Canals, I guess that's kind of like a downtown LA Grape Seed, which is kind of like Napa Oh boy So it looks interesting Because Napa is so close to LA
3627887	3642809	whatever you know it's just like well San Andreas they had San Francisco Vegas and yeah I know I know it's it's a video game exactly it's all fixed it's all fictitious anyway so right right um and then they've got new posters and stuff like that with like a Lindsay Lohan looking woman on the front
3643490	3644670	Thank you for watching!
3666895	3667495	Very excited.
3668476	3671377	Trying to take your mind off of some of the holiday games that are coming out right now.
3671817	3673337	I'm looking forward to spring.
3673517	3680880	Well, I'm only picking... The last game I'm picking up this... Well, actually, I should say not the last game, but the second to last game I'm picking up this year is Black Ops 2, followed by Far Cry 3.
3681360	3683201	So those will be the last two games I'm getting.
3683421	3685842	And then maybe Halo 4.
3685882	3686202	I don't know.
3686222	3686482	We'll see.
3687162	3690263	Well, there are going to be a lot of people picking up Halo 4 this week.
3690323	3695925	Believe it or not, it's here because, you know, the election day is this week and it's the same day Halo 4 is being released.
3696465	3699766	And retailers everywhere are going to be doing midnight releases.
3699806	3701287	GameStop is one of those retailers.
3701327	3704048	They did announce this week 4,400 of their U.S.
3704088	3707409	locations will be open at midnight to sell Halo 4.
3708409	3714011	All the stores that are participating in the event will start their events at 9 o'clock in the local time zone.
3714511	3721033	Do keep in mind, if you're in an area that was impacted by Hurricane Sandy, that may have screwed up some of these GameStops.
3721053	3722673	There's still a lot of places without power.
3723093	3726214	So when in doubt, call ahead and just make sure.
3727274	3733916	Probably if your store did Assassin's Creed 3, it's probably doing Halo 4, but it's always best to just call ahead.
3733936	3735296	There's nothing wrong with placing a phone call.
3735316	3740698	If the store that you pre-ordered your game happens to be a playing trade, you're not getting it at midnight.
3742678	3743279	All righty then.
3743679	3750646	Well, I do want to point out, even though GameStop, there's probably a shit ton of other retailers doing the midnight release as well.
3751306	3762256	I'm sure Walmart's, Best Buy's probably, and basically any place that sells video games will probably be open at midnight because Halo 4 is kind of a big deal.
3763277	3770321	Now, one other thing I want to talk about with Halo 4 is this interesting little report that's going around the internet this week.
3772462	3783067	343 Industries apparently not happy with some of the language that players use when they're playing Halo, to which I say, good, make the shit talkers take some accountability.
3784307	3795451	The studio head of 343 Industries, Bonnie Ross, in an interview with GameSpot said, "...I've seen many of the sites that have documented some of the more gender-specific, slanderous comments.
3795951	3800033	This is behavior that is offensive and completely unacceptable.
3800493	3805275	I'd like to think most of our Xbox Live players don't support this kind of behavior."
3807998	3810800	Sorry, just like most of them.
3811101	3812382	That's the best name ever.
3813002	3813262	Yeah.
3834660	3837421	Microsoft can't exactly monitor live games, can they?
3837521	3837701	Well,
3865598	3866419	I'm sure they have a way.
3882142	3887806	Now, I read this story at Destructoid, destructoid.com, and they bring up a really good point that I think is worth repeating.
3887866	3893049	They take issue with the fact that adolescents are the only ones being targeted as being jerks online.
3893750	3895511	And they say in this article, quote,
3898453	3926746	Who get their jollies by going into online games and being nasty Or who attempt to bully others because of perceived differences I think that's a damn good point Wasn't there a story around the internet this week or maybe last week About the Reddit trolls and the people posting the really, really bad stuff to Reddit And they traced it back to some 39-year-old guy Just one of your stereotypical basement-going people with nothing better to do And it bears to be repeated
3927586	3945451	Halo 4 is a fucking mature rated game so kids shouldn't be playing in the first place but parents are fucking dumb or I should say parents have made the choice to have their kids play this mature rated game at that same time they should also be responsible for what they say or what they're exposed to
3947135	3963374	Bonds006 in our chatroom says people still cry over what's being said online in a game I'm not sure if I'm taking that like if there's like a hint of sarcasm or something to that comment but like yes and people should take issue to some of the things that are said online in a game like I'm sorry but
3964034	3970456	I've been in Halo matches where I've heard people called faggot and far worse words I'm not going to say on this show.
3971136	3973256	Although they're all bad, let's be real.
3973676	3978217	But it's just like, yes, I take issue to that.
3978477	3984719	As a gay guy who got called that a lot growing up in a very malicious way, who still has many...
3985459	3986860	and DarkSakura.com
4013595	4014335	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4032907	4046532	The Big C-Bomb, then that better be a term of endearment or some prearranged thing and not in a negative thing because that's not okay to be calling women at random that word.
4046972	4047452	You know what I mean?
4048572	4052394	Or even bitch, whore, slut, all those other things.
4053694	4054194	Right, Jamie?
4055235	4056255	I'm kind of not bothered.
4057515	4062497	So you don't care if you go online and do a random match on Halo 4 and somebody drops the C-Bomb?
4063530	4063690	No.
4065071	4072094	I mean, because really all I'll do, like, for example, it actually happened in WoW not too long ago, and all I did was just report and put them on ignore.
4072154	4072734	What about my game?
4073975	4083659	Well, okay, then it didn't get under your skin, but you recognize that, hey, this person should probably have their freedom to play the game taken away from them, right?
4083700	4085420	This person is not mature enough to be in this game.
4085440	4088182	I think that their ability to speak in said game should be revoked.
4088442	4088622	Mm-hmm.
4089442	4095466	I don't necessarily think they shouldn't be allowed to play the game because maybe they're good at it.
4096026	4098568	I just think that their ability to speak should be revoked.
4099409	4104052	I mean, because that's almost more frustrating is not being able to say something to somebody.
4104732	4115319	And, you know, honestly, I like when you have a feature to just actively ignore something and then have it pop up reverting to them.
4116259	4117360	X person has you ignored.
4118940	4134376	then what good is saying anything going to do when the person that you're saying it at can't react isn't going to react to it the people are only doing that for attention they're only doing that because they get something off on it if you're not if they're not bothered by it what good is it going to do
4135342	4139643	I seem to remember Halo 3 had a really quick way to block people like that.
4139743	4148945	I remember reporting on some of the stories that you could just hit the back button and it just shut them up automatically, which I thought was pretty neat.
4150025	4156507	That's what I think it should be, but I think that they also need to get the feedback in return that this person isn't paying attention to you.
4157612	4164018	I don't think that they should because actually it's better if they don't know that because then they can't go, oh, you're not going to listen to me.
4164178	4165699	I'm going to send an angry message at you.
4166340	4167661	No, it should completely block them.
4170263	4173586	TheRobD, I think this is a very interesting point in chat.
4173606	4174526	I just want to throw this out there.
4174626	4175707	Live.VogNetwork.com.
4175747	4184435	TheRobD says, the only way we can improve the quality and diversity of gamers online is to hold them accountable for what they do.
4185211	4185892	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4203204	4211190	Definitely hold people accountable, but I'm saying that it's kind of hard for me to try to think of how to phrase it.
4211931	4218856	There are really thin-skinned people out there who, you know, even just saying, oh, you suck is going to piss them off.
4219496	4223379	You know, it's going to make them, you know, be in a world of boohoo.
4223439	4225981	And maybe if they're that thin-skinned, they shouldn't play.
4227471	4228572	I think I see what you're getting at.
4228812	4238476	You're saying that maybe this opens the door to that total political correctness, hypersensitivity, these types of issues.
4238536	4240396	It's like, where do you draw the line?
4240737	4254242	I mean, I think we can all agree you don't say certain words ever online, but somebody who might be ultra-religious, grew up in Little House on the Prairie...
4254582	4261315	has every right to play the same Xbox games you do, but would never say the word damn themselves and might take offense to that.
4262398	4271082	I know people who, like a lady in one of my classes who is as Mormon as Mormon can be, doesn't drink coffee, none of that, and she's perfectly fine with other people.
4271362	4275323	She doesn't, you know, she doesn't go la la la la la when someone says crap, you know.
4276024	4278324	But at the same time, she won't do that thing herself.
4278765	4283687	And she won't put herself in a position to where she's surrounded by it all the time.
4284367	4289249	And now if she's in a situation that she can't get away from, she understands and accepts that that's a situation she can't get away with it.
4290449	4291770	Get away from it, you know what I mean?
4292450	4300513	And my big problem, and this actually sort of goes back to the whole big political correctness thing, you know what I mean?
4301834	4308637	Is that there are people who do take shit way too seriously.
4309077	4316160	Now there's just some people who, you know, maybe in a moment of frustration are like, well, shit, you suck, you know, I'm just using something, you know?
4316440	4320002	I've heard Dan drop a C-bomb at a game.
4320683	4323404	And then he will stop and go, oh my god, I didn't mean to say that.
4323965	4324265	You know?
4326106	4327447	But here's the question.
4327527	4333431	Did he say it in frustration to an NPC, the verbal equivalent of throwing the controller out the window?
4333971	4336893	Or did he actually press the push-to-talk button and call somebody?
4337613	4338574	He doesn't do that.
4338654	4344418	Dan is a lot... But he'll go, oh, that was a fucking shit move when he's playing online.
4344478	4346599	He plays Borderlands with his buddies.
4347219	4351202	But the point with it is that I think there's a very...
4355650	4360571	Trying to think of how to... There is a lot of room for...
4363900	4366422	Oversensitizing things, you know what I mean?
4366862	4381872	There would be opportunity to take action against somebody that you don't like for other reasons Like taking advantage of it to get somebody punished Just because you want to punish for something that has nothing to do with the game, right?
4382673	4390358	If it was going to be... I would rather have a strike rule I'm going to go way back and go to DDR Freak
4392414	4394383	You think the nine point system should be universal.
4395347	4396010	Explain the system.
4397122	4403848	We had a 9 point rule, which basically for horrible offenses, then yeah, they would get docked 3 points.
4404108	4405209	And it was a 3 strike.
4405550	4410014	3 really bad offenses, and yeah, they got banned after 9 points.
4411235	4423346	But if there were very minor offenses, like maybe something that was mildly inflammatory or maybe unintentionally flaming, then yeah, they got basically a 1 point warn for it.
4423926	4447908	and I don't think that it was the warnings that could go like a person could bring something to my attention as a moderator and I'd make a judgment call if I got five things about one person from the same person I'd only warn once because clearly there's something more going on and if it seems like it's legit I'll do the full three point warning for all five offenses you know that example that was my mentality towards it
4448949	4461794	When you're going into, you know, if you say that you've got somebody who's really oversensitive playing their first round of Halo 4 forever and someone, you know, just...
4463613	4465874	Let's out, you know, oh, that was fucking cheap.
4466014	4469155	Or, you know, makes one statement, oh, you don't know how to play.
4469675	4470936	I'm going mild with it.
4471356	4476037	And that person gets really butthurt and says, oh, you said something offensive to me.
4476778	4486061	You know, even in the case of constructive criticism, because I've seen people in WoW, when you try to give them feedback on how they're playing, and they go completely off on you.
4486121	4488482	Don't tell me how to fucking play my character, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
4488882	4491843	When really the person was just giving really good constructive feedback.
4492803	4493404	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4516519	4517960	There's people like that in the world.
4518000	4524687	People who will take offense to any little thing and go on a fucking rampage trying to prove that they're right.
4526128	4526729	If you know what I mean.
4527490	4530633	That's why we have so many stupid lawsuits go into effect.
4531193	4533235	Violent video game laws, all this.
4533295	4537019	We have quite a bit of hypersensitivity going on.
4540642	4552094	I'm really trying to get how... I mean, if you've got someone who, yeah, they've dropped the C-bomb three different times in one game and everyone's put out the warning on them, ban them.
4553075	4556519	If it's with their buddies and their buddies are doing it too, warn each of their buddies.
4556619	4557960	They get booted from the game for an hour.
4558020	4559582	They get a certain number of warns.
4559942	4560663	They're gone forever.
4562605	4563566	Give them a three strikes.
4565467	4567410	The DDR Freak System should be applied everywhere.
4568151	4569432	I think it was wise.
4569452	4573658	The one part you missed, if you were good, you would start to lose points every month.
4574058	4574278	Right.
4575119	4581007	But honestly, I actually did see that starting to really benefit.
4581207	4583330	And I never, ever got a point, ever.
4583954	4585995	I can fix that.
4586175	4587916	Not when they're dead.
4588216	4589257	Not when they're dead.
4589457	4599942	But my point is that if you've got someone who's having a really shitty day and they go off on someone, yeah, they should be held accountable for going off on somebody.
4600442	4601483	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4616187	4616848	Knock them out.
4616908	4619510	Don't even give a number of how many warnings you have.
4619550	4620671	Don't advertise that shit.
4621091	4623033	Don't advertise that your points will drop off.
4623794	4628037	Just say you get a certain amount of warning again, you're dropped.
4629178	4630099	It is up to us.
4630239	4631260	We can give you one strike.
4631280	4632461	We can give you three strikes.
4632962	4634243	It depends on what we see.
4635194	4637036	Alright, well gosh, we get to keep talking about this.
4637196	4638577	We've had a lot of good discussions tonight.
4638617	4639258	What's up with this?
4639338	4640820	Is this supposed to be a slow news week?
4641801	4652091	Live.VogNetwork.com We could, again, keep this topic going forever, but we do want to end, you know, at some point tonight instead of tomorrow morning, so we're going to keep moving on in the interest of time.
4652471	4656635	I think they were right about Dancer X. Why don't we go to that next story, DarkSakura?
4657839	4660121	Okay, my voice comes back.
4661542	4666725	I'm sure I've told this story before about my copy of Descent that I used to have that came on 14 discs.
4667866	4670328	And yes, I sat and installed... That was the way to play.
4671633	4671973	Report it!
4672013	4672213	Report it!
4694602	4695563	Thanks for watching!
4711076	4726045	and the big thing about this is basically he's going sort of the path of Black Mesa where it's called Descent to UDK where it's not exactly a remake but it's going to bring in the original story with some embellishments.
4726105	4733670	He's basically trying to diversify the original gameplay and emphasize the scary bits and new weapons.
4733830	4734471	New weapons was good.
4735211	4739954	But man, Descent was the first game I played that gave me motion sickness.
4742048	4763847	and I sucked at it oh man but I loved it for people our age they all remember the first time playing a game like Descent it was like it's doom in 360 degrees it's so cool it was even more than that instead of having your little space shooters where you're on rails or going through different areas you had full freedom of movement it was amazing
4764868	4776476	Um, I mean, yeah, there were more games, you know, there was when it went into Descent 3, but going back to the original and bringing in those factors that made the original great is, I think, a good idea.
4776837	4784602	There's, uh, Eurogamer actually has a, uh, um, trailer for it up on their website, and it looked pretty good.
4786563	4787664	I liked the music in Descent 2.
4787904	4788445	Mm-hmm.
4789386	4794803	Alright, let's move on and travel around the world and check out some release dates and things that are coming through more official channels this week.
4795080	4796921	Yeah, I think there's something coming out this week.
4797241	4798361	I'm sure there's a game.
4799281	4799922	We'll get to it, though.
4800642	4801262	Let's see.
4801442	4802562	What have we got this week?
4802963	4804763	What's the big game that's coming out?
4804803	4810625	Maybe it's Freaky Forms Deluxe Creations Alive on 3DS.
4810925	4811425	Is that it?
4811605	4811865	No?
4812146	4812426	Maybe?
4813806	4816167	Maybe it's a game for a system that's not out for a couple weeks.
4816247	4819328	Mass Effect 3, the special edition for the Wii U.
4821328	4822490	Yeah, I probably want to wait on that one.
4822510	4823571	Wait, that's out this week?
4824452	4825253	How does that work?
4827175	4827936	I don't know.
4828477	4829959	I think the dates need adjusting.
4829979	4830259	No, they're...
4833653	4836074	We've got in hand like Scribblenauts already.
4837815	4840577	Not that we can do anything with it.
4840637	4847781	Maybe it's Nickelodeon Bubble Guppies on the DS or Nickelodeon Team Umizoomi and Dora's Fantastic Flight.
4848361	4851963	Both rated EC for those hardcore gamers out there on the DS.
4853223	4856065	or maybe Nickelodeon Dance 2 on the Wii and Xbox 360.
4857806	4857986	No?
4858646	4858786	No?
4859727	4864129	NASCAR The Game Inside Line on PS3, Xbox 360 and Wii.
4864650	4864930	Maybe?
4865330	4865450	No?
4866471	4869012	Mass Effect Trilogy on PC and Xbox 360.
4869052	4870993	That is absolutely the game.
4871533	4872454	That has everybody.
4873074	4873514	Totally.
4874615	4877437	Midway Arcade Origins on PS3 and Xbox 360 this week.
4880614	4882575	I bought that last generation.
4883335	4888638	Also, History Legends of War Patton on Xbox 360 and PS3.
4888698	4891239	Oh, I think that's coming out next year, though.
4892120	4894741	Pop Tropica Adventures on the DS.
4895521	4901064	Dragon Ball Z Budokai HD Collection on PS3 and Xbox 360.
4901925	4903606	Ragnarok Tactics on PSP.
4907168	4926235	on PSP PSP not Vita PSP they just had a Ragnarok game on Vita already it came out last week Saints Row the third the full package on PS3 and Xbox 360 let's be honest so this really has the same content that was already on disc for the last game
4929318	4937312	except for the three expansions but all the other DLC was on disc Big Time Rush Dance Party on the Wii
4940129	4966356	Rayman Origins on the 3DS Pro Evolution Soccer 2013 on the Wii LittleBigPlanet Karting on PS3 Oh, and that's right, there is a game called Halo 4 that's out on the 360 this week as well And not to be outdone, Nintendo does have a game coming out Paper Mario Sticker Star on the 3DS one week from today Reginator just made one of my favorite jokes about NASCAR NASCAR is left turn of the game
4969677	4970037	Oh boy.
4970057	4971098	You really like to go left.
4971338	4972238	You really like Tide.
4972258	4978502	Are you going to go to one of those midnight releases and pick up LittleBigPlanet Karting?
4979903	4981884	I'm not even sure if I'm going to pick up LittleBigPlanet Karting.
4981984	4984005	I want to play it, but I haven't played LittleBigPlanet 2.
4985999	4987060	So, probably not.
4987940	4989361	Although I do like carding games.
4989881	4991922	I'd be a little bit more motivated to play that.
4992422	4998866	All I'm going to say, I know you haven't seen Wreck-It Ralph yet, I'm not going to spoil it for you, but they need to make Sugar Rush a real game.
4999066	5000186	Yes, they do.
5000867	5003248	Because that was fucking outstanding.
5003288	5004889	I would play the hell out of Sugar Rush.
5004949	5010252	Wreck-It Ralph is in the new Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing game, Transformed.
5010772	5012813	Well, I hope there's a track or something.
5012833	5013333	Vanellope.
5013553	5014834	Yeah, Vanellope von Schweetz.
5015569	5041961	which by the way there's actually a commercial for Sugar Rush oh yeah that was done as a sort of trailer for Wreck-It Ralph nice um talking about the arcade they're getting it in four quarters on your birthday I so want to say a quote from the ending and I can't say it because it's a spoiler but it's one of the like you got to know what I'm talking about I was laughing so hard it was the funniest thing in the movie like I'll tell you later off air I don't want to spoil it
5042541	5045363	Alright, let's spoil some Japanese release dates.
5045643	5048644	Did you know that Japan is also getting Halo 4 this week?
5048784	5051086	And they're getting some new Xbox 360s to come along with it.
5051126	5054087	For all those Japanese Halo fans, there you go.
5054327	5056408	Both of you guys can get that this week.
5057509	5061071	Also coming out this week on the Xbox 360, Tropico 4 Gold Edition.
5061111	5063212	I think that's just a price reduction of an existing game.
5063872	5066033	It's a re-release they're doing.
5066333	5067414	It's the game with the expansion.
5068893	5089616	on the Playstation 3 Silent Hill Downpour finally on the Playstation 3 in Japan this week Shin Sengoku Musou 6 Empires Hokuto Musou International getting a price reduction from Koei as well as a price reduction for Champion Jockey, G1 Jockey and Gallop Racer for those of you that like your horsey racing games in Japan
5090096	5092837	and the really embarrassing Move integration.
5093457	5094757	Oh, is that the other big thing?
5095097	5099279	Remember the one that looks like you're playing Final Furlong?
5099379	5100439	Final Furlong, yeah.
5100619	5101759	That game was amazing.
5101859	5102719	Horse humping the game?
5103460	5103880	Let's see.
5104140	5107121	Lastly, when do we get Wii U stuff in Japan?
5107141	5107501	Oh, that's right.
5107541	5108861	They don't get it until December, huh?
5110021	5111802	I don't start reading those release dates until December.
5113263	5114604	How about the Nintendo 3DS?
5115665	5131817	Another 3DS LL, which is basically their XL pack It's a Dobutsu no Mori pack, limited edition Because Tobidase Dobutsu no Mori comes out this week on the Nintendo 3DS And what is Dobutsu no Mori?
5132057	5139443	Animal Forest, aka Animal Crossing That's right, Animal Crossing is the big release on the 3DS Technically that would be Animals Forest
5140163	5143909	Now, if Animal Crossing isn't your thing, maybe you're more into Jewel Pet.
5145973	5151416	Mahou de Osare ni Dance Deco comes out this week as well on the 3DS.
5151996	5160860	That's fantastic that the 3DS isn't region-free like the DS was because, you know, people then can't import games that they like to play.
5160920	5164442	It would be very hard to play Animal Crossing anyway because it's all in Japanese.
5164522	5173907	I freaking tried on my Doubutsu no Mori for GameCube and even being... I read so slowly it takes an hour to do anything.
5174369	5187492	I don't know if you guys know this, but when the little characters read when they're talking, in the Japanese version of the game, they were saying the little Japanese syllables really quick, so it sounded like they were actually talking.
5187872	5194713	But in the English version, you can't really do that same thing, so they would say the letters of the alphabet real fast.
5194893	5200314	And see, that's why I wanted the Japanese one to play, because I thought it would help me with my listening comprehension.
5201655	5201875	No.
5202315	5203415	It went way too fast.
5204286	5206047	How about the UK, DarkSakura?
5206868	5208629	We have a few selections for the UK.
5208889	5210390	On November 6th is Halo 4.
5211191	5215014	On the 7th is Curiosity for iPhone, PC, Android, and iPad.
5216735	5219957	I hope the cube contains eternal joy.
5221018	5223260	Karateka for Xbox 360.
5225514	5226195	When is the weekend?
5226215	5227056	Are you going to get the cube?
5227676	5228677	Do you want to know what's in the cube?
5228717	5230319	Curiosity, what's in the fucking cube?
5230479	5231240	What's in the box?
5232040	5232921	What's in the fucking box?
5232941	5233862	Tell me what's in the box!
5233922	5240568	I still have to update my iOS version, but I would like to pirate it just for the principle of the thing.
5241445	5243867	On November 8th, we have Angry Birds Star Wars.
5245628	5253094	On the 9th, Little Big Planet Karting and Mass Effect Trilogy, which I'm going to make my husband get me.
5254635	5255236	And that's it.
5256492	5261036	I hope you did realize that LittleBigPlanet Karting is not coming on the Vita at launch.
5262337	5266100	But if I buy it on the PS3, I'll still get my free Vita, right?
5266320	5267381	Isn't that part of the deal?
5267662	5269143	I haven't seen the sticker on the box.
5269843	5274848	I know it's on the box for the PlayStation All-Stars stuff, but at the same time, I don't really want that game.
5275308	5276650	That's not even going to sell that for me.
5276830	5277050	Mm-hmm.
5277369	5280411	By the way, you know what I totally love about playing Mass Effect on the PC?
5280551	5280771	What?
5281451	5284493	Is hacking the coalesced INI file to get other outfits.
5284673	5286734	And you wonder why you can't get online in part three.
5286814	5291456	No, I reinstalled the fucker and it wasn't working.
5291636	5292977	So bite my booty.
5293397	5293897	Reported.
5296899	5299282	Alright, just a couple more news stories for you guys.
5299622	5301644	And then the classic game of the week.
5301964	5303085	Back when games worked.
5303986	5304386	Loki.
5305628	5311153	So yes, there's a patent firm, and I don't even know why these things exist, but whatever.
5311993	5318580	A Texas company has filed a lawsuit against Wizards of the Coast.
5318700	5323524	Or not against Wizards of the Coast, I guess Hasbro, who has the Magic of the Gathering online game.
5323564	5327468	I didn't even realize Hasbro does online games, but okay, I guess I got into video gaming.
5328089	5330331	So anyways, so Magic of the Gathering online, um...
5332132	5334813	It's been out there for a while now, 10 years.
5335493	5344036	And I guess this wildcat, Intellectual Property Holdings of Dallas, they're filing a lawsuit against them to get it taken offline.
5344496	5351898	I guess they hold the patent for Unit Commander, which calls, I guess, the ultimate mercenary trading card game.
5352698	5354639	And they're saying that it infringes on that.
5355936	5366400	Which something tells me that they probably had Magic the Gathering out there for a lot longer than they've had the patent for Unit Commander.
5367781	5372383	Which I might add is about as generic as their patent for said game.
5374648	5374988	I don't know.
5375248	5375689	We'll see.
5377870	5380392	We'll see if they even... I don't think anything's really going to happen.
5380492	5383694	Pat and Troll, what are you going to do?
5384055	5387517	It really does astound me that Magic the Gathering is still going after all this time.
5387597	5388578	Pretty strong, you know?
5388858	5390880	There was just a tournament here locally over the weekend.
5390900	5391400	Did you know that?
5392401	5393041	I wouldn't doubt it.
5393181	5395643	People still play this like mad.
5395703	5397064	And I still suck at it.
5399172	5400373	Dragon Quest VII is being remade for the 3DS
5416900	5418061	Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra
5442522	5456914	that's rad very nice I really hope that comes out over here we'll see Dragon Quest 7 if you weren't aware it was originally released on the PlayStation 1 that was about 12 years ago it was released in the USA Dragon Warrior 7 yes it was
5458115	5461439	Didn't they finally go back to calling it Dragon Quest in the US with 8 though?
5461539	5462020	I thought they did.
5463161	5465624	Man, that's a PS2 game we need to go back and really beat.
5465644	5466345	Dragon Quest 8 was so good.
5466385	5469649	I remember when the demo for that was like a big thing.
5470871	5475116	So no word yet if that is coming here, but one can hope.
5476943	5477263	Dragon Quest VII
5498734	5502920	Bratz, play this game and then report me for calling you a brat.
5503962	5505164	It's the classic game of the week.
5505204	5506806	DarkSakura, what is the classic game of the week?
5506826	5507587	Spank your ass.
5508869	5509610	It's GigaWink 2.
5511073	5513637	And I'm actually specifically referring to the Dreamcast version.
5514212	5514652	Radiant Silvergun
5534551	5534951	How's that?
5535792	5542858	But anyway, the game was originally developed by Takumi and it came out on the Naomi arcade system.
5543358	5545500	And then in 2001 it came out on the Dreamcast.
5547201	5550403	It basically has like uber huge scores.
5550463	5552845	It seriously is like the ego pumping score system.
5553206	5554747	You can actually score in the quintillions.
5554987	5555487	Did you know that?
5557269	5568785	On top of that, the good thing about it being a horizontal monitor is that taking it from arcade to the home version meant that you pretty much still got the arcade treatment.
5569185	5573952	You didn't have to worry about rotating your TV or anything on edge or any of that.
5574632	5575393	and DarkSakura
5590371	5594113	So you had a ton of different fighters.
5595013	5597695	A good half of them actually were unlocked.
5598235	5602837	You could have Kingfisher, Sparrow, Raven, Stork, and Albatross.
5603157	5615063	And then you could have the Raijin, Purchka, Stranger, Carmine, and Wilderstand, which were from the first Giggling.
5616451	5625035	The soundtrack was super awesome, and I even remembered when you could get the soundtrack, it came with the soundtrack for Mars Matrix, which is another game I probably should do.
5626296	5627797	But the music is all orchestral.
5627817	5629578	It should turn up a little bit if you want.
5634781	5636162	They had a really great soundtrack.
5636182	5639683	I mean, really, in the end, it's a shooter, yeah.
5640603	5647445	But it's definitely one that people should check out, especially since the Dreamcast is still kind of around and kicking.
5648286	5649066	And it's pretty.
5649866	5659570	And the other thing about that, too, is that it's basically around... The gameplay itself is around the absorption and reflection type mechanics.
5659750	5662671	It's huge boss fights, tons of enemies.
5663451	5667132	It's, I wouldn't quite say it's a bullet hell as much as it is an enemy hell.
5668152	5671053	But I love the level scrolling and the design.
5671193	5677755	It's like, it adds another layer of depth even if it is a top-down type shooter.
5678535	5680796	So, definitely worth playing.
5681876	5685597	Alrighty, some Dreamcast love from DarkSakura this week in the Classic Game of the Week.
5685637	5686497	It is Giga Wing 2.
5687418	5687618	Yep.
5687898	5688958	Worth the Dreamcast.
5690518	5691339	Very nice pick.
5692861	5693281	Let's see.
5693702	5699248	YYR in the chat room says, GigaWing2 is also the only shmup I know of that supports four simultaneous players.
5699948	5700369	Exactly.
5701505	5701825	All right.
5702705	5704926	Well, that is going to do it for Part A of our show.
5704946	5705546	But don't go anywhere.
5705586	5712507	There is plenty more Orange Launch Radio to come tonight, including the Fugle Question of the Week, some details on the Wii U's browser.
5712567	5715228	It's going to be very interesting, as well as some other Nintendo details.
5715968	5718649	And Mega Man Wily Wars.
5718969	5721729	If you don't know about this game, it may have fallen off your radar.
5721749	5722449	It's not a new game.
5722469	5723510	It's a game from many, many years ago.
5723530	5724430	It was for the Genesis.
5724910	5726370	It never came out in the U.S.
5727190	5728270	until now.
5728671	5730511	So we'll be talking about that after the break.
5736798	5745945	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio live at the Voice of Geeks Network, VOGnetwork.com with the 480th episode of our show.
5747146	5752631	Possibly a different time for some of you tonight because there was that whole daylight savings that happened over the weekend.
5753051	5755573	And you know what they say, spring forward, fall back.
5755633	5758015	So everybody got an extra hour of sleep last night.
5758635	5759156	I needed it.
5759476	5763419	Or if you were me, you got home at 4 in the morning instead of 5 in the morning.
5764760	5770266	That was my lucky thing, but that's what I get for going to the Bay Area and staying out late and then driving home the same night.
5770346	5770667	Why?
5771107	5774871	Because I had Starbucks and I wasn't feeling tired.
5775672	5779356	Hooray, by the way, for Peppermint Mochas being back at Starbucks.
5779616	5781418	I guess technically you can get those any time of the year.
5781598	5782639	You can also get them sugar-free.
5782918	5800118	but yeah they have the skinny ones now which is great but you know what they don't have yet is the gingerbread lattes and those are amazing anyway it's not a coffee cast it's a video game cast it's just you know coffee is sometimes how we get through the day we will get back to video games Rob coffee is how I get through my life
5801159	5804162	I do want to mention the elections are this week, you might have heard.
5804262	5806324	So, of course, if you live in the U.S.
5806524	5810047	or, you know, a country that lets you vote, you probably should vote.
5810868	5812530	It is your right after all.
5812870	5816513	And remember, you do not get to bitch about the results if you do not vote.
5816813	5822038	And I, for one, can't wait for those frickin' election calls to stop calling me on my phone every ten minutes.
5822378	5826142	I did, however, get to call Dan Lundgren a dick.
5826702	5827303	Or he would hear it.
5828476	5829156	Smart Glass Member
5849745	5853146	We knew that Forza Horizon was going to use smart glass, but it kind of wasn't.
5853327	5854767	So now it is.
5855127	5862670	And so they've got some really cool stuff with that, including an in-game map that you can use, which is kind of cool.
5862930	5868753	And I guess it allows you to do all the same stuff that you can do by pausing the game, but now without pausing the game.
5868793	5871474	And you can set destination GPSs and all that stuff.
5873479	5874241	Might be kind of cool.
5874501	5875785	I'd have to check that out, I guess.
5876427	5878112	Because Forza looks like it might be fun.
5878573	5879977	Have to ask Bobby if he's tried it yet.
5880625	5882746	He did a review at vognetwork.com.
5882806	5883686	He would tell you to go read.
5884006	5886026	Well, I understand that, but I meant about the smart glass thing.
5886126	5886926	Oh, the smart glass.
5887046	5887827	Oh, I don't know about that.
5889447	5891667	He's busy with the football stuff.
5893148	5894408	I played the demo for Forza.
5894488	5898549	I didn't do the smart glass thing because I don't think that's in the demo, but I like the demo.
5899269	5900429	I might pick up the game.
5900729	5901070	I don't know.
5901130	5903150	It's kind of like there's just so much right now that...
5903490	5905891	I have that racing wheel, man, that's been collecting dust.
5906191	5910211	I kind of need to use that, so I may have to pick it up to try that.
5911572	5913112	Excellent.
5913292	5915953	Also, something that's kind of cool, that Shootmania Storm.
5916033	5920714	I was kind of a fan of Trackmania, and so now they're getting into the other type of games.
5921274	5925555	Shootmania being their kind of first-person shooter arena battle game.
5925995	5932556	Although, I mean, one of the things about the whole Mania series is that you can customize everything, including the game types and all that.
5932916	5960159	and share those so it is going to be I guess coming soon in a beta form and that'll be out in December and then the game is expected to arrive on January 23rd which is going to be kind of cool and I guess the beta is going to also have like you know welcome build they're going to have a couple new game modes and stuff like one they mentioned is laser jump and wall jump and grappling hook and
5961019	5965141	I can't help but think, but looking at this stuff, it'd be kind of cool as like a 3D laser tag game.
5965661	5966982	That might be pretty awesome.
5967802	5968843	Oh, you and laser tag.
5969123	5970043	Fucking love laser tag.
5970063	5971564	When was the last time you went to like a QZAR?
5971964	5972624	It's been a while.
5972985	5973445	That's too bad.
5973625	5975066	I miss the QZARs.
5975866	5978267	They still have that one in Vacaville, which is like the closest one, sadly.
5979116	5983820	Yeah, I think they do, but it's just kind of... It's a sad shadow of its former self.
5983860	5984380	Exactly.
5984480	5989123	I mean, the next closest one's in Concord, or Pleasanton.
5990785	5991085	I don't know.
5992489	5993150	VACAVILLE NUT TREE
6016894	6017955	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6036553	6037073	Thanks for watching!
6052960	6076572	and the it was six six cents was the um company that made the original stuff it's uh 20 new test chambers that you can play and i guess they have new cubes that you can you know adjust the size of and you can also move portals around stuff and rotate objects using the move controller that might be fun i have portal too and i do have a move that i'm not using so maybe maybe
6078544	6079045	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6097784	6107438	I mean, a lot of people are waiting for the PlayStation debut of the original Mass Effect, which of course will be in the trilogy, or you'll also be able to get it on the PlayStation Network.
6107659	6108360	It's going to set you back $15.
6108620	6111364	There's also... Excuse me.
6113107	6113648	Oh, sneezing.
6113708	6114649	Radio guy's worst enemy.
6115991	6119374	There's also some detail on the DLC that's going to be included with the trilogy.
6120175	6122578	All the Cerberus Network with Mass Effect 2, of course.
6123259	6129126	On the PlayStation 3, though, you're going to get Lair of the Shadow Broker, Kasumi, which is what you need most of all.
6130407	6131048	And Overlord.
6131728	6132428	Do you get Zaid?
6132728	6134669	It doesn't say Zaid, and it doesn't say Arrival.
6135429	6136989	So you don't get all of the PlayStation 3.
6137049	6140230	Arrival was really necessary to the story, I think.
6140250	6142470	Well, if they can get another ten bucks out of you, though.
6142790	6145751	Mass Effect 3 will have Cerberus Network, but not Leviathan.
6146511	6151692	But I'm assuming it will have the multiplayer and all that good stuff, so that's one of the best features that keeps it going.
6152212	6152792	So there you go.
6153452	6154772	December 4th on the PlayStation 3.
6155272	6157453	And I kind of want it.
6158713	6161435	Just because I have the entire trilogy on 360.
6161795	6163296	I have the entire trilogy on PC.
6163396	6168300	I think I kind of owe it to myself to get the entire trilogy on PlayStation as well.
6168340	6169280	Don't you agree, Loki?
6169620	6170581	Don't you get my logic?
6170721	6171562	Don't you understand me?
6171802	6171942	Nope.
6175287	6177448	There's a Wreck-It Ralph iOS game.
6177509	6180510	If you were a fan of the movie, maybe you'll be a fan of the iOS game.
6180691	6184993	It includes Fix-It Felix Jr., which is the game that the movie's about.
6185294	6187075	I do want to point out, though, Fix-It Felix Jr.
6187095	6189096	is also a standalone app for free.
6189797	6193619	This other app is 99 cents, and you can also get Sweet Climber.
6194820	6197462	It's just inspired by Sugar Rush, but it's not a racing game.
6197522	6199083	It's a bounce-up-the-game.
6199763	6200204	Unless...
6221913	6224315	I don't know if it has arcade support because it's a twin stick shooter.
6225716	6229258	There's also, I'll tell you, I downloaded it because it's only 99 cents.
6229278	6229659	What the hell?
6229679	6230339	And I love the movie.
6231060	6236123	There is also apparently Turbo Time is a game that's coming, but it's locked right now.
6236163	6237124	It says coming soon.
6237244	6239946	So there will be, it looks like a fourth game added into it.
6240806	6243848	Pretty cool if you're a fan of Wreck-It Ralph, the iOS games out there right now.
6245008	6250571	There was a wedding in gaming this week, and this is a pretty good one for the gaming industry.
6251371	6255493	John Romero and Brenda Brathwaite actually got married.
6255533	6258755	This is actually last weekend, but just the news came out this week.
6259575	6260076	Get this.
6260776	6267399	Between the two of them, Doom, Wizardry, Quake, Commander Keen, Jagged Alliance, Wolfenstein 3D.
6268920	6275563	Maybe this is why, wasn't she one of the two people behind that Kickstarter for the old school RPG or something like that?
6276223	6277544	I can't remember.
6278064	6280785	I think she was, and maybe that's why they closed down.
6280825	6282486	Her name came up on the show recently.
6282626	6286627	Yeah, maybe that's why they closed down the whole Kickstarter for that.
6286728	6291850	Well, they also established a social game studio together in 2010.
6291990	6294871	Loot Drop was the studio that they co-founded together.
6295852	6301515	They were married by id Software co-founder Tom Hall, which is pretty cute.
6302556	6304938	And get this, DarkSakura, guess where they were married?
6306439	6307760	Disneyland on the steamboat.
6311562	6315625	And then for their honeymoon, they went to hell and killed demons.
6315945	6316386	Just kidding.
6316406	6316946	And it was fun.
6317166	6317767	And it was fun.
6318547	6319528	All right, let's move on.
6320048	6320929	DarkSakura, what do you have for us?
6321334	6322255	Some stuff.
6323115	6323656	Things.
6324196	6326738	How about some Ragnarok stuff?
6327698	6332301	The developer for Ragnarok is working, and that's... God, I hate when my screen messes up like this.
6332842	6339206	That's Kazuki Morishita, I believe, is working on a Nintendo 3DS title.
6339806	6343929	They're not saying what it's going to be, but he works on Ragnarok, so hey.
6345009	6345850	Maybe it's more Ragnarok.
6347285	6354032	Then, in more news, Treasure is working on a Nintendo 3DS exclusive.
6354852	6357735	So you know if Treasure's behind it, it's going to be fucking weird.
6358616	6359116	And pretty good.
6360277	6360738	Weird and good.
6360758	6361499	I mean, they did Gunstar Heroes.
6361519	6362520	Fucking weird, but pretty good.
6362800	6362980	Yeah.
6363500	6366023	I don't think Treasure's ever put out any crap, so...
6369156	6380047	And then... Cypress Hills Shag loses $250 million at the Grand Theft Auto lawsuit.
6381108	6381648	Basically...
6383792	6391015	He said that his likeness and life story was used to create the character CJ in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
6392255	6394176	And the judge said, no.
6395076	6395916	Sorry, you lose.
6396497	6397217	Do not pass, go.
6397677	6398897	Lose $250 million.
6399077	6401418	I don't think he lost $250 million.
6401438	6402499	He lost the ability to win.
6402519	6406520	He didn't win $250 million, but you can't lose what you didn't get.
6406540	6407320	Do not pass, go.
6407340	6408081	Do not collect $250 million.
6408361	6409921	Well, that and he had to pay for his court costs.
6410421	6411222	So he's probably out something.
6411442	6412082	He's out something.
6413519	6414180	and you know what I say?
6415823	6418488	That whole lawsuit was insane in the membrane.
6419990	6420531	Womp womp.
6421413	6422194	Okay, that's it.
6422374	6422775	Oh, that's it?
6422815	6423036	Alright.
6423416	6425740	Let's go to the Fugle Question of the Week.
6434082	6438664	Take the words Facebook and Google as in plus and slam them together and you get Fugle.
6438704	6440084	And that's where this segment comes from.
6440144	6443906	It's where we ask our fan communities a question and get their answers.
6444566	6449208	And, of course, since everybody's talking about the movies, we had to make the Fugle question about Wreck-It Ralph.
6449688	6454050	If the box office numbers are any indication, it looks like many of you saw Wreck-It Ralph this weekend.
6454070	6455030	What did you think of the movie?
6455511	6458592	Was it a great thing for video games or were you not happy with the way things were done?
6459472	6462013	Actdeft starts us off on Google Plus saying, I loved it.
6462113	6463214	Everything about it was great.
6463574	6465555	The story, the cameos, the jokes, everything.
6465695	6467356	Anyone who hasn't seen this movie should do so.
6467456	6467916	It's great.
6467976	6469717	It truly surpasses the Disney standards.
6470277	6471777	Was it a great thing for video games?
6472098	6479961	That I really do not know since the movie only has references to games and such, but it isn't a real video game movie like Silent Hill, for example.
6480421	6482822	It's just a story set in a video game universe.
6483203	6488085	But maybe it'll get people interested in retro gaming since most of the references are really from the old days of gaming.
6489486	6493349	Elliot B answers the question on Google and says, I was really excited about seeing it.
6493389	6494330	The trailer looked great.
6494871	6498834	Then I realized it's not out until February here in the UK.
6498914	6501537	Here's something that I want to just pose a question.
6501657	6504640	Do you think there are kids growing up nowadays that don't know what an arcade is?
6506502	6522987	you know one thing I will fault the movie for is that it was a little you did have to suspend disbelief that people were lining up at the arcade to get in when they'd open it in the morning and that it was as full as it looked because you and I and she all know that arcades don't look like that anymore unfortunately unless there's a water park attached
6523539	6524119	Yeah, right.
6524660	6528682	So that you did have to suspend disbelief for a little bit.
6528762	6531303	But are there kids growing up today that don't know what an arcade is?
6532084	6536046	No, because kids still have birthday parties at Chuck E. Cheese and Dave and Buster, well, or whatever.
6536586	6537587	All those types of places.
6538247	6540328	Bounce houses have arcades in them.
6540468	6541489	It's all ticket redemption.
6542029	6546851	You have a few arcade games in there, but most of it's Ticket Redemption.
6546931	6548172	Disneyland still has arcades.
6549092	6561258	There's arcades around, but it's just a lot of them tend to be the dollar experiences and they're driving games or gun games or whatever.
6561338	6564639	Just very few of the Fix-It Felix Jr.
6564840	6568481	type of games, which clearly was inspired by Donkey Kong and that type of stuff.
6568581	6569862	That type of experience...
6570402	6575663	doesn't really exist anymore except maybe in the corner to get little use out of those old games.
6577944	6580424	So Elliot wants to know he went and saw Skyfall instead.
6581044	6584725	Now see, Skyfall is not here until this week and I really want to see it.
6586226	6587746	Dan's been pissing himself over it.
6587826	6591567	I actually really like James Bond movies so I'm kind of excited about Skyfall.
6591607	6592587	And Craig is pretty...
6593286	6594026	He's a great Bond.
6594166	6594626	He's great.
6594846	6595646	I love his eyes.
6596587	6598127	He'll be even better as Indiana Jones.
6599987	6602068	Next up, E3VL.
6602428	6604808	I'm guessing that's Evel on Google+.
6604988	6609409	Loved the video game nostalgia, especially those happening in the background and emotional spikes.
6609909	6612089	This film was like the Roger Rabbit of video games.
6612509	6618170	Seems like the movie panders way too much to the old gen gamers, 20 plus years old, with the video game references.
6618550	6622271	Younger audiences may feel bored if it weren't for the sugar rush game and level puns.
6622991	6630356	If you bring your kids, prepare for them to be confused and saddened in certain segments and jump for joy after wiped tears as its problems are resolved.
6631116	6637140	Again, without spoiling too much though, the sugar rush thing kind of made up the majority of the movie.
6637300	6642504	So I don't think kids, I don't think the references would be, I mean there's a lot of references that are going to go over the kids' heads.
6642864	6647767	Like in the baddie video game, which is in the trailer, I'm not spoiling anything.
6648027	6661900	The Little League of Villains Batty Recovery Group Like, kids will just get that they're villains They'll get Zunkief They'll get Bison Maybe But they're not I think they'll get Pac-Man as well Why did
6663121	6668227	Why did... There's a very obvious reference to Kano from Mortal Kombat.
6668348	6669149	That is Kano.
6669209	6669569	Yeah, I know.
6669609	6670951	A very, very obvious reference.
6671271	6672673	And I don't think kids are going to get it.
6672753	6674375	The zombie is from House of the Dead.
6674415	6675737	Yeah, but adults get it.
6675837	6677659	And you know who the purple rhino was?
6678320	6679301	The embossed Maldred Beast.
6680202	6681524	With the fancy unicorns.
6681860	6683642	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6702697	6704979	Alright, let's go to Facebook because we had some good answers on Facebook.
6725800	6752786	I agree and I don't agree with you I think there's the potential to do other movies in this universe that's been established but I kind of draw the line at the Captain N thing remember, Mario's not in this movie because if Mario had been in the movie it would have been about Mario and the movie's not about the existing video game characters all the existing video game characters play supporting roles and that's what's really cool about it but Nintendo, a Captain N video game would be pretty awesome
6753286	6755708	No, Captain N was absolute shit.
6756309	6759372	Well, they could fix all the wrongs, you know, all the 80s weird stuff.
6759392	6761734	I mean, like Simon Belmont being all weird and stuff.
6761774	6764056	But if they fix all that, it could be pretty cool.
6764476	6766238	Xenocorn, our chatroom, agrees with you, by the way.
6766458	6767519	Live.VogNetwork.com.
6767559	6769401	He says, Captain N, the hell you say.
6769461	6770642	We can do better than Captain N.
6771050	6771891	Mega high.
6773352	6778815	Osfer says, honestly, I think Wreck-It Ralph did do well due to it being a Pixar film.
6779295	6780556	Ah, I got fooled, buddy.
6780596	6781216	He got fooled.
6781537	6782877	It looks like a Pixar film.
6782917	6783238	It was.
6783638	6784559	Look at the opening.
6784619	6786200	It's the Disney Classic Studio.
6786400	6790042	But it did have the Pixar logo right at the top.
6790943	6807286	And it was produced by Lasseter It was produced by one of the Pixar guys Although technically it's in the same This is the same studio that did Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and more recently Tangled Which is a very similar film, also not Pixar But it was produced by Lasseter
6807426	6808146	Right, so.
6808746	6815288	I mean, it's just, you know, this is where Disney, having bought Pixar, this is where you're really starting to see the fruits of them coming together.
6815608	6821149	But Brave was the Pixar film from this year, and Monsters 3, Monsters U or whatever is their big movie next year.
6822770	6827431	And I think the next Disney movie, the Disney classic movie next year is The Frozen.
6827511	6827751	Yeah.
6827791	6828511	Right, so.
6829672	6845789	Anyhow, continuing on with Osfer's comment I'm not calling you out or anything I'm just saying you made a mistake a lot of people are making And Pixar movies are great Maybe that was intentional There really is not a bad Pixar movie Unless it was a sequel to a mediocre one
6846449	6852050	Alright, those are usually the most hyped up films and it's rare to turn on the TV without seeing an ad for the movie.
6852491	6856612	It's my opinion that the movie that truly did well for video games went overlooked.
6857112	6864914	Silent Hill Revelation was the closest video game to film adaptation I've ever seen and future video game related movies could learn from it.
6865194	6865834	Which reminds me.
6866194	6867014	We still need to go see it.
6867834	6869095	I have another friend that wants to see it too.
6869475	6869755	Okay.
6870015	6870215	So...
6870976	6872317	We'll try to make that happen this week.
6872837	6876678	Yeah, I can't really respond to that because I haven't seen Silent Hill Revelation still.
6877419	6878179	It's on my radar.
6878219	6879600	I want to get that seen this week.
6880440	6882661	So I'll have to come back to that next week.
6884708	6896480	I would have seen it if I had power, but wanted to wonder if anyone else noticed how some reviewers were comparing this to Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and that you saw multiple characters from different franchises in the same movie.
6896860	6905149	You know, I didn't think I liked that comparison at first, but now I think I do, because again, in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, none of those characters were the star.
6906090	6908152	Roger Rabbit, Eddie, and Jessica Rabbit
6924306	6928469	Alright, moving on to DarkCharger who says, I saw this with my young son yesterday.
6928949	6931530	It's a great video game movie and a good movie overall.
6931911	6941396	While it doesn't belong in the pantheon of animated films, it is a great love letter to every sort of gamer, especially to those that live through the golden age of the arcade who may enjoy this film even more.
6941977	6948581	I think that it drives strength in its narrative by not simply focusing on video games, but by not forgetting about the characters.
6949021	6949701	It's a pretty good review.
6951212	6952973	Chiggers replied and said, I really liked Wreck-It Ralph.
6953033	6957917	My only complaint is that I wish they would have had more of the other classic game characters had more of a role.
6958037	6961099	I respect their decision to not do that because I think it would have taken away...
6978171	6993105	it was very interesting to me that one of the media supporting roles went to and again I don't think this is spoiling anything I think I'm okay saying this one of the media supporting roles went to Qbert because Qbert's one of those characters where it's like he's not
6994289	7003283	A Mario or a Sonic per se, but he's very recognizable if you were alive in the 80s or if you have a knowledge of 80s gaming.
7003624	7004165	You know what I mean?
7004725	7009092	Like, did you kind of feel that way, Jamie, that that was a very interesting character to have be a supporting character?
7009313	7009473	Yeah.
7010494	7011014	But it worked.
7011955	7013136	So, anyhow.
7015077	7016158	Let's see, moving on.
7016538	7017319	TheRobD says,
7030089	7037070	As a lifelong gamer, I find it refreshing to see them treated as the creative medium and source of enjoyment for so many that they are.
7037490	7040291	Not something that only nerds and basement dwellers partake in.
7040891	7042371	For me, the bottom line is this.
7042791	7046112	Wreck-It Ralph treats both video games and gamers with respect.
7046492	7052473	The people who created it did a wonderful job of capturing the joy of games and the world's Wii gamers experience.
7052793	7056074	This is the first time that's ever happened and they should be lauded for it.
7056514	7059436	Let's hope that this is the start of a trend and not an aberration.
7059836	7061737	That's a very solid comment.
7061757	7062277	I like that.
7063758	7065779	One more comment here from Degenerate Johnny.
7066539	7068240	This is also a very interesting comment.
7068260	7073102	I like this one a lot, and this is the last one I'm going to read here from Facebook.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
7073723	7081126	Degenerate Johnny says, I will admit that the movie was quite entertaining, and I think that it places video games in a better light, which is something the industry needs.
7081547	7085669	However, I'm not sure if Wreck-It Ralph is a good thing for the progression of video games.
7086229	7092191	The industry has grown up considerably since its inception, but it is still considered by many media outlets i.e.
7092271	7094851	Fox News and CNN as a child's toy.
7095512	7103274	Therefore, having a successful family-friendly video game movie may be a form of support to those who heavily criticize the industry for its violent games.
7103914	7110015	Interactive entertainment is the entertainment of this age, as was motion pictures the entertainment of the industrial age.
7110675	7117316	Honestly, I don't think that it's fair to interpret an entertainment industry based on its interactions with other forms of entertainment.
7118016	7124357	We don't interpret William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet through that horrid excuse of a movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio.
7124698	7127638	The views and opinions of OLR's fans do not reflect that of OLR.
7127938	7128738	Damn right they don't.
7128778	7129518	I love that movie.
7129778	7130298	I'm sorry.
7130499	7133099	I hate that play so much because they're both stupid.
7133738	7136580	I do agree there's better Shakespeare plays than Romeo and Juliet, for sure.
7136800	7137040	Really?
7137081	7137681	The theme of that?
7138001	7138822	Hi, we're stupid.
7138842	7139442	Let's kill each other.
7139562	7139943	The end.
7140843	7149790	Wreck-It Ralph was simply a fun-filled children's movie that I hope to God will only be viewed as such if interactive entertainment is to be accepted as the next form of entertainment.
7150510	7154793	I thought that was a very interesting comment because of the whole... And this is the part that really got me.
7155474	7161118	I don't think it's fair to interpret an entertainment industry based on its interactions with other forms of entertainment.
7161778	7163019	What do you think about that statement?
7163239	7165020	Do you think that's a good statement that he's making there?
7166280	7177686	It does seem like gamers, especially in gaming blogs and the things we read on the internet, it does seem like gamers are really obsessed with how does the news report on us?
7178167	7180248	How do we get portrayed in movies?
7180868	7184430	It does seem like that always piques a curiosity.
7184990	7186791	I just thought it was a neat way of looking at it.
7186831	7186891	Hmm.
7207992	7211173	It's very kind of, it actually strikes me as somewhat abstract.
7212173	7212393	Yeah?
7212553	7230338	I mean, if you look at taking one genre and portraying it in another genre, then any type of biography about artists, about, shoot, toy story, toys coming to life and doing stuff.
7231974	7232655	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7250051	7254114	because silent movies were way different than movies today.
7254174	7263100	Hell, even when there was silent movies, you needed the piano guy sitting there at the front playing, you know, those two industries have always really needed each other.
7263740	7266482	And some of the best music was inspired by movies.
7267263	7272747	Or have you, well, music just goes with some, like, here's going to be a really dumb example.
7273267	7275428	Have you ever written California Screamin' without the soundtrack?
7276309	7277630	Yeah, when my chair was broken.
7278706	7280027	Was it not a little different?
7280107	7281207	It was not as good.
7281467	7281728	Yeah.
7282388	7284969	Or changing the music and things.
7285089	7292773	That's why I really like how a lot of times for showing a suspenseful part in a movie or a game, they'll just use silence.
7293814	7301578	Instead of, they'll let you focus on the sounds going on, not just scary music to let you know it's scary.
7301598	7301998	Yeah.
7304340	7308364	And of course, we'll end it on this comment in the chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
7308745	7312289	Xenacore says, Rob, the answer to your question is porn.
7313570	7316934	Robert M. also says that there are a lot of classic toys in Toy Story.
7318976	7320217	You know, what about...
7323633	7323973	Books.
7324673	7326354	I mean, we've kind of had The NeverEnding Story.
7326834	7328195	What was that, The Pagemaster?
7328455	7330716	I mean, people were into that movie.
7330896	7332317	I hate to say it.
7333097	7337699	Or even take comics.
7337919	7341160	Take a different genre of story.
7341260	7342681	For example, the whole Fable series.
7343459	7345521	Actually, you just really hit on something.
7345541	7352567	Because something that's really huge now that wasn't as big years ago was the comics and movies.
7352947	7354648	That's a huge thing in the industry now.
7354768	7366278	And really, before the past few years, you would occasionally have Superman was huge in the 70s, and Batman was huge in the 90s, the Burton series.
7366658	7370321	But comics are kind of big in movies now in a way where...
7370501	7398994	We haven't seen I have a reason to see Guardians of the Galaxy now Rocket Raccoon Anyway The whole reason I think with that and also why I think Wreck-It Ralph is doing well is that the audience the target audience being also the same age group of an audience that's going to have the money and maybe have kids but also be the people who are going to get it That's the ones you want to market to is our age demographic
7400498	7407651	and on top of that, we grew up I grew up reading X-Men and Avengers, you know I didn't read DC because DC sucks
7410138	7439570	um sorry my allergies my sinus infection is getting the best of me um but uh you know we grew up playing these games it's we are at the age that we are the ones with money and the influence not in the corporate world of course because that's bullshit Occupy um but uh as far as what dictates what's popular in pop culture in in modern popular culture we're the age group
7441431	7444053	There are too many deep discussions happening on tonight's show.
7444093	7444894	I don't understand.
7444934	7445975	What is in the air tonight?
7446035	7448217	Where am I taking fart jokes that I came here for?
7448237	7448797	I don't get it.
7449418	7449758	Don't worry.
7450058	7451840	My next story has raccoon penis in it.
7451980	7452280	Okay.
7452821	7453101	Phew.
7453221	7455663	Well, before we get to your story, then we got to do a couple more.
7455723	7456904	So let's get back into some news.
7457024	7461368	Loki, we will be opening up the Skype line later if you want to call and voice your opinion on any of this.
7461388	7465371	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
7465611	7466052	Sorry, Loki.
7466092	7467573	I needed to plug that before we get to that.
7467853	7469194	Not a problem.
7469274	7483304	Since a lot of the whole online plan for the Wii U has been kind of non-existent or hidden or secret or whatever, it is kind of refreshing to see that there's some information, including now what their web browser is going to be.
7483364	7487967	I don't know if there's anything to really be excited about, but here we go.
7488628	7496333	Basically, it's based off the whole NetFront browser, which has been used in pretty much all the portable gaming systems.
7496713	7496914	The
7497614	7510608	DS, 3DS, PSP, Vita, and of course, you know, the Wii U. It's based a little bit off of, you know, they've got Mozilla kind of backing a little bit of the Apple WebKit as well.
7511389	7516134	And then a little bit of, I guess, the Nintendo browser, which is good or bad.
7516955	7523104	It will support HTML5, of course, no Flash, because everyone's kind of saying HTML5 is the way to go anyways.
7524025	7529834	Because if we had Flash, we'd be able to play all of those virtual console games for free, and Nintendo has to know this.
7530415	7531196	They have to know this.
7531316	7531997	Of course, of course.
7534059	7538582	It's going to support MP4 files as well as live streaming.
7540644	7546108	MPEG-4 AVC video, the H.2.64 format.
7546288	7547909	Although some may not be playable.
7548009	7552913	And of course, it will support just the regular level HTML4, 5...
7555014	7563597	X, HTML 1.1, CSS 1, 2, or 2.1 and 3, although those are partially functioning, like S3 is partially functioning.
7564417	7573660	And they say even like video web storage is partially functioning, web messaging and some other stuff there.
7576332	7579933	No plugins, obviously, because it's built into the system there.
7580734	7588298	And I guess they're saying that the browser will support some touch event stuff, like a touch start, touch end, move, cancel.
7588518	7590799	I'm assuming it's all the stuff that you would have with a touch patch.
7590899	7591660	Here's the thing.
7591920	7595643	Will it be fast and responsive and easy?
7595744	7602009	Because the problem with so many of these browsers on the TV and all this stuff is that they run like shit.
7602390	7605513	It's faster to just whip my phone out of my pocket and get what I need.
7605653	7608936	Well, they're saying right now that it's supposed to be, I guess...
7610797	7628382	It does support HTML5, and I guess because it renders HTML5 websites more effectively than any other console, even faster than Internet Explorer, they're saying that it's pretty good, I guess?
7629282	7629562	Html5 Test
7653660	7655481	They have a gaming tab on there.
7656061	7661543	Right now, there's not a lot of gaming browsers that support HTML5.
7662184	7664065	The 3DS and Xbox 360.
7664165	7664845	The 3DS got a 109.
7665025	7667166	The Xbox 360 is a 120.
7667306	7671007	And then, of course, the other browsers right now.
7671027	7672788	I guess Wii does support it a little bit.
7673028	7674349	Wii's got a 94 and the DSi a 94.
7674489	7675389	And the Vita, a 58.
7681400	7706288	in the course right now they're saying although it lists the Vita again I guess for HTML5 maybe that's like HTML4 scores or something like that but for in the future or in development the Wii U a 323 and I guess the Vita is a 243 I'm assuming that's maybe an update or something so I don't know like I said where they're getting their information as far as how they're scoring that but
7708977	7710218	Interesting, I guess.
7711299	7715542	I'm trying to see if there's any other comparisons with tablets.
7715622	7717704	Okay, so let's look at tablets real quick.
7718464	7721586	And as you would expect, the tablets are better.
7722727	7724709	The 323 is the Wii U's benchmark there.
7725489	7729272	And right now, they have Opera Mobile 12.
7729532	7729752	That's a 406.
7730633	7731133	And Chrome's 390.
7731173	7736217	I'm trying to see what else would be the closest there.
7737618	7761797	Even Windows Phone 8 is close, 320, iOS 6 is a 386, Firefox Mobile, 388 So it does sound like your phone is going to be better at rendering those pages But it's not as bad, even TVs are better at it But for gaming, out of gaming consoles, it is the best
7762848	7772957	I don't know if that's really saying much, but when I can get my hands on it and try it, that's when I can't really say one way or the other.
7773677	7775619	I don't even know where they're getting it.
7775659	7778621	It doesn't say what they're testing.
7778681	7785087	I don't really know what they're testing and how they're even testing a system that's not out yet.
7786678	7791879	All right, I have some potpourri news involving Nintendo, and it means I have a few little things I want to get out here.
7792879	7798241	One of them is about finally some details on what exactly the Nintendo Network Premium involves.
7799041	7805542	You remember the Wii U Deluxe Edition that has Nintendo Land as a packing game also gets this whole Nintendo Network Premium.
7805602	7807083	So what the hell is this all about?
7807143	7813004	Well, basically, you get 10% back in points that you spend on the Wii U shop.
7813604	7827548	so if you get the 32 gig Wii U with the game you get Nintendo Network Premium and you get 10% back in points if you buy a Wii U game on the eShop so let's say you buy a game for $59.99 10% of that's $5.99 points so there you go you get $5 in eShop credit for every 500 points
7833209	7842017	So basically buying a game like New Super Mario Bros.
7842577	7848582	Wii U online would get you enough points to buy the original Mario Bros.
7848622	7852826	on the virtual console So a little something there
7853326	7862561	It's very similar to what the Vita does already, where you get 10% off, but that 10% that you save is not tied to their store.
7862781	7868009	It's just money in your pocket versus having this money be...
7868690	7871774	Honestly, I don't see downloading games as kind of an option.
7871854	7872976	I don't know.
7873656	7880244	With how fickle I get with games and stuff like that, you would want to have the option to sell it back or something.
7880705	7883989	There's not really much of an incentive, I guess.
7884009	7884690	Yeah.
7884870	7885291	Super Mario Bros.
7885331	7885931	U Challenge Mode
7902829	7908790	There's categories that include time attack, coin collection, one-up rally, and special, which is basically miscellaneous.
7909190	7912471	There's also boost mode challenges that will require two players.
7912971	7916612	Once you complete a challenge, a replay is saved so you can show that off.
7917012	7925274	There's also coin battle, where up to four players will go through the course and see who can collect the most coins, not unlike the recent 3DS release.
7926414	7955243	another player can use the Wii U gamepad in boost mode to place boost blocks to help grab a hard to reach coin you can use the gamepad to edit and customize the coin layout in dedicated courses that layout can then be saved and played by players using the Wii remote controllers at least that sounds kind of new and interesting I'm curious how that plays out coins everywhere world map
7956345	7956605	NABBIT
7972646	7980633	A creature named Nabbit from time to time will appear on the world map if you enter the course and catch Nabbit to recover items stolen from Toad.
7981393	7986738	If you get Nabbit, you get a pea acorn which will allow you to fly continuously through an entire stage.
7986758	7990161	I'm assuming that is like the pea wing from Mario 3.
7993123	8000769	And one other thing, you know, Loki, you give Nintendo a lot of shit on this show, but you gotta applaud Nintendo for this comment this week.
8001810	8015175	Satoru Iwata in talking about Animal Crossing New Leaf on the Nintendo 3DS mentioning all of the download content will be free because charging consumers for the DLC would not be cool.
8015255	8020437	Quote, that sort of element, paid DLC, is absolutely not being added.
8020777	8023098	He went so far as to call it unwholesome.
8023638	8028600	So basically like, you know, they could have charged for new patterns and silly, they're not going to do it.
8030020	8033242	They thought about it, but they decided not to do it.
8034143	8036805	Loki, Nintendo's biggest critic on this show.
8037768	8063984	wasn't that the right call to make well yeah it's the the most common sense call to make and let's be honest the first party companies aren't really the ones that are being known for all this on disc content I don't think that Sony has a whole lot of games that kind of nickel and dime you for things and I don't think that Microsoft has any any similar games like that as well so cool you're on equal standing with everybody else third party companies well that's
8064284	8064844	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8083160	8085442	What does raccoon penis have to do with video games?
8086122	8093027	It actually has to do with a digital art group called Massive Black.
8093887	8101572	And they've done a lot of concept art for Lord of the Rings Online, Infamous 2, Silent Hill Shattered Memories, and Transformers 3.
8102933	8105835	They also developed their own game.
8105875	8112960	They have an artistic demo out called Moth Head that they're using to show the Unity platform.
8114421	8118423	I downloaded this because honestly I had heard of the art piece that it was based off of.
8119123	8131709	It's based off of a sculpture that is, well, it has a giant phallus on it made from the real bone of a raccoon penis.
8133129	8136891	And if no one believes me, I will pull up the image and show everybody.
8137171	8138072	Oh, no, no, I believe you.
8138132	8138472	It's fine.
8139592	8140413	and DarkSakura.com.
8166988	8194837	it's actually supposed to be similar to and I'm going to mispronounce this as Botanicula I think it's still a demo I mean the controls aren't great I downloaded it it was originally conceived as a full length game and they still want to do it but right now it's sort of on hold while they finish their clients work because they still have huge groups that they're doing artwork for but
8196511	8198052	It's absolutely gorgeous to me.
8198132	8201495	I mean, I freaking love concept art.
8202276	8209781	And just the fact that they would take this sculpture and turn it into a figure in a game just to sort of like combining two of my favorite things.
8210422	8213124	You know, fine modern art and video games.
8213204	8217347	I'll post the link of the image in the chat room.
8219049	8219369	Alright.
8221130	8221831	Let's move on, Loki.
8221851	8221931	Okay.
8222589	8234094	Alright, so, I don't know, we talked about, we talked a lot about a recent video, I don't even really call it a video game movie, but a video game based movie.
8235935	8243279	Let's talk about another one that probably won't turn out as well, and that would be Castle Wolfenstein, the movie.
8244379	8249982	Apparently, they've got Roger Avery back on his role as the writer and director for the movie.
8250642	8252744	Doom Level Skip
8274648	8274988	I don't know.
8276210	8279032	But anyways, their plot, if we must go back in there.
8279413	8280454	A young U.S.
8280754	8291424	Army captain and British special agent are on a top secret mission to Castle Wolfenstein where Hitler will be unveiling a new secret weapon.
8292986	8293987	That sounds awfully generic.
8294067	8297430	Does this mean the Hitler robot that was the boss of one of the... I hope so.
8297590	8297991	Oh boy.
8299710	8301732	It could be, I think it could be dumb fun.
8302252	8304154	As long as it we bowls not attached to it, which he is.
8304234	8305295	Emphasis on dumb.
8306637	8307117	Yeah.
8308378	8310280	All right, well, I think this is kind of neat.
8310380	8316786	Now, you know, Sega is no stranger to repackaging their old shit, and they've done it a lot, a lot.
8317427	8325735	And, you know, the various collections, whether it be download, PC, or these little hook them up directly to your TV things, right?
8327135	8329156	There's a new one on the way out.
8329236	8332377	It's called the Sega Genesis Ultimate Portable Game Player.
8332878	8334638	And it's coming out November 13th.
8334698	8335779	It's going to cost $59.99.
8336419	8341201	That's $60 for a Genesis, but it has 80 games built in.
8341221	8342541	That looks vaguely like a Nomad.
8344142	8345662	37 of them are going to be from Sega.
8346263	8346643	Oh, I'm sorry.
8347203	8349444	Is this one that you plug into your TV?
8349524	8351065	No, it looks like a portable system, doesn't it?
8351085	8351665	It might be both.
8351945	8352745	It could be both.
8352765	8354806	You could do it with the Nomad.
8355839	8358661	Yeah, I'm trying to see real quick if that... I'm not sure.
8358761	8366145	Anyway, there's 37 of these games from Sega, 3 from Capcom, and 40 from an assortment of other publishers.
8366586	8367286	Here's the thing.
8367506	8372669	One of those Capcom games that's going to be on this player, Mega Man The Wily Wars.
8373690	8384417	Now, if you don't know what this game is, it's remakes of the first three Mega Mans on the NES along with a game called Wily Tower, like a little mini-game.
8385057	8385900	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8391448	8393770	But how many people actually had the Sega Channel?
8394170	8397293	So most people missed this when it was first out.
8397333	8401817	So it's very interesting that all these years later, the Wily Wars is actually going to be out.
8401897	8405220	Now, I'm sure half you out there have already emulated this at this point.
8405320	8409103	But it's still worth saying that this is on its way out.
8409144	8411426	And who knows what other goodies could be in there.
8411466	8413527	The only way we know about this one is it's on the box.
8414128	8415489	So who knows what else is in there.
8415529	8417551	That's pretty awesome.
8418143	8419665	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8437083	8439465	It's a 2.8 inch LCD screen.
8439506	8440587	It's a handheld player.
8441027	8442448	Rechargeable battery built in.
8442568	8445151	USB cable included for charging battery.
8445171	8446713	It doesn't look like you can hook it up to the TV.
8446733	8448514	I still recommend Power Battle.
8450756	8451157	Never know.
8453482	8454663	Alright, so there you go.
8455884	8457985	Something new all these years later in the US.
8458786	8459827	Let's go to the email bag.
8459967	8464851	Every week we collect your emails at mailbag at orangelawnsradio.com All one of them?
8465231	8465791	All one of them.
8465811	8469794	So DarkSakura's going to dive into the email bag and say, hello, hello, hello.
8470275	8471295	And then she'll look on the ground.
8471455	8475338	Oh, one lone little email in here.
8475538	8477620	Let me just reach down here and pick it up.
8478761	8481623	And she'll read that one email on the air here tonight.
8482057	8482738	And here it is.
8483899	8488363	I see that the stores have Wreck-It Ralph toys, but only three characters in the first wave.
8488903	8491065	Ralph Fix-It Felix Jr.
8491526	8493407	and Ralph in the Hero's Duty armor.
8494248	8494588	Duty.
8495489	8499132	I understand why they can't flood the shelves with Bowser's, Clyde's, and Q-Bert's.
8499893	8501513	Who even holds that license now?
8501713	8507054	I know a New York holding company licenses the Gotlight pinball tables, but what about the arcade cabinet games?
8507555	8511555	But right now, more of the movie's original characters seem to be Disney Store only.
8512336	8516496	And just to ask Loki, seriously this time, you mentioned suffering from weekend headaches.
8517277	8520937	This is something affecting me as well, so what does your doctor think is causing it?
8521057	8522098	Allergies or stress, maybe?
8522118	8524098	I don't know, it'll go to my doctor.
8526081	8528183	I should show you the pillow that I use that got rid of most of my headaches.
8542910	8549334	Loki also gets a lot of stress caused by this show because he pops blood vessels every time a Nintendo story comes up.
8549394	8550194	Let's be real.
8550234	8551315	I've seen that eye twitch.
8552435	8560920	That comes from Robert M. The first part of the thing about the licensed toys, I think honestly that just would have cost Disney extra money.
8561200	8562961	Disney doesn't want to push...
8564162	8585718	other people's properties they want to push their own properties and remember and I don't know if you've actually seen the movie yet or what have you but remember the movie just uses all these licensed stuff to kind of get you into the plot that involves characters that are not based off of real games so of course Disney wants to build their own characters so you know
8586638	8587999	I think that's what it really boils down to.
8606752	8620440	I think everybody recognizes Road Blasters, but did Road Blasters really have that same financial impact and did it make that same kind of money that maybe other comparable racing games did, like Pole Position, per se?
8621040	8621640	Probably not.
8621740	8624042	Or Iron Man, Off-Road, Stewart, that whole thing?
8624362	8626123	Probably not, but everybody recognizes it.
8626403	8627064	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8652282	8655304	I think there is an actual DDR machine in the movie.
8655344	8655645	It is.
8655805	8656205	Yeah, there is.
8656305	8657986	There's an X2 machine.
8658126	8658667	Right at the start.
8658947	8666713	They licensed the likeness from Konami, I'm sure, but that probably cost them a hell of a lot less than licensing Simon Belmont would have cost, you know?
8667333	8669795	So, they're smart.
8672758	8680161	Robert M in chat says, and technically yes, but what I was saying was hopefully Vanilla Girl and Sergeant Calhoun will be later characters.
8680561	8681081	Oh, well, yes.
8681602	8683142	I hope they are too.
8683242	8685263	Vanilla P von Schweetz, is that what you're talking about?
8686483	8690885	You know, she also made me think of Penelope Pitstop because the name was similar.
8691872	8692813	Thanks for watching!
8711126	8712728	I thought that was a really good pick.
8712788	8715750	In fact, all the voice actors were really good.
8716270	8719973	Jane Lynch especially was a great choice for that character.
8720453	8721314	She was perfect.
8722034	8725096	And the 30 Rock guy as Fix-It Felix.
8725517	8727018	They were all very great, great picks.
8728291	8732032	Alright, since that's it for the emails, shame, shame.
8732072	8733872	Mailbag at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
8733892	8735613	Send us more emails to read next week.
8736033	8740814	In the meantime... And don't tell us about, you know, inheriting money from some guy in England.
8741094	8745855	Yes, or your, you know, pyramid scheme, or the French spam has to stop.
8747135	8747995	End French spam.
8749255	8749555	Alright.
8750216	8751876	Viva la French spam.
8753196	8756637	Alright, speaking of things that make us angsty like French spam...
8757558	8758492	It's time for the FUs of the week.
8774787	8787757	My FUs are, first of all, to the end of my sinus infection, to Origin, well, actually specifically, the patch for Mass Effect 3 and EA's customer service.
8788517	8791940	It's keeping me from being able to play my game without restriction.
8793001	8796403	And all of it's not cool, but really I can't play it at all.
8797785	8799786	Um, and, uh...
8801407	8804610	I had another one, but I'm distracted by Raccoon Penis.
8806152	8806572	Loki.
8807633	8821846	I guess just F you to... I'll F you to this whole week because we're in the whole crux of the fourth quarter stuff, and unfortunately in the position of...
8824130	8825191	Distribution.
8826272	8839541	See, Distribution right now, it seems like they don't get Call of Duty Black Ops 2 early enough so the independent stores get theirs before midnight launch, which pisses off everybody and keeps having those people ask,
8839961	8843062	How am I supposed to stay in business and compete against games?
8843522	8846203	It's like, listen, I'm not your fucking person that's supposed to tell you that.
8846223	8848143	If I told you that, I'd be running your store.
8848943	8850124	I'm not running your store.
8850244	8851984	I don't get paid enough to run your store.
8852364	8860747	You don't go up to, you know, you don't own a restaurant and go to your butcher or whatever and go, why can't I compete with these other restaurant chains?
8860967	8861727	It doesn't make any sense.
8862407	8863107	So it's annoying.
8863328	8869251	And on top of all that, the rest of my co-workers, sales staff, get to go to Napa for a fun three-day weekend.
8870352	8878116	But because I landlocked the wife, I do not get to go to Napa.
8878636	8880797	Not that I was enjoying that because it's all wine tasting.
8880877	8882257	I fucking hate wine.
8882717	8883337	I like wine.
8883437	8884337	No, I don't like wine.
8884497	8886138	See, I was excited about it because I was like, sweet.
8886358	8888598	Second day is usually kind of that whole fun.
8888658	8890399	You get to go do whatever you want.
8890519	8891979	Well, they have like activities planned out.
8892459	8895000	But now they only have one activity and that's wine tasting.
8895020	8896940	See, my activity would be fuck all the activities.
8897060	8900981	I'm driving to Menlo Park and I'm going to go to fucking Cusar.
8902261	8904502	But no, that's not going to happen.
8904562	8905122	So it's fine.
8907396	8908877	Um, I don't know.
8908977	8912498	I have general angst this week, but not things I can really put into words.
8912578	8913579	Just stuff and things.
8913799	8917320	So, F you to stuff and things.
8918381	8919141	That's all you get.
8920642	8930906	Alright, uh, let's move on to a few more quick news stories, and then we're gonna get to your calls at 1-877-GAME-OLR and Orange Lounge Radio, all one word, on Skype.
8930966	8932467	But first, two more stories for you.
8932527	8932747	Loki.
8932967	8933207	FISHVILLE
8953513	8955834	I mean, seriously, this whole Ville thing has got to stop.
8955874	8957855	I mean, it just sounds stupid.
8958416	8964939	But FishVille and Treasure Isle are the first two games that will be kind of going by.
8965580	8970403	And they're going to stop running on December 5th.
8971143	8976986	And I guess FishVille is a game where people fish?
8978387	8979067	Or are fish?
8979127	8980088	Imagine that!
8980168	8980748	I don't know, it's...
8982209	8983470	Who gives a fuck?
8983550	8984191	I don't care.
8984251	8985031	Yeah, I really don't.
8988554	8994879	But they do refer to their players as Fishvillers as this email from the Fishville team.
8996861	8997061	Hmm.
8998894	9000475	All right, one more story for you guys.
9000655	9003217	Here's one for the classic OLR fans.
9004577	9006839	DDR Classroom Edition.
9006999	9009820	There's some extra information coming out about DDR Classroom Edition.
9009860	9015043	That's right, that's kind of where DDR lives on now, is in PE programs in schools, which I think is great.
9016024	9018645	It's a great way to get kids involved in Dance Dance Revolution.
9019006	9021147	Here's the interesting thing about DDR Classroom Edition.
9021167	9023768	It's probably better than any other version of the game.
9025049	9025429	What?
9025449	9025669	What?
9048877	9052002	Apparently going to get new music updates every three to six months.
9052622	9059772	After some successful location tests in Southern California at some schools there, they're being very aggressive about the title.
9059852	9064118	Too bad it's something for schools and not for...
9066656	9068057	People to, like, actually get.
9068137	9079564	Well, here's the thing, though, is I think a lot of this stuff that they're probably licensing for the classroom edition is probably going to end up in Dance Dance Revolution, the fourth or fifth reboot of the franchise.
9079964	9080805	The new one coming out?
9080885	9083426	I think that'd be my guess, because they're doing too many licenses.
9083466	9089050	I doubt they would dump that much money into a classroom edition, which really doesn't need a diverse...
9089990	9095974	I mean, if you think about it, do you really need a diverse soundtrack for the classroom edition?
9096974	9109282	I mean, I'm assuming most of this stuff is going to be picked by the teacher in the class and no one's going to go, oh my goodness, I really want to hear that song by the Screaming Masks or...
9111922	9114364	There's a pink song, So What?
9114524	9115785	I've heard that song on the radio.
9116686	9123032	Natasha Bedingfield, Pocket Full of Sunshine, although I think, wasn't that in the DDR release on the most recent PlayStation?
9123192	9123573	I don't know.
9125975	9130179	Chris Brown's song, you know, because they really should encourage his stuff in schools.
9130840	9131140	Yeah.
9133243	9134764	That's a huge song list, though.
9135265	9137427	397 songs looking at the PDF.
9137667	9138968	I'm sure it ain't cheap.
9139568	9146854	The question is, and thankfully they have this totally not sorted by artist, is Holic in the game?
9148876	9149557	Is Holic in there?
9150177	9151098	Holic is not in there.
9151118	9152039	At least I don't see it.
9152139	9153340	Maybe future DLC.
9154140	9155121	Hot Limit, though, is.
9156722	9157043	Awesome.
9158140	9159421	You say Dramamine.
9160081	9160401	All right.
9161142	9161982	Let's go to the phones.
9162002	9165644	1-877-GAME-OLR or I use your name on Skype as Orange Lounge Radio.
9166124	9168566	The phones are now open.
9168946	9169686	You can give us a call.
9170227	9174409	I'm going to go to the Twitter topics, but I got to grab my iPad.
9174809	9177351	Loki, do you have any last minute stories?
9178071	9182173	No, I was just checking out some of the... Stop it.
9182714	9184715	I was just checking out some of the songs that are in here.
9184775	9186816	I was just seeing what they've got here and...
9188294	9189295	I'm sorry, I was asleep.
9190277	9194622	They really don't have this in any sort of order.
9195323	9197947	I'm trying to see if Holic is in here.
9198487	9199729	Holic is the best song ever.
9200169	9203313	They have Silent Hill, Thomas Howard for Christmas.
9203474	9203954	That's kind of cool.
9206590	9211374	Is that what happens in school now during the winter is like DDR time in PE?
9211394	9213295	No, I think that would be fucking awesome.
9214016	9219640	It would be really awesome to have that because it was what ultimate, it was like dodgeball or something like that.
9220441	9221502	What the hell did we used to do?
9221562	9222763	Play basketball maybe?
9222903	9223823	We used to do square dancing.
9223843	9224764	Yeah, we used to do square dancing.
9224784	9225765	Square dancing was the best.
9227546	9227987	You're weird.
9229808	9231630	It was the one thing I was good at.
9233248	9234168	Grab your partner.
9234188	9235349	That and Pickleball.
9235509	9236610	Did you guys ever play Pickleball?
9236670	9236910	No.
9237350	9238230	That was the other thing.
9238250	9242132	It was like tennis, but kind of like dumbed down a little bit.
9242312	9245274	We had a game that we would play that was called Sink the Bismarck.
9245994	9246254	What?
9247152	9249133	After the ship from the World War.
9250814	9259619	But basically, you had two sides, and you had a few students in the middle, and they were the water mines.
9260399	9263320	And so the students were all the ships crossing the ocean.
9264201	9272185	And if one of the land mines managed to touch, or not land mines, but the water mines managed to touch one of the other students, then they became a mine, and they had to stop where they were.
9272725	9274906	And until the last one left was the winner.
9275787	9275927	So...
9280110	9282092	I just remember every Friday we had to run the mile.
9283733	9284374	Let's see.
9284614	9289098	Going to Twitter topics at twitter.com slash OLR.
9290860	9292381	Thankfully, there's no let them move.
9293823	9295384	SSJ100 Matt linked us this story.
9295544	9300969	I thought this was in our show role, but I think it just might have not made this week.
9301030	9301350	I don't know.
9301630	9304113	Take two is going to be opening a new Las Vegas office.
9304413	9304574	Yeah.
9304594	9309039	I think that was one of the stories you posted that we just didn't get to tonight because you talked to Grand Theft Auto somewhere else.
9309459	9313984	But yeah, 150 jobs in Las Vegas, a brand new downtown office.
9314405	9319651	Las Vegas Redevelopment Agency is offering up $600,000 in incentives to take two if they open the branch.
9320912	9343966	I'm telling you man Vegas is a pretty awesome you mean because everyone really thinks that Vegas is kind of like ooh casinos and stuff like that but it's actually a pretty cool suburb with like really cheap housing and it's not bad if like you're not into the whole casino thing it's still like a nice suburb I'm not sure if everybody who lives there would agree with you but let's go to the it seemed like a nice suburb I don't know hi you're on orange launch radio who's this
9345061	9346964	Uh, a survivor of the hurricane, Ranma.
9347144	9349006	Hey, so you came out okay, huh?
9349607	9350488	Yeah, pretty much.
9350928	9356275	One of our studios, aka Joe Vigdea, she lost power for a few days, but other than that, came out pretty good.
9356495	9360080	Well, you know, a lot worse things could happen than losing power for a few days.
9360460	9361241	I'm glad to hear...
9362262	9369588	Places are recovering, you know, it's really tragic seeing a lot of the stuff that's happening along the New Jersey shore and all of that.
9369649	9380898	Like, all the jokes about reality TV aside, like, seeing that roller coaster just submerged in water is just, like, jaw on floor type of thing.
9380958	9384581	It's just, it's upsetting, but, you know...
9385442	9403390	I know, I'm seeing the photos of the train station that's right by my house and the one view a little bit down the way, seeing all that water had me spazzing and then like on Wednesday when they started saying you can take the train, you can take some of the buses, me and a couple of friends went down to Coney Island to survey some of the damage.
9403730	9407492	I saw the pictures, it didn't seem like it was that bad.
9408137	9408897	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9425523	9426164	Thanks for watching!
9447967	9452351	Yeah, pretty much, and now they're talking about another storm coming our way in about two days.
9452731	9453372	Oh, goody.
9453872	9458155	Well, that's why you're supposed to fill your bathtub with water, have bleach, get canned food, buy all the bread.
9459016	9459717	Tape your windows.
9461378	9465461	I did all of that, and we had a big ol' bucket of hurricane to drink.
9468124	9470666	But I will tell you, welcome to my childhood.
9471226	9474529	Ranma, I'm sure you didn't just call in to talk about the storm, but thank you for the update.
9475089	9475830	What's on your mind tonight?
9477343	9483669	My issues with Xbox and banning people for names and insults and stuff.
9483969	9486832	I mean, I kind of see both points on this.
9487172	9497001	It just feels like this is no different from being in high school and you're being bullied and you're hearing N-word, F-word, K-word, all this stuff.
9497262	9500064	And it's like, if you run your mouth, if you go...
9502725	9503505	Go report it.
9503565	9504126	This happens.
9504166	9504706	That happens.
9505226	9511929	In a way, I kind of feel like just let them handle their own business.
9512589	9521132	But on the same token, if it's just a bunch of friends running their mouth having a good time, you have that one person coming in, starting to freak out, and then all hell breaks loose.
9521353	9524414	Yeah, but if you're going to play with your friends, why would you let that one person in anyway?
9525254	9546507	Because, you know, it's always in that, in the group, it's like, you always bring that one person, like, oh, don't worry, he's cool, he's understandable, she's cool, she's understandable, and then you're like, and you find out later, oh, shit Or, back in the day when we'd do PSO and only three of us were online and we wanted a fourth to do the full challenge, we would just go to Open Lobby, the three of us, and pull another person
9546974	9547334	XBOX 360 XBOX 360
9564802	9570425	So like, you know, like Shane and I might be playing Mass Effect and maybe we have, you know, Acidic Vampire, Osfer, somebody with us.
9570745	9577048	So like the three of us will be in the party chat and then we'll bring in a random fourth, but they can't hear us because we're in the party chat.
9577509	9577989	That's good.
9578109	9579750	And that dialogue doesn't go out in game.
9579810	9582691	So, you know, we have to remember the Xbox does have that infrastructure set up.
9583011	9589715	So if you do want to bring in randoms to fill out your party, you know, you can still have your closed conversation without worrying about offending some stranger.
9589735	9589815	Yeah.
9591687	9592127	There we go.
9592588	9594089	Yeah, so that's a solution.
9594149	9598493	But I still get what you're saying, you know, where you don't want that one person.
9598513	9608721	Because still, you could be bringing somebody into your little party chat that maybe you kind of didn't estimate correctly and maybe will take offense.
9609142	9619891	But I think, I don't know, I guess Microsoft to some extent maybe has a responsibility to not regulate private games the same way they would regulate a public game.
9621332	9622273	That works for me Yep
9636275	9643001	although some would argue it's toxic to use those words in any circumstance, but that's a debate for another time, I suppose.
9643101	9645483	Yes, definitely.
9646043	9648185	So, gosh, anything else on your mind tonight, buddy?
9649086	9651407	A friend of mine did a voice in Wreck-It Ralph.
9652068	9652588	Oh, really?
9652729	9653229	What voice?
9653269	9653569	Do you know?
9654410	9655111	He was Ryu.
9656271	9657292	Get out!
9657833	9658814	That's awesome.
9660915	9663117	It was a quick scene, but it was funny.
9663457	9664158	Everybody laughed.
9665558	9666258	So will the Wii U launch?
9691434	9702283	We need stories from the Wii U launch I don't know what's going on here Everything about this launch is very mysterious to me It seems like it's all done in pre-orders Are people even camping out?
9702343	9703364	Is that a thing anymore?
9704125	9705406	People are camping
9706755	9712099	My younger brother, Greg, upon hearing about the preords and all of this, he sends me a message.
9712860	9716002	You are coming with me to camp out for the Wii U, right?
9716703	9717424	I guess.
9717764	9719165	You are coming, right?
9719345	9720906	Okay, I will be there.
9721147	9722147	Just save me some soup.
9723068	9724089	I don't want to camp out.
9724129	9726491	I just want to go on Amazon and have them ship it.
9726511	9727672	I'm just lazy.
9728610	9730052	I'm too old to camp out.
9730813	9731715	You haven't ordered it yet?
9732937	9734519	I don't care and I don't want one.
9735641	9737964	I'm hoping I have connections that can help me get one.
9738525	9739927	Well, I plan on getting one.
9740007	9741209	There you go.
9741229	9742351	Well, you have to let us know how it is.
9742910	9743650	Oh, by the way.
9743670	9745591	I'm just buying this.
9745631	9748611	I can just put it on eBay.
9748731	9750152	One thing real quick about Wreck-It Ralph.
9751172	9755153	The little film at the very beginning of it will give you sniffles.
9755773	9755953	Oh, yeah.
9755973	9757573	It was so Paper Man.
9757893	9759934	The little short, because that's like a thing now.
9759974	9763514	A lot of Pixar movies and Disney, even Disney classics, have these shorts in front of them.
9763534	9764074	Yeah, it was really good.
9764094	9766355	It was called Paper Man, and it was really sweet.
9766575	9766955	It was cute.
9766975	9767815	It was cute.
9768355	9768575	All right.
9768595	9771916	I'm referring Paper Man to Slender Man, albeit from me.
9772580	9774843	Alright, well Ranma, we're gonna let you go so we can get some more calls, okay?
9775344	9775864	Alright, cool.
9775964	9776525	Alright, bye!
9779266	9784590	Always nice to hear from Ranma, one of the hosts of Anime Jam Session, Tuesdays on the Voice of Geeks Network.
9784990	9789453	Although I didn't mention this during the show, but some of you probably picked up on this.
9789933	9793596	Our feed was down for like four days this week.
9793776	9794776	It was pretty crazy.
9795477	9798159	So some of our programming got rolled over to next week.
9798559	9804703	Critical Myth will be back next week with some of the episodes that got missed due to the outage.
9805123	9809026	I think the Warcraft shows, unfortunately, they're just going to have to be missed.
9809963	9812305	But anyway, we got another call coming in, so let's go to the phones.
9812365	9813306	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
9813326	9813666	Who's this?
9814807	9815227	Hey, guys.
9815268	9816889	It's the one and only Degenerate Johnny.
9817029	9817569	How you guys doing?
9817870	9819111	What is up, Degenerate Johnny?
9819151	9821213	You wrote that comment on Facebook earlier, right?
9821773	9822233	Yes, I did.
9822353	9824475	I called in to follow up on that.
9824615	9825076	Please do.
9826667	9839980	All right, so basically, it seems to me that gaming in the culture that we live today, it still hasn't really gotten it through these people's heads.
9840020	9841942	I mean, look back a few years back.
9843563	9844324	Fox News.
9845004	9850126	I geeked out when Fox News was saying, oh yeah, we're going to talk about Mass Effect.
9850146	9851627	I'm like, oh my goodness!
9852167	9856509	And it was nothing but a bash fest over that 30 second love scene.
9856549	9859830	I'm like, what the hell is this crap?
9860110	9864212	Of which there is much worse stuff shown on Fox Television.
9865013	9865513	Exactly.
9865533	9865893	Glee and shit.
9869841	9870982	Oh, that's it.
9871282	9875445	I was just saying Glee and House and all those shows have far worse content.
9876245	9876946	Right, exactly.
9876986	9888113	And even their quote-unquote expert, Cooper Lawrence, said herself that she saw sayings in Lost that were actually more explicit than that love scene.
9890154	9895778	But, you know, it seems amazing to me that, you know,
9896750	9899032	Nothing has evolved ever since, you know, 1993.
9900013	9904736	This is where I think the gaming industry has evolved.
9906057	9916265	It was the moment that Congress approached the Electronic Software Association after Mortal Kombat and Doom and saying, hey, you know what, we appreciate, you know,
9916912	9917372	DarkSakura.com
9938924	9941806	Well, let me throw this out there, just to be devil's advocate.
9941826	9945428	It's not that I disagree with you, but I want to throw this thought out here and see what you think about this.
9945789	9954935	Because 20 years ago, which, you know, 93 was almost 20 years ago at this point, another industry that faced a lot of battles in Congress was the music industry.
9955495	9959337	And this is because gangster rap started to take a storm a little bit.
9959678	9965361	And this is where that whole little black and white sticker that says parental advisory, caution, explicit lyrics came from.
9965541	9968023	And a lot of this is perpetuated by the same person between the two.
9968483	9969384	Yeah, hilarious, right?
9969744	9983374	But where it came from regardless, music doesn't get that same, pardon the pun, rap that video games does in being accepted in mainstream culture.
9983454	9988798	Although I guess one could argue there's still a lot of people that say gangster rap's not music.
9989158	9989819	It's garbage.
9991039	9994122	There's people out there that feel that way, whether they're right or wrong.
9994742	10020617	so I you know it's it's just interesting to me that you know music fought a lot of that stuff in the 90s too yet music I mean it fought it fought against that bell you know way before then I mean hell the Beatles were considered the devil's music that's right play the records backwards remember yeah I was like how am I working with the devil when I'm hearing I want to hold your hand what the hell
10021878	10028301	Because it's you wanting to hold the devil's hand as you walk through the lakes of fire and fiery hell.
10029321	10031682	Oh, dear lord, lordy, oh my goodness.
10032343	10036705	Yeah, you know, it just astounds me.
10036885	10048930	And, you know, to follow up on what I also said is that, you know, I do agree with you that entertainment today actually requires, you know, you know,
10049318	10051239	Thanks for watching!
10073144	10083940	and so I've been actually studying up on this and seeing how all these forms of entertainment obviously still some entertainments you know
10084972	10091894	are a little, you know, they cling to their old ways, you know, tradition, which I do respect.
10091934	10111039	You know, there are obviously plays and playwrights and it, you know, as a matter of fact, you know, what you and Jessica Harper recently did with the Rocky Horror, you know, I mean, that is a, you know, a form of evolution from, you know, the plays and playwrights and, you know, it's becoming, you know,
10113047	10118889	It's funny you bring that up because that in particular is something... I actually was at Rocky Horror last night.
10118909	10120530	That's why I got home at 5 in the morning.
10120710	10125072	Because I was with one of the Bay Area cast who was celebrating their 17th birthday as a cast.
10125532	10130554	Rocky Horror is something that's been around for 35 years.
10131094	10134676	But it is interesting you talk about it... God, I could fill another show with this.
10135076	10136477	You just set me on a tangent.
10137017	10145861	It is interesting that that whole stuff could be considered another art form because there's other movies now that, you know, people want to kind of shadow cast and bring to that.
10146262	10150924	And especially with the group I've been working with here in Sacramento, they really have made an art out of it.
10150964	10155486	I mean, I know I'm talking up, but you've got to see the way they do Repo the Genetic Opera.
10155966	10159568	I mean, like, that movie, for all practical purposes, is kind of stupid.
10160168	10162710	But when you see the stage show of it, you're like...
10163658	10165540	is this shit for real?
10165640	10188497	this is crazy I mean words can only can't even describe it it's the atmosphere and now they're talking about doing it for and I don't know how much I'm supposed to say on my little radio show or not but now they're talking about doing it for The Room and there was talk about doing Scott Pilgrim vs. The World at one point they've had to put that on hold I think it's a rights thing but that was like gonna be a thing so
10189346	10195513	Well, Jessica said something last night on Under Sedation Live that she was actually going to be doing something that involves a room.
10195673	10201460	Yeah, I have mixed feelings about the room, but anyway, we'll leave that to another show.
10202461	10204842	Alright, but let me go back to video games with this.
10204922	10207663	I want to ask you about this so we can wrap up.
10208703	10221287	Because you did kind of make the comment on Facebook, let me ask you, what would you like to see happen next with the video game movie working hand in hand together in this fusion?
10221327	10223287	What would you like to see happen next with that?
10223627	10226148	Or, do you think we need to stop obsessing about it?
10227583	10238640	Honestly, I think we need to stop obsessing on it because, you know, you look at the past, the two industries never really, you know, you know,
10239209	10245813	They never really generate a form of something that's really successful.
10258321	10259562	being based off of a game.
10259742	10261782	I don't see Oscar winning award games.
10261842	10268245	And I know we all want to see Mass Effect on the big screen and we want to see Warcraft on the big screen.
10268605	10271786	But in reality, I think we just... Those movies are going to suck.
10272607	10277328	If you are a fan of those games, there is no possible way those movies are going to satisfy you.
10277729	10281010	And I think I really do see your point here because there is no...
10281630	10289633	Possible way, no possible way you can adapt the Mass Effect games into a movie and leave people satisfied.
10289953	10291854	They will be pissed.
10292094	10296456	Just like Harry Potter fans always are mad that the books aren't adapted correctly.
10296956	10301821	I'm sure somebody's got a problem with Lord of the Rings, although to be fair, they do it okay.
10302822	10304964	Mass Effect is a video game.
10305045	10306406	It is not going to work as a movie.
10306646	10308288	But here's why Wreck-It Ralph worked.
10308668	10310350	Because Wreck-It Ralph wasn't a game.
10310730	10313293	It was a movie about gaming culture.
10314175	10314735	Exactly.
10315895	10341162	And that's why Hope is viewed as a story that involves the characters that we all love to play with, but I just hope it doesn't go past that and still is conceived as what video games are today, as a child's toy, because we have progressed so much beyond that point.
10342461	10347774	Alright, well Degenerate Johnny, I gotta let you go so we can see if we can get another call and wrap up the show, but great phone call.
10347814	10348475	Don't be a stranger.
10349618	10350199	Alright, take care.
10350760	10350921	Bye.
10352611	10353291	Really good points.
10354212	10358393	He hasn't called into the show an awful lot, but I like some of the points he was raising there.
10358453	10360093	So definitely worth talking to.
10360113	10360734	I appreciate it.
10361654	10364135	We are the show where every gamer has a voice.
10364155	10365015	1-877-GAME-OLR.
10365135	10367076	Our username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
10367396	10369977	If we can get another call in here real quick, we'll take it.
10370377	10372437	Otherwise, we might just wrap up for the night.
10372938	10377199	Let me go to Twitter, though, because I still had some more of these tweets I wanted to get to.
10377779	10382421	Including one from Tiger Claw that talks about the Halo 4 Amex card thing.
10383201	10390164	I remember reading a little bit about this, but, you know, I don't have an American Express myself, so I just kind of scrolled on by.
10390684	10402008	But apparently there is a partnership between Microsoft and American Express so that if you are a cardholder, you get coupons and credits for tying your account to Xbox Live and playing Halo 4.
10404025	10405206	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10422856	10428740	If you complete the single player campaign on normal or harder difficulty, you get a $25 statement credit.
10429280	10432522	If you are one of the first 25 people in the U.S.
10433383	10443329	to complete the campaign alone on legendary difficulty, you will be entered to win a trip to the 2013 Electronic Entertainment Expo.
10443349	10445171	Well, that's not irritating or anything.
10445811	10453012	because E3 is a very exclusive thing to be able to get into, but apparently you can win your way in through Amex.
10454533	10457453	I'm glad that the integrity is being kept up.
10457493	10471876	Yes, I'm so glad that we're keeping the independent press out of the events for the nasty, filthy things they'll say about it on the internet, yet we're going to let a contest winner from American Express get their way into the show.
10472556	10473276	I see how it is.
10475273	10475874	Is DRM going too far?
10489950	10491451	Sorry, I'm reading the story here real quick.
10491471	10491992	Let me look at this.
10493613	10495974	This is a forum post, okay?
10496755	10499276	He links us to a forum post on overclock.net.
10499697	10505461	Razer Synapse 2.0 software mouse unusable if you don't have an internet connection.
10506121	10515848	ThePoster, who goes by ChannelX99, just bought a new Naga 2012 mouse, installed the software, and got greeted by a login screen right after.
10516288	10522532	No option to bypass it to use the software to configure the mouse, set the options, sensitivity, shortcuts, macros, etc.
10522892	10524774	So I create an account and try to log in.
10525034	10525394	Nothing.
10525754	10526875	Try several more times.
10527315	10527676	Nothing.
10527996	10529057	Try to make new accounts.
10529137	10530678	Different email addresses won't work.
10531158	10536402	That's a stupid That's completely awful I would be writing a letter to the Better Business Bureau Which I'm about to be doing for Origin
10559373	10563736	DR, you can't... Do they sell counterfeit mice?
10563876	10565678	I mean, is that a thing?
10565958	10570641	I don't want to get political, but I'm honest to God, this is the first thought that jumps into my mind.
10571021	10574904	There's this very controversial proposition on the ballot in California.
10574944	10579367	It's Prop 37, and it has to do with labeling certain types of food.
10579887	10583190	I'm not going to get into where I'm leaning on this proposition or whatever.
10583230	10593078	I'm just going to say if it passes, there's going to be additional warning labels on food and restrictions on what can be called a natural food or not.
10594399	10598623	The reason why I bring that up, that mouse ought to carry a fucking sticker on it.
10598903	10599604	Bright and big.
10599904	10605929	Will not work without an interconnect connection because you, the buyer, have the right to know that shit before you buy it.
10607372	10608793	Take the mouse back, buddy.
10624127	10624548	and DarkSakura.
10645611	10650314	I hate to sound stupid and I might by saying this but I don't care.
10650654	10660361	Shouldn't there be like antitrust shit involved because you're forcing somebody to log up for your crap because you bought this particular product at the store.
10661342	10669788	It's like you're making somebody sign up for this other service because of your foothold in the mouse keyboard.
10670488	10672590	Isn't there a questionable legality to that?
10674045	10679153	I mean, maybe because we're talking about a mice and keyboard company that's kind of a niche market at gamers.
10679173	10681177	They do have their $2,500 laptop that's coming out this week as well.
10681197	10681277	Hmm.
10688466	10688787	Let's see.
10688847	10691129	Going to our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
10691730	10695915	Tiger Klaus says, the only thing I'm doing with the mouse or keyboard is turning the LEDs on or off.
10696275	10699178	So when I go to bed, I just load up the software to turn them off.
10699539	10703804	All other features it has, I don't use because that's mostly features associated to gaming.
10705565	10708849	One more tweet from Actdeft who says, Fairy Solitaire.
10709910	10712671	is free to download on Steam for a few days.
10713951	10714572	Who knew that?
10715372	10716832	Get it now, keep it forever.
10717312	10731437	If you want the addicting card game Fairy Solitaire where you find and raise a fairy pet and repopulate the magical land of Avalon using the resources found by clearing each level, sounds like you can get that on Steam for free right now.
10732197	10737724	And honestly, you should, even if you're not really that interested in it, if you're mildly interested, because, hey, it's free.
10738325	10740267	I know I'm giggling there, but you know what?
10740688	10742109	Props to them making it free.
10744332	10745634	I'm sure it's better than Yaris.
10748217	10751481	That is a very low bar to exceed there.
10753436	10759946	Alright, that's going to do it for our Twitter topic tonight and the other interactive parts of our show.
10761188	10762790	We're going to close up shop.
10764907	10766729	And did Skype just, like, freeze my computer?
10767950	10768750	Thanks, Skype.
10768891	10770972	You dropped the live listeners and everything.
10770992	10772233	Sorry, that was Skype's fault.
10772293	10773655	That was not Comcast's fault.
10773675	10774575	That was Skype's fault.
10775216	10776437	Sorry for the stream drop there.
10777458	10781701	All right, anyhow, that's going to do it for telephone calls and Twitter and all that good stuff.
10782022	10783643	Let's end the show.
10783703	10785645	Do you have any other last-minute stories either, you guys?
10785705	10786445	I have something to say.
10786685	10787046	Yeah, what?
10787186	10790208	Tomorrow is my mom's birthday, so happy birthday, Mom, even though you don't listen.
10790489	10792871	Happy birthday to DarkSakura's mom, even though she doesn't listen.
10793091	10793191	Yep.
10794318	10795700	Loki, any last minute stories or anything?
10796360	10797362	It's about a slow news week.
10797382	10798283	I don't have anything.
10798643	10800906	MXC in chat says, don't knock it.
10801006	10804590	I tried playing Fairy Solitaire on a whim and can't stop playing.
10804650	10805992	It's been three hours.
10808835	10810197	I have another thing to say.
10810337	10810457	Oh.
10810637	10811378	But I'll say it for last.
10812119	10813140	I want to quickly say this.
10813420	10820705	Shane, if you're listening and you're in chat, will you link the listeners that game you were talking to me earlier on Warcraft about?
10821205	10822206	It was hilarious.
10822246	10823947	I wish he'd called in to talk about it.
10824007	10825408	It sounded hilarious.
10825868	10830452	You start playing the game and it looks like an edutainment title that's about fractions.
10830832	10836656	But then he was talking about how it gets weirder and weirder and weirder.
10837256	10845301	and weirder and suddenly you're at the top of this government conspiracy and it turns into a text adventure game.
10846102	10850425	I tried playing it for 30 seconds and I'm like, I don't get the joke.
10850525	10851506	This is a stupid game.
10851606	10852286	Close window.
10852586	10856629	But then he was telling me about it on Vent and I was laughing because it sounded really ridiculous.
10856869	10863774	So if he's not listening, I'll get the link from him and we can talk about it next week because Loki, I think you of all of us should probably play this game.
10863814	10864935	It sounds like something you'd get a kick out of.
10864955	10865475	Sounds awesome.
10865595	10866976	You like flash games that are weird.
10867758	10875438	all right um okay let's go around and get everybody's final thought Jamie you had something in mind already so I'll start with you tonight your final thought I'm gonna wreck it
10877784	10880445	My final thought tonight is Baked Potato.
10881205	10882166	Loki, your final thought tonight.
10883726	10884467	Mob Arena.
10884607	10886107	Hopefully they'll be coming soon.
10886487	10889849	Otherwise, check out the map that we have for the VOG server.
10889889	10891609	If you're not part of it, you should join.
10892630	10894410	It's fun, and you get to build stuff.
10894450	10900092	But if you want to check out the map, vogmc.co.cc, and you can check out what we're building.
10900853	10901193	Peek in.
10902613	10904776	That's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10904836	10910461	Thank you guys so much for downloading our show or listening to us live, however you choose to participate with Orange Lounge Radio.
10910521	10911542	We really appreciate it.
10911602	10913864	And you know we've said this a lot, but it is true.
10914205	10915366	We're an independent show.
10915666	10916847	We don't ask for anything.
10917208	10919290	Please just tell a friend or two.
10919330	10920251	I guess this is something.
10920271	10921772	I mean, we don't ask for money and stuff, but...
10922953	10923613	I like money, though.
10923634	10924474	You could just give it to me.
10924914	10927696	Tell a friend or two or five about the show.
10928036	10929197	Help spread the word.
10929557	10934820	The voting in the podcast towards we talked about earlier, that's a great way to do that, but there's other ways to spread the word, too.
10935180	10935861	Tell a friend.
10936161	10937522	Give us a nice review somewhere.
10937782	10939383	Help spread the word of Orange Lounge Radio.
10939403	10941064	Let's get some other voices in the community.
10941104	10944406	We had some great discussion tonight on a lot of different topics.
10944426	10945126	This was a good show.
10945166	10946627	This was a very grown-up show, Ryan.
10946647	10948727	This is a very grown-up show, so we need some more voices.
10948747	10950708	This is a special episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
10950728	10951008	It was.
10951048	10952028	It was a very special one.
10952068	10953368	Vote or P. Diddy will kill you.
10953428	10953848	That's right.
10953928	10955929	And vote or P. Diddy will kill you.
10955969	10958569	And of course, we're talking about the podcast voice.
10959969	10962550	No, we mean the election on Tuesday.
10962570	10964130	Get your friends to vote, too.
10965090	10965590	For both.
10965670	10966391	More the merrier.
10966471	10966851	That's right.
10967091	10967311	All right.
10967551	10968071	Thanks, you guys.
10968291	10969071	Have a wonderful night.
10969111	10971431	We'll see you next week to do this all over again.
10972112	10973252	Where's the closing music?
10975796	10977140	for your consideration.
10977261	10978585	Best gaming podcast.
10978846	10979287	Here it is.
