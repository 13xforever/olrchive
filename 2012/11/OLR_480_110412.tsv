0	19780	Tonight, November 4th, 2012, Sony reports a loss of close to $200 million.
19780	24600	Details emerge on Nintendo Network Premium, and one vice president of a retail gaming
24600	29760	company pleads guilty to embezzlement.
29760	35180	Hello, my friends out there on the internet, and welcome back to another week of the show
35180	37360	where every gamer has a voice.
37360	45420	It is Orange Lounge Radio episode number 480 for this November the 4th of 2012.
45420	50000	I hope for those of you guys that go out and do stuff on Halloween, you had a good Halloween,
50000	53300	and I can't believe it, but now is that time of year where we start seeing all the Christmas
53300	58920	stuff show up in stores and all that fa la la la la la la, and I'm sure wanting to comment
58920	61960	on that is the one and only DarkSakura, or Jamie Summers.
61960	67560	I still haven't seen any Hanukkah stuff, and Hanukkah is like two weeks before Christmas.
67560	70080	It's just, it's not fair.
70080	77160	I think that it's bigotry, it's prejudice.
77160	84280	To be fair, I haven't seen any Festivus polls, so they're hating on Festivus 2, so.
84280	85280	Oh my god.
85280	86280	Anyhow.
86280	90320	I just saw a funny thing in chat, so I'm not gonna say it because I'm not talking about
90320	91320	politics.
91320	92320	Alright.
92320	93320	Thank gosh.
93320	94320	Alright.
94320	95720	Also say hello to Techmaster Loki.
95720	96720	Hi.
96720	97720	How are you, Loki?
97720	98720	I'm fine.
98720	99720	Excellent.
99720	100720	What's new with you?
100720	101720	How was your week?
101720	102720	It's been alright.
102720	103720	Yeah?
103720	104720	Lots of Minecraft.
104720	105720	Lots of Minecraft.
105720	109240	You were showing me, okay tell me about this little thing you were, this was cool, this
109240	111400	map thing you were showing me before the show.
111400	112400	How does that work?
112400	113920	How can our listeners check this out?
113920	114920	You can check it out.
114920	120520	This new website I made for the VoG Minecraft server, it's basically because I get free
120520	125440	website hosting for having the Minecraft server being hosted by this company, and I needed
125440	134800	a webpage to put this map plugin on, so it's, if you go to vogmc.co.cc, and that will pull
134800	143840	up the, it's a plugin called dynamic map, and basically it's almost in real time.
143840	147600	There's a little bit of, there's some glitches, like I've noticed a few blocks not updating,
147600	153560	but it's pretty much in real time, and it shows just everything that's on the server.
153560	160680	You can take a peek and see what people are building, and just kind of how things look.
160680	165080	Maybe get you interested in joining up on the server, because it's fun.
165080	168360	So we've got that, but yeah, check it out.
168360	171040	You can even see when people are playing, you can see them moving around and where they're
171040	175520	at and stuff like that, and you can watch chat, so it's kind of fun.
175520	178940	That's kind of neat, that you can do that all live, and I like being able to see kind
178940	183200	of the, like, just isometric view, and I even found my house on there, you helped, but I
183200	184600	was able to find the house and all that stuff.
184600	188120	Yeah, I haven't gotten around to labeling everything yet, like some people's places,
188120	190080	I don't know who built them, you know.
190080	191680	I know, I was like, Loki, what's that?
191680	192680	I don't know.
192680	193680	Loki, what's that?
193680	194680	I don't know.
194680	197540	It's like, I've seen that there, I just don't remember, and there was one time I did see
197540	202300	who built it, but I don't remember who it was, because they were standing there, idling,
202300	208000	and I just, I didn't remember, because some people are not, you know, responsible enough
208000	213200	to label their houses with signs, so I know who's, you know, building what.
213200	215980	Your roller coaster is epic too, by the way.
215980	216980	It's pretty large.
216980	217980	I haven't ridden it yet.
217980	218980	I'm still not going to play it until someone buys it for me.
218980	223020	But I, what she's not going to tell you is that when she saw the map and was looking
223020	226300	at everything, she was like, okay, maybe I do need to play this.
226860	227860	No, no.
227860	229460	She's starting to turn around a little bit.
229460	230460	Yeah.
230460	231460	Loki's magic is working a little bit.
231460	234540	I'm going to put my foot down, when someone buys it for me, then I'll play it.
234540	237740	All right, well, maybe Hanukkah Harry will bring you a copy.
237740	240540	I'd rather have the N7 hoodie.
240540	241540	All right.
241540	245140	Um, let's see, other kickoff topics I wanted to talk about tonight.
245140	249480	I did not realize, Loki, you did not go see the big movie that everybody in the gaming
249480	252700	world's talking about this weekend, Wreck-It Ralph.
252700	253700	What stopped you from going?
253700	255700	You see all the big new movies.
256100	257100	No, I don't actually.
257100	258100	You usually do.
258100	260100	I used to before I had a kid.
260100	262700	Oh, is that, well, this is a kid's movie, sorta.
262700	265540	Well, I just, I didn't get a chance to go see it.
265540	270060	I mean, I still want to see it, but it's just, I haven't gotten to go see it yet.
270060	271060	All right.
271060	273380	Well, I thought I'd start off with this topic tonight cause a lot of people talking about
273380	274380	this movie.
274380	275380	It was good.
275380	276380	It was good.
276380	282380	Wreck-It Ralph, uh, was the top of the box office this weekend and made 49.1 million.
282380	285940	That is the estimate for on today, Sunday, the day we are recording.
285940	290340	And apparently they're crediting its performance, which was very good.
290340	294820	It's the highest Disney animation classic opening ever.
294820	298920	I want to note it was, even though it looked like a Pixar movie, it was not a Pixar movie.
298920	303860	So it did not beat all the Pixar movies, but it did be all of the Disney classics, which
303860	308380	includes Tangled, which was also kind of that same animation style.
308380	312260	If you saw that movie, but it made 49.1 million, at least that's the estimate.
312260	317760	Now the interesting thing is they are crediting Hurricane Sandy for some of the reason why
317760	321660	it did so well, because a lot of kids didn't have school on Friday.
321660	326380	A lot of people wanted to just get away, you know, out of the nightmare that they'd been
326380	328800	living the past week and go see a movie.
328800	333700	So they're actually saying it was part of the reason it had a little bit of a boost.
333700	334700	But I don't know.
334700	337820	I mean, I, I just know a lot of people that I know were really interested in seeing this
337820	343080	movie and it really did seem like the type of thing that was geared at families as well
343080	348620	as, you know, it had the classic stuff was great.
348620	352820	The references, if you caught them, I have to go see it again.
352820	354860	I'm going to try to phrase this without spoiling it.
354860	355860	I saw it too.
355860	356940	And I had a great time.
356940	362300	And I think the great thing about it is that, well, obviously I like two things and we talk
362300	365420	about it a lot on this show, video games and Disney.
365420	367460	And this movie was really both.
367820	375100	The neat thing about it is that it wasn't really about the video games.
375100	380220	It was, but it wasn't like, there's a lot of people asking, why isn't Mario in the movie?
380220	382060	Why is Bowser in the movie and not Mario?
382060	385980	And the real answer is that he's expensive, but I think there's another layer to it.
385980	389220	And that is if Mario had been in the movie, it would have been kind of distracting because
389220	390880	this movie is not about Mario.
390880	395740	It's about these made up characters that exist in this universe with all the characters that
395740	397020	we love.
397020	401820	So I kind of think it was neat that it was this very traditional Disney story.
401820	406700	And for all practical purposes, it was pretty formulaic for the rest of the Disney movies.
406700	408700	Not that that's a bad thing.
408700	411900	But you know, it was kind of what you'd expect from a Disney movie.
411900	418540	But it took place in this universe that co-exists alongside Street Fighter, Qbert, you know,
418540	421220	Sega games, all these other things.
421220	422860	What did you think about them going to the Tapper?
422860	424620	Oh, I thought that was great.
424620	425620	Yeah.
426020	427780	I thought about you when I saw that.
427780	428780	Where they reference Tapper.
428780	431740	And one of my friends sitting next to me was like, is Tapper a real game?
431740	434060	I'm like, oh, my God, how old are you?
434060	435980	I'm like, I'm way older than you.
435980	438860	I remember Tapper when it was in the arcades.
438860	443860	Dan completely jumped at the and I'm not going to say any more than this, the road blasters.
443860	444860	Mm hmm.
444860	445860	Yeah.
445860	451980	And we thought of what the the one thing was supposed to be a reference to as far as another
451980	452980	game.
452980	453980	It actually was related to another game.
454340	455340	Rally X.
455340	456340	Oh, yeah.
456340	457340	Yeah.
457340	461140	So and there was lots of little references and I don't want to spoil everything, but
461140	464780	I will say, if you haven't seen the movie yet, you plan on seeing it soon.
464780	467860	A stay till the very, very, very end of the credits.
467860	468860	Yes.
468860	472140	For a little, you know, like most movies, it's not a big thing, but it's one of those
472140	474940	things that when you see it, you'll be like, oh, that's clever.
474940	475940	That's funny.
475940	476940	L.O.L.
476940	481820	And then also, crap, what else is I going to say?
481820	482820	I don't know.
482820	483820	The graffiti.
484660	485660	Keep an eye out for the various graffiti.
485660	488280	There's so many little jokes on the side.
488280	493100	And actually, you can see Princess Peach and Princess Toadstool like totally in the movie,
493100	494860	but they're like in the background.
494860	495860	It's it.
495860	496860	But it's them.
496860	497860	It's totally.
497860	499540	There was the one scene with the one walking with the two with Chinley walking with the
499540	503260	two princesses, but neither of them were.
503260	505860	Peter, I think one of one of them was in blue.
505860	506860	I think one was day.
506860	507860	Oh, probably Pauline.
507860	508860	Yeah.
508860	509860	Yeah.
509860	510860	And Pauline.
510860	511860	So very interesting.
511860	513500	Let's go to our chat room.
514180	518140	I'm being a very bad boy and I did not introduce our chat yet, but we do love our live chatters.
518140	519300	We love the podcast listeners.
519300	523540	We also have the people that join us live every Sunday night at the voice voice of Geeks
523540	525980	Network or vog network dot com.
525980	529900	We do tape live every Sunday night at six Pacific and nine o'clock Eastern right after
529900	532140	the Bobby Black Wolf show.
532140	535700	And we have a live chat room that you can chat along with us at live dot vog network
535700	537140	dot com.
537140	540380	And Game Guru in chat says it was Daisy and Rosalina.
540380	541380	That's the name.
541380	542380	I couldn't think of her name.
542380	543380	It was Rosalina.
544260	545460	Pauline was Donkey Kong.
545460	546460	Yeah.
546460	549860	Pauline was Donkey Kong, but I thought they retroactively made her a princess or something.
549860	551220	I thought there was some retcon.
551220	552660	She was wearing pink.
552660	556620	It's like the same thing where everybody's like, oh, Leia is a Disney princess now.
556620	557740	Leia is a Disney princess.
557740	559540	That's the way I just think that that's funny.
559540	560540	Hold on.
560540	561540	Put the brakes on that chat.
561540	563740	We'll get there in a minute.
563740	565660	But meanwhile, let's see.
565660	569580	Dan Shadow in our chat room says, I hate end credits crap.
569580	571180	I hate end credits crap.
571180	572900	Do you hate end credits crap?
573420	574660	I love it.
574660	579580	I actually make a habit of staying through the credits regardless, because I think that
579580	583300	a lot of people behind the scenes put a lot of hard work in the movie and that's sort
583300	585140	of my nod to them and that.
585140	586140	And I hear good music.
586140	587540	I check the soundtrack listings.
587540	590100	I downloaded the soundtrack in the theater.
590100	593140	I had a room, AKB 48.
593140	596100	I had a roommate in college that was very much like you, where it was like whenever
596100	598860	we would go to see the movies, it's like, nope, we're not leaving till after the credits
598860	599860	was over.
599860	601660	And it was nothing about bonus scenes or anything like that.
601660	604860	It was just, no, we're going to watch the entire movie.
604860	607960	And I was like, all right, I guess everybody's got their thing.
607960	608960	You don't want it.
608960	610060	You don't want to get the jump on getting out of here.
610060	611060	Get parking lot.
611060	612060	All right.
612060	613060	All right.
613060	614060	We'll stay and watch the credits.
614060	615060	It's fine.
615060	616060	So I think that's that's fine though.
616060	617060	Let's see.
617060	620740	What is to see some people talking about the wizard.
620740	625340	Raginator says, so Wreck-It Ralph was about as much about video games as the wizard was
625340	626540	then.
626540	629620	In a funny way, yes.
630180	634980	I kind of don't like acknowledging that that reference works because the wizard was a very
634980	636280	different type of movie.
636280	638540	And for all practical purposes, let's be real.
638540	641020	It wasn't a very good movie.
641020	645420	We just, we remember it being awesome because we were kids and it had that look at Super
645420	651100	Mario three and you know, the power glove, it's so bad and all that like commercial shit
651100	653220	that's like, you know, shoved down your throat.
653220	654380	Wreck-It Ralph didn't really have that.
654380	655900	Like Wreck-It Ralph wasn't the Wii.
655900	656900	It wiggles.
657500	660620	Now I did see a Wii U commercial in the theater before the movie.
660620	662500	That's the only time I've seen a Wii U commercial.
662500	663940	Somebody was asking, they only have one.
663940	666980	Somebody was asking on Twitter today, like, why are there not Wii U commercials on TV
666980	667980	and all this stuff?
667980	669780	I'm like, I saw one in the movie theater.
669780	671860	Putting it before Wreck-It Ralph seems like a nice place to do it.
671860	672860	You know what?
672860	676900	They did this thing for Cartoon Network live TV shows.
676900	683060	And my husband was like, I miss that commercial that ran for five years with What's-Her-Face.
683060	684060	What was it?
684060	685060	The Closer?
685060	686060	Or something?
686940	691620	But then they showed the Ultimate Geek trailer because you know how lately, I don't know
691620	694660	if every theater in America does this, but at least all the ones around here do.
694660	698500	They have that thing called the Fathom Events where it's like the Metropolitan Night at
698500	702500	the Opera or I think Riff Tracks does their stuff through Fathom Events.
702500	704580	But here's the big thing they're doing at the end of November.
704580	709220	They're doing two episodes of Star Trek The Next Generation in HD.
709220	710220	People cheered.
710220	712700	And everybody in the theater cheered.
712700	713700	And we're like.
713700	714700	Because it's geeks.
714740	716420	This one is DS9, bitches.
719420	721740	But just for the record, I still want to go to that.
721740	722740	Just saying.
722740	727140	We need to make plans November 29th because I love Star Trek The Next Generation.
727140	728140	All right.
728140	729140	Let's see.
729140	730140	What else?
730140	731620	What else did I want to say about the movie?
731620	732620	I don't know.
732620	734220	I liked it quite a bit.
734220	739900	You know, again, it's not like shoving the video games in your face, but I'm really glad
740180	744340	that this part of pop culture is just.
744340	747920	It's there and it's being acknowledged without it being niche.
747920	752220	And it's really cool now that, you know, I think there's a lot of parents out there who
752220	755340	remember a lot of these games from when they were younger.
755340	757780	And now we need a TV series, right?
757780	761380	Well, it will be interesting to see if the movie continues to do well.
761380	764980	I heard it had a very large budget, so it has a lot of money to make up.
764980	768460	But if the movie does well, which, you know, if it's had a bigger opening than Tangled
768500	773060	and there's really not a lot of competition for the movie coming till Thanksgiving, it
773060	774500	stands to do pretty well.
774500	777180	It will be interesting to see, does this mean sequel?
777180	781480	Does this mean Disney Park integration is possible?
781480	783680	They're putting a Tangled thing into Disneyland.
783680	788400	The expanded Fantasyland is going to have a Tangled section to it.
788400	791060	So could Wreck-It Ralph come to Tomorrowland?
791060	795940	Could the arcade, you know, which is kind of a bummer because I was hoping it would
795940	797940	be Tron, but I do love it.
798940	799940	Let's hope.
799940	800940	Let's hope.
800940	801940	I hope.
801940	802940	I don't doubt the other world.
802940	805900	All right, let's quickly talk about the other nerd news that came out this week before we
805900	811500	get into video games, because this does affect video games a tiny, tiny bit, but I am positive
811500	816660	you all have heard this, but if for some reason you've been just like locked away in a nuclear
816660	822340	fallout shelter for the past, you know, week, Disney bought LucasArts this week and they
822340	826900	paid what, $4.5 billion for it and promptly announced they're making Star Wars Episode
826900	831260	7 and obviously this meets hugely mixed fanboy reaction.
831260	832740	Did you hear the other side of that?
832740	835700	Lucas turned around and donated the money to education.
835700	837420	He said he's going to donate it to education.
837420	838420	He hasn't done it yet.
838420	839540	He just announced plans to.
839540	844180	By education he means an educator, which is Indiana Jones, which he owns, but it's just
844180	845180	donated to himself.
845180	847980	Well, I don't want to be morbid, but does that mean he's going to die?
847980	851100	Because like, isn't that a little weird that he's like offloading it all?
851100	854740	Well, he's probably just ready to retire.
855300	859060	He's keeping his Marin properties.
859060	867180	So the game developing building and his ranch, the Skywalker Ranch, is staying under his
867180	872580	property, including everything that's on it, but the company itself, because he wanted
872580	875860	to build a movie theater in Marin County and all the people with their nose in the air
875860	879300	said, well, it is Marin County.
879300	880300	Yeah.
880300	884040	So, so I think that had something to do with it, but yeah, one story.
884040	885400	But no, no, no, it's fine.
885400	886400	But here's the thing.
886400	891840	Besides the Star Wars thing, which personally, I thank God somebody took it away from Lucas.
891840	892840	Let's be real.
892840	894000	Indiana Jones.
894000	896680	How can it be worse than the prequels?
896680	899640	How will it possibly be worse than the prequels?
899640	903880	I don't care if it is Mickey and Goofy, you know, which it won't be.
903880	904880	We all know it won't be.
904880	907080	How can it possibly be worse than the prequels?
907080	910280	There was a statement too that it's changing the canon from the books.
910280	912680	Well, I seem to remember.
912680	913680	Who reads books nowadays?
913680	916080	Well, it's not a lot of people that are in those days.
916080	920480	I realized that they, people want those Star Wars books to be adapted, but I seem to recall
920480	924620	around the time the prequels came out, there were many interviews with George Lucas where
924620	931080	he said, when he did the first trilogy, he always planned for there to be three trilogies
931080	936060	and the recurring characters that would be an online movies would be C3PO and R2D2.
936060	940440	And there'd be a trilogy before the original trilogy and there'd be a trilogy after the
940440	942000	original trilogy.
942000	946160	And he always said that it was going to be nine movies.
946160	949020	But then when he was making the prequels, he was like, you know what?
949020	951840	I don't think there's going to be anything else after this.
951840	956040	But now that he's actually the creative consultant or whatever, my thought is Disney's going
956040	961320	to take his outline for the nine movies or the seven, eight, nine movies and make that
961320	962320	which...
962320	963320	Better dialogue.
963320	964320	Yeah.
964320	969360	And he told, it's out there that he talked with Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher last year
969360	970360	about this.
970360	974320	They're way too old to reprise the roles unless it's way set in the future.
974320	981360	Or they said that Luke Skywalker could be the Obi-Wan Kenobi type of the new movies
981360	983000	and that would make a lot of sense.
983000	987300	But the reoccurring characters would be C3PO and R2D2 because they're androids, they don't
987300	988300	die.
988300	991440	And that makes a lot of sense.
991440	998040	But I'm curious enough, anyhow, sorry, I didn't mean to get on a movie tangent.
998040	1001960	The big thing is that if they're going to, I mean, for them to realistically have those
1001960	1009600	people play the same characters, they're going to have to change the book canon anyway.
1009600	1015600	Which honestly, the book canon was going way too crazy and I couldn't even deal with it.
1015600	1017520	Rageinator says, how can it be worse?
1017520	1020640	This is how episode seven can be centered around Jar Jar.
1020640	1021640	It can't.
1021640	1023320	Seven will be after the original trilogy.
1023320	1025000	Jar Jar will be dead.
1025000	1027120	In fact, I want to point this out.
1027120	1031040	If you think that Disney's going to fuck up Star Wars, you need to go ride the new Star
1031040	1036040	Tours ride because the best ending on that's because you know, the Star Wars ride has the
1036040	1037180	multiple endings.
1037180	1041360	The best ending is the one where they go to Jar Jar's planet because somebody, somebody
1041360	1043520	shoots him.
1043520	1047100	Disney shot Jar Jar and you all are pissed.
1047100	1049640	By the way, Rob, your nerd logic doesn't make sense.
1049640	1050640	Let it go.
1050640	1051640	By the way, I finally got Hoth.
1051640	1052640	Oh, did you?
1052640	1053640	It was awesome.
1053640	1054640	Yeah, it is awesome.
1055280	1056280	The ice plan is the best.
1056280	1062360	But anyhow, uh, let's see, uh, that, uh, that, uh, that, uh, YYR says Star Wars episode seven
1062360	1064640	begins with the assassination of Jar Jar Binks.
1064640	1065640	You're welcome.
1065640	1067680	Uh, no, he won't be in it at all.
1067680	1068960	They're just going to look past it.
1068960	1073800	Uh, as you want to get gunk and live for hundreds of years, SSJ 100, Matt says, just please
1073800	1077520	don't have JJ Abrams direct the next three.
1077520	1081060	That would be weird because that's like the crossing the streams thing.
1081060	1083260	You don't cross Trek and Wars.
1083260	1086880	Like I've seen a lot of people campaigning for Zachary Quinto to be a villain in Star
1086880	1087880	Wars.
1087880	1092160	He can't, he's locked into Trek and I just, I think there is this nerd thing.
1092160	1093820	You don't cross Trek and Wars.
1093820	1094820	You can't do it.
1094820	1100060	However, it is completely hilarious to sing Star Trek in, in line for Star, Star Wars.
1100060	1103780	Just saying, especially when you get the cast members singing along with you.
1103780	1108900	Um, let's see, uh, the Rob D says Han and Leia's kids have a complete story.
1108900	1109900	Seriously.
1109900	1112800	The books go so far into the future that the story of their kids has been told.
1112840	1114360	I think it would make a lot of sense.
1114360	1115560	I swear we'll get to games.
1115560	1119860	I brought this up to talk games and I'm talking movies and I'm always more of a Trek fan than
1119860	1120860	a Wars fan.
1120860	1126140	But I think it would make a lot of sense for the Star Wars next trilogy to be about the
1126140	1131880	children of Luke Skywalker because the books that were about Han and Leia's kids, but that
1131880	1133260	doesn't mean it has to be on the books.
1133260	1134260	Get away from the book.
1134260	1135260	The books are not being turned into movies.
1135260	1136260	Mara Jade is in it.
1136260	1137260	I'm happy.
1137260	1138260	The books will not be turned into movies.
1138260	1139260	Period.
1139260	1140260	Mara Jade needs to be in it.
1140260	1141620	You're stretching it.
1141620	1147300	That may happen only because they ended up calling one of the planets Kors Kont in the
1147300	1149300	prequels because that came from the books.
1149300	1150300	Yeah.
1150300	1153300	So they also referenced it in, I think the first one.
1153300	1154300	Oh, anyway.
1154300	1157700	Uh, Tiger Claw says, how about Joss Whedon directing Star Wars?
1157700	1158700	I could go with that.
1158700	1162780	Um, I think while that would make a lot of nerds happy, why don't you give him the time
1162780	1164420	to do all this stuff with the Avengers?
1164420	1166020	Like he's one guy.
1166020	1168500	He can't, he can't do everything nerd.
1168500	1175340	Um, I would, I'd like to see some of these, um, Oh God, I'm going to get, I'm going to
1175340	1179240	get so much shit for this, but I think it would be really cool to get somebody like
1179240	1184660	one of the, um, uh, Harry Potter directors that made the really looking forward to Tim
1184660	1185660	Burton's adaptation.
1185660	1187460	No, no, no, no, no.
1187460	1193660	Alfonso Cuaron who did the third, um, Guillermo del Toro, although he didn't do a Harry Potter
1193660	1196660	movie, but he's, you know, Pan's Labyrinth and all the stuff he does.
1197660	1198660	Yeah.
1198660	1199660	All right.
1199660	1202500	Look, the quick thing I wanted to say, and then I swear we'll get to video games.
1202500	1203940	This is about video games.
1203940	1207660	When Disney bought Lucas arts, they didn't just buy Star Wars.
1207660	1208660	That's all everybody's talking about.
1208660	1211460	Cause they announced Star Wars episode seven, but they, what do they get with this?
1211460	1216780	They get Indiana Jones, they get American graffiti, ha ha ha.
1216780	1225280	They get all the Lucas arts games belong to Disney now, although I kind of doubt Disney's
1225320	1227320	going to do anything with it.
1227320	1228320	Maniac mansion.
1228320	1229320	That's right.
1229320	1230580	Disney now owns maniac mansion.
1230580	1234040	I doubt they'll do anything with it, but they did say they were very interested in developing
1234040	1237880	the games in the mobile and social space.
1237880	1243880	I would love to see an animated maniac mansion movie, but they'll probably continue to contract
1243880	1248080	with other developers to do Star Wars on the console.
1248080	1251400	Now if we're talking like Tim Burton, that is a movie that Tim Burton would be perfect
1251400	1253040	doing maniac mansion.
1253040	1255240	Oh, that would be awesome.
1255240	1256800	And uh, Oh, good points in our chat room.
1256800	1258640	Dan shadow says ILM.
1258640	1259640	That's very true.
1259640	1261800	Tiger class says Skywalker sound.
1261800	1263240	So Disney picks up all that.
1263240	1264240	That's great.
1264240	1270520	And again, I'm just going to say, how can it get, how can it get any worse than it already
1270520	1271520	was?
1271520	1279120	And what I mean by that is if you have played that Star Wars connect game, have you played
1279120	1280120	that Star Wars connect game?
1280120	1282880	I just, because I'm smart enough to know that it's terrible.
1282880	1285480	I just want to remind you be quiet advertisement.
1285480	1289680	I just want to remind you of a little sequence that's in the, uh, in the star Wars connect
1289680	1290680	game.
1290680	1294040	And that is the dance battle to I'm Han solo.
1294040	1295520	Let me play a little clip of that.
1295520	1296520	Just there's a bunch.
1296520	1298240	All of the songs are easily terrible.
1298240	1302140	Just to remind you how bad things can be.
1302140	1303140	Just want to remind you that here
1303140	1309900	have you seen this board?
1309900	1323140	Our saga, this star Wars connect game
1323140	1326080	and that's going to get worse under Disney.
1326080	1329060	It can't get worse at famous last words.
1329060	1332460	It can't get worse.
1332460	1338540	Disney owns the rights to Howard, the duck, however, they actually do own Howard, the
1338540	1341340	duck because they own Marvel.
1341340	1342340	All right.
1342340	1343340	Rageinator says, just wait.
1343340	1345300	Disney will buy the rights to rock your picture show next.
1345300	1348580	And then they'll blend star Wars and rock your picture show and sky would probably squeak.
1348580	1351980	No, that wouldn't happen because that would involve buying 20th century Fox.
1351980	1359980	And I think, I think there's laws set up for that big of an acquisition.
1359980	1360980	Let's see.
1360980	1361980	Rama says.
1362020	1364540	Disney makes Marvel a former shell of itself.
1364540	1367380	Oh, oh yeah.
1367380	1370340	Disney really fucked up Marvel with that Avengers movie.
1370340	1372220	They were, oh yeah, that, that was terrible.
1372220	1373780	Oh, and Disney really fucked them up.
1373780	1374780	It's over.
1374780	1375780	Yeah.
1375780	1382860	That new Muppets movie was really bad compared to the last couple dot, dot, dot.
1382860	1385340	Is your mic off?
1385340	1386340	My mic was off.
1386340	1387340	Sorry.
1387340	1389140	Now they just need to buy the mega moon franchise.
1389140	1390140	Yes.
1390140	1391140	Yes.
1391300	1392300	And blizzard.
1392300	1393300	Okay.
1393300	1399100	Now, God, this is why I miss my old mic cause it didn't have an off switch, but, um, the,
1399100	1402980	the whole thing I wanted to point out too, is that don't worry anything about Indiana
1402980	1403980	Jones.
1403980	1407060	It doesn't matter who has, first of all, I don't want to see another Indiana Jones movie
1407060	1410420	because it can only be Harrison Ford and he's too old.
1410420	1413140	We saw this plus that crystal school thing.
1413140	1414140	Shit.
1414140	1416860	Disney still has licensing rights to Indiana Jones.
1416860	1421180	How else are they going to have, you know, the ride for one thing.
1421180	1424660	How else are they going to have all of the merchandise that they sell at Disneyland?
1424660	1427580	And on top of that, they have the pinball table.
1427580	1432700	This is how Indiana Jones, Indiana Jones will come again, but it's going to be in about
1432700	1438900	10 to 15 years after the Indiana Jones is what Disney will do after the trilogy is done.
1438900	1440920	And that's going to be a good 10 years away.
1440920	1444260	They're going to do Indiana Jones next and it will be the good old fashioned Hollywood
1444260	1445660	fix it reboot.
1445660	1446660	Just wait for it.
1446660	1449100	I do not want a Shia LaBeouf reboot.
1449100	1451060	I want a good actor.
1451060	1453820	Just saying good reboot could put a good actor in the role.
1453820	1458220	Just saying, but as long as it needs to be done after we're all dead.
1458220	1459220	All right.
1459220	1460940	Too much movies, not enough games.
1460940	1462580	Let's talk about video games again.
1462580	1465860	We always like to start off the show, you know, 30 minutes into it with how was your
1465860	1466980	gaming week?
1466980	1469060	Let's talk about the video games that you've been playing this week.
1469060	1470060	Dark soccer.
1470060	1471060	We'll start with you.
1471060	1476100	Well, you know, I actually, uh, didn't get to play much cause I started a job, have a
1476100	1477100	job now.
1477100	1478100	Congrats.
1478100	1479100	Thank you.
1479100	1486180	Um, and, uh, I, uh, I downloaded a demo for a game that I'm going to talk about in part
1486180	1491200	B. Um, I never got a chance to play it cause I've been working, um, but I've been playing
1491200	1495580	a bunch of, uh, mass effect two cause I beat mass effect one earlier.
1495580	1497420	Finally did everything in the first mass effect.
1497420	1501340	So it wasn't that you had played the demo cause you didn't play the demo cause you were
1501340	1502340	working.
1502340	1504220	You didn't play the demo cause you were playing mass effect two.
1504220	1506500	It has to be real.
1506500	1507620	Just it's, it's okay.
1507620	1511880	And I logged into wow long enough so I wouldn't get booted from the guild.
1511880	1517820	I haven't touched like wow more than long enough to say hi to people since and oh, and
1517820	1520380	for the record, I still can't get in my mass effect three.
1520380	1522700	Just saying, that's still a thing.
1522700	1523700	Yeah.
1523700	1524700	I watched that.
1524700	1530700	Um, that mod ending, it was, yeah, somebody actually bad.
1530700	1535140	Somebody actually made a mod that will change the ending to the happy ending.
1535140	1539820	They call it the mass effect three happy ending and I clipping issues though.
1539820	1543920	Well, the thing that cracked me the fuck up is that they inserted video footage obviously
1543920	1548540	from other places in the game, but some of them had an IGN watermark and I was like,
1548540	1549540	really?
1549540	1550540	If yes, really?
1550540	1553660	No, I mean that was what I was thinking really, really.
1553660	1561620	And on top of that, most of the footage of the space battle thing is from the low preparedness
1561620	1562620	thing.
1562620	1563620	Whatever.
1563620	1565500	The, the, yeah, I know what you're talking about.
1565500	1566500	The universe rating.
1566500	1567500	Yeah.
1567500	1572060	Cause I've watched like all the different versions of the endings to see what affected
1572060	1573060	what.
1573060	1576660	And yeah, that's like from the super low I did shit where the Normandy explodes and everyone
1576660	1577660	dies ending.
1577660	1578660	I was like, really?
1578660	1581700	This must be happy ending, huh?
1581700	1587700	It was, it was interesting to see it pulled off, but I'm not ready to install it.
1587700	1593060	I like my destroy ending, you know, that's Canon in my head.
1593060	1597680	It's very impressive to me that people can mod the ending and like that, that's like
1597680	1600740	a thing now to like mod the ending to make it the way you want.
1600740	1604860	And I'm just like, Oh my God, the new trilogy can't get here fast enough.
1604860	1606780	So people have something new to bitch about.
1606780	1611320	Well, the whole thing is, is it in theory, I know how it can be done cause really it
1611320	1616600	would be changing code to insert sequence for pre-rendered stuff and screens for all
1616600	1619920	of the little, uh, flashbacky things.
1619920	1626720	Um, and then it was, uh, uh, it would actually be taking preexisting animations and loading
1626720	1632580	different textures over them, which by the way, that picture of, of Jacob's face over
1632580	1636280	Garris's body is absolutely hilarious because he has his mouth expanded.
1636280	1638800	Like it was for the whole Garris face.
1638800	1640040	That sounds strange.
1640040	1641040	Very strange.
1641400	1644880	Have you ever seen them done for, um, smash brothers?
1644880	1645880	No.
1645880	1653120	The, uh, the, you can swap, uh, swap the textures and the different characters on, um, on, uh,
1653120	1654120	smash brothers.
1654120	1658660	And it changes the actual size and body shape of the character to where you have like a
1658660	1662160	Kirby with, you know, a princess peach with a huge mouth for Kirby.
1662160	1666680	Well, yeah, I saw that one, um, mod or whatever that Loki was talking about a couple of weeks
1666680	1671560	ago on the show that changed all the characters to other gaming franchise characters.
1671560	1672560	But that was it.
1672560	1673560	Yeah.
1673560	1677080	This, this is just like, you have a different frame for the animation, which in Mass Effect
1677080	1681800	is actually a lot easier because they all use a human skeleton, but, um, not so much
1681800	1683800	in, uh, smash brothers.
1683800	1688280	So anyway, uh, the Rob D in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says I'm over Mass
1688280	1689280	Effect 3.
1689280	1692880	There's too much else to enjoy to continue bitching about Mass Effect 3.
1692880	1694140	Ain't that the truth?
1694140	1700420	And a multiplayer is really great in Mass Effect 3 if it works well on Xbox.
1700420	1701420	It's been great.
1701420	1702420	All right.
1702420	1704940	Anyhow, uh, Loki, how was your gaming week?
1704940	1706300	Uh, it's basically Minecraft.
1706300	1708980	I mean, that's what I was doing most of the week.
1708980	1714920	I finally got the option to, um, switch the server to a bucket server, which is a server
1714920	1716220	that allows mods.
1716220	1717220	So that's what I did.
1717220	1719460	I have it running on a bucket server now.
1719460	1727100	So aside from the, uh, dynamap, um, thing that I talked about before, uh, we also have
1727100	1732180	now world edit, which is kind of cool for, you know, making, uh, structures and stuff
1732180	1735820	really fast and also for like leveling mountains and that kind of fun stuff.
1735820	1741860	So we have that and a mob arena, which I'm setting up right now, a, uh, a, uh, PVE arena
1741860	1747940	where you can fight waves and waves of monsters, just to kind of get a little bit of that survival
1747940	1752340	element in there, because right now we're just playing creative and it'd be fun just
1752340	1755580	to have something to do, you know, just take a break from building stuff.
1755580	1760400	You can fight waves of monsters and it's going to get really wacky because you can put like
1760400	1761400	anything you want in there.
1761400	1762780	Like you can make a boss monster.
1762780	1767680	That's a chicken that fight, no launches fireballs or like really crazy stuff.
1767680	1771780	So we've got, got a lot of work to do on that.
1771780	1777020	And then, um, I played a little bit of a call of duty this week and, uh, hopefully we'll
1777020	1782940	be playing black ops two in a couple of weeks here and that's pretty much it.
1782940	1785100	I think I haven't really played a whole ton this week.
1785100	1786100	Yeah.
1786100	1787100	I'm kind of in the same boat as you.
1787100	1788380	I haven't played a whole ton this week.
1788380	1791980	Um, uh, more world of Warcraft, which, you know, I'll talk about on Horde house, the
1791980	1796140	other show a little later this week, but a little preview, a followup for those of you
1796140	1799900	that do listen to Horde house, our guild did take down the first raid boss.
1799900	1800900	Finally.
1800900	1801900	Yay.
1801900	1802900	Puppies are dead.
1802900	1804820	And the trick was use three healers instead of two.
1804820	1808580	The minute we ran it with three healers, we had it down in three polls as opposed to like
1808580	1809900	the 20 before that.
1809900	1811900	So that was the trick.
1811900	1815900	Um, and then I did play some aspect three multiplayer, not to make this a mass effect
1815900	1819580	show, but they did have the Halloween challenge, which I thought was really cute because they
1819580	1824740	modded the game to make like the little, the little beacons turned into pumpkins and the
1824740	1828780	little devices that you did the upload from were all little pumpkins and you know, they
1828780	1829780	did that.
1829780	1832740	And then you had these certain little mini achievements that you get the new banner,
1832740	1835740	which I thought that was a pretty hefty reward because it's really hard and you have to play
1835740	1839100	a lot to get a lot of those banners, but the Halloween challenge unlocks a banner.
1839100	1841740	So I was like, Ooh, I want to get a banner for no particular reason.
1841740	1843280	My E P needs it.
1843280	1844280	So I did that.
1844280	1846900	So, um, yeah, that was the Halloween challenge.
1846900	1849420	Um, screw that Vanguard challenge though.
1849420	1853060	I'm not doing that one cause I don't really like Vanguards as much as all my friends seem
1853060	1854060	to.
1854060	1856220	And that was really it for games.
1856220	1857960	I didn't have a chance to play a lot of new stuff.
1857960	1862600	I will say I took a trip to Dave and busters yesterday cause I was in the Bay area hanging
1862600	1868280	with some of my friends and I went to Dave and busters and you know, I got to see like
1868280	1872320	that infinity blade arcade machine, which I didn't really play it.
1872320	1876320	You know, I didn't, Oh, this is the next next iPad.
1876320	1877320	Yeah.
1877320	1878320	Yeah.
1878320	1883000	I'm, I'm too addicted to, um, the wheel of fortune, which, and the, it's the quiz game.
1883000	1884000	It's that damn quiz game.
1884000	1887640	I don't know if every Dave and busters has it, but it's like the giant quiz machine with
1887640	1888640	the three buttons.
1888640	1891120	Oh, we just sit there and play that for like an hour.
1891120	1898160	Just keep putting the tickets in and, or the swipe in the card and um, I don't believe
1898160	1900040	they have a DDR machine anymore.
1900040	1901040	They didn't.
1901040	1902040	Well, Dave and busters never did.
1902040	1906160	They always only had pump it up, but they replaced it with a giant connect for machine.
1906160	1908640	That's like, it's like, Oh my God, the thing is so bright.
1908640	1910000	You can see it from space.
1910000	1911240	It's crazy.
1911240	1913720	So it's just connect for whatever.
1913720	1916920	I think the one by S has an X two.
1916920	1917920	Yeah.
1917920	1918920	Yeah.
1918920	1920600	They don't have pump.
1920600	1921600	I don't think.
1921600	1922600	Hmm.
1922600	1923600	Interesting.
1923600	1924600	But yeah, that was, that was really it for games.
1924600	1927520	I didn't really, um, I have 11,000 tickets at Dave and busters though.
1927520	1932000	I am really close to having enough for a PlayStation three game, a new one, although I almost bought
1932000	1935160	Alan a new grill and an indoor grill yesterday because I could have got one of those for
1935160	1936160	9,000 tickets.
1936160	1937160	You know what?
1937160	1939040	What I actually did use my tickets to buy appliances there.
1939040	1944560	Did you, I got, um, a, uh, rice cooker that I actually used to make quinoa in and it's
1944560	1945560	wonderful.
1945560	1946560	Nice.
1946560	1948560	Uh, Misty's asking me if this is the Dave and busters in Roseville.
1948560	1950080	No, I actually went over to the Bay area.
1950080	1954280	I went to the great mall in Milpitas cause we had to do outlet shopping cause I needed
1954280	1955640	new shoes.
1955640	1957120	But anyway, that's for another show.
1957120	1959160	Uh, so that was my gaming week.
1959160	1960360	Not a whole lot of new stuff.
1960360	1964720	Just a lot of old classics, uh, debating, picking up halo four this week though.
1964720	1968280	I got to admit, you know, I've skipped all the little halo side games.
1968280	1973000	I bought original halo, halo two, halo three, skipped all the side games.
1973000	1975720	Didn't think I'd buy halo four, but I don't know.
1975720	1977760	There's a part of me that's four is pretty awesome.
1977760	1978760	I don't want it.
1978760	1982720	I mean, see, that's the same way as I only played three was the last one I played, but
1982720	1985360	you got to figure, you know, reach in recon and all that stuff.
1985360	1989360	Those kind of like prequels type, you know, that I don't really think you need to play
1989360	1993320	that cause it's basically a sequel to three and if you play three then cool.
1993320	1994320	Yeah.
1994320	1995320	All right.
1995320	1996320	Yes.
1996320	1997560	Master chief wakes up after a long time.
1997560	1999480	I mean, that's pretty much kind of, it depends.
1999480	2002840	Well, a lot of it depends on what, what, what friends of mine are going to be playing halo
2002840	2007520	four because halo two was the best because I played it with my college buddies that,
2007520	2010000	you know, and this was a little bit after college and that game first came out and that
2010000	2013520	was kind of a, we would have our night that we would all play halo two and it was just
2013520	2014520	us, no strangers.
2014520	2018200	And we had a great time when I went to halo three, that kind of fell apart.
2018200	2024560	And so it was mostly strangers and halo three and I was kind of like, eh, eh, having my
2024560	2029280	ass handed to me by strangers isn't as much fun as when it's people, you know, you know,
2029280	2035720	uh, um, yeah, bonds bonds double six in our chat room says I just did halo one, two and
2035720	2037840	three never did the ODST in wars.
2037840	2038840	Yeah.
2038840	2039840	Same.
2039840	2040840	I'm in the same boat, buddy.
2040840	2042840	Uh, Raginator asked kind of a random question.
2042840	2046160	I'll answer this and then we'll go into, um, uh, housekeeping and news.
2046160	2051440	Um, Raginator asks, Rob, say, have you ever used the games for windows marketplace before?
2051440	2055440	I ask, cause I'm wondering if you can use Ms points on there or do you actually have
2055440	2057240	to use actual dollars and cents?
2057240	2060360	Um, maybe one of the other listeners can correct me.
2060360	2063400	I believe it's all dollars and cents on the marketplace.
2063400	2065940	I don't think they use the points.
2065940	2070400	The only games for windows, if I did download it to get that free game tinker or whatever
2070400	2075920	it was that was in there and when I was really into game room, you had to have games for
2075920	2079640	windows for the games that you bought that played on both platforms.
2079640	2082900	But that's really about my extent of knowledge of game for windows live.
2082900	2086280	So I don't know how the points work there.
2086280	2090680	I think Microsoft across the board is moving to regular currency.
2090680	2096500	I don't think you see the Microsoft points in the windows eight marketplace for instance.
2096500	2100000	So I think Microsoft transitioning away from that.
2100000	2104460	Um, although bonds double a six says I have used the games for windows and they will use
2104460	2105520	your Ms points.
2105520	2106520	So maybe I'm wrong.
2106520	2108840	I thought they were transitioning away from that though.
2108840	2113020	So maybe it's one of those do it while you can.
2113020	2117240	I'm sure though that if they do decide someday to just get rid of Microsoft points, they'll
2117240	2118240	convert you.
2118240	2120640	You can convert them somehow into like $80 to a dollar.
2120640	2121600	Exactly.
2121600	2122600	It won't be that difficult.
2122600	2125040	So I wouldn't worry too much about it.
2125040	2126040	Okay.
2126040	2130200	Um, quick housekeeping and then we'll get into tonight's news.
2130200	2134360	So um, we were going to have a interview tonight with Eddie from Bahmani style.
2134360	2135880	He needed to postpone that.
2135880	2139320	So if you did not see the message on Twitter, that interview will not be happening tonight.
2139320	2141560	I apologize if you were tuning in just for that.
2141560	2143440	I hope you'll enjoy the show anyway.
2143440	2144560	We are going to reschedule that.
2144560	2146320	I think we're doing it next week.
2146320	2148360	Uh, keep an eye on our Twitter for updates.
2148360	2150520	I will post as soon as I have that confirmed.
2150520	2154000	Twitter.com slash O L R um, real life things happen.
2154000	2158760	So at Eddie had to do something else tonight, but we will be welcoming him in a later week.
2158760	2163360	Uh, the other housekeeping thing I want to mention, as we mentioned in part B last week,
2163360	2169760	orange launch radio was nominated at the podcast awards, www.podcastawards.com for best gaming
2169760	2175560	podcast and we're, we're going to try really hard not to spam this like crazy.
2175560	2177880	We're limiting ourselves to once a day.
2177880	2180240	We're trying to be tasteful about it.
2180240	2185000	But you know, we really could use the support competition is going to be stiff, which, you
2185000	2191360	know, the good news is it seems like the indie broadcasts are the ones that really want it.
2191360	2194440	So an indie is probably going to win, which is great news.
2194440	2198040	Um, you know, because the Corp cast, they're like, Oh, what's this?
2198040	2199040	What's this little words?
2199040	2200040	Oh, Oh, we have money elsewhere.
2200040	2203080	Oh, we don't need to, so they don't even bother promoting it.
2203080	2206760	But you know, the Indies are, are really, I'm trying to get the vote and hopefully that's
2206760	2208680	a really good sign that one of them will win.
2208680	2212880	Of course, we would love to be the ones that win because it's great exposure.
2212880	2216640	And that's really, you know, why we're trying to get people to get out the vote for us because,
2216640	2219520	you know, because we don't have those big websites behind us.
2219520	2221500	We don't have a big marketing campaign.
2221500	2223560	We don't make money off this show.
2223560	2226880	It's just really a great way for us to leverage some promotion.
2226880	2233480	So remember, you can vote once a day between now and November 15th, www.podcastawards.com
2233480	2235560	and we are nominated in the best gaming category.
2235560	2239580	Don't forget, if you give them an email address, that's not one that you often check.
2239580	2243180	Be sure to check it once every 24 hours because you have to verify your vote because they
2243180	2245220	want to make sure you're a real person.
2245220	2250760	And please do not do anything that would get us disqualified by doing something shady.
2250760	2252320	So keep it legit.
2252320	2253920	Keep it real y'all.
2253920	2258040	And most importantly, even if you're not going to vote for OLR, please consider keeping it
2258040	2261080	indie because the indie podcasts need it.
2261080	2262080	All right.
2263080	2264880	What else do I want to say for housekeeping?

2282200	2283720	Loki, start us off.
2283720	2284800	All right.
2284800	2288560	So let's talk a little bit about 38 Studios.
2288560	2293800	I know everyone's familiar with the whole debacle with, you know, kingdoms of Amalur
2293800	2295440	reckoning and all that stuff.
2295440	2303640	Well now apparently the people that were behind the whole $75 million loan for 38 Studios
2303640	2308120	are being sued by Rhode Island.
2308120	2309480	And it's kind of interesting.
2309480	2313160	So they're actually going after, what was it?
2313160	2322040	It was, you know, Kurt Schilling and CEO Jennifer McLean.
2322040	2330840	And I guess also the former Economic Development Corporation Director Keith Stokes and Wells
2330840	2335080	Fargo Securities and Barclays Capital.
2335080	2337360	So Barclays used to own the company I worked for.
2337360	2338360	Yeah.
2338360	2339360	So they're going after them.
2339360	2344280	And they said, you know, I know you work hard for your paychecks and for your tax dollars
2344280	2346760	to be squandered is unacceptable.
2346760	2351320	The board's legal action was taken to rectify this grave injustice put upon the people of
2351320	2353120	Rhode Island.
2353120	2355400	And so, yeah.
2355400	2357640	So they're going after them for money.
2357640	2362880	And I don't know, hopefully they get it.
2362880	2364880	It's be interesting.
2364880	2368560	They're just trying to kind of recoup any losses that they had because they're out sending
2368560	2369960	$75 million right now.
2369960	2374080	You know, I'm not going to pretend to know the first thing about investment or like how
2374080	2377560	the money worked out in this whole mess.
2377560	2382040	So I am not going to be one of those pundits that's like, yeah, take them through the ring
2382040	2385440	or get them through all their worth or, you know, or the other extreme, because I really
2385440	2387080	just don't know.
2387080	2392880	I just find this shit fascinating that, you know, the state of Rhode Island is out this
2392880	2393880	money.
2393880	2396200	It's not some private company.
2397000	2404240	The state is out a large amount of money because of the failure of a video game company.
2404240	2406760	That just kind of blows my mind in a way.
2406760	2411580	It's really unfortunate because it would probably make people hesitant to invest in other video
2411580	2412580	game companies.
2412580	2417840	But I don't know, it just blows my mind.
2417840	2421000	The Rob D in chat says, Kurt Schilling will need to sell everything.
2421000	2424280	I feel bad for everyone involved.
2424280	2426560	Mack Deft follows that up with yeah.
2426560	2432080	And the Rob D follows that up at live.vognetwork.com says Kurt Schilling was an idiot, but he
2432080	2434440	didn't have evil intentions.
2434440	2438100	Dark Sakura followed that up with he'll need to sell $10 blow jobs.
2438100	2439100	Don't be immature.
2439100	2440100	Don't be immature.
2440100	2441100	Exactly.
2441100	2445200	To recoup those kind of losses, he's going to have to sell $100 blow jobs.
2445200	2450080	Well, I was just thinking $10 so that he'd actually get business.
2450080	2455240	The Rob D, again, some good comments in our chat room at live.vognetwork.com says he has
2455240	2457880	to pay for his idiocy though.
2457880	2461040	Actions have consequences.
2461040	2464560	Kurt Schilling was just trying to make a video game that ever, I mean, obviously he was a
2464560	2466900	big EverQuest fan, a big WoW fan.
2466900	2471120	He wanted to make that game, but probably, I mean, let's be real.
2471120	2472840	He was a baseball player.
2472840	2476560	He probably didn't really know what he was getting into.
2476560	2479760	I mean, it's kind of sad.
2479760	2485160	I don't think the game was that bad, but the thing is, it's just not a lot of games do.
2485160	2490360	Millions and millions of copies sold and to just count on your game being like a tent
2490360	2494040	pool AAA title, it's huge, huge, huge, huge.
2494040	2496380	It's not really realistic.
2496380	2501000	But the whole thing, all that being said, it blows my fucking mind that he was given
2501000	2502760	the money in the first place.
2502760	2507560	Because somebody wrote him that check.
2507560	2509920	Is it because of the sports fame?
2509920	2514680	Is it because we're so fixated on sports in this country that it's like, oh yeah, when
2514680	2518680	sports royalty walks in and wants to do something, we let them do it.
2518680	2520360	Is that what's to blame?
2520360	2522960	Is that sports royalty in our culture?
2522960	2528640	I'm pretty sure that in certain counties in California, like Hollywood and stuff like
2528640	2530760	that, you could probably kill a man and get away with it.
2530760	2533680	They give you a gimme and you know, that's it.
2533680	2536400	But so like, you know, it works for it works for OJ.
2536400	2537400	Yeah.
2537400	2538400	Say five million dollar loan.
2538400	2541600	I mean, that's that's like, ah, you're good for it.
2541600	2544640	You're a baseball star right now.
2544640	2549480	You know, there's no possible way we're going to lose on this.
2549480	2552240	S.H.O. 100 Matt in our chat says it was because he was Curt Schilling.
2552240	2553980	So you're saying I'm right?
2553980	2554980	Question mark.
2554980	2560240	Well, keep in mind, this is the same country that's letting a, you know, a convicted rapist
2560240	2569580	go free, you know, and is the director, the movie director, I what?
2569580	2573040	Nevermind that Paul W.S. Anderson, I swear.
2573040	2575120	All right.
2575120	2578200	And Tiger Cloth follows it up saying, yeah, it's got to be because he was a baseball player
2578200	2581560	and the fact he was a World Series winning baseball player.
2581560	2587420	So anyhow, let's just like no one give like, you know, basketball stars this kind of money
2587420	2592260	either for game ideas, because would they have given that money to Dennis Rodman?
2592260	2593660	We did have Shaq Fu.
2593660	2602300	Hey, I wonder if Shaq Fu sold as many copies, if not more copies, then, uh, yeah, at least
2602300	2604060	Shaq Fu recovered its costs.
2604060	2606180	Maybe Shaq Fu is a concept I can get behind.
2606180	2609460	Shaq Fu did not put Rhode Island seventy five million dollars.
2609460	2611340	Shaq Fu is harmless.
2611340	2612820	Well, pretty harmless.
2612820	2616460	Shaq Fu just put me seventy five minutes of my time into debt.
2616460	2617460	That's all.
2617460	2619060	It's not as big of a loss.
2619060	2622620	Oh, I remember the game I wanted to talk about during my gaming week before we get into this
2622620	2624860	next thing, since we're talking about basketball.
2624860	2626500	Do you know what I saw at the mall?
2626500	2629680	A demo kiosk for NBA baller beats.
2629680	2631900	And I so badly, that looked awkward.
2631900	2636100	I so badly wanted to play it, but I was with my friend Victoria and she was judging me
2636100	2637100	so hard.
2637100	2638100	Listen, you're too white for this.
2638100	2639280	You're too white for this.
2639280	2640700	You're not going to do that.
2640700	2641700	Basically.
2641700	2644780	And thanks to SSJ100 Matt, it was Roman Pileski.
2644780	2647140	Oh, that whole thing.
2647140	2648140	Oh, yeah.
2648140	2650620	That's that's a bit of a mess, isn't it?
2650620	2657220	Anyhow, NBA baller beats, I got to say, say what you will say what you would judge me
2657220	2658220	all you want.
2658220	2660280	I don't give a fuck.
2660280	2661280	It looked fun.
2661280	2662280	I'm sorry.
2662280	2664500	It looked fun.
2664500	2673420	I can get my boss to give me the copy that we have because it's just sitting there on
2673420	2674420	his desk.
2674420	2675620	I'm not going to lie.
2675620	2677900	I'm just waiting for it to go in the clearance bin.
2677900	2680060	I'm going to check much longer.
2680060	2681740	I'm going to check fries once a week.
2681740	2684260	It'll be a manager special before we know it.
2684260	2689940	They even have them for sale there like, nope, nope, nope.
2689940	2690940	All right.
2690940	2691940	Moving on.
2691940	2694140	Rhode Island's not the only one that's lost money.
2694140	2700700	Sony talking about their finances made a net loss of fifteen point five billion yen.
2700700	2706180	That translates to just under two hundred million dollars in their second fiscal quarter.
2706180	2709980	Their gaming division has seen a year on year decline in profit.
2709980	2714180	This is a year on year reduction in loss of forty two point six percent.
2714180	2717500	That's an improvement over the three hundred and twelve million dollars they lost during
2717500	2720700	the first quarter.
2720700	2725700	The company is lowered their projections for the end of the year for the PSP and the Vita
2725700	2727740	sales significantly.
2727740	2730140	That's down to ten million from what they originally projected.
2730140	2734380	I don't think they're going to come out too well this year, to be honest.
2734380	2739500	Kaz Hirai in May indicated a fiscal year estimate of ten million for the Vita alone.
2739500	2744920	The PS3 and the PS2 combined estimate remains untouched at sixteen million.
2744920	2750720	On the bright side, software performance saw slight growth across the second quarter.
2750720	2753660	So the PS3 and PS2 sales, they've actually rose slightly.
2753660	2756420	Well, let me just look at the fourth quarter line.
2756420	2758220	They don't really have any strong titles.
2758220	2761060	They have PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, which could flop.
2761060	2765640	I mean, it's all right, but it's not going to be like, you know, Uncharted or something
2765640	2766700	like that.
2766700	2769540	And they've got Little Big Planet Karting, which also could flop.
2769540	2774340	I mean, those are both like kind of mediocre, you know, as far as like Triple A titles go,
2774340	2777500	they're not like Mass Effect or Halo.
2777500	2781720	It's just kind of like, huh, you know, they'll do all right, but they're not going to be
2781720	2785840	these huge games that people are like, oh, my God, I'm going to line up at midnight to
2785840	2788400	go get my PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale.
2788400	2789400	That's a very good point.
2789400	2790400	That's a very good point.
2790400	2794780	These games are not Halo 4 or like that was that they have the new Sly Cooper game, Thieves
2794780	2798760	in Time around and one of those anyways.
2798760	2800360	So those aren't really that strong titles.
2800360	2803280	And look at what we have for the Vita, like the two big games that they've been kind of
2803280	2807880	pimping for the Vita was Call of Duty, Black Ops Classified, which I'm afraid is going
2807880	2808880	to suck.
2808880	2812020	In fact, I'm pretty sure it's going to suck because the guys that made it were the guys
2812020	2816380	that made the really shitty Resistance game that they were also pimping out really hard
2816380	2821420	and was very mediocre in Assassin's Creed, which I think Assassin's Creed Liberation
2821420	2822420	is actually pretty good.
2822420	2826820	But the Call of Duty game, the one that they're kind of banking on, you know, selling the
2826820	2829420	Vita, they even have bundles for it and stuff.
2829420	2831420	It's just it's going to be mediocre.
2831420	2833740	It's going to get poor reviews.
2833740	2835620	Here's the thing.
2835620	2840460	If Sony is losing this money and Sony is not really selling Vitas like they thought they
2840460	2844740	would, do we really think we're going to get a PlayStation 4 next year?
2844740	2846900	Do we still think that's something that's going to happen?
2846900	2851980	Because I'm I'm really starting to think a lot of this stuff that we're hearing about
2851980	2855100	game industry troubles, because this is not the first we've heard of this.
2855100	2857800	We've heard about layoffs, et cetera, et cetera.
2857800	2862580	Could this have the domino effect of maybe not having a new system or do it?
2862580	2865540	Does it make it more urgent that we need a new system to get us out?
2865540	2869980	I think if anything, I think we're going to have probably a new system soon, like as soon
2870020	2873860	as at the end of next year, because that's why we're seeing this kind of development
2873860	2874860	cycle.
2874860	2878720	We are seeing, you know, these games that are they're all right, but they're not like
2878720	2882380	these big, you know, launch tentpole titles or something like that.
2882380	2883380	It's like a new uncharted.
2883380	2888380	I mean, they have a new uncharted last year, but it's not like a big, huge title like that.
2888380	2893660	I think that they're having these dev teams working on something for the next system.
2893660	2898600	So they have a strong launch because they know they need that.
2898600	2899600	It's hard to say that.
2899720	2903880	I think that they're going to have to probably drop the price of the Vita pretty soon, because
2903880	2906720	there's not a whole ton of stuff that's really like a selling point.
2906720	2910520	Like had I not gotten one, there's not really anything that would have sold me on one.
2910520	2914120	Although if they announce a portable Grand Theft Auto 5 game, I'm probably going to have
2914120	2915400	to buy that.
2915400	2917080	Any Grand Theft Auto game, I probably have to buy.
2917080	2919280	I don't really care what system it's on.
2919280	2923340	YYYR in our chat room says, I played LittleBigPlanet Karting in New York Comic Con.
2923340	2924340	There were no lines.
2924340	2928840	It was actually quite fun, but I walked away thinking, will I pay $60 for this?
2928840	2929840	No.
2929840	2934800	Rob D says at live.vognetwork.com, we absolutely need a new system.
2934800	2937360	That said, we also need to reevaluate the game industry.
2937360	2941340	The problem is that companies only change things up when we get new systems.
2941340	2944700	You know, that's kind of along the same line I'm thinking of.
2944700	2948740	Not so much that we absolutely need a new system, but the whole, I don't know, I kind
2948740	2952640	of think the PS3's potential hasn't really been realized.
2952640	2958000	Because the PS3 does 3D gaming, but is that really a thing that people are doing right
2958000	2959000	now?
2959000	2960000	No.
2960000	2962680	So what is the PS4 going to bring us that the PS3's not doing?
2962680	2965840	You have to understand, they've already kind of gotten away from trying to promote 3D as
2965840	2966840	like a big thing now.
2966840	2969520	It's like they don't even really mention it too much anymore.
2969520	2973280	And even with 3D TVs, people aren't really sold on 3D TVs, so now they're pushing that
2973280	2976920	whole 4K, you know, the Ultra HD TV.
2976920	2979760	So is that going to be the PlayStation 4's big thing?
2979760	2980760	Yeah, they want.
2980760	2981760	Ultra HD?
2981760	2982760	Yeah.
2982760	2986040	I think that was one of the rumored specs, is it was going to do that 4K resolution thing.
2986080	2991280	But if the PlayStation 3 couldn't get people to adopt 3D successfully, although, okay,
2991280	2997400	to be fair, to be fair, Blu-ray probably won in large part to the PlayStation 3.
2997400	2998400	Yeah.
2998400	2999400	Yeah.
2999400	3004040	So, I mean, for every maybe failure, you could say that there's been a win, but I'm just
3004040	3008360	not convinced that like people are going to be like, oh, I need this PlayStation 4 right
3008360	3009360	fucking now.
3009360	3016240	Oh, and I need a new Sony Ultra HD TV as well to play what?
3016240	3020440	Because you can think that any games that are coming out at launch are probably just
3020440	3025880	going to be, they're probably not going to be utilizing that.
3025880	3027720	One more, let me do one more comment here from chat.
3027720	3029440	The chat's got a lot of good points tonight.
3029440	3034160	YYR says, I really think that smartphones and the sort of success of the 3DS have killed
3034160	3035920	the Vita's potential market.
3035960	3039600	I really think it's a great system and I'm really enjoying the game library despite its
3039600	3040600	small size.
3040600	3045840	But how many people want one if they have smartphones, a 3DS or both?
3045840	3047720	I don't even touch my DS at all.
3047720	3049200	I play on my phone.
3049200	3051920	You know, I would argue that the 3DS is kind of hurting too.
3051920	3054640	I mean, we're hearing a very similar story out of Nintendo.
3054640	3059520	It might not be as dire, but Nintendo's lowered expectations of 3DS sales as well.
3059520	3065900	So, but I do think you're onto something that a lot of it has to do with tablets, smart
3065900	3071580	phones, which is why when you bring out your device and you say it plays Netflix, like
3071580	3074300	that was a waste of breath.
3074300	3081820	The fact that your device, Wii U, plays Netflix is like, that's, that's an expectation now.
3081820	3085780	That's like, that's as much of an expectation of it does widescreen.
3085780	3087580	It does HD.
3087580	3088980	It does Netflix.
3088980	3090900	That's like a baseline thing now.
3090900	3100580	So what makes your device better than a tablet or a smartphone that, you know, far more people
3100580	3102220	have in their pockets and so forth?
3102220	3105060	I think that's a big part of it too.
3105060	3108100	iPad mini ain't gonna help.
3108100	3109100	I can be honest.
3109100	3116700	I mean, like I've got a smartphone and I have an iPod touch, you know, 4G and I don't really
3116700	3119860	use either of them for gaming.
3119860	3120860	Just don't.
3120860	3124780	Even like my portable systems, I'm kind of reevaluating whether I even need portable
3124780	3127700	gaming systems because I don't travel that much.
3127700	3131220	I don't really play portable games on it.
3131220	3135700	I mean, granted, you know, they're, they're talking about getting rid of our game room
3135700	3140540	again because they're consolidating space and buildings and stuff, so they can lease
3140540	3141540	out the other building.
3141540	3147500	But you know, we used to play on the PSP because it was portable and we could get a group of
3147500	3150300	people together and play Grand Theft Auto and stuff.
3150300	3155900	So you know, that may be a case where, yeah, I'd want a system like that to play like,
3155900	3160140	you know, Grand Theft Auto or some multiplayer game so that we can kind of move around and
3160140	3162860	stuff, be a little bit nomadic.
3162860	3168260	But I, it's just, I don't find the need to have that stuff anymore, it seems like.
3168260	3173460	Even like with all the systems, I don't really feel the need next generation to own all of
3173460	3174460	the systems.
3174460	3177900	I mean, granted, that's just be, you know, even before it felt like kind of this expectation
3177900	3180260	because I do this show, oh, I should own all of them.
3180260	3183780	I'm not really feeling it anymore because I don't play the Wii at all.
3183780	3187300	The Wii is literally collecting dust, I have something stacked on top of it and that was
3187300	3188300	it.
3188300	3192100	We, you know, we dusted off the other day just to play Sight Truck, I should say my
3192100	3193220	wife did.
3193220	3197980	But like I haven't played anything on that for years now.
3197980	3202540	And the PlayStation 3, same thing, like we're looking at maybe using the PlayStation 3 for
3202540	3206000	Grand Theft Auto 5 because it doesn't get disconnected through our firewalls quick,
3206000	3210840	but I haven't played anything on that for like a long time.
3210840	3213080	Jamie, quick thought.
3213080	3217140	Well, I was just saying I haven't really, I mean, Dan and I have actually talked about
3217140	3223400	downsizing our collection, you know, because really it's anything that we've wanted to
3223400	3230520	play, I can get on my PC and I can upgrade my PC at any point.
3230520	3234320	It just really isn't, you know.
3234320	3239160	And the other thing too is also looking in terms of the economy, people I think, this
3239160	3244040	has been the case for us, are really looking at needs versus wants.
3244040	3247760	A gaming system is a want, it's not something you need.
3247760	3253040	We need to pay rent and that became the priority, you know.
3253040	3256080	I didn't have, I wasn't working at the time.
3256080	3260800	Any of my money couldn't go towards games, it went towards buying food, paying bills,
3260800	3261800	you know.
3261800	3262800	And in this case-
3262800	3263800	Damn responsibility, damn it.
3264280	3268880	Well, yeah, but if you look at it, the vast majority of people have been put into the
3268880	3273680	circumstances instead of having disposable income, they're realizing that, yeah, maybe
3273680	3275120	I don't need this stuff.
3275120	3277280	Maybe it's just a bonus.
3277280	3278720	Let me read a few more comments from chat.
3278720	3283320	We'll end on these chat comments and go on into Dark Sakura's next story, but there's
3283320	3284960	such a good discussion going on in chat tonight.
3284960	3287960	I just got to throw these out there for the podcast listeners to hear.
3287960	3292640	YYR says, the 3DS can also fall back on Nintendo's excellent software.
3292640	3294120	Don't forget Pokemon.
3294120	3298920	We haven't really had, the Pokemon games just came out or for the last DS, which is fascinating.
3298920	3301960	That's how confident that they were that those games are going to do well in the 3DS.
3301960	3303800	And they're probably right, to be fair.
3303800	3308240	Dungeon Buster says, Sony's definitely thinking ahead to make the hardware flexible enough
3308240	3314280	to adapt to what the next technologies might be, 8K televisions, virtual glasses, et cetera.
3314280	3318060	Though most of the concepts are high up there, some techies are suggesting that the next
3318060	3323700	PlayStation 4 might even use through silicon via for the processor architecture.
3323700	3327220	I'm not sure, I think I butchered that sentence there, but you know, just the whole thinking
3327220	3328220	ahead point.
3328220	3333300	And lastly, Doom Plague says, I would be surprised if anyone made a 4K resolution game in the
3333300	3334820	next 10 years.
3334820	3337860	It's a non-factor this coming generation.
3337860	3343000	All right, we could talk about this for a lot longer, but I think this discussion is
3343000	3347480	going to be continuing through the next six months, right on up to the next E3, when we
3347480	3351240	know what these systems, if they're coming at all for one, and what they will entail.
3351240	3353600	In the meantime, let's go to Dark Soccer with the next story.
3353600	3357200	How about a tale of some corporate fucking greed?
3357200	3360600	Yay!
3360600	3366600	Frank Christopher Oliveira, who is the former GameStop VP of Corporate Communications and
3366600	3373640	Public Affairs, got caught, pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud for embezzling
3373640	3379080	$1,965,900 from GameStop.
3379080	3385440	And in the indictment, he sent payments from January 2009 through April 2011 to Cloud Communications
3385440	3393080	LLC, which was a fictitious company he owned, to transfer funds into his personal account.
3393080	3399820	So yeah, basically GameStop is like no comment, however they are fully cooperating with the
3399820	3402560	federal investigation.
3402560	3408480	And yeah, he actually, he pleaded not guilty, and the max sentence to this is 20 years in
3408480	3412240	prison and $250,000 fine.
3412240	3416440	And I hope that he gets the max, you know, penalty.
3416440	3421580	I wish that all of these corporate bastards who steal money from the companies they work
3421580	3427580	for and get away with, you know, fraud and stealing money out of the consumer's pockets
3427580	3432400	get caught too, instead of being given, you know, personhood and all this bullshit.
3432400	3433720	That's what I'm saying.
3433720	3435200	People need to be held accountable.
3435200	3440020	Funny enough, it would only take capturing about, what, about 35 more guys like this
3440020	3443120	guy for Rhode Island to get their money back.
3443120	3444440	Yeah.
3444440	3452160	It's just another, another sign of how, you know, people in positions of power and companies
3452160	3455400	are really abusing their positions.
3455400	3460560	And in return, you know, who has to pay for, you know, recouping those losses?
3460560	3463420	It goes back to the consumer when they're figuring out their money's missing.
3463420	3467540	Rama makes a very tongue-in-cheek comment in our chat room, but it's worth repeating.
3467540	3468540	Steal from GameStop?
3468540	3470800	Sure, they've stolen from me enough times.
3470800	3477280	Yeah, but this is, you know, a guy who probably already is a millionaire.
3477280	3482780	You have to remember, this is a guy who was feeding money that they already got from you
3482780	3485560	into these fake companies and what have you.
3485560	3486560	Yeah.
3486560	3487560	It's just amazing.
3487560	3488640	He was able to do that much.
3488640	3490480	I want them to nail his ass to the wall.
3490480	3495600	I, I want these, and it goes back to a bigger problem.
3495600	3502000	It goes back, you know, to more people looking at their own personal greed as opposed to,
3502000	3503560	you know, being a better person maybe.
3503560	3505360	Are you saying look at your life, look at your choices?
3505360	3507440	Yeah, look at your life, look at your choices.
3507440	3508440	Don't be a corporate douche-head.
3508440	3509440	All right.
3509440	3510440	Fair enough.
3510440	3512440	Loki, let's move on.
3512440	3513440	All right.
3513440	3518060	Um, so let's talk a little bit about one game I'm very looking forward to, and that would
3518060	3519680	be Grand Theft Auto V.
3519680	3520680	And of course-
3520680	3522680	Since when were you a Grand Theft Auto fan?
3522680	3523680	I know, I just-
3523680	3525200	You're just getting on the bandwagon.
3525200	3527480	It's been a long time.
3527480	3532040	But I'm gearing up because this month is going to be a lot of news for Grand Theft Auto V.
3532040	3534800	I bet you suddenly became a Giants fan last week too.
3534800	3539240	Yeah, I had to become a sports fan first, and so that's not going to happen.
3539240	3542680	Grand Theft Auto V, of course, there was a whole bunch of rumors of when it is expected
3542680	3543680	to come out.
3543680	3546340	I've already said that it's going to be April and May next year, but they've officially
3546340	3550020	confirmed that yes, Spring 2003 is going to be the release window for the game, and
3550020	3556780	they added some promotional materials that are making it out to GameStops and other places,
3556780	3559620	including game and stuff internationally.
3559620	3566140	And along with that, some of the promotional stuff, starting on Monday, November 5th, you
3566140	3569980	can actually pre-order the game from different locations.
3569980	3574420	The rumor was that they were supposed to be doing another trailer on the 5th, although
3574420	3578940	because of the whole hurricane slash storm, it's put them a little bit behind as far as
3578940	3584140	getting that trailer cut, so expect the trailer next week, which I'm really expecting for
3584140	3585260	next week.
3585260	3590700	And they've got some cool little promotional items if you're able to pre-order your game
3590700	3594180	early enough, because it's going to be extremely limited in supplies.
3594180	3597820	You can get a keychain type thing that has almost like a little viewfinder on there,
3597820	3602540	and you can check out some of the locations, including they've got Vinewood Hills, which
3602540	3613580	is like Hollywood, the Del Perro Pier, like Santa Monica, the Vespucci Canals, I guess
3613580	3617100	that's, looks like kind of like a downtown LA.
3617100	3618380	Sounds a little dirty.
3618380	3621980	Grapeseed, which is kind of like Napa.
3621980	3623700	Oh boy.
3623700	3624700	So it looks interesting.
3624700	3625700	I mean, they kind of show some-
3625700	3626940	Because Napa's so close to LA.
3626940	3632260	Whatever, you know, it's just like, well, San Andreas, they had San Francisco, Vegas,
3632260	3635420	and you know, I know, I know, it's a video game.
3635420	3636420	It's all fixed.
3636420	3637420	It's all fictitious anyways.
3637420	3638420	Right, right.
3638420	3642020	And then they've got new posters and stuff like that with like a Lindsay Lohan looking
3642020	3647140	woman on the front there, prostitute, I don't know, it's hard to tell what, which it is.
3647140	3652700	So yeah, it's pretty awesome, and hopefully we'll learn a little bit, well, definitely
3652700	3657100	a lot more this month, because it's the cover game for the new Game Informer, which is gonna
3657100	3661900	be the December issue, which is coming out in any time now, like a couple weeks, and
3661900	3668620	also kind of their launch of their whole media campaign, so very excited.
3668620	3671620	Trying to take your mind off of some of the holiday games that are coming out right now.
3671620	3673260	I'm looking forward to spring.
3673260	3676420	Well, I'm only picking, the last game I'm picking up this, well, actually I should say
3676420	3679380	not the last game, but the second to last game I'm picking up this year is Black Ops
3679380	3685300	2, followed by Far Cry 3, so those would be the last two games I'm getting, and then maybe
3685300	3687260	Halo 4, I don't know, we'll see.
3687260	3691340	Well there are gonna be a lot of people picking up Halo 4 this week, believe it or not, it's
3691340	3695180	here, because, you know, the election day is this week, and it's the same day Halo 4
3695180	3699940	is being released, and retailers everywhere are gonna be doing midnight releases, Game
3699940	3704760	Stop is one of those retailers, they did announce this week 4,400 of their US locations will
3704760	3708500	be open at midnight to sell Halo 4.
3708500	3712620	All the stores that are participating in the event will start their events at 9 o'clock
3712620	3714540	in the local time zone.
3714540	3719440	Do keep in mind, if you're in an area that was impacted by Hurricane Sandy, that may
3719440	3723120	have screwed up some of these Game Stops, there's still a lot of places without power,
3723120	3727900	so when in doubt, call ahead, and just make sure.
3727900	3732480	Probably if your store did Assassin's Creed 3, it's probably doing Halo 4, but you know,
3732480	3735440	it's always best to just call ahead, there's nothing wrong with placing a phone call.
3735440	3740140	The store that you've pre-ordered your game happens to be a plan trade, you're not getting
3740140	3741140	it at midnight.
3741140	3747160	Alrighty then, well, I do want to point out, you know, even though Game Stop, they're most,
3747160	3750880	there's probably a shit ton of other retailers doing the midnight release as well.
3750880	3757560	I'm sure Walmarts, Best Buys, probably, you know, basically any place that sells video
3757560	3763320	games will probably be open at midnight, because Halo 4 is kind of a big deal.
3763320	3768640	Now, one other thing I want to talk about with Halo 4, is this interesting little report
3768640	3775380	that's going around the internet this week, 343 Industries apparently not happy with some
3775380	3781220	of the language that players use when they're playing Halo, to which I say, good, make the
3781220	3783540	shit talkers take some accountability.
3783540	3789500	The studio head of 343 Industries, Bonnie Ross, in an interview with GameSpot said,
3789500	3794380	quote, I've seen many of the sites that have documented some of the more gender-specific,
3794380	3796060	slanderous comments.
3796060	3800420	This is behavior that is offensive and completely unacceptable.
3800420	3805420	I'd like to think most of our Xbox Live players don't support this kind of behavior.
3807860	3809300	What are you laughing about out of there?
3809300	3810900	Just like most of them.
3814540	3819900	Executive producer, Kiki Wolfkill said that when the best name ever, that actually is an
3819900	3825340	awesome name, when you give adolescents a way to broadcast opinions anonymously, that can be
3825340	3829460	dangerous, to which I say no shit, but it's nice to see, you know, companies acknowledging
3829460	3834540	that, the nasty side of the teenage mind will manifest itself in that environment.
3834540	3842300	Microsoft will do its best to seek out and ban anybody that is sharing really, really bad
3842300	3842940	stuff.
3842940	3850380	I'm assuming talking about someone's charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent, but in a more
3850380	3853260	hateful way, right?
3853260	3854980	I don't know how they do it, though.
3854980	3859220	I'm assuming you've got to report people or it's got to be in messages or something
3859220	3863020	intractable because Microsoft can't exactly monitor live games, can they?
3863940	3866780	Well, I'm sure they have maybe.
3867140	3867860	Yeah, they might.
3867860	3868420	I don't know.
3868420	3872340	They do have patents for that kind of stuff.
3872340	3877220	And if you remember correctly, you know, not necessarily Microsoft, but EA with Kinect and
3877220	3877900	stuff like that.
3877900	3880940	They had a kind of similar feature in FIFA.
3882020	3886300	Now, I read this story at Destructoid, Destructoid.com, and they bring up a really good
3886300	3887860	point that I think is worth repeating.
3887860	3892060	They take issue with the fact that adolescents are the only ones being targeted as being
3892060	3893140	jerks online.
3893620	3898300	And they say in this article, quote, Unfortunately, there are plenty of full grown adults
3898420	3903100	who get their jollies by going into online games and being nasty or who attempt to bully
3903100	3904820	others because of perceived differences.
3905100	3906580	I think that's a damn good point.
3906620	3911180	Wasn't there a story around the Internet this week or maybe last week about the Reddit
3911180	3915660	trolls and the people posting the really, really bad stuff to Reddit?
3915740	3920660	And they traced it back to some thirty nine year old guy, you know, just one of your
3920660	3924500	stereotypical basement going people with nothing better to do.
3924500	3926900	And it bears to be repeated.
3927500	3930180	Halo four is a fucking mature rated game.
3930500	3933100	So kids shouldn't be playing in the first place.
3933100	3937820	But parents are fucking dumb or I should say parents have made the choice to have their
3937820	3939660	kids play this mature rated game.
3939660	3944700	At that same time, they should also be responsible for what they say or what they're
3944700	3945660	exposed to.
3947100	3951660	Bonds double six in our chat room says people still cry over what's being said online in
3951660	3956540	a game. I'm not sure if I'm taking that, like if there's like a hint of sarcasm or
3956540	3960540	something to that comment. But like, yes, and people should take issue to some of the
3960540	3962140	things that are said online in a game.
3962300	3968580	Like, I'm sorry, I've been in Halo matches where I've heard people called faggot and far
3968580	3970620	worse words I'm not going to say on this show.
3970820	3973380	And although they're all bad, let's be real.
3973540	3977340	But it's just like, you know, yes, I take issue to that.
3977740	3983580	You know, as a gay guy who got called that a lot growing up in a very malicious way, who
3983580	3988980	you know, still has many emotional scars, for lack of a better word, with that shit.
3989180	3992700	Yeah, I take issue with the fact that somebody is projecting that shit onto somebody
3992700	3999460	else. And those people should have the privilege of playing an online game taken away
3999460	4002860	from them. Yes, you pay for Xbox Live.
4002980	4008300	But you also accept the terms of service that you won't generally be a dickbag when you
4008300	4012220	play online. And if you fail to live up to the terms of service, then you should have it
4012220	4013060	taken away.
4013580	4015660	I don't like playing with cockbags online.
4016020	4019260	There's been a lot of nice people I've met playing online, especially in playing Mass
4019260	4020740	Effect, because a lot of that's co-ops.
4020740	4022100	You don't have that same mentality.
4022380	4028940	But, you know, and I think if you are going to call a girl who's brave enough to go on to
4028940	4034980	the game and talk in the first place, if you're going to call her the big C-bomb, then,
4036340	4040820	you know, that better be a term of endearment or some prearranged thing and not in a
4040820	4046580	negative thing, because that's not OK to be calling women at random that word.
4046900	4052540	You know what I mean? Or even, you know, bitch, whore, slut, all those other things.
4053580	4054260	Right, Jamie?
4055100	4056300	I'm kind of not bothered.
4057300	4062060	So you don't care if you go online into a random match on Halo 4 and somebody drops the
4062060	4062540	C-bomb?
4063300	4068660	No, I mean, because really all I'll do, like, for example, it actually happened in a while,
4068660	4072060	not too long ago, and all I did was just report and put them on ignore.
4072100	4072780	What about my game?
4073820	4079700	Well, OK, then it didn't get like get under your skin, but you recognize that, hey, this
4079700	4082980	person should probably have their freedom to play the game taken away from them.
4083260	4085220	Right. This person is not mature enough to be in this game.
4085300	4088260	Their ability to speak in said game should be revoked.
4089300	4093540	I don't necessarily think they shouldn't be allowed to play the game because, you know,
4093540	4095500	maybe they're good at it.
4095900	4098660	I just think that their ability to speak should be revoked.
4099260	4103620	I mean, because that's almost more frustrating as not being able to say something to
4103620	4110980	somebody. And, you know, honestly, I like when you have a feature to just actively
4111020	4117460	ignore something and then have it pop up, reverting to them, X person has you ignored.
4118820	4123180	Then what good is saying anything going to do when the person that you're saying it at
4123540	4125460	can't react, isn't going to react to it?
4125740	4127860	The people are only doing that for attention.
4128180	4130820	They're only doing that because they get something off on it.
4131100	4134580	If you're not, if they're not bothered by it, what good is it going to do?
4135260	4139700	I seem to remember Halo 3 had a really quick way to block people like that.
4139700	4144180	Like, I remember reporting on some of the stories that, you know, you could just hit
4144180	4148740	like the back button and it just shut them up automatically, which I thought was pretty
4148740	4148980	neat.
4149980	4151060	That's what I think it should be.
4151060	4155700	But I think that they also need to get the feedback in return that this person isn't
4155700	4156620	paying attention to you.
4157220	4162180	I don't think that they should, because actually it's better if they don't know that
4162180	4164060	because then they can't go, oh, you're not going to listen to me.
4164060	4165460	I'm going to send an angry message at you.
4165460	4167740	I mean, no, it should completely block them.
4170100	4174260	TheRobD, I think this is a very interesting point in chat, just want to throw this out
4174260	4179860	there, live.vognetwork.com, TheRobD says, the only way we can improve the quality and
4179860	4184500	diversity of gamers online is to hold them accountable for what they do.
4185020	4186740	I agree with holding them accountable.
4187100	4193900	The one problem that I'm running into with this is the fact that there's so much gray
4193900	4195700	area for offensive.
4196580	4203100	I mean, having a certain list, yeah, that's one thing, you know, going too far, it
4203100	4204500	definitely hold people accountable.
4204500	4211180	But I'm saying that it's kind of hard for me to try to think of how to phrase it.
4211820	4216300	There are really thin skinned people out there who, you know, even just saying, oh,
4216300	4218900	you suck is going to piss them off.
4219420	4223300	You know, it's going to make them, you know, be in a world of boohoo.
4223340	4226060	And maybe if they're that thin skinned, they shouldn't play.
4226900	4228620	I kind of I think I see what you're getting at.
4228740	4234980	You're saying that, you know, maybe this opens the door to that total political
4234980	4238500	correctness, hypersensitivity, these types of issues.
4238500	4240460	It's like, where do you draw the line?
4240580	4246700	I mean, I think we can all agree you don't say certain words ever, you know, online.
4246940	4253700	But, you know, somebody who might be ultra religious, grew up in Little House on the
4253700	4258500	Prairie, has every right to play the same Xbox games you do, but would never say the
4258500	4261300	word damn themselves and might take offense to that.
4261580	4267260	Yeah, I know people who like a lady in one of my classes who is as Mormon as Mormon can
4267260	4269220	be, doesn't drink coffee, none of that.
4269420	4271140	And she's perfectly fine with other people.
4271220	4275340	She doesn't, you know, she doesn't go la la la la la when someone says crap, you know.
4275820	4278380	But at the same time, she won't do that thing herself.
4278620	4283780	And she won't put herself in a position to where she's surrounded by it all the time.
4284220	4287180	And now if she's in a situation that she can't get away from, she understands and
4287180	4291220	accepts that that's a situation she can't get away with it, get away from it.
4291220	4291820	You know what I mean?
4292220	4298660	And my big problem, and this is actually sort of goes back to the whole big political
4298660	4299940	correctness thing.
4299940	4300580	You know what I mean?
4301540	4308700	Is that there are people who do take shit way too seriously.
4308980	4312300	Now, there's just some people who, you know, maybe in a moment of frustration, they're
4312300	4314500	like, well, well, shit, you suck.
4314500	4316220	You know, I'm just using something, you know.
4316340	4322620	I've heard Dan drop a C-bomb at a game and then he will stop and go, oh, my God, I
4322620	4324420	didn't mean to say that, you know.
4326060	4327500	But here's the question.
4327500	4332140	Did he say it in frustration to an NPC, the verbal equivalent of throwing the
4332140	4333540	controller out the window?
4333780	4337020	Or did he actually press the push to talk button and call somebody?
4337540	4338620	He doesn't do that.
4338620	4339460	Dan is a lot.
4339460	4343420	Yeah, he'll go, oh, that was a fucking shit move.
4343420	4346700	You know, when he's playing on, he plays Borderlands with his with his buddies.
4347140	4351420	But I mean, the point with it is that I think there's a very.
4351420	4360860	I'm trying to think of how to, there is a lot of room for.
4363700	4366500	Oversensitizing things, you know what I mean?
4366540	4372620	There would be opportunity to take action against somebody that you don't like for
4372620	4378780	other reasons, like taking advantage of it to get somebody punished just because you
4378780	4380780	want to punish for something that has nothing to do with the game.
4380940	4381380	Right.
4381380	4383780	If it was going to if it was going to be.
4386180	4387740	I would rather have a strike rule.
4388380	4390420	I'm going to go way back and go to DDR Freak.
4391740	4392300	We had.
4392300	4394420	You think the nine point system should be universal?
4395220	4396020	Explain the system.
4396020	4396660	Explain the system.
4396940	4402300	We had a nine point rule, which basically for horrible offenses, then, yeah, they
4402300	4403980	would get docked three points.
4403980	4406740	And it was a three strike, three really bad offenses.
4406740	4410100	And yeah, they got banned after nine points.
4411020	4416060	But if there were very minor offenses, like, you know, maybe something that was
4416060	4420060	mildly inflammatory or maybe unintentionally flaming, you know, then,
4420060	4423300	yeah, they got like basically a one point warn for it.
4423700	4428020	And I don't think that it was the warnings that could go like a person could bring
4428020	4431260	something to my attention as a moderator and then make a judgment call.
4431260	4436540	If I got five things about one person from the same person, I'd only warn once
4436700	4439340	because clearly there's something more going on.
4439740	4443820	And if it seems like it's legit, I'll do the full three point warning for all five
4443820	4444380	offenses.
4444380	4447860	You know, that example, that was my mentality towards it.
4448700	4454980	When, when you're going into, you know, if you say that you've got somebody who's
4454980	4460940	really oversensitive playing their first round of Halo 4 forever and someone, you
4460940	4467780	know, just lets out, you know, oh, that was fucking cheap or, you know, makes one
4467820	4470940	statement, oh, you don't know how to play, you know, I'm going mild with it.
4471260	4475740	And that person gets really butthurt and says, oh, you said something offensive to
4475740	4480620	me, you know, even in the case of constructive criticism, because I've seen
4480620	4484700	people in WoW when you try to give them feedback on how they're playing and they
4484700	4486020	go completely off on you.
4486020	4488460	Don't tell me how to fucking play my character, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
4488740	4491900	When really the person was just giving really good constructive feedback.
4492660	4496260	You know, maybe you're having an off day to say, I'm having off night, but there's
4496260	4499220	people who take constructive criticism the wrong way too.
4499620	4505340	It's, it's really, you know, what I'm meaning about a really gray area is that
4505380	4509420	when you've got so many variables of personality involved with it, you're
4509420	4513020	running into a problem and you are running into people who are just going to
4513020	4516380	be, you know, hypersensitive.
4516420	4520380	There's people like that in the world, people who do not, who will take offense
4520380	4524300	to any little thing and go on a fucking rampage trying to prove that they're
4524340	4529020	right. If, if you know what I mean, you know, that's why we have so many stupid,
4529060	4532340	you know, lawsuits go into effect, you know, violent video game laws.
4532340	4537060	All this is we have a quite a bit of hypersensitivity going on.
4540180	4545500	I, I'm really trying to get how, now, I mean, if you've got someone who, yeah,
4545820	4549100	they've dropped the C-bomb, you know, three different times in one game and
4549100	4552100	everyone's put out the warning on them, ban them.
4552900	4556180	If it's with their buddies and their buddies are doing it to warn each of their
4556180	4559140	buddies, they get booted from the game for an hour, they get a certain number of
4559140	4560740	warrants, they're gone forever.
4562460	4563700	Give them a three strikes.
4565380	4567500	The DDR freak system should be applied everywhere.
4568020	4569140	I think it was wise.
4569140	4572300	The one thing, the one part you missed, if you were, if you were good, you would
4572300	4573660	start to lose points every month.
4573900	4579700	Right. Yeah. And, but that honestly, I actually did see that starting to really
4580260	4583380	benefit. And I never, ever got a point ever.
4583820	4588500	I can fix that now. No, not when they're dead, dead and gone.
4588540	4592740	Not when they're dead. But, but my, my point is that, you know, if you've got
4592740	4597700	someone who's having a really shitty day and they go off on someone, yeah, they
4597700	4599980	should be held accountable for going off on somebody.
4600300	4604940	But if they realize, oh, I see this is going to be something that's gonna, you
4604980	4610860	know, catch up with me later, then definitely give them an opportunity to
4610860	4612180	amend their behavior.
4613020	4616780	If they don't amend their behavior, knock them out.
4616820	4619460	Don't even give, you know, a number of how many warnings you have.
4619500	4620660	Don't advertise that shit.
4621020	4623140	Don't advertise that your points will drop off.
4623740	4628100	Just say you get a certain amount of warning again, you're dropped.
4628820	4630100	You know, it is up to us.
4630140	4631220	We can give you one strike.
4631220	4632500	We can give you three strikes.
4632860	4634300	It depends on what we see.
4635020	4637580	All right, well, gosh, we get to keep talking about this where we've had a lot
4637580	4638540	of good discussions tonight.
4638540	4639260	What's up with this?
4639260	4643220	This is supposed to be a slow news week, live.vognetwork.com.
4643260	4647500	We could, again, keep this topic going forever, but, uh, we do want to end, you
4647500	4650220	know, some point tonight instead of tomorrow morning.
4650220	4652060	So we're going to keep moving on in the interest of time.
4652300	4653900	So why don't we, they were right about DancerRx.
4654140	4654420	Why?
4654500	4654820	Yeah.
4655100	4656620	Why don't we go to that next story, Darcyra?
4657700	4658060	Okay.
4658060	4662580	Well, if God, if my voice comes back, um, there, I'm sure I've told the story
4662620	4666820	before about my copy of Descent that I used to have that came on 14 disks.
4667740	4669060	And yes, I sat and installed.
4669060	4670500	That was the way to play.
4671500	4677660	I have a good friend named Avery who had a chair that he put two controllers on
4677980	4679900	and a five, a 10 key pad.
4680100	4682020	Did he invent mailing labels that go in the printer?
4682020	4682540	Shut up.
4683540	4685540	And, um, hearts, hearts, hearts.
4686020	4690260	Um, and he had his, bitch, please.
4690780	4695980	Now, and, uh, he had, uh, his, uh, Descent chair.
4696020	4697060	That was the big thing.
4697380	4701460	Well, the reason why I'm bringing up all this Descent nostalgia is because there's
4701460	4708340	a modder going by the name of Max, who is recreating Descent using Unreal Engine 3
4708340	4709820	using the Unreal development kit.
4710820	4715060	And, um, the big thing about this is basically he's going sort of the path of
4715060	4721780	Black Mesa, um, where it's called Descent to UDK, where it's not exactly a remake,
4721780	4726100	but it's going to bring in the original story with some embellishments.
4726100	4731460	He's basically trying to diversify the original gameplay and, um, emphasize the,
4731780	4737300	the scary bits and new weapons, new weapons was good, but man, Descent was the
4737300	4744660	first game I played that gave me motion sickness and I sucked at it, but I loved
4744660	4746020	it for people our age.
4746020	4748900	They all remember the first time playing a game like Descent.
4748900	4752340	It was like, it's doom and 360 degrees.
4752340	4753700	No, but it's so cool.
4753700	4755060	It was even more than that.
4755060	4758980	Instead of having your, you know, little space shooters where you're on rails or,
4758980	4762820	you know, going through different areas, you had full freedom of movement.
4762820	4763780	It was amazing.
4764580	4768980	Um, I mean, and yeah, there were more games, you know, there was when it went
4768980	4773460	into Descent three, but going back to the original and bringing in those factors
4773460	4776660	that made the original great is I think a good idea.
4776660	4783700	There's, uh, Eurogamer actually has a, uh, um, trailer for it up on their website.
4783700	4784500	It looked pretty good.
4786340	4787780	I liked the music in Descent too.
4789140	4791700	All right, let's move on and travel around the world and check out some release
4791700	4794900	dates and things that are coming through more official channels this week.
4794900	4797060	Yeah, I think there's something coming out this week.
4797060	4798420	I'm sure there's a game.
4798420	4800340	Um, we'll, we'll get to it though.
4800340	4802420	Uh, see what we've got this week.
4802420	4804660	Uh, what's the, what's the big game that's coming out?
4804660	4810820	Maybe it's a Freaky Forms Deluxe Creations Alive on 3DS.
4810820	4811460	Is that it?
4811460	4812340	No, maybe.
4813220	4816100	Uh, maybe it's a game for a system that's not out for a couple of weeks.
4816100	4819300	Mass Effect 3, the special edition for the Wii U.
4821140	4822420	Yeah, probably want to wait on that one.
4822420	4823460	That's out this week.
4824260	4825140	How does that work?
4826980	4827860	I don't know.
4827860	4829860	I think, I think the dates need adjusting.
4829860	4832020	I think, I think, you know, they're, what?
4833460	4836340	We've got in hand like Scribblenauts already.
4836340	4838900	Um, not that we can do anything with it.
4838900	4839220	All right.
4840100	4846340	Uh, maybe it's Nickelodeon Bubble Guppies on the DS or Nickelodeon Team Umi Zumi and
4846340	4851860	Dora's Fantastic Flight, both rated EC for those hardcore gamers out there in the DS.
4852500	4856660	Uh, or maybe Nickelodeon Dance 2 on the Wii and Xbox 360.
4857620	4858660	No, no.
4859540	4864500	NASCAR, the game Inside Line on PS3, Xbox 360, and Wii.
4864500	4865140	Maybe?
4865140	4865380	No.
4866260	4869460	Mass Effect Trilogy on PC and Xbox 360.
4869460	4872340	That is absolutely the game, as everybody.
4872980	4873380	Totally.
4874420	4878100	Midway Arcade Origins on PS3 and Xbox 360 this week.
4879540	4882500	Also, I bought, I bought that last generation.
4883140	4888900	Also, uh, History Legends of War Patton on Xbox 360 and PS3.
4889460	4891620	Oh, I think that's coming out next year, though.
4891620	4894660	Uh, Pop Tropica Adventures on the DS.
4895380	4901700	Dragon Ball Z Budokai HD Collection on PS3 and Xbox 360.
4901700	4903700	Ragnarok Tactics on PSP.
4905380	4908340	Uh, on PSP?
4908340	4909220	PSP.
4910100	4912980	Not Vita, PSP.
4912980	4915780	They just had a Ragnarok game on Vita already.
4915780	4916900	It came out last week.
4917540	4922500	Um, Saints Row the Third, the full package on PS3 and Xbox 360.
4922500	4926180	Let's be honest, so this really has the same content that was already on disc for the last game.
4927780	4928420	Ba dum bum.
4928980	4932500	Well, except for the, except for the three expansions, but all the other DLC was on disc.
4933060	4937300	Um, Big Time Rush Dance Party on the Wii.
4939940	4941700	Rayman Origins on the 3DS.
4942500	4944980	Pro Evolution Soccer 2013 on the Wii.
4946500	4948740	Little Big Planet Karting on PS3.
4949300	4953540	Oh, and that's right, there is a game called Halo 4 that's out on the 360 this week as well.
4954340	4957380	And not to be, uh, outdone, Nintendo does have a game coming out.
4957380	4960180	Paper Mario Sticker Star on the 3DS one week from today.
4961220	4963940	Ray Genator just made one of my favorite jokes about NASCAR.
4964740	4966260	NASCAR has left turned the game.
4969380	4969940	Oh boy.
4969940	4971140	You really like to go left.
4971140	4972100	You really like Tide.
4975060	4978420	You gonna go to one of those midnight releases and pick up, uh, Little Big Planet Karting?
4979620	4981860	I'm not even sure if I'm gonna pick up Little Big Planet Karting.
4981860	4984260	I wanna play it, but I haven't played Little Big Planet 2.
4985860	4986900	So, probably not.
4987700	4989620	Although, I do like Karting games.
4989620	4992180	I'd be a little bit more, you know, motivated to play that, but.
4992180	4996340	All I'm gonna say, I know you haven't seen Wreck-It Ralph yet, I'm not gonna spoil it for you,
4996340	4998900	but they need to make Sugar Rush a real game.
4998980	5000340	Yes, they do.
5000340	5003140	But, because that was fucking outstanding.
5003140	5005220	I would play the hell out of Sugar Rush.
5005220	5010580	Wreck-It Ralph is in the new Sonic and Sega All-Stars racing game, Transformed.
5010580	5012660	Well, I hope there's a track or something.
5012660	5013460	There'd be Vanellope.
5013460	5014820	Yeah, Vanellope von Schweetz.
5015460	5020660	Which, by the way, there's actually a commercial for Sugar Rush.
5020660	5021060	Oh yeah?
5021060	5023220	That was done as a sort of trailer for Wreck-It Ralph.
5023220	5023860	Nice.
5023860	5028340	Um, talking about the arcade, they're getting it in four quarters on your birthday.
5028820	5032340	I so want to say a quote from the ending, and I can't say it because it's a spoiler,
5032340	5034740	but it's one of the, like, you gotta know what I'm talking about.
5034740	5036980	I was laughing so hard.
5036980	5038580	It was the funniest thing in the movie.
5038580	5039620	Like, I'll tell you later.
5040340	5041140	Off air.
5041140	5042420	I don't want to spoil it.
5042420	5045540	Alright, let's spoil some Japanese release dates.
5045540	5048580	Did you know that Japan is also getting Halo 4 this week,
5048580	5053460	and they're getting some new Xbox 360s to come along with it for all those Japanese Halo fans?
5053460	5054180	There you go.
5054180	5056340	Both of you guys can get that this week.
5057300	5059300	Also coming out this week on the Xbox 360,
5059300	5060980	Tropico 4 Gold Edition.
5060980	5063220	I think that's just a price reduction of an existing game.
5063220	5065460	It's a re-release they're doing.
5066100	5067780	It's the game with the expansion.
5067780	5068660	Alright.
5068660	5072260	On the PlayStation 3, Silent Hill Downpour, finally,
5073140	5075620	on the PlayStation 3 in Japan this week.
5075620	5078500	Shin Sangoku Musou Six Empires.
5078500	5082180	Hokuto Musou International getting a price reduction from Koei,
5082180	5087140	as well as a price reduction for Champion Jockey, G1 Jockey, and Gallop Racer,
5087140	5090020	for those of you that like your horsey racing games in Japan.
5090020	5093220	And the really embarrassing move integration.
5093220	5094900	Oh, is that the other big thing?
5094900	5097700	You're the one that looks like you're playing, was it?
5098420	5099220	Final Furlong.
5099220	5100420	Final Furlong, yeah.
5100420	5101700	That game was amazing.
5101700	5102820	Horse Humping the game.
5102820	5104020	Uh, let's see.
5104020	5106980	Lastly, when do we get Wii U stuff in Japan?
5106980	5107380	Oh, that's right.
5107380	5108740	They don't get it until December, huh?
5109780	5111780	I don't start reading those release dates until December.
5113060	5114500	How about the Nintendo 3DS?
5115460	5119620	Another 3DS LL, which is basically their XL pack.
5119620	5123700	It's a Dobutsu no Mori pack, limited edition,
5123700	5129860	because Tobidase Dobutsu no Mori comes out this week on the Nintendo 3DS.
5129860	5131860	And what is Dobutsu no Mori?
5131860	5132660	Animal Forest.
5132660	5133300	That's right.
5133300	5134820	AKA Animal Crossing.
5134820	5135220	That's right.
5135220	5137620	Animal Crossing is the big release on the 3DS.
5137620	5139300	Technically, that would be Animal's Forest.
5140020	5143860	Now, um, if Animal Crossing isn't your thing, maybe you're more into Jewel Pet.
5145860	5151860	Maho de Osare ni Dance Deco comes out this week as well on the 3DS.
5151860	5156820	That's fantastic that the, you know, 3DS isn't region-free like the DS was, because,
5156820	5160820	you know, people then can't import games that they like to play.
5160820	5164420	It would be very hard to play Animal Crossing anyway, because it's all in Japan, Japanese.
5164420	5169060	I've freaking tried on my Dobutsu no Mori for GameCube.
5169060	5174020	And even being, I read so slowly, it takes an hour to do anything.
5174020	5175700	But I think what's really cool is that,
5175700	5178500	I don't know if you guys know this, but the, well, I know I'm sure you do, Jamie,
5178500	5181380	but when the little characters read when they're talking,
5181380	5185860	in the Japanese version of the game, they were saying the little Japanese syllables really quick.
5185860	5187700	So it sounded like they were actually talking.
5187700	5190580	But in the English version, you can't really do that same thing.
5190580	5193140	So they would say the letters of the alphabet real fast.
5193140	5193640	Yeah.
5194200	5194700	So...
5194700	5197400	And see, that's why I wanted the Japanese one to play.
5197400	5197900	Yeah.
5197900	5200440	Because I thought it would help me with my listening comprehension, no.
5201480	5203320	No, it went way too fast.
5204040	5204600	Made it worse.
5204600	5205960	Okay, how about the UK, DarkSakura?
5206680	5208600	We have a few selections for the UK.
5208600	5210360	On November 6th is Halo 4.
5210920	5214920	On the 7th is Curiosity for iPhone, PC, Android, and iPad.
5216520	5219800	I hope the cube contains eternal joy.
5220760	5223640	Karateka for Xbox 360.
5225240	5226040	When is the weekend?
5226040	5227400	Are you gonna get the cube?
5227400	5228520	Do you want to know what's in the cube?
5228520	5230200	Curiosity, what's in the fucking cube?
5230200	5231080	What's in the box?
5231720	5232920	What's in the fucking box?
5232920	5233720	Tell me what's in the box.
5233720	5235800	I still have to update my iOS version,
5236840	5240440	but I would like to pirate it just for the principle of the thing.
5241160	5243800	On November 8th, we have Angry Birds Star Wars.
5245320	5249240	On the 9th, a little big cart, little big planet carting.
5249320	5253000	And Mass Effect trilogy, which I'm gonna make my husband get me.
5254280	5255640	And that's it.
5255640	5260920	You do, I hope you did realize that little big planet carting is not coming on the Vita at launch.
5262520	5266120	But if I buy it on the PS3, I'll still get my free Vita, right?
5266120	5267480	Isn't that part of the deal?
5267480	5269000	I haven't seen the sticker on the box.
5269560	5271800	I know it's on the box for the PlayStation All-Stars stuff,
5271800	5275080	but at the same time, like, I don't really want that game.
5275080	5276520	That's not even gonna sell that for me.
5277240	5280440	By the way, you know what I totally love about playing Mass Effect on the PC?
5280440	5281240	What?
5281240	5284520	Is hacking the coalesced I&I file to get other outfits.
5284520	5286680	And you wonder why you can't get online in part three.
5286680	5289400	No, I reinstalled the fucker.
5290280	5291480	And it wasn't working.
5291480	5293240	So bite my booty.
5293240	5293880	Reported.
5296680	5299480	All right, just a couple more news stories for you guys.
5299480	5303000	And then the classic game of the week, back when games worked.
5303880	5304380	Loki.
5305340	5308220	So yes, there's a patent firm.
5308220	5311020	And I don't even know why these things exist, but whatever.
5311660	5317500	A Texas company has filed a lawsuit against Wizards of the Coast.
5318460	5320540	Or not against Wizards of the Coast, I guess.
5320540	5323340	Hasbro, who has the Magic of the Gathering online game.
5323340	5325900	I didn't even realize Hasbro does online games,
5325900	5327820	but okay, I guess I got in the video game.
5327820	5330460	So anyways, so Magic of the Gathering online.
5331660	5334140	You know, it's been out there for a while now.
5334300	5335260	Ten years.
5335260	5340220	And I guess this Wildcat intellectual property holdings of Dallas.
5340220	5344300	They're filing a lawsuit against them to get it taken offline.
5344300	5347500	I guess they hold the patent for Unit Commander.
5348060	5351820	Which calls, I guess, the ultimate mercenary trading card game.
5352540	5354620	And they're saying that it infringes on that.
5355740	5362140	Which something tells me that they probably had the Magic of the Gathering out there
5362140	5366300	for a lot longer than they've had the patent for Unit Commander.
5367660	5372300	Which, I might add, is about as generic as their patent for said game.
5374460	5375100	I don't know.
5375100	5375600	We'll see.
5377740	5378940	We'll see if they even...
5378940	5380860	I don't think anything's really gonna happen to it.
5380860	5382220	I mean, patent troll.
5383020	5383820	We can do.
5383820	5387500	It really does astound me that Magic of the Gathering is still going after all this time.
5387500	5388700	Pretty strong, you know?
5388700	5391660	There was just a tournament here locally over the weekend, did you know that?
5392140	5393020	I wouldn't doubt it.
5393020	5395500	They have tournaments playing this like mad.
5395500	5396940	And I still suck at it.
5398940	5401500	Well, it's because they've had all this practice and...
5401500	5401980	It's true.
5401980	5403340	They've been playing for 15 years.
5404300	5405020	I took a break.
5405660	5408140	All right, this is pretty awesome.
5408140	5410700	A new remake that's been announced for the 3DS.
5410700	5412060	Dark Soccer, you might be into this too.
5413020	5416300	Dragon Quest 7 is being remade for the 3DS.
5417100	5419660	It's already got a date of February 7th in Japan.
5419740	5421820	It's gonna have a new soundtrack and so forth.
5422700	5424780	So yeah, that's awesome.
5424780	5427420	Yeah, Jump Magazine made the confirmation.
5427420	5430060	February 7th, 6,090 yen.
5430860	5434300	There will be street pass and Wi-Fi capabilities added to the game.
5434300	5435420	I don't know what that's gonna entail.
5435420	5436940	That's pretty fucking rad.
5436940	5441500	The soundtrack will be performed by the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra.
5442380	5443180	That's rad.
5444220	5444780	Very nice.
5444780	5446460	I really hope that comes out over here.
5446460	5446960	We'll see.
5447840	5452240	Dragon Quest 7, if you weren't aware, was originally released on the PlayStation 1.
5452240	5453680	That was about 12 years ago.
5453680	5456320	It was released in the USA, Dragon Warrior 7.
5456320	5456820	Yes, it was.
5457920	5461120	Didn't they finally go back to calling it Dragon Quest in the US with 8, though?
5461120	5461360	Yeah.
5461360	5462080	I thought they did.
5462080	5462960	Oh, and the play...
5462960	5465440	Man, that's a PS2 game needed to go back and really beat.
5465440	5467200	Dragon Quest 8 was so good.
5467200	5469520	The demo for that was like a big thing.
5470720	5475040	So no word yet if that is coming here, but one can hope.
5476960	5480080	I bet it'll be one of those things we don't get to next holiday, though.
5480080	5481200	But that's pretty awesome.
5481920	5483120	Dragon Quest 7.
5483840	5487440	Well, what a good lead-in to the Classic Game of the Week.
5487440	5490240	I don't know if this week's game is 12 years old or older,
5491440	5495360	but every week we like to let DarkSakura take a step into the Classic Gaming Vault
5495360	5497040	and find a game that she thinks,
5497040	5497540	hey,
5498640	5499140	Bratz,
5500080	5501120	play this game,
5501120	5502800	and then report me for calling you a brat.
5503760	5505040	It's the Classic Game of the Week.
5505040	5506720	DarkSakura, what is the Classic Game of the Week?
5506720	5507360	Bank your ass.
5508560	5509840	Uh, it's Giga-Wink 2.
5510880	5514000	And I'm actually specifically referring to the Dreamcast version,
5514000	5516720	because today has been my day of Dreamcast love.
5517520	5519440	It's always a day of Dreamcast love for you.
5519440	5521280	This was a fun shooter,
5521280	5523120	and the cool thing about it is that,
5523760	5525040	even in the arcade version,
5525040	5529680	it was actually made for a horizontal monitor instead of being turned vertically.
5530720	5531920	You know another game that did that?
5532560	5533440	Radiant Silver Gun.
5534320	5534820	How's that?
5535620	5539620	But anyway, the game was originally developed by Takumi,
5539620	5543140	and it came out on the NAOMI arcade system,
5543140	5545380	and then in 2001 it came out on the Dreamcast.
5546980	5550340	It basically has like uber huge scores.
5550340	5552980	It seriously is like the ego-pumping score system.
5552980	5554820	You can actually score in the quintillions.
5554820	5555460	Did you know that?
5557060	5561460	On top of that, the good thing about it being a horizontal monitor
5561460	5564660	is that taking it from arcade to the home version,
5564740	5568980	meant that you pretty much still got the arcade treatment.
5568980	5572100	You didn't have to worry about rotating your TV or anything else,
5572100	5573860	you know, on edge or any of that,
5574420	5577380	which we've actually done some games before.
5577380	5579780	In the Dreamcast version, it added a score attack mode,
5579780	5582100	a four player mode, gallery mode, online ranking,
5582740	5589140	and which actually ended on December 10th, 2003.
5590180	5594500	So you had like a ton of different fighters.
5595460	5597220	A good half of them actually were unlocked.
5597220	5602980	You could have Kingfisher, Sparrow, Ravenstork, and Albatross,
5602980	5605780	and then you could have the Raijin,
5608340	5611540	Porchka, Stranger, Carmine, and Wilderstand,
5612260	5615060	which were from the first Giggling.
5616260	5618980	The soundtrack was super awesome,
5618980	5621620	and I even remembered when you could get the soundtrack,
5621620	5623300	it came with the soundtrack from Mars Matrix,
5623300	5624980	which is another game I probably should do,
5626100	5628180	but the music is all orchestral.
5628180	5629220	It should turn up a little bit.
5634580	5636180	They had a really crazy soundtrack.
5636180	5639620	I mean, really, I mean, in the end, it's a shooter, yeah,
5640500	5643620	but it's definitely one that people should check out,
5643620	5647380	especially since the Dreamcast is still kind of around and kicking.
5648340	5648980	And it's pretty.
5649620	5651380	And the other thing about that too,
5651380	5654820	is it is basically around the gameplay itself,
5654820	5658500	is around the absorption and reflection type mechanics.
5659540	5662580	It's huge boss fights, tons of enemies.
5663220	5665540	It's, I wouldn't quite say it's a bullet hell
5665540	5667060	as much as it is an enemy hell,
5668020	5671060	but I love the level scrolling in the design.
5671060	5673620	It's like it adds another layer of depth,
5673620	5677780	even if it is a top-down type shooter.
5678420	5680740	So definitely worth playing.
5681700	5682340	All righty.
5682340	5684420	Some Dreamcast love from dark soccer this week
5684420	5685540	in the classic game of the week.
5685540	5688900	It is Giga Wing 2, or the Dreamcast.
5690420	5691220	Very nice pick.
5692740	5693460	Let's see.
5693460	5695220	Yyr in the chat room says,
5695220	5697380	Giga Wing 2 is also the only shmup I know of
5697380	5699220	that supports four simultaneous players.
5699780	5700340	Exactly.
5701300	5701780	All right.
5702500	5704740	Well, that is going to do it for part A of our show,
5704740	5705460	but don't go anywhere.
5705460	5707940	There is plenty more Orange Launch Radio to come tonight,
5707940	5709860	including the Fugu question of the week.
5709860	5712420	Some details on the Wii U's browser.
5712420	5713620	It's going to be very interesting,
5713620	5715620	as well as some other Nintendo details.
5715620	5718820	And Mega Man Wily Wars.
5718820	5720340	If you don't know about this game,
5720340	5721620	may have fallen off your radar.
5721620	5722340	It's not a new game.
5722340	5723460	It's a game for many, many years ago.
5723460	5724740	It was for the Genesis.
5724740	5728420	It never came out in the US until now.
5728420	5730500	So we'll be talking about that after the break.
5736660	5739780	Welcome back everybody to Orange Lounge Radio.
5739780	5741300	Live at the Voice of Geeks Network,
5741300	5745700	vaughnetwork.com with the 480th episode of our show.
5747060	5749220	Possibly a different time for some of you tonight,
5749220	5751300	because there was that whole daylight savings
5751300	5752820	that happened over the weekend.
5752820	5755460	And you know what they say, spring forward, fall back.
5755460	5757860	So everybody got an extra hour sleep last night.
5757860	5758420	Woo hoo.
5758420	5759220	I needed it.
5759220	5762020	Or if you were me, you got home at four in the morning
5762020	5763300	instead of five in the morning.
5764580	5765780	That was my lucky thing,
5765780	5768020	but that's what I get for going to the Bay Area
5768020	5770260	and staying out late and then driving home the same night.
5770260	5770980	Why?
5770980	5774740	Because I had Starbucks and I wasn't feeling tired.
5775460	5778260	Hooray, by the way, for Peppermint Mocha's
5778260	5779380	being back at Starbucks.
5779380	5781380	I guess technically you can get those any time of the year.
5781380	5782740	You can also get them sugar free.
5782740	5784740	But yeah, they have the skinny ones now, which is great.
5784740	5786180	But you know what they don't have yet
5786180	5787940	is the gingerbread lattes.
5787940	5789940	And those are amazing.
5789940	5791860	Anyway, it's not a coffee cast.
5791860	5792980	It's a video game cast.
5792980	5795620	It's just coffee is sometimes how we get through the day.
5796500	5798020	We will get back to video games.
5798020	5800020	Rob, coffee is how I get through my life.
5800900	5803380	I do want to mention the elections are this week.
5803380	5804100	You might have heard.
5804100	5807460	So of course, if you live in the US or, you know,
5807460	5809940	a country that lets you vote, you probably should vote.
5810660	5812580	It is your right after all.
5812580	5815060	And remember, you do not get to bitch about the results
5815060	5816580	if you do not vote.
5816580	5819700	And I, for one, can't wait for those freaking election calls
5819700	5822100	to stop calling me on my phone every 10 minutes.
5822100	5824900	I did, however, get to call Dan Lundgren.
5825620	5827300	A dick where he would hear it.
5828340	5828980	Good times.
5828980	5830420	Of course, it was an accident.
5830420	5832100	It just cracked me up that you and I
5832100	5834660	got the exact same phone call at the exact same time
5834660	5835860	while we were sitting here in the studio.
5835860	5836660	It's like, really?
5836660	5837160	Really?
5837700	5840740	Anyhow, let's get it back into video games
5840740	5842260	and some rapid fire news.
5842260	5842760	Loki.
5843300	5843800	All right.
5844580	5846100	So first thing, we're going to talk a little bit
5846100	5849540	about a new addition for a smart glass member.
5849540	5852020	We knew that Forza Horizon was going to use smart glass,
5852020	5853220	but it kind of wasn't.
5853220	5854900	So now it is.
5854980	5857140	And so they've got some really cool stuff with that,
5857140	5860180	including an in-game map that you can use,
5861700	5862740	which is kind of cool.
5862740	5865620	And I guess it allows you to do all the same stuff
5865620	5867060	that you can do by pausing the game,
5867060	5868660	but now without pausing the game.
5868660	5871380	And you can set destination GPSes and all that stuff.
5873300	5874340	Might be kind of cool.
5874340	5875700	I'd have to check that out, I guess.
5876260	5878340	Because Forza looks like it might be fun.
5878340	5879940	Have to ask Bobby if he's tried it yet.
5880740	5882660	He did a review at vognetwork.com.
5882660	5883860	He would tell you to go read.
5883860	5884580	Well, I understand that.
5884580	5885940	But I meant about the smart glass thing.
5885940	5886900	Oh, the smart glass.
5886900	5888180	Oh, I don't know about that.
5888180	5888680	Yeah.
5889300	5891620	He's busy with the football stuff.
5891620	5894340	So I played the demo for Forza.
5894340	5895460	I didn't do the smart glass thing,
5895460	5896660	because I don't think that's in the demo.
5896660	5898500	But I like the demo.
5898500	5900580	I might pick up the game.
5900580	5900980	I don't know.
5900980	5903300	It's kind of like there's just so much right now that.
5903300	5904740	I have that racing wheel, man.
5904740	5907540	It's been collecting dust that I kind of need to use that.
5907540	5910100	So I may have to pick it up to try that.
5911460	5911960	Excellent.
5912520	5915880	Um, also something that's kind of cool, that shoot mania storm.
5915880	5917800	I was kind of a fan of track mania.
5917800	5921080	And so now they're getting into the other type of games.
5921080	5925800	Shoot mania being their kind of first person shooter arena battle game.
5925800	5930600	Although, I mean, one of the things about the whole mania series is that you can customize
5930600	5933560	everything, including the game types and all that and share those.
5933560	5939960	So it is going to be, I guess, coming soon in a beta form.
5940520	5943080	And that'll be out in December.
5943080	5949400	And then the game is expected to arrive on January 23rd, which is going to be kind of cool.
5949400	5953160	And I guess the beta is going to also have like a welcome build.
5953160	5955560	They're going to have a couple new game modes and stuff.
5955560	5959320	Like one they mentioned is laser jump and wall jump and grappling hook.
5960840	5962600	I can't help but think about looking at this stuff.
5962600	5965480	It'd be kind of cool like a 3D laser tag game.
5965480	5966840	That might be pretty awesome, but.
5967560	5969000	Oh, you and laser tag.
5969000	5970120	Fucking love laser tag.
5970120	5971800	When was the last time you went to like a Qsar?
5971800	5972680	It's been a while.
5972680	5973480	Oh, that's too bad.
5973480	5974680	I miss the Qsars.
5975640	5978280	They still have that one in Vacaville, which is like the closest one sadly.
5979000	5981240	Yeah, I think they do, but it's just kind of.
5982120	5983720	It's a sad shadow of its former self.
5983720	5984520	Exactly.
5984520	5989080	I mean, in the next closest ones in Concord or Pleasanton.
5990600	5991100	I don't know.
5992280	5994440	Well, if I can drive to Milpitas, go to the Great Mall.
5995400	5996280	Well, I mean.
5996280	5997240	And get shoes.
5997400	6000360	It's not a matter of driving there because it's only like 45 minutes away, but
6000920	6002520	it's just not worth it.
6002520	6004840	It's just very, very much in disrepair.
6004840	6008440	And it's Vacaville and like kind of a hick town.
6008440	6009160	Vacaville.
6010200	6010440	Yeah.
6010440	6013160	Let's say you're playing with a bunch of redneck guys.
6013160	6014600	And then you can go to the nut tree.
6016760	6017320	Moving on.
6017320	6017960	Sorry.
6017960	6019560	I didn't mean to localize the show.
6019560	6020060	Sorry.
6021320	6024360	And in Portals, getting some DLC that they've hinted at a while back.
6025000	6027160	It was a whole DLC that was kind of part of the.
6029160	6036360	Was it the motion controller shit that they had on PC, but it never kind of took off.
6036360	6041080	But now they have this whole move based motion stuff that they're kind of porting over from
6041080	6041400	that.
6041400	6043800	So it's the in motion DLC.
6043800	6047960	It's going to come on November 6 for 10 bucks.
6047960	6051160	And also, I guess the full game is also going to get move support as well.
6051160	6052600	They're going to patch that in.
6052600	6058920	And it was six cents was the company that made the original stuff.
6058920	6062200	It's 20 new test chambers that you can play.
6062200	6064760	And I guess they have new cubes that you can adjust the size of.
6064760	6069240	And you can also move portals around stuff and rotate objects using the move controller.
6070120	6070840	That might be fun.
6070840	6071640	I have portal too.
6071640	6073800	And I do have a move that I'm not using.
6073800	6076120	So maybe.
6076120	6076620	Maybe.
6078440	6078760	All right.
6078760	6079960	Moving on to some other news.
6080760	6083240	We've been talking a little bit about the Mass Effect trilogy.
6083240	6085320	It is also coming to the PlayStation 3.
6085320	6087080	But you'll have to wait a little longer.
6087080	6090760	December 4 is the date that was announced for Mass Effect trilogy on the PlayStation
6090760	6091000	3.
6091000	6092440	That's December 7 in Europe.
6093320	6095080	So at least it'll make it before Christmas.
6095080	6096760	But it is going to be about a month behind.
6096760	6101720	But I mean, a lot of people are waiting for the PlayStation debut of the original Mass
6101720	6103480	Effect, which, of course, will be in the trilogy.
6103480	6107480	Or you'll also be able to get it on the PlayStation Network.
6107480	6109080	It's going to set you back 15 bucks.
6110120	6111320	There's also excuse me.
6112840	6114680	Oh, sneezing radio guy's worst enemy.
6115800	6119320	There's also some detail on the DLC that's going to be included with the trilogy.
6119960	6124200	All the Cerberus Network with Mass Effect 2, of course, on the PlayStation 3, though,
6124200	6128920	you're going to get Lair of the Shadow Broker, Kasumi, which is like what you need most of
6128920	6131240	all, and Overlord.
6131240	6132600	You get do you get Zaid?
6132600	6134600	It doesn't say Zaid and it doesn't say Arrival.
6135320	6136760	So you don't get all of the place.
6136760	6139480	Arrival was really necessary to the story.
6140120	6142680	Well, they can get another 10 bucks out of you, though.
6142680	6145720	Mass Effect 3 will have Cerberus Network, but not Leviathan.
6146360	6149080	But I'm assuming it will have the multiplayer and all that good stuff.
6149080	6152040	So that's that's one of the best features that keeps it going.
6152040	6152680	So there you go.
6153240	6155000	December 4th on the PlayStation 3.
6155000	6162360	And I kind of want it just because I have I have the entire trilogy on 360, the entire
6162360	6163240	trilogy on PC.
6163240	6168200	I think I kind of owe it to myself to get the entire trilogy on PlayStation as well.
6168200	6169240	Don't you agree, Loki?
6169480	6170520	Don't you get my logic?
6170520	6171640	Don't you understand me?
6171640	6172140	Nope.
6175080	6177400	There's a Wreck-It Ralph IOS game.
6177400	6180520	If you were a fan of the movie, maybe you'll be a fan of the IOS game.
6180520	6185080	It includes Fix-It Felix Junior, which is the game that the movie's about.
6185080	6189000	I do want to point out, though, Fix-It Felix Junior is also a standalone app for free.
6189640	6193960	This other app is 99 cents, and you can also get Sweet Climber.
6193960	6197400	It has it's just inspired by Sugar Rush, but it's not a racing game.
6197400	6200360	It's a bounce up the thing.
6200360	6204680	It references the scene in the movie, but you tilt the controller or your controller.
6204680	6209080	You tilt your iPhone back and forth or iPad or whatever to move him left and right.
6209080	6215160	And then Hero's Duty is like a twin stick shooter, which was kind of neat, I guess,
6215160	6219560	except the fact that there's no tangible joystick on the iPad, which is stupid.
6219560	6220060	Unless.
6221720	6224680	I don't know if it has IK support because it's a twin stick shooter.
6225560	6229160	There's also, I'll tell you, I downloaded it because it's only 99 cents.
6229160	6229560	What the hell?
6229560	6230280	And I love the movie.
6230920	6236040	There is also apparently Turbo Time is a game that's coming, but it's locked right now.
6236040	6237080	It says coming soon.
6237080	6239960	So there will be, it looks like a fourth game added into it.
6239960	6241160	So pretty cool.
6241160	6243800	If you're a fan of Wreck-It Ralph, the IOS game's out there right now.
6244840	6250520	There was a wedding in gaming this week, and this is a pretty good one for the gaming industry.
6251320	6255400	John Romero and Brenda Brathwaite actually got married.
6255400	6258680	This is actually last weekend, but just the news came out this week.
6259480	6265480	Get this, between the two of them, Doom, Wizardry, Quake, Commander Keen,
6265480	6267720	Jagged Alliance, Wolfenstein 3D.
6268680	6272360	Maybe this is why, wasn't she one of the two people behind that
6272360	6275640	Kickstarter for like the old school RPG or something like that?
6275640	6277880	I can't remember.
6277880	6279560	I think she was, and maybe that's why.
6280680	6282520	Her name came up on the show recently.
6282520	6286600	Yeah, maybe that's why they closed down the whole Kickstarter for that.
6286600	6291880	Well, they also established a social game studio together in 2010.
6291880	6294840	Loot Drop was the studio that they co-founded together.
6295720	6301400	They were married by id Software co-founder Tom Hall, which is pretty cute.
6302280	6304840	And get this, Star Soccer, guess where they were married?
6306280	6307720	Disneyland on the Steamboat.
6308360	6315800	Oh, and then for their honeymoon, they went to hell and killed demons.
6315800	6316280	Just kidding.
6316280	6317000	And it was fun.
6317000	6317640	And it was fun.
6318360	6319800	All right, let's move on.
6319800	6321240	Dark Soccer, what do you have for us?
6321240	6324040	Some stuff, things.
6324040	6326680	How about some Ragnarok stuff?
6327480	6330280	The developer for Ragnarok is working and that's,
6330280	6332680	God, I hate when my screen messes up like this.
6332680	6339080	That's Kazuki Morishita, I believe, is working on a Nintendo 3DS title.
6339640	6343400	They're not saying what it's going to be, but he works in Ragnarok.
6343400	6345880	So hey, maybe it's more Ragnarok.
6347240	6353960	Then in more news, Treasure is working on a Nintendo 3DS exclusive.
6354680	6359080	So you know if Treasure's behind it, it's going to be fucking weird and pretty good.
6360120	6360600	Weird and good.
6360600	6361400	I mean, they did Gunstar Jokes.
6361400	6362680	Fucking weird, but pretty good.
6362680	6363320	Yeah.
6363320	6365720	I don't think Treasure's ever put out any crap.
6365720	6366220	So.
6369000	6380040	And then, Cypress Hill's shag loses $250 million at the Grand Theft Auto lawsuit.
6381000	6388680	Basically, he said that his likeness and life story was used to create the character CJ
6389320	6391000	in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
6391960	6394120	And the judge said no.
6394920	6396280	Sorry, you lose.
6396280	6398920	Do not pass go lose $250 million.
6398920	6401320	I don't think he lost $250 million.
6401320	6402200	He lost the ability to win.
6402200	6404360	He didn't win $250 million.
6404360	6407080	But you can't lose what you didn't get.
6407080	6408200	$250 million.
6408200	6410120	Well, that and he had to pay for his court costs.
6410120	6411240	So he's probably out something.
6411240	6412440	He's out something.
6412440	6412940	Yep.
6413320	6414120	And you know what I say?
6415720	6418360	That whole lawsuit was insane in the membrane.
6419880	6420440	Womp womp.
6421240	6422200	Okay, that's it.
6422200	6422680	Oh, that's it.
6422680	6423240	All right.
6423240	6425640	Let's go to the FUGL question of the week.
6433960	6438600	Take the words Facebook and Google as in plus and slam them together and you get FUGL.
6438600	6439960	And that's where the statement comes from.
6439960	6444280	It's where we ask our fan community is a question and get their answers.
6444280	6448280	And of course, as everybody's talking about the movies, we had to make the FUGL question
6448280	6449480	about Wreck-It Ralph.
6449480	6453560	If the box office numbers are any indication, it looks like many of you saw Wreck-It Ralph
6453560	6454120	this weekend.
6454120	6455320	What'd you think of the movie?
6455320	6458520	Was it a great thing for video games or were you not happy at the way things were done?
6459240	6461960	Act Def starts us off on Google Plus saying, I loved it.
6461960	6463400	Everything about it was great.
6463400	6465480	The story, the cameos, the jokes, everything.
6465480	6467320	Anyone who hasn't seen this movie should do so.
6467320	6467800	It's great.
6467800	6470120	It truly surpasses the Disney standards.
6470120	6471960	Was it a great thing for video games?
6471960	6476120	That I really do not know since the movie only has references to games and such, but
6476120	6480200	it isn't a real video game movie like Silent Hill, for example.
6480200	6483000	It's just a story set in a video game universe.
6483000	6486680	But maybe it'll get people interested in retro gaming since most of the references are really
6486680	6487960	from the old days of gaming.
6489240	6493240	Elliot B. answers the question on Google and says, I was really excited about seeing it.
6493240	6494680	The trailer looked great.
6494680	6498760	Then I realized it's not out until February here in the UK.
6498760	6501480	Here's something I want to just pose a question.
6501480	6504520	Do you think there are kids growing up nowadays that don't know what an arcade is?
6506360	6510360	You know, one thing I will fault the movie for is that it was a little, you did have
6510360	6514360	to suspend disbelief that people were lining up at the arcade to get in when they'd open
6514360	6519480	it in the morning and that it was as full as it looked because you and I, and she all
6519480	6521320	know that arcades don't look like that anymore.
6521320	6523400	Unfortunately, there's a water park attached.
6523400	6523720	Yeah.
6523720	6524520	Right.
6524520	6529880	So, um, that you did have to suspend disbelief for a little bit, but are there kids growing
6529880	6531560	up today that don't know what an arcade is?
6531560	6535400	Um, no, because kids still have birthday parties at Chuck E Cheese and Dave and Bust, well,
6535400	6539960	or whatever, all those types of places, bounce houses have arcades in them.
6539960	6541880	Here's the, it's all ticket redemption.
6541880	6546760	You have a few arcade games in there, but most of it's ticket redemption.
6546760	6548120	Disneyland still has arcades.
6548680	6554680	You know, there's arcades around, but it's just a lot of them tend to be the dollar experiences
6554680	6561160	and, you know, they're driving games or, you know, gun games or whatever.
6561160	6564680	Just very few of the fix it, Felix Jr.
6564680	6568680	Type of games, which clearly was inspired by Donkey Kong and that type of stuff that,
6568680	6574200	that type of experience doesn't really exist anymore, except maybe in the corner to get
6574200	6575640	little use out of those old games.
6577720	6578760	So Elliot wants to snow.
6578760	6580840	He went and saw Skyfall instead.
6580840	6584680	Now see, Skyfall is now here until this week and I really want to see it.
6586040	6587720	Dan's been pissing himself over.
6587720	6591720	I actually really like James Bond movies, so I'm kind of excited about Skyfall.
6591720	6594040	Craig is pretty, he's a great Bond.
6594040	6594680	He's great.
6594680	6595560	I love his eyes.
6596360	6598120	He'll be even better as Indiana Jones.
6599800	6602200	Next up, E3VL.
6602200	6604840	I guess that's evil on Google Plus.
6604840	6608920	Loved the video game nostalgia, especially those happening in the background and emotional
6608920	6609720	spikes.
6609720	6612360	This film was like the Roger Rabbit of video games.
6612360	6616920	Seems like the movie panders way too much to the old gen gamers, 20 plus years old with
6616920	6618360	the video game references.
6618360	6622840	Younger audiences may feel bored if it weren't for the Sugar Rush game and level puns.
6622840	6626760	If you bring your kids, prepare for them to be confused and saddened in certain segments
6626760	6630280	and jump for joy after wiped tears as its problems are resolved.
6630920	6635160	Again, without spoiling too much though, the Sugar Rush thing kind of made up the majority
6635160	6637160	of the movie.
6637160	6640600	So I don't think kids, I don't think the references will be, I mean there's a lot of
6640600	6642680	references are going to go over the kids heads.
6642680	6647400	Like in the, in the, the baddie video game club, which is in the trailer, I'm not spoiling
6647400	6647880	anything.
6647880	6651480	The little like League of Villains baddie recovery group.
6651480	6654440	Like kids will just get that they're villains.
6654440	6655800	They'll get Zangief.
6655800	6656840	They'll get Bison.
6656840	6659640	Maybe, but they're not, the kids may not understand.
6659640	6661400	I think they'll get Pac-Man as well.
6661400	6667720	Why did, why did, why, you know, like there's a very obvious reference to Kano from Mortal
6667720	6668200	Kombat.
6668200	6669080	That is Kano.
6669080	6669480	Yeah, I know.
6669480	6671080	A very, very obvious reference.
6671080	6672600	And I don't think kids are going to get it.
6672600	6674280	The zombies from House of the Dead.
6674280	6675720	Yeah, but adults get it.
6675720	6677560	And you know who the purple rhino was?
6678120	6679240	The embossed monster beast.
6680040	6681720	With the fancy unicorns.
6681720	6683240	Yeah, with fancy unicorns.
6683240	6689000	But I mean, but I mean, for example, Becky's kid, he played Pac-Man.
6689000	6692040	He knows Pac-Man because they had a little retro arcade thing.
6692040	6693960	I mean, they have Pac-Man and Dave and Busters now.
6693960	6696200	It's the, but it's Pac-Man Battle Royale, that whole thing.
6696200	6699640	But I mean, there's, well, there's Pac-Man's in everything.
6699720	6701880	It's sort of like ingrained into society now.
6702440	6704920	All right, let's go to Facebook because we had some good answers on Facebook.
6704920	6708760	Tiger Claw says, I think Wreck-It Ralph is hands down the best video game movie ever
6708760	6709400	made.
6709400	6713880	Given how well it's doing at the box office, I would hope Disney do a sequel or maybe turn
6713880	6718360	it into an animated series a la Captain N. The film does a great job at establishing
6718360	6722920	the universe so I could totally see more stories being told inside the video game world and
6722920	6725560	show more of the video games that live inside it.
6725560	6727400	I agree and I don't agree with you.
6727400	6733400	I think there's the potential to do other movies in this universe that's been established,
6733400	6736280	but I kind of draw the line at the Captain N thing.
6736280	6740920	Remember, Mario's not in this movie because if Mario had been in the movie, it would have
6740920	6742040	been about Mario.
6742040	6745320	And the movie's not about the existing video game characters.
6745320	6749560	They just, all the existing video game characters play supporting roles and that's what's
6749560	6750280	really cool about it.
6750280	6752680	But Nintendo, a Captain N video game would be pretty awesome.
6753560	6755560	Captain N was absolute shit.
6756120	6759240	Well, they can fix all the wrongs, you know, the 80s weird stuff.
6759240	6763320	I mean, like Simon Belmont being all weird and stuff, but if they fix all that, it could
6763320	6764280	be pretty cool.
6764280	6767400	Xenocore in our chat room agrees with you, by the way, live.vognetwork.com.
6767400	6769240	He says, Captain N, the hell you say?
6769240	6770920	We can do better than Captain N.
6770920	6771640	Mega high.
6773080	6778840	Osfer says, honestly, I think Wreck-It Ralph did do well due to it being a Pixar film.
6778840	6780440	I got fooled, buddy.
6780440	6781320	He got fooled.
6781320	6782760	It looks like a Pixar film.
6782760	6784440	It was, look at the opening.
6784440	6786200	It's the Disney classic studio.
6786200	6789960	But it did have the Pixar logo right at the stop.
6790520	6792840	Because it was produced by Lasseter.
6792840	6797160	It was produced by one of the Pixar guys, although technically it's in the same, this
6797160	6802840	is the same studio that did Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and more recently
6802840	6805720	Tangled, which is a very similar film, also not Pixar.
6805720	6807320	So it was produced by Lasseter.
6807320	6807800	Right.
6807800	6812920	So, I mean, it's just, you know, this is where Disney having bought Pixar, this is where
6812920	6815400	you're really starting to see the fruits of them coming together.
6815400	6820280	But Brave was the Pixar film from this year and Monsters, you or whatever, is their big
6820280	6821080	movie next year.
6822520	6827320	And I think the next Disney movie, the Disney classic movie next year is The Frozen.
6827320	6827640	Yeah.
6827640	6828200	Right.
6828200	6829480	So, all right.
6829480	6831480	Anyhow, continuing on with Osfer's comment.
6831480	6833560	I didn't mean to, like, I'm not like calling you out or anything.
6833560	6836360	I'm just saying you made a mistake a lot of people are making.
6836440	6838760	And Pixar movies are great.
6838760	6840200	Maybe that was intentional.
6840200	6845560	You know, there really is not a bad Pixar movie unless it was a sequel to a mediocre
6845560	6846200	one.
6846200	6846520	All right.
6847080	6851080	Those are usually the most hyped up films and it's rare to turn on the TV without seeing
6851080	6852280	an ad for the movie.
6852280	6857000	It's my opinion that the movie that truly did well for video games went overlooked.
6857000	6862440	Silent Hill Revelation was the closest video game to film adaptation I've ever seen and
6862440	6865000	future video game related movies could learn from it.
6865000	6866040	Which reminds me.
6866040	6866920	We still need to go see it.
6867640	6869320	I have another friend that wants to see it too.
6869320	6869880	Okay.
6869880	6872600	So we'll try to make that happen this week.
6872600	6876600	Yeah, I can't really respond to that because I haven't seen Silent Hill Revelation still.
6877240	6878120	It's on my radar.
6878120	6879560	I want to get that scene this week.
6880280	6882680	So I'll have to come back to that next week.
6883880	6889000	DDR Dollar Bill says I would have seen it if I had power but wanted to wonder if anyone
6889000	6893400	else noticed how some reviewers were comparing this to Who Framed Roger Rabbit and that you
6893400	6896680	saw multiple characters from different franchises in the same movie.
6896680	6901640	You know, I didn't think I liked that comparison at first, but now I think I do because again
6901640	6905080	in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, none of those characters were the star.
6905880	6910920	It was about, you know, Roger Rabbit and Christopher Lloyd's wacky character and all that
6910920	6911400	stuff.
6911400	6912520	So, and Jessica Rabbit.
6912520	6914120	You can't forget Jessica Rabbit.
6914120	6915560	It was really Eddie's story.
6915560	6916680	I guess that's true.
6916680	6918520	It's been years since I've seen that movie.
6918520	6922200	If you keep in mind the story it was based off of, Roger was dead.
6924040	6928760	All right, moving on to Dark Charger who says I saw this with my young son yesterday.
6928760	6931720	It's a great video game movie and a good movie overall.
6931720	6935720	While it doesn't belong in the pantheon of animated films, it is a great love letter
6935720	6939720	to every sort of gamer, especially to those that live through the golden age of the arcade
6939720	6941800	who may enjoy this film even more.
6941800	6946600	I think that it drives strength in its narrative by not simply focusing on video games, but
6946600	6948840	by not forgetting about the characters.
6948840	6949720	It's a pretty good review.
6951000	6951800	Before I forget.
6951800	6952280	Yeah.
6952280	6955240	The original story was who censored Roger Rabbit.
6955240	6955960	I'd forgotten.
6955960	6957480	I thought it was plugged, but no word.
6957480	6958040	All right.
6958040	6960920	Chiggers replied and said, I really liked Wreck-It Ralph.
6960920	6965880	My only complaint is that I wish they would have had more of the other classic game character.
6965880	6966760	Excuse me.
6966760	6970200	I think you meant to say more of the classic game characters had more of a role.
6972520	6976840	I respect their decision to not do that because I think it would have taken away.
6977640	6983800	It was very interesting to me that one of the media supporting roles went to, and again,
6983800	6984920	I don't think this is spoiling anything.
6984920	6986040	I think I'm okay saying this.
6986040	6991160	One of the media supporting roles went to Qbert because Qbert's one of those characters
6991160	6999800	where it's like, he's not a Mario or a Sonic per se, but he's very recognizable.
6999800	7003640	If you were alive in the eighties or if you have a knowledge of eighties gaming, you know
7003640	7004520	what I mean?
7004520	7005880	Like, did you kind of feel that way, Jamie?
7005960	7009160	That was a very interesting character to have be a supporting character.
7009160	7009640	Yeah.
7009640	7011000	Yeah, but it worked.
7011800	7016360	So anyhow, let's see, moving on.
7016360	7020920	The Rob D says it's undoubtedly a great thing for video games and gamers alike.
7020920	7025800	It's the first time that a company on the scale of Disney has deftly waived a great
7025800	7029880	story involving video games without resorting to cheap sensationalism.
7029880	7034600	As a lifelong gamer, I find it refreshing to see them treated as the creative medium
7034600	7038760	and source of enjoyment for so many that they are, not something that only nerds and
7038760	7040200	basement dwellers partake in.
7040760	7042600	For me, the bottom line is this.
7042600	7046360	Wreck-It Ralph treats both video games and gamers with respect.
7046360	7050680	The people who created it did a wonderful job of capturing the joy of games and the
7050680	7052600	world's Wii gamers experience.
7052600	7056360	This is the first time that's ever happened and they should be lauded for it.
7056360	7059640	Let's hope that this is the start of a trend and not an aberration.
7059640	7061640	That's a very solid comment.
7061640	7062200	I like that.
7063160	7065720	Uh, one more comment here from Degenerate Johnny.
7066360	7068120	This is also a very interesting comment.
7068120	7071880	I like this one a lot and this is the last one I'm going to read here from Facebook.com
7071880	7073480	slash Orange Lounge Radio.
7073480	7077720	Degenerate Johnny says, I will admit that the movie was quite entertaining and I think
7077720	7081400	that it places video games in a better light, which is something the industry needs.
7081400	7085320	However, I'm not sure if Wreck-It Ralph is a good thing for the progression of video
7085320	7086040	games.
7086040	7090280	The industry has grown up considerably since its inception, but it is still considered
7090280	7094760	by many media outlets, i.e. Fox News and CNN as a child's toy.
7095400	7099560	Therefore, having a successful family-friendly video game movie may be a form of support
7099560	7103720	to those who heavily criticize the industry for its violent games.
7103720	7108280	Interactive entertainment is the entertainment of this age, as was Motion Pictures, the
7108280	7110440	entertainment of the industrial age.
7110440	7114280	Honestly, I don't think that it's fair to interpret an entertainment industry based
7114280	7117240	on its interactions with other forms of entertainment.
7117800	7122200	We don't interpret William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet through that horrid excuse
7122200	7124440	of a movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio.
7124440	7127800	The views and opinions of OLR's fans do not reflect that of OLR.
7127800	7128680	Damn right they don't.
7128680	7129640	I love that movie.
7129640	7130280	I'm sorry.
7130280	7133480	I hate that play so much because they're both stupid.
7133480	7136680	I do agree there's better Shakespeare plays than Romeo and Juliet for sure.
7136680	7136920	Really?
7136920	7137880	The theme of that?
7137880	7138680	Hi, we're stupid.
7138680	7139400	Let's kill each other.
7139400	7139720	The end.
7140680	7144840	Wreck-It Ralph was simply a fun-filled children's movie that I hope to God will only be viewed
7144840	7149720	as such if interactive entertainment is to be accepted as the next form of entertainment.
7150280	7153960	I thought that was a very interesting comment because of the whole, and this is the part
7153960	7158280	that really got me, I don't think it's fair to interpret an entertainment industry based
7158280	7161560	on its interactions with other forms of entertainment.
7161560	7163080	What do you think about that statement?
7163080	7165000	Do you think that's a good statement that he's making there?
7166120	7171320	It does seem like, it does seem like gamers, especially in gaming blogs and the things
7171320	7176280	we read on the internet, it does seem like gamers are really obsessed with how does the
7176280	7178040	news report on us?
7178040	7180600	How do we get portrayed in movies?
7180600	7186360	What, you know, it does seem like that always peaks a curiosity and in this comment that's
7186360	7190680	kind of being called out as to why do we do that?
7190680	7196360	What other industry has success measured on how it's interpreted in other forms of art?
7198280	7199720	I just thought it was a neat way of looking at it.
7201320	7205560	Mm hmm.
7207720	7211000	It's very kind of, it actually strikes me as somewhat abstract.
7211960	7212360	Yeah.
7212360	7221480	I mean, if you look at taking one genre and portraying it in another genre, then any type
7221480	7229880	of biography about artists, about, shoot, toy story, toys coming to life and, and doing
7229960	7230280	stuff.
7231800	7232760	I guess that's true.
7232760	7237000	Some, some forms of art need each other to exist.
7237000	7241640	And I might be, I might be going way off the page of what this commenter intended.
7241640	7242600	So I apologize.
7243160	7246280	But some forms of entertainment need each other to exist.
7246280	7254040	For example, music and movies, because silent movies were way different than movies today.
7254040	7259000	Hell, even when there was silent movies, you needed, uh, the piano guy sitting there at
7259000	7263480	the front playing, you know, those two industries have always really needed each other.
7263480	7266440	And some of the best music was inspired by movies.
7267000	7273000	Or have you, well, music just goes with, like, here's going to be a really dumb example.
7273000	7275320	Have you ever written California Screamin' without the soundtrack?
7276040	7276360	Yeah.
7276360	7277560	When my chair was broken.
7278520	7279960	Was it not a little different?
7279960	7281320	It was not as good.
7281320	7282040	Yeah.
7282040	7284920	Or changing the music and things.
7284920	7290360	That's why I really like how a lot of times for showing a suspenseful part in a movie
7290360	7296600	or a game, they'll just use silence instead of, you know, they'll let you focus on the
7296600	7301400	sounds going on, not just, you know, scary music to let you know it's scary.
7304040	7308520	And of course, we'll end it on this comment in the chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
7308520	7312200	Xenocore says, Rob, the answer to your question is porn.
7312520	7316920	And Robert M. also says that there are a lot of classic toys in Toy Story.
7318840	7324440	You know, what about books?
7324440	7326680	I mean, we've kind of had the Neverending Story.
7326680	7327240	What was that?
7327240	7328280	The Page Master?
7328280	7330760	I mean, that people were into that movie.
7330760	7339480	I hate to say it, you know, you had or even take comics, you know, take different genre
7339480	7342680	of story and like, for example, the whole Fable series.
7343320	7346600	Actually, you just you just really hit on something because something that's really
7346600	7352760	huge now that wasn't as big years ago was the comics and movies.
7352760	7354600	That's like a huge thing in the industry now.
7354600	7360840	And really, like before the past few years, like you would occasionally have like Superman
7360840	7366520	was huge in the 70s and like Batman was huge in the 90s, the Burton series.
7366520	7371640	But like comics are kind of big in movies now in a way we haven't seen.
7371640	7373560	I have a reason to see Guardians of the Galaxy now.
7374120	7374840	Rocket Raccoon.
7376040	7380440	Anyway, but well, the whole reason I think with that and also why I think Rocket Ralph
7380440	7389560	is doing well is that the audience, the target audience being also the same age group of
7389560	7394440	an audience that's going to have the money and, you know, maybe have kids, but also be
7394440	7395720	the people who are going to get it.
7396520	7399000	That's the ones you want to market to is our age demographic.
7400280	7405880	And on top of that, we grew up, I grew up reading X-Men and Avengers, you know, I didn't
7405880	7407560	read DC because DC sucks.
7410440	7413480	Sorry, my allergies, my sinus infections getting the best of me.
7414600	7417720	But, you know, we grew up playing these games.
7417720	7421640	It's we are at the age that we are the ones with money and the influence.
7422680	7425480	Not in the corporate world, of course, because that's bullshit.
7426200	7426700	Occupy.
7428040	7437400	But as far as what dictates what's popular in pop culture, in modern popular culture,
7438520	7439480	we're the age group.
7441240	7443880	There are too many deep discussions happening on tonight's show.
7443880	7444440	I don't understand.
7444440	7444760	What is it?
7444760	7445880	What is in the air tonight?
7445880	7448120	Where am I taking fart jokes that I came here for?
7448120	7449240	I don't get it.
7449240	7449880	Don't worry.
7449880	7451800	My next story has raccoon penis in it.
7451800	7453080	OK, phew.
7453080	7455560	Well, before we get to your story, then we got to do a couple more.
7455560	7456920	So let's get back into some news.
7456920	7460760	Loki, we will be opening up the Skype line later if you want to call and voice your opinion
7460760	7461560	on any of this.
7461560	7465400	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype, Orange Launch Radio.
7465400	7465960	Sorry, Loki.
7465960	7468520	I needed to plug that before we get to the problem.
7469160	7475800	Since a lot of the whole online plan for the Wii U has been kind of nonexistent or hidden
7475800	7481560	or secret or whatever, it is kind of refreshing to see that there's some information, including
7481560	7483240	now what their web browser is going to be.
7483240	7488280	And I don't know if there's anything to really be excited about, but well, here we go.
7488280	7494280	So basically it's based off the whole net front browser, which has been used in pretty
7494280	7501240	much all the portable gaming systems, the DS, 3DS, PSP, Vita, and of course, you know,
7501240	7501800	the Wii U.
7504040	7508760	It's based a little bit off of, you know, they've got Mozilla kind of backing a little
7508760	7510520	bit of the Apple WebKit as well.
7512120	7516360	And then a little bit of, I guess, the Nintendo browser, which is good or bad.
7516360	7518360	It will support HTML5.
7518360	7523000	Of course, no Flash because, you know, everyone's kind of saying HTML5 is the way to go anyways.
7523880	7528360	Because if we had Flash, we'd be able to play all of those virtual console games for free.
7528360	7530200	And Nintendo has to know this.
7530200	7531160	They have to know this.
7531160	7531960	Of course, of course.
7531960	7544760	It's going to support MP4 files as well as live streaming, MPEG4, AVC video, the H.2.64
7545560	7547880	format, although some may not be playable.
7547880	7556520	And of course, it will support, you know, just the regular level HTML4, 5, XHTML 1.1,
7556520	7561960	CSS 1, 2, or 2.1 and 3, although those are partially functioning.
7561960	7563560	I guess 3 is partially functioning.
7564120	7571880	And they say even like video web storage is partially functioning, web messaging, and
7572680	7573640	some other stuff there.
7576120	7580360	No plugins, obviously, because it's built into the system there.
7580360	7585240	And I guess they're saying that the browser will support some, you know, touch events
7585240	7588360	stuff like a touch, start, touch, and move, cancel.
7588360	7590760	I'm assuming it's all the stuff that you would have with a touchpad.
7590760	7591800	Here's the thing.
7591800	7595640	Will it be fast and responsive and easy?
7595640	7600600	Because the problem with so many of these browsers on the TV and all this stuff is that
7600600	7602200	they run like shit.
7602200	7605480	It's faster to just whip my phone out of my pocket and get what I need.
7605480	7613160	Well, they're saying right now that it's supposed to be, I guess, you know, it does
7613160	7614920	support HTML 5.
7614920	7621000	And I guess because it renders HTML 5 websites more effectively than any other console, and
7621000	7628360	they say even faster than Internet Explorer, they're saying that it's pretty good, I guess.
7629240	7634360	That's good because Internet Explorer on Xbox kind of blows because I mean, it's one of
7634360	7636280	the better browsers a system has had yet.
7636280	7641240	But like, it's so irritating that like when you go to vognetwork.com, even though we have
7641240	7645640	an HTML 5 player that will work on a smartphone, it will not work on the Xbox.
7645640	7649880	Like, OK, for example, they've got they have these ranking sites and I don't really know
7649880	7655080	how they got this information, but it's HTML 5 test and they have a gaming tab on there.
7655080	7661000	And right now, you know, the two I mean, there's not a lot of gaming browsers that support
7661000	7664040	HTML 5 through the 3DS and Xbox 360.
7664040	7668120	3DS got a 109, Xbox 360 is a 120.
7668120	7672680	And then, of course, the other browsers right now, I guess we does support a little bit
7672680	7678680	that we got a 94 in the DSI, a 94 in the Vita, a 58.
7679960	7685240	You know, in the course right now, they're saying, although it lists the Vita again,
7685240	7690040	I guess, for HTML 5, maybe that's like HTML 4 scores or something like that.
7690040	7694760	But for in the future or in development, the Wii U, a 323.
7695400	7699800	And I guess the Vita is a 243, I'm assuming that's maybe an update or something.
7699800	7702680	So I don't know, like I said, where they're getting their
7702680	7705880	information as far as how they're scoring that.
7705880	7710120	But. Interesting, I guess.
7711640	7715480	I'm trying to see if there's any other comparisons with like tablets.
7715480	7718120	OK, so let's let's look at tablets real quick.
7718120	7721480	And as you would expect, the tablets are better.
7722200	7725160	You know, the 323 is the Wii U's benchmark there.
7725160	7729320	And right now, you know, they have Opera Mobile 12.
7729320	7731880	That's a 406 and Chrome's 390.
7733880	7736120	Trying to see what else would be the closest there.
7737400	7740680	Even Windows Phone 8 is close 320.
7741400	7743480	IOS 6 is a 386.
7743480	7745400	Firefox mobile 388.
7745400	7750760	So it does sound like that your phone's going to be better at, you know, rendering those
7750760	7752760	pages, but it's not.
7753800	7754760	Not as bad even.
7755400	7757560	Fuck, even TV's are better at.
7758840	7761800	But for gaming out of gaming consoles, it is the best.
7762600	7763320	I don't know.
7763320	7763880	I don't know.
7763880	7766920	I don't know if that's really saying much, but all right.
7768040	7769960	When I can get my hands on it and try it.
7769960	7772840	That's when I can't really say say one way or the other.
7772840	7774200	Yeah, I just like a three.
7774200	7775320	I don't even know where they're getting.
7775320	7778520	Like it doesn't say what they're what they're testing.
7778520	7783480	I don't really know what they're testing and how how they're even testing it.
7783480	7785000	A system that's not out yet.
7786440	7786680	All right.
7786680	7791080	I have some potpourri news involving Nintendo, and it means I have a few little things I
7791080	7791800	want to get out here.
7792600	7797640	One of them is about some finally some details on what exactly the Nintendo Network premium
7797640	7798120	involves.
7798840	7803160	You remember the Wii U Deluxe Edition that has Nintendo Land as a packing game also gets
7803160	7805400	this whole Nintendo Network premium.
7805400	7807000	So what the hell is this all about?
7807000	7813480	Well, basically, you get 10% back in points that you spend on the Wii U shop.
7813480	7818600	So if you get the 32 gig Wii U with the game, you get Nintendo Network premium and you get
7818600	7822440	10% back in points if you buy a Wii U game on the eShop.
7822440	7825480	So let's say you buy a game for $59.99.
7826040	7828280	10% of that's $5.99 points.
7828280	7829400	So there you go.
7829400	7833080	You get $5 in eShop credit for every 500 points.
7833080	7840760	So, you know, basically buying a game like what?
7840760	7847880	New Super Mario Brothers Wii U online would get you enough points to buy the original
7847880	7849400	Mario Brothers on the Virtual Console.
7850760	7853160	You know, so a little something there.
7853160	7857480	It's very similar to what the Vita does already, where you get 10% off.
7857480	7862600	But that 10% that you save is not tied to their store.
7862600	7869480	It's just money in your pocket versus having this money, you know, be honestly, I don't
7869480	7871720	see downloading games as kind of an option.
7871720	7875560	I mean, I don't know, like with how fickle I get with games and stuff like that.
7875560	7879720	Like you would want to have the option to sell it back or something.
7879720	7883960	And I just there's not really much that of an incentive, I guess.
7884680	7885000	All right.
7885000	7887640	Some details coming out on New Super Mario Brothers U.
7888600	7892280	There is some more information on some of the different modes in the game,
7892360	7897640	including challenge mode, where you will have to do specific objectives like get the course
7897640	7901960	without touching the ground once or without ever picking up a coin.
7902680	7907320	There's categories that include time attack, coin collection, one up rally and special,
7907320	7909000	which is basically miscellaneous.
7909000	7912680	There's also boost mode challenges that will require two players.
7912680	7916840	Once you complete a challenge, a replay is saved so you can show that off.
7916840	7920600	There's also coin battle where up to four players will go through the course and see
7920600	7921960	who can collect the most coins.
7922440	7925240	Not unlike the recent 3DS release.
7926200	7932600	Another player can use the Wii U game pad in boost mode to place boost blocks to help
7932600	7934840	grab a hard to reach coin.
7934840	7940520	You can use the game pad to edit and customize the coin layout in dedicated courses.
7940520	7945160	That layout can then be saved and played by players using the Wii remote controllers.
7947480	7950040	At least that sounds kind of new and interesting.
7950040	7951880	I'm curious how that plays out.
7951880	7952760	Coins everywhere!
7954520	7955160	World map.
7956120	7962040	This is the first game since Super Mario World that is a seamless world map with named worlds
7962040	7965240	and courses, secret exits which can change the map.
7965240	7968600	So it sounds like it's really modeled off of Super Mario World.
7968600	7969480	Not a bad thing.
7970520	7971640	And nabbit.
7972440	7976280	A creature named nabbit from time to time will appear on the world map if you enter
7976280	7980520	the course and catch nabbit to recover items stolen from Toad.
7981160	7985720	If you get nabbit you get a P acorn which will allow you to fly continuously through
7985720	7986600	an entire stage.
7986600	7990040	I'm assuming that is like the P wing from Mario 3.
7992600	7993800	And one other thing.
7994520	7997800	You know, Loki, you give Nintendo a lot of shit on this show.
7997800	8000680	But you got to applaud Nintendo for this comment this week.
8001640	8008120	Satoru Iwata in talking about Animal Crossing New Leaf on the Nintendo 3DS mentioning all
8008120	8014760	of the download content will be free because charging consumers for the DLC would not be
8014760	8015160	cool.
8015160	8020600	Quote, that sort of element paid DLC is absolutely not being added.
8020600	8023480	He went so far as to call it unwholesome.
8023480	8027800	So basically like, you know, they could have charged for new patterns and silly.
8027800	8028600	They're not going to do it.
8029880	8033160	They thought about it, but they decided not to do it.
8034040	8038920	Loki, Nintendo's biggest critic on this show, wasn't that the right call to make?
8039560	8042840	Well, yeah, it's the most common sense call to make.
8042840	8047640	And let's be honest, the first party companies aren't really the ones that are being known
8047640	8049320	for all this on disc content.
8049320	8053640	I don't think that Sony has a whole lot of games that kind of nickel and dime you for
8053640	8054200	things.
8054200	8058840	And I don't think that Microsoft has any similar games like that as well.
8058840	8060120	So cool.
8060120	8062280	You're on equal standing with everybody else.
8062360	8063320	Third party companies.
8063320	8065320	Well, that's a whole nother story.
8065320	8068040	They're kind of in their own ruleset, I guess.
8069640	8071240	All right, let's move on.
8071240	8071880	Dar Sakura.
8073080	8077320	Well, I brought it up.
8077960	8079000	I said it was true.
8079640	8081400	This story has to do with Raccoon Penis.
8083000	8085880	What does Raccoon Penis have to do with video games?
8085880	8092920	It actually has to do with a digital art group called Massive Black.
8093560	8099880	And they've done a lot of concept art for Lord of the Rings Online, Infamous 2, Silent
8099880	8101880	Hill Shattered Memories, and Transformers 3.
8102760	8105720	They also developed their own game.
8105720	8112440	They have an artistic demo out called Moth Head that they're using to show the Unity
8112440	8112920	platform.
8113320	8117320	I downloaded this because, honestly, I had heard of the art piece that it was based off
8117320	8117880	of.
8117880	8129080	It's based off of a sculpture that is, well, it has a giant phallus on it made from the
8129080	8130840	real bone of a raccoon penis.
8132040	8136120	And if no one believes me, I will pull up the image and show everybody.
8136120	8137240	Oh, no, no, I believe you.
8137240	8137720	It's fine.
8137720	8143640	But they've done a demo called Moth Head, which is what the figure is called.
8143640	8148280	And basically, it's the figure headless with a moth attached to it.
8148280	8154440	You basically play as a moth going through this cavern, and then you merge with the creature
8155000	8161240	that looks like it was put together with different materials, and has kind of shiny insect skin.
8161240	8163640	And you solve puzzles as this creature.
8163720	8169080	It's actually supposed to be similar to, and I'm going to mispronounce this as Botanicula,
8169080	8169560	I think.
8171240	8172680	It's still a demo.
8172680	8174040	I mean, the controls aren't great.
8174040	8175080	I downloaded it.
8175720	8180200	It was originally conceived as a full length game, and they still want to do it.
8180200	8187160	But right now, it's sort of on hold while they finish their client's work, because they
8187160	8190680	still have huge groups that they're doing artwork for.
8190760	8192520	It's absolutely gorgeous to me.
8192520	8200520	I freaking love concept art, and just the fact that they would take this sculpture and
8200520	8204520	turn it into a figure in a game, just is sort of like combining two of my favorite things.
8205160	8207400	Find modern art and video games.
8207400	8212040	I'll post the link of the image in the chat room.
8213560	8214120	All right.
8214120	8215240	Let's move on, Loki.
8215240	8215740	All right.
8216600	8218840	So I don't know.
8218840	8224360	We talked about, we talked a lot about recent video, I don't even really call it a video
8224360	8226920	game movie, but a video game based movie.
8228600	8231800	Let's talk about another one that probably won't turn out as well.
8231800	8236040	And that would be Castle Wolfenstein, the movie.
8236040	8241480	Apparently, they've got Roger Avery back on his role as the writer and director for
8241480	8241980	the movie.
8242520	8247960	And this was a movie that was announced, what, five years ago?
8251080	8258120	So, yeah, I don't know if anyone's going to even remember what Castle Wolfenstein was,
8258120	8263320	at least any teenagers be seeing such a movie, but-
8263320	8264200	Doom level skip.
8266200	8266760	I don't know.
8267640	8272200	But anyways, their plot, if we must go back in there, a young U.S.
8272200	8279160	Army captain and British special agent are on a top secret mission to Castle Wolfenstein
8279160	8281160	where Hitler, who is a young U.S.
8281160	8288040	Army captain and British special agent, are on a top secret mission to Castle Wolfenstein
8288040	8291400	where Hitler will be unveiling a new secret weapon.
8292760	8293960	That sounds awfully generic.
8293960	8296760	Does this mean the Hitler robot that was the boss of one of the-
8296760	8297400	I hope so.
8297400	8297960	Oh, boy.
8299560	8300440	It could be.
8300440	8302040	I think it could be dumb fun.
8302040	8304120	As long as it's not attached to it, which he is.
8304120	8305160	Emphasis on dumb.
8306520	8307020	Yeah.
8308200	8308520	All right.
8308520	8310280	Well, I think this is kind of neat.
8310280	8316360	Now, you know, Sega is no stranger to repackaging their old shit and they've done it a lot, a
8316360	8317080	lot.
8317080	8323640	And, you know, the various collections, whether it be download, PC, or these little hook them
8323640	8325640	up directly to your TV things, right?
8327000	8329080	There's a new one on the way out.
8329080	8334040	It's called the Sega Genesis Ultimate Portable Game Player, and it's coming out November
8334040	8334600	13th.
8334600	8337160	It's going to cost $59.99.
8337160	8341080	That's 60 bucks for a Genesis, but it has 80 games built in.
8341080	8342440	That was fakely like a nomad.
8343320	8346040	37 of them are going to be from Sega.
8346040	8346600	Oh, I'm sorry.
8346600	8347080	It is not.
8347080	8349320	It's this one that you plug into your TV.
8349320	8351000	No, it looks like a portable system, doesn't it?
8351000	8351720	Might be both.
8351720	8352680	It could be both.
8353400	8354760	Do it with the nomad.
8355640	8355880	Yeah.
8355880	8357080	I'm trying to see real quick at that.
8358040	8358600	I'm not sure.
8358600	8365080	Anyway, there's 37 of these games from Sega, three from Capcom, and 40 from assortment
8365080	8366440	of other publishers.
8366440	8367240	Here's the thing.
8367240	8372600	One of those Capcom games that's going to be on this player, Mega Man, the Wily Wars.
8373560	8379080	Now, if you don't know what this game is, it's remakes of the first three Mega Mans
8379080	8384360	on the NES, along with a game called Wily Tower, like a little mini game.
8384920	8387160	It only ever actually came out in Japan and Europe.
8387720	8394040	It was on the Sega channel in the US, but how many people actually had the Sega channel?
8394040	8397160	So most people missed this when it was first out.
8397160	8401400	So it's very interesting that all these years later, the Wily Wars is actually going to
8401400	8401720	be out.
8401720	8405960	Now, I'm sure half of you out there have already emulated this at this point, but it's
8405960	8410760	still worth saying that this is on its way out and who knows what else, what other goodies
8410760	8411320	could be in there.
8411320	8413960	The only way we know about this one is it's on the box.
8413960	8415400	So who knows what else is in there?
8415400	8417480	That's pretty awesome.
8418040	8419880	That really is, honestly.
8419880	8420760	I mean, I've played it.
8420760	8421160	It's fun.
8421720	8422120	Yeah.
8422120	8424760	I remember the first three games are great.
8424760	8429720	Now, granted, there was also that PlayStation 2 GameCube collection that was also the...
8429720	8432680	And wasn't that the Wily Wars versions of the game?
8432680	8433640	Correct me if I'm wrong.
8433640	8434680	It's been a long time.
8436920	8439400	It's a 2.8 inch LCD screen.
8439400	8440840	It's a handheld player.
8440840	8445080	Rechargeable battery built in, USB cable included for charging battery.
8445080	8446600	Doesn't look like you can hook it up to the TV.
8446600	8448440	I still recommend Power Battle.
8450440	8451080	You never know.
8453320	8453960	All right.
8453960	8454600	So there you go.
8455720	8457960	Something new all these years later in the US.
8458600	8459800	Let's go to the email bag.
8459800	8464040	Every week we collect your emails at mailbag at orangelawntrader.com.
8464040	8465000	All one of them.
8465000	8465640	All one of them.
8465640	8468440	The Darkstalker is going to dive into the email bag and say,
8468440	8469160	Hello.
8469160	8469560	Hello.
8470120	8471240	And then she'll look on the ground.
8471240	8473480	Oh, one lone little email in here.
8473480	8475400	It got stuck to my toes.
8475400	8477560	Let me just reach down here and pick it up.
8478520	8481880	And she'll read that one email on the air here tonight.
8481880	8482680	And here it is.
8483640	8488680	I see that the stores have Wreck-It Ralph toys, but only three characters in the first wave.
8488680	8493320	Ralph Fix-It Felix Jr. and Ralph in the Hero's Duty armor.
8494120	8494520	Duty.
8495240	8499080	I understand why they can't flood the shelves of Bowser's, Clyde's and Cubert's.
8499720	8501480	Who even holds that license now?
8501480	8505080	I know a New York holding company licenses the Gotlight Pinball Tables.
8505080	8507320	But what about the arcade cabinet games?
8507320	8511480	But right now more of the movie's original characters seem to be Disney Store only.
8512120	8516440	And just to ask Loki, seriously this time, you mentioned suffering from weekend headaches.
8517160	8519160	This is something affecting me as well.
8519160	8520920	So what does your doctor think is causing it?
8520920	8522040	Allergies or stress maybe?
8522840	8524040	No, it'll go my doctor.
8525880	8528360	I think it's honestly, it's a combination of a bunch of things.
8528360	8533960	I think it's, it may be the fact that I wake up like every hour, a couple hours at night.
8533960	8538200	And it could be my pillow is just really uncomfortable sometimes or, you know.
8538520	8541000	Um, I should show you the pillow that I use.
8541000	8542200	It got rid of most of my headaches.
8542760	8546600	Loki also gets a lot of stress caused by this show because he
8546600	8549240	pops blood vessels every time a Nintendo story comes up.
8549240	8549880	Let's be real.
8549880	8551240	I've seen that eye twitch.
8552280	8553400	That comes from Robert M.
8554040	8557480	Um, the first part of the thing about the licensed toys.
8557480	8561080	Um, I think honestly that just would have cost Disney extra money.
8561080	8565960	Disney doesn't want to push other people's properties.
8565960	8568040	They want to push their own properties.
8568040	8571080	And remember, and I don't know if you've actually seen the movie yet or what have you,
8571080	8575640	but remember the movie just uses all these licensed stuff to
8576200	8580840	kind of get you into the plot that involves characters that are not based off of real games.
8580840	8583720	So of course Disney wants to build their own characters.
8584280	8587960	So, you know, I think, I think that's what it really boils down to.
8588600	8593320	So, but I think you're right about it does seem like a lot of the characters they did use again
8593320	8598520	were, and a lot of the references were not necessarily the most popular games.
8598520	8602200	I mean, they're, they're recognizable games that doesn't make them the most popular.
8602200	8604200	For example, Dark Soccer already mentioned earlier in the show,
8604200	8606520	there's a reference to roadblasters in the movie.
8606520	8612440	I think everybody recognizes roadblasters, but did roadblasters really have that same
8613320	8616440	financial impact and did it make that same kind of money
8616440	8620280	that maybe other comparable racing games did like pole position per se?
8620920	8624280	Probably not. Or Iron Man, Off-Road, Stewart, that whole thing.
8624280	8626280	Probably not. But everybody recognizes it.
8626280	8629560	So I think there were just some really smart choices in what was used.
8629560	8632520	And because I'm sure somebody is going to mention it if I don't,
8632520	8634760	there's even a DDR reference in the very beginning.
8635800	8639000	Nobody's really playing DDR or anything. It's just the DDR.
8639000	8642280	Uni is the one that calls out and it's in one of the trailers.
8642280	8646200	Uni is the one that kind of calls out the arcades closed, you know, that type of thing.
8646200	8652120	So, you know, and again, I doubt Uni cost an arm and a leg to license.
8652120	8655240	I think there is an actual DDR machine in the movie.
8655240	8655640	It is.
8655640	8656200	Yeah, there is.
8656200	8657960	There's an X2 machine, if I remember correctly.
8657960	8658760	Right at the start.
8658760	8661160	They licensed the likeness from Konami, I'm sure.
8661160	8664120	But that probably cost them a hell of a lot less than
8664120	8666600	licensing Simon Belmont would have cost, you know?
8667160	8669800	So they're smart.
8669800	8675960	Uh, Robert M in chat says, and technically, yes, but what I was saying was
8675960	8680280	hope and hopefully vanilla girl and Sergeant Calhoun will be later characters.
8680280	8681000	Oh, well, yes.
8681000	8683080	I, I hope, I hope they are too.
8683080	8684200	Vanellope Von Schweetz.
8684200	8685160	Is that what you're talking about?
8686360	8687000	You know what?
8687560	8690840	She also made me think of Penelope Pitstop because the name was similar.
8691640	8694920	Even if Sarah Silverman annoys the shit out of you,
8694920	8696920	which I know she's a very controversial comedian.
8696920	8699720	I think she's hilarious, but I, I understand that she really
8699720	8701720	is like nails on a chalkboard to some people.
8701720	8703800	She does a really good job voicing that character.
8703800	8706600	She, she was a really good pick for that character because
8706600	8709720	that character is supposed to be a little bit nails on chalkboard,
8710520	8712600	but I thought that was a really good pick.
8712600	8715640	In fact, all the voice actors were really good.
8716200	8719880	Jane Lynch, especially was a great choice for that character.
8720520	8721320	She was perfect.
8721320	8721560	Yeah.
8721560	8725000	And, and, uh, the, the 30 Rock guy as Fix-It Felix.
8725000	8726920	I mean, this is, they were all very great, great picks.
8728200	8728760	All right.
8728760	8731960	Uh, since that's it for the emails, shame, shame.
8731960	8733720	Mailbag at orange lounge, radio.com.
8733720	8735880	Send us more emails to read next week.
8735880	8738680	In the meantime, and don't tell us about, you know,
8738680	8741000	inheriting money from some guy in England.
8741000	8741400	Yes.
8741400	8745800	Or your, you know, pyramid scheme or the French spam has to stop.
8746920	8747880	And the French spam.
8749160	8749960	All right.
8749960	8751720	Viva la French spam.
8752120	8752120	
8753000	8753560	All right.
8753560	8756520	Speaking of things that make us angsty, like French spam,
8757320	8764120	it's time for the FUs of the week.
8774600	8779080	My FUs are, first of all, to the end of my sinus infection,
8779960	8782360	to, uh, origin.
8782360	8787080	Well, actually specifically the patch for mass effect three and EA's customer
8787080	8792760	service was keeping me from being able to play my game without restriction and
8792760	8796120	all of it, but really I can't play it at all.
8797080	8804280	Um, and, uh, I had another one, but I'm distracted by raccoon penis.
8804280	8815480	Um, I guess just F you to, um, I'll F you to this whole week because we're
8815480	8818440	in the whole crux of like the fourth quarter stuff.
8818440	8827240	And fortunately in the position of distribution, um, see distribution
8827240	8832520	right now, it seems like they don't get call of duty black ops too early enough.
8832520	8837400	So the independent stores get theirs for midnight launch, which pisses off
8837400	8841240	everybody and keeps having those people ask, how am I supposed to stay in
8841240	8843320	business and compete against games?
8843320	8845400	It's like, listen, I'm not your fucking person.
8845400	8847720	That's supposed to tell you that if I told you that that'd be running your
8847720	8848040	store.
8848760	8850040	I'm not running your store.
8850040	8852200	I don't get paid enough to run your store.
8852200	8856680	You don't go up to, you know, you'll own a restaurant and go to your butcher
8856680	8857400	wherever you go out.
8857400	8860680	Why can't I compete with these other restaurant chains?
8860680	8861640	You know, it doesn't make any sense.
8862280	8863080	So it's annoying.
8863080	8867000	And on top of all that, the rest of my coworkers, sales staff gets to go to
8867000	8869080	Napa for fun three day weekend.
8870200	8878440	But because I landlocked the wife, I do not get to go to Napa.
8878440	8880680	Not that I was enjoying that because it's all wine tasting.
8880680	8882200	I fucking hate wine.
8882200	8883320	So I like wine.
8883320	8884360	No, I don't like wine.
8884360	8886200	See, I was excited about it cause I was like, sweet.
8886200	8888520	Second day is usually kind of that whole fun.
8888520	8890360	You get to go do whatever you want.
8890360	8893640	Well, they have like activities planned out, but now they only have one activity
8893640	8894840	and it's wine tasting.
8894840	8896920	See, my activity would be fuck all the activities.
8896920	8900920	I'm driving to Menlo Park and I'm going to go to fucking Cuzar.
8902120	8904440	But, uh, no, that's not gonna happen.
8904440	8905080	So it's fine.
8907000	8908840	Um, I don't know.
8908840	8912440	I have general angst this week, but not things I can really put into words.
8912440	8913640	Just stuff and things.
8913640	8917240	So F you to stuff things.
8918200	8919000	That's all you get.
8920520	8921080	All right.
8921080	8925640	Uh, let's move on to a few more quick news stories and then we're going to get to your
8925640	8930840	calls at 1-877-GAMO-LR and Orange Lounge Radio, all one word on Skype.
8930840	8932360	But first, two more stories for you.
8932360	8932840	Loki.
8932840	8937480	Well, we talked last week about some closures regarding, uh, Zynga and some of their Zynga
8937480	8939480	properties kind of going buh-bye.
8939480	8947080	So the first of those properties to be kind of going away, which goes to show how much
8947080	8950920	of this I'm actually, um, interested in, which is none of it.
8950920	8952040	Um, Fishville.
8953240	8955720	I mean, seriously, this whole Ville thing's got to stop.
8955720	8961400	I mean, it looks, it just sounds stupid, but Fishville and Treasure Isle are the first
8961400	8965240	two games, um, that will be kind of going by.
8965240	8970280	And, uh, this, they're going to stop running, um, on December 5th.
8970920	8977240	And I guess Fishville is a game where people fish.
8977240	8978840	I don't really, or are fish.
8978840	8980040	Imagine that.
8980040	8980440	I don't know.
8980440	8984120	It's, it's, I don't care.
8984120	8985480	Yeah, I really don't.
8985480	8987240	Um, yeah.
8988360	8994760	But they do refer to their players as Fishville-ers as, uh, this email from the Fishville team.
8995560	8996060	Yeah.
8996680	8997180	Hmm.
8997820	8999100	All right.
8999100	9000540	One more story for you guys.
9000540	9003580	Here's one for the classic OLR fans.
9003580	9006860	Uh, DDR Classroom Edition.
9006860	9009740	There's some extra information coming out about DDR Classroom Edition.
9009740	9009980	That's right.
9009980	9015340	That's kind of where DDR lives on now is in PE programs in schools, which I think is great.
9015340	9018780	You know, it's a great way to get kids involved in Dance Dance Revolution.
9018780	9021020	Here's the interesting thing about DDR Classroom Edition.
9021020	9023660	It's probably better than any other version of the game.
9023660	9030220	300 songs in the song list, including like some weird songs.
9030220	9034460	Songs have never been in DDR from like Walk It Out.
9034460	9036220	You know Konami did that game Walk It Out.
9036220	9038540	There's some songs from Walk It Out that are going to be in the game.
9039180	9041900	New tracks from 0039.com.
9041900	9046540	New dance mania licenses and several licenses from Sony Music Entertainment.
9046540	9047040	What?
9048700	9052380	Apparently going to get new music updates every three to six months.
9052380	9056700	After some successful location tests in Southern California and some schools there.
9057580	9059660	They're being very aggressive about the title.
9059660	9067980	Too bad it's something for schools and not for people to like actually get.
9067980	9071900	Well, here's the thing though is I think a lot of this stuff that they're probably licensing
9071900	9076460	for the Dance, uh, the Classroom Edition is probably going to end up in Dance Dance Revolution.
9076460	9079500	The fourth or fifth reboot of the franchise.
9079500	9080700	Oh, the new one coming out.
9080700	9083340	I think that'd be my guess because they're doing too many licenses.
9083340	9086780	I doubt they would dump that much money into a Classroom Edition,
9086780	9088940	which really doesn't need a diverse.
9089740	9095900	I mean, if you think about it, do you really need a diverse soundtrack for the Classroom Edition?
9096780	9099820	I mean, most, I'm assuming most of the stuff is going to be picked by the,
9100380	9103500	you know, the teacher in the class and no one's going to go,
9103500	9109100	Oh my goodness, I really want to hear that song by the Screaming Masks or
9110940	9111740	Trailers.
9111740	9114300	There's a pink song, So What?
9114300	9115660	I've heard that song on the radio.
9116460	9118540	Natasha Bedingfield, Pocket Full of Sunshine,
9118540	9123020	although I think wasn't that in the DDR release on the most recent PlayStation?
9123020	9123500	I don't know.
9125820	9130060	Chris Brown's song, you know, because they really should encourage his stuff in schools.
9130700	9134220	Uh, yeah, that's a huge song list though.
9134220	9136220	397 songs looking at the PDF.
9136220	9137660	But the question is-
9137660	9138860	I'm sure it ain't cheap.
9139500	9144860	Question is, and you know, thankfully they have this totally not sorted by artists.
9145900	9146780	Is Holic in the game?
9148700	9149980	Is Holic in there?
9149980	9150940	Holic is not in there.
9150940	9151980	At least I didn't see it.
9151980	9153260	Maybe future DLC.
9153980	9155020	Hot Limit though is.
9156460	9156960	Awesome.
9157980	9159340	You say Dramamine.
9159900	9161820	All right, uh, let's go to the phones.
9161820	9165980	1877 Game OLR or a username on Skype is Orange Lounge Radio.
9165980	9167820	The phones are now open.
9168860	9170060	You can give us a call.
9170060	9174620	I'm gonna go to the Twitter topics, but I gotta grab my iPad.
9174620	9177260	Loki, do you have any last minute stories?
9177900	9179500	No, I was just checking out-
9179500	9180000	Shit.
9181660	9182460	Stop it.
9182460	9184620	I was just checking out some of the songs that are in here.
9184620	9186700	I was just, you know, seeing what they've got here and-
9188140	9189260	I'm sorry, I was asleep.
9190140	9194540	They've got, um, they really don't have this in any sort of order.
9195180	9198300	But, uh, I'm trying to see if Holic is in here.
9198300	9199980	Holic is the best song ever.
9199980	9201420	They have, uh, Silent Hill.
9201420	9203180	Thomas Howard, you know, for Christmas.
9203180	9203900	So that's kind of cool.
9204540	9205040	Um.
9206380	9208620	Is that what happens in school now during the winter?
9208620	9210460	Is like DDR time?
9210460	9213100	You know, I think it'd be fucking awesome.
9213820	9215660	It would be really awesome to have that.
9215660	9219500	Because it was what Ultimate, like, it was like dodgeball or something like that.
9220220	9221420	What the hell did we used to do?
9221420	9222700	Play basketball maybe?
9222700	9223660	We used to do square dancing.
9223660	9224540	Yeah, we used to do square dancing.
9224540	9225660	Square dancing was the best.
9227340	9227900	You're weird.
9228780	9231500	I, it was the one thing I was good at.
9233100	9234220	Grab your partner.
9234220	9235260	That and pickleball.
9235260	9236540	Did you guys ever play pickleball?
9236540	9237180	No.
9237180	9238140	That was the other thing.
9238140	9241580	It was like, it was like tennis, but kind of like dumbed down a little bit.
9241580	9245180	We had, we had a game that we would play that was called Sink the Bismarck.
9245820	9246320	What?
9246940	9249020	After the ship from the World War.
9249580	9256380	But, um, but basically it was a, but you had two sides and you had a few students in the,
9256380	9259580	um, middle and they were the land, they were the water mines.
9260220	9263260	And so the students were all the ships crossing the ocean.
9263980	9268620	And if one of the land mines managed to touch, or not land mines, but the water mines
9268620	9271580	managed to touch one of the other students, then they became a mine and they had to stop
9271580	9272540	where they were.
9272540	9274860	And until the last one left was the winner.
9275660	9276160	So.
9279900	9282060	I just remember every Friday we had to run the mile.
9283020	9289420	Uh, let's see, going to Twitter topics at, uh, twitter.com slash O L R.
9289420	9294300	Um, thankfully there's no, let them move as to share 100.
9294300	9295340	Matt linked us this story.
9295340	9299500	I thought this was in our show role, but I think it just might've made not made this,
9299500	9300860	uh, this week.
9300860	9301500	I don't know.
9301500	9304220	Take two is going to be opening a new Las Vegas office.
9304220	9304460	Yeah.
9304460	9306780	You know, it was one of the stories you posted that we just didn't get to tonight.
9306780	9311100	Cause you, you talked to grand theft auto somewhere else, but, uh, yeah, 150 jobs in
9311100	9316140	Las Vegas, a brand new downtown office, Las Vegas region development agency is offering
9316140	9318540	up $600,000 in incentives to take two.
9318540	9324540	If they open the branch, I'm telling you, man, Vegas is a pretty awesome cause everyone
9324540	9327660	really thinks of Vegas is kind of like, Ooh, casinos and stuff like that.
9327660	9331340	But it's actually a pretty cool suburb with like really cheap housing.
9331980	9332860	And it's not bad.
9332860	9336940	If like you're not into the whole casino thing, it's still like a nice suburb.
9336940	9340300	I'm not sure if everybody who lives there would agree with you, but let's go to the
9340540	9340860	scene.
9340860	9341820	Like a nice suburb.
9341820	9342220	I don't know.
9342220	9342940	Hi, you're on orange.
9342940	9343500	Don's radio.
9343500	9343900	Who's this?
9344620	9346460	Uh, a survivor of the hurricane.
9346460	9347020	Ranma.
9347020	9348300	Hey, so you came out.
9348300	9348700	Okay.
9348700	9348940	Huh?
9349500	9349740	Yeah.
9349740	9350380	Pretty much.
9350380	9354700	Um, one of our studios, AKA Joe big day, uh, she lost power for a few days, but other
9354700	9356380	than that came out pretty good.
9356380	9359980	Well, you know, a lot worse things could happen than losing power for a few days.
9359980	9365980	I'm, I'm glad to hear places are recovering, you know, it's, it's, it's really tragic
9365980	9369500	seeing a lot of the stuff that's happening along the New Jersey shore and all that.
9369500	9375740	Like all the jokes about reality TV aside, like seeing that roller coaster just submerged
9375740	9380780	in water is just like, like jaw on floor type of thing.
9380780	9383100	It's just, it's, it's, it's upsetting.
9383100	9389660	But, um, you know, I know the photos of the train station is right by my house in the
9389660	9391900	one few little bit down the way.
9391900	9393660	So, you know, water had me spazzing.
9393660	9398620	And then like on Wednesday when he started saying, you can take trains, you can take
9398700	9399580	some of the buses.
9399580	9403580	Me and a couple of friends went down to Coney Island to survey some of the damage.
9403580	9404460	I saw the pictures.
9404460	9407420	It didn't seem like it was that bad.
9408540	9410700	Truth is it really wasn't.
9410700	9412380	It was just mostly water.
9412380	9415180	The beach itself was just, just wrecked.
9415180	9420620	Um, I did shoot video and one of the people I had spoken with, he said the main thing,
9420620	9426940	reason why most of Coney Island came out intact is because the, where the hurricane was coming
9426940	9429420	it wasn't coming in from the, from where the beach is.
9429420	9431100	It was coming in from...
9431100	9433900	It was coming up through land, wasn't it?
9434540	9435180	Say what?
9435180	9436460	Wasn't it coming up through land?
9437180	9437900	Yeah, pretty much.
9437900	9438140	Yeah.
9438140	9443740	So all the shops along Coney Island, like before you hit the beach, they took the brunt
9443740	9444460	end of everything.
9444460	9446780	By the time it got up, there was just really just a mass of wind.
9447820	9448780	Yeah, pretty much.
9448780	9452380	And now they're talking about another storm coming our way in about two days.
9452380	9453660	Oh, goodie.
9453740	9456940	Well, this is why you're supposed to fill your bathtub with water, have bleach, get
9456940	9458140	canned food, buy all the bread.
9458860	9459660	Tape your windows.
9461180	9465340	I did all of that and we had a big ol', a big ol' bucket of hurricane to drink.
9467420	9471020	But, but I, but I will tell you, welcome to my childhood.
9471020	9474060	Rama, I'm sure you didn't just call in to talk about the storm, but thank you for the
9474060	9474860	update.
9474860	9475820	What's on your mind tonight?
9476380	9483820	Um, my issues with Xbox and banning people for names and insults and stuff.
9483820	9487020	I mean, I kind of see both points on this.
9487020	9492460	It just feels like this is no different from being in high school and you're being bullied
9492460	9496940	and you're hearing N word, F word, K, all this, all this stuff.
9496940	9505020	And it's like, if you run your, if you go, go report it, this happens, that happens.
9505020	9510780	In a way, I kind of feel like, you know, just let them handle, let them handle their own
9510780	9511820	business, you know?
9512460	9517100	But on the same token, if it's just a bunch of friends running their mouth, having a good
9517100	9521180	time, you got that one person coming in, starting to freak out and then all hell breaks loose.
9521180	9521340	Yeah.
9521340	9524380	But if you're going to play with your friends, why would you let that one person in anyway?
9525100	9528860	Because you know, it's always in that, in the group is like, you always bring that one
9528860	9530300	person and like, Oh, don't worry.
9530300	9530940	He's cool.
9530940	9531500	He's understanding.
9531500	9532380	Oh, she's cool.
9532380	9533420	She's understandable.
9533420	9536220	And then you're like, and you find a little, Oh shit.
9536220	9540540	Or back in the day when we do PSO and only three of us were online and we wanted a fourth
9540540	9545660	to do, uh, the full challenge, we would, uh, just go to open lobby, the three of us and
9545660	9546860	pull another person.
9546860	9547100	Yeah.
9547100	9551340	You can kind of, um, also one thing to remember about the Xbox 360, cause we've done this
9551340	9556140	with Mass Effect 3 a lot is that you can go into party mode and you can chat in the little
9556140	9561260	party chat that's on your crossbar or whoops, that's the Sony thing, whatever they call
9561420	9564620	the, you know, the main interface on Xbox dashboard, it's on your dashboard.
9564620	9567980	So like, you know, like Shane and I might be playing Mass Effect and maybe we have,
9567980	9570540	you know, acidic vampire, Oscar, somebody with us.
9570540	9574700	It's like the three of us will be in the party chat and then we'll bring in a random fourth,
9574700	9579180	but they can't hear us because we're in the party chat and that dialogue doesn't go out
9579180	9579660	in game.
9579660	9582780	So, you know, we have to remember the Xbox does have that infrastructure set up.
9582780	9586460	So if you do want to bring in randoms to fill out your party, you know, you can still have
9586460	9589660	your closed conversation without worrying about offending some stranger.
9591500	9592380	There we go.
9592380	9592620	Yeah.
9592620	9596300	So that is, that's the solution, but still, I, I still get what you're saying, you know,
9596300	9601020	where, you know, you don't want that one per, cause still you could be bringing somebody
9601020	9607900	into your little party chat that maybe you kind of didn't estimate correctly and maybe
9607900	9608940	we'll take offense.
9608940	9615900	But I think, I don't know, I guess Microsoft to some extent maybe has a, has a responsibility
9615900	9619820	to not regulate private games the same way they would regulate a public game.
9620060	9621260	Well, that works for me.
9621260	9626060	Just like if I want to say in the privacy of my own home, I want to say every offensive
9626060	9628620	word I can think of and believe me, I know a lot of them.
9628620	9631420	If I want to say those in the privacy of my own home where nobody ever hears them, but
9631420	9633740	Alan, you know, that's between Alan and I, right?
9634300	9635180	Yep.
9635180	9640220	Although some would argue it's toxic to use those words in any circumstance, but that's
9640220	9642140	a debate for another time, I suppose.
9642140	9642940	Yes, definitely.
9644940	9647260	So gosh, anything else still on your mind tonight, buddy?
9647900	9650780	A friend of mine did a voice in Wreck-It Ralph.
9650780	9651580	Oh really?
9651580	9652140	What voice?
9652140	9652620	Do you know?
9653340	9654140	He was Ryu.
9655180	9656140	Get out!
9656140	9657740	That's awesome.
9658940	9662300	It was a quick scene, but it was, it was funny.
9662300	9663180	Everybody laughed.
9664300	9665180	That's very cool.
9665180	9668380	And if everything goes according to plan, I'll be going to see it this week dressed
9668380	9669980	as Luigi and I will have pictures.
9669980	9670620	There you go.
9670620	9673500	Even though sadly, I'm sad to report, Luigi's not in the movie.
9673500	9674540	It doesn't matter.
9674540	9675500	It doesn't matter.
9675500	9677500	Luigi's still number one, super guy.
9680460	9683100	Well, we need, so you haven't seen Wreck-It Ralph yet?
9683100	9683980	No, I have not.
9683980	9686620	Well, we do need the movie to be black Luigi approved.
9686620	9688140	So, um, you know.
9688140	9689420	So will the Wii U launch.
9691260	9692860	We need stories from the Wii U launch.
9692860	9695100	I don't, I don't, I don't know what's going on here.
9695100	9698620	Like I, everything about this launch is very mysterious to me.
9698620	9700860	Like, I don't, like, it seems like it's all done in pre-orders.
9700860	9702220	Like, are people even camping out?
9702220	9703580	Is that a thing anymore?
9704060	9705260	People are camp.
9706620	9708300	My younger brother, Greg.
9708300	9711980	He, upon hearing about the pre-orders and all of this, he sends me a message.
9712700	9715900	You are coming with me to camp out for the Wii U, right?
9716460	9717580	I guess.
9717580	9719180	You are coming, right?
9719180	9719900	Okay.
9719900	9721020	I will be there.
9721020	9722140	Just save me some soup.
9722860	9723980	I don't want to camp out.
9723980	9726380	I just want to go on Amazon and have him ship it.
9726380	9727580	Like, I'm just lazy.
9728380	9729900	I'm too old to camp out.
9730700	9731980	You haven't ordered it yet?
9732780	9733580	I don't care.
9733580	9734460	And I don't want one.
9735420	9738380	I'm hoping I have connections that can help me get one.
9738380	9740540	Well, I plan on getting one, so.
9740540	9741020	There you go.
9741020	9742700	Well, you have to let us know how it is.
9742700	9743500	Oh, by the way.
9744140	9746620	I'm just, I'm buying it so I can just put it on eBay.
9748540	9750140	One thing real quick about Wreck-It Ralph.
9751020	9755100	The little film at the very beginning of it will give you sniffles.
9755740	9757740	It was so paper man.
9757740	9758700	The little short.
9758700	9759820	Cause that's like a thing now.
9759820	9763420	A lot of the Pixar movies and Disney, even Disney classics have these shorts in front of them.
9763420	9763900	Yeah, it was really good.
9763900	9766380	It was called paper man and it was really sweet.
9766380	9767260	It was cute.
9767260	9768140	It was cute.
9768140	9768460	All right.
9769100	9772380	Referring paper man to slender man, but I'll be it from me.
9772380	9772620	All right.
9772620	9774540	Well, Rama, we're going to let you go so we can get some more calls.
9774540	9775180	Okay.
9775180	9775500	All right.
9775500	9775820	Cool.
9775820	9776060	All right.
9776060	9776860	Bye.
9776860	9777360	Bye.
9779020	9780460	Always nice to hear from Rama.
9780460	9784780	One of the hosts of anime jam session Tuesdays on the voice of geeks network.
9784780	9788940	Although I didn't mention this during the show, but some of you probably picked on or I picked
9788940	9793580	up on this, our feed was down for like four days this week.
9793580	9794700	It was pretty crazy.
9795260	9798460	So some of our programming got rolled over to next week.
9798460	9799580	Critical myth.
9799580	9804940	We'll be back, uh, next week with some of the episodes that got missed due to the outage.
9804940	9808940	I think the Warcraft shows, unfortunately, they're just going to have to be missed.
9809740	9811260	But anyway, we got another call coming in.
9811260	9812220	So let's go to the phones.
9812220	9813260	Hi, you're on orange launch radio.
9813260	9813660	Who's this?
9814620	9816860	Hey guys, it's the one and only degenerate Johnny.
9817660	9819020	What is up degenerate Johnny?
9819020	9821580	You wrote that comment on Facebook earlier, right?
9821580	9822140	Yes, I did.
9822140	9824460	I called into follow up on that.
9824460	9825020	Please do.
9826460	9826780	All right.
9826780	9835500	So basically it seems to me that, you know, gaming in the culture that we live today,
9836140	9839900	it still hasn't really gotten it through these people's heads.
9839900	9846620	I mean, look back a few years back, um, Fox news, you know, I geeked out when Fox news
9846620	9849980	was saying, Oh yeah, we're going to have a, we're going to talk about mass effect.
9849980	9851580	I'm like, Oh my goodness.
9851580	9856380	And it was nothing but a bash fest over that 30 second love scene.
9856380	9859020	I'm like, what the hell is this crap?
9859020	9864060	Of which, of which there is much worse stuff shown on Fox television.
9865260	9866460	Like, exactly.
9866460	9870140	You know, I mean, good.
9870140	9870860	Oh, that's it.
9870860	9875260	Just, I was just saying like glee and house and all those shows have far worse content.
9876060	9876380	Right.
9876380	9876860	Exactly.
9876860	9882460	And even their quote unquote expert, uh, Cooper Lawrence said it herself that she saw, you
9882460	9888060	know, sayings and loss that were actually more explicit than that love scene, you know.
9889980	9897580	But, you know, it seems, it seems amazing to me that, you know, nothing has evolved
9897580	9900700	ever since, you know, 1993.
9900700	9906620	This is where I think the gaming industry has evolved from a child's toy was the moment
9906620	9912940	that Congress approached the electronic software association after Mortal Kombat and Doom and
9912940	9914460	saying, Hey, you know what?
9914460	9920300	We appreciate, you know, what you guys are doing, but now your content has more than
9920300	9921820	one form of audience.
9921820	9924060	You have to separate it.
9924060	9930460	And, you know, from that point, I think that was a turning point from us being a child's
9930460	9936620	toy or a fad into actually becoming, you know, the next form of entertainment.
9938380	9941660	And well, let me, let me, let me throw this out there just to be devil's advocate.
9941660	9944540	It's not that I disagree with you, but I want to throw this thought out here and see what
9944540	9948620	you think about this because 20 years ago, which, you know, 93 was almost 20 years ago
9948620	9954300	at this point, another industry that faced a lot of battles in Congress was the music
9954300	9955180	industry.
9955180	9959420	And this is because gangster rap started to take a storm a little bit.
9959420	9963420	And this is where that whole little black and white sticker that says parental advisory
9963420	9965340	caution explicit lyrics came from.
9965340	9968300	And a lot of this is perpetuated by the same person between the two.
9968300	9968540	Yeah.
9968540	9969100	Hilarious.
9969100	9969580	Right.
9969580	9976620	But, but, but, well, you know, where it came from regardless, you know, music doesn't get
9976620	9982860	that same, pardon the pun, rap that video games does and being accepted in mainstream
9982860	9983260	culture.
9983260	9988060	Although I guess one could argue, there's still a lot of people that say gangster rap's
9988060	9988940	not music.
9988940	9989740	It's garbage.
9990860	9994540	There's people out there that feel that way, whether they're right or wrong.
9994540	9999180	So I, you know, it's, it's just interesting to me that, you know, music fought a lot of
9999180	10000940	that stuff in the nineties too.
10000940	10001260	Yet.
10002220	10006700	Oh, I mean, it fought, it fought against that battle, you know, way before then.
10006700	10010220	I mean, hell, the Beatles were, were considered the devil's music.
10011340	10012700	Play the records backwards.
10012700	10013020	Remember?
10014060	10014300	Yeah.
10015740	10019980	I was like, how am I worshiping the devil when I'm hearing, I want to hold your hand.
10019980	10020460	What the hell?
10021740	10026460	Because it's you, it's you wanting to hold the devil's hand as you walk through the lakes
10026460	10028140	of fire in a fiery hell.
10029020	10030700	Oh, dear Lord, Lordy.
10030700	10031580	Oh my goodness.
10034620	10034940	Yeah.
10034940	10036700	It, you know, it just astounds me.
10036700	10041420	And, you know, you know, the follow up on, you know, what I also said is that, you know,
10042220	10049980	I do agree with you that entertainment today actually requires, you know, you know, technology
10050940	10051900	and it has evolved.
10051900	10054140	I mean, hell, that is what the saying is.
10054140	10056540	Art is alive and it evolves.
10056540	10063100	I mean, you know, like I said in chat was, you know, the gladiatorial arts was the entertainment
10063100	10071420	for the Roman society and it now has evolved to cage fighting, boxing, if you want storyline,
10071420	10073020	pro wrestling, you know.
10073020	10078620	And so I've been actually studying up on this and seeing how, you know, all these forms
10078620	10086940	of entertainment, obviously still some entertainments, you know, are a little, you know, they cling
10088540	10091820	to their old ways, you know, tradition, which I do respect.
10091820	10097820	You know, there's obviously plays and playwrights and it, you know, as a matter of fact, you
10097820	10103580	know, what you and Jessica Harper recently did with Rocky Horror, you know.
10103580	10108460	I mean, that is a, you know, a form of evolution from, you know, the plays and playwrights
10108460	10110860	and, you know, it's becoming, you know.
10112860	10117500	It's funny you bring that up because that in particular is something that is, I actually
10117500	10118780	was at Rocky Horror last night.
10118780	10122540	That's why I got home at five in the morning because I was with one of the Bay Area cast
10122540	10125340	who was celebrating their 17th birthday as a cast.
10125340	10127100	Rocky Horror, I know, right?
10127100	10131900	Rocky Horror is something that's been around for 35 years, but it is interesting.
10131900	10132860	You talk about it.
10132860	10134620	Oh God, I could fill another show with this.
10135180	10136780	You just set me on a tangent.
10136780	10140860	It is interesting that that whole stuff could be considered another art form because there's
10140860	10146060	other movies now that, you know, people want to kind of shadow cast and bring to that.
10146060	10149900	And especially with the group I've been working with here in Sacramento, they really have
10149900	10150860	made an art out of it.
10150860	10155020	I mean, I know I'm talking them up, but you've got to see the way they do repo the genetic
10155020	10155820	opera.
10155820	10159980	I mean, like that movie for all practical purposes is kind of stupid.
10159980	10165500	But when you see the stage show of it, you're like, is this shit for real?
10165500	10167260	This is crazy.
10167260	10170220	And I mean, words can only came and describe it.
10170220	10174140	You know, it is the exactly the atmosphere.
10174140	10177500	And now they're talking about doing it for, and I don't know how much I'm supposed to
10177500	10180540	stay on my little radio show or not, but now they're talking about doing it for the room.
10180540	10183340	And there was talk about doing Scott Pilgrim versus the world at one point.
10183340	10184380	They've had to put that on hold.
10184380	10187420	I think it's a rights thing, but that was like going to be a thing.
10188060	10193020	So, yeah, well, Jessica said something last night on under sedation life that she was
10193020	10195580	actually going to be doing something that involves the room.
10195580	10200780	Yeah, I, I, I, I have mixed feelings about the room, but anyway, we'll leave that to
10200780	10201420	another show.
10202300	10202620	All right.
10202620	10204780	But let me, let me, let me go back to video games of this.
10204780	10209500	I want to ask you about this so, so we can wrap up, um, because you did kind of make
10209500	10211100	the comment on Facebook.
10211180	10219260	Let me ask you, what would you like to see happen next with the video game movie working
10219260	10221180	hand in hand together in this fusion?
10221180	10223340	What would you see like to see happen next with that?
10223340	10226140	Or do you think we need to stop obsessing about it?
10227340	10232940	Honestly, I think we need to stop obsessing for, uh, on it because you know, you look
10232940	10240460	at the past, the two industries never really, you know, you know, they never really, you
10240460	10245740	know, generate a form of like something that's really successful.
10245740	10251340	There's never been a real successful video game that has been based off of movie and
10251340	10258380	you have never really seen a movie, a very successful movie, uh, you know, uh, being
10258380	10259500	based off of a game.
10259500	10265020	I don't see Oscar winning award games and I know we all want to see Mass Effect on the
10265020	10268140	big screen and you want to see Warcraft on the big screen.
10269100	10272060	But those movies are gonna suck.
10272060	10276300	Let's be, if you are a fan of those games, there is no possible way those movies are
10276300	10277500	going to satisfy you.
10277500	10284780	And I think I really do see your point here because there is no possible way, no possible
10284780	10289820	way you can adapt the Mass Effect games into a movie and leave people satisfied.
10289820	10295340	They will be pissed just like Harry Potter fans always are mad that the books aren't
10295340	10296700	adapted correctly.
10296780	10300700	I'm sure somebody's got a problem with Lord of the Rings, although to be fair, they do
10300700	10301260	it okay.
10301260	10304860	But I mean, it's just Mass Effect is a video game.
10304860	10306460	It is not going to work as a movie.
10306460	10310460	But here's why Wreck-It Ralph worked because Wreck-It Ralph wasn't a game.
10310460	10313180	It was a movie about gaming culture.
10313980	10314620	Exactly.
10315580	10322700	And I think, and that's why Hope is just, is viewed as a story that, you know, revolve,
10322700	10326860	you know, and it's a little bit, you know, involves the characters that we all love to
10326860	10327580	play with.
10327580	10331180	But I just hope it doesn't go past that.
10331180	10336220	It's like, you know, and still is, you know, conceived as a, you know, what video games
10336220	10341180	are today as, you know, a child's toy because we have progressed so much beyond that point.
10342300	10342620	All right.
10342620	10345820	Well, Degener, Johnny, I gotta let you go so we can see if we can get another call and
10345820	10346540	wrap up the show.
10346540	10347660	But great phone call.
10347660	10348460	Don't be a stranger.
10349020	10349420	All right.
10349420	10349740	All right.
10349740	10350620	Take care.
10350620	10351120	Bye.
10351120	10352480	Bye.
10352480	10353200	Really good points.
10353200	10357200	We, I, he hasn't called into the show an awful lot, but I like some of the stuff, some of
10357200	10358320	the points he was raising there.
10358320	10360080	So definitely worth talking to.
10360080	10360720	Appreciate it.
10361440	10363120	We are the show where every gamer has a voice.
10363120	10367200	1-877-GAME-OLR or our username on Skype is OrangeLoungeRadio.
10367200	10370160	If we can get another call in here real quick, we'll take it.
10370160	10372720	Otherwise, we might just wrap up for the night.
10372720	10376640	Let me go to Twitter though, cause I still had some more of these tweets I wanted to
10376640	10382240	get to, including one from Tiger Claw that talks about the Halo 4 Amex card thing.
10382960	10387360	I remember reading a little bit about this, but you know, I don't have an American Express
10387360	10390480	myself, so I just kind of scrolled on by.
10390480	10395280	But apparently there is a, excuse me, there is a partnership between Microsoft and American
10395280	10399760	Express so that if you are a card holder, you get coupons and credits for tying your
10399760	10402240	account to Xbox Live and playing Halo 4.
10403840	10404960	Very interesting.
10404960	10410240	If you sync your Amex account to your Xbox Live account, you can get coupons to theaters,
10410240	10411600	packs on, dah, dah, dah, dah.
10412240	10416560	An automatic credit of $10 in the US or 10 pounds in the UK.
10416560	10421040	If you play Halo 4, you get credits and coupons on your in-game achievements.
10422640	10426880	If you complete the single-player campaign on normal or harder difficulty, you get a
10426880	10429040	$25 statement credit.
10429120	10435920	If you are one of the first 25 people in the US to complete the campaign alone on legendary
10436560	10443200	difficulty, you will be entered to win a trip to the 2013 Electronic Entertainment Expo.
10443200	10448960	Well, that's not irritating or anything because, you know, E3 is a very exclusive thing to
10448960	10452960	be able to get into, but apparently you can win your way in through Amex.
10454320	10457440	I'm glad that the integrity is being kept up.
10457440	10464320	Yes, I'm so glad that we're keeping the independent press out of the events for the nasty, filthy
10464320	10468720	things they'll say about it on the internet, yet we're gonna let a contest winner from
10468720	10471840	American Express get their way into the show.
10471840	10473280	Uh-huh, I see how it is.
10475120	10477520	Let's see, you talked about the Wizard of the Coast lawsuit thing, right?
10477520	10479280	Because we have a tweet on that, but you already talked about that.
10480320	10482800	Let's see, another tweet from actdeft.
10484000	10486400	Is DRM going too far?
10487440	10491360	Sorry, I'm reading the story here real quick.
10491360	10491920	Let me look at this.
10493280	10494240	The title of the...
10494240	10495840	This is a forum post, okay?
10496560	10499600	He links us to a forum post on overclock.net.
10499600	10505360	Razor Synapse 2.0 software mouse unusable if you don't have an internet connection.
10506000	10512640	The poster, who goes by Channel X99, just bought a new Naga 2012 mouse, installed the
10512640	10516160	software, and got greeted by a login screen right after.
10516160	10519600	No option to bypass it to use the software to configure the mouse.
10519600	10522720	Set the options, sensitivity, shortcuts, macros, etc.
10522720	10524880	So I create an account and try to log in.
10524880	10525600	Nothing.
10525600	10527200	Try several more times.
10527200	10527840	Nothing.
10527840	10528960	Try to make new accounts.
10528960	10531040	Different email addresses won't work.
10531040	10536400	Finally, call Razor, who tells me the activation server is down, and I won't be able to use
10536400	10541040	the mouse until it goes back up, and will only be able to use it as a standard plug
10541040	10542400	and play mouse till then.
10542960	10547760	I ask about a workaround to use the mouse offline, and they say there is none.
10549200	10550160	That's a stupid...
10550160	10552800	That's completely awful.
10552800	10555280	That I would be writing a letter to the Better Business Bureau.
10555280	10556960	Which I'm about to be doing for Origin.
10558720	10560240	But D.R., you can't...
10561440	10563680	Do they sell counterfeit mice?
10563680	10564560	I mean, is that a thing?
10564560	10569760	I don't want to get political, but I'm honest to God, this is the first thought that jumps
10569760	10570800	into my mind.
10570880	10574880	There's this very controversial proposition on the ballot in California.
10574880	10576400	It's Prop 37.
10576400	10579360	And it has to do with labeling certain types of food.
10579360	10583120	I'm not going to get into where I'm leaning on this proposition or whatever.
10583120	10584080	I'm just going to say it's...
10585520	10591040	If it passes, there's going to be additional warning labels on food and restrictions on
10591040	10593040	what can be called a natural food or not.
10594240	10598800	The reason why I bring that up, that mouse ought to carry a fucking sticker on it.
10598800	10599760	Bright and big.
10599760	10604160	Will not work without an internet connection because you, the buyer, have the right to
10604160	10605840	know that shit before you buy it.
10607200	10608720	Take the mouse back, buddy.
10608720	10610080	Especially a mouse like that.
10610080	10611520	We're not talking like a $20 mouse.
10611520	10614240	We're talking like $100 plus mice.
10615680	10617600	There is no reason...
10617600	10619680	There should be a warning label on that mouse.
10620560	10622720	And any video game that requires this shit.
10624000	10626640	Because an internet connection is an additional fee, right?
10626640	10630880	Most MMOs I've played who have a sticker requires internet connection to play.
10630880	10631840	Even games.
10631840	10635520	Okay, that's a little understandable that they have DRM because they want to avoid piracy.
10635520	10640480	What the fuck is DRM supposed to be for like an accessory, hardware?
10640480	10644640	What the fuck do you need DRM for for a mouse?
10644640	10645680	Shouldn't there be like...
10645680	10650480	I hate to sound stupid and I might by saying this, but I don't care.
10650480	10655760	Shouldn't there be like antitrust shit involved because you're forcing somebody to log up
10655760	10660240	for your crap because you bought this particular product at the store?
10661120	10668240	It's like you're making somebody sign up for this other service because of your foothold
10668240	10669280	in the mouse keyboard.
10670320	10672480	Isn't there a questionable legality to that?
10673840	10676800	I mean, maybe because we're talking about a mice and keyboard company.
10676800	10679680	It's kind of a niche market at gamers.
10679680	10685200	They do have their $2,500 laptop that's coming out this week as well.
10685760	10686080	Hmm.
10688240	10688640	Let's see.
10688640	10691520	Go into our chat room at live.vognetwork.com.
10691520	10695120	TigerClaw says the only thing I'm doing with the mouse or keyboard is turning the LEDs
10695120	10696000	on or off.
10696000	10699280	So when I go to bed, I just load up the software to turn them off.
10699280	10703680	All other features it has I don't use because that's mostly features associated to gaming.
10705280	10711840	One more tweet from actdeft who says fairy solitaire is free to download on steam for
10711840	10712560	a few days.
10713760	10714400	Who knew that?
10715200	10715920	Get it now.
10715920	10717120	Keep it forever.
10717120	10722480	If you want the addicting card game fairy solitaire where you find and raise a fairy
10722480	10727760	pet and repopulate the magical land of Avalon using the resources found by clearing each
10727760	10728400	level.
10728400	10731360	Sounds like you can get that on steam for free right now.
10732000	10735600	And honestly, you should if you're even if you're not really that interested in it, if
10735600	10738160	you're mildly interested because hey, it's free.
10738160	10740560	I know I'm giggling there, but you know what?
10740560	10742320	Props to them making it free.
10742320	10743200	How can you?
10744080	10745600	I'm sure it's better than Yaris.
10748000	10751360	That is a very low bar to take seed there.
10753280	10759280	All right, that's going to do it for our Twitter topic tonight and the other interactive parts
10759280	10759840	of our show.
10761040	10762720	We're going to close up shop.
10764640	10766720	And Skype just like freeze my computer.
10767840	10768720	Thanks Skype.
10768720	10770880	You drop the live listeners and everything.
10770880	10772160	Sorry, that was Skype's fault.
10772560	10773520	Not Comcast fault.
10773520	10774480	That was Skype's fault.
10775040	10776320	Sorry for the stream drop there.
10777280	10777600	All right.
10777600	10781920	Anyhow, that's going to do it for telephone calls and Twitter and all that good stuff.
10781920	10783520	Let's send the show.
10783520	10785280	Do you have any other last minute stories either?
10785280	10786560	You guys have something to say?
10786560	10786720	Yeah.
10786720	10788320	What tomorrow is my mom's birthday.
10788320	10789280	So happy birthday, mom.
10789280	10790320	Even though you don't listen.
10790320	10792960	Happy birthday to dark soccer's mom, even though she doesn't listen.
10792960	10793460	Yeah.
10794160	10796080	Loki, any other last minute stories or anything?
10796080	10797120	It's about slow news.
10797120	10800880	We have anything MXC and chat says don't knock it.
10800880	10804480	I tried playing fairy solitaire on a whim and can't stop playing.
10804480	10805840	It's been three hours.
10808640	10812000	I have another thing to say, but I'll say it for last.
10812000	10813360	I want to quickly say this.
10813360	10818640	Shane, if you're listening and you're in chat, will you link the listeners that game you
10818640	10821040	were talking to me earlier on Warcraft about?
10821040	10822080	It was hilarious.
10822080	10823840	I wish she'd called in to talk about it.
10823840	10825680	It sounded hilarious.
10825680	10830640	You like start playing the game and it looks like an edutainment title that's about fractions,
10830640	10835680	but then he was talking about how like it just starts pulling, like it gets weirder
10835680	10841520	and weirder and weirder and like suddenly you're like at the top of this government
10841520	10845200	conspiracy and it turns into a text adventure game.
10845840	10850320	Like he was like, I, I tried playing it for 30 seconds and I'm like, I don't get the joke.
10850320	10851520	This is a stupid game.
10851520	10852400	Close window.
10852400	10855760	But then he was telling me about it on vent and I was like laughing because it sounded
10855760	10856720	really ridiculous.
10856720	10860720	So if he's not listening, I'll get the link from him and we can talk about it next week
10860720	10863680	because Loki, I think you of all of us should probably play this game.
10863680	10864480	It sounds like something you'd get.
10864480	10865440	Sounds awesome.
10865440	10866960	You like flash games that are weird.
10867600	10868320	All right.
10868320	10869920	Um, okay.
10869920	10871680	Let's go around to get everybody's final thought.
10871680	10874000	Jamie, you had something in mind already, so I'll start with you tonight.
10874000	10874560	Your final thought.
10874560	10875360	I'm going to wreck it.
10877600	10880320	My final thought tonight is baked potato.
10881040	10882400	Loki, your final thought tonight?
10882400	10884480	Um, mob arena.
10884480	10889440	Hopefully they'll be coming soon and otherwise check out the map that we have for the vog
10889440	10889760	server.
10889760	10891520	If you're not part of it, you should join.
10892480	10898480	It's fun and you get to build stuff, but if you want to check out the map, vogmc.co.cc
10898480	10900080	and you can check out what we're building.
10900720	10901120	Peek in.
10902480	10904720	That's going to do it for another episode of orange launch radio.
10904720	10908000	Thank you guys so much for downloading our show or listening to us live.
10908000	10910400	However you choose to participate with orange launch radio.
10910400	10911440	We really appreciate it.
10911520	10914000	You know, we've said this a lot, but it is true.
10914000	10915440	We're an independent show.
10915440	10917040	We don't ask for anything.
10917040	10919120	Please just tell a friend or two.
10919120	10920080	I guess this is something.
10920080	10924000	I mean, we don't ask for money and stuff, but, uh, I like money that you can just give
10924000	10924640	it to me.
10924640	10927920	A tell a friend or two or five about the show.
10927920	10929360	Help spread the word.
10929360	10931520	The voting in the podcast towards we talked about earlier.
10931520	10935040	That's a great way to do that, but you know, there's other ways to spread the word to
10935040	10936000	tell a friend.
10936000	10937600	Give us a nice review somewhere.
10937600	10939280	Help spread the word of orange launch radio.
10939280	10940960	Let's get some other voices in the community.
10941040	10944320	We had some great discussion tonight on a lot of different topics.
10944320	10945040	This is a good show.
10945040	10947840	This is a very grown up show, very grown up show.
10947840	10950400	So we need some more special episode of orange lounge.
10950400	10952320	Remember it was, it was a very special voter.
10952320	10953360	P Diddy will kill you.
10953360	10953840	That's right.
10953840	10955840	And vote or P Diddy will kill you.
10955840	10958480	And of course we're talking about the podcast exactly.
10959840	10962480	And now we mean the election on Tuesday.
10962480	10963120	It's your friends.
10963120	10966400	The vote to for both more the merrier.
10966400	10966960	That's right.
10966960	10967360	All right.
10967360	10968080	Thanks you guys.
10968080	10968960	Have a wonderful night.
